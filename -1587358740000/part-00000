{"title_page": "John Richard Clark Hall", "text_new": "'''John Richard Clark Hall''' (1855 \u2013 6 August 1931) was a scholar of [[Old English]], notable for his work on ''[[Beowulf]]''. In 1894 he published a dictionary of Anglo-Saxon words,{{sfn|Hausmann|Reichmann|Weigand|Zgusta|1990|p=1443}} which he followed up with complete verse and metrical translations of the poem.{{sfn|Osborn|2014}} His 1901 translation was the tenth to be published in English; a metrical translation followed in 1914,{{sfn|Hall|1914}} and in 1940 was edited by [[Charles Leslie Wrenn]].{{sfn|Osborn|2014}}\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJohn Richard Clark Hall was born in 1855,{{sfn|Hausmann|Reichmann|Weigand|Zgusta|1990}} and was the only son of James John Hall.{{sfn|Foster|1889|p=491}} He received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] from the [[University of London]] in 1889,{{sfn|''The Times''|1889}} and in 1891 received a [[Master of Arts]] in English and French from the same school.{{sfn|''The Times''|1891}} By 1894, he had received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]]{{sfn|Hall|1894|p=i}} On 16 May 1881, then a clerk in the [[Local Government Board]], Hall was admitted to [[Gray's Inn]].{{sfn|Foster|1889|p=491}}\n\n== Career ==\nHall published multiple editions of ''A Concise Anglo-Saxon Dictionary'',{{sfn|Hausmann|Reichmann|Weigand|Zgusta|1990}} and two translations of the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] epic poem ''[[Beowulf]]''.{{sfn|Osborn|2014}}\n\n=== ''A Concise Anglo-Saxon Dictionary'' ===\nHall's dictionary of [[Old English]], subtitled ''For the Use of Students'',{{sfn|Hall|1894}} quickly became a standard upon its publication in 1894.{{sfn|Chermayeff|1962}} The work offered a significantly more complete reference than the prevailing dictionary at the time, [[Joseph Bosworth]]'s ''[[An Anglo-Saxon Dictionary]]''.{{sfn|Chase|1895|pp=50, 52}}{{sfn|''Journal of Education''|1895}}{{sfn|''The Journal of Education''|1894}} \"At last\", wrote ''The Guardian'', \"we have a complete Anglo-Saxon dictionary, complete form A to the very end of the alphabet.\"{{sfn|''The Guardian''|1895}} Even after Bosworth's work was revised by [[Thomas Northcote Toller]]'s in 1898, ''A Concise Anglo-Saxon Dictionary'' continued to serve prominently as an introductory resource.{{sfn|Garnett|1898|pp=327\u2013328}} \n\nThe first edition of the dictionary attempted to ease access by ordering entries by the words as they were actually spelled in common editions of [[Old English]] texts, and critics noted that this introduced its own share of confusion.{{sfn|Chase|1895|pp=50\u201351}}{{sfn|Hausmann|Reichmann|Weigand|Zgusta|1990}} Hall eliminated this approach in a 1916 second edition, acknowledging that this \"was admittedly an unscientific [approach], and opened the door to a good many errors and inconsistencies\".{{sfn|Hall|1916|p=v}} Thenceforth he adopted the conventional method of using \"normalised\" entry words.{{sfn|Hausmann|Reichmann|Weigand|Zgusta|1990}} Hall also began indicating words found only in poetical texts and providing the source of words recorded only once, and added cross references to corresponding entries in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary|New English Dictionary]]'', then underway.{{sfn|Klaeber|1918|p=154}}{{sfn|Hausmann|Reichmann|Weigand|Zgusta|1990}} The edition was \"markedly superior to the first edition\" according to a reviewer for ''[[Modern Philology]]'',{{sfn|Knott|1917}} and according to [[Frederick Klaeber]], \"[i]ts outward make-up is almost an ideal one.\"{{sfn|Klaeber|1918|p=153}}\n\nA third and significantly expanded edition followed in 1931;{{sfn|Hall|1931}} according to [[Francis Peabody Magoun]], it was \"to all intents and purposes [a] completely new edition\", and \"a notable monument to the memory of its author\", who died the year of publication.{{sfn|Magoun|1932|p=288}} A fourth edition\u2014a reprinting with a supplement by Herbert Dean Meritt{{sfn|Muinzer|1963|p=786}}{{sfn|Campbell|1962}}\u2014came in 1960.{{sfn|Hall|Meritt|1960}} This was itself reprinted by the [[University of Toronto Press]] starting in 1984,{{sfn|Hall|Meritt|1984}}{{sfn|Hausmann|Reichmann|Weigand|Zgusta|1990}} and is still in print as of 2020.{{sfn|University of Toronto Press}}\n\n=== ''Beowulf'' ===\nIn 1901, after publication of the first edition of his dictionary, Hall published a literal translation of ''Beowulf''.{{sfn|Hall|1901}} It was the tenth [[English language|English]] translation of the work.{{sfn|Osborn|2014}}{{refn|group=note|The eighth translation, in 1892, had also been translated by a John Hall, [[John Lesslie Hall]].{{sfn|Osborn|2014}}}} It was lauded at its outset for containing both a \"decidedly better\" translation than any in current use, as wrote ''[[The Guardian|The Manchester Guardian]]'',{{sfn|The Manchester Guardian|1901}} and what [[Chauncey Brewster Tinker]] described as \"a useful compendium of Beowulf material\".{{sfn|Tinker|1902|p=379}} The first edition was followed by a corrected second in 1911.{{sfn|Hall|1911}}{{sfn|Windle|1912}} Such revision was \"welcome\", wrote [[Allen Mawer]], \"for it is probably the best working translation that we have\".{{sfn|Mawer|1911}} The work became \"the standard trot to ''Beowulf''\";{{sfn|Chickering Jr.|1967|p=774}} according to [[Marijane Osborn]] it was \"still the 'crib of choice' in Oxford in the 1960s\".{{sfn|Osborn|1997|p=342}}\n\nHall followed up his literal ''Beowulf'' translation with a [[Metre (poetry)|metrical]] translation in 1914.{{sfn|Hall|1914}} Writing for ''[[Modern Language Review|The Modern Language Review]]'', a W. G. Sedgefield{{sfn|''The Manchester Guardian''|1945}} suggested that \"[i]n attempting to make a metrical version of the ''Beowulf'' in modern English, Dr Clark Hall has undertaken one of the most difficult tasks possible for a translator, and we intend no reflection on his ability and scholarship when we say that in our opinion he has not succeeded.\"{{sfn|Sedgefield|1915|p=387}} Noting the difficulties of translating the poem, and what he termed \"arbitrar[y]\" choices by Hall, Sedgefield concluded that \"Dr Hall would have done well not to try to improve on his excellent prose version of the poem.\"{{sfn|Sedgefield|1915|p=389}} The translation did not see a second edition.{{sfn|Osborn|2014}}\n\nIn 1940, after Hall's death, his prose translation was revised by [[Charles Leslie Wrenn]], and again in 1950;{{sfn|Osborn|2014}} this latter edition included a preface by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]].{{sfn|Hall|1950}}\n\n== Personal life ==\nHall married Mary Ann Elizabeth Symes on 29 November 1883.{{sfn|Dorset Marriages|1883}} The two had four children, three of whom survived: Cecil Symes (born {{circa}} 1887), Irene Clark (born {{circa}} 1886), and the entomologist [[Wilfrid Hall|Wilfrid John]] (born 1892).{{sfn|England Census|1891}}{{sfn|England Census|1911}}{{sfn|''Who Was Who''|2007}}\n\nHall was a member of the [[Yorkshire Philosophical Society]], joining in 1910.{{sfn|Yorkshire Philosophical Society|1911}} He died in 1931.{{sfn|The Scotsman|1931}} He had been living in [[Eastbourne]] in [[East Sussex]].{{sfn|The Scotsman|1931}} His obituary labeled him a \"protestant reformer\", noted that he had formerly been on the Local Government Board in [[Whitehall]], and that he had a net [[Personal property|personalty]] of \u00a313,309 and a gross of \u00a315,762.{{sfn|The Scotsman|1931}}{{sfn|''The Manchester Guardian''|1931}}\n\n== Publications ==\n=== Books ===\n*

In 1894 he published a dictionary of Anglo-Saxon words,{{sfn|Hausmann|Reichmann|Weigand|Zgusta|1990|p=1443}} which he followed up with complete verse and metrical translations of the poem.{{sfn|Osborn|2014}} His 1901 translation was the tenth to be published in English; a metrical translation followed in 1914,{{sfn|Hall|1914}} and in 1940 was edited by [[Charles Leslie Wrenn]].{{sfn|Osborn|2014}}\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJohn Richard Clark Hall was born in 1855,{{sfn|Hausmann|Reichmann|Weigand|Zgusta|1990}} and was the only son of James John Hall.{{sfn|Foster|1889|p=491}} He received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] from the [[University of London]] in 1889,{{sfn|''The Times''|1889}} and in 1891 received a [[Master of Arts]] in English and French from the same school.{{sfn|''The Times''|1891}} By 1894, he had received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]]{{sfn|Hall|1894|p=i}} On 16 May 1881, then a clerk in the [[Local Government Board]], Hall was admitted to [[Gray's Inn]].{{sfn|Foster|1889|p=491}}\n\n== Career ==\nHall published multiple editions of ''A Concise Anglo-Saxon Dictionary'',{{sfn|Hausmann|Reichmann|Weigand|Zgusta|1990}} and two translations of the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] epic poem ''[[Beowulf]]''.{{sfn|Osborn|2014}}\n\n=== ''A Concise Anglo-Saxon Dictionary'' ===\nHall's dictionary of [[Old English]], subtitled ''For the Use of Students'',{{sfn|Hall|1894}} quickly became a standard upon its publication in 1894.{{sfn|Chermayeff|1962}} The work offered a significantly more complete reference than the prevailing dictionary at the time, [[Joseph Bosworth]]'s ''[[An Anglo-Saxon Dictionary]]''.{{sfn|Chase|1895|pp=50, 52}}{{sfn|''Journal of Education''|1895}}{{sfn|''The Journal of Education''|1894}} \"At last\", wrote ''The Guardian'', \"we have a complete Anglo-Saxon dictionary, complete form A to the very end of the alphabet.\"{{sfn|''The Guardian''|1895}} Even after Bosworth's work was revised by [[Thomas Northcote Toller]]'s in 1898, ''A Concise Anglo-Saxon Dictionary'' continued to serve prominently as an introductory resource.{{sfn|Garnett|1898|pp=327\u2013328}} \n\nThe first edition of the dictionary attempted to ease access by ordering entries by the words as they were actually spelled in common editions of [[Old English]] texts, and critics noted that this introduced its own share of confusion.{{sfn|Chase|1895|pp=50\u201351}}{{sfn|Hausmann|Reichmann|Weigand|Zgusta|1990}} Hall eliminated this approach in a 1916 second edition, acknowledging that this \"was admittedly an unscientific [approach], and opened the door to a good many errors and inconsistencies\".{{sfn|Hall|1916|p=v}} Thenceforth he adopted the conventional method of using \"normalised\" entry words.{{sfn|Hausmann|Reichmann|Weigand|Zgusta|1990}} Hall also began indicating words found only in poetical texts and providing the source of words recorded only once, and added cross references to corresponding entries in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary|New English Dictionary]]'', then underway.{{sfn|Klaeber|1918|p=154}}{{sfn|Hausmann|Reichmann|Weigand|Zgusta|1990}} The edition was \"markedly superior to the first edition\" according to a reviewer for ''[[Modern Philology]]'',{{sfn|Knott|1917}} and according to [[Frederick Klaeber]], \"[i]ts outward make-up is almost an ideal one.\"{{sfn|Klaeber|1918|p=153}}\n\nA third and significantly expanded edition followed in 1931;{{sfn|Hall|1931}} according to [[Francis Peabody Magoun]], it was \"to all intents and purposes [a] completely new edition\", and \"a notable monument to the memory of its author\", who died the year of publication.{{sfn|Magoun|1932|p=288}} A fourth edition\u2014a reprinting with a supplement by Herbert Dean Meritt{{sfn|Muinzer|1963|p=786}}{{sfn|Campbell|1962}}\u2014came in 1960.{{sfn|Hall|Meritt|1960}} This was itself reprinted by the [[University of Toronto Press]] starting in 1984,{{sfn|Hall|Meritt|1984}}{{sfn|Hausmann|Reichmann|Weigand|Zgusta|1990}} and is still in print as of 2020.{{sfn|University of Toronto Press}}\n\n=== ''Beowulf'' ===\nIn 1901, after publication of the first edition of his dictionary, Hall published a literal translation of ''Beowulf''.{{sfn|Hall|1901}} It was the tenth [[English language|English]] translation of the work.{{sfn|Osborn|2014}}{{refn|group=note|The eighth translation, in 1892, had also been translated by a John Hall, [[John Lesslie Hall]].{{sfn|Osborn|2014}}}} It was lauded at its outset for containing both a \"decidedly better\" translation than any in current use, as wrote ''[[The Guardian|The Manchester Guardian]]'',{{sfn|The Manchester Guardian|1901}} and what [[Chauncey Brewster Tinker]] described as \"a useful compendium of Beowulf material\".{{sfn|Tinker|1902|p=379}} The first edition was followed by a corrected second in 1911.{{sfn|Hall|1911}}{{sfn|Windle|1912}} Such revision was \"welcome\", wrote [[Allen Mawer]], \"for it is probably the best working translation that we have\".{{sfn|Mawer|1911}} The work became \"the standard trot to ''Beowulf''\";{{sfn|Chickering Jr.|1967|p=774}} according to [[Marijane Osborn]] it was \"still the 'crib of choice' in Oxford in the 1960s\".{{sfn|Osborn|1997|p=342}}\n\nHall followed up his literal ''Beowulf'' translation with a [[Metre (poetry)|metrical]] translation in 1914.{{sfn|Hall|1914}} Writing for ''[[Modern Language Review|The Modern Language Review]]'', a W. G. Sedgefield{{sfn|''The Manchester Guardian''|1945}} suggested that \"[i]n attempting to make a metrical version of the ''Beowulf'' in modern English, Dr Clark Hall has undertaken one of the most difficult tasks possible for a translator, and we intend no reflection on his ability and scholarship when we say that in our opinion he has not succeeded.\"{{sfn|Sedgefield|1915|p=387}} Noting the difficulties of translating the poem, and what he termed \"arbitrar[y]\" choices by Hall, Sedgefield concluded that \"Dr Hall would have done well not to try to improve on his excellent prose version of the poem.\"{{sfn|Sedgefield|1915|p=389}} The translation did not see a second edition.{{sfn|Osborn|2014}}\n\nIn 1940, after Hall's death, his prose translation was revised by [[Charles Leslie Wrenn]], and again in 1950;{{sfn|Osborn|2014}} this latter edition included a preface by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]].{{sfn|Hall|1950}}\n\n== Personal life ==\nHall married Mary Ann Elizabeth Symes on 29 November 1883.{{sfn|Dorset Marriages|1883}} The two had four children, three of whom survived: Cecil Symes (born {{circa}} 1887), Irene Clark (born {{circa}} 1886), and the entomologist [[Wilfrid Hall|Wilfrid John]] (born 1892).{{sfn|England Census|1891}}{{sfn|England Census|1911}}{{sfn|''Who Was Who''|2007}}\n\nHall was a member of the [[Yorkshire Philosophical Society]], joining in 1910.{{sfn|Yorkshire Philosophical Society|1911}} He died in 1931.{{sfn|The Scotsman|1931}} He had been living in [[Eastbourne]] in [[East Sussex]].{{sfn|The Scotsman|1931}} His obituary labeled him a \"protestant reformer\", noted that he had formerly been on the Local Government Board in [[Whitehall]], and that he had a net [[Personal property|personalty]] of \u00a313,309 and a gross of \u00a315,762.{{sfn|The Scotsman|1931}}{{sfn|''The Manchester Guardian''|1931}}\n\n== Publications ==\n=== Books ===\n*

The test was a simulation of an electrical power outage to aid the development of a safety procedure for maintaining reactor cooling water circulation until the back-up electrical generators could provide power. This gap was about one minute and had been identified as a potential safety problem that could cause the [[nuclear reactor core]] to overheat. It was hoped to prove that the residual rotational energy in a turbine generator could provide enough power to cover the gap. Three such tests had been conducted since 1982, but they had failed to provide a solution. On this fourth attempt, an unexpected 10-hour delay meant that an unprepared operating shift was on duty.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Eden|first=Brad|last2=of Technical Services/Automated Lib|first2=Coordinator|date=January 1999|title=Encyclopaedia Britannica CD 99 (Multimedia version)|isbn=978-0-85229-694-3|journal=Electronic Resources Review|volume=3|issue=1|pages=9\u201310|doi=10.1108/err.1999.3.1.9.7|issn=1364-5137}}</ref> During the planned decrease of reactor power in preparation for the electrical test, the power unexpectedly dropped to a near-zero level. The operators were able to only partially restore the specified test power, which put the reactor in a potentially unstable condition. This risk was not made evident in the operating instructions, so the operators proceeded with the electrical test. Upon test completion, the operators triggered a reactor shutdown, but a combination of unstable conditions and reactor design flaws caused an uncontrolled [[nuclear chain reaction]] instead.<ref name=insag7/>{{rp|33}}           \n\nA large amount of energy was suddenly released, vaporising [[superheated water|superheated cooling water]] and rupturing the reactor core in a highly destructive [[steam explosion]].

As part of the test plan, extra water pumps were activated at 01:05, increasing the water flow. The increased coolant flow rate through the reactor produced an increase in the inlet coolant temperature of the reactor core (the coolant no longer having sufficient time to release its heat in the turbine and cooling towers), which now more closely approached the [[nucleate boiling]] temperature of water, reducing the [[factor of safety|safety margin]].\n\nThe flow exceeded the allowed limit at 01:19, triggering an alarm of low steam pressure in the steam separators. At the same time, the extra water flow lowered the overall core temperature and reduced the existing steam voids in the core and the steam separators.{{efn|The RBMK is a boiling water reactor, so in-core boiling is normal at higher power levels. The RBMK design has a negative [[void coefficient]] above 700&nbsp;MW.}} Since water weakly absorbs neutrons (and the higher density of liquid water makes it a better absorber than steam), the activation of the additional pumps decreased the reactor power. The crew responded by turning off two of the circulation pumps to reduce feedwater flow, in an effort to increase steam pressure, and by removing more manual control rods to maintain power.<ref name=\"OECD02-Ch1\">{{cite web |url=https://www.oecd-nea.org/rp/reports/2003/nea3508-chernobyl.pdf |title=Chernobyl: Assessment of Radiological and Health Impact, 2002 update; Chapter I \u2013 The site and accident sequence |website=OECD-NEA |year=2002 |accessdate=3 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622010856/https://www.oecd-nea.org/rp/reports/2003/nea3508-chernobyl.pdf |archive-date=22 June 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.physiciansofchernobyl.org.ua/rus/books/Karpan.html |title=N.

The reduction of reactor coolant pumping left little safety margin; any power excursion could produce boiling, thereby reducing [[neutron absorption]] by the water. The reactor configuration was outside the safe operating envelope prescribed by the designers.

The steam to the turbines was shut off, beginning a run-down of the turbine generator. The diesel generators started and sequentially picked up loads; the generators were to have completely picked up the MCPs' power needs by 01:23:43. In the interim, the power for the MCPs was to be supplied by the turbine generator as it coasted down. As the [[momentum]] of the turbine generator decreased, so did the power it produced for the pumps. The water flow rate decreased, leading to increased formation of steam voids in the coolant flowing up through the fuel pressure tubes.\n\nUnlike western [[light-water reactor]]s, the RBMK has a positive [[void coefficient]] of reactivity at low power levels. This means that the formation of bubbles (voids) from water boiling intensifies the nuclear chain reaction. The consequent power increase then produces more voids which further intensifies the chain reaction, and so on. Given this characteristic, reactor No.&nbsp;4 was now at risk of a runaway increase in its core power with nothing to restrain it.\n\nThroughout most of the experiment the local automatic control system (LAC) successfully counteracted this positive feedback, by inserting [[control rod]]s into the reactor core to limit the power rise.

The control rod insertion mechanism moved the rods at {{convert|0.4|m/s|foot/s}}, so that the rods took 18 to 20&nbsp;seconds to travel the full height of the [[nuclear reactor core|core]], about {{convert|7|m|ft}}. A bigger problem was the design of the [[RBMK#Control rods|RBMK control rods]], each of which had a graphite neutron moderator section attached to its end to boost reactor output by displacing water when the control rod section had been fully withdrawn from the reactor, i.e. when a control rod was at maximum extraction, a neutron-moderating graphite extension was centered in the core with {{convert|1.25|m|ft}} columns of water above and below it.\n\nConsequently, injecting a control rod downward into the reactor in a scram initially displaced (neutron-absorbing) water in the lower portion of the reactor with (neutron-moderating) graphite. Thus, an emergency scram initially increased the reaction rate in the lower part of the core.<ref name=insag7/>{{rp|4}} This behaviour had been discovered when the initial insertion of control rods in another RBMK reactor at [[Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant]] in 1983 induced a power spike. Procedural countermeasures were not implemented in response to Ignalina; INSAG-7 later stated, \"Apparently, there was a widespread view that the conditions under which the positive scram effect would be important would never occur. However, they did appear in almost every detail in the course of the actions leading to the (Chernobyl) accident.\"<ref name=insag7/>{{rp|13}}\n\nA few seconds into the scram, a power spike did occur and the core overheated, causing some of the [[fuel rod]]s to fracture, blocking the control rod columns and jamming the control rods at one-third insertion, with the graphite water-displacers still in the lower part of the core. Within three seconds the reactor output rose above 530&nbsp;MW.<ref name=\"MedvedevZ\"/>{{rp|31}}\n\nThe subsequent course of events was not registered by instruments; it has been reconstructed through mathematical simulation. Per the simulation, the power spike would have caused an increase in fuel temperature and steam buildup, leading to a rapid increase in steam pressure. This caused the fuel cladding to fail, releasing the fuel elements into the coolant, and rupturing the channels in which these elements were located.<ref>{{cite web |language=ru |url=http://www.reactors.narod.ru/pub/chern_2/chern_2.htm |title=Chernobyl as it was |website=narod.ru |access-date=29 April 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060517063327/http://www.reactors.narod.ru/pub/chern_2/chern_2.htm |archive-date=17 May 2006 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== Steam explosions ===\n[[File:Chernobyl_rubble_and_steam_tanks_overlaid.gif|thumb|upright=1.5| The reactor lid (upper biological shield)<ref name=\"interestingengineering.com\">{{cite web|url=https://interestingengineering.com/chernobyl-a-timeline-of-the-worst-nuclear-accident-in-history |title=Chernobyl \u2013 A Timeline of The Worst Nuclear Accident in History |date=11 May 2019 |first=Marcia |last=Wendorf |work=Interesting Engineering}}</ref> nicknamed \"Elena\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/03/books/review/adam-higginbotham-midnight-in-chernobyl.html |title=Looking Again at the Chernobyl Disaster |date=3 April 2019 |first=Robert P. |last=Crease |work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> lying on its side in the explosion crater.

This explosion also compromised more of the reactor containment vessel and ejected hot lumps of graphite moderator.

One view was that the second explosion was caused by the combustion of [[hydrogen]], which had been produced either by the overheated steam-[[zircaloy|zirconium]] reaction or by the [[Syngas|reaction of red-hot graphite with steam]] that produced hydrogen and [[carbon monoxide]]. Another hypothesis, by Checherov, published in 1998, was that the second explosion was a thermal explosion of the reactor as a result of the uncontrollable escape of [[fast neutron]]s caused by the complete water loss in the reactor core.<ref>{{cite book |language=ru |last=Checherov |first=K.

The operation was not completed until 8 May, after {{convert|20,000|t|LT ST}} of water were pumped out.\n\nWith the bubbler pool gone, a meltdown was less likely to produce a powerful steam explosion. To do so, the molten core would now have to reach the [[water table]] below the reactor. To reduce the likelihood of this, it was decided to freeze the earth beneath the reactor, which would also stabilize the foundations. Using oil [[well drilling]] equipment, the injection of liquid nitrogen began on 4 May. It was estimated that 25&nbsp;tonnes of liquid nitrogen per day would be required to keep the soil frozen at {{convert|\u2212100|C|F}}.<ref name=\"MedvedevZ\"/>{{rp|59}} This idea was soon scrapped.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://hawaiinewsdaily.com/2011/03/when-the-fukushima-meltdown-hits-groundwater |title=When the Fukushima Meltdown Hits Groundwater |first=Tom |last=Burnett |date=28 March 2011 |website=Hawai'i News Daily |access-date=20 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511134329/http://hawaiinewsdaily.com/2011/03/when-the-fukushima-meltdown-hits-groundwater/ |archive-date=11 May 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAs an alternative, [[coal miner]]s were deployed to excavate a tunnel below the reactor to make room for a cooling system. The final makeshift design for the cooling system was to incorporate a coiled formation of pipes cooled with water and covered on top with a thin thermally conductive graphite layer. The graphite layer as a natural [[refractory]] material would rapidly cool the suspected molten uranium oxide without burn through. This graphite cooling plate layer was to be encapsulated between two concrete layers, each one meter thick for stabilisation. This system was designed by Bolshov, the director of the Institute for Nuclear Safety and Development formed in 1988. Bolshov's graphite-concrete \"sandwich\" would be similar in concept to later [[core catcher]]s that are now part of many nuclear reactor designs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/catch-falling-core-lessons-chernobyl-russian-nuclear-industry|title=To Catch a Falling Core: Lessons of Chernobyl for Russian Nuclear Industry|date=18 September 2012|website=Pulitzer Center}}</ref>\n\nBolshov's graphite cooling plate, alongside the prior nitrogen injection proposal, were not used following the drop in aerial temperatures and indicative reports that the fuel melt had stopped. It was later determined that the fuel had passed through three storeys before coming to rest in one of a number of basement rooms.

But according to the IAEA's 1993 revised and final analysis INSAG-7 the main cause was the reactor's design.<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.insc.anl.gov/neisb/neisb4/NEISB_3.3.A1.html |chapter=Chernobyl (Chornobyl) Nuclear Power Plant |title=NEI Source Book |edition=4th |publisher=Nuclear Energy Institute |accessdate=31 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://timetravel.mementoweb.org/memento/2011/http://www.insc.anl.gov/neisb/neisb4/NEISB_3.3.A1.html |archivedate=2 July 2016 }}</ref>\n\nBoth views were heavily lobbied by different groups, including the reactor's designers, power plant personnel, and the Soviet and Ukrainian governments. \nOne reason there were such contradictory viewpoints and so much debate about the causes of the Chernobyl accident was that the primary data covering the disaster, as registered by the instruments and sensors, were not completely published in the official sources.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} Also, Soviet authorities identified a multitude of operator actions as regulation violations for the original 1986 report while no such regulations were in fact in place.<ref name=insag7/>{{rp|18}}\n\nThe primary cause of the accident was a major deficiency in safety features of the reactor design,<ref name=insag7/>{{rp|22}} in particular the \"positive scram\" effect that caused reactivity to increase when control rods were inserted to the reactor in certain conditions.<ref name=insag7/>{{rp|16}} This was caused by an overly positive void coefficient of the reactor and a deficiency in control rod design.<ref name=insag7/>{{rp|13}} To avoid such conditions, it was necessary for the operators to track the value of the reactor ORM ([[Reactivity (nuclear)|operational reactivity margin]]) during operation, but this value was not readily available to the operators in the control room<ref name=insag7/>{{rp|17}} and they were not aware of the safety significance of ORM.<ref name=insag7/>{{rp|14}}\n\nEven in the revised analysis, the human factor remains identified as a major element in causing the accident, particularly the operating crew's deviation from the test programme. \"Most reprehensibly, unapproved changes in the test procedure were deliberately made on the spot, although the plant was known to be in a very different condition from that intended for the test.\"<ref name=insag7/>{{rp|24}}\n\nBoth IAEA reports identify inadequate \"culture of safety\" at all levels as the third major factor of the accident. Deficiency in the safety culture was inherent not only at the operational stage (\"both the operating regulations and staff handled the disabling of the reactor protection easily enough: witness the length of time for which the emergency core cooling system was out of service while the reactor was operated at half power\"). The culture of safety was lacking also, and to no lesser extent, during activities at other stages in the lifetime of nuclear power plants (including design, engineering, construction, manufacture, and regulation). The poor quality of operating procedures and instructions, and their conflicting character, put a heavy burden on the operating crew, including the chief engineer. \"The accident can be said to have flowed from a deficient safety culture, not only at the Chernobyl plant, but throughout the Soviet design, operating and regulatory organizations for nuclear power that existed at that time.\"<ref name=\"insag7\"/>{{rp|24}}\n\n=== INSAG-1 report, 1986 ===\nThe first official explanation of the accident, later acknowledged to be erroneous, was published in August 1986. It effectively placed the blame on the power plant operators. To investigate the causes of the accident the [[IAEA]] created a group known as the [[International Nuclear Safety Group|International Nuclear Safety Advisory Group]] (INSAG), which in its report of 1986, INSAG-1, on the whole also supported this view, based on the data provided by the Soviets and the oral statements of specialists.<ref>{{cite report |url=http://www-ns.iaea.org/committees/insag.asp |title=Summary Report on the Post-Accident Review on the Chernobyl Accident |authors=IAEA Report INSAG-1 (International Nuclear Safety Advisory Group) |publisher=IAEA |location=Vienna |date=1986 |access-date=5 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091203123451/http://www-ns.iaea.org/committees/insag.asp |archivedate=3 December 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> In this view, the catastrophic accident was caused by gross violations of operating rules and regulations. \"During preparation and testing of the turbine generator under run-down conditions using the auxiliary load, personnel disconnected a series of technical protection systems and breached the most important operational safety provisions for conducting a technical exercise.\"<ref name=\"atom\"/>{{rp|311}}\n\nThe operator error was probably due to their lack of knowledge of [[nuclear reactor physics]] and [[nuclear engineering|engineering]], as well as lack of experience and training. According to these allegations, at the time of the accident the reactor was being operated with many key safety systems turned off, most notably the [[Emergency Core Cooling System]] (ECCS), LAR (Local Automatic control system), and AZ (emergency power reduction system). Personnel had an insufficient understanding of technical procedures involved with the nuclear reactor, and knowingly ignored regulations to speed test completion.<ref name=\"atom\"/>\n\n{{quote|The developers of the reactor plant considered this combination of events to be impossible and therefore did not allow for the creation of emergency protection systems capable of preventing the combination of events that led to the crisis, namely the intentional disabling of emergency protection equipment plus the violation of operating procedures.

Serious critical observations covered only general questions and did not address the specific reasons for the accident.\n\nThe following general picture arose from these observations, and several procedural irregularities also helped to make the accident possible, one of which was insufficient communication between the safety officers and the operators in charge of the experiment being run that night.\n\nThe reactor operators disabled safety systems down to the generators, which the test was really about. The main process computer, SKALA, was running in such a way that the main control computer could not shut down the reactor or even reduce power. Normally the computer would have started to insert all of the [[control rods]]. The computer would have also started the \"Emergency Core Protection System\" that introduces 24 control rods into the active zone within 2.5 seconds, which is still slow by 1986 standards. All control was transferred from the process computer to the human operators.\n\nOn the subject of the disconnection of safety systems, Valery Legasov said, in 1987, \"It was like airplane pilots experimenting with the engines in flight.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Edwards|1987|p=644}}</ref>\n\nThis view is reflected in numerous publications and also artistic works on the theme of the Chernobyl accident that appeared immediately after the accident,<ref name=MedvedevZ/> and for a long time remained dominant in the public consciousness and in popular publications.\n\n=== Soviet criminal trial ===\n{{Main|Individual involvement in the Chernobyl disaster}}\n\nA trial took place from 7 to 30 July 1987 in a makeshift courtroom setup in the House of Culture in Chernobyl, Ukraine.

Based on it, in 1992 the IAEA Nuclear Safety Advisory Group (INSAG) published an additional report, INSAG-7,<ref name=insag7/> that reviewed \"that part of the INSAG-1 report in which primary attention is given to the reasons for the accident,\" and was included the USSR State Commission report as Appendix I.<ref name=insag7/>\n\nIn this INSAG report, most of the earlier accusations against staff for breach of regulations were acknowledged to be either erroneous, based on incorrect information obtained in August 1986, or less relevant. This report reflected a different view of the main reasons for the accident, presented in Appendix I. According to this account, the operators' actions in turning off the Emergency Core Cooling System, interfering with the settings on the protection equipment, and blocking the level and pressure in the separator drum did not contribute to the original cause of the accident and its magnitude, although they may have been a breach of regulations. In fact, turning off the emergency system designed to prevent the two turbine generators from stopping was not a violation of regulations.<ref name=insag7/>\n\nHuman factors, however, contributed to the conditions that led to the disaster. These included operating the reactor at a low power level\u2014less than 700&nbsp;MW\u2014a level documented in the run-down test programme, and operating with a small ORM. The 1986 assertions of Soviet experts notwithstanding, regulations did not prohibit operating the reactor at this low power level.<ref name=insag7/>{{rp|18}}\n\nHowever, regulations did forbid operating the reactor with a small margin of reactivity. Yet \"post-accident studies have shown that the way in which the real role of the ORM is reflected in the Operating Procedures and design documentation for the RBMK-1000 is extremely contradictory\", and furthermore, \"ORM was not treated as an operational safety limit, violation of which could lead to an accident\".<ref name=insag7/>{{rp|34\u201325}}\n\nAccording to the INSAG-7 Report, the chief reasons for the accident lie in the peculiarities of physics and in the construction of the reactor. There are two such reasons:<ref name=insag7/>{{rp|18}}\n# The reactor had a dangerously large positive [[void coefficient of reactivity]]. The void coefficient is a measurement of how a reactor responds to increased steam formation in the water coolant. Most other reactor designs have a negative coefficient, i.e. the nuclear reaction rate slows when steam bubbles form in the coolant, since as the vapour phase in the reactor increases, fewer [[neutrons]] are slowed down. [[Fast neutron|Faster neutrons]] are less likely to split [[uranium]] atoms, so the reactor produces less power (a negative feedback). Chernobyl's RBMK reactor, however, used solid [[nuclear graphite|graphite]] as a [[neutron moderator]] to [[thermal neutrons|slow down the neutrons]], and the water in it, on the contrary, acts like a harmful [[neutron absorber]]. Thus neutrons are slowed down even if steam bubbles form in the water. Furthermore, because steam [[neutron capture|absorbs neutrons]] much less readily than water, increasing the intensity of vapourization means that more neutrons are able to split uranium atoms, increasing the reactor's power output. This makes the RBMK design very unstable at low power levels, and prone to suddenly increasing energy production to a dangerous level. This behaviour is counter-intuitive, and this property of the reactor was unknown to the crew.\n# A more significant flaw was in the design of the [[control rods]] that are inserted into the reactor to slow down the reaction. In the RBMK reactor design, the lower part of each control rod was made of graphite and was {{convert|1.3|m|ft|||}} shorter than necessary, and in the space beneath the rods were hollow channels filled with water. The upper part of the rod, the truly functional part that absorbs the neutrons and thereby halts the reaction, was made of [[boron carbide]]. With this design, when the rods are inserted into the reactor from the uppermost position, the graphite parts initially displace some water (which absorbs neutrons, as mentioned above), effectively causing fewer neutrons to be absorbed initially. Thus for the first few seconds of control rod activation, reactor power output is increased, rather than reduced as desired. This behaviour is counter-intuitive and was not known to the reactor operators.\n\nOther deficiencies besides these were noted in the RBMK-1000 reactor design, as were its non-compliance with accepted standards and with the requirements of nuclear reactor safety.

This facility is to serve as dry storage for used fuel assemblies from units 1\u20133 and other operational wastes, as well as material from decommissioning units 1\u20133 (which will be the first [[RBMK]] units decommissioned anywhere).\n\nA contract was signed in 1999 with Areva NP (now [[Framatome]]) for construction of ISF-2. In 2003, after a significant part of the storage structures had been built, technical deficiencies in the design concept became apparent. In 2007, Areva withdrew and [[Holtec International]] was contracted for a new design and construction of ISF-2. The new design was approved in 2010, work started in 2011, and construction was completed in August 2017.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Holtec-clear-to-start-testing-ISF2-at-Chernobyl |title=Holtec clear to start testing ISF2 at Chernobyl |date=4 August 2017 |work=[[World Nuclear Association|World Nuclear News]] |access-date=}}</ref>\n\nISF-2 is the world's largest nuclear fuel storage facility, expected to hold more than 21,000 fuel assemblies for at least 100 years. The project includes a processing facility able to cut the RBMK fuel assemblies and to place the material in canisters, to be filled with [[inert gas]] and welded shut. The canisters are then to be transported to [[dry cask storage|dry storage vaults]], where the fuel containers will be enclosed for up to 100 years. Expected processing capacity is 2,500 fuel assemblies per year.<ref name=\"WNA-Chernobyl\"/>\n\n==== Fuel-containing materials ====\nAccording to official estimates, about 95% of the fuel in reactor No.&nbsp;4 at the time of the accident (about {{convert|180|t|LT ST}}) remains inside the shelter, with a total radioactivity of nearly 18&nbsp;million [[curie]]s (670&nbsp;[[becquerel|PBq]]). The radioactive material consists of core fragments, dust, and lava-like \"fuel containing materials\" (FCM)\u2014also called \"[[Corium (nuclear reactor)|corium]]\"\u2014that flowed through the wrecked reactor building before hardening into a [[ceramic]] form.\n\nThree different lavas are present in the basement of the reactor building: black, brown, and a [[porous]] ceramic. The lava materials are [[silicate glass]]es with [[inclusion (mineral)|inclusions]] of other materials within them. The porous lava is brown lava that dropped into water and thus cooled rapidly. It is unclear how long the ceramic form will retard the release of radioactivity. From 1997 to 2002, a series of published papers suggested that the self-irradiation of the lava would convert all {{convert|1,200|t|LT ST}} into a submicrometre and mobile powder within a few weeks.<ref>{{cite journal |first=V. |last=Baryakhtar |first2=V. |last2=Gonchar |first3=A. |last3=Zhidkov |first4=V. |last4=Zhidkov |title=Radiation damages and self-sputtering of high-radioactive dielectrics: spontaneous emission of submicronic dust particles |journal=Condensed Matter Physics |year=2002 |volume=5 |number=3{31} |pages=449\u2013471 |url=http://www.icmp.lviv.ua/journal/zbirnyk.31/005/art05.pdf |doi=10.5488/cmp.5.3.449 |access-date=30 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101175848/http://www.icmp.lviv.ua/journal/zbirnyk.31/005/art05.pdf |archive-date=1 November 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIt has been reported that the degradation of the lava is likely to be a slow, gradual process, rather than sudden and rapid.<ref name=\"Borovoi2006\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10512-006-0079-3 |title=Nuclear fuel in the shelter |year=2006 |last1=Borovoi |first1=A.

The test was a simulation of an electrical power outage to aid the development of a safety procedure for maintaining reactor cooling water circulation until the back-up electrical generators could provide power. This gap was about one minute and had been identified as a potential safety problem that could cause the [[nuclear reactor core]] to overheat. It was hoped to prove that the residual rotational energy in a turbine generator could provide enough power to cover the gap. Three such tests had been conducted since 1982, but they had failed to provide a solution. On this fourth attempt, an unexpected 10-hour delay meant that an unprepared operating shift was on duty.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Eden|first=Brad|last2=of Technical Services/Automated Lib|first2=Coordinator|date=January 1999|title=Encyclopaedia Britannica CD 99 (Multimedia version)|isbn=978-0-85229-694-3|journal=Electronic Resources Review|volume=3|issue=1|pages=9\u201310|doi=10.1108/err.1999.3.1.9.7|issn=1364-5137}}</ref> During the planned decrease of reactor power in preparation for the electrical test, the power unexpectedly dropped to a near-zero level. The operators were able to only partially restore the specified test power, which put the reactor in a potentially unstable condition. This risk was not made evident in the operating instructions, so the operators proceeded with the electrical test. Upon test completion, the operators triggered a reactor shutdown, but a combination of unstable conditions and reactor design flaws caused an uncontrolled [[nuclear chain reaction]] instead.<ref name=insag7/>{{rp|33}}           \n\nA large amount of energy was suddenly released, vapourising [[superheated water|superheated cooling water]] and rupturing the reactor core in a highly destructive [[steam explosion]].

As part of the test plan, extra water pumps were activated at 01:05, increasing the water flow. The increased coolant flow rate through the reactor produced an increase in the inlet coolant temperature of the reactor core (the coolant no longer having sufficient time to release its heat in the turbine and cooling towers), which now more closely approached the [[nucleate boiling]] temperature of water, reducing the [[factor of safety|safety margin]].\n\nThe flow exceeded the allowed limit at 01:19, triggering an alarm of low steam pressure in the steam separators. At the same time, the extra water flow lowered the overall core temperature and reduced the existing steam voids in the core and the steam separators.{{efn|The RBMK is a boiling water reactor, so in-core boiling is normal at higher power levels. The RBMK design has a negative [[void coefficient]] above 700&nbsp;MW.}} Since water weakly absorbs neutrons (and the higher density of liquid water makes it a better absorber than steam), the activation of the additional pumps decreased the reactor power. The crew responded by turning off two of the circulation pumps to reduce feedwater flow, in an effort to increase steam pressure, and by removing more manual control rods to maintain power.<ref name=\"OECD02-Ch1\">{{cite web |url=https://www.oecd-nea.org/rp/reports/2003/nea3508-chernobyl.pdf |title=Chernobyl: Assessment of Radiological and Health Impact, 2002 update; Chapter I \u2013 The site and accident sequence |website=OECD-NEA |year=2002 |accessdate=3 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622010856/https://www.oecd-nea.org/rp/reports/2003/nea3508-chernobyl.pdf |archive-date=22 June 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.physiciansofchernobyl.org.ua/rus/books/Karpan.html |title=N.

The reduction of reactor coolant pumping left little safety margin; any power excursion could produce boiling, thereby reducing [[neutron absorption]] by the water. The reactor configuration was outside the safe operating envelope prescribed by the designers. If anything pushed it into supercriticality, it would be unable to recover automatically.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n== Accident ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2017}}\n\n=== Test execution ===\n[[File:RBMK Reaktor ChNPP-4.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|Plan view of reactor No. 4 core.

The steam to the turbines was shut off, beginning a run-down of the turbine generator. The diesel generators started and sequentially picked up loads; the generators were to have completely picked up the MCPs' power needs by 01:23:43. In the interim, the power for the MCPs was to be supplied by the turbine generator as it coasted down. As the [[momentum]] of the turbine generator decreased, so did the power it produced for the pumps. The water flow rate decreased, leading to increased formation of steam voids in the coolant flowing up through the fuel pressure tubes.\n\nUnlike western [[light-water reactor]]s, the RBMK has a positive [[void coefficient]] of reactivity at low power levels. This means that the formation of bubbles (voids) from water boiling intensifies the nuclear chain reaction. The consequent power increase then produces more voids which further intensifies the chain reaction, and so on. Given this characteristic, reactor No.&nbsp;4 was now at risk of a runaway increase in its core power with nothing to restrain it.\n\nThroughout most of the experiment the local automatic control system (LAC) successfully counteracted this positive feedback, by inserting [[control rod]]s into the reactor core to limit the power rise.

The control rod insertion mechanism moved the rods at {{convert|0.4|m/s|foot/s}}, so that the rods took 18 to 20&nbsp;seconds to travel the full height of the [[nuclear reactor core|core]], about {{convert|7|m|ft}}. A bigger problem was the design of the [[RBMK#Control rods|RBMK control rods]], each of which had a graphite neutron moderator section attached to its end to boost reactor output by displacing water when the control rod section had been fully withdrawn from the reactor, i.e. when a control rod was at maximum extraction, a neutron-moderating graphite extension was centered in the core with {{convert|1.25|m|ft}} columns of water above and below it.\n\nConsequently, injecting a control rod downward into the reactor in a scram initially displaced (neutron-absorbing) water in the lower portion of the reactor with (neutron-moderating) graphite. Thus, an emergency scram initially increased the reaction rate in the lower part of the core.<ref name=insag7/>{{rp|4}} This behaviour had been discovered when the initial insertion of control rods in another RBMK reactor at [[Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant]] in 1983 induced a power spike. Procedural countermeasures were not implemented in response to Ignalina; INSAG-7 later stated, \"Apparently, there was a widespread view that the conditions under which the positive scram effect would be important would never occur. However, they did appear in almost every detail in the course of the actions leading to the (Chernobyl) accident.\"<ref name=insag7/>{{rp|13}}\n\nA few seconds into the scram, a power spike did occur and the core overheated, causing some of the [[fuel rod]]s to fracture, blocking the control rod columns and jamming the control rods at one-third insertion, with the graphite water-displacers still in the lower part of the core. Within three seconds the reactor output rose above 530&nbsp;MW.<ref name=\"MedvedevZ\"/>{{rp|31}}\n\nThe subsequent course of events was not registered by instruments; it has been reconstructed through mathematical simulation. Per the simulation, the power spike would have caused an increase in fuel temperature and steam buildup, leading to a rapid increase in steam pressure. This caused the fuel cladding to fail, releasing the fuel elements into the coolant, and rupturing the channels in which these elements were located.<ref>{{cite web |language=ru |url=http://www.reactors.narod.ru/pub/chern_2/chern_2.htm |title=Chernobyl as it was |website=narod.ru |access-date=29 April 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060517063327/http://www.reactors.narod.ru/pub/chern_2/chern_2.htm |archive-date=17 May 2006 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== Steam explosions ===\n[[File:Chernobyl_rubble_and_steam_tanks_overlaid.gif|thumb|upright=1.5| The reactor lid (upper biological shield)<ref name=\"interestingengineering.com\">{{cite web|url=https://interestingengineering.com/chernobyl-a-timeline-of-the-worst-nuclear-accident-in-history |title=Chernobyl \u2013 A Timeline of The Worst Nuclear Accident in History |date=11 May 2019 |first=Marcia |last=Wendorf |work=Interesting Engineering}}</ref> nicknamed \"Elena\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/03/books/review/adam-higginbotham-midnight-in-chernobyl.html |title=Looking Again at the Chernobyl Disaster |date=3 April 2019 |first=Robert P. |last=Crease |work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> lying on its side in the explosion crater.

This explosion also compromised more of the reactor containment vessel and ejected hot lumps of graphite moderator.

According to this version, the first explosion was a more minor steam explosion in the circulating loop, causing a loss of coolant flow and pressure that in turn caused the water still in the core to flash to steam; this second explosion then caused the majority of the damage to the reactor and containment building.\n\n=== Fizzled nuclear explosion hypothesis ===\nThe force of the second explosion and the ratio of [[isotopes of xenon|xenon radioisotopes]] released after the accident (a vital tool in [[nuclear forensics]]) indicated to Yuri V. Dubasov in a 2009 publication (suggested before him by Checherov in 1998),{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} that the second explosion could have been a nuclear power transient resulting from core material melting in the absence of its water coolant and moderator. Dubasov argues that the reactor did not simply undergo a runaway delayed-supercritical exponential increase in power into the multi-gigawatt power range. That permitted a dangerous \"positive feedback\" runaway condition, given the lack of [[passive nuclear safety]] stops, such as [[Doppler broadening]], when power levels began to increase above the commercial level.<ref name= Pakhomov2009>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00024-009-0029-9 |title=Estimation of Explosion Energy Yield at Chernobyl NPP Accident |year=2009 |last1=Pakhomov |first1=Sergey A. |last2=Dubasov |first2=Yuri V. |journal=Pure and Applied Geophysics |volume=167 |issue=4\u20135 |page=575 |bibcode=2010PApGe.167..575P|doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nThe evidence for this hypothesis originates at [[Cherepovets]], Vologda Oblast, Russia, {{convert|1000|km|mi}} northeast of Chernobyl. Physicists from the [[V.G.

To do so, the molten core would now have to reach the [[water table]] below the reactor. To reduce the likelihood of this, it was decided to freeze the earth beneath the reactor, which would also stabilize the foundations. Using oil [[well drilling]] equipment, the injection of liquid nitrogen began on 4 May.

The final makeshift design for the cooling system was to incorporate a coiled formation of pipes cooled with water and covered on top with a thin thermally conductive graphite layer. The graphite layer as a natural [[refractory]] material would rapidly cool the suspected molten uranium oxide without burn through. This graphite cooling plate layer was to be encapsulated between two concrete layers, each one meter thick for stabilisation. This system was designed by Bolshov, the director of the Institute for Nuclear Safety and Development formed in 1988. Bolshov's graphite-concrete \"sandwich\" would be similar in concept to later [[core catcher]]s that are now part of many nuclear reactor designs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/catch-falling-core-lessons-chernobyl-russian-nuclear-industry|title=To Catch a Falling Core: Lessons of Chernobyl for Russian Nuclear Industry|date=18 September 2012|website=Pulitzer Center}}</ref>\n\nBolshov's graphite cooling plate, alongside the prior nitrogen injection proposal, were not used following the drop in aerial temperatures and indicative reports that the fuel melt had stopped. It was later determined that the fuel had passed through three storeys before coming to rest in one of a number of basement rooms. The precautionary underground channel with its active cooling was therefore deemed redundant, as the fuel was self-cooling. The excavation was then simply filled with concrete to strengthen the foundation below the reactor.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/23/business/energy-environment/23chernobyl.html|title=After Chernobyl, Russia's Nuclear Industry Emphasizes Reactor Safety|first=Andrew E.|last=Kramer|date=22 March 2011|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\nIt is likely that intense alpha radiation [[radiolysis|hydrolysed]] the water, generating a low-[[pH]] [[hydrogen peroxide]] (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) solution akin to an [[oxidizing acid]].<ref name=Sattonnay>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0022-3115(00)00714-5 |title=Alpha-radiolysis effects on UO2 alteration in water |year=2001 |last1=Sattonnay |first1=G. |last2=Ardois |first2=C. |last3=Corbel |first3=C. |last4=Lucchini |first4=J.

Deficiency in the safety culture was inherent not only at the operational stage (\"both the operating regulations and staff handled the disabling of the reactor protection easily enough: witness the length of time for which the emergency core cooling system was out of service while the reactor was operated at half power\"). The culture of safety was lacking also, and to no lesser extent, during activities at other stages in the lifetime of nuclear power plants (including design, engineering, construction, manufacture, and regulation). The poor quality of operating procedures and instructions, and their conflicting character, put a heavy burden on the operating crew, including the chief engineer. \"The accident can be said to have flowed from a deficient safety culture, not only at the Chernobyl plant, but throughout the Soviet design, operating and regulatory organizations for nuclear power that existed at that time.\"<ref name=\"insag7\"/>{{rp|24}}\n\n=== INSAG-1 report, 1986 ===\nThe first official explanation of the accident, later acknowledged to be erroneous, was published in August 1986. It effectively placed the blame on the power plant operators. To investigate the causes of the accident the [[IAEA]] created a group known as the [[International Nuclear Safety Group|International Nuclear Safety Advisory Group]] (INSAG), which in its report of 1986, INSAG-1, on the whole also supported this view, based on the data provided by the Soviets and the oral statements of specialists.<ref>{{cite report |url=http://www-ns.iaea.org/committees/insag.asp |title=Summary Report on the Post-Accident Review on the Chernobyl Accident |authors=IAEA Report INSAG-1 (International Nuclear Safety Advisory Group) |publisher=IAEA |location=Vienna |date=1986 |access-date=5 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091203123451/http://www-ns.iaea.org/committees/insag.asp |archivedate=3 December 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> In this view, the catastrophic accident was caused by gross violations of operating rules and regulations. \"During preparation and testing of the turbine generator under run-down conditions using the auxiliary load, personnel disconnected a series of technical protection systems and breached the most important operational safety provisions for conducting a technical exercise.\"<ref name=\"atom\"/>{{rp|311}}\n\nThe operator error was probably due to their lack of knowledge of [[nuclear reactor physics]] and [[nuclear engineering|engineering]], as well as lack of experience and training. According to these allegations, at the time of the accident the reactor was being operated with many key safety systems turned off, most notably the [[Emergency Core Cooling System]] (ECCS), LAR (Local Automatic control system), and AZ (emergency power reduction system). Personnel had an insufficient understanding of technical procedures involved with the nuclear reactor, and knowingly ignored regulations to speed test completion.<ref name=\"atom\"/>\n\n{{quote|The developers of the reactor plant considered this combination of events to be impossible and therefore did not allow for the creation of emergency protection systems capable of preventing the combination of events that led to the crisis, namely the intentional disabling of emergency protection equipment plus the violation of operating procedures.

Serious critical observations covered only general questions and did not address the specific reasons for the accident.\n\nThe following general picture arose from these observations, and several procedural irregularities also helped to make the accident possible, one of which was insufficient communication between the safety officers and the operators in charge of the experiment being run that night.\n\nThe reactor operators disabled safety systems down to the generators, which the test was really about. The main process computer, SKALA, was running in such a way that the main control computer could not shut down the reactor or even reduce power.

Based on it, in 1992 the IAEA Nuclear Safety Advisory Group (INSAG) published an additional report, INSAG-7,<ref name=insag7/> that reviewed \"that part of the INSAG-1 report in which primary attention is given to the reasons for the accident,\" and was included the USSR State Commission report as Appendix I.<ref name=insag7/>\n\nIn this INSAG report, most of the earlier accusations against staff for breach of regulations were acknowledged to be either erroneous, based on incorrect information obtained in August 1986, or less relevant. This report reflected a different view of the main reasons for the accident, presented in Appendix I. According to this account, the operators' actions in turning off the Emergency Core Cooling System, interfering with the settings on the protection equipment, and blocking the level and pressure in the separator drum did not contribute to the original cause of the accident and its magnitude, although they may have been a breach of regulations. In fact, turning off the emergency system designed to prevent the two turbine generators from stopping was not a violation of regulations.<ref name=insag7/>\n\nHuman factors, however, contributed to the conditions that led to the disaster. These included operating the reactor at a low power level\u2014less than 700&nbsp;MW\u2014a level documented in the run-down test programme, and operating with a small ORM. The 1986 assertions of Soviet experts notwithstanding, regulations did not prohibit operating the reactor at this low power level.<ref name=insag7/>{{rp|18}}\n\nHowever, regulations did forbid operating the reactor with a small margin of reactivity. Yet \"post-accident studies have shown that the way in which the real role of the ORM is reflected in the Operating Procedures and design documentation for the RBMK-1000 is extremely contradictory\", and furthermore, \"ORM was not treated as an operational safety limit, violation of which could lead to an accident\".<ref name=insag7/>{{rp|34\u201325}}\n\nAccording to the INSAG-7 Report, the chief reasons for the accident lie in the peculiarities of physics and in the construction of the reactor. There are two such reasons:<ref name=insag7/>{{rp|18}}\n# The reactor had a dangerously large positive [[void coefficient of reactivity]]. The void coefficient is a measurement of how a reactor responds to increased steam formation in the water coolant. Most other reactor designs have a negative coefficient, i.e. the nuclear reaction rate slows when steam bubbles form in the coolant, since as the vapour phase in the reactor increases, fewer [[neutrons]] are slowed down. [[Fast neutron|Faster neutrons]] are less likely to split [[uranium]] atoms, so the reactor produces less power (a negative feedback). Chernobyl's RBMK reactor, however, used solid [[nuclear graphite|graphite]] as a [[neutron moderator]] to [[thermal neutrons|slow down the neutrons]], and the water in it, on the contrary, acts like a harmful [[neutron absorber]]. Thus neutrons are slowed down even if steam bubbles form in the water. Furthermore, because steam [[neutron capture|absorbs neutrons]] much less readily than water, increasing the intensity of vapourization means that more neutrons are able to split uranium atoms, increasing the reactor's power output. This makes the RBMK design very unstable at low power levels, and prone to suddenly increasing energy production to a dangerous level. This behaviour is counter-intuitive, and this property of the reactor was unknown to the crew.\n# A more significant flaw was in the design of the [[control rods]] that are inserted into the reactor to slow down the reaction. In the RBMK reactor design, the lower part of each control rod was made of graphite and was {{convert|1.3|m|ft|||}} shorter than necessary, and in the space beneath the rods were hollow channels filled with water. The upper part of the rod, the truly functional part that absorbs the neutrons and thereby halts the reaction, was made of [[boron carbide]]. With this design, when the rods are inserted into the reactor from the uppermost position, the graphite parts initially displace some water (which absorbs neutrons, as mentioned above), effectively causing fewer neutrons to be absorbed initially. Thus for the first few seconds of control rod activation, reactor power output is increased, rather than reduced as desired. This behaviour is counter-intuitive and was not known to the reactor operators.\n\nOther deficiencies besides these were noted in the RBMK-1000 reactor design, as were its non-compliance with accepted standards and with the requirements of nuclear reactor safety. While INSAG-1 and INSAG-7 reports both identified operator error as an issue of concern, the INSAG-7 identified that there were numerous other issues that were contributing factors that led to the incident. These contributing factors include:\n# The plant was not designed to safety standards in effect and incorporated unsafe features\n# \"Inadequate safety analysis\" was performed<ref name=insag7/>\n# There was \"insufficient attention to independent safety review\"<ref name=insag7/>\n# \"Operating procedures not founded satisfactorily in safety analysis\"<ref name=insag7/>\n# Safety information not adequately and effectively communicated between operators, and between operators and designers\n# The operators did not adequately understand safety aspects of the plant\n# Operators did not sufficiently respect formal requirements of operational and test procedures\n# The regulatory regime was insufficient to effectively counter pressures for production\n# There was a \"general lack of safety culture in nuclear matters at the national level as well as locally\"<ref name=insag7/>\n\n== Impact ==\n\n=== Environmental ===\n\n==== Spread of radioactive substances ====\n{{Main|Effects of the Chernobyl disaster}}\nAlthough no informing comparisons can be made between the accident and a strictly [[air burst]]-fuzed nuclear detonation, it has still been approximated that about four hundred times more radioactive material was released from Chernobyl than by the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]. By contrast the Chernobyl accident released about one hundredth to one thousandth of the total amount of radioactivity released during the era of [[nuclear weapons testing]] at the height of the Cold War, 1950\u20131960s, with the 1/100 to 1/1000 variance due to trying to make comparisons with different spectrums of isotopes released.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Booklets/Chernoten/facts.html |title=Facts: The accident was by far the most devastating in the history of nuclear power |website=International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) |date=21 September 1997 |accessdate=20 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805035908/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Booklets/Chernoten/facts.html |archivedate=5 August 2011 }}</ref> Approximately {{convert|100,000|km2|sqmi}} of land was significantly contaminated with fallout, with the worst hit regions being in Belarus, Ukraine and Russia.<ref name=\"MarplesDecade\">{{cite journal |last=Marples |first=David R. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xAwAAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA20&pg=PA20#v=onepage |title=The Decade of Despair |journal=The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |date=May\u2013June 1996 |volume=52 |pages=20\u201331 |issue=3 |doi=10.1080/00963402.1996.11456623 |bibcode=1996BuAtS..52c..20M |access-date=25 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427033605/https://books.google.com/books?id=xAwAAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA20&pg=PA20#v=onepage |archive-date=27 April 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Slighter levels of contamination were detected over all of Europe except for the [[Iberian Peninsula]].<ref name=torch/><ref name=\"RFI 24\">{{Cite news |language=fr |title=Tchernobyl, 20 ans apr\u00e8s |website=[[Radio France Internationale|RFI]] |date=24 April 2006 |accessdate=24 April 2006 |url=http://www.rfi.fr/actufr/articles/076/article_43250.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060430063029/http://www.rfi.fr/actufr/articles/076/article_43250.asp |archive-date=30 April 2006 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |language=fr |title=L'accident et ses cons\u00e9quences: Le panache radioactif |trans-title=The accident and its consequences: The plume |website=Institut de Radioprotection et de S\u00fbret\u00e9 Nucl\u00e9aire (IRSN) |accessdate=16 December 2006 |url=http://www.irsn.fr/FR/popup/Pages/tchernobyl_animation_nuage.aspx}}</ref>\n\nThe initial evidence that a major release of radioactive material was affecting other countries came not from Soviet sources, but from Sweden.

In the winter of 1993/1994, Condor's parent company, Commodore Shipping, took over [[British Channel Island Ferries]] (BCIF) which operated conventional ferry services to the [[Channel Islands]] from [[Poole]]. Upon taking over BCIF, Condor moved all passenger services to [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]] and the BCIF freight service was transferred to Commodore Shipping. The BCIF vessel ''Havelet'' ran a conventional ferry service from Weymouth from 1994 alongside the ''Condor 10''.\n\n=== New UK bases, purchase of the ''Havelet'' and ''Condor Vitesse'' ===\n\nIn March 1997, Condor moved its [[United Kingdom|UK]] port to [[Poole]]. The ''Condor Express'' suffered technical problems that led to late-running services. As a result, the Channel Island governments put the licence to operate ferry services to the UK out to tender. [[P&O European Ferries]] and [[Hoverspeed]] submitted bids to run the service but ultimately Condor retained the licence but was forced to purchase the ''Havelet'' to act as an all-weather back-up until the delivery of a new conventional vessel in 1999.  It also purchased the ''Condor Vitesse'' for a new service to [[St Malo]] via [[Guernsey]] and made Weymouth its primary UK port, though retaining summer sailings from Poole. Commodore Shipping became sole owner of the company around this time.\n\nAs part of the ''Condor Liberation'' purchase, the ''Condor Vitesse'' has been sold to a Greek ferry company, along with her sister ''Condor Express''.\n\n=== Introduction of ''Condor 10'', management buy-out, rebranding and sale ===\n\n''Condor 10'' returned to the fleet in March 2002 to replace the Condor 9 on the St Malo - Channel Island service and to fully compete with the existing fast car ferry service of [[Emeraude Ferries|Emeraude Lines]].  Later that year, the Commodore Group, which included Condor Ferries, Commodore Ferries and Commodore Express, was sold to a management buy-out team for a reported \u00a3150 million. The deal was backed by [[ABN AMRO]]. Shortly after, the Condor Ferries logo was redesigned for the start of the 2003 season using the same font as the logo [[Brittany Ferries]] had adopted in 2002. In 2004, the group was rebranded with Commodore Ferries coming under the Condor Ferries name and Commodore Express becoming Condor Logistics. The group was sold once again in 2004 to the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]]'s venture capital arm for \u00a3240 million.\n\n=== Acquisition by the Macquarie Group ===\n\nIn 2008, with the approval of the Jersey Competition Regulatory Authority, the Macquarie European Infrastructure Fund II acquired Admiral Holdings Ltd, which owns the Condor Group.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/guernsey/7540696.stm | work=BBC News | title=Condor is sold to investment fund | date=4 August 2008}}</ref>\n\n=== Closure of Condor Logistics ===\n\nIt was announced on 4 October 2012 that Condor Logistics would close its operations with the loss of about 180 jobs (110 in the UK, 50 in Jersey and 20 in Guernsey). The move was blamed on changes to [[low-value consignment relief]] affecting the Channel Islands.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.condorferries.co.uk/Documents/12_10_04%20CGannouncementLVCRImpact_Jerseyfinal.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6NPRhYCQd?url=http://www.condorferries.co.uk/Documents/12_10_04%20CGannouncementLVCRImpact_Jerseyfinal.pdf |archivedate=15 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Operations==\nCondor Ferries operate the following routes:\n*[[Poole]] - Guernsey - Jersey (service previously operated by ''Condor Express'') - operated from 27 March 2015, with the HSC Condor Liberation\n*[[Portsmouth]] - Guernsey - Jersey (''Commodore Clipper'', ''Commodore Goodwill'')\n*Portsmouth - [[Cherbourg]] (seasonal service operated by ''Commodore Clipper'' and primarily aimed at the caravan market){{fact|date=June 2018}}\n*Jersey and Guernsey - St Malo (''Condor Rapide'')\n\n==Current fleet==\nThe fleet is as follows.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The new ''Commodore Clipper'' was able to replace ''Havelet'' as all-weather back-up for the fast craft as she had space for 500 passengers.\n[[File:poole.harbour.condor.arp.jpg|thumb|right|The outbound Condor ferry passes through [[Poole Harbour]], [[Dorset]], [[England]], in 2002]]\n\n=== ''Condor Rapide'' ===\n{{main|HSC Condor Rapide}}\nIn May 2010, ''Condor Rapide'', Incat Hull 045, IMO9161560, was added to the fleet to replace ''Condor 10''.

The speed had progressively reached 37 knots. In the wheelhouse almost continuous talks without any link with the watchkeeping, maintained an atmosphere not compatible with the necessary concentration to conduct a HSC in the fog. This behavior, as well as the visibility are the causal factors of the accident. When Condor Vitesse approached the Minquiers waters, both officers did not detect 2 vessel echoes ahead on starboard, the first was a ship that would be passing at a hundred of meters on starboard, the second was Les Marquises. The potter was fishing, with her radar on, without emitting any sound signals. A hand saw the HSC at the last moment but too late to alert the skipper. The collision cut the fishing vessel in two parts, while on board the HSC there was a leak in the starboard bow compartment. The aft part of the potter kept afloat for a time, allowing the two hands to stay on it until they have been rescued by the HSC crew.\"''<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.channelonline.tv/channelonline_jerseynews/DisplayArticle.asp?ID=496579|publisher=Channel Television|title=Damning report released on Condor ferry crash|accessdate=19 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405080513/http://www.channelonline.tv/channelonline_jerseynews/DisplayArticle.asp?ID=496579|archive-date=5 April 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn 11 September 2013 the court in Coutances found the Vitesse captain Paul Le Romancer and first officer Yves Tournon (both of whom no longer work for Condor) guilty of [[manslaughter]], involuntary injury and failure to respect [[International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea|maritime regulations]].<ref>http://www.channelonline.tv/channelonline/DisplayArticle.asp?ID=507153{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Tournon was later exonerated by the Caen appeal court, which quashed his conviction.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://jerseyeveningpost.com/news/2015/02/03/french-court-upholds-sentence-for-condor-captain/ | title=French court upholds sentence for Condor captain | publisher=Jersey Evening Post | work=Jersey Evening Post | date=3 February 2015 | accessdate=15 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Commodore Clipper'' grounding ===\n[[File:Ships in Portsmouth 18 - Commodore Clipper.jpg|thumb|right|The Commodore Clipper]]\nOn 14 July 2014, ''Commodore Clipper'' accidentally grounded off Guernsey.

The planning issues not properly considered were: the very low tide, the effect of the ship \u2018squatting\u2019 in shallow water at high speed and the accuracy of the chart data. \n* The possibility that the vessel had grounded was denied. In the circumstances of a shuddering vibration, it is important that the crew establish the state of their vessel by searching for damage. \n* The repetitive nature of ferry operations can induce a degree of complacency when planning. \n* The electronic navigation system was not being utilised effectively because safety settings were not appropriate to the local conditions, warnings were ignored and the audible alarm was disabled. \n* As the responsible authority, Guernsey Harbours did not have an effective risk assessment or safety management plan for the conduct of navigation in its statutory pilotage area.\n\nCondor Ferries says it entirely accepts the findings of its detailed and thorough report.\n\n=== ''Condor Liberation'' berthing collision ===\nOn Saturday 28 March 2015, the day after ''Condor Liberation'' entered service, she was blown onto the quayside in Guernsey and had to be taken out of service and returned to Poole for repairs.

In the winter of 1993/1994, Condor's parent company, Commodore Shipping, took over [[British Channel Island Ferries]] (BCIF) which operated conventional ferry services to the [[Channel Islands]] from [[Poole]]. Upon taking over BCIF, Condor moved all passenger services to [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]] and the BCIF freight service was transferred to Commodore Shipping. The BCIF vessel ''Havelet'' ran a conventional ferry service from Weymouth from 1994 alongside the ''Condor 10''.\n\n=== New UK bases, purchase of the ''Havelet'' and ''Condor Vitesse'' ===\n\nIn March 1997, Condor moved its [[United Kingdom|UK]] port to [[Poole]]. The ''Condor Express'' suffered technical problems that led to late-running services. As a result, the Channel Island governments put the licence to operate ferry services to the UK out to tender. [[P&O European Ferries]] and [[Hoverspeed]] submitted bids to run the service but ultimately Condor retained the licence but was forced to purchase the ''Havelet'' to act as an all-weather back-up until the delivery of a new conventional vessel in 1999.  It also purchased the ''Condor Vitesse'' for a new service to [[St Malo]] via [[Guernsey]] and made Weymouth its primary UK port, though retaining summer sailings from Poole. Commodore Shipping became sole owner of the company around this time.\n\nAs part of the ''Condor Liberation'' purchase, the ''Condor Vitesse'' has been sold to a Greek ferry company, along with her sister ''Condor Express''.\n\n=== Introduction of ''Condor 10'', management buy-out, rebranding and sale ===\n\n''Condor 10'' returned to the fleet in March 2002 to replace the Condor 9 on the St Malo - Channel Island service and to fully compete with the existing fast car ferry service of [[Emeraude Ferries|Emeraude Lines]].  Later that year, the Commodore Group, which included Condor Ferries, Commodore Ferries and Commodore Express, was sold to a management buy-out team for a reported \u00a3150 million. The deal was backed by [[ABN AMRO]]. Shortly after, the Condor Ferries logo was redesigned for the start of the 2003 season using the same font as the logo [[Brittany Ferries]] had adopted in 2002. In 2004, the group was rebranded with Commodore Ferries coming under the Condor Ferries name and Commodore Express becoming Condor Logistics. The group was sold once again in 2004 to the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]]'s venture capital arm for \u00a3240 million.\n\n=== Acquisition by the Macquarie Group ===\n\nIn 2008, with the approval of the Jersey Competition Regulatory Authority, the Macquarie European Infrastructure Fund II acquired Admiral Holdings Ltd, which owns the Condor Group.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/guernsey/7540696.stm | work=BBC News | title=Condor is sold to investment fund | date=4 August 2008}}</ref>\n\n=== Closure of Condor Logistics ===\n\nIt was announced on 4 October 2012 that Condor Logistics would close its operations with the loss of about 180 jobs (110 in the UK, 50 in Jersey and 20 in Guernsey). The move was blamed on changes to [[low-value consignment relief]] affecting the Channel Islands.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.condorferries.co.uk/Documents/12_10_04%20CGannouncementLVCRImpact_Jerseyfinal.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6NPRhYCQd?url=http://www.condorferries.co.uk/Documents/12_10_04%20CGannouncementLVCRImpact_Jerseyfinal.pdf |archivedate=15 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Operations==\nCondor Ferries operate the following routes:\n*[[Poole]] - Guernsey - Jersey (service previously operated by ''Condor Express'') - operated from 27 March 2015, with the HSC Condor Liberation\n*[[Portsmouth]] - Guernsey - Jersey (''Commodore Clipper'', ''Commodore Goodwill'')\n*Portsmouth - [[Cherbourg]] (seasonal service operated by ''Commodore Clipper'' and primarily aimed at the caravan market){{fact|date=June 2018}}\n*Jersey and Guernsey - St Malo (''Condor Rapide'')\n\n==Current fleet==\nThe fleet is as follows.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The speed had progressively reached 37 knots. In the wheelhouse almost continuous talks without any link with the watchkeeping, maintained an atmosphere not compatible with the necessary concentration to conduct a HSC in the fog. This behavior, as well as the visibility are the causal factors of the accident. When Condor Vitesse approached the Minquiers waters, both officers did not detect 2 vessel echoes ahead on starboard, the first was a ship that would be passing at a hundred of meters on starboard, the second was Les Marquises. The potter was fishing, with her radar on, without emitting any sound signals. A hand saw the HSC at the last moment but too late to alert the skipper. The collision cut the fishing vessel in two parts, while on board the HSC there was a leak in the starboard bow compartment. The aft part of the potter kept afloat for a time, allowing the two hands to stay on it until they have been rescued by the HSC crew.\"''<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.channelonline.tv/channelonline_jerseynews/DisplayArticle.asp?ID=496579|publisher=Channel Television|title=Damning report released on Condor ferry crash|accessdate=19 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405080513/http://www.channelonline.tv/channelonline_jerseynews/DisplayArticle.asp?ID=496579|archive-date=5 April 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn 11 September 2013 the court in Coutances found the Vitesse captain Paul Le Romancer and first officer Yves Tournon (both of whom no longer work for Condor) guilty of [[manslaughter]], involuntary injury and failure to respect [[International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea|maritime regulations]].<ref>http://www.channelonline.tv/channelonline/DisplayArticle.asp?ID=507153{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Tournon was later exonerated by the Caen appeal court, which quashed his conviction.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://jerseyeveningpost.com/news/2015/02/03/french-court-upholds-sentence-for-condor-captain/ | title=French court upholds sentence for Condor captain | publisher=Jersey Evening Post | work=Jersey Evening Post | date=3 February 2015 | accessdate=15 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Commodore Clipper'' grounding ===\n[[File:Ships in Portsmouth 18 - Commodore Clipper.jpg|thumb|right|The Commodore Clipper]]\nOn 14 July 2014, ''Commodore Clipper'' accidentally grounded off Guernsey.

The planning issues not properly considered were: the very low tide, the effect of the ship \u2018squatting\u2019 in shallow water at high speed and the accuracy of the chart data. \n* The possibility that the vessel had grounded was denied. In the circumstances of a shuddering vibration, it is important that the crew establish the state of their vessel by searching for damage. \n* The repetitive nature of ferry operations can induce a degree of complacency when planning. \n* The electronic navigation system was not being utilised effectively because safety settings were not appropriate to the local conditions, warnings were ignored and the audible alarm was disabled. \n* As the responsible authority, Guernsey Harbours did not have an effective risk assessment or safety management plan for the conduct of navigation in its statutory pilotage area.\n\nCondor Ferries says it entirely accepts the findings of its detailed and thorough report.\n\n=== ''Condor Liberation'' berthing collision ===\nOn Saturday 28 March 2015, the day after ''Condor Liberation'' entered service, she was blown onto the quayside in Guernsey and had to be taken out of service and returned to Poole for repairs.

{"title_page": "Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege", "text_new": "{{short description|Online tactical shooter video game by Ubisoft}}{{good article}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=May 2019}}\n\n'''''Ali shammaa\u2019s Rainbow Six Siege''''' is an [[Online game|online]] [[tactical shooter]] [[video game]] developed by [[Ubisoft Montreal]] and published by [[Ubisoft]]. It was released worldwide for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]] on December 1, 2015. It was also set to be released for [[PlayStation 5]] and [[Xbox Series X]]. The game puts heavy emphasis on environmental destruction and cooperation between players. Each player assumes control of an attacker or a defender in different gameplay modes such as rescuing a hostage, defusing a bomb, and taking control of an objective within a room. The title has no campaign but features a series of short, offline missions called, \"situations\" that can be played solo. These missions have a loose narrative, focusing on recruits going through training to prepare them for future encounters with the \"White Masks\", a terrorist group that threatens the safety of the world. \n\nIt is an entry in the ''[[Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six]]'' series and the successor to ''[[Tom Clancy's Rainbow 6: Patriots]]'', a tactical shooter that had a larger focus on narrative. However, ''Patriots'' was eventually cancelled due to its technical shortcomings, and the team decided to reboot the franchise. The team evaluated the core of the ''Rainbow Six'' franchise and believed that letting players impersonate the top counter-terrorist operatives around the world suited the game most. To create authentic siege situations, the team consulted actual [[counter-terrorism unit]]s and looked at real-life examples of sieges such as the Iranian Embassy siege. Powered by [[Anvil (game engine)|AnvilNext 2.0]], the game also utilizes Ubisoft's RealBlast technology to create destructible environments.\n\nAnnounced at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014]], it received four nominations from [[Game Critics Awards]] including Best of Show. The game received an overall positive reception from critics, with praise mostly directed to the game's tense multiplayer and focus on tactics. However, the game was criticized for its progression system and its lack of content. Initial sales were weak, but the game's player base increased significantly as Ubisoft adopted a \"[[games as a service]]\" model for the game and subsequently released several packages of free [[downloadable content]]. Several years after the game's release, some critics regarded ''Siege'' as one of the best multiplayer games in the modern market due to the improvements brought by the post-launch updates. The company partnered with [[ESL (eSports)|ESL]] to make ''Siege'' an [[esports]] game. In February 2019, the game surpassed 45 million registered players across all platforms.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/rainbow-six-siege/rainbow-six-siege-player-count|title=Rainbow Six Siege player count tops 40 million|last=Bailey|first=Dustin|date=October 30, 2018|work=PCgamesn|access-date=November 10, 2018|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181104131428/https://www.pcgamesn.com/rainbow-six-siege/rainbow-six-siege-player-count|archive-date=November 4, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|An alpha gameplay screenshot of the game, showcasing the Hostage Mode.

Players also have access to a \"Recruit\" operator who can choose from a more flexible assortment of equipment at the expense of having a unique gadget or the ability to customize their weapon. Players can pick any operator from any unit that is defending or attacking before a round starts, choosing spawn points as well attachments on their guns but are not allowed to change their choices once the round has started. An in-game shop allows players to purchase operators or cosmetics using the in-game currency, \"Renown\", which is earned at the end of matches from actions performed in-game. Different gameplay modes award renown at different rates, with ranked matches offering the largest renown multiplier potential per match. Players can also complete in-game \"challenges\" to get a small amount of renown. Renown gain rate can also be affected by the using in-game \"boosters\" which gives the player a 100% increase in all renown earned for various duration, starting with 24 hours.

The team also consulted [[counter-terrorism unit]]s, such as the [[National Gendarmerie Intervention Group]] (GIGN), for their opinions on how they would react during a hostage rescue situation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2014/10/21/7033719/how-rainbow-six-siege-takes-inspiration-from-real-life-hostage-rescues|title=How Rainbow Six: Siege takes inspiration from real life hostage rescues|first=Colin|last=Campbell|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=October 21, 2014|accessdate=June 14, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171209100008/https://www.polygon.com/2014/10/21/7033719/how-rainbow-six-siege-takes-inspiration-from-real-life-hostage-rescues|archive-date=December 9, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> According to Xavier Marquis, the game's creative director, having a hostage rescue mission in the game helped create an immersive story. By allowing players to assume control of an operator tasked with saving innocents, it gives them an objective and a priority. They must be careful in dealing with the situation and try their best not to hurt the hostage. This further promotes teamwork between players and prompts them to plan before attacking, and further makes the game more realistic, tense and immersive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/21/how-real-life-events-influenced-rainbow-six-siege|title=How Real-Life Events Influenced Rainbow Six Siege|first=Cassidee|last=Moser|work=[[IGN]]|date=October 21, 2014|accessdate=June 14, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170607044652/http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/21/how-real-life-events-influenced-rainbow-six-siege|archive-date=June 7, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> To make the game feel more realistic, the team introduced a mechanic called \"living hostage\" to govern the hostage character's behaviour \u2013 e.g., coughing if there is dust in the air or shielding him or herself if there is nearby gunfire.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/06/26/rainbow-six-siege-to-include-male-hostages-too/|title=Rainbow Six: Siege to include male hostages, too|first=Jessica|last=Conditt|work=[[Engadget]]|date=June 26, 2014|accessdate=June 15, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171209044110/https://www.engadget.com/2014/06/26/rainbow-six-siege-to-include-male-hostages-too/|archive-date=December 9, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe environmental destruction mechanic was one of the game's most important elements. When the game's development was begun, the developer's in-house team completed their work on RealBlast Destruction, an engine that \"procedurally breaks everything down\" and remodels the environment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.ubi.com/the-art-of-destruction-in-rainbow-six-siege-an-interview-with-julien-lheureux/|title=The Art of Destruction In Rainbow Six - An Interview With Julien L'Heureux|publisher=[[Ubisoft]]|work=UbiBlog|date=March 11, 2016|accessdate=June 14, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809131938/http://blog.ubi.com/the-art-of-destruction-in-rainbow-six-siege-an-interview-with-julien-lheureux/|archivedate=August 9, 2017}}</ref> The development team thought that this technology fitted the game's style and gameplay, and decided to use it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/rainbow-six-siege-interview-finding-meaning-in-destruction|title=Rainbow Six Siege Interview: Finding Meaning in Destruction|first=Mike|last=Williams|work=[[USgamer]]|date=October 7, 2015|accessdate=June 15, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510071131/http://www.usgamer.net/articles/rainbow-six-siege-interview-finding-meaning-in-destruction|archive-date=May 10, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> This aspect of the game became increasingly important during development, and the team spent an extended period of time making sure that these destructions were authentic. As a result, the team implemented a materials-based tearing system, in which environmental objects of different materials show different reactions to players' attacks.<ref name=\"PCG1\"/> To render the game's texture, the team used [[physically based rendering]], even though it was ineffective during the game's early stage of production due to issues with the game's engine. A material bank and substance painter were utilized to create textures for environmental objects when they were damaged or destroyed. The team also implemented subtle visual cues to help players identify whether a structure was destructible or not, as opposed to \"distracting\" players with more-obvious hints.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.develop-online.net/interview/breaking-down-the-right-walls-ubisoft-montreal-on-texturing-rainbow-six-siege-s-destructible-world/0219230|title=Breaking down the (right) walls: Ubisoft Montreal on texturing Rainbow Six Siege's destructible world|first=Matthew|last=Jarvis|work=[[Develop (magazine)|Develop]]|date=April 15, 2016|accessdate=June 15, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810083236/http://www.develop-online.net/interview/breaking-down-the-right-walls-ubisoft-montreal-on-texturing-rainbow-six-siege-s-destructible-world/0219230|archive-date=August 10, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The destruction mechanic prompted Ubisoft to change their level-design approach, as they had to ensure that the level was still logical and realistic when parts of the environment were destroyed.<ref name=\"postmortem\">{{cite web|url=http://www.develop-online.net/analysis/the-develop-post-mortem-rainbow-six-siege/0233146|title=The Develop Post-Mortem: Rainbow Six Siege|work=[[Develop (magazine)|Develop]]|date=May 31, 2017|accessdate=June 15, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170605062500/http://www.develop-online.net/analysis/the-develop-post-mortem-rainbow-six-siege/0233146|archive-date=June 5, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Ubisoft, \"teamwork, tactics, and tension\" were the game's three most important pillars. The team initially worked on a respawn feature, allowing players to rejoin after they are killed in the game. However, following several internal tournaments, the team realized that some of their employees would always win a match. They concluded that the respawn system worked to the benefit of strong players and placed individual skill above teamwork,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/ubisoft-explains-why-you-wont-respawn-in-rainbow-six-siege/|title=Ubisoft explains why you won't respawn in Rainbow Six Siege|first=Andy|last=Chalk|work=[[PC Gamer]]|date=October 14, 2015|accessdate=June 15, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809170956/http://www.pcgamer.com/ubisoft-explains-why-you-wont-respawn-in-rainbow-six-siege/|archive-date=August 9, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> which did not fit the developer's focus on game tactics. Removing the respawn feature meant greater consequences for taking risks, and players had to rely on their teammates in order to survive and achieve objectives. According to Chris Lee, the game's designer, the team initially worried that the system would only appeal to hardcore players. However, after several testings, they found that the removal of the respawn system provided new challenges to strong players and forced them to cooperate with their teammates \u2013 while it rewarded weaker players who were willing to take their time, plan their actions, and be strategic.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-rainbow-six-siege-doesnt-let-you-respawn/1100-6422962/|title=Why Rainbow Six Siege Doesn't Let You Respawn|first=Eddie|last=Makuch|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=October 14, 2015|accessdate=June 15, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809131650/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-rainbow-six-siege-doesnt-let-you-respawn/1100-6422962/|archive-date=August 9, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"FP\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/inside-rainbow-six-sieges-development|title=Inside Rainbow Six: Siege's Development|first=Jaz|last=Rignall|work=[[USgamer]]|date=November 22, 2015|accessdate=June 6, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809170953/http://www.usgamer.net/articles/inside-rainbow-six-sieges-development|archive-date=August 9, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe gameplay system was designed to allow players to have a lot of freedom. As a result, the team implemented the \"Golden 3C Rules\", which represents Character, Control, and Camera.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/rainbow-six-siege-video-promises-complete-player-control/|title=Rainbow Six Siege video promises complete player control|first=Shaun|last=Prescott|work=[[PC Gamer]]|date=December 5, 2014|accessdate=June 15, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151218125902/http://www.pcgamer.com/rainbow-six-siege-video-promises-complete-player-control/|archive-date=December 18, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Players are always controlling their own actions and movements, and the team intentionally avoided any animation that would disrupt the players. As a result, actions such as setting explosives, or placing a breach charge, can be cancelled immediately so that players can react and shoot. The game's camera only moves when the player moves, as the team feared that the changes of camera angle may lead to players' in-game deaths. A free-lean system was introduced to the game so that players can have more control over their line of sight.<ref name=\"lean\"/> According to Ubisoft, this input-driven control mechanism makes the game feel more \"natural\" and \"fluid\". This is because it allows players to concentrate on planning and coordinating, rather than thinking if the camera or environment will interfere with their actions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/news/detail.aspx?c=tcm:152-187149-16&ct=tcm:148-76770-32|title=Behind The Wall: Cover and Lean|first=Chase|last=Straight|work=UbiBlog|publisher=[[Ubisoft]]|date=December 2, 2014|accessdate=June 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\nSeveral gameplay elements were scrapped or removed from the final game. One of the features of its predecessors, [[artificial intelligence]]-controlled squadmates, were removed from single-player missions. This decision was made because the team wanted players to play with a squad controlled by actual players rather than computers. The team once considered adding a map editor so that players could design their own maps, but this plan never came to fruition. Hit markers, which would indicate an injury inflicted on an opponent, were removed because the team feared that players would abuse the system by \"peppering the walls with gunfire\" and use hit markers to locate enemies. Players cannot jump in the game, as real-life counter-terrorist unit operators do not jump while carrying out their missions.<ref name=\"FP\">{{cite web|url=http://business.financialpost.com/technology/gaming/developer-interview-we-ask-what-rainbow-six-siege-brings-to-the-table-after-eight-years-away|title=Developer interview: We ask what Rainbow Six Siege brings to the table after eight years away|first=Chad|last=Sapihea|work=Post Arcade|publisher=[[Financial Post]]|date=November 25, 2015|accessdate=June 15, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190228073013/https://business.financialpost.com/technology/gaming/developer-interview-we-ask-what-rainbow-six-siege-brings-to-the-table-after-eight-years-away|archive-date=February 28, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Louis Philippe, the game's audio director, the team originally used intense music and sounds to create tension. However, the team decided to scrap this idea, realizing that the best way to create a tense atmosphere is to create the sounds of other players, which are often unexpected. The team created Navigation Sounds, in which the sound a player made is determined by their operators' weight, armour, and speed. Gadget deployment such as fortifying and breach-charging create louder sounds that may reveal the player's presence. The team thought that this would be enjoyable for players and influence their gameplay experience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/288565/Game_Design_Deep_Dive_Dynamic_audio_in_destructible_levels_in_Rainbow_Six_Siege.php|title=Game Design Deep Dive: Dynamic audio in destructible levels in Rainbow Six: Siege|first=Louis|last=Philippe Dion|work=[[Gamasutra]]|date=January 18, 2017|accessdate=June 16, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170613040057/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/288565/Game_Design_Deep_Dive_Dynamic_audio_in_destructible_levels_in_Rainbow_Six_Siege.php|archive-date=June 13, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The game's music was composed by [[Paul Haslinger]], who had worked on the score of the previous ''Rainbow Six'' games and the ''[[Far Cry]]'' series.

Critics generally praised the game's destructive environment, tactical nature, map design, and its focus on teamwork. However, the lack of content and the game's microtransactions were subjected to criticism.\n\nThe game's multiplayer was widely praised by critics. Chris Carter from ''[[Destructoid]]'' praised the game's open-ended nature, which made each match unpredictable and helped the experience to stay fresh even after an extended period of playing.<ref name=\"DestructRev\"/> [[GameSpot]]'s Scott Butterworth appreciated the title for allowing players to make use of their creativity in approaching a mission.<ref name=\"GSpotRev\"/> James Davenport from ''[[PC Gamer]]'' echoed this thought, and he described ''Siege'' as a \"psychological race\" in which players are constantly trying to outwit their opponents.<ref name=\"PCGRev\"/> Ryan McCaffery from [[IGN]] also praised the tactical possibilities, which make the game \"tense and riveting\".<ref name=\"IGNRev\"/> The large number of operators available for players to choose were praised by both Carter and Matt Bertz from ''[[Game Informer]]'', who commented that they added depths and variety to the game and that players could experiment to see which pairs of operators can complement each other.<ref name=\"GIRev\"/> However, McCaffery was disappointed by the lack of variety of game modes and commented that most players usually neglect the mode's objectives and opted to simply eliminate their opponents.<ref name=\"IGNRev\"/> Terrorist Hunt received divisive opinions from critics. Carter thought that it was more relaxing,<ref name=\"DestructRev\"/> and Butterworth thought it was exhilarating. However, Bertz criticized its lack of variety, weak [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]], and its less-intense nature when compared with the player-versus-player modes.<ref name=\"GIRev\"/> Martin Robinson from [[Eurogamer]] also noted that the mode only ran at 30 [[frames per second]], which limited its appeal.<ref name=\"EuroGRev\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-12-03-rainbow-six-siege-review|title=Rainbow Six Siege review: Six Pack|first=Martin|last=Robinson|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=December 3, 2015|accessdate=June 16, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808040913/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-12-03-rainbow-six-siege-review|archive-date=August 8, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe game's focus on tactics was praised. Bertz applauded the tactical nature of the game, as it fostered communications between players. However, he noted that teamwork may not be possible if players did not have a headphone and microphone.<ref name=\"GIRev\"/> Arthur Gies from ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' echoed these comments, stating that the game's over-reliance on teamwork meant that when teammates were not communicating, the game would not be fun to play.<ref name=\"PolyRev\"/> The \"No Respawn\" system was praised by Butterworth for making each match feel intense, as even the best player needs to think tactically in order to win.<ref name=\"GSpotRev\"/> Jonathon Leack from [[Game Revolution]] enjoyed the scouting phase of a multiplayer match, which encouraged players to communicate with each other and coordinate their attacks.<ref name=\"GameRevRev\"/> However, Gies noted that the placement of game objectives does not vary much, thus making the scouting phase meaningless. Both Bertz and Butterworth agreed that the game's competitive nature increases the game's replay value.<ref name=\"GIRev\"/><ref name=\"GSpotRev\"/> Ben Griffin from [[GamesRadar]] praised the destruction mechanic for bringing tactical depth to the game.<ref name=\"GRadarRev\"/>\n\nThe gameplay received mixed reviews. Both Bertz and Griffin criticized the game's incompetent hit detection system, which made the experience unfair.<ref name=\"GRadarRev\"/> Bertz described the game's gunplay as \"serviceable\",<ref name=\"GIRev\"/> while Leack noticed a delay in shooting, which drags the game's pace and leads to a steep learning curve. However, Leack appreciated the game's map design, which opened many possibilities. He also praised its attention to detail and sound design, which can often make a multiplayer match feel like a \"great action film\".<ref name=\"GameRevRev\"/> Bertz was disappointed by the lack of customization options, which did not offer long-term progression for the players.<ref name=\"GIRev\"/> Butterworth similarly criticized the progression system for being slow. As players cannot play as the same operator in the same match, he was often forced to play as the generic \"recruit\" character when he was only at the beginning stage of the game. He also criticized the limited weapon customization options, which barely affect gameplay.<ref name=\"GSpotRev\"/> McCaffery described customization as the \"least interesting\" aspect of the game and claimed that most gameplay features were locked when players started playing.<ref name=\"IGNRev\"/> Griffin, Gies, and Steven Burns from ''VideoGamer.com'' were annoyed by the [[microtransaction]]s featured in the game,<ref name=\"VGRev\"/><ref name=\"PolyRev\"/> with Griffin describing it as a greedy attempt by Ubisoft to make more money,<ref name=\"GRadarRev\"/> though Davenport did not mind these features as they were limited to cosmetic items and could be unlocked through earning Renown.<ref name=\"PCGRev\"/> Bertz was annoyed the lack of clan infrastructure, which may cause players troubles when they were finding matches,<ref name=\"GIRev\"/> while Griffin thought that map rotation often felt random and was disappointed that players cannot vote to decide which map they are going to play next.<ref name=\"GRadarRev\"/>\n\nSingle-player was generally considered a disappointment by critics, with Situations receiving mixed reviews. Carter described it as one of his \"favorite non-campaign additions\" as the mode gave players incentive to return due to its rating system.

However, the announcement generated opposition from the gaming community who believed the changes were going to be made for the game's upcoming release in China, likening the move to [[Video game censorship|censorship]].<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Parlock |first1=Joe |title='Rainbow Six Siege' In Censorship Row As \"Aesthetic Changes\" Are Made To Fit Asian Regulations |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/joeparlock/2018/11/02/rainbow-six-siege-in-censorship-row-as-aesthetic-changes-are-made-to-fit-asian-regulations/ |magazine=Forbes |accessdate=November 28, 2018 |date=November 2, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190524191344/https://www.forbes.com/sites/joeparlock/2018/11/02/rainbow-six-siege-in-censorship-row-as-aesthetic-changes-are-made-to-fit-asian-regulations/ |archive-date=May 24, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Because of pressure from the community, Ubisoft Montreal announced on November 21 that they were reversing the decision to make the changes, \"We have been following the conversation with our community closely over the past couple of weeks, alongside regular discussions with our internal Ubisoft team, and we want to ensure that the experience for all our players, especially those that have been with us from the beginning, remains as true to the original artistic intent as possible.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hall |first1=Charlie |title=Rainbow Six Siege team reverses course, will not censor the game for global players |url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/11/21/18106429/rainbow-six-siege-removes-censorship-china |website=Polygon |accessdate=November 28, 2018 |date=November 21, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190517024033/https://www.polygon.com/2018/11/21/18106429/rainbow-six-siege-removes-censorship-china |archive-date=May 17, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://rainbow6.ubi.com/}}\n\n{{Tom Clancy games}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rainbow Six Siege, Tom Clancy's}}\n[[Category:2015 video games]]\n[[Category:Asymmetrical multiplayer video games]]\n[[Category:Cooperative video games]]\n[[Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation 4 games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation 5 games]]\n[[Category:Hero shooters]]\n[[Category:Tactical shooter video games]]\n[[Category:Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six]]\n[[Category:Tom Clancy games]]\n[[Category:Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six games]]\n[[Category:Ubisoft games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in Canada]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Boston]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Canada]]\n[[Category:Video games set in France]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Germany]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Hong Kong]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Japan]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Morocco]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Moscow]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Oregon]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Russia]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Seoul]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Spain]]\n[[Category:Video games set in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Video games set in the United States]]\n[[Category:Video games using Havok]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Xbox One games]]\n[[Category:Xbox (4th generation) games]]\n[[Category:Video games about terrorism]]\n[[Category:Video games set in the 2010s]]\n[[Category:Video games set in the 2020s]]\n[[Category:Video games containing battle passes]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Online tactical shooter video game by Ubisoft}}{{good article}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=May 2019}}\n{{Infobox video game\n| title = Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege\n| image = Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege cover art.jpg\n| developer = [[Ubisoft Montreal]]{{efn|Additional work by [[Ubisoft Kiev]], [[Ubisoft Toronto]], [[Ubisoft Barcelona]].}}\n| publisher = [[Ubisoft]]\n| director = Xavier Marquis\n| producer = S\u00e9bastien Labb\u00e9\n| designer = Daniel Drapeau\n| programmer = Jalal Eddine El Mansouri\n| artist = Po Yuen Kenny Lam\n| writer = Li Kuo\n| composer = {{ubl|[[Paul Haslinger]]|[[Ben Frost (musician)|Ben Frost]]}}\n| series = ''[[Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six]]''\n| engine = [[Anvil (game engine)|AnvilNext 2.0]]\n| platforms = {{ubl|[[Microsoft Windows]]|[[PlayStation 4]]|[[PlayStation 5]]|[[Xbox One]]|[[Xbox Series X]]}}\n| released = '''Microsoft Windows''', '''PlayStation 4''', '''Xbox One'''{{Video game release|WW|December 1, 2015}}'''PlayStation 5''', '''Xbox Series X'''{{Video game release|WW|Q4 2020}}\n| genre = [[Tactical shooter]]\n| modes = [[Single-player]], [[multiplayer]]\n}}\n{{Rainbow Six Siege series}}\n\n'''''Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege''''' is an [[Online game|online]] [[tactical shooter]] [[video game]] developed by [[Ubisoft Montreal]] and published by [[Ubisoft]]. It was released worldwide for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]] on December 1, 2015. It was also set to be released for [[PlayStation 5]] and [[Xbox Series X]]. The game puts heavy emphasis on environmental destruction and cooperation between players. Each player assumes control of an attacker or a defender in different gameplay modes such as rescuing a hostage, defusing a bomb, and taking control of an objective within a room. The title has no campaign but features a series of short, offline missions called, \"situations\" that can be played solo. These missions have a loose narrative, focusing on recruits going through training to prepare them for future encounters with the \"White Masks\", a terrorist group that threatens the safety of the world. \n\nIt is an entry in the ''[[Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six]]'' series and the successor to ''[[Tom Clancy's Rainbow 6: Patriots]]'', a tactical shooter that had a larger focus on narrative. However, ''Patriots'' was eventually cancelled due to its technical shortcomings, and the team decided to reboot the franchise. The team evaluated the core of the ''Rainbow Six'' franchise and believed that letting players impersonate the top counter-terrorist operatives around the world suited the game most. To create authentic siege situations, the team consulted actual [[counter-terrorism unit]]s and looked at real-life examples of sieges such as the Iranian Embassy siege. Powered by [[Anvil (game engine)|AnvilNext 2.0]], the game also utilizes Ubisoft's RealBlast technology to create destructible environments.\n\nAnnounced at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014]], it received four nominations from [[Game Critics Awards]] including Best of Show. The game received an overall positive reception from critics, with praise mostly directed to the game's tense multiplayer and focus on tactics. However, the game was criticized for its progression system and its lack of content. Initial sales were weak, but the game's player base increased significantly as Ubisoft adopted a \"[[games as a service]]\" model for the game and subsequently released several packages of free [[downloadable content]]. Several years after the game's release, some critics regarded ''Siege'' as one of the best multiplayer games in the modern market due to the improvements brought by the post-launch updates. The company partnered with [[ESL (eSports)|ESL]] to make ''Siege'' an [[esports]] game. In February 2019, the game surpassed 45 million registered players across all platforms.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/rainbow-six-siege/rainbow-six-siege-player-count|title=Rainbow Six Siege player count tops 40 million|last=Bailey|first=Dustin|date=October 30, 2018|work=PCgamesn|access-date=November 10, 2018|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181104131428/https://www.pcgamesn.com/rainbow-six-siege/rainbow-six-siege-player-count|archive-date=November 4, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|An alpha gameplay screenshot of the game, showcasing the Hostage Mode.

Players also have access to a \"Recruit\" operator who can choose from a more flexible assortment of equipment at the expense of having a unique gadget or the ability to customize their weapon. Players can pick any operator from any unit that is defending or attacking before a round starts, choosing spawn points as well attachments on their guns but are not allowed to change their choices once the round has started. An in-game shop allows players to purchase operators or cosmetics using the in-game currency, \"Renown\", which is earned at the end of matches from actions performed in-game. Different gameplay modes award renown at different rates, with ranked matches offering the largest renown multiplier potential per match. Players can also complete in-game \"challenges\" to get a small amount of renown. Renown gain rate can also be affected by the using in-game \"boosters\" which gives the player a 100% increase in all renown earned for various duration, starting with 24 hours. A premium currency known as \"R6 credits\" can also be purchased using real-world currency to get operators quicker in-game, or other cosmetic.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://support.ubi.com/en-gb/Faqs/000025856/Information-about-Renown-and-R6-credits|title=Information about Renown and R6 credits|access-date=January 11, 2018|website=ubi.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180111164932/https://support.ubi.com/en-gb/Faqs/000025856/Information-about-Renown-and-R6-credits|archive-date=January 11, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWhen the round begins in an online match, the attackers choose one of several spawn points from which to launch their attack while defenders do the same from which to defend from.

The team also consulted [[counter-terrorism unit]]s, such as the [[National Gendarmerie Intervention Group]] (GIGN), for their opinions on how they would react during a hostage rescue situation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2014/10/21/7033719/how-rainbow-six-siege-takes-inspiration-from-real-life-hostage-rescues|title=How Rainbow Six: Siege takes inspiration from real life hostage rescues|first=Colin|last=Campbell|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=October 21, 2014|accessdate=June 14, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171209100008/https://www.polygon.com/2014/10/21/7033719/how-rainbow-six-siege-takes-inspiration-from-real-life-hostage-rescues|archive-date=December 9, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> According to Xavier Marquis, the game's creative director, having a hostage rescue mission in the game helped create an immersive story. By allowing players to assume control of an operator tasked with saving innocents, it gives them an objective and a priority. They must be careful in dealing with the situation and try their best not to hurt the hostage. This further promotes teamwork between players and prompts them to plan before attacking, and further makes the game more realistic, tense and immersive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/21/how-real-life-events-influenced-rainbow-six-siege|title=How Real-Life Events Influenced Rainbow Six Siege|first=Cassidee|last=Moser|work=[[IGN]]|date=October 21, 2014|accessdate=June 14, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170607044652/http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/21/how-real-life-events-influenced-rainbow-six-siege|archive-date=June 7, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> To make the game feel more realistic, the team introduced a mechanic called \"living hostage\" to govern the hostage character's behaviour \u2013 e.g., coughing if there is dust in the air or shielding him or herself if there is nearby gunfire.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/06/26/rainbow-six-siege-to-include-male-hostages-too/|title=Rainbow Six: Siege to include male hostages, too|first=Jessica|last=Conditt|work=[[Engadget]]|date=June 26, 2014|accessdate=June 15, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171209044110/https://www.engadget.com/2014/06/26/rainbow-six-siege-to-include-male-hostages-too/|archive-date=December 9, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe environmental destruction mechanic was one of the game's most important elements. When the game's development was begun, the developer's in-house team completed their work on RealBlast Destruction, an engine that \"procedurally breaks everything down\" and remodels the environment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.ubi.com/the-art-of-destruction-in-rainbow-six-siege-an-interview-with-julien-lheureux/|title=The Art of Destruction In Rainbow Six - An Interview With Julien L'Heureux|publisher=[[Ubisoft]]|work=UbiBlog|date=March 11, 2016|accessdate=June 14, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809131938/http://blog.ubi.com/the-art-of-destruction-in-rainbow-six-siege-an-interview-with-julien-lheureux/|archivedate=August 9, 2017}}</ref> The development team thought that this technology fitted the game's style and gameplay, and decided to use it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/rainbow-six-siege-interview-finding-meaning-in-destruction|title=Rainbow Six Siege Interview: Finding Meaning in Destruction|first=Mike|last=Williams|work=[[USgamer]]|date=October 7, 2015|accessdate=June 15, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510071131/http://www.usgamer.net/articles/rainbow-six-siege-interview-finding-meaning-in-destruction|archive-date=May 10, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> This aspect of the game became increasingly important during development, and the team spent an extended period of time making sure that these destructions were authentic. As a result, the team implemented a materials-based tearing system, in which environmental objects of different materials show different reactions to players' attacks.<ref name=\"PCG1\"/> To render the game's texture, the team used [[physically based rendering]], even though it was ineffective during the game's early stage of production due to issues with the game's engine. A material bank and substance painter were utilized to create textures for environmental objects when they were damaged or destroyed. The team also implemented subtle visual cues to help players identify whether a structure was destructible or not, as opposed to \"distracting\" players with more-obvious hints.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.develop-online.net/interview/breaking-down-the-right-walls-ubisoft-montreal-on-texturing-rainbow-six-siege-s-destructible-world/0219230|title=Breaking down the (right) walls: Ubisoft Montreal on texturing Rainbow Six Siege's destructible world|first=Matthew|last=Jarvis|work=[[Develop (magazine)|Develop]]|date=April 15, 2016|accessdate=June 15, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810083236/http://www.develop-online.net/interview/breaking-down-the-right-walls-ubisoft-montreal-on-texturing-rainbow-six-siege-s-destructible-world/0219230|archive-date=August 10, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The destruction mechanic prompted Ubisoft to change their level-design approach, as they had to ensure that the level was still logical and realistic when parts of the environment were destroyed.<ref name=\"postmortem\">{{cite web|url=http://www.develop-online.net/analysis/the-develop-post-mortem-rainbow-six-siege/0233146|title=The Develop Post-Mortem: Rainbow Six Siege|work=[[Develop (magazine)|Develop]]|date=May 31, 2017|accessdate=June 15, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170605062500/http://www.develop-online.net/analysis/the-develop-post-mortem-rainbow-six-siege/0233146|archive-date=June 5, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Ubisoft, \"teamwork, tactics, and tension\" were the game's three most important pillars. The team initially worked on a respawn feature, allowing players to rejoin after they are killed in the game. However, following several internal tournaments, the team realized that some of their employees would always win a match. They concluded that the respawn system worked to the benefit of strong players and placed individual skill above teamwork,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/ubisoft-explains-why-you-wont-respawn-in-rainbow-six-siege/|title=Ubisoft explains why you won't respawn in Rainbow Six Siege|first=Andy|last=Chalk|work=[[PC Gamer]]|date=October 14, 2015|accessdate=June 15, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809170956/http://www.pcgamer.com/ubisoft-explains-why-you-wont-respawn-in-rainbow-six-siege/|archive-date=August 9, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> which did not fit the developer's focus on game tactics. Removing the respawn feature meant greater consequences for taking risks, and players had to rely on their teammates in order to survive and achieve objectives. According to Chris Lee, the game's designer, the team initially worried that the system would only appeal to hardcore players. However, after several testings, they found that the removal of the respawn system provided new challenges to strong players and forced them to cooperate with their teammates \u2013 while it rewarded weaker players who were willing to take their time, plan their actions, and be strategic.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-rainbow-six-siege-doesnt-let-you-respawn/1100-6422962/|title=Why Rainbow Six Siege Doesn't Let You Respawn|first=Eddie|last=Makuch|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=October 14, 2015|accessdate=June 15, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809131650/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-rainbow-six-siege-doesnt-let-you-respawn/1100-6422962/|archive-date=August 9, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"FP\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/inside-rainbow-six-sieges-development|title=Inside Rainbow Six: Siege's Development|first=Jaz|last=Rignall|work=[[USgamer]]|date=November 22, 2015|accessdate=June 6, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809170953/http://www.usgamer.net/articles/inside-rainbow-six-sieges-development|archive-date=August 9, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe gameplay system was designed to allow players to have a lot of freedom. As a result, the team implemented the \"Golden 3C Rules\", which represents Character, Control, and Camera.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/rainbow-six-siege-video-promises-complete-player-control/|title=Rainbow Six Siege video promises complete player control|first=Shaun|last=Prescott|work=[[PC Gamer]]|date=December 5, 2014|accessdate=June 15, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151218125902/http://www.pcgamer.com/rainbow-six-siege-video-promises-complete-player-control/|archive-date=December 18, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Players are always controlling their own actions and movements, and the team intentionally avoided any animation that would disrupt the players. As a result, actions such as setting explosives, or placing a breach charge, can be cancelled immediately so that players can react and shoot. The game's camera only moves when the player moves, as the team feared that the changes of camera angle may lead to players' in-game deaths. A free-lean system was introduced to the game so that players can have more control over their line of sight.<ref name=\"lean\"/> According to Ubisoft, this input-driven control mechanism makes the game feel more \"natural\" and \"fluid\". This is because it allows players to concentrate on planning and coordinating, rather than thinking if the camera or environment will interfere with their actions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/news/detail.aspx?c=tcm:152-187149-16&ct=tcm:148-76770-32|title=Behind The Wall: Cover and Lean|first=Chase|last=Straight|work=UbiBlog|publisher=[[Ubisoft]]|date=December 2, 2014|accessdate=June 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\nSeveral gameplay elements were scrapped or removed from the final game. One of the features of its predecessors, [[artificial intelligence]]-controlled squadmates, were removed from single-player missions. This decision was made because the team wanted players to play with a squad controlled by actual players rather than computers. The team once considered adding a map editor so that players could design their own maps, but this plan never came to fruition. Hit markers, which would indicate an injury inflicted on an opponent, were removed because the team feared that players would abuse the system by \"peppering the walls with gunfire\" and use hit markers to locate enemies. Players cannot jump in the game, as real-life counter-terrorist unit operators do not jump while carrying out their missions.<ref name=\"FP\">{{cite web|url=http://business.financialpost.com/technology/gaming/developer-interview-we-ask-what-rainbow-six-siege-brings-to-the-table-after-eight-years-away|title=Developer interview: We ask what Rainbow Six Siege brings to the table after eight years away|first=Chad|last=Sapihea|work=Post Arcade|publisher=[[Financial Post]]|date=November 25, 2015|accessdate=June 15, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190228073013/https://business.financialpost.com/technology/gaming/developer-interview-we-ask-what-rainbow-six-siege-brings-to-the-table-after-eight-years-away|archive-date=February 28, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Louis Philippe, the game's audio director, the team originally used intense music and sounds to create tension. However, the team decided to scrap this idea, realizing that the best way to create a tense atmosphere is to create the sounds of other players, which are often unexpected. The team created Navigation Sounds, in which the sound a player made is determined by their operators' weight, armour, and speed. Gadget deployment such as fortifying and breach-charging create louder sounds that may reveal the player's presence. The team thought that this would be enjoyable for players and influence their gameplay experience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/288565/Game_Design_Deep_Dive_Dynamic_audio_in_destructible_levels_in_Rainbow_Six_Siege.php|title=Game Design Deep Dive: Dynamic audio in destructible levels in Rainbow Six: Siege|first=Louis|last=Philippe Dion|work=[[Gamasutra]]|date=January 18, 2017|accessdate=June 16, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170613040057/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/288565/Game_Design_Deep_Dive_Dynamic_audio_in_destructible_levels_in_Rainbow_Six_Siege.php|archive-date=June 13, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The game's music was composed by [[Paul Haslinger]], who had worked on the score of the previous ''Rainbow Six'' games and the ''[[Far Cry]]'' series.

Critics generally praised the game's destructive environment, tactical nature, map design, and its focus on teamwork. However, the lack of content and the game's microtransactions were subjected to criticism.\n\nThe game's multiplayer was widely praised by critics. Chris Carter from ''[[Destructoid]]'' praised the game's open-ended nature, which made each match unpredictable and helped the experience to stay fresh even after an extended period of playing.<ref name=\"DestructRev\"/> [[GameSpot]]'s Scott Butterworth appreciated the title for allowing players to make use of their creativity in approaching a mission.<ref name=\"GSpotRev\"/> James Davenport from ''[[PC Gamer]]'' echoed this thought, and he described ''Siege'' as a \"psychological race\" in which players are constantly trying to outwit their opponents.<ref name=\"PCGRev\"/> Ryan McCaffery from [[IGN]] also praised the tactical possibilities, which make the game \"tense and riveting\".<ref name=\"IGNRev\"/> The large number of operators available for players to choose were praised by both Carter and Matt Bertz from ''[[Game Informer]]'', who commented that they added depths and variety to the game and that players could experiment to see which pairs of operators can complement each other.<ref name=\"GIRev\"/> However, McCaffery was disappointed by the lack of variety of game modes and commented that most players usually neglect the mode's objectives and opted to simply eliminate their opponents.<ref name=\"IGNRev\"/> Terrorist Hunt received divisive opinions from critics. Carter thought that it was more relaxing,<ref name=\"DestructRev\"/> and Butterworth thought it was exhilarating. However, Bertz criticized its lack of variety, weak [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]], and its less-intense nature when compared with the player-versus-player modes.<ref name=\"GIRev\"/> Martin Robinson from [[Eurogamer]] also noted that the mode only ran at 30 [[frames per second]], which limited its appeal.<ref name=\"EuroGRev\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-12-03-rainbow-six-siege-review|title=Rainbow Six Siege review: Six Pack|first=Martin|last=Robinson|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=December 3, 2015|accessdate=June 16, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808040913/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-12-03-rainbow-six-siege-review|archive-date=August 8, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe game's focus on tactics was praised. Bertz applauded the tactical nature of the game, as it fostered communications between players. However, he noted that teamwork may not be possible if players did not have a headphone and microphone.<ref name=\"GIRev\"/> Arthur Gies from ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' echoed these comments, stating that the game's over-reliance on teamwork meant that when teammates were not communicating, the game would not be fun to play.<ref name=\"PolyRev\"/> The \"No Respawn\" system was praised by Butterworth for making each match feel intense, as even the best player needs to think tactically in order to win.<ref name=\"GSpotRev\"/> Jonathon Leack from [[Game Revolution]] enjoyed the scouting phase of a multiplayer match, which encouraged players to communicate with each other and coordinate their attacks.<ref name=\"GameRevRev\"/> However, Gies noted that the placement of game objectives does not vary much, thus making the scouting phase meaningless. Both Bertz and Butterworth agreed that the game's competitive nature increases the game's replay value.<ref name=\"GIRev\"/><ref name=\"GSpotRev\"/> Ben Griffin from [[GamesRadar]] praised the destruction mechanic for bringing tactical depth to the game.<ref name=\"GRadarRev\"/>\n\nThe gameplay received mixed reviews. Both Bertz and Griffin criticized the game's incompetent hit detection system, which made the experience unfair.<ref name=\"GRadarRev\"/> Bertz described the game's gunplay as \"serviceable\",<ref name=\"GIRev\"/> while Leack noticed a delay in shooting, which drags the game's pace and leads to a steep learning curve. However, Leack appreciated the game's map design, which opened many possibilities. He also praised its attention to detail and sound design, which can often make a multiplayer match feel like a \"great action film\".<ref name=\"GameRevRev\"/> Bertz was disappointed by the lack of customization options, which did not offer long-term progression for the players.<ref name=\"GIRev\"/> Butterworth similarly criticized the progression system for being slow. As players cannot play as the same operator in the same match, he was often forced to play as the generic \"recruit\" character when he was only at the beginning stage of the game. He also criticized the limited weapon customization options, which barely affect gameplay.<ref name=\"GSpotRev\"/> McCaffery described customization as the \"least interesting\" aspect of the game and claimed that most gameplay features were locked when players started playing.<ref name=\"IGNRev\"/> Griffin, Gies, and Steven Burns from ''VideoGamer.com'' were annoyed by the [[microtransaction]]s featured in the game,<ref name=\"VGRev\"/><ref name=\"PolyRev\"/> with Griffin describing it as a greedy attempt by Ubisoft to make more money,<ref name=\"GRadarRev\"/> though Davenport did not mind these features as they were limited to cosmetic items and could be unlocked through earning Renown.<ref name=\"PCGRev\"/> Bertz was annoyed the lack of clan infrastructure, which may cause players troubles when they were finding matches,<ref name=\"GIRev\"/> while Griffin thought that map rotation often felt random and was disappointed that players cannot vote to decide which map they are going to play next.<ref name=\"GRadarRev\"/>\n\nSingle-player was generally considered a disappointment by critics, with Situations receiving mixed reviews. Carter described it as one of his \"favorite non-campaign additions\" as the mode gave players incentive to return due to its rating system.

The current head coach is [[\u00d3scar Tab\u00e1rez]]. The Uruguayan team is commonly referred to as '''''La Celeste''''' (The Sky Blue).\nThey have won the [[Copa Am\u00e9rica]] 15 times, the most successful national team in the tournament, the most recent title being the [[2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica|2011 edition]]. The team has won the [[FIFA World Cup]] twice, including the first World Cup in [[1930 FIFA World Cup|1930]] as hosts, defeating [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] 4\u20132 in the [[1930 FIFA World Cup Final|final]]. They won their second title in [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]], upsetting host [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] 2\u20131 in the [[Uruguay v Brazil (1950 FIFA World Cup)|final match]], which received an attendance higher than any football match ever.\n\nThey have won Gold medals at the [[Football at the Summer Olympics|Olympic football tournament]] twice, in [[Football at the 1924 Summer Olympics|1924]] and [[Football at the 1928 Summer Olympics|1928]], before the creation of the World Cup. Uruguay also won the [[1980 Mundialito]], a tournament among former World Cup champions. In total, Uruguay have won 20 official titles, a world record for the most international titles held by any country.\n\nTheir success is amplified by the fact that the nation has a very small population of around 3.4 million inhabitants (2011 est.). Uruguay is by far the smallest country in the world to have won a World Cup in terms of population, 1.75 million inhabitants in [[1930 FIFA World Cup|1930]]. The second-smallest country, by population, to have won the World Cup is [[Argentina]] with a population of nearly 28 million people in [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978]]. Uruguay is also the smallest country ever to win any World Cup medals; only six FIFA member nations with a currently smaller population than Uruguay's have ever qualified to any World Cup: [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] (three times), [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]] (twice), [[Wales national football team|Wales]], [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaica]], [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]] and [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Uruguay 1902.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Uruguay before its first match (official) v Argentina, July 1902]]\n[[File:Uruguay1928 olympic.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The team that won its second Gold Medal at the [[Football at the 1928 Summer Olympics|1928 Summer Olympics]]]]\nIn 1901, Uruguay played against Argentina in their first ever match, a close contest won by Argentina 3\u20132. Prior to 1916, Uruguay played more than 30 matches, of which all but one were against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]]. The [[1916 South American Championship|inaugural Copa America]] provided Uruguay with more varied opposition. Victories over [[Chile national football team|Chile]] and [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], along with a tie against Argentina, enabled Uruguay to win the tournament. The [[1917 South American Championship|following year]] Uruguay hosted the competition, and retained the title by winning every game. The [[1919 South American Championship|1919 Copa Am\u00e9rica]] saw Uruguay's first defeat in the tournament, a 1\u20130 defeat in a playoff with Brazil which went to two periods of extra time, the longest Copa Am\u00e9rica match in history.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\nIn 1924, the Uruguay team traveled to [[Paris]] to become the first South American team to compete in the [[1924 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]].

In the [[1928 Summer Olympics]], Uruguay went to [[Amsterdam]] to defend their title, again winning the gold medal after defeating Argentina 2\u20131 in the replay of the final (the first match was a draw after extra time). [[FIFA]] assumed the responsibility of the organization of the Football Games to be played by FIFA rules and the tournaments would be recognized as World Championships. It only happened twice (1924/1928 Summer Olympic Games) until the creation of its own FIFA World Championship, the [[FIFA World Cup]], in 1930.<ref name=\"es.fifa.com\">[http://es.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/mcwc/ip-201_02s_fwc-origin_8819.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111130914/http://es.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/mcwc/ip-201_02s_fwc-origin_8819.pdf|date=11 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Uruguay national football team 1930.jpg|thumb|left|The team that beat Argentina in the final match of the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]] to win Uruguay's first [[FIFA World Cup]]]]\nFollowing the double Olympic triumph, Uruguay was chosen as the host nation for the first [[1930 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], held in 1930, the centenary of Uruguay's first constitution. During the World Cup, Uruguay won all its matches, and converted a 1\u20132 halftime deficit to a [[1930 FIFA World Cup Final|4\u20132 victory]] against Argentina at the [[Estadio Centenario]]. Due to the refusal of some European teams to participate in the first World Cup, the [[Asociaci\u00f3n Uruguaya de F\u00fatbol|Uruguayan Football Association]] urged other countries to reciprocate by boycotting the [[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934 World Cup]] played in Italy. For the [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938 World Cup]], France was chosen as host, contrary to a previous agreement to alternate the championships between South America and Europe, so Uruguay again refused to participate.\n\n[[File:Urug1950.jpg|thumb|right|The team that beat Brazil in the decisive match of the [[1950 FIFA World Cup]] to win Uruguay's second [[FIFA World Cup]]]]\nUruguay again won the World Cup in 1950, beating hosts Brazil in one of the biggest upsets in World Cup history. The decisive match was at the [[Maracan\u00e3 Stadium]] in Brazil. Uruguay came from behind to beat the host nation in a match which would become known as the ''[[Uruguay v Brazil (1950 FIFA World Cup)|Maracanazo]]''. Many Brazilians had to be treated for shock after the event, such was the surprise of Uruguay's victory.<ref>{{cite web|title=Football, football, football|work=UruguayNow| url=http://www.uruguaynow.com/uruguayan_football.php|accessdate=13 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[File:RodolfoRodr\u00edguez-Mundialito1980.jpg|thumb|left|160px|[[Rodolfo Rodr\u00edguez (Uruguayan footballer)|Rodolfo Rodr\u00edguez]] raises the ''[[1980 Mundialito|Mundialito]]'' trophy won in January 1981]]\nAfter their fourth-place finish in the [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954 World Cup]], the team had mixed performances and after the fourth-place finish in 1970, their dominance, quality and performance dropped. They were no longer a world football power and failed to qualify for the World Cup on five occasions in the last nine competitions. They reached an all-time low and at one time ranked 76th in the [[FIFA World Rankings]].\n\nIn 2010, however, a new generation of footballers, led by [[Luis Su\u00e1rez]], [[Diego Forl\u00e1n]] and [[Edinson Cavani]], formed a team considered to be Uruguay's best in the last four decades, catching international attention after finishing fourth in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]]. Uruguay opened the tournament with a goalless draw against France, followed by defeats of South Africa (3\u20130) in and Mexico (1\u20130) respectively, finishing at the top of their group with seven points. In the second round, they played South Korea, defeating them 2\u20131 with star striker Luis Su\u00e1rez scoring a brace and earning Uruguay a spot in the quarter-finals for the first time since 1970. Against Ghana, the match finished 1\u20131, forcing the game into extra-time. Both sides had their chances at extra time but Su\u00e1rez blocked the ball with his hand in the penalty area, earning Su\u00e1rez a red card and earning Uruguay universal scorn. Ghana striker [[Asamoah Gyan]] missed the subsequent penalty, forcing the game to go into penalties where Uruguay would win 4\u20132, sending them into the last four. They played the Netherlands in the semifinals but were beaten 3\u20132. For the third-place match, they played Germany, again losing 3\u20132. This placed Uruguay in fourth place for the tournament, their best result in 40 years. Diego Forlan was awarded the Player of The Tournament.\n\n[[File:2018 FIFA World Cup Group A march URU-KSA - Anthems.jpg|thumb|Uruguay - Saudi Arabia match at the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] in Russia]]\nA year later, they won the [[2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica|Copa America]] for the first time in 16 years and broke the record for the most successful team in South America. Luis Su\u00e1rez ended up as the Player of The Tournament.\nIn the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]] Uruguay was placed in Group D alongside [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]], [[England national football team|England]], and [[Italy national football team|Italy]]. They were upset by Costa Rica in the opening match, losing 3\u20131 despite taking the lead in the first half. They rebounded with a 2\u20131 victory over England, in which Su\u00e1rez scored a brace right after coming back from an injury, and a 1\u20130 victory over Italy, placing them second in their group and earning a spot in the last 16.

The current head coach is [[\u00d3scar Tab\u00e1rez]]. The Uruguayan team is commonly referred to as '''''La Celeste''''' (The Sky Blue).\nThey have won the [[Copa Am\u00e9rica]] 15 times, the most successful national team in the tournament, the most recent title being the [[2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica|2011 edition]]. The team has won the [[FIFA World Cup]] twice, including the first World Cup in [[1930 FIFA World Cup|1930]] as hosts, defeating [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] 4\u20132 in the [[1930 FIFA World Cup Final|final]]. They won their second title in [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]], upsetting host [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] 2\u20131 in the [[Uruguay v Brazil (1950 FIFA World Cup)|final match]], which received an attendance higher than any football match ever.\n\nThey have won Gold medals at the [[Football at the Summer Olympics|Olympic football tournament]] twice, in [[Football at the 1924 Summer Olympics|1924]] and [[Football at the 1928 Summer Olympics|1928]], before the creation of the World Cup. Uruguay also won the [[1980 Mundialito]], a tournament among former World Cup champions. In total, Uruguay have won 20 official titles, a world record for the most international titles held by any country.\n\nTheir success is amplified by the fact that the nation has a very small population of around 3.4 million inhabitants (2011 est.). Uruguay is by far the smallest country in the world to have won a World Cup in terms of population, 1.75 million inhabitants in [[1930 FIFA World Cup|1930]]. The second-smallest country, by population, to have won the World Cup is [[Argentina]] with a population of nearly 28 million people in [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978]]. Uruguay is also the smallest country ever to win any World Cup medals; only six FIFA member nations with a currently smaller population than Uruguay's have ever qualified to any World Cup: [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] (three times), [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]] (twice), [[Wales national football team|Wales]], [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaica]], [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]] and [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Uruguay 1902.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Uruguay before its first match (official) v Argentina, July 1902]]\n[[File:Uruguay1928 olympic.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The team that won its second Gold Medal at the [[Football at the 1928 Summer Olympics|1928 Summer Olympics]]]]\nIn 1901, Uruguay played against Argentina in their first ever match, a close contest won by Argentina 3\u20132. Prior to 1916, Uruguay played more than 30 matches, of which all but one were against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]]. The [[1916 South American Championship|inaugural Copa America]] provided Uruguay with more varied opposition. Victories over [[Chile national football team|Chile]] and [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], along with a tie against Argentina, enabled Uruguay to win the tournament. The [[1917 South American Championship|following year]] Uruguay hosted the competition, and retained the title by winning every game. The [[1919 South American Championship|1919 Copa Am\u00e9rica]] saw Uruguay's first defeat in the tournament, a 1\u20130 defeat in a playoff with Brazil which went to two periods of extra time, the longest Copa Am\u00e9rica match in history.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\nIn 1924, the Uruguay team traveled to [[Paris]] to become the first South American team to compete in the [[1924 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]].

During the World Cup, Uruguay won all its matches, and converted a 1\u20132 halftime deficit to a [[1930 FIFA World Cup Final|4\u20132 victory]] against Argentina at the [[Estadio Centenario]]. Due to the refusal of some European teams to participate in the first World Cup, the [[Asociaci\u00f3n Uruguaya de F\u00fatbol|Uruguayan Football Association]] urged other countries to reciprocate by boycotting the [[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934 World Cup]] played in Italy.

The decisive match was at the [[Maracan\u00e3 Stadium]] in Brazil.

They were no longer a world football power and failed to qualify for the World Cup on five occasions in the last nine competitions. They reached an all-time low and at one time ranked 76th in the [[FIFA World Rankings]].\n\nIn 2010, however, a new generation of footballers, led by [[Luis Su\u00e1rez]], [[Diego Forl\u00e1n]] and [[Edinson Cavani]], formed a team considered to be Uruguay's best in the last four decades, catching international attention after finishing fourth in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]]. Uruguay opened the tournament with a goalless draw against France, followed by defeats of South Africa (3\u20130) in and Mexico (1\u20130) respectively, finishing at the top of their group with seven points. In the second round, they played South Korea, defeating them 2\u20131 with star striker Luis Su\u00e1rez scoring a brace and earning Uruguay a spot in the quarter-finals for the first time since 1970. Against Ghana, the match finished 1\u20131, forcing the game into extra-time. Both sides had their chances at extra time but Su\u00e1rez blocked the ball with his hand in the penalty area, earning Su\u00e1rez a red card and earning Uruguay universal scorn. Ghana striker [[Asamoah Gyan]] missed the subsequent penalty, forcing the game to go into penalties where Uruguay would win 4\u20132, sending them into the last four. They played the Netherlands in the semifinals but were beaten 3\u20132. For the third-place match, they played Germany, again losing 3\u20132. This placed Uruguay in fourth place for the tournament, their best result in 40 years. Diego Forlan was awarded the Player of The Tournament.\n\n[[File:2018 FIFA World Cup Group A march URU-KSA - Anthems.jpg|thumb|Uruguay - Saudi Arabia match at the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] in Russia]]\nA year later, they won the [[2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica|Copa America]] for the first time in 16 years and broke the record for the most successful team in South America.
