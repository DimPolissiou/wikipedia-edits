Enshrined in Articles 15 and 16 of the Indian Constitution, it allows the Indian government to set quotas to ensure any \"socially and educationally backward classes of citizens\" is properly represented in public life.  It is intended to realise the promise of equality enshrined in the [[Constitution of India]].\n\nReservation is primarily given to 3 groups: [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes]], and [[Other Backward Classes]], abbreviated as SC, ST, and OBC respectively. These are groups that have faced social and economic discrimination in the past and/or the present and were severely underrepresented in public life. Originally reservation was only given to SCs and STs but was later extended to OBCs in 1987 after the implementation of the [[Mandal Commission]] report.

These castes have hereditary professions considered impure by South Asian society, such as sewage cleaning, tannery, or washing clothes, and were thus considered ''polluted'' by other castes. They are subject to the practice of [[untouchability]], which takes the form of various social restrictions ranging from inability to touch other castes to inability to use the same water source or even live in the same area. Historically, and even now, they were barred from entering temples and other places of worship, and sometimes were not allowed to use the same roads. Today many of these castes, as well as following their traditional occupations, are also landless agricultural labourers. They are much more behind than all other castes on economic indicators like poverty or literacy. They make up around 220 million people, 17% of India's population.\n* The next group are the [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|Scheduled Tribes]]. The definition of this group varies, but the criteria for a Scheduled Tribe \"indications of primitive traits, distinctive culture, geographical isolation, shyness of contact with the community at large, and backwardness.\" Most of these groups are considered [[Adivasi]]s, and the original inhabitants while others are nomadic tribes who were notified as \"criminal tribes\" under British rule. They range in modes of existence from subsistence agriculturalists who have had interaction between the outside world to hunter-gatherer groups still in the jungles. They have suffered from exploitation of their land by both ''zamindars'' and the British, and often the same social discrimination meted out to Dalits. However, in the Northeast, many of the tribals are relatively better-off and interact much more with the outside world. They are around 100 million people, around 8% of the population. Examples include the [[Boro people|Bodo]], [[Gondi people|Gondi]], [[Banjara]], and [[Santal people|Santal]].\n* The third main group are the [[Other Backward Class]]es. They were not originally in the reservation scheme, but during the premiership of Moraji Desai, the Mandal Commission studied all the communitiesin India to find what castes were \"backward\" compared to the general population. Based on 1931 census data, they estimated 52% of India's population belonged to castes that were \"backward\" due to various socioeconomic factors like wealth or jobs performed. The possibility for providing reservation to these people was allowed for in Article 15(4) and Article 16(4), which states the government can provide reservation to \"backward classes.\" Although the Centre maintains its own list of OBC's, comprising over 5,000 castes and subcastes, each state can create their own backward caste list for in-state reservations. Most OBCs are lower castes, were classfiied originally in the ''shudra'' varna, and have low ritual status. However, there are other castes in the OBC list who, although ritually low, are economically dominant and in many cases are the enforcers of the caste hierarchy, including some Brahmin groups. In some states there is a divide between backward castes, who face some socioeconomic disadvantage and most backward or extremely backward castes, who face a high amount of social discrimination barely above Dalits in their status. In fact, unlike Scheduled Castes, OBCs do not have to be Hindu and many states give benefits to some Muslim and Christian communities. This list is most subject to change since the criteria is not as stringent, making it a list added to often by politicians to please certain sections of their voters.\n\nThose who are not a member of these groups are lumped together in the General category, sometimes called the Open category. These are made up of mostly high castes who do not qualify for reservations: most communities in the Brahmin, Kshatriya and Vaishya varnas. However, seats listed for general category can be taken by anyone irrespective of reservation status.\n\n==History==\n\n===Before independence===\nQuota systems favouring certain castes and other communities existed before [[Independence of India|independence]] in several areas of [[British India]]. Demands for various forms of positive discrimination had been made, for example, in 1882 and 1891.<ref name=\"ILI Law Review\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ili.ac.in/pdf/article_2.pdf|title=Rethinking Reservation in Higher Education in India|last=Laskar|first=Mehbubul Hassan|publisher=ILI Law Review|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425081633/http://www.ili.ac.in/pdf/article_2.pdf|archivedate=25 April 2012 |pages=29\u201330}}</ref> [[Shahu of Kolhapur|Shahu]], the Maharaja of the [[princely state]] of [[Kolhapur State|Kolhapur]], introduced reservation in favour of non-[[Brahmin]] and backward classes, much of which came into force in 1902. He provided free education to everyone and opened several hostels to make it easier for them to receive it. He also tried to ensure that people thus educated were suitably employed, and he appealed both for a class-free India and the abolition of [[untouchability]]. His 1902 measures created 50 percent reservation for backward communities.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\nOn 16 September 1921, the first [[Justice Party (India)|Justice Party]] government passed the first Communal Government Order (G. O. # 613), thereby becoming the first elected body in the Indian legislative history to legislate reservations, which have since become standard across the country.\n\nThe [[British Raj]] introduced elements of reservation in the [[Indian Councils Act 1909|Government of India Act of 1909]] and there were many other measures put in place prior to independence.<ref name=\"ILI Law Review\" /> A significant one emerged from the [[Round Table Conferences (India)|Round Table Conference of June 1932]], when the  Prime Minister of Britain, [[Ramsay MacDonald]], proposed the [[Communal Award]], according to which separate representation was to be provided for [[Muslims]], [[Sikhs]], [[Indian Christians]], [[Anglo-Indians]], and [[Europeans]]. The depressed classes, roughly corresponding to the STs and SCs, were assigned a number of seats to be filled by election from constituencies in which only they could vote, although they could also vote in other seats. The proposal was controversial: [[Mahatma Gandhi]] fasted in protest against it but many among the depressed classes, including their leader, [[B. R. Ambedkar]], favoured it. After negotiations, Gandhi reached an agreement with Ambedkar to have a single Hindu electorate, with [[Dalits]] having seats reserved within it. Electorates for other religions, such as Islam and Sikhism, remained separate. This became known as the [[Poona Pact]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Transfer of Power in India |first=V.

Enshrined in Articles 15 and 16 of the Indian Constitution, it allows the Indian government to set quotas to ensure any \"socially and educationally backward classes of citizens\" is properly represented in public life.  It is intended to realise the promise of equality enshrined in the [[Constitution of India]].\n\nReservation is primarily given to 3 groups: [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes]], and [[Other Backward Classes]], abbreviated as SC, ST, and OBC respectively. These are groups that have faced social and economic discrimination in the past and/or the present and were severely underrepresented in public life.

These castes have hereditary professions considered impure by South Asian society, such as sewage cleaning, tannery, or washing clothes, and were thus considered ''polluted'' by other castes. They are subject to the practice of [[untouchability]], which takes the form of various social restrictions ranging from inability to touch other castes to inability to use the same water source or even live in the same area. Historically, and even now, they were barred from entering temples and other places of worship, and sometimes were not allowed to use the same roads. Today many of these castes, as well as following their traditional occupations, are also landless agricultural labourers. They are much more behind than all other castes on economic indicators like poverty or literacy. They make up around 220 million people, 17% of India's population.\n* The next group are the [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|Scheduled Tribes]]. The definition of this group varies, but the criteria for a Scheduled Tribe \"indications of primitive traits, distinctive culture, geographical isolation, shyness of contact with the community at large, and backwardness.\" Most of these groups are considered [[Adivasi]]s, and the original inhabitants while others are nomadic tribes who were notified as \"criminal tribes\" under British rule. They range in modes of existence from subsistence agriculturalists who have had interaction between the outside world to hunter-gatherer groups still in the jungles. They have suffered from exploitation of their land by both ''zamindars'' and the British, and often the same social discrimination meted out to Dalits. However, in the Northeast, many of the tribals are relatively better-off and interact much more with the outside world. They are around 100 million people, around 8% of the population. Examples include the [[Boro people|Bodo]], [[Gondi people|Gondi]], [[Banjara]], and [[Santal people|Santal]].\n* The third main group are the [[Other Backward Class]]es. They were not originally in the reservation scheme, but during the premiership of Moraji Desai, the Mandal Commission studied all the communitiesin India to find what castes were \"backward\" compared to the general population. Based on 1931 census data, they estimated 52% of India's population belonged to castes that were \"backward\" due to various socioeconomic factors like wealth or jobs performed. The possibility for providing reservation to these people was allowed for in Article 15(4) and Article 16(4), which states the government can provide reservation to \"backward classes.\" Although the Centre maintains its own list of OBC's, comprising over 5,000 castes and subcastes, each state can create their own backward caste list for in-state reservations. Most OBCs are lower castes, were classfiied originally in the ''shudra'' varna, and have low ritual status. However, there are other castes in the OBC list who, although ritually low, are economically dominant and in many cases are the enforcers of the caste hierarchy, including some Brahmin groups. In some states there is a divide between backward castes, who face some socioeconomic disadvantage and most backward or extremely backward castes, who face a high amount of social discrimination barely above Dalits in their status. In fact, unlike Scheduled Castes, OBCs do not have to be Hindu and many states give benefits to some Muslim and Christian communities. This list is most subject to change since the criteria is not as stringent, making it a list added to often by politicians to please certain sections of their voters.\n\nThose who are not a member of these groups are lumped together in the General category, sometimes called the Open category. These are made up of mostly high castes who do not qualify for reservations: most communities in the Brahmin, Kshatriya and Vaishya varnas. However, seats listed for general category can be taken by anyone irrespective of reservation status.\n\n==History==\n\n===Before independence===\nQuota systems favouring certain castes and other communities existed before [[Independence of India|independence]] in several areas of [[British India]]. Demands for various forms of positive discrimination had been made, for example, in 1882 and 1891.<ref name=\"ILI Law Review\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ili.ac.in/pdf/article_2.pdf|title=Rethinking Reservation in Higher Education in India|last=Laskar|first=Mehbubul Hassan|publisher=ILI Law Review|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425081633/http://www.ili.ac.in/pdf/article_2.pdf|archivedate=25 April 2012 |pages=29\u201330}}</ref> [[Shahu of Kolhapur|Shahu]], the Maharaja of the [[princely state]] of [[Kolhapur State|Kolhapur]], introduced reservation in favour of non-[[Brahmin]] and backward classes, much of which came into force in 1902. He provided free education to everyone and opened several hostels to make it easier for them to receive it. He also tried to ensure that people thus educated were suitably employed, and he appealed both for a class-free India and the abolition of [[untouchability]]. His 1902 measures created 50 percent reservation for backward communities.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\nOn 16 September 1921, the first [[Justice Party (India)|Justice Party]] government passed the first Communal Government Order (G. O. # 613), thereby becoming the first elected body in the Indian legislative history to legislate reservations, which have since become standard across the country.\n\nThe [[British Raj]] introduced elements of reservation in the [[Indian Councils Act 1909|Government of India Act of 1909]] and there were many other measures put in place prior to independence.<ref name=\"ILI Law Review\" /> A significant one emerged from the [[Round Table Conferences (India)|Round Table Conference of June 1932]], when the  Prime Minister of Britain, [[Ramsay MacDonald]], proposed the [[Communal Award]], according to which separate representation was to be provided for [[Muslims]], [[Sikhs]], [[Indian Christians]], [[Anglo-Indians]], and [[Europeans]]. The depressed classes, roughly corresponding to the STs and SCs, were assigned a number of seats to be filled by election from constituencies in which only they could vote, although they could also vote in other seats. The proposal was controversial: [[Mahatma Gandhi]] fasted in protest against it but many among the depressed classes, including their leader, [[B. R. Ambedkar]], favoured it. After negotiations, Gandhi reached an agreement with Ambedkar to have a single Hindu electorate, with [[Dalits]] having seats reserved within it. Electorates for other religions, such as Islam and Sikhism, remained separate. This became known as the [[Poona Pact]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Transfer of Power in India |first=V.
