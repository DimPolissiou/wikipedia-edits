Based on the [[Lego]] line of [[construction toy]]s, its story focuses on an ordinary [[Lego minifigure]] who finds himself helping a [[Resistance movement|resistance]] stop a tyrannical businessman from gluing everything in the Lego world into his vision of perfection. [[Chris Pratt]], [[Will Ferrell]], [[Elizabeth Banks]], [[Will Arnett]], [[Nick Offerman]], [[Alison Brie]], [[Charlie Day]], [[Liam Neeson]], and [[Morgan Freeman]] provide their voices for the film's main characters.

Pictures]]. It became a critical and commercial success, grossing $468 million worldwide against its $60 million budget, and received praise for its animation, story, writing, humor, and voice performances. The film won the [[BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film]], the [[Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Animated Feature]], and the [[Saturn Award for Best Animated Film]]; it was also nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film]] and received an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] for \"[[Everything Is Awesome]]\".\n\nThe film has since expanded into a major [[The Lego Movie (franchise)|franchise]] which ties into the Lego brand, with the sequel ''[[The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part]]'' released in 2019. The [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] films ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'' and ''[[The Lego Ninjago Movie]]'' were both released in 2017, with another titled ''The Billion Brick Race'' in development. A [[4D film]] based on the film itself, entitled ''[[The Lego Movie: 4D \u2013 A New Adventure]]'', was released to [[Legoland]] parks across the world after its premiere at [[Legoland Florida]] in 2016.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the [[Lego]] universe, populated by [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[Lego minifigure|minifigures]], Lord Business steals a super-weapon named the \"Kragle\" (aka krazy glue) and blinds Vitruvius, a wizard who attempted to stop Business. He speaks of a prophecy before being kicked by Lord Business into a lava lake.\n\nEight-and-a-half years later, in the city of [[LEGO City|Bricksburg]] under the power of Business (under the title of \"President Business\"), ordinary construction worker [[Emmet Brickowski]] notices a mysterious woman and falls underground attempting to confront the trespasser. Emmet sees a mysterious piece and receives epileptic visions after touching it. He awakens in the custody of Good cop/Bad cop, Lord Business's lieutenant, with the piece, referred to by Bad cop as \"the Piece of Resistance\", glued on his back.\n\nThe woman (named Wyldstyle) rescues Emmet from an attempt to disconnect the piece from him and brings him to Vitruvius in the [[Lego Wild West|Old West]]. Emmet learns Wyldstyle and Vitruvius are \"Master Builders\",<ref name=\"EWKnowAllTheStuff\">{{cite news|last1=Busis|first1=Hillary|title=Want to know all the stuff 'The Lego Movie' is riffing on?

Wyldstyle explains that Business wants to use the Kragle (a tube of [[Cyanoacrylate|Krazy Glue]]) to freeze the world into his own personal vision of orderly perfection. Though disappointed to find Emmet is not a Master Builder, Wyldstyle and Vitruvius are convinced of his potential when he recalls visions of a deity referred to as \"The Man Upstairs\" and Emmet's possession of the Piece of Resistance, which is revealed as capable of disarming the Kragle.\n\nEmmet, Wyldstyle and Vitruvius evade Bad Cop's forces with the aid of [[Batman]], Wyldstyle's boyfriend. They visit the hidden realm of [[Cloud Cuckoo Land]], where they meet Unikitty. They attend a council of Master Builders, who are unimpressed with Emmet and refuse to fight Business. Bad Cop's forces invade Cloud Cuckoo Land, having placed a tracking device on Emmet. Emmet, Wyldstyle, Batman, Vitruvius, Unikitty and an [[Lego Space#\"Classic\" Space (1978\u20131987)|astronaut]] named Benny manage to escape, as Cloud Cuckoo Land is destroyed. Emmet devises a plan to infiltrate Business's office tower and disarm the Kragle with aid from his friends, and the robot pirate MetalBeard. The plan nearly succeeds, but the group is captured and imprisoned in the Think Tank, where the Master Builders are forced to make instructions. Vitruvius resists but is decapitated by Business, who throws the Piece of Resistance into the abyss outside the tower, sets a self-destruct protocol and leaves everyone to die, including Bad Cop.\n\nA dying Vitruvius reveals he made up the prophecy. He soon reappears to Emmet as a ghost and reveals that self-belief is what makes one the Special. Strapped to the self-destruct mechanism's battery, Emmet jumps into the abyss and severs the connection, saving his friends. Inspired by Emmet's sacrifice, Wyldstyle (now her real name Lucy) rallies the Lego people across the universe to build weapons and vehicles to fight Lord Business's army of Micro Managers while Bad Cop allies with the Master Builders.\n\nEmmet awakens in the human world, unable to move. He discovers the events are being portrayed out by Finn, a boy playing in a family's expansive Lego collection kept in the basement; \"The Man Upstairs\", revealed to be Finn's father, enters the basement and is disgusted to see them modified, and uses Krazy Glue in an attempt to restore novelty to the damage. Realizing the danger, Emmet catches Finn's attention, who distracts his father long enough to retrieve the \"Piece of Resistance\" (the Krazy Glue cap) and \"reenter\" Emmet to the Lego world.\n\nEmmet, now a Master Builder, lands in a construction site and attacks Business's army base. At the same time, Finn's father has an epiphany when he discovers Finn has based the villainous Lord Business on ''him'' and his [[Greed|greedy]] [[perfectionism]]. Through a speech Emmet gives to Business, Finn's father, redeems himself by hugging his son and ungluing the constructions with [[White spirit|mineral spirits]]; in the Lego world, Business combines the Kragle with the Piece of Resistance, frees his victims, and thanks Emmet, who is then hailed as a hero, and begins a romantic relationship with Lucy, with Batman's blessing.\n\nThe film ends with aliens from the planet [[Lego Duplo|Duplo]] beaming down to the Lego world, as a result of Finn's father inviting Finn's younger sister to join their play.\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|List of The Lego Movie characters}}\n* [[Chris Pratt]] as [[Emmet Brickowski]], an [[everyman]] and construction worker from Bricksburg who is initially mistaken for the Special.\n* [[Will Ferrell]] as Lord Business, an evil businessman and tyrant of Bricksburg and the Lego Universe who is the company president of the [[Octan|Octan Corporation]] under the name President Business.<ref name=USATodayMeet>{{cite news|last=Alexander|first=Bryan|title='The Lego Movie' hopes to cement a built-in fan base|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/10/23/lego-movie-peek-will-ferrell/2918385/|accessdate=October 24, 2013|newspaper=USA Today|date=October 23, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024043838/http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/10/23/lego-movie-peek-will-ferrell/2918385/|archive-date=October 24, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"hollywoodreporter1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lego-will-ferrell-liam-neeson-388097|title=Lego: Will Ferrell, Liam Neeson Join Animated Film|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=November 9, 2012|accessdate=April 7, 2013|archive-date=May 13, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513141850/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lego-will-ferrell-liam-neeson-388097|url-status=live}}</ref> \n** Ferrell also plays \"The Man Upstairs\", a Lego collector and Finn's father in the live-action part of the film.\n* [[Elizabeth Banks]] as Lucy / Wyldstyle, a \"tough as nails\" and tech-savvy fighter who is one of the Master Builders.\n* [[Will Arnett]] as [[Batman|Bruce Wayne / Batman]], a [[DC Comics]] superhero who is a Master Builder.\n* [[Nick Offerman]] as Metal Beard,<!--Two words in the end-credits--> a pirate and Master Builder seeking revenge on Lord Business for taking his body parts following an earlier encounter and causing him to remake his body from bricks.<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter1\"/>\n* [[Alison Brie]] as Princess Unikitty, a unicorn-horned kitten and Master Builder that lives in [[Cloud cuckoo land|Cloud Cuckoo Land]].<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter1\"/><ref name=YahooWonderKitty>{{cite news|last=Enk|first=Bryan|title=Wonder Woman Finally Gets Her Movie Close-Up ... but How Does the Lego Unikitty Fit In?|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/blogs/movie-talk/superheroes-assemble-hilariously-lego-movie-trailer-214117774.html|accessdate=November 2, 2013|publisher=Yahoo!

Animal Logic tried to make the film's animation replicate a [[stop motion]] film even if everything was done through computer graphics, with the [[Skeletal animation|animation rigs]] following the same articulation limits actual Lego figures have. The camera systems also tried to replicate live action cinematography, including different lenses and a [[Steadicam]] simulator. The scenery was projected through The Lego Group's own [[Lego Digital Designer]] (created as part of [[Lego Design byME]], which people could design their own Lego models using LDD, then upload them to the Lego website, design their own box design, and order them for actual delivery), which as CG supervisor Aidan Sarsfield detailed, \"uses the official LEGO Brick Library and effectively simulates the connectivity of each of the bricks\". The saved files were then converted to design and animate in [[Autodesk Maya|Maya]] and [[Autodesk Softimage|XSI]]. At times the minifigures were even placed under microscopes to capture the seam lines, dirt and grime into the digital textures.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fxguide.com/featured/brick-by-brick-how-animal-logic-crafted-the-lego-movie/|title=Brick-by-brick: how Animal Logic crafted The LEGO Movie|publisher=fxguide|date=February 7, 2014|accessdate=March 7, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209091156/https://www.fxguide.com/featured/brick-by-brick-how-animal-logic-crafted-the-lego-movie/|archivedate=February 9, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> Benny the spaceman was based on the line of Lego space sets sold in the 1980s, and his design includes the broken helmet chin strap, a common defect of the space sets at that time.<ref>{{cite news|department=[[Yahoo!

Based on the [[Lego]] line of [[construction toy]]s, its story focuses on an ordinary [[Lego minifigure]] who finds himself helping a [[Resistance movement|resistance]] stop a tyrannical businessman from gluing everything in the Lego world into his vision of perfection. [[Chris Pratt]], [[Will Ferrell]], [[Elizabeth Banks]], [[Will Arnett]], [[Nick Offerman]], [[Alison Brie]], [[Charlie Day]], [[Liam Neeson]], and [[Morgan Freeman]] provide their voices for the film's main characters.

Pictures]]. It became a critical and commercial success, grossing $468 million worldwide against its $60 million budget, and received praise for its animation, story, writing, humor, and voice performances. The film won the [[BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film]], the [[Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Animated Feature]], and the [[Saturn Award for Best Animated Film]]; it was also nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film]] and received an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] for \"[[Everything Is Awesome]]\".\n\nThe film has since expanded into a major [[The Lego Movie (franchise)|franchise]] which ties into the Lego brand, with the sequel ''[[The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part]]'' released in 2019. The [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] films ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'' and ''[[The Lego Ninjago Movie]]'' were both released in 2017, with another titled ''The Billion Brick Race'' in development. A [[4D film]] based on the film itself, entitled ''[[The Lego Movie: 4D \u2013 A New Adventure]]'', was released to [[Legoland]] parks across the world after its premiere at [[Legoland Florida]] in 2016.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the [[Lego]] universe, populated by [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[Lego minifigure|minifigures]], Lord Business steals a super-weapon named the \"Kragle\" and blinds Vitruvius, a wizard who attempted to stop Business. He speaks of a prophecy before being kicked by Lord Business into a lava lake.\n\nEight-and-a-half years later, in the city of [[LEGO City|Bricksburg]] under the power of Business (under the title of \"President Business\"), ordinary construction worker [[Emmet Brickowski]] notices a mysterious woman and falls underground attempting to confront the trespasser. Emmet sees a mysterious piece and receives epileptic visions after touching it. He awakens in the custody of Good cop/Bad cop, Lord Business's lieutenant, with the piece, referred to by Bad cop as \"the Piece of Resistance\", glued on his back.\n\nThe woman (named Wyldstyle) rescues Emmet from an attempt to disconnect the piece from him and brings him to Vitruvius in the [[Lego Wild West|Old West]]. Emmet learns Wyldstyle and Vitruvius are \"Master Builders\",<ref name=\"EWKnowAllTheStuff\">{{cite news|last1=Busis|first1=Hillary|title=Want to know all the stuff 'The Lego Movie' is riffing on? Here are a reference guide|url=https://www.ew.com/article/2014/02/14/lego-movie-reference-guide|accessdate=November 15, 2016|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=February 14, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170112183017/http://ew.com/article/2014/02/14/lego-movie-reference-guide/|archive-date=January 12, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> capable of building anything from their imagination without instructions. Wyldstyle explains that Business wants to use the Kragle (a tube of [[Cyanoacrylate|Krazy Glue]]) to freeze the world into his own personal vision of orderly perfection. Though disappointed to find Emmet is not a Master Builder, Wyldstyle and Vitruvius are convinced of his potential when he recalls visions of a deity referred to as \"The Man Upstairs\" and Emmet's possession of the Piece of Resistance, which is revealed as capable of disarming the Kragle.\n\nEmmet, Wyldstyle and Vitruvius evade Bad Cop's forces with the aid of [[Batman]], Wyldstyle's boyfriend. They visit the hidden realm of [[Cloud Cuckoo Land]], where they meet Unikitty. They attend a council of Master Builders, who are unimpressed with Emmet and refuse to fight Business. Bad Cop's forces invade Cloud Cuckoo Land, having placed a tracking device on Emmet. Emmet, Wyldstyle, Batman, Vitruvius, Unikitty and an [[Lego Space#\"Classic\" Space (1978\u20131987)|astronaut]] named Benny manage to escape, as Cloud Cuckoo Land is destroyed. Emmet devises a plan to infiltrate Business's office tower and disarm the Kragle with aid from his friends, and the robot pirate MetalBeard. The plan nearly succeeds, but the group is captured and imprisoned in the Think Tank, where the Master Builders are forced to make instructions. Vitruvius resists but is decapitated by Business, who throws the Piece of Resistance into the abyss outside the tower, sets a self-destruct protocol and leaves everyone to die, including Bad Cop.\n\nA dying Vitruvius reveals he made up the prophecy. He soon reappears to Emmet as a ghost and reveals that self-belief is what makes one the Special. Strapped to the self-destruct mechanism's battery, Emmet jumps into the abyss and severs the connection, saving his friends. Inspired by Emmet's sacrifice, Wyldstyle (now her real name Lucy) rallies the Lego people across the universe to build weapons and vehicles to fight Lord Business's army of Micro Managers while Bad Cop allies with the Master Builders.\n\nEmmet awakens in the human world, unable to move. He discovers the events are being portrayed out by Finn, a boy playing in a family's expansive Lego collection kept in the basement; \"The Man Upstairs\", revealed to be Finn's father, enters the basement and is disgusted to see them modified, and uses Krazy Glue in an attempt to restore novelty to the damage. Realizing the danger, Emmet catches Finn's attention, who distracts his father long enough to retrieve the \"Piece of Resistance\" (the Krazy Glue cap) and \"reenter\" Emmet to the Lego world.\n\nEmmet, now a Master Builder, lands in a construction site and attacks Business's army base. At the same time, Finn's father has an epiphany when he discovers Finn has based the villainous Lord Business on ''him'' and his [[Greed|greedy]] [[perfectionism]].

The camera systems also tried to replicate live action cinematography, including different lenses and a [[Steadicam]] simulator. The scenery was projected through The Lego Group's own [[Lego Digital Designer]] (created as part of [[Lego Design byME]], which people could design their own Lego models using LDD, then upload them to the Lego website, design their own box design, and order them for actual delivery), which as CG supervisor Aidan Sarsfield detailed, \"uses the official LEGO Brick Library and effectively simulates the connectivity of each of the bricks\".

During his Leela at [[Nabadwip]], Lord Sri [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] was travelling towards Sri [[Vrindavan]] in divine ecstasy, Srila [[Nitai]], however, diverted the lord from Sri [[Vrindavan]] and took him to Sripad [[Advaita Acharya]]'s residence, in [[Shantipur]]. Lord [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] stayed in [[Shantipur]] for ten days and then ignoring the tearful eyes of [[Shantipur]]'s residents and grief-stricken requests from his mother, [https://gaudiyahistory.iskcondesiretree.com/saci-devi/ Sachi Devi]; He left [[Shantipur]] for [[Jagannath Temple, Puri]]. [[Advaita Acharya]] could not bear the pangs of separation from Mahaprabhu, and in anticipation of parting, Adwaitya Acharya in a fit of grief cursed Mahaprabhu saying - \"You have stayed here for ten days, but in this incarnation, your work will remain incomplete, you have to re-incarnate in my family as my tenth generation.\"\n\nMahaprabhu re-appeared in Shantipur as a tenth generation successor of Sripad Adwaitya Acharya as Prabhupad Sri Sri Bijoy Krishna Goswami.\n\n== Early Life ==\nPrabhupad Sri Bijoy Krishna Goswami (Gosaiji) was born on 2nd August 1841 Shikarpur ([[Nadia district|Nadia]]), to Ananda Kishore Goswami and Swarnamoyee Devi. Desirous of a child, Ananda Kishore Goswami Prabhu travelled from [[Shantipur]] to [[Jagannath Temple, Puri]], performing [[Prostration (Buddhism)|dandavat prostration]] all along the way. This method of travelling took him one and a half year to reach [[Puri]]. The night he arrived at the [[Jagannath Temple, Puri]], he dreamt of [[Jagannath]] Swami, who promised him that he would take birth as his son. Thus, assured Ananda Kishore Goswami returned home to [[Shantipur]]. It is a typical pattern for saints to be born outside the confines of homes. [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] was born under a [[Azadirachta indica|neem]] tree, [[Jesus|Lord Jesus Christ]] was born in a manger, and [[Gautama Buddha]] was born in [[Lumbini]] garden likewise Gosaiji too was born in a [[colocasia]] thicket at Shikarpur (Nadia). \n\nThe family deity worshipped in the Goswami household was [https://iskconvrindavan.com/2019/08/01/shyamsundar-the-reservoir-of-all-beauty/ Sri Shyamsundar]. Shyamsundar would appear before Gosaiji and became a playmate of the infant Gosaiji. This ''[[Bhava|sakhyabh\u0101va]] (''the attitude of a friend) with Shyamsundar would remain with Gosaiji throughout in his life. \n\nAnanda Kishore Goswami passed away on 1844 AD, entering into [[Bhava samadhi|maha bhava samadhi]] while reciting the [[Bhagavata Purana|Srimad Bhagavatam]]; Gosaiji was then only three years old. Goswamiji started his academic life in 1850 AD, enrolling in the Bhagwan Sarkar's [[Sanskrit]] school at Shikarpur. He also studied [[Vedanta]] under the tutelage of Acharya Krishna Gopal Goswami. He later joined the [[The Sanskrit College and University|Calcutta Sanskrit College]], during this time he married Ramchandra Bhaduri's eldest daughter Yogmaya Devi. It was a tradition in the Goswami family of becoming hereditary spiritual preceptor of devoted families. In keeping with the culture, Gosaiji once visited the family of a disciple, who begged him for redemption. Gosaiji was shocked; he thought - ''\"How can I provide salvation when I am myself bound to [[Sa\u1e43s\u0101ra]]?\" ;'' Gosaiji consequently, left the ancestral tradition of spiritual mentorship, and in the year 1860 AD joined the [[Medical College and Hospital, Kolkata|Calcutta Medical College]] to pursue a career in medicine. During those times, [[white supremacy]] was very much prevalent in [[British India]]. Infuriated by the racist comments made by a British professor, Gosaiji organised the first student strike in British India. The mediation of [[Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar|Sri Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar]] brought the situation under control, but a disillusioned Gosaiji left his studies at the medical college and instead became a [[Homeopathy|homoeopathy]] medicine practitioner. During his wanderings as a [[Homeopathy|homoeopathy]] doctor, Gosaiji's religion fervour grew and under the influence of [[Debendranath Tagore|Acharya Devendra Nath Tagore]], he renounced his Hindu heritage and joined the [[Brahmo Samaj]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Keshab Chandra Sen]]\n*[[Debendranath Tagore]]\n*[[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]]\n*[[Advaita Acharya]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.gosaiji.com/ Sadguru Shree Shree Bijoy Krishna Goswami (Gosaiji)]\n* [http://www.sadgurubijoykrishna.com/sadguru_bijoy_krishna_goswami.html Biography - Bijoy Krishna Goswami]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Goswami, Bijoy Krishna}}\n[[Category:1841 births]]\n[[Category:1899 deaths]]\n[[Category:19th-century Hindu religious leaders]]\n[[Category:Bengali Hindus]]\n[[Category:Bhakti movement]]\n[[Category:Bengali people]]\n[[Category:Hindu revivalists]]\n[[Category:Hindu reformers]]\n[[Category:Indian Hindu monks]]\n[[Category:Indian Hindu religious leaders]]\n[[Category:Indian social reformers]]\n[[Category:Sanskrit College alumni]]\n[[Category:University of Calcutta alumni]]\n[[Category:Activists from West Bengal]]\n[[Category:Hindu saints]]\n\n{{Hindu-bio-stub}}\n", "text_old": "\n\n{{EngvarB|date=February 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2015}}\n\n<br /> \n{{Infobox Hindu leader\n|name           = Bijoy Krishna Goswami \n|image          = Vijay-krishna-gosvami2.jpg\n|caption        = Image of Bijoy Krishna Goswami\n| religion = [[Hinduism]]\n|birth_date     = 2nd August,1841\n|birth_place    = Shikarpur,[[Nadia]], [[Bengal Presidency|Bengal]], [[British India]]\n|birth_name     =<!-- name before becoming a religious teacher -->\n|death_date     = June,1899\n|death_place    =[[Puri]],[[Orissa Province]],[[British India]]\n|guru           =Srimat Brahmananda Paramahamsa\n|disciple       =Brahmachari Kuladananda, Kiran Chandra Darbesh ji\n|philosophy     =[[Vedanta]], [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]], [[Bhakti Yoga]]\n|honors         =Sadhguru\n|founder        =<!-- Sects/Traditions/Institutions founded by the Hindu leader-->\n|sect = <!-- Sects/Traditions associated with the Hindu leader-->\n|literary_works = <!-- Preferably having pages on wikipedia and wikisource--> \n|influenced     =[[Bipin Chandra Pal]],[[Ashwini Kumar Dutta]],[[Satish Chandra Mukherjee]]\n|signature      =<!--Preferably uploaded on wikipedia commons-->\n|signature_alt  =\n|footnotes      =\n}}\n\n'''Bijoy Krishna Goswami''' ({{lang-bn|\u09ac\u09bf\u099c\u09af\u09bc \u0995\u09c3\u09b7\u09cd\u09a3 \u0997\u09cb\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09be\u09ae\u09c0}}) (2 August 1841 \u2013 1899)<ref name=\"Jones1990\">{{cite book|author=Kenneth W.

During his Leela at [[Nabadwip]], Lord Sri [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] was travelling towards Sri [[Vrindavan]] in divine ecstasy, Srila [[Nitai]], however, diverted the lord from Sri [[Vrindavan]] and took him to Sripad [[Advaita Acharya]]'s residence, in [[Shantipur]]. Lord [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] stayed in [[Shantipur]] for ten days and then ignoring the tearful eyes of [[Shantipur]]'s residents and grief-stricken requests from his mother, [https://gaudiyahistory.iskcondesiretree.com/saci-devi/ Sachi Devi]; He left [[Shantipur]] for [[Jagannath Temple, Puri]]. [[Advaita Acharya]] could not bear the pangs of separation from Mahaprabhu, and in anticipation of parting, Adwaitya Acharya in a fit of grief cursed Mahaprabhu saying - \"You have stayed here for ten days, but in this incarnation, your work will remain incomplete, you have to re-incarnate in my family as my tenth generation.\"\n\nMahaprabhu re-appeared in Shantipur as a tenth generation successor of Sripad Adwaitya Acharya as Prabhupad Sri Sri Bijoy Krishna Goswami.\n\n== Early Life ==\nPrabhupad Sri Bijoy Krishna Goswami (Gosaiji) was born on 2nd August 1841 Shikarpur ([[Nadia district|Nadia]]), to Ananda Kishore Goswami and Swarnamoyee Devi. Desirous of a child, Ananda Kishore Goswami Prabhu travelled from [[Shantipur]] to [[Jagannath Temple, Puri]], performing [[Prostration (Buddhism)|dandavat prostration]] all along the way. This method of travelling took him one and a half year to reach [[Puri]]. The night he arrived at the [[Jagannath Temple, Puri]], he dreamt of [[Jagannath]] Swami, who promised him that he would take birth as his son. Thus, assured Ananda Kishore Goswami returned home to [[Shantipur]]. It is a typical pattern for saints to be born outside the confines of homes. [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] was born under a [[Azadirachta indica|neem]] tree, [[Jesus|Lord Jesus Christ]] was born in a manger, and [[Gautama Buddha]] was born in [[Lumbini]] garden likewise Gosaiji too was born in a [[colocasia]] thicket at Shikarpur (Nadia). \n\nThe family deity worshipped in the Goswami household was [https://iskconvrindavan.com/2019/08/01/shyamsundar-the-reservoir-of-all-beauty/ Sri Shyamsundar]. Shyamsundar would appear before Gosaiji and became a playmate of the infant Gosaiji. This ''[[Bhava|sakhyabh\u0101va]] (''the attitude of a friend) with Shyamsundar would remain with Gosaiji throughout in his life. \n\nAnanda Kishore Goswami passed away on 1844 AD, entering into [[Bhava samadhi|maha bhava samadhi]] while reciting the [[Bhagavata Purana|Srimad Bhagavatam]]; Gosaiji was then only three years old. Goswamiji started his academic life in 1850 AD, enrolling in the Bhagwan Sarkar's [[Sanskrit]] school at Shikarpur. He also studied [[Vedanta]] under the tutelage of Acharya Krishna Gopal Goswami. He later joined the [[The Sanskrit College and University|Calcutta Sanskrit College]], during this time he married Ramchandra Bhaduri's eldest daughter Yogmaya Devi. It was a tradition in the Goswami family of becoming hereditary spiritual preceptor of devoted families. In keeping with the culture, Gosaiji once visited the family of a disciple, who begged him for redemption. Gosaiji was shocked; he thought - ''\"How can I provide salvation when I am myself bound to [[Sa\u1e43s\u0101ra]]?\" ;'' Gosaiji consequently, left the ancestral tradition of spiritual mentorship, and in the year 1860 AD joined the [[Medical College and Hospital, Kolkata|Calcutta Medical College]] to pursue a career in medicine. During those times, [[white supremacy]] was very much prevalent in [[British India]]. Infuriated by the racist comments made by a British professor, Gosaiji organised the first student strike in British India. The mediation of [[Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar|Sri Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar]] brought the situation under control, but a disillusioned Gosaiji left his studies at the medical college and instead became a [[Homeopathy|homoeopathy]] medicine practitioner. During his wanderings as a [[Homeopathy|homoeopathy]] doctor, Gosaiji's religion fervour grew and under the influence of [[Debendranath Tagore|Acharya Devendra Nath Tagore]], he renounced his Hindu heritage and joined the [[Brahmo Samaj]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Keshab Chandra Sen]]\n*[[Debendranath Tagore]]\n*[[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]]\n*[[Advaita Acharya]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.gosaiji.com/ Sadguru Shree Shree Bijoy Krishna Goswami (Gosaiji)]\n* [http://www.sadgurubijoykrishna.com/sadguru_bijoy_krishna_goswami.html Biography - Bijoy Krishna Goswami]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Goswami, Bijoy Krishna}}\n[[Category:1841 births]]\n[[Category:1899 deaths]]\n[[Category:19th-century Hindu religious leaders]]\n[[Category:Bengali Hindus]]\n[[Category:Bhakti movement]]\n[[Category:Bengali people]]\n[[Category:Hindu revivalists]]\n[[Category:Hindu reformers]]\n[[Category:Indian Hindu monks]]\n[[Category:Indian Hindu religious leaders]]\n[[Category:Indian social reformers]]\n[[Category:Sanskrit College alumni]]\n[[Category:University of Calcutta alumni]]\n[[Category:Activists from West Bengal]]\n[[Category:Hindu saints]]\n\n{{Hindu-bio-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Gosaigon", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijoy_Krishna_Goswami"}

Business jets may be adapted for other roles, such as the evacuation of casualties or express parcel deliveries, and some are used by public bodies, [[government official]]s or the [[armed forces]].\n\n== History ==\n===Early developments===\nThe first small jet-powered civil aircraft was the [[Morane-Saulnier MS.760 Paris]], developed privately in the early 1950s from the [[Morane-Saulnier MS.755 Fleuret|MS.755 Fleuret]] two-seat [[jet trainer]]. First flown in 1954, the MS.760 Paris differs from subsequent business jets in having only four seats arranged in two rows without a center aisle, similar to a [[light aircraft]], under a large sliding [[canopy (aircraft)|canopy]] similar to that of a [[fighter aircraft|fighter]]. A U.S. [[type certificate]] was awarded in July 1958, but commercial sales were limited, with most examples going to the military; an improved civil version similar to a modern [[very light jet]], with a 6-seat enclosed cabin and a conventional door, never proceeded past the prototype stage.<ref name=GA_2010>{{cite magazine |last=Jerram |first=Mike |date=October 2010 |title=Morane-Saulnier Paris: the very first Very Light Jet |url=http://www.iaopa.eu/mediaServlet/storage/gamag/oct10/p42-45.pdf |magazine=General Aviation |publisher=International Council of Aircraft Owners and Pilots Associations |access-date=17 April 2020 }}</ref> The commercial failure of the MS.760 Paris prompted the cancellation of projects by [[Cessna]] and [[Douglas Aircraft]] to market similar jets.<ref name=Flying1987/>\n\nThe development of center-aisle cabin business jets was accelerated by an August 1956 [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) letter of requirement for two \"[[Commercial off-the-shelf|off-the-shelf]]\" aircraft: the larger UCX (cargo) and smaller UTX (trainer). These requirements differed from standard Air Force procurement contracts in that there would be no formal competitions, and manufacturers were expected to develop the aircraft without government funds; despite this, a substantial USAF purchase would offset the large investment necessary to develop prototypes.

[[Ford Motor Company]], [[Chrysler]], and [[Altria]] are examples of companies that own, maintain and operate their own fleet of private aircraft for their employees. Flight departments handle all aspects of aircraft operation and maintenance. In the United States, flight-department aircraft operate under [[Federal Aviation Regulations#Organization|FAR 91]] operating rules.\n\nA 2010 study by the United States [[National Business Aviation Association]] found that small and midsize companies that use private jets produce a 219% higher earnings growth rate than those that strictly use airlines.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.nbaa.org/business-aviation/NEXA-Report-Part-2-2010.pdf |title= Business aviation : an enterprise value perspective |publisher= [[National Business Aviation Association]] |date= Fall 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Charter companies===\nCharter operators own or manage private jets for multiple clients. Like traditional flight departments, charter companies handle all aspects of aircraft operation and maintenance. However, they are not aligned with just one corporation. They manage aircraft for a private owner or corporation and also handle the sales of available flight time on the aircraft they own or manage. Maintenance services can also be provided.\n\nIn the United States, business aircraft may be operated under either FAR 91 as private operations for the business purposes of the owner, or under [[Federal Aviation Regulations#Organization|FAR 135]] of the Federal Aviation Regulations as commercial operations for the business purposes of a third party. One common arrangement for operational flexibility purposes is for the aircraft's owner to operate the aircraft under FAR 91 when needed for its own purposes, and to allow a third-party charter-manager to operate it under FAR 135 when the aircraft is needed for the business purposes of third parties (such as for other entities within the corporate group of the aircraft's owner).<ref>{{cite web|last=Epstein|first=Jonathan M.|title=Placing Your Aircraft With An Aircraft Charter-Management Company|url=http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/266322/Aviation/Placing+Your+Aircraft+with+an+Aircraft&email_access=on|publisher=[[Holland & Knight]]|accessdate=4 October 2013|date=1 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nAircraft charter brokers have entered the marketplace through the ease of setting up a website and business online. Aircraft charter operators are legally responsible for the safe operation of aircraft and charter brokers require no economic authority and are largely unregulated. The [[Department of Transportation]] requires that air charter brokers disclose to the consumer that they do not operate aircraft and cannot use terms like \"our fleet of aircraft\", \"we operate\", \"our charter service\" and others.<ref>{{cite web|title=THE ROLE OF AIR CHARTER BROKERS IN ARRANGING AIR TRANSPORTATION|url=https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/docs/BrokerNoticeFinal%20Guidance.pdf|website=Department of Transportation|publisher=Department of Transportation}}</ref>\n\n===Fractional ownership===\nSince 1996 the term \"fractional jet\" has been used in connection with business aircraft owned by a consortium of companies. Under such arrangements, overhead costs such as [[aircrew member|flight crew]], hangarage and maintenance are split among the users.\n\n[[Fractional ownership of aircraft]] involves an individual or corporation that pays an upfront equity share for the cost of an aircraft. If four parties are involved, a partner would pay one-fourth of the aircraft price (a \"quarter share\"). That partner is now an equity owner in that aircraft and can sell the equity position if necessary. This also entitles the new owner to a certain number of hours of flight time on that aircraft, or any comparable aircraft in the fleet. Additional fees include monthly management fees and incidentals such as catering and ground transportation. In the United States, fractional-ownership operations may be regulated by either FAA [[Part 91 operator|part 91 or part 135]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Rules of the Game |url=https://www.bjtonline.com/business-jet-news/the-rules-of-the-game |website=Business Jet Traveler |publisher=Business Jet Traveler |accessdate=17 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Surveillance ===\n\nWith smaller equipment, long-range business aircraft can be modified as [[surveillance aircraft]] to perform specialized missions cost-effectively, from ground surveillance to maritime patrol:<ref>{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/business-aviation/spotlight-bizjet-based-special-mission-aircraft |title= Spotlight on Bizjet-based Special Mission Aircraft |date= 10 January 2018 |author= Graham Warwick |work= Aviation Week & Space Technology}}</ref>\n* the {{cvt|99,500|lb}}, 6,000 nmi [[Bombardier Global 6000]] is the platform for the USAF [[Northrop Grumman E-11]]A Battlefield Airborne Communications Node, the radar-carrying ground-surveillance [[Raytheon Sentinel]] for the [[UK Royal Air Force]], and Saab's [[Globaleye]] AEW&C carrying its [[Erieye]] AESA radar as UK's [[Marshall ADG]] basis for [[Elint]]/[[Sigint]] for the [[United Arab Emirates]]; it is also the base for the proposed [[Saab AB]] Swordfish MPA and the USAF [[Lockheed Martin]] [[JSTARS#Future|J-Stars Recap]] battlefield-surveillance program, while [[Israel Aerospace Industries|IAI]]'s ELI-3360 [[Maritime patrol aircraft|MPA]] is based on the Global 5000;\n* The {{cvt|91,000|lb}}, 6,750 nmi [[Gulfstream G550]] was selected for the [[IAI EL/W-2085]] Conformal Airborne Early Warning [[AESA radar]] for Italy, Singapore and Israel (which also has IAI Sigint G550s) while [[L3 Technologies]] transfers the U.S. [[Compass Call]] electronic-attack system to the G550 CAEW-based EC-37B, like the NC-37B range-support aircraft, and will modify others for Australia's {{abbr|AISREW|Airborne Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Electronic Warfare}} program, [[Northrop Grumman]] proposes the G550 for the J-Stars Recap;\n* Dassault Aviation developed the Falcon 900 MPA and Falcon 2000 Maritime Multirole Aircraft for France (which delayed its Avsimar requirement), South Korea and the [[Japan Coast Guard]] with a mission system developed with L3 and [[Thales Group]];\n* Embraer delivered several EMB-145s as a platform for [[AEW&C]], MPA and multi-[[Military intelligence|intelligence]];\n\n==Classes==\nBusiness jets can be categorized according to their size.\n\n===Very light jets===\n{{main|Very light jet}}\n[[File:N816CW Cessna Citation Mustang (7534559132).jpg|thumb|The most-sold VLJ is the [[Cessna Citation Mustang]].]]\n\nThe [[very light jet]] (VLJ) is a classification initiated by the release of the [[Eclipse 500]],<ref name=JA/><ref name=AC/><ref name=FMvlj/> on 31 December 2006, which was originally available at around US$1.5 million, cheaper than existing business jets and comparable with turboprop aircraft.

small groups of people. Business jets may be adapted for other roles, such as the evacuation of casualties or express parcel deliveries, and some are used by public bodies, [[government official]]s or the [[armed forces]].\n\n== History ==\n===Early developments===\nThe first small jet-powered civil aircraft was the [[Morane-Saulnier MS.760 Paris]], developed privately in the early 1950s from the [[Morane-Saulnier MS.755 Fleuret|MS.755 Fleuret]] two-seat [[jet trainer]]. First flown in 1954, the MS.760 Paris differs from subsequent business jets in having only four seats arranged in two rows without a center aisle, similar to a [[light aircraft]], under a large sliding [[canopy (aircraft)|canopy]] similar to that of a [[fighter aircraft|fighter]]. A U.S. [[type certificate]] was awarded in July 1958, but commercial sales were limited, with most examples going to the military; an improved civil version similar to a modern [[very light jet]], with a 6-seat enclosed cabin and a conventional door, never proceeded past the prototype stage.<ref name=GA_2010>{{cite magazine |last=Jerram |first=Mike |date=October 2010 |title=Morane-Saulnier Paris: the very first Very Light Jet |url=http://www.iaopa.eu/mediaServlet/storage/gamag/oct10/p42-45.pdf |magazine=General Aviation |publisher=International Council of Aircraft Owners and Pilots Associations |access-date=17 April 2020 }}</ref> The commercial failure of the MS.760 Paris prompted the cancellation of projects by [[Cessna]] and [[Douglas Aircraft]] to market similar jets.<ref name=Flying1987/>\n\nThe development of center-aisle cabin business jets was accelerated by an August 1956 [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) letter of requirement for two \"off-the-shelf\" aircraft: the larger UCX (cargo) and smaller UTX (trainer). These requirements differed from standard Air Force procurement contracts in that there would be no formal competitions, and manufacturers were expected to develop the aircraft without government funds; despite this, a substantial USAF purchase would offset the large investment necessary to develop prototypes. The [[Lockheed Corporation]] and [[McDonnell Aircraft]] both began development of UCX aircraft, while [[North American Aviation]] pursued the UTX requirement.<ref name=Flying1987>{{cite news |last=Peter |first=Garrison |title=BABY BIZJET BOOM: The birth of the light jet. |work=[[Flying (magazine)|Flying]] |date=September 1987 |pages=124\u2013126 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Off-The-Shelf Jets |work=[[Flying (magazine)|Flying]] |date=May 1959 |pages=26\u201327, 79 }}</ref>\n\n=== 1950s first flight ===\nThe [[Morane-Saulnier MS.760 Paris]] had a [[aircraft gross weight|gross weight]] of {{convert|7650|lb|t}}, initially powered by two [[Turbom\u00e9ca Marbor\u00e9]] [[turbojet]]s of {{convert|880|lbf|kN}} thrust, although most aircraft were later upgraded to {{convert|1058|lbf|kN}} units. The aircraft seated a single pilot and up to three passengers under a sliding canopy, and was first flown on 29 July 1954. 219 were built.\n\n[[File:NASA JetStar.jpg|thumb|The [[Lockheed JetStar]] is the earliest business jet with a center aisle]]\n\nThe [[Lockheed JetStar]], designed to meet USAF UCX requirements and seating ten passengers and two crew, first flew on 4 September 1957. A total of 204 aircraft were produced from 1957 to 1978 powered by several different engines; four {{convert|3300|lbf|kN}} [[Pratt & Whitney JT12]] [[turbojet]]s, then [[Garrett TFE731]] turbofans for a {{convert|44500|lb|t}} [[MTOW]], then two [[General Electric CF700]] turbofans.\n\nThe smaller, {{convert|17760|lb|t}} MTOW [[North American Sabreliner]], tailored to the USAF UTX requirement, first flew on 16 September 1958. Powered by two [[Pratt & Whitney JT12]] turbojet engines then [[Garrett TFE731]]s, more than 800 were produced from 1959 to 1982.\n\nDesigned in 1957 for the UCX requirement, the [[McDonnell 119]] was delayed by the cancellation of the [[Fairchild J83]] engine program, and first flew on 11 February 1959 powered by four [[Westinghouse J34]] turbojets. The 119 was certified for a {{convert|45328|lb|t|1}} MTOW with four Pratt & Whitney JT12 or General Electric CF700 engines, but no firm orders were received, and only the single prototype was completed.<ref name=Francillon1990>{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Francillon |first=Ren\u00e9 |date=1990 |title=McDonnell Douglas Aircraft Since 1920 |volume=II  |location=Annapolis, Maryland |publisher=Naval Institute Press |pages=241\u2013243 |isbn=1-55750-550-0 }}</ref>\n\n=== 1960s first flight ===\n[[File:Air Zoo Learjet II.JPG|thumb|The 1963 [[Learjet 23]] was the first light jet.]]\n[[File:Grumman G-1159 Gulfstream II-SP AN0489926.jpg|thumb|The first large, long range jet was the [[Grumman Gulfstream II]] in 1966.]]\n\nThe {{convert|25000|lb|t}} MTOW [[British Aerospace 125]] first flew on 13 August 1962 as the de Havilland DH.125, powered by two {{convert|3000|lbf|kN}}  [[Armstrong Siddeley Viper]] turbojets. Its engines were replaced by Garrett TFE731s, then [[Pratt & Whitney Canada PW300]] turbofans. Almost 1,700 aircraft of all variants, including the [[Hawker 800]], were produced between 1962 and 2013.\n\nThe Aero Commander 1121 Jet Commander, which later became the [[IAI Westwind]], first flew on 27 January 1963, powered by two [[General Electric CJ610]] turbojets, then [[Garrett TFE731]]s. Production of Jet Commanders and Westwinds from 1965 to 1987 came to 442 aircraft; and it was developed as the [[IAI Astra]], later re-branded as the [[Gulfstream G100]].\n\nThe {{convert|29,000|lb|t}} MTOW [[Dassault Falcon 20]] first flew on 4 May 1963, powered by two [[General Electric CF700]]s, then [[Garrett ATF3]] turbofans and [[Garrett TFE731]]s. A total of 508 were built from 1963 to 1988, and it is the basis of the [[Dassault Falcon]] family.\n\nThe first light jet first flew on 7 October 1963 : the [[Learjet 23]]. Powered by two {{convert|2,850|lbf|kN}} [[General Electric CJ610]]s, its {{convert|12,500|lb|t}} MTOW complies with [[FAR Part 23]] regulations. The first member of the [[Learjet]] family, 104 were built between 1962 and 1966.\n\nThe forward wing sweep, {{convert|20,280|lb|t}} MTOW [[Hamburger Flugzeugbau HFB 320 Hansa Jet]] first flew on 21 April 1964, powered by two General Electric CJ610s; 47 were built between 1965 and 1973.\nThe joint Piaggo-Douglas, {{convert|18,000|lb|t}} MTOW [[Piaggio PD.808]] first flew on 29 August 1964, powered by two [[Armstrong Siddeley Viper]]s, 24 were built for the Italian Air Force.\n\nOn 2 October 1966 the first large business jet first flew, the {{convert|65,500|lb|t}} MTOW [[Grumman Gulfstream II]], powered by two {{convert|11,400|lbf|kN}} [[Rolls-Royce Spey]] turbofans. From 1967 to the late 70s, 258 were built and it led to the ongoing [[Gulfstream Aerospace]] long range family.\n\nThe {{convert|11,850|lb|t}} MTOW [[Cessna Citation I]] first flew on 15 September 1969, powered by two {{convert|2,200|lbf|kN}} [[Pratt & Whitney Canada JT15D]] turbofans. Produced between 1969 and 1985 for a total of 689 examples, it is the first of the [[Cessna Citation family]].\n\n=== 1970s first flight ===\n\nThe trijet [[Dassault Falcon 50]] made its first flight on 7 November 1976. The {{convert|40000|lb|t}} MTOW airplane is powered by three {{convert|3700|lbf|kN}} TFE731 engines. With the cross-section of the Falcon 20, it is the basis of the larger [[Falcon 900]].\n\nOn 8 November 1978, the prototype [[Canadair Challenger]] took off. The {{convert|43000|-|48000|lb|t}} MTOW craft, usually powered by two {{convert|9200|lbf|kN}} [[General Electric CF34]]s, formed the basis of the long range [[Bombardier Global Express]] family and of the [[Bombardier CRJ]] regional airliners. The 1000th Challenger entered service in 2015.\n\nOn 30 May 1979 the clean-sheet {{convert|22,000|lb|t}} MTOW [[Cessna Citation III]] took off for the first time, powered by two {{convert|3,650|lbf|kN}} TFE731s.\n\nThe [[Mitsubishi MU-300 Diamond]] made its first flight on 29 August 1978. The {{convert|16,100|lb|t}} MTOW jet was powered by two {{convert|2,900|lbf|kN}} [[JT15D]]. The design was later sold and was renamed Beechjet 400 then [[Hawker 400]], with a total of 950 produced of all variants.\n\n=== 1980s first flight ===\n\nThe 1980s only saw the introduction of derivatives and no major new designs. Also there was an advent of fractional ownership in the late 1980s for business jets.<ref>{{cite web |title=Business jet travel for the masses could come from Uber-like concept. |url=https://www.kansas.com/news/business/aviation/article120969743.html |website=Wichita Eagle |publisher=Wichita Eagle |accessdate=17 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== 1990s first flight ===\n\nThe first flight of the clean-sheet [[Learjet 45]] was on 7 October 1995. All of the 642 aircraft built since then have been powered by two {{convert|3,500|lbf|kN}} TFE731 engines.\n\nPowered by two {{convert|2,300|lbf|kN}} [[Williams FJ44]]s, the {{convert|12,500|lb|t}} [[Beechcraft Premier I]] light jet made its first flight on 22 December 1998. Nearly 300 had been made before production stopped in 2013.\n\n=== 2000s first flight ===\n\nIn the opposite way compared to Bombardier, which developed airliners from a business jet, Embraer derived the [[Legacy 600]] from the [[Embraer ERJ family]] of regional jet airliners. Powered by two {{convert|39.2|kN|lbf|order=flip}} [[Rolls-Royce AE 3007]]s, the first flight of the {{convert|22.5|t|lb|order=flip}} aircraft was on 31 March 2001.\n\nOn 14 August 2001, the [[Bombardier Challenger 300]] made its first flight. The {{convert|38,850|lb|t}} aircraft is powered by two {{convert|6,825|lbf|kN}} [[HTF7000]]s. The 500th example was delivered in 2015.\n\nThe first very light jet, the {{convert|5,950|lb|t}} MTOW [[Eclipse 500]], took off for the first time on 26 August 2002, powered by two {{convert|900|lbf|kN}} [[Pratt & Whitney Canada PW600]]s. Between then and the end of production in 2008, 260 were produced.\n\nIt was followed by the {{convert|8645|lb|t}} MTOW [[Cessna Citation Mustang]] on 23 April 2005, powered by two {{convert|1460|lbf|kN}} Pratt & Whitney Canada PW600s and with more than 450 produced.\n\nThen the [[Embraer Phenom 100]] made its maiden flight on 26 July 2007. The {{convert|4.75|t|lb|order=flip}} MTOW airplane is powered by two {{convert|7.2|kN|lbf|order=flip}} Pratt & Whitney Canada PW600s. With its [[Phenom 300]] development, nearly 600 have been built.\n\n=== 2010s first flight ===\n\nThe first flight of the midsize, [[fly-by-wire]], {{cvt|7,000|lbf|kN}} [[Honeywell HTF7000]]-powered [[Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600|Embraer Legacy 500]] was on 27 November 2012.

[[Ford Motor Company]], [[Chrysler]], and [[Altria]] are examples of companies that own, maintain and operate their own fleet of private aircraft for their employees. Flight departments handle all aspects of aircraft operation and maintenance. In the United States, flight-department aircraft operate under [[Federal Aviation Regulations#Organization|FAR 91]] operating rules.\n\nA 2010 study by the United States [[National Business Aviation Association]] found that small and midsize companies that use private jets produce a 219% higher earnings growth rate than those that strictly use airlines.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.nbaa.org/business-aviation/NEXA-Report-Part-2-2010.pdf |title= Business aviation : an enterprise value perspective |publisher= [[National Business Aviation Association]] |date= Fall 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Charter companies===\nCharter operators own or manage private jets for multiple clients. Like traditional flight departments, charter companies handle all aspects of aircraft operation and maintenance. However, they are not aligned with just one corporation. They manage aircraft for a private owner or corporation and also handle the sales of available flight time on the aircraft they own or manage. Maintenance services can also be provided.\n\nIn the United States, business aircraft may be operated under either FAR 91 as private operations for the business purposes of the owner, or under [[Federal Aviation Regulations#Organization|FAR 135]] of the Federal Aviation Regulations as commercial operations for the business purposes of a third party. One common arrangement for operational flexibility purposes is for the aircraft's owner to operate the aircraft under FAR 91 when needed for its own purposes, and to allow a third-party charter-manager to operate it under FAR 135 when the aircraft is needed for the business purposes of third parties (such as for other entities within the corporate group of the aircraft's owner).<ref>{{cite web|last=Epstein|first=Jonathan M.|title=Placing Your Aircraft With An Aircraft Charter-Management Company|url=http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/266322/Aviation/Placing+Your+Aircraft+with+an+Aircraft&email_access=on|publisher=[[Holland & Knight]]|accessdate=4 October 2013|date=1 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nAircraft charter brokers have entered the marketplace through the ease of setting up a website and business online. Aircraft charter operators are legally responsible for the safe operation of aircraft and charter brokers require no economic authority and are largely unregulated. The [[Department of Transportation]] requires that air charter brokers disclose to the consumer that they do not operate aircraft and cannot use terms like \"our fleet of aircraft\", \"we operate\", \"our charter service\" and others.<ref>{{cite web|title=THE ROLE OF AIR CHARTER BROKERS IN ARRANGING AIR TRANSPORTATION|url=https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/docs/BrokerNoticeFinal%20Guidance.pdf|website=Department of Transportation|publisher=Department of Transportation}}</ref>\n\n===Fractional ownership===\nSince 1996 the term \"fractional jet\" has been used in connection with business aircraft owned by a consortium of companies. Under such arrangements, overhead costs such as [[aircrew member|flight crew]], hangarage and maintenance are split among the users.\n\n[[Fractional ownership of aircraft]] involves an individual or corporation that pays an upfront equity share for the cost of an aircraft. If four parties are involved, a partner would pay one-fourth of the aircraft price (a \"quarter share\"). That partner is now an equity owner in that aircraft and can sell the equity position if necessary. This also entitles the new owner to a certain number of hours of flight time on that aircraft, or any comparable aircraft in the fleet. Additional fees include monthly management fees and incidentals such as catering and ground transportation. In the United States, fractional-ownership operations may be regulated by either FAA [[Part 91 operator|part 91 or part 135]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Rules of the Game |url=https://www.bjtonline.com/business-jet-news/the-rules-of-the-game |website=Business Jet Traveler |publisher=Business Jet Traveler |accessdate=17 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Surveillance ===\n\nWith smaller equipment, long-range business aircraft can be modified as [[surveillance aircraft]] to perform specialized missions cost-effectively, from ground surveillance to maritime patrol:<ref>{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/business-aviation/spotlight-bizjet-based-special-mission-aircraft |title= Spotlight on Bizjet-based Special Mission Aircraft |date= 10 January 2018 |author= Graham Warwick |work= Aviation Week & Space Technology}}</ref>\n* the {{cvt|99,500|lb}}, 6,000 nmi [[Bombardier Global 6000]] is the platform for the USAF [[Northrop Grumman E-11]]A Battlefield Airborne Communications Node, the radar-carrying ground-surveillance [[Raytheon Sentinel]] for the [[UK Royal Air Force]], and Saab's [[Globaleye]] AEW&C carrying its [[Erieye]] AESA radar as UK's [[Marshall ADG]] basis for [[Elint]]/[[Sigint]] for the [[United Arab Emirates]]; it is also the base for the proposed [[Saab AB]] Swordfish MPA and the USAF [[Lockheed Martin]] [[JSTARS#Future|J-Stars Recap]] battlefield-surveillance program, while [[Israel Aerospace Industries|IAI]]'s ELI-3360 [[Maritime patrol aircraft|MPA]] is based on the Global 5000;\n* The {{cvt|91,000|lb}}, 6,750 nmi [[Gulfstream G550]] was selected for the [[IAI EL/W-2085]] Conformal Airborne Early Warning [[AESA radar]] for Italy, Singapore and Israel (which also has IAI Sigint G550s) while [[L3 Technologies]] transfers the U.S. [[Compass Call]] electronic-attack system to the G550 CAEW-based EC-37B, like the NC-37B range-support aircraft, and will modify others for Australia's {{abbr|AISREW|Airborne Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Electronic Warfare}} program, [[Northrop Grumman]] proposes the G550 for the J-Stars Recap;\n* Dassault Aviation developed the Falcon 900 MPA and Falcon 2000 Maritime Multirole Aircraft for France (which delayed its Avsimar requirement), South Korea and the [[Japan Coast Guard]] with a mission system developed with L3 and [[Thales Group]];\n* Embraer delivered several EMB-145s as a platform for [[AEW&C]], MPA and multi-[[Military intelligence|intelligence]];\n\n==Classes==\nBusiness jets can be categorized according to their size.\n\n===Very light jets===\n{{main|Very light jet}}\n[[File:N816CW Cessna Citation Mustang (7534559132).jpg|thumb|The most-sold VLJ is the [[Cessna Citation Mustang]].]]\n\nThe [[very light jet]] (VLJ) is a classification initiated by the release of the [[Eclipse 500]],<ref name=JA/><ref name=AC/><ref name=FMvlj/> on 31 December 2006, which was originally available at around US$1.5 million, cheaper than existing business jets and comparable with turboprop aircraft.
