In 2012 an even larger specimen was reported.\n\n==Description==\n \n''Sinocalliopteryx'' was a bipedal predator. The preserved length of the holotype specimen is 237 centimetres. Its weight was estimated by [[Gregory S. Paul]] in 2010 at twenty kilogrammes.<ref>Paul, G.S., 2010, ''The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs'', Princeton University Press p. 121</ref> ''Sinocalliopteryx'' is distinguished from ''Huaxiagnathus'', as well as other compsognathids, by its relatively long hands in relation to its arms. The arms and hindlimbs were also longer overall than in other compsognathids, a feature possibly related to its size.<ref name=\"jietall2007\"/>\n[[File:Sinocalliopteryx gigas.jpg|thumb|left|Restoration]]\n''Sinocalliopteryx'' had an elongated head with a pointed snout, showing a convex upper profile. There were four teeth in the [[premaxilla]] which were small but exceptionally had denticles on their front edges. Only six, larger, teeth were present in the [[maxilla]] of the [[holotype]] specimen but the number of its tooth positions could not be adequately determined. Specimen CAGS-IG-T1 preserves ten maxillary tooth sockets with room for one or two more in damaged areas. The [[jugal]] was a strongly built element with a high-rising front branch that formed part of the lower front edge of the eye socket. The lower jaw lacked an opening in its outer side.<ref name=\"jietall2007\"/><ref name=\"Xing2012\"/>\n\nThe vertebral column consisted of eleven cervical, twelve dorsal, five sacral and at least forty-nine caudal vertebrae. The point of the tail is missing. In the tail, the spines and chevrons strongly inclined to the back. The [[gastralia]] had very short lateral segments.<ref name=\"jietall2007\"/>\n\nThe arm had a short [[humerus]] and also the lower arm was short and elegant with an [[ulna]] showing only a weakly developed olecranon process on its back upper end. The hand was very elongated though, as long as the ulna and upper arm combined. The second [[metacarpal]] was expanded at the top at the side of the first metacarpal, making the entire [[metacarpus]] more compact. The second claw was elongated, as long as the thumb claw. The third metacarpal was rather short and carried a thin, third, finger.<ref name=\"jietall2007\"/>\n \nIn the pelvis there was a little notch in the front edge of the [[ilium (bone)|ilium]]. The relatively long shaft of the [[ischium]] curved downwards. The hindlimb was elongated, largely because of a long lower leg, having 90% of the length of the thighbone. The foot was also long, especially in the [[metatarsus]].<ref name=\"jietall2007\"/>\n\nLike many other [[theropod]]s of the Yixian Formation, ''Sinocalliopteryx'' was preserved with \"protofeathers,\" simple filamentous [[integument]] (hairlike structures covering the skin), very similar to that found in ''[[Sinosauropteryx]]''. The integument of ''Sinocalliopteryx'' differ in length across the body, with the longest protofeathers covering the hips, base of the tail, and back of the thighs. These longest protofeathers measured up to ten centimeters (4&nbsp;in) in length. Protofeathers were also found on the metatarsus (upper part of the foot). While these were not nearly as long or modern as the corresponding feathers of \"four-winged\" dinosaurs such as ''[[Microraptor]]'' and ''[[Pedopenna]]'', they do indicate that foot-feathers or similar structures first arose in dinosaurs much more basal or \"primitive\" than previously known.<ref name=\"jietall2007\"/>\n\n==Discovery and naming==\n[[File:Sinocalliopteryx.png|thumb|Specimen CAGS-IG-T1]] \nThe [[type species]] ''Sinocalliopteryx gigas'' was named and described in 2007 by [[Ji Shu'an]], [[Ji Qiang]], [[L\u00fc Junchang]] and [[Yuan Chongxi]].

Ji and colleagues in 2007 suggested that this could indicate it preyed upon the smaller, bird-like dinosaur. This discovery indicated that ''Sinocalliopteryx'' may have been an agile, active, \"fierce\" predator, especially since other compsognathids have been found with (presumably fast-moving) lizards and small mammals in their abdominal cavities.<ref name=\"jietall2007\"/> In 2012 the dromaeosaurid was tentatively identified as an individual of ''[[Sinornithosaurus]]'' with a length of 1.2 metres (3.9&nbsp;ft). The 2012 study also reported newly discovered remains of prey animals. Above the dromaeosaurid leg, feathers are visible. Below it two clusters of digested food can be seen. It was suggested that the feathers had belonged to a bird and were with the leg still present in the [[stomach]]. The digested food would, using the preserved digestive tract of ''[[Scipionyx]]'' as a reference, have been positioned in the [[duodenum]].<ref name=\"Xing2012\"/> The C-shaped abdominal contents of this specimen appear to reflect of the original contour of the digestive tract.<ref>Dal Sasso C, Maganuco S (2011) Scipionyx samniticus (Theropoda: Compsognathidae) from the Lower Cretaceous of Italy; osteology, ontogenetic assessment, phylogeny, soft tissue anatomy taphonomy and palaeobiology.

The authors interpreted these as [[gastroliths]] ([[gizzard]] stones) similar to those found with ''[[Nqwebasaurus]]'' and ''[[Baryonyx]]''. Other theropods, such as ''[[Caudipteryx]]'' and a [[Mongolia]]n [[ornithomimid]], were also found with gastroliths, though in those cases the stones were much more numerous and smaller in size. Ji and colleagues speculated that, since the later two dinosaurs were probably primarily herbivores, the number and size of gastroliths may correspond with diet; that is, herbivores ingested many small stones, while carnivores ingested only a few larger stones to aid in digestion.<ref name=\"jietall2007\"/> However, the 2012 study could find no gastroliths with the second specimen and therefore concluded that the stones with the holotype were swallowed by accident. In any case no special [[gizzard]] would have been present.<ref name=\"Xing2012\"/>\n\nThe second specimen, CAGS-IG-T1, also preserves the remains of several meals. Disarticulated bones were found, in front of the lower ischia, identified as belonging to at least two individuals of ''[[Confuciusornis]] sanctus'', a basal bird that is very common in the formation. Also a 13.5 centimetres long scapula was discovered, belonging to some 1.5 metres (4.9&nbsp;ft) long herbivorous [[ornithischia]]n, perhaps ''[[Yueosaurus]]'' or a ''[[Psittacosaurus]]'' species. The bone surface of the scapula looked as if it had been etched by stomach acid for about thirteen days, leading to the conclusion the birds were swallowed later and in quick succession. This again would indicate a high metabolism for ''Sinocalliopteryx'', necessitating a regular food intake.<ref name=\"Xing2012\"/>\n\nThat the second specimen in a short period of time caught two birds, together with the bird feather remains in the holotype stomach, might be an indication that ''Sinocalliopteryx'' specialised in such prey. Even the ''Sinornithosaurus'' might conform to this pattern as the authors considered it a possibly volant form. In 2011 a specimen of ''[[Microraptor]]'' was reported with a bird in its stomach and seen as proof that the former were arboreal. The 2012 study denied the relevance of flying prey for this issue as ''Sinocalliopteryx'' was in all likelihood cursorial, or ground-dwelling, and yet apparently quite capable of catching birds, e.g. by using stealth attack, a method employed by many modern cursorial predators of fowl.<ref name=\"Xing2012\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Portal|Dinosaurs}}\n{{Theropoda|O.}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q133117}}\n\n[[Category:Compsognathids]]\n[[Category:Early Cretaceous dinosaurs of Asia]]\n[[Category:Yixian fauna]]\n[[Category:Feathered dinosaurs]]\n[[Category:Fossil taxa described in 2007]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by L\u00fc Junchang]]\n", "text_old": "{{speciesbox\n| fossil_range = [[Early Cretaceous]], {{fossil range|124.6}}\n| image = Holotype of Sinocalliopteryx gigas.png\n| image_caption = Holotype\n| genus = Sinocalliopteryx\n| parent_authority = Ji ''et al.'', 2007\n| species = gigas\n| authority = Ji ''et al.'', 2007\n}}\n\n'''''Sinocalliopteryx''''' (meaning 'Chinese beautiful feather') is a [[genus]] of carnivorous [[compsognathid]] [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]]s from the [[Lower Cretaceous]] [[Yixian Formation]] of [[China]] (Jianshangou Beds, dating to 124.6 Ma).\n\nWhile similar to the related ''[[Huaxiagnathus]]'', ''Sinocalliopteryx'' were larger.

It was the birthplace of [[Expressionism]] in painting and sculpture, of the [[Atonal music|atonal]] musical compositions of [[Arnold Schoenberg]], and the jazz-influenced work of [[Paul Hindemith]] and [[Kurt Weill]]. Films such as [[Robert Wiene]]'s ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920 film)|The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'' (1920) and [[F. W. Murnau]]'s ''[[Nosferatu (film)|Nosferatu]]'' (1922) brought Expressionism to [[Film|cinema]].\n\nThe Nazis viewed the culture of the [[Weimar Republic|Weimar period]] with disgust.

Modern art was [seen as] an act of aesthetic violence by the Jews against the German spirit. Such was true to Hitler even though only [[Max Liebermann|Liebermann]], [[Ludwig Meidner|Meidner]], [[Otto Freundlich|Freundlich]], and [[Marc Chagall]], among those who made significant contributions to the German modernist movement, were Jewish. But Hitler ... took upon himself the responsibility of deciding who, in matters of culture, thought and acted like a Jew.\"<ref>Grosshans 1983, p. 86.</ref>\n\nThe supposedly \"Jewish\" nature of all art that was indecipherable, distorted, or that represented \"depraved\" subject matter was explained through the concept of degeneracy, which held that distorted and corrupted art was a symptom of an inferior race. By propagating the theory of degeneracy, the Nazis combined their [[anti-Semitism]] with their drive to control the culture, thus consolidating public support for both campaigns.<ref>Barron 1991, p. 83.</ref>\n\n==Degeneracy==\n[[File:Barlach Magdeburger Ehrenmal.jpg|thumb|upright|{{lang|de|Das Magdeburger Ehrenmal}} (the Magdeburg cenotaph), by [[Ernst Barlach]] was declared to be degenerate art due to the \"deformity\" and emaciation of the figures\u2014corresponding to [[Max Nordau|Nordau's]] theorized connection between \"mental and physical degeneration\".]]\nThe term {{lang|de|Entartung}} (or [[Degeneration theory|\"degeneracy\"]]) had gained currency in Germany by the late 19th century when the critic and author [[Max Nordau]] devised the [[theory]] presented in his 1892 book ''[[Degeneration (Max Nordau)|Entartung]]''.<ref>Barron 1991, p. 26.</ref> Nordau drew upon the writings of the [[criminology|criminologist]] [[Cesare Lombroso]], whose ''The Criminal Man'', published in 1876, attempted to prove that there were \"born criminals\" whose [[atavism|atavistic]] personality traits could be detected by scientifically measuring abnormal physical characteristics. Nordau developed from this premise a critique of [[modern art]], explained as the work of those so corrupted and enfeebled by modern life that they have lost the self-control needed to produce coherent works. He attacked [[Aestheticism]] in [[English literature]] and described the [[mysticism]] of the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist movement]] in [[French literature]] as a product of mental pathology. Explaining the [[painterliness]] of [[Impressionism]] as the sign of a diseased visual cortex, he decried modern degeneracy while praising traditional German culture. Despite the fact that Nordau was Jewish and a key figure in the [[Zionist]] movement (Lombroso was also Jewish), his theory of artistic degeneracy would be seized upon by German [[Nazism|National Socialists]] during the [[Weimar Republic]] as a rallying point for their anti-Semitic and racist demand for [[Aryan race|Aryan]] purity in art.\n\nBelief in a Germanic spirit\u2014defined as mystical, rural, moral, bearing ancient wisdom, and noble in the face of a tragic destiny\u2014existed long before the rise of the Nazis; the composer [[Richard Wagner]] celebrated such ideas in his work.<ref>Adam 1992, pp. 23\u201324.</ref> Beginning before World War I, the well-known German architect and painter [[Paul Schultze-Naumburg]]'s influential writings, which invoked racial theories in condemning modern art and [[modern architecture|architecture]], supplied much of the basis for Adolf Hitler's belief that classical [[Greece]] and the [[Middle Ages]] were the true sources of Aryan art.<ref>Adam 1992, pp. 29\u201332.</ref> Schultze-Naumburg subsequently wrote such books as ''{{lang|de|Die Kunst der Deutschen. Ihr Wesen und ihre Werke}}'' (''The art of the Germans. Its nature and its works'') and ''{{lang|de|Kunst und Rasse}}'' (''Art and Race''), the latter published in 1928, in which he argued that only racially pure artists could produce a healthy art which upheld timeless [[Platonic idealism|ideals]] of [[classical beauty]], while racially mixed modern artists produced disordered artworks and monstrous depictions of the human form. By reproducing examples of modern art next to photographs of people with deformities and diseases, he graphically reinforced the idea of modernism as a sickness.<ref>Grosshans 1983, p. 9. Grosshans calls Schultze-Naumburg \"[u]ndoubtedly the most important\" of the era's German critics of modernism.</ref> [[Alfred Rosenberg]] developed this theory in ''{{lang|de|[[The Myth of the Twentieth Century|Der Mythos des 20.

Sub-chambers within the Culture Chamber, representing the individual arts (music, film, literature, architecture, and the visual arts) were created; these were membership groups consisting of \"racially pure\" artists supportive of the Party, or willing to be compliant. Goebbels made it clear: \"In future only those who are members of a chamber are allowed to be productive in our cultural life. Membership is open only to those who fulfill the entrance condition. In this way all unwanted and damaging elements have been excluded.\"<ref name=\"Adam 1992, p. 53\">Adam 1992, p. 53.</ref> By 1935 the Reich Culture Chamber had 100,000 members.<ref name=\"Adam 1992, p. 53\"/>\n\nNonetheless, during 1933\u20131934 there was some confusion within the Party on the question of [[German Expressionism|Expressionism]]. Goebbels and some others believed that the forceful works of such artists as [[Emil Nolde]], [[Ernst Barlach]] and [[Erich Heckel]] exemplified the Nordic spirit; as Goebbels explained, \"We National Socialists are not unmodern; we are the carrier of a new modernity, not only in politics and in social matters, but also in art and intellectual matters.\"<ref>Adam 1992, p. 56.</ref> However, a faction led by [[Alfred Rosenberg]] despised the Expressionists, and the result was a bitter ideological dispute, which was settled only in September 1934, when Hitler declared that there would be no place for modernist experimentation in the Reich.<ref>Grosshans 1983, pp. 73\u201374.</ref> This edict left many artists initially uncertain as to their status.

It was the birthplace of [[Expressionism]] in painting and sculpture, of the [[Atonal music|atonal]] musical compositions of [[Arnold Schoenberg]], and the jazz-influenced work of [[Paul Hindemith]] and [[Kurt Weill]]. Films such as [[Robert Wiene]]'s ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920 film)|The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'' (1920) and [[F. W. Murnau]]'s ''[[Nosferatu (film)|Nosferatu]]'' (1922) brought Expressionism to [[Film|cinema]].\n\nThe Nazis viewed the culture of the [[Weimar Republic|Weimar period]] with disgust. Their response stemmed partly from a conservative [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] taste and partly from their determination to use culture as a [[propaganda]] tool.<ref>Adam 1992, p. 110.</ref> On both counts, a painting such as [[Otto Dix]]'s ''War Cripples'' (1920) was anathema to them. It unsparingly depicts four badly disfigured veterans of the [[First World War]], then a familiar sight on [[Berlin]]'s streets, rendered in [[caricature]]d style.

Such was true to Hitler even though only [[Max Liebermann|Liebermann]], [[Ludwig Meidner|Meidner]], [[Otto Freundlich|Freundlich]], and [[Marc Chagall]], among those who made significant contributions to the German modernist movement, were Jewish. But Hitler ... took upon himself the responsibility of deciding who, in matters of culture, thought and acted like a Jew.\"<ref>Grosshans 1983, p. 86.</ref>\n\nThe supposedly \"Jewish\" nature of all art that was indecipherable, distorted, or that represented \"depraved\" subject matter was explained through the concept of degeneracy, which held that distorted and corrupted art was a symptom of an inferior race. By propagating the theory of degeneracy, the Nazis combined their [[anti-Semitism]] with their drive to control the culture, thus consolidating public support for both campaigns.<ref>Barron 1991, p. 83.</ref>\n\n==Degeneracy==\n[[File:Barlach Magdeburger Ehrenmal.jpg|thumb|upright|{{lang|de|Das Magdeburger Ehrenmal}} (the Magdeburg cenotaph), by [[Ernst Barlach]] was declared to be degenerate art due to the \"deformity\" and emaciation of the figures\u2014corresponding to [[Max Nordau|Nordau's]] theorized connection between \"mental and physical degeneration\".]]\nThe term {{lang|de|Entartung}} (or [[Degeneration theory|\"degeneracy\"]]) had gained currency in Germany by the late 19th century when the critic and author [[Max Nordau]] devised the [[theory]] presented in his 1892 book ''[[Degeneration (Max Nordau)|Entartung]]''.<ref>Barron 1991, p. 26.</ref> Nordau drew upon the writings of the [[criminology|criminologist]] [[Cesare Lombroso]], whose ''The Criminal Man'', published in 1876, attempted to prove that there were \"born criminals\" whose [[atavism|atavistic]] personality traits could be detected by scientifically measuring abnormal physical characteristics. Nordau developed from this premise a critique of [[modern art]], explained as the work of those so corrupted and enfeebled by modern life that they have lost the self-control needed to produce coherent works. He attacked [[Aestheticism]] in [[English literature]] and described the [[mysticism]] of the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist movement]] in [[French literature]] as a product of mental pathology. Explaining the [[painterliness]] of [[Impressionism]] as the sign of a diseased visual cortex, he decried modern degeneracy while praising traditional German culture. Despite the fact that Nordau was Jewish and a key figure in the [[Zionist]] movement (Lombroso was also Jewish), his theory of artistic degeneracy would be seized upon by German [[Nazism|National Socialists]] during the [[Weimar Republic]] as a rallying point for their anti-Semitic and racist demand for [[Aryan race|Aryan]] purity in art.\n\nBelief in a Germanic spirit\u2014defined as mystical, rural, moral, bearing ancient wisdom, and noble in the face of a tragic destiny\u2014existed long before the rise of the Nazis; the composer [[Richard Wagner]] celebrated such ideas in his work.<ref>Adam 1992, pp. 23\u201324.</ref> Beginning before World War I, the well-known German architect and painter [[Paul Schultze-Naumburg]]'s influential writings, which invoked racial theories in condemning modern art and [[modern architecture|architecture]], supplied much of the basis for Adolf Hitler's belief that classical [[Greece]] and the [[Middle Ages]] were the true sources of Aryan art.<ref>Adam 1992, pp. 29\u201332.</ref> Schultze-Naumburg subsequently wrote such books as ''{{lang|de|Die Kunst der Deutschen. Ihr Wesen und ihre Werke}}'' (''The art of the Germans. Its nature and its works'') and ''{{lang|de|Kunst und Rasse}}'' (''Art and Race''), the latter published in 1928, in which he argued that only racially pure artists could produce a healthy art which upheld timeless [[Platonic idealism|ideals]] of [[classical beauty]], while racially mixed modern artists produced disordered artworks and monstrous depictions of the human form. By reproducing examples of modern art next to photographs of people with deformities and diseases, he graphically reinforced the idea of modernism as a sickness.<ref>Grosshans 1983, p. 9. Grosshans calls Schultze-Naumburg \"[u]ndoubtedly the most important\" of the era's German critics of modernism.</ref> [[Alfred Rosenberg]] developed this theory in ''{{lang|de|[[The Myth of the Twentieth Century|Der Mythos des 20. Jahrhunderts]]}}'' (''Myth of the Twentieth Century''), published in 1933, which became a best-seller in Germany and made Rosenberg the Party's leading ideological spokesman.<ref>Adam 1992, p. 33.</ref>\n\n==Purge==\n[[File:Entartete musik poster.jpg|thumb|Cover of the exhibition program: ''[[Degenerate music]]'' exhibition, [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], 1938]]\nHitler's rise to power on January 31, 1933, was quickly followed by actions intended to cleanse the culture of degeneracy: [[book burning]]s were organized, artists and musicians were dismissed from teaching positions, and curators who had shown a partiality for modern art were replaced by Party members.<ref>Adam 1992, p. 52.</ref> In September 1933, the {{lang|de|[[Reichskulturkammer]]}} (Reich Culture Chamber) was established, with [[Joseph Goebbels]], Hitler's {{lang|de|Reichminister f\u00fcr Volksaufkl\u00e4rung und Propaganda}} (Reich Minister for Public Enlightenment and [[Propaganda]]) in charge. Sub-chambers within the Culture Chamber, representing the individual arts (music, film, literature, architecture, and the visual arts) were created; these were membership groups consisting of \"racially pure\" artists supportive of the Party, or willing to be compliant. Goebbels made it clear: \"In future only those who are members of a chamber are allowed to be productive in our cultural life. Membership is open only to those who fulfill the entrance condition. In this way all unwanted and damaging elements have been excluded.\"<ref name=\"Adam 1992, p. 53\">Adam 1992, p. 53.</ref> By 1935 the Reich Culture Chamber had 100,000 members.<ref name=\"Adam 1992, p. 53\"/>\n\nNonetheless, during 1933\u20131934 there was some confusion within the Party on the question of [[German Expressionism|Expressionism]]. Goebbels and some others believed that the forceful works of such artists as [[Emil Nolde]], [[Ernst Barlach]] and [[Erich Heckel]] exemplified the Nordic spirit; as Goebbels explained, \"We National Socialists are not unmodern; we are the carrier of a new modernity, not only in politics and in social matters, but also in art and intellectual matters.\"<ref>Adam 1992, p. 56.</ref> However, a faction led by [[Alfred Rosenberg]] despised the Expressionists, and the result was a bitter ideological dispute, which was settled only in September 1934, when Hitler declared that there would be no place for modernist experimentation in the Reich.<ref>Grosshans 1983, pp. 73\u201374.</ref> This edict left many artists initially uncertain as to their status. The work of the Expressionist painter Emil Nolde, a committed member of the Nazi party, continued to be debated even after he was ordered to cease artistic activity in 1936.<ref>Boa, Elizabeth, and Rachel Palfreyman (2000).

Viewers had to reach the exhibit by means of a narrow staircase. The first sculpture was an oversized, theatrical portrait of [[Jesus]], which purposely intimidated viewers as they literally bumped into it in order to enter. The rooms were made of temporary partitions and deliberately chaotic and overfilled. Pictures were crowded together, sometimes unframed, usually hung by cord.\n\nThe first three rooms were grouped thematically. The first room contained works considered demeaning of religion; the second featured works by Jewish artists in particular; the third contained works deemed insulting to the women, soldiers and farmers of Germany. The rest of the exhibit had no particular theme.\n\nThere were slogans painted on the walls.

Copies were made available to other libraries and research organisations at the time, and much of the information was subsequently incorporated into a database maintained by the Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin.<ref name=\"V&A Entartete Kunst webpage\">{{cite web |url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/entartetekunst |title=V&A Entartete Kunst webpage |publisher=Vam.ac.uk |date=1939-06-30 |accessdate=2014-08-14}}</ref><ref name=\"Free University of Berlin\">{{cite web|url=http://www.geschkult.fu-berlin.de/en/e/db_entart_kunst/index.html |title=Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin Database \"Entartete Kunst\" |publisher=Geschkult.fu-berlin.de |date=2013-08-28 |accessdate=2014-08-14}}</ref> \n\nA digital reproduction of the entire inventory was published on the Victoria and Albert Museum's website in January 2014. The V&A's publication consists of two [[PDF]]s, one for each of the original volumes. Both PDFs also include an introduction in English and German. <ref>[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/e/entartete-kunst/ Entartete Kunst], Victoria and Albert Museum. 2014.</ref> An online version of the inventory was made available on the V&A's website in November 2019, with additional features. The new edition uses [[IIIF]] page-turning software and incorporates an interactive index arranged by city and museum. The earlier PDF edition remains available too.<ref>[https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/explore-entartete-kunst-the-nazis-inventory-of-degenerate-art Explore 'Entartete Kunst': The Nazis' inventory of 'degenerate art'], Victoria and Albert Museum. 2019.</ref>\n\nThe V&A's copy of the full inventory is thought to have been compiled in 1941 or 1942, after the sales and disposals were completed.<ref>Victoria and Albert Museum 2014. Introduction by Douglas Dodds & Heike Zech, p. i.</ref> Two copies of an earlier version of Volume 1 (A\u2013G) also survive in the German Federal Archives in Berlin, and one of these is annotated to show the fate of individual artworks. Until the V&A obtained the complete inventory in 1996, all versions of Volume 2 (G\u2013Z) were thought to have been destroyed.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Victoria and Albert Museum 2014. Introduction by Douglas Dodds & Heike Zech, p. ii.</ref> The listings are arranged alphabetically by city, museum and artist. Details include artist surname, inventory number, title and medium, followed by a code indicating the fate of the artwork, then the surname of the buyer or art dealer (if any) and any price paid.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The entries also include abbreviations to indicate whether the work was included in any of the various {{lang|de|Entartete Kunst}} exhibitions (see [[Degenerate Art Exhibition]]) or {{lang|de|Der ewige Jude}} (see [[The Eternal Jew (art exhibition)]]).<ref>Victoria and Albert Museum 2014, vol. 1, p. 7.</ref>\n\nThe main dealers mentioned are Bernhard A. B\u00f6hmer (or Boehmer), Karl Buchholz, [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]], and Ferdinand M\u00f6ller (or Moeller). The manuscript also contains entries for many artworks acquired by the artist Emanuel Fohn, in exchange for other works.<ref>Victoria and Albert Museum 2014, vol. 1 and 2.</ref>\n\n== 21st-century reactions ==\nNeil Levi, writing in ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'', suggested that the branding of art as \"degenerate\" was only partly an aesthetic aim of the Nazis. Another was the confiscation of valuable artwork, a deliberate means to enrich the regime.<ref>Neil Levi, [http://chronicle.com/blogs/conversation/2013/11/12/the-uses-of-nazi-degenerate-art/ \"The Uses of Nazi \u2018Degenerate Art\u2019\"], ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' (Nov. 12, 2013).</ref>\n\n== In popular culture ==\n''[[A Picasso]]'', a play by [[Jeffrey Hatcher]] based loosely on actual events, is set in Paris 1941 and sees [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] being asked to authenticate three works for inclusion in an upcoming exhibition of Degenerate art.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://theater.nytimes.com/2005/04/20/theater/reviews/20PICA.html|title = Portrait of the Artist as a Master of the One-Liner|author = Isherwood, C.|date = April 20, 2005|accessdate = June 22, 2013|newspaper = [[The New York Times]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title = Ve haff vays of being unintentionally funny|date = October 3, 2012|accessdate = June 22, 2013|author = Blake, J.|url = http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/theatre/ve-haff-vays-of-being-unintentionally-funny-20121003-26yp9.html|newspaper = [[Sydney Morning Herald]]}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1964 film ''[[The Train (1964 film)|The Train]]'', a German Army colonel attempts to steal hundreds of \"degenerate\" paintings from Paris before it is liberated during World War II.<ref>{{cite news |title = Train, The (1965) \u2013 (Movie Clip) Degenerate Art |accessdate = February 15, 2015 |url = http://www.tcmclassicfilmfestival.com/mediaroom/video/476066/Train-The-Movie-Clip-Degenerate-Art.html |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150215233016/http://www.tcmclassicfilmfestival.com/mediaroom/video/476066/Train-The-Movie-Clip-Degenerate-Art.html |archive-date = February 15, 2015 |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Gurlitt Collection]]\n*[[Art of the Third Reich]]\n*[[Negermusik]]\n*[[Low culture]]\n*[[Reichsmusikkammer]]\n*[[Reich Music Examination Office]]\n*[[Nazi Plunder]]\n*[[Swing Kids]]\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* [[Peter Adam (filmmaker)|Adam, Peter]] (1992).
