In some [[Developing country|developing countries]], grain in the form of [[rice]], [[wheat]], [[millet]], or [[maize]] constitutes a majority of daily sustenance. In [[Developed country|developed countries]], cereal consumption is moderate and varied but still substantial.\n\nThe word ''cereal'' is derived from ''[[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]]'', the Roman goddess of harvest and agriculture.<ref name=\"spaeth\">{{cite book |last1=Spaeth |first1=Barbette Stanley |title=The Roman goddess Ceres |date=1996 |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=0292776934 |edition=1st }}</ref>\n\n==Ancient history==\n{{Further|Neolithic Revolution}}\n[[File:Trilla del trigo en el Antiguo Egipto.jpg|thumb|Threshing of grain in [[ancient Egypt]]]]\n[[File:Roman harvester, Trier.jpg|thumb|Roman harvesting machine]]\n\n[[Agriculture]] allowed for the support of an increased population, leading to larger societies and eventually the development of cities. It also created the need for greater organization of political power (and the creation of [[social stratification]]), as decisions had to be made regarding labor and harvest allocation and access rights to water and land. Agriculture bred immobility, as populations settled down for long periods of time, which led to the accumulation of material goods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://anthro.ucsd.edu/~dkjordan/arch/neolithic/Neo3-LivRev.html|title=Living the Revolution|author=DK Jordan|date=24 November 2012|work=The Neolithic|publisher=University of California \u2013 San Diego|accessdate=22 April 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029191022/http://anthro.ucsd.edu/~dkjordan/arch/neolithic/Neo3-LivRev.html|archivedate=29 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nEarly [[Neolithic]] villages show evidence of the development of processing grain.

[[Emmer|Emmer wheat]], [[einkorn wheat]], and [[barley]] were three of the so-called [[Neolithic founder crops]] in the development of agriculture. Around the same time, millets and rices were starting to become domesticated in East Asia. Sorghum and millets were also being domesticated in sub-Saharan West Africa.\n\n==Cereals and civilization==\nCereals were the foundation of human civilization. Cereal frontiers coincided with civilizational frontiers. The term [[Fertile Crescent]] explicitely implies the spatial dependence of civilization on cereals. [[The Great Wall]] of China and the [[Roman limes|Roman limes]] demarkated the same northern limit of the cereal cultivation. The [[Silk Road]] stretched along the cereal belt of Eurasia. Numerous Chinese imperial edicts stated: \u201cAgriculture is the foundation of this empire,\u201d<ref>Max Ostrovsky, ''The Hyperbola of the World Order'', Lanham: University Press of America, 2006, p 86.</ref> while the foundation of agriculture were the [[Five Grains]].  \n\nCereals determined how large and for how long an army could be mobilized. For this reason, [[Shang Yang]] called agriculture and war \u201cthe One.\u201d<ref>Ostrovsky 2006: p 62.</ref> [[Guan Zhong]], [[Chanakya]] (the author of ''[[Arthashastra]]'')<ref>Ostrovsky 2006: p 63-64.</ref> and [[Hannibal]]<ref>Ostrovsky 2006: p 85.</ref> expressed similar concepts. At the dawn of history, the Sumerians believed that if agriculture of a state declines, [[Inanna]], the goddess of war, leaves this state.<ref>Ostrovsky 2006: p 68.</ref> Several gods of antiquity combined the functions of what Shang Yang called \u201cthe One\u201d \u2013 agriculture and war: the Hittite [[Sun goddess of Arinna]], the Canaanite [[Lahmu]] and the Roman [[Janus]]. These were highly important gods in their time leaving their legacy until today. We still begin the year with the month of Janus (January). The Jews believe that Messiah will be born in the town of Lahmu ([[Bethlehem]]) and the Christians believe that he was already born there. Lahmu is the responsible why in Hebrew until today ''bread'' (''lehem'') and ''warfare'' (''lehima'') are of the same root.  In fact, most persistent and flourishing empires throughout history in both hemispheres were centered in regions fertile for cereals.\n\nHistorian Max Ostrovsky argues that this historic pattern never changed, not even in the [[Industrial Age]].<ref>Max Ostrovsky, ''The Hyperbola of the World Order'', Lanham: University Press of America, 2006, p 111-126.</ref> He stresses that all modern great powers have traditionally remained first and foremost great ''cereal'' powers. The \u201cfinest hour\u201d of the Axis powers \u201cended precisely the moment they threw themselves against the two largest cereal lebensraums\u201d (the United States and the USSR).<ref>Ostrovsky 2006: p 159.</ref> The outcome of the Cold War followed the Soviet grave and long-lasting cereal crisis, exacerbated by the cereal embargo imposed on the USSR in 1980.<ref>Ostrovsky 2006: p 172.</ref> And, called \u201cthe grain basket of the world,\u201d the most productive \u201ccereal lebensraum\u201d dominates the world ever since.<ref>Ostrovsky 2006: p 206.</ref>\n\nHaving analyzed the mechanism at work behind this pattern, Ostrovsky outlined that the cereal power determines the percentage of manpower available to non-agricultural sectors including the heavy industry vital for military power.

Most are [[annual plant]]s; consequently one planting yields one harvest. Wheat, rye, triticale, oats, barley, and spelt are the \"cool-season\" cereals.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} These are hardy plants that grow well in moderate weather and cease to grow in hot weather (approximately {{convert|30|\u00b0C|disp=sqbr}}, but this varies by species and variety). The \"warm-season\" cereals are tender and prefer hot weather. Barley and rye are the hardiest cereals, able to overwinter in the [[subarctic]] and [[Siberia]]. Many cool-season cereals are grown in the tropics. However, some are only grown in cooler highlands, where it ' \"may\" ' be possible to grow multiple crops per year.\n\nFor the past few decades, there has also been increasing interest in [[perennial]] grain plants. This interest developed due to advantages in erosion control, reduced need for fertiliser, and potential lowered costs to the farmer. Though research is still in early stages, [[The Land Institute]] in Salina, Kansas has been able to create a few cultivars that produce a fairly good crop yield.<ref>Kunzig, Robert (April 2011) [http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/04/big-idea/perennial-grains-text The Big Idea: Perennial Grains] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005202205/http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/04/big-idea/perennial-grains-text |date=5 October 2011 }}. National Geographic.</ref>\n\n===Planting===\n[[File:Dinr\u00eayes.jpg|thumb|Cereal [[grain]] seeds from left to right, top to bottom: [[wheat]], [[spelt]], [[barley]], [[oat]].]]\nThe warm-season cereals are grown in tropical lowlands year-round and in temperate climates during the frost-free season. Rice is commonly grown in flooded fields, though some strains are grown on dry land. Other warm climate cereals, such as [[sorghum]], are adapted to arid conditions.\n\nCool-season cereals are well-adapted to temperate climates. Most varieties of a particular species are either '''winter''' or '''spring''' types. Winter varieties are sown in the autumn, germinate and grow vegetatively, then become [[dormancy|dormant]] during winter. They resume growing in the springtime and mature in late spring or early summer. This cultivation system makes optimal use of water and frees the land for another crop early in the growing season.\n\nWinter varieties do not flower until springtime because they require [[vernalization]]: exposure to low temperatures for a genetically determined length of time. Where winters are too warm for vernalization or exceed the hardiness of the crop (which varies by species and variety), farmers grow spring varieties. Spring cereals are planted in early springtime and mature later that same summer, without vernalization. Spring cereals typically require more irrigation and yield less than winter cereals.\n\n===Harvesting===\n[[File:3-piantagione, Taccuino Sanitatis, Casanatense 4182.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Threshing; ''Tacuinum Sanitatis'', 14th century]]\nOnce the cereal plants have grown their seeds, they have completed their [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]]. The plants die, become brown, and dry. As soon as the parent plants and their seed kernels are reasonably dry, harvest can begin.\n\nIn developed countries, cereal crops are universally machine-harvested, typically using a [[combine harvester]], which cuts, [[threshing|threshes]], and [[winnowing|winnows]] the grain during a single pass across the field. In developing countries, a variety of harvesting methods are in use, depending on the cost of labor, from combines to hand tools such as the [[scythe]] or [[grain cradle]].\n\nIf a crop is harvested during humid weather, the grain may not dry adequately in the field to prevent spoilage during its storage. In this case, the grain is sent to a dehydrating facility, where artificial heat dries it.\n\nIn North America, farmers commonly deliver their newly harvested grain to a [[grain elevator]], a large storage facility that consolidates the crops of many farmers. The farmer may sell the grain at the time of delivery or maintain ownership of a share of grain in the pool for later sale. Storage facilities should be protected from small grain pests, rodents and birds.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:MaizeYield.png|thumb|right|Worldwide maize production]]\n[[File:RiceYield.png|thumb|right|Worldwide rice production]]\n[[File:WheatYield.png|thumb|right|A map of worldwide wheat production.]]\nThe following table shows the annual production of cereals in 1961,{{efn|1961 is the earliest year for which [[FAO]] statistics are available.}} 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013 ranked by 2013 production.<ref name=\"prodstat\">{{cite web | url=http://faostat.fao.org/site/567/DesktopDefault.aspx | title=ProdSTAT | work=FAOSTAT | accessdate=26 December 2006 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210214103/http://faostat.fao.org/site/567/DesktopDefault.aspx | archivedate=10 February 2012 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n{| valign=\"top\" | class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=2 | Grain\n! colspan=5 nowrap | Worldwide production <br /> (millions of metric tons)\n! rowspan=2 | Notes\n|-\n! 1961 !! 2010 !! 2011 !! 2012 !! 2013\n|-\n| [[Maize]] (corn)\n| align=\"center\" | 205\n| align=\"center\" | 851\n| align=\"center\" | 888\n| align=\"center\" | 872\n| align=\"center\" | 1016\n| A staple food of people in the Americas, Africa, and of [[livestock]] worldwide; often called corn in North America, Australia, and New Zealand.

Its flour and whole grain products can usually be found in natural foods stores.\n* [[Wild rice]], grown in small amounts in North America.\n\nSeveral other species of wheat have also been domesticated, some very early in the history of agriculture:\n* [[Spelt]], a close relative of common wheat.\n* [[Einkorn]], a wheat species with a single grain.\n* [[Emmer]], one of the first crops domesticated in the [[Fertile Crescent]].\n* [[Durum]], the only [[tetraploid]] species of wheat currently cultivated, used to make [[semolina]].\n* [[Kamut]], an ancient relative of durum with an unknown history.\n\nIn 2013 global cereal production reached a record 2,521 million tonnes. A slight dip to 2,498 million tonnes was forecasted for 2014 by the FAO in July 2014.\n\n== Nutritional facts ==\nSome grains are deficient in the [[essential amino acid]], [[lysine]]. That is why many vegetarian cultures, in order to get a balanced diet, combine their diet of grains with [[legume]]s. Many legumes, however, are deficient in the essential amino acid [[methionine]], which grains contain. Thus, a [[protein combining|combination]] of legumes with [[grain]]s forms a well-balanced diet for vegetarians. Common examples of such combinations are [[dal]] (lentils) with [[rice]] by [[South India]]ns and [[Bengali people|Bengalis]], dal with wheat in [[Pakistan]] and [[North India]], [[beans]] with corn tortillas, [[tofu]] with rice, and [[peanut butter]] with wheat bread (as sandwiches) in several other cultures, including the Americas.<ref name=\"vogel301\">{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/primemovernatura0000voge |url-access=registration |publisher=W.W.

[[Emmer|Emmer wheat]], [[einkorn wheat]], and [[barley]] were three of the so-called [[Neolithic founder crops]] in the development of agriculture. Around the same time, millets and rices were starting to become domesticated in East Asia. Sorghum and millets were also being domesticated in sub-Saharan West Africa.\n\n==Cereals and civilization==\nCereals were the foundation of human civilization. Cereal frontiers coincided with civilizational frontiers. The term [[Fertile Crescent]] explicitely implies the spatial dependence of civilization on cereals. [[The Great Wall]] of China and the [[Roman limes|Roman limes]] demarkated the same northern limit of the cereal cultivation. The [[Silk Road]] stretched along the cereal belt of Eurasia. Numerous Chinese imperial edicts stated: \u201cAgriculture is the foundation of this empire,\u201d<ref>Max Ostrovsky, ''The Hyperbola of the World Order'', Lanham: University Press of America, 2006, p 86.</ref> while the foundation of agriculture were the [[Five Grains]].  \n\nCereals determined how large and for how long an army could be mobilized. For this reason, [[Shang Yang]] called agriculture and war \u201cthe One.\u201d<ref>Ostrovsky 2006: p 62.</ref> [[Guan Zhong]], [[Chanakya]] (the author of ''[[Arthashastra]]'')<ref>Ostrovsky 2006: p 63-64.</ref> and [[Hannibal]]<ref>Ostrovsky 2006: p 85.</ref> expressed similar concepts. At the dawn of history, the Sumerians believed that if agriculture of a state declines, [[Inanna]], the goddess of war, leaves this state.<ref>Ostrovsky 2006: p 68.</ref> Several gods of antiquity combined the functions of what Shang Yang called \u201cthe One\u201d \u2013 agriculture and war: the Hittite [[Sun goddess of Arinna]], the Canaanite [[Lahmu]] and the Roman [[Janus]]. These were highly important gods in their time leaving their legacy until today. We still begin the year with the month of Janus (January). The Jews believe that Messiah will be born in the town of Lahmu ([[Bethlehem]]) and the Christians believe that he was already born there. Lahmu is the responsible why in Hebrew until today ''bread'' (''lehem'') and ''warfare'' (''lehima'') are of the same root.  In fact, most persistent and flourishing empires throughout history in both hemispheres were centered in regions fertile for cereals.\n\nHistorian Max Ostrovsky argues that this historic pattern never changed, not even in the [[Industrial Age]].<ref>Max Ostrovsky, ''The Hyperbola of the World Order'', Lanham: University Press of America, 2006, p 111-126.</ref> He stresses that all modern great powers have traditionally remained first and foremost great ''cereal'' powers. The \u201cfinest hour\u201d of the Axis powers \u201cended precisely the moment they threw themselves against the two largest cereal lebensraums\u201d (the United States and the USSR).<ref>Ostrovsky 2006: p 159.</ref> The outcome of the Cold War followed the Soviet grave and long-lasting cereal crisis, exacerbated by the cereal embargo imposed on the USSR in 1980.<ref>Ostrovsky 2006: p 172.</ref> And, called \u201cthe grain basket of the world,\u201d the most productive \u201ccereal lebensraum\u201d dominates the world ever since.<ref>Ostrovsky 2006: p 206.</ref>\n\nHaving analyzed the mechanism at work behind this pattern, Ostrovsky outlined that the cereal power determines the percentage of manpower available to non-agricultural sectors including the heavy industry vital for military power.

Most are [[annual plant]]s; consequently one planting yields one harvest. Wheat, rye, triticale, oats, barley, and spelt are the \"cool-season\" cereals.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} These are hardy plants that grow well in moderate weather and cease to grow in hot weather (approximately {{convert|30|\u00b0C|disp=sqbr}}, but this varies by species and variety). The \"warm-season\" cereals are tender and prefer hot weather. Barley and rye are the hardiest cereals, able to overwinter in the [[subarctic]] and [[Siberia]]. Many cool-season cereals are grown in the tropics. However, some are only grown in cooler highlands, where it ' \"may\" ' be possible to grow multiple crops per year.\n\nFor the past few decades, there has also been increasing interest in [[perennial]] grain plants. This interest developed due to advantages in erosion control, reduced need for fertiliser, and potential lowered costs to the farmer. Though research is still in early stages, [[The Land Institute]] in Salina, Kansas has been able to create a few cultivars that produce a fairly good crop yield.<ref>Kunzig, Robert (April 2011) [http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/04/big-idea/perennial-grains-text The Big Idea: Perennial Grains] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005202205/http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/04/big-idea/perennial-grains-text |date=5 October 2011 }}. National Geographic.</ref>\n\n===Planting===\n[[File:Dinr\u00eayes.jpg|thumb|Cereal [[grain]] seeds from left to right, top to bottom: [[wheat]], [[spelt]], [[barley]], [[oat]].]]\nThe warm-season cereals are grown in tropical lowlands year-round and in temperate climates during the frost-free season. Rice is commonly grown in flooded fields, though some strains are grown on dry land. Other warm climate cereals, such as [[sorghum]], are adapted to arid conditions.\n\nCool-season cereals are well-adapted to temperate climates. Most varieties of a particular species are either '''winter''' or '''spring''' types. Winter varieties are sown in the autumn, germinate and grow vegetatively, then become [[dormancy|dormant]] during winter. They resume growing in the springtime and mature in late spring or early summer. This cultivation system makes optimal use of water and frees the land for another crop early in the growing season.\n\nWinter varieties do not flower until springtime because they require [[vernalization]]: exposure to low temperatures for a genetically determined length of time. Where winters are too warm for vernalization or exceed the hardiness of the crop (which varies by species and variety), farmers grow spring varieties. Spring cereals are planted in early springtime and mature later that same summer, without vernalization. Spring cereals typically require more irrigation and yield less than winter cereals.\n\n===Harvesting===\n[[File:3-piantagione, Taccuino Sanitatis, Casanatense 4182.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Threshing; ''Tacuinum Sanitatis'', 14th century]]\nOnce the cereal plants have grown their seeds, they have completed their [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]]. The plants die, become brown, and dry. As soon as the parent plants and their seed kernels are reasonably dry, harvest can begin.\n\nIn developed countries, cereal crops are universally machine-harvested, typically using a [[combine harvester]], which cuts, [[threshing|threshes]], and [[winnowing|winnows]] the grain during a single pass across the field. In developing countries, a variety of harvesting methods are in use, depending on the cost of labor, from combines to hand tools such as the [[scythe]] or [[grain cradle]].\n\nIf a crop is harvested during humid weather, the grain may not dry adequately in the field to prevent spoilage during its storage. In this case, the grain is sent to a dehydrating facility, where artificial heat dries it.\n\nIn North America, farmers commonly deliver their newly harvested grain to a [[grain elevator]], a large storage facility that consolidates the crops of many farmers. The farmer may sell the grain at the time of delivery or maintain ownership of a share of grain in the pool for later sale. Storage facilities should be protected from small grain pests, rodents and birds.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:MaizeYield.png|thumb|right|Worldwide maize production]]\n[[File:RiceYield.png|thumb|right|Worldwide rice production]]\n[[File:WheatYield.png|thumb|right|A map of worldwide wheat production.]]\nThe following table shows the annual production of cereals in 1961,{{efn|1961 is the earliest year for which [[FAO]] statistics are available.}} 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013 ranked by 2013 production.<ref name=\"prodstat\">{{cite web | url=http://faostat.fao.org/site/567/DesktopDefault.aspx | title=ProdSTAT | work=FAOSTAT | accessdate=26 December 2006 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210214103/http://faostat.fao.org/site/567/DesktopDefault.aspx | archivedate=10 February 2012 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n{| valign=\"top\" | class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=2 | Grain\n! colspan=5 nowrap | Worldwide production <br /> (millions of metric tons)\n! rowspan=2 | Notes\n|-\n! 1961 !! 2010 !! 2011 !! 2012 !! 2013\n|-\n| [[Maize]] (corn)\n| align=\"center\" | 205\n| align=\"center\" | 851\n| align=\"center\" | 888\n| align=\"center\" | 872\n| align=\"center\" | 1016\n| A staple food of people in the Americas, Africa, and of [[livestock]] worldwide; often called corn in North America, Australia, and New Zealand.

Its flour and whole grain products can usually be found in natural foods stores.\n* [[Wild rice]], grown in small amounts in North America.\n\nSeveral other species of wheat have also been domesticated, some very early in the history of agriculture:\n* [[Spelt]], a close relative of common wheat.\n* [[Einkorn]], a wheat species with a single grain.\n* [[Emmer]], one of the first crops domesticated in the [[Fertile Crescent]].\n* [[Durum]], the only [[tetraploid]] species of wheat currently cultivated, used to make [[semolina]].\n* [[Kamut]], an ancient relative of durum with an unknown history.\n\nIn 2013 global cereal production reached a record 2,521 million tonnes. A slight dip to 2,498 million tonnes was forecasted for 2014 by the FAO in July 2014.\n\n== Nutritional facts ==\nSome grains are deficient in the [[essential amino acid]], [[lysine]]. That is why many vegetarian cultures, in order to get a balanced diet, combine their diet of grains with [[legume]]s. Many legumes, however, are deficient in the essential amino acid [[methionine]], which grains contain. Thus, a [[protein combining|combination]] of legumes with [[grain]]s forms a well-balanced diet for vegetarians. Common examples of such combinations are [[dal]] (lentils) with [[rice]] by [[South India]]ns and [[Bengali people|Bengalis]], dal with wheat in [[Pakistan]] and [[North India]], [[beans]] with corn tortillas, [[tofu]] with rice, and [[peanut butter]] with wheat bread (as sandwiches) in several other cultures, including the Americas.<ref name=\"vogel301\">{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/primemovernatura0000voge |url-access=registration |publisher=W.W.

However, there is some debate as to whether simple legislation would be sufficient to grant statehood to District of Columbia, which is the [[seat of government|seat of the United States federal government]].\n\nIf the District of Columbia were to become a state \u2013 based on 2018 figures \u2013 it would rank [[List of states and territories of the United States by population|49th by population]], [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|51st by area]], [[List of U.S. states by GDP per capita|1st by GDP per capita]], [[List of U.S. states and territories by income|1st by median household income]], and [[List of U.S. states and territories by GDP|34th by total GDP]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:US flag 51 stars.svg|thumb|The [[United States Army Institute of Heraldry|U.S. Army Institute of Heraldry]] has designed this 51-star version of the national flag for use in the event that a [[51st state]] is admitted into the Union.]]\n\n===District Clause of the Constitution===\nIn 1783, a crowd of disbanded Revolutionary War soldiers angry about not having been paid gathered to [[Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783|protest outside the building]] where the [[Continental Congress]] was meeting in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. The soldiers blocked the door and initially refused to allow the delegates to leave. Despite requests from the Congress, the Pennsylvania state government declined to call out its militia to deal with the unruly mob, and so Congress was forced to abruptly adjourn to New Jersey.\n\nThis led to the widespread belief that Congress needed control over the national capital. As [[James Madison]] wrote in The Federalist No. 43, \"Without it, not only the public authority might be insulted and its proceedings interrupted with impunity; but a dependence of the members of the general government on the State comprehending the seat of the government, for protection in the exercise of their duty, might bring on the national councils an imputation of awe or influence, equally dishonorable to the government and dissatisfactory to the other members of the Confederacy.\" This belief resulted in the creation of a national capital, separate from any state, by the Constitution's District Clause.<ref>{{cite book |title=District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2007: Hearing Notes |date=March 14, 2007 |publisher=DIANE publishing |isbn=978-1-4223-2085-3 |page=23 }}<!--|accessdate=November 17, 2015--></ref>\n\nThe \"District Clause\" in [[Bankruptcy Clause (United States Constitution)|Article I, Section 8, Clause 17]] of the [[United States Constitution]] states:{{quote|[The Congress shall have Power] To exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding ten miles square) as may, by cession of particular states, and the acceptance of Congress, become the seat of the government of the United States.}}\n\nHowever, Madison further wrote in Federalist 43 that the residents of the new federal district \"will have had their voice in the election of the government which is to exercise authority over them.\"  Madison did not elaborate as to how this would be but even with a then unidentified parcel suggested that the principles of self-government would not be absent in the capital of the Republic.\n\n===Early discussions of voting rights===\nIn 1788, the land on which the District is formed was ceded by [[Maryland]]. In 1790, Congress passed the [[Residence Act]] placing the District on the [[Potomac River]] between the Anacostia and Connogochegue with the exact location chosen by President Washington. His selection was announced on January 24, 1791, and the Residence Act was amended to include land that [[Virginia]] had ceded in 1790. That land was [[District of Columbia retrocession#Virginia retrocession|returned to Virginia]] in 1847. The [[United States Congress|Congress]] did not officially move to the new federal capital until the first Monday in December 1800. During that time the District was governed by a combination of a federally appointed Board of Commissioners, the state legislatures and locally elected governments.<ref name=Seat/>\n\nWithin a year of moving to the District, Congress passed the [[District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801]] and incorporated the new federal District under its sole authority as permitted by the District Clause. Since the District of Columbia was no longer part of any state, the District's residents lost voting representation in Congress and the Electoral College as well as a voice in Constitutional Amendments and the right to home rule, facts that did not go without protest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abanet.org/poladv/letters/electionlaw/060914testimony_dcvoting.pdf|title=Statement on the subject of The District of Columbia Fair and Equal Voting Rights Acts|accessdate=July 10, 2008|date=September 14, 2006|publisher=[[American Bar Association]]}}</ref> In January 1801, a meeting of District citizens was held which resulted in a statement to Congress noting that as a result of the impending Organic Act \"we shall be completely disfranchised in respect to the national government, while we retain no security for participating in the formation of even the most minute local regulations by which we are to be affected.

Citizens fearful that the seat of government be moved asked that DC be given a territorial government and an amendment to the Constitution for equal rights. But James Holland of North Carolina argued that creating a territorial government would leave citizens dissatisfied. He said, \"the next step will be a request to be admitted as a member of the Union, and, if you pursue the practice relative to territories, you must, so soon as their numbers will authorize it, admit them into the Union.\"<ref>Congressional Record, 1805: 979\u2013980.</ref>\n\n===Late 19th and early 20th century===\nThe first proposal for congressional representation to get serious consideration came in 1888, but it wouldn't be until 1921 that congressional hearings would be held on the subject. Those hearings resulted in the first bill, introduced by Sen. [[Wesley Livsey Jones]] (R-WA), to be reported out of committee that would have addressed District representation. The bill would have enabled - though not required \u2013 Congress to treat residents of DC as though they were citizens of a state.\n\n===Civil rights era and the 23rd Amendment, 1950s\u20131970s===\nCongressional members continued to propose amendments to address the District's lack of representation, with efforts picking up as part of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the late 1950s. This eventually resulted in successful passage of the [[Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-third Amendment]] in 1961, which granted the District votes in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] in proportion to their size as if they were a state, but no more than the least populous state.

The statehood legislation supported by the District government and some House Democrats gets around this by carving out an [[enclave]] within the proposed state, encompassing the [[White House]], [[United States Capitol|Capitol Building]], [[United States Supreme Court Building|Supreme Court Building]], and other major federal offices, to act as the new District of Columbia for constitutional purposes.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://statehood.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/statehood/page_content/attachments/HR-1291.pdf |title=H.

However, there is some debate as to whether simple legislation would be sufficient to grant statehood to District of Columbia, which is the [[seat of government|seat of the United States federal government]].\n\nIf the District of Columbia were to become a state \u2013 based on 2018 figures \u2013 it would rank [[List of states and territories of the United States by population|49th by population]], [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|51st by area]], [[List of U.S. states by GDP per capita|1st by GDP per capita]], [[List of U.S. states and territories by income|1st by median household income]], and [[List of U.S. states and territories by GDP|34th by total GDP]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:US flag 51 stars.svg|thumb|The [[United States Army Institute of Heraldry|U.S. Army Institute of Heraldry]] has designed this 51-star version of the national flag for use in the event that a [[51st state]] is admitted into the Union.]]\n\n===District Clause of the Constitution===\nIn 1783, a crowd of disbanded Revolutionary War soldiers angry about not having been paid gathered to [[Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783|protest outside the building]] where the [[Continental Congress]] was meeting in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. The soldiers blocked the door and initially refused to allow the delegates to leave. Despite requests from the Congress, the Pennsylvania state government declined to call out its militia to deal with the unruly mob, and so Congress was forced to abruptly adjourn to New Jersey.\n\nThis led to the widespread belief that Congress needed control over the national capital. As [[James Madison]] wrote in The Federalist No. 43, \"Without it, not only the public authority might be insulted and its proceedings interrupted with impunity; but a dependence of the members of the general government on the State comprehending the seat of the government, for protection in the exercise of their duty, might bring on the national councils an imputation of awe or influence, equally dishonorable to the government and dissatisfactory to the other members of the Confederacy.\" This belief resulted in the creation of a national capital, separate from any state, by the Constitution's District Clause.<ref>{{cite book |title=District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2007: Hearing Notes |date=March 14, 2007 |publisher=DIANE publishing |isbn=978-1-4223-2085-3 |page=23 }}<!--|accessdate=November 17, 2015--></ref>\n\nThe \"District Clause\" in [[Bankruptcy Clause (United States Constitution)|Article I, Section 8, Clause 17]] of the [[United States Constitution]] states:{{quote|[The Congress shall have Power] To exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding ten miles square) as may, by cession of particular states, and the acceptance of Congress, become the seat of the government of the United States.}}\n\nHowever, Madison further wrote in Federalist 43 that the residents of the new federal district \"will have had their voice in the election of the government which is to exercise authority over them.\"  Madison did not elaborate as to how this would be but even with a then unidentified parcel suggested that the principles of self-government would not be absent in the capital of the Republic.\n\n===Early discussions of voting rights===\nIn 1788, the land on which the District is formed was ceded by [[Maryland]]. In 1790, Congress passed the [[Residence Act]] placing the District on the [[Potomac River]] between the Anacostia and Connogochegue with the exact location chosen by President Washington. His selection was announced on January 24, 1791, and the Residence Act was amended to include land that [[Virginia]] had ceded in 1790. That land was [[District of Columbia retrocession#Virginia retrocession|returned to Virginia]] in 1847. The [[United States Congress|Congress]] did not officially move to the new federal capital until the first Monday in December 1800. During that time the District was governed by a combination of a federally appointed Board of Commissioners, the state legislatures and locally elected governments.<ref name=Seat/>\n\nWithin a year of moving to the District, Congress passed the [[District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801]] and incorporated the new federal District under its sole authority as permitted by the District Clause. Since the District of Columbia was no longer part of any state, the District's residents lost voting representation in Congress and the Electoral College as well as a voice in Constitutional Amendments and the right to home rule, facts that did not go without protest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abanet.org/poladv/letters/electionlaw/060914testimony_dcvoting.pdf|title=Statement on the subject of The District of Columbia Fair and Equal Voting Rights Acts|accessdate=July 10, 2008|date=September 14, 2006|publisher=[[American Bar Association]]}}</ref> In January 1801, a meeting of District citizens was held which resulted in a statement to Congress noting that as a result of the impending Organic Act \"we shall be completely disfranchised in respect to the national government, while we retain no security for participating in the formation of even the most minute local regulations by which we are to be affected.

Citizens fearful that the seat of government be moved asked that DC be given a territorial government and an amendment to the Constitution for equal rights. But James Holland of North Carolina argued that creating a territorial government would leave citizens dissatisfied. He said, \"the next step will be a request to be admitted as a member of the Union, and, if you pursue the practice relative to territories, you must, so soon as their numbers will authorize it, admit them into the Union.\"<ref>Congressional Record, 1805: 979\u2013980.</ref>\n\n===Late 19th and early 20th century===\nThe first proposal for congressional representation to get serious consideration came in 1888, but it wouldn't be until 1921 that congressional hearings would be held on the subject. Those hearings resulted in the first bill, introduced by Sen. [[Wesley Livsey Jones]] (R-WA), to be reported out of committee that would have addressed District representation. The bill would have enabled - though not required \u2013 Congress to treat residents of DC as though they were citizens of a state.\n\n===Civil rights era and the 23rd Amendment, 1950s\u20131970s===\nCongressional members continued to propose amendments to address the District's lack of representation, with efforts picking up as part of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the late 1950s. This eventually resulted in successful passage of the [[Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-third Amendment]] in 1961, which granted the District votes in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] in proportion to their size as if they were a state, but no more than the least populous state. This right has been exercised by D.C. citizens since the [[1964 United States presidential election|presidential election of 1964]].\n\nWith District citizens still denied full suffrage, members continued to propose bills to address congressional representation. Such bills made it out of committee in 1967 and 1972, for a House floor for a vote in 1976 and in 1978 resulted in the formal proposal of the [[District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment]]. But that amendment expired in 1985, 22 ratifications short of the needed 38.\n\n===Statehood movement, 1980s and beyond===\n[[File:DC statehood now flag at Inauguration 2013.jpg|thumb|DC Statehood Now! flag at [[Second inauguration of Barack Obama|Inauguration 2013]]]]\n\nBefore the failure of the Voting Rights Amendment, but when passage seemed unlikely, District voters finally began to pursue statehood.

The U.S. Constitution requires that any new states formed from an existing state receive permission from the legislature. Since Maryland granted land to form the national capital and not a new state, some lawmakers have concluded that Maryland must also consent to the new state.<ref name=\"Health1987\">{{cite book|last=Health|first=United States.

This is inconsistent with being on equal footing with all other states. The statehood legislation supported by the District government and some House Democrats gets around this by carving out an [[enclave]] within the proposed state, encompassing the [[White House]], [[United States Capitol|Capitol Building]], [[United States Supreme Court Building|Supreme Court Building]], and other major federal offices, to act as the new District of Columbia for constitutional purposes.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://statehood.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/statehood/page_content/attachments/HR-1291.pdf |title=H.

Most proposals generally involve either treating the District of Columbia more like a state or allowing Maryland to take back the land it donated to form the District.\n\nIf both Congress and the Maryland General Assembly agreed, jurisdiction over the District of Columbia could be returned to Maryland or given to Virginia if the state legislature of Virginia agreed, possibly excluding a small tract of land immediately surrounding the [[United States Capitol]], the [[White House]] and the Supreme Court building.

Medieval music was an era of [[Classical music|Western music]], including [[liturgical music]] (also known as sacred) used for the church, and [[secular music]], non-religious music.

Bach]] and [[Classical music period]] composers from the 1700s such as [[W.A. Mozart]] and [[Romantic music]] era composers from the 1800s such as [[Wagner]]. The most obvious of these is the development of a comprehensive [[music notation]]al system which enabled composers to write out their song melodies and instrumental pieces on parchment or paper. Prior to the development of musical notation, songs and pieces had to be learned \"by ear\", from one person who knew a song to another person. This greatly limited how many people could be taught new music and how wide music could spread to other regions or countries. The development of music notation made it easier to disseminate (spread) songs and musical pieces to a larger number of people and to a wider geographic area. However the theoretical advances, particularly in regard to [[rhythm]]\u2014the timing of notes\u2014and [[polyphony]]\u2014using multiple, interweaving [[melody|melodies]] at the same time\u2014are equally important to the development of Western music. It aswell as made music a very happy place for ejaculation power.\n\n==Overview==\n\n===Instruments===\n[[File:Vielle.jpg|right|thumb|A musician plays the [[vielle]] in a fourteenth-century [[Medieval]] [[manuscript]]]]\n\nMany instruments used to perform medieval music still exist in the 21st century, but in different and typically more [[music technology (mechanical)|technologically developed]] forms.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} The [[flute]] was made of wood in the medieval era rather than [[silver]] or other [[metal]], and could be made as a side-blown or end-blown instrument. While modern orchestral flutes are usually made of metal and have complex key mechanisms and airtight pads, medieval flutes had holes that the performer had to cover with the fingers (as with the recorder). The [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]] was made of wood during the Medieval era, and despite the fact that in the 2000s, it may be made of synthetic materials, it has more or less retained its past form. The [[gemshorn]] is similar to the recorder as it has finger holes on its front, though it is actually a member of the [[ocarina]] family. One of the flute's predecessors, the [[pan flute]], was popular in medieval times, and is possibly of [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] origin. This instrument's pipes were made of wood, and were graduated in length to produce different pitches.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nMedieval music used many plucked [[string instrument]]s like the [[lute]], a fretted instrument with a pear-shaped hollow body which is the predecessor to the modern [[guitar]]. Other plucked stringed instruments included the [[Mandore (instrument)|mandore]], [[gittern]], [[citole]] and [[psaltery]]. The [[hammered dulcimer|dulcimers]], similar in structure to the [[psaltery]] and [[zither]], were originally plucked, but musicians began to strike the dulcimer with hammers in the 14th century after the arrival of new metal technology that made metal strings possible.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nThe bowed [[Byzantine lyra|lyra]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] was the first recorded European bowed string instrument. Like the modern violin, a performer produced sound by moving a bow with tensioned hair over tensioned strings. The [[Persian people|Persian]] geographer [[Ibn Khordadbeh|Ibn Khurradadhbih]] of the 9th century (d. 911) cited the [[Byzantine lyra]], in his lexicographical discussion of instruments as a bowed instrument equivalent to the Arab [[rab\u0101b]] and typical instrument of the Byzantines along with the ''urghun'' ([[Organ (music)|organ]]),<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.medievalhistories.com/early-medieval-organs/|title=Early Medieval Organs \u2013 Medieval Histories|date=2014-07-30|work=Medieval Histories|access-date=2017-09-19|language=en-US}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=September 2017}}<!--Source does establish a connection between Byzantium and organs in the Carolingian Empire, but does not mention the name \"urghun\", nor are the lyra or rebab named or described.--> ''shilyani'' (probably a type of [[harp]] or [[lyre]]) and the ''salandj'' (probably a [[bagpipe]]).<ref name=Kartomi124>{{harvnb|Kartomi|1990|p=124.}}</ref> The [[hurdy-gurdy]] was (and still is) a mechanical [[violin]] using a rosined wooden wheel attached to a crank to \"bow\" its strings. Instruments without sound boxes like the [[jew's harp]] were also popular. Early versions of the [[Organ (music)|pipe organ]], [[fiddle]] (or [[vielle]]), and a precursor to the modern [[trombone]] (called the [[sackbut]]) were used.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n===Genres===\n{{further|Gregorian chant|Ars nova|Organum|Motet|Madrigal (music)|Canon (music)|Ballata}}\nMedieval music was composed and, for some vocal and instrumental music, [[musical improvisation|improvised]] for many different [[music genre]]s (styles of music). Medieval music created for [[sacred music|sacred]] (church use) and [[secular music|secular]] (non-religious use) was typically written by composers,{{sfn|Hoppin|1978|p=256}} except for some sacred vocal and secular instrumental music which was [[Music improvisation|improvised]] (made up on-the-spot). During the [[Early Middle Ages|earlier medieval period]], the [[liturgy|liturgical]] genre, predominantly [[Gregorian chant]] done by monks, was [[Monophony|monophonic]] (\"monophonic\" means a single melodic line, without a harmony part or instrumental accompaniment).{{sfn|Hoppin|1978|p=57}} [[Polyphony|Polyphonic]] genres, in which multiple independent melodic lines are performed simultaneously, began to develop during the [[High Middle Ages|high medieval era]], becoming prevalent by the later 13th and early 14th century. The development of polyphonic forms, with different voices interweaving, is often associated with the late Medieval [[Ars nova]] style which flourished in the 1300s. The Ars Nova, which means \"new art\" was an innovative style of writing music that served as a key transition from the medieval music style to the more expressive styles of the post-1400s Renaissance music era.\n\nThe earliest innovations upon monophonic plainchant were [[heterophony|heterophonic]]. \"Heterophony\" is the performance of the same melody by two different performers at the same time, in which each performer slightly alters the ornaments she or he is using. Another simple form of heterophony is for singers to sing the same shape of melody, but with one person singing the melody and a second person singing the melody at a higher or lower pitch. [[Organum]], for example, expanded upon plainchant melody using an accompanying line, sung at a fixed [[interval (music)|interval]] (often a [[perfect fifth]] or [[perfect fourth]] away from the main melody), with a resulting alternation between a simple form of polyphony and monophony.<ref>Vanderbilt University Online Reference Book for Medieval Studies{{Full citation needed|date=January 2018}}<!--Online sources require URLs.--></ref> The principles of organum date back to an anonymous 9th century tract, the ''[[Musica enchiriadis]]'', which established the tradition of duplicating a preexisting plainchant in parallel motion at the interval of an octave, a fifth or a fourth.{{sfn|Hoppin|1978|p=189}}\n\nOf greater sophistication was the [[motet]], which developed from the [[Clausula (music)|clausula]] genre of medieval [[plainchant]]. The motet would become the most popular form of medieval polyphony.{{sfn|Yudkin|1989|pp=382, 391}} While early motets were liturgical or sacred (designed for use in a church service), by the end of the thirteenth century the genre had expanded to include secular topics, such as [[courtly love]]. Courtly love was the respectful veneration of a lady from afar by an amorous, noble man. Many popular motets had lyrics about a man's love and adoration of beautiful, noble and much-admired woman.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nThe Medieval motet developed during the [[Renaissance music]] era (after 1400). During the Renaissance, the Italian secular genre of the [[Madrigal (music)|Madrigal]] became popular. Similar to the polyphonic character of the motet, madrigals featured greater fluidity and motion in the leading melody line. The madrigal form also gave rise to polyphonic [[Canon (music)|canons]] (songs in which multiple singers sing the same melody, but starting at different times), especially in Italy where they were called ''caccie.'' These were three-part secular pieces, which featured the two higher voices in canon, with an underlying instrumental long-note accompaniment.{{sfn|Yudkin|1989|p=529}}\n\nFinally, purely instrumental music also developed during this period, both in the context of a growing theatrical tradition and for [[Court (royal)|court]] performances for the aristocracy. Dance music, often improvised around familiar tropes, was the largest purely instrumental genre.{{sfn|Yudkin|1989|p=434}} The secular [[Ballata]], which became very popular in [[Trecento]] Italy, had its origins, for instance, in medieval instrumental dance music.{{sfn|Yudkin|1989|p=523}}\n\n===Theory and notation===\nDuring the Medieval period the foundation was laid for the notational and theoretical practices that would shape Western music into the norms that developed during the [[Common practice period|common practice era]]. The most obvious of these is the development of a comprehensive [[music notation]]al system; however the theoretical advances, particularly in regard to rhythm and polyphony, are equally important to the development of Western music.\n\n====Notation====\n[[File:Gregorian chant.gif|frame|A sample of [[Kyrie|K\u00fdrie El\u00e9ison]] XI (Orbis Factor) from the ''Liber Usualis''. The modern \"neumes\" on the staff above the text indicate the pitches of the [[melody]]. [//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Kyrie_XI_%28Orbis_Factor%29_sample.ogg Listen] to it interpreted.]]\nThe earliest Medieval music did not have any kind of notational system. The tunes were primarily monophonic (a single [[melody]] without [[accompaniment]]) and transmitted by oral tradition.{{sfn|Hoppin|1978|p=57}}  As Rome tried to centralize the various liturgies and establish the Roman rite as the primary church tradition the need to transmit these chant melodies across vast distances effectively was equally glaring.{{sfn|Seay|1965|p=41}} So long as music could only be taught to people \"by ear,\" it limited the ability of the church to get different regions to sing the same melodies, since each new person would have to spend time with a person who already knew a song and learn it \"by ear.\" The first step to fix this problem came with the introduction of various signs written above the chant texts to indicate direction of pitch movement, called ''[[neumes]]''.{{sfn|Hoppin|1978|p=57}}\n\nThe origin of ''neumes'' is unclear and subject to some debate; however, most scholars agree that their closest ancestors are the classic Greek and Roman grammatical signs that indicated important points of declamation by recording the rise and fall of the voice.{{sfn|Parrish|1957|p=4}} The two basic signs of the classical grammarians were the ''acutus'', /, indicating a raising of the voice, and the ''gravis'', \\, indicating a lowering of the voice. A singer reading a chant text with neume markings would be able to get a general sense of whether the melody line went up in pitch, stayed the same, or went down in pitch. For a singer who already knew a song, seeing the written neume markings above the text could help to jog his or her memory about how the melody went. However, a singer reading a chant text with neume markings would not be able to [[sight read]] a song which he or she had never heard sung before.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nThese neumes eventually evolved into the basic symbols for ''neumatic'' notation, the ''virga'' (or \"rod\") which indicates a higher note and still looked like the ''acutus'' from which it came; and the ''punctum'' (or \"dot\") which indicates a lower note and, as the name suggests, reduced the ''gravis'' symbol to a point.{{sfn|Parrish|1957|p=4}} Thus the ''acutus'' and the ''gravis'' could be combined to represent graphical vocal inflections on the syllable.{{sfn|Parrish|1957|p=4}} This kind of notation seems to have developed no earlier than the eighth century, but by the ninth it was firmly established as the primary method of musical notation.{{sfn|Hoppin|1978|p=58}} The basic notation of the ''virga'' and the ''punctum'' remained the symbols for individual notes, but other ''neumes'' soon developed which showed several notes joined together. These new ''neumes''\u2014called ligatures\u2014are essentially combinations of the two original signs.{{sfn|Parrish|1957|p=5}}\n\nThe first music notation was the use of dots over the lyrics to a chant, with some dots being higher or lower, giving the reader a general sense of the direction of the melody. However, this form of notation only served as a memory aid for a singer who already knew the melody.{{sfn|Seay|1965|p=40}} This basic ''neumatic'' notation could only specify the number of notes and whether they moved up or down. There was no way to indicate exact pitch, any rhythm, or even the starting note. These limitations are further indication that the ''neumes'' were developed as tools to support the practice of oral tradition, rather than to supplant it. However, even though it started as a mere memory aid, the worth of having more specific notation soon became evident.{{sfn|Hoppin|1978|p=58}}\n\nThe next development in musical notation was \"heighted ''neumes''\", in which ''neumes'' were carefully placed at different heights in relation to each other. This allowed the ''neumes'' to give a rough indication of the size of a given interval as well as the direction. This quickly led to one or two lines, each representing a particular note, being placed on the music with all of the ''neumes'' relating to the earlier ones. At first, these lines had no particular meaning and instead had a letter placed at the beginning indicating which note was represented. However, the lines indicating middle C and the F a fifth below slowly became most common. Having been at first merely scratched on the parchment, the lines now were drawn in two different colored inks: usually red for F, and yellow or green for C. This was the beginning of the musical staff.{{sfn|Hoppin|1978|pp=59\u201360}} The completion of the four-line staff is usually credited to [[Guido of Arezzo|Guido d\u2019 Arezzo]] (c. 1000\u20131050), one of the most important musical theorists of the Middle Ages. While older sources attribute the development of the staff to Guido, some modern scholars suggest that he acted more as a codifier of a system that was already being developed. Either way, this new notation allowed a singer to learn pieces completely unknown to him in a much shorter amount of time.{{sfn|Seay|1965|p=41}}{{sfn|Hoppin|1978|p=60}} However, even though chant notation had progressed in many ways, one fundamental problem remained: rhythm. The ''neumatic'' notational system, even in its fully developed state, did not clearly define any kind of rhythm for the singing of notes.{{sfn|Hoppin|1978|p=89}}\n\n====Music theory====\n{{expand section|date=December 2014}}\nThe [[music theory]] of the Medieval period saw several advances over previous practice both in regard to tonal material, texture, and rhythm.\n\n=====Rhythm=====\n[[File:Perotin - Alleluia nativitas.jpg|thumb|P\u00e9rotin, \"Alleluia nativitas\", in the third rhythmic mode.]]\nConcerning [[rhythm]], this period had several dramatic changes in both its conception and notation. During the early Medieval period there was no method to notate rhythm, and thus the rhythmical practice of this early music is subject to heated debate among scholars.{{sfn|Hoppin|1978|p=89}} The first kind of written rhythmic system developed during the 13th century and was based on a series of modes. This rhythmic plan was codified by the music theorist [[Johannes de Garlandia (music theorist)|Johannes de Garlandia]], author of the ''[[De Mensurabili Musica]]'' (c.1250), the treatise which defined and most completely elucidated these [[rhythmic mode]]s.<ref>Christensen (2002), p. 628.</ref> In his treatise Johannes de Garlandia describes six ''species'' of mode, or six different ways in which longs and breves can be arranged. Each mode establishes a rhythmic pattern in beats (or ''tempora'') within a common unit of three ''tempora'' (a ''perfectio'') that is repeated again and again. Furthermore, notation without text is based on chains of [[Ligature (music)|''ligature''s]] (the characteristic notations by which groups of notes are bound to one another).\n\nThe rhythmic mode can generally be determined by the patterns of ligatures used.<ref>Christensen (2002), pp. 629\u201330.</ref> Once a rhythmic mode had been assigned to a melodic line, there was generally little deviation from that mode, although rhythmic adjustments could be indicated by changes in the expected pattern of ligatures, even to the extent of changing to another rhythmic mode.{{sfn|Ultan|1977|p=10}} The next step forward concerning rhythm came from the [[Germany|German]] theorist [[Franco of Cologne]]. In his treatise ''[[Ars cantus mensurabilis]]'' (\"The Art of Mensurable Music\"), written around 1280, he describes a system of notation in which differently shaped notes have entirely different rhythmic values. This is a striking change from the earlier system of de Garlandia. Whereas before the length of the individual note could only be gathered from the mode itself, this new inverted relationship made the mode dependent upon\u2014and determined by\u2014the individual notes or ''figurae'' that have incontrovertible durational values,<ref>Christensen (2002), p. 632.</ref> an innovation which had a massive impact on the subsequent history of European music. Most of the surviving notated music of the 13th century uses the rhythmic modes as defined by Garlandia. The step in the evolution of rhythm came after the turn of the 13th century with the development of the ''Ars Nova'' style.\n\nThe theorist who is most well recognized in regard to this new style is [[Philippe de Vitry]], famous for writing the ''[[Ars Nova]]'' (\"New Art\") treatise around 1320. This treatise on music gave its name to the style of this entire era.{{sfn|Yudkin|1989|p=458}} In some ways the modern system of rhythmic notation began with Vitry, who completely broke free from the older idea of the rhythmic modes. The notational predecessors of modern time meters also originate in the ''Ars Nova''. This new style was clearly built upon the work of Franco of Cologne. In Franco's system, the relationship between a [[Double whole note|breve]] and a [[Whole note|semibreves]] (that is, half breves) was equivalent to that between a breve and a long: and, since for him ''modus'' was always perfect (grouped in threes), the ''tempus'' or beat was also inherently perfect and therefore contained three semibreves. Sometimes the context of the mode would require a group of only two semibreves, however, these two semibreves would always be one of normal length and one of double length, thereby taking the same space of time, and thus preserving the perfect subdivision of the ''tempus''.{{sfn|Caldwell|1978|p=160}} This ternary division held for all note values. In contrast, the ''Ars Nova'' period introduced two important changes: the first was an even smaller subdivision of notes (semibreves, could now be divided into ''[[Minim (music)|minim]]''), and the second was the development of \"mensuration.\"\n\nMensurations could be combined in various manners to produce metrical groupings. These groupings of mensurations are the precursors of simple and compound meter.<ref name=\"Christensen635\">Christensen (2002), p. 635.</ref> By the time of ''Ars Nova'', the perfect division of the ''tempus'' was not the only option as duple divisions became more accepted. For Vitry the breve could be divided, for an entire composition, or section of one, into groups of two or three smaller semibreves. This way, the ''tempus'' (the term that came to denote the division of the breve) could be either \"perfect\" (''tempus perfectum''), with ternary subdivision, or \"imperfect\" (''tempus imperfectum''), with binary subdivision.{{sfn|Hoppin|1978|pp=354\u201355}} In a similar fashion, the semibreve's division (termed ''prolation'') could be divided into three ''minima'' (''[[prolation|prolatio]] perfectus'' or major prolation) or two ''minima'' (''prolatio imperfectus'' or minor prolation) and, at the higher level, the [[Longa (music)|longs]] division (called ''modus'') could be three or two breves (''[[Rhythmic mode|modus]] perfectus'' or perfect mode, or ''modus imperfectus'' or imperfect mode respectively).{{sfn|Ultan|1977|pp=62\u201363.}}{{sfn|Hoppin|1978|p=355}} Vitry took this a step further by indicating the proper division of a given piece at the beginning through the use of a \"mensuration sign\", equivalent to our modern \"time signature\".{{sfn|Seay|1965|p=131}}\n\n''Tempus perfectum'' was indicated by a circle, while ''tempus imperfectum'' was denoted by a half-circle{{sfn|Seay|1965|p=131}} (the current symbol {{music|common-time}}, used as an alternative for the {{music|time|4|4}} time signature, is actually a holdover of this symbol, not a letter ''C'' as an abbreviation for \"common time\", as popularly believed). While many of these innovations are ascribed to Vitry, and somewhat present in the ''Ars Nova'' treatise, it was a contemporary\u2014and personal acquaintance\u2014of de Vitry, named [[Jean de Muris|Johannes de Muris]] ([[Jehan des Mars]]) who offered the most comprehensive and systematic treatment of the new mensural innovations of the ''Ars Nova''<ref name=\"Christensen635\"/> (for a brief explanation of the mensural notation in general, see the article [[Renaissance music#Theory and notation|Renaissance music]]). Many scholars, citing a lack of positive attributory evidence, now consider \"Vitry's\" treatise to be anonymous, but this does not diminish its importance for the history of rhythmic notation. However, this makes the first definitely identifiable scholar to accept and explain the mensural system to be de Muris, who can be said to have done for it what Garlandia did for the rhythmic modes.\n\nFor the duration of the medieval period, most music would be composed primarily in perfect tempus, with special effects created by sections of imperfect tempus; there is a great current controversy among musicologists as to whether such sections were performed with a breve of equal length or whether it changed, and if so, at what proportion. This ''Ars Nova'' style remained the primary rhythmical system until the highly syncopated works of the ''[[Ars subtilior]]'' at the end of the 14th century, characterized by extremes of notational and rhythmic complexity.{{sfn|Hoppin|1978|p=472}} This sub-genera pushed the rhythmic freedom provided by ''Ars Nova'' to its limits, with some compositions having different voices written in different mensurations simultaneously. The rhythmic complexity that was realized in this music is comparable to that in the 20th century.{{sfn|McKinnon|1990|p=237}}\n\n=====Polyphony=====\n[[File:P\u00e9rotin - Viderunt omnes.jpg|thumb|right|170px|[[P\u00e9rotin]]'s ''Viderunt omnes'', ca. 13th century.]]\nOf equal importance to the overall history of western music theory were the textural changes that came with the advent of polyphony. This practice shaped western music into the harmonically dominated music that we know today.{{sfn|Hoppin|1978|p=187}} The first accounts of this textural development were found in two anonymous yet widely circulated treatises on music, the ''[[Musica enchiriadis|Musica]]'' and the ''[[Scolica enchiriadis]]''. These texts are dated to sometime within the last half of the ninth century.<ref name=\"Christensen 2002, p. 480\">Christensen (2002), p. 480.</ref> The treatises describe a technique that seemed already to be well established in practice.<ref name=\"Christensen 2002, p. 480\"/> This early polyphony is based on three simple and three compound intervals. The first group comprises fourths, fifths, and octaves; while the second group has octave-plus-fourths, octave-plus-fifths, and double octaves.<ref name=\"Christensen 2002, p. 480\"/> This new practice is given the name ''[[organum]]'' by the author of the treatises.<ref name=\"Christensen 2002, p. 480\"/> ''Organum'' can further be classified depending on the time period in which it was written. The early ''organum'' as described in the ''enchiriadis'' can be termed \"strict ''organum''\" {{sfn|Ultan|1977|p=52}} Strict ''organum'' can, in turn, be subdivided into two types: ''diapente'' (organum at the interval of a fifth) and ''diatesseron'' (organum at the interval of a fourth).{{sfn|Ultan|1977|p=52}} However, both of these kinds of strict ''organum'' had problems with the musical rules of the time. If either of them paralleled an original chant for too long (depending on the mode) a [[tritone]] would result.{{sfn|Ultan|1977|p=53}}\n\nThis problem was somewhat overcome with the use of a second type of ''organum''. This second style of ''organum'' was called \"free ''organum''\". Its distinguishing factor is that the parts did not have to move only in parallel motion, but could also move in oblique, or contrary motion. This made it much easier to avoid the dreaded tritone.{{sfn|Ultan|1977|p=55}} The final style of ''organum'' that developed was known as \"[[melismatic]] ''organum''\", which was a rather dramatic departure from the rest of the polyphonic music up to this point. This new style was not note against note, but was rather one sustained line accompanied by a florid melismatic line.{{sfn|Ultan|1977|p=58}} This final kind of ''organum'' was also incorporated by the most famous polyphonic composer of this time\u2014[[L\u00e9onin]]. He united this style with measured [[discant]] passages, which used the rhythmic modes to create the pinnacle of ''organum'' composition.{{sfn|Ultan|1977|p=58}} This final stage of ''organum'' is sometimes referred to as [[Notre Dame school]] of polyphony, since that was where L\u00e9onin (and his student [[P\u00e9rotin]]) were stationed. Furthermore, this kind of polyphony influenced all subsequent styles, with the later polyphonic genera of motets starting as a trope of existing Notre Dame ''organums''.\n\nAnother important element of Medieval music theory was the system by which pitches were arranged and understood. During the Middle Ages, this systematic arrangement of a series of whole steps and half steps, what we now call a [[Musical scale|scale]], was known as a [[Gregorian mode|mode]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} The modal system worked like the scales of today, insomuch that it provided the rules and material for melodic writing.{{sfn|Seay|1965|p=32}} The eight church modes are: ''[[Dorian mode|Dorian]]'', ''[[Hypodorian]]'', ''[[Phrygian mode|Phrygian]]'', ''[[Hypophrygian mode|Hypophrygian]]'', ''[[Lydian mode|Lydian]]'', ''[[Hypolydian mode|Hypolydian]]'', ''[[Mixolydian]]'', and ''[[Hypomixolydian mode|Hypomixolydian]]''.{{sfn|Seay|1965|p=33}} Much of the information concerning these modes, as well as the practical application of them, was codified in the 11th century by the theorist [[Johannes Afflighemensis]]. In his work he describes three defining elements to each mode: the final (or ''finalis)'', the reciting tone (''tenor'' or ''confinalis''), and the range (or ''ambitus''). The ''finalis'' is the tone that serves as the focal point for the mode and, as the name suggests, is almost always used as the final tone. The reciting tone is the tone that serves as the primary focal point in the melody (particularly internally). It is generally also the tone most often repeated in the piece, and finally the range delimits the upper and lower tones for a given mode.{{sfn|Ultan|1977|p=25}} The eight modes can be further divided into four categories based on their final (''finalis'').\n\nMedieval theorists called these pairs ''maneriae'' and labeled them according to the Greek ordinal numbers. Those modes that have d, e, f, and g as their final are put into the groups ''protus'', ''deuterus'', ''tritus'', and ''tetrardus'' respectively.{{sfn|Hoppin|1978|p=64}} These can then be divided further based on whether the mode is \"authentic\" or \"plagal.\" These distinctions deal with the range of the mode in relation to the final. The authentic modes have a range that is about an octave (one tone above or below is allowed) and start on the final, whereas the plagal modes, while still covering about an octave, start a perfect fourth below the authentic.<ref>Christensen (2002), p. 311.</ref> Another interesting aspect of the modal system is the universal allowance for altering B{{music|natural}} to B{{music|flat}} no matter what the mode.{{sfn|Hoppin|1978|p=66}}{{Verify source|date=May 2017}}<!--Does Hoppin really say this? If so, then Mixolydian could have either a major or a minor third, and Ionian could have either a major or minor seventh.--> The inclusion of this tone has several uses, but one that seems particularly common is in order to avoid melodic difficulties caused, once again, by the tritone.{{sfn|Seay|1965|p=34}}\n\nThese ecclesiastical modes, although they have Greek names, have little relationship to the modes as set out by Greek theorists. Rather, most of the terminology seems to be a misappropriation on the part of the medieval theorists{{sfn|Seay|1965|p=33}} Although the church modes have no relation to the ancient Greek modes, the overabundance of Greek terminology does point to an interesting possible origin in the liturgical melodies of the [[Byzantine music|Byzantine]] tradition. This system is called ''[[octoechos]]'' and is also divided into eight categories, called ''echoi''.<ref>Christensen (2002), p. 310.</ref> \n \nFor specific medieval music theorists, see also: [[Isidore of Seville]], [[Aurelian of R\u00e9\u00f4me]], [[Odo of Cluny]], [[Guido of Arezzo]], [[Hermannus Contractus]], [[Johannes Cotto]] (Johannes Afflighemensis), [[Johannes de Muris]], [[Franco of Cologne]], [[Johannes de Garlandia (music theorist)|Johannes de Garlandia]] (Johannes Gallicus), [[Anonymous IV]], [[Marchetto da Padova]] (Marchettus of Padua), [[Jacob of Li\u00e8ge|Jacques of Li\u00e8ge]], [[Johannes de Grocheo]], [[Petrus de Cruce]] (Pierre de la Croix), and [[Philippe de Vitry]].\n\n==Early medieval music (before 1150)==\n\n===Early chant traditions===\n{{main|Plainsong}}\n{{See also|Gregorian chant}}\n[[Gregorian chant|Chant]] (or [[plainsong]]) is a [[texture (music)|monophonic]] sacred (single, unaccompanied melody) form which represents the earliest known music of the Christian church. Chant developed separately in several European centres. Although the most important were [[Rome]], [[Hispania]], [[Gaul]], [[Milan]], and [[Ireland]], there were others as well. These styles were all developed to support the regional liturgies used when celebrating the Mass there. Each area developed its own chant and rules for celebration. In Spain and [[Portugal]], [[Mozarabic chant]] was used and shows the influence of [[Music of North Africa|North African music]]. The Mozarabic liturgy even survived through [[Muslim]] rule, though this was an isolated strand and this music was later suppressed in an attempt to enforce conformity on the entire liturgy. In Milan, [[Ambrosian chant]], named after [[St. Ambrose]], was the standard, while [[Beneventan chant]] developed around [[Benevento]], another Italian liturgical center. [[Gallican chant]] was used in Gaul, and [[Celtic chant]] in Ireland and Great Britain.\n\nAround AD 1011, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] wanted to standardize the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] and chant across its empire. At this time, Rome was the religious centre of western Europe, and Paris was the political centre. The standardization effort consisted mainly of combining these two ([[Roman Rite|Roman]] and [[Gallican rite|Gallican]]) regional liturgies. [[Pope Gregory I]] (540\u2013604) and [[Charlemagne]] (742\u2013814) sent trained singers throughout the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (800|962\u20131806) to teach this new form of chant.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Music in the Middle Ages|last=Lorde|first=Suzanne|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}</ref> This body of chant became known as [[Gregorian chant|Gregorian Chant]], named after [[Pope Gregory I]]. By the 12th and 13th centuries, Gregorian chant had superseded all the other Western chant traditions, with the exception of the Ambrosian chant in Milan and the Mozarabic chant in a few specially designated Spanish chapels. [[Hildegard von Bingen]] (1098\u20131179) was the earliest known female composer. She wrote many monophonic works for the Catholic Church, almost all of them for female voices.\n\n===Early polyphony: organum===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}\n{{main|Organum}}\nAround the end of the 9th century, singers in monasteries such as [[Abbey of St. Gall|St. Gall]] in [[Switzerland]] began experimenting with adding another part to the chant, generally a [[human voice|voice]] in [[contrary motion|parallel motion]], singing mostly in perfect [[perfect fourth|fourths]] or [[perfect fifth|fifths]] above the original tune (see [[interval (music)|interval]]). This development is called [[organum]] and represents the beginnings of [[counterpoint]] and, ultimately, [[harmony]]. Over the next several centuries, organum developed in several ways.\n\nThe most significant of these developments was the creation of \"florid organum\" around 1100, sometimes known as the [[school of St. Martial]] (named after a monastery in south-central France, which contains the best-preserved manuscript of this repertory). In \"florid organum\" the original tune would be sung in long notes while an accompanying voice would sing many notes to each one of the original, often in a highly elaborate fashion, all the while emphasizing the perfect [[consonance and dissonance|consonances]] (fourths, fifths and octaves), as in the earlier organa. Later developments of organum occurred in England, where the interval of the [[Interval (music)|third]] was particularly favoured, and where organa were likely improvised against an existing chant melody, and at [[Notre Dame school|Notre Dame]] in Paris, which was to be the centre of musical creative activity throughout the thirteenth century.\n\nMuch of the music from the early medieval period is [[Anonymous work|anonymous]]. Some of the names may have been poets and lyric writers, and the tunes for which they wrote words may have been composed by others. Attribution of monophonic music of the medieval period is not always reliable. Surviving manuscripts from this period include the [[Musica Enchiriadis]], [[Codex Calixtinus]] of [[Santiago de Compostela]], the [[Magnus Liber]], and the [[Winchester Troper]]. For information about specific composers or poets writing during the early medieval period, see [[Pope Gregory I]], [[Godric of Finchale|St. Godric]], [[Hildegard of Bingen]], [[Hucbald]], [[Notker of St Gall|Notker Balbulus]], [[Odo of Arezzo]], [[Odo of Cluny]], and [[Tuotilo|Tutilo]].\n\n===Liturgical drama===\n{{Main|Liturgical drama}}\nAnother musical tradition of Europe originating during the early Middle Ages was the [[liturgical drama]].\n\nLiturgical drama developed possibly in the 10th century from the tropes\u2014poetic embellishments of the liturgical texts. One of the tropes, the so-called Quem Quaeritis, belonging to the liturgy of Easter morning, developed into a short play around the year 950.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} The oldest surviving written source is the Winchester Troper. Around the year 1000 it was sung all around Europe.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}<!--Who claims the Winchester Troper was sung all over Europe?-->\n\nShortly,{{Clarify|date=September 2018}} a similar Christmas play was developed, musically and textually following the Easter one, and other plays followed.\n\nThere is a controversy among musicologists as to the instrumental accompaniment of such plays, given that the stage directions, very elaborate and precise in other respects, do not request any participation of instruments.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} These dramas were performed by monks, nuns and priests.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} In contrast to secular plays, which were spoken, the liturgical drama was always sung.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Many have been preserved sufficiently to allow modern reconstruction and performance (for example the ''[[Play of Daniel]]'', which has been recently recorded at least ten times).\n\n===Goliards===\n{{main|Goliards}}\nThe [[Goliard]]s were [[itinerant poet]]-musicians of Europe from the tenth to the middle of the thirteenth century. Most were scholars or [[ecclesiastic]]s, and they wrote and sang in Latin. Although many of the poems have survived, very little of the music has. They were possibly influential\u2014even decisively so\u2014on the [[troubadour]]-[[trouv\u00e8re]] tradition which was to follow. Most of their poetry is secular and, while some of the songs celebrate religious ideals, others are frankly profane, dealing with drunkenness, debauchery and lechery. One of the most important extant sources of Goliards chansons is the [[Carmina Burana]].<ref>Anderson, Gordon A., and Thomas B.

Sometimes the music of this period is called the Parisian school, or Parisian organum, and represents the beginning of what is conventionally known as ''[[Ars antiqua]]''. This was the period in which [[rhythm]]ic notation first appeared in western music, mainly a context-based method of rhythmic notation known as the [[rhythmic mode]]s.\n\nThis was also the period in which concepts of [[musical form|formal]] structure developed which were attentive to proportion, [[musical texture|texture]], and architectural effect. Composers of the period alternated florid and discant organum (more note-against-note, as opposed to the succession of many-note melismas against long-held notes found in the florid type), and created several new musical forms: [[Clausula (music)|clausula]]e, which were [[melisma]]tic sections of organa extracted and fitted with new words and further musical elaboration; [[conductus]], which were songs for one or more voices to be sung rhythmically, most likely in a procession of some sort; and [[trope (music)|tropes]], which were additions of new words and sometimes new music to sections of older chant. All of these genres save one were based upon chant; that is, one of the voices, (usually three, though sometimes four) nearly always the lowest (the tenor at this point) sang a chant melody, though with freely composed note-lengths, over which the other voices sang organum. The exception to this method was the conductus, a two-voice composition that was freely composed in its entirety.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nThe [[motet]], one of the most important musical forms of the high Middle Ages and Renaissance, developed initially during the Notre Dame period out of the clausula, especially the form using multiple voices as elaborated by [[P\u00e9rotin]], who paved the way for this particularly by replacing many of his predecessor (as canon of the cathedral) [[L\u00e9onin]]'s lengthy florid clausulae with substitutes in a discant style. Gradually, there came to be entire books of these substitutes, available to be fitted in and out of the various chants. Since, in fact, there were more than can possibly have been used in context, it is probable that the clausulae came to be performed independently, either in other parts of the mass, or in private devotions. The clausula, thus practised, became the motet when troped with non-liturgical words, and this further developed into a form of great elaboration, sophistication and subtlety in the fourteenth century, the period of ''Ars nova''. Surviving manuscripts from this era include the [[Montpellier Codex]], [[Bamberg Codex]], and [[Las Huelgas Codex]].\n\nComposers of this time include [[L\u00e9onin]], [[P\u00e9rotin]], [[W. de Wycombe]], [[Adam de St. Victor]], and [[Petrus de Cruce]] (Pierre de la Croix). Petrus is credited with the innovation of writing more than three semibreves to fit the length of a breve. Coming before the innovation of imperfect tempus, this practice inaugurated the era of what are now called \"Petronian\" motets. These late 13th-century works are in three to four parts and have multiple texts sung simultaneously. Originally, the tenor line (from the Latin ''[[tenere]]'', \"to hold\") held a preexisting liturgical chant line in the original Latin, while the text of the one, two, or even three voices above, called the ''voces organales'', provided commentary on the liturgical subject either in Latin or in the vernacular French. The rhythmic values of the ''voces organales'' decreased as the parts multiplied, with the ''duplum'' (the part above the tenor) having smaller rhythmic values than the tenor, the ''triplum'' (the line above the ''duplum'') having smaller rhythmic values than the ''duplum'', and so on. As time went by, the texts of the ''voces organales'' became increasingly secular in nature and had less and less overt connection to the liturgical text in the tenor line.<ref>Hindley (1971), pp.66\u201369.</ref>\n\nThe Petronian motet is a highly complex genre, given its mixture of several semibreve breves with rhythmic modes and sometimes (with increasing frequency) substitution of secular songs for chant in the tenor. Indeed, ever-increasing rhythmic complexity would be a fundamental characteristic of the 14th century, though music in France, Italy, and England would take quite different paths during that time.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n===Cantigas de Santa Maria===\n{{main|Cantigas de Santa Maria}}\nThe '''''Cantigas de Santa Maria''''' (\"Canticles of St. Mary\") are 420 poems with musical notation, written in [[Galician-Portuguese]] during the reign of [[Alfonso X of Castile|Alfonso X ''El Sabio'']] (1221\u20131284) and often attributed to him. It is one of the largest collections of monophonic (solo) songs from the [[Middle Ages]] and is characterized by the mention of the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] in every song, while every tenth song is a hymn. The manuscripts have survived in four codices: two at [[El Escorial]], one at [[Madrid]]'s [[Biblioteca Nacional de Espa\u00f1a|National Library]], and one in [[Florence, Italy]]. Some have colored [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] showing pairs of musicians playing a wide variety of [[musical instrument|instruments]].\n\n===Troubadours and trouv\u00e8res===\n{{main|Troubadour}}\n[[File:Troubadours berlin.jpg|thumb|200px|Trobadours, 14th century]]\nThe music of the [[troubadour]]s and [[trouv\u00e8re]]s was a vernacular tradition of monophonic secular song, probably accompanied by instruments, sung by professional, occasionally itinerant, musicians who were as skilled as poets as they were singers and instrumentalists. The language of the troubadours was [[Occitan]] (also known as the [[langue d'oc]], or Proven\u00e7al); the language of the trouv\u00e8res was Old French (also known as [[langue d'oil]]). The period of the troubadours corresponded to the flowering of cultural life in [[Provence]] which lasted through the twelfth century and into the first decade of the thirteenth. Typical subjects of troubadour song were [[war]], [[chivalry]] and [[courtly love]]\u2014the love of an idealized woman from afar. The period of the troubadours wound down after the [[Albigensian Crusade]], the fierce campaign by [[Pope Innocent III]] to eliminate the [[Cathar]] heresy (and northern barons' desire to appropriate the wealth of the south). Surviving troubadours went either to [[Portugal]], Spain, northern Italy or northern France (where the trouv\u00e8re tradition lived on), where their skills and techniques contributed to the later developments of secular musical culture in those places.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe trouv\u00e8res and troubadours shared similar musical styes, but the trouv\u00e8res were generally noblemen.<ref name=\":0\" /> The music of the trouv\u00e8res was similar to that of the troubadours, but was able to survive into the thirteenth century unaffected by the Albigensian Crusade. Most of the more than two thousand surviving trouv\u00e8re songs include music, and show a sophistication as great as that of the poetry it accompanies.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nThe [[Minnesang|Minnesinger]] tradition was the [[Germany|Germanic]] counterpart to the activity of the troubadours and trouv\u00e8res to the west. Unfortunately, few sources survive from the time; the sources of Minnesang are mostly from two or three centuries after the peak of the movement, leading to some controversy over the accuracy of these sources.{{sfn|Gibbs and Johnson|1997|p=225}} Among the Minnesingers with surviving music are [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]], [[Walther von der Vogelweide]], and [[Niedhart von Reuenthal]].\n\n===Trovadorismo===\n{{main|Galician-Portuguese lyric}}\n\nIn the Middle Ages, Galician-Portuguese was the language used in nearly all of Iberia for lyric poetry.{{sfn|Chandler and Schwartz|1991|p=197}} From this language derive both modern Galician and Portuguese. The Galician-Portuguese school, which was influenced to some extent (mainly in certain formal aspects) by the Occitan troubadours, is first documented at the end of the twelfth century and lasted until the middle of the fourteenth.\n\nThe earliest extant composition in this school is usually agreed to be Ora faz ost' o senhor de Navarra by the Portuguese Jo\u00e3o Soares de Paiva, usually dated just before or after 1200. The troubadours of the movement, not to be confused with the Occitan troubadours (who frequented courts in nearby Le\u00f3n and Castile), wrote almost entirely cantigas. Beginning probably around the middle of the thirteenth century, these songs, known also as cantares or trovas, began to be compiled in collections known as cancioneiros (songbooks). Three such anthologies are known: the Cancioneiro da Ajuda, the Cancioneiro Colocci-Brancuti (or Cancioneiro da Biblioteca Nacional de Lisboa), and the Cancioneiro da Vaticana. In addition to these there is the priceless collection of over 400 Galician-Portuguese cantigas in the Cantigas de Santa Maria, which tradition attributes to Alfonso X.\n\nThe Galician-Portuguese cantigas can be divided into three basic genres: male-voiced love poetry, called cantigas de amor (or cantigas d'amor) female-voiced love poetry, called cantigas de amigo (cantigas d'amigo); and poetry of insult and mockery called cantigas d'escarnho e de mal dizer. All three are lyric genres in the technical sense that they were strophic songs with either musical accompaniment or introduction on a stringed instrument. But all three genres also have dramatic elements, leading early scholars to characterize them as lyric-dramatic.\n\nThe origins of the cantigas d'amor are usually traced to Proven\u00e7al and Old French lyric poetry, but formally and rhetorically they are quite different. The cantigas d'amigo are probably rooted in a native song tradition ({{harvnb|Lang|1894|loc={{Page needed|date=August 2016}}}}; {{harvnb|Micha\u00eblis|1904|loc={{Page needed|date=August 2016}}}}), though this view has been contested. The cantigas d'escarnho e maldizer may also (according to Lang) have deep local roots. The latter two genres (totalling around 900 texts) make the Galician-Portuguese lyric unique in the entire panorama of medieval Romance poetry.\n\n;Troubadours with surviving melodies\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n\n* [[Aimeric de Belenoi]]\n* [[Aimeric de Peguilhan]]\n* [[Aires Nunes]]\n* [[Albertet de Sestaro]]\n* [[Arnaut Daniel]]\n* [[Arnaut de Maruoill]]\n* [[Beatritz de Dia]]\n* [[Berenguier de Palazol]]\n* [[Bernart de Ventadorn]]\n* [[Bertran de Born]]\n* [[Blacasset]]\n* [[Cadenet (troubadour)|Cadenet]]\n{{col-break}}\n\n* [[Daude de Pradas]]\n* [[Denis of Portugal]]\n* [[Folquet de Marselha]]\n* [[Gaucelm Faidit]]\n* [[Gui d'Ussel]]\n* [[Guilhem Ademar]]\n* [[Guilhem Augier Novella]]\n* [[Guilhem Magret]]\n* [[Guilhem de Saint Leidier]]\n* [[Guiraut de Bornelh]]\n* [[Guiraut d'Espanha]]\n{{col-break}}\n\n* [[Guiraut Riquier]]\n* [[Jaufre Rudel]]\n* [[Jo\u00e3o Soares de Paiva]]\n* [[Jo\u00e3o Zorro]]\n* [[Jordan Bonel]]\n* [[Marcabru]]\n* [[Mart\u00edn Codax]]\n* [[Monge de Montaudon]]\n* [[Peire d'Alvernhe]]\n* [[Peire Cardenal]]\n* [[Peire Raimon de Tolosa]]\n* [[Peire Vidal]]\n* [[Peirol]]\n* [[Perdigon]]\n{{col-break}}\n\n* [[Pistoleta]]\n* [[Pons d'Ortaffa]]\n* [[Pons de Capduoill]]\n* [[Raimbaut d'Aurenga]]\n* [[Raimbaut de Vaqueiras]]\n* [[Raimon Jordan]]\n* [[Raimon de Miraval]]\n* [[Rigaut de Berbezilh]]\n* [[Uc Brunet]]\n* [[Uc de Saint Circ]]\n* [[William IX of Aquitaine]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n;Composers of the high and late medieval era\n{{Timeline Classical Composers Medieval}}\n\n==Late medieval music (1300\u20131400)==\n\n===France: ''Ars nova''===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}\n{{main|Ars nova}}\n[[File:Charivari.jpg|thumb|250px|In this illustration from the satirical collection of music and poetry ''Roman de Fauvel'', the horse Fauvel is about to join Vainglory in the bridal bed and the people form a [[charivari]] in protest. ]]\nThe beginning of the ''[[Ars nova]]'' is one of the few clear chronological divisions in medieval music, since it corresponds to the publication of the ''[[Roman de Fauvel]]'', a huge compilation of poetry and music, in 1310 and 1314. The ''Roman de Fauvel'' is a satire on abuses in the medieval church, and is filled with medieval motets, [[Lai (poetic form)|lai]]s, [[Rondeau (music)|rondeaux]] and other new secular forms. While most of the music is anonymous, it contains several pieces by [[Philippe de Vitry]], one of the first composers of the [[isorhythm]]ic motet, a development which distinguishes the fourteenth century. The isorhythmic motet was perfected by [[Guillaume de Machaut]], the finest composer of the time.\n\nDuring the ''Ars nova'' era, secular music acquired a polyphonic sophistication formerly found only in sacred music, a development not surprising considering the secular character of the early Renaissance (while this music is typically considered \"medieval\", the social forces that produced it were responsible for the beginning of the literary and artistic Renaissance in Italy\u2014the distinction between Middle Ages and Renaissance is a blurry one, especially considering arts as different as music and painting). The term \"''Ars nova''\" (new art, or new technique) was coined by Philippe de Vitry in his treatise of that name (probably written in 1322), in order to distinguish the practice from the music of the immediately preceding age.\n\nThe dominant secular genre of the Ars Nova was the ''[[chanson]]'', as it would continue to be in France for another two centuries. These chansons were composed in musical forms corresponding to the poetry they set, which were in the so-called ''[[formes fixes]]'' of ''rondeau'', ''ballade'', and ''virelai''. These forms significantly affected the development of musical structure in ways that are felt even today; for example, the ''ouvert-clos'' rhyme-scheme shared by all three demanded a musical realization which contributed directly to the modern notion of antecedent and consequent phrases. It was in this period, too, in which began the long tradition of setting the mass ordinary. This tradition started around mid-century with isolated or paired settings of Kyries, Glorias, etc., but [[Guillaume de Machaut|Machaut]] composed what is thought to be the first complete mass conceived as one composition. The sound world of Ars Nova music is very much one of linear primacy and rhythmic complexity. \"Resting\" intervals are the fifth and octave, with thirds and sixths considered dissonances. Leaps of more than a sixth in individual voices are not uncommon, leading to speculation of instrumental participation at least in secular performance. Surviving French manuscripts include the [[Ivrea Codex]] and the [[Apt Codex]].\n\nFor information about specific French composers writing in late medieval era, see [[Jehan de Lescurel]], [[Philippe de Vitry]], [[Guillaume de Machaut]], [[Borlet]], [[Solage]], and [[Francois Andrieu|Fran\u00e7ois Andrieu]].\n\n===Italy: ''Trecento''===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}\n{{main|Music of the Trecento}}\nMost of the music of ''Ars nova'' was French in origin; however, the term is often loosely applied to all of the music of the fourteenth century, especially to include the secular music in Italy. There this period was often referred to as ''[[Trecento]]''. Italian music has always been known for its lyrical or melodic character, and this goes back to the 14th century in many respects. Italian secular music of this time (what little surviving liturgical music there is, is similar to the French except for somewhat different notation) featured what has been called the ''cantalina'' style, with a florid top voice supported by two (or even one; a fair amount of Italian Trecento music is for only two voices) that are more regular and slower moving. This type of texture remained a feature of Italian music in the popular 15th and 16th century secular genres as well, and was an important influence on the eventual development of the trio texture that revolutionized music in the 17th.\n\nThere were three main forms for secular works in the Trecento. One was the [[Trecento-Madrigal|madrigal]], not the same as that of 150\u2013250 years later, but with a verse/refrain-like form. Three-line stanzas, each with different words, alternated with a two-line ''[[ritornello]]'', with the same text at each appearance. Perhaps we can see the seeds of the subsequent late-Renaissance and Baroque ritornello in this device; it too returns again and again, recognizable each time, in contrast with its surrounding disparate sections. Another form, the ''caccia'' (\"chase,\") was written for two voices in a canon at the unison. Sometimes, this form also featured a ritornello, which was occasionally also in a canonic style. Usually, the name of this genre provided a double meaning, since the texts of caccia were primarily about hunts and related outdoor activities, or at least action-filled scenes. The third main form was the ''ballata'', which was roughly equivalent to the French ''virelai''.\n\nSurviving Italian manuscripts include the [[Squarcialupi Codex]] and the [[Rossi Codex]]. For information about specific Italian composers writing in the late medieval era, see [[Francesco Landini]], [[Gherardello da Firenze]], [[Andrea da Firenze]], [[Lorenzo da Firenze]], [[Giovanni da Firenze]] (aka Giovanni da Cascia), [[Bartolino da Padova]], [[Jacopo da Bologna]], [[Donato da Cascia]], [[Lorenzo Masini]], [[Niccol\u00f2 da Perugia]], and [[Maestro Piero]].\n\n===Germany: ''Geisslerlieder''===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}\n{{main|Geisslerlieder}}\nThe [[Geisslerlieder]] were the songs of wandering bands of [[flagellant]]s, who sought to appease the wrath of an angry God by penitential music accompanied by mortification of their bodies. There were two separate periods of activity of Geisslerlied: one around the middle of the thirteenth century, from which, unfortunately, no music survives (although numerous lyrics do); and another from 1349, for which both words and music survive intact due to the attention of a single priest who wrote about the movement and recorded its music. This second period corresponds to the spread of the [[Black Death]] in Europe, and documents one of the most terrible events in European history. Both periods of Geisslerlied activity were mainly in Germany.\n\n===Mannerism and ''Ars subtilior''===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}\n{{main|Ars subtilior}}\n[[File:CordierColor.jpg|thumb|right|The chanson ''Belle, bonne, sage'' by [[Baude Cordier]], an ''Ars subtilior'' piece included in the [[Chantilly Codex]]]]\nAs often seen at the end of any musical era, the end of the medieval era is marked by a highly manneristic style known as ''[[Ars subtilior]]''. In some ways, this was an attempt to meld the French and Italian styles. This music was highly stylized, with a rhythmic complexity that was not matched until the 20th century. In fact, not only was the rhythmic complexity of this repertoire largely unmatched for five and a half centuries, with extreme syncopations, mensural trickery, and even examples of ''augenmusik'' (such as a chanson by [[Baude Cordier]] written out in manuscript in the shape of a heart), but also its melodic material was quite complex as well, particularly in its interaction with the rhythmic structures. Already discussed under Ars Nova has been the practice of isorhythm, which continued to develop through late-century and in fact did not achieve its highest degree of sophistication until early in the 15th century. Instead of using isorhythmic techniques in one or two voices, or trading them among voices, some works came to feature a pervading isorhythmic texture which rivals the integral serialism of the 20th century in its systematic ordering of rhythmic and tonal elements. The term \"mannerism\" was applied by later scholars, as it often is, in response to an impression of sophistication being practised for its own sake, a malady which some authors have felt infected the ''Ars subtilior''.\n\nOne of the most important extant sources of Ars Subtilior chansons is the [[Chantilly Codex]]. For information about specific composers writing music in ''[[Ars subtilior]]'' style, see [[Anthonello de Caserta]], [[Philippus de Caserta]] (aka Philipoctus de Caserta), [[Johannes Ciconia]], [[Matteo da Perugia]], [[Lorenzo da Firenze]], [[Grimace (composer)|Grimace]], [[Jacob Senleches]], and [[Baude Cordier]].\n\n===Transitioning to the Renaissance===\n[[File:Busnois mass.jpg|thumb|left|200px| Manuscript of the Mass ''Missa O Crux Lignum'' by [[Antoine Busnois]] (ca. 1450).]]\nDemarcating the end of the medieval era and the beginning of the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance era]], with regard to the composition of music, is difficult. While the music of the fourteenth century is fairly obviously medieval in conception, the music of the early fifteenth century is often conceived as belonging to a transitional period, not only retaining some of the ideals of the end of the Middle Ages (such as a type of polyphonic writing in which the parts differ widely from each other in character, as each has its specific textural function), but also showing some of the characteristic traits of the Renaissance (such as the increasingly international style developing through the diffusion of Franco-Flemish musicians throughout Europe, and in terms of texture an increasing equality of parts). Music historians do not agree on when the Renaissance era began, but most historians agree that England was still a medieval society in the early fifteenth century (see [[Middle Ages#Periodization issues|periodization issues]] of the Middle Ages). While there is no consensus, 1400 is a useful marker, because it was around that time that the Renaissance came into full swing in [[Italy]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nThe increasing reliance on the interval of the third as a consonance is one of the most pronounced features of transition into the Renaissance. Polyphony, in use since the 12th century, became increasingly elaborate with highly independent voices throughout the 14th century. With [[John Dunstaple]] and other English composers, partly through the local technique of [[fauxbourdon|faburden]] (an improvisatory process in which a chant melody and a written part predominantly in parallel sixths above it are ornamented by one sung in perfect fourths below the latter, and which later took hold on the continent as \"fauxbordon\"), the interval of the third emerges as an important musical development; because of this ''[[Contenance Angloise]]'' (\"English countenance\"), English composers' music is often regarded as the first to sound less truly bizarre to 2000s-era audiences who are not trained in music history.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nEnglish stylistic tendencies in this regard had come to fruition and began to influence continental composers as early as the 1420s, as can be seen in works of the young [[Guillaume Dufay|Dufay]], among others. While the [[Hundred Years' War]] continued, English nobles, armies, their chapels and retinues, and therefore some of their composers, travelled in France and performed their music there; it must also of course be remembered that the English controlled portions of northern France at this time. English manuscripts include the [[Worcester Fragments]], the Old St. Andrews Music Book, the [[Old Hall Manuscript]], and Egerton Manuscript. For information about specific composers who are considered transitional between the medieval and the Renaissance, see [[Zacara da Teramo]], [[Paolo da Firenze]], [[Giovanni Mazzuoli]], [[Antonio da Cividale]], [[Antonius Romanus]], [[Bartolomeo da Bologna]], [[Roy Henry]], [[Arnold de Lantins]], [[Leonel Power]], and [[John Dunstaple]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nAn early composer from the [[Franco-Flemish School]] of the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] was [[Johannes Ockeghem]] (1410/1425 \u20131497). He was the most famous member of the Franco-Flemish School in the last half of the 15th century, and is often considered{{Weasel inline|date=May 2017}} the most influential composer between [[Guillaume Dufay|Dufay]] and [[Josquin des Prez]]. Ockeghem probably studied with [[Gilles Binchois]], and at least was closely associated with him at the Burgundian court. [[Antoine Busnois]] wrote a motet in honor of Ockeghem. Ockeghem is a direct link from the Burgundian style to the next generation of Netherlanders, such as [[Jacob Obrecht|Obrecht]] and Josquin. A strong influence on [[Josquin des Prez]] and the subsequent generation of Netherlanders, Ockeghem was famous throughout Europe [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]] for his expressive music, although he was equally renowned for his technical prowess.<ref name=\"Brown & Stein, p61-71\">{{harvnb|Brown and Stein|pp=61\u201371}}</ref>\n\n==Study and vocational training==\nThe [[Schola Cantorum Basiliensis]], university for old music in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]], provides a full-time practical study course for the music of the Middle Ages.<ref>[https://www.fhnw.ch/en/degree-programmes/music/schola-cantorum-basiliensis Schola Cantorum Basiliensis degree programme]</ref>\n\nA two-year vocational training for musicians is offered at the academy [http://www.burg-fuersteneck.de Burg F\u00fcrsteneck] in [[Germany]].\n\n[[Kees Boeke (musician)|Kees Boeke]] coordinates a new Master of Music- Musik des Mittelalters und des Renaissance for both singers and instrumentalists in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100107033243/http://www.mh-trossingen.de/english/studies/early-music/medieval-and-renaissance-music.html Staatliche Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik Trossingen], also in Germany.\n\n==Influence in contemporary music==\nThe musical styles of [[L\u00e9onin]] and [[P\u00e9rotin]] influenced 20th century [[Minimal music|minimalist]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnlutheradams.com/interview/endsoftheearth.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809090637/http://www.johnlutheradams.com/interview/endsoftheearth.html |archivedate=9 August 2011 }}</ref> composers such as [[Steve Reich]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://music.indiana.edu/html/som/theory/activities/colloquium.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120712215823/http://music.indiana.edu/html/som/theory/activities/colloquium.shtml |archivedate=12 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://public.wsu.edu/~delahoyd/20th/minimalism.html|title=Minimalism|work=wsu.edu}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=May 2017}}<!--Source compares one of Reich's works to Perotin, but does not claim there was any influence.-->\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Cantus coronatus]]\n* [[History of music]]\n* [[List of early music ensembles]]\n* [[List of Medieval composers]]\n* [[Medieval dance]]\n* [[Neo-Medieval music]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{wikicite|ref={{harvid|Brown and Stein}}|reference=Brown, and Stein. {{Full citation needed|date=May 2017}}}}\n* {{wikicite|ref={{harvid|Caldwell|1978}}|reference=Caldwell, John (1978), ''Medieval Music''.

Medieval music was an era of [[Classical music|Western music]], including [[liturgical music]] (also known as sacred) used for the church, and [[secular music]], non-religious music. Medieval music includes solely vocal music, such as [[Gregorian chant]] and [[Choir|choral music]] (music for a group of singers), solely [[instrumental music]], and music that uses both voices and instruments (typically with the instruments [[accompaniment|accompanying]] the voices). Gregorian chant was sung by monks during [[Catholic Mass]]. The Mass is a reenactment of Christ's [[Last Supper]], intended to provide a spiritual connection between man and God. Part of this connection was established through music.<ref>Kidder, D. S. and Oppenheim, N. D. (2010) ''The Intellectual Devotional''. p. 26, Borders  Group Inc., Ann Arbor, {{ISBN|978-1-60961-205-4}}</ref>\nThis era begins with the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] in the fifth century and ends sometime in the early fifteenth century. [[Dates of classical music eras|Establishing the end of the medieval era]] and the beginning of the [[Renaissance music]] era is difficult, since the trends started at different times in different regions. The date range in this article is the one usually adopted by [[musicologist]]s.\n\nDuring the Medieval period the foundation was laid for the [[music notation]] and [[music theory]] practices that would shape Western music into the norms that developed during the [[Common practice period|common-practice era]], a period of shared music writing practices which encompassed the [[Baroque music]] composers from 1600\u20131750, such as [[J.S. Bach]] and [[Classical music period]] composers from the 1700s such as [[W.A. Mozart]] and [[Romantic music]] era composers from the 1800s such as [[Wagner]]. The most obvious of these is the development of a comprehensive [[music notation]]al system which enabled composers to write out their song melodies and instrumental pieces on parchment or paper. Prior to the development of musical notation, songs and pieces had to be learned \"by ear\", from one person who knew a song to another person. This greatly limited how many people could be taught new music and how wide music could spread to other regions or countries. The development of music notation made it easier to disseminate (spread) songs and musical pieces to a larger number of people and to a wider geographic area. However the theoretical advances, particularly in regard to [[rhythm]]\u2014the timing of notes\u2014and [[polyphony]]\u2014using multiple, interweaving [[melody|melodies]] at the same time\u2014are equally important to the development of Western music.\n\n==Overview==\n\n===Instruments===\n[[File:Vielle.jpg|right|thumb|A musician plays the [[vielle]] in a fourteenth-century [[Medieval]] [[manuscript]]]]\n\nMany instruments used to perform medieval music still exist in the 21st century, but in different and typically more [[music technology (mechanical)|technologically developed]] forms.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} The [[flute]] was made of wood in the medieval era rather than [[silver]] or other [[metal]], and could be made as a side-blown or end-blown instrument. While modern orchestral flutes are usually made of metal and have complex key mechanisms and airtight pads, medieval flutes had holes that the performer had to cover with the fingers (as with the recorder). The [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]] was made of wood during the Medieval era, and despite the fact that in the 2000s, it may be made of synthetic materials, it has more or less retained its past form. The [[gemshorn]] is similar to the recorder as it has finger holes on its front, though it is actually a member of the [[ocarina]] family. One of the flute's predecessors, the [[pan flute]], was popular in medieval times, and is possibly of [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] origin. This instrument's pipes were made of wood, and were graduated in length to produce different pitches.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nMedieval music used many plucked [[string instrument]]s like the [[lute]], a fretted instrument with a pear-shaped hollow body which is the predecessor to the modern [[guitar]]. Other plucked stringed instruments included the [[Mandore (instrument)|mandore]], [[gittern]], [[citole]] and [[psaltery]]. The [[hammered dulcimer|dulcimers]], similar in structure to the [[psaltery]] and [[zither]], were originally plucked, but musicians began to strike the dulcimer with hammers in the 14th century after the arrival of new metal technology that made metal strings possible.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nThe bowed [[Byzantine lyra|lyra]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] was the first recorded European bowed string instrument. Like the modern violin, a performer produced sound by moving a bow with tensioned hair over tensioned strings. The [[Persian people|Persian]] geographer [[Ibn Khordadbeh|Ibn Khurradadhbih]] of the 9th century (d. 911) cited the [[Byzantine lyra]], in his lexicographical discussion of instruments as a bowed instrument equivalent to the Arab [[rab\u0101b]] and typical instrument of the Byzantines along with the ''urghun'' ([[Organ (music)|organ]]),<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.medievalhistories.com/early-medieval-organs/|title=Early Medieval Organs \u2013 Medieval Histories|date=2014-07-30|work=Medieval Histories|access-date=2017-09-19|language=en-US}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=September 2017}}<!--Source does establish a connection between Byzantium and organs in the Carolingian Empire, but does not mention the name \"urghun\", nor are the lyra or rebab named or described.--> ''shilyani'' (probably a type of [[harp]] or [[lyre]]) and the ''salandj'' (probably a [[bagpipe]]).<ref name=Kartomi124>{{harvnb|Kartomi|1990|p=124.}}</ref> The [[hurdy-gurdy]] was (and still is) a mechanical [[violin]] using a rosined wooden wheel attached to a crank to \"bow\" its strings. Instruments without sound boxes like the [[jew's harp]] were also popular. Early versions of the [[Organ (music)|pipe organ]], [[fiddle]] (or [[vielle]]), and a precursor to the modern [[trombone]] (called the [[sackbut]]) were used.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n===Genres===\n{{further|Gregorian chant|Ars nova|Organum|Motet|Madrigal (music)|Canon (music)|Ballata}}\nMedieval music was composed and, for some vocal and instrumental music, [[musical improvisation|improvised]] for many different [[music genre]]s (styles of music). Medieval music created for [[sacred music|sacred]] (church use) and [[secular music|secular]] (non-religious use) was typically written by composers,{{sfn|Hoppin|1978|p=256}} except for some sacred vocal and secular instrumental music which was [[Music improvisation|improvised]] (made up on-the-spot). During the [[Early Middle Ages|earlier medieval period]], the [[liturgy|liturgical]] genre, predominantly [[Gregorian chant]] done by monks, was [[Monophony|monophonic]] (\"monophonic\" means a single melodic line, without a harmony part or instrumental accompaniment).{{sfn|Hoppin|1978|p=57}} [[Polyphony|Polyphonic]] genres, in which multiple independent melodic lines are performed simultaneously, began to develop during the [[High Middle Ages|high medieval era]], becoming prevalent by the later 13th and early 14th century. The development of polyphonic forms, with different voices interweaving, is often associated with the late Medieval [[Ars nova]] style which flourished in the 1300s. The Ars Nova, which means \"new art\" was an innovative style of writing music that served as a key transition from the medieval music style to the more expressive styles of the post-1400s Renaissance music era.\n\nThe earliest innovations upon monophonic plainchant were [[heterophony|heterophonic]]. \"Heterophony\" is the performance of the same melody by two different performers at the same time, in which each performer slightly alters the ornaments she or he is using. Another simple form of heterophony is for singers to sing the same shape of melody, but with one person singing the melody and a second person singing the melody at a higher or lower pitch. [[Organum]], for example, expanded upon plainchant melody using an accompanying line, sung at a fixed [[interval (music)|interval]] (often a [[perfect fifth]] or [[perfect fourth]] away from the main melody), with a resulting alternation between a simple form of polyphony and monophony.<ref>Vanderbilt University Online Reference Book for Medieval Studies{{Full citation needed|date=January 2018}}<!--Online sources require URLs.--></ref> The principles of organum date back to an anonymous 9th century tract, the ''[[Musica enchiriadis]]'', which established the tradition of duplicating a preexisting plainchant in parallel motion at the interval of an octave, a fifth or a fourth.{{sfn|Hoppin|1978|p=189}}\n\nOf greater sophistication was the [[motet]], which developed from the [[Clausula (music)|clausula]] genre of medieval [[plainchant]]. The motet would become the most popular form of medieval polyphony.{{sfn|Yudkin|1989|pp=382, 391}} While early motets were liturgical or sacred (designed for use in a church service), by the end of the thirteenth century the genre had expanded to include secular topics, such as [[courtly love]]. Courtly love was the respectful veneration of a lady from afar by an amorous, noble man. Many popular motets had lyrics about a man's love and adoration of beautiful, noble and much-admired woman.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nThe Medieval motet developed during the [[Renaissance music]] era (after 1400). During the Renaissance, the Italian secular genre of the [[Madrigal (music)|Madrigal]] became popular. Similar to the polyphonic character of the motet, madrigals featured greater fluidity and motion in the leading melody line. The madrigal form also gave rise to polyphonic [[Canon (music)|canons]] (songs in which multiple singers sing the same melody, but starting at different times), especially in Italy where they were called ''caccie.'' These were three-part secular pieces, which featured the two higher voices in canon, with an underlying instrumental long-note accompaniment.{{sfn|Yudkin|1989|p=529}}\n\nFinally, purely instrumental music also developed during this period, both in the context of a growing theatrical tradition and for [[Court (royal)|court]] performances for the aristocracy. Dance music, often improvised around familiar tropes, was the largest purely instrumental genre.{{sfn|Yudkin|1989|p=434}} The secular [[Ballata]], which became very popular in [[Trecento]] Italy, had its origins, for instance, in medieval instrumental dance music.{{sfn|Yudkin|1989|p=523}}\n\n===Theory and notation===\nDuring the Medieval period the foundation was laid for the notational and theoretical practices that would shape Western music into the norms that developed during the [[Common practice period|common practice era]]. The most obvious of these is the development of a comprehensive [[music notation]]al system; however the theoretical advances, particularly in regard to rhythm and polyphony, are equally important to the development of Western music.\n\n====Notation====\n[[File:Gregorian chant.gif|frame|A sample of [[Kyrie|K\u00fdrie El\u00e9ison]] XI (Orbis Factor) from the ''Liber Usualis''. The modern \"neumes\" on the staff above the text indicate the pitches of the [[melody]]. [//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Kyrie_XI_%28Orbis_Factor%29_sample.ogg Listen] to it interpreted.]]\nThe earliest Medieval music did not have any kind of notational system. The tunes were primarily monophonic (a single [[melody]] without [[accompaniment]]) and transmitted by oral tradition.{{sfn|Hoppin|1978|p=57}}  As Rome tried to centralize the various liturgies and establish the Roman rite as the primary church tradition the need to transmit these chant melodies across vast distances effectively was equally glaring.{{sfn|Seay|1965|p=41}} So long as music could only be taught to people \"by ear,\" it limited the ability of the church to get different regions to sing the same melodies, since each new person would have to spend time with a person who already knew a song and learn it \"by ear.\" The first step to fix this problem came with the introduction of various signs written above the chant texts to indicate direction of pitch movement, called ''[[neumes]]''.{{sfn|Hoppin|1978|p=57}}\n\nThe origin of ''neumes'' is unclear and subject to some debate; however, most scholars agree that their closest ancestors are the classic Greek and Roman grammatical signs that indicated important points of declamation by recording the rise and fall of the voice.{{sfn|Parrish|1957|p=4}} The two basic signs of the classical grammarians were the ''acutus'', /, indicating a raising of the voice, and the ''gravis'', \\, indicating a lowering of the voice. A singer reading a chant text with neume markings would be able to get a general sense of whether the melody line went up in pitch, stayed the same, or went down in pitch. For a singer who already knew a song, seeing the written neume markings above the text could help to jog his or her memory about how the melody went. However, a singer reading a chant text with neume markings would not be able to [[sight read]] a song which he or she had never heard sung before.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nThese neumes eventually evolved into the basic symbols for ''neumatic'' notation, the ''virga'' (or \"rod\") which indicates a higher note and still looked like the ''acutus'' from which it came; and the ''punctum'' (or \"dot\") which indicates a lower note and, as the name suggests, reduced the ''gravis'' symbol to a point.{{sfn|Parrish|1957|p=4}} Thus the ''acutus'' and the ''gravis'' could be combined to represent graphical vocal inflections on the syllable.{{sfn|Parrish|1957|p=4}} This kind of notation seems to have developed no earlier than the eighth century, but by the ninth it was firmly established as the primary method of musical notation.{{sfn|Hoppin|1978|p=58}} The basic notation of the ''virga'' and the ''punctum'' remained the symbols for individual notes, but other ''neumes'' soon developed which showed several notes joined together. These new ''neumes''\u2014called ligatures\u2014are essentially combinations of the two original signs.{{sfn|Parrish|1957|p=5}}\n\nThe first music notation was the use of dots over the lyrics to a chant, with some dots being higher or lower, giving the reader a general sense of the direction of the melody. However, this form of notation only served as a memory aid for a singer who already knew the melody.{{sfn|Seay|1965|p=40}} This basic ''neumatic'' notation could only specify the number of notes and whether they moved up or down. There was no way to indicate exact pitch, any rhythm, or even the starting note. These limitations are further indication that the ''neumes'' were developed as tools to support the practice of oral tradition, rather than to supplant it. However, even though it started as a mere memory aid, the worth of having more specific notation soon became evident.{{sfn|Hoppin|1978|p=58}}\n\nThe next development in musical notation was \"heighted ''neumes''\", in which ''neumes'' were carefully placed at different heights in relation to each other. This allowed the ''neumes'' to give a rough indication of the size of a given interval as well as the direction. This quickly led to one or two lines, each representing a particular note, being placed on the music with all of the ''neumes'' relating to the earlier ones. At first, these lines had no particular meaning and instead had a letter placed at the beginning indicating which note was represented. However, the lines indicating middle C and the F a fifth below slowly became most common. Having been at first merely scratched on the parchment, the lines now were drawn in two different colored inks: usually red for F, and yellow or green for C. This was the beginning of the musical staff.{{sfn|Hoppin|1978|pp=59\u201360}} The completion of the four-line staff is usually credited to [[Guido of Arezzo|Guido d\u2019 Arezzo]] (c. 1000\u20131050), one of the most important musical theorists of the Middle Ages. While older sources attribute the development of the staff to Guido, some modern scholars suggest that he acted more as a codifier of a system that was already being developed. Either way, this new notation allowed a singer to learn pieces completely unknown to him in a much shorter amount of time.{{sfn|Seay|1965|p=41}}{{sfn|Hoppin|1978|p=60}} However, even though chant notation had progressed in many ways, one fundamental problem remained: rhythm. The ''neumatic'' notational system, even in its fully developed state, did not clearly define any kind of rhythm for the singing of notes.{{sfn|Hoppin|1978|p=89}}\n\n====Music theory====\n{{expand section|date=December 2014}}\nThe [[music theory]] of the Medieval period saw several advances over previous practice both in regard to tonal material, texture, and rhythm.\n\n=====Rhythm=====\n[[File:Perotin - Alleluia nativitas.jpg|thumb|P\u00e9rotin, \"Alleluia nativitas\", in the third rhythmic mode.]]\nConcerning [[rhythm]], this period had several dramatic changes in both its conception and notation. During the early Medieval period there was no method to notate rhythm, and thus the rhythmical practice of this early music is subject to heated debate among scholars.{{sfn|Hoppin|1978|p=89}} The first kind of written rhythmic system developed during the 13th century and was based on a series of modes. This rhythmic plan was codified by the music theorist [[Johannes de Garlandia (music theorist)|Johannes de Garlandia]], author of the ''[[De Mensurabili Musica]]'' (c.1250), the treatise which defined and most completely elucidated these [[rhythmic mode]]s.<ref>Christensen (2002), p. 628.</ref> In his treatise Johannes de Garlandia describes six ''species'' of mode, or six different ways in which longs and breves can be arranged. Each mode establishes a rhythmic pattern in beats (or ''tempora'') within a common unit of three ''tempora'' (a ''perfectio'') that is repeated again and again. Furthermore, notation without text is based on chains of [[Ligature (music)|''ligature''s]] (the characteristic notations by which groups of notes are bound to one another).\n\nThe rhythmic mode can generally be determined by the patterns of ligatures used.<ref>Christensen (2002), pp. 629\u201330.</ref> Once a rhythmic mode had been assigned to a melodic line, there was generally little deviation from that mode, although rhythmic adjustments could be indicated by changes in the expected pattern of ligatures, even to the extent of changing to another rhythmic mode.{{sfn|Ultan|1977|p=10}} The next step forward concerning rhythm came from the [[Germany|German]] theorist [[Franco of Cologne]]. In his treatise ''[[Ars cantus mensurabilis]]'' (\"The Art of Mensurable Music\"), written around 1280, he describes a system of notation in which differently shaped notes have entirely different rhythmic values. This is a striking change from the earlier system of de Garlandia. Whereas before the length of the individual note could only be gathered from the mode itself, this new inverted relationship made the mode dependent upon\u2014and determined by\u2014the individual notes or ''figurae'' that have incontrovertible durational values,<ref>Christensen (2002), p. 632.</ref> an innovation which had a massive impact on the subsequent history of European music. Most of the surviving notated music of the 13th century uses the rhythmic modes as defined by Garlandia. The step in the evolution of rhythm came after the turn of the 13th century with the development of the ''Ars Nova'' style.\n\nThe theorist who is most well recognized in regard to this new style is [[Philippe de Vitry]], famous for writing the ''[[Ars Nova]]'' (\"New Art\") treatise around 1320. This treatise on music gave its name to the style of this entire era.{{sfn|Yudkin|1989|p=458}} In some ways the modern system of rhythmic notation began with Vitry, who completely broke free from the older idea of the rhythmic modes. The notational predecessors of modern time meters also originate in the ''Ars Nova''. This new style was clearly built upon the work of Franco of Cologne. In Franco's system, the relationship between a [[Double whole note|breve]] and a [[Whole note|semibreves]] (that is, half breves) was equivalent to that between a breve and a long: and, since for him ''modus'' was always perfect (grouped in threes), the ''tempus'' or beat was also inherently perfect and therefore contained three semibreves. Sometimes the context of the mode would require a group of only two semibreves, however, these two semibreves would always be one of normal length and one of double length, thereby taking the same space of time, and thus preserving the perfect subdivision of the ''tempus''.{{sfn|Caldwell|1978|p=160}} This ternary division held for all note values. In contrast, the ''Ars Nova'' period introduced two important changes: the first was an even smaller subdivision of notes (semibreves, could now be divided into ''[[Minim (music)|minim]]''), and the second was the development of \"mensuration.\"\n\nMensurations could be combined in various manners to produce metrical groupings. These groupings of mensurations are the precursors of simple and compound meter.<ref name=\"Christensen635\">Christensen (2002), p. 635.</ref> By the time of ''Ars Nova'', the perfect division of the ''tempus'' was not the only option as duple divisions became more accepted. For Vitry the breve could be divided, for an entire composition, or section of one, into groups of two or three smaller semibreves. This way, the ''tempus'' (the term that came to denote the division of the breve) could be either \"perfect\" (''tempus perfectum''), with ternary subdivision, or \"imperfect\" (''tempus imperfectum''), with binary subdivision.{{sfn|Hoppin|1978|pp=354\u201355}} In a similar fashion, the semibreve's division (termed ''prolation'') could be divided into three ''minima'' (''[[prolation|prolatio]] perfectus'' or major prolation) or two ''minima'' (''prolatio imperfectus'' or minor prolation) and, at the higher level, the [[Longa (music)|longs]] division (called ''modus'') could be three or two breves (''[[Rhythmic mode|modus]] perfectus'' or perfect mode, or ''modus imperfectus'' or imperfect mode respectively).{{sfn|Ultan|1977|pp=62\u201363.}}{{sfn|Hoppin|1978|p=355}} Vitry took this a step further by indicating the proper division of a given piece at the beginning through the use of a \"mensuration sign\", equivalent to our modern \"time signature\".{{sfn|Seay|1965|p=131}}\n\n''Tempus perfectum'' was indicated by a circle, while ''tempus imperfectum'' was denoted by a half-circle{{sfn|Seay|1965|p=131}} (the current symbol {{music|common-time}}, used as an alternative for the {{music|time|4|4}} time signature, is actually a holdover of this symbol, not a letter ''C'' as an abbreviation for \"common time\", as popularly believed). While many of these innovations are ascribed to Vitry, and somewhat present in the ''Ars Nova'' treatise, it was a contemporary\u2014and personal acquaintance\u2014of de Vitry, named [[Jean de Muris|Johannes de Muris]] ([[Jehan des Mars]]) who offered the most comprehensive and systematic treatment of the new mensural innovations of the ''Ars Nova''<ref name=\"Christensen635\"/> (for a brief explanation of the mensural notation in general, see the article [[Renaissance music#Theory and notation|Renaissance music]]). Many scholars, citing a lack of positive attributory evidence, now consider \"Vitry's\" treatise to be anonymous, but this does not diminish its importance for the history of rhythmic notation. However, this makes the first definitely identifiable scholar to accept and explain the mensural system to be de Muris, who can be said to have done for it what Garlandia did for the rhythmic modes.\n\nFor the duration of the medieval period, most music would be composed primarily in perfect tempus, with special effects created by sections of imperfect tempus; there is a great current controversy among musicologists as to whether such sections were performed with a breve of equal length or whether it changed, and if so, at what proportion. This ''Ars Nova'' style remained the primary rhythmical system until the highly syncopated works of the ''[[Ars subtilior]]'' at the end of the 14th century, characterized by extremes of notational and rhythmic complexity.{{sfn|Hoppin|1978|p=472}} This sub-genera pushed the rhythmic freedom provided by ''Ars Nova'' to its limits, with some compositions having different voices written in different mensurations simultaneously. The rhythmic complexity that was realized in this music is comparable to that in the 20th century.{{sfn|McKinnon|1990|p=237}}\n\n=====Polyphony=====\n[[File:P\u00e9rotin - Viderunt omnes.jpg|thumb|right|170px|[[P\u00e9rotin]]'s ''Viderunt omnes'', ca. 13th century.]]\nOf equal importance to the overall history of western music theory were the textural changes that came with the advent of polyphony. This practice shaped western music into the harmonically dominated music that we know today.{{sfn|Hoppin|1978|p=187}} The first accounts of this textural development were found in two anonymous yet widely circulated treatises on music, the ''[[Musica enchiriadis|Musica]]'' and the ''[[Scolica enchiriadis]]''. These texts are dated to sometime within the last half of the ninth century.<ref name=\"Christensen 2002, p. 480\">Christensen (2002), p. 480.</ref> The treatises describe a technique that seemed already to be well established in practice.<ref name=\"Christensen 2002, p. 480\"/> This early polyphony is based on three simple and three compound intervals. The first group comprises fourths, fifths, and octaves; while the second group has octave-plus-fourths, octave-plus-fifths, and double octaves.<ref name=\"Christensen 2002, p. 480\"/> This new practice is given the name ''[[organum]]'' by the author of the treatises.<ref name=\"Christensen 2002, p. 480\"/> ''Organum'' can further be classified depending on the time period in which it was written. The early ''organum'' as described in the ''enchiriadis'' can be termed \"strict ''organum''\" {{sfn|Ultan|1977|p=52}} Strict ''organum'' can, in turn, be subdivided into two types: ''diapente'' (organum at the interval of a fifth) and ''diatesseron'' (organum at the interval of a fourth).{{sfn|Ultan|1977|p=52}} However, both of these kinds of strict ''organum'' had problems with the musical rules of the time. If either of them paralleled an original chant for too long (depending on the mode) a [[tritone]] would result.{{sfn|Ultan|1977|p=53}}\n\nThis problem was somewhat overcome with the use of a second type of ''organum''. This second style of ''organum'' was called \"free ''organum''\". Its distinguishing factor is that the parts did not have to move only in parallel motion, but could also move in oblique, or contrary motion. This made it much easier to avoid the dreaded tritone.{{sfn|Ultan|1977|p=55}} The final style of ''organum'' that developed was known as \"[[melismatic]] ''organum''\", which was a rather dramatic departure from the rest of the polyphonic music up to this point. This new style was not note against note, but was rather one sustained line accompanied by a florid melismatic line.{{sfn|Ultan|1977|p=58}} This final kind of ''organum'' was also incorporated by the most famous polyphonic composer of this time\u2014[[L\u00e9onin]]. He united this style with measured [[discant]] passages, which used the rhythmic modes to create the pinnacle of ''organum'' composition.{{sfn|Ultan|1977|p=58}} This final stage of ''organum'' is sometimes referred to as [[Notre Dame school]] of polyphony, since that was where L\u00e9onin (and his student [[P\u00e9rotin]]) were stationed. Furthermore, this kind of polyphony influenced all subsequent styles, with the later polyphonic genera of motets starting as a trope of existing Notre Dame ''organums''.\n\nAnother important element of Medieval music theory was the system by which pitches were arranged and understood. During the Middle Ages, this systematic arrangement of a series of whole steps and half steps, what we now call a [[Musical scale|scale]], was known as a [[Gregorian mode|mode]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} The modal system worked like the scales of today, insomuch that it provided the rules and material for melodic writing.{{sfn|Seay|1965|p=32}} The eight church modes are: ''[[Dorian mode|Dorian]]'', ''[[Hypodorian]]'', ''[[Phrygian mode|Phrygian]]'', ''[[Hypophrygian mode|Hypophrygian]]'', ''[[Lydian mode|Lydian]]'', ''[[Hypolydian mode|Hypolydian]]'', ''[[Mixolydian]]'', and ''[[Hypomixolydian mode|Hypomixolydian]]''.{{sfn|Seay|1965|p=33}} Much of the information concerning these modes, as well as the practical application of them, was codified in the 11th century by the theorist [[Johannes Afflighemensis]]. In his work he describes three defining elements to each mode: the final (or ''finalis)'', the reciting tone (''tenor'' or ''confinalis''), and the range (or ''ambitus''). The ''finalis'' is the tone that serves as the focal point for the mode and, as the name suggests, is almost always used as the final tone. The reciting tone is the tone that serves as the primary focal point in the melody (particularly internally). It is generally also the tone most often repeated in the piece, and finally the range delimits the upper and lower tones for a given mode.{{sfn|Ultan|1977|p=25}} The eight modes can be further divided into four categories based on their final (''finalis'').\n\nMedieval theorists called these pairs ''maneriae'' and labeled them according to the Greek ordinal numbers. Those modes that have d, e, f, and g as their final are put into the groups ''protus'', ''deuterus'', ''tritus'', and ''tetrardus'' respectively.{{sfn|Hoppin|1978|p=64}} These can then be divided further based on whether the mode is \"authentic\" or \"plagal.\" These distinctions deal with the range of the mode in relation to the final. The authentic modes have a range that is about an octave (one tone above or below is allowed) and start on the final, whereas the plagal modes, while still covering about an octave, start a perfect fourth below the authentic.<ref>Christensen (2002), p. 311.</ref> Another interesting aspect of the modal system is the universal allowance for altering B{{music|natural}} to B{{music|flat}} no matter what the mode.{{sfn|Hoppin|1978|p=66}}{{Verify source|date=May 2017}}<!--Does Hoppin really say this? If so, then Mixolydian could have either a major or a minor third, and Ionian could have either a major or minor seventh.--> The inclusion of this tone has several uses, but one that seems particularly common is in order to avoid melodic difficulties caused, once again, by the tritone.{{sfn|Seay|1965|p=34}}\n\nThese ecclesiastical modes, although they have Greek names, have little relationship to the modes as set out by Greek theorists. Rather, most of the terminology seems to be a misappropriation on the part of the medieval theorists{{sfn|Seay|1965|p=33}} Although the church modes have no relation to the ancient Greek modes, the overabundance of Greek terminology does point to an interesting possible origin in the liturgical melodies of the [[Byzantine music|Byzantine]] tradition. This system is called ''[[octoechos]]'' and is also divided into eight categories, called ''echoi''.<ref>Christensen (2002), p. 310.</ref> \n \nFor specific medieval music theorists, see also: [[Isidore of Seville]], [[Aurelian of R\u00e9\u00f4me]], [[Odo of Cluny]], [[Guido of Arezzo]], [[Hermannus Contractus]], [[Johannes Cotto]] (Johannes Afflighemensis), [[Johannes de Muris]], [[Franco of Cologne]], [[Johannes de Garlandia (music theorist)|Johannes de Garlandia]] (Johannes Gallicus), [[Anonymous IV]], [[Marchetto da Padova]] (Marchettus of Padua), [[Jacob of Li\u00e8ge|Jacques of Li\u00e8ge]], [[Johannes de Grocheo]], [[Petrus de Cruce]] (Pierre de la Croix), and [[Philippe de Vitry]].\n\n==Early medieval music (before 1150)==\n\n===Early chant traditions===\n{{main|Plainsong}}\n{{See also|Gregorian chant}}\n[[Gregorian chant|Chant]] (or [[plainsong]]) is a [[texture (music)|monophonic]] sacred (single, unaccompanied melody) form which represents the earliest known music of the Christian church. Chant developed separately in several European centres. Although the most important were [[Rome]], [[Hispania]], [[Gaul]], [[Milan]], and [[Ireland]], there were others as well. These styles were all developed to support the regional liturgies used when celebrating the Mass there. Each area developed its own chant and rules for celebration. In Spain and [[Portugal]], [[Mozarabic chant]] was used and shows the influence of [[Music of North Africa|North African music]]. The Mozarabic liturgy even survived through [[Muslim]] rule, though this was an isolated strand and this music was later suppressed in an attempt to enforce conformity on the entire liturgy. In Milan, [[Ambrosian chant]], named after [[St. Ambrose]], was the standard, while [[Beneventan chant]] developed around [[Benevento]], another Italian liturgical center. [[Gallican chant]] was used in Gaul, and [[Celtic chant]] in Ireland and Great Britain.\n\nAround AD 1011, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] wanted to standardize the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] and chant across its empire. At this time, Rome was the religious centre of western Europe, and Paris was the political centre. The standardization effort consisted mainly of combining these two ([[Roman Rite|Roman]] and [[Gallican rite|Gallican]]) regional liturgies. [[Pope Gregory I]] (540\u2013604) and [[Charlemagne]] (742\u2013814) sent trained singers throughout the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (800|962\u20131806) to teach this new form of chant.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Music in the Middle Ages|last=Lorde|first=Suzanne|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}</ref> This body of chant became known as [[Gregorian chant|Gregorian Chant]], named after [[Pope Gregory I]]. By the 12th and 13th centuries, Gregorian chant had superseded all the other Western chant traditions, with the exception of the Ambrosian chant in Milan and the Mozarabic chant in a few specially designated Spanish chapels. [[Hildegard von Bingen]] (1098\u20131179) was the earliest known female composer. She wrote many monophonic works for the Catholic Church, almost all of them for female voices.\n\n===Early polyphony: organum===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}\n{{main|Organum}}\nAround the end of the 9th century, singers in monasteries such as [[Abbey of St. Gall|St. Gall]] in [[Switzerland]] began experimenting with adding another part to the chant, generally a [[human voice|voice]] in [[contrary motion|parallel motion]], singing mostly in perfect [[perfect fourth|fourths]] or [[perfect fifth|fifths]] above the original tune (see [[interval (music)|interval]]). This development is called [[organum]] and represents the beginnings of [[counterpoint]] and, ultimately, [[harmony]]. Over the next several centuries, organum developed in several ways.\n\nThe most significant of these developments was the creation of \"florid organum\" around 1100, sometimes known as the [[school of St. Martial]] (named after a monastery in south-central France, which contains the best-preserved manuscript of this repertory). In \"florid organum\" the original tune would be sung in long notes while an accompanying voice would sing many notes to each one of the original, often in a highly elaborate fashion, all the while emphasizing the perfect [[consonance and dissonance|consonances]] (fourths, fifths and octaves), as in the earlier organa. Later developments of organum occurred in England, where the interval of the [[Interval (music)|third]] was particularly favoured, and where organa were likely improvised against an existing chant melody, and at [[Notre Dame school|Notre Dame]] in Paris, which was to be the centre of musical creative activity throughout the thirteenth century.\n\nMuch of the music from the early medieval period is [[Anonymous work|anonymous]]. Some of the names may have been poets and lyric writers, and the tunes for which they wrote words may have been composed by others. Attribution of monophonic music of the medieval period is not always reliable. Surviving manuscripts from this period include the [[Musica Enchiriadis]], [[Codex Calixtinus]] of [[Santiago de Compostela]], the [[Magnus Liber]], and the [[Winchester Troper]]. For information about specific composers or poets writing during the early medieval period, see [[Pope Gregory I]], [[Godric of Finchale|St. Godric]], [[Hildegard of Bingen]], [[Hucbald]], [[Notker of St Gall|Notker Balbulus]], [[Odo of Arezzo]], [[Odo of Cluny]], and [[Tuotilo|Tutilo]].\n\n===Liturgical drama===\n{{Main|Liturgical drama}}\nAnother musical tradition of Europe originating during the early Middle Ages was the [[liturgical drama]].\n\nLiturgical drama developed possibly in the 10th century from the tropes\u2014poetic embellishments of the liturgical texts. One of the tropes, the so-called Quem Quaeritis, belonging to the liturgy of Easter morning, developed into a short play around the year 950.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} The oldest surviving written source is the Winchester Troper. Around the year 1000 it was sung all around Europe.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}<!--Who claims the Winchester Troper was sung all over Europe?-->\n\nShortly,{{Clarify|date=September 2018}} a similar Christmas play was developed, musically and textually following the Easter one, and other plays followed.\n\nThere is a controversy among musicologists as to the instrumental accompaniment of such plays, given that the stage directions, very elaborate and precise in other respects, do not request any participation of instruments.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} These dramas were performed by monks, nuns and priests.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} In contrast to secular plays, which were spoken, the liturgical drama was always sung.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Many have been preserved sufficiently to allow modern reconstruction and performance (for example the ''[[Play of Daniel]]'', which has been recently recorded at least ten times).\n\n===Goliards===\n{{main|Goliards}}\nThe [[Goliard]]s were [[itinerant poet]]-musicians of Europe from the tenth to the middle of the thirteenth century. Most were scholars or [[ecclesiastic]]s, and they wrote and sang in Latin. Although many of the poems have survived, very little of the music has. They were possibly influential\u2014even decisively so\u2014on the [[troubadour]]-[[trouv\u00e8re]] tradition which was to follow. Most of their poetry is secular and, while some of the songs celebrate religious ideals, others are frankly profane, dealing with drunkenness, debauchery and lechery. One of the most important extant sources of Goliards chansons is the [[Carmina Burana]].<ref>Anderson, Gordon A., and Thomas B.

Sometimes the music of this period is called the Parisian school, or Parisian organum, and represents the beginning of what is conventionally known as ''[[Ars antiqua]]''. This was the period in which [[rhythm]]ic notation first appeared in western music, mainly a context-based method of rhythmic notation known as the [[rhythmic mode]]s.\n\nThis was also the period in which concepts of [[musical form|formal]] structure developed which were attentive to proportion, [[musical texture|texture]], and architectural effect. Composers of the period alternated florid and discant organum (more note-against-note, as opposed to the succession of many-note melismas against long-held notes found in the florid type), and created several new musical forms: [[Clausula (music)|clausula]]e, which were [[melisma]]tic sections of organa extracted and fitted with new words and further musical elaboration; [[conductus]], which were songs for one or more voices to be sung rhythmically, most likely in a procession of some sort; and [[trope (music)|tropes]], which were additions of new words and sometimes new music to sections of older chant. All of these genres save one were based upon chant; that is, one of the voices, (usually three, though sometimes four) nearly always the lowest (the tenor at this point) sang a chant melody, though with freely composed note-lengths, over which the other voices sang organum. The exception to this method was the conductus, a two-voice composition that was freely composed in its entirety.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nThe [[motet]], one of the most important musical forms of the high Middle Ages and Renaissance, developed initially during the Notre Dame period out of the clausula, especially the form using multiple voices as elaborated by [[P\u00e9rotin]], who paved the way for this particularly by replacing many of his predecessor (as canon of the cathedral) [[L\u00e9onin]]'s lengthy florid clausulae with substitutes in a discant style. Gradually, there came to be entire books of these substitutes, available to be fitted in and out of the various chants. Since, in fact, there were more than can possibly have been used in context, it is probable that the clausulae came to be performed independently, either in other parts of the mass, or in private devotions. The clausula, thus practised, became the motet when troped with non-liturgical words, and this further developed into a form of great elaboration, sophistication and subtlety in the fourteenth century, the period of ''Ars nova''. Surviving manuscripts from this era include the [[Montpellier Codex]], [[Bamberg Codex]], and [[Las Huelgas Codex]].\n\nComposers of this time include [[L\u00e9onin]], [[P\u00e9rotin]], [[W. de Wycombe]], [[Adam de St. Victor]], and [[Petrus de Cruce]] (Pierre de la Croix). Petrus is credited with the innovation of writing more than three semibreves to fit the length of a breve. Coming before the innovation of imperfect tempus, this practice inaugurated the era of what are now called \"Petronian\" motets. These late 13th-century works are in three to four parts and have multiple texts sung simultaneously. Originally, the tenor line (from the Latin ''[[tenere]]'', \"to hold\") held a preexisting liturgical chant line in the original Latin, while the text of the one, two, or even three voices above, called the ''voces organales'', provided commentary on the liturgical subject either in Latin or in the vernacular French. The rhythmic values of the ''voces organales'' decreased as the parts multiplied, with the ''duplum'' (the part above the tenor) having smaller rhythmic values than the tenor, the ''triplum'' (the line above the ''duplum'') having smaller rhythmic values than the ''duplum'', and so on. As time went by, the texts of the ''voces organales'' became increasingly secular in nature and had less and less overt connection to the liturgical text in the tenor line.<ref>Hindley (1971), pp.66\u201369.</ref>\n\nThe Petronian motet is a highly complex genre, given its mixture of several semibreve breves with rhythmic modes and sometimes (with increasing frequency) substitution of secular songs for chant in the tenor. Indeed, ever-increasing rhythmic complexity would be a fundamental characteristic of the 14th century, though music in France, Italy, and England would take quite different paths during that time.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n===Cantigas de Santa Maria===\n{{main|Cantigas de Santa Maria}}\nThe '''''Cantigas de Santa Maria''''' (\"Canticles of St. Mary\") are 420 poems with musical notation, written in [[Galician-Portuguese]] during the reign of [[Alfonso X of Castile|Alfonso X ''El Sabio'']] (1221\u20131284) and often attributed to him. It is one of the largest collections of monophonic (solo) songs from the [[Middle Ages]] and is characterized by the mention of the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] in every song, while every tenth song is a hymn. The manuscripts have survived in four codices: two at [[El Escorial]], one at [[Madrid]]'s [[Biblioteca Nacional de Espa\u00f1a|National Library]], and one in [[Florence, Italy]]. Some have colored [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] showing pairs of musicians playing a wide variety of [[musical instrument|instruments]].\n\n===Troubadours and trouv\u00e8res===\n{{main|Troubadour}}\n[[File:Troubadours berlin.jpg|thumb|200px|Trobadours, 14th century]]\nThe music of the [[troubadour]]s and [[trouv\u00e8re]]s was a vernacular tradition of monophonic secular song, probably accompanied by instruments, sung by professional, occasionally itinerant, musicians who were as skilled as poets as they were singers and instrumentalists. The language of the troubadours was [[Occitan]] (also known as the [[langue d'oc]], or Proven\u00e7al); the language of the trouv\u00e8res was Old French (also known as [[langue d'oil]]). The period of the troubadours corresponded to the flowering of cultural life in [[Provence]] which lasted through the twelfth century and into the first decade of the thirteenth. Typical subjects of troubadour song were [[war]], [[chivalry]] and [[courtly love]]\u2014the love of an idealized woman from afar. The period of the troubadours wound down after the [[Albigensian Crusade]], the fierce campaign by [[Pope Innocent III]] to eliminate the [[Cathar]] heresy (and northern barons' desire to appropriate the wealth of the south). Surviving troubadours went either to [[Portugal]], Spain, northern Italy or northern France (where the trouv\u00e8re tradition lived on), where their skills and techniques contributed to the later developments of secular musical culture in those places.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe trouv\u00e8res and troubadours shared similar musical styes, but the trouv\u00e8res were generally noblemen.<ref name=\":0\" /> The music of the trouv\u00e8res was similar to that of the troubadours, but was able to survive into the thirteenth century unaffected by the Albigensian Crusade. Most of the more than two thousand surviving trouv\u00e8re songs include music, and show a sophistication as great as that of the poetry it accompanies.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nThe [[Minnesang|Minnesinger]] tradition was the [[Germany|Germanic]] counterpart to the activity of the troubadours and trouv\u00e8res to the west. Unfortunately, few sources survive from the time; the sources of Minnesang are mostly from two or three centuries after the peak of the movement, leading to some controversy over the accuracy of these sources.{{sfn|Gibbs and Johnson|1997|p=225}} Among the Minnesingers with surviving music are [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]], [[Walther von der Vogelweide]], and [[Niedhart von Reuenthal]].\n\n===Trovadorismo===\n{{main|Galician-Portuguese lyric}}\n\nIn the Middle Ages, Galician-Portuguese was the language used in nearly all of Iberia for lyric poetry.{{sfn|Chandler and Schwartz|1991|p=197}} From this language derive both modern Galician and Portuguese. The Galician-Portuguese school, which was influenced to some extent (mainly in certain formal aspects) by the Occitan troubadours, is first documented at the end of the twelfth century and lasted until the middle of the fourteenth.\n\nThe earliest extant composition in this school is usually agreed to be Ora faz ost' o senhor de Navarra by the Portuguese Jo\u00e3o Soares de Paiva, usually dated just before or after 1200. The troubadours of the movement, not to be confused with the Occitan troubadours (who frequented courts in nearby Le\u00f3n and Castile), wrote almost entirely cantigas. Beginning probably around the middle of the thirteenth century, these songs, known also as cantares or trovas, began to be compiled in collections known as cancioneiros (songbooks). Three such anthologies are known: the Cancioneiro da Ajuda, the Cancioneiro Colocci-Brancuti (or Cancioneiro da Biblioteca Nacional de Lisboa), and the Cancioneiro da Vaticana. In addition to these there is the priceless collection of over 400 Galician-Portuguese cantigas in the Cantigas de Santa Maria, which tradition attributes to Alfonso X.\n\nThe Galician-Portuguese cantigas can be divided into three basic genres: male-voiced love poetry, called cantigas de amor (or cantigas d'amor) female-voiced love poetry, called cantigas de amigo (cantigas d'amigo); and poetry of insult and mockery called cantigas d'escarnho e de mal dizer. All three are lyric genres in the technical sense that they were strophic songs with either musical accompaniment or introduction on a stringed instrument. But all three genres also have dramatic elements, leading early scholars to characterize them as lyric-dramatic.\n\nThe origins of the cantigas d'amor are usually traced to Proven\u00e7al and Old French lyric poetry, but formally and rhetorically they are quite different. The cantigas d'amigo are probably rooted in a native song tradition ({{harvnb|Lang|1894|loc={{Page needed|date=August 2016}}}}; {{harvnb|Micha\u00eblis|1904|loc={{Page needed|date=August 2016}}}}), though this view has been contested. The cantigas d'escarnho e maldizer may also (according to Lang) have deep local roots.

The ''Roman de Fauvel'' is a satire on abuses in the medieval church, and is filled with medieval motets, [[Lai (poetic form)|lai]]s, [[Rondeau (music)|rondeaux]] and other new secular forms. While most of the music is anonymous, it contains several pieces by [[Philippe de Vitry]], one of the first composers of the [[isorhythm]]ic motet, a development which distinguishes the fourteenth century. The isorhythmic motet was perfected by [[Guillaume de Machaut]], the finest composer of the time.\n\nDuring the ''Ars nova'' era, secular music acquired a polyphonic sophistication formerly found only in sacred music, a development not surprising considering the secular character of the early Renaissance (while this music is typically considered \"medieval\", the social forces that produced it were responsible for the beginning of the literary and artistic Renaissance in Italy\u2014the distinction between Middle Ages and Renaissance is a blurry one, especially considering arts as different as music and painting). The term \"''Ars nova''\" (new art, or new technique) was coined by Philippe de Vitry in his treatise of that name (probably written in 1322), in order to distinguish the practice from the music of the immediately preceding age.\n\nThe dominant secular genre of the Ars Nova was the ''[[chanson]]'', as it would continue to be in France for another two centuries. These chansons were composed in musical forms corresponding to the poetry they set, which were in the so-called ''[[formes fixes]]'' of ''rondeau'', ''ballade'', and ''virelai''. These forms significantly affected the development of musical structure in ways that are felt even today; for example, the ''ouvert-clos'' rhyme-scheme shared by all three demanded a musical realization which contributed directly to the modern notion of antecedent and consequent phrases. It was in this period, too, in which began the long tradition of setting the mass ordinary. This tradition started around mid-century with isolated or paired settings of Kyries, Glorias, etc., but [[Guillaume de Machaut|Machaut]] composed what is thought to be the first complete mass conceived as one composition. The sound world of Ars Nova music is very much one of linear primacy and rhythmic complexity. \"Resting\" intervals are the fifth and octave, with thirds and sixths considered dissonances. Leaps of more than a sixth in individual voices are not uncommon, leading to speculation of instrumental participation at least in secular performance. Surviving French manuscripts include the [[Ivrea Codex]] and the [[Apt Codex]].\n\nFor information about specific French composers writing in late medieval era, see [[Jehan de Lescurel]], [[Philippe de Vitry]], [[Guillaume de Machaut]], [[Borlet]], [[Solage]], and [[Francois Andrieu|Fran\u00e7ois Andrieu]].\n\n===Italy: ''Trecento''===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}\n{{main|Music of the Trecento}}\nMost of the music of ''Ars nova'' was French in origin; however, the term is often loosely applied to all of the music of the fourteenth century, especially to include the secular music in Italy. There this period was often referred to as ''[[Trecento]]''. Italian music has always been known for its lyrical or melodic character, and this goes back to the 14th century in many respects. Italian secular music of this time (what little surviving liturgical music there is, is similar to the French except for somewhat different notation) featured what has been called the ''cantalina'' style, with a florid top voice supported by two (or even one; a fair amount of Italian Trecento music is for only two voices) that are more regular and slower moving. This type of texture remained a feature of Italian music in the popular 15th and 16th century secular genres as well, and was an important influence on the eventual development of the trio texture that revolutionized music in the 17th.\n\nThere were three main forms for secular works in the Trecento. One was the [[Trecento-Madrigal|madrigal]], not the same as that of 150\u2013250 years later, but with a verse/refrain-like form. Three-line stanzas, each with different words, alternated with a two-line ''[[ritornello]]'', with the same text at each appearance. Perhaps we can see the seeds of the subsequent late-Renaissance and Baroque ritornello in this device; it too returns again and again, recognizable each time, in contrast with its surrounding disparate sections. Another form, the ''caccia'' (\"chase,\") was written for two voices in a canon at the unison. Sometimes, this form also featured a ritornello, which was occasionally also in a canonic style. Usually, the name of this genre provided a double meaning, since the texts of caccia were primarily about hunts and related outdoor activities, or at least action-filled scenes. The third main form was the ''ballata'', which was roughly equivalent to the French ''virelai''.\n\nSurviving Italian manuscripts include the [[Squarcialupi Codex]] and the [[Rossi Codex]]. For information about specific Italian composers writing in the late medieval era, see [[Francesco Landini]], [[Gherardello da Firenze]], [[Andrea da Firenze]], [[Lorenzo da Firenze]], [[Giovanni da Firenze]] (aka Giovanni da Cascia), [[Bartolino da Padova]], [[Jacopo da Bologna]], [[Donato da Cascia]], [[Lorenzo Masini]], [[Niccol\u00f2 da Perugia]], and [[Maestro Piero]].\n\n===Germany: ''Geisslerlieder''===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}\n{{main|Geisslerlieder}}\nThe [[Geisslerlieder]] were the songs of wandering bands of [[flagellant]]s, who sought to appease the wrath of an angry God by penitential music accompanied by mortification of their bodies. There were two separate periods of activity of Geisslerlied: one around the middle of the thirteenth century, from which, unfortunately, no music survives (although numerous lyrics do); and another from 1349, for which both words and music survive intact due to the attention of a single priest who wrote about the movement and recorded its music. This second period corresponds to the spread of the [[Black Death]] in Europe, and documents one of the most terrible events in European history. Both periods of Geisslerlied activity were mainly in Germany.\n\n===Mannerism and ''Ars subtilior''===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}\n{{main|Ars subtilior}}\n[[File:CordierColor.jpg|thumb|right|The chanson ''Belle, bonne, sage'' by [[Baude Cordier]], an ''Ars subtilior'' piece included in the [[Chantilly Codex]]]]\nAs often seen at the end of any musical era, the end of the medieval era is marked by a highly manneristic style known as ''[[Ars subtilior]]''. In some ways, this was an attempt to meld the French and Italian styles. This music was highly stylized, with a rhythmic complexity that was not matched until the 20th century. In fact, not only was the rhythmic complexity of this repertoire largely unmatched for five and a half centuries, with extreme syncopations, mensural trickery, and even examples of ''augenmusik'' (such as a chanson by [[Baude Cordier]] written out in manuscript in the shape of a heart), but also its melodic material was quite complex as well, particularly in its interaction with the rhythmic structures. Already discussed under Ars Nova has been the practice of isorhythm, which continued to develop through late-century and in fact did not achieve its highest degree of sophistication until early in the 15th century. Instead of using isorhythmic techniques in one or two voices, or trading them among voices, some works came to feature a pervading isorhythmic texture which rivals the integral serialism of the 20th century in its systematic ordering of rhythmic and tonal elements. The term \"mannerism\" was applied by later scholars, as it often is, in response to an impression of sophistication being practised for its own sake, a malady which some authors have felt infected the ''Ars subtilior''.\n\nOne of the most important extant sources of Ars Subtilior chansons is the [[Chantilly Codex]]. For information about specific composers writing music in ''[[Ars subtilior]]'' style, see [[Anthonello de Caserta]], [[Philippus de Caserta]] (aka Philipoctus de Caserta), [[Johannes Ciconia]], [[Matteo da Perugia]], [[Lorenzo da Firenze]], [[Grimace (composer)|Grimace]], [[Jacob Senleches]], and [[Baude Cordier]].\n\n===Transitioning to the Renaissance===\n[[File:Busnois mass.jpg|thumb|left|200px| Manuscript of the Mass ''Missa O Crux Lignum'' by [[Antoine Busnois]] (ca. 1450).]]\nDemarcating the end of the medieval era and the beginning of the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance era]], with regard to the composition of music, is difficult. While the music of the fourteenth century is fairly obviously medieval in conception, the music of the early fifteenth century is often conceived as belonging to a transitional period, not only retaining some of the ideals of the end of the Middle Ages (such as a type of polyphonic writing in which the parts differ widely from each other in character, as each has its specific textural function), but also showing some of the characteristic traits of the Renaissance (such as the increasingly international style developing through the diffusion of Franco-Flemish musicians throughout Europe, and in terms of texture an increasing equality of parts). Music historians do not agree on when the Renaissance era began, but most historians agree that England was still a medieval society in the early fifteenth century (see [[Middle Ages#Periodization issues|periodization issues]] of the Middle Ages). While there is no consensus, 1400 is a useful marker, because it was around that time that the Renaissance came into full swing in [[Italy]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nThe increasing reliance on the interval of the third as a consonance is one of the most pronounced features of transition into the Renaissance. Polyphony, in use since the 12th century, became increasingly elaborate with highly independent voices throughout the 14th century. With [[John Dunstaple]] and other English composers, partly through the local technique of [[fauxbourdon|faburden]] (an improvisatory process in which a chant melody and a written part predominantly in parallel sixths above it are ornamented by one sung in perfect fourths below the latter, and which later took hold on the continent as \"fauxbordon\"), the interval of the third emerges as an important musical development; because of this ''[[Contenance Angloise]]'' (\"English countenance\"), English composers' music is often regarded as the first to sound less truly bizarre to 2000s-era audiences who are not trained in music history.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nEnglish stylistic tendencies in this regard had come to fruition and began to influence continental composers as early as the 1420s, as can be seen in works of the young [[Guillaume Dufay|Dufay]], among others. While the [[Hundred Years' War]] continued, English nobles, armies, their chapels and retinues, and therefore some of their composers, travelled in France and performed their music there; it must also of course be remembered that the English controlled portions of northern France at this time. English manuscripts include the [[Worcester Fragments]], the Old St. Andrews Music Book, the [[Old Hall Manuscript]], and Egerton Manuscript. For information about specific composers who are considered transitional between the medieval and the Renaissance, see [[Zacara da Teramo]], [[Paolo da Firenze]], [[Giovanni Mazzuoli]], [[Antonio da Cividale]], [[Antonius Romanus]], [[Bartolomeo da Bologna]], [[Roy Henry]], [[Arnold de Lantins]], [[Leonel Power]], and [[John Dunstaple]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nAn early composer from the [[Franco-Flemish School]] of the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] was [[Johannes Ockeghem]] (1410/1425 \u20131497). He was the most famous member of the Franco-Flemish School in the last half of the 15th century, and is often considered{{Weasel inline|date=May 2017}} the most influential composer between [[Guillaume Dufay|Dufay]] and [[Josquin des Prez]]. Ockeghem probably studied with [[Gilles Binchois]], and at least was closely associated with him at the Burgundian court. [[Antoine Busnois]] wrote a motet in honor of Ockeghem. Ockeghem is a direct link from the Burgundian style to the next generation of Netherlanders, such as [[Jacob Obrecht|Obrecht]] and Josquin. A strong influence on [[Josquin des Prez]] and the subsequent generation of Netherlanders, Ockeghem was famous throughout Europe [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]] for his expressive music, although he was equally renowned for his technical prowess.<ref name=\"Brown & Stein, p61-71\">{{harvnb|Brown and Stein|pp=61\u201371}}</ref>\n\n==Study and vocational training==\nThe [[Schola Cantorum Basiliensis]], university for old music in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]], provides a full-time practical study course for the music of the Middle Ages.<ref>[https://www.fhnw.ch/en/degree-programmes/music/schola-cantorum-basiliensis Schola Cantorum Basiliensis degree programme]</ref>\n\nA two-year vocational training for musicians is offered at the academy [http://www.burg-fuersteneck.de Burg F\u00fcrsteneck] in [[Germany]].\n\n[[Kees Boeke (musician)|Kees Boeke]] coordinates a new Master of Music- Musik des Mittelalters und des Renaissance for both singers and instrumentalists in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100107033243/http://www.mh-trossingen.de/english/studies/early-music/medieval-and-renaissance-music.html Staatliche Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik Trossingen], also in Germany.\n\n==Influence in contemporary music==\nThe musical styles of [[L\u00e9onin]] and [[P\u00e9rotin]] influenced 20th century [[Minimal music|minimalist]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnlutheradams.com/interview/endsoftheearth.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809090637/http://www.johnlutheradams.com/interview/endsoftheearth.html |archivedate=9 August 2011 }}</ref> composers such as [[Steve Reich]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://music.indiana.edu/html/som/theory/activities/colloquium.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120712215823/http://music.indiana.edu/html/som/theory/activities/colloquium.shtml |archivedate=12 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://public.wsu.edu/~delahoyd/20th/minimalism.html|title=Minimalism|work=wsu.edu}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=May 2017}}<!--Source compares one of Reich's works to Perotin, but does not claim there was any influence.-->\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Cantus coronatus]]\n* [[History of music]]\n* [[List of early music ensembles]]\n* [[List of Medieval composers]]\n* [[Medieval dance]]\n* [[Neo-Medieval music]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{wikicite|ref={{harvid|Brown and Stein}}|reference=Brown, and Stein. {{Full citation needed|date=May 2017}}}}\n* {{wikicite|ref={{harvid|Caldwell|1978}}|reference=Caldwell, John (1978), ''Medieval Music''.

He was secretary of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] (RGS) between 1863 and 1888,<ref name=EB1911>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Markham, Sir Clements Robert|volume=17 |pages=734\u2013735}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title=MARKHAM, Sir Clements Robert|journal=Who's Who|year=1905|volume= 57|page=1073|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iEVLAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA1073}}</ref> and later served as the Society's president for a further 12&nbsp;years. In the latter capacity he was mainly responsible for organising the [[British National Antarctic Expedition]] of 1901\u20131904, and for launching the polar career of [[Robert Falcon Scott]].\n\nMarkham began his career as a [[Royal Navy]] cadet and [[midshipman]], during which time he went to the [[Arctic]] with {{HMS|Assistance|1850|6}} in one of the many searches for [[Franklin's lost expedition]]. Later, Markham served as a geographer to the [[India Office]], and was responsible for the collection of [[cinchona]] plants from their native Peruvian forests, and their transplantation in India. By this means the Indian government acquired a home source from which [[quinine]] could be extracted. Markham also served as geographer to Sir [[Robert Napier, 1st Baron Napier of Magdala|Robert Napier]]'s Abyssinian expeditionary force, and was present in 1868, at the [[Battle of Magdala|fall of Magdala]].\n\nThe main achievement of Markham's RGS presidency was the revival at the end of the 19th century of British interest in Antarctic exploration, after a 50-year interval. He had strong and determined ideas about how the National Antarctic Expedition should be organised, and fought hard to ensure that it was run primarily as a naval enterprise, under Scott's command. To do this he overcame hostility and opposition from much of the scientific community. In the years following the expedition he continued to champion Scott's career, to the extent of disregarding or disparaging the achievements of other contemporary explorers.\n\nAll his life Markham was a constant traveller and a prolific writer, his works including histories, travel accounts and biographies. He authored many papers and reports for the RGS, and did much editing and translation work for the [[Hakluyt Society]], of which he also became president in 1890.<ref name=EB1911/> He received public and academic honours, and was recognised as a major influence on the discipline of geography, although it was acknowledged that much of his work was based on enthusiasm rather than scholarship. Among the geographical features bearing his name is Antarctica's [[Mount Markham]], named after him by Scott in 1902.\n\n== Early life ==\nMarkham was born on 20 July 1830, at [[Stillingfleet]], Yorkshire, the second son of the Reverend [[David Frederick Markham]], then [[vicar]] of Stillingfleet.

The boy made a favourable impression on the admiral, and the meeting led to the offer of a cadetship in the [[Royal Navy]]. Accordingly, on 28&nbsp;June 1844, Markham travelled to [[Portsmouth]] to join Seymour's flagship, {{HMS|Collingwood|1841|6}}. ''Collingwood'' was being fitted out for an extended voyage to the Pacific Ocean where Seymour was to assume command of the Pacific station.<ref>A. Markham, pp.&nbsp;17\u201326.</ref> This tour of duty lasted for almost four years. The ship reached the Chilean port of [[Valpara\u00edso]], the headquarters of the Pacific station on 15&nbsp;December 1844, after a cruise that incorporated visits to [[Rio de Janeiro]] and the [[Falkland Islands]], and a stormy passage in the [[Southern Ocean]].<ref name= AHM28/> Markham's social connections assured him of a relatively comfortable time; he was frequently invited to dine with the admiral, whose wife and daughters were on board.<ref name= AHM28>A. Markham, pp.&nbsp;28\u201335.</ref>\n\n[[File:CadetMarkham.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Markham as a naval cadet in 1844]]\nAfter a few weeks' respite in Valparaiso, ''Collingwood'' sailed again, this time for [[Callao]], the main port on the Peruvian coast, giving Markham his first experience of a country that would figure prominently in his later career.<ref>A. Markham, pp.&nbsp;38\u201347.</ref> During the next two years ''Collingwood'' cruised in the Pacific, visiting the [[Sandwich Islands]], Mexico, and [[Tahiti]], where Markham attempted to assist the nationalist rebels against their French governor.<ref>A. Markham, pp.&nbsp;64\u201369.</ref> On 25&nbsp;June 1846, Markham passed the examination for [[midshipman]], being placed third in a group of ten. The long periods spent in Chilean and Peruvian ports had also enabled him to learn Spanish.<ref name = Baigent/>\n\nTowards the end of the voyage, Markham experienced growing doubts about a conventional naval career; he now desired above all to be an explorer and a geographer. On arrival in Portsmouth in July 1848 he informed his father of his wish to leave the navy, but was persuaded to stay.<ref>A. Markham, pp.&nbsp;97\u201399.</ref> After a brief period of service in the Mediterranean Markham experienced months of inactivity while based at [[Spithead]] and the [[Cobh|Cove of Cork]], which further diminished his interest in the service.<ref>A. Markham, p.&nbsp;106.</ref> However, early in 1850, he learned that a squadron of four ships was being assembled to undertake a new search for the lost Arctic expedition of Sir [[John Franklin]].<ref>Coleman, p.&nbsp;51.</ref> Markham used his family's influence to secure a place in this venture, and in April 1850, was informed of his appointment to {{HMS|Assistance|1850|6}}, one of the squadron's two principal vessels.<ref>A.

Markham's ship ''Assistance'' was captained by [[Erasmus Ommanney]].<ref>Coleman, pp.&nbsp;51\u201352.</ref> Markham, as the youngest member of the expedition and its only midshipman, had a limited role, but carefully noted every detail of expedition life in his journal.

Here the ships dispersed to search different areas for signs of the vanished expedition. On 23&nbsp;August, Ommanney sighted a [[cairn]], and discovered packing materials nearby which bore the name of \"Goldner\", Franklin's canned meat supplier. Together with other odds and ends of abandoned equipment, these fragments were the first traces of Franklin that anyone had found.<ref name= Coleman54/> A few days later, on [[Beechey Island]], the party came across three graves, which proved to be those of members of Franklin's crew who had died between January and April 1846.<ref name= Coleman54/>\n\nSearches continued until the ships were laid up for the long Arctic winter. During this enforced rest there were lectures and classes for the crew, and various theatrical diversions in which Markham was able to display his \"great histrionic talent\".<ref name= AHM119/> He did much reading, mainly Arctic history and classical literature, and thought about a possible return visit to Peru, a country which had captivated him during the ''Collingwood'' voyage.<ref name=AHM119>A. Markham, pp.&nbsp;119\u2013123.</ref> When spring returned, a series of sledging expeditions was launched to search for further signs of the missing crews. Markham played a full part in these activities,<ref>Described by Clements Markham in ''The Lands of Silence'', pp.&nbsp;255\u2013260.</ref> which produced no further evidence of Franklin, but led to the mapping of hundreds of miles of previously uncharted coast.<ref>Coleman, pp.&nbsp;63\u201368.</ref> The expedition returned to England in early October 1851.<ref>Coleman, p.&nbsp;73.</ref>\n\nImmediately on his return to England, Markham informed his father of his determination to leave the navy. One of the reasons for his disaffection was the severity of the corporal punishment that was constantly administered for what in his view were trivial offences. He had been in trouble during his ''Collingwood'' service for attempting to prevent the flogging of a crewman.<ref name= AHM49>A. Markham, pp.&nbsp;49\u201351.</ref> He had also become disenchanted by the idleness that had occupied long periods of his service. With some regret the elder Markham consented to his son's request, and after taking and passing the gunnery part of the examination for the rank of lieutenant, Markham resigned from the service at the end of 1851.<ref name= AHM127>A.

After crossing the [[isthmus of Panama]], he sailed for Callao, finally arriving there on 16&nbsp;October. He set out for the Peruvian interior on 7&nbsp;December 1852, heading across the [[Andes]] towards his goal, the ancient [[Inca]] city of [[Cusco|Cuzco]].<ref>A. Markham, pp.&nbsp;132\u2013137.</ref> On the way, Markham paused for nearly a month in the town of [[Ayacucho]], to study the local culture and increase his knowledge of the [[Quechua people]]. He then travelled on towards Cuzco, and after crossing a swinging bridge\u2014the Apurimac Bridge\u2014suspended {{convert|300|ft|m}} above the raging [[Apur\u00edmac River]], he and his party passed through fertile valleys which brought them finally to the city of Cuzco, on 20&nbsp;March 1853.<ref>A. Markham, pp.&nbsp;147\u2013152.</ref>\n\nMarkham remained in the city for several weeks, researching Inca history, describing in his journal the many buildings and ruins that he visited. During the course of an excursion to nearby towns and ruins he reached the area of San Miguel, La Mar, Ayacucho, where he first learned of the properties of the [[cinchona]] plant, a source of [[quinine]], cultivated in that vicinity.<ref>A. Markham, p.&nbsp;158.</ref> He finally left Cuzco on 18&nbsp;May, accompanied by a party of six who, like him, were returning to Lima. Their journey took them southwards, descending the mountains to the city of [[Arequipa]], a former Spanish colonial settlement with a mixture of native and European architecture.<ref>{{cite web|title= Historical Centre of the City of Arequipa|website = UNESCO|url= https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1016|accessdate= 30 April 2009}}</ref> The city is overlooked by the conical volcano [[El Misti|Mount Misti]], which Markham likened to [[Mount Fuji]] in Japan.

Because the geography of the country was so little known, it was decided that an experienced traveller with map-making skills should accompany the force, hence Markham's appointment.<ref name= AHM210/>\n\nNapier's troops arrived at [[Gulf of Zula|Annesley Bay]] in the [[Red Sea]], early in 1868. Markham was attached to the force's headquarters staff, with responsibility for general survey work and in particular the selection of the route to [[Battle of Magdala|Magdala]], the king's mountain stronghold. Markham also acted as the party's naturalist, reporting on the species of wildlife encountered during the {{convert|400|mi|km|adj=on}} march southward from the coast.<ref name= AHM210/> He accompanied Napier to the walls of Magdala, which was stormed on 10&nbsp;April 1868.

Markham accepted, and left with the convoy on 29&nbsp;March 1875. He was gone for three months, remaining with ''Alert'' as far as [[Disko Island]] in Baffin Bay.\n\nHe wrote of this journey: \"I never had a happier cruise&nbsp;... a nobler set of fellows never sailed together.\"<ref>A.

The Society soon became the centre of his geographical interests, and in 1863 he was appointed its honorary secretary, a position he was to hold for 25&nbsp;years.<ref name= Baigent/>\n\nIn addition to his work in promoting the Nares Arctic expedition, Markham followed the work of other Arctic explorers, organising a reception in 1880, for the Swedish explorer [[Adolf Erik Nordenski\u00f6ld]] after the latter's successful navigation of the [[North-East Passage]], and monitoring the progress of the American expeditions of [[Adolphus Greely]] and [[George W. DeLong]]. Release from the India Office provided Markham with more time for travel. He made regular trips to Europe, and in 1885, went to America, where he met with President [[Grover Cleveland]] in the [[White House]]. Throughout his secretaryship Markham was a prolific writer of travel books and biographies, and of many papers presented to the RGS and elsewhere.\n\nHe was the author of the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' (ninth edition) article entitled \"Progress of Geographical Discovery\". He also wrote popular histories. Within the RGS Markham was responsible for the revision of the Society's standard ''Hints to Travellers'', and for relaunching the journal ''Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society'' in a much livelier format.<ref>Jones, pp.&nbsp;33\u201336.</ref>Markham conducted the ''Geographical Magazine'' from 1872\u20131878, when it became merged in the ''Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society''.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn parallel with his RGS duties Markham served as secretary of the [[Hakluyt Society]] until 1886, subsequently becoming that society's president. As part of his work for this body, Markham was responsible for many translations from Spanish into English of rare accounts of travel, in particular those relating to Peru. In time scholars would express doubts about the quality of some of these translations, finding them prepared in haste and lacking in rigour.<ref name= Baigent/> Nevertheless, this work ran to 22&nbsp;volumes in the society's publications. In 1873, Markham had been elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]],<ref name= Baigent/> and in subsequent years received several overseas honours, including the Portuguese [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]] and the [[Order of the Rose]] of Brazil. He briefly considered, but did not pursue, the idea of a parliamentary career.<ref>A. Markham, pp.&nbsp;267\u2013268.</ref>\n\nMarkham maintained his interest in the navy, particularly in the training of its officers. He often visited the merchant officer training vessels, {{HMS|Conway|school ship|6}} and [[Thames Nautical Training College|HMS ''Worcester'']], and became a member of the latter's governing body. In early 1887 he accepted an invitation from his cousin Albert Markham, who now commanded the Royal Navy's training squadron, to join the squadron at its station in the West Indies. Markham spent three months aboard the flagship {{HMS|Active|1869|6}}, during which, on 1&nbsp;March 1887, he had his first encounter with [[Robert Falcon Scott]], who was serving as a midshipman aboard HMS ''Rover''. Scott was victorious in a race between [[cutter (boat)|cutters]], an event that was noted and remembered by Markham.<ref>Crane, p.&nbsp;82.</ref>\n\n=== President, 1893\u20131905 ===\n[[File:Clements_Markham_(cropped).jpg|thumb|Markham as President of the Royal Geographical Society]]\nIn May 1888, Markham resigned from his position as RGS Secretary, finding himself at odds with the Society's new policies which appeared to favour education over exploration.<ref>Jones, p.&nbsp;38.</ref> On his retirement he was awarded the Society's [[Gold Medal (RGS)|Founder's Medal]] for what were described at the presentation ceremony as his \"incomparable services to the Society\".<ref>A.

There were further cruises with the training squadron, and extended visits to the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and the Mediterranean. In 1893, during the course of one of these journeys, Markham was elected ''in absentia'' president of the society. This unexpected elevation was the result of a dispute within the Society over the question of women members, about which Markham had kept silent. When in July 1893, the issue was put to a special general meeting, the proposal to admit women was narrowly defeated despite an overwhelming postal ballot in favour.

This Congress passed a unanimous resolution:\n\n{{quote|[That] the exploration of the Antarctic Regions is the greatest piece of geographical exploration still to be undertaken. That, in view of the additions to knowledge in almost every branch of science which would result from such a scientific exploration, the Congress recommends that the scientific societies throughout the world should urge, in whatever way seems to them most effective, that this work should be undertaken before the close of the century.<ref name= Jones57>Jones, pp.&nbsp;57\u201359.</ref>}}\n\nThe joint committee organising the British response to this resolution contained a difference of view. Murray and the Royal Society argued for a largely civilian expedition, directed and staffed by scientists, while Markham and most of the RGS contingent saw a National Antarctic Expedition as a means of reviving naval glories, and wanted the expedition organised accordingly.<ref name=\"Crane75\"/> Markham's tenacity finally won the day when in 1900 he secured the appointment of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Robert Falcon Scott, by then a torpedo lieutenant on {{HMS|Majestic|1895|6}}, as the expedition's overall commander.

In 1898, after three years' effort, only a fraction of what was required had been promised. Meanwhile, the Anglo-Norwegian explorer [[Carsten Borchgrevink]] had obtained a sum of \u00a340,000 (over \u00a33&nbsp;million in 2008)<ref name= MW/> from publisher [[George Newnes]], to finance a private Antarctic venture.<ref name= Jones57/> Markham was furious, believing that funds were being diverted from his own project, and denounced Borchgrevink as \"evasive, a liar and a fraud\".<ref>E. Huxley, p.&nbsp;35.</ref>\n\nHe was equally hostile to [[William Speirs Bruce]], the Scottish explorer who had written to Markham asking to join the National Antarctic Expedition. On receiving no confirmation of an appointment, Bruce obtained finance from the Scottish [[Coats baronets]] family and organised his own [[Scottish National Antarctic Expedition]]. Markham accused Bruce of \"mischievous rivalry\", and of attempting to \"cripple the National Expedition&nbsp;... in order to get up a scheme for yourself\".<ref>Speak, pp.&nbsp;71\u201375.</ref> The Scottish expedition duly sailed, but Markham remained unforgiving towards it, and used his influence to ensure that its participants received no Polar Medals on their return.<ref>Speak, pp.&nbsp;127\u2013131.</ref>\n\nA substantial private donation and a government grant finally allowed the National Antarctic Expedition to proceed. A new ship, the {{RRS|Discovery||2}}, was built, and a mainly naval crew of officers and crewmen appointed, along with a scientific staff which was later described as \"underpowered\".<ref>Crane, p.&nbsp;279.</ref> ''Discovery'' sailed on 5&nbsp;August 1901, after an inspection by King [[Edward VII]], at which Markham was present to introduce Scott and the officers. The ship was gone for just over three years during which time, from a base in the [[Ross Sea]] area, significant explorations of this sector of Antarctica were carried out, along with an extensive scientific programme. Although it was reported by the ''Times'' as \"one of the most successful [expeditions] that ever ventured into the Polar regions, north or south,\"<ref>''Times'', 10&nbsp;September 1904, reported in Jones, p.&nbsp;68.</ref> it was largely ignored by the government of the day.<ref name= Jones72>Jones, p.&nbsp;72.</ref> Markham was criticised in official quarters for privately sanctioning a second season in the Antarctic, contrary to the original plan, and then being unable to raise funds for the expedition's relief in 1904.

He was 75&nbsp;years old; according to his biographer he felt that his active geographical life was now over. His 12&nbsp;years in the presidency was the longest period on record. He remained a member of the RGS Council, a vice-president,<ref>A. Markham, pp.&nbsp;339\u2013341.</ref> and he kept an active interest in Antarctic exploration, particularly in the two British expeditions which set out in the five years following his retirement.

He is said to have crossed out all favourable references to Shackleton in his own notes on the ''Discovery'' expedition,<ref>Riffenburgh, p.&nbsp;301.</ref> and to have virtually ignored Shackleton's achievements in a 1912 address to the British Association. He was equally dismissive in his history of Antarctic exploration, ''The Lands of Silence''&nbsp;\u2013 published posthumously in 1921).<ref>Riffenburgh, pp.&nbsp;300\u2013301.</ref>\n\nBy contrast, Markham remained on close personal terms with Scott and was godfather to the explorer's son, born 14&nbsp;September 1909 and named [[Peter Scott]] in the old man's honour.<ref>Crane, p.&nbsp;387.</ref> In his tribute to Scott in the preface to ''Scott's Last Expedition'' (1913), Markham describes Scott as \"among the most remarkable men of our time\", and talks of the \"beauty\" of his character. As Scott lay dying \"there was no thought for himself, only the earnest thought to give comfort and consolation to others.\"<ref>L. Huxley (ed) Vol&nbsp;I, p. vi.</ref> In one of the last letters written from his final camp, days from death, Scott wrote: \"Tell Sir Clements&nbsp;I thought much of him, and never regretted his putting me in command of the 'Discovery'.\"<ref>L.

He wrote biographies of the English kings [[Edward IV]] and [[Richard III]], and of his old naval friend Admiral Sir [[Leopold McClintock]]; he also kept up his editing and translating work.<ref name= Baigent/><ref>A. Markham, pp.&nbsp;341\u2013345.</ref> He continued to produce papers for the RGS, and remained president of the [[Hakluyt Society]] until 1910.<ref name= Baigent/> Markham continued to travel extensively in Europe, and in 1906 cruised with the Mediterranean squadron, where Scott was acting as flag captain to Rear Admiral [[George Egerton (Royal Navy officer)|George Egerton]]. When, in 1909, Scott announced his plans for a new Antarctic venture, the [[Terra Nova Expedition|''Terra Nova'' expedition]], Markham assisted with fundraising and served on the expedition's organising committee, arranging the deal which brought in Lieutenant \"Teddy\" Evans as second-in-command, in return for the abandonment of Evans's own expedition plans.<ref>Crane, p.&nbsp;401.</ref>\n\nMarkham was awarded honorary degrees from the [[University of Cambridge]] and [[University of Leeds]]. In conferring this latter degree, the [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] referred to Markham as \"a veteran in the service of mankind\", and recalled that he had been \"for sixty years the inspiration of English geographical science.\"<ref>A. Markham, pp.&nbsp;344, 351\u2013352.</ref> However, Markham did not altogether avoid controversy. In 1912, when [[Roald Amundsen]], conqueror of the South Pole, was invited by RGS president Leonard Darwin to dine with the Society, Markham resigned his council seat in protest.<ref>Jones, p.&nbsp;92.</ref>\n\nThe news of the death of Scott and his returning polar party reached Markham in February 1913, while he was staying in [[Estoril]].<ref name= AHM356>A. Markham, pp.&nbsp;356\u2013360.</ref> He returned to England, and assisted with the preparation of Scott's journals for publication.<ref>Jones, p.&nbsp;122.</ref> Scott's death was a heavy blow, but Markham continued to lead a busy life of writing and travelling. In 1915, he was present at the service in St Peter's Church, [[Binton]], near [[Stratford-upon-Avon]], where a window was dedicated to Scott and his companions; later that year he assisted at the unveiling of the Royal Navy's statue of Scott, in Waterloo Place, London.<ref name= AHM356/> Markham read his last paper for the RGS on 10&nbsp;June 1915, its title being \"The History of the Gradual Development of the Groundwork of Geographical Science\".<ref name= AHM356/>\n\n== Death and legacy ==\n[[File:Sir Clements Robert Markham Bust.jpg|thumb|upright|Bust of Markham by [[F.&nbsp;W.

He died the following day.<ref name= Baigent/> His last diary entry, a few days earlier, had recorded a visit from Peter Markham Scott.<ref name= AMH361>A. Markham, pp.&nbsp;361\u2013365.</ref>\n\nThe family received tributes from King [[George V]], who acknowledged the debt the country owed to Markham's life work of study and research; from the Royal Geographical Society and the other learned bodies with which Markham had been associated; from the Naval Commander-in-Chief at Devonport; and from [[Fridtjof Nansen]], the Norwegian Arctic explorer. Other messages were received from France, Italy, Denmark, Sweden, the United States, and from Arequipa in Peru.<ref name= AMH361/>\n\nMore critical assessments of Markham's life and work were to follow. [[Hugh Robert Mill]], Shackleton's first biographer and for many years the RGS librarian, referred to the dictatorial manner in which Markham had run the Society.<ref name= Baigent/> In time, questions would be raised about the accuracy of some of his Hakluyt translations, and about the evidence of haste in the preparation of other publications.<ref name= Baigent/> On a personal level he had made enemies as well as friends; [[Frank Debenham]], the geologist who served with both Scott and Shackleton, called Markham \"a dangerous old man\",<ref>Riffenburgh, p.&nbsp;293.</ref> while William Speirs Bruce wrote of Markham's \"malicious opposition to the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition\".<ref name= Speak130>Speak, pp.&nbsp;130\u2013131.</ref>\n\nBruce's colleague [[Robert Rudmose-Brown]] went further, calling Markham \"that old fool and humbug\".<ref>Speak, p.&nbsp;123.</ref> These protestations reflected Markham's protective attitude towards Scott; according to Bruce, \"Scott was Markham's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, and Markham thought it necessary, in order to uphold Scott, that I should be obliterated\". He added that \"Scott and I were always good friends, in spite of Markham.\"<ref name= Speak130/> Markham's writings on naval history have been criticised by modern scholars due to his nationalistic exaggeration of English sailors' achievements in the [[Age of Discoveries]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Maura|first1=Juan Francisco|title=El mito de \"John Cabot\"construcci\u00f3n brit\u00e1nica para reclamar la soberan\u00eda de Norteam\u00e9rica|journal=Cuadernos Hispanoamericanos|date=2016|issue=788|pages=4\u201325|url=http://www.aecid.es/Centro-Documentacion/Documentos/Publicaciones%20AECID/WEB_CHA_788_2016.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIt has been suggested that Markham's prejudices about polar travel, particularly his belief in the \"nobility\" of [[manhauling]], had been passed to Scott, to the detriment of all future British expeditions.<ref>Jones, pp.&nbsp;58, 72.</ref> Mill's measured opinion, that Markham was \"an enthusiast rather than a scholar\", has been asserted as a fair summary of his strengths and weaknesses, and as the basis for his influence on the discipline of geography in the late-19th and early-20th centuries.<ref name= Baigent/> He is commemorated by [[Mount Markham]], {{coord|82|51|S|161|21|E|type:mountain}}, in the Transantarctic range, discovered and named by Scott on his southern march during the ''Discovery'' expedition in 1902.<ref>Crane, p.&nbsp;213.</ref>\n\nThe [[Markham River]] in Papua New Guinea was named after him;<ref>Souter, p.&nbsp;77.</ref> Carsten Borchgrevink discovered and named Markham Island in the Ross Sea during his 1900 expedition,<ref>{{cite web|title= Markham Island|url= http://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/gaz/display_name.cfm?gaz_id=128441|website = Australian Antarctic Division|accessdate= 27 April 2009}}</ref> a gesture that was not, however, acknowledged by Markham.<ref>E.

He was secretary of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] (RGS) between 1863 and 1888,<ref name=EB1911>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Markham, Sir Clements Robert|volume=17 |pages=734\u2013735}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title=MARKHAM, Sir Clements Robert|journal=Who's Who|year=1905|volume= 57|page=1073|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iEVLAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA1073}}</ref> and later served as the Society's president for a further 12&nbsp;years. In the latter capacity he was mainly responsible for organising the [[British National Antarctic Expedition]] of 1901\u20131904, and for launching the polar career of [[Robert Falcon Scott]].\n\nMarkham began his career as a [[Royal Navy]] cadet and [[midshipman]], during which time he went to the [[Arctic]] with {{HMS|Assistance|1850|6}} in one of the many searches for [[Franklin's lost expedition]]. Later, Markham served as a geographer to the [[India Office]], and was responsible for the collection of [[cinchona]] plants from their native Peruvian forests, and their transplantation in India. By this means the Indian government acquired a home source from which [[quinine]] could be extracted. Markham also served as geographer to Sir [[Robert Napier, 1st Baron Napier of Magdala|Robert Napier]]'s Abyssinian expeditionary force, and was present in 1868, at the [[Battle of Magdala|fall of Magdala]].\n\nThe main achievement of Markham's RGS presidency was the revival at the end of the 19th century of British interest in Antarctic exploration, after a 50-year interval. He had strong and determined ideas about how the National Antarctic Expedition should be organised, and fought hard to ensure that it was run primarily as a naval enterprise, under Scott's command. To do this he overcame hostility and opposition from much of the scientific community. In the years following the expedition he continued to champion Scott's career, to the extent of disregarding or disparaging the achievements of other contemporary explorers.\n\nAll his life Markham was a constant traveller and a prolific writer, his works including histories, travel accounts and biographies. He authored many papers and reports for the RGS, and did much editing and translation work for the [[Hakluyt Society]], of which he also became president in 1890.<ref name=EB1911/> He received public and academic honours, and was recognised as a major influence on the discipline of geography, although it was acknowledged that much of his work was based on enthusiasm rather than scholarship. Among the geographical features bearing his name is Antarctica's [[Mount Markham]], named after him by Scott in 1902.\n\n== Early life ==\nMarkham was born on 20 July 1830, at [[Stillingfleet]], Yorkshire, the second son of the Reverend [[David Frederick Markham]], then [[vicar]] of Stillingfleet. The family were descendants of [[William Markham (bishop)|William Markham]], former [[Archbishop of York]]<ref>{{cite book|last = Markham|first = A.

Reportedly an apt pupil, he showed particular interest in geology and astronomy, and from an early age he wrote prolifically, an activity which filled much of his spare time.<ref name= AMH5>A. Markham, pp.&nbsp;5\u201311.</ref> At Westminster, which he found \"a wonderful and delightful place\", he developed a particular interest in boating, often acting as [[Coxswain (rowing)|coxswain]] in races on the [[River Thames]].<ref>A. Markham, pp.&nbsp;12\u201315.</ref>\n\n== Royal Navy ==\n\n=== Naval cadet, 1844\u20131850 ===\n[[File:HMS Collingwood (1841).jpg|thumb|{{HMS|Collingwood|1841|2}}, Markham's first ship]]\nIn May 1844, Markham was introduced by his aunt, the Countess of Mansfield, to Rear Admiral Sir [[George Seymour (Royal Navy officer)|George Seymour]], a [[Lord of the Admiralty]]. The boy made a favourable impression on the admiral, and the meeting led to the offer of a cadetship in the [[Royal Navy]]. Accordingly, on 28&nbsp;June 1844, Markham travelled to [[Portsmouth]] to join Seymour's flagship, {{HMS|Collingwood|1841|6}}. ''Collingwood'' was being fitted out for an extended voyage to the Pacific Ocean where Seymour was to assume command of the Pacific station.<ref>A. Markham, pp.&nbsp;17\u201326.</ref> This tour of duty lasted for almost four years. The ship reached the Chilean port of [[Valpara\u00edso]], the headquarters of the Pacific station on 15&nbsp;December 1844, after a cruise that incorporated visits to [[Rio de Janeiro]] and the [[Falkland Islands]], and a stormy passage in the [[Southern Ocean]].<ref name= AHM28/> Markham's social connections assured him of a relatively comfortable time; he was frequently invited to dine with the admiral, whose wife and daughters were on board.<ref name= AHM28>A. Markham, pp.&nbsp;28\u201335.</ref>\n\n[[File:CadetMarkham.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Markham as a naval cadet in 1844]]\nAfter a few weeks' respite in Valparaiso, ''Collingwood'' sailed again, this time for [[Callao]], the main port on the Peruvian coast, giving Markham his first experience of a country that would figure prominently in his later career.<ref>A. Markham, pp.&nbsp;38\u201347.</ref> During the next two years ''Collingwood'' cruised in the Pacific, visiting the [[Sandwich Islands]], Mexico, and [[Tahiti]], where Markham attempted to assist the nationalist rebels against their French governor.<ref>A. Markham, pp.&nbsp;64\u201369.</ref> On 25&nbsp;June 1846, Markham passed the examination for [[midshipman]], being placed third in a group of ten. The long periods spent in Chilean and Peruvian ports had also enabled him to learn Spanish.<ref name = Baigent/>\n\nTowards the end of the voyage, Markham experienced growing doubts about a conventional naval career; he now desired above all to be an explorer and a geographer. On arrival in Portsmouth in July 1848 he informed his father of his wish to leave the navy, but was persuaded to stay.<ref>A. Markham, pp.&nbsp;97\u201399.</ref> After a brief period of service in the Mediterranean Markham experienced months of inactivity while based at [[Spithead]] and the [[Cobh|Cove of Cork]], which further diminished his interest in the service.<ref>A. Markham, p.&nbsp;106.</ref> However, early in 1850, he learned that a squadron of four ships was being assembled to undertake a new search for the lost Arctic expedition of Sir [[John Franklin]].<ref>Coleman, p.&nbsp;51.</ref> Markham used his family's influence to secure a place in this venture, and in April 1850, was informed of his appointment to {{HMS|Assistance|1850|6}}, one of the squadron's two principal vessels.<ref>A. Markham, pp.&nbsp;108\u2013109.</ref>\n\n=== First Arctic voyage, 1850\u20131851 ===\n{{Main|Franklin's lost expedition}}\nSir [[John Franklin]] had left England in May 1845 with two ships, {{HMS|Erebus|1826|6}} and {{HMS|Terror|1813|6}}, in search of the [[Northwest Passage]]. The expedition was last seen on 29&nbsp;July, by [[whaling|whalers]] in the northern waters of [[Baffin Bay]], moored to an [[Drift ice|ice floe]] and waiting for the chance to sail westward.<ref>Coleman, p.&nbsp;19.</ref>\n\nThe hunt for the missing ships began two years later. The relief squadron which Markham joined was commanded by Captain [[Horatio Austin]] in {{HMS|Resolute|1850|6}}. Markham's ship ''Assistance'' was captained by [[Erasmus Ommanney]].<ref>Coleman, pp.&nbsp;51\u201352.</ref> Markham, as the youngest member of the expedition and its only midshipman, had a limited role, but carefully noted every detail of expedition life in his journal. The ships sailed on 4&nbsp;May 1850.<ref>A. Markham, p.&nbsp;119.</ref>\n\n[[File:BeecheyIsland Graves.jpg|thumb|A modern photograph of the graves discovered at Beechey Island in 1850]]\nAfter rounding the southernmost point of Greenland on 28&nbsp;May, the squadron proceeded northwards until stopped by ice in [[Melville Bay]] on 25&nbsp;June.<ref name= Coleman54>Coleman, pp.&nbsp;54\u201358.</ref> They were held here until 18&nbsp;August, when they were finally able to proceed west into [[Lancaster Sound]], the known route taken by Franklin. Here the ships dispersed to search different areas for signs of the vanished expedition. On 23&nbsp;August, Ommanney sighted a [[cairn]], and discovered packing materials nearby which bore the name of \"Goldner\", Franklin's canned meat supplier. Together with other odds and ends of abandoned equipment, these fragments were the first traces of Franklin that anyone had found.<ref name= Coleman54/> A few days later, on [[Beechey Island]], the party came across three graves, which proved to be those of members of Franklin's crew who had died between January and April 1846.<ref name= Coleman54/>\n\nSearches continued until the ships were laid up for the long Arctic winter. During this enforced rest there were lectures and classes for the crew, and various theatrical diversions in which Markham was able to display his \"great histrionic talent\".<ref name= AHM119/> He did much reading, mainly Arctic history and classical literature, and thought about a possible return visit to Peru, a country which had captivated him during the ''Collingwood'' voyage.<ref name=AHM119>A. Markham, pp.&nbsp;119\u2013123.</ref> When spring returned, a series of sledging expeditions was launched to search for further signs of the missing crews. Markham played a full part in these activities,<ref>Described by Clements Markham in ''The Lands of Silence'', pp.&nbsp;255\u2013260.</ref> which produced no further evidence of Franklin, but led to the mapping of hundreds of miles of previously uncharted coast.<ref>Coleman, pp.&nbsp;63\u201368.</ref> The expedition returned to England in early October 1851.<ref>Coleman, p.&nbsp;73.</ref>\n\nImmediately on his return to England, Markham informed his father of his determination to leave the navy. One of the reasons for his disaffection was the severity of the corporal punishment that was constantly administered for what in his view were trivial offences. He had been in trouble during his ''Collingwood'' service for attempting to prevent the flogging of a crewman.<ref name= AHM49>A. Markham, pp.&nbsp;49\u201351.</ref> He had also become disenchanted by the idleness that had occupied long periods of his service.

DeLong]]. Release from the India Office provided Markham with more time for travel. He made regular trips to Europe, and in 1885, went to America, where he met with President [[Grover Cleveland]] in the [[White House]]. Throughout his secretaryship Markham was a prolific writer of travel books and biographies, and of many papers presented to the RGS and elsewhere.\n\nHe was the author of the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' (ninth edition) article entitled \"Progress of Geographical Discovery\". He also wrote popular histories. Within the RGS Markham was responsible for the revision of the Society's standard ''Hints to Travellers'', and for relaunching the journal ''Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society'' in a much livelier format.<ref>Jones, pp.&nbsp;33\u201336.</ref>Markham conducted the ''Geographical Magazine'' from 1872\u20131878, when it became merged in the ''Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society''.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn parallel with his RGS duties Markham served as secretary of the [[Hakluyt Society]] until 1886, subsequently becoming that society's president. As part of his work for this body, Markham was responsible for many translations from Spanish into English of rare accounts of travel, in particular those relating to Peru. In time scholars would express doubts about the quality of some of these translations, finding them prepared in haste and lacking in rigour.<ref name= Baigent/> Nevertheless, this work ran to 22&nbsp;volumes in the society's publications. In 1873, Markham had been elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]],<ref name= Baigent/> and in subsequent years received several overseas honours, including the Portuguese [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]] and the [[Order of the Rose]] of Brazil. He briefly considered, but did not pursue, the idea of a parliamentary career.<ref>A. Markham, pp.&nbsp;267\u2013268.</ref>\n\nMarkham maintained his interest in the navy, particularly in the training of its officers. He often visited the merchant officer training vessels, {{HMS|Conway|school ship|6}} and [[Thames Nautical Training College|HMS ''Worcester'']], and became a member of the latter's governing body. In early 1887 he accepted an invitation from his cousin Albert Markham, who now commanded the Royal Navy's training squadron, to join the squadron at its station in the West Indies. Markham spent three months aboard the flagship {{HMS|Active|1869|6}}, during which, on 1&nbsp;March 1887, he had his first encounter with [[Robert Falcon Scott]], who was serving as a midshipman aboard HMS ''Rover''. Scott was victorious in a race between [[cutter (boat)|cutters]], an event that was noted and remembered by Markham.<ref>Crane, p.&nbsp;82.</ref>\n\n=== President, 1893\u20131905 ===\n[[File:Clements_Markham_(cropped).jpg|thumb|Markham as President of the Royal Geographical Society]]\nIn May 1888, Markham resigned from his position as RGS Secretary, finding himself at odds with the Society's new policies which appeared to favour education over exploration.<ref>Jones, p.&nbsp;38.</ref> On his retirement he was awarded the Society's [[Gold Medal (RGS)|Founder's Medal]] for what were described at the presentation ceremony as his \"incomparable services to the Society\".<ref>A.

There were further cruises with the training squadron, and extended visits to the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and the Mediterranean. In 1893, during the course of one of these journeys, Markham was elected ''in absentia'' president of the society. This unexpected elevation was the result of a dispute within the Society over the question of women members, about which Markham had kept silent. When in July 1893, the issue was put to a special general meeting, the proposal to admit women was narrowly defeated despite an overwhelming postal ballot in favour. In these circumstances the Society's President, Sir [[M. E. Grant Duff]], resigned his office. The 22&nbsp;existing women members were allowed to remain, but no more were admitted until January 1913 when the RGS changed its policy.<ref>{{cite web|title= RGS Additional Papers: election of women as Fellows|website= AIM25|url= http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cgi-bin/vcdf/detail?coll_id=10688&inst_id=10&nv1=search&nv2=|accessdate= 6 May 2009}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Markham was not the first choice as a replacement for Grant Duff\u2014other notable figures were approached\u2014he had kept out of the women members controversy and was broadly acceptable to the membership.<ref>Jones, pp.&nbsp;51\u201356.</ref> Shortly after his accession to the presidency, in recognition of his services to geography Markham was promoted [[Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath]], and became Sir Clements Markham.<ref name= Baigent/>\n\nIn a letter written many years later, Markham said that on the assumption of the presidency he had felt the need, after the dispute over women, to \"restore the Society's good name\" by the adoption of some great enterprise.

This Congress passed a unanimous resolution:\n\n{{quote|[That] the exploration of the Antarctic Regions is the greatest piece of geographical exploration still to be undertaken. That, in view of the additions to knowledge in almost every branch of science which would result from such a scientific exploration, the Congress recommends that the scientific societies throughout the world should urge, in whatever way seems to them most effective, that this work should be undertaken before the close of the century.<ref name= Jones57>Jones, pp.&nbsp;57\u201359.</ref>}}\n\nThe joint committee organising the British response to this resolution contained a difference of view. Murray and the Royal Society argued for a largely civilian expedition, directed and staffed by scientists, while Markham and most of the RGS contingent saw a National Antarctic Expedition as a means of reviving naval glories, and wanted the expedition organised accordingly.<ref name=\"Crane75\"/> Markham's tenacity finally won the day when in 1900 he secured the appointment of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Robert Falcon Scott, by then a torpedo lieutenant on {{HMS|Majestic|1895|6}}, as the expedition's overall commander.

In 1898, after three years' effort, only a fraction of what was required had been promised. Meanwhile, the Anglo-Norwegian explorer [[Carsten Borchgrevink]] had obtained a sum of \u00a340,000 (over \u00a33&nbsp;million in 2008)<ref name= MW/> from publisher [[George Newnes]], to finance a private Antarctic venture.<ref name= Jones57/> Markham was furious, believing that funds were being diverted from his own project, and denounced Borchgrevink as \"evasive, a liar and a fraud\".<ref>E. Huxley, p.&nbsp;35.</ref>\n\nHe was equally hostile to [[William Speirs Bruce]], the Scottish explorer who had written to Markham asking to join the National Antarctic Expedition. On receiving no confirmation of an appointment, Bruce obtained finance from the Scottish [[Coats baronets]] family and organised his own [[Scottish National Antarctic Expedition]]. Markham accused Bruce of \"mischievous rivalry\", and of attempting to \"cripple the National Expedition&nbsp;... in order to get up a scheme for yourself\".<ref>Speak, pp.&nbsp;71\u201375.</ref> The Scottish expedition duly sailed, but Markham remained unforgiving towards it, and used his influence to ensure that its participants received no Polar Medals on their return.<ref>Speak, pp.&nbsp;127\u2013131.</ref>\n\nA substantial private donation and a government grant finally allowed the National Antarctic Expedition to proceed. A new ship, the {{RRS|Discovery||2}}, was built, and a mainly naval crew of officers and crewmen appointed, along with a scientific staff which was later described as \"underpowered\".<ref>Crane, p.&nbsp;279.</ref> ''Discovery'' sailed on 5&nbsp;August 1901, after an inspection by King [[Edward VII]], at which Markham was present to introduce Scott and the officers. The ship was gone for just over three years during which time, from a base in the [[Ross Sea]] area, significant explorations of this sector of Antarctica were carried out, along with an extensive scientific programme.

Markham, pp.&nbsp;341\u2013345.</ref> He continued to produce papers for the RGS, and remained president of the [[Hakluyt Society]] until 1910.<ref name= Baigent/> Markham continued to travel extensively in Europe, and in 1906 cruised with the Mediterranean squadron, where Scott was acting as flag captain to Rear Admiral [[George Egerton (Royal Navy officer)|George Egerton]]. When, in 1909, Scott announced his plans for a new Antarctic venture, the [[Terra Nova Expedition|''Terra Nova'' expedition]], Markham assisted with fundraising and served on the expedition's organising committee, arranging the deal which brought in Lieutenant \"Teddy\" Evans as second-in-command, in return for the abandonment of Evans's own expedition plans.<ref>Crane, p.&nbsp;401.</ref>\n\nMarkham was awarded honorary degrees from the [[University of Cambridge]] and [[University of Leeds]]. In conferring this latter degree, the [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] referred to Markham as \"a veteran in the service of mankind\", and recalled that he had been \"for sixty years the inspiration of English geographical science.\"<ref>A. Markham, pp.&nbsp;344, 351\u2013352.</ref> However, Markham did not altogether avoid controversy. In 1912, when [[Roald Amundsen]], conqueror of the South Pole, was invited by RGS president Leonard Darwin to dine with the Society, Markham resigned his council seat in protest.<ref>Jones, p.&nbsp;92.</ref>\n\nThe news of the death of Scott and his returning polar party reached Markham in February 1913, while he was staying in [[Estoril]].<ref name= AHM356>A. Markham, pp.&nbsp;356\u2013360.</ref> He returned to England, and assisted with the preparation of Scott's journals for publication.<ref>Jones, p.&nbsp;122.</ref> Scott's death was a heavy blow, but Markham continued to lead a busy life of writing and travelling. In 1915, he was present at the service in St Peter's Church, [[Binton]], near [[Stratford-upon-Avon]], where a window was dedicated to Scott and his companions; later that year he assisted at the unveiling of the Royal Navy's statue of Scott, in Waterloo Place, London.<ref name= AHM356/> Markham read his last paper for the RGS on 10&nbsp;June 1915, its title being \"The History of the Gradual Development of the Groundwork of Geographical Science\".<ref name= AHM356/>\n\n== Death and legacy ==\n[[File:Sir Clements Robert Markham Bust.jpg|thumb|upright|Bust of Markham by [[F.&nbsp;W. Pomeroy]]]]\nOn 29 January 1916, while reading in bed by candlelight, Markham set fire to the bedclothes and was overcome by smoke. He died the following day.<ref name= Baigent/> His last diary entry, a few days earlier, had recorded a visit from Peter Markham Scott.<ref name= AMH361>A. Markham, pp.&nbsp;361\u2013365.</ref>\n\nThe family received tributes from King [[George V]], who acknowledged the debt the country owed to Markham's life work of study and research; from the Royal Geographical Society and the other learned bodies with which Markham had been associated; from the Naval Commander-in-Chief at Devonport; and from [[Fridtjof Nansen]], the Norwegian Arctic explorer. Other messages were received from France, Italy, Denmark, Sweden, the United States, and from Arequipa in Peru.<ref name= AMH361/>\n\nMore critical assessments of Markham's life and work were to follow. [[Hugh Robert Mill]], Shackleton's first biographer and for many years the RGS librarian, referred to the dictatorial manner in which Markham had run the Society.<ref name= Baigent/> In time, questions would be raised about the accuracy of some of his Hakluyt translations, and about the evidence of haste in the preparation of other publications.<ref name= Baigent/> On a personal level he had made enemies as well as friends; [[Frank Debenham]], the geologist who served with both Scott and Shackleton, called Markham \"a dangerous old man\",<ref>Riffenburgh, p.&nbsp;293.</ref> while William Speirs Bruce wrote of Markham's \"malicious opposition to the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition\".<ref name= Speak130>Speak, pp.&nbsp;130\u2013131.</ref>\n\nBruce's colleague [[Robert Rudmose-Brown]] went further, calling Markham \"that old fool and humbug\".<ref>Speak, p.&nbsp;123.</ref> These protestations reflected Markham's protective attitude towards Scott; according to Bruce, \"Scott was Markham's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, and Markham thought it necessary, in order to uphold Scott, that I should be obliterated\". He added that \"Scott and I were always good friends, in spite of Markham.\"<ref name= Speak130/> Markham's writings on naval history have been criticised by modern scholars due to his nationalistic exaggeration of English sailors' achievements in the [[Age of Discoveries]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Maura|first1=Juan Francisco|title=El mito de \"John Cabot\"construcci\u00f3n brit\u00e1nica para reclamar la soberan\u00eda de Norteam\u00e9rica|journal=Cuadernos Hispanoamericanos|date=2016|issue=788|pages=4\u201325|url=http://www.aecid.es/Centro-Documentacion/Documentos/Publicaciones%20AECID/WEB_CHA_788_2016.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIt has been suggested that Markham's prejudices about polar travel, particularly his belief in the \"nobility\" of [[manhauling]], had been passed to Scott, to the detriment of all future British expeditions.<ref>Jones, pp.&nbsp;58, 72.</ref> Mill's measured opinion, that Markham was \"an enthusiast rather than a scholar\", has been asserted as a fair summary of his strengths and weaknesses, and as the basis for his influence on the discipline of geography in the late-19th and early-20th centuries.<ref name= Baigent/> He is commemorated by [[Mount Markham]], {{coord|82|51|S|161|21|E|type:mountain}}, in the Transantarctic range, discovered and named by Scott on his southern march during the ''Discovery'' expedition in 1902.<ref>Crane, p.&nbsp;213.</ref>\n\nThe [[Markham River]] in Papua New Guinea was named after him;<ref>Souter, p.&nbsp;77.</ref> Carsten Borchgrevink discovered and named Markham Island in the Ross Sea during his 1900 expedition,<ref>{{cite web|title= Markham Island|url= http://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/gaz/display_name.cfm?gaz_id=128441|website = Australian Antarctic Division|accessdate= 27 April 2009}}</ref> a gesture that was not, however, acknowledged by Markham.<ref>E.

After his retirement from the India office in 1877, writing became his chief source of income. In addition to papers and reports for the Royal Geographical Society and other learned bodies, Markham wrote histories, biographies and travel accounts, many as full-length books.
