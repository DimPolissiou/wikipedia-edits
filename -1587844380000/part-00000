Current Indians broadcaster [[Rick Manning]] caught the 27th out of the night on a fly ball to center field.

[[Seattle Mariners]] [[third baseman]] [[Lenny Randle]] gets on his hands and knees and tries unsuccessfully to blow the ball [[foul ball|foul]].\n*May 29 - The Montreal Expos trade pitcher [[Jeff Reardon]] and outfielder Dan Norman to the Montreal Expos for outfielder [[Ellis Valentine]].\n\n===June\u2013July===\n*June 5 \u2013 [[Nolan Ryan]] issues the 1,777th [[walk (baseball)|walk]] in his career, breaking the record previously held by [[Early Wynn]].\n*June 7 - The Houston Astros trade pitcher [[Joaquin Andujar]] to the St. Louis Cardinals for outfielder Tony Scott.\n*June 8 \u2013 With their twelfth pick in the [[1981 Major League Baseball draft|June amateur draft]], the [[New York Mets]] select [[Roger Clemens]]. He declines to sign, deciding instead to attend the [[University of Texas at Austin]]. He is drafted by the [[Boston Red Sox]] in the first round (19th overall) of the [[1983 Major League Baseball draft]].\n** The [[Chicago Cubs]] select outfielder Joe Carter with their first round selection.\n*June 10 \u2013 [[Pete Rose]] hits a [[Nolan Ryan]] pitch in his first at-bat for the 3,630th safe hit of his career; tying [[Stan Musial]]'s [[National League]] record for career hits.  He would strike out in his next three at-bats in the game, however, in his bid to break the record.  \n*June 12 \u2013 After meeting with major league owners for most of the previous day, players' union chief [[Marvin Miller]] announces, \"We have accomplished nothing. The strike is on\", thus beginning the longest labor action to date in baseball history. By the time the season resumes on August 10, 706 games (38 percent of the season schedule) will have been canceled.\n*June 16 \u2013 In the midst of the players' strike, [[William Wrigley III]] announces the sale of the [[Chicago Cubs]] to the [[Tribune Company]] for $20 million.  This ends the decades-long association between the Wrigley family and the Cubs.\n*June 20 - [[Bernie Carbo]] signs a minor league with the Detroit Tigers. He plays in just 19 games for their Triple A team in Evansville. \n*June 23 \u2013 The [[Pawtucket Red Sox]] beat the [[Rochester Red Wings]], 3-2, in the 33rd inning of the [[longest professional baseball game|longest game in professional baseball history]].

The game ended 18 minutes after it resumed, with [[Dave Koza]] hitting an RBI-single that brought [[Marty Barrett (second baseman)|Marty Barrett]] with the winning run. Future [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famers]] [[Wade Boggs]] and [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]] participated for Pawtucket and Rochester, respectively.\n*July 11 - The Pittsburgh Pirates sign undrafted amateur free agent [[Bobby Bonilla]].\n\n===August\u2013September===\n*August 6 \u2013 As a result of the nearly two-month interruption in play because of the strike, major league owners elect to split the 1981 season into two halves, with the first-place teams from each half in each division (or a [[wild card (sports)|wild card]] team if the same club wins both halves) meeting in a best-of-five [[Division Series|divisional playoff series]]. The last time the major leagues played a split season was [[1892 in baseball|1892]]. The [[Oakland Athletics]], [[New York Yankees]], [[Philadelphia Phillies]] and [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] suddenly find themselves guaranteed playoff spots as first-half champions (a problem noted at this time is that those teams will not have much left to play for in the rest of that year's regular season).\n*August 9 \u2013 At [[Cleveland Stadium]], the [[National League]] wins its tenth consecutive [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] over the [[American League]], 5-4. [[Gary Carter]] hits two home runs and is selected the MVP. The 1981 Midsummer Classic becomes the second All-Star Game ever played during the month of August, the first having taken place on August 3, [[1959 in baseball|1959]].\n*August 10 \u2013 [[Pete Rose]] singles in the 8th inning off [[Mark Littell]] of the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] to break [[Stan Musial]]'s National League record for career hits.\n*August 24 \u2013 [[Kent Hrbek]] debuts as a [[Minnesota Twins|Minnesota Twin]].  His twelfth-inning home run beats the [[New York Yankees|Yankees]] 3-2 in New York. Hrbek will go on to have a 14-year career with his hometown team.\n** The Philadelphia Phillies release [[John Vukovich]], ending his major league career.\n*September 3 - The St. Louis Cardinals sell the contract of pitcher [[Donnie Moore]] to the Mailwaukee Brewers.\n*September 4 \u2013 In the conclusion of the longest game in [[Fenway Park]] history, the [[Seattle Mariners]] beat the [[Boston Red Sox]] 8\u20137 in 20 innings. The game began on September 3, but was suspended after 19 innings with the score tied 7-7.\n*September 6 \u2013 Despite having won the first-half American League East title, [[New York Yankees]] manager [[Gene Michael]] is replaced by [[Bob Lemon]], who managed the club in [[1978 in baseball|1978]]\u2013[[1979 in baseball|79]]. The Yankees are under .500 in the second half of the season.\n*September 6 \u2013 The [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]' [[Fernando Valenzuela]] beats the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] 5-0 to tie the National League record of seven shutouts by a rookie pitcher.\n*September 26 \u2013 [[Nolan Ryan]] of the [[Houston Astros]] breaks the record of four [[no hitter]]s by pitcher [[Sandy Koufax]] by pitching his fifth career no hitter in the [[Houston Astrodome|Astrodome]] against, coincidentally, Koufax's former team, the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]].\n*September 30 \u2013 The [[Kansas City Royals]] defeat the [[Minnesota Twins]], 5-2, in the last Major League game to be played at [[Metropolitan Stadium]], as the Twins prepare to move into the new [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]].  [[Clint Hurdle]] hits the last outdoor Major League home run in Minnesota until [[Target Field]] opens twenty-eight seasons later.\n\n===October\u2013December===\n*October 3 \u2013 [[Bob Horner]] hits two home runs and scores the winning run to give the [[Atlanta Braves]] a 4\u20133 win over the [[Cincinnati Reds]], and give the [[Houston Astros]] the second-half title in the NL West division. Cincinnati, which lost the first-half title to the [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Dodgers]] by one-half game, will finish with the best overall record (66-42) in the major leagues, but will miss the playoffs due to not winning either half's division title.\n*October 3 \u2013 The [[Milwaukee Brewers]] (playing since [[1970 in baseball|1970]]) and [[Montreal Expos]] (since [[1969 in baseball|1969]]) clinch their first postseason appearances. Milwaukee beats [[Detroit Tigers|Detroit]] 2\u20131 to wrap up the second-half title in the AL East division, while Montr\u00e9al edges the [[New York Mets|Mets]] 5\u20134 to win the NL East division's second playoff spot. (St. Louis finishes with the best overall record in the NL East but misses the playoffs for the same reason as the Cincinnati Reds.  St. Louis would make up for the heartbreak [[1982 St. Louis Cardinals season|the following season]]).\n*October 5 \u2013 The [[Kansas City Royals]] shut out [[Cleveland Indians|Cleveland]] 9\u20130 in the first game of a scheduled doubleheader to clinch the second-half title in the AL West division. The second game is canceled as irrelevant. This was a [[One-game playoff#Make-up games|make-up game]] after the scheduled season ended the day before.\n** [[Mark Fidrych]] is released by the [[Detroit Tigers]]. Fidrych had been an all-star and rookie of the year a few seasons prior, and became a pop culture figure in baseball. \n*October 19 \u2013 [[Rick Monday]] of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] hits a ninth inning [[home run]] to break a 1-1 tie, and secure a Game five victory in the [[1981 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]].  The losing [[Montr\u00e9al Expos]] had been leading the series 2 games-to-one in what would be their only post season appearance.\n*October 21 - The New York Yankees trade outfielder Willie McGee to the St. Louis Cardinals for pitcher [[Bob Sykes (baseball)|Bob Sykes]]. The trade would go on to be lopsided as McGee would become an all-star for the Cardinals, whereas Sykes would never pitcher a game on the major league level for the Yankees and would be out of organized baseball after the 1982 season. \n*October 26 - The Pittsburgh Pirates released [[Kurt Bevacqua]]. \n*October 28 \u2013 [[Pedro Guerrero (baseball)|Pedro Guerrero]] drives in five runs, and pitcher [[Burt Hooton]] and the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] beat the [[New York Yankees]], 9\u20132, to win the [[1981 World Series]] in six games. In a remarkable postseason, the Dodgers rallied from a 2-0 deficit against the Astros in the division series,  they rallied from a 2 games to 1 deficit against the Expos in the National League Championship series, and they rallied from a 2-0 deficit against the Yankees in the World Series. Guerrero, [[Ron Cey]] and [[Steve Yeager]] are named co-MVPs.\n*October 28- Pitcher [[George Frazier]] of the [[New York Yankees]] makes dubious history when he is credited with the loss in game six of the world Series, making him the first pitcher with three losses in a best of seven series since [[Lefty Williams]] of the [[Chicago White Sox]] in 1919.\n*November 4 The Cincinnari Reds trade outfielder [[Ken Griffey Sr.]] to the New York Yankees in exchange for minor leaguer Brian Ryder and a player to be named later. On December 9th, the Yankees sent pitcher Freddie Tolliver to the Reds to complete the trade.\n*November 11 \u2013 [[Fernando Valenzuela]] of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] wins the [[National League]] [[Cy Young Award]], becoming the first rookie to win the award.\n*November 20 \u2013 In a blockbuster three team trade, the [[Cleveland Indians]] send [[catcher]] [[Bo D\u00edaz]] to the [[Philadelphia Phillies]]; the Phillies sent [[Lonnie Smith]] to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]]; the Cardinals sent [[pitchers]] [[Silvio Martinez]] and [[Lary Sorensen]] to the Indians, and the Phillies sent a player to be named later to the Indians. The Phillies sent [[Scott Munninghoff]] to the Indians on December 9 to complete the trade.\n*November 25 \u2013 [[Rollie Fingers]] of the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] becomes the first relief pitcher ever to win the American League MVP Award, edging [[Rickey Henderson]] of the [[Oakland Athletics]], 319 to 308. Fingers saved 28 games while posting a significant 1.04 ERA.\n*December 2 \u2013 [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] pitcher [[Fernando Valenzuela]] became the third consecutive Dodgers player to be named National League Rookie of the Year. The Mexican left-hander posted a 13-7 record with a 2.48 ERA and led the NL in strikeouts (180), games started (25), complete games (11), shutouts (eight) and innings pitched (192{{fraction|1|3}}). His 13 wins tied him with [[Steve Carlton]] in second place behind [[Tom Seaver]], who finished with 14. Valenzuela also made his first All-Star appearance and received both the [[Cy Young Award]] and ''[[Sporting News|TSN]]'' Rookie of the Year.\n*December 6 - The Philadelphia Philles sell the contract of [[Bob Boone]] to the California Angels.\n*December 18 - The Cincinnati Reds trade [[Ray Knight]] to the Houston Astros in exchange for outfielder [[Cesar Cedeno]].\n\n==Movies==\n*''[[Don't Look Back: The Story of Leroy 'Satchel' Paige]]'' (TV)\n\n==Births==\n\n===January===\n*January 2 \u2013 [[Ryan Garko]]\n*January 4 \u2013 [[Jailen Peguero]]\n*January 5 \u2013 [[Andy Cavazos]]\n*January 8 \u2013 [[Daniel Davidson]]\n*January 8 \u2013 [[Jeff Francis]]\n*January 8 \u2013 [[Derek Thompson (baseball)|Derek Thompson]]\n*January 13 \u2013 [[Jos\u00e9 Capell\u00e1n]]\n*January 13 \u2013 [[Darrell Rasner]]\n*January 16 \u2013 [[Mitch Stetter]]\n*January 18 \u2013 [[Brandon Fahey]]\n*January 20 \u2013 [[John Baker (baseball)|John Baker]]\n*January 20 \u2013 [[Freddy Guzm\u00e1n]]\n*January 21 \u2013 [[Wilfredo Ledezma]]\n*January 25 \u2013 [[Andy Machado]]\n*January 26 \u2013 [[Juan Lara]]\n*January 26 \u2013 [[Josh Sharpless]]\n*January 28 \u2013 [[Doug Waechter]]\n\n===February===\n*February 4 \u2013 [[Ben Hendrickson]]\n*February 4 \u2013 [[Tom Mastny]]\n*February 7 \u2013 [[Seth McClung]]\n*February 12 \u2013 [[Chris Snyder]]\n*February 14 \u2013 [[Brad Halsey]]\n*February 16 \u2013 [[Sergio Mitre]]\n*February 16 \u2013 [[Jerry Owens]]\n*February 17 \u2013 [[Andrew Brown (pitcher)|Andrew Brown]]\n*February 18 \u2013 [[Alex R\u00edos]]\n*February 18 \u2013 [[Alex Serrano (baseball)|Alex Serrano]]\n*February 21 \u2013 [[Adam Greenberg (baseball)|Adam Greenberg]]\n*February 21 \u2013 [[Tsuyoshi Wada]]\n*February 24 \u2013 [[Rob Bowen]]\n*February 24 \u2013 [[Paul McAnulty]]\n*February 28 \u2013 [[Brian Bannister]]\n\n===March===\n*March 5 \u2013 [[Francisley Bueno]]\n*March 9 \u2013 [[Clay Rapada]]\n*March 12 \u2013 [[Carlos Mu\u00f1iz]]\n*March 13 \u2013 [[Mike Avil\u00e9s]]\n*March 14 \u2013 [[Bobby Jenks]]\n*March 16 \u2013 [[Curtis Granderson]]\n*March 18 \u2013 [[Darren Clarke (baseball)|Darren Clarke]]\n*March 19 \u2013 [[Jos\u00e9 Castillo (infielder)|Jos\u00e9 Castillo]]\n*March 23 \u2013 [[Anderson Garc\u00eda]]\n*March 23 \u2013 [[Tony Pe\u00f1a, Jr.|Tony Pe\u00f1a]]\n*March 24 \u2013 [[Dirk Hayhurst]]\n*March 26 \u2013 [[Josh Wilson (baseball)|Josh Wilson]]\n*March 27 \u2013 [[Brian Slocum]]\n*March 28 \u2013 [[Edwar Ram\u00edrez]]\n\n===April===\n*April 2 \u2013 [[Brian Barden]]\n*April 2 \u2013 [[Mike McCoy (baseball)|Mike McCoy]]\n*April 3 \u2013 [[Ryan Doumit]]\n*April 4 \u2013 [[Casey Daigle]]\n*April 5 \u2013 [[Jorge de la Rosa]]\n*April 8 \u2013 [[Brian Burres]]\n*April 8 \u2013 [[Matt Ford]]\n*April 9 \u2013 [[A.

He is also [[batting average (baseball)|batting]] over .400 to help his own cause.\n*April 29 \u2013 [[Steve Carlton]] of the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] records his 3000th career strikeout. April 1981 is the only month in history to have two pitchers reach this milestone.

Current Indians broadcaster [[Rick Manning]] caught the 27th out of the night on a fly ball to center field.  Barker's catcher, [[Ron Hassey]] will later catch [[Dennis Mart\u00ednez]]'s [[1991 in baseball|1991]] perfect game making him the first catcher in history to catch two perfect games.\n*May 21 \u2013 [[Ron Darling]] of [[Yale University]] pitches a [[no-hitter]] through eleven innings against [[St. John's University (New York City)|St. John's University]].

He would strike out in his next three at-bats in the game, however, in his bid to break the record.  \n*June 12 \u2013 After meeting with major league owners for most of the previous day, players' union chief [[Marvin Miller]] announces, \"We have accomplished nothing. The strike is on\", thus beginning the longest labor action to date in baseball history. By the time the season resumes on August 10, 706 games (38 percent of the season schedule) will have been canceled.\n*June 16 \u2013 In the midst of the players' strike, [[William Wrigley III]] announces the sale of the [[Chicago Cubs]] to the [[Tribune Company]] for $20 million.

Future [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famers]] [[Wade Boggs]] and [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]] participated for Pawtucket and Rochester, respectively.\n*July 11 - The Pittsburgh Pirates sign undrafted amateur free agent [[Bobby Bonilla]].\n\n===August\u2013September===\n*August 6 \u2013 As a result of the nearly two-month interruption in play because of the strike, major league owners elect to split the 1981 season into two halves, with the first-place teams from each half in each division (or a [[wild card (sports)|wild card]] team if the same club wins both halves) meeting in a best-of-five [[Division Series|divisional playoff series]]. The last time the major leagues played a split season was [[1892 in baseball|1892]]. The [[Oakland Athletics]], [[New York Yankees]], [[Philadelphia Phillies]] and [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] suddenly find themselves guaranteed playoff spots as first-half champions (a problem noted at this time is that those teams will not have much left to play for in the rest of that year's regular season).\n*August 9 \u2013 At [[Cleveland Stadium]], the [[National League]] wins its tenth consecutive [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] over the [[American League]], 5-4.

The game began on September 3, but was suspended after 19 innings with the score tied 7-7.\n*September 6 \u2013 Despite having won the first-half American League East title, [[New York Yankees]] manager [[Gene Michael]] is replaced by [[Bob Lemon]], who managed the club in [[1978 in baseball|1978]]\u2013[[1979 in baseball|79]]. The Yankees are under .500 in the second half of the season.\n*September 6 \u2013 The [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]' [[Fernando Valenzuela]] beats the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] 5-0 to tie the National League record of seven shutouts by a rookie pitcher.\n*September 26 \u2013 [[Nolan Ryan]] of the [[Houston Astros]] breaks the record of four [[no hitter]]s by pitcher [[Sandy Koufax]] by pitching his fifth career no hitter in the [[Houston Astrodome|Astrodome]] against, coincidentally, Koufax's former team, the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]].\n*September 30 \u2013 The [[Kansas City Royals]] defeat the [[Minnesota Twins]], 5-2, in the last Major League game to be played at [[Metropolitan Stadium]], as the Twins prepare to move into the new [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]].  [[Clint Hurdle]] hits the last outdoor Major League home run in Minnesota until [[Target Field]] opens twenty-eight seasons later.\n\n===October\u2013December===\n*October 3 \u2013 [[Bob Horner]] hits two home runs and scores the winning run to give the [[Atlanta Braves]] a 4\u20133 win over the [[Cincinnati Reds]], and give the [[Houston Astros]] the second-half title in the NL West division. Cincinnati, which lost the first-half title to the [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Dodgers]] by one-half game, will finish with the best overall record (66-42) in the major leagues, but will miss the playoffs due to not winning either half's division title.\n*October 3 \u2013 The [[Milwaukee Brewers]] (playing since [[1970 in baseball|1970]]) and [[Montreal Expos]] (since [[1969 in baseball|1969]]) clinch their first postseason appearances. Milwaukee beats [[Detroit Tigers|Detroit]] 2\u20131 to wrap up the second-half title in the AL East division, while Montr\u00e9al edges the [[New York Mets|Mets]] 5\u20134 to win the NL East division's second playoff spot. (St. Louis finishes with the best overall record in the NL East but misses the playoffs for the same reason as the Cincinnati Reds.  St. Louis would make up for the heartbreak [[1982 St. Louis Cardinals season|the following season]]).\n*October 5 \u2013 The [[Kansas City Royals]] shut out [[Cleveland Indians|Cleveland]] 9\u20130 in the first game of a scheduled doubleheader to clinch the second-half title in the AL West division. The second game is canceled as irrelevant. This was a [[One-game playoff#Make-up games|make-up game]] after the scheduled season ended the day before.\n** [[Mark Fidrych]] is released by the [[Detroit Tigers]]. Fidrych had been an all-star and rookie of the year a few seasons prior, and became a pop culture figure in baseball. \n*October 19 \u2013 [[Rick Monday]] of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] hits a ninth inning [[home run]] to break a 1-1 tie, and secure a Game five victory in the [[1981 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]].  The losing [[Montr\u00e9al Expos]] had been leading the series 2 games-to-one in what would be their only post season appearance.\n*October 21 - The New York Yankees trade outfielder Willie McGee to the St. Louis Cardinals for pitcher [[Bob Sykes (baseball)|Bob Sykes]]. The trade would go on to be lopsided as McGee would become an all-star for the Cardinals, whereas Sykes would never pitcher a game on the major league level for the Yankees and would be out of organized baseball after the 1982 season. \n*October 26 - The Pittsburgh Pirates released [[Kurt Bevacqua]]. \n*October 28 \u2013 [[Pedro Guerrero (baseball)|Pedro Guerrero]] drives in five runs, and pitcher [[Burt Hooton]] and the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] beat the [[New York Yankees]], 9\u20132, to win the [[1981 World Series]] in six games. In a remarkable postseason, the Dodgers rallied from a 2-0 deficit against the Astros in the division series,  they rallied from a 2 games to 1 deficit against the Expos in the National League Championship series, and they rallied from a 2-0 deficit against the Yankees in the World Series. Guerrero, [[Ron Cey]] and [[Steve Yeager]] are named co-MVPs.\n*October 28- Pitcher [[George Frazier]] of the [[New York Yankees]] makes dubious history when he is credited with the loss in game six of the world Series, making him the first pitcher with three losses in a best of seven series since [[Lefty Williams]] of the [[Chicago White Sox]] in 1919.\n*November 4 The Cincinnari Reds trade outfielder [[Ken Griffey Sr.]] to the New York Yankees in exchange for minor leaguer Brian Ryder and a player to be named later. On December 9th, the Yankees sent pitcher Freddie Tolliver to the Reds to complete the trade.\n*November 11 \u2013 [[Fernando Valenzuela]] of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] wins the [[National League]] [[Cy Young Award]], becoming the first rookie to win the award.\n*November 20 \u2013 In a blockbuster three team trade, the [[Cleveland Indians]] send [[catcher]] [[Bo D\u00edaz]] to the [[Philadelphia Phillies]]; the Phillies sent [[Lonnie Smith]] to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]]; the Cardinals sent [[pitchers]] [[Silvio Martinez]] and [[Lary Sorensen]] to the Indians, and the Phillies sent a player to be named later to the Indians. The Phillies sent [[Scott Munninghoff]] to the Indians on December 9 to complete the trade.\n*November 25 \u2013 [[Rollie Fingers]] of the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] becomes the first relief pitcher ever to win the American League MVP Award, edging [[Rickey Henderson]] of the [[Oakland Athletics]], 319 to 308. Fingers saved 28 games while posting a significant 1.04 ERA.\n*December 2 \u2013 [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] pitcher [[Fernando Valenzuela]] became the third consecutive Dodgers player to be named National League Rookie of the Year. The Mexican left-hander posted a 13-7 record with a 2.48 ERA and led the NL in strikeouts (180), games started (25), complete games (11), shutouts (eight) and innings pitched (192{{fraction|1|3}}). His 13 wins tied him with [[Steve Carlton]] in second place behind [[Tom Seaver]], who finished with 14.

The ordinance also officially suspends the charging late fees for water and sewer, stopping the disconnection of water and sewer service for non-payment, extension of the payment deadline of the city's food and beverage tax along with the package liquor tax until May 20, extends the motor fuel taxes and hotel/motel taxes until April 30.

A DC voltage can be used to control a UJT or PUT circuit such that the \"on-period\" increases with an increase in the DC control voltage. This application is important for large AC current control.\n\nUJTs can also be used to measure magnetic flux. The [[hall effect]] modulates the voltage at the PN junction. This affects the frequency of UJT relaxation oscillators.<ref>{{cite journal\n|last1=Agrawal\n|first1=S. L.\n|last2=Saha\n|first2=D. P.\n|last3=Swami\n|first3=R.\n|last4=Singh\n|first4=R.

The base is formed by a lightly [[Doping (semiconductor)|doped]] [[N-type semiconductor|n-type]] bar of silicon. Two ohmic contacts B<sub>1</sub> and B<sub>2</sub> are attached at its ends. The emitter is of [[P-type semiconductor|p-type]] is heavily doped; this single PN junction gives the device its name. The resistance between B1 and B2 when the emitter is open-circuit is called ''interbase resistance''. The emitter junction is usually located closer to base-2 (B2) than base-1 (B1) so that the device is not symmetrical, because a symmetrical unit does not provide optimum electrical characteristics for most of the applications.\n\nIf no potential difference exists between its emitter and either of its base leads, there is an extremely small [[Electric current|current]] from B<sub>1</sub> to B<sub>2</sub>. On the other hand, if an adequately large voltage relative to its base leads, known as the ''trigger voltage'', is applied to its emitter, then a very large current from its emitter joins the current from B<sub>1</sub> to B<sub>2</sub>, which creates a larger B<sub>2</sub> output current.\n\nThe [[schematic diagram]] symbol for a unijunction transistor represents the emitter lead with an arrow, showing the direction of [[conventional current]] when the emitter-base junction is conducting a current. A complementary UJT uses a p-type base and an n-type emitter, and operates the same as the n-type base device but with all voltage polarities reversed.\n\nThe structure of a UJT is similar to that of an N-channel [[JFET]], but p-type (gate) material surrounds the N-type (channel) material in a JFET, and the gate surface is larger than the emitter junction of UJT. A UJT is operated with the emitter junction forward-biased while the JFET is normally operated with the gate junction reverse-biased. It is a current-controlled [[negative resistance]] device.\n\n==Device operation==\nThe device has a unique characteristic that when it is triggered, its emitter current increases regeneratively until it is restricted by emitter power supply. It exhibits a negative resistance characteristic and so it can be employed as an oscillator.\n\nThe UJT is biased with a positive voltage between the two bases. This causes a potential drop along the length of the device. When the emitter voltage is driven approximately one diode voltage above the voltage at the point where the P diffusion (emitter) is, current will begin to flow from the emitter into the base region. Because the base region is very lightly doped, the additional current (actually charges in the base region) causes [[conductivity modulation]] which reduces the resistance of the portion of the base between the emitter junction and the B2 terminal. This reduction in resistance means that the emitter junction is more forward biased, and so even more current is injected. Overall, the effect is a negative resistance at the emitter terminal. This is what makes the UJT useful, especially in simple oscillator circuits.\n\n==Invention==\nThe unijunction transistor was invented as a byproduct of research on [[germanium]] tetrode transistors at [[General Electric]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.semiconductormuseum.com/Transistors/GE/OralHistories/Suran/Suran_Index.htm|title=Transistor Museum Oral History Suran Index GE Unijunction Transistors|author=Jack Ward|date=2005|work=SemiconductorMuseum.com|access-date=April 10, 2017}}</ref> It was patented in 1953.
