The intermediate compound [[\u03b3-hydroxybutyraldehyde]] (GHBAL) is also a prodrug for GHB; however, as with all [[aliphatic]] aldehydes this compound is caustic and is strong-smelling and foul-tasting; actual use of this compound as an intoxicant is likely to be unpleasant and result in severe nausea and vomiting.\n\n[[File:GHB metabolic pathway.svg|thumb|center|600px|Metabolic pathway of GHB.<!-- This image incorrectly labels the enzyme responsible for GBL breakdown as lactamase.

Under normal physiological conditions, the concentration of GHB in the body is rather low, and the pathways would run in the reverse direction to what is shown here to produce endogenous GHB. However, when GHB is consumed for [[recreational drug use|recreational]] or health promotion purposes, its concentration in the body is much higher than normal, which changes the enzyme kinetics so that these pathways operate to metabolise GHB rather than producing it.\n\n==History==\n[[Alexander Mikhaylovich Zaytsev|Alexander Zaytsev]] worked on this chemical family and published work on it in 1874.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=David E.|title=Early Russian organic chemists and their legacy|date=2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783642282195|chapter=Section 4.4.3 Aleksandr Mikhailovich Zaitsev}}</ref>{{rp|79}}<ref>{{Cite journal| year = 1874 | title = \u00dcber die Reduction des Succinylchlorids | journal = [[Liebigs Annalen der Chemie]] | volume = 171 | pages = 258\u2013290 | language = German | doi = 10.1002/jlac.18741710216| issue = 2| last1 = Saytzeff| first1 = Alexander| url = https://zenodo.org/record/1427333 }}</ref> The first extended research into GHB and its use in humans was conducted in the early 1960s by Dr. [[Henri Laborit]] to use in studying the neurotransmitter GABA.<ref name=\"WHO\">{{cite web|title=Critical review of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB)|url=http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/quality_safety/4.1GHBcritical_review.pdf|date=2012}}</ref>{{rp|11\u201312}}<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Laborit H, Jouany JM, Gerard J, Fabiani F | title = [Generalities concerning the experimental study and clinical use of gamma hydroxybutyrate of Na] | language = French | journal = Agressologie | volume = 1 | pages = 397\u2013406 | date = October 1960 | pmid = 13758011 }}</ref>  It was studied in a range of uses including obstetric surgery and during childbirth and as an anxiolytic; there were anecdotal reports of it having antidepressant and aphrodisiac effects as well.<ref name=WHO/>{{rp|27}}  It was also studied as an intravenous [[anesthetic]] agent and was marketed for that purpose starting in 1964 in Europe but it was not widely adopted as it caused seizures; as of 2006 that use was still authorized in France and Italy but not widely used.<ref name=WHO/>{{rp|27\u201328}}  It was also studied to treat alcohol addiction; while the evidence for this use is weak,<ref name=WHO/>{{rp|28\u201329}} however sodium oxybate is marketed for this use in Italy.<ref name=\"AlcoverLabel\">{{cite web|title=Alcover: Riassunto delle Caratteristiche del Prodotto|url=https://farmaci.agenziafarmaco.gov.it/aifa/servlet/PdfDownloadServlet?pdfFileName=footer_000223_027751_RCP.pdf&retry=0&sys=m0b1l3|date=31 March 2017|publisher=Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco}} [https://farmaci.agenziafarmaco.gov.it/bancadatifarmaci/farmaco?farmaco=027751 Index page]</ref>\n\nGHB and sodium oxybate were also studied for use in [[narcolepsy]] from the 1960s onwards.<ref name=WHO/>{{rp|28}}\n\nIn May 1990 GHB was introduced as a [[dietary supplement]] and was marketed to body builders, for help with weight control and as a sleep aid, and as a \"replacement\" for [[l-tryptophan]], which was removed from the market in November 1989 when batches contaminated with trace impurities <ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ito J, Hosaki Y, Torigoe Y, Sakimoto K | title = Identification of substances formed by decomposition of peak E substance in tryptophan | journal = Food and Chemical Toxicology | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 71\u201381 | date = January 1992 | pmid = 1544609 | doi = 10.1016/0278-6915(92)90139-C }}</ref> were found to cause [[eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome]], although eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome is also tied to tryptophan overload.<ref name=\"pmid16307217\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith MJ, Garrett RH | title = A heretofore undisclosed crux of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome: compromised histamine degradation | journal = Inflammation Research | volume = 54 | issue = 11 | pages = 435\u201350 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16307217 | doi = 10.1007/s00011-005-1380-7 }}</ref> In 2001 tryptophan supplement sales were allowed to resume, and in 2005 the FDA ban on tryptophan supplement importation was lifted.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kapalka |first1=George M. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Nutritional and herbal therapies for children and adolescents : a handbook for mental health clinicians |date=2010 |publisher=Elsevier/AP |isbn=978-0-12-374927-7}}</ref> By November 1989 57 cases of illness caused by the GHB supplements had been reported to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], with people having taken up to three teaspoons of GHB; there were no deaths but nine people needed care in an [[intensive care unit]].<ref name=\"MMWR\">{{cite journal | title = Multistate outbreak of poisonings associated with illicit use of gamma hydroxy butyrate | journal = MMWR.

Possession of the substance for consumption without license from the Department of Health is illegal with a HK$100,000 fine or five years of jail time.\n\nIn Canada, GHB has been a Schedule I controlled substance since 6 November 2012 (the same schedule that contains heroin and cocaine).  Prior to that date, it was a Schedule III controlled substance (the same schedule that contains amphetamines and LSD).<ref>{{cite web |title=Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, SC 1996, c 19 |url=https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/sc-1996-c-19/latest/sc-1996-c-19.html#history |website=Canadian Legal Information Institute |publisher=Canadian Legal Information Institute |access-date=25 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn New Zealand and Australia, GHB, 1,4-B, and GBL are all Class B illegal drugs, along with any possible esters, ethers, and aldehydes. GABA itself is also listed as an illegal drug in these jurisdictions, which seems unusual given its failure to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier, but there was a perception among legislators that all known analogues should be covered as far as this was possible. Attempts to circumvent the illegal status of GHB have led to the sale of derivatives such as 4-methyl-GHB (\u03b3-hydroxyvaleric acid, GHV) and its prodrug form \u03b3-valerolactone (GVL), but these are also covered under the law by virtue of their being \"substantially similar\" to GHB or GBL and; so importation, sale, possession and use of these compounds is also considered to be illegal.\n\nIn Chile, GHB is a controlled drug under the law {{lang|es|Ley de substancias psicotr\u00f3picas y estupefacientes}} (psychotropic substances and narcotics).\n\nIn Norway<ref name=\"urlFOR 30 June 1978 nr 08: Forskrift om narkotika m.v.
