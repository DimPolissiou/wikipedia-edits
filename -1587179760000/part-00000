This caused the [[Travel Channel]] to dedicate part of their show [[World Travels]] to the hotel. This feature on the hotel was premiered on Monday, January 19, 2004. Whether the ghost sighting  theory is a promotional stunt or not is debatable.\n\n== Historical facts ==\n\nThe site where the hotel sits was the location of the first school in Phoenix. The  four room adobe school was inaugurated in 1874. It was replaced with a larger structure in 1879. The school was enlarged several times but was condemned in 1916, with construction of a luxury hotel in mind. In addition, many area children died during the 1918 [[Spanish flu]] epidemic that attacked the [[United States]].\n\nIn 1919, the land was bought by the Babbitt family (relatives of [[Bruce Babbitt]], former Secretary of the Interior and Arizona Governor, who intended to build a hotel. The San Carlos Hotel project was finally begun by Charles Harris and [[Dwight D. Heard]] who purchased the property from the Babbitts. Construction began in 1927. The hotel was designed by Nationally known architects in the Italian Renaissance style. The hotel was state of the art with air conditioning (the first in Phoenix), elevators, circulating chilled water in the rooms and steam heat. The hotel grand opening was on March 19, 1928. The hotel was built at a cost of nearly $850,000. Mr. Charles Harris was the co-owner and managing partner of the San Carlos. When Mr. Dwight Heard died in 1929 Mr. Harris took over full-time management of the San Carlos. He moved his family into the roof top bungalow or penthouse and worked diligently to keep the San Carlos Hotel open during the Great Depression. The hotel remained in the Harris Family until 1967 when Mr. Harris' widow, Elsie, sold the hotel to an investment group. The investment group was unsuccessful and in 1970 sold the San carlos to Mr. Gregory Melikian.  Over the past 43 years Mr. Gregory Melikian and his family have owned, operated and lovingly restored the San Carlos Hotel to its original splendor.  The Melikian Family are instrumental in saving many historic properties in Phoenix.\n\nThe hotel competed with the posh, nearby [[Westward Ho (Phoenix)|Westward Ho]] hotel, completed the following year, which was located on what once was Phoenix's first radio transmitter and whose list of clientele include such celebrities as [[Jack Dempsey]] and [[John F. Kennedy]]. The San Carlos had its share of celebrities such as [[Mae West]], [[Clark Gable]], [[Carole Lombard]], [[Marilyn Monroe]] and [[Gene Autry]].\n\nOn May 7, 1928, ''[[The Arizona Republic]]'' reported the death of Leone Jensen. The article's headline read \"Pretty blonde jumps from (the) San Carlos (hotel) early today\". Based on what she wrote on her death note, it could be assumed that the 22-year-old woman was physically abused by her boyfriend, a bellboy at the Westward Ho. Speculations have been made as to whether Jensen was pregnant and/or her boyfriend was having an affair with another hotel worker. Because of these theories, the way she died is also debated. While most evidence pointed to suicide, many have said that she could have been pushed off by her boyfriend or her boyfriend's other girlfriend.\n\nAnother ghost frequently mentioned by hotel employees is that of a little girl, possibly around six to nine years old, who is rumored to visit hotel rooms at night and sit crying. Ghost believers think she was probably one of the area children affected either by the school's closing or the flu epidemic.\n\nOn December 9, 2004, yet another death happened at this hotel, when an unidentified man jumped to his death from the hotel's roof.\n\nThe Hotel San Carlos in Phoenix, a member of [[Historic Hotels of America]], a program of the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]], underwent a $1,000,000 remodel in 2003. Work continues on this historic boutique hotel. The hotel faces stiff competition from such five-star hotels as [[The Phoenician]], [[Arizona Biltmore Hotel]] the [[Ritz Carlton]], many [[Hilton Hotels]] and the [[Hyatt Regency Phoenix]]. However, as downtown Phoenix continues its dramatic growth the Hotel San Carlos remains in the heart of downtown Phoenix, 6 blocks from [[Chase Field]] home of the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]], 5 blocks from [[Talking Stick Resort Arena]], home of the [[Phoenix Suns]], and less than 3 blocks from the [[Dodge Theatre]], [[Symphony Hall Phoenix]], [[Orpheum Theatre (Phoenix)|Orpheum Theatre]], the [[Phoenix Convention Center]] and the [[Herberger Performing Arts Center]].\n\nThe hotel can be briefly seen in the opening shot of [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s 1960 film ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', as the camera pans the then-skyline of downtown Phoenix.\n\n==See also==\n*[[National Register of Historic Places listings in Yuma County, Arizona]] \u2014 for the San Carlos Hotel in Yuma, also on the NRHP in Arizona\n*[[List of historic properties in Phoenix]]\n*[[Phoenix Historic Property Register]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Hotel San Carlos (Phoenix)}}\n*[http://www.hotelsancarlos.com/ Official Hotel San Carlos website]\n\n{{National Register of Historic Places}}\n\n[[Category:Hotels in Arizona]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Phoenix, Arizona]]\n[[Category:Hotel buildings completed in 1928]]\n[[Category:1928 establishments in Arizona]]\n[[Category:Hotel buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Arizona]]\n[[Category:National Register of Historic Places in Phoenix, Arizona]]\n[[Category:Renaissance Revival architecture in Arizona]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|April 2009|date=April 2009}}\n{{Infobox hotel\n| hotel_name = Hotel San Carlos\n| image              = Maruqee shot of Hotel San Carlos in Phoenix, Ariz..jpg\n| image_width        = \n| caption            = The Hotel San Carlos [[Marquee (sign)|Marquee]] as seen from [[Central Avenue Corridor|Central Avenue]]\n| location           = 202 N Central Ave., [[Phoenix, Arizona]], [[United States of America|USA]], 85004\n| coordinates        =\n| opening_date       = March 19, 1928\n| stars              = \n| diamonds           = \n| closing_date       =\n| architect = \n| developer          = \n| operator           =\n| owner              = \n| number_of_restaurants =\n| number_of_rooms    = \n| number_of_suites   =\n| floor_area         = \n| floors             = \n| parking            =\n| website            =[http://www.hotelsancarlos.com/ hotelsancarlos.com]  \n| footnotes          =\n}}\n\n{{Infobox NRHP\n  | name = Hotel San Carlos\n  | nrhp_type = \n  | image = Hotel San Carlos - South East Corner - 2009-12-08.JPG\n  | caption = the Hotel San Carlos in Downtown Phoenix\n  | location= 202 North Central Avenue<br>[[Phoenix, Arizona]] 85004\n  | coordinates = {{Coord|33|27|2|N|112|4|27|W|type:landmark_region:US-AZ|display=inline,title}}\n  | locmapin = Arizona#USA\n  | built = 1928\n  | architect = Richie, George Whitecross; Kinnie & Westerhouse\n  | architecture = Renaissance\n  | added = December 8, 1983\n  | area = less than one acre\n  | governing_body = Private\n  | mpsub = Phoenix Commercial MRA (AD)\n  | refnum = 83003498<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|2009a}}</ref>\n}}\nThe '''Hotel San Carlos''' branch in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], also known as '''San Carlos Hotel''', is both an operating hotel and tourist site.

A special hosted by [[Joel McHale]] was released on April 12, 2020, with McHale interviewing several of the stars about Exotic and the series itself.\n\nThe series received acclaim from critics, and according to [[Nielsen ratings]], was watched by 34.3 million people over its first ten days of release, ranking as one of Netflix's most successful releases to date.\n\n==Summary==\n{{more sources|date=April 2020|section}}The series explores the little-known, deeply interconnected society of [[big cat]] conservationists and collectors in America, and the private [[zoo]]s and sanctuaries they have set up for these unusual and deadly animals. The primary subject is [[Joe Exotic]], the eccentric owner of the [[Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park|G.W. Zoo]] in [[Wynnewood, Oklahoma]], and his bitter years-long feud with [[Carole Baskin]], CEO of [[Big Cat Rescue]] in [[Tampa, Florida]]. Baskin presents herself as an [[animal rights]] activist whose mission is to provide a [[Animal sanctuary|sanctuary]] for big cats raised in captivity, but Joe Exotic maintains that she is simply a rival zookeeper whose aim is to eliminate her competition. The two exchange threatening videos, legal allegations, protests, and targeted harassment campaigns, in which [[PETA]] and the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] become involved. Joe Exotic goes so far as to allege that Baskin  [[Disappearance of Don Lewis|murdered her second husband Don Lewis]], who has been [[Missing person|missing]] since 1997.\n\nJoe Exotic's personal life becomes a subject of interest, particularly his unofficial [[Polygamy|three-way]] [[same-sex marriage]] to Travis Maldonado and John Finlay and his subsequent relationships with them and future husband Dillon Passage. His 2016 run for [[President of the United States]] and [[2018 Oklahoma gubernatorial election#Libertarian_primary|2018 run for Governor of Oklahoma]] are documented with the assistance of his campaign manager, Joshua Dial. Producer [[TV_Junkie#Rick_Kirkham|Rick Kirkham]] recounts the rise and fall of \"Joe Exotic TV\", a sort of [[podcast]] that Kirkham was hoping to develop into a TV series until his footage is mysteriously destroyed. The series then records the events leading up to Joe Exotic's conviction under federal [[Contract killing|murder-for-hire]] statutes when it comes to light that he paid a hitman to murder Baskin; his conviction also includes violations of the [[Lacey Act]] and [[Endangered Species Act]], and results in a 22-year federal prison sentence.\n\nOther characters from the exotic animal community are introduced, including [[Bhagavan Antle]], an animal breeder accused of leading a personality cult; Mario Tabraue, a former drug lord who is involved in animal trafficking; Jeff Lowe, a [[Las Vegas]] playboy to whom Joe Exotic turns over his zoo for legal reasons; and James Garretson, who became a confidential [[informant]] for the federal government and a key figure in making the case against Joe Exotic. Former G.W. Zoo employees such as manager John Reinke and animal wrangler Saff Saffery conclude the series by commenting that the animals themselves were forgotten amongst all the interpersonal fighting, and that no party has truly come out victorious.<ref name=\"NYPN\">{{cite news |last1=Kaplan |first1=Michael |title=Everything you need to know about Netflix's new Joe Exotic doc, 'Tiger King' |url=https://nypost.com/2020/03/19/everything-you-need-to-know-about-netflixs-new-joe-exotic-doc-tiger-king/ |accessdate=March 20, 2020 |work=[[New York Post]] |issue=March 19, 2020 |publisher=NYP Holdings, Inc |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200320183106/https://nypost.com/2020/03/19/everything-you-need-to-know-about-netflixs-new-joe-exotic-doc-tiger-king/ |archive-date=March 20, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table |background=#B60006 |overall= |title= |director= |airdate= |country=U.S. |released=y |episodes= \n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 1\n |Title = Not Your Average Joe\n |DirectedBy = [[Eric Goode]] & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 2\n |Title = Cult of Personality\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 3\n |Title = The Secret\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 4\n |Title = Playing with Fire\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 5\n |Title = Make America Exotic Again\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 6\n |Title = The Noble Thing to Do\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 7\n |Title = Dethroned\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n}}\n\n===Special===\n{{Episode table |background=#B60006 |overall= |title= |airdate= |country=U.S. |released=y |episodes= \n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 8\n |Title = The Tiger King and I\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|12}}\n |ShortSummary = Special after-show hosted by [[Joel McHale]] \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nOn review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the series holds an approval rating of 89% based on 75 reviews, with an average rating of 7.88/10.

such as Exotic, whom Baskin accuses of abusing and exploiting wild animals. A special hosted by [[Joel McHale]] was released on April 12, 2020, with McHale interviewing several of the stars about Exotic and the series itself.\n\nThe series received acclaim from critics, and according to [[Nielsen ratings]], was watched by 34.3 million people over its first ten days of release, ranking as one of Netflix's most successful releases to date.\n\n==Summary==\n{{more sources|date=April 2020|section}}The series explores the little-known, deeply interconnected society of [[big cat]] conservationists and collectors in America, and the private [[zoo]]s and sanctuaries they have set up for these unusual and deadly animals. The primary subject is [[Joe Exotic]], the eccentric owner of the [[Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park|G.W. Zoo]] in [[Wynnewood, Oklahoma]], and his years-long bitter feud with [[Carole Baskin]], CEO of [[Big Cat Rescue]] in [[Tampa, Florida]]. Baskin presents herself as an [[animal rights]] activist whose mission is to provide a [[Animal sanctuary|sanctuary]] for big cats raised in captivity, but Joe Exotic maintains that she is simply a rival zookeeper whose aim is to eliminate her competition. The two exchange threatening videos, legal allegations, protests, and targeted harassment campaigns, in which [[PETA]] and the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] become involved. Joe Exotic goes so far as to allege that Baskin  [[Disappearance of Don Lewis|murdered her second husband Don Lewis]], who has been [[Missing person|missing]] since 1997.\n\nJoe Exotic's personal life becomes a subject of interest, particularly his unofficial [[Polygamy|three-way]] [[same-sex marriage]] to Travis Maldonado and John Finlay and his subsequent relationships with them and future husband Dillon Passage. His 2016 run for [[President of the United States]] and [[2018 Oklahoma gubernatorial election#Libertarian_primary|2018 run for Governor of Oklahoma]] are documented with the assistance of his campaign manager, Joshua Dial. Producer [[TV_Junkie#Rick_Kirkham|Rick Kirkham]] recounts the rise and fall of \"Joe Exotic TV\", a sort of [[podcast]] that Kirkham was hoping to develop into a TV series until his footage is mysteriously destroyed. The series then records the events leading up to Joe Exotic's conviction under federal [[Contract killing|murder-for-hire]] statutes when it comes to light that he paid a hitman to murder Baskin; his conviction also includes violations of the [[Lacey Act]] and [[Endangered Species Act]], and results in a 22-year federal prison sentence.\n\nOther characters from the exotic animal community are introduced, including [[Bhagavan Antle]], an animal breeder accused of leading a personality cult; Mario Tabraue, a former drug lord who is involved in animal trafficking; Jeff Lowe, a [[Las Vegas]] playboy to whom Joe Exotic turns over his zoo for legal reasons; and James Garretson, who became a confidential [[informant]] for the federal government and a key figure in making the case against Joe Exotic. Former G.W. Zoo employees such as manager John Reinke and animal wrangler Saff Saffery conclude the series by commenting that the animals themselves were forgotten amongst all the interpersonal fighting, and that no party has truly come out victorious.<ref name=\"NYPN\">{{cite news |last1=Kaplan |first1=Michael |title=Everything you need to know about Netflix's new Joe Exotic doc, 'Tiger King' |url=https://nypost.com/2020/03/19/everything-you-need-to-know-about-netflixs-new-joe-exotic-doc-tiger-king/ |accessdate=March 20, 2020 |work=[[New York Post]] |issue=March 19, 2020 |publisher=NYP Holdings, Inc |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200320183106/https://nypost.com/2020/03/19/everything-you-need-to-know-about-netflixs-new-joe-exotic-doc-tiger-king/ |archive-date=March 20, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table |background=#B60006 |overall= |title= |director= |airdate= |country=U.S. |released=y |episodes= \n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 1\n |Title = Not Your Average Joe\n |DirectedBy = [[Eric Goode]] & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 2\n |Title = Cult of Personality\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 3\n |Title = The Secret\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 4\n |Title = Playing with Fire\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 5\n |Title = Make America Exotic Again\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 6\n |Title = The Noble Thing to Do\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 7\n |Title = Dethroned\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n}}\n\n===Special===\n{{Episode table |background=#B60006 |overall= |title= |airdate= |country=U.S. |released=y |episodes= \n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 8\n |Title = The Tiger King and I\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|12}}\n |ShortSummary = Special after-show hosted by [[Joel McHale]] \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nOn review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the series holds an approval rating of 89% based on 75 reviews, with an average rating of 7.88/10.

It is named for the town of Ash Fork, and for Francis H. Bainbridge, a [[civil engineer]] and graduate of [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] (RPI), a member of the [[Rensselaer Society of Engineers]], and an engineer for ATSF.<ref>According to material found in this PDF: [http://www.azsce.org/downloads/history-150thAnniversaryBooklet.pdf Arizona Society of Civil Engineers 150th anniversary booklet], Bainbridge invented the steel dam and obtained a United States patent on it, No. 537,520, filed September 11, 1894</ref>  The dam has been listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] since 1976.<ref name=nris />\n\n==Background==\nThe ATSF and other railroads had to make special provisions for water supply in desert conditions, as [[Condenser (heat transfer)|non condensing]] [[steam locomotive]]s <ref>The sort typically used in the United States, even in very arid conditions</ref> consumed a prodigious amount of water. The usual approach was to construct a dam to retain surface water, or to drill a series of [[water well|well]]s, and store the water in a [[water tank]]. Railroad communities often grew up around these reservoirs or [[water stop]]s. Ash Fork had been such a town from when the ATSF first arrived some years earlier although it had been a way point for [[stagecoach]] lines previously.\n\nRailroads in the U.S. and elsewhere had been leaders in structural development. The [[masonry]] [[arch bridge]]s and viaducts of the early 19th century had given way to bridges made mostly of [[steel]], with considerable economy of material, construction cost, and time, and Bainbridge speculated that similar savings might be possible for dams. This dam was a significant departure from the more typical [[masonry]] construction. Already familiar with the construction of the ATSF's many steel bridges, Bainbridge decided to see whether steel construction could replace masonry in dams as well. The dam's light weight and prefabricated components must have made assembly easy relative to the laborious job of quarrying and setting stone.\n\nSteel dams use relatively thin steel plates in contact with the water surface, with a framework of steel behind them transmitting the load to the ground. The plates are slanted upwards in the direction of water flow, so that the weight of the water puts [[compression (physical)|compressive]] forces on the girders holding the plates up. This transmits force to the ground without the [[moment (physics)|bending moment]] that a vertical wall of plates would engender. It was believed that these dams could be constructed faster and more cheaply than masonry dams.\n\n==Location==\nThe dam lies about {{convert|3|mi|km}} to the east of Ash Fork, in Johnson Canyon, and about {{convert|15|mi|km}} west of [[Williams, Arizona]]. It is near the former [[U.S. Route 66]] and [[Interstate 40]]. About a mile upstream lies Stone Dam, a masonry structure constructed 13 years later. The [[Grand Canyon Railway]] originates in Williams, branching from the ATSF main that this dam served, and runs northeast to the [[Grand Canyon]].\n\n==Construction details==\nThe dam was fabricated by the [[Wisconsin Bridge and Iron Company]] and shipped to the site in pieces for erection. Construction of the dam began in 1897 and was completed March 5, 1898, at a total cost of US$63,519 (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|.063519|1898|r=1|fmt=c}} million today).\n\nThe structure gets its scalloped appearance from 24 curved {{nowrap|{{frac|3|8}}-inch}} ({{cvt|.375|in|mm|disp=out|}}) steel plates that slope downstream. Loose and rigid plates are alternated to compensate for a temperature range from {{convert|104|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|}} to {{convert|-4|F|||}}.

The band has been noted for McCrea's sarcastic lyrics and monotone vocals, and their wide-ranging musical influences, including [[country music]], [[Mariachi]], [[rock music|rock]], [[funk]], [[Music of Iran|Iranian folk music]] and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]].\n\nCake was formed in 1991 by McCrea, DiFiore, [[Greg Brown (rock musician)|Greg Brown]] (guitar), [[Frank French]] (drums), and Shon Meckfessel (bass) who soon left and was replaced by [[Gabe Nelson]]. Following the self-release of its debut album, ''[[Motorcade of Generosity]]'', the band was signed to [[Capricorn Records]] in 1995 and released its first single, \"[[Rock 'n' Roll Lifestyle]]\", which hit number&nbsp;35 on the [[Modern Rock Tracks]] music chart and was featured on MTV's ''[[120 Minutes]]''; French and Nelson then left the band, and were replaced by Todd Roper and [[Victor Damiani]]. Cake's second album, 1996's ''[[Fashion Nugget]]'', went platinum on the strength of its lead single, \"[[The Distance (song)|The Distance]]\". Following a tour of Europe and the United States, both Brown and Damiani announced they were leaving Cake, which led to speculation about the band's future; McCrea eventually recruited Xan McCurdy to take over on guitar, and persuaded Nelson to return.\n\n''[[Prolonging the Magic]]'', the band's third album, was released in 1998 and went platinum, having shipped over one million units; this was followed three years later by ''[[Comfort Eagle]]'', the band's first album on [[Columbia Records]], featuring the single \"[[Short Skirt/Long Jacket]]\" which hit number&nbsp;7 on the [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart. Following a series of tours, including several versions of the [[Unlimited Sunshine Tour]], the band released ''[[Pressure Chief]]'' in 2004, its second and last album on Columbia. After creating its own label, [[Upbeat Records]], the band released ''[[Showroom of Compassion]]'' in 2011, which became its first album to debut at the top of the ''Billboard'' charts, selling 44,000 copies in the first week after release.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and ''Motorcade of Generosity'' (1991\u20131996)===\nCake was formed in 1991 when John McCrea, a Sacramento, California native who had moved to Los Angeles with a band only to see it \"quickly crumble around him\", returned to Sacramento.<ref name=\"mont1\">{{cite news|title=Cake man talks about economic importance of short skirts|last=Montgomery|first=James|date=August 2, 2001|work=[[UWIRE]]}}</ref> He began looking for a new band to play with, having \"grown tired of Sacramento's coffeehouse circuit\",<ref name=\"jg1\">{{cite news|title=Taking Cake|last=Green|first=Joshua|date=October 10, 1996|work=Westword|publisher=Village Voice Media}}</ref> and quickly attracted trumpet player [[Vince DiFiore]], guitarist [[Greg Brown (rock musician)|Greg Brown]], bassist Shon Meckfessel and drummer [[Frank French]].

The band has been noted for McCrea's sarcastic lyrics and monotone vocals, and their wide-ranging musical influences, including [[country music]], [[Mariachi]], [[rock music|rock]], [[funk]], [[Music of Iran|Iranian folk music]] and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]].\n\nCake was formed in 1991 by McCrea, DiFiore, [[Greg Brown (rock musician)|Greg Brown]] (guitar), [[Frank French]] (drums), and Shon Meckfessel (bass) who soon left and was replaced by [[Gabe Nelson]]. Following the self-release of its debut album, ''[[Motorcade of Generosity]]'', the band was signed to [[Capricorn Records]] in 1995 and released its first single, \"[[Rock 'n' Roll Lifestyle]]\", which hit number&nbsp;35 on the [[Modern Rock Tracks]] music chart and was featured on MTV's ''[[120 Minutes]]''; French and Nelson then left the band, and were replaced by Todd Roper and [[Victor Damiani]]. Cake's second album, 1996's ''[[Fashion Nugget]]'', went platinum on the strength of its lead single, \"[[The Distance (song)|The Distance]]\". Following a tour of Europe and the United States, both Brown and Damiani announced they were leaving Cake, which led to speculation about the band's future; McCrea eventually recruited Xan McCurdy to take over on guitar, and persuaded Nelson to return.\n\n''[[Prolonging the Magic]]'', the band's third album, was released in 1998 and went platinum, having shipped over one million units; this was followed three years later by ''[[Comfort Eagle]]'', the band's first album on [[Columbia Records]], featuring the single \"[[Short Skirt/Long Jacket]]\" which hit number&nbsp;7 on the [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart. Following a series of tours, including several versions of the [[Unlimited Sunshine Tour]], the band released ''[[Pressure Chief]]'' in 2004, its second and last album on Columbia. After creating its own label, [[Upbeat Records]], the band released ''[[Showroom of Compassion]]'' in 2011, which became its first album to debut at the top of the ''Billboard'' charts, selling 44,000 copies in the first week after release.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and ''Motorcade of Generosity'' (1991\u20131996)===\nCake was formed in 1991 when John McCrea, a Sacramento, California native who had moved to Los Angeles with a band only to see it \"quickly crumble around him\", returned to Sacramento.<ref name=\"mont1\">{{cite news|title=Cake man talks about economic importance of short skirts|last=Montgomery|first=James|date=August 2, 2001|work=[[UWIRE]]}}</ref> He began looking for a new band to play with, having \"grown tired of Sacramento's coffeehouse circuit\",<ref name=\"jg1\">{{cite news|title=Taking Cake|last=Green|first=Joshua|date=October 10, 1996|work=Westword|publisher=Village Voice Media}}</ref> and quickly attracted trumpet player [[Vince DiFiore]], guitarist [[Greg Brown (rock musician)|Greg Brown]], bassist Shon Meckfessel and drummer [[Frank French]].

Matches between the two sides have been played almost continuously ever since a football league in Bulgaria has existed. The two teams regularly competed for the title before the Second World War. Levski have never been relegated from the top flight of Bulgarian football, while Slavia have missed only one season, for political reasons.\n\n== History ==\nSlavia Sofia and Levski Sofia are the two oldest, still-existing football teams from Sofia. Both Slavia and Levski won the Bulgarian Republican Championship several times prior to the Second World War. Slavia managed to win six national titles before 1945, while Levski won three. \n\nAfter 1948, with the changing political situation in Bulgaria, the two teams were affected very differently. Levski Sofia became supported and financed by the ministry of internal affairs, and quickly became one of the two main contenders for the title in the upcoming years, along with rivals [[CSKA Sofia]]. Slavia, on the other hand, was not affiliated to any governmental institution, and became less prominent and successful, especially after the creation of CSKA Sofia in 1948. Nonetheless, Slavia managed to compete in the Bulgarian [[A PFG]] throughout most of its history, occasionally providing competition for CSKA and Levski Sofia.\n\nThe two teams are also among the most successful when it comes to the [[Bulgarian Cup]]. Levski has won a record 25, while Slavia has won 8. They have also played against each other twice in the finals of the competition. The first final between them occurred in 1996. The match did not even finish, with Slavia being awarded a [[walkover]] in their favor, due to Levski deciding to abandon the game in the 75th minute. Twenty two years later, the two sides again met in the final, in 2018. [[2017-18 Bulgarian Cup|In the 2018 edition ]], the game ended in a goalless draw, after which Slavia won on penalties, thus winning their eight title overall.\n\n==  Official match statistics==\n{{updated|20 October 2019}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!\n!

Matches between the two sides have been played almost continuously ever since a football league in Bulgaria has existed. The two teams regularly competed for the title before the Second World War. Levski have never been relegated from the top flight of Bulgarian football, while Slavia have missed only one season, for political reasons.\n\n== History ==\nSlavia Sofia and Levski Sofia are the two oldest, still-existing football teams from Sofia. Both Slavia and Levski won the Bulgarian Republican Championship several times prior to the Second World War. Slavia managed to win six national titles before 1945, while Levski won three. \n\nAfter 1948, with the changing political situation in Bulgaria, the two teams were affected very differently. Levski Sofia became supported and financed by the ministry of internal affairs, and quickly became one of the two main contenders for the title in the upcoming years, along with rivals [[CSKA Sofia]]. Slavia, on the other hand, was not affiliated to any governmental institution, and became less prominent and successful, especially after the creation of CSKA Sofia in 1948. Nonetheless, Slavia managed to compete in the Bulgarian [[A PFG]] throughout most of its history, occasionally providing competition for CSKA and Levski Sofia.\n\nThe two teams are also among the most successful when it comes to the [[Bulgarian Cup]]. Levski has won a record 25, while Slavia has won 8. They have also played against each other twice in the finals of the competition. The first final between them occurred in 1996. The match did not even finish, with Slavia being awarded a [[walkover]] in their favor, due to Levski deciding to abandon the game in the 75th minute. Twenty two years later, the two sides again met in the final, in 2018. [[2017-18 Bulgarian Cup|In the 2018 edition ]], the game ended in a goalless draw, after which Slavia won on penalties, thus winning their eight title overall.\n\n==  Official match statistics==\n{{updated|20 October 2019}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!\n!

In 1951, the parish became part of the newly erected [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Sorsogon]], of which the Most Rev. Teopisto Alberto was its first Bishop. Then parish priest Msgr. Arnulfo Arcilla (later made bishop of Sorsogon) laid down the foundation of the first structures of the cathedral-parish in 1954.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|20.3|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|20.0|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.3|sqmi|km2}}, or 1.53 percent, is water. Almost all of Acton is forested, except for where it has been cleared for residential or agricultural use. Some forested areas have been put aside for special use by corporations.\n\nThe current geography of Acton was created when the last wave of [[glacier]]s retreated approximately ten thousand years ago. Acton has nine [[drumlin]]s&nbsp;\u2014 hills which are composed of glacial [[till]]. In addition, Wills Hole and Grassy Pond are [[kettle (landform)|kettle]] ponds which were formed in depressions in the till formed by large blocks of ice.\n\nActon has two primary stream systems: the Nashoba Brook system including the incoming streams Butter Brook, Wills Hole Brook and Conant Brook and the Fort Pond Brook system including the incoming streams Guggins Brook, Inch Brook, Grassy Pond Brook, Pratt's Brook and Coles Brook. Both stream systems empty into the [[Assabet River]], which passes briefly through the town at its southern corner. Nagog Pond in the north, forms Acton's border with the Town of Littleton and provides drinking water to the Town of Concord. A small artificial pond is at NARA Park in North Acton.\n{{clearleft}}\n\n===The five village centers===\n\nWhile Acton Center has been the civic center of the town since the revolution, the four other village centers earned their nomenclature from the names of their corresponding railroad station.\n*Acton Center is the civic center of the town and is the site of the [[town hall]], the main [[public library]] ([[Acton Memorial Library]]), a children's [[playground]], an [[obelisk]] monument commemorating Acton deaths in \"[[Battles of Lexington and Concord|the Concord Fight]]\" of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], a fire station, the [[Acton Congregational Church]], a {{convert|64|acre|m2|adj=on}} [[arboretum]] and [[conservation area]], and the former [[post office]]. The modern post office and the [[police station]] are each located about one-half mile away in opposite directions along Main Street. Otherwise, Acton Center is generally a residential area.\n*West Acton is an important commercial area of town, consisting of several commercial developments centered along Route 111. It developed in response to the growth of the [[Fitchburg Railroad]] in the 19th century. \n[[File:South Acton, Mass. (2674436396).jpg|thumb|[[Lithograph]] of South Acton from 1886 by [[L.R. Burleigh]] with list of landmarks]]\n*South Acton used to be the most [[industry|industrialized]] area of the town of Acton. In the 18th century, this area held many mills and other small industrial developments that used [[hydropower|water power]] generated by Fort Pond Brook. The area includes the Faulkner Homestead ('[[Faulkner House]]'), the oldest home still standing in Acton (dating back to 1707). The Faulkner Homestead was owned by the Faulkner family who also owned and ran a mill across the street. [[Jones Tavern]] is another still-standing revolutionary-era structure in South Acton that is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. The [[South Acton (MBTA station)]] is the only rail station on the Fitchburg line still active in Acton.\n*East Acton was originally a small commercial area that grew up around the East Acton train station in the 19th century. With the advent of the automobile, and the demise of this branch of the railroad, East Acton became a largely residential area with a commercial base that is situated along the [[Massachusetts Route 2A|Route 2A]] corridor.\n*North Acton has had major growth in the period since 1975\u201380. With the growth of the Route 2A/[[Massachusetts Route 119|119]] corridor, North Acton has developed many commercial complexes and [[condominium]] buildings.

There is evidence of Native American settlements in Acton which go back 7,000 years.

The Acton minutemen were led by Captain [[Isaac Davis (soldier)|Isaac Davis]]. When a company was needed to lead the advance on the bridge which was defended by the British regulars, Captain Davis was heard to reply, \"I haven't a man who is afraid to go.\" The Acton men led because, unlike other militias there, they were fully equipped with [[bayonet]]s.\n\nThe colonists advanced on the bridge; in the exchange of [[musket]] fire that followed, Captain Isaac Davis and Private Abner Hosmer of Acton were killed. Davis was the first officer to die in the American Revolutionary War. In Acton they refer to \"the battle of Lexington, fought in Concord, by men of Acton.\"\n\n===Industrialization and Civil War===\nDuring the 19th century, Acton participated in the growing [[Industrial Revolution]]. By the mid-19th century, Acton was an industrial center for the production of [[barrel]]s (cooperage). There were also a [[powder mill]], three [[gristmill]]s and four [[sawmill]]s in town.<ref>Acton Historical Society: \"A Brief History of Acton\", page 33.

The [[Fitchburg Railroad]] was routed through South and West Acton so that it could serve the mills. South Acton became a busy rail center and was the division point for the [[Marlborough Branch]] Railroad. With the railroad came increasing development in those areas. In addition to the Fitchburg Railroad, two others crossed the town: the [[Nashua and Acton]], and the [[Framingham and Lowell]]. These two railroads shared a [[double track]] right-of-way that ran from [[West Concord, Massachusetts|West Concord]] (aka Concord Junction) through East Acton and then splitting in North Acton in the vicinity of [[Massachusetts Route 27|Route 27]] and Ledge Rock Way.\n\nIn 1874, the population of the town was almost 1700. The town established its first newspaper, ''The Acton Patriot'', and the residents of West Acton formed the first library, The Citizen's Library. In 1890, the Memorial Library was completed and given to the town by William A. Wilde as a memorial to the Acton soldiers who fought in the Civil War.\n\n==Government==\nActon uses the [[Open Town Meeting]] form of town government. The [[town charter]] specifies that the annual town meeting must begin on the first Monday in April. The [[selectmen]] may also call a special town meeting at other times of the year to consider other business. Citizens may force a special town meeting by submitting a petition signed by 200 registered voters to the town clerk. Anyone may attend Town Meeting but only registered voters may vote. Acton also has a water district, which is run separately from town government, as a public utility.\n\nActon's elected officials include the following: the [[Board of Selectmen]] (5 members, 3-year terms), the [[Town Moderator]] (1 person, 1-year term), Acton members of the Acton-Boxborough Regional School Committee (7 members, 3-year terms), the Housing Authority (4 members, 5-year terms) and Memorial Library Trustees (3 members, 3-year terms). In addition, the town moderator appoints a finance committee (9 members, 3-year terms) which issues an opinion on each of the warrant articles presented to Town Meeting. In addition, a separate and independent branch of government, the [http://www.actonwater.com Acton Water District], was established in 1912 and consists of three elected Commissioners, an elected Moderator, an elected Clerk, an appointed District Counsel, Finance Committee, Water Land Management Advisory Committee, and paid professional staff.\n\nThe town services are primarily funded through the residential property tax, which is subject to the limitations imposed by state statute known as [[Proposition 2\u00bd]]. The Water District is funded through water rates, connection fees and property rental. The Water District revenues, however, are not subject to Proposition 2\u00bd.\n\n===State and federal government===\nOn the state level, Acton is represented in the [[Massachusetts Senate]] by James \"Jamie\" Eldridge, and in the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] by Jennifer Benson and Tami Gouveia. On the federal level, Acton is part of [[Massachusetts's 3rd congressional district]], represented by [[Lori Trahan]]. The state's senior ([[Classes of United States Senators#Class I|Class I]]) member of the [[United States Senate]] is [[Elizabeth Warren]]. The junior ([[Classes of United States Senators#Class II|Class II]]) senator is [[Ed Markey]].\n\n===Civic infrastructure===\nThe civic infrastructure grew to accommodate the increasing population. A Water District was established in 1912 and a town-wide Fire Department was established in 1913. Acton was the first town in the area to have water-bound [[macadam]] highways.\n\nIn 2005 a new Public Safety Facility was built that expanded space for the Police Department and provided for a Joint Dispatch area with the Fire Department.\n\n====Water district====\nThe Acton Water District is a community public water supply that delivers drinking water to the majority (about 90 percent) of the residents of the town of Acton, Massachusetts. All of the water provided from the District comes from seven [[water well|wells]] located within the town of Acton. The District's system consists of {{convert|106|mi|km|0}} of water main, four storage tanks, and water treatment facilities including aeration, activated granulated carbon (GAC), an advanced Zenon(R) filtration facility, plus [[fluoridation]] and state mandated chlorination.\n\n====Sewers====\nMost homes and businesses in Acton (approximately 80%) use private on-site sewage systems (i.e. [[septic tank]]s). Higher density developments such as condominiums and apartment buildings (approximately 10% of the town) use private sewers which go to small-scale private treatment plants.\n\nIn 2001, Acton completed its first public sewer system, which serves approximately 10% of the town, primarily in South Acton. A betterment fee is charged to property owners whose property is sited proximate to the sewage lines, whether or not they connect to the system.\n\n==Town Recreation Areas==\n\n===Conservation lands===\nActon has a total of over {{convert|1650|acre|km2|0}} of town-owned conservation lands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.actontrails.org|title=Acton Trails - Acton Conservation Lands|website=www.actontrails.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210083846/http://www.actontrails.org/|archivedate=2012-02-10}}</ref>\n\n*'''Acton Arboretum:''' A park in the center of Acton which consists of {{convert|53|acre|m2}} of woods, meadows, swamp, ponds, old apple orchards, a glacial [[esker]], and a bog.

The Acton section of the BFRT officially opened April 3, 2018, and runs north through the communities of Carlisle, Westford, Chelmsford and Lowell.  When complete, the BFRT will run 25 miles along the former rail bed of the Framingham and Lowell Railroad, continuing south through Concord, Sudbury and Framingham.\n* [[Assabet River Rail Trail]]. Running along the rail bed of Boston & Maine Railroad's former Marlborough Branch, the Acton portion of the trail starts at MBTA's South Acton Train Station and runs 3.4 miles south through Maynard to the Maynard:Stow border, where it then continues another 1.8 miles as a dirt road on private property with allowed public access.\n\n==Education==\nAt the beginning of the 20th century{{which|date=December 2016}}, each village in Acton had its own grade school, but the town struggled with how to provide a high school education for its students. Until 1925, Acton students were sent to Concord's high school.\n\nIn 1953, new schools were constructed to accommodate the growth in the student population. In 1957, Acton and [[Boxborough, Massachusetts|Boxborough]] created a regional school district for grades 7\u201312. In 2014, the regional school district was expanded to include the elementary schools of each town. The Merriam School (building has been split in 1970 to two schools, Merriam School on the right, and McCarthy-Towne School on the left. Building is called Parker Damon building) was constructed in 1958. Other schools quickly followed: Douglas (1966), Gates (1968), and Conant (1971). In 1967 a building was constructed for the junior high. In 1973 a huge addition was added to this building and it became the high school; the junior high moved to the old high school building.\n\n===Elementary Schools in Acton===\n\nThe [[Acton Boxborough Regional School District]] operates five elementary schools in Acton as well as Acton public School Pre-school. The School District also operates the Blanchard Elementary school in neighboring [[Boxborough, Massachusetts|Boxborough]].\n\nActon has an uncommon method of assigning students to elementary schools, called \"Open Enrollment.\" First-time incoming kindergarten parents participate in a lottery-based selection process where the parents \"choose\" the school by listing their preferences in ranked order. Boxborough students have priority for attendance in the school in their own town, but participate in the lottery if they wish to attend an Acton school. Any remaining spaces at Blanchard become available in the lottery.\n\nThis method of school choice has a large impact on the nature of the town. Acton is less oriented around neighborhoods than towns which have neighborhood based schools. This carries over into the recreational youth sport organizations whose teams are not organized around specific elementary schools. As a result, students and families are likely to have broad social connections in all parts of the town rather than being limited to neighborhoods. School Choice also benefits the towns real estate market since home valuations are not impacted by the perceived desirability of given neighborhood's school.\n\nWhile the curriculum in the district is fairly standardized, each of the elementary schools has a different teaching philosophy. The schools and their philosophy of education are:\n*Conant School. Named for Luther Conant who taught for 17 years in the school district, served on the School Committee, and was Town Moderator for 40 years. The school emphasizes the [[Whole language]] approach when teaching students to read. The Conant School has an [[English language learning and teaching|English as a Second Language]] (ESL) program.\n*Douglas School. Named for Carolyn T. Douglas who was a teacher and principal in the Acton schools from 1940 to 1967. The school emphasizes [[Phonics]] for learning to read. The Douglas School has an ESL program (English as a Second Language).\n*Gates School. Named for Paul P. Gates who was the school physician from 1948 to 1968. The school emphasizes Phonics for learning to read.\n*McCarthy-Towne School. Named for Julia McCarthy who taught at the South Acton School from 1906 to 1952 and Marion Towne who was a teacher in the primary and secondary schools in Acton from 1921 to 1959. McCarthy-Towne integrates language arts, math, social studies, science and art in the study of curriculum \"units.\" The school has an ESL (English as a Second Language) program and also includes two CASE (Concord Area Special Education) classrooms. McCarthy-Towne has a very active parent volunteer program. McCarthy-Towne School is housed in the Parker Damon Building (named for McCarthy-Towne's first principal, J. Parker Damon), which it shares with the Merriam School. At McCarthy-Towne, students generally call their teachers by their first names, a practice shared by Merriam.\n*Merriam School. Named for Florence A. Merriam who taught for 35 years in Acton. Merriam offers a project-based curriculum. At Merriam, teachers teach the same group of students for two years (i.e., a teacher will teach first grade one year, second grade the next and then wrap back to first). This practice is called \"looping\". Merriam School is housed in the Parker Damon Building which it shares with the McCarthy-Towne school. At Merriam as well as at McCarthy-Towne, students call their teachers by their first names.\n\n===Acton-Boxborough Junior High and High School===\n\n'''The Acton-Boxborough Regional School''' has a single Junior High School ([[Raymond J. Grey Junior High School]]) for grades 7 & 8 and a single High School ([[Acton-Boxborough Regional High School]]) for grades 9 through 12. The regional district accepts some students from other neighboring towns as 'choice' students if the school committee decides this is in the best interest of the district. Both the junior high and high school were enlarged and renovated in 2000\u20132005. Both buildings are located at the school district campus in Acton.\n\nCurrent enrollment at the Junior High is approximately 1,000 students while the High School has roughly 2,000 students. The High School was ranked as the 3rd best public school in the Greater Boston area (defined as within I-495) by Boston Magazine in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonmagazine.com/best-public-schools-boston-2014-top-50/|title=Best Public Schools in Boston 2014 \u2013 Top 50 Ranking - Boston Magazine|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140908202354/http://www.bostonmagazine.com/best-public-schools-boston-2014-top-50/|archivedate=2014-09-08}}</ref>\n\n==Cultural institutions==\n[[Image:ActonMemorialLibrary2.jpg|thumb|Acton Memorial Library]]\n\n===Libraries===\nActon has two public [[library|libraries]]: the Acton Memorial Library and the West Acton Citizens' Library. The Acton Memorial Library was given to the town of Acton by William Allan Wilde as a memorial to its [[American Civil War|Civil War]] veterans in 1890. The building was expanded in 1967, and a second major expansion was completed in 1999. There are also libraries in each of the elementary schools, the Junior High, and the High School. The Acton Historical Society owns the Jenks Library which contains historical maps, documents, photographs and drawings.\n\n===Museums===\n* [[The Discovery Museums]] are two separate [[science museum]]s located on the same site. The Children's Discovery Museum has exhibits suitable for younger children, while the Science Discovery Museum focuses on older children. The location is well guarded by Bessie, the large [[dinosaur]] statue and museum mascot, located in the front grounds of the facility.\n*Iron Work Farm: Settlement of South Acton; 'Iron Work Farm in Acton, Inc.' is a non-profit, historical corporation chartered in Massachusetts since 1964, that operates two historic houses: [[Jones Tavern]] and [[Faulkner House]]. Each house is open to the public on the last Sunday of the month from May to October. The facilities are also open as part of the local [[Patriots' Day]] holiday observance each April.\n*Hosmer House: This [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]-era home, which is owned and maintained by the Acton Historical Society, is typically open to the public on [[Patriots' Day]], September 27 ('Crown Resistance Day'), as well as May 27 and June 24, from 2 to 4 o'clock.\n\n===Theater===\nThough there are several [[theater]] groups in Acton, the two eldest are Theatre III and Open Door Theater. The multi award-winning Theatre III was founded in 1956 when three organizations (a local chorus, dance group, and dramatic troupe) combined to present a show. It produces several plays and musicals each season in the historical old church building on Central Street.\n\nOpen Door Theater is a [[community theater]] group which was founded to provide an inclusive theater experience. Open Door produces one large musical each year which features a large number of performers ranging in age from 9 to adult including people with special needs. They perform and rehearse in the Dragonfly Theatre, located inside the R. J. Grey Junior High School.\n\n===Traditions===\n[[File:4th of July 2015 in Acton.jpg|thumb|[[4th of July]] 2015 [[Fireworks]] in Acton]]\n\n* Each year on [[Patriots' Day]] (traditionally April 19; since 1969, observed on the 3rd Monday in April as part of a 3-day Patriots' Day weekend), the Acton Minutemen<ref>{{cite web |author=Steve Crosby |url=http://www.actonminutemen.org/index.html |title=Acton Minutemen home page |publisher=Actonminutemen.org |accessdate=2008-11-24 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306020006/http://www.actonminutemen.org/index.html |archivedate=2009-03-06 }}</ref> lead a march from Acton Center to the Old North Bridge in Concord.

The main part of the [[tavern]], originally home to the Jones family of South Acton, was built in 1732 as a house for Samuel Jones, Jr. By 1750 it had become a tavern and [[general store]]. It is speculated to be the first store in Acton and holds the distinction of being the town's longest established business, merging into James Tuttle's store in 1845 and operating under various names until 1950.\n* The Faulkner House and Mills.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ironworkfarm.org/jonestavern.htm |title=Jones Tavern |publisher=Ironworkfarm.org |accessdate=2008-11-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820071028/http://www.ironworkfarm.org/jonestavern.htm |archivedate=August 20, 2008 }}</ref> The house was built for Ephraim Jones (1679\u20131710), founder in 1702 of an early [[textile]] business and other mills that formed the nucleus of the present town of Acton. Ammi Ruhamah Faulkner rented the mills in 1738 and then purchased them in 1742. Six generations of Faulkners lived in the house over a 202-year period. The largest and most central house of this settlement, it served as the local garrison house for protection from Indian raids made along the Massachusetts frontier during [[Queen Anne's War]] of 1702\u20131713. The Faulkner homestead served as a [[garrison]] for South Acton Militia during the Revolutionary War.\n* Town Center: The civic center of town is marked by the Acton Monument which is the final resting place of Captain Isaac Davis, James Hayward and Abner Hosmer. The stone on which Captain Davis mortally fell is situated between the west side of the monument and Main Street. The main entrance to the Town Hall, around the rear of the building, contains Isaac Davis's plow which was used by Daniel Chester French for the statue he cast for North Bridge.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[Image:Acton Road Signs 1.jpg|thumb|Antique road sign in a well near Acton Center, along [[Massachusetts Route 27|Route 27]]]]\n\nActon is {{convert|5|mi|km|spell=in}} from [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|I-495]] and {{convert|10|mi|km|spell=in}} from [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|I-95]]/[[Route 128 (Massachusetts)|Route 128]].

The population was 21,929 at the 2010 census. It is bordered by [[Westford, Massachusetts|Westford]] and [[Littleton, Massachusetts|Littleton]] to the north, [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]] and [[Carlisle, Massachusetts|Carlisle]] to the east, [[Stow, Massachusetts|Stow]], [[Maynard, Massachusetts|Maynard]], and [[Sudbury, Massachusetts|Sudbury]] to the south and [[Boxborough, Massachusetts|Boxborough]] to the west. Acton became an incorporated town in 1735. The town employs the [[Open Town Meeting]] form of government with a Town Manager and an elected, five-member Board of Selectmen. Acton was named the 11th Best Place To Live among small towns in the country by [[Money (magazine)|Money Magazine]] in 2015, and the 16th best in 2009 and in 2011.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/bplive/2009/snapshots/CS2500380.html |title=BEST PLACES TO LIVE: Money's list of America's best small towns |accessdate=18 May 2013 |work=CNN |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130314042908/http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/bplive/2009/snapshots/CS2500380.html |archivedate=14 March 2013 }}</ref> The local high school, [[Acton-Boxborough Regional High School]], was named a [[Blue Ribbon Schools Program|Blue Ribbon School]] by the [[U.S. Department of Education]] in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wickedlocal.com/acton/news/education/x593052417/Acton-Boxborough-Regional-High-named-Blue-Ribbon-school |title=Acton-Boxborough Regional High named Blue Ribbon School |date=September 28, 2009 |author=Stephen Vittorioso |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108105437/http://www.wickedlocal.com/acton/news/education/x593052417/Acton-Boxborough-Regional-High-named-Blue-Ribbon-school |archivedate=2012-11-08 }}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Acton Massachusetts wetlands.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wetlands]] in Acton off of Massachusetts Avenue, summer 2015.]]\n\nActon is located at {{coord|42|29|N|71|27|W}}. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|20.3|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|20.0|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.3|sqmi|km2}}, or 1.53 percent, is water. Almost all of Acton is forested, except for where it has been cleared for residential or agricultural use. Some forested areas have been put aside for special use by corporations.\n\nThe current geography of Acton was created when the last wave of [[glacier]]s retreated approximately ten thousand years ago. Acton has nine [[drumlin]]s&nbsp;\u2014 hills which are composed of glacial [[till]]. In addition, Wills Hole and Grassy Pond are [[kettle (landform)|kettle]] ponds which were formed in depressions in the till formed by large blocks of ice.\n\nActon has two primary stream systems: the Nashoba Brook system including the incoming streams Butter Brook, Wills Hole Brook and Conant Brook and the Fort Pond Brook system including the incoming streams Guggins Brook, Inch Brook, Grassy Pond Brook, Pratt's Brook and Coles Brook. Both stream systems empty into the [[Assabet River]], which passes briefly through the town at its southern corner. Nagog Pond in the north, forms Acton's border with the Town of Littleton and provides drinking water to the Town of Concord. A small artificial pond is at NARA Park in North Acton.\n{{clearleft}}\n\n===The five village centers===\n\nWhile Acton Center has been the civic center of the town since the revolution, the four other village centers earned their nomenclature from the names of their corresponding railroad station.\n*Acton Center is the civic center of the town and is the site of the [[town hall]], the main [[public library]] ([[Acton Memorial Library]]), a children's [[playground]], an [[obelisk]] monument commemorating Acton deaths in \"[[Battles of Lexington and Concord|the Concord Fight]]\" of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], a fire station, the [[Acton Congregational Church]], a {{convert|64|acre|m2|adj=on}} [[arboretum]] and [[conservation area]], and the former [[post office]]. The modern post office and the [[police station]] are each located about one-half mile away in opposite directions along Main Street. Otherwise, Acton Center is generally a residential area.\n*West Acton is an important commercial area of town, consisting of several commercial developments centered along Route 111. It developed in response to the growth of the [[Fitchburg Railroad]] in the 19th century. \n[[File:South Acton, Mass. (2674436396).jpg|thumb|[[Lithograph]] of South Acton from 1886 by [[L.R. Burleigh]] with list of landmarks]]\n*South Acton used to be the most [[industry|industrialized]] area of the town of Acton. In the 18th century, this area held many mills and other small industrial developments that used [[hydropower|water power]] generated by Fort Pond Brook. The area includes the Faulkner Homestead ('[[Faulkner House]]'), the oldest home still standing in Acton (dating back to 1707). The Faulkner Homestead was owned by the Faulkner family who also owned and ran a mill across the street. [[Jones Tavern]] is another still-standing revolutionary-era structure in South Acton that is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. The [[South Acton (MBTA station)]] is the only rail station on the Fitchburg line still active in Acton.\n*East Acton was originally a small commercial area that grew up around the East Acton train station in the 19th century. With the advent of the automobile, and the demise of this branch of the railroad, East Acton became a largely residential area with a commercial base that is situated along the [[Massachusetts Route 2A|Route 2A]] corridor.\n*North Acton has had major growth in the period since 1975\u201380. With the growth of the Route 2A/[[Massachusetts Route 119|119]] corridor, North Acton has developed many commercial complexes and [[condominium]] buildings.

There is evidence of Native American settlements in Acton which go back 7,000 years.

The Acton minutemen were led by Captain [[Isaac Davis (soldier)|Isaac Davis]]. When a company was needed to lead the advance on the bridge which was defended by the British regulars, Captain Davis was heard to reply, \"I haven't a man who is afraid to go.\" The Acton men led because, unlike other militias there, they were fully equipped with [[bayonet]]s.\n\nThe colonists advanced on the bridge; in the exchange of [[musket]] fire that followed, Captain Isaac Davis and Private Abner Hosmer of Acton were killed. Davis was the first officer to die in the American Revolutionary War. In Acton they refer to \"the battle of Lexington, fought in Concord, by men of Acton.\"\n\n===Industrialization and Civil War===\nDuring the 19th century, Acton participated in the growing [[Industrial Revolution]]. By the mid-19th century, Acton was an industrial center for the production of [[barrel]]s (cooperage). There were also a [[powder mill]], three [[gristmill]]s and four [[sawmill]]s in town.<ref>Acton Historical Society: \"A Brief History of Acton\", page 33.

The [[Fitchburg Railroad]] was routed through South and West Acton so that it could serve the mills. South Acton became a busy rail center and was the division point for the [[Marlborough Branch]] Railroad. With the railroad came increasing development in those areas. In addition to the Fitchburg Railroad, two others crossed the town: the [[Nashua and Acton]], and the [[Framingham and Lowell]]. These two railroads shared a [[double track]] right-of-way that ran from [[West Concord, Massachusetts|West Concord]] (aka Concord Junction) through East Acton and then splitting in North Acton in the vicinity of [[Massachusetts Route 27|Route 27]] and Ledge Rock Way.\n\nIn 1874, the population of the town was almost 1700. The town established its first newspaper, ''The Acton Patriot'', and the residents of West Acton formed the first library, The Citizen's Library. In 1890, the Memorial Library was completed and given to the town by William A. Wilde as a memorial to the Acton soldiers who fought in the Civil War.\n\n==Government==\nActon uses the [[Open Town Meeting]] form of town government. The [[town charter]] specifies that the annual town meeting must begin on the first Monday in April. The [[selectmen]] may also call a special town meeting at other times of the year to consider other business. Citizens may force a special town meeting by submitting a petition signed by 200 registered voters to the town clerk. Anyone may attend Town Meeting but only registered voters may vote. Acton also has a water district, which is run separately from town government, as a public utility.\n\nActon's elected officials include the following: the [[Board of Selectmen]] (5 members, 3-year terms), the [[Town Moderator]] (1 person, 1-year term), Acton members of the Acton-Boxborough Regional School Committee (7 members, 3-year terms), the Housing Authority (4 members, 5-year terms) and Memorial Library Trustees (3 members, 3-year terms). In addition, the town moderator appoints a finance committee (9 members, 3-year terms) which issues an opinion on each of the warrant articles presented to Town Meeting. In addition, a separate and independent branch of government, the [http://www.actonwater.com Acton Water District], was established in 1912 and consists of three elected Commissioners, an elected Moderator, an elected Clerk, an appointed District Counsel, Finance Committee, Water Land Management Advisory Committee, and paid professional staff.\n\nThe town services are primarily funded through the residential property tax, which is subject to the limitations imposed by state statute known as [[Proposition 2\u00bd]]. The Water District is funded through water rates, connection fees and property rental. The Water District revenues, however, are not subject to Proposition 2\u00bd.\n\n===State and federal government===\nOn the state level, Acton is represented in the [[Massachusetts Senate]] by James \"Jamie\" Eldridge, and in the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] by Jennifer Benson and Tami Gouveia. On the federal level, Acton is part of [[Massachusetts's 3rd congressional district]], represented by [[Lori Trahan]]. The state's senior ([[Classes of United States Senators#Class I|Class I]]) member of the [[United States Senate]] is [[Elizabeth Warren]]. The junior ([[Classes of United States Senators#Class II|Class II]]) senator is [[Ed Markey]].\n\n===Civic infrastructure===\nThe civic infrastructure grew to accommodate the increasing population. A Water District was established in 1912 and a town-wide Fire Department was established in 1913. Acton was the first town in the area to have water-bound [[macadam]] highways.\n\nIn 2005 a new Public Safety Facility was built that expanded space for the Police Department and provided for a Joint Dispatch area with the Fire Department.\n\n====Water district====\nThe Acton Water District is a community public water supply that delivers drinking water to the majority (about 90 percent) of the residents of the town of Acton, Massachusetts. All of the water provided from the District comes from seven [[water well|wells]] located within the town of Acton. The District's system consists of {{convert|106|mi|km|0}} of water main, four storage tanks, and water treatment facilities including aeration, activated granulated carbon (GAC), an advanced Zenon(R) filtration facility, plus [[fluoridation]] and state mandated chlorination.\n\n====Sewers====\nMost homes and businesses in Acton (approximately 80%) use private on-site sewage systems (i.e. [[septic tank]]s). Higher density developments such as condominiums and apartment buildings (approximately 10% of the town) use private sewers which go to small-scale private treatment plants.\n\nIn 2001, Acton completed its first public sewer system, which serves approximately 10% of the town, primarily in South Acton. A betterment fee is charged to property owners whose property is sited proximate to the sewage lines, whether or not they connect to the system.\n\n==Town Recreation Areas==\n\n===Conservation lands===\nActon has a total of over {{convert|1650|acre|km2|0}} of town-owned conservation lands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.actontrails.org|title=Acton Trails - Acton Conservation Lands|website=www.actontrails.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210083846/http://www.actontrails.org/|archivedate=2012-02-10}}</ref>\n\n*'''Acton Arboretum:''' A park in the center of Acton which consists of {{convert|53|acre|m2}} of woods, meadows, swamp, ponds, old apple orchards, a glacial [[esker]], and a bog.

The Acton section of the BFRT officially opened April 3, 2018, and runs north through the communities of Carlisle, Westford, Chelmsford and Lowell.  When complete, the BFRT will run 25 miles along the former rail bed of the Framingham and Lowell Railroad, continuing south through Concord, Sudbury and Framingham.\n* [[Assabet River Rail Trail]]. Running along the rail bed of Boston & Maine Railroad's former Marlborough Branch, the Acton portion of the trail starts at MBTA's South Acton Train Station and runs 3.4 miles south through Maynard to the Maynard:Stow border, where it then continues another 1.8 miles as a dirt road on private property with allowed public access.\n\n==Education==\nAt the beginning of the 20th century{{which|date=December 2016}}, each village in Acton had its own grade school, but the town struggled with how to provide a high school education for its students. Until 1925, Acton students were sent to Concord's high school.\n\nIn 1953, new schools were constructed to accommodate the growth in the student population. In 1957, Acton and [[Boxborough, Massachusetts|Boxborough]] created a regional school district for grades 7\u201312. In 2014, the regional school district was expanded to include the elementary schools of each town. The Merriam School (building has been split in 1970 to two schools, Merriam School on the right, and McCarthy-Towne School on the left. Building is called Parker Damon building) was constructed in 1958. Other schools quickly followed: Douglas (1966), Gates (1968), and Conant (1971). In 1967 a building was constructed for the junior high. In 1973 a huge addition was added to this building and it became the high school; the junior high moved to the old high school building.\n\n===Elementary Schools in Acton===\n\nThe [[Acton Boxborough Regional School District]] operates five elementary schools in Acton as well as Acton public School Pre-school. The School District also operates the Blanchard Elementary school in neighboring [[Boxborough, Massachusetts|Boxborough]].\n\nActon has an uncommon method of assigning students to elementary schools, called \"Open Enrollment.\" First-time incoming kindergarten parents participate in a lottery-based selection process where the parents \"choose\" the school by listing their preferences in ranked order. Boxborough students have priority for attendance in the school in their own town, but participate in the lottery if they wish to attend an Acton school. Any remaining spaces at Blanchard become available in the lottery.\n\nThis method of school choice has a large impact on the nature of the town. Acton is less oriented around neighborhoods than towns which have neighborhood based schools. This carries over into the recreational youth sport organizations whose teams are not organized around specific elementary schools. As a result, students and families are likely to have broad social connections in all parts of the town rather than being limited to neighborhoods. School Choice also benefits the towns real estate market since home valuations are not impacted by the perceived desirability of given neighborhood's school.\n\nWhile the curriculum in the district is fairly standardized, each of the elementary schools has a different teaching philosophy. The schools and their philosophy of education are:\n*Conant School. Named for Luther Conant who taught for 17 years in the school district, served on the School Committee, and was Town Moderator for 40 years. The school emphasizes the [[Whole language]] approach when teaching students to read. The Conant School has an [[English language learning and teaching|English as a Second Language]] (ESL) program.\n*Douglas School. Named for Carolyn T. Douglas who was a teacher and principal in the Acton schools from 1940 to 1967. The school emphasizes [[Phonics]] for learning to read. The Douglas School has an ESL program (English as a Second Language).\n*Gates School. Named for Paul P. Gates who was the school physician from 1948 to 1968. The school emphasizes Phonics for learning to read.\n*McCarthy-Towne School. Named for Julia McCarthy who taught at the South Acton School from 1906 to 1952 and Marion Towne who was a teacher in the primary and secondary schools in Acton from 1921 to 1959. McCarthy-Towne integrates language arts, math, social studies, science and art in the study of curriculum \"units.\" The school has an ESL (English as a Second Language) program and also includes two CASE (Concord Area Special Education) classrooms. McCarthy-Towne has a very active parent volunteer program. McCarthy-Towne School is housed in the Parker Damon Building (named for McCarthy-Towne's first principal, J. Parker Damon), which it shares with the Merriam School. At McCarthy-Towne, students generally call their teachers by their first names, a practice shared by Merriam.\n*Merriam School. Named for Florence A. Merriam who taught for 35 years in Acton. Merriam offers a project-based curriculum. At Merriam, teachers teach the same group of students for two years (i.e., a teacher will teach first grade one year, second grade the next and then wrap back to first). This practice is called \"looping\". Merriam School is housed in the Parker Damon Building which it shares with the McCarthy-Towne school. At Merriam as well as at McCarthy-Towne, students call their teachers by their first names.\n\n===Acton-Boxborough Junior High and High School===\n\n'''The Acton-Boxborough Regional School''' has a single Junior High School ([[Raymond J. Grey Junior High School]]) for grades 7 & 8 and a single High School ([[Acton-Boxborough Regional High School]]) for grades 9 through 12. The regional district accepts some students from other neighboring towns as 'choice' students if the school committee decides this is in the best interest of the district. Both the junior high and high school were enlarged and renovated in 2000\u20132005. Both buildings are located at the school district campus in Acton.\n\nCurrent enrollment at the Junior High is approximately 1,000 students while the High School has roughly 2,000 students. The High School was ranked as the 3rd best public school in the Greater Boston area (defined as within I-495) by Boston Magazine in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonmagazine.com/best-public-schools-boston-2014-top-50/|title=Best Public Schools in Boston 2014 \u2013 Top 50 Ranking - Boston Magazine|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140908202354/http://www.bostonmagazine.com/best-public-schools-boston-2014-top-50/|archivedate=2014-09-08}}</ref>\n\n==Cultural institutions==\n[[Image:ActonMemorialLibrary2.jpg|thumb|Acton Memorial Library]]\n\n===Libraries===\nActon has two public [[library|libraries]]: the Acton Memorial Library and the West Acton Citizens' Library. The Acton Memorial Library was given to the town of Acton by William Allan Wilde as a memorial to its [[American Civil War|Civil War]] veterans in 1890. The building was expanded in 1967, and a second major expansion was completed in 1999. There are also libraries in each of the elementary schools, the Junior High, and the High School. The Acton Historical Society owns the Jenks Library which contains historical maps, documents, photographs and drawings.\n\n===Museums===\n* [[The Discovery Museums]] are two separate [[science museum]]s located on the same site. The Children's Discovery Museum has exhibits suitable for younger children, while the Science Discovery Museum focuses on older children. The location is well guarded by Bessie, the large [[dinosaur]] statue and museum mascot, located in the front grounds of the facility.\n*Iron Work Farm: Settlement of South Acton; 'Iron Work Farm in Acton, Inc.' is a non-profit, historical corporation chartered in Massachusetts since 1964, that operates two historic houses: [[Jones Tavern]] and [[Faulkner House]]. Each house is open to the public on the last Sunday of the month from May to October. The facilities are also open as part of the local [[Patriots' Day]] holiday observance each April.\n*Hosmer House: This [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]-era home, which is owned and maintained by the Acton Historical Society, is typically open to the public on [[Patriots' Day]], September 27 ('Crown Resistance Day'), as well as May 27 and June 24, from 2 to 4 o'clock.\n\n===Theater===\nThough there are several [[theater]] groups in Acton, the two eldest are Theatre III and Open Door Theater. The multi award-winning Theatre III was founded in 1956 when three organizations (a local chorus, dance group, and dramatic troupe) combined to present a show. It produces several plays and musicals each season in the historical old church building on Central Street.\n\nOpen Door Theater is a [[community theater]] group which was founded to provide an inclusive theater experience. Open Door produces one large musical each year which features a large number of performers ranging in age from 9 to adult including people with special needs. They perform and rehearse in the Dragonfly Theatre, located inside the R. J. Grey Junior High School.\n\n===Traditions===\n[[File:4th of July 2015 in Acton.jpg|thumb|[[4th of July]] 2015 [[Fireworks]] in Acton]]\n\n* Each year on [[Patriots' Day]] (traditionally April 19; since 1969, observed on the 3rd Monday in April as part of a 3-day Patriots' Day weekend), the Acton Minutemen<ref>{{cite web |author=Steve Crosby |url=http://www.actonminutemen.org/index.html |title=Acton Minutemen home page |publisher=Actonminutemen.org |accessdate=2008-11-24 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306020006/http://www.actonminutemen.org/index.html |archivedate=2009-03-06 }}</ref> lead a march from Acton Center to the Old North Bridge in Concord.

The main part of the [[tavern]], originally home to the Jones family of South Acton, was built in 1732 as a house for Samuel Jones, Jr. By 1750 it had become a tavern and [[general store]]. It is speculated to be the first store in Acton and holds the distinction of being the town's longest established business, merging into James Tuttle's store in 1845 and operating under various names until 1950.\n* The Faulkner House and Mills.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ironworkfarm.org/jonestavern.htm |title=Jones Tavern |publisher=Ironworkfarm.org |accessdate=2008-11-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820071028/http://www.ironworkfarm.org/jonestavern.htm |archivedate=August 20, 2008 }}</ref> The house was built for Ephraim Jones (1679\u20131710), founder in 1702 of an early [[textile]] business and other mills that formed the nucleus of the present town of Acton. Ammi Ruhamah Faulkner rented the mills in 1738 and then purchased them in 1742. Six generations of Faulkners lived in the house over a 202-year period. The largest and most central house of this settlement, it served as the local garrison house for protection from Indian raids made along the Massachusetts frontier during [[Queen Anne's War]] of 1702\u20131713. The Faulkner homestead served as a [[garrison]] for South Acton Militia during the Revolutionary War.\n* Town Center: The civic center of town is marked by the Acton Monument which is the final resting place of Captain Isaac Davis, James Hayward and Abner Hosmer. The stone on which Captain Davis mortally fell is situated between the west side of the monument and Main Street. The main entrance to the Town Hall, around the rear of the building, contains Isaac Davis's plow which was used by Daniel Chester French for the statue he cast for North Bridge.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[Image:Acton Road Signs 1.jpg|thumb|Antique road sign in a well near Acton Center, along [[Massachusetts Route 27|Route 27]]]]\n\nActon is {{convert|5|mi|km|spell=in}} from [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|I-495]] and {{convert|10|mi|km|spell=in}} from [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|I-95]]/[[Route 128 (Massachusetts)|Route 128]].

The operation was launched based on intelligence provided by [[Major general]] [[Nguyen Chanh Thi]], the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) [[I Corps (South Vietnam)|I Corps]] commander. [[III Marine Expeditionary Force|III Marine Amphibious Force]] (III MAF) commander [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Lewis W. Walt]] devised a plan to launch a pre-emptive strike against the [[Viet Cong]] (VC) 1st Regiment to nullify their threat to the vital [[Chu Lai Air Base]] and [[Chu Lai Base Area|Base Area]] and ensure its powerful communication tower remained intact.\n\nThe operation was conducted as a [[combined arms]] assault involving ground, air and naval units. [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] were deployed by [[Air assault|helicopter insertion]] while an amphibious landing was used to deploy other Marines. The VC used a variety of tactics to counter the Marine assault, fighting from prepared positions and then withdrawing as the Marines gained local superiority and ambushing a lost supply column. The VC were unable to withstand the weight of the Marine assault and U.S. firepower losing 614 killed and nine captured for U.S. losses of 42 killed. \n\n==Background==\nThe United States had been providing material support to [[South Vietnam]] since its foundation in 1954. The [[Vietnam War]] effectively began with the start of the [[North Vietnam]]ese backed VC [[Guerrilla warfare|insurgency]] in 1959/60 and the U.S. increased its military aid and advisory support to South Vietnam in response.<ref name=Hastings>{{cite book|last=Hastings|first=Max|title=Vietnam: An Epic Tragedy, 1945-1975|publisher=Harper|year=2018|isbn=9780062405661}}</ref>{{rp|119-20}} With the worsening military and political situation in South Vietnam, the U.S. increasingly became directly involved in the conflict.<ref name=Hastings/>{{rp|131}} U.S. Marines were the first ground troops deployed to South Vietnam, landing at [[Da Nang]] on 8 March 1965.<ref name=Hastings/>{{rp|246-7}} In May the Marines and ARVN forces secured the [[Chu Lai]] area to establish a jet-capable airfield and base area.<ref name=Shulimson>{{cite book|last=Shulimson|first=Jack|title=U.S. Marines in Vietnam: The Landing and the Buildup|publisher=History and Museums Division, Headquarters, U.S. Marine Corps|year=1978|url=https://www.usmcu.edu/Portals/218/U_S_%20Marines%20in%20Vietnam_The%20Landing%20and%20the%20Buildup%201965%20%20PCN%2019000307600.pdf|isbn=978-1494287559}}{{PD-notice}}</ref>{{rp|29-35}}\n\nOn 30 July, [[COMUSMACV]] [[General (United States)|General]] [[William Westmoreland]] told III MAF commander General Walt that he expected him to undertake larger offensive operations with the South Vietnamese against the VC at greater distances from his base areas. Walt reminded Westmoreland that the Marines were still bound by the 6 May Letter of Instruction that restricted III MAF to reserve/reaction missions in support of South Vietnamese units heavily engaged with a VC force. Westmoreland replied \"these restraints were no longer realistic, and invited Walt to rewrite the instructions, working into them the authority he thought he needed, and promised his approval.\" On 6 August, General Walt received official permission to take the offensive against the VC. With the arrival of the [[7th Marine Regiment]] a week later, he prepared to move against the 1st VC Regiment.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|69}}\n\nIn early July, the 1st VC Regiment had launched a second attack against the hamlet of Ba Gia, {{convert|20|mi}} south of Chu Lai. The ARVN garrison was overrun, causing 130 casualties and the loss of more than 200 weapons, including two [[M101 howitzer|105 mm howitzers]]. After the attack on Ba Gia, US intelligence agencies located the 1st VC Regiment in the mountains west of the hamlet. Reports indicated that the regiment was once more on the march. Acting on this intelligence, the [[4th Marine Regiment]] conducted a one-battalion operation with the ARVN 51st Regiment, [[1st Division (South Vietnam)|1st Division]] in search of the 1st VC Regiment south of the [[Tr\u00e0 B\u1ed3ng River]]. Codenamed Thunderbolt, the operation lasted from 6 to 7 August, and extended 7km south of the river in an area west of [[National Route 1A (Vietnam)|Route 1]]. The ARVN and Marines found little sign of any major VC force in the area and encountered only scattered resistance.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|69}}\n\nEight days after Thunderbolt, the Allies finally confirmed the location of the 1st VC Regiment. On 15 August, a deserter from the regiment surrendered to the ARVN. During his interrogation at General Thi's headquarters he revealed that the regiment had established its base in the Van Tuong village complex on the coast, {{convert|12|mi}} south of Chu Lai and planned to attack Chu Lai. The prisoner told his interrogators that the 1st VC Regiment at Van Tuong consisted of two of its three battalions, the 60th and 80th, reinforced by the 52nd Company and a company from the 45th Weapons Battalion; approximately 1,500 men in all. Thi, who personally questioned the prisoner and believed the man was telling the truth, relayed the information to Walt. At about the same time, the III MAF intelligence section received corroborative information from another source. Convinced of the danger to the airfield, Walt's subordinates advised a spoiling attack in the Van Tuong region. Walt flew to Chu Lai and held a hurried council of war with his senior commanders there: [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier general]] [[Frederick J. Karch]], who had become the Chu Lai Coordinator on 5 August, [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] McClanahan of the 4th Marines and Colonel [[Oscar F. Peatross]], the newly arrived 7th Marines' commander. Walt then decided to proceed with an operation.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|70}}\n\n==Planning==\nIn a hectic two-day period, the III MAF, division, wing and 7th Marines staffs assembled forces and prepared plans for the attack. The concept for the operation dictated a two-battalion assault, one battalion to land across the beach and the other to land by helicopter further inland. The division reassigned two battalions previously under the operational control of the 4th Marines to Peatross as the assault battalions, [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] Fisher's [[2nd Battalion, 4th Marines]] and Lieutenant Colonel Joseph E. Muir's [[3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines]]. Walt, who wanted a third battalion as a floating reserve, requested permission to use the [[Amphibious ready group|Shore Landing Force]] (SLF) which [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[U. S. Grant Sharp Jr.]] approved immediately. At the time of the request the amphibious task force was located at [[Subic Bay Naval Base]], {{convert|720|mi}} away. Based upon its transit time to the operational area, the planners selected 18 August as D-Day. The operation was originally called Satellite, but a power blackout led to a clerk working by candlelight typing \"Starlite\" instead.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|70}}\n\nIn order to maintain the secrecy of the operation, none of the ARVN Joint General Staff were informed about the operation until after it had started. Only Generals Thi and ARVN [[2nd Division (South Vietnam)|2nd Division]] commander General [[Ho\u00e0ng Xu\u00e2n L\u00e3m]] had advance knowledge of the operation in order to keep ARVN forces out of the operational area.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|82-3}}\n\nPeatross and his commanders conducted an aerial surveillance of the area and selected the amphibious assault landing site, as well as the helicopter [[landing zone]]s (LZs). They chose the beach north of the coastal hamlet of An Cuong, later designated Green Beach, for the landing. A force there would block VC avenues of escape to the south. Three LZs, Red, White and Blue, were selected {{convert|4|mi}} east of Route 1 and roughly {{convert|1|mi}} inland from the coast. LZ Blue, about 2km west of Green Beach, was the southernmost of the LZs. White was 2km west northwest of Blue, while Red was 2km north of White. From these positions, the Marines were to move northeast to the South China Sea.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|71}}\n\nOn the morning of the 17th the plans were completed. 3/3 Marines was to land across Green Beach at 06:30, 18 August with Companies I and K abreast, K on the right. Company L, the battalion reserve, was to follow as the lead companies swerved to the northwest. The remaining company, Company M, was to make an overland movement from Chu Lai to a ridgeline blocking position in the northern portion of the operations area, {{convert|4|mi}} northwest of Green Beach and {{convert|1|mi}} inland from the sea, closing off the VCs' retreat. Soon after H-Hour, [[Sikorsky H-34|UH-34s]] from [[HMM-261]] and [[HMM-361]] were to shuttle the 2/4th Marines into the three LZs. The two battalions were to join forces when Company H from LZ Blue linked up with Company I outside the hamlet of An Cuong , 1.8km inland from Green Beach. From there, the Marines were to sweep to the sea through the Van Tuong village complex and over the Phuoc Thuan Peninsula. Artillery batteries at Chu Lai were to provide artillery support while two [[United States Navy]] destroyers, the {{USS|Orleck|DD-886|6}} and the {{USS|Prichett|DD-561|6}} and the cruiser {{USS|Galveston|CLG-3|6}} were available for [[naval gunfire support]]. Aircraft from [[Marine Aircraft Group 11]] and [[Marine Aircraft Group 12]] were to fly [[Close air support|close support]] for the operation.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|71-2}}\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Operation Starlite 18-19 August 1965.jpg|thumb|right|Operation Starlite 18-19 August 1965]]\nAt 10:00 on the 17th, Company M, 3/3 Marines boarded [[LVTP-5]]s at Chu Lai and moved along the coast to the Trung Phan Peninsula; then the company marched {{convert|4|mi}} south where it established its blocking position. The Marines of Company M met only minor resistance, an occasional sniper and booby traps. Before dawn on the 18th, the company reached its objective and dug in. Marine patrols had been active in this area for some time and to the casual observer the company's activity was just another small unit movement. At 17:00 on 17 August, the rest of 3/3rd Marines, with Colonel Peatross and his staff, embarked on the three ships of the amphibious task group, {{USS|Bayfield|APA-33|6}}, {{USS|Cabildo|LSD-16|6}} and {{USS|Vernon County|LST-1161|6}}. Three [[M67 Flame Thrower Tank]]s attached to the 7th Marines and a platoon of five [[M48 Patton|M48]] tanks assigned to Fisher's battalion boarded two [[Landing Craft Utility|LCUs]], which then sailed independently towards the amphibious objective area, timing their arrival to coincide with that of the troop transports. The task force first sailed east to deceive any VC in [[sampan]]s in the coastal waters. Once over the horizon, the ships changed course to the southwest, arriving in the amphibious objective area shortly after 05:00. There they were joined by the ''Galveston'' and the ''Orleck'', which were to cover the landing.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|72}}\n\nAt 06:15, 15 minutes before H-Hour, Battery K, [[4th Battalion, 12th Marines]], which had displaced to firing positions on the northern bank of the Tr\u00e0 B\u1ed3ng River the night before, began [[M114 155 mm howitzer|155 mm]] preparation fires of the helicopter landing zones. The artillery was soon reinforced by 20 Marine [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk|A-4s]] and [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F-4s]] which dropped 18 tons of bombs and [[napalm]] on the LZs. The Marines limited their preparation of Green Beach to 20mm cannon strafing runs by MAG-12 A-4s, because of the proximity of An Cuong to the landing site. As the air and artillery fires lifted, the ground forces arrived, Companies I and K, in LVTP-5s, landed across Green Beach at 06:30 and pushed inland according to plan. The troops quickly spread out and moved into An Cuong. After a futile search for VC, the company continued advancing to the west. Company K received sniper fire from its right as it crossed the northern portion of Green Beach. Two platoons quickly moved northward and the VC fire ceased. The third platoon secured the northern half of An Cuong. Fifteen minutes after H-Hour, Company G, 2/4th Marines landed at LZ Red. Company F and the command group landed at LZ White and Company H arrived at LZ Blue 45 minutes later. On the beach, Muir, who had moved his command post ashore, was joined at 07:30 by Peatross and his staff. Tanks and [[M50 Ontos]] rolled off the LCUs and [[landing craft mechanized]] (LCMs) and made their way forward to support the assault companies. Company L came ashore and established perimeter security for the supply area at the beach. Most of the Marine companies met only light resistance as they moved into the attack. Company G searched two hamlets in the vicinity of LZ Red and then advanced to the northeast and linked up with Company M without incident. At LZ White Company E encountered stiffer opposition from the VC. The VC manned firing positions on a ridgeline east and northeast of the LZ, employing mortars, machine guns, and small arms. After dogged fighting, the Marines cleared the hills. By midmorning, Company E began moving northeast. At one juncture, the Marines spotted about 100 VC in the open and asked for artillery fire. The 107mm Mortar (Howtar) Battery, [[3rd Battalion, 12th Marines]], helilifted into the position held by Company M, shelled the VC force killing an estimated 90 VC. Company E continued to push forward, finding only occasional opposition.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|72-3}}\n\nAlong the coast, Company K had advanced to Phase Line Banana, 2km north of Green Beach. There a VC force, entrenched on a hill overlooking the Marine positions, blocked the advance of the company. Muir, who had established his forward command post with Company K, ordered Company L forward. By midafternoon, the two Marine companies, aided by supporting arms, captured the high ground and set up night defenses. The major action developed in the south near LZ Blue, at the junction of 2/4th Marines and 3/3rd Marines. This area, roughly one square kilometer, was bound by the hamlets of An Thoi  on the north, Nam Yen on the south and An Cuong to the east. It was a patchwork of [[Paddy field|rice paddies]], streams, hedgerows, woods and built-up areas, interspersed by trails leading in all directions. Two small knolls dominated the flat terrain, Hill 43, a few hundred meters southwest of Nam Yen, and Hill 30, 400 meters north of An Cuong. LZ Blue was just south of Nam Yen, between Hill 43 and the hamlet. Company H's LZ was almost on top of the VC 60th Battalion. The VC allowed the first helicopters to touch down with little interference, but then opened fire as the others came in. Three U.S. Army [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|UH-1B gunships]] from the 7th Airlift Platoon, took the VC on Hill 43 under fire while Company H formed a defensive perimeter around the LZ.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|73-5}} The Company H commander, [[First Lieutenant]] Homer K. Jenkins, was not yet aware of the size of the VC force. He ordered one platoon to take the hill and the rest of the company to secure Nam Yen, both attacks soon stalled. The platoon attacking Hill 43 was still at the bottom of the hill when Jenkins called back his other two platoons from the outskirts of Nam Yen in order to regroup. He requested air strikes against both the VC hill position and Nam Yen and then renewed the attack, but this time, Jenkins moved all three of his platoons into the assault on the hill. The VC fought tenaciously, but the Marines, reinforced by close air support and tanks, were too strong. One Marine platoon counted six dead VC near a heavy machine gun position and more bodies scattered throughout the brush. Jenkins' men took one prisoner and collected over 40 weapons.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|73-5}} \n\nThe airstrikes called by Jenkins against VC positions at Nam Yen momentarily halted the advance of Company I, 3/3rd Marines at a streambed east of Nam Yen. Bomb fragments slightly wounded two Marines. After the bombing run, Company I moved north along the stream for 500 meters to a point opposite An Cuong. Under fire from An Cuong, An Thoi and Nam Yen, [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] Bruce D. Webb, the company commander, requested permission to attack An Cuong, although it was across the bank in the area of responsibility of the 2/4th Marines. Muir approved the request, after consulting with Peatross. An Cuong was a fortified hamlet, ideally suited to VC combat tactics. The area surrounding the hamlet was heavily wooded with severely restricted fields of fire. The only open areas were the rice paddies and even these were interspersed with hedgerows of hardwood and bamboo thickets. An Cuong itself consisted of 25-30 huts, with fighting holes and camouflaged trench lines connected by a system of interlocking tunnels. As the company cleared the first few huts, a grenade exploded, killing Webb and wounding three other Marines. No sooner had the grenade exploded, than two 60mm mortar rounds fell on the advancing troops, inflicting three more casualties. First Lieutenant Richard M. Purnell, the company executive officer, assumed command and committed the reserve platoon. The company gained the upper hand and the action slackened as the troops secured the hamlet. Making a hurried survey of the battlefield, Purnell counted 50 VC bodies. He then radioed his battalion commander for further instructions. Muir ordered Purnell's company to join Company K, which was heavily engaged at Phase Line Banana, 2km to the northeast. Company H remained near Nam Yen to clean out all VC opposition there and then planned to link up with Muir's battalion.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|75}} While Company I maneuvered through An Cuong Peatross committed one company of his reserve battalion to the battle. Company I, [[3rd Battalion, 7th Marines]] on {{USS|Iwo Jima|LPH-2|6}} were landed by [[HMM-163]] helicopters shortly after 09:30.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|77}} \n\nAs Company I was preparing to move from An Cuong, a UH-1E gunship from [[VMO-2]] was shot down by VC small arms fire northeast of the hamlet. Muir ordered Purnell to leave some men behind to protect the helicopter. Purnell ordered two squads and three tanks to stay with the helicopter until the craft was evacuated. As the company departed, its members could see that Jenkins' Company H had left Hill 43 and was advancing on the left flank of Company I. At 11:00 Jenkins led his unit, augmented by five tanks and three Ontos, from the Hill 43 area into the open rice paddy between Nam Yen and An Cuong. Jenkins bypassed Nam Yen as he mistakenly believed that Company I had cleared both hamlets. Suddenly, from positions in Nam Yen and from Hill 30, the VC opened up with small arms and machine gun fire, catching the Marine rearguard in a crossfire. Then mortar shells began bursting upon the lead platoons. Company H was taking fire from all directions, and tracked vehicles, Ontos and tanks, were having trouble with the muck of the paddies. Jenkins drew his armor into a tight circle and deployed his infantry. One squad moved to the northwest of Nam Yen and killed nine VC who were manning a mortar, but were driven off by small arms fire and had to withdraw to the relative security of the tanks. Jenkins saw that his position was untenable, and after radioing for supporting arms, he ordered his force to withdraw to LZ Blue. Artillery hit Nam Yen while F-4s and A-4s attacked Hill 30. About 14:00, the company tried to move back to the LZ. The lead platoon was forced to alter course when medical evacuation helicopters tried to land in the midst of the unit. As it maneuvered off to the flank of Company H, this platoon became separated from Jenkins' main body and was engaged by the VC. At this juncture, the platoon unexpectedly linked up with Purnell's helicopter security detail which had started to move toward its parent company after the downed helicopter had been repaired and flown out. The small force was quickly engaged by a VC unit, but together the two Marine units fought their way to An Cuong. Meanwhile, Jenkins and his other two platoons fought a delaying action and withdrew to LZ Blue, arriving there at 16:30. Fisher directed Jenkins to establish a defensive perimeter and await reinforcements.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|76}}\n\n[[File:Operationstarlite1965.jpg|thumb|right|A MAG-16 helicopter evacuates casualties, while a Marine [[M48 Patton]] tank stands guard]]\n\nThe expected reinforcements never arrived; they had been diverted to help a supply column that had been ambushed 400m west of An Cuong. Just before noon, Muir had ordered his executive officer in charge of the 3/3rd Marines rear command group, [[Major (United States)|Major]] Andrew G. Comer, to dispatch the mobile (LVT) resupply to Company I, which, at the time, was only a \"few hundred yards\" in front of the command group.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|76}} Five LVTP-5s and three flame tanks, the only tactical support available at the time, were briefed on the location of the company and marked the routes they were to follow on their maps. The supply column left the command post (CP) shortly after noon, but got lost between Nam Yen and An Thoi. It had followed a trail that was flanked on one side by a rice paddy and on the other by trees and hedgerows. As the two lead vehicles, a tank and an LVTP, went around a bend in the road, an explosion occurred near the tank, followed by another in the middle of the column. Fire from VC recoilless rifles and a barrage of mortar rounds tore into the column. The vehicles backed off the road and turned their weapons to face the VC. Using all of their weapons the troops held off the closing VC infantry. The rear tank tried to use its flamethrower, but a VC shell had rendered it useless. Throughout the fighting, the convoy was still able to maintain communications with the command post, radioing that the column was surrounded by VC and was about to be overrun. The LVT radio operator kept the microphone button depressed the entire time and pleaded for help. The command post was unable to quiet him sufficiently to gain essential information as to their location. This continued for an extended period, perhaps an hour. Informed of the ambush Muir replied that he was returning Company I to the rear CP and ordered Comer to gather whatever other support they could and to rescue them as rapidly as possible. Peatross, well aware of the vulnerable positions of both Company H and the supply column and fearing that the VC was attempting to drive a salient between the two battalions approved a rescue mission. The plan was to use a rapidly moving tank, LVTP and Ontos column through the previously cleared An Cuong area. Before the planning meeting broke up, one of the flame tanks which had been in the supply column arrived at the CP, the crew chief, a staff sergeant, reported that they had just passed through An Cuong without being fired upon and that he could lead them to the supply column.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|76}} \n\nShortly after 13:00, Comer's force moved out. Just after cresting Hill 30, the M-48 tank was hit by recoilless rifle fire and stopped short. The other vehicles immediately jammed together and simultaneously mortar and small arms fire saturated the area. Within a few minutes, the Marines suffered five dead and 17 wounded. The infantry quickly dismounted and the Ontos maneuvered to provide frontal fire and to protect the flanks while artillery fire and air support was called in. With the response of supporting arms, the VC fire diminished and Company I was ordered to resume its advance toward An Cuong leaving a small rear guard on Hill 30 to supervise the evacuation of the casualties. The company entered An Cuong against little resistance, but Comer's command group were caught by intense fire from a wooded area to their right front and forced to take what cover they could in the open rice paddies. At the same time, the Marines came upon the two reinforced squads from Company I which had been left to guard the downed Huey and the platoon from Company H. The two squads from Company I fought their way to Hill 30 where they were evacuated while the Company H platoon remained in the rice paddies.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|77}} \n\nAs the intensity of the battle increased, Peatross ordered a halt to the advance of the units from LZs Red and White and along the coast to prevent the overextension of his lines. Company L, 3/7th Marines arrived at the regimental CP at 17:30 and was placed under the operational control of Muir, who ordered them to reinforce Company I in the search for the supply column. Supported by two tanks, Company L moved out. As they advanced through the open rice paddies east of An Cuong, they came under heavy fire, wounding 14 and killing four. The Marines persevered and the VC broke contact as night fell. The addition of a third Marine company to the area, coupled with the weight of supporting arms fire available, evidently forced the VC 60th Battalion to break contact. The Marines radioed the ''Galveston'' and ''Orleck'' requesting continuous illumination throughout the evening over the Nam Yen-An Cuong area. As darkness fell, Peatross informed Walt that the VC apparently intended to defend selected positions, while not concentrating their forces. Muir decided that it was too risky to continue searching for the supply column that night, especially after having learned that the column, although immobilized, was no longer in danger. Muir ordered Company L to move to Phase Line Banana and join Companies K and L, and establish a perimeter defense there. He also ordered Company I to return to the regimental CP. For all intents and purposes, the fighting was over for Company I; of its 177 men who had crossed the beach, 14 were dead, including the company commander, and another 53 were wounded, but the company claimed 125 VC killed.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|77-8}}\n\nDuring the night of 18 August, Peatross brought the rest of the SLF battalion ashore. Company I, 3/7th Marines arrived at the regimental CP at 18:00, followed shortly by Lieutenant Colonel Charles R. Bodley and his command group. Just after midnight, Company M landed across Green Beach from the {{USS|Talladega|APA-208|6}}. With the arrival of his third battalion, Peatross completed his plans for the next day. The concept of action remained basically the same, squeeze the vice around the VC and drive them toward the sea. As a result of the first day's action against the VC 60th Battalion, he readjusted the battalions' boundaries. At 07:30, Muir's 3/3rd Marines, with Companies K and L abreast and Company L, 3/7th Marines following in reserve, was to attack to the northeast from Phase Line Banana. Simultaneously, Fisher's 2/4th Marines, with Companies E and G, was to drive eastward to the sea, joining 3/3rd Marines. Jenkins' Company H, Comer's group, and Company I were to withdraw to the regimental CP. The remainder of 3/7th Marines was to fill the gap. Companies I and M were to move out of the regimental CP, extract the ambushed supply column, and then move toward An Thoi to establish a blocking position there which would prevent the VC from slipping southward. Company M, 3/3rd Marines was to hold its blocking positions further north. The VC were to be left no avenue of escape.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|78-9}}\n\nOn the 19th, 3/7th Marines moved into its zone of action which included the area of the fiercest fighting of the day before, but the VC were gone. At 09:00, Companies I and M left the regimental CP, and moved through An Cuong, meeting no VC resistance. They brought out the supply column and by 15:00 had established their assigned blocking position at An Thoi. Although much of the VC resistance had disappeared, Fisher and Muir still found pockets of stiff opposition when they launched their combined attacks at 07:30. The terrain was very difficult as the rice paddies, ringed by dikes and hedgerows, hindered control, observation and maneuverability. The VC were holed up in bunkers, trenches, and caves which were scattered throughout the area. Marines would sweep through an area, only to have VC snipers fire upon them from the rear. In many cases, the Marines had to dig out the VC or blow up the tunnels. By 10:30, Company E had linked up with Company K and the two battalions continued their advance to the sea. By nightfall, the 2/4th Marines had completed its sweep of the Phuoc Thuan Peninsula. VC organized resistance had ceased.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|79}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nAlthough the cordon phase of Starlite had been completed, Walt decided to continue the operation for five more days so that the entire area could be searched systematically. He believed that some of the VC had remained behind in underground hiding places. 2/4th Marines and 3/3rd Marines returned to Chu Lai on the 20th and [[1st Battalion, 7th Marines]] moved into the objective area and joined 3/7th Marines and units from the ARVN 2nd Division for the search. The Marines killed 54 more VC in the Van Tuong complex before Starlite came to an end on 24 August. The Marines had killed 614 VC by body count, taken nine prisoners, held 42 suspects and collected 109 assorted weapons, at a cost of 45 Marines dead and 203 wounded.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|79-80}}\n\nCorporal [[Robert E. O'Malley]] (3/3 Marines) and Lance Corporal [[Joe C. Paul]] (2/4 Marines) received the [[Medal of Honor]] for their actions during the operation; Muir was awarded the [[Navy Cross]] for his actions during the operation.

The operation was launched based on intelligence provided by [[Major general]] [[Nguyen Chanh Thi]], the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) [[I Corps (South Vietnam)|I Corps]] commander. [[III Marine Expeditionary Force|III Marine Amphibious Force]] (III MAF) commander [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Lewis W. Walt]] devised a plan to launch a pre-emptive strike against the [[Viet Cong]] (VC) 1st Regiment to nullify their threat to the vital [[Chu Lai Air Base]] and [[Chu Lai Base Area|Base Area]] and ensure its powerful communication tower remained intact.\n\nThe operation was conducted as a [[combined arms]] assault involving ground, air and naval units. [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] were deployed by [[Air assault|helicopter insertion]] while an amphibious landing was used to deploy other Marines. The VC used a variety of tactics to counter the Marine assault, fighting from prepared positions and then withdrawing as the Marines gained local superiority and ambushing a lost supply column. The VC were unable to withstand the weight of the Marine assault and U.S. firepower losing 614 killed and nine captured for U.S. losses of 42 killed. \n\n==Background==\nThe United States had been providing material support to [[South Vietnam]] since its foundation in 1954. The [[Vietnam War]] effectively began with the start of the [[North Vietnam]]ese backed VC [[Guerrilla warfare|insurgency]] in 1959/60 and the U.S. increased its military aid and advisory support to South Vietnam in response.<ref name=Hastings>{{cite book|last=Hastings|first=Max|title=Vietnam: An Epic Tragedy, 1945-1975|publisher=Harper|year=2018|isbn=9780062405661}}</ref>{{rp|119-20}} With the worsening military and political situation in South Vietnam, the U.S. increasingly became directly involved in the conflict.<ref name=Hastings/>{{rp|131}} U.S. Marines were the first ground troops deployed to South Vietnam, landing at [[Danang]] on 8 March 1965.<ref name=Hastings/>{{rp|246-7}} In May the Marines and ARVN forces secured the Chu Lai area to establish a jet-capable airfield and base area.<ref name=Shulimson>{{cite book|last=Shulimson|first=Jack|title=U.S. Marines in Vietnam: The Landing and the Buildup|publisher=History and Museums Division, Headquarters, U.S. Marine Corps|year=1978|url=https://www.usmcu.edu/Portals/218/U_S_%20Marines%20in%20Vietnam_The%20Landing%20and%20the%20Buildup%201965%20%20PCN%2019000307600.pdf|isbn=978-1494287559}}{{PD-notice}}</ref>{{rp|29-35}}\n\nOn 30 July, [[COMUSMACV]] [[General (United States)|General]] [[William Westmoreland]] told III MAF commander General Walt that he expected him to undertake larger offensive operations with the South Vietnamese against the VC at greater distances from his base areas. Walt reminded Westmoreland that the Marines were still bound by the 6 May Letter of Instruction that restricted III MAF to reserve/reaction missions in support of South Vietnamese units heavily engaged with a VC force. Westmoreland replied \"these restraints were no longer realistic, and invited Walt to rewrite the instructions, working into them the authority he thought he needed, and promised his approval.\" On 6 August, General Walt received official permission to take the offensive against the VC. With the arrival of the [[7th Marine Regiment]] a week later, he prepared to move against the 1st VC Regiment.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|69}}\n\nIn early July, the 1st VC Regiment had launched a second attack against the hamlet of Ba Gia, {{convert|20|mi}} south of Chu Lai. The ARVN garrison was overrun, causing 130 casualties and the loss of more than 200 weapons, including two [[M101 howitzer|105 mm howitzers]]. After the attack on Ba Gia, US intelligence agencies located the 1st VC Regiment in the mountains west of the hamlet. Reports indicated that the regiment was once more on the march. Acting on this intelligence, the [[4th Marine Regiment]] conducted a one-battalion operation with the ARVN 51st Regiment, [[1st Division (South Vietnam)|1st Division]] in search of the 1st VC Regiment south of the [[Tr\u00e0 B\u1ed3ng River]]. Codenamed Thunderbolt, the operation lasted from 6 to 7 August, and extended 7km south of the river in an area west of [[National Route 1A (Vietnam)|Route 1]]. The ARVN and Marines found little sign of any major VC force in the area and encountered only scattered resistance.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|69}}\n\nEight days after Thunderbolt, the Allies finally confirmed the location of the 1st VC Regiment. On 15 August, a deserter from the regiment surrendered to the ARVN. During his interrogation at General Thi's headquarters he revealed that the regiment had established its base in the Van Tuong village complex on the coast, {{convert|12|mi}} south of Chu Lai and planned to attack Chu Lai. The prisoner told his interrogators that the 1st VC Regiment at Van Tuong consisted of two of its three battalions, the 60th and 80th, reinforced by the 52nd Company and a company from the 45th Weapons Battalion; approximately 1,500 men in all. Thi, who personally questioned the prisoner and believed the man was telling the truth, relayed the information to Walt. At about the same time, the III MAF intelligence section received corroborative information from another source. Convinced of the danger to the airfield, Walt's subordinates advised a spoiling attack in the Van Tuong region. Walt flew to Chu Lai and held a hurried council of war with his senior commanders there: [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier general]] [[Frederick J. Karch]], who had become the Chu Lai Coordinator on 5 August, [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] McClanahan of the 4th Marines and Colonel [[Oscar F. Peatross]], the newly arrived 7th Marines' commander. Walt then decided to proceed with an operation.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|70}}\n\n==Planning==\nIn a hectic two-day period, the III MAF, division, wing and 7th Marines staffs assembled forces and prepared plans for the attack. The concept for the operation dictated a two-battalion assault, one battalion to land across the beach and the other to land by helicopter further inland. The division reassigned two battalions previously under the operational control of the 4th Marines to Peatross as the assault battalions, [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] Fisher's [[2nd Battalion, 4th Marines]] and Lieutenant Colonel Joseph E. Muir's [[3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines]]. Walt, who wanted a third battalion as a floating reserve, requested permission to use the [[Amphibious ready group|Shore Landing Force]] (SLF) which [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[U. S. Grant Sharp Jr.]] approved immediately. At the time of the request the amphibious task force was located at [[Subic Bay Naval Base]], {{convert|720|mi}} away. Based upon its transit time to the operational area, the planners selected 18 August as D-Day. The operation was originally called Satellite, but a power blackout led to a clerk working by candlelight typing \"Starlite\" instead.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|70}}\n\nIn order to maintain the secrecy of the operation, none of the ARVN Joint General Staff were informed about the operation until after it had started. Only Generals Thi and ARVN [[2nd Division (South Vietnam)|2nd Division]] commander General [[Ho\u00e0ng Xu\u00e2n L\u00e3m]] had advance knowledge of the operation in order to keep ARVN forces out of the operational area.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|82-3}}\n\nPeatross and his commanders conducted an aerial surveillance of the area and selected the amphibious assault landing site, as well as the helicopter [[landing zone]]s (LZs). They chose the beach north of the coastal hamlet of An Cuong, later designated Green Beach, for the landing. A force there would block VC avenues of escape to the south. Three LZs, Red, White and Blue, were selected {{convert|4|mi}} east of Route 1 and roughly {{convert|1|mi}} inland from the coast. LZ Blue, about 2km west of Green Beach, was the southernmost of the LZs. White was 2km west northwest of Blue, while Red was 2km north of White. From these positions, the Marines were to move northeast to the South China Sea.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|71}}\n\nOn the morning of the 17th the plans were completed. 3/3 Marines was to land across Green Beach at 06:30, 18 August with Companies I and K abreast, K on the right. Company L, the battalion reserve, was to follow as the lead companies swerved to the northwest. The remaining company, Company M, was to make an overland movement from Chu Lai to a ridgeline blocking position in the northern portion of the operations area, {{convert|4|mi}} northwest of Green Beach and {{convert|1|mi}} inland from the sea, closing off the VCs' retreat. Soon after H-Hour, [[Sikorsky H-34|UH-34s]] from [[HMM-261]] and [[HMM-361]] were to shuttle the 2/4th Marines into the three LZs. The two battalions were to join forces when Company H from LZ Blue linked up with Company I outside the hamlet of An Cuong , 1.8km inland from Green Beach. From there, the Marines were to sweep to the sea through the Van Tuong village complex and over the Phuoc Thuan Peninsula. Artillery batteries at Chu Lai were to provide artillery support while two [[United States Navy]] destroyers, the {{USS|Orleck|DD-886|6}} and the {{USS|Prichett|DD-561|6}} and the cruiser {{USS|Galveston|CLG-3|6}} were available for [[naval gunfire support]]. Aircraft from [[Marine Aircraft Group 11]] and [[Marine Aircraft Group 12]] were to fly [[Close air support|close support]] for the operation.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|71-2}}\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Operation Starlite 18-19 August 1965.jpg|thumb|right|Operation Starlite 18-19 August 1965]]\nAt 10:00 on the 17th, Company M, 3/3 Marines boarded [[LVTP-5]]s at Chu Lai and moved along the coast to the Trung Phan Peninsula; then the company marched {{convert|4|mi}} south where it established its blocking position. The Marines of Company M met only minor resistance, an occasional sniper and booby traps. Before dawn on the 18th, the company reached its objective and dug in. Marine patrols had been active in this area for some time and to the casual observer the company's activity was just another small unit movement. At 17:00 on 17 August, the rest of 3/3rd Marines, with Colonel Peatross and his staff, embarked on the three ships of the amphibious task group, {{USS|Bayfield|APA-33|6}}, {{USS|Cabildo|LSD-16|6}} and {{USS|Vernon County|LST-1161|6}}. Three [[M67 Flame Thrower Tank]]s attached to the 7th Marines and a platoon of five [[M48 Patton|M48]] tanks assigned to Fisher's battalion boarded two [[Landing Craft Utility|LCUs]], which then sailed independently towards the amphibious objective area, timing their arrival to coincide with that of the troop transports. The task force first sailed east to deceive any VC in [[sampan]]s in the coastal waters. Once over the horizon, the ships changed course to the southwest, arriving in the amphibious objective area shortly after 05:00. There they were joined by the ''Galveston'' and the ''Orleck'', which were to cover the landing.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|72}}\n\nAt 06:15, 15 minutes before H-Hour, Battery K, [[4th Battalion, 12th Marines]], which had displaced to firing positions on the northern bank of the Tr\u00e0 B\u1ed3ng River the night before, began [[M114 155 mm howitzer|155 mm]] preparation fires of the helicopter landing zones. The artillery was soon reinforced by 20 Marine [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk|A-4s]] and [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F-4s]] which dropped 18 tons of bombs and [[napalm]] on the LZs. The Marines limited their preparation of Green Beach to 20mm cannon strafing runs by MAG-12 A-4s, because of the proximity of An Cuong to the landing site. As the air and artillery fires lifted, the ground forces arrived, Companies I and K, in LVTP-5s, landed across Green Beach at 06:30 and pushed inland according to plan. The troops quickly spread out and moved into An Cuong. After a futile search for VC, the company continued advancing to the west. Company K received sniper fire from its right as it crossed the northern portion of Green Beach. Two platoons quickly moved northward and the VC fire ceased. The third platoon secured the northern half of An Cuong. Fifteen minutes after H-Hour, Company G, 2/4th Marines landed at LZ Red. Company F and the command group landed at LZ White and Company H arrived at LZ Blue 45 minutes later. On the beach, Muir, who had moved his command post ashore, was joined at 07:30 by Peatross and his staff. Tanks and [[M50 Ontos]] rolled off the LCUs and [[landing craft mechanized]] (LCMs) and made their way forward to support the assault companies. Company L came ashore and established perimeter security for the supply area at the beach. Most of the Marine companies met only light resistance as they moved into the attack. Company G searched two hamlets in the vicinity of LZ Red and then advanced to the northeast and linked up with Company M without incident. At LZ White Company E encountered stiffer opposition from the VC. The VC manned firing positions on a ridgeline east and northeast of the LZ, employing mortars, machine guns, and small arms. After dogged fighting, the Marines cleared the hills. By midmorning, Company E began moving northeast. At one juncture, the Marines spotted about 100 VC in the open and asked for artillery fire. The 107mm Mortar (Howtar) Battery, [[3rd Battalion, 12th Marines]], helilifted into the position held by Company M, shelled the VC force killing an estimated 90 VC. Company E continued to push forward, finding only occasional opposition.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|72-3}}\n\nAlong the coast, Company K had advanced to Phase Line Banana, 2km north of Green Beach. There a VC force, entrenched on a hill overlooking the Marine positions, blocked the advance of the company. Muir, who had established his forward command post with Company K, ordered Company L forward. By midafternoon, the two Marine companies, aided by supporting arms, captured the high ground and set up night defenses. The major action developed in the south near LZ Blue, at the junction of 2/4th Marines and 3/3rd Marines. This area, roughly one square kilometer, was bound by the hamlets of An Thoi  on the north, Nam Yen on the south and An Cuong to the east. It was a patchwork of [[Paddy field|rice paddies]], streams, hedgerows, woods and built-up areas, interspersed by trails leading in all directions. Two small knolls dominated the flat terrain, Hill 43, a few hundred meters southwest of Nam Yen, and Hill 30, 400 meters north of An Cuong. LZ Blue was just south of Nam Yen, between Hill 43 and the hamlet. Company H's LZ was almost on top of the VC 60th Battalion. The VC allowed the first helicopters to touch down with little interference, but then opened fire as the others came in. Three U.S. Army [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|UH-1B gunships]] from the 7th Airlift Platoon, took the VC on Hill 43 under fire while Company H formed a defensive perimeter around the LZ.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|73-5}} The Company H commander, [[First Lieutenant]] Homer K. Jenkins, was not yet aware of the size of the VC force. He ordered one platoon to take the hill and the rest of the company to secure Nam Yen, both attacks soon stalled. The platoon attacking Hill 43 was still at the bottom of the hill when Jenkins called back his other two platoons from the outskirts of Nam Yen in order to regroup. He requested air strikes against both the VC hill position and Nam Yen and then renewed the attack, but this time, Jenkins moved all three of his platoons into the assault on the hill. The VC fought tenaciously, but the Marines, reinforced by close air support and tanks, were too strong. One Marine platoon counted six dead VC near a heavy machine gun position and more bodies scattered throughout the brush. Jenkins' men took one prisoner and collected over 40 weapons.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|73-5}} \n\nThe airstrikes called by Jenkins against VC positions at Nam Yen momentarily halted the advance of Company I, 3/3rd Marines at a streambed east of Nam Yen. Bomb fragments slightly wounded two Marines. After the bombing run, Company I moved north along the stream for 500 meters to a point opposite An Cuong. Under fire from An Cuong, An Thoi and Nam Yen, [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] Bruce D. Webb, the company commander, requested permission to attack An Cuong, although it was across the bank in the area of responsibility of the 2/4th Marines. Muir approved the request, after consulting with Peatross. An Cuong was a fortified hamlet, ideally suited to VC combat tactics. The area surrounding the hamlet was heavily wooded with severely restricted fields of fire. The only open areas were the rice paddies and even these were interspersed with hedgerows of hardwood and bamboo thickets. An Cuong itself consisted of 25-30 huts, with fighting holes and camouflaged trench lines connected by a system of interlocking tunnels. As the company cleared the first few huts, a grenade exploded, killing Webb and wounding three other Marines. No sooner had the grenade exploded, than two 60mm mortar rounds fell on the advancing troops, inflicting three more casualties. First Lieutenant Richard M. Purnell, the company executive officer, assumed command and committed the reserve platoon. The company gained the upper hand and the action slackened as the troops secured the hamlet. Making a hurried survey of the battlefield, Purnell counted 50 VC bodies. He then radioed his battalion commander for further instructions. Muir ordered Purnell's company to join Company K, which was heavily engaged at Phase Line Banana, 2km to the northeast. Company H remained near Nam Yen to clean out all VC opposition there and then planned to link up with Muir's battalion.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|75}} While Company I maneuvered through An Cuong Peatross committed one company of his reserve battalion to the battle. Company I, [[3rd Battalion, 7th Marines]] on {{USS|Iwo Jima|LPH-2|6}} were landed by [[HMM-163]] helicopters shortly after 09:30.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|77}} \n\nAs Company I was preparing to move from An Cuong, a UH-1E gunship from [[VMO-2]] was shot down by VC small arms fire northeast of the hamlet. Muir ordered Purnell to leave some men behind to protect the helicopter. Purnell ordered two squads and three tanks to stay with the helicopter until the craft was evacuated. As the company departed, its members could see that Jenkins' Company H had left Hill 43 and was advancing on the left flank of Company I. At 11:00 Jenkins led his unit, augmented by five tanks and three Ontos, from the Hill 43 area into the open rice paddy between Nam Yen and An Cuong. Jenkins bypassed Nam Yen as he mistakenly believed that Company I had cleared both hamlets. Suddenly, from positions in Nam Yen and from Hill 30, the VC opened up with small arms and machine gun fire, catching the Marine rearguard in a crossfire. Then mortar shells began bursting upon the lead platoons. Company H was taking fire from all directions, and tracked vehicles, Ontos and tanks, were having trouble with the muck of the paddies. Jenkins drew his armor into a tight circle and deployed his infantry. One squad moved to the northwest of Nam Yen and killed nine VC who were manning a mortar, but were driven off by small arms fire and had to withdraw to the relative security of the tanks. Jenkins saw that his position was untenable, and after radioing for supporting arms, he ordered his force to withdraw to LZ Blue. Artillery hit Nam Yen while F-4s and A-4s attacked Hill 30. About 14:00, the company tried to move back to the LZ. The lead platoon was forced to alter course when medical evacuation helicopters tried to land in the midst of the unit. As it maneuvered off to the flank of Company H, this platoon became separated from Jenkins' main body and was engaged by the VC. At this juncture, the platoon unexpectedly linked up with Purnell's helicopter security detail which had started to move toward its parent company after the downed helicopter had been repaired and flown out. The small force was quickly engaged by a VC unit, but together the two Marine units fought their way to An Cuong. Meanwhile, Jenkins and his other two platoons fought a delaying action and withdrew to LZ Blue, arriving there at 16:30. Fisher directed Jenkins to establish a defensive perimeter and await reinforcements.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|76}}\n\n[[File:Operationstarlite1965.jpg|thumb|right|A MAG-16 helicopter evacuates casualties, while a Marine [[M48 Patton]] tank stands guard]]\n\nThe expected reinforcements never arrived; they had been diverted to help a supply column that had been ambushed 400m west of An Cuong. Just before noon, Muir had ordered his executive officer in charge of the 3/3rd Marines rear command group, [[Major (United States)|Major]] Andrew G. Comer, to dispatch the mobile (LVT) resupply to Company I, which, at the time, was only a \"few hundred yards\" in front of the command group.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|76}} Five LVTP-5s and three flame tanks, the only tactical support available at the time, were briefed on the location of the company and marked the routes they were to follow on their maps. The supply column left the command post (CP) shortly after noon, but got lost between Nam Yen and An Thoi. It had followed a trail that was flanked on one side by a rice paddy and on the other by trees and hedgerows. As the two lead vehicles, a tank and an LVTP, went around a bend in the road, an explosion occurred near the tank, followed by another in the middle of the column. Fire from VC recoilless rifles and a barrage of mortar rounds tore into the column. The vehicles backed off the road and turned their weapons to face the VC. Using all of their weapons the troops held off the closing VC infantry. The rear tank tried to use its flamethrower, but a VC shell had rendered it useless. Throughout the fighting, the convoy was still able to maintain communications with the command post, radioing that the column was surrounded by VC and was about to be overrun. The LVT radio operator kept the microphone button depressed the entire time and pleaded for help. The command post was unable to quiet him sufficiently to gain essential information as to their location. This continued for an extended period, perhaps an hour. Informed of the ambush Muir replied that he was returning Company I to the rear CP and ordered Comer to gather whatever other support they could and to rescue them as rapidly as possible. Peatross, well aware of the vulnerable positions of both Company H and the supply column and fearing that the VC was attempting to drive a salient between the two battalions approved a rescue mission. The plan was to use a rapidly moving tank, LVTP and Ontos column through the previously cleared An Cuong area. Before the planning meeting broke up, one of the flame tanks which had been in the supply column arrived at the CP, the crew chief, a staff sergeant, reported that they had just passed through An Cuong without being fired upon and that he could lead them to the supply column.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|76}} \n\nShortly after 13:00, Comer's force moved out. Just after cresting Hill 30, the M-48 tank was hit by recoilless rifle fire and stopped short. The other vehicles immediately jammed together and simultaneously mortar and small arms fire saturated the area. Within a few minutes, the Marines suffered five dead and 17 wounded. The infantry quickly dismounted and the Ontos maneuvered to provide frontal fire and to protect the flanks while artillery fire and air support was called in. With the response of supporting arms, the VC fire diminished and Company I was ordered to resume its advance toward An Cuong leaving a small rear guard on Hill 30 to supervise the evacuation of the casualties. The company entered An Cuong against little resistance, but Comer's command group were caught by intense fire from a wooded area to their right front and forced to take what cover they could in the open rice paddies. At the same time, the Marines came upon the two reinforced squads from Company I which had been left to guard the downed Huey and the platoon from Company H. The two squads from Company I fought their way to Hill 30 where they were evacuated while the Company H platoon remained in the rice paddies.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|77}} \n\nAs the intensity of the battle increased, Peatross ordered a halt to the advance of the units from LZs Red and White and along the coast to prevent the overextension of his lines. Company L, 3/7th Marines arrived at the regimental CP at 17:30 and was placed under the operational control of Muir, who ordered them to reinforce Company I in the search for the supply column. Supported by two tanks, Company L moved out. As they advanced through the open rice paddies east of An Cuong, they came under heavy fire, wounding 14 and killing four. The Marines persevered and the VC broke contact as night fell. The addition of a third Marine company to the area, coupled with the weight of supporting arms fire available, evidently forced the VC 60th Battalion to break contact. The Marines radioed the ''Galveston'' and ''Orleck'' requesting continuous illumination throughout the evening over the Nam Yen-An Cuong area. As darkness fell, Peatross informed Walt that the VC apparently intended to defend selected positions, while not concentrating their forces. Muir decided that it was too risky to continue searching for the supply column that night, especially after having learned that the column, although immobilized, was no longer in danger. Muir ordered Company L to move to Phase Line Banana and join Companies K and L, and establish a perimeter defense there. He also ordered Company I to return to the regimental CP. For all intents and purposes, the fighting was over for Company I; of its 177 men who had crossed the beach, 14 were dead, including the company commander, and another 53 were wounded, but the company claimed 125 VC killed.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|77-8}}\n\nDuring the night of 18 August, Peatross brought the rest of the SLF battalion ashore. Company I, 3/7th Marines arrived at the regimental CP at 18:00, followed shortly by Lieutenant Colonel Charles R. Bodley and his command group. Just after midnight, Company M landed across Green Beach from the {{USS|Talladega|APA-208|6}}. With the arrival of his third battalion, Peatross completed his plans for the next day. The concept of action remained basically the same, squeeze the vice around the VC and drive them toward the sea. As a result of the first day's action against the VC 60th Battalion, he readjusted the battalions' boundaries. At 07:30, Muir's 3/3rd Marines, with Companies K and L abreast and Company L, 3/7th Marines following in reserve, was to attack to the northeast from Phase Line Banana. Simultaneously, Fisher's 2/4th Marines, with Companies E and G, was to drive eastward to the sea, joining 3/3rd Marines. Jenkins' Company H, Comer's group, and Company I were to withdraw to the regimental CP. The remainder of 3/7th Marines was to fill the gap. Companies I and M were to move out of the regimental CP, extract the ambushed supply column, and then move toward An Thoi to establish a blocking position there which would prevent the VC from slipping southward. Company M, 3/3rd Marines was to hold its blocking positions further north. The VC were to be left no avenue of escape.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|78-9}}\n\nOn the 19th, 3/7th Marines moved into its zone of action which included the area of the fiercest fighting of the day before, but the VC were gone. At 09:00, Companies I and M left the regimental CP, and moved through An Cuong, meeting no VC resistance. They brought out the supply column and by 15:00 had established their assigned blocking position at An Thoi. Although much of the VC resistance had disappeared, Fisher and Muir still found pockets of stiff opposition when they launched their combined attacks at 07:30. The terrain was very difficult as the rice paddies, ringed by dikes and hedgerows, hindered control, observation and maneuverability. The VC were holed up in bunkers, trenches, and caves which were scattered throughout the area. Marines would sweep through an area, only to have VC snipers fire upon them from the rear. In many cases, the Marines had to dig out the VC or blow up the tunnels. By 10:30, Company E had linked up with Company K and the two battalions continued their advance to the sea. By nightfall, the 2/4th Marines had completed its sweep of the Phuoc Thuan Peninsula. VC organized resistance had ceased.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|79}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nAlthough the cordon phase of Starlite had been completed, Walt decided to continue the operation for five more days so that the entire area could be searched systematically. He believed that some of the VC had remained behind in underground hiding places. 2/4th Marines and 3/3rd Marines returned to Chu Lai on the 20th and [[1st Battalion, 7th Marines]] moved into the objective area and joined 3/7th Marines and units from the ARVN 2nd Division for the search. The Marines killed 54 more VC in the Van Tuong complex before Starlite came to an end on 24 August. The Marines had killed 614 VC by body count, taken nine prisoners, held 42 suspects and collected 109 assorted weapons, at a cost of 45 Marines dead and 203 wounded.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|79-80}}\n\nCorporal [[Robert E. O'Malley]] (3/3 Marines) and Lance Corporal [[Joe C. Paul]] (2/4 Marines) received the [[Medal of Honor]] for their actions during the operation; Muir was awarded the [[Navy Cross]] for his actions during the operation. Purnell (3/3 Marines) received the [[Silver Star]] for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action.<ref>Richard Purnell, [http://valor.militarytimes.com/recipient.php?recipientid=23799], \"Military Times\", August 18, 1965</ref> To the Americans, the battle was considered a great success for U.S. forces as they had engaged a local force VC unit and come out victorious. The VC also claimed victory, announcing that they had inflicted 900 American casualties (killed and wounded), destroyed 22 tanks and APCs and downed 13 helicopters, while suffering 200-300 casualties before withdrawing.<ref>Nguyen Ngoc Toan, [http://en.qdnd.vn/70-years-of-the-vietnam-peoples-army/van-tuong-victory-raises-confidence-in-defeating-us-troops/337654.html \"Van Tuong victory raises confidence in defeating US troops\"], ''People's Army Newspaper'', 21 December 2014.</ref>\n\nThe ambush of the Marine supply column was reported by journalist [[Peter Arnett]] and proved an embarrassment to the [[Lyndon B.
