It took place in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]], following [[Sandie Shaw]]'s win at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1967|1967 contest]] in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], with the song \"[[Puppet on a String]]\". It was the third time the event took place in the UK; after the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1960|1960]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest 1963|1963]] editions, both of which also took place in London. The contest was held at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] on Saturday 6 April 1968, and was hosted by [[Katie Boyle]] (for the third time). Seventeen countries participated in the contest.\n\nThe winner was [[Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest 1968|Spain]] with the song \"[[La, la, la]]\", performed by [[Massiel]], and written/composed by [[D\u00fao Din\u00e1mico|Manuel de la Calva]] and [[D\u00fao Din\u00e1mico|Ram\u00f3n Arcusa]]. This was Spain's first victory - and their first ever top five placing - in the contest. This was also first victory for the country from the [[Iberian Peninsula]].\n\nPrior to the contest, the United Kingdom's entry, [[Cliff Richard]] with the song \"[[Congratulations (Cliff Richard song)|Congratulations]]\", was hotly tipped as the favourite to win, but lost out to Spain's Massiel by a margin of just one point.\nOriginally Spain entered [[Joan Manuel Serrat]] to sing \"La La La\", but his demand to sing in [[Catalan language|Catalan]] was an affront to the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist State dictatorship]]. Serrat was replaced by Massiel, who sang the same song in [[Spanish language|Spanish]].<ref name=ESC1968>{{cite web|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1968|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=285|publisher=[[EBU]]|accessdate=16 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Location ==\n[[File:Royal Albert Hall, London - Nov 2012.jpg|thumb|left|Royal Albert Hall, London - host venue of the 1968 contest.]]\nThe contest was held at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in [[London]]. The Royal Albert Hall is known for hosting the world's leading artists from several performance genres, sports, award ceremonies, the annual summer [[Proms]] concerts and other events since its opening in 1871, and has become one of the United Kingdom's most treasured and distinctive buildings.\n\n== Format ==\n1968 was the first time that the Eurovision Song Contest was broadcast in colour. The countries that broadcast it in colour were France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, Sweden and the United Kingdom, although in the UK it was broadcast as an encore presentation in colour on [[BBC Two]] the next day.  Also all of Eastern Europe and Tunisia broadcast the contest.  Katie Boyle hosted the contest for a third time.<ref name=ESC1968/>\n\n==Vote rigging allegations==\nIn May 2008, a documentary by Spanish film-maker Montse Fern\u00e1ndez Villa, ''1968.

It took place in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]], following [[Sandie Shaw]]'s win at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1967|1967 contest]] in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]] with the song \"[[Puppet on a String]]\". It was the third time the event took place in the UK; after the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1960|1960]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest 1963|1963]] editions, both of which also took place in London. The contest was held at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] on Saturday 6 April 1968, and was hosted by [[Katie Boyle]] (for the third time). Seventeen countries participated in the contest.\n\nThe winner was [[Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest 1968|Spain]] with the song \"[[La, la, la]]\", performed by [[Massiel]], and written/composed by [[D\u00fao Din\u00e1mico|Manuel de la Calva]] and [[D\u00fao Din\u00e1mico|Ram\u00f3n Arcusa]]. This was Spain's first victory - and their first ever top five placing - in the contest. This was also first victory for the country from the [[Iberian Peninsula]].\n\nPrior to the contest, the United Kingdom's entry, [[Cliff Richard]] with the song \"[[Congratulations (Cliff Richard song)|Congratulations]]\", was hotly tipped as the favourite to win, but lost out to Spain's Massiel by a margin of just one point.\nOriginally Spain entered [[Joan Manuel Serrat]] to sing \"La La La\", but his demand to sing in [[Catalan language|Catalan]] was an affront to the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist State dictatorship]]. Serrat was replaced by Massiel, who sang the same song in [[Spanish language|Spanish]].<ref name=ESC1968>{{cite web|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1968|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=285|publisher=[[EBU]]|accessdate=16 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Location ==\n[[File:Royal Albert Hall, London - Nov 2012.jpg|thumb|left|Royal Albert Hall, London - host venue of the 1968 contest.]]\nThe contest was held at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in [[London]]. The Royal Albert Hall is known for hosting the world's leading artists from several performance genres, sports, award ceremonies, the annual summer [[Proms]] concerts and other events since its opening in 1871, and has become one of the United Kingdom's most treasured and distinctive buildings.\n\n== Format ==\n1968 was the first time that the Eurovision Song Contest was broadcast in colour. The countries that broadcast it in colour were France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, Sweden and the United Kingdom, although in the UK it was broadcast as an encore presentation in colour on [[BBC Two]] the next day.  Also all of Eastern Europe and Tunisia broadcast the contest.  Katie Boyle hosted the contest for a third time.<ref name=ESC1968/>\n\n==Vote rigging allegations==\nIn May 2008, a documentary by Spanish film-maker Montse Fern\u00e1ndez Villa, ''1968.

The franchise follows [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]], an [[anthropomorphic]] blue hedgehog who battles the evil [[Doctor Eggman]], a [[mad scientist]]. The main ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' games are [[platformer]]s mostly developed by [[Sonic Team]]; other games, developed by various studios, include [[Spin-off (media)|spin-offs]] in the [[racing video game|racing]], [[fighting game|fighting]], [[party game|party]] and [[sports game|sports]] genres. The franchise also incorporates [[List of Sonic the Hedgehog printed media|printed media]], [[List of Sonic the Hedgehog features|animations]], a [[Sonic the Hedgehog (film)|2020 feature film]], and merchandise.\n\nThe [[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|first ''Sonic'' game]], released in 1991 for the [[Sega Genesis]], was developed after Sega requested a mascot character to compete with [[Nintendo]]'s mascot [[Mario]]. Its success helped Sega become one of the leading video game companies during the [[16-bit era]] of the early 1990s. [[Sega Technical Institute]] developed the next three ''Sonic'' games in addition to ''[[Sonic Spinball]]'' (1993). After a hiatus during the unsuccessful [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]] era, the first major 3D ''Sonic'' game, ''[[Sonic Adventure]]'', was released in 1998 for the [[Dreamcast]]. Sega exited the console market and shifted to [[third-party development]] in 2001, continuing the series on Nintendo, [[Xbox]], and [[PlayStation]] systems.\n\nWhile ''Sonic'' games often have unique [[game mechanics]] and stories, they feature recurring elements such as the ring-based [[Health (game terminology)|health]] system, locations, and speedy gameplay. Games typically feature Sonic setting out to stop Eggman's schemes for world domination, and the player navigates [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] that include springs, slopes, bottomless pits, and [[vertical loop]]s. While Sonic and Eggman were the only characters introduced in the first game, the series would go on to have a [[List of Sonic the Hedgehog characters|large cast of characters]]; some, such as [[Miles \"Tails\" Prower]], [[Knuckles the Echidna]], and [[Shadow the Hedgehog]], starred in self-titled spin-offs. The franchise has also been represented in [[Crossover (fiction)|crossovers]] such as ''[[Sega All-Stars (series)|Sega All-Stars]]'' and Nintendo's ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series.\n\n''Sonic the Hedgehog'' is Sega's flagship franchise and one of the [[bestselling video game franchises]], selling 89{{nbsp}}million by March 2011 and grossing over {{US$|5 billion|long=no}} by 2014. Series sales and [[free-to-play]] [[mobile game]] downloads totaled 920{{nbsp}}million by 2019. The Genesis ''Sonic'' games have been described as representative of the [[culture of the 1990s]] and listed among the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest of all time]]. Although later games have been criticized for a perceived decline in quality compared to earlier installments, ''Sonic'' is influential in the video game industry and is frequently referenced in popular culture.\n\n=={{anchor|Video games|History}}Development==\n<!-- This Anchor tag serves to provide a permanent target for incoming section links.

The franchise follows [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]], an [[anthropomorphic]] blue hedgehog who battles the evil [[Doctor Eggman]], a [[mad scientist]]. The main ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' games are [[platformer]]s mostly developed by [[Sonic Team]]; other games, developed by various studios, include [[Spin-off (media)|spin-offs]] in the [[racing video game|racing]], [[fighting game|fighting]], [[party game|party]] and [[sports game|sports]] genres. The franchise also incorporates [[List of Sonic the Hedgehog printed media|printed media]], [[List of Sonic the Hedgehog features|animations]], a [[Sonic the Hedgehog (film)|2020 feature film]], and merchandise.\n\nThe [[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|first ''Sonic'' game]], released in 1991 for the [[Sega Genesis]], was developed after Sega requested a mascot character to compete with [[Nintendo]]'s mascot [[Mario]]. Its success helped Sega become one of the leading video game companies during the [[16-bit era]] of the early 1990s. [[Sega Technical Institute]] developed the next three ''Sonic'' games in addition to ''[[Sonic Spinball]]'' (1993). After a hiatus during the unsuccessful [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]] era, the first major 3D ''Sonic'' game, ''[[Sonic Adventure]]'', was released in 1998 for the [[Dreamcast]]. Sega exited the console market and shifted to [[third-party development]] in 2001, continuing the series on Nintendo, [[Xbox]], and [[PlayStation]] systems.\n\nWhile ''Sonic'' games often have unique [[game mechanics]] and stories, they feature recurring elements such as the ring-based [[Health (game terminology)|health]] system, locations, and speedy gameplay. Games typically feature Sonic setting out to stop Eggman's schemes for world domination, and the player navigates [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] that include springs, slopes, bottomless pits, and [[vertical loop]]s. While Sonic and Eggman were the only characters introduced in the first game, the series would go on to have a [[List of Sonic the Hedgehog characters|large cast of characters]]; some, such as [[Miles \"Tails\" Prower]], [[Knuckles the Echidna]], and [[Shadow the Hedgehog]], starred in self-titled spin-offs. The franchise has also been represented in [[Crossover (fiction)|crossovers]] such as ''[[Sega All-Stars (series)|Sega All-Stars]]'' and Nintendo's ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series.\n\n''Sonic the Hedgehog'' is Sega's flagship franchise and one of the [[bestselling video game franchises]], selling 89{{nbsp}}million by March 2011 and grossing over {{US$|5 billion|long=no}} by 2014. Series sales and [[free-to-play]] [[mobile game]] downloads totaled 920{{nbsp}}million by 2019. The Genesis ''Sonic'' games have been described as representative of the [[culture of the 1990s]] and listed among the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest of all time]]. Although later games have been criticized for a perceived decline in quality compared to earlier installments, ''Sonic'' is influential in the video game industry and is frequently referenced in popular culture.\n\n=={{anchor|Video games|History}}Development==\n<!-- This Anchor tag serves to provide a permanent target for incoming section links.
