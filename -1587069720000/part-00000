The film features [[Ram Charan]], [[Shruti Haasan]] and [[Amy Jackson]] in the lead roles, while [[Sai Kumar (Tollywood actor)|Sai Kumar]], [[Jayasudha]], [[Brahmanandam]] and [[Rahul Dev]] play supporting roles. It also featured [[Allu Arjun]] and [[Kajal Aggarwal]] in cameo roles. The film was produced by [[Dil Raju]] under the banner [[Sri Venkateswara Creations]]. [[Vakkantham Vamsi]] co-wrote the film's script with Paidipally. [[Devi Sri Prasad]] composed the film's music, while [[Marthand K. Venkatesh]] was the film's editor.\n\n''Yevadu'''s story was partially inspired by [[John Woo]]'s 1997 film, ''[[Face/Off]]'', and revolves around two strangers, Satya and Charan. It was made on a budget of {{INR}}350 million, and was officially launched on 9 December 2011. [[Principal photography]] began on 27 April 2012 and lasted until 22 July 2013. The majority of the film was shot in [[Visakhapatnam]] and [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], mostly in [[Ramoji Film City]], while two songs were shot in Switzerland and [[Bangkok]].\n\nReleased during the season of the [[Makar Sankranti]] festival, the film received decent feedback from critics. It grossed more than {{INR}}600&nbsp;million and collected a distributor share of {{INR}}471&nbsp;million, becoming one of the highest grossing Telugu films of 2014. The film was dubbed into [[Tamil language|Tamil]] as ''Magadheera'' and in [[Malayalam]] as ''Bhaiyya My Brother''.\n\n== Plot ==\nSatya ([[Allu_Arjun|Allu Arjun]]) and Deepthi ([[Kajal Aggarwal]]) are lovers living in Visakhapatnam. A dreaded don, Veeru Bhai ([[Rahul Dev]]), lusts for Deepthi. When Deepthi's parents are killed, she and Satya escape. They board a bus on route to Hyderabad, but the bus is stopped unexpectedly and boarded by three men: Veeru's henchman Deva (John Kokken), Veeru's brother Ajay ([[Ajay_(actor)|Ajay]]), and a corrupt police inspector, Shravan. They kill Deepthi in front of Satya, and he suffers an almost-fatal stab wound. Before the three leave, they set fire to the bus, leaving Satya to his death after stabbing him. However, Dr. Shailaja saves Satya by giving him a new face and skin. Ten months later, Satya wakes up from his coma.\n\nUnder the pseudonym of Ram, Satya returns to Visakhapatnam where he meets a model named Shruti, whom Veeru likes. Befriending Shruti, he takes advantage of his new unknown face, and lures Deva to a half-constructed apartment (or unconstructed building), where Satya kills Deva. A photo of Deva is discovered by [[Assistant commissioner|ACP]] Durani, which has been marked with a \"1\". Satya then files a report on Deepthi with the police, stating that she has been missing for ten days. Since Inspector Bhanu knows that Deepthi was killed ten months earlier, he becomes suspicious of Satya in his new persona, and follows him to a mall, where Satya kills him. During the investigation on Bhanu's death, Satya presents himself to Durani as an eyewitness. When asked to provide a description of the killer, Satya describes his former face. Satya then manipulates Ajay to fall in love with Shruti and gets the two of them to pose in compromising positions for some pictures, under the pretense that they will be used as a promotion to assist Shruti in getting an opportunity to audition for the female lead in a film. Instead, Satya sends copies of the pictures to Veeru, to turn him against both Ajay and Shruti. Satya then convinces Ajay that the only way to save Shruti from Veeru's ire is to kill Veeru, which would also allow Ajay to gain his brother's position. However, Veeru's henchmen kill Ajay, but Veeru is himself killed by Satya, who reveals his true identity. He apologises to Shruti for using her, before leaving.\n\nHis vengeance fulfilled, Satya departs from Visakhapatnam. On the way, a stranger attacks Satya, but is killed. Suspecting that the attack might have something to do with his new face, Satya visits Dr. Shailaja. When they meet, Shailaja confesses that she has given Satya the face of her deceased son, Charan; she then goes on to explain the circumstances surrounding Charan's death. Charan was a happy-go-lucky rich graduate who hung out with his friends and girlfriend, Manju. One of his friends, Shashank, questions the local don, Dharma, regarding his illegal acquisition of lands by exploiting the slum people. Threatened, Dharma kills Shashank, after which Charan begins to raise support among the local population to revolt against Dharma. Again threatened, Dharma approaches another one of Charan's friends, Sharath, promising to establish his political career if he kills Charan. Charan and Sharath go to Visakhapatnam to attend a wedding. On their return, they board the same bus as Satya and Deepthi. When the bus was stopped, Sharath pulls a knife on Charan and the two engage in a fight. Veeru's men simultaneously enter the bus. Deepthi is killed inside the bus while Charan and Sharath's struggle has led them outside the bus, a huge fight ensues. After Charan kills Dharma's henchman, Murugan, Charan tells his inability to kill Sharath as he was his friend. Charan is then stabbed from behind by Dharma, but to Dharma's surprise is still confident. Charan then recieves the final and fatal stab from Sharath and dies. Charan's body is sent to Shailaja, who after observing Satya's urge to live decides to transplant her son's face onto Satya, rather than simple plastic surgery. Before Shailaja could inform Satya about Charan, Satya had left the hospital.\n\nLeaving Shailaja, Satya visits the slum, under the guise of Charan. After meeting the locals, he decides to avenge Charan's death. First, he meets Sharath in a political meeting and, using the shock of Charan seemingly being alive, makes him kill Dharma. Satya makes the slum people follow Sharath to Dharma's house. Sharath stabs Dharma, who in turn kills Sharath. Dharma then tells Satya that even if he dies, he is going to take Satya along with him. He takes a sword and tries to kill Satya, but Satya dodges and Dharma accidently stabs the corrupt Central Minister. Satya pushes both off the roof. The Minister dies after the fall. However, the mob, which has followed Satya, finally kills Dharma. Afterwards, Manju is shown living in a distant land, mourning Charan's death. The film ends with Satya meeting her.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Ram Charan]] as Charan/Satya alias Ram\n* [[Shruti Haasan]] as Manju\n* [[Amy Jackson]] as Shruthi\n* [[Kajal Aggarwal]] as Deepti ([[Cameo appearance]])\n* [[Allu Arjun]] as Satya (Cameo appearance)\n* [[Sai Kumar (Kannada actor)|Sai Kumar]] as Dharma Bhai, the main antagonist\n* [[Rahul Dev]] as Veeru Bhai\n* [[Jayasudha]] as Dr. Shailaja\n* [[Ajay (actor)|Ajay]] as Ajay\n* [[Murali Sharma]] as [[Assistant commissioner|ACP]] Durani\n* [[Kota Srinivasa Rao]] as a corrupt central minister, and Dharma's partner\n* [[Shashank (actor)|Shashank]] as Shashank (Cameo appearance)\n* Raja as Sharath\n* [[Brahmanandam]] as Satya's illegal tenant\n* [[Vennela Kishore]] as Charan's friend\n* [[Subbaraju]] as Raja, Dharma's henchman\n* [[Prabhas Sreenu]] as Deva's sidekick \n* [[Supreeth]] as Bhukka\n* Shravan as Inspector Bhanu\n* Scarlett Mellish Wilson in the [[item number]] \"Ayyo Paapam\"\n{{colend}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\n[[Dil Raju]] wanted to produce a technically driven film and selected a script written by [[Vamsi Paidipally]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archives.deccanchronicle.com/130724/entertainment-tollywood/article/%E2%80%98my-dream-come-true%E2%80%99|title=\u2018My dream come true\u2019|newspaper=[[Deccan Chronicle]]|date=24 July 2013|accessdate=7 January 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107140008/http://archives.deccanchronicle.com/130724/entertainment-tollywood/article/%E2%80%98my-dream-come-true%E2%80%99|archivedate=7 January 2015}}</ref> Raju announced the project officially in early October 2011, as well as announcing that [[Ram Charan]] would star as the film's protagonist.

The film features [[Ram Charan]], [[Shruti Haasan]] and [[Amy Jackson]] in the lead roles, while [[Sai Kumar (Tollywood actor)|Sai Kumar]], [[Jayasudha]], [[Brahmanandam]] and [[Rahul Dev]] play supporting roles. It also featured [[Allu Arjun]] and [[Kajal Aggarwal]] in cameo roles. The film was produced by [[Dil Raju]] under the banner [[Sri Venkateswara Creations]]. [[Vakkantham Vamsi]] co-wrote the film's script with Paidipally. [[Devi Sri Prasad]] composed the film's music, while [[Marthand K. Venkatesh]] was the film's editor.\n\n''Yevadu'''s story was partially inspired by [[John Woo]]'s 1997 film, ''[[Face/Off]]'', and revolves around two strangers, Satya and Charan. It was made on a budget of {{INR}}350 million, and was officially launched on 9 December 2011. [[Principal photography]] began on 27 April 2012 and lasted until 22 July 2013. The majority of the film was shot in [[Visakhapatnam]] and [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], mostly in [[Ramoji Film City]], while two songs were shot in Switzerland and [[Bangkok]].\n\nReleased during the season of the [[Makar Sankranti]] festival, the film received decent feedback from critics. It grossed more than {{INR}}600&nbsp;million and collected a distributor share of {{INR}}471&nbsp;million, becoming one of the highest grossing Telugu films of 2014. The film was dubbed into [[Tamil language|Tamil]] as ''Magadheera'' and in [[Malayalam]] as ''Bhaiyya My Brother''.\n\n== Plot ==\nSatya ([[Allu_Arjun|Allu Arjun]]) and Deepthi ([[Kajal Aggarwal]]) are lovers living in Visakhapatnam. A dreaded don, Veeru Bhai ([[Rahul Dev]]), lusts for Deepthi. When Deepthi's parents are killed, she and Satya escape. They board a bus on route to Hyderabad, but the bus is stopped unexpectedly and boarded by three men: Veeru's henchman Deva (John Kokken), Veeru's brother Ajay ([[Ajay_(actor)|Ajay]]), and a corrupt police inspector, Shravan. They kill Deepthi in front of Satya, and he suffers an almost-fatal stab wound. Before the three leave, they set fire to the bus, leaving Satya to his death after stabbing him. However, Dr. Shailaja saves Satya by giving him a new face and skin. Ten months later, Satya wakes up from his coma.\n\nUnder the pseudonym of Ram, Satya returns to Visakhapatnam where he meets a model named Shruti, whom Veeru likes. Befriending Shruti, he takes advantage of his new unknown face, and lures Deva to a half-constructed apartment (or unconstructed building), where Satya kills Deva. A photo of Deva is discovered by [[Assistant commissioner|ACP]] Durani, which has been marked with a \"1\". Satya then files a report on Deepthi with the police, stating that she has been missing for ten days. Since Inspector Bhanu knows that Deepthi was killed ten months earlier, he becomes suspicious of Satya in his new persona, and follows him to a mall, where Satya kills him. During the investigation on Bhanu's death, Satya presents himself to Durani as an eyewitness. When asked to provide a description of the killer, Satya describes his former face. Satya then manipulates Ajay to fall in love with Shruti and gets the two of them to pose in compromising positions for some pictures, under the pretense that they will be used as a promotion to assist Shruti in getting an opportunity to audition for the female lead in a film. Instead, Satya sends copies of the pictures to Veeru, to turn him against both Ajay and Shruti. Satya then convinces Ajay that the only way to save Shruti from Veeru's ire is to kill Veeru, which would also allow Ajay to gain his brother's position. However, Veeru's henchmen kill Ajay, but Veeru is himself killed by Satya, who reveals his true identity. He apologises to Shruti for using her, before leaving.\n\nHis vengeance fulfilled, Satya departs from Visakhapatnam. On the way, a stranger attacks Satya, but is killed. Suspecting that the attack might have something to do with his new face, Satya visits Dr. Shailaja. When they meet, Shailaja confesses that she has given Satya the face of her deceased son, Charan; she then goes on to explain the circumstances surrounding Charan's death. Charan was a happy-go-lucky rich graduate who hung out with his friends and girlfriend, Manju. One of his friends, Shashank, questions the local don, Dharma, regarding his illegal acquisition of lands by exploiting the slum people. Threatened, Dharma kills Shashank, after which Charan begins to raise support among the local population to revolt against Dharma. Again threatened, Dharma approaches another one of Charan's friends, Sharath, promising to establish his political career if he kills Charan. Charan and Sharath go to Visakhapatnam to attend a wedding. On their return, they board the same bus as Satya and Deepthi. When the bus was stopped, Sharath pulls a knife on Charan and the two engage in a fight. Veeru's men simultaneously enter the bus. Deepthi is killed inside the bus while Charan and Sharath's struggle has led them outside the bus, a huge fight ensues. After Charan kills Dharma's henchman, Murugan, Charan tells his inability to kill Sharath as he was his friend. Charan is then stabbed from behind by Dharma, but to Dharma's surprise is still confident. Charan then recieves the final and fatal stab from Sharath and dies. Charan's body is sent to Shailaja, who after observing Satya's urge to live decides to transplant her son's face onto Satya, rather than simple plastic surgery. Before Shailaja could inform Satya about Charan, Satya had left the hospital.\n\nLeaving Shailaja, Satya visits the slum, under the guise of Charan. After meeting the locals, he decides to avenge Charan's death. First, he meets Sharath in a political meeting and, using the shock of Charan seemingly being alive, makes him kill Dharma. Satya makes the slum people follow Sharath to Dharma's house. Sharath stabs Dharma, who in turn kills Sharath. Dharma then tells Satya that even if he dies, he is going to take Satya along with him. He takes a sword and tries to kill Satya, but Satya dodges and Dharma accidently stabs the corrupt Central Minister. Satya pushes both off the roof. The Minister dies after the fall. However, the mob, which has followed Satya, finally kills Dharma. Afterwards, Manju is shown living in a distant land, mourning Charan's death. The film ends with Satya meeting her.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Ram Charan]] as Charan/Satya alias Ram\n* [[Shruti Haasan]] as Manju\n* [[Amy Jackson]] as Shruthi\n* [[Kajal Aggarwal]] as Deepti ([[Cameo appearance]])\n* [[Allu Arjun]] as Satya (Cameo appearance)\n* [[Sai Kumar (Kannada actor)|Sai Kumar]] as Dharma Bhai, the main antagonist\n* [[Rahul Dev]] as Veeru Bhai\n* [[Jayasudha]] as Dr. Shailaja\n* [[Ajay (actor)|Ajay]] as Ajay\n* [[Murali Sharma]] as [[Assistant commissioner|ACP]] Durani\n* [[Kota Srinivasa Rao]] as a corrupt central minister, and Dharma's partner\n* [[Shashank (actor)|Shashank]] as Shashank (Cameo appearance)\n* Raja as Sharath\n* [[Brahmanandam]] as Satya's illegal tenant\n* [[Vennela Kishore]] as Charan's friend\n* [[Subbaraju]] as Raja, Dharma's henchman\n* [[Prabhas Sreenu]] as Deva's sidekick \n* [[Supreeth]] as Bhukka\n* Shravan as Inspector Bhanu\n* Scarlett Mellish Wilson in the [[item number]] \"Ayyo Paapam\"\n{{colend}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\n[[Dil Raju]] wanted to produce a technically driven film and selected a script written by [[Vamsi Paidipally]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archives.deccanchronicle.com/130724/entertainment-tollywood/article/%E2%80%98my-dream-come-true%E2%80%99|title=\u2018My dream come true\u2019|newspaper=[[Deccan Chronicle]]|date=24 July 2013|accessdate=7 January 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107140008/http://archives.deccanchronicle.com/130724/entertainment-tollywood/article/%E2%80%98my-dream-come-true%E2%80%99|archivedate=7 January 2015}}</ref> Raju announced the project officially in early October 2011, as well as announcing that [[Ram Charan]] would star as the film's protagonist.

His mother wants him to follow the same path, but he is not interested. He is about to give his first live concert on [[New Year's Eve]] with his bandmates in [[Hyderabad]]. However, Vivek is late to catch the flight, forcing the band to travel by road. After sometime, one of their tyres get deflated. Not having a spare, the other friends go to get the tyre inflated, leaving Vivek and Lasya ([[Lekha Washington]]) alone. Meanwhile, they are attacked by a [[Hindu]] fanatic group. However, they manage to get out of the mess with the help of a [[Sikhism|Sikh]] truck driver who incidentally gets involved in an earlier altercation with Vivek. The band successfully reaches Hyderabad. However, they suffer a minor accident there, which involves a mother in [[Childbirth|labour]], So Vivek and Lasya take her to a hospital nearby.\n\nSaroja ([[Anushka Shetty|Anushka]]) is a [[prostitute]] in [[Amalapuram]] working for Rattamma. She has a best friend Karpooram (Nikki), who is a [[eunuch]]. Saroja doesn't like working for Rattamma and plans to run away from there. Her dreams come true when she receives a call from Hyderabad from one of her agents. The very next day, which happens to be New Year's Eve, she leaves for Hyderabad with Karpooram without Rattamma's knowledge, but not before putting the local [[sub-inspector]] Bullebbayi ([[Prudhviraj (Telugu actor)|Prudhviraj]]) to sleep using pills after sleeping with him. However, Saroja is arrested in Hyderabad by constables for betraying Bullebbayi. Karpooram frees her from the inspector, and both are taken by their agent to a client. The client turns out to be yet another broker who bought Saroja and Karpooram from Rattamma. Both successfully escape from the broker after a scuffle, during which Karpooram gets stabbed. So, Saroja takes her to the same hospital that Vivek and Lasya take the pregnant lady to.\n\nRamulu (Nagayya) is a debt-ridden weaver from [[Sircilla]]. He lives with his widowed daughter-in-law Padma ([[Saranya Ponvannan]]) and grandson. Ramulu is desperate to get his grandson educated, being illiterate himself. However he owes money to the local landlord, who takes his grandson away, saying he would be sent to the construction business in the city for 11 years to recover the money. He gives Ramulu and Padma three days to clear the debt. Not knowing what to do, Padma agrees to sell her [[kidney]], which is illegal, as Ramulu had previously sold his kidney for the same purpose. They come to Hyderabad, and her kidney is sold successfully in the hospital where the previous four characters are. The original kidney is sold for {{INR}}1,00,000, of which Ramulu gets {{INR}}37,000.\n\nRahimuddin Qureshi ([[Manoj Bajpayee]]) is a [[Muslim]] hailing from Old Basti in Hyderabad. In the past, his wife suffered a [[miscarriage]] due to a scuffle between him and a few [[Ganesh]] devotees during a religious procession. Unable to bear the loss, he decides to leave the country. However, during his farewell party, Shivaram ([[Ravi Prakash (Telugu actor)|Ravi Prakash]]), who previously insulted Rahim during the scuffle, comes to his house and arrests his nephews, alleging that they have links with terrorists. When Rahim obstructs him, he arrests him too. During interrogation, one of his nephews accepts his terrorist background and says something tragic would happen on New Year's Eve. Rahim is shocked. When the police transports him to remand, Rahim panics and tries to escape. However, his escape bid is unsuccessful, and he gets shot in the leg. He is then taken to the same hospital as the rest of the characters are in and kept in the same ward as another terrorist suspect.\n\nAnand Raj also known as Cable Raju ([[Allu Arjun]]) is a [[lower middle class]] guy hailing from [[Jubilee Hills]] slum, living with his maternal grandmother. He loves Pooja ([[Deeksha Seth]]), who is from the upper class of the society. Pooja, however, doesn't know of Raju's financial background and thinks of him to be rich. Raju has to get two passes for a lavish New Year's Eve party which cost almost {{INR}}40,000. He tries to obtain that money by various means but is unsuccessful. He even tries to snatch chains from women's necks but is apprehended by the police when his motorbike hits a police van. He is taken to the police station where he meets Saroja. However, Dappu Subani ([[Raghu Babu]]), who initiated him into the chain snatching business, comes to his rescue and gets him freed. His grandmother, vexed at his behaviour, gives him 3,000 rupees and asks him to do whatever he wants. In a local cafeteria, he happens to see Ramulu with his money bundle, decides to steal it, and follows him to the hospital. He successfully manages to steal the bundle from Ramulu and Padma. However, as he is about to pay for the passes, he realizes his mistake, adds his own 3,000 rupees to the bundle and returns it to Ramulu at the hospital.\n\nMeanwhile, a group of terrorists come to the ward housing Rahim and free their leader. They leave Rahim unharmed on account of him being a Muslim and start the terrorist attack. Raju and Vivek try to save as many people as possible. They even kill two terrorists in the process. Rahim saves Shivaram's life. In the final fight sequence, Raju and Vivek valiantly give up their lives, trying to protect the people in the hospital.\n\nThe conclusion of the movie shows Saroja deciding to change her profession; Vivek was dead but is recognized as a national hero; Raju was dead being respected by all in his community, with Pooja coming to see him along with her mother; and Rahim being freed by Shivaram. As for Ramulu, the landlord tries to fool him by saying he did not pay enough, but Ramulu's grandson calculates and said he paid enough.

One day while travelling from [[Guntur]] to [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], he narrated the story of Nagayya (initially he named it as Jalayya) to cinematographer Gnana Sekhar, who also worked with him in ''[[Gamyam]]''. The second story initially he conceptualised was about a film crew and later changed it to music band. The title of ''Vedam'' struck him when he was penning the story at Sirivennela's home. Krish wanted to do the character of Karpooram, but decided against it after his mother warned him. Later, when discussing the story with [[Anushka Shetty]], she suggested her personal make-up person Nikki for the role and Krish liked him. Anushka reduced her remuneration by 30% as the film was a low budget production. Rahimuddin Qureshi (character played by [[Manoj Bajpai]]) is the name of Krish's best friend in intermediate. Nagayya was spotted by Krish. The climax of the film was an inspiration from [[2008 Mumbai attacks|26/11 Mumbai blasts]] in [[Taj Hotel]]. After getting a basic story line he decided to produce ''Vedam'' on his banner [[First Frame Entertainment]], before producers Shobu Yarlagadda and Prasad Devineni decided to finance it. The five principal characters were based on the five natural elements-Water, Air, Earth, Fire and Sky. It notably became the first film [[Allu Arjun]] and [[Manoj Manchu]] starred in that did not involve their respective fathers [[Allu Aravind]] and [[Mohan Babu]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idlebrain.com/movie/postmortem/vedam.html |title=Vedam \u2013 Post mortem \u2013 Telugu cinema \u2013 Krish |publisher=Idlebrain.com |date=4 January 2009 |accessdate=4 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n{{Infobox album\n| name         = Vedam\n| type         = Soundtrack\n| artist       = [[M.

His mother wants him to follow the same path, but he is not interested. He is about to give his first live concert on [[New Year's Eve]] with his bandmates in [[Hyderabad]]. However, Vivek is late to catch the flight, forcing the band to travel by road. After sometime, one of their tyres get deflated. Not having a spare, the other friends go to get the tyre inflated, leaving Vivek and Lasya ([[Lekha Washington]]) alone. Meanwhile, they are attacked by a [[Hindu]] fanatic group. However, they manage to get out of the mess with the help of a [[Sikhism|Sikh]] truck driver who incidentally gets involved in an earlier altercation with Vivek. The band successfully reaches Hyderabad. However, they suffer a minor accident there, which involves a mother in [[Childbirth|labour]], So Vivek and Lasya take her to a hospital nearby.\n\nSaroja ([[Anushka Shetty|Anushka]]) is a [[prostitute]] in [[Amalapuram]] working for Rattamma. She has a best friend Karpooram (Nikki), who is a [[eunuch]]. Saroja doesn't like working for Rattamma and plans to run away from there. Her dreams come true when she receives a call from Hyderabad from one of her agents. The very next day, which happens to be New Year's Eve, she leaves for Hyderabad with Karpooram without Rattamma's knowledge, but not before putting the local [[sub-inspector]] Bullebbayi ([[Prudhviraj (Telugu actor)|Prudhviraj]]) to sleep using pills after sleeping with him. However, Saroja is arrested in Hyderabad by constables for betraying Bullebbayi. Karpooram frees her from the inspector, and both are taken by their agent to a client. The client turns out to be yet another broker who bought Saroja and Karpooram from Rattamma. Both successfully escape from the broker after a scuffle, during which Karpooram gets stabbed. So, Saroja takes her to the same hospital that Vivek and Lasya take the pregnant lady to.\n\nRamulu (Nagayya) is a debt-ridden weaver from [[Sircilla]]. He lives with his widowed daughter-in-law Padma ([[Saranya Ponvannan]]) and grandson. Ramulu is desperate to get his grandson educated, being illiterate himself. However he owes money to the local landlord, who takes his grandson away, saying he would be sent to the construction business in the city for 11 years to recover the money. He gives Ramulu and Padma three days to clear the debt. Not knowing what to do, Padma agrees to sell her [[kidney]], which is illegal, as Ramulu had previously sold his kidney for the same purpose. They come to Hyderabad, and her kidney is sold successfully in the hospital where the previous four characters are. The original kidney is sold for {{INR}}1,00,000, of which Ramulu gets {{INR}}37,000.\n\nRahimuddin Qureshi ([[Manoj Bajpayee]]) is a [[Muslim]] hailing from Old Basti in Hyderabad. In the past, his wife suffered a [[miscarriage]] due to a scuffle between him and a few [[Ganesh]] devotees during a religious procession. Unable to bear the loss, he decides to leave the country. However, during his farewell party, Shivaram ([[Ravi Prakash (Telugu actor)|Ravi Prakash]]), who previously insulted Rahim during the scuffle, comes to his house and arrests his nephews, alleging that they have links with terrorists. When Rahim obstructs him, he arrests him too. During interrogation, one of his nephews accepts his terrorist background and says something tragic would happen on New Year's Eve. Rahim is shocked. When the police transports him to remand, Rahim panics and tries to escape. However, his escape bid is unsuccessful, and he gets shot in the leg. He is then taken to the same hospital as the rest of the characters are in and kept in the same ward as another terrorist suspect.\n\nAnand Raj also known as Cable Raju ([[Allu Arjun]]) is a [[lower middle class]] guy hailing from [[Jubilee Hills]] slum, living with his maternal grandmother. He loves Pooja ([[Deeksha Seth]]), who is from the upper class of the society. Pooja, however, doesn't know of Raju's financial background and thinks of him to be rich. Raju has to get two passes for a lavish New Year's Eve party which cost almost {{INR}}40,000. He tries to obtain that money by various means but is unsuccessful. He even tries to snatch chains from women's necks but is apprehended by the police when his motorbike hits a police van. He is taken to the police station where he meets Saroja. However, Dappu Subani ([[Raghu Babu]]), who initiated him into the chain snatching business, comes to his rescue and gets him freed. His grandmother, vexed at his behaviour, gives him 3,000 rupees and asks him to do whatever he wants. In a local cafeteria, he happens to see Ramulu with his money bundle, decides to steal it, and follows him to the hospital. He successfully manages to steal the bundle from Ramulu and Padma. However, as he is about to pay for the passes, he realizes his mistake, adds his own 3,000 rupees to the bundle and returns it to Ramulu at the hospital.\n\nMeanwhile, a group of terrorists come to the ward housing Rahim and free their leader. They leave Rahim unharmed on account of him being a Muslim and start the terrorist attack. Raju and Vivek try to save as many people as possible. They even kill two terrorists in the process. Rahim saves Shivaram's life. In the final fight sequence, Raju and Vivek valiantly give up their lives, trying to protect the people in the hospital.\n\nThe conclusion of the movie shows Saroja deciding to change her profession; Vivek was dead but is recognized as a national hero; Raju was dead being respected by all in his community, with Pooja coming to see him along with her mother; and Rahim being freed by Shivaram. As for Ramulu, the landlord tries to fool him by saying he did not pay enough, but Ramulu's grandson calculates and said he paid enough. The landlord is impressed and lets them go.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Allu Arjun]] as Anand Raj / Cable Raju\n* [[Anushka Shetty]] as Saroja\n* [[Manoj Manchu]] as Vivek Chakravarti\n* [[Manoj Bajpayee]] as Rahimuddin Qureshi\n* [[Saranya Ponvannan]] as Padma\n* Nagayya as Ramulu\n* [[Deeksha Seth]] as Pooja\n* [[Lekha Washington]] as Lasya\n* Siya Gautam as Zara\n* [[Brahmanandam]] as Brother Bairagi\n* [[Posani Krishna Murali]] as Police Inspector\n* [[Raghu Babu]] as Dappu Subani\n* [[Ravi Prakash (Telugu actor)|Ravi Prakash]] as Shivaram\n* Nikki as Karpooram\n* [[Prudhviraj (Telugu actor)|Prudhviraj]] as Bullebbayi\n* [[Ravi Raghavendra]] as Kidney Transplant Surgeon\n* [[Satyam Rajesh]] as Ganapati\n* [[Nagineedu]] as terrorist\n* Joy Badlani as Rehmath\n* [[Kallu Chidambaram]]\n* Giridhar as Koti\n* Rakesh Varre\n* Appa Rao\n* [[Krish (director)|Krish]] as a ''[[sadhu]]'' in a [[cameo appearance]] in the song \"Rupayi\"\n{{colend}}\n\n==Production==\nDirector Krish had a visual of an old man walking along with a child in his dreams.
