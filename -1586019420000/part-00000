Its allegiance was to the [[Polish government-in-exile]], and it constituted the armed wing of what became known as the \"[[Polish Underground State]]\".\n\nEstimates of the Home Army's 1944 strength range between 200,000 and 600,000, the most commonly cited number being 400,000. This last number would make the Home Army not only the largest Polish underground [[resistance movement]] but one of the three largest in Europe during World War II.{{efn|name=a}} The Home Army was disbanded on 19 January 1945, after the Soviet [[Red Army]] had largely cleared [[Polish territory]] of German forces.\n\nThe Home Army [[sabotage]]d German operations such as transports headed for the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] in the Soviet Union.  It also fought several full-scale [[battle]]s against the Germans, particularly in 1943 and in [[Operation Tempest]] in 1944. The Home Army tied down substantial German forces and destroyed much-needed German supplies.\n\nThe most widely known Home Army operation was the 1944 [[Warsaw Uprising]]. The partisans also defended Polish civilians against [[ethnic violence|atrocities]] perpetrated by other military formations.\n\nBecause the Home Army was loyal to the Polish Government-in-Exile, the Soviet Union saw it as an obstacle to [[Communism in Poland]]. Consequently, over the course of the war, conflict grew between the Home Army and Soviet forces. During the Soviet occupation of Poland thousands of former Home Army operatives were deported to [[Gulag]]s and Soviet prisons, while others\u2014including senior commanders like [[Leopold Okulicki]] and [[Emil August Fieldorf]]\u2014were executed.\n\nFollowing the war, the official propaganda line in communist Poland was that the Home Army was an oppressive and reactionary force, at least in the 1950s and 1960s. Following the fall of communism in Eastern Europe the image of the Home Army has been more positive.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Jeffrey|last=Blutinger|jstor=10.5703/shofar.29.1.73|title=An Inconvenient Past: Post-Communist Holocaust Memorialization|journal=Shofar|volume=29|issue=1|pages=73\u201394|date=Fall 2010}}</ref>{{sfnp|Zimmerman|2015|p=4}}\n\n==History and operations==\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Band of Polish Home Army (Armia Krajowa).PNG|left|thumb|Armband worn by Home Army soldiers]]\n\nThe Home Army originated in the [[Service for Poland's Victory]] (''S\u0142u\u017cba Zwyci\u0119stwu Polski''), which General [[Micha\u0142 Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski]] set up on 27 September 1939, just as the coordinated [[German invasion of Poland|German]] and [[Soviet invasion of Poland (1939)|Soviet invasions of Poland]] neared completion.<ref name=\"MNK\" /> Seven weeks later, on 17 November 1939, on the orders of General [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]], the Service for Poland's Victory was superseded by the [[Union for Armed Struggle|Armed Resistance]] (''Zwi\u0105zek Walki Zbrojnej''), which in turn, a little over two years later, on 14 February 1942, became the \"Home Army\".<ref name=\"MNK\" /><ref name=\"Enc.

In 1943 it was renamed to [[Home Political Representation]] (''Krajowa Reprezentacja Polityczna'') and in 1944 to [[Council of National Unity]] (''Rada Jedno\u015bci Narodowej'').{{r|Leslie|pp=235\u2013236}}\n\nThe Home Army, though in theory subordinate to the civil authorities and to the Government in Exile, often acted somewhat independently, with neither the Home Army's commanders in Poland nor the \"London government\" fully aware of the others' situation.{{r|Leslie|pp=235\u2013236}}\n\nAfter [[Operation Barbarossa|Germany started its invasion of the Soviet Union]] on 22 June 1941, the Soviet Union joined the [[Allies in World War II|Allies]] and signed an [[Anglo-Soviet Agreement]] on 12 July 1941. This put the Polish Government in a difficult position, since it had previously pursued a policy of \"two enemies\". Though a [[Sikorski\u2013Mayski Agreement|Polish\u2013Soviet agreement]] was signed in August 1941, cooperation continued to be difficult and deteriorated further after 1943 when Nazi Germany publicized the [[Katyn massacre]] of 1940.<ref name=\"Michta 1990\" />\n\nUntil the major rising in 1944, the Home Army concentrated on self-defense (the freeing of prisoners and hostages, defense against German pacification operations) and on attacks against German forces. Home Army units carried out thousands of armed raids and intelligence operations, sabotaged hundreds of railway shipments, and participated in many [[partisan (military)|partisan]] clashes and battles with German police and [[Wehrmacht]] units. The Home Army also assassinated prominent [[Collaboration during World War II|Nazi collaborators]] and [[Gestapo]] officials in retaliation against Nazi terror inflicted on Poland's civilian population; prominent individuals assassinated by the Home Army included [[Igo Sym]] (1941) and [[Franz Kutschera]] (1944).<ref name=\"MNK\" /><ref name=\"Enc.

However, many former Home Army units decided to continue operations. The Soviet Union, and the [[Polish communist|Polish Communist Government]] that it controlled, viewed the underground, still loyal to the [[Polish government-in-exile]], as a force to be extirpated before they could gain complete control of Poland. Future [[Secretary General]] of the [[Polish United Workers' Party]], [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]], is quoted as saying: \"Soldiers of the AK are a hostile element which must be removed without mercy.\" Another prominent Polish communist, [[Roman Zambrowski]], said that the Home Army had to be \"exterminated.\"<ref name=\"Rzecz\"/>{{Better source|reason=not scholarly / not English|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe first Home Army structure designed primarily to deal with the Soviet threat had been ''[[NIE (resistance)|NIE]]'', formed in mid-1943. Its aim was not to engage Soviet forces in combat, but to observe them and to gather intelligence while the Polish Government-in-Exile decided how to deal with the Soviets; at that time, the exiled government still believed in the possibility of constructive negotiations with the Soviets. On 7 May 1945 ''NIE'' (\"NO\") was disbande and transformed into an [[Armed Forces Delegation for Poland]] (''Delegatura Si\u0142 Zbrojnych na Kraj''); but this organization lasted only until 8 August 1945, when it was decided to disband it and to stop partisan resistance.<ref name=\"Rzecz\"/>{{Better source|reason=not scholarly / not English|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe first Polish communist government, the [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]], formed in July 1944, declined to accept jurisdiction over Home Army soldiers, therefore for over a year [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] agencies such as the [[NKVD]] took responsibility for disarming the Home Army. By war's end, some 60,000 Home Army soldiers had been arrested, 50,000 of whom were deported to Soviet [[Gulag]]s and prisons; most of these soldiers had been taken captive by the Soviets during, or in the aftermath of, [[Operation Tempest]], when many Home Army units tried to work together with the Soviets in a nationwide uprising against the Germans.

Its primary goal was not combat, either.

Viewed as enemies of the state, starved of resources, and with a vocal faction advocating armed resistance against the Soviets and their Polish proxies, ''WiN'' was far from efficient. A major victory for the Soviet [[NKVD]] and the newly created Polish secret police, ''[[Urz\u0105d Bezpiecze\u0144stwa]]'' (''UB''), came in the second half of 1945, when they managed to convince several Home Army and ''WiN'' leaders that they truly wanted to offer [[amnesty]] to Home Army members. Over a few months they gained information about great numbers of Home Army and ''WiN'' people and resources. By the time the (imprisoned) Home Army and ''WiN'' leaders realized their mistake, the organizations had been crippled, with thousands of their members arrested. ''WiN'' was finally disbanded in 1952.

Nevertheless, the difficult conditions meant that only infantry forces armed with light weapons could be fielded. Any use of artillery, armor or aircraft was impossible (except for a few instances during the [[Warsaw Uprising]], such as the ''[[Kubu\u015b]]'' [[armored car (military)|armored car]]).<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/> Even these light-infantry units were as a rule armed with a mixture of weapons of various types, usually in quantities sufficient to arm only a fraction of a unit's soldiers.<ref name=\"Laqueur\"/>{{r|Leslie|p=234}}<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/>\n\nHome Army arms and equipment came mostly from four sources: arms that had been buried by the Polish armies on battlefields after the 1939 [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invasion of Poland]]; arms purchased or captured from the Germans and their allies; arms clandestinely manufactured by the Home Army itself; and arms received from Allied air drops.<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/>\n\n[[File:Warsaw Uprising by Deczkowki - Wacek Platoon - 15911.jpg|thumb|left|Captured German [[Panther tank]], operated by ''[[Batalion Zo\u015bka]]'' armored platoon commanded by [[Wac\u0142aw Micuta]]]]\nFrom arms caches hidden in 1939, the Home Army obtained: 614 heavy machine guns, 1,193 light machine guns, 33,052 rifles, 6,732 pistols, 28 antitank light field guns, 25 antitank rifles, and 43,154 hand grenades.<ref name=\"Korb\"/> However, due to their inadequate preservation, which had had to be improvised in the chaos of the September Campaign, most of the guns were in poor condition. Of those that had been buried in the ground and had been dug up in 1944 during preparations for Operation Tempest, only 30% were usable.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nSometimes arms were purchased on the [[black market]] from German soldiers or their allies, or stolen from German supply depots or transports.<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/> Purchases were made by individual units and sometimes by individual soldiers. As Germany's prospects for victory diminished and the morale in German units dropped, the number of soldiers willing to sell their weapons correspondingly increased and thus made this source more important.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} All such purchases were highly risky, as the [[Gestapo]] was well aware of this black market in arms and tried to check it by setting up sting operations. For the most part this trade was limited to personal weapons, but occasionally light and heavy machine guns could also be purchased. It was much easier to trade with Italian and Hungarian units stationed in Poland, which more willingly sold their arms to the Polish underground as long as they could conceal this trade from the Germans.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nEfforts to capture weapons from the Germans also proved highly successful. Raids were conducted on trains carrying equipment to the front, as well as on guardhouses and [[gendarmerie]] posts. Sometimes weapons were taken from individual German soldiers accosted in the street. During the Warsaw Uprising, the Home Army even managed to capture several German armored vehicles.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n[[File:B\u0142yskawica and other insurgent weapons.jpg|thumb|Polish weapons, including (''top'') [[B\u0142yskawica submachine gun|''B\u0142yskawica'' (\"Lightning\") submachine gun]], one of very few weapons designed and mass-produced covertly in occupied Europe]]\n[[File:Filipinka sidol\u00f3wka.jpg|thumb|Home Army-made ''[[Sidol\u00f3wka]]'' (left) and ''[[Filipinka]]'' (right) [[grenade]]s, [[Museum of the Warsaw Rising]]]]\nArms were clandestinely manufactured by the Home Army in its own secret workshops, and also by Home Army members working in German armaments factories.<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/>{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} In this way the Home Army was able to procure [[submachine gun]]s (copies of British [[Sten]]s, indigenous ''[[B\u0142yskawica submachine gun|B\u0142yskawica]]s'' and ''[[KIS (weapon)|KIS]]''), pistols (''[[Vis (weapon)|Vis]]''), flamethrowers, explosive devices, road mines, and ''[[Filipinka]]'' and ''[[Sidol\u00f3wka]]'' [[hand grenade]]s.<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/> Hundreds of people were involved in the manufacturing effort.  The Home Army did not produce its own ammunition, but relied on supplies stolen by Polish workers from German-run factories.<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/>\n\nThe final source of supply was Allied [[air drop]]s.

Its allegiance was to the [[Polish government-in-exile]], and it constituted the armed wing of what became known as the \"[[Polish Underground State]]\".\n\nEstimates of the Home Army's 1944 strength range between 200,000 and 600,000, the most commonly cited number being 400,000. This last number would make the Home Army not only the largest Polish underground [[resistance movement]] but one of the three largest in Europe during World War II.{{efn|name=a}} The Home Army was disbanded on 19 January 1945, after the Soviet [[Red Army]] had largely cleared [[Polish territory]] of German forces.\n\nThe Home Army [[sabotage]]d German operations such as transports headed for the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] in the Soviet Union.  It also fought several full-scale [[battle]]s against the Germans, particularly in 1943 and in [[Operation Tempest]] in 1944. The Home Army tied down substantial German forces and destroyed much-needed German supplies.\n\nThe most widely known Home Army operation was the 1944 [[Warsaw Uprising]]. The partisans also defended Polish civilians against [[ethnic violence|atrocities]] perpetrated by other military formations.\n\nBecause the Home Army was loyal to the Polish Government-in-Exile, the Soviet Union saw it as an obstacle to [[Communism in Poland]]. Consequently, over the course of the war, conflict grew between the Home Army and Soviet forces. During the Soviet occupation of Poland thousands of former Home Army operatives were deported to [[Gulag]]s and Soviet prisons, while others\u2014including senior commanders like [[Leopold Okulicki]] and [[Emil August Fieldorf]]\u2014were executed.\n\nFollowing the war, the official propaganda line in communist Poland was that the Home Army was an oppressive and reactionary force, at least in the 1950s and 1960s. Following the fall of communism in Eastern Europe the image of the Home Army has been more positive.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Jeffrey|last=Blutinger|jstor=10.5703/shofar.29.1.73|title=An Inconvenient Past: Post-Communist Holocaust Memorialization|journal=Shofar|volume=29|issue=1|pages=73\u201394|date=Fall 2010}}</ref>{{sfnp|Zimmerman|2015|p=4}}\n\n==History and operations==\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Band of Polish Home Army (Armia Krajowa).PNG|left|thumb|Armband worn by Home Army soldiers]]\n\nThe Home Army originated in the [[Service for Poland's Victory]] (''S\u0142u\u017cba Zwyci\u0119stwu Polski''), which General [[Micha\u0142 Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski]] set up on 27 September 1939, just as the coordinated [[German invasion of Poland|German]] and [[Soviet invasion of Poland (1939)|Soviet invasions of Poland]] neared completion.<ref name=\"MNK\" /> Seven weeks later, on 17 November 1939, on the orders of General [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]], the Service for Poland's Victory was superseded by the [[Union for Armed Struggle|Armed Resistance]] (''Zwi\u0105zek Walki Zbrojnej''), which in turn, a little over two years later, on 14 February 1942, became the \"Home Army\".<ref name=\"MNK\" /><ref name=\"Enc.

WIEM: AK\" /> The supreme command defined the Home Army's chief tasks as partisan warfare against the German occupiers, re-creation of armed forces underground and, near the end of the German occupation, a general armed rising to be prosecuted until victory.<ref name=\"MNK\" /><ref name=\"Enc.

WIEM: AK\" /> Home Army plans envisioned, at war's end, the seizure of [[power (sociology)|power]] in Poland by the [[Government Delegation for Poland]] (the ''Delegatura'') and by the Government in Exile itself, which expected to return to Poland.\n\nIn addition to the Polish government in London, a political organization operated in Poland itself\u2014a deliberative body of the resistance and of the [[Polish Underground State]]. The [[Political Consultative Committee]] (''Polityczny Komitet Porozumiewawczy'')  formed in 1940 pursuant to an agreement between several major political parties: the [[Polish Socialist Party|Socialist Party]], [[People's Party (Poland)|People's Party]], [[National Party (Poland)|National Party]] and [[Labor Party (Stronnictwo Pracy)|Labor Party]]. In 1943 it was renamed to [[Home Political Representation]] (''Krajowa Reprezentacja Polityczna'') and in 1944 to [[Council of National Unity]] (''Rada Jedno\u015bci Narodowej'').{{r|Leslie|pp=235\u2013236}}\n\nThe Home Army, though in theory subordinate to the civil authorities and to the Government in Exile, often acted somewhat independently, with neither the Home Army's commanders in Poland nor the \"London government\" fully aware of the others' situation.{{r|Leslie|pp=235\u2013236}}\n\nAfter [[Operation Barbarossa|Germany started its invasion of the Soviet Union]] on 22 June 1941, the Soviet Union joined the [[Allies in World War II|Allies]] and signed an [[Anglo-Soviet Agreement]] on 12 July 1941. This put the Polish Government in a difficult position, since it had previously pursued a policy of \"two enemies\".

However, many former Home Army units decided to continue operations. The Soviet Union, and the [[Polish communist|Polish Communist Government]] that it controlled, viewed the underground, still loyal to the [[Polish government-in-exile]], as a force to be extirpated before they could gain complete control of Poland. Future [[Secretary General]] of the [[Polish United Workers' Party]], [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]], is quoted as saying: \"Soldiers of the AK are a hostile element which must be removed without mercy.\" Another prominent Polish communist, [[Roman Zambrowski]], said that the Home Army had to be \"exterminated.\"<ref name=\"Rzecz\"/>{{Better source|reason=not scholarly / not English|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe first Home Army structure designed primarily to deal with the Soviet threat had been ''[[NIE (resistance)|NIE]]'', formed in mid-1943. Its aim was not to engage Soviet forces in combat, but to observe them and to gather intelligence while the Polish Government-in-Exile decided how to deal with the Soviets; at that time, the exiled government still believed in the possibility of constructive negotiations with the Soviets. On 7 May 1945 ''NIE'' (\"NO\") was disbande and transformed into an [[Armed Forces Delegation for Poland]] (''Delegatura Si\u0142 Zbrojnych na Kraj''); but this organization lasted only until 8 August 1945, when it was decided to disband it and to stop partisan resistance.<ref name=\"Rzecz\"/>{{Better source|reason=not scholarly / not English|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe first Polish communist government, the [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]], formed in July 1944, declined to accept jurisdiction over Home Army soldiers, therefore for over a year [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] agencies such as the [[NKVD]] took responsibility for disarming the Home Army. By war's end, some 60,000 Home Army soldiers had been arrested, 50,000 of whom were deported to Soviet [[Gulag]]s and prisons; most of these soldiers had been taken captive by the Soviets during, or in the aftermath of, [[Operation Tempest]], when many Home Army units tried to work together with the Soviets in a nationwide uprising against the Germans. Other Home Army veterans were arrested when they approached Polish communist government officials after having been promised [[amnesty]].

Its primary goal was not combat, either.

Viewed as enemies of the state, starved of resources, and with a vocal faction advocating armed resistance against the Soviets and their Polish proxies, ''WiN'' was far from efficient. A major victory for the Soviet [[NKVD]] and the newly created Polish secret police, ''[[Urz\u0105d Bezpiecze\u0144stwa]]'' (''UB''), came in the second half of 1945, when they managed to convince several Home Army and ''WiN'' leaders that they truly wanted to offer [[amnesty]] to Home Army members. Over a few months they gained information about great numbers of Home Army and ''WiN'' people and resources. By the time the (imprisoned) Home Army and ''WiN'' leaders realized their mistake, the organizations had been crippled, with thousands of their members arrested. ''WiN'' was finally disbanded in 1952.

Nevertheless, the difficult conditions meant that only infantry forces armed with light weapons could be fielded. Any use of artillery, armor or aircraft was impossible (except for a few instances during the [[Warsaw Uprising]], such as the ''[[Kubu\u015b]]'' [[armored car (military)|armored car]]).<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/> Even these light-infantry units were as a rule armed with a mixture of weapons of various types, usually in quantities sufficient to arm only a fraction of a unit's soldiers.<ref name=\"Laqueur\"/>{{r|Leslie|p=234}}<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/>\n\nHome Army arms and equipment came mostly from four sources: arms that had been buried by the Polish armies on battlefields after the 1939 [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invasion of Poland]]; arms purchased or captured from the Germans and their allies; arms clandestinely manufactured by the Home Army itself; and arms received from Allied air drops.<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/>\n\n[[File:Warsaw Uprising by Deczkowki - Wacek Platoon - 15911.jpg|thumb|left|Captured German [[Panther tank]], operated by ''[[Batalion Zo\u015bka]]'' armored platoon commanded by [[Wac\u0142aw Micuta]]]]\nFrom arms caches hidden in 1939, the Home Army obtained: 614 heavy machine guns, 1,193 light machine guns, 33,052 rifles, 6,732 pistols, 28 antitank light field guns, 25 antitank rifles, and 43,154 hand grenades.<ref name=\"Korb\"/> However, due to their inadequate preservation, which had had to be improvised in the chaos of the September Campaign, most of the guns were in poor condition. Of those that had been buried in the ground and had been dug up in 1944 during preparations for Operation Tempest, only 30% were usable.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nSometimes arms were purchased on the [[black market]] from German soldiers or their allies, or stolen from German supply depots or transports.<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/> Purchases were made by individual units and sometimes by individual soldiers. As Germany's prospects for victory diminished and the morale in German units dropped, the number of soldiers willing to sell their weapons correspondingly increased and thus made this source more important.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} All such purchases were highly risky, as the [[Gestapo]] was well aware of this black market in arms and tried to check it by setting up sting operations. For the most part this trade was limited to personal weapons, but occasionally light and heavy machine guns could also be purchased. It was much easier to trade with Italian and Hungarian units stationed in Poland, which more willingly sold their arms to the Polish underground as long as they could conceal this trade from the Germans.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nEfforts to capture weapons from the Germans also proved highly successful. Raids were conducted on trains carrying equipment to the front, as well as on guardhouses and [[gendarmerie]] posts. Sometimes weapons were taken from individual German soldiers accosted in the street. During the Warsaw Uprising, the Home Army even managed to capture several German armored vehicles.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n[[File:B\u0142yskawica and other insurgent weapons.jpg|thumb|Polish weapons, including (''top'') [[B\u0142yskawica submachine gun|''B\u0142yskawica'' (\"Lightning\") submachine gun]], one of very few weapons designed and mass-produced covertly in occupied Europe]]\n[[File:Filipinka sidol\u00f3wka.jpg|thumb|Home Army-made ''[[Sidol\u00f3wka]]'' (left) and ''[[Filipinka]]'' (right) [[grenade]]s, [[Museum of the Warsaw Rising]]]]\nArms were clandestinely manufactured by the Home Army in its own secret workshops, and also by Home Army members working in German armaments factories.<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/>{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} In this way the Home Army was able to procure [[submachine gun]]s (copies of British [[Sten]]s, indigenous ''[[B\u0142yskawica submachine gun|B\u0142yskawica]]s'' and ''[[KIS (weapon)|KIS]]''), pistols (''[[Vis (weapon)|Vis]]''), flamethrowers, explosive devices, road mines, and ''[[Filipinka]]'' and ''[[Sidol\u00f3wka]]'' [[hand grenade]]s.<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/> Hundreds of people were involved in the manufacturing effort.  The Home Army did not produce its own ammunition, but relied on supplies stolen by Polish workers from German-run factories.<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/>\n\nThe final source of supply was Allied [[air drop]]s. This was the only way to obtain more exotic, highly useful equipment such as [[plastic explosives]] and antitank weapons such as the British [[PIAT]]. During the war, 485 air-drop missions from the West (about half of them flown by Polish airmen) delivered some 600 tons of supplies for the Polish resistance.<ref name=\"Peszke 2005\"/> Besides equipment, the planes also parachuted in highly qualified instructors ([[Silent Unseen]]), 316 of whom<ref name=\"Embassy PR 2006\"/> were inserted into Poland during the war.<ref name=\"Korb\"/>\n\nBut the air drops were too little, too late.
