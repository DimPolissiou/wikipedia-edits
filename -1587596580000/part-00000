In some jurisdictions (countries, states, provinces or regions), a [[sign language]] is an official language, whereas in others it has a protected status in certain areas such as education. Governments sometimes stipulate in their constitutions or laws that 'sign language' is recognised or protected, but they fail to specify ''which'' sign language exactly, as there may be several different sign languages in common use within its borders, which has led to problems.\n\nExtending legal recognition is one of the major concerns of the international [[Deaf community]], however, symbolic recognition is no guarantee for an effective improvement of the life of sign language users, and it has been argued that sign languages should be recognized and supported not merely as an accommodation for the disabled, but as the communication medium of language communities.<ref>Sarah C.

In some jurisdictions (countries, states, provinces or regions), a [[sign language]] is an official language, whereas in others it has a protected status in certain areas such as education. Governments sometimes stipulate in their constitutions or laws that 'sign language' is recognised or protected, but they fail to specify ''which'' sign language exactly, as there may be several different sign languages in common use within its borders, which has led to problems.\n\nExtending legal recognition is one of the major concerns of the international [[Deaf community]], however, symbolic recognition is no guarantee for an effective improvement of the life of sign language users, and it has been argued that sign languages should be recognized and supported not merely as an accommodation for the disabled, but as the communication medium of language communities.<ref>Sarah C.

The AutoCAD-clone project was kept semi-secret under the project name ''\"Phoenix\".''\n\nIn December 1996 Autodesk announced that it would instead buy Softdesk outright for $90 million in common stock. A complaint regarding the inclusive sale of IntelliCADD was filed with the US [[Federal Trade Commission]] (\"FTC\").

Boomerang negotiated with Softdesk for the purchase of the IntelliCADD product and exchanged draft purchase agreements with Softdesk. Softdesk, however, terminated those negotiations at around the time that Autodesk agreed to acquire Softdesk. Softdesk representatives previously told Boomerang that Softdesk would sell the IntelliCADD product to Boomerang if Softdesk were purchased by someone other than Autodesk, but would not sell it to Boomerang if Softdesk were purchased by Autodesk...''\n\n:''After being advised by Commission staff that Autodesk's acquisition of Softdesk raised competitive concerns in the market for personal computer-based CAD engines, Softdesk resumed negotiations with Boomerang and divested and sold all of its rights in the IntelliCADD product to Boomerang pursuant to a Technology Transfer Agreement dated February 21, 1997. On that same date, Boomerang assigned and sold all of its rights to the IntelliCADD product to Visio Corporation.''\n\nBy late 1996 a formal search for new venture capital was underway.

The Visigoths emerged from earlier Gothic groups, including a large group of [[Thervingi]], who had moved into the Roman Empire beginning in 376 and had played a major role in defeating the Romans at the [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378.{{sfn|Heather|1998|pp=52\u201357, 300\u2013301}} Relations between the Romans and the Visigoths were variable, alternately warring with one another and making treaties when convenient.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=843}} Under their first leader [[Alaric I]] they invaded Italy and [[sack of Rome (410)|sacked Rome in 410]]. Afterwards, they began settling down, first in southern [[Gaul]] and eventually in [[Hispania]], where they founded the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] and maintained a presence from the 5th to the 8th centuries AD.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|pp=843\u2013844}}\n\nThe Visigoths first settled in southern Gaul as ''[[foederati]]'' to the Romans, a relationship established in 418. However, they soon fell out with their Roman hosts (for reasons that are now obscure) and established their own kingdom with its [[Capital city|capital]] at [[Toulouse]]. They next extended their authority into [[Hispania]] at the expense of the [[Suebi]] and [[Vandals]]. In 507, however, their rule in Gaul was ended by the [[Franks]] under [[Clovis I]], who defeated them in the [[Battle of Vouill\u00e9]]. After that, the Visigoth kingdom was limited to [[Hispania]], and they never again held territory north of the [[Pyrenees]] other than [[Septimania]]. A small, elite group of Visigoths came to dominate the governance of that region at the expense of those who had previously ruled there, particularly in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] province of [[Spania]] and the [[Kingdom of the Suebi]].\n\nIn or around 589, the Visigoths under [[Reccared I]] converted from [[Arianism]] to [[Nicene Christianity]], gradually adopting the culture of their Hispano-Roman subjects.{{sfn|Claude|1998|pp=119\u2013120}} Their legal code, the ''[[Visigothic Code]]'' (completed in 654) abolished the longstanding practice of applying different laws for Romans and Visigoths. Once legal distinctions were no longer being made between ''Romani'' and ''Gothi'', they became known collectively as ''Hispani''. In the century that followed, the region was dominated by the [[Councils of Toledo]] and the episcopacy. Little else is known about the Visigoths history during the 7th century, since records are relatively sparse. In 711 or 712, an [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|invading force of Arabs and Berbers]] defeated the Visigoths in the [[Battle of Guadalete]]. Their king, [[Roderic]], and many members of their governing elite were killed, and their kingdom rapidly collapsed. The only effective resistance was in Asturias, where a Visigothic nobleman named Pelagius ([[Pelagius of Asturias|Pelayo]]) revolted in 718, and defeated the Muslims at the [[battle of Covadonga]]; this was the beginning of the Reconquest. Pelayo collaborated the [[Astures]], while some Visigoth Nobles and some Visigoth population went to the North of Hispania and took refuge in Asturias, fleeing the Muslim conquest, and joined Pelayo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dbe.rah.es/biografias/4725/pelayo|title=Pelayo|last=Ruiz de la Pe\u00f1a Solar|first=Juan Ignacio|date=|website=Real Academia de la Historia (Royal Academy of History).Espa\u00f1a/Spain|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=22 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Covadonga|title=Covadonga|last=Navarro Villoslada|first=F.|date=1857|website=Wikisource|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=August 26, 2017|access-date=April 22, 2020}}</ref> F.

They also left many artifacts, which have been discovered in increasing numbers by archaeologists in recent times. The [[Treasure of Guarrazar]] of [[votive crown]]s and crosses is the most spectacular. They founded the only new cities in western Europe from the fall of the Western half of the Roman Empire until the rise of the [[Carolingian dynasty]]. Many Visigothic names are still in use in modern [[List of Spanish words of Germanic origin#Names|Spanish]] and [[List of Portuguese words of Germanic origin#Names|Portuguese]]. Their most notable legacy, however, was the ''[[Visigothic Code]]'', which served, among other things, as the basis for court procedure in most of Christian [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] until the [[Late Middle Ages]], centuries after the demise of the kingdom.\n\n==Nomenclature: Vesi, Tervingi, Visigoths==\nThe Visigoths are never called Visigoths, only Goths, until [[Cassiodorus]] used the term, when referring to their loss against [[Clovis I]] in 507. Cassiodorus apparently invented the term based on the model of the \"[[Ostrogoths]]\", but using the older name of the Vesi, one of the tribal names which the 5th century poet [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] used when referring to the Visigoths.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|p=219}}{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} The first part of the Ostrogoth name is related to the word \"east\", and Jordanes later clearly stated in his ''Getica'' that \"Visigoths were the Goths of the western country.\"{{sfn|Jordanes|1915|p=74 [XIV.82]}} According to Wolfram, Cassiodorus created this east-west understanding of the Goths, which was a simplification and literary device, while political realities were more complex.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} Cassiodorus himself used the term \"Goths\" to refer only to the Ostrogoths, whom he served, and reserved the geographical term \"Visigoths\" for the Gallo-Spanish Goths. In contrast, the term \"Visigoths\" was later used by the Visigoths themselves in their communications with the [[Byzantine Empire]] and was still in use in the 7th century.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}}\n\nTwo older tribal names from outside the Roman empire are associated with Visigoths who formed within the empire. The first references to any Gothic tribes by Roman and Greek authors were in the 3rd century, notably including the [[Thervingi]], who were once referred to as Goths by [[Ammianus Marcellinus]].{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pp=207\u2013212}} Much less is known of the \"Vesi\" or \"Visi\", from whom the name \"Visigoths\" derives. Before Sidonius Apollinaris, the Vesi were first mentioned in the ''[[Notitia Dignitatum]]'', a late 4th or early 5th century list of Roman military forces. This list also contains the last mention of the \"[[Thervingi]]\" in a classical source.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pp=207\u2013212}}\n\nAlthough he did not refer to the Tervingi or Greuthungi, the medieval writer [[Jordanes]] identified the Visigoth (Vesi) kings from [[Alaric I]] to [[Alaric II]] as the successors of the 4th century Tervingian king [[Athanaric]], and the Ostrogoth kings from [[Theoderic the Great]] to [[Theodahad]] as the heirs of the Greuthungi king [[Ermanaric]].{{sfn|Heather|1998|pp=300\u2013301}}. Based on this, many scholars have traditionally treated the terms \"Vesi\" and \"Tervingi\" as referring to one particular tribe, while the terms \"Ostrogothi\" and \"[[Greuthungi]]\" were used to refer to another.{{sfn|Heather|1999|pp=43\u201344}}\n\nWolfram, who still recently defends the equation of Vesi with the Tervingi, argues that while primary sources occasionally list all four names (as in, for example, ''Gruthungi, Austrogothi, Tervingi, Visi''), whenever they mention two different tribes, they always refer either to \"the Vesi and the Ostrogothi\" or to \"the Tervingi and the Greuthungi\", and they never pair them up in any other combination. In addition, Wolfram interprets the ''[[Notitia Dignitatum]]'' as equating the Vesi with the Tervingi in a reference to the years 388\u2013391.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=24\u201325}} On the other hand, another other recent interpretation of the ''Notitia'' is that the two names, Vesi and Tervingi, are found in different places in the list, \"a clear indication that we are dealing with two different army units, which must also presumably mean that they are, after all, perceived as two different peoples\".{{sfn|Christensen|2002|p=219}} Peter Heather has written that Wolfram's position is \"entirely arguable, but so is the opposite\".{{sfn|Heather|1999|p=75}}\n\n[[File:Gutthiuda.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|right|Gutthiuda{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}]]\n\nWolfram believes that \"Vesi\" and \"Ostrogothi\" were terms each tribe used to boastfully describe itself and argues that \"Tervingi\" and \"Greuthungi\" were geographical identifiers each tribe used to describe the other.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} This would explain why the latter terms dropped out of use shortly after 400, when the Goths were displaced by the [[Huns#Before Attila|Hunnic invasions]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=24}} Wolfram believes that the people Zosimus describes were those Tervingi who had remained behind after the Hunnic conquest.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=387, fn57}} For the most part, all of the terms discriminating between different Gothic tribes gradually disappeared after they moved into the Roman Empire.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} \n\nMany recent scholars, such as [[Peter Heather]], have concluded that Visigothic group identity emerged only within the Roman Empire.{{sfn|Heather|1998|pp=52\u201357, 130\u2013178, 302\u2013309}} [[Roger Collins]] also believes that the Visigothic identity emerged from the [[Gothic War (376\u2013382)|Gothic War of 376\u2013382]] when a collection of Tervingi, Greuthungi, and other \"barbarian\" contingents banded together in multiethnic ''[[foederati]]'' (Wolfram's \"federate armies\") under Alaric I in the eastern [[Balkans]], since they had become a multi ethnic group and could no longer claim to be exclusively Tervingian.{{sfn|Collins|2004|pp=22\u201324}}\n\nOther names for other Gothic divisions abounded. In 469, the Visigoths were called the \"Alaric Goths\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} The [[Frankish Table of Nations]], probably of Byzantine or Italian origin, referred to one of the two peoples as the ''Walagothi'', meaning \"Roman Goths\" (from Germanic *''[[walhaz]]'', foreign). This probably refers to the Romanized Visigoths after their entry into Spain.{{sfn|Goffart|1983|pp=125\u2013126}} [[Landolfus Sagax]], writing in the 10th or 11th century, calls the Visigoths the ''Hypogothi''.{{sfn|Friedrich|1910|p=14}}\n\n===Etymology of Tervingi and Vesi/Visigothi===\nThe name ''Tervingi'' may mean \"forest people\", with the first part of the name related to Gothic ''triu'', and English \"tree\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} This is supported by evidence that geographic descriptors were commonly used to distinguish people living north of the [[Black Sea]] both before and after Gothic settlement there, by evidence of forest-related names among the Tervingi, and by the lack of evidence for an earlier date for the name pair Tervingi\u2013Greuthungi than the late 3rd century.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=387\u2013388, fn58}} That the name ''Tervingi'' has pre-Pontic, possibly Scandinavian, origins still has support today.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=387, fn58}}\n\nThe Visigoths are called ''Wesi'' or ''Wisi'' by [[Trebellius Pollio]], Claudian, and Sidonius Apollinaris.{{sfn|Stevenson|1899|p=36, fn15}} The word is [[Gothic language|Gothic]] for \"good\", implying the \"good or worthy people\",{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} related to Gothic ''iusiza'' \"better\" and a reflex of [[Proto Indo-European Language|Indo-European]] *''wesu'' \"good\", akin to [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''gwiw'' \"excellent\", [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] ''eus'' \"good\", [[Sanskrit]] ''v\u00e1su-\u015f'' \"id.\".

Eventually the Gothic language died as a result of contact with other European people during the [[Middle Ages]].{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=844}}\n\nLong struggles between the neighboring Vandili and Lugii people with the Goths may have contributed to their earlier exodus into mainland Europe. The vast majority of them settled between the [[Oder]] and [[Vistula]] rivers until overpopulation (according to Gothic legends or tribal sagas) forced them to move south and east, where they settled just north of the [[Black Sea]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=42\u201343}} However, this legend is not supported by archaeological evidence so its validity is disputable. Historian Malcolm Todd contends that while this large ''en masse'' migration is possible, the movement of Gothic peoples south-east was more likely the result of warrior bands moving closer to the wealth of [[Ukraine]] and the cities of the Black Sea coast. Perhaps what is most notable about the Gothic people in this regard was that by the middle of the 3rd century AD, they were \"the most formidable military power beyond the lower Danube frontier\".{{sfn|Todd|2000|pp=149\u2013150}}{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=42\u201355}}\n\n====Contact with Rome====\n[[File:Tezaurul de la Pietroasele Closca MNIR Tezaur.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Pietroasele Treasure]] discovered in Romania, attributed to the Visigoths{{sfn|Odobescu|1889|p=1-100}}]]\nThroughout the third and fourth centuries there were numerous conflicts and exchanges of varying types between the Goths and their neighbors. After the Romans withdrew from the territory of Dacia, the local population was subjected to constant invasions by the migratory tribes, among the first being the Goths.{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|p=11}} In 238, the Goths invaded across the Danube into the Roman province of [[Moesia]], pillaging and exacting payment through hostage taking. During the war with the Persians that year, Goths also appeared in the Roman armies of [[Gordian III]].{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=150}} When subsidies to the Goths were stopped, the Goths organized and in 250 joined a major barbarian invasion led by the Germanic king, Kniva.{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=150}} Success on the battlefield against the Romans inspired additional invasions into the northern [[Balkans]] and deeper into [[Anatolia]].{{sfn|Todd|2000|pp=150\u2013151}} Starting in approximately 255, the Goths added a new dimension to their attacks by taking to the sea and invading harbors which brought them into conflict with the Greeks as well. When the city of [[Pityus]] fell to the Goths in 256, the Goths were further emboldened. Sometime between 266\u2013267, the Goths raided Greece but when they attempted to move into the Bosporus straits to attack Byzantium, they were repulsed. Along with other Germanic tribes, they attacked further into Anatolia, assaulting Crete and Cyprus on the way; shortly thereafter, they pillaged Troy and the temple of Artemis at Ephesus.{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=151}} Throughout the reign of emperor [[Constantine the Great]], the Visigoths continued to conduct raids on Roman territory south of the Danube River.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=844}} By 332, relations between the Goths and Romans were stabilized by a treaty but this was not to last.{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=152}}\n\n===War with Rome (376\u2013382)===\n{{Main|Gothic War (376\u2013382)}}\nThe Goths remained in [[Dacia]] until 376, when one of their leaders, [[Fritigern]], appealed to the Roman emperor [[Valens]] to be allowed to settle with his people on the south bank of the [[Danube River|Danube]]. Here, they hoped to find refuge from the [[Huns]].{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|pp=844\u2013845}} Valens permitted this, as he saw in them \"a splendid recruiting ground for his army\".{{sfn|Fuller|1998|p=55}} However, a [[famine]] broke out and Rome was unwilling to supply them with either the food they were promised or the land. Generally, the Goths were abused by the Romans,{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=845}} who began forcing the now starving Goths to trade away their children so as to stave off starvation.{{sfn|Durant|1950|p=24}} Open revolt ensued, leading to 6 years of plundering throughout the Balkans, the death of a Roman Emperor and a disastrous defeat of the Roman army.{{sfn|Durant|1950|pp=24\u201325}}\n\nThe [[Battle of Adrianople (378)|Battle of Adrianople]] in 378 was the decisive moment of the war.

Fourth-century Roman soldier and historian [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] ended his chronology of Roman history with this battle.{{sfn|Katz|1955|pp=88\u201389}}\n\nDespite the severe consequences for Rome, Adrianople was not nearly as productive overall for the Visigoths and their gains were short-lived. Still confined to a small and relatively impoverished province of the Empire, another Roman army was being gathered against them, an army which also had amid its ranks other disaffected Goths.{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=154}} Intense campaigns against the Visigoths followed their victory at Adrianople for upwards of three years. Approach routes across the Danube provinces were effectively sealed off by concerted Roman efforts, and while there was no decisive victory to claim, it was essentially a Roman triumph ending in a treaty in 382. The treaty struck with the Goths was to be the first ''foedus'' on imperial Roman soil. It required these semi-autonomous Germanic tribes to raise troops for the Roman army in exchange for arable land and freedom from Roman legal structures within the Empire.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=179\u2013180}}{{Efn|Other sources dispute the contents of the supposed \"treaty\" and claim it was a Gothic surrender.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=180\u2013181}} }}\n\n===Reign of Alaric I===\n[[File:Alaric entering Athens.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|right|An illustration of [[Alaric I|Alaric]] entering [[Athens]] in 395]]\n{{Main|Alaric I}}\nThe new emperor, [[Theodosius I]], made peace with the rebels, and this peace held essentially unbroken until Theodosius died in 395.{{sfn|Burns|2003|pp=322, 374}} In that year, the Visigoths' most famous king, [[Alaric I]], made a bid for the throne, but controversy and intrigue erupted between the East and West, as General [[Stilicho]] tried to maintain his position in the empire.{{sfn|Heather|2013|pp=153\u2013160}} Theodosius was succeeded by his incompetent sons: [[Arcadius]] in the east and [[Flavius Augustus Honorius|Honorius]] in the west.

He resolved to cut the city off by capturing its port. On August 24, 410, however, Alaric's troops entered Rome through the [[Salarian Gate]], and [[sack of Rome (410)|sacked the city]].{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=214\u2013217}} However, Rome, while still the official capital, was no longer the ''de facto'' seat of the government of the Western Roman Empire. From the late 370s up to 402, [[Milan]] was the seat of government, but after the siege of Milan the Imperial Court moved to [[Ravenna]] in 402. Honorius visited Rome often, and after his death in 423 the emperors resided mostly there. Rome's fall severely shook the Empire's confidence, especially in the West. Loaded with booty, Alaric and the Visigoths extracted as much as they could with the intention of leaving Italy from Basilicata to northern [[Africa]]. Alaric died before the disembarkation and was buried supposedly near the ruins of Croton.

For a brief period, the Visigoths controlled the strongest kingdom in Western Europe.{{sfn|Williams|2004|p=51}} In response to the invasion of [[Hispania|Roman Hispania]] of 409 by the [[Vandals]], [[Alans]] and [[Suebi]], [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]], the emperor in the West, enlisted the aid of the Visigoths to regain control of the territory. From 408 to 410 the Visigoths caused so much damage to Rome and the immediate periphery that nearly a decade later, the provinces in and around the city were only able to contribute one-seventh of their previous tax shares.{{sfn|Heather|2005|p=434}}\n\nIn 418, Honorius rewarded his Visigothic [[foederati|federates]] by giving them land in [[Gallia Aquitania]] on which to settle after they had attacked the four tribes \u2013 Sueves, Asding and Siling Vandala and Alans \u2013 who had crossed the Rhine near Mainz the last day of 409 and eventually were invited into Spain by a Roman usurper in the Fall of 409 (the latter two tribes were devastated). This was probably done under ''hospitalitas'', the rules for billeting army soldiers.{{sfn|Sivan|1987|pp=759\u2013772}} The settlement formed the nucleus of the future Visigothic kingdom that would eventually expand across the [[Pyrenees]] and onto the Iberian peninsula. That Visigothic settlement proved paramount to Europe's future as had it not been for the Visigothic warriors who fought side-by-side with the Roman troops under general [[Flavius Aetius]], it is perhaps possible that [[Attila]] would have seized control of Gaul, rather than the Romans being able to retain dominance.{{sfn|Burns|2003|p=382}}\n\nThe Visigoths' second great king, [[Euric]], unified the various quarreling factions among the Visigoths and, in 475, forced the Roman government to come to terms, but the emperor did not legally recognize Gothic sovereignty; instead the emperor was content to be called a friend (''amicus'') to the Visigoths, while requiring them to address him as lord (''dominus'').{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=186\u2013187}} Between 471\u2013476, Euric captured most of southern Gaul.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|p=358}} According to historian J.

Many were farmers, but they worked in a wide range of occupations, and were a major component of the urbanized population of the larger towns particularly of eastern Spain. During the period in which the Visigoths adhered to Arianism, the situation of the Jews seems to have remained relatively good.  Previous Roman and Byzantine law determined their status, and it already sharply discriminated against them, but royal jurisdiction was in any case quite limited: local lords and populations related to Jews as they saw fit. We read of rabbis being asked by non-Jews to bless their fields, for example.{{sfn|Graetz|1894|p=44}} Historian Jane Gerber relates that some of the Jews \"held ranking posts in the government or the army; others were recruited and organized for garrison service; still others continued to hold senatorial rank\".{{sfn|Gerber|1992|p=9}} In general, then, they were well respected and well-treated by the Visigothic kings, that is, until their transition from Arianism to Catholicism.{{sfn|Roth|1994|pp=35\u201340}}\n\nCatholic conversion across Visigothic society reduced much of the friction between their people and the native Spanish population.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=847}} One chief purpose of this conversion was to unify the realm under the Church, and one of the key complaints of the Church had long been that Jews had too much status, prosperity and influence. Local nobles relied on their Jewish and non-Jewish sectors of the population to enhance the local economy and the noble's independent power. Visigothic political structure had traditionally given extensive powers to local nobles (who even elected their kings), so the king was in many ways merely 'the first amongst equals,' and central authority was weak. The status of the Jews therefore impacted local aristocrats both symbolically and politically.\n\nKing Reccared convened the Third Council of Toledo to settle religious disputations related to the religious conversion from Arianism to Catholicism.{{sfn|Collins|1999|pp=211\u2013212}} The discriminatory laws passed at this Council seem not to have been universally enforced, however, as indicated by several more Councils of Toledo that repeated these laws and extended their stringency.  These entered canon law and became legal precedents in other parts of Europe as well.  The culmination of this process occurred under King Sisibut, who decreed a forced Christian conversion upon all Jews in Spain.{{sfn|Collins|2000|p=60}} This mandate apparently achieved only partial success: similar decrees were repeated by later kings as central power was consolidated. These laws either prescribed forcible baptism of the Jews or forbade circumcision, Jewish rites, and the observance of the Sabbath and other festivals. Throughout the seventh century, Jews were flogged, executed, had their property confiscated, were subjected to ruinous taxes, forbidden to trade and, at times, dragged to the baptismal font. Many were obliged to accept Christianity but continued privately to observe the Jewish religion and practices.{{sfn|Gonzalez-Salinero|1999|pp=140\u2013147}} The decree of 613 set off a century of torment for Spanish Jewry, which was only ended by the Muslim conquest.{{Efn|Cf. the extensive accounts of Visigothic Jewish history by Heinrich Graetz, ''History of the Jews'', Vol. 3 (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1956 reprint [1894]), pp. 43\u201352 (on Sisibut, pp. 47\u201349); Salo W.

With the conversion of the Visigothic kings to [[Chalcedonian Christianity]], the bishops increased their power, until, at the [[Fourth Council of Toledo]] in 633, they selected a king from among the royal family, a practice previously reserved for nobles. This was the same synod that declared that all Jews must be [[baptism|baptised]].

The Visigoths emerged from earlier Gothic groups, including a large group of [[Thervingi]], who had moved into the Roman Empire beginning in 376 and had played a major role in defeating the Romans at the [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378.{{sfn|Heather|1998|pp=52\u201357, 300\u2013301}} Relations between the Romans and the Visigoths were variable, alternately warring with one another and making treaties when convenient.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=843}} Under their first leader [[Alaric I]] they invaded Italy and [[sack of Rome (410)|sacked Rome in 410]]. Afterwards, they began settling down, first in southern [[Gaul]] and eventually in [[Hispania]], where they founded the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] and maintained a presence from the 5th to the 8th centuries AD.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|pp=843\u2013844}}\n\nThe Visigoths first settled in southern Gaul as ''[[foederati]]'' to the Romans, a relationship established in 418. However, they soon fell out with their Roman hosts (for reasons that are now obscure) and established their own kingdom with its [[Capital city|capital]] at [[Toulouse]]. They next extended their authority into [[Hispania]] at the expense of the [[Suebi]] and [[Vandals]]. In 507, however, their rule in Gaul was ended by the [[Franks]] under [[Clovis I]], who defeated them in the [[Battle of Vouill\u00e9]]. After that, the Visigoth kingdom was limited to [[Hispania]], and they never again held territory north of the [[Pyrenees]] other than [[Septimania]]. A small, elite group of Visigoths came to dominate the governance of that region at the expense of those who had previously ruled there, particularly in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] province of [[Spania]] and the [[Kingdom of the Suebi]].\n\nIn or around 589, the Visigoths under [[Reccared I]] converted from [[Arianism]] to [[Nicene Christianity]], gradually adopting the culture of their Hispano-Roman subjects.{{sfn|Claude|1998|pp=119\u2013120}} Their legal code, the ''[[Visigothic Code]]'' (completed in 654) abolished the longstanding practice of applying different laws for Romans and Visigoths. Once legal distinctions were no longer being made between ''Romani'' and ''Gothi'', they became known collectively as ''Hispani''. In the century that followed, the region was dominated by the [[Councils of Toledo]] and the episcopacy. Little else is known about the Visigoths history during the 7th century, since records are relatively sparse. In 711 or 712, an [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|invading force of Arabs and Berbers]] defeated the Visigoths in the [[Battle of Guadalete]]. Their king, [[Roderic]], and many members of their governing elite were killed, and their kingdom rapidly collapsed. The only effective resistance was in Asturias, where a Visigothic nobleman named Pelagius ([[Pelagius of Asturias|Pelayo]]) revolted in 718, and defeated the Muslims at the [[battle of Covadonga]]; this was the beginning of the Reconquest. Pelayo collaborated the [[Astures]], while some Visigoth Nobles and some Visigoth population went to the North of Hispania and took refuge in Asturias, fleeing the Muslim conquest, and joined Pelayo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dbe.rah.es/biografias/4725/pelayo|title=Pelayo|last=Ruiz de la Pe\u00f1a Solar|first=Juan Ignacio|date=|website=Real Academia de la Historia (Royal Academy of History).Espa\u00f1a/Spain|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=22 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Covadonga|title=Covadonga|last=Navarro Villoslada|first=F.|date=1857|website=Wikisource|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=August 26, 2017|access-date=April 22, 2020}}</ref> F.

They also left many artifacts, which have been discovered in increasing numbers by archaeologists in recent times. The [[Treasure of Guarrazar]] of [[votive crown]]s and crosses is the most spectacular. They founded the only new cities in western Europe from the fall of the Western half of the Roman Empire until the rise of the [[Carolingian dynasty]]. Many Visigothic names are still in use in modern [[List of Spanish words of Germanic origin#Names|Spanish]] and [[List of Portuguese words of Germanic origin#Names|Portuguese]]. Their most notable legacy, however, was the ''[[Visigothic Code]]'', which served, among other things, as the basis for court procedure in most of Christian [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] until the [[Late Middle Ages]], centuries after the demise of the kingdom.\n\n==Nomenclature: Vesi, Tervingi, Visigoths==\nThe Visigoths are never called Visigoths, only Goths, until [[Cassiodorus]] used the term, when referring to their loss against [[Clovis I]] in 507. Cassiodorus apparently invented the term based on the model of the \"[[Ostrogoths]]\", but using the older name of the Vesi, one of the tribal names which the 5th century poet [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] used when referring to the Visigoths.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|p=219}}{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} The first part of the Ostrogoth name is related to the word \"east\", and Jordanes later clearly stated in his ''Getica'' that \"Visigoths were the Goths of the western country.\"{{sfn|Jordanes|1915|p=74 [XIV.82]}} According to Wolfram, Cassiodorus created this east-west understanding of the Goths, which was a simplification and literary device, while political realities were more complex.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} Cassiodorus himself used the term \"Goths\" to refer only to the Ostrogoths, whom he served, and reserved the geographical term \"Visigoths\" for the Gallo-Spanish Goths. In contrast, the term \"Visigoths\" was later used by the Visigoths themselves in their communications with the [[Byzantine Empire]] and was still in use in the 7th century.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}}\n\nTwo older tribal names from outside the Roman empire are associated with Visigoths who formed within the empire. The first references to any Gothic tribes by Roman and Greek authors were in the 3rd century, notably including the [[Thervingi]], who were once referred to as Goths by [[Ammianus Marcellinus]].{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pp=207\u2013212}} Much less is known of the \"Vesi\" or \"Visi\", from whom the name \"Visigoths\" derives. Before Sidonius Apollinaris, the Vesi were first mentioned in the ''[[Notitia Dignitatum]]'', a late 4th or early 5th century list of Roman military forces. This list also contains the last mention of the \"[[Thervingi]]\" in a classical source.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pp=207\u2013212}}\n\nAlthough he did not refer to the Tervingi or Greuthungi, the medieval writer [[Jordanes]] identified the Visigoth (Vesi) kings from [[Alaric I]] to [[Alaric II]] as the successors of the 4th century Tervingian king [[Athanaric]], and the Ostrogoth kings from [[Theoderic the Great]] to [[Theodahad]] as the heirs of the Greuthungi king [[Ermanaric]].{{sfn|Heather|1998|pp=300\u2013301}}. Based on this, many scholars have traditionally treated the terms \"Vesi\" and \"Tervingi\" as referring to one particular tribe, while the terms \"Ostrogothi\" and \"[[Greuthungi]]\" were used to refer to another.{{sfn|Heather|1999|pp=43\u201344}}\n\nWolfram, who still recently defends the equation of Vesi with the Tervingi, argues that while primary sources occasionally list all four names (as in, for example, ''Gruthungi, Austrogothi, Tervingi, Visi''), whenever they mention two different tribes, they always refer either to \"the Vesi and the Ostrogothi\" or to \"the Tervingi and the Greuthungi\", and they never pair them up in any other combination. In addition, Wolfram interprets the ''[[Notitia Dignitatum]]'' as equating the Vesi with the Tervingi in a reference to the years 388\u2013391.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=24\u201325}} On the other hand, another other recent interpretation of the ''Notitia'' is that the two names, Vesi and Tervingi, are found in different places in the list, \"a clear indication that we are dealing with two different army units, which must also presumably mean that they are, after all, perceived as two different peoples\".{{sfn|Christensen|2002|p=219}} Peter Heather has written that Wolfram's position is \"entirely arguable, but so is the opposite\".{{sfn|Heather|1999|p=75}}\n\n[[File:Gutthiuda.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|right|Gutthiuda{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}]]\n\nWolfram believes that \"Vesi\" and \"Ostrogothi\" were terms each tribe used to boastfully describe itself and argues that \"Tervingi\" and \"Greuthungi\" were geographical identifiers each tribe used to describe the other.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} This would explain why the latter terms dropped out of use shortly after 400, when the Goths were displaced by the [[Huns#Before Attila|Hunnic invasions]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=24}} Wolfram believes that the people Zosimus describes were those Tervingi who had remained behind after the Hunnic conquest.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=387, fn57}} For the most part, all of the terms discriminating between different Gothic tribes gradually disappeared after they moved into the Roman Empire.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} \n\nMany recent scholars, such as [[Peter Heather]], have concluded that Visigothic group identity emerged only within the Roman Empire.{{sfn|Heather|1998|pp=52\u201357, 130\u2013178, 302\u2013309}} [[Roger Collins]] also believes that the Visigothic identity emerged from the [[Gothic War (376\u2013382)|Gothic War of 376\u2013382]] when a collection of Tervingi, Greuthungi, and other \"barbarian\" contingents banded together in multiethnic ''[[foederati]]'' (Wolfram's \"federate armies\") under Alaric I in the eastern [[Balkans]], since they had become a multi ethnic group and could no longer claim to be exclusively Tervingian.{{sfn|Collins|2004|pp=22\u201324}}\n\nOther names for other Gothic divisions abounded. In 469, the Visigoths were called the \"Alaric Goths\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} The [[Frankish Table of Nations]], probably of Byzantine or Italian origin, referred to one of the two peoples as the ''Walagothi'', meaning \"Roman Goths\" (from Germanic *''[[walhaz]]'', foreign). This probably refers to the Romanized Visigoths after their entry into Spain.{{sfn|Goffart|1983|pp=125\u2013126}} [[Landolfus Sagax]], writing in the 10th or 11th century, calls the Visigoths the ''Hypogothi''.{{sfn|Friedrich|1910|p=14}}\n\n===Etymology of Tervingi and Vesi/Visigothi===\nThe name ''Tervingi'' may mean \"forest people\", with the first part of the name related to Gothic ''triu'', and English \"tree\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} This is supported by evidence that geographic descriptors were commonly used to distinguish people living north of the [[Black Sea]] both before and after Gothic settlement there, by evidence of forest-related names among the Tervingi, and by the lack of evidence for an earlier date for the name pair Tervingi\u2013Greuthungi than the late 3rd century.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=387\u2013388, fn58}} That the name ''Tervingi'' has pre-Pontic, possibly Scandinavian, origins still has support today.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=387, fn58}}\n\nThe Visigoths are called ''Wesi'' or ''Wisi'' by [[Trebellius Pollio]], Claudian, and Sidonius Apollinaris.{{sfn|Stevenson|1899|p=36, fn15}} The word is [[Gothic language|Gothic]] for \"good\", implying the \"good or worthy people\",{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} related to Gothic ''iusiza'' \"better\" and a reflex of [[Proto Indo-European Language|Indo-European]] *''wesu'' \"good\", akin to [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''gwiw'' \"excellent\", [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] ''eus'' \"good\", [[Sanskrit]] ''v\u00e1su-\u015f'' \"id.\". Jordanes relates the tribe's name to a river, though this is most likely a [[folk etymology]] or legend like his similar story about the Greuthung name.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=387, fn58}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Visigoth migrations.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.35|Migrations of the main column of the Visigoths]]\n\n===Early origins===\nThe Visigoths emerged from the Gothic tribes, most likely a derivative name for the [[Gutones]], a people believed to have their origins in [[Scandinavia]] and who migrated southeastwards into eastern Europe.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=39\u201340}} Such understanding of their origins is largely the result of Gothic traditions and their true genesis as a people is as obscure as that of the [[Franks]] and [[Alamanni]].{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=149}} The Visigoths spoke an eastern Germanic language that was distinct by the 4th century. Eventually the Gothic language died as a result of contact with other European people during the [[Middle Ages]].{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=844}}\n\nLong struggles between the neighboring Vandili and Lugii people with the Goths may have contributed to their earlier exodus into mainland Europe. The vast majority of them settled between the [[Oder]] and [[Vistula]] rivers until overpopulation (according to Gothic legends or tribal sagas) forced them to move south and east, where they settled just north of the [[Black Sea]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=42\u201343}} However, this legend is not supported by archaeological evidence so its validity is disputable. Historian Malcolm Todd contends that while this large ''en masse'' migration is possible, the movement of Gothic peoples south-east was more likely the result of warrior bands moving closer to the wealth of [[Ukraine]] and the cities of the Black Sea coast. Perhaps what is most notable about the Gothic people in this regard was that by the middle of the 3rd century AD, they were \"the most formidable military power beyond the lower Danube frontier\".{{sfn|Todd|2000|pp=149\u2013150}}{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=42\u201355}}\n\n====Contact with Rome====\n[[File:Tezaurul de la Pietroasele Closca MNIR Tezaur.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Pietroasele Treasure]] discovered in Romania, attributed to the Visigoths{{sfn|Odobescu|1889|p=1-100}}]]\nThroughout the third and fourth centuries there were numerous conflicts and exchanges of varying types between the Goths and their neighbors. After the Romans withdrew from the territory of Dacia, the local population was subjected to constant invasions by the migratory tribes, among the first being the Goths.{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|p=11}} In 238, the Goths invaded across the Danube into the Roman province of [[Moesia]], pillaging and exacting payment through hostage taking. During the war with the Persians that year, Goths also appeared in the Roman armies of [[Gordian III]].{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=150}} When subsidies to the Goths were stopped, the Goths organized and in 250 joined a major barbarian invasion led by the Germanic king, Kniva.{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=150}} Success on the battlefield against the Romans inspired additional invasions into the northern [[Balkans]] and deeper into [[Anatolia]].{{sfn|Todd|2000|pp=150\u2013151}} Starting in approximately 255, the Goths added a new dimension to their attacks by taking to the sea and invading harbors which brought them into conflict with the Greeks as well. When the city of [[Pityus]] fell to the Goths in 256, the Goths were further emboldened. Sometime between 266\u2013267, the Goths raided Greece but when they attempted to move into the Bosporus straits to attack Byzantium, they were repulsed. Along with other Germanic tribes, they attacked further into Anatolia, assaulting Crete and Cyprus on the way; shortly thereafter, they pillaged Troy and the temple of Artemis at Ephesus.{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=151}} Throughout the reign of emperor [[Constantine the Great]], the Visigoths continued to conduct raids on Roman territory south of the Danube River.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=844}} By 332, relations between the Goths and Romans were stabilized by a treaty but this was not to last.{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=152}}\n\n===War with Rome (376\u2013382)===\n{{Main|Gothic War (376\u2013382)}}\nThe Goths remained in [[Dacia]] until 376, when one of their leaders, [[Fritigern]], appealed to the Roman emperor [[Valens]] to be allowed to settle with his people on the south bank of the [[Danube River|Danube]]. Here, they hoped to find refuge from the [[Huns]].{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|pp=844\u2013845}} Valens permitted this, as he saw in them \"a splendid recruiting ground for his army\".{{sfn|Fuller|1998|p=55}} However, a [[famine]] broke out and Rome was unwilling to supply them with either the food they were promised or the land. Generally, the Goths were abused by the Romans,{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=845}} who began forcing the now starving Goths to trade away their children so as to stave off starvation.{{sfn|Durant|1950|p=24}} Open revolt ensued, leading to 6 years of plundering throughout the Balkans, the death of a Roman Emperor and a disastrous defeat of the Roman army.{{sfn|Durant|1950|pp=24\u201325}}\n\nThe [[Battle of Adrianople (378)|Battle of Adrianople]] in 378 was the decisive moment of the war. The Roman forces were slaughtered and the Emperor [[Valens]] was killed during the fighting.{{sfn|Sarris|2002|p=36}} Precisely how Valens fell remains uncertain but Gothic legend tells of how the emperor was taken to a farmhouse, which was set on fire above his head, a tale made more popular by its symbolic representation of a heretical emperor receiving hell's torment.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=178\u2013179}} Many of Rome's leading officers and some of their most elite fighting men died during the battle which struck a major blow to Roman prestige and the Empire's military capabilities.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=179}} Adrianople shocked the Roman world and eventually forced the Romans to negotiate with and settle the tribe within the empire's boundaries, a development with far-reaching consequences for the eventual [[fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall of Rome]]. Fourth-century Roman soldier and historian [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] ended his chronology of Roman history with this battle.{{sfn|Katz|1955|pp=88\u201389}}\n\nDespite the severe consequences for Rome, Adrianople was not nearly as productive overall for the Visigoths and their gains were short-lived. Still confined to a small and relatively impoverished province of the Empire, another Roman army was being gathered against them, an army which also had amid its ranks other disaffected Goths.{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=154}} Intense campaigns against the Visigoths followed their victory at Adrianople for upwards of three years. Approach routes across the Danube provinces were effectively sealed off by concerted Roman efforts, and while there was no decisive victory to claim, it was essentially a Roman triumph ending in a treaty in 382. The treaty struck with the Goths was to be the first ''foedus'' on imperial Roman soil. It required these semi-autonomous Germanic tribes to raise troops for the Roman army in exchange for arable land and freedom from Roman legal structures within the Empire.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=179\u2013180}}{{Efn|Other sources dispute the contents of the supposed \"treaty\" and claim it was a Gothic surrender.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=180\u2013181}} }}\n\n===Reign of Alaric I===\n[[File:Alaric entering Athens.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|right|An illustration of [[Alaric I|Alaric]] entering [[Athens]] in 395]]\n{{Main|Alaric I}}\nThe new emperor, [[Theodosius I]], made peace with the rebels, and this peace held essentially unbroken until Theodosius died in 395.{{sfn|Burns|2003|pp=322, 374}} In that year, the Visigoths' most famous king, [[Alaric I]], made a bid for the throne, but controversy and intrigue erupted between the East and West, as General [[Stilicho]] tried to maintain his position in the empire.{{sfn|Heather|2013|pp=153\u2013160}} Theodosius was succeeded by his incompetent sons: [[Arcadius]] in the east and [[Flavius Augustus Honorius|Honorius]] in the west. In 397, Alaric was named military commander of the eastern Illyrian prefecture by Arcadius.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=845}}\n\nOver the next 15 years, an uneasy peace was broken by occasional conflicts between Alaric and the powerful Germanic generals who commanded the Roman armies in the east and west, wielding the real power of the empire.{{sfn|Heather|2013|pp=183\u2013223}} Finally, after the western general Stilicho was executed by Honorius in 408 and the Roman legions massacred the families of thousands of barbarian soldiers who were trying to assimilate into the Roman empire, Alaric decided to march on Rome.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|pp=204\u2013205}} After two defeats in Northern Italy and a siege of Rome ended by a negotiated pay-off, Alaric was cheated by another Roman faction. He resolved to cut the city off by capturing its port. On August 24, 410, however, Alaric's troops entered Rome through the [[Salarian Gate]], and [[sack of Rome (410)|sacked the city]].{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=214\u2013217}} However, Rome, while still the official capital, was no longer the ''de facto'' seat of the government of the Western Roman Empire. From the late 370s up to 402, [[Milan]] was the seat of government, but after the siege of Milan the Imperial Court moved to [[Ravenna]] in 402. Honorius visited Rome often, and after his death in 423 the emperors resided mostly there. Rome's fall severely shook the Empire's confidence, especially in the West. Loaded with booty, Alaric and the Visigoths extracted as much as they could with the intention of leaving Italy from Basilicata to northern [[Africa]]. Alaric died before the disembarkation and was buried supposedly near the ruins of Croton. He was succeeded by his wife's brother.{{sfn|Collins|1999|pp=63\u201365}}\n\n===Visigothic Kingdom===\n{{Main|Visigothic Kingdom}}\n[[File:Europe and the Near East at 476 AD.png|thumb|upright=1.6|Europe at the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD]]\n\nThe Visigothic Kingdom was a Western European power in the 5th to 7th centuries, created in Gaul when the Romans lost their control of the western half of their empire. For a brief period, the Visigoths controlled the strongest kingdom in Western Europe.{{sfn|Williams|2004|p=51}} In response to the invasion of [[Hispania|Roman Hispania]] of 409 by the [[Vandals]], [[Alans]] and [[Suebi]], [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]], the emperor in the West, enlisted the aid of the Visigoths to regain control of the territory. From 408 to 410 the Visigoths caused so much damage to Rome and the immediate periphery that nearly a decade later, the provinces in and around the city were only able to contribute one-seventh of their previous tax shares.{{sfn|Heather|2005|p=434}}\n\nIn 418, Honorius rewarded his Visigothic [[foederati|federates]] by giving them land in [[Gallia Aquitania]] on which to settle after they had attacked the four tribes \u2013 Sueves, Asding and Siling Vandala and Alans \u2013 who had crossed the Rhine near Mainz the last day of 409 and eventually were invited into Spain by a Roman usurper in the Fall of 409 (the latter two tribes were devastated). This was probably done under ''hospitalitas'', the rules for billeting army soldiers.{{sfn|Sivan|1987|pp=759\u2013772}} The settlement formed the nucleus of the future Visigothic kingdom that would eventually expand across the [[Pyrenees]] and onto the Iberian peninsula. That Visigothic settlement proved paramount to Europe's future as had it not been for the Visigothic warriors who fought side-by-side with the Roman troops under general [[Flavius Aetius]], it is perhaps possible that [[Attila]] would have seized control of Gaul, rather than the Romans being able to retain dominance.{{sfn|Burns|2003|p=382}}\n\nThe Visigoths' second great king, [[Euric]], unified the various quarreling factions among the Visigoths and, in 475, forced the Roman government to come to terms, but the emperor did not legally recognize Gothic sovereignty; instead the emperor was content to be called a friend (''amicus'') to the Visigoths, while requiring them to address him as lord (''dominus'').{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=186\u2013187}} Between 471\u2013476, Euric captured most of southern Gaul.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|p=358}} According to historian J.

It goes into more detail than a modern constitution commonly does and reveals a great deal about Visigothic social structure.{{sfn|Collins|2004|pp=6\u20138}}\n\nOne of the greatest contributions of the Visigoths to [[family law]] was their protection of the property rights of married women, which was continued by [[Law of Spain|Spanish law]] and ultimately evolved into the [[community property]] system now in force throughout the majority of western Europe.{{sfn|Coolidge|2011|pp=17\u201325}}\n\n===Religion===\nBefore the [[Middle Ages]], the Visigoths, as well as other Germanic peoples, followed what is now referred to as [[Germanic paganism]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|pp=58, 66, 72\u201374}} While the Germanic peoples were slowly converted to [[Christianity]] by varying means, many elements of the pre-Christian culture and indigenous beliefs remained firmly in place after the conversion process, particularly in the more rural and distant regions.{{sfn|James|2009|pp=215\u2013225}}\n\nThe Visigoths, [[Ostrogoths]], and [[Vandals]] were [[Christianized]] while they were still outside the bounds of the [[Roman Empire]]; however, they converted to [[Arianism]] rather than to the [[Nicene Christianity|Nicene version]] (Trinitarianism) followed by most Romans, who considered them [[Christian heresy|heretics]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|pp=75\u201379}} There was a religious gulf between the Visigoths, who had for a long time adhered to Arianism, and their Catholic subjects in Hispania. There were also deep sectarian splits among the Catholic population of the peninsula which contributed to the toleration of the Arian Visigoths on the peninsula. The Visigoths scorned to interfere among Catholics but were interested in decorum and public order.{{Efn|At least one high-ranking Visigoth, [[Zerezindo]], ''dux'' of Baetica, was a Catholic in the mid-6th century.}} King [[Liuvigild]] (568\u2013586), attempted to restore political unity between the Visigothic-Arian elite and the Hispano-Roman Nicene Catholic population through a doctrinal settlement of compromise on matters of faith, but this failed.{{sfn|Heather|2013|p=325}} Sources indicate that the Iberian Visigoths maintained their Christian Arianism, especially the Visigothic elite until the end of Liuvigild's reign.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|pp=265\u2013269}} When Reccared I converted to Catholicism, he sought to unify the kingdom under a single faith.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|p=304}}{{sfn|Mathisen|Sivan|1999|p=40}}\n\n[[File:Wisi San Pedro de la Nave e chapiteau a.jpg|thumb|left|Capital from the Visigothic church of [[San Pedro de la Nave]], [[province of Zamora]]]]\n\nWhen the Visigoths took over Spain, [[Jews]] constituted a large and ancient proportion of the population. Many were farmers, but they worked in a wide range of occupations, and were a major component of the urbanized population of the larger towns particularly of eastern Spain. During the period in which the Visigoths adhered to Arianism, the situation of the Jews seems to have remained relatively good.  Previous Roman and Byzantine law determined their status, and it already sharply discriminated against them, but royal jurisdiction was in any case quite limited: local lords and populations related to Jews as they saw fit. We read of rabbis being asked by non-Jews to bless their fields, for example.{{sfn|Graetz|1894|p=44}} Historian Jane Gerber relates that some of the Jews \"held ranking posts in the government or the army; others were recruited and organized for garrison service; still others continued to hold senatorial rank\".{{sfn|Gerber|1992|p=9}} In general, then, they were well respected and well-treated by the Visigothic kings, that is, until their transition from Arianism to Catholicism.{{sfn|Roth|1994|pp=35\u201340}}\n\nCatholic conversion across Visigothic society reduced much of the friction between their people and the native Spanish population.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=847}} One chief purpose of this conversion was to unify the realm under the Church, and one of the key complaints of the Church had long been that Jews had too much status, prosperity and influence. Local nobles relied on their Jewish and non-Jewish sectors of the population to enhance the local economy and the noble's independent power. Visigothic political structure had traditionally given extensive powers to local nobles (who even elected their kings), so the king was in many ways merely 'the first amongst equals,' and central authority was weak. The status of the Jews therefore impacted local aristocrats both symbolically and politically.\n\nKing Reccared convened the Third Council of Toledo to settle religious disputations related to the religious conversion from Arianism to Catholicism.{{sfn|Collins|1999|pp=211\u2013212}} The discriminatory laws passed at this Council seem not to have been universally enforced, however, as indicated by several more Councils of Toledo that repeated these laws and extended their stringency.  These entered canon law and became legal precedents in other parts of Europe as well.  The culmination of this process occurred under King Sisibut, who decreed a forced Christian conversion upon all Jews in Spain.{{sfn|Collins|2000|p=60}} This mandate apparently achieved only partial success: similar decrees were repeated by later kings as central power was consolidated. These laws either prescribed forcible baptism of the Jews or forbade circumcision, Jewish rites, and the observance of the Sabbath and other festivals. Throughout the seventh century, Jews were flogged, executed, had their property confiscated, were subjected to ruinous taxes, forbidden to trade and, at times, dragged to the baptismal font. Many were obliged to accept Christianity but continued privately to observe the Jewish religion and practices.{{sfn|Gonzalez-Salinero|1999|pp=140\u2013147}} The decree of 613 set off a century of torment for Spanish Jewry, which was only ended by the Muslim conquest.{{Efn|Cf. the extensive accounts of Visigothic Jewish history by Heinrich Graetz, ''History of the Jews'', Vol. 3 (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1956 reprint [1894]), pp. 43\u201352 (on Sisibut, pp. 47\u201349); Salo W.

Cohen and D. Sorkin, ''The Oxford Handbook of Jewish Studies'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 156.}}\n\nThe political aspects of the imposition of Church power cannot be ignored in these matters. With the conversion of the Visigothic kings to [[Chalcedonian Christianity]], the bishops increased their power, until, at the [[Fourth Council of Toledo]] in 633, they selected a king from among the royal family, a practice previously reserved for nobles. This was the same synod that declared that all Jews must be [[baptism|baptised]]. As far as the Visigoths were concerned, the time for religious pluralism \"was past\".{{sfn|Lim|1999|pp=209\u2013210}} By the end of the 7th century, Catholic conversion made the Visigoths less distinguishable from the indigenous Roman citizens of the Iberian peninsula; when the last Visigothic strongholds fell to the Muslim armies, whose subsequent invasions transformed Spain from the beginning of the 8th century, their Gothic identity faded.{{sfn|Collins|2000|pp=60\u201362}}\n\nIn the eighth through 11th centuries, the [[muladi|''muwallad'']] clan of the [[Banu Qasi]] claimed descent from the Visigothic [[Count Cassius]].{{sfn|Fletcher|2006|p=45}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Germanic culture}}\n*[[Romano-Germanic culture]]\n*[[Germanic peoples]]\n*[[Arianism]]\n*[[Thiufa]]\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{notelist}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n* {{cite book| last=Arce |first=Javier| chapter=The City of Merida (Emerita) in the Vitas Patrum Emeritensium (Vith Century) | title=East and West, Modes of Communication: Proceedings of the First Plenary Conference at Merida  | editor1=Evangelos Chrysos | editor2=Ian Wood| volume=Vol. 5 [Transformation of the Roman World] | year = 1999| location = Leiden | publisher = Brill | isbn=978-9-00410-929-2|ref = harv}}\n*{{cite book | last=Burns | first=Thomas | year=2003 | title= Rome and the Barbarians, 100 B.C.\u2013A.D. 400 | place= Baltimore, MD | publisher= Johns Hopkins University Press | isbn= 978-0-80187-306-5 | ref = harv}}\n*{{cite book | last=Bury | first=J.

This policy change, enacted with no advance notice, has been highly controversial.  As a result, users who previously relied on Photobucket to freely host content embedded on forums, blogs, and websites must either pay the annual subscription (previously there was no charge), or switch to another 3rd party server (many of which are also shutting down or going to pay services; [[Tinypic]], which remained free under Photobucket ownership, was shut down in 2019) and recreate every link (potentially thousands) for every photo previously linked to Photobucket.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Humphries|first1=Matthew|title=Photobucket Breaks Image Links Across the Internet|url=https://www.pcmag.com/news/354711/photobucket-breaks-image-links-across-the-internet|website=PCMag.com|accessdate=2 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nPhotobucket was founded in 2003 by Alex Welch and Darren Crystal and received funding from Trinity Ventures.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2006/04/19/2-of-us-internet-traffic-through-photobucket/ |title=2% of U.S. Internet Traffic goes through Photobucket}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2006/05/14/photobucket-closes-105-from-trinity-ventures/|title=PhotoBucket Closes $10.5M From Trinity Ventures}}</ref> It was acquired by [[Fox Interactive Media]] in 2007.\n\nIn December 2009, Fox's parent company, [[News Corp (2013\u2013present)|News Corp]], sold Photobucket to Seattle mobile imaging startup Ontela.

The World Wrestling Federation filed an appeal in October 2001. However, on 10 May 2002, the World Wrestling Federation changed its [[Web address]] from ''WWF.com'' to ''WWE.com'', and replaced every \"WWF\" reference on the existing site with \"WWE\", as a prelude to changing the company's name to \"World Wrestling Entertainment.\" Its stock ticker also switched from WWF to WWE.\n\nThe wrestling organization's abandonment of the \"WWF\" [[initialism]] did not end the two organizations' legal conflict. Later in 2002, the World Wide Fund for Nature petitioned the court for $360 million in damages, but was not successful. A subsequent request to overturn by the World Wide Fund for Nature was dismissed by the British [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] on 28 June 2007. In 2003, World Wrestling Entertainment won a limited decision which permitted them to continue marketing certain pre-existing products with the abandoned WWF logo. However, WWE was mandated to issue newly branded merchandise such as apparel, action figures, video games, and [[DVD]]s with the \"WWE\" initials. Additionally, the court order required the company to remove both auditory and visual references to \"WWF\" in its library of video footage outside the United Kingdom.\n\nStarting with the 1,000th episode of ''Raw'' in July 2012, the WWF \"scratch\" logo is no longer censored in archival footage. In addition, the WWF initials are no longer censored when spoken or when written in plain text in archival footage.

The World Wrestling Federation filed an appeal in October 2001. However, on 10 May 2002, the World Wrestling Federation changed its [[Web address]] from ''WWF.com'' to ''WWE.com'', and replaced every \"WWF\" reference on the existing site with \"WWE\", as a prelude to changing the company's name to \"World Wrestling Entertainment.\" Its stock ticker also switched from WWF to WWE.\n\nThe wrestling organization's abandonment of the \"WWF\" [[initialism]] did not end the two organizations' legal conflict. Later in 2002, the World Wide Fund for Nature petitioned the court for $360 million in damages, but was not successful. A subsequent request to overturn by the World Wide Fund for Nature was dismissed by the British [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] on 28 June 2007. In 2003, World Wrestling Entertainment won a limited decision which permitted them to continue marketing certain pre-existing products with the abandoned WWF logo. However, WWE was mandated to issue newly branded merchandise such as apparel, action figures, video games, and [[DVD]]s with the \"WWE\" initials.

by [[Hanna-Barbera]] which aired on [[NBC]] from September 8, 1979 to December 1, 1979.<ref name=Woolery>{{cite book |last1=Woolery |first1=George W. |title=Children's Television: The First

|page=108}}</ref>\n\nThe series contained the following two segments:\n\n*''[[The New Fred and Barney Show]]'' (a revival of ''The Flintstones'') \u2013 one episode, 30 minutes\n*''The Thing'' (based on the [[Marvel Comics]] superhero [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]) \u2013 two episodes, 11 minutes each\n \nDespite the show's title, the two segments remained separate and did not crossover with one another. The characters of [[Fred Flintstone]], [[Barney Rubble]] and [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] were only featured together during the opening title sequence and in brief bumpers between segments.<ref name=Daytime>{{cite book |last1=Hyatt |first1=Wesley |title=The Encyclopedia of Daytime Television |date=1997 |publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications |isbn=978-0823083152 |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofda00hyat/page/160/mode/2up|accessdate=19 March 2020|page=160}}</ref> The unusual combination of a Marvel superhero and ''The Flintstones'' was possible because, at this time, [[Marvel Comics]] owned the rights to several Hanna-Barbera franchises and were, in fact, publishing comic books based upon them; ''The Flintstones'' was one of these.\n\nFor the 1979\u201380 season, the series was expanded to a 90-minute timeslot with the addition of ''[[The New Shmoo]]'' episodes and broadcast under the new title '''''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Shmoo]]'''''.\n\nLike many animated series created by Hanna-Barbera in the 1970s, the show contained a [[Laugh track#Making their own|laugh track]], one of their last productions to do so.\n\n==The Thing==\nThe first segment, a very loose adaptation of [[Marvel Comics]]' character the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], consisted of stories following the adventures of a scrawny, red-headed teenager named Benjy Grimm (voiced by Wayne Morton)<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |page=210}}</ref> who changes into the monstrous and mighty Thing (voiced by Joe Baker) by touching together two magic rings and reciting the words \"Thing Ring, do your thing!\", releasing an explosion of energy that causes orange rocks to hurl in from every direction and transform him into the stone-skinned superhero. When the Thing spoke, his good-naturedly gruff [[Brooklyn]]-accented voice was based on that of comedian [[Jimmy Durante]].\n\nThe stories centered mostly around Benjy at Centerville High School with his friends, the beautiful brunette Betty Harkness (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]), her snooty rich boyfriend Ronald Radford (voiced by [[John Erwin]]), and Betty's blond [[tomboy]] younger sister Kelly (voiced by Noelle North), with minimal adult supervision provided by teacher Miss Twilly (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]). Only Kelly and her scientist father Dr. Harkness (voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]]) know Benjy's secret identity.\n\nWhen not battling various [[mad scientist]]s and getting involved in [[Scooby-Doo]]-style mysteries, the Thing spent most of his time using his superhuman strength to protect his pals from everyday dangers and the nasty [[practical joke]]s of leather-clad bully Spike (voiced by [[Art Metrano]]) and his biker buddies Stretch and Turkey in the [[Yancy Street Gang]].\n \nOther members of the [[Fantastic Four]] did not appear in the show, and the portrayal of the Thing and his origin story differed greatly from the original comics.<ref>{{cite news|title= Fantastic Four on TV|newspaper= [[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/797/797130p2.html|accessdate=September 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\nTwenty-six 11-minute episodes of ''The Thing'' were produced; two shorts aired per show.\n\n''The Thing'' segments are owned by [[WarnerMedia]], through [[Hanna-Barbera]], [[Warner Bros. Animation]] and [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment]], but the character is owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]] due to their purchase of Marvel Comics in late 2009.\n\n===Other appearances===\nIn ''[[Future Foundation|FF]]'' #8,

The entire pastry is then deep-fried in vegetable oil or rarely [[ghee]] to a golden brown color. It is served hot and is often eaten with fresh green chutney, such as mint, [[coriander]], or [[tamarind]]. It can also be prepared as a sweet form, rather than as a savoury one. Samosas are often served in ''[[chaat]]'', along with the traditional accompaniments of either chick pea or white pea preparation, garnished with yogurt, tamarind and green chutney, chopped onions, coriander, and ''[[chaat masala]]''\n\nIn [[Delhi]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Bihar]], and [[Uttarakhand]], a bigger version of the samosa with a spicy filling of masala potatoes, peas, crushed green chillies, cheese, and even dried fruits, as well as other variations, is quite popular. This samosa is bigger compared to other Indian and foreign variants.\n\nIn [[Odisha]], [[West Bengal]], and [[Jharkhand]], ''shingadas'' (the East Indian version of samosas) are popular snacks. They are found almost everywhere. They are a bit smaller compared to those in other parts of India, and the filling mainly consists of boiled and diced potato, along with of other ingredients. They are wrapped in a thin sheet of dough (made of all purpose flour) and fried. Good shingaras are distinguished by flaky textures, almost as if they are made with a savoury pie crust.\n\nUsually, Samosas are deep-fried to a golden brown colour in vegetable oil. They are served hot and consumed with ketchup or chutney, such as mint, coriander, or tamarind, or are served in ''chaat'', along with the traditional accompaniments of yogurt, chutney, chopped onions, coriander, and ''chaat masala''. Usually, shingaras are eaten at tea time as a snack. They can also be prepared in a sweet form, rather than as a savoury one. Bengali shingaras tend to be triangular, filled with potato, peas, onions, diced almonds, or other vegetables, and are more heavily fried and crunchier than either shingara or their Indian samosa cousins. ''Fulkopir shingara'' (shingara filled with cauliflower mixture) is another very popular variation. In Bengal, there are non-vegetarian varieties of shingara called ''mangsher shingara'' (mutton shingara) and ''macher shingara'' (fish shingara). There are also sweeter versions, such as ''narkel er shingara'' (coconut shingara), as well as others filled with ''[[khoya]]'' and dipped in sugar syrup.\n\n[[File:Vegetable Samosa.jpg|thumb|Vegetable samosa]]\nIn [[Hyderabad, India]], a smaller version of the samosa with a thicker pastry crust and mince-meat filling, referred to as ''[[lukhmi]]'', is consumed, as is another variation with an onion filling.\n\nIn the states of [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Karnataka]], [[Kerala]], and [[Tamil Nadu]], samosas are slightly different, in that they are folded in a different way, much more like Portuguese ''chamu\u00e7as'', with a different style pastry. The filling also differs, typically featuring mashed potatoes with spices, fried onions, peas, carrots, cabbage, curry leaves, green chillies, etc. It is mostly eaten without chutney. Samosas in [[South India]] are made in different sizes, and fillings are greatly influenced by the local food habits. It can include many variety of fillings, such as meats and vegetables.\n\n====Bangladesh====\n[[File:Samosas, snack food at Wikipedia's 16th Birthday celebration in Chittagong (01).jpg|thumb|Bangladeshi samosas, snack food]]\n\nBoth flat-shaped (triangular) and full-shaped (tetrahedron/triangular pyramid) samosas are popular snacks in [[Bangladesh]]. A [[Bengali language|Bengali]] version of the full-shaped samosa is called a \u09b8\u09bf\u0999\u09be\u09a1\u09bc\u09be (''shingara'') and is normally smaller than the standard variety. The ''shingara'' is usually filled with pieced potatoes, vegetables, nuts etc. However, shingaras filled with beef liver are very popular in some parts of the country. The flat-shaped samosa is called a ''somosa'' or ''somucha'', and is usually filled with onions and minced meat.\n\n====Nepal====\nSamosas are called ''singadas'' in the eastern zone of [[Nepal]]; the rest of the country calls it samosa. As in India, it is a very popular snack in [[Nepalese cuisine]]. Vendors sell the dish in various markets and restaurants.\n\n====Pakistan====\nSamosas of various types are available all over [[Pakistan]]. In general, most samosa varieties sold in the southern [[Sindh]] province and in the eastern [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], especially the city of [[Lahore]], are spicier and mostly contain vegetable or potato-based fillings. However, the samosas sold in the west and north of the country mostly contain minced meat-based fillings and are comparatively less spicy. The meat samosa contains minced meat ([[Lamb and mutton|lamb]], [[beef]], or [[Chicken (food)|chicken]]) and are very popular as snack food in Pakistan.\n\nIn Pakistan, samosas of [[Karachi]] are famous for their spicy flavour, whereas samosas from [[Faisalabad]] are noted for being unusually large. Another distinct variety of samosa, available in Karachi, is called ''kaghazi samosa'' ({{lang-ur|{{nq|\u06a9\u0627\u063a\u0630\u06cc \u0633\u0645\u0648\u0633\u06c1}}}}; \"paper samosa\" in English) due to its thin and crispy covering, which resembles a [[wonton]] or [[spring roll]] wrapper. Another variant, popular in Punjab, consists of samosas with side dishes of mashed spiced chickpeas, onions, and coriander leaf salad, as well as various chutneys to top the samosas. The samosas are a fried or baked pastry with a savoury filling, such as spiced [[potato]]es, [[onion]]s, [[pea]]s, [[lentil]]s, and minced meat ([[Lamb and mutton|lamb]], [[beef]] or [[Chicken (food)|chicken]]). \nSweet samosas are also sold in the cities of Pakistan including Peshawar; these sweet samosas contain no filling and are dipped in thick sugar syrup.\n\nAnother Pakistani snack food, which is popular in Punjab, is known as \"samosa chaat\". This is a combination of a crumbled samosa, along with spiced chickpeas ([[Chaat|channa chaat]]), yogurt, and chutneys. Alternatively, the samosa can be eaten on its own with a side of chutney. \n\nIn Pakistan, samosa's are a staple iftaar food for many Pakistani families, during the month of [[Ramadan|Ramzan]].\n\n==== Maldives ====\nThe types and varieties of samosa made in [[Maldivian cuisine]] are known as ''bajiyaa''. They are filled with a mixture including [[fish]] or [[tuna]] and onions.<ref>[[Xavier Romero-Frias]], ''[https://www.himalmag.com/eating-on-the-islands/ Eating on the Islands]'', [[Himal Southasian]], Vol. 26 no. 2, pages 69-91 {{ISSN|1012-9804}}</ref>\n\n===Southeast Asia===\n\n====Burma====\n[[File:Burmese style samusa.jpg|thumb|right|[[Burmese cuisine|Burmese]]-style ''samusa'' are flat and triangular, and usually smaller than their Indian counterparts.]]\n\nSamosas are called ''samusas'' in [[Burmese language|Burmese]], and are an extremely popular snack in [[Burma]].\n\n====Indonesia====\nThe types of samosas in Indonesia are called ''samosa''\u2014usually, samosas are served as snack with sambal.

The entire pastry is then deep-fried in vegetable oil or rarely [[ghee]] to a golden brown color. It is served hot and is often eaten with fresh green chutney, such as mint, [[coriander]], or [[tamarind]]. It can also be prepared as a sweet form, rather than as a savoury one. Samosas are often served in ''[[chaat]]'', along with the traditional accompaniments of either chick pea or white pea preparation, garnished with yogurt, tamarind and green chutney, chopped onions, coriander, and ''[[chaat masala]]''\n\nIn [[Delhi]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Bihar]], and [[Uttarakhand]], a bigger version of the samosa with a spicy filling of masala potatoes, peas, crushed green chillies, cheese, and even dried fruits, as well as other variations, is quite popular. This samosa is bigger compared to other Indian and foreign variants.\n\nIn [[Odisha]], [[West Bengal]], and [[Jharkhand]], ''shingadas'' (the East Indian version of samosas) are popular snacks. They are found almost everywhere. They are a bit smaller compared to those in other parts of India, and the filling mainly consists of boiled and diced potato, along with of other ingredients. They are wrapped in a thin sheet of dough (made of all purpose flour) and fried. Good shingaras are distinguished by flaky textures, almost as if they are made with a savoury pie crust.\n\nUsually, Samosas are deep-fried to a golden brown colour in vegetable oil. They are served hot and consumed with ketchup or chutney, such as mint, coriander, or tamarind, or are served in ''chaat'', along with the traditional accompaniments of yogurt, chutney, chopped onions, coriander, and ''chaat masala''. Usually, shingaras are eaten at tea time as a snack. They can also be prepared in a sweet form, rather than as a savoury one. Bengali shingaras tend to be triangular, filled with potato, peas, onions, diced almonds, or other vegetables, and are more heavily fried and crunchier than either shingara or their Indian samosa cousins. ''Fulkopir shingara'' (shingara filled with cauliflower mixture) is another very popular variation. In Bengal, there are non-vegetarian varieties of shingara called ''mangsher shingara'' (mutton shingara) and ''macher shingara'' (fish shingara). There are also sweeter versions, such as ''narkel er shingara'' (coconut shingara), as well as others filled with ''[[khoya]]'' and dipped in sugar syrup.\n\n[[File:Vegetable Samosa.jpg|thumb|Vegetable samosa]]\nIn [[Hyderabad, India]], a smaller version of the samosa with a thicker pastry crust and mince-meat filling, referred to as ''[[lukhmi]]'', is consumed, as is another variation with an onion filling.\n\nIn the states of [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Karnataka]], [[Kerala]], and [[Tamil Nadu]], samosas are slightly different, in that they are folded in a different way, much more like Portuguese ''chamu\u00e7as'', with a different style pastry. The filling also differs, typically featuring mashed potatoes with spices, fried onions, peas, carrots, cabbage, curry leaves, green chillies, etc. It is mostly eaten without chutney. Samosas in [[South India]] are made in different sizes, and fillings are greatly influenced by the local food habits. It can include many variety of fillings, such as meats and vegetables.\n\n====Bangladesh====\n[[File:Samosas, snack food at Wikipedia's 16th Birthday celebration in Chittagong (01).jpg|thumb|Bangladeshi samosas, snack food]]\n\nBoth flat-shaped (triangular) and full-shaped (tetrahedron/triangular pyramid) samosas are popular snacks in [[Bangladesh]]. A [[Bengali language|Bengali]] version of the full-shaped samosa is called a \u09b8\u09bf\u0999\u09be\u09a1\u09bc\u09be (''shingara'') and is normally smaller than the standard variety. The ''shingara'' is usually filled with pieced potatoes, vegetables, nuts etc. However, shingaras filled with beef liver are very popular in some parts of the country. The flat-shaped samosa is called a ''somosa'' or ''somucha'', and is usually filled with onions and minced meat.\n\n====Nepal====\nSamosas are called ''singadas'' in the eastern zone of [[Nepal]]; the rest of the country calls it samosa. As in India, it is a very popular snack in [[Nepalese cuisine]]. Vendors sell the dish in various markets and restaurants.\n\n====Pakistan====\nSamosas of various types are available all over [[Pakistan]]. In general, most samosa varieties sold in the southern [[Sindh]] province and in the eastern [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], especially the city of [[Lahore]], are spicier and mostly contain vegetable or potato-based fillings. However, the samosas sold in the west and north of the country mostly contain minced meat-based fillings and are comparatively less spicy. The meat samosa contains minced meat ([[Lamb and mutton|lamb]], [[beef]], or [[Chicken (food)|chicken]]) and are very popular as snack food in Pakistan.\n\nIn Pakistan, samosas of [[Karachi]] are famous for their spicy flavour, whereas samosas from [[Faisalabad]] are noted for being unusually large. Another distinct variety of samosa, available in Karachi, is called ''kaghazi samosa'' ({{lang-ur|{{nq|\u06a9\u0627\u063a\u0630\u06cc \u0633\u0645\u0648\u0633\u06c1}}}}; \"paper samosa\" in English) due to its thin and crispy covering, which resembles a [[wonton]] or [[spring roll]] wrapper. Another variant, popular in Punjab, consists of samosas with side dishes of mashed spiced chickpeas, onions, and coriander leaf salad, as well as various chutneys to top the samosas. The samosas are a fried or baked pastry with a savoury filling, such as spiced [[potato]]es, [[onion]]s, [[pea]]s, [[lentil]]s, and minced meat ([[Lamb and mutton|lamb]], [[beef]] or [[Chicken (food)|chicken]]). \nSweet samosas are also sold in the cities of Pakistan including Peshawar; these sweet samosas contain no filling and are dipped in thick sugar syrup.\n\nAnother Pakistani snack food, which is popular in Punjab, is known as \"samosa chaat\". This is a combination of a crumbled samosa, along with spiced chickpeas ([[Chaat|channa chaat]]), yogurt, and chutneys. Alternatively, the samosa can be eaten on its own with a side of chutney. \n\nIn Pakistan, samosa's are a staple iftaar food for many Pakistani families, during the month of [[Ramadan|Ramzan]].\n\n==== Maldives ====\nThe types and varieties of samosa made in [[Maldivian cuisine]] are known as ''bajiyaa''. They are filled with a mixture including [[fish]] or [[tuna]] and onions.<ref>[[Xavier Romero-Frias]], ''[https://www.himalmag.com/eating-on-the-islands/ Eating on the Islands]'', [[Himal Southasian]], Vol. 26 no. 2, pages 69-91 {{ISSN|1012-9804}}</ref>\n\n===Southeast Asia===\n\n====Burma====\n[[File:Burmese style samusa.jpg|thumb|right|[[Burmese cuisine|Burmese]]-style ''samusa'' are flat and triangular, and usually smaller than their Indian counterparts.]]\n\nSamosas are called ''samusas'' in [[Burmese language|Burmese]], and are an extremely popular snack in [[Burma]].\n\n====Indonesia====\nThe types of samosas in Indonesia are called ''samosa''\u2014usually, samosas are served as snack with sambal.

One euro would provide a credit of 130 won. This card can be used for instance at the famous [[Pyongyang Department Store No. 1]] or at the different stores at the international hotels, where the goods are priced at the tied won rate. This tied won does not exist in the form of bank notes. In normal stores and markets goods are priced in what has been called the 'untied' won or free market rate and regular banknotes can be used here. At for instance the [[Tongil Market]] and the Kwangbok Department Store (a.k.a. the Chinese Market) there are semi-official exchange agents who will give in regular banknotes around 10,000 won for one euro (2012) to locals and foreign visitors alike, so almost 77 times as much as the tied rate.

These coins were often restruck with the original dates in later years; however, 1970 and 1974 dates also appear on the 1 and 5 chon. In 1978, 50 chon coins featuring the [[Chollima Statue]] and a rising sun were introduced into circulation during the 1979 currency reform to allow greater flexibility for vendors by eliminating the 50 chon banknote and large amounts of \"small change\" coinage carried. In 1987, 1 won coins featuring the [[Grand People's Study House]] were introduced, but did not fully replace the 1 won note which remained legal tender.\n\nWhen the historic 2.16 peg to the dollar was abandoned in 2001 to allow for greater [[convertibility]] the coins began to lose value. After 2003, these coins were rarely seen in circulation but were still redeemable. Later, a new set of coins was introduced in 2005 in denominations of 5, 10, 50, and 100 won. These coins were less impressive compared to the older series, being very plain and generic in design.

Issued in 1983, these coins were part of the \"Pakkundon\" convertible series. Coins with no \"stars\" were for general circulation in North Korea, coins marked with one star were for \"socialist visitors\", and coins marked with two stars were designated for \"capitalist visitors\". A fourth set, intended for collectors rather than circulation, was struck with the word \"specimen\" or \"example\" in Korean characters in the areas where the stars would be. The specimen/example set is the least common of the four. Besides the general circulating coins, there is an abundance of different commemorative coins minted in the name of the DPRK. Most, if not all of them, are sold to foreign [[numismatist]]s. Some of these are official, state approved coins, others are not.\n\n=== Third Won ===\nCoins were issued in 10, 50 chon and 1 won denominations in 2002 and 1 and 5 chon denominations in 2008. All denominations are struck in aluminum. These coins feature the national coat of arms on the obverse and flowers, particularly the [[Kimjongilia]] and the [[Kimilsungia]], on the reverse of the 10 and 50 chon. A magnolia adorns the 1 won.<ref name=\"dnk412\" />\n\nInitially struck in 2002, the coins were intended for use shortly after the dollar peg was removed from the currency. The 50 chon and 1 won were smaller than the previous designs, while the new 10 chon was the same size as the old. Hyperinflation became a very sudden reality, however, and the new coins were never released as planned. In 2008, 1 and 5 chon coins were also struck when a plan for monetary revaluation began. The coins were finally released into circulation in December 2009 but due to the flawed nature of the revaluation these coins again carry very little value, with especially the 1 and 5 chon being virtually irrelevant.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%\"\n|+Circulated coins\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Value !!colspan=\"3\"| Technical parameters !!colspan=\"2\"| Description !!rowspan=\"2\"| Date of minted year\n|-\n!

These were in denominations of 1, 5, 10, and 100 won. These were discontinued shortly after Soviet forces withdrew and recognized the newly independent state.\n\n=== First Won ===\nThis currency was issued in all banknote form, with the first banknotes of this issue in denominations of 15, 20, and 50 chon along with 1, 5, 10 and 100 won in 1947. The chon notes had stylized art designs while the won denominations were fairly uniform in design featuring a farmer and a worker standing together and holding the symbolic tools. This currency was later revalued in 1959 at a rate of one new won to 100 old won to fix the inflation that had occurred as a result of the Korean War.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nautilus.org/DPRKBriefingBook/economy/DPRKMonetaryHistory.html|title=DPRK Economy|last=Schuler|first=Kurt|year=2004|publisher=Tables of Modern Monetary Systems|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301194517/http://www.nautilus.org/DPRKBriefingBook/economy/DPRKMonetaryHistory.html|archivedate=2010-03-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Second Won ===\nIn 1959, the old won was replaced with the Second Won, with price and exchange rates fixed to the U.S. dollar. This banknote series was issued in denominations of 50 chon, and 1, 5, 10, 50, and 100 won. These notes were much larger than the previous issue and depicted images representing various industries in the North Korean economy.\n\nIn 1979, the currency was again reformed, and a new banknote series was issued in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 50, and 100 won. There is ongoing speculation as to why this move was made. All 1959 banknotes were removed from circulation. Circulating coins, however, were not affected by this change. The designs for this issue were much more symbolic and charismatic than previous ones, with Kim Il-sung featuring for the first time on the 100 won note.\n\nIn 1992, another redesign was carried out for banknotes, again in denominations of 1-, 5-, 10-, 50-, and 100-won. Older notes were once again withdrawn. These notes were smaller and crisper than the previous issue and depicted more modern themes. The 5 and 10 won banknotes were again issued in 1998, along with a 500 won banknote that same year but were stamped rather than engraved reflecting poorer production quality. In 2002, 1,000 and 5,000 won notes were introduced, followed by a 200 won note in 2005. The former two were identical in design to the 100 won though differing in colors and added security features, but the colored fields behind the text no longer extended all the way to the margins. In 2007, the 500 won had also been revised in this same manner along with being engraved for the first time to protect against counterfeiting. From 1998 onwards, all notes were dated using the [[North Korean calendar|Juche year]] (Juche year) along with the standard dating.\n\nIn 2005, the Central Bank of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued commemorative 200, 500, 1000 and 5000 won notes to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the foundation of North Korea. It consists of an overprint on its regular issue notes.\n\nIn 2007, a commemorative version of this banknote series was released, stamped \"Great Leader Comrade Kim Il Sung's 95th Birthday\" on all denominations.\n\nAs explained above, there are two varieties of foreign certificates. For the 1978 banknote series, foreign certificates, called \"Pakkundon\", meaning \"exchangeable money\" were implemented by an overstamp and serial number color. This was intended to protect the value of the national currency in North Korea's [[command economy]]. These were first released in 1983 in two forms, one for \"socialist visitors\" which had a red stamp, and one for \"capitalist visitors\" which had a green stamp. Another series was released in 1986 with either a blue or red [[Guilloch\u00e9]] style stamp. These were issued in all denominations, except for the \u20a9100 note, presumably because it was assumed by the government that foreign visitors to North Korea would not show proper respect for its depiction of Kim Il-sung. These notes were discontinued in 1988 and replaced with a new series of Pakkundon in all banknote form that was more distinguishable and unmistakable from generic circulation currency.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%\"\n|+Banknotes of the North Korean won (1978 issue)\n|-\n!

Unlike previous reforms, the 2009 move sparked a nationwide panic when it was announced there would be a two-week waiting period between the withdrawal of the old currency and the introduction of the new currency, coupled with an exchange limit of only 500,000 old won for each person, effectively wiping out savings. The state eventually pulled back on most exchange limits; however, the revaluation proved to be a failure.\n\nLike the coins for this series, some of the denominations were initially printed in 2002 but were never released into circulation, pointing to a planned monetary revaluation much earlier than 2009 that was never carried out.\n\nThe current series of banknotes of the third won are issued in denominations of 5-, 10-, 50-, 100-, 200-, 500-, 1,000-, 2,000-, and 5,000-won. [[Kim Il-sung]] is depicted only on the obverse of the highest denomination, with the 100 won note featuring the [[Magnolia]] (National Flower) and other notes depicting North Koreans of different professions and various monuments in North Korea.<ref name=\"dnk412\" /> The exchange rate was 100 second won to 1 third won.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/|title=Aktuelle Nachrichten online|first=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|last=GmbH|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nUnlike all previous series, these notes were all uniform in dimensions rather than staggered in size from smallest to largest. There are rumors that the original designs for the 1,000 and 2,000 won notes depicted Kim Il-sung and had similar design features to the 5,000 won that were scrapped and destroyed due to counterfeiters or thieves breaking into a bank warehouse and stealing early notes or printing materials, resulting in a total redesign of the two denominations in question.\n\nIn 2012, another commemorative series of banknotes was released, this time in the 2002\u20132009 series but similarly stamped \"Great Leader Comrade Kim Il Sung's 100th Birthday.\" Once again this stamp appeared on all denominations.<ref>[http://banknotenews.com/files/20a77c7620cccd7435f61161b2077912-2930.php North Korea new 100th birthday commemorative notes confirmed] BanknoteNews.com.

One euro would provide a credit of 130 won. This card can be used for instance at the famous [[Pyongyang Department Store No. 1]] or at the different stores at the international hotels, where the goods are priced at the tied won rate. This tied won does not exist in the form of bank notes. In normal stores and markets goods are priced in what has been called the 'untied' won or free market rate and regular banknotes can be used here. At for instance the [[Tongil Market]] and the Kwangbok Department Store (a.k.a. the Chinese Market) there are semi-official exchange agents who will give in regular banknotes around 10,000 won for one euro (2012) to locals and foreign visitors alike, so almost 77 times as much as the tied rate. However, the prices in the normal shops outside the tied won and restricted state shops are also based on this untied won rate.<ref>Black Market cash: the real value of N.

These coins were often restruck with the original dates in later years; however, 1970 and 1974 dates also appear on the 1 and 5 chon. In 1978, 50 chon coins featuring the [[Chollima Statue]] and a rising sun were introduced into circulation during the 1979 currency reform to allow greater flexibility for vendors by eliminating the 50 chon banknote and large amounts of \"small change\" coinage carried. In 1987, 1 won coins featuring the [[Grand People's Study House]] were introduced, but did not fully replace the 1 won note which remained legal tender.\n\nWhen the historic 2.16 peg to the dollar was abandoned in 2001 to allow for greater [[convertibility]] the coins began to lose value. After 2003, these coins were rarely seen in circulation but were still redeemable. Later, a new set of coins was introduced in 2005 in denominations of 5, 10, 50, and 100 won. These coins were less impressive compared to the older series, being very plain and generic in design.

Issued in 1983, these coins were part of the \"Pakkundon\" convertible series. Coins with no \"stars\" were for general circulation in North Korea, coins marked with one star were for \"socialist visitors\", and coins marked with two stars were designated for \"capitalist visitors\". A fourth set, intended for collectors rather than circulation, was struck with the word \"specimen\" or \"example\" in Korean characters in the areas where the stars would be. The specimen/example set is the least common of the four. Besides the general circulating coins, there is an abundance of different commemorative coins minted in the name of the DPRK. Most, if not all of them, are sold to foreign [[numismatist]]s. Some of these are official, state approved coins, others are not.\n\n=== Third Won ===\nCoins were issued in 10, 50 chon and 1 won denominations in 2002 and 1 and 5 chon denominations in 2008. All denominations are struck in aluminum. These coins feature the national coat of arms on the obverse and flowers, particularly the [[Kimjongilia]] and the [[Kimilsungia]], on the reverse of the 10 and 50 chon. A magnolia adorns the 1 won.<ref name=\"dnk412\" />\n\nInitially struck in 2002, the coins were intended for use shortly after the dollar peg was removed from the currency. The 50 chon and 1 won were smaller than the previous designs, while the new 10 chon was the same size as the old. Hyperinflation became a very sudden reality, however, and the new coins were never released as planned. In 2008, 1 and 5 chon coins were also struck when a plan for monetary revaluation began. The coins were finally released into circulation in December 2009 but due to the flawed nature of the revaluation these coins again carry very little value, with especially the 1 and 5 chon being virtually irrelevant.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%\"\n|+Circulated coins\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Value !!colspan=\"3\"| Technical parameters !!colspan=\"2\"| Description !!rowspan=\"2\"| Date of minted year\n|-\n!

These were in denominations of 1, 5, 10, and 100 won. These were discontinued shortly after Soviet forces withdrew and recognized the newly independent state.\n\n=== First Won ===\nThis currency was issued in all banknote form, with the first banknotes of this issue in denominations of 15, 20, and 50 chon along with 1, 5, 10 and 100 won in 1947. The chon notes had stylized art designs while the won denominations were fairly uniform in design featuring a farmer and a worker standing together and holding the symbolic tools. This currency was later revalued in 1959 at a rate of one new won to 100 old won to fix the inflation that had occurred as a result of the Korean War.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nautilus.org/DPRKBriefingBook/economy/DPRKMonetaryHistory.html|title=DPRK Economy|last=Schuler|first=Kurt|year=2004|publisher=Tables of Modern Monetary Systems|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301194517/http://www.nautilus.org/DPRKBriefingBook/economy/DPRKMonetaryHistory.html|archivedate=2010-03-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Second Won ===\nIn 1959, the old won was replaced with the Second Won, with price and exchange rates fixed to the U.S. dollar. This banknote series was issued in denominations of 50 chon, and 1, 5, 10, 50, and 100 won. These notes were much larger than the previous issue and depicted images representing various industries in the North Korean economy.\n\nIn 1979, the currency was again reformed, and a new banknote series was issued in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 50, and 100 won. There is ongoing speculation as to why this move was made. All 1959 banknotes were removed from circulation. Circulating coins, however, were not affected by this change. The designs for this issue were much more symbolic and charismatic than previous ones, with Kim Il-sung featuring for the first time on the 100 won note.\n\nIn 1992, another redesign was carried out for banknotes, again in denominations of 1-, 5-, 10-, 50-, and 100-won. Older notes were once again withdrawn. These notes were smaller and crisper than the previous issue and depicted more modern themes. The 5 and 10 won banknotes were again issued in 1998, along with a 500 won banknote that same year but were stamped rather than engraved reflecting poorer production quality. In 2002, 1,000 and 5,000 won notes were introduced, followed by a 200 won note in 2005. The former two were identical in design to the 100 won though differing in colors and added security features, but the colored fields behind the text no longer extended all the way to the margins. In 2007, the 500 won had also been revised in this same manner along with being engraved for the first time to protect against counterfeiting. From 1998 onwards, all notes were dated using the [[North Korean calendar|Juche year]] (Juche year) along with the standard dating.\n\nIn 2005, the Central Bank of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued commemorative 200, 500, 1000 and 5000 won notes to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the foundation of North Korea. It consists of an overprint on its regular issue notes.\n\nIn 2007, a commemorative version of this banknote series was released, stamped \"Great Leader Comrade Kim Il Sung's 95th Birthday\" on all denominations.\n\nAs explained above, there are two varieties of foreign certificates. For the 1978 banknote series, foreign certificates, called \"Pakkundon\", meaning \"exchangeable money\" were implemented by an overstamp and serial number color. This was intended to protect the value of the national currency in North Korea's [[command economy]]. These were first released in 1983 in two forms, one for \"socialist visitors\" which had a red stamp, and one for \"capitalist visitors\" which had a green stamp. Another series was released in 1986 with either a blue or red [[Guilloch\u00e9]] style stamp. These were issued in all denominations, except for the \u20a9100 note, presumably because it was assumed by the government that foreign visitors to North Korea would not show proper respect for its depiction of Kim Il-sung. These notes were discontinued in 1988 and replaced with a new series of Pakkundon in all banknote form that was more distinguishable and unmistakable from generic circulation currency.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%\"\n|+Banknotes of the North Korean won (1978 issue)\n|-\n!

Unlike previous reforms, the 2009 move sparked a nationwide panic when it was announced there would be a two-week waiting period between the withdrawal of the old currency and the introduction of the new currency, coupled with an exchange limit of only 500,000 old won for each person, effectively wiping out savings. The state eventually pulled back on most exchange limits; however, the revaluation proved to be a failure.\n\nLike the coins for this series, some of the denominations were initially printed in 2002 but were never released into circulation, pointing to a planned monetary revaluation much earlier than 2009 that was never carried out.\n\nThe current series of banknotes of the third won are issued in denominations of 5-, 10-, 50-, 100-, 200-, 500-, 1,000-, 2,000-, and 5,000-won. [[Kim Il-sung]] is depicted only on the obverse of the highest denomination, with the 100 won note featuring the [[Magnolia]] (National Flower) and other notes depicting North Koreans of different professions and various monuments in North Korea.<ref name=\"dnk412\" /> The exchange rate was 100 second won to 1 third won.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/|title=Aktuelle Nachrichten online|first=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|last=GmbH|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nUnlike all previous series, these notes were all uniform in dimensions rather than staggered in size from smallest to largest. There are rumors that the original designs for the 1,000 and 2,000 won notes depicted Kim Il-sung and had similar design features to the 5,000 won that were scrapped and destroyed due to counterfeiters or thieves breaking into a bank warehouse and stealing early notes or printing materials, resulting in a total redesign of the two denominations in question.\n\nIn 2012, another commemorative series of banknotes was released, this time in the 2002\u20132009 series but similarly stamped \"Great Leader Comrade Kim Il Sung's 100th Birthday.\" Once again this stamp appeared on all denominations.<ref>[http://banknotenews.com/files/20a77c7620cccd7435f61161b2077912-2930.php North Korea new 100th birthday commemorative notes confirmed] BanknoteNews.com.
