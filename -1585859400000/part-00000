Other matters such as, political, economic, military, social, and even commercial reasons could have played a role in the building of Ulugh Beg\u2019s observatory.<ref name=\":1\" /> Another reason of starting his own observatory could have been because of Ulugh Beg\u2019s differences in observations of those with al-S\u016bf\u012b .\n\nThe Ulugh Beg Observatory was built somewhere around 824-1422. Different sources mention different dates; however, many sources mention around 830 to be the date of the observatory\u2019s foundation and 1422-1428 to be the construction competition of the observatory<ref name=\":6\" />. Many Old Persian texts include the Samarkand Observatory and the great Ulugh Beg.\n\nHe invited skillful mathematicians and astronomers to help build this observatory and also a madrassa in Samarkand. Among those he invited were Gh\u012by\u0101th al-D\u012bn Jamshid al-Kashi, Mu\u2019in al-Din al-Kashi, Mu\u2019in al-Din al-Kashi, Salah al-Din Qadi Zada Rumi, and Ali Qushiji<ref name=\":6\" />. Over 60 mathematicians and astronomers were invited to the observatory. Jamshid Al-Kashi was appointed as the first director of the observatory. After al-Kashi\u2019s death Qada Zada became the director of the observatory. After the death of Qadi Zada, Qushji led the observatory as the last and final director. The Samarkand Observatory was a place for astronomers and mathematician to work together in finding new discoveries.\n\nUlugh Beg\u2019s observatory was built according to the plans of the Maragha observatory, which was designed by Nasir al-din al-Tusi<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Juhel|first=Alain|date=2007|title=Prince of Samarqand Stars|url=|journal=The Mathematical Tourist|volume=|pages=44\u201350|via=}}</ref>. Ulugh Beg\u2019s observatory included the largest quadrant principle device. The building was not tall but was allowed a maximal size for the arc of the circle. This device was carefully oriented, and the arc was scaled very accurately. This device was very versatile. It could accurately measure the sun from the horizon, the altitude of a star and other planets. The duration of the year, period of planets, and eclipses were measured by this device. Ulugh Beg\u2019s measurements of planets closely relate to today\u2019s measurement, showing us the phenomenal accuracy of the device<ref name=\":7\" />.\n\nPeople visiting Ulugh Beg's observatory today, can only see the foundations and the buried part of the marble quadrant<ref name=\":7\" />. Those are the only original vestiges from the observatory. Much of the decline of the observatory could be contributed to Ulugh Beg's death.\n\nNot much is known about the decline of the observatory. However, Ulugh Beg's assassination by his son, Abd al Latif, in around 1449, may have the major factor.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ulugh-beg-observatory|title=Ulugh Beg Observatory|website=Atlas Obscura|access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref> Ulugh Beg's death caused chaos within the observatory.

Having received an invitation from Ulugh Beg, Al-Kashi left his native land of Kashan in north central Iran and went to Samarkand. A letter that Al-Kashi wrote to his father during his stay in Samarkand has been translated by Kennedy (1960) and Say\u0131l\u0131 (1960). This letter, written in Persian, has shaped the modern view of Samarkand activities substantially despite its lack of information about scientific activities that were taking place at the observatory. However, a new letter written by Al-Kashi to his father has been found in Iran, and the translation of this letter by Bagheri sheds more light on the scientific atmosphere of Samarkand in particular and reduces the ambiguity of certain elements in the first letter by virtue of their overlapping parts.<ref name=\":5\">{{cite journal|last1=A Letter of Jamsh\u0131d al-Kash\u0131 to His Father: Scientific Research and Personalities at a Fifteenth Century Court, Orientalia 29 (1960), 191\u2013213; reprinted in Edward S.

The Fakhr\u0131 sextant, stood on top of a rock into which some of it was carved, so the edifice would not be tall given the soft bricks of the area. Al-Kashi compares this to Maragha, saying that the sextant is positioned higher there but also notes the flat roof present in Samarkand should facilitate scientific improvement given the fact that \u201cinstruments may be placed on it\u201d.<ref name=\":02\" /> This information, about the sextants in Maragha is contradictory to other sources that state there were no sextants at Maragha.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ayd\u0131n Say\u0131l\u0131, Ulug\u02c7 Bey ve Semerkanddeki I\u02c6lim Faal\u0131yeti Hakk\u0131nda G\u0131yasu\u00a8ddin-i Ka\u02c6s\u00b8\u0131\u2019nin Mektubu: Ghiyath al-D\u0131n al-Kash\u0131\u2019s Letter on Ulugh Bey and the Scientific Activity in Samarqand, Ankara: Tu\u00a8rk Tarih Kurumu Bas\u0131mevi, 1960.)

The lack of awareness and strict adherence to prior methods by Ulugh Beg himself reveals the perhaps provincial nature of their studies. However, this perceived closed-mindedness was alleviated by the increasing diversity of scientists and students that were invited to the observatory.

Ulugh Beg was very skilled in mathematics and astronomy. He taught many important astronomers; one example is the famous Ali Qushji.\n\nMany historians have tried to accurately identify dates of the events that have occurred during the Samarkand or Ulugh Beg Observatory<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Yazdi|first=Hamid-Reza Giahi|date=2015|title=Chronology of the Events of the Samarquand \"Observatory and School\" Based on some Old Persian Texts: a Revision|url=|journal=Suhayl|volume=|pages=145\u2013165|via=}}</ref>.

Other matters such as, political, economic, military, social, and even commercial reasons could have played a role in the building of Ulugh Beg\u2019s observatory.<ref name=\":1\" /> Another reason of starting his own observatory could have been because of Ulugh Beg\u2019s differences in observations of those with al-S\u016bf\u012b .\n\nThe Ulugh Beg Observatory was built somewhere around 824-1422. Different sources mention different dates; however, many sources mention around 830 to be the date of the observatory\u2019s foundation and 1422-1428 to be the construction competition of the observatory<ref name=\":6\" />. Many Old Persian texts include the Samarkand Observatory and the great Ulugh Beg.\n\nHe invited skillful mathematicians and astronomers to help build this observatory and also a madrassa in Samarkand. Among those he invited were Gh\u012by\u0101th al-D\u012bn Jamshid al-Kashi, Mu\u2019in al-Din al-Kashi, Mu\u2019in al-Din al-Kashi, Salah al-Din Qadi Zada Rumi, and Ali Qushiji<ref name=\":6\" />. Over 60 mathematicians and astronomers were invited to the observatory. Jamshid Al-Kashi was appointed as the first director of the observatory. After al-Kashi\u2019s death Qada Zada became the director of the observatory. After the death of Qadi Zada, Qushji led the observatory as the last and final director. The Samarkand Observatory was a place for astronomers and mathematician to work together in finding new discoveries.\n\nUlugh Beg\u2019s observatory was built according to the plans of the Maragha observatory, which was designed by Nasir al-din al-Tusi<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Juhel|first=Alain|date=2007|title=Prince of Samarqand Stars|url=|journal=The Mathematical Tourist|volume=|pages=44\u201350|via=}}</ref>. Ulugh Beg\u2019s observatory included the largest quadrant principle device. The building was not tall but was allowed a maximal size for the arc of the circle. This device was carefully oriented, and the arc was scaled very accurately. This device was very versatile. It could accurately measure the sun from the horizon, the altitude of a star and other planets. The duration of the year, period of planets, and eclipses were measured by this device. Ulugh Beg\u2019s measurements of planets closely relate to today\u2019s measurement, showing us the phenomenal accuracy of the device<ref name=\":7\" />.\n\nPeople visiting Ulugh Beg's observatory today, can only see the foundations and the buried part of the marble quadrant<ref name=\":7\" />. Those are the only original vestiges from the observatory. Much of the decline of the observatory could be contributed to Ulugh Beg's death.\n\nNot much is known about the decline of the observatory. However, Ulugh Beg's assassination by his son, Abd al Latif, in around 1449, may have the major factor.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ulugh-beg-observatory|title=Ulugh Beg Observatory|website=Atlas Obscura|access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref> Ulugh Beg's death caused chaos within the observatory. The observatory was destroyed and dozens of talented astronomers and mathematicians were driven away.<ref name=\":3\" /> In 1908, the Russian archaeologist Vassily Vyatkin uncovered the remains of the observatory.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n'''<big>Scientific Atmosphere</big>'''\n\nJamshid [[Al-Kashi]], a 15th century astronomer and mathematician, is known to have relocated to Samarkand to interact with the scientific processes taking place there. Having received an invitation from Ulugh Beg, Al-Kashi left his native land of Kashan in north central Iran and went to Samarkand. A letter that Al-Kashi wrote to his father during his stay in Samarkand has been translated by Kennedy (1960) and Say\u0131l\u0131 (1960). This letter, written in Persian, has shaped the modern view of Samarkand activities substantially despite its lack of information about scientific activities that were taking place at the observatory. However, a new letter written by Al-Kashi to his father has been found in Iran, and the translation of this letter, by Bagheri, sheds more light on the scientific atmosphere of Samarkand in particular and reduces the ambiguity of certain elements in the first letter by virtue of their overlapping parts.<ref name=\":5\">{{cite journal|last1=A Letter of Jamsh\u0131d al-Kash\u0131 to His Father: Scientific Research and Personalities at a Fifteenth Century Court, Orientalia 29 (1960), 191\u2013213; reprinted in Edward S.

The lack of awareness and strict adherence to prior methods by Ulugh Beg himself reveals the perhaps provincial nature of their studies. However, this perceived closed-mindedness was alleviated by the increasing diversity of scientists and students that were invited to the observatory.

One of the most significant parts of the Zij-I Sultani is Ulugh Beg\u2019s sine table. The table is 18 pages long and has values of sine to nine decimal places for every degree from zero to 87, it also contains the value of sine to 11 decimal places from 87 to 90 degrees. The Zij was influential and was continuously used until the 19th century and hundreds of copies of the original Persian manuscript exist around the world. It has also been translated into many languages including Arabic, Turkish, and Hebrew. Commentaries by known astronomers like Quishji have also been made.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nUlugh Beg determined the length of the [[tropical year]] as 365<sup>d</sup> 5<sup>h</sup> 49<sup>m</sup> 15<sup>s</sup>, which has an error of +25<sup>s</sup>, making it more accurate than [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]' estimate which had an error of +30<sup>s</sup>. Ulugh Beg also determined the Earth's [[axial tilt]] as 23;30,17 degrees in [[sexagesimal]] notation, which in decimal notation converts to 23.5047 degrees.<ref>L.P.E.A.
