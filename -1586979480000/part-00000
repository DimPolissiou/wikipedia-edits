For Presbyterian scholars in the nineteenth century, these communities of clergy who differed in organisation and ethos from later monastic orders were further evidence of the similarity between early Christianity in Ireland and Scotland and later Presbyterianism. This interpretation of the character of the Celtic Church was an important aspect of Presbyterian identity in global terms. At the first meeting in 1877 of the Alliance of the Reformed Churches holding the Presbyterian System (later the World Alliance of Reformed Churches), Peter Lorimer (1812-79), a Presbyterian professor in London, noted 'that the early Church of St. Patrick, Columba, and Columbanus, was far more nearly allied in its fundamental principles of order and discipline to the Presbyterian than to the Episcopalian Churches of modern times'.}}</ref><ref name=\"TaylorAnderson1852\">{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=James |last2=Anderson|first2=John |title=The Pictorial History of Scotland|year=1852|language=English|page=51|quote=The zealous Presbyterian maintains, that the church established by Columba was formed on a Presbyterian model, and that it recognized the great principle of clerical equality.}}</ref><ref name=\"Bradley2013\">{{cite book|last=Bradley|first=Ian|title=Columba|date=24 July 2013|publisher=Wild Goose Publications|language=English|isbn=9781849522724|page=29|quote=Columba has found favour with enthusiasts for all things Celtic and with those who have seen him as establishing a proto-Presbyterian church clearly distinguishable from the episcopally goverened church favoured by Rome-educated Bishop Ninian.}}</ref> Tracing their apostolic origin to [[John the Apostle|Saint John]],<ref name=\"DickensLewis1920\">{{cite journal|last=Dickens-Lewis|first=W.F.|year=1920|title=Apostolicity of Presbyterianism: Ancient Culdeeism and Modern Presbyterianism|journal=The Presbyterian Magazine|publisher=[[Presbyterian Church (USA)]]|volume=26|issue=1\u20137|page=529|quote=The Culdees who claimed at the Synod of Whitby apostolic descent from St. John, as against the Romish claim of the authority of St. Peter, retired into Scotland.}}</ref><ref name=\"Thomson1896\">{{cite book|last=Thomson|first=Thomas|title=A History of the Scottish People from the Earliest Times|url=https://archive.org/details/ahistoryscottis00annagoog|year=1896|publisher=Blackie|language=English|page=[https://archive.org/details/ahistoryscottis00annagoog/page/n181 141]|quote=...for the primitive apostolic church which St. John had established in the East and Columba transported to our shores.

Education was an important element, as was passion for spreading the word, that is, evangelism. The Celtic brothers led a simple life in simply constructed buildings. The churches and monastic buildings were usually made of wood and wattle and had thatched roofs. After the death of St. Columba in AD 597, the autonomy of the Celtic Church did not last long.

It reformed its doctrines and government, drawing on the principles of [[John Calvin]] which Knox had been exposed to while living in [[Geneva]], Switzerland. In 1560, an assembly of some nobles, lairds and burgesses, as well as several churchmen, claiming in defiance of the Queen to be a Scottish Parliament, abolished papal jurisdiction and approved the ''[[Scots Confession]]'', but did not accept many of the principles laid out in Knox's ''[[First Book of Discipline]]'', which argued, among other things, that all of the assets of the old church should pass to the new. The 1560 [[Scottish Reformation#Reformation Settlement of 1560|Reformation Settlement]] was not ratified by the crown, as [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary I]], a Catholic, refused to do so, and the question of [[Ecclesiastical polity|church government]] also remained unresolved. {{citation needed|date=February 2020}} In 1572 the acts of 1560 were finally approved by the young [[James VI]], but the [[Concordat of Leith]] also allowed the crown to appoint bishops with the church's approval. John Knox himself had no clear views on the office of bishop, preferring to see them renamed as 'superintendents' which is a translation of the Greek; but in response to the new Concordat a Presbyterian party emerged headed by [[Andrew Melville]], the author of the ''[[Second Book of Discipline]]''. {{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nMelville and his supporters enjoyed some temporary successes\u2014most notably in the Golden Act of 1592, which gave parliamentary approval to Presbyterian courts. James VI, who succeeded to the English throne in 1603, believed that Presbyterianism was incompatible with monarchy, declaring \"No bishop, no king\"<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Established Church of Scotland}}</ref> and by skillful manipulation of both church and state, steadily reintroduced parliamentary and then diocesan [[episcopal polity|episcopacy]]. By the time he died in 1625, the Church of Scotland had a full panel of bishops and archbishops. General Assemblies met only at times and places approved by the Crown. {{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n[[File:Reformed Scots Church Denominations.svg|thumb|right|upright=2.25| Timeline of the evolution of the churches of Scotland from the Reformation]]\n[[Charles I of England|Charles I]] inherited a settlement in Scotland based on a balanced compromise between Calvinist doctrine and episcopal practice. Lacking the political judgement of his father, he began to upset this by moving into more dangerous areas. Disapproving of the 'plainness' of the Scottish service he, together with his [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[William Laud]], sought to introduce the kind of liturgical practice in use in England. The centrepiece of this new strategy was the Prayer Book of 1637, a slightly modified version of the Anglican ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]''. Although this was devised by a panel of Scottish bishops, Charles' insistence that it be drawn up in secret and adopted sight-unseen led to widespread discontent. When the Prayer Book was finally introduced at [[St Giles Cathedral]] in Edinburgh in mid-1637 it caused an outbreak of rioting, which, starting with [[Jenny Geddes]], spread across Scotland. In early 1638 the [[National Covenant]] was signed by large numbers of Scots, protesting at the introduction of the Prayer Book and other liturgical innovations that had not first been tested and approved by free Parliaments and General Assemblies of the Church. In November 1638, the General Assembly in Glasgow, the first to meet for twenty years, not only declared the Prayer Book unlawful, but went on to abolish the office of bishop itself. The Church of Scotland was then established on a Presbyterian basis. Charles' attempt at resistance to these developments led to the outbreak of the [[Bishops' Wars]]. In the ensuing civil wars, the Scots [[Covenanters]] at one point made common cause with the English parliamentarians\u2014resulting in the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] being agreed by both. This document remains the [[subordinate standard]] of the Church of Scotland, but was replaced in England after the [[English Restoration|Restoration]]. {{citation needed|date=February 2020}}O\n\nEpiscopacy was reintroduced to Scotland after the Restoration, the cause of considerable discontent, especially in the south-west of the country, where the Presbyterian tradition was strongest. The modern situation largely dates from 1690, when after the [[Glorious Revolution]] the majority of Scottish bishops were [[Nonjuring schism|non-jurors]], that is, they believed they could not swear allegiance to [[William III of England|William II]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] while [[James VII]] lived. To reduce their influence the Scots Parliament guaranteed Presbyterian governance of the Church by law, excluding what became the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]]. Most of the remaining Covenanters, disagreeing with the Restoration Settlement on various political and theological grounds, most notably because the Settlement did not acknowledge the National Covenant and Solemn League and Covenant, also did not join the Church of Scotland, instead forming the [[Reformed Presbyterian Church of Scotland]] in 1690. {{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nControversy still surrounded the relationship between the Church of Scotland's independence and the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] of Scotland. The interference of civil courts with Church decisions, particularly over the appointment of ministers, following the [[Church Patronage (Scotland) Act 1711]], which gave landowners, or patrons, the right to appoint ministers to vacant pulpits, would lead to several splits. This began with the [[First Secession|secession of 1733]] and culminated in the [[Disruption of 1843]], when a large portion of the Church broke away to form the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Church of Scotland]]. The seceding groups tended to divide and reunite among themselves\u2014leading to a proliferation of Presbyterian denominations in Scotland.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n[[File:Old logo of the CoS.png|thumb|right|upright|Older rectangular logo of the Church of Scotland.]]\nThe [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] passed the [[Church of Scotland Act 1921]], finally recognising the full independence of the Church in matters spiritual, and as a result of this, and passage of the Church of Scotland (Property and Endowments) Act 1925, the Kirk was able to unite with the [[United Free Church of Scotland]] in 1929. The United Free Church of Scotland was itself the product of the union of the former [[United Presbyterian Church of Scotland]] and the majority of the Free Church of Scotland in 1900.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nSome independent Scottish Presbyterian denominations still remain. These include the [[Free Church of Scotland (post 1900)|Free Church of Scotland]]\u2014sometimes given the epithet [[Wee Free|The Wee Frees]]\u2014(originally formed of those congregations which refused to unite with the [[United Presbyterian Church of Scotland|United Presbyterian Church]] in 1900), the [[United Free Church of Scotland]] (formed of congregations which refused to unite with the Church of Scotland in 1929), the [[Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland]] (which broke from the Free Church of Scotland in 1893), the [[Associated Presbyterian Churches]] (which emerged as a result of a split in the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland in the 1980s) and the [[Free Church of Scotland (Continuing)]] (which emerged from a split in the Free Church of Scotland in 2000).{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n[[File:NecTamenConsumebatur.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Stained glass showing the burning bush and the motto \"nec tamen consumebatur\", [[St. Mungo's Cathedral, Glasgow]].]]\n\nThe motto of the Church of Scotland is ''nec tamen consumebatur'' ([[Latin (language)|Latin]])\u2014\"Yet it was not consumed\", an allusion to Exodus 3:2 and the [[Burning Bush]].\n\n==Theology and practice==\nThe basis of faith for the Church of Scotland is the ''Word of God'', which it views as being \"contained in the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament\". Its principal subordinate standard is ''[[Westminster Confession of Faith|The Westminster Confession of Faith]]'' (1647), although here liberty of opinion is granted on those matters \"which do not enter into the substance of the faith\" (Art. 2 and 5). (The 19th century Scottish distinction was between '[[evangelicals]]' and '[[Moderate Party (Scotland)|moderates]]'.) There is no official document in which substantial matters and insubstantial ones are clearly demarcated.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe Church of Scotland has no compulsory [[prayer book]], although it does have a [[Hymnbooks of the Church of Scotland|hymn book]] (the 4th edition was published in 2005). Its ''[[Book of Common Order]]'' contains recommendations for public worship, which are usually followed fairly closely in the case of sacraments and ordinances. Preaching is the central focus of most services. Traditionally, Scots worship centred on the singing of [[Metrical psalter|metrical psalm]]s and paraphrases, but for generations these have been supplemented with [[Christian music]] of all types.<ref name=\"Bowden2005\"/> The typical Church of Scotland service lasts about an hour. There is normally no sung or responsive liturgy, but worship is the responsibility of the minister in each parish, and the style of worship can vary and be quite experimental. In recent years, a variety of modern song books have been widely used to appeal more to contemporary trends in music, and elements from alternative liturgies including those of the [[Iona Community]] are incorporated in some congregations. Although traditionally worship is conducted by the parish minister, participation and leadership by members who are not ministers in services is becoming more frequent, especially in the Highlands and the Borders.\n\nIn common with other [[Reformed]] denominations, the Church recognises two [[sacraments]]: [[Baptism]] and Holy Communion (the [[Eucharist|Lord's Supper]]). The Church baptises both believing adults and the children of Christian families. Communion in the Church of Scotland today is open to Christians of whatever denomination, without precondition. Communion services are usually taken fairly seriously in the Church; traditionally, a congregation held only three or four per year, although practice now greatly varies between congregations. In some congregations, communion is celebrated once a month.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nTheologically, the Church of Scotland is Reformed (ultimately in the [[Calvinist]] tradition) and is a member of the [[World Alliance of Reformed Churches]].<ref name=\"WCRC2018\"/>\n\n===Ecumenical relations===\nThe Church of Scotland is a member of ACTS ([[Action of Churches Together in Scotland]]) and, through its Committee on Ecumenical Relations, works closely with other denominations in Scotland. The present inter-denominational co-operation marks a distinct change from attitudes in certain quarters of the Church in the early twentieth century and before, when opposition to Irish Roman Catholic immigration was vocal (see [[Roman Catholicism in Scotland|Catholicism in Scotland]]). The Church of Scotland is a member of the [[World Council of Churches]], the [[Conference of European Churches]], the [[Community of Protestant Churches in Europe]], and the [[World Communion of Reformed Churches]]. The Church of Scotland is a member of [[Churches Together in Britain and Ireland]] and, through its Presbytery of England, is a member of [[Churches Together in England]]. The Church of Scotland continues to foster relationships with other Presbyterian denominations in Scotland even where agreement is difficult.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} In May 2016 the Church of Scotland ratified the Columba Agreement (approved by the Church of England's General Synod in February 2016), calling for the two churches to work more closely together on matters of common interest.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n===\"God's Invitation\"===\nWhile the Bible is the basis of faith of the Church of Scotland, and the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] is the subordinate standard,<ref>''Ordinal and Service Book'', Open University Press 1931</ref><ref>[http://www.churchofscotland.org.uk/about_us/our_faith/westminster_confession_of_faith Westminster Confession of Faith] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022093419/http://www.churchofscotland.org.uk/about_us/our_faith/westminster_confession_of_faith |date=22 October 2016 }} page at Church of Scotland website</ref> a request was presented to a General Assembly of the Church of Scotland for a statement explaining the historic Christian faith in [[jargon]]-free non-theological language. \"God's Invitation\" was prepared to fulfil that request.

At the same time the number of candidates accepted for full-time ministry has reduced from 24 (2005) to 8 (2009).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.churchofscotland.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/3457/ga10_reports_ministries.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=21 February 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304115119/http://www.churchofscotland.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/3457/ga10_reports_ministries.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016 }}</ref> Since 2014, the number of full-time candidates accepted into training each year has been in the range of 13 to 16.

This means the Kirk in practice maintains a presence in every community in Scotland. The Kirk also pools its resources to ensure continuation of this presence.\n\nThe Kirk played a leading role in providing [[Universal education|universal]] [[education in Scotland]] (the first such provision in the modern world), largely due to its teaching that all should be able to read the Bible. Today it does not operate schools, as these were transferred to the state in the latter half of the 19th century.\n\n==Governance and administration==\n{{see also|List of Church of Scotland parishes|List of Church of Scotland synods and presbyteries|Presbyterian church governance}}\n\nThe Church of Scotland is [[Presbyterian]] in polity and [[Reformed]] in theology. The most recent articulation of its legal position, the ''[[Articles Declaratory of the Constitution of the Church of Scotland|Articles Declaratory]]'' (1921), spells out the key concepts.\n\n===Courts and assemblies===\nAs a Presbyterian church, the Kirk has no bishops but is rather governed by elders and ministers (collectively called presbyters) sitting in a series of courts. Each congregation is led by a [[Kirk Session]]. The Kirk Sessions in turn are answerable to regional [[Presbyterian polity#Presbytery|presbyteries]] (of which the Kirk currently has [[List of Church of Scotland synods and presbyteries|over 40]]). The supreme body is the annual [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland|General Assembly]], which meets each May in [[Edinburgh]].\n\n===Moderator===\nEach court is convened by the '[[Moderators and clerks in the Church of Scotland|moderator]]'\u2014at the local level of the Kirk Session normally the parish minister who is ''ex officio'' member and Moderator of the Session. Congregations where there is no minister, or where the minister is incapacitated may be moderated by a specially trained elder. Presbyteries and the General Assembly elect a moderator each year. The [[Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland|Moderator of the General Assembly]] serves for the year as the public representative of the Church\u2014but beyond that enjoys no special powers or privileges and is in no sense the leader or official spokesperson of the Kirk. At all levels, moderators may be either elders or ministers. Only Moderators of Kirk Sessions are obliged to be trained for the role.\n\n===Councils===\n[[File:CofSBurningBushLogo.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Burning Bush]] emblem of the Church of Scotland, above the entrance to the [[Church of Scotland Offices|Church Offices]] in Edinburgh]]\nAt a national level, the work of the Church of Scotland is chiefly carried out by \"Councils\", each supported by full-time staff mostly based at the [[Church of Scotland Offices]] in Edinburgh. The Councils are:\n*Council of Assembly\n*[[Church and Society Council]]\n*Ministries Council\n*Mission and Discipleship Council\n*Social Care Council ''(based at Charis House, Edinburgh)''\n*World Mission Council\n\nThe Church of Scotland's Social Care Council (known as [http://www.crossreach.org.uk CrossReach]) is the largest provider of [[Social work|social care]] in Scotland today, running projects for various disadvantaged and vulnerable groups: including care for the elderly; help with alcoholism, drug, and [[mental health]] problems; and assistance for the [[homeless]].\n\nThe national Church has never shied from involvement in [[Scottish politics]]. In 1919, the General Assembly created a Church and Nation Committee, which in 2005 became the [[Church and Society Council]]. The Church of Scotland was (and is) a firm opponent of [[nuclear weapon]]ry. Supporting [[devolution]], it was one of the parties involved in the [[Scottish Constitutional Convention]], which resulted in the setting up of the [[Scottish Parliament]] in 1997. Indeed, from 1999\u20132004 the Parliament met in the Kirk's [[General Assembly Hall of the Church of Scotland|Assembly Hall]] in Edinburgh, while its own building was being constructed. The Church of Scotland actively supports the work of the [[Scottish Churches Parliamentary Office]] in Edinburgh.\n\nOther Church agencies include:\n*Assembly Arrangements Committee\n*Committee on Chaplains to HM Forces\n*Church of Scotland Guild\n*Committee on Church Art and Architecture ''(part of the Mission and Discipleship Council)''\n*Ecumenical Relations Committee\n*Stewardship and Finance Department\n*General Trustees ''(responsible for church buildings)''\n*Legal Questions Committee\n*Panel on Review and Reform\n*Department of the General Assembly\n*Safeguarding Service ''(protection of children and vulnerable adults)\n\n===Church offices===\n{{Main|Church of Scotland Offices}}\n[[File:Church of Scotland Offices, Edinburgh.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|Church of Scotland Offices, George Street, Edinburgh 2013]]\nThe Church of Scotland Offices are located at 121 [[George Street, Edinburgh]]. These imposing buildings\u2014popularly known in Church circles as \"one-two-one\"\u2014were designed in a Scandinavian-influenced style by the architect Sydney Mitchell and built in 1909\u20131911 for the United Free Church of Scotland. Following the union of the churches in 1929 a matching extension was built in the 1930s.\n\nThe offices of the Moderator, Principal Clerk, General Treasurer, Law Department and all the Church councils are located at 121 George Street, with the exception of the Social Care Council (CrossReach). The Principal Clerk to the General Assembly is the Rev Dr George Whyte. Each Council has its own Council Secretary who sit as a senior management team led by the Secretary to the Council of Assembly, currently the Rev Dr Martin Scott.\n\n==Publications==\nThe following publications are useful sources of information about the Church of Scotland.\n* ''[[Life and Work (magazine)|Life and Work]]'' \u2013 the monthly magazine of the Church of Scotland.\n* ''[[Church of Scotland Yearbook]]'' (known as \"the red book\") \u2013 published annually with [[Statistics|statistical data]] on every parish and contact information for every minister.\n* ''Reports to the General Assembly'' (known as \"the blue book\") \u2013 published annually with reports on the work of the church's departments.\n* ''The Constitution and Laws of the Church of Scotland'' (known as \"the green book\") edited by the Very Rev Dr [[James Weatherhead|James L.

Scotland's true character as a Presbyterian nation enjoying the benefits of civil and religious liberty'. What they had in mind was the mission established by Columba at Iona and the subsequent spread of Christianity through the Culdees of the seventh to eleventh centuries. For Presbyterian scholars in the nineteenth century, these communities of clergy who differed in organisation and ethos from later monastic orders were further evidence of the similarity between early Christianity in Ireland and Scotland and later Presbyterianism. This interpretation of the character of the Celtic Church was an important aspect of Presbyterian identity in global terms. At the first meeting in 1877 of the Alliance of the Reformed Churches holding the Presbyterian System (later the World Alliance of Reformed Churches), Peter Lorimer (1812-79), a Presbyterian professor in London, noted 'that the early Church of St. Patrick, Columba, and Columbanus, was far more nearly allied in its fundamental principles of order and discipline to the Presbyterian than to the Episcopalian Churches of modern times'.}}</ref><ref name=\"TaylorAnderson1852\">{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=James |last2=Anderson|first2=John |title=The Pictorial History of Scotland|year=1852|language=English|page=51|quote=The zealous Presbyterian maintains, that the church established by Columba was formed on a Presbyterian model, and that it recognized the great principle of clerical equality.}}</ref><ref name=\"Bradley2013\">{{cite book|last=Bradley|first=Ian|title=Columba|date=24 July 2013|publisher=Wild Goose Publications|language=English|isbn=9781849522724|page=29|quote=Columba has found favour with enthusiasts for all things Celtic and with those who have seen him as establishing a proto-Presbyterian church clearly distinguishable from the episcopally goverened church favoured by Rome-educated Bishop Ninian.}}</ref> Tracing their apostolic origin to [[John the Apostle|Saint John]],<ref name=\"DickensLewis1920\">{{cite journal|last=Dickens-Lewis|first=W.F.|year=1920|title=Apostolicity of Presbyterianism: Ancient Culdeeism and Modern Presbyterianism|journal=The Presbyterian Magazine|publisher=[[Presbyterian Church (USA)]]|volume=26|issue=1\u20137|page=529|quote=The Culdees who claimed at the Synod of Whitby apostolic descent from St. John, as against the Romish claim of the authority of St. Peter, retired into Scotland.}}</ref><ref name=\"Thomson1896\">{{cite book|last=Thomson|first=Thomas|title=A History of the Scottish People from the Earliest Times|url=https://archive.org/details/ahistoryscottis00annagoog|year=1896|publisher=Blackie|language=English|page=[https://archive.org/details/ahistoryscottis00annagoog/page/n181 141]|quote=...for the primitive apostolic church which St. John had established in the East and Columba transported to our shores.

It reformed its doctrines and government, drawing on the principles of [[John Calvin]] which Knox had been exposed to while living in [[Geneva]], Switzerland. In 1560, an assembly of some nobles, lairds and burgesses, as well as several churchmen, claiming in defiance of the Queen to be a Scottish Parliament, abolished papal jurisdiction and approved the ''[[Scots Confession]]'', but did not accept many of the principles laid out in Knox's ''[[First Book of Discipline]]'', which argued, among other things, that all of the assets of the old church should pass to the new. The 1560 [[Scottish Reformation#Reformation Settlement of 1560|Reformation Settlement]] was not ratified by the crown, as [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary I]], a Catholic, refused to do so, and the question of [[Ecclesiastical polity|church government]] also remained unresolved. {{citation needed|date=February 2020}} In 1572 the acts of 1560 were finally approved by the young [[James VI]], but the [[Concordat of Leith]] also allowed the crown to appoint bishops with the church's approval. John Knox himself had no clear views on the office of bishop, preferring to see them renamed as 'superintendents' which is a translation of the Greek; but in response to the new Concordat a Presbyterian party emerged headed by [[Andrew Melville]], the author of the ''[[Second Book of Discipline]]''. {{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nMelville and his supporters enjoyed some temporary successes\u2014most notably in the Golden Act of 1592, which gave parliamentary approval to Presbyterian courts. James VI, who succeeded to the English throne in 1603, believed that Presbyterianism was incompatible with monarchy, declaring \"No bishop, no king\"<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Established Church of Scotland}}</ref> and by skillful manipulation of both church and state, steadily reintroduced parliamentary and then diocesan [[episcopal polity|episcopacy]]. By the time he died in 1625, the Church of Scotland had a full panel of bishops and archbishops. General Assemblies met only at times and places approved by the Crown. {{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n[[File:Reformed Scots Church Denominations.svg|thumb|right|upright=2.25| Timeline of the evolution of the churches of Scotland from the Reformation]]\n[[Charles I of England|Charles I]] inherited a settlement in Scotland based on a balanced compromise between Calvinist doctrine and episcopal practice. Lacking the political judgement of his father, he began to upset this by moving into more dangerous areas. Disapproving of the 'plainness' of the Scottish service he, together with his [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[William Laud]], sought to introduce the kind of liturgical practice in use in England. The centrepiece of this new strategy was the Prayer Book of 1637, a slightly modified version of the Anglican ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]''. Although this was devised by a panel of Scottish bishops, Charles' insistence that it be drawn up in secret and adopted sight-unseen led to widespread discontent. When the Prayer Book was finally introduced at [[St Giles Cathedral]] in Edinburgh in mid-1637 it caused an outbreak of rioting, which, starting with [[Jenny Geddes]], spread across Scotland. In early 1638 the [[National Covenant]] was signed by large numbers of Scots, protesting at the introduction of the Prayer Book and other liturgical innovations that had not first been tested and approved by free Parliaments and General Assemblies of the Church. In November 1638, the General Assembly in Glasgow, the first to meet for twenty years, not only declared the Prayer Book unlawful, but went on to abolish the office of bishop itself. The Church of Scotland was then established on a Presbyterian basis. Charles' attempt at resistance to these developments led to the outbreak of the [[Bishops' Wars]]. In the ensuing civil wars, the Scots [[Covenanters]] at one point made common cause with the English parliamentarians\u2014resulting in the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] being agreed by both. This document remains the [[subordinate standard]] of the Church of Scotland, but was replaced in England after the [[English Restoration|Restoration]]. {{citation needed|date=February 2020}}O\n\nEpiscopacy was reintroduced to Scotland after the Restoration, the cause of considerable discontent, especially in the south-west of the country, where the Presbyterian tradition was strongest. The modern situation largely dates from 1690, when after the [[Glorious Revolution]] the majority of Scottish bishops were [[Nonjuring schism|non-jurors]], that is, they believed they could not swear allegiance to [[William III of England|William II]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] while [[James VII]] lived. To reduce their influence the Scots Parliament guaranteed Presbyterian governance of the Church by law, excluding what became the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]]. Most of the remaining Covenanters, disagreeing with the Restoration Settlement on various political and theological grounds, most notably because the Settlement did not acknowledge the National Covenant and Solemn League and Covenant, also did not join the Church of Scotland, instead forming the [[Reformed Presbyterian Church of Scotland]] in 1690. {{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nControversy still surrounded the relationship between the Church of Scotland's independence and the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] of Scotland. The interference of civil courts with Church decisions, particularly over the appointment of ministers, following the [[Church Patronage (Scotland) Act 1711]], which gave landowners, or patrons, the right to appoint ministers to vacant pulpits, would lead to several splits. This began with the [[First Secession|secession of 1733]] and culminated in the [[Disruption of 1843]], when a large portion of the Church broke away to form the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Church of Scotland]]. The seceding groups tended to divide and reunite among themselves\u2014leading to a proliferation of Presbyterian denominations in Scotland.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n[[File:Old logo of the CoS.png|thumb|right|upright|Older rectangular logo of the Church of Scotland.]]\nThe [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] passed the [[Church of Scotland Act 1921]], finally recognising the full independence of the Church in matters spiritual, and as a result of this, and passage of the Church of Scotland (Property and Endowments) Act 1925, the Kirk was able to unite with the [[United Free Church of Scotland]] in 1929. The United Free Church of Scotland was itself the product of the union of the former [[United Presbyterian Church of Scotland]] and the majority of the Free Church of Scotland in 1900.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nSome independent Scottish Presbyterian denominations still remain. These include the [[Free Church of Scotland (post 1900)|Free Church of Scotland]]\u2014sometimes given the epithet [[Wee Free|The Wee Frees]]\u2014(originally formed of those congregations which refused to unite with the [[United Presbyterian Church of Scotland|United Presbyterian Church]] in 1900), the [[United Free Church of Scotland]] (formed of congregations which refused to unite with the Church of Scotland in 1929), the [[Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland]] (which broke from the Free Church of Scotland in 1893), the [[Associated Presbyterian Churches]] (which emerged as a result of a split in the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland in the 1980s) and the [[Free Church of Scotland (Continuing)]] (which emerged from a split in the Free Church of Scotland in 2000).{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n[[File:NecTamenConsumebatur.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Stained glass showing the burning bush and the motto \"nec tamen consumebatur\", [[St. Mungo's Cathedral, Glasgow]].]]\n\nThe motto of the Church of Scotland is ''nec tamen consumebatur'' ([[Latin (language)|Latin]])\u2014\"Yet it was not consumed\", an allusion to Exodus 3:2 and the [[Burning Bush]].\n\n==Theology and practice==\nThe basis of faith for the Church of Scotland is the ''Word of God'', which it views as being \"contained in the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament\". Its principal subordinate standard is ''[[Westminster Confession of Faith|The Westminster Confession of Faith]]'' (1647), although here liberty of opinion is granted on those matters \"which do not enter into the substance of the faith\" (Art. 2 and 5). (The 19th century Scottish distinction was between '[[evangelicals]]' and '[[Moderate Party (Scotland)|moderates]]'.) There is no official document in which substantial matters and insubstantial ones are clearly demarcated.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe Church of Scotland has no compulsory [[prayer book]], although it does have a [[Hymnbooks of the Church of Scotland|hymn book]] (the 4th edition was published in 2005). Its ''[[Book of Common Order]]'' contains recommendations for public worship, which are usually followed fairly closely in the case of sacraments and ordinances. Preaching is the central focus of most services. Traditionally, Scots worship centred on the singing of [[Metrical psalter|metrical psalm]]s and paraphrases, but for generations these have been supplemented with [[Christian music]] of all types.<ref name=\"Bowden2005\"/> The typical Church of Scotland service lasts about an hour. There is normally no sung or responsive liturgy, but worship is the responsibility of the minister in each parish, and the style of worship can vary and be quite experimental. In recent years, a variety of modern song books have been widely used to appeal more to contemporary trends in music, and elements from alternative liturgies including those of the [[Iona Community]] are incorporated in some congregations. Although traditionally worship is conducted by the parish minister, participation and leadership by members who are not ministers in services is becoming more frequent, especially in the Highlands and the Borders.\n\nIn common with other [[Reformed]] denominations, the Church recognises two [[sacraments]]: [[Baptism]] and Holy Communion (the [[Eucharist|Lord's Supper]]). The Church baptises both believing adults and the children of Christian families. Communion in the Church of Scotland today is open to Christians of whatever denomination, without precondition. Communion services are usually taken fairly seriously in the Church; traditionally, a congregation held only three or four per year, although practice now greatly varies between congregations. In some congregations, communion is celebrated once a month.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nTheologically, the Church of Scotland is Reformed (ultimately in the [[Calvinist]] tradition) and is a member of the [[World Alliance of Reformed Churches]].<ref name=\"WCRC2018\"/>\n\n===Ecumenical relations===\nThe Church of Scotland is a member of ACTS ([[Action of Churches Together in Scotland]]) and, through its Committee on Ecumenical Relations, works closely with other denominations in Scotland. The present inter-denominational co-operation marks a distinct change from attitudes in certain quarters of the Church in the early twentieth century and before, when opposition to Irish Roman Catholic immigration was vocal (see [[Roman Catholicism in Scotland|Catholicism in Scotland]]). The Church of Scotland is a member of the [[World Council of Churches]], the [[Conference of European Churches]], the [[Community of Protestant Churches in Europe]], and the [[World Communion of Reformed Churches]]. The Church of Scotland is a member of [[Churches Together in Britain and Ireland]] and, through its Presbytery of England, is a member of [[Churches Together in England]]. The Church of Scotland continues to foster relationships with other Presbyterian denominations in Scotland even where agreement is difficult.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} In May 2016 the Church of Scotland ratified the Columba Agreement (approved by the Church of England's General Synod in February 2016), calling for the two churches to work more closely together on matters of common interest.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n===\"God's Invitation\"===\nWhile the Bible is the basis of faith of the Church of Scotland, and the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] is the subordinate standard,<ref>''Ordinal and Service Book'', Open University Press 1931</ref><ref>[http://www.churchofscotland.org.uk/about_us/our_faith/westminster_confession_of_faith Westminster Confession of Faith] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022093419/http://www.churchofscotland.org.uk/about_us/our_faith/westminster_confession_of_faith |date=22 October 2016 }} page at Church of Scotland website</ref> a request was presented to a General Assembly of the Church of Scotland for a statement explaining the historic Christian faith in [[jargon]]-free non-theological language. \"God's Invitation\" was prepared to fulfil that request.

The Kirk also pools its resources to ensure continuation of this presence.\n\nThe Kirk played a leading role in providing [[Universal education|universal]] [[education in Scotland]] (the first such provision in the modern world), largely due to its teaching that all should be able to read the Bible. Today it does not operate schools, as these were transferred to the state in the latter half of the 19th century.\n\n==Governance and administration==\n{{see also|List of Church of Scotland parishes|List of Church of Scotland synods and presbyteries|Presbyterian church governance}}\n\nThe Church of Scotland is [[Presbyterian]] in polity and [[Reformed]] in theology. The most recent articulation of its legal position, the ''[[Articles Declaratory of the Constitution of the Church of Scotland|Articles Declaratory]]'' (1921), spells out the key concepts.\n\n===Courts and assemblies===\nAs a Presbyterian church, the Kirk has no bishops but is rather governed by elders and ministers (collectively called presbyters) sitting in a series of courts. Each congregation is led by a [[Kirk Session]]. The Kirk Sessions in turn are answerable to regional [[Presbyterian polity#Presbytery|presbyteries]] (of which the Kirk currently has [[List of Church of Scotland synods and presbyteries|over 40]]). The supreme body is the annual [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland|General Assembly]], which meets each May in [[Edinburgh]].\n\n===Moderator===\nEach court is convened by the '[[Moderators and clerks in the Church of Scotland|moderator]]'\u2014at the local level of the Kirk Session normally the parish minister who is ''ex officio'' member and Moderator of the Session. Congregations where there is no minister, or where the minister is incapacitated may be moderated by a specially trained elder. Presbyteries and the General Assembly elect a moderator each year. The [[Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland|Moderator of the General Assembly]] serves for the year as the public representative of the Church\u2014but beyond that enjoys no special powers or privileges and is in no sense the leader or official spokesperson of the Kirk. At all levels, moderators may be either elders or ministers. Only Moderators of Kirk Sessions are obliged to be trained for the role.\n\n===Councils===\n[[File:CofSBurningBushLogo.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Burning Bush]] emblem of the Church of Scotland, above the entrance to the [[Church of Scotland Offices|Church Offices]] in Edinburgh]]\nAt a national level, the work of the Church of Scotland is chiefly carried out by \"Councils\", each supported by full-time staff mostly based at the [[Church of Scotland Offices]] in Edinburgh. The Councils are:\n*Council of Assembly\n*[[Church and Society Council]]\n*Ministries Council\n*Mission and Discipleship Council\n*Social Care Council ''(based at Charis House, Edinburgh)''\n*World Mission Council\n\nThe Church of Scotland's Social Care Council (known as [http://www.crossreach.org.uk CrossReach]) is the largest provider of [[Social work|social care]] in Scotland today, running projects for various disadvantaged and vulnerable groups: including care for the elderly; help with alcoholism, drug, and [[mental health]] problems; and assistance for the [[homeless]].\n\nThe national Church has never shied from involvement in [[Scottish politics]]. In 1919, the General Assembly created a Church and Nation Committee, which in 2005 became the [[Church and Society Council]]. The Church of Scotland was (and is) a firm opponent of [[nuclear weapon]]ry. Supporting [[devolution]], it was one of the parties involved in the [[Scottish Constitutional Convention]], which resulted in the setting up of the [[Scottish Parliament]] in 1997. Indeed, from 1999\u20132004 the Parliament met in the Kirk's [[General Assembly Hall of the Church of Scotland|Assembly Hall]] in Edinburgh, while its own building was being constructed. The Church of Scotland actively supports the work of the [[Scottish Churches Parliamentary Office]] in Edinburgh.\n\nOther Church agencies include:\n*Assembly Arrangements Committee\n*Committee on Chaplains to HM Forces\n*Church of Scotland Guild\n*Committee on Church Art and Architecture ''(part of the Mission and Discipleship Council)''\n*Ecumenical Relations Committee\n*Stewardship and Finance Department\n*General Trustees ''(responsible for church buildings)''\n*Legal Questions Committee\n*Panel on Review and Reform\n*Department of the General Assembly\n*Safeguarding Service ''(protection of children and vulnerable adults)\n\n===Church offices===\n{{Main|Church of Scotland Offices}}\n[[File:Church of Scotland Offices, Edinburgh.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|Church of Scotland Offices, George Street, Edinburgh 2013]]\nThe Church of Scotland Offices are located at 121 [[George Street, Edinburgh]]. These imposing buildings\u2014popularly known in Church circles as \"one-two-one\"\u2014were designed in a Scandinavian-influenced style by the architect Sydney Mitchell and built in 1909\u20131911 for the United Free Church of Scotland. Following the union of the churches in 1929 a matching extension was built in the 1930s.\n\nThe offices of the Moderator, Principal Clerk, General Treasurer, Law Department and all the Church councils are located at 121 George Street, with the exception of the Social Care Council (CrossReach). The Principal Clerk to the General Assembly is the Rev Dr George Whyte. Each Council has its own Council Secretary who sit as a senior management team led by the Secretary to the Council of Assembly, currently the Rev Dr Martin Scott.\n\n==Publications==\nThe following publications are useful sources of information about the Church of Scotland.\n* ''[[Life and Work (magazine)|Life and Work]]'' \u2013 the monthly magazine of the Church of Scotland.\n* ''[[Church of Scotland Yearbook]]'' (known as \"the red book\") \u2013 published annually with [[Statistics|statistical data]] on every parish and contact information for every minister.\n* ''Reports to the General Assembly'' (known as \"the blue book\") \u2013 published annually with reports on the work of the church's departments.\n* ''The Constitution and Laws of the Church of Scotland'' (known as \"the green book\") edited by the Very Rev Dr [[James Weatherhead|James L.

The show features a [[quiz]] competition in which contestants are presented with [[general knowledge]] clues in the form of answers, and must phrase their responses in the form of questions. The original daytime version debuted on [[NBC]] on March 30, 1964, and aired until January 3, 1975. A weekly nighttime [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] edition aired from September 1974 to September 1975, and a revival, ''The All-New Jeopardy!'', ran on NBC from October 1978 to March 1979. The current version, a daily syndicated show produced by [[Sony Pictures Television]], premiered on September 10, 1984.\n\nBoth NBC versions and the weekly syndicated version were hosted by [[Art Fleming]]. [[Don Pardo]] served as announcer until 1975, and [[John Harlan (announcer)|John Harlan]] announced for the 1978\u20131979 season.

The contestants compete in a quiz game comprising three rounds: Jeopardy!, Double Jeopardy!, and Final Jeopardy!{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} The material for the clues covers a wide variety of topics, including history and current events, the sciences, the arts, popular culture, literature, and languages.{{Sfn|Eisenberg|1993}} Category titles often feature puns, wordplay, or shared themes, and the host will regularly remind contestants of topics or place emphasis on category themes before the start of the round.\n\nAll clues in the show are presented as \"answers\", and responses must be phrased in the form of a question.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} For example, if a contestant were to select \"Presidents for $200\", the resulting clue could be \"This 'Father of Our Country' didn't really chop down a cherry tree\", to which the correct response would be \"Who is/was [[George Washington]]?\" (Contestants are free to phrase the response in the form of any question; the traditional phrasing of \"who is/are\" for people or \"what is/are\" for things or words is almost always used.) When the correct response is the name of a person, the [[surname]] is sufficient except in categories where the host explicitly states the full name is required or the surname is not sufficiently unambiguous. \n\n===First two rounds===\n[[File:Jeopardy game board.png|thumb|255px|left|The layout of the ''Jeopardy!'' game board since November 26, 2001, showing the dollar values used in the first round. Categories at the top of the board vary between each round and episode.]]\n\nThe Jeopardy! and Double Jeopardy! rounds each feature six categories, each of which contains five clues, which are ostensibly valued by difficulty.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} The dollar values of the clues increased over time. On the original ''Jeopardy!'' series, clue values in the first round ranged from $10 to $50.{{Sfn|Harris|2006|p=13}} On ''The All-New Jeopardy!'', they ranged from $25\u2013$125. In the two pilots that led to the current series, the first kept the $25\u2013$125 values for the Jeopardy! round, while the second doubled these to $50\u2013$250. The current series' first round originally ranged from $100\u2013$500 (doubled again from the second pilot),{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} and was doubled to $200\u2013$1,000 on November 26, 2001.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Show No. 3966 (Harold Skinner vs. Geoffrey Zimmermann vs. Kristin Lawhead)|series=Jeopardy!|network=Syndicated|airdate=November 26, 2001}}</ref>\n\nThe Jeopardy! round begins when the returning champion selects any position on the game board. The underlying clue is revealed and read aloud by the host, after which any contestant may ring-in using a [[lock-out device|hand-held signaling device]]. The first contestant to ring-in successfully is prompted to provide a response to the clue. If the contestant responds correctly, the clue's dollar value is added to the contestant's score, and they may select a new clue from the board. An incorrect response, or a failure to respond within five seconds, deducts the clue's value from the contestant's score and allows the other contestants the opportunity to ring in and respond. If the response is not technically incorrect but otherwise judged to be too vague to be deemed the correct response, the contestant is given additional time to provide a more specific response.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} Whenever none of the contestants ring in and respond correctly, the host gives the correct response and the \"last correct questioner\" chooses the next clue.<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\">{{Cite book|title=Jeopardy! DVD Home Game System Instruction Booklet|year=2007|publisher=[[MGA Entertainment]]}}</ref>\n\nContestants are encouraged to select the clues in order from lowest to highest value, as the show's writers write the clues in each category to flow from one to the next, as is the case with game shows that ask questions in a linear string. Contestants are not required to do so unless the category requires clues to be taken in order; the \"Forrest Bounce\", a strategy in which contestants randomly pick clues to confuse opponents, has been used successfully by [[Arthur Chu]] and the strategy's namesake [[Chuck Forrest]], despite Trebek noting that the strategy not only annoys him but staffers as well since it also disrupts the rhythm that develops when revealing the clues and increases the potential for error.<ref>{{cite web|first=David|last=Marchese|url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/alex-trebek-jeopardy-in-conversation.html|title=In Conversation: Alex Trebek|work=Vulture.com|date=November 12, 2018|accessdate=November 13, 2018|quote=What bothers me is when contestants jump all over the board even after the Daily Doubles have been dealt with. Why are they doing that? They\u2019re doing themselves a disservice. When the show's writers construct categories they do it so that there's a flow in terms of difficulty, and if you jump to the bottom of the category you may get a clue that would be easier to understand if you\u2019d begun at the top of the category and saw how the clues worked.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113001332/https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/alex-trebek-jeopardy-in-conversation.html|archive-date=November 13, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Another unorthodox strategy is to sweep through the highest values on the board first; if successful, this has several advantages: the player will have more money to wager on Daily Doubles, and other players will have to answer more questions correctly to earn the same amount of money. [[James Holzhauer]], whose April\u2013June 2019 winning streak included the ten highest single-day money totals in the show's history, regularly used this strategy, in conjunction with the Forrest Bounce and aggressive Daily Double wagering.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.today.com/popculture/jeopardy-winner-james-holzhauer-sets-sights-new-record-t152397|title=A Las Vegas pro gambler is rewriting the 'Jeopardy!' record book \u2014 here's how|first=Scott|last=Stump|work=[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]|date=April 18, 2019|accessdate=April 20, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190420122141/https://www.today.com/popculture/jeopardy-winner-james-holzhauer-sets-sights-new-record-t152397|archive-date=April 20, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFrom the premiere of the original ''Jeopardy!'' until the end of the first season of the current syndicated series, contestants were allowed to ring in as soon as the clue was revealed. Since September 1985, contestants are required to wait until the clue is read before ringing in. To accommodate the rule change, lights were added to the game board (unseen by home viewers) to signify when it is permissible for contestants to signal;{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|pp=59\u201360}} attempting to signal before the light goes on locks the contestant out for half of a second.{{Sfn|Richmond|2004|p=41}} The change was made to allow the home audience to play along with the show more easily and to keep an extremely fast contestant from potentially dominating the game. In pre-1985 episodes, a buzzer would sound when a contestant signaled; according to Trebek, the buzzer was eliminated because it was \"distracting to the viewers\" and sometimes presented a problem when contestants rang in while Trebek was still reading the clue.{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|pp=59\u201360}} Contestants who are visually impaired or blind are given a card with the category names printed in [[Braille]] before each round begins, and an audible tone is played after the clue has been read aloud. The second round, Double Jeopardy!, features six new categories of clues. Clue values are doubled from the Jeopardy! round.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} The contestant with the least amount of money at the end of the Jeopardy! round makes the first selection in the Double Jeopardy! round;<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\"/> if there is a tie, the tied contestant standing at the leftmost lectern (from the host's perspective) selects first.\n\nA \"Daily Double\" is hidden behind one clue in the Jeopardy! round, and two in Double Jeopardy!{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} The name and inspiration were taken from a [[horse racing]] [[Daily double|term]].{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|pp=2\u20133}} Daily Double clues with a sound or video component are known as \"Audio Daily Doubles\" and \"Video Daily Doubles\" respectively. Before the clue is revealed, the contestant who selects the Daily Double must declare a wager, from a minimum of $5 to a maximum of his/her entire score (known as a \"true Daily Double\") or the highest clue value available in the round, whichever is greater.<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\"/><ref name=\"5-rules\">{{cite web|title=5 Rules Every Jeopardy!

In the Double Jeopardy! round and in the Daily Double in the Jeopardy! round, the phrasing rule is followed more strictly, with a response not phrased in the form of a question counting as wrong if it is not re-phrased before the host or judges make a ruling.<ref name=\"5-rules\" />\n\nIf it is determined that a previous response was wrongly ruled to be correct or incorrect during the taping of an episode, the scores are adjusted at the first available opportunity (typically after the Jeopardy!, Double Jeopardy! rounds, the first break, or a Daily Double break).

At the end of the Double Jeopardy! round, the host announces the Final Jeopardy! category and a commercial break follows. During the break, partitions are placed between the contestant lecterns, and each contestant makes a final wager; they may wager any amount of their earnings, but may not wager certain numbers with connotations that are deemed inappropriate ([[69 (sex position)|69]], [[Number of the Beast|666]], and [[Fourteen Words|1488]] are among the forbidden wagers, though [[Triskadekaphobia|13]], [[420 (cannabis culture)|420]], and [[September 11 attacks|911]] are allowed).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/jeopardy-players-cant-wagers-nodding-144821770.html |title='Jeopardy' players aren't allowed to make wagers referencing sex, Nazis, or Satan |access-date=May 1, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190501121047/https://news.yahoo.com/jeopardy-players-cant-wagers-nodding-144821770.html |archive-date=May 1, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Contestants write their wagers using a [[light pen]] on an electronic display on their lectern.{{Sfn|Dutta|1999|p=xxix}} After the break, the Final Jeopardy! clue is revealed and read by the host. The contestants have 30 seconds to write their responses on the electronic display, while the show's iconic [[Jeopardy!#Theme music|\"Think!\" music]] plays in the background. In the event that either the display or the pen malfunctions, contestants can use an [[index card]] and a marker to manually write their response and wager. Visually impaired or blind contestants use a [[Braille]] keyboard to type in a wager and response.\n\nIn the rare occurrences where there is only one contestant remaining, that contestant automatically wins unless (s)he wagers his or her entire score (which has never been attempted in such a situation) and loses. Otherwise, contestants' responses are revealed in order of their pre-Final Jeopardy! scores from lowest to highest. Players who are tied after Double Jeopardy! have their responses revealed from right to left from the viewer's perspective. As soon as the first correct response is revealed the host confirms it to be so, usually including some brief context, otherwise, the host only reveals the correct response with context after all responses are revealed to be incorrect. A correct response adds the amount of the contestant's wager to his/her score, while a miss, failure to respond, insufficiently specific response or failure to phrase the response as a question (even if correct) deducts it.<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\"/> Misspelling is not penalized so long as the spelling does not affect the pronunciation of the word.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://jeremiahstanghini.com/2013/08/05/the-official-final-jeopardy-spelling-rules/ |title=The Official Final Jeopardy Spelling Rules [UPDATED] |date=August 5, 2013 |accessdate=October 31, 2019 |first=Jeremiah |last=Stanghini}}</ref>\n\nThe contestant with the highest score at the end of the round is that day's winner. If there is a tie for second place, consolation prizes are awarded based on the scores going into the Final Jeopardy! round. If all three contestants finish with $0, no one returns as champion for the next show, and based on scores going into the Final Jeopardy! round, the two contestants who were first and second will receive the second-place prize, and the contestant in third will receive the third-place prize.\n\nThe strategy for wagering in Final Jeopardy! has been studied.

The show pays for travel for returning champions and players invited back because of errors who must make multiple trips to Los Angeles. If a tournament travels (does not stay in Los Angeles) on the second week, the show pays for travel.{{Sfn|Jennings|2006|p=122}}\n\nDuring Art Fleming's hosting run, all three contestants received their winnings in cash (contestants who finished with a negative score were not required to pay) and parting gifts, usually an encyclopedia set. This was changed at the start of Trebek's hosting run to avoid the problem of contestants who would stop participating in the game, or avoid wagering in Final Jeopardy!, rather than risk losing the money they had already won; this also allowed the show to increase the clue values since only one contestant's score would have to be paid instead of three.{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|p=57}} From 1984 to 2002, non-winning contestants on the Trebek version received vacation packages and merchandise, which were donated by manufacturers as promotional consideration. Since 2004, a presenting sponsor has provided cash prizes to the losing contestants ({{as of|2019}}, [[GEICO]] serves as the presenting sponsor of the consolation prizes, except for the Tournaments, which are sponsored by [[Consumer Cellular]]).{{Sfn|Mogel|2004|p=148}}\n\n===Returning champions===\nThe winner of each episode returns to compete against two new contestants on the next episode.

In all situations with three new contestants (most notably, unseeded tournaments in the first round), the draw will also determine who will take the champion's position and select first to start the game. (The player scoring the highest in the preceding round will be given the chance to select first in the semi-final and finals.)\n\n===Variations for tournament play===\nTournaments generally run for 10 consecutive episodes and feature 15 contestants. The first five episodes, the quarter-finals, feature three new contestants each day. Other than in the Tournament of Champions, the quarter-finals are unseeded and contestants participate in a random draw to determine playing order and lectern positions over the course of the five games. The Tournament of Champions is seeded based on total winnings in regular games to determine playing order and lectern positions, with the top five players occupying the champion's lectern for the quarter-final games.\n\nThe winners of the five quarter-final games and the four highest-scoring non-winners (\"wild cards\"), advance to the semi-finals, which run for three days. The semi-finals are seeded with the quarter-final winners being seeded 1\u20135 based on their quarter-final scores and the wild cards being seeded 6\u20139. The winners of the quarter-final games with the three highest scores occupy the champion's lectern for the semi-finals. The winners of the three semi-final games advance to play in a two-game final match, in which the scores from both games are combined to determine the overall standings. This format has been used since the first Tournament of Champions in 1985 and was devised by Trebek himself.{{Sfn|Eisenberg|1993|p=75}}\n\nTo prevent later contestants from playing to beat the earlier wild card scores instead of playing to win, contestants are \"completely isolated from the studio until it is their time to compete\".{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|p=174}}\n\nIf there is a tie for the final wild-card position, the non-winner that advances will be based on the same regulations as two contestants who tie for second; the tie-breaker is the contestant's score after the Double Jeopardy! round, and if further tied, the score after the Jeopardy! round determines the contestant who advances as the wild card.\n\nIf two or more contestants tie for the highest score (greater than zero) at the end of the match (first round, semi-final game, or end of a two-game final), the standard tiebreaker is used. However, if two or more contestants tie for the highest score at the end of the first game of a two-game final, no tiebreaker is played.\n\nIf none of the contestants in a quarter-final or semi-final game end with a positive score, no contestant automatically qualifies from that game, and an additional wild card contestant advances instead.<ref name=\"Teen Tournament Semifinal\">{{Cite episode|title=Teen Tournament Semi-final Game 2 (Tori Amos vs. Joe Vertnik vs. Kelton Ellis)|series=Jeopardy!|network=Syndicated|date=February 7, 2013}}</ref> This occurred in the quarter-finals of the 1991 Seniors Tournament and the semi-finals of the 2013 Teen Tournament.<ref name=\"Teen Tournament Semifinal\"/>\n\nIn the finals, contestants who finish Double Jeopardy! with a $0 or negative score on either day do not play Final Jeopardy! that day. Their score for that leg is recorded as $0.\n\n==Conception and development==\nIn a 1964 [[Associated Press]] profile released shortly before the original ''Jeopardy!'' series premiered, [[Merv Griffin]] offered the following account of how he created the quiz show:\n{{quote|My wife Julann just came up with the idea one day when we were in a plane bringing us back to [[New York City]] from [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]].

The show features a [[quiz]] competition in which contestants are presented with [[general knowledge]] clues in the form of answers, and must phrase their responses in the form of questions. The original daytime version debuted on [[NBC]] on March 30, 1964, and aired until January 3, 1975. A weekly nighttime [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] edition aired from September 1974 to September 1975, and a revival, ''The All-New Jeopardy!'', ran on NBC from October 1978 to March 1979. The current version, a daily syndicated show produced by [[Sony Pictures Television]], premiered on September 10, 1984.\n\nBoth NBC versions and the weekly syndicated version were hosted by [[Art Fleming]]. [[Don Pardo]] served as announcer until 1975, and [[John Harlan (announcer)|John Harlan]] announced for the 1978\u20131979 season. Since its inception, the daily syndicated version has featured [[Alex Trebek]] as host and [[Johnny Gilbert]] as announcer.\n\nWith over 8,000 episodes aired,<ref name=\"Jeopardy 8000\">{{cite web|url=https://abc7chicago.com/entertainment/james-holzhauer-reaches-new-jeopardy-winnings-milestone/5315851/|title='Jeopardy!'

The contestants compete in a quiz game comprising three rounds: Jeopardy!, Double Jeopardy!, and Final Jeopardy!{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} The material for the clues covers a wide variety of topics, including history and current events, the sciences, the arts, popular culture, literature, and languages.{{Sfn|Eisenberg|1993}} Category titles often feature puns, wordplay, or shared themes, and the host will regularly remind contestants of topics or place emphasis on category themes before the start of the round.\n\nAll clues in the show are presented as \"answers\", and responses must be phrased in the form of a question.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} For example, if a contestant were to select \"Presidents for $200\", the resulting clue could be \"This 'Father of Our Country' didn't really chop down a cherry tree\", to which the correct response would be \"Who is/was [[George Washington]]?\" (Contestants are free to phrase the response in the form of any question; the traditional phrasing of \"who is/are\" for people or \"what is/are\" for things or words is almost always used.) When the correct response is the name of a person, the [[surname]] is sufficient except in categories where the host explicitly states the full name is required or the surname is not sufficiently unambiguous. \n\n===First two rounds===\n[[File:Jeopardy game board.png|thumb|255px|left|The layout of the ''Jeopardy!'' game board since November 26, 2001, showing the dollar values used in the first round. Categories at the top of the board vary between each round and episode.]]\n\nThe Jeopardy! and Double Jeopardy! rounds each feature six categories, each of which contains five clues, which are ostensibly valued by difficulty.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} The dollar values of the clues increased over time. On the original ''Jeopardy!'' series, clue values in the first round ranged from $10 to $50.{{Sfn|Harris|2006|p=13}} On ''The All-New Jeopardy!'', they ranged from $25-$125. In the two pilots that led to the current series, the first kept the $25-$125 values for the Jeopardy! round, while the second doubled these to $50\u2013$250. The current series' first round originally ranged from $100-$500 (doubled again from the second pilot),{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} and was doubled to $200-$1,000 on November 26, 2001.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Show No. 3966 (Harold Skinner vs. Geoffrey Zimmermann vs. Kristin Lawhead)|series=Jeopardy!|network=Syndicated|airdate=November 26, 2001}}</ref>\n\nThe Jeopardy! round begins when the returning champion selects any position on the game board. The underlying clue is revealed and read aloud by the host, after which any contestant may ring-in using a [[lock-out device|hand-held signaling device]]. The first contestant to ring-in successfully is prompted to provide a response to the clue. If the contestant responds correctly, the clue's dollar value is added to the contestant's score, and they may select a new clue from the board. An incorrect response, or a failure to respond within five seconds, deducts the clue's value from the contestant's score and allows the other contestants the opportunity to ring in and respond. If the response is not technically incorrect but otherwise judged to be too vague to be deemed the correct response, the contestant is given additional time to provide a more specific response.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} Whenever none of the contestants ring in and respond correctly, the host gives the correct response and the \"last correct questioner\" chooses the next clue.<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\">{{Cite book|title=Jeopardy! DVD Home Game System Instruction Booklet|year=2007|publisher=[[MGA Entertainment]]}}</ref>\n\nContestants are encouraged to select the clues in order from lowest to highest value, as the show's writers write the clues in each category to flow from one to the next, as is the case with game shows that ask questions in a linear string. Contestants are not required to do so unless the category requires clues to be taken in order; the \"Forrest Bounce\", a strategy in which contestants randomly pick clues to confuse opponents, has been used successfully by [[Arthur Chu]] and the strategy's namesake [[Chuck Forrest]], despite Trebek noting that the strategy not only annoys him but staffers as well since it also disrupts the rhythm that develops when revealing the clues and increases the potential for error.<ref>{{cite web|first=David|last=Marchese|url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/alex-trebek-jeopardy-in-conversation.html|title=In Conversation: Alex Trebek|work=Vulture.com|date=November 12, 2018|accessdate=November 13, 2018|quote=What bothers me is when contestants jump all over the board even after the Daily Doubles have been dealt with. Why are they doing that? They\u2019re doing themselves a disservice. When the show's writers construct categories they do it so that there's a flow in terms of difficulty, and if you jump to the bottom of the category you may get a clue that would be easier to understand if you\u2019d begun at the top of the category and saw how the clues worked.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113001332/https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/alex-trebek-jeopardy-in-conversation.html|archive-date=November 13, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Another unorthodox strategy is to sweep through the highest values on the board first; if successful, this has several advantages: the player will have more money to wager on Daily Doubles, and other players will have to answer more questions correctly to earn the same amount of money. [[James Holzhauer]], whose April\u2013June 2019 winning streak included the ten highest single-day money totals in the show's history, regularly used this strategy, in conjunction with the Forrest Bounce and aggressive Daily Double wagering.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.today.com/popculture/jeopardy-winner-james-holzhauer-sets-sights-new-record-t152397|title=A Las Vegas pro gambler is rewriting the 'Jeopardy!' record book \u2014 here's how|first=Scott|last=Stump|work=[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]|date=April 18, 2019|accessdate=April 20, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190420122141/https://www.today.com/popculture/jeopardy-winner-james-holzhauer-sets-sights-new-record-t152397|archive-date=April 20, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFrom the premiere of the original ''Jeopardy!'' until the end of the first season of the current syndicated series, contestants were allowed to ring in as soon as the clue was revealed. Since September 1985, contestants are required to wait until the clue is read before ringing in. To accommodate the rule change, lights were added to the game board (unseen by home viewers) to signify when it is permissible for contestants to signal;{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|pp=59\u201360}} attempting to signal before the light goes on locks the contestant out for half of a second.{{Sfn|Richmond|2004|p=41}} The change was made to allow the home audience to play along with the show more easily and to keep an extremely fast contestant from potentially dominating the game. In pre-1985 episodes, a buzzer would sound when a contestant signaled; according to Trebek, the buzzer was eliminated because it was \"distracting to the viewers\" and sometimes presented a problem when contestants rang in while Trebek was still reading the clue.{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|pp=59\u201360}} Contestants who are visually impaired or blind are given a card with the category names printed in [[Braille]] before each round begins, and an audible tone is played after the clue has been read aloud. The second round, Double Jeopardy!, features six new categories of clues. Clue values are doubled from the Jeopardy! round.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} The contestant with the least amount of money at the end of the Jeopardy! round makes the first selection in the Double Jeopardy! round;<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\"/> if there is a tie, the tied contestant standing at the leftmost lectern (from the host's perspective) selects first.\n\nA \"Daily Double\" is hidden behind one clue in the Jeopardy! round, and two in Double Jeopardy!{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} The name and inspiration were taken from a [[horse racing]] [[Daily double|term]].{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|pp=2\u20133}} Daily Double clues with a sound or video component are known as \"Audio Daily Doubles\" and \"Video Daily Doubles\" respectively. Before the clue is revealed, the contestant who selects the Daily Double must declare a wager, from a minimum of $5 to a maximum of his/her entire score (known as a \"true Daily Double\") or the highest clue value available in the round, whichever is greater.<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\"/><ref name=\"5-rules\">{{cite web|title=5 Rules Every Jeopardy!

Not answering the Daily Double also deducts the wager. Whether or not the contestant responds correctly, he or she chooses the next clue.<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\"/> Daily Doubles are usually hidden behind higher-valued questions, and almost never on the top row (only eight of the over 11,000 Daily Doubles since November 2001, 0.07%, have been in that location).<ref>{{cite web|title=Where are Daily Doubles located?|work=FiveThirtyEight|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/roeder-jeopardy-3.png?w=1150|accessdate=May 20, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424161628/https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/roeder-jeopardy-3.png?w=1150|archive-date=April 24, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nDuring the Jeopardy! round, except in response to the Daily Double clue, contestants are not penalized for forgetting to phrase their response in the form of a question, although the host will remind contestants to watch their phrasing in future responses. In the Double Jeopardy! round and in the Daily Double in the Jeopardy! round, the phrasing rule is followed more strictly, with a response not phrased in the form of a question counting as wrong if it is not re-phrased before the host or judges make a ruling.<ref name=\"5-rules\" />\n\nIf it is determined that a previous response was wrongly ruled to be correct or incorrect during the taping of an episode, the scores are adjusted at the first available opportunity (typically after the Jeopardy!, Double Jeopardy! rounds, the first break, or a Daily Double break). If it occurs after taping of an episode is completed, the affected contestant(s) are invited back to compete on a future show, complying with federal quiz show regulations.{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|p=64}}\n\nContestants who finish Double Jeopardy! with $0 or a negative score are automatically eliminated from the game at that point and awarded the third-place prize. On at least one episode hosted by Art Fleming, all three contestants finished Double Jeopardy! with $0 or less, and as a result, no Final Jeopardy! round was played.{{Sfn|Fabe|1979}} This rule is still in place for the Trebek version, although staff has suggested that it is not set in stone and that executive producer [[Harry Friedman]] may decide to display the clue for home viewers' play if such a situation were ever to occur.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jeopardy.com/jbuzz/features/four-rare-jeopardy-scenarios |title=Breaking Down Four Rare ''Jeopardy!''

During the break, partitions are placed between the contestant lecterns, and each contestant makes a final wager; they may wager any amount of their earnings, but may not wager certain numbers with connotations that are deemed inappropriate ([[69 (sex position)|69]], [[Number of the Beast|666]], and [[Fourteen Words|1488]] are among the forbidden wagers, though [[Triskadekaphobia|13]], [[420 (cannabis culture)|420]], and [[September 11 attacks|911]] are allowed).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/jeopardy-players-cant-wagers-nodding-144821770.html |title='Jeopardy' players aren't allowed to make wagers referencing sex, Nazis, or Satan |access-date=May 1, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190501121047/https://news.yahoo.com/jeopardy-players-cant-wagers-nodding-144821770.html |archive-date=May 1, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Contestants write their wagers using a [[light pen]] on an electronic display on their lectern.{{Sfn|Dutta|1999|p=xxix}} After the break, the Final Jeopardy! clue is revealed and read by the host. The contestants have 30 seconds to write their responses on the electronic display, while the show's iconic [[Jeopardy!#Theme music|\"Think!\" music]] plays in the background. In the event that either the display or the pen malfunctions, contestants can use an [[index card]] and a marker to manually write their response and wager. Visually impaired or blind contestants use a [[Braille]] keyboard to type in a wager and response.\n\nIn the rare occurrences where there is only one contestant remaining, that contestant automatically wins unless (s)he wagers his or her entire score (which has never been attempted in such a situation) and loses. Otherwise, contestants' responses are revealed in order of their pre-Final Jeopardy! scores from lowest to highest. Players who are tied after Double Jeopardy! have their responses revealed from right to left from the viewer's perspective. As soon as the first correct response is revealed the host confirms it to be so, usually including some brief context, otherwise, the host only reveals the correct response with context after all responses are revealed to be incorrect. A correct response adds the amount of the contestant's wager to his/her score, while a miss, failure to respond, insufficiently specific response or failure to phrase the response as a question (even if correct) deducts it.<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\"/> Misspelling is not penalized so long as the spelling does not affect the pronunciation of the word.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://jeremiahstanghini.com/2013/08/05/the-official-final-jeopardy-spelling-rules/ |title=The Official Final Jeopardy Spelling Rules [UPDATED] |date=August 5, 2013 |accessdate=October 31, 2019 |first=Jeremiah |last=Stanghini}}</ref>\n\nThe contestant with the highest score at the end of the round is that day's winner. If there is a tie for second place, consolation prizes are awarded based on the scores going into the Final Jeopardy! round. If all three contestants finish with $0, no one returns as champion for the next show, and based on scores going into the Final Jeopardy! round, the two contestants who were first and second will receive the second-place prize, and the contestant in third will receive the third-place prize.\n\nThe strategy for wagering in Final Jeopardy! has been studied. If the leader's score is more than twice the second place contestant's score, the leader can guarantee victory by making a sufficiently small wager.<ref name=\"gilbert-hatcher\">{{cite journal|last1=Gilbert|first1=George T.|last2=Hatcher|first2=Rhonda L.|title=Wagering in Final Jeopardy!|journal=Mathematics Magazine|date=October 1, 1994|volume=67|issue=4|pages=268|doi=10.2307/2690846|jstor=2690846}}</ref>{{rp|269}} Otherwise, according to ''Jeopardy!''

In the case of a tie, all tying top scorers were paid their winnings.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} Non-winners receive consolation prizes instead of their winnings in the game. Since May 16, 2002, consolation prizes have been $2,000 for the second-place contestant(s) and $1,000 for the third-place contestant.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Show No. 4089 (Ronnie O'Rourke vs. Ben Tritle vs. Allison Owens)|series=Jeopardy!|network=Syndicated|date=May 16, 2002}}</ref> Since the show does not generally provide travel or lodging for contestants, cash consolation prizes offset these costs. The show pays for travel for returning champions and players invited back because of errors who must make multiple trips to Los Angeles. If a tournament travels (does not stay in Los Angeles) on the second week, the show pays for travel.{{Sfn|Jennings|2006|p=122}}\n\nDuring Art Fleming's hosting run, all three contestants received their winnings in cash (contestants who finished with a negative score were not required to pay) and parting gifts, usually an encyclopedia set. This was changed at the start of Trebek's hosting run to avoid the problem of contestants who would stop participating in the game, or avoid wagering in Final Jeopardy!, rather than risk losing the money they had already won; this also allowed the show to increase the clue values since only one contestant's score would have to be paid instead of three.{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|p=57}} From 1984 to 2002, non-winning contestants on the Trebek version received vacation packages and merchandise, which were donated by manufacturers as promotional consideration. Since 2004, a presenting sponsor has provided cash prizes to the losing contestants ({{as of|2019}}, [[GEICO]] serves as the presenting sponsor of the consolation prizes, except for the Tournaments, which are sponsored by [[Consumer Cellular]]).{{Sfn|Mogel|2004|p=148}}\n\n===Returning champions===\nThe winner of each episode returns to compete against two new contestants on the next episode. Originally, a contestant who won five consecutive days retired undefeated and was guaranteed a spot in the Tournament of Champions; the five-day limit was eliminated at the beginning of season 20 on September 8, 2003.<ref>{{Cite press release|title=''Jeopardy!''

In all situations with three new contestants (most notably, unseeded tournaments in the first round), the draw will also determine who will take the champion's position and select first to start the game. (The player scoring the highest in the preceding round will be given the chance to select first in the semi-final and finals.)\n\n===Variations for tournament play===\nTournaments generally run for 10 consecutive episodes and feature 15 contestants. The first five episodes, the quarter-finals, feature three new contestants each day. Other than in the Tournament of Champions, the quarter-finals are unseeded and contestants participate in a random draw to determine playing order and lectern positions over the course of the five games. The Tournament of Champions is seeded based on total winnings in regular games to determine playing order and lectern positions, with the top five players occupying the champion's lectern for the quarter-final games.\n\nThe winners of the five quarter-final games and the four highest-scoring non-winners (\"wild cards\"), advance to the semi-finals, which run for three days. The semi-finals are seeded with the quarter-final winners being seeded 1\u20135 based on their quarter-final scores and the wild cards being seeded 6\u20139. The winners of the quarter-final games with the three highest scores occupy the champion's lectern for the semi-finals. The winners of the three semi-final games advance to play in a two-game final match, in which the scores from both games are combined to determine the overall standings. This format has been used since the first Tournament of Champions in 1985 and was devised by Trebek himself.{{Sfn|Eisenberg|1993|p=75}}\n\nTo prevent later contestants from playing to beat the earlier wild card scores instead of playing to win, contestants are \"completely isolated from the studio until it is their time to compete\".{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|p=174}}\n\nIf there is a tie for the final wild-card position, the non-winner that advances will be based on the same regulations as two contestants who tie for second; the tie-breaker is the contestant's score after the Double Jeopardy! round, and if further tied, the score after the Jeopardy! round determines the contestant who advances as the wild card.\n\nIf two or more contestants tie for the highest score (greater than zero) at the end of the match (first round, semi-final game, or end of a two-game final), the standard tiebreaker is used. However, if two or more contestants tie for the highest score at the end of the first game of a two-game final, no tiebreaker is played.\n\nIf none of the contestants in a quarter-final or semi-final game end with a positive score, no contestant automatically qualifies from that game, and an additional wild card contestant advances instead.<ref name=\"Teen Tournament Semifinal\">{{Cite episode|title=Teen Tournament Semi-final Game 2 (Tori Amos vs. Joe Vertnik vs. Kelton Ellis)|series=Jeopardy!|network=Syndicated|date=February 7, 2013}}</ref> This occurred in the quarter-finals of the 1991 Seniors Tournament and the semi-finals of the 2013 Teen Tournament.<ref name=\"Teen Tournament Semifinal\"/>\n\nIn the finals, contestants who finish Double Jeopardy! with a $0 or negative score on either day do not play Final Jeopardy! that day. Their score for that leg is recorded as $0.\n\n==Conception and development==\nIn a 1964 [[Associated Press]] profile released shortly before the original ''Jeopardy!'' series premiered, [[Merv Griffin]] offered the following account of how he created the quiz show:\n{{quote|My wife Julann just came up with the idea one day when we were in a plane bringing us back to [[New York City]] from [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]]. I was mulling over game show ideas, when she noted that there had not been a successful 'question and answer' game on the air since the [[1950s quiz show scandals|quiz show scandals]]. Why not do a switch, and give the answers to the contestant and let them come up with the question? She fired a couple of answers to me: \"5,280\"{{emdash}}and the question of course was 'How many feet in a mile?'. Another was '79 Wistful Vista'; that was [[Fibber McGee and Molly|Fibber and Mollie McGee's]] address.

Its most notable event was electing one of the first two women Members of the Provincial Parliament (MPP) to share the title \"first-woman MPP\" in 1943 when [[Rae Luckock]] was elected. In 1965, Bracondale's MPP, [[Joseph Gould (politician, born 1911)|Joseph Gould]], died in office sparking the final election held in the constituency.

Both his social and fiscal beliefs are seen as [[Democratic Party (United States)#Ideology|left-leaning]]. However, he has expressed his desire and intent to work with Republicans across the aisle on all issues. Many of his newly-appointed cabinet members are registered Republicans.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Schreiner |first1=Bruce |title=Democrat Beshear looking for ways to bridge partisan divide |url=https://www.lex18.com/media/v/content/6ac8f6bb22f140d5ad7680cf6f7b6e6b |agency=LEX18 |date=November 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Criminal justice===\nAs [[Kentucky Attorney General]], Beshear fought companies responsible for Kentucky's [[opioid crisis]] and got US$9.5 million in settlements for 16 treatment centers across the state. Beshear signed an executive order as governor to completely restore the voting rights of those convicted of non-violent [[felonies]], as the law preventing them to vote is widely seen as an unfair tactic to suppress the African American vote, as 4 percent of African American adults in Kentucky are convicted non-violent felons. The executive order restored voting rights to over 100,000 people in Kentucky.<ref name=felons />\n\n===Economic policy===\nBeshear states that he wants to bring more advanced manufacturing jobs to Kentucky to offset job losses due to the decline of coal. In addition, Beshear wants to increase the number of health care jobs in the state. Beshear opposes the  [[right-to-work law]] signed by his predecessor, [[Matt Bevin]].<ref name=swearin>{{cite web|title=Andy Beshear Swearing In|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtgPjZdZ2OU|publisher=WLKY News Louisville|access-date=December 10, 2019|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n===Education===\nBeshear supports a major pay raise for all teachers in Kentucky, who earn one of the lowest salaries of any teachers in the country.<ref name=swearin />\n\n===Environment===\nBeshear accepts the [[scientific consensus on climate change|scientific consensus]] that global warming and climate change are real and caused by humans.

When he was attorney general, 60% of his staff were minorities and women.<ref name=issues />\n\n===Health care===\nBeshear supports Kentucky's medicaid expansion, which provides affordable health care to over 500,000 Kentuckians, including all people with pre-existing conditions. Beshear criticized his predecessor, [[Matt Bevin]], for trying to roll back the state's medicaid expansion (which ultimately failed). As Attorney General and Governor, Beshear repeatedly expressed support for the [[Affordable Care Act]] (known as Obamacare), and criticized a Texas judge for ruling it as unconstitutional.<ref name=issues />\n\n===Infrastructure===\nBeshear supports the project to replace the structurally deficient [[Brent Spence Bridge]], which carries Interstates [[Interstate 71 in Kentucky|71]] and [[Interstate 75 in Kentucky|75]] over the [[Ohio River]] between [[Covington, KY]] and [[Cincinnati, OH]]. The project has long been delayed, and the bridge is considered to be the most critical transportation link in the state of Kentucky. Beshear has expressed willingness to work with [[Ohio]] governor [[Mike DeWine]], a Republican, to start the project. Beshear hopes to fund the bridge through conventional means and not tolling, however, he is unsure if the state has the funds to do that.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kentucky governor candidates face off in final debate|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX-ouG5QL7o&t=1287s|publisher=WLKY News Louisville|accessdate=December 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\nBeshear has also expressed support for the construction of the [[Interstate 69 Ohio River Bridge]] between [[Henderson, Kentucky]] and [[Evansville, Indiana]].

Beshear opposes pension cuts made by his predecessor, [[Matt Bevin]], and wants to guarantee all workers pensions for when they retire.<ref name=issues />\n\n== Personal life ==\nBeshear and his wife
