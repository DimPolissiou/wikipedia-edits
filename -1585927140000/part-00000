Since the early 2000s, advocates of video games have emphasized their use as an [[games as art|expressive medium]], arguing for their protection under the laws governing [[freedom of speech]] and also [[Video games in education|as an educational tool]]. Detractors argue that video games are [[harm principle|harmful]] and therefore should be [[Free speech limitations|subject to legislative oversight and restrictions]]. The positive and negative characteristics and effects of video games are the subject of scientific study. Academic research has examined the links between video games and [[video game addiction|addiction]], [[aggression]], [[violence]], [[psychosocial development|social development]], and a variety of stereotyping and [[sexual morality]] issues.<ref>Freedman J. \"Media violence and its effect on aggression: assessing the scientific evidence.\" [[University of Toronto Press]], Toronto 2002 {{ISBN|0-8020-8425-7}}.</ref>\n\n==Areas of controvers==\n===Violence===\n{{main|Violence and video games}}\nVideo games since their inception have been the subject of concern due to the depictions of violence they may contain, which have heightened as the technology behind video games improve the amount of visual detail and realism of games.

Controversy over sexual themes has occurred in the US. For instance, in June 2005, an entire portion of unused code was found within the main script of ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'', allowing the player to simulate sexual intercourse with the main character's girlfriends. This mode, entitled ''Hot Coffee'', could be accessed in the PC version via [[Mod (computer gaming)|mod]], and through [[Datel Action Replay|Action Replay]] codes in the [[PlayStation 2|PS2]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] versions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/2005/07/15/news_6129301.html|title=Confirmed: Sex minigame in PS2 San Andreas|publisher=Gamespot.com|accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref> The scene was left on the disc and could be accessed by altering a few bytes of the game's code via a [[hex editor]]. This feature prompted the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]] (ESRB) to change the rating of San Andreas on 20 July 2005 to \"adults only\". Furthermore, the game was withdrawn from sale in many stores. [[Rockstar Games]] posted a loss of $28.8 million in that [[financial quarter]]. This event was dubbed the [[Hot Coffee mod|'' Hot Coffee'' mod]] controversy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/old/content/2005/09/5285.ars |last=Fisher|first=Ken|title=Hot coffee burns Take-Two and Rockstar.|website=Ars Technica|date=September 7, 2005|accessdate=March 30, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe game ''[[RapeLay]]'', a Japanese [[eroge]] with a storyline centering on the player's character stalking and raping a mother and her two daughters, also caused controversy. Campaigns against the sale of the game resulted in its being banned in many countries. ''RapeLay''{{'s}} publisher, which intended the game only to be available in Japan, withdrew it from distribution.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Most Controversial Video Games|last=Meli|first=Marissa|url=http://www.ugo.com/games/most-controversial-video-games-rapelay|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111217230706/http://www.ugo.com/games/most-controversial-video-games-rapelay|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 17, 2011|website=UGO Networks|accessdate=January 26, 2012|date=December 17, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nSince 2018, Sony has now issued new regulations for [[PlayStation 4]] games with sexual content and [[fan service]].

Larger expansion packs led way to the nature of [[microtransaction]]s, small purchases, typically under {{USD|5}} for a small benefit in the game. One of the first examples of this was a piece of horse armor for ''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]'', which proved controversial. Publishers and developers would continue to develop other monetization methods, such as [[freemium]] games that are free to play but the player benefits by spending real-life money for in-game boosts. A more recent approach is the idea of [[loot box]]es, popularized in games like ''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]'', where the player can purchase with either in-game or real-life funds a virtual box that contains a set of in-game items, with the items being distributed by various rarity levels. Loot boxes came under intense government and media scrutiny in 2018 as it felt these mechanics were too close or were like gambling, and would violate their local laws. Some countries like Denmark and the Netherlands banned the use of loot boxes, while other countries like the United States and United Kingdom urged the video game industry to voluntarily regulate the use of loot boxes.\n\n===Environmental concerns===\nThe video game industry does contribute towards environmental concerns with how large it has grown in the 2010s.

The distinction is important because ''Marble Madness'' requires spatial skills while ''Conjecture'' does not.  The results may not be generalizable, since the sample of kids is taken from a single private school, and may not necessarily be representative of the population.  The children practiced their respective game for forty-five minutes per session for three sessions, all on separate days.  Appropriate pre- and post-tests were also assessed for spatial ability, on the day before and after the sessions. Irrespective of gender, practicing ''Marble Madness'' significantly increased spatial ability, especially in the children who had low performance on the spatial ability pre-test.  Conversely, playing ''Conjecture'' did not increase children's spatial skills.  This indicates that the type of game is important to consider when changes to cognitive abilities appear to be present.  It is unknown if these increases in spatial ability persist into the long-term.  This could mean that any benefits to practicing may only last if practice sessions are done at least intermittently.\n\n===Relief from stress===\nOlsen suggests video games can have social benefits for children, for example, video games can provide a topic of discussion and something over which children can bond, and can help children make friends; playing video games can increase a child's self-esteem when they are struggling in one aspect of their life, but are able to do something correctly in a video game; and, children can also learn to take on leadership roles within a multi-player online game.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Olsen C. |url=http://dmlcentral.net/sites/dmlcentral/files/resource_files/Olson_Motivations_for_Play_final.pdf|title=Children's motivation for video game play in the context of normal development|journal= Review of General Psychology|year=2010|volume=14|issue=2|pages=180\u2013187|accessdate=28 October 2013|doi=10.1037/a0018984|citeseerx=10.1.1.607.8230}}</ref> Christopher Ferguson, a psychologist well known for his video game research, conducted a study in which results suggest that violent games reduce depression and hostile feelings in players through mood management.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ferguson, C.|date=June 17, 2010|publisher=Texas A&M International University |accessdate=November 13, 2015|url=http://www.tamiu.edu/newsinfo/7-08-10/article5.shtml|title=Violent Video Games Help Relieve Stress, Depression, Says TAMIU Professor}}</ref>\n\nAccording to a research paper done by Radboud University, creating positive emotions help to build motivation, relationships, and cope with failure. It also helps to monitor negative emotions such as anger, frustration or anxiety and control these emotions in order to achieve a goal (Isabela Granic, Adam Lobel, and Rutger C.M.E. Engels). By learning to motivate themselves, students could push themselves to achieve goals and improve their performance academically as they would improve their performance similarly in their video games. Also, social games that rely on interactions with other people would promote healthy relationships and better communication between their fellow students, teachers and others outside of school. This could also benefit the students to work harder in class to achieve better grades and learn from their mistakes and improve rather than become frustrated.  As video games are a favored pastime among many students, having a game that promotes positive emotions will help to alleviate stress in the classroom, making the environment fun and sociable.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Granic|first1=Isabela|last2=Lobel|first2=Adam|last3=Engels|first3=Rutger|title=The Benefit of Playing Video Games|url=https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/amp-a0034857.pdf|website=American Psychologist|publisher=American Psychological Association|accessdate=20 November 2016|date=January 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Physical rehabilitation===\nStudies have also tried using video games to assist in physical rehabilitation.

Sherry, assistant professor at Michigan State University, 'educators are increasingly using educational games in the classroom as a motivational tool. The right video games help children master everything from basic grammar to complex math without the drudgery of old-school flash cards.'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://everydaylife.globalpost.com/positive-effects-video-games-children-16317.html |title=Positive Effects of Video Games on Children &#124; Everyday Life - Global Post |publisher=Everydaylife.globalpost.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-18}}</ref>\n\nCertain studies indicate that video games may have value in terms of academic performance, perhaps because of the skills that are developed in the process. \"When you play ... games you're solving puzzles to move to the next level and that involves using some of the general knowledge and skills in maths, reading and science that you've been taught during the day,\" said Alberto Posso, an Associate Professor at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, after analysing data from the results of standardized testing completed by over 12,000 high school students across Australia. As summarized by ''[[The Guardian]]'',<ref>{{cite news |last=Gibbs |first=Samuel |date=August 8, 2016 |title=Positive link between video games and academic performance, study suggests  |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/08/positive-link-between-video-games-and-academic-performance-study-suggests |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London, UK |access-date=August 9, 2016}}</ref> the study [published in the ''[[International Journal of Communication]]''], \"found that students who played online games almost every day scored 15 points above average in maths and reading tests and 17 points above average in science\". However, the reporter also stated that \"[the] methodology cannot prove that playing video games were the cause of the improvement\". ''The Guardian'' also reported that a Columbia University study indicated that extensive video gaming by students in the 6 to 11 age group provided a greatly increased chance of high intellectual functioning and overall school competence.\n\nIn a study done in 2017 by the International Conference Educational Technologies they explored the educational purposes of the video game Minecraft.

Herz argued that many so-called negative effects of video games, such as aggression and lack of pro-social behavior, are both necessary and useful traits to have in a [[capitalistic]] society. Specifically, Herz argued that many academic researchers have an anti-capitalist bias, and thus failed to notice the benefits of such traits.<ref>Wade J. and Beck M. \"Got game : how the gamer generation is reshaping business forever.\" Harvard Business School Press, Boston, Ma. 2006. {{ISBN|1578519497}} [Nachdr.]</ref><ref>Herz J. \"Joystick nation: how video games ate our quarters, won our hearts and rewired our minds.\" Little, Brown and Company, NY 1997.</ref>\n\n===Pro-social behaviour===\nIn 2010, Tobias Greitemeyer and Silvia Osswald conducted a series of 4 experiments where some people played a prosocially themed video game, and others played a neutral video game. They found that the people who played the prosocial game were more helpful compared to the people who played the neutral game when another person had a mishap and asked for help. The people who played prosocial games were also more likely to assist in further experiments as a favor to the researcher, and more likely to step in and calm down a situation where someone was being harassed.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Greitemeyer|first=Tobias|last2=Osswald|first2=Silvia|date=2010|title=Effects of prosocial video games on prosocial behavior.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=en|volume=98|issue=2|pages=211\u2013221|doi=10.1037/a0016997|pmid=20085396|issn=1939-1315|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/61fae380cba2bedd9d3815f0d6bc3f11b96b06c5}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, a study approved by Iowa State University assessed whether prosocial games could promote helpful behavior in children.

Afterwards, they completed a puzzle task with a partner and then assigned tangrams to a fictitious person in another room.  The participants were told that the person in the other room, who they did not know was not actually real, had an opportunity to win a prize.  The children were told they were not eligible for the gift card.  The measure for helpful or hurtful behavior was based on how many easy or difficult tangrams they assigned to the fictitious person.  Results indicated that playing prosocial games significantly more helpful behaviors in children than those who played violent video games.  Conversely, playing violent video games had significantly more hurtful behaviors in children than the children who played prosocial games.  Deviations from the expected pattern were also non-significant.  The short-term effects observed after only thirty minutes of playing are substantial enough to consider the possibility that the longer amount of time a child plays a video game, the more effect it will have on their behavior.  The researchers concluded that playing prosocial games affects a child's social cognition, because it changes their attitudes and affect.   It is also important to note that outside the confines of a study, playing a video game may affect how a child acts, but it is not the only factor present that can affect this.\n\nA study conducted in June 2014 at the [[University of Buffalo]] concluded that violent behavior in a virtual environment could lead to players' increased sensitivity of the moral codes that they violated, due to immoral behavior in video games eliciting guilt in players.<ref>{{Cite journal|volume=17|issue=8|pages=499\u2013504|doi=10.1089/cyber.2013.0658|pmid = 24950172|year=2014|last1=Grizzard|first1=Matthew|title=Being Bad in a Video Game Can Make Us Morally Sensitive|journal=Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking|last2=Tamborini|first2=Ron|last3=Lewis|first3=Robert J.|last4=Wang|first4=Lu|last5=Prabhu|first5=Sujay|hdl=2152/41144}}</ref>\n\n===Mental health disorders===\nStudies have shown that video games, whether they are designed to be therapeutic or not, can be used to lower anxiety levels of those who suffer from chronic anxiety issues.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hsieh|first1=Ru-Lan|title=The Impact of Short Term Video Games on Performance among Children with Developmental Delays: A Randomized Controlled Trial|journal=PLOS ONE|date=2016|volume=11|issue=3|pages=e0149714|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0149714|pmid=26983099|pmc=4794225|bibcode=2016PLoSO..1149714H}}</ref> Furthermore, a study done on children with mental disorders showed specifically designed therapeutic games, that provide a \"lifelike alternate reality\", which can help treat problems such as schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, and ADHD.<ref>\u2022\tConcepcion, H., (2017).

Controversy over sexual themes has occurred in the US. For instance, in June 2005, an entire portion of unused code was found within the main script of ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'', allowing the player to simulate sexual intercourse with the main character's girlfriends. This mode, entitled ''Hot Coffee'', could be accessed in the PC version via [[Mod (computer gaming)|mod]], and through [[Datel Action Replay|Action Replay]] codes in the [[PlayStation 2|PS2]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] versions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/2005/07/15/news_6129301.html|title=Confirmed: Sex minigame in PS2 San Andreas|publisher=Gamespot.com|accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref> The scene was left on the disc and could be accessed by altering a few bytes of the game's code via a [[hex editor]]. This feature prompted the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]] (ESRB) to change the rating of San Andreas on 20 July 2005 to \"adults only\". Furthermore, the game was withdrawn from sale in many stores. [[Rockstar Games]] posted a loss of $28.8 million in that [[financial quarter]].

Larger expansion packs led way to the nature of [[microtransaction]]s, small purchases, typically under {{USD|5}} for a small benefit in the game. One of the first examples of this was a piece of horse armor for ''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]'', which proved controversial. Publishers and developers would continue to develop other monetization methods, such as [[freemium]] games that are free to play but the player benefits by spending real-life money for in-game boosts. A more recent approach is the idea of [[loot box]]es, popularized in games like ''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]'', where the player can purchase with either in-game or real-life funds a virtual box that contains a set of in-game items, with the items being distributed by various rarity levels. Loot boxes came under intense government and media scrutiny in 2018 as it felt these mechanics were too close or were like gambling, and would violate their local laws.

The distinction is important because ''Marble Madness'' requires spatial skills while ''Conjecture'' does not.  The results may not be generalizable, since the sample of kids is taken from a single private school, and may not necessarily be representative of the population.  The children practiced their respective game for forty-five minutes per session for three sessions, all on separate days.  Appropriate pre- and post-tests were also assessed for spatial ability, on the day before and after the sessions. Irrespective of gender, practicing ''Marble Madness'' significantly increased spatial ability, especially in the children who had low performance on the spatial ability pre-test.  Conversely, playing ''Conjecture'' did not increase children's spatial skills.  This indicates that the type of game is important to consider when changes to cognitive abilities appear to be present.  It is unknown if these increases in spatial ability persist into the long-term.  This could mean that any benefits to practicing may only last if practice sessions are done at least intermittently.\n\n===Relief from stress===\nOlsen suggests video games can have social benefits for children, for example, video games can provide a topic of discussion and something over which children can bond, and can help children make friends; playing video games can increase a child's self-esteem when they are struggling in one aspect of their life, but are able to do something correctly in a video game; and, children can also learn to take on leadership roles within a multi-player online game.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Olsen C. |url=http://dmlcentral.net/sites/dmlcentral/files/resource_files/Olson_Motivations_for_Play_final.pdf|title=Children's motivation for video game play in the context of normal development|journal= Review of General Psychology|year=2010|volume=14|issue=2|pages=180\u2013187|accessdate=28 October 2013|doi=10.1037/a0018984|citeseerx=10.1.1.607.8230}}</ref> Christopher Ferguson, a psychologist well known for his video game research, conducted a study in which results suggest that violent games reduce depression and hostile feelings in players through mood management.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ferguson, C.|date=June 17, 2010|publisher=Texas A&M International University |accessdate=November 13, 2015|url=http://www.tamiu.edu/newsinfo/7-08-10/article5.shtml|title=Violent Video Games Help Relieve Stress, Depression, Says TAMIU Professor}}</ref>\n\nAccording to a research paper done by Radboud University, creating positive emotions help to build motivation, relationships, and cope with failure. It also helps to monitor negative emotions such as anger, frustration or anxiety and control these emotions in order to achieve a goal (Isabela Granic, Adam Lobel, and Rutger C.M.E. Engels). By learning to motivate themselves, students could push themselves to achieve goals and improve their performance academically as they would improve their performance similarly in their video games. Also, social games that rely on interactions with other people would promote healthy relationships and better communication between their fellow students, teachers and others outside of school. This could also benefit the students to work harder in class to achieve better grades and learn from their mistakes and improve rather than become frustrated.  As video games are a favored pastime among many students, having a game that promotes positive emotions will help to alleviate stress in the classroom, making the environment fun and sociable.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Granic|first1=Isabela|last2=Lobel|first2=Adam|last3=Engels|first3=Rutger|title=The Benefit of Playing Video Games|url=https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/amp-a0034857.pdf|website=American Psychologist|publisher=American Psychological Association|accessdate=20 November 2016|date=January 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Physical rehabilitation===\nStudies have also tried using video games to assist in physical rehabilitation.  Researchers used video games to provide physical therapy, improved disease self-management, distraction from discomfort, and increased physical activity, among other things.

Sherry, assistant professor at Michigan State University, 'educators are increasingly using educational games in the classroom as a motivational tool. The right video games help children master everything from basic grammar to complex math without the drudgery of old-school flash cards.'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://everydaylife.globalpost.com/positive-effects-video-games-children-16317.html |title=Positive Effects of Video Games on Children &#124; Everyday Life - Global Post |publisher=Everydaylife.globalpost.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-18}}</ref>\n\nCertain studies indicate that video games may have value in terms of academic performance, perhaps because of the skills that are developed in the process. \"When you play ... games you're solving puzzles to move to the next level and that involves using some of the general knowledge and skills in maths, reading and science that you've been taught during the day,\" said Alberto Posso, an Associate Professor at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, after analysing data from the results of standardized testing completed by over 12,000 high school students across Australia. As summarized by ''[[The Guardian]]'',<ref>{{cite news |last=Gibbs |first=Samuel |date=August 8, 2016 |title=Positive link between video games and academic performance, study suggests  |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/08/positive-link-between-video-games-and-academic-performance-study-suggests |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London, UK |access-date=August 9, 2016}}</ref> the study [published in the ''[[International Journal of Communication]]''], \"found that students who played online games almost every day scored 15 points above average in maths and reading tests and 17 points above average in science\". However, the reporter also stated that \"[the] methodology cannot prove that playing video games were the cause of the improvement\". ''The Guardian'' also reported that a Columbia University study indicated that extensive video gaming by students in the 6 to 11 age group provided a greatly increased chance of high intellectual functioning and overall school competence.\n\nIn a study done in 2017 by the International Conference Educational Technologies they explored the educational purposes of the video game Minecraft. The results that they concluded from this experiment was that it increased collaboration between groups, increased problem solving skills, improved computer skills and more.<ref>https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED579314.pdf</ref>\n\nIn an interview with CNN, [[Edward Castronova]], a professor of Telecommunications at Indiana University Bloomington said he was not surprised by the outcome of the Australian study but also discussed the issue of causal connection. \"Though there is a link between gaming and higher math and science scores, it doesn't mean playing games caused the higher scores. It could just be that kids who are sharp are looking for a challenge, and they don't find it on social media, and maybe they do find it on board games and video games,\" he explained.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/08/health/video-games-teens/ |title=Teen gamers do better at math than social media stars, study says |last=Scutti |first=Susan |date=August 8, 2016 |website=CNN Health |access-date=August 9, 2016 |quote=Video games' bad reputation may be unfair.

Herz argued that many so-called negative effects of video games, such as aggression and lack of pro-social behavior, are both necessary and useful traits to have in a [[capitalistic]] society. Specifically, Herz argued that many academic researchers have an anti-capitalist bias, and thus failed to notice the benefits of such traits.<ref>Wade J. and Beck M. \"Got game : how the gamer generation is reshaping business forever.\" Harvard Business School Press, Boston, Ma. 2006. {{ISBN|1578519497}} [Nachdr.]</ref><ref>Herz J. \"Joystick nation: how video games ate our quarters, won our hearts and rewired our minds.\" Little, Brown and Company, NY 1997.</ref>\n\n===Pro-social behaviour===\nIn 2010, Tobias Greitemeyer and Silvia Osswald conducted a series of 4 experiments where some people played a prosocially themed video game, and others played a neutral video game. They found that the people who played the prosocial game were more helpful compared to the people who played the neutral game when another person had a mishap and asked for help. The people who played prosocial games were also more likely to assist in further experiments as a favor to the researcher, and more likely to step in and calm down a situation where someone was being harassed.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Greitemeyer|first=Tobias|last2=Osswald|first2=Silvia|date=2010|title=Effects of prosocial video games on prosocial behavior.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=en|volume=98|issue=2|pages=211\u2013221|doi=10.1037/a0016997|pmid=20085396|issn=1939-1315|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/61fae380cba2bedd9d3815f0d6bc3f11b96b06c5}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, a study approved by Iowa State University assessed whether prosocial games could promote helpful behavior in children.

Afterwards, they completed a puzzle task with a partner and then assigned tangrams to a fictitious person in another room.  The participants were told that the person in the other room, who they did not know was not actually real, had an opportunity to win a prize.  The children were told they were not eligible for the gift card.  The measure for helpful or hurtful behavior was based on how many easy or difficult tangrams they assigned to the fictitious person.  Results indicated that playing prosocial games significantly more helpful behaviors in children than those who played violent video games.  Conversely, playing violent video games had significantly more hurtful behaviors in children than the children who played prosocial games.  Deviations from the expected pattern were also non-significant.  The short-term effects observed after only thirty minutes of playing are substantial enough to consider the possibility that the longer amount of time a child plays a video game, the more effect it will have on their behavior.  The researchers concluded that playing prosocial games affects a child's social cognition, because it changes their attitudes and affect.   It is also important to note that outside the confines of a study, playing a video game may affect how a child acts, but it is not the only factor present that can affect this.\n\nA study conducted in June 2014 at the [[University of Buffalo]] concluded that violent behavior in a virtual environment could lead to players' increased sensitivity of the moral codes that they violated, due to immoral behavior in video games eliciting guilt in players.<ref>{{Cite journal|volume=17|issue=8|pages=499\u2013504|doi=10.1089/cyber.2013.0658|pmid = 24950172|year=2014|last1=Grizzard|first1=Matthew|title=Being Bad in a Video Game Can Make Us Morally Sensitive|journal=Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking|last2=Tamborini|first2=Ron|last3=Lewis|first3=Robert J.|last4=Wang|first4=Lu|last5=Prabhu|first5=Sujay|hdl=2152/41144}}</ref>\n\n===Mental health disorders===\nStudies have shown that video games, whether they are designed to be therapeutic or not, can be used to lower anxiety levels of those who suffer from chronic anxiety issues.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hsieh|first1=Ru-Lan|title=The Impact of Short Term Video Games on Performance among Children with Developmental Delays: A Randomized Controlled Trial|journal=PLOS ONE|date=2016|volume=11|issue=3|pages=e0149714|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0149714|pmid=26983099|pmc=4794225|bibcode=2016PLoSO..1149714H}}</ref> Furthermore, a study done on children with mental disorders showed specifically designed therapeutic games, that provide a \"lifelike alternate reality\", which can help treat problems such as schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, and ADHD.<ref>\u2022\tConcepcion, H., (2017).

Lady Franklin purchased the 177&nbsp;ton ''Fox'' in April 1857, after other efforts to secure a vessel failed.\n\n== Expedition ==\nWith an experienced crew of 25, the ''Fox'' set sail from [[Aberdeen]] on 1&nbsp;July 1857, after extensive refitting and external sheathing suitable for Arctic service. Inuit interpreter Carl Peterson, who had served under [[Elisha Kent Kane]], was included. They quickly stocked provisions, including lemon juice to prevent scurvy. The government provided additional equipment and arms.\n\nThey briefly put ashore to several ports on Greenland, sending home an ailing crewman and obtaining coal, dogs, provisions, and Inuit guides Anton Christian and Samuel Emanuel. They set out again in early August and soon encountered icebergs off [[Disco Bay]], reaching [[Melville Bay]] on 12&nbsp;August.\n\n=== First winter ===\nThe ice gradually closed in on the ''Fox'' in just a few days, the ship making small advancements with much effort. Some seal hunting provided sport and extended their sled dog's rations as they drifted with the [[pack ice|pack]] through August. By mid-September, they were slowly drifting west among the approaching [[iceberg]]s, still hoping for liberation to [[Upernavik]], but on 18&nbsp;September, they began to prepare the ship for winter. Wildlife, including birds, seals, [[narwhal]] and [[polar bears]] provided hunting as the crew settled into the winter monotony. The ship's surgeon, Dr. Walker, conducted schooling for the crew, and a successful November bear hunt produced a skin that was to be presented to Lady Franklin. The seasonal darkness settled in.\n\nDecember began with the death of a crewman, stoker Robert Scott, who succumbed to injuries following a fall down a hatchway. His remains were committed to the deep on 4&nbsp;December. Temperatures averaged below {{convert|-20|F}} while the crew practiced the construction of snow huts. The returning daylight improved morale as February 1858 progressed and the icebergs began to spread out. By mid-March, open lanes of water had begun to appear, but despite several efforts to free the ship, the ''Fox'' was held by the ice until 26&nbsp;April. They had been held by the ice for 242&nbsp;days.<ref name=McClintock1/>\n\n=== Arctic summer ===\nTwo days later, they were safely anchored at Holsteinborg, Greenland, where their health, spirits and provisions were restored until their departure on 10&nbsp;May. They remained in the area of Upernavik, attempts at advancement forestalled by the remaining pack ice. By July, their progress improved as open leads in the ice presented themselves. Supplies were supplemented by regular hunting of [[polar bear]], [[Pinniped|seal]], [[reindeer]] and various birds. Meetings and barter with Inuit, emboldened by previous contact with European explorers, occurred throughout the summer. However, no information regarding Franklin was obtained, although they had some recollection of other explorers, including [[John Rae (explorer)|John Rae]].\n\nBy August, the ''Fox'' was steaming towards [[Beechey Island]], known to have been Franklin's first winter encampment in 1845\u20131846. They arrived on 11&nbsp;August, the once desolate site now including a depot house and several small boats. Letters left previously at the site were taken aboard. On Beechey, McClintock placed a stone monument to Franklin and his crew, provided by Lady Franklin and constructed by [[Henry Grinnell]], before departing on 16&nbsp;August.\n\nThrough [[Barrow Strait]], the ''Fox'' passed the same waters that held the ''Enterprise'' and ''Investigator'' nine years earlier during the [[McClure Arctic Expedition]]. [[Bellot Strait]] was explored as the ship probed the westward ice, already anticipating the onset of winter. Caches of provisions were made on shore in anticipation of separate explorations in the coming spring. By 28&nbsp;September, they had pushed to their wintering place off of Point Kennedy. The ship was prepared for winter once again, and a magnetic observatory was built.\n\n=== Second winter ===\nBy November, the crew had again settled into winter habits, occasionally hunting and brewing sugar beer. Dogsled exploration and depot parties braved drifting ice and temperatures of {{convert|-15|F}}. On 7&nbsp;November, the ship's engineer George Brands died suddenly, presumably from [[apoplexy]], and was buried on shore. Temperatures reached {{convert|-47|F}} as animals became scarce and winds became fierce. No regular schooling was conducted, although several crewmembers busied themselves by studying navigation. The new year was welcomed amid improvised celebrations below deck. By February, animals began to return with the increasing sunlight. One member of the crew came down with [[scurvy]], as he had avoided the preserved meats.\n\n== Discoveries ==\n\n=== Traces of Franklin ===\n[[File:Durand-brager-456.png|thumb|Discovery of the remains]]\nThe sled dogs were separated into three teams as land parties\u2014McClure, Young, and Walker\u2014departed to extend the search on 17&nbsp;February, with temperatures no less severe. McClintock's dogs experienced much difficulty with the journey, and the planned trip was shortened. Nights were passed in snow huts. On 2&nbsp;March, they were surprised to encounter four Inuit returning from a seal hunt. One of them wore a naval button that came, he said, from a group of Europeans who had starved near a river&nbsp;\u2013 Franklin's last survivors, as confirmed by John Rae in 1854. Another had met with Rae's expedition in the same area.\n\nThe next day, the entire 45&nbsp;members of this group of Inuit arrived. McClintock purchased all of the Franklin relics they possessed, mostly silverware and buttons. While none of the natives had seen Franklin's crew alive, several had seen their remains. Some told of a group of survivors from a three-masted ship crushed by the ice west of [[King William Island]], placing them in the same area as described by Rae. McClure's party returned to the ''Fox'' with this evidence on 14&nbsp;March, having travelled some {{convert|360|mi}} and charting {{convert|120|mi}} of new coast. Young's party had already returned to the ship without major discoveries. Walker's team, sent to retrieve cached provisions, returned without success on 25&nbsp;March.\n\nOn April 2, McClintock finally set out for King William Island to followup on the Inuit reports, with a plan to divide his company into two teams to more quickly explore the island&nbsp;\u2013 Lieutenant Hobson would lead one party to explore the north coast of King William Island, and McClintock himself would lead one along the southern shore. On April&nbsp;20, McClintock encountered another group of Inuit. In addition to providing extensive relics, they described two ships near King William's Island. One of the ships had sunk in deep water, while the other was broken upon the ice with one body aboard. They described the European survivors making for the \"large river\" with boats in the fall of that year, many falling on the way. The following winter, their bones had been found. Following their directions, a skeleton was located on the route on 24&nbsp;May, confirmed as a crewman by the remaining garments. He appeared to have died where he fell on the journey. <ref name=McClintock1/>\n\n=== Final communications ===\n[[File:Franklinexpeditionnote.jpg|thumb|The final Franklin communication]]\n[[File:Durand-brager-453.png|thumb|Discovery of the cairn]]\nMeanwhile, near Cape Jane Franklin, the sledge party led by Lieutenant Hobson located the first written communication recovered from Franklin's Expedition<ref name=McClintock1/> inside a message cairn (note that the date of wintering at Beechey has been attributed to error):\n\n{{Quote|\n::::H. M. ships 'Erebus' and 'Terror' wintered in the ice in\n28 of May, 1847 lat. 70\u00b0 05' N. long. 98\u00b0 23' W.\n\nHaving wintered in 1846\u20137 at Beechey Island in lat. 74\u00b0 43' 28\" N.;\nlong. 91\u00b0 39' 15\" W., after having ascended Wellington Channel to lat.\n77\u00b0 and returned by the west side of Cornwallis Island.\n\nSir John Franklin commanding the expedition.\n\nAll well.\n\nParty consisting of 2 officers and 6 men left the ships on Monday,\n24 May 1847.\n\n:::Gm. Gore, Lieut.\n:::Chas. F. Des Voeus, Mate.}}\n\nHandwritten around the margin of this communication was the following:\n\n<blockquote>25th April 1848\n\nHMShips Terror and Erebus were deserted on the 22nd April 5 leagues NNW of this having been beset since 12th Sept 1846.\n\nThe officers and crews consisting of 105 souls under the command of Captain F. R. M. Crozier landed here \u2014 in Lat. 69\u00b037\u201942\u2019\u2019 Long. 98\u00b041\u2019\n\nThis paper was found by Lt. Irving under the cairn supposed to have been built by Sir James Ross in 1831 \u2014 4 miles to the Northward \u2014 where it had been deposited by the late Commander Gore in May June 1847.\n\nSir James Ross\u2019 pillar has not however been found and the paper has been transferred to this position which is that in which Sir J. Ross\u2019 pillar was erected.\n\nSir John Franklin died on the 11th of June 1847 and the total loss by deaths in the Expedition has been to this date 9 officers and 15 men.\n\n[signed] F. R. M. Crozier Captain & Senior Offr\n\nAnd start on tomorrow 26th for Backs Fish River\n\n[signed] James Fitzjames Captain HMS Erebus</blockquote>\n\nSigned by Captains Crozier and Fitzjames, it also states \"and start (on) to-morrow, 26th, for [[Back River (Nunavut)|Back's Fish River]],\" and documents the position of original placement at Sir James Ross's pillar. At this point, Franklin's crews were likely retreating for their lives. McClintock, a few days behind Hobson, continued searching the area for additional clues, which included the discovery of a large boat that had been prepared for river use, fastened to a large sledge. The boat contained the skeletal remains of two men and an extensive collection of objects that would have little value in an Arctic crossing. In exploring Back Bay into June, Hobson also found a cairn with a second note left by Lieutenant Gore in May 1847, its content similar to the first. More abandoned equipment surrounded the cairn, the most interesting of which were taken. These sites appear to have been untouched by the natives, and no part of a ship was seen.\n\nAmid melting ice, McClintock reached the ''Fox'' on 19&nbsp;June. Hobson had arrived five days earlier, unable to walk from his ordeal, but recovered on ship. Young had also returned earlier, similarly impaired by the harsh conditions, but had set out again. A few members of the crew had developed signs of scurvy, and Thomas Blackwell, the man who first contracted the disease, had perished of it before McClintock's return. Young returned again on 27&nbsp;June, having mapped [[Peel Sound]], but finding no traces of Franklin.\n\nPreparations for departure were made in July, and a cairn containing detailed records of their efforts was constructed. On 9&nbsp;August, the ice allowed them to begin steaming out, and despite the loss of their two engineers and dangerous ice, open seas were soon reached. The port of [[Godhavn]] on the west coast of [[Greenland]] was reached on 29&nbsp;July, where their Inuit guides were paid and discharged. The ''Fox'' made port in [[London]] on 21&nbsp;September 1859, having lost three members of her crew.\n\n== Legacy ==\nMcClintock and Hobson discovered the last written communications from the last survivors of the Franklin expedition, confirming elements of the history maintained by local Inuit as well as the date of Franklin's own death. McClintock provided the first survey of the west coast of King William's Land.<ref name=McClintock1/> In recognition of his services, he was knighted, and elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1865.<ref name=Nature1/> McClintock and members of his crew were awarded the Arctic Medal as well.\n\nMcClintock's observations of persistent pack ice in [[Victoria Strait]] confirmed the hopelessness of Franklin's attempts to push south through the unexplored passage.<ref name=Griffiths1>Griffiths, Franklyn (December&nbsp;31, 1987).

On Beechey, McClintock placed a stone monument to Franklin and his crew, provided by Lady Franklin and constructed by [[Henry Grinnell]], before departing on 16&nbsp;August.\n\nThrough [[Barrow Strait]], the ''Fox'' passed the same waters that held the ''Enterprise'' and ''Investigator'' nine years earlier during the [[McClure Arctic Expedition]]. [[Bellot Strait]] was explored as the ship probed the westward ice, already anticipating the onset of winter. Caches of provisions were made on shore in anticipation of separate explorations in the coming spring. By 28&nbsp;September, they had pushed to their wintering place off of Point Kennedy. The ship was prepared for winter once again, and a magnetic observatory was built.\n\n=== Second winter ===\nBy November, the crew had again settled into winter habits, occasionally hunting and brewing sugar beer. Dogsled exploration and depot parties braved drifting ice and temperatures of {{convert|-15|F}}. On 7&nbsp;November, the ship's engineer George Brands died suddenly, presumably from [[apoplexy]], and was buried on shore. Temperatures reached {{convert|-47|F}} as animals became scarce and winds became fierce. No regular schooling was conducted, although several crewmembers busied themselves by studying navigation. The new year was welcomed amid improvised celebrations below deck. By February, animals began to return with the increasing sunlight. One member of the crew came down with [[scurvy]], as he had avoided the preserved meats.\n\n== Discoveries ==\n\n=== Traces of Franklin ===\n[[File:Durand-brager-456.png|thumb|Discovery of the remains]]\nThe sled dogs were separated into three teams as land parties\u2014McClure, Young, and Walker\u2014departed to extend the search on 17&nbsp;February, with temperatures no less severe. McClintock's dogs experienced much difficulty with the journey, and the planned trip was shortened. Nights were passed in snow huts. On 2&nbsp;March, they were surprised to encounter four Inuit returning from a seal hunt. One of them wore a naval button that came, he said, from a group of Europeans who had starved near a river&nbsp;\u2013 Franklin's last survivors, as confirmed by John Rae in 1854. Another had met with Rae's expedition in the same area.\n\nThe next day, the entire 45&nbsp;members of this group of Inuit arrived. McClintock purchased all of the Franklin relics they possessed, mostly silverware and buttons. While none of the natives had seen Franklin's crew alive, several had seen their remains. Some told of a group of survivors from a three-masted ship crushed by the ice west of [[King William Island]], placing them in the same area as described by Rae. McClure's party returned to the ''Fox'' with this evidence on 14&nbsp;March, having travelled some {{convert|360|mi}} and charting {{convert|120|mi}} of new coast. Young's party had already returned to the ship without major discoveries. Walker's team, sent to retrieve cached provisions, returned without success on 25&nbsp;March.\n\nOn April 2, McClintock finally set out for King William Island to followup on the Inuit reports, with a plan to divide his company into two teams to more quickly explore the island&nbsp;\u2013 Lieutenant Hobson would lead one party to explore the north coast of King William Island, and McClintock himself would lead one along the southern shore. On April&nbsp;20, McClintock encountered another group of Inuit. In addition to providing extensive relics, they described two ships near King William's Island. One of the ships had sunk in deep water, while the other was broken upon the ice with one body aboard. They described the European survivors making for the \"large river\" with boats in the fall of that year, many falling on the way. The following winter, their bones had been found. Following their directions, a skeleton was located on the route on 24&nbsp;May, confirmed as a crewman by the remaining garments. He appeared to have died where he fell on the journey. <ref name=McClintock1/>\n\n=== Final communications ===\n[[File:Franklinexpeditionnote.jpg|thumb|The final Franklin communication]]\n[[File:Durand-brager-453.png|thumb|Discovery of the cairn]]\nMeanwhile, near Cape Jane Franklin, the sledge party led by Lieutenant Hobson located the first written communication recovered from Franklin's Expedition<ref name=McClintock1/> inside a message cairn (note that the date of wintering at Beechey has been attributed to error):\n\n{{Quote|\n::::H. M. ships 'Erebus' and 'Terror' wintered in the ice in\n28 of May, 1847 lat. 70\u00b0 05' N. long. 98\u00b0 23' W.\n\nHaving wintered in 1846\u20137 at Beechey Island in lat. 74\u00b0 43' 28\" N.;\nlong. 91\u00b0 39' 15\" W., after having ascended Wellington Channel to lat.\n77\u00b0 and returned by the west side of Cornwallis Island.\n\nSir John Franklin commanding the expedition.\n\nAll well.\n\nParty consisting of 2 officers and 6 men left the ships on Monday,\n24 May 1847.\n\n:::Gm. Gore, Lieut.\n:::Chas. F. Des Voeus, Mate.}}\n\nHandwritten around the margin of this communication was the following:\n\n<blockquote>25th April 1848\n\nHMShips Terror and Erebus were deserted on the 22nd April 5 leagues NNW of this having been beset since 12th Sept 1846.\n\nThe officers and crews consisting of 105 souls under the command of Captain F. R. M. Crozier landed here \u2014 in Lat. 69\u00b037\u201942\u2019\u2019 Long. 98\u00b041\u2019\n\nThis paper was found by Lt. Irving under the cairn supposed to have been built by Sir James Ross in 1831 \u2014 4 miles to the Northward \u2014 where it had been deposited by the late Commander Gore in May June 1847.\n\nSir James Ross\u2019 pillar has not however been found and the paper has been transferred to this position which is that in which Sir J. Ross\u2019 pillar was erected.\n\nSir John Franklin died on the 11th of June 1847 and the total loss by deaths in the Expedition has been to this date 9 officers and 15 men.\n\n[signed] F. R. M. Crozier Captain & Senior Offr\n\nAnd start on tomorrow 26th for Backs Fish River\n\n[signed] James Fitzjames Captain HMS Erebus</blockquote>\n\nSigned by Captains Crozier and Fitzjames, it also states \"and start (on) to-morrow, 26th, for [[Back River (Nunavut)|Back's Fish River]],\" and documents the position of original placement at Sir James Ross's pillar. At this point, Franklin's crews were likely retreating for their lives. McClintock, a few days behind Hobson, continued searching the area for additional clues, which included the discovery of a large boat that had been prepared for river use, fastened to a large sledge. The boat contained the skeletal remains of two men and an extensive collection of objects that would have little value in an Arctic crossing. In exploring Back Bay into June, Hobson also found a cairn with a second note left by Lieutenant Gore in May 1847, its content similar to the first. More abandoned equipment surrounded the cairn, the most interesting of which were taken. These sites appear to have been untouched by the natives, and no part of a ship was seen.\n\nAmid melting ice, McClintock reached the ''Fox'' on 19&nbsp;June. Hobson had arrived five days earlier, unable to walk from his ordeal, but recovered on ship. Young had also returned earlier, similarly impaired by the harsh conditions, but had set out again. A few members of the crew had developed signs of scurvy, and Thomas Blackwell, the man who first contracted the disease, had perished of it before McClintock's return. Young returned again on 27&nbsp;June, having mapped [[Peel Sound]], but finding no traces of Franklin.\n\nPreparations for departure were made in July, and a cairn containing detailed records of their efforts was constructed. On 9&nbsp;August, the ice allowed them to begin steaming out, and despite the loss of their two engineers and dangerous ice, open seas were soon reached. The port of [[Godhavn]] on the west coast of [[Greenland]] was reached on 29&nbsp;July, where their Inuit guides were paid and discharged. The ''Fox'' made port in [[London]] on 21&nbsp;September 1859, having lost three members of her crew.\n\n== Legacy ==\nMcClintock and Hobson discovered the last written communications from the last survivors of the Franklin expedition, confirming elements of the history maintained by local Inuit as well as the date of Franklin's own death. McClintock provided the first survey of the west coast of King William's Land.<ref name=McClintock1/> In recognition of his services, he was knighted, and elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1865.<ref name=Nature1/> McClintock and members of his crew were awarded the Arctic Medal as well.\n\nMcClintock's observations of persistent pack ice in [[Victoria Strait]] confirmed the hopelessness of Franklin's attempts to push south through the unexplored passage.<ref name=Griffiths1>Griffiths, Franklyn (December&nbsp;31, 1987).

It was directed and co-written by [[Andrew Stanton]], produced by [[Jim Morris (film producer)|Jim Morris]], and co-written by [[Jim Reardon]]. It stars the voices of [[Ben Burtt]], [[Elissa Knight]], [[Jeff Garlin]], [[Fred Willard]], [[John Ratzenberger]], [[Kathy Najimy]] and [[Sigourney Weaver]], and was [[List of Pixar films|the overall ninth feature film produced by the company]]. It follows a solitary [[trash compactor]] robot on a future, [[Planetary habitability|uninhabitable]], deserted Earth, left to clean up garbage. However, he is visited by a probe sent by the starship ''Axiom'', a robot called EVE, with whom he falls in love and pursues across the galaxy.\n\nAfter directing ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', Stanton felt Pixar had created believable simulations of underwater physics and was willing to direct a film set largely in space. ''WALL-E'' has minimal dialogue in its early sequences; many of the characters do not have voices, but instead communicate with [[body language]] and robotic sounds designed by Burtt. The film criticizes [[consumerism]], [[corporatism]], [[nostalgia]], [[waste management]], [[human impact on the environment|human environmental impact and concerns]], [[obesity]], and [[global catastrophic risk]].<ref name=\"Murray and Heumann, 2009\">{{cite journal|last=Murray|first=Robin L.|author2=Heumann, Joseph K. |title=WALL-E: From Environmental Adaptation to Sentimental Nostalgia|journal=Jump Cut: A Review of Contemporary Media|date=Spring 2009|series=No. 51|url=http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/jc51.2009/WallE/text.html|accessdate=November 16, 2012}}</ref> It is also Pixar's first animated film with segments featuring live-action characters.

Humanity is nowhere to be found, having been evacuated by the [[megacorporation]] Buy-N-Large (BnL) on giant [[Generation ship|starliners]] seven centuries earlier. Of all the robotic [[trash compactor]]s left by BnL to clean up, only one remains operational: a ''Waste Allocation Load-Lifter'' (Earth Class), or WALL-E. One day, WALL-E's routine is broken by the arrival of an unmanned probe carrying an ''Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator'' or EVE, sent to scan the planet for plant life. WALL-E is smitten by the sleek, otherworldly robot, but she goes into [[standby mode|standby]] when he shows her his most recent find: a living seedling. The probe returns to collect EVE and the plant, and with WALL-E clinging on, returns to its mothership, the starliner ''Axiom''.\n\nIn the centuries since the ''Axiom'' left Earth, its passengers have degenerated into helpless corpulence due to laziness and microgravity, their every whim catered to by machines. Captain McCrea, used to sitting back while his robotic lieutenant AUTO flies the ship, is taken aback by a positive probe response and learns that placing the plant in the ship's Holo-Detector will trigger a [[warp drive|hyperjump]] back to Earth so humanity can begin recolonization. The plant proves to be missing from EVE's storage compartment though, and she angrily blames WALL-E for its disappearance.\n\nWith the plant missing, EVE is deemed faulty and taken to Diagnostics. WALL-E proceeds to \"free\" her along with the other faulty robots, causing them to be designated rogue. Frustrated, EVE tries to send WALL-E home on an [[escape pod]], but they are suddenly shocked when they see AUTO's first mate GO-4 stowing the stolen plant in a pod set to self-destruct. WALL-E manages to save the plant from being lost for good, seconds before the pod explodes, and he and EVE reconcile, celebrating with a dance in space around the ''Axiom''.\n\nThey bring the plant back to McCrea, who watches EVE's recordings of Earth and finally concludes that they must go back. However, AUTO reveals he was given a final obsolete no-return directive [[A113]], issued after BnL inaccurately concluded centuries ago that the planet could not be saved. AUTO and GO-4 stage a [[mutiny]], by electrocuting WALL-E and shutting EVE down, and throwing them both down the garbage chute. Enraged at AUTO's treachery, McCrea struggles with him while EVE, who has been reactivated by a mouse robot, helps WALL-E bring the plant to the ship's Holo-Detector. AUTO furiously attemps to close the Holo-Detector, but WALL-E ithough at the cost of getting crashed afterwards. McCrea shuts down AUTO, and EVE inserts the plant, initiating a hyperjump.\n\nArriving back on Earth, EVE replaces WALL-E's circuit, but finds that his memory has been reset and his personality is gone. Heartbroken, EVE gives WALL-E a farewell kiss, which sparks his memory and restores his original personality. WALL-E and EVE reunite as the humans and robots of the ''Axiom'' take their first steps on Earth. During the credits, humans and robots are shown learning to farm, fish, and build, turning the ravaged planet into a paradise, and the plant is shown to have grown into a mighty tree.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ben Burtt]] as WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter: Earth-Class),<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,1813964,00.html|title=WALL-E: Pixar's Biggest Gamble|last=Corliss|first=Richard|date=June 12, 2008|work=Time|access-date=September 23, 2017|issn=0040-781X}}</ref> the [[title character]]. WALL-E, a robot who has achieved sentience, and is the only robot of his kind shown to be still functioning on Earth. He is a small mobile compactor box with all-terrain treads, three-fingered shovel hands, binocular eyes, and retractable solar cells for power. Although working diligently to fulfill his directive to clean up the garbage (all the while accompanied by his cockroach friend named Hal and music playing from his on-board recorder), he is distracted by his curiosity, collecting trinkets of interest from amongst the garbage. He stores and displays these \"treasures\" such as a [[birdcage]] full of [[rubber duck]]s, a [[Rubik's Cube]], [[Zippo]]s, disposable cups filled with plastic cutlery and a golden [[trophy]] at his home where he examines and categorizes his finds. He ignores items valued by humans, throwing away a [[diamond]] ring but keeping the ring box. He neatly organizes his finds at the home he has created, where he watches a [[video cassette]] of ''[[Hello, Dolly! (film)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' via an [[iPod]] viewed through a large [[Fresnel lens]], mimicking the dance sequences.\n** Burtt is also credited for the voice of M-O (Microbe-Obliterator), a tiny, obsessively clean maintenance cleanerbot with a brush in his arms who attempts to keep the ''Axiom'' clean.\n* [[Elissa Knight]] as EVE (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator; which WALL-E pronounces [[Eva (name)|Eva]]),<ref name=\":0\"/> a sleek robot probe whose directive is to locate vegetation on Earth and verify habitability. She has a glossy white egg-shaped body and blue [[LED]] eyes. She moves using [[antigravity]] technology and is equipped with scanners, specimen storage and a \"[[Plasma weapon (fiction)|quasar ion cannon]]\" in her arm, which she is quick to use.\n* [[Jeff Garlin]] as Captain B. McCrea, the commanding officer of the ''Axiom''. He is merely a [[figurehead]], with the ship's autopilot handling all true command functions. He is credited simply as \"Captain\" and his name is only seen on a wall depicting portraits of all the ship's captains.\n* [[Fred Willard]] as Shelby Forthright, the CEO of the Buy-N-Large Corporation and the only major live-action character, shown only in videos recorded around the time of the ''Axiom''{{'}}s initial launch in the early 22nd century. Constantly optimistic, Forthright proposed the plan to evacuate Earth's population to space, then clean up the planet so they could return within five years. However, upon discovering that Earth had become too toxic to support life, the BNL corporation soon abandoned the cleanup and recolonization, issued to all the autopilots of any ''Axiom''{{'}}s the directive to forbid anyone return to Earth and subsequently dissolved. Forthright is the first (and so far the only) live-action character with a speaking role in any Pixar film.\n* [[John Ratzenberger]] and [[Kathy Najimy]] as John and Mary, respectively. John and Mary both live on the ''Axiom'' and are so dependent on their personal video screens and automatic services that they are oblivious to their surroundings, for instance not noticing that the ship features a giant swimming pool. However, they are brought out of their trances after separate encounters with WALL-E, eventually meeting face-to-face for the first time.\n* [[Sigourney Weaver]] as the voice of the ''Axiom''{{'}}s computer. Stanton joked about the role with Weaver, saying, \"You realize you get to be 'Mother' now?\"<ref name=notes/><ref name=\"dvd-mother\">DVD. Scene 16. \"Captain on Deck\".

At first, AUTO seems to be a benevolent robot, only to be later revealed as a rogue dishonest semi-[[extremist]], which unlike other robots, he was never influenced by WALL-E, but by an outdated directive [[A113]], which is to forbid the ''Axiom'' and the humans from returning to Earth, due of the unsolved problems regarding toxicity. Though AUTO's directive was eventually tharwed in the film's climax, it is unknown what happened to other autopilots which also followed that directive and the other cruise ships that carried the humans.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Writing===\n{{quote box|<poem>\nBACK ON M-O AND WALLY{{sic}}\n\nM-O just finishes cleaning the floor.\nWally is fascinated.\nImpishly makes another mark.\nM-O compulsively cleans it.

Stanton removed this to keep some mystery as to why the plant is taken from EVE. The captain appears to be unintelligent, but Stanton wanted him to just be unchallenged; otherwise he would have not been sympathetic.<ref name=deleted/> One example of how unintelligent the captain was depicted initially is that he was seen to wear his hat upside-down, only to fix it before he challenges Auto. In the finished film, he merely wears it casually atop his head, tightening it when he really takes command of the ''Axiom''.<ref name=evolution/>\n\nOriginally, EVE would have been electrocuted by Auto, and then be quickly saved from ejection at the hands of the WALL-A robots by WALL-E (this scene was eventually used in the [[WALL-E (video game)|videogame version of the film]]). He would have then revived her by replacing her power unit with a cigarette lighter he brought from Earth. Stanton reversed this following a 2007 test screening, as he wanted to show EVE replacing her directive of bringing the plant to the captain with repairing WALL-E, and it made WALL-E even more heroic if he held the holo-detector open despite being badly hurt. Stanton also moved the moment where WALL-E reveals his plant (which he had snatched from the self-destructing escape pod) from producing it from a closet to immediately after his escape, as it made EVE happier and gave them stronger motivation to dance around the ship.<ref name=deleted/> Stanton felt half the audience at the screening believed the humans would be unable to cope with living on Earth and would have died out after the film's end.

The dull tans of Earth subtly become soft pinks and blues when EVE arrives. When WALL-E shows EVE all his collected items, all the lights he has collected light up to give an inviting atmosphere, like a [[Christmas tree]].

Eggleston divided the inside of the ship into three sections; the rear's economy class has a basic gray concrete texture with graphics keeping to the red, blue, and white of the BnL logo. The coach class with living/shopping spaces has \"S\" shapes as people are always looking for \"what's around the corner\". Stanton intended to have many colorful signs, but he realized this would overwhelm the audience and went with Eggleston's original idea of a small number of larger signs.

Katherine Ellison asserts that \"Americans produce nearly 400 million tons of [[solid waste]] per year but recycle less than a third of it, according to a recent Columbia University study.\" [[Landfill]]s were filling up so quickly that predictions were made that the UK could run out of landfill space by the year 2017.<ref name=\"Ellison, 2008\">{{cite journal|last=Ellison|first=Katherine|title=Talking Trash|journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment|date=October 2008|volume=6, No. 8|jstor=20440969|pages=456}}</ref>\n\n===Environment, waste and nostalgia===\n{{further|Pollution}}\nIn the DVD commentary, Stanton said that he has been asked if it was his intention to make a movie about consumerism. His answer was it was not; it was a way to answer the question of how would the Earth get to the state where one robot would be left to continue the cleanup by itself. Nevertheless, some critics have noted an incongruity between the perceived pro-environmental and anti-consumerist messaging of the film, and the environmental impacts in the production and merchandising of the film.<ref>[https://governmentcheese.ca/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=14:test&catid=11&Itemid=111 Wall-E (2008) and the Ecological Footprint of Animation Production]</ref>\n\nIn \"WALL-E: from environmental adaption to sentimental [[nostalgia]],\" Robin Murray and Joseph Heumann explain the important theme of nostalgia in this film. Nostalgia is clearly represented by human artifacts, left behind, that WALL-E collects and cherishes, for example [[Zippo]] lighters, hubcaps, and plastic sporks. These modern items that we use out of necessity, are made sentimental through the lens of the bleak future of Earth. Nostalgia is also expressed through the musical score, as the film opens with a camera shot of outer space that slowly zooms into a waste filled Earth while playing \"Put on Your Sunday Clothes\", reflecting on simpler and happier times in human history. This film also expresses nostalgia through the longing of nature and the natural world, as it is the sight and feeling of soil, and the plant brought back to the space ship by EVE, that make the captain decide it is time for humans to move back to Earth. WALL-E expresses nostalgia also, by reflecting on romantic themes of older Disney and silent films.<ref name=\"Murray and Heumann, 2009\"/>\n\nStanton describes the theme of the film as \"irrational love defeats life's programming\":<ref name=newsarama2/>\n<blockquote>I realized the point I was trying to push with these two programmed robots was the desire for them to try and figure out what the point of living was&nbsp;... It took these really irrational acts of love to sort of discover them against how they were built&nbsp;... I realized that that's a perfect metaphor for real life. We all fall into our habits, our routines and our ruts, consciously or unconsciously to avoid living. To avoid having to do the messy part. To avoid having relationships with other people or dealing with the person next to us. That's why we can all get on our cell phones and not have to deal with one another. I thought, 'That's a perfect amplification of the whole point of the movie.' I wanted to run with science in a way that would sort of logically project that.<ref name=newsarama2/></blockquote>\n\n===Technology===\nStanton noted many commentators placed emphasis on the environmental aspect of humanity's complacency in the film, because \"that disconnection is going to be the cause, indirectly, of anything that happens in life that's bad for humanity or the planet\".<ref>{{cite news|author=Jonathan L'Ecuyer |title=An Oscar shout-out |work=[[Gloucester Daily Times]] |url=http://gloucestertimes.com/punews/local_story_054221319.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120527035746/http://gloucestertimes.com/punews/local_story_054221319.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 27, 2012 |date=February 23, 2009 |accessdate=March 3, 2009 }}</ref> Stanton said that by taking away effort to work, the robots also take away humanity's need to put effort into relationships.<ref name=robot/> Christian journalist [[Rod Dreher]] saw technology as the complicated villain of the film. The humans' artificial lifestyle on the ''Axiom'' has separated them from nature, making them \"slaves of both technology and their own base appetites, and have lost what makes them human\". Dreher contrasted the hardworking, dirt covered WALL-E with the sleek clean robots on the ship. However, it is the humans and not the robots who make themselves redundant. Humans on the ship and on Earth have overused robots and the ultra-modern technology. During the end credits, humans and robots are shown working alongside each other to renew the Earth. \"''WALL-E'' is not a [[Luddite]] film,\" he said. \"It doesn't demonize technology. It only argues that technology is properly used to help humans cultivate their true nature\u2014that it must be subordinate to human flourishing, and help move that along.\"<ref name=dreher/>\n\n===Religion===\n[[File:Dove Sent Forth from the Ark.png|thumb|upright|The ''Axiom'' and EVE have been compared to the legend of [[Noah's Ark]] and the dove that Noah sets forth from the Ark.]]\n\nStanton, who is a Christian,<ref name=world>{{cite news|author=Megan Basham|date=June 28, 2008|title=WALL-E world|work=[[World (magazine)|World]]|url=http://www.worldmag.com/articles/14127|accessdate=February 19, 2009}}</ref> named EVE after the [[Eve|Biblical figure]] because WALL-E's loneliness reminded him of [[Adam]], before God created his wife.<ref>{{cite news|author=Mark Moring|title=The Little Robot That Could|work=[[Christianity Today]]|date=June 24, 2008|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/movies/interviews/andrewstanton.html|accessdate=November 26, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080731105235/http://www.christianitytoday.com/movies/interviews/andrewstanton.html |archivedate = July 31, 2008}}</ref> Dreher noted EVE's biblical namesake and saw her directive as an inversion of that story; EVE uses the plant to tell humanity to return to Earth and move away from the \"false god\" of BnL and the lazy lifestyle it offers.

It was directed and co-written by [[Andrew Stanton]], produced by [[Jim Morris (film producer)|Jim Morris]], and co-written by [[Jim Reardon]]. It stars the voices of [[Ben Burtt]], [[Elissa Knight]], [[Jeff Garlin]], [[Fred Willard]], [[John Ratzenberger]], [[Kathy Najimy]] and [[Sigourney Weaver]], and was [[List of Pixar films|the overall ninth feature film produced by the company]]. It follows a solitary [[trash compactor]] robot on a future, [[Planetary habitability|uninhabitable]], deserted Earth, left to clean up garbage. However, he is visited by a probe sent by the starship ''Axiom'', a robot called EVE, with whom he falls in love and pursues across the galaxy.\n\nAfter directing ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', Stanton felt Pixar had created believable simulations of underwater physics and was willing to direct a film set largely in space. ''WALL-E'' has minimal dialogue in its early sequences; many of the characters do not have voices, but instead communicate with [[body language]] and robotic sounds designed by Burtt.

Humanity is nowhere to be found, having been evacuated by the [[megacorporation]] Buy-N-Large (BnL) on giant [[Generation ship|starliners]] seven centuries earlier. Of all the robotic [[trash compactor]]s left by BnL to clean up, only one remains operational: a ''Waste Allocation Load-Lifter'' (Earth Class), or WALL-E. One day, WALL-E's routine is broken by the arrival of an unmanned probe carrying an ''Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator'' or EVE, sent to scan the planet for plant life. WALL-E is smitten by the sleek, otherworldly robot, but she goes into [[standby mode|standby]] when he shows her his most recent find: a living seedling. The probe returns to collect EVE and the plant, and with WALL-E clinging on, returns to its mothership, the starliner ''Axiom''.\n\nIn the centuries since the ''Axiom'' left Earth, its passengers have degenerated into helpless corpulence due to laziness and microgravity, their every whim catered to by machines. Captain McCrea, used to sitting back while his robotic lieutenant AUTO flies the ship, is taken aback by a positive probe response and learns that placing the plant in the ship's Holo-Detector will trigger a [[warp drive|hyperjump]] back to Earth so humanity can begin recolonization. The plant proves to be missing from EVE's storage compartment though, and she blames WALL-E for its disappearance.\n\nWith the plant missing, EVE is deemed faulty and taken to Diagnostics. WALL-E proceeds to \"free\" her along with the other faulty robots, causing them to be designated rogue. Frustrated, EVE tries to send WALL-E home on an [[escape pod]], but they are interrupted when AUTO's first mate GO-4 arrives and stows the stolen plant in a pod set to self-destruct. WALL-E saves the plant from being lost for good, and he and EVE reconcile, celebrating with a dance in space around the ''Axiom''.\n\nEVE brings the plant back to McCrea, who watches EVE's recordings of Earth and concludes that they have to go back. However, AUTO refuses, revealing his own secret no-return directive [[A113]], issued after BnL inaccurately concluded centuries ago that the planet could not be saved. When McCrea countermands this directive, AUTO [[mutiny|mutinies]], electrocuting WALL-E and shutting EVE down, and throwing them both down the garbage chute. McCrea struggles with AUTO while EVE, who has been reactivated by a mouse robot, helps WALL-E bring the plant to the ship's Holo-Detector. AUTO crushes WALL-E in the Holo-Detector, but McCrea deactivates AUTO, and EVE inserts the plant, initiating a hyperjump.\n\nArriving back on Earth, EVE replaces WALL-E's circuit, but finds that his memory has been reset and his personality is gone. Heartbroken, EVE gives WALL-E a farewell kiss, which sparks his memory and restores his original personality. WALL-E and EVE reunite as the humans and robots of the ''Axiom'' take their first steps on Earth. During the credits, humans and robots are shown learning to farm, fish, and build, turning the ravaged planet into a paradise, and the plant is shown to have grown into a mighty tree.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ben Burtt]] as WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter: Earth-Class),<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,1813964,00.html|title=WALL-E: Pixar's Biggest Gamble|last=Corliss|first=Richard|date=June 12, 2008|work=Time|access-date=September 23, 2017|issn=0040-781X}}</ref> the [[title character]]. WALL-E, a robot who has achieved sentience, and is the only robot of his kind shown to be still functioning on Earth. He is a small mobile compactor box with all-terrain treads, three-fingered shovel hands, binocular eyes, and retractable solar cells for power. Although working diligently to fulfill his directive to clean up the garbage (all the while accompanied by his cockroach friend named Hal and music playing from his on-board recorder), he is distracted by his curiosity, collecting trinkets of interest from amongst the garbage. He stores and displays these \"treasures\" such as a [[birdcage]] full of [[rubber duck]]s, a [[Rubik's Cube]], [[Zippo]]s, disposable cups filled with plastic cutlery and a golden [[trophy]] at his home where he examines and categorizes his finds. He ignores items valued by humans, throwing away a [[diamond]] ring but keeping the ring box. He neatly organizes his finds at the home he has created, where he watches a [[video cassette]] of ''[[Hello, Dolly! (film)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' via an [[iPod]] viewed through a large [[Fresnel lens]], mimicking the dance sequences.\n** Burtt is also credited for the voice of M-O (Microbe-Obliterator), a tiny, obsessively clean maintenance cleanerbot with a brush in his arms who attempts to keep the ''Axiom'' clean.\n* [[Elissa Knight]] as EVE (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator; which WALL-E pronounces [[Eva (name)|Eva]]),<ref name=\":0\"/> a sleek robot probe whose directive is to locate vegetation on Earth and verify habitability. She has a glossy white egg-shaped body and blue [[LED]] eyes. She moves using [[antigravity]] technology and is equipped with scanners, specimen storage and a \"[[Plasma weapon (fiction)|quasar ion cannon]]\" in her arm, which she is quick to use.\n* [[Jeff Garlin]] as Captain B. McCrea, the commanding officer of the ''Axiom''. He is merely a [[figurehead]], with the ship's autopilot handling all true command functions. He is credited simply as \"Captain\" and his name is only seen on a wall depicting portraits of all the ship's captains.\n* [[Fred Willard]] as Shelby Forthright, the CEO of the Buy-N-Large Corporation and the only major live-action character, shown only in videos recorded around the time of the ''Axiom''{{'}}s initial launch in the early 22nd century. Constantly optimistic, Forthright proposed the plan to evacuate Earth's population to space, then clean up the planet so they could return within five years. However, upon discovering that Earth had become too toxic to support life, the BNL corporation soon abandoned the cleanup and recolonization, issued to all the autopilots of any ''Axiom''{{'}}s the directive to prevent anyone to return to Earth and subsequently dissolved. Forthright is the first (and so far the only) live-action character with a speaking role in any Pixar film.\n* [[John Ratzenberger]] and [[Kathy Najimy]] as John and Mary, respectively. John and Mary both live on the ''Axiom'' and are so dependent on their personal video screens and automatic services that they are oblivious to their surroundings, for instance not noticing that the ship features a giant swimming pool. However, they are brought out of their trances after separate encounters with WALL-E, eventually meeting face-to-face for the first time.\n* [[Sigourney Weaver]] as the voice of the ''Axiom''{{'}}s computer.

Stanton removed this to keep some mystery as to why the plant is taken from EVE. The captain appears to be unintelligent, but Stanton wanted him to just be unchallenged; otherwise he would have not been sympathetic.<ref name=deleted/> One example of how unintelligent the captain was depicted initially is that he was seen to wear his hat upside-down, only to fix it before he challenges Auto. In the finished film, he merely wears it casually atop his head, tightening it when he really takes command of the ''Axiom''.<ref name=evolution/>\n\nOriginally, EVE would have been electrocuted by Auto, and then be quickly saved from ejection at the hands of the WALL-A robots by WALL-E. He would have then revived her by replacing her power unit with a cigarette lighter he brought from Earth. Stanton reversed this following a 2007 test screening, as he wanted to show EVE replacing her directive of bringing the plant to the captain with repairing WALL-E, and it made WALL-E even more heroic if he held the holo-detector open despite being badly hurt. Stanton also moved the moment where WALL-E reveals his plant (which he had snatched from the self-destructing escape pod) from producing it from a closet to immediately after his escape, as it made EVE happier and gave them stronger motivation to dance around the ship.<ref name=deleted/> Stanton felt half the audience at the screening believed the humans would be unable to cope with living on Earth and would have died out after the film's end.

Stanton intended to have many colorful signs, but he realized this would overwhelm the audience and went with Eggleston's original idea of a small number of larger signs.

His answer was it was not; it was a way to answer the question of how would the Earth get to the state where one robot would be left to continue the cleanup by itself. Nevertheless, some critics have noted an incongruity between the perceived pro-environmental and anti-consumerist messaging of the film, and the environmental impacts in the production and merchandising of the film.<ref>[https://governmentcheese.ca/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=14:test&catid=11&Itemid=111 Wall-E (2008) and the Ecological Footprint of Animation Production]</ref>\n\nIn \"WALL-E: from environmental adaption to sentimental [[nostalgia]],\" Robin Murray and Joseph Heumann explain the important theme of nostalgia in this film. Nostalgia is clearly represented by human artifacts, left behind, that WALL-E collects and cherishes, for example [[Zippo]] lighters, hubcaps, and plastic sporks. These modern items that we use out of necessity, are made sentimental through the lens of the bleak future of Earth. Nostalgia is also expressed through the musical score, as the film opens with a camera shot of outer space that slowly zooms into a waste filled Earth while playing \"Put on Your Sunday Clothes\", reflecting on simpler and happier times in human history. This film also expresses nostalgia through the longing of nature and the natural world, as it is the sight and feeling of soil, and the plant brought back to the space ship by EVE, that make the captain decide it is time for humans to move back to Earth. WALL-E expresses nostalgia also, by reflecting on romantic themes of older Disney and silent films.<ref name=\"Murray and Heumann, 2009\"/>\n\nStanton describes the theme of the film as \"irrational love defeats life's programming\":<ref name=newsarama2/>\n<blockquote>I realized the point I was trying to push with these two programmed robots was the desire for them to try and figure out what the point of living was&nbsp;... It took these really irrational acts of love to sort of discover them against how they were built&nbsp;... I realized that that's a perfect metaphor for real life. We all fall into our habits, our routines and our ruts, consciously or unconsciously to avoid living. To avoid having to do the messy part. To avoid having relationships with other people or dealing with the person next to us. That's why we can all get on our cell phones and not have to deal with one another. I thought, 'That's a perfect amplification of the whole point of the movie.' I wanted to run with science in a way that would sort of logically project that.<ref name=newsarama2/></blockquote>\n\n===Technology===\nStanton noted many commentators placed emphasis on the environmental aspect of humanity's complacency in the film, because \"that disconnection is going to be the cause, indirectly, of anything that happens in life that's bad for humanity or the planet\".<ref>{{cite news|author=Jonathan L'Ecuyer |title=An Oscar shout-out |work=[[Gloucester Daily Times]] |url=http://gloucestertimes.com/punews/local_story_054221319.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120527035746/http://gloucestertimes.com/punews/local_story_054221319.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 27, 2012 |date=February 23, 2009 |accessdate=March 3, 2009 }}</ref> Stanton said that by taking away effort to work, the robots also take away humanity's need to put effort into relationships.<ref name=robot/> Christian journalist [[Rod Dreher]] saw technology as the complicated villain of the film. The humans' artificial lifestyle on the ''Axiom'' has separated them from nature, making them \"slaves of both technology and their own base appetites, and have lost what makes them human\". Dreher contrasted the hardworking, dirt covered WALL-E with the sleek clean robots on the ship. However, it is the humans and not the robots who make themselves redundant. Humans on the ship and on Earth have overused robots and the ultra-modern technology. During the end credits, humans and robots are shown working alongside each other to renew the Earth. \"''WALL-E'' is not a [[Luddite]] film,\" he said. \"It doesn't demonize technology.

He argued that the mass [[consumerism]] in the film was not shown to be a product of [[big business]], but of too close a tie between big business and [[big government]]: \"The government unilaterally provided its citizens with everything they needed, and this lack of variety led to Earth's downfall.\" Responding to Coffin's claim that the film points out the evils of mankind, Ford argued the only evils depicted were those that resulted from losing touch with our own humanity and that fundamental conservative representations such as the farm, the family unit, and wholesome entertainment were in the end held aloft by the human characters. He concluded, \"By steering conservative families away from ''WALL-E'', these commentators are doing their readers a great disservice.\"<ref name=\"ford\">{{cite journal | author = Patrick J.

He is shown facing a typological dilemma of classifying a [[spork]] as either a fork or spoon, and his nostalgic interest in the human past further demonstrated by his attachment to repeated viewings of the 1969 film [[Hello, Dolly! (film)|''Hello, Dolly!'']]. Marwick notes that the film features major human evolutionary transitions such as obligate bipedalism (captain of the spaceship struggles with the autopilot to gain control of the vessel) and the invention of agriculture, as part of watershed moments in the story of the film. According to Marwick, one prominent message of the film \"appears to be that the envelopment by technology that the humans in ''Wall-E'' experience paradoxically results in physical and cultural devolution.\" Scholars such as [[Ian Tattersall]] and [[Steve Jones (biologist)|Steve Jones]] have similarly discussed scenarios where elements of modern technology (such as medicine) may have caused human evolution to slow or stop.\n\n===Accolades===\n{{Main|List of accolades received by WALL-E}}\n''WALL-E'' won the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]] and was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]], [[Academy Award for Sound Editing|Sound Editing]], and [[Academy Award for Best Sound|Sound Mixing]] at the [[81st Academy Awards]], which it lost to ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]'' (Original Score, Original Song, Sound Mixing), ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' (Sound Editing), and ''[[Milk (film)|Milk]]'' (Original Screenplay).<ref name=\"Oscars2009\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/81st-winners.html |title=The 81st Academy Awards (2009) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=November 22, 2011|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Oscars 2009: The nominees|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=January 22, 2009|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7842438.stm|accessdate=January 22, 2009}}</ref> Walt Disney Pictures also pushed for an [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] nomination,<ref>{{cite news|author1=Michael Cieply |author2=Brooks Barnes |title=Studios Are Pushing Box Office Winners as Oscar Contenders|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 27, 2008|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/28/movies/28stud.html?_r=1&oref=slogin|accessdate=October 28, 2008}}</ref> but it was not nominated, provoking controversy as to whether the Academy deliberately restricted ''WALL-E'' to the Best Animated Feature category.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Bandyk |first=Matthew |title=Academy Awards Controversy: Wall-E Gets Snubbed For Best Picture Oscar |url=https://www.usnews.com/blogs/risky-business/2009/01/22/academy-awards-controversy-wall-e-gets-snubbed-for-best-picture-oscar.html |publisher=[[U.S. News & World Report]] |date=January 22, 2009 |accessdate=January 22, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717180938/http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/risky-business/2009/01/22/academy-awards-controversy-wall-e-gets-snubbed-for-best-picture-oscar |archivedate=July 17, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> [[Peter Travers]] commented that \"If there was ever a time where an animated feature deserved to be nominated for best picture it's Wall-E.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=Academy accused of snubbing Dark Knight, Wall-E |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/01/23/2473002.htm?section=entertainment |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date=January 22, 2009 |accessdate=January 22, 2009}}</ref> Only three animated films, 1991's ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' and Pixar's next two films, 2009's ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]'' and 2010's ''[[Toy Story 3]]'', have ever been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.

round draw|publisher=UEFA.com}}</ref> The 16 teams were drawn into four groups of four, containing one Path A group winners (seeding position 1), one Path A group runners-up (seeding position 2), and two teams which were either Path A group third-placed teams or Path B group winners (seeding positions 3 or 4). First, the seven teams which were potential hosts were drawn from their own designated pot and allocated to their respective group as per their seeding positions, with the first four teams drawn selected as hosts. Next, the remaining nine teams were drawn from their respective pot which were allocated according to their seeding positions (teams, including potential hosts, which were neither Path A group winners nor runners-up were allocated to first seeding position 4, then seeding position 3). Winners and runners-up from the same Path A group could not be drawn in the same group, but third-placed teams could be drawn in the same group as winners or runners-up from the same Path A group. Teams from the same association could be drawn in the same group. Based on the decisions taken by the UEFA Emergency Panel, teams from Russia and Ukraine could not be drawn in the same group.\n\n;Legend\n*'''(H)''': Elite round hosts selected by draw\n*'''(h)''': Potential elite round hosts not selected by draw\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Advanced from [[#Path A|main round Path A]]\n|-\n!Group\n!width=200|Winners\n!width=200|Runners-up\n!width=200|Third-placed teams\n|-\n!Seed\n|align=center bgcolor=#BBF3BB|'''Seeding position 1'''\n|align=center bgcolor=#BBF3FF|'''Seeding position 2'''\n|align=center bgcolor=#FFFFBB|'''Seeding position 3 or 4'''\n|-\n![[#Group 1|1]]\n|bgcolor=#BBF3BB|{{fbaicon|POR}} [[Sporting CP (futsal)|Sporting CP]] '''(h)'''\n|bgcolor=#BBF3FF|{{fbaicon|SVN}} [[KMN Dobovec|Dobovec]]\n|bgcolor=#FFFFBB|{{fbaicon|BIH}} [[FC Mostar SG|Mostar]]\n|-\n![[#Group 2|2]]\n|bgcolor=#BBF3BB|{{fbaicon|POR}} [[S.L.

round draw|publisher=UEFA.com}}</ref> The 16 teams were drawn into four groups of four, containing one Path A group winners (seeding position 1), one Path A group runners-up (seeding position 2), and two teams which were either Path A group third-placed teams or Path B group winners (seeding positions 3 or 4). First, the seven teams which were potential hosts were drawn from their own designated pot and allocated to their respective group as per their seeding positions, with the first four teams drawn selected as hosts. Next, the remaining nine teams were drawn from their respective pot which were allocated according to their seeding positions (teams, including potential hosts, which were neither Path A group winners nor runners-up were allocated to first seeding position 4, then seeding position 3). Winners and runners-up from the same Path A group could not be drawn in the same group, but third-placed teams could be drawn in the same group as winners or runners-up from the same Path A group. Teams from the same association could be drawn in the same group. Based on the decisions taken by the UEFA Emergency Panel, teams from Russia and Ukraine could not be drawn in the same group.\n\n;Legend\n*'''(H)''': Elite round hosts selected by draw\n*'''(h)''': Potential elite round hosts not selected by draw\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Advanced from [[#Path A|main round Path A]]\n|-\n!Group\n!width=200|Winners\n!width=200|Runners-up\n!width=200|Third-placed teams\n|-\n!Seed\n|align=center bgcolor=#BBF3BB|'''Seeding position 1'''\n|align=center bgcolor=#BBF3FF|'''Seeding position 2'''\n|align=center bgcolor=#FFFFBB|'''Seeding position 3 or 4'''\n|-\n![[#Group 1|1]]\n|bgcolor=#BBF3BB|{{fbaicon|POR}} [[Sporting CP (futsal)|Sporting CP]] '''(h)'''\n|bgcolor=#BBF3FF|{{fbaicon|SVN}} [[KMN Dobovec|Dobovec]]\n|bgcolor=#FFFFBB|{{fbaicon|BIH}} [[FC Mostar SG|Mostar]]\n|-\n![[#Group 2|2]]\n|bgcolor=#BBF3BB|{{fbaicon|POR}} [[S.L.
