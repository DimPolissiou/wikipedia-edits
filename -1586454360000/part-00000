It was founded in 1826 as the '''Maryland Institute for the Promotion of the Mechanic Arts''',<ref name=\":1\" /> making it one of the oldest art colleges in the United States.\n\nMICA is a member of the [[Association of Independent Colleges of Art and Design]] (AICAD), a consortium of 36 leading US art schools, as well as the National Association of Schools of Art and Design (NASAD). The college hosts pre-college, post-baccalaureate, continuing studies, [[Master of Fine Arts]], and [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] programs, as well as young peoples' [[studio art]] classes.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:MDINST.jpg|upright|thumb|\"The Maryland Institute\", above the old \"Centre Market\" on Market Place between East Baltimore Street and Water Street, east of South Frederick Street and west of the [[Jones Falls]] stream, home of M.I., 1851\u20131904]]\n\n=== Maryland Institute for the Promotion of the Mechanic Arts ===\n\nThe Maryland Institute for the Promotion of the Mechanic Arts was established by prominent citizens of Baltimore, such as [[Fielding Lucas Jr.]] (founder of Lucas Brothers - office supply company), [[John H. B. Latrobe]] (lawyer, artist, author, civic leader), [[Hezekiah Niles]] (founder of national newspaper ''Niles Weekly Register'') and [[Thomas Kelso]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZgodAQAAMAAJ&dq|title=The Johns Hopkins University Studies in Historical and Political Science|last=Vincent|first=John Martin|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=1889|isbn=|location=|pages=63|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nOther leaders and officers in that first decade were William Stewart (president), George Warner, and Fielding Lucas Jr. (vice presidents), John Mowton (recording secretary), Dr. William Howard (corresponding secretary), as well as James H. Clarke and D.P. McCoy (managers), Solomon Etting (local merchant/political leader), Benjamin C. Howard, William Hubbard, William Meeter, William Roney, William F. Small, S.D. Walker, John D. Craig, Jacob Deems, William H. Freeman, Moses Hand, William Krebs, Robert Cary Long, Jr. (architect), Peter Leary, James Mosher, Henry Payson (founder of First Unitarian Church), P. K. Stapleton, James Sykes and P. B. Williams. The [[General Assembly of Maryland]] incorporated the Institute in 1826, and starting in November of that year (Tuesday, November 7, 1826), exhibitions of articles of American manufacture were held in the \"Concert Hall\" on South Charles Street. A course of lectures on subjects connected with the mechanic arts was inaugurated, and a library of works on mechanics and the sciences was begun.\n\nThe school operated for a decade at \"The Athenaeum\" (the first of two structures to bear that name, a landmark for educational, social, cultural, civic and political affairs) at the southwest corner of [[List of streets in Baltimore#Lexington Street|East Lexington]] and [[St. Paul Street (Baltimore)|St. Paul]] Streets facing the second [[Baltimore City Circuit Courthouses|Baltimore City/County Courthouse]] between [[St. Paul Street-Calvert Street|North Calvert]] and St. Paul Streets. This first Athenaeum was destroyed by fire on February 7, 1835 along with all of its property and records. The fire was caused by a [[Baltimore bank riot|bank riot]] due to the financial panic following the collapse of several Baltimore banks.<ref name=\"MICA Historical Timeline\">{{cite web|url=http://webprod.mica.edu/About_MICA/Facts_and_History/Historical_Timeline/1824-1835_The_Beginning\u2014Expanding_Education_in_Baltimore.html|title=MICA Historical Timeline|year=2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610134048/http://webprod.mica.edu/About_MICA/Facts_and_History/Historical_Timeline/1824-1835_The_Beginning%E2%80%94Expanding_Education_in_Baltimore.html|archivedate=2010-06-10|url-status=dead|accessdate=2009-08-30}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1847, Benjamin S. Benson and sixty-nine others (including many of the original founders of the former Institute), issued a call for a meeting of those favorable to the formation of a mechanics' institute, which resulted in the reopening of the Institute on January 12, 1848.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe first annual exhibition was held at \"Washington Hall\" in October 1848, followed by two more. The 1948 officers were John A. Rodgers \u2013 president, Adam Denmead \u2013 first vice president, James Milholland \u2013 second vice president, John B. Easter \u2013 recording secretary, and Samuel Boyd \u2013 treasurer. The Institute was reincorporated by the [[Maryland General Assembly|state legislature]] at their December session in 1849 and was endowed by an annual appropriation from the State of Maryland of five hundred dollars. In 1849, the Board of Managers extended the usefulness and broadened the appeal of its programs to ordinary citizens by opening a School of Design and an additional Night School of Design was extended two years later in the new hall and building, under William Minifie (from the Faculty of the old Central High School of Baltimore) as principal of the reorganized Institute. Classes resumed in rented space over the downtown Baltimore branch of the [[United States Post Office Department|U.S. Post Office Department]] in the \"Merchants Exchange\".<ref name=\"1847-1878\">{{cite web|url=http://webprod.mica.edu/About_MICA/Facts_and_History/Historical_Timeline/1847-1878_Renewal_and_Expansion_in_the_Industrial_Age.html|title=1847-1878: Renewal and Expansion in the Industrial Age|year=2009|accessdate=2009-08-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617121707/http://webprod.mica.edu/About_MICA/Facts_and_History/Historical_Timeline/1847-1878_Renewal_and_Expansion_in_the_Industrial_Age.html|archive-date=2010-06-17|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Baltimore City Council|City Council]] in 1850 passed an ordinance granting the Institute permission to erect a new building over a reconstructed \"Centre Market\", laying the cornerstone on March 13, 1851, with John H. B. Latrobe,<ref name=\"MICA Historical Timeline\" /> and son of national architect [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]], (1764\u20131820).\n\nIn 1851, the Institute moved to its own building, built above the old Centre Market on Market Place (formerly Harrison Street) between East Baltimore Street (to the north) and Water Street (to the south) alongside the western shore of the [[Jones Falls]]. Centre Market continued to be known in the city as \"Marsh Market\" after the former Harrison's Marsh from colonial times. The building covered an entire block and had two stories built on a series of brick arches above the market, with two clock towers at each end. The second floor with the Institute, housed classrooms, offices, shops and studios and one of the largest assembly halls/auditorium in the state.\n\nDuring this period the Institute added a School of Chemistry, thanks in part to a bequest from philanthropist [[George Peabody]], (1795\u20131869), (for which the [[Peabody Institute]] and [[George Peabody Library]] is named) and [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|B.& O. Railroad]] President [[Thomas Swann]], along with a School of Music.<ref name=\"1847-1878\" /> Night classes for Design are added for men who work during the day, but would like training in Architecture and Engineering at night. In 1854, a Day School of Design opened for women\u2014one of the first US arts programs for women. In 1860, the Day School for men opened, and in 1870, the Day school became [[co-ed]].<ref name=\"1847-1878\" />\n\n[[Image:1904Fire200.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The Maryland Institute, after the 1904 Fire]]\nFor 79 years the Institute remained in the location above the Centre Market, and its \"Great Hall\", large enough to accommodate 6,000, attracted many famous speakers and lecturers. It hosted events and shows related to the Arts, and as one of Baltimore's largest halls, it hosted important events to the city and the region. In [[Election of 1852|1852]], it hosted both of the National political conventions to nominate presidential candidates [[Winfield Scott]] and his opponent [[Franklin Pierce]] (who was later elected 14th President of the United States).<ref name=\"1847-1878\" />\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], the Institute served briefly as an armory for the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and a hospital for soldiers wounded at the Battle of [[Antietam]].<ref name=\"1847-1878\" /> On April 18, 1864, President [[Abraham Lincoln]] gave his famous speech known as the \"Baltimore Address\" (or \"Liberty Speech\") during a \"Sanitary Fair\" held in the Great Hall to benefit Union soldiers and families.\n\nOn February 7\u20138, 1904, the Centre Market and the Maryland Institute burned down along with 1,500&nbsp;other buildings in downtown Baltimore during the [[Great Baltimore Fire]].<ref name=\"1847-1878\" /> Temporarily, classes moved to spaces above other covered municipal markets in the city, while construction was ongoing in two locations. Michael Jenkins donated the future site of the \"Main Building\" on Mount Royal Avenue near the new [[Bolton Hill, Baltimore|Bolton Hill]] neighborhood in the northwest, which opened in 1908. It was to house the School of Art and Design, and the City of Baltimore offered the old site and funding to rebuild the Centre Market as a location for the Drafting school and \"mechanical arts\".<ref name=\"1905-1960\">{{cite web |title=1905-1960: A Fresh Start\u2014Rise of Mount Royal Campus |year=2009 |url=http://webprod.mica.edu/About_MICA/Facts_and_History/Historical_Timeline/1905-1960_A_Fresh_Start\u2014Rise_of_Mount_Royal_Campus.html |accessdate=2009-08-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226215801/http://webprod.mica.edu/About_MICA/Facts_and_History/Historical_Timeline/1905-1960_A_Fresh_Start%E2%80%94Rise_of_Mount_Royal_Campus.html |archive-date=2012-02-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nUpon opening, the Main building had spaces for pottery, metal working, wood carving, free-hand drafting and textile design, as well as a library, galleries and exhibition rooms. The galleries and exhibition rooms were important, because at the time of construction, Baltimore had no public art museum (institutions such as the [[Walters Art Museum|Walters Art Gallery]] were not founded and opened for regular public viewing until 1909 and acquired by the city in 1934, and the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]], in 1914).\n\nIn 1923, the Institute's galleries hosted the first known public showing of [[Henri Matisse]]'s work in the United States, brought from Europe by sisters Claribel and Etta Cone.<ref name=\"1905-1960\" /> In 1928, the new Centre Market building, now known as \"The Market Place\" building, offered a course in Aeronautics theory and drafting following the great excitement and increase in interest in the industry following [[Charles Lindbergh]]'s flight over the Atlantic Ocean to Paris.\n\n=== Maryland Institute, College of Art ===\n\nThe Institute legally changed its name to the \"Maryland Institute, College of Art\" in 1959, and the \"Market Place Building\" was razed to make room for the extension south of the [[Jones Falls Expressway]] (Interstate 83).<ref name=\"1905-1960\" /> The consolidation of MICA to the Mount Royal campus was furthered by the purchase of the [[Mount Royal Station]], a former [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] (B&O) train station, in 1964. In 1968, MICA was forced to close due to the [[Baltimore riot of 1968]] that followed the assassination of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]\n\nFrom 1972\u20131975, MICA was graced with the presence of artists and critics of the period, including composer [[John Cage]], poet [[Allen Ginsberg]], photographer [[Walker Evans]], master printer [[Kenneth E. Tyler]], painter [[Elaine de Kooning]] and art critic [[Clement Greenberg]].<ref>{{cite web|title=1961-1977: Rapid Strides Forward\u2014Becoming a College|year=2009|url=http://webprod.mica.edu/About_MICA/Facts_and_History/Historical_Timeline/1961-1977_Rapid_Strides_Forward\u2014Becoming_a_College.html|accessdate=2009-08-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226215938/http://webprod.mica.edu/About_MICA/Facts_and_History/Historical_Timeline/1961-1977_Rapid_Strides_Forward%E2%80%94Becoming_a_College.html|archive-date=2012-02-26|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn the following years, MICA expanded along Mount Royal Avenue, adding the \"Fox Building\" in 1978, the \"College Center\" (now the \"Art Tech Center\") in 1986, a renovation of the \"Main Building\" in 1990, \"The Commons\" (added 1992), \"Bunting Center\" (1998), the \"Meyerhoff House\" (2002), the \"Brown Center\" (2003), the \"Studio Center\" (2007) and \"The Gateway\" (2008).

The renovation architect was Cho Benn Holback + Associates, Inc. Kajima Construction Services was the contractor. The Firehouse won an award from the Baltimore Heritage Foundation for preservation in 2004.\n\n===Fox Building===\n[[Image:MICA's FOX Building.jpg|right|thumb|The Fox Building]]\nThe building houses Decker Gallery, Caf\u00e9 Doris, Meyerhoff Gallery, the Center for Art Education, the Division of Continuing Studies, as well as Ceramics, Illustration, Environmental Design, GFA, Drawing and Painting departments, the woodshop, the nature library, and Graphic Design MA (formerly Graphic Design Post-Baccalaureate). The Fox Building offers more than {{convert|60000|sqft|m2}} of usable space.\n\nBuilt in 1915 as the Cannon Shoe Factory, the Fox Building was purchased in 1976. After two years of planning by architects Ayers/Saint/Gross, work began in 1979 and the newly renovated building opened in 1980. This renovation retained most of the warehouse character of the building, including exposed ductwork and framing and the original exterior\u2014The renovations cost $2.5 million, and the building was named for architect Charles J. Fox, a 1965 graduate of MICA whose family contributed over $1.5 million of the renovation cost. After the conversion, the Mount Royal Improvement Association granted MICA an Award of Merit for its contribution to the community.\n\nIn 2005, a second renovation added another gallery and cafe.\n\n===Bank Building (Studio Center)===\nThe {{convert|120000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} building houses the post-baccalaureate certificate program, Hoffberger School of Painting, The Mount Royal School of Art, the Graduate Photographic and Electronic Media program, and [[Senior (education)|Senior]] student studios. Although the official name is ''The Studio Center'', many students know it as ''The Bank Building''.\n\nMICA purchased the former [[JoS. A. Bank Clothiers|Jos. A. Bank]] sewing plant on North Avenue in August 2000. The all-brick building dates to the early 20th century and was home to Morgan Millwork for most of the century. \n[[Image:Brown Center.jpg|left|thumb|The Brown Center]]\n\n[[File:Brown Center MICA interior MD1.jpg|thumb|upright|Brown Center interior]]\n\n===Brown Center===\nThe Brown Center houses MICA's digital art and design programs, as well as the 525-seat Falvey Hall, which, in addition to hosting school-related functions, has also played host to events like the [[Maryland Film Festival]] and National Portfolio Day.

The [[General Assembly of Maryland]] incorporated the Institute in 1826, and starting in November of that year (Tuesday, November 7, 1826), exhibitions of articles of American manufacture were held in the \"Concert Hall\" on South Charles Street. A course of lectures on subjects connected with the mechanic arts was inaugurated, and a library of works on mechanics and the sciences was begun.\n\nThe school operated for a decade at \"The Athenaeum\" (the first of two structures to bear that name, a landmark for educational, social, cultural, civic and political affairs) at the southwest corner of [[List of streets in Baltimore#Lexington Street|East Lexington]] and [[St. Paul Street (Baltimore)|St. Paul]] Streets facing the second [[Baltimore City Circuit Courthouses|Baltimore City/County Courthouse]] between [[St. Paul Street-Calvert Street|North Calvert]] and St. Paul Streets.

The Institute was reincorporated by the [[Maryland General Assembly|state legislature]] at their December session in 1849 and was endowed by an annual appropriation from the State of Maryland of five hundred dollars. In 1849, the Board of Managers extended the usefulness and broadened the appeal of its programs to ordinary citizens by opening a School of Design and an additional Night School of Design was extended two years later in the new hall and building, under William Minifie (from the Faculty of the old Central High School of Baltimore) as principal of the reorganized Institute.

B. Latrobe,<ref name=\"MICA Historical Timeline\" /> and son of national architect [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]], (1764\u20131820).\n\nIn 1851, the Institute moved to its own building, built above the old Centre Market on Market Place (formerly Harrison Street) between East Baltimore Street (to the north) and Water Street (to the south) alongside the western shore of the [[Jones Falls]]. Centre Market continued to be known in the city as \"Marsh Market\" after the former Harrison's Marsh from colonial times. The building covered an entire block and had two stories built on a series of brick arches above the market, with two clock towers at each end. The second floor with the Institute, housed classrooms, offices, shops and studios and one of the largest assembly halls/auditorium in the state.\n\nDuring this period the Institute added a School of Chemistry, thanks in part to a bequest from philanthropist [[George Peabody]], (1795\u20131869), (for which the [[Peabody Institute]] and [[George Peabody Library]] is named) and [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|B.& O.

It hosted events and shows related to the Arts, and as one of Baltimore's largest halls, it hosted important events to the city and the region. In [[Election of 1852|1852]], it hosted both of the National political conventions to nominate presidential candidates [[Winfield Scott]] and his opponent [[Franklin Pierce]] (who was later elected 14th President of the United States).<ref name=\"1847-1878\" />\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], the Institute served briefly as an armory for the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and a hospital for soldiers wounded at the Battle of [[Antietam]].<ref name=\"1847-1878\" /> On April 18, 1864, President [[Abraham Lincoln]] gave his famous speech known as the \"Baltimore Address\" (or \"Liberty Speech\") during a \"Sanitary Fair\" held in the Great Hall to benefit Union soldiers and families.\n\nOn February 7\u20138, 1904, the Centre Market and the Maryland Institute burned down along with 1,500&nbsp;other buildings in downtown Baltimore during the [[Great Baltimore Fire]].<ref name=\"1847-1878\" /> Temporarily, classes moved to spaces above other covered municipal markets in the city, while construction was ongoing in two locations.

The galleries and exhibition rooms were important, because at the time of construction, Baltimore had no public art museum (institutions such as the [[Walters Art Museum|Walters Art Gallery]] were not founded and opened for regular public viewing until 1909 and acquired by the city in 1934, and the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]], in 1914).\n\nIn 1923, the Institute's galleries hosted the first known public showing of [[Henri Matisse]]'s work in the United States, brought from Europe by sisters Claribel and Etta Cone.<ref name=\"1905-1960\" /> In 1928, the new Centre Market building, now known as \"The Market Place\" building, offered a course in Aeronautics theory and drafting following the great excitement and increase in interest in the industry following [[Charles Lindbergh]]'s flight over the Atlantic Ocean to Paris.\n\n=== Maryland Institute, College of Art ===\n\nThe Institute legally changed its name to the \"Maryland Institute, College of Art\" in 1959, and the \"Market Place Building\" was razed to make room for the extension south of the [[Jones Falls Expressway]] (Interstate 83).<ref name=\"1905-1960\" /> The consolidation of MICA to the Mount Royal campus was furthered by the purchase of the [[Mount Royal Station]], a former [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] (B&O) train station, in 1964.

Between the years of 1945 -1975 the population of the city quadrupled due to the high rate of population growth achieved at that time (4.8%) and to migratory movements in the interior of the country. In 2015 the estimated population was 152,051. It is the capital of the [[Comayagua department]] of [[Honduras]] and it is noted for its wealth of Spanish Colonial architecture.  The central square has a cathedral with the oldest clock in the Americas. {{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Elcolegiotridentino.jpg|thumb|Colegio Tridentino de Comayagua|alt=|left|201x201px]]\nDuring the Pre-Columbian era the valley in which the city is located was populated by [[Lenca|Lenca people]]. During the colonization Comayagua was founded with the name ''Santa Mar\u00eda de la Nueva Valladolid'' by [[Conquistador]] [[Alonso de C\u00e1ceres]] under orders from [[Francisco de Montejo]], Governor of [[Yucat\u00e1n (state)|Yucat\u00e1n]] on 8 December 1537. From 1540 on Comayagua was the capital of the Honduras Province of the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]]. The Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, on the main square, was begun in 1563 and inaugurated in 1711.<ref>[http://www.municomayagua.com/comayagua/index.php?id=278 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506233446/http://www.municomayagua.com/comayagua/index.php?id=278 |date=6 May 2012 }}</ref> In 1786, the Spanish Crown created the [[Intendant|''Intendencia'']] of Comayagua, with Comayagua as its capital, which lasted until 1812. From 1812 to 1814 it was the capital of the Province of Comayagua when it again reverted to being the capital of the ''Intendencia'' of Comayagua until 1820.  In 1820, Honduras was again called the Province of Comayagua or Honduras, with Comayagua as its capital.  After independence from the Spanish it was the capital of the state of Honduras in the [[Federal Republic of Central America]]. After Honduras became an independent republic, the capital alternated between Comayagua and [[Tegucigalpa]] (Comayagua being preferred by Conservative administrations, and Tegucigalpa by Liberal ones) before being permanently established at Tegucigalpa in 1880. \n\nIn February 2012 [[Comayagua prison fire|a fire at Comayagua prison]] killed more than 350 people.\n\n[[File:PlazaCentralComayagua.jpg|left|thumb|177x177px|Comayagua's Central Plaza.]]\n\n==Places of note==\nRight in front of the plaza is located City Hall, which has been reconstructed a couple of times. The building is of neoclassic style and was built during the 16th century. The Cathedral de la inmaculada concepcion of Comayagua was built during the colonial era in Honduras. It was inaugurated on 8 December 1711. In the cathedral there is also the oldest clock in America, built by the Arabs during their occupation in Spain around the year 1100. It was moved in the colonial period as a gift from King Carlos III. \n\n==Soto Cano Air Base==\n{{Main|Soto Cano Air Base}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Soto Cano.jpg|thumb|Soto Cano Air Base is home to apx. 550 US military personnel and more than 650 US and Honduran civilians.]] -->\n[[Soto Cano Air Base]] (formerly Palmerola Air Base) is a Honduran military installation located less than {{convert|10|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=off}} from Comayagua.

United States maintains [[Joint Task Force Bravo]] on Soto Cano Air Base with approximately 550 US military personnel and more than 650 US and Honduran civilians.\n\n==Sport==\n{{Main|Estadio Carlos Miranda}}\n[[File:EstadioCarlos Miranda.JPG|right|thumb|260px|Carlos Miranda Stadium: During construction, 2005.]]\nComayagua is headquarters of [[Hispano FC|Club Hispano]], of the Honduran National Soccer League. The club obtained its first promotion to the National League in 2004\u20132005. Nevertheless, after only their first season in the soccer league; they were relegated to second division once again. For this reason the board of directors, bought the first division franchise from Club Municipal-Valencia of Choluteca.  The Club plays its home games at the municipal stadium 'Carlos Miranda' which currently holds about 10,000 spectators.\n\nComayagua was host to the first International Fellowship of Christian Athletes Motocross camp in September 2012. 60 men and women participated in the camp which was instructed by professional riders from the United States, Jimmy Povolny, Shawn Clark and Ryan Meyung among others.

From 1540 on Comayagua was the capital of the Honduras Province of the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]].

From 1812 to 1814 it was the capital of the Province of Comayagua when it again reverted to being the capital of the ''Intendencia'' of Comayagua until 1820.  In 1820, Honduras was again called the Province of Comayagua or Honduras, with Comayagua as its capital.  After independence from the Spanish it was the capital of the state of Honduras in the [[Federal Republic of Central America]]. After Honduras became an independent republic, the capital alternated between Comayagua and [[Tegucigalpa]] (Comayagua being preferred by Conservative administrations, and Tegucigalpa by Liberal ones) before being permanently established at Tegucigalpa in 1880.

The building is of neoclassic style and was built during the 16th century. The Cathedral de la inmaculada concepcion of Comayagua was built during the colonial era in Honduras. It was inaugurated on 8 December 1711. In the cathedral there is also the oldest clock in America, built by the Arabs during their occupation in Spain around the year 1100. It was moved in the colonial period as a gift from King Carlos III. \n\n==Soto Cano Air Base==\n{{Main|Soto Cano Air Base}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Soto Cano.jpg|thumb|Soto Cano Air Base is home to apx. 550 US military personnel and more than 650 US and Honduran civilians.]] -->\n[[Soto Cano Air Base]] (formerly Palmerola Air Base) is a Honduran military installation located less than {{convert|10|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=off}} from Comayagua.

H\u0160K Gra\u0111anski]] or fully ''Prvi hrvatski gra\u0111anski \u0161portski klub'' (English: First Croatian Citizens' Sports Club), club founded in 1911, banned in 1945 and replaced by newly established Dinamo Zagreb. They play their home matches at [[Stadion Maksimir]]. They are the most successful club in [[Football in Croatia|Croatian football]], having won twenty [[Croatian First Football League|Croatian Football League]] titles, fifteen [[Croatian Football Cup]]s and six [[Croatian Football Super Cup]]s. The club has spent its entire existence in top flight, having been members of the [[Yugoslav First League]] from 1946 to 1991, and then the Croatian First League since its foundation in 1992.\n\nAfter the [[Second World War]], the new communist government considered clubs like [[H\u0160K Gra\u0111anski]] as fascist and nationalistic. As such, they were banned, and, in 1945, NK Dinamo was founded as a club to act as an unofficial successor to H\u0160K Gra\u0111anski, getting around the ruling party's disapproval. They entered the Yugoslav First League in its inaugural [[1946\u201347 Yugoslav First League|1946\u201347 season]], finishing as runners-up. In their second season in Yugoslav top flight in [[1947\u201348 Yugoslav First League|1947\u201348]] they finished as Yugoslav champions, which was their first major trophy. The club won three more league titles and seven [[Yugoslav Cup]]s. Amid the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] and formation of the [[Croatian football league system]], Dinamo left the Yugoslav league in 1991. Dinamo are the only Croatian club with European silverware, having won the [[1966\u201367 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]] by defeating [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] in the final. They also finished runners-up in the same competition in [[1965 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final|1963]] when they lost to [[Valencia CF|Valencia]].\n\nUntil the early 1990s, its foundation year was considered to be 1945 but amid political turmoil during the breakup of Yugoslavia the club began claiming direct lineage to pre-WWII clubs [[Gra\u0111anski Zagreb]] and [[HA\u0160K]]. In order to reflect this, in June 1991, it was renamed '''HA\u0160K Gra\u0111anski''', which lasted until February 1993 when it was renamed '''Croatia Zagreb'''. They won five league titles and participated in the [[1998\u201399 UEFA Champions League|1998\u201399]] and [[1999\u20132000 UEFA Champions League|1999\u20132000]] [[UEFA Champions League]] group stages carrying that name before reverting to \"Dinamo Zagreb\" in February 2000. Although the subject was dropped for a while, in 2011, club management increasingly began claiming that Dinamo is the direct descendant of Gra\u0111anski (which had originally been founded in 1911 and disbanded in 1945) and in April that year decided to prepend the adjective \"Gra\u0111anski\" to the club's official name, turning it into the present-day GNK Dinamo (''Gra\u0111anski nogometni klub Dinamo'' or \"Citizens' Football Club Dinamo\").\n\nThe team's traditional colour is royal blue, which has been replaced for European matches in recent times with the darker [[navy blue]]. The club's biggest rivals are [[HNK Hajduk Split|Hajduk Split]], and matches between the two teams are referred to as \"[[Eternal derby (Croatia)|Eternal Derby]].\" One of the club's most notable wins came in the [[2015\u201316 UEFA Champions League]] group stage, which was a 2\u20131 home victory against English side [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/34203643|title=Dinamo Zagreb 2\u20131 Arsenal|date=2015-09-16|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2018-05-30}}</ref> their first ever Champions League victory since the 1999\u20132000 season.

Gra\u0111anski was therefore founded as a [[sports club|multi-sports club]] with a distinctly Croatian identity intended to cater to citizens of [[Zagreb]], with sections dedicated to football, [[Team handball|handball]] and [[cycling]]. At first they used grounds in Zagreb's neighbourhoods of [[Tu\u0161kanac]], Martinovka, Kanal and Maksimir, until they built their own stadium at Kotura\u0161ka street, which was officially opened in 1924 by [[Stjepan Radi\u0107]], a prominent Croatian politician.\n\nInternationally, the club went on several successful tours&nbsp;\u2013 on one of these, in 1923 in [[Spain]], Gra\u0111anski beat [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesb/barca-international.html |title=FC Barcelona&nbsp;\u2013 Complete International Record |date=6 March 2000 |website=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|RSSSF]] |accessdate=2008-06-29 }}</ref> and [[Athletic Bilbao]]. The club often toured to [[Austria]] and [[Hungary]] and played friendly matches with top local sides. In 1936 they went on tour to [[England]] where they adopted the [[Formation (association football)#WM|WM]] [[Formation (association football)|formation]] which helped them win the [[Yugoslav First League 1936-37|1936\u20131937 Yugoslav championship]]. [[M\u00e1rton Bukovi]], who started using the formation as Gra\u0111anski manager in 1936, introduced it to Hungary in the late 1940s and later modified it into the now famous [[Formation (association football)#WW|WW]] system which brought the [[Hungary national football team]] to the final game of the [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954 World Cup]] and which was later exported on to [[Brazil]] as the 4\u20132\u20134 formation.\n\nThe club competed in the [[Mitropa Cup]], the first European international club competition, on three occasions&nbsp;\u2013 in [[Mitropa Cup 1928|1928]], 1937 and 1940. In 1928 Gra\u0111anski were knocked out in the two-legged quarterfinal by [[FK Viktoria \u017di\u017ekov|Viktoria \u017di\u017ekov]] of [[Czechoslovakia]] with 4:8 <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesm/mit28.html |title=Mitropa Cup 1928 |date=10 August 1999 |website=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|RSSSF]] |accessdate=2008-07-01 }}</ref> on aggregate.

One exception was the [[Independent State of Croatia]] (NDH), which enjoyed peace as an Axis member, so the NDH continued to hold national competitions featuring prominent Croatian clubs. Four of these seasons were started ([[Croatian First League 1941|1941]], 1941\u201342, 1942\u201343 and 1943\u201344) but only the second and third editions were finished, with Gra\u0111anski winning the 1942\u201343 season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesk/kroachamp.html |title=Croatia&nbsp;\u2013 List of Champions |date=18 April 2008 |website=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|RSSSF]] |accessdate=2008-06-29 }}</ref>\n\nWhen war ended in 1945 the club was disbanded by the new communist government (along with city rivals [[HA\u0160K]] and [[Concordia Zagreb]]) and its archives were destroyed in retribution for competing in the wartime fascist-sponsored football league. The club's last official game was a 2\u20132 draw against HA\u0160K on 10 April 1945, just before both clubs were disbanded.\n\n===Dissolution of Gra\u0111anski and establishment of Dinamo (1945\u201366)===\nIn the immediate aftermath of [[World War II]], [[Gra\u0111anski Zagreb|Gra\u0111anski]] was disbanded (along with city rivals HA\u0160K and Concordia Zagreb) by a decree issued by the communist authorities in June 1945. On 9 June 1945, just three days after Gra\u0111anski was disbanded, a new [[sports society]] called '''FD Dinamo''' ({{lang-hr|Fiskulturno dru\u0161tvo Dinamo}}) was founded. Soon after the initial meeting, the football section was formed with [[Ico Hitrec]] as the chairman, and some old players and administration members of Gra\u0111anski (Jerko \u0160imi\u0107, Rudolf Sabljak, Otto Hofman, Franjo Starove\u0161ki, Slavko Bobnar, Zvonimir Stankovi\u0107) becoming administration members of the club of which some of them later became presidents. The newly established Dinamo took over Gra\u0111anski's colors and nickname, inherited its pre-war fan base, and in 1969 even adopted a badge strongly resembling Gra\u0111anski's. Many Gra\u0111anski's most notable players continued their career at Dinamo upon its formation (including [[Franjo W\u00f6lfl]], [[August Le\u0161nik]], [[Zvonimir Cimerman\u010di\u0107]], [[Branko Ple\u0161e]], [[Milan Antolkovi\u0107]], [[Mirko Kokotovi\u0107]], Ivica Reiss, Emil Urch and later [[Ivan Jazbin\u0161ek]]) as well as their coach [[M\u00e1rton Bukovi]], physiotherapist Franjo \u017dlof and a significant number of juniors. First generation of Dinamo's youth team was coached by Gra\u0111anski's former goalkeeper [[Maksimilijan Mihel\u010di\u010d|Maks Mihel\u010di\u0107]] who also took the role of a goalkeeping coach. In the first few years, the club played their home matches at Gra\u0111anski's old ground, [[Stadion Kotura\u0161ka]], before moving to a new [[Stadion Maksimir|stadium]] built on place of HA\u0160K's former ground in Maksimir.\n\nFollowing its formation, the club entered Yugoslav First League in its inaugural [[1946\u201347 Yugoslav First League|1946\u201347 season]] and finished runners-up, five points behind champions [[FK Partizan|Partizan]]. In the following [[1947\u201348 Yugoslav First League|1947\u201348 season]], Dinamo won their first trophy after winning the Yugoslav championship with five points ahead of [[HNK Hajduk Split|Hajduk Split]] and Partizan. In the [[1951 Yugoslav First League|1951 season]], the club finished runners-up again, but compensated with their first [[Yugoslav Cup]] title after defeating [[FK Vojvodina|Vojvodina]] 4\u20130 in the two\u2013legged final. Dinamo later added three more cup titles (in 1960, 1963 and 1965) and two championship wins (in [[1953\u201354 Yugoslav First League|1953\u201354]] and [[1957\u201358 Yugoslav First League|1957\u201358]]). In addition, they were also cup runners\u2013up on three occasions (in 1950, 1964 and 1966). Dinamo first entered [[UEFA|European competitions]] in the preliminary round of the [[1958\u201359 European Cup]], but were knocked out by the [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] side [[Dukla Prague]]. The club then had some success in the [[1960\u201361 European Cup Winners' Cup]], as they managed to reach the semi-finals where they lost to Italian side [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]]. They have also competed in the [[1961\u201362 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]], but failed to progress beyond the second round in which they were knocked out by [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]. However, in the [[1962\u201363 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]], Dinamo managed to reach the [[1963 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final|final]], but lost 4\u20131 on aggregate to Spanish side [[Valencia CF|Valencia]]. In the [[1963\u201364 European Cup Winners' Cup]], they made an early exit in the first round after a defeat to Scottish side [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]. During this period, many of Dinamo's star players were also integral part of the [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavian national team]], including [[\u017deljko \u010cajkovski]], [[Zlatko \u0160kori\u0107]], [[Krasnodar Rora]], [[Denijal Piri\u0107]], [[Dra\u017ean Jerkovi\u0107]], [[Ivica Horvat]], [[Slaven Zambata]] and [[Rudolf Belin]].\n\n===Inter-Cities Fairs Cup (1966\u201367)===\n{{Main|1966\u201367 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup|1967 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final}}\nThree Yugoslav clubs went on to participate in the 1966\u201367 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, but they were knocked\u2013out early in the competition, excluding Dinamo, who went on to become the first ever Yugoslavian team that won a European competition. In the first round, Dinamo played against [[1. FC Brno|Spartak Brno]] and after the aggregate score was level at 2\u20132, a [[coin flipping|coin was flipped]] in order to determine the winner. Dinamo was through to the second round, where they were drawn against Scottish side [[Dunfermline Athletic F.C.|Dunfermline]]. For the first time in the history of the Cup, the [[away goals rule]] were introduced, which helped Dinamo qualify for the third round after the aggregate score was 4\u20134 (2\u20130 at home and 2\u20134 away). On their road to finals, they defeated Romanian side [[FC Arge\u015f Pite\u015fti|Dinamo Pite\u015fti]], Italian powerhouse [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] and German side [[Eintracht Frankfurt]]. In the [[1967 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final|finals]] the club was drawn to play its first match at Maksimir against [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]]. Dinamo won 2\u20130 in front of the 33 thousand fans with [[Marijan \u010cer\u010dek]] and [[Krasnodar Rora]] scoring, which was enough to secure the title as the match at [[Elland Road]] finished 0\u20130.<ref>{{Cite web |title = Inter-Cities Fairs Cup 1966\u201367| url = http://www.rsssf.com/ec/ec196667det.html#fc | date = 2008-01-09| accessdate = 10 September 2009}}</ref> The final matches were attended by the then president of [[FIFA]], Sir [[Stanley Rous]], who handed the trophy to Dinamo's captain and top goalscorer [[Slaven Zambata]].\n\n===Post\u2013European success era (1967\u201391)===\nDinamo closed the successful 1960s with Yugoslav Cup title in the 1969 and quarterfinals of the [[1969\u201370 European Cup Winners' Cup|1969\u201370]] Cup Winners' Cup competition. Unfortunately, the success did not follow the club to the new decade, as they failed to win a single trophy throughout the 1970s. The club participated in three more seasons of Inter-Cities Fairs Cup before it was replaced with the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]], but failed to make any impact. Dinamo took part of the initial [[1971\u201372 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup season]], but lost in the second round of the competition to [[SK Rapid Wien|Rapid Wien]] on the away goals rule. The club entered the UEFA Cup on seven more occasions (in [[1976\u201377 UEFA Cup|1976]], [[1977\u201378 UEFA Cup|1977]], [[1979\u201380 UEFA Cup|1979]], [[1988\u201389 UEFA Cup|1988]], [[1989\u201390 UEFA Cup|1989]], [[1990\u201391 UEFA Cup|1990]] and [[1991\u201392 UEFA Cup|1992]]), but never repeated its success from the '60s. Finally, at the beginning of the 1980s, Dinamo won their sixth Yugoslav Cup title, defeating [[Red Star Belgrade]] 2\u20131 on aggregate. They then qualified for the [[1980\u201381 European Cup Winners' Cup|1980\u201381]] Cup Winners' Cup but lost in the first round to [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]]. In [[1981\u201382 Yugoslav First League|1982]], Dinamo sealed their fourth Yugoslav championship and in 1983 won their seventh Yugoslav Cup, the club's last trophy as a part of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]]. After Benfica, another Portuguese club sealed Dinamo's European season, this time in [[1982\u201383 European Cup|1982\u201383]] European Cup when they lost to [[Sporting Clube de Portugal|Sporting CP]]. They played in [[1983\u201384 European Cup Winners' Cup|1983\u201384]] Cup Winners' Cup season and were eliminated, again, by Portuguese side [[FC Porto|Porto]]. The club did not have any success in the second part of the 1980s, save for two consecutive second-place finishes in the Yugoslav championship in [[1988\u201389 Yugoslav First League|1989]] and [[1989\u201390 Yugoslav First League|1990]].\n\n===Croatia Zagreb era (1991\u20132000)===\nAfter the SFR Yugoslavia was dissolved, Dinamo took part in creating the [[Prva HNL|Croatian Football League]] and the initial season was played in [[1992 Prva HNL|1992]]. The same year, the club controversially changed its name to '''HA\u0160K Gra\u0111anski''', and another name change followed in [[1993 in football (soccer)|1993]], when the club was renamed to '''Croatia Zagreb'''. The name change was widely seen as a political move by the leadership of then newly independent Croatia, with the goal of distancing the club from its communist past. As the name change was also never accepted by their supporters, the club renamed themselves back to ''Dinamo'' on 14 February 2000. As Croatia Zagreb, the club won six [[Prva HNL|Croatian championships]], of which five were won in a row from 1996 to 2000. During this period, the club also won the [[Croatian Football Cup|Croatian Cup]] four times.<ref name=nkdzg>{{Cite web | title = Povijest kluba | url = http://www.nk-dinamo.hr/klub-povijest/Default.aspx | accessdate = 10 September 2009 | language = Croatian | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090914234611/http://www.nk-dinamo.hr/klub-povijest/Default.aspx | archive-date = 14 September 2009 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1990s, the club played two consecutive seasons in the [[UEFA Champions League]] group stage. In the [[1998\u201399 UEFA Champions League|1998\u201399 season]], they were drawn in a group with [[Ajax AFC|Ajax]], [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] and [[FC Porto|Porto]]. After disappointing performances in the first three matches, in which they managed to draw against Ajax at home and lost their away matches against Olympiacos and Porto, they performed well in the remaining three matches, beating Porto at home and Ajax away, as well as drawing Olympiacos at home. However, they failed to advance to the quarter-finals as the second-placed team behind Olympiacos. In the [[1999\u20132000 UEFA Champions League|1999\u20132000 season]], they were drawn in a group with defending champions [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] and [[SK Sturm Graz|Sturm Graz]], but managed only a fourth\u2013place finish in the group with two draws and one win. They most notably held Manchester United to a goalless draw at [[Old Trafford (football)|Old Trafford]] in their opening Champions League match that season. The club also competed in two consecutive seasons of UEFA Cup\u2014in [[1996\u201397 UEFA Cup|1996]], they were knocked out in the second round, while in the [[1997\u201398 UEFA Cup|1998]], they managed to reach the third round, losing to [[Atl\u00e9tico Madrid]] 2\u20131 on aggregate score.\n\n===Dinamo Zagreb era (2000\u2013present)===\n{{Main|History of GNK Dinamo Zagreb (2000\u2013present)}}\n\n==== \"Golden Era\" (2000\u20132015) ====\nThe club subsequently participated five times in the third qualifying round of the Champions League, in [[2000\u201301 UEFA Champions League|2000]], [[2003\u201304 UEFA Champions League|2003]], [[2006\u201307 UEFA Champions League|2006]], [[2007\u201308 UEFA Champions League|2007]] and [[2008\u201309 UEFA Champions League|2008]]. However, they played against [[A.C. Milan|Milan]], [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]], [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]], [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]] and failed to win a single match, losing 6\u20131 on [[aggregate score|aggregate]] to Milan, 5\u20131 on aggregate to Dynamo Kyiv, Shakhtar Donetsk and Arsenal and 5\u20133 on aggregate to Werder Bremen. Since the qualifying rounds format changed, Dinamo was unable to get through to the play-off round, losing 3\u20132 on aggregate to [[FC Red Bull Salzburg|Red Bull Salzburg]] in [[2009\u201310 UEFA Champions League|2009]]. Before the UEFA Cup group stage phase was introduced, Dinamo's best success in the competition was reaching the second round of the competition on three occasions. They were able to reach the group stages in [[2004\u201305 UEFA Cup|2004\u201305]], [[2007\u201308 UEFA Cup|2007\u201308]] and [[2008\u201309 UEFA Cup|2008\u201309]], but failed to secure qualification to round of 32. UEFA then introduced [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] competition which had slightly changed format compared to that of the UEFA Cup. Dinamo was able to qualify for the group stage of the initial [[2009\u201310 UEFA Europa League|2009\u201310]] Europa League season after beating [[Scotland|Scottish]] side [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]] 4\u20132 on aggregate.\n\nIn domestic competitions, the club was able to secure five league titles and won the Croatian Cup on six occasions, in addition to four Croatian Supercups. The club has also produced many footballing talents that have represented the [[Croatia national football team|Croatian national team]] on the international level in the 2000s, most notably [[Luka Modri\u0107]], [[Eduardo Alves da Silva|Eduardo]], [[Vedran \u0106orluka]], [[Niko Kranj\u010dar]] and [[Tomislav Butina]]. Dinamo once again qualified for the [[2010\u201311 UEFA Europa League|Europa League in 2010\u201311]], finishing third in group D behind [[PAOK FC|PAOK]] and [[Villarreal CF|Villarreal]] and ahead of [[Club Brugge KV|Club Brugge]]. Dinamo was very close to finishing second after wins against Villarreal at home (2\u20130) and Club Brugge away (0\u20132), but failed to win in their last game against PAOK at home (lost 0\u20131), thus failing to qualify for the next stage.\n\nDinamo managed to reach the group stage of the [[2011\u201312 UEFA Champions League|Champions League in 2011]] after beating [[Neftchi Baku PFK|Neft\u00e7i Bak\u0131]] (3\u20130 at home, 0\u20130 away), [[Helsingin Jalkapalloklubi|HJK Helsinki]] (2\u20131 away, 1\u20130 at home) and [[Malm\u00f6 FF]] (4\u20131 at home, lost 2\u20130 away). They were drawn in group D alongside [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] and [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]]. Dinamo finished last in the group stage, with a \u221219 goal difference and 22 total goals conceded. They lost both matches against all teams\u2014Real Madrid (0\u20131 at home, 6\u20132 away), Lyon (1\u20137 at home, 2\u20130 away) and Ajax (0\u20132 at home, 4\u20130 away). The only highlight of the campaign being two late consolation goals in the final match of the group at the [[Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium]], the only goals Real Madrid conceded in that group.\n\nThe following season, Dinamo once again managed to qualify for the Champions League group stage after defeating [[PFC Ludogorets Razgrad|Ludogorets Razgrad]], [[FC Sheriff Tiraspol|Sheriff Tiraspol]] and [[NK Maribor]]. They were drawn in [[2012\u201313 UEFA Champions League group stage|group A]] alongside [[FC Porto|Porto]], [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] and [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]]. However, they failed to reach the next stage after recording just one point and a \u221213 [[goal difference]], with their best result a 1\u20131 draw with Dynamo Kyiv at the Stadion Maksimir.\n\n==== Recent years (2015\u20132018 ) ====\nIn the [[2015\u201316 UEFA Champions League|2015\u201316 Champions League]], they defeated [[CS Fola Esch|Fola Esch]] 4\u20131 (1\u20131 at home, 3\u20130 away) in the second qualifying round, [[Molde FK|Molde]] 4\u20134 (1\u20131 at home, 3\u20133 away, winning on away goals) in the third qualifying round, and [[KF Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb|Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb]] 6\u20132 (2\u20131 away, 4\u20131 at home) in play-off round, later being drawn into [[2015\u201316 UEFA Champions League group stage|group F]] alongside [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]], where they notably defeated Arsenal 2\u20131 at home on 16 September 2015. The club won the domestic double, securing both the league title and the national cup.\n\nIn the [[2016\u201317 GNK Dinamo Zagreb season|2016\u201317 season]], Dinamo failed to win the league title for the first time since the [[2004\u201305 Croatian First Football League|2004\u201305 season]], and also failed to win the cup for the first time since [[2014 Croatian Football Cup Final|2014]]. In the [[2016\u201317 UEFA Champions League]], they defeated [[FK Vardar|Vardar]] 5\u20133 (2\u20131 away, 3\u20132 at home) in the [[2016\u201317 UEFA Champions League qualifying phase and play-off round#Second qualifying round|second qualifying round]], [[FC Dinamo Tbilisi|Dinamo Tbilisi]] 3\u20130 (2\u20130 at home, 1\u20130 away) and [[FC Red Bull Salzburg|Red Bull Salzburg]] (1\u20131 home, 2\u20131 away after [[Extra Time]]). They were drawn in [[2016\u201317 UEFA Champions League group stage|group H]] against [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]] and [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]]. However, the club endured an extremely unsuccessful group campaign, scoring 0 goals and conceding 15 goals in six matches. The club also failed to win the league title and the cup, losing both trophies to rivals [[HNK Rijeka|Rijeka]]. The 2016\u201317 season was considered by many as one of Dinamo's most unsuccessful seasons in the club's history.\n\nIn the 2017\u201318 season, Dinamo agreed a kit deal with German multinational company [[Adidas]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gnkdinamo.hr/hr/Novosti/Clanak/dinamo-predstavio-adidas-dresove|title=Dinamo predstavio adidas dresove {{!}} Dinamo Zagreb|website=gnkdinamo.hr|language=hr-HR|access-date=2018-04-30}}</ref> Their qualifying campaign for European competition began in the third round, beating Norwegian club [[Odds BK]], 2\u20131 on aggregate (2\u20131 home, 0\u20130 away), but were knocked out by Albanian side [[KF Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb|Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb]] (1\u20131 home, 0\u20130 away, losing on away goals).

The north stand's capacity is nowadays reduced to 9,460 seats.<ref name=stadion/> As for the original grandstand, it is now replaced by three separate stands, although their present-day design came about after a long and toilsome process of numerous renovations, which have started almost immediately after the stadium was rebuilt in 1948. Some of the best [[Architecture of Croatia|Croatian architects]] at the time, such as [[Vladimir Turina]], [[Eugen Erlich]] and [[Franjo Neidhardt]], worked on this project. Prior to [[Croatian War of Independence|Croatian secession]] from the SFR Yugoslavia, the restructuring of the stadium was never completed as thoroughly as it was planned, mostly because of an array of bureaucratic obstacles. Lastly, it was put in order for the [[1987 Summer Universiade]], but even then the final appearance of the stadium was less satisfactory than what was to be expected.<ref name=stadion2/>\n\nSome progress was finally made in 1997 when seats were installed on both the east and south stands. Shortly before the [[Military World Games|1999 Summer Military World Games]], the west and also the largest stand of the stadium was renovated. It comprised 12,600 seats, and a VIP section with 718 seats that also included a presidential lodge.<ref name=stadion/> By this time, the total maintenance expenses for Stadion Maksimir have climbed up to 362.4&nbsp;million [[Croatian kuna|kuna]]. In 2006 the then mayor of Zagreb [[Milan Bandi\u0107]] announced a project worth \u20ac150&nbsp;million that would see Stadion Maksimir once again completely rebuilt.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/na-proljece-pocinje-rekonstrukcija-maksimirskog-stadiona/229618/ |newspaper=Jutarnji list |date=2006-07-27 |language=Croatian |title=Na prolje\u0107e po\u010dinje rekonstrukcija maksimirskog stadiona |trans-title=The reconstruction of the Maksimir stadium to begin in spring |accessdate=2010-06-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318015211/http://www.jutarnji.hr/na-proljece-pocinje-rekonstrukcija-maksimirskog-stadiona/229618/ |archivedate=18 March 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref> By 2010, the taxpayers have vested another 288 million kuna on maintenance and restoration of the stadium, but no significant improvements were made.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/konacna-racunica-za-dinamov-stadion--za-maksimirsko-ruglo-100-milijuna-eura/742272/|title=Tajni tro\u0161kovi: Za maksimirsko ruglo spiskali 100 milijuna eura|trans-title=Secret expenses: 100 million euros squandered on the Maksimir misshapen|newspaper=Jutarnji list|date=2010-04-27|accessdate=2010-06-04|language=Croatian}}</ref> The arranged reconstruction of Stadion Maksimir soon became an enormous financial problem for the city, and for a brief period of time Bandi\u0107 was planning to call a [[referendum]] in which the citizens of Zagreb would decide whether to continue with investments into Stadion Maksimir, or rather to build a brand new [[Stadion Kajzerica]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.24sata.hr/nogomet/maksimirsko-ruglo-treba-li-ga-rusiti-ili-premjestiti-165934|title=Masimirsko ruglo: Treba li ga ru\u0161iti ili premjestiti?|trans-title=The Maksimir misshapen: Ought it be demolished or moved?|publisher=24 sata|language=Croatian|date=2010-03-27|accessdate=2010-06-04}}</ref> The referendum was never held and both projects were ultimately abandoned in 2012.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tportal.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/220689/Bandic-odustao-o-rekonstrukcije-Maksimira.html|title=Bandi\u0107 odustao od rekonstrukcije Maksimira i gradnje Kajzerice|trans-title=Bandi\u0107 gave up on Maksimir reconstruction and building of Kajzerica|last=Brkulj|first=Vedran|date=2012-10-17|work=Tportal.hr|language=Croatian|accessdate=2012-10-17}}</ref> Nevertheless, some crucial work was done between 2011 and 2013, when the club replaced all of the seats from the four existing stands, installed the [[under-soil heating]], ameliorated the interior of the stadium,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.24sata.hr/nogomet/kao-na-svemirskom-brodu-dinamo-ima-nove-svlacionice-304301|title=Kao na svemirskom brodu: Dinamo ima nove svla\u010dionice|trans-title=As if on a spaceship: Dinamo has new lockers|publisher=24 sata|language=Croatian|date=2013-03-01|accessdate=2014-03-18}}</ref> and made some aesthetic adjustments, among others, to the colour of the stands and of the [[tartan track]] surrounding the pitch.

H\u0160K Gra\u0111anski]] or fully ''Prvi hrvatski gra\u0111anski \u0161portski klub'' (English: First Croatian Citizens' Sports Club), club founded in 1911, banned in 1945 and replaced by newly established Dinamo Zagreb. They play their home matches at [[Stadion Maksimir]]. They are the most successful club in [[Football in Croatia|Croatian football]], having won twenty [[Croatian First Football League|Croatian Football League]] titles, fifteen [[Croatian Football Cup]]s and six [[Croatian Football Super Cup]]s. The club has spent its entire existence in top flight, having been members of the [[Yugoslav First League]] from 1946 to 1991, and then the Croatian First League since its foundation in 1992.\n\nAfter the [[Second World War]], the new communist government considered clubs like [[H\u0160K Gra\u0111anski]] as fascist and nationalistic. As such, they were banned, and, in 1945, NK Dinamo was founded as a club to act as an unofficial successor to H\u0160K Gra\u0111anski, getting around the ruling party's disapproval. They entered the Yugoslav First League in its inaugural [[1946\u201347 Yugoslav First League|1946\u201347 season]], finishing as runners-up. In their second season in Yugoslav top flight in [[1947\u201348 Yugoslav First League|1947\u201348]] they finished as Yugoslav champions, which was their first major trophy. The club won three more league titles and seven [[Yugoslav Cup]]s. Amid the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] and formation of the [[Croatian football league system]], Dinamo left the Yugoslav league in 1991. Dinamo are the only Croatian club with European silverware, having won the [[1966\u201367 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]] by defeating [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] in the final. They also finished runners-up in the same competition in [[1965 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final|1963]] when they lost to [[Valencia CF|Valencia]].\n\nUntil the early 1990s, its foundation year was considered to be 1945 but amid political turmoil during the breakup of Yugoslavia the club began claiming direct lineage to pre-WWII clubs [[Gra\u0111anski Zagreb]] and [[HA\u0160K]]. In order to reflect this, in June 1991, it was renamed '''HA\u0160K Gra\u0111anski''', which lasted until February 1993 when it was renamed '''Croatia Zagreb'''. They won five league titles and participated in the [[1998\u201399 UEFA Champions League|1998\u201399]] and [[1999\u20132000 UEFA Champions League|1999\u20132000]] [[UEFA Champions League]] group stages carrying that name before reverting to \"Dinamo Zagreb\" in February 2000. Although the subject was dropped for a while, in 2011, club management increasingly began claiming that Dinamo is the direct descendant of Gra\u0111anski (which had originally been founded in 1911 and disbanded in 1945) and in April that year decided to prepend the adjective \"Gra\u0111anski\" to the club's official name, turning it into the present-day GNK Dinamo (''Gra\u0111anski nogometni klub Dinamo'' or \"Citizens' Football Club Dinamo\").\n\nThe team's traditional colour is royal blue, which has been replaced for European matches in recent times with the darker [[navy blue]]. The club's biggest rivals are [[HNK Hajduk Split|Hajduk Split]], and matches between the two teams are referred to as \"[[Eternal derby (Croatia)|Eternal Derby]].\" One of the club's most notable wins came in the [[2015\u201316 UEFA Champions League]] group stage, which was a 2\u20131 home victory against English side [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/34203643|title=Dinamo Zagreb 2\u20131 Arsenal|date=2015-09-16|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2018-05-30}}</ref> their first ever Champions League victory since the 1999\u20132000 season. Another notable match was a 0\u20130 draw against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the 1999\u20132000 season, who were the European champions at the time, with many fans considering it one of Dinamo's finest performances in the club's history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/history/season=1999/matches/round=1286/match=57088/index.html?iv=true|title=UEFA Champions League \u2013 Man.

Gra\u0111anski was therefore founded as a [[sports club|multi-sports club]] with a distinctly Croatian identity intended to cater to citizens of [[Zagreb]], with sections dedicated to football, [[Team handball|handball]] and [[cycling]]. At first they used grounds in Zagreb's neighbourhoods of [[Tu\u0161kanac]], Martinovka, Kanal and Maksimir, until they built their own stadium at Kotura\u0161ka street, which was officially opened in 1924 by [[Stjepan Radi\u0107]], a prominent Croatian politician.\n\nInternationally, the club went on several successful tours&nbsp;\u2013 on one of these, in 1923 in [[Spain]], Gra\u0111anski beat [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesb/barca-international.html |title=FC Barcelona&nbsp;\u2013 Complete International Record |date=6 March 2000 |website=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|RSSSF]] |accessdate=2008-06-29 }}</ref> and [[Athletic Bilbao]]. The club often toured to [[Austria]] and [[Hungary]] and played friendly matches with top local sides. In 1936 they went on tour to [[England]] where they adopted the [[Formation (association football)#WM|WM]] [[Formation (association football)|formation]] which helped them win the [[Yugoslav First League 1936-37|1936\u20131937 Yugoslav championship]].

Four of these seasons were started ([[Croatian First League 1941|1941]], 1941\u201342, 1942\u201343 and 1943\u201344) but only the second and third editions were finished, with Gra\u0111anski winning the 1942\u201343 season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesk/kroachamp.html |title=Croatia&nbsp;\u2013 List of Champions |date=18 April 2008 |website=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|RSSSF]] |accessdate=2008-06-29 }}</ref>\n\nWhen war ended in 1945 the club was disbanded by the new communist government (along with city rivals [[HA\u0160K]] and [[Concordia Zagreb]]) and its archives were destroyed in retribution for competing in the wartime fascist-sponsored football league. The club's last official game was a 2\u20132 draw against HA\u0160K on 10 April 1945, just before both clubs were disbanded.\n\n===Dissolution of Gra\u0111anski and establishment of Dinamo (1945\u201366)===\nIn the immediate aftermath of [[World War II]], [[Gra\u0111anski Zagreb|Gra\u0111anski]] was disbanded (along with city rivals HA\u0160K and Concordia Zagreb) by a decree issued by the communist authorities in June 1945. On 9 June 1945, just three days after Gra\u0111anski was disbanded, a new [[sports society]] called '''FD Dinamo''' ({{lang-hr|Fiskulturno dru\u0161tvo Dinamo}}) was founded. Soon after the initial meeting, the football section was formed with [[Ico Hitrec]] as the chairman, and some old players and administration members of Gra\u0111anski (Jerko \u0160imi\u0107, Rudolf Sabljak, Otto Hofman, Franjo Starove\u0161ki, Slavko Bobnar, Zvonimir Stankovi\u0107) becoming administration members of the club of which some of them later became presidents. The newly established Dinamo took over Gra\u0111anski's colors and nickname, inherited its pre-war fan base, and in 1969 even adopted a badge strongly resembling Gra\u0111anski's. Many Gra\u0111anski's most notable players continued their career at Dinamo upon its formation (including [[Franjo W\u00f6lfl]], [[August Le\u0161nik]], [[Zvonimir Cimerman\u010di\u0107]], [[Branko Ple\u0161e]], [[Milan Antolkovi\u0107]], [[Mirko Kokotovi\u0107]], Ivica Reiss, Emil Urch and later [[Ivan Jazbin\u0161ek]]) as well as their coach [[M\u00e1rton Bukovi]], physiotherapist Franjo \u017dlof and a significant number of juniors. First generation of Dinamo's youth team was coached by Gra\u0111anski's former goalkeeper [[Maksimilijan Mihel\u010di\u010d|Maks Mihel\u010di\u0107]] who also took the role of a goalkeeping coach. In the first few years, the club played their home matches at Gra\u0111anski's old ground, [[Stadion Kotura\u0161ka]], before moving to a new [[Stadion Maksimir|stadium]] built on place of HA\u0160K's former ground in Maksimir.\n\nFollowing its formation, the club entered Yugoslav First League in its inaugural [[1946\u201347 Yugoslav First League|1946\u201347 season]] and finished runners-up, five points behind champions [[FK Partizan|Partizan]]. In the following [[1947\u201348 Yugoslav First League|1947\u201348 season]], Dinamo won their first trophy after winning the Yugoslav championship with five points ahead of [[HNK Hajduk Split|Hajduk Split]] and Partizan. In the [[1951 Yugoslav First League|1951 season]], the club finished runners-up again, but compensated with their first [[Yugoslav Cup]] title after defeating [[FK Vojvodina|Vojvodina]] 4\u20130 in the two\u2013legged final. Dinamo later added three more cup titles (in 1960, 1963 and 1965) and two championship wins (in [[1953\u201354 Yugoslav First League|1953\u201354]] and [[1957\u201358 Yugoslav First League|1957\u201358]]). In addition, they were also cup runners\u2013up on three occasions (in 1950, 1964 and 1966). Dinamo first entered [[UEFA|European competitions]] in the preliminary round of the [[1958\u201359 European Cup]], but were knocked out by the [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] side [[Dukla Prague]]. The club then had some success in the [[1960\u201361 European Cup Winners' Cup]], as they managed to reach the semi-finals where they lost to Italian side [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]]. They have also competed in the [[1961\u201362 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]], but failed to progress beyond the second round in which they were knocked out by [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]. However, in the [[1962\u201363 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]], Dinamo managed to reach the [[1963 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final|final]], but lost 4\u20131 on aggregate to Spanish side [[Valencia CF|Valencia]]. In the [[1963\u201364 European Cup Winners' Cup]], they made an early exit in the first round after a defeat to Scottish side [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]. During this period, many of Dinamo's star players were also integral part of the [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavian national team]], including [[\u017deljko \u010cajkovski]], [[Zlatko \u0160kori\u0107]], [[Krasnodar Rora]], [[Denijal Piri\u0107]], [[Dra\u017ean Jerkovi\u0107]], [[Ivica Horvat]], [[Slaven Zambata]] and [[Rudolf Belin]].\n\n===Inter-Cities Fairs Cup (1966\u201367)===\n{{Main|1966\u201367 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup|1967 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final}}\nThree Yugoslav clubs went on to participate in the 1966\u201367 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, but they were knocked\u2013out early in the competition, excluding Dinamo, who went on to become the first ever Yugoslavian team that won a European competition. In the first round, Dinamo played against [[1. FC Brno|Spartak Brno]] and after the aggregate score was level at 2\u20132, a [[coin flipping|coin was flipped]] in order to determine the winner. Dinamo was through to the second round, where they were drawn against Scottish side [[Dunfermline Athletic F.C.|Dunfermline]]. For the first time in the history of the Cup, the [[away goals rule]] were introduced, which helped Dinamo qualify for the third round after the aggregate score was 4\u20134 (2\u20130 at home and 2\u20134 away). On their road to finals, they defeated Romanian side [[FC Arge\u015f Pite\u015fti|Dinamo Pite\u015fti]], Italian powerhouse [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] and German side [[Eintracht Frankfurt]]. In the [[1967 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final|finals]] the club was drawn to play its first match at Maksimir against [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]]. Dinamo won 2\u20130 in front of the 33 thousand fans with [[Marijan \u010cer\u010dek]] and [[Krasnodar Rora]] scoring, which was enough to secure the title as the match at [[Elland Road]] finished 0\u20130.<ref>{{Cite web |title = Inter-Cities Fairs Cup 1966\u201367| url = http://www.rsssf.com/ec/ec196667det.html#fc | date = 2008-01-09| accessdate = 10 September 2009}}</ref> The final matches were attended by the then president of [[FIFA]], Sir [[Stanley Rous]], who handed the trophy to Dinamo's captain and top goalscorer [[Slaven Zambata]].\n\n===Post\u2013European success era (1967\u201391)===\nDinamo closed the successful 1960s with Yugoslav Cup title in the 1969 and quarterfinals of the [[1969\u201370 European Cup Winners' Cup|1969\u201370]] Cup Winners' Cup competition. Unfortunately, the success did not follow the club to the new decade, as they failed to win a single trophy throughout the 1970s. The club participated in three more seasons of Inter-Cities Fairs Cup before it was replaced with the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]], but failed to make any impact. Dinamo took part of the initial [[1971\u201372 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup season]], but lost in the second round of the competition to [[SK Rapid Wien|Rapid Wien]] on the away goals rule. The club entered the UEFA Cup on seven more occasions (in [[1976\u201377 UEFA Cup|1976]], [[1977\u201378 UEFA Cup|1977]], [[1979\u201380 UEFA Cup|1979]], [[1988\u201389 UEFA Cup|1988]], [[1989\u201390 UEFA Cup|1989]], [[1990\u201391 UEFA Cup|1990]] and [[1991\u201392 UEFA Cup|1992]]), but never repeated its success from the '60s. Finally, at the beginning of the 1980s, Dinamo won their sixth Yugoslav Cup title, defeating [[Red Star Belgrade]] 2\u20131 on aggregate. They then qualified for the [[1980\u201381 European Cup Winners' Cup|1980\u201381]] Cup Winners' Cup but lost in the first round to [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]]. In [[1981\u201382 Yugoslav First League|1982]], Dinamo sealed their fourth Yugoslav championship and in 1983 won their seventh Yugoslav Cup, the club's last trophy as a part of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]]. After Benfica, another Portuguese club sealed Dinamo's European season, this time in [[1982\u201383 European Cup|1982\u201383]] European Cup when they lost to [[Sporting Clube de Portugal|Sporting CP]]. They played in [[1983\u201384 European Cup Winners' Cup|1983\u201384]] Cup Winners' Cup season and were eliminated, again, by Portuguese side [[FC Porto|Porto]]. The club did not have any success in the second part of the 1980s, save for two consecutive second-place finishes in the Yugoslav championship in [[1988\u201389 Yugoslav First League|1989]] and [[1989\u201390 Yugoslav First League|1990]].\n\n===Croatia Zagreb era (1991\u20132000)===\nAfter the SFR Yugoslavia was dissolved, Dinamo took part in creating the [[Prva HNL|Croatian Football League]] and the initial season was played in [[1992 Prva HNL|1992]]. The same year, the club controversially changed its name to '''HA\u0160K Gra\u0111anski''', and another name change followed in [[1993 in football (soccer)|1993]], when the club was renamed to '''Croatia Zagreb'''. The name change was widely seen as a political move by the leadership of then newly independent Croatia, with the goal of distancing the club from its communist past. As the name change was also never accepted by their supporters, the club renamed themselves back to ''Dinamo'' on 14 February 2000. As Croatia Zagreb, the club won six [[Prva HNL|Croatian championships]], of which five were won in a row from 1996 to 2000. During this period, the club also won the [[Croatian Football Cup|Croatian Cup]] four times.<ref name=nkdzg>{{Cite web | title = Povijest kluba | url = http://www.nk-dinamo.hr/klub-povijest/Default.aspx | accessdate = 10 September 2009 | language = Croatian | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090914234611/http://www.nk-dinamo.hr/klub-povijest/Default.aspx | archive-date = 14 September 2009 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1990s, the club played two consecutive seasons in the [[UEFA Champions League]] group stage. In the [[1998\u201399 UEFA Champions League|1998\u201399 season]], they were drawn in a group with [[Ajax AFC|Ajax]], [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] and [[FC Porto|Porto]]. After disappointing performances in the first three matches, in which they managed to draw against Ajax at home and lost their away matches against Olympiacos and Porto, they performed well in the remaining three matches, beating Porto at home and Ajax away, as well as drawing Olympiacos at home. However, they failed to advance to the quarter-finals as the second-placed team behind Olympiacos. In the [[1999\u20132000 UEFA Champions League|1999\u20132000 season]], they were drawn in a group with defending champions [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] and [[SK Sturm Graz|Sturm Graz]], but managed only a fourth\u2013place finish in the group with two draws and one win. They most notably held Manchester United to a goalless draw at [[Old Trafford (football)|Old Trafford]] in their opening Champions League match that season. The club also competed in two consecutive seasons of UEFA Cup\u2014in [[1996\u201397 UEFA Cup|1996]], they were knocked out in the second round, while in the [[1997\u201398 UEFA Cup|1998]], they managed to reach the third round, losing to [[Atl\u00e9tico Madrid]] 2\u20131 on aggregate score.\n\n===Dinamo Zagreb era (2000\u2013present)===\n{{Main|History of GNK Dinamo Zagreb (2000\u2013present)}}\n\n==== \"Golden Era\" (2000\u20132015) ====\nThe club subsequently participated five times in the third qualifying round of the Champions League, in [[2000\u201301 UEFA Champions League|2000]], [[2003\u201304 UEFA Champions League|2003]], [[2006\u201307 UEFA Champions League|2006]], [[2007\u201308 UEFA Champions League|2007]] and [[2008\u201309 UEFA Champions League|2008]]. However, they played against [[A.C. Milan|Milan]], [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]], [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]], [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]] and failed to win a single match, losing 6\u20131 on [[aggregate score|aggregate]] to Milan, 5\u20131 on aggregate to Dynamo Kyiv, Shakhtar Donetsk and Arsenal and 5\u20133 on aggregate to Werder Bremen. Since the qualifying rounds format changed, Dinamo was unable to get through to the play-off round, losing 3\u20132 on aggregate to [[FC Red Bull Salzburg|Red Bull Salzburg]] in [[2009\u201310 UEFA Champions League|2009]]. Before the UEFA Cup group stage phase was introduced, Dinamo's best success in the competition was reaching the second round of the competition on three occasions. They were able to reach the group stages in [[2004\u201305 UEFA Cup|2004\u201305]], [[2007\u201308 UEFA Cup|2007\u201308]] and [[2008\u201309 UEFA Cup|2008\u201309]], but failed to secure qualification to round of 32. UEFA then introduced [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] competition which had slightly changed format compared to that of the UEFA Cup. Dinamo was able to qualify for the group stage of the initial [[2009\u201310 UEFA Europa League|2009\u201310]] Europa League season after beating [[Scotland|Scottish]] side [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]] 4\u20132 on aggregate.\n\nIn domestic competitions, the club was able to secure five league titles and won the Croatian Cup on six occasions, in addition to four Croatian Supercups. The club has also produced many footballing talents that have represented the [[Croatia national football team|Croatian national team]] on the international level in the 2000s, most notably [[Luka Modri\u0107]], [[Eduardo Alves da Silva|Eduardo]], [[Vedran \u0106orluka]], [[Niko Kranj\u010dar]] and [[Tomislav Butina]]. Dinamo once again qualified for the [[2010\u201311 UEFA Europa League|Europa League in 2010\u201311]], finishing third in group D behind [[PAOK FC|PAOK]] and [[Villarreal CF|Villarreal]] and ahead of [[Club Brugge KV|Club Brugge]]. Dinamo was very close to finishing second after wins against Villarreal at home (2\u20130) and Club Brugge away (0\u20132), but failed to win in their last game against PAOK at home (lost 0\u20131), thus failing to qualify for the next stage.\n\nDinamo managed to reach the group stage of the [[2011\u201312 UEFA Champions League|Champions League in 2011]] after beating [[Neftchi Baku PFK|Neft\u00e7i Bak\u0131]] (3\u20130 at home, 0\u20130 away), [[Helsingin Jalkapalloklubi|HJK Helsinki]] (2\u20131 away, 1\u20130 at home) and [[Malm\u00f6 FF]] (4\u20131 at home, lost 2\u20130 away). They were drawn in group D alongside [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] and [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]]. Dinamo finished last in the group stage, with a \u221219 goal difference and 22 total goals conceded. They lost both matches against all teams\u2014Real Madrid (0\u20131 at home, 6\u20132 away), Lyon (1\u20137 at home, 2\u20130 away) and Ajax (0\u20132 at home, 4\u20130 away). The only highlight of the campaign being two late consolation goals in the final match of the group at the [[Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium]], the only goals Real Madrid conceded in that group.\n\nThe following season, Dinamo once again managed to qualify for the Champions League group stage after defeating [[PFC Ludogorets Razgrad|Ludogorets Razgrad]], [[FC Sheriff Tiraspol|Sheriff Tiraspol]] and [[NK Maribor]]. They were drawn in [[2012\u201313 UEFA Champions League group stage|group A]] alongside [[FC Porto|Porto]], [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] and [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]]. However, they failed to reach the next stage after recording just one point and a \u221213 [[goal difference]], with their best result a 1\u20131 draw with Dynamo Kyiv at the Stadion Maksimir.\n\n==== Recent years (2015\u20132018 ) ====\nIn the [[2015\u201316 UEFA Champions League|2015\u201316 Champions League]], they defeated [[CS Fola Esch|Fola Esch]] 4\u20131 (1\u20131 at home, 3\u20130 away) in the second qualifying round, [[Molde FK|Molde]] 4\u20134 (1\u20131 at home, 3\u20133 away, winning on away goals) in the third qualifying round, and [[KF Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb|Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb]] 6\u20132 (2\u20131 away, 4\u20131 at home) in play-off round, later being drawn into [[2015\u201316 UEFA Champions League group stage|group F]] alongside [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]], where they notably defeated Arsenal 2\u20131 at home on 16 September 2015.

The stadium is situated in the northeastern part of Zagreb, opposite the city's largest [[urban park]], [[Maksimir Park|Maksimir]], which also lends its name to the [[Maksimir|eponymous neighbourhood]]. It was officially opened on 5 May 1912 and has been noticeably upgraded several times thereafter, most recently in 2011. The stadium was initially used by [[HA\u0160K]], and the club became its tenant only in 1948, after the stadium was rebuilt.<ref name=stadion>{{cite web|url=http://gnkdinamo.hr/hr/stadion-maksimir.html |title=Stadion Maksimir |publisher=GNK Dinamo Zagreb |language=Croatian |accessdate=2014-03-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329044121/https://gnkdinamo.hr/hr/stadion-maksimir.html |archivedate=29 March 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref> Before moving to Maksimir, the club played its home matches at the former [[H\u0160K Gra\u0111anski Zagreb|Gra\u0111anski Zagreb's]] stadium [[Stadion Kotura\u0161ka]]. It is there that the club played its first official match on 23 June 1945. Its first match at the Stadion Maksimir was played on 19 September 1948 in front of a crowd of 40,000 spectators.<ref name=stadion2>{{cite web|url=http://povijestdinama.com/index.php/2011-08-04-23-47-02/stadion|title=Dinamov stadion|trans-title=Dinamo's stadium|language=Croatian|publisher=Povijestdinama.com|accessdate=2014-03-17}}</ref>\n\nThe design of Stadion Maksimir initially included a single [[grandstand]] in a shape of a [[horseshoe]] that faced the other, much smaller stand to the north.<ref name=stadion2/> The north stand was altered from the ground up in 1998, when it was replaced by a 10,965 all-seater stand, and also a building with 15,000 square meters of office space covered in a glazed fa\u00e7ade. The north stand's capacity is nowadays reduced to 9,460 seats.<ref name=stadion/> As for the original grandstand, it is now replaced by three separate stands, although their present-day design came about after a long and toilsome process of numerous renovations, which have started almost immediately after the stadium was rebuilt in 1948. Some of the best [[Architecture of Croatia|Croatian architects]] at the time, such as [[Vladimir Turina]], [[Eugen Erlich]] and [[Franjo Neidhardt]], worked on this project. Prior to [[Croatian War of Independence|Croatian secession]] from the SFR Yugoslavia, the restructuring of the stadium was never completed as thoroughly as it was planned, mostly because of an array of bureaucratic obstacles. Lastly, it was put in order for the [[1987 Summer Universiade]], but even then the final appearance of the stadium was less satisfactory than what was to be expected.<ref name=stadion2/>\n\nSome progress was finally made in 1997 when seats were installed on both the east and south stands. Shortly before the [[Military World Games|1999 Summer Military World Games]], the west and also the largest stand of the stadium was renovated. It comprised 12,600 seats, and a VIP section with 718 seats that also included a presidential lodge.<ref name=stadion/> By this time, the total maintenance expenses for Stadion Maksimir have climbed up to 362.4&nbsp;million [[Croatian kuna|kuna]].
