This consortium is typically formed for the specific purpose of providing the PFI.<ref name=zheng>{{cite web|url=https://www.scopus.com/record/display.url?eid=2-s2.0-41049112855&origin=inward&txGid=yXIvJQ7AsPq0YyDQfJmJLCa%3a2|author=Zheng, J.

Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management. 14(1): 43-54.|accessdate=30 September 2012}}</ref> It is owned by a number of private sector investors, usually including a construction company and a service provider, and often a bank as well.<ref name=zheng/> The consortium's funding will be used to build the facility and to undertake maintenance and [[Capital (economics)|capital]] replacement during the life-cycle of the contract. Once the contract is operational, the SPV may be used as a [[wikt:conduit|conduit]] for contract amendment discussions between the customer and the facility operator. SPVs often charge fees for this go-between 'service'.<ref name=\"Pickard 2008\"/>\n\nPFI contracts are typically for 25\u201330 years (depending on the type of project); although contracts less than 20 years or more than 40 years exist, they are considerably less common.<ref name=\"puk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.partnershipsuk.org.uk/|title=homepage|publisher=Partnerships UK}}</ref> During the period of the contract the consortium will provide certain services, which were previously provided by the public sector. The consortium is paid for the work over the course of the contract on a \"no service no fee\" performance basis.\n\nThe public authority will design an \"output specification\" which is a document setting out what the consortium is expected to achieve. If the consortium fails to meet any of the agreed standards it should lose an element of its payment until standards improve. If standards do not improve after an agreed period, the public sector authority is usually entitled to terminate the contract, compensate the consortium where appropriate, and take ownership of the project.\n\nTermination procedures are highly complex, as most projects are not able to secure private financing without assurances that the debt financing of the project will be repaid in the case of termination. In most termination cases the public sector is required to repay the debt and take ownership of the project. In practice, termination is considered a last resort only.\n\nWhether public interest is at all protected by a particular PFI contract is highly dependent on how well or badly the contract was written and the determination (or not) and capacity of the contracting authority to enforce it. Many steps have been taken over the years to standardise the form of PFI contracts to ensure public interests are better protected.\n\n===Structure of providers===\nThe typical PFI provider is organized into three parts or [[Legal person|legal entities]]: a [[holding company]] (called \"Topco\") which is the same as the SPV mentioned above, a capital equipment or infrastructure provision company (called \"Capco\"),  and a services or operating company (called \"Opco\").  The main contract is between the public sector authority and the Topco.  Requirements then 'flow down' from the Topco to the Capco and Opco via secondary contracts. Further requirements then flow down to [[subcontractor]]s, again with contracts to match. Often the main subcontractors are companies with the same [[shareholders]] as the Topco.\n\n===Method of funding===\nPrior to the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132010]], large PFI projects were funded through the sale of [[bond (finance)|bonds]] and/or [[senior debt]]. Since the crisis, funding by [[senior debt]] has become more common. Smaller PFI projects \u2014 the majority by number \u2014 have typically always been funded directly by banks in the form of senior debt. Senior debt is generally slightly more expensive than bonds, which the banks would argue is due to their more accurate understanding of the credit-worthiness of PFI deals \u2014 they may consider that [[monoline]] providers underestimate the risk, especially during the construction stage, and hence can offer a better price than the banks are willing to.\n\nRefinancing of PFI deals is common. Once construction is complete, the risk profile of a project can be lower, so cheaper debt can be obtained. This refinancing might in the future be done via bonds \u2014 the construction stage is financed using bank debt, and then bonds for the much longer period of operation.\n\nThe banks who fund PFI projects are repaid by the consortium from the money received from the government during the lifespan of the contract. From the point of view of the private sector, PFI borrowing is considered low risk because public sector authorities are very unlikely to [[Default (finance)|default]]. Indeed, under [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] rules, national governments are not permitted to go bankrupt (although this is sometimes ignored, as when [[Argentine debt restructuring|Argentina 'restructured' its foreign debt]]). Repayment depends entirely on the ability of the consortium to deliver the services in accordance with the output specified in the contract.\n\n==United Kingdom==\n===Development===\nIn 1992<ref>{{cite web|url=https://navigator.health.org.uk/content/private-finance-initiative-pfi-was-introduced|title=The Private Finance Initiative (PFI) was introduced|publisher=The Health Foundation|access-date=8 Dec 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cps.org.uk/files/reports/original/111028110829-PFI.pdf|title=Reforming The Private Finance Initiative|publisher=Centre for Policy Studies|access-date=8 Dec 2019}}</ref> PFI was implemented for the first time in the UK by the Conservative Government led by John Major.

This position has been supported by the UK National Audit Office with regard to certain projects. However, critics claim that many uses of PFI are ideological rather than practical; Pollock recalls a meeting with the then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Gordon Brown]] who could not provide a rationale for PFI other than to \"declare repeatedly that the public sector is bad at management, and that only the private sector is efficient and can manage services well.\"<ref name=\"Pollock 2005 3\">{{Citation\n  | last = Pollock\n  | first = Allyson\n  | title = NHS Plc: The Privatisation of Our Health Care\n  | publisher = [[Verso]]\n  | year = 2005\n  | page = 3\n  | isbn = 1-84467-539-4}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003 the Labour Government used [[Public-private partnership]] (PPP) schemes for the privatisation of [[London Underground]]'s infrastructure and rolling stock.

For example, in 2005 a confidential government report condemned the PFI-funded Newsam Centre at [[Seacroft Hospital]] for jeopardising the lives of 300 patients and staff. The Newsam Centre is for people with lifelong learning difficulties and the mentally ill. The report said that there were shortcomings \"in each of the five key areas of documentation, design, construction, operation and management\" at the hospital, which cost \u00a347m. Between 2001-5 there were four patient suicides, including one which was left undiscovered for four days in an out-of-order bathroom. The coroner said that Leeds Mental Health Teaching NHS Trust, which is responsible for the facility, had failed to keep patients under proper observation. The government report said that the design and construction of the building did not meet the requirements for a facility for mental patients. The building has curving corridors which make patient observation and quick evacuation difficult. The report said that the building also constituted a fire hazard, as it was constructed without proper fire protection materials in the wall and floor joints. In addition, mattresses and chairs used below-standard fire-retardant materials. Patients were allowed to smoke in rooms where they could not be easily observed. The fire-safety manual was described as \"very poor\", and the fire-safety procedure consisted of a post-it note marked \"to be provided by the Trust\". The report concluded that \"every section of the fire safety code\" had been breached.<ref name=\"pplr\">{{Citation| last = Hencke| first = David| title = Private Finance Hospital 'Putting Lives At Risk'| newspaper = The Guardian| date = 17 June 2005| url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jun/17/publicservices.politics| location=London}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, the building of two new PFI Police Stations on behalf of Kent Police serving the Medway area and the North Kent area (Gravesend and Dartford) is credited as a successful PFI project.

The contracts vary greatly in size. Most include the cost of running services such as facilities management, hospital portering and patient food, and these amount to around 40% of the cost. Total repayments will cost around \u00a32.1 billion in 2017 and will reach a peak in 2029.

Fielden cited the example of [[University Hospital Coventry]] where the NHS Trust was forced to borrow money to make the first \u00a354m payment owed to the PFI contractor. He said that the trust was in the ignominious position of struggling for money before the hospital's doors even opened. The trust could not afford to run all the services that it had commissioned and was having to mothball services and close wards.<ref name=\"phpc\"/>\n\n[[File:University hospital coventry1 5u07.JPG|thumb|right|250px|University Hospital Coventry]]\nThe high cost of hospitals built under PFI is forcing service cuts at neighbouring hospitals built with public money.

The paper attributed the debts in part to their high fixed PFI costs and suggested that the same would soon apply to Lewisham Hospital.\n\nIn 2012, seven NHS trusts were unable to meet the repayments for their private finance schemes and were given \u00a31.5 billion in emergency funding, to help them avoid cutting patient services.<ref>{{cite news|title=NHS trusts struggling with PFI debts to get help|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/28/nhs-trusts-pfi-debts-help|accessdate=5 October 2014|newspaper=Guardian|date=28 August 2012}}</ref>\n* [[Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust]]\n* [[Dartford and Gravesham NHS Trust]]\n* [[Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust]]\n* [[North Cumbria University Hospitals NHS Trust]]\n* [[Peterborough and Stamford Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust]]\n* [[St Helens and Knowsley Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust]]\n* [[South London Healthcare NHS Trust]]\n\nPeter Dixon, Chairman of [[University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust]], with the largest PFI-built hospital in England, has gone on the record to say:\n\n{{quote|We now have indexed payments for the next 35 years which at a time of growing concern over NHS budgets can only be a millstone.

In many cases this results in worse terms of employment and pension rights. Heather Wakefield, [[UNISON]]'s national secretary for local government, has said:\n\n{{quote|Local authorities and health authorities have very good final-salary pension schemes.

This [[finance|fiscal]] technicality can be convenient for governments. In his paper on PFI in Spain, Jos\u00e9 Francisco Bellod Redondo notes that one of the main drivers for PFI in Spain is [[Compliance (regulation)|compliance]] with the fiscal restrictions imposed under the [[Maastricht Treaty]] and [[Stability and Growth Pact]], which set concrete limits to the national debt.<ref>{{Citation\n |last      = Bellod Redondo\n |first     = Jos\u00e9 Francisco\n |title     = Financiaci\u00f3n privada de infraestructuras: El caso de la Autov\u00eda del Noroeste\n |publisher = Instituto de Estudios Fiscales\n |date      = November 2006\n |url       = http://www.ief.es/Publicaciones/revistas/PGP/44_Autovia.pdf\n}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn the UK, the technical reason why PFI debts are off-balance-sheet is that the government authority taking out the PFI theoretically transfers one or more of the following risks to the private sector: risk associated with demand for the facility (e.g. under-utilisation); risk associated with construction of the facility (e.g. overspend and delay); or risk associated with the 'availability' of the facility. The PFI contract bundles the payment to the private sector as a single ('unitary') charge for both the initial capital spend and the ongoing maintenance and operation costs. Because of supposed risk transfer, the entire contract is deemed to be revenue rather than capital spending. As a result, no capital spend appears on the government's balance sheet (the revenue expenditure would not have been on the government balance sheet in any event). Public accounting standards are being changed to bring these numbers back onto the balance sheet.<ref name=Economist1/> For example, in 2007 Neil Bentley, the [[Confederation of British Industry|CBI]]'s Director of Public Services, told a conference that the CBI was keen for the government to press ahead with accounting rule changes that would put large numbers of PFI projects onto the government's books. He was concerned that accusations of \"accounting tricks\" were delaying PFI projects.<ref>{{Citation  | last=Timmins  | first=Nicholas  | title=Treasury to ensure taxpayer is not the loser in PFI deals  | newspaper=Financial Times  | date=17 October 2008  | url=http://www.ft.com}}</ref>\n\n====Risk====\nSupporters of PFI claim that risk is successfully transferred from public to private sectors as a result of PFI, and that the private sector is better at [[risk management]]. As an example of successful risk transfer they cite the case of the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|National Physical Laboratory]]. This deal ultimately caused the collapse of the building contractor Laser (a [[joint venture]] between [[Serco]] and [[John Laing plc|John Laing]]) when the cost of the complex scientific laboratory, which was ultimately built, was very much larger than estimated.<ref name=\"tcnp\"/>\n\nOn the other hand, Allyson Pollock argues that in many PFI projects risks are not in fact transferred to the private sector<ref name=\"Pollock 2005 3\"/> and, based on the research findings of Pollock and others, George Monbiot argues<ref name=\"bwry\"/> that the calculation of risk in PFI projects is highly subjective, and is skewed to favour the private sector:\n\n{{quote|When private companies take on a PFI project, they are deemed to acquire risks the state would otherwise have carried.

The committee said it was \"a very serious blow indeed\" for the government's own tax-collecting services to have entered into the contract with Mapeley, whom they described as \"tax avoiders\". Conservative MP [[Edward Leigh]] said there were \"significant weaknesses\" in the way the contract was negotiated. The government agencies had failed to clarify Mapeley's tax plans until a late stage in the negotiations.

[[Edward Leigh]], then [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] chair of the [[Public Accounts Committee (United Kingdom)|Public Accounts Committee]] which oversees the work of the NAO, said: \"By introducing a private finance element to the deal, the MoD managed to turn what should have been a relatively straightforward procurement into a bureaucratic nightmare\". The NAO criticised the MoD for failing to carry out a \"sound evaluation of alternative procurement routes\" because there had been the \"assumption\" in the ministry that the aircraft must be provided through a PFI deal in order to keep the numbers off the balance sheet, due to \"affordability pressures and the prevailing policy to use PFI wherever possible\".<ref name='Norton-Taylor 2010'>{{Citation\n  | last = Norton-Taylor\n  | first = Richard\n  | title = Audit office slams MoD's PFI nightmare\n  | publisher = The Guardian\n  | date = 30 March 2010\n  | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/6647783.stm\n  | accessdate = 23 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n====Complexity====\nCritics claim that the complexity of many PFI projects is a barrier to accountability.

The TTF initially consisted of a policy arm staffed by five civil servants, and a projects section employing eight private sector executives led by [[Adrian Montague]], formally co-head of Global Project Finance at [[investment bank]] Dresdner Kleinwort Benson. In 1999 the policy arm was moved to the [[Office of Government Commerce]] (OGC), but it was subsequently moved back to the Treasury. The projects section was part-privatised and became [[Partnerships UK]] (PUK). The Treasury retained a 49% '[[golden share]]', while the majority stake in PUK was owned by private sector investors. PUK was then staffed almost entirely by private sector procurement specialists such as corporate lawyers, [[investment banking|investment bankers]], consultants and so forth.

It provides reports on the value for money of many PFI transactions and makes recommendations. The [[Public Accounts Committee (United Kingdom)|Public Accounts Committee]] also provides reports on these issues at a UK-wide level. The [[devolution|devolved]] governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have their own equivalents of the NAO such as the Wales Audit Office and the Northern Ireland Audit Office which review PFI projects in their respective localities. In recent years the Finance Committees of the [[Scottish Parliament]] and the [[National Assembly for Wales]] have held enquiries into whether PFI represents good value for money.\n\n====Local government====\nPFI is used in both central and local government. In the case of local government projects, the [[Capital (economics)|capital]] element of the funding which enables the [[local authority]] to pay the private sector for these projects is given by central government in the form of what are known as PFI \"credits\". The local authority then selects a private company to perform the work, and transfers detailed control of the project, and in theory the [[risk]], to the company.\n\n====Appraisal process====\n[[Jeremy Colman]], former deputy general of the [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] and [[Auditor General for Wales]] is quoted in the [[Financial Times]] saying that many PFI appraisals suffer from \"spurious precision\" and others are based on \"pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo\". Some, he says, are simply \"utter rubbish\". He noted government pressures on contracting authorities to weight their appraisals in favour of taking their projects down the PFI route: \"If the answer comes out wrong you don't get your project. So the answer doesn't come out wrong very often.\"<ref>{{Citation| last = Timmins| first = N.| title = Warning of 'Spurious' Figures on Value of PFI| newspaper = The Financial Times| date = 5 June 2002| url = http://www.ft.com}}</ref>\n\nIn a paper published in the [[British Medical Journal]], the magazine of the medical trade union, the BMA, a team consisting of two [[public health]] specialists and an economist concluded that many PFI appraisals do not correctly calculate the true risks involved. They argued that the appraisal system is highly subjective in its evaluation of risk transferral to the private sector. An example was an NHS project where the risk that clinical cost savings might not be achieved was theoretically transferred to the private sector. In the appraisal this risk was valued at \u00a35m but in practice the private contractor had no responsibility for ensuring clinical cost-savings and faced no penalty if there were none.

This consortium is typically formed for the specific purpose of providing the PFI.<ref name=zheng>{{cite web|url=https://www.scopus.com/record/display.url?eid=2-s2.0-41049112855&origin=inward&txGid=yXIvJQ7AsPq0YyDQfJmJLCa%3a2|author=Zheng, J.

Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management. 14(1): 43-54.|accessdate=30 September 2012}}</ref> It is owned by a number of private sector investors, usually including a construction company and a service provider, and often a bank as well.<ref name=zheng/> The consortium's funding will be used to build the facility and to undertake maintenance and [[Capital (economics)|capital]] replacement during the life-cycle of the contract. Once the contract is operational, the SPV may be used as a [[wikt:conduit|conduit]] for contract amendment discussions between the customer and the facility operator. SPVs often charge fees for this go-between 'service'.<ref name=\"Pickard 2008\"/>\n\nPFI contracts are typically for 25\u201330 years (depending on the type of project); although contracts less than 20 years or more than 40 years exist, they are considerably less common.<ref name=\"puk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.partnershipsuk.org.uk/|title=homepage|publisher=Partnerships UK}}</ref> During the period of the contract the consortium will provide certain services, which were previously provided by the public sector. The consortium is paid for the work over the course of the contract on a \"no service no fee\" performance basis.\n\nThe public authority will design an \"output specification\" which is a document setting out what the consortium is expected to achieve. If the consortium fails to meet any of the agreed standards it should lose an element of its payment until standards improve. If standards do not improve after an agreed period, the public sector authority is usually entitled to terminate the contract, compensate the consortium where appropriate, and take ownership of the project.\n\nTermination procedures are highly complex, as most projects are not able to secure private financing without assurances that the debt financing of the project will be repaid in the case of termination. In most termination cases the public sector is required to repay the debt and take ownership of the project. In practice, termination is considered a last resort only.\n\nWhether public interest is at all protected by a particular PFI contract is highly dependent on how well or badly the contract was written and the determination (or not) and capacity of the contracting authority to enforce it. Many steps have been taken over the years to standardise the form of PFI contracts to ensure public interests are better protected.\n\n===Structure of providers===\nThe typical PFI provider is organized into three parts or [[Legal person|legal entities]]: a [[holding company]] (called \"Topco\") which is the same as the SPV mentioned above, a capital equipment or infrastructure provision company (called \"Capco\"),  and a services or operating company (called \"Opco\").  The main contract is between the public sector authority and the Topco.  Requirements then 'flow down' from the Topco to the Capco and Opco via secondary contracts. Further requirements then flow down to [[subcontractor]]s, again with contracts to match. Often the main subcontractors are companies with the same [[shareholders]] as the Topco.\n\n===Method of funding===\nPrior to the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132010]], large PFI projects were funded through the sale of [[bond (finance)|bonds]] and/or [[senior debt]]. Since the crisis, funding by [[senior debt]] has become more common. Smaller PFI projects \u2014 the majority by number \u2014 have typically always been funded directly by banks in the form of senior debt. Senior debt is generally slightly more expensive than bonds, which the banks would argue is due to their more accurate understanding of the credit-worthiness of PFI deals \u2014 they may consider that [[monoline]] providers underestimate the risk, especially during the construction stage, and hence can offer a better price than the banks are willing to.\n\nRefinancing of PFI deals is common. Once construction is complete, the risk profile of a project can be lower, so cheaper debt can be obtained. This refinancing might in the future be done via bonds \u2014 the construction stage is financed using bank debt, and then bonds for the much longer period of operation.\n\nThe banks who fund PFI projects are repaid by the consortium from the money received from the government during the lifespan of the contract. From the point of view of the private sector, PFI borrowing is considered low risk because public sector authorities are very unlikely to [[Default (finance)|default]]. Indeed, under [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] rules, national governments are not permitted to go bankrupt (although this is sometimes ignored, as when [[Argentine debt restructuring|Argentina 'restructured' its foreign debt]]). Repayment depends entirely on the ability of the consortium to deliver the services in accordance with the output specified in the contract.\n\n==United Kingdom==\n===Development===\nIn 1992<ref>{{cite web|url=https://navigator.health.org.uk/content/private-finance-initiative-pfi-was-introduced|title=The Private Finance Initiative (PFI) was introduced|publisher=The Health Foundation|access-date=8 Dec 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cps.org.uk/files/reports/original/111028110829-PFI.pdf|title=Reforming The Private Finance Initiative|publisher=Centre for Policy Studies|access-date=8 Dec 2019}}</ref> PFI was implemented for the first time in the UK by the Conservative Government led by John Major.

But, at the time, [[Vince Cable]] of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], subsequently [[Secretary of State for Business]] in the [[Coalition Government 2010\u20132015|coalition]], argued in favour of traditional public financing structures instead of propping up PFI with public money:\n\n{{quote|The whole thing has become terribly opaque and dishonest and it's a way of hiding obligations.

For example, in 2005 a confidential government report condemned the PFI-funded Newsam Centre at [[Seacroft Hospital]] for jeopardising the lives of 300 patients and staff. The Newsam Centre is for people with lifelong learning difficulties and the mentally ill. The report said that there were shortcomings \"in each of the five key areas of documentation, design, construction, operation and management\" at the hospital, which cost \u00a347m. Between 2001-5 there were four patient suicides, including one which was left undiscovered for four days in an out-of-order bathroom. The coroner said that Leeds Mental Health Teaching NHS Trust, which is responsible for the facility, had failed to keep patients under proper observation. The government report said that the design and construction of the building did not meet the requirements for a facility for mental patients. The building has curving corridors which make patient observation and quick evacuation difficult. The report said that the building also constituted a fire hazard, as it was constructed without proper fire protection materials in the wall and floor joints. In addition, mattresses and chairs used below-standard fire-retardant materials. Patients were allowed to smoke in rooms where they could not be easily observed. The fire-safety manual was described as \"very poor\", and the fire-safety procedure consisted of a post-it note marked \"to be provided by the Trust\". The report concluded that \"every section of the fire safety code\" had been breached.<ref name=\"pplr\">{{Citation| last = Hencke| first = David| title = Private Finance Hospital 'Putting Lives At Risk'| newspaper = The Guardian| date = 17 June 2005| url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jun/17/publicservices.politics| location=London}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, the building of two new PFI Police Stations on behalf of Kent Police serving the Medway area and the North Kent area (Gravesend and Dartford) is credited as a successful PFI project. Supporters say that the new buildings take into account the modern needs of the police better than the 60s/70s building, and that another advantage is that the old buildings can be sold for income or redeveloped into the police estate.<ref name=\"Flagship Police HQ Formally Open\">{{cite news  | title = Flagship Police HQ Formally Open | publisher = BBC   | date = 28 May 2008  | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/7424254.stm  | accessdate = }}</ref>\n\n====National Health Service (NHS)====\nIn 2017 there were 127 PFI schemes in the [[English NHS]]. The contracts vary greatly in size. Most include the cost of running services such as facilities management, hospital portering and patient food, and these amount to around 40% of the cost. Total repayments will cost around \u00a32.1 billion in 2017 and will reach a peak in 2029.

The PFI hospitals also have higher cleanliness scores than non-PFI hospitals of similar age, according to data collected by the NHS.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/health/article7128092.ece|accessdate=2011-05-09|title=PFI-funded hospitals outshine peers in study of cleanliness - Times Online|date=2011-05-09|location=London|work=The Times|first=Angela|last=Jameson}}</ref>\n\n[[Jonathan Fielden]], chair of the [[British Medical Association]]'s consultants' committee has said that PFI debts are \"distorting clinical priorities\" and affecting the treatment given to patients. Fielden cited the example of [[University Hospital Coventry]] where the NHS Trust was forced to borrow money to make the first \u00a354m payment owed to the PFI contractor. He said that the trust was in the ignominious position of struggling for money before the hospital's doors even opened. The trust could not afford to run all the services that it had commissioned and was having to mothball services and close wards.<ref name=\"phpc\"/>\n\n[[File:University hospital coventry1 5u07.JPG|thumb|right|250px|University Hospital Coventry]]\nThe high cost of hospitals built under PFI is forcing service cuts at neighbouring hospitals built with public money.

The paper attributed the debts in part to their high fixed PFI costs and suggested that the same would soon apply to Lewisham Hospital.\n\nIn 2012, seven NHS trusts were unable to meet the repayments for their private finance schemes and were given \u00a31.5 billion in emergency funding, to help them avoid cutting patient services.<ref>{{cite news|title=NHS trusts struggling with PFI debts to get help|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/28/nhs-trusts-pfi-debts-help|accessdate=5 October 2014|newspaper=Guardian|date=28 August 2012}}</ref>\n* [[Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust]]\n* [[Dartford and Gravesham NHS Trust]]\n* [[Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust]]\n* [[North Cumbria University Hospitals NHS Trust]]\n* [[Peterborough and Stamford Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust]]\n* [[St Helens and Knowsley Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust]]\n* [[South London Healthcare NHS Trust]]\n\nPeter Dixon, Chairman of [[University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust]], with the largest PFI-built hospital in England, has gone on the record to say:\n\n{{quote|We now have indexed payments for the next 35 years which at a time of growing concern over NHS budgets can only be a millstone.

In many cases this results in worse terms of employment and pension rights.

This [[finance|fiscal]] technicality can be convenient for governments. In his paper on PFI in Spain, Jos\u00e9 Francisco Bellod Redondo notes that one of the main drivers for PFI in Spain is [[Compliance (regulation)|compliance]] with the fiscal restrictions imposed under the [[Maastricht Treaty]] and [[Stability and Growth Pact]], which set concrete limits to the national debt.<ref>{{Citation\n |last      = Bellod Redondo\n |first     = Jos\u00e9 Francisco\n |title     = Financiaci\u00f3n privada de infraestructuras: El caso de la Autov\u00eda del Noroeste\n |publisher = Instituto de Estudios Fiscales\n |date      = November 2006\n |url       = http://www.ief.es/Publicaciones/revistas/PGP/44_Autovia.pdf\n}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn the UK, the technical reason why PFI debts are off-balance-sheet is that the government authority taking out the PFI theoretically transfers one or more of the following risks to the private sector: risk associated with demand for the facility (e.g. under-utilisation); risk associated with construction of the facility (e.g. overspend and delay); or risk associated with the 'availability' of the facility. The PFI contract bundles the payment to the private sector as a single ('unitary') charge for both the initial capital spend and the ongoing maintenance and operation costs. Because of supposed risk transfer, the entire contract is deemed to be revenue rather than capital spending. As a result, no capital spend appears on the government's balance sheet (the revenue expenditure would not have been on the government balance sheet in any event). Public accounting standards are being changed to bring these numbers back onto the balance sheet.<ref name=Economist1/> For example, in 2007 Neil Bentley, the [[Confederation of British Industry|CBI]]'s Director of Public Services, told a conference that the CBI was keen for the government to press ahead with accounting rule changes that would put large numbers of PFI projects onto the government's books. He was concerned that accusations of \"accounting tricks\" were delaying PFI projects.<ref>{{Citation  | last=Timmins  | first=Nicholas  | title=Treasury to ensure taxpayer is not the loser in PFI deals  | newspaper=Financial Times  | date=17 October 2008  | url=http://www.ft.com}}</ref>\n\n====Risk====\nSupporters of PFI claim that risk is successfully transferred from public to private sectors as a result of PFI, and that the private sector is better at [[risk management]]. As an example of successful risk transfer they cite the case of the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|National Physical Laboratory]]. This deal ultimately caused the collapse of the building contractor Laser (a [[joint venture]] between [[Serco]] and [[John Laing plc|John Laing]]) when the cost of the complex scientific laboratory, which was ultimately built, was very much larger than estimated.<ref name=\"tcnp\"/>\n\nOn the other hand, Allyson Pollock argues that in many PFI projects risks are not in fact transferred to the private sector<ref name=\"Pollock 2005 3\"/> and, based on the research findings of Pollock and others, George Monbiot argues<ref name=\"bwry\"/> that the calculation of risk in PFI projects is highly subjective, and is skewed to favour the private sector:\n\n{{quote|When private companies take on a PFI project, they are deemed to acquire risks the state would otherwise have carried.

The committee said it was \"a very serious blow indeed\" for the government's own tax-collecting services to have entered into the contract with Mapeley, whom they described as \"tax avoiders\". Conservative MP [[Edward Leigh]] said there were \"significant weaknesses\" in the way the contract was negotiated. The government agencies had failed to clarify Mapeley's tax plans until a late stage in the negotiations.

The NAO criticised the MoD for failing to carry out a \"sound evaluation of alternative procurement routes\" because there had been the \"assumption\" in the ministry that the aircraft must be provided through a PFI deal in order to keep the numbers off the balance sheet, due to \"affordability pressures and the prevailing policy to use PFI wherever possible\".<ref name='Norton-Taylor 2010'>{{Citation\n  | last = Norton-Taylor\n  | first = Richard\n  | title = Audit office slams MoD's PFI nightmare\n  | publisher = The Guardian\n  | date = 30 March 2010\n  | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/6647783.stm\n  | accessdate = 23 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n====Complexity====\nCritics claim that the complexity of many PFI projects is a barrier to accountability.

The TTF initially consisted of a policy arm staffed by five civil servants, and a projects section employing eight private sector executives led by [[Adrian Montague]], formally co-head of Global Project Finance at [[investment bank]] Dresdner Kleinwort Benson. In 1999 the policy arm was moved to the [[Office of Government Commerce]] (OGC), but it was subsequently moved back to the Treasury. The projects section was part-privatised and became [[Partnerships UK]] (PUK). The Treasury retained a 49% '[[golden share]]', while the majority stake in PUK was owned by private sector investors. PUK was then staffed almost entirely by private sector procurement specialists such as corporate lawyers, [[investment banking|investment bankers]], consultants and so forth.

It provides reports on the value for money of many PFI transactions and makes recommendations. The [[Public Accounts Committee (United Kingdom)|Public Accounts Committee]] also provides reports on these issues at a UK-wide level. The [[devolution|devolved]] governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have their own equivalents of the NAO such as the Wales Audit Office and the Northern Ireland Audit Office which review PFI projects in their respective localities. In recent years the Finance Committees of the [[Scottish Parliament]] and the [[National Assembly for Wales]] have held enquiries into whether PFI represents good value for money.\n\n====Local government====\nPFI is used in both central and local government. In the case of local government projects, the [[Capital (economics)|capital]] element of the funding which enables the [[local authority]] to pay the private sector for these projects is given by central government in the form of what are known as PFI \"credits\". The local authority then selects a private company to perform the work, and transfers detailed control of the project, and in theory the [[risk]], to the company.\n\n====Appraisal process====\n[[Jeremy Colman]], former deputy general of the [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] and [[Auditor General for Wales]] is quoted in the [[Financial Times]] saying that many PFI appraisals suffer from \"spurious precision\" and others are based on \"pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo\". Some, he says, are simply \"utter rubbish\". He noted government pressures on contracting authorities to weight their appraisals in favour of taking their projects down the PFI route: \"If the answer comes out wrong you don't get your project. So the answer doesn't come out wrong very often.\"<ref>{{Citation| last = Timmins| first = N.| title = Warning of 'Spurious' Figures on Value of PFI| newspaper = The Financial Times| date = 5 June 2002| url = http://www.ft.com}}</ref>\n\nIn a paper published in the [[British Medical Journal]], the magazine of the medical trade union, the BMA, a team consisting of two [[public health]] specialists and an economist concluded that many PFI appraisals do not correctly calculate the true risks involved. They argued that the appraisal system is highly subjective in its evaluation of risk transferral to the private sector. An example was an NHS project where the risk that clinical cost savings might not be achieved was theoretically transferred to the private sector. In the appraisal this risk was valued at \u00a35m but in practice the private contractor had no responsibility for ensuring clinical cost-savings and faced no penalty if there were none. Therefore, the supposed risk transfer was in fact spurious.<ref>{{Citation| last1 = Gaffney  | first1 = D.| last2 = Pollock | first2 = Allyson M.| last3 = Price | first3 = D.| last4 = Shaoul | first4 = J.| title = PFI in the NHS: is there an economic case?| journal = British Medical Journal| volume = 319| issue =7202| pages =116\u20139| year = 1999| doi = 10.1136/bmj.319.7202.116| pmid = 10398642| pmc = 1116198| url =| issn = }}</ref>\n\n==Development in other countries==\n[[File:Ciutat justicia 5.jpg|thumb|right|[[:es:Ciutat de la Justicia|Ciutat de la Justicia]], [[Barcelona]]]]\nAs well as the UK, PFI has also been adopted, under various guises, in many other countries including: [[Australia]], [[Canada]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Greece]], [[India]],  [[Ireland]], [[Israel]], [[Japan]], [[Malaysia]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Portugal]], [[Singapore]], [[Spain]] and the [[United States]].\n\n===Spain===\nExamples of PFI projects in Spain include [[:es:Parque de Valdebebas|Parque de Valdebebas]] in Madrid, [[:es:Ciutat de la Justicia|Ciutat de la Justicia]] in Barcelona, the [[:es:Transporte en la Regi\u00f3n de Murcia|Autovia de Noroeste]] in Murcia, and the Hospital Puerta de Hierro in Majadahonda.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.madrid.org/cs/Satellite?pagename=HospitalPuertaHierroMaja/Page/HPHM_home|title=Hospital Puerta de Hierro in Majadahonda|accessdate=30 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Government procurement]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n{{Refbegin}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n* House of Commons Library research paper on PFI (2001) [https://web.archive.org/web/20091007205715/http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/rp2001/rp01-117.pdf]\n* Northern Ireland Audit Office report (2004) into PFI in the health sector [https://web.archive.org/web/20040818035228/http://www.niauditoffice.gov.uk/pubs/onereport.asp?arc=False&id=144&dm=0&dy=0].\n* {{Citation\n  | first = Mark\n  | last = Hellowell\n  | first2 = Allyson M.\n  | last2 = Pollock\n  | authorlink2=Allyson Pollock\n  | title = The PFI: Scotland's Plan for Expansion and its Implications\n  | year = 2007\n  | publisher = University of Edinburgh\n  | url = http://www.sps.ed.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/64354/scotland_implications.pdf}}\n* Jane Broadbent, 2004.

Applied in the case of software, code written independently and distinctly different but producing the same results for the same inputs.\n[[Structures]] are usually designed with redundant parts as well, ensuring that if one part fails, the entire structure will not collapse. A structure without redundancy is called [[Fracture critical|fracture-critical]], meaning that a single broken component can cause the collapse of the entire structure. Bridges that failed due to lack of redundancy include the [[Silver Bridge]] and the [[Skagit River Bridge|Interstate 5 bridge over the Skagit River]].\n\n[[File:Series-Parallel-Systems-Examples.jpg|thumb|Series (A) and parallel (B) systems and their combination (C).<ref>Kokcharov I. Structural Safety http://www.kokch.kts.ru/me/t6/SIA_6_Structural_Safety.pdf</ref>]]\n\nParallel and combined systems demonstrate different level of redundancy. The models are subject of studies in reliability and safety engineering.\n\n== Function of redundancy ==\nThe two functions of redundancy are passive redundancy and [[active redundancy]]. Both functions prevent performance decline from exceeding specification limits without human intervention using extra capacity.\n\nPassive redundancy uses excess capacity to reduce the impact of component failures. One common form of passive redundancy is the extra strength of cabling and struts used in bridges. This extra strength allows some structural components to fail without bridge collapse. The extra strength used in the design is called the margin of safety.\n\nEyes and ears provide working examples of passive redundancy. Vision loss in one eye does not cause blindness but [[depth perception]] is impaired. Hearing loss in one ear does not cause deafness but directionality is lost. Performance decline is commonly associated with passive redundancy when a limited number of failures occur.\n\nActive redundancy eliminates performance declines by monitoring the performance of individual devices, and this monitoring is used in voting logic. The voting logic is linked to switching that automatically reconfigures the components. Error detection and correction and the Global Positioning System (GPS) are two examples of active redundancy.\n\n[[Electrical power distribution]] provides an example of active redundancy. Several power lines connect each generation facility with customers. Each power line includes monitors that detect overload. Each power line also includes circuit breakers. The combination of power lines provides excess capacity. Circuit breakers disconnect a power line when monitors detect an overload. Power is redistributed across the remaining lines.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==Disadvantages==\n[[Charles Perrow]], author of ''[[Normal Accidents]]'', has said that sometimes redundancies backfire and produce less, not more reliability. This may happen in three ways: First, redundant safety devices result in a more complex system, more prone to errors and accidents. Second, redundancy may lead to shirking of responsibility among workers. Third, redundancy may lead to increased production pressures, resulting in a system that operates at higher speeds, but less safely.<ref name=perr2004/>\n\n== Voting logic ==\nVoting logic uses performance monitoring to determine how to reconfigure individual components so that operation continues without violating specification limitations of the overall system. Voting logic often involves computers, but systems composed of items other than computers may be reconfigured using voting logic. Circuit breakers are an example of a form of non-computer voting logic.\n\nElectrical power systems use [[power scheduling]] to reconfigure active redundancy. Computing systems adjust the production output of each generating facility when other generating facilities are suddenly lost. This prevents blackout conditions during major events such as an earthquake.\n\nThe simplest voting logic in computing systems involves two components: primary and alternate. They both run similar software, but the output from the alternate remains inactive during normal operation. The primary monitors itself and periodically sends an activity message to the alternate as long as everything is OK. All outputs from the primary stop, including the activity message, when the primary detects a fault. The alternate activates its output and takes over from the primary after a brief delay when the activity message ceases. Errors in voting logic can cause both outputs to be active or inactive at the same time, or cause outputs to flutter on and off.\n\nA more reliable form of voting logic involves an odd number of three devices or more. All perform identical functions and the outputs are compared by the voting logic. The voting logic establishes a majority when there is a disagreement, and the majority will act to deactivate the output from other device(s) that disagree. A single fault will not interrupt normal operation. This technique is used with [[avionics]] systems, such as those responsible for operation of the [[Space Shuttle]].\n\n== Calculating the probability of system failure ==\nEach duplicate component added to the system decreases the probability of system failure according to the formula:-\n\n:<math>{p}=  \\prod_{i=1}^{n} p_{i} </math>\nwhere:\n* <math>n</math> \u2013 number of components\n* <math> p_{i} </math> \u2013 probability of component i failing\n* <math>p</math> \u2013 the probability of all components failing (system failure)\n\nThis formula assumes independence of failure events. That means that the probability of a component B failing given that a component A has already failed is the same as that of B failing when A has not failed. There are situations where this is unreasonable, such as using two [[Power supply unit (computer)|power supplies]] connected to the same socket in such a way that if one [[power supply]] failed, the other would too.\n\nIt also assumes that only one component is needed to keep the system running.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[degeneracy (biology)|Degeneracy]]\n* [[Common mode failure]]\n* [[Data redundancy]]\n* [[Double switching]]\n* [[Fault-tolerant design]]\n* [[Radiation hardening]]\n* [[Factor of safety]]\n* [[Reliability engineering]]\n* [[Reliability theory of aging and longevity]]\n* [[Safety engineering]]\n* [[Reliability (computer networking)]]\n* [[MTBF]]\n* [[N+1 redundancy]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.eu-sparc.net Secure Propulsion using Advanced Redundant Control]\n* [https://yamar.com/articles/The-Vehicle-Power-Line-as-a-Redundant-Channel-for-CAN-Communication.pdf Using powerline as a redundant communication channel]\n* {{cite journal|title= A new modeling approach to the safety evaluation of N-modular redundant computer systems in presence of imperfect maintenance|journal= Reliability Engineering & System Safety|volume= 94|issue= 9|pages= 1422\u20131432|doi= 10.1016/j.ress.2009.02.014|year= 2009|last1= Flammini|first1= Francesco|last2= Marrone|first2= Stefano|last3= Mazzocca|first3= Nicola|last4= Vittorini|first4= Valeria|arxiv= 1304.6656}}\n\n{{Occupational safety and health}}\n{{Underwater diving}}\n\n[[Category:Engineering concepts]]\n[[Category:Reliability engineering]]\n[[Category:Safety]]\n[[Category:Fault tolerance]]\n[[Category:Fault-tolerant computer systems]]\n\n[[pl:Redundancja#In\u017cynieria]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Duplication of critical components to increase reliability of a system }}\n{{Other uses|Redundancy (disambiguation){{!}}Redundancy}}\n{{refimprove|date=February 2014}}\n\n[[File:PC-Netzteil (redundant).jpg|thumb|Redundant power supply]]\n[[File:Reliability block diagram.png|thumb|Redundant subsystem \"B\"]]\n\nIn [[engineering]], '''redundancy''' is the duplication of critical [[wikt:component|component]]s or functions of a system with the intention of increasing reliability of the [[system]], usually in the form of a backup or [[fail-safe]], or to improve actual system performance, such as in the case of [[GNSS]] receivers, or [[multi-threaded]] computer processing.\n\nIn many [[safety-critical system]]s, such as [[fly-by-wire]] and [[hydraulic]] systems in [[aircraft]], some parts of the control system may be triplicated,<ref>[http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/rd/201/ibmrd2001E.pdf Redundancy Management Technique for Space Shuttle Computers] (PDF), IBM Research</ref> which is formally termed [[triple modular redundancy]] (TMR).

The approach and landing, in a northeasterly direction, offer the flying passengers a spectacular aerial view of Pontikonisi and Vlaherna Monastery as well as the hills of Kanoni as the runway used for landing is actually a few hundred metres away from these landmarks.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Terminaloncorfuairport.jpg|thumb|right|Check-in at Corfu Airport]]\n[[File:OK-TVK.jpg|thumb|right|[[Travel Service Airlines]] [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737-800]] at Corfu International Airport]]\nThe airport was founded in 1937. During [[World War II|Second World War]] it was used by German and Italian forces as a base for transport and fighter aircraft.\nDuring the war the runway length was 600m. By the end of April 1949 the length had reached 800m. A further extension to 1260m took place by the end of 1951 to meet the then larger aircraft needs. The next and last extension of the runway began in 1957 and was completed in 1959, with a length of 2,373m.\nThe first commercial flight took place on 19 April 1949 from [[Athens]] operated by [[TAE Greek National Airlines]]. On 2 September 1950 HELLAS also started flights to Corfu.\nIn 1962 a small passenger terminal was built, which today accommodates the Corfu Aeroclub. In April 1965 the airport became International, with the inaugural overseas flight being operated by [[Olympic Airlines]]. The construction of the new passenger terminal began in 1968 and was completed in 1972.<ref>[http://www.corfu-airport.com/corfu-airport-history.html Corfu Airport History]. http://www.corfu-airport.com.

They include the remodeling and expansion of the current terminal as well as the construction of a new one. A Hold Baggage inline Screening System (HBS) will improve safety and efficiency, along with the refurbishment of the airport fire service, which will benefit from the reorganization of the airport apron area including the replacement of paving in this area. Also planned is the increase of the number of check-in desks from 22 to 28, the number of departure gates to 12, as well as reorganisation of the security check lanes in the terminal.\n\n==Airlines

The approach and landing, in a northeasterly direction, offer the flying passengers a spectacular aerial view of Pontikonisi and Vlaherna Monastery as well as the hills of Kanoni as the runway used for landing is actually a few hundred metres away from these landmarks.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Terminaloncorfuairport.jpg|thumb|right|Check-in at Corfu Airport]]\n[[File:OK-TVK.jpg|thumb|right|[[Travel Service Airlines]] [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737-800]] at Corfu International Airport]]\nThe airport was founded in 1937. During [[World War II|Second World War]] it was used by German and Italian forces as a base for transport and fighter aircraft.\nDuring the war the runway length was 600m. By the end of April 1949 the length had reached 800m. A further extension to 1260m took place by the end of 1951 to meet the then larger aircraft needs. The next and last extension of the runway began in 1957 and was completed in 1959, with a length of 2,373m.\nThe first commercial flight took place on 19 April 1949 from [[Athens]] operated by [[TAE Greek National Airlines]]. On 2 September 1950 HELLAS also started flights to Corfu.\nIn 1962 a small passenger terminal was built, which today accommodates the Corfu Aeroclub. In April 1965 the airport became International, with the inaugural overseas flight being operated by [[Olympic Airlines]]. The construction of the new passenger terminal began in 1968 and was completed in 1972.<ref>[http://www.corfu-airport.com/corfu-airport-history.html Corfu Airport History]. http://www.corfu-airport.com.

They include the remodeling and expansion of the current terminal as well as the construction of a new one. A Hold Baggage inline Screening System (HBS) will improve safety and efficiency, along with the refurbishment of the airport fire service, which will benefit from the reorganization of the airport apron area including the replacement of paving in this area. Also planned is the increase of the number of check-in desks from 22 to 28, the number of departure gates to 12, as well as reorganisation of the security check lanes in the terminal.\n\n==Airlines

Born in [[Brussels]] as the second but eldest surviving son of [[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold I]] and [[Louise of Orl\u00e9ans]], he succeeded his father to the Belgian throne in 1865 and reigned for 44 years until his death \u2013 the longest reign of any Belgian monarch. He died without surviving sons. The current Belgian king descends from his nephew and successor, [[Albert I of Belgium|Albert I]].\n\nLeopold was the founder and sole owner of the [[Congo Free State]], a private project undertaken on his own behalf. He used [[Henry Morton Stanley]] to help him lay claim to the Congo, the present-day [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. At the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884\u20131885, the colonial nations of Europe authorized his claim by committing the Congo Free State to improving the lives of the native inhabitants. Leopold ignored these conditions and ran the Congo using the mercenary [[Force Publique]] for his personal gain. He extracted a fortune from the territory, initially by the collection of [[ivory]], and after a rise in the price of [[rubber]] in the 1890s, by forced labour from the native population to harvest and process rubber. He used great sums of the money from this exploitation for public and private construction projects in Belgium during this period. He donated the private buildings to the state before his death, to preserve them for Belgium.\n\nLeopold's administration of the Congo was characterised by murder, torture, and [[Atrocities in the Congo Free State|atrocities]], resulting from notorious systematic brutality. The hands of men, women, and children were amputated when the quota of rubber was not met. These and other facts were established at the time by eyewitness testimony and on-site inspection by an international Commission of Inquiry (1904). Millions of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] people died: modern estimates range from 1 million to 15 million deaths, with a consensus growing around 10 million. Some historians argue against this figure, citing the absence of reliable censuses, the enormous mortality of diseases such as [[smallpox]] or [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], and the fact that there were only 175 administrative agents in charge of [[rubber]] exploitation.<ref>{{Cite web |title=CRITIQUE DU LIVRE DE HOCHSCHILD |url=http://www.urome.be/fr2/ouvrag/hochschild.pdf |author= Jean Stengers|language=French}}</ref><ref name=\"Sophie Mignon\">{{Cite web |title=Non, L\u00e9opold II n'est pas un g\u00e9nocidaire!|url=http://www.lalibre.be/debats/opinions/non-leopold-ii-n-est-pas-un-genocidaire-567922033570ed3894b6608a |author= Sophie Mignon|language=french}}</ref>  In 1908, the reports of deaths and abuse induced the Belgian government to take over the administration of the Congo from Leopold.\n\n==Early life==\nLeopold was born in [[Brussels]] on 9 April 1835, the second child of the reigning Belgian monarch, [[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold I]], and of his second wife, [[Louise of Orl\u00e9ans|Louise]], the daughter of [[Louis Philippe I|King Louis Philippe]] of [[France]]. The [[French Revolution of 1848]] forced Louis Philippe to flee to the [[United Kingdom]]. The British monarch, [[Queen Victoria]], was Leopold II's first cousin, as Leopold's father and Victoria's mother were siblings. Louis Philippe died two years later, in 1850. Leopold's fragile mother was deeply affected by the death of her father, and her health deteriorated. She died of [[tuberculosis]] that same year, when Leopold was 15 years old.\n\n==Marriage and family==\n[[File:Leopold of Belgium, Duke of Brabant; Nicaise de Keyser.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Leopold as a younger man in the uniform of the [[Grenadier]]s (Portrait by [[Nicaise de Keyser]])]]\n\nOn 22 August 1853, at the age of 18, he married [[Marie Henriette of Austria]] in Brussels. Marie Henriette was a cousin of Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] and granddaughter of [[Emperor Leopold II]]. Marie Henriette was lively and energetic, and endeared herself to the people by her character and benevolence, and her beauty gained for her the [[sobriquet]] of \"The Rose of Brabant\". She was also an accomplished artist and musician.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Leopold II., King of the Belgians|volume=16|page=461}}</ref> She was passionate about [[horseback riding]] to the point that she would care for her horses personally. Some joked about this \"marriage of a [[hostler|stableman]] and a [[nun]]\",<ref>{{in lang|fr}} \u00ab mariage d'un palefrenier et d'une religieuse \u00bb</ref> the shy and withdrawn Leopold referred to as the nun.\n\nFour children were born of this marriage, three daughters and one son, also named [[Prince Leopold, Duke of Brabant|Leopold]]. The younger Leopold died in 1869 at the age of nine from [[pneumonia]] after falling into a pond. His death was a source of great sorrow for King Leopold. The marriage became unhappy, and the couple separated completely after a last attempt to have another son, a union that resulted in the birth of their last daughter Clementine. Marie Henriette retreated to [[Spa, Belgium|Spa]] in 1895, and died there in 1902.<ref name=monarchie/>\n\n[[File:Your Majesty! at your age....jpg|thumb|A [[political cartoon]] pillorying Leopold's love affair with Caroline Lacroix. <br />\n'''''The Abbot:''''' Oh! Sire, at your age?<br />\n'''''The King:''''' You should try it for yourself!]]\n\nLeopold had many mistresses. In 1899, in his sixty-fifth year, Leopold took as a mistress [[Caroline Lacroix]], a sixteen-year-old French prostitute, and they remained together for the next decade until his death. Leopold lavished upon her large sums of money, estates, gifts, and a noble title, Baroness Vaughan. Owing to these gifts and the unofficial nature of their relationship, Caroline was deeply unpopular among the Belgian people and internationally. She and Leopold married secretly in a religious ceremony five days before his death. Their failure to perform a [[civil ceremony]] rendered the marriage invalid under Belgian law. After the king's death, it was soon discovered that he had left Caroline a large fortune, which the Belgian government and Leopold's three estranged daughters tried to seize as rightfully theirs. Caroline bore two sons who were probably Leopold's; the boys would have had a strong claim to the throne had the marriage been valid.\n\n==Early political career==\n[[File:Leopold Louis Philippe Marie Victor (1835-1909); kroonprins en hertog van Brabant, later koning Leopold II der Belgen, Granzella, Felixarchief, 12 12732.jpg|thumb|Leopold Louis Philippe Marie Victor (1835-1909); crown prince and duke of Brabant, later King Leopold II of the Belgians, Granzella, collection Felixarchief]]\nAs Leopold's older brother, also named [[Louis Philippe, Crown Prince of Belgium|Louis Philippe]], had died the year before Leopold's birth, Leopold was heir to the throne from his birth. When he was 9 years old, Leopold received the title of [[Duke of Brabant]], and was appointed a sub-lieutenant in [[Belgian Armed Forces|the army]]. He served in the army until his accession in 1865, by which time he had reached the rank of lieutenant-general.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nLeopold's public career began on his attaining the age of majority in 1855, when he became a member of the [[Senate (Belgium)|Belgian Senate]]. He took an active interest in the senate, especially in matters concerning the development of Belgium and its trade,<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> and began to urge Belgium's acquisition of colonies. Leopold traveled extensively abroad from 1854 to 1865, visiting [[India]], [[China]], [[Egypt]], and the countries on the [[Mediterranean]] coast of [[Africa]]. His father died on December 10, 1865, and Leopold took the oath of office on December 17, in his thirtieth year.<ref name=monarchie>{{cite web|title=Leopold II|url=http://www.monarchie.be/history/leopold-ii|publisher=[[Monarchy of Belgium|The Belgian Monarchy]]|accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Domestic reign==\n[[File:Prestation de serment de L\u00e9opold II le 17 d\u00e9cembre 1865.jpg|thumb|upright|Leopold II at his accession to the throne]]\nLeopold became king in 1865. He explained his goal for his reign in an 1888 letter addressed to his brother, [[Prince Philippe, Count of Flanders]]: \"the country must be strong, prosperous, therefore have colonies of her own, beautiful and calm.\"<ref>{{in lang|fr}} \u00ab la patrie doit \u00eatre forte, prosp\u00e8re, par cons\u00e9quent poss\u00e9der des d\u00e9bouch\u00e9s \u00e0 elle, belle et calme. \u00bb ''The King to the Count of Flanders'', January 26, 1888; The Count of Flanders's papers.</ref>\n\nLeopold's reign was marked by a number of major political developments. The [[Liberal Party (Belgium)|Liberals]] governed Belgium from 1857 to 1880, and during its final year in power legislated the [[Walth\u00e8re Fr\u00e8re-Orban|Fr\u00e8re-Orban]] Law of 1879. This law created free, secular, compulsory primary schools supported by the state and withdrew all state support from [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] primary schools. The [[Catholic Party (Belgium)|Catholic Party]] obtained a parliamentary majority in 1880, and four years later restored state support to Catholic schools. In 1885, various socialist and social democratic groups drew together and formed the [[Belgian Labour Party|Labour Party]]. Increasing social unrest and the rise of the Labour Party forced the adoption of universal male [[suffrage]] in 1893.\n\nDuring Leopold's reign other social changes were enacted into law. Among these were the right of workers to form [[labour union]]s and the abolition of the ''livret d'ouvrier'', an [[employment record book]]. Laws against child labour were passed. Children younger than 12 were not allowed to work in factories, children younger than 16 were not allowed to work at night, and women younger than 21 years old were not allowed to work underground. Workers gained the right to be compensated for workplace accidents, and were given Sundays off.\n\nThe first revision of the [[Belgian constitution]] came in 1893. [[Universal male suffrage]] was introduced, though the effect of this was tempered by [[plural voting]]. The eligibility requirements for [[senate (Belgium)|the senate]] were reduced, and elections would be based on a system of [[proportional representation]], which continues to this day. Leopold pushed strongly to pass a royal referendum, whereby the king would have the power to consult the electorate directly on an issue, and use his [[veto]] according to the results of the referendum. The proposal was rejected, as it would have given the king the power to override the elected [[government]]. Leopold was so disappointed that he considered [[abdication]].<ref>{{cite book |first1=Jean |last1=Stengers |title=L'action du Roi en Belgique depuis 1831: pouvoir et influence |trans-title=The action of the King in Belgium since 1831: power and influence |language=French |edition=3rd |publisher=Racine |location=Brussels |year=2008 |pages=123\u20134 |isbn=978-2-87386-567-2}}</ref>\n\nLeopold emphasized military defence as the basis of neutrality, and strove to make Belgium less vulnerable militarily. He achieved the construction of defensive fortresses [[Fortified Position of Li\u00e8ge|at Li\u00e8ge]], [[Fortified Position of Namur|at Namur]] and [[National redoubt of Belgium|at Antwerp]]. During the [[Franco-Prussian War]], he managed to preserve Belgium's neutrality in a period of unusual difficulty and danger.<ref name=\"EB1911\" /> Leopold pushed for a reform in military service, but he was unable to obtain one until he was on his deathbed. Under the old system of ''[[Remplacement]]'', the Belgian army was a combination of volunteers and a lottery, and it was possible for men to pay for substitutes for service. This was replaced by a system in which one son in every family would have to serve in the military.\n\n===Builder King===\n[[File:Brussels Cinquantenaire R02.jpg|thumb|left|The [[triumphal arch]] of the ''[[Cinquantenaire]]'' complex in [[Brussels]]]]\n\nLeopold commissioned a great number of buildings, urban projects and public works, largely with the profits generated from exploitation of natural resources and the population of the [[Congo Free State|Congo]]. These projects earned him the epithet of \"Builder King\" (''Koning-Bouwheer'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], ''le Roi-B\u00e2tisseur'' in [[French language|French]]). The public buildings were mainly in [[Brussels]], [[Ostend]] and [[Antwerp]], and include the [[Hippodrome Wellington]] racetrack, the [[Royal Galleries of Ostend|Royal Galleries]] and Maria Hendrikapark in [[Ostend]]; the [[Royal Museum for Central Africa]] and its surrounding park in [[Tervuren]]; the ''[[Cinquantenaire]]'' park, triumphal arch and complex, and the [[Duden Park]] in Brussels, and the 1895-1905 [[Antwerpen-Centraal railway station]].\n\nIn addition to his public works, he acquired and built numerous private properties for himself inside and outside Belgium. He expanded the grounds of the [[Royal Castle of Laeken]], and built the [[Royal Greenhouses of Laeken|Royal Greenhouses]], the Japanese Tower and the Chinese Pavilion near the palace. In the [[Ardennes]], his domains consisted of {{convert|6700|ha|-3}} of forests and agricultural lands and the [[ch\u00e2teaux]] of [[Ch\u00e2teau royal d'Ardenne|Ardenne]], [[Ciergnon Castle|Ciergnon]], Fenffe, Villers-sur-Lesse and Ferage. He also built important [[country estate]]s on the [[French Riviera]], including the ''[[Jardin botanique \"Les C\u00e8dres\"|Villa des C\u00e8dres]]'' and its [[botanical garden]], and the [[Villa Leopolda]].\n\nThinking of the future after his death, Leopold did not want the collection of estates, lands and heritage buildings he had privately amassed to be scattered amongst his daughters, each of whom was married to a foreign prince. In 1900, he created the [[Royal Trust (Belgium)|Royal Trust]], by means of which he donated most of his property to the Belgian nation. This preserved them to beautify Belgium in perpetuity, while still allowing future generations of the Belgian Royal family the privilege of their use.\n\n===Attempted assassination===\nOn 15 November 1902, Italian [[anarchist]] [[Gennaro Rubino]] attempted to [[regicide|assassinate]] Leopold, who was riding in a royal cortege from a ceremony at Saint-Gudule Cathedral in memory of his recently deceased wife, [[Marie Henriette of Austria|Marie Henriette]]. After Leopold's carriage passed, Rubino fired three shots at the procession. The shots missed Leopold but almost killed the king's [[Grand Marshall]], Count Charles John d'Oultremont. Rubino was immediately arrested and subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment. He died in prison in 1918.\n\nThe king replied after the attack to a senator: \"My dear senator, if fate wants me shot, too bad!\" (\"Mon cher Senateur, si la fatalite veut que je sois atteint, tant pis\"!)<ref name=\"Meuse La 17-11-1902\">Meuse (La) 17-11-1902</ref>\nAfter the failed [[regicide]] the security of the king was questioned, because the glass of the landaus was 2&nbsp;cm thick. Elsewhere in Europe, the news of this assassination attempt was received with alarm. Heads of state and the pope sent telegrams to the king congratulating him for surviving the assassination attempt. Many people remembered the earlier assassinations of [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria]] and [[Umberto I of Italy|King Umberto I of Italy]] by other Italian anarchists.\n\nThe Belgians rejoiced that the king was safe. Later in the day, in the [[Theatre Royal de la Monnaie]] before ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' was performed, the orchestra played the [[Braban\u00e7onne]], which was sung loudly and ended with loud cheers and applause.<ref name=\"Meuse La 17-11-1902\"/>\n\n==Congo Free State==\n[[File:kongovrijstaat.jpg|thumb|Map of the Congo Free State, c. 1890]]\n\nLeopold was the founder and sole owner of the [[Congo Free State]] and all its people, a private project undertaken on his own behalf.<ref name=ewans>{{cite book|last1=Ewans|first1=Sir Martin|title=European Atrocity, African Catastrophe: Leopold II, the Congo Free State and its Aftermath|date=2017|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=Abingdon, England|doi=10.4324/9781315829173|isbn=9781317849070|language=en}}</ref>{{rp|136}} He used explorer [[Henry Morton Stanley]] to help him lay claim to the Congo, an area now known as the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].

At first, ivory was exported, but this did not yield the expected levels of revenue. When the global demand for rubber exploded, attention shifted to the labor-intensive collection of sap from rubber plants. Abandoning the promises of the [[Berlin Conference]] in the late 1890s, the Free State government restricted foreign access and extorted [[forced labor]] from the natives.

from 1865 to 1909.  Born in [[Brussels]] as the second but eldest surviving son of [[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold I]] and [[Louise of Orl\u00e9ans]], he succeeded his father to the Belgian throne in 1865 and reigned for 44 years until his death \u2013 the longest reign of any Belgian monarch. He died without surviving sons. The current Belgian king descends from his nephew and successor, [[Albert I of Belgium|Albert I]].\n\nLeopold was the founder and sole owner of the [[Congo Free State]], a private project undertaken on his own behalf. He used [[Henry Morton Stanley]] to help him lay claim to the Congo, the present-day [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. At the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884\u20131885, the colonial nations of Europe authorized his claim by committing the Congo Free State to improving the lives of the native inhabitants. Leopold ignored these conditions and ran the Congo using the mercenary [[Force Publique]] for his personal gain. He extracted a fortune from the territory, initially by the collection of [[ivory]], and after a rise in the price of [[rubber]] in the 1890s, by forced labour from the native population to harvest and process rubber. He used great sums of the money from this exploitation for public and private construction projects in Belgium during this period. He donated the private buildings to the state before his death, to preserve them for Belgium.\n\nLeopold's administration of the Congo was characterised by murder, torture, and [[Atrocities in the Congo Free State|atrocities]], resulting from notorious systematic brutality. The hands of men, women, and children were amputated when the quota of rubber was not met. These and other facts were established at the time by eyewitness testimony and on-site inspection by an international Commission of Inquiry (1904). Millions of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] people died: modern estimates range from 1 million to 15 million deaths, with a consensus growing around 10 million. Some historians argue against this figure, citing the absence of reliable censuses, the enormous mortality of diseases such as [[smallpox]] or [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], and the fact that there were only 175 administrative agents in charge of [[rubber]] exploitation.<ref>{{Cite web |title=CRITIQUE DU LIVRE DE HOCHSCHILD |url=http://www.urome.be/fr2/ouvrag/hochschild.pdf |author= Jean Stengers|language=French}}</ref><ref name=\"Sophie Mignon\">{{Cite web |title=Non, L\u00e9opold II n'est pas un g\u00e9nocidaire!|url=http://www.lalibre.be/debats/opinions/non-leopold-ii-n-est-pas-un-genocidaire-567922033570ed3894b6608a |author= Sophie Mignon|language=french}}</ref>  In 1908, the reports of deaths and abuse induced the Belgian government to take over the administration of the Congo from Leopold.\n\n==Early life==\nLeopold was born in [[Brussels]] on 9 April 1835, the second child of the reigning Belgian monarch, [[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold I]], and of his second wife, [[Louise of Orl\u00e9ans|Louise]], the daughter of [[Louis Philippe I|King Louis Philippe]] of [[France]]. The [[French Revolution of 1848]] forced Louis Philippe to flee to the [[United Kingdom]]. The British monarch, [[Queen Victoria]], was Leopold II's first cousin, as Leopold's father and Victoria's mother were siblings. Louis Philippe died two years later, in 1850. Leopold's fragile mother was deeply affected by the death of her father, and her health deteriorated. She died of [[tuberculosis]] that same year, when Leopold was 15 years old.\n\n==Marriage and family==\n[[File:Leopold of Belgium, Duke of Brabant; Nicaise de Keyser.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Leopold as a younger man in the uniform of the [[Grenadier]]s (Portrait by [[Nicaise de Keyser]])]]\n\nOn 22 August 1853, at the age of 18, he married [[Marie Henriette of Austria]] in Brussels. Marie Henriette was a cousin of Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] and granddaughter of [[Emperor Leopold II]]. Marie Henriette was lively and energetic, and endeared herself to the people by her character and benevolence, and her beauty gained for her the [[sobriquet]] of \"The Rose of Brabant\". She was also an accomplished artist and musician.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Leopold II., King of the Belgians|volume=16|page=461}}</ref> She was passionate about [[horseback riding]] to the point that she would care for her horses personally. Some joked about this \"marriage of a [[hostler|stableman]] and a [[nun]]\",<ref>{{in lang|fr}} \u00ab mariage d'un palefrenier et d'une religieuse \u00bb</ref> the shy and withdrawn Leopold referred to as the nun.\n\nFour children were born of this marriage, three daughters and one son, also named [[Prince Leopold, Duke of Brabant|Leopold]]. The younger Leopold died in 1869 at the age of nine from [[pneumonia]] after falling into a pond. His death was a source of great sorrow for King Leopold. The marriage became unhappy, and the couple separated completely after a last attempt to have another son, a union that resulted in the birth of their last daughter Clementine. Marie Henriette retreated to [[Spa, Belgium|Spa]] in 1895, and died there in 1902.<ref name=monarchie/>\n\n[[File:Your Majesty! at your age....jpg|thumb|A [[political cartoon]] pillorying Leopold's love affair with Caroline Lacroix. <br />\n'''''The Abbot:''''' Oh! Sire, at your age?<br />\n'''''The King:''''' You should try it for yourself!]]\n\nLeopold had many mistresses. In 1899, in his sixty-fifth year, Leopold took as a mistress [[Caroline Lacroix]], a sixteen-year-old French prostitute, and they remained together for the next decade until his death. Leopold lavished upon her large sums of money, estates, gifts, and a noble title, Baroness Vaughan. Owing to these gifts and the unofficial nature of their relationship, Caroline was deeply unpopular among the Belgian people and internationally. She and Leopold married secretly in a religious ceremony five days before his death. Their failure to perform a [[civil ceremony]] rendered the marriage invalid under Belgian law. After the king's death, it was soon discovered that he had left Caroline a large fortune, which the Belgian government and Leopold's three estranged daughters tried to seize as rightfully theirs. Caroline bore two sons who were probably Leopold's; the boys would have had a strong claim to the throne had the marriage been valid.\n\n==Early political career==\n[[File:Leopold Louis Philippe Marie Victor (1835-1909); kroonprins en hertog van Brabant, later koning Leopold II der Belgen, Granzella, Felixarchief, 12 12732.jpg|thumb|Leopold Louis Philippe Marie Victor (1835-1909); crown prince and duke of Brabant, later King Leopold II of the Belgians, Granzella, collection Felixarchief]]\nAs Leopold's older brother, also named [[Louis Philippe, Crown Prince of Belgium|Louis Philippe]], had died the year before Leopold's birth, Leopold was heir to the throne from his birth. When he was 9 years old, Leopold received the title of [[Duke of Brabant]], and was appointed a sub-lieutenant in [[Belgian Armed Forces|the army]]. He served in the army until his accession in 1865, by which time he had reached the rank of lieutenant-general.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nLeopold's public career began on his attaining the age of majority in 1855, when he became a member of the [[Senate (Belgium)|Belgian Senate]]. He took an active interest in the senate, especially in matters concerning the development of Belgium and its trade,<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> and began to urge Belgium's acquisition of colonies. Leopold traveled extensively abroad from 1854 to 1865, visiting [[India]], [[China]], [[Egypt]], and the countries on the [[Mediterranean]] coast of [[Africa]]. His father died on December 10, 1865, and Leopold took the oath of office on December 17, in his thirtieth year.<ref name=monarchie>{{cite web|title=Leopold II|url=http://www.monarchie.be/history/leopold-ii|publisher=[[Monarchy of Belgium|The Belgian Monarchy]]|accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Domestic reign==\n[[File:Prestation de serment de L\u00e9opold II le 17 d\u00e9cembre 1865.jpg|thumb|upright|Leopold II at his accession to the throne]]\nLeopold became king in 1865. He explained his goal for his reign in an 1888 letter addressed to his brother, [[Prince Philippe, Count of Flanders]]: \"the country must be strong, prosperous, therefore have colonies of her own, beautiful and calm.\"<ref>{{in lang|fr}} \u00ab la patrie doit \u00eatre forte, prosp\u00e8re, par cons\u00e9quent poss\u00e9der des d\u00e9bouch\u00e9s \u00e0 elle, belle et calme. \u00bb ''The King to the Count of Flanders'', January 26, 1888; The Count of Flanders's papers.</ref>\n\nLeopold's reign was marked by a number of major political developments. The [[Liberal Party (Belgium)|Liberals]] governed Belgium from 1857 to 1880, and during its final year in power legislated the [[Walth\u00e8re Fr\u00e8re-Orban|Fr\u00e8re-Orban]] Law of 1879. This law created free, secular, compulsory primary schools supported by the state and withdrew all state support from [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] primary schools. The [[Catholic Party (Belgium)|Catholic Party]] obtained a parliamentary majority in 1880, and four years later restored state support to Catholic schools. In 1885, various socialist and social democratic groups drew together and formed the [[Belgian Labour Party|Labour Party]]. Increasing social unrest and the rise of the Labour Party forced the adoption of universal male [[suffrage]] in 1893.\n\nDuring Leopold's reign other social changes were enacted into law. Among these were the right of workers to form [[labour union]]s and the abolition of the ''livret d'ouvrier'', an [[employment record book]]. Laws against child labour were passed. Children younger than 12 were not allowed to work in factories, children younger than 16 were not allowed to work at night, and women younger than 21 years old were not allowed to work underground. Workers gained the right to be compensated for workplace accidents, and were given Sundays off.\n\nThe first revision of the [[Belgian constitution]] came in 1893. [[Universal male suffrage]] was introduced, though the effect of this was tempered by [[plural voting]]. The eligibility requirements for [[senate (Belgium)|the senate]] were reduced, and elections would be based on a system of [[proportional representation]], which continues to this day. Leopold pushed strongly to pass a royal referendum, whereby the king would have the power to consult the electorate directly on an issue, and use his [[veto]] according to the results of the referendum. The proposal was rejected, as it would have given the king the power to override the elected [[government]]. Leopold was so disappointed that he considered [[abdication]].<ref>{{cite book |first1=Jean |last1=Stengers |title=L'action du Roi en Belgique depuis 1831: pouvoir et influence |trans-title=The action of the King in Belgium since 1831: power and influence |language=French |edition=3rd |publisher=Racine |location=Brussels |year=2008 |pages=123\u20134 |isbn=978-2-87386-567-2}}</ref>\n\nLeopold emphasized military defence as the basis of neutrality, and strove to make Belgium less vulnerable militarily. He achieved the construction of defensive fortresses [[Fortified Position of Li\u00e8ge|at Li\u00e8ge]], [[Fortified Position of Namur|at Namur]] and [[National redoubt of Belgium|at Antwerp]]. During the [[Franco-Prussian War]], he managed to preserve Belgium's neutrality in a period of unusual difficulty and danger.<ref name=\"EB1911\" /> Leopold pushed for a reform in military service, but he was unable to obtain one until he was on his deathbed. Under the old system of ''[[Remplacement]]'', the Belgian army was a combination of volunteers and a lottery, and it was possible for men to pay for substitutes for service. This was replaced by a system in which one son in every family would have to serve in the military.\n\n===Builder King===\n[[File:Brussels Cinquantenaire R02.jpg|thumb|left|The [[triumphal arch]] of the ''[[Cinquantenaire]]'' complex in [[Brussels]]]]\n\nLeopold commissioned a great number of buildings, urban projects and public works, largely with the profits generated from exploitation of natural resources and the population of the [[Congo Free State|Congo]]. These projects earned him the epithet of \"Builder King\" (''Koning-Bouwheer'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], ''le Roi-B\u00e2tisseur'' in [[French language|French]]). The public buildings were mainly in [[Brussels]], [[Ostend]] and [[Antwerp]], and include the [[Hippodrome Wellington]] racetrack, the [[Royal Galleries of Ostend|Royal Galleries]] and Maria Hendrikapark in [[Ostend]]; the [[Royal Museum for Central Africa]] and its surrounding park in [[Tervuren]]; the ''[[Cinquantenaire]]'' park, triumphal arch and complex, and the [[Duden Park]] in Brussels, and the 1895-1905 [[Antwerpen-Centraal railway station]].\n\nIn addition to his public works, he acquired and built numerous private properties for himself inside and outside Belgium. He expanded the grounds of the [[Royal Castle of Laeken]], and built the [[Royal Greenhouses of Laeken|Royal Greenhouses]], the Japanese Tower and the Chinese Pavilion near the palace. In the [[Ardennes]], his domains consisted of {{convert|6700|ha|-3}} of forests and agricultural lands and the [[ch\u00e2teaux]] of [[Ch\u00e2teau royal d'Ardenne|Ardenne]], [[Ciergnon Castle|Ciergnon]], Fenffe, Villers-sur-Lesse and Ferage. He also built important [[country estate]]s on the [[French Riviera]], including the ''[[Jardin botanique \"Les C\u00e8dres\"|Villa des C\u00e8dres]]'' and its [[botanical garden]], and the [[Villa Leopolda]].\n\nThinking of the future after his death, Leopold did not want the collection of estates, lands and heritage buildings he had privately amassed to be scattered amongst his daughters, each of whom was married to a foreign prince. In 1900, he created the [[Royal Trust (Belgium)|Royal Trust]], by means of which he donated most of his property to the Belgian nation. This preserved them to beautify Belgium in perpetuity, while still allowing future generations of the Belgian Royal family the privilege of their use.\n\n===Attempted assassination===\nOn 15 November 1902, Italian [[anarchist]] [[Gennaro Rubino]] attempted to [[regicide|assassinate]] Leopold, who was riding in a royal cortege from a ceremony at Saint-Gudule Cathedral in memory of his recently deceased wife, [[Marie Henriette of Austria|Marie Henriette]]. After Leopold's carriage passed, Rubino fired three shots at the procession. The shots missed Leopold but almost killed the king's [[Grand Marshall]], Count Charles John d'Oultremont. Rubino was immediately arrested and subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment. He died in prison in 1918.\n\nThe king replied after the attack to a senator: \"My dear senator, if fate wants me shot, too bad!\" (\"Mon cher Senateur, si la fatalite veut que je sois atteint, tant pis\"!)<ref name=\"Meuse La 17-11-1902\">Meuse (La) 17-11-1902</ref>\nAfter the failed [[regicide]] the security of the king was questioned, because the glass of the landaus was 2&nbsp;cm thick. Elsewhere in Europe, the news of this assassination attempt was received with alarm. Heads of state and the pope sent telegrams to the king congratulating him for surviving the assassination attempt. Many people remembered the earlier assassinations of [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria]] and [[Umberto I of Italy|King Umberto I of Italy]] by other Italian anarchists.\n\nThe Belgians rejoiced that the king was safe. Later in the day, in the [[Theatre Royal de la Monnaie]] before ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' was performed, the orchestra played the [[Braban\u00e7onne]], which was sung loudly and ended with loud cheers and applause.<ref name=\"Meuse La 17-11-1902\"/>\n\n==Congo Free State==\n[[File:kongovrijstaat.jpg|thumb|Map of the Congo Free State, c. 1890]]\n\nLeopold was the founder and sole owner of the [[Congo Free State]] and all its people, a private project undertaken on his own behalf.<ref name=ewans>{{cite book|last1=Ewans|first1=Sir Martin|title=European Atrocity, African Catastrophe: Leopold II, the Congo Free State and its Aftermath|date=2017|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=Abingdon, England|doi=10.4324/9781315829173|isbn=9781317849070|language=en}}</ref>{{rp|136}} He used explorer [[Henry Morton Stanley]] to help him lay claim to the Congo, an area now known as the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].

Leopold eventually began to acquire a colony as a private citizen. The Belgian government lent him money for this venture.\n\nIn 1866, Leopold instructed the Belgian ambassador in Madrid to speak to Queen [[Isabella II of Spain]] about ceding the [[Philippines]] to Belgium. Knowing the situation fully, the ambassador did nothing. Leopold quickly replaced the ambassador with a more sympathetic individual to carry out his plan.<ref name=\"Looking Back pp 54-57\">{{cite book|last=Ocampo|first=Ambeth|title=Looking Back|year=2009|publisher=[[Anvil Publishing]]|location=Mandaluyong, Philippines|isbn=978-971-27-2336-0|pages=54\u201357}}</ref> In 1868, when Isabella II was deposed as queen of Spain, Leopold tried to press his original plan to acquire the Philippines.

The expedition was composed of two columns: the first, under Belgian war hero [[Francis Dhanis|Baron Dhanis]], consisted of a sizable force, numbering around 3,000, and was to strike north through the jungle and attack the rebels at their base at Rejaf. The second, a much smaller force of 800, was led by [[Louis-Napol\u00e9on Chaltin]] and took the main road towards Rejaf.

At first, ivory was exported, but this did not yield the expected levels of revenue. When the global demand for rubber exploded, attention shifted to the labor-intensive collection of sap from rubber plants. Abandoning the promises of the [[Berlin Conference]] in the late 1890s, the Free State government restricted foreign access and extorted [[forced labor]] from the natives. Abuses, especially in the rubber industry, included slavery of the native population, beatings, widespread killings, and frequent mutilation when production quotas were not met.<ref>Neal Ascherson, ''The King Incorporated: Leopold the Second and the Congo'' (Granta Books, 1999)</ref> Missionary [[John Hobbis Harris|John Harris]] of [[Baringa, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Baringa]] was so shocked by what he had encountered that he wrote to Leopold's chief agent in the Congo, saying: \n<blockquote>I have just returned from a journey inland to the village of Insongo Mboyo.

Big O is a member of a family of notations invented by [[Paul Gustav Heinrich Bachmann|Paul Bachmann]],<ref name=Bachmann /> [[Edmund Landau]],<ref name=Landau /> and others, collectively called '''Bachmann\u2013Landau notation''' or '''asymptotic notation'''.\n\nIn [[computer science]], big O notation is used to [[Computational complexity theory|classify algorithms]] according to how there run time or space requirements grow as the input size grows.<ref name=quantumcomplexity>{{cite web|last1=Mohr|first1=Austin|title=Quantum Computing in Complexity Theory and Theory of Computation|url=http://www.austinmohr.com/Work_files/complexity.pdf|accessdate=7 June 2014|page=2}}</ref>  In [[analytic number theory]], big O notation is often used to express a bound on the difference between an [[arithmetic function|arithmetical function]] and a better understood approximation; a famous example of such a difference is the remainder term in the [[prime number theorem]].\n\nBig O notation characterizes functions according to their growth rates: different functions with the same growth rate may be represented using the same O notation.\n\nThe letter O is used because the growth rate of a function is also referred to as the '''order of the function'''.  A description of a function in terms of big O notation usually only provides an [[upper bound]] on the growth rate of the function. Associated with big O notation are several related notations, using the symbols {{math|''o'', \u03a9, \u03c9, and \u0398}}, to describe other kinds of bounds on asymptotic growth rates.\n\nBig O notation is also used in many other fields to provide similar estimates.\n\n== Formal definition ==\nLet ''f'' be a real or complex valued function and ''g'' a real valued function. Both functions defined on some unbounded subset of the [[real number|real positive numbers]], such that ''g''(''x'') is strictly positive for all large enough values of ''x''.<ref name=LandauO>{{cite book |first=Edmund |last=Landau |authorlink=Edmund Landau |title=Handbuch der Lehre von der Verteilung der Primzahlen |publisher=B.

That is, ''f''(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''O''(''g''(''x'')) if and only if there exists a positive real number ''M'' and a real number ''x''<sub>0</sub> such that\n\n:<math>|f(x)| \\le \\; M g(x)\\text{ for all }x \\ge x_0.</math>\n\nIn many contexts, the assumption that we are interested in the growth rate as the variable ''x'' goes to infinity is left unstated, and one writes more simply that\n\n:<math>f(x) = O(g(x)).</math>\n\nThe notation can also be used to describe the behavior of ''f'' near some real number ''a'' (often, ''a''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0): we say\n\n:<math>f(x)=O(g(x))\\text{ as }x\\to a</math>\n\nif and only if there exist positive numbers ''\u03b4'' and ''M'' such that\n\n:<math>|f(x)| \\le \\; M g(x)\\text{ when } 0 < |x - a| < \\delta.</math>\n\nAs ''g''(''x'') is chosen to be non-zero for values of ''x'' [[Mathematical jargon#sufficiently large|sufficiently close]] to ''a'', both of these definitions can be unified using the [[limit superior]]:\n\n:<math>f(x)=O(g(x))\\text{ as }x \\to a</math>\n\nif and only if\n\n:<math>\\limsup_{x\\to a} \\left|\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\\right| < \\infty.</math> <!-- These absolute value bars may be left out. -->\n\n== Example ==\nIn typical usage the ''O'' notation is asymptotical, that is, it refers to very large ''x''.  In this setting, the contribution of the terms that grow \"most quickly\" will eventually make the other ones irrelevant. As a result, the following simplification rules can be applied:\n*If ''f''(''x'') is a sum of several terms, if there is one with largest growth rate, it can be kept, and all others omitted.\n*If ''f''(''x'') is a product of several factors, any constants (terms in the product that do not depend on ''x'') can be omitted.\nFor example, let ''f''(''x'') = 6''x''<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;2''x''<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;5, and suppose we wish to simplify this function, using ''O'' notation, to describe its growth rate as ''x'' approaches infinity. This function is the sum of three terms: 6''x''<sup>4</sup>, \u22122''x''<sup>3</sup>, and 5. Of these three terms, the one with the highest growth rate is the one with the largest exponent as a function of ''x'', namely 6''x''<sup>4</sup>. Now one may apply the second rule: 6''x''<sup>4</sup> is a product of 6 and ''x''<sup>4</sup> in which the first factor does not depend on ''x''. Omitting this factor results in the simplified form ''x''<sup>4</sup>. Thus, we say that ''f''(''x'') is a \"big-oh\" of (''x''<sup>4</sup>). Mathematically, we can write ''f''(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''O''(''x''<sup>4</sup>).\nOne may confirm this calculation using the formal definition: let ''f''(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;6''x''<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;2''x''<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;5 and ''g''(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x''<sup>4</sup>. Applying the [[#Formal definition|formal definition]] from above, the statement that ''f''(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''O''(''x''<sup>4</sup>) is equivalent to its expansion,\n:<math>|f(x)| \\le \\; M x^4</math>\nfor some suitable choice of ''x''<sub>0</sub> and ''M'' and for all ''x''&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;''x''<sub>0</sub>. To prove this, let ''x''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 and ''M''&nbsp;=&nbsp;13. Then, for all ''x''&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;''x''<sub>0</sub>:\n:<math>\\begin{align}|6x^4 - 2x^3 + 5| &\\le 6x^4 + |2x^3| + 5\\\\\n                                      &\\le 6x^4 + 2x^4 + 5x^4\\\\\n                                      &= 13x^4\\end{align}</math>\nso\n:<math> |6x^4 - 2x^3 + 5| \\le 13 \\,x^4 .</math>\n\n== Usage ==\nBig O notation has two main areas of application:\n* In [[mathematics]], it is commonly used to describe [[Big O notation#Infinitesimal asymptotics|how closely a finite series approximates a given function]], especially in the case of a truncated [[Taylor series]] or [[asymptotic expansion]]\n* In [[computer science]], it is useful in the [[Big O notation#Infinite asymptotics|analysis of algorithms]]\n\nIn both applications the function''g''(''x'') appearing within the ''O''(...) is, typically chosen to be as simple as possible, omitting constant factors and lower order terms.\n\nThere are two formally close, but noticeably different, usages of this notation:\n* [[Infinity|infinite]] asymptotics\n* [[infinitesimal]] asymptotics.\n\nThis distinction is only in application and not in principle, however\u2014the formal definition for the \"big O\" is the same for both cases, only with different limits for the function argument.\n\n=== Infinite asymptotics ===\n[[File:comparison computational complexity.svg|thumb|Graphs of functions commonly used in the analysis of algorithms, showing the number of operations ''N'' versus input size ''n'' for each function]]\nBig O notation is useful when [[analysis of algorithms|analyzing algorithms]] for efficiency.  For example, the time (or the number of steps) it takes to complete a problem of size ''n'' might be found to be ''T''(''n'') = 4''n''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 2''n'' + 2.\nAs ''n'' grows large, the ''n''<sup>2</sup> [[term (mathematics)|term]] will come to dominate, so that all other terms can be neglected\u2014for instance when ''n'' = 500, the term 4''n''<sup>2</sup> is 1000 times as large as the 2''n'' term. Ignoring the latter would have negligible effect on the expression's value for most purposes.\nFurther, the [[coefficient]]s become irrelevant if we compare to any other [[Orders of approximation|order]] of expression, such as an expression containing a term ''n''<sup>3</sup> or ''n''<sup>4</sup>.  Even if ''T''(''n'') = 1,000,000''n''<sup>2</sup>, if ''U''(''n'') = ''n''<sup>3</sup>, the latter will always exceed the former once ''n'' grows larger than 1,000,000 (''T''(1,000,000) = 1,000,000<sup>3</sup>= ''U''(1,000,000)). Additionally, the number of steps depends on the details of the machine model on which the algorithm runs, but different types of machines typically vary by only a constant factor in the number of steps needed to execute an algorithm.\nSo the big O notation captures what remains: we write either\n:<math>\\ T(n)= O(n^2) </math>\nor\n:<math>T(n)\\in O(n^2) </math>\nand say that the algorithm has ''order of n<sup>2</sup>'' time complexity.\nThe sign \"=\" is not meant to express \"is equal to\" in its normal mathematical sense, but rather a more colloquial \"is\", so the second expression is sometimes considered more accurate (see the \"[[#Equals sign|Equals sign]]\" discussion below) while the first is considered by some as an [[abuse of notation]].<ref name=\"clrs3\" />\n\n=== Infinitesimal asymptotics ===\nBig O can also be used to describe the [[Taylor series#Approximation error and convergence|error term]] in an approximation to a mathematical function. The most significant terms are written explicitly, and then the least-significant terms are summarized in a single big O term.  Consider, for example, the [[Exponential function#Formal definition|exponential series]] and two expressions of it that are valid when ''x'' is small:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\ne^x &=1+x+\\frac{x^2}{2!}+\\frac{x^3}{3!}+\\frac{x^4}{4!}+\\dotsb &\\text{for all } x\\\\\n    &=1+x+\\frac{x^2}{2}+O(x^3)                             &\\text{as } x\\to 0\\\\\n    &=1+x+O(x^2)                                           &\\text{as } x\\to 0\\\\\n\\end{align}</math>\nThe second expression (the one with ''O''(''x''<sup>3</sup>)) means the absolute-value of the error ''e''<sup>''x''</sup> \u2212 (1 + ''x'' + ''x''<sup>2</sup>/2) is at most some constant times {{!}}''x''<sup>3</sup>{{!}} when ''x'' is close enough to&nbsp;0.\n\n== Properties ==\nIf the function ''f'' can be written as a finite sum of other functions, then the fastest growing one determines the order of ''f''(''n''). For example,\n:<math>f(n) = 9 \\log n + 5 (\\log n)^4 + 3n^2 + 2n^3 = O(n^3) \\qquad\\text{as } n\\to\\infty .</math>\nIn particular, if a function may be bounded by a polynomial in ''n'', then as ''n'' tends to ''infinity'', one may disregard ''lower-order'' terms of the polynomial.\nThe sets ''O''(''n''<sup>''c''</sup>) and ''O''(''c''<sup>''n''</sup>) are very different. If ''c'' is greater than one, then the latter grows much faster. A function that grows faster than ''n''<sup>''c''</sup> for any ''c''  is called ''superpolynomial''.  One that grows more slowly than any exponential function of the form ''c''<sup>''n''</sup> is called ''subexponential''. An algorithm can require time that is both superpolynomial and subexponential; examples of this include the fastest known algorithms for [[integer factorization]] and the function ''n''<sup>log ''n''</sup>.\n\nWe may ignore any powers of ''n'' inside of the logarithms. The set ''O''(log ''n'') is exactly the same as ''O''(log(''n''<sup>''c''</sup>)). The logarithms differ only by a constant factor (since\nlog(''n''<sup>''c''</sup>) = ''c'' log ''n'') and thus the big O notation ignores that. Similarly, logs with different constant bases are equivalent. On the other hand, exponentials with different bases are not of the same order. For example, 2<sup>''n''</sup> and 3<sup>''n''</sup> are not of the same order.\n\nChanging units may or may not affect the order of the resulting algorithm. Changing units is equivalent to multiplying the appropriate variable by a constant wherever it appears. For example, if an algorithm runs in the order of ''n''<sup>2</sup>, replacing ''n'' by ''cn'' means the algorithm runs in the order of ''c''<sup>2</sup>''n''<sup>2</sup>, and the big O notation ignores the constant ''c''<sup>2</sup>. This can be written as ''c''<sup>2</sup>''n''<sup>2</sup> = O(''n''<sup>2</sup>). If, however, an algorithm runs in the order of 2<sup>''n''</sup>, replacing ''n'' with ''cn'' gives 2<sup>''cn''</sup> = (2<sup>''c''</sup>)<sup>n</sup>. This is not equivalent to 2<sup>''n''</sup> in general.\nChanging variables may also affect the order of the resulting algorithm. For example, if an algorithm's run time is ''O''(''n'') when measured in terms of the number ''n'' of ''digits'' of an input number ''x'', then its run time is ''O''(log ''x'') when measured as a function of the input number ''x'' itself, because ''n'' = ''O''(log ''x'').\n\n=== Product ===\n:<math> f_1 = O(g_1) \\text{ and } f_2 = O(g_2)\\, \\Rightarrow f_1  f_2 = O(g_1  g_2)</math>\n:<math>f\\cdot O(g) = O(f g)</math>\n\n=== Sum ===\n:<math> f_1 = O(g_1) \\text{ and }\n  f_2= O(g_2)\\, \\Rightarrow f_1 + f_2 = O(\\max(g_1, g_2))</math>\nThis implies <math> f_1 = O(g) \\text{ and } f_2 = O(g) \\Rightarrow f_1+f_2 \\in O(g) </math>, which means that <math>O(g)</math> is a [[convex cone]].\n\n=== Multiplication by a constant ===\n:Let ''k'' be constant. Then:\n:<math>\\ O(|k| g) = O(g)</math> if ''k'' is nonzero.\n:<math>f= O(g) \\Rightarrow kf = O(g). </math>\n\n== Multiple variables ==\nBig ''O'' (and little o, \u03a9, etc.) can also be used with multiple variables.\nTo define big ''O'' formally for multiple variables, suppose <math>f</math> and <math>g</math> are two functions defined on some subset of <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math>.

For example, the statement\n:<math>f(n,m) = n^2 + m^3 + O(n+m) \\text{ as } n,m\\to\\infty</math>\nasserts that there exist constants ''C'' and ''M'' such that\n:<math>\\forall \\|(n, m)\\|_{\\infty} \\geq M:  |g(n,m)| \\le C|n+m|,</math>\nwhere ''g''(''n'',''m'') is defined by\n:<math>f(n,m) = n^2 + m^3 + g(n,m).</math>\nThis definition allows all of the coordinates of <math>\\vec{x}</math> to increase to infinity. In particular, the statement\n:<math>f(n,m) = O(n^m) \\text{ as } n,m\\to\\infty</math>\n(i.e., <math>\\exists C\\,\\exists M\\,\\forall n\\,\\forall m\\dots</math>) is quite different from\n:<math>\\forall m\\colon f(n,m) = O(n^m) \\text{ as } n\\to\\infty</math>\n(i.e., <math>\\forall m\\,\\exists C\\,\\exists M\\,\\forall n\\dots</math>).\n\nUnder this definition, the subset on which a function is defined is significant when generalizing statements from the univariate setting to the multivariate setting. For example, if <math>f(n,m)=1</math> and <math>g(n,m)=n</math>, then <math>f(n,m)=O(g(n,m))</math> if we restrict <math>f</math> and <math>g</math> to <math>[1,\\infty)^2</math>, but not if they are defined on <math>[0,\\infty)^2</math>.\n\nThis is not the only generalization of big O to multivariate functions, and in practice, there is some inconsistency in the choice of definition.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Howell|first1=Rodney|title=On Asymptotic Notation with Multiple Variables|url=http://people.cis.ksu.edu/~rhowell/asymptotic.pdf|accessdate=2015-04-23}}</ref>\n\n== Matters of notation ==\n\n=== Equals sign ===\nThe statement \"''f''(''x'') is ''O''(''g''(''x''))\" as defined above is usually written as ''f''(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''O''(''g''(''x'')).

For example, ''h''(''x'') + ''O''(''f''(''x'')) denotes the collection of functions having the growth of ''h''(''x'') plus a part whose growth is limited to that of ''f''(''x''). Thus,\n:<math>g(x) = h(x) + O(f(x))</math>\nexpresses the same as\n:<math>g(x) - h(x) = O(f(x))\\,.</math>\n\n==== Example {{anchor|Example (Matters of notation)}} ====\nSuppose an [[algorithm]] is being developed to operate on a set of ''n'' elements. Its developers are interested in finding a function ''T''(''n'')  that will express how long the algorithm will take to run (in some arbitrary measurement of time) in terms of the number of elements in the input set. The algorithm works by first calling a subroutine to sort the elements in the set and then perform its own operations. The sort has a known time complexity of ''O''(''n''<sup>2</sup>), and after the subroutine runs the algorithm must take an additional  55''n''<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;2''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;10 steps before it terminates.  Thus the overall time complexity of the algorithm can be expressed as ''T''(''n'') = 55''n''<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''O''(''n''<sup>2</sup>).\nHere the terms 2''n''+10 are subsumed within the faster-growing ''O''(''n''<sup>2</sup>).  Again, this usage disregards some of the formal meaning of the \"=\" symbol, but it does allow one to use the big O notation as a kind of convenient placeholder.\n\n=== Multiple uses ===\nIn more complicated usage, ''O''(...) can appear in different places in an equation, even several times on each side. For example, the following are true for <math>n\\to\\infty</math>\n:<math>(n+1)^2 = n^2 + O(n)</math>\n:<math>(n+O(n^{1/2}))(n + O(\\log n))^2 = n^3 + O(n^{5/2})</math>\n:<math>n^{O(1)} = O(e^n).</math>\nThe meaning of such statements is as follows: for ''any'' functions which satisfy each ''O''(...) on the left side, there are ''some'' functions satisfying each ''O''(...) on the right side, such that substituting all these functions into the equation makes the two sides equal. For example, the third equation above means: \"For any function ''f''(''n'') = ''O''(1), there is some function ''g''(''n'')  = ''O''(''e''<sup>''n''</sup>) such that ''n''<sup>''f''(''n'')</sup> = ''g''(''n'').\" In terms of the \"set notation\" above, the meaning is that the class of functions represented by the left side is a subset of the class of functions represented by the right side. In this use the \"=\" is a formal symbol that unlike the usual use of \"=\" is not a [[symmetric relation]]. Thus for example ''n''<sup>''O''(1)</sup> = ''O''(''e''<sup>''n''</sup>) does not imply the false statement ''O''(''e''<sup>''n''</sup>) = ''n''<sup>''O''(1)</sup>\n\n=== Typesetting ===\nBig O consists of just an uppercase \"O\".  Unlike Greek-named Bachmann\u2013Landau notations, it needs no special symbol.  Yet, commonly used calligraphic variants, like <math>\\mathcal{O}</math>, are available, in [[LaTeX]] and derived typesetting systems.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://texblog.org/2014/06/24/big-o-and-related-notations-in-latex/ |title=Big O and related notations in LaTeX |date=24 June 2014 |author=Tom |work=texblog}}</ref>\n\n== Orders of common functions ==\n{{Further|Time complexity#Table of common time complexities}}\n\nHere is a list of classes of functions that are commonly encountered when analyzing the running time of an algorithm.

For example, <math>2x^2 = O(x^2) </math> but <math>2x^2 \\neq o(x^2). </math>\n\nAs ''g''(''x'') is nonzero, or at least becomes nonzero beyond a certain point, the relation {{math|''f''(''x'')&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;''o''(''g''(''x''))}} is equivalent to\n:<math>\\lim_{x \\to \\infty}\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=0</math> (and this is in fact how Landau<ref name=Landausmallo /> originally defined the little-o notation).\n\nLittle-o respects a number of arithmetic operations.

In some fields, however, the big O notation (number 2 in the lists above) would be used more commonly than the big Theta notation (items numbered 3 in the lists above). For example, if ''T''(''n'') represents the running time of a newly developed algorithm for input size ''n'', the inventors and users of the algorithm might be more inclined to put an upper asymptotic bound on how long it will take to run without making an explicit statement about the lower asymptotic bound.\n\n=== Other notation ===\n\nIn their book ''[[Introduction to Algorithms]]'', [[Thomas H.

In general, however, when asymptotic notation appears in a formula, we interpret it as standing for some anonymous function that we do not care to name. For example, the formula 2''n''<sup>2</sup> + 3''n'' + 1 = 2''n''<sup>2</sup> + ''\u03b8''(''n'') means that 2''n''<sup>2</sup> + 3''n'' + 1 = 2''n''<sup>2</sup> + ''f''(''n''), where ''f''(''n'') is some function in the set ''\u03b8''(''n''). In this case, we let ''f''(''n'') = 3''n'' + 1, which is indeed in ''\u03b8''(''n'').

Essentially, it is big O notation, ignoring logarithmic factors because the growth-rate effects of some other super-logarithmic function indicate a growth-rate explosion for large-sized input parameters that is more important to predicting bad run-time performance than the finer-point effects contributed by the logarithmic-growth factor(s). This notation is often used to obviate the \"nitpicking\" within growth-rates that are stated as too tightly bounded for the matters at hand (since log<sup>''k''</sup>&nbsp;''n'' is always ''o''(''n''<sup>\u03b5</sup>) for any constant ''k'' and any \u03b5&nbsp;>&nbsp;0).\n\nAlso the [[L-notation|L notation]], defined as\n:<math>L_n[\\alpha,c]=e^{(c+o(1))(\\ln n)^\\alpha(\\ln\\ln n)^{1-\\alpha}}</math>\nis convenient for functions that are between [[Time complexity#Polynomial time|polynomial]] and [[Time complexity#Exponential time|exponential]] in terms of <math>\\ln n</math>.\n\n== Generalizations and related usages ==\nThe generalization to functions taking values in any [[normed vector space]] is straightforward (replacing absolute values by norms), where ''f'' and ''g'' need not take their values in the same space. A generalization to functions ''g'' taking values in any [[topological group]] is also possible{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.\nThe \"limiting process\" ''x''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''x''<sub>o</sub> can also be generalized by introducing an arbitrary [[filter base]], i.e. to directed [[net (mathematics)|nets]] ''f'' and&nbsp;''g''.\nThe ''o'' notation can be used to define [[derivative]]s and [[differentiability]] in quite general spaces, and also (asymptotical) equivalence of functions,\n:<math> f\\sim g \\iff (f-g) \\in o(g) </math>\nwhich is an [[equivalence relation]] and a more restrictive notion than the relationship \"''f'' is \u0398(''g'')\" from above. (It reduces to lim ''f'' / ''g'' = 1 if ''f'' and ''g'' are positive real valued functions.)  For example, 2''x'' is \u0398(''x''), but 2''x''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''x'' is not ''o''(''x'').\n\n== History (Bachmann\u2013Landau, Hardy, and Vinogradov notations) ==\n\nThe symbol O was first introduced by number theorist [[Paul Bachmann]] in 1894, in the second volume of his book ''Analytische Zahlentheorie'' (\"[[analytic number theory]]\").<ref name=Bachmann>{{cite book |first=Paul |last=Bachmann |authorlink=Paul Bachmann |title=Analytische Zahlentheorie |trans-title=Analytic Number Theory |language=de |volume=2 |location=Leipzig |publisher=Teubner |date=1894 |url=https://archive.org/stream/dieanalytischeza00bachuoft#page/402/mode/2up}}</ref> The number theorist [[Edmund Landau]] adopted it, and was thus inspired to introduce in 1909 the notation o;<ref name=Landau>{{cite book |first=Edmund |last=Landau |authorlink=Edmund Landau |title=Handbuch der Lehre von der Verteilung der Primzahlen |publisher=B.

It is a member of a family of notations invented by [[Paul Gustav Heinrich Bachmann|Paul Bachmann]],<ref name=Bachmann /> [[Edmund Landau]],<ref name=Landau /> and others, collectively called '''Bachmann\u2013Landau notation''' or '''asymptotic notation'''.\n\nIn [[computer science]], big O notation is used to [[Computational complexity theory|classify algorithms]] according to how their running time or space requirements grow as the input size grows.<ref name=quantumcomplexity>{{cite web|last1=Mohr|first1=Austin|title=Quantum Computing in Complexity Theory and Theory of Computation|url=http://www.austinmohr.com/Work_files/complexity.pdf|accessdate=7 June 2014|page=2}}</ref>  In [[analytic number theory]], big O notation is often used to express a bound on the difference between an [[arithmetic function|arithmetical function]] and a better understood approximation; a famous example of such a difference is the remainder term in the [[prime number theorem]].\n\nBig O notation characterizes functions according to their growth rates: different functions with the same growth rate may be represented using the same O notation.\n\nThe letter O is used because the growth rate of a function is also referred to as the '''order of the function'''.  A description of a function in terms of big O notation usually only provides an [[upper bound]] on the growth rate of the function. Associated with big O notation are several related notations, using the symbols {{math|''o'', \u03a9, \u03c9, and \u0398}}, to describe other kinds of bounds on asymptotic growth rates.\n\nBig O notation is also used in many other fields to provide similar estimates.\n\n== Formal definition ==\nLet ''f'' be a real or complex valued function and ''g'' a real valued function, both defined on some unbounded subset of the [[real number|real positive numbers]], such that ''g''(''x'') is strictly positive for all large enough values of ''x''.<ref name=LandauO>{{cite book |first=Edmund |last=Landau |authorlink=Edmund Landau |title=Handbuch der Lehre von der Verteilung der Primzahlen |publisher=B.

That is, ''f''(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''O''(''g''(''x'')) if and only if there exists a positive real number ''M'' and a real number ''x''<sub>0</sub> such that\n\n:<math>|f(x)| \\le \\; M g(x)\\text{ for all }x \\ge x_0.</math>\n\nIn many contexts, the assumption that we are interested in the growth rate as the variable ''x'' goes to infinity is left unstated, and one writes more simply that\n\n:<math>f(x) = O(g(x)).</math>\n\nThe notation can also be used to describe the behavior of ''f'' near some real number ''a'' (often, ''a''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0): we say\n\n:<math>f(x)=O(g(x))\\text{ as }x\\to a</math>\n\nif and only if there exist positive numbers ''\u03b4'' and ''M'' such that\n\n:<math>|f(x)| \\le \\; M g(x)\\text{ when } 0 < |x - a| < \\delta.</math>\n\nAs ''g''(''x'') is chosen to be non-zero for values of ''x'' [[Mathematical jargon#sufficiently large|sufficiently close]] to ''a'', both of these definitions can be unified using the [[limit superior]]:\n\n:<math>f(x)=O(g(x))\\text{ as }x \\to a</math>\n\nif and only if\n\n:<math>\\limsup_{x\\to a} \\left|\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\\right| < \\infty.</math> <!-- These absolute value bars may be left out. -->\n\n== Example ==\nIn typical usage the ''O'' notation is asymptotical, that is, it refers to very large ''x''.  In this setting, the contribution of the terms that grow \"most quickly\" will eventually make the other ones irrelevant. As a result, the following simplification rules can be applied:\n*If ''f''(''x'') is a sum of several terms, if there is one with largest growth rate, it can be kept, and all others omitted.\n*If ''f''(''x'') is a product of several factors, any constants (terms in the product that do not depend on ''x'') can be omitted.\nFor example, let ''f''(''x'') = 6''x''<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;2''x''<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;5, and suppose we wish to simplify this function, using ''O'' notation, to describe its growth rate as ''x'' approaches infinity. This function is the sum of three terms: 6''x''<sup>4</sup>, \u22122''x''<sup>3</sup>, and 5. Of these three terms, the one with the highest growth rate is the one with the largest exponent as a function of ''x'', namely 6''x''<sup>4</sup>. Now one may apply the second rule: 6''x''<sup>4</sup> is a product of 6 and ''x''<sup>4</sup> in which the first factor does not depend on ''x''. Omitting this factor results in the simplified form ''x''<sup>4</sup>. Thus, we say that ''f''(''x'') is a \"big-oh\" of (''x''<sup>4</sup>). Mathematically, we can write ''f''(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''O''(''x''<sup>4</sup>).\nOne may confirm this calculation using the formal definition: let ''f''(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;6''x''<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;2''x''<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;5 and ''g''(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x''<sup>4</sup>. Applying the [[#Formal definition|formal definition]] from above, the statement that ''f''(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''O''(''x''<sup>4</sup>) is equivalent to its expansion,\n:<math>|f(x)| \\le \\; M x^4</math>\nfor some suitable choice of ''x''<sub>0</sub> and ''M'' and for all ''x''&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;''x''<sub>0</sub>. To prove this, let ''x''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 and ''M''&nbsp;=&nbsp;13. Then, for all ''x''&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;''x''<sub>0</sub>:\n:<math>\\begin{align}|6x^4 - 2x^3 + 5| &\\le 6x^4 + |2x^3| + 5\\\\\n                                      &\\le 6x^4 + 2x^4 + 5x^4\\\\\n                                      &= 13x^4\\end{align}</math>\nso\n:<math> |6x^4 - 2x^3 + 5| \\le 13 \\,x^4 .</math>\n\n== Usage ==\nBig O notation has two main areas of application:\n* in [[mathematics]], it is commonly used to describe [[Big O notation#Infinitesimal asymptotics|how closely a finite series approximates a given function]], especially in the case of a truncated [[Taylor series]] or [[asymptotic expansion]]\n* in [[computer science]], it is useful in the [[Big O notation#Infinite asymptotics|analysis of algorithms]]\n\nIn both applications, the function ''g''(''x'') appearing within the ''O''(...) is typically chosen to be as simple as possible, omitting constant factors and lower order terms.\n\nThere are two formally close, but noticeably different, usages of this notation:\n* [[Infinity|infinite]] asymptotics\n* [[infinitesimal]] asymptotics.\n\nThis distinction is only in application and not in principle, however\u2014the formal definition for the \"big O\" is the same for both cases, only with different limits for the function argument.\n\n=== Infinite asymptotics ===\n[[File:comparison computational complexity.svg|thumb|Graphs of functions commonly used in the analysis of algorithms, showing the number of operations ''N'' versus input size ''n'' for each function]]\nBig O notation is useful when [[analysis of algorithms|analyzing algorithms]] for efficiency.  For example, the time (or the number of steps) it takes to complete a problem of size ''n'' might be found to be ''T''(''n'') = 4''n''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 2''n'' + 2.\nAs ''n'' grows large, the ''n''<sup>2</sup> [[term (mathematics)|term]] will come to dominate, so that all other terms can be neglected\u2014for instance when ''n'' = 500, the term 4''n''<sup>2</sup> is 1000 times as large as the 2''n'' term. Ignoring the latter would have negligible effect on the expression's value for most purposes.\nFurther, the [[coefficient]]s become irrelevant if we compare to any other [[Orders of approximation|order]] of expression, such as an expression containing a term ''n''<sup>3</sup> or ''n''<sup>4</sup>.  Even if ''T''(''n'') = 1,000,000''n''<sup>2</sup>, if ''U''(''n'') = ''n''<sup>3</sup>, the latter will always exceed the former once ''n'' grows larger than 1,000,000 (''T''(1,000,000) = 1,000,000<sup>3</sup>= ''U''(1,000,000)). Additionally, the number of steps depends on the details of the machine model on which the algorithm runs, but different types of machines typically vary by only a constant factor in the number of steps needed to execute an algorithm.\nSo the big O notation captures what remains: we write either\n:<math>\\ T(n)= O(n^2) </math>\nor\n:<math>T(n)\\in O(n^2) </math>\nand say that the algorithm has ''order of n<sup>2</sup>'' time complexity.\nThe sign \"=\" is not meant to express \"is equal to\" in its normal mathematical sense, but rather a more colloquial \"is\", so the second expression is sometimes considered more accurate (see the \"[[#Equals sign|Equals sign]]\" discussion below) while the first is considered by some as an [[abuse of notation]].<ref name=\"clrs3\" />\n\n=== Infinitesimal asymptotics ===\nBig O can also be used to describe the [[Taylor series#Approximation error and convergence|error term]] in an approximation to a mathematical function. The most significant terms are written explicitly, and then the least-significant terms are summarized in a single big O term.  Consider, for example, the [[Exponential function#Formal definition|exponential series]] and two expressions of it that are valid when ''x'' is small:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\ne^x &=1+x+\\frac{x^2}{2!}+\\frac{x^3}{3!}+\\frac{x^4}{4!}+\\dotsb &\\text{for all } x\\\\\n    &=1+x+\\frac{x^2}{2}+O(x^3)                             &\\text{as } x\\to 0\\\\\n    &=1+x+O(x^2)                                           &\\text{as } x\\to 0\\\\\n\\end{align}</math>\nThe second expression (the one with ''O''(''x''<sup>3</sup>)) means the absolute-value of the error ''e''<sup>''x''</sup> \u2212 (1 + ''x'' + ''x''<sup>2</sup>/2) is at most some constant times {{!}}''x''<sup>3</sup>{{!}} when ''x'' is close enough to&nbsp;0.\n\n== Properties ==\nIf the function ''f'' can be written as a finite sum of other functions, then the fastest growing one determines the order of ''f''(''n''). For example,\n:<math>f(n) = 9 \\log n + 5 (\\log n)^4 + 3n^2 + 2n^3 = O(n^3) \\qquad\\text{as } n\\to\\infty .</math>\nIn particular, if a function may be bounded by a polynomial in ''n'', then as ''n'' tends to ''infinity'', one may disregard ''lower-order'' terms of the polynomial.\nThe sets ''O''(''n''<sup>''c''</sup>) and ''O''(''c''<sup>''n''</sup>) are very different. If ''c'' is greater than one, then the latter grows much faster. A function that grows faster than ''n''<sup>''c''</sup> for any ''c''  is called ''superpolynomial''.  One that grows more slowly than any exponential function of the form ''c''<sup>''n''</sup> is called ''subexponential''. An algorithm can require time that is both superpolynomial and subexponential; examples of this include the fastest known algorithms for [[integer factorization]] and the function ''n''<sup>log ''n''</sup>.\n\nWe may ignore any powers of ''n'' inside of the logarithms. The set ''O''(log ''n'') is exactly the same as ''O''(log(''n''<sup>''c''</sup>)). The logarithms differ only by a constant factor (since\nlog(''n''<sup>''c''</sup>) = ''c'' log ''n'') and thus the big O notation ignores that. Similarly, logs with different constant bases are equivalent. On the other hand, exponentials with different bases are not of the same order. For example, 2<sup>''n''</sup> and 3<sup>''n''</sup> are not of the same order.\n\nChanging units may or may not affect the order of the resulting algorithm. Changing units is equivalent to multiplying the appropriate variable by a constant wherever it appears. For example, if an algorithm runs in the order of ''n''<sup>2</sup>, replacing ''n'' by ''cn'' means the algorithm runs in the order of ''c''<sup>2</sup>''n''<sup>2</sup>, and the big O notation ignores the constant ''c''<sup>2</sup>. This can be written as ''c''<sup>2</sup>''n''<sup>2</sup> = O(''n''<sup>2</sup>). If, however, an algorithm runs in the order of 2<sup>''n''</sup>, replacing ''n'' with ''cn'' gives 2<sup>''cn''</sup> = (2<sup>''c''</sup>)<sup>n</sup>. This is not equivalent to 2<sup>''n''</sup> in general.\nChanging variables may also affect the order of the resulting algorithm. For example, if an algorithm's run time is ''O''(''n'') when measured in terms of the number ''n'' of ''digits'' of an input number ''x'', then its run time is ''O''(log ''x'') when measured as a function of the input number ''x'' itself, because ''n'' = ''O''(log ''x'').\n\n=== Product ===\n:<math> f_1 = O(g_1) \\text{ and } f_2 = O(g_2)\\, \\Rightarrow f_1  f_2 = O(g_1  g_2)</math>\n:<math>f\\cdot O(g) = O(f g)</math>\n\n=== Sum ===\n:<math> f_1 = O(g_1) \\text{ and }\n  f_2= O(g_2)\\, \\Rightarrow f_1 + f_2 = O(\\max(g_1, g_2))</math>\nThis implies <math> f_1 = O(g) \\text{ and } f_2 = O(g) \\Rightarrow f_1+f_2 \\in O(g) </math>, which means that <math>O(g)</math> is a [[convex cone]].\n\n=== Multiplication by a constant ===\n:Let ''k'' be constant.

For example, the statement\n:<math>f(n,m) = n^2 + m^3 + O(n+m) \\text{ as } n,m\\to\\infty</math>\nasserts that there exist constants ''C'' and ''M'' such that\n:<math>\\forall \\|(n, m)\\|_{\\infty} \\geq M:  |g(n,m)| \\le C|n+m|,</math>\nwhere ''g''(''n'',''m'') is defined by\n:<math>f(n,m) = n^2 + m^3 + g(n,m).</math>\nThis definition allows all of the coordinates of <math>\\vec{x}</math> to increase to infinity. In particular, the statement\n:<math>f(n,m) = O(n^m) \\text{ as } n,m\\to\\infty</math>\n(i.e., <math>\\exists C\\,\\exists M\\,\\forall n\\,\\forall m\\dots</math>) is quite different from\n:<math>\\forall m\\colon f(n,m) = O(n^m) \\text{ as } n\\to\\infty</math>\n(i.e., <math>\\forall m\\,\\exists C\\,\\exists M\\,\\forall n\\dots</math>).\n\nUnder this definition, the subset on which a function is defined is significant when generalizing statements from the univariate setting to the multivariate setting.

For example, ''h''(''x'') + ''O''(''f''(''x'')) denotes the collection of functions having the growth of ''h''(''x'') plus a part whose growth is limited to that of ''f''(''x''). Thus,\n:<math>g(x) = h(x) + O(f(x))</math>\nexpresses the same as\n:<math>g(x) - h(x) = O(f(x))\\,.</math>\n\n==== Example {{anchor|Example (Matters of notation)}} ====\nSuppose an [[algorithm]] is being developed to operate on a set of ''n'' elements. Its developers are interested in finding a function ''T''(''n'')  that will express how long the algorithm will take to run (in some arbitrary measurement of time) in terms of the number of elements in the input set. The algorithm works by first calling a subroutine to sort the elements in the set and then perform its own operations. The sort has a known time complexity of ''O''(''n''<sup>2</sup>), and after the subroutine runs the algorithm must take an additional  55''n''<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;2''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;10 steps before it terminates.  Thus the overall time complexity of the algorithm can be expressed as ''T''(''n'') = 55''n''<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''O''(''n''<sup>2</sup>).\nHere the terms 2''n''+10 are subsumed within the faster-growing ''O''(''n''<sup>2</sup>).  Again, this usage disregards some of the formal meaning of the \"=\" symbol, but it does allow one to use the big O notation as a kind of convenient placeholder.\n\n=== Multiple uses ===\nIn more complicated usage, ''O''(...) can appear in different places in an equation, even several times on each side. For example, the following are true for <math>n\\to\\infty</math>\n:<math>(n+1)^2 = n^2 + O(n)</math>\n:<math>(n+O(n^{1/2}))(n + O(\\log n))^2 = n^3 + O(n^{5/2})</math>\n:<math>n^{O(1)} = O(e^n).</math>\nThe meaning of such statements is as follows: for ''any'' functions which satisfy each ''O''(...) on the left side, there are ''some'' functions satisfying each ''O''(...) on the right side, such that substituting all these functions into the equation makes the two sides equal. For example, the third equation above means: \"For any function ''f''(''n'') = ''O''(1), there is some function ''g''(''n'')  = ''O''(''e''<sup>''n''</sup>) such that ''n''<sup>''f''(''n'')</sup> = ''g''(''n'').\" In terms of the \"set notation\" above, the meaning is that the class of functions represented by the left side is a subset of the class of functions represented by the right side. In this use the \"=\" is a formal symbol that unlike the usual use of \"=\" is not a [[symmetric relation]]. Thus for example ''n''<sup>''O''(1)</sup> = ''O''(''e''<sup>''n''</sup>) does not imply the false statement ''O''(''e''<sup>''n''</sup>) = ''n''<sup>''O''(1)</sup>\n\n=== Typesetting ===\nBig O consists of just an uppercase \"O\".  Unlike Greek-named Bachmann\u2013Landau notations, it needs no special symbol.  Yet, commonly used calligraphic variants, like <math>\\mathcal{O}</math>, are available, in [[LaTeX]] and derived typesetting systems.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://texblog.org/2014/06/24/big-o-and-related-notations-in-latex/ |title=Big O and related notations in LaTeX |date=24 June 2014 |author=Tom |work=texblog}}</ref>\n\n== Orders of common functions ==\n{{Further|Time complexity#Table of common time complexities}}\n\nHere is a list of classes of functions that are commonly encountered when analyzing the running time of an algorithm.

For example, <math>2x^2 = O(x^2) </math> but <math>2x^2 \\neq o(x^2). </math>\n\nAs ''g''(''x'') is nonzero, or at least becomes nonzero beyond a certain point, the relation {{math|''f''(''x'')&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;''o''(''g''(''x''))}} is equivalent to\n:<math>\\lim_{x \\to \\infty}\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=0</math> (and this is in fact how Landau<ref name=Landausmallo /> originally defined the little-o notation).\n\nLittle-o respects a number of arithmetic operations.  For example,\n: if {{mvar|c}} is a nonzero constant and <math>f = o(g)</math> then <math>c \\cdot f = o(g)</math>, and\n: if <math>f = o(F)</math> and <math>g = o(G)</math> then <math> f \\cdot g = o(F \\cdot G).</math>\nIt also satisfies a transitivity relation:\n: if <math> f = o(g)</math> and <math> g = o(h)</math> then <math> f = o(h).</math>\n\n=== Big Omega notation ===\n\nThere are two very widespread and incompatible definitions of the statement\n\n:<math>f(x)=\\Omega(g(x))\\ (x\\rightarrow a),</math>\n\nwhere ''a'' is some real number, \u221e,  or \u2212\u221e, where ''f'' and ''g'' are real functions defined in a neighbourhood of ''a'', and where ''g'' is positive in this neighbourhood.\n\nThe first one (chronologically) is used in [[analytic number theory]], and the other one in [[computational complexity theory]].

In some fields, however, the big O notation (number 2 in the lists above) would be used more commonly than the big Theta notation (items numbered 3 in the lists above). For example, if ''T''(''n'') represents the running time of a newly developed algorithm for input size ''n'', the inventors and users of the algorithm might be more inclined to put an upper asymptotic bound on how long it will take to run without making an explicit statement about the lower asymptotic bound.\n\n=== Other notation ===\n\nIn their book ''[[Introduction to Algorithms]]'', [[Thomas H.

Instead, we will usually write ''f''(''n'') = ''\u03b8''(''g''(''n'')) to express the same notion. You might be confused because we abuse equality in this way, but we shall see later in this section that doing so has its advantages.}}</ref> Inside an equation or inequality, the use of asymptotic notation stands for an anonymous function in the set ''O''(''g''), which eliminates lower-order terms, and helps to reduce inessential clutter in equations, for example:<ref>{{cite book |  isbn=978-0-262-53305-8 | author1=Thomas H.

Rivest | title=Introduction to Algorithms | location=Cambridge/MA | publisher=MIT Press | edition=3rd | year=2009 | page=49 | quote= When the asymptotic notation stands alone (that is, not within a larger formula) on the right-hand side of an equation (or inequality), as in n = O(n\u00b2), we have already defined the equal sign to mean set membership: n \u2208 O(n\u00b2). In general, however, when asymptotic notation appears in a formula, we interpret it as standing for some anonymous function that we do not care to name. For example, the formula 2''n''<sup>2</sup> + 3''n'' + 1 = 2''n''<sup>2</sup> + ''\u03b8''(''n'') means that 2''n''<sup>2</sup> + 3''n'' + 1 = 2''n''<sup>2</sup> + ''f''(''n''), where ''f''(''n'') is some function in the set ''\u03b8''(''n''). In this case, we let ''f''(''n'') = 3''n'' + 1, which is indeed in ''\u03b8''(''n''). Using asymptotic notation in this manner can help eliminate inessential detail and clutter in an equation.}}</ref>\n\n:<math> 2n^2 + 3n + 1=2n^2 + O(n).</math>\n\n=== Extensions to the Bachmann\u2013Landau notations ===\nAnother notation sometimes used in computer science is \u00d5 (read ''soft-O''): ''f''(''n'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''\u00d5''(''g''(''n'')) is shorthand\nfor ''f''(''n'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''O''(''g''(''n'')&nbsp;log<sup>''k''</sup>&nbsp;''g''(''n'')) for some ''k''. Essentially, it is big O notation, ignoring logarithmic factors because the growth-rate effects of some other super-logarithmic function indicate a growth-rate explosion for large-sized input parameters that is more important to predicting bad run-time performance than the finer-point effects contributed by the logarithmic-growth factor(s). This notation is often used to obviate the \"nitpicking\" within growth-rates that are stated as too tightly bounded for the matters at hand (since log<sup>''k''</sup>&nbsp;''n'' is always ''o''(''n''<sup>\u03b5</sup>) for any constant ''k'' and any \u03b5&nbsp;>&nbsp;0).\n\nAlso the [[L-notation|L notation]], defined as\n:<math>L_n[\\alpha,c]=e^{(c+o(1))(\\ln n)^\\alpha(\\ln\\ln n)^{1-\\alpha}}</math>\nis convenient for functions that are between [[Time complexity#Polynomial time|polynomial]] and [[Time complexity#Exponential time|exponential]] in terms of <math>\\ln n</math>.\n\n== Generalizations and related usages ==\nThe generalization to functions taking values in any [[normed vector space]] is straightforward (replacing absolute values by norms), where ''f'' and ''g'' need not take their values in the same space. A generalization to functions ''g'' taking values in any [[topological group]] is also possible{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.\nThe \"limiting process\" ''x''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''x''<sub>o</sub> can also be generalized by introducing an arbitrary [[filter base]], i.e. to directed [[net (mathematics)|nets]] ''f'' and&nbsp;''g''.\nThe ''o'' notation can be used to define [[derivative]]s and [[differentiability]] in quite general spaces, and also (asymptotical) equivalence of functions,\n:<math> f\\sim g \\iff (f-g) \\in o(g) </math>\nwhich is an [[equivalence relation]] and a more restrictive notion than the relationship \"''f'' is \u0398(''g'')\" from above. (It reduces to lim ''f'' / ''g'' = 1 if ''f'' and ''g'' are positive real valued functions.)  For example, 2''x'' is \u0398(''x''), but 2''x''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''x'' is not ''o''(''x'').\n\n== History (Bachmann\u2013Landau, Hardy, and Vinogradov notations) ==\n\nThe symbol O was first introduced by number theorist [[Paul Bachmann]] in 1894, in the second volume of his book ''Analytische Zahlentheorie'' (\"[[analytic number theory]]\").<ref name=Bachmann>{{cite book |first=Paul |last=Bachmann |authorlink=Paul Bachmann |title=Analytische Zahlentheorie |trans-title=Analytic Number Theory |language=de |volume=2 |location=Leipzig |publisher=Teubner |date=1894 |url=https://archive.org/stream/dieanalytischeza00bachuoft#page/402/mode/2up}}</ref> The number theorist [[Edmund Landau]] adopted it, and was thus inspired to introduce in 1909 the notation o;<ref name=Landau>{{cite book |first=Edmund |last=Landau |authorlink=Edmund Landau |title=Handbuch der Lehre von der Verteilung der Primzahlen |publisher=B.
