The constitution of [[Namibia]] defines the role of the military as ''\"defending the territory and national interests.\"''\n\nNamibia's military was born from the integration of the formerly belligerent [[People's Liberation Army of Namibia]] (PLAN), military wing of the [[South West African People's Organization]], and the [[South West African Territorial Force]] (SWATF) \u2013 a security arm of the former South African administration. The British formulated the force integration plan and began training the NDF, which consists of five battalions and a small headquarters element.<ref>http://www.satruth.co.za/peace.htm.

[[Martin Shalli]] and [[Charles Namoloh|Charles 'Ho Chi Minh' Namoloh]] were involved in the negotiations that allowed the Kenyan infantry battalion to remain for that period.\n\n==Purpose==\nThe main roles of the Namibian Defence Force are to ensure the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country by guarding against external aggression, both conventional and unconventional; prevent violation of Namibia's territorial integrity; and provide assistance to civil authorities in guarding and protecting government buildings and key installations as provided in the Defence Act.<ref>Namibian Ministry of Defence, [http://www.op.gov.na/Decade_peace/mod.htm Ministry of Defence \u2013 Introduction].

Retrieved June 2012. Paper presented at a conference on Changing Dynamics: Military-Strategic Issues for a Future South Africa, hosted by the Institute for Defence Politics in conjunction with the Hanns Seidel Foundation, CSIR conference centre, Pretoria, 6 August 1992.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>You will no doubt recall that the Angola accords were signed in Luanda on 22 December 1988. In November 1989 SWAPO won 57% of the votes in the Namibian General Election and immediately requested the help of a British Military Advisory and Training Team following independence on 21 March 1990. The team, initially 55 strong, was duly deployed on 26 March 1990 and the first leaders cadre, for the 1st and 2nd Battalions, was run from 17 April to 2 June. By 1 July, the 1st Battalion, about 1 000 men strong, accompanied by 5 BMATT Advisors, had deployed to the northern border. By November 1990, only four months later, the 5th Battalion had deployed and in early 1991 the 21st Guards Battalion had also been formed, four staff courses had been run, support weapons and logistics training was well advanced (indeed a logistics battalion deployed as early as July 1990) and an operational test exercise had been conducted. In addition the Ministry of Defence, a mixture of civilian and military personnel, was operating as a department of state. No-one would pretend that everything was working perfectly, nevertheless, a great deal had been achieved in the first year following independence. Most people would probably agree that at some 7 500 strong the Army is unnecessarily large, but sensible plans will need to be made for the employment of any surplus soldiers before they are discharged. Integration has not been easy to achieve, at least in part, because of the need to use several interpreters to cope with the wide variety of languages involved. Battalions are made up of approximately 70% ex-PLAN and 30% ex-SWATF. This mixture could have proved explosive but hounded by their BMATT instructors they united in a common task (or perhaps in the face of a common enemy!) and soon realised that they could work well together. At the higher levels, integration has been more patchy, at least in part because of the departure of most white South African and SWATF officers. But the Government's intentions seem clear in that it decided to split the four MOD directorates evenly, appointing two white and two black (ex PLAN) directors. In all this, BMATT Namibia has played a role remarkably similar to that of BMATT Zimbabwe.</blockquote>\n[[File:Namibian Air Force K-8.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Air Force K-8]]\nIn August 1999, a separatist Lozi faction in the [[Caprivi Strip]] launched a coup attempt (see [[Caprivi conflict]]) which was summarily put down by the Namibian Defence Force.<ref>Source [[Lonely Planet]]</ref> The army has conducted security operations along the northern border with [[Angola]].

The constitution of [[Namibia]] defines the role of the military as ''\"defending the territory and national interests.\"''\n\nNamibia's military was born from the integration of the formerly belligerent [[People's Liberation Army of Namibia]] (PLAN), military wing of the [[South West African People's Organization]], and the [[South West African Territorial Force]] (SWATF) \u2013 a security arm of the former South African administration. The British formulated the force integration plan and began training the NDF, which consists of five battalions and a small headquarters element.<ref>http://www.satruth.co.za/peace.htm.

Retrieved June 2012. Paper presented at a conference on Changing Dynamics: Military-Strategic Issues for a Future South Africa, hosted by the Institute for Defence Politics in conjunction with the Hanns Seidel Foundation, CSIR conference centre, Pretoria, 6 August 1992.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>You will no doubt recall that the Angola accords were signed in Luanda on 22 December 1988. In November 1989 SWAPO won 57% of the votes in the Namibian General Election and immediately requested the help of a British Military Advisory and Training Team following independence on 21 March 1990. The team, initially 55 strong, was duly deployed on 26 March 1990 and the first leaders cadre, for the 1st and 2nd Battalions, was run from 17 April to 2 June. By 1 July, the 1st Battalion, about 1 000 men strong, accompanied by 5 BMATT Advisors, had deployed to the northern border. By November 1990, only four months later, the 5th Battalion had deployed and in early 1991 the 21st Guards Battalion had also been formed, four staff courses had been run, support weapons and logistics training was well advanced (indeed a logistics battalion deployed as early as July 1990) and an operational test exercise had been conducted. In addition the Ministry of Defence, a mixture of civilian and military personnel, was operating as a department of state. No-one would pretend that everything was working perfectly, nevertheless, a great deal had been achieved in the first year following independence. Most people would probably agree that at some 7 500 strong the Army is unnecessarily large, but sensible plans will need to be made for the employment of any surplus soldiers before they are discharged. Integration has not been easy to achieve, at least in part, because of the need to use several interpreters to cope with the wide variety of languages involved. Battalions are made up of approximately 70% ex-PLAN and 30% ex-SWATF. This mixture could have proved explosive but hounded by their BMATT instructors they united in a common task (or perhaps in the face of a common enemy!) and soon realised that they could work well together. At the higher levels, integration has been more patchy, at least in part because of the departure of most white South African and SWATF officers. But the Government's intentions seem clear in that it decided to split the four MOD directorates evenly, appointing two white and two black (ex PLAN) directors. In all this, BMATT Namibia has played a role remarkably similar to that of BMATT Zimbabwe.</blockquote>\n[[File:Namibian Air Force K-8.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Air Force K-8]]\nIn August 1999, a separatist Lozi faction in the [[Caprivi Strip]] launched a coup attempt (see [[Caprivi conflict]]) which was summarily put down by the Namibian Defence Force.<ref>Source [[Lonely Planet]]</ref> The army has conducted security operations along the northern border with [[Angola]].

The gluons are the force carriers, or bosons, of the QCD color force, while the quarks by themselves are their fermionic matter counterparts.\n\nWe study quark-gluon plasma to recreate and understand the high energy density conditions prevailing in the Universe when matter formed from elementary degrees of freedom (quarks, gluons) at about 20\u03bcs after the [[Big Bang]].

Other parts of this theory deal with [[electroweak interaction]]s and [[neutrino]]s. The [[quantum electrodynamics|theory of electrodynamics]] has been tested and found correct to a few parts in a billion. The [[electroweak interaction|theory of weak interactions]] has been tested and found correct to a few parts in a thousand. Perturbative forms of QCD have been tested to a few percent.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tanabashi|first=M.|last2=Hagiwara|first2=K.|last3=Hikasa|first3=K.|last4=Nakamura|first4=K.|last5=Sumino|first5=Y.|last6=Takahashi|first6=F.|last7=Tanaka|first7=J.|last8=Agashe|first8=K.|last9=Aielli|first9=G.|last10=Amsler|first10=C.|last11=Antonelli|first11=M.|date=|year=2018|title=Review of Particle Physics|url=http://pdg.lbl.gov/2019/reviews/rpp2019-rev-qcd.pdf|journal=Physical Review D|language=en|volume=98|issue=3|page=|pages=030001|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.98.030001|issn=2470-0010|via=}}</ref> Perturbative models assume relatively small changes from the ground state, i.e. relatively low temperatures and densities, which simplifies calculations at the cost of generality. In contrast, non-perturbative forms of QCD have barely been tested. The study of the QGP, which has both a high temperature and density, is part of this effort to consolidate the grand theory of particle physics.\n\nThe study of the QGP is also a testing ground for [[Thermal quantum field theory|finite temperature field theory]], a branch of theoretical physics which seeks to understand particle physics under conditions of high temperature. Such studies are important to understand the early evolution of our universe: [[Timeline of the Big Bang#Very early universe|the first hundred microseconds]] or so. It is crucial to the physics goals of a new generation of observations of the universe ([[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe|WMAP]] and its successors). It is also of relevance to [[grand unification theory|Grand Unification Theories]] which seek to unify the three fundamental forces of nature (excluding gravity).\n\n=== Reasons for studying the formation of quark-gluon plasma ===\nThe generally accepted model of the formation of the [[Universe]] states that it happened as the result of the [[Big Bang]]. In this model, in the time interval of 10<sup>\u201310</sup>\u201310<sup>\u20136</sup> s after the Big Bang, matter existed in the form of a quark-gluon plasma. It is possible to reproduce the density and temperature of matter existing of that time in laboratory conditions to study the characteristics of the very Universe. So far, the only possibility is the collision of two heavy [[Atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] accelerated to energies of more than a hundred GeV. Using the result of a head-on collision in the volume approximately equal to the volume of the atomic nucleus, it is possible to model the density and temperature that existed in the first instants of the life of the Universe.\n\n=== Relation to normal plasma ===\n\nA [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] is matter in which [[Charge (physics)|charges]] are [[Debye length|screened]] due to the presence of other mobile charges.  For example: [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb's Law]] is suppressed by the screening to yield a distance-dependent charge,  <math>Q \\rightarrow Q e^{-r/\\alpha}</math>, i.e., the charge Q is reduced exponentially with the distance divided by a screening length \u03b1. In a QGP, the [[color charge]] of the [[quark]]s and [[gluon]]s is screened. The QGP has other analogies with a normal plasma. There are also dissimilarities because the color charge is [[non-abelian group|non-abelian]], whereas the [[electric charge]] is abelian. Outside a finite volume of QGP the color-electric field is not screened, so that a volume of QGP must still be color-neutral. It will therefore, like a nucleus, have integer electric charge.\n\nBecause of the extremely high energies involved, quark-antiquark pairs are produced by [[pair production]] and thus QGP is a roughly equal mixture of quarks and antiquarks of various flavors, with only a slight excess of quarks. This property is not a general feature of conventional plasmas, which may be too cool for pair production (see however [[pair instability supernova]]).\n\n=== Theory ===\n[[File:WHYrhic.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Five reasons to study quark-gluon plasma.

Since then lattice gauge theory has been used to predict many other properties of this kind of matter. The [[AdS/CFT correspondence]] conjecture may provide insights in QGP, moreover the ultimate goal of the fluid/gravity correspondence is to understand QGP. The QGP is believed to be a phase of QCD which is completely locally thermalized and thus suitable for an effective fluid dynamic description.\n\n=== Production ===\n\nThe QGP can be created by heating matter up to a [[temperature]] of {{val|2|e=12|ul=K}}, which amounts to {{val|175|u=MeV}} per particle. This can be accomplished by colliding two large nuclei at high energy (note that {{val|175|u=MeV}} is not the energy of the colliding beam). [[Lead]] and [[gold]] [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] have been used for such collisions at [[CERN]] [[Super Proton Synchrotron|SPS]] and [[Brookhaven National Laboratory|BNL]] [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider|RHIC]], respectively. The nuclei are accelerated to [[Ultrarelativistic limit|ultrarelativistic speeds]] ([[Length contraction|contracting their length]]) and directed towards each other, creating a \"fireball\", in the rare event of a collision. Hydrodynamic simulation predicts this fireball will expand under its own [[pressure]], and cool while expanding. By carefully studying the spherical and [[elliptic flow]], experimentalists put the theory to test.\n\n=== Diagnostic tools ===\nThere is an overwhelming evidence for production of quark-gluon plasma in relativistic heavy ion collisions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Busza|first=Wit|last2=Rajagopal|first2=Krishna|last3=van der Schee|first3=Wilke|year=2018|title=Heavy ion collisions: The big picture and the big questions|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-nucl-101917-020852|journal=Annual Review of Nuclear and Particle Science|language=en|volume=68|issue=1|pages=339\u2013376|doi=10.1146/annurev-nucl-101917-020852|issn=0163-8998|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=ALICE Collaboration|first=|year=2017|title=Enhanced production of multi-strange hadrons in high-multiplicity proton\u2013proton collisions|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nphys4111|journal=Nature Physics|language=en|volume=13|issue=6|pages=535\u2013539|doi=10.1038/nphys4111|issn=1745-2473|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Koch|first=Peter|last2=M\u00fcller|first2=Berndt|last3=Rafelski|first3=Johann|year=2017|title=From strangeness enhancement to quark\u2013gluon plasma discovery|url=https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0217751X17300241|journal=International Journal of Modern Physics A|language=en|volume=32|issue=31|pages=1730024|doi=10.1142/S0217751X17300241|issn=0217-751X|via=}}</ref><ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=The WA97 Collaboration|first=|last2=|first2=|year=2000|title=Transverse mass spectra of strange and multi\u2013strange particles in Pb\u2013Pb collisions at 158 A GeV/c|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s100520000386|journal=The European Physical Journal C|language=en|volume=14|issue=4|pages=633\u2013641|doi=10.1007/s100520000386|issn=1434-6044|via=}}</ref> \n\nThe important classes of experimental observations are\n\n*[[Strangeness production]]\n*[[Elliptic flow]]\n*[[Jet quenching]]\n*[[J/\u03c8#J/\u03c8 melting|J/\u03c8 melting]]\n*[[Hanbury Brown and Twiss effect]] and [[Bose\u2013Einstein correlations]]\n*[[single particle spectrum|Single particle spectra]] ([[photons]] and [[dilepton]]s)\n\n== Expected properties ==\n\n=== Thermodynamics ===\nThe cross-over temperature from the normal hadronic to the QGP phase is about {{val|175|u=MeV}}. This \"crossover\" may actually ''not'' be only a qualitative feature, but instead one may have to do with a true (second order) phase transition, e.g. of the universality class of the three-dimensional Ising model. The phenomena involved correspond to an energy density of a little less than {{val|1|u=[[Electronvolt|GeV]]/fm<sup>3</sup>}}. For [[Relativistic particle|relativistic]] matter, pressure and temperature are not independent variables, so the [[equation of state]] is a relation between the energy density and the pressure. This has been found through [[lattice gauge theory|lattice computations]], and compared to both [[perturbation theory]] and [[string theory]]. This is still a matter of active research. Response functions such as the [[Specific heat capacity|specific heat]] and various quark number susceptibilities are currently being computed.\n\n=== Flow ===\nThe equation of state is an important input into the flow equations. The [[speed of sound]] is currently under investigation in lattice computations. The [[mean free path]] of quarks and gluons has been computed using [[perturbation theory]] as well as [[string theory]]. [[Lattice gauge theory|Lattice computations]] have been slower here, although the first computations of [[viscosity|transport coefficients]] have recently been concluded. These indicate that the [[mean free time]] of quarks and gluons in the QGP may be comparable to the average interparticle spacing: hence the QGP is a liquid as far as its flow properties go. This is very much an active field of research, and these conclusions may evolve rapidly. The incorporation of dissipative phenomena into hydrodynamics is another recent development that is still in an active stage.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Blaizot|first=J. P.|last2=Ollitrault|first2=J.

Furthermore, once formed, a ball of quark\u2013gluon plasma, like any hot object, transfers heat internally by radiation. However, unlike in everyday objects, there is enough energy available that [[gluon]]s (particles mediating the [[strong force]]) collide and produce an excess of the heavy (i.e. [[Mass-energy equivalence|high-energy]]) [[strange quarks]]. Whereas, if the QGP didn't exist and there was a pure collision, the same energy would be converted into a nonequilibrium mixture containing even heavier quarks such as [[charm quark]]s or [[bottom quark]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ollitrault|first=Jean-Yves|year=1992|title=Anisotropy as a signature of transverse collective flow|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.46.229|journal=Physical Review D|language=en|volume=46|issue=1|pages=229\u2013245|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.46.229|issn=0556-2821|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Borghini|first=Nicolas|last2=Dinh|first2=Phuong Mai|last3=Ollitrault|first3=Jean-Yves|year=2001|title=Flow analysis from multiparticle azimuthal correlations|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevC.64.054901|journal=Physical Review C|language=en|volume=64|issue=5|pages=054901|doi=10.1103/PhysRevC.64.054901|issn=0556-2813|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Jet quenching effect ===\nOne of the most striking physical effects obtained at RHIC energies is the effect of quenching jets. At the first stage of interaction of colliding relativistic nuclei, partons of the colliding nuclei give rise to the secondary partons with a large transverse impulse \u2265 3\u20136 GeV / s. Passing through a highly heated compressed plasma, partons lose energy. The magnitude of the energy loss by the parton depends on the properties of the quark-gluon plasma (temperature, density). In addition, it is also necessary to take into \n\naccount the fact that colored quarks and gluons are the elementary objects of the plasma, which differs from the energy loss by a parton in a medium consisting of colorless [[Hadron|hadrons]]. Under the conditions of a quark-gluon plasma, the energy losses resulting from the RHIC energies by partons are estimated as dE / dx = 1 GeV / fm. This conclusion is confirmed by comparing the relative yield of hadrons with a large transverse impulse in nucleon-nucleon and nucleus-nucleus collisions at the same collision energy. The energy loss by partons with a large transverse impulse in nucleon-nucleon collisions is much smaller than in nucleus-nucleus collisions, which leads to a decrease in the yield of high-energy hadrons in nucleus-nucleus collisions. This result suggests that nuclear collisions cannot be regarded as a simple superposition of nucleon-nucleon collisions. For a short time, ~ 1 \u03bcs and in the final volume, quarks and gluons form some ideal liquid. The collective properties of this fluid are manifested during its movement as a whole. Therefore, when moving partons in this medium, it is necessary to take into account some collective properties of this quark-gluon liquid. Energy losses depend on the properties of the quark-gluon medium, on the parton density in the resulting fireball, and on the dynamics of its expansion. Losses of energy by light and heavy quarks during the passage of a fireball turn out to be approximately the same.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Schukraft|first=J\u00fcrgen|url=https://indico.cern.ch/event/114939/contributions/62599/attachments/48842/70225/CERN_HI_Dec_2010.pdf|title=ALICE\u2014'Little Bang' : The first 3 weeks ...|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n=== Direct photons and dileptons ===\nDirect photons and dileptons are arguably most penetrating tools to study relativistic heavy ion collisions.

They are hard to decipher and interpret as most of the signal is originating from hadron decays long after the QGP fireball has disintegrated.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Albrecht|first=R.|last2=Antonenko|first2=V.|last3=Awes|first3=T.

Many ideas are currently being developed and will be put to test in the near future. It has been hypothesized recently that some mesons built from heavy quarks do not dissolve until the temperature reaches about {{val|350|u=MeV}}. This has led to speculation that many other kinds of bound states may exist in the plasma.

The gluons are the force carriers, or bosons, of the QCD color force, while the quarks by themselves are their fermionic matter counterparts.\n\nWe study quark-gluon plasma to recreate and understand the high energy density conditions prevailing in the Universe when matter formed from elementary degrees of freedom (quarks, gluons) at about 20\u03bcs after the [[Big Bang]].

The [[quantum electrodynamics|theory of electrodynamics]] has been tested and found correct to a few parts in a billion. The [[electroweak interaction|theory of weak interactions]] has been tested and found correct to a few parts in a thousand. Perturbative forms of QCD have been tested to a few percent.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tanabashi|first=M.|last2=Hagiwara|first2=K.|last3=Hikasa|first3=K.|last4=Nakamura|first4=K.|last5=Sumino|first5=Y.|last6=Takahashi|first6=F.|last7=Tanaka|first7=J.|last8=Agashe|first8=K.|last9=Aielli|first9=G.|last10=Amsler|first10=C.|last11=Antonelli|first11=M.|date=|year=2018|title=Review of Particle Physics|url=http://pdg.lbl.gov/2019/reviews/rpp2019-rev-qcd.pdf|journal=Physical Review D|language=en|volume=98|issue=3|page=|pages=030001|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.98.030001|issn=2470-0010|via=}}</ref> Perturbative models assume relatively small changes from the ground state, i.e. relatively low temperatures and densities, which simplifies calculations at the cost of generality. In contrast, non-perturbative forms of QCD have barely been tested. The study of the QGP, which has both a high temperature and density, is part of this effort to consolidate the grand theory of particle physics.\n\nThe study of the QGP is also a testing ground for [[Thermal quantum field theory|finite temperature field theory]], a branch of theoretical physics which seeks to understand particle physics under conditions of high temperature. Such studies are important to understand the early evolution of our universe: [[Timeline of the Big Bang#Very early universe|the first hundred microseconds]] or so. It is crucial to the physics goals of a new generation of observations of the universe ([[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe|WMAP]] and its successors). It is also of relevance to [[grand unification theory|Grand Unification Theories]] which seek to unify the three fundamental forces of nature (excluding gravity).\n\n=== Reasons for studying the formation of quark-gluon plasma ===\nThe generally accepted model of the formation of the [[Universe]] states that it happened as the result of the [[Big Bang]]. In this model, in the time interval of 10<sup>\u201310</sup>\u201310<sup>\u20136</sup> s after the Big Bang, matter existed in the form of a quark-gluon plasma. It is possible to reproduce the density and temperature of matter existing of that time in laboratory conditions to study the characteristics of the very Universe. So far, the only possibility is the collision of two heavy [[Atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] accelerated to energies of more than a hundred GeV. Using the result of a head-on collision in the volume approximately equal to the volume of the atomic nucleus, it is possible to model the density and temperature that existed in the first instants of the life of the Universe.\n\n=== Relation to normal plasma ===\n\nA [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] is matter in which [[Charge (physics)|charges]] are [[Debye length|screened]] due to the presence of other mobile charges.  For example: [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb's Law]] is suppressed by the screening to yield a distance-dependent charge,  <math>Q \\rightarrow Q e^{-r/\\alpha}</math>, i.e., the charge Q is reduced exponentially with the distance divided by a screening length \u03b1. In a QGP, the [[color charge]] of the [[quark]]s and [[gluon]]s is screened. The QGP has other analogies with a normal plasma. There are also dissimilarities because the color charge is [[non-abelian group|non-abelian]], whereas the [[electric charge]] is abelian. Outside a finite volume of QGP the color-electric field is not screened, so that a volume of QGP must still be color-neutral. It will therefore, like a nucleus, have integer electric charge.\n\nBecause of the extremely high energies involved, quark-antiquark pairs are produced by [[pair production]] and thus QGP is a roughly equal mixture of quarks and antiquarks of various flavors, with only a slight excess of quarks. This property is not a general feature of conventional plasmas, which may be too cool for pair production (see however [[pair instability supernova]]).\n\n=== Theory ===\n[[File:WHYrhic.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Five reasons to study quark-gluon plasma.

Since then lattice gauge theory has been used to predict many other properties of this kind of matter. The [[AdS/CFT correspondence]] conjecture may provide insights in QGP, moreover the ultimate goal of the fluid/gravity correspondence is to understand QGP. The QGP is believed to be a phase of QCD which is completely locally thermalized and thus suitable for an effective fluid dynamic description.\n\n=== Production ===\n\nThe QGP can be created by heating matter up to a [[temperature]] of {{val|2|e=12|ul=K}}, which amounts to {{val|175|u=MeV}} per particle. This can be accomplished by colliding two large nuclei at high energy (note that {{val|175|u=MeV}} is not the energy of the colliding beam). [[Lead]] and [[gold]] [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] have been used for such collisions at [[CERN]] [[Super Proton Synchrotron|SPS]] and [[Brookhaven National Laboratory|BNL]] [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider|RHIC]], respectively. The nuclei are accelerated to [[Ultrarelativistic limit|ultrarelativistic speeds]] ([[Length contraction|contracting their length]]) and directed towards each other, creating a \"fireball\", in the rare event of a collision. Hydrodynamic simulation predicts this fireball will expand under its own [[pressure]], and cool while expanding.

This \"crossover\" may actually ''not'' be only a qualitative feature, but instead one may have to do with a true (second order) phase transition, e.g. of the universality class of the three-dimensional Ising model. The phenomena involved correspond to an energy density of a little less than {{val|1|u=[[Electronvolt|GeV]]/fm<sup>3</sup>}}. For [[Relativistic particle|relativistic]] matter, pressure and temperature are not independent variables, so the [[equation of state]] is a relation between the energy density and the pressure. This has been found through [[lattice gauge theory|lattice computations]], and compared to both [[perturbation theory]] and [[string theory]]. This is still a matter of active research. Response functions such as the [[Specific heat capacity|specific heat]] and various quark number susceptibilities are currently being computed.\n\n=== Flow ===\nThe equation of state is an important input into the flow equations. The [[speed of sound]] is currently under investigation in lattice computations. The [[mean free path]] of quarks and gluons has been computed using [[perturbation theory]] as well as [[string theory]]. [[Lattice gauge theory|Lattice computations]] have been slower here, although the first computations of [[viscosity|transport coefficients]] have recently been concluded. These indicate that the [[mean free time]] of quarks and gluons in the QGP may be comparable to the average interparticle spacing: hence the QGP is a liquid as far as its flow properties go. This is very much an active field of research, and these conclusions may evolve rapidly. The incorporation of dissipative phenomena into hydrodynamics is another recent development that is still in an active stage.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Blaizot|first=J. P.|last2=Ollitrault|first2=J.

Furthermore, once formed, a ball of quark\u2013gluon plasma, like any hot object, transfers heat internally by radiation. However, unlike in everyday objects, there is enough energy available that [[gluon]]s (particles mediating the [[strong force]]) collide and produce an excess of the heavy (i.e. [[Mass-energy equivalence|high-energy]]) [[strange quarks]]. Whereas, if the QGP didn't exist and there was a pure collision, the same energy would be converted into a nonequilibrium mixture containing even heavier quarks such as [[charm quark]]s or [[bottom quark]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ollitrault|first=Jean-Yves|year=1992|title=Anisotropy as a signature of transverse collective flow|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.46.229|journal=Physical Review D|language=en|volume=46|issue=1|pages=229\u2013245|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.46.229|issn=0556-2821|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Borghini|first=Nicolas|last2=Dinh|first2=Phuong Mai|last3=Ollitrault|first3=Jean-Yves|year=2001|title=Flow analysis from multiparticle azimuthal correlations|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevC.64.054901|journal=Physical Review C|language=en|volume=64|issue=5|pages=054901|doi=10.1103/PhysRevC.64.054901|issn=0556-2813|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Jet quenching effect ===\nOne of the most striking physical effects obtained at RHIC energies is the effect of quenching jets. At the first stage of interaction of colliding relativistic nuclei, partons of the colliding nuclei give rise to the secondary partons with a large transverse impulse \u2265 3\u20136 GeV / s. Passing through a highly heated compressed plasma, partons lose energy. The magnitude of the energy loss by the parton depends on the properties of the quark-gluon plasma (temperature, density). In addition, it is also necessary to take into \n\naccount the fact that colored quarks and gluons are the elementary objects of the plasma, which differs from the energy loss by a parton in a medium consisting of colorless [[Hadron|hadrons]]. Under the conditions of a quark-gluon plasma, the energy losses resulting from the RHIC energies by partons are estimated as dE / dx = 1 GeV / fm. This conclusion is confirmed by comparing the relative yield of hadrons with a large transverse impulse in nucleon-nucleon and nucleus-nucleus collisions at the same collision energy. The energy loss by partons with a large transverse impulse in nucleon-nucleon collisions is much smaller than in nucleus-nucleus collisions, which leads to a decrease in the yield of high-energy hadrons in nucleus-nucleus collisions. This result suggests that nuclear collisions cannot be regarded as a simple superposition of nucleon-nucleon collisions. For a short time, ~ 1 \u03bcs and in the final volume, quarks and gluons form some ideal liquid. The collective properties of this fluid are manifested during its movement as a whole. Therefore, when moving partons in this medium, it is necessary to take into account some collective properties of this quark-gluon liquid. Energy losses depend on the properties of the quark-gluon medium, on the parton density in the resulting fireball, and on the dynamics of its expansion. Losses of energy by light and heavy quarks during the passage of a fireball turn out to be approximately the same.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Schukraft|first=J\u00fcrgen|url=https://indico.cern.ch/event/114939/contributions/62599/attachments/48842/70225/CERN_HI_Dec_2010.pdf|title=ALICE\u2014'Little Bang' : The first 3 weeks ...|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n=== Direct photons and dileptons ===\nDirect photons and dileptons are arguably most penetrating tools to study relativistic heavy ion collisions.

[3]]]\n\nSome results of the experiments: \n\n\u00b7 Experimental data obtained at the [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider|RHIC]] and [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]] showed that the collision of heavy nuclei cannot be considered as a simple additive set of pp-collisions. \n\n\u00b7 In collisions of heavy nuclei, new previously unknown collective properties of the quark-gluon medium are manifested. \n\n\u00b7 The resulting quark-gluon medium in its properties resembles a superconducting liquid with a low [[Viscosity|viscosity coefficient]]. \n\n\u00b7 A comparison of the data from the STAR and ALICE collaborations shows that the lifetime of the quark-gluon medium formed in the collision of lead nuclei in the ALICE collaboration is almost two times higher than the corresponding result obtained by the STAR collaboration and amounts to 10\u201311 Fm/s. \n[[File:Schematic representation of the interaction region formed.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Schematic representation of the interaction region formed in the first moments after the collision of heavy ions with high energies in the accelerator. [4]]]\n\u00b7 The formation of an elliptical flow and the quenching of jets in a dense quark-gluon medium are confirmed. \n\nTo study the properties of the quark-gluon medium further, more detailed information is needed on the deconfinement mechanism in the quark-gluon medium, the hadronization mechanism, quenching of jets in the quark-gluon plasma, angular distributions of products, and especially on the formation of hadrons containing heavy quarks and [[antiquarks]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080601131517/http:/livefromcern.web.cern.ch/livefromcern/antimatter/history/AM-history01-b.html|title=The History fo Antimatter - from 1928 to 1995|date=2008-06-01|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref> \n\n=== Quark-gluon plasma density ===\nThe central issue of the formation of a quark-gluon plasma remains as follows: whether [[energy density]] can be achieved in nucleus-nucleus collisions and how does it evolve over time? The answer to this question depends on how much energy each nucleon loses, of accelerated nuclei in a collision of beams.\n\nUsually, there are three different stages of nuclear collision distinguished: \n\n\u00b7 The maximum density is reached at the time of complete overlapping of the colliding nuclei. \n\n\u00b7 The maximum energy density transferred to particles born in a fireball. \n\n\u00b7 The maximum energy density at the moment of the local thermalization of a quark-gluon plasma.\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n=== Books ===\n\n*{{open access}} [http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-17545-4 Melting hadrons, boiling quarks] : from Hagedorn temperature to ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions at CERN : with a tribute to Rolf Hagedorn, ed.

{"title_page": "Lake Poets", "text_new": "The '''Lake Poets''' were a group of English [[poets]] who all lived in the [[Lake District]] of [[England]], United Kingdom, in the first half of the nineteenth century. As a group, they followed no single \"school\" of thought or literary practice then known. They were named, only to be uniformly disparaged, by the ''[[Edinburgh Review]]''. They are considered part of the [[Romantic literature in English|Romantic]] Movement.\n\nThe three main figures of what has become known as the Lakes School were [[William Wordsworth]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], and [[Robert Southey]]. They were associated with several other poets and writers, including [[Dorothy Wordsworth]], [[Charles Lamb]], [[Mary Lamb]], [[Charles Lloyd (poet)|Charles Lloyd]], [[Hartley Coleridge]], [[John Wilson (Scottish writer)|John Wilson]], and [[Thomas De Quincey]].\n\n==Origins and accuracy of the name==\nThe \"Lake Poet School\" (or '[[Bards]] of the Lake', or the 'Lake School') was initially a derogatory term (\"the School of whining and hypochondriacal poets that haunt the Lakes\", according to [[Francis Jeffrey]] as reported by Coleridge) <ref>Coleridge (1983), p. 51.</ref> that was also a misnomer, as it was neither particularly born out of the Lake District, nor was it a cohesive school of poetry. The principal members of the 'group' were [[William Wordsworth]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] and [[Robert Southey]]. [[Dorothy Wordsworth]] was an auxiliary member who was unpublished during her lifetime (her journals, letters, and poems were published posthumously), but she provided much of the inspiration for her brother William's work.<ref>Wilson, Frances (2009). ''A Ballad of Dorothy Wordsworth: a Life'' New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux.</ref>\n\nThere was a certain amount of additional [[irony]] involved in the 'School's' perception by readers, who were inspired, upon reading the poetry, to visit the area, thus helping to destroy, in the mind of [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] at least, the very thing that made the Lakes special (although he himself ended up writing one of the best guides to the region). In addition, many of the first and second generation practitioners of [[Romantic poetry]] had a complex and not entirely easy relationship with the Lakes (apart from Wordsworth). \"For the most part other Romantic poets either struggle with a Lake Poet identity or come to define themselves against what the Lakes seem to offer in poetic terms.\" <ref>Bradshaw (2011), p. 79.</ref>\n\n==The Lake poets==\n[[File:Dove Cottage - geograph.org.uk - 70618.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dove Cottage]] (Town End, Grasmere) - home of William and Dorothy Wordsworth, 1799-1808; home of Thomas De Quincey, 1809-1820]]\nFor Wordsworth, who settled at [[Dove Cottage]], [[Grasmere (village)|Grasmere]], with his sister [[Dorothy Wordsworth|Dorothy]] after some years of wandering, the Lakes became bound up with his identity as a poet. Born and brought up on the fringes of the Lake District (at [[Cockermouth]] and [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]]), Wordsworth came back to the area in December 1799 and settled into a 'poetic retirement' within his 'native mountains.' Although Wordsworth did not 'discover' the Lake District, nor was he the one who popularised it the most, he \"was destined to become one of the key attractions to the area, while his particular vision of his native landscape would have an enduring influence upon its future\".<ref>Thompson (2010), p. 59</ref> Not just a 'nature poet', his poetry \"is about the organic relationship between human beings and the natural world...'<ref name=\"Thompson, 2010, p.87\">Thompson (2010), p. 87.</ref> After a brief flirtation with the [[Picturesque]] in his Cambridge years, he came to see this aesthetic view of nature as being only one of many (although it is arguable that he \"was under the sway of Picturesque theory\", he frequently transcended it).<ref>Thompson (2010), p. 160.</ref> His 'vision' of nature was one that did not distort it in order to make art.\n\nWordsworth's early radical political ideas led him to his second poetic innovation: the use of 'plain language' and having for his subject the 'common man', as represented by the Dales-folk, (rather than \"kings and queens, lords and ladies or gods and goddesses\" as was the case up to then).<ref name=\"Thompson, 2010, p.87\"/>  His third innovation was to do with the inward-turning of his mind, producing a semi-autobiographical take on nature and imagination : his poem ''[[The Prelude]]'', he wrote to Dorothy, was \"the poem on the growth of my own mind.\" \n[[File:Rydal Mount - geograph.org.uk - 959824.jpg|thumb|left|[[Rydal Mount]], home to Wordsworth 1813-1850. Hundreds of visitors came here to see him over the years]]\n\nDespite this reclusive side of his personality, Wordsworth was a strong believer in family and community, and he was much concerned with the effects on (especially poor) people's way of life of social change (for example, due to the [[enclosure]] movement) that were taking place. He disliked change that flew in the face of Nature: the planting of regimented lines of Larches; the coming of the railways; new building that did not chime with the [[vernacular]]; and the building of grand houses in the Lakes by the industrialists of Lancashire particularly upset him. In 1810 he published his ''[[Guide to the Lakes]]'', tellingly subtitled \"for the Use of Tourists and Residents\" , and with a Section Three entitled \"Changes, and Rules of Taste for Preventing their Bad Effects.\" <ref>Thompson (2010), p. 157</ref> Nicholson argues that the ''Guide'' was the outcome of the loss of Wordsworth's poetic vision of nature and a turning outwards into hard facts in order to preserve his sanity after \"years, perhaps, of disillusion, disappointment, of spiritual impotence...\" <ref>Nicholson (1995), p. 155</ref> Another aspect of it was the link to the ideas of [[Uvedale Price]], whom Wordsworth knew and who proposed a \"conservative, historicising and non-interventionist aesthetic\".<ref name=\"Albert Museum 1984, p.80\">Victoria and Albert Museum (1984), p. 80.</ref>  The ''Guide'' ran to five editions during Wordsworth's lifetime and proved to be very popular. Indeed, it has been said that \"the architectural axioms of building and gardening in the Lake District for the next hundred years were established by the ''Guide''\".<ref name=\"Albert Museum 1984, p.80\"/>\n\nFor other writers, the region's pull was more uncertain. [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]] followed Wordsworth to the Lakes and moved into [[Greta Hall]] in 1800. Although identified by his contemporaries as a 'Lake Poet', Coleridge's response to the landscape was at variance with the vision of Wordsworth, leading Coleridge to identify the landscape's \"Gothic elements\"...\"and in so doing seems to recognise a potential for psychological horror rather than solace.\" <ref>Bradshaw (2011), p. 67.</ref> Wordsworth's rejection of the poem [[Christabel (poem)|Christabel]], partly written at [[Greta Hall]], for the [[Lyrical Ballads]] collection, added to Coleridge's depression over his personal life, his doubts about being able to write as he would have wished and his ill-health which was made worse by the Cumbrian climate. This led him to resort to the [[Kendal Black Drop]], making matters desperate.  Coleridge moved out of the area in 1804. \n[[File:Greta Hall.jpg|thumb|left|Greta Hall, Keswick - home of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, 1800-1804; home to Robert Southey, 1803-1843]]\n\n[[Robert Southey]], it has been argued, although becoming identified as the central 'Lake Poet' (he lived at Greta Hall from 1803 to 1843), was mostly a prose writer and did not particularly subscribe to the Wordsworthian vision of the Lakes.<ref>Bradshaw (2011), pp. 68-69.</ref> Southey, like Wordsworth, started out on the republican left, but, by the time the threat from Napoleon had dwindled, he had become the embodiment of a [[Tory]] extolling the virtues of nation and patriotism, and using the Lakes as a touchstone, and as \"the symbol of the nation's covenant with God.\" <ref>Bradshaw (2011), p. 69.</ref>\n\n{{wikisource|Letitia Elizabeth Landon (L. E. L.) in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1834/Grasmere Lake|'Grasmere Lake, A Sketch by a Cockney,' by L. E. L.}}\n[[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]]'s sketch, ''Grasmere Lake, A Sketch by a Cockney'', in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1834, is a spoof on the Lake Poets, whom she admired (especially Wordsworth) but regarded as outmoded. In her view the days of Romanticism were over.\n\n==Associated writers==\nThe second generation of Romantic poets were drawn to the area by the Romantic vision of seclusion and by the perceived republican views of the older poets, but found a different reality when they arrived. [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]] lived for three months in 1811 at Keswick, having been drawn to the Lakes by reading the early, \"liberty and equality\" Southey, only to find that Southey's views had changed and that the Lakes had been despoiled by \"the manufacturers.\" \n\n[[John Keats|Keats]], in the Summer of 1818, had a similar response to that of Shelley, finding his hero Wordsworth's house full of fashionable people and Wordsworth himself away canvassing for the local Tory candidate. Keats moved on to Scotland which provided him with the inspiration he sought (and where, in particular, he felt the influence of [[Robert Burns]]). \n\n[[Lord Byron|Byron]] did not visit the Lakes, but he ridiculed the isolation and narrowness of mind of the older Lake Poets, as well as of their abandonment of radical politics.<ref>Bradshaw (2011), pp. 72-74</ref>\n\nThe hale and hearty [[John Wilson (Scottish writer)|John Wilson]] provided an alternative take on the role of Lake Poet. He lived near [[Windermere]] between 1808 and 1815 and knew the older Lake Poet trio well. His poetry (''Isle of Palms'') reveals a physical response to the Lakes scenery (he was an energetic walker and climber), and emphasises companionship and energy as against Wordsworthian quiet and solitude.<ref>Bradshaw (2011), pp. 74-77</ref>\n\nWilson knew both [[Harriet Martineau]] and [[Thomas De Quincey]]. Martineau settled in a house she had built near Ambleside in 1845.

As a group, they followed no single \"school\" of thought or literary practice then known. They were named, only to be uniformly disparaged, by the ''[[Edinburgh Review]]''. They are considered part of the [[Romantic literature in English|Romantic]] Movement.\n\nThe three main figures of what has become known as the Lakes School were [[William Wordsworth]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], and [[Robert Southey]]. They were associated with several other poets and writers, including [[Dorothy Wordsworth]], [[Charles Lamb]], [[Mary Lamb]], [[Charles Lloyd (poet)|Charles Lloyd]], [[Hartley Coleridge]], [[John Wilson (Scottish writer)|John Wilson]], and [[Thomas De Quincey]].\n\n==Origins and accuracy of the name==\nThe \"Lake Poet School\" (or '[[Bards]] of the Lake', or the 'Lake School') was initially a derogatory term (\"the School of whining and hypochondriacal poets that haunt the Lakes\", according to [[Francis Jeffrey]] as reported by Coleridge) <ref>Coleridge (1983), p. 51.</ref> that was also a misnomer, as it was neither particularly born out of the Lake District, nor was it a cohesive school of poetry. The principal members of the 'group' were [[William Wordsworth]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] and [[Robert Southey]]. [[Dorothy Wordsworth]] was an auxiliary member who was unpublished during her lifetime (her journals, letters, and poems were published posthumously), but she provided much of the inspiration for her brother William's work.<ref>Wilson, Frances (2009). ''A Ballad of Dorothy Wordsworth: a Life'' New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux.</ref>\n\nThere was a certain amount of additional [[irony]] involved in the 'School's' perception by readers, who were inspired, upon reading the poetry, to visit the area, thus helping to destroy, in the mind of [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] at least, the very thing that made the Lakes special (although he himself ended up writing one of the best guides to the region). In addition, many of the first and second generation practitioners of [[Romantic poetry]] had a complex and not entirely easy relationship with the Lakes (apart from Wordsworth). \"For the most part other Romantic poets either struggle with a Lake Poet identity or come to define themselves against what the Lakes seem to offer in poetic terms.\" <ref>Bradshaw (2011), p. 79.</ref>\n\n==The Lake poets==\n[[File:Dove Cottage - geograph.org.uk - 70618.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dove Cottage]] (Town End, Grasmere) - home of William and Dorothy Wordsworth, 1799-1808; home of Thomas De Quincey, 1809-1820]]\nFor Wordsworth, who settled at [[Dove Cottage]], [[Grasmere (village)|Grasmere]], with his sister [[Dorothy Wordsworth|Dorothy]] after some years of wandering, the Lakes became bound up with his identity as a poet. Born and brought up on the fringes of the Lake District (at [[Cockermouth]] and [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]]), Wordsworth came back to the area in December 1799 and settled into a 'poetic retirement' within his 'native mountains.' Although Wordsworth did not 'discover' the Lake District, nor was he the one who popularised it the most, he \"was destined to become one of the key attractions to the area, while his particular vision of his native landscape would have an enduring influence upon its future\".<ref>Thompson (2010), p. 59</ref> Not just a 'nature poet', his poetry \"is about the organic relationship between human beings and the natural world...'<ref name=\"Thompson, 2010, p.87\">Thompson (2010), p. 87.</ref> After a brief flirtation with the [[Picturesque]] in his Cambridge years, he came to see this aesthetic view of nature as being only one of many (although it is arguable that he \"was under the sway of Picturesque theory\", he frequently transcended it).<ref>Thompson (2010), p. 160.</ref> His 'vision' of nature was one that did not distort it in order to make art.\n\nWordsworth's early radical political ideas led him to his second poetic innovation: the use of 'plain language' and having for his subject the 'common man', as represented by the Dales-folk, (rather than \"kings and queens, lords and ladies or gods and goddesses\" as was the case up to then).<ref name=\"Thompson, 2010, p.87\"/>  His third innovation was to do with the inward-turning of his mind, producing a semi-autobiographical take on nature and imagination : his poem ''[[The Prelude]]'', he wrote to Dorothy, was \"the poem on the growth of my own mind.\" \n[[File:Rydal Mount - geograph.org.uk - 959824.jpg|thumb|left|[[Rydal Mount]], home to Wordsworth 1813-1850. Hundreds of visitors came here to see him over the years]]\n\nDespite this reclusive side of his personality, Wordsworth was a strong believer in family and community, and he was much concerned with the effects on (especially poor) people's way of life of social change (for example, due to the [[enclosure]] movement) that were taking place. He disliked change that flew in the face of Nature: the planting of regimented lines of Larches; the coming of the railways; new building that did not chime with the [[vernacular]]; and the building of grand houses in the Lakes by the industrialists of Lancashire particularly upset him. In 1810 he published his ''[[Guide to the Lakes]]'', tellingly subtitled \"for the Use of Tourists and Residents\" , and with a Section Three entitled \"Changes, and Rules of Taste for Preventing their Bad Effects.\" <ref>Thompson (2010), p. 157</ref> Nicholson argues that the ''Guide'' was the outcome of the loss of Wordsworth's poetic vision of nature and a turning outwards into hard facts in order to preserve his sanity after \"years, perhaps, of disillusion, disappointment, of spiritual impotence...\" <ref>Nicholson (1995), p. 155</ref> Another aspect of it was the link to the ideas of [[Uvedale Price]], whom Wordsworth knew and who proposed a \"conservative, historicising and non-interventionist aesthetic\".<ref name=\"Albert Museum 1984, p.80\">Victoria and Albert Museum (1984), p. 80.</ref>  The ''Guide'' ran to five editions during Wordsworth's lifetime and proved to be very popular. Indeed, it has been said that \"the architectural axioms of building and gardening in the Lake District for the next hundred years were established by the ''Guide''\".<ref name=\"Albert Museum 1984, p.80\"/>\n\nFor other writers, the region's pull was more uncertain. [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]] followed Wordsworth to the Lakes and moved into [[Greta Hall]] in 1800. Although identified by his contemporaries as a 'Lake Poet', Coleridge's response to the landscape was at variance with the vision of Wordsworth, leading Coleridge to identify the landscape's \"Gothic elements\"...\"and in so doing seems to recognise a potential for psychological horror rather than solace.\" <ref>Bradshaw (2011), p. 67.</ref> Wordsworth's rejection of the poem [[Christabel (poem)|Christabel]], partly written at [[Greta Hall]], for the [[Lyrical Ballads]] collection, added to Coleridge's depression over his personal life, his doubts about being able to write as he would have wished and his ill-health which was made worse by the Cumbrian climate. This led him to resort to the [[Kendal Black Drop]], making matters desperate.  Coleridge moved out of the area in 1804. \n[[File:Greta Hall.jpg|thumb|left|Greta Hall, Keswick - home of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, 1800-1804; home to Robert Southey, 1803-1843]]\n\n[[Robert Southey]], it has been argued, although becoming identified as the central 'Lake Poet' (he lived at Greta Hall from 1803 to 1843), was mostly a prose writer and did not particularly subscribe to the Wordsworthian vision of the Lakes.<ref>Bradshaw (2011), pp. 68-69.</ref> Southey, like Wordsworth, started out on the republican left, but, by the time the threat from Napoleon had dwindled, he had become the embodiment of a [[Tory]] extolling the virtues of nation and patriotism, and using the Lakes as a touchstone, and as \"the symbol of the nation's covenant with God.\" <ref>Bradshaw (2011), p. 69.</ref>\n\n{{wikisource|Letitia Elizabeth Landon (L. E. L.) in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1834/Grasmere Lake|'Grasmere Lake, A Sketch by a Cockney,' by L. E. L.}}\n[[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]]'s sketch, ''Grasmere Lake, A Sketch by a Cockney'', in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1834, is a spoof on the Lake Poets, whom she admired (especially Wordsworth) but regarded as outmoded. In her view the days of Romanticism were over.\n\n==Associated writers==\nThe second generation of Romantic poets were drawn to the area by the Romantic vision of seclusion and by the perceived republican views of the older poets, but found a different reality when they arrived. [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]] lived for three months in 1811 at Keswick, having been drawn to the Lakes by reading the early, \"liberty and equality\" Southey, only to find that Southey's views had changed and that the Lakes had been despoiled by \"the manufacturers.\" \n\n[[John Keats|Keats]], in the Summer of 1818, had a similar response to that of Shelley, finding his hero's house full of fashionable people and Wordsworth himself away canvassing for the local Tory candidate. Keats moved on to Scotland which provided him with the inspiration he sought (and where, in particular, he felt the influence of [[Robert Burns]]). \n\n[[Lord Byron|Byron]] did not visit the Lakes, but he ridiculed the isolation and narrowness of mind of the older Lake Poets, as well as of their abandonment of radical politics.<ref>Bradshaw (2011), pp. 72-74</ref>\n\nThe hale and hearty [[John Wilson (Scottish writer)|John Wilson]] provided an alternative take on the role of Lake Poet. He lived near [[Windermere]] between 1808 and 1815 and knew the older Lake Poet trio well. His poetry (''Isle of Palms'') reveals a physical response to the Lakes scenery (he was an energetic walker and climber), and emphasises companionship and energy as against Wordsworthian quiet and solitude.<ref>Bradshaw (2011), pp. 74-77</ref>\n\nWilson knew both [[Harriet Martineau]] and [[Thomas De Quincey]]. Martineau settled in a house she had built near Ambleside in 1845. As befitted her [[sociology]]-based background, her views concentrated on the need for the Lakes to be connected more with the outside world (for example, she was in favour of improved sanitation and of the new railways being set up through the district, unlike her friend Wordsworth).  Her guide to the Lakes (''Complete guide to the Lakes'', 1855) was a rather factual and clear-eyed description about what to find there and about the condition of the people.<ref>Thompson (2010), pp. 191-195</ref><ref>Nicholson (1995), pp. 171-176</ref>\n\nDe Quincey moved into [[Dove Cottage]] in 1809 after having met his hero Wordsworth a couple of times before at [[Allan Bank]], where the Wordsworths lived during 1808-1811, and then at [[Rydal Mount]] (''[[Recollections of the Lake Poets]]'', edited essays, 1834-1840). His worship of Wordsworth turned sour after De Quincey married a local girl and the Wordsworths refused to meet her. Instead, according to Nicholson, he turned more to the local dalesfolk and \"he got to know the dalesmen ''as people, as persons'', better than ever Wordsworth did.\" <ref>Nicholson (1995), p. 131</ref> He reversed the practice of the Picturesque - instead of using the imagination to transform (and distort) the real, external world, he used the external world of the Lakes to feed his dreams and imagination.<ref>Nicholson (1995), pp. 135-139</ref>\n\n==Other writers==\nThe beauty of the Lake District has also inspired many other writers over the years, beyond the core Lake Poets.
