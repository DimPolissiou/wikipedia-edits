{"title_page": "Riddles (Arabic)", "text_new": "{{Arab culture}}\n\n'''Riddles''' are historically a significant genre of Arabic verse, and extensive scholarly collections have also been made of riddles in oral circulation in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Analysis of this literary form has, however, been neglected by modern scholars.<ref>Cf. A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, ''Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry'' (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), 14-18.</ref>\n\n==Terminology==\n\nRiddles are known in Arabic principally as ''lughz'' ({{lang-ar|\u0644\u064f\u063a\u0632}}) (pl. ''algh\u0101z'' \u0623\u0644\u063a\u0627\u0632), but other terms include ''u\u1e25jiyya'' (pl. ''a\u1e25\u0101j\u012b''), and ''ta'miya''.<ref>G. J. H. van Gelder, 'lughz', in ''Encyclopedia of Arabic Literature'', ed. by Julie Scott Meisami and Paul Starkey, 2 vols (London: Routledge, 1998), II 479.</ref> The term ''mu\u2018amm\u0101'' (literally 'blinded' or 'obscured') is sometimes used as a synonym for ''lughz'' (or to denote cryptography or codes more generally), but it can be used specifically to denote a riddle which is solved 'by combining the constituent letters of the word or name to be found'.<ref>G. J. H. van Gelder, 'mu\u2018amm\u0101', in ''Encyclopedia of Arabic Literature'', ed. by Julie Scott Meisami and Paul Starkey, 2 vols (London: Routledge, 1998), II 534.</ref>\n\n''Lughz'' is a capacious term.<ref>Smoor, Pieter, 'The Weeping Wax Candle and Ma\u2018arr\u012b's Wisdom-tooth: Night Thoughts and Riddles from the G\u0101mi\u2018 al-awz\u0101n', ''Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl\u00e4ndischen Gesellschaft'', 138 (1988), 283-312, https://www.jstor.org/stable/43377840.</ref> As [[al-Nuwayri|al-Nuwayr\u012b]] (1272\u20131332) puts it in the chapter on ''algh\u0101z'' and ''a\u1e25\u0101j\u012b'' in his ''Nih\u0101yat al-arab f\u012b fun\u016bn al-adab'':\n<blockquote>''Lughz'' is thought to derive from the phrase ''alghaza \u2019l-yarb\u016b\u2018u wa-laghaza'', which described the action of a field rat when it burrows its way first straight ahead but then veers off to the left or right in order to more successfully elude its enemies (''li-yuw\u0101riya bi-dh\u0101lika'') so that it becomes, as it were, almost invisible (''wa-yu\u2018ammiya \u2018al\u0101 \u1e6d\u0101libih\u012b''). But in fact our language also has many other names of ''lughz'' such as ''mu\u2019\u0101y\u0101h'', ''\u2019aw\u012b\u1e63'', ''ramz'', ''mu\u1e25\u0101g\u0101h'', ''aby\u0101t al-ma\u2019\u0101n\u012b'', ''mal\u0101\u1e25in'', ''marm\u016bs'', ''ta\u2019w\u012bl'', ''kin\u0101yah'', ''ta\u2018r\u012bd'', ''ish\u0101rah'', ''tawg\u012bh'', ''mu\u2018amm\u0101'', ''mumaththal''. Although each of these terms is used more or less interchangeably for ''lughz'', the very fact that there are so many of them is indicative of the varied explanations which the concept of ''lughz'' can apparently support.<ref>Smoor, Pieter, 'The Weeping Wax Candle and Ma\u2018arr\u012b's Wisdom-tooth: Night Thoughts and Riddles from the G\u0101mi\u2018 al-awz\u0101n', ''Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl\u00e4ndischen Gesellschaft'', 138 (1988), 283-312 (pp. 283--84), https://www.jstor.org/stable/43377840.</ref></blockquote>\nThis array of terms goes beyond those covered by ''riddle'' in English, into metaphor, ambiguity, and punning, indicating the fuzzy boundaries of the concept of the riddle in literary Arabic culture.<ref>Smoor, Pieter, 'The Weeping Wax Candle and Ma\u2018arr\u012b's Wisdom-tooth: Night Thoughts and Riddles from the G\u0101mi\u2018 al-awz\u0101n', ''Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl\u00e4ndischen Gesellschaft'', 138 (1988), 283-312 (p. 284), https://www.jstor.org/stable/43377840.</ref>\n\n==Early attestations==\n\nAs of 2011, 'the emergence of the Arabic literary riddle needs yet to be studied'.<ref>Nefeli Papoutsakis, ''Desert Travel as a Form of Boasting: A Study of D\u0332\u016b r-Rumma's Poetry'', Arabische Studien, 4 (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 2009), p. 19; cf. the 2011 article Nefeli Papoutsakis, 'Dh\u016b l-Rumma', in ''Encyclop\u00e6dia of Islam, THREE'', ed. by Kate Fleet and others (Leiden: Brilll, 2007-), s.v.

The earlier poets, like [[Ibn al-R\u016bmi]], [[al-Sar\u012b al-Raff\u0101\u2019]] and [[Mutanabb\u012b]] composed riddle poems of the 'narrow' kind, i.e. without the use of helpful homonyms ... [[Al-Ma\u02bfarri|Abu \u2019l-\u2018Al\u0101\u2019]]'s practise, however, tended toward the reverse: in his work 'narrow' riddles have become comparatively rare ... while homonymous riddles are quite common.<ref>Pieter Smoor, 'The Weeping Wax Candle and Ma\u2018arr\u012b's Wisdom-tooth: Night Thoughts and Riddles from the G\u0101mi\u2018 al-awz\u0101n', ''Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl\u00e4ndischen Gesellschaft'', 138 (1988), 283-312 (p. 309), https://www.jstor.org/stable/43377840.</ref></blockquote>\nSince early Arabic poetry often features rich, metaphorical description, and [[ekphrasis]], there is a natural overlap in style and approach between poetry generally and riddles specifically;<ref>G.

Among the diverse subjects covered by riddles in this period, the [[Writing-riddle#Pen riddles|pen]] was particularly popular in this period: the ''Dhakh\u012brah'' of [[Ibn Bass\u0101m]] (1058-1147), for example, presents examples by Ibn Khaf\u0101jah, Ibn al-Mu\u2018tazz, Abu Tamm\u0101m and Ibn al-R\u016bm\u012b and al-Ma\u2018arr\u012b.<ref>\u02bcAb\u012b \u02bcal-\u1e24asan \u02bbAl\u012b ibn Bass\u0101m \u02bcal-Shantar\u012bn\u012b., ''\u02bcal-Dhakh\u012brah f\u012b ma\u1e25\u0101sin ahl \u02bcal-Jaz\u012brah'', ed. by I\u1e25s\u0101n \u02bbAbb\u0101s, 4 vols in 8 (Bayr\u016bt: D\u0101r \u02bcal-Thaq\u0101fah, 1978), III: II, pp. 580ff.</ref> Musical instruments are another popular topic.<ref>Yaron Klein, '[https://www.academia.edu/828325 Musical instruments as objects of meaning in classical Arabic_poetry and philosophy]' (unpublished Ph.D. dissertation, Harvard University, 2009), pp. 83-99.</ref>\n\nRiddles were also discussed by literary commentators, prominently including [[Ibn Athir#Diy\u0101' ad-D\u012bn|\u1e0ciy\u0101\u02be al-D\u012bn Abu \u2019l-Fat\u1e25 Na\u1e63r All\u0101h Ibn al-Ath\u012br]]'s ''al-Mathal al-s\u0101\u02beir'' (chapter 21).

This mode is a plot-driven, [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[beat 'em up]] featuring computer-generated [[cut scene]]s.

The characters in ''Brawl'' include most of the same ones as the predecessors, such as [[Mario]] and [[Pikachu]].

In addition to basic attacks, characters have access to more powerful moves, known as smash attacks. Each character has four unique moves, which often cause effects besides damage to an opponent. ''Brawl'' introduces character-specific [[super (fighting games)|super attacks]], referred to as \"Final Smashes\". Significantly more powerful than regular attacks, these moves have a wide variety of effects that range from nearly unavoidable blasts to temporary transformations.

In this world, when a fighter is defeated, they become a trophy which can be revived by touching the base. Suddenly, the Battleship Halberd appears, releasing a stream of black, purple-clouded Shadow Bugs that form the soldiers of the Subspace Army. The Ancient Minister, the cloaked, mysterious Subspace General, arrives and detonates a Subspace Bomb, which can only be detonated by the sacrifice of two [[R.O.B]] units, and transports the stadium into Subspace, an alternate dimension where the Subspace Army resides. The Ancient Minister's advance prompts the heroes to ally and attempt to repel the enemy, while villains harvest the power of the allied characters by using dark cannons to convert them into trophies and using Shadow Bugs on some of them to create powerful doppelg\u00e4ngers. [[King Dedede]] begins independently gathering some fallen fighters' trophies, placing golden brooches on them.\n\nThe Ancient Minister is revealed as a subordinate to [[Ganon]]dorf, [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]], and [[Wario]], who are under orders from [[Master Hand]] to draw the world into Subspace. Wario, who had stolen [[Ness (character)|Ness]] with his dark cannon, is turned into a trophy by a [[List of Pok\u00e9mon characters#Player Characters|Pok\u00e9mon Trainer]] and [[Lucas (Mother 3)|Lucas]], and is then helplessly sucked in by a Subspace Bomb. Meanwhile, [[Meta Knight]] leaves his group to reclaim his stolen ship, the Halberd. He allies with [[Lucario]] and [[Solid Snake|Snake]], reaching the cockpit and destroying the Mr. Game & Watch clones piloting the battleship.\n\nThe Ancient Minister's true identity is found to be that of the Master R.O.B. unit, who rebels against Ganondorf to join the allied characters. Bowser and Ganondorf detonate several bombs on their Isle of the Ancients base to create a subspace portal large enough to summon their Subspace Gunship weapon. The three major groups converge and use the Halberd to battle the Gunship. Although the Halberd is destroyed, all of the characters escape unscathed and Ganondorf and Bowser retreat after Kirby destroys the Gunship with his Dragoon. Ganondorf betrays Bowser and turns him into a trophy, only to learn that Master Hand was being manipulated by the actual Subspace Army leader, Tabuu, who turns Ganondorf into a trophy and defeats Master Hand.\n\nThe allied characters enter Tabuu's chamber, but Tabuu annihilates them all with powerful \"Off Waves\" and scatters them all throughout Subspace.

Some are new, but others return from ''Melee''\u2014in some cases updated or refined, either in appearance, fighting capabilities, or both. For example, [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]] and [[Fox McCloud|Fox]] have adopted designs from more recent titles, while [[Samus Aran|Samus]] has gained the ability to change into Zero Suit Samus. [[Dr. Mario]], [[Roy (Fire Emblem)|Roy]], [[Young Link]], [[Mewtwo]], and [[Pichu]] are the first characters to not return from a previous game, though they do appear as stickers and/or trophies.\n\nSome previously represented series have had more characters added to ''Brawl''. [[Diddy Kong]] from the [[Donkey Kong|''Donkey Kong'' series]], [[Ike (Fire Emblem)|Ike]] from the ''[[Fire Emblem]]'' series, and [[Lucas (Mother 3)|Lucas]] from the ''[[EarthBound (series)|EarthBound]]'' series make their first appearance in the ''Smash Bros.'' series. Other newcomers are the first to represent their series. These include characters such as [[Pit (Kid Icarus)|Pit]], representing the ''[[Kid Icarus (series)|Kid Icarus]]'' series for the first time since the 1991 [[Game Boy]] game ''[[Kid Icarus: Of Myths and Monsters]]'', [[Captain Olimar|Olimar]] of the ''[[Pikmin (series)|Pikmin]]'' series, Lucario from ''[[Pokemon: Diamond and Pearl]]'', and [[Wario]], as he appears in Nintendo's ''[[WarioWare (series)|WarioWare]]''. [[Solid Snake]], the protagonist of [[Konami]]'s ''[[Metal Gear]]'' franchise, and [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]] from Nintendo's former rival [[Sega]] are the first third-party characters to appear in a ''Super Smash Bros.'' game.\n\n== Stages ==\n''Brawl''{{'}}s stages are generally based on plot devices from the various game series of ''Super Smash Bros.'' Stages range from floating platforms to moving areas where the characters must stay within the field of play. Each stage has a boundary that cannot be passed, or the character will be \"KO'd\", thus losing a life or \"point\", depending on the mode of play.\n\n''Brawl'' contains 41&nbsp;selectable stages, 29 of which are initially available.

The characters in ''Brawl'' include most of the same ones as the predecessors, such as [[Mario]] and [[Pikachu]].

In addition to basic attacks, characters have access to more powerful moves, known as smash attacks. Each character has four unique moves, which often cause effects besides damage to an opponent. ''Brawl'' introduces character-specific [[super (fighting games)|super attacks]], referred to as \"Final Smashes\". Significantly more powerful than regular attacks, these moves have a wide variety of effects that range from nearly unavoidable blasts to temporary transformations.

In this world, when a fighter is defeated, they become a trophy which can be revived by touching the base. Suddenly, the Battleship Halberd appears, releasing a stream of black, purple-clouded Shadow Bugs that form the soldiers of the Subspace Army. The Ancient Minister, the cloaked, mysterious Subspace General, arrives and detonates a Subspace Bomb, which can only be detonated by the sacrifice of two [[R.O.B]] units, and transports the stadium into Subspace, an alternate dimension where the Subspace Army resides. The Ancient Minister's advance prompts the heroes to ally and attempt to repel the enemy, while villains harvest the power of the allied characters by using dark cannons to convert them into trophies and using Shadow Bugs on some of them to create powerful doppelg\u00e4ngers. [[King Dedede]] begins independently gathering some fallen fighters' trophies, placing golden brooches on them.\n\nThe Ancient Minister is revealed as a subordinate to [[Ganon]]dorf, [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]], and [[Wario]], who are under orders from [[Master Hand]] to draw the world into Subspace. Wario, who had stolen [[Ness (character)|Ness]] with his dark cannon, is turned into a trophy by a [[List of Pok\u00e9mon characters#Player Characters|Pok\u00e9mon Trainer]] and [[Lucas (Mother 3)|Lucas]], and is then helplessly sucked in by a Subspace Bomb. Meanwhile, [[Meta Knight]] leaves his group to reclaim his stolen ship, the Halberd. He allies with [[Lucario]] and [[Solid Snake|Snake]], reaching the cockpit and destroying the Mr. Game & Watch clones piloting the battleship.\n\nThe Ancient Minister's true identity is found to be that of the Master R.O.B. unit, who rebels against Ganondorf to join the allied characters. Bowser and Ganondorf detonate several bombs on their Isle of the Ancients base to create a subspace portal large enough to summon their Subspace Gunship weapon. The three major groups converge and use the Halberd to battle the Gunship. Although the Halberd is destroyed, all of the characters escape unscathed and Ganondorf and Bowser retreat after Kirby destroys the Gunship with his Dragoon. Ganondorf betrays Bowser and turns him into a trophy, only to learn that Master Hand was being manipulated by the actual Subspace Army leader, Tabuu, who turns Ganondorf into a trophy and defeats Master Hand.\n\nThe allied characters enter Tabuu's chamber, but Tabuu annihilates them all with powerful \"Off Waves\" and scatters them all throughout Subspace.

Some are new, but others return from ''Melee''\u2014in some cases updated or refined, either in appearance, fighting capabilities, or both. For example, [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]] and [[Fox McCloud|Fox]] have adopted designs from more recent titles, while [[Samus Aran|Samus]] has gained the ability to change into Zero Suit Samus. [[Dr. Mario]], [[Roy (Fire Emblem)|Roy]], [[Young Link]], [[Mewtwo]], and [[Pichu]] are the first characters to not return from a previous game, though they do appear as stickers and/or trophies.\n\nSome previously represented series have had more characters added to ''Brawl''. [[Diddy Kong]] from the [[Donkey Kong|''Donkey Kong'' series]], [[Ike (Fire Emblem)|Ike]] from the ''[[Fire Emblem]]'' series, and [[Lucas (Mother 3)|Lucas]] from the ''[[EarthBound (series)|EarthBound]]'' series make their first appearance in the ''Smash Bros.'' series. Other newcomers are the first to represent their series. These include characters such as [[Pit (Kid Icarus)|Pit]], representing the ''[[Kid Icarus (series)|Kid Icarus]]'' series for the first time since the 1991 [[Game Boy]] game ''[[Kid Icarus: Of Myths and Monsters]]'', [[Captain Olimar|Olimar]] of the ''[[Pikmin (series)|Pikmin]]'' series, Lucario from ''[[Pokemon: Diamond and Pearl]]'', and [[Wario]], as he appears in Nintendo's ''[[WarioWare (series)|WarioWare]]''. [[Solid Snake]], the protagonist of [[Konami]]'s ''[[Metal Gear]]'' franchise, and [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]] from Nintendo's former rival [[Sega]] are the first third-party characters to appear in a ''Super Smash Bros.'' game.\n\n== Stages ==\n''Brawl''{{'}}s stages are generally based on plot devices from the various game series of ''Super Smash Bros.'' Stages range from floating platforms to moving areas where the characters must stay within the field of play. Each stage has a boundary that cannot be passed, or the character will be \"KO'd\", thus losing a life or \"point\", depending on the mode of play.\n\n''Brawl'' contains 41&nbsp;selectable stages, 29 of which are initially available.

She passed [[SSLC]] (Secondary School Leaving Certificate) examination in 1955. She could not continue her studies because her parents could not financially afford to send her to a far-off college.<ref>[http://ranganayakamma.org/biography.htm Political Biography of Ranganayakamma]</ref>\n\nHer marriage was a [[Arranged marriage in the Indian subcontinent|traditionally arranged]] one. Due to contradictions, she left the first marriage after 12 years (1958-1970) and came to be known as \"Ranganayakamma\" (\"Muppala\" was the surname of her first husband).\n    \nShe has been writing since 1955. To date, she has written about 15 novels, 70 short stories, and many essays.  She published about 60 volumes in all. The main theme in her works is [[gender equality]] and the depiction of women's family life in India.\n\nShe came into contact with Marxism in 1973 and began to write from that perspective since then. \nShe is best known for her work ''Ramayana Vishavruksham'' (meaning \"''Ramayana: The Poisonous Tree''\"), published in 1974, criticizing the Hindu epic ''[[Ramayana]]'' from Marxist point of view. This book was a three volume series and is now (since March 2005) available as a single volume with 746 pages in Royal size. This book is now (since August 2004) available in English. According to an article featured on her own website, she \"receives letters from readers saying that they have converted into [[Rationalism|rationalists]] and Marxists after reading [''Ramayana Vishavruksham''].\"<ref>[http://ranganayakamma.org/Two%20Reports%20on%20vishavruksham.htm Ramanya Rapper Sells in Andhra]</ref>\n\nAnother important writing of hers is the ''Marx Capital parichayam'', an introduction to [[Karl Marx|Marx]]'s ''[[Das Kapital]]'' in 3 volumes.

The main theme in her works is [[gender equality]] and the depiction of women's family life in India.\n\nShe came into contact with Marxism in 1973 and began to write from that perspective since then. \nShe is best known for her work ''Ramayana Vishavruksham'' (meaning \"''Ramayana: The Poisonous Tree''\"), published in 1974, criticizing the Hindu epic ''[[Ramayana]]'' from Marxist point of view. This book was a three volume series and is now (since March 2005) available as a single volume with 746 pages in Royal size. This book is now (since August 2004) available in English.

Their efforts focus primarily on medical research to identify genetic and environmental risk factors in autism. Those who favour the neurodiversity paradigm, which aligns with the [[social model of disability]], see autism as a naturally-occurring variation in the brain.

Children with AS are often the target of [[bullying]] at school due to their [[Idiosyncrasy|idiosyncratic]] behavior, precise language, unusual interests, and impaired ability to perceive and respond in socially expected ways to [[Nonverbal communication|nonverbal]] cues, particularly in interpersonal conflict, which results in them being sought out by classmates and [[Social rejection|rejected]]. People with AS may be overly literal and may have difficulty interpreting and responding to [[sarcasm]], [[banter]], or [[metaphor]]ical speech. Difficulties with social interaction may also manifest in a lack of play with other children.<ref name=Attwood-p58>{{cite book|last=Attwood|first=Tony|title=The Complete Guide to Asperger's Syndrome|year=2007|publisher=Jessica Kingsley|location=London|page=58}}</ref>\n\nThe above problems can even arise in the family; given an unfavorable family environment, the child may be subject to [[Psychological abuse|emotional abuse]]. A child, teen, or adult with AS is often puzzled by this mistreatment, unaware of what has been done incorrectly. Unlike with other [[Pervasive developmental disorder|pervasive development disorders]], most persons with AS want to be social, but fail to socialize successfully, which can lead to later withdrawal and asocial behavior, especially in adolescence.<ref>Stoddart, Kevin P. (Editor) (2005), p. 22.</ref> At this stage of life especially, they risk being drawn into unsuitable and inappropriate friendships and social groups. People with AS often interact better with those considerably older or younger than themselves, rather than those within their own age group.<ref name=Attwood-p58 />\n\nChildren with AS often display advanced abilities for their age in language, [[reading]], [[mathematics]], [[Space|spatial skills]], or music\u2014sometimes into the \"gifted\" range\u2014but this may be counterbalanced by considerable delays in other developmental areas, like [[communication|verbal]] and [[nonverbal communication]] or some lack of [[motor coordination]]. This combination of traits can lead to problems with teachers and other [[Authority|authority figures]]. A child with AS might be regarded by teachers as a \"problem child\" or a \"poor performer.\" The child's extremely low tolerance for what they perceive to be ordinary and mundane tasks, such as typical homework assignments, can easily become frustrating; a teacher may well consider the child arrogant, spiteful, and [[Insubordination|insubordinate]]. Lack of support and understanding, in combination with the child's anxieties, can result in problematic behavior (such as severe tantrums, violent and angry outbursts, and withdrawal).<ref>Myles, Brenda Smith; Southwick, Jack (2005). \"Asperger Syndrome and Difficult Moments\".

The impaired social skills can be likely to interfere with the interview process\u2014and people with often superior skills can be passed over due to these conflicts with interviewers.

Those who favour the neurodiversity paradigm, which aligns with the [[social model of disability]], see autism as a naturally-occurring variation in the brain. Neurodiversity advocates argue that efforts to eliminate autism should not be compared, for example, to curing cancer, but instead to the antiquated notion of curing [[left-handedness]].

People with AS may be overly literal and may have difficulty interpreting and responding to [[sarcasm]], [[banter]], or [[metaphor]]ical speech. Difficulties with social interaction may also manifest in a lack of play with other children.<ref name=Attwood-p58>{{cite book|last=Attwood|first=Tony|title=The Complete Guide to Asperger's Syndrome|year=2007|publisher=Jessica Kingsley|location=London|page=58}}</ref>\n\nThe above problems can even arise in the family; given an unfavorable family environment, the child may be subject to [[Psychological abuse|emotional abuse]]. A child, teen, or adult with AS is often puzzled by this mistreatment, unaware of what has been done incorrectly. Unlike with other [[Pervasive developmental disorder|pervasive development disorders]], most persons with AS want to be social, but fail to socialize successfully, which can lead to later withdrawal and asocial behavior, especially in adolescence.<ref>Stoddart, Kevin P. (Editor) (2005), p. 22.</ref> At this stage of life especially, they risk being drawn into unsuitable and inappropriate friendships and social groups. People with AS often interact better with those considerably older or younger than themselves, rather than those within their own age group.<ref name=Attwood-p58 />\n\nChildren with AS often display advanced abilities for their age in language, [[reading]], [[mathematics]], [[Space|spatial skills]], or music\u2014sometimes into the \"gifted\" range\u2014but this may be counterbalanced by considerable delays in other developmental areas, like [[communication|verbal]] and [[nonverbal communication]] or some lack of [[motor coordination]]. This combination of traits can lead to problems with teachers and other [[Authority|authority figures]]. A child with AS might be regarded by teachers as a \"problem child\" or a \"poor performer.\" The child's extremely low tolerance for what they perceive to be ordinary and mundane tasks, such as typical homework assignments, can easily become frustrating; a teacher may well consider the child arrogant, spiteful, and [[Insubordination|insubordinate]]. Lack of support and understanding, in combination with the child's anxieties, can result in problematic behavior (such as severe tantrums, violent and angry outbursts, and withdrawal).<ref>Myles, Brenda Smith; Southwick, Jack (2005). \"Asperger Syndrome and Difficult Moments\".

The impaired social skills can be likely to interfere with the interview process\u2014and people with often superior skills can be passed over due to these conflicts with interviewers.

They may have difficulty finding a life partner or getting married due to poor social skills.<ref name=Tsatsanis/> The complexity and inconsistency of the social world can pose an extreme challenge for individuals with AS.

{"title_page": "Center for Functional Nanomaterials", "text_new": "{{Third-party|date=February 2020}}\n[[Image:CFN-600px.jpg|thumb|300px| The CFN at Brookhaven National Laboratory]]\n\nThe '''Center for Functional Nanomaterials''' is a science [[laboratory]] specializing in [[nanoscale]] research. It is housed within [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] on [[Long Island]], [[New York State]].\n\n== Overview ==\nThe CFN provides capabilities for the fabrication and study of nanoscale materials, with an emphasis on atomic-level tailoring to achieve desired properties and functions. The CFN is a science-based user facility, simultaneously developing scientific programs while offering access to its capabilities and collaboration through an active user program. \n\nThe CFN is funded by the [[Department of Energy (United States)|Department of Energy]]'s Office of Science. \n\n==Scientific themes==\nThe science at the CFN is organized around these scientific themes: \n\n* Electronic Nanomaterials; \n* Interface Science and [[Catalysis]]; \n* [[Electron microscope|Electron Microscopy]]; \n* Soft and Biological Materials; \n* Theory and Computation.\n\nSome scientific highlights within these themes can be found at: https://www.bnl.gov/cfn/research/highlights/archives.php.\n\n==Research facilities==\nThe CFN is housed in a building consisting of offices and laboratories, located next to the [[National Synchrotron Light Source]] (NSLS). The facility contains five  groups of laboratories called Laboratory Facilities, a Theory and Computational Center, and a set of advanced endstations on beamlines at the NSLS. \n\nThe Laboratory Facilities include  capabilities in [[Nanolithography|nanopatterning]], [[transmission electron microscopy]], nanomaterials synthesis, ultrafast laser sources, and powerful probes to image atomic and molecular structure, together with clean rooms and other support instrumentation. Access is also offered to the Laser Electron Accelerator Facility (LEAF).\n\n==User program==\nThe CFN is operated as a national user facility, accessible to researchers at universities, and industrial and national laboratories through [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] proposals. The user program provides access to laboratory facilities staffed by scientists and technical support personnel who are active in nanoscience research.\n\n=== Modes of Access ===\n'''General Users''' are researchers or research group that use the CFN's facilities for non-proprietary research, after the submission of a proposal and its positive evaluation by an external Proposal Review Panel (PRP).\n\n'''Partner Users''' are General users who also enhance the facility capabilities and/or contribute to the Center operation. They typically help develop [[instrumentation]] in some manner, either by bringing external financial and/or [[intellectual capital]] into the development of the facility. These contributions must be made available to the General Users and, therefore, benefit the overall User Program as well as the facility.  Partner Users are provided negotiated access to one or more capabilities over a period of several years.\n\n'''Rapid Access''': Users who feel that the timeliness of their research may be negatively affected by the length of the whole proposal-review process can request Rapid Access. Proposals submitted for rapid access are reviewed and approved by the CFN Director, technically assisted, if necessary, by pertinent group or facility leaders. Besides being feasible at the CFN and scientifically important, proposals being considered for Rapid Access must include a justification of the time-sensitive nature of the project.\n\n==Proposal submission and review process==\nPrior to submitting a proposal, prospective users are encouraged to identify the appropriate CFN scientists and capabilities needed for their research project, and contact the CFN staff to confirm feasibility. Although not required, early discussion with CFN scientist(s) can help the prospective user understand the capabilities available, feasibility, safety & training issues, and level of effort required. There are three work cycles per year: January\u2013April, May\u2013August, and September\u2013December.\n\nAll user proposals undergo a feasibility/safety review by CFN staff. The prospective user is advised of any concerns/issues and offered the opportunity to revise the proposal, if appropriate, to resolve those issues/concerns. After the initial review, the proposals are sent to an external Proposal Review Panels (PRP). Each proposal is assigned to the most relevant panel, reviewed and scored by at least three panel members. Rapid access proposals are reviewed by the CFN Director. The PRP scores and comments are used by the Facility Leaders or designees to prioritize access to CFN. Prospective users are notified of the decision (accept/decline) and given the feedback comments from the PRP.\n\nOnce the proposal has been accepted, a User Agreement is executed (if none is in place). The prospective user schedules the facility time with the Facility Leader or designee, and conducts work. The user is expected to publish the results in the peer-reviewed literature. At the conclusion of the project, the user completes an End-of-Experiment Survey and reports related publications/presentations to the CFN. If the user needs to continue his project after the proposal expires in two years, he/she is required to submit a final project report before the new proposal is accepted.\n\nCFN users may conduct either non-proprietary (pre-competitive research to be published) or proprietary research. Prospective users must designate if any/all of their user proposal involves proprietary information and if any of the user project, if accepted, would be proprietary work. For proprietary work at the CFN, full-cost recovery is required and a proprietary research agreement (.pdf) must be in place prior to starting work. BNL makes efforts to secure appropriate intellectual property control so that proprietary-research users can exploit their experimental results.\n\nUpon acceptance of a user proposal for non-proprietary research, the user's institution is required to execute a nonproprietary user agreement. In addition to defining the terms & conditions for intellectual property created during the user project, the agreement confirms that the user will publish the results in the open technical literature in return for no-fee access to the CFN. \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.bnl.gov/cfn CFN Website]\n* [http://www.bnl.gov/cfn/people CFN Staff List]\n\n\n[[Category:United States Department of Energy]]\n[[Category:Brookhaven National Laboratory]]\n[[Category:Nanoscale Science Research Centers]]\n", "text_old": "{{Third-party|date=February 2020}}\n[[Image:CFN-600px.jpg|thumb|300px| The CFN at Brookhaven National Laboratory]]\n\nThe '''Center for Functional Nanomaterials''' is a science [[laboratory]] specializing in [[nanoscale]] research at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] on [[Long Island]], [[New York State]].\n\n== Overview ==\nThe CFN provides capabilities for the fabrication and study of nanoscale materials, with an emphasis on atomic-level tailoring to achieve desired properties and functions.
