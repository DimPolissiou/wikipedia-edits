Primary sources including the ''[[Sirah Rasul Allah]]'' (Biography of the Prophet) of Ibn Ishaq describe the conquest of Khaybar, detailing the agreement of Muhammad with the Jews to remain in Fadak and cultivate their land, retaining one-half of the produce of the oasis.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20040625103910/http://www.hraic.org/hadith/ibn_ishaq.html#khaybar#khaybar Sirat Rasulullah, Chapter 'Khaybar']</ref> This agreement was distinct from the agreement with the Jews of Khaybar, which essentially entailed the practice of [[sharecropping]]. Muhammad retained the revenues of the Fadak region for the poor as ''\u1e63adaqa'', travelers in need, and for his family. \nIt is not entirely clear how Muhammad managed his possession of Fadak. [[Ibn Taimiyya]] wrote in his [[Minhaj as-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah|Minhaj al-Sunnah]] that Muhammad appointed [[Amr ibn al-As]] as the governor of the Khaybar [[oasis]]<ref>[[Minhaj as-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah]] by [[Ibn Taimiyya]], volume 4 page 460</ref> \nFollowing the death of Muhammad, scholars disagreed as to whether Fadak was exclusively his property.\nSome Muslim commentators agree that following the conquest of Fadak, the property belonged exclusively to Muhammad, while several others reject this view.<ref name=\"Taymiyyah\">A Shah Waliullah in [[Quratul Ain]] p228 and [[Ibn Taymiyyah]] in [[Minhaj as-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah|Minhaj al-Sunnah]], Dhikr of Fadak</ref>  Various primary sources describe the acquisition of Fadak in the following way: \n<blockquote>\nHalf the Land of Fadak, which was given by Jews after the peace treaty, was purely the property of Rasool Allah (s).

The Banu an-Nadir property was kept for his emergent needs, Fadak for travellers, and Khaybar was divided by the Apostle of Allah into three sections: two for Muslims, and one as a contribution for his family.

When asked by Muhammad, who the \"Dhul Qurba\" referred to, Gabriel replied \"Fatima\" and that by \"rights\" was meant \"Fadak\", upon which Muhammad called Fatima and presented Fadak to her.<ref>*[[Ruzatul Safa]] as quoted in [[Tashdheed-ul-Mathaeen]] page 102.</ref>\n\nBesides the above Quranic verses, there some authenticated references for this issue. For example, [[Burhan al-Din al-Marghinani|Ali Ibn Burhanu'd-din Halabi Shafi'i]] writes in his [[Sirat al-Halbiya|Siratu'l-Halabiyya]], p.&nbsp;39 that at first Fatimah complained to Abu Bakr about the fact that she was given the fadak as a gift by the prophet of Islam, as the witnesses were unavailable she was forced to allege her right based on the inheritance law. Also it is mentioned in [[Mu'jam Al-Buldan]] of [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]], [[Tafsir al-Kabir (al-Razi)|Tafsir al-Kabir]] of [[Fakhr ad-Din ar-Razi|Imam Fakhru'd-din Razi]], [[Al-Sawa'iq al-Muhriqah|Sawa'iq al-Muhriqa]] of [[Ibn Hajar al-Haytami|Ibn Hajar]] p.&nbsp;21, [[Comments on the Peak of Eloquence (Ibn Abi al-Hadid)|Sharh al-Nahju'l-Balagha]] of [[Izz al-Din ibn Hibatullah ibn Abi l-Hadid|Ibn Abi'l-Hadid Mu'tazali]] Vol 4, p.&nbsp;80 that Fatima firstly claimed she was given the fadak as a gift but they rejected her witnesses and she suffered and angrily said that she would not talk to [[Abu Bakr]] and [[Umar]] again.<ref>[http://www.al-islam.org/peshawar-nights-sultan-al-waadhim-sayyid-muhammad-al-musawi-ash-shirazi/eighth-session-thursday#fadak-was-gift-not-legacy Peshawar Nights, Sultan al-Wa\u2019adhim As-Sayyid Muhammad al-Musawi ash-Shirazi]</ref>\n\n=== After the death of Muhammad ===\n[[Lesley Hazleton]] describes the dispute between [[Fatimah]] and [[Abu Bakr]] as follows: \u00ab[Fatimah] sent a message to Abu Bakr asking for her share of her father's estate -date palm orchards in the huge oases of Khaybar and Fadak to the north of Medina. His response left her dumbfounded. Muhammad's estate belonged to the community, not to any individual, Abu Bakr replied. It was part of the Muslim charitable trust to be administered by him as Caliph. [...] There was no denying the populist appeal of the message Abu Bakr sent by denying Fatima's claim: the House of Muhammad was the House of Islam, and all were equal within it.\u00bb<ref>After the Prophet: The Epic Story of the Shia-Sunni Split in Islam By Lesley Hazleton, pp. 71-73</ref>\n\nWhen [[Umar]] became Caliph, the value of the land of Fadak along with its dates was 50,000 dirhams.<ref name=\"Hadeed\"/> Ali again claimed Fatima's inheritance during Umar's era, but was denied with the same argument as in the time of Abu Bakr. Umar however, restored the estates in Medina to [[`Abbas ibn `Abd al-Muttalib]] and Ali, as representatives of Muhammad's clan, the [[Banu Hashim]]. \nDuring [[Uthman]]'s caliphate, [[Marwan I|Marwan ibn al-Hak\u00e2m]], who was his cousin, was made trustee of the Fadak.<ref>Wafa al Wafa (vol 3 p 1000), Tarikh Abu al-Fida (vol 1 p 168)</ref>\n\n=== Sunni view of Fadak ===\nAccording to Sunnis, Fadak was a piece of land, near Khaiber, where Jews lived. Fadak was conquered by Muhammad. The Qur'an says: \u201cAnd that which Allah gave as spoil unto His messenger from them, ye urged not any horse or riding-camel for the sake thereof, but Allah giveth His messenger lordship over whom He will. Allah is Able to do all things. That which Allah giveth as spoil unto His messenger from the people of the townships, it is for Allah and His messenger and for the near of kin and the orphans and the needy and the wayfarer, that it become not a commodity between the rich among you. And whatsoever the messenger giveth you, take it. And whatsoever he forbiddeth, abstain (from it). And keep your duty to Allah. Lo! Allah is stern in reprisal.  -(59: 6-7). Thus according to the Qur\u2019an, Fai means such of properties of the unbelievers as are returned to the Muslims without war. It is not to be distributed like booty among the soldiers, but the whole of it is for Allah and His apostle. From the Sunnah and Practice of the Prophet of Islam it is evident that Muhammad himself used to manage Fai as the head of the Islamic republic.<ref>http://www.muslimtents.com/shaufi/b16/b16_13.htm</ref>\n\nAccording to Sunnis, Muhammad didn't gift Fadak to his daughter. All the narrations regarding this are weak. As far as the claim of Shias is concerned, that when the verse of the Quran, \"And give the relative his right\",<ref>Quran, Surah Isra, verse 26</ref> was revealed, the Prophet gave Fadak to his daughter as it was her right.\nBut, there are several famous Sunni scholars who specify that the revelation of 17:26<ref>[http://tanzil.net/#trans/en.sahih/17:26 17:26]</ref> is about Fadak transmission from the Prophet to Fatima, such as: Razi,<ref>[Razi in the book \"Aljrh and Altdyl\" vol. 1, p. 257]</ref> Suyuti,<ref name=\"Suyuti p. 158\">[Suyuti (Vol. 2, p. 158 and vol. 5, pp.273_274)]</ref> Khwarizmi,<ref name=\"Suyuti p. 158\"/> Ali ibn Abd-al-Malik al-Hindi<ref>[Ali ibn Abd-al-Malik al-Hindi (vol. 2, p. 158 and vol. 3, p. 767)]</ref> and so on.\n\nFatimah However Agreed and Was Satisfied With The Decision of Abu Bakr after He Came to Fatimah's House and Discussed The Matter With Ali and Fatima.\nDarqutni,Ameer ul Mu'mineen Fil Hadith reports a narration From Umme Hani in his Al ilal,\n                           \"Umme Hani Told Fatimah Told Abu Bakr Told That The Holy Prophet Peace Be Upon him said That We Prophets Don't have \n                                                 inheritors, instead What we leave is Charity for the Ummah\"\n                                                         <ref>Darqutni,Al ilal ,1:231:34</ref>\nReporting of Fatimah the Hadith on the Authority of Abu Bakr Proves That She Was Satisfied.\n\n=== Fadak under the Umayyads (661 &ndash; 750) ===\n[[Mu'awiyah]], the first [[Ummayad|Umayyad Caliph]] did not return Fadak to [[Fatimah]]'s descendants. This way was continued by later [[Ummayad|Umayyad Caliphs]] until [[Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz]] seized power.\nWhen [[Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz]], known as [[Umar II]], became Caliph in 717 CE, the income from the property of Fadak was 40,000 dinars.<ref>[[Sunan Abu Dawud]], v3, p144, Dhikr Fa'y</ref> Fadak was returned to Fatima's descendants by an edict given by [[Umar II]],<ref>[[Wafa al-Wafa]], page 99</ref> but this decision was renounced by later caliphs.[[Umar II]]'s successor, [[Yazid II|Yazid ibn Abd al-Malik]] (known as [[Yazid II]]) overturned his decision, and Fadak was again made public trust. Fadak was then managed this way until the [[Ummayad Caliphate]] expired.\n\n=== Fadak under the Abbasids (750 &ndash; 1258) ===\nIn year 747 CE, a huge revolt against the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] occurred. The Umayyad's were eventually defeated by the [[Abbasid]] army under the rule of [[As-Saffah|Abu Abbas Abdullah al-Saffah]] (see [[Battle of the Zab]]) in year 750.

Both Marshall and Hedren saw a game warden's house in [[Zimbabwe]] overrun by lions, and learned about awareness for endangered animal and big cat species. The two conceived an idea for a film that the family could be a part of, which would center around many African cats.<ref name=\"gorongosa\">{{cite web | url=http://www.gorongosa.net/en/page/1969_Tippi_Hedren/1969--tippi-hedren | title=1969 \u2013 Tippi Hedren | work=gorongosa.net | publisher=Parque Nacional da Gorongosa | accessdate=December 1, 2008 | url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703153251/http://www.gorongosa.net/en/page/1969_Tippi_Hedren/1969--tippi-hedren|archivedate=3 July 2008}}</ref> Marshall wrote the script, and gave the film a [[working title]], which was ''Lions, Lions and More Lions''.<ref name=\"theawl\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theawl.com/2012/10/how-to-get-your-lion-back-when-it-runs-away-life-lessons-from-tippi-hedren/|title=How To Get Your Lion Back When It Runs Away: Life Lessons From Tippi Hedren|last=Frye|first=Carrie|work=[[The Awl]]|date=October 19, 2012|accessdate=March 31, 2019}}</ref> He also convinced Japanese and British investors to provide the funds for the movie.<ref name=\"Historybyday\"/> Marshall and Hedren approached animal trainers for support on the training of numerous big cats, and were told the idea was impossible, dismissing them both as \"brainsick\" and \"completely and utterly insane\" to allow big cats on-set without at least two experienced trainers for each animal.<ref name=\"bmd\">{{cite web|url=https://birthmoviesdeath.com/2015/02/19/utterly-brainsick-roar-starring-tippi-hedren-melanie-griffith-joins-pride-o|title=Utterly Terrifying ROAR, Starring Tippi Hedren And Melanie Griffith, Joins Pride Of Drafthouse Films|last=Stobezki|first=Jon|work=Birth.Movies.Death.|date=February 19, 2015|accessdate=March 30, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Historybyday\"/> Hedren originally wanted actor [[Jack Nicholson]] to play the role of biologist Hank, but Marshall himself took the role instead.<ref name=\"Historybyday\"/>\n\nProduction started in [[Santa Monica, California]], in 1976; shooting for the film was scheduled to last six months but took 3 years to shoot, and 11 years to make.<ref name=\"nypost\">{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2015/04/11/son-of-roar-director-he-was-a-f-ing-a-hole-for-making-us-do-the-movie/|title=Son of \u2018Roar\u2019 director: \u2018He was a f\u2014ing a\u2013hole\u2019 for making us do the movie|last=Lumenick|first=Lou|work=[[New York Post]]|date=April 11, 2015|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"grrrrrr\">{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/2015/04/15/roar-movie-tippi-hedren/|title=Fifty Shades of Grrrrrr: The insane story of 'Roar'|last=Collis|first=Clark|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=April 15, 2015|accessdate=March 31, 2019}}</ref> During that time, Marshall and his family began housing lions first at his [[Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles|Sherman Oaks]] home, a property he bought in Santa Clarita, and later in [[Acton, California]].<ref name=\"grantland\">{{cite web|url=http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/roar-making-of-lions-tigers/|title=\u2018We\u2019d All Been Bitten, and We Kept Coming Back\u2019: \u2018Roar\u2019 Star John Marshall on Making the Most Dangerous Movie of All Time|last=Pappademas|first=Alex|work=[[Grantland]]|date=April 17, 2015|accessdate=March 30, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"scv\">{{cite news | last=Worden | first=Leon | url=http://www.scvhistory.com/scvhistory/signal/newsmaker/sg030605.htm | title=SCV Newsmaker of the Week: Tippi Hedren | date=March 6, 2005 | work=scvhistory.com | publisher=SCV Press Club }}</ref> The animal cast eventually reached to 132 lions, tigers, leopards, cougars, and jaguars.<ref name=\"grrrrrr\"/> ''Roar'' was accident-ridden due to the injuries inflicted on the cast and crew that were caused by the animals.

Multiple incomplete but well-preserved specimens were discovered in the [[Gobi Desert]] in the 1970s, and in 1979 the genus and species '''''Segnosaurus galbinensis''''' were named. The generic name ''Segnosaurus'' means \"slow lizard\" and the specific name ''galbinensis'' refers to the [[Galbin]] region. The known material of this dinosaur includes the lower jaw, neck and tail vertebrae, the pelvis, shoulder girdle, and limb bones. Parts of the specimens have gone missing or become damaged since they were collected.\n\n''Segnosaurus'' was a large-bodied [[therizinosaur]] that is estimated to have been about {{convert|6\u20137|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and to have weighed about {{convert|1.3|MT|ST|abbr=on}}. It would have been bipedal, with the trunk of its body tilted upwards. The head was small with a beak at the tip of the jaws, and the neck was long and slender. The lower jaw was down-turned at the front and the teeth were distinct in having additional {{Dinogloss|denticles}} as well as third cutting edges in some of the hindmost teeth. The forelimbs were robust and had three fingers which bore large claws, and the feet had four toes supporting the foot\u2014apart from therizinosaurs, all [[theropods]] had three-toed feet. The front of the pelvis was adapted to support the enlarged belly. The [[pubic bone]] was turned backwards, a feature that is only seen in birds and the dinosaurs most closely related to them.\n\nThe affinities of ''Segnosaurus'' were originally obscure and it received its own theropod family, Segnosauridae, and later when related genera were identified, an [[infraorder]], Segnosauria. Alternative classification schemes were proposed until more complete relatives were described in the 1990s, which confirmed them as theropods. The new fossils also showed Segnosauridae was a [[junior synonym]] of the earlier named family Therizinosauridae. ''Segnosaurus'' and its relatives are thought to have been slow-moving animals that, as indicated by their unusual features, were mainly herbivorous, whereas most other theropod groups were carnivorous. Therizinosaurs probably used their long forelimbs, long necks, and beaks when [[Browsing (herbivory)|browsing]], and large guts for processing food. ''Segnosaurus'' is known from the [[Bayan Shireh Formation]], where it lived alongside the fellow therizinosaurs ''[[Erlikosaurus]]'' and ''[[Enigmosaurus]]''; these related genera were probably [[niche partitioned]].\n\n==History of discovery==\n[[File:Cretaceous-aged dinosaur fossil localities of Mongolia.PNG|thumb|left|upright=1.4|[[Cretaceous]]-aged dinosaur fossil localities of Mongolia; ''Segnosaurus'' was found by areas C and D (right, Amtgay and Khara-Khutul localities)]]\n\nIn 1973, a joint [[Soviet]]\u2013Mongolian expedition investigating the [[Bayan Shireh Formation]] at the Amtgay locality in the [[Gobi Desert]] of southeastern Mongolia discovered fossils that included the partial skeleton of an unknown [[dinosaur]]. Through 1974 and 1975, more remains were uncovered at the Amtgay and Khara-Khutul localities; though the skeletons were incomplete, the recovered bones were well-preserved. Other localities listed in the literature include Bayshin-Tsav and Urilbe-Khuduk. These fossils were scientifically [[species description|described]] in 1979 by the paleontologist [[Altangerel Perle]], who named the new [[genus]] and species ''Segnosaurus galbiensis''. The generic name is derived from the Latin word ''segnis'' (\"slow\") and the [[Ancient Greek]] ''sauros'' (\"lizard\"). The [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] refers to the [[Galbin]] region of the Gobi Desert.<ref name=\"Perle1979\">{{Cite journal |last=Perle |first=A. |author-link=Altangerel Perle |year=1979 |title=Segnosauridae \u2013 novoe semeistvo teropod is posdnego mela Mongolii |trans-title=Segnosauridae \u2013 a new family of Theropoda from the Lower Cretaceous of Mongolia |url=http://paleoglot.org/files/Perle%2079.pdf |url-status=live |journal=Trudy \u2013 Sovmestnaya Sovetsko-Mongol'skaya Paleontologicheskaya Ekspeditsiya |language=Russian |volume=8 |pages=45\u201355 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128221548/http://paleoglot.org/files/Perle%2079.pdf |archive-date=2012-11-28 |translator-last=Siskron |translator-first=C. |translator2-last=Welles |translator2-first=S.

Zanno also noted that by the time of her study, there were numerous problems with the ''Segnosaurus'' IGM specimens, including damage caused since collection, the disappearance of elements of the holotype, incorrect identification of assigned elements, and more than one individual bearing the same specimen number. Holotype elements Zanno was able to access in 2010 included a severely damaged ilium, a sacrum missing the left sacral ribs with damage so it could not conjoin well with the rest of the ilium, and a pubic bone and ischium missing their upper portions.

The nearly complete right hemimandible (half of the mandible) is {{convert|379|mm|in|abbr=on}} long from front to back, {{convert|55.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} at the highest point, and {{convert|24.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} at the lowest. The {{Dinogloss|dentary bone}}, the tooth-bearing bone forming most of the mandible's front part, was complex in shape compared to those of early therizinosaurs. The tooth-bearing part was almost rectangular and sloped downwards in side view with a pronounced arc throughout the upper length of the front end\u2014more extreme than what is known in other therizinosaurs. The front-most part of the dentary was strongly deflected downwards at about a 30 degree angle, a unique feature for this genus. When each hemimandible is articulated with the other, they form a broadly U-shaped, toothless mandibular symphysis that projects upwards towards the front as in ''Erlikosaurus'' and ''[[Neimongosaurus]]''. The expansive, toothless front region of the dentary spans {{convert|25.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} on the right hemimandible of the holotype. Proportionally, the toothless part of the dentary is 20% of its tooth row, which is {{convert|150.3|mm|in|abbr=on}} long. By comparison, the toothless region of ''Erlikosaurus'' was about 12% of the tooth row's length and was almost absent in ''Jianchangosaurus''. The height of the dentary diminished towards the hindmost extend of the tooth row, whereafter it sharply fanned out to contact the {{Dinogloss|surangular}} bone behind it; by contrast, the hind part of the dentary in ''Erlikosaurus'' gradually approached the surungular in a gentle arc.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\">{{cite journal|last1=Zanno|first1=L.

The teeth were restricted to the front two thirds of the dentary, which bore 24 {{Dinogloss|alveoli}} (tooth sockets) in a manner similar to ''Jianchangosaurus'' but different from ''Erlikosaurus'', in which nearly the entire dentary was toothed, bearing 31 alveoli. The tooth row of ''Segnosaurus'' was inset and demarcated by a shelf on the outer side as it was in all derived (or \"advanced\") therizinosaurs. Unlike in other related taxa, the shelf was restricted to the hind part of the dentary and the raised rim that defined it was not as pronounced. ''Segnosaurus'' was unique in having a low ridge rising between the fifth and fourteenth alveoli that divided the dentary into two almost-equally sized front and hind parts. Just above this ridge, the dentary was pierced by a row of {{Dinogloss|foramina}} as in ''Jianchangosaurus'' and ''[[Alxasaurus]]'', which became less regular by the region around the mandibular symphysis, where the two halves of the mandible met at the front. This row was instead directly in line with and on the side of the ridge in ''Erlikosaurus''. The {{Dinogloss|Meckelian groove}} that ran along the inner side of the mandible, was placed further down than in ''Erlikosaurus'' and had a consistent depth until the thirteenth tooth position, whereafter it widened. The lower jaw elements behind the dentary (the {{Dinogloss|splenial}}, surangular, {{Dinogloss|angular}}, and {{Dinogloss|prearticular}} bones) were distinct from those of other therizinosaurs, being gracile and linear, and contributing to the hind part of the hemimandible being elongate and almost rectangular.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/> The surangular was long and sword-shaped, the angular was wing-like in shape, the prearticular was narrow and curved, and the splenial was thin and triangular in outline. The external mandibular fenestra, an opening at the outer side of the mandible, was larger than that of ''Erlikosaurus'' because the surangular was shallow from top to bottom.<ref name=\"Perle1979\" />\n\n[[File:Mesial dentary teeth of Segnosaurus.png|thumb|upright|Frontmost dentary teeth, showing folded {{Dinogloss|carinae}} (lf) and accessory {{Dinogloss|denticles}} (ad)]]\n''Segnosaurus'' had the fewest teeth in the dentary; 24 in each half determined from the number of sockets, as well as the largest teeth known among therizinosaurs. The dentary teeth were foliodont (leaf-shaped) and bore enlarged, relatively tall, sideways compressed crowns with a slight recurvature at the upper margin of the tips. By comparison, the teeth of ''Erlikosaurus'' were smaller, symmetrical, and simpler. The bases of the crowns increased slightly in size hindwards across the tooth row, which reflected a decrease in sideways compression. The front surfaces of the crowns and outward-facing sides were convex while the inward-facing sides were concave. A thickened ridge ran along the longitude of the inward-facing side near the upper half of the crown, which was flanked by weak grooves near the front and back edges of the teeth, reaching almost to the cervix (neck; the transition between the crown and root) of the teeth. In general, the 18 front-most teeth were relatively homodont (of the same type), though the crown of the second tooth was relatively shorter and more tapered; this may also have been true for the first tooth, but it was not preserved. The teeth further back in the row also decreased in relative height hindwards. By comparison, the front four to five dentary teeth of ''Erlikosaurus'' were conidont (cone-shaped) with a gradual transition to foliodont teeth.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/><ref name=\"Perle1979\" />\n\nThe dentary teeth were tightly packed, but not pressed closely together, with the tooth crowns approaching each other at mid-length. The {{Dinogloss|denticles}} (serrations) were large and bulbous, diminishing slightly in size towards the tooth tips, with about 5\u20136 denticles per {{convert|3|mm|in|abbr=on}}. The front {{Dinogloss|carinae}} (cutting edges) folded upwards to overlap the inner surface of the crowns on the third to eighteenth teeth, but such folds were absent on the second and probably first crowns. The denticles were roughly perpendicular with the tip of the tooth crowns, but parallel to the crown height on the front side fold and triangular facet on the hind side. There was a series of accessory denticles (in addition to those on the carinae) that projected from the front surfaces of the carinal folds, which made the front edges of the crowns more broadly roughened. The carinae of the hind edges were also very modified, and bifurcated (split in two) near the cervix, where they formed a flattened triangular, raised facet, which projected from the tooth crown and contacted or approached the folded carinae on the front edge of the crowns behind them (this arrangement is present in teeth 2\u201312). Such split carinae are known from other [[tetanuran]] theropods, where they are considered abnormalities caused by trauma, aberrant [[tooth replacement]], or genetic factors. Though the condition in ''Segnosaurus'' was similar, it was uniformly expressed across the teeth of both dentaries, and does not appear to have been an abnormality, but served to roughen the contacts between tooth bases.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/>\n\nThe 22nd and 23rd dentary teeth of ''Segnosaurus'' were significantly smaller than the rest, almost conidont, and had an additional third carina with denticles on their inner sides. Most of the other hindmost tooth crowns are damaged so their complete features are unknown. The additional carina on tooth 23 appears to have been fully denticulated while the denticles were restricted to the basal side of the crown in tooth 22. ''Segnosaurus'' was unique among all known theropods in possessing triple carinae. The 14th alveolus on the right dentary of the holotype is walled over by seemingly [[pathological]] (due to injury or disease) bone growth but the teeth in that part of the dentary are damaged so it is not possible to determine how the teeth were affected by this. The teeth in the same area of the left dentary bear triple carinae, though this dentary has no external indications of pathology that could have led to this condition, thus it cannot be concluded nor ruled out that this feature is the result of a pathology. ''Segnosaurus'' [[Polyphyodont|replaced its teeth]] in waves running from back to front of the jaws, that encompassed two to three erupting crowns. Some of the fully erupted teeth have wear on the carinae of their hind sides, unlike what is seen in other therizinosaurs. The texture of the {{Dinogloss|enamel}} appears to have been broadly irregular and the roots of the teeth were almost circular.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/>\n\n===Postcranial skeleton===\n[[File:Segno.jpg|thumb|[[paleoart|Life restoration]]]]\n\nThe {{Dinogloss|scapula}} (shoulder blade) of ''Segnosaurus'' was straight and flat at the upper end, and was fused to the coracoid bone, forming the scapulocoracoid. The coracoid was very wide, rectangular in outline, and thick at the middle. The massive humerus was {{convert|560|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length; it had an almost-cylindrical shaft and well-defined condyles for articulation with the radius and ulna of the lower arm. The deltopectoral crest, where the [[deltoid muscle]] was attached to the upper front of the humerus, was well-developed.<ref name=Perle1979/> The humerus was distinct from those of other therizinosaurs, being straight rather than [[sigmoid shaped]] and not expanded or deflected forwards at its upper end. The humerus was also not expanded at the middle, and the [[entepicondyle]] was not well-developed. The lack of these features was more similar to [[ornithomimosaurs]] and [[troodontids]] than to other therizinosaurs.<ref name=Zanno2010/> The radius was also massive\u2014about 60 percent of the humerus\u2014with a straight shaft. The ulna was thicker than the radius and slightly longer\u2014about 70 percent of the humerus\u2014and slightly twisted along its middle axis. The hand was [[tridactyl]] (three-fingered). The {{Dinogloss|phalanx bones}} of the fingers were flattened from top to bottom and the articular depressions on their sides were not very developed. The first phalanx of the first finger was long and thin while the first and second phalanxes of the second finger were short. The ungual of the third finger was somewhat longer than the second phalanx and quite flat from top to bottom, which may have been a unique feature of ''Segnosaurus''. This ungual was sharpy curved, very pointed, and compressed from side to side. The lower tubercle, where the flexor tendons attached to the ungual, was thick and robust.<ref name=Perle1979/><ref name=Zanno2010/><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /><ref name=\"Dinosauria2\">{{cite book| last1 = Clark | first1 = J.

The pelvis was shortened at the front, a feature found among bird-like theropods but uncommon among theropods as a whole.<ref name=Perle1979/> The pubic bone was directed backwards and down in parallel with the ischium; this backwards orientation of the pubic bone is known as the {{Dinogloss|opisthopubic}} condition. This feature is only known from birds and their closest [[coelurosaurian]] relatives while other theropod dinosaurs had forwards-directed pubic bones.<ref name=\"Opisthopubic\">{{cite journal |last1=Barsbold |first1=R. |title=Opisthopubic pelvis in the carnivorous dinosaurs |journal=Nature |date=1979 |volume=279 |issue=5716 |pages=792\u2013793 |doi=10.1038/279792a0|bibcode=1979Natur.279..792B |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3e1488c6b9208aef2b37fd501db021025bd8dba9 }}</ref><ref name=\"Dinosauria2\"/> The pubic bone was elongated, flattened sideways, and had an ellisoid projection or \"boot\" at the front of its lower end.<ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /><ref name=\"Dinosauria2\"/> The pelvis was distinct from those of other therizinosaurs in that the upper margin of the ilium had a pronounced overhang on the lower side and that the hindwards projecting process of the ischium was extensive, almost 50 percent of the front-to-back length of the {{Dinogloss|obturator process}}. Some features of the pelvis were similar to that of ''[[Nothronychus]]'', particularly the ischia, but it is uncertain whether these similarities were due to them having a common ancestor to the exclusion of other derived therizinosaurids, or because they retained basal features since lost in other relatives. The ischium of ''Segnosaurus'' was distinct from that of ''Nothronychus'' in that it had an almost-rectangular obturator process and an almost-circular obturator foramen. The pelvis was distinct from that of ''[[Enigmosaurus]]'' by its deep obturator process not fusing with its counterpart at the middle, by its unfused pubic boot, and because the lower part of the pubic shaft was wide from front to back. ''Segnosaurus'' was distinct from both ''Nothronychus'' and ''Enigmosaurus'' in having a deep {{Dinogloss|brevis fossa}} (a groove where the [[caudofemoralis brevis muscle]] of the tail originated) and because its pubic boot lacked a well developed hindwards projection.<ref name=Zanno2010/>\n\nThe femur was straight with an oval cross-section and was {{convert|840|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length. The head of the femur was placed on a long \"neck\" and the lower condyles were well-defined. The tibia was straight, slightly shorter than the femur, and twisted along its axis. The fibula was long and narrowed towards its lower end. The metatarsus of the foot was short, massive, and consisted of five bones\u2014four of which functioned as support elements and terminated in four toes. Functionally tetradactyl (four-toed) feet were unique to derived therizinosaurs; basal therizinosaurs and all other theropods had tridactyl feet in which the first toe was short and did not reach the ground. Externally, the metatarsus was similar to, though proportionally larger than, those of [[prosauropods]], an early [[evolutionary grade]] of [[sauropodomorphs]]. The epiphyses on the upper metatarsals were hypertrophied (enlarged), a distinctive feature of the genus. The first toe was shorter than the others but was of equal functional importance; the second and third toes were equally long while the fourth was thinnest. The toe ungual was robust, sharply curved, flat at the side, and more pointed than those of prosauropods. The lower tubercle where the flexor ligaments attached was robust. While the lack of strong compression of the toe unguals distinguished ''Segnosaurus'' from ''Erlikosaurus'' from the same formation, the lack of compression was common among therizinosaurs and therefore not unique to ''Segnosaurus''.<ref name=Perle1979/><ref name=Zanno2010/><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /> The cervical vertebrae were platycoelous and had large, massive centra (bodies) and low neural arches. The sacrum consisted of six, firmly fused  vertebrae; the centra of these vertebrae were broadened and relatively elongated, and each centrum was slightly longer than their width. The neural spines here were not very long but surpassed the level of the ilia. The caudal (tail) vertebrae closest to the body were massive, high, and somewhat compressed from side to side. The neural arch was low with a small neural canal. The caudal vertebrae closer to the tip of the tail were platycoelous and had short, massive centra. The transverse processes of the caudal vertebrae and the ribs were robust and elongated.<ref name=Perle1979/><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" />\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:Erlikosaurus skull and foot.jpg|thumb|Skull and foot bones of ''[[Erlikosaurus]]'', which together with ''Segnosaurus'' (both from Mongolia) became the basis of the new [[infraorder]] Segnosauria; this group is now a [[junior synonym]] of [[Therizinosauria]]]]\n\n''Segnosaurus'' and its relatives, which are now recognized as therizinosaurs (\"scythe reptiles\"), were long considered an enigmatic group. Their mosaic of features resembling those of different dinosaur groups and the scarcity of their fossils led to controversy over their evolutionary relationships for decades after their initial discovery (the forelimb elements of ''[[Therizinosaurus]]'' itself were originally identified as belonging to a giant turtle when described in 1954).<ref name=\"Zanno2006\">{{cite journal |last=Zanno |first=L.

He tentatively classified Segnosauridae as theropods, traditionally thought of as the \"meat-eating\" dinosaurs, pointing to similarities in the mandible and its front teeth. Using features of their humeri and hand claws, he distinguished Segnosauridae from the theropod families [[Deinocheiridae]] and Therizinosauridae, which were then only known from the genera ''[[Deinocheirus]]'' and ''Therizinosaurus'', respectively, mainly represented by large forelimbs found in Mongolia.<ref name=Perle1979/> Later in 1979, Barsbold and Perle found the pelvic features of segnosaurids and dromaeosaurids were so different from those of \"true\" theropods that they should be separated into three taxa of the same rank, possibly at the level of [[infraorder]] within [[Saurischia]], one of the two main divisions of dinosaurs\u2014the other being [[Ornithischia]].<ref name=\"Barsbold&Perle1979\" />\n\nIn 1980, Barsbold and Perle named the new theropod infraorder Segnosauria, containing only Segnosauridae. In the same article, they named the new genus ''Erlikosaurus'' (known from a well-preserved skull and partial skeleton)\u2014which they tentatively considered a segnosaurid\u2014and reported a partial pelvis of an undetermined segnosaurian, both from the same formation as ''Segnosaurus''. The specimens provided relatively complete data on this group; they were united by their opisthopubic pelvis, slender mandible, and the toothless front of their jaws. Barsbold and Perle stated that, though some of their features resembled those of ornithischians and sauropods, these similarities were superficial and distinct when examined in detail. While they were essentially different from other theropods\u2014perhaps due to diverging from them relatively early\u2014and warranted a new infraorder, they did show similarities with the theropods. Because the ''Erlikosaurus'' specimen lacked a pelvis, the authors were unsure that the undetermined segnosaurian could belong to the same genus, in which case they would consider it part of a separate family.<ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /> Though ''Erlikosaurus'' was difficult to compare directly to ''Segnosaurus'' because its remains were incomplete, Perle stated in 1981 there was no justification for separating it into another family.<ref name=Perle1981>{{cite journal | last=Perle | first=A. |author-link=Altangerel Perle |year=1981 |title=Noviy segnozavrid iz verchnego mela Mongolii |journal=Trudy \u2013 Sovmestnaya Sovetsko-Mongol'skaya Paleontologicheskaya Ekspeditsiya |volume=15 |pages=50\u201359|language=Russian|trans-title=New Segnosauridae from the Upper Cretaceous of Mongolia|translator-last=Siskron |translator-first=C. |translator2-last=Welles |translator2-first=S.

While ''Alxasaurus'' was similar in some respects to prosauropods, the detailed morphology of its limbs linked it to ''Therizinosaurus'' and segnosaurs. Because its fore and hindlimbs were preserved, ''Alxasaurus'' showed that Perle's assignment of segnosaurian hindlimbs to ''Therizinosaurus'' was probably correct. Russell and Dong therefore proposed that Segnosauridae was a [[junior synonym]] of the older name Therizinosauridae, and that ''Alxasaurus'' was the most completely known representative so far. They also named the new higher taxonomic rank [[Therizinosauroidea]] to contain ''Alxasaurus'' and Therizinosauridae because the new genus was somewhat different from its relatives. They concluded that therizinosaurs were tetanuran theropods, most closely related to ornithomimids, troodontids, and oviraptorids, which they placed together in the group [[Oviraptorosauria]] (because they found [[Maniraptora]]\u2014the conventional grouping of these\u2014invalid, and the higher level taxonomy of theropods was in flux).<ref name=\"Alxasaurus\">{{cite journal |last1=Russell |first1=D.

One possibility is they dispersed through [[vicariance]], whereby therizinosaurs were present in the areas that became Asia and North America before the [[rifting]] that divided these areas in the [[Late Triassic]]. The other possibility is that basal therizinosaurs dispersed between Asia and North America via Europe after the rifting event but before the middle [[Barremian]]; between 132\u2013138&nbsp;million years ago, a temporary [[land bridge]] connected North America and Europe, whereafter the landmasses were again isolated from each other, explaining why the basal therizinosaurs ''Beipiaosaurus'' from Asia and ''Falcarius'' from North America were so morphologically divergent from each other, though coeval. The presence of the derived therizinosaurid ''Nothronychus'', which was most-closely related to Asian genera, in North America during the [[Turonian]] stage of the early [[Late Cretaceous]] also shows there would have been a [[faunal interchange]] between North America and Asia via a late-Early Cretaceous land bridge before that (during the [[Aptian]]/[[Albian]]), which is also seen in some other dinosaur groups.<ref name=Zanno2010/>\n\n==Paleobiology==\n[[File:Therizinosaurs.jpg|thumb|left|Reconstructed skeletons of the North American therizinosaurs ''[[Nothronychus]]'' (large) and ''[[Falcarius]]'', in modern, bipedal postures, [[Natural History Museum of Utah]]]]\n\nIn 1979 and 1981, Barsbold and Perle said the short, massive metatarsus and unusually large, splayed toes indicated that ''Segnosaurus'' and its relatives were not adapted for rapid locomotion, perhaps because it was not required by their lifestyle; Barsbold and Perle suggested they could have been [[Semiaquatic|amphibious]].<ref name=\"Barsbold&Perle1979\">{{Cite journal |last=Barsbold |first=R. |last2=Perle |first2=A. |author2-link=Altangerel Perle |year=1979 |title=Modiphikatsiy tasa sayrisziy i parallelinoe rasvitie zishchnich dinosavrov |trans-title=Modification in the saurischian pelvis and the parallel development of predatory dinosaurs |journal=Transactions of the Joint Soviet Mongolian Paleontological Expedition |volume=8 |pages=39\u201344|language=Russian|translator-last=Welsh |translator-first=W.

Like ornithischians, they could therefore crop, manipulate, and chew plants in a sophisticated manner. He also suggested the ilia of the pelvis had sideways-flaring blades at the front similar to those of sauropods to support a large gut that was used to ferment and process food.<ref name=\"Paul1984\"/> Norman stated in 1985 the possibility ''Segnosaurus'' was an aquatic fish eater could explain its small, pointed teeth and broad and perhaps webbed feet, but found it mysterious why it should have a horny beak.<ref name=\"DBN85\"/>\n\n[[File:Erliansaurus bellamanus.jpg|thumb|Restoration of ''[[Erliansaurus]]'' in a \"sitting\" pose that therizinosaurs may have employed during feeding]]\nIn 1993, Russell and Dong considered the small size of the head, blunt beaks and large body weights of therizinosaurs consistent with herbivory.<ref name=\"Alxasaurus\"/> In 1993 and 1997, Russell suggested therizinosaurs would have \"sat\" on their pelvises and supported their bodies on their hind limbs while using their long arms, claws, and flexible necks to reach leaves from trees and bushes with their beaks. They could have reached even higher while standing and browsing bipedally. This parallels the way some herbivorous mammals use their forelimbs to manipulate vegetation; Russell considered the extinct [[chalicotheres]] and [[ground sloth]]s, as well as [[gorilla]]s, adaptively convergent with therizinosaurs.

Zanno and colleagues found the clades at the base of Maniraptora\u2014Ornithomimosauria, Therizinosauria, and Oviraptorosauria\u2014had either direct or morphological evidence for herbivory, which would mean either this diet evolved independently multiple times in coelurosaurian theropods or that the primitive condition of the group was at least facultative herbivory with carnivory only emerging in more derived maniraptorans.<ref name=\"Zanno2009\">{{cite journal |last1=Zanno |first1=L.

In genera where both neck and forelimb elements are preserved, however, the necks were equal in length or longer than the forelimbs, so pulling vegetation would only make sense if lower parts of long branches were pulled down to access out-of-reach parts of trees.<ref name=\"Claws\"/>\n\n[[File:Dentary teeth of Segnosaurus.png|thumb|upright|Hindmost dentary teeth showing the third cutting edge (lc), unique to ''Segnosaurus'' among theropods]]\nZanno and colleagues stated in 2016 that therizinosaurs were generally accepted to fall within the spectrum of [[omnivory]] and herbivory, with a trend towards intensified herbivory. While various anatomical features have been used to support this idea, tooth morphology had been considered relatively simplistic and with few unique specializations compared to other herbivorous dinosaurs. The few modifications include the increased symmetry in the teeth of ''Erlikosaurus'' and the enlargement of denticles in ''Segnosaurus''. Zanno and collegaues identified novel, complex features in the dentary teeth of ''Segnosaurus'', including the presence of additional carinae and folded carinae with denticulated front edges, which indicate ''Segnosaurus'' had a higher degree of oral food processing than other therizinosaurs. These traits together created a roughened, shredding surface near the base of the tooth crowns that was unique to ''Segnosaurus'' and suggest it consumed unique food resources or used highly specialized feeding strategies. Because multiple geological formations show evidence of [[sympatric]] therizinosaur species\u2014related species that lived in the same area at the same time\u2014it is possible [[niche partitioning]] between them could have played a role in the group's evolutionary success. This is supported by ''Segnosaurus'' with its highly specialized dentition being a contemporary of ''Erlikosaurus'' with its relatively indistinct teeth, indicating their partitioning in food acquisition, processing, or resources. This conclusion is also strengthened by the large difference in estimated body masses of sympatric therizinosaurs in the Bayan Shireh Formation, which was up to 500%.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/>\n\nIn a 2017 study of niche partitioning in therizinosaurs through digital simulations, Lautenschlager found the dentaries of ''Segnosaurus'' experienced one of the lowest stress magnitudes during extrinsic feeding scenarios. ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' were aided by the down-turned tip of the lower jaws and symphyseal regions, and probably also by beaks, which are known to mitigate stress and strain. By contrast, the straighter and more elongated dentaries of basal therizinosaurs\u2014typical of their coelurosaurian ancestors\u2014had the highest magnitudes of stress and strain. A downwards-pulling motion of the head while gripping vegetation was more likely than a sideways or upwards movement, though such behavior would be more likely in ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' with their stress-mitigating jaws. Difference in relative bite force between the sympatric ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' show the former would have been able to feed on tougher vegetation while the overall robustness of the latter suggests greater flexibility in its manner of feeding, because stress levels stayed low across feeding simulations. Lautenschlager agreed the two taxa were adapted to different modes of feeding and food selection; ''Segnosaurus'' was more adapted to using its dentition to procure or process food while ''Erlikosaurus'' mostly used its beak for cropping and its neck musculature while foraging. The difference in size between ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' (the former of which is estimated to have weighed more than the latter) indicates these effects were increased and that there were further mechanisms partitioning their resources, such as different heights. Because other therizinosaur taxa were more divided in time and space, other factors than competition within their group may also have contributed to their variation, such as adaptations to different flora and competition with other kinds of herbivores.<ref name=\"Niche\">{{cite journal |last1=Lautenschlager |first1=S. |title=Functional niche partitioning in Therizinosauria provides new insights into the evolution of theropod herbivory |journal=Palaeontology |date=2017 |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=375\u2013387 |doi=10.1111/pala.12289|url=http://pure-oai.bham.ac.uk/ws/files/39402933/FUNCTIONAL_NICHE_PARTITIONING_IN_THERIZINOSAURIA_REVISED2.pdf }}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Loredana Macaluso and colleagues pointed out that the hips of therizinosaurs were peculiar because the shaft of the pubic bone was rotated backwards whereas the pubic boot was strongly projected forwards.

Multiple incomplete but well-preserved specimens were discovered in the [[Gobi Desert]] in the 1970s, and in 1979 the genus and species '''''Segnosaurus galbinensis''''' were named. The generic name ''Segnosaurus'' means \"slow lizard\" and the specific name ''galbinensis'' refers to the [[Galbin]] region. The known material of this dinosaur includes the lower jaw, neck and tail vertebrae, the pelvis, shoulder girdle, and limb bones. Parts of the specimens have gone missing or become damaged since they were collected.\n\n''Segnosaurus'' was a large-bodied [[therizinosaur]] that is estimated to have been about {{convert|6\u20137|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and to have weighed about {{convert|1.3|MT|ST|abbr=on}}. It would have been bipedal, with the trunk of its body tilted upwards. The head was small with a beak at the tip of the jaws, and the neck was long and slender. The lower jaw was down-turned at the front and the teeth were distinct in having additional {{Dinogloss|denticles}} as well as third cutting edges in some of the hindmost teeth. The forelimbs were robust and had three fingers which bore large claws, and the feet had four toes supporting the foot\u2014apart from therizinosaurs, all [[theropods]] had three-toed feet. The front of the pelvis was adapted to support the enlarged belly. The [[pubic bone]] was turned backwards, a feature that is only seen in birds and the dinosaurs most closely related to them.\n\nThe affinities of ''Segnosaurus'' were originally obscure and it received its own theropod family, Segnosauridae, and later when related genera were identified, an [[infraorder]], Segnosauria. Alternative classification schemes were proposed until more complete relatives were described in the 1990s, which confirmed them as theropods. The new fossils also showed Segnosauridae was a [[junior synonym]] of the earlier named family Therizinosauridae. ''Segnosaurus'' and its relatives are thought to have been slow-moving animals that, as indicated by their unusual features, were mainly herbivorous, whereas most other theropod groups were carnivorous. Therizinosaurs probably used their long forelimbs, long necks, and beaks when [[Browsing (herbivory)|browsing]], and large guts for processing food. ''Segnosaurus'' is known from the [[Bayan Shireh Formation]], where it lived alongside the fellow therizinosaurs ''[[Erlikosaurus]]'' and ''[[Enigmosaurus]]''; these related genera were probably [[niche partitioned]].\n\n==History of discovery==\n[[File:Cretaceous-aged dinosaur fossil localities of Mongolia.PNG|thumb|left|upright=1.4|[[Cretaceous]]-aged dinosaur fossil localities of Mongolia; ''Segnosaurus'' was found by areas C and D (right, Amtgay and Khara-Khutul localities)]]\n\nIn 1973, a joint [[Soviet]]\u2013Mongolian expedition investigating the [[Bayan Shireh Formation]] at the Amtgay locality in the [[Gobi Desert]] of southeastern Mongolia discovered fossils that included the partial skeleton of an unknown [[dinosaur]]. Through 1974 and 1975, more remains were uncovered at the Amtgay and Khara-Khutul localities; though the skeletons were incomplete, the recovered bones were well-preserved. Other localities listed in the literature include Bayshin-Tsav and Urilbe-Khuduk. These fossils were scientifically [[species description|described]] in 1979 by the paleontologist [[Altangerel Perle]], who named the new [[genus]] and species ''Segnosaurus galbiensis''.

The nearly complete right hemimandible (half of the mandible) is {{convert|379|mm|in|abbr=on}} long from front to back, {{convert|55.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} at the highest point, and {{convert|24.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} at the lowest. The {{Dinogloss|dentary bone}}, the tooth-bearing bone forming most of the mandible's front part, was complex in shape compared to those of early therizinosaurs. The tooth-bearing part was almost rectangular and sloped downwards in side view with a pronounced arc throughout the upper length of the front end\u2014more extreme than what is known in other therizinosaurs. The front-most part of the dentary was strongly deflected downwards at about a 30 degree angle, a unique feature for this genus. When each hemimandible is articulated with the other, they form a broadly U-shaped, toothless mandibular symphysis that projects upwards towards the front as in ''Erlikosaurus'' and ''[[Neimongosaurus]]''. The expansive, toothless front region of the dentary spans {{convert|25.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} on the right hemimandible of the holotype. Proportionally, the toothless part of the dentary is 20% of its tooth row, which is {{convert|150.3|mm|in|abbr=on}} long. By comparison, the toothless region of ''Erlikosaurus'' was about 12% of the tooth row's length and was almost absent in ''Jianchangosaurus''. The height of the dentary diminished towards the hindmost extend of the tooth row, whereafter it sharply fanned out to contact the {{Dinogloss|surangular}} bone behind it; by contrast, the hind part of the dentary in ''Erlikosaurus'' gradually approached the surungular in a gentle arc.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\">{{cite journal|last1=Zanno|first1=L.

The teeth were restricted to the front two thirds of the dentary, which bore 24 {{Dinogloss|alveoli}} (tooth sockets) in a manner similar to ''Jianchangosaurus'' but different from ''Erlikosaurus'', in which nearly the entire dentary was toothed, bearing 31 alveoli. The tooth row of ''Segnosaurus'' was inset and demarcated by a shelf on the outer side as it was in all derived (or \"advanced\") therizinosaurs. Unlike in other related taxa, the shelf was restricted to the hind part of the dentary and the raised rim that defined it was not as pronounced. ''Segnosaurus'' was unique in having a low ridge rising between the fifth and fourteenth alveoli that divided the dentary into two almost-equally sized front and hind parts. Just above this ridge, the dentary was pierced by a row of {{Dinogloss|foramina}} as in ''Jianchangosaurus'' and ''[[Alxasaurus]]'', which became less regular by the region around the mandibular symphysis, where the two halves of the mandible met at the front. This row was instead directly in line with and on the side of the ridge in ''Erlikosaurus''. The {{Dinogloss|Meckelian groove}} that ran along the inner side of the mandible, was placed further down than in ''Erlikosaurus'' and had a consistent depth until the thirteenth tooth position, whereafter it widened. The lower jaw elements behind the dentary (the {{Dinogloss|splenial}}, surangular, {{Dinogloss|angular}}, and {{Dinogloss|prearticular}} bones) were distinct from those of other therizinosaurs, being gracile and linear, and contributing to the hind part of the hemimandible being elongate and almost rectangular.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/> The surangular was long and sword-shaped, the angular was wing-like in shape, the prearticular was narrow and curved, and the splenial was thin and triangular in outline. The external mandibular fenestra, an opening at the outer side of the mandible, was larger than that of ''Erlikosaurus'' because the surangular was shallow from top to bottom.<ref name=\"Perle1979\" />\n\n[[File:Mesial dentary teeth of Segnosaurus.png|thumb|upright|Frontmost dentary teeth, showing folded {{Dinogloss|carinae}} (lf) and accessory {{Dinogloss|denticles}} (ad)]]\n''Segnosaurus'' had the fewest teeth in the dentary; 24 in each half determined from the number of sockets, as well as the largest teeth known among therizinosaurs. The dentary teeth were foliodont (leaf-shaped) and bore enlarged, relatively tall, sideways compressed crowns with a slight recurvature at the upper margin of the tips. By comparison, the teeth of ''Erlikosaurus'' were smaller, symmetrical, and simpler. The bases of the crowns increased slightly in size hindwards across the tooth row, which reflected a decrease in sideways compression. The front surfaces of the crowns and outward-facing sides were convex while the inward-facing sides were concave. A thickened ridge ran along the longitude of the inward-facing side near the upper half of the crown, which was flanked by weak grooves near the front and back edges of the teeth, reaching almost to the cervix (neck; the transition between the crown and root) of the teeth. In general, the 18 front-most teeth were relatively homodont (of the same type), though the crown of the second tooth was relatively shorter and more tapered; this may also have been true for the first tooth, but it was not preserved. The teeth further back in the row also decreased in relative height hindwards. By comparison, the front four to five dentary teeth of ''Erlikosaurus'' were conidont (cone-shaped) with a gradual transition to foliodont teeth.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/><ref name=\"Perle1979\" />\n\nThe dentary teeth were tightly packed, but not pressed closely together, with the tooth crowns approaching each other at mid-length. The {{Dinogloss|denticles}} (serrations) were large and bulbous, diminishing slightly in size towards the tooth tips, with about 5\u20136 denticles per {{convert|3|mm|in|abbr=on}}. The front {{Dinogloss|carinae}} (cutting edges) folded upwards to overlap the inner surface of the crowns on the third to eighteenth teeth, but such folds were absent on the second and probably first crowns. The denticles were roughly perpendicular with the tip of the tooth crowns, but parallel to the crown height on the front side fold and triangular facet on the hind side. There was a series of accessory denticles (in addition to those on the carinae) that projected from the front surfaces of the carinal folds, which made the front edges of the crowns more broadly roughened. The carinae of the hind edges were also very modified, and bifurcated (split in two) near the cervix, where they formed a flattened triangular, raised facet, which projected from the tooth crown and contacted or approached the folded carinae on the front edge of the crowns behind them (this arrangement is present in teeth 2\u201312). Such split carinae are known from other [[tetanuran]] theropods, where they are considered abnormalities caused by trauma, aberrant [[tooth replacement]], or genetic factors. Though the condition in ''Segnosaurus'' was similar, it was uniformly expressed across the teeth of both dentaries, and does not appear to have been an abnormality, but served to roughen the contacts between tooth bases.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/>\n\nThe 22nd and 23rd dentary teeth of ''Segnosaurus'' were significantly smaller than the rest, almost conidont, and had an additional third carina with denticles on their inner sides. Most of the other hindmost tooth crowns are damaged so their complete features are unknown. The additional carina on tooth 23 appears to have been fully denticulated while the denticles were restricted to the basal side of the crown in tooth 22. ''Segnosaurus'' was unique among all known theropods in possessing triple carinae. The 14th alveolus on the right dentary of the holotype is walled over by seemingly [[pathological]] (due to injury or disease) bone growth but the teeth in that part of the dentary are damaged so it is not possible to determine how the teeth were affected by this. The teeth in the same area of the left dentary bear triple carinae, though this dentary has no external indications of pathology that could have led to this condition, thus it cannot be concluded nor ruled out that this feature is the result of a pathology. ''Segnosaurus'' [[Polyphyodont|replaced its teeth]] in waves running from back to front of the jaws, that encompassed two to three erupting crowns. Some of the fully erupted teeth have wear on the carinae of their hind sides, unlike what is seen in other therizinosaurs. The texture of the {{Dinogloss|enamel}} appears to have been broadly irregular and the roots of the teeth were almost circular.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/>\n\n===Postcranial skeleton===\n[[File:Segno.jpg|thumb|[[paleoart|Life restoration]]]]\n\nThe {{Dinogloss|scapula}} (shoulder blade) of ''Segnosaurus'' was straight and flat at the upper end, and was fused to the coracoid bone, forming the scapulocoracoid. The coracoid was very wide, rectangular in outline, and thick at the middle. The massive humerus was {{convert|560|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length; it had an almost-cylindrical shaft and well-defined condyles for articulation with the radius and ulna of the lower arm. The deltopectoral crest, where the [[deltoid muscle]] was attached to the upper front of the humerus, was well-developed.<ref name=Perle1979/> The humerus was distinct from those of other therizinosaurs, being straight rather than [[sigmoid shaped]] and not expanded or deflected forwards at its upper end. The humerus was also not expanded at the middle, and the [[entepicondyle]] was not well-developed. The lack of these features was more similar to [[ornithomimosaurs]] and [[troodontids]] than to other therizinosaurs.<ref name=Zanno2010/> The radius was also massive\u2014about 60 percent of the humerus\u2014with a straight shaft. The ulna was thicker than the radius and slightly longer\u2014about 70 percent of the humerus\u2014and slightly twisted along its middle axis. The hand was [[tridactyl]] (three-fingered). The {{Dinogloss|phalanx bones}} of the fingers were flattened from top to bottom and the articular depressions on their sides were not very developed. The first phalanx of the first finger was long and thin while the first and second phalanxes of the second finger were short. The ungual of the third finger was somewhat longer than the second phalanx and quite flat from top to bottom, which may have been a unique feature of ''Segnosaurus''. This ungual was sharpy curved, very pointed, and compressed from side to side. The lower tubercle, where the flexor tendons attached to the ungual, was thick and robust.<ref name=Perle1979/><ref name=Zanno2010/><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /><ref name=\"Dinosauria2\">{{cite book| last1 = Clark | first1 = J.

Some features of the pelvis were similar to that of ''[[Nothronychus]]'', particularly the ischia, but it is uncertain whether these similarities were due to them having a common ancestor to the exclusion of other derived therizinosaurids, or because they retained basal features since lost in other relatives. The ischium of ''Segnosaurus'' was distinct from that of ''Nothronychus'' in that it had an almost-rectangular obturator process and an almost-circular obturator foramen. The pelvis was distinct from that of ''[[Enigmosaurus]]'' by its deep obturator process not fusing with its counterpart at the middle, by its unfused pubic boot, and because the lower part of the pubic shaft was wide from front to back. ''Segnosaurus'' was distinct from both ''Nothronychus'' and ''Enigmosaurus'' in having a deep {{Dinogloss|brevis fossa}} (a groove where the [[caudofemoralis brevis muscle]] of the tail originated) and because its pubic boot lacked a well developed hindwards projection.<ref name=Zanno2010/>\n\nThe femur was straight with an oval cross-section and was {{convert|840|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length. The head of the femur was placed on a long \"neck\" and the lower condyles were well-defined. The tibia was straight, slightly shorter than the femur, and twisted along its axis. The fibula was long and narrowed towards its lower end. The metatarsus of the foot was short, massive, and consisted of five bones\u2014four of which functioned as support elements and terminated in four toes. Functionally tetradactyl (four-toed) feet were unique to derived therizinosaurs; basal therizinosaurs and all other theropods had tridactyl feet in which the first toe was short and did not reach the ground. Externally, the metatarsus was similar to, though proportionally larger than, those of [[prosauropods]], an early [[evolutionary grade]] of [[sauropodomorphs]]. The epiphyses on the upper metatarsals were hypertrophied (enlarged), a distinctive feature of the genus. The first toe was shorter than the others but was of equal functional importance; the second and third toes were equally long while the fourth was thinnest. The toe ungual was robust, sharply curved, flat at the side, and more pointed than those of prosauropods. The lower tubercle where the flexor ligaments attached was robust. While the lack of strong compression of the toe unguals distinguished ''Segnosaurus'' from ''Erlikosaurus'' from the same formation, the lack of compression was common among therizinosaurs and therefore not unique to ''Segnosaurus''.<ref name=Perle1979/><ref name=Zanno2010/><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /> The cervical vertebrae were platycoelous and had large, massive centra (bodies) and low neural arches. The sacrum consisted of six, firmly fused  vertebrae; the centra of these vertebrae were broadened and relatively elongated, and each centrum was slightly longer than their width. The neural spines here were not very long but surpassed the level of the ilia. The caudal (tail) vertebrae closest to the body were massive, high, and somewhat compressed from side to side. The neural arch was low with a small neural canal. The caudal vertebrae closer to the tip of the tail were platycoelous and had short, massive centra. The transverse processes of the caudal vertebrae and the ribs were robust and elongated.<ref name=Perle1979/><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" />\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:Erlikosaurus skull and foot.jpg|thumb|Skull and foot bones of ''[[Erlikosaurus]]'', which together with ''Segnosaurus'' (both from Mongolia) became the basis of the new [[infraorder]] Segnosauria; this group is now a [[junior synonym]] of [[Therizinosauria]]]]\n\n''Segnosaurus'' and its relatives, which are now recognized as therizinosaurs (\"scythe reptiles\"), were long considered an enigmatic group.

He tentatively classified Segnosauridae as theropods, traditionally thought of as the \"meat-eating\" dinosaurs, pointing to similarities in the mandible and its front teeth. Using features of their humeri and hand claws, he distinguished Segnosauridae from the theropod families [[Deinocheiridae]] and Therizinosauridae, which were then only known from the genera ''[[Deinocheirus]]'' and ''Therizinosaurus'', respectively, mainly represented by large forelimbs found in Mongolia.<ref name=Perle1979/> Later in 1979, Barsbold and Perle found the pelvic features of segnosaurids and dromaeosaurids were so different from those of \"true\" theropods that they should be separated into three taxa of the same rank, possibly at the level of [[infraorder]] within [[Saurischia]], one of the two main divisions of dinosaurs\u2014the other being [[Ornithischia]].<ref name=\"Barsbold&Perle1979\" />\n\nIn 1980, Barsbold and Perle named the new theropod infraorder Segnosauria, containing only Segnosauridae. In the same article, they named the new genus ''Erlikosaurus'' (known from a well-preserved skull and partial skeleton)\u2014which they tentatively considered a segnosaurid\u2014and reported a partial pelvis of an undetermined segnosaurian, both from the same formation as ''Segnosaurus''. The specimens provided relatively complete data on this group; they were united by their opisthopubic pelvis, slender mandible, and the toothless front of their jaws. Barsbold and Perle stated that, though some of their features resembled those of ornithischians and sauropods, these similarities were superficial and distinct when examined in detail.

Each clutch contained eight spherical eggs with rough surfaces; the eggs were in contact with each other and arranged in a circular structure with no central opening. The researchers identified the eggs as dendroolithid, and therefore therizinosaurian. Though therizinosaurs are not known from the formation, it overlies the Bayan Shireh Formation where ''Segnosaurus'', ''Erlikosaurus'', and ''Enigmosaurus'' were found. The multiple clutches indicate some therizinosaurs were colonial nesters like [[hadrosaurs]], prosauropods, [[titanosaurs]], and birds. The eggs were found in a single [[stratigraphic layer]], suggesting the dinosaurs nested at the site on a single occasion and did not exhibit [[site fidelity]] (always returning to the same site to breed).<ref name=\"MongoliaEggs\">{{cite journal |title=First record of a dinosaur nesting colony from Mongolia reveals nesting behavior of therizinosauroids |journal=Hokkaido University |url=https://www.global.hokudai.ac.jp/blog/first-record-of-a-dinosaur-nesting-colony-from-mongolia-reveals-nesting-behavior-of-therizinosauroids/ |access-date=2019-12-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191221194650/https://www.global.hokudai.ac.jp/blog/first-record-of-a-dinosaur-nesting-colony-from-mongolia-reveals-nesting-behavior-of-therizinosauroids/ |archive-date=2019-12-21 |url-status=live |date=2013}}</ref>\n\n===Diet and feeding===\n[[File:Therizinosaurian mandibular morphology.png|thumb|left|Right half of the holotype mandible shown from the inner side (A), the top (C), and bottom (D), and the left half shown from the inner side (B), compared with the mandibles of other therizinosaurs (to scale in lower right)]]\n\nThe unusual features of therizinosaurs have led to several interpretations of their feeding behavior; there is no direct evidence of their diet, such as stomach contents and feeding traces. In 1970, [[Anatoly K. Rozhdestvensky]] suggested ''Therizinosaurus''\u2014the only member of the group known at the time\u2014used its large claws to open [[termite mounds]] or gather fruits from trees.<ref name=\"Dinosauria2\"/> Barsbold and Perle pointed out in 1979 and 1980 that their peculiar features probably reflected a different evolutionary direction than those of more typical theropods, many of which were considered effective, active predators. Their delicate jaws, small, weak teeth and beaks, and short, compact feet indicated they would not have used the armaments of other theropods to procure food, but could have preyed on fish.<ref name=\"Barsbold&Perle1979\" /><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /> In 1983, Barsbold said the horny beak at the front of the jaws and weakened teeth at the back were common features among herbivorous dinosaurs but not of carnivorous theropods, and speculated this might indicate segnosaurs had shifted to herbivory.<ref name=barsbold1983/> In 1984, Paul suggested they were herbivorous due to the similarities of their skulls to those of prosauropod and ornithischian dinosaurs, which include horny beaks, inset rows of teeth, and a shelf at the side of the jaws that indicated the presence of cheeks. Like ornithischians, they could therefore crop, manipulate, and chew plants in a sophisticated manner. He also suggested the ilia of the pelvis had sideways-flaring blades at the front similar to those of sauropods to support a large gut that was used to ferment and process food.<ref name=\"Paul1984\"/> Norman stated in 1985 the possibility ''Segnosaurus'' was an aquatic fish eater could explain its small, pointed teeth and broad and perhaps webbed feet, but found it mysterious why it should have a horny beak.<ref name=\"DBN85\"/>\n\n[[File:Erliansaurus bellamanus.jpg|thumb|Restoration of ''[[Erliansaurus]]'' in a \"sitting\" pose that therizinosaurs may have employed during feeding]]\nIn 1993, Russell and Dong considered the small size of the head, blunt beaks and large body weights of therizinosaurs consistent with herbivory.<ref name=\"Alxasaurus\"/> In 1993 and 1997, Russell suggested therizinosaurs would have \"sat\" on their pelvises and supported their bodies on their hind limbs while using their long arms, claws, and flexible necks to reach leaves from trees and bushes with their beaks. They could have reached even higher while standing and browsing bipedally. This parallels the way some herbivorous mammals use their forelimbs to manipulate vegetation; Russell considered the extinct [[chalicotheres]] and [[ground sloth]]s, as well as [[gorilla]]s, adaptively convergent with therizinosaurs. Because therizinosaur remains are often found in [[sediments]] deposited in river and lake environments, Russell said they may have browsed on [[riparian]] bushes and trees.<ref name=Russell1997>{{cite book |last=Russell |first=D.

He found this consistent with Rozhdestvensky's suggestion that therizinosaurs may have fed on [[social insects]].<ref name=\"Nessov\" /> In a 2006 conference abstract, Sara Burch presented the inferred range of motion in the arms of the therizinosaur ''Neimongosaurus'' and concluded the overall motion at the {{Dinogloss|glenoid}}-humeral joint at the shoulder was roughly circular, and directed sideways and slightly downwards, which diverged from the more oval, backwards-and-downwards-directed ranges of other theropods.

These included small, densely packed, coarse serrations; lanceolate (lance-shaped) teeth with a low replacement rate; a beak at the front of the jaws; an inset tooth row that suggests fleshy cheeks; an elongated neck; a small skull; a very large gut capacity as indicated by the rib circumference at the trunk and the outwards flaring processes of the ilia; and the loss of [[cursorial]] (related to running) adaptations in the hind limbs, including development of functionally tetradactyl feet. Zanno and colleagues found the clades at the base of Maniraptora\u2014Ornithomimosauria, Therizinosauria, and Oviraptorosauria\u2014had either direct or morphological evidence for herbivory, which would mean either this diet evolved independently multiple times in coelurosaurian theropods or that the primitive condition of the group was at least facultative herbivory with carnivory only emerging in more derived maniraptorans.<ref name=\"Zanno2009\">{{cite journal |last1=Zanno |first1=L.

In genera where both neck and forelimb elements are preserved, however, the necks were equal in length or longer than the forelimbs, so pulling vegetation would only make sense if lower parts of long branches were pulled down to access out-of-reach parts of trees.<ref name=\"Claws\"/>\n\n[[File:Dentary teeth of Segnosaurus.png|thumb|upright|Hindmost dentary teeth showing the third cutting edge (lc), unique to ''Segnosaurus'' among theropods]]\nZanno and colleagues stated in 2016 that therizinosaurs were generally accepted to fall within the spectrum of [[omnivory]] and herbivory, with a trend towards intensified herbivory. While various anatomical features have been used to support this idea, tooth morphology had been considered relatively simplistic and with few unique specializations compared to other herbivorous dinosaurs. The few modifications include the increased symmetry in the teeth of ''Erlikosaurus'' and the enlargement of denticles in ''Segnosaurus''. Zanno and collegaues identified novel, complex features in the dentary teeth of ''Segnosaurus'', including the presence of additional carinae and folded carinae with denticulated front edges, which indicate ''Segnosaurus'' had a higher degree of oral food processing than other therizinosaurs. These traits together created a roughened, shredding surface near the base of the tooth crowns that was unique to ''Segnosaurus'' and suggest it consumed unique food resources or used highly specialized feeding strategies. Because multiple geological formations show evidence of [[sympatric]] therizinosaur species\u2014related species that lived in the same area at the same time\u2014it is possible [[niche partitioning]] between them could have played a role in the group's evolutionary success. This is supported by ''Segnosaurus'' with its highly specialized dentition being a contemporary of ''Erlikosaurus'' with its relatively indistinct teeth, indicating their partitioning in food acquisition, processing, or resources. This conclusion is also strengthened by the large difference in estimated body masses of sympatric therizinosaurs in the Bayan Shireh Formation, which was up to 500%.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/>\n\nIn a 2017 study of niche partitioning in therizinosaurs through digital simulations, Lautenschlager found the dentaries of ''Segnosaurus'' experienced one of the lowest stress magnitudes during extrinsic feeding scenarios. ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' were aided by the down-turned tip of the lower jaws and symphyseal regions, and probably also by beaks, which are known to mitigate stress and strain. By contrast, the straighter and more elongated dentaries of basal therizinosaurs\u2014typical of their coelurosaurian ancestors\u2014had the highest magnitudes of stress and strain. A downwards-pulling motion of the head while gripping vegetation was more likely than a sideways or upwards movement, though such behavior would be more likely in ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' with their stress-mitigating jaws. Difference in relative bite force between the sympatric ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' show the former would have been able to feed on tougher vegetation while the overall robustness of the latter suggests greater flexibility in its manner of feeding, because stress levels stayed low across feeding simulations. Lautenschlager agreed the two taxa were adapted to different modes of feeding and food selection; ''Segnosaurus'' was more adapted to using its dentition to procure or process food while ''Erlikosaurus'' mostly used its beak for cropping and its neck musculature while foraging. The difference in size between ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' (the former of which is estimated to have weighed more than the latter) indicates these effects were increased and that there were further mechanisms partitioning their resources, such as different heights. Because other therizinosaur taxa were more divided in time and space, other factors than competition within their group may also have contributed to their variation, such as adaptations to different flora and competition with other kinds of herbivores.<ref name=\"Niche\">{{cite journal |last1=Lautenschlager |first1=S. |title=Functional niche partitioning in Therizinosauria provides new insights into the evolution of theropod herbivory |journal=Palaeontology |date=2017 |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=375\u2013387 |doi=10.1111/pala.12289|url=http://pure-oai.bham.ac.uk/ws/files/39402933/FUNCTIONAL_NICHE_PARTITIONING_IN_THERIZINOSAURIA_REVISED2.pdf }}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Loredana Macaluso and colleagues pointed out that the hips of therizinosaurs were peculiar because the shaft of the pubic bone was rotated backwards whereas the pubic boot was strongly projected forwards. While the larger gut associated with herbivory was able to push the shaft backwards, they suggested the pubic boot was restrained by [[ventilatory muscles]] that were crucial for cuirassal ventilation\u2014breathing with extra [[air sacs]]\u2014which shows the importance of this mode of respiration.<ref name=\"Macaluso\">{{cite journal |last1=Macaluso |first1=L. |last2=Tschopp |first2=E. |last3=Mannion |first3=P. |title=Evolutionary changes in pubic orientation in dinosaurs are more strongly correlated with the ventilation system than with herbivory |journal=Palaeontology |date=2018 |volume=61 |issue=5 |pages=703\u2013719 |doi=10.1111/pala.12362}}</ref> In a 2019 study of jaw musculature, Ali Nabavizadeh concluded therizinosaurs were mainly orthal feeders\u2014moving their jaws up and down\u2014and raised their jaws isognathously whereby the upper and lower teeth of each side [[Occlusion (dentistry)|occluded]] (contacted each other) at once.

The company's PPV lineup expanded to a monthly basis in the mid-1990s before expanding even further in the early-2000s. Aside from its standard monthly schedule, WWE produced additional international PPVs between 1997 and 2003. These events were not available in the United States and coincided with overseas tours in the United Kingdom. Following WWE's original [[WWE brand extension|brand extension]] in 2002, the company promoted two touring rosters representing its [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] television programs. The traditional \"Big Four\" continued to showcase the entire roster, while the remaining PPV events alternated between Raw and SmackDown cards. A special [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|ECW]] PPV in 2005 led to the creation of an [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW brand]] in 2006, which also received its own dedicated PPV events. In March 2007, WWE announced that all subsequent PPV events would feature performers from all brands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2007/2007_03_14.jsp |accessdate=December 1, 2007 |title=WWE Pay-Per-Views to follow WrestleMania formula |publisher=WWE |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319234707/http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2007/2007_03_14.jsp |archivedate=March 19, 2007 |df= }}</ref> In 2008, all WWE PPV events began broadcasting in [[High-definition television|high-definition]].\n\nThe company's PPV business began to drastically change with the launch of the WWE Network on February 24, 2014. While most of the WWE events still air in many parts of the world on traditional PPV channels, WWE's focus has shifted away from delivering their events on PPV channels. Their main focus now is delivering all of the events on the WWE Network, including some that are exclusively on the Network. WWE has pushed the Network's launching price of [[United States dollar|US$]]9.99 monthly<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/wwenetwork|title=WWE Network Subscription - Free Trial|website=www.wwe.com}}</ref> as a way to lure potential customers away from traditional PPV which, on average, costs five to six times as much (in the United States) as the Network. The WWE Network also features the back catalog of WWE, [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]], and ECW PPV events, as well as all WWE Network exclusive events from [[NXT Arrival]] onwards in their on-demand section. All WWE Network events that have aired since the launch of the Network have been broadcast in high-definition.<ref name=LATIMES>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-wwe-network-20140108,0,2623775.story#axzz2ps4J4oVv|title=WWE launching over-the-top network|last=Flint|first=Joe|work=Los Angeles Times|date=January 8, 2014|accessdate=January 8, 2014}}</ref> Since the second brand extension in July 2016, brand-exclusive PPVs returned with only the \"Big Four\" as the only PPVs to feature both Raw and SmackDown brands.

In Canada, WWE PPVs are available through (depending on service provider) [[Vu!]], [[Shaw PPV]], or [[SaskTel|SaskTel PPV]], and can be seen in movie theatres in HD through selected locations of the [[Cineplex Entertainment]] chain, a practice dating to the [[Famous Players]] ownership by [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]]. In Australia, WWE's pay-per-views are shown on [[Main Event]]. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, all PPVs are shown on Sky Sports Box Office. In India and South Asia, a single broadcaster (currently [[Sony TEN]]) generally holds the rights to all WWE programming,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/schedules/television/india |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222151034/http://www.wwe.com/schedules/television/india |archivedate=December 22, 2015 |df= }}</ref> including PPVs, and they are broadcast for no additional charge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/howtowatch|title=WWE.com: The Official Site of the WWE Universe|author=|date=|work=WWE}}</ref>\n\nCurrently, WWE PPV events are typically 3\u00bd hours to 4 hours in length, while WWE's WrestleMania events are approximately 5 to 5\u00bd hours in length.

The company's PPV lineup expanded to a monthly basis in the mid-1990s before expanding even further in the early-2000s. Aside from its standard monthly schedule, WWE produced additional international PPVs between 1997 and 2003. These events were not available in the United States and coincided with overseas tours in the United Kingdom. Following WWE's original [[WWE brand extension|brand extension]] in 2002, the company promoted two touring rosters representing its [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] television programs. The traditional \"Big Four\" continued to showcase the entire roster, while the remaining PPV events alternated between Raw and SmackDown cards. A special [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|ECW]] PPV in 2005 led to the creation of an [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW brand]] in 2006, which also received its own dedicated PPV events. In March 2007, WWE announced that all subsequent PPV events would feature performers from all brands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2007/2007_03_14.jsp |accessdate=December 1, 2007 |title=WWE Pay-Per-Views to follow WrestleMania formula |publisher=WWE |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319234707/http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2007/2007_03_14.jsp |archivedate=March 19, 2007 |df= }}</ref> In 2008, all WWE PPV events began broadcasting in [[High-definition television|high-definition]].\n\nThe company's PPV business began to drastically change with the launch of the WWE Network on February 24, 2014. While most of the WWE events still air in many parts of the world on traditional PPV channels, WWE's focus has shifted away from delivering their events on PPV channels. Their main focus now is delivering all of the events on the WWE Network, including some that are exclusively on the Network. WWE has pushed the Network's launching price of [[United States dollar|US$]]9.99 monthly<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/wwenetwork|title=WWE Network Subscription - Free Trial|website=www.wwe.com}}</ref> as a way to lure potential customers away from traditional PPV which, on average, costs five to six times as much (in the United States) as the Network. The WWE Network also features the back catalog of WWE, [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]], and ECW PPV events, as well as all WWE Network exclusive events from [[NXT Arrival]] onwards in their on-demand section. All WWE Network events that have aired since the launch of the Network have been broadcast in high-definition.<ref name=LATIMES>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-wwe-network-20140108,0,2623775.story#axzz2ps4J4oVv|title=WWE launching over-the-top network|last=Flint|first=Joe|work=Los Angeles Times|date=January 8, 2014|accessdate=January 8, 2014}}</ref> Since the second brand extension in July 2016, brand-exclusive PPVs returned with only the \"Big Four\" as the only PPVs to feature both Raw and SmackDown brands. Just like the previous brand extension, brand exclusive PPVs ended after [[WrestleMania 34]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wwe.com/article/wwe-2018-pay-per-view-schedule|title=WWE pay-per-views just got bigger for 2018!|work=WWE|access-date=2018-12-02|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the WWE Network, WWE PPVs are still made available on traditional PPV outlets in the United States by [[In Demand]]. In Canada, WWE PPVs are available through (depending on service provider) [[Vu!]], [[Shaw PPV]], or [[SaskTel|SaskTel PPV]], and can be seen in movie theatres in HD through selected locations of the [[Cineplex Entertainment]] chain, a practice dating to the [[Famous Players]] ownership by [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]]. In Australia, WWE's pay-per-views are shown on [[Main Event]]. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, all PPVs are shown on Sky Sports Box Office. In India and South Asia, a single broadcaster (currently [[Sony TEN]]) generally holds the rights to all WWE programming,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/schedules/television/india |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222151034/http://www.wwe.com/schedules/television/india |archivedate=December 22, 2015 |df= }}</ref> including PPVs, and they are broadcast for no additional charge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/howtowatch|title=WWE.com: The Official Site of the WWE Universe|author=|date=|work=WWE}}</ref>\n\nCurrently, WWE PPV events are typically 3\u00bd hours to 4 hours in length, while WWE's WrestleMania events are approximately 5 to 5\u00bd hours in length.

In the series, teams compete in a tournament of finding connections between seemingly unrelated clues. The phrase \"Only connect\" was taken from [[E. M. Forster]]'s 1910 novel ''[[Howards End]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/connect-love-affair-tvs-brainiest-quiz-show/|title=Only Connect: my love-affair with TV's brainiest quiz show|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|last=Lawrence|first=Ben|url-access=subscription|date=27 October 2018|accessdate=2 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n''Only Connect'' aired on [[BBC Four]] from 15 September 2008 to 7 July 2014, before moving to [[BBC Two]] from 1 September 2014. From 2008 until 2013 the show was recorded in Studio 1 at the [[ITV Wales]] Studios based at [[Culverhouse Cross]] in [[Cardiff]], which have now been demolished. It moved temporarily to [[Roath Lock]] Studios in Cardiff in late 2013, before settling in Enfys Studios in Cardiff from 2014 onwards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enfys.co.uk/credits/|title=Credits|publisher=Enfys HD TV Studios}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvstudiohistory.co.uk/rest%20of%20britain.htm |title=The rest of the UK \u2013 today (more or less) |work=An incomplete history of London's television studios |first=Martin |last=Kempton |accessdate=24 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Format ==\n{{image frame|content={{aligned table|cols=3|colstyle=vertical-align:middle|<hiero>M17*M17</hiero>|<hiero>E23</hiero>|<hiero>V28</hiero>|<hiero>I9</hiero>|<hiero>N35:N35:N35</hiero>|<hiero>D10</hiero>}}|caption=Question labels<br />in [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]]}}\n\n''Only Connect'' is deliberately difficult,<ref name=\"Sunderland\">{{cite web |title=Sunderland quiz captain takes on TV\u2019s Only Connect |url=https://www.sunderlandecho.com/news/sunderland-quiz-captain-takes-on-tv-s-only-connect-1-5922983 |newspaper=Sunderland Echo |accessdate=29 April 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"nerd pride\">{{cite web |title=Victoria Coren Mitchell on nerd pride and finding Only Connect\u2019s niche |url=https://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-12-05/victoria-coren-mitchell-on-nerd-pride-and-finding-only-connects-niche/ |newspaper=Radio Times |accessdate=29 April 2019}}</ref> and its contestants are often characterized \u2013 including within the show itself \u2013 as [[nerd]]y or geeky.<ref name=\"nerd pride\"/><ref name=\"whipsmart\">{{cite web |last1=Butter |first1=Susannah |title=Only Connect: Warmth and humour make whip-smart Victoria Coren-Mitchell queen of the quizzes |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/stayingin/tvfilm/only-connect-warmth-and-humour-make-whipsmart-victoria-corenmitchell-queen-of-the-quizzes-a3974731.html |newspaper=Evening Standard |accessdate=29 April 2019}}</ref> Teams are encouraged to take names which reflect specialist interests or hobbies, such as the '[[LARP|LARPers]]' or 'Francophiles'.<ref name=\"whipsmart\" /><ref name=\"Sunderland\" /> The show's questions will cover any topic, and many may require knowledge of both arcane subject areas and popular culture.

In the first three series, clues in Rounds 1 and 2 and the connecting walls in Round 3 were identified by [[Greek alphabet|Greek letters]]. In series 4 Coren Mitchell announced that this idea had been dropped, ostensibly due to viewer complaints that it was too pretentious. Henceforth [[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[hieroglyphs]] ([[List of hieroglyphs/M|two reeds]], [[Lion-reclining (hieroglyph)|lion]], [[Wick (hieroglyph)|twisted flax]], [[Viper (hieroglyph)|horned viper]], [[N-water ripple (n hieroglyph)|water]] and the [[eye of Horus]]) would be used instead. The show's opening sequence displayed Greek letters in the first episode of Series 4, but these were replaced with the hieroglyphs in subsequent episodes.\n\nSeries 1\u20136 had a straight [[round-robin tournament|round-robin]] \"knockout\" format, which was then modified to a [[double-elimination tournament]], in a rule change that Coren Mitchell said that even she did not fully understand. Series 12\u201313 shifted to a format identical to ''[[University Challenge]]'', with a knockout first round combined with a [[repechage]] for the best performing losers and double-elimination quarter-finals. The number of competing teams has fluctuated: 16 in series 1, 3\u20136, 10\u201311 and 14; 8 teams in series 2,8 and 9; and 24 in series 12\u201313. The difficulty of questions generally increases by each round.\n\n=== Round 1: Connections ===\nTeams are given up to four clues and must try to figure out the connection between them within 40 seconds. The team is initially shown one clue, and may request the remaining three clues at any time within the 40 seconds (they are not automatically shown). The team may press their buzzer to guess after the first clue for 5 points, the second for 3, the third for 2, or the fourth for 1. If the team guesses incorrectly, or fails to buzz within the time allotted, the question is posed to the other team for a bonus point, after being shown any remaining clues. Typically, one of the six puzzles involves pictures, and another uses pieces of music, both classical and contemporary. Music questions are generally considered among the toughest questions in the quiz, and a team's dismay upon realising they have chosen the music question is a frequent source of humour on the programme.\n\n[[File:Only Connect Round 1.png|thumb|605px|center|alt=The image shows four boxes arranged in a horizontal line, containing sequential clues of \"A hammer and feather\", \"Six US flags\", \"Eugene Shoemaker's ashes\" and \"Two golf balls\".|Example Puzzle for Round 1. To earn points on this puzzle, teams would have to provide the answer \"Items left on the Moon\" (or a variant thereof).]]\n\n=== Round 2: Sequences ===\nEach set of clues is now a sequence, and teams must try to figure out the fourth item in the sequence (therefore, the team will only be able to see three clues), again as early as possible. They must give the final item in the sequence, and score points even if their theory for the connection is incorrect. As in the previous round, each team will play three sets; again, if one team fails to guess, it is thrown over to the other team, who can see any remaining clues and earn one point by guessing correctly.  As in Round 1, one of the sets of clues involves pictures. Starting from the quarterfinals of Series 10, there is occasionally a sequence made by three music clips, and the contestants must supply the title of the fourth unplayed music clip.\n\nFor example, sequential clues of \"Anger\", \"Bargaining\" and \"Depression\" would be correctly followed by \"Acceptance\", these being the 2nd through 5th stages of the [[K\u00fcbler-Ross model]] of grief.\n\n=== Round 3: Connecting Wall ===\n[[File:Only Connect Round3 Unsolved.png|thumb|An example \"Connecting Wall\" puzzle. The answer requires dividing the items into \"Terms for zero\", \"Poker terms\", \"Flying ___\" and \"Things made of rubber\".]]\nEach team receives a wall of 16 clues and must figure out a perfect solution, consisting of four groups of four connected items. The puzzles are designed to include [[red herrings]] and to suggest more connections than actually exist, as some clues appear to fit into more than one category.<ref name=\"questions\" /> Teams score 1 point for each group found within 2 minutes 30 seconds. They try to create one group at a time, and may make unlimited guesses on the first two groups. Once two groups have been identified, they only have three chances to identify the remaining two groups.\n\nShould the team fail to complete the wall, the missing groupings are shown. Teams can then earn 1 point per group for identifying the connection, regardless of whether they correctly identified the grouping. A team that identifies all four groups and all four connections earns a 2-point bonus, for a total of 10 points. Unlike the previous two rounds, teams have no opportunity to score on their opponents' wall.\n\nOn 1 March 2010, an interactive online version of this round was put on the Only Connect website.<ref name=\"play\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/onlyconnect/quiz |title=Play Only Connect |publisher=BBC Four |accessdate=8 December 2011}}</ref> From mid-2011, coinciding with series 5, the website took online submissions for new Connecting Walls; the online game was discontinued for series 10.\n\n=== Round 4: Missing Vowels ===\nIn a final buzzer round, the teams are presented with a series of word puzzles. The category of the puzzles is given before they are displayed, and each category contains a maximum of four puzzles. Each puzzle is a word or phrase with the vowels removed and the spaces shifted to disguise the original words. For example, in a category of \"Booker Prize-winning novels\", a puzzle of \"VR NNGDLT TL\" would be correctly answered as \"''[[Vernon God Little]]''\".\n\nTeams answer simultaneously using buzzers, and score 1 point for each puzzle they solve. Initially there was no penalty for guessing incorrectly on this round, but starting with the quarter-finals in Series 1, teams have faced a penalty of 1 point for each incorrect answer. Additionally, if the team that buzzes provides an incorrect answer (even by a single letter) or fails to answer quickly, the opposing team is given an opportunity to answer for a bonus point.\n\nThe round lasts for between 90 seconds and three minutes. The team with the most points at the end of the game is the winner. If teams are tied, then a single sudden-death puzzle is given to the captains of each team. If a captain buzzes in first and gives the correct answer then their team wins, but an incorrect answer automatically forfeits the game. Although no category is officially given, they make reference to their own role as sudden-death questions. Examples are \"So Long and Thanks for All the Fish\", \"To the Victor, the Spoils\" and \"Winner Stays On\".\n\n== Champions and runners-up ==\n*'''Series 1''' Champions: Crossworders (Mark Grant,<ref name=\"Crossworders\">{{cite web |last1=Stainer |first1=David |title=Only Connect: How I became a champion of champions |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/tv/entries/e504b054-8ce6-3120-97bf-90e05f25dd49 |website=BBC Blog |accessdate=1 November 2018 |date=19 July 2013}}</ref> [[David Stainer]],<ref name=\"Crossworders\"/> [[Ian Bayley]]<ref name=\"Crossworders\"/>) \n**Runners-Up: Lapsed Psychologists (Richard McDougall<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://next-episode.net/only-connect/season-1|title=Only Connect TV Show - Season 1 Episodes List - Next Episode|website=next-episode.net|language=en|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://jacksonlinewritings.blogspot.com/2015/05/only-connect-series-1-match-1-lapsed.html|title=Jack's Online Writings: Only Connect Series 1: Match 1: Lapsed Psychologists vs Knitters|last=Jack|date=2015-05-20|website=Jack's Online Writings|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>, Jack Waley-Cohen<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />, Matthew Stevens<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />)\n\n*'''Series 2''' Champions: Rugby Boys (Richard Parnell,<ref name=\"RugbyBoys\">{{cite web |last1=McCarthy |first1=James |title=Rugby boys take on Cambridge swots in high-brown TV quiz |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/rugby-boys-take-cambridge-swots-2090954 |website=Wales Online |accessdate=1 November 2018 |date=28 August 2009}}</ref> Gary Dermody,<ref name=\"RugbyBoys\"/> [[Mark Labbett]]<ref name=\"RugbyBoys\"/>)\n**Runners-Up: Cambridge Quiz Society (Paul Beecher<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://next-episode.net/only-connect/season-2|title=Only Connect TV Show - Season 2 Episodes List - Next Episode|website=next-episode.net|language=en|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Citation|title=Episode #2.8|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1501553/|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>, Simon Spiro<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" />, Joshua Karton<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" />)\n\n*'''Series 3''' Champions: Gamblers ([[Jenny Ryan]],<ref>{{cite web |title=About Jenny Ryan |url=http://www.jennyvixenryan.com/about/ |website=jennyvixenryan.com |accessdate=1 November 2018}}</ref> Dave Bill,<ref name=\"OnlyConnectUKGameShows\" /> Alan Gibbs<ref name=\"OnlyConnectUKGameShows\">{{cite web |title=Only Connect (2) |url=http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Only_Connect_(2) |website=ukgameshows.com |accessdate=1 November 2018}}</ref>)\n**Runners-Up: Strategists (Chris Cummins<ref name=\":4\">{{Citation|title=Episode #3.15|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1636222/|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>, Michael Dnes<ref name=\":4\" />, Sarah Higgins<ref name=\":4\" />)\n\n*'''Series 4''' Champions: Epicureans (David Brewis,<ref name=\"OnlyConnectUKGameShows\" /> Katie Bramall-Stainer,<ref name=\"OnlyConnectUKGameShows\" /> [[Aaron Bell (politician)|Aaron Bell]]<ref name=\"OnlyConnectUKGameShows\" />[[Aaron Bell (politician)|)]]\n**Runners-Up: Radio Addicts (Dave Clark<ref name=\":5\">{{Citation|title=Episode #4.17|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1802989/|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>, Gary Grant<ref name=\":5\" />, Neil Phillips<ref name=\":5\" />)\n\n*'''Series 5''' Champions: Analysts (Paul Steeples,<ref name=\"OnlyConnectUKGameShows\" /> David Lea,<ref name=\"OnlyConnectUKGameShows\" /> William De Ath<ref name=\"OnlyConnectUKGameShows\" />)\n**Runners-Up: Antiquarians (Simon Belcher<ref name=\":6\">{{Citation|title=Episode #5.17|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2129506/|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>, Will Howells<ref name=\":6\" />, Debbie Challis<ref name=\":6\" />)\n\n*'''Series 6''' Champions: Scribes (Holly Pattenden,<ref>{{cite web |title=Holly Pattenden |url=http://archive.battleofideas.org.uk/2013/speaker_detail/8096/ |website=Battle of Ideas |accessdate=1 November 2018 |date=2013}}</ref> Dom Tait,<ref name=\"OnlyConnectUKGameShows\" /> Gareth Price<ref>{{cite web |title=\"Good luck to this week's Team Captain of the Scribes, Dom Tait, who gets married tomorrow!

Connect''\n}}\n\n'''''Only Connect''''' is a British television quiz show presented by [[Victoria Coren Mitchell]]. In the series, teams compete in a tournament of finding connections between seemingly unrelated clues. The phrase \"Only connect\" was taken from [[E. M. Forster]]'s 1910 novel ''[[Howards End]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/connect-love-affair-tvs-brainiest-quiz-show/|title=Only Connect: my love-affair with TV's brainiest quiz show|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|last=Lawrence|first=Ben|url-access=subscription|date=27 October 2018|accessdate=2 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n''Only Connect'' aired on [[BBC Four]] from 15 September 2008 to 7 July 2014, before moving to [[BBC Two]] from 1 September 2014. From 2008 until 2013 the show was recorded in Studio 1 at the [[ITV Wales]] Studios based at [[Culverhouse Cross]] in [[Cardiff]], which have now been demolished. It moved temporarily to [[Roath Lock]] Studios in Cardiff in late 2013, before settling in Enfys Studios in Cardiff from 2014 onwards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enfys.co.uk/credits/|title=Credits|publisher=Enfys HD TV Studios}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvstudiohistory.co.uk/rest%20of%20britain.htm |title=The rest of the UK \u2013 today (more or less) |work=An incomplete history of London's television studios |first=Martin |last=Kempton |accessdate=24 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Format ==\n{{image frame|content={{aligned table|cols=3|colstyle=vertical-align:middle|<hiero>M17*M17</hiero>|<hiero>E23</hiero>|<hiero>V28</hiero>|<hiero>I9</hiero>|<hiero>N35:N35:N35</hiero>|<hiero>D10</hiero>}}|caption=Question labels<br />in [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]]}}\n\n''Only Connect'' is deliberately difficult,<ref name=\"Sunderland\">{{cite web |title=Sunderland quiz captain takes on TV\u2019s Only Connect |url=https://www.sunderlandecho.com/news/sunderland-quiz-captain-takes-on-tv-s-only-connect-1-5922983 |newspaper=Sunderland Echo |accessdate=29 April 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"nerd pride\">{{cite web |title=Victoria Coren Mitchell on nerd pride and finding Only Connect\u2019s niche |url=https://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-12-05/victoria-coren-mitchell-on-nerd-pride-and-finding-only-connects-niche/ |newspaper=Radio Times |accessdate=29 April 2019}}</ref> and its contestants are often characterized \u2013 including within the show itself \u2013 as [[nerd]]y or geeky.<ref name=\"nerd pride\"/><ref name=\"whipsmart\">{{cite web |last1=Butter |first1=Susannah |title=Only Connect: Warmth and humour make whip-smart Victoria Coren-Mitchell queen of the quizzes |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/stayingin/tvfilm/only-connect-warmth-and-humour-make-whipsmart-victoria-corenmitchell-queen-of-the-quizzes-a3974731.html |newspaper=Evening Standard |accessdate=29 April 2019}}</ref> Teams are encouraged to take names which reflect specialist interests or hobbies, such as the '[[LARP|LARPers]]' or 'Francophiles'.<ref name=\"whipsmart\" /><ref name=\"Sunderland\" /> The show's questions will cover any topic, and many may require knowledge of both arcane subject areas and popular culture.

In the first three series, clues in Rounds 1 and 2 and the connecting walls in Round 3 were identified by [[Greek alphabet|Greek letters]]. In series 4 Coren Mitchell announced that this idea had been dropped, ostensibly due to viewer complaints that it was too pretentious. Henceforth [[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[hieroglyphs]] ([[List of hieroglyphs/M|two reeds]], [[Lion-reclining (hieroglyph)|lion]], [[Wick (hieroglyph)|twisted flax]], [[Viper (hieroglyph)|horned viper]], [[N-water ripple (n hieroglyph)|water]] and the [[eye of Horus]]) would be used instead. The show's opening sequence displayed Greek letters in the first episode of Series 4, but these were replaced with the hieroglyphs in subsequent episodes.\n\nSeries 1\u20136 had a straight [[round-robin tournament|round-robin]] \"knockout\" format, which was then modified to a [[double-elimination tournament]], in a rule change that Coren Mitchell said that even she did not fully understand. Series 12\u201313 shifted to a format identical to ''[[University Challenge]]'', with a knockout first round combined with a [[repechage]] for the best performing losers and double-elimination quarter-finals. The number of competing teams has fluctuated: 16 in series 1, 3\u20136, 10\u201311 and 14; 8 teams in series 2,8 and 9; and 24 in series 12\u201313. The difficulty of questions generally increases by each round.\n\n=== Round 1: Connections ===\nTeams are given up to four clues and must try to figure out the connection between them within 40 seconds. The team is initially shown one clue, and may request the remaining three clues at any time within the 40 seconds (they are not automatically shown). The team may press their buzzer to guess after the first clue for 5 points, the second for 3, the third for 2, or the fourth for 1. If the team guesses incorrectly, or fails to buzz within the time allotted, the question is posed to the other team for a bonus point, after being shown any remaining clues. Typically, one of the six puzzles involves pictures, and another uses pieces of music, both classical and contemporary. Music questions are generally considered among the toughest questions in the quiz, and a team's dismay upon realising they have chosen the music question is a frequent source of humour on the programme.\n\n[[File:Only Connect Round 1.png|thumb|605px|center|alt=The image shows four boxes arranged in a horizontal line, containing sequential clues of \"A hammer and feather\", \"Six US flags\", \"Eugene Shoemaker's ashes\" and \"Two golf balls\".|Example Puzzle for Round 1. To earn points on this puzzle, teams would have to provide the answer \"Items left on the Moon\" (or a variant thereof).]]\n\n=== Round 2: Sequences ===\nEach set of clues is now a sequence, and teams must try to figure out the fourth item in the sequence (therefore, the team will only be able to see three clues), again as early as possible. They must give the final item in the sequence, and score points even if their theory for the connection is incorrect. As in the previous round, each team will play three sets; again, if one team fails to guess, it is thrown over to the other team, who can see any remaining clues and earn one point by guessing correctly.  As in Round 1, one of the sets of clues involves pictures. Starting from the quarterfinals of Series 10, there is occasionally a sequence made by three music clips, and the contestants must supply the title of the fourth unplayed music clip.\n\nFor example, sequential clues of \"Anger\", \"Bargaining\" and \"Depression\" would be correctly followed by \"Acceptance\", these being the 2nd through 5th stages of the [[K\u00fcbler-Ross model]] of grief.\n\n=== Round 3: Connecting Wall ===\n[[File:Only Connect Round3 Unsolved.png|thumb|An example \"Connecting Wall\" puzzle. The answer requires dividing the items into \"Terms for zero\", \"Poker terms\", \"Flying ___\" and \"Things made of rubber\".]]\nEach team receives a wall of 16 clues and must figure out a perfect solution, consisting of four groups of four connected items. The puzzles are designed to include [[red herrings]] and to suggest more connections than actually exist, as some clues appear to fit into more than one category.<ref name=\"questions\" /> Teams score 1 point for each group found within 2 minutes 30 seconds. They try to create one group at a time, and may make unlimited guesses on the first two groups. Once two groups have been identified, they only have three chances to identify the remaining two groups.\n\nShould the team fail to complete the wall, the missing groupings are shown. Teams can then earn 1 point per group for identifying the connection, regardless of whether they correctly identified the grouping. A team that identifies all four groups and all four connections earns a 2-point bonus, for a total of 10 points. Unlike the previous two rounds, teams have no opportunity to score on their opponents' wall.\n\nOn 1 March 2010, an interactive online version of this round was put on the Only Connect website.<ref name=\"play\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/onlyconnect/quiz |title=Play Only Connect |publisher=BBC Four |accessdate=8 December 2011}}</ref> From mid-2011, coinciding with series 5, the website took online submissions for new Connecting Walls; the online game was discontinued for series 10.\n\n=== Round 4: Missing Vowels ===\nIn a final buzzer round, the teams are presented with a series of word puzzles. The category of the puzzles is given before they are displayed, and each category contains a maximum of four puzzles. Each puzzle is a word or phrase with the vowels removed and the spaces shifted to disguise the original words. For example, in a category of \"Booker Prize-winning novels\", a puzzle of \"VR NNGDLT TL\" would be correctly answered as \"''[[Vernon God Little]]''\".\n\nTeams answer simultaneously using buzzers, and score 1 point for each puzzle they solve. Initially there was no penalty for guessing incorrectly on this round, but starting with the quarter-finals in Series 1, teams have faced a penalty of 1 point for each incorrect answer. Additionally, if the team that buzzes provides an incorrect answer (even by a single letter) or fails to answer quickly, the opposing team is given an opportunity to answer for a bonus point.\n\nThe round lasts for between 90 seconds and three minutes. The team with the most points at the end of the game is the winner. If teams are tied, then a single sudden-death puzzle is given to the captains of each team. If a captain buzzes in first and gives the correct answer then their team wins, but an incorrect answer automatically forfeits the game. Although no category is officially given, they make reference to their own role as sudden-death questions. Examples are \"So Long and Thanks for All the Fish\", \"To the Victor, the Spoils\" and \"Winner Stays On\".\n\n== Champions and Runners-up ==\n*'''Series 1''' Champions: Crossworders (Mark Grant,<ref name=\"Crossworders\">{{cite web |last1=Stainer |first1=David |title=Only Connect: How I became a champion of champions |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/tv/entries/e504b054-8ce6-3120-97bf-90e05f25dd49 |website=BBC Blog |accessdate=1 November 2018 |date=19 July 2013}}</ref> [[David Stainer]],<ref name=\"Crossworders\"/> [[Ian Bayley]]<ref name=\"Crossworders\"/>) \n**Runners-Up: Lapsed Psychologists (Richard McDougall<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://next-episode.net/only-connect/season-1|title=Only Connect TV Show - Season 1 Episodes List - Next Episode|website=next-episode.net|language=en|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://jacksonlinewritings.blogspot.com/2015/05/only-connect-series-1-match-1-lapsed.html|title=Jack's Online Writings: Only Connect Series 1: Match 1: Lapsed Psychologists vs Knitters|last=Jack|date=2015-05-20|website=Jack's Online Writings|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>, Jack Waley-Cohen<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />, Matthew Stevens<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />)\n\n*'''Series 2''' Champions: Rugby Boys (Richard Parnell,<ref name=\"RugbyBoys\">{{cite web |last1=McCarthy |first1=James |title=Rugby boys take on Cambridge swots in high-brown TV quiz |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/rugby-boys-take-cambridge-swots-2090954 |website=Wales Online |accessdate=1 November 2018 |date=28 August 2009}}</ref> Gary Dermody,<ref name=\"RugbyBoys\"/> [[Mark Labbett]]<ref name=\"RugbyBoys\"/>)\n**Runners-Up: Cambridge Quiz Society (Paul Beecher<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://next-episode.net/only-connect/season-2|title=Only Connect TV Show - Season 2 Episodes List - Next Episode|website=next-episode.net|language=en|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Citation|title=Episode #2.8|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1501553/|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>, Simon Spiro<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" />, Joshua Karton<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" />)\n\n*'''Series 3''' Champions: Gamblers ([[Jenny Ryan]],<ref>{{cite web |title=About Jenny Ryan |url=http://www.jennyvixenryan.com/about/ |website=jennyvixenryan.com |accessdate=1 November 2018}}</ref> Dave Bill,<ref name=\"OnlyConnectUKGameShows\" /> Alan Gibbs<ref name=\"OnlyConnectUKGameShows\">{{cite web |title=Only Connect (2) |url=http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Only_Connect_(2) |website=ukgameshows.com |accessdate=1 November 2018}}</ref>)\n**Runners-Up: Strategists (Chris Cummins<ref name=\":4\">{{Citation|title=Episode #3.15|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1636222/|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>, Michael Dnes<ref name=\":4\" />, Sarah Higgins<ref name=\":4\" />)\n\n*'''Series 4''' Champions: Epicureans (David Brewis,<ref name=\"OnlyConnectUKGameShows\" /> Katie Bramall-Stainer,<ref name=\"OnlyConnectUKGameShows\" /> [[Aaron Bell (politician)|Aaron Bell]]<ref name=\"OnlyConnectUKGameShows\" />[[Aaron Bell (politician)|)]]\n**Runners-Up: Radio Addicts (Dave Clark<ref name=\":5\">{{Citation|title=Episode #4.17|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1802989/|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>, Gary Grant<ref name=\":5\" />, Neil Phillips<ref name=\":5\" />)\n\n*'''Series 5''' Champions: Analysts (Paul Steeples,<ref name=\"OnlyConnectUKGameShows\" /> David Lea,<ref name=\"OnlyConnectUKGameShows\" /> William De Ath<ref name=\"OnlyConnectUKGameShows\" />)\n**Runners-Up: Antiquarians (Simon Belcher<ref name=\":6\">{{Citation|title=Episode #5.17|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2129506/|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>, Will Howells<ref name=\":6\" />, Debbie Challis<ref name=\":6\" />)\n\n*'''Series 6''' Champions: Scribes (Holly Pattenden,<ref>{{cite web |title=Holly Pattenden |url=http://archive.battleofideas.org.uk/2013/speaker_detail/8096/ |website=Battle of Ideas |accessdate=1 November 2018 |date=2013}}</ref> Dom Tait,<ref name=\"OnlyConnectUKGameShows\" /> Gareth Price<ref>{{cite web |title=\"Good luck to this week's Team Captain of the Scribes, Dom Tait, who gets married tomorrow!

''Relief'' had been originally built in 1902, on the Columbia at [[Blalock, Oregon]], in [[Gilliam County, Oregon|Gilliam County]], and launched and operated as '''''Columbia''''', a much smaller vessel. ''Relief'' was used primarily as a freight carrier, first for about ten years in the [[Inland Empire]] region of Oregon and Washington, hauling wheat and fruit, and after that was operated on the lower Columbia river.\n\nAfter 1918 the owners of ''Relief'' struggled to find cargo, as railroads and especially highway transport cut sharply into the steamboat share of the transport business.  ''Relief'' was seriously damaged in a sinking in late 1924, but was eventually raised, and returned to service for some time.  ''Relief'' was abandoned in 1931.\n\n== Route ==\n===Rapids and portages ===\nIn its natural state, the Columbia river had a [[List of rapids of the Columbia River|many rapids and narrows]] which impeded navigation.  Moving upstream, at [[river mile]] 146.5 were the [[Cascades Rapids]], which were impassable upstream.  Next came [[Celilo Falls]], also known as The Dalles, which were a series of rapids, eddies, and chutes running between river miles 188 and 200.  Between river mile 200 and the mouth of the [[Snake River]], at river mile 325,<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://columbiariverimages.com/Regions/Places/snake_river.html\n | title = Snake River, Washington\n | last = \n | first =\n | date =\n | website = Lewis and Clark\u2019s Columbia River\n | publisher =\n | access-date = 8 Apr 2020\n | quote= }}</ref> the Umatilla Rapids were the most significant barrier to steamboat navigation.\n\nThe river below the Cascades was called the Lower Columbia.  Between the Cascades and The Dalles was the Middle Columbia.  Upstream from The Dalles was called the Upper Columbia. Steamboats could not move upstream (except in rare cases by [[Lining (steamboat)|lining)]] through either Celilo Falls or the Cascades.  In favorable conditions, steamboats could be taken down through the rapids.<ref name = MillsChap6>{{cite book \n| author1-last = Mills \n| author1-first = Randall V. \n| author-link1 = Randall V.

In 1896 the [[Cascades Locks and Canal]] were completed, which effectively joined the lower and middle river for navigation.  The portage railroad around Celilo Falls remained the only way to move steamboat cargo from the upper to the lower Columbia.\n\n===Railroad competition===\nRailroads and steamboats often competed for business.  There once had been steamboats operating on the upper Columbia river, but by 1883, railroad competition had been so successful that all river boats had been driven off the route.<ref name = WheatFleet>{{cite book \n| author1-last = Mills \n| author1-first = Randall V. \n| author-link1 =  \n| title = Sternwheelers up Columbia -- A Century of Steamboating in the Oregon Country\n| isbn = 0-8032-5874-7 \n| chapter = Ch. 8: The Wheat Fleet\n| lccn = 77007161 \n| location =  Lincoln NE \n| publisher = University of Nebraska \n| date = 1947 \n| at = 105-106\n}}</ref>  Wheat farming became widespread in the region in the 1880s and 1890s, and the railroads could not handle the larger and larger wheat crops being produced.<ref name = WheatFleet/>  The Open River Navigation company was formed to meet the demands for transport by wheat farmers and shippers, and it built a number of steamers, including ''Relief''.<ref name = WheatFleet/>\n\n== Construction ==\n''Relief'' was rebuilt from the much smaller stern-wheel steamer ''Columbia'' (US registry 127689), which had been {{convert|77|ft|m|2|lk=on|abbr=on}} feet long, {{convert|20.4|ft|m|2|lk=on|abbr=on}} on the [[Beam (nautical)|beam]], with a depth of hold of {{convert|3.6|ft|m|2|lk=on|abbr=on}} feet.<ref name = 1903mvrList>{{cite book\n| last1 = [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury Dept]], Statistics Bureau \n| title = Annual List of Merchant Vessels\n| volume = 35\n| type = [[Fiscal year|FY]] end Jun 30, 1903\n| location = [[Washington, DC|Wash.

''Relief'' had been originally built in 1902, on the Columbia at [[Blalock, Oregon]], in [[Gilliam County, Oregon|Gilliam County]], and launched and operated as '''''Columbia''''', a much smaller vessel. ''Relief'' was used primarily as a freight carrier, first for about ten years in the [[Inland Empire]] region of Oregon and Washington, hauling wheat and fruit, and after that was operated on the lower Columbia river.\n\nAfter 1918 the owners of ''Relief'' struggled to find cargo, as railroads and especially highway transport cut sharply into the steamboat share of the transport business.  ''Relief'' was seriously damaged in a sinking in late 1924, but was eventually raised, and returned to service for some time.  ''Relief'' was abandoned in 1931.\n\n== Route ==\n===Rapids and portages ===\nIn its natural state, the Columbia river had a [[List of rapids of the Columbia River|many rapids and narrows]] which impeded navigation.  Moving upstream, at [[river mile]] 146.5 were the [[Cascades Rapids]], which were impassable upstream.  Next came [[Celilo Falls]], also known as The Dalles, which were a series of rapids, eddies, and chutes running between river miles 188 and 200.  Between river mile 200 and the mouth of the [[Snake River]], at river mile 325,<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://columbiariverimages.com/Regions/Places/snake_river.html\n | title = Snake River, Washington\n | last = \n | first =\n | date =\n | website = Lewis and Clark\u2019s Columbia River\n | publisher =\n | access-date = 8 Apr 2020\n | quote= }}</ref> the Umatilla Rapids were the most significant barrier to steamboat navigation.\n\nThe river below the Cascades was called the Lower Columbia.  Between the Cascades and The Dalles was the Middle Columbia.  Upstream from The Dalles was called the Upper Columbia. Steamboats could not move upstream (except in rare cases by [[Lining (steamboat)|lining)]] through either Celilo Falls or the Cascades.  In favorable conditions, steamboats could be taken down through the rapids.<ref name = MillsChap6>{{cite book \n| author1-last = Mills \n| author1-first = Randall V. \n| author-link1 = Randall V.

In 1896 the [[Cascades Locks and Canal]] were completed, which effectively joined the lower and middle river for navigation.  The portage railroad around Celilo Falls remained the only way to move steamboat cargo from the upper to the lower Columbia.\n\n===Railroad competition===\nRailroads and steamboats often competed for business.
