Cold cranking in cold climates is the primary reason ethanol fuel is blended with any gasoline fraction.\n\nIn Brazil, ethanol fuel is neat at the pumps, hence [[flexible-fuel vehicle]]s (FFV) including trucks, tractors, motorbikes and mopeds run on E100. The 85% fraction is commonly sold at pumps worldwide (outside the US), and when specifically supplied or sold as E85 is always 85% ethanol (at pumps or in barrel). Having a guaranteed ethanol fraction obviates the need for a vehicle system to calculate best engine tune according to maximise performance and economy.\n\nIn countries like Australia where E85 is always 85% ethanol (and pump fuel with varying fractions is called \"flex fuel\"), performance motoring enthusiasts and motor racing clubs/championships use E85 extensively (without the need for any FFV certification). Use of alcohol (ethanol and methanol) in motor racing history parallels the invention of the automobile, favoured due to inherent combustion characteristics such as high thermal efficiency, raised torque and with some advanced engines, better specific fuel consumption. In the United States, government [[Subsidy|subsidies]] of ethanol in general and E85 in particular have encouraged a growing infrastructure for the retail sale of E85, especially in [[Corn Belt|corn growing states]] in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n==Fuel economy==\n\n===Specific fuel consumption===\nE85 promoters and the Society of Automotive Engineers contend that automotive manufacturers currently fail to equal the fuel consumption of gasoline because they fail to take advantages of characteristics which are superior in ethanol-based fuel blends. They claim that some ethanol engines have already produced 22% more miles per gallon than identical gasoline engines.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Brusstar |first1=M. |title=High Efficiency and Low Emissions from a Port-Injected Engine with Neat Alcohol Fuel |date=2002-10-21 |doi=10.4271/2002-01-2743 |url=https://www.sae.org/publications/technical-papers/content/2002-01-2743/ |publisher=SAE International}}</ref>\n\nEthanol advocates{{Who|date=December 2015}} also state that it is a mistake to base ethanol engine design on gasoline engine design, and that ethanol engines should be based on diesel engine design parameters instead.{{clarify|date=September 2013}} \nUsing this approach, the EPA has produced an ethanol-only engine which achieves much higher brake thermal efficiency levels than gasoline engines achieve.<ref>US EPA/OAR/Office of Transportation & Air Quality/Advanced Technology Division and FEV Engine Technology; Inc. \"Economical, High-Efficiency Engine Technologies for Alcohol Fuels\"</ref>\nMileage is dependent upon the composition of the ethanol-gasoline blend, transmission, state of engine tune (primarily [[Air\u2013fuel ratio|fuel-air mixture]], spark timing and compression ratio). \nIn the United States to offset this difference in fuel consumption in vehicles not optimised for ethanol, legislation has been passed to subsidize its cost.\n\n===Energy value===\nIn contrast, ethanol critics contest the benefits of E85 by focusing on the fact that E85 has 33% [[lower heating value]] compared to the [[higher heating value]] of gasoline. However comparing energy expressed as a value of heat does not reflect the total work from an [[Otto Cycle]]{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}. Because [[Energy content of biofuel|energy content]] does not factor certain latent or specific heat values{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}, nor combustion pressure, so looking at heat alone in the combustion equation does not determine efficiency or work according to the [[laws of thermodynamics]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n==Octane and performance==\n{{Globalize|date=December 2011}}\n[[File:E85 fuel pump 7563 DCA 09 2009.jpg|thumb|E85 fuel dispenser at a regular gasoline station]]\n\n===Use in flexible-fuel vehicles===\nE85 ethanol is used in engines modified to accept higher concentrations of ethanol. In the US such FFVs are designed to run on any mixture of gasoline or ethanol up to 85% ethanol, whereas in countries such as Brazil where the climate is typically warmer, FFV run on neat alcohol. There are a few major differences between FFVs and non-FFVs. One is the elimination of bare [[magnesium]], [[aluminum]], and [[rubber]] parts in the fuel system. [[Fuel injection]] control systems have a wider range of pulse widths to inject up to 34% more fuel (which in turn produces more power). [[Stainless steel]] fuel lines, sometimes lined with plastic, and stainless-steel fuel tanks in place of [[terne]] fuel tanks have been used. In some cases, FFVs use specific engine oil that neutralises acidity. For vehicles with in-tank-mounted fuel pumps, precautions to prevent [[Electric arc|arcing]], as well as [[flame arrestor]]s positioned in the tank's fill pipe, are sometimes used.\n\n===Octane rating===\nAs more effort is put into maximizing an engine to take advantage of E85's higher \"octane\", engines achieve greater power advantages. One car that has higher power on ethanol is the [[Koenigsegg CCXR]], which on ethanol is the fifth-most powerful production car, with 20% more hp on E85 than on gasoline. According to the manufacturer, this is due to the cooling properties of ethanol. E85 has an [[octane rating]] higher than that of regular gasoline's typical rating of 87, or premium gasoline's 91-93.  This allows it to be used in higher-compression engines, which tend to produce more power per unit of displacement than their gasoline counterparts. \nExamples of octane mis-citation can be found at the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association titled \"E85 Facts\"<ref name=IRFA>Iowa Renewable Fuels Association [http://www.iowarfa.org/ethanol_e85facts.php \"E85 Facts\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110530081708/http://www.iowarfa.org/ethanol_e85facts.php |date=2011-05-30 }}</ref> which cites a range of 100-105, and a document at the Texas State Energy Conservation Office titled \"Ethanol\",<ref name=TSECO>Texas State Energy Conservation Office [http://www.seco.cpa.state.tx.us/re_ethanol.htm \"Ethanol\"]</ref> which cites a 113 rating.\n\nSome vehicles can be converted to use E85 despite not being specifically built for it.  Because of the lower heating value E85 has a cooler intake charge\u2014which, coupled with its high stability level from its high octane rating\u2014has also been used as a \"power adder\" in turbocharged performance vehicles.  These modifications have not only resulted in lower GHG emissions, but typically resulted in 10-12% power and torque increase at the wheels. Where the engine was previously knock limited by gasoline, power improvements are as high as 40%.\n\nBecause of its low price (less than $2.00/gal in some places) and high availability in certain areas people have started to turn to using it in place of high-end racing fuels, which typically cost over $10.00/gal.\n\n==Emissions==\nThere are four primary types of pollutants scientists study.  These emissions are hydrocarbons (HC), oxides of nitrogen (NO<sub>x</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). Because E85 is predominantly ethanol, the exhaust emissions are much different from those of regular gasoline. Numerous studies have compared and contrasted the different emissions and the effects these emissions have on the environment, but the tests have been inconclusive. The tests have shown very little consistency if any at all because there are too many variables involved. The make and model of the vehicle, the way in which the ethanol was produced and the vehicle's overall fuel efficiency all play a large role in the overall outcome of each study.<ref name=JAWMA>Journal of the Air & Waste Management Association, Vol. 59 (Issue 8)</ref> To address the problem of inaccuracy, engineers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory combined data from all applicable emissions studies and compiled them into one data set. This compiled set of data showed that on average all emissions that are federally regulated showed a decrease or no statistically relevant difference between E85 and gasoline.<ref name=AE45>Atmospheric Environment, Vol. 45, Issue 39</ref>\n\nEPA's stringent tier-II vehicle emission standards require that FFVs achieve the same low emissions level regardless whether E85 or gasoline is used. However, E85 can further reduce emissions of certain pollutants as compared to conventional gasoline or lower-volume ethanol blends. For example, E85 is less volatile than gasoline or low-volume ethanol blends, which results in fewer evaporative emissions. Using E85 also reduces carbon-monoxide emissions and provides significant reductions in emissions of many harmful toxics, including benzene, a known human carcinogen. However, E85 in certain engine operating conditions may increase emissions of by . EPA is conducting additional analysis to expand our understanding of the emissions impacts of E85.<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208133709/http://www.epa.gov/SmartwayLogistics/growandgo/documents/factsheet-e85.htm |archivedate=2008-12-08 |url=http://www.epa.gov/SmartwayLogistics/growandgo/documents/factsheet-e85.htm |title=SmartwayLogistics |publisher=www.epa.gov|date=December 8, 2008}}</ref>e drhvjooocqWgdw1a2f\n\n==Controversy==\n\n===Economics===\nA study by [[Purdue University]] found that the economic benefit of E85 is highly dependent on the price of [[crude oil]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Economics of Ethanol|url=https://www.extension.purdue.edu/extmedia/ID/ID-339.pdf|publisher=Purdue University}}</ref>\n\n===Food vs. fuel===\n{{Main|Food vs. fuel}}\n{{Globalize|section|USA|2name=the United States|date=March 2019}}\nE85 critics contend that production of ethanol from corn (maize) drives up [[Food vs. fuel|world food prices]], causing corn to be unaffordable or even unavailable.

Corn used to produce ethanol contains a high amount of starch and is not easily digestible by humans, like [[sweet corn]]. American farmers grow more corn than people purchase; there is an annual surplus of corn in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-10/u-s-corn-surplus-seen-larger-than-expected-on-early-harvest.html|title=U.S. Corn-Surplus Seen Larger Than Expected on Early Harvest - Bloomberg|work=[[Bloomberg L.P.]]|accessdate=5 September 2013|url-access=subscription}}</ref>\n\nE85 advocates say that corn prices have increased due to manipulation of the [[Commodity market|commodities markets]] and because American corn companies sell more and more US-grown corn to [[Mexico]] and [[China]], creating more competition for corn buyers, and therefore driving up its price. E85 critics contend that ethanol producers may not reduce [[Greenhouse gas|carbon emissions]] due to the petroleum and natural gas used in raising corn and refining it. E85 advocates reply by pointing to ethanol producers who do not do so, but instead use E85 or [[biodiesel]] fuel to transport E85, and use [[biomass]] as a heat source for the [[distillation]] of ethanol instead of petro-products like natural gas.\n\nSome say that [[cellulosic ethanol]] produced from waste materials or fast growing non-food crops such as [[Panicum virgatum|switchgrass]] is much more beneficial, but not yet economically practical at large scale.  Others say that the world can easily replace all of its use of petroleum by simply making ethanol from the many crops that yield more ethanol per acre than corn yields, with existing technology, not future technology,<ref>''Alcohol Can Be a Gas'' Blume, David 2007 ''Preheating''; pp.&nbsp;406\u2013410, ''Advancement of Ignition Timing'': pp.&nbsp;404, 417-18, 530 ''''Higher Compression with Ethanol''''pp.&nbsp;70, 358-60, 415-19,429, 433-435</ref> and that certain elements in the cellulosic ethanol field are more interested in patent rights than in producing the greatest amount of ethanol at the lowest price point.\n\n==Availability and price==\n{{see also|E85 in the United States|Corn ethanol}}\n[[File:E85 sale 4949 Maryland 03 2009.jpg|thumb|E85 sale 4949 Maryland 03 2009|thumb|right|Opening of an E85 retail pump in [[Maryland]]]]\nE85 is increasingly common in the [[Ethanol fuel in the United States|United States]], mainly in the [[Midwest]] where corn is a major [[agriculture|crop]] and is the primary source material for ethanol-fuel production.

Cold cranking in cold climates is the primary reason ethanol fuel is blended with any gasoline fraction.\n\nIn Brazil, ethanol fuel is neat at the pumps, hence [[flexible-fuel vehicle]]s (FFV) including trucks, tractors, motorbikes and mopeds run on E100. The 85% fraction is commonly sold at pumps worldwide (outside the US), and when specifically supplied or sold as E85 is always 85% ethanol (at pumps or in barrel). Having a guaranteed ethanol fraction obviates the need for a vehicle system to calculate best engine tune according to maximise performance and economy.\n\nIn countries like Australia where E85 is always 85% ethanol (and pump fuel with varying fractions is called \"flex fuel\"), performance motoring enthusiasts and motor racing clubs/championships use E85 extensively (without the need for any FFV certification). Use of alcohol (ethanol and methanol) in motor racing history parallels the invention of the automobile, favoured due to inherent combustion characteristics such as high thermal efficiency, raised torque and with some advanced engines, better specific fuel consumption. In the United States, government [[Subsidy|subsidies]] of ethanol in general and E85 in particular have encouraged a growing infrastructure for the retail sale of E85, especially in [[Corn Belt|corn growing states]] in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n==Fuel economy==\n\n===Specific fuel consumption===\nE85 promoters and the Society of Automotive Engineers contend that automotive manufacturers currently fail to equal the fuel consumption of gasoline because they fail to take advantages of characteristics which are superior in ethanol-based fuel blends. They claim that some ethanol engines have already produced 22% more miles per gallon than identical gasoline engines.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Brusstar |first1=M. |title=High Efficiency and Low Emissions from a Port-Injected Engine with Neat Alcohol Fuel |date=2002-10-21 |doi=10.4271/2002-01-2743 |url=https://www.sae.org/publications/technical-papers/content/2002-01-2743/ |publisher=SAE International}}</ref>\n\nEthanol advocates{{Who|date=December 2015}} also state that it is a mistake to base ethanol engine design on gasoline engine design, and that ethanol engines should be based on diesel engine design parameters instead.{{clarify|date=September 2013}} \nUsing this approach, the EPA has produced an ethanol-only engine which achieves much higher brake thermal efficiency levels than gasoline engines achieve.<ref>US EPA/OAR/Office of Transportation & Air Quality/Advanced Technology Division and FEV Engine Technology; Inc. \"Economical, High-Efficiency Engine Technologies for Alcohol Fuels\"</ref>\nMileage is dependent upon the composition of the ethanol-gasoline blend, transmission, state of engine tune (primarily [[Air\u2013fuel ratio|fuel-air mixture]], spark timing and compression ratio). \nIn the United States to offset this difference in fuel consumption in vehicles not optimised for ethanol, legislation has been passed to subsidize its cost.\n\n===Energy value===\nIn contrast, ethanol critics contest the benefits of E85 by focusing on the fact that E85 has 33% [[lower heating value]] compared to the [[higher heating value]] of gasoline. However comparing energy expressed as a value of heat does not reflect the total work from an [[Otto Cycle]]{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}. Because [[Energy content of biofuel|energy content]] does not factor certain latent or specific heat values{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}, nor combustion pressure, so looking at heat alone in the combustion equation does not determine efficiency or work according to the [[laws of thermodynamics]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n==Octane and performance==\n{{Globalize|date=December 2011}}\n[[File:E85 fuel pump 7563 DCA 09 2009.jpg|thumb|E85 fuel dispenser at a regular gasoline station]]\n\n===Use in flexible-fuel vehicles===\nE85 ethanol is used in engines modified to accept higher concentrations of ethanol. In the US such FFVs are designed to run on any mixture of gasoline or ethanol up to 85% ethanol, whereas in countries such as Brazil where the climate is typically warmer, FFV run on neat alcohol. There are a few major differences between FFVs and non-FFVs. One is the elimination of bare [[magnesium]], [[aluminum]], and [[rubber]] parts in the fuel system. [[Fuel injection]] control systems have a wider range of pulse widths to inject up to 34% more fuel (which in turn produces more power). [[Stainless steel]] fuel lines, sometimes lined with plastic, and stainless-steel fuel tanks in place of [[terne]] fuel tanks have been used. In some cases, FFVs use specific engine oil that neutralises acidity. For vehicles with in-tank-mounted fuel pumps, precautions to prevent [[Electric arc|arcing]], as well as [[flame arrestor]]s positioned in the tank's fill pipe, are sometimes used.\n\n===Octane rating===\nAs more effort is put into maximizing an engine to take advantage of E85's higher \"octane\", engines achieve greater power advantages. One car that has higher power on ethanol is the [[Koenigsegg CCXR]], which on ethanol is the fifth-most powerful production car, with 20% more hp on E85 than on gasoline. According to the manufacturer, this is due to the cooling properties of ethanol. E85 has an [[octane rating]] higher than that of regular gasoline's typical rating of 87, or premium gasoline's 91-93.  This allows it to be used in higher-compression engines, which tend to produce more power per unit of displacement than their gasoline counterparts. \nExamples of octane mis-citation can be found at the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association titled \"E85 Facts\"<ref name=IRFA>Iowa Renewable Fuels Association [http://www.iowarfa.org/ethanol_e85facts.php \"E85 Facts\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110530081708/http://www.iowarfa.org/ethanol_e85facts.php |date=2011-05-30 }}</ref> which cites a range of 100-105, and a document at the Texas State Energy Conservation Office titled \"Ethanol\",<ref name=TSECO>Texas State Energy Conservation Office [http://www.seco.cpa.state.tx.us/re_ethanol.htm \"Ethanol\"]</ref> which cites a 113 rating.\n\nSome vehicles can be converted to use E85 despite not being specifically built for it.  Because of the lower heating value E85 has a cooler intake charge\u2014which, coupled with its high stability level from its high octane rating\u2014has also been used as a \"power adder\" in turbocharged performance vehicles.  These modifications have not only resulted in lower GHG emissions, but typically resulted in 10-12% power and torque increase at the wheels. Where the engine was previously knock limited by gasoline, power improvements are as high as 40%.\n\nBecause of its low price (less than $2.00/gal in some places) and high availability in certain areas people have started to turn to using it in place of high-end racing fuels, which typically cost over $10.00/gal.\n\n==Emissions==\nThere are four primary types of pollutants scientists study.  These emissions are hydrocarbons (HC), oxides of nitrogen (NO<sub>x</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). Because E85 is predominantly ethanol, the exhaust emissions are much different from those of regular gasoline. Numerous studies have compared and contrasted the different emissions and the effects these emissions have on the environment, but the tests have been inconclusive. The tests have shown very little consistency if any at all because there are too many variables involved. The make and model of the vehicle, the way in which the ethanol was produced and the vehicle's overall fuel efficiency all play a large role in the overall outcome of each study.<ref name=JAWMA>Journal of the Air & Waste Management Association, Vol. 59 (Issue 8)</ref> To address the problem of inaccuracy, engineers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory combined data from all applicable emissions studies and compiled them into one data set. This compiled set of data showed that on average all emissions that are federally regulated showed a decrease or no statistically relevant difference between E85 and gasoline.<ref name=AE45>Atmospheric Environment, Vol. 45, Issue 39</ref>\n\nEPA's stringent tier-II vehicle emission standards require that FFVs achieve the same low emissions level regardless whether E85 or gasoline is used. However, E85 can further reduce emissions of certain pollutants as compared to conventional gasoline or lower-volume ethanol blends. For example, E85 is less volatile than gasoline or low-volume ethanol blends, which results in fewer evaporative emissions. Using E85 also reduces carbon-monoxide emissions and provides significant reductions in emissions of many harmful toxics, including benzene, a known human carcinogen. However, E85 in certain engine operating conditions may increase emissions of [[acetaldehyde]]. EPA is conducting additional analysis to expand our understanding of the emissions impacts of E85.<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208133709/http://www.epa.gov/SmartwayLogistics/growandgo/documents/factsheet-e85.htm |archivedate=2008-12-08 |url=http://www.epa.gov/SmartwayLogistics/growandgo/documents/factsheet-e85.htm |title=SmartwayLogistics |publisher=www.epa.gov|date=December 8, 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Controversy==\n\n===Economics===\nA study by [[Purdue University]] found that the economic benefit of E85 is highly dependent on the price of [[crude oil]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Economics of Ethanol|url=https://www.extension.purdue.edu/extmedia/ID/ID-339.pdf|publisher=Purdue University}}</ref>\n\n===Food vs. fuel===\n{{Main|Food vs. fuel}}\n{{Globalize|section|USA|2name=the United States|date=March 2019}}\nE85 critics contend that production of ethanol from corn (maize) drives up [[Food vs. fuel|world food prices]], causing corn to be unaffordable or even unavailable.

E85 critics contend that ethanol producers may not reduce [[Greenhouse gas|carbon emissions]] due to the petroleum and natural gas used in raising corn and refining it. E85 advocates reply by pointing to ethanol producers who do not do so, but instead use E85 or [[biodiesel]] fuel to transport E85, and use [[biomass]] as a heat source for the [[distillation]] of ethanol instead of petro-products like natural gas.\n\nSome say that [[cellulosic ethanol]] produced from waste materials or fast growing non-food crops such as [[Panicum virgatum|switchgrass]] is much more beneficial, but not yet economically practical at large scale.

The Act was passed in order that vehicles could be easily traced in the event of an accident, contravention of the law or any other incident. Vehicle registration alphanumeric plates in the UK are rectangular or square in shape, with the exact permitted dimensions of the plate and its lettering set down in law. Front plates are white, whereas rear plates are yellow.\n\nWithin the UK itself, there are two systems: one for [[Great Britain]], which dates from 2001, and another for [[Northern Ireland]], which is similar to the original 1904 system. Both systems are administered by the [[Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency]] (DVLA) in [[Swansea]]. Until July 2014, Northern Ireland's system was administered by the [[Driver and Vehicle Agency]] (DVA) in [[Coleraine]], which had the same status as the DVLA. Other schemes relating to the UK are also listed below.

The letters '''I''' and '''Q''' are excluded from the three-letter sequence, as are combinations that may appear offensive (including those in foreign languages).

However, a vehicle is permitted to display a number plate where the age identifier is older (but ''not'' newer) than the vehicle. The wide awareness of how the \"age identifier\" works has led to it being used in advertising by used-car showrooms instead of simply stating a year.\n* In the case of a police investigation of an accident or vehicle-related crime, witnesses usually remember the initial area code letters \u2013 it is then quite simple to narrow down suspect vehicles to a much smaller number by checking the authority's database without having to know the full number.<ref>{{citation |url = http://www.speedyreg.co.uk/platehistory |title = History of Number Plates |publisher = Speedy Registrations Co.

The standard design have also incorporated a blue strip on the left side of the plate with the [[Flag of Europe|European Union symbol]] and the [[international vehicle registration code]] of the member state, although this aspect of the design is not compulsory. EU member states that require foreign vehicles to display a distinguishing sign of the country of origin (e.g. 'GB' for the United Kingdom) are obliged by Article 3 of EU Regulation No. 2411/98 to accept this standard design as a distinguishing sign when displayed on a vehicle registered in another member state, making a separate sign unnecessary for vehicles registered in the EU. After the UK ratified the [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]] in 2018, \"Europlates\" should also be valid in other countries party to that convention. \n\nAfter [[Brexit]], and the UK is no longer a member state of the European Union, other EU countries are no longer required to accept UK \"Europlates\", as the regulation only requires member states to accept the standard design as a distinguishing sign when displayed on a vehicle registered in another member state.

However, after the UK ratified the [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]] in 2018, number plates with the distinguishing code \"GB\" featuring the [[Union Jack]] (flag of the UK) should be valid in other countries party to named convention, as such number plate displays a distinguishing code for the country of registration incorporated into the vehicle registration plate, and is supplemented with a flag or emblem of the national state, and hence satisfies the requirements set out in the convention.<ref>https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/conventn/Conv_road_traffic_EN.pdf</ref> \n\nThe European Commission has confirmed that after Brexit, British cars with number plates with the distinguishing sign incorporated do not need a separate sign when driving in EU countries party to the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic.

The width of the previous font was condensed from 57&nbsp;mm to 50&nbsp;mm to allow space for the extra letter and the optional blue EU strip. The letter '''O''' and the digit '''0''' are intentionally identical, as are the letter '''I''' and digit '''1'''. But the typeface accentuates the differences between characters such as '''8''' and '''B''', or '''D''' and '''0''', with [[slab serif]]s to improve the legibility of a plate from a distance. This is especially useful for the [[automatic number plate recognition]] software of [[speed cameras]] and [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]]. This accentuation also discourages the tampering that is sometimes practised with the use of black [[insulating tape]] or paint to change letter forms (such as '''P''' to '''R''', or '''9''' to '''8'''), or with the inclusion of carefully positioned black \"fixing screw\" dots that alter the appearance of letters on some [[vanity plate]]s.\n\nThe design has similarities with the [[FE-Schrift]] number-plate font which was introduced in Germany in 1994 and which has been mandatory there since 2000. However, the UK design remains more conventional in its character shapes.\n\n==== Special plates ====\nRegistrations having a combination of characters that are particularly appealing (resembling a name, for example) are auctioned each year. The first of these auctions was in 1989.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://insidedvla.blog.gov.uk/2014/11/12/25-years-selling-personalised-registrations/|title=25 years selling personalised registrations|first=Damian|last=Lawson|publisher=DVLA|date=12 November 2014|accessdate=3 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.numberplates.com/museum/auctions/14_12_89.asp|title=Number Plate Auction - December 1989|publisher=Numberplates.com|accessdate=3 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nFor the 07 registration period a higher than usual number of Scottish 07 codes were retained as Select registrations for sale and an additional allocation of Tx letter pairs were released for use by the local offices in Scotland with the same allocation as the Sx letter pairs (for example Edinburgh with SK to SN allocated had TK to TN added){{ref label|scotland|a|a}}.<ref name=\"Newall\">{{cite book |last = Newall |first = L.H. |title = A History of Motor Vehicle Registration in the United Kingdom |edition = 3rd |year = 2008 |publisher = Newby Books |location = Scarborough |page = 302 |isbn = 978-1-872686-32-5 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2007 the [[Edinburgh]] DVLA office exceptionally issued <code>TN07</code> prefixed registrations for some vehicles, instead of the expected '<code>SN07</code>'.

Subject to certain conditions, number plates can be transferred between vehicles by the vehicle owner; some of these transfers involve tens or even hundreds of thousands of pounds changing hands, because of the desirability of a specific letter/number combination.\n\n=== History ===\n\n==== Before 1932 ====\n[[File:United Kingdom license plate AH 72 Norfolk 1904-1932 Flickr - woody1778a.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Number plate displaying a vehicle registration mark created between 1903 and 1932]]\nThe first series of number plates was issued in [[Motor Car Act 1903|1903]] and ran until 1932, consisting of a one- or two-letter code followed by a sequence number from 1 to 9999.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.nationalnumbers.co.uk/number-plate-history.htm |title = A Brief History Lesson on Licensing and Registrations |publisher = Nationalnumbers.co.uk |date = 30 November 1983 |accessdate = 30 January 2015 }}</ref> The code indicated the local authority in whose area the vehicle was registered.

London and [[Middlesex]] quickly took most codes with L and M as the first letter respectively, while [[Surrey]], initially allocated <code>P</code>, took many codes beginning with that letter.\n\nThe first mark to be issued in London was the simple, bold, <code>A 1</code> and this was registered to [[Frank Russell, 2nd Earl Russell|Earl Russell]].  He wanted the mark so badly he camped out all night to secure it, making him not only the first registrant but also the inventor of the idea of having a distinctive, personalised or cherished plate on a vehicle.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.speedyreg.co.uk/history-of-number-plates|title=History of Number Plates {{!}} Registration and Car Number Plate History|website=www.speedyreg.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2019-05-22}}</ref>\n\nA zero has been issued by several issuing authorities for the official car of the council head, in cases where plate number \"1\" had already been issued by the time the councils decided to give priority to its first citizen.<ref name=\"niceregzero\">{{cite web |url = http://nice-reg.co.uk/number-plates/number-plates/zero-number-plates.html |title = Zero Number Plates |publisher = Nice-Reg! |accessdate = 22 October 2015 }}</ref> Example include the [[Lord Mayor of London]] (<code>LM&nbsp;0</code><ref name=\"niceregzero\"/><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.st-johns.org.uk/front-pics/lord-mayor-arrives.jpg |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060620185536/http://www.st-johns.org.uk/front-pics/lord-mayor-arrives.jpg |archivedate = 20 June 2006 |title = Lord Mayor arrives at St. John's School |publisher = St. John's School |accessdate = 5 May 2010 }}</ref>) and the Lord Provosts [[Lord Provost of Edinburgh|of Edinburgh]] (<code>S&nbsp;0</code>), [[Lord Provost of Glasgow|of Glasgow]] (<code>G&nbsp;0</code>) and [[Lord Provost of Aberdeen|of Aberdeen]] (<code>RG&nbsp;0</code>).<ref name=\"niceregzero\"/>\n\n==== 1932 to 1963 ====\nBy 1932, the available codes were running out, and an extended scheme was introduced. This scheme placed a serial letter before the code, and had the sequence number run only to 999, thus restricting the number of characters in a registration to six. The first area to issue such marks was [[Staffordshire]] in July 1932 with <code>ARF&nbsp;1</code> etc.,<ref name=\"regnumbers\">{{cite web |url = http://www.fleetdata.co.uk/ukregistrations.html |title = British vehicle registration numbers |publisher = Fleetdata.co.uk |accessdate = 29 December 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100219132653/http://fleetdata.co.uk/ukregistrations.html |archivedate = 19 February 2010 }}</ref> and all other areas in England and Wales, plus most areas in Scotland, followed suit once they had issued all their two-letter registrations.\n\nI, Q, and Z were not used as serial letters, as the use of I and Z continued to be restricted to Ireland and Q was reserved for temporary imports, while the single-letter codes were left out of this scheme as a serial letter would have created a duplicate of an existing two-letter code. (The [[Vehicle registration plates of Ireland#History|Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]] later adopted this scheme in their own ways, and the latter still uses it.)\n\nIn some areas, the available marks within this scheme started to run out in the 1950s, and in those areas, what became known as \"reversed\" registrations \u2013 the letters coming after the numbers \u2013 were introduced. Staffordshire was again the first area to issue such registrations, starting with <code>1000&nbsp;E</code> in 1953. In most cases, the three-letter combinations (e.g. <code>1&nbsp;AHX</code> for [[Middlesex]]) would be issued first, while in later years some areas started with the one- and two-letter combinations and others issued all three at the same time. The ever-increasing popularity of the car meant that by the beginning of the 1960s, these registrations were also running out.\n\nSome three-letter combinations were not authorised for licensing use as they were deemed offensive. These included <code>ARS</code>, <code>BUM</code>, <code>GOD</code>, <code>JEW</code>, <code>SEX</code>, and <code>SOD</code>.<ref>http://www.fergusontractor.co.uk/infofiles/which/regmk.asp  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921180228/http://www.fergusontractor.co.uk/infofiles/which/regmk.asp |date=21 September 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url = http://www.templeoftriumph.org/tsoa/TSOAJan72.pdf |first = Graham W. |last = Whitehead |title = Triumph Sells Record Number of Sportscars |journal = Triumph Sports Owners Association |volume = 18 |issue = 1, January 1972 |accessdate = 30 January 2015 }}</ref> <code>DUW</code> was issued in London for several months in 1934 before it was realised it was the Welsh for God, and withdrawn.<ref name=\"Newall\" />\nEven then, there were some registrations which would now be called cherished plates. One was RAD10 (BBC) and another was IND1A (Indian high commission).\n\n==== 1963 to 1982 ====\nIn August 1962, an attempt was made to create a national scheme to alleviate the problem of registrations running out. This used the scheme introduced in 1932, of a three-letter combination followed by a sequence number from 1 to 999, but also added a letter suffix, which initially changed on 1 January each year. An \"A\" suffix was thus used for 1963, \"B\" for 1964, etc. Middlesex was the first authority to adopt this scheme when it issued <code>AHX&nbsp;1A</code> in February 1963.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~pattle/nacc/arc0607.htm |title = UK registration marks from 1904 to August 2001 |publisher = The Moped Archive |accessdate = 29 December 2010 }}</ref> Most other areas followed suit during 1964, but some chose to stick to their own schemes up until 1 January 1965, when the letter suffix was made compulsory.\n\nAs well as yielding many more available numbers, it was a handy way for vehicle buyers to know the age of the vehicle immediately. However, the year letter changing on 1 January each year meant that car retailers soon started to notice that buyers would tend to wait until the New Year for the new letter to be issued, so that they could get a \"newer\" car. This led to major peaks and troughs in sales over the year, and to help flatten this out somewhat the industry lobbied to get the scheme changed, so that the change of year letter occurred on 1 August rather than 1 January. This was done in 1967, when \"E\" suffixes ran only from 1 January to 31 July, before \"F\" suffixes commenced on 1 August.\n\nAt the beginning, plates were black with white or silver characters. Reflective plates were introduced in 1969 and were white on the front and yellow on the rear with black characters.\n\nIn October 1974, responsibility for issuing registrations was transferred from local and regional authorities to specialist Local Vehicle Licensing Offices (LVLOs) or Vehicle Registration Offices (VROs) run by the DVLA. Most of the two-letter area codes allocated during the first scheme continued in their respective areas, albeit now indicating the nearest LVLO/VRO rather than the local or regional authority. However, the decision to streamline the allocations of these codes meant that some were transferred to new areas. For instance, the former [[Suffolk]] code <code>CF</code> was transferred to [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], while the former [[Edinburgh]] code <code>WS</code> was re-allocated to [[Bristol]].<ref name=\"regnumbers\" />\n\n==== 1983 to 2001 ====\nBy 1982, the year suffixes had reached Y and so from 1983 onwards the sequence was reversed again, so that the year letter \u2013 starting again at \"A\" \u2014 preceded the numbers then the letters of the registration. The available range was then <code>A21&nbsp;AAA</code> to <code>Y999&nbsp;YYY</code>, the numbers 1\u201320 being held back for the government's proposed, and later implemented, DVLA select registration sales scheme.\nTowards the mid-1990s there was some discussion about introducing a unified scheme for Europe, which would also incorporate the country code of origin of the vehicle, but after much debate such a scheme was not adopted because of lack of countries willing to participate.\n[[File:Q-plate on construction vehicle.jpg|thumb|180px|A construction vehicle bearing a Q number plate, August 2016, UK]]\nThe changes in 1983 also brought the letter Q into use \u2013 although on a very small and limited scale. It was used on vehicles of indeterminate age, such as those assembled from kits, substantial rebuilds, or imported vehicles where the documentation is insufficient to determine the age. There was a marked increase in the use of Q registrations in the late 1980s and early 1990s, fuelled by car crime.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Many stolen vehicles had false identities given to them, and when this was discovered and the original identity could not be determined, a Q registration would be issued to such vehicle. It was seen as an aid to consumer protection. Due to indeterminate age, origin and specification of Q registration vehicles, most motor insurers are reluctant to offer cover for these 'Q-plate' vehicles.\n\nBy the late 1990s, the range of available numbers was once again starting to run out, exacerbated by a move to biannual changes in registration letters (March and September) in 1999 to smooth out the bulge in registrations every August, so a new scheme needed to be adopted. It was decided to research a system that would be easier for [[traffic collision|crash]] or vehicle related crime witnesses to remember and clearer to read, yet still fit within a normal standard plate size.\n\n==== Year identifiers ====\nIn order to avoid any confusion, the letters I, O, Q, U and Z have never been issued as year identifiers: I because of its similarity to the numeral 1; O and Q because of similarity to a zero; U because of similarity to the letter V; and Z because of similarity to the numeral 2.\n\n{| style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n||'''Suffix letter series 1963\u201383'''||'''Prefix letter series 1983\u20132001'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\"|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Letter\n! scope=\"col\" | Dates of issue\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | A\n| February 1963<ref name=\"parkers-77\">{{citation |title = Parker's Car Price Guide |date = September 1977 }}</ref> \u2013 31 December 1963\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | B\n| 1 January 1964 \u2013 31 December 1964\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | C\n| 1 January 1965 \u2013 31 December 1965\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | D\n| 1 January 1966 \u2013 31 December 1966\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | E\n| 1 January 1967 \u2013 31 July 1967\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | F\n| 1 August 1967 \u2013 31 July 1968\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | G\n| 1 August 1968 \u2013 31 July 1969\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | H\n| 1 August 1969 \u2013 31 July 1970\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | J\n| 1 August 1970 \u2013 31 July 1971\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | K\n| 1 August 1971 \u2013 31 July 1972\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | L\n| 1 August 1972 \u2013 31 July 1973\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | M\n| 1 August 1973 \u2013 31 July 1974\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | N\n| 1 August 1974 \u2013 31 July 1975\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | P\n| 1 August 1975 \u2013 31 July 1976\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | R\n| 1 August 1976 \u2013 31 July 1977\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | S\n| 1 August 1977 \u2013 31 July 1978\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | T\n| 1 August 1978 \u2013 31 July 1979\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | V\n| 1 August 1979 \u2013 31 July 1980\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | W\n| 1 August 1980 \u2013 31 July 1981\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | X\n| 1 August 1981 \u2013 31 July 1982\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Y\n| 1 August 1982 \u2013 31 July 1983\n|}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\"|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Letter\n! scope=\"col\" | Dates of issue\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | A\n| 1 August 1983 \u2013 31 July 1984\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | B\n| 1 August 1984 \u2013 31 July 1985\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | C\n| 1 August 1985 \u2013 31 July 1986\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | D\n| 1 August 1986 \u2013 31 July 1987\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | E\n| 1 August 1987 \u2013 31 July 1988\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | F\n| 1 August 1988 \u2013 31 July 1989\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | G\n| 1 August 1989 \u2013 31 July 1990\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | H\n| 1 August 1990 \u2013 31 July 1991\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | J\n| 1 August 1991 \u2013 31 July 1992\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | K\n| 1 August 1992 \u2013 31 July 1993\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | L\n| 1 August 1993 \u2013 31 July 1994\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | M\n| 1 August 1994 \u2013 31 July 1995\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | N\n| 1 August 1995 \u2013 31 July 1996\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | P\n| 1 August 1996 \u2013 31 July 1997\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | R\n| 1 August 1997 \u2013 31 July 1998\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | S\n| 1 August 1998 \u2013 28 February 1999\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | T\n| 1 March 1999 \u2013 31 August 1999\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | V\n| 1 September 1999 \u2013 29 February 2000\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | W\n| 1 March 2000 \u2013 31 August 2000\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | X\n| 1 September 2000 \u2013 28 February 2001\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Y\n| 1 March 2001 \u2013 31 August 2001\n|}\n|}\n\n==== Pre-2001 codes ====\n\nNormally the last two letters would indicate where the car was initially registered.

EU bands are not provided, and are uncommon in Northern Ireland, but can be added, although the \"NI\" code is unofficial. This particular plate uses an old-style font.]]\n\nNorthern Ireland uses a modified version of the national system initiated for the whole of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] in 1903, with two-letter county and city codes featuring the letters I or Z representing [[Ireland]]. \n\nAs in Great Britain, each code originally ran from 1 to 9999, and when one was completed, another was allocated. All possible codes had been allocated by 1957, following which reversed sequences were introduced, the first county to do so being [[County Antrim|Antrim]] in January 1958 with <code>1&nbsp;IA</code>. These reversed sequences were completed quickly, leading to the introduction of the current \"<code>AXX&nbsp;1234</code>\" format in January 1966, where \"<code>XX</code>\" is the county code and \"<code>A</code>\" is a serial letter. This format allowed capacity to be increased. Each county adopted it once they had completed their reversed sequences, the last one to do so being [[County Londonderry]] in October 1973 with <code>AIW&nbsp;1</code>. From November 1985, the first 100 numbers of each series were withheld for use as cherished registrations. From April 1989, the numbers 101-999 were also withheld in this way. Even multiples of 1000 and 1111 (\"four-of-a-kind\") are deemed cherished by the DVLA and thus withheld. Each series ends at 9998 and follows on to the next letter/number combination in the series. \n\nWhen the [[Administrative counties of Ireland|administrative counties of Northern Ireland]] were dissolved in 1972, the responsibility for issuing registrations was transferred to the [[Minister of Home Affairs (Northern Ireland)|NI Ministry of Home Affairs]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisro/1973/337/contents/made|title=The Vehicles Excise (Transfer of Functions) (Supplementary Provisions) Order (Northern Ireland) 1973|work=[[Legislation.gov.uk]]|accessdate=4 May 2018}}</ref> and later the [[Department of the Environment (Northern Ireland)|Department of the Environment NI]]. From 21 July 2014, vehicle registration in Northern Ireland became the responsibility of the DVLA in Swansea. The pre-1972 format of Northern Ireland registration plates continues unchanged.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/vehicle-registration-from-21-july-2014 |title = Vehicle registration from 21 July 2014 |publisher = nidirect |accessdate = 15 August 2014 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140916004242/http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/vehicle-registration-from-21-july-2014 |archive-date = 16 September 2014 |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n== Most expensive plates ==\nAs popularity grows, the prices reached for the most expensive plates have increased with many motorists attracted by the investment potential as well as vanity. In the UK, sales of private plates via the Driver & Vehicle Licensing Agency exceeded \u00a3100&nbsp;million per annum for the first time in 2016. Since 1989 the DVLA has made a total of \u00a32&nbsp;billion from selling private plates. While the wealthy may spend more on a private plate than on their personal vehicle, not all car owners are attracted to private plates. This has not affected number plates from appreciating thousands in value each year.\n\nRegistration <code>1</code> sold for \u00a37.25&nbsp;million and is the highest price paid for a plate \u2013 in the [[United Arab Emirates]]. It was purchased by Abu Dhabi businessman Saeed Abdul Ghaffar Khouri in 2008.

Other popular plates include BO55 EGO. It has previously gone on auction in 2016 where the owner rejected the highest asking of \u00a3127,000.\n\nThe popularity of race-related plates led the [[Driver & Vehicle Licensing Agency]] to make a motor racing game to mark the profits it has made from the sales of private plates. The celebration took place at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in 2010.<ref name=\"racergame\">{{cite web |url = http://dvlaregistrations.direct.gov.uk/goodwood2010/ |title = dvla's good wood soapbox reader game |author = dvlaregistrations |date = 2010}}</ref> On 25 January 2008 the registration <code>F1</code> sold for \u00a3440,000 to Bradford Car design [[entrepreneur]] Afzal Kahn. The plate was previously owned and sold by [[Essex County Council]] and was sold to raise money for training young drivers. Today the <code>F1</code> plate has a valuation less than the winning bid with the price tag stagnating on that particular plate.

General trade plates had white letters and numbers on a red background and could be used for all purposes, while limited trade plates used red numbers and letters on a white background and were restricted in their use (e.g. a vehicle being driven under limited trade plates was not allowed to carry passengers). Since 1970, all trade plates have used the red-on-white format.

Eligible officials are required to be accredited by the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) who liaise with Specialist Registrations at the Driver & Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) for issuance. Guidance document: INF267 (4/18) has been produced by the DVLA for accredited officials.\n\nThe distinguishing format is three numbers, space, letter D or X, space and three numbers. The letter D is predominately used for vehicles operated in or around the capital of London with the letter X allocated to vehicles outside London and for international organisations,{{fact|date=November 2018}} unless otherwise stated by bilateral treaty or arrangement. The first group of three numbers identifies the country or international organisation. The second group of three numbers is a serial number sequence starting at 101 for diplomats, 400 for non-diplomatic staff of international organisations, and 700 upwards for consular or other non-diplomatic staff.

For example: United States' embassy is allowed to use the registration USA 1; Zimbabwe's embassy ZIM 1; Jamaica's high commission JAM 1 and South Korea's embassy ROK 1 \u2013 'Republic of Korea'. The North Korean embassy, however, had to buy a vanity plate: PRK 1D.{{fact|date=November 2018}}\n\nDiplomats are exempt from payment of vehicle tax (motor car road fund licence duty).\n\n=== Cherished marks (personal, vanity or private number plates) ===\nBy default, a UK registration plate will accompany a vehicle throughout the vehicle's lifetime. There is no requirement to re-register a vehicle when moving to a new part of the country and no requirement that the number be changed when ownership of the vehicle changes. It is, however, possible for another registration number to be transferred, replacing the one originally issued, where owners wish to have a \"[[vanity plate]]\" (sometimes referred to as a \"cherished\" registration) displaying, for instance, their initials. Registration numbers may also be replaced simply to disguise the actual age of the vehicle.\n\nAccording to information on the government DVLA website:\n\n\"Just remember you can make your vehicle look as old as you wish but you can not make it look newer than it is. For example you cannot put a Y registration number on a T registered vehicle but you could choose any prefix range from an A to a T. Each registration has an issue date which is what you must check to ensure you don't make your vehicle appear newer than it is.\"<ref>{{cite web |url = http://dvlaregistrations.direct.gov.uk/terms/terms-of-sale.html |title = Personalised Registrations: Terms & Conditions of Sale |publisher = [[Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency]] |accessdate = 30 January 2015 }}</ref> However, you are able to put 1955 registered private number plates on a 1949 registered vehicle as there is no year indicator to determine the age of release.\n\nAs many vehicles registered before 1963 have been scrapped, some of their \"dateless\" pre-1963 registration numbers have been transferred to other vehicles as personal plates. They can be valuable, and can also be used to conceal the age of an older vehicle. Many vintage and classic cars no longer bear their original index marks due to the owners being offered high premiums for the desirable registrations. In addition Northern Irish registrations are also regarded as \"dateless\" and are often transferred to vehicles outside Northern Ireland.<ref name=\"New Reg\">{{cite web |title = Northern Irish Registrations |url = http://www.newreg.co.uk/irish-number-plates/ |accessdate = 1 July 2014 }}</ref> Touring coaches often operate in other parts of the UK with registration numbers originally issued in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe DVLA's Personalised Registrations service also allows the purchase and transfer of registration numbers directly from the DVLA.<ref name=\"dvla-pr\">{{cite web |title = DVLA Personalised Registrations |url = http://dvlaregistrations.direct.gov.uk/ |work = [[Directgov]] |publisher = [[DVLA]] |accessdate = 10 September 2010 }}</ref> Many private dealers act as agents for DVLA issues (and sell DVLA numbers for more than the DVLA asking price, which many buyers do not realise), and also hold their own private stock of dateless registrations and other cherished marks.

Some UK embassy vehicles have I or Z in their number plates e.g. CZE (Dublin) 1, PHI (Tipperary) 1, which have originated in the Irish system. Vehicles registered in Ireland under the new system (87 onwards) and which are exported to the UK must de-register their new Irish county (or in many cases, their Irish export ZZ 5 digit plate) with the DVLA who will issue them with a new UK number.\n\n== Fraudulent use ==\nCriminals sometimes use copies of number plates legitimately used on a vehicle of identical type and colour to the one used, known as \"cloning\", to avoid being identified.<ref>[http://www.nationalnumbers.co.uk/articles/man-jailed-for-using-fake-plates-on-stolen-cars-2570] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140117135341/http://www.nationalnumbers.co.uk/articles/man-jailed-for-using-fake-plates-on-stolen-cars-2570|date=17 January 2014}}</ref> A routine police computer check shows the plate matching the type of vehicle and does not appear suspicious.\n\nThe UK Government introduced on 1 August 2008 regulations requiring the production of personal identification and vehicle registration documents when having number plates made by a retailer.<ref name=\"directgovhowto\">{{cite web |url = http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Motoring/BuyingAndSellingAVehicle/PersonalisedRegAndNumberPlates/DG_4022573 |title = How to get a number plate made up |author = Directgov |accessdate = 28 September 2009 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081205022837/http://www.direct.gov.uk./en/Motoring/BuyingAndSellingAVehicle/PersonalisedRegAndNumberPlates/DG_4022573 |archive-date = 5 December 2008 |url-status = dead }}</ref> The organisation that makes the plate is required to display their name and postcode, usually in small print at bottom centre, to aid in tracing false plates and their purchaser.<ref name=\"v796\" /> This requirement was introduced in 2001 when the new character style and two-digit year identifier came into force, and applies to all registration plates made after that date regardless of the year of the vehicle.\n\n== Registration plate suppliers ==\nNumber plates were initially made by the motor vehicle's original supplier, and replacement plates meeting standards could be made by anybody. Some people had street address numbers made up to motor-vehicle standards for their houses. From 2001 plates sold in England and Wales had to be provided by a supplier on the DVLA's Register of Number Plate Suppliers (RNPS) as specified in British Standard BSAU145d. The supplier needs to confirm that the customer is the registered keeper or other authorised person and verify their identity.<ref name=\"directgovhowto\" /> The name and postcode of the supplier must be shown at the bottom of the plate.<ref name=\"v796\" /> Number plates in the UK are usually flat and made of plastic; embossed aluminium plates are available from some suppliers. These rules are generally described as onerous, particularly to company car drivers who do not hold any of the required paperwork themselves (such items usually being stored by a fleet manager or lease hire company).\n\nRegistered number plate suppliers must keep records including the documents produced by their customers; they can be required to be shown to the police, although in reality this has seldom happened. The [[Department for Transport]] holds a full list of suppliers.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.gov.uk/number-plate-supplier |title = Find your nearest number plate supplier |work = gov.uk |year = 2015 |accessdate = 30 January 2015 }}</ref>\n\nSome companies, particularly those based online, sell number plates described as \"show plates\" or \"not for road use\", which may not satisfy the requirements of BSAU145d. However, if so specified, these products can be identical to number plates sold by approved RNPS registered supplier. Many of these companies do not ask customers to prove ownership of the registration they are purchasing, and try to circumvent the law by placing disclaimers on their websites. Despite these disclaimers, it is still not legal to produce any registration plates without seeing proof of identity of the purchaser (such as a driving licence), and proof of their connection to the registration (such as a V5C or retention certificate).<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.plate-trader.com/documents_required.php |title = Documents required from registered number plate suppliers |publisher = Plate-Trader.com |accessdate = 6 May 2014 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Vehicle registration plate]]\n* [[Vehicle registration plates of the European Union]]\n* [[Vehicle registration plates of the Isle of Man]]\n* [[Vehicle registration plates of the Channel Islands]]\n* [[Vehicle registration plates of British overseas territories]]\n* [[Vehicle Excise Duty]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|License plates of the United Kingdom}}\n\n{{Vehicle registration plates of Europe}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vehicle Registration Plates of the United Kingdom}}\n[[Category:Vehicle registration plates of the United Kingdom| ]]\n[[Category:Road transport in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Vehicle registration plates by country|United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:United Kingdom transport-related lists]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|United Kingdom vehicle license plates}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2020}}\n{{Use British English|date=September 2016}}\n{{redirect|British number plates|Northern Ireland|Vehicle registration plates of Northern Ireland|British territories outside the United Kingdom|Vehicle registration plates of the United Kingdom, Crown dependencies and overseas territories}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| total_width = 400\n| image1 = British vehicle registration plate GB.PNG\n| image2 = British vehicle registration plate EU.PNG\n| footer = After the UK withdraws from the EU, only registration plates featuring the [[Flag of the United Kingdom|Union Jack]] flag and the country code GB satisfies the [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]] as those registration plates display the [[international vehicle registration code]] for the country of registration (GB) incorporated into the vehicle registration plate, and is supplemented with a flag or emblem of the national state. \n<br>\nUntil the UK withdraws from the EU, the EU format is also valid within countries party to the Vienna Convention of Road Traffic as it displays the country code supplemented with the symbol of the regional economic integration organisation ([[Flag of the European Union|EU stars]]) the country belongs.

The Act was passed in order that vehicles could be easily traced in the event of an accident, contravention of the law or any other incident. Vehicle registration alphanumeric plates in the UK are rectangular or square in shape, with the exact permitted dimensions of the plate and its lettering set down in law. Front plates are white, whereas rear plates are yellow.\n\nWithin the UK itself, there are two systems: one for [[Great Britain]], which dates from 2001, and another for [[Northern Ireland]], which is similar to the original 1904 system. Both systems are administered by the [[Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency]] (DVLA) in [[Swansea]]. Until July 2014, Northern Ireland's system was administered by the [[Driver and Vehicle Agency]] (DVA) in [[Coleraine]], which had the same status as the DVLA. Other schemes relating to the UK are also listed below.

However, a vehicle is permitted to display a number plate where the age identifier is older (but ''not'' newer) than the vehicle. The wide awareness of how the \"age identifier\" works has led to it being used in advertising by used-car showrooms instead of simply stating a year.\n* In the case of a police investigation of an accident or vehicle-related crime, witnesses usually remember the initial area code letters \u2013 it is then quite simple to narrow down suspect vehicles to a much smaller number by checking the authority's database without having to know the full number.<ref>{{citation |url = http://www.speedyreg.co.uk/platehistory |title = History of Number Plates |publisher = Speedy Registrations Co.

The standard design have also incorporated a blue strip on the left side of the plate with the [[Flag of Europe|European Union symbol]] and the [[international vehicle registration code]] of the member state, although this aspect of the design is not compulsory. EU member states that require foreign vehicles to display a distinguishing sign of the country of origin (e.g. 'GB' for the United Kingdom) are obliged by Article 3 of EU Regulation No. 2411/98 to accept this standard design as a distinguishing sign when displayed on a vehicle registered in another member state, making a separate sign unnecessary for vehicles registered in the EU. After the UK ratified the [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]] in 2018, \"Europlates\" should also be valid in other countries party to that convention. \n\nAfter [[Brexit]], and the UK is no longer a member state of the European Union, other EU countries are no longer required to accept UK \"Europlates\", as the regulation only requires member states to accept the standard design as a distinguishing sign when displayed on a vehicle registered in another member state. However, the UK is currently in a so-called transition period until at least 31 December 2020 during which it is treated as an EU country. After this, Euro-plates must be replaced by a number plate that features the GB sign without the EU flag in order to be valid as a national identifier.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://inews.co.uk/inews-lifestyle/cars/driving-in-europe-after-brexit-how-leaving-the-eu-will-affect-uk-driving-licences-explained-1373249|title=Driving in Europe after Brexit: how leaving the EU will affect driving licences|website=inews.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2020-02-03}}</ref> \n\nCountries party to the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic are not bound to accept the EU design after the UK withdrew from the EU, because the \"Europlates\" will no longer show \"the emblem of the regional economic integration organisation the country belongs\" as described in the Convention after this. \n\n{{Clear}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:90%;\"\n|-\n!width=25%|[[File:British vehicle registration plate EU.PNG|200px]]\n!width=25%|[[File:United Kingdom motorcycle license plate GB LL51 JMB.png|100px]]\n!width=25%|[[File:United Kingdom license plate GB YK02 OML.jpg|200px]]\n|-\n|<center>''The British version of the EU standard number plate; this European plate is optional for UK vehicles.''</center>\n|<center>''This format is used for motorcycles and other vehicles where a narrower plate is required (showing optional EU symbol).''</center>\n|<center>''A British, [[Leeds]]\u2013registered number plate without the EU symbol; UK vehicles must display a separate GB sticker if used outside the UK with plates without the EU symbol.''</center>\n|}\n\n===== National emblems =====\nOwners of vehicles registered in Great Britain which are not already displaying the EU format \"GB\" plate may choose to display plates with one of the national emblems below plus lettering.

However, after the UK ratified the [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]] in 2018, number plates with the distinguishing code \"GB\" featuring the [[Union Jack]] (flag of the UK) should be valid in other countries party to named convention, as such number plate displays a distinguishing code for the country of registration incorporated into the vehicle registration plate, and is supplemented with a flag or emblem of the national state, and hence satisfies the requirements set out in the convention.<ref>https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/conventn/Conv_road_traffic_EN.pdf</ref> \n\nThe European Commission has confirmed that after Brexit, British cars with number plates with the distinguishing sign incorporated do not need a separate sign when driving in EU countries party to the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic. If the number plate does not include the distinguishing sign, or if the vehicle is driven in an EU country not party to the Vienna Convention, a separate sign has to be displayed at the rear of the vehicle.

The width of the previous font was condensed from 57&nbsp;mm to 50&nbsp;mm to allow space for the extra letter and the optional blue EU strip. The letter '''O''' and the digit '''0''' are intentionally identical, as are the letter '''I''' and digit '''1'''. But the typeface accentuates the differences between characters such as '''8''' and '''B''', or '''D''' and '''0''', with [[slab serif]]s to improve the legibility of a plate from a distance. This is especially useful for the [[automatic number plate recognition]] software of [[speed cameras]] and [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]]. This accentuation also discourages the tampering that is sometimes practised with the use of black [[insulating tape]] or paint to change letter forms (such as '''P''' to '''R''', or '''9''' to '''8'''), or with the inclusion of carefully positioned black \"fixing screw\" dots that alter the appearance of letters on some [[vanity plate]]s.\n\nThe design has similarities with the [[FE-Schrift]] number-plate font which was introduced in Germany in 1994 and which has been mandatory there since 2000. However, the UK design remains more conventional in its character shapes.\n\n==== Special plates ====\nRegistrations having a combination of characters that are particularly appealing (resembling a name, for example) are auctioned each year.

London and [[Middlesex]] quickly took most codes with L and M as the first letter respectively, while [[Surrey]], initially allocated <code>P</code>, took many codes beginning with that letter.\n\nThe first mark to be issued in London was the simple, bold, <code>A 1</code> and this was registered to [[Frank Russell, 2nd Earl Russell|Earl Russell]].

This scheme placed a serial letter before the code, and had the sequence number run only to 999, thus restricting the number of characters in a registration to six. The first area to issue such marks was [[Staffordshire]] in July 1932 with <code>ARF&nbsp;1</code> etc.,<ref name=\"regnumbers\">{{cite web |url = http://www.fleetdata.co.uk/ukregistrations.html |title = British vehicle registration numbers |publisher = Fleetdata.co.uk |accessdate = 29 December 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100219132653/http://fleetdata.co.uk/ukregistrations.html |archivedate = 19 February 2010 }}</ref> and all other areas in England and Wales, plus most areas in Scotland, followed suit once they had issued all their two-letter registrations.\n\nI, Q, and Z were not used as serial letters, as the use of I and Z continued to be restricted to Ireland and Q was reserved for temporary imports, while the single-letter codes were left out of this scheme as a serial letter would have created a duplicate of an existing two-letter code. (The [[Vehicle registration plates of Ireland#History|Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]] later adopted this scheme in their own ways, and the latter still uses it.)\n\nIn some areas, the available marks within this scheme started to run out in the 1950s, and in those areas, what became known as \"reversed\" registrations \u2013 the letters coming after the numbers \u2013 were introduced. Staffordshire was again the first area to issue such registrations, starting with <code>1000&nbsp;E</code> in 1953. In most cases, the three-letter combinations (e.g. <code>1&nbsp;AHX</code> for [[Middlesex]]) would be issued first, while in later years some areas started with the one- and two-letter combinations and others issued all three at the same time. The ever-increasing popularity of the car meant that by the beginning of the 1960s, these registrations were also running out.\n\nSome three-letter combinations were not authorised for licensing use as they were deemed offensive. These included <code>ARS</code>, <code>BUM</code>, <code>GOD</code>, <code>JEW</code>, <code>SEX</code>, and <code>SOD</code>.<ref>http://www.fergusontractor.co.uk/infofiles/which/regmk.asp  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921180228/http://www.fergusontractor.co.uk/infofiles/which/regmk.asp |date=21 September 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url = http://www.templeoftriumph.org/tsoa/TSOAJan72.pdf |first = Graham W. |last = Whitehead |title = Triumph Sells Record Number of Sportscars |journal = Triumph Sports Owners Association |volume = 18 |issue = 1, January 1972 |accessdate = 30 January 2015 }}</ref> <code>DUW</code> was issued in London for several months in 1934 before it was realised it was the Welsh for God, and withdrawn.<ref name=\"Newall\" />\nEven then, there were some registrations which would now be called cherished plates. One was RAD10 (BBC) and another was IND1A (Indian high commission).\n\n==== 1963 to 1982 ====\nIn August 1962, an attempt was made to create a national scheme to alleviate the problem of registrations running out. This used the scheme introduced in 1932, of a three-letter combination followed by a sequence number from 1 to 999, but also added a letter suffix, which initially changed on 1 January each year. An \"A\" suffix was thus used for 1963, \"B\" for 1964, etc. Middlesex was the first authority to adopt this scheme when it issued <code>AHX&nbsp;1A</code> in February 1963.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~pattle/nacc/arc0607.htm |title = UK registration marks from 1904 to August 2001 |publisher = The Moped Archive |accessdate = 29 December 2010 }}</ref> Most other areas followed suit during 1964, but some chose to stick to their own schemes up until 1 January 1965, when the letter suffix was made compulsory.\n\nAs well as yielding many more available numbers, it was a handy way for vehicle buyers to know the age of the vehicle immediately. However, the year letter changing on 1 January each year meant that car retailers soon started to notice that buyers would tend to wait until the New Year for the new letter to be issued, so that they could get a \"newer\" car. This led to major peaks and troughs in sales over the year, and to help flatten this out somewhat the industry lobbied to get the scheme changed, so that the change of year letter occurred on 1 August rather than 1 January. This was done in 1967, when \"E\" suffixes ran only from 1 January to 31 July, before \"F\" suffixes commenced on 1 August.\n\nAt the beginning, plates were black with white or silver characters. Reflective plates were introduced in 1969 and were white on the front and yellow on the rear with black characters.\n\nIn October 1974, responsibility for issuing registrations was transferred from local and regional authorities to specialist Local Vehicle Licensing Offices (LVLOs) or Vehicle Registration Offices (VROs) run by the DVLA. Most of the two-letter area codes allocated during the first scheme continued in their respective areas, albeit now indicating the nearest LVLO/VRO rather than the local or regional authority. However, the decision to streamline the allocations of these codes meant that some were transferred to new areas. For instance, the former [[Suffolk]] code <code>CF</code> was transferred to [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], while the former [[Edinburgh]] code <code>WS</code> was re-allocated to [[Bristol]].<ref name=\"regnumbers\" />\n\n==== 1983 to 2001 ====\nBy 1982, the year suffixes had reached Y and so from 1983 onwards the sequence was reversed again, so that the year letter \u2013 starting again at \"A\" \u2014 preceded the numbers then the letters of the registration. The available range was then <code>A21&nbsp;AAA</code> to <code>Y999&nbsp;YYY</code>, the numbers 1\u201320 being held back for the government's proposed, and later implemented, DVLA select registration sales scheme.\nTowards the mid-1990s there was some discussion about introducing a unified scheme for Europe, which would also incorporate the country code of origin of the vehicle, but after much debate such a scheme was not adopted because of lack of countries willing to participate.\n[[File:Q-plate on construction vehicle.jpg|thumb|180px|A construction vehicle bearing a Q number plate, August 2016, UK]]\nThe changes in 1983 also brought the letter Q into use \u2013 although on a very small and limited scale. It was used on vehicles of indeterminate age, such as those assembled from kits, substantial rebuilds, or imported vehicles where the documentation is insufficient to determine the age. There was a marked increase in the use of Q registrations in the late 1980s and early 1990s, fuelled by car crime.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Many stolen vehicles had false identities given to them, and when this was discovered and the original identity could not be determined, a Q registration would be issued to such vehicle. It was seen as an aid to consumer protection. Due to indeterminate age, origin and specification of Q registration vehicles, most motor insurers are reluctant to offer cover for these 'Q-plate' vehicles.\n\nBy the late 1990s, the range of available numbers was once again starting to run out, exacerbated by a move to biannual changes in registration letters (March and September) in 1999 to smooth out the bulge in registrations every August, so a new scheme needed to be adopted. It was decided to research a system that would be easier for [[traffic collision|crash]] or vehicle related crime witnesses to remember and clearer to read, yet still fit within a normal standard plate size.\n\n==== Year identifiers ====\nIn order to avoid any confusion, the letters I, O, Q, U and Z have never been issued as year identifiers: I because of its similarity to the numeral 1; O and Q because of similarity to a zero; U because of similarity to the letter V; and Z because of similarity to the numeral 2.\n\n{| style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n||'''Suffix letter series 1963\u201383'''||'''Prefix letter series 1983\u20132001'''\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\"|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Letter\n! scope=\"col\" | Dates of issue\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | A\n| February 1963<ref name=\"parkers-77\">{{citation |title = Parker's Car Price Guide |date = September 1977 }}</ref> \u2013 31 December 1963\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | B\n| 1 January 1964 \u2013 31 December 1964\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | C\n| 1 January 1965 \u2013 31 December 1965\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | D\n| 1 January 1966 \u2013 31 December 1966\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | E\n| 1 January 1967 \u2013 31 July 1967\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | F\n| 1 August 1967 \u2013 31 July 1968\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | G\n| 1 August 1968 \u2013 31 July 1969\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | H\n| 1 August 1969 \u2013 31 July 1970\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | J\n| 1 August 1970 \u2013 31 July 1971\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | K\n| 1 August 1971 \u2013 31 July 1972\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | L\n| 1 August 1972 \u2013 31 July 1973\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | M\n| 1 August 1973 \u2013 31 July 1974\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | N\n| 1 August 1974 \u2013 31 July 1975\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | P\n| 1 August 1975 \u2013 31 July 1976\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | R\n| 1 August 1976 \u2013 31 July 1977\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | S\n| 1 August 1977 \u2013 31 July 1978\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | T\n| 1 August 1978 \u2013 31 July 1979\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | V\n| 1 August 1979 \u2013 31 July 1980\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | W\n| 1 August 1980 \u2013 31 July 1981\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | X\n| 1 August 1981 \u2013 31 July 1982\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Y\n| 1 August 1982 \u2013 31 July 1983\n|}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\"|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Letter\n! scope=\"col\" | Dates of issue\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | A\n| 1 August 1983 \u2013 31 July 1984\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | B\n| 1 August 1984 \u2013 31 July 1985\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | C\n| 1 August 1985 \u2013 31 July 1986\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | D\n| 1 August 1986 \u2013 31 July 1987\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | E\n| 1 August 1987 \u2013 31 July 1988\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | F\n| 1 August 1988 \u2013 31 July 1989\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | G\n| 1 August 1989 \u2013 31 July 1990\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | H\n| 1 August 1990 \u2013 31 July 1991\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | J\n| 1 August 1991 \u2013 31 July 1992\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | K\n| 1 August 1992 \u2013 31 July 1993\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | L\n| 1 August 1993 \u2013 31 July 1994\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | M\n| 1 August 1994 \u2013 31 July 1995\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | N\n| 1 August 1995 \u2013 31 July 1996\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | P\n| 1 August 1996 \u2013 31 July 1997\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | R\n| 1 August 1997 \u2013 31 July 1998\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | S\n| 1 August 1998 \u2013 28 February 1999\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | T\n| 1 March 1999 \u2013 31 August 1999\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | V\n| 1 September 1999 \u2013 29 February 2000\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | W\n| 1 March 2000 \u2013 31 August 2000\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | X\n| 1 September 2000 \u2013 28 February 2001\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Y\n| 1 March 2001 \u2013 31 August 2001\n|}\n|}\n\n==== Pre-2001 codes ====\n\nNormally the last two letters would indicate where the car was initially registered.

EU bands are not provided, and are uncommon in Northern Ireland, but can be added, although the \"NI\" code is unofficial. This particular plate uses an old-style font.]]\n\nNorthern Ireland uses a modified version of the national system initiated for the whole of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] in 1903, with two-letter county and city codes featuring the letters I or Z representing [[Ireland]]. \n\nAs in Great Britain, each code originally ran from 1 to 9999, and when one was completed, another was allocated. All possible codes had been allocated by 1957, following which reversed sequences were introduced, the first county to do so being [[County Antrim|Antrim]] in January 1958 with <code>1&nbsp;IA</code>. These reversed sequences were completed quickly, leading to the introduction of the current \"<code>AXX&nbsp;1234</code>\" format in January 1966, where \"<code>XX</code>\" is the county code and \"<code>A</code>\" is a serial letter. This format allowed capacity to be increased. Each county adopted it once they had completed their reversed sequences, the last one to do so being [[County Londonderry]] in October 1973 with <code>AIW&nbsp;1</code>. From November 1985, the first 100 numbers of each series were withheld for use as cherished registrations. From April 1989, the numbers 101-999 were also withheld in this way. Even multiples of 1000 and 1111 (\"four-of-a-kind\") are deemed cherished by the DVLA and thus withheld. Each series ends at 9998 and follows on to the next letter/number combination in the series. \n\nWhen the [[Administrative counties of Ireland|administrative counties of Northern Ireland]] were dissolved in 1972, the responsibility for issuing registrations was transferred to the [[Minister of Home Affairs (Northern Ireland)|NI Ministry of Home Affairs]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisro/1973/337/contents/made|title=The Vehicles Excise (Transfer of Functions) (Supplementary Provisions) Order (Northern Ireland) 1973|work=[[Legislation.gov.uk]]|accessdate=4 May 2018}}</ref> and later the [[Department of the Environment (Northern Ireland)|Department of the Environment NI]]. From 21 July 2014, vehicle registration in Northern Ireland became the responsibility of the DVLA in Swansea. The pre-1972 format of Northern Ireland registration plates continues unchanged.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/vehicle-registration-from-21-july-2014 |title = Vehicle registration from 21 July 2014 |publisher = nidirect |accessdate = 15 August 2014 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140916004242/http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/vehicle-registration-from-21-july-2014 |archive-date = 16 September 2014 |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n== Most expensive plates ==\nAs popularity grows, the prices reached for the most expensive plates have increased with many motorists attracted by the investment potential as well as vanity. In the UK, sales of private plates via the Driver & Vehicle Licensing Agency exceeded \u00a3100&nbsp;million per annum for the first time in 2016. Since 1989 the DVLA has made a total of \u00a32&nbsp;billion from selling private plates. While the wealthy may spend more on a private plate than on their personal vehicle, not all car owners are attracted to private plates. This has not affected number plates from appreciating thousands in value each year.\n\nRegistration <code>1</code> sold for \u00a37.25&nbsp;million and is the highest price paid for a plate \u2013 in the [[United Arab Emirates]].

Other popular plates include BO55 EGO. It has previously gone on auction in 2016 where the owner rejected the highest asking of \u00a3127,000.\n\nThe popularity of race-related plates led the [[Driver & Vehicle Licensing Agency]] to make a motor racing game to mark the profits it has made from the sales of private plates. The celebration took place at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in 2010.<ref name=\"racergame\">{{cite web |url = http://dvlaregistrations.direct.gov.uk/goodwood2010/ |title = dvla's good wood soapbox reader game |author = dvlaregistrations |date = 2010}}</ref> On 25 January 2008 the registration <code>F1</code> sold for \u00a3440,000 to Bradford Car design [[entrepreneur]] Afzal Kahn.

Guidance document: INF267 (4/18) has been produced by the DVLA for accredited officials.\n\nThe distinguishing format is three numbers, space, letter D or X, space and three numbers. The letter D is predominately used for vehicles operated in or around the capital of London with the letter X allocated to vehicles outside London and for international organisations,{{fact|date=November 2018}} unless otherwise stated by bilateral treaty or arrangement. The first group of three numbers identifies the country or international organisation. The second group of three numbers is a serial number sequence starting at 101 for diplomats, 400 for non-diplomatic staff of international organisations, and 700 upwards for consular or other non-diplomatic staff. For example: 101 D 101 identifies the first registration allocated to the Afghanistan embassy and 900 X 400 is a registration allocated to the Commonwealth Secretariat. \n\n<center>\n{| border=\"1\"\n|- size=\"40\"  style=\"font-size:14pt; text-align:center; color:black;\"\n|  style=\"background:white; \"| 101 D 101\n|  style=\"background:yellow; \"| 101 D 101\n|-  style=\"font-size:14pt; text-align:center; color:black;\"\n|  style=\"background:white; \"| 900 X 400\n|  style=\"background:yellow; \"| 900 X 400\n|}\n</center>\n\nHonorary consuls are not entitled under UK law to diplomatic vehicle registrations and/or diplomatic driving permits.\n\nA limited number of \"flag\" registrations, bearing a similar format to earlier civilian registrations, have been issued to embassies and high commissions for use instead of a \"D\" or \"X\" registration on its vehicles. For example: United States' embassy is allowed to use the registration USA 1; Zimbabwe's embassy ZIM 1; Jamaica's high commission JAM 1 and South Korea's embassy ROK 1 \u2013 'Republic of Korea'. The North Korean embassy, however, had to buy a vanity plate: PRK 1D.{{fact|date=November 2018}}\n\nDiplomats are exempt from payment of vehicle tax (motor car road fund licence duty).\n\n=== Cherished marks (personal, vanity or private number plates) ===\nBy default, a UK registration plate will accompany a vehicle throughout the vehicle's lifetime. There is no requirement to re-register a vehicle when moving to a new part of the country and no requirement that the number be changed when ownership of the vehicle changes. It is, however, possible for another registration number to be transferred, replacing the one originally issued, where owners wish to have a \"[[vanity plate]]\" (sometimes referred to as a \"cherished\" registration) displaying, for instance, their initials. Registration numbers may also be replaced simply to disguise the actual age of the vehicle.\n\nAccording to information on the government DVLA website:\n\n\"Just remember you can make your vehicle look as old as you wish but you can not make it look newer than it is. For example you cannot put a Y registration number on a T registered vehicle but you could choose any prefix range from an A to a T. Each registration has an issue date which is what you must check to ensure you don't make your vehicle appear newer than it is.\"<ref>{{cite web |url = http://dvlaregistrations.direct.gov.uk/terms/terms-of-sale.html |title = Personalised Registrations: Terms & Conditions of Sale |publisher = [[Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency]] |accessdate = 30 January 2015 }}</ref> However, you are able to put 1955 registered private number plates on a 1949 registered vehicle as there is no year indicator to determine the age of release.\n\nAs many vehicles registered before 1963 have been scrapped, some of their \"dateless\" pre-1963 registration numbers have been transferred to other vehicles as personal plates. They can be valuable, and can also be used to conceal the age of an older vehicle. Many vintage and classic cars no longer bear their original index marks due to the owners being offered high premiums for the desirable registrations. In addition Northern Irish registrations are also regarded as \"dateless\" and are often transferred to vehicles outside Northern Ireland.<ref name=\"New Reg\">{{cite web |title = Northern Irish Registrations |url = http://www.newreg.co.uk/irish-number-plates/ |accessdate = 1 July 2014 }}</ref> Touring coaches often operate in other parts of the UK with registration numbers originally issued in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe DVLA's Personalised Registrations service also allows the purchase and transfer of registration numbers directly from the DVLA.<ref name=\"dvla-pr\">{{cite web |title = DVLA Personalised Registrations |url = http://dvlaregistrations.direct.gov.uk/ |work = [[Directgov]] |publisher = [[DVLA]] |accessdate = 10 September 2010 }}</ref> Many private dealers act as agents for DVLA issues (and sell DVLA numbers for more than the DVLA asking price, which many buyers do not realise), and also hold their own private stock of dateless registrations and other cherished marks. The DVLA however can only offer for sale registrations that have never previously been issued and thus have a limited offering and limited scope.\n\n=== State vehicles used by the reigning monarch ===\nMotor cars used by the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|reigning monarch]] on official business, which are ({{As of|2017|lc=on}}) all [[Rolls-Royce car|Rolls-Royces]] or [[Bentley]]s built to special specifications, do not carry number plates.<ref name=\"royalcars\"/> The monarch's private vehicles carry number plates.\n\n=== Other registration plates ===\n* Tax free export in 1970s had red borders around the plate.\n* United Kingdom American Exchange plates had the prefix \"UKAX\".\n* Some Republic of Ireland number plates have been registered in various motor tax offices in the UK. These plates dated from 1903-1986 and {{huh?|text=the UK practice of non-reregistration was discontinued in 1990.|reason=Which combination of ROI-to-ROI, ROI-to-UK, and UK-to-UK reregistration was allowed before 1990 but disallowed afterwards? And by which jurisdiction was it allowed/disallowed?|date=April 2018}} For example, VIP 1 was originally registered to a Jaguar in Co. Kilkenny (IP) Ireland in 1971 but is now registered on a Rolls Royce Corniche owned by Chelsea Football Club owner [[Roman Abramovich]]. Some UK embassy vehicles have I or Z in their number plates e.g. CZE (Dublin) 1, PHI (Tipperary) 1, which have originated in the Irish system. Vehicles registered in Ireland under the new system (87 onwards) and which are exported to the UK must de-register their new Irish county (or in many cases, their Irish export ZZ 5 digit plate) with the DVLA who will issue them with a new UK number.\n\n== Fraudulent use ==\nCriminals sometimes use copies of number plates legitimately used on a vehicle of identical type and colour to the one used, known as \"cloning\", to avoid being identified.<ref>[http://www.nationalnumbers.co.uk/articles/man-jailed-for-using-fake-plates-on-stolen-cars-2570] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140117135341/http://www.nationalnumbers.co.uk/articles/man-jailed-for-using-fake-plates-on-stolen-cars-2570|date=17 January 2014}}</ref> A routine police computer check shows the plate matching the type of vehicle and does not appear suspicious.\n\nThe UK Government introduced on 1 August 2008 regulations requiring the production of personal identification and vehicle registration documents when having number plates made by a retailer.<ref name=\"directgovhowto\">{{cite web |url = http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Motoring/BuyingAndSellingAVehicle/PersonalisedRegAndNumberPlates/DG_4022573 |title = How to get a number plate made up |author = Directgov |accessdate = 28 September 2009 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081205022837/http://www.direct.gov.uk./en/Motoring/BuyingAndSellingAVehicle/PersonalisedRegAndNumberPlates/DG_4022573 |archive-date = 5 December 2008 |url-status = dead }}</ref> The organisation that makes the plate is required to display their name and postcode, usually in small print at bottom centre, to aid in tracing false plates and their purchaser.<ref name=\"v796\" /> This requirement was introduced in 2001 when the new character style and two-digit year identifier came into force, and applies to all registration plates made after that date regardless of the year of the vehicle.\n\n== Registration plate suppliers ==\nNumber plates were initially made by the motor vehicle's original supplier, and replacement plates meeting standards could be made by anybody. Some people had street address numbers made up to motor-vehicle standards for their houses. From 2001 plates sold in England and Wales had to be provided by a supplier on the DVLA's Register of Number Plate Suppliers (RNPS) as specified in British Standard BSAU145d. The supplier needs to confirm that the customer is the registered keeper or other authorised person and verify their identity.<ref name=\"directgovhowto\" /> The name and postcode of the supplier must be shown at the bottom of the plate.<ref name=\"v796\" /> Number plates in the UK are usually flat and made of plastic; embossed aluminium plates are available from some suppliers. These rules are generally described as onerous, particularly to company car drivers who do not hold any of the required paperwork themselves (such items usually being stored by a fleet manager or lease hire company).\n\nRegistered number plate suppliers must keep records including the documents produced by their customers; they can be required to be shown to the police, although in reality this has seldom happened. The [[Department for Transport]] holds a full list of suppliers.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.gov.uk/number-plate-supplier |title = Find your nearest number plate supplier |work = gov.uk |year = 2015 |accessdate = 30 January 2015 }}</ref>\n\nSome companies, particularly those based online, sell number plates described as \"show plates\" or \"not for road use\", which may not satisfy the requirements of BSAU145d. However, if so specified, these products can be identical to number plates sold by approved RNPS registered supplier. Many of these companies do not ask customers to prove ownership of the registration they are purchasing, and try to circumvent the law by placing disclaimers on their websites. Despite these disclaimers, it is still not legal to produce any registration plates without seeing proof of identity of the purchaser (such as a driving licence), and proof of their connection to the registration (such as a V5C or retention certificate).<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.plate-trader.com/documents_required.php |title = Documents required from registered number plate suppliers |publisher = Plate-Trader.com |accessdate = 6 May 2014 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Vehicle registration plate]]\n* [[Vehicle registration plates of the European Union]]\n* [[Vehicle registration plates of the Isle of Man]]\n* [[Vehicle registration plates of the Channel Islands]]\n* [[Vehicle registration plates of British overseas territories]]\n* [[Vehicle Excise Duty]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|License plates of the United Kingdom}}\n\n{{Vehicle registration plates of Europe}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vehicle Registration Plates of the United Kingdom}}\n[[Category:Vehicle registration plates of the United Kingdom| ]]\n[[Category:Road transport in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Vehicle registration plates by country|United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:United Kingdom transport-related lists]]\n", "name_user": "86.181.247.97", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eMost expensive plates)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_registration_plates_of_the_United_Kingdom"}

His old friend of Garpar road, Pulak Ghoshal ([[Paran Bandyopadhyay]]), is the director. Feluda and [[Topshe]] accompany him.\n\nOne day prior to the journey, a mysterious film producer named Sanyal visits Jatayu and conveys that he intends to make a film on the same novel on which Pulok Ghoshal is making a film. Jatayu tells him that the novel is sold, and thus Sanyal leaves. However, Sanyal requests him to handle a packet to one of his allies at the [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport|Mumbai airport]], to which Jatayu agrees.\n\nOnce in Mumbai, a man comes to pick up the parcel ([[Rajatava Dutta]]), and by mistake, Jatayu gives him another parcel, which contained a copy of his novel. The man goes to a multistory building and gets attacked in the elevator by another man. He kills the assassin, and drops a piece of paper near the body. Feluda and team check in a hotel, where they are told by Pulak about the murder, and the trio meet inspector Patwardhan ([[Anjan Srivastav]]).\n\nInspector Patwardhan tells them that a necklace of [[Nana Sahib]] has been stolen from [[Nepal]] and that it may be smuggled in [[India]] by unknown smugglers. Next day at the beach, Feluda finds out through a newspaper clipping that the piece of paper contained Jatayu's description. The trio next meet the producer of the film Mr. Gorey ([[Ashish Vidyarthi]]). Pulak Ghoshal the director further introduces them to Victor Perumal ([[Rajesh Sharma (actor)|Rajesh Sharma]]), a martial artist from [[Japan]], who is the stunt coordinator for the film.\n\nThings turn mysterious when the trio get attacked multiple times by unknown men, forcing Feluda to open the brown packet of Sanyal after realizing Jatayu's parcel swap. He finds [[The Life Divine]] of [[Aurobindo Ghosh]] book inside, which makes him more puzzled. Further, it is revealed that in the novel, Jatayu mentioned a fictional building called the Shivaji Castle, which is the residence of the villain of his novel, but finds out that the building is there for real, and is the residence of Mr Gorey.\n\nAt the day of shoot, the trio board a train where an action sequence is being shot, and Sanyal shows up. Along with the mysterious man brandishing a gun, Sanyal asks Feluda to hand him the book, which he gladly does, but finds something missing there. It is now revealed that Nana Sahib's necklace was inside the book, and Sanyal is the kingpin of a smuggling mafia operating in [[Mumbai]]. Quite unexpectedly, Victor Perumal jumps down in the compartment causing the mysterious man to lose balance and let go of his revolver. Sanyal is overpowered, and Feluda shoots Nimmo in the leg who tries to escape. It is now revealed that Sanyal is actually Gorey in makeup, and he is a real time smuggler who tried to smuggle the necklace with Jatayu's help. His men attacked them in order to get the parcel, and that Victor was instructed by Feluda to jump in their compartment if he sensed danger.\n\nEverything ends well with Gorey being arrested and Pulok cheering Jatayu that the shooting will be resumed soon with a new producer on board.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sabyasachi Chakrabarty]] as [[Feluda]]\n* [[Parambrata Chatterjee]] as Topshe\n* [[Bibhu Bhattacharya]] as [[Jatayu]]\n* [[Paran Bandyopadhyay]] As Pulok Ghoshal\n* [[Ashish Vidyarthi]] as Gopinath Gorey/Sanyal\n* [[Rajatava Dutta]] as Nimmo\n* [[Rajesh Sharma (actor)|Rajesh Sharma]] as Victor Perumal\n* [[Joy Badlani]]\n* [[Anjan Srivastav]] as CID Inspector Patwardhan\n* Mohan Seth\n* Shome Mukherjee as Miki\n\n==Reception==\nAlthough the movie was a box office success, the movie was criticised for its making style.

However, Sanyal requests him to handle a packet to one of his allies at the Mumbai airport, to which Jatayu agrees.\n\nOnce in Mumbai, a man comes to pick up the parcel ([[Rajatava Dutta]]), and by mistake, Jatayu gives him another parcel, which contained a copy of his novel. The man goes to a multistory building and gets attacked in the elevator by another man. He kills the assassin, and drops a piece of paper near the body. Feluda and team check in a hotel, where they are told by Pulak about the murder, and the trio meet inspector Patwardhan ([[Anjan Srivastav]]).\n\nInspector Patwardhan tells them that a necklace of [[Nana Sahib]] has been stolen from [[Nepal]] and that it may be smuggled in [[India]] by unknown smugglers. Next day at the beach, Feluda finds out through a newspaper clipping that the piece of paper contained Jatayu's description. The trio next meet the producer of the film Mr. Gorey ([[Ashish Vidyarthi]]). Pulak Ghoshal the director further introduces them to Victor Perumal ([[Rajesh Sharma (actor)|Rajesh Sharma]]), a martial artist from [[Japan]], who is the stunt coordinator for the film.\n\nThings turn mysterious when the trio get attacked multiple times by unknown men, forcing Feluda to open the brown packet of Sanyal after realizing Jatayu's parcel swap. He finds [[The Life Divine]] of [[Aurobindo Ghosh]] book inside, which makes him more puzzled. Further, it is revealed that in the novel, Jatayu mentioned a fictional building called the Shivaji Castle, which is the residence of the villain of his novel, but finds out that the building is there for real, and is the residence of Mr Gorey.\n\nAt the day of shoot, the trio board a train where an action sequence is being shot, and Sanyal shows up. Along with the mysterious man brandishing a gun, Sanyal asks Feluda to hand him the book, which he gladly does, but finds something missing there. It is now revealed that Nana Sahib's necklace was inside the book, and Sanyal is the kingpin of a smuggling mafia operating in [[Mumbai]]. Quite unexpectedly, Victor Perumal jumps down in the compartment causing the mysterious man to lose balance and let go of his revolver. Sanyal is overpowered, and Feluda shoots Nimmo in the leg who tries to escape. It is now revealed that Sanyal is actually Gorey in makeup, and he is a real time smuggler who tried to smuggle the necklace with Jatayu's help. His men attacked them in order to get the parcel, and that Victor was instructed by Feluda to jump in their compartment if he sensed danger.\n\nEverything ends well with Gorey being arrested and Pulok cheering Jatayu that the shooting will be resumed soon with a new producer on board.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sabyasachi Chakrabarty]] as [[Feluda]]\n* [[Parambrata Chatterjee]] as Topshe\n* [[Bibhu Bhattacharya]] as [[Jatayu]]\n* [[Paran Bandyopadhyay]] As Pulok Ghoshal\n* [[Ashish Vidyarthi]] as Gopinath Gorey/Sanyal\n* [[Rajatava Dutta]] as Nimmo\n* [[Rajesh Sharma (actor)|Rajesh Sharma]] as Victor Perumal\n* [[Joy Badlani]]\n* [[Anjan Srivastav]] as CID Inspector Patwardhan\n* Mohan Seth\n* Shome Mukherjee as Miki\n\n==Reception==\nAlthough the movie was a box office success, the movie was criticised for its making style.

With a length (from the top of its head to the tip of its long pointed tail) of about one meter (3.3&nbsp;ft) it is longer than any other species of parrot. It is the largest [[macaw]] and the largest flying parrot species, though the flightless [[kakapo]] of New Zealand can outweigh it at up to 3.5&nbsp;kg. While generally easily recognized, it could be confused with the smaller [[Lear's macaw]]. Habitat loss and the trapping of wild birds for the pet trade have taken a heavy toll on their population in the wild, so the species is classified as [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]] on the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]]'s [[IUCN Red List|Red List]],<ref name=IUCN /> and it is protected by its listing on Appendix I of the [[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora]] (CITES).\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nEnglish physician, ornithologist, and artist [[John Latham (ornithologist)|John Latham]] first described the hyacinth macaw in 1790 under the [[binomial name]] ''Psittacus hyacinthinus'' based on a taxidermic specimen sent to England.<ref>{{cite book| last= Latham| first= John | year=1790 | title= Index Ornithologicus, Sive Systema Ornithologiae: Complectens Avium Divisionem in Classes, Ordines, Genera, Species, Ipsarumque Varietates (Volume 1) | language=Latin | place=London | publisher = Leigh & Sotheby | page=84 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QV5UAAAAcAAJ&pg=PT107}}</ref> It is one of two extant and one probably extinct species of the South American macaw genus ''[[Anodorhynchus]]''.\nDid you know that aliens exist.\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Hyacinth Macaw head.jpg|205px|thumb|left|Close-up of head]]\n[[File:Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus ZOO Dvur Kralove.jpg|right|thumb|205px|A skeleton exhibited at [[Dv\u016fr Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 Zoo]] in [[Dv\u016fr Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 nad Labem]], Czech Republic]]\nThe largest parrot by length in the world, the hyacinth macaw is {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} long from the tip of its tail to the top of its head and weighs {{convert|1.2|\u2013|1.7|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Forshaw (2006). plate 70.\">Forshaw (2006). plate 70.</ref><ref name=\"animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu\">Hagan, E.

Reported sightings of tool use in wild parrots go as far back as 1863. Examples of tool use that have been observed usually involve a chewed leaf or pieces of wood. Macaws often incorporate these items when feeding on harder nuts. Their use allows the nuts the macaws eat to remain in position (prevent slipping) while they gnaw into it. It is not known whether this is learned social behavior or an innate trait, but observation on captive macaws shows that hand-raised macaws exhibit this behavior, as well. Comparisons show that older macaws were able to open seeds more efficiently.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s10071-004-0221-3|pmid=15248094|title=Preliminary observations of tool use in captive hyacinth macaws (''Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus'')|journal=Animal Cognition|volume=8|issue=1|pages=48\u201352|year=2004|last1=Borsari|first1=Andressa|last2=Ottoni|first2=Eduardo B.}}</ref>\n\n=== Reproduction ===\n[[File:Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus -Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil -nest-8 (3).jpg|right|thumb|A pair in their nest]]\nNesting takes place between July and December, with nests constructed in tree cavities or cliff faces depending on the habitat.<ref name=\"Birdlife\" /> In the Pantanal region, 90% of nests are constructed in the manduvi tree (''[[Sterculia apetala]]'').

Survival rates could also be enhanced if ranch owners would leave all large and potential nest trees standing and eliminate all trapping on their properties.

With a length (from the top of its head to the tip of its long pointed tail) of about one meter (3.3&nbsp;ft) it is longer than any other species of parrot. It is the largest [[macaw]] and the largest flying parrot species, though the flightless [[kakapo]] of New Zealand can outweigh it at up to 3.5&nbsp;kg. While generally easily recognized, it could be confused with the smaller [[Lear's macaw]].

Reported sightings of tool use in wild parrots go as far back as 1863. Examples of tool use that have been observed usually involve a chewed leaf or pieces of wood. Macaws often incorporate these items when feeding on harder nuts. Their use allows the nuts the macaws eat to remain in position (prevent slipping) while they gnaw into it. It is not known whether this is learned social behavior or an innate trait, but observation on captive macaws shows that hand-raised macaws exhibit this behavior, as well. Comparisons show that older macaws were able to open seeds more efficiently.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s10071-004-0221-3|pmid=15248094|title=Preliminary observations of tool use in captive hyacinth macaws (''Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus'')|journal=Animal Cognition|volume=8|issue=1|pages=48\u201352|year=2004|last1=Borsari|first1=Andressa|last2=Ottoni|first2=Eduardo B.}}</ref>\n\n=== Reproduction ===\n[[File:Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus -Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil -nest-8 (3).jpg|right|thumb|A pair in their nest]]\nNesting takes place between July and December, with nests constructed in tree cavities or cliff faces depending on the habitat.<ref name=\"Birdlife\" /> In the Pantanal region, 90% of nests are constructed in the manduvi tree (''[[Sterculia apetala]]'').

Unfortunately, animal trafficking is not necessarily viewed as a priority in the city, leaving national departmental and municipal governments unwilling to halt the trade in city centers, and local police reluctant to get involved. This ideology has in turn resulted in a lack of enforcement regarding trade in both CITES-restricted species and threatened species, with little to no restrictions regarding humane treatment of the animals, disease control, or proper hygiene. In the trade centers, the hyacinth macaw demanded the highest price of US$1,000, proving it to be a very desirable and valued bird in the pet trade industry.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Mauricio, H.|author2=Hennessey, B.|last-author-amp=yes |title=Quantifying the illegal parrot trade in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia, with emphasis on threatened species|journal=Bird Conservation International|volume=17|issue=4|pages=295\u2013300|doi=10.1017/S0959270907000858 |year=2007|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n=== Conservation steps taken to preserve the hyacinth macaw ===\n\nIn 1989, the [[European Endangered Species Programme]] for the hyacinth macaw was founded as a result of concerns about the status of the wild population and the lack of successful breeding in captivity.<ref name=\"Luecker, H. 2000\" /> Breeding in captivity still remains difficult, being that hand-reared hyacinth macaw offspring have demonstrated to have higher mortality rates, especially within the first month of life. Additionally, they have a higher incidence of acute crop stasis than other macaw species due, in part, to their specific dietary requirements.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Casares, M.|author2=F.

Many ranch owners in the Pantanal and Gerais, to protect the birds, no longer allow trappers on their properties.<ref name=IUCN />\n\nA number of conservation actions have been proposed, including the study of the current range, population status, and extent of trading in different parts of its range. Additionally, propositions have been made to assess the effectiveness of artificial nest boxes, enforce legal measures preventing trade, and experiment with ecotourism at one or two sites to encourage donors.<ref name=IUCN /> Furthermore, the Hyacinth Macaw Project in Mato Grosso do Sul has carried out important research by ringing individual birds and has created a number of artificial nests to compensate for the small number of sites available in the region.<ref name=\"Hyacinth Macaw 2013\" /> Furthermore, proposals to list the species as Endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act have been made to further protective measures in the US and to create Bolivian and Paraguayan trade management authorities under presidential control.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n=== Long-term prospects ===\nEach of the three main populations should be managed as a separate biological entity so as to avoid numbers dropping below 500. While the birds may be in decline in the wild, notably higher populations of captive macaws are being held in zoos and private collections. If success in managing and replanting the macaw's food trees and erecting nest boxes as an experiment in the Pantanals is seen, the species could survive. Survival rates could also be enhanced if ranch owners would leave all large and potential nest trees standing and eliminate all trapping on their properties. Ultimately, should these factors work in tandem with erection of nest boxes, fencing off of certain saplings, and the planting of others, the long-term prospects of the hyacinth macaw species would be greatly improved.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"130px\">\nHyacinth macaws (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus) 2.jpg\nHyacinth macaw (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus) in flight.JPG\nFile:Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus -pet parrot-8a.jpg|Pet hyacinth macaw on arm\nFile:Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus -pet on bike handlebars-8.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of macaws]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n* {{Cite book |first=Joseph M. |last=Forshaw |authorlink=Joseph Forshaw |title=Parrots of the World; an Identification Guide |others=Illustrated by [[Frank Knight (artist)|Frank Knight]] |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |isbn=978-0-691-09251-5 |nopp=yes |year=2006 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/parrotsofworldid0000fors }}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons|Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus}}\n{{Wikispecies|Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus}}\n* [http://ibc.lynxeds.com/species/hyacinth-macaw-anodorhynchus-hyacinthinus Hyacinth macaw] on the Internet Bird Collection\n* {{ARKive}}\n* [http://www.bluemacaws.org/ The Blue Macaws website]\n* [http://www.macaw-facts.com/species/blue-macaw-hyacinth-macaw-hyacinthine-macaw/ In-Depth Blue Macaw Research]\n* [http://www.freesound.org/samplesViewSingle.php?id=56513 Audio File of the hyacinth macaw]\n\n{{Macaws}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q463154}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:macaw, hyacinth}}\n[[Category:Anodorhynchus|hyacinth macaw]]\n[[Category:Macaws|hyacinth macaw]]\n[[Category:Talking birds]]\n[[Category:Birds of the Cerrado]]\n[[Category:Birds of the Pantanal]]\n[[Category:Birds of Brazil]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:Birds described in 1790|hyacinth macaw]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by John Latham (ornithologist)|hyacinth macaw]]\n[[Category:Species endangered by habitat loss]]\n[[Category:Species endangered by the pet trade]]\n", "name_user": "2a00:23c7:3a80:e700:a1fa:de43:edfb:1215", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eTaxonomy)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyacinth_macaw"}
