According to one version of events, dating from pre-[[History of rugby league#Professional rugby begins in Australia|schism]] days at the turn of the 20th century, some of the club's players earned some extra money on Saturday mornings as rabbit-oh men, staining their jerseys with rabbit blood in the process; when they played in those blood stained jumpers that afternoon, opponents from wealthier rugby clubs did not always appreciate the aroma and would mockingly repeat the \"Rabbitoh!\" cry.<ref>See the comments of ABC radio reporter Joe O'Brien from the transcript of the ABC ''PM'' radio program [http://www.abc.net.au/pm/stories/s324987.htm \"Rabbitohs continue historic form\"], broadcast on Friday, 6 July 2001.</ref> Another version was that the term was a disparaging reference by opposing teams to South's home ground being plagued with \"rabbit 'oles\"; in those early days [[Redfern Oval]] was then known as Nathan's Cow Paddock.<ref name=\"rl1908\"/> A third version claims the Rabbitoh name was adopted from that of the touring [[Australia national rugby union team|Australian rugby union]] teams of the early 1900s who were nicknamed \"Rabbits\" prior to discarding the name in 1908 in favour of the moniker \"Wallabies\".<ref name=\"New Speculations\">[http://www.rl1908.com/clubcomps/origins.htm \"Club Histories \u2013 New Speculations\"] ''RL1908.com'' by Sean Fagan. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061021080342/http://www.rl1908.com/clubcomps/origins.htm |date=21 October 2006 }}</ref>\n\nThe \"Rabbitoh\" emblem, a running white rabbit, first appeared on the team's jersey in [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1959|1959]]. The Rabbitoh emblem has in various forms been carried as the club's crest on every player's jersey ever since. The original \"Rabbitoh\" emblem design that appeared on the team's jerseys throughout the 1960s and 1970s has now been incorporated on the current jersey.\n\nThe South Sydney Rabbitohs celebrated their centenary year during 2008. The club released a centenary emblem to commemorate the occasion. To also coincide with the centenary year, Souths opted to alter their logo by removing the red and green oval from their emblem for a solid white rabbit with the words ''South Sydney Rabbitohs'' set in uppercase type.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Colours==\nSouth Sydney has used [[cardinal red]] and myrtle green colours on its playing jerseys for the vast majority of the club's history. Prior to the establishment of the rugby league club in 1908, the South Sydney [[New South Wales Rugby Union|rugby union]] team originally wore a red and green hooped jersey. Some sources have suggested that this combination of colours was due to the local rugby union club being nicknamed the \"Redfern Waratahs\". The first British inhabitants had often called the [[waratah]] a \"red fern\" instead, hence giving the suburb its name, and ultimately the local rugby club its emblem. Red and green dominate the colours of the waratah and hence, possibly, the South Sydney Rugby League Football Club adopted these colours for their jerseys.<ref name=\"New Speculations\"/> However, the suburb of Redfern was named in honour of [[William Redfern]], one of the first doctors of the colony, who treated convicts and poor settlers as well as the wealthy.\n\nThe club's jersey has been a hooped-styled one comprising alternating red and green, and has been used for the vast majority of the club's history.<ref>[http://www.rabbitohs.com.au/Shop/memorabilia.html#Scene_1 South Sydney traditional jersey] from the official South Sydney website.</ref> In [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1945|1945]] and [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1946|1946]] the club broke with this tradition and used a green design with a red \"V\" around the collar, before reverting to the original hoop style. From [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1980|1980]] to [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1984|1984]] the team played in a strip which saw the inclusion of white hoops within a predominately green design with a central red stripe and was affectionately known as the \"Minties\"<ref>See the article ''Having a \"Mintie wrapper\" in your wardrobe'' by Mark Courtney in ''Souths The People's Team'', edited by Angus Fontaine, League Week, ACP Publishing, 2002.</ref> jersey (so-called due to its apparent similarity to the wrapper design of the popular sweet). With the introduction of \"away\" jerseys towards the end of the 20th century, the club initially introduced a predominantly white jersey for away matches which was changed to a predominantly black one for the [[National Rugby League season 2006|2006 season]].\n\nBefore the start of the [[National Rugby League season 2007|2007 season]], the club announced that the away jersey would be styled identically to the traditional home jersey, with the exception of sponsorship and the rabbit emblem, which has been styled similarly to the one that initially featured on jerseys in the 1960s.<ref>[http://www.rabbitohs.com.au/Shop/Mens-Apparel/Jerseys/2009-Home-Jersey.html#Scene_1 South Sydney 2009 home jersey] from the official South Sydney website.</ref> For season 2009, the rabbit emblem is black for home matches whilst the emblem is the original white for away matches.<ref>[http://www.rabbitohs.com.au/Shop/Mens-Apparel/Jerseys/2009-Away-Jersey-.html#Scene_1 South Sydney 2009 alternate (away) jersey] from the official South Sydney website.</ref>\n\nThe playing shorts worn were historically black, though in the late 1970s the club adopted green shorts with a red vertical stripe. This was then superseded by the white shorts of the \"Minties\" outfit. When the club subsequently reverted to their traditional playing strip, the decision was made to wear black shorts once more. In 2008 the Rabbitohs wore white shorts to match the white stripe running down the side of their jersey.\n\n==Geographic area==\nThe South Sydney District Rugby League Football Club (precursor to the current corporate entity) was formed, under the original 1908 articles of association with the NSWRL competition, to represent the Sydney municipalities of ''' Alexandria, Botany, Mascot, Randwick, Waterloo, and Zetland'''.\n\nSouths have a proud history of indigenous players from the local district clubs including [[La Perouse  United]], [[Redfern All Blacks]] and indigenous recruits from [[Country Rugby League|Country NSW]].\n\n==Stadium==\nDuring the early years of the [[New South Wales Rugby League premiership]], \"home games\" were not assigned very often. However, South Sydney played most of their games at the [[Royal Agricultural Society Ground]] (Sydney Showground) from 1908 until the club's departure in 1920. From 1911 onwards, the [[Sydney Sports Ground]] was also used interchangeably with the Agricultural Ground over a decade for hosting matches.<ref>[http://www.angelfire.com/nb/coop/zSOUTH_SYDNEY.htm South Sydney] Co-op.</ref> In 1947 the club played its final season at the Sports Ground, before relocating to [[Redfern Oval]] in 1948.<ref>[http://stats.rleague.com/rl/venues/redfern.html Redfern Oval] from the [http://stats.rleague.com/rl/rl_index.html Rugby League Tables & Statistics website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821095436/http://stats.rleague.com/rl/rl_index.html |date=21 August 2007 }}</ref> It was here that team played in the heart of the club's territory and played the vast majority of its allocated home matches.\n\n[[File:Panorama-TelstraStadium-Oct2005.jpg|thumb|[[Stadium Australia|ANZ Stadium]], the Rabbitohs current home ground.]]\nIn 1988, the club began to play in the [[Sydney Football Stadium]],<ref>[http://stats.rleague.com/rl/venues/s.f.s..html Sydney Football Stadium] from the [http://stats.rleague.com/rl/rl_index.html Rugby League Tables & Statistics website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821095436/http://stats.rleague.com/rl/rl_index.html |date=21 August 2007 }}</ref> just built upon the former Sydney Sports Ground and Sydney Cricket Ground No. 2 Oval.

The club is also informally referred to as the ''Rabbits'', ''Bunnies'' or ''Souths''.\n\nExactly how South Sydney came to be known as the Rabbitohs is unknown. According to one version of events, dating from pre-[[History of rugby league#Professional rugby begins in Australia|schism]] days at the turn of the 20th century, some of the club's players earned some extra money on Saturday mornings as rabbit-oh men, staining their jerseys with rabbit blood in the process; when they played in those blood stained jumpers that afternoon, opponents from wealthier rugby clubs did not always appreciate the aroma and would mockingly repeat the \"Rabbitoh!\" cry.<ref>See the comments of ABC radio reporter Joe O'Brien from the transcript of the ABC ''PM'' radio program [http://www.abc.net.au/pm/stories/s324987.htm \"Rabbitohs continue historic form\"], broadcast on Friday, 6 July 2001.</ref> Another version was that the term was a disparaging reference by opposing teams to South's home ground being plagued with \"rabbit 'oles\"; in those early days [[Redfern Oval]] was then known as Nathan's Cow Paddock.<ref name=\"rl1908\"/> A third version claims the Rabbitoh name was adopted from that of the touring [[Australia national rugby union team|Australian rugby union]] teams of the early 1900s who were nicknamed \"Rabbits\" prior to discarding the name in 1908 in favour of the moniker \"Wallabies\".<ref name=\"New Speculations\">[http://www.rl1908.com/clubcomps/origins.htm \"Club Histories \u2013 New Speculations\"] ''RL1908.com'' by Sean Fagan. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061021080342/http://www.rl1908.com/clubcomps/origins.htm |date=21 October 2006 }}</ref>\n\nThe \"Rabbitoh\" emblem, a running white rabbit, first appeared on the team's jersey in [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1959|1959]]. The Rabbitoh emblem has in various forms been carried as the club's crest on every player's jersey ever since. The original \"Rabbitoh\" emblem design that appeared on the team's jerseys throughout the 1960s and 1970s has now been incorporated on the current jersey.\n\nThe South Sydney Rabbitohs celebrated their centenary year during 2008. The club released a centenary emblem to commemorate the occasion. To also coincide with the centenary year, Souths opted to alter their logo by removing the red and green oval from their emblem for a solid white rabbit with the words ''South Sydney Rabbitohs'' set in uppercase type.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Colours==\nSouth Sydney has used [[cardinal red]] and myrtle green colours on its playing jerseys for the vast majority of the club's history. Prior to the establishment of the rugby league club in 1908, the South Sydney [[New South Wales Rugby Union|rugby union]] team originally wore a red and green hooped jersey. Some sources have suggested that this combination of colours was due to the local rugby union club being nicknamed the \"Redfern Waratahs\". The first British inhabitants had often called the [[waratah]] a \"red fern\" instead, hence giving the suburb its name, and ultimately the local rugby club its emblem. Red and green dominate the colours of the waratah and hence, possibly, the South Sydney Rugby League Football Club adopted these colours for their jerseys.<ref name=\"New Speculations\"/> However, the suburb of Redfern was named in honour of [[William Redfern]], one of the first doctors of the colony, who treated convicts and poor settlers as well as the wealthy.\n\nThe club's jersey has been a hooped-styled one comprising alternating red and green, and has been used for the vast majority of the club's history.<ref>[http://www.rabbitohs.com.au/Shop/memorabilia.html#Scene_1 South Sydney traditional jersey] from the official South Sydney website.</ref> In [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1945|1945]] and [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1946|1946]] the club broke with this tradition and used a green design with a red \"V\" around the collar, before reverting to the original hoop style. From [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1980|1980]] to [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1984|1984]] the team played in a strip which saw the inclusion of white hoops within a predominately green design with a central red stripe and was affectionately known as the \"Minties\"<ref>See the article ''Having a \"Mintie wrapper\" in your wardrobe'' by Mark Courtney in ''Souths The People's Team'', edited by Angus Fontaine, League Week, ACP Publishing, 2002.</ref> jersey (so-called due to its apparent similarity to the wrapper design of the popular sweet). With the introduction of \"away\" jerseys towards the end of the 20th century, the club initially introduced a predominantly white jersey for away matches which was changed to a predominantly black one for the [[National Rugby League season 2006|2006 season]].\n\nBefore the start of the [[National Rugby League season 2007|2007 season]], the club announced that the away jersey would be styled identically to the traditional home jersey, with the exception of sponsorship and the rabbit emblem, which has been styled similarly to the one that initially featured on jerseys in the 1960s.<ref>[http://www.rabbitohs.com.au/Shop/Mens-Apparel/Jerseys/2009-Home-Jersey.html#Scene_1 South Sydney 2009 home jersey] from the official South Sydney website.</ref> For season 2009, the rabbit emblem is black for home matches whilst the emblem is the original white for away matches.<ref>[http://www.rabbitohs.com.au/Shop/Mens-Apparel/Jerseys/2009-Away-Jersey-.html#Scene_1 South Sydney 2009 alternate (away) jersey] from the official South Sydney website.</ref>\n\nThe playing shorts worn were historically black, though in the late 1970s the club adopted green shorts with a red vertical stripe. This was then superseded by the white shorts of the \"Minties\" outfit. When the club subsequently reverted to their traditional playing strip, the decision was made to wear black shorts once more. In 2008 the Rabbitohs wore white shorts to match the white stripe running down the side of their jersey.\n\n==Geographic area==\nThe South Sydney District Rugby League Football Club (precursor to the current corporate entity) was formed, under the original 1908 articles of association with the NSWRL competition, to represent the Sydney municipalities of ''' Alexandria, Botany, Mascot, Randwick, Waterloo, and Zetland'''.\n\nSouths have a proud history of indigenous players from the local district clubs including [[La Perouse  United]], [[Redfern All Blacks]] and indigenous recruits from [[Country Rugby League|Country NSW]].\n\n==Stadium==\nDuring the early years of the [[New South Wales Rugby League premiership]], \"home games\" were not assigned very often. However, South Sydney played most of their games at the [[Royal Agricultural Society Ground]] (Sydney Showground) from 1908 until the club's departure in 1920. From 1911 onwards, the [[Sydney Sports Ground]] was also used interchangeably with the Agricultural Ground over a decade for hosting matches.<ref>[http://www.angelfire.com/nb/coop/zSOUTH_SYDNEY.htm South Sydney] Co-op.</ref> In 1947 the club played its final season at the Sports Ground, before relocating to [[Redfern Oval]] in 1948.<ref>[http://stats.rleague.com/rl/venues/redfern.html Redfern Oval] from the [http://stats.rleague.com/rl/rl_index.html Rugby League Tables & Statistics website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821095436/http://stats.rleague.com/rl/rl_index.html |date=21 August 2007 }}</ref> It was here that team played in the heart of the club's territory and played the vast majority of its allocated home matches.\n\n[[File:Panorama-TelstraStadium-Oct2005.jpg|thumb|[[Stadium Australia|ANZ Stadium]], the Rabbitohs current home ground.]]\nIn 1988, the club began to play in the [[Sydney Football Stadium]],<ref>[http://stats.rleague.com/rl/venues/s.f.s..html Sydney Football Stadium] from the [http://stats.rleague.com/rl/rl_index.html Rugby League Tables & Statistics website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821095436/http://stats.rleague.com/rl/rl_index.html |date=21 August 2007 }}</ref> just built upon the former Sydney Sports Ground and Sydney Cricket Ground No. 2 Oval.

On his deathbed, Ramarama names Tukaram, his second son his successor, prompting Jayaram, his eldest son to quickly usurp the throne from his brother. He claims that he will not take the throne until the treasure is returned, prompting a territory wide search.\n\nFifteen years later, and the treasure is still missing. Lakshmi ([[Shanvi Srivastava]]) is a local journalist covering Harishchandra, a treasure hunter. She witnesses Harishchandra's kidnapping, and goes to report it to Narayana ([[Rakshit Shetty]]), a police officer. Narayana haughtily assumes he had caught Harishchandra's kidnappers but they were Harishchandra's bodyguards. Later, by chance he finds out that the detective in the reporters van. It is revealed that the apart from Tukaram and Jayaram that Narayana is the one who got the detective kidnapped and is also behind the treasure.\n\nHe wittily escapes from  Jayaram's fort. Later he finds out that the tribe of the drama artists are still waiting for their last play in Amaravati and wouldn't leave until their 'Hari' comes and redeems them. The prophecy says that an eagle would sit on the 'Hari' and thus their rescuer would help them. One night when he is following the people from the drama troupe Narayana exchanges the costumes with the artists and the eagle sits on his arm. It is then revealed that there is a group of people who are against this prophecy which also includes Lakshmi and  the reporters. When in station with the drama artists they reveal that a map was made for the lost treasure but they had no idea about where the map would be. Narayana feels that the band master who has lost his memory may know about this. Lakshmi, along with the group who don't believe the prophecy, kidnap Narayana but he escapes from there and reaches Jayaram's fort and creates misunderstanding among the Abhiras die to which the scenes of killing the drama artists is recreated before the band master but, unfortunately nothing brings his memory back.\n\nWhile the other people whom Jayaram suspected are put in the dungeons, Narayana is also put with them for not revealing the truth of the group of drama artists he found. However he escapes by keeping a gun on Jayaram and allows Tukaram to enter the fort and also allows a group of prisoners to escape .Once again with his wit, he escapes from the brothers who now are standing by pointing a gun at each other along with their men.\nOn the way he also finds out that the band master is also escaping and catches him and decodes his words to find out that the map to the treasure lies in the troupes last play. The prophecy also says that their Hari would also come along with his Lakshmi. Thus he convinces Lakshmi and also makes the people happy by telling that they can stage their last play.\n\nThe last play belongs to a scene from Samudra manthan but his understanding from the scene doesn't go right and tries to extends the drama but Lakshmi announces that there won't be rehearsals but directly the show.\n\nNarayana decodes the map and reaches the place of treasure along with Tukaram's people. Here Tukaram's men kidnap all the people of the troupe and burn the fort along with the troupe and there after finding the treasure Tukarama's people turn against Narayana but it happens to be that the box has full of Stones and this angers Tukaram's men and they lock Narayana in the chest and bury him. From inside the chest he decodes the actual mystery but his conscience makes him guilty thus deciding to help the drama troupe. The four prisoners whom he helped from Jayaram's prison help him outside after he escapes the chest and he reaches Jayaramas fort along with the treasure. Jayarama fights with Narayana, when he asks for a candidate for the Abira clan, Narayana places himself on the throne and tells others that his first and final order is that from now on no one need not follow the Abira way of living this leading to the escape of all the people.\n\nAfter the final fight the fort is fully destroyed and Narayana too escapes, and saves Tukaram. In the mid credit scene,  it's shown that the last part of the drama is being enacted and Narayana and Lakshmi are planning to get married. In the post credits scene, it\u2019s shown that Treasure Hunter Harishchandra makes his way into the fort\u2019s ruins using his pendulums. There, he sees a man sitting on the treasure box.
