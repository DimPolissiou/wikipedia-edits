He attended classes at Chicago's [[Old Town School of Folk Music]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/oldtownschool/status/989572224213450752 |title=John Prine OTSFM Registration Card |publisher=Old Town School of Folk Music |date=September 17, 1964 |accessdate=April 26, 2018}}</ref> After serving in [[West Germany]] with the U.S. Army, he moved to [[Chicago]] in the late 1960s, where he worked as a mailman, writing and singing songs as a hobby.\n\nA member of Chicago's [[folk revival]], he was discovered by [[Kris Kristofferson]] (although Prine himself credited film critic [[Roger Ebert]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/john-prine-roger-ebert-first-review/|title=How an Unplanned Roger Ebert Review Launched John Prine's Career|last=Wilkening|first=Matthew|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en|access-date=April 8, 2020}}</ref>), resulting in the production of Prine's [[John Prine (album)|self-titled debut album]] with [[Atlantic Records]] in 1971. After receiving critical acclaim, Prine focused on his musical career, recording three more albums for Atlantic. He then signed to [[Asylum Records]], where he recorded an additional three albums. In 1984 he co-founded [[Oh Boy Records]], an independent record label with which he would release most of his subsequent albums. After his battle with [[Squamous cell carcinoma|squamous cell cancer]] in 1998, Prine's vocals deepened into a gravelly voice.  He also recovered from lung cancer in 2013.  In 2020, two weeks after coming down with symptoms of [[COVID-19]], he died of the disease on April 7.\n\nWidely cited as one of the most influential songwriters of his generation, Prine was known for humorous lyrics about love, life, and current events, as well as serious songs with social commentary, and songs which recollect melancholy tales from his life.\n\n==Early life==\nPrine was the son of William Mason Prine, a [[Tool and die maker|tool-and-die]] maker, and Verna Valentine (Hamm), a homemaker, both from [[Muhlenberg County, Kentucky|Muhlenberg County]], [[Kentucky]].

The Bandits were a charter member of the USFL and was the only franchise to have the same principal owner ([[John F. Bassett]]), head coach ([[Steve Spurrier]]), and home field ([[Tampa Stadium]]) during the league's three seasons of play. The Bandits were successful both on the field and at the ticket booth. Spurrier's \"Bandit Ball\" offense led them to winning records and two playoff appearances, and their exciting brand of play combined with innovative local marketing helped the Bandits lead the league in attendance. However, the franchise folded along with the rest of the USFL when the league suspended play after the [[1985 USFL season|1985 season]].\n\nProminent alumni from the Bandits include future [[NFL]] [[Pro Bowl]]ers [[Nate Newton]] and [[Gary Anderson (running back)|Gary Anderson]] and coach Steve Spurrier, who spent 25 years coaching [[college football]] and was enshrined in the [[College Football Hall of Fame]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Preparing to play===\n====Origins====\nThe Tampa Bay Bandits' primary founder was [[Canadians|Canadian]] businessman [[John F. Bassett]], who was [[Mid-South Grizzlies v. NFL|still in litigation]] against the NFL over his previous [[Memphis Southmen]] franchise from the [[World Football League]] in the mid-1970s. Bassett was initially skeptical about getting into another football venture. However, he soon warmed up to the USFL after discovering that he was nowhere as well off as the other owners. While he had been by far the richest owner in the WFL, he realized that he would be one of the poorest owners in the USFL. Believing that the USFL was on far stronger financial ground than the WFL ever had been, he agreed to sign on.<ref name=Reeths>{{cite book|title=The United States Football League, 1982-1986|last=Reeths|first=Paul|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|date=2017|isbn=1476667446}}</ref>\n\nBassett's original plan was to place his team at [[Ivor Wynne Stadium]] in [[Hamilton, Ontario]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Alternative to Tiger-Cats: Bassett sees Hamilton in USFL|date=1983-03-22|first=Marty|last=York|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref> Not only was this outside the league's namesake United States, but it would have been by far the smallest market during the USFL's first season had it gone through; Bassett intended to draw from [[Southern Ontario]], the largest market in Canada when factoring in nearby [[Toronto]], and possibly from [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] as well (coincidentally, Buffalo's [[National Football League]] team, the [[Buffalo Bills]], was one of the teams most negatively impacted by the USFL's existence, even without a team less than 50 miles away from its home stadium as originally proposed). Hamilton also had the advantage of not having any other major league sports competition apart from the [[Canadian Football League]]'s [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]].\n\nHowever, Canadian government officials were dead-set against ''any'' other league challenging the CFL's monopoly on [[professional football in Canada]], even if their seasons did not overlap. [[Senate of Canada|Senator]] [[Keith Davey]], a former CFL commissioner, threatened to re-introduce the ''[[Canadian Football Act]]'', a bill originally proposed in 1974 (in the wake of Bassett's previous proposal to put a WFL team\u2013what became the Southmen\u2013in Toronto) that would have had the government endorse the CFL's monopoly and prohibited any other league from playing in Canada. Bassett's proposal came at a time when the CFL's [[Montreal Concordes]] had been saved from bankruptcy in 1981, two years prior to the USFL's launch (the Concordes would collapse again in 1987).<ref>{{cite news|title=USFL thwarted by Davey|date=1983-02-02|first=Marty|last=York|newspaper=The Globe and Mail}}</ref> Davey's threat convinced Bassett to abandon his plans in Ontario and establish the franchise in the United States. Tampa was soon chosen as the best fit.\n\n====Establishment in Tampa====\nAfter it was decided that the franchise would play in Tampa, Miami attorney Steve Arky joined Bassett as a majority owner; Arky was the son-in-law of Marvin Warner, who owned another USFL franchise, the [[Birmingham Stallions]]. Several minority owners bought stakes, among them [[Hollywood]] star [[Burt Reynolds]], a former college football player at [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]] who was one of the most popular motion picture [[actor]]s in the world. The team was soon dubbed the \"Bandits\", a name that referenced both Reynolds' role in the hit ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]'' movies and the name of [[Carling Bassett-Seguso|Bassett's daughter's]] German Shepherd.<ref>{{cite book |last= Pearlman |first= Jeff | author-link= Jeff Pearlman | title= Football for a Buck |year= 2018 |page=52 |isbn=9780544453685}}</ref><ref name=\"Burt\">{{cite news |last1=Fiallo |first1=Josh |title=From Bandits to Seminoles, Burt Reynolds left a rich Tampa sports legacy |url=https://www.tampabay.com/sports/From-Bandits-to-Seminoles-Burt-Reynolds-left-a-rich-Tampa-sports-legacy_171577733 |accessdate=17 January 2019 |work=Tampa Bay Times |date=7 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Gardner |first1=Steve |title=Famed actor Burt Reynolds had many football, sports connections |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2018/09/06/burt-reynolds-never-forgot-his-love-football-longest-yard/1214526002/ |accessdate=April 28, 2019 |work=USA TODAY |date=Sep 6, 2018 |language=en}}</ref> Reynolds was prominently involved in the Bandits' early marketing campaigns, and the cover of the team's 1983 [[media guide]] featured a photo of the actor wearing a Bandits [[trucker hat]].<ref name=\"Burt\"/>\n\nAlso building interest was the hiring of former [[Florida Gators football|Florida Gator]] and [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] quarterback [[Steve Spurrier]] to be the team's head coach. Spurrier had been the [[offensive coordinator]] at [[Duke Blue Devils football|Duke University]] for three seasons before coming to Tampa to accept his first head coaching job. His innovative offenses at Duke had broken many records, and at 37, he was the youngest head coach in professional football at the time.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ss8lAAAAIBAJ&sjid=NPMFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5903,2175082&dq=tampa-bay-bandits&hl=en The Miami News - Google News Archive Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n===Bandit Ball===\nThe Bandits began play in 1983 in [[Tampa Stadium]], and were immediately more successful than the area's [[National Football League|NFL]] franchise, the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]], with whom they shared a home field (though the Bucs played in the fall and early winter while the Bandits played in the spring and early summer). The Bandits narrowly missed the playoffs in their first season and made the postseason the next two years. Spurrier's aggressive offense was usually one of the best in the league; Bandits players are among the USFL career leaders in touchdown passes ([[John Reaves]], 4th), touchdown receptions ([[Eric Truvillion]], 2nd), and rushing touchdowns ([[Gary Anderson (running back)|Gary Anderson]], 3rd). However, an average defense and Bassett's insistence on adhering to the USFL's original financial plan while other franchises spent millions on [[free agent]] signings kept the team from serious championship contention.\n\nThe Bandits were also successful off the field. They drew the highest average attendance over the three-year history of the USFL, coming in second in attendance in 1983 and leading the league in that category in 1984 and 1985 with over 40,000 fans per game.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eO8vAAAAIBAJ&sjid=gfsDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6737,4041887&dq=tampa-bay-bandits+bucs+attendance+tampa-stadium&hl=en Lakeland Ledger - Google News Archive Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Also, their memorabilia outsold that of the Buccaneers in the Tampa Bay area. A fan-friendly atmosphere (including a theme song, \"Bandit Ball\", penned and sung by Reynolds' friend [[Jerry Reed]]<ref>http://www.usfl.info/bandits/trivia.html Tampa Bay Bandits trivia</ref>) was one factor, and the Bucs' futility during the period (they went 10\u201338 from 1983 to 1985\u2014the start of a 12-year stretch of 10-loss seasons) also helped the Bandits' success. Another key factor in the Bandits' success was the fact that there was no [[Major League Baseball]] team in Tampa at the time (the [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] would not debut for another decade), meaning that unlike other USFL teams, they did not have to compete with a baseball team for spectators. Due to broad local support, the Bandits were one of a very few USFL teams with a stable home and steady finances - they were the only franchise to have the same coach, owner, and home city throughout the league's three-year existence.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1119528/index.htm Rebels with a good cause from [[Sports Illustrated]] ]</ref> Due to these factors, the Bandits are considered one of the few USFL teams that had the potential to be a viable venture had the league been better run.<ref>[http://www.tboblogs.com/index.php/sports/story/happy-anniversary-bandits-you-were-fun/ Breakfast Bonus - Tom McEwen- from TBO.com Sports<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716194713/http://www.tboblogs.com/index.php/sports/story/happy-anniversary-bandits-you-were-fun/ |date=2011-07-16 }}</ref> The [[Philadelphia Stars (football)|Philadelphia Stars]] played Tampa Bay at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] in an exhibition game on July 21, 1984.\n\n===1983 season===\n====1983 schedule and results====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

However, to gain a competitive advantage and draw attention to their teams, some owners attempted to sign more high-profile players to free agent contracts, sometimes engaging in bidding wars against more financially powerful NFL teams. This led to USFL teams losing substantial amounts of money, causing much instability throughout the league. The Bandits did not overspend on player contracts, keeping the franchise stable but making it difficult to compete with the USFL's higher-spending teams, despite making a very good account of themselves on the field.\n\nIn April 1985, the USFL (led by [[New Jersey Generals]] owner [[Donald Trump]]<ref name=\"trump2\">{{cite web | url=http://espn.go.com/espn/story/_/id/13255737/five-things-know-donald-trump-usfl-experience | title=5 things to know about Donald Trump's foray into doomed USFL | publisher=ESPN | date=July 7, 2014 | accessdate=20 October 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"trump1\">{{cite news | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/trump-defends-usfl-readies-bid-bills-article-1.1780131 | title=Donald Trump defends USFL past | work=New York Daily News | date=May 5, 2014 | accessdate=20 October 2015}}</ref>) voted 12-2 to switch to a fall schedule for 1986, hoping to compete directly with the NFL and possibly force the more established league to accept a merger. Bassett, who had registered one of the two \"nay\" votes, immediately declared his intention to pull the Bandits out of the USFL and organize a new spring football league.<ref name=\"mizell\">{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4R5RAAAAIBAJ&sjid=RmYDAAAAIBAJ&dq=john-bassett%20bandits&pg=3946%2C6765755 | title=By its own hand, USFL will fall into oblivion | work=St. Petersburg Times | date=30 April 1985 | accessdate=1 March 2014 | author=Mizell, Hubert | pages=1C}}</ref><ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4R5RAAAAIBAJ&sjid=RmYDAAAAIBAJ&dq=john-bassett%20bandits&pg=6235%2C6592417 \"Bassett will pull Bandits out of USFL\" - St. Pete Times: April 30, 1985]</ref>\n\nHowever, by mid-1985, the Bandits' ownership group was in disarray. Bassett was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer, and staffers suspected that his illness was impairing his judgment. At the same time, co-owner Steve Arky's wealth was raided by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] on fraud charges, triggering the [[savings and loan crisis]]; Arky committed suicide not long after.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-1985-07-24-8501300628-story.html|title=Miami lawyer kills himself in wake of ESM|work=South Florida Sun-Sentinel|date=July 24, 1985|first=Joseph|last=Cosco|accessdate=May 27, 2019}}</ref> The team began signing mediocre players, most infamously defensive back [[Bret Clark]], to large contracts, and plans for a new spring football league were abandoned.

After the [[United States Football League#USFL v. NFL lawsuit|USFL's anti-trust lawsuit against the NFL]] failed in July 1986, the league suspended operations, leaving its remaining franchises in limbo.\n\nIn March 1986, Bret Clark took the Bandits to arbitration for $159,980 in back pay owed under his contract. He won the case on May 29, but the Bandits did not have any funds available to pay the judgement, as Scarfone and Cunningham had gone into considerable debt to buy the team and had already depleted most of their assets.<ref name=scarfone/>  On August 4, a federal judge placed a [[lien]] on the franchise and ordered that the franchise's remaining assets -  including everything from weight-lifting equipment to office furniture to memorabilia from the team store - be confiscated to pay off the debt, all but ending any realistic chance of the Bandits returning to the field. Coincidentally, the USFL  canceled its 1986 season on the same day, though the league did not formally shut down until 1988.<ref name=sptimes86>Scheiber, Dave.

The Bandits were a charter member of the USFL and was the only franchise to have the same principal owner ([[John F. Bassett]]), head coach ([[Steve Spurrier]]), and home field ([[Tampa Stadium]]) during the league's three seasons of play. The Bandits were successful both on the field and at the ticket booth. Spurrier's \"Bandit Ball\" offense led them to winning records and two playoff appearances, and their exciting brand of play combined with innovative local marketing helped the Bandits lead the league in attendance. However, the franchise folded along with the rest of the USFL when the league suspended play after the [[1985 USFL season|1985 season]].\n\nProminent alumni from the Bandits include future [[NFL]] [[Pro Bowl]]ers [[Nate Newton]] and [[Gary Anderson (running back)|Gary Anderson]] and coach Steve Spurrier, who spent 25 years coaching [[college football]] and was enshrined in the [[College Football Hall of Fame]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Preparing to play===\n====Origins====\nThe Tampa Bay Bandits' primary founder was [[Canadians|Canadian]] businessman [[John F. Bassett]], who was [[Mid-South Grizzlies v. NFL|still in litigation]] against the NFL over his previous [[Memphis Southmen]] franchise from the [[World Football League]] in the mid-1970s. Bassett was initially skeptical about getting into another football venture. However, he soon warmed up to the USFL after discovering that he was nowhere as well off as the other owners. While he had been by far the richest owner in the WFL, he realized that he would be one of the poorest owners in the USFL. Believing that the USFL was on far stronger financial ground than the WFL ever had been, he agreed to sign on.<ref name=Reeths>{{cite book|title=The United States Football League, 1982-1986|last=Reeths|first=Paul|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|date=2017|isbn=1476667446}}</ref>\n\nBassett's original plan was to place his team at [[Ivor Wynne Stadium]] in [[Hamilton, Ontario]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Alternative to Tiger-Cats: Bassett sees Hamilton in USFL|date=1983-03-22|first=Marty|last=York|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref> Not only was this outside the league's namesake United States, but it would have been by far the smallest market during the USFL's first season had it gone through; Bassett intended to draw from [[Southern Ontario]], the largest market in Canada when factoring in nearby [[Toronto]], and possibly from [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] as well (coincidentally, Buffalo's [[National Football League]] team, the [[Buffalo Bills]], was one of the teams most negatively impacted by the USFL's existence, even without a team less than 50 miles away from its home stadium as originally proposed). Hamilton also had the advantage of not having any other major league sports competition apart from the [[Canadian Football League]]'s [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]].\n\nHowever, Canadian government officials were dead-set against ''any'' other league challenging the CFL's monopoly on [[professional football in Canada]], even if their seasons did not overlap. [[Senate of Canada|Senator]] [[Keith Davey]], a former CFL commissioner, threatened to re-introduce the ''[[Canadian Football Act]]'', a bill originally proposed in 1974 (in the wake of Bassett's previous proposal to put a WFL team\u2013what became the Southmen\u2013in Toronto) that would have had the government endorse the CFL's monopoly and prohibited any other league from playing in Canada. Bassett's proposal came at a time when the CFL's [[Montreal Concordes]] had been saved from bankruptcy in 1981, two years prior to the USFL's launch (the Concordes would collapse again in 1987).<ref>{{cite news|title=USFL thwarted by Davey|date=1983-02-02|first=Marty|last=York|newspaper=The Globe and Mail}}</ref> Davey's threat convinced Bassett to abandon his plans in Ontario and establish the franchise in the United States. Tampa was soon chosen as the best fit.\n\n====Establishment in Tampa====\nAfter it was decided that the franchise would play in Tampa, Miami attorney Steve Arky joined Bassett as a majority owner; Arky was the son-in-law of Marvin Warner, who owned another USFL franchise, the [[Birmingham Stallions]]. Several minority owners bought stakes, among them [[Hollywood]] star [[Burt Reynolds]], a former college football player at [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]] who was one of the most popular motion picture [[actor]]s in the world. The team was soon dubbed the \"Bandits\", a name that referenced both Reynolds' role in the hit ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]'' movies and the name of [[Carling Bassett-Seguso|Bassett's daughter's]] German Shepherd.<ref>{{cite book |last= Pearlman |first= Jeff | author-link= Jeff Pearlman | title= Football for a Buck |year= 2018 |page=52 |isbn=9780544453685}}</ref><ref name=\"Burt\">{{cite news |last1=Fiallo |first1=Josh |title=From Bandits to Seminoles, Burt Reynolds left a rich Tampa sports legacy |url=https://www.tampabay.com/sports/From-Bandits-to-Seminoles-Burt-Reynolds-left-a-rich-Tampa-sports-legacy_171577733 |accessdate=17 January 2019 |work=Tampa Bay Times |date=7 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Gardner |first1=Steve |title=Famed actor Burt Reynolds had many football, sports connections |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2018/09/06/burt-reynolds-never-forgot-his-love-football-longest-yard/1214526002/ |accessdate=April 28, 2019 |work=USA TODAY |date=Sep 6, 2018 |language=en}}</ref> Reynolds was prominently involved in the Bandits' early marketing campaigns, and the cover of the team's 1983 [[media guide]] featured a photo of the actor wearing a Bandits [[trucker hat]].<ref name=\"Burt\"/>\n\nAlso building interest was the hiring of former [[Florida Gators football|Florida Gator]] and [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] quarterback [[Steve Spurrier]] to be the team's head coach. Spurrier had been the [[offensive coordinator]] at [[Duke Blue Devils football|Duke University]] for three seasons before coming to Tampa to accept his first head coaching job. His innovative offenses at Duke had broken many records, and at 37, he was the youngest head coach in professional football at the time.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ss8lAAAAIBAJ&sjid=NPMFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5903,2175082&dq=tampa-bay-bandits&hl=en The Miami News - Google News Archive Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n===Bandit Ball===\nThe Bandits began play in 1983 in [[Tampa Stadium]], and were immediately more successful than the area's [[National Football League|NFL]] franchise, the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]], with whom they shared a home field (though the Bucs played in the fall and early winter while the Bandits played in the spring and early summer). The Bandits narrowly missed the playoffs in their first season and made the postseason the next two years. Spurrier's aggressive offense was usually one of the best in the league; Bandits players are among the USFL career leaders in touchdown passes ([[John Reaves]], 4th), touchdown receptions ([[Eric Truvillion]], 2nd), and rushing touchdowns ([[Gary Anderson (running back)|Gary Anderson]], 3rd). However, an average defense and Bassett's insistence on adhering to the USFL's original financial plan while other franchises spent millions on [[free agent]] signings kept the team from serious championship contention.\n\nThe Bandits were also successful off the field. They drew the highest average attendance over the three-year history of the USFL, coming in second in attendance in 1983 and leading the league in that category in 1984 and 1985 with over 40,000 fans per game.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eO8vAAAAIBAJ&sjid=gfsDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6737,4041887&dq=tampa-bay-bandits+bucs+attendance+tampa-stadium&hl=en Lakeland Ledger - Google News Archive Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Also, their memorabilia outsold that of the Buccaneers in the Tampa Bay area. A fan-friendly atmosphere (including a theme song, \"Bandit Ball\", penned and sung by Reynolds' friend [[Jerry Reed]]<ref>http://www.usfl.info/bandits/trivia.html Tampa Bay Bandits trivia</ref>) was one factor, and the Bucs' futility during the period (they went 10\u201338 from 1983 to 1985\u2014the start of a 12-year stretch of 10-loss seasons) also helped the Bandits' success. Another key factor in the Bandits' success was the fact that there was no [[Major League Baseball]] team in Tampa at the time (the [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] would not debut for another decade), meaning that unlike other USFL teams, they did not have to compete with a baseball team for spectators. Due to broad local support, the Bandits were one of a very few USFL teams with a stable home and steady finances - they were the only franchise to have the same coach, owner, and home city throughout the league's three-year existence.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1119528/index.htm Rebels with a good cause from [[Sports Illustrated]] ]</ref> Due to these factors, the Bandits are considered one of the few USFL teams that had the potential to be a viable venture had the league been better run.<ref>[http://www.tboblogs.com/index.php/sports/story/happy-anniversary-bandits-you-were-fun/ Breakfast Bonus - Tom McEwen- from TBO.com Sports<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716194713/http://www.tboblogs.com/index.php/sports/story/happy-anniversary-bandits-you-were-fun/ |date=2011-07-16 }}</ref> The [[Philadelphia Stars (football)|Philadelphia Stars]] played Tampa Bay at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] in an exhibition game on July 21, 1984.\n\n===1983 season===\n====1983 schedule and results====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

However, to gain a competitive advantage and draw attention to their teams, some owners attempted to sign more high-profile players to free agent contracts, sometimes engaging in bidding wars against more financially powerful NFL teams. This led to USFL teams losing substantial amounts of money, causing much instability throughout the league. The Bandits did not overspend on player contracts, keeping the franchise stable but making it difficult to compete with the USFL's higher-spending teams, despite making a very good account of themselves on the field.\n\nIn April 1985, the USFL (led by [[New Jersey Generals]] owner [[Donald Trump]]<ref name=\"trump2\">{{cite web | url=http://espn.go.com/espn/story/_/id/13255737/five-things-know-donald-trump-usfl-experience | title=5 things to know about Donald Trump's foray into doomed USFL | publisher=ESPN | date=July 7, 2014 | accessdate=20 October 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"trump1\">{{cite news | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/trump-defends-usfl-readies-bid-bills-article-1.1780131 | title=Donald Trump defends USFL past | work=New York Daily News | date=May 5, 2014 | accessdate=20 October 2015}}</ref>) voted 12-2 to switch to a fall schedule for 1986, hoping to compete directly with the NFL and possibly force the more established league to accept a merger. Bassett, who had registered one of the two \"nay\" votes, immediately declared his intention to pull the Bandits out of the USFL and organize a new spring football league.<ref name=\"mizell\">{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4R5RAAAAIBAJ&sjid=RmYDAAAAIBAJ&dq=john-bassett%20bandits&pg=3946%2C6765755 | title=By its own hand, USFL will fall into oblivion | work=St. Petersburg Times | date=30 April 1985 | accessdate=1 March 2014 | author=Mizell, Hubert | pages=1C}}</ref><ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4R5RAAAAIBAJ&sjid=RmYDAAAAIBAJ&dq=john-bassett%20bandits&pg=6235%2C6592417 \"Bassett will pull Bandits out of USFL\" - St. Pete Times: April 30, 1985]</ref>\n\nHowever, by mid-1985, the Bandits' ownership group was in disarray. Bassett was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer, and staffers suspected that his illness was impairing his judgment. At the same time, co-owner Steve Arky's wealth was raided by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] on fraud charges, triggering the [[savings and loan crisis]]; Arky committed suicide not long after.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-1985-07-24-8501300628-story.html|title=Miami lawyer kills himself in wake of ESM|work=South Florida Sun-Sentinel|date=July 24, 1985|first=Joseph|last=Cosco|accessdate=May 27, 2019}}</ref> The team began signing mediocre players, most infamously defensive back [[Bret Clark]], to large contracts, and plans for a new spring football league were abandoned.

After the [[United States Football League#USFL v. NFL lawsuit|USFL's anti-trust lawsuit against the NFL]] failed in July 1986, the league suspended operations, leaving its remaining franchises in limbo.\n\nIn March 1986, Bret Clark took the Bandits to arbitration for $159,980 in back pay owed under his contract. He won the case on May 29, but the Bandits did not have any funds available to pay the judgement, as Scarfone and Cunningham had gone into considerable debt to buy the team and had already depleted most of their assets.<ref name=scarfone/>  On August 4, a federal judge placed a [[lien]] on the franchise and ordered that the franchise's remaining assets -  including everything from weight-lifting equipment to office furniture to memorabilia from the team store - be confiscated to pay off the debt, all but ending any realistic chance of the Bandits returning to the field. Coincidentally, the USFL  canceled its 1986 season on the same day, though the league did not formally shut down until 1988.<ref name=sptimes86>Scheiber, Dave.
