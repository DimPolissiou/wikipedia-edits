The [[etymological dictionary]] was among the first of its type published in Europe in a [[vernacular]] language.\n\n==Original publication==\nSebasti\u00e1n de Covarrubias began writing what would become the ''Tesoro de la lengua castellana o espa\u00f1ola'' in the spring of 1605. He completed the work over the course of three years, writing in [[Valencia]] and [[Cuenca (Spain)|Cuenca]]. Covarrubias, who was sixty-six years old when he began the project, decided to reduce the number of [[word]]s after the letter {{angle bracket|C}}, fearing he may die before finishing the project.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Carriazo Ruiz |first1=Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n |last2=Mancho Duque |first2=Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas |chapter=Los comienzos de la lexicograf\u00eda monoling\u00fce |trans-chapter=The beginnings of monolingual lexicography |editor=Antonia M.

Covarrubias adopted Isidore's idea that [[etymological fallacy|the original form of a word is related to its original meaning]], so that investigating etymology reveals the origin and deeper meaning of things. The quality of Covarrubias's etymologies were prone to fanciful speculation, in line with other etymological work of the time. He was especially interested in connecting Spanish words to [[Biblical Hebrew|Hebrew]], which was considered the [[original language of humanity]] before the [[Tower of Babel]]. Covarrubias was also aware of contemporary work in [[lexicography]] from other countries, including Jean Pallet's ''Dictionnaire tr\u00e8s ample de la langue espagnole et fran\u00e7oise'' [''Very Copious Dictionary of the Spanish and French Language''] (Paris, 1604) and Jean Nicot's ''Tr\u00e9sor de la langue fran\u00e7ais'' [''Treasury of the French Language''] (Paris, 1606). He aimed to give foreigners a sense of the propriety and elegance of the Spanish language, to the honor of the Spanish nation (\"''dar noticia a los extranjeros del lenguaje espa\u00f1ol, y de su propiedad y elegancia, que es muy gran honor de la naci\u00f3n espa\u00f1ola''\").<ref>{{Cite book |last=Covarrubias |first=Sebasti\u00e1n |editor=Ignacio Arellano and Rafael Zafra |title=Tesoro de la lengua castellana o espa\u00f1ola |version=edici\u00f3n integral e ilustrada |location=Madrid |publisher=Iberoamericana-Vervuert |year=2006 |language=Spanish |isbn=8484890740}}</ref>\n\n===Organization===\nThe lexicon consists of about 11,000 entries. Including words that do not have their own entry but are defined in sections treating other words, the number of etymologies rises to about 17,000 according to [[Mart\u00ed de Riquer i Morera|Mart\u00ed de Riquer]].\n\nThe lexicon features gaps and inconsistencies in [[alphabetic order]]. Spelling reflects the instability of written Spanish prior to the establishment of the [[Spanish Academy]], so that a single word may be spelled several different ways in different sections of the book. Covarrubias was a supporter of [[phonetic spelling]], but his own spelling was not always consistent with the principle.\n\nThe book takes a broad view of the lexicon, including [[Dialect|regionalisms]] (especially from [[Old Castile]], [[Kingdom of Toledo|Toledo]], and [[Andalusia]]), [[slang]], [[jargon]], and [[archaism]]s. The length of entries is uneven, ranging from a few lines to as many as eight pages. Most entries are between ten and twenty lines.\n\nSome entries are organized by [[lexeme]], including several words with the same [[Root (linguistics)|root]], which can make searches difficult. [[Polysemy|Polysemic]] words \u2013 those with several related meanings \u2013 are sometimes given separate entries, but sometimes treated within a single article.

The supplement included new items as well as additions to articles in the original publication. This included a total of 2,179 articles, most corresponding to [[proper name]]s. Only 429 items in the supplement treated common words; 219 of these were new entries.

Noydens' volume added 326 new entries, consisting mainly of encyclopedic information taken from the ''[[Glosario de voces oscuras]]'' [Glossary of Obscure Voices] by [[Alejo Venegas]].\n\nCovarrubias achieved greater recognition after the founding of the [[Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola]] [Royal Spanish Academy] in 1713. The Academy relied on the ''Treasure'' as a major source for its own ''[[Diccionario de autoridades]]'' (1726-1739), the authoritative dictionary now known as the ''[[Diccionario de la lengua espa\u00f1ola]]''. In the preface to the ''Diccionario de autoridades'' the academy recognizes Covarrubias' work as a predecessor in the scholarly canon.\n\nOther dictionaries also rely on content from the ''Treasure'', particularly multilingual dictionaries and other seventeenth century dictionaries of Spanish.

He made a total of 15 appearances for the [[Denmark national football team|Danish national team]], which he represented in the [[1992 UEFA European Football Championship|1992 European Championship]] and [[1996 UEFA European Football Championship|1996 European Championship]].\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in [[Hellerup]], Piechnik started his senior career with [[Kj\u00f8benhavns Boldklub]] (KB) in the top-flight [[Danish 1st Division]]. He joined [[Ikast fS]] in 1988, and played two seasons for the club. In 1990, he joined [[B 1903]], and in November 1991 he won his first Danish senior cap. He was part of the Danish national squad which won the 1992 European Championship. He started the tournament as a substitute, but when [[Henrik Andersen]] suffered an injury in the semi-finals, Piechnik replaced him in the final, for which he earned praise.<ref name=\"where\">Hugh Larkin, [https://web.archive.org/web/20050418110950/http://www.squarefootball.net/article/inbrief.asp?iid=872 Whatever Happened to: Torben Piechnik (Liverpool)] at ''SquareFootball.net''</ref>\n\nAfter the tournament, he followed the majority of the B 1903 players into the merging [[FC Copenhagen]] (FCK) club. Having played just seven league games for FCK, he was signed for [[England|English]] [[FA Cup]] holders [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] by manager [[Graeme Souness]] in September 1992, just weeks after the inception of the new [[Premier League]]. He joined a struggling Liverpool side, and had a hard time adapting to the English game.<ref name=\"where\"/><ref name=\"danishdan\">Torben Piechnik, [http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/drilldown/NG151391060209-1434.htm WHY DANISH DAN WILL BE THE MAN FOR REDS], ''[[Liverpool F.C.]]'',  February 9, 2006</ref> Piechnik made 16 first-team league appearances for Liverpool in the [[1992-93 in English football|1992-93 season]], but only managed one in the whole of the [[1993-94 in English football|1993-94 season]]. When Graeme Souness was replaced by new manager [[Roy Evans]] in January 1994, Piechnik sensed that he was no longer part of the club's plans, and requested a transfer. His lack of success in Liverpool later earned him a selection in the [[Liverpool Echo]]'s ''Merseyside Lost 11'', a selection of players which the newspaper considered the biggest fiascos in the history of Liverpool and [[Everton F.C.|Everton]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Top Ten: Players who made us both laugh and cry|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/top-ten-players-who-made-3460021|publisher=[[Liverpool Echo]]|accessdate=21 May 2014|date=21 February 2009}}</ref>\n\nHe transferred to [[Aarhus Gymnastik Forening|AGF Aarhus]] in Denmark at the end of the season. He won the 1996 [[Danish Cup]] with AGF, and was called up to represent Denmark at the 1996 European Championship.

He made a total of 15 appearances for the [[Denmark national football team|Danish national team]], which he represented in the [[1992 UEFA European Football Championship|1992 European Championship]] and [[1996 UEFA European Football Championship|1996 European Championship]].\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in [[Hellerup]], Piechnik started his senior career with [[Kj\u00f8benhavns Boldklub]] (KB) in the top-flight [[Danish 1st Division]]. He joined [[Ikast fS]] in 1988, and played two seasons for the club. In 1990, he joined [[B 1903]], and in November 1991 he won his first Danish senior cap. He was part of the Danish national squad which won the 1992 European Championship. He started the tournament as a substitute, but when [[Henrik Andersen]] suffered an injury in the semi-finals, Piechnik replaced him in the final, for which he earned praise.<ref name=\"where\">Hugh Larkin, [https://web.archive.org/web/20050418110950/http://www.squarefootball.net/article/inbrief.asp?iid=872 Whatever Happened to: Torben Piechnik (Liverpool)] at ''SquareFootball.net''</ref>\n\nAfter the tournament, he followed the majority of the B 1903 players into the merging [[FC Copenhagen]] (FCK) club. Having played just seven league games for FCK, he was signed for [[England|English]] [[FA Cup]] holders [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] by manager [[Graeme Souness]] in September 1992, just weeks after the inception of the new [[Premier League]]. He joined a struggling Liverpool side, and had a hard time adapting to the English game.<ref name=\"where\"/><ref name=\"danishdan\">Torben Piechnik, [http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/drilldown/NG151391060209-1434.htm WHY DANISH DAN WILL BE THE MAN FOR REDS], ''[[Liverpool F.C.]]'',  February 9, 2006</ref> Piechnik made 16 first-team league appearances for Liverpool in the [[1992-93 in English football|1992-93 season]], but only managed one in the whole of the [[1993-94 in English football|1993-94 season]]. When Graeme Souness was replaced by new manager [[Roy Evans]] in January 1994, Piechnik sensed that he was no longer part of the club's plans, and requested a transfer. His lack of success in Liverpool later earned him a selection in the [[Liverpool Echo]]'s ''Merseyside Lost 11'', a selection of players which the newspaper considered the biggest fiascos in the history of Liverpool and [[Everton F.C.|Everton]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Top Ten: Players who made us both laugh and cry|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/top-ten-players-who-made-3460021|publisher=[[Liverpool Echo]]|accessdate=21 May 2014|date=21 February 2009}}</ref>\n\nHe transferred to [[Aarhus Gymnastik Forening|AGF Aarhus]] in Denmark at the end of the season.
