A member of the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] (WSPU) and a militant fighter for her cause, she was arrested on nine occasions, went on [[hunger strike]] seven times and was [[force fed]] on forty-nine occasions. She died after being hit by [[George V|King George V]]'s horse Anmer at the [[1913 Epsom Derby|1913 Derby]] when she walked onto the track during the race.\n\nDavison grew up in a middle-class family, and studied at [[Royal Holloway, University of London|Royal Holloway College]], London, and [[St Hugh's College, Oxford]], before taking jobs as a teacher and governess. She joined the WSPU in November 1906 and became an officer of the organisation and a chief steward during marches. She soon became known in the organisation for her daring militant action; her tactics included breaking windows, throwing stones, setting fire to postboxes and, on three occasions, hiding overnight in the [[Palace of Westminster]]\u2014including on the night of the 1911 census. Her funeral on 14 June 1913 was organised by the WSPU. A procession of 5,000 suffragettes and their supporters accompanied her coffin and 50,000 people lined the route through London; her coffin was then taken by train to the family plot in [[Morpeth, Northumberland]].\n\nDavison was a [[Christian feminism|staunch feminist and passionate Christian]], and considered that [[socialism]] was a moral and political force for good. Much of her life has been interpreted through the manner of her death. She gave no prior explanation for what she planned to do at the Derby and the uncertainty of her motives and intentions has affected how she has been judged by history. Several theories have been put forward, including accident, suicide, or an attempt to pin a suffragette banner to the king's horse.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life and education===\n[[File:Emily Davison, 1908.jpg|thumb|upright|Davison in 1908]]\nEmily Wilding Davison was born at Roxburgh House, Greenwich, in south-east London on 11 October 1872.

When her parents moved the family back to London she went to a day school, then spent a year studying in [[Dunkirk]], France.{{sfn|Colmore|1988|pp=5, 9}} When she was 13 she attended [[Kensington Preparatory School|Kensington High School]] and later won a [[bursary]] to [[Royal Holloway, University of London|Royal Holloway College]] in 1891 to study literature. Her father died in early 1893 and she was forced to end her studies because her mother could not afford the fees of \u00a320 a term.{{sfn|Sleight|1988|pp=26\u201327}}{{efn|\u00a320 in 1892 equates to approximately \u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|20|1892|r=-2}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} pounds, according to calculations based on [[Consumer Price Index (United Kingdom)|Consumer Price Index]] measure of inflation.{{inflation-fn|UK|df=yes}}}}\n\nOn leaving Holloway, Davison became a live-in [[governess]], and continued studying in the evenings.{{sfn|Colmore|1988|p=15}} She saved enough money to enrol at [[St Hugh's College, Oxford]], for one term to sit her [[Final examination|finals]];{{efn|At the time of Davison's studies, Holloway was not a constituent school of the [[University of London]] and could not award degrees, so her studies were for the qualification of the Oxford Honour School.{{sfn|Abrams|2003|p=161}}}} she achieved [[first-class honours]] in English, but could not graduate because degrees from Oxford were closed to women.{{sfn|Crawford|2003|p=159}} She worked briefly at a [[church school]] in [[Edgbaston]] between 1895 and 1896, but found it difficult and moved to Seabury, a [[private school]] in [[Worthing]], where she was more settled; she left the town in 1898 and became a private tutor and governess to a family in [[Northamptonshire]].{{sfn|Crawford|2003|p=159}}{{sfn|Tanner|2013|p=160}}{{sfn|Sleight|1988|pp=28\u201330}} In 1902 she began reading for a degree at the [[University of London]]; she graduated with [[third-class honours]] in 1908.{{sfn|Tanner|2013|p=161}}{{efn|Sources differ over the subject of her degree.

H. Asquith]],{{sfn|Crawford|2003|p=160}} the march ended in a fracas with police, and she was arrested for \"assaulting the police in the execution of their duty\". She was sentenced to a month in prison.{{sfn|A. J. R.|1913|p=221}}{{sfn|Tanner|2013|p=167}} After her release she wrote to ''Votes for Women'', the WSPU's newspaper, saying that \"Through my humble work in this noblest of all causes I have come into a fullness of job and an interest in living which I never before experienced.\"{{sfn|Davison, ''Votes for Women'', 1909}}\n\n[[File:Forcefeeding.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=A woman in prison is tied to a chair while four members of staff force feed her|A suffragette being force-fed in [[HM Prison Holloway|Holloway prison]], {{circa}}&nbsp;1911]]\nIn July 1909 Davison was arrested with fellow suffragettes [[Mary Leigh]] and [[Alice Paul]] for interrupting a public meeting from which women were barred, held by the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[David Lloyd George]]; she was sentenced to two months for obstruction. She went on [[Hunger strike#British and American suffragettes|hunger strike]] and was released after five and a half days,{{sfn|Crawford|2003|p=160}}{{sfn|Colmore|1988|pp=21\u201322}} during which time she lost {{convert|21|lb|kg}}; she stated that she \"felt very weak\" as a result.{{sfn|Gullickson|2008|p=465}} She was arrested again in September the same year for throwing stones to break windows at a political meeting; the assembly, which was to protest at the [[People's Budget|1909 budget]], was only open to men. She was sent to [[Strangeways prison]] for two months. She again went on hunger strike and was released after two and a half days.{{sfn|Colmore|1988|p=24}} She subsequently wrote to ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'' to justify her action of throwing stones as one \"which was meant as a warning to the general public of the personal risk they run in future if they go to Cabinet Ministers' meetings anywhere\". She went on to write that this was justified because of the \"unconstitutional action of Cabinet Ministers in addressing 'public meetings' from which a large section of the public is excluded\".{{sfn|Davison, ''The Manchester Guardian'', 1909}}{{sfn|Bearman|2007|p=878}}\n\nDavison was arrested again in early October 1909, while preparing to throw a stone at the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|cabinet minister]] [[Walter Runciman, 1st Viscount Runciman of Doxford|Sir Walter Runciman]]; she acted in the mistaken belief the car in which he travelled contained Lloyd George. A suffragette colleague\u2014[[Lady Constance Bulwer-Lytton|Constance Lytton]]\u2014threw hers first, before the police managed to intervene. Davison was charged with attempted assault, but released; Lytton was imprisoned for a month.{{sfn|Colmore|1988|pp=24\u201325}} Davison used her court appearances to give speeches; excerpts and quotes from these were published in the newspapers.{{sfn|Stanley|1995|p=236}} Two weeks later she threw stones at Runciman at a political meeting in [[Radcliffe, Greater Manchester]]; she was arrested and sentenced to a week's [[hard labour]]. She again went on hunger strike, but the government had authorised the use of [[Force-feeding#United Kingdom|force-feeding]] on prisoners.{{sfn|A. J. R.|1913|p=221}}{{sfn|Purvis|2013a|p=355}} The historian Gay Gullickson describes the tactic as \"extremely painful, psychologically harrowing, and raised the possibility of dying in jail from medical error or official misjudgment\".{{sfn|Gullickson|2008|p=465}} Davison said that the experience \"will haunt me with its horror all my life, and is almost indescribable.&nbsp;... The torture was barbaric\".{{sfn|Collette|2013|p=133}} Following the first episode of forced feeding, and to prevent a repeat of the experience, Davison barricaded herself in her cell using her bed and a stool and refused to allow the prison authorities to enter. They broke one of the window panes to the cell and turned a fire hose on her for 15 minutes, while attempting to force the door open. By the time the door was opened, the cell was six inches deep in water. She was taken to the prison hospital where she was warmed by hot water bottles. She was force-fed shortly afterwards and released after eight days.{{sfn|Gullickson|2008|pp=468\u2013469}}{{sfn|Collette|2013|pp=133\u2013135}} Davison's treatment prompted the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] MP [[Keir Hardie]] to ask a question in the House of Commons about the \"assault committed on a woman prisoner in Strangeways\";{{sfn|Hardie, 1909}} Davison sued the prison authorities for the use of the hose and, in January 1910, she was awarded 40 [[Shilling (British coin)|shillings]] in damages.{{sfn|Colmore|1988|pp=32\u201333}}\n\nIn April 1910 Davison decided to gain entry to the floor of the House of Commons to ask Asquith about the vote for women. She entered the [[Palace of Westminster]] with other members of the public and made her way into the heating system, where she hid overnight. On a trip from her hiding place to find water, she was arrested by a policeman, but not prosecuted.{{sfn|Sleight|1988|pp=42\u201343}}{{sfn|\"Emily Wilding Davison found hiding in a ventilation shaft\"}} The same month she became an employee of the WSPU and began to write for ''Votes for Women''.{{sfn|Colmore|1988|pp=36\u201337}}{{sfn|Purvis|2013a|p=356}}{{efn|Although some sources, including Colmore and Purvis, state that Davison was employed in the Information Department of the union, the journalist [[Fran Abrams]] writes that Davison was never a salaried member of WSPU staff, but she was paid for the articles she provided for ''Votes for Women''.{{sfn|Abrams|2003|p=167}}}}\n\nA bipartisan group of MPs formed a Conciliation Committee in early 1910 and proposed a [[Conciliation Bill]] that would have brought the vote to a million women, so long as they owned property. While the bill was being discussed, the WSPU put in a temporary truce on activity. The bill failed that November when Asquith's [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] government reneged on a promise to allow parliamentary time to debate the bill.{{sfn|Foot|2005|pp=210\u2013211}} A WSPU delegation of around 300 women tried to present him with a petition, but were prevented from doing so by an aggressive police response; the suffragettes, who called the day [[Black Friday (1910)|Black Friday]], complained of assault, much of which was sexual in nature.{{sfn|Gullickson|2008|p=470}}{{sfn|Purvis|2002|p=150}} Davison was not one of the 122 people arrested, but was incensed by the treatment of the delegation; the following day she broke several windows in the [[Clerk of the Crown in Chancery|Crown Office]] in parliament. She was arrested and sentenced to a month in prison. She went on hunger strike again and was force-fed for eight days before being released.{{sfn|Crawford|2003|p=161}}{{efn|Despite the loss of the Conciliation Bill, the WSPU maintained the truce until May 1911 when a second Conciliation Bill, having passed its Second Reading, was dropped by the government for internal political reasons. The WSPU saw this as a betrayal and resumed their militant activities.{{sfn|Foot|2005|pp=211\u2013212}}}}\n\nOn the night of the 1911 census, 2 April, Davison hid in a cupboard in [[St Mary Undercroft]], the chapel of the Palace of Westminster. She remained hidden overnight to avoid being entered onto the census; the attempt was part of a wider suffragette action to avoid being listed by the state. She was found by a cleaner, who reported her presence; Davison was arrested but not charged. The Clerk of Works at the House of Commons completed a census form to include Davison in the returns. She was included in the census twice, as her landlady also included her as being present at her lodgings.{{sfn|Liddington|Crawford|Maund|2011|pp=108, 124}}{{sfn|\"A Night in Guy Fawkes Cupboard\", ''Votes For Women'', 1911}}{{efn|Davison also spent a night in the Palace of Westminster in June 1911.{{sfn|A.

She was arrested for arson on the postbox outside parliament and admitted to setting fire to two others. Sentenced to six months in [[Holloway Prison]], she did not go on hunger strike at first, but the authorities required that she be force-fed between 29 February and 7 March 1912 because they considered her health and appetite to be in decline. In June she and other suffragette inmates barricaded themselves in their cells and went on hunger strike; the authorities broke down the cell doors and force-fed the strikers.{{sfn|Colmore|1988|pp=43\u201344}} Following the force-feeding, Davison decided on what she described as a \"desperate protest&nbsp;... made to put a stop to the hideous torture, which was now our lot\" and jumped from one of the interior balconies of the prison.{{sfn|Davison|1913|p=577}} She later wrote:\n\n<blockquote>...&nbsp;as soon as I got out I climbed on to the railing and threw myself out to the wire-netting, a distance of between 20 and 30 feet. The idea in my mind was \"one big tragedy may save many others\". I realised that my best means of carrying out my purpose was the iron staircase. When a good moment came, quite deliberately I walked upstairs and threw myself from the top, as I meant, on to the iron staircase. If I had been successful I should undoubtedly have been killed, as it was a clear drop of 30 to 40 feet. But I caught on the edge of the netting. I then threw myself forward on my head with all my might.{{sfn|Davison|1913|p=577}}</blockquote>\n\nShe cracked two [[vertebrae]] and badly injured her head. Shortly afterwards, and despite her injuries, she was again force-fed before being released ten days early.{{sfn|A. J.

If I had succeeded I am sure that forcible feeding could not in all conscience have been resorted to again.{{sfn|Davison|1912|p=4}}</blockquote>\n\nAs a result of her action Davison suffered discomfort for the rest of her life.{{sfn|Naylor|2011|p=19}} Her arson of postboxes was not authorised by the WSPU leadership and this, together with her other actions, led to her falling out of favour with the organisation; Sylvia Pankhurst later wrote that the WSPU leadership wanted \"to discourage&nbsp;...

Davison.jpg|thumb|Emily Davison wearing her [[hunger strike medal]], {{circa}} 1910\u20131912]]\n\n'''Emily Wilding Davison''' (11 October 1872&nbsp;\u2013 8 June 1913) was an English [[suffragette]] who fought for [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|votes for women]] in Britain in the early twentieth century. A member of the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] (WSPU) and a militant fighter for her cause, she was arrested on nine occasions, went on [[hunger strike]] seven times and was [[force fed]] on forty-nine occasions. She died after being hit by [[George V|King George V]]'s horse Anmer at the [[1913 Epsom Derby|1913 Derby]] when she walked onto the track during the race.\n\nDavison grew up in a middle-class family, and studied at [[Royal Holloway, University of London|Royal Holloway College]], London, and [[St Hugh's College, Oxford]], before taking jobs as a teacher and governess. She joined the WSPU in November 1906 and became an officer of the organisation and a chief steward during marches. She soon became known in the organisation for her daring militant action; her tactics included breaking windows, throwing stones, setting fire to postboxes and, on three occasions, hiding overnight in the [[Palace of Westminster]]\u2014including on the night of the 1911 census. Her funeral on 14 June 1913 was organised by the WSPU. A procession of 5,000 suffragettes and their supporters accompanied her coffin and 50,000 people lined the route through London; her coffin was then taken by train to the family plot in [[Morpeth, Northumberland]].\n\nDavison was a [[Christian feminism|staunch feminist and passionate Christian]], and considered that [[socialism]] was a moral and political force for good. Much of her life has been interpreted through the manner of her death. She gave no prior explanation for what she planned to do at the Derby and the uncertainty of her motives and intentions has affected how she has been judged by history. Several theories have been put forward, including accident, suicide, or an attempt to pin a suffragette banner to the king's horse.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life and education===\n[[File:Emily Davison, 1908.jpg|thumb|upright|Davison in 1908]]\nEmily Wilding Davison was born at Roxburgh House, Greenwich, in south-east London on 11 October 1872. Her parents were Charles Davison, a retired merchant, and Margaret ''{{nee}}'' Caisley, both of [[Morpeth, Northumberland]].{{sfn|San Vito|2008}} At the time of his marriage to Margaret in 1868, Charles was 45 and Margaret was 19.{{sfn|Sleight|1988|pp=22\u201323}} Emily was the third of four children born to the couple; her younger sister died of [[diphtheria]] in 1880 at the age of six.{{sfn|Howes|2013|loc=410\u2013422}}{{sfn|Sleight|1988|pp=22\u201324}}{{sfn|Tanner|2013|p=156}} The marriage to Margaret was Charles's second; his first marriage produced nine children before the death of his wife in 1866.{{sfn|San Vito|2008}}\n\nThe family moved to [[Sawbridgeworth]], [[Hertfordshire]], while Davison was still a baby; until the age of 11 she was educated at home. When her parents moved the family back to London she went to a day school, then spent a year studying in [[Dunkirk]], France.{{sfn|Colmore|1988|pp=5, 9}} When she was 13 she attended [[Kensington Preparatory School|Kensington High School]] and later won a [[bursary]] to [[Royal Holloway, University of London|Royal Holloway College]] in 1891 to study literature. Her father died in early 1893 and she was forced to end her studies because her mother could not afford the fees of \u00a320 a term.{{sfn|Sleight|1988|pp=26\u201327}}{{efn|\u00a320 in 1892 equates to approximately \u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|20|1892|r=-2}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} pounds, according to calculations based on [[Consumer Price Index (United Kingdom)|Consumer Price Index]] measure of inflation.{{inflation-fn|UK|df=yes}}}}\n\nOn leaving Holloway, Davison became a live-in [[governess]], and continued studying in the evenings.{{sfn|Colmore|1988|p=15}} She saved enough money to enrol at [[St Hugh's College, Oxford]], for one term to sit her [[Final examination|finals]];{{efn|At the time of Davison's studies, Holloway was not a constituent school of the [[University of London]] and could not award degrees, so her studies were for the qualification of the Oxford Honour School.{{sfn|Abrams|2003|p=161}}}} she achieved [[first-class honours]] in English, but could not graduate because degrees from Oxford were closed to women.{{sfn|Crawford|2003|p=159}} She worked briefly at a [[church school]] in [[Edgbaston]] between 1895 and 1896, but found it difficult and moved to Seabury, a [[private school]] in [[Worthing]], where she was more settled; she left the town in 1898 and became a private tutor and governess to a family in [[Northamptonshire]].{{sfn|Crawford|2003|p=159}}{{sfn|Tanner|2013|p=160}}{{sfn|Sleight|1988|pp=28\u201330}} In 1902 she began reading for a degree at the [[University of London]]; she graduated with [[third-class honours]] in 1908.{{sfn|Tanner|2013|p=161}}{{efn|Sources differ over the subject of her degree. Some state that she studied modern languages,{{sfn|San Vito|2008}}{{sfn|Tanner|2013|p=161}} others that she graduated in classics and mathematics.{{sfn|Gullickson|2008|p=464}}{{sfn|Purvis|2013a|p=354}}}}\n\n===Activism===\nDavison joined the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] (WSPU) in November 1906.{{sfn|Purvis|2013a|p=354}} Formed in 1903 by [[Emmeline Pankhurst]], the WSPU brought together those who thought that militant, confrontational tactics were needed to achieve their ultimate goal of women's suffrage.{{sfn|Naylor|2011|p=18}}{{efn|Such tactics included vandalism, [[arson]] and planting bombs.{{sfn|Webb|2014|pp=xiii\u2013xiv, 60}}}} Davison joined in the WSPU's campaigning, and became an officer of the organisation and a chief steward during marches.{{sfn|Sleight|1988|p=32}} In 1908 or 1909 she left her job teaching and dedicated herself full-time to the union.{{sfn|San Vito|2008}} She began taking increasingly confrontational actions, which prompted [[Sylvia Pankhurst]]\u2014the daughter of Emmeline and a full-time member of the WSPU\u2014to describe her as \"one of the most daring and reckless of the militants\".{{sfn|Pankhurst|2013|loc=6363}}{{sfn|Naylor|2011|p=19}} In March 1909 she was arrested for the first time; she had been part of a deputation of 21 women who marched from [[Caxton Hall]] to see the prime minister, [[H. H. Asquith]],{{sfn|Crawford|2003|p=160}} the march ended in a fracas with police, and she was arrested for \"assaulting the police in the execution of their duty\". She was sentenced to a month in prison.{{sfn|A. J. R.|1913|p=221}}{{sfn|Tanner|2013|p=167}} After her release she wrote to ''Votes for Women'', the WSPU's newspaper, saying that \"Through my humble work in this noblest of all causes I have come into a fullness of job and an interest in living which I never before experienced.\"{{sfn|Davison, ''Votes for Women'', 1909}}\n\n[[File:Forcefeeding.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=A woman in prison is tied to a chair while four members of staff force feed her|A suffragette being force-fed in [[HM Prison Holloway|Holloway prison]], {{circa}}&nbsp;1911]]\nIn July 1909 Davison was arrested with fellow suffragettes [[Mary Leigh]] and [[Alice Paul]] for interrupting a public meeting from which women were barred, held by the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[David Lloyd George]]; she was sentenced to two months for obstruction. She went on [[Hunger strike#British and American suffragettes|hunger strike]] and was released after five and a half days,{{sfn|Crawford|2003|p=160}}{{sfn|Colmore|1988|pp=21\u201322}} during which time she lost {{convert|21|lb|kg}}; she stated that she \"felt very weak\" as a result.{{sfn|Gullickson|2008|p=465}} She was arrested again in September the same year for throwing stones to break windows at a political meeting; the assembly, which was to protest at the [[People's Budget|1909 budget]], was only open to men. She was sent to [[Strangeways prison]] for two months. She again went on hunger strike and was released after two and a half days.{{sfn|Colmore|1988|p=24}} She subsequently wrote to ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'' to justify her action of throwing stones as one \"which was meant as a warning to the general public of the personal risk they run in future if they go to Cabinet Ministers' meetings anywhere\". She went on to write that this was justified because of the \"unconstitutional action of Cabinet Ministers in addressing 'public meetings' from which a large section of the public is excluded\".{{sfn|Davison, ''The Manchester Guardian'', 1909}}{{sfn|Bearman|2007|p=878}}\n\nDavison was arrested again in early October 1909, while preparing to throw a stone at the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|cabinet minister]] [[Walter Runciman, 1st Viscount Runciman of Doxford|Sir Walter Runciman]]; she acted in the mistaken belief the car in which he travelled contained Lloyd George. A suffragette colleague\u2014[[Lady Constance Bulwer-Lytton|Constance Lytton]]\u2014threw hers first, before the police managed to intervene. Davison was charged with attempted assault, but released; Lytton was imprisoned for a month.{{sfn|Colmore|1988|pp=24\u201325}} Davison used her court appearances to give speeches; excerpts and quotes from these were published in the newspapers.{{sfn|Stanley|1995|p=236}} Two weeks later she threw stones at Runciman at a political meeting in [[Radcliffe, Greater Manchester]]; she was arrested and sentenced to a week's [[hard labour]]. She again went on hunger strike, but the government had authorised the use of [[Force-feeding#United Kingdom|force-feeding]] on prisoners.{{sfn|A. J. R.|1913|p=221}}{{sfn|Purvis|2013a|p=355}} The historian Gay Gullickson describes the tactic as \"extremely painful, psychologically harrowing, and raised the possibility of dying in jail from medical error or official misjudgment\".{{sfn|Gullickson|2008|p=465}} Davison said that the experience \"will haunt me with its horror all my life, and is almost indescribable.&nbsp;... The torture was barbaric\".{{sfn|Collette|2013|p=133}} Following the first episode of forced feeding, and to prevent a repeat of the experience, Davison barricaded herself in her cell using her bed and a stool and refused to allow the prison authorities to enter. They broke one of the window panes to the cell and turned a fire hose on her for 15 minutes, while attempting to force the door open. By the time the door was opened, the cell was six inches deep in water. She was taken to the prison hospital where she was warmed by hot water bottles. She was force-fed shortly afterwards and released after eight days.{{sfn|Gullickson|2008|pp=468\u2013469}}{{sfn|Collette|2013|pp=133\u2013135}} Davison's treatment prompted the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] MP [[Keir Hardie]] to ask a question in the House of Commons about the \"assault committed on a woman prisoner in Strangeways\";{{sfn|Hardie, 1909}} Davison sued the prison authorities for the use of the hose and, in January 1910, she was awarded 40 [[Shilling (British coin)|shillings]] in damages.{{sfn|Colmore|1988|pp=32\u201333}}\n\nIn April 1910 Davison decided to gain entry to the floor of the House of Commons to ask Asquith about the vote for women. She entered the [[Palace of Westminster]] with other members of the public and made her way into the heating system, where she hid overnight. On a trip from her hiding place to find water, she was arrested by a policeman, but not prosecuted.{{sfn|Sleight|1988|pp=42\u201343}}{{sfn|\"Emily Wilding Davison found hiding in a ventilation shaft\"}} The same month she became an employee of the WSPU and began to write for ''Votes for Women''.{{sfn|Colmore|1988|pp=36\u201337}}{{sfn|Purvis|2013a|p=356}}{{efn|Although some sources, including Colmore and Purvis, state that Davison was employed in the Information Department of the union, the journalist [[Fran Abrams]] writes that Davison was never a salaried member of WSPU staff, but she was paid for the articles she provided for ''Votes for Women''.{{sfn|Abrams|2003|p=167}}}}\n\nA bipartisan group of MPs formed a Conciliation Committee in early 1910 and proposed a [[Conciliation Bill]] that would have brought the vote to a million women, so long as they owned property. While the bill was being discussed, the WSPU put in a temporary truce on activity. The bill failed that November when Asquith's [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] government reneged on a promise to allow parliamentary time to debate the bill.{{sfn|Foot|2005|pp=210\u2013211}} A WSPU delegation of around 300 women tried to present him with a petition, but were prevented from doing so by an aggressive police response; the suffragettes, who called the day [[Black Friday (1910)|Black Friday]], complained of assault, much of which was sexual in nature.{{sfn|Gullickson|2008|p=470}}{{sfn|Purvis|2002|p=150}} Davison was not one of the 122 people arrested, but was incensed by the treatment of the delegation; the following day she broke several windows in the [[Clerk of the Crown in Chancery|Crown Office]] in parliament. She was arrested and sentenced to a month in prison. She went on hunger strike again and was force-fed for eight days before being released.{{sfn|Crawford|2003|p=161}}{{efn|Despite the loss of the Conciliation Bill, the WSPU maintained the truce until May 1911 when a second Conciliation Bill, having passed its Second Reading, was dropped by the government for internal political reasons. The WSPU saw this as a betrayal and resumed their militant activities.{{sfn|Foot|2005|pp=211\u2013212}}}}\n\nOn the night of the 1911 census, 2 April, Davison hid in a cupboard in [[St Mary Undercroft]], the chapel of the Palace of Westminster. She remained hidden overnight to avoid being entered onto the census; the attempt was part of a wider suffragette action to avoid being listed by the state. She was found by a cleaner, who reported her presence; Davison was arrested but not charged. The Clerk of Works at the House of Commons completed a census form to include Davison in the returns. She was included in the census twice, as her landlady also included her as being present at her lodgings.{{sfn|Liddington|Crawford|Maund|2011|pp=108, 124}}{{sfn|\"A Night in Guy Fawkes Cupboard\", ''Votes For Women'', 1911}}{{efn|Davison also spent a night in the Palace of Westminster in June 1911.{{sfn|A.

She was arrested for arson on the postbox outside parliament and admitted to setting fire to two others. Sentenced to six months in [[Holloway Prison]], she did not go on hunger strike at first, but the authorities required that she be force-fed between 29 February and 7 March 1912 because they considered her health and appetite to be in decline. In June she and other suffragette inmates barricaded themselves in their cells and went on hunger strike; the authorities broke down the cell doors and force-fed the strikers.{{sfn|Colmore|1988|pp=43\u201344}} Following the force-feeding, Davison decided on what she described as a \"desperate protest&nbsp;... made to put a stop to the hideous torture, which was now our lot\" and jumped from one of the interior balconies of the prison.{{sfn|Davison|1913|p=577}} She later wrote:\n\n<blockquote>...&nbsp;as soon as I got out I climbed on to the railing and threw myself out to the wire-netting, a distance of between 20 and 30 feet. The idea in my mind was \"one big tragedy may save many others\". I realised that my best means of carrying out my purpose was the iron staircase. When a good moment came, quite deliberately I walked upstairs and threw myself from the top, as I meant, on to the iron staircase. If I had been successful I should undoubtedly have been killed, as it was a clear drop of 30 to 40 feet. But I caught on the edge of the netting. I then threw myself forward on my head with all my might.{{sfn|Davison|1913|p=577}}</blockquote>\n\nShe cracked two [[vertebrae]] and badly injured her head.

Under the terms of the [[One China Policy]] stipulated by the PRC, such countries may not have diplomatic relations with the Republic of China, as the PRC denies the status of ROC as a [[sovereign state]] and claims Taiwan as part of its territory.

Under the terms of the [[One China Policy]] stipulated by the PRC, such countries may not have diplomatic relations with the Republic of China, as the PRC denies the status of ROC as a [[sovereign state]] and claims Taiwan as part of its territory. As a result, these countries do not allow the ROC to establish an \"official\" embassy or consulate but instead allow the ROC to establish these representative offices to conduct unofficial government relations with the host countries.\n\nExcept in the United States and Japan, these establishments use the term \"[[Taipei]]\" instead of \"[[Taiwan]]\", \"ROC\" or even the term \"Nationalist China\" (named after the ruling party [[Kuomintang]]) since the term \"Taipei\" avoids implying that Taiwan is a different country on a par with the PRC or that there are \"[[Two Chinas]]\", the PRC and the ROC, both of which would cause difficulties for their host countries.{{citation needed|reason=This whole paragraph needs a citation.|date=May 2018}}\n\nTECROs state that their aim is \"to promote bilateral trade, investment, culture, science and technology exchanges and cooperation, as well as better understanding\", although they perform many of the same functions as an [[embassy]] or [[consulate general]], such as issuing visas and [[Republic of China passport|passports]].
