Instead, the defendants admitted to their crimes because of the overwhelming evidence against them and because of their shame and guilt.{{sfn|Lukes|2008|p=1}} \n\nAfter the deaths of both Stalin and Gottwald in March 1953, the harshness of the persecutions slowly decreased, and the victims of the trial quietly received amnesty one by one, including those who had survived the Prague Trial. Later, the official historiography of the Communist Party was rather quiet on the trial, vaguely putting blame on errors that happened as a result of a \"[[cult of personality]]\". Many other political trials followed on, sending many innocent victims to jail and hard labour in [[J\u00e1chymov]] uranium mines and labour camps.<ref name=\"Margolius\"/>{{page needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe full transcript of the trial was released in 1953; Steiner described it as \"an utterly indigestible book, crammed with so many names, dates, and particulars that I had a hard time finishing it and remembering all the details.\"{{sfn|Steiner|2000b|p=663}}\n===International===\nThe Israeli government considered suppressing [[Maki (historical political party)|Maki]], the Israeli communist party, even to the point of throwing communist activists in concentration camps.

In Wein's opinion, because all of the defendants (except Simone) occupied high positions in the Czechoslovak Communist regime, they had [[command responsibility]] for crimes committed by it.{{sfn|Wein|2015|pp=158, 163}} Wein further noted that the three reprieved defendents all came from an upper-class background, while all of the middle-class and working-class defendants were executed. He hypothesizes that this was because if an upper-class person was a traitor to the Communist party, he was not a traitor to his class.{{sfn|Wein|2015|pp=163\u2013164}} According to [[Stephen Norwood]], the Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd trial was the \"clearest illustration yet of state-sponsored antisemitism in the Soviet bloc\" and \"a secularized version of the Spanish Inquisition\u2019s racialized antisemitism\", because it insisted on that Jewish origin was an indelible defect which would pass to all descendents (similar to the guilt of [[Jewish deicide]]).{{sfn|Norwood|2013|p=154}}\n\n== In popular culture ==\n[[File:Tisovec, Clementisovo n\u00e1m\u011bst\u00ed 01.jpg|thumb|Bust of Clementis in [[Tisovec]], Slovakia]]\nThe Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd trial was dramatised in the 1970 film ''[[The Confession (1970 film)|L'Aveu]]'' (\"The Confession\"), directed by [[Costa-Gavras]] and starring [[Yves Montand]] and [[Simone Signoret]].

This car is chassis #06R, also known as #29 [[Harrods]] Mach One Racing]]\n'''Group GT1''' also known simply as GT1, was a set of regulations maintained formerly by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA), for Grand Tourer racing. The category was first created in 1994, as the top class of the BPR Global GT Series, and was included in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. It fell under FIA regulation from 1997, after the BPR series came under the control of the FIA, becoming known as the FIA GT Championship. The category was dissolved at the end of 2011. The category may be split into 4 distinctive eras, from its debut in 1994\u20131996, 1997\u20131998, 2000\u20132009, 2010\u20132011.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Early years (1994-1996) ===\nIn 1994, following the collapse of the FIA World Sportscar Championship in 1992, BPR Global GT series was founded by J\u00fcrgen Barth, Patrick Peter, and Stephane Ratel (with their last names forming the name of series organizer BPR), as a championship for privateers, with 4 Hour Long Endurance Races.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.doubledeclutch.com/?tag=bpr-global-gt-series|title=BPR Global GT Series {{!}} DoubleDeClutch.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-01-06}}</ref> Barth, an ex Le Mans winner, was Manager of the Customer Competitions Department at Porsche, Peter was a well respected race promoter, while Ratel was an executive/investor in the Venturi GT1 project. The Series had 4 Categories, namely GT1-4, with each decreasing number signifying increased freedom in its technical regulations. By 1996 however, the championship had grown, with the grids of the championship growing due to an influx of cars from several makes in the top GT1 class, such as the McLaren F1 GTR, and the new Porsche 911 GT2 Evolution based on the new 993 chassis, which replaced the [[Porsche 964]] platform 911 Carrera RSRs that had once dominated the series grids. In addition, Professional teams had also begun to enter the championship that had once been intended for Privateers, which caused costs to increase dramatically.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.doubledeclutch.com/?tag=bpr-global-gt-series|title=BPR Global GT Series {{!}} DoubleDeClutch.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-01-06}}</ref> Porsche even sent in a Factory Team to several rounds, with its [[Porsche 911 GT1|911 GT1]], which was thought by most in the series paddock as being built against of the spirit of the rules, due to the fact that it was a Porsche 962 with just the front of the chassis being shared with a Type 993, 911, and it having a [[Porsche 911 GT1 Strasseversion|street variant]] simply for the sake of meeting its Homologation requirement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sportsracers.co.uk/gt.htm|title=BPR and FIA GT Series of the late 90s|website=www.sportsracers.co.uk|access-date=2019-01-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://drivemag.com/red-calipers/this-is-the-story-of-the-porsche-911-gt1|title=This is the story of the Porsche 911 GT1|last=Limited|first=Last Gear Publishing & Mobiventura|website=Drive Mag|access-date=2019-01-06}}</ref>\n\n=== Prototype Years (1997-1998) ===\n[[File:Porsche 911 GT1-96 front-left Porsche Museum.jpg|thumb|291x291px|[[Porsche 911 GT1|Porsche 911 GT1 (993)]] which would mark the beginning of the GT1 Prototype era]]\nFollowing the loss of Patrick Peter from the BPR Organisation, the BPR Organisation evolved into the [[St\u00e9phane Ratel Organisation|Stephane Ratel Organisation]], with the SRO now co-organising the championship with the FIA. With this change, it saw an even larger influx of professional teams and manufacturers, with the whole grid of the GT1 class consisting of nothing but professional teams.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sportsracers.co.uk/gt.htm|title=BPR and FIA GT Series of the late 90s|website=www.sportsracers.co.uk|access-date=2019-01-06}}</ref> The 1997 season saw the entry of the [[Mercedes-AMG]] Team, who would debut the [[Mercedes-Benz CLK GTR|CLK GTR]]. Similar to the 911 GT1, the CLK GTR was yet another homologation special prototype, with the car only being a racing-version of a production Grand Tourer in name. The car had no street legal version even built by the time the category collapsed in 1999,  and shared only the instrumentation, front grille and the four headlamps with the normal [[Mercedes-Benz CLK-Class|CLK C208]]. That same season, realising that the [[McLaren F1 GTR|F1 GTR]] would not be competitive against the homologation specials, McLaren also updated the bodywork of the car, with the alterations so significant that they were forced to build a road car with the updated bodywork, effectively turning the car into a homologation special. The resulting car was known as the F1 GT, with 3 being built.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.supercars.net/blog/1997-mclaren-f1-gt/|title=1997 McLaren F1 GT {{!}} Review|date=2016-04-18|website=Supercars.net|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-06}}</ref> In 1998, realising that with the introduction of the updated CLK LM, and the 911 GT1-98, the F1 GTR could no longer be competitive, McLaren withdrew backing from the program, following BMW which had done so the previous year, in 1997, although 2 cars would still be entered by Parabolica Motorsports and Davidoff Classic.  In 1999, following the total domination of the Mercedes-AMG team in the Championship in the previous season, which saw them win all races in the championship, with both the CLK GTR and LM, no GT1 teams entered the category, apart from the Mercedes-AMG Team. As such, the FIA chose to run the [[1999 FIA GT Championship]] with just the GT2 class.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.speedhunters.com/2018/08/the-clk-gtr-my-hero-car/|title=The CLK GTR: My Hero Car|date=2018-08-27|website=Speedhunters|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-08}}</ref>\n\n=== GTS \"GT1\" (2000-2009) ===\n[[File:Vitaphone MC12.jpg|thumb|283x283px|The [[Maserati MC12]] was the dominant car in the category from its full-season debut in 2006, clinching 3 drivers championships and 4 teams championships from 2006-2009. It would later earn the drivers and teams title in the [[2010 FIA GT1 World Championship]]]]\nFollowing the omission of the original GT1 category in the 1999 season, the FIA GT Championship was restructured, such that original GT2 class would be elevated to the top class of the championship, and become known as GT while a new class, [[Group NGT|N-GT]] would be the lower class in the championship. The equivalent of this in ACO sanctioned Championships would be the GTS class, and the GT class. In 2005, both classes would become renamed as \"GT1\" and \"[[LM GTE|GT2]]\" respectively. The Maserati MC12 would be the dominant car of this era, with it earning 5 consecutive teams titles from 2006-2009 for the [[Vitaphone Racing Team]] in the FIA GT Championship.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.autoblog.com/2009/11/05/report-nissan-gt-r-maserati-mc12-heading-to-le-mans/|title=REPORT: Nissan GT-R, Maserati MC12 heading to Le Mans|website=Autoblog|language=en|access-date=2019-01-06}}</ref>\n\n== List of FIA GT1 cars ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size=90%, border=1px\"\n|-\n|+ 1995\u20131998 Group GT1\n|-\n!

The category was first created in 1994, as the top class of the BPR Global GT Series, and was included in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. It fell under FIA regulation from 1997, after the BPR series came under the control of the FIA, becoming known as the FIA GT Championship. The category was dissolved at the end of 2011. The category may be split into 4 distinctive eras, from its debut in 1994\u20131996, 1997\u20131998, 2000\u20132009, 2010\u20132011.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Early years (1994-1996) ===\nIn 1994, following the collapse of the FIA World Sportscar Championship in 1992, BPR Global GT series was founded by J\u00fcrgen Barth, Patrick Peter, and Stephane Ratel (with their last names forming the name of series organizer BPR), as a championship for privateers, with 4 Hour Long Endurance Races.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.doubledeclutch.com/?tag=bpr-global-gt-series|title=BPR Global GT Series {{!}} DoubleDeClutch.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-01-06}}</ref> Barth, an ex Le Mans winner, was Manager of the Customer Competitions Department at Porsche, Peter was a well respected race promoter, while Ratel was an executive/investor in the Venturi GT1 project. The Series had 4 Categories, namely GT1-4, with each decreasing number signifying increased freedom in its technical regulations. By 1996 however, the championship had grown, with the grids of the championship growing due to an influx of cars from several makes in the top GT1 class, such as the McLaren F1 GTR, and the new Porsche 911 GT2 Evolution based on the new 993 chassis, which replaced the [[Porsche 964]] platform 911 Carrera RSRs that had once dominated the series grids. In addition, Professional teams had also began to enter the championship that had once been intended for Privateers, which caused costs to increase dramatically.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.doubledeclutch.com/?tag=bpr-global-gt-series|title=BPR Global GT Series {{!}} DoubleDeClutch.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-01-06}}</ref> Porsche even sent in a Factory Team to several rounds, with its [[Porsche 911 GT1|911 GT1]], which was thought by most in the series paddock as being built against of the spirit of the rules, due to the fact that it was a Porsche 962 with just the front of the chassis being shared with a Type 993, 911, and it having a [[Porsche 911 GT1 Strasseversion|street variant]] simply for the sake of meeting its Homologation requirement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sportsracers.co.uk/gt.htm|title=BPR and FIA GT Series of the late 90s|website=www.sportsracers.co.uk|access-date=2019-01-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://drivemag.com/red-calipers/this-is-the-story-of-the-porsche-911-gt1|title=This is the story of the Porsche 911 GT1|last=Limited|first=Last Gear Publishing & Mobiventura|website=Drive Mag|access-date=2019-01-06}}</ref>\n\n=== Prototype Years (1997-1998) ===\n[[File:Porsche 911 GT1-96 front-left Porsche Museum.jpg|thumb|291x291px|[[Porsche 911 GT1|Porsche 911 GT1 (993)]] which would mark the beginning of the GT1 Prototype era]]\nFollowing the loss of Patrick Peter from the BPR Organisation, the BPR Organisation evolved into the [[St\u00e9phane Ratel Organisation|Stephane Ratel Organisation]], with the SRO now co-organising the championship with the FIA. With this change, it saw an even larger influx of professional teams and manufacturers, with the whole grid of the GT1 class consisting of nothing but professional teams. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sportsracers.co.uk/gt.htm|title=BPR and FIA GT Series of the late 90s|website=www.sportsracers.co.uk|access-date=2019-01-06}}</ref> The 1997 season saw the entry of the [[Mercedes-AMG]] Team, who would debut the [[Mercedes-Benz CLK GTR|CLK GTR]]. Similar to the 911 GT1, the CLK GTR was yet another homologation special prototype, with the car only being a racing-version of a production Grand Tourer in name. The car had no street legal version even built by the time the category collapsed in 1999,  and shared only the instrumentation, front grille and the four headlamps with the normal [[Mercedes-Benz CLK-Class|CLK C208]]. That same season, realising that the [[McLaren F1 GTR|F1 GTR]] would not be competitive against the homologation specials, McLaren also updated the bodywork of the car, with the alterations so significant that they were forced to build a road car with the updated bodywork, effectively turning the car into a homologation special. The resulting car was known as the F1 GT, with 3 being built.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.supercars.net/blog/1997-mclaren-f1-gt/|title=1997 McLaren F1 GT {{!}} Review|date=2016-04-18|website=Supercars.net|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-06}}</ref> In 1998, realising that with the introduction of the updated CLK LM, and the 911 GT1-98, the F1 GTR could no longer be competitive, McLaren withdrew backing from the program, following BMW which had done so the previous year, in 1997, although 2 cars would still be entered by Parabolica Motorsports and Davidoff Classic.  In 1999, following the total domination of the Mercedes-AMG team in the Championship in the previous season, which saw them win all races in the championship, with both the CLK GTR and LM, no GT1 teams entered the category, apart from the Mercedes-AMG Team. As such, the FIA chose to run the [[1999 FIA GT Championship]] with just the GT2 class.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.speedhunters.com/2018/08/the-clk-gtr-my-hero-car/|title=The CLK GTR: My Hero Car|date=2018-08-27|website=Speedhunters|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-08}}</ref>\n\n=== GTS \"GT1\" (2000-2009) ===\n[[File:Vitaphone MC12.jpg|thumb|283x283px|The [[Maserati MC12]] was the dominant car in the category from its full-season debut in 2006, clinching 3 drivers championships and 4 teams championships from 2006-2009. It would later earn the drivers and teams title in the [[2010 FIA GT1 World Championship]]]]\nFollowing the omission of the original GT1 category in the 1999 season, the FIA GT Championship was restructured, such that original GT2 class would be elevated to the top class of the championship, and become known as GT while a new class, [[Group NGT|N-GT]] would be the lower class in the championship. The equivalent of this in ACO sanctioned Championships would be the GTS class, and the GT class. In 2005, both classes would become renamed as \"GT1\" and \"[[LM GTE|GT2]]\" respectively. The Maserati MC12 would be the dominant car of this era, with it earning 5 consecutive teams titles from 2006-2009 for the [[Vitaphone Racing Team]] in the FIA GT Championship. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.autoblog.com/2009/11/05/report-nissan-gt-r-maserati-mc12-heading-to-le-mans/|title=REPORT: Nissan GT-R, Maserati MC12 heading to Le Mans|website=Autoblog|language=en|access-date=2019-01-06}}</ref> \n\n== List of FIA GT1 cars ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size=90%, border=1px\"\n|-\n|+ 1995\u20131998 Group GT1\n|-\n!

The shrine was built in three main phases; in the late 8th and 9th centuries, and in the 14th and 15th centuries.<ref name=\"m294\">Moss (2014), p. 214</ref> It is thus considered a mixture of the early [[Insular art]] and later [[International Gothic]] styles.\n\nA redesign c. 1350 added most of the extant frontpiece metalwork and [[relief]] plaques. Today the Domhnach Airgid comprises two separate main elements: an outer casket or box and an wooden box or container for [[relics]]; originally it held fragments of a 6th-9th century manuscript. The oblong box is heavily inscribed with lettering which along its outer borders, and is covered by silver and bronze panels which contain fragments of a [[vellum]] manuscript of the [[Gospels]] written in Latin.<ref name=\"Cornhill\">\"The Study of Celtic Literature\". ''The Cornhill magazine''.

Retrieved 21 February 2020</ref>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Domhnach Airgid Detail.pg.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Domhnach Airgid, detail]]\nDue to its age, the Domhnach Airgid is in poor condition. Areas of the gilding contain accumulations of dirt, and any colourisation has long since faded, giving it its current dark appearance of mostly brown and black hues.<ref name=\"oc12\" />\n\nThe shrine was originally built in the 8th century, but little is visible from before a major reworking around 1350 by the abbot of [[Clones, County Monaghan|Clones]]. What does remain from the original consists of tinned [[List of copper alloys|copper alloy]] plates positioned on two sides and on the top of the shrine, which are thought to have given it its name (''Silver Church''). These plates are decorated with cut in [[Interlace (art)|interlace]] designs, which have been dated to the late eight or early ninth centuries.<ref name=\"m294\" />\n\nA fully three-dimensional figure of Christ crucified is at the centre of the main face, with [[relief]] plaques of saints and the Virgin and Child, and other scenes on the sides which combine principal figures in relief and others in [[engraving]].<ref name=\"w261-2\">Wallace; O'Floinn (2002), pp. 261\u2013262, 270</ref> The style is rather more sophisticated than in some 14th century reworkings, with elegant running animals or [[grotesques]] placed on small mounts at the corners.<ref name=\"w261-2\" /> A dove, representing the [[Holy Spirit]] and decorated with a crystal, hovers above Christ's head.<ref name=\"oc323\">O'Curry (1878), p. 323</ref> \n\n[[File:Domhnach Airgid Crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|Domhnach Airgid, detail]]\n\nThere eleven smaller sized figures around Jesus, all ornately and delicately carved. They include a grouping of three [[apostles]], probably James, Peter and Paul, the panel showing the [[Archangel Michael]] and the Virgin and Child, a panel with a grouping of [[Saint Colmcille]], [[St. Brigid]] and Patrick, while with the saint at the lower right is thought to represent of Patrick presenting a cumdach to [[Mac Cairthinn of Clogher|St. Macartan]].<ref>\"[http://irisharchaeology.ie/2015/02/the-domhnach-airgid-an-early-irish-book-shrine/ The Domhnach Airgid, an Early Irish Book Shrine]\".

In this tradition, the shrine was thought to have been in his possession and was sanctified by him<ref name=\"oc12\">O'Curry (1861), p. 12</ref> before he gave it to St. Macartan. The shrine thus became a significant and prized object that was widely venerated.<ref name=\"ot98\">O'Toole (2013), p. 98</ref>\n\nIt consists of three covers, with the center one being made of wood, probably from [[yew]]. Another is made from copper, plated with silver. The outer cover, pictured above, is of the highest quality, and lined with silver and decorated by [[gilding]].<ref name=\"oc322\">O'Curry (1878), p. 322</ref>\n\n==History==\n<div style=\"margin-right: -1em\">\n{{Quote box|border=1px|align=right|title=\n|quote=<poem style=\"margin-left: 4px; margin-bottom: -1.5em; margin-top: -1.5em\">\n\nAnd the Saint then left Bishop Mac Carthainn there, at Clogher,\nand bestowed the Domhnach Airgid upon him,\nwhich had been given to Patrick from heaven,\nwhen he was on the sea, coming to Erin.</poem>\n<br>\n|salign=right|source=Matthew Arnold, \"Celtic Literature\", 1891<ref>Arnold (1891)</ref>}}\n</div>\nThe case was significantly remodeled around 1350 (a dating established by [[George Petrie (artist)|George Petrie]]) by the goldsmith John O\u2019Bardan, during work commissioned by John O\u2019Carbri, [[Clones Abbey|abbot of Clones]]. O\u2019Bardan, whose signature appears on the object and is known to have lived in [[Drogheda]], modernised the appearance of the shrine in the contemporary [[International Gothic]] style,<ref name=\"ot98\" /><ref name=\"h510\">Hourihane (2012), p. 510</ref> and added the figures of Jesus and the saints.<ref name=\"ot98\" /> O\u2019Carbri likely had political motivations for commissioning the redesign in the context of the [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland]].

What does remain from the original consists of tinned [[List of copper alloys|copper alloy]] plates positioned on two sides and on the top of the shrine, which are thought to have given it its name (''Silver Church''). These plates are decorated with cut in [[interlace]] designs, which have been dated to the late eight or early ninth centuries.<ref name=\"m294\" />\n\nA fully three-dimensional figure of Christ crucified is at the centre of the main face, with [[relief]] plaques of saints and the Virgin and Child, and other scenes on the sides which combine principal figures in relief and others in [[engraving]].<ref name=\"w261-2\">Wallace; O'Floinn (2002), pp. 261\u2013262, 270</ref> The style is rather more sophisticated than in some 14th century reworkings, with elegant running animals or [[grotesques]] placed on small mounts at the corners.<ref name=\"w261-2\" /> A dove, representing the [[Holy Spirit]] and decorated with a crystal, hovers above Christ's head.<ref name=\"oc323\">O'Curry (1878), p. 323</ref> \n\n[[File:Domhnach Airgid Crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|Domhnach Airgid, detail]]\n\nThere eleven smaller sized figures around Jesus, all ornately and delicately carved.

{"title_page": "Constitution of Florida", "text_new": "\n\n| writer= \n| signers=\n| purpose=\n| number_amendments=\n}}\n{{Politics of Florida}}\nThe '''Constitution of the State of Florida''' is the document that establishes and describes the powers, duties, structure and function of the government of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Florida]], and establishes the basic law of the state. The current [[State constitution (United States)|Constitution]] of Florida was ratified on November 5, 1968.\n\nFlorida has been governed by six different constitutions since acceding to the United States. Before 1838, only the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]] was briefly enacted in Florida. A monument commemorating ''[[Spanish Constitution of 1812|La Constituci\u00f3n de C\u00e1diz]]'' still stands in front of the [[Government House (St. Augustine)|Government House]] in [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]].\n\nFlorida's first constitution as a U.S. territory was written and implemented in 1838. On March 3, 1845, Florida was granted admission into the Union as the 27th state. The current Constitution of Florida was ratified on November 5, 1968, and has been modified by initiative and referendum several times since.\n\n== Constitution ==\n\n==='''The Florida Constitutional Convention'''===\nSee also [[Florida Constitutional Convention of 1838]]\n\nOne of the requirements for a [[United States territory]] to become a state of the union is that its constitution must be approved by the [[United     States Congress]]. In order to fulfill that requirement, an act was passed by the [[Florida Territorial Council]] in 1838, approved by Governor [[Richard Keith Call]], calling for the election of [[Delegate (American politics)|delegate]]s in October 1838 to a [[Political convention|convention]] to be held at [[St. Joseph, Gulf County, Florida|St. Joseph, Florida]]. The delegates were to draft a constitution and [[bill of rights]] for the Territory of Florida. The Constitutional Convention convened on December 3, 1838, with [[Robert R. Reid]] presiding as president and Joshua Knowles secretary. The work of the Convention was carried out by eighteen committees, whose members were familiar with that particular area of government. The process was a relatively simple one since they used the constitutions of several other Southern states as models. Only on the subject of banking did much debate take place. The Convention adjourned ''[[sine die]]'' on January 11, 1839.\n\nA handwritten copy of the 1838 Constitution or \"Form of Government for the People of Florida,\" signed by Convention President Robert Raymond Reid and Convention Secretary Joshua Knowles, resides at the State Archives of Florida. Considered \"a secretary's copy\" this document is the only known copy of the 1838 Constitution. The original Constitution, signed by all the delegates, has never been found.<ref>[http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?Mode=Constitution&Submenu=3&Tab=statutes/ FL Constitution]</ref> The preamble to the Constitution of 1838:<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.law.fsu.edu/crc/conhist/1838con.html |title=FSU Florida Constitution Revision Commission |access-date=2014-01-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111030001703/http://www.law.fsu.edu/crc/conhist/1838con.html |archive-date=2011-10-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n{{quote|We, the People of the Territory of Florida, by our Delegates in Convention, assembled at the City of St. Joseph, on Monday the 3d day of December, A.D. 1838, and of the Independence of the United States the sixty-third year, having and claiming the right of admission into the Union, as one of the United States of America, consistent with the principles of the Federal Constitution, and by virtue of the Treaty of Amity, Settlement, and Limits between the United States of America and the King of Spain, ceding the Provinces of East and West Florida to the United States; in order to secure to ourselves and our posterity the enjoyment of all the rights of life, liberty, and property, and the pursuit of happiness, do mutually agree, each with the other, to form ourselves into a Free and Independent State, by the name of the State of Florida.}}\n\n===Ordinance of Secession and the 1861 Constitution of Florida===\nIn 1860, the onrush of the [[American Civil War]] brought the election in Florida of a convention \"for the purpose of taking into consideration the position of this State in the Federal Union.\" Pursuant to an Act of the Legislature approved November 30, 1860, governor [[Madison S. Perry]] issued a proclamation calling an election on Saturday, December 22, 1860, for delegates to a Convention to address the issue of whether Florida had a right to withdraw from the Union. The Secession Convention met on January 3, 1861, in [[Tallahassee]], and produced for adoption on January 10 an Ordinance of Secession and a Constitution which largely altered the existing Constitution.  \n\nSome changes related directly to Florida's secession, such as substituting \"Confederate States\" for \"United States,\" removing the requirement that the governor be a citizen for the United States for ten years prior to his election, and declaring Florida to be \"a sovereign and independent nation.\" The governor's term was changed from four years to two years starting October 1865, an election never realized due to the Confederacy's defeat.  The 1861 Constitution also added several sections affecting the power of General Assembly of Florida, such as limiting the duration of sessions, allowing it to license toll bridges and pass general laws for name changes, prohibiting it from allowing married women or minors to contract or manage their estates, and prohibiting it from legitimizing bastards.  The General Assembly was also allowed to tax the lands and slaves of non-residents higher than residents and create special tribunals to try offenses committed by slaves, freemen, and mulattoes.  Public lands previously ceded to the United States government were deemed reclaimed by Florida but were to be used exclusively for paying the State's debts and necessary expenses, and such lands could not be granted for any other purpose.  Prohibitions on certain bankers and certain previous office holders from being elected until the expiration of a year from having left their prior position were removed. The 1861 Constitution was the first Florida Constitution to contain a clause prohibiting individuals from holding two offices simultaneously with limited exceptions.  No citizen of any of the States or Territories of the United States then at war with the Confederate States could be admitted to Florida citizenship, be eligible to vote or be elected, hold property, or work in the State of Florida.  The articles pertaining to the militia and corporations were largely reworded.  The General Assembly lost the ability to amend the Constitution, leaving a State convention as the only method of amendment.  The prohibition on the General Assembly forbidding emigrants to the State from bringing their slaves with them was repealed.  The article pertaining to the seat of government was removed.  Other changes included removing obsolete language stemming from Florida's creation as a State and codifying legislation enacted since Florida attained statehood.\n\nJohn C. McGehee of Madison County was elected president of the Convention, and the Convention ratified the Constitution adopted by the Confederate States of America on April 13 and [[Adjournment sine die|adjourned sine die]] on April 27, 1861.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nSince the Convention generally approved of Governor Perry's actions it made no move to interfere with his administration. However, when Governor John Milton took office in October 1861 and reversed some policies of his predecessor, a movement was started to reconvene the Convention. Convention president McGehee issued a proclamation on December 13 for the convention to meet on '''January 14, 1862''', at Tallahassee. McGehee expressed concern over two matters: the state's finances and the powers of the governor during wartime. To remedy the latter, the members appointed an Executive Council of four men to share the executive authority because they felt that the powers of a wartime executive should not be placed in the hands of one man. The Convention adjourned sine die on January 27, 1862.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n===The 1865 Florida Constitution (not approved)===\nIn October 1865, delegates met to revoke the Ordinance of Secession and write a new Constitution. This Constitution, since it limited [[suffrage]] to white male citizens, did not meet the requirements of [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] for seating delegates from the former Confederate states, and it was scrapped in favor of the Constitution of 1868.<ref>https://www.floridamemory.com/items/show/189093, retrieved April 21, 2016.</ref>\n\n===The 1868 Florida Constitution===<!-- This section heading is linked from [[Seminole Wars]] -->\nThe [[Reconstruction Era]] constitution returned civilian control of the state after Florida became subject to the military authority of the federal government in 1867. Pursuant to an Act of Congress, General [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]], Commander of the [[Third Military District]], issued an order on April 8, 1867, dividing the 39 counties of the State into 19 districts for the election of delegates to a convention to frame a new State Constitution. The new constitution had to conform with the [[United States Constitution|Federal Constitution]], including [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|the 13th]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendments]]. \n\nThe Convention met in [[Tallahassee]] on January 20, 1868. As deliberations got under way, bitterly divided factions were formed. Of the 46 elected delegates, 18 were black and at least 15 were former slaves, who were described as literate, \"gentlemen\", and \"eloquent\" by a Northern reporter who was present.<ref>{{cite article\n|last=Richardson\n|first=Joe\n|journal=[[Florida Historical Quarterly]]\n|title=A Northerner Reports on Florida\n|volume=40\n|date=April 1962\n|page=383}}</ref> According to historian Adam Wasserman, \"The radical delegates were in the vast majority and backed by a large militant black electorate.\"<ref name=Peoples>{{cite book\n|title=A People's History of Florida\n|edition=4th\n|first=Adam\n|last=Wasserman\n|year=2010\n|publisher=Adam Wasserman\n|isbn=9781442167094\n|page=527}}</ref> The \"moderates\" were \"a powerful organized lobby of Southern planters, Northern capitalists, and capitalists\".<ref name=Peoples />{{rp|529}} \n\nFor two weeks, the \"radical\" and \"moderate\" factions  debated. Under the leadership of future governor [[Harrison Reed (politician)|Harrison Reed]], the \"moderates\" tried to give the sparsely-populated white counties the same voting power as the heavily-populated black counties. The \"radicals\", however, would not agree to such an arrangement.\n\nSeeing no chance of victory, 19 of the \"moderate\" delegates decamped to nearby [[Monticello, Florida]].<ref name=Peoples />{{rp|529}} The \"radical\" majority proceeded to craft \"the initial and legitimate constitution\", signed it, and then adjourned for a week to hear back from the [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] military commander, General [[George Meade]]. On February 10, the 21 \"moderate\" delegates, with the aid of Democratic governor and ex-Confederate general [[David S. Walker]], broke into the hall at midnight. To ensure a [[quorum]], soldiers seized two of the \"radical\" delegates (who were in bed), and forced them to the hall. Between midnight and 2 AM, the \"moderates\" drafted a new constitution, \"protected by a guard of Federal soldiers outside the hall\". When the day came for the legal convention to meet again, soldiers with bayonets prevented the \"radicals\" from entering the hall.\n\nThe two constitutions were both submitted to General Meade; the Committee on Reconstruction subsequently adopted the \"moderate\" one, on Meade's recommendation. Under its terms for [[reapportionment]], less than one-fourth of voters would be able to elect a majority of the State Senate, and less than one-third could elect a majority of the Assembly. As stated in a letter to Senator [[David Yulee]], \"Under our Constitution the Judiciary & State officers will be appointed & the apportionment will prevent a negro legislature.\" [[Freedmen's Bureau]] agent [[William J. Furman]] later bragged that he had prevented Florida from being \"niggerized\".<ref name=Peoples />{{rp|531}}\n\nThe Constitution was adopted by the people of Florida in May 1868. It conferred the [[Suffrage|electoral franchise]] upon \"male persons\" instead of \"white male persons\", as in the 1865 Constitution. With its acceptance by the Federal military authorities, the State of Florida was recognized as being restored to the Union, and its senators and representatives were admitted to Congress.\n\nThis constitution stated that one seat in the House of Representatives and one in the Senate were to be allocated to the [[Seminole Indians]]; the seats were to be filled by a member of their tribe \"and in no case by a white man.\"<ref>[http://www.floridamemory.com/items/show/189095?id=29 Florida Constitution of 1868, Art. XVI, Section VII]</ref>  However, these positions were never filled, and this provision was not carried over into subsequent constitutions.\n\n===The 1885 Florida Constitution===\n{{Main|Florida Constitution of 1885}}\nThe [[Florida Constitutional Convention of 1885]] produced a constitution that reversed some of the aspects of the 1868 Constitution by establishing a poll tax to further disenfranchise African Americans. It also codified segregation. It established the makeup of the state government that continued until 1968.\n\nThe 1885 Legislature enacted Chapter 3577 calling for a Constitutional Convention in order to revise the Constitution of 1868. In May 1885 a general election for the selection of delegates was held throughout the state. The Convention met in Tallahassee from June 9 to August 3, 1885. [[Samuel Pasco]] of [[Jefferson County, Florida|Jefferson County]] presided. Pursuant to Ordinance No. 1 of the Convention, the Constitution was submitted to the citizens of Florida for ratification in November 1886. The 1885 Constitution was ratified by a 31,803 to 21,243 vote.\n\nThe new constitution legitimized a [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] as a prerequisite for voting (Article VI, Section 8), thus effectively causing disfranchisement of blacks and many poor whites. By 1888, voter turnout had decreased by 27%, and additional provisions were adopted that further suppressed voters registration and turnout.<ref>[http://www.jimcrowhistory.org/history/creating2.htm The History of Jim Crow] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070601223741/http://www.jimcrowhistory.org/history/creating2.htm |date=June 1, 2007 }}</ref> This constitution mandated racial segregation in schools (Article XII, Section 12), and prohibited marriage between \"a white person and a person of negro descent\" (Article XVI, Section 24).\n\n===The 1968 Florida Constitution===\nThe current Florida Constitution of 1968 was proposed on June 24-July 3 of 1968 via three joint resolutions in special sessions of the Florida Legislature. House Joint Resolution 1-2X included all revisions except for Article V, Article VI, and Article VIII. Senate Resolution 4-2X proposed the new Article VI which relates to elections and suffrage. Senate Resolution 5-2X proposed a new Article VIII which defined law regarding local government. Article V was included from the 1885 constitution as amended. [[Chesterfield Smith]] was the chair of the committee which drafted the Constitution; [[LeRoy Collins]] was also on the committee.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThe constitution was ratified via referendum by the electorate on November 5, 1968.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThe political context of this new Constitution was that it was a necessary step toward fair apportionment of legislative districts, required by the [[US Supreme Court]] in various decisions in the 1960s. Many states, including Florida. had allotted a fixed number of senators per county, regardless of population, since the republic began. This violated the new federal court decisions. The regular political process had failed to remedy this.

The change became effective January 7, 2003, and the Florida Cabinet now consists of the attorney general, the chief financial officer and the commissioner of agriculture. The secretary of state and commissioner of education became appointed positions and their respective agencies became the responsibility of the governor. The revised constitution also created a new State Board of Education with seven members appointed by the governor to oversee the Department of Education.

Reed, Jr.]]\n* [[John L. Ryals]]\n* [[Robert L. Shevin]]\n* [[John T. Ware]]\n\nThe outcome of the commission was placing, for voter consideration and approval, eight potential constitutional amendments on the Florida ballot. None of them were passed.<ref>{{cite web |title=Constitution Revision Commission |url=https://www.flcrc.gov/about/history |accessdate=28 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==  Current Florida Constitution ==\n\nArticle V of the Florida Constitution, relating to the Judicial Branch, was not included in the 1968 revision. Not until 1971 in a special session did the Legislature pass Senate Joint Resolution 52-D proposing to the voters the \"modern\" Article V.<ref name=\"Article V\">The 1971 proposed rewrite of Article V was approved by the voters in 1972. It established uniform courts throughout Florida, set the jurisdiction of the courts, required that all judges be full time, established the judicial nominating commission, and revised the judicial qualifications commission.</ref>\n\n===Article I:  \"Declaration of Rights\"===\nThe first article of the Florida Constitution contains the state's bill of rights which is very similar to the [[United States Bill of Rights]] except that there are more elaborations very similar to interpretations of the Bill of Rights by the United States Supreme Court, such as a clause stating that the freedom of religion cannot be used to justify immoral acts.  Florida's Declaration of Rights also states that capital punishment is not unconstitutional. Search and seizure and cruel and unusual punishment protections are to be consistent with the United States Supreme Court's interpretation of those rights.\n\n===Article II: \"General Provisions\"===\nThe Florida constitution provides for an executive, legislative, and judicial branch. Unlike the U.S. Constitution, it mandates a separation of powers. The Florida Supreme Court has interpreted the \"separation of powers\" requirement to prohibit both encroachment by any one branch on the powers held by another and delegation by any branch of its powers.\n\nSection one denotes the official state boundaries.\n\nSection two denotes basic rights.\n\nSection three prescribes for separation of powers.\n\nSection seven mandates that those living in the Everglades Protection Area, who cause water pollution, will be primarily responsible for its remediation.\n\nSection nine mandates that English is the official language of the state.\n\n\n===Article III: \"Legislature\"===\nArticle III requires that the Florida Legislature be a bicameral body, with an upper house of not more than 40 members elected to four-year terms, and a lower house of not more 120 members elected to two-year terms.\n\nSections 10 and 11 discuss special laws (those affecting portions of the state, not the entire) and prohibitions against it.\n\nSection six discusses the \"single subject requirement\" limitation on laws.\n\nSections 20 and 21 set standards for drawing congressional and legislative districts.\n\n===Article IV: \"Executive\"===\nArticle IV governs the election of the Florida governor and lieutenant governor, and of the Florida Cabinet. It currently specifies that the cabinet will consist of an attorney general, a chief financial officer, and a commissioner of agriculture with specifically defined powers, and it designates them as elected rather than appointed.\n\n===Article V: \"Judiciary\"===\nArticle V establishes the [[Florida Supreme Court]] and the Florida District Courts of Appeal, as well as circuit and county courts, describes how they are to be appointed, and sets forth their jurisdiction.  It has been amended a number of times since ratification of the 1968 Constitution.  Most notably, the voters approved extensive amendments in 1972 to create a unified state courts system, placing all lower courts under the administrative supervision of Florida's chief justice.  This change required the creation of a new Florida Office of the State Courts Administrator, which assists the chief justice.  The 1972 amendments further reduced the different kinds of courts that existed in Florida from ten to four and made this system uniform throughout the state for the first time in Florida history.  An amendment ratified in 1976 ended contested elections for Florida's appellate judges and made them subject to merit retention votes under a modified [[Missouri Plan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/pub_info/system2.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705081802/http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/pub_info/system2.shtml |archivedate=2010-07-05 }}</ref>\n\n===Article VI: \"Suffrage and Elections\"===\nDiscusses the requirements for voters and when voting rights are disqualified.\n\nSection 4(b) places eight-year term limits on all legislative and executive office holders.  (The section also places limits on Congressional officeholders; however, these provisions were ruled unconstitutional elsewhere and thus have no effect.)\n\n===Article VII : \"Finance and Taxation\"===\nArticle VII specifically prohibits the levying of an income tax, except via very strict limitations.\n\nThe article further delineates the purposes for which bonds can be issued, and requires that certain bonds be approved by the voters in the affected area.\n\n===Article VIII: \"Local Government\"===\nArticle VIII covers municipal and county government, and distinguishes between charter counties and non-charter counties. Two key distinctions are set forth therein:\n\n# Counties may enact any ordinance that is not inconsistent with general or special state law.  In charter counties, a governing special law can be one passed by the county's voters, provided it is not inconsistent with general state law.  In non-charter counties, a governing special law must be one passed by the state legislature.\n# Municipal ordinances override inconsistent ordinances passed by non-charter counties; for chartered counties, the charter itself will determine which ordinance governs when there is a conflict.\n\nSection 1 of this Article also establishes the following elected county officers for terms of four years<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?Mode=Constitution&Submenu=3&Tab=statutes#A8S01|title=Art VIII, 1(d), Fla.

Extracurricular classes are specifically exempt.\n\nSection 1(b) also mandates a voluntary PK-4 program in all public schools.\n\nUnder Section 4, each county is a separate school district, though contiguous counties may combine into one school district upon voter approval.\n\nSection 5 requires that the county school superintendent is elected by the voters unless legislation has been passed which allows the individual to be employed by the school board.\n\nSection 7 discusses the Florida State University System and its bi-level governing structure.\n\nThe overall system is governed by a 17-member Board of Governors, of which 14 members are appointed by the [[governor of Florida]] with the consent of the [[Florida Senate]] and serve staggered seven-year terms.  The remaining three members consist of the Florida Commissioner of Education, the chair of the advisory council of faculty senates (or the equivalent), and the president of the Florida Student Association.\n\nIn addition, each university is governed by a 13-member Board of Trustees, of which six members are appointed by the governor and five members appointed by the Board of Governors, with the consent of the Florida Senate and serve staggered five-year terms.  The remaining two members consist of the chair of the university's faculty senate and the president of the university's student body.\n\n===Article X: \"Miscellaneous\"===\nIncludes various provisions.\n\nSection 4 lays out Florida's homestead exemption provision, considered one of the most protective in the nation for resident property owners.  The provision exempts from forced sale (except [[tax sale|to pay taxes]], [[mortgage]]s, or [[mechanic's lien]]) 160 acres of contiguous land plus all improvements (if located outside a municipality) or 1/2 acre of contiguous land plus all improvements (if located inside a municipality), regardless of the property's value, plus personal property up to US$1,000.  Upon the owner's death, the exemptions extend to the surviving spouse or to the heirs.\n\nSection 6c, resulting from the ''[[Kelo v. City of New London]]'' decision, prohibits the conveyance of property taken by eminent domain to another person or private entity without 3/5ths approval of both houses of the [[Florida Legislature]].\n\nThis article contains sections both prohibiting lotteries (Section 7) and simultaneously [[Florida Lottery|allowing them]] (Section 15).\n\nSection 16 discusses about the limitations on marine net fishing.\n\nSection 20 contains the constitution prohibition against smoking in all indoor workplaces.\n\nSection 21 contains a prohibition \"[l]imiting cruel and inhumane confinement of [[pig]]s during pregnancy\".\n\nSection 22 requires parental notification prior to a minor obtaining an [[abortion]].\n\nSection 24 specifies the state [[minimum wage]].  Unlike the Federal and other state minimum wage laws, this section contains an annual index to adjust the wage for inflation (the wage is adjusted effective January 1 of each year).\n\nSection 25, re-enacted as \"Amendment 7,\" regards a patient's right to discover records related to adverse medical incidents\n\nSection 26 required the automatic revocation of any medical license where the provider has committed three or more incidents of medical malpractice.\n\n===Article XI: \"Amendments\"===\nThe method of \"compilation\" for the Florida Constitution is unlike that of the federal constitution. When the Florida Constitution is amended the official text of the document is edited, removing language that is no longer in force. The Division of Statutory Revision within the Office of Legislative Services is responsible for codifying new amendments and removing obsolete language.<ref>[http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0000-0099/0011/Sections/0011.242.html \u00a7 11.242, Fla. Stat. (2016)]</ref>\n\nHowever, the constitution usually includes history notes appended to the sections indicating when parts of it were amended, except that sections which were a part of the 1968 revision do not contain history notes prior to 1968.  The section, indexes, headings, and notes are considered editorial features and not part of the Constitution per se, and thus do not convey any rights.\n\n====Proposing amendments====\nThe Florida Constitution provides five methods for proposing amendments:\n* By the [[Florida Legislature]], with a three-fifths vote of the membership of both houses.\n* By the Constitution Revision Commission, which is established every 20 years to consider and propose amendments (the Commission first met in 1977 and again in 1997; the next scheduled meeting is in 2037).<ref>[http://www.law.fsu.edu/crc/ Florida Constitutional Revision Commission website: Our Purpose]</ref> The Commission consists of 37 members: the [[Florida Attorney General|Florida attorney general]], 15 members selected by the [[governor of Florida]] (who also designates the chair), nine members selected by the speaker of the [[Florida House of Representatives]], nine members selected by the president of the [[Florida Senate]], and three members selected by the chief justice of the [[Florida Supreme Court]] with the advice of the other justices.\n* By the Taxation and Budget Reform Commission, which is established every 20 years to consider and propose amendments (the Commission first met in 2007; the next scheduled meeting is in 2027). The Commission consists of 25 members: 11 members selected by the governor, seven members selected by the Speaker of the Florida House, and seven members selected by the Leader of the Florida Senate; however, none of the members can be a member of the Legislature at the time of selection).  In addition, the Commission has four [[ex officio]] members who are members of the Legislature: two selected by the House Speaker and two by the Senate President; both the Speaker and President must select one of its ex officio members from the minority party.\n* By a constitutional convention, which is called by the simple majority approval of a [[initiative|voter initiative]] asking for a convention.\n* By voter initiative, as a proposed amendment to appear on the ballot. By law, any such amendment 1) is limited to a single subject, 2) must include a ballot title not to exceed 15 words in length, 3) must also include a ballot summary not to exceed 75 words in length, and 4) must further include a financial impact statement not to exceed 75 words in length.\n\n====Amendment approval====\nExcept as noted below, all amendments proposed, regardless of the method of proposal, must be approved by 60 percent of the voters in a referendum held simultaneously with the next general election (that is, the next one at least 90 days after the amendment is filed with the custodian of state records) before they become a part of the Constitution. Previously, the ballot initiatives required only a simple majority (more than 50%) to be approved. A 2006 amendment raised the required threshold to a supermajority (60%).\n\nAmendments involving the creation of \"new State taxes or fees\" require a two-thirds approval of the voters.\n\nThe Legislature, via a three-fourths majority, may pass a law calling for a special election date on any amendment (again, which must be 90 days after the amendment is filed with the custodian of state records).\n\n====Notable amendments====\nMany diverse, and sometimes controversial, amendments have been proposed to the Florida Constitution over the years. From modifications to the amendment process itself to parental notification of a minor's intent to terminate a pregnancy, to minimum wage increases, to limiting cruel and inhumane confinement of pigs during pregnancy.\n\n=====Right to privacy=====\n{{see also|Right to privacy#United States|Privacy laws of the United States}}\nArticle I, Section 23 of the Florida Constitution provides:<ref>{{cite web|title=The Florida Constitution|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?submenu=3#A2|website=Online Sunshine|publisher=The Florida Legislature|accessdate=15 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|'''Right of privacy.''' \u2014 Every natural person has the right to be let alone and free from governmental intrusion into the person's private life except as otherwise provided herein.

It was put to the electorate by the Commission as part of a package of provisions in a single amendment, which failed. In 1980, the Florida Legislature, believing there was significant public interest in this provision, passed a resolution placing the provision as a single amendment on the 1980 general election that was approved by voters, becoming a part of the Florida Constitution.<ref name=\"Overton-Giddings 1997\">{{cite journal |last1=Overton |first1=Ben F. |last2=Giddings |first2=Katherine E. |date=1997 |title=The Right of Privacy in Florida in the Age of Technology and the Twenty-First Century: A Need for Protection from Private and Commercial Intrusion |journal=Florida State University Law Review |volume=25 |issue= |pages=25\u201355 |url=http://ir.law.fsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1394&context=lr |access-date=15 July 2017 }}</ref>{{Rp|25, 34\u201335}}\n\nThe provision extends to the private lives of all natural persons, including minors, but only protects them from intrusion by ''government'', not private individuals or corporations.<ref name=\"Overton-Giddings 1997\"/>{{Rp|26, 35\u201336}} It affords more protection than [[Privacy laws of the United States#Federal|the right to privacy under the Federal Constitution]].<ref name=\"Overton-Giddings 1997\"/>{{Rp|41}} Like most rights, it is not unlimited, but state courts use the \"compelling state interest\" [[standard of review]] which looks at whether the government has a compelling interest for any actions implicating this right.<ref name=\"Overton-Giddings 1997\"/>{{Rp|38}} For example, while individuals may possess obscene materials in their homes, there is no right to privacy to patronize retail establishments selling such material.<!-- <ref name=\"Overton-Giddings 1997\"/>{{Rp|36}} --> The Florida Supreme Court has also decided that using one's real property in violation of legitimate environmental protection laws is not protected by this provision, as there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in such use.<ref name=\"Overton-Giddings 1997\"/>{{Rp|36}} The clause \"except as otherwise provided herein\" ensures that the provision does not impair law enforcement activities under Article I, Section 12 on searches and seizures, which is interpreted in parallel with the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].<ref name=\"Overton-Giddings 1997\"/>{{Rp|36}}\n\nCase law invoking this provision is divided into two main categories: personal autonomy and disclosure of information.<ref name=\"Overton-Giddings 1997\"/>{{Rp|38}} The provision guarantees individual the right to refuse life-saving medical treatment, food, and water\u2014but does not give individuals a right to physician-assisted suicide\u2014and protects the right to receive an abortion.

The rail system would likely run alongside the state's interstate system, and would likely be similar to those found in Japan and other locales.\n\nHowever, in 2004, the amendment was removed from the constitution via another ballot referendum. Governor Jeb Bush and some other legislators pushed for the inclusion of the ballot item to remove the amendment, claiming the rail network would be too costly to build. Jeb Bush, however, claimed that he was not opposed to the eventual construction of such a system, but that it should be managed by the Florida Department of Transportation. Proponents dispute the claim that the cost would be too high and say the presented cost estimates were highly exaggerated.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nIn the wake of the project's cancellation, a private sector express passenger service running across much of the proposed route was proposed by the [[Florida East Coast Railway]]. This project, Brightline (now [[Virgin Trains USA]]), began operations in early 2018.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikisource|Constitution of the State of Florida (1968)}}\n*[http://www.floridamemory.com/Collections/Constitution/ Florida's Early Constitution] The Florida Constitutions of 1838, 1861, 1865, 1868, and 1885 are available with transcripts and digitized images of the original documents.

The current [[State constitution (United States)|Constitution]] of Florida was ratified on November 5, 1968.\n\nFlorida has been governed by six different constitutions since acceding to the United States. Before 1838, only the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]] was briefly enacted in Florida. A monument commemorating ''[[Spanish Constitution of 1812|La Constituci\u00f3n de C\u00e1diz]]'' still stands in front of the [[Government House (St. Augustine)|Government House]] in [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]].\n\nFlorida's first constitution as a U.S. territory was written and implemented in 1838. On March 3, 1845, Florida was granted admission into the Union as the 27th state. The current Constitution of Florida was ratified on November 5, 1968, and has been modified by initiative and referendum several times since.\n\n== Constitution ==\n\n==='''The Florida Constitutional Convention'''===\nSee also [[Florida Constitutional Convention of 1838]]\n\nOne of the requirements for a [[United States territory]] to become a state of the union is that its constitution must be approved by the [[United     States Congress]]. In order to fulfill that requirement, an act was passed by the [[Florida Territorial Council]] in 1838, approved by Governor [[Richard Keith Call]], calling for the election of [[Delegate (American politics)|delegate]]s in October 1838 to a [[Political convention|convention]] to be held at [[St. Joseph, Gulf County, Florida|St. Joseph, Florida]]. The delegates were to draft a constitution and [[bill of rights]] for the Territory of Florida. The Constitutional Convention convened on December 3, 1838, with [[Robert R. Reid]] presiding as president and Joshua Knowles secretary. The work of the Convention was carried out by eighteen committees, whose members were familiar with that particular area of government. The process was a relatively simple one since they used the constitutions of several other Southern states as models. Only on the subject of banking did much debate take place. The Convention adjourned ''[[sine die]]'' on January 11, 1839.\n\nA handwritten copy of the 1838 Constitution or \"Form of Government for the People of Florida,\" signed by Convention President Robert Raymond Reid and Convention Secretary Joshua Knowles, resides at the State Archives of Florida. Considered \"a secretary's copy\" this document is the only known copy of the 1838 Constitution. The original Constitution, signed by all the delegates, has never been found.<ref>[http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?Mode=Constitution&Submenu=3&Tab=statutes/ FL Constitution]</ref> The preamble to the Constitution of 1838:<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.law.fsu.edu/crc/conhist/1838con.html |title=FSU Florida Constitution Revision Commission |access-date=2014-01-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111030001703/http://www.law.fsu.edu/crc/conhist/1838con.html |archive-date=2011-10-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n{{quote|We, the People of the Territory of Florida, by our Delegates in Convention, assembled at the City of St. Joseph, on Monday the 3d day of December, A.D. 1838, and of the Independence of the United States the sixty-third year, having and claiming the right of admission into the Union, as one of the United States of America, consistent with the principles of the Federal Constitution, and by virtue of the Treaty of Amity, Settlement, and Limits between the United States of America and the King of Spain, ceding the Provinces of East and West Florida to the United States; in order to secure to ourselves and our posterity the enjoyment of all the rights of life, liberty, and property, and the pursuit of happiness, do mutually agree, each with the other, to form ourselves into a Free and Independent State, by the name of the State of Florida.}}\n\n===Ordinance of Secession and the 1861 Constitution of Florida===\nIn 1860, the onrush of the [[American Civil War]] brought the election in Florida of a convention \"for the purpose of taking into consideration the position of this State in the Federal Union.\" Pursuant to an Act of the Legislature approved November 30, 1860, governor [[Madison S. Perry]] issued a proclamation calling an election on Saturday, December 22, 1860, for delegates to a Convention to address the issue of whether Florida had a right to withdraw from the Union. The Secession Convention met on January 3, 1861, in [[Tallahassee]], and produced for adoption on January 10 an Ordinance of Secession and a Constitution which largely altered the existing Constitution.  \n\nSome changes related directly to Florida's secession, such as substituting \"Confederate States\" for \"United States,\" removing the requirement that the governor be a citizen for the United States for ten years prior to his election, and declaring Florida to be \"a sovereign and independent nation.\" The governor's term was changed from four years to two years starting October 1865, an election never realized due to the Confederacy's defeat.  The 1861 Constitution also added several sections affecting the power of General Assembly of Florida, such as limiting the duration of sessions, allowing it to license toll bridges and pass general laws for name changes, prohibiting it from allowing married women or minors to contract or manage their estates, and prohibiting it from legitimizing bastards.  The General Assembly was also allowed to tax the lands and slaves of non-residents higher than residents and create special tribunals to try offenses committed by slaves, freemen, and mulattoes.  Public lands previously ceded to the United States government were deemed reclaimed by Florida but were to be used exclusively for paying the State's debts and necessary expenses, and such lands could not be granted for any other purpose.  Prohibitions on certain bankers and certain previous office holders from being elected until the expiration of a year from having left their prior position were removed. The 1861 Constitution was the first Florida Constitution to contain a clause prohibiting individuals from holding two offices simultaneously with limited exceptions.  No citizen of any of the States or Territories of the United States then at war with the Confederate States could be admitted to Florida citizenship, be eligible to vote or be elected, hold property, or work in the State of Florida.  The articles pertaining to the militia and corporations were largely reworded.  The General Assembly lost the ability to amend the Constitution, leaving a State convention as the only method of amendment.  The prohibition on the General Assembly forbidding emigrants to the State from bringing their slaves with them was repealed.  The article pertaining to the seat of government was removed.  Other changes included removing obsolete language stemming from Florida's creation as a State and codifying legislation enacted since Florida attained statehood.\n\nJohn C. McGehee of Madison County was elected president of the Convention, and the Convention ratified the Constitution adopted by the Confederate States of America on April 13 and [[Adjournment sine die|adjourned sine die]] on April 27, 1861.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nSince the Convention generally approved of Governor Perry's actions it made no move to interfere with his administration. However, when Governor John Milton took office in October 1861 and reversed some policies of his predecessor, a movement was started to reconvene the Convention. Convention president McGehee issued a proclamation on December 13 for the convention to meet on '''January 14, 1862''', at Tallahassee. McGehee expressed concern over two matters: the state's finances and the powers of the governor during wartime. To remedy the latter, the members appointed an Executive Council of four men to share the executive authority because they felt that the powers of a wartime executive should not be placed in the hands of one man. The Convention adjourned sine die on January 27, 1862.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n===The 1865 Florida Constitution (not approved)===\nIn October 1865, delegates met to revoke the Ordinance of Secession and write a new Constitution. This Constitution, since it limited [[suffrage]] to white male citizens, did not meet the requirements of [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] for seating delegates from the former Confederate states, and it was scrapped in favor of the Constitution of 1868.<ref>https://www.floridamemory.com/items/show/189093, retrieved April 21, 2016.</ref>\n\n===The 1868 Florida Constitution===<!-- This section heading is linked from [[Seminole Wars]] -->\nThe [[Reconstruction Era]] constitution returned civilian control of the state after Florida became subject to the military authority of the federal government in 1867. Pursuant to an Act of Congress, General [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]], Commander of the [[Third Military District]], issued an order on April 8, 1867, dividing the 39 counties of the State into 19 districts for the election of delegates to a convention to frame a new State Constitution. The new constitution had to conform with the [[United States Constitution|Federal Constitution]], including [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|the 13th]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendments]]. \n\nThe Convention met in [[Tallahassee]] on January 20, 1868. As deliberations got under way, bitterly divided factions were formed. Of the 46 elected delegates, 18 were black and at least 15 were former slaves, who were described as literate, \"gentlemen\", and \"eloquent\" by a Northern reporter who was present.<ref>{{cite article\n|last=Richardson\n|first=Joe\n|journal=[[Florida Historical Quarterly]]\n|title=A Northerner Reports on Florida\n|volume=40\n|date=April 1962\n|page=383}}</ref> According to historian Adam Wasserman, \"The radical delegates were in the vast majority and backed by a large militant black electorate.\"<ref name=Peoples>{{cite book\n|title=A People's History of Florida\n|edition=4th\n|first=Adam\n|last=Wasserman\n|year=2010\n|publisher=Adam Wasserman\n|isbn=9781442167094\n|page=527}}</ref> The \"moderates\" were \"a powerful organized lobby of Southern planters, Northern capitalists, and capitalists\".<ref name=Peoples />{{rp|529}} \n\nFor two weeks, the \"radical\" and \"moderate\" factions  debated. Under the leadership of future governor [[Harrison Reed (politician)|Harrison Reed]], the \"moderates\" tried to give the sparsely-populated white counties the same voting power as the heavily-populated black counties. The \"radicals\", however, would not agree to such an arrangement.\n\nSeeing no chance of victory, 19 of the \"moderate\" delegates decamped to nearby [[Monticello, Florida]].<ref name=Peoples />{{rp|529}} The \"radical\" majority proceeded to craft \"the initial and legitimate constitution\", signed it, and then adjourned for a week to hear back from the [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] military commander, General [[George Meade]]. On February 10, the 21 \"moderate\" delegates, with the aid of Democratic governor and ex-Confederate general [[David S. Walker]], broke into the hall at midnight. To ensure a [[quorum]], soldiers seized two of the \"radical\" delegates (who were in bed), and forced them to the hall. Between midnight and 2 AM, the \"moderates\" drafted a new constitution, \"protected by a guard of Federal soldiers outside the hall\". When the day came for the legal convention to meet again, soldiers with bayonets prevented the \"radicals\" from entering the hall.\n\nThe two constitutions were both submitted to General Meade; the Committee on Reconstruction subsequently adopted the \"moderate\" one, on Meade's recommendation. Under its terms for [[reapportionment]], less than one-fourth of voters would be able to elect a majority of the State Senate, and less than one-third could elect a majority of the Assembly. As stated in a letter to Senator [[David Yulee]], \"Under our Constitution the Judiciary & State officers will be appointed & the apportionment will prevent a negro legislature.\" [[Freedmen's Bureau]] agent [[William J. Furman]] later bragged that he had prevented Florida from being \"niggerized\".<ref name=Peoples />{{rp|531}}\n\nThe Constitution was adopted by the people of Florida in May 1868. It conferred the [[Suffrage|electoral franchise]] upon \"male persons\" instead of \"white male persons\", as in the 1865 Constitution. With its acceptance by the Federal military authorities, the State of Florida was recognized as being restored to the Union, and its senators and representatives were admitted to Congress.\n\nThis constitution stated that one seat in the House of Representatives and one in the Senate were to be allocated to the [[Seminole Indians]]; the seats were to be filled by a member of their tribe \"and in no case by a white man.\"<ref>[http://www.floridamemory.com/items/show/189095?id=29 Florida Constitution of 1868, Art. XVI, Section VII]</ref>  However, these positions were never filled, and this provision was not carried over into subsequent constitutions.\n\n===The 1885 Florida Constitution===\n{{Main|Florida Constitution of 1885}}\nThe [[Florida Constitutional Convention of 1885]] produced a constitution that reversed some of the aspects of the 1868 Constitution by establishing a poll tax to further disenfranchise African Americans. It also codified segregation. It established the makeup of the state government that continued until 1968.\n\nThe 1885 Legislature enacted Chapter 3577 calling for a Constitutional Convention in order to revise the Constitution of 1868. In May 1885 a general election for the selection of delegates was held throughout the state. The Convention met in Tallahassee from June 9 to August 3, 1885. [[Samuel Pasco]] of [[Jefferson County, Florida|Jefferson County]] presided. Pursuant to Ordinance No. 1 of the Convention, the Constitution was submitted to the citizens of Florida for ratification in November 1886. The 1885 Constitution was ratified by a 31,803 to 21,243 vote.\n\nThe new constitution legitimized a [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] as a prerequisite for voting (Article VI, Section 8), thus effectively causing disfranchisement of blacks and many poor whites. By 1888, voter turnout had decreased by 27%, and additional provisions were adopted that further suppressed voters registration and turnout.<ref>[http://www.jimcrowhistory.org/history/creating2.htm The History of Jim Crow] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070601223741/http://www.jimcrowhistory.org/history/creating2.htm |date=June 1, 2007 }}</ref> This constitution mandated racial segregation in schools (Article XII, Section 12), and prohibited marriage between \"a white person and a person of negro descent\" (Article XVI, Section 24).\n\n===The 1968 Florida Constitution===\nThe current Florida Constitution of 1968 was proposed on June 24-July 3 of 1968 via three joint resolutions in special sessions of the Florida Legislature. House Joint Resolution 1-2X included all revisions except for Article V, Article VI, and Article VIII. Senate Resolution 4-2X proposed the new Article VI which relates to elections and suffrage. Senate Resolution 5-2X proposed a new Article VIII which defined law regarding local government. Article V was included from the 1885 constitution as amended. [[Chesterfield Smith]] was the chair of the committee which drafted the Constitution; [[LeRoy Collins]] was also on the committee.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThe constitution was ratified via referendum by the electorate on November 5, 1968.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThe political context of this new Constitution was that it was a necessary step toward fair apportionment of legislative districts, required by the [[US Supreme Court]] in various decisions in the 1960s. Many states, including Florida. had allotted a fixed number of senators per county, regardless of population, since the republic began. This violated the new federal court decisions. The regular political process had failed to remedy this. The malapportionment, until the new Constitution, had strongly favored rural, North Florida legislators, including the [[Pork Chop Gang]], over legislators from more populous, urban districts.<ref>Rick Edmonds, \"LeRoy Collins and the making of modern Florida\", ''[[Tampa Bay Times]]'', October 30, 2013, http://www.tampabay.com/news/perspective/leroy-collins-and-the-making-of-modern-florida/2150025, retrieved 14 July 2015.</ref> In 1960, \"12.3% of the population could elect a majority in the state senate and 14.7% could do the same in the lower house.\"<ref>{{cite book\n|pages=362\u2013363\n|first=T.

The change became effective January 7, 2003, and the Florida Cabinet now consists of the attorney general, the chief financial officer and the commissioner of agriculture. The secretary of state and commissioner of education became appointed positions and their respective agencies became the responsibility of the governor. The revised constitution also created a new State Board of Education with seven members appointed by the governor to oversee the Department of Education.

Not until 1971 in a special session did the Legislature pass Senate Joint Resolution 52-D proposing to the voters the \"modern\" Article V.<ref name=\"Article V\">The 1971 proposed rewrite of Article V was approved by the voters in 1972. It established uniform courts throughout Florida, set the jurisdiction of the courts, required that all judges be full time, established the judicial nominating commission, and revised the judicial qualifications commission.</ref>\n\n===Article I:  \"Declaration of Rights\"===\nThe first article of the Florida Constitution contains the state's bill of rights which is very similar to the [[United States Bill of Rights]] except that there are more elaborations very similar to interpretations of the Bill of Rights by the United States Supreme Court, such as a clause stating that the freedom of religion cannot be used to justify immoral acts.  Florida's Declaration of Rights also states that capital punishment is not unconstitutional. Search and seizure and cruel and unusual punishment protections are to be consistent with the United States Supreme Court's interpretation of those rights.\n\n===Article II: \"General Provisions\"===\nThe Florida constitution provides for an executive, legislative, and judicial branch. Unlike the U.S. Constitution, it mandates a separation of powers. The Florida Supreme Court has interpreted the \"separation of powers\" requirement to prohibit both encroachment by any one branch on the powers held by another and delegation by any branch of its powers.\n\nSection one denotes the official state boundaries.\n\nSection two denotes basic rights.\n\nSection three prescribes for separation of powers.\n\nSection seven mandates that those living in the Everglades Protection Area, who cause water pollution, will be primarily responsible for its remediation.\n\nSection nine mandates that English is the official language of the state.\n\n\n===Article III: \"Legislature\"===\nArticle III requires that the Florida Legislature be a bicameral body, with an upper house of not more than 40 members elected to four-year terms, and a lower house of not more 120 members elected to two-year terms.\n\nSections 10 and 11 discuss special laws (those affecting portions of the state, not the entire) and prohibitions against it.\n\nSection six discusses the \"single subject requirement\" limitation on laws.\n\nSections 20 and 21 set standards for drawing congressional and legislative districts.\n\n===Article IV: \"Executive\"===\nArticle IV governs the election of the Florida governor and lieutenant governor, and of the Florida Cabinet. It currently specifies that the cabinet will consist of an attorney general, a chief financial officer, and a commissioner of agriculture with specifically defined powers, and it designates them as elected rather than appointed.\n\n===Article V: \"Judiciary\"===\nArticle V establishes the [[Florida Supreme Court]] and the Florida District Courts of Appeal, as well as circuit and county courts, describes how they are to be appointed, and sets forth their jurisdiction.  It has been amended a number of times since ratification of the 1968 Constitution.  Most notably, the voters approved extensive amendments in 1972 to create a unified state courts system, placing all lower courts under the administrative supervision of Florida's chief justice.  This change required the creation of a new Florida Office of the State Courts Administrator, which assists the chief justice.  The 1972 amendments further reduced the different kinds of courts that existed in Florida from ten to four and made this system uniform throughout the state for the first time in Florida history.  An amendment ratified in 1976 ended contested elections for Florida's appellate judges and made them subject to merit retention votes under a modified [[Missouri Plan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/pub_info/system2.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705081802/http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/pub_info/system2.shtml |archivedate=2010-07-05 }}</ref>\n\n===Article VI: \"Suffrage and Elections\"===\nDiscusses the requirements for voters and when voting rights are disqualified.\n\nSection 4(b) places eight-year term limits on all legislative and executive office holders.  (The section also places limits on Congressional officeholders; however, these provisions were ruled unconstitutional elsewhere and thus have no effect.)\n\n===Article VII : \"Finance and Taxation\"===\nArticle VII specifically prohibits the levying of an income tax, except via very strict limitations.\n\nThe article further delineates the purposes for which bonds can be issued, and requires that certain bonds be approved by the voters in the affected area.\n\n===Article VIII: \"Local Government\"===\nArticle VIII covers municipal and county government, and distinguishes between charter counties and non-charter counties. Two key distinctions are set forth therein:\n\n# Counties may enact any ordinance that is not inconsistent with general or special state law.  In charter counties, a governing special law can be one passed by the county's voters, provided it is not inconsistent with general state law.  In non-charter counties, a governing special law must be one passed by the state legislature.\n# Municipal ordinances override inconsistent ordinances passed by non-charter counties; for chartered counties, the charter itself will determine which ordinance governs when there is a conflict.\n\nSection 1 of this Article also establishes the following elected county officers for terms of four years<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?Mode=Constitution&Submenu=3&Tab=statutes#A8S01|title=Art VIII, 1(d), Fla.

Extracurricular classes are specifically exempt.\n\nSection 1(b) also mandates a voluntary PK-4 program in all public schools.\n\nUnder Section 4, each county is a separate school district, though contiguous counties may combine into one school district upon voter approval.\n\nSection 5 requires that the county school superintendent is elected by the voters unless legislation has been passed which allows the individual to be employed by the school board.\n\nSection 7 discusses the Florida State University System and its bi-level governing structure.\n\nThe overall system is governed by a 17-member Board of Governors, of which 14 members are appointed by the [[governor of Florida]] with the consent of the [[Florida Senate]] and serve staggered seven-year terms.  The remaining three members consist of the Florida Commissioner of Education, the chair of the advisory council of faculty senates (or the equivalent), and the president of the Florida Student Association.\n\nIn addition, each university is governed by a 13-member Board of Trustees, of which six members are appointed by the governor and five members appointed by the Board of Governors, with the consent of the Florida Senate and serve staggered five-year terms.  The remaining two members consist of the chair of the university's faculty senate and the president of the university's student body.\n\n===Article X: \"Miscellaneous\"===\nIncludes various provisions.\n\nSection 4 lays out Florida's homestead exemption provision, considered one of the most protective in the nation for resident property owners.  The provision exempts from forced sale (except [[tax sale|to pay taxes]], [[mortgage]]s, or [[mechanic's lien]]) 160 acres of contiguous land plus all improvements (if located outside a municipality) or 1/2 acre of contiguous land plus all improvements (if located inside a municipality), regardless of the property's value, plus personal property up to US$1,000.  Upon the owner's death, the exemptions extend to the surviving spouse or to the heirs.\n\nSection 6c, resulting from the ''[[Kelo v. City of New London]]'' decision, prohibits the conveyance of property taken by eminent domain to another person or private entity without 3/5ths approval of both houses of the [[Florida Legislature]].\n\nThis article contains sections both prohibiting lotteries (Section 7) and simultaneously [[Florida Lottery|allowing them]] (Section 15).\n\nSection 16 discusses about the limitations on marine net fishing.\n\nSection 20 contains the constitution prohibition against smoking in all indoor workplaces.\n\nSection 21 contains a prohibition \"[l]imiting cruel and inhumane confinement of [[pig]]s during pregnancy\".\n\nSection 22 requires parental notification prior to a minor obtaining an [[abortion]].\n\nSection 24 specifies the state [[minimum wage]].  Unlike the Federal and other state minimum wage laws, this section contains an annual index to adjust the wage for inflation (the wage is adjusted effective January 1 of each year).\n\nSection 25, re-enacted as \"Amendment 7,\" regards a patient's right to discover records related to adverse medical incidents\n\nSection 26 required the automatic revocation of any medical license where the provider has committed three or more incidents of medical malpractice.\n\n===Article XI: \"Amendments\"===\nThe method of \"compilation\" for the Florida Constitution is unlike that of the federal constitution. When the Florida Constitution is amended the official text of the document is edited, removing language that is no longer in force. The Division of Statutory Revision within the Office of Legislative Services is responsible for codifying new amendments and removing obsolete language.<ref>[http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0000-0099/0011/Sections/0011.242.html \u00a7 11.242, Fla. Stat. (2016)]</ref>\n\nHowever, the constitution usually includes history notes appended to the sections indicating when parts of it were amended, except that sections which were a part of the 1968 revision do not contain history notes prior to 1968.  The section, indexes, headings, and notes are considered editorial features and not part of the Constitution per se, and thus do not convey any rights.\n\n====Proposing amendments====\nThe Florida Constitution provides five methods for proposing amendments:\n* By the [[Florida Legislature]], with a three-fifths vote of the membership of both houses.\n* By the Constitution Revision Commission, which is established every 20 years to consider and propose amendments (the Commission first met in 1977 and again in 1997; the next scheduled meeting is in 2037).<ref>[http://www.law.fsu.edu/crc/ Florida Constitutional Revision Commission website: Our Purpose]</ref> The Commission consists of 37 members: the [[Florida Attorney General|Florida attorney general]], 15 members selected by the [[governor of Florida]] (who also designates the chair), nine members selected by the speaker of the [[Florida House of Representatives]], nine members selected by the president of the [[Florida Senate]], and three members selected by the chief justice of the [[Florida Supreme Court]] with the advice of the other justices.\n* By the Taxation and Budget Reform Commission, which is established every 20 years to consider and propose amendments (the Commission first met in 2007; the next scheduled meeting is in 2027). The Commission consists of 25 members: 11 members selected by the governor, seven members selected by the Speaker of the Florida House, and seven members selected by the Leader of the Florida Senate; however, none of the members can be a member of the Legislature at the time of selection).  In addition, the Commission has four [[ex officio]] members who are members of the Legislature: two selected by the House Speaker and two by the Senate President; both the Speaker and President must select one of its ex officio members from the minority party.\n* By a constitutional convention, which is called by the simple majority approval of a [[initiative|voter initiative]] asking for a convention.\n* By voter initiative, as a proposed amendment to appear on the ballot. By law, any such amendment 1) is limited to a single subject, 2) must include a ballot title not to exceed 15 words in length, 3) must also include a ballot summary not to exceed 75 words in length, and 4) must further include a financial impact statement not to exceed 75 words in length.\n\n====Amendment approval====\nExcept as noted below, all amendments proposed, regardless of the method of proposal, must be approved by 60 percent of the voters in a referendum held simultaneously with the next general election (that is, the next one at least 90 days after the amendment is filed with the custodian of state records) before they become a part of the Constitution. Previously, the ballot initiatives required only a simple majority (more than 50%) to be approved. A 2006 amendment raised the required threshold to a supermajority (60%).\n\nAmendments involving the creation of \"new State taxes or fees\" require a two-thirds approval of the voters.\n\nThe Legislature, via a three-fourths majority, may pass a law calling for a special election date on any amendment (again, which must be 90 days after the amendment is filed with the custodian of state records).\n\n====Notable amendments====\nMany diverse, and sometimes controversial, amendments have been proposed to the Florida Constitution over the years. From modifications to the amendment process itself to parental notification of a minor's intent to terminate a pregnancy, to minimum wage increases, to limiting cruel and inhumane confinement of pigs during pregnancy.\n\n=====Right to privacy=====\n{{see also|Right to privacy#United States|Privacy laws of the United States}}\nArticle I, Section 23 of the Florida Constitution provides:<ref>{{cite web|title=The Florida Constitution|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?submenu=3#A2|website=Online Sunshine|publisher=The Florida Legislature|accessdate=15 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|'''Right of privacy.''' \u2014 Every natural person has the right to be let alone and free from governmental intrusion into the person's private life except as otherwise provided herein.

It was put to the electorate by the Commission as part of a package of provisions in a single amendment, which failed. In 1980, the Florida Legislature, believing there was significant public interest in this provision, passed a resolution placing the provision as a single amendment on the 1980 general election that was approved by voters, becoming a part of the Florida Constitution.<ref name=\"Overton-Giddings 1997\">{{cite journal |last1=Overton |first1=Ben F. |last2=Giddings |first2=Katherine E. |date=1997 |title=The Right of Privacy in Florida in the Age of Technology and the Twenty-First Century: A Need for Protection from Private and Commercial Intrusion |journal=Florida State University Law Review |volume=25 |issue= |pages=25\u201355 |url=http://ir.law.fsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1394&context=lr |access-date=15 July 2017 }}</ref>{{Rp|25, 34\u201335}}\n\nThe provision extends to the private lives of all natural persons, including minors, but only protects them from intrusion by ''government'', not private individuals or corporations.<ref name=\"Overton-Giddings 1997\"/>{{Rp|26, 35\u201336}} It affords more protection than [[Privacy laws of the United States#Federal|the right to privacy under the Federal Constitution]].<ref name=\"Overton-Giddings 1997\"/>{{Rp|41}} Like most rights, it is not unlimited, but state courts use the \"compelling state interest\" [[standard of review]] which looks at whether the government has a compelling interest for any actions implicating this right.<ref name=\"Overton-Giddings 1997\"/>{{Rp|38}} For example, while individuals may possess obscene materials in their homes, there is no right to privacy to patronize retail establishments selling such material.<!-- <ref name=\"Overton-Giddings 1997\"/>{{Rp|36}} --> The Florida Supreme Court has also decided that using one's real property in violation of legitimate environmental protection laws is not protected by this provision, as there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in such use.<ref name=\"Overton-Giddings 1997\"/>{{Rp|36}} The clause \"except as otherwise provided herein\" ensures that the provision does not impair law enforcement activities under Article I, Section 12 on searches and seizures, which is interpreted in parallel with the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].<ref name=\"Overton-Giddings 1997\"/>{{Rp|36}}\n\nCase law invoking this provision is divided into two main categories: personal autonomy and disclosure of information.<ref name=\"Overton-Giddings 1997\"/>{{Rp|38}} The provision guarantees individual the right to refuse life-saving medical treatment, food, and water\u2014but does not give individuals a right to physician-assisted suicide\u2014and protects the right to receive an abortion.

The rail system would likely run alongside the state's interstate system, and would likely be similar to those found in Japan and other locales.\n\nHowever, in 2004, the amendment was removed from the constitution via another ballot referendum. Governor Jeb Bush and some other legislators pushed for the inclusion of the ballot item to remove the amendment, claiming the rail network would be too costly to build. Jeb Bush, however, claimed that he was not opposed to the eventual construction of such a system, but that it should be managed by the Florida Department of Transportation.
