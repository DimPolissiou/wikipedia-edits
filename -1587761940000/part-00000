Under the watchful eyes of 2800 spectators, CAA had the ball on Newton's 5 yard line, with 35 seconds to go.  First, second, and third down went by with no gain for the Chicago AA Eleven.  With 10 seconds remaining, it was still Chicago's possession, and with one last shove at the Newton Defensive Line, Full Back Brown rolled into the endzone over a mass of players, achieving a walk-off touchdown and subsequent PAT.  The game could've been won in the first half, had Chicago AA not fumbled on the Newton AC 4 yard line, but besides that the game was close and both sides held up well.  Stevenson was the center of attention for the Athletics, holding the line firm and knocking back Newton's star player,Mr. Draper, numerous times throughout the contest.  Brown also had a good game, and Bartl got injured.  <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/49425460/chicago-athletes-win-their-game-at/|title=Chicago Athletes Win Their Game at Newton, Mass, 4 To 0.|date=1895-10-27|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=2020-04-24|pages=6}}</ref>\n\n==Roster==\nThere are a few things to note about the 1895 Chicago Athletic Association roster.  One is that positions were not as set in stone as they are in the modern day, and no one on the team had the same position for the whole season (possibly with the exception of star center Archibald Stevenson, who only missed the exhibition against Swift & Co.).  Furthermore, it was a rarity for a team member to play every game in the season, due to the moderate influx of new players every couple weeks and higher risk of injury from the game.  Only Ben Thomas, a Left Tackle/Guard, managed to play every game, and if you don't include the exhibition, that only adds Stevenson.  There were several \"regulars\" though, those who played at least seven or more games in the season.  Those players were Fred Slater, Paul Brown, Ben Thomas, CB Coffeen, DA Stone, Harry G. Hadden, Archibald Stevenson, JR Huddelson, Aldrich, and Olin McCormick.  Notable members of this roster are Harry Hadden, who coached Notre Dame in 1895, Jesse Van Doozer, Northwestern's 1897 coach, and the infamous \"Pudge\" Heffelfinger, who played 4 years at Yale, was a three-time All American, and is credited as the first professional (payed) American football player.\n\n===Past playing experience===\nMost members of the team also had past playing experience at colleges, universities, local, and athletic (semi-pro) teams.

The Indianapolis Journal described the CAA team as a machine, and gave credit to Brown, Slater, Camp, Hadden and Coffeen for good runs.  Thompson made the first touchdown, followed by Brown, and then Camp, with Brown going 2 for 3 on PATs.  The ILA team had some minor disagreements with the referring, but overall claimed the CAA had great teamwork, and was well trained in interference (blocking and tackling).  <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/31607367/chicago-athletic-club-16-indianapolis/|title=Chicago Athletic Club 16 @Indianapolis Light Artillery 0 AND|date=1895-10-20|work=The Indianapolis Journal|access-date=2020-04-23|pages=3}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/49392581/artillerymen-are-defeated-by-a-score-of/|title=Artillerymen Are Defeated by a Score of 16 to 0.|date=1895-10-20|work=The Inter Ocean|access-date=2020-04-23|pages=10}}</ref>\n\n'''October 22:''' Mr. Mulliken, a man with past experience at Columbia and on the Crescent Athletic Club of Brooklyn, decides to join the Chicago AA eleven. CAA also began preparation for their journey to the east, and sent out the first roster of those going.  The initial list was, Stone and Thompson as Left Ends, Thomas Left Tackle, Ryan Left Guard, Stevenson Center, Bartl and Mulliken Right Guards, McCormick Right Tackle, Hadden Right End, Aldrich Quarterback, Coffeen, Blaney and Hoagland Right Half Backs, Slater Left Half Back, and Brown Full Back.  Camp would not attend the trip East due to ill health.  Another important event to note is the football teams of Rush Medical College and Lake Forest combining for the remainder of the 1895 season.  Rush would bolster the Lake Forest ranks, while also attempting Lake Forest's reportedly impossible schedule of [[1895 Northwestern Purple football team|Northwestern]], [[1895 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]], and [[1895 Illinois Fighting Illini football team|Illinois]], who at the time had a combined record of 9-3, with Michigan undefeated.  Lake Forest had also just come from contests between the likes of [[1895 Wisconsin Badgers football team|Wisconsin]] and [[1895 Chicago Maroons football team|Chicago]], who had beaten them 52 to 0 and 26 to 5 respectively.  They had even lost to the minor team Amour, 6 to 0, and so when a merger was proposed between them and Rush, the agreement was made.  The two teams hoped to stand a better chance against the CAA as well when they play them this afternoon.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/49392812/c-a-a-and-lake-forest-meet/|title=C.

Blaney attained another touchdown at the beginning of the next half, with Thomas also scoring the last touchdown, and Brown rounding out the score to 30 with his impeccable kicking.

Under the watchful eyes of 2800 spectators, CAA had the ball on Newton's 5 yard line, with 35 seconds to go.  First, second, and third down went by with no gain for the Chicago AA Eleven.  With 10 seconds remaining, it was still Chicago's possession, and with one last shove at the Newton Defensive Line, Full Back Brown rolled into the endzone over a mass of players, achieving a walk-off touchdown and subsequent PAT.  The game could've been won in the first half, had Chicago AA not fumbled on the Newton AC 4 yard line, but besides that the game was close and both sides held up well.  Stevenson was the center of attention for the Athletics, holding the line firm and knocking back Newton's star player,Mr. Draper, numerous times throughout the contest.  Brown also had a good game, and Bartl got injured.  <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/49425460/chicago-athletes-win-their-game-at/|title=Chicago Athletes Win Their Game at Newton, Mass, 4 To 0.|date=1895-10-27|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=2020-04-24|pages=6}}</ref>\n\n==Roster==\nThere are a few things to note about the 1895 Chicago Athletic Association roster.  One is that positions were not as set in stone as they are in the modern day, and no one on the team had the same position for the whole season (possibly with the exception of star center Archibald Stevenson, who only missed the exhibition against Swift & Co.).  Furthermore, it was a rarity for a team member to play every game in the season, due to the moderate influx of new players every couple weeks and higher risk of injury from the game.  Only Ben Thomas, a Left Tackle/Guard, managed to play every game, and if you don't include the exhibition, that only adds Stevenson.  There were several \"regulars\" though, those who played at least seven or more games in the season.  Those players were Fred Slater, Paul Brown, Ben Thomas, CB Coffeen, DA Stone, Harry G. Hadden, Archibald Stevenson, JR Huddelson, Aldrich, and Olin McCormick.  Notable members of this roster are Harry Hadden, who coached Notre Dame in 1895, Jesse Van Doozer, Northwestern's 1897 coach, and the infamous \"Pudge\" Heffelfinger, who played 4 years at Yale, was a three-time All American, and is credited as the first professional (payed) American football player.\n\n===Past playing experience===\nMost members of the team also had past playing experience at colleges, universities, local, and athletic (semi-pro) teams.

It comprises most of the languages of Europe together with those of the northern [[Indian Subcontinent]] and the [[Iranian Plateau]]. A few of these languages, such as English, have expanded through [[colonialism]] in the modern period and are now spoken across all continents. The Indo-European family is divided into several branches or sub-families, the largest of which are the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]], [[Germanic language|Germanic]], [[Romance languages|Romance]], and [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]] groups. The most populous individual languages within them are [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[English language|English]], [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] ([[Hindi]]/[[Urdu]]), [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], and [[Russian language|Russian]], each with over 100 million speakers. [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Persian language|Persian]] have more than 50 million each. In total, 46% of the world's population (3.2 billion) speaks an Indo-European language as a first language, by far the highest of any language family. There are about 445 living Indo-European languages, according to the estimate by ''[[Ethnologue]]'', with over two thirds (313) of them belonging to the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian branch]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=2-16|title=Ethnologue report for Indo-European|publisher=Ethnologue.com}}</ref> \n\nAll Indo-European languages are descendants of a single prehistoric language, [[Linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] as [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]], spoken sometime in the [[Neolithic]] era. Its precise geographical location, the Indo-European [[Proto-Indo-European Urheimat hypotheses|''urheimat'']], is unknown and has been the object of many competing hypotheses. By the time the first written records appeared, Indo-European had already spread out into a large number of languages spoken across much of Europe and south-west Asia. Written evidence of Indo-European appeared during the [[Bronze Age]] in the form of [[Mycenaean Greek]] and the [[Anatolian languages]], [[Hittite language|Hittite]] and [[Luwian language|Luwian]]. The oldest records are isolated Hittite words and names \u2013 interspersed in texts that are otherwise in the unrelated [[Akkadian language|Old Assyrian]] language, a [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] language \u2013 found in the texts of the Assyrian colony of [[K\u00fcltepe]] in eastern Anatolia in the 20th century BC.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bryce |first=Trevor |date= 2005|title=Kingdom of the Hittites: New Edition |url= |location= |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=37 |isbn=978-0-19-928132-9 |access-date= }}</ref> Although no older written records of the original [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]] remain, some aspects of their culture and [[Proto-Indo-European religion|religion]] can be reconstructed from later evidence in the daughter cultures.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Introduction to Proto-Indo-European and the Proto-Indo-European World|last=Mallory|first=J.

The analysis of the family relationships between the Indo-European languages and the reconstruction of their common source was central to the development of the methodology of historical linguistics as an academic discipline in the 19th century.\n\nThe Indo-European family is not known to be linked to any other language family through any more distant genetic relationship, although several [[#Suggested macrofamilies|disputed proposals]] to that effect have been made. \n\nDuring the nineteenth century, the linguistic concept of Indo-European languages was frequently used interchangeably with the racial concepts of [[Aryan race|Aryan]] and [[Japhetite]].<ref name=\"Kidd2006\">{{cite book|author=Colin Kidd|title=The Forging of Races: Race and Scripture in the Protestant Atlantic World, 1600\u20132000|url={{Google books|aNT3q1HjY_MC|page=PA23|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-45753-8|pages=23\u2013}}</ref>\n\n==History of Indo-European linguistics==\n{{See also|Indo-European studies#History}}\nIn the 16th century, European visitors to the [[Indian subcontinent]] began to notice similarities among [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]], [[Iranian languages|Iranian]], and [[languages of Europe|European]] languages.

Membership in the various branches, groups and subgroups of Indo-European is also genealogical, but here the defining factors are ''shared innovations'' among various languages, suggesting a common ancestor that split off from other Indo-European groups. For example, what makes the Germanic languages a branch of Indo-European is that much of their structure and phonology can be stated in rules that apply to all of them. Many of their common features are presumed innovations that took place in [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]], the source of all the Germanic languages.\n\n===Tree versus wave model===\n{{See also|Language change}}\nThe \"[[tree model]]\" is considered an appropriate representation of the genealogical history of a language family if communities do not remain in contact after their languages have started to diverge. In this case, subgroups defined by shared innovations form a nested pattern. The tree model is not appropriate in cases where languages remain in contact as they diversify; in such cases subgroups may overlap, and the \"[[Wave model (linguistics)|wave model]]\" is a more accurate representation.<ref>{{Citation\n  | last = Fran\u00e7ois\n  | first = Alexandre\n  | contribution = Trees, Waves and Linkages: Models of Language Diversification\n  | editor1-last = Bowern\n  | editor1-first = Claire\n  | editor2-last = Evans\n  | editor2-first = Bethwyn\n  | title = The Routledge Handbook of Historical Linguistics\n  | series=\n  | pages = 161\u201389\n  | publisher = Routledge\n  | place = London\n  | year = 2014\n  | isbn = 978-0-415-52789-7\n  | contribution-url = http://alex.francois.free.fr/data/AlexFrancois_2014_HHL_Trees-waves-linkages_Diversification.pdf\n  | ref = francois\n }}</ref> Most approaches to Indo-European subgrouping to date have assumed that the tree model is by-and-large valid for Indo-European;<ref>{{cite journal | title= From August Schleicher to Sergei Starostin: on the development of the tree-diagram models of the Indo-European languages | author= Bla\u017eek, V\u00e1clav | journal= Journal of Indo-European Studies | year= 2007 | volume= 35 | issue= 1\u20132 | pages= 82\u2013109}}</ref> however, there is also a long tradition of wave-model approaches.<ref>{{cite book | title= Les dialectes indo-europ\u00e9ens | publisher= Honor\u00e9 Champion | author= Meillet, Antoine | year= 1908 | location= Paris}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title= I dialetti indoeuropei | publisher= Paideia | author= Bonfante, Giuliano | year= 1931 | location= Brescia}}</ref>{{sfn|Porzig|1954}}\n\nIn addition to genealogical changes, many of the early changes in Indo-European languages can be attributed to [[language contact]]. It has been asserted, for example, that many of the more striking features shared by Italic languages (Latin, Oscan, Umbrian, etc.) might well be [[Areal feature (linguistics)|areal features]]. More certainly, very similar-looking alterations in the systems of [[long vowel]]s in the West Germanic languages greatly postdate any possible notion of a [[proto-language]] innovation (and cannot readily be regarded as \"areal\", either, because English and continental West Germanic were not a linguistic area). In a similar vein, there are many similar innovations in Germanic and Balto-Slavic that are far more likely areal features than traceable to a common proto-language, such as the uniform development of a [[high vowel]] (*''u'' in the case of Germanic, *''i/u'' in the case of Baltic and Slavic) before the PIE syllabic resonants *''\u1e5b, *\u1e37, *\u1e43, *\u1e47'', unique to these two groups among IE languages, which is in agreement with the wave model. The [[Balkan sprachbund]] even features areal convergence among members of very different branches.\n\nAn extension to the ''[[Donald Ringe|Ringe]]-[[Tandy Warnow|Warnow]] model of language evolution'', suggests that early IE had featured limited contact between distinct lineages, with only the Germanic subfamily exhibiting a less treelike behaviour as it acquired some characteristics from neighbours early in its evolution. The internal diversification of especially West Germanic is cited to have been radically non-treelike.<ref>{{Cite journal |url= http://www.cs.rice.edu/~nakhleh/Papers/NRWlanguage.pdf |title= Perfect Phylogenetic Networks: A New Methodology for Reconstructing the Evolutionary History of Natural Languages |first= Luay |last= Nakhleh |first2= Don |last2= Ringe |lastauthoramp= yes |first3= Tandy |last3= Warnow|author3-link= Tandy Warnow |year= 2005 |journal= Language |volume= 81 |issue= 2 |pages= 382\u2013420 |doi= 10.1353/lan.2005.0078 |postscript= <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

According to another view, the Anatolian subgroup left the Indo-European parent language comparatively late, approximately at the same time as Indo-Iranian and later than the Greek or Armenian divisions. A third view, especially prevalent in the so-called French school of Indo-European studies, holds that extant similarities in non-[[satem]] languages in general\u2014including Anatolian\u2014might be due to their peripheral location in the Indo-European language-area and to early separation, rather than indicating a special ancestral relationship.<ref>''Britannica'' 15th edition, 22 p. 594, \"Indo-Hittite hypothesis\"</ref> Hans J.

In the satem languages, which include the Balto-Slavic and Indo-Iranian branches, as well as (in most respects) Albanian and Armenian, the reconstructed [[Proto-Indo-European phonology#Consonants|Proto-Indo-European palatovelars]] remained distinct and were fricativized, while the labiovelars merged with the 'plain velars.' In the centum languages, the palatovelars merged with the plain velars, while the labiovelars remained distinct. The results of these alternative developments are exemplified by the words for \"hundred\" in Avestan (''satem'') and Latin (''centum'')\u2014the initial palatovelar developed into a fricative [s] in the former, but became an ordinary velar [k] in the latter.\n\nRather than being a genealogical separation, the centum\u2013satem division is commonly seen as resulting from innovative changes that spread across PIE dialect-branches over a particular geographical area; the centum\u2013satem [[isogloss]] intersects a number of other isoglosses that mark distinctions between features in the early IE branches. It may be that the centum branches in fact reflect the original state of affairs in PIE, and only the satem branches shared a set of innovations, which affected all but the peripheral areas of the PIE dialect continuum.<ref>''Britannica'' 15th edition, vol.22, 1981, pp. 588, 594</ref> Kortlandt proposes that the ancestors of Balts and Slavs took part in satemization before being drawn later into the western Indo-European sphere.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.kortlandt.nl/publications/art111e.pdf |first= Frederik |last= Kortlandt |title= The spread of the Indo-Europeans |year= 1989 |accessdate= 2010-08-07}}</ref>\n\n===Suggested macrofamilies===\n\nSome linguists propose that Indo-European languages form part of one of several hypothetical [[macrofamily|macrofamilies]]. However, these theories remain highly controversial, not being accepted by most linguists in the field. Some of the smaller proposed macrofamilies include:\n* [[Pontic languages|Pontic]], postulated by [[John Colarusso]], which joins Indo-European with [[Northwest Caucasian languages|Northwest Caucasian]]\n* [[Indo-Uralic languages|Indo-Uralic]], joining Indo-European with [[Uralic languages|Uralic]]\n\nOther, greater proposed families including Indo-European languages, include:\n* [[Eurasiatic languages|Eurasiatic]], a theory championed by [[Joseph Greenberg]], comprising the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]], [[Altaic languages|Altaic]] and various '[[Paleosiberian languages|Paleosiberian]]' families ([[Ainu language|Ainu]], [[Yukaghir languages|Yukaghir]], [[Nivkh languages|Nivkh]], [[Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages|Chukotko-Kamchatkan]], [[Eskimo-Aleut languages|Eskimo-Aleut]]) and possibly others\n* [[Nostratic languages|Nostratic]], comprising all or some of the Eurasiatic languages as well as the [[Kartvelian languages|Kartvelian]], [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] (or wider, [[Elamo-Dravidian languages|Elamo-Dravidian]]) and [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] language families\n\nObjections to such groupings are not based on any theoretical claim about the likely historical existence or non-existence of such macrofamilies; it is entirely reasonable to suppose that they might have existed. The serious difficulty lies in identifying the details of actual relationships between language families, because it is very hard to find concrete evidence that transcends chance resemblance, or is not equally likely explained as being due to [[loanword|borrowing]] (including [[Wanderwort|Wanderw\u00f6rter]], which can travel very long distances). Because the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] in historical linguistics declines over time, at great enough time-depths it becomes open to reasonable doubt that one can even distinguish between signal and noise.\n\n==Evolution==\n\n===Proto-Indo-European===\n{{Main|Proto-Indo-European language}}\n[[File:IE expansion.png|upright=0.9|thumb|Scheme of Indo-European migrations from ca. 4000 to 1000 BC according to the [[Kurgan hypothesis]].]]\nThe proposed Proto-Indo-European language (PIE) is the [[Comparative method|reconstructed]] common ancestor of the Indo-European languages, spoken by the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]]. From the 1960s, knowledge of Anatolian became certain enough to establish its relationship to PIE. Using the method of [[internal reconstruction]], an earlier stage, called Pre-Proto-Indo-European, has been proposed.\n\nPIE was an [[inflected language]], in which the grammatical relationships between words were signaled through inflectional morphemes (usually endings). The [[root (linguistics)|roots]] of PIE are basic [[morpheme]]s carrying a [[lexical (semiotics)|lexical]] meaning. By addition of [[suffix]]es, they form [[stem (linguistics)|stems]], and by addition of [[Ending (linguistics)|endings]], these form grammatically inflected words ([[Indo-European noun|nouns]] or [[Indo-European verb|verbs]]). The reconstructed [[Indo-European verb]] system is complex and, like the noun, exhibits a system of [[Indo-European ablaut|ablaut]].\n\n===Diversification===\n{{See also|Indo-European migrations}}\n{{Gallery\n|title=Possible expansion of Indo-European languages according to the Kurgan hypothesis\n|width=180 | height=100\n|align=center\n|footer=\n|File:IE5500BP.png\n |alt1=IE languages 3500 BC\n |IE languages c. 3500 BC\n|File:IE4500BP.png\n |alt2=IE languages 2500 BC\n |IE languages c. 2500 BC\n|File:IE3500BP.png\n |alt3=IE languages 1500 BC\n |IE languages c. 1500 BC\n|File:IE1500BP.png\n |alt4=IE languages 500 AD\n |IE languages c. 500 AD\n}}\nThe diversification of the parent language into the attested branches of daughter languages is historically unattested.

These generally include the ancient Indo-European languages that are both well-attested and documented at an early date, although some languages from later periods are important if they are particularly [[conservative (language)|linguistically conservative]] (most notably, [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]). Early poetry is of special significance because of the rigid [[poetic meter]] normally employed, which makes it possible to reconstruct a number of features (e.g. [[vowel length]]) that were either unwritten or corrupted in the process of transmission down to the earliest extant written [[manuscript]]s.\n\nMost noticeable of all:<ref name=\"Beekes2011One\">{{cite book|author=Robert S.P.

This language is unique in that its source documents were all composed orally, and were passed down through [[oral tradition]] ([[shakha]] schools) for c. 2,000 years before ever being written down. The oldest documents are all in poetic form; oldest and most important of all is the [[Rigveda]] (c. 1500 BC).\n* [[Ancient Greek]] (c. 750\u2013400 BC). [[Mycenaean Greek]] (c. 1450 BC) is the oldest recorded form, but its value is lessened by the limited material, restricted subject matter, and highly ambiguous writing system. More important is Ancient Greek, documented extensively beginning with the two [[Homeric poems]] (the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'', c. 750 BC).\n* [[Hittite language|Hittite]] (c. 1700\u20131200 BC). This is the earliest-recorded of all Indo-European languages, and highly divergent from the others due to the early separation of the [[Anatolian languages]] from the remainder. It possesses some highly archaic features found only fragmentarily, if at all, in other languages. At the same time, however, it appears to have undergone a large number of early phonological and grammatical changes which, combined with the ambiguities of its writing system, hinder its usefulness somewhat.\n\nOther primary sources:\n* [[Latin]], attested in a huge amount of poetic and prose material in the [[Classical Latin|Classical]] period (c. 200 BC \u2013 100 AD) and limited [[Old Latin|older material]] from as early as c. 600 BC.\n* [[Gothic language|Gothic]] (the most archaic well-documented [[Germanic language]], c. 350 AD), along with the combined witness of the other old Germanic languages: most importantly, [[Old English]] (c. 800\u20131000 AD), [[Old High German]] (c. 750\u20131000 AD) and [[Old Norse]] (c. 1100\u20131300 AD, with limited earlier sources dating all the way back to c. 200 AD).\n* [[Old Avestan]] (c. 1700\u20131200 BC) and [[Avestan language|Younger Avestan]] (c. 900 BC). Documentation is sparse, but nonetheless quite important due to its highly archaic nature.\n* Modern [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], with limited records in [[Old Lithuanian]] (c. 1500\u20131700 AD).\n* [[Old Church Slavonic]] (c. 900\u20131000 AD).\n\nOther secondary sources, of lesser value due to poor attestation:\n* [[Luwian language|Luwian]], [[Lycian language|Lycian]], [[Lydian language|Lydian]] and other [[Anatolian languages]] (c. 1400\u2013400 BC).\n* [[Oscan]], [[Umbrian]] and other [[Italic languages|Old Italic]] languages (c. 600\u2013200 BC).\n* [[Old Persian]] (c. 500 BC).\n* [[Old Prussian]] (c. 1350\u20131600 AD); even more archaic than Lithuanian.\n\nOther secondary sources, of lesser value due to extensive phonological changes and relatively limited attestation:<ref name=\"Beekes2011\">{{cite book|author=Robert S.P.

(The correctness of the terms ''palatal'' and ''plain velar'' is disputed; see [[Proto-Indo-European phonology]].) All daughter languages have reduced the number of distinctions among these sounds, often in divergent ways.\n\nAs an example, in [[English language|English]], one of the [[Germanic language]]s, the following are some of the major changes that happened:\n{{ordered list\n|1= As in other [[centum]] languages, the \"plain velar\" and \"palatal\" stops merged, reducing the number of stops from 15 to 12.\n|2= As in the other Germanic languages, the [[Germanic sound shift]] changed the realization of all stop consonants, with each consonant shifting to a different one:\n: {{PIE|b\u02b0}} \u2192 {{PIE|b}} \u2192 {{PIE|p}} \u2192 {{PIE|f}}\n: {{PIE|d\u02b0}} \u2192 {{PIE|d}} \u2192 {{PIE|t}} \u2192 {{PIE|\u03b8}}\n: {{PIE|g\u02b0}} \u2192 {{PIE|g}} \u2192 {{PIE|k}} \u2192 {{PIE|x}} (Later initial {{PIE|x}} \u2192{{PIE|h}})\n: {{PIE|g\u02b7\u02b0}} \u2192 {{PIE|g\u02b7}} \u2192 {{PIE|k\u02b7}} \u2192 {{PIE|x\u02b7}} (Later initial {{PIE|x\u02b7}} \u2192{{PIE|h\u02b7}})\nEach original consonant shifted one position to the right.  For example, original {{PIE|d\u02b0}} became {{PIE|d}}, while original {{PIE|d}} became {{PIE|t}} and original {{PIE|t}} became {{PIE|\u03b8}} (written ''th'' in English).  This is the original source of the English sounds written ''f'', ''th'', ''h'' and ''wh''.  Examples, comparing English with Latin, where the sounds largely remain unshifted:\n:For PIE ''p'': ''piscis'' vs. ''fish''; ''p\u0113s, p\u0113dis'' vs. ''foot''; ''pluvium'' \"rain\" vs. ''flow''; ''pater'' vs. ''father''\n:For PIE ''t'': ''tr\u0113s'' vs. ''three''; ''m\u0101ter'' vs. ''mother''\n:For PIE ''d'': ''decem'' vs. ''ten''; ''p\u0113dis'' vs. ''foot''; ''quid'' vs. ''what''\n:For PIE ''k'': ''centum'' vs. ''hund(red)''; ''capere'' \"to take\" vs. ''have''\n:For PIE ''k\u02b7'': ''quid'' vs. ''what''; ''quand\u014d'' vs. ''when''\n|3= Various further changes affected consonants in the middle or end of a word:\n* The voiced stops resulting from the sound shift were softened to voiced [[fricative consonant|fricatives]] (or perhaps the sound shift directly generated fricatives in these positions).\n* [[Verner's law]] also turned some of the voiceless fricatives resulting from the sound shift into voiced fricatives or stops.  This is why the ''t'' in Latin ''centum'' ends up as ''d'' in ''hund(red)'' rather than the expected ''th''.\n* Most remaining ''h'' sounds disappeared, while remaining ''f'' and ''th'' became voiced.  For example, Latin ''decem'' ends up as ''ten'' with no ''h'' in the middle (but note ''ta\u00edhun'' \"ten\" in [[Gothic language|Gothic]], an archaic Germanic language).  Similarly, the words ''seven'' and ''have'' have a voiced ''v'' (compare Latin ''septem'', ''capere''), while ''father'' and ''mother'' have a voiced ''th'', although not spelled differently (compare Latin ''pater'', ''m\u0101ter'').\n}}\n\nNone of the daughter-language families (except possibly [[Anatolian languages|Anatolian]], particularly [[Luvian language|Luvian]]) reflect the plain velar stops differently from the other two series, and there is even a certain amount of dispute whether this series existed at all in PIE.  The major distinction between [[Centum-satem isogloss|''centum'' and ''satem'']] languages corresponds to the outcome of the PIE plain velars:\n* The \"central\" ''satem'' languages ([[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]], [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]], and [[Armenian language|Armenian]]) reflect both \"plain velar\" and labiovelar stops as plain velars, often with secondary [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]] before a [[front vowel]] (''e i \u0113 \u012b'').  The \"palatal\" stops are palatalized and often appear as [[sibilant]]s (usually but not always distinct from the secondarily palatalized stops).\n* The \"peripheral\" ''centum'' languages ([[Germanic languages|Germanic]], [[Italic languages|Italic]], [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Anatolian languages|Anatolian]] and [[Tocharian language|Tocharian]]) reflect both \"palatal\" and \"plain velar\" stops as plain velars, while the labiovelars continue unchanged, often with later reduction into plain [[labial consonant|labial]] or [[velar consonant]]s.\n\nThe three-way PIE distinction between voiceless, voiced and voiced aspirated stops is considered extremely unusual from the perspective of [[linguistic typology]]\u2014particularly in the existence of voiced aspirated stops without a corresponding series of voiceless aspirated stops. None of the various daughter-language families continue it unchanged, with numerous \"solutions\" to the apparently unstable PIE situation:\n* The [[Indo-Aryan language]]s preserve the three series unchanged but have evolved a fourth series of voiceless aspirated consonants.\n* The [[Iranian language]]s probably passed through the same stage, subsequently changing the aspirated stops into fricatives.\n* [[Greek language|Greek]] converted the voiced aspirates into voiceless aspirates.\n* [[Italic languages|Italic]] probably passed through the same stage, but reflects the voiced aspirates as voiceless fricatives, especially ''f'' (or sometimes plain voiced stops in [[Latin]]).\n* [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]], [[Anatolian languages|Anatolian]], and [[Albanian language|Albanian]] merge the voiced aspirated into plain voiced stops.\n* [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] and [[Armenian language|Armenian]] change all three series in a [[chain shift]] (e.g. with ''bh b p'' becoming ''b p f'' (known as ''[[Grimm's law]]'' in Germanic).\n\nAmong the other notable changes affecting consonants are:\n* The [[Ruki sound law]] (''s'' becomes {{IPA|/\u0283/}} before ''r, u, k, i'') in the ''[[satem]]'' languages.\n* Loss of prevocalic ''p'' in [[Proto-Celtic]].\n* Development of prevocalic ''s'' to ''h'' in [[Proto-Greek]], with later loss of ''h'' between vowels.\n* [[Verner's law]] in [[Proto-Germanic]].\n* [[Grassmann's law]] (dissimilation of aspirates) independently in Proto-Greek and Proto-Indo-Iranian.\n\nThe following table shows the basic outcomes of PIE consonants in some of the most important daughter languages for the purposes of reconstruction.

Some IE languages have moved from [[synthetic language|synthetic]] verb systems to largely [[periphrasis|periphrastic]] systems. In addition, the [[pronoun]]s of periphrastic forms are in brackets when they appear. Some of these verbs have undergone a change in meaning as well.\n* In Modern Irish ''beir'' usually only carries the meaning ''to bear'' in the sense of bearing a child; its common meanings are ''to catch, grab''.\n* The Hindi verb ''bharn\u0101'', the continuation of the Sanskrit verb, can have a variety of meanings, but the most common is \"to fill\". The forms given in the table, although etymologically derived from the present indicative, now have the meaning of [[Subjunctive mood|subjunctive]].  The present indicative is conjugated periphrastically, using a participle (etymologically the Sanskrit present participle ''bharant-'') and an auxiliary: ''mai\u1e43 bhart\u0101 h\u016b\u1e43, t\u016b bhart\u0101 hai, vah bhart\u0101 hai, ham bharte hai\u1e43, tum bharte ho, ve bharte hai\u1e43'' (masculine forms).\n* German is not directly descended from Gothic, but the Gothic forms are a close approximation of what the early West Germanic forms of c. 400 AD would have looked like.  The cognate of Germanic ''beranan'' (English ''bear'') survives in German only in the compound ''geb\u00e4ren'', meaning \"bear (a child)\".\n* The Latin verb ''ferre'' is irregular, and not a good representative of a normal thematic verb. In most Romance Languages such as French, other verbs now mean \"to carry\" (e.g. Fr. ''porter'' < Lat. ''portare'') and ''ferre'' was only borrowed and nativized in compounds such as ''souffrir'' \"to suffer\" (from Latin ''sub-'' and ''ferre'') and {{lang|fr|conf\u00e9rer}} \"to confer\" (from Latin \"con-\" and \"ferre\").\n* In Modern [[Greek language|Greek]], ''phero'' \u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9 (modern transliteration ''fero'') \"to bear\" is still used but only in specific contexts and is most common in such compounds as \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9, \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9, \u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9, \u03b5\u03ba\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9, \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9, \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9, \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9, \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9 etc. The form that is (very) common today is ''pherno'' \u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03bd\u03c9 (modern transliteration ''ferno'') meaning \"to bring\". Additionally, the perfective form of ''pherno'' (used for the subjunctive voice and also for the future tense) is also ''phero''.\n* In Modern [[Russian language|Russian]] ''\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c'' (brat') carries the meaning ''to take''. ''\u0411\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f'' (br'em'a) means ''burden'', as something heavy to bear, and derivative ''\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c'' (b'er'em'ennost') means ''pregnancy''.\n\n== Comparison of cognates ==\n{{Main|Indo-European vocabulary}}\n{{See also|Proto-Indo-European numerals|List of numbers in various languages}}\n\n==Present distribution==\n[[File:Indo-European-speaking world.png|thumb|left|upright=1.55|{{legend|#013857|Official or Primary Language}}{{legend|#0371b0|Secondary Official Language}}{{legend|#80a4c0|Recognized}}{{legend|#ccd2e8|Significant}}{{legend|#e5e5e5|No use}}]]\n\n[[File:Languages of North America.svg|thumb|upright=0.95|The approximate present-day distribution of Indo-European languages within the Americas by country:<br />\n[[Romance languages|Romance]]:\n{{legend|#3EBA00|[[Spanish language|Spanish]]}}\n{{legend|#EA6500|[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]\u2013[[Galician language|Galician]]}}\n{{legend|#001E96|[[French language|French]]}}\n[[Germanic languages|Germanic]]:\n{{legend|#C60000|[[English language|English]]}}\n{{legend|#FFD000|[[Dutch language|Dutch]]}} ]]\nToday, Indo-European languages are spoken by 3.2 billion [[Native speaker#Defining \"native speaker\"|native speakers]] across all inhabited continents,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/ethno_docs/distribution.asp?by=family |title=Ethnologue list of language families |publisher=Ethnologue.com |edition=22th |date= |accessdate=2019-07-02}}</ref> the largest number by far for any recognised language family.

The ancient [[Indo-European migrations]] and widespread dissemination of [[Indo-European culture]] throughout [[Eurasia]], including that of the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]] themselves, and that of their daughter cultures including the [[Indo-Aryan migration theory|Indo-Aryans]], [[Iranian peoples]], [[Celts]], [[Hellenistic period|Greeks]], [[Roman Empire|Romans]], [[Germanic peoples]], and [[Slavs]], led to these peoples' branches of the language family already taking a dominant foothold in virtually all of [[Eurasia]] except for swathes of the [[Near East]], [[North Asia|North]] and [[East Asia]], replacing many (but not all) of the previously-spoken [[pre-Indo-European languages]] of this extensive area. However [[Semitic languages]] remain dominant in much of the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]], and [[Languages of the Caucasus|Caucasian languages]] in much of the [[Caucasus]] region. Similarly in [[Europe]] and the [[Urals]] the [[Uralic languages]] (such as Hungarian, Finnish, Estonian etc) remain, as does [[Basque language|Basque]], a pre-Indo-European Isolate.\n\nDespite being unaware of their common linguistic origin, diverse groups of Indo-European speakers continued to culturally dominate and often replace the indigenous languages of the western two-thirds of Eurasia. By the beginning of the [[Common Era]], Indo-European peoples controlled almost the entirety of this area: the Celts western and central Europe, the Romans southern Europe, the Germanic peoples northern Europe, the Slavs eastern Europe, the Iranian peoples most of western and central Asia and parts of eastern Europe, and the Indo-Aryan peoples in the [[Indian subcontinent]], with the [[Tocharians]] inhabiting the Indo-European frontier in western China. By the medieval period, only the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]], [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]], [[Languages of the Caucasus|Caucasian]], and [[Uralic languages]], and the [[language isolate]] [[Basque language|Basque]] remained of the (relatively) [[Paleo-European languages|indigenous languages of Europe]] and the western half of Asia.\n\nDespite medieval invasions by [[Eurasian nomads]], a group to which the Proto-Indo-Europeans had once belonged, Indo-European expansion reached another peak in the [[early modern period]] with the dramatic increase in the population of the [[Indian subcontinent]] and European expansionism throughout the globe during the [[Age of Discovery]], as well as the continued replacement and assimilation of surrounding non-Indo-European languages and peoples due to increased state centralization and [[nationalism]]. These trends compounded throughout the modern period due to the general global [[population growth]] and the results of [[European colonization]] of the [[Western Hemisphere]] and [[Oceania]], leading to an explosion in the number of Indo-European speakers as well as the territories inhabited by them.\n\nDue to colonization and the modern dominance of Indo-European languages in the fields of politics, global science, technology, education, finance, and sports, even many modern countries whose populations largely speak non-Indo-European languages have Indo-European languages as official languages, and the majority of the global population speaks at least one Indo-European language. The overwhelming majority of [[languages used on the Internet]] are Indo-European, with [[English language|English]] continuing to lead the group; English in general has in many respects [[English as a lingua franca|become the ''lingua franca'']] of global communication.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==See also==\n{{col div|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Grammatical conjugation]]\n* ''[[The Horse, the Wheel, and Language]]'' (book)\n* [[Indo-European copula]]\n* [[Indo-European sound laws]]\n* [[Indo-European studies]]\n* [[Indo-Semitic languages]]\n* [[Indo-Uralic languages]]\n* [[Eurasiatic languages]]\n* [[Language family]]\n* [[Languages of Asia]]\n* [[Languages of Europe]]\n* [[Languages of India]]\n* [[List of Indo-European languages]]\n* [[Proto-Indo-European root]]\n* [[Proto-Indo-European religion]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book | last = Anthony | first = David W. | title = The Horse, the Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World | publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 2007 | isbn =978-0-691-05887-0 | ref = harv }}\n* {{cite book |last=Auroux |first=Sylvain |title=History of the Language Sciences |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |location=Berlin |year=2000 |isbn=978-3-11-016735-1 }}\n* {{cite book | last=Fortson | first=Benjamin W. | title=Indo-European Language and Culture: An Introduction |location=Malden, Massachusetts | publisher=Blackwell | year=2004 | isbn=978-1-4051-0315-2 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |title=Grundriss der Vergleichenden Grammatik der indogermanischen Sprachen |first=Karl |last=Brugmann |author-link=Karl Brugmann |language=de |volume=Erster Band |location=Strassburg |publisher=Karl J.

It comprises most of the languages of Europe together with those of the northern [[Indian Subcontinent]] and the [[Iranian Plateau]]. A few of these languages, such as English, have expanded through [[colonialism]] in the modern period and are now spoken across all continents. The Indo-European family is divided into several branches or sub-families, the largest of which are the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]], [[Germanic language|Germanic]], [[Romance languages|Romance]], and [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]] groups. The most populous individual languages within them are [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[English language|English]], [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] ([[Hindi]]/[[Urdu]]), [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], and [[Russian language|Russian]], each with over 100 million speakers. [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Persian language|Persian]] have more than 50 million each. In total, 46% of the world's population (3.2 billion) speaks an Indo-European language as a first language, by far the highest of any language family. There are about 445 living Indo-European languages, according to the estimate by ''[[Ethnologue]]'', with over two thirds (313) of them belonging to the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian branch]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=2-16|title=Ethnologue report for Indo-European|publisher=Ethnologue.com}}</ref> \n\nAll Indo-European languages are descendants of a single prehistoric language, [[Linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] as [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]], spoken sometime in the [[Neolithic]] era. Its precise geographical location, the Indo-European [[Proto-Indo-European Urheimat hypotheses|''urheimat'']], is unknown and has been the object of many competing hypotheses. By the time the first written records appeared, Indo-European had already spread out into a large number of languages spoken across much of Europe and south-west Asia. Written evidence of Indo-European appeared during the [[Bronze Age]] in the form of [[Mycenaean Greek]] and the [[Anatolian languages]], [[Hittite language|Hittite]] and [[Luwian language|Luwian]]. The oldest records are isolated Hittite words and names \u2013 interspersed in texts that are otherwise in the unrelated [[Akkadian language|Old Assyrian]] language, a [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] language \u2013 found in the texts of the Assyrian colony of [[K\u00fcltepe]] in eastern Anatolia in the 20th century BC.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bryce |first=Trevor |date= 2005|title=Kingdom of the Hittites: New Edition |url= |location= |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=37 |isbn=978-0-19-928132-9 |access-date= }}</ref> Although no older written records of the original [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]] remain, some aspects of their culture and [[Proto-Indo-European religion|religion]] can be reconstructed from later evidence in the daughter cultures.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Introduction to Proto-Indo-European and the Proto-Indo-European World|last=Mallory|first=J.

The analysis of the family relationships between the Indo-European languages and the reconstruction of their common source was central to the development of the methodology of historical linguistics as an academic discipline in the 19th century.\n\nThe Indo-European family is not known to be linked to any other language family through any more distant genetic relationship, although several [[#Suggested macrofamilies|disputed proposals]] to that effect have been made. \n\nDuring the nineteenth century, the linguistic concept of Indo-European languages was frequently used interchangeably with the racial concepts of [[Aryan race|Aryan]] and [[Japhetite]].<ref name=\"Kidd2006\">{{cite book|author=Colin Kidd|title=The Forging of Races: Race and Scripture in the Protestant Atlantic World, 1600\u20132000|url={{Google books|aNT3q1HjY_MC|page=PA23|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-45753-8|pages=23\u2013}}</ref>\n\n==History of Indo-European linguistics==\n{{See also|Indo-European studies#History}}\nIn the 16th century, European visitors to the [[Indian subcontinent]] began to notice similarities among [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]], [[Iranian languages|Iranian]], and [[languages of Europe|European]] languages.

Membership in the various branches, groups and subgroups of Indo-European is also genealogical, but here the defining factors are ''shared innovations'' among various languages, suggesting a common ancestor that split off from other Indo-European groups. For example, what makes the Germanic languages a branch of Indo-European is that much of their structure and phonology can be stated in rules that apply to all of them. Many of their common features are presumed innovations that took place in [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]], the source of all the Germanic languages.\n\n===Tree versus wave model===\n{{See also|Language change}}\nThe \"[[tree model]]\" is considered an appropriate representation of the genealogical history of a language family if communities do not remain in contact after their languages have started to diverge. In this case, subgroups defined by shared innovations form a nested pattern. The tree model is not appropriate in cases where languages remain in contact as they diversify; in such cases subgroups may overlap, and the \"[[Wave model (linguistics)|wave model]]\" is a more accurate representation.<ref>{{Citation\n  | last = Fran\u00e7ois\n  | first = Alexandre\n  | contribution = Trees, Waves and Linkages: Models of Language Diversification\n  | editor1-last = Bowern\n  | editor1-first = Claire\n  | editor2-last = Evans\n  | editor2-first = Bethwyn\n  | title = The Routledge Handbook of Historical Linguistics\n  | series=\n  | pages = 161\u201389\n  | publisher = Routledge\n  | place = London\n  | year = 2014\n  | isbn = 978-0-415-52789-7\n  | contribution-url = http://alex.francois.free.fr/data/AlexFrancois_2014_HHL_Trees-waves-linkages_Diversification.pdf\n  | ref = francois\n }}</ref> Most approaches to Indo-European subgrouping to date have assumed that the tree model is by-and-large valid for Indo-European;<ref>{{cite journal | title= From August Schleicher to Sergei Starostin: on the development of the tree-diagram models of the Indo-European languages | author= Bla\u017eek, V\u00e1clav | journal= Journal of Indo-European Studies | year= 2007 | volume= 35 | issue= 1\u20132 | pages= 82\u2013109}}</ref> however, there is also a long tradition of wave-model approaches.<ref>{{cite book | title= Les dialectes indo-europ\u00e9ens | publisher= Honor\u00e9 Champion | author= Meillet, Antoine | year= 1908 | location= Paris}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title= I dialetti indoeuropei | publisher= Paideia | author= Bonfante, Giuliano | year= 1931 | location= Brescia}}</ref>{{sfn|Porzig|1954}}\n\nIn addition to genealogical changes, many of the early changes in Indo-European languages can be attributed to [[language contact]]. It has been asserted, for example, that many of the more striking features shared by Italic languages (Latin, Oscan, Umbrian, etc.) might well be [[Areal feature (linguistics)|areal features]]. More certainly, very similar-looking alterations in the systems of [[long vowel]]s in the West Germanic languages greatly postdate any possible notion of a [[proto-language]] innovation (and cannot readily be regarded as \"areal\", either, because English and continental West Germanic were not a linguistic area). In a similar vein, there are many similar innovations in Germanic and Balto-Slavic that are far more likely areal features than traceable to a common proto-language, such as the uniform development of a [[high vowel]] (*''u'' in the case of Germanic, *''i/u'' in the case of Baltic and Slavic) before the PIE syllabic resonants *''\u1e5b, *\u1e37, *\u1e43, *\u1e47'', unique to these two groups among IE languages, which is in agreement with the wave model. The [[Balkan sprachbund]] even features areal convergence among members of very different branches.\n\nAn extension to the ''[[Donald Ringe|Ringe]]-[[Tandy Warnow|Warnow]] model of language evolution'', suggests that early IE had featured limited contact between distinct lineages, with only the Germanic subfamily exhibiting a less treelike behaviour as it acquired some characteristics from neighbours early in its evolution. The internal diversification of especially West Germanic is cited to have been radically non-treelike.<ref>{{Cite journal |url= http://www.cs.rice.edu/~nakhleh/Papers/NRWlanguage.pdf |title= Perfect Phylogenetic Networks: A New Methodology for Reconstructing the Evolutionary History of Natural Languages |first= Luay |last= Nakhleh |first2= Don |last2= Ringe |lastauthoramp= yes |first3= Tandy |last3= Warnow|author3-link= Tandy Warnow |year= 2005 |journal= Language |volume= 81 |issue= 2 |pages= 382\u2013420 |doi= 10.1353/lan.2005.0078 |postscript= <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

According to another view, the Anatolian subgroup left the Indo-European parent language comparatively late, approximately at the same time as Indo-Iranian and later than the Greek or Armenian divisions. A third view, especially prevalent in the so-called French school of Indo-European studies, holds that extant similarities in non-[[satem]] languages in general\u2014including Anatolian\u2014might be due to their peripheral location in the Indo-European language-area and to early separation, rather than indicating a special ancestral relationship.<ref>''Britannica'' 15th edition, 22 p. 594, \"Indo-Hittite hypothesis\"</ref> Hans J.

In the satem languages, which include the Balto-Slavic and Indo-Iranian branches, as well as (in most respects) Albanian and Armenian, the reconstructed [[Proto-Indo-European phonology#Consonants|Proto-Indo-European palatovelars]] remained distinct and were fricativized, while the labiovelars merged with the 'plain velars.' In the centum languages, the palatovelars merged with the plain velars, while the labiovelars remained distinct. The results of these alternative developments are exemplified by the words for \"hundred\" in Avestan (''satem'') and Latin (''centum'')\u2014the initial palatovelar developed into a fricative [s] in the former, but became an ordinary velar [k] in the latter.\n\nRather than being a genealogical separation, the centum\u2013satem division is commonly seen as resulting from innovative changes that spread across PIE dialect-branches over a particular geographical area; the centum\u2013satem [[isogloss]] intersects a number of other isoglosses that mark distinctions between features in the early IE branches. It may be that the centum branches in fact reflect the original state of affairs in PIE, and only the satem branches shared a set of innovations, which affected all but the peripheral areas of the PIE dialect continuum.<ref>''Britannica'' 15th edition, vol.22, 1981, pp. 588, 594</ref> Kortlandt proposes that the ancestors of Balts and Slavs took part in satemization before being drawn later into the western Indo-European sphere.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.kortlandt.nl/publications/art111e.pdf |first= Frederik |last= Kortlandt |title= The spread of the Indo-Europeans |year= 1989 |accessdate= 2010-08-07}}</ref>\n\n===Suggested macrofamilies===\n\nSome linguists propose that Indo-European languages form part of one of several hypothetical [[macrofamily|macrofamilies]].

Some of the smaller proposed macrofamilies include:\n* [[Pontic languages|Pontic]], postulated by [[John Colarusso]], which joins Indo-European with [[Northwest Caucasian languages|Northwest Caucasian]]\n* [[Indo-Uralic languages|Indo-Uralic]], joining Indo-European with [[Uralic languages|Uralic]]\n\nOther, greater proposed families including Indo-European languages, include:\n* [[Eurasiatic languages|Eurasiatic]], a theory championed by [[Joseph Greenberg]], comprising the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]], [[Altaic languages|Altaic]] and various '[[Paleosiberian languages|Paleosiberian]]' families ([[Ainu language|Ainu]], [[Yukaghir languages|Yukaghir]], [[Nivkh languages|Nivkh]], [[Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages|Chukotko-Kamchatkan]], [[Eskimo-Aleut languages|Eskimo-Aleut]]) and possibly others\n* [[Nostratic languages|Nostratic]], comprising all or some of the Eurasiatic languages as well as the [[Kartvelian languages|Kartvelian]], [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] (or wider, [[Elamo-Dravidian languages|Elamo-Dravidian]]) and [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] language families\n\nObjections to such groupings are not based on any theoretical claim about the likely historical existence or non-existence of such macrofamilies; it is entirely reasonable to suppose that they might have existed. The serious difficulty lies in identifying the details of actual relationships between language families, because it is very hard to find concrete evidence that transcends chance resemblance, or is not equally likely explained as being due to [[loanword|borrowing]] (including [[Wanderwort|Wanderw\u00f6rter]], which can travel very long distances). Because the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] in historical linguistics declines over time, at great enough time-depths it becomes open to reasonable doubt that one can even distinguish between signal and noise.\n\n==Evolution==\n\n===Proto-Indo-European===\n{{Main|Proto-Indo-European language}}\n[[File:IE expansion.png|upright=0.9|thumb|Scheme of Indo-European migrations from ca. 4000 to 1000 BC according to the [[Kurgan hypothesis]].]]\nThe proposed Proto-Indo-European language (PIE) is the [[Comparative method|reconstructed]] common ancestor of the Indo-European languages, spoken by the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]]. From the 1960s, knowledge of Anatolian became certain enough to establish its relationship to PIE. Using the method of [[internal reconstruction]] an earlier stage, called Pre-Proto-Indo-European, has been proposed.\n\nPIE was an [[inflected language]], in which the grammatical relationships between words were signaled through inflectional morphemes (usually endings). The [[root (linguistics)|roots]] of PIE are basic [[morpheme]]s carrying a [[lexical (semiotics)|lexical]] meaning. By addition of [[suffix]]es, they form [[stem (linguistics)|stems]], and by addition of [[Ending (linguistics)|endings]], these form grammatically inflected words ([[Indo-European noun|nouns]] or [[Indo-European verb|verbs]]). The reconstructed [[Indo-European verb]] system is complex and, like the noun, exhibits a system of [[Indo-European ablaut|ablaut]].\n\n===Diversification===\n{{See also|Indo-European migrations}}\n{{Gallery\n|title=Possible expansion of Indo-European languages according to the Kurgan hypothesis\n|width=180 | height=100\n|align=center\n|footer=\n|File:IE5500BP.png\n |alt1=IE languages 3500 BC\n |IE languages c. 3500 BC\n|File:IE4500BP.png\n |alt2=IE languages 2500 BC\n |IE languages c. 2500 BC\n|File:IE3500BP.png\n |alt3=IE languages 1500 BC\n |IE languages c. 1500 BC\n|File:IE1500BP.png\n |alt4=IE languages 500 AD\n |IE languages c. 500 AD\n}}\nThe diversification of the parent language into the attested branches of daughter languages is historically unattested.

These generally include the ancient Indo-European languages that are both well-attested and documented at an early date, although some languages from later periods are important if they are particularly [[conservative (language)|linguistically conservative]] (most notably, [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]). Early poetry is of special significance because of the rigid [[poetic meter]] normally employed, which makes it possible to reconstruct a number of features (e.g. [[vowel length]]) that were either unwritten or corrupted in the process of transmission down to the earliest extant written [[manuscript]]s.\n\nMost noticeable of all:<ref name=\"Beekes2011One\">{{cite book|author=Robert S.P.

This language is unique in that its source documents were all composed orally, and were passed down through [[oral tradition]] ([[shakha]] schools) for c. 2,000 years before ever being written down. The oldest documents are all in poetic form; oldest and most important of all is the [[Rigveda]] (c. 1500 BC).\n* [[Ancient Greek]] (c. 750\u2013400 BC). [[Mycenaean Greek]] (c. 1450 BC) is the oldest recorded form, but its value is lessened by the limited material, restricted subject matter, and highly ambiguous writing system. More important is Ancient Greek, documented extensively beginning with the two [[Homeric poems]] (the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'', c. 750 BC).\n* [[Hittite language|Hittite]] (c. 1700\u20131200 BC). This is the earliest-recorded of all Indo-European languages, and highly divergent from the others due to the early separation of the [[Anatolian languages]] from the remainder. It possesses some highly archaic features found only fragmentarily, if at all, in other languages. At the same time, however, it appears to have undergone a large number of early phonological and grammatical changes which, combined with the ambiguities of its writing system, hinder its usefulness somewhat.\n\nOther primary sources:\n* [[Latin]], attested in a huge amount of poetic and prose material in the [[Classical Latin|Classical]] period (c. 200 BC \u2013 100 AD) and limited [[Old Latin|older material]] from as early as c. 600 BC.\n* [[Gothic language|Gothic]] (the most archaic well-documented [[Germanic language]], c. 350 AD), along with the combined witness of the other old Germanic languages: most importantly, [[Old English]] (c. 800\u20131000 AD), [[Old High German]] (c. 750\u20131000 AD) and [[Old Norse]] (c. 1100\u20131300 AD, with limited earlier sources dating all the way back to c. 200 AD).\n* [[Old Avestan]] (c. 1700\u20131200 BC) and [[Avestan language|Younger Avestan]] (c. 900 BC). Documentation is sparse, but nonetheless quite important due to its highly archaic nature.\n* Modern [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], with limited records in [[Old Lithuanian]] (c. 1500\u20131700 AD).\n* [[Old Church Slavonic]] (c. 900\u20131000 AD).\n\nOther secondary sources, of lesser value due to poor attestation:\n* [[Luwian language|Luwian]], [[Lycian language|Lycian]], [[Lydian language|Lydian]] and other [[Anatolian languages]] (c. 1400\u2013400 BC).\n* [[Oscan]], [[Umbrian]] and other [[Italic languages|Old Italic]] languages (c. 600\u2013200 BC).\n* [[Old Persian]] (c. 500 BC).\n* [[Old Prussian]] (c. 1350\u20131600 AD); even more archaic than Lithuanian.\n\nOther secondary sources, of lesser value due to extensive phonological changes and relatively limited attestation:<ref name=\"Beekes2011\">{{cite book|author=Robert S.P.

(The correctness of the terms ''palatal'' and ''plain velar'' is disputed; see [[Proto-Indo-European phonology]].) All daughter languages have reduced the number of distinctions among these sounds, often in divergent ways.\n\nAs an example, in [[English language|English]], one of the [[Germanic language]]s, the following are some of the major changes that happened:\n{{ordered list\n|1= As in other [[centum]] languages, the \"plain velar\" and \"palatal\" stops merged, reducing the number of stops from 15 to 12.\n|2= As in the other Germanic languages, the [[Germanic sound shift]] changed the realization of all stop consonants, with each consonant shifting to a different one:\n: {{PIE|b\u02b0}} \u2192 {{PIE|b}} \u2192 {{PIE|p}} \u2192 {{PIE|f}}\n: {{PIE|d\u02b0}} \u2192 {{PIE|d}} \u2192 {{PIE|t}} \u2192 {{PIE|\u03b8}}\n: {{PIE|g\u02b0}} \u2192 {{PIE|g}} \u2192 {{PIE|k}} \u2192 {{PIE|x}} (Later initial {{PIE|x}} \u2192{{PIE|h}})\n: {{PIE|g\u02b7\u02b0}} \u2192 {{PIE|g\u02b7}} \u2192 {{PIE|k\u02b7}} \u2192 {{PIE|x\u02b7}} (Later initial {{PIE|x\u02b7}} \u2192{{PIE|h\u02b7}})\nEach original consonant shifted one position to the right.  For example, original {{PIE|d\u02b0}} became {{PIE|d}}, while original {{PIE|d}} became {{PIE|t}} and original {{PIE|t}} became {{PIE|\u03b8}} (written ''th'' in English).  This is the original source of the English sounds written ''f'', ''th'', ''h'' and ''wh''.  Examples, comparing English with Latin, where the sounds largely remain unshifted:\n:For PIE ''p'': ''piscis'' vs. ''fish''; ''p\u0113s, p\u0113dis'' vs. ''foot''; ''pluvium'' \"rain\" vs. ''flow''; ''pater'' vs. ''father''\n:For PIE ''t'': ''tr\u0113s'' vs. ''three''; ''m\u0101ter'' vs. ''mother''\n:For PIE ''d'': ''decem'' vs. ''ten''; ''p\u0113dis'' vs. ''foot''; ''quid'' vs. ''what''\n:For PIE ''k'': ''centum'' vs. ''hund(red)''; ''capere'' \"to take\" vs. ''have''\n:For PIE ''k\u02b7'': ''quid'' vs. ''what''; ''quand\u014d'' vs. ''when''\n|3= Various further changes affected consonants in the middle or end of a word:\n* The voiced stops resulting from the sound shift were softened to voiced [[fricative consonant|fricatives]] (or perhaps the sound shift directly generated fricatives in these positions).\n* [[Verner's law]] also turned some of the voiceless fricatives resulting from the sound shift into voiced fricatives or stops.  This is why the ''t'' in Latin ''centum'' ends up as ''d'' in ''hund(red)'' rather than the expected ''th''.\n* Most remaining ''h'' sounds disappeared, while remaining ''f'' and ''th'' became voiced.  For example, Latin ''decem'' ends up as ''ten'' with no ''h'' in the middle (but note ''ta\u00edhun'' \"ten\" in [[Gothic language|Gothic]], an archaic Germanic language).  Similarly, the words ''seven'' and ''have'' have a voiced ''v'' (compare Latin ''septem'', ''capere''), while ''father'' and ''mother'' have a voiced ''th'', although not spelled differently (compare Latin ''pater'', ''m\u0101ter'').\n}}\n\nNone of the daughter-language families (except possibly [[Anatolian languages|Anatolian]], particularly [[Luvian language|Luvian]]) reflect the plain velar stops differently from the other two series, and there is even a certain amount of dispute whether this series existed at all in PIE.  The major distinction between [[Centum-satem isogloss|''centum'' and ''satem'']] languages corresponds to the outcome of the PIE plain velars:\n* The \"central\" ''satem'' languages ([[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]], [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]], and [[Armenian language|Armenian]]) reflect both \"plain velar\" and labiovelar stops as plain velars, often with secondary [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]] before a [[front vowel]] (''e i \u0113 \u012b'').  The \"palatal\" stops are palatalized and often appear as [[sibilant]]s (usually but not always distinct from the secondarily palatalized stops).\n* The \"peripheral\" ''centum'' languages ([[Germanic languages|Germanic]], [[Italic languages|Italic]], [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Anatolian languages|Anatolian]] and [[Tocharian language|Tocharian]]) reflect both \"palatal\" and \"plain velar\" stops as plain velars, while the labiovelars continue unchanged, often with later reduction into plain [[labial consonant|labial]] or [[velar consonant]]s.\n\nThe three-way PIE distinction between voiceless, voiced and voiced aspirated stops is considered extremely unusual from the perspective of [[linguistic typology]]\u2014particularly in the existence of voiced aspirated stops without a corresponding series of voiceless aspirated stops. None of the various daughter-language families continue it unchanged, with numerous \"solutions\" to the apparently unstable PIE situation:\n* The [[Indo-Aryan language]]s preserve the three series unchanged but have evolved a fourth series of voiceless aspirated consonants.\n* The [[Iranian language]]s probably passed through the same stage, subsequently changing the aspirated stops into fricatives.\n* [[Greek language|Greek]] converted the voiced aspirates into voiceless aspirates.\n* [[Italic languages|Italic]] probably passed through the same stage, but reflects the voiced aspirates as voiceless fricatives, especially ''f'' (or sometimes plain voiced stops in [[Latin]]).\n* [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]], [[Anatolian languages|Anatolian]], and [[Albanian language|Albanian]] merge the voiced aspirated into plain voiced stops.\n* [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] and [[Armenian language|Armenian]] change all three series in a [[chain shift]] (e.g. with ''bh b p'' becoming ''b p f'' (known as ''[[Grimm's law]]'' in Germanic).\n\nAmong the other notable changes affecting consonants are:\n* The [[Ruki sound law]] (''s'' becomes {{IPA|/\u0283/}} before ''r, u, k, i'') in the ''[[satem]]'' languages.\n* Loss of prevocalic ''p'' in [[Proto-Celtic]].\n* Development of prevocalic ''s'' to ''h'' in [[Proto-Greek]], with later loss of ''h'' between vowels.\n* [[Verner's law]] in [[Proto-Germanic]].\n* [[Grassmann's law]] (dissimilation of aspirates) independently in Proto-Greek and Proto-Indo-Iranian.\n\nThe following table shows the basic outcomes of PIE consonants in some of the most important daughter languages for the purposes of reconstruction.

Some IE languages have moved from [[synthetic language|synthetic]] verb systems to largely [[periphrasis|periphrastic]] systems. In addition, the [[pronoun]]s of periphrastic forms are in brackets when they appear. Some of these verbs have undergone a change in meaning as well.\n* In Modern Irish ''beir'' usually only carries the meaning ''to bear'' in the sense of bearing a child; its common meanings are ''to catch, grab''.\n* The Hindi verb ''bharn\u0101'', the continuation of the Sanskrit verb, can have a variety of meanings, but the most common is \"to fill\". The forms given in the table, although etymologically derived from the present indicative, now have the meaning of [[Subjunctive mood|subjunctive]].  The present indicative is conjugated periphrastically, using a participle (etymologically the Sanskrit present participle ''bharant-'') and an auxiliary: ''mai\u1e43 bhart\u0101 h\u016b\u1e43, t\u016b bhart\u0101 hai, vah bhart\u0101 hai, ham bharte hai\u1e43, tum bharte ho, ve bharte hai\u1e43'' (masculine forms).\n* German is not directly descended from Gothic, but the Gothic forms are a close approximation of what the early West Germanic forms of c. 400 AD would have looked like.  The cognate of Germanic ''beranan'' (English ''bear'') survives in German only in the compound ''geb\u00e4ren'', meaning \"bear (a child)\".\n* The Latin verb ''ferre'' is irregular, and not a good representative of a normal thematic verb. In most Romance Languages such as French, other verbs now mean \"to carry\" (e.g. Fr. ''porter'' < Lat. ''portare'') and ''ferre'' was only borrowed and nativized in compounds such as ''souffrir'' \"to suffer\" (from Latin ''sub-'' and ''ferre'') and {{lang|fr|conf\u00e9rer}} \"to confer\" (from Latin \"con-\" and \"ferre\").\n* In Modern [[Greek language|Greek]], ''phero'' \u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9 (modern transliteration ''fero'') \"to bear\" is still used but only in specific contexts and is most common in such compounds as \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9, \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9, \u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9, \u03b5\u03ba\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9, \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9, \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9, \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9, \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9 etc. The form that is (very) common today is ''pherno'' \u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03bd\u03c9 (modern transliteration ''ferno'') meaning \"to bring\". Additionally, the perfective form of ''pherno'' (used for the subjunctive voice and also for the future tense) is also ''phero''.\n* In Modern [[Russian language|Russian]] ''\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c'' (brat') carries the meaning ''to take''. ''\u0411\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f'' (br'em'a) means ''burden'', as something heavy to bear, and derivative ''\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c'' (b'er'em'ennost') means ''pregnancy''.\n\n== Comparison of cognates ==\n{{Main|Indo-European vocabulary}}\n{{See also|Proto-Indo-European numerals|List of numbers in various languages}}\n\n==Present distribution==\n[[File:Indo-European-speaking world.png|thumb|left|upright=1.55|{{legend|#013857|Official or Primary Language}}{{legend|#0371b0|Secondary Official Language}}{{legend|#80a4c0|Recognized}}{{legend|#ccd2e8|Significant}}{{legend|#e5e5e5|No use}}]]\n\n[[File:Languages of North America.svg|thumb|upright=0.95|The approximate present-day distribution of Indo-European languages within the Americas by country:<br />\n[[Romance languages|Romance]]:\n{{legend|#3EBA00|[[Spanish language|Spanish]]}}\n{{legend|#EA6500|[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]\u2013[[Galician language|Galician]]}}\n{{legend|#001E96|[[French language|French]]}}\n[[Germanic languages|Germanic]]:\n{{legend|#C60000|[[English language|English]]}}\n{{legend|#FFD000|[[Dutch language|Dutch]]}} ]]\nToday, Indo-European languages are spoken by 3.2 billion [[Native speaker#Defining \"native speaker\"|native speakers]] across all inhabited continents,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/ethno_docs/distribution.asp?by=family |title=Ethnologue list of language families |publisher=Ethnologue.com |edition=22th |date= |accessdate=2019-07-02}}</ref> the largest number by far for any recognised language family.

The ancient [[Indo-European migrations]] and widespread dissemination of [[Indo-European culture]] throughout [[Eurasia]], including that of the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]] themselves, and that of their daughter cultures including the [[Indo-Aryan migration theory|Indo-Aryans]], [[Iranian peoples]], [[Celts]], [[Hellenistic period|Greeks]], [[Roman Empire|Romans]], [[Germanic peoples]], and [[Slavs]], led to these peoples' branches of the language family already taking a dominant foothold in virtually all of [[Eurasia]] except for swathes of the [[Near East]], [[North Asia|North]] and [[East Asia]], replacing many (but not all) of the previously-spoken [[pre-Indo-European languages]] of this extensive area. However [[Semitic languages]] remain dominant in much of the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]], and [[Languages of the Caucasus|Caucasian languages]] in much of the [[Caucasus]] region. Similarly in [[Europe]] and the [[Urals]] the [[Uralic languages]] (such as Hungarian, Finnish, Estonian etc) remain, as does [[Basque language|Basque]], a pre-Indo-European Isolate.\n\nDespite being unaware of their common linguistic origin, diverse groups of Indo-European speakers continued to culturally dominate and often replace the indigenous languages of the western two-thirds of Eurasia. By the beginning of the [[Common Era]], Indo-European peoples controlled almost the entirety of this area: the Celts western and central Europe, the Romans southern Europe, the Germanic peoples northern Europe, the Slavs eastern Europe, the Iranian peoples most of western and central Asia and parts of eastern Europe, and the Indo-Aryan peoples in the [[Indian subcontinent]], with the [[Tocharians]] inhabiting the Indo-European frontier in western China. By the medieval period, only the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]], [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]], [[Languages of the Caucasus|Caucasian]], and [[Uralic languages]], and the [[language isolate]] [[Basque language|Basque]] remained of the (relatively) [[Paleo-European languages|indigenous languages of Europe]] and the western half of Asia.\n\nDespite medieval invasions by [[Eurasian nomads]], a group to which the Proto-Indo-Europeans had once belonged, Indo-European expansion reached another peak in the [[early modern period]] with the dramatic increase in the population of the [[Indian subcontinent]] and European expansionism throughout the globe during the [[Age of Discovery]], as well as the continued replacement and assimilation of surrounding non-Indo-European languages and peoples due to increased state centralization and [[nationalism]]. These trends compounded throughout the modern period due to the general global [[population growth]] and the results of [[European colonization]] of the [[Western Hemisphere]] and [[Oceania]], leading to an explosion in the number of Indo-European speakers as well as the territories inhabited by them.\n\nDue to colonization and the modern dominance of Indo-European languages in the fields of politics, global science, technology, education, finance, and sports, even many modern countries whose populations largely speak non-Indo-European languages have Indo-European languages as official languages, and the majority of the global population speaks at least one Indo-European language. The overwhelming majority of [[languages used on the Internet]] are Indo-European, with [[English language|English]] continuing to lead the group; English in general has in many respects [[English as a lingua franca|become the ''lingua franca'']] of global communication.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==See also==\n{{col div|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Grammatical conjugation]]\n* ''[[The Horse, the Wheel, and Language]]'' (book)\n* [[Indo-European copula]]\n* [[Indo-European sound laws]]\n* [[Indo-European studies]]\n* [[Indo-Semitic languages]]\n* [[Indo-Uralic languages]]\n* [[Eurasiatic languages]]\n* [[Language family]]\n* [[Languages of Asia]]\n* [[Languages of Europe]]\n* [[Languages of India]]\n* [[List of Indo-European languages]]\n* [[Proto-Indo-European root]]\n* [[Proto-Indo-European religion]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book | last = Anthony | first = David W. | title = The Horse, the Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World | publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 2007 | isbn =978-0-691-05887-0 | ref = harv }}\n* {{cite book |last=Auroux |first=Sylvain |title=History of the Language Sciences |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |location=Berlin |year=2000 |isbn=978-3-11-016735-1 }}\n* {{cite book | last=Fortson | first=Benjamin W. | title=Indo-European Language and Culture: An Introduction |location=Malden, Massachusetts | publisher=Blackwell | year=2004 | isbn=978-1-4051-0315-2 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |title=Grundriss der Vergleichenden Grammatik der indogermanischen Sprachen |first=Karl |last=Brugmann |author-link=Karl Brugmann |language=de |volume=Erster Band |location=Strassburg |publisher=Karl J.

They are among what is probably the most ancient living group of chewing herbivorous insects, dating back to the [[early Triassic]] around 250 million years ago.\n\nGrasshoppers are typically ground-dwelling insects with powerful hind legs which allow them to escape from threats by leaping vigorously. As [[hemimetabolous]] insects, they do not undergo [[complete metamorphosis]]; they hatch from an egg into a [[Nymph (biology)|nymph]] or \"hopper\" which undergoes five [[moult]]s, becoming more similar to the adult insect at each developmental stage. At high population densities and under certain environmental conditions, some grasshopper species can change color and behavior and form swarms. Under these circumstances, they are known as [[locust]]s.\n\nGrasshoppers are plant-eaters, with a few species at times becoming serious [[pest (organism)|pest]]s of cereals, vegetables and pasture, especially when they swarm in their millions as locusts and destroy crops over wide areas. They protect themselves from [[predator]]s by [[camouflage]]; when detected, many species attempt to [[Deimatic behaviour|startle]] the predator with a brilliantly-coloured wing-flash while jumping and (if adult) launching themselves into the air, usually flying for only a short distance. Other species such as the [[rainbow grasshopper]] have [[warning coloration]] which deters predators. Grasshoppers are affected by parasites and various diseases, and many predatory creatures feed on both nymphs and adults. The eggs are subject to attack by [[parasitoid]]s and predators.\n\nGrasshoppers have had a long relationship with humans.

The three fused thoracic segments bear three pairs of legs and two pairs of wings. The forewings, known as [[tegmina]], are narrow and leathery while the hindwings are large and membranous, the veins providing strength. The legs are terminated by claws for gripping. The hind leg is particularly powerful; the femur is robust and has several ridges where different surfaces join and the inner ridges bear [[stridulatory]] pegs in some species. The posterior edge of the tibia bears a double row of spines and there are a pair of articulated spurs near its lower end. The interior of the thorax houses the muscles that control the wings and legs.<ref name=Pfadt1to8/>\n\n[[File:Heupferd fg01.jpg|thumb|[[Ensifera]], like this great green [[bush-cricket]] ''[[Tettigonia viridissima]]'', somewhat resemble grasshoppers but have over 20 segments in their [[antenna (biology)|antennae]] and different [[ovipositor]]s.]]\nThe abdomen has eleven segments, the first of which is fused to the thorax and contains the [[tympanal organ]] and hearing system.

The third stage of the jump is the trigger relaxation of the flexor muscle, which releases the tibia from the flexed position. The subsequent rapid tibial extension is driven mainly by the relaxation of the elastic structures, rather than by further shortening of the extensor muscle. In this way the stiff cuticle acts like the elastic of a [[catapult]], or the bow of a bow-and-arrow.

Late-stage male nymphs can sometimes be seen making stridulatory movements, although they lack the equipment to make sounds, demonstrating the importance of this behavioural trait. The songs are a means of communication; the male stridulation seems to express reproductive maturity, the desire for social cohesion and individual well-being. Social cohesion becomes necessary among grasshoppers because of their ability to jump or fly large distances, and the song can serve to limit dispersal and guide others to favourable habitat. The generalised song can vary in phraseology and intensity, and is modified in the presence of a rival male, and changes again to a courtship song when a female is nearby.<ref name=AES>{{cite journal |author=Brangham, A.N. |year=1960 |title=Communication among social insects |journal=Bulletin of the Amateur Entomologists' Society |volume=19 |pages=66\u201368 |url=https://archive.org/stream/bulletinofamateu1920amat#page/n113/mode/2up }}</ref> In male grasshoppers of the family Pneumoridae, the enlarged abdomen amplifies stridulation.<ref name=\"Donelson\"/>\n\n===Life cycle===\n[[File:Grasshoppermetasnodgrass.svg|thumb|upright=0.6|Six stages (instars) of development, from newly hatched nymph to fully winged adult]]\n[[File:Two eastern Lubber grasshopers (Romalea microptera), mating.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Romalea microptera]]'' grasshoppers: female (larger) is laying eggs, with male in attendance.]]\nIn most grasshopper species, conflicts between males over females rarely escalate beyond ritualistic displays.

Pasture, grain, forage, vegetable and other crops can be affected. Grasshoppers often bask in the sun, and thrive in warm sunny conditions, so drought stimulates an increase in grasshopper populations. A single season of drought is not normally sufficient to stimulate a major population increase, but several successive dry seasons can do so, especially if the intervening winters are mild so that large numbers of nymphs survive. Although sunny weather stimulates growth, there needs to be an adequate food supply for the increasing grasshopper population. This means that although precipitation is needed to stimulate plant growth, prolonged periods of cloudy weather will slow nymphal development.<ref name=Capinera1710>Capinera, 2008. pp. 1710\u20131712</ref>\n\nGrasshoppers can best be prevented from becoming pests by manipulating their environment. Shade provided by trees will discourage them and they may be prevented from moving onto developing crops by removing coarse vegetation from fallow land and field margins and discouraging thick growth beside ditches and on roadside verges. With increasing numbers of grasshoppers, predator numbers may increase, but this seldom happens rapidly enough to have much effect on populations. Biological control is being investigated, and spores of the protozoan parasite ''[[Nosema locustae]]'' can be used mixed with bait to control grasshoppers, being more effective with immature insects.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www3.epa.gov/pesticides/chem_search/reg_actions/registration/fs_PC-117001_01-Oct-00.pdf |title=''Nosema Locustae'' (117001) Fact Sheet |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency |date=October 2000 |accessdate=6 August 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817073223/https://www3.epa.gov/pesticides/chem_search/reg_actions/registration/fs_PC-117001_01-Oct-00.pdf |archivedate=17 August 2016 }}</ref>  On a small scale, [[Azadirachta indica|neem products]] can be effective as a feeding deterrent and as a disruptor of nymphal development.

They are among what is probably the most ancient living group of chewing herbivorous insects, dating back to the [[early Triassic]] around 250 million years ago.\n\nGrasshoppers are typically ground-dwelling insects with powerful hind legs which allow them to escape from threats by leaping vigorously. As [[hemimetabolous]] insects, they do not undergo [[complete metamorphosis]]; they hatch from an egg into a [[Nymph (biology)|nymph]] or \"hopper\" which undergoes five [[moult]]s, becoming more similar to the adult insect at each developmental stage. At high population densities and under certain environmental conditions, some grasshopper species can change color and behavior and form swarms. Under these circumstances, they are known as [[locust]]s.\n\nGrasshoppers are plant-eaters, with a few species at times becoming serious [[pest (organism)|pest]]s of cereals, vegetables and pasture, especially when they swarm in their millions as locusts and destroy crops over wide areas. They protect themselves from [[predator]]s by [[camouflage]]; when detected, many species attempt to [[Deimatic behaviour|startle]] the predator with a brilliantly-coloured wing-flash while jumping and (if adult) launching themselves into the air, usually flying for only a short distance. Other species such as the [[rainbow grasshopper]] have [[warning coloration]] which deters predators. Grasshoppers are affected by parasites and various diseases, and many predatory creatures feed on both nymphs and adults. The eggs are subject to attack by [[parasitoid]]s and predators.\n\nGrasshoppers have had a long relationship with humans. Swarms of locusts can have devastating effects and cause famine, and even in smaller numbers, the insects can be serious pests. They are used as food in countries such as Mexico and Indonesia. They feature in art, symbolism and literature.\n\n==Phylogeny==\nGrasshoppers belong to the suborder Caelifera.

The head is held vertically at an angle to the body, with the mouth at the bottom. The head bears a large pair of [[compound eye]]s which give all-round vision, three simple eyes which can detect light and dark, and a pair of thread-like [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] that are sensitive to touch and smell. The downward-directed mouthparts are modified for chewing and there are two sensory palps in front of the [[Mandible (insect mouthpart)|jaws]].<ref name=Pfadt1to8>Pfadt, 1994. pp. 1\u20138</ref>\n\nThe thorax and abdomen are segmented and have a rigid [[cuticle]] made up of overlapping plates composed of [[chitin]]. The three fused thoracic segments bear three pairs of legs and two pairs of wings. The forewings, known as [[tegmina]], are narrow and leathery while the hindwings are large and membranous, the veins providing strength. The legs are terminated by claws for gripping. The hind leg is particularly powerful; the femur is robust and has several ridges where different surfaces join and the inner ridges bear [[stridulatory]] pegs in some species. The posterior edge of the tibia bears a double row of spines and there are a pair of articulated spurs near its lower end. The interior of the thorax houses the muscles that control the wings and legs.<ref name=Pfadt1to8/>\n\n[[File:Heupferd fg01.jpg|thumb|[[Ensifera]], like this great green [[bush-cricket]] ''[[Tettigonia viridissima]]'', somewhat resemble grasshoppers but have over 20 segments in their [[antenna (biology)|antennae]] and different [[ovipositor]]s.]]\nThe abdomen has eleven segments, the first of which is fused to the thorax and contains the [[tympanal organ]] and hearing system. Segments two to eight are ring-shaped and joined by flexible membranes. Segments nine to eleven are reduced in size; segment nine bears a pair of [[cercus|cerci]] and segments ten and eleven house the reproductive organs.

A heart-like structure in the upper part of the abdomen pumps the fluid to the head from where it percolates past the tissues and organs on its way back to the abdomen. This system circulates nutrients throughout the body and carries [[metabolic waste]]s to be excreted into the gut. Other functions of the haemolymph include wound healing, heat transfer and the provision of hydrostatic pressure, but the circulatory system is not involved in gaseous exchange.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://projects.ncsu.edu/cals/course/ent425/library/tutorials/internal_anatomy/circulatory.html |title=Circulatory system |author=Meyer, John R. |date=8 April 2009 |work=General Entomology |publisher=NC State University |accessdate=12 April 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103003933/https://projects.ncsu.edu/cals/course/ent425/library/tutorials/internal_anatomy/circulatory.html |archivedate=3 January 2017 }}</ref> Respiration is performed using [[Trachea#Invertebrates|trachea]]e, air-filled tubes, which open at the surfaces of the thorax and abdomen through pairs of valved [[Spiracle (arthropods)|spiracle]]s.

The third stage of the jump is the trigger relaxation of the flexor muscle, which releases the tibia from the flexed position. The subsequent rapid tibial extension is driven mainly by the relaxation of the elastic structures, rather than by further shortening of the extensor muscle. In this way the stiff cuticle acts like the elastic of a [[catapult]], or the bow of a bow-and-arrow. Energy is put into the store at low power by slow but strong muscle contraction, and retrieved from the store at high power by rapid relaxation of the mechanical elastic structures.<ref>{{cite book |author=Biewener, Andrew A. |title=Animal Locomotion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yMaN9pk8QJAC&pg=PA172 |year=2003 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-850022-3 |pages=172\u2013175 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171127023307/https://books.google.com/books?id=yMaN9pk8QJAC&pg=PA172 |archivedate=27 November 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Vogel |title=Comparative Biomechanics: Life's Physical World |date=2013 |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=312 |edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\n===Stridulation===\n{{Listen|filename=Grasshoppers.ogg|title=Grasshopper stridulation|description=Several unidentified grasshoppers stridulating}}\nMale grasshoppers spend much of the day stridulating, singing more actively under optimal conditions and being more subdued when conditions are adverse; females also stridulate, but their efforts are insignificant when compared to the males. Late-stage male nymphs can sometimes be seen making stridulatory movements, although they lack the equipment to make sounds, demonstrating the importance of this behavioural trait. The songs are a means of communication; the male stridulation seems to express reproductive maturity, the desire for social cohesion and individual well-being. Social cohesion becomes necessary among grasshoppers because of their ability to jump or fly large distances, and the song can serve to limit dispersal and guide others to favourable habitat. The generalised song can vary in phraseology and intensity, and is modified in the presence of a rival male, and changes again to a courtship song when a female is nearby.<ref name=AES>{{cite journal |author=Brangham, A.N. |year=1960 |title=Communication among social insects |journal=Bulletin of the Amateur Entomologists' Society |volume=19 |pages=66\u201368 |url=https://archive.org/stream/bulletinofamateu1920amat#page/n113/mode/2up }}</ref> In male grasshoppers of the family Pneumoridae, the enlarged abdomen amplifies stridulation.<ref name=\"Donelson\"/>\n\n===Life cycle===\n[[File:Grasshoppermetasnodgrass.svg|thumb|upright=0.6|Six stages (instars) of development, from newly hatched nymph to fully winged adult]]\n[[File:Two eastern Lubber grasshopers (Romalea microptera), mating.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Romalea microptera]]'' grasshoppers: female (larger) is laying eggs, with male in attendance.]]\nIn most grasshopper species, conflicts between males over females rarely escalate beyond ritualistic displays.

Pasture, grain, forage, vegetable and other crops can be affected. Grasshoppers often bask in the sun, and thrive in warm sunny conditions, so drought stimulates an increase in grasshopper populations. A single season of drought is not normally sufficient to stimulate a major population increase, but several successive dry seasons can do so, especially if the intervening winters are mild so that large numbers of nymphs survive. Although sunny weather stimulates growth, there needs to be an adequate food supply for the increasing grasshopper population. This means that although precipitation is needed to stimulate plant growth, prolonged periods of cloudy weather will slow nymphal development.<ref name=Capinera1710>Capinera, 2008. pp. 1710\u20131712</ref>\n\nGrasshoppers can best be prevented from becoming pests by manipulating their environment. Shade provided by trees will discourage them and they may be prevented from moving onto developing crops by removing coarse vegetation from fallow land and field margins and discouraging thick growth beside ditches and on roadside verges. With increasing numbers of grasshoppers, predator numbers may increase, but this seldom happens rapidly enough to have much effect on populations. Biological control is being investigated, and spores of the protozoan parasite ''[[Nosema locustae]]'' can be used mixed with bait to control grasshoppers, being more effective with immature insects.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www3.epa.gov/pesticides/chem_search/reg_actions/registration/fs_PC-117001_01-Oct-00.pdf |title=''Nosema Locustae'' (117001) Fact Sheet |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency |date=October 2000 |accessdate=6 August 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817073223/https://www3.epa.gov/pesticides/chem_search/reg_actions/registration/fs_PC-117001_01-Oct-00.pdf |archivedate=17 August 2016 }}</ref>  On a small scale, [[Azadirachta indica|neem products]] can be effective as a feeding deterrent and as a disruptor of nymphal development.
