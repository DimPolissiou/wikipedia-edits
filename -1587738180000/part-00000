Built between 1939 and 1947 as '''MS ''Willem Ruys''''', a [[passenger liner]] for the Rotterdamsche Lloyd, she was [[Achille Lauro hijacking|hijacked]] by members of the [[Palestine Liberation Front]] in 1985.\n\nIn other incidents, she also suffered two serious collisions (in 1953 with the {{MS|Oranje}} and in 1975 with the cargo ship ''Youseff'') and four onboard fires or explosions (in 1965, 1972, 1981, and 1994). In the last of these, in 1994, the ship caught fire and sank in the [[Indian Ocean]] off [[Somalia]].\n\n==Concept and construction==\nOrdered in 1938 to replace the aging ships on the [[Dutch East Indies]] route, her [[keel]] was laid in 1939 at De Schelde shipyard in [[Vlissingen]], [[Netherlands]], for Rotterdamsche Lloyd (now [[Nedlloyd]]). Interrupted by [[World War II]] and two bombing raids, the ship was finally launched in July 1946, as ''Willem Ruys''. The ship was named after the grandson of the founder of the Rotterdamsche Lloyd who was taken hostage and shot during the war.\n\n''Willem Ruys'' was completed in late 1947. At that time, the Rotterdamsche Lloyd had been granted a royal prefix in honour of its services during the war. ''Willem Ruys'' was {{convert|192|m|ft|0}} in length, {{convert|25|m|ft|0}} in beam, had a draught of {{convert|8.9|m|ft|1}}, and measured 21,119 [[tonnage|gross register ton]]s. Eight [[Sulzer (manufacturer)|Sulzer]] engines drove two [[propeller]]s. She could accommodate 900 passengers. She featured a superstructure very different from other liners of that era; ''Willem Ruys'' pioneered low-slung aluminium lifeboats, within the upper-works' flanks. The next ship to adopt this unique arrangement was the {{SS|Canberra}} in 1961. Today, all cruise ships follow this layout, with fibreglass-reinforced plastic (FRP) used for lifeboat hulls.\n\n==Service history==\n\n===As the ''Willem Ruys''===\n\n====On the East Indies route====\nAs ''Willem Ruys'', the ship began her maiden voyage on 5 December 1947. Together with her main competitor and running mate, the [[MS Oranje|MS ''Oranje'']] of the [[Netherland Line]], she became a popular fixture on the [[Dutch East Indies]] route. However, when the East Indies gained independence from The Netherlands in 1949, passengers' numbers decreased.\n\nThe former [[Prime Minister of Singapore]], [[Lee Kuan Yew]], had travelled aboard ''Willem Ruys'' as a fresh graduate upon completing his studies in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"Time\">{{cite magazine|url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2056737-5,00.html|title=The Singapore Story|magazine=Time|date= 3 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Collision with ''Oranje''====\nOn 6 January 1953, ''Willem Ruys'' collided in the Red Sea with running mate {{MS|Oranje}}, which was heading in the opposite direction. At that time, it was common for passenger ships to pass each other at close range to entertain their passengers. During the (later heavily criticized) abrupt and fast approach of ''Oranje'', ''Willem Ruys'' made an unexpected swing to the left, resulting in a collision. ''Oranje'' badly damaged her bow. Due to the possibility that she would be impounded for safety reasons, she was unable to call at Colombo as scheduled, and went directly to Jakarta. ''Willem Ruys'' suffered less damage. There was no loss of life involved. Later, it was determined that miscommunication on both ships had caused the collision.\n\n====Journey to Java====\nDuring 1957, the English diplomat, author and diarist [[Harold Nicolson]] and his wife, the author and poet [[Vita Sackville-West]], toured the [[Far East]] for two months aboard ''Willem Ruys''. The voyage is documented in ''Journey to Java'', his published journal of the trip,<ref name=\"Journey To Java\">{{cite book |title= Journey to Java |last= Nicolson|first= Harold|year= 1957|publisher= Constable|location= [[London]]}}</ref> which provides a detailed account of [[first class travel]] on the vessel in the 1950s.\n\n====Later years====\nAfter repairs, Royal Rotterdam Lloyd decided to release ''Willem Ruys'' on the North Atlantic run. First, she was placed on the [[New York (state)|New York]] service, and later [[Canada]] was included.\n\nIn 1958, the Royal Rotterdamsche Lloyd and the [[Netherland Line]] signed a co-operative agreement to create a round-the-world passenger service. The joint fleet would sail under the banner of \"The Royal Dutch Mail Ships\". Together with ''Oranje'' and ''[[TSMS Lakonia|Johan van Oldenbarneveldt]]'', ''Willem Ruys'' underwent an extensive refit to prepare her for this new service. She made two charter trips to [[Montreal]] for the Europa-Canada service. Then, from 20 September 1958, until 25 February 1959, she underwent a major facelift at the [[Wilton-Fijenoord]] shipyard in [[Amsterdam]], turning her from a passenger liner into a cruise ship. Her original four class distinctions became First and Tourist Class. A hundred new cabins were installed and [[air-conditioning]] was extended throughout all accommodations. The Javanese crew members were replaced by Europeans, who required upgraded crew accommodation. Externally, she was fitted with a new glazing in Tourist Class Wintergarden, her forward funnel was heightened and [[Stabilizer (ship)|stabilizers]] were fitted. ''Willem Ruys'' was now able to accommodate 275 first class and 770 tourist class passengers, although there were many interchangeable cabins which had additional berths fitted, which could increase the maximum passenger number to 1167. Her new specifications would see her tonnage increase from 21,119 to 23,114 [[tonnage|gross register ton]].\n\nOn 7 March 1959, ''Willem Ruys'' went off on her new world service to [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. She departed from [[Rotterdam]], sailing via [[Southampton]], the [[Mediterranean]], the [[Suez Canal]], [[Fremantle]], [[Melbourne]], [[Sydney]], [[New Zealand]], returning via the [[Panama Canal]]. The Royal Dutch Mail Ships (''Willem Ruys'', ''Johan van Oldenbarnevelt'' and ''Oranje'') became a popular alternative to the British liners.\n\nAt the end of 1964, due to a strong drop in passenger numbers, ''Willem Ruys'' was laid up in [[Rotterdam]] and put up for sale.\n\n===As ''Achille Lauro''===\nIn 1965, she was sold to the [[Flotta Lauro Line]], or [[Star Lauro]], (now [[MSC Cruises]]) and renamed ''Achille Lauro'' after [[Achille Lauro|the company's owner]]. She was extensively rebuilt and modernized after an August 1965 onboard explosion, and entered service in 1966 carrying passengers to [[Sydney]], Australia. The ship played a role in evacuating the families of British servicemen caught up in unrest in [[Aden]], and made one of the last northbound transits through the [[Suez Canal]] before its closure during the [[Six-Day War]].\n\n''Achille Lauro'' was converted to a cruise ship in early 1972, during which time she suffered a disastrous fire. A 1975 collision with the cargo ship ''Youseff'' resulted in the sinking of the latter, and another onboard fire in 1981 took her out of service for a time. She was laid up in [[Tenerife]] when Lauro Lines went bankrupt in 1982. The [[Chandris Line]] took possession of her under a charter arrangement in 1985, shortly before the hijacking.\n\n====1985 hijacking====\n{{main|Achille Lauro hijacking}}\nOn 7 October 1985, four members of the [[Palestine Liberation Front]] (PLF) took control of the liner off [[Egypt]] as she was sailing from [[Alexandria]] to [[Port Said]]. Holding the passengers and crew hostage, they directed the vessel to sail to [[Tartus]], [[Syria]], and demanded the release of 50 [[Palestinians]] then in Israeli prisons. After being refused permission to dock at Tartus, the hijackers killed disabled Jewish-American passenger [[Leon Klinghoffer]] and then threw his body overboard.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web |last=Berman |first=Daphna |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=981987&contrassID=2&subContrassID=16 |title=Klinghoffer daughters recall personal tragedy at commemoration of terror victims outside Israel |work=Haaretz |date=9 May 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe ship then headed back towards Port Said, and after two days of negotiations, the hijackers agreed to abandon the liner in exchange for safe conduct and were flown towards [[Tunisia]] aboard an Egyptian commercial airliner. This plane, however, was intercepted by US fighter aircraft and directed to land in [[Sicily]], where the hijackers were to be tried for murder, but could not be extradited. The four terrorists were sentenced to prison terms by the Italian courts, while the operation's mastermind, who had not taken part in the actual hijacking, was given passage to Yugoslavia and escaped.\n\n====Later years, fire, and sinking====\nThe ship continued in service; she was reflagged in 1987 when the Lauro Line was taken over by the [[Mediterranean Shipping Company]] to become \"StarLauro\". On 30 November 1994, she caught fire off the coast of Somalia while ''en route'' to [[South Africa]], with 979 passengers and crew on board. At that time, Italian officials said the fire had been caused by a discarded cigarette, but it actually began in the engine room after one of the engines exploded. Because of a lack of supervision, the fire burned out of control before its discovery.<ref name=\"NYTimes\">{{cite news |last=Cowell |first=Alan |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/02/world/achille-lauro-smolders-after-1000-are-rescued.html|title=Achille Lauro Smolders After 1,000 Are Rescued|work=[[The New York Times]]|date= 2 December 1994 |access-date=30 September 2019 }}</ref> The crew tried to battle the fire for several hours but were unsuccessful.

After being refused permission to dock at Tartus, the hijackers killed disabled Jewish-American passenger [[Leon Klinghoffer]] and then threw his body overboard.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web |last=Berman |first=Daphna |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=981987&contrassID=2&subContrassID=16 |title=Klinghoffer daughters recall personal tragedy at commemoration of terror victims outside Israel |work=Haaretz |date=9 May 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe ship then headed back towards Port Said, and after two days of negotiations, the hijackers agreed to abandon the liner in exchange for safe conduct and were flown towards [[Tunisia]] aboard an Egyptian commercial airliner. This plane, however, was intercepted by US fighter aircraft and directed to land in [[Sicily]], where the hijackers were to be tried for murder, but could not be extradited. The four terrorists were sentenced to prison terms by the Italian courts, while the operation's mastermind, who had not taken part in the actual hijacking, was given passage to Yugoslavia and escaped.\n\n====Later years, fire, and sinking====\nThe ship continued in service; she was reflagged in 1987 when the Lauro Line was taken over by the [[Mediterranean Shipping Company]] to become \"StarLauro\". On 30 November 1994, she caught fire off the coast of Somalia while ''en route'' to [[South Africa]], with 979 passengers and crew on board. At that time, Italian officials said the fire had been caused by a discarded cigarette, but it actually began in the engine room after one of the engines exploded. Because of a lack of supervision, the fire burned out of control before its discovery.<ref name=\"NYTimes\">{{cite news |last=Cowell |first=Alan |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/02/world/achille-lauro-smolders-after-1000-are-rescued.html|title=Achille Lauro Smolders After 1,000 Are Rescued|work=[[The New York Times]]|date= 2 December 1994 |access-date=30 September 2019 }}</ref> The crew tried to battle the fire for several hours but were unsuccessful.

His father, Mario, also a footballer, inspired him to play from a young age. At the age of seven he began playing with a junior team and at fourteen, he joined the Talleres reserves. A prolific goalscorer, at club level he is best known for playing for [[Valencia CF|Valencia]], finishing as [[La Liga]]'s [[Pichichi Trophy|top goalscorer]] twice, and amassing 116 goals in 184 league games for the club.\n\nAt international level, Kempes was the focal point of Argentina's [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978 World Cup]] win where he scored twice in the [[1978 FIFA World Cup Final|final]], and received the [[FIFA World Cup awards#Golden Boot|Golden Boot]] as top goalscorer. He also won the [[FIFA World Cup awards#Golden Ball|Golden Ball]] for the player of the tournament, making him one of only three players to have won all three awards at a single World Cup, along with [[Garrincha]] in 1962, and [[Paolo Rossi]] in 1982.\n\nKempes won [[South American Footballer of the Year]], [[Onze d'Or|Onze d'Or European footballer of the Year]], and [[FIFA World Cup awards#Golden Ball|World Cup Golden Ball]] in 1978. In 2004, he was named as one of the [[FIFA 100|Top 125 greatest living footballers]] as part of [[FIFA]]'s 100th anniversary celebration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/3533891.stm |title=Pele's list of the greatest |publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 March 2004 |accessdate=15 June 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Club career==\n[[File:Mario Kempes River Plate.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Mario Kempes during his period in [[Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate|River Plate]], 1981]]\nKempes was nicknamed ''El Toro'' and ''El Matador''. He was born in [[Bell Ville]], [[C\u00f3rdoba Province, Argentina|C\u00f3rdoba]]. His career started at local club [[Instituto Atl\u00e9tico Central C\u00f3rdoba|Instituto]], where he played alongside [[Osvaldo Ardiles]] before quickly moving on to [[Rosario Central]], where he scored 85 goals in 105 matches and established himself as a remarkable goalscorer, which prompted a move to [[Valencia CF]]. At [[Mestalla]] he would go on to win the [[Copa del Rey]], the [[European Cup Winners' Cup]] and the [[UEFA Super Cup]] as well as two consecutive [[Pichichi Trophy|Pichichi]]s, scoring 24 and 28 goals in 1976\u201377 and 1977\u201378 seasons. Famous as a hard-working forward, he used to strike from outside the [[penalty area]] with his surging runs towards goal and was not the traditional center-forward operating solely inside the box. Many [[Defender (association football)|defenders]] found difficulty handling his attacking style.\n\nBefore the [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978 World Cup]], Kempes was the only foreign based player on the list of coach [[C\u00e9sar Luis Menotti]]'s national team in [[Argentina]], he was at the time playing for Spanish giants [[Valencia CF|Valencia]] while the other squad members all played in Argentina. The coach described him when announcing the squad he had selected for the 1978 tournament, \"He's strong, he's got skill, he creates spaces and he shoots hard. He's a player who can make a difference, and he can play in a centre-forward position.\"\n\nKempes had been the top scorer in [[La Liga]] the previous two seasons and was determined to show on home soil that he could deliver against the best on the sport's greatest stage. However, in 1974, at the age of 20, he failed to get on the score-sheet in [[West Germany]] and after the first round group stage in 1978, his name was still missing among goal scorers in the [[tournament]].\n\n==International career==\n[[File:Mario Kempes Argentina vs. Holanda.JPG|thumb|right|180px|Kempes celebrating one of his 2 goals at the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]] final match v. Netherlands in Buenos Aires]]\nDuring his club career he won 43 caps for [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] and scored 20 times. He represented his country in three [[FIFA World Cup|World Cups]] in [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974]], [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978]] and [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]], winning the competition in 1978. He was the [[FIFA World Cup awards#Golden Boot|leading goalscorer]] in the 1978 tournament, scoring six goals in three braces: The first two in Argentina's first semifinal group stage match against Poland, another two against Peru, and the last two of these goals in the final against the Netherlands, which Argentina won 3\u20131. His second goal, in the 105th minute, was the game winner in extra time. However, in the same tournament, he notoriously stopped a goal with his hand in a second round match against Poland.<ref>Argentina vs Poland \u2013 World Cup 1978 \u2013 full match \u2013 part 4/8 @YouTube</ref> This resulted in a penalty kick that was promptly saved by [[Ubaldo Fillol]].<ref>[https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=50/results/matches/match=2202/report.html FIFA.com 1978 World Cup Match Report \u2013 Argentina \u2013 Poland]</ref> His goals in the 1978 World Cup Final were his last for Argentina at the age of just 23.\n\nIn 1978, he was named ''South American Football Player of the Year'' (\"El Mundo,\" Caracas, Venezuela). He was named by [[Pel\u00e9]] as one of the [[FIFA 100|top 125 greatest living footballers]] in March 2004.\n\n==Managerial career==\nKempes made his full-time managing debut in Albania. His brief spell with [[KS Lushnja|Lushnja]] was groundbreaking, as he became the first foreign manager who signed a foreign player for the first time in Albanian football history. His career in Albania came to a quick end in 1997. The following year, he landed a job with Venezuelan side [[Mineros de Guayana]]. In 1999, Kempes moved to Bolivia and managed [[The Strongest]], before taking charge of [[Club Blooming|Blooming]] in 2000. Previously, he worked as assistant coach for Uruguayan manager [[H\u00e9ctor N\u00fa\u00f1ez]] in [[Valencia CF|Valencia]], and as a player-manager of [[Liga Indonesia|Indonesian League]] champions [[Pelita Bandung Raya|Pelita Jaya]].\n\n==Commentary career==\nHe currently works as a football analyst and commentator in Spanish for [[ESPN Deportes]] ([[ESPN]]'s Spanish-language version).

In 2004, he was named as one of the [[FIFA 100|Top 125 greatest living footballers]] as part of [[FIFA]]'s 100th anniversary celebration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/3533891.stm |title=Pele's list of the greatest |publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 March 2004 |accessdate=15 June 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Club career==\n[[File:Mario Kempes River Plate.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Mario Kempes during his period in [[Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate|River Plate]], 1981]]\nKempes was nicknamed ''El Toro'' and ''El Matador''. He was born in [[Bell Ville]], [[C\u00f3rdoba Province, Argentina|C\u00f3rdoba]]. His career started at local club [[Instituto Atl\u00e9tico Central C\u00f3rdoba|Instituto]], where he played alongside [[Osvaldo Ardiles]] before quickly moving on to [[Rosario Central]], where he scored 85 goals in 105 matches and established himself as a remarkable goalscorer, which prompted a move to [[Valencia CF]]. At [[Mestalla]] he would go on to win the [[Copa del Rey]], the [[European Cup Winners' Cup]] and the [[UEFA Super Cup]] as well as two consecutive [[Pichichi Trophy|Pichichi]]s, scoring 24 and 28 goals in 1976\u201377 and 1977\u201378 seasons. Famous as a hard-working forward, he used to strike from outside the [[penalty area]] with his surging runs towards goal and was not the traditional center-forward operating solely inside the box. Many [[Defender (association football)|defenders]] found difficulty handling his attacking style.\n\nBefore the [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978 World Cup]], Kempes was the only foreign based player on the list of coach [[C\u00e9sar Luis Menotti]]'s national team in [[Argentina]], he was at the time playing for Spanish giants [[Valencia CF|Valencia]] while the other squad members all played in Argentina. The coach described him when announcing the squad he had selected for the 1978 tournament, \"He's strong, he's got skill, he creates spaces and he shoots hard. He's a player who can make a difference, and he can play in a centre-forward position.\"\n\nKempes had been the top scorer in [[La Liga]] the previous two seasons and was determined to show on home soil that he could deliver against the best on the sport's greatest stage. However, in 1974, at the age of 20, he failed to get on the score-sheet in [[West Germany]] and after the first round group stage in 1978, his name was still missing among goal scorers in the [[tournament]].\n\n==International career==\n[[File:Mario Kempes Argentina vs. Holanda.JPG|thumb|right|180px|Kempes celebrating one of his 2 goals at the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]] final match v. Netherlands in Buenos Aires]]\nDuring his club career he won 43 caps for [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] and scored 20 times. He represented his country in three [[FIFA World Cup|World Cups]] in [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974]], [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978]] and [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]], winning the competition in 1978. He was the [[FIFA World Cup awards#Golden Boot|leading goalscorer]] in the 1978 tournament, scoring six goals in three braces: The first two in Argentina's first semifinal group stage match against Poland, another two against Peru, and the last two of these goals in the final against the Netherlands, which Argentina won 3\u20131. His second goal, in the 105th minute, was the game winner in extra time. However, in the same tournament, he notoriously stopped a goal with his hand in a second round match against Poland.<ref>Argentina vs Poland \u2013 World Cup 1978 \u2013 full match \u2013 part 4/8 @YouTube</ref> This resulted in a penalty kick that was promptly saved by [[Ubaldo Fillol]].<ref>[https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=50/results/matches/match=2202/report.html FIFA.com 1978 World Cup Match Report \u2013 Argentina \u2013 Poland]</ref> His goals in the 1978 World Cup Final were his last for Argentina at the age of just 23.\n\nIn 1978, he was named ''South American Football Player of the Year'' (\"El Mundo,\" Caracas, Venezuela). He was named by [[Pel\u00e9]] as one of the [[FIFA 100|top 125 greatest living footballers]] in March 2004.\n\n==Managerial career==\nKempes made his full-time managing debut in Albania. His brief spell with [[KS Lushnja|Lushnja]] was groundbreaking, as he became the first foreign manager who signed a foreign player for the first time in Albanian football history. His career in Albania came to a quick end in 1997. The following year, he landed a job with Venezuelan side [[Mineros de Guayana]]. In 1999, Kempes moved to Bolivia and managed [[The Strongest]], before taking charge of [[Club Blooming|Blooming]] in 2000. Previously, he worked as assistant coach for Uruguayan manager [[H\u00e9ctor N\u00fa\u00f1ez]] in [[Valencia CF|Valencia]], and as a player-manager of [[Liga Indonesia|Indonesian League]] champions [[Pelita Bandung Raya|Pelita Jaya]].\n\n==Commentary career==\nHe currently works as a football analyst and commentator in Spanish for [[ESPN Deportes]] ([[ESPN]]'s Spanish-language version). Moreover, he as well as Fernando Palomo and Ciro Procuna provide the commentary in the Latin American version of the videogames [[FIFA 13]], [[FIFA 14]], [[FIFA 15]], [[FIFA 16]], [[FIFA 17]], [[FIFA 18]], [[FIFA 19]] and [[FIFA 20]].\n\n==Career statistics==\n===Club===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Club\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n!colspan=\"3\"|League\n!colspan=\"2\"|Cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|Continental\n!colspan=\"2\"|Other\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n|-\n!Division||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals\n|-\n|[[Instituto Atl\u00e9tico Central C\u00f3rdoba|Instituto]]||[[Primera Divisi\u00f3n Argentina 1973|1973]]||[[Primera Divisi\u00f3n Argentina|Primera Divisi\u00f3n]]||13||11||||||||||||||13||11\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|[[Rosario Central|Central]]||[[Primera Divisi\u00f3n Argentina 1974|1974]]||rowspan=\"3\"|Primera Divisi\u00f3n||36||29||||||||||||||36||29\n|-\n|[[Primera Divisi\u00f3n Argentina 1975|1975]]||49||35||||||||||||||49||35\n|-\n|[[Primera Divisi\u00f3n Argentina 1976|1976]]||22||21||||||||||||||22||21\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!107||85||||||||||||||107||85\n|-\n|rowspan=\"6\"|[[Valencia CF|Valencia]]||[[1976\u201377 La Liga|1976\u201377]]||rowspan=\"5\"|[[La Liga]]||34||24||0||0||-||-||-||-||34||24\n|-\n|[[1977\u201378 La Liga|1977\u201378]]||34||28||12||11||-||-||-||-||46||39\n|-\n|[[1978\u201379 La Liga|1978\u201379]]||30||12||10||3||6||3||-||-||46||18\n|-\n|[[1979\u201380 La Liga|1979\u201380]]||32||22||2||2||9||9||-||-||43||33\n|-\n|[[1980\u201381 La Liga|1980\u201381]]||12||9||1||0||5||2||-||-||18||11\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!142||95||25||16||20||14||||||167||101\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|[[Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate|River Plate]]||[[Primera Divisi\u00f3n Argentina 1981|1981]]||rowspan=\"2\"|Primera Divisi\u00f3n||29||15||||||||||||||29||15\n|-\n|[[Primera Divisi\u00f3n Argentina 1982|1982]]||0||0||||||||||||||0||0\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!29||15||||||||||||||29||15\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|[[Valencia CF|Valencia]]||[[1982\u201383 La Liga|1982\u201383]]||rowspan=\"2\"|La Liga||27||13||1||0||8||0||2||0||38||13\n|-\n|[[1983\u201384 La Liga|1983\u201384]]||15||8||4||3||0||0||2||0||21||11\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!42||21||5||3||8||0||4||0||47||24\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|[[H\u00e9rcules CF|H\u00e9rcules]]||[[1984\u201385 La Liga|1984\u201385]]||rowspan=\"2\"|La Liga||17||1||2||0||||||||||19||1\n|-\n|[[1985\u201386 La Liga|1985\u201386]]||21||9||2||1||||||||||23||10\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!38||10||4||1||||||||||42||11\n|-\n|[[First Vienna FC|First Vienna]]||[[Austrian Football Bundesliga 1986\u201387|1986\u201387]]||[[Austrian Football Bundesliga|Austrian Bundesliga]]||20||7||||||||||||||20||7\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|[[VSE St. P\u00f6lten|Sankt P\u00f6lten]]||[[Austrian Football Bundesliga 1987\u201388|1987\u201388]]||[[Austrian Football First League|First League]]||32||10||||||||||||||32||10\n|-\n|[[Austrian Football Bundesliga 1988\u201389|1988\u201389]]||rowspan=\"2\"|Austrian Bundesliga||29||9||||||||||||||29||9\n|-\n|[[1989\u201390 Austrian Football Bundesliga|1989\u201390]]||35||15||||||||||||||35||15\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!96||34||||||||||||||96||34\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|[[Kremser SC]]||[[1990\u201391 Austrian Football Bundesliga|1990\u201391]]||rowspan=\"2\"|Austrian Bundesliga||21||5||||||||||||||21||5\n|-\n|[[1991\u201392 Austrian Football Bundesliga|1991\u201392]]||18||2||||||||||||||18||2\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!39||7||||||||||||||39||7\n|-\n|[[Club Deportivo Arturo Fern\u00e1ndez Vial|Fern\u00e1ndez Vial]]||1992\u201393||[[Chilean Primera Divisi\u00f3n B|Primera B]]||11||5||||||||||||||11||5\n|-\n|[[Pelita Bandung Raya|Pelita Jaya]]||[[Liga Indonesia 1993\u201394|1993\u201394]]||[[Indonesian football league system|Liga Indonesia]]||15||10||||||||||||||15||10\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\"|Career total\n!552||300||34||20||||||||||586||320\n|}\n\n===International===\n:Source:<ref>{{NFT|12656|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|colspan=\"3\"|[[Argentina national football team|Argentina national team]]\n|-\n!Year!!Apps!!Goals\n|-\n|1973||1||0\n|-\n|1974||10||4\n|-\n|1975||4||3\n|-\n|1976||9||7\n|-\n|1977||0||0\n|-\n|1978||7||6\n|-\n|1979||0||0\n|-\n|1980||0||0\n|-\n|1981||3||0\n|-\n|1982||9||0\n|-\n!Total||43||20\n|}\n\n===International goals===\n\n:''Scores and results list Argentina's goal tally first.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! # !!

Because imipenem is rapidly inactivated by renal dehydropeptidase I, it is given in combination with cilastatin, a DHP-I inhibitor which increases half-life and tissue penetration of imipenem. Imipenem/cilastatin, like other carbapenems, binds to bacterial penicillin-binding proteins and interferes with bacterial cell wall integrity and synthesis. It has activity against many aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, including ''Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. viridans''- group streptococci, ''Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Bacteroides fragilis'' and ''Peptostreptococcus'' species. Imipenem/cilastatin was approved for use in the United States in 1985.  Imipenem/cilastatin is indicated for the treatment of severe or complicated skin, tissue, joint, respiratory tract, intra-abdominal, urinary tract and urogenital infections, but not meningitis (as it does not pass through the blood brain barrier), endocarditis, and sepsis due to susceptible organisms. Its use is generally restricted to severe infections largely in hospitalized patients. The recommended dosage is 250&nbsp;mg to 1 gram given intravenously every 6 to 8 hours or in intramuscular doses of no more than 1.5 gm daily, usually for five to 14 days. It is commercially available as Primaxin as 250-mg or 500-mg infusion bottles for IV use or 500-mg or 750-mg vials of lyophilized powder for IM injection. The most common side effects of imipenem are diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, skin rash, [[pruritus]], and injection-site reactions.\n\n==Pharmacology==\n\n=== Mechanism of action ===\nImipenem inhibits bacterial cell-wall synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins; cilastatin prevents renal metabolism of imipenem.\n\n=== Bioavailability ===\nIntramuscular injection:\n* imipenem: 60\u201375%\n* cilastatin: 95\u2013100%\n\n=== Distribution ===\nThe drug is distributed rapidly and widely to most tissues and fluids, including sputum, pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, interstitial fluid, bile, aqueous humor, reproductive organs, and bone; highest concentrations occur in pleural fluid, interstitial fluid, peritoneal fluid, and reproductive organs; low concentrations occur in CSF; it crosses the placenta, and enters breast milk\n\n=== Protein binding ===\n* imipenem: 13\u201321%\n* cilastatin, 40%\n\n=== Metabolism ===\nImipenem is metabolized in the kidney by dehydropeptidase 1; activity is blocked by cilastatin.\n\n=== Elimination ===\nHalf-life (both drugs): 60 min; prolonged with renal impairment.\nExcretion (both drugs): Urine (~70% as unchanged drug)\n\n==Availability and description==\nPrimaxin [[intravenous|IV]] is a combination of imipenem, cilastatin sodium, and [[sodium bicarbonate]] which is added as a buffer.<ref

Imipenem/cilastatin is indicated for the treatment of severe or complicated skin, tissue, joint, respiratory tract, intra-abdominal, urinary tract and urogenital infections, but not meningitis (as it does not pass through the blood brain barrier), endocarditis, and sepsis due to susceptible organisms. Its use is generally restricted to severe infections largely in hospitalized patients. The recommended dosage is 250&nbsp;mg to 1 gram given intravenously every 6 to 8 hours or in intramuscular doses of no more than 1.5 gm daily, usually for five to 14 days. It is commercially available as Primaxin as 250-mg or 500-mg infusion bottles for IV use or 500-mg or 750-mg vials of lyophilized powder for IM injection. The most common side effects of imipenem are diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, skin rash, [[pruritus]], and injection-site reactions.\n\n==Pharmacology==\n\n=== Mechanism of action ===\nImipenem inhibits bacterial cell-wall synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins; cilastatin prevents renal metabolism of imipenem.\n\n=== Bioavailability ===\nIntramuscular injection:\n* imipenem: 60\u201375%\n* cilastatin: 95\u2013100%\n\n=== Distribution ===\nThe drug is distributed rapidly and widely to most tissues and fluids, including sputum, pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, interstitial fluid, bile, aqueous humor, reproductive organs, and bone; highest concentrations occur in pleural fluid, interstitial fluid, peritoneal fluid, and reproductive organs; low concentrations occur in CSF; it crosses the placenta, and enters breast milk\n\n=== Protein binding ===\n* imipenem: 13\u201321%\n* cilastatin, 40%\n\n=== Metabolism ===\nImipenem is metabolized in the kidney by dehydropeptidase 1; activity is blocked by cilastatin.\n\n=== Elimination ===\nHalf-life (both drugs): 60 min; prolonged with renal impairment.\nExcretion (both drugs): Urine (~70% as unchanged drug)\n\n==Availability and description==\nPrimaxin [[intravenous|IV]] is a combination of imipenem, cilastatin sodium, and [[sodium bicarbonate]] which is added as a buffer.<ref name=\"RxList\"/>\nPrimaxin [[intramuscular|IM]] lacks the sodium bicarbonate buffer.<ref name=\"RxList2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rxlist.com/primaxin-im-drug.htm|title=Primaxin IM|website=RxList|accessdate=January 25, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127031955/http://www.rxlist.com/primaxin-im-drug.htm|archivedate=January 27, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Cell wall disruptive antibiotics}}\n{{portal bar|Pharmacy and pharmacology|Medicine}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Imipenem Cilastatin}}\n[[Category:Combination antibiotics]]\n[[Category:Peripherally selective drugs]]\n[[Category:Merck & Co. brands]]\n[[Category:World Health Organization essential medicines]]\n[[Category:RTT]]\n", "name_user": "Fswitzer4", "label": "safe", "comment": "added FDA UNII to drug box", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imipenem/cilastatin"}

In English translation, he is usually referred to as '''Quintilian''' ({{IPAc-en|k|w|\u026a|n|\u02c8|t|\u026a|l|i|\u0259n}}), although the alternate spellings of '''Quintillian''' and '''Quinctilian''' are occasionally seen, the latter in older texts.\n\n==Life==\nQuintilian was born c. 35 in ''Calagurris'' ([[Calahorra]], [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]]) in [[Hispania]]. His father, a well-educated man, sent him to Rome to study rhetoric early in the reign of [[Nero]]. While there, he cultivated a relationship with [[Domitius Afer]], who died in 59. \"It had always been the custom \u2026 for young men with ambitions in public life to fix upon some older model of their ambition \u2026 and regard him as a mentor\" {{harv|Kennedy|loc=16}}. Quintilian evidently adopted Afer as his model and listened to him speak and plead cases in the law courts. Afer has been characterized as a more austere, classical, Ciceronian speaker than those common at the time of [[Seneca the Younger]], and he may have inspired Quintilian's love of [[Cicero]].\n\nSometime after Afer's death, Quintilian returned to Hispania, possibly to practice law in the courts of his own province. However, in 68, he returned to Rome as part of the retinue of Emperor [[Galba]], Nero's short-lived successor. Quintilian does not appear to have been a close advisor of the Emperor, which probably ensured his survival after the assassination of Galba in 69.\n\nAfter Galba's death, and during the chaotic [[Year of the Four Emperors]] which followed, Quintilian opened a public school of [[rhetoric]]. Among his students were [[Pliny the Younger]], and perhaps [[Tacitus]]. The Emperor [[Vespasian]] made him a ''[[Roman consul|consul]].'' The emperor \"in general was not especially interested in the arts, but \u2026 was interested in education as a means of creating an intelligent and responsible ruling class\" {{harv|Kennedy|loc=19}}. This subsidy enabled Quintilian to devote more time to the school, since it freed him of pressing monetary concerns. In addition, he appeared in the courts of law, arguing on behalf of clients.\n\nOf his personal life, little is known. In the proemium to Book 6 of the ''Institutio Oratoria'', he mentions a wife who died young, as well as two sons who predeceased him.\n\nQuintilian retired from teaching and pleading in 88 {{harv|Reid|1911}}, during the reign of [[Domitian]]. His retirement may have been prompted by his achievement of financial security and his desire to become a gentleman of leisure. Quintilian survived several emperors; the reigns of Vespasian and [[Titus]] were relatively peaceful, but that of Domitian was reputed to be difficult. Domitian's cruelty and paranoia may have prompted the rhetorician to distance himself quietly. The emperor does not appear to have taken offence as he made Quintilian tutor of his two grand-nephews in 90 AD.  He is believed to have died sometime around 100, not having long survived Domitian, who was assassinated in 96 {{harv|Quintilianus|2016|loc={{Page needed|date=February 2020}}}}.\n\n==Works==\nThe only extant work of Quintilian is a twelve-volume textbook on rhetoric entitled ''[[Institutio Oratoria]]'' (generally referred to in English as the ''Institutes of Oratory''), published around AD 95. This work deals not only with the theory and practice of rhetoric, but also with the foundational education and development of the [[orator]] himself, providing advice that ran from the cradle to the grave. An earlier text, ''De Causis Corruptae Eloquentiae'' (\"On the Causes of Corrupted Eloquence\") has been lost, but is believed to have been \"a preliminary exposition of some of the views later set forth in [''Institutio Oratoria'']\" {{harv|Kennedy|loc=24}}.\n\nIn addition, there are two sets of declamations, ''Declamationes Maiores'' and ''Declamationes Minores'', which have been attributed to Quintilian. However, there is some dispute over the real writer of these texts: \"Some modern scholars believe that the declamations circulated in his name represent the lecture notes of a scholar either using Quintilian's system or actually trained by him\" {{harv|Murphy|loc=XVII\u2013XVIII}}.\n\n==''Institutio Oratoria''==\n{{main|Institutio Oratoria}}\n[[File:Quintilian, Institutio oratoria ed. Burman (Leiden 1720), frontispiece.jpg|thumb|[[Book frontispiece|Frontispiece]] of a 1720 edition of the ''Institutio Oratoria'', showing Quintilan teaching rhetoric]]\n\n''Institutio Oratoria'' (English: ''Institutes of Oratory'') is a twelve-volume textbook on the theory and practice of [[rhetoric]] by Roman rhetorician Quintilian. It was published around year 95 AD. The work deals also with the foundational education and development of the [[orator]] himself. In this work, Quintilian establishes that the perfect orator is first a good man, and after that he is a good speaker {{harv|Golden, Berquist, Coleman, and Sproule|loc={{Page needed|date=February 2020}}}}. He also believed that a speech should stay genuine to a message that is \"just and honorable\" {{harv|Golden, Berquist, Coleman, and Sproule|loc={{Page needed|date=February 2020}}}}. Coherently, this came to be known as his good man theory, embracing the message that if one cannot be genuinely good, then one cannot be a good speaker for the people. This theory also revolves around being of service to the people. A good man is one who works for the good of the people and the prosperity of society.\n\nQuintilian published ''Institutio Oratoria'' in the last years of [[Domitian]]\u2019s rule of the empire.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} He had worked alongside Domitian, but as he began to write more and ease away from Emperor Domitian\u2019s complete power, the emperor did not seem to mind as he was so impressed with Quintilian, he hired him to be a tutor for his family because of Quintilian\u2019s devotion to education. Domitian was in the harshest period of his rule, and almost no one had the courage to speak any idea that was unlike his, but Quintilian did {{harv|Gideon}}. He spoke as an orator in the tradition of Cicero, such as had not been seen since the beginning of the reign of [[Augustus]] {{harv|Gideon}}. Rather than pleading cases, as an orator of his era might have been expected to do, he concentrated on speaking in more general terms about how sound rhetoric influences the education of the people.\n\n== Placement of Quintilian's rhetoric ==\n\nQuintilian cites many authors in the ''Institutio Oratoria'' before providing his own definition of [[rhetoric]] {{harv|Quintilianus|1920|loc=10.1.3}}. His rhetoric is chiefly defined by [[Cato the Elder]]\u2019s ''vir bonus, dicendi peritus'', or \u201cthe good man skilled at speaking\u201d {{harv|Quintilian|loc=12.1.1}}. Later he states: \u201cI should like the orator I am training to be a sort of Roman Wise Man\u201d {{harv|Quintilianus|1920|loc=12.2.7}}. Quintilian also \u201cinsists that his ideal orator is no philosopher because the philosopher does not take as a duty participation in civic life; this is constitutive of Quintilian's (and [[Isocrates]]' and [[Cicero]]'s) ideal orator\" {{harv|Walzer|loc=26}}. Though he calls for [[Dionysian imitatio|imitation]], he also urges the orator to use this knowledge to inspire his own original invention {{harv|Quintilianus|1920|loc=10.2.4}}.\n\nNo author receives greater praise in the ''Institutio Oratoria'' than Cicero: \"For who can instruct with greater thoroughness, or more deeply stir the emotions? Who has ever possessed such a gift of charm?\" {{harv|Quintilianus|1920|loc=10.1.110}}. Quintilian's definition of rhetoric shares many similarities with that of Cicero, one being the importance of the speaker's moral character {{harv|Logie|loc={{Page needed|date=March 2017}}}}. Like Cicero, Quintilian also believes that \u201chistory and philosophy can increase an orator\u2019s command of ''copia'' and style;\" they differ in that Quintilian \u201cfeatures the character of the orator, as well as the art\u201d {{harv|Walzer|loc=36\u201337}}.\n\nIn Book II, Quintilian sides with [[Plato]]\u2019s assertion in the ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'' that the rhetorician must be just: \u201cIn the ''Phaedrus'', Plato makes it even clearer that the complete attainment of this art is even impossible without the knowledge of justice, an opinion in which I heartily concur\" {{harv|Quintilianus|1920|loc= 2.15.29}}. Their views are further similar in their treatment of \u201c(1) the inseparability, in more respects than one, of wisdom, goodness, and eloquence; and (2) the morally ideological nature of rhetoric. [...] For both, there are conceptual connections between rhetoric and justice which rule out the possibility of [an] amorally neutral conception of rhetoric. For both, rhetoric is \u2018speaking well,\u2019 and for both \u2018speaking well\u2019 means speaking justly\" {{harv|Logie|loc=371}}.\n\n==Influence of Quintilian==\nThe influence of Quintilian's masterwork, ''Institutio Oratoria'', can be felt in several areas. First of all, there is his criticism of the orator [[Seneca the Younger]]. Quintilian was attempting to modify the prevailing imperial style of oratory with his book, and Seneca was the principal figure in that style's tradition. He was more recent than many of the authors mentioned by Quintilian, but his reputation within the post-classical style necessitated both his mention and the criticism or back-handed praise that is given to him. Quintilian believed that \u201chis style is for the most part corrupt and extremely dangerous because it abounds in attractive faults\u201d {{harv|Quintilianus|1920|loc=10.1.129}}. Seneca was regarded as doubly dangerous because his style was sometimes attractive. This reading of Seneca \u201chas heavily coloured subsequent judgments of Seneca and his style\" {{harv|Dominik|loc=51}}.\n\nQuintilian also made an impression on [[Martial]], the Latin poet. A short poem, published in 86, was addressed to him, and opened, \"Quintilian, greatest director of straying youth, / you are an honour, Quintilian, to the Roman toga\". However, one should not take Martial's praise at face value, since he was known for his sly and witty insults. The opening lines are all that are usually quoted, but the rest of the poem contains lines such as \"A man who longs to surpass his father\u2019s census rating\" (6).{{full citation needed|date=April 2017}} This speaks of Quintilian's ambitious side and his drive for wealth and position.\n\nAfter his death, Quintilian's influence fluctuated. He was mentioned by his pupil, Pliny, and by [[Juvenal]], who may have been another student, \u201cas an example of sobriety and of worldly success unusual in the teaching profession\u201d {{harv|Gwynn|loc=139}}. During the 3rd to 5th centuries, his influence was felt among such authors as [[St. Augustine of Hippo]], whose discussion of signs and figurative language certainly owed something to Quintilian, and to [[St. Jerome]], editor of the [[Vulgate Bible]], whose theories on education are clearly influenced by Quintilian's. The [[Middle Ages]] saw a decline in knowledge of his work, since existing manuscripts of ''Institutio Oratoria'' were fragmented, but the Italian [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]] revived interest in the work after the discovery by [[Poggio Bracciolini]] in 1416 of a forgotten, complete manuscript in the monastery of [[St. Gall]], which he found \"buried in rubbish and dust\" in a filthy dungeon. The influential scholar [[Leonardo Bruni]], considered the first modern historian, greeted the news by writing to his friend Poggio: <blockquote>\nIt will be your glory to restore to the present age, by your labour and diligence, the writings of excellent authors, which have hitherto escaped the researches of the learned... Oh! what a valuable acquisition! What an unexpected pleasure! Shall I then behold Quintilian whole and entire, who, even in his imperfect state, was so rich a source of delight?... But Quintilian is so consummate a master of rhetoric and oratory, that when, after having delivered him from his long imprisonment in the dungeons of the barbarians, you transmit him to this country, all the nations of Italy ought to assemble to bid him welcome... Quintilian, an author whose works I will not hesitate to affirm, are more an object of desire to the learned than any others, excepting only Cicero's dissertation ''De Republica.'' {{harv|Shepherd|loc=chapter 3, pp. 95\u201397}}</blockquote>The Italian poet [[Petrarch]] addressed one of his letters to the dead to Quintilian, and for many he \u201cprovided the inspiration for a new humanistic philosophy of education\u201d {{harv|Gwynn|loc=140}}. This enthusiasm for Quintilian spread with humanism itself, reaching northern Europe in the 15th and 16th centuries. [[Martin Luther]], the German theologian and ecclesiastical reformer, \"claimed that he preferred Quintilian to almost all authors, 'in that he educates and at the same time demonstrates eloquence, that is, he teaches in word and in deed most happily'\" {{harv|Gwynn|loc=140}}. The influence of Quintilian's works is also seen in Luther's contemporary [[Erasmus]] of Rotterdam. He above all shaped the implicit depth of humanism and had studied at Steyn.\n\nIt has been argued by a musicologist, Ursula {{harvtxt|Kirkendale|loc=Page needed}} that the composition of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s ''Das Musikalische Opfer'' ([[The Musical Offering]], BWV 1079), was closely connected with the ''Institutio Oratoria''. Among Bach's duties during his tenure at Leipzig (1723\u20131750) was teaching Latin; his early training included rhetoric. (Philologist and Rector of the Leipzig Thomasschule, [[Johann Matthias Gesner]], for whom Bach composed a cantata in 1729, published a substantial Quintilian edition with a long footnote in Bach's honor.)\n\nAfter this high point, Quintilian's influence seems to have lessened somewhat, although he is mentioned by the English poet [[Alexander Pope]] in his versified ''An Essay on Criticism'':\n\n<blockquote><poem>In grave Quintilian\u2019s copious works we find\nThe justest rules and clearest method join\u2019d (lines 669\u201370).</poem></blockquote>\n\nIn addition, \u201che is often mentioned by writers like [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]] and [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]]... but he made no major contribution to intellectual history, and by the nineteenth century he seemed to be... rather little read and rarely edited\u201d {{harv|Gwynn|loc=140\u201341}}. However, in his celebrated ''Autobiography,'' [[John Stuart Mill]] (arguably the nineteenth-century's most influential English intellectual) spoke highly of Quintilian as a force in his early education. He wrote that Quintilian, while little-read in Mill's day due to \"his obscure style and to the scholastic details of which many parts of his treatise are made up,\" was \"seldom sufficiently appreciated.\" \"His book,\" Mill continued, \"is a kind of encyclopaedia of the thoughts of the ancients on the whole field of education and culture; and I have retained through life many valuable ideas which I can distinctly trace to my reading of him...\" {{harv|Mill|loc={{Page needed|date=February 2020}}}}. He was also highly praised by [[Thomas De Quincey]]: \"[F]or elegance and as a practical model in the art he was expounding, neither Aristotle, nor any less austere among the Greek rhetoricians, has any pretensions to measure himself with Quintilian. In reality, for a triumph over the difficulties of the subject, and as a lesson on the possibility of imparting grace to the treatment of scholastic topics, naturally as intractable as that of Grammar or Prosody, there is no such chef-d'oeuvre to this hour in any literature, as the Institutions of Quintilian\" {{harv|De Quincey|loc=40}}. In more recent times, Quintilian appears to have made another upward turn. He is frequently included in anthologies of literary criticism, and is an integral part of the history of education. He is believed to be the \"earliest spokesman for a child-centered education\" (141),{{full citation needed|date=April 2017}} which is discussed above under his [[early childhood education]] theories. As well, he has something to offer students of speech, professional writing, and rhetoric, because of the great detail with which he covers the rhetorical system. His discussions of [[trope (literature)|tropes]] and figures also formed the foundation of contemporary works on the nature of figurative language, including the [[post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] and [[formalism (literature)|formalist]] theories. For example, the works of [[Jacques Derrida]] on the failure of language to impart the truth of the objects it is meant to represent would not be possible without Quintilian's assumptions about the function of figurative language and tropes {{harv|Gunderson|loc=38}}.{{Failed verification|date=February 2020|reason=Source does not say that Derrida's works would not be possible without Quintilian, but merely that \"Quintilian reads in a manner that evokes the ideas of Derrida on the problems of reading and writing in Western philosophy.\"}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Quadripartita ratio]]\n* [[Dionysian imitatio]]\n\n==References==\n* {{wikicite|ref={{harvid|De Quincey}}|reference=De Quincey, Thomas.

In English translation, he is usually referred to as '''Quintilian''' ({{IPAc-en|k|w|\u026a|n|\u02c8|t|\u026a|l|i|\u0259n}}), although the alternate spellings of '''Quintillian''' and '''Quinctilian''' are occasionally seen, the latter in older texts.\n\n==Life==\nQuintilian was born c. 35 in ''Calagurris'' ([[Calahorra]], [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]]) in [[Hispania]]. His father, a well-educated man, sent him to Rome to study rhetoric early in the reign of [[Nero]]. While there, he cultivated a relationship with [[Domitius Afer]], who died in 59. \"It had always been the custom \u2026 for young men with ambitions in public life to fix upon some older model of their ambition \u2026 and regard him as a mentor\" {{harv|Kennedy|loc=16}}. Quintilian evidently adopted Afer as his model and listened to him speak and plead cases in the law courts. Afer has been characterized as a more austere, classical, Ciceronian speaker than those common at the time of [[Seneca the Younger]], and he may have inspired Quintilian's love of [[Cicero]].\n\nSometime after Afer's death, Quintilian returned to Hispania, possibly to practice law in the courts of his own province. However, in 68, he returned to Rome as part of the retinue of Emperor [[Galba]], Nero's short-lived successor. Quintilian does not appear to have been a close advisor of the Emperor, which probably ensured his survival after the assassination of Galba in 69.\n\nAfter Galba's death, and during the chaotic [[Year of the Four Emperors]] which followed, Quintilian opened a public school of [[rhetoric]]. Among his students were [[Pliny the Younger]], and perhaps [[Tacitus]]. The Emperor [[Vespasian]] made him a ''[[Roman consul|consul]].'' The emperor \"in general was not especially interested in the arts, but \u2026 was interested in education as a means of creating an intelligent and responsible ruling class\" {{harv|Kennedy|loc=19}}. This subsidy enabled Quintilian to devote more time to the school, since it freed him of pressing monetary concerns. In addition, he appeared in the courts of law, arguing on behalf of clients.\n\nOf his personal life, little is known. In the ''Institutio Oratoria'', he mentions a wife who died young, as well as two sons who predeceased him.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nQuintilian retired from teaching and pleading in 88 {{harv|Reid|1911}}, during the reign of [[Domitian]]. His retirement may have been prompted by his achievement of financial security and his desire to become a gentleman of leisure. Quintilian survived several emperors; the reigns of Vespasian and [[Titus]] were relatively peaceful, but that of Domitian was reputed to be difficult. Domitian's cruelty and paranoia may have prompted the rhetorician to distance himself quietly. The emperor does not appear to have taken offence as he made Quintilian tutor of his two grand-nephews in 90 AD.  He is believed to have died sometime around 100, not having long survived Domitian, who was assassinated in 96 {{harv|Quintilianus|2016|loc={{Page needed|date=February 2020}}}}.\n\n==Works==\nThe only extant work of Quintilian is a twelve-volume textbook on rhetoric entitled ''[[Institutio Oratoria]]'' (generally referred to in English as the ''Institutes of Oratory''), published around AD 95. This work deals not only with the theory and practice of rhetoric, but also with the foundational education and development of the [[orator]] himself, providing advice that ran from the cradle to the grave. An earlier text, ''De Causis Corruptae Eloquentiae'' (\"On the Causes of Corrupted Eloquence\") has been lost, but is believed to have been \"a preliminary exposition of some of the views later set forth in [''Institutio Oratoria'']\" {{harv|Kennedy|loc=24}}.\n\nIn addition, there are two sets of declamations, ''Declamationes Maiores'' and ''Declamationes Minores'', which have been attributed to Quintilian. However, there is some dispute over the real writer of these texts: \"Some modern scholars believe that the declamations circulated in his name represent the lecture notes of a scholar either using Quintilian's system or actually trained by him\" {{harv|Murphy|loc=XVII\u2013XVIII}}.\n\n==''Institutio Oratoria''==\n{{main|Institutio Oratoria}}\n[[File:Quintilian, Institutio oratoria ed.

A good man is one who works for the good of the people and the prosperity of society.\n\nQuintilian published ''Institutio Oratoria'' in the last years of [[Domitian]]\u2019s rule of the empire.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} He had worked alongside Domitian, but as he began to write more and ease away from Emperor Domitian\u2019s complete power, the emperor did not seem to mind as he was so impressed with Quintilian, he hired him to be a tutor for his family because of Quintilian\u2019s devotion to education. Domitian was in the harshest period of his rule, and almost no one had the courage to speak any idea that was unlike his, but Quintilian did {{harv|Gideon}}. He spoke as an orator in the tradition of Cicero, such as had not been seen since the beginning of the reign of [[Augustus]] {{harv|Gideon}}. Rather than pleading cases, as an orator of his era might have been expected to do, he concentrated on speaking in more general terms about how sound rhetoric influences the education of the people.\n\n== Placement of Quintilian's rhetoric ==\n\nQuintilian cites many authors in the ''Institutio Oratoria'' before providing his own definition of [[rhetoric]] {{harv|Quintilianus|1920|loc=10.1.3}}. His rhetoric is chiefly defined by [[Cato the Elder]]\u2019s ''vir bonus, dicendi peritus'', or \u201cthe good man skilled at speaking\u201d {{harv|Quintilian|loc=12.1.1}}. Later he states: \u201cI should like the orator I am training to be a sort of Roman Wise Man\u201d {{harv|Quintilianus|1920|loc=12.2.7}}. Quintilian also \u201cinsists that his ideal orator is no philosopher because the philosopher does not take as a duty participation in civic life; this is constitutive of Quintilian's (and [[Isocrates]]' and [[Cicero]]'s) ideal orator\" {{harv|Walzer|loc=26}}. Though he calls for [[Dionysian imitatio|imitation]], he also urges the orator to use this knowledge to inspire his own original invention {{harv|Quintilianus|1920|loc=10.2.4}}.\n\nNo author receives greater praise in the ''Institutio Oratoria'' than Cicero: \"For who can instruct with greater thoroughness, or more deeply stir the emotions? Who has ever possessed such a gift of charm?\" {{harv|Quintilianus|1920|loc=10.1.110}}. Quintilian's definition of rhetoric shares many similarities with that of Cicero, one being the importance of the speaker's moral character {{harv|Logie|loc={{Page needed|date=March 2017}}}}. Like Cicero, Quintilian also believes that \u201chistory and philosophy can increase an orator\u2019s command of ''copia'' and style;\" they differ in that Quintilian \u201cfeatures the character of the orator, as well as the art\u201d {{harv|Walzer|loc=36\u201337}}.\n\nIn Book II, Quintilian sides with [[Plato]]\u2019s assertion in the ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'' that the rhetorician must be just: \u201cIn the ''Phaedrus'', Plato makes it even clearer that the complete attainment of this art is even impossible without the knowledge of justice, an opinion in which I heartily concur\" {{harv|Quintilianus|1920|loc= 2.15.29}}. Their views are further similar in their treatment of \u201c(1) the inseparability, in more respects than one, of wisdom, goodness, and eloquence; and (2) the morally ideological nature of rhetoric. [...] For both, there are conceptual connections between rhetoric and justice which rule out the possibility of [an] amorally neutral conception of rhetoric. For both, rhetoric is \u2018speaking well,\u2019 and for both \u2018speaking well\u2019 means speaking justly\" {{harv|Logie|loc=371}}.\n\n==Influence of Quintilian==\nThe influence of Quintilian's masterwork, ''Institutio Oratoria'', can be felt in several areas. First of all, there is his criticism of the orator [[Seneca the Younger]]. Quintilian was attempting to modify the prevailing imperial style of oratory with his book, and Seneca was the principal figure in that style's tradition. He was more recent than many of the authors mentioned by Quintilian, but his reputation within the post-classical style necessitated both his mention and the criticism or back-handed praise that is given to him. Quintilian believed that \u201chis style is for the most part corrupt and extremely dangerous because it abounds in attractive faults\u201d {{harv|Quintilianus|1920|loc=10.1.129}}. Seneca was regarded as doubly dangerous because his style was sometimes attractive. This reading of Seneca \u201chas heavily coloured subsequent judgments of Seneca and his style\" {{harv|Dominik|loc=51}}.\n\nQuintilian also made an impression on [[Martial]], the Latin poet. A short poem, published in 86, was addressed to him, and opened, \"Quintilian, greatest director of straying youth, / you are an honour, Quintilian, to the Roman toga\". However, one should not take Martial's praise at face value, since he was known for his sly and witty insults. The opening lines are all that are usually quoted, but the rest of the poem contains lines such as \"A man who longs to surpass his father\u2019s census rating\" (6).{{full citation needed|date=April 2017}} This speaks of Quintilian's ambitious side and his drive for wealth and position.\n\nAfter his death, Quintilian's influence fluctuated. He was mentioned by his pupil, Pliny, and by [[Juvenal]], who may have been another student, \u201cas an example of sobriety and of worldly success unusual in the teaching profession\u201d {{harv|Gwynn|loc=139}}. During the 3rd to 5th centuries, his influence was felt among such authors as [[St. Augustine of Hippo]], whose discussion of signs and figurative language certainly owed something to Quintilian, and to [[St. Jerome]], editor of the [[Vulgate Bible]], whose theories on education are clearly influenced by Quintilian's. The [[Middle Ages]] saw a decline in knowledge of his work, since existing manuscripts of ''Institutio Oratoria'' were fragmented, but the Italian [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]] revived interest in the work after the discovery by [[Poggio Bracciolini]] in 1416 of a forgotten, complete manuscript in the monastery of [[St. Gall]], which he found \"buried in rubbish and dust\" in a filthy dungeon. The influential scholar [[Leonardo Bruni]], considered the first modern historian, greeted the news by writing to his friend Poggio: <blockquote>\nIt will be your glory to restore to the present age, by your labour and diligence, the writings of excellent authors, which have hitherto escaped the researches of the learned... Oh! what a valuable acquisition! What an unexpected pleasure! Shall I then behold Quintilian whole and entire, who, even in his imperfect state, was so rich a source of delight?... But Quintilian is so consummate a master of rhetoric and oratory, that when, after having delivered him from his long imprisonment in the dungeons of the barbarians, you transmit him to this country, all the nations of Italy ought to assemble to bid him welcome... Quintilian, an author whose works I will not hesitate to affirm, are more an object of desire to the learned than any others, excepting only Cicero's dissertation ''De Republica.'' {{harv|Shepherd|loc=chapter 3, pp. 95\u201397}}</blockquote>The Italian poet [[Petrarch]] addressed one of his letters to the dead to Quintilian, and for many he \u201cprovided the inspiration for a new humanistic philosophy of education\u201d {{harv|Gwynn|loc=140}}. This enthusiasm for Quintilian spread with humanism itself, reaching northern Europe in the 15th and 16th centuries. [[Martin Luther]], the German theologian and ecclesiastical reformer, \"claimed that he preferred Quintilian to almost all authors, 'in that he educates and at the same time demonstrates eloquence, that is, he teaches in word and in deed most happily'\" {{harv|Gwynn|loc=140}}. The influence of Quintilian's works is also seen in Luther's contemporary [[Erasmus]] of Rotterdam. He above all shaped the implicit depth of humanism and had studied at Steyn.\n\nIt has been argued by a musicologist, Ursula {{harvtxt|Kirkendale|loc=Page needed}} that the composition of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s ''Das Musikalische Opfer'' ([[The Musical Offering]], BWV 1079), was closely connected with the ''Institutio Oratoria''. Among Bach's duties during his tenure at Leipzig (1723\u20131750) was teaching Latin; his early training included rhetoric. (Philologist and Rector of the Leipzig Thomasschule, [[Johann Matthias Gesner]], for whom Bach composed a cantata in 1729, published a substantial Quintilian edition with a long footnote in Bach's honor.)\n\nAfter this high point, Quintilian's influence seems to have lessened somewhat, although he is mentioned by the English poet [[Alexander Pope]] in his versified ''An Essay on Criticism'':\n\n<blockquote><poem>In grave Quintilian\u2019s copious works we find\nThe justest rules and clearest method join\u2019d (lines 669\u201370).</poem></blockquote>\n\nIn addition, \u201che is often mentioned by writers like [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]] and [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]]... but he made no major contribution to intellectual history, and by the nineteenth century he seemed to be... rather little read and rarely edited\u201d {{harv|Gwynn|loc=140\u201341}}. However, in his celebrated ''Autobiography,'' [[John Stuart Mill]] (arguably the nineteenth-century's most influential English intellectual) spoke highly of Quintilian as a force in his early education. He wrote that Quintilian, while little-read in Mill's day due to \"his obscure style and to the scholastic details of which many parts of his treatise are made up,\" was \"seldom sufficiently appreciated.\" \"His book,\" Mill continued, \"is a kind of encyclopaedia of the thoughts of the ancients on the whole field of education and culture; and I have retained through life many valuable ideas which I can distinctly trace to my reading of him...\" {{harv|Mill|loc={{Page needed|date=February 2020}}}}. He was also highly praised by [[Thomas De Quincey]]: \"[F]or elegance and as a practical model in the art he was expounding, neither Aristotle, nor any less austere among the Greek rhetoricians, has any pretensions to measure himself with Quintilian. In reality, for a triumph over the difficulties of the subject, and as a lesson on the possibility of imparting grace to the treatment of scholastic topics, naturally as intractable as that of Grammar or Prosody, there is no such chef-d'oeuvre to this hour in any literature, as the Institutions of Quintilian\" {{harv|De Quincey|loc=40}}. In more recent times, Quintilian appears to have made another upward turn. He is frequently included in anthologies of literary criticism, and is an integral part of the history of education. He is believed to be the \"earliest spokesman for a child-centered education\" (141),{{full citation needed|date=April 2017}} which is discussed above under his [[early childhood education]] theories. As well, he has something to offer students of speech, professional writing, and rhetoric, because of the great detail with which he covers the rhetorical system. His discussions of [[trope (literature)|tropes]] and figures also formed the foundation of contemporary works on the nature of figurative language, including the [[post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] and [[formalism (literature)|formalist]] theories. For example, the works of [[Jacques Derrida]] on the failure of language to impart the truth of the objects it is meant to represent would not be possible without Quintilian's assumptions about the function of figurative language and tropes {{harv|Gunderson|loc=38}}.{{Failed verification|date=February 2020|reason=Source does not say that Derrida's works would not be possible without Quintilian, but merely that \"Quintilian reads in a manner that evokes the ideas of Derrida on the problems of reading and writing in Western philosophy.\"}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Quadripartita ratio]]\n* [[Dionysian imitatio]]\n\n==References==\n* {{wikicite|ref={{harvid|De Quincey}}|reference=De Quincey, Thomas.

In 2006, Ver\u00f3n returned to Estudiantes, where he remained until his retirement in 2014, aside from a brief spell with [[Asociaci\u00f3n Coronel Brandsen|Brandsen]]. He announced his short return to first team football would occur in the [[2017 Copa Libertadores]].\n\nAt international level, Ver\u00f3n obtained 73 caps for [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] between 1996 and 2010, scoring 9 goals. He represented his nation at three [[FIFA World Cup]]s, and at the [[2007 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], where he won a runners-up medal.\n\nIn 2004, he was included in the [[FIFA 100]] centenary list of the 125 greatest living footballers, selected by [[Pel\u00e9]] as part of FIFA's centenary celebrations.

He made his international debut for [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] against [[Poland national football team|Poland]] in the same year.

The following year, Parma won the [[1998\u201399 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]] and the [[1999 UEFA Cup Final|UEFA Cup]]. Eriksson then signed him again, this time for [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] in an \u00a318.1-million deal, with Ver\u00f3n reportedly netting a weekly wage of \u00a348,000.

His transfer fee to Chelsea was about half that of his record-breaking transfer of just two years before.\n\nVer\u00f3n made an excellent start to his Chelsea career by scoring the opening goal in a 2\u20131 victory over [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] at [[Anfield]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/3140907.stm|title=Hasselbaink sinks Liverpool|publisher=BBC|date=17 August 2003 |accessdate=4 November 2009}}</ref> but he fell away with injury problems as the [[2003\u201304 Chelsea F.C. season|2003\u201304 season]] progressed and made only 15 appearances for Chelsea.\n\n''[[The Times]]'' listed Ver\u00f3n's transfers to Manchester United and Chelsea among the 50 worst transfers ever in Premiership history.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article2096584.ece |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080727003744/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article2096584.ece |url-status=dead |archive-date=27 July 2008 |work=The Times |location=London |title=The 50 worst transfers |first=Bill |last=Edgar |date=18 July 2007 |accessdate=7 May 2010 }}</ref> His several big-money transfers made Ver\u00f3n, at the time, the most expensive footballer in history, with a cumulative total of \u00a377 million.\n\n===Return to Italy===\n[[File:Juan seba veron.JPG|thumb|upright|Ver\u00f3n in training for [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]]]]\nWhen [[Jos\u00e9 Mourinho]] took over as Chelsea manager the following season, Ver\u00f3n was loaned out to [[Internazionale Milano F.C.|Internazionale]] initially for [[2004\u201305 Serie A|2004\u201305]], but he subsequently returned to Inter on loan for a further season. With Inter, he was part of the squad that won the [[2005 Coppa Italia Final|2005 Coppa Italia]], [[2006 Coppa Italia Final|2006 Coppa Italia]], and also by default the [[2005\u201306 Serie A|2006 Serie A]] title after [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] were stripped of the title for a [[2006 Italian football scandal|match fixing scandal]].\n\n===Returning home===\nIn mid-2006, Ver\u00f3n made it known that he wished to return to his native Argentina for the 2006\u201307 season. He received offers from [[Boca Juniors]] and [[Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate|River Plate]], but chose his boyhood club [[Estudiantes de La Plata]], of whom he is a declared fan and has made significant donations in the past to upgrade the club training facilities. Chelsea agreed to loan Ver\u00f3n to Estudiantes for a season, until the end of his contract with the English club. On 13 December 2006, he helped Estudiantes win the [[2006\u201307 in Argentine football|Apertura 2006]] tournament, its first in 23 years, in a final play-off match final over Boca Juniors. Some rival fans booed him, arguably dating back to his sub-par performances during the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], but Ver\u00f3n was ranked among the top three players in the 2006 Argentine League by sports newspaper ''Ol\u00e9''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Nunca pens\u00e9 en renunciar a la Selecci\u00f3n|url=http://www.ole.clarin.com/jsp/v4/pagina.jsp?pagId=01302317&fecha=20061103|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316153904/http://www.ole.clarin.com/jsp/v4/pagina.jsp?pagId=01302317&fecha=20061103|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 March 2009|publisher=[[Diario Ol\u00e9|Ol\u00e9]]|date=3 November 2006|language=Spanish}}</ref>\n\nFollowing his donations to the club's training grounds, Ver\u00f3n was a decisive factor in the agreement with La Plata city hall to update Estudiantes' historic stadium to modern standards.

After displaying his usual excellent level of play throughout the tournament, he found himself leading Estudiantes into the [[2009 Copa Libertadores Finals|final]] for the first time since 1971.

Stamps have been produced both for postage and for service or revenue. Definitives and commemoratives have been issued. Stamps have been produced both as unperforated sheets, perforated and miniature sheets. The stamps have been produced in a number of shapes - the [[Scinde Dawk]] being rounded and some, like the stamp on the [[Bombay Sappers]] being triangular. Recently the 2009 stamp on Louis Braille had [[braille]] imprinting on it in addition. Many cases of overprinting exist - for converting the use of domestic postage stamps to service; to earmark stamps sold by field post offices attached with international control commissions and other reasons.\n\nThe [[Indian Postal Service]] has issued stamps on many themes - relating to history, architecture, nature, culture and heritage. Provisions exist for organisations and interested bodies to suggest the printing of special commemorative stamps as well as first day covers and cancellations. The Indian Post runs philatelic bureaus, operates deposit based philatelic services, a philatelic magazine and also publishes lists of stamps from time to time.\n\nThe article lists the stamps in two sections - Indian postage before and after independence. Stamps belonging to convention and feudatory states have been excluded.\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Stamps produced in British India==\n<!--{{main|List of postage stamps of British India}}-->\nThough British rule in India began effectively in the mid-eighteenth century i.e.1860's, the first adhesive stamp was issued in 1852, 12 years after the first [[Penny Black]] was issued in England. This was the Scinde Dawk.  It was followed by the East India company lithographed issues and a long series of engraved stamps portraying Queen Victoria, King Edward VII, King George V, and King George VI.\n\n==Stamps produced in independent India==\n<!--{{main|List of postage stamps of independent India}}-->\nIndia's independence saw the postal department issue its first stamp on 21 Nov 1947 depicting the Indian flag. The Dominion of India issued stamps from 1947 to 1949 with the caption of ''INDIA POSTAGE''. In 1950, India became a republic and the first stamps of India as a republic were a series of four issued on that very day. The stamp issues continued to be in Annas (abbreviated as \"As\") till 1957, when the [[Indian rupee]] was [[decimalisation|decimalised]]: the rupee was divided into 100 naye paise (Hindi for \"new paise\"). In 1964, the initial \"naye\" was dropped. This change in currency is faithfully reflected in the denomination of the stamps of the time. The initial stamps were commemorative or special issues. In 1949 the first definitive \"Archeological\" series of 16 values was issued.\n\n== Types of Postal Stamps ==\nThere are six types<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mintageworld.com/stamp/dynasty/20/|title=Types of Indian Stamps}}</ref> postal stamps are in circulation in India:\n\n* '''Commemorative stamps:''' A commemorative stamp is often issued on a significant date such as an anniversary, to honour or commemorate a place, event, person, or object. The subject of the commemorative stamp is usually spelled out in print. There are numerous commemorative stamps that were issued by India to honour notable personalities like freedom fighters, politicians etc. Many other stamps to celebrate special events related to sports, space, science and technology, defence, arts and crafts etc. showcase the reflections of a vibrant India.[[File:Mahatma Gandhi 1948-1.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|127x127px|<small>Commemorative stamp of Mahatma Gandhi</small>]]\n*'''Republic definitive stamps:''' These stamps are a part of the regular issue and are available for using postage services for an extended period of time. They are designed to serve the everyday postal needs of the country. A definitive issue or series have a range of denominations sufficient to cover ongoing postal rates. Several definitive stamps of India have been issued with different themes and illustrations, depicting art, history, science & technology, nature, vehicles, industries, institutions and more.[[File:1949 definitive stamps (Ajanta Panel) 3P.jpg|left|thumb|113x113px|<small>3 pice stamp of 1949 issue of definitive stamps</small>]]\n*'''Military'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stampexindia.com/category.php?catId=133|title=Stamps of India - Military Issues, Mint & Used}}</ref> '''stamps:''' During the time of war or when peace keeping operations are on, special postage stamps have been issued called as military stamps. Mostly the army itself transports the letters to the desired destinations. These stamps were commonly used during World War II by soldiers who wanted to connect and send their message across to their beloveds. Prior to that and since that, many other military stamps of India have been released for various military operations where Indian Army has made some selfless contributions. These stamps portray different monuments, culture, arts and crafts, personalities and more. The stamps are overprinted to use in foreign on regular definitive stamps by Peace-keeping Armed Forces.[[File:1965-india-15-paise-nehru-medal-rose-stamp.jpg|thumb|117x117px|''The 1965 India 15-paise Nehru Medal and Rose stamp overprinted \u201cUNEF\u201d for use as military stamp by Indian peacekeepers in Gaza during the Suez Crisis (1957-67)''|alt=|left]]\n*'''[[List of Miniature Sheets from India Post|Miniature sheets]]:''' A miniature sheet is a small group of stamps that are still attached to the sheet on which they are printed.

Stamps have been produced both for postage and for service or revenue. Definitives and commemoratives have been issued. Stamps have been produced both as unperforated sheets, perforated and miniature sheets. The stamps have been produced in a number of shapes - the [[Scinde Dawk]] being rounded and some, like the stamp on the [[Bombay Sappers]] being triangular. Recently the 2009 stamp on Louis Braille had [[braille]] imprinting on it in addition. Many cases of overprinting exist - for converting the use of domestic postage stamps to service; to earmark stamps sold by field post offices attached with international control commissions and other reasons.\n\nThe [[Indian Postal Service]] has issued stamps on many themes - relating to history, architecture, nature, culture and heritage. Provisions exist for organisations and interested bodies to suggest the printing of special commemorative stamps as well as first day covers and cancellations. The Indian Post runs philatelic bureaus, operates deposit based philatelic services, a philatelic magazine and also publishes lists of stamps from time to time.\n\nThe article lists the stamps in two sections - Indian postage before and after independence. Stamps belonging to convention and feudatory states have been excluded.\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Stamps produced in British India==\n<!--{{main|List of postage stamps of British India}}-->\nThough British rule in India began effectively in the mid-eighteenth century i.e.1860's, the first adhesive stamp was issued in 1852, 12 years after the first [[Penny Black]] was issued in England. This was the Scinde Dawk.  It was followed by the East India company lithographed issues and a long series of engraved stamps portraying Queen Victoria, King Edward VII, King George V, and King George VI.\n\n==Stamps produced in independent India==\n<!--{{main|List of postage stamps of independent India}}-->\nIndia's independence saw the postal department issue its first stamp on 21 Nov 1947 depicting the Indian flag. The Dominion of India issued stamps from 1947 to 1949 with the caption of ''INDIA POSTAGE''. In 1950, India became a republic and the first stamps of India as a republic were a series of four issued on that very day. The stamp issues continued to be in Annas (abbreviated as \"As\") till 1957, when the [[Indian rupee]] was [[decimalisation|decimalised]]: the rupee was divided into 100 naye paise (Hindi for \"new paise\"). In 1964, the initial \"naye\" was dropped. This change in currency is faithfully reflected in the denomination of the stamps of the time. The initial stamps were commemorative or special issues. In 1949 the first definitive \"Archeological\" series of 16 values was issued.\n\n== Types of Postal Stamps ==\nThere are six types<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mintageworld.com/stamp/dynasty/20/|title=Types of Indian Stamps}}</ref> postal stamps are in circulation in India:\n\n* '''Commemorative stamps:''' A commemorative stamp is often issued on a significant date such as an anniversary, to honour or commemorate a place, event, person, or object. The subject of the commemorative stamp is usually spelled out in print. There are numerous commemorative stamps that were issued by India to honour notable personalities like freedom fighters, politicians etc. Many other stamps to celebrate special events related to sports, space, science and technology, defence, arts and crafts etc. showcase the reflections of a vibrant India.[[File:Mahatma Gandhi 1948-1.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|127x127px|<small>Commemorative stamp of Mahatma Gandhi</small>]]\n*'''Republic definitive stamps:''' These stamps are a part of the regular issue and are available for using postage services for an extended period of time. They are designed to serve the everyday postal needs of the country. A definitive issue or series have a range of denominations sufficient to cover ongoing postal rates. Several definitive stamps of India have been issued with different themes and illustrations, depicting art, history, science & technology, nature, vehicles, industries, institutions and more.[[File:1949 definitive stamps (Ajanta Panel) 3P.jpg|left|thumb|113x113px|<small>3 pice stamp of 1949 issue of definitive stamps</small>]]\n*'''Military'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stampexindia.com/category.php?catId=133|title=Stamps of India - Military Issues, Mint & Used}}</ref> '''stamps:''' During the time of war or when peace keeping operations are on, special postage stamps have been issued called as military stamps. Mostly the army itself transports the letters to the desired destinations. These stamps were commonly used during World War II by soldiers who wanted to connect and send their message across to their beloveds. Prior to that and since that, many other military stamps of India have been released for various military operations where Indian Army has made some selfless contributions. These stamps portray different monuments, culture, arts and crafts, personalities and more. The stamps are overprinted to use in foreign on regular definitive stamps by Peace-keeping Armed Forces.[[File:1965-india-15-paise-nehru-medal-rose-stamp.jpg|thumb|117x117px|''The 1965 India 15-paise Nehru Medal and Rose stamp overprinted \u201cUNEF\u201d for use as military stamp by Indian peacekeepers in Gaza during the Suez Crisis (1957-67)''|alt=|left]]\n*'''[[List of Miniature Sheets from India Post|Miniature sheets]]:''' A miniature sheet is a small group of stamps that are still attached to the sheet on which they are printed.
