The five main groups are ''A'' (tropical), ''B'' (dry), ''C'' (temperate), ''D'' (continental), and ''E'' (polar). Each group and subgroup is represented by a letter. All climates are assigned a main group (the first letter). All climates except for those in the ''E'' group are assigned a seasonal precipitation subgroup (the second letter). For example, ''Af'' indicates a [[tropical rainforest climate]]. The system assigns a temperature subgroup for all groups other than those in the ''A'' group, indicated by the third letter for climates in ''B'', ''C'', and ''D'', and the second letter for climates in ''E''. For example, ''Cfb'' indicates an [[oceanic climate]] with warm summers as indicated by the ending ''b''. Climates are classified based on specific criteria unique to each climate type.<ref name=\"kottek2006\">{{cite journal|last1=Kottek|first1=Markus|last2=Grieser|first2=J\u00fcrgen|last3=Beck|first3=Christoph|last4=Rudolf|first4=Bruno |last5=Rubel|first5=Franz|title=World Map of the K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate classification updated|journal=Meteorologische Zeitschrift|date=2006|volume=15|issue=3|pages=259\u2013263|doi=10.1127/0941-2948/2006/0130|bibcode=2006MetZe..15..259K}}</ref>\n\nAs K\u00f6ppen designed the system based on his experience as a botanist, his main climate groups are based on what types of vegetation grow in a given climate classification region. In addition to identifying climates, the system can be used to analyze ecosystem conditions and identify the main types of vegetation within climates. Due to its link with the plant life of a given region, the system is useful in predicting future changes in plant life within that region.<ref name=\"Beck\"/>\n\nThe K\u00f6ppen climate classification system has been further modified, within the [[Trewartha climate classification]] system in the middle 1960s (revised in 1980). The Trewartha system sought to create a more refined [[Middle latitudes|middle latitude]] climate zone, which was one of the criticisms of the K\u00f6ppen system (the C climate group was too broad).<ref name=\"McKnight\">{{cite book|title=Physical Geography: A Landscape Appreciation|last1=McKnight|first1=Tom L|last2=Hess|first2=Darrel|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2000|isbn=978-0-13-020263-5|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|chapter=Climate Zones and Types|chapter-url-access=registration|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/physicalgeographmckn|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/physicalgeographmckn}}</ref>{{rp|200\u20131}}\n\n{{TOC right}}\n\n== Overview ==\n{|class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|+ K\u00f6ppen climate classification scheme symbols description table<ref name=Beck /><ref name=\"kottek2006\" /><ref name=Peel>{{cite journal |author1=Peel, M.

The term [[season|aseasonal]] refers to the lack in the tropical zone of large differences in daylight hours and mean monthly (or daily) temperature throughout the year. Annual cyclic changes occur in the tropics, but not as predictably as those in the temperate zone, albeit unrelated to temperature, but to water availability whether as rain, mist, soil, or ground water. Plant response (e. g., [[phenology]]), animal (feeding, migration, reproduction, etc.), and human activities (plant sowing, harvesting, hunting, fishing, etc.) are tuned to this 'seasonality'. Indeed, in tropical South America and Central America, the 'rainy season' (and the 'high water season') is called [[rainy season|''invierno'']] or ''inverno'', though it could occur in the Northern Hemisphere summer; likewise, the 'dry season' (and 'low water season') is called [[dry season|''verano'']] or ''ver\u00e3o'', and can occur in the Northern Hemisphere winter).\n\n=== ''Am'': Tropical monsoon climate ===\n{{Main|Tropical monsoon climate}}\nThis type of climate results from the [[monsoon]] winds which change direction according to the seasons.

margins of the [[tropical]] zone from the low teens to the mid-20s latitudes, but occasionally an inner-tropical location (e.g., [[San Marcos, Antioquia]], [[Colombia]]) also qualifies. Actually, the [[Caribbean sea|Caribbean]] coast, eastward from the [[Gulf of Urab\u00e1]] on the [[Colombia]]\u2013[[Panam\u00e1]] border to the [[Orinoco River]] delta, on the [[Atlantic Ocean]] (about 4,000&nbsp;km), have long dry periods (the extreme is the ''BSh'' climate (see below), characterised by very low, unreliable precipitation, present, for instance, in extensive areas in the [[:es:Guajira Pen\u00ednsula|Guajira]], and [[Coro region|Coro]], western [[Venezuela]], the northernmost peninsulas in South America, which receive <300&nbsp;mm total annual precipitation, practically all in two or three months).\n\nThis condition extends to the [[Lesser Antilles]] and [[Greater Antilles]] forming the circum-Caribbean dry belt. The length and severity of the dry season diminishes inland (southward); at the latitude of the Amazon River\u2014which flows eastward, just south of the [[equator]]ial line\u2014the climate is ''Af''. East from the [[Andes]], between the dry, arid Caribbean and the ever-wet Amazon are the Orinoco River's [[Los Llanos, Venezuela|llanos]] or [[savanna]]s, from where this climate takes its name.\n\n==== ''As'': Tropical savanna climate with dry-summer characteristics ====\n\nSometimes ''As'' is used in place of ''Aw'' if the dry season occurs during the time of higher sun and longer days (during summer).<ref name=\"kottek2006\" /><ref name=nwskoppen>{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181224025419/https://www.weather.gov/jetstream/climate_max |archivedate=24 December 2018 |url=https://www.weather.gov/jetstream/climate_max |title=JetStream Max: Addition K\u00f6ppen-Geiger Climate Subdivisions |publisher=National Weather Service |accessdate=24 December 2018}}</ref> This is the case in parts of [[Hawaii]], northwestern Dominican Republic, East Africa, and the Brazilian Northeastern Coast.

These climates occur only in eastern [[Siberia]]. The names of some of the places with this climate have become veritable synonyms for extreme, severe winter cold.\n\n'''Examples'''\n* [[Yakutsk]], [[Sakha Republic]], [[Russia]] (''Dfd'')\n* [[Nizhny Bestyakh]], Sakha Republic, Russia (''Dfd'')\n* [[Verkhoyansk]], Sakha Republic, Russia (''Dfd'')\n* [[Okhotsky-Perevoz]], Sakha Republic, Russia (''Dfd'')\n* [[Oymyakon]], Sakha Republic, Russia (''Dwd'')\n* [[Delyankir]], Sakha Republic, Russia (''Dwd'')\n* [[Allakh-Yun]], Sakha Republic, Russia (''Dwd'')\n* [[Zhigansk]], Sakha Republic, Russia (''Dsd, bordering on Dfd'')\n\n== Group E: Polar climates ==\nIn the K\u00f6ppen climate system, polar climates are defined as the warmest temperature of any month is below 10&nbsp;\u00b0C (50&nbsp;\u00b0F). Polar climates are further divided into two types, tundra climates and icecap climates:\n\n=== ''ET'': Tundra climate ===\n'''[[Tundra]] climate''' (''ET''): Warmest month has an average temperature between 0 and 10&nbsp;\u00b0C. These climates occur on the northern edges of the North American and Eurasian land masses (generally north of 70 \u00b0N although it may be found farther south depending on local conditions), and on nearby islands. ''ET'' climates are also found on some islands near the Antarctic Convergence, and at high elevations outside the polar regions, above the tree line.\n\n'''Examples'''\n* [[Mount Rainier, Washington|Mount Rainier]], Washington, United States (''ET'')\n* [[Macquarie Island]], Australia (''ET'')\n* [[Crozet Islands]] (''ET'')\n* [[Campbell Island, New Zealand|Campbell Island]], [[New Zealand]] (''ET'')\n* [[Kerguelen Islands]] (''ET'')\n* [[Prince Edwards Islands]] (''ET'')\n* [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]], [[Falkland Islands]] (''ET''), borders subpolar oceanic (''Cfc'')\n* [[Ushuaia]], [[Argentina]] (''ET''), (borders on ''Cfc'')\n* [[Mount Wellington (Tasmania)|Mount Wellington]], [[Tasmania]], [[Australia]] (''ET'')\n* [[Mykines, Mykines|Mykines]], [[Faroe Islands]] (''ET''), (borders on ''Cfc'')\n* [[Ben Nevis]], [[Scotland]], [[United Kingdom]] (''ET'')\n* [[Cairn Gorm]], [[Scotland]], [[United Kingdom]] (''ET'')\n\nThese ''ET'' climates are a colder and more continental variants of tundra. They would have characteristics of the ice cap climate, but still manage to see monthly average temperatures above 0&nbsp;\u00b0C (32&nbsp;\u00b0F):\n\n'''Examples'''\n* [[Mount Fuji]], Japan (''ET'')\n* [[Murghab, Tajikistan]] (''ET'')\n* [[Mount Washington, New Hampshire|Mount Washington]], [[New Hampshire]], United States (''ET'')\n* [[Zugspitze]], [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]] (''ET'')\n* [[Eureka, Nunavut]], Canada (''ET'')\n* [[Iqaluit, Nunavut]], Canada (''ET'')\n* [[Inukjuak, Quebec]], Canada (''ET'')\n* [[Nuuk, Greenland|Nuuk]], [[Greenland]] (''ET'')\n* [[Svalbard]], [[Norway]] (''ET'')\n* [[Mys Shmidta]], Russia (''ET'')\n* [[Dikson Island]], Russia (''ET'')\n* [[Novaya Zemlya]], [[Arkhangelsk Oblast]], Russia (''ET'')\n* [[Nord, Greenland|Nord]], Greenland (''ET'')\n* [[Esperanza Base]], [[Antarctica]] (''ET'')\n\n=== ''EF'': Ice cap climate ===\n'''[[Ice cap climate]]''' (''EF''): This climate is dominant in Antarctica and inner Greenland, but also occurs at extremely high altitudes on mountains, above even tundra.

This classification provides an efficient way to describe climatic conditions defined by temperature and precipitation and their seasonality with a single metric.

The five main groups are ''A'' (tropical), ''B'' (dry), ''C'' (temperate), ''D'' (continental), and ''E'' (polar). Each group and subgroup is represented by a letter. All climates are assigned a main group (the first letter). All climates except for those in the ''E'' group are assigned a seasonal precipitation subgroup (the second letter). For example, ''Af'' indicates a [[tropical rainforest climate]]. The system assigns a temperature subgroup for all groups other than those in the ''A'' group, indicated by the third letter for climates in ''B'', ''C'', and ''D'', and the second letter for climates in ''E''. For example, ''Cfb'' indicates an [[oceanic climate]] with warm summers as indicated by the ending ''b''. Climates are classified based on specific criteria unique to each climate type.<ref name=\"kottek2006\">{{cite journal|last1=Kottek|first1=Markus|last2=Grieser|first2=J\u00fcrgen|last3=Beck|first3=Christoph|last4=Rudolf|first4=Bruno |last5=Rubel|first5=Franz|title=World Map of the K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate classification updated|journal=Meteorologische Zeitschrift|date=2006|volume=15|issue=3|pages=259\u2013263|doi=10.1127/0941-2948/2006/0130|bibcode=2006MetZe..15..259K}}</ref>\n\nAs K\u00f6ppen designed the system based on his experience as a botanist, his main climate groups are based on what types of vegetation grow in a given climate classification region. In addition to identifying climates, the system can be used to analyze ecosystem conditions and identify the main types of vegetation within climates. Due to its link with the plant life of a given region, the system is useful in predicting future changes in plant life within that region.<ref name=\"Beck\"/>\n\nThe K\u00f6ppen climate classification system has been further modified, within the [[Trewartha climate classification]] system in the middle 1960s (revised in 1980).

The term [[season|aseasonal]] refers to the lack in the tropical zone of large differences in daylight hours and mean monthly (or daily) temperature throughout the year. Annual cyclic changes occur in the tropics, but not as predictably as those in the temperate zone, albeit unrelated to temperature, but to water availability whether as rain, mist, soil, or ground water. Plant response (e. g., [[phenology]]), animal (feeding, migration, reproduction, etc.), and human activities (plant sowing, harvesting, hunting, fishing, etc.) are tuned to this 'seasonality'. Indeed, in tropical South America and Central America, the 'rainy season' (and the 'high water season') is called [[rainy season|''invierno'']] or ''inverno'', though it could occur in the Northern Hemisphere summer; likewise, the 'dry season' (and 'low water season') is called [[dry season|''verano'']] or ''ver\u00e3o'', and can occur in the Northern Hemisphere winter).\n\n=== ''Am'': Tropical monsoon climate ===\n{{Main|Tropical monsoon climate}}\nThis type of climate results from the [[monsoon]] winds which change direction according to the seasons.

This flow is often what brings the frequent but short-lived summer thundershowers so typical of the more southerly subtropical  climates like the southern United States, southern China and Japan.<ref name=McKnight />{{rp|223\u20136}}\n\n'''Examples'''\n<div float=\"left\">\n{{col-begin|width=70%}}\n{{col-1-of-3}}\n* [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]] (''Cfa'')\n* [[Rosario]], Argentina (''Cfa'')\n* [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]] (''Cfa'')\n* [[Asunci\u00f3n]], [[Paraguay]] (''Cfa'', bordering on ''Aw'')\n* [[Florian\u00f3polis]], [[Brazil]] (''Cfa'')\n* [[Porto Alegre]], Brazil (''Cfa'')\n* [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], Brazil (''Cfa'')\n* [[Brisbane]], [[Australia]] (''Cfa'')\n* [[Sydney]], Australia (''Cfa'')\n* [[Bendigo]], Australia (''Cfa'')\n* [[Atlanta, Georgia]], United States (''Cfa'')\n* [[Dallas, Texas]], United States (''Cfa'')\n* [[Washington, D.C.]], United States (''Cfa'')\n* [[Astara, Azerbaijan|Astara]], [[Azerbaijan]] (''Cfa'')\n* [[Samsun]], [[Turkey]] (''Cfa'')\n* [[Belgrade, Serbia|Belgrade]], [[Serbia]] (''Cfa'')\n* [[Lugano]], [[Switzerland]] (''Cfa'', bordering on ''Cfb'')\n* [[Sochi]], [[Russia]] (''Cfa'')\n{{col-2-of-3}}\n* [[Krasnodar]], Russia (''Cfa'')\n* [[Tbilisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] (''Cfa'')\n* [[Tirana]], [[Albania]] (''Cfa'')\n* [[Milan]], [[Italy]] (''Cfa'')\n* [[Bologna]], Italy (''Cfa'')\n* [[Venice]], Italy (''Cfa'')\n* [[Lyon]], [[France]] (''Cfa, bordering on Cfb'')\n* [[Toulouse]], France (''Cfa'')\n* [[Srinagar]], [[India]] (''Cfa'')\n* [[Shanghai]], [[China]] (''Cfa'')\n* [[Chongqing]], China (''Cfa, bordering on Cwa'')\n* [[Guangzhou]], China (''Cfa'')\n* [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]] (''Cfa'')\n* [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]] (''Cfa'')\n* [[Osaka]], [[Japan]] (''Cfa'')\n* [[Rasht]], [[Iran]] (''Cfa'', bordering on ''Csa'')\n* [[Durban, South Africa|Durban]], [[South Africa]] (''Cfa'')\n{{col-end}}\n</div>\n\n=== ''Cfb'': Oceanic climate ===\n==== Marine west coast climate ====\n{{Main|Oceanic climate}}\n''Cfb'' climates usually occur in the higher middle latitudes on the western sides of continents between the latitudes of 40\u00b0 and 60\u00b0; they are typically situated immediately poleward of the Mediterranean climates, although in Australia and extreme southern Africa this climate is found immediately poleward of temperate climates, and at a somewhat lower latitude.

Decades of dumping toxic chemicals harmed the health of hundreds of residents<ref name=\":0\" />; the area was cleaned up over the course of 21 years in [[Superfund]] operation.\n\nIn 1890, Love Canal was created as a model [[planned community]], but was only partially developed. In the 1920s, the canal became a dump site for municipal refuse for the city of Niagara Falls. During the 1940s, the canal was purchased by [[Hooker Chemical Company]], now [[Occidental Chemical Corporation]], which used the site to dump 21,800 short tons of chemical byproducts from the manufacturing of dyes, perfumes, and solvents for rubber and synthetic resins.\n\nLove Canal was sold to the [[Niagara Falls City School District|local school district]] in 1953, after the threat of [[eminent domain]]. Over the next three decades, it attracted national attention for the public health problem originating from the former dumping of toxic waste on the grounds. This event displaced numerous families, leaving them with longstanding health issues and symptoms of high [[white blood cell]] counts and [[leukemia]]. Subsequently, the federal government passed the [[Superfund]] law. The resulting Superfund cleanup operation demolished the neighborhood, ending during 2004.\n\nIn 1988, [[New York State Department of Health]] Commissioner [[David Axelrod (physician)|David Axelrod]] called the Love Canal incident a \"national symbol of a failure to exercise a sense of concern for future generations\".<ref>{{cite web | first =  Sam How | last = Verhovek | title = After 10 Years, the Trauma of Love Canal Continues | work = The New York Times | date = August 5, 1988 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE6D9143CF936A3575BC0A96E948260 | accessdate = 2008-07-29}}</ref>  The Love Canal incident was especially significant as a situation where the inhabitants \"overflowed into the wastes instead of the other way around\".<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OFhfAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Road to Love Canal: Managing Industrial Waste before EPA|last=Colten|first=Craig E.|last2=Skinner|first2=Peter N.|publisher=[[University of Texas Press]]|year=1996|isbn=978-0292711839|location=Texas|page=153|access-date=2017-04-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170402091909/https://books.google.com/books?id=OFhfAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|archive-date=2017-04-02|url-status=live}}</ref> The [[University of Buffalo]] Archives house a number of primary documents, photographs, and news clippings pertaining to the Love Canal environmental disaster; many items have been digitized and are viewable online.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://library.buffalo.edu/specialcollections/lovecanal/|title=Love Canal Collections - University Archives - University at Buffalo Libraries|website=library.buffalo.edu|access-date=2018-02-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180206190152/https://library.buffalo.edu/specialcollections/lovecanal/|archive-date=2018-02-06|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\nLove Canal is a neighborhood located in the city of [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]] in the northwestern region of [[New York (state)|New York state]].

Love quickly arranged backing from financial banks in [[New York City]], Chicago, and England. During October 1893, the first factory opened for business. In May 1894, work on the canal had begun.

The deathblow came with the development of the transmission of electrical power over great distances by means of an alternating current. No longer was it necessary for the industry to locate near the source of electrical power.\n\nLove's financial backers deserted him, and the last piece of the properties owned by his corporation was subjected to mortgage foreclosure and sold at public auction in 1910.\n\nWith the project abandoned, the canal gradually filled with water.<ref name=\"Berton\" /> The local children swam there during summers and skated during the winters. In the 1920s, the canal became a [[dump site]] for the City of Niagara Falls, with the city regularly unloading its municipal refuse into the landfill.\n\nIndustry and tourism increased steadily throughout the first half of the 20th century due to a great demand for industrial products and the increased mobility of people to travel. Paper, rubber, plastics, petrochemicals, carbon insulators, and abrasives composed the city's major industries. This prosperity would end by the late 1960s as aging industrial plants were relocated to less expensive locations.\n\n==Love Canal disaster==\n=== Pre-disaster state of town ===\nAt the time of the dump's closure in 1952, Niagara Falls was experiencing prosperity, and the population had been expanding dramatically, growing by 31% in twenty years (1940-1960) from 78,020 to 102,394.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=us+census,+niagara+falls&spell=1&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjQ5P7ArMjUAhXH5oMKHbwtBNAQvwUIJSgA&biw=1366&bih=638|title=us census, niagara falls - Google Search|website=www.google.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-17}}</ref>\n\n=== Hooker Chemical Company ===\nBy the end of the 1940s, [[Hooker Chemical Company]] was searching for a place to dispose its large quantity of [[chemical waste]].

With a growing population, the [[Niagara Falls City School District]] needed land to build new schools and attempted to purchase the property from Hooker Chemical. The population reached more than 98,000 by the 1950 census.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/decennial/1950/population-volume-1/vol-01-35.pdf|title=Number of Inhabitants of New York|last=|first=|date=|website=Bureau of Census|access-date=March 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824122002/https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/decennial/1950/population-volume-1/vol-01-35.pdf|archive-date=August 24, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Sale of the site ===\nDuring March 1951, the school board prepared a plan showing a school being built over the canal and listing condemnation values for each property that would need to be acquired.<ref name=\"Zuesse-LoveCanal\">{{cite web | first = Eric | last = Zuesse | title = Love Canal: The Truth Seeps Out | publisher = Reason Magazine | date = February 1981 | URL = https://reason.com/archives/1981/02/01/love-canal/print | accessdate = 2017-10-31 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170127105829/http://reason.com/archives/1981/02/01/love-canal/print | archive-date = 2017-01-27 | url-status = live }}</ref> During March 1952, the superintendent of [[Niagara Falls City School District|Niagara Falls School Board]] inquired of Hooker with regard to purchasing the Love Canal property for the purpose of constructing a new school.

Murray, suggesting that the sale could alleviate them from future liabilities for the buried chemicals:\n\n{{quote|The more we thought about it, the more interested Wilcox and I became in the proposition, and finally came to the conclusion that the Love Canal property is rapidly becoming a liability because of housing projects in the near vicinity of our property. A school, however, could be built in the center unfilled section (with chemicals underground).

Hooker's letter to the board agreeing to enter into negotiations noted that \"in view of the nature of the property and the purposes for which it has been used, it will be necessary for us to have special provisions incorporated into the deed with respect to the use of the property and other pertinent matters.\" The board rejected the company's proposal that the deed require the land to be used for park purposes only, with the school itself to be built nearby.<ref name=\"Zuesse-LoveCanal\"/>\n\nAs \"a means of avoiding liability by relinquishing control of the site\", Hooker [[deed]]ed the site to the school board in 1953 for $1 with a liability limitation clause.{{sfn|Colten & Skinner|1996|p=161}} The sale document signed on April 28, 1953, included a seventeen-line [[Caveat emptor|caveat]] purporting to release the company from all legal obligations should lawsuits occur during the future.{{sfn|Colten & Skinner|1996|p=158}}{{sfn|Blum|2008|p=22}}<ref name=\"Zuesse-LoveCanal\"/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Michael H.|title=Love Canal and the Poisoning of America|journal=The Atlantic|date=December 1979|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1979/12/love-canal-and-the-poisoning-of-america/376297/|access-date=2017-03-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160715030152/http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1979/12/love-canal-and-the-poisoning-of-america/376297/|archive-date=2016-07-15|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Prior to the delivery of this instrument of conveyance, the grantee herein has been advised by the grantor that the premises above described have been filled, in whole or in part, to the present grade level thereof with waste products resulting from the manufacturing of chemicals by the grantor at its plant in the City of Niagara Falls, New York, and the grantee assumes all risk and liability incident to the use thereof.

Colton and Peter N. Skinner, \"Hooker assigned the board with a continuing duty to protect property buyers from chemicals when the company itself accepted no such 'moral obligation'.\"{{sfn|Colten & Skinner|1996|p=159}} The transfer effectively ended what provision of security and maintenance for the hazardous waste had existed before and placed all responsibility in clearly unqualified hands. It was this attempt to evade their responsibility, Colten and Skinner contend, that would \"ultimately come back to haunt not only Hooker but all other chemical producers in the United States through the strict liability provisions of Superfund legislation.\"{{sfn|Colten & Skinner|1996|p=157, 159, 161}} However, Eric Zeusse writes that Hooker's decision to sell the property rather than allowing the school board to condemn it stemmed from a desire to document its warnings. \"Had the land been condemned and seized, says Hooker, the company would have been unable to air its concerns to all future owners of the property. It is difficult to see any other reason for what it did.\"<ref name = \"Zuesse-LoveCanal\"/>\n\nNot long after having taken control of the land, the Niagara Falls School Board proceeded to develop the land, including construction activity that substantially breached containment structures in a number of ways, allowing previously trapped chemicals to seep out.\n\nThe resulting breaches combined with particularly heavy rainstorms released and spread the chemical waste, resulting in a [[public health]] emergency and an [[urban planning]] scandal. In what became a test case for liability clauses, Hooker Chemical was found to be \"negligent\" in their disposal of waste, though not reckless in the sale of the land. The dumpsite was discovered and investigated by the local newspaper, the ''[[Niagara Gazette|Niagara Falls Gazette]]'', from 1976 through the evacuation in 1978.\n\n[[File:Hooker Electrochemical Quit Claim Deed to Board of Education.pdf|thumb|Hooker Electrochemical Quit Claim Deed to Board of Education.]]\n\n===Construction of the 93rd Street School and the 99th Street School===\nDespite the disclaimer, the School Board began construction of the \"99th Street School\" in its originally intended location. In January 1954, the school's architect wrote to the education committee informing them that during excavation, workers discovered two dump sites filled with {{convert|55|USgal||adj=on}} drums containing chemical wastes. The architect also noted it would be \"poor policy\" to build in that area since it was not known what wastes were present in the ground, and the concrete [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]] might be damaged.<ref>Levine, p.12</ref> The school board then relocated the school site {{convert|80 to 85|ft||spell=in}} further north.{{sfn|Colten & Skinner|1996|p=153}} The kindergarten playground also had to be relocated because it was directly on top of a chemical dump.\n\nUpon completion in 1955, 400 children attended the school, and it opened along with several other schools that had been built to accommodate students. That same year, a twenty-five-foot area crumbled exposing toxic chemical drums, which then filled with water during rainstorms. This created large puddles that children enjoyed playing in.{{sfn|Colten & Skinner|1996|p=153}} In 1955, a second school, the 93rd Street School, was opened six blocks away.\n\n===Usage by the schools===\nDuring 1957, the City of Niagara Falls constructed sewers for a mixture of low-income and single family residences to be built on lands adjacent to the landfill site. The school district had sold the remaining land, resulting in homes constructed by private developers, as well as the Niagara Falls Housing Authority.

protest by Love Canal residents, ca. 1978.]]\nIn 1976, two reporters for the ''[[Niagara Gazette|Niagara Falls Gazette]]'', David Pollak and David Russell, tested several [[sump pump]]s near Love Canal and found toxic chemicals in them. The ''Gazette'' published reports, once in October 1976 and once in November 1976, of chemical analyses of residues near the old Love Canal dumpsite indicated presence of 15 organic chemicals, including three toxic chlorinated hydrocarbons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.buffalo.edu/specialcollections/lovecanal/about/chronology.php|title=Love Canal Chronologies - Love Canal Collections - University Archives - University at Buffalo Libraries|website=library.buffalo.edu|access-date=2017-02-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222185203/http://library.buffalo.edu/specialcollections/lovecanal/about/chronology.php|archive-date=2017-02-22|url-status=dead}}</ref> The matter became quiet for more than a year and was then revived by reporter Michael Brown, who then investigated potential health effects by performing an informal door-to-door survey during early 1978, writing a hundred news items on toxic wastes in the area and finding birth defects and many anomalies such as enlarged feet, heads, hands, and legs. He advised the local residents to create a protest group, which was organized by resident Karen Schroeder, whose daughter had many (about a dozen) birth defects. The New York State Health Department investigated and found an abnormal incidence of miscarriages. Brown discovered the size of the canal, the presence of dioxin, the expanding contamination, and the involvement, to an extent, of the U.S. Army. Hooker threatened to sue him and he fought the firm tooth and nail for years, including on the Today Show. His book on toxic wastes, Laying Waste: The Poisoning of America By Toxic Chemicals (Pantheon), was the first written on the subject of toxic wastes and created a national firestorm, as did articles of his in The New York Times Magazine and The Atlantic Monthly. He also discovered a massive dump called the Hyde Park landfill (or Bloody Run) and the \"S-Area,\" which was leaking into the water supply for Niagara Falls. His work inspired many activists. He spoke for ten years on the college lecture circuit.\n\nBy 1978, Love Canal had become a national media event with articles referring to the neighborhood as \"a public health time bomb\", and \"one of the most appalling environmental tragedies in American history\".<ref name=\"epa1\" />  Brown, working for the local newspaper, the ''Niagara Gazette'', is credited with not only revealing the case, but establishing toxic chemical wastes as a nationwide issue as well.  Brown's book, ''Laying Waste'', examined the Love Canal disaster and many other toxic waste catastrophes nationwide.<ref>Brown, Michael, ''Laying Waste:  The Poisoning of America by Toxic Chemicals.''  New York:  Washington Square Press, 1981, ii.</ref>\n\nThe dumpsite was declared an unprecedented state emergency on August 2, 1978. Brown, who wrote more than a hundred articles concerning the dump, tested the groundwater and later found the dump was three times larger than originally thought, with possible ramifications beyond the original evacuation zone. He was also to discover that toxic [[dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]] were there.\n\n=====Activism tactics=====\nActivism at Love Canal was initially organized by community residents Tom Heiser and [[Lois Gibbs]], with Lois Gibbs often serving as spokesperson.  Gibbs' strategies emphasized concerns for children and families of the affected area, with women taking the most prominent public and active roles{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}.  Many men also helped women in these efforts, though not always publicly{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}. Men who were hesitant to oppose Hooker Chemical openly for example, were able to contribute to the movement through increased contributions to family labor in the absence of their activist wives.<ref>''E. Blum, Love Canal Revisited: Race, Class, and Gender in Environmental Activism (2008)''</ref>\n\nIn addition to community organizing and pressuring authorities for appropriate responses, direct-action forms of activism were employed.  Tactics included protests and rallies, which were intentionally timed and planned in an effort to maximize media attention.  Such events included \"controversial\" methods such as mothers protesting while pushing strollers, marching by pregnant women, and children holding protest signs.  Notably, two EPA employees were also held hostage by activists for approximately five hours at the LCHA office, in order to bring their demands to the attention of the federal government.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publicintegrity.org/environment/from-homemaker-to-hell-raiser-in-love-canal/|title=From homemaker to hell-raiser in Love Canal|website=Center for Public Integrity|access-date=2019-02-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190224231550/https://publicintegrity.org/environment/from-homemaker-to-hell-raiser-in-love-canal/|archive-date=2019-02-24|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=====Role of community organizations=====\n{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2018}}\nNumerous organizations were formed in response to the crisis at Love Canal, with members' activism emphasizing variously overlapping interests.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kansaspress.ku.edu/978-0-7006-1820-0.html|title=Love Canal Revisited|website=kansaspress.ku.edu|access-date=2018-05-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180511081736/https://kansaspress.ku.edu/978-0-7006-1820-0.html|archive-date=2018-05-11|url-status=live}}</ref> In addition to the Love Canal Homeowners Association ([[Love Canal#Lois Gibbs and the Love Canal Homeowners' Association|LCHA]]), other major organizations are the Ecumenical Taskforce (ETF), National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and the Concerned Love Canal Renters Association (CLCRA). These organizations are often overlooked in the story of Love Canal, according to research by Elizabeth Blum in '[https://kansaspress.ku.edu/978-0-7006-1820-0.html 'Love Canal Revisited']'.\n\nThe Ecumenical Taskforce (ETF) was a religious organization composed of volunteers from the surrounding area. In conjunction with other citizens' groups such as LCHA and LCARA, the ETF used their resources to promote environmental health and gender, class, and racial equality. {{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nThe [[NAACP]] became involved with the Love Canal issue after William Abrams Sr., president of the Niagara Falls chapter drew concerns to his wife's fatal liver failure. Abrams involvement drew attention to racial inequality present in the community and concerns about how this could affect comprehensive relocation efforts. Abrams contacted the regional NAACP director who announced that discrimination against minorities at Love Canal would be met with legal action. This involvement inspired additional support and activism, particularly on behalf of members of the renting community, many of whom were also members of the African-American and immigrant communities at the site. {{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nAnother subgroup of local residents formed the Concerned Love Canal Renters Association (CLCRA). This group's action sought to address the needs of the (largely, but not exclusively, African-American) renter community, whose interests were at times perceived to be in conflict with those of some members of the (predominantly white) property owners represented by the LCHA. {{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nIn 1980 [[Lois Gibbs]] established the Center for Health, Environment, and Justice as a continuation of her activism at Love Canal. {{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n==== Lois Gibbs and the Love Canal Homeowners' Association ====\nOn August 2, 1978, [[Lois Gibbs]], a local mother who called an election to head the Love Canal Homeowners' Association, began to rally homeowners. Her son, Michael Gibbs, began attending school in September 1977. He developed [[epilepsy]] in December, suffered from [[asthma]] and a [[urinary tract infection]], and had a low [[white blood cell]] count,<ref name=\"gibbsheroproj\">{{cite web|url=http://www.heroism.org/class/1970/gibbs.html|title=Heroism Project - 1970s - Lois Gibbs|author=|date=|website=www.heroism.org|access-date=2007-07-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006195542/http://www.heroism.org/class/1970/gibbs.html|archive-date=2007-10-06|url-status=live}}</ref>{{sfn|Blum|2008|p=26}} all associated with his exposure to the leaking chemical waste. Gibbs had learned from Brown that her neighborhood sat atop the buried chemical waste.<ref name=\"goldman\">{{cite web|url=http://www.goldmanprize.org/node/103|title=Goldman Environmental Prize - Lois Gibbs|author=|date=|website=goldmanprize.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007023204/http://www.goldmanprize.org/node/103|archivedate=2007-10-07|df=}}</ref>\n\nDuring the following years, Gibbs organized an effort to investigate community concerns about the health of its residents. She and other residents made repeated complaints of strange odors and \"substances\" that surfaced in their yards. In Gibbs' neighborhood, there was a high rate of unexplained illnesses, miscarriages, and intellectual disability.{{sfn|Blum|2008|p=21}} Basements were often covered with a thick, black substance, and vegetation was dying.  In many yards, the only vegetation that grew were shrubby grasses.<ref>Levine, p.14</ref> Although city officials were asked to investigate the area, they did not act to solve the problem. Niagara Falls mayor Michael O'Laughlin infamously stated that there was \"nothing wrong\" in Love Canal.\n\nWith further investigation, Gibbs discovered the chemical danger of the adjacent canal. This began her organization's two-year effort to demonstrate that the waste buried by Hooker Chemical was responsible for the health problems of local residents. Throughout the ordeal, homeowners' concerns were ignored not only by Hooker Chemical (now a subsidiary of [[Occidental Petroleum]]), but also by members of government. These parties argued that the area's endemic health problems were unrelated to the toxic chemicals buried in the Canal. Since the residents could not prove the chemicals on their property had come from Hooker's disposal site, they could not prove [[legal liability|liability]]. Throughout the legal battle, residents were unable to sell their properties and relocate.\n\n==== Federal response ====\nOn August 7, 1978, United States President [[Jimmy Carter]] announced a federal health emergency, called for the allocation of federal funds, and ordered the Federal Disaster Assistance Agency to assist the City of Niagara Falls to remedy the Love Canal site.{{sfn|Blum|2008|p=28}} This was the first time in American history that emergency funds were used for a situation other than a natural disaster.<ref name=\"epa.gov\">{{cite news|last=Beck|first=Eckardt C.|title=The Love Canal Tragedy|work=EPA Journal|date=January 1979|url=http://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/history/topics/lovecanal/01.htm|accessdate=February 5, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408141141/http://www.epa.gov/history/topics/lovecanal/01.htm|archive-date=April 8, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>  Carter had trenches built that would transport the wastes to sewers and had home [[sump pump]]s sealed off.{{sfn|Blum|2008|p=28}}\n\n[[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), better known as the [[Superfund]] Act.

CERCLA also created a [[National Priorities List]], a shortened list of the sites that has priority in cleanup. Love Canal was the first Superfund site on that list. Eventually, the site was cleaned and deleted off the list in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/cursites/csitinfo.cfm?id=0201290|title=EPA Superfund Program: LOVE CANAL, NIAGARA FALLS, NY|last=|first=|date=|website=CERCLA|publisher=[[Environmental Protection Agency]]|access-date=18 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201085600/http://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/cursites/csitinfo.cfm?id=0201290|archive-date=1 February 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Because the Superfund Act contained a \"retroactive liability\" provision, Occidental was held liable for cleanup of the waste even though it had followed all applicable U.S. laws when disposing of it.\n\n==== Health effects ====\nAt first, scientific studies did not conclusively prove the chemicals were responsible for the residents' illnesses yet scientists were divided on the issue, even though eleven known or suspected [[carcinogens]] had been identified, one of the most prevalent being [[benzene]]. Also present was dioxin ([[polychlorinated dibenzodioxins]]) in the water, a very hazardous substance. Dioxin pollution is usually measured in [[parts per trillion]]; at Love Canal, water samples showed dioxin levels of 53 [[parts per billion]] (53,000 parts per trillion).{{sfn|Blum|2008|p=28}} [[Geologist]]s were recruited to determine whether underground [[Swale (geographical feature)|swales]] were responsible for carrying the chemicals to the surrounding residential areas. Once there, chemicals could [[soil contamination|leach]] into [[basement]]s and evaporate into [[Indoor air quality|household air]].\n\nIn 1979, the EPA announced the result of [[blood test]]s which showed high [[white blood cell]] counts, a precursor to [[leukemia]],<ref name=\"epa1\" /> and [[chromosome]] damage in Love Canal residents. 33% of the residents had undergone chromosomal damage. In a typical population, chromosomal damage affects 1% of people.{{sfn|Blum|2008|p=28}} Other studies were unable to find harm.<ref>''Cancer incidence in the Love Canal area.''

Thomas]] in 1985.]]\nWhen Eckhardt C. Beck (EPA Administrator for Region 2, 1977 \u2013 1979) visited Love Canal during the late 1970s, he discerned the presence of toxic substances in the community:\n\n{{quote|I visited the canal area at that time. Corroding waste-disposal drums could be seen breaking up through the grounds of backyards. Trees and gardens were turning black and dying. One entire swimming pool had been popped up from its foundation, afloat now on a small sea of chemicals. Puddles of noxious substances were pointed out to me by the residents. Some of these puddles were in their yards, some were in their basements, others yet were on the school grounds. Everywhere the air had a faint, choking smell. Children returned from play with burns on their hands and faces.<ref name=epa1 />}}\n\nRobert Whalen, then-New York's Health Commissioner, also visited Love Canal and believed that the Canal constituted an emergency, stating: \"Love Canal Chemical Waste Landfill constitutes a public nuisance and an extremely serious threat and danger to the health, safety and welfare of those using it, living near it or exposed to the conditions emanating from it, consisting among other things, of chemical wastes lying exposed on the surface in numerous places pervasive, pernicious and obnoxious chemical vapors and fumes affecting both the ambient air and the homes of certain residents living near such sites.\"{{sfn|Blum|2008|p=27}} Whalen also instructed people to avoid going into their basements as well as to avoid fruits and vegetables grown in their gardens.  People became very worried because many had consumed produce from their gardens for several years.<ref>Levine, p.29</ref> Whalen urged that all pregnant women and children under the age of two be removed from Love Canal as soon as possible.\n\nThe 99th Street School, on the other hand, was located within the former boundary of the Hooker Chemical landfill site. The school was closed and demolished, but both the school board and the chemical company refused to accept liability. The 93rd Street School was closed some two years later because of concerns about seeping toxic waste.\n\n==== Evacuation ====\nThe lack of public interest in Love Canal made matters worse for the homeowners' association, which was opposed by two organizations that sought to disprove negligence. Initially, members of the association had been frustrated by the lack of a public entity that could advise and defend them. Gibbs met with public resistance from a number of residents within the community. Eventually, the federal government relocated more than 800 families and reimbursed them for the loss of their homes. The state government and federal government used $15 million to purchase 400 homes closest to Love Canal and demolished several rings of houses. {{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n==== Litigation and compensation ====\nIn 1994, Federal District Judge [[John Thomas Curtin|John Curtin]] ruled that Hooker/Occidental had been [[Negligence|negligent]], but not reckless, in its handling of the waste and sale of the land to the [[Niagara Falls School Board]].<ref>U.S. v.

In the 1920s, the canal became a dump site for municipal refuse for the city of Niagara Falls. During the 1940s, the canal was purchased by [[Hooker Chemical Company]], now [[Occidental Chemical Corporation]], which used the site to dump 21,800 short tons of chemical byproducts from the manufacturing of dyes, perfumes, and solvents for rubber and synthetic resins.\n\nLove Canal was sold to the [[Niagara Falls City School District|local school district]] in 1953, after the threat of [[eminent domain]]. Over the next three decades, it attracted national attention for the public health problem originating from the former dumping of toxic waste on the grounds. This event displaced numerous families, leaving them with longstanding health issues and symptoms of high [[white blood cell]] counts and [[leukemia]]. Subsequently, the federal government passed the [[Superfund]] law. The resulting Superfund cleanup operation demolished the neighborhood, ending during 2004.\n\nIn 1988, [[New York State Department of Health]] Commissioner [[David Axelrod (physician)|David Axelrod]] called the Love Canal incident a \"national symbol of a failure to exercise a sense of concern for future generations\".<ref>{{cite web | first =  Sam How | last = Verhovek | title = After 10 Years, the Trauma of Love Canal Continues | work = The New York Times | date = August 5, 1988 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE6D9143CF936A3575BC0A96E948260 | accessdate = 2008-07-29}}</ref>  The Love Canal incident was especially significant as a situation where the inhabitants \"overflowed into the wastes instead of the other way around\".<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OFhfAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Road to Love Canal: Managing Industrial Waste before EPA|last=Colten|first=Craig E.|last2=Skinner|first2=Peter N.|publisher=[[University of Texas Press]]|year=1996|isbn=978-0292711839|location=Texas|page=153|access-date=2017-04-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170402091909/https://books.google.com/books?id=OFhfAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|archive-date=2017-04-02|url-status=live}}</ref> The [[University of Buffalo]] Archives house a number of primary documents, photographs, and news clippings pertaining to the Love Canal environmental disaster; many items have been digitized and are viewable online.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://library.buffalo.edu/specialcollections/lovecanal/|title=Love Canal Collections - University Archives - University at Buffalo Libraries|website=library.buffalo.edu|access-date=2018-02-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180206190152/https://library.buffalo.edu/specialcollections/lovecanal/|archive-date=2018-02-06|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\nLove Canal is a neighborhood located in the city of [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]] in the northwestern region of [[New York (state)|New York state]].

Love quickly arranged backing from financial banks in [[New York City]], Chicago, and England. During October 1893, the first factory opened for business. In May 1894, work on the canal had begun.

The deathblow came with the development of the transmission of electrical power over great distances by means of an alternating current. No longer was it necessary for the industry to locate near the source of electrical power.\n\nLove's financial backers deserted him, and the last piece of the properties owned by his corporation was subjected to mortgage foreclosure and sold at public auction in 1910.\n\nWith the project abandoned, the canal gradually filled with water.<ref name=\"Berton\" /> The local children swam there during summers and skated during the winters. In the 1920s, the canal became a [[dump site]] for the City of Niagara Falls, with the city regularly unloading its municipal refuse into the landfill.\n\nIndustry and tourism increased steadily throughout the first half of the 20th century due to a great demand for industrial products and the increased mobility of people to travel. Paper, rubber, plastics, petrochemicals, carbon insulators, and abrasives composed the city's major industries. This prosperity would end by the late 1960s as aging industrial plants were relocated to less expensive locations.\n\n==Love Canal disaster==\n=== Pre-disaster state of town ===\nAt the time of the dump's closure in 1952, Niagara Falls was experiencing prosperity, and the population had been expanding dramatically, growing by 31% in twenty years (1940-1960) from 78,020 to 102,394.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=us+census,+niagara+falls&spell=1&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjQ5P7ArMjUAhXH5oMKHbwtBNAQvwUIJSgA&biw=1366&bih=638|title=us census, niagara falls - Google Search|website=www.google.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-17}}</ref>\n\n=== Hooker Chemical Company ===\nBy the end of the 1940s, [[Hooker Chemical Company]] was searching for a place to dispose its large quantity of [[chemical waste]].

With a growing population, the [[Niagara Falls City School District]] needed land to build new schools and attempted to purchase the property from Hooker Chemical. The population reached more than 98,000 by the 1950 census.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/decennial/1950/population-volume-1/vol-01-35.pdf|title=Number of Inhabitants of New York|last=|first=|date=|website=Bureau of Census|access-date=March 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824122002/https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/decennial/1950/population-volume-1/vol-01-35.pdf|archive-date=August 24, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Sale of the site ===\nDuring March 1951, the school board prepared a plan showing a school being built over the canal and listing condemnation values for each property that would need to be acquired.<ref name=\"Zuesse-LoveCanal\">{{cite web | first = Eric | last = Zuesse | title = Love Canal: The Truth Seeps Out | publisher = Reason Magazine | date = February 1981 | URL = https://reason.com/archives/1981/02/01/love-canal/print | accessdate = 2017-10-31 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170127105829/http://reason.com/archives/1981/02/01/love-canal/print | archive-date = 2017-01-27 | url-status = live }}</ref> During March 1952, the superintendent of [[Niagara Falls City School District|Niagara Falls School Board]] inquired of Hooker with regard to purchasing the Love Canal property for the purpose of constructing a new school.

Murray, suggesting that the sale could alleviate them from future liabilities for the buried chemicals:\n\n{{quote|The more we thought about it, the more interested Wilcox and I became in the proposition, and finally came to the conclusion that the Love Canal property is rapidly becoming a liability because of housing projects in the near vicinity of our property. A school, however, could be built in the center unfilled section (with chemicals underground).

Hooker's letter to the board agreeing to enter into negotiations noted that \"in view of the nature of the property and the purposes for which it has been used, it will be necessary for us to have special provisions incorporated into the deed with respect to the use of the property and other pertinent matters.\" The board rejected the company's proposal that the deed require the land to be used for park purposes only, with the school itself to be built nearby.<ref name=\"Zuesse-LoveCanal\"/>\n\nAs \"a means of avoiding liability by relinquishing control of the site\", Hooker [[deed]]ed the site to the school board in 1953 for $1 with a liability limitation clause.{{sfn|Colten & Skinner|1996|p=161}} The sale document signed on April 28, 1953, included a seventeen-line [[Caveat emptor|caveat]] purporting to release the company from all legal obligations should lawsuits occur during the future.{{sfn|Colten & Skinner|1996|p=158}}{{sfn|Blum|2008|p=22}}<ref name=\"Zuesse-LoveCanal\"/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Michael H.|title=Love Canal and the Poisoning of America|journal=The Atlantic|date=December 1979|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1979/12/love-canal-and-the-poisoning-of-america/376297/|access-date=2017-03-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160715030152/http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1979/12/love-canal-and-the-poisoning-of-america/376297/|archive-date=2016-07-15|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Prior to the delivery of this instrument of conveyance, the grantee herein has been advised by the grantor that the premises above described have been filled, in whole or in part, to the present grade level thereof with waste products resulting from the manufacturing of chemicals by the grantor at its plant in the City of Niagara Falls, New York, and the grantee assumes all risk and liability incident to the use thereof.

Colton and Peter N. Skinner, \"Hooker assigned the board with a continuing duty to protect property buyers from chemicals when the company itself accepted no such 'moral obligation'.\"{{sfn|Colten & Skinner|1996|p=159}} The transfer effectively ended what provision of security and maintenance for the hazardous waste had existed before and placed all responsibility in clearly unqualified hands. It was this attempt to evade their responsibility, Colten and Skinner contend, that would \"ultimately come back to haunt not only Hooker but all other chemical producers in the United States through the strict liability provisions of Superfund legislation.\"{{sfn|Colten & Skinner|1996|p=157, 159, 161}} However, Eric Zeusse writes that Hooker's decision to sell the property rather than allowing the school board to condemn it stemmed from a desire to document its warnings. \"Had the land been condemned and seized, says Hooker, the company would have been unable to air its concerns to all future owners of the property. It is difficult to see any other reason for what it did.\"<ref name = \"Zuesse-LoveCanal\"/>\n\nNot long after having taken control of the land, the Niagara Falls School Board proceeded to develop the land, including construction activity that substantially breached containment structures in a number of ways, allowing previously trapped chemicals to seep out.\n\nThe resulting breaches combined with particularly heavy rainstorms released and spread the chemical waste, resulting in a [[public health]] emergency and an [[urban planning]] scandal. In what became a test case for liability clauses, Hooker Chemical was found to be \"negligent\" in their disposal of waste, though not reckless in the sale of the land. The dumpsite was discovered and investigated by the local newspaper, the ''[[Niagara Gazette|Niagara Falls Gazette]]'', from 1976 through the evacuation in 1978.\n\n[[File:Hooker Electrochemical Quit Claim Deed to Board of Education.pdf|thumb|Hooker Electrochemical Quit Claim Deed to Board of Education.]]\n\n===Construction of the 93rd Street School and the 99th Street School===\nDespite the disclaimer, the School Board began construction of the \"99th Street School\" in its originally intended location. In January 1954, the school's architect wrote to the education committee informing them that during excavation, workers discovered two dump sites filled with {{convert|55|USgal||adj=on}} drums containing chemical wastes. The architect also noted it would be \"poor policy\" to build in that area since it was not known what wastes were present in the ground, and the concrete [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]] might be damaged.<ref>Levine, p.12</ref> The school board then relocated the school site {{convert|80 to 85|ft||spell=in}} further north.{{sfn|Colten & Skinner|1996|p=153}} The kindergarten playground also had to be relocated because it was directly on top of a chemical dump.\n\nUpon completion in 1955, 400 children attended the school, and it opened along with several other schools that had been built to accommodate students. That same year, a twenty-five-foot area crumbled exposing toxic chemical drums, which then filled with water during rainstorms. This created large puddles that children enjoyed playing in.{{sfn|Colten & Skinner|1996|p=153}} In 1955, a second school, the 93rd Street School, was opened six blocks away.\n\n===Usage by the schools===\nDuring 1957, the City of Niagara Falls constructed sewers for a mixture of low-income and single family residences to be built on lands adjacent to the landfill site. The school district had sold the remaining land, resulting in homes constructed by private developers, as well as the Niagara Falls Housing Authority.

protest by Love Canal residents, ca. 1978.]]\nIn 1976, two reporters for the ''[[Niagara Gazette|Niagara Falls Gazette]]'', David Pollak and David Russell, tested several [[sump pump]]s near Love Canal and found toxic chemicals in them. The ''Gazette'' published reports, once in October 1976 and once in November 1976, of chemical analyses of residues near the old Love Canal dumpsite indicated presence of 15 organic chemicals, including three toxic chlorinated hydrocarbons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.buffalo.edu/specialcollections/lovecanal/about/chronology.php|title=Love Canal Chronologies - Love Canal Collections - University Archives - University at Buffalo Libraries|website=library.buffalo.edu|access-date=2017-02-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222185203/http://library.buffalo.edu/specialcollections/lovecanal/about/chronology.php|archive-date=2017-02-22|url-status=dead}}</ref> The matter became quiet for more than a year and was then revived by reporter Michael Brown, who then investigated potential health effects by performing an informal door-to-door survey during early 1978, writing a hundred news items on toxic wastes in the area and finding birth defects and many anomalies such as enlarged feet, heads, hands, and legs. He advised the local residents to create a protest group, which was organized by resident Karen Schroeder, whose daughter had many (about a dozen) birth defects. The New York State Health Department investigated and found an abnormal incidence of miscarriages. Brown discovered the size of the canal, the presence of dioxin, the expanding contamination, and the involvement, to an extent, of the U.S. Army. Hooker threatened to sue him and he fought the firm tooth and nail for years, including on the Today Show. His book on toxic wastes, Laying Waste: The Poisoning of America By Toxic Chemicals (Pantheon), was the first written on the subject of toxic wastes and created a national firestorm, as did articles of his in The New York Times Magazine and The Atlantic Monthly. He also discovered a massive dump called the Hyde Park landfill (or Bloody Run) and the \"S-Area,\" which was leaking into the water supply for Niagara Falls. His work inspired many activists. He spoke for ten years on the college lecture circuit.\n\nBy 1978, Love Canal had become a national media event with articles referring to the neighborhood as \"a public health time bomb\", and \"one of the most appalling environmental tragedies in American history\".<ref name=\"epa1\" />  Brown, working for the local newspaper, the ''Niagara Gazette'', is credited with not only revealing the case, but establishing toxic chemical wastes as a nationwide issue as well.  Brown's book, ''Laying Waste'', examined the Love Canal disaster and many other toxic waste catastrophes nationwide.<ref>Brown, Michael, ''Laying Waste:  The Poisoning of America by Toxic Chemicals.''  New York:  Washington Square Press, 1981, ii.</ref>\n\nThe dumpsite was declared an unprecedented state emergency on August 2, 1978. Brown, who wrote more than a hundred articles concerning the dump, tested the groundwater and later found the dump was three times larger than originally thought, with possible ramifications beyond the original evacuation zone. He was also to discover that toxic [[dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]] were there.\n\n=====Activism tactics=====\nActivism at Love Canal was initially organized by community residents Tom Heiser and [[Lois Gibbs]], with Lois Gibbs often serving as spokesperson.  Gibbs' strategies emphasized concerns for children and families of the affected area, with women taking the most prominent public and active roles{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}.  Many men also helped women in these efforts, though not always publicly{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}. Men who were hesitant to oppose Hooker Chemical openly for example, were able to contribute to the movement through increased contributions to family labor in the absence of their activist wives.<ref>''E. Blum, Love Canal Revisited: Race, Class, and Gender in Environmental Activism (2008)''</ref>\n\nIn addition to community organizing and pressuring authorities for appropriate responses, direct-action forms of activism were employed.  Tactics included protests and rallies, which were intentionally timed and planned in an effort to maximize media attention.  Such events included \"controversial\" methods such as mothers protesting while pushing strollers, marching by pregnant women, and children holding protest signs.  Notably, two EPA employees were also held hostage by activists for approximately five hours at the LCHA office, in order to bring their demands to the attention of the federal government.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publicintegrity.org/environment/from-homemaker-to-hell-raiser-in-love-canal/|title=From homemaker to hell-raiser in Love Canal|website=Center for Public Integrity|access-date=2019-02-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190224231550/https://publicintegrity.org/environment/from-homemaker-to-hell-raiser-in-love-canal/|archive-date=2019-02-24|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=====Role of community organizations=====\n{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2018}}\nNumerous organizations were formed in response to the crisis at Love Canal, with members' activism emphasizing variously overlapping interests.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kansaspress.ku.edu/978-0-7006-1820-0.html|title=Love Canal Revisited|website=kansaspress.ku.edu|access-date=2018-05-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180511081736/https://kansaspress.ku.edu/978-0-7006-1820-0.html|archive-date=2018-05-11|url-status=live}}</ref> In addition to the Love Canal Homeowners Association ([[Love Canal#Lois Gibbs and the Love Canal Homeowners' Association|LCHA]]), other major organizations are the Ecumenical Taskforce (ETF), National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and the Concerned Love Canal Renters Association (CLCRA). These organizations are often overlooked in the story of Love Canal, according to research by Elizabeth Blum in '[https://kansaspress.ku.edu/978-0-7006-1820-0.html 'Love Canal Revisited']'.\n\nThe Ecumenical Taskforce (ETF) was a religious organization composed of volunteers from the surrounding area. In conjunction with other citizens' groups such as LCHA and LCARA, the ETF used their resources to promote environmental health and gender, class, and racial equality. {{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nThe [[NAACP]] became involved with the Love Canal issue after William Abrams Sr., president of the Niagara Falls chapter drew concerns to his wife's fatal liver failure. Abrams involvement drew attention to racial inequality present in the community and concerns about how this could affect comprehensive relocation efforts. Abrams contacted the regional NAACP director who announced that discrimination against minorities at Love Canal would be met with legal action. This involvement inspired additional support and activism, particularly on behalf of members of the renting community, many of whom were also members of the African-American and immigrant communities at the site. {{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nAnother subgroup of local residents formed the Concerned Love Canal Renters Association (CLCRA). This group's action sought to address the needs of the (largely, but not exclusively, African-American) renter community, whose interests were at times perceived to be in conflict with those of some members of the (predominantly white) property owners represented by the LCHA. {{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nIn 1980 [[Lois Gibbs]] established the Center for Health, Environment, and Justice as a continuation of her activism at Love Canal. {{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n==== Lois Gibbs and the Love Canal Homeowners' Association ====\nOn August 2, 1978, [[Lois Gibbs]], a local mother who called an election to head the Love Canal Homeowners' Association, began to rally homeowners. Her son, Michael Gibbs, began attending school in September 1977. He developed [[epilepsy]] in December, suffered from [[asthma]] and a [[urinary tract infection]], and had a low [[white blood cell]] count,<ref name=\"gibbsheroproj\">{{cite web|url=http://www.heroism.org/class/1970/gibbs.html|title=Heroism Project - 1970s - Lois Gibbs|author=|date=|website=www.heroism.org|access-date=2007-07-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006195542/http://www.heroism.org/class/1970/gibbs.html|archive-date=2007-10-06|url-status=live}}</ref>{{sfn|Blum|2008|p=26}} all associated with his exposure to the leaking chemical waste. Gibbs had learned from Brown that her neighborhood sat atop the buried chemical waste.<ref name=\"goldman\">{{cite web|url=http://www.goldmanprize.org/node/103|title=Goldman Environmental Prize - Lois Gibbs|author=|date=|website=goldmanprize.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007023204/http://www.goldmanprize.org/node/103|archivedate=2007-10-07|df=}}</ref>\n\nDuring the following years, Gibbs organized an effort to investigate community concerns about the health of its residents. She and other residents made repeated complaints of strange odors and \"substances\" that surfaced in their yards. In Gibbs' neighborhood, there was a high rate of unexplained illnesses, miscarriages, and intellectual disability.{{sfn|Blum|2008|p=21}} Basements were often covered with a thick, black substance, and vegetation was dying.  In many yards, the only vegetation that grew were shrubby grasses.<ref>Levine, p.14</ref> Although city officials were asked to investigate the area, they did not act to solve the problem. Niagara Falls mayor Michael O'Laughlin infamously stated that there was \"nothing wrong\" in Love Canal.\n\nWith further investigation, Gibbs discovered the chemical danger of the adjacent canal. This began her organization's two-year effort to demonstrate that the waste buried by Hooker Chemical was responsible for the health problems of local residents. Throughout the ordeal, homeowners' concerns were ignored not only by Hooker Chemical (now a subsidiary of [[Occidental Petroleum]]), but also by members of government. These parties argued that the area's endemic health problems were unrelated to the toxic chemicals buried in the Canal. Since the residents could not prove the chemicals on their property had come from Hooker's disposal site, they could not prove [[legal liability|liability]]. Throughout the legal battle, residents were unable to sell their properties and relocate.\n\n==== Federal response ====\nOn August 7, 1978, United States President [[Jimmy Carter]] announced a federal health emergency, called for the allocation of federal funds, and ordered the Federal Disaster Assistance Agency to assist the City of Niagara Falls to remedy the Love Canal site.{{sfn|Blum|2008|p=28}} This was the first time in American history that emergency funds were used for a situation other than a natural disaster.<ref name=\"epa.gov\">{{cite news|last=Beck|first=Eckardt C.|title=The Love Canal Tragedy|work=EPA Journal|date=January 1979|url=http://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/history/topics/lovecanal/01.htm|accessdate=February 5, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408141141/http://www.epa.gov/history/topics/lovecanal/01.htm|archive-date=April 8, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>  Carter had trenches built that would transport the wastes to sewers and had home [[sump pump]]s sealed off.{{sfn|Blum|2008|p=28}}\n\n[[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), better known as the [[Superfund]] Act.

CERCLA also created a [[National Priorities List]], a shortened list of the sites that has priority in cleanup. Love Canal was the first Superfund site on that list. Eventually, the site was cleaned and deleted off the list in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/cursites/csitinfo.cfm?id=0201290|title=EPA Superfund Program: LOVE CANAL, NIAGARA FALLS, NY|last=|first=|date=|website=CERCLA|publisher=[[Environmental Protection Agency]]|access-date=18 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201085600/http://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/cursites/csitinfo.cfm?id=0201290|archive-date=1 February 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Because the Superfund Act contained a \"retroactive liability\" provision, Occidental was held liable for cleanup of the waste even though it had followed all applicable U.S. laws when disposing of it.\n\n==== Health effects ====\nAt first, scientific studies did not conclusively prove the chemicals were responsible for the residents' illnesses yet scientists were divided on the issue, even though eleven known or suspected [[carcinogens]] had been identified, one of the most prevalent being [[benzene]]. Also present was dioxin ([[polychlorinated dibenzodioxins]]) in the water, a very hazardous substance. Dioxin pollution is usually measured in [[parts per trillion]]; at Love Canal, water samples showed dioxin levels of 53 [[parts per billion]] (53,000 parts per trillion).{{sfn|Blum|2008|p=28}} [[Geologist]]s were recruited to determine whether underground [[Swale (geographical feature)|swales]] were responsible for carrying the chemicals to the surrounding residential areas. Once there, chemicals could [[soil contamination|leach]] into [[basement]]s and evaporate into [[Indoor air quality|household air]].\n\nIn 1979, the EPA announced the result of [[blood test]]s which showed high [[white blood cell]] counts, a precursor to [[leukemia]],<ref name=\"epa1\" /> and [[chromosome]] damage in Love Canal residents. 33% of the residents had undergone chromosomal damage. In a typical population, chromosomal damage affects 1% of people.{{sfn|Blum|2008|p=28}} Other studies were unable to find harm.<ref>''Cancer incidence in the Love Canal area.''

Thomas]] in 1985.]]\nWhen Eckhardt C. Beck (EPA Administrator for Region 2, 1977 \u2013 1979) visited Love Canal during the late 1970s, he discerned the presence of toxic substances in the community:\n\n{{quote|I visited the canal area at that time. Corroding waste-disposal drums could be seen breaking up through the grounds of backyards. Trees and gardens were turning black and dying. One entire swimming pool had been popped up from its foundation, afloat now on a small sea of chemicals. Puddles of noxious substances were pointed out to me by the residents. Some of these puddles were in their yards, some were in their basements, others yet were on the school grounds. Everywhere the air had a faint, choking smell. Children returned from play with burns on their hands and faces.<ref name=epa1 />}}\n\nRobert Whalen, then-New York's Health Commissioner, also visited Love Canal and believed that the Canal constituted an emergency, stating: \"Love Canal Chemical Waste Landfill constitutes a public nuisance and an extremely serious threat and danger to the health, safety and welfare of those using it, living near it or exposed to the conditions emanating from it, consisting among other things, of chemical wastes lying exposed on the surface in numerous places pervasive, pernicious and obnoxious chemical vapors and fumes affecting both the ambient air and the homes of certain residents living near such sites.\"{{sfn|Blum|2008|p=27}} Whalen also instructed people to avoid going into their basements as well as to avoid fruits and vegetables grown in their gardens.  People became very worried because many had consumed produce from their gardens for several years.<ref>Levine, p.29</ref> Whalen urged that all pregnant women and children under the age of two be removed from Love Canal as soon as possible.\n\nThe 99th Street School, on the other hand, was located within the former boundary of the Hooker Chemical landfill site. The school was closed and demolished, but both the school board and the chemical company refused to accept liability. The 93rd Street School was closed some two years later because of concerns about seeping toxic waste.\n\n==== Evacuation ====\nThe lack of public interest in Love Canal made matters worse for the homeowners' association, which was opposed by two organizations that sought to disprove negligence. Initially, members of the association had been frustrated by the lack of a public entity that could advise and defend them. Gibbs met with public resistance from a number of residents within the community. Eventually, the federal government relocated more than 800 families and reimbursed them for the loss of their homes. The state government and federal government used $15 million to purchase 400 homes closest to Love Canal and demolished several rings of houses. {{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n==== Litigation and compensation ====\nIn 1994, Federal District Judge [[John Thomas Curtin|John Curtin]] ruled that Hooker/Occidental had been [[Negligence|negligent]], but not reckless, in its handling of the waste and sale of the land to the [[Niagara Falls School Board]].<ref>U.S. v.

All that remains on the west side are abandoned residential streets. Some older east side residents, whose houses stand alone in the demolished neighborhood, chose to stay. It was estimated that fewer than 90 of the original 900 families opted to remain.{{sfn|Blum|2008|p=28}} They were willing to remain as long as they were guaranteed that their homes were in a relatively safe area.<ref name=\"Levine, p.215\">Levine, p. 215</ref> On June 4, 1980, the [[Government of New York|state government]] founded the Love Canal Area Revitalization Agency (LCARA) to restore the area.

LCARA wanted to resell 300 homes that had been bought by New York when the residents were relocated.<ref name=\"Levine, p.215\"/>  The homes are farther away from where the chemicals were dumped. The most toxic area ({{convert|16|acre|m2}}) was reburied with a thick plastic liner, clay and dirt.

Love Canal \"become the symbol for what happens when hazardous industrial products are not confined to the workplace but 'hit people where they live' in inestimable amounts\".<ref>Levine, p.218</ref>\n\nLove Canal was not an isolated case. Eckardt C. Beck suggested that there are probably hundreds of similar dumpsites.<ref name=\"epa.gov\"/> President Carter declared that discovering these dumpsites was \"one of the grimmest discoveries of the modern era\".<ref name=\"epa.gov\"/> Had the residents of Love Canal been aware that they were residing on toxic chemicals, most would not have moved there in the first place. Beck noted that one main problem remains that ownership of such chemical companies can change over the years, making liability difficult to assign (a problem that would be addressed by CERCLA, or the Superfund Act).<ref name=\"epa.gov\"/>  Beck contended that increased commitment was necessary to develop controls that would \"defuse future Love Canals\".<ref name=\"epa.gov\"/>\n\nThe [[free market environmentalist]] activists have often cited the Love Canal incident as a consequence of government decision-makers not taking responsibility for their decisions. Stroup writes, \"The school district owning the land had a laudable but narrow goal: it wanted to provide education cheaply for district children. Government decision makers are seldom held accountable for broader social goals in the way that private owners are by liability rules and potential profits.\"<ref name=Stroup>{{citation|url=http://www.nesgeorgia.org/files/free_market_environmentalism.pdf|author=Stroup, Richard|title=Free-Market Environmentalism|publisher=The Library of Economics and Liberty|access-date=2010-08-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405015942/http://www.nesgeorgia.org/files/free_market_environmentalism.pdf|archive-date=2016-04-05|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Conclusion===\nIn 2004, federal officials announced that the Superfund cleanup has ended, albeit cleanup had concluded years prior.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TPwhvm4DfdwC&pg=PT182&lpg=PT182&dq=2004+love+canal#v=onepage&q=2004%20love%20canal&f=false|title=Love Canal|last=JD|first=Penelope Ploughman PhD|date=2013-03-25|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=9781439641996|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2GURDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT297&lpg=PT297&dq=2004+love+canal#v=onepage&q=2004%20love%20canal&f=false|title=Love Canal: A Toxic History from Colonial Times to the Present|last=Newman|first=Richard S.|date=2016-04-12|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780190262846|language=en}}</ref> The entire process occurred over 21 years and costed a total of $400 million.<ref name=\"Depalma\"/> About 260 homes north of the canal have been renovated and sold to new owners, and about {{convert|150|acre|}} east of the canal have been sold to commercial developers for light industrial uses.

Residents of [[North Tonawanda]] and Wheatfield suffering severe health problems say the waste was subsequently disturbed during the construction of the LaSalle Expressway in Niagara Falls. The New York Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) contends there is no proof the landfill leaks. A lawsuit asserts that Hooker's creation of a brine pipeline along the edge of the landfill used to move brine from Wyoming County to its Niagara Falls plant location, may have created a conduit for the landfilled waste to leak out.<ref>[http://buffalonews.com/2017/04/03/draft-landfill-lawsuit/ Residents feel 'trapped' by Wheatfield landfill, once home to Love Canal waste] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822120106/http://buffalonews.com/2017/04/03/draft-landfill-lawsuit/ |date=2017-08-22 }} by Thomas J.

One of the highest-paid actresses in India, [[List of awards and nominations received by Deepika Padukone|her accolades]] include three [[Filmfare Awards]]. She features in listings of the nation's most popular personalities, and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' named her one of the [[Time 100|100 most influential people in the world]] in 2018.\n\nPadukone, the daughter of the badminton player [[Prakash Padukone]], was born in [[Copenhagen]] and raised in [[Bangalore]]. As a teenager, she played badminton in national level championships but left her career in the sport to become a fashion model. She soon received offers for film roles and made her acting debut in 2006 as the title character of the [[Kannada film]] ''[[Aishwarya (film)|Aishwarya]]''.

On issue #1's masthead, Clowes described the anthology as \"An Orgy of Spite, Vengeance, Hopelessness, Despair, and Sexual Perversiona\". ''Eightball'' lasted twenty three issues, ending in 2004. One of the most widely acclaimed American alternative comics, it won over two dozen awards, and all of Clowes's ''Eightball'' serials have been collected and released as graphic novels.\n\nFrom #1 to #18, an ''Eightball'' issue typically contained short pieces that ranged in genre from comical rant and Freudian analysis to fairy tale and cultural criticism. These issues also featured a chapter of a serial that Clowes later collected as a graphic novel: ''[[Like a Velvet Glove Cast in Iron]]'' (1993), ''[[Pussey!]]'' (1995), and ''[[Ghost World (comics)|Ghost World]]'' (1997). With #19, Clowes abandoned the anthology format. The oversized black and white issues #19\u201321 each contained a single act of Clowes's three-act ''[[David Boring]]'', which was released as a graphic novel in 2000. Clowes again changed format with #22. The first full-color ''Eightball'', #22 included a single graphic novel-length story ''Ice Haven.'' The final issue, #23 was a full-color, single-story comic ''The Death-Ray'' released in 2004.\n\nDuring the early 1990s, Clowes was associated with Seattle label [[Sub Pop]], creating artwork for recordings by Thee HeadCoats, The Supersuckers, The John Peel Sessions, and The Sub Pop Video Program collection. He designed the label's mascot, Punky, who appeared on T-shirts, paddle-balls, watches, and other merchandise. In 1994, Clowes created art for the [[Ramones]] video \"I Don't Want to Grow Up\".\n\n==Post-''Eightball,'' 2005\u20132016==\nAfter ''Eightball'' ended in 2004, Clowes began to release full-color graphic novels, beginning in 2005 with ''Ice Haven,'' a revised version of the comic that appeared in ''Eightball'' #22. In 2010 Drawn and Quarterly published ''Wilson,'' Clowes's first graphic novel that had not been serialized in ''Eightball.'' The next year, Pantheon released ''Mister Wonderful,'' a revised and reformatted version of a narrative serialized weekly in 2007 and 2008 in ''[[The New York Times Magazine|The Sunday New York Times Magazine]]'', a story Clowes described as a \"romance.\"<ref>[http://www.comicbookbin.com/fantagraphicsbooks030.html \"New Daniel Clowes Comic Strip Launches Sunday in NY Times\"], The Comic Book Bin, 2007-09-13.  Retrieved on 2007-09-15.</ref> 2011 also saw the Drawn and Quarterly hardcover release of ''The Death-Ray'', which first appeared in ''Eightball'' #23.\n\nDuring this period, Clowes drew the first of several ''New Yorker'' covers and contributed comics to Zadie Smith's ''The Book of Other People'' (2008) and the influential art comics anthology ''Kramers Ergot'' (#7, 2008). In 2006, after a health crisis,<ref>[http://www.avclub.com/articles/the-best-comics-of-the-00s,35713/ \"The best comics of the \u201900s\", The Onion A.V.

Clowes lives in [[Oakland, California]], with his wife Erika and son Charlie.<ref>''The Comics Journal'' ({{ISBN|978-1-56097-984-5}}), issue 294, Dec. 2008, page 102: In a one-page strip, sent to the magazine as a holiday card, Clowes has his son, Charlie, \"looking back at 2006 AD.\" \"Charlie Clowes\" says \"2006 was quite a year...

Club]], 2008-01-03.]</ref>\n\n==Cultural contexts==\nClowes's work emerged from the late-1980 and early-\u201990s North American alternative comics scene and played an important role in comics achieving a new level of respect from reviewers, academics, and readers. ''Ghost World'' was among the earliest American \"literary\" comics to be marketed and sold through conventional book stores as a [[graphic novel]]<ref>''The Daniel Clowes Reader,'' Fantagraphics, 2013, page 23.</ref> (Clowes has been critical of the terms \"literary comics\" and \"graphic novel.\")<ref>''The Daniel Clowes Reader,'' Fantagraphics, 2013, page 22 and 10.</ref>\n\nSome of his most popular stories, such as ''Ghost World'' and \"The Party\", are associated with [[Generation X]] (\"The Party\" was reprinted in Douglas Rushkoff's 1994 ''GenX Reader''). This movement's investment in post-adolescent aimlessness was one of Clowes's main themes during the 1990s. The cartoonist led the way for comic artists like [[Adrian Tomine]] and [[Craig Thompson]], who also focused on the angst of post-adolescent characters.\n\nLike filmmaker [[David Lynch]], Clowes is known for mixing elements of [[kitsch]] and the [[grotesque]].<ref>''David Lynch: Interviews,'' University Press of Mississippi, 2009, page 22.</ref> Reflecting the cartoonist's interest in 1950s and 1960s TV, film, mainstream and [[underground comics]], and ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine, these elements surface in Clowes's 1990s work, especially his graphic novel ''[[Like a Velvet Glove Cast in Iron]].'' During the 1990s, the juxtaposition of kitsch and horror became something of a zeitgeist in visual art, independent film, and post-underground comics.\n\nClowes's post-2000 graphic novels marked a shift in subject matter and form. ''Ice Haven'', ''The Death-Ray'', ''Wilson'', and ''Mister Wonderful'' featured older protagonists and explored issues of masculinity and aging. Like the work of fellow cartoonists [[Chris Ware]] and [[Art Spiegelman]], these comics displayed an interest in American comic-strip history, using layouts, coloring, and drawing styles reminiscent of newspaper cartoons, especially the large early- and mid-twentieth-century Sunday comic strips.<ref>''The Daniel Clowes Reader,'' Fantagraphics, 2013, page 335.</ref>\n\n==Awards==\nClowes has received dozens of awards and nominations for his comics and film work. In 2002 he was nominated for several awards for the ''Ghost World'' film, including an Academy Award for Best Screenplay Based on Material Previously Published, an AFI Award for Screenwriter of the Year, a Chicago Film Critics Association Awards for Best Screenplay, and others.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0162346/awards]</ref>\n  \nFor his comics, Clowes has won many [[Harvey Award]]s, including Best Writer in 1997 and 2005; Best Series in 1990, 1991, 1992, and 1997; Best Letter in 1991 and 1997; Best Single Issue or Story in 1990, 1991, 1998 and 2005; and Best Cartoonist in 2002. He has won numerous [[Eisner Awards]], including Best Writer/Artist: Drama in 2000 and 2002; Best Single Issue/Single Story in 2002 and 2005; Best Short Story in 2008; Best New Graphic Album in 2011. In 2011, he won a Pen Award for Outstanding Body of Work in Graphic Literature.<ref>[http://penusa.org/2011-literary-awards-festival-winners 2011 PEN Literary Awards Festival Winners] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140613225648/http://penusa.org/2011-literary-awards-festival-winners |date=2014-06-13 }}</ref>\n\n==Exhibitions==\nClowes's original art has appeared in American group shows as well as exhibitions in Belgium, France, Germany, Japan, and elsewhere. His first solo show was held at Los Angeles's Richard Heller Gallery in 2003. In 2012, Susan Miller curated his first museum retrospective, ''Modern Cartoonist: The Art of Daniel Clowes'' at the [[Oakland Museum of California]]. It featured 100 works, including pencil and ink drawings, color pencil illustrations, and gouache art, with covers for ''The New Yorker,'' ''Eightball'' issues, and Clowes's graphic novels. The show traveled to the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago]] in 2013, and is at the [[Wexner Center]] in Columbus, Ohio, in mid-2014. It may continue on to Europe and Asia.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/01/arts/design/daniel-clowess-retrospective-at-the-oakland-museum.html Kino, Carol. \"Humanity's Discomfort, Punctured With a Pen\".

Based on Clowes's comic of the same name and written with director [[Terry Zwigoff]], the film is set in a nondescript American town and follows the misadventures of two best friends, Enid ([[Thora Birch]]) and Rebecca ([[Scarlett Johansson]]), who detest most of their high school classmates. After graduation they plan on moving in together and avoiding college, but they grow apart as adult pressures take their toll. The girls play a prank on a nerdy record collector named Seymour ([[Steve Buscemi]]), who quickly becomes Enid's unlikely friend and confidante, as her relationship with Rebecca deteriorates. Nominated for a host of awards, most notably a 2002 [[Academy Award]] for Best Adapted Screenplay, the movie appeared on many 2001 \"Best of\" lists.<ref>[https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1804856723/awards Ghost World (2001) \u2013 Awards and Nominations \u2013 Yahoo!

(Clowes's four-page comic \"[[Art School Confidential (comics)|Art School Confidential]]\" covered some of the same experiences.) Directed by Zwigoff with a script by Clowes, the film follows Jerome ([[Max Minghella]]), an art student who dreams of becoming the world's greatest artist. The film was not as well received as ''Ghost World''.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364955/</ref> In 2006, Fantagraphics published ''Art School Confidential: A Screenplay''.

Most of Clowes's work first appeared in ''[[Eightball (comic book)|Eightball]]'', a solo anthology comic book series. An ''Eightball'' issue typically contained several short pieces and a chapter of a longer narrative that was later collected and published as a graphic novel, such as ''[[Like a Velvet Glove Cast in Iron]]'' (1993), ''[[Ghost World (comics)|Ghost World]]'' (1997), and ''[[David Boring]]'' (2000). Clowes's illustrations have appeared in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[Newsweek]]'', ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', ''[[The Village Voice]]'', and elsewhere. With filmmaker [[Terry Zwigoff]], Clowes adapted ''Ghost World'' into [[Ghost World (film)|a 2001 film]] and another ''Eightball'' story into the 2006 film, ''[[Art School Confidential (film)|Art School Confidential]]''. Clowes's comics, graphic novels, and films have received numerous awards, including a Pen Award for Outstanding Work in Graphic Literature, over a dozen [[Harvey Award|Harvey]] and [[Eisner Awards]], and an Academy Award nomination.\n\n==Early life and career, 1961\u20131988==\n\nClowes was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], to an auto mechanic mother and a furniture craftsman father.<ref>[http://www.diablomag.com/Diablo-Magazine/April-2012/Meet-Daniel-Clowes/ Meet: Daniel Clowes \u2013 Diablo Magazine \u2013 April 2012 \u2013 East Bay \u2013 California].

Clowes and writer Mort Todd co-created a recurring ''Cracked'' feature titled ''The Uggly Family''. In 1985, Clowes drew the first comic to feature his character [[Lloyd Llewellyn]]. He sent the story to [[Fantagraphics]]' [[Gary Groth]], and his work soon appeared in the [[Hernandez brothers]]' ''[[Love and Rockets (comics)|Love and Rockets]]'' #13. Fantagraphics published six magazine-sized, black and white issues of ''Lloyd Llewellyn'' in 1986 and 1987, and ''The All-New Lloyd Llewellyn'', the final Llewellyn comic book, appeared in 1988.\n\n==''Eightball'', 1989\u20132004==\nIn 1989, Fantagraphics published the first issue of Clowes's comic book ''[[Eightball (comic book)|Eightball]].'' On issue #1's masthead, Clowes described the anthology as \"An Orgy of Spite, Vengeance, Hopelessness, Despair, and Sexual Perversiona\". ''Eightball'' lasted twenty three issues, ending in 2004. One of the most widely acclaimed American alternative comics, it won over two dozen awards, and all of Clowes's ''Eightball'' serials have been collected and released as graphic novels.\n\nFrom #1 to #18, an ''Eightball'' issue typically contained short pieces that ranged in genre from comical rant and Freudian analysis to fairy tale and cultural criticism. These issues also featured a chapter of a serial that Clowes later collected as a graphic novel: ''[[Like a Velvet Glove Cast in Iron]]'' (1993), ''[[Pussey!]]'' (1995), and ''[[Ghost World (comics)|Ghost World]]'' (1997). With #19, Clowes abandoned the anthology format. The oversized black and white issues #19\u201321 each contained a single act of Clowes's three-act ''[[David Boring]]'', which was released as a graphic novel in 2000. Clowes again changed format with #22. The first full-color ''Eightball'', #22 included a single graphic novel-length story ''Ice Haven.'' The final issue, #23 was a full-color, single-story comic ''The Death-Ray'' released in 2004.\n\nDuring the early 1990s, Clowes was associated with Seattle label [[Sub Pop]], creating artwork for recordings by Thee HeadCoats, The Supersuckers, The John Peel Sessions, and The Sub Pop Video Program collection. He designed the label's mascot, Punky, who appeared on T-shirts, paddle-balls, watches, and other merchandise. In 1994, Clowes created art for the [[Ramones]] video \"I Don't Want to Grow Up\".\n\n==Post-''Eightball,'' 2005\u20132016==\nAfter ''Eightball'' ended in 2004, Clowes began to release full-color graphic novels, beginning in 2005 with ''Ice Haven,'' a revised version of the comic that appeared in ''Eightball'' #22. In 2010 Drawn and Quarterly published ''Wilson,'' Clowes's first graphic novel that had not been serialized in ''Eightball.'' The next year, Pantheon released ''Mister Wonderful,'' a revised and reformatted version of a narrative serialized weekly in 2007 and 2008 in ''[[The New York Times Magazine|The Sunday New York Times Magazine]]'', a story Clowes described as a \"romance.\"<ref>[http://www.comicbookbin.com/fantagraphicsbooks030.html \"New Daniel Clowes Comic Strip Launches Sunday in NY Times\"], The Comic Book Bin, 2007-09-13.

Club]], 2008-01-03.]</ref>\n\n==Cultural contexts==\nClowes's work emerged from the late-1980 and early-\u201990s North American alternative comics scene and played an important role in comics achieving a new level of respect from reviewers, academics, and readers. ''Ghost World'' was among the earliest American \"literary\" comics to be marketed and sold through conventional book stores as a [[graphic novel]]<ref>''The Daniel Clowes Reader,'' Fantagraphics, 2013, page 23.</ref> (Clowes has been critical of the terms \"literary comics\" and \"graphic novel.\")<ref>''The Daniel Clowes Reader,'' Fantagraphics, 2013, page 22 and 10.</ref>\n\nSome of his most popular stories, such as ''Ghost World'' and \"The Party\", are associated with [[Generation X]] (\"The Party\" was reprinted in Douglas Rushkoff's 1994 ''GenX Reader''). This movement's investment in post-adolescent aimlessness was one of Clowes's main themes during the 1990s. The cartoonist led the way for comic artists like [[Adrian Tomine]] and [[Craig Thompson]], who also focused on the angst of post-adolescent characters.\n\nLike filmmaker [[David Lynch]], Clowes is known for mixing elements of [[kitsch]] and the [[grotesque]].<ref>''David Lynch: Interviews,'' University Press of Mississippi, 2009, page 22.</ref> Reflecting the cartoonist's interest in 1950s and 1960s TV, film, mainstream and [[underground comics]], and ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine, these elements surface in Clowes's 1990s work, especially his graphic novel ''[[Like a Velvet Glove Cast in Iron]].'' During the 1990s, the juxtaposition of kitsch and horror became something of a zeitgeist in visual art, independent film, and post-underground comics.\n\nClowes's post-2000 graphic novels marked a shift in subject matter and form. ''Ice Haven'', ''The Death-Ray'', ''Wilson'', and ''Mister Wonderful'' featured older protagonists and explored issues of masculinity and aging. Like the work of fellow cartoonists [[Chris Ware]] and [[Art Spiegelman]], these comics displayed an interest in American comic-strip history, using layouts, coloring, and drawing styles reminiscent of newspaper cartoons, especially the large early- and mid-twentieth-century Sunday comic strips.<ref>''The Daniel Clowes Reader,'' Fantagraphics, 2013, page 335.</ref>\n\n==Awards==\nClowes has received dozens of awards and nominations for his comics and film work. In 2002 he was nominated for several awards for the ''Ghost World'' film, including an Academy Award for Best Screenplay Based on Material Previously Published, an AFI Award for Screenwriter of the Year, a Chicago Film Critics Association Awards for Best Screenplay, and others.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0162346/awards]</ref>\n  \nFor his comics, Clowes has won many [[Harvey Award]]s, including Best Writer in 1997 and 2005; Best Series in 1990, 1991, 1992, and 1997; Best Letter in 1991 and 1997; Best Single Issue or Story in 1990, 1991, 1998 and 2005; and Best Cartoonist in 2002. He has won numerous [[Eisner Awards]], including Best Writer/Artist: Drama in 2000 and 2002; Best Single Issue/Single Story in 2002 and 2005; Best Short Story in 2008; Best New Graphic Album in 2011. In 2011, he won a Pen Award for Outstanding Body of Work in Graphic Literature.<ref>[http://penusa.org/2011-literary-awards-festival-winners 2011 PEN Literary Awards Festival Winners] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140613225648/http://penusa.org/2011-literary-awards-festival-winners |date=2014-06-13 }}</ref>\n\n==Exhibitions==\nClowes's original art has appeared in American group shows as well as exhibitions in Belgium, France, Germany, Japan, and elsewhere. His first solo show was held at Los Angeles's Richard Heller Gallery in 2003. In 2012, Susan Miller curated his first museum retrospective, ''Modern Cartoonist: The Art of Daniel Clowes'' at the [[Oakland Museum of California]]. It featured 100 works, including pencil and ink drawings, color pencil illustrations, and gouache art, with covers for ''The New Yorker,'' ''Eightball'' issues, and Clowes's graphic novels. The show traveled to the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago]] in 2013, and is at the [[Wexner Center]] in Columbus, Ohio, in mid-2014. It may continue on to Europe and Asia.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/01/arts/design/daniel-clowess-retrospective-at-the-oakland-museum.html Kino, Carol. \"Humanity's Discomfort, Punctured With a Pen\".

Based on Clowes's comic of the same name and written with director [[Terry Zwigoff]], the film is set in a nondescript American town and follows the misadventures of two best friends, Enid ([[Thora Birch]]) and Rebecca ([[Scarlett Johansson]]), who detest most of their high school classmates. After graduation they plan on moving in together and avoiding college, but they grow apart as adult pressures take their toll. The girls play a prank on a nerdy record collector named Seymour ([[Steve Buscemi]]), who quickly becomes Enid's unlikely friend and confidante, as her relationship with Rebecca deteriorates. Nominated for a host of awards, most notably a 2002 [[Academy Award]] for Best Adapted Screenplay, the movie appeared on many 2001 \"Best of\" lists.<ref>[https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1804856723/awards Ghost World (2001) \u2013 Awards and Nominations \u2013 Yahoo!

(Clowes's four-page comic \"[[Art School Confidential (comics)|Art School Confidential]]\" covered some of the same experiences.) Directed by Zwigoff with a script by Clowes, the film follows Jerome ([[Max Minghella]]), an art student who dreams of becoming the world's greatest artist. The film was not as well received as ''Ghost World''.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364955/</ref> In 2006, Fantagraphics published ''Art School Confidential: A Screenplay''.

Blanche is in her thirties and, with no money, has nowhere else to go.\n\nBlanche tells Stella that she has taken a leave of absence from her English-teaching position because of her nerves (which is later revealed to be a lie). Blanche laments the shabbiness of her sister's two-room flat. She finds Stanley loud and rough, eventually referring to him as \"common\". Stanley, in return, does not care for Blanche's manners and dislikes her presence.\n\nStanley later questions Blanche about her earlier marriage. Blanche had married when she was very young, but her husband died, leaving her widowed and alone. The memory of her dead husband causes Blanche some obvious distress. Stanley, worried that he has been cheated out of an inheritance, demands to know what happened to Belle Reve, once a large plantation and the DuBois family home. Blanche hands over all the documents pertaining to Belle Reve. While looking at the papers, Stanley notices a bundle of letters that Blanche emotionally proclaims are personal love letters from her dead husband. For a moment, Stanley seems caught off guard over her proclaimed feelings. Afterwards, he informs Blanche that Stella is going to have a baby. This can be seen as the start of Blanche's mental upheaval.\n\nThe night after Blanche's arrival, during one of Stanley's poker games, Blanche meets Mitch, one of Stanley's poker player buddies. His courteous manner sets him apart from the other men. Their chat becomes flirtatious and friendly, and Blanche easily charms him; they like each other. Suddenly becoming upset over multiple interruptions, Stanley explodes in a drunken rage and strikes Stella. Blanche and Stella take refuge with the upstairs neighbor, Eunice. When Stanley recovers, he cries out from the courtyard below for Stella to come back by repeatedly calling her name until she comes down and allows herself to be carried off to bed. After Stella returns to Stanley, Blanche and Mitch sit at the bottom of the steps in the courtyard, where Mitch apologizes for Stanley's coarse behavior.\n\nBlanche is bewildered that Stella would go back to her abusive husband after such violence. The next morning, Blanche rushes to Stella and describes Stanley as a subhuman animal, though Stella assures Blanche that she and Stanley are fine. Stanley overhears the conversation but keeps silent. When Stanley comes in, Stella hugs and kisses him, letting Blanche know that her low opinion of Stanley does not matter.\n\nAs the weeks pass, the friction between Blanche and Stanley continues to grow. Blanche has hope in Mitch, and tells Stella that she wants to go away with him and not be anyone's problem. During a meeting between the two, Blanche confesses to Mitch that once she was married to a young man, Allan Grey, whom she later discovered in a sexual encounter with an older man. Grey later committed suicide when Blanche told him she was disgusted with him. The story touches Mitch, who tells Blanche that they need each other. It seems certain that they will get married.\n\nLater on, Stanley repeats gossip to Stella that he has gathered on Blanche, telling her that Blanche was fired from her teaching job for involvement with an under-aged student and that she lived at a hotel known for prostitution (the Flamingo). Stella erupts in anger over Stanley's cruelty after he states that he has also told Mitch about the rumors, but the fight is cut short as she goes into labor and is sent to the hospital.\n\nAs Blanche waits at home alone, Mitch arrives and confronts Blanche with the stories that Stanley has told him. At first she denies everything, but eventually confesses that the stories are true. She pleads for forgiveness, but an angry and humiliated Mitch refuses her the chance at an honorable relationship and attempts to sexually assault her instead. In response, Blanche screams \"fire\", and he runs away in fright.\n\nHours before Stella has the baby, Stanley and Blanche are left alone in the apartment. Blanche has descended into a fantasy that an old suitor of hers is coming to provide financial support and take her away from New Orleans. Stanley goes along with the act before angrily scorning Blanche's lies and behavior, and advances toward her; in response, she threatens to [[Glassing|glass]] him, but is overpowered. Stanley rapes Blanche, imminently resulting in her psychotic crisis.\n\nWeeks later, at another poker game at the Kowalski apartment, Stella and her neighbor, Eunice, are packing Blanche's belongings. Blanche has suffered a complete mental breakdown and is to be committed to a mental hospital. Although Blanche has told Stella about Stanley's assault, Stella cannot bring herself to believe her sister's story. When a doctor and a matron arrive to take Blanche to the hospital, she initially resists them and collapses on the floor in confusion. Mitch, present at the poker game, breaks down in tears. When the doctor helps Blanche up, she goes willingly with him, saying: \"Whoever you are \u2013 I have always depended on the kindness of strangers.\" The play ends with Stanley continuing to comfort Stella, but also inserting his hand into her blouse, while the poker game continues uninterrupted, as Steve says: \"This game is seven-card stud.\"\n\n==Stage productions==\n\n===Original Broadway production===\n{{Multiple image |direction = vertical | width = 250\n|image1=Marlon Brando Streetcar 1948 e.jpg\n|alt1=Brando leaning with his arms folded\n|image2=Van Vechten Marlon Brando image 170904.jpg\n|alt2=Brando with no shirt\n|caption2=[[Carl Van Vechten]] portrait photograph of [[Marlon Brando]] during the Broadway production of ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' (December 27, 1948)}}\nThe original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production was produced by [[Irene Mayer Selznick]].<ref name=\"ibdb\"/> It opened at the Shubert in New Haven in early November 1947, then played the Walnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia before moving to the [[Ethel Barrymore Theatre]] on December 3, 1947.<ref name=\"ibdb\" /> Selznick originally wanted to cast [[Margaret Sullavan]] and [[John Garfield]], but settled on [[Jessica Tandy]] and [[Marlon Brando]], who were virtual unknowns at the time. The opening night cast also included [[Kim Hunter]] as Stella and [[Karl Malden]] as Mitch.<ref name=\"ibdb\"/> Tandy was cast after Williams saw her performance in a West Coast production of his one-act play ''[[Portrait of a Madonna]]''. Williams believed that casting Brando, who was young for the part as it was originally conceived, would evolve Kowalski from being a vicious older man to someone whose unintentional cruelty can be attributed to youthful ignorance. Despite its shocking scenes and gritty dialogue, the audience applauded the debut performance.<ref>December 3, ''This Day In History Calendar (2008).'' Sourcebooks, Inc.</ref>\n[[Brooks Atkinson]], reviewing the opening in ''[[The New York Times]]'', described Tandy's \"superb performance\" as \"almost incredibly true,\" concluding that Williams \"has spun a poignant and luminous story.\"<ref>Brooks Atkinson, [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/04/23/theater/20120423-streetcar.html?_r=0 \"First Night at the Theatre\"], ''New York Times'', December 4, 1947.</ref>\nLater in the run, [[Uta Hagen]] replaced Tandy, [[Carmelita Pope]] replaced Hunter, and [[Anthony Quinn]] replaced Brando. Hagen and Quinn took the show on a national tour and then returned to Broadway for additional performances. Early on, when Brando broke his nose, [[Jack Palance]] took over his role. [[Ralph Meeker]] also took on the part of Stanley both in the Broadway and touring companies. Tandy received a [[Tony Award]] for Best Actress in a Play in 1948, sharing the honor with [[Judith Anderson]]'s portrayal of [[Medea]] and with [[Katharine Cornell]].\n\n[[Uta Hagen]]'s Blanche on the national tour was directed not by [[Elia Kazan]], who had directed the Broadway production, but by [[Harold Clurman]], and it has been reported, both in interviews by Hagen and observations by contemporary critics, that the Clurman-directed interpretation shifted the focus of audience sympathy back to Blanche and away from Stanley (where the Kazan version had located it). This was the original conception of the play, and has been reflected in subsequent revivals.\n\nThe original Broadway production closed, after 855 performances, in 1949.\n\n====Original cast====\n* [[Jessica Tandy]] as [[Blanche DuBois]]\n* [[Karl Malden]] as Harold \"Mitch\" Mitchell\n* [[Marlon Brando]] as [[Stanley Kowalski]]\n* [[Kim Hunter]] as [[Stella Kowalski]]\n* [[Rudy Bond]] as Steve Hubbell\n* [[Nick Dennis]] as Pablo Gonzales\n* [[Peg Hillias]] as Eunice Hubbell\n* Vito Christi as Young Collector\n* [[Richard Garrick]] as Doctor\n* Ann Dere as Nurse (later called the Matron)\n* Gee Gee James as Negro Woman\n* Edna Thomas as Mexican Woman\n\n===Original London production===\nThe London production, directed by [[Laurence Olivier]], opened at the [[Aldwych Theatre]] on October 12, 1949.

Pawley, as noted in the ''Streetcar'' edition of the \"Plays in Production\" series published by [[Cambridge University Press]]. The black and cross-gendered productions of ''Streetcar'' since the mid-1950s are too numerous to list here.\n\nThe first adaptation of ''Streetcar'' in Greece was performed in 1948 by Koun's Art Theater, two years before its film adaptation and one year before its London premiere, directed by [[Karolos Koun]] starring Academy Award nominated actress [[Melina Mercouri]] as Blanche and [[Vasilis Diamantopoulos]] as Stanley, with original music by [[Manos Hadjidakis]]. Thus the second Oscar-nominated actress to play the part of Blanche Dubois was Melina Mercouri and not Vivien Leigh. Koun became personally acquainted with Tennessee Williams in 1952, while visiting the US under a [[Fulbright Scholarship]] at Yale University, under the [[Smith\u2013Mundt Act]] of 1948. He was very impressed by Williams and continued to adapt his plays in Greece for decades. Tennessee Williams remains even today one of the most widely adapted playwrights (if not the most adapted) in Greece.\n\n[[Tallulah Bankhead]], for whom Williams originally had written the role of Blanche, starred in a 1956 New York City Center Company production directed by Herbert Machiz.\n\nThe first Broadway revival of the play was in 1973. It was produced by the [[Lincoln Center]], at the [[Vivian Beaumont Theater]], and starred [[Rosemary Harris]] as Blanche, [[James Farentino]] as Stanley and [[Patricia Conolly]] as Stella.<ref>{{cite web|last=Barnes |first=Clive |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0F16F8395C1A7A93C5AB178FD85F478785F9&scp=2&sq=the%20streetcar%20named%20desire,%20lincoln%20center,%20ellis%20rabb&st=cse |title=A Rare 'Streetcar'; Fresh Approach Taken at Vivian Beaumont |newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 27, 1973 |accessdate=September 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn a 1992 episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', \"[[A Streetcar Named Marge]]\", a musical version of the play, ''Oh, Streetcar!'', was featured. [[Ned Flanders]] and [[Marge Simpson]] took the leading roles as Stanley and Blanche, respectively.\n\nThe spring 1988 revival at the [[Circle in the Square Theatre]] starred [[Aidan Quinn]] opposite [[Blythe Danner]] as Blanche and [[Frances McDormand]] as Stella.<ref>Production notes. [http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=4496 March 10 \u2013 May 22, 1988.]  IBDb.com</ref>\n\nA highly publicized revival in 1992 starred [[Alec Baldwin]] as Stanley and [[Jessica Lange]] as Blanche. It was staged at the [[Ethel Barrymore Theatre]], the same theatre that the original production was staged in. This production proved so successful that it was filmed for television. It featured [[Timothy Carhart]] as Mitch and [[Amy Madigan]] as Stella, as well as future ''[[The Sopranos|Sopranos]]'' stars [[James Gandolfini]] and [[Aida Turturro]]. Gandolfini was Carhart's understudy.<ref>Production notes.

Blanche is in her thirties and, with no money, has nowhere else to go.\n\nBlanche tells Stella that she has taken a leave of absence from her English-teaching position because of her nerves (which is later revealed to be a lie). Blanche laments the shabbiness of her sister's two-room flat. She finds Stanley loud and rough, eventually referring to him as \"common\". Stanley, in return, does not care for Blanche's manners and dislikes her presence.\n\nStanley later questions Blanche about her earlier marriage. Blanche had married when she was very young, but her husband died, leaving her widowed and alone. The memory of her dead husband causes Blanche some obvious distress. Stanley, worried that he has been cheated out of an inheritance, demands to know what happened to Belle Reve, once a large plantation and the DuBois family home. Blanche hands over all the documents pertaining to Belle Reve. While looking at the papers, Stanley notices a bundle of letters that Blanche emotionally proclaims are personal love letters from her dead husband. For a moment, Stanley seems caught off guard over her proclaimed feelings. Afterwards, he informs Blanche that Stella is going to have a baby. This can be seen as the start of Blanche's mental upheaval.\n\nThe night after Blanche's arrival, during one of Stanley's poker games, Blanche meets Mitch, one of Stanley's poker player buddies. His courteous manner sets him apart from the other men. Their chat becomes flirtatious and friendly, and Blanche easily charms him; they like each other. Suddenly becoming upset over multiple interruptions, Stanley explodes in a drunken rage and strikes Stella. Blanche and Stella take refuge with the upstairs neighbor, Eunice. When Stanley recovers, he cries out from the courtyard below for Stella to come back by repeatedly calling her name until she comes down and allows herself to be carried off to bed. After Stella returns to Stanley, Blanche and Mitch sit at the bottom of the steps in the courtyard, where Mitch apologizes for Stanley's coarse behavior.\n\nBlanche is bewildered that Stella would go back to her abusive husband after such violence. The next morning, Blanche rushes to Stella and describes Stanley as a subhuman animal, though Stella assures Blanche that she and Stanley are fine. Stanley overhears the conversation but keeps silent. When Stanley comes in, Stella hugs and kisses him, letting Blanche know that her low opinion of Stanley does not matter.\n\nAs the weeks pass, the friction between Blanche and Stanley continues to grow. Blanche has hope in Mitch, and tells Stella that she wants to go away with him and not be anyone's problem. During a meeting between the two, Blanche confesses to Mitch that once she was married to a young man, Allan Grey, whom she later discovered in a sexual encounter with an older man. Grey later committed suicide when Blanche told him she was disgusted with him. The story touches Mitch, who tells Blanche that they need each other. It seems certain that they will get married.\n\nLater on, Stanley repeats gossip to Stella that he has gathered on Blanche, telling her that Blanche was fired from her teaching job for involvement with an under-aged student and that she lived at a hotel known for prostitution (the Flamingo). Stella erupts in anger over Stanley's cruelty after he states that he has also told Mitch about the rumors, but the fight is cut short as she goes into labor and is sent to the hospital.\n\nAs Blanche waits at home alone, Mitch arrives and confronts Blanche with the stories that Stanley has told him. At first she denies everything, but eventually confesses that the stories are true. She pleads for forgiveness, but an angry and humiliated Mitch refuses her the chance at an honorable relationship and attempts to sexually assault her instead. In response, Blanche screams \"fire\", and he runs away in fright.\n\nHours before Stella has the baby, Stanley and Blanche are left alone in the apartment. Blanche has descended into a fantasy that an old suitor of hers is coming to provide financial support and take her away from New Orleans. Stanley goes along with the act before angrily scorning Blanche's lies and behavior, and advances toward her; in response, she threatens to [[Glassing|glass]] him, but is overpowered. Stanley rapes Blanche, imminently resulting in her psychotic crisis.\n\nWeeks later, at another poker game at the Kowalski apartment, Stella and her neighbor, Eunice, are packing Blanche's belongings. Blanche has suffered a complete mental breakdown and is to be committed to a mental hospital. Although Blanche has told Stella about Stanley's assault, Stella cannot bring herself to believe her sister's story. When a doctor and a matron arrive to take Blanche to the hospital, she initially resists them and collapses on the floor in confusion. Mitch, present at the poker game, breaks down in tears. When the doctor helps Blanche up, she goes willingly with him, saying: \"Whoever you are \u2013 I have always depended on the kindness of strangers.\" The play ends with Stanley continuing to comfort Stella, but also inserting his hand into her blouse, while the poker game continues uninterrupted, as Steve says: \"This game is seven-card stud.\"\n\n==Stage productions==\n\n===Original Broadway production===\n{{Multiple image |direction = vertical | width = 250\n|image1=Marlon Brando Streetcar 1948 e.jpg\n|alt1=Brando leaning with his arms folded\n|image2=Van Vechten Marlon Brando image 170904.jpg\n|alt2=Brando with no shirt\n|caption2=[[Carl Van Vechten]] portrait photograph of [[Marlon Brando]] during the Broadway production of ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' (December 27, 1948)}}\nThe original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production was produced by [[Irene Mayer Selznick]].<ref name=\"ibdb\"/> It opened at the Shubert in New Haven in early November 1947, then played the Walnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia before moving to the [[Ethel Barrymore Theatre]] on December 3, 1947.<ref name=\"ibdb\" /> Selznick originally wanted to cast [[Margaret Sullavan]] and [[John Garfield]], but settled on [[Jessica Tandy]] and [[Marlon Brando]], who were virtual unknowns at the time. The opening night cast also included [[Kim Hunter]] as Stella and [[Karl Malden]] as Mitch.<ref name=\"ibdb\"/> Tandy was cast after Williams saw her performance in a West Coast production of his one-act play ''[[Portrait of a Madonna]]''. Williams believed that casting Brando, who was young for the part as it was originally conceived, would evolve Kowalski from being a vicious older man to someone whose unintentional cruelty can be attributed to youthful ignorance. Despite its shocking scenes and gritty dialogue, the audience applauded the debut performance.<ref>December 3, ''This Day In History Calendar (2008).'' Sourcebooks, Inc.</ref>\n[[Brooks Atkinson]], reviewing the opening in ''[[The New York Times]]'', described Tandy's \"superb performance\" as \"almost incredibly true,\" concluding that Williams \"has spun a poignant and luminous story.\"<ref>Brooks Atkinson, [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/04/23/theater/20120423-streetcar.html?_r=0 \"First Night at the Theatre\"], ''New York Times'', December 4, 1947.</ref>\nLater in the run, [[Uta Hagen]] replaced Tandy, [[Carmelita Pope]] replaced Hunter, and [[Anthony Quinn]] replaced Brando. Hagen and Quinn took the show on a national tour and then returned to Broadway for additional performances. Early on, when Brando broke his nose, [[Jack Palance]] took over his role. [[Ralph Meeker]] also took on the part of Stanley both in the Broadway and touring companies. Tandy received a [[Tony Award]] for Best Actress in a Play in 1948, sharing the honor with [[Judith Anderson]]'s portrayal of [[Medea]] and with [[Katharine Cornell]].\n\n[[Uta Hagen]]'s Blanche on the national tour was directed not by [[Elia Kazan]], who had directed the Broadway production, but by [[Harold Clurman]], and it has been reported, both in interviews by Hagen and observations by contemporary critics, that the Clurman-directed interpretation shifted the focus of audience sympathy back to Blanche and away from Stanley (where the Kazan version had located it). This was the original conception of the play, and has been reflected in subsequent revivals.\n\nThe original Broadway production closed, after 855 performances, in 1949.\n\n====Original cast====\n* [[Jessica Tandy]] as [[Blanche DuBois]]\n* [[Karl Malden]] as Harold \"Mitch\" Mitchell\n* [[Marlon Brando]] as [[Stanley Kowalski]]\n* [[Kim Hunter]] as [[Stella Kowalski]]\n* [[Rudy Bond]] as Steve Hubbell\n* [[Nick Dennis]] as Pablo Gonzales\n* [[Peg Hillias]] as Eunice Hubbell\n* Vito Christi as Young Collector\n* [[Richard Garrick]] as Doctor\n* Ann Dere as Nurse (later called the Matron)\n* Gee Gee James as Negro Woman\n* Edna Thomas as Mexican Woman\n\n===Original London production===\nThe London production, directed by [[Laurence Olivier]], opened at the [[Aldwych Theatre]] on October 12, 1949.

Pawley, as noted in the ''Streetcar'' edition of the \"Plays in Production\" series published by [[Cambridge University Press]]. The black and cross-gendered productions of ''Streetcar'' since the mid-1950s are too numerous to list here.\n\nThe first adaptation of ''Streetcar'' in Greece was performed in 1948 by Koun's Art Theater, two years before its film adaptation and one year before its London premiere, directed by [[Karolos Koun]] starring Academy Award nominated actress [[Melina Mercouri]] as Blanche and [[Vasilis Diamantopoulos]] as Stanley, with original music by [[Manos Hadjidakis]]. Thus the second Oscar-nominated actress to play the part of Blanche Dubois was Melina Mercouri and not Vivien Leigh. Koun became personally acquainted with Tennessee Williams in 1952, while visiting the US under a [[Fulbright Scholarhsip]] at Yale University, under the [[Smith\u2013Mundt Act]] of 1948. He was very impressed by Williams and continued to adapt his plays in Greece for decades. Tennessee Williams remains even today one of the most widely adapted playwrights (if not the most adapted) in Greece.\n\n[[Tallulah Bankhead]], for whom Williams originally had written the role of Blanche, starred in a 1956 New York City Center Company production directed by Herbert Machiz.\n\nThe first Broadway revival of the play was in 1973.

It was staged at the [[Ethel Barrymore Theatre]], the same theatre that the original production was staged in. This production proved so successful that it was filmed for television. It featured [[Timothy Carhart]] as Mitch and [[Amy Madigan]] as Stella, as well as future ''[[The Sopranos|Sopranos]]'' stars [[James Gandolfini]] and [[Aida Turturro]].

The male can be recognized by its large fore limbs, thumbs, and webbing.
