Just as they finish the rescue, Woody watches as Bo is donated to a new owner, and considers going with her, but ultimately decides to remain with Andy. [[Toy Story 3|Years later]], a teenage Andy donates them to Bonnie, a younger child, before he goes off to college. While the toys are grateful to have a new child, Woody struggles to adapt to an environment where he is not the favorite as he was with Andy, apparent when Bonnie takes Woody's sheriff badge and puts it on [[Jessie (Toy Story)|Jessie]] instead, not even bothering to give him a role during her playtime.\n\nOn the day of Bonnie's kindergarten orientation, Woody worries over her and sneaks into her backpack. After a classmate takes away Bonnie's arts and crafts supplies, Woody covertly recovers the materials and various pieces of garbage from the trash, including a plastic [[spork]]. Bonnie uses these to create a bipedal spork with googly eyes, whom she dubs \"[[Forky]]\". Forky comes to life in Bonnie's backpack and begins to experience an [[existential crisis]], thinking he is garbage rather than a toy and wishing to remain in a trash can. As Forky becomes Bonnie's favorite toy, Woody takes it upon himself to prevent Forky from throwing himself away.\n\nWhen Bonnie's family goes on a [[road trip]], Forky jumps out of the RV window, and Woody pursues him. After Woody explains how important he is to Bonnie, Forky decides to accompany Woody and return to her. Near the RV park where Bonnie's family is staying, Woody spots Bo Peep's lamp in an antique store window and goes in, hoping to find her. Inside, he and Forky encounter a [[Chatty Cathy|talking doll]] named Gabby Gabby, who desires Woody's voice box to replace her broken one. While Woody is able to escape, Gabby captures Forky. At a playground, Woody is reunited with Bo Peep and her sheep Billy, Goat, and Gruff, who now live as \"lost\" toys that are not dedicated to one child. Bo agrees to help Woody save Forky and get back to Bonnie.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Buzz Lightyear|Buzz]] searches for Woody but gets lost at a fairground and becomes a [[carnival game]] prize. He escapes with plush toys Ducky and Bunny, and they meet up with Woody and Bo. With the help of [[Polly Pocket|pocket toy]] cop Giggle McDimples and stuntman toy Duke Caboom, they unsuccessfully try to rescue Forky from Gabby, her [[Ventriloquism|ventriloquist puppet]] henchmen, and the store owner's cat. In the aftermath of the failed rescue, Bo and the other toys argue over whether to go back. Woody declares that rescuing Forky is his remaining purpose and tells Bo that being loyal is something a lost toy would not understand. Alone, Woody encounters Gabby again, who expresses her longing for a child's love. Woody sympathizes with her plight and willingly trades his voice box for Forky.\n\nThe toys part ways, but Woody watches Gabby as she is rejected by her ideal owner, Harmony. Woody comforts a heartbroken Gabby and invites her to become one of Bonnie's toys. Bo returns with the others to help and reconciles with Woody. They head for the carnival, while Forky fetches Buzz and Bonnie's toys; they interfere with the RV's controls, forcing Bonnie's father to drive back to the carnival. When Gabby sees a crying girl lost in the carnival, she decides instead to become that child's toy, emboldening the child to approach a security guard and be reunited with her parents.\n\nAt the carousel, Woody and Bo share a bittersweet goodbye, but Woody is hesitant to leave Bo again. After Buzz tells Woody that Bonnie will be okay even without him, Woody decides to stay with Bo instead of returning to Bonnie. Woody passes his sheriff badge over to Jessie and bids a heartfelt farewell to his friends.\n\nWoody and Bo begin a life together with Ducky, Bunny, Giggle, and Duke, dedicated to finding new owners for lost toys. On her first day of first grade, Bonnie creates a second impromptu toy out of a plastic knife, who suffers the same existential crisis as Forky once did, who immediately becomes smitten with her.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{{Main|List of Toy Story characters}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as [[Sheriff Woody|Woody]]<ref name=YahooHanksUpdate />\n* [[Tim Allen]] as [[Buzz Lightyear]]<ref name=\"TheWrap\" />\n* [[Annie Potts]] as [[Bo Peep (Toy Story)|Bo Peep]]<ref name=\"bo peep\">{{cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/movies/2019/01/28/toy-story-4-teaser-bo-peep-return/|title='Toy Story 4': Bo Peep Officially Returns in New Teaser|first=Charles|last=Ridgley|date=January 28, 2019|accessdate=January 28, 2019|work=Comicbook.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190128225301/https://comicbook.com/movies/2019/01/28/toy-story-4-teaser-bo-peep-return/|archive-date=January 28, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Tony Hale]] as [[Forky]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/toy-story-4-teaser-trailer/|title=Toy Story 4 Teaser Trailer Introduces New Non-Toy Character|website=www.slashfilm.com|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181112210851/https://www.slashfilm.com/toy-story-4-teaser-trailer/|archive-date=November 12, 2018|url-status=live|date=November 12, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\" TheHollywood Reporter\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/toy-story-4-teaser-trailer-new-character-forky-joins-toys-1160313 |title='Toy Story 4' Teaser Trailer Introduces New Toy Forky |date=November 12, 2018 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |language=en-US |access-date=November 12, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181112210905/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/toy-story-4-teaser-trailer-new-character-forky-joins-toys-1160313 |archivedate=November 12, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* [[Keegan-Michael Key]] as [[List of Toy Story characters#Ducky|Ducky]]<ref name=\"DuckyBunny\" />\n* [[Jordan Peele]] as [[List of Toy Story characters#Bunny|Bunny]]<ref name=\"DuckyBunny\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/11/13/toy-story-4-new-teaser-introduces-ducky-bunny-played-by-key-peele|title=Toy Story 4: New trailer introduces Ducky and Bunny, played by Key and Peele|website=IGN|date=November 13, 2018|access-date=November 13, 2018|first=Joe|last=Skrebels|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113155053/https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/11/13/toy-story-4-new-teaser-introduces-ducky-bunny-played-by-key-peele|archive-date=November 13, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.avclub.com/key-and-peele-reprise-one-of-their-best-bits-in-this-ne-1830410355|title=Key and Peele reprise one of their best bits in this new Toy Story 4 clip|first=Dan|last=Neilan|date=November 13, 2018|accessdate=November 13, 2018|work=[[The A.V.

Just as they finish the rescue, Woody watches as Bo is donated to a new owner, and considers going with her, but ultimately decides to remain with Andy. [[Toy Story 3|Years later]], a teenage Andy donates them to Bonnie, a younger child, before he goes off to college. While the toys are grateful to have a new child, Woody struggles to adapt to an environment where he is not the favorite as he was with Andy, apparent when Bonnie takes Woody's sheriff badge and puts it on [[Jessie (Toy Story)|Jessie]] instead, not even bothering to give him a role during her playtime.\n\nOn the day of Bonnie's kindergarten orientation, Woody worries over her and sneaks into her backpack. After a classmate takes away Bonnie's arts and crafts supplies, Woody covertly recovers the materials and various pieces of garbage from the trash, including a plastic [[spork]]. Bonnie uses these to create a bipedal spork with googly eyes, whom she dubs \"[[Forky]]\". Forky comes to life in Bonnie's backpack and begins to experience an [[existential crisis]], thinking he is garbage rather than a toy and wishing to remain in a trash can. As Forky becomes Bonnie's favorite toy, Woody takes it upon himself to prevent Forky from throwing himself away.\n\nWhen Bonnie's family goes on a [[road trip]], Forky jumps out of the RV window, and Woody pursues him. After Woody explains how important he is to Bonnie, Forky decides to accompany Woody and return to her. Near the RV park where Bonnie's family is staying, Woody spots Bo Peep's lamp in an antique store window and goes in, hoping to find her. Inside, he and Forky encounter a [[Chatty Cathy|talking doll]] named Gabby Gabby, who desires Woody's voice box to replace her broken one. While Woody is able to escape, Gabby captures Forky. At a playground, Woody is reunited with Bo Peep and her sheep Billy, Goat, and Gruff, who now live as \"lost\" toys that are not dedicated to one child. Bo agrees to help Woody save Forky and get back to Bonnie.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Buzz Lightyear|Buzz]] searches for Woody but gets lost at a fairground and becomes a [[carnival game]] prize. He escapes with plush toys Ducky and Bunny, and they meet up with Woody and Bo. With the help of [[Polly Pocket|pocket toy]] cop Giggle McDimples and stuntman toy Duke Caboom, they unsuccessfully try to rescue Forky from Gabby, her [[Ventriloquism|ventriloquist puppet]] henchmen, and the store owner's cat. In the aftermath of the failed rescue, Bo and the other toys argue over whether to go back. Woody declares that rescuing Forky is his remaining purpose and tells Bo that being loyal is something a lost toy wouldn't understand. Alone, Woody encounters Gabby again, who expresses her longing for a child's love. Woody sympathizes with her plight and willingly trades his voice box for Forky.\n\nThe toys part ways, but Woody watches Gabby as she is rejected by her ideal owner, Harmony. Woody comforts a heartbroken Gabby and invites her to become one of Bonnie's toys. Bo returns with the others to help and reconciles with Woody. They head for the carnival, while Forky fetches Buzz and Bonnie's toys; they interfere with the RV's controls, forcing Bonnie's father to drive back to the carnival. When Gabby sees a crying girl lost in the carnival, she decides instead to become that child's toy, emboldening the child to approach a security guard and be reunited with her parents.\n\nAt the carousel, Woody and Bo share a bittersweet goodbye, but Woody is hesitant to leave Bo again. After Buzz tells Woody that Bonnie will be okay even without him, Woody decides to stay with Bo instead of returning to Bonnie. Woody passes his sheriff badge over to Jessie and bids a heartfelt farewell to his friends.\n\nWoody and Bo begin a life together with Ducky, Bunny, Giggle, and Duke, dedicated to finding new owners for lost toys. On her first day of first grade, Bonnie creates a second impromptu toy out of a plastic knife, who suffers the same existential crisis as Forky once did, who immediately becomes smitten with her.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{{Main|List of Toy Story characters}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as [[Sheriff Woody|Woody]]<ref name=YahooHanksUpdate />\n* [[Tim Allen]] as [[Buzz Lightyear]]<ref name=\"TheWrap\" />\n* [[Annie Potts]] as [[Bo Peep (Toy Story)|Bo Peep]]<ref name=\"bo peep\">{{cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/movies/2019/01/28/toy-story-4-teaser-bo-peep-return/|title='Toy Story 4': Bo Peep Officially Returns in New Teaser|first=Charles|last=Ridgley|date=January 28, 2019|accessdate=January 28, 2019|work=Comicbook.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190128225301/https://comicbook.com/movies/2019/01/28/toy-story-4-teaser-bo-peep-return/|archive-date=January 28, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Tony Hale]] as [[Forky]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/toy-story-4-teaser-trailer/|title=Toy Story 4 Teaser Trailer Introduces New Non-Toy Character|website=www.slashfilm.com|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181112210851/https://www.slashfilm.com/toy-story-4-teaser-trailer/|archive-date=November 12, 2018|url-status=live|date=November 12, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\" TheHollywood Reporter\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/toy-story-4-teaser-trailer-new-character-forky-joins-toys-1160313 |title='Toy Story 4' Teaser Trailer Introduces New Toy Forky |date=November 12, 2018 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |language=en-US |access-date=November 12, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181112210905/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/toy-story-4-teaser-trailer-new-character-forky-joins-toys-1160313 |archivedate=November 12, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* [[Keegan-Michael Key]] as [[List of Toy Story characters#Ducky|Ducky]]<ref name=\"DuckyBunny\" />\n* [[Jordan Peele]] as [[List of Toy Story characters#Bunny|Bunny]]<ref name=\"DuckyBunny\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/11/13/toy-story-4-new-teaser-introduces-ducky-bunny-played-by-key-peele|title=Toy Story 4: New trailer introduces Ducky and Bunny, played by Key and Peele|website=IGN|date=November 13, 2018|access-date=November 13, 2018|first=Joe|last=Skrebels|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113155053/https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/11/13/toy-story-4-new-teaser-introduces-ducky-bunny-played-by-key-peele|archive-date=November 13, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.avclub.com/key-and-peele-reprise-one-of-their-best-bits-in-this-ne-1830410355|title=Key and Peele reprise one of their best bits in this new Toy Story 4 clip|first=Dan|last=Neilan|date=November 13, 2018|accessdate=November 13, 2018|work=[[The A.V.

The game plays similar to [[Angry Birds Epic]], also developed by [[Chimera Entertainment]], with the exception that a player is slinging birds toward the enemies to defeat them instead of using weapons.\n\nThe game has received the Editor's Choice award on the [[Google Play Store]].<ref>[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rovio.tnt Angry Birds Evolution - Android Apps on Google Play] Google, Retrieved August 28, 2017.</ref> According to mobile research firm Sensor Tower, it has grossed more than $30 million worldwide, as of July 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sensortower.com/blog/angry-birds-evolution-revenue-30-million|title=Angry Birds Evolution Revenue Flies Past $30 Million Worldwide|website=Sensortower.com|date=2018-07-09|access-date=2019-06-23|first=Randy|last=Nelson}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe game was first discovered in July 2016 under the [[working title]] ''TNT'' when the fan website AngryBirdsNest began hosting an open beta for the game.  The open beta period ran from July 11, 2016 to August 3, 2016, and was only available on [[iOS]].  After the beta ended, the game was [[Soft launch|soft-launched]] in [[Hong Kong]] on August 17, 2016, then was released in more Asian countries in October 2016. On June 15, 2017, the game received a final, global release.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThis game is a [[turn-based]] [[role-playing game]], like ''[[Angry Birds Epic]]'', but its battles incorporate the pinball-like elements of ''[[Angry Birds Action!]]'', in the sense that the player launches birds at a handful of pigs in a rectangular battlefield, bouncing off of its boundaries, obstacles and enemies strategically to cause as much damage as possible and achieve victory.  Each pig will attack after a certain number of turns pass, while birds will be able to use a special move, determined by their [[plumage]] color, once their fury builds up after a series of turns.  Defeating all pigs would result in victory while allowing the pigs to drain the birds' shared health bar will result in a defeat, unless the player decides to [[In-app purchase|pay gems]] to replenish some health and keep going.\n\nWinning a battle will grant the player rewards, such as coins, evolution material and eggs.  In most regions of the game world, eggs won from these battles will only produce a bird of a particular plumage, depending on what zone the battle was fought in (i.e. battles won in the Yellow Desert would produce eggs for yellow birds).  Eggs can also be hatched at the Bird Town to obtain new characters, with a chance to collect characters from ''[[The Angry Birds Movie]]'', namely [[The Angry Birds Movie#Plot|Matilda and her four anger management students]] (events only) and the elderly [[The Angry Birds Movie#Cast|Shirley]].  Birds can only be leveled-up outside of battles, where a bird that wants to level up would be fused with another bird that is then discarded, and once their level cap is reached, the player must spend evolution material to \"evolve\" them, raise their level cap and generally increase their power rating.\n\nThe game has a single-player campaign mode where players set out on a quest to stop the pigs from imperiling the Angry Birds' eggs as usual, as well as thwart the schemes of Bacon Corp and its leader Don Bacon, and involves traveling across multiple zones of the game world, each with different terrain.  Most areas will empower birds of a certain plumage, allowing them to inflict twice as much damage, and every time a battle is won, it cannot be played again.  After every few battles, however, the player will be unable to advance further until two missions are completed by sending out scouts to collect items or reveal battles that can be fought.  Up to three scouts can be deployed at once,(unless the clan scout is activated) but players must wait one hour before each one can be used again, or skip the wait by paying gems or feeding berries to the exhausted scouts.\n\nIt is also possible to participate in [[player versus player|player-versus-player]] matches, which take place in the Oink-tagon, or wherever scouts reveal such a battle.   Two players take turns using their bird squads to knock pigs towards their opponent's half of the arena so that they will attack their squad, but can also defeat the pigs to automatically damage the opponent or otherwise gain a small advantage against their opponent.  The player who drains their opponent's health bar wins.  Players are ranked by how well they play in arena matches in a week-long season, and are rewarded proportionally based on their performance.  Since an update in spring 2018, each season may have new rules that grant bigger ranking jumps to players who win with a certain combination of birds, as well as buffs or nerfs to the pigs and/or birds in the arena.\n\nPlayers can also join clans for perks in battle. Perks are unlocked depending on the clan's level. The clan perks are clan buffs: have clan health and clan smartbomb, clan egg: get an extra egg after winning battle (excluding [[Player versus player|PvP]] and [[PvE]]), clan trophy boost: get more trophies after winning PvP (excluding PvE after update 1.17), clan coin boost: get extra coins after winning battle, and clan scout: get an extra scout and decrease time for scouts to become available again. Clans can be leveled up by donating coins or activating/increasing time for perks. There are four clan member types Member: no special rights, Elder: ban members, invite new members, co-leader: same as leader but cannot promote or demote leaders, and leader: edit clan details, promote and demote members, ban members, manage invitations, invite new members. There are four clans types for joining that anyone can join: open to anyone, invite only: must be invited to join, request only: must request and have request excepted to join, and closed: cannot join.\n\nThroughout the game's operation, special events become available to all players for a limited amount of time, with new ones added after each subsequent update.  Major events provide opportunities to unlock either Matilda and her anger management students, members of a bird rock band, or a handful of newly introduced, powerful birds.  In such events, players must gather special event currency throughout the game map, battles and in Bird Town as well to earn more and more prizes, while being encouraged to hatch as many premium eggs as possible to increase their chances of earning a certain event bird, which would reset once he/she is hatched.  Other shorter events, such as the Pirate Brawl, has players racing to win as much event currency as possible across a couple of days to earn helpful rewards.\n\n==Reception==\nJulie Muncy of [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] criticized the game's gameplay (\"you slingshot your birds in classic Angry Birds fashion, sending them careening around tiny combat arenas [...] None of this really works.\"), sound design and [[Popular culture|pop culture]] references, referring to it as a \"cash-in.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/story/angry-birds-evolution-review/|title=Glimpse the Dark Heart of Branding with ''Angry Birds Evolution''|first=Julie|last=Muncy|date=2017-06-26|accessdate=2019-06-23|website=Wired.com}}</ref> Pavan Shamdasani of the [[South China Morning Post]] was similarly critical of the game, noting its \"unoriginal elements\" in both gameplay and visual design.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/culture/arts-entertainment/article/2102000/game-review-angry-birds-evolution-boring-and-lacks|title=Game review: Angry Birds Evolution is boring and lacks staying power \u2013 just like the movie|first=Pavan|last=Shamdasani|date=2017-07-11|accessdate=2019-06-23|website=Scmp.com}}</ref> Emily Sowden of [[Pocket Gamer]] was more positive in her review, writing that \"Angry Birds Evolution is a decent game at first before the usual free to play problems comes knocking.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pocketgamer.com/articles/074346/angry-birds-evolution-review-has-it-evolved-or-is-it-more-or-the-same/|title=Angry Birds Evolution review - Has it evolved or is it more or the same?|first=Emily|last=Sowden|date=2017-06-15|accessdate=2019-06-23|website=Pocketgamer.com}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Rovio Games}}\n\n[[Category:2017 video games]]\n[[Category:Android (operating system) games]]\n[[Category:IOS games]]\n[[Category:Angry Birds video games|2]]\n[[Category:Rovio Entertainment games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in Germany]]\n[[Category:Unity (game engine) games]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox video game\n| title = Angry Birds Evolution\n| image = \n| caption = \n| developer = [[Chimera Entertainment]]\n| publisher = [[Rovio Entertainment]]\n| series = ''[[Angry Birds]]''\n| engine = [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]]\n| platforms = [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]]\n| released = June 15, 2017\n| genre = [[Puzzle video game|Puzzle]], [[Role-playing game]]\n}}\n'''''Angry Birds Evolution''''', later renamed to ''Angry Birds Evolution 2020'', is a free-to-play 3-D turn-based [[Role-playing game|role-playing]] [[Puzzle video game|puzzle game]] that was released worldwide by [[Rovio Entertainment]] on June 15, 2017.
