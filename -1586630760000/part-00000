As an old tradition, the dish is eaten using one's hands, but the tradition is not always used.<ref name=\"Mansaf\"/> Simple fresh fruit is often served towards the end of a Jordanian meal, but there is also dessert, such as [[baklava]], hareeseh, [[knafeh]], [[halva]] and [[qatayef]], a dish made specially for [[Ramadan]].

Three stable kingdoms emerged there at the end of the [[Bronze Age]]: [[Ammon]], [[Moab]] and [[Edom]]. Later rulers include the [[Nabataean Kingdom]], the [[Roman Empire]], and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. After the [[Arab Revolt|Great Arab Revolt]] against the Ottomans in 1916 during [[World War I]], the [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Empire was partitioned]] by Britain and France. The [[Emirate of Transjordan]] was [[Establishment of the Emirate of Transjordan|established in 1921]] by the [[Hashemite]], then [[Emir]], [[Abdullah I of Jordan|Abdullah I]], and the emirate became a British [[protectorate]]. In 1946, Jordan became an independent state officially known as the ''Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan'', but was renamed in 1949 to the ''Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan'' after the country [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|captured]] the [[West Bank]] during the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]] and annexed it until it was lost to Israel in [[Six-Day War|1967]].

As an old tradition, the dish is eaten using one's hands, but the tradition is not always used.<ref name=\"Mansaf\"/> Simple fresh fruit is often served towards the end of a Jordanian meal, but there is also dessert, such as [[baklava]], hareeseh, [[knafeh]], [[halva]] and [[qatayef]], a dish made specially for [[Ramadan]].

The company oversees the production, broadcasting and promotion of key Viacom brands outside of the United States. These brands include [[MTV]], [[VH1]], [[Nickelodeon]], [[Comedy Central]], [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]], [[VIVA (TV station)|VIVA]], [[Colors (TV channel)|Colors]] and [[Game One]].\n\nThe networks' headquarters are located in New York City and London. Other international offices are located in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[Berlin]], Stockholm, [[Amsterdam]], [[Warsaw]], Madrid, [[Milan]], [[Mumbai]], Paris, Singapore, [[Budapest]] and Sydney amongst others. VIMN's first international offices opened in the late 1980s in London and Amsterdam with the launch of [[MTV Europe]]. VIMN was created from a rebrand of Viacom's MTV Networks, which included [[MTV]], [[VH1]] and [[Nickelodeon]], to include [[Comedy Central]]. [[Robert Bakish]] has been President of VIMN since 2011, having held various roles at Viacom since 1997.\n\n==Viacom International Media Networks divisions==\nViacom International Media Networks is currently split into 6 regional divisions. \n\n===India===\n{{Main|Viacom 18}}Viacom 18 manages the Viacom channels in India.

Since its inception on 1 January 1994, MTV Networks Asia Pacific has been providing localized channels for young audiences across Asia and Australia. Initially established as two MTV channels (MTV Asia and MTV Mandarin), MTV Networks businesses have crossed the continent and every delivery platform by catering to audiences with localized programming in eight different languages across ten MTV channels, eight Nickelodeon channels, four VH1 channels and numerous branded programming blocks across the Asia-Pacific region. The company's localization initiatives were pioneering and its rapid growth in Asia significantly contributed to MTV becoming the world's largest television network.\n\nMTV Networks Asia Pacific comprises 17 websites and 21 channels which are seen via 24-hour and programming blocks in various parts of Asia. Unlike the European and Latin American divisions, which are regulated by the headquarters' country main regulating body, the MTV Networks Asia channels are regulated by the individual country's regulation body.\n\n===Northern Europe===\n'''Viacom International Media Networks Northern Europe''' is a regional division of '''Viacom International Media Networks'''. It operates in the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] speaking part of the [[Benelux]] (Netherlands, [[Flanders]] in Belgium), Germany, Austria, German speaking part of Switzerland, the [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden), the [[Baltic states|Baltic]] (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania), Poland and Ukraine.\n\nThe Northern Europe division is run by four main offices: [[Amsterdam]], Berlin, [[Stockholm]] and [[Warsaw]].

The re-alignment will see all music programming come from its operations in Stockholm. Its Swedish offices operate local channels such as MTV and VH1 within VIMN North European's portfoilio of music channels. All kids and family programming operates from [[Berlin]] these include localized versions of [[Nickelodeon]], [[Nick Jr.]] and [[Kindernet]]. Whilst all the localized [[Comedy Central]] channels will be operated from [[Amsterdam]].  VIMN North European's portfolio includes the following territories: Austria, Belgium ([[Flanders]]), Denmark, Finland, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland (German speaking part). MTV's Amsterdam offices will remain open and will act as the technical play-out hub for the channels as well.<ref name=\"broadbandtvnews\"/>\n\n===Southern and Western Europe, Middle East and Africa===\nSee also [[Viacom International Media Networks Europe]].\n\n'''Viacom International Media Networks Africa''' (previously MTV Networks Africa) is a subsidiary of [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]].\n\nVIMN Africa includes the multimedia entertainment brands: [[MTV Africa|MTV]], [[MTV Base]], [[VH1 Europe|VH1]], [[VH1 Classic Europe|VH1 Classic]], [[Comedy Central]], [[Nickelodeon (Africa)|Nickelodeon]], [[Nicktoons]], [[Nick Jr.]] and [[BET International|BET]].\n\nSince 2006, MTV Networks Africa offices are located in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa. Previously, the networks offices were located at [[MTV Networks Europe]] headquarters in London, United Kingdom.\n\nIn November 1998, Viacom International Media Networks Europe; then MTV Networks Europe announced the creation of Nickelodeon in Africa. The channel would broadcast along with [[MTV Europe]]. A programming block launched on July 1, 1999, here Nickelodeon shows aired on MNET's children's block K-TV. In 2005, K-TV decided to cease broadcasting Nickelodeon produced programming. In 2008, VIMN Africa decided to launch a 24-hour channel across Africa.\n\n* Since MTV's launch in Europe in the late 1980s, [[MTV Europe]] was made available in some territories across Africa primarily South Africa throughout the 1990s. Gradually, as MTV began to localize its brand in Europe, [[MTV France]] and [[MTV Portugal]] were added to the boutique of channels available across the African continent on major cable and digital television platforms.\n* In 2004, MTV Networks International announced it had plans to launch its 100th channel, in Africa with the launch of MTV Africa (proposed branding). In February 2005, MTV Networks International launched [[MTV Base]] Africa. The channel was launched as with a live music special with live performances from local African and international artists.\n* In 2008, MTV Networks Internationals subsidiary MTV Networks Africa launched its first awards show aptly titled [[MTV Africa Music Awards]]. The annual event celebrates the best in music from mainstream and unsigned artists from the African continent. The award show is hosted from a different African city each year similar to its counterpart the [[MTV Europe Music Awards]].\n* As of, July 1, 2009 [[MTV Base]] Africa utilizes the on-air and online branding of MTV's other 64 global channels globally share the same on-air branding.

Initially established as two MTV channels (MTV Asia and MTV Mandarin), MTV Networks businesses have crossed the continent and every delivery platform by catering to audiences with localized programming in eight different languages across ten MTV channels, eight Nickelodeon channels, four VH1 channels and numerous branded programming blocks across the Asia-Pacific region. The company's localization initiatives were pioneering and its rapid growth in Asia significantly contributed to MTV becoming the world's largest television network.\n\nMTV Networks Asia Pacific comprises 17 websites and 21 channels which are seen via 24-hour and programming blocks in various parts of Asia. Unlike the European and Latin American divisions, which are regulated by the headquarters' country main regulating body, the MTV Networks Asia channels are regulated by the individual country's regulation body.\n\n===ViacomCBS Networks UK & Australia===\n{{Main|ViacomCBS Networks UK & Australia}}\n'''ViacomCBS Networks International UK, Northern and Eastern Europe'''<ref>https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2019/11/28/viacom-international-media-networks-names-frow-as-uk-director-of-programmes/</ref> is a regional division of ViacomCBS Networks International.

This branding makes the use of a standardised logo, idents and promos (except MTV US, MTV Canada and MTV Brazil). This is part of MTV Networks International's global branding initiative. The on-air branding titled '''Pop X1000''' reflects the changing nature of popular culture with MTV at the heart of these rapid changes. The branding was designed by MTV's design department '''World Design Studio''' in [[Milan]], with additional designs being added by other global departments throughout the year. The branding has been overseen by [[Universal Everything]]. This branding has been adopted by MTV Networks Europe, MTV Networks Asia, MTV Networks Africa and MTV Networks Latin America.

Among [[audio engineer]]s, the term ''monitor'' implies that the speaker is designed to produce relatively flat (linear) [[phase response|phase]] and [[frequency response]]s. In other words, it exhibits minimal emphasis or de-emphasis of particular frequencies, the loudspeaker gives an accurate reproduction of the tonal qualities of the source audio (\"uncolored\" or \"transparent\" are synonyms), and there will be no relative [[absolute phase|phase]] shift of particular frequencies\u2014meaning no distortion in sound-stage perspective for stereo recordings.\n\nBeyond stereo sound-stage requirements, a linear phase response helps [[impulse response]] remain true to source without encountering \"smearing\". An unqualified reference to a ''monitor'' often refers to a ''near-field'' (compact or close-field) design. This is a speaker small enough to sit on a stand or desk in proximity to the listener, so that most of the sound that the listener hears is coming directly from the speaker, rather than reflecting off of walls and ceilings (and thus picking up coloration and reverberation from the room). Monitor speakers may include more than one type of driver (e.g., a [[tweeter]] and a [[woofer]]) or, for monitoring low-frequency sounds, such as [[bass drum]], additional [[subwoofer]] cabinets may be used.\n\nThere are studio monitors designed for mid-field or far-field use as well. These tend to be used in film scoring environments, where simulation of larger sized areas like theaters is important.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.recordingbase.com/near-field-vs-far-field/|title=Near Field Vs Far Field Studio Monitors [Ultimate Guide]|last=Roy|first=Gautam|date=2018-08-03|website=Recording Base|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-18}}</ref>\n\nAlso, studio monitors are made in a more physically robust manner than home hi-fi loudspeakers; whereas home hi-fi loudspeakers often only have to reproduce [[Dynamic range compression|compressed]] commercial recordings, studio monitors have to cope with the high volumes and sudden sound bursts that may happen in the studio when playing back [[Audio mastering|unmastered]] mixes.\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:Quested HM412 main monitor, Studio 9000, PatchWerk Recording Studios, 2007.jpg|thumb|Quested HM412 main monitor, Studio 9000, PatchWerk Recording Studios]]\n[[File:Passive studio monitor Amphion.jpg|thumb|A near-field passive studio monitor by [[Amphion Loudspeakers]]]]\nBroadcasting and recording organisations employ audio engineers who use loudspeakers to assess the aesthetic merits of the programme and to tailor the balance by [[audio mixing (recorded music)|audio mixing]] and [[audio mastering|mastering]] to achieve the desired end result. Loudspeakers are also required at various points in the audio processing chain to enable engineers to ensure that the programme is reasonably free from technical defects, such as audible distortion or background noise.<ref name=1958BBCpaper>[http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/reports/1958-31.pdf \"The Development of High-Quality Monitoring Loudspeakers: A Review of Progress\"] (Expanded Version of I.EoE. Paper Read on 23 April 1958). Report No. L-041 (1958/31), The British Broadcasting Corporation</ref>\n\nThe engineer may mix programming that will sound pleasing on the widest range of playback systems used by regular listeners (i.e. [[high-end audio]], low-quality radios in [[clock radio]]s and \"[[boom box]]es\", in club [[PA system]]s, in a car stereo or a home stereo). While some broadcasters like the BBC generally believe in using monitors of \"the highest practicable standard of performance\",{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} some audio engineers argue that monitoring should be carried out with loudspeakers of mediocre technical quality to be representative of the regular systems [[end-user]]s are likely to be listening with; or that some technical defects are apparent only with high-grade reproducing equipment and therefore can be ignored.<ref name=1958BBCpaper/> However, as a public broadcaster dealing with a lot of live material, the BBC holds the view that studio monitors should be \"as free as possible from avoidable defects\". It is argued that real life low-grade sound systems are so different that it would be impossible to compensate for the characteristics of every type of system available; technical faults must not be apparent to even a minority of listeners while remaining undetected by the operating staff. It is further argued that, because of technical progress in the science of sound transmission, equipment in the studio originating the programme should have a higher standard of performance than the equipment employed in reproducing it, since the former has a longer life.<ref name=1958BBCpaper/>\n\nIn fact, most [[professional audio]] production studios have several sets of monitors spanning the range of playback systems in the market. This may include a sampling of large, expensive speakers as may be used in movie theatres, hi-fi style speakers, car speakers, portable music systems, PC speakers and consumer-grade headphones.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nAmplification: Studio monitors may be \"[[powered speakers|active]]\" (including one or more internal power amplifier(s)), or passive (these require an external [[Audio amplifier|power amplifier]]). Active models are usually [[Bi-amping|bi-amplified]], which means that the input sound signal is divided into two parts by an [[Audio crossover#Active crossovers|active crossover]] for low and high frequency components. Both parts are amplified using separate low- and high-frequency amplifiers, and then the low-frequency part is routed to a [[woofer]] and the high-frequency part is routed to a [[tweeter]] or [[Horn speaker|horn]]. Bi-amplification is done so that a cleaner overall sound reproduction can be obtained, since signals are easier to process before power amplification. Consumer loudspeakers may or may not have these various design goals.\n\n==History==\n===1920s and 1930s===\nIn the early years of the recording industry in the 1920s and 1930s, studio monitors were used primarily to check for noise interference and obvious technical problems rather than for making artistic evaluations of the performance and recording. Musicians were recorded live and the producer judged the performance on this basis, relying on simple tried-and-true microphone techniques to ensure that it had been adequately captured; playback through monitors was used simply to check that no obvious technical flaws had spoiled the original recording.\n\nAs a result, early monitors tended to be basic loudspeaker cabinets. The state-of-the-art loudspeakers of the era were massive [[horn loudspeaker|horn-loaded]] systems which were mostly used in cinemas. High-end loudspeaker design grew out of the demands of the motion picture industry and most of the early loudspeaker pioneers worked in Los Angeles where they attempted to solve the problems of cinema sound. [[Stereophonic sound]] was in its infancy, having been pioneered in Britain by an engineer who worked for [[EMI]]. Designing monitors for recording studios was not a major priority.\n\n===1940s and 1950s===\nThe first high-quality loudspeaker developed expressly as a studio monitor was the [[Altec Lansing Duplex]] 604 in 1944. This innovative driver has historically been regarded as growing out of the work of [[James Bullough Lansing]] who had previously supplied the drivers for the Shearer Horn in 1936, a speaker that had rapidly become the industry standard in motion-picture sound. He had also designed the smaller Iconic and this was widely employed at the time as a motion-picture studio monitor. The 604 was a relatively compact [[coaxial]] design and within a few years it became the industry standard in the United States, a position it maintained in its various incarnations (the 604 went through eleven model-changes) over the next 25 years. It was common in US studios throughout the 1950s and 60s and remained in continuous production until 1998.\n\n[[File:DM Recording Studio.jpg|thumb|Siemens Recording Studio ca. 1956 as seen in the Deutsches Museum in Munich Germany.]]\nIn the UK, Tannoy introduced its own coaxial design, the Dual Concentric, and this assumed the same reference role in Europe as the Altec 604 held in the US. The British Broadcasting Corporation researchers conducted evaluations on as many speakers as they could obtain in around 1948, but found commercial loudspeaker makers had little to offer that met their requirements. The BBC needed speakers that worked well with program material within real professional and domestic settings environments, and not just fulfil technical measurements such as frequency-response, distortion, monitors in anechoic chambers. Above all, the BBC required monitors to sound balanced, be neutral in tone, and lack colouration.<ref>Seydor, Paul. [https://store.theabsolutesound.com/files/images/The%20BBC%20Monitor.pdf \"The BBC Monitor\"]. ''The Absolute Sound\u2019s Illustrated History of High-End Audio'' p.306</ref> Monitor usage in the industry was highly conservative, with almost monopolistic reliance on industry \"standards\", in spite of the sonic failings of these aging designs. The Altec 604 had a notoriously ragged [[frequency response]] but almost all U.S studios continued to use it because virtually every producer and engineer knew its sound intimately and were practiced at listening through its sonic limitations.\n\nRecording through unfamiliar monitors, no matter how technically advanced, was hazardous because engineers unfamiliar with their sonic signatures could make poor production decisions and it was financially unviable to give production staff expensive studio time to familiarize themselves with new monitors. As a result, pretty well every U.S studio had a set of 604's and every European studio a Tannoy Dual Concentric or two. However, in 1959, at the height of its industry dominance, Altec made the mistake of replacing the 604 with the 605A Duplex, a design widely regarded as inferior to its predecessor. There was a backlash from some record companies and studios and this allowed Altec's competitor, JBL (a company originally started by 604 designer James B. Lansing), to make inroads into the pro monitor market.\n\n[[Capitol Records]] replaced their Altecs with JBL D50 Monitors and a few years later their UK affiliate, [[EMI]], also made the move to JBL's. Although Altec re-introduced the 604 as the \"E\" version Super Duplex in response to the criticism, they now had a major industry rival to contend with. Over the next decade most of the developments in studio monitor design originated from JBL.\n\nAs the public broadcaster in the UK, the BBC had the determinant role in defining industry standards. Its [[BBC Research & Development|renowned research departments]] invested considerable resources in determining studio monitor suited to their different broadcasting needs, and also created their own models from first principles. A 1958 research paper identified the sound goal, in a [[monaural]] system:<blockquote>It is assumed that the ideal to be aimed at in the design of a sound reproducing system is realism, i.e. that the listener should be able to imagine himself to be in the presence of the original source of sound.\n\nThere is, of course, scope for legitimate experiment in the processing of the reproduced signals in an endeavour to improve on nature, however, realism, or as near an approach to it as may be possible, ought surely to be regarded as the normal condition and avoidable departures from this state, while justified upon occasion, should not be allowed to become a permanent feature of the system.<ref name=1958BBCpaper/></blockquote>\nIn designing a loudspeaker, the BBC established the compromise that had to be established between size, weight and cost considerations. Two-way designs were preferred due to the inherently simpler crossover network, but were subject to the limitations of speaker driver technology at the time &ndash; there were few high-frequency units available at the time that functioned down to 1.5&nbsp;kHz, meaning that the woofer must operate in a predictable manner up to about 2&nbsp;kHz.<ref name=1967BBCpaper>[http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/reports/1967-57.pdf \"The Design of the Studio Monitoring Loudspeakers Types LS5/5 and LS5/6\"]. Report No. PH13 (1967/57), November 1967, The British Broadcasting Corporation</ref> The BBC developed a two-way studio monitor in 1959, the LS5/1, using a 58mm [[Celestion]] tweeter and 380mm [[Goodmans Industries|Goodmans]] bass unit, but continually had problems with consistency of the bass units. The successful testing of a 305mm bass cone made with new thermoplastics led to development and deployment of the LS5/5 and LS5/6 monitors that occupied only 60% volume of its predecessor.<ref name=1967BBCpaper/>\n\nAs recording became less and less \"live\" and [[Multitrack recording|multi-tracking]] and [[overdubbing]] became the norm, the studio monitor became far more crucial to the recording process. When there was no original performance outside what existed on the tape, the monitor became the touchstone of all engineering and production decisions. As a result, accuracy and transparency became paramount and the conservatism evident in the retention of the 604 as the standard for over twenty years began to give way to fresh technological development. Despite this, the 604 continued to be widely used - mainly because many engineers and producers were so familiar with their sonic signature that they were reluctant to change.\n\n===1960s and 1970s===\nIn a BBC white paper published in January 1963, the authors explored two-channel stereophony, and remarked that it was at a disadvantage compared with multi-channel stereophony that was already available in cinemas in that \"the full intended effects is apparent only to observers located within in a restricted area in front of the loudspeakers\". The authors expressed reservations about dispersion and directionality in 2-channel systems, noting that the \"face-to-face listening arrangement\" was not able to give an acceptable presentation for a centrally-located observer in a domestic setting.<ref name=bbcL053>[http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/reports/1963-01.pdf \"The Influence of Loudspeaker Directivity and Orientation on the Effective Audience Area in Two-Channel Stereophonic Reproduction\"], BBC Engineering Division, January 1963.</ref> The paper concluded: <blockquote>The achievement of suitable directional characteristics within the aesthetic and economic limitations applying to domestic equipment will however require a much greater research effort than either the corporation or the radio industry have so far been able to devote to the subject.<ref name=bbcL053/></blockquote>\n\nTo complement its larger two-way monitors for studio use, the BBC developed a small speaker for near-field monitoring of the frequency range from 400&nbsp;Hz to about 20&nbsp;kHz for its outside broadcasting monitoring. The principal constraints were space and situations where using headphones is unsatisfactory, such as in mobile broadcasting vans. Based on scaling tests done in 1968, and detailed audio work against the LS5/8 \u2013 a large \"Grade I monitor\" already in use at the time \u2013 and with live sources, the BBC Research Department developed the LS3/5, which became the famous [[LS3/5A]] that was used from 1975 to much of the 1990s and beyond by the BBC and audiophiles alike.<ref name=hfa1979bbchomeservice>Prakel, David (August 1979).

''Stereophile'' (Vol.30 No.4).</ref>\n\nIn the late 1960s JBL introduced two monitors which helped secure them pre-eminence in the industry. The 4320 was a direct competitor to the Altec 604 but was a more accurate and powerful speaker and it quickly made inroads against the industry standard. However, it was the more compact 4310 that revolutionized monitoring by introducing the idea of close or \"nearfield\" monitoring. (The sound field very close to a sound source is called the \"near-field.\" By \"very close\" is meant in the predominantly direct, rather than reflected, sound field. A near-field speaker is a compact studio monitor designed for listening at close distances ({{convert|3|to|5|ft|1}}), so, in theory, the effects of poor room acoustics are greatly reduced.)\n\nThe 4310 was small enough to be placed on the recording console and listened to from much closer distances than the traditional large wall-(or \"soffit\") mounted main monitors. As a result, studio-acoustic problems were minimized. Smaller studios found the 4310 ideal and that monitor and its successor, the 4311, became studio fixtures throughout the 1970s. Ironically, the 4310 had been designed to replicate the sonic idiosyncrasies of the Altec 604 but in a smaller package to cater for the technical needs of the time.\n\nThe 4311 was so popular with professionals that JBL introduced a domestic version for the burgeoning home-audio market. This speaker, the JBL L-100, (or \"Century\") was a massive success and became the biggest-selling hi-fi speaker ever within a few years. By 1975, JBL overtook Altec as the monitor of choice for most studios. The major studios continued to use huge designs mounted on the wall which were able to produce prodigious SPL's and amounts of bass.\n\nThis trend reached its zenith with [[The Who]]'s use of a dozen JBL 4350 monitors, each capable of 125&nbsp;dB and containing two fifteen-inch woofers and a twelve-inch mid-bass driver. Most studios, however, also used more modest monitoring devices to check how recordings would sound through car speakers and cheap home systems. A favourite \"grot-box\" monitor employed in this way was the Auratone 5C, a crude single-driver device that gave a reasonable facsimile of typical lo-fi sound.\n\nHowever, a backlash against the behemoth monitor was soon to take place. With the advent of [[Punk rock|punk]], [[New wave music|new wave]], [[Independent music|indie]], and [[Lo-fi music|lo-fi]], a reaction to high-tech recording and large corporate-style studios set in and do-it-yourself recording methods became the vogue. Smaller, less expensive, recording studios needed smaller, less expensive monitors and the [[Yamaha NS-10]], a design introduced in 1978 ironically for the home audio market, became the monitor of choice for many studios in the 1980s.<ref name=200809SOS>Phil Ward, [http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/sep08/articles/yamahans10.htm \"The Yamaha NS10 Story\"].

The larger studios still had large soffit-mounted main monitors but producers and engineers spent most of their time working with near-fields. Common large monitors of the time were Eastlake / Westlake monitors with twin 15\" bass units, a wooden midrange horn and a horn-loaded tweeter. The UREI 813 was also popular. Based on the almost ageless Altec 604 with a Time-Align passive crossover network developed by [[Ed Long (audio engineer)|Ed Long]], it included delay circuitry to align the acoustic centers of the low and high-frequency components. [[Fostex]] \"Laboratory Series\" monitors were used in a few high-end studios, but with increasing costs of manufacture, they became rare. The once dominant JBL fell gradually into disfavour.\n\nOne of the most striking trends was the growth of soft-dome monitors. These operated without horn-loaded drivers. Horns, while having advantages in transient response and efficiency, tend to be hard to listen to over long periods. The lack of distortion of high-end dome midrange & tweeters made them easy to work with all day (and night). Typical soft-dome systems were made by Roger Quested, ATC, Neil Grant and PMC and were actively driven by racks of active crossovers and amplifiers. Other monitor and studio designers like Tom Hidley, Phil Newall and Sam Toyoshima continued research into the speaker/room interface and led developments in room design, trapping, absorption and diffusion to create a consistent and neutral monitoring environment.\n\n===2000s===\n[[File:Bruce Gil in studio.png|thumb|[[Bruce Gil]] in a mastering studio (a near-field studio monitor can be seen on the left.]]\nThe main post-NS-10 trend has been the almost universal acceptance of powered monitors where the speaker enclosure contains the driving amplifiers. Passive monitors require outboard power amplifiers to drive them as well as speaker wire to connect them. Powered monitors, by contrast, are comparatively more convenient and streamlined single units, which in addition, marketeers claim a number of technical advantages. The interface between speaker and amplifier can be optimized, possibly offering greater control and precision, and advances in amplifier design have reduced the size and weight of the electronics significantly. The result has been that passive monitors have become far less common than powered monitors in project and home studios.\n\nIn the 2000s, there was a trend to focus on \"translation\". Engineers tended to choose monitors less for their accuracy than for their ability to \"translate\" \u2013 to make recordings sound good on a variety of playback systems, from stock car radios and standard [[boom box]]es to esoteric audiophile systems. As the mix engineer [[Chris Lord-Alge]] has noted:\n\n:Ninety-five percent of people listen to music in their car or on a cheap home stereo; 5 percent may have better systems; and maybe 1 percent have a $20,000 stereo. So if it doesn\u2019t sound good on something small, what\u2019s the point? You can mix in front of these huge, beautiful, pristine, $10,000 powered monitors all you want. But no one else has these monitors, so you\u2019re more likely to end up with a translation problem.\"<ref>Knave, Brian (1 June 2001) [http://emusician.com/speakers/emusic_good_references/ \"Good References\"], ''emusician''.</ref>\n\nBut it is uncertain just what tools aid translation. Some producers argue that accuracy is still the best guarantee. If a producer or audio engineer is listening to recorded tracks and mixing tracks using a \"flattering\" monitor speaker, she may miss subtle problems in the mic'ing or recording quality that a more precise monitor would expose. Other producers feel that monitors should mimic home audio and car speakers, as this is what most consumers listen to music on. Still more believe that monitors need to be relentlessly unflattering, so that the producer and engineer must work hard to make recordings sound good.\n\n==Comparison with hi-fi speakers==\n[[File:Ls3-5a by Spendor.jpg|thumb|Late model (c.1998) BBC LS3/5A manufactured under license by Spendor]]\nNo speaker, monitor or [[hi-fi]] sound system, regardless of the design principle or cost, has a completely flat frequency response; all speakers color the sound to some degree. Monitor speakers are assumed to be as free as possible from [[Loudspeaker measurement#Colouration analysis|coloration]]. While no rigid distinction exists between consumer speakers and studio monitors, manufacturers more and more accent the difference in their marketing material. Generally, studio monitors are physically robust, to cope with the high volumes and physical knocks that may happen in the studio, and are used for listening at shorter distances (e.g., near field) than hi-fi speakers, though nothing precludes them from being used in a home-sized environment. In one prominent recording magazine, ''[[Sound on Sound]]'', the number of self-amplified (active) studio monitor reviews significantly outweighs the number of passive monitor reviews over the past two decades indicating that studio monitors are predominantly self-amplified, although not exclusively so.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=review search term \"Monitor\" |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/search?url=%2Fsearch&Summary=Yes&Keyword=Monitors&Year=+&Month=+&Words=All&Summary=Yes&Section=7&Subject=42&ShowResults=yes|work=Sound On Sound|date=1994\u20132016}}</ref>  Hi-fi speakers usually require external amplification.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nMonitors are used by almost all professional producers and audio engineers.

Among [[audio engineer]]s, the term ''monitor'' implies that the speaker is designed to produce relatively flat (linear) [[phase response|phase]] and [[frequency response]]s. In other words, it exhibits minimal emphasis or de-emphasis of particular frequencies, the loudspeaker gives an accurate reproduction of the tonal qualities of the source audio (\"uncolored\" or \"transparent\" are synonyms), and there will be no relative [[absolute phase|phase]] shift of particular frequencies\u2014meaning no distortion in sound-stage perspective for stereo recordings.\n\nBeyond stereo sound-stage requirements, a linear phase response helps [[impulse response]] remain true to source without encountering \"smearing\". An unqualified reference to a ''monitor'' often refers to a ''near-field'' (compact or close-field) design. This is a speaker small enough to sit on a stand or desk in proximity to the listener, so that most of the sound that the listener hears is coming directly from the speaker, rather than reflecting off of walls and ceilings (and thus picking up coloration and reverberation from the room). Monitor speakers may include more than one type of driver (e.g., a [[tweeter]] and a [[woofer]]) or, for monitoring low-frequency sounds, such as [[bass drum]], additional [[subwoofer]] cabinets may be used.\n\nThere are studio monitors designed for mid-field or far-field use as well. These tend to be used in film scoring environments, where simulation of larger sized areas like theaters is important.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.recordingbase.com/near-field-vs-far-field/|title=Near Field Vs Far Field Studio Monitors [Ultimate Guide]|last=Roy|first=Gautam|date=2018-08-03|website=Recording Base|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-18}}</ref>\n\nAlso, studio monitors are made in a more physically robust manner than home hi-fi loudspeakers; whereas home hi-fi loudspeakers often only have to reproduce [[Dynamic range compression|compressed]] commercial recordings, studio monitors have to cope with the high volumes and sudden sound bursts that may happen in the studio when playing back [[Audio mastering|unmastered]] mixes.\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:Quested HM412 main monitor, Studio 9000, PatchWerk Recording Studios, 2007.jpg|thumb|Quested HM412 main monitor, Studio 9000, PatchWerk Recording Studios]]\n[[File:Passive studio monitor Amphion.jpg|thumb|A near-field passive studio monitor by [[Amphion Loudspeakers]]]]\nBroadcasting and recording organisations employ audio engineers who use loudspeakers to assess the aesthetic merits of the programme and to tailor the balance by [[audio mixing (recorded music)|audio mixing]] and [[audio mastering|mastering]] to achieve the desired end result. Loudspeakers are also required at various points in the audio processing chain to enable engineers to ensure that the programme is reasonably free from technical defects, such as audible distortion or background noise.<ref name=1958BBCpaper>[http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/reports/1958-31.pdf \"The Development of High-Quality Monitoring Loudspeakers: A Review of Progress\"] (Expanded Version of I.EoE.

Report No. L-041 (1958/31), The British Broadcasting Corporation</ref>\n\nThe engineer may mix programming that will sound pleasing on the widest range of playback systems used by regular listeners (i.e. [[high-end audio]], low-quality radios in [[clock radio]]s and \"[[boom box]]es\", in club [[PA system]]s, in a car stereo or a home stereo). While some broadcasters like the BBC generally believe in using monitors of \"the highest practicable standard of performance\",{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} some audio engineers argue that monitoring should be carried out with loudspeakers of mediocre technical quality to be representative of the regular systems [[end-user]]s are likely to be listening with; or that some technical defects are apparent only with high-grade reproducing equipment and therefore can be ignored.<ref name=1958BBCpaper/> However, as a public broadcaster dealing with a lot of live material, the BBC's criteria for studio monitors view is that they should be \"as free as possible from avoidable defects\". It is argued that real life low-grade sound systems are so different that it would be impossible to compensate for the characteristics of every type of system available; technical faults must not be apparent to even a minority of listeners while remaining undetected by the operating staff. It is further argued that, because of technical progress in the science of sound transmission, equipment in the studio originating the programme should have a higher standard of performance than the equipment employed in reproducing it, since the former has a longer life.<ref name=1958BBCpaper/>\n\nIn fact, most [[professional audio]] production studios have several sets of monitors spanning the range of playback systems in the market. This may include a sampling of large, expensive speakers as may be used in movie theatres, hi-fi style speakers, car speakers, portable music systems, PC speakers and consumer-grade headphones.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nAmplification: Studio monitors may be \"[[powered speakers|active]]\" (including one or more internal power amplifier(s)), or passive (these require an external [[Audio amplifier|power amplifier]]). Active models are usually [[Bi-amping|bi-amplified]], which means that the input sound signal is divided into two parts by an [[Audio crossover#Active crossovers|active crossover]] for low and high frequency components. Both parts are amplified using separate low- and high-frequency amplifiers, and then the low-frequency part is routed to a [[woofer]] and the high-frequency part is routed to a [[tweeter]] or [[Horn speaker|horn]]. Bi-amplification is done so that a cleaner overall sound reproduction can be obtained, since signals are easier to process before power amplification. Consumer loudspeakers may or may not have these various design goals.\n\n==History==\n===1920s and 1930s===\nIn the early years of the recording industry in the 1920s and 1930s, studio monitors were used primarily to check for noise interference and obvious technical problems rather than for making artistic evaluations of the performance and recording. Musicians were recorded live and the producer judged the performance on this basis, relying on simple tried-and-true microphone techniques to ensure that it had been adequately captured; playback through monitors was used simply to check that no obvious technical flaws had spoiled the original recording.\n\nAs a result, early monitors tended to be basic loudspeaker cabinets. The state-of-the-art loudspeakers of the era were massive [[horn loudspeaker|horn-loaded]] systems which were mostly used in cinemas. High-end loudspeaker design grew out of the demands of the motion picture industry and most of the early loudspeaker pioneers worked in Los Angeles where they attempted to solve the problems of cinema sound. [[Stereophonic sound]] was in its infancy, having been pioneered in Britain by an engineer who worked for [[EMI]]. Designing monitors for recording studios was not a major priority.\n\n===1940s and 1950s===\nThe first high-quality loudspeaker developed expressly as a studio monitor was the [[Altec Lansing Duplex]] 604 in 1944. This innovative driver has historically been regarded as growing out of the work of [[James Bullough Lansing]] who had previously supplied the drivers for the Shearer Horn in 1936, a speaker that had rapidly become the industry standard in motion-picture sound. He had also designed the smaller Iconic and this was widely employed at the time as a motion-picture studio monitor. The 604 was a relatively compact [[coaxial]] design and within a few years it became the industry standard in the United States, a position it maintained in its various incarnations (the 604 went through eleven model-changes) over the next 25 years. It was common in US studios throughout the 1950s and 60s and remained in continuous production until 1998.\n\n[[File:DM Recording Studio.jpg|thumb|Siemens Recording Studio ca. 1956 as seen in the Deutsches Museum in Munich Germany.]]\nIn the UK, Tannoy introduced its own coaxial design, the Dual Concentric, and this assumed the same reference role in Europe as the Altec 604 held in the US. The British Broadcasting Corporation researchers conducted evaluations on as many speakers as they could obtain in around 1948, but found commercial loudspeaker makers had little to offer that met their requirements. The BBC needed speakers that worked well with program material within real professional and domestic settings environments, and not just fulfil technical measurements such as frequency-response, distortion, monitors in anechoic chambers. Above all, the BBC required monitors to sound balanced, be neutral in tone, and lack colouration.<ref>Seydor, Paul. [https://store.theabsolutesound.com/files/images/The%20BBC%20Monitor.pdf \"The BBC Monitor\"]. ''The Absolute Sound\u2019s Illustrated History of High-End Audio'' p.306</ref> Monitor usage in the industry was highly conservative, with almost monopolistic reliance on industry \"standards\", in spite of the sonic failings of these aging designs. The Altec 604 had a notoriously ragged [[frequency response]] but almost all U.S studios continued to use it because virtually every producer and engineer knew its sound intimately and were practiced at listening through its sonic limitations.\n\nRecording through unfamiliar monitors, no matter how technically advanced, was hazardous because engineers unfamiliar with their sonic signatures could make poor production decisions and it was financially unviable to give production staff expensive studio time to familiarize themselves with new monitors. As a result, pretty well every U.S studio had a set of 604's and every European studio a Tannoy Dual Concentric or two. However, in 1959, at the height of its industry dominance, Altec made the mistake of replacing the 604 with the 605A Duplex, a design widely regarded as inferior to its predecessor. There was a backlash from some record companies and studios and this allowed Altec's competitor, JBL (a company originally started by 604 designer James B. Lansing), to make inroads into the pro monitor market.\n\n[[Capitol Records]] replaced their Altecs with JBL D50 Monitors and a few years later their UK affiliate, [[EMI]], also made the move to JBL's. Although Altec re-introduced the 604 as the \"E\" version Super Duplex in response to the criticism, they now had a major industry rival to contend with. Over the next decade most of the developments in studio monitor design originated from JBL.\n\nAs the public broadcaster in the UK, the BBC had the determinant role in defining industry standards. Its [[BBC Research & Development|renowned research departments]] invested considerable resources in determining studio monitor suited to their different broadcasting needs, and also created their own models from first principles. A 1958 research paper identified the sound goal, in a [[monaural]] system:<blockquote>It is assumed that the ideal to be aimed at in the design of a sound reproducing system is realism, i.e. that the listener should be able to imagine himself to be in the presence of the original source of sound.\n\nThere is, of course, scope for legitimate experiment in the processing of the reproduced signals in an endeavour to improve on nature, however, realism, or as near an approach to it as may be possible, ought surely to be regarded as the normal condition and avoidable departures from this state, while justified upon occasion, should not be allowed to become a permanent feature of the system.<ref name=1958BBCpaper/></blockquote>\nIn designing a loudspeaker, the BBC established the compromise that had to be established between size, weight and cost considerations. Two-way designs were preferred due to the inherently simpler crossover network, but were subject to the limitations of speaker driver technology at the time &ndash; there were few high-frequency units available at the time that functioned down to 1.5&nbsp;kHz, meaning that the woofer must operate in a predictable manner up to about 2&nbsp;kHz.<ref name=1967BBCpaper>[http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/reports/1967-57.pdf \"The Design of the Studio Monitoring Loudspeakers Types LS5/5 and LS5/6\"]. Report No. PH13 (1967/57), November 1967, The British Broadcasting Corporation</ref> The BBC developed a two-way studio monitor in 1959, the LS5/1, using a 58mm [[Celestion]] tweeter and 380mm [[Goodmans Industries|Goodmans]] bass unit, but continually had problems with consistency of the bass units. The successful testing of a 305mm bass cone made with new thermoplastics led to development and deployment of the LS5/5 and LS5/6 monitors that occupied only 60% volume of its predecessor.<ref name=1967BBCpaper/>\n\nAs recording became less and less \"live\" and [[Multitrack recording|multi-tracking]] and [[overdubbing]] became the norm, the studio monitor became far more crucial to the recording process. When there was no original performance outside what existed on the tape, the monitor became the touchstone of all engineering and production decisions. As a result, accuracy and transparency became paramount and the conservatism evident in the retention of the 604 as the standard for over twenty years began to give way to fresh technological development. Despite this, the 604 continued to be widely used - mainly because many engineers and producers were so familiar with their sonic signature that they were reluctant to change.\n\n===1960s and 1970s===\nIn a BBC white paper published in January 1963, the authors explored two-channel stereophony, and remarked that it was at a disadvantage compared with multi-channel stereophony that was already available in cinemas in that \"the full intended effects is apparent only to observers located within in a restricted area in front of the loudspeakers\". The authors expressed reservations about dispersion and directionality in 2-channel systems, noting that the \"face-to-face listening arrangement\" was not able to give an acceptable presentation for a centrally-located observer in a domestic setting.<ref name=bbcL053>[http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/reports/1963-01.pdf \"The Influence of Loudspeaker Directivity and Orientation on the Effective Audience Area in Two-Channel Stereophonic Reproduction\"], BBC Engineering Division, January 1963.</ref> The paper concluded: <blockquote>The achievement of suitable directional characteristics within the aesthetic and economic limitations applying to domestic equipment will however require a much greater research effort than either the corporation or the radio industry have so far been able to devote to the subject.<ref name=bbcL053/></blockquote>\n\nTo complement its larger two-way monitors for studio use, the BBC developed a small speaker for near-field monitoring of the frequency range from 400&nbsp;Hz to about 20&nbsp;kHz for its outside broadcasting monitoring. The principal constraints were space and situations where using headphones is unsatisfactory, such as in mobile broadcasting vans. Based on scaling tests done in 1968, and detailed audio work against the LS5/8 \u2013 a large \"Grade I monitor\" already in use at the time \u2013 and with live sources, the BBC Research Department developed the LS3/5, which became the famous [[LS3/5A]] that was used from 1975 to much of the 1990s and beyond by the BBC and audiophiles alike.<ref name=hfa1979bbchomeservice>Prakel, David (August 1979).

''Stereophile'' (Vol.30 No.4).</ref>\n\nIn the late 1960s JBL introduced two monitors which helped secure them pre-eminence in the industry. The 4320 was a direct competitor to the Altec 604 but was a more accurate and powerful speaker and it quickly made inroads against the industry standard. However, it was the more compact 4310 that revolutionized monitoring by introducing the idea of close or \"nearfield\" monitoring. (The sound field very close to a sound source is called the \"near-field.\" By \"very close\" is meant in the predominantly direct, rather than reflected, sound field. A near-field speaker is a compact studio monitor designed for listening at close distances ({{convert|3|to|5|ft|1}}), so, in theory, the effects of poor room acoustics are greatly reduced.)\n\nThe 4310 was small enough to be placed on the recording console and listened to from much closer distances than the traditional large wall-(or \"soffit\") mounted main monitors. As a result, studio-acoustic problems were minimized. Smaller studios found the 4310 ideal and that monitor and its successor, the 4311, became studio fixtures throughout the 1970s. Ironically, the 4310 had been designed to replicate the sonic idiosyncrasies of the Altec 604 but in a smaller package to cater for the technical needs of the time.\n\nThe 4311 was so popular with professionals that JBL introduced a domestic version for the burgeoning home-audio market. This speaker, the JBL L-100, (or \"Century\") was a massive success and became the biggest-selling hi-fi speaker ever within a few years. By 1975, JBL overtook Altec as the monitor of choice for most studios. The major studios continued to use huge designs mounted on the wall which were able to produce prodigious SPL's and amounts of bass.\n\nThis trend reached its zenith with [[The Who]]'s use of a dozen JBL 4350 monitors, each capable of 125&nbsp;dB and containing two fifteen-inch woofers and a twelve-inch mid-bass driver. Most studios, however, also used more modest monitoring devices to check how recordings would sound through car speakers and cheap home systems. A favourite \"grot-box\" monitor employed in this way was the Auratone 5C, a crude single-driver device that gave a reasonable facsimile of typical lo-fi sound.\n\nHowever, a backlash against the behemoth monitor was soon to take place. With the advent of [[Punk rock|punk]], [[New wave music|new wave]], [[Independent music|indie]], and [[Lo-fi music|lo-fi]], a reaction to high-tech recording and large corporate-style studios set in and do-it-yourself recording methods became the vogue. Smaller, less expensive, recording studios needed smaller, less expensive monitors and the [[Yamaha NS-10]], a design introduced in 1978 ironically for the home audio market, became the monitor of choice for many studios in the 1980s.<ref name=200809SOS>Phil Ward, [http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/sep08/articles/yamahans10.htm \"The Yamaha NS10 Story\"].

The larger studios still had large soffit-mounted main monitors but producers and engineers spent most of their time working with near-fields. Common large monitors of the time were Eastlake / Westlake monitors with twin 15\" bass units, a wooden midrange horn and a horn-loaded tweeter. The UREI 813 was also popular. Based on the almost ageless Altec 604 with a Time-Align passive crossover network developed by [[Ed Long (audio engineer)|Ed Long]], it included delay circuitry to align the acoustic centers of the low and high-frequency components. [[Fostex]] \"Laboratory Series\" monitors were used in a few high-end studios, but with increasing costs of manufacture, they became rare. The once dominant JBL fell gradually into disfavour.\n\nOne of the most striking trends was the growth of soft-dome monitors. These operated without horn-loaded drivers. Horns, while having advantages in transient response and efficiency, tend to be hard to listen to over long periods. The lack of distortion of high-end dome midrange & tweeters made them easy to work with all day (and night). Typical soft-dome systems were made by Roger Quested, ATC, Neil Grant and PMC and were actively driven by racks of active crossovers and amplifiers. Other monitor and studio designers like Tom Hidley, Phil Newall and Sam Toyoshima continued research into the speaker/room interface and led developments in room design, trapping, absorption and diffusion to create a consistent and neutral monitoring environment.\n\n===2000s===\n[[File:Bruce Gil in studio.png|thumb|[[Bruce Gil]] in a mastering studio (a near-field studio monitor can be seen on the left.]]\nThe main post-NS-10 trend has been the almost universal acceptance of powered monitors where the speaker enclosure contains the driving amplifiers. Passive monitors require outboard power amplifiers to drive them as well as speaker wire to connect them. Powered monitors, by contrast, are comparatively more convenient and streamlined single units, which in addition, marketeers claim a number of technical advantages. The interface between speaker and amplifier can be optimized, possibly offering greater control and precision, and advances in amplifier design have reduced the size and weight of the electronics significantly. The result has been that passive monitors have become far less common than powered monitors in project and home studios.\n\nIn the 2000s, there was a trend to focus on \"translation\". Engineers tended to choose monitors less for their accuracy than for their ability to \"translate\" \u2013 to make recordings sound good on a variety of playback systems, from stock car radios and standard [[boom box]]es to esoteric audiophile systems. As the mix engineer [[Chris Lord-Alge]] has noted:\n\n:Ninety-five percent of people listen to music in their car or on a cheap home stereo; 5 percent may have better systems; and maybe 1 percent have a $20,000 stereo. So if it doesn\u2019t sound good on something small, what\u2019s the point? You can mix in front of these huge, beautiful, pristine, $10,000 powered monitors all you want. But no one else has these monitors, so you\u2019re more likely to end up with a translation problem.\"<ref>Knave, Brian (1 June 2001) [http://emusician.com/speakers/emusic_good_references/ \"Good References\"], ''emusician''.</ref>\n\nBut it is uncertain just what tools aid translation. Some producers argue that accuracy is still the best guarantee. If a producer or audio engineer is listening to recorded tracks and mixing tracks using a \"flattering\" monitor speaker, she may miss subtle problems in the mic'ing or recording quality that a more precise monitor would expose. Other producers feel that monitors should mimic home audio and car speakers, as this is what most consumers listen to music on. Still more believe that monitors need to be relentlessly unflattering, so that the producer and engineer must work hard to make recordings sound good.\n\n==Comparison with hi-fi speakers==\n[[File:Ls3-5a by Spendor.jpg|thumb|Late model (c.1998) BBC LS3/5A manufactured under license by Spendor]]\nNo speaker, monitor or [[hi-fi]] sound system, regardless of the design principle or cost, has a completely flat frequency response; all speakers color the sound to some degree. Monitor speakers are assumed to be as free as possible from [[Loudspeaker measurement#Colouration analysis|coloration]]. While no rigid distinction exists between consumer speakers and studio monitors, manufacturers more and more accent the difference in their marketing material. Generally, studio monitors are physically robust, to cope with the high volumes and physical knocks that may happen in the studio, and are used for listening at shorter distances (e.g., near field) than hi-fi speakers, though nothing precludes them from being used in a home-sized environment. In one prominent recording magazine, ''[[Sound on Sound]]'', the number of self-amplified (active) studio monitor reviews significantly outweighs the number of passive monitor reviews over the past two decades indicating that studio monitors are predominantly self-amplified, although not exclusively so.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=review search term \"Monitor\" |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/search?url=%2Fsearch&Summary=Yes&Keyword=Monitors&Year=+&Month=+&Words=All&Summary=Yes&Section=7&Subject=42&ShowResults=yes|work=Sound On Sound|date=1994\u20132016}}</ref>  Hi-fi speakers usually require external amplification.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nMonitors are used by almost all professional producers and audio engineers.

genus ''[[Drosophila]]''.  All species are easily recognized by the white longitudinal stripes across the head and thorax. The genus is subdivided in two subgenera, based on the presence of an even (subgenus ''[[Zaprionus (subgenus)|Zaprionus]]'') or odd (subgenus ''[[Anaprionus]]'') number of white stripes. The species of the genus can be found in African and Southern Asia. One species, ''[[Zaprionus indianus]]'', has invaded the [[New World]].\n\n==Description==\nAll species in the genus ''Zaprionus'' are easily identified by the longitudinal white stripes bordered by black stripes running across the top of the head and thorax. Species of the subgenus ''Zaprionus'' have 4 or 6 white stripes while the species of the subgenus ''Anaprionus'' have 5 or 7 white stripes. The general body color varies across species from yellowish to dark brown. Several species of the subgenus ''Zaprionus'' have one or more stout and sometimes composite spines on the forelegs.<ref name=\"YassinZookeys\">Yassin A and David JR.
