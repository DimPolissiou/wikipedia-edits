It featured a French army under [[Maurice, comte de Saxe|Marshal Saxe]] and a combined [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713|British, Dutch, German and Austrian]] force led by [[Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine|Charles of Lorraine]], [[John Ligonier, 1st Earl Ligonier|John Ligonier]] and [[Karl August, Prince of Waldeck and Pyrmont|Prince Waldeck]]. The battle ended the 1746 campaign and the two armies went into winter quarters.  \n\nFrance was struggling to finance the war and opened bilateral peace negotiations with Britain at the [[Congress of Breda]] in August 1746. Rocoux was a tactical success that confirmed French control of the [[Austrian Netherlands]] but Saxe failed to achieve the decisive victory needed to end the war. \n\n==Background==\nWhen the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] began in 1740, Britain was still fighting the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] with [[Enlightenment_in_Spain|Spain]]; from 1739 to 1742, the main area of operations was in the [[Caribbean_Sea|Caribbean]]. British and Dutch troops initially fought as part of the army of [[Electorate_of_Hanover|Hanover]]; it was not until March 1744 that France formally declared war on Britain, while the [[Dutch Republic]] officially remained neutral until 1747.{{sfn|Scott|2015|pp=48\u201350}} \n\nFrench victory at [[Battle_of_Fontenoy|Fontenoy]] in April 1745 was followed by the capture of the key ports of [[Ostend]], [[Ghent]] and [[Nieuport]], while the [[Jacobite_rising_of_1745|1745 Jacobite Rising]] forced Britain to transfer troops to Scotland. In the first months of 1746, the French took [[Leuven|Louvain]], [[Brussels]] and [[Antwerp]]; bolstered by these successes, Foreign Minister [[Ren\u00e9_Louis_de_Voyer_de_Paulmy_d'Argenson|d'Argenson]] sent peace proposals to Britain.{{sfn|Lindsay|1957|p=210}}\n\nFrench battlefield victories in [[Flanders]] failed to achieve a decisive result, and the British hoped to retrieve their position. With the defeat of the Rising in April, [[John Ligonier, 1st Earl Ligonier|Earl Ligonier]] returned from Scotland to assume command of the Hanoverian and British troops.{{sfn|Wood|2004}} However, only British subsidies kept their allies in the war. Austria's priority was to regain [[Silesia]] from [[Kingdom_of_Prussia|Prussia]]; they acquired the [[Austrian Netherlands]] in 1713, only because neither the British or Dutch would allow the other to control it. The Dutch also wanted peace, since the fighting badly affected trade; these factors played an important role in the 1746 campaign that ended at Rocoux.{{sfn|Scott|2015|pp=58\u201360}}\n\n==The battle==\n{{Location map many|Belgium|caption = The Austrian Netherlands and Southern Dutch Republic; key locations 1746\u20131748|relief=yes|border = black| width = 250| float = left\n|label = Brussels |pos=left  |lat_deg=50|lat_min =51|lon_deg = 4|lon_min = 21\n|label4 = Antwerp |pos4=top|lat4_deg=51|lat4_min = 13|lon4_deg = 4|lon4_min = 24\n|label5=  Leuven  |pos5=left|lat5_deg=50|lat5_min = 40|lon5_deg = 4|lon5_min = 37\n|label6 = Liege   |pos6=right|lat6_deg=50|lat6_min =38 |lon6_deg = 5 |lon6_min = 34\n|label7 = Charleroi|pos7 = left| lat7_deg = 50 | lat7_min = 24 | lon7_deg = 4 | lon7_min = 26\n|label8 = Namur   |pos8 = right| lat8_deg = 50 | lat8_min = 28 | lon8_deg = 4| lon8_min = 52|\n|label9=Maastricht|pos9 = top|lat9_deg = 50 | lat9_min = 51 | lon9_deg = 5 | lon9_min = 41}}\nOften referred to as [[Flanders]], the [[Austrian Netherlands]] was a compact area 160 kilometres wide, the highest point only 100 metres above sea level, and dominated by canals and rivers.

It featured a French army under [[Maurice, comte de Saxe|Marshal Saxe]] and a combined [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713|British, Dutch, German and Austrian]] force led by [[Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine|Charles of Lorraine]], [[John Ligonier, 1st Earl Ligonier|John Ligonier]] and [[Karl August, Prince of Waldeck and Pyrmont|Prince Waldeck]]. The battle ended the 1746 campaign and the two armies went into winter quarters.  \n\nFrance was struggling to finance the war and opened bilateral peace negotiations with Britain at the [[Congress of Breda]] in August 1746. Rocoux was a tactical success that confirmed French control of the [[Austrian Netherlands]] but Saxe failed to achieve the decisive victory needed to end the war. \n\n==Background==\nWhen the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] began in 1740, Britain was still fighting the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] with [[Enlightenment_in_Spain|Spain]]; from 1739 to 1742, the main area of operations was in the [[Caribbean_Sea|Caribbean]]. British and Dutch troops initially fought as part of the army of [[Electorate_of_Hanover|Hanover]]; it was not until March 1744 that France formally declared war on Britain, while the [[Dutch Republic]] officially remained neutral until 1747.{{sfn|Scott|2015|pp=48-50}} \n\nFrench victory at [[Battle_of_Fontenoy|Fontenoy]] in April 1745 was followed by the capture of the key ports of [[Ostend]], [[Ghent]] and [[Nieuport]], while the [[Jacobite_rising_of_1745|1745 Jacobite Rising]] forced Britain to transfer troops to Scotland. In the first months of 1746, the French took [[Leuven|Louvain]], [[Brussels]] and [[Antwerp]]; bolstered by these successes, Foreign Minister [[Ren\u00e9_Louis_de_Voyer_de_Paulmy_d'Argenson|d'Argenson]] sent peace proposals to Britain.{{sfn|Lindsay|1957|p=210}}\n\nFrench battlefield victories in [[Flanders]] failed to achieve a decisive result, and the British hoped to retrieve their position. With the defeat of the Rising in April, [[John Ligonier, 1st Earl Ligonier|Earl Ligonier]] returned from Scotland to assume command of the Hanoverian and British troops.{{sfn|Wood|2004}} However, only British subsidies kept their allies in the war.
