{"title_page": "Baldwin\u2013Felts Detective Agency", "text_new": "The '''Baldwin\u2013Felts Detective Agency''' was a [[private detective]] agency in the [[United States]] from the early 1890s to 1937.  Members of the agency were central actors in the events that led to the [[Battle of Blair Mountain]] in 1921 and violent repression of [[labor union]] members as part of the [[Coal Wars]] in such places as the [[Pocahontas Coalfield]] region of [[West Virginia]], the [[Paint Creek-Cabin Creek strike of 1912]] in West Virginia, 1913-1914 [[Colorado Coalfield War]] (including the [[Ludlow Massacre]] in 1914), and the [[Battle of Matewan]] in 1920.\n\nThe agency was founded in the early 1890s by William Gibbony Baldwin as the Baldwin Detective Agency.\n\n== Formation ==\nBaldwin, the senior member of the firm, was a native of [[Tazewell County, Virginia]]. An avid reader of detective novels in his youth, Baldwin was a small storekeeper in his early days. He then studied [[dentistry]] but left that profession to become a detective. He began his career in 1884 with the Eureka Detective Agency in [[Charleston, West Virginia]]. After founding the Baldwin Detective Agency, he then moved to [[Roanoke, Virginia]], to oversee security operations in the [[Norfolk & Western Railway]]'s coalfield district. He was later appointed chief special agent, a position he held until his retirement, in 1930.\n\nThomas Lafayette Felts was a native of [[Galax, Virginia]], who was educated as a lawyer and was a member of the [[Virginia Bar Association]]. In 1900, he joined the Baldwin Detective Agency as a partner who could provide legal advice to the firm. In 1910, the name of the agency was changed to the Baldwin\u2013Felts Detective Agency, and its headquarters were in [[Bluefield, West Virginia]].\n \nOriginally, the company provided investigative services to railroads for [[train robbery|train robberies]] and other crimes.<ref>Velke III, John, ''The True Story of the Baldwin\u2013Felts Detective Agency'', {{ISBN|0-9664336-1-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-9664336-1-6}} (2004)</ref> Little is known about this chapter in the history of Baldwin\u2013Felts, but it is known that the company provided guards for railway and mine payrolls and accompanied coal trains into the coalfields. The company investigated train wrecks, robberies, and thefts. By the early 1900s, the agency had also undertaken detective work for both federal and state government agencies.\n\n==National prominence==\nThe agency rose to national prominence with the pursuit and capture of the fugitive of [[Floyd Allen]] and members of his family who were involved in a courtroom shootout in [[Carroll County, Virginia|Carroll County]], [[Hillsville, Virginia|Hillsville]], [[Virginia]]. Five people died and seven were wounded, including Commonwealth Attorney William Foster,  Sheriff Lewis F. Webb, and Judge Thornton Lemmon Massie. The event was reported nationally from March 13 to April 15, 1912.\n\nAt the time, Virginia law required the local sheriff to head the criminal investigation and pursue those suspected of committing the killings. No provision for succession after his death had been provided for in the law, and his deputies lost all their legal powers until the next election. Faced with the dilemma, Virginia Governor [[William Hodges Mann]] sent a telegram to the Baldwin\u2013Felts agency to apprehend the fugitives:\n\n<blockquote>Send troops to the County of Carroll at once. Mob violence, the court. Commonwealth's Attorney, Sheriff, some jurors and others shot on the conviction of Floyd Allen for a felony. Sheriff and Commonwealth's Attorney dead, court serious. Look after this now.<ref>Williamson, Seth, ''[http://www.theroanoker.com/favoritearticles/hillsvillemassacre.cfm.

The wounded Allen was arrested at his hotel by Felts personally. Most of the Allens and their relations were arrested by a [[posse comitatus (common law)|posse]] of Baldwin\u2013Felts detectives, who chased down the fugitives in a relentless search that was carried out regardless of weather conditions. Nevertheless, two of the men (Sidna Allen and Wesley Edwards) escaped to [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]], [[Iowa]]. An informant (Maude Iroller) tipped the agency as to the men's whereabouts, and the fugitives were arrested and brought back to Carroll County before the end of the year.\n\n==Strike breakers==\nBy the 1910s, railroad crimes and associated banditry had decreased in the United States. Therefore, Baldwin\u2013Felts began hiring out their detectives as private security forces for mining companies and so the company is remembered for its violent confrontations with the [[labor union]]s. \n\nBaldwin\u2013Felts was allowed to operate like that because public law enforcement and the maintenance of order in labor disputes were often left to company owners. Therefore, they could employ the likes of Baldwin\u2013Felts to suppress strikes; collect intelligence on unions; prevent labor organizers from entering company grounds; and evict the families of union members living in company-owned housing who had gone on strike or failed to pay rent.\n\nIn 1912, Baldwin\u2013Felts agents were soon employed strikebreaking in West Virginia at the Pocohantas Coal Fields and the Paint Creek-Cabin Creek. Their thuggish behaviour and their known propensity for violence led the former [[List of Attorneys General of West Virginia|Attorney General of West Virginia]], [[Howard B. Lee]], to remark in his 1969 book that Baldwin and Felt were the \"two most feared and hated men in the mountains.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Lee|first= Howard B.|title=Bloodletting in Appalachia: The Story of West Virginia's Four Major Mine Wars and Other Thrilling Incidents Of Its Coal Fields|url=https://archive.org/details/chromosome61stfi00robi|url-access=registration|publisher= Morgantown: West Virginia University Press|year=1969|page= [https://archive.org/details/chromosome61stfi00robi/page/53 53]}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1913 and 1914, Baldwin\u2013Felts agents had moved west and become involved in another coal field struggle in [[Las Animas County]], Colorado. Agency detectives were employed in squads to harass striking workers. They used an [[armored car (military)|armored car]] with a mounted [[machine gun]] (it was called the ''Death Special'' by the miners). The events culminated in the violent confrontation known as the [[Ludlow Massacre]], when the [[Colorado National Guard]] used machine guns to kill 21 people, including miners' wives and children.\n\n=== Battle of Matewan ===\n{{Main|Battle of Matewan}}\nThe most infamous striking breaking action undertaken by the Baldwin-Felts was in [[Matewan, West Virginia]]. A confrontation between locals and agents resulted in the deaths of two miners and Matewan's Mayor as well as seven Baldwin-Felts detectives including Thomas Felts' brothers, Albert and Lee.\n\nOn May 19, 1920, 12 Baldwin-Felts agents, including Lee Felts, arrived in [[Matewan, West Virginia]] and met with Albert Felts, who was already in the area. Albert and Lee were the brothers of Thomas Felts, the co-owner and director of the agency. Albert had already been in the area and had tried to bribe Mayor Testerman with $500 to place machine guns on roofs in the town; Testerman refused.{{sfn|Savage|1990|p=16}} That afternoon Albert and Lee along with 11 other men set out to the Stone Mountain Coal Co. property. The first family they evicted was a woman and her children; the woman's husband was not home at the time. They forced them out at gunpoint and threw their belongings in the road under a light but steady rain. The miners who saw it were furious, and sent word to town.{{sfn|Savage|1990|pp=20\u201322}}\n\nAs the agents walked to the train station to leave town, Police Chief [[Sid Hatfield]] and a group of deputized miners confronted them and told them they were under arrest. Albert Felts replied that in fact he had a warrant for Hatfield's arrest.{{sfn|Savage|1990|p=21}} Testerman was alerted, and he ran out into the street after a miner shouted that Sid had been arrested. Hatfield backed into the store and Testerman asked to see the warrant. After reviewing it, the mayor exclaimed, \"This is a bogus warrant.\" With these words, a gunfight erupted and Hatfield shot Albert Felts. Testerman and Albert and Lee Felts were among the ten men killed (three from the town and seven from the agency).{{sfn|Savage|1990|p=21}} Albert and Lee Felts were buried in [[Galax, Virginia]] in what is now the Felts Memorial Cemetery. Their funeral was attended by over 3,000 people.<ref>Velke III, John, ''The True Story of the Baldwin\u2013Felts Detective Agency'', {{ISBN|0-9664336-1-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-9664336-1-6}} (2004)</ref>\n\nThis gunfight became known as the Matewan Massacre, and its symbolic significance was enormous for the miners. The seemingly invincible Baldwin-Felts had been beaten.{{sfn|Savage|1990|p=26}} Sid Hatfield became an immediate legend and hero to the union miners, and a symbol of hope that the oppression of coal operators and their hired guns could be overthrown.{{sfn|Savage|1990|p=28}} Throughout the summer and into the fall of 1920 the union gained strength in [[Mingo County, West Virginia|Mingo County]], as did the resistance of the coal operators. Low-intensity warfare was waged up and down the [[Tug Fork|Tug River]]. In late June state police under the command of Captain Brockus raided the Lick Creek tent colony near Williamson. Miners were said to have fired on Brockus and Martin's men from the colony, and in response the state police shot and arrested miners, ripped the canvas tents to shreds and scattered the mining families' belongings.{{sfn|Savage|1990|p=60}} Both sides were bolstering their arms, and Sid Hatfield continued to be a problem, especially when he converted Testerman's jewelry store into a gun shop.{{sfn|Savage|1990|p=50}}\n\nOn January 26, 1921, the trial of Hatfield for killing Albert Felts began. It was in the national spotlight and brought much attention to the miners' cause. Hatfield's stature and mythical status grew as the trial proceeded. He posed and talked to reporters, fanning the flames of his own legend. All men were acquitted in the end, but overall the union was facing significant setbacks.{{sfn|Shogan|2004|p=98}} Eighty percent of mines had reopened with the importation of replacements and the signing of [[yellow-dog contracts]] by ex-strikers returning to the mines.{{sfn|Shogan|2004|p=81}} In mid-May 1921 union miners launched a full-scale assault on non-union mines. In a short time the conflict had consumed the entire Tug River Valley. This \"Three Days Battle\" was finally ended by a flag of truce and the implementation of martial law.{{sfn|Savage|1990|p=53}} From the beginning, the miners perceived the enforcement of martial law as one-sided.{{sfn|Savage|1990|p=57}} Hundreds of miners were arrested; the smallest of infractions could mean imprisonment, while those on the side of \"law and order\" were seen as immune.{{sfn|Savage|1990|p=58}} The miners responded with guerrilla tactics and violence.{{sfn|Savage|1990|p=58}}\n\nIn the midst of this tense situation, Hatfield traveled to [[McDowell County, West Virginia|McDowell County]] on 1 August 1921 to stand trial on charges of dynamiting a [[Tipple|coal tipple]]. Along with him traveled a good friend, Ed Chambers, and their wives.{{sfn|Shogan|2004|pp=154\u2013156}} As they walked up the courthouse stairs, unarmed and flanked by their wives, a group of Baldwin-Felts agents standing at the top of the stairs opened fire. Hatfield was killed instantly. Chambers was bullet-riddled and rolled to the bottom of the stairs. Despite Sally Chambers' protests, one of the agents ([[Charles Everett Lively]]) ran down the stairs and shot Chambers once more, point blank in the back of the head.{{sfn|Shogan|2004|pp=157\u2013158}} Hatfield's and Chambers' bodies were returned to Matewan, and word of the slayings spread through the mountains.\n\nThe miners were angry at the way Hatfield had been slain, and that it appeared the assassins would escape punishment.{{sfn|Savage|1990|p=73}} They began to pour out of the mountains and take up arms.\n\n== Final years & closure==\nBoth Baldwin and Felts were also involved in banking, and Baldwin later served as president and member of the board of directors of several banks. Felts was later elected to two terms as a Virginia state senator.\n\nBaldwin died in 1936, at 75; Felts died a year later, at 69. In 1937, four months before his death, Felts had formally dissolved the Baldwin\u2013Felts Detective Agency. By then, strikebreaking work had declined. State and federal legislation outlawing the use of private detectives for the purpose of spying on or harassing workers, along with shifting public opinion, had made such detectives less useful to management in labor disputes.\n\nAfter the agency closed its doors, most of the company's files were destroyed or lost. The largest collection of extant files is housed at the Eastern Regional Coal Archives, in [[Bluefield, West Virginia]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Organized labour}}\n* [[Anti-union violence]]\n* [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite book |last=Savage |first=Lon |authorlink= |title=Thunder in the Mountains: The West Virginia Mine War, 1920\u201321 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Thunder_in_the_Mountains.html?id=6Nl5PiTRwwMC |accessdate= |year=1990 |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press |location=Pittsburgh |isbn=978-0-8229-3634-3 |ref=harv}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Velke, ''Baldwin-Felts Detectives, Inc.''

The first Clock King was a villain and enemy of [[Green Arrow]], and debuted in ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' #111 (August 1960), and was created by [[France Herron]] and [[Lee Elias]].<ref name=Guide>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=70}}</ref>\n\nThe Clock King made his first live appearance in the 1960s ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' TV series, played by [[Walter Slezak]]. The character was later played in the [[Arrow (season 2)|second]] season of ''Arrow'' by [[Robert Knepper]]. Knepper's character also appeared on an episode of ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]''.\n\n==Publication history==\nThe first Clock King was originally an enemy of [[Green Arrow]]. He has no superpowers or abilities. He wears a clock mask, a cape, and a blue suit with clock drawings on it.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |title=The Essential Batman Encyclopedia |date=2008 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=9780345501066 |page=92}}</ref>\n\nClock King is a master planner and sometimes uses [[clock]]-themed gadgetry. The Clock King became more recently better known by his appearances in ''[[Justice League International]]'' and ''[[Suicide Squad]]''.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===William Tockman===\nBorn '''William Tockman''', the Clock King spends his early years taking care of his invalid sister. During one day, he finds out from a doctor's visit that he himself only has six months to live. Despairing for his sister's future, he watches the timing of a local bank's vault in order to rob it, hoping the money would provide for his sister after he was gone. His caper would have gone successfully, had he not tripped a silent alarm and been caught by the Green Arrow.<ref name=\"dc-ency\">{{Cite book  | last = Wallace | first = Dan | author-link = | contribution = Clock King | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | page = 84  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = New York  | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-7566-4119-1 | oclc = 213309017  }}</ref>\n\nWhile he is incarcerated, his sister dies alone. In further and hideous irony, Tockman discovers that he really is not terminally ill; his doctor had accidentally switched his papers with those of another patient. Infuriated, he escapes, later futilely attempting revenge on both the Green Arrow and the incompetent doctor.\n\nWith several other villains, the Clock King becomes a member of the [[Injustice League]], a team of out-of-luck supervillains who, when banding together, become even less successful than they have been in their individual careers.<ref>''Justice League International'' (vol. 1) #23 (January 1989)</ref> The Injustice League is defeated time and again by the [[Justice League International]], at least when they are not making laughingstocks of themselves. Trying to reform, the members later become the core of the equally laughable hero team [[Justice League Antarctica]]. This JLA includes G'Nort, who ends up saving the lives of the entire team.<ref>''Justice League America Annual'' #4 (October 1990)</ref> Like his compatriots, Clock King becomes an ardent supporter of [[Maxwell Lord]], partly due to the fact he is the only one willing to hire them. His group even guards Lord when he is incapacitated by a bullet wound.<ref>''Justice League America'' (vol. 1) #53 (August 1991)</ref> The villains again later reunite as the Injustice League as henchmen of [[Sonar (comics)|Sonar]].<ref>''Justice League Europe'' #49&ndash;50 (April&ndash;May 1993)</ref>\n\nLater, the Clock King leads his own separate team of villains in a mission. They consist of Radiant, Sharpe, Acidia, and Crackle. They are not as well-organized as even the Injustice League. For example, Crackle still lives with his mother and they have to take the bus to their fight. It takes place at a [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] toy store. They end up fighting one of the many incarnations of the [[Teen Titans]], the heroes [[Booster Gold]] and [[Firehawk (comics)|Firehawk]] and DEO agent [[Cameron Chase]]. An unclear super-effect from Chase ultimately neutralizes Clock King's team and they are all imprisoned. Clock King himself escapes on another bus.<ref>''Chase'' #4 (May 1998)</ref>\n\nStill later, Clock King and his Injustice League friends are transformed into the new [[Suicide Squad]]. They are sent to a remote research facility where a [[gene]]tic monstrosity is holding its creator hostage. Its main defenses are spawned \"children\" that could explode. During the mission, most of the team are seemingly killed, including Clock King, who is shot repeatedly in a retreat attempt. He is seen still alive after his brutal wounds but, in the end, [[Major Disaster]] believes he is the only one who survives. It turns out [[Cluemaster]], shot in a similar manner as Clock King, survives, albeit with drastic scarring.<ref>''Suicide Squad'' (second series) #1</ref><ref name=\"dc-ency\"/> [[Multi-Man]] also survives due to his ability to be reborn with new powers after dying.\n\nClock King is not seen for a period of time after ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''. In an issue of ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', one character decides to kill all the time-travelers, and mentions someone \"ending up like [[Time Commander (comics)|Time Commander]] and Clock Queen.\"\n\n===Terror Titans===\nA new Clock King appears in ''[[Teen Titans]]'' #56 as the head of a team of villains named the [[Terror Titans]]. In an interview with ''Teen Titans'' writer Sean McKeever, he described this Clock King as \"... Very smart. He sees things differently than others\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=144154 |title=Sean Mckeever On The Terror Titans - Newsarama |publisher=Forum.newsarama.com |date=2008-01-23 |accessdate=2010-12-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110211183237/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=144154 |archivedate=2011-02-11 }}</ref> Although his full name has not been confirmed, [[Disruptor (comics)|Disruptor]] did refer to him as \"'''Tem'''\" before being killed. His costume is similar to the suit worn by the Clock King seen in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', although with clock faces on the tie and lapel. After his group defeats and captures [[Kid Devil]],<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #56 (April 2008)</ref> Clock King conditions the hero<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #58 (June 2008)</ref> to be sold as a fighter to a group called \"The Dark Side Club\".<ref name=tt59>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #59 (July 2008)</ref> Clock King then brings the Titans to his base of operations, a dimension outside of time.<ref name=tt59 /> After besting Robin, Clock King is stymied by [[Rose Wilson|Ravager]], who possesses similar precognitive abilities.<ref name=tt60>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #60 (August 2008)</ref> He offers Ravager a chance to join him, but she refuses. Clock King then removes the Titans from his base and decides to move on to new plans. Ravager ultimately reconsiders his earlier offer.<ref name=tt59 /> In the ''Terror Titans'' miniseries, Clock King takes over the [[Dark Side Club]], and uses it to brainwash young metahumans, turning them into his very own \"Martyr Militia\". He sends the Militia to attack [[Los Angeles]], for no reason other than to amuse him.<ref>''Terror Titans'' #5 (April 2009)</ref> Clock King's plans are eventually undone by [[Miss Martian]], who was posing as one of the captured Metahumans, and Ravager, who attacks and defeats him, forcing him to flee his base of operations.<ref>''Terror Titans'' #6 (May 2009)</ref>\n\n===The New 52===\nIn September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, three different Clock Kings were shown existing:\n* '''Billy Tockman''' is an African-American crime boss based in Seattle. Tockman owns a nightclub called the Midnight Lounge, and vintage clock repair shop called the Clock King, which he uses as a front for his operations.<ref>''Green Arrow'' (vol. 5) #22 (September 2013)</ref> While Green Arrow is off dealing with The [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]], Diggle, along with Naomi Singh and Henry Fyff, talk Tockman into taking down [[Richard Dragon]], to which he agrees. When they meet to take down Dragon, Tockman betrays them, claiming Dragon made a better offer. When Green Arrow returns and faces Dragon, he holds Naomi and Fyff at gunpoint on Dragon's orders and ends up shooting Fyff, then promptly getting beat up and knocked out by [[Emiko Queen]].\n* Another Clock King, wearing the original Clock King costume, battles the newest incarnation of the [[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]] amped up on Venom.<ref>''Batman: The Dark Knight'' (vol. 2) #2 (October 2011)</ref> \n* Another, bearing an appearance similar to his Animated Series look (but with a black and blue suit and black and yellow glasses), tries to rob a store alongside his roommate [[Sportsmaster]] who he calls \"Bill\". He is stopped by Harley Quinn and Power Girl, but not before teleporting them into another dimension. He is shown to have the ability to rewind time.<ref>''Harley Quinn'' (vol. 2) #11-13. (December 2014)</ref>\n\n===DC Rebirth===\nIn the [[DC Rebirth]] relaunch, two Clock Kings are active:\n\n* A man who wears the classic Clock King costume, but with his face showing. This new version claims to be a temporal anomaly and feeds on the life force of others to maintain his youth, which led to him preying on African citizens. He is sheltered within the African nation of Buredunia under dictator Matthew Bland. His actions drew the attention of [[Deathstroke the Terminator]], who was assigned by Bland to kill Clock King as revenge for his murders. However, Clock King managed to save his life by revealing that the warlord would kill Deathstroke after he'd finished the job. He later kidnaps Bland. During the fight, Slade shoots him, revealing his powers to be special effects. Furthermore, Clock King revealed that as a time anomaly, he saw that as a result of [[Dr Manhattan]]'s [[Doomsday Clock (comics)|manipulation of the timestream]] led to the rebirth of Deathstroke's ally [[Wintergreen (comics)|Wintergreen]]. With that information, Deathstroke spared Clock King's life.<ref>Deathstroke: Rebirth & Deathstroke (vol. 4) #1</ref>\n* A former engineer and drug dealer in a suit, sporting glasses inherited from his grandfather<ref>Nightwing #24-25</ref> and a tattoo of a clock and arrow on the side of his head. He wired targets to clocks that can kill the wearer.<ref>Green Arrow (vol. 7)</ref> This version would later face Batman. He bragged that he would be able to predict every one of Batman's movements, but was defeated by a hiding [[Catwoman]].<ref>Batman (vol. 3) #14</ref> He was invited to a weapons deal by [[Tiger Shark]] and [[Blockbuster (DC Comics)|Blockbuster]] on board a ship, which was stopped by [[Nightwing]]. He is seen tinkering with his clocks as the ship sinks.<ref>Nightwing (2016) #22-28</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n* The original Clock King has no [[metahuman]] powers or abilities, although he is athletic and extraordinarily smart. He extensively uses clock and time -related gimmicks to devastating effect.\n* The second Clock King has the always-active ability to see what is about to happen four seconds or so into the future, allowing him to anticipate an opponent's every move.<ref name=tt59 /> He is also a technological genius, creating devices such as teleporters, communications jamming equipment, and even an anti-gravity platform, all of them modelled after timepieces.\n\n==Other versions==\n===Flashpoint===\nIn the alternate timeline of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' event, Clock King is imprisoned in [[Legion of Doom (Super Friends)|military Doom prison]]. During the prison break, Clock King joined [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]] and [[Plastic Man]] to retrieve his weapons.<ref>''Flashpoint: Legion of Doom'' #2 (July 2011)</ref>\n\n===''Batman '66''===\nIn ''[[Batman (TV series)#Batman '66|Batman '66]]'' Issue 4, the Clock King of the [[Batman (TV series)|60's series]] appears as a secret collaborator to the [[Mad Hatter (DC Comics)|Mad Hatter]]'s latest scheme. At the end, it's revealed that he is Jervis Tetch's brother Morris Tetch who made much of the Mad Hatter's more advanced weapons and described himself and his brother as both \"meticulous obsessives\", Jervis loving hats and Morris clocks.<ref>''Batman '66'' #4</ref>\n\n===''The Batman Adventures''===\nThe Clock King also makes an appearance in a 2004 ''[[The Batman Adventures]]'' comic. In this issue, he finally gets his revenge on Hill by rigging the mayoral election so that it seems that Oswald C. Cobblepot ([[Penguin (comics)|The Penguin]]) has won.\n\n===''Batman: The Brave and the Bold''===\nThe Clock King appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' comic, in \"President Batman\", where Clock King (along with [[Killer Croc]], [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]] and [[Two-Face]]) helps [[Doctor Psycho]] in his plan, until they are defeated by [[Wonder Woman]] and [[Batman]].\n\n===''Injustice''===\n====''Injustice: Gods Among Us''====\nThe Clock King makes a brief cameo in Chapter Eight of the ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'' comic, visibly shocked by the sudden appearance of [[Wonder Woman]] and [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] in the villains only bar called World's End.\n\n====''Injustice 2''====\nIn the prequel comic to ''[[Injustice 2]]'', Clock King is shown to be a member of this universe's [[Suicide Squad]].<ref>Injustice 2. #1</ref> After a mysterious villain (disguised as Batman) appears and takes control of the Squad, he kills the Clock King using the bomb implanted in his neck, considering him useless.<ref>Injustice 2. #3</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n====Live-action====\n[[File:B60s-Clocking.jpg|180px|right|thumb|[[Walter Slezak]] as the Clock King in the 1960s ''Batman'' show.]]\n[[File:Clock King (Robert Knepper).jpg|175px|thumb|right|[[Robert Knepper]] as William Tockman in ''Arrow''.]]\n* In the [[Batman (TV series)|1960s ''Batman'' TV series]], the Clock King was portrayed by [[Walter Slezak]] in the season two consecutive episodes, \"The Clock King's Crazy Crimes\" and \"The Clock King Gets Crowned\", which [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] transmitted on October 12 and October 13, 1966. The two-parter was written by ''Batman'' co-creator [[Bill Finger]] and [[Charles Sinclair (screenwriter)|Charles Sinclair]] and directed by [[James Neilson (director)|James Neilson]]. In the episode, the Clock King, disguised as a pop artist, tries to rob a gallery of a time-related [[surrealism|surrealist]] painting. Batman and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] are stuffed into the bottom of an oversized hourglass, stripped of their utility belts, and left to be drowned in sand as the Clock King plots to filch Bruce Wayne's collection of antique pocket watches, only for the duo to escape the trap later. Later in the episode, he starts his masterplan, to steal the atomic-powered [[Cesium clock]]. As the Clock King, Slezak wore a black cape and a top-hat with a clock inside it. He had many weapons such as \"Super Slick Watch Oil\", \"Knock Out Gas\", and \"Super Sonic Sound\".\n* The William Tockman version of Clock King is featured in multiple television series set in the [[Arrowverse]], portrayed by [[Robert Knepper]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/tvnews.php?id=112409 |title=Robert Knepper Cast as Clock King on Arrow |date=11 December 2013 | website=[[ComingSoon.net]] |accessdate=2014-11-12}}</ref> \n** The character made his debut in ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]''.<ref>[http://tvline.com/2013/12/03/glee-season-5-dianna-agron-returning-quinn-returns/ Ask Ausiello: Spoilers on Arrow, HIMYM, Once, Good Wife, Hannibal, Scandal, Sleepy and More]</ref> In the [[Arrow (season 2)|second season]] episode \"Time of Death\", the Clock King masterminds the theft of a hacking device that could be used to break into bank vaults and computer systems. It is revealed his motives are to raise money for medical treatment for his dying sister. He hacks into Felicity Smoak's computer system and disables it, causing her to physically get involved in the efforts to capture him. Aiming for the [[Black Canary|Canary]], Clock King ends up shooting Felicity after she pushes Canary out of the way. Felicity then defeats him by hacking into his cell phone and making it explode.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2014/02/arrow-season-2-timing-is-everything-in-time-of-death.html |title='Arrow' Season 2: Timing is everything in 'Time of Death' |access-date=2014-02-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302102126/http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2014/02/arrow-season-2-timing-is-everything-in-time-of-death.html |archive-date=2014-03-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n** The Clock King returns in ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]''.<ref name=\"ClockKing1\">{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2014/08/07/flash-arrow-crossover-episode-spoilers-clock-king/|title=Arrow's [Spoiler] Crosses Over to Flash|last=Swift|first=Andy|publisher=[[TV Line]]|date=August 7, 2014|accessdate=August 8, 2014}}</ref> In the episode \"Power Outage\", William Tockman is being escorted through the Central City police station, having been transferred for unspecified reasons. He subsequently takes advantage of a citywide blackout triggered by new villain [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Blackout|Blackout]]- during which he also temporarily negates the Flash's powers- to take those in the police station hostage, including [[Joe West (Arrowverse)|Joe West]] and his daughter [[Iris West|Iris]], but Iris manages to turn the tables on him when she is able to grab Eddie's gun from a hidden ankle holster before being taken as a hostage. She is shown shooting Tockman, who is wounded and once again arrested before Barry regains his powers and arrives to help.\n\n====Animation====\n* In ''[[The Batman]]'', a character named '''Francis Gray''' voiced by [[Dave Foley]] is very similar to the Clock King.\n* The William Tockman version of Clock King appears in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode \"Rise of the Blue Beetle!\" voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0810/22/index.htm |title=Comics Continuum by Rob Allstetter: Wednesday, October 22, 2008 |publisher=Comicscontinuum.com |date=2008-10-22 |accessdate=2010-12-25}}</ref> with a German accent. Like his original version in the comics, he possesses many clock-themed weapons and gadgets, and wears a modified version of his original costume. He is shown to resemble the Walter Slezak version of the character underneath his mask. To keep with the clock theme, he has two henchmen named Tick and Tock. The Clock King is defeated by Batman and [[Green Arrow]] after they escape his trap. He later appears in \"Day of the Dark Knight!\", trying to escape from [[Iron Heights Penitentiary]], but was thwarted by Batman and Green Arrow. A heroic version of Clock King appears in \"Deep Cover for Batman!\", but is taken down by the [[Crime Syndicate of America|Injustice Syndicate]]. Clock King joins forces with [[Owlman (comics)|Owlman]] and an army of villains in \"Game Over for Owlman!\" He also and briefly appears in \"Mayhem of The Music Meister!\", having teamed up with [[Black Manta]] and [[Gorilla Grodd]] to hijack a communications satellite before falling victim to the title villain's hypnotic powers. In \"Aquaman's Outrageous Adventure!\", Aquaman helps Green Arrow fight the Clock King. When they pursue him to a nearby store and Clock King threatens a woman, Aquaman contacts the lobsters in a nearby tank and has them attack Clock King.\n\n====={{anchor|Temple Fugate}}DC Animated Universe=====\n[[File:TempleFugate.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Temple Fugate/The Clock King as seen in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''.]]\n* A new incarnation of The Clock King appeared in multiple series throughout the [[DCAU]], voiced by [[Alan Rachins]].\n** In ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', the Clock King is recreated as '''Temple Fugate''' (the name being a play on the [[Latin]] phrase ''[[tempus fugit]]'', meaning \"time flies\") who first appears in the episode \"The Clock King\" and later returns in the episode \"Time Out of Joint\" voiced by [[Alan Rachins]]. In both appearances, the Clock King commonly dresses in a [[three-piece suit]] and [[bowler hat]], with a [[pocket watch]] and glasses resembling clock faces. In his debut episode \"The Clock King,\" Temple Fugate is a head of a [[time and motion study]] consulting company that has been fined $20 million (for an unspecified reason) in court, but is now appealing against it. Fugate is obsessed with time and punctuality; his every waking moment is pre-planned on a \"to do\" list broken down into precise blocks. Future Gotham mayor [[Hamilton Hill (comics)|Hamilton Hill]] convinces Fugate to break his schedule and take his coffee break at a slightly later time.  However, due to a string of terrible luck, Fugate shows up late for his court appointment, loses his appeal and goes bankrupt as a result. Fugate later learns that Hill's firm represented the plaintiff for the case Fugate was late for, and swears revenge on Hill for making him late, even though Hill personally had nothing to do with the case. Seven years later, Fugate becomes the Clock King and dedicates his life to destroying Hill. After publicly shaming Hill, Fugate has a confrontation with Batman inside a clock tower, and falls to his apparent death when the mechanisms are damaged. He returns in \"Time Out of Joint,\" once again vowing revenge on Hill. For this time, Fugate is aided by a device that allows him to manipulate time in the blink of an eye, stolen from a secluded scientist, which he uses to plant a bomb outside a courthouse that Hill is to inaugurate. His plan is foiled by Batman and Robin, who catch Fugate and send him to [[Arkham Asylum]].\n** [[Alan Rachins]] reprised his role as The Clock King (Fugate) in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode \"Task Force X\". He has been recruited by [[Project Cadmus]] as part of the [[Suicide Squad]] to coordinate the mission and its timing is largely down to the second, except for a few minutes Fugate allotted for contingencies in the field. The timing for the plan was so important that the members are ordered to go on without a teammate if they are even one second late.\n\n===Film===\n* The 1960s TV series version of Clock King appears in ''[[Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders]]''.

The first Clock King was a villain and enemy of [[Green Arrow]], and debuted in ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' #111 (August 1960), and was created by [[France Herron]] and [[Lee Elias]].<ref name=Guide>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=70}}</ref>\n\nThe Clock King made his first live appearance in the 1960s ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' TV series, played by [[Walter Slezak]]. The character was later played in the [[Arrow (season 2)|second]] season of ''Arrow'' by [[Robert Knepper]]. Knepper's character also appeared on an episode of ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]''.\n\n==Publication history==\nThe first Clock King was originally an enemy of [[Green Arrow]]. He has no superpowers or abilities. He wears a clock mask, a cape, and a blue suit with clock drawings on it.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |title=The Essential Batman Encyclopedia |date=2008 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=9780345501066 |page=92}}</ref>\n\nClock King is a master planner and sometimes uses [[clock]]-themed gadgetry. The Clock King became more recently better known by his appearances in ''[[Justice League International]]'' and ''[[Suicide Squad]]''.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===William Tockman===\nBorn '''William Tockman''', the Clock King spends his early years taking care of his invalid sister. During one day, he finds out from a doctor's visit that he himself only has six months to live. Despairing for his sister's future, he watches the timing of a local bank's vault in order to rob it, hoping the money would provide for his sister after he was gone. His caper would have gone successfully, had he not tripped a silent alarm and been caught by the Green Arrow.<ref name=\"dc-ency\">{{Cite book  | last = Wallace | first = Dan | author-link = | contribution = Clock King | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | page = 84  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = New York  | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-7566-4119-1 | oclc = 213309017  }}</ref>\n\nWhile he is incarcerated, his sister dies alone. In further and hideous irony, Tockman discovers that he really is not terminally ill; his doctor had accidentally switched his papers with those of another patient. Infuriated, he escapes, later futilely attempting revenge on both the Green Arrow and the incompetent doctor.\n\nWith several other villains, the Clock King becomes a member of the [[Injustice League]], a team of out-of-luck supervillains who, when banding together, become even less successful than they have been in their individual careers.<ref>''Justice League International'' (vol. 1) #23 (January 1989)</ref> The Injustice League is defeated time and again by the [[Justice League International]], at least when they are not making laughingstocks of themselves. Trying to reform, the members later become the core of the equally laughable hero team [[Justice League Antarctica]]. This JLA includes G'Nort, who ends up saving the lives of the entire team.<ref>''Justice League America Annual'' #4 (October 1990)</ref> Like his compatriots, Clock King becomes an ardent supporter of [[Maxwell Lord]], partly due to the fact he is the only one willing to hire them. His group even guards Lord when he is incapacitated by a bullet wound.<ref>''Justice League America'' (vol. 1) #53 (August 1991)</ref> The villains again later reunite as the Injustice League as henchmen of [[Sonar (comics)|Sonar]].<ref>''Justice League Europe'' #49&ndash;50 (April&ndash;May 1993)</ref>\n\nLater, the Clock King leads his own separate team of villains in a mission. They consist of Radiant, Sharpe, Acidia, and Crackle. They are not as well-organized as even the Injustice League. For example, Crackle still lives with his mother and they have to take the bus to their fight. It takes place at a [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] toy store. They end up fighting one of the many incarnations of the [[Teen Titans]], the heroes [[Booster Gold]] and [[Firehawk (comics)|Firehawk]] and DEO agent [[Cameron Chase]]. An unclear super-effect from Chase ultimately neutralizes Clock King's team and they are all imprisoned. Clock King himself escapes on another bus.<ref>''Chase'' #4 (May 1998)</ref>\n\nStill later, Clock King and his Injustice League friends are transformed into the new [[Suicide Squad]]. They are sent to a remote research facility where a [[gene]]tic monstrosity is holding its creator hostage. Its main defenses are spawned \"children\" that could explode. During the mission, most of the team are seemingly killed, including Clock King, who is shot repeatedly in a retreat attempt. He is seen still alive after his brutal wounds but, in the end, [[Major Disaster]] believes he is the only one who survives. It turns out [[Cluemaster]], shot in a similar manner as Clock King, survives, albeit with drastic scarring.<ref>''Suicide Squad'' (second series) #1</ref><ref name=\"dc-ency\"/> [[Multi-Man]] also survives due to his ability to be reborn with new powers after dying.\n\nClock King is not seen for a period of time after ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''. In an issue of ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', one character decides to kill all the time-travelers, and mentions someone \"ending up like [[Time Commander (comics)|Time Commander]] and Clock Queen.\"\n\n===Terror Titans===\nA new Clock King appears in ''[[Teen Titans]]'' #56 as the head of a team of villains named the [[Terror Titans]]. In an interview with ''Teen Titans'' writer Sean McKeever, he described this Clock King as \"... Very smart. He sees things differently than others\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=144154 |title=Sean Mckeever On The Terror Titans - Newsarama |publisher=Forum.newsarama.com |date=2008-01-23 |accessdate=2010-12-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110211183237/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=144154 |archivedate=2011-02-11 }}</ref> Although his full name has not been confirmed, [[Disruptor (comics)|Disruptor]] did refer to him as \"'''Tem'''\" before being killed. His costume is similar to the suit worn by the Clock King seen in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', although with clock faces on the tie and lapel. After his group defeats and captures [[Kid Devil]],<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #56 (April 2008)</ref> Clock King conditions the hero<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #58 (June 2008)</ref> to be sold as a fighter to a group called \"The Dark Side Club\".<ref name=tt59>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #59 (July 2008)</ref> Clock King then brings the Titans to his base of operations, a dimension outside of time.<ref name=tt59 /> After besting Robin, Clock King is stymied by [[Rose Wilson|Ravager]], who possesses similar precognitive abilities.<ref name=tt60>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #60 (August 2008)</ref> He offers Ravager a chance to join him, but she refuses. Clock King then removes the Titans from his base and decides to move on to new plans. Ravager ultimately reconsiders his earlier offer.<ref name=tt59 /> In the ''Terror Titans'' miniseries, Clock King takes over the [[Dark Side Club]], and uses it to brainwash young metahumans, turning them into his very own \"Martyr Militia\". He sends the Militia to attack [[Los Angeles]], for no reason other than to amuse him.<ref>''Terror Titans'' #5 (April 2009)</ref> Clock King's plans are eventually undone by [[Miss Martian]], who was posing as one of the captured Metahumans, and Ravager, who attacks and defeats him, forcing him to flee his base of operations.<ref>''Terror Titans'' #6 (May 2009)</ref>\n\n===The New 52===\nIn September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, three different Clock Kings were shown existing:\n* '''Billy Tockman''' is an African-American crime boss based in Seattle. Tockman owns a nightclub called the Midnight Lounge, and vintage clock repair shop called the Clock King, which he uses as a front for his operations.<ref>''Green Arrow'' (vol. 5) #22 (September 2013)</ref> While Green Arrow is off dealing with The [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]], Diggle, along with Naomi Singh and Henry Fyff, talk Tockman into taking down [[Richard Dragon]], to which he agrees. When they meet to take down Dragon, Tockman betrays them, claiming Dragon made a better offer. When Green Arrow returns and faces Dragon, he holds Naomi and Fyff at gunpoint on Dragon's orders and ends up shooting Fyff, then promptly getting beat up and knocked out by [[Emiko Queen]].\n* Another Clock King, wearing the original Clock King costume, battles the newest incarnation of the [[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]] amped up on Venom.<ref>''Batman: The Dark Knight'' (vol. 2) #2 (October 2011)</ref> \n* Another, bearing an appearance similar to his Animated Series look (but with a black and blue suit and black and yellow glasses), tries to rob a store alongside his roommate [[Sportsmaster]] who he calls \"Bill\". He is stopped by Harley Quinn and Power Girl, but not before teleporting them into another dimension. He is shown to have the ability to rewind time.<ref>''Harley Quinn'' (vol. 2) #11-13. (December 2014)</ref>\n\n===DC Rebirth===\nIn the [[DC Rebirth]] relaunch, two Clock Kings are active:\n\n* A man who wears the classic Clock King costume, but with his face showing. This new version claims to be a temporal anomaly and feeds on the life force of others to maintain his youth, which led to him preying on African citizens. He is sheltered within the African nation of Buredunia under dictator Matthew Bland. His actions drew the attention of [[Deathstroke the Terminator]], who was assigned by Bland to kill Clock King as revenge for his murders. However, Clock King managed to save his life by revealing that the warlord would kill Deathstroke after he'd finished the job. He later kidnaps Bland. During the fight, Slade shoots him, revealing his powers to be special effects. Furthermore, Clock King revealed that as a time anomaly, he saw that as a result of [[Dr Manhattan]]'s [[Doomsday Clock (comics)|manipulation of the timestream]] led to the rebirth of Deathstroke's ally [[Wintergreen (comics)|Wintergreen]]. With that information, Deathstroke spared Clock King's life.<ref>Deathstroke: Rebirth & Deathstroke (vol. 4) #1</ref>\n* A former engineer and drug dealer in a suit, sporting glasses inherited from his grandfather<ref>Nightwing #24-25</ref> and a tattoo of a clock and arrow on the side of his head. He wired targets to clocks that can kill the wearer.<ref>Green Arrow (vol. 7)</ref> This version would later face Batman. He bragged that he would be able to predict every one of Batman's movements, but was defeated by a hiding [[Catwoman]].<ref>Batman (vol. 3) #14</ref> He was invited to a weapons deal by [[Tiger Shark]] and [[Blockbuster]] onboard a ship, which was stopped by [[Nightwing]]. He is seen tinkering with his clocks as the ship sinks.<ref>Nightwing (2016) #22-28</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n* The original Clock King has no [[metahuman]] powers or abilities, although he is athletic and extraordinarily smart. He extensively uses clock and time -related gimmicks to devastating effect.\n* The second Clock King has the always-active ability to see what is about to happen four seconds or so into the future, allowing him to anticipate an opponent's every move.<ref name=tt59 /> He is also a technological genius, creating devices such as teleporters, communications jamming equipment, and even an anti-gravity platform, all of them modelled after timepieces.\n\n==Other versions==\n===Flashpoint===\nIn the alternate timeline of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' event, Clock King is imprisoned in [[Legion of Doom (Super Friends)|military Doom prison]]. During the prison break, Clock King joined [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]] and [[Plastic Man]] to retrieve his weapons.<ref>''Flashpoint: Legion of Doom'' #2 (July 2011)</ref>\n\n===''Batman '66''===\nIn ''[[Batman (TV series)#Batman '66|Batman '66]]'' Issue 4, the Clock King of the [[Batman (TV series)|60's series]] appears as a secret collaborator to the [[Mad Hatter (DC Comics)|Mad Hatter]]'s latest scheme. At the end, it's revealed that he is Jervis Tetch's brother Morris Tetch who made much of the Mad Hatter's more advanced weapons and described himself and his brother as both \"meticulous obsessives\", Jervis loving hats and Morris clocks.<ref>''Batman '66'' #4</ref>\n\n===''The Batman Adventures''===\nThe Clock King also makes an appearance in a 2004 ''[[The Batman Adventures]]'' comic. In this issue, he finally gets his revenge on Hill by rigging the mayoral election so that it seems that Oswald C. Cobblepot ([[Penguin (comics)|The Penguin]]) has won.\n\n===''Batman: The Brave and the Bold''===\nThe Clock King appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' comic, in \"President Batman\", where Clock King (along with [[Killer Croc]], [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]] and [[Two-Face]]) helps [[Doctor Psycho]] in his plan, until they are defeated by [[Wonder Woman]] and [[Batman]].\n\n===''Injustice''===\n====''Injustice: Gods Among Us''====\nThe Clock King makes a brief cameo in Chapter Eight of the ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'' comic, visibly shocked by the sudden appearance of [[Wonder Woman]] and [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] in the villains only bar called World's End.\n\n====''Injustice 2''====\nIn the prequel comic to ''[[Injustice 2]]'', Clock King is shown to be a member of this universe's [[Suicide Squad]].<ref>Injustice 2. #1</ref> After a mysterious villain (disguised as Batman) appears and takes control of the Squad, he kills the Clock King using the bomb implanted in his neck, considering him useless.<ref>Injustice 2. #3</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n====Live-action====\n[[File:B60s-Clocking.jpg|180px|right|thumb|[[Walter Slezak]] as the Clock King in the 1960s ''Batman'' show.]]\n[[File:Clock King (Robert Knepper).jpg|175px|thumb|right|[[Robert Knepper]] as William Tockman in ''Arrow''.]]\n* In the [[Batman (TV series)|1960s ''Batman'' TV series]], the Clock King was portrayed by [[Walter Slezak]] in the season two consecutive episodes, \"The Clock King's Crazy Crimes\" and \"The Clock King Gets Crowned\", which [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] transmitted on October 12 and October 13, 1966. The two-parter was written by ''Batman'' co-creator [[Bill Finger]] and [[Charles Sinclair (screenwriter)|Charles Sinclair]] and directed by [[James Neilson (director)|James Neilson]]. In the episode, the Clock King, disguised as a pop artist, tries to rob a gallery of a time-related [[surrealism|surrealist]] painting. Batman and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] are stuffed into the bottom of an oversized hourglass, stripped of their utility belts, and left to be drowned in sand as the Clock King plots to filch Bruce Wayne's collection of antique pocket watches, only for the duo to escape the trap later. Later in the episode, he starts his masterplan, to steal the atomic-powered [[Cesium clock]]. As the Clock King, Slezak wore a black cape and a top-hat with a clock inside it. He had many weapons such as \"Super Slick Watch Oil\", \"Knock Out Gas\", and \"Super Sonic Sound\".\n* The William Tockman version of Clock King is featured in multiple television series set in the [[Arrowverse]], portrayed by [[Robert Knepper]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/tvnews.php?id=112409 |title=Robert Knepper Cast as Clock King on Arrow |date=11 December 2013 | website=[[ComingSoon.net]] |accessdate=2014-11-12}}</ref> \n** The character made his debut in ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]''.<ref>[http://tvline.com/2013/12/03/glee-season-5-dianna-agron-returning-quinn-returns/ Ask Ausiello: Spoilers on Arrow, HIMYM, Once, Good Wife, Hannibal, Scandal, Sleepy and More]</ref> In the [[Arrow (season 2)|second season]] episode \"Time of Death\", the Clock King masterminds the theft of a hacking device that could be used to break into bank vaults and computer systems. It is revealed his motives are to raise money for medical treatment for his dying sister. He hacks into Felicity Smoak's computer system and disables it, causing her to physically get involved in the efforts to capture him. Aiming for the [[Black Canary|Canary]], Clock King ends up shooting Felicity after she pushes Canary out of the way. Felicity then defeats him by hacking into his cell phone and making it explode.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2014/02/arrow-season-2-timing-is-everything-in-time-of-death.html |title='Arrow' Season 2: Timing is everything in 'Time of Death' |access-date=2014-02-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302102126/http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2014/02/arrow-season-2-timing-is-everything-in-time-of-death.html |archive-date=2014-03-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n** The Clock King returns in ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]''.<ref name=\"ClockKing1\">{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2014/08/07/flash-arrow-crossover-episode-spoilers-clock-king/|title=Arrow's [Spoiler] Crosses Over to Flash|last=Swift|first=Andy|publisher=[[TV Line]]|date=August 7, 2014|accessdate=August 8, 2014}}</ref> In the episode \"Power Outage\", William Tockman is being escorted through the Central City police station, having been transferred for unspecified reasons. He subsequently takes advantage of a citywide blackout triggered by new villain [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Blackout|Blackout]]- during which he also temporarily negates the Flash's powers- to take those in the police station hostage, including [[Joe West (Arrowverse)|Joe West]] and his daughter [[Iris West|Iris]], but Iris manages to turn the tables on him when she is able to grab Eddie's gun from a hidden ankle holster before being taken as a hostage. She is shown shooting Tockman, who is wounded and once again arrested before Barry regains his powers and arrives to help.\n\n====Animation====\n* In ''[[The Batman]]'', a character named '''Francis Gray''' voiced by [[Dave Foley]] is very similar to the Clock King.\n* The William Tockman version of Clock King appears in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode \"Rise of the Blue Beetle!\" voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0810/22/index.htm |title=Comics Continuum by Rob Allstetter: Wednesday, October 22, 2008 |publisher=Comicscontinuum.com |date=2008-10-22 |accessdate=2010-12-25}}</ref> with a German accent. Like his original version in the comics, he possesses many clock-themed weapons and gadgets, and wears a modified version of his original costume. He is shown to resemble the Walter Slezak version of the character underneath his mask. To keep with the clock theme, he has two henchmen named Tick and Tock. The Clock King is defeated by Batman and [[Green Arrow]] after they escape his trap. He later appears in \"Day of the Dark Knight!\", trying to escape from [[Iron Heights Penitentiary]], but was thwarted by Batman and Green Arrow. A heroic version of Clock King appears in \"Deep Cover for Batman!\", but is taken down by the [[Crime Syndicate of America|Injustice Syndicate]]. Clock King joins forces with [[Owlman (comics)|Owlman]] and an army of villains in \"Game Over for Owlman!\" He also and briefly appears in \"Mayhem of The Music Meister!\", having teamed up with [[Black Manta]] and [[Gorilla Grodd]] to hijack a communications satellite before falling victim to the title villain's hypnotic powers. In \"Aquaman's Outrageous Adventure!\", Aquaman helps Green Arrow fight the Clock King. When they pursue him to a nearby store and Clock King threatens a woman, Aquaman contacts the lobsters in a nearby tank and has them attack Clock King.\n\n====={{anchor|Temple Fugate}}DC Animated Universe=====\n[[File:TempleFugate.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Temple Fugate/The Clock King as seen in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''.]]\n* A new incarnation of The Clock King appeared in multiple series throughout the [[DCAU]], voiced by [[Alan Rachins]].\n** In ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', the Clock King is recreated as '''Temple Fugate''' (the name being a play on the [[Latin]] phrase ''[[tempus fugit]]'', meaning \"time flies\") who first appears in the episode \"The Clock King\" and later returns in the episode \"Time Out of Joint\" voiced by [[Alan Rachins]]. In both appearances, the Clock King commonly dresses in a [[three-piece suit]] and [[bowler hat]], with a [[pocket watch]] and glasses resembling clock faces. In his debut episode \"The Clock King,\" Temple Fugate is a head of a [[time and motion study]] consulting company that has been fined $20 million (for an unspecified reason) in court, but is now appealing against it. Fugate is obsessed with time and punctuality; his every waking moment is pre-planned on a \"to do\" list broken down into precise blocks. Future Gotham mayor [[Hamilton Hill (comics)|Hamilton Hill]] convinces Fugate to break his schedule and take his coffee break at a slightly later time.  However, due to a string of terrible luck, Fugate shows up late for his court appointment, loses his appeal and goes bankrupt as a result. Fugate later learns that Hill's firm represented the plaintiff for the case Fugate was late for, and swears revenge on Hill for making him late, even though Hill personally had nothing to do with the case. Seven years later, Fugate becomes the Clock King and dedicates his life to destroying Hill. After publicly shaming Hill, Fugate has a confrontation with Batman inside a clock tower, and falls to his apparent death when the mechanisms are damaged. He returns in \"Time Out of Joint,\" once again vowing revenge on Hill. For this time, Fugate is aided by a device that allows him to manipulate time in the blink of an eye, stolen from a secluded scientist, which he uses to plant a bomb outside a courthouse that Hill is to inaugurate. His plan is foiled by Batman and Robin, who catch Fugate and send him to [[Arkham Asylum]].\n** [[Alan Rachins]] reprised his role as The Clock King (Fugate) in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode \"Task Force X\". He has been recruited by [[Project Cadmus]] as part of the [[Suicide Squad]] to coordinate the mission and its timing is largely down to the second, except for a few minutes Fugate allotted for contingencies in the field. The timing for the plan was so important that the members are ordered to go on without a teammate if they are even one second late.\n\n===Film===\n* The 1960s TV series version of Clock King appears in ''[[Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders]]''.

Among those people preferring body parts, feet and toes were preferred by the greatest number, with 47% of those sampled preferring them.

In one study, conducted by Dr. A James Giannini at [[Ohio State University]], an increased interest in feet as sexual objects was observed during the great [[gonorrhea]] epidemic of twelfth-century Europe, and the [[syphilis]] epidemics of the 16th and 19th centuries in Europe.<ref>AJ Giannini et al., op. cit.</ref> In the same study, the frequency of foot-fetish depictions in [[pornographic literature]] was measured over a 30-year interval.

Researchers estimated the prevalence of different fetishes based on the following elements:\n\n* (a) the number of discussion groups devoted to a particular fetish;\n* (b) the number of individuals participating in the groups;\n* (c) the number of messages exchanged.\n\nIt was concluded that the most common fetishes were for body parts or for objects usually associated with body parts (33% and 30% respectively). Among those people preferring body parts, feet and toes were preferred by the greatest number, with 47% of those sampled preferring them. Among those people preferring objects related to body parts, 32% were in groups related to footwear (shoes, boots, etc.).<ref name=\"scorolli\" />\n\nFoot fetishism is the most common form of sexual fetish related to the body.<ref name=ryan>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/rex-ryans-foot-video-not-necessarily-unhealthy/story?id=12467617 |title=Rex Ryan's Apparent Foot Fetish not Necessarily Unhealthy \u2013 ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=23 December 2010 |accessdate=14 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2006, [[AOL]] released a database of the search terms submitted by their subscribers.

In one study, conducted by Dr. A James Giannini at [[Ohio State University]], an increased interest in feet as sexual objects was observed during the great [[gonorrhea]] epidemic of twelfth-century Europe, and the [[syphilis]] epidemics of the 16th and 19th centuries in Europe.<ref>AJ Giannini et al., op. cit.</ref> In the same study, the frequency of foot-fetish depictions in [[pornographic literature]] was measured over a 30-year interval.
