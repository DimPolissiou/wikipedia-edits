In modern times, the smiley has become known for its yellow face and has evolved from a simple smiling face to display a range of facial emotions. Drawings of smileys have been traced back to ancient times, often displayed in caves and were often just two eyes and a curved upwards mouth.\n\nThe classic form designed by [[Harvey Ball]] in 1963 comprises a yellow circle with two black dots representing eyes and a black arc representing the mouth ('''{{emoji|263A}}'''). On the Internet and in other [[plain text]] communication channels, the [[emoticon]] form (sometimes also called the '''smiley-face emoticon''') has traditionally been most popular, typically employing a [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]] and a right [[parenthesis]] to form sequences such as '''<code>:-)</code>''', '''<code>:)</code>''', '''<code>=)</code>''', '''<code>=D</code>''', or '''<code>(:</code jvubibibibonononihib a smiling face when viewed after rotation through 90 degrees. \"Smiley\" is also sometimes used as a generic term for any emoticon (see [[Emoji]]). The smiley has been referenced in nearly all areas of Western culture including music, movies, and art. The smiley has also been associated with late 1980s and early 1990s [[rave]] culture.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/feb/21/=Smiley Face Design History |author= Jon Savage |date=February 21, 2009 |accessdate= October 5, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://thump.vice.com/en_ca/article/history-smiley-face-acid-house-rave-culture-shoom|title=A Brief History of the Smiley Face, Rave Culture's Most Ubiquitous Symbol |author=Michaelangelo Matos |date=December 21, 2016 |accessdate=May 1, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.youredm.com/2015/07/23/the-evolution-of-rave-fashion/|title=The Evolution of Rave Fashion  |first=Brian |last= Lim |date=July 23, 2015 |accessdate=May 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe plural form \"smilies\" is commonly used,<ref>[[Google Ngram Viewer]]: [https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=smileys%2Csmilies&year_start=1900 smilies vs smileys]</ref> but the variant spelling \"[[wikt:smilie|smilie]]\" is not as common as the \"y\" spelling.<ref>[[Google Ngram Viewer]]: [https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=smiley%2Csmilie&year_start=1900 smilie vs smiley]</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Early history of smiling faces===\nFor thousands of years smiling faces have been used as [[ideogram]]s and as [[pictogram]]s. In recent times, the face now known as a smiley has evolved into a well-known image and brand, recognisable for its yellow and black features. It wasn't until the 1900s that the design evolved from a basic eyes and mouth design, into a more recognisable design. \n\nThe oldest known smiling face was found by a team of [[archaeology|archaeologists]] led by Nicol\u00f2 Marchetti of the [[University of Bologna]]. Marchetti and his team pieced together fragments of a [[Hittites|Hittite]] pot from approximately 1700 BC that had been found in [[Karkam\u0131\u015f]], [[Turkey]]. Once the pot had been pieced together, the team noticed that the item had a large smiling face engraved on it, becoming the first item to with such a design to be found.<ref>{{cite news |last=Borschel-Dan  |first=Amanda |date=July 19, 2017 |title=History\u2019s 'oldest smile' found on 4,000-year-old pot in Turkey |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/historys-oldest-smile-found-on-4000-year-old-pot-in-turkey/ |work=The Times of Israel |access-date=July 28, 2017}}</ref> In 1635, a gold smiling face was drawn on the bottom of a legal document in [[Slovakia]], appearing next to lawyer's Jan Ladislaides signature.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ghosh |first1=Shreesha |title=World's Oldest Emoji Discovered?

Jensen]] was amongst other things famous for experimenting with the form of his writing. In a letter sent to publisher Ernst Bojesen in December 1900, he includes both a happy face and a sad face.\n\nOne of the first commercial uses of a smiling face was in 1919, when the Buffalo Steam Roller Company in [[Buffalo, New York]] applied stickers on receipts with the word ''\"thanks\"'' and a smiling face above it. The face contained a lot of detail, having eyebrows, nose, teeth, chin and facial creases, reminiscent of \"man-in-the-moon\" style characteristics.\n\n[[Ingmar Bergman]]'s 1948 film ''[[Port of Call (1948 film)|Port of Call]]'' includes a scene where the unhappy Berit draws a ''sad'' face {{ndash}} closely resembling the modern \"frowny\", but including a dot for the nose {{ndash}} in lipstick on her mirror, before being interrupted.<ref>''Ingmarbergman.se''. [http://ingmarbergman.se/sites/default/files/hamnstad_1948-26_005_huvudbild_webb.jpg A still from the scene].</ref> In 1953 and 1958, similar happy faces were used in promotional campaigns for the films ''[[Lili]]'' (1953) and ''[[Gigi (1958 film)|Gigi]]'' (1958).\n\n===The yellow and black happy face===\nIn the [[United States]], the first time a combination of yellow and black was used for a smiling face was in late 1962. During the 1960s and early 70s, a number of designers created smiling faces, which were categorised as \"happy faces.\" The WMCA happy face, became synonymous with 1960s culture in [[New York City]]. The New York-based radio station used the happy face as part of a competition for listeners. When the station called listeners, any listener who answered their phone \"WMCA Good Guys!\" was rewarded with a \"WMCA good guys\" sweatshirt that incorporated the yellow and black happy face into its design. Throughout the 1960s, thousands of these sweatshirts were given away.<ref>{{citation |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/9059885/Smileys-People-Radio-4-The-million-dollar-smile.html |title= Smiley's People (Radio 4): The million dollar smile |author= Alastair Sooke |date= February 3, 2012 |work= The Telegraph |quote= [Loufrani] points out that a smiley face was a key feature of a well-known promotional campaign for a radio network on America\u2019s East Coast in the late Fifties.}}</ref><ref name=nyt2001 /><ref name=lennox /> The features of the WMCA smiley was a yellow face, with black dots as eyes and had a slightly crooked smile.

Ball created the design in ten minutes and was paid $45 ({{Inflation|US|45|1963|fmt=eq}}). His rendition, with a bright yellow background, dark oval eyes, full smile, and creases at the sides of the mouth,<ref name=lennox/> was imprinted on more than fifty million buttons and became familiar around the world. The design is so simple that it is certain that similar versions were produced before 1963, including those cited above. However, Ball\u2019s rendition, as described here, has become the most iconic version.<ref name=nyt2001>{{cite news |first=William H. |last=Honan |author-link=William H. Honan |title=H. R.

Tenagi's design was used in an advertising campaign for Seattle-based University Federal Savings & Loan. The ad campaign was inspired by [[Lee Adams]]'s lyrics in \"Put on a Happy Face\" from the musical ''[[Bye Bye Birdie]]''. Stern, the man behind this campaign, also later incorporated the Happy Face in his run for Seattle mayor in 1993.<ref name=\"Adams\"/>\n\nThe graphic was further popularized in the early 1970s by Philadelphia brothers Bernard and Murray Spain, who seized upon it in September 1970 in a campaign to sell novelty items. The two produced buttons as well as coffee mugs, [[t-shirts]], [[bumper stickers]] and many other items emblazoned with the symbol and the phrase \"Have a happy day\", which mutated into \"[[Have a nice day]]\". Working with New York button manufacturer NG Slater, some 50 million happy face badges were produced by 1972.<ref name=\"Peter Shapiro 2001, pp44-49\">Peter Shapiro, \"Smiling Faces Sometimes\", in ''The Wire'', issue 203, January 2001, pp. 44\u201349.</ref>\n\n===Evolution into the smiley===\nIn 1972, Frenchman Franklin Loufrani became the first person to legally [[trademark]] the use of a smiley face. He used it to highlight the good news parts of the newspaper ''[[France Soir]]''. He simply called the design \"Smiley\" and launched [[The Smiley Company]]. In 1996 Loufrani's son Nicolas Loufrani took over the family business and built it into a multinational corporation. Nicolas Loufrani was outwardly skeptical of Harvey Ball's claim to creating the first smiley face. While noting that the design that his father came up with and Ball's design were nearly identical, Loufrani argued that the design is so simple that no one person can lay claim to having created it. As evidence for this, Loufrani's website points to early cave paintings found in France (2500 BC) that he claims are the first depictions of a smiley face. Loufrani also points to a 1960 radio ad campaign that reportedly made use of a similar design.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/who-really-invented-the-smiley-face-2058483/?no-ist|title=Who Really Invented the Smiley Face?|author=Jimmy Stamp|work=Smithsonian}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Authentic Worcester-made smiley face, Harvey Ball.jpg|thumb|right|\"Authentic [[Hanover Insurance|Worcester]]-made smiley face\", by Harvey Ball]]\nThe rights to the Smiley trademark in one hundred countries are owned by the Smiley Company.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/05/business/worldbusiness/05smiley.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first=Thomas | last=Crampton | title=Smiley Face Is Serious to Company | date=July 5, 2006}}</ref> Its subsidiary SmileyWorld Ltd, in London, headed by Nicolas Loufrani, creates or approves all the Smiley products sold in countries where it holds the trademark.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_id/article/j5pyyb/the-man-who-owns-the-smiley-face|title=The Man Who Owns the Smiley Face|date=August 10, 2017|work=Vice|access-date=January 24, 2018|language=en-id}}</ref> The Smiley brand and logo have significant exposure through licensees in sectors such as clothing, home decoration, perfumery, plush, stationery, publishing, and through promotional campaigns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.licensing.biz/company-profiles/24/Smiley-Licensing |title=Smiley Licensing &#124; Company Profile by |website=Licensing.biz |accessdate=March 14, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229123013/http://www.licensing.biz/company-profiles/24/Smiley-Licensing |archivedate=February 29, 2012 }}</ref> The Smiley Company is one of the 100 biggest licensing companies in the world, with a turnover of US$167 million in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rankingthebrands.com/PDF/Top%20125%20Global%20Licensors%202011,%20License%20Global.pdf|format=PDF|title=Global License : Ranking the brands|website=Rankingthebrands.com|accessdate=September 21, 2018}}</ref> The first Smiley shop opened in London in the [[Boxpark]] shopping centre in December 2011.<ref>{{cite web |author=Giedrius Ivanauskas |url=http://madeinshoreditch.co.uk/2012/01/16/boxpark-shoreditch-interview-with-nicolas-loufrani-ceo-of-smiley/ |title=Boxpark Shoreditch: Interview with Nicolas Loufrani CEO of Smiley &#124; Made in Shoreditch - A Magazine About Style, Innovation, Dining, Nightlife and People in Shoreditch |publisher=Made in Shoreditch |date=January 16, 2012 |accessdate=March 14, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307075637/http://madeinshoreditch.co.uk/2012/01/16/boxpark-shoreditch-interview-with-nicolas-loufrani-ceo-of-smiley/ |archivedate=March 7, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, Franklin Loufrani and Smiley World attempted to acquire trademark rights to the symbol (and even to the word \"smiley\" itself) in the United States.

Beginning in the 1960s, a yellow ''happy face'' was used by numerous brands in print to demonstrate happiness.\n\n===In print===\nFranklin Loufrani first introduced the word smiley when he designed a smiling face for the newspaper he was working for at the time. The Loufrani design came in 1971, when Loufrani designed a smiley face for the newspaper, ''[[France-Soir]]''.

However, the first industry to mass adopt the smiley was in [[comics]] and cartoons.\n\n===Music===\nAs music genres began to create their own cultures from the 1970s onwards, many cultures began to incorporate a smiling face into their culture. In the late 1970s, the [[United States|American]] band [[Dead Kennedys]] launched their first recording, \"[[California \u00dcber Alles]]\". The single cover was a collage aimed to look like that of a [[Nazi]] rally prior to [[World War II]].

In modern times, the smiley has become known for its yellow face and has evolved from a simple smiling face to display a range of facial emotions. Drawings of smileys have been traced back to ancient times, often displayed in caves and were often just two eyes and a curved upwards mouth.\n\nThe classic form designed by [[Harvey Ball]] in 1963 comprises a yellow circle with two black dots representing eyes and a black arc representing the mouth ('''{{emoji|263A}}'''). On the Internet and in other [[plain text]] communication channels, the [[emoticon]] form (sometimes also called the '''smiley-face emoticon''') has traditionally been most popular, typically employing a [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]] and a right [[parenthesis]] to form sequences such as '''<code>:-)</code>''', '''<code>:)</code>''', '''<code>=)</code>''', '''<code>=D</code>''', or '''<code>(:</code>''' that resemble a smiling face when viewed after rotation through 90 degrees. \"Smiley\" is also sometimes used as a generic term for any emoticon (see [[Emoji]]). The smiley has been referenced in nearly all areas of Western culture including music, movies, and art. The smiley has also been associated with late 1980s and early 1990s [[rave]] culture.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/feb/21/smiley-face-design-history |title=Smiley Face Design History |author= Jon Savage |date=February 21, 2009 |accessdate= October 5, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://thump.vice.com/en_ca/article/history-smiley-face-acid-house-rave-culture-shoom|title=A Brief History of the Smiley Face, Rave Culture's Most Ubiquitous Symbol |author=Michaelangelo Matos |date=December 21, 2016 |accessdate=May 1, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.youredm.com/2015/07/23/the-evolution-of-rave-fashion/|title=The Evolution of Rave Fashion  |first=Brian |last= Lim |date=July 23, 2015 |accessdate=May 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe plural form \"smilies\" is commonly used,<ref>[[Google Ngram Viewer]]: [https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=smileys%2Csmilies&year_start=1900 smilies vs smileys]</ref> but the variant spelling \"[[wikt:smilie|smilie]]\" is not as common as the \"y\" spelling.<ref>[[Google Ngram Viewer]]: [https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=smiley%2Csmilie&year_start=1900 smilie vs smiley]</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Early history of smiling faces===\nFor thousands of years smiling faces have been used as [[ideogram]]s and as [[pictogram]]s. In recent times, the face now known as a smiley has evolved into a well-known image and brand, recognisable for its yellow and black features. It wasn't until the 1900s that the design evolved from a basic eyes and mouth design, into a more recognisable design. \n\nThe oldest known smiling face was found by a team of [[archaeology|archaeologists]] led by Nicol\u00f2 Marchetti of the [[University of Bologna]]. Marchetti and his team pieced together fragments of a [[Hittites|Hittite]] pot from approximately 1700 BC that had been found in [[Karkam\u0131\u015f]], [[Turkey]]. Once the pot had been pieced together, the team noticed that the item had a large smiling face engraved on it, becoming the first item to with such a design to be found.<ref>{{cite news |last=Borschel-Dan  |first=Amanda |date=July 19, 2017 |title=History\u2019s 'oldest smile' found on 4,000-year-old pot in Turkey |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/historys-oldest-smile-found-on-4000-year-old-pot-in-turkey/ |work=The Times of Israel |access-date=July 28, 2017}}</ref> In 1635, a gold smiling face was drawn on the bottom of a legal document in [[Slovakia]], appearing next to lawyer's Jan Ladislaides signature.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ghosh |first1=Shreesha |title=World's Oldest Emoji Discovered?

Jensen]] was amongst other things famous for experimenting with the form of his writing. In a letter sent to publisher Ernst Bojesen in December 1900, he includes both a happy face and a sad face.\n\nOne of the first commercial uses of a smiling face was in 1919, when the Buffalo Steam Roller Company in [[Buffalo, New York]] applied stickers on receipts with the word ''\"thanks\"'' and a smiling face above it. The face contained a lot of detail, having eyebrows, nose, teeth, chin and facial creases, reminiscent of \"man-in-the-moon\" style characteristics.\n\n[[Ingmar Bergman]]'s 1948 film ''[[Port of Call (1948 film)|Port of Call]]'' includes a scene where the unhappy Berit draws a ''sad'' face {{ndash}} closely resembling the modern \"frowny\", but including a dot for the nose {{ndash}} in lipstick on her mirror, before being interrupted.<ref>''Ingmarbergman.se''. [http://ingmarbergman.se/sites/default/files/hamnstad_1948-26_005_huvudbild_webb.jpg A still from the scene].</ref> In 1953 and 1958, similar happy faces were used in promotional campaigns for the films ''[[Lili]]'' (1953) and ''[[Gigi (1958 film)|Gigi]]'' (1958).\n\n===The yellow and black happy face===\nIn the [[United States]], the first time a combination of yellow and black was used for a smiling face was in late 1962. During the 1960s and early 70s, a number of designers created smiling faces, which were categorised as \"happy faces.\" The WMCA happy face, became synonymous with 1960s culture in [[New York City]]. The New York-based radio station used the happy face as part of a competition for listeners. When the station called listeners, any listener who answered their phone \"WMCA Good Guys!\" was rewarded with a \"WMCA good guys\" sweatshirt that incorporated the yellow and black happy face into its design. Throughout the 1960s, thousands of these sweatshirts were given away.<ref>{{citation |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/9059885/Smileys-People-Radio-4-The-million-dollar-smile.html |title= Smiley's People (Radio 4): The million dollar smile |author= Alastair Sooke |date= February 3, 2012 |work= The Telegraph |quote= [Loufrani] points out that a smiley face was a key feature of a well-known promotional campaign for a radio network on America\u2019s East Coast in the late Fifties.}}</ref><ref name=nyt2001 /><ref name=lennox /> The features of the WMCA smiley was a yellow face, with black dots as eyes and had a slightly crooked smile.

His rendition, with a bright yellow background, dark oval eyes, full smile, and creases at the sides of the mouth,<ref name=lennox/> was imprinted on more than fifty million buttons and became familiar around the world. The design is so simple that it is certain that similar versions were produced before 1963, including those cited above.

Tenagi's design was used in an advertising campaign for Seattle-based University Federal Savings & Loan. The ad campaign was inspired by [[Lee Adams]]'s lyrics in \"Put on a Happy Face\" from the musical ''[[Bye Bye Birdie]]''. Stern, the man behind this campaign, also later incorporated the Happy Face in his run for Seattle mayor in 1993.<ref name=\"Adams\"/>\n\nThe graphic was further popularized in the early 1970s by Philadelphia brothers Bernard and Murray Spain, who seized upon it in September 1970 in a campaign to sell novelty items. The two produced buttons as well as coffee mugs, [[t-shirts]], [[bumper stickers]] and many other items emblazoned with the symbol and the phrase \"Have a happy day\", which mutated into \"[[Have a nice day]]\". Working with New York button manufacturer NG Slater, some 50 million happy face badges were produced by 1972.<ref name=\"Peter Shapiro 2001, pp44-49\">Peter Shapiro, \"Smiling Faces Sometimes\", in ''The Wire'', issue 203, January 2001, pp. 44\u201349.</ref>\n\n===Evolution into the smiley===\nIn 1972, Frenchman Franklin Loufrani became the first person to legally [[trademark]] the use of a smiley face. He used it to highlight the good news parts of the newspaper ''[[France Soir]]''. He simply called the design \"Smiley\" and launched [[The Smiley Company]]. In 1996 Loufrani's son Nicolas Loufrani took over the family business and built it into a multinational corporation. Nicolas Loufrani was outwardly skeptical of Harvey Ball's claim to creating the first smiley face. While noting that the design that his father came up with and Ball's design were nearly identical, Loufrani argued that the design is so simple that no one person can lay claim to having created it. As evidence for this, Loufrani's website points to early cave paintings found in France (2500 BC) that he claims are the first depictions of a smiley face. Loufrani also points to a 1960 radio ad campaign that reportedly made use of a similar design.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/who-really-invented-the-smiley-face-2058483/?no-ist|title=Who Really Invented the Smiley Face?|author=Jimmy Stamp|work=Smithsonian}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Authentic Worcester-made smiley face, Harvey Ball.jpg|thumb|right|\"Authentic [[Hanover Insurance|Worcester]]-made smiley face\", by Harvey Ball]]\nThe rights to the Smiley trademark in one hundred countries are owned by the Smiley Company.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/05/business/worldbusiness/05smiley.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first=Thomas | last=Crampton | title=Smiley Face Is Serious to Company | date=July 5, 2006}}</ref> Its subsidiary SmileyWorld Ltd, in London, headed by Nicolas Loufrani, creates or approves all the Smiley products sold in countries where it holds the trademark.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_id/article/j5pyyb/the-man-who-owns-the-smiley-face|title=The Man Who Owns the Smiley Face|date=August 10, 2017|work=Vice|access-date=January 24, 2018|language=en-id}}</ref> The Smiley brand and logo have significant exposure through licensees in sectors such as clothing, home decoration, perfumery, plush, stationery, publishing, and through promotional campaigns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.licensing.biz/company-profiles/24/Smiley-Licensing |title=Smiley Licensing &#124; Company Profile by |website=Licensing.biz |accessdate=March 14, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229123013/http://www.licensing.biz/company-profiles/24/Smiley-Licensing |archivedate=February 29, 2012 }}</ref> The Smiley Company is one of the 100 biggest licensing companies in the world, with a turnover of US$167 million in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rankingthebrands.com/PDF/Top%20125%20Global%20Licensors%202011,%20License%20Global.pdf|format=PDF|title=Global License : Ranking the brands|website=Rankingthebrands.com|accessdate=September 21, 2018}}</ref> The first Smiley shop opened in London in the [[Boxpark]] shopping centre in December 2011.<ref>{{cite web |author=Giedrius Ivanauskas |url=http://madeinshoreditch.co.uk/2012/01/16/boxpark-shoreditch-interview-with-nicolas-loufrani-ceo-of-smiley/ |title=Boxpark Shoreditch: Interview with Nicolas Loufrani CEO of Smiley &#124; Made in Shoreditch - A Magazine About Style, Innovation, Dining, Nightlife and People in Shoreditch |publisher=Made in Shoreditch |date=January 16, 2012 |accessdate=March 14, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307075637/http://madeinshoreditch.co.uk/2012/01/16/boxpark-shoreditch-interview-with-nicolas-loufrani-ceo-of-smiley/ |archivedate=March 7, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, Franklin Loufrani and Smiley World attempted to acquire trademark rights to the symbol (and even to the word \"smiley\" itself) in the United States. This brought Loufrani into conflict with [[Wal-Mart]], which had begun prominently featuring a happy face in its \"Rolling Back Prices\" campaign over a year earlier. Wal-Mart responded first by trying to block Loufrani's application, then later by trying to register the smiley face itself; Loufrani, in turn, sued to stop Wal-Mart's application, and in 2002 after the issue went to court,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4984138.stm| date=May 8, 2006| title=Wal-Mart seeks smiley face rights| work=BBC News| accessdate=May 9, 2006}}</ref> where it would languish for seven years before a decision.\n\nWal-Mart began phasing out the smiley face on its vests<ref name=\" phase\">{{cite journal| first =Mark| last = Kabel| author-link =| coauthors =| date =October 22, 2006| title =Wal-Mart phasing out smiley face vests| journal = Associated Press| volume =| issue =| pages =| id =| URL =}}</ref> and its website<ref>{{cite journal| first =Richard| last =Williamson| author-link =| coauthors =| date = October 30, 2006| title = The last days of Wal-Mart's smiley face| journal = Adweek| volume =| issue =| pages =| id =| URL = http://adweek.blogs.com/adfreak/2006/10/the_last_days_o.html}}</ref> in 2006. Despite that, Wal-Mart sued an online parodist for alleged \"trademark infringement\" after he used the symbol (as well as various [[portmanteau]]s of \"Wal-\", such as \"Walocaust\"). The District Court found in favor of the parodist when in March 2008, the judge concluded that Wal-Mart's smiley face logo was not shown to be \"inherently distinctive\" and that it \"has failed to establish that the smiley face has acquired secondary meaning or that it is otherwise a protectable trademark\" under [[United States trademark law|U.S. law]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.citizen.org/litigation/forms/cases/getlinkforcase.cfm?cID=206| date=March 28, 2008| title=Smith v.

[[Yahoo! Messenger]] (from 1998) used smiley symbols in the user list next to each user, and also as an icon for the application. \nIn 2001, SmileyWorld launched the website \"The official Smiley dictionary\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010331043601/http://www.smileydictionary.com/|title=Wayback Machine|date=March 31, 2001|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=September 21, 2018}}</ref> with smileys proposed to replace ASCII emoticons (i.e. emojis). In November 2001, and later, smiley emojis inside the actual chat text was adopted by several chat systems, including Yahoo Messenger.\n\nThe smiley is the printable version of characters 1 and 2 of (black-and-white versions of) [[codepage 437]] (1981) of the first [[IBM PC]] and all subsequent PC compatible computers.

It is used for [[communication]], imagery, branding and for topical purposes to display a range of [[emotion]]s. Beginning in the 1960s, a yellow ''happy face'' was used by numerous brands in print to demonstrate happiness.\n\n===In print===\nFranklin Loufrani first introduced the word smiley when he designed a smiling face for the newspaper he was working for at the time. The Loufrani design came in 1971, when Loufrani designed a smiley face for the newspaper, ''[[France-Soir]]''. The newspaper used Loufrani's smiley to highlight stories that they defined as ''\"feel-good news.\"''<ref name=vice>{{cite web |last1=Golby |first1=Joel |title=The Man Who Owns the Smiley Face |url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/j5pyyb/the-man-who-owns-the-smiley-face |publisher=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] |date=August 9, 2017}}</ref> This particular smiley went onto form [[The Smiley Company]]. [[Mad (magazine)|''Mad'']] magazine notably used the smiley a year later in 1972 across their entire front page for the April edition of the magazine. This was one of the first instances that the smiling face had been adapted, with one of the twenty visible smileys pulling a face.<ref>{{cite news |title=Front cover of Mad |issue=150 |publisher=[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]] |date=April 1972 |pages=1}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[United States]], there were many instances of smiling faces in the 1900s. However, the first industry to mass adopt the smiley was in [[comics]] and cartoons.\n\n===Music===\nAs music genres began to create their own cultures from the 1970s onwards, many cultures began to incorporate a smiling face into their culture. In the late 1970s, the [[United States|American]] band [[Dead Kennedys]] launched their first recording, \"[[California \u00dcber Alles]]\". The single cover was a collage aimed to look like that of a [[Nazi]] rally prior to [[World War II]]. The usual [[swastika]] banners used at rallies, was replaced on the single cover with three large smileys.<ref>Johnson, Heather. \"[http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_dead_kennedys/index.html Dead Kennedys' 'California Uber Alles'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110093019/http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_dead_kennedys/index.html |date=2014-11-10 }}\". ''[[Mix Online]]''. October 1, 2005.</ref> In the UK, the happy face has been associated with [[psychedelic culture]] since [[Ubi Dwyer]] and the [[Windsor Free Festival]] in the 1970s and the [[electronic dance music]] culture, particularly with [[acid house]], that emerged during the [[Second Summer of Love]] in the late 1980s. The association was cemented when the band [[Bomb the Bass]] used an extracted smiley from the comic book series ''[[Watchmen]]'' on the center of its \"[[Beat Dis]]\" hit single.\n\n[[File:Watchmen-smiley.svg|thumb|The ''[[Watchmen]]'' comic series logo]]\n\nIn the late-1980s, the smiley again became a prominent image within the [[music industry]]. It was adopted during the growth of [[acid house]] across [[Europe]] and the UK in the late 1980s. According to many, this began when DJ, [[Danny Rampling]], used the smiley to celebrate [[Paul Oakenfold]]'s birthday.<ref>{{cite web |title=The strange, tangled history of the acid house smiley |url=https://www.redbull.com/gb-en/history-of-the-acid-house-smiley |publisher=[[Red Bull]]}}</ref> This sparked a movement where the smiley moved into various dance genres, becoming a symbol of 1980s dance music.<ref>{{cite web |title=Acid History: How The Smiley Became The Iconic Face Of Rave |url=https://www.electronicbeats.net/the-feed/untold-history-rave-smiley/ |publisher=ElectronicBeats magazine}}</ref>\n\n===Gaming===\nIn 1980, [[Namco]] released the now famous [[Pac-man]], a yellow faced cartoon character. In 2008, the video game [[Battlefield: Bad Company]] used the yellow smiley as part of its branding for the game. The smiley appeared throughout the game and also on the cover. The smiley normally appeared on the side of a grenade, which is something that became synonymous with the Battlefield series.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hands-on: Battlefield - Bad Company |url=https://www.wired.com/2008/02/hands-on-battle/ |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)]] |date=February 28, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Film===\nThe logo for the ''[[Watchmen]]'' comic book series includes a smiley with blood on top of it.

The first of his major works that included a smiley was his Flying Copper portrait, which was completed in 2004. It was during a period when Banksy experimented with working on canvas and paper portraits. He also used the smiley in 2005 to replace the face of the [[grim reaper]].

Although the proposals were immediately laid before [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] they were not brought forward by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|Government]] for approval. Accordingly, they '''did''' '''not''' come into effect for the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 election]] which took place on 12 December 2019, and which was contested using the constituency boundaries in place since 2010.\n\nUnder the terms of the [[Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011]], the Sixth Review was based on reducing the total number of MPs from 650 to 600 and a strict electoral parity requirement that the electorate of all constituencies should be within a range of 5% either side of the electoral quota.\n\nOn 24 March 2020, the Minister of State for the [[Cabinet Office]], [[Chloe Smith]], issued a written statement to Parliament setting out the Government's thinking with regard to parliamentary boundaries. They propose to bring forward [[Primary and secondary legislation|primary legislation]] to remove the statutory obligation to implement the 2018 Boundary Review recommendations, as well as set the framework for future boundary reviews in time for the next review which is due to begin in early 2021 and report no later than October 2023. It is proposed that the number of constituencies now remains at the current level of 650, rather than being reduced to 600, while retaining the requirement that the electorate should be no more than +/- 5% from the electoral quota.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Commons/2020-03-24/HCWS183/|title=Update: Strengthening Democracy:Written statement - HCWS183|website=UK Parliament|language=English|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\n==Historical representation by party==\nA cell marked \u2192 (with a different colour background to the preceding cell) indicates that the previous MP continued to sit under a new party name.\n\n===1885 to 1918===\n{{legend2|{{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}|[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]|border=1px solid #aaaaaa}}\n{{legend2|{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}|[[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]|border=1px solid #aaaaaa}}\n{{legend2|{{Liberal Party (UK)/meta/color}}|[[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]]|border=1px solid #aaaaaa}}\n{{legend2|{{Liberal-Labour/meta/color}}|[[Liberal-Labour (UK)|Liberal-Labour]]|border=1px solid #aaaaaa}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Constituency\n!1885\n!1886\n!1892\n!1895\n!1900\n!''01''\n!''04''\n!1906\n!Jan 1910\n!Dec 1910\n!''17''\n|-\n|[[Monmouth Boroughs (UK Parliament constituency)|Monmouth Boroughs]]\n| bgcolor=\"{{Liberal Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |[[Sir Edward Carbutt, 1st Baronet|Carbutt]]\n| bgcolor=\"{{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |[[Sir George Elliot, 1st Baronet|Elliot]]\n| colspan=\"2\" bgcolor=\"{{Liberal Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |[[Albert Spicer|Spicer]]\n| bgcolor=\"{{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |[[Frederick Rutherfoord Harris|Harris]]\n| bgcolor=\"{{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" colspan=\"2\" |[[Joseph Lawrence (British politician)|Lawrence]]\n| colspan=\"4\" bgcolor=\"{{Liberal Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |[[Lewis Haslam|Haslam]]\n|-\n|[[North Monmouthshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Monmouthshire North]]\n| colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"{{Liberal Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |[[Thomas Phillips Price|Price]]\n| colspan=\"8\" bgcolor=\"{{Liberal Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |[[Reginald McKenna|McKenna]]\n|-\n|[[South Monmouthshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Monmouthshire South]]\n| bgcolor=\"{{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" colspan=\"7\" |[[Frederick Courtenay Morgan|Morgan]]\n| colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"{{Liberal Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |[[Ivor Treowen, 1st Baron Treowen|Herbert]]\n|bgcolor=\"{{Liberal Party (UK)/meta/color}}\"|[[Abraham Garrod Thomas|Thomas]]\n|-\n|[[West Monmouthshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Monmouthshire West]]\n| colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"{{Liberal Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |[[Sir Marshall Warmington, 1st Baronet|Warmington]]\n| colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"{{Liberal Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |[[William Vernon Harcourt (politician)|Harcourt]]\n| colspan=\"2\" bgcolor=\"{{Liberal-Labour/meta/color}}\"|[[Thomas Richards (Welsh politician)|Richards]]\n| bgcolor=\"{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" colspan=\"3\" |[[Thomas Richards (Welsh politician)|\u2192]]\n|}\n\n===1918 to 1983===\n{{legend2|{{Coalition Liberal/meta/color}}|[[Coalition Liberal]] (1918-22) / [[National Liberal Party (UK, 1922)|National Liberal]] (1922-23)|border=1px solid #aaaaaa}}\n{{legend2|{{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}|[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]|border=1px solid #aaaaaa}}\n{{legend2|{{Independent Labour/meta/color}}|[[Independent Labour]]|border=1px solid #aaaaaa}}\n{{legend2|{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}|[[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]|border=1px solid #aaaaaa}}\n{{legend2|{{Social Democratic Party (UK)/meta/color}}|[[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic]]|border=1px solid #aaaaaa}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Constituency\n!1918\n!''20''\n!''22''\n!1922\n!1923\n!1924\n!1929\n!1931\n!''34''\n!1935\n!''39''\n!''40''\n!''45''\n!1945\n!''45''\n!''46''\n!1950\n!''50''\n!1951\n!1955\n!''56''\n!''58''\n!1959\n!''60''\n!1964\n!''65''\n!1966\n!1970\n!Feb 74\n!Oct 74\n!1979\n!''81''\n|-\n|[[Abertillery (UK Parliament constituency)|Abertillery]]\n| bgcolor=\"{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |[[William Brace|Brace]]\n| bgcolor=\"{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" colspan=\"5\" |[[George Barker (Welsh politician)|Barker]]\n| bgcolor=\"{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" colspan=\"11\" |[[George Daggar|Daggar]]\n| bgcolor=\"{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" colspan=\"8\" |[[Llywelyn Williams|L.

Although the proposals were immediately laid before [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] they were not brought forward by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|Government]] for approval. Accordingly, they '''did''' '''not''' come into effect for the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 election]] which took place on 12 December 2019, and which was contested using the constituency boundaries in place since 2010.\n\nUnder the terms of the [[Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011]], the Sixth Review was based on reducing the total number of MPs from 650 to 600 and a strict electoral parity requirement that the electorate of all constituencies should be within a range of 5% either side of the electoral quota.\n\nOn 24 March 2020, the Minister of State for the [[Cabinet Office]], [[Chloe Smith]], issued a written statement to Parliament setting out the Government's thinking with regard to parliamentary boundaries. They propose to bring forward [[Primary and secondary legislation|primary legislation]] to remove the statutory obligation to implement the 2018 Boundary Review recommendations, as well as set the framework for future boundary reviews in time for the next review which is due to begin in early 2021 and report no later than October 2023. It is proposed that the number of constituencies now remains at the current level of 650, rather than being reduced to 600, while retaining the requirement that the electorate should be no more than +/- 5% from the electoral quota.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Commons/2020-03-24/HCWS183/|title=Update: Strengthening Democracy:Written statement - HCWS183|website=UK Parliament|language=English|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\n==Historical representation by party==\nA cell marked \u2192 (with a different colour background to the preceding cell) indicates that the previous MP continued to sit under a new party name.\n\n===1885 to 1918===\n{{legend2|{{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}|[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]|border=1px solid #aaaaaa}}\n{{legend2|{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}|[[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]|border=1px solid #aaaaaa}}\n{{legend2|{{Liberal Party (UK)/meta/color}}|[[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]]|border=1px solid #aaaaaa}}\n{{legend2|{{Liberal-Labour/meta/color}}|[[Liberal-Labour (UK)|Liberal-Labour]]|border=1px solid #aaaaaa}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Constituency\n!1885\n!1886\n!1892\n!1895\n!1900\n!''01''\n!''04''\n!1906\n!Jan 1910\n!Dec 1910\n!''17''\n|-\n|[[Monmouth Boroughs (UK Parliament constituency)|Monmouth Boroughs]]\n| bgcolor=\"{{Liberal Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |[[Sir Edward Carbutt, 1st Baronet|Carbutt]]\n| bgcolor=\"{{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |[[Sir George Elliot, 1st Baronet|Elliot]]\n| colspan=\"2\" bgcolor=\"{{Liberal Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |[[Albert Spicer|Spicer]]\n| bgcolor=\"{{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |[[Frederick Rutherfoord Harris|Harris]]\n| bgcolor=\"{{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" colspan=\"2\" |[[Joseph Lawrence (British politician)|Lawrence]]\n| colspan=\"4\" bgcolor=\"{{Liberal Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |[[Lewis Haslam|Haslam]]\n|-\n|[[North Monmouthshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Monmouthshire North]]\n| colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"{{Liberal Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |[[Thomas Phillips Price|Price]]\n| colspan=\"8\" bgcolor=\"{{Liberal Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |[[Reginald McKenna|McKenna]]\n|-\n|[[South Monmouthshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Monmouthshire South]]\n| bgcolor=\"{{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" colspan=\"7\" |[[Frederick Courtenay Morgan|Morgan]]\n| colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"{{Liberal Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |[[Ivor Treowen, 1st Baron Treowen|Herbert]]\n|bgcolor=\"{{Liberal Party (UK)/meta/color}}\"|[[Abraham Garrod Thomas|Thomas]]\n|-\n|[[West Monmouthshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Monmouthshire West]]\n| colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"{{Liberal Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |[[Sir Marshall Warmington, 1st Baronet|Warmington]]\n| colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"{{Liberal Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |[[William Vernon Harcourt (politician)|Harcourt]]\n| colspan=\"2\" bgcolor=\"{{Liberal-Labour/meta/color}}\"|[[Thomas Richards (Welsh politician)|Richards]]\n| bgcolor=\"{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" colspan=\"3\" |[[Thomas Richards (Welsh politician)|\u2192]]\n|}\n\n===1918 to 1983===\n{{legend2|{{Coalition Liberal/meta/color}}|[[Coalition Liberal]] (1918-22) / [[National Liberal Party (UK, 1922)|National Liberal]] (1922-23)|border=1px solid #aaaaaa}}\n{{legend2|{{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}|[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]|border=1px solid #aaaaaa}}\n{{legend2|{{Independent Labour/meta/color}}|[[Independent Labour]]|border=1px solid #aaaaaa}}\n{{legend2|{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}|[[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]|border=1px solid #aaaaaa}}\n{{legend2|{{Social Democratic Party (UK)/meta/color}}|[[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic]]|border=1px solid #aaaaaa}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Constituency\n!1918\n!''20''\n!''22''\n!1922\n!1923\n!1924\n!1929\n!1931\n!''34''\n!1935\n!''39''\n!''40''\n!''45''\n!1945\n!''45''\n!''46''\n!1950\n!''50''\n!1951\n!1955\n!''56''\n!''58''\n!1959\n!''60''\n!1964\n!''65''\n!1966\n!1970\n!Feb 74\n!Oct 74\n!1979\n!''81''\n|-\n|[[Abertillery (UK Parliament constituency)|Abertillery]]\n| bgcolor=\"{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |[[William Brace|Brace]]\n| bgcolor=\"{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" colspan=\"5\" |[[George Barker (Welsh politician)|Barker]]\n| bgcolor=\"{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" colspan=\"11\" |[[George Daggar|Daggar]]\n| bgcolor=\"{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" colspan=\"8\" |[[Llywelyn Williams|L.

In 1955, the museum moved to its current location on Union Avenue near [[Saratoga Race Course|Saratoga race course]], at which time inductions into the hall of fame began. Each spring, following the tabulation of the final votes, the announcement of new inductees is made, usually during [[Kentucky Derby]] Week in early May. The actual inductions are held in mid-August during the [[Saratoga Race Course|Saratoga]] race meeting.\n\nThe Hall of Fame's nominating committee selects eight to ten candidates from among the four Contemporary categories (male horse, female horse, jockey and trainer) to be presented to the voters. Changes in voting procedures that commenced with the 2010 candidates allow the voters to choose multiple candidates from a single Contemporary category, instead of a single candidate from each of the four Contemporary categories.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/sports/horse/news/story?id=4962597|title=Racing Hall of Fame changes voting procedures|date=3 March 2010|website=ESPN.com}}</ref> For example, in 2016, two female horses (Rachel Alexandra and Zenyatta) were inducted at the same time.\n\nThe museum also houses a large collection of art, artifacts, and memorabilia that document the history of horse racing from the eighteenth century to the present.\n\n==History==\nThe museum first opened its doors in 1951, at which time it occupied a single room in Saratoga's [[Canfield Casino]]. The establishment was supported by the city of [[Saratoga Springs]], which donated $2,500, the Saratoga Racing Association, which donated $5,000, and various patrons of the sport, who also donated various pieces of art and memorabilia. The first item in the museum's collection was a horseshoe worn by the great [[Lexington (horse)|Lexington]].<ref name=\"EvolvedPt1\">{{cite web |last1=Goode |first1=Kristen Ingwell |title=Racing's Hall of Fame Evolved From Humble Beginnings |url=https://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/192192/racings-hall-of-fame-evolved-from-humble-beginnings |website=BloodHorse.com |accessdate=9 September 2018 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 1955, the museum relocated to its current location on Union Avenue, close to the main entrance of [[Saratoga Race Course]]. Inductions into the hall of fame began at the same time. Since then, the museum has expanded several times to allow for the display of its extensive art collection and more multimedia displays on the history of the sport.<ref name=EvolvedPt1 />\n\n==Horses in the Hall of Fame==\n[[File:HorseracingHallofFame.jpg|thumb|The Hall of Fame gallery at the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in Saratoga]]\nIn the early years, inductions to the hall of fame were based on the evaluation of a panel of racing historians. In 1955, a group of 9 horses from the earliest years of the American turf were inducted.<ref name=\"EvolvedPt2\">{{cite web |title=Hall of Fame: Humble Beginnings (Cont.) |url=https://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/192191/hall-of-fame-humble-beginnings-cont |website=BloodHorse.com |accessdate=9 September 2018 |language=en}}</ref> The 1956 class included 11 horses that raced around the turn of the century, while the 1957 class included 10 horses that raced up to the mid-thirties. Since then, the classes have been significantly smaller as the inductions shifted to more contemporary horses. Under current rules, a horse must have been retired for a minimum of five full calendar years to be eligible for the hall of fame. Thoroughbreds remain eligible in the contemporary category between five and 25 calendar years following their final racing year. Thoroughbreds retired for more than 25 calendar years may become eligible through the Historic Review Committee.<ref name=EvolvedPt1 /><ref name=Eligibility>{{cite web|title=Eligibility, Nomination and Election - National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame|url=https://www.racingmuseum.org/eligibility-nomination-and-election|website=www.racingmuseum.org|accessdate=4 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" \n|-\n!Photo!!Name!!Inducted!!Career Years!!Starts!!Wins\n|-\n| [[File:1992APIndy (2).jpg|100px]]||[[A.P.

In 1955, the museum moved to its current location on Union Avenue near [[Saratoga Race Course|Saratoga race course]], at which time inductions into the hall of fame began. Each spring, following the tabulation of the final votes, the announcement of new inductees is made, usually during [[Kentucky Derby]] Week in early May. The actual inductions are held in mid-August during the [[Saratoga Race Course|Saratoga]] race meeting.\n\nThe Hall of Fame's nominating committee selects eight to ten candidates from among the four Contemporary categories (male horse, female horse, jockey and trainer) to be presented to the voters. Changes in voting procedures that commenced with the 2010 candidates allow the voters to choose multiple candidates from a single Contemporary category, instead of a single candidate from each of the four Contemporary categories.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/sports/horse/news/story?id=4962597|title=Racing Hall of Fame changes voting procedures|date=3 March 2010|website=ESPN.com}}</ref> For example, in 2016, two female horses (Rachel Alexandra and Zenyatta) were inducted at the same time.\n\nThe museum also houses a large collection of art, artifacts, and memorabilia that document the history of horse racing from the eighteenth century to the present.\n\n==History==\nThe museum first opened its doors in 1951, at which time it occupied a single room in Saratoga's [[Canfield Casino]]. The establishment was supported by the city of [[Saratoga Springs]], which donated $2,500, the Saratoga Racing Association, which donated $5,000, and various patrons of the sport, who also donated various pieces of art and memorabilia. The first item in the museum's collection was a horseshoe worn by the great [[Lexington (horse)|Lexington]].<ref name=\"EvolvedPt1\">{{cite web |last1=Goode |first1=Kristen Ingwell |title=Racing's Hall of Fame Evolved From Humble Beginnings |url=https://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/192192/racings-hall-of-fame-evolved-from-humble-beginnings |website=BloodHorse.com |accessdate=9 September 2018 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 1955, the museum relocated to its current location on Union Avenue, close to the main entrance of [[Saratoga Race Course]]. Inductions into the hall of fame began at the same time. Since then, the museum has expanded several times to allow for the display of its extensive art collection and more multimedia displays on the history of the sport.<ref name=EvolvedPt1 />\n\n==Horses in the Hall of Fame==\n[[File:HorseracingHallofFame.jpg|thumb|The Hall of Fame gallery at the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in Saratoga]]\nIn the early years, inductions to the hall of fame were based on the evaluation of a panel of racing historians. In 1955, a group of 9 horses from the earliest years of the American turf were inducted.<ref name=\"EvolvedPt2\">{{cite web |title=Hall of Fame: Humble Beginnings (Cont.) |url=https://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/192191/hall-of-fame-humble-beginnings-cont |website=BloodHorse.com |accessdate=9 September 2018 |language=en}}</ref> The 1956 class included 11 horses that raced around the turn of the century, while the 1957 class included 10 horses that raced up to the mid-thirties. Since then, the classes have been significantly smaller as the inductions shifted to more contemporary horses. Under current rules, a horse must have been retired for a minimum of five full calendar years to be eligible for the hall of fame. Thoroughbreds remain eligible in the contemporary category between five and 25 calendar years following their final racing year. Thoroughbreds retired for more than 25 calendar years may become eligible through the Historic Review Committee.<ref name=EvolvedPt1 /><ref name=Eligibility>{{cite web|title=Eligibility, Nomination and Election - National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame|url=https://www.racingmuseum.org/eligibility-nomination-and-election|website=www.racingmuseum.org|accessdate=4 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" \n|-\n!Photo!!Name!!Inducted!!Career Years!!Starts!!Wins\n|-\n| [[File:1992APIndy (2).jpg|100px]]||[[A.P.

He was beheaded at Plaine Verte on 15 April 1822, and his head was displayed as a deterrent against future uprisings among the slaves.<ref name=\"Selvon\">''A New Comprehensive History of Mauritius'', Sydney Selvon, 2012. {{ISBN|978-99949-34-91-1}}</ref>\n\nIn 1832, Adrien d'\u00c9pinay launched the first Mauritian newspaper (''Le Cern\u00e9en''), which was not controlled by the government. In the same year, there was a move by the procureur-general to abolish slavery without compensation to the slave owners. This gave rise to discontent, and, to check an eventual rebellion, the government ordered all the inhabitants to surrender their arms. Furthermore, a stone fortress, Fort Adelaide, was built on a hill (now known as the Citadel hill) in the centre of Port Louis to quell any uprising.<ref name=\"Toussaint2\"/>\n\n[[Slavery]] was abolished in 1835, and the planters ultimately received two million pounds sterling in compensation for the loss of their slaves, who had been imported from Africa and Madagascar during the French occupation. The [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolition of slavery]] had important impacts on Mauritius's society, economy and population. The planters brought a large number of [[Indentured servant|indentured labourers]] from India to work in the sugar cane fields. Between 1834 and 1921, around half a million indentured labourers were present on the island. They worked on sugar estates, factories, in transport and on construction sites. Additionally, the British brought 8,740 [[Indian people|Indian]] soldiers to the island.<ref name=\"govt\"/> [[Aapravasi Ghat]], in the bay at [[Port Louis]] and now a [[UNESCO]] site, was the first British [[colony]] to serve as a major reception centre for [[indentured servants]].\n\nAn important figure of the 19th century was R\u00e9my Ollier, a journalist of mixed origin. In 1828, the colour bar was officially abolished in Mauritius, but British governors gave little power to coloured persons, and appointed only whites as leading officials. R\u00e9my Ollier petitioned to [[Queen Victoria]] to allow coloureds in the council of government, and this became possible a few years later. He also made Port Louis become a municipality so that the citizens could administer the town through their own elected representatives. A street has been named after him in Port Louis, and his bust was erected in the Jardin de la Compagnie in 1906.<ref name=\"Toussaint\"/> In 1885 [[Constitution of Mauritius (1885)|a new constitution]] was introduced to Mauritius. It created elected positions on the governing council, but the franchise was restricted mainly to the French and Creole classes.\n\n[[File:Numa Desjardins Champ de Mars Port Louis 1880.jpg|thumb|left|[[Champ de Mars Racecourse]], Port Louis, 1880]]\n\nThe labourers brought from India were not always fairly treated, and a German, Adolph von Plevitz, made himself the unofficial protector of these immigrants. He mixed with many of the labourers, and in 1871 helped them to write a petition that was sent to [[Arthur Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Baron Stanmore|Governor Gordon]]. A commission was appointed to look into the complaints made by the Indian immigrants, and in 1872 two lawyers, appointed by the British Crown, were sent from England to make an inquiry. This Royal Commission recommended several measures that would affect the lives of Indian labourers during the next fifty years.<ref name=\"Toussaint\"/>\n\nIn November 1901, [[Mahatma Gandhi]] visited Mauritius, on his way from South Africa to India. He stayed on the island for two weeks, and urged the Indo-Mauritian community to take an interest in education and to play a more active role in politics. Back in India, he sent over a young lawyer, [[Manilal Doctor]], to improve the plight of the Indo-Mauritians. During the same year, faster links were established with the island of Rodrigues thanks to the wireless.<ref name=\"Dinan\">''Mauritius in the making across the censuses 1846\u20132000'', Monique Dinan. {{ISBN|99903-904-6-0}}</ref>\n\nIn 1903, motorcars were introduced in Mauritius, and in 1910 the first taxis, operated by Joseph Merven, came into service. The electrification of Port Louis took place in 1909, and in the same decade the Mauritius Hydro Electric Company (managed by the Atchia Brothers) was authorised to provide power to the towns of upper Plaines Wilhems.\n\n[[File:The web of empire - a diary of the imperial tour of their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York in 1901 (1902) (14763807672).jpg|thumb|Duke and Duchess of [[Duchy of Cornwall|Cornwall]] and [[Duke of York|York]] in Mauritius, 1901]]\nThe 1910s were a period of political agitation. The rising middle class (made up of doctors, lawyers, and teachers) began to challenge the political power of the sugar cane landowners. Dr. Eug\u00e8ne Laurent, mayor of Port Louis, was the leader of this new group; his party, Action Lib\u00e9rale, demanded that more people should be allowed to vote in the elections. Action Lib\u00e9rale was opposed by the Parti de l'Ordre, led by Henri Lecl\u00e9zio, the most influential of the sugar magnates.<ref name=\"Toussaint\"/> In 1911 there were riots in Port Louis due to a false rumour that Dr. Eug\u00e8ne Laurent had been murdered by the oligarchs in Curepipe. Shops and offices were damaged in the capital, and one person was killed. In the same year, 1911, the first public cinema shows took place in Curepipe, and, in the same town, a stone building was erected to house the Royal College.<ref name=\"Dinan\"/> In 1912, a wider telephone network came into service, used by the government, business firms, and a few private households.\n\n[[World War I]] broke out in August 1914. Many Mauritians volunteered to fight in Europe against the Germans and in [[Mesopotamia]] against the Turks. But the war affected Mauritius much less than the wars of the eighteenth century. In fact, the 1914\u20131918 war was a period of great prosperity due to a boom in sugar prices. In 1919 the Mauritius Sugar Syndicate came into being, which included 70% of all sugar producers.\n\nThe 1920s saw the rise of a \"retrocessionism\" movement, which favoured the retrocession of Mauritius to France. The movement rapidly collapsed because none of the candidates who wanted Mauritius to be given back to France were elected in the 1921 elections. In the post-war recession, there was a sharp drop in sugar prices. Many sugar estates closed down, marking the end of an era for the sugar magnates who had not only controlled the economy but also the political life of the country. Raoul Rivet, the editor of ''Le Mauricien'' newspaper, campaigned for a revision of the constitution that would give the emerging middle class a greater role in the running of the country. The principles of [[Arya Samaj]] began to infiltrate the Hindu community, who clamoured for more social justice.<ref name=\"Dinan\"/>\n\nThe 1930s saw the birth of the [[Labour Party (Mauritius)|Labour Party]], launched by Dr. Maurice Cur\u00e9. [[Emmanuel Anquetil]] rallied the urban workers while Pandit Sahadeo concentrated on the rural working class. The [[Uba riots of 1937]] resulted in reforms by the local British government that improved labour conditions and led to the un-banning of labour unions.<ref name=\"js\">{{Cite journal|title=Small-Scale Sugar Cane Farmers and Biotechnology in Mauritius: The \"Uba\" Riots of 1937 |journal = Agricultural History|volume = 69|issue = 2|last=Storey |first=William Kelleher |date=1995 |pages=163\u2013176 |jstor = 3744263}}</ref><ref name=\"rg\">{{Cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258935447 |title=Mauritius 1937: The Origins of a Milestone in Colonial Trade Union Legislation |journal=Labor History |volume=54 |issue=3 |last=Croucher |first=Richard |last2=Mcilroy |first2=John |date=2013-07-01 |pages=223\u2013239 |doi=10.1080/0023656X.2013.804268 |access-date=2018-08-18}}</ref> Labour Day was celebrated for the first time in 1938.

Some went to England to become pilots and ground staff in the [[Royal Air Force]]. Mauritius was never really threatened but several British ships were sunk outside Port Louis by German submarines in 1943.\n\nDuring World War II, conditions were hard in the country; the prices of commodities doubled but workers\u2019 salaries increased only by 10 to 20 percent. There was civil unrest, and the colonial government crushed all trade union activities. However, the labourers of Belle Vue Harel Sugar Estate went on strike on 27 September 1943. Police officers eventually fired on the crowd, and killed three labourers including a boy of ten and a pregnant woman, Anjaly Coopen.<ref>''Our Struggle, 20th Century Mauritius'', Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, Anand Mulloo</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lexpress.mu/node/203804/| title=The historical significance of Anjalay Coopen|website=[[L'Express (Mauritius)|L'Express]]|accessdate=22 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe first general elections were held on 9 August 1948 and were won by the Labour Party. This party, led by Guy Rozemont, bettered its position in 1953, and, on the strength of the election results, demanded [[universal suffrage]]. Constitutional conferences were held in London in 1955 and 1957, and the ministerial system was introduced. Voting took place for the first time on the basis of universal adult suffrage on 9 March 1959. The general election was again won by the Labour Party, led this time by [[Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam]].<ref name=ram>{{cite news|title=Histoire: Mauritius Independence 1961\u20131968|url=http://www.lemauricien.com/article/histoire-mauritius-independence-1961-1968|accessdate=9 September 2014|newspaper=Le Mauricien=9 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nA Constitutional Review Conference was held in London in 1961, and a programme of further constitutional advance was established. The 1963 election was won by the Labour Party and its allies. The [[Colonial Office]] noted that politics of a communal nature was gaining ground in Mauritius and that the choice of candidates (by parties) and the voting behaviour (of electors) were governed by ethnic and caste considerations.<ref name=ram/> Around that time, two eminent British academics, [[Richard Titmuss]] and [[James Meade]], published a report of the island's social problems caused by overpopulation and the monoculture of sugar cane. This led to an intense campaign to halt the population explosion, and the decade registered a sharp decline in population growth.\n\n===Independence (since 1968)===\n{{main|Mauritius (1968\u20131992)}}\nAt the Lancaster Conference of 1965, it became clear that Britain wanted to relieve itself of the colony of Mauritius. In 1959, [[Harold Macmillan]] had made his famous ''[[Wind of Change (speech)|Winds of Change Speech]]'' where he acknowledged that the best option for Britain was to give complete independence to its colonies. Thus, since the late Fifties, the way was paved for independence.<ref>{{cite news|title=Why independence was irresistible (by Anand Moheeputh)|url=http://www.lexpress.mu/node/243359/|newspaper=L'Express|date=12 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nLater in 1965, after the Lancaster Conference, the [[Chagos Archipelago]] was excised from the territory of Mauritius to form the [[British Indian Ocean Territory]] (BIOT). A general election took place on 7 August 1967, and the Labour Party and its two allies obtained the majority of seats. In January 1968, six weeks before the declaration of independence the [[1968 Mauritian riots]] occurred in Port Louis leading to the deaths of 25 people.<ref name=\"mg\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.mauritiusmag.com/?p=598 |title=An eye witness account of the 1968 riots |website=www.mauritiusmag.com |language=en-US |access-date=2018-08-15}}</ref><ref name=\"eisa\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.eisa.org.za/wep/mauoverview7.htm |title=EISA Mauritius: The road to independence (1945\u20131968) |website=www.eisa.org.za |access-date=2018-08-15}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Stamp Mauritius 1954 5c.jpg|thumb|190px|[[Elizabeth II]] was [[Queen of Mauritius]] from 1968 to 1992.]]\nMauritius adopted a new constitution and independence was proclaimed on 12 March 1968.

In 1969, the opposition party [[Mauritian Militant Movement]] (MMM) led by [[Paul B\u00e9renger]] was founded. Later in 1971, the MMM, backed by unions, called a series of strikes in the port, which caused a state of emergency in the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13882731|publisher=BBC|title=Mauritius profile|accessdate=27 November 2012}}</ref> The coalition government of the Labour Party and the PMSD (Parti Mauricien Social D\u00e9mocrate) reacted by curtailing civil liberties and curbing freedom of the press.<ref name=\"Dinan\"/> Two unsuccessful assassination attempts were made against Paul B\u00e9renger.

However, ideological and personality differences emerged within the MMM leadership. The power struggle between B\u00e9renger and Jugnauth peaked in March 1983. Jugnauth travelled to New Delhi to attend a [[Non-Aligned Movement]] summit; on his return, B\u00e9renger proposed constitutional changes that would strip power from the Prime Minister.

Industrialisation began to spread to villages as well, and attracted young workers from all ethnic communities. As a result, the sugar industry began to lose its hold on the economy. Large retail chains began opening stores in 1985 and offered credit facilities to low-income earners, thus allowing them to afford basic household appliances. There was also a boom in the tourism industry, and new hotels sprang up throughout the island.

As early as 1984, there was discontent. Through the ''Newspapers and Periodicals Amendment Act'', the government tried to make every newspaper provide a bank guarantee of half a million rupees. Forty-three journalists protested by participating in a public demonstration in Port Louis, in front of Parliament. They were arrested and freed on bail.

However, article 36 of the International Court of Justice Statute provides that it is the option of the state whether it wishes to subject itself to the court's jurisdiction. Where the state chooses to be so bound, it may also restrict or limit the jurisdiction of the court in a number of ways. The UK's clause deposited at the court excluded, amongst other things, the jurisdiction of the court with regard \"to any disputes with the government of any country which is a member of the Commonwealth with regard to situations or facts existing before 1 January 1969\". The temporal limitation of 1 January 1969 was inserted to exclude all disputes arising during decolonisation. The effect of the British exclusionary clause would thus have prevented Mauritius from resorting to the court on the Chagos dispute because it is a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. When Mauritius threatened to leave the Commonwealth, the United Kingdom quickly amended its exclusion clause to exclude any disputes between itself, Commonwealth States and ''former Commonwealth States'', thereby quashing any Mauritian hopes to ever have recourse to the contentious jurisdiction of the court, even if it left.<ref name=\"commonwealth\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.mauritiustimes.com/mt/vimalen-reddi/ |title=The Chagos Dispute: Also Giving Law A Chance |last=Reddi |first=Vimalen |access-date=2019-02-26}}</ref>\n\n=====Advisory opinion=====\nOn 22 June 2017, by a margin of 94 to 15 countries, the [[UN General Assembly]] asked the [[International Court of Justice]] to give an advisory opinion on the separation of the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritius before the country's independence in the 1960s.

The political party or alliance which has the second largest majority forms the Official Opposition and its leader is normally nominated by the President of the Republic as the Leader of the Opposition. The Assembly elects a Speaker, a Deputy Speaker and a Deputy Chairman of Committees as some of its first tasks.\n\nMauritius is a democracy with a government elected every five years. The most recent National Assembly Election was held on 10 December 2014 in all the 20 mainland constituencies, and in the constituency covering the island of Rodrigues.

Considered part of Africa geographically, Mauritius has friendly relations with African states in the region, particularly South Africa, by far its largest continental trading partner. Mauritian investors are gradually entering African markets, notably Madagascar, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. The country's political heritage and dependence on Western markets have led to close ties with the [[European Union]] and its member states, particularly France. Relations with India is very strong for both historical and commercial reasons. Mauritius established diplomatic relations with China in April 1972 and was forced to defend this decision, along with naval contracts with the USSR in the same year.\n\nMauritius is a member of the [[World Trade Organization]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], [[La Francophonie]], the [[African Union]], the [[Southern Africa Development Community]] (SADC), the [[Indian Ocean Commission]], [[COMESA]], and formed the [[Indian Ocean Rim Association]].\n\n==Legal system==\nMauritius has an hybrid legal system derives from [[British common law]] and the [[French civil law]]. The [[Constitution of Mauritius]] established the [[separation of powers]] between the [[legislature]], the [[Executive (government)|executive]] and the [[judiciary]] and guaranteed the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual. Mauritius has a single-structured judicial system consisting of two tiers, the [[Supreme Court of Mauritius|Supreme Court]] and subordinate courts. The Supreme Court is composed of various divisions exercising jurisdiction such as the Master's Court, the Family Division, the Commercial Division (Bankruptcy), the Criminal Division, the Mediation Division, the Court of First Instance in civil and criminal proceedings, the Appellate jurisdiction: the Court of Civil Appeal and the Court of Criminal Appeal. Subordinate courts consist of the Intermediate Court, the Industrial Court, the District Courts, the Bail and Remand Court and the Court of Rodrigues. The [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] is the final court of appeal of Mauritius. After the independence of Mauritius in 1968, Mauritius maintained the Privy Council as its highest court of appeal. Appeals to the Judicial Committee from decisions of the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court may be as of right or with the leave of the Court, as set out in section 81 of the Constitution and section 70A of the Courts Act. The Judicial Committee may also grant special leave to appeal from the decision of any court in any civil or criminal matter as per section 81(5) of the Constitution.<ref name=\"Constitution\">{{Cite web |url=http://mauritiusassembly.govmu.org/English/constitution/Pages/constitution2016.pdf |title=Constitution of Mauritius |date=2019-10-13 |publisher=[[National Assembly (Mauritius)]] |access-date=2019-10-13}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:Mauritius population pyramid 2011.svg|thumb|[[Population pyramid]] of Mauritius according to 2011 census]]\n{{main|Demographics of Mauritius|Religion in Mauritius}}\nThe estimated population of the Republic of Mauritius was at 1,265,985, of whom 626,341 were males and 639,644 females as at 1 July 2019.

Styles and forms introduced by Dutch, French, and British settlers from the seventeenth century onward, mixed with influences from India and East Africa, resulted in a unique hybrid architecture of international historic, social, and artistic significance. Mauritian structures present a variety of designs, materials, and decorative elements that are unique to the country and inform the historical context of the Indian Ocean and European colonialism.<ref name=\"wmf.org\">{{cite web|url=https://www.wmf.org/project/traditional-architecture-mauritius|title=Traditional Architecture of Mauritius|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nDecades of political, social, and economic change have resulted in the routine destruction of Mauritian architectural heritage. Between 1960 and 1980, the historic homes of the island's high grounds, known locally as campagnes, disappeared at alarming rates. More recent years have witnessed the demolition of plantations, residences, and civic buildings as they have been cleared or drastically renovated for new developments to serve an expanding tourism industry. The capital city of Port Louis remained relatively unchanged until the mid-1990s, yet now reflects the irreversible damage that has been inflicted on its built heritage. Rising land values are pitted against the cultural value of historic structures in Mauritius, while the prohibitive costs of maintenance and the steady decline in traditional building skills make it harder to invest in preservation.<ref name=\"wmf.org\"/>\n\nThe general populace historically lived in what are termed creole houses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vintagemauritius.org/vintage-houses/old-colonial-creole-style-houses-mauritius-part-1/|title=Old Colonial and Creole-Style Houses in Mauritius \u2013 Part 1 \u2013 Vintage Mauritius|date=6 June 2014|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Literature===\n{{Main|Mauritian literature}}\nProminent Mauritian writers include [[Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Humbert]], [[Malcolm de Chazal]], [[Ananda Devi]], [[Shenaz Patel]], [[Khal Torabully]], [[J.

Le Cl\u00e9zio, who won the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] in 2008, is of Mauritian heritage and holds dual French-Mauritian citizenship. The island plays host to the Le Prince Maurice Prize. In keeping with the island's literary culture the prize alternates on a yearly basis between English-speaking and French-speaking writers.\n\n===Music===\n{{main|Music of Mauritius|Sega (genre)}}\nThe major musical genres of Mauritius are [[Sega (genre)|Sega]] and its [[fusion genre]], [[Seggae]], [[Bhojpuri language|Bhojpuri]] [[Indian folk music|folk songs]], [[Filmi|Indian movie music]] especially [[Bollywood]], and [[Classical music]] mainly [[Western classical music]] and [[Indian classical music]].\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Further|Cuisine of Mauritius}}\nThe [[cuisine of Mauritius]] is a combination of Indian, Creole, French and Chinese, with many dishes unique to the island. Spices are also a big part of Mauritian cuisine.\n \nAlouda is a delicious cold beverage made with milk, basil seeds and agar-agar jelly which is especially refreshing on a hot summer day.\n\nRougaille or rougail is one of the classic Mauritian dishes that everyone on the island loves. It is essentially a tomato-based dish, with incredibly rich flavors thanks to the combination of spices used.\n\n===Holidays and festivals===\nThe public holidays of Mauritius involve the blending of several cultures from Mauritius's history.

Mah\u00e9 de La Bourdonnais established [[Port Louis]] as a naval base and a shipbuilding centre.<ref name=\"govt\"/>\n\nUnder his governorship, numerous buildings were erected, a number of which are still standing. These include part of Government House, the Ch\u00e2teau de Mon Plaisir, and the Line Barracks, the headquarters of the [[Mauritius Police Force|police force]]. The island was under the administration of the [[French East India Company]], which maintained its presence until 1767.<ref name=\"govt\"/>\n\nFrom 1767 to 1810, except for a brief period during the [[French Revolution]] when the inhabitants set up a government virtually independent of France, the island was controlled by officials appointed by the French government. [[Jacques-Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre]] lived on the island from 1768 to 1771, then went back to France, where he wrote ''[[Paul et Virginie]]'', a love story that made the Isle de France famous wherever the French language was spoken. Two famous French governors were the Vicomte de Souillac (who constructed the Chauss\u00e9e in Port Louis<ref name=\"Toussaint2\">Port Louis, A tropical City, Auguste Toussaint. {{ISBN|0 04 969001 9}}</ref> and encouraged farmers to settle in the district of Savanne) and [[Antoine Bruni d'Entrecasteaux]] (who saw to it that the French in the Indian Ocean should have their headquarters in Mauritius instead of [[Pondicherry]] in India).<ref name=\"Toussaint\">''A short History of Mauritius'', P.J. Barnwell & A. Toussaint</ref> [[Charles Mathieu Isidore Decaen]] was a successful general in the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and, in some ways, a rival of [[Napol\u00e9on I]]. He ruled as [[Governor of Isle de France (Mauritius)|Governor of Isle de France]] and R\u00e9union from 1803 to 1810. British naval [[cartographer]] and explorer [[Matthew Flinders]] was arrested and detained by General Decaen on the island, in contravention of an order from Napol\u00e9on. During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Mauritius became a base from which [[French corsairs]] organised successful raids on British commercial ships. The raids continued until 1810, when a [[Royal Navy]] expedition led by [[Commodore (Royal Navy)|Commodore]] [[Josias Rowley]], [[Royal Navy|R.N.]], an [[Anglo-Irish]] [[aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]], was sent to capture the island. Despite winning the [[Battle of Grand Port]], the only French naval victory over the British during these wars, the [[Invasion of \u00cele de France|French could not prevent the British from landing]] at [[Cap Malheureux]] three months later. They formally surrendered the island on the fifth day of the invasion, 3 December 1810,<ref name=\"Toussaint\"/> on terms allowing settlers to keep their land and property and to use the French language and law of France in criminal and civil matters.

However, it was tainted by the Ratsitatane episode. Ratsitatane, nephew of King Radama of Madagascar, was brought to Mauritius as a political prisoner. He managed to escape from prison and plotted a rebellion that would free the island's slaves. He was betrayed by an associate and was caught by the British forces, summarily judged, and condemned to death. He was beheaded at Plaine Verte on 15 April 1822, and his head was displayed as a deterrent against future uprisings among the slaves.<ref name=\"Selvon\">''A New Comprehensive History of Mauritius'', Sydney Selvon, 2012. {{ISBN|978-99949-34-91-1}}</ref>\n\nIn 1832, Adrien d'\u00c9pinay launched the first Mauritian newspaper (''Le Cern\u00e9en''), which was not controlled by the government. In the same year, there was a move by the procureur-general to abolish slavery without compensation to the slave owners. This gave rise to discontent, and, to check an eventual rebellion, the government ordered all the inhabitants to surrender their arms. Furthermore, a stone fortress, Fort Adelaide, was built on a hill (now known as the Citadel hill) in the centre of Port Louis to quell any uprising.<ref name=\"Toussaint2\"/>\n\n[[Slavery]] was abolished in 1835, and the planters ultimately received two million pounds sterling in compensation for the loss of their slaves, who had been imported from Africa and Madagascar during the French occupation. The [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolition of slavery]] had important impacts on Mauritius's society, economy and population. The planters brought a large number of [[Indentured servant|indentured labourers]] from India to work in the sugar cane fields. Between 1834 and 1921, around half a million indentured labourers were present on the island. They worked on sugar estates, factories, in transport and on construction sites. Additionally, the British brought 8,740 [[Indian people|Indian]] soldiers to the island.<ref name=\"govt\"/> [[Aapravasi Ghat]], in the bay at [[Port Louis]] and now a [[UNESCO]] site, was the first British [[colony]] to serve as a major reception centre for [[indentured servants]].\n\nAn important figure of the 19th century was R\u00e9my Ollier, a journalist of mixed origin. In 1828, the colour bar was officially abolished in Mauritius, but British governors gave little power to coloured persons, and appointed only whites as leading officials. R\u00e9my Ollier petitioned to [[Queen Victoria]] to allow coloureds in the council of government, and this became possible a few years later. He also made Port Louis become a municipality so that the citizens could administer the town through their own elected representatives. A street has been named after him in Port Louis, and his bust was erected in the Jardin de la Compagnie in 1906.<ref name=\"Toussaint\"/> In 1885 [[Constitution of Mauritius (1885)|a new constitution]] was introduced to Mauritius. It created elected positions on the governing council, but the franchise was restricted mainly to the French and Creole classes.\n\n[[File:Numa Desjardins Champ de Mars Port Louis 1880.jpg|thumb|left|[[Champ de Mars Racecourse]], Port Louis, 1880]]\n\nThe labourers brought from India were not always fairly treated, and a German, Adolph von Plevitz, made himself the unofficial protector of these immigrants. He mixed with many of the labourers, and in 1871 helped them to write a petition that was sent to [[Arthur Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Baron Stanmore|Governor Gordon]]. A commission was appointed to look into the complaints made by the Indian immigrants, and in 1872 two lawyers, appointed by the British Crown, were sent from England to make an inquiry. This Royal Commission recommended several measures that would affect the lives of Indian labourers during the next fifty years.<ref name=\"Toussaint\"/>\n\nIn November 1901, [[Mahatma Gandhi]] visited Mauritius, on his way from South Africa to India. He stayed on the island for two weeks, and urged the Indo-Mauritian community to take an interest in education and to play a more active role in politics. Back in India, he sent over a young lawyer, [[Manilal Doctor]], to improve the plight of the Indo-Mauritians. During the same year, faster links were established with the island of Rodrigues thanks to the wireless.<ref name=\"Dinan\">''Mauritius in the making across the censuses 1846\u20132000'', Monique Dinan. {{ISBN|99903-904-6-0}}</ref>\n\nIn 1903, motorcars were introduced in Mauritius, and in 1910 the first taxis, operated by Joseph Merven, came into service. The electrification of Port Louis took place in 1909, and in the same decade the Mauritius Hydro Electric Company (managed by the Atchia Brothers) was authorised to provide power to the towns of upper Plaines Wilhems.\n\n[[File:The web of empire - a diary of the imperial tour of their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York in 1901 (1902) (14763807672).jpg|thumb|Duke and Duchess of [[Duchy of Cornwall|Cornwall]] and [[Duke of York|York]] in Mauritius, 1901]]\nThe 1910s were a period of political agitation. The rising middle class (made up of doctors, lawyers, and teachers) began to challenge the political power of the sugar cane landowners. Dr. Eug\u00e8ne Laurent, mayor of Port Louis, was the leader of this new group; his party, Action Lib\u00e9rale, demanded that more people should be allowed to vote in the elections. Action Lib\u00e9rale was opposed by the Parti de l'Ordre, led by Henri Lecl\u00e9zio, the most influential of the sugar magnates.<ref name=\"Toussaint\"/> In 1911 there were riots in Port Louis due to a false rumour that Dr. Eug\u00e8ne Laurent had been murdered by the oligarchs in Curepipe. Shops and offices were damaged in the capital, and one person was killed. In the same year, 1911, the first public cinema shows took place in Curepipe, and, in the same town, a stone building was erected to house the Royal College.<ref name=\"Dinan\"/> In 1912, a wider telephone network came into service, used by the government, business firms, and a few private households.\n\n[[World War I]] broke out in August 1914. Many Mauritians volunteered to fight in Europe against the Germans and in [[Mesopotamia]] against the Turks. But the war affected Mauritius much less than the wars of the eighteenth century. In fact, the 1914\u20131918 war was a period of great prosperity due to a boom in sugar prices. In 1919 the Mauritius Sugar Syndicate came into being, which included 70% of all sugar producers.\n\nThe 1920s saw the rise of a \"retrocessionism\" movement, which favoured the retrocession of Mauritius to France. The movement rapidly collapsed because none of the candidates who wanted Mauritius to be given back to France were elected in the 1921 elections. In the post-war recession, there was a sharp drop in sugar prices. Many sugar estates closed down, marking the end of an era for the sugar magnates who had not only controlled the economy but also the political life of the country. Raoul Rivet, the editor of ''Le Mauricien'' newspaper, campaigned for a revision of the constitution that would give the emerging middle class a greater role in the running of the country. The principles of [[Arya Samaj]] began to infiltrate the Hindu community, who clamoured for more social justice.<ref name=\"Dinan\"/>\n\nThe 1930s saw the birth of the [[Labour Party (Mauritius)|Labour Party]], launched by Dr. Maurice Cur\u00e9. [[Emmanuel Anquetil]] rallied the urban workers while Pandit Sahadeo concentrated on the rural working class. The [[Uba riots of 1937]] resulted in reforms by the local British government that improved labour conditions and led to the un-banning of labour unions.<ref name=\"js\">{{Cite journal|title=Small-Scale Sugar Cane Farmers and Biotechnology in Mauritius: The \"Uba\" Riots of 1937 |journal = Agricultural History|volume = 69|issue = 2|last=Storey |first=William Kelleher |date=1995 |pages=163\u2013176 |jstor = 3744263}}</ref><ref name=\"rg\">{{Cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258935447 |title=Mauritius 1937: The Origins of a Milestone in Colonial Trade Union Legislation |journal=Labor History |volume=54 |issue=3 |last=Croucher |first=Richard |last2=Mcilroy |first2=John |date=2013-07-01 |pages=223\u2013239 |doi=10.1080/0023656X.2013.804268 |access-date=2018-08-18}}</ref> Labour Day was celebrated for the first time in 1938.

Some went to England to become pilots and ground staff in the [[Royal Air Force]]. Mauritius was never really threatened but several British ships were sunk outside Port Louis by German submarines in 1943.\n\nDuring World War II, conditions were hard in the country; the prices of commodities doubled but workers\u2019 salaries increased only by 10 to 20 percent. There was civil unrest, and the colonial government crushed all trade union activities. However, the labourers of Belle Vue Harel Sugar Estate went on strike on 27 September 1943. Police officers eventually fired on the crowd, and killed three labourers including a boy of ten and a pregnant woman, Anjaly Coopen.<ref>''Our Struggle, 20th Century Mauritius'', Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, Anand Mulloo</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lexpress.mu/node/203804/| title=The historical significance of Anjalay Coopen|website=[[L'Express (Mauritius)|L'Express]]|accessdate=22 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe first general elections were held on 9 August 1948 and were won by the Labour Party. This party, led by Guy Rozemont, bettered its position in 1953, and, on the strength of the election results, demanded [[universal suffrage]]. Constitutional conferences were held in London in 1955 and 1957, and the ministerial system was introduced. Voting took place for the first time on the basis of universal adult suffrage on 9 March 1959. The general election was again won by the Labour Party, led this time by [[Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam]].<ref name=ram>{{cite news|title=Histoire: Mauritius Independence 1961\u20131968|url=http://www.lemauricien.com/article/histoire-mauritius-independence-1961-1968|accessdate=9 September 2014|newspaper=Le Mauricien=9 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nA Constitutional Review Conference was held in London in 1961, and a programme of further constitutional advance was established. The 1963 election was won by the Labour Party and its allies. The [[Colonial Office]] noted that politics of a communal nature was gaining ground in Mauritius and that the choice of candidates (by parties) and the voting behaviour (of electors) were governed by ethnic and caste considerations.<ref name=ram/> Around that time, two eminent British academics, [[Richard Titmuss]] and [[James Meade]], published a report of the island's social problems caused by overpopulation and the monoculture of sugar cane. This led to an intense campaign to halt the population explosion, and the decade registered a sharp decline in population growth.\n\n===Independence (since 1968)===\n{{main|Mauritius (1968\u20131992)}}\nAt the Lancaster Conference of 1965, it became clear that Britain wanted to relieve itself of the colony of Mauritius. In 1959, [[Harold Macmillan]] had made his famous ''[[Wind of Change (speech)|Winds of Change Speech]]'' where he acknowledged that the best option for Britain was to give complete independence to its colonies.

However, article 36 of the International Court of Justice Statute provides that it is the option of the state whether it wishes to subject itself to the court's jurisdiction. Where the state chooses to be so bound, it may also restrict or limit the jurisdiction of the court in a number of ways. The UK's clause deposited at the court excluded, amongst other things, the jurisdiction of the court with regard \"to any disputes with the government of any country which is a member of the Commonwealth with regard to situations or facts existing before 1 January 1969\". The temporal limitation of 1 January 1969 was inserted to exclude all disputes arising during decolonisation. The effect of the British exclusionary clause would thus have prevented Mauritius from resorting to the court on the Chagos dispute because it is a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. When Mauritius threatened to leave the Commonwealth, the United Kingdom quickly amended its exclusion clause to exclude any disputes between itself, Commonwealth States and ''former Commonwealth States'', thereby quashing any Mauritian hopes to ever have recourse to the contentious jurisdiction of the court, even if it left.<ref name=\"commonwealth\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.mauritiustimes.com/mt/vimalen-reddi/ |title=The Chagos Dispute: Also Giving Law A Chance |last=Reddi |first=Vimalen |access-date=2019-02-26}}</ref>\n\n=====Advisory opinion=====\nOn 22 June 2017, by a margin of 94 to 15 countries, the [[UN General Assembly]] asked the [[International Court of Justice]] to give an advisory opinion on the separation of the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritius before the country's independence in the 1960s.

Before the Portuguese arrival in 1507, there were no terrestrial mammals on the island. This allowed the evolution of a number of flightless birds and large reptile species. The arrival of humans saw the introduction of invasive alien species, the rapid destruction of habitat and the loss of much of the endemic flora and fauna. Less than 2% of the [[Forest|native forest]] now remains, concentrated in the [[Black River Gorges National Park]] in the south-west, the Bambous Mountain Range in the south-east, and the Moka-Port Louis Ranges in the north-west. There are some isolated mountains, [[Corps de Garde]], [[Le Morne Brabant]], and several [[Islets of Mauritius|offshore islands]], with remnants of coastal and mainland diversity. Over 100 species of plants and animals have become extinct and many more are threatened. Conservation activities began in the 1980s with the implementation of programmes for the reproduction of threatened bird and plant species as well as habitat restoration in the national parks and nature reserves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://npcs.govmu.org/English//DOCUMENTS/CHAP1.PDF|title=Chapter 1.

Mauritius has a [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the Government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the Government and the [[National Assembly of Mauritius|National Assembly]].\n\nThe National Assembly is Mauritius's [[unicameral]] legislature, which was called the Legislative Assembly until 1992, when the country became a republic. It consists of 70 members, 62 elected for four-year terms in multi-member [[constituency|constituencies]] and eight additional members, known as \"best losers\", appointed by the Electoral Service Commission to ensure that ethnic and religious minorities are equitably represented. The UN Human Rights Committee (UNHRC), which monitors member states' compliance with the International Covenant on Political and Civil Rights (ICPCR), has criticised the country's Best Loser System following a complaint by a local youth and trade union movement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://country.eiu.com/article.aspx?articleid=59556590&Country=Mauritius&topic=Politics&subtopic=Forecast&subsubtopic=Election+watch&u=1&pid=1764509560&oid=1764509560&uid=1|title=UN Human Rights Committee criticises Best Loser System|publisher=Country.eiu.com|accessdate=6 September 2016}}</ref> The president is elected for a five-year term by the Parliament.\n\nThe island of Mauritius is divided into [[Constituencies of Mauritius|20 constituencies]] that return three members each, while Rodrigues is a single constituency that returns two members. After a general election, the Electoral Supervisory Commission may nominate up to eight additional members with a view to correct any imbalance in the representation of ethnic minorities in Parliament. This system of nominating members is commonly called the best loser system.\n\nThe political party or party alliance that wins the majority of seats in Parliament forms the government. Its leader becomes the Prime Minister, who selects the Cabinet from elected members of the Assembly, except for the Attorney General, who may not be an elected member of the Assembly. The political party or alliance which has the second largest majority forms the Official Opposition and its leader is normally nominated by the President of the Republic as the Leader of the Opposition. The Assembly elects a Speaker, a Deputy Speaker and a Deputy Chairman of Committees as some of its first tasks.\n\nMauritius is a democracy with a government elected every five years. The most recent National Assembly Election was held on 10 December 2014 in all the 20 mainland constituencies, and in the constituency covering the island of Rodrigues.

Considered part of Africa geographically, Mauritius has friendly relations with African states in the region, particularly South Africa, by far its largest continental trading partner. Mauritian investors are gradually entering African markets, notably Madagascar, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. The country's political heritage and dependence on Western markets have led to close ties with the [[European Union]] and its member states, particularly France. Relations with India is very strong for both historical and commercial reasons. Mauritius established diplomatic relations with China in April 1972 and was forced to defend this decision, along with naval contracts with the USSR in the same year.\n\nMauritius is a member of the [[World Trade Organization]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], [[La Francophonie]], the [[African Union]], the [[Southern Africa Development Community]] (SADC), the [[Indian Ocean Commission]], [[COMESA]], and formed the [[Indian Ocean Rim Association]].\n\n==Legal system==\nMauritius has an hybrid legal system derives from [[British common law]] and the [[French civil law]]. The [[Constitution of Mauritius]] established the [[separation of powers]] between the [[legislature]], the [[Executive (government)|executive]] and the [[judiciary]] and guaranteed the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual. Mauritius has a single-structured judicial system consisting of two tiers, the [[Supreme Court of Mauritius|Supreme Court]] and subordinate courts. The Supreme Court is composed of various divisions exercising jurisdiction such as the Master's Court, the Family Division, the Commercial Division (Bankruptcy), the Criminal Division, the Mediation Division, the Court of First Instance in civil and criminal proceedings, the Appellate jurisdiction: the Court of Civil Appeal and the Court of Criminal Appeal. Subordinate courts consist of the Intermediate Court, the Industrial Court, the District Courts, the Bail and Remand Court and the Court of Rodrigues. The [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] is the final court of appeal of Mauritius. After the independence of Mauritius in 1968, Mauritius maintained the Privy Council as its highest court of appeal. Appeals to the Judicial Committee from decisions of the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court may be as of right or with the leave of the Court, as set out in section 81 of the Constitution and section 70A of the Courts Act. The Judicial Committee may also grant special leave to appeal from the decision of any court in any civil or criminal matter as per section 81(5) of the Constitution.<ref name=\"Constitution\">{{Cite web |url=http://mauritiusassembly.govmu.org/English/constitution/Pages/constitution2016.pdf |title=Constitution of Mauritius |date=2019-10-13 |publisher=[[National Assembly (Mauritius)]] |access-date=2019-10-13}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:Mauritius population pyramid 2011.svg|thumb|[[Population pyramid]] of Mauritius according to 2011 census]]\n{{main|Demographics of Mauritius|Religion in Mauritius}}\nThe estimated population of the Republic of Mauritius was at 1,265,985, of whom 626,341 were males and 639,644 females as at 1 July 2019.

Other popular sports in Mauritius include cycling, table tennis, horse racing, badminton, volleyball, basketball, handball, boxing, judo, karate, taekwondo, weightlifting, bodybuilding and athletics. Water sports include swimming, sailing, scuba diving, windsurfing and [[kitesurfing]].\n\n[[Thoroughbred horse racing|Horseracing]], which dates from 1812 when the [[Champ de Mars Racecourse]] was inaugurated, remains popular. The country hosted the second (1985), fifth (2003) and tenth editions (2019) of the [[Indian Ocean Island Games]]. Mauritius won its first Olympic medal at the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in Beijing when boxer [[Bruno Julie]] won the bronze medal.\n\nIn golf, the former [[Mauritius Open]] and the current [[AfrAsia Bank Mauritius Open]] have been part of the [[European Tour]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Africa|Islands}}\n* [[Outline of Mauritius]]\n* [[Mauritian rupee]]\n* [[Index of Mauritius-related articles]]\n* [[List of Mauritius-related topics]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=Note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n* ''This article incorporates public domain text from the websites of the <span class=\"plainlinks\">[http://www.govmu.org/ Government Portal of Mauritius]</span>, the [[United States Department of State]], the U.S. [[Library of Congress]], and the [[The World Factbook|CIA World Factbook]].''\n* {{cite book|last=Macdonald|first=Fiona|title=Peoples of Africa|chapter=Mauritius|pages=340\u2013341|display-authors=etal}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|last=Bahadur|first=Gaiutra|year=2014|title=Coolie Woman: The Odyssey of Indenture|publisher=The University of Chicago|isbn=978-0-226-21138-1}}\n* {{cite book|last=Moree|first=Perry J.|title=A Concise History of Dutch Mauritius, 1598\u20131710: A Fruitful and Healthy Land|publisher=Routledge|year=1998}}\n* {{cite journal |last=Vink |first=Markus|title='The World's Oldest Trade': Dutch Slavery and Slave Trade in the Indian Ocean in the Seventeenth Century|journal=[[Journal of World History]]|volume=14|issue=2|year=2003|pages=131\u2013177|doi=10.1353/jwh.2003.0026}}\n\n==External links==\n{{cookbook}}\n{{Sister project links|Mauritius|voy=Mauritius}}\n\n<!-- please only list links of nation-wide relevance here.

language|multi-paradigm]] [[numerical analysis|numerical computing]] environment and [[proprietary programming language]] developed by [[MathWorks]]. MATLAB allows [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] manipulations, plotting of [[function (mathematics)|functions]] and data, implementation of [[algorithm]]s, creation of [[user interface]]s, and interfacing with programs written in other languages.\n\nAlthough MATLAB is intended primarily for numerical computing, an optional toolbox uses the [[MuPAD]] [[computer algebra system|symbolic engine]] allowing access to [[symbolic computing]] abilities. An additional package, [[Simulink]], adds graphical multi-domain simulation and [[model-based design]] for [[dynamical system|dynamic]] and [[embedded system]]s.\n\nAs of 2018, MATLAB has more than 3 million users worldwide.<ref name=\"mathworksCompanyOverview\">{{cite web |url=https://www.mathworks.com/content/dam/mathworks/tag-team/Objects/c/company-fact-sheet-8282v18.pdf |title=Company Overview |author = The MathWorks |date=April 2018}}</ref> MATLAB users come from various backgrounds of [[engineering]], [[science]], and [[economics]].\n\n== History ==\n[[Cleve Moler]], the chairman of the [[computer science]] department at the [[University of New Mexico]], started developing MATLAB in the late 1970s.<ref name=\"origins\">{{cite web | url = http://www.mathworks.com/company/newsletters/articles/the-origins-of-matlab.html | title = The Origins of MATLAB| author = Cleve Moler | accessdate = April 15, 2007 |date=December 2004 }}</ref> He designed it to give his students access to [[LINPACK]] and [[EISPACK]] without them having to learn [[Fortran]]. It soon spread to other universities and found a strong audience within the [[applied mathematics]] community. [[John N. Little|Jack Little]], an engineer, was exposed to it during a visit Moler made to [[Stanford University]] in 1983. Recognizing its commercial potential, he joined with Moler and Steve Bangert. They rewrote MATLAB in [[C (programming language)|C]] and founded [[MathWorks]] in 1984 to continue its development. These rewritten libraries were known as JACKPAC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altiusdirectory.com/Computers/matlab-programming-language.php|title=MATLAB Programming Language|publisher=Altius Directory|accessdate=December 17, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103203721/http://www.altiusdirectory.com/Computers/matlab-programming-language.php|archive-date=January 3, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2000, MATLAB was rewritten to use a newer set of libraries for matrix manipulation, [[LAPACK]].<ref>{{cite web|title=MATLAB Incorporates LAPACK|url=http://www.mathworks.com/company/newsletters/articles/matlab-incorporates-lapack.html|work=Cleve's Corner|publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=December 20, 2008|first=Cleve |last=Moler|date=January 2000}}</ref>\n\nMATLAB was first adopted by researchers and practitioners in [[control engineering]], Little's specialty, but quickly spread to many other domains. It is now also used in education, in particular the teaching of [[linear algebra]] and [[numerical analysis]], and is popular amongst scientists involved in [[image processing]].<ref name=\"origins\" />\n\n== Syntax ==\nThe MATLAB application is built around the MATLAB programming language. Common usage of the MATLAB application involves using the \"Command Window\" as an interactive mathematical [[command line interface|shell]] or executing text files containing MATLAB code.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/index.html|title=MATLAB Documentation |publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Variables ===\nVariables are defined using the assignment operator, <code>=</code>. MATLAB is a [[Strong and weak typing|weakly typed]] programming language because types are implicitly converted.<ref>{{cite web|title=Comparing MATLAB with Other OO Languages|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_oop/matlab-vs-other-oo-languages.html|work=MATLAB|publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}</ref>  It is an inferred typed language because variables can be assigned without declaring their type, except if they are to be treated as symbolic objects,<ref>{{cite web|title=Create Symbolic Variables and Expressions|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/creating-symbolic-variables-and-expressions.html|work=Symbolic Math Toolbox|publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}</ref> and that their type can change. Values can come from [[constant (computer science)|constant]]s, from computation involving values of other variables, or from the output of a function. For example:\n<source lang=\"matlabsession\">\n>> x = 17\nx =\n 17\n\n>> x = 'hat'\nx =\nhat\n\n>> x = [3*4, pi/2]\nx =\n   12.0000    1.5708\n\n>> y = 3*sin(x)\ny =\n   -1.6097    3.0000\n</source>\n\n=== Vectors and matrices ===\nA simple array is defined using the colon syntax: ''initial''<code>:</code>''increment''<code>:</code>''terminator''. For instance:\n<source lang=\"matlab\">\n>> array = 1:2:9\narray =\n 1 3 5 7 9\n</source>\ndefines a variable named <code>array</code> (or assigns a new value to an existing variable with the name <code>array</code>) which is an array consisting of the values 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. That is, the array starts at 1 (the ''initial'' value), increments with each step from the previous value by 2 (the ''increment'' value), and stops once it reaches (or to avoid exceeding) 9 (the ''terminator'' value).\n<source lang=\"matlab\">\n>> array = 1:3:9\narray =\n 1 4 7\n</source>\nthe ''increment'' value can actually be left out of this syntax (along with one of the colons), to use a default value of 1.\n<source lang=\"matlab\">\n>> ari = 1:5\nari =\n 1 2 3 4 5\n</source>\nassigns to the variable named <code>ari</code> an array with the values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, since the default value of 1 is used as the increment.\n\n[[One-based indexing|Indexing]] is one-based,<ref>{{cite web|title=Matrix Indexing|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/math/matrix-indexing.html|publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}</ref> which is the usual convention for [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] in mathematics, unlike zero-based indexing commonly used in other programming languages such as C, C++, and Java.\n\nMatrices can be defined by separating the elements of a row with blank space or comma and using a semicolon to terminate each row. The list of elements should be surrounded by square brackets <code>[]</code>. Parentheses <code>()</code> are used to access elements and subarrays (they are also used to denote a function argument list).\n\n<source lang=\"matlab\">\n>> A = [16 3 2 13; 5 10 11 8; 9 6 7 12; 4 15 14 1]\nA =\n 16  3  2 13\n  5 10 11  8\n  9  6  7 12\n  4 15 14  1\n\n>> A(2,3)\nans =\n 11\n</source>\n\nSets of indices can be specified by expressions such as <code>2:4</code>, which evaluates to <code>[2, 3, 4]</code>.  For example, a submatrix taken from rows 2 through 4 and columns 3 through 4 can be written as:\n<source lang=\"matlab\">\n>> A(2:4,3:4)\nans =\n 11 8\n 7 12\n 14 1\n</source>\nA square [[identity matrix]] of size ''n'' can be generated using the function <code>eye</code>, and matrices of any size with zeros or ones can be generated with the functions <code>zeros</code> and <code>ones</code>, respectively.\n<source lang=\"matlab\">\n>> eye(3,3)\nans =\n 1 0 0\n 0 1 0\n 0 0 1\n\n>> zeros(2,3)\nans =\n 0 0 0\n 0 0 0\n\n>> ones(2,3)\nans =\n 1 1 1\n 1 1 1\n</source>\n\n[[Transpose|Transposing]] a vector or a matrix is done either by the function <code>transpose</code> or by adding dot-prime after the matrix (without the dot, prime will perform [[conjugate transpose]] for complex arrays):\n<source lang=\"matlab\">\n>> A = [1 ; 2],  B = A.', C = transpose(A)\nA =\n     1\n     2\nB =\n     1     2\nC =\n     1     2\n\n>> D = [0 3 ; 1 5], D.'\nD =\n     0     3\n     1     5\nans =\n     0     1\n     3     5\n</source>\n\nMost functions accept arrays as input and operate element-wise on each element. For example, <code>mod(2*J,n)</code> will multiply every element in ''J'' by 2, and then reduce each element modulo ''n''. MATLAB does include standard <code>for</code> and <code>while</code> loops, but (as in other similar applications such as [[R (programming language)|R]]), using the [[Array programming|vectorized]] notation is encouraged and is often faster to execute. The following code, excerpted from the function ''magic.m'', creates a [[magic square]] ''M'' for odd values of ''n'' (MATLAB function <code>meshgrid</code> is used here to generate square matrices ''I'' and ''J'' containing ''1:n'').\n\n<source lang=\"matlab\">\n[J,I] = meshgrid(1:n);\nA = mod(I + J - (n + 3) / 2, n);\nB = mod(I + 2 * J - 2, n);\nM = n * A + B + 1;\n</source>\n\n=== Structures ===\nMATLAB supports structure data types.<ref>{{cite web|title=Structures|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/structures.html|publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}</ref> Since all variables in MATLAB are arrays, a more adequate name is \"structure array\", where each element of the array has the same field names. In addition, MATLAB supports dynamic field names<ref>{{cite web|title=Generate Field Names from Variables|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/generate-field-names-from-variables.html|publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}</ref> (field look-ups by name, field manipulations, etc.).\n\n=== Functions ===\nWhen creating a MATLAB function, the name of the file should match the name of the first function in the file. Valid function names begin with an alphabetic character, and can contain letters, numbers, or underscores.

MATLAB has value classes and reference classes, depending on whether the class has ''handle'' as a super-class (for reference classes) or not (for value classes).<ref>{{cite web|title=Comparing Handle and Value Classes|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_oop/comparing-handle-and-value-classes.html|publisher=MathWorks}}</ref>\n\nMethod call behavior is different between value and reference classes. For example, a call to a method\n<source lang=\"matlab\">\nobject.method();\n</source>\ncan alter any member of ''object'' only if ''object'' is an instance of a reference class, otherwise value class methods must return a new instance if it needs to modify the object.\n\nAn example of a simple class is provided below.\n\n<source lang=\"matlab\">\nclassdef Hello\n    methods\n        function greet(obj)\n            disp('Hello!')\n        end\n    end\nend\n</source>\n\nWhen put into a file named <tt>hello.m</tt>, this can be executed with the following commands:\n<source lang=\"matlabsession\">\n>> x = Hello();\n>> x.greet();\nHello!\n</source>\n\n== Graphics and graphical user interface programming ==\n\n* <graph>{\n\t\"version\": 2,\n\t\"width\": 400,\n\t\"height\": 200,\n\t\"data\": [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"name\": \"table\",\n\t\t\t\"values\": [\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"x\": 3,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"y\": 1\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"x\": 1,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"y\": 3\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"x\": 2,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"y\": 2\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"x\": 3,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"y\": 4\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t]\n\t\t}\n\t],\n\t\"scales\": [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"name\": \"x\",\n\t\t\t\"type\": \"ordinal\",\n\t\t\t\"range\": \"width\",\n\t\t\t\"zero\": false,\n\t\t\t\"domain\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"data\": \"table\",\n\t\t\t\t\"field\": \"x\"\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"name\": \"y\",\n\t\t\t\"type\": \"linear\",\n\t\t\t\"range\": \"height\",\n\t\t\t\"nice\": true,\n\t\t\t\"domain\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"data\": \"table\",\n\t\t\t\t\"field\": \"y\"\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t],\n\t\"axes\": [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"type\": \"x\",\n\t\t\t\"scale\": \"x\"\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"type\": \"y\",\n\t\t\t\"scale\": \"y\"\n\t\t}\n\t],\n\t\"marks\": [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"type\": \"rect\",\n\t\t\t\"from\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"data\": \"table\"\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\"properties\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"enter\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\"x\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"scale\": \"x\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"field\": \"x\"\n\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t\"y\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"scale\": \"y\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"field\": \"y\"\n\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t\"y2\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"scale\": \"y\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"value\": 0\n\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t\"fill\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"value\": \"steelblue\"\n\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t\"width\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"scale\": \"x\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"band\": \"true\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"offset\": -1\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t]\n}</graph>\n\nMATLAB has tightly integrated graph-plotting features. For example, the function ''plot'' can be used to produce a graph from two vectors ''x'' and ''y''.

language|multi-paradigm]] [[numerical analysis|numerical computing]] environment and [[proprietary programming language]] developed by [[MathWorks]]. MATLAB allows [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] manipulations, plotting of [[function (mathematics)|functions]] and data, implementation of [[algorithm]]s, creation of [[user interface]]s, and interfacing with programs written in other languages.\n\nAlthough MATLAB is intended primarily for numerical computing, an optional toolbox uses the [[MuPAD]] [[computer algebra system|symbolic engine]] allowing access to [[symbolic computing]] abilities. An additional package, [[Simulink]], adds graphical multi-domain simulation and [[model-based design]] for [[dynamical system|dynamic]] and [[embedded system]]s.\n\nAs of 2018, MATLAB has more than 3 million users worldwide.<ref name=\"mathworksCompanyOverview\">{{cite web |url=https://www.mathworks.com/content/dam/mathworks/tag-team/Objects/c/company-fact-sheet-8282v18.pdf |title=Company Overview |author = The MathWorks |date=April 2018}}</ref> MATLAB users come from various backgrounds of [[engineering]], [[science]], and [[economics]].\n\n== History ==\n[[Cleve Moler]], the chairman of the [[computer science]] department at the [[University of New Mexico]], started developing MATLAB in the late 1970s.<ref name=\"origins\">{{cite web | url = http://www.mathworks.com/company/newsletters/articles/the-origins-of-matlab.html | title = The Origins of MATLAB| author = Cleve Moler | accessdate = April 15, 2007 |date=December 2004 }}</ref> He designed it to give his students access to [[LINPACK]] and [[EISPACK]] without them having to learn [[Fortran]]. It soon spread to other universities and found a strong audience within the [[applied mathematics]] community. [[John N. Little|Jack Little]], an engineer, was exposed to it during a visit Moler made to [[Stanford University]] in 1983. Recognizing its commercial potential, he joined with Moler and Steve Bangert. They rewrote MATLAB in [[C (programming language)|C]] and founded [[MathWorks]] in 1984 to continue its development. These rewritten libraries were known as JACKPAC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altiusdirectory.com/Computers/matlab-programming-language.php|title=MATLAB Programming Language|publisher=Altius Directory|accessdate=December 17, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103203721/http://www.altiusdirectory.com/Computers/matlab-programming-language.php|archive-date=January 3, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2000, MATLAB was rewritten to use a newer set of libraries for matrix manipulation, [[LAPACK]].<ref>{{cite web|title=MATLAB Incorporates LAPACK|url=http://www.mathworks.com/company/newsletters/articles/matlab-incorporates-lapack.html|work=Cleve's Corner|publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=December 20, 2008|first=Cleve |last=Moler|date=January 2000}}</ref>\n\nMATLAB was first adopted by researchers and practitioners in [[control engineering]], Little's specialty, but quickly spread to many other domains. It is now also used in education, in particular the teaching of [[linear algebra]] and [[numerical analysis]], and is popular amongst scientists involved in [[image processing]].<ref name=\"origins\" />\n\n== Syntax ==\nThe MATLAB application is built around the MATLAB programming language. Common usage of the MATLAB application involves using the \"Command Window\" as an interactive mathematical [[command line interface|shell]] or executing text files containing MATLAB code.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/index.html|title=MATLAB Documentation |publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Variables ===\nVariables are defined using the assignment operator, <code>=</code>. MATLAB is a [[Strong and weak typing|weakly typed]] programming language because types are implicitly converted.<ref>{{cite web|title=Comparing MATLAB with Other OO Languages|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_oop/matlab-vs-other-oo-languages.html|work=MATLAB|publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}</ref>  It is an inferred typed language because variables can be assigned without declaring their type, except if they are to be treated as symbolic objects,<ref>{{cite web|title=Create Symbolic Variables and Expressions|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/creating-symbolic-variables-and-expressions.html|work=Symbolic Math Toolbox|publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}</ref> and that their type can change. Values can come from [[constant (computer science)|constant]]s, from computation involving values of other variables, or from the output of a function. For example:\n<source lang=\"matlabsession\">\n>> x = 17\nx =\n 17\n\n>> x = 'hat'\nx =\nhat\n\n>> x = [3*4, pi/2]\nx =\n   12.0000    1.5708\n\n>> y = 3*sin(x)\ny =\n   -1.6097    3.0000\n</source>\n\n=== Vectors and matrices ===\nA simple array is defined using the colon syntax: ''initial''<code>:</code>''increment''<code>:</code>''terminator''. For instance:\n<source lang=\"matlab\">\n>> array = 1:2:9\narray =\n 1 3 5 7 9\n</source>\ndefines a variable named <code>array</code> (or assigns a new value to an existing variable with the name <code>array</code>) which is an array consisting of the values 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. That is, the array starts at 1 (the ''initial'' value), increments with each step from the previous value by 2 (the ''increment'' value), and stops once it reaches (or to avoid exceeding) 9 (the ''terminator'' value).\n<source lang=\"matlab\">\n>> array = 1:3:9\narray =\n 1 4 7\n</source>\nthe ''increment'' value can actually be left out of this syntax (along with one of the colons), to use a default value of 1.\n<source lang=\"matlab\">\n>> ari = 1:5\nari =\n 1 2 3 4 5\n</source>\nassigns to the variable named <code>ari</code> an array with the values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, since the default value of 1 is used as the increment.\n\n[[One-based indexing|Indexing]] is one-based,<ref>{{cite web|title=Matrix Indexing|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/math/matrix-indexing.html|publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}</ref> which is the usual convention for [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] in mathematics, unlike zero-based indexing commonly used in other programming languages such as C, C++, and Java.\n\nMatrices can be defined by separating the elements of a row with blank space or comma and using a semicolon to terminate each row. The list of elements should be surrounded by square brackets <code>[]</code>. Parentheses <code>()</code> are used to access elements and subarrays (they are also used to denote a function argument list).\n\n<source lang=\"matlab\">\n>> A = [16 3 2 13; 5 10 11 8; 9 6 7 12; 4 15 14 1]\nA =\n 16  3  2 13\n  5 10 11  8\n  9  6  7 12\n  4 15 14  1\n\n>> A(2,3)\nans =\n 11\n</source>\n\nSets of indices can be specified by expressions such as <code>2:4</code>, which evaluates to <code>[2, 3, 4]</code>.  For example, a submatrix taken from rows 2 through 4 and columns 3 through 4 can be written as:\n<source lang=\"matlab\">\n>> A(2:4,3:4)\nans =\n 11 8\n 7 12\n 14 1\n</source>\nA square [[identity matrix]] of size ''n'' can be generated using the function <code>eye</code>, and matrices of any size with zeros or ones can be generated with the functions <code>zeros</code> and <code>ones</code>, respectively.\n<source lang=\"matlab\">\n>> eye(3,3)\nans =\n 1 0 0\n 0 1 0\n 0 0 1\n\n>> zeros(2,3)\nans =\n 0 0 0\n 0 0 0\n\n>> ones(2,3)\nans =\n 1 1 1\n 1 1 1\n</source>\n\n[[Transpose|Transposing]] a vector or a matrix is done either by the function <code>transpose</code> or by adding dot-prime after the matrix (without the dot, prime will perform [[conjugate transpose]] for complex arrays):\n<source lang=\"matlab\">\n>> A = [1 ; 2],  B = A.', C = transpose(A)\nA =\n     1\n     2\nB =\n     1     2\nC =\n     1     2\n\n>> D = [0 3 ; 1 5], D.'\nD =\n     0     3\n     1     5\nans =\n     0     1\n     3     5\n</source>\n\nMost functions accept arrays as input and operate element-wise on each element. For example, <code>mod(2*J,n)</code> will multiply every element in ''J'' by 2, and then reduce each element modulo ''n''. MATLAB does include standard <code>for</code> and <code>while</code> loops, but (as in other similar applications such as [[R (programming language)|R]]), using the [[Array programming|vectorized]] notation is encouraged and is often faster to execute. The following code, excerpted from the function ''magic.m'', creates a [[magic square]] ''M'' for odd values of ''n'' (MATLAB function <code>meshgrid</code> is used here to generate square matrices ''I'' and ''J'' containing ''1:n'').\n\n<source lang=\"matlab\">\n[J,I] = meshgrid(1:n);\nA = mod(I + J - (n + 3) / 2, n);\nB = mod(I + 2 * J - 2, n);\nM = n * A + B + 1;\n</source>\n\n=== Structures ===\nMATLAB supports structure data types.<ref>{{cite web|title=Structures|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/structures.html|publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}</ref> Since all variables in MATLAB are arrays, a more adequate name is \"structure array\", where each element of the array has the same field names. In addition, MATLAB supports dynamic field names<ref>{{cite web|title=Generate Field Names from Variables|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/generate-field-names-from-variables.html|publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}</ref> (field look-ups by name, field manipulations, etc.).\n\n=== Functions ===\nWhen creating a MATLAB function, the name of the file should match the name of the first function in the file. Valid function names begin with an alphabetic character, and can contain letters, numbers, or underscores.  Variables and functions are case sensitive.<ref>{{cite web|title=Case and Space Sensitivity|url=https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/case-and-space-sensitivity.html|publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=November 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Function handles ===\nMATLAB supports elements of [[lambda calculus]] by introducing function handles,<ref>{{cite web|title=Function Handles|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/function-handles.html|publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}</ref> or function references, which are implemented either in .m files or anonymous<ref>{{cite web|title=Anonymous Functions|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/anonymous-functions.html|publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}</ref>/nested functions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nested Functions|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/nested-functions.html|publisher=MathWorks.}}</ref>\n\n=== Classes and object-oriented programming ===\nMATLAB supports [[object-oriented programming]] including classes, inheritance, virtual dispatch, packages, pass-by-value semantics, and pass-by-reference semantics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/object-oriented-programming.html |title=Object-Oriented Programming|publisher=MathWorks|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}</ref> However, the syntax and calling conventions are significantly different from other languages. MATLAB has value classes and reference classes, depending on whether the class has ''handle'' as a super-class (for reference classes) or not (for value classes).<ref>{{cite web|title=Comparing Handle and Value Classes|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_oop/comparing-handle-and-value-classes.html|publisher=MathWorks}}</ref>\n\nMethod call behavior is different between value and reference classes. For example, a call to a method\n<source lang=\"matlab\">\nobject.method();\n</source>\ncan alter any member of ''object'' only if ''object'' is an instance of a reference class, otherwise value class methods must return a new instance if it needs to modify the object.\n\nAn example of a simple class is provided below.\n\n<source lang=\"matlab\">\nclassdef Hello\n    methods\n        function greet(obj)\n            disp('Hello!')\n        end\n    end\nend\n</source>\n\nWhen put into a file named <tt>hello.m</tt>, this can be executed with the following commands:\n<source lang=\"matlabsession\">\n>> x = Hello();\n>> x.greet();\nHello!\n</source>\n\n== Graphics and graphical user interface programming ==\n\n* <graph>{\n\t\"version\": 2,\n\t\"width\": 400,\n\t\"height\": 200,\n\t\"data\": [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"name\": \"table\",\n\t\t\t\"values\": [\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"x\": 3,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"y\": 1\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"x\": 1,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"y\": 3\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"x\": 2,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"y\": 2\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"x\": 3,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"y\": 4\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t]\n\t\t}\n\t],\n\t\"scales\": [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"name\": \"x\",\n\t\t\t\"type\": \"ordinal\",\n\t\t\t\"range\": \"width\",\n\t\t\t\"zero\": false,\n\t\t\t\"domain\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"data\": \"table\",\n\t\t\t\t\"field\": \"x\"\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"name\": \"y\",\n\t\t\t\"type\": \"linear\",\n\t\t\t\"range\": \"height\",\n\t\t\t\"nice\": true,\n\t\t\t\"domain\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"data\": \"table\",\n\t\t\t\t\"field\": \"y\"\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t],\n\t\"axes\": [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"type\": \"x\",\n\t\t\t\"scale\": \"x\"\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"type\": \"y\",\n\t\t\t\"scale\": \"y\"\n\t\t}\n\t],\n\t\"marks\": [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"type\": \"rect\",\n\t\t\t\"from\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"data\": \"table\"\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\"properties\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"enter\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\"x\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"scale\": \"x\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"field\": \"x\"\n\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t\"y\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"scale\": \"y\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"field\": \"y\"\n\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t\"y2\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"scale\": \"y\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"value\": 0\n\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t\"fill\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"value\": \"steelblue\"\n\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t\"width\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"scale\": \"x\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"band\": \"true\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"offset\": -1\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t]\n}</graph>\n\nMATLAB has tightly integrated graph-plotting features.
