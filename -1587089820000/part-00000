From his early days at school he participated and excelled in fields beyond athletics. At [[Fairlie]] School (1919\u201323) he was [[dux]] of the primary school, represented the school in rugby, competed in swimming and athletics, and was a [[prefect]]. At [[Timaru Boys' High School]], which he attended as a boarder from 1924, he set school athletics records but was also involved in nearly every area of school life. In 1928, his final year, Lovelock was school dux, head prefect, and won the school's boxing championship cup. The following year he went to [[University of Otago]] to study medicine. Lovelock showed a talent for sports while at the university, and competed for the university team in the New Zealand {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} championships. In 1931 he became a [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholar]] at [[Exeter College, Oxford|Exeter College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] from 1931 to 1934. He graduated with an [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|MB ChB]] degree as a medical practitioner.\n\n==Sports career==\n[[File:Jack Havelock breaking the finishing line at the Olympic Games 1936.jpg|thumb|left|Jack Havelock breaking the finishing line at the Summer Olympic Games 1936 in Berlin]]\nIn 1932\u2014by then holder of the British Empire record for the mile, at 4:12.0\u2014Lovelock competed in the [[1932 Summer Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], and placed 7th in the final of the [[Athletics at the 1932 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 1500 metres|1500 metres event]], won by [[Luigi Beccali]] of Italy.\n\nThe following year, he set a [[Mile run world record progression#IAAF era|world mile record]] of 4:07.6 when running at Princeton against its emerging champion [[Bill Bonthron]]. Later, in September, he represented New Zealand in the first [[World Student Games]] where he renewed his rivalry with Beccali, with Beccali winning.  In [[1934 British Empire Games|1934]] Lovelock won the gold medal in the mile (4:13.0) at the [[British Empire Games]]. He also lost some races, and believed that he could only make one supreme effort in a season.\n\nThe highlight of Lovelock's career came in 1936, when he won the gold medal in the 1500 m at the [[1936 Summer Olympics|Berlin Olympics]], setting a world record in the final (3:47.8). Lovelock had plotted ever since his defeat at Los Angeles and developed a revolutionary tactic. The race is regarded as one of the finest 1500 m Olympic finals and included one of the finest fields assembled. Hopefuls for the final included a culmination of contenders from the first great era of mile running from 1932\u201336 in which the world records for the 1500 m and mile had been broken several times. Apart from Lovelock, the potential rivals included the American mile world record holder [[Glenn Cunningham (athlete)|Glenn Cunningham]] who had broken Lovelock's world record in 1934, as well as Bonthron, Beccali, and the emerging English champion [[Sydney Wooderson]], all of whom hoped to line up to race in the Berlin Games. Bonthron, who held the world 1500m record, failed to make the US team, while Wooderson was found to have a fracture in his ankle and missed the final. The silver medalist in Los Angeles, [[John 'Jerry' Cornes]], also raced in Berlin along with the Swedish champion [[Erik Ny]], Canadian [[Phil Edwards (athlete)|Phil Edwards]], and American [[Gene Venzke]], who had been regarded as the favourite for the 1932 title until injury denied him a place in the US team. In the final, Lovelock beat Cunningham, who came in second, by making the unprecedented break from 300 m out. Lovelock had been regarded as a sprinter in the home straight but cleverly disguised his plan and caught his opponents napping with a brilliantly timed move. Cunningham, who also broke the world record in the race, was considered by many to be the greatest American miler of all time. Beccali was third.\n\nLovelock, who was the captain of the [[New Zealand Olympic team]], raced once more for the British Commonwealth after Berlin and his last race was back at Princeton en route to a Government-sponsored trip to New Zealand where he was beaten by another of the Olympic finalists, the American [[Archie San Romani]] (fourth in Berlin), with Cunningham third, rounding out the cast of a memorable period of middle distance running. Lovelock maintained his interest in athletics until at least the outbreak of the Second World War as a newspaper contributor.\n\n==Later life==\nLovelock was a [[major]] in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] during [[World War II]]. He married Cynthia James in 1945 and had two daughters. A year later, he began working at Manhattan Hospital in New York City. On 28 December 1949, he had telephoned his wife from work to inform her that he was coming home early because he was not feeling well.  He was waiting at the [[Church Avenue (IND Culver Line)|Church Avenue]] [[New York City Subway|subway]] station in [[Brooklyn]], New York, when he fell onto the tracks, probably as a result of one of the dizziness attacks to which he was subject after being thrown from a horse in 1940.  He was then killed by an oncoming train.<ref>*Megede, Ekkehard zur (1970) ''Die Geschichte der olympischen Leichtathletik - Band 1: 1896-1936'' Verlag Bartels & Wernitz KG</ref><ref>Matthews, Peter a.o.

Formerly known as '''Leavesden Film Studios''' and still colloquially known as '''Leavesden Studios''' or simply '''Leavesden''', it is a film and media complex owned by [[Warner Bros.]] The studios were all converted from an aircraft factory and airfield called '''Leavesden Aerodrome''', a centre of British aircraft production during [[World War II]]. It is situated in [[Abbots Langley]], near [[Watford]], in southwest [[Hertfordshire]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbsl.com/studios/find-us/|title=Find us {{!}} The Studios {{!}} Warner Bros Studios Leavesden|website=www.wbsl.com|access-date=2020-03-11}}</ref>\n\nWarner Bros. Studios, Leavesden is one of only a few places in the UK where large-scale film productions can be made. The studios contain approximately {{Convert|50000|m2|0|abbr=on}} of flexible space which includes stage space, one of the largest filtered and heated stage-based water tanks in Europe, production office space, workshops and support buildings, along with an extensive {{convert|32|ha|abbr=on}} [[backlot]] which offers a 180-degree uninterrupted horizon, favourable for exterior sets.

Since acquiring the site Warner Bros. has opened a public attraction called ''[[Warner Bros.

The de Havilland company, who were based in nearby [[Hatfield, Hertfordshire|Hatfield]], entered into a contract with the Air Ministry to produce what would become known as the [[De Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito]] fighter craft. Space for the large scale hangars needed to produce the huge number of aeroplanes required was not available at de Havilland's [[Hatfield Aerodrome]]. So the [[Ministry of Supply]] requisitioned this new site in Leavesden, which was an empty plot of land at the time from the Watford Corporation, and it was developed into the complex that it is today. The construction was enormously expensive so parts of the site were leased to the [[London Aircraft Production Group]] & The Second Aircraft Group. Under [[Handley Page]], another [[Hertfordshire]]-based aeroplane manufacturer contracted to the Air Ministry, these groups produced the [[Handley Page Halifax]] heavy bomber. As a result, by the end of the war Leavesden Airfield was, by volume, the largest factory in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.abct.org.uk/airfields/airfield-finder/leavesden/|title=Leavesden|author=Airfields of Britain Conservation Trust}}</ref>\n\nThe two planes were both critical successes for Britain during the conflict. Due to the high priority placed on aircraft production, large numbers of workers were drafted with little experience or training in aircraft production, with over half the workforce eventually being female. As part of constructing the aircraft factory an airstrip was created, first so the planes could be tested and later to deliver the craft to their final destinations. The runway and control tower still remain to this day, even after two major renovations, in an effort to preserve the site's history. The runway is now the main road through the complex and the tower is currently an observation lounge.\n\nAfter the war, the aerodrome was purchased outright by de Havilland, who themselves had a succession of owners in the following decades, including [[Hawker Siddeley]] from 1959, but ultimately they and the site were acquired by [[Rolls-Royce Holdings|Rolls-Royce]] who continued production and design of helicopter engines. Under Rolls-Royce ownership the RTM322 engine for the UK Apache, Merlin and NH90 helicopters was designed, developed and produced at Leavesden as a joint venture with Turbomeca of France. The airfield was also used by commercial small business aircraft as the field is close to both the [[M1 Motorway|M1]] & [[M25 motorway|M25]] motorways. However, by the early 1990s, Britain's manufacturing industry was in decline and Rolls-Royce had sold their interests in the site and transferred all work to their Bristol facility. Unable to find a new owner, by 1994 Leavesden Aerodrome was left disused and all but abandoned.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.allhs.org.uk/leavesdenaerodrome.htm|title=Leavesden Aerodrome \u2013 From Halifaxes to Hogwarts|website=www.allhs.org.uk|access-date=3 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Gringotts Wizarding Bank 2.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Gringotts Bank|Gringotts Wizarding Bank]], Diagon Alley film set]]\n{{CSS image crop\n|Image = Leavesden Studios - geograph.org.uk - 71811.jpg\n|bSize = 600\n|cWidth = 300\n|cHeight = 150\n|oTop = 100\n|oLeft = 300\n|Location = left\n|Description = The old \"Leavesden Studios\" sign in 2005\n}}\n\n===Leavesden Studios===\nIn 1994, [[Eon Productions]]' ''[[James Bond]]'' film ''[[GoldenEye]]'' was to be the next film in the series. [[Pinewood Studios]], their traditional home studio, was fully booked with other productions, not being prepared for the series' unexpected return. Facing little time to find a space in which they could build the number of large scale sets required, the production discovered the unoccupied Leavesden. The wide, tall and open aircraft hangars were uniquely well suited to conversion into film stages. Eon leased the site for the duration of their shoot and went about gutting the factories, turning them into stages, workshops and offices \u2013 in short a working [[film studio]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=H8DShVS-3cIC&pg=PA144 The film studio: film production in the global economy]</ref> This process is shown on the 2006 DVD's special features. Members of the production crew, impressed by the enormous size of the filmmaking complex they suddenly had to themselves, jokingly called Leavesden \"''Cubbywood''\" after Eon's long serving producer [[Albert R. Broccoli|Albert R. 'Cubby' Broccoli]].<ref name=\"secret\">{{cite video | people = Peter Aston, Pierce Brosnan, Martin Campbell | date = 26 December 1995| title = GoldenEye: The Secret Files | medium = TV Documentary | publisher = Carlton Television | accessdate =17 October 2007}}</ref>\n\n'''Leavesden Studios''', as the site was rebranded by its owners, quickly became popular after filming of ''GoldenEye'' was completed. A succession of major feature films made use of the site, in 1997, the first of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' prequels, ''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace|The Phantom Menace]]'' and later [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Sleepy Hollow (film)|Sleepy Hollow]]''.\n\n===''Harry Potter''===\nBy the year 2000, [[Heyday Films]] had acquired use of the site on behalf of [[Warner Bros.]] for what would be the first in a series of films, ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]''.<ref>[http://www.leavesden.info/films-made-at-leavesden/harry-potter/harry-potter-and-the-philosopher%E2%80%99s-stone/ Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone | Leavesden Studios]</ref> Every one of the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' films]] was based at Leavesden Studios over the following ten years.\n\nWhile other productions\u2014almost exclusively other Warner Bros. productions\u2014made partial use of the studios, the site was mostly occupied by ''Harry Potter''{{'}}s permanent standing sets. Indeed, some films, such as ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)|Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]]'' and ''[[Sherlock Holmes (2009 film)|Sherlock Holmes]]'' actually made use of some of the ''Harry Potter'' sets since they were sufficiently appropriate for their [[Victorian Era|Victorian]] setting and tone. During this time, however, it was noted that there were some ways in which the site's facilities might be improved. None of the stages were adequately soundproofed and the WW2 era ceilings had a tendency to leak during rainy weather.\n\n[[File:The Great Hall, Hogwarts.jpg|thumb|280px|left|Film set of the Great Hall, [[Hogwarts]] at ''Warner Bros.

It is situated in [[Abbots Langley]], near [[Watford]], in southwest [[Hertfordshire]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbsl.com/studios/find-us/|title=Find us {{!}} The Studios {{!}} Warner Bros Studios Leavesden|website=www.wbsl.com|access-date=2020-03-11}}</ref>\n\nWarner Bros. Studios, Leavesden is one of only a few places in the UK where large-scale film productions can be made. The studios contain approximately {{Convert|50000|m2|0|abbr=on}} of flexible space which includes stage space, one of the largest filtered and heated stage-based water tanks in Europe, production office space, workshops and support buildings, along with an extensive {{convert|32|ha|abbr=on}} [[backlot]] which offers a 180-degree uninterrupted horizon, favourable for exterior sets.

Since acquiring the site Warner Bros. has opened a public attraction called ''[[Warner Bros.

The de Havilland company, who were based in nearby [[Hatfield, Hertfordshire|Hatfield]], entered into a contract with the Air Ministry to produce what would become known as the [[De Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito]] fighter craft. Space for the large scale hangars needed to produce the huge number of aeroplanes required was not available at de Havilland's [[Hatfield Aerodrome]]. So the [[Ministry of Supply]] requisitioned this new site in Leavesden, which was an empty plot of land at the time from the Watford Corporation, and it was developed into the complex that it is today. The construction was enormously expensive so parts of the site were leased to the [[London Aircraft Production Group]] & The Second Aircraft Group. Under [[Handley Page]], another [[Hertfordshire]]-based aeroplane manufacturer contracted to the Air Ministry, these groups produced the [[Handley Page Halifax]] heavy bomber. As a result, by the end of the war Leavesden Airfield was, by volume, the largest factory in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.abct.org.uk/airfields/airfield-finder/leavesden/|title=Leavesden|author=Airfields of Britain Conservation Trust}}</ref>\n\nThe two planes were both critical successes for Britain during the conflict. Due to the high priority placed on aircraft production, large numbers of workers were drafted with little experience or training in aircraft production, with over half the workforce eventually being female. As part of constructing the aircraft factory an airstrip was created, first so the planes could be tested and later to deliver the craft to their final destinations. The runway and control tower still remain to this day, even after two major renovations, in an effort to preserve the site's history. The runway is now the main road through the complex and the tower is currently an observation lounge.\n\nAfter the war, the aerodrome was purchased outright by de Havilland, who themselves had a succession of owners in the following decades, including [[Hawker Siddeley]] from 1959, but ultimately they and the site were acquired by [[Rolls-Royce Holdings|Rolls-Royce]] who continued production and design of helicopter engines. Under Rolls-Royce ownership the RTM322 engine for the UK Apache, Merlin and NH90 helicopters was designed, developed and produced at Leavesden as a joint venture with Turbomeca of France. The airfield was also used by commercial small business aircraft as the field is close to both the [[M1 Motorway|M1]] & [[M25 motorway|M25]] motorways. However, by the early 1990s, Britain's manufacturing industry was in decline and Rolls-Royce had sold their interests in the site and transferred all work to their Bristol facility. Unable to find a new owner, by 1994 Leavesden Aerodrome was left disused and all but abandoned.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.allhs.org.uk/leavesdenaerodrome.htm|title=Leavesden Aerodrome \u2013 From Halifaxes to Hogwarts|website=www.allhs.org.uk|access-date=3 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Gringotts Wizarding Bank 2.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Gringotts Bank|Gringotts Wizarding Bank]], Diagon Alley film set]]\n{{CSS image crop\n|Image = Leavesden Studios - geograph.org.uk - 71811.jpg\n|bSize = 600\n|cWidth = 300\n|cHeight = 150\n|oTop = 100\n|oLeft = 300\n|Location = left\n|Description = The old \"Leavesden Studios\" sign in 2005\n}}\n\n===Leavesden Studios===\nIn 1994, [[Eon Productions]]' ''[[James Bond]]'' film ''[[GoldenEye]]'' was to be the next film in the series. [[Pinewood Studios]], their traditional home studio, was fully booked with other productions, not being prepared for the series' unexpected return. Facing little time to find a space in which they could build the number of large scale sets required, the production discovered the unoccupied Leavesden. The wide, tall and open aircraft hangars were uniquely well suited to conversion into film stages. Eon leased the site for the duration of their shoot and went about gutting the factories, turning them into stages, workshops and offices \u2013 in short a working [[film studio]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=H8DShVS-3cIC&pg=PA144 The film studio: film production in the global economy]</ref> This process is shown on the 2006 DVD's special features. Members of the production crew, impressed by the enormous size of the filmmaking complex they suddenly had to themselves, jokingly called Leavesden \"''Cubbywood''\" after Eon's long serving producer [[Albert R. Broccoli|Albert R. 'Cubby' Broccoli]].<ref name=\"secret\">{{cite video | people = Peter Aston, Pierce Brosnan, Martin Campbell | date = 26 December 1995| title = GoldenEye: The Secret Files | medium = TV Documentary | publisher = Carlton Television | accessdate =17 October 2007}}</ref>\n\n'''Leavesden Studios''', as the site was rebranded by its owners, quickly became popular after filming of ''GoldenEye'' was completed. A succession of major feature films made use of the site, in 1997, the first of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' prequels, ''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace|The Phantom Menace]]'' and later [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Sleepy Hollow (film)|Sleepy Hollow]]''.\n\n===''Harry Potter''===\nBy the year 2000, [[Heyday Films]] had acquired use of the site on behalf of [[Warner Bros.]] for what would be the first in a series of films, ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]''.<ref>[http://www.leavesden.info/films-made-at-leavesden/harry-potter/harry-potter-and-the-philosopher%E2%80%99s-stone/ Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone | Leavesden Studios]</ref> Every one of the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' films]] was based at Leavesden Studios over the following ten years.\n\nWhile other productions\u2014almost exclusively other Warner Bros. productions\u2014made partial use of the studios, the site was mostly occupied by ''Harry Potter''{{'}}s permanent standing sets. Indeed, some films, such as ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)|Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]]'' and ''[[Sherlock Holmes (2009 film)|Sherlock Holmes]]'' actually made use of some of the ''Harry Potter'' sets since they were sufficiently appropriate for their [[Victorian Era|Victorian]] setting and tone. During this time, however, it was noted that there were some ways in which the site's facilities might be improved.

Many of the myths of Dionysus are connected with his arrival in the form of a procession. The grandest such version was his triumphant return from \"[[India]]\", which influenced symbolic conceptions of the [[Roman triumph]] and was narrated in rapturous detail in [[Nonnus]]' ''[[Dionysiaca]]''. In this procession, Dionysus rides a [[chariot]], often drawn by [[big cat]]s such as tigers, leopards, or lions.\n\nThe ''thiasos'' of the sea god [[Poseidon]] is depicted as a triumphal wedding procession with [[Amphitrite]], attended by figures such as sea [[nymph]]s and [[hippocamp]]s.\n\nIn historical Greek society, ''thiasoi'' (plural) were [[Religion in ancient Greece|religious organizations]] whose existence was protected by law.<ref>For example the ''thiasos'' in Athens examined by Marcus N. Tod, \"A Statute of an Attic Thiasos\", ''The Annual of the British School at Athens'' '''13''' (1906/07):328-338).</ref>\n\n==Dionysian ''thiasos''==\n\nThe most significant members of the thiasus were the human female devotees, the [[maenads]], who gradually replaced immortal [[nymph]]s. In [[Pottery of ancient Greece|Greek vase-paintings]] or [[bas-relief]]s, lone female figures can be recognized as belonging to the thiasus by their brandishing the ''[[thyrsos]]'', the distinctive staff or rod of the devotee.\n\n[[File:Triumph of Bacchus - Sousse.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Triumph of Dionysus on a fragmentary Roman [[mosaic]] ''(3rd century, [[Sousse Archaeological Museum]])'']]\nOther regulars of the retinue were various nature spirits, including the [[Silenus|sileni]] (or human dancers costumed as such), [[phallus]]es much in evidence, [[satyr]]s, and [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]]. The [[ithyphallic]] sileni are often shown dancing on vase paintings.<ref>Karl Kerenyi (''Dionysos: Archetypal image of indestructible life'' 1976), selects as an example a 6th-century vase, figs 39/A and B.</ref> The tutor of Dionysus is represented by a single aged Silenus.

The grandest such version was his triumphant return from \"[[India]]\", which influenced symbolic conceptions of the [[Roman triumph]] and was narrated in rapturous detail in [[Nonnus]]' ''[[Dionysiaca]]''. In this procession, Dionysus rides a [[chariot]], often drawn by [[big cat]]s such as tigers, leopards, or lions.\n\nThe ''thiasos'' of the sea god [[Poseidon]] is depicted as a triumphal wedding procession with [[Amphitrite]], attended by figures such as sea [[nymph]]s and [[hippocamp]]s.\n\nIn historical Greek society, ''thiasoi'' (plural) were [[Religion in ancient Greece|religious organizations]] whose existence was protected by law.<ref>For example the ''thiasos'' in Athens examined by Marcus N.

{"title_page": "Anti-sweatshop movement", "text_new": "'''Anti-sweatshop movement''' refers to campaigns to improve the conditions of workers in [[sweatshop]]s, i.e. manufacturing places characterized by low wages, poor working conditions and often [[child labor]]. It started in the 19th century in industrialized countries such as the [[United States]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[United Kingdom]] to improve the conditions of workers in those countries.<ref name=Blackburn>Sheila Blackburn (1991) ''The Historical Journal'' '''34''' (1) 43-64 \"Ideology and Social Policy: The Origins of the Trade Boards Act\"</ref>\n\n== History ==\nSome of the earliest sweatshop critics were found in the 19th-century [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] movement that had originally coalesced in opposition to chattel [[slavery]], and many abolitionists saw similarities between slavery and sweatshop work. As slavery was successively outlawed in industrial countries between 1794 (in France) and 1865 (in the United States), some abolitionists sought to broaden the anti-slavery consensus to include other forms of harsh labor, including sweatshops. As it happened, the first significant law to address sweatshops (the [[Factory Act|Factory Act of 1833]]) was passed in the United Kingdom at the same time that the slave trade (1807) and ownership of slaves (1833) were made illegal.<ref name=\":4\">Miers, Suzanne (2003). ''Slavery in the Twentieth Century: The Evolution of a Global Problem''. Alta Mira Press, Walnut Creek, California.</ref>\n\nUltimately, the abolitionist movement split apart. Some advocates focused on working conditions and found common cause with trade unions and [[Marxists]] and socialist political groups, or [[progressive movement]] and the [[muckraker]]s. Others focused on the continued slave trade and [[involuntary servitude]] in the colonial world. For those groups that remained focused on slavery, sweatshops became one of the primary objects of controversy. Workplaces across multiple sectors of the economy were categorized as sweatshops. However, there were fundamental philosophical disagreements about what constituted slavery. Unable to agree on the status of sweatshops, the abolitionists working with the [[League of Nations]] and the United Nations ultimately backed away from efforts to define slavery, and focused instead on a common precursor of slavery \u2013 [[human trafficking]].<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThose focused on working conditions included [[Friedrich Engels]], whose book ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'' would inspire the Marxist movement named for his collaborator, [[Karl Marx]]. In the United Kingdom the Factory Act was revised six further times between 1844 and 1878 to help improve the condition of workers by limiting work hours and the use of child labor. The formation of the [[International Labour Organization]] in 1919 under the League of Nations and then the United Nations sought to address the plight of workers the world over. Concern over working conditions as described by muckraker journalists during the [[Progressive Era]] in the United States saw the passage of new workers rights laws and ultimately resulted in the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] of 1938, passed during the [[New Deal]].<ref>\"Fair Labor Standards Act - FLSA - 29 U.S. Code Chapter 8\". ''finduslaw.com''.</ref>\n\nIn the late 20th century, with the advent of [[globalization]], movements were formed to protest the [[exploitation of labour|exploitation of workers]] in poorer countries by companies based in wealthy countries. [[Noam Chomsky]] said in ''[[The Nation]]'' that the anti-sweatshop movement is in some ways, he said, \"like the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]], except that in this case it's striking at the core of the relations of exploitation. It's another example of how different constituencies are working together.\"<ref name=\"Chomsky\">[http://www.thenation.com/doc/20000424/chomsky/2 \"Talking 'Anarchy' With Chomsky\", ''The Nation'', April 5, 2000]</ref>  On February 4, 1997 Mayor Ed Boyle of North Olmsted, Ohio introduced the first piece of legislation actually prohibiting the government of purchasing, renting, or taking on consignment any and all goods made under sweatshop conditions and including in the definition those goods made by political prisoners. This legislation was copied by other American cities such as Detroit, New York, and San Francisco. Later Mayor Boyle introduced the legislation to the Mayors and Managers Association where it was immediately passed and he was invited by President Clinton to address a panel studying the subject in Washington, DC.\n\n=== Contemporary anti-sweatshop movement ===\nWith the rise of [[globalization]] and [[transnational corporations]] (TNCs) such as [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] or [[Gap Inc.|Gap]], many sweatshop laborers have lost autonomy and corporations have gained in their invincibility to anti-sweatshop laws within a particular country, as it is incredibly easy for them to simply move to another country if the laws become too restricting.<ref name=\":0\">Armbruster-Sandoval, Ralph. \"Workers of the world unite? The contemporary anti-sweatshop movement and the struggle for social justice in the Americas.\" ''Work and Occupations'' 32.4 (2005): 464-485.</ref>  As corporations globalize, many sweatshop movements have begun to see \"worker internationalization\" as one of the only viable solution; however, this requires strong labor movements, sufficient resources, and a commitment to mobilizing all workers, including women, which can be difficult to do at an international scale, as has been the case in the Americas.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Effectiveness of the movement ==\nA study published in 2011 found that while in most cases anti-sweatshop movements did not affect sales for companies using sweatshops, they did correspond with a decrease in the sales of well-known, more specialized brands and more intense movements caused more significant reduction in the sales.<ref name=\":3\">Bartley, Tim, and Curtis Child. \u201cMovements, Markets and Fields: The Effects of Anti-sweatshop Campaigns on U.S. Firms, 1993-2000\u201d. ''Social Forces'' 90.2 (2011): 425\u2013451. Web.</ref>  The same study also found that anti-sweatshop events also seemed to correspond with lower stock prices for the companies that were the target of these events, though some major anti-sweatshop events such the ''Kaksy'' lawsuit against Nike, did not result in any discernible change in stock price of the targeted company.  The study found that 64.1% of the companies targeted by anti-sweatshop movements saw drops in stock price in the five days following the anti-sweatshop event, and 56.4% saw drops in the two days following the event.  Though the study did find these slight negative economic effects, it did not find that, when taking into account companies of all reputations, anti-sweatshop movements or events damaged the reputation of the companies they targeted to a statistically significant degree; however, there does seem to be a slight undercutting of the reputations of companies with positive reputations when they are faced with anti-sweatshop campaigns, particularly intense ones.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Debate on the effects of sweatshops ==\n\n=== Criticism ===\nThe criticisms of sweatshops, and thus the reason for an anti-sweatshop movement, begins with the lack of safety regulations in sweatshops and their exploitative nature.<ref name=\":3\" /> Matt Zwolinski argues that though sweatshop laborers technically \"choose\" to work in sweatshops, this decision is not \"fully voluntary\" and that while sweatshops may provide opportunities that would not otherwise exist, when a worker \"consents\" to work in a sweatshop, they are also consenting to labor practices that cause more harm than good to the laborer overall.<ref name=\":3\" /> Another criticism includes the prevalence of child labor working heavy machinery for very low wages. This often requires children to be taken out of school, thus disrupting their education, and exposing them to very dangerous working conditions that may endanger their health.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Arguments in favor ===\n==== Provision of opportunities ====\nSome people, such as Pulitzer Prize winning journalist [[Nicholas Kristof]]f, argue that the anti-sweatshop movement \"risks harming the very people it is aiming to help.\"<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web\n| url = https://www.nytimes.com/library/magazine/home/20000924mag-sweatshops.html\n| title = Two Cheers for Sweatshops\n| website = www.nytimes.com\n| access-date = 2016-02-26\n}}</ref> This is because sweatshops signify the start of an industrial revolution in Asia and offer people a path towards making money and escaping poverty.<ref name=\":2\" />  The anti-sweatshop movement, in this view, can harm the impoverished workers by increasing labor costs for factories which, in turn, can incentivize turning to technology instead of people for labor and thus reduce the number of employees needed.  Additionally, if anti-sweatshop movements succeed and manage to get stricter guidelines passed, companies may move to countries with less strict laws governing sweatshops, thus removing a source of jobs and money for impoverished countries.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==== Effects on employment ====\nEven if a company does not move to another country with more relaxed labor laws, economic demand theory says that the more a good cost, the less the demand for it is. Economists argue that even though the labor is \"exploitative,\" it should be permitted, as trying to put regulations on sweatshop labor would only result in sweatshops needing fewer workers, thus reducing opportunities for individuals to make a living.<ref>Powell, Benjamin, and Matt Zwolinski. \"The ethical and economic case against sweatshop labor: A critical assessment.\" ''Journal of business ethics''107.4 (2012): 449-472.</ref>\n\n=== Views of economists ===\nMost economists say that sweatshops can be a benefit to Third World workers and the anti-sweatshop movement could reduce Third World employment and investment. The economic ways to think about this issue, employers and employees can both get benefits when they voluntarily sign the contract, no matter how low the wages are from the external\u2019s point of view. An economist pointed out \u201cas simple as this: \u2018Either you believe labor demand curves are downward sloping, or you don\u2019t,\u2019 as a neoclassical colleague said to me. Of course, not to believe that demand curves are negatively sloped would be tantamount to declaring yourself an economic illiterate.\u201d{{clarify}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=John|title=Why Economists Are Wrong About Sweatshops and the Antisweatshop Movement|date=2003|pages=93\u2013122}}</ref>\n\n== Related reality TV show ==\n''Sweatshop Deadly Fashion'' is a Norwegian reality TV show about three fashion bloggers investigating the sweatshop issue in the fashion industry. The three glamorous fashion bloggers, Frida, Ludvig and Anniken, gave up their glam-life in Norway and went to Phnom Penh, Cambodia for a month to see the reality of the conditions of people who make their clothes. The journey begins to question the poor standards of the working conditions that keep up with the massive manufacturing of clothing for people stay trendy. ''Sweatshop Deadly Fashion'' was released in ten minute episodes online on 19 January 2015.

This increasing awareness has pushed fashion companies to be more transparent about their manufacturing and supply chain process. As of June 2018, 172 brands across 68 countries have revealed more information about their supply chains than in previous years.

It started in the 19th century in industrialized countries such as the [[United States]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[United Kingdom]] to improve the conditions of workers in those countries.<ref name=Blackburn>Sheila Blackburn (1991) ''The Historical Journal'' '''34''' (1) 43-64 \"Ideology and Social Policy: The Origins of the Trade Boards Act\"</ref>\n\n== History ==\nSome of the earliest sweatshop critics were found in the 19th-century [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] movement that had originally coalesced in opposition to chattel [[slavery]], and many abolitionists saw similarities between slavery and sweatshop work. As slavery was successively outlawed in industrial countries between 1794 (in France) and 1865 (in the United States), some abolitionists sought to broaden the anti-slavery consensus to include other forms of harsh labor, including sweatshops. As it happened, the first significant law to address sweatshops (the [[Factory Act|Factory Act of 1833]]) was passed in the United Kingdom at the same time that the slave trade (1807) and ownership of slaves (1833) were made illegal.<ref name=\":4\">Miers, Suzanne (2003). ''Slavery in the Twentieth Century: The Evolution of a Global Problem''. Alta Mira Press, Walnut Creek, California.</ref>\n\nUltimately, the abolitionist movement split apart. Some advocates focused on working conditions and found common cause with trade unions and [[Marxists]] and socialist political groups, or [[progressive movement]] and the [[muckraker]]s. Others focused on the continued slave trade and [[involuntary servitude]] in the colonial world. For those groups that remained focused on slavery, sweatshops became one of the primary objects of controversy. Workplaces across multiple sectors of the economy were categorized as sweatshops. However, there were fundamental philosophical disagreements about what constituted slavery. Unable to agree on the status of sweatshops, the abolitionists working with the [[League of Nations]] and the United Nations ultimately backed away from efforts to define slavery, and focused instead on a common precursor of slavery \u2013 [[human trafficking]].<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThose focused on working conditions included [[Friedrich Engels]], whose book ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'' would inspire the Marxist movement named for his collaborator, [[Karl Marx]]. In the United Kingdom the Factory Act was revised six further times between 1844 and 1878 to help improve the condition of workers by limiting work hours and the use of child labor. The formation of the [[International Labour Organization]] in 1919 under the League of Nations and then the United Nations sought to address the plight of workers the world over. Concern over working conditions as described by muckraker journalists during the [[Progressive Era]] in the United States saw the passage of new workers rights laws and ultimately resulted in the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] of 1938, passed during the [[New Deal]].<ref>\"Fair Labor Standards Act - FLSA - 29 U.S. Code Chapter 8\". ''finduslaw.com''.</ref>\n\nIn the late 20th century, with the advent of [[globalization]], movements were formed to protest the [[exploitation of labour|exploitation of workers]] in poorer countries by companies based in wealthy countries. [[Noam Chomsky]] said in ''[[The Nation]]'' that the anti-sweatshop movement is in some ways, he said, \"like the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]], except that in this case it's striking at the core of the relations of exploitation. It's another example of how different constituencies are working together.\"<ref name=\"Chomsky\">[http://www.thenation.com/doc/20000424/chomsky/2 \"Talking 'Anarchy' With Chomsky\", ''The Nation'', April 5, 2000]</ref>  On February 4, 1997 Mayor Ed Boyle of North Olmsted, Ohio introduced the first piece of legislation actually prohibiting the government of purchasing, renting, or taking on consignment any and all goods made under sweatshop conditions and including in the definition those goods made by political prisoners. This legislation was copied by other American cities such as Detroit, New York, and San Francisco. Later Mayor Boyle introduced the legislation to the Mayors and Managers Association where it was immediately passed and he was invited by President Clinton to address a panel studying the subject in Washington, DC.\n\n=== Contemporary anti-sweatshop movement ===\nWith the rise of [[globalization]] and [[transnational corporations]] (TNCs) such as [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] or [[Gap Inc.|Gap]], many sweatshop laborers have lost autonomy and corporations have gained in their invincibility to anti-sweatshop laws within a particular country, as it is incredibly easy for them to simply move to another country if the laws become too restricting.<ref name=\":0\">Armbruster-Sandoval, Ralph. \"Workers of the world unite? The contemporary anti-sweatshop movement and the struggle for social justice in the Americas.\" ''Work and Occupations'' 32.4 (2005): 464-485.</ref>  As corporations globalize, many sweatshop movements have begun to see \"worker internationalization\" as one of the only viable solution; however, this requires strong labor movements, sufficient resources, and a commitment to mobilizing all workers, including women, which can be difficult to do at an international scale, as has been the case in the Americas.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Effects ==\nA study published in 2011 found that while in most cases anti-sweatshop movements did not affect sales for companies using sweatshops, they did correspond with a decrease in the sales of well-known, more specialized brands and more intense movements caused more significant reduction in the sales.<ref name=\":3\">Bartley, Tim, and Curtis Child. \u201cMovements, Markets and Fields: The Effects of Anti-sweatshop Campaigns on U.S. Firms, 1993-2000\u201d. ''Social Forces'' 90.2 (2011): 425\u2013451. Web.</ref>  The same study also found that anti-sweatshop events also seemed to correspond with lower stock prices for the companies that were the target of these events, though some major anti-sweatshop events such the ''Kaksy'' lawsuit against Nike, did not result in any discernible change in stock price of the targeted company.  The study found that 64.1% of the companies targeted by anti-sweatshop movements saw drops in stock price in the five days following the anti-sweatshop event, and 56.4% saw drops in the two days following the event.  Though the study did find these slight negative economic effects, it did not find that, when taking into account companies of all reputations, anti-sweatshop movements or events damaged the reputation of the companies they targeted to a statistically significant degree; however, there does seem to be a slight undercutting of the reputations of companies with positive reputations when they are faced with anti-sweatshop campaigns, particularly intense ones.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Debate on the effects of sweatshops ==\n\n=== Criticism ===\nThe criticisms of sweatshops, and thus the reason for an anti-sweatshop movement, begins with the lack of safety regulations in sweatshops and their exploitative nature.<ref name=\":3\" /> Matt Zwolinski argues that though sweatshop laborers technically \"choose\" to work in sweatshops, this decision is not \"fully voluntary\" and that while sweatshops may provide opportunities that would not otherwise exist, when a worker \"consents\" to work in a sweatshop, they are also consenting to labor practices that cause more harm than good to the laborer overall.<ref name=\":3\" /> Another criticism includes the prevalence of child labor working heavy machinery for very low wages. This often requires children to be taken out of school, thus disrupting their education, and exposing them to very dangerous working conditions that may endanger their health.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Arguments in favor ===\n==== Provision of opportunities ====\nSome people, such as Pulitzer Prize winning journalist [[Nicholas Kristof]]f, argue that the anti-sweatshop movement \"risks harming the very people it is aiming to help.\"<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web\n| url = https://www.nytimes.com/library/magazine/home/20000924mag-sweatshops.html\n| title = Two Cheers for Sweatshops\n| website = www.nytimes.com\n| access-date = 2016-02-26\n}}</ref> This is because sweatshops signify the start of an industrial revolution in Asia and offer people a path towards making money and escaping poverty.<ref name=\":2\" />  The anti-sweatshop movement, in this view, can harm the impoverished workers by increasing labor costs for factories which, in turn, can incentivize turning to technology instead of people for labor and thus reduce the number of employees needed.  Additionally, if anti-sweatshop movements succeed and manage to get stricter guidelines passed, companies may move to countries with less strict laws governing sweatshops, thus removing a source of jobs and money for impoverished countries.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==== Effects on employment ====\nEven if a company does not move to another country with more relaxed labor laws, economic demand theory says that the more a good cost, the less the demand for it is. Economists argue that even though the labor is \"exploitative,\" it should be permitted, as trying to put regulations on sweatshop labor would only result in sweatshops needing fewer workers, thus reducing opportunities for individuals to make a living.<ref>Powell, Benjamin, and Matt Zwolinski. \"The ethical and economic case against sweatshop labor: A critical assessment.\" ''Journal of business ethics''107.4 (2012): 449-472.</ref>\n\n=== Views of economists ===\nMost economists say that sweatshops can be a benefit to Third World workers and the anti-sweatshop movement could reduce Third World employment and investment. The economic ways to think about this issue, employers and employees can both get benefits when they voluntarily sign the contract, no matter how low the wages are from the external\u2019s point of view. An economist pointed out \u201cas simple as this: \u2018Either you believe labor demand curves are downward sloping, or you don\u2019t,\u2019 as a neoclassical colleague said to me. Of course, not to believe that demand curves are negatively sloped would be tantamount to declaring yourself an economic illiterate.\u201d{{clarify}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=John|title=Why Economists Are Wrong About Sweatshops and the Antisweatshop Movement|date=2003|pages=93\u2013122}}</ref>\n\n== Related reality TV show ==\n''Sweatshop Deadly Fashion'' is a Norwegian reality TV show about three fashion bloggers investigating the sweatshop issue in the fashion industry. The three glamorous fashion bloggers, Frida, Ludvig and Anniken, gave up their glam-life in Norway and went to Phnom Penh, Cambodia for a month to see the reality of the conditions of people who make their clothes. The journey begins to question the poor standards of the working conditions that keep up with the massive manufacturing of clothing for people stay trendy. ''Sweatshop Deadly Fashion'' was released in ten minute episodes online on 19 January 2015.

Despite a bump in the total fertility rates (TFR) of some European countries in the very late twentieth century (the 1980s and 1990s), especially France and [[Scandinavia]], they never returned to replacement level; the bump was largely due to older women realizing their dreams of motherhood. At first, falling fertility is due to [[urbanization]] and decreased [[infant mortality]] rates, which diminished the benefits and increased the costs of raising children. In other words, it became more economically sensible to invest more in fewer children, as economist [[Gary Becker]] argued. (This is the first demographic transition.) Falling fertility then came from attitudinal shifts. By the 1960s, people began moving from traditional and communal values towards more expressive and individualistic outlooks due to access to and aspiration of higher education, and to the spread of lifestyle values once practiced only by a tiny minority of cultural [[elite]]s. (This is the [[Demographic transition#Second demographic transition|second demographic transition]].) Although the momentous cultural changes of the 1960s leveled off by the 1990s, the social and cultural environment of the very late twentieth-century was quite different from that of the 1950s. Such changes in values have had a major effect on fertility. Member states of the [[European Economic Community]] saw a steady increase in not just divorce and out-of-wedlock births between 1960 and 1985 but also falling fertility rates. In 1981, a survey of countries across the [[Developed country|industrialized world]] found that while more than half of people aged 65 and over thought that women needed children to be fulfilled, only 35% of those between the ages of 15 to 24 (younger Baby Boomers and older Generation X) agreed.<ref name=\":23\">{{Cite book|title=Whither the Child?

This problem is especially acute in [[Eastern Europe]], whereas in Western Europe, it is alleviated by international immigration. In addition, an increasing number of children born in Europe has been born to non-European parents. Because children of immigrants in Europe tend to be about as religious as they are, this could slow the decline of religion (or the growth of [[secularism]]) in the continent as the twenty-first century progresses.<ref name=\":21\">{{Cite journal|last=Kaufmann|first=Eric|author-link=Eric Kaufmann|date=Winter 2010|title=Shall the Religious Inherit the Earth?|journal=Studies: An Irish Quarterly Review|volume=99|issue=396, the future of religion|pages=387\u201394|jstor=27896504}}</ref> In the United Kingdom, the number of foreign-born residents stood at 6% of the population in 1991. Immigration subsequently surged and has not fallen since (as of 2018). Researches by the demographers and political scientists [[Eric Kaufmann]], [[Roger Eatwell]], and [[Matthew Goodwin]] suggest that such a fast ethno-demographic change is one of the key reasons behind public backlash in the form of nationalist [[populism]] across the rich liberal democracies, an example of which is the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum]] (Brexit).<ref name=\":20\" />\n\nItaly is a country where the problem of an aging population is especially acute. The fertility rate dropped from about four in the 1960s down to 1.2 in the 2010s. This is not because young Italians do not want to procreate. Quite the contrary, having a lot of children is an Italian ideal. But its economy has been floundering since the [[Great Recession]] of 2007\u20138, with the [[youth unemployment]] rate at a staggering 35% in 2019. Many Italians have moved abroad \u2013 150,000 did in 2018 \u2013 and many are young people pursuing educational and economic opportunities. With the plunge in the number of births each year, the Italian population is expected to decline in the next five years. Moreover, the Baby Boomers are retiring in large numbers, and their numbers eclipse those of the young people taking care of them. Only Japan has an age structure more tilted towards the elderly.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/in-italy-rising-anxiety-over-falling-birth-rates|title=In Italy, rising anxiety over falling birth rates|last=Livesay|first=Christopher|date=November 25, 2019|work=PBS Newshour|access-date=December 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\nGreece also suffers from a serious demographic problem as many young people are leaving the country in search of better opportunities elsewhere in the wake of the Great Recession.

In the 2010s, among the residents of Australia, 5% were born in the United Kingdom, 2.5% from China, 2.2% from India, and 1.1% from the Philippines. 84% of new arrivals in the fiscal year of 2016 were below 40 years of age, compared to 54% of those already in the country. Like other immigrant-friendly countries, such as Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States, Australia's working-age population is expected to grow till about 2025.

They found that 20% of the establishments hailed from rural areas compared to 30% from urban areas. In addition, large innovative firms were more likely to be found in rural areas while small and medium firms tended to come from the metropolitan areas. This is because large patent-intensive manufacturing firms \u2013 such as those manufacturing chemicals, electronic components, automotive parts, or medical equipment \u2013 were generally based in rural areas while those that provide services tend to cluster in the cities. Nevertheless, rural creative centers tend to be relatively close to large urban centers.

However, Swedish students typically graduate with a lot of debt due to the high cost of living in their country, especially in the large cities such as Stockholm. The ratio of debt to expected income after graduation for Swedes was about 80% in 2013. In the U.S., despite incessant talk of student debt reaching epic proportions, that number stood at 60%. Moreover, about seven out of eight Swedes graduate with debt, compared to one half in the U.S. In the 2008\u20139 academic year, virtually all Swedish students take advantage of state-sponsored financial aid packages from a govern agency known as the [[National Board of Student Aid (Sweden)|Centrala Studiest\u00f6dsn\u00e4mnden]] (CSN), which include low-interest loans with long repayment schedules (25 years or until the student turns 60). In Sweden, student aid is based on their own earnings whereas in some other countries, such as Germany or the United States, such aid is premised on parental income as parents are expected to help foot the bill for their children's education. In the 2008\u20139 academic year, Australia, Austria, Japan, the Netherlands, and New Zealand saw an increase in both the average tuition fees of their public universities for full-time domestic students and the percentage of students taking advantage of state-sponsored student aid compared to 1995. In the United States, there was an increase in the former but not the latter.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/05/the-high-price-of-a-free-college-education-in-sweden/276428/|title=The High Price of a Free College Education in Sweden|last=Philips|first=Matt|date=May 31, 2013|work=The Atlantic|access-date=November 4, 2019|department=Global}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, judges in Karlsruhe, Germany, struck down a ban on university fees as unconstitutional on the grounds that it violated the constitutional right of German states to regulate their own higher education systems. This ban was introduced in order to ensure equality of access to higher education regardless of socioeconomic class. Bavarian Science Minister Thomas Goppel told the Associated Press, \"Fees will help to preserve the quality of universities.\" Supporters of fees argued that they would help ease the financial burden on universities and would incentivize students to study more efficiently, despite not covering the full cost of higher education, an average of \u20ac8,500 as of 2005.

A nominal tuition fee of \u00a31,000 was introduced in autumn 1998. Because not all parents would be able to pay all the fees in one go, monthly payment options, loans, and grants were made available. Some were concerned that making people pay for higher education may deter applicants. This turned out not to be the case.

Prime Minister Tony Blair introduced the goal of having half of young Britons having a university degree in 1999, though he missed the 2010 deadline. Demand for higher education in the United Kingdom remains strong, driven by the need for high-skilled workers from both the public and private sectors. There is, however, a widening gender gap.

The most expensive subjects were law, medicine, and dentistry, followed by the natural sciences, and then by the arts and social studies.

Data collected by the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], (UCLA) in 2011 showed that although these students typically came in with excellent high school GPAs and SAT scores, among science and engineering students, including pre-medical students, 60% changed their majors or failed to graduate, twice the attrition rate of all other majors combined. Despite their initial interest in secondary school, many university students find themselves overwhelmed by the reality of a rigorous STEM education. Some are mathematically unskilled, while others are simply lazy. The [[National Science Board]] raised the alarm all the way back in the mid-1980s that students often forget why they wanted to be scientists and engineers in the first place. Many bright students had an easy time in high school and failed to develop good study habits. In contrast, Chinese, Indian, and Singaporean students are exposed to mathematics and science at a high level from a young age. Moreover, given two students who are equally prepared, the one who goes to a more prestigious university is less likely to graduate with a STEM degree than the one who attends a less difficult school. Competition can defeat even the top students. Meanwhile, grade inflation is a real phenomenon in the humanities, giving students an attractive alternative if their STEM ambitions prove too difficult to achieve. Whereas STEM classes build on top of each other \u2013 one has to master the subject matter before moving to the next course \u2013 and have black and white answers, this is not the case in the humanities, where things are a lot less clear-cut.<ref name=\":56\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/education/edlife/why-science-majors-change-their-mind-its-just-so-darn-hard.html|title=Why Science Majors Change Their Minds (It's Just So Darn Hard)|last=Drew|first=Christopher|date=November 4, 2011|work=The New York Times|access-date=October 28, 2019|department=Education Life}}</ref>\n\n== Historical knowledge ==\nA February 2018 survey of 1,350 individuals found that 66% of the American millennials (and 41% of all U.S. adults) surveyed did not know what [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] was,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2018/04/12/two-thirds-of-millennials-dont-know-what-auschwitz-is-according-to-study-of-fading-holocaust-knowledge/?noredirect=on|title=Holocaust study: Two-thirds of millennials don't know what Auschwitz is|date=April 12, 2018|work=The Washington Post}}</ref> while 41% incorrectly claimed that 2&nbsp;million [[Jews]] or fewer were killed during [[the Holocaust]], and 22% said that they had never heard of the Holocaust.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/holocaust-study-millennials/|title=4 in 10 millennials don't know 6 million Jews were killed in Holocaust, study shows|date=12 April 2018|publisher=CBS News}}</ref> Over 95% of American millennials were unaware that a portion of the Holocaust occurred in the [[Baltic states]], which lost over 90% of their pre-war Jewish population, and 49% were not able to name a single [[List of Nazi concentration camps|Nazi concentration camp]] or ghetto in [[German-occupied Europe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.claimscon.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Holocaust-Knowledge-Awareness-Study_Executive-Summary-2018.pdf|title=Holocaust Knowledge and Awareness Study|website=www.claimscon.org|publisher=Schoen Consulting}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.claimscon.org/study|title=New Survey by Claims Conference Finds Significant Lack of Holocaust Knowledge in the United States|date=2018|archiveurl=https://archive.is/qrUxE|archivedate=12 April 2018|url-status=live|publisher=Claims Conference}}</ref> However, at least 93% surveyed believed that teaching about the Holocaust in school is important and 96% believed the Holocaust happened.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/12/us/holocaust-education.html|title=Holocaust Is Fading From Memory, Survey Finds|last1=Astor|first1=Maggie|date=12 April 2018|work=The New York Times|archiveurl=https://archive.is/uaSVa|archivedate=18 April 2018|url-status=live}}{{pb}}</ref>\n\nThe [[YouGov]] survey found that 42% of American millennials have never heard of [[Mao Zedong]], who ruled [[China]] from 1949 to 1976 and was responsible for the deaths of 20\u201345&nbsp;million people; another 40% are unfamiliar with [[Che Guevara]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/poll-millennials-desperately-need-to-bone-up-on-the-history-of-communism-2016-10-17|title=Poll: Millennials desperately need to bone up on the history of communism|date=21 October 2016|work=MarketWatch}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.voanews.com/a/young-americans-seen-less-opposed-to-socialist-ideas/3562681.html|title=Poll Finds Young Americans More Open to Socialist Ideas|date=23 October 2016|work=VOA News}}</ref>\n\n== Political views and participation ==\n\n=== Canadian millennials ===\nHistorically, political participation among young Canadian voters has been low, no higher than 40%.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/2a484194-edde-11e9-bfa4-b25f11f42901|title=Young Canadians fall out of love with Justin Trudeau|last=Kirby|first=Jason|date=October 14, 2019|work=The Financial Times|access-date=October 15, 2019}}</ref> However, the [[2015 Canadian federal election|2015 federal election]] was an exception, when 57% of the people aged 18 to 34 voted.

Political debates were mostly about economic questions, such as wealth redistribution, taxation, jobs, and the role of government. But as countries transitioned from having industrial economies to a post-industrial and globalized world, and as the twentieth century became the twenty-first, topics of political discourse changed to other questions and polarization due to competing values intensified. While this new period of political evolution was taking place, a new cohort of voters \u2013 Millennials \u2013 entered the scene and these people tend to think differently about the old issues than their elders. Moreover, they are less inclined than previous generations to identify (strongly) with a particular political party.<ref name=\":30\">{{Cite book|last=Eatwell|first=Roger|title=National Populism - The Revolt Against Liberal Democracy|last2=Goodwin|first2=Matthew|publisher=Pelican Book|year=2018|isbn=978-0-241-31200-1|location=|pages=|chapter=Chapter 6: De-alignment}}</ref>\n\nBut scholars such as [[Ronald Inglehart]] traced the roots of this new 'culture conflict' all the way back to the 1960s, which witnessed the emergence of the Baby Boomers, who were generally university-educated middle-class voters. Whereas their predecessors in the twentieth century \u2013 the Lost Generation, the Greatest Generation, and the Silent Generation \u2013 who had to endure severe poverty and world wars, focused on economic stability or simple survival, the Baby Boomers benefited from an economically secure, if not affluent, upbringing and as such tended to be drawn to 'post-materialist' values. Major topics for political discussion at that time were things like the sexual revolution, civil rights, nuclear weaponry, ethnocultural diversity, environmental protection, European integration, and the concept of 'global citizenship'. Some mainstream parties, especially the social democrats, moved to the left in order to accommodate these voters. In the twenty-first century, supporters of post-materialism lined up behind causes such as LGBT rights, climate change, multiculturalism, and various [[Media activism|political campaigns on social media]]. Inglehart called this the \"Silent Revolution.\" But not everyone approved, giving rise to what Piero Ignazi called the \"Silent Counter-Revolution.\"<ref name=\":30\" /> Education plays a role in this 'culture conflict' as national populism appeals most strongly to those who finished high school but did not graduate from university while the experience of higher education has been shown to be linked to having a socially liberal mindset. Degree holders tend to favor tolerance, individual rights and group identities whereas non-degree holders lean towards conformity, and maintaining order, customs, and traditions.<ref name=\":32\" />\n\nBy analyzing voter data, political scientists Roger Eatwell and Matthew Goodwin came to the conclusion that the popular narrative that the rise of national populist movements seen across much of the Western world is due largely to angry old white men who would soon be replaced by younger and more liberal voters is flawed. In many European democracies, national populist politicians and political parties tend to be the most popular among voters below the age of 40. In France, [[Marine Le Pen]] and her [[National Rally (France)|National Rally]] (formerly the National Front) won more votes from people between the ages of 18 and 35 during the first round of the 2017 Presidential election than any other candidates. In Italy, [[Matteo Salvini]] and his [[Lega Nord|League]] have a base of support with virtually no generational gap.

They favored individual liberty, small government, low taxes, limited welfare programs, and personal responsibility. While support for increased welfare programs for the poor at the cost of potentially higher taxes has declined steadily since the 1980s among all living demographic cohorts in the U.K., Generation Y disapproved of such spending schemes the most, according to data from Ipsos MORI and the [[British Social Attitudes Survey]]. On the other hand, they had a more relaxed attitude towards alcohol consumption, [[euthanasia]], [[same-sex marriage]] and the [[legalization of drugs]]. They disliked immigration, though less than their elders. They were more likely then their elders to support [[Fiscal conservatism|public debt reduction]]. They cared about the environment, but not at the expense of economic prosperity, and they supported privatizing utilities. In other words, they were [[Classical liberalism|classical liberals]] or libertarians.

But when various factors \u2013 including income, marital status, number of children, and geographical location \u2013 were taken into account, such a distinction ceased to be. In addition, once those factors are accounted for, millennials actually drive longer distances than the Baby Boomers. Economic forces, namely low gasoline prices, higher income, and suburban growth, result in millennials having an attitude towards cars that is no different from that of their predecessors. An analysis of the National Household Travel Survey by the State Smart Transportation Initiative revealed that higher-income millennials drive less than their peers probably because they are able to afford the higher costs of living in large cities, where they can take advantage of alternative modes of transportation, including public transit and ride-hailing services.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2019/03/millennial-car-ownership-driving-behavior-vehicle-data/585667/|title=Despite 'Car-Free' Hype, Millennials Drive a Lot|last=Bliss|first=Laura|date=March 27, 2019|work=CityLab|access-date=November 3, 2019|department=Transportation}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, young people are more likely to ride [[Public transportation in the United States|public transit]].

By the late 1960s or 1970s, the average woman had fewer than two children, and, although demographers at first expected a \"correction,\" such a rebound never came. Despite a bump in the total fertility rates (TFR) of some European countries in the very late twentieth century (the 1980s and 1990s), especially France and [[Scandinavia]], they never returned to replacement level; the bump was largely due to older women realizing their dreams of motherhood. At first, falling fertility is due to [[urbanization]] and decreased [[infant mortality]] rates, which diminished the benefits and increased the costs of raising children. In other words, it became more economically sensible to invest more in fewer children, as economist [[Gary Becker]] argued. (This is the first demographic transition.) Falling fertility then came from attitudinal shifts. By the 1960s, people began moving from traditional and communal values towards more expressive and individualistic outlooks due to access to and aspiration of higher education, and to the spread of lifestyle values once practiced only by a tiny minority of cultural [[elite]]s. (This is the [[Demographic transition#Second demographic transition|second demographic transition]].) Although the momentous cultural changes of the 1960s leveled off by the 1990s, the social and cultural environment of the very late twentieth-century was quite different from that of the 1950s. Such changes in values have had a major effect on fertility. Member states of the [[European Economic Community]] saw a steady increase in not just divorce and out-of-wedlock births between 1960 and 1985 but also falling fertility rates. In 1981, a survey of countries across the [[Developed country|industrialized world]] found that while more than half of people aged 65 and over thought that women needed children to be fulfilled, only 35% of those between the ages of 15 to 24 (younger Baby Boomers and older Generation X) agreed.<ref name=\":23\">{{Cite book|title=Whither the Child?

This problem is especially acute in [[Eastern Europe]], whereas in Western Europe, it is alleviated by international immigration. In addition, an increasing number of children born in Europe has been born to non-European parents.

Quite the contrary, having a lot of children is an Italian ideal. But its economy has been floundering since the [[Great Recession]] of 2007\u20138, with the [[youth unemployment]] rate at a staggering 35% in 2019. Many Italians have moved abroad \u2013 150,000 did in 2018 \u2013 and many are young people pursuing educational and economic opportunities. With the plunge in the number of births each year, the Italian population is expected to decline in the next five years. Moreover, the Baby Boomers are retiring in large numbers, and their numbers eclipse those of the young people taking care of them.

Ireland, Luxembourg, Hungary, and the United Kingdom need more financial experts. All member states except Finland need more ICT specialists, and all but Belgium, Greece, Spain, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Portugal and the United Kingdom need more teachers. The supply of STEM graduates has been insufficient because the [[Dropping out|dropout rate]] is high and because of an ongoing brain drain from some countries. Some countries need more teachers because many are retiring and need to be replaced. At the same time, Europe's aging population necessitates the expansion of the healthcare sector.

However, Swedish students typically graduate with a lot of debt due to the high cost of living in their country, especially in the large cities such as Stockholm. The ratio of debt to expected income after graduation for Swedes was about 80% in 2013. In the U.S., despite incessant talk of student debt reaching epic proportions, that number stood at 60%. Moreover, about seven out of eight Swedes graduate with debt, compared to one half in the U.S. In the 2008\u20139 academic year, virtually all Swedish students take advantage of state-sponsored financial aid packages from a govern agency known as the [[National Board of Student Aid (Sweden)|Centrala Studiest\u00f6dsn\u00e4mnden]] (CSN), which include low-interest loans with long repayment schedules (25 years or until the student turns 60). In Sweden, student aid is based on their own earnings whereas in some other countries, such as Germany or the United States, such aid is premised on parental income as parents are expected to help foot the bill for their children's education. In the 2008\u20139 academic year, Australia, Austria, Japan, the Netherlands, and New Zealand saw an increase in both the average tuition fees of their public universities for full-time domestic students and the percentage of students taking advantage of state-sponsored student aid compared to 1995.

Because not all parents would be able to pay all the fees in one go, monthly payment options, loans, and grants were made available.

Data collected by the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], (UCLA) in 2011 showed that although these students typically came in with excellent high school GPAs and SAT scores, among science and engineering students, including pre-medical students, 60% changed their majors or failed to graduate, twice the attrition rate of all other majors combined. Despite their initial interest in secondary school, many university students find themselves overwhelmed by the reality of a rigorous STEM education. Some are mathematically unskilled, while others are simply lazy. The [[National Science Board]] raised the alarm all the way back in the mid-1980s that students often forget why they wanted to be scientists and engineers in the first place. Many bright students had an easy time in high school and failed to develop good study habits. In contrast, Chinese, Indian, and Singaporean students are exposed to mathematics and science at a high level from a young age. Moreover, given two students who are equally prepared, the one who goes to a more prestigious university is less likely to graduate with a STEM degree than the one who attends a less difficult school. Competition can defeat even the top students. Meanwhile, grade inflation is a real phenomenon in the humanities, giving students an attractive alternative if their STEM ambitions prove too difficult to achieve. Whereas STEM classes build on top of each other \u2013 one has to master the subject matter before moving to the next course \u2013 and have black and white answers, this is not the case in the humanities, where things are a lot less clear-cut.<ref name=\":56\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/education/edlife/why-science-majors-change-their-mind-its-just-so-darn-hard.html|title=Why Science Majors Change Their Minds (It's Just So Darn Hard)|last=Drew|first=Christopher|date=November 4, 2011|work=The New York Times|access-date=October 28, 2019|department=Education Life}}</ref>\n\n== Historical knowledge ==\nA February 2018 survey of 1,350 individuals found that 66% of the American millennials (and 41% of all U.S. adults) surveyed did not know what [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] was,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2018/04/12/two-thirds-of-millennials-dont-know-what-auschwitz-is-according-to-study-of-fading-holocaust-knowledge/?noredirect=on|title=Holocaust study: Two-thirds of millennials don't know what Auschwitz is|date=April 12, 2018|work=The Washington Post}}</ref> while 41% incorrectly claimed that 2&nbsp;million [[Jews]] or fewer were killed during [[the Holocaust]], and 22% said that they had never heard of the Holocaust.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/holocaust-study-millennials/|title=4 in 10 millennials don't know 6 million Jews were killed in Holocaust, study shows|date=12 April 2018|publisher=CBS News}}</ref> Over 95% of American millennials were unaware that a portion of the Holocaust occurred in the [[Baltic states]], which lost over 90% of their pre-war Jewish population, and 49% were not able to name a single [[List of Nazi concentration camps|Nazi concentration camp]] or ghetto in [[German-occupied Europe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.claimscon.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Holocaust-Knowledge-Awareness-Study_Executive-Summary-2018.pdf|title=Holocaust Knowledge and Awareness Study|website=www.claimscon.org|publisher=Schoen Consulting}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.claimscon.org/study|title=New Survey by Claims Conference Finds Significant Lack of Holocaust Knowledge in the United States|date=2018|archiveurl=https://archive.is/qrUxE|archivedate=12 April 2018|url-status=live|publisher=Claims Conference}}</ref> However, at least 93% surveyed believed that teaching about the Holocaust in school is important and 96% believed the Holocaust happened.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/12/us/holocaust-education.html|title=Holocaust Is Fading From Memory, Survey Finds|last1=Astor|first1=Maggie|date=12 April 2018|work=The New York Times|archiveurl=https://archive.is/uaSVa|archivedate=18 April 2018|url-status=live}}{{pb}}</ref>\n\nThe [[YouGov]] survey found that 42% of American millennials have never heard of [[Mao Zedong]], who ruled [[China]] from 1949 to 1976 and was responsible for the deaths of 20\u201345&nbsp;million people; another 40% are unfamiliar with [[Che Guevara]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/poll-millennials-desperately-need-to-bone-up-on-the-history-of-communism-2016-10-17|title=Poll: Millennials desperately need to bone up on the history of communism|date=21 October 2016|work=MarketWatch}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.voanews.com/a/young-americans-seen-less-opposed-to-socialist-ideas/3562681.html|title=Poll Finds Young Americans More Open to Socialist Ideas|date=23 October 2016|work=VOA News}}</ref>\n\n== Political views and participation ==\n\n=== Canadian millennials ===\nHistorically, political participation among young Canadian voters has been low, no higher than 40%.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/2a484194-edde-11e9-bfa4-b25f11f42901|title=Young Canadians fall out of love with Justin Trudeau|last=Kirby|first=Jason|date=October 14, 2019|work=The Financial Times|access-date=October 15, 2019}}</ref> However, the [[2015 Canadian federal election|2015 federal election]] was an exception, when 57% of the people aged 18 to 34 voted.

Political debates were mostly about economic questions, such as wealth redistribution, taxation, jobs, and the role of government. But as countries transitioned from having industrial economies to a post-industrial and globalized world, and as the twentieth century became the twenty-first, topics of political discourse changed to other questions and polarization due to competing values intensified. While this new period of political evolution was taking place, a new cohort of voters \u2013 Millennials \u2013 entered the scene and these people tend to think differently about the old issues than their elders. Moreover, they are less inclined than previous generations to identify (strongly) with a particular political party.<ref name=\":30\">{{Cite book|last=Eatwell|first=Roger|title=National Populism - The Revolt Against Liberal Democracy|last2=Goodwin|first2=Matthew|publisher=Pelican Book|year=2018|isbn=978-0-241-31200-1|location=|pages=|chapter=Chapter 6: De-alignment}}</ref>\n\nBut scholars such as [[Ronald Inglehart]] traced the roots of this new 'culture conflict' all the way back to the 1960s, which witnessed the emergence of the Baby Boomers, who were generally university-educated middle-class voters. Whereas their predecessors in the twentieth century \u2013 the Lost Generation, the Greatest Generation, and the Silent Generation \u2013 who had to endure severe poverty and world wars, focused on economic stability or simple survival, the Baby Boomers benefited from an economically secure, if not affluent, upbringing and as such tended to be drawn to 'post-materialist' values. Major topics for political discussion at that time were things like the sexual revolution, civil rights, nuclear weaponry, ethnocultural diversity, environmental protection, European integration, and the concept of 'global citizenship'. Some mainstream parties, especially the social democrats, moved to the left in order to accommodate these voters. In the twenty-first century, supporters of post-materialism lined up behind causes such as LGBT rights, climate change, multiculturalism, and various [[Media activism|political campaigns on social media]]. Inglehart called this the \"Silent Revolution.\" But not everyone approved, giving rise to what Piero Ignazi called the \"Silent Counter-Revolution.\"<ref name=\":30\" /> Education plays a role in this 'culture conflict' as national populism appeals most strongly to those who finished high school but did not graduate from university while the experience of higher education has been shown to be linked to having a socially liberal mindset. Degree holders tend to favor tolerance, individual rights and group identities whereas non-degree holders lean towards conformity, and maintaining order, customs, and traditions.<ref name=\":32\" />\n\nBy analyzing voter data, political scientists Roger Eatwell and Matthew Goodwin came to the conclusion that the popular narrative that the rise of national populist movements seen across much of the Western world is due largely to angry old white men who would soon be replaced by younger and more liberal voters is flawed. In many European democracies, national populist politicians and political parties tend to be the most popular among voters below the age of 40. In France, [[Marine Le Pen]] and her [[National Rally (France)|National Rally]] (formerly the National Front) won more votes from people between the ages of 18 and 35 during the first round of the 2017 Presidential election than any other candidates. In Italy, [[Matteo Salvini]] and his [[Lega Nord|League]] have a base of support with virtually no generational gap. In Austria, more than one in two men between the ages of 18 and 29 voted for the [[Freedom Party of Austria|Freedom Party]] in 2016. The [[Alternative for Germany]]'s strongest support came not from senior citizens but voters between 25 and 50 years of age.

While support for increased welfare programs for the poor at the cost of potentially higher taxes has declined steadily since the 1980s among all living demographic cohorts in the U.K., Generation Y disapproved of such spending schemes the most, according to data from Ipsos MORI and the [[British Social Attitudes Survey]]. On the other hand, they had a more relaxed attitude towards alcohol consumption, [[euthanasia]], [[same-sex marriage]] and the [[legalization of drugs]].

They found that overall, younger adults tended to lean liberal while older adults tilted conservative. More specifically, groups with strong conservative leanings included the elderly, residents of the Midwest and the South, and people with some or no college education. Groups with strong liberal leanings were adults with advanced degrees, whereas those with moderate liberal leanings included younger adults (18 to 29 and 30 to 49), women, and residents of the East. Gallup found little variations by income groups compared to the national average.

Among adults aged 30 to 49 \u2013 older Millennials and younger Generation X \u2013 they found that 30% considered themselves liberals, 37% moderates, and 29% conservatives.(See above.) Between 1992 and 2018, the number of people identifying as liberals steadily increased, 17% to 26%, mainly at the expense of the group identifying as moderates. Meanwhile, the proportion of conservatives remained largely unchanged, albeit with fluctuations. Between 1994 and 2018, the number of members of the Democratic Party identifying as liberal rose from 25% to 51%, as the number of both moderates and conservatives gradually fell. Liberals became a majority in this political party for the first time in 2018. During the same period, in the Republican Party, the proportion of people calling themselves conservatives climbed from 58% to 73% while the numbers of moderates and liberals both dropped. In other words, this political party saw its conservative majority expanding.

But when various factors \u2013 including income, marital status, number of children, and geographical location \u2013 were taken into account, such a distinction ceased to be. In addition, once those factors are accounted for, millennials actually drive longer distances than the Baby Boomers. Economic forces, namely low gasoline prices, higher income, and suburban growth, result in millennials having an attitude towards cars that is no different from that of their predecessors. An analysis of the National Household Travel Survey by the State Smart Transportation Initiative revealed that higher-income millennials drive less than their peers probably because they are able to afford the higher costs of living in large cities, where they can take advantage of alternative modes of transportation, including public transit and ride-hailing services.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2019/03/millennial-car-ownership-driving-behavior-vehicle-data/585667/|title=Despite 'Car-Free' Hype, Millennials Drive a Lot|last=Bliss|first=Laura|date=March 27, 2019|work=CityLab|access-date=November 3, 2019|department=Transportation}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, young people are more likely to ride [[Public transportation in the United States|public transit]].

They found that the largest clusters of metropolitan areas in which it was feasible to not own a car were the [[Northeast Corridor]] (Boston to Washington, D.C.) and the [[Pacific Northwest Corridor]] (Seattle to Portland, Oregon). Outside of these, there were [[Chicago metropolitan area|Chicagoland]] and Los Angeles County. All of these places were densely populated with high costs of living.

Immigration from the Middle East and Africa is an engine of religious growth in Europe.

The ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]]'' define \"asana\" as \"[a position that] is steady and comfortable\".<ref name=\"yogasutras\"/> Patanjali mentions the ability to sit for extended periods as one of the [[Ashtanga (eight limbs of yoga)|eight limbs of his system]].<ref name=\"yogasutras\">[[Patanjali]] ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Yoga sutras]]'', Book II:29, 46</ref> Asanas are called '''yoga poses''' or '''yoga postures''' in English. \n\nThe 10th or 11th century ''[[Goraksha Samhita|Goraksha Sataka]]'' and the 15th century ''[[Hatha Yoga Pradipika]]'' identify 84 asanas; the 17th century ''Hatha Ratnavali'' provides a different list of 84 asanas, describing some of them. In the 20th century, [[Indian nationalism]] favoured [[physical culture]] in response to [[colonialism]]. In that environment, pioneers such as [[Yogendra]], [[Kuvalayananda]], and [[Krishnamacharya]] taught a new system of asanas (incorporating systems of exercise as well as traditional hatha yoga). Among Krishnamacharya's pupils were influential Indian yoga teachers including [[Pattabhi Jois]], founder of [[Ashtanga vinyasa yoga]], and [[B.K.S. Iyengar]], founder of [[Iyengar yoga]]. Together they described hundreds more asanas, revived the popularity of yoga, and brought it to the Western world. Many more asanas have been devised since Iyengar's 1966 ''[[Light on Yoga]]'' which described some 200 asanas. Hundreds more were illustrated by [[Dharma Mittra]].\n\nAsanas were claimed to provide both spiritual and physical benefits in medieval hatha yoga texts. More recently, studies have provided evidence that they improve flexibility, strength, and balance; to reduce stress and conditions related to it; and specifically to alleviate some diseases such as asthma<ref name=ross /><ref name=hayes /> and diabetes.<ref name=alexander />\n\nAsanas have appeared in culture for many centuries. Religious [[Indian art]] depicts figures of [[Buddha]], [[Shiva]], and [[Jain]] [[tirthankara]]s in [[lotus position]] and other meditation seats, and in the \"royal ease\" position, [[lalitasana]]. With the popularity of yoga as exercise, asanas feature commonly in [[novels]] and [[films]], and sometimes also in [[advertising]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Ancient times ===\n[[File:Yogi.

Hatha Yoga added the ability to cure diseases to this list.{{sfn|Mallinson|Singleton|2017|pp=92\u201395}} Not all Hindu scriptures agreed that asanas were beneficial. The 10th century ''[[Garuda Purana]]'' stated that \"the techniques of posture do not promote yoga.

The ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]]'' define \"asana\" as \"[a position that] is steady and comfortable\".<ref name=\"yogasutras\"/> Patanjali mentions the ability to sit for extended periods as one of the [[Ashtanga (eight limbs of yoga)|eight limbs of his system]].<ref name=\"yogasutras\">[[Patanjali]] ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Yoga sutras]]'', Book II:29, 46</ref> Asanas are called '''yoga poses''' or '''yoga postures''' in English. \n\nThe 10th or 11th century ''[[Goraksha Samhita|Goraksha Sataka]]'' and the 15th century ''[[Hatha Yoga Pradipika]]'' identify 84 asanas; the 17th century ''Hatha Ratnavali'' provides a different list of 84 asanas, describing some of them. In the 20th century, [[Indian nationalism]] favoured [[physical culture]] in response to [[colonialism]]. In that environment, pioneers such as [[Yogendra]], [[Kuvalayananda]], and [[Krishnamacharya]] taught a new system of asanas (incorporating systems of exercise as well as traditional hatha yoga). Among Krishnamacharya's pupils were influential Indian yoga teachers including [[Pattabhi Jois]], founder of [[Ashtanga vinyasa yoga]], and [[B.K.S. Iyengar]], founder of [[Iyengar yoga]]. Together they described hundreds more asanas, revived the popularity of yoga, and brought it to the Western world. Many more asanas have been devised since Iyengar's 1966 ''[[Light on Yoga]]'' which described some 200 asanas. Hundreds more were illustrated by [[Dharma Mittra]].\n\nAsanas were claimed to provide both spiritual and physical benefits in medieval hatha yoga texts. More recently, studies have provided evidence that they improve flexibility, strength, and balance; to reduce stress and conditions related to it; and specifically to alleviate some diseases such as asthma<ref name=ross /><ref name=hayes /> and diabetes.<ref name=alexander />\n\nAsanas have appeared in culture for many centuries. Religious [[Indian art]] depicts figures of [[Buddha]], [[Shiva]], and [[Jain]] [[tirthankara]]s in [[lotus position]] and other meditation seats, and in the \"royal ease\" position, [[lalitasana]]. With the popularity of yoga as exercise, asanas feature commonly in [[novels]] and [[films]], and sometimes also in [[advertising]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Ancient times ===\n[[File:Yogi.

The inscription mentions the Raja of Chamba facing an attack by Kiras aided by the Lord of Durgara (''durg\u0101re\u015bwara''). In medieval times the term ''Durgar'' is believed to have turned into ''Dugar'', eventually transforming to \"Dogra\". Kalhana's ''[[Rajatarangini]]'' makes no mention of a kingdom by any of these names, but the kingdoms could have been referred to by their capital cities (such as ''Vallapura'', modern [[Billawar]], or ''Babbapura'', modern Babor). In modern times, the term Dogra turned into an ethnic identity, claimed by all those people that speak the [[Dogri language]], irrespective of their religion.{{sfn|Handa, Textiles, Costumes, and Ornaments of the Western Himalaya|1998|pp=178\u2013179}}\n\n==History==\nScholar Omachanda Handa believes that the Durgara people were originally migrants from Rajasthan to the [[Terai]] belt, similar to the [[Gurjaras]] (or \"Gujjars\"). The allusion to ''durg'' (fort) in their name indicates that they may have remained a warrior people, eventually founding powerful kingdoms between [[Chenab River|Chenab]] and [[Ravi River|Ravi]], and possibly dominating up to the [[Sutlej River|Sutluj]] river.{{sfn|Handa, Textiles, Costumes, and Ornaments of the Western Himalaya|1998|pp=178\u2013180}}\n\nAccording to [[M. A. Stein]], there were some eleven Dogra states in the region, all of which were eventually absorbed into the [[Jammu]] state, which emerged as the most powerful among them.{{sfn|Stein, Kalhana's Rajatarangini|1900|p=432}} Prior to the rise of Jammu, Babbapura (Babor) is expected to have been the chief state of Dogras. Lying 45 km east of Jammu, Babor contains the ruins of six magnificent temples representing a \"thriving artistic activity\".<ref name=\"Saraf1987\">{{citation |last=Saraf |first=D.

The lower Himalayan ranges begin behind the town of Jammu, which rests on a slope over {{convert|1300|ft}} above sea level, overlooking and commanding the plain watered by the [[Chenab]], [[Ravi River|Ravi]], [[Tawi River|Tawi]] and [[Ujh River|Ujh]] rivers. The Jammu region consists of ten districts: [[Jammu]], [[Kathua]], [[Udhampur]], [[Doda district|Doda]], [[Poonch (town)|Poonch]], [[Kishtwar]], [[Reasi]], [[Samba, Jammu|Samba]], [[Ramban district|Ramban]] and [[Rajouri]]. The city of Jammu is the winter capital of the state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]].\n\nThe Jammu Dogras traditionally inhabited the area between the slopes of the [[Sivalik Hills|Shivalik range]] of mountains, the sacred lakes of Saroien sar and Mannsar but later spread over whole of Jammu region. They generally speak Dogri and other dialects similar to Dogri. The majority of the Dogra are followers of [[Hindu]]ism, but a large number in Jammu and Kashmir believe in other religions. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, some Dogras embraced [[Islam]]. These factors, together with the effects of immigration into the region, have resulted in the Dogra population of Jammu and Kashmir including members of all three religions. \n\nThe [[Dogra dynasty|Dogra Raj]] emerged as a regional power, particularly after Maharaja [[Gulab Singh]] emerged as a warrior and his subjects received special martial recognition from the [[British Raj]]. The rule of Gulab Singh's Raj extended over the whole of the Jammu Region, a large part of the Ladakh region as early as March 1846, and a large part of the Indian Punjab (now [[Himachal Pradesh]]). The [[Kashmir Valley]] was handed over to Gulab Singh by the British government, as part of the territories ceded to the British government by Lahore State according to the provisions of Article IV of the [[Treaty of Lahore]] dated 9{{nbsp}}March 1846. Under the [[Treaty of Amritsar, 1846|Treaty of Amritsar]] in the same year, the Dogra king of Jammu and the state was thereafter known as the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir State (Raj), also thereafter referred as Kashmir State. The term Dogra hence is more akin to the subjects of Himachal Pradesh, some areas of Punjab and the whole region of Jammu that was ruled by Raja Gulab Singh as part of the Dogra Raj irrespective of the religion of the inhabitants.\n\n===Cultural profile===\n* ''Kud'', a ritual dance performed in honour of Lok Devatas. This dance style is performed mostly at night. It is spontaneous and people of all ages and sexes participate. Instruments used during the Kud are Narshingha, chhaina, flute, drumsm etc. The rhythm of music controls the movement of participants. This dance continues for the whole night. The number of participants ranges from 20 to 30 members.\n* ''Heren'', a traditional theatre form performed during the Lohri festival by 10\u201315 people. It is mostly performed in hilly regions of Jammu, Udhampur and ramnagar.\n* ''Fumenie'' and ''Jagarana'', a dance style performed by women on the eve of groom's departure to in-laws house. Both the songs are sung by a group consisting of 15\u201320 members. This traditional dance form depicts the feelings and emotions of women.\n* ''Bakh/Gwatri/Kark/Masade'', a chorus narrative sung by a group of 10 singers without any musical instruments.\n* ''Gwatri'', a singing\u2013dance combined tradition in which the singers narrate some text which is acted by the Gwatari dancers.\n* ''Karak'', a narrative ballet sung by a community called 'Jogies'. They narrate a popular folk tale in their dance style, performed by three members with accompaniment of a typical folk instrument called 'Rabab'.\n* ''Benthe'', the chorus singing tradition performed specific community of tribal called Gujjar and Bakerwal. The dance is performed by 5\u20137 members.<ref>Govt of J&K Website</ref>\n\n==The Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir (Dogra dynasty)==\n{{main|The Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir}}\nThe [[Dogra dynasty]] was a dynasty of [[Hindu]] [[Rajputs]] who ruled [[Jammu & Kashmir]] from 1846 to 1947. They traced their ancestry to the [[Ikshvaku dynasty|Ikshvaku]] (Solar) Dynasty of [[Northern India]] (the same clan in which [[Lord Rama]] was born; he, therefore, is the 'kuldevta' (family deity) of the Dogras). \n[[File:Gulabsingh1840.jpg|thumb|[[Gulab Singh]], the first Maharaja of [[Dogra dynasty|Dogra Rajput dynasty]] which ruled [[Jammu & Kashmir]].]]\n[[File:Sir Hari Singh Bahadur, Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir, 1944.jpg|thumb|[[Maharaja Hari Singh]], the last monarch of [[Dogra dynasty|Dogra Rajput dynasty]] which ruled [[Jammu & Kashmir]].]]\n\nAmong the enlightened rulers of Jammu was Raja Ranjit Dev (1728\u20131780) who introduced certain social reforms such as a ban on '[[Sati (practice)|Sati]]' (immolation of the wife on the funeral pyre of the husband) and female infanticide. Later, under [[Ranjit Singh|Maharaja Ranjit Singh]], the state became part of the [[Sikh Empire]] of the [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] after it was captured from its Afghan rulers. Ranjit Singh rendered this state to his general, [[Maharaja Gulab Singh Jamwal]], who belonged to the Jamwal Rajput clan that ruled Jammu. He extended the boundaries of Jammu to western Tibet with the help of General Zorawar Singh. \n\nThe Sikh Empire rule extended beyond the Jammu Region and the [[Kashmir Valley]] to the Tibetan Buddhist Kingdom of [[Ladakh]] and the Emirates of [[State of Hunza|Hunza]], [[Gilgit Agency|Gilgit]] and [[State of Nagar|Nagar]]. After the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]] in 1846, the British gave Kashmir and the title of 'Maharaja' to [[Gulab Singh]] \u2014 the chief minister \u2014  as a reward for aligning with them against the [[Sikhs]].<ref>Nalwa, V., 2009. Hari Singh Nalwa-Champion of the Khalsaji. New Delhi: Manohar, p. 220, {{ISBN|81-7304-785-5}}.</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Dogra cuisine===\n\n[[Wheat]], [[maize]] and [[Pearl millet|bajra]] are staple food besides rice, cereals and a tangier preparation made out of mango or tamarind popularly known as ''maani''. The whole dish is called ''dal puth maani'' and is savoured as a combination. ''Mitha madra'' is a favourite and is cooked from milk, dry fruits, and semolina. Preparations of ''rajmash'' (a special variety of red kidney beans); ''auria'' a dish of curd fermented by rye; ''ambal'' made from pumpkin, jaggery and tamarind are favourites, especially during ceremonial cooking. The expert cooks are called ''Siyans'', usually [[Brahmins]]. ''Kalari'' is a milk preserved by cogulation of proteins and then fried in a pan to make it delicious.\n\nNon-vegetarian food was limited to Rajputs and Vaish (Mahajans). 'Khatta meat' is mutton cooked with sour pomegranate seeds (Anardana) or lime juice and flavoured with fumes of a burning charcoal soaked in mustard oil. Keur is one of the well known foods of Dogras. It is prepared by flour and butter and served with sugar and curd. Mostly, it is served to bridegroom at the time of marriage by the in-laws. Kalaari is a favourite food of Dogras in the rainy season. It is prepared by flour mix, cottage cheese and milk cream (malai) with water with help of a small cup shaped pot. Kalari is served with milk. [[Kalari cheese]] is popular in the Jammu region and in Jammu and Kashmir state more generally. Babbru/pathoru are prepared with flour and fried in mustard oil. Babbru is served with maani/potato/kheer/curd.\n\n[[Kheer]] is a dish prepared from milk by adding some rice and dry fruit in it. It is served at all the special occasions and festivals. Another popular exotic dish is ''guchiyyan'' (dried black [[morel]]), usually added as an ingredient in pulao. As it grows naturally in forests and cannot be cultivated, it is a priced commodity (approx 500 Rs. per 100&nbsp;g) and makes an excelled dish with mountain potatoes (pahadi aloo). [[Saffron]] or kesar is extensively used to flavour sweet dishes and for its anti-oxidant benefits.<ref name=\"dt\">{{cite web |url=http://www.duggartimes.com |title=Index of / |publisher=Duggartimes.com |accessdate=19 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117181654/http://www.duggartimes.com/ |archivedate=17 January 2012  }}</ref>\n\n===Military history===\n\nThe [[Dogra Regiment]] was among the regiments of the [[British Indian Army]], which made significant contributions in both the world wars on all fronts from [[East Asia]] to [[Europe]] and [[North Africa]].

The inscription mentions the Raja of Chamba facing an attack by Kiras aided by the Lord of Durgara (''durg\u0101re\u015bwara''). In medieval times the term ''Durgar'' is believed to have turned into ''Dugar'', eventually transforming to \"Dogra\". Kalhana's ''[[Rajatarangini]]'' makes no mention of a kingdom by any of these names, but the kingdoms could have been referred to by their capital cities (such as ''Vallapura'', modern [[Billawar]], or ''Babbapura'', modern Babor). In modern times, the term Dogra turned into an ethnic identity, claimed by all those people that speak the [[Dogri language]], irrespective of their religion.{{sfn|Handa, Textiles, Costumes, and Ornaments of the Western Himalaya|1998|pp=178\u2013179}}\n\n==History==\nScholar Omachanda Handa believes that the Durgara people were originally migrants from Rajasthan to the [[Terai]] belt, similar to the [[Gurjaras]] (or \"Gujjars\"). The allusion to ''durg'' (fort) in their name indicates that they may have remained a warrior people, eventually founding powerful kingdoms between [[Chenab River|Chenab]] and [[Ravi River|Ravi]], and possibly dominating up to the [[Sutlej River|Sutluj]] river.{{sfn|Handa, Textiles, Costumes, and Ornaments of the Western Himalaya|1998|pp=178\u2013180}}\n\nAccording to [[M. A. Stein]], there were some eleven Dogra states in the region, all of which were eventually absorbed into the [[Jammu]] state, which emerged as the most powerful among them.{{sfn|Stein, Kalhana's Rajatarangini|1900|p=432}} Prior to the rise of Jammu, Babbapura (Babor) is expected to have been the chief state of Dogras. Lying 45 km east of Jammu, Babor contains the ruins of six magnificent temples representing a \"thriving artistic activity\".<ref name=\"Saraf1987\">{{citation |last=Saraf |first=D.

The lower Himalayan ranges begin behind the town of Jammu, which rests on a slope over {{convert|1300|ft}} above sea level, overlooking and commanding the plain watered by the [[Chenab]], [[Ravi River|Ravi]], [[Tawi River|Tawi]] and [[Ujh River|Ujh]] rivers. The Jammu region consists of ten districts: [[Jammu]], [[Kathua]], [[Udhampur]], [[Doda district|Doda]], [[Poonch (town)|Poonch]], [[Kishtwar]], [[Reasi]], [[Samba, Jammu|Samba]], [[Ramban district|Ramban]] and [[Rajouri]]. The city of Jammu is the winter capital of the state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]].\n\nThe Jammu Dogras traditionally inhabited the area between the slopes of the [[Sivalik Hills|Shivalik range]] of mountains, the sacred lakes of Saroien sar and Mannsar but later spread over whole of Jammu region. They generally speak Dogri and other dialects similar to Dogri. The majority of the Dogra are followers of [[Hindu]]ism, but a large number in Jammu and Kashmir believe in other religions. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, some Dogras embraced [[Islam]]. These factors, together with the effects of immigration into the region, have resulted in the Dogra population of Jammu and Kashmir including members of all three religions. \n\nThe [[Dogra dynasty|Dogra Raj]] emerged as a regional power, particularly after Maharaja [[Gulab Singh]] emerged as a warrior and his subjects received special martial recognition from the [[British Raj]]. The rule of Gulab Singh's Raj extended over the whole of the Jammu Region, a large part of the Ladakh region as early as March 1846, and a large part of the Indian Punjab (now [[Himachal Pradesh]]). The [[Kashmir Valley]] was handed over to Gulab Singh by the British government, as part of the territories ceded to the British government by Lahore State according to the provisions of Article IV of the [[Treaty of Lahore]] dated 9{{nbsp}}March 1846. Under the [[Treaty of Amritsar, 1846|Treaty of Amritsar]] in the same year, the Dogra king of Jammu and the state was thereafter known as the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir State (Raj), also thereafter referred as Kashmir State. The term Dogra hence is more akin to the subjects of Himachal Pradesh, some areas of Punjab and the whole region of Jammu that was ruled by Raja Gulab Singh as part of the Dogra Raj irrespective of the religion of the inhabitants.\n\n===Cultural profile===\n* ''Kud'', a ritual dance performed in honour of Lok Devatas. This dance style is performed mostly at night. It is spontaneous and people of all ages and sexes participate. Instruments used during the Kud are Narshingha, chhaina, flute, drumsm etc. The rhythm of music controls the movement of participants. This dance continues for the whole night. The number of participants ranges from 20 to 30 members.\n* ''Heren'', a traditional theatre form performed during the Lohri festival by 10\u201315 people. It is mostly performed in hilly regions of Jammu, Udhampur and ramnagar.\n* ''Fumenie'' and ''Jagarana'', a dance style performed by women on the eve of groom's departure to in-laws house. Both the songs are sung by a group consisting of 15\u201320 members. This traditional dance form depicts the feelings and emotions of women.\n* ''Bakh/Gwatri/Kark/Masade'', a chorus narrative sung by a group of 10 singers without any musical instruments.\n* ''Gwatri'', a singing\u2013dance combined tradition in which the singers narrate some text which is acted by the Gwatari dancers.\n* ''Karak'', a narrative ballet sung by a community called 'Jogies'. They narrate a popular folk tale in their dance style, performed by three members with accompaniment of a typical folk instrument called 'Rabab'.\n* ''Benthe'', the chorus singing tradition performed specific community of tribal called Gujjar and Bakerwal. The dance is performed by 5\u20137 members.<ref>Govt of J&K Website</ref>\n\n==The Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir (Dogra dynasty)==\n{{main|The Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir}}\nThe [[Dogra dynasty]] was a dynasty of [[Hindu]] [[Rajputs]] who ruled [[Jammu & Kashmir]] from 1846 to 1947. They traced their ancestry to the [[Ikshvaku dynasty|Ikshvaku]] (Solar) Dynasty of [[Northern India]] (the same clan in which [[Lord Rama]] was born; he, therefore, is the 'kuldevta' (family deity) of the Dogras). \n[[File:Gulabsingh1840.jpg|thumb|[[Gulab Singh]], the first Maharaja of [[Dogra dynasty|Dogra Rajput dynasty]] which ruled [[Jammu & Kashmir]].]]\n[[File:Sir Hari Singh Bahadur, Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir, 1944.jpg|thumb|[[Maharaja Hari Singh]], the last monarch of [[Dogra dynasty|Dogra Rajput dynasty]] which ruled [[Jammu & Kashmir]].]]\n\nAmong the enlightened rulers of Jammu was Raja Ranjit Dev (1728\u20131780) who introduced certain social reforms such as a ban on '[[Sati (practice)|Sati]]' (immolation of the wife on the funeral pyre of the husband) and female infanticide. Later, under [[Ranjit Singh|Maharaja Ranjit Singh]], the state became part of the [[Sikh Empire]] of the [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] after it was captured from its Afghan rulers. Ranjit Singh rendered this state to his general, [[Maharaja Gulab Singh Jamwal]], who belonged to the Jamwal Rajput clan that ruled Jammu. He extended the boundaries of Jammu to western Tibet with the help of General Zorawar Singh. \n\nThe Sikh Empire rule extended beyond the Jammu Region and the [[Kashmir Valley]] to the Tibetan Buddhist Kingdom of [[Ladakh]] and the Emirates of [[State of Hunza|Hunza]], [[Gilgit Agency|Gilgit]] and [[State of Nagar|Nagar]]. After the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]] in 1846, the British gave Kashmir and the title of 'Maharaja' to [[Gulab Singh]] \u2014 the chief minister \u2014  as a reward for aligning with them against the [[Sikhs]].<ref>Nalwa, V., 2009.

New Delhi: Manohar, p. 220, {{ISBN|81-7304-785-5}}.</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Dogra cuisine===\n\n[[Wheat]], [[maize]] and [[Pearl millet|bajra]] are staple food besides rice, cereals and a tangier preparation made out of mango or tamarind popularly known as ''maani''. The whole dish is called ''dal puth maani'' and is savoured as a combination. ''Mitha madra'' is a favourite and is cooked from milk, dry fruits, and semolina. Preparations of ''rajmash'' (a special variety of red kidney beans); ''auria'' a dish of curd fermented by rye; ''ambal'' made from pumpkin, jaggery and tamarind are favourites, especially during ceremonial cooking. The expert cooks are called ''Siyans'', usually [[Brahmins]]. ''Kalari'' is a milk preserved by cogulation of proteins and then fried in a pan to make it delicious.\n\nNon-vegetarian food was limited to Rajputs and Vaish (Mahajans). 'Khatta meat' is mutton cooked with sour pomegranate seeds (Anardana) or lime juice and flavoured with fumes of a burning charcoal soaked in mustard oil. Keur is one of the well known foods of Dogras. It is prepared by flour and butter and served with sugar and curd. Mostly, it is served to bridegroom at the time of marriage by the in-laws. Kalaari is a favourite food of Dogras in the rainy season. It is prepared by flour mix, cottage cheese and milk cream (malai) with water with help of a small cup shaped pot. Kalari is served with milk. [[Kalari cheese]] is popular in the Jammu region and in Jammu and Kashmir state more generally. Babbru/pathoru are prepared with flour and fried in mustard oil. Babbru is served with maani/potato/kheer/curd.\n\n[[Kheer]] is a dish prepared from milk by adding some rice and dry fruit in it. It is served at all the special occasions and festivals. Another popular exotic dish is ''guchiyyan'' (dried black [[morel]]), usually added as an ingredient in pulao. As it grows naturally in forests and cannot be cultivated, it is a priced commodity (approx 500 Rs. per 100&nbsp;g) and makes an excelled dish with mountain potatoes (pahadi aloo). [[Saffron]] or kesar is extensively used to flavour sweet dishes and for its anti-oxidant benefits.<ref name=\"dt\">{{cite web |url=http://www.duggartimes.com |title=Index of / |publisher=Duggartimes.com |accessdate=19 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117181654/http://www.duggartimes.com/ |archivedate=17 January 2012  }}</ref>\n\n===Military history===\n\nThe [[Dogra Regiment]] was among the regiments of the [[British Indian Army]], which made significant contributions in both the world wars on all fronts from [[East Asia]] to [[Europe]] and [[North Africa]].

The hierarchy represents the latter parts of the life-cycle for each product.\n\n===Life-cycle of a product===\nThe life-cycle begins with design, then proceeds through manufacture, distribution, and primary use and then follows through the waste hierarchy's stages of reduce, reuse and recycle.  Each stage in the life-cycle offers opportunities for policy intervention, to rethink the need for the product, to redesign to minimize waste potential, to extend its use.<ref name=UN/>{{page needed|date=November 2016}} Product life-cycle analysis is a way to optimize the use of the world's limited resources by avoiding the unnecessary generation of waste.\n\n===Resource efficiency===\n[[Resource efficiency]] reflects the understanding that global economic growth and development can not be sustained at current production and consumption patterns. Globally, humanity extracts more resources to produce goods than the planet can replenish.<ref name=UN/>{{page needed|date=November 2016}} Resource efficiency is the reduction of the environmental impact from the production and consumption of these goods, from final raw material extraction to last use and disposal.\n\n===Polluter-pays principle===\nThe [[polluter-pays principle]] mandates that the polluting party pays for the impact on the environment. With respect to waste management, this generally refers to the requirement for a waste generator to pay for appropriate disposal of the unrecoverable material.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/faqs/what-is-the-polluter-pays-principle/|title=What is the polluter pays principle?|last=|first=|website=LSE|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=7 February 2020|date=11 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main article|History of waste management}}\nThroughout most of history, the amount of [[waste]] generated by humans was insignificant due to low [[population density]] and low societal levels of the [[exploitation of natural resources]] as well as industrial since a few decades ago. Common waste produced during pre-modern times was mainly ashes and human [[biodegradable waste]], and these were released back into the ground locally, with minimum [[environmental degradation|environmental impact]]. Tools made out of [[wood]] or [[metal]] were generally reused or passed down through the generations.\n\nHowever, some civilizations do seem to have been more profligate in their waste output than others. In particular, the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] of [[Central America]] had a fixed monthly ritual, in which the people of the village would gather together and burn their rubbish in large dumps.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Barbalace |first=Roberta Crowell |url=http://environmentalchemistry.com/yogi/environmental/wastehistory.html |title=The History of Waste |publisher=EnvironmentalChemistry.com |date=2003-08-01 |accessdate=2013-12-09}}</ref>\n\n===Modern era===\n[[File:SirEdwinChadwick.jpg|thumb|upright|Sir [[Edwin Chadwick]]'s 1842 report ''The Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population'' was influential in securing the passage of the first legislation aimed at waste clearance and disposal.]]\nFollowing the onset of [[industrial revolution|industrialisation]] and the sustained urban growth of large population centres in [[England]], the buildup of waste in the cities caused a rapid deterioration in levels of [[sanitation]] and the general quality of urban life.

The [[Metropolitan Board of Works]] was the first citywide authority that centralized sanitation regulation for the rapidly expanding city and the [[Public Health Act 1875]] made it compulsory for every household to deposit their weekly waste in \"moveable receptacles\" for disposal\u2014the first concept for a dust-bin.<ref name=\"NWRA\">{{cite web|last=National Waste & Recycling Association |url=http://www.environmentalistseveryday.org/publications-solid-waste-industry-research/information/history-of-solid-waste-management/early-america-industrial-revolution.php |title=History of Solid Waste Management |location= Washington, D.C. |accessdate=2013-12-09}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Manlove, Alliott furnace.jpg|thumb|left|[[Manlove, Alliott & Co.

In 1874, the first incinerator was built in [[Nottingham]] by [[Manlove, Alliott & Co.

In 1895, [[New York City]] became the first U.S. city with public-sector garbage management.<ref name=\"NWRA\"/>\n\nEarly [[garbage truck|garbage removal trucks]] were simply open bodied [[dump truck]]s pulled by a team of horses.

The [[Garwood Load Packer]] was the first truck in 1938, to incorporate a hydraulic compactor.\n\n==Waste handling and transport==\n{{main article|Waste collection vehicle|Waste collector|Waste sorting}}\n[[File:Bin.JPG|right|thumb|upright|Moulded plastic, wheeled waste bin in [[Berkshire]], England]]\n\nWaste collection methods vary widely among different countries and regions. Domestic waste collection services are often provided by local government authorities, or by private companies for industrial and commercial waste. Some areas, especially those in less developed countries, do not have formal waste-collection systems.\n\n===Waste handling practices===\n[[Curbside collection]] is the most common method of disposal in most European countries, [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], [[United States]], and many other parts of the developed world in which waste is collected at regular intervals by specialised trucks. This is often associated with curb-side waste segregation. In rural areas waste may need to be taken to a transfer station. Waste collected is then transported to an appropriate disposal facility.\nIn some areas, vacuum collection is used in which waste is transported from the home or commercial premises by vacuum along small bore tubes. Systems are in use in Europe and North America.\n{{main article|Automated vacuum collection}}\nIn some jurisdictions unsegregated waste is collected at the curb-side or from waste transfer stations and then sorted into recyclables and unusable waste. Such systems are capable of sorting large volumes of solid waste, salvaging recyclables, and turning the rest into bio-gas and soil conditioner.\nIn [[San Francisco]], the local government established its ''Mandatory Recycling and Composting Ordinance'' in support of its goal of \"Zero waste by 2020\", requiring everyone in the city to keep recyclables and compostables out of the landfill. The three streams are collected with the curbside \"Fantastic 3\" bin system \u2013 blue for recyclables, green for compostables, and black for landfill-bound materials \u2013 provided to residents and businesses and serviced by San Francisco's sole refuse hauler, Recology. The City's \"Pay-As-You-Throw\" system charges customers by the volume of landfill-bound materials, which provides a financial incentive to separate recyclables and compostables from other discards. The City's Department of the Environment's Zero Waste Program has led the City to achieve 80% diversion, the highest diversion rate in North America.<ref>http://www.siemens.com/entry/cc/features/greencityindex_international/all/en/pdf/report_northamerica_en.pdf</ref> Other businesses such as [[Waste Industries]] use a variety of colors to distinguish between trash and recycling cans.\n\n==Financial models==\nIn most developed countries, domestic waste disposal is funded from a national or local tax which may be related to income, or property values. Commercial and industrial waste disposal is typically charged for as a commercial service, often as an integrated charge which includes disposal costs. This practice may encourage disposal contractors to opt for the cheapest disposal option such as landfill rather than the environmentally best solution such as re-use and recycling.\n\nIn some areas such as [[Taipei]], the city government charges its households and industries for the volume of rubbish they produce. Waste is collected by the city council only if it is put in government issued rubbish bags. This policy has successfully reduced the amount of waste the city produces and increased the recycling rate.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n[[Morocco]] has also seen benefits from implementing a $300 million sanitary [[landfill]] system. While it might appear to be a costly investment, the country's government predicts that it has saved them another $440 million in damages, or consequences of failing to dispose of waste properly.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/09/27/how-the-world-should-cope-with-its-growing-piles-of-rubbish|title=How the world should cope with its growing piles of rubbish|work=The Economist|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Disposal methods==\n\n===Landfill===\n{{main article|Landfill}}\n[[File:Landfill compactor.jpg|thumb|A [[Waste compaction|landfill compaction vehicle]] in action.]]\n[[File:District heating plant spittelau ssw crop1.png|thumb|upright|Spittelau incineration plant in [[Vienna]]]]\n\nA landfill is a site for the disposal of [[waste]] materials by burial. Landfill is the oldest form of [[list of solid waste treatment technologies|waste treatment]], although the burial of the waste is modern; historically, refuse was simply left in piles or thrown into pits. Historically, landfills have been the most common method of organized [[waste disposal]] and remain so in many places around the world.\n\n===Incineration===\n{{main article|Incineration}}\nIncineration is a disposal method in which solid organic wastes are subjected to combustion so as to convert them into residue and gaseous products. This method is useful for disposal of both municipal solid waste and solid residue from waste water treatment. This process reduces the volumes of solid waste by 80 to 95 percent.<ref>http://web.mit.edu/urbanupgrading/urbanenvironment/resources/references/pdfs/DecisionMakers.pdf</ref> Incineration and other high temperature waste treatment systems are sometimes described as \"[[thermal treatment]]\". Incinerators convert waste materials into [[heat]], [[gas]], [[steam]], and [[Incineration#Solid outputs|ash]].\n\nIncineration is carried out both on a small scale by individuals and on a large scale by industry. It is used to dispose of solid, liquid and gaseous waste. It is recognized as a practical method of disposing of certain [[hazardous waste]] materials (such as biological [[medical waste]]). Incineration is a controversial method of waste disposal, due to issues such as emission of gaseous [[pollutants]].\n\nIncineration is common in countries such as [[Japan]] where land is more scarce, as the facilities generally do not require as much area as landfills. [[Waste-to-energy]] (WtE) or energy-from-waste (EfW) are broad terms for facilities that burn waste in a furnace or boiler to generate heat, steam or electricity. Combustion in an incinerator is not always perfect and there have been concerns about pollutants in gaseous emissions from incinerator stacks. Particular concern has focused on some very persistent [[organic compound]]s such as [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxins]], [[furan]]s, and [[Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon|PAH]]s, which may be created and which may have serious environmental consequences.\n\n==Recycling==\n{{main article|Recycling}}\n[[File:Sign. Mahabalipuram.jpg|thumb|Waste not the Waste. Sign in [[Tamil Nadu]], India]]\n[[File:Steel recycling bales.jpg|thumb|Steel crushed and baled for recycling]]\nRecycling is a [[resource recovery]] practice that refers to the collection and reuse of waste materials such as empty beverage containers. The materials from which the items are made can be reprocessed into new products. Material for recycling may be collected separately from general waste using dedicated bins and collection vehicles, a procedure called [[kerbside collection]]. In some communities, the owner of the waste is required to separate the materials into different bins (e.g. for paper, plastics, metals) prior to its collection. In other communities, all recyclable materials are placed in a single bin for collection, and the sorting is handled later at a central facility. The latter method is known as \"[[single-stream recycling]].\"<ref>City of Chicago, Illinois. Department of Streets and Sanitation.

These items are usually composed of a single type of material, making them relatively easy to recycle into new products. The recycling of complex products (such as computers and electronic equipment) is more difficult, due to the additional dismantling and separation required.\n\nThe type of  material accepted for recycling varies by city and country. Each city and country has different recycling programs in place that can handle the various types of recyclable materials.  However, certain variation in acceptance is reflected in the resale value of the material once it is reprocessed. In July 2017, the Chinese government announced an import ban of 24 categories of recyclables and solid waste, including plastic, textiles and mixed paper, placing tremendous impact on developed countries globally, which exported directly or indirectly to China.<ref>Walker, T. R. (2018). China's ban on imported plastic waste could be a game changer. Nature, 553(7689), 405-405.</ref>\n\n==Re-use==\n\n===Biological reprocessing===\n{{main article|Composting|Home composting|Anaerobic digestion|Microbial fuel cell}}\n[[File:Compost Heap.jpg|thumb|An active [[compost]] heap.]]\nRecoverable materials that are organic in nature, such as [[Green waste|plant material]], food scraps, and paper products, can be recovered through [[composting]] and digestion processes to [[decompose]] the organic matter. The resulting organic material is then recycled as [[mulch]] or [[compost]] for agricultural or landscaping purposes. In addition, waste gas from the process (such as methane) can be captured and used for generating electricity and heat (CHP/cogeneration) maximising efficiencies. The intention of biological processing in waste management is to control and accelerate the natural process of decomposition of organic matter. (See [[resource recovery]]).\n\n===Energy recovery===\n{{main article|Waste-to-energy}}\nEnergy recovery from waste is the conversion of non-recyclable waste materials into usable heat, electricity, or fuel through a variety of processes, including combustion, gasification, pyrolyzation, anaerobic digestion, and [[landfill gas]] recovery.<ref name=USEPA>{{cite web|publisher=USEPA |year=2014 |title=Energy Recovery from Waste |url=http://www.epa.gov/waste/nonhaz/municipal/wte/}}</ref> This process is often called waste-to-energy. Energy recovery from waste is part of the non-hazardous waste management hierarchy. Using energy recovery to convert non-recyclable waste materials into electricity and heat, generates a renewable energy source and can reduce carbon emissions by offsetting the need for energy from fossil sources as well as reduce methane generation from landfills.<ref name=USEPA/> Globally, waste-to-energy accounts for 16% of waste management.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=New Energy Corporation |year=2014 |title=Waste Hierarchy|url=http://www.newenergycorp.com.au/what-we-do/waste-hierarchy/}}</ref>\n\nThe energy content of waste products can be harnessed directly by using them as a direct combustion fuel, or indirectly by processing them into another type of fuel. Thermal treatment ranges from using waste as a fuel source for cooking or heating and the use of the gas fuel (see above), to fuel for [[boilers]] to generate steam and electricity in a [[turbine]]. [[Pyrolysis]] and [[gasification]] are two related forms of thermal treatment where waste materials are heated to high temperatures with limited [[oxygen]] availability. The process usually occurs in a sealed vessel under high [[pressure]]. Pyrolysis of solid waste converts the material into solid, liquid and gas products. The liquid and gas can be burnt to produce energy or refined into other chemical products (chemical refinery). The solid residue (char) can be further refined into products such as [[activated carbon]]. Gasification and advanced [[Plasma arc gasification]] are used to convert organic materials directly into a synthetic gas ([[syngas]]) composed of [[carbon monoxide]] and [[hydrogen]]. The gas is then burnt to produce electricity and [[steam]].\nAn alternative to pyrolysis is high temperature and pressure supercritical water decomposition (hydrothermal monophasic oxidation).\n\n===Pyrolysis===\n{{main article|Pyrolysis}}\nPyrolysis is often used to convert many types of domestic and industrial residues into a recovered fuel. Different types of waste input (such as plant waste, food waste, tyres) placed in the pyrolysis process potentially yield an alternative to fossil fuels.<ref name=TSEP>{{cite journal |date=September 2017 |title= Potential of pyrolysis processes in the waste management sector | journal=Thermal Science and Engineering Progress |volume=3 | pages=171\u2013197 |doi=10.1016/j.tsep.2017.06.003 | last1 = Czajczy\u0144ska | first1 = D. | last2 = Anguilano | first2 = L. | last3 = Ghazal | first3 = H. | last4 = Krzy\u017cy\u0144ska | first4 = R. | last5 = Reynolds | first5 = A.J. | last6 = Spencer | first6 = N. | last7 = Jouhara | first7 = H.| doi-access = free }}</ref> Pyrolysis is a process of thermo-chemical decomposition of organic materials by heat in the absence of stoichiometric quantities of [[oxygen]]; the decomposition produces various hydrocarbon gases.<ref>Oxford Reference \u2013 Pyrolysis</ref> During pyrolysis, the molecules of object vibrate at high frequencies to an extent that molecules start breaking down.

Pyrolysis of waste wood and plastics can potentially produce fuel. The solids left from pyrolysis contain metals, glass, sand and pyrolysis coke which does not convert to gas.  Compared to the process of incineration, certain types of pyrolysis processes release less harmful by-products that contain alkali metals, sulphur, and chlorine. However, pyrolysis of some waste yields gasses which impact the environment such as HCl and SO<sub>2</sub>.<ref name=WMJ>{{cite journal |date=December 2014 |title= Pyrolysis technologies for municipal solid waste: A review| journal=Waste Management |volume=34 |issue=12 | pages=2466\u20132486 |doi=10.1016/j.wasman.2014.08.004 |pmid= 25256662| last1 = Chen | first1 = Dezhen | last2 = Yin | first2 = Lijie | last3 = Wang | first3 = Huan | last4 = He | first4 = Pinjing}}</ref>\n\n===Resource recovery===\n{{main article|Resource recovery}}\nResource recovery is the systematic diversion of waste, which was intended for disposal, for a specific next use.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=USEPA |year=2012 |title=Frequent Questions |url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/hazard/wastemin/minimize/faqs.htm}}</ref> It is the processing of recyclables to extract or recover materials and resources, or convert to energy.<ref name=Montana>{{cite web |publisher=Government of Montana |year=2012 |title=Resource Recovery |url=http://deq.mt.gov/solidwaste/resourcerecovery.mcpx}}</ref> These activities are performed at a resource recovery facility.<ref name=Montana/> Resource recovery is not only environmentally important, but it is also cost-effective.<ref name=traverse>{{cite web |publisher=Grand Traverse County |year=2006 |title=What is Resource Recovery? |url=http://www.co.grand-traverse.mi.us/departments/resource_recovery/What_is_Resource_Recovery_.htm}}</ref> It decreases the amount of waste for disposal, saves space in landfills, and conserves natural resources.<ref name=traverse/>\n\nResource recovery (as opposed to waste management) uses LCA (life cycle analysis) attempts to offer alternatives to waste management. For mixed MSW (Municipal Solid Waste) a number of broad studies have indicated that administration, source separation and collection followed by reuse and recycling of the non-organic fraction and energy and compost/fertilizer production of the organic material via anaerobic digestion to be the favoured path.\n\nAs an example of how resource recycling can be beneficial, many items thrown away contain metals that can be recycled to create a profit, such as the components in circuit boards.  Wood chippings in pallets and other packaging materials can be recycled to useful products for horticulture. The recycled chips can cover paths, walkways, or arena surfaces.\n\nApplication of rational and consistent waste management practices can yield a range of benefits including:\n# Economic \u2013 Improving economic efficiency through the means of resource use, treatment and disposal and creating markets for recycles can lead to efficient practices in the production and consumption of products and materials resulting in valuable materials being recovered for reuse and the potential for new jobs and new business opportunities.\n# Social \u2013 By reducing adverse impacts on health by proper waste management practises, the resulting consequences are more appealing civic communities.

The standard encourages companies to improve their environmental efficiencies each year by eliminating waste through [[resource recovery]] practices. One way to do this is by adopting resource recovery practices like [[recycling]] materials such as glass, food scraps, paper and cardboard, [[plastic bottle]]s and metal.  Recycled materials can often be sold to the [[construction industry]]. Many inorganic waste streams can be used to produce materials for construction. Concrete and bricks can be recycled as artificial gravel.

The hierarchy represents the latter parts of the life-cycle for each product.\n\n===Life-cycle of a product===\nThe life-cycle begins with design, then proceeds through manufacture, distribution, and primary use and then follows through the waste hierarchy's stages of reduce, reuse and recycle.  Each stage in the life-cycle offers opportunities for policy intervention, to rethink the need for the product, to redesign to minimize waste potential, to extend its use.<ref name=UN/>{{page needed|date=November 2016}} Product life-cycle analysis is a way to optimize the use of the world's limited resources by avoiding the unnecessary generation of waste.\n\n===Resource efficiency===\n[[Resource efficiency]] reflects the understanding that global economic growth and development can not be sustained at current production and consumption patterns.

Common waste produced during pre-modern times was mainly ashes and human [[biodegradable waste]], and these were released back into the ground locally, with minimum [[environmental degradation|environmental impact]]. Tools made out of [[wood]] or [[metal]] were generally reused or passed down through the generations.\n\nHowever, some civilizations do seem to have been more profligate in their waste output than others. In particular, the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] of [[Central America]] had a fixed monthly ritual, in which the people of the village would gather together and burn their rubbish in large dumps.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Barbalace |first=Roberta Crowell |url=http://environmentalchemistry.com/yogi/environmental/wastehistory.html |title=The History of Waste |publisher=EnvironmentalChemistry.com |date=2003-08-01 |accessdate=2013-12-09}}</ref>\n\n===Modern era===\n[[File:SirEdwinChadwick.jpg|thumb|upright|Sir [[Edwin Chadwick]]'s 1842 report ''The Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population'' was influential in securing the passage of the first legislation aimed at waste clearance and disposal.]]\nFollowing the onset of [[industrial revolution|industrialisation]] and the sustained urban growth of large population centres in [[England]], the buildup of waste in the cities caused a rapid deterioration in levels of [[sanitation]] and the general quality of urban life.

The [[Garwood Load Packer]] was the first truck in 1938, to incorporate a hydraulic compactor.\n\n==Waste handling and transport==\n{{main article|Waste collection vehicle|Waste collector|Waste sorting}}\n[[File:Bin.JPG|right|thumb|upright|Moulded plastic, wheeled waste bin in [[Berkshire]], England]]\n\nWaste collection methods vary widely among different countries and regions. Domestic waste collection services are often provided by local government authorities, or by private companies for industrial and commercial waste. Some areas, especially those in less developed countries, do not have formal waste-collection systems.\n\n===Waste handling practices===\n[[Curbside collection]] is the most common method of disposal in most European countries, [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], [[United States]], and many other parts of the developed world in which waste is collected at regular intervals by specialised trucks. This is often associated with curb-side waste segregation. In rural areas waste may need to be taken to a transfer station. Waste collected is then transported to an appropriate disposal facility.\nIn some areas, vacuum collection is used in which waste is transported from the home or commercial premises by vacuum along small bore tubes. Systems are in use in Europe and North America.\n{{main article|Automated vacuum collection}}\nIn some jurisdictions unsegregated waste is collected at the curb-side or from waste transfer stations and then sorted into recyclables and unusable waste. Such systems are capable of sorting large volumes of solid waste, salvaging recyclables, and turning the rest into bio-gas and soil conditioner.\nIn [[San Francisco]], the local government established its ''Mandatory Recycling and Composting Ordinance'' in support of its goal of \"Zero waste by 2020\", requiring everyone in the city to keep recyclables and compostables out of the landfill. The three streams are collected with the curbside \"Fantastic 3\" bin system \u2013 blue for recyclables, green for compostables, and black for landfill-bound materials \u2013 provided to residents and businesses and serviced by San Francisco's sole refuse hauler, Recology. The City's \"Pay-As-You-Throw\" system charges customers by the volume of landfill-bound materials, which provides a financial incentive to separate recyclables and compostables from other discards. The City's Department of the Environment's Zero Waste Program has led the City to achieve 80% diversion, the highest diversion rate in North America.<ref>http://www.siemens.com/entry/cc/features/greencityindex_international/all/en/pdf/report_northamerica_en.pdf</ref> Other businesses such as [[Waste Industries]] use a variety of colors to distinguish between trash and recycling cans.\n\n==Financial models==\nIn most developed countries, domestic waste disposal is funded from a national or local tax which may be related to income, or property values. Commercial and industrial waste disposal is typically charged for as a commercial service, often as an integrated charge which includes disposal costs. This practice may encourage disposal contractors to opt for the cheapest disposal option such as landfill rather than the environmentally best solution such as re-use and recycling.\n\nIn some areas such as [[Taipei]], the city government charges its households and industries for the volume of rubbish they produce. Waste is collected by the city council only if it is put in government issued rubbish bags. This policy has successfully reduced the amount of waste the city produces and increased the recycling rate.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n[[Morocco]] has also seen benefits from implementing a $300 million sanitary [[landfill]] system. While it might appear to be a costly investment, the country's government predicts that it has saved them another $440 million in damages, or consequences of failing to dispose of waste properly.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/09/27/how-the-world-should-cope-with-its-growing-piles-of-rubbish|title=How the world should cope with its growing piles of rubbish|work=The Economist|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Disposal methods==\n\n===Landfill===\n{{main article|Landfill}}\n[[File:Landfill compactor.jpg|thumb|A [[Waste compaction|landfill compaction vehicle]] in action.]]\n[[File:District heating plant spittelau ssw crop1.png|thumb|upright|Spittelau incineration plant in [[Vienna]]]]\n\nA landfill is a site for the disposal of [[waste]] materials by burial. Landfill is the oldest form of [[list of solid waste treatment technologies|waste treatment]], although the burial of the waste is modern; historically, refuse was simply left in piles or thrown into pits. Historically, landfills have been the most common method of organized [[waste disposal]] and remain so in many places around the world.\n\n===Incineration===\n{{main article|Incineration}}\nIncineration is a disposal method in which solid organic wastes are subjected to combustion so as to convert them into residue and gaseous products. This method is useful for disposal of both municipal solid waste and solid residue from waste water treatment. This process reduces the volumes of solid waste by 80 to 95 percent.<ref>http://web.mit.edu/urbanupgrading/urbanenvironment/resources/references/pdfs/DecisionMakers.pdf</ref> Incineration and other high temperature waste treatment systems are sometimes described as \"[[thermal treatment]]\". Incinerators convert waste materials into [[heat]], [[gas]], [[steam]], and [[Incineration#Solid outputs|ash]].\n\nIncineration is carried out both on a small scale by individuals and on a large scale by industry. It is used to dispose of solid, liquid and gaseous waste. It is recognized as a practical method of disposing of certain [[hazardous waste]] materials (such as biological [[medical waste]]). Incineration is a controversial method of waste disposal, due to issues such as emission of gaseous [[pollutants]].\n\nIncineration is common in countries such as [[Japan]] where land is more scarce, as the facilities generally do not require as much area as landfills. [[Waste-to-energy]] (WtE) or energy-from-waste (EfW) are broad terms for facilities that burn waste in a furnace or boiler to generate heat, steam or electricity. Combustion in an incinerator is not always perfect and there have been concerns about pollutants in gaseous emissions from incinerator stacks. Particular concern has focused on some very persistent [[organic compound]]s such as [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxins]], [[furan]]s, and [[Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon|PAH]]s, which may be created and which may have serious environmental consequences.\n\n==Recycling==\n{{main article|Recycling}}\n[[File:Sign. Mahabalipuram.jpg|thumb|Waste not the Waste. Sign in [[Tamil Nadu]], India]]\n[[File:Steel recycling bales.jpg|thumb|Steel crushed and baled for recycling]]\nRecycling is a [[resource recovery]] practice that refers to the collection and reuse of waste materials such as empty beverage containers. The materials from which the items are made can be reprocessed into new products. Material for recycling may be collected separately from general waste using dedicated bins and collection vehicles, a procedure called [[kerbside collection]]. In some communities, the owner of the waste is required to separate the materials into different bins (e.g. for paper, plastics, metals) prior to its collection. In other communities, all recyclable materials are placed in a single bin for collection, and the sorting is handled later at a central facility. The latter method is known as \"[[single-stream recycling]].\"<ref>City of Chicago, Illinois. Department of Streets and Sanitation.

These items are usually composed of a single type of material, making them relatively easy to recycle into new products. The recycling of complex products (such as computers and electronic equipment) is more difficult, due to the additional dismantling and separation required.\n\nThe type of  material accepted for recycling varies by city and country. Each city and country has different recycling programs in place that can handle the various types of recyclable materials.  However, certain variation in acceptance is reflected in the resale value of the material once it is reprocessed. In July 2017, the Chinese government announced an import ban of 24 categories of recyclables and solid waste, including plastic, textiles and mixed paper, placing tremendous impact on developed countries globally, which exported directly or indirectly to China.<ref>Walker, T. R. (2018). China's ban on imported plastic waste could be a game changer. Nature, 553(7689), 405-405.</ref>\n\n==Re-use==\n\n===Biological reprocessing===\n{{main article|Composting|Home composting|Anaerobic digestion|Microbial fuel cell}}\n[[File:Compost Heap.jpg|thumb|An active [[compost]] heap.]]\nRecoverable materials that are organic in nature, such as [[Green waste|plant material]], food scraps, and paper products, can be recovered through [[composting]] and digestion processes to [[decompose]] the organic matter. The resulting organic material is then recycled as [[mulch]] or [[compost]] for agricultural or landscaping purposes. In addition, waste gas from the process (such as methane) can be captured and used for generating electricity and heat (CHP/cogeneration) maximising efficiencies. The intention of biological processing in waste management is to control and accelerate the natural process of decomposition of organic matter. (See [[resource recovery]]).\n\n===Energy recovery===\n{{main article|Waste-to-energy}}\nEnergy recovery from waste is the conversion of non-recyclable waste materials into usable heat, electricity, or fuel through a variety of processes, including combustion, gasification, pyrolyzation, anaerobic digestion, and [[landfill gas]] recovery.<ref name=USEPA>{{cite web|publisher=USEPA |year=2014 |title=Energy Recovery from Waste |url=http://www.epa.gov/waste/nonhaz/municipal/wte/}}</ref> This process is often called waste-to-energy. Energy recovery from waste is part of the non-hazardous waste management hierarchy. Using energy recovery to convert non-recyclable waste materials into electricity and heat, generates a renewable energy source and can reduce carbon emissions by offsetting the need for energy from fossil sources as well as reduce methane generation from landfills.<ref name=USEPA/> Globally, waste-to-energy accounts for 16% of waste management.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=New Energy Corporation |year=2014 |title=Waste Hierarchy|url=http://www.newenergycorp.com.au/what-we-do/waste-hierarchy/}}</ref>\n\nThe energy content of waste products can be harnessed directly by using them as a direct combustion fuel, or indirectly by processing them into another type of fuel. Thermal treatment ranges from using waste as a fuel source for cooking or heating and the use of the gas fuel (see above), to fuel for [[boilers]] to generate steam and electricity in a [[turbine]]. [[Pyrolysis]] and [[gasification]] are two related forms of thermal treatment where waste materials are heated to high temperatures with limited [[oxygen]] availability. The process usually occurs in a sealed vessel under high [[pressure]]. Pyrolysis of solid waste converts the material into solid, liquid and gas products. The liquid and gas can be burnt to produce energy or refined into other chemical products (chemical refinery). The solid residue (char) can be further refined into products such as [[activated carbon]].

For mixed MSW (Municipal Solid Waste) a number of broad studies have indicated that administration, source separation and collection followed by reuse and recycling of the non-organic fraction and energy and compost/fertilizer production of the organic material via anaerobic digestion to be the favoured path.\n\nAs an example of how resource recycling can be beneficial, many items thrown away contain metals that can be recycled to create a profit, such as the components in circuit boards.  Wood chippings in pallets and other packaging materials can be recycled to useful products for horticulture. The recycled chips can cover paths, walkways, or arena surfaces.\n\nApplication of rational and consistent waste management practices can yield a range of benefits including:\n# Economic \u2013 Improving economic efficiency through the means of resource use, treatment and disposal and creating markets for recycles can lead to efficient practices in the production and consumption of products and materials resulting in valuable materials being recovered for reuse and the potential for new jobs and new business opportunities.\n# Social \u2013 By reducing adverse impacts on health by proper waste management practises, the resulting consequences are more appealing civic communities.  Better social advantages can lead to new sources of employment and potentially lifting communities out of poverty especially in some of the developing poorer countries and cities.\n# Environmental \u2013 Reducing or eliminating adverse impacts on the environment through reducing, reusing and recycling, and minimizing resource extraction can result in improved air and water quality and help in the reduction of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.\n# Inter-generational Equity \u2013 Following effective waste management practises can provide subsequent generations a more robust economy, a fairer and more [[social inclusion|inclusive society]] and a cleaner environment.<ref name=UN/>{{page needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Sustainability===\nThe management of waste is a key component in a business' ability to maintain [[ISO14001]] accreditation. The standard encourages companies to improve their environmental efficiencies each year by eliminating waste through [[resource recovery]] practices. One way to do this is by adopting resource recovery practices like [[recycling]] materials such as glass, food scraps, paper and cardboard, [[plastic bottle]]s and metal.  Recycled materials can often be sold to the [[construction industry]]. Many inorganic waste streams can be used to produce materials for construction. Concrete and bricks can be recycled as artificial gravel.

It was the third [[wide-body airliner]] to enter commercial operations, after the [[Boeing 747]] and the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]]. The [[airliner]] has a seating capacity of up to 400 passengers and a range of over {{convert|4000|nmi|km|sigfig=3|lk=on}}. Its trijet configuration has three [[Rolls-Royce RB211]] engines with one engine under each wing, along with a third engine center-mounted with an [[S-duct]] air inlet embedded in the tail and the upper [[fuselage]]. The aircraft has an [[autoland]] capability, an automated descent control system, and available lower deck [[Galley (kitchen)|galley]] and lounge facilities.\n\nThe L-1011 TriStar was produced in two fuselage lengths. The original L-1011-1 first flew in November 1970 and entered service with [[Eastern Air Lines]] in 1972. The shortened, longer range L-1011-500 first flew in 1978 and entered service with [[British Airways]] a year later. The original-length TriStar was also produced as the high [[gross weight]] L-1011-100, up-rated engine L-1011-200, and further upgraded L-1011-250. Post-production conversions for the L-1011-1 with increased takeoff weights included the L-1011-50 and L-1011-150.\n \nThe L-1011 TriStar's sales were hampered by two years of delays due to developmental and financial problems at [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]], the sole manufacturer of the aircraft's engines. Between 1968 and 1984, Lockheed manufactured a total of 250 TriStars, assembled at the Lockheed plant located at the [[Palmdale Regional Airport]] in southern [[California]] north of [[Los Angeles]]. After production ended, Lockheed withdrew from the commercial aircraft business due to its below-target sales.<ref name=\"withdraw_from_civil_aviation\">Greenwald, John, Jerry Hannifin and Joseph J.

However, the weight problems affected the weight and desirability of early production L-1011-1 aircraft, known as Group 1 (serial numbers 1002 through to 1012).\n\nGroup 1 aircraft have an [[OEW]] of {{convert|252700|lb|kg}}, about {{convert|12700|lb|kg}} higher than later aircraft, while Group 2 aircraft (serial numbers 1013 through 1051) have an OEW of {{convert|247000|lb|kg}}, some {{convert|4700|lb|kg}} lower. These aircraft, in general, also have different center of gravity envelopes with the forward center of gravity limit on the early aircraft being more restrictive at higher gross weights. Groups 1 and 2 aircraft (serial numbers 1002 to 1051) are upgradeable only to -50 or -150 specifications, although the Group 1 aircraft (up to serial number 1012) still maintain their operating disadvantages. All L-1011-1 aircraft from serial number 1052 onwards are Group 3 aircraft and are fully upgradeable to all variants up to -250 specification.\n\n[[File:British Airways Lockheed L-1011-385-1 TriStar 1 Gilliand.jpg|thumb|[[British Airways]] L-1011-385 TriStar in Landor livery in 1986]]\nUnder state control, costs at Rolls-Royce were tightly controlled and their efforts largely went into the original TriStar engines, which needed considerable modifications between the L-1011's first flight and service entry. The competition, notably General Electric, was very quick to develop their [[General Electric CF6|CF6]] engine with more thrust, which meant that a heavier \"intercontinental\" DC-10-30 could be more quickly brought to market. The flexibility afforded to potential customers by a long-range DC-10 put the L-1011 at a serious disadvantage. Rolls-Royce went on to develop the high-thrust [[Rolls-Royce RB211#RB211-524 series|RB211-524]] for the L-1011-200 and -500, but this took many years.<ref>[http://www.emeraldinsight.com/Insight/viewContentItem.do?contentType=Article&hdAction=lnkpdf&contentId=1682587 \"Engine Update.\"] ''Aircraft Engineering and Aerospace Technology,'' Volume 48, 1976, p. 5.</ref>\n\nThe resultant delay in Lockheed and Rolls-Royce offering a high gross variant with a longer range, coupled with the TriStar's delayed introduction, meant that only 250 TriStars were sold compared to some 400 DC-10s.<ref name=\"airlinereporter.com\"/> Lockheed needed to sell 500 airliners to break even, but in 1981, the company announced production would end with the delivery of the 250th and last L-1011 on order in 1984.<ref>Jones, Jack.

Lockheed lacked the resources to follow up with several proposals based on the TriStar wing and airframe, including a wide-body twinjet and a stretched quad-jet (one of the quadjet proposals consisting of two underwing engines and two rear fuselage-mounted engines). McDonnell Douglas was also financially weakened and could only develop the [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11|MD-11]], a refinement of the DC-10, instead of an all-new design to challenge the next generation of twinjets like the [[Boeing 777]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Lockheed L-1011 Tristar simulator cockpit RAF museum.jpg|thumb|The L-1011 TriStar's three-crew flight deck]]\n[[File:TWA Lockheed L-1011 Tristar coach cabin.jpg|thumb|Coach cabin of a [[TWA]] L-1011 TriStar in 2\u20135\u20132 layout]]\n{{expand section|date=September 2016}}\n\nThe L-1011 featured a highly advanced [[autopilot]] system and was the first widebody to receive [[FAA]] certification for [[Instrument Landing System#ILS categories|Cat-IIIc]] [[autoland]]ing, which approved the TriStar for completely [[instrument meteorological conditions|blind]] landings performed by the aircraft's autopilot in zero-[[visibility]] weather.<ref>Young, David.

The -150 involves the conversion of Group 1 and Group 2 L-1011-1 aircraft to an MTOW of {{convert|470000|lb|kg}}, an increase of {{convert|40000|lb|kg}}, about 10%, from the L-1011-1, giving the aircraft a slightly better range than the -50, but without the additional center-section fuel tank, less than the L-1011-100 aircraft.  The first aircraft was converted by [[Messerschmitt-B\u00f6lkow-Blohm|MBB]] at Lemwerder in Germany during the winter of 1988/89 and was subsequently handed over to [[Air Transat]] of Canada on May 11, 1989.\n\n===L-1011-200===\n[[File:Saudi Arabian Airlines L-1011-200 HZ-AHE LHR 1985-5-17.png|thumb|A [[Saudia]] L-1011-200 TriStar at [[London Heathrow Airport]], 1985]]\n\nThe L-1011-200 (FAA certification L-1011-385-1-15), the third production model of the L-1011, was introduced in 1976. Although otherwise similar to the -100, the -200 uses [[Rolls-Royce RB.211]]-524B engines to improve its performance in hot and high-altitude conditions. Gulf Air used -200 models to replace its earlier-generation [[Vickers VC10]] fleet.\n\nOther than the engines, the basic TriStar -200 is identical to the -100, with center-section fuel, having a MTOW of {{convert|466000|lb|kg}}, and fuel capacity of {{convert|26400|usgal|l}} as the -100. An increase of gross weight to {{convert|474000|lb|kg}} is possible, with the heavier aircraft offered by Lockheed as -200I or -200(Improved).  [[Saudi Arabian Airlines]] (Saudia) was a launch customer for the -200 series and operated a sizable fleet until 1998. A total of 24 L-1011-200 aircraft were built new, with the first delivered to Saudia on May 28, 1977.

The more powerful engines, lengthened wing, active-load-control ailerons and other systems that had been developed for the L-1011-500 were adapted into the baseline model.  The changes resulted in increases in maximum takeoff weight to {{convert|510000|lb|kg}} and fuel capacity from 23,600&nbsp;US gal (89,335&nbsp;l) to 31,632&nbsp;US gal (119,735&nbsp;l). This variant also used the upgraded [[Rolls-Royce RB211|RB211-524B4I]] engine, which could be easily retrofitted to the existing [[Rolls-Royce RB211|RB211-524B]] powerplants of the L-1011-200, but it required a re-engining on the L-1011-1 and L-1011-100, which used the original RB211-22B. The conversion allowed the L-1011 to match the performance of the long-range McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30. Although it applied to all L-1011 models, the upgrade was only undertaken by Delta on six late-model L-1011-1 aircraft.\n\n===L-1011-500===\n[[File:TAP Air Portugal L-1011-500 CS-TEF LIS 1988-6-30.png|thumb|A [[TAP Air Portugal]] L-1011-500 departing from [[Lisbon Portela Airport]] in 1988]]\n\nThe L-1011-500 (FAA certification L-1011-385-3) was the last L-1011 variant to enter production. It was a longer-range variant first flight-tested in 1978. Its fuselage length was shortened by {{convert|14|ft|m}} and MTOW increased to allow higher fuel loads.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} More powerful RB.211-524 engines, increased wingspan, active-load-control ailerons and other improved systems were features introduced by Lockheed to exploit newly available technologies in the late 1970s. The -500 variant was popular among international operators and formed a significant portion of the L-1011 fleet of Delta and British Airways. However, its late introduction resulted in many potential customers buying the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10#Longer-range variants|DC-10-30]] instead.\n\nThe TriStar 500 first flew on October 16, 1978, with the first delivery to British Airways on April 27, 1979. It entered service with British Airways on May 7, 1979, flying between London and Abu Dhabi.\n\n====Dimensions====\nThe TriStar 500 has an overall length of {{convert|164|ft|2|in|m|2}} and wingspan increased to {{convert|164|ft|4|in|m|2}} (early TriStar versions originally had the TriStar 1 wing with a span of {{convert|155|ft|4|in|m|2}}).\n\n====Flying surfaces====\nLockheed developed some aerodynamic improvements for the TriStar 500 which included a modified wing-to-body fairing, a fillet below the central intake, extended wingtips, and \"active ailerons\" or active control system (ACS). The new fairing reduced drag, while the fillet reduced noise in the rear cabin. The wingtip extensions increased aspect ratio, thus reducing induced drag, but resulted in increased bending. The ACS developed to solve this, provided gust alleviation, improving ride during flight, reduced fuel burn, and increased fatigue life.\n\nEarlier TriStar 500s were delivered with the standard wing; these were later retrofitted with ailerons and extended wingtips. Pan Am was the first customer to order the -500 with the extended wingtips and active ailerons. Aircraft serial number 1176, the first for Pan Am, was the first TriStar 500 to be fitted with them as standard.\n\n====Powerplant====\n[[File:Lockheed L-1011-385-3 TriStar 500, AirLanka AN0962210.jpg|thumb|An [[SriLankan Airlines|Air Lanka]] L-1011-500 TriStar ferrying an extra engine.]]\nThe TriStar 500 is equipped with the more powerful RB211-524B engines. Initially rated at {{convert|50000|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} thrust each, the higher-thrust {{convert|53000|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} -524B4 Improved (also referred to as the -524B4I) later became available, which also offered improved fuel efficiency.\n\n====Performance====\nOriginally certified with an MTOW of {{convert|496000|lb|kg}}, an increased MTOW of {{convert|504000|lb|kg}} was later certified in 1979, and all earlier production aircraft were certified at this weight. A further increase, to {{convert|510000|lb|kg}}, is also available, and most TriStar 500s are thought to have had this increase. Standard fuel capacity is {{convert|31600|USgal|l}}, giving the TriStar 500 a range of about {{convert|5200|nmi|km}} with 246 passengers and baggage.\n\n====Cabin====\nThe TriStar 500's maximum passenger capacity is 315, although no aircraft were operated with that number of seats.  A typical two-class layout might include 21 First Class and 229 Economy Class for a maximum of 250 passengers. More spacious three-class layouts used on longer routes include 233 with 12 First Class, 32 Business Class, and 189 Economy Class with Delta Air Lines.  The aircraft is equipped with six exits, two fewer than the long-body TriStars, thus reducing the exit limit maximum.\n\n==Operators==\n{{main|List of Lockheed L-1011 operators}}\n[[File:Side view of L-1011 carrying Pegasus XL rocket..jpg|thumb|[[Northrop Grumman]]'s [[Stargazer (aircraft)|''Stargazer'']] is the only L-1011 still in service as of October 2019]]\n\nThe last remaining L-1011 TriStar in service as of 2019 is the [[Stargazer (aircraft)|Stargazer]] air-launch mothership, operated by [[Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems]] (formerly Orbital ATK).<ref>[http://www.orbital.com/LaunchSystems/SpaceLaunchVehicles/Pegasus/L-1011/ \"Pegasus/L-1011.\"] ''Orbital ATK'', 2015.

It was the third [[wide-body airliner]] to enter commercial operations, after the [[Boeing 747]] and the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]]. The [[airliner]] has a seating capacity of up to 400 passengers and a range of over {{convert|4000|nmi|km|sigfig=3|lk=on}}. Its trijet configuration has three [[Rolls-Royce RB211]] engines with one engine under each wing, along with a third engine center-mounted with an [[S-duct]] air inlet embedded in the tail and the upper [[fuselage]]. The aircraft has an [[autoland]] capability, an automated descent control system, and available lower deck [[Galley (kitchen)|galley]] and lounge facilities.\n\nThe L-1011 TriStar was produced in two fuselage lengths. The original L-1011-1 first flew in November 1970 and entered service with [[Eastern Air Lines]] in 1972. The shortened, longer range L-1011-500 first flew in 1978 and entered service with [[British Airways]] a year later. The original-length TriStar was also produced as the high [[gross weight]] L-1011-100, up-rated engine L-1011-200, and further upgraded L-1011-250. Post-production conversions for the L-1011-1 with increased takeoff weights included the L-1011-50 and L-1011-150.\n \nThe L-1011 TriStar's sales were hampered by two years of delays due to developmental and financial problems at [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]], the sole manufacturer of the aircraft's engines. Between 1968 and 1984, Lockheed manufactured a total of 250 TriStars, assembled at the Lockheed plant located at the [[Palmdale Regional Airport]] in southern [[California]] north of [[Los Angeles]]. After production ended, Lockheed withdrew from the commercial aircraft business due to its below-target sales.<ref name=\"withdraw_from_civil_aviation\">Greenwald, John, Jerry Hannifin and Joseph J.

In the 1950s the Electra was designed for turboprop propulsion, which Lockheed had successfully used on the [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130 Hercules]] military transport. Even after the Electra overcame vibration problems that caused several crashes early in its career, the market for large airliners would soon shift over to jet airliners such as the [[Boeing 707]] and [[Douglas DC-8]].<ref>[http://www.airdisaster.com/cgi-bin/view_details.cgi?date=09291959\u00ae=N9705C&airline=Braniff+Airlines \"Accident Synopsis 09291959.\"] AirDisaster.com, 2008.

Boeing lost the military contract, but its private-venture 747 captured what would become a much larger civilian airliner market for [[wide-body aircraft|wide-body]] airliners.\n\nHaving experienced difficulties with some of their military programs, Lockheed was eager to re-enter the civilian market with a smaller wide-body jet, and their response was the L-1011 TriStar. Douglas Aircraft answered American Airlines with the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|DC-10]], which had a similar three-engine configuration and dimensions.<ref name=\"Lockheed L-1011.\">[https://www.pbs.org/kcet/chasingthesun/planes/l1011.html \"Lockheed L-1011.\"] ''Chasing the Sun (PBS).''

McDonnell, who had recently taken over Douglas Aircraft, directed DC-10 development on a \"very firm budget, and cost overruns were unacceptable{{Snd}} even at the expense of safety\", and the conservative approach meant reusing [[Douglas DC-8]] technology. By contrast, Lockheed would \"take the most advanced technology of the day and when that technology was lacking, Lockheed created it\" for the L-1011<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.airlinereporter.com/2015/09/requiem-trijet-masterpiece-lockheed-l-1011-tristar/ |title = Requiem for a Trijet Masterpiece - the Lockheed L-1011|date = 2015-09-30}}</ref> in order to give it lower noise emissions (in the early 1970s, [[Eastern Air Lines]] nicknamed the L-1011 \"WhisperLiner\"), improved reliability, and higher efficiency over first-generation jet airliners. The TriStar name was selected in a Lockheed employee naming contest for the airliner.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}  The advanced technology that went into the TriStar resulted in a high purchase price. It has been said {{by whom|date=January 2020}}  that \"airlines could get a 747 for slightly more, or a DC-10 for a good deal less\".<ref name=\"airlinereporter.com\"/>\n\nThe TriStar's design featured a twin-aisle interior with a maximum of 400 passengers and a three-engine layout. The TriStar was originally conceived as a \"jumbo twin\", but a three-engine design was ultimately chosen to give the aircraft enough thrust to take off from existing runways.<ref name=\"Lockheed L-1011.\"/> Also, before the establishment of [[ETOPS|Extended Operations]] standards by the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] in the 1980s, commercial jets with only two engines were not allowed to fly more than 30 minutes away from an airport, making trans-oceanic flights impossible. The main visible difference between the TriStar and its similar trijet competitor, the McDonnell Douglas DC-10, is the central tail engine configuration: the DC-10's engine is mounted above the fuselage for simplicity of design and more economical construction, while the TriStar's engine is mounted to the rear fuselage and fed through an [[S-duct]] (similar to the [[Boeing 727]]) for reduced drag and improved stability.<ref name=\"airlinereporter.com\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.airlinereporter.com/2014/03/lockheed-l1011-saying-goodbye-another-trijet/ |title = The Lockheed L1011 - Saying Goodbye to Another Trijet|date = 2014-03-24}}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=bEdWAAAAMAAJ&q=s-duct&dq=s-duct&pgis=1 ''The Aeronautical Journal, Volume 78.''] ''Royal Aeronautical Society,'' 1974, pp. 392, 398.

The TriStar was manufactured in Lockheed facilities in Burbank and [[Palmdale, California]].\n\nLockheed discovered fairly early on that the TriStar suffered from higher than estimated structural weight, engine weight, and specific fuel consumption. To rectify this problem and to meet performance guarantees, Lockheed developed a structural kit that allowed [[maximum takeoff weight]] (MTOW) to be increased on production aircraft from {{convert|409000|to|430000|lb|kg}}. However, the weight problems affected the weight and desirability of early production L-1011-1 aircraft, known as Group 1 (serial numbers 1002 through to 1012).\n\nGroup 1 aircraft have an [[OEW]] of {{convert|252700|lb|kg}}, about {{convert|12700|lb|kg}} higher than later aircraft, while Group 2 aircraft (serial numbers 1013 through 1051) have an OEW of {{convert|247000|lb|kg}}, some {{convert|4700|lb|kg}} lower. These aircraft, in general, also have different center of gravity envelopes with the forward center of gravity limit on the early aircraft being more restrictive at higher gross weights. Groups 1 and 2 aircraft (serial numbers 1002 to 1051) are upgradeable only to -50 or -150 specifications, although the Group 1 aircraft (up to serial number 1012) still maintain their operating disadvantages. All L-1011-1 aircraft from serial number 1052 onwards are Group 3 aircraft and are fully upgradeable to all variants up to -250 specification.\n\n[[File:British Airways Lockheed L-1011-385-1 TriStar 1 Gilliand.jpg|thumb|[[British Airways]] L-1011-385 TriStar in Landor livery in 1986]]\nUnder state control, costs at Rolls-Royce were tightly controlled and their efforts largely went into the original TriStar engines, which needed considerable modifications between the L-1011's first flight and service entry. The competition, notably General Electric, was very quick to develop their [[General Electric CF6|CF6]] engine with more thrust, which meant that a heavier \"intercontinental\" DC-10-30 could be more quickly brought to market. The flexibility afforded to potential customers by a long-range DC-10 put the L-1011 at a serious disadvantage. Rolls-Royce went on to develop the high-thrust [[Rolls-Royce RB211#RB211-524 series|RB211-524]] for the L-1011-200 and -500, but this took many years.<ref>[http://www.emeraldinsight.com/Insight/viewContentItem.do?contentType=Article&hdAction=lnkpdf&contentId=1682587 \"Engine Update.\"] ''Aircraft Engineering and Aerospace Technology,'' Volume 48, 1976, p. 5.</ref>\n\nThe resultant delay in Lockheed and Rolls-Royce offering a high gross variant with a longer range, coupled with the TriStar's delayed introduction, meant that only 250 TriStars were sold compared to some 400 DC-10s.<ref name=\"airlinereporter.com\"/> Lockheed needed to sell 500 airliners to break even, but in 1981, the company announced production would end with the delivery of the 250th and last L-1011 on order in 1984.<ref>Jones, Jack.

Lockheed lacked the resources to follow up with several proposals based on the TriStar wing and airframe, including a wide-body twinjet and a stretched quad-jet (one of the quadjet proposals consisting of two underwing engines and two rear fuselage-mounted engines).

The -50 was available only as a conversion package for the L-1011-1 and was never built new.\n\n===L-1011-150===\nThe L-1011-150 was a development of the L-1011-1 with its maximum takeoff weight increased to {{convert|470000|lb|kg}}. It was available only as a conversion for the L-1011-1. The -150 involves the conversion of Group 1 and Group 2 L-1011-1 aircraft to an MTOW of {{convert|470000|lb|kg}}, an increase of {{convert|40000|lb|kg}}, about 10%, from the L-1011-1, giving the aircraft a slightly better range than the -50, but without the additional center-section fuel tank, less than the L-1011-100 aircraft.  The first aircraft was converted by [[Messerschmitt-B\u00f6lkow-Blohm|MBB]] at Lemwerder in Germany during the winter of 1988/89 and was subsequently handed over to [[Air Transat]] of Canada on May 11, 1989.\n\n===L-1011-200===\n[[File:Saudi Arabian Airlines L-1011-200 HZ-AHE LHR 1985-5-17.png|thumb|A [[Saudia]] L-1011-200 TriStar at [[London Heathrow Airport]], 1985]]\n\nThe L-1011-200 (FAA certification L-1011-385-1-15), the third production model of the L-1011, was introduced in 1976. Although otherwise similar to the -100, the -200 uses [[Rolls-Royce RB.211]]-524B engines to improve its performance in hot and high-altitude conditions. Gulf Air used -200 models to replace its earlier-generation [[Vickers VC10]] fleet.\n\nOther than the engines, the basic TriStar -200 is identical to the -100, with center-section fuel, having a MTOW of {{convert|466000|lb|kg}}, and fuel capacity of {{convert|26400|usgal|l}} as the -100. An increase of gross weight to {{convert|474000|lb|kg}} is possible, with the heavier aircraft offered by Lockheed as -200I or -200(Improved).  [[Saudi Arabian Airlines]] (Saudia) was a launch customer for the -200 series and operated a sizable fleet until 1998. A total of 24 L-1011-200 aircraft were built new, with the first delivered to Saudia on May 28, 1977. Like other TriStar improvements, a conversion program has also been offered.\n\n===L-1011-250===\n[[File:Lockheed L-1011-250 Tristar, Delta Air Lines JP6032824.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Delta Airlines]] L-1011-250 at [[Frankfurt Airport]], 1994]]\n\nThe L-1011-250 was an upgrade developed for late-model L-1011-1 aircraft and all L-1011-100 and L-1011-200 aircraft. The more powerful engines, lengthened wing, active-load-control ailerons and other systems that had been developed for the L-1011-500 were adapted into the baseline model.  The changes resulted in increases in maximum takeoff weight to {{convert|510000|lb|kg}} and fuel capacity from 23,600&nbsp;US gal (89,335&nbsp;l) to 31,632&nbsp;US gal (119,735&nbsp;l). This variant also used the upgraded [[Rolls-Royce RB211|RB211-524B4I]] engine, which could be easily retrofitted to the existing [[Rolls-Royce RB211|RB211-524B]] powerplants of the L-1011-200, but it required a re-engining on the L-1011-1 and L-1011-100, which used the original RB211-22B. The conversion allowed the L-1011 to match the performance of the long-range McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30. Although it applied to all L-1011 models, the upgrade was only undertaken by Delta on six late-model L-1011-1 aircraft.\n\n===L-1011-500===\n[[File:TAP Air Portugal L-1011-500 CS-TEF LIS 1988-6-30.png|thumb|A [[TAP Air Portugal]] L-1011-500 departing from [[Lisbon Portela Airport]] in 1988]]\n\nThe L-1011-500 (FAA certification L-1011-385-3) was the last L-1011 variant to enter production. It was a longer-range variant first flight-tested in 1978. Its fuselage length was shortened by {{convert|14|ft|m}} and MTOW increased to allow higher fuel loads.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} More powerful RB.211-524 engines, increased wingspan, active-load-control ailerons and other improved systems were features introduced by Lockheed to exploit newly available technologies in the late 1970s. The -500 variant was popular among international operators and formed a significant portion of the L-1011 fleet of Delta and British Airways. However, its late introduction resulted in many potential customers buying the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10#Longer-range variants|DC-10-30]] instead.\n\nThe TriStar 500 first flew on October 16, 1978, with the first delivery to British Airways on April 27, 1979. It entered service with British Airways on May 7, 1979, flying between London and Abu Dhabi.\n\n====Dimensions====\nThe TriStar 500 has an overall length of {{convert|164|ft|2|in|m|2}} and wingspan increased to {{convert|164|ft|4|in|m|2}} (early TriStar versions originally had the TriStar 1 wing with a span of {{convert|155|ft|4|in|m|2}}).\n\n====Flying surfaces====\nLockheed developed some aerodynamic improvements for the TriStar 500 which included a modified wing-to-body fairing, a fillet below the central intake, extended wingtips, and \"active ailerons\" or active control system (ACS). The new fairing reduced drag, while the fillet reduced noise in the rear cabin. The wingtip extensions increased aspect ratio, thus reducing induced drag, but resulted in increased bending. The ACS developed to solve this, provided gust alleviation, improving ride during flight, reduced fuel burn, and increased fatigue life.\n\nEarlier TriStar 500s were delivered with the standard wing; these were later retrofitted with ailerons and extended wingtips. Pan Am was the first customer to order the -500 with the extended wingtips and active ailerons. Aircraft serial number 1176, the first for Pan Am, was the first TriStar 500 to be fitted with them as standard.\n\n====Powerplant====\n[[File:Lockheed L-1011-385-3 TriStar 500, AirLanka AN0962210.jpg|thumb|An [[SriLankan Airlines|Air Lanka]] L-1011-500 TriStar ferrying an extra engine.]]\nThe TriStar 500 is equipped with the more powerful RB211-524B engines. Initially rated at {{convert|50000|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} thrust each, the higher-thrust {{convert|53000|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} -524B4 Improved (also referred to as the -524B4I) later became available, which also offered improved fuel efficiency.\n\n====Performance====\nOriginally certified with an MTOW of {{convert|496000|lb|kg}}, an increased MTOW of {{convert|504000|lb|kg}} was later certified in 1979, and all earlier production aircraft were certified at this weight. A further increase, to {{convert|510000|lb|kg}}, is also available, and most TriStar 500s are thought to have had this increase. Standard fuel capacity is {{convert|31600|USgal|l}}, giving the TriStar 500 a range of about {{convert|5200|nmi|km}} with 246 passengers and baggage.\n\n====Cabin====\nThe TriStar 500's maximum passenger capacity is 315, although no aircraft were operated with that number of seats.  A typical two-class layout might include 21 First Class and 229 Economy Class for a maximum of 250 passengers. More spacious three-class layouts used on longer routes include 233 with 12 First Class, 32 Business Class, and 189 Economy Class with Delta Air Lines.  The aircraft is equipped with six exits, two fewer than the long-body TriStars, thus reducing the exit limit maximum.\n\n==Operators==\n{{main|List of Lockheed L-1011 operators}}\n[[File:Side view of L-1011 carrying Pegasus XL rocket..jpg|thumb|[[Northrop Grumman]]'s [[Stargazer (aircraft)|''Stargazer'']] is the only L-1011 still in service as of October 2019]]\n\nThe last remaining L-1011 TriStar in service as of 2019 is the [[Stargazer (aircraft)|Stargazer]] air-launch mothership, operated by [[Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems]] (formerly Orbital ATK).<ref>[http://www.orbital.com/LaunchSystems/SpaceLaunchVehicles/Pegasus/L-1011/ \"Pegasus/L-1011.\"] ''Orbital ATK'', 2015.

It was founded in 1958 by the Junior Service League of Longview. Since 1998, it has been on Tyler Street in downtown Longview.\n\nThe LMFA's permanent collection consists of over 700 works of art and its primary focus is [[contemporary art|contemporary]] [[Art of Texas|art from Texas]], [[Art of Arkansas|Arkansas]], [[Art of Colorado|Colorado]], [[Art of Louisiana|Louisiana]], [[Art of New Mexico|New Mexico]], and [[Art of Oklahoma|Oklahoma]]. The museum also hosts both traveling and temporary exhibitions while also offering a variety of [[visual arts education|art education]] classes.\n\n== History ==\nThe LMFA was established in 1958 by the Junior Service League of Longview. In 1959, it hosted its first annual Invitational Exhibit, with [[Dallas Museum of Art]] director [[Jerry Bywaters]] serving as both the consultant and the juror for the exhibit. During its early years, the LMFA was operated by the staff of the [[Nicholson Memorial Library]]. In 1970, the Junior Service League's art collection was placed at the LMFA on permanent loan and it was granted a museum charter by the State of Texas.<ref name=\"History\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.lmfa.org/history/|title=History|publisher=Longview Museum of Fine Arts|url-status=live|access-date=March 8, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSince its foundation in 1958, the LMFA has been physically located at five different sites.<ref name=\"History\" /> Jane Akins, one of the women involved with the museum at its inception, noted that the Junior Service League members would transport paintings from site to site themselves in their personal [[station wagon]]s.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Ferguson|first=Jo Lee|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46360078/exhibit-marks-longview-museums-60th/|title=Exhibit marks Longview museum's 60th birthday|date=July 1, 2018|work=[[Longview News-Journal]]|access-date=March 8, 2020|url-status=live|via=[[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}}}}</ref> On January 17, 1998, the LMFA's current location on Tyler Street in downtown Longview opened with a workshop and lectures by photographers [[Ruth Bernhard]] and [[Michael Kenna (photographer)|Michael Kenna]],<ref name=\"History\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46359598/photographers-to-give-lecture-series/|title=Photographers to give lecture series|date=February 13, 1998|work=Longview News-Journal|access-date=March 8, 2020|url-status=live|via=Newspapers.com {{open access}}}}</ref> after the building had been renovated the previous year.<ref name=\"History\" />\n\nIn 2005, the LMFA opened its Judge J.
