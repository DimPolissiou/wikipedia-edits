The son of a New York stockbroker, he initially worked in his father's firm but was more interested in theater. He landed jobs as an extra in [[short films]] produced by [[Paramount Pictures]] in its Long Island studio, and also performed with several stock theater companies, culminating with playing the male lead in ''[[Sweet Adeline (musical)|Sweet Adeline]]'' on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. This performance attracted the attention of film studio executives, and in 1931, [[Fox Film]] signed him to a Hollywood contract. \n\nHis screen debut in the 1931 film ''[[Bad Girl (1931 film)|Bad Girl]]'' made him an overnight box-office star and he was cast as the lead in a succession of romantic drama and comedy films. In 1934, he co-starred with [[Shirley Temple]] in her first three films. In 1935, at the height of his popularity, he broke his studio contract two years before it expired and became a free agent. With musicals on the wane in the late 1930s, he was cast in a series of [[B movie]]s and began struggling with alcoholism in his personal life. In 1945, having not worked in film for five years, he was selected by director [[Elia Kazan]] for the role of Johnny Nolan, the dreamy alcoholic father in ''[[A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (1945 film)|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn]]'' (1945), which earned him the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. \n\nThe Oscar did not advance his film career, however, and while he still found roles in Broadway productions, in 1949 he became a [[character actor]] on television. He had a regular role in the hit sitcom ''[[It's a Great Life (TV series)|It's a Great Life]]''  from 1954 to 1956, and guest-starred in dozens of episodes of popular television series from the 1950s through mid-1960s. In 1960, his contributions to film and television were recognized with two stars on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].\n\n==Early life==\nJames Howard Dunn was born on November 2, 1901, in [[Manhattan]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:2WWP-YDZ|title=New York, New York City Births, 1846\u20131909|publisher=[[FamilySearch]]|year=2020|accessdate=April 15, 2020}}</ref> His parents, Ralph H.

The son of a New York stockbroker, he initially worked in his father's firm but was more interested in theater. He landed jobs as an extra in [[short films]] produced by [[Paramount Pictures]] in its Long Island studio, and also performed with several stock theater companies, culminating with playing the male lead in ''[[Sweet Adeline (musical)|Sweet Adeline]]'' on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. This performance attracted the attention of film studio executives, and in 1931, [[Fox Film]] signed him to a Hollywood contract. \n\nHis screen debut in the 1931 film ''[[Bad Girl (1931 film)|Bad Girl]]'' made him an overnight box-office star and he was cast as the lead in a succession of romantic drama and comedy films. In 1934, he co-starred with [[Shirley Temple]] in her first three films. In 1935, at the height of his popularity, he broke his studio contract two years before it expired and became a free agent. With musicals on the wane in the late 1930s, he was cast in a series of [[B movie]]s and began struggling with alcoholism in his personal life. In 1945, having not worked in film for five years, he was selected by director [[Elia Kazan]] for the role of Johnny Nolan, the dreamy alcoholic father in ''[[A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (1945 film)|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn]]'' (1945), which earned him the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. \n\nThe Oscar did not advance his film career, however, and while he still found roles in Broadway productions, in 1949 he became a [[character actor]] on television. He had a regular role in the hit sitcom ''[[It's a Great Life (TV series)|It's a Great Life]]''  from 1954 to 1956, and guest-starred in dozens of episodes of popular television series from the 1950s through mid-1960s. In 1960, his contributions to film and television were recognized with two stars on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].\n\n==Early life==\nJames Howard Dunn was born on November 2, 1901, in [[Manhattan]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:2WWP-YDZ|title=New York, New York City Births, 1846\u20131909|publisher=[[FamilySearch]]|year=2020|accessdate=April 15, 2020}}</ref> His parents, Ralph H.

{"title_page": "Damsel of Cyprus", "text_new": "The '''Damsel of Cyprus''' (born c. 1177), possibly named '''Beatrice''' or '''Maria''',{{sfn|Parks|2010|pp=286\u2013289}} was the daughter of [[Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus|Isaac Komnenos]], emperor of [[Byzantine Cyprus|Cyprus]], and an [[Kingdom of Cilicia|Armenian]] princess. She was her father's sole heiress. Her given name is not known with certainty and she is known by convention as the \"Damsel of Cyprus\".\n\nShe was a hostage in the [[Principality of Antioch]] from 1182 until at least 1184. She was captured in 1191 during a brief war between her father and King [[Richard I of England]]. She remained an English prisoner, although treated well, until 1194. During her captivity she travelled throughout the Holy Land, Italy and France. After her release, she remained in France. In 1199 or 1200, she married Count [[Raymond VI of Toulouse]], becoming his fourth wife. They divorced by late 1202 or early 1203, when she married [[Thierry of Flanders (flourished 1197\u20131207)|Thierry of Flanders]], who attempted to claim Cyprus on her behalf. After this failed venture, the couple went to Armenia. Her fate thereafter is unknown.\n\n==Name==\nThe Damsel of Cyprus is specified in contemporary chronicles and documents as \"Isaac's daughter\" (''filia Isaaci''){{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|p=157}} or the \"daughter of the emperor [of Cyprus]\" (''filia imperatoris [Cypri]'',{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|p=158}} ''fille de l'Empereor de Chypre'').{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|p=171}} The chronicles that record her second marriage do not name her husband, either, although his identity can be deduced from the information given.{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|pp=169\u2013170}}\n\nWipertus Rudt de Collenberg suggests that Isaac's daughter may be the ''domicella'' (damsel) Beatrice who is listed first among the female beneficiaries of the will of [[Joan of England, Queen of Sicily|Joan of England]], queen of Sicily and third wife of Raymond of Toulouse, in 1199. She received the large sum of 200 [[Mark (currency)|marks]], while the other ladies received 140 marks (Alice), 100 (Helysabeth), 60 (Philippa) and 15 (Malekakxa). She and Alice also inherited two coffers at Verdun and their contents. The title ''domicella'' (diminutive of lady) implies an unmarried girl of noble birth. The name Beatrice would have been appropriate for Isaac's daughter, since both of her maternal great-grandparents bore the name, [[Beatrice of Saone]] and the daughter of Count [[Hugh I, Count of Rethel|Hugh of Rethel]], as well as her great-great-grandmother, the daughter of [[Constantine I, Prince of Armenia|Constantine I of Armenia]].{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|pp=174\u2013175}}\n\nGeorge Jeffery calls her Maria, without explanation. Annette Parks uses Beatrice, provisionally.{{sfn|Parks|2010|pp=286\u2013289}}\n\n==Childhood==\nThe Damsel was born probably in 1177 or 1178. She had a brother, name also unknown. Her parents were probably married in 1175 or 1176.{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|loc=Tableaux g\u00e9n\u00e9alogiques I and II}} Her father, who was born between 1155 and 1160, had recently been appointed governor of [[Cilicia]] (between 1173 and 1175). Her mother, whose name is also unknown, was the daughter of Prince [[Thoros II of Armenia]] and Isabella, daughter of Count [[Joscelin II of Edessa]]. The Damsel was thus related to the ruling families of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]] and Armenia as well as one of the leading families of crusader [[Outremer]].{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|p=130}}\n\nAfter fighting broke out between Byzantium and Armenia, Isaac was captured. This happened perhaps as early as 1176,{{sfn|Parks|2010|pp=286\u2013289}} certainly by 1180.{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|p=131}} In 1182, he was handed over to Prince [[Bohemond III of Antioch]] in a prisoner exchange. He gave his children as hostages to Bohemond in order to obtain his release to raise his ransom. When the final payment of 30,000 [[bezant]]s was stolen by pirates, he refused to re-raise it and the Damsel and her brother thus remained hostages at the court of the prince of Antioch for another two years, when they were released for reasons of state.{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|pp=133\u2013134}} This was probably around 1184,{{sfn|Parks|2010|pp=286\u2013289}} but [[Roger of Howden]] places it around the time of the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|fall of Jerusalem]] in 1187.{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|pp=133\u2013134}}\n\nThe death of her brother between 1187 and 1191, left the Damsel the sole heir of her father. According to [[Benedict of Peterborough]], Isaac killed his wife and then his son, but this is extremely unlikely.{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|p=135}} His first wife had probably died by 1184 or else opted to remain in her homeland, in which case he would have obtained a divorce. By 1191, he had remarried to an illegitimate daughter of King [[William I of Sicily]].{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|p=145}}\n\n==English captivity==\nBetween 1 and 22 May 1191, Isaac Komnenos was involved in a conflict with the English contingent of the [[Third Crusade]]. He threatened [[Berengaria of Navarre|Berengaria]], the fianc\u00e9e of King [[Richard I of England]], and Richard promptly landed troops and took [[Limassol]] while Isaac retreated after some skirmishes. On 16 May, the two met and Richard demanded that Isaac pay an indemnity, put a mixed force of cavalry and infantry at his disposal and hand over his daughter and his new wife as hostages. In return, Richard would [[enfeoff]] him with Cyprus. Isaac refused these terms and retreated north. On 21 May, Richard attacked the [[Kyrenia Castle|castle of Kyrenia]], having learned that Isaac's daughter was there. The Damsel, who was only about fourteen years old, came out of the castle, fell at Richard's feet \"out of fear\" and surrendered both herself and the fortress. Richard took her hand and helped her to her feet.{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|p=148\u2013151}}\n\nAccording to the ''[[Itinerarium Regis Ricardi|Itinerarium regis Ricardi]]'', on learning of his daughter's capture Isaac despaired \"because he loved her dearly\".{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|p=148\u2013151}} Roger of Howden is even stronger, writing \"he loved [her] more than any other creature\".{{sfn|Parks|2010|pp=286\u2013289}} He surrendered on 22 May.{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|p=148\u2013151}} There is no basis for the claim by [[H. W. C. Davis]] that Richard threatened to kill his captive to induce Isaac's surrender.{{sfn|Parks|2010|pp=286\u2013289}} On 1 June, Richard quit Cyprus, taking his prisoners with him to [[Akko|Acre]].{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|p=148\u2013151}}\n\nThe ''Itinerarium'' describes her as a \"young little thing\" (''juvenculam parvulam'') at the time of her capture. The ''[[Chronica anonymi Laudunensis canonici]]'' also describes her as handsome (''speciosa''). [[Ralph de Diceto]] even thought it necessary to condemn those who accused Richard of an attraction to his captive. According to the ''Itinerarium'', Richard had her put \"in custody, lest she be carried off\" (''in custodiam ne forte raperetur''), which implies physical confinement.{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|p=156}} The ''[[Ernoul|Chronique d'Ernoul]]'' and the ''[[Eracles|Histoire d'Eracles]]'' claim that she was imprisoned in [[Margat]] with her father, but Ralph says that she was \"retained in honorable custody in the royal chamber with the two queens\"<!-- (''cum duabus reginis in thalamo regis honorifice custodiam retinuit'')-->, Richard's queen, Berengaria, and his sister Joan, dowager queen of Sicily.{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|p=157}} The poet [[Ambroise]], commenting on her capture, also says she was sent to the queen not for safekeeping but for her education:\n<poem>\n:And his young daughter a most fair\n:And lovely maid of beauty rare\n:Had sent her to the queen that she\n:Might well be taught and fittingly.{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|p=156}}\n</poem>\nThe chronicles of the Third Crusade note the continued presence of \"Isaac's daughter\" with the two queens. The three spent Christmas 1191 at [[Toron]] and afterwards visited [[Jerusalem]]. They embarked to return to Europe on 29 September 1192. They went first to Sicily, where the second wife of Isaac had also returned. There they learned that Richard had been imprisoned by Duke [[Leopold V, Duke of Austria|Leopold V of Austria]]. Escorted by [[Stephen de Turnham]], they went on to Rome, where they were present on 9 April 1193.{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|p=157}}\n\nRoger of Howden records that Pope [[Celestine III]] honorably received the emperor of Cyprus's daughter. They remained in Rome until June. They left under the escort of Cardnial [[Melior (cardinal)|Melior]] and went by way of [[Pisa]] and [[Genoa]] to [[Marseille]], where they were met by King [[Alfonso II of Aragon]], whose brother [[Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Provence|Raymond Berengar]] was the count of Provence. Alfonso escorted them through Provence to the [[County of Toulouse]], where they were escorted by Raymond of Saint-Gilles, the future Count [[Raymond VI of Toulouse|Raymond VI]], who would later marry both Joan and the Damsel. They arrived in [[Poitiers]] in Richard's [[Duchy of Aquitaine]] towards the end of 1193.{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|p=158}}\n\n==Release==\nOn 14 February 1193 at [[W\u00fcrzburg]], Leopold of Austria signed a treaty with [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor]]. By its terms, Leopold would hand Richard over to Henry, who would hold him prisoner until Isaac and his daughter were released. Leopold and Isaac were second cousins. On 28 March, Richard was handed over and the treaty came into force. On 26 June, Richard signed an agreement with Henry that incorporated the treaty of W\u00fcrzburg in its entirety. The Damsel was to be handed over to Leopold as guardian at the same time as Richard's niece, [[Eleanor, Fair Maid of Brittany|Eleanor of Brittany]], who was betrothed to Leopold's son [[Frederick I, Duke of Austria (Babenberg)|Frederick]]. The negotiations also envisioned the future marriage of the Damsel to Frederick's younger brother, [[Leopold VI, Duke of Austria|Leopold VI]], her third cousin. Richard was released on 2 February 1194, presumably a date corresponding in some way to the liberation of Isaac.{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|pp=159\u2013162}}\n\nIn 1194, the Damsel was joined by Eleanor of Brittany at the court of Berengaria and Joan, which travelled between [[Chinon]] and [[Rouen]]. An entry in the [[pipe rolls]] of the [[Exchequer of Normandy]] for 11 September 1194 records a payment of 168 pounds and 12 shillings to \"the daughter of the Count of Brittany and the daughter of the Emperor of Cyprus and their [joint] household\". In the autumn of 1194, Duke Leopold complained to Richard that the girls had not yet been sent to him.{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|p=163}}\n\nIn December 1194, the Damsel of Cyprus and Eleanor of Brittany departed for [[Vienna]] in the company of [[Baldwin of B\u00e9thune]]. When the latter learned of the death of Leopold on 31 December, he turned the party around on his own initiative and returned to Normandy. The duke's sons had no interest in pursuing the marriages their father had envisioned for them and they died with him. The party arrived back in Normandy in the spring of 1196.

She died on 24 September 1199, having spent the last part of her marriage in northern France. The ''Histoire d'Eracles'' seems to suppose that the Damsel remained a prisoner down to 1199, which perception may be owed to her continued residence with Joan. After the death of Joan, she became Raymond's fourth wife, probably in 1199 or 1200. The editorial remark in the ''[[Recueil des historiens des croisades]]'' that she was a mere concubine is without foundation. The marriage is recorded in the ''Eracles'' and by [[Pierre de Vaux-Cernay]], who mistakenly dates it to 1193\u20131196.{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|pp=166\u2013167}} The marriage was over by 1203 (probably by October 1202<!--when Raymond was in the Holy Land?-->) and Raymond married a fifth time in January 1204.

The fleet did not take part in the [[Sack of Constantinople|attack on Constantinople]] but sailed directly to the Holy Land. It stopped in Cyprus, where Thierry with the support of his men demanded the island in the name of his wife. Rebuffed by the actual king of Cyprus, [[Aimery of Cyprus|Aimery]], the majority of the crusaders, including Thierry and his wife, went on to Armenia. This is the last that is heard of the Damsel.

She was her father's sole heiress. Her given name is not known with certainty and she is known by convention as the \"Damsel of Cyprus\".\n\nShe was a hostage in the [[Principality of Antioch]] from 1182 until at least 1184. She was captured in 1191 during a brief war between her father and King [[Richard I of England]]. She remained an English prisoner, although treated well, until 1194. During her captivity she travelled throughout the Holy Land, Italy and France. After her release, she remained in France. In 1199 or 1200, she married Count [[Raymond VI of Toulouse]], becoming his fourth wife. They divorced by late 1202 or early 1203, when she married [[Thierry of Flanders (flourished 1197\u20131207)|Thierry of Flanders]], who attempted to claim Cyprus on her behalf. After this failed venture, the couple went to Armenia. Her fate thereafter is unknown.\n\n==Name==\nThe Damsel of Cyprus is specified in contemporary chronicles and documents as \"Isaac's daughter\" (''filia Isaaci''){{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|p=157}} or the \"daughter of the emperor [of Cyprus]\" (''filia imperatoris [Cypri]'',{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|p=158}} ''fille de l'Empereor de Chypre'').{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|p=171}} The chronicles that record her second marriage do not name her husband, either, although his identity can be deduced from the information given.{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|pp=169\u2013170}}\n\nWipertus Rudt de Collenberg suggests that Isaac's daughter may be the ''domicella'' (damsel) Beatrice who is listed first among the female beneficiaries of the will of [[Joan of England, Queen of Sicily|Joan of England]], queen of Sicily and third wife of Raymond of Toulouse, in 1199. She received the large sum of 200 [[Mark (currency)|marks]], while the other ladies received 140 marks (Alice), 100 (Helysabeth), 60 (Philippa) and 15 (Malekakxa). She and Alice also inherited two coffers at Verdun and their contents. The title ''domicella'' (diminutive of lady) implies an unmarried girl of noble birth. The name Beatrice would have been appropriate for Isaac's daughter, since both of her maternal great-grandparents bore the name, [[Beatrice of Saone]] and the daughter of Count [[Hugh I, Count of Rethel|Hugh of Rethel]], as well as her great-great-grandmother, the daughter of [[Constantine I, Prince of Armenia|Constantine I of Armenia]].{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|pp=174\u2013175}}\n\nGeorge Jeffery calls her Maria, without explanation. Annette Parks uses Beatrice, provisionally.{{sfn|Parks|2010|pp=286\u2013289}}\n\n==Childhood==\nThe Damsel was born probably in 1177 or 1178. She had a brother, name also unknown. Her parents were probably married in 1175 or 1176.{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|loc=Tableaux g\u00e9n\u00e9alogiques I and II}} Her father, who was born between 1155 and 1160, had recently been appointed governor of [[Cilicia]] (between 1173 and 1175). Her mother, whose name is also unknown, was the daughter of Prince [[Thoros II of Armenia]] and Isabella, daughter of Count [[Joscelin II of Edessa]]. The Damsel was thus related to the ruling families of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]] and Armenia as well as one of the leading families of crusader [[Outremer]].{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|p=130}}\n\nAfter fighting broke out between Byzantium and Armenia, Isaac was captured. This happened perhaps as early as 1176,{{sfn|Parks|2010|pp=286\u2013289}} certainly by 1180.{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|p=131}} In 1182, he was handed over to Prince [[Bohemond III of Antioch]] in a prisoner exchange. He gave his children as hostages to Bohemond in order to obtain his release to raise his ransom. When the final payment of 30,000 [[bezant]]s was stolen by pirates, he refused to re-raise it and the Damsel and her brother thus remained hostages at the court of the prince of Antioch for another two years, when they were released for reasons of state.{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|pp=133\u2013134}} This was probably around 1184,{{sfn|Parks|2010|pp=286\u2013289}} but [[Roger of Howden]] places it around the time of the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|fall of Jerusalem]] in 1187.{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|pp=133\u2013134}}\n\nThe death of her brother between 1187 and 1191, left the Damsel the sole heir of her father. According to [[Benedict of Peterborough]], Isaac killed his wife and then his son, but this is extremely unlikely.{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|p=135}} His first wife had probably died by 1184 or else opted to remain in her homeland, in which case he would have obtained a divorce. By 1191, he had remarried to an illegitimate daughter of King [[William I of Sicily]].{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|p=145}}\n\n==English captivity==\nBetween 1 and 22 May 1191, Isaac Komnenos was involved in a conflict with the English contingent of the [[Third Crusade]]. He threatened [[Berengaria of Navarre|Berengaria]], the fianc\u00e9e of King [[Richard I of England]], and Richard promptly landed troops and took [[Limassol]] while Isaac retreated after some skirmishes. On 16 May, the two met and Richard demanded that Isaac pay an indemnity, put a mixed force of cavalry and infantry at his disposal and hand over his daughter and his new wife as hostages. In return, Richard would [[enfeoff]] him with Cyprus. Isaac refused these terms and retreated north. On 21 May, Richard attacked the [[Kyrenia Castle|castle of Kyrenia]], having learned that Isaac's daughter was there. The Damsel, who was only about fourteen years old, came out of the castle, fell at Richard's feet \"out of fear\" and surrendered both herself and the fortress. Richard took her hand and helped her to her feet.{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|p=148\u2013151}}\n\nAccording to the ''[[Itinerarium Regis Ricardi|Itinerarium regis Ricardi]]'', on learning of his daughter's capture Isaac despaired \"because he loved her dearly\".{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|p=148\u2013151}} Roger of Howden is even stronger, writing \"he loved [her] more than any other creature\".{{sfn|Parks|2010|pp=286\u2013289}} He surrendered on 22 May.{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|p=148\u2013151}} There is no basis for the claim by [[H. W. C. Davis]] that Richard threatened to kill his captive to induce Isaac's surrender.{{sfn|Parks|2010|pp=286\u2013289}} On 1 June, Richard quit Cyprus, taking his prisoners with him to [[Akko|Acre]].{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|p=148\u2013151}}\n\nThe ''Itinerarium'' describes her as a \"young little thing\" (''juvenculam parvulam'') at the time of her capture. The ''[[Chronica anonymi Laudunensis canonici]]'' also describes her as handsome (''speciosa''). [[Ralph de Diceto]] even thought it necessary to condemn those who accused Richard of an attraction to his captive. According to the ''Itinerarium'', Richard had her put \"in custody, lest she be carried off\" (''in custodiam ne forte raperetur''), which implies physical confinement.{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|p=156}} The ''[[Ernoul|Chronique d'Ernoul]]'' and the ''[[Eracles|Histoire d'Eracles]]'' claim that she was imprisoned in [[Margat]] with her father, but Ralph says that she was \"retained in honorable custody in the royal chamber with the two queens\"<!-- (''cum duabus reginis in thalamo regis honorifice custodiam retinuit'')-->, Richard's queen, Berengaria, and his sister Joan, dowager queen of Sicily.{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|p=157}} The poet [[Ambroise]], commenting on her capture, also says she was sent to the queen not for safekeeping but for her education:\n<poem>\n:And his young daughter a most fair\n:And lovely maid of beauty rare\n:Had sent her to the queen that she\n:Might well be taught and fittingly.{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|p=156}}\n</poem>\nThe chronicles of the Third Crusade note the continued presence of \"Isaac's daughter\" with the two queens. The three spent Christmas 1191 at [[Toron]] and afterwards visited [[Jerusalem]]. They embarked to return to Europe on 29 September 1192. They went first to Sicily, where the second wife of Isaac had also returned. There they learned that Richard had been imprisoned by Duke [[Leopold V, Duke of Austria|Leopold V of Austria]]. Escorted by [[Stephen de Turnham]], they went on to Rome, where they were present on 9 April 1193.{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|p=157}}\n\nRoger of Howden records that Pope [[Celestine III]] honorably received the emperor of Cyprus's daughter. They remained in Rome until June. They left under the escort of Cardnial [[Melior (cardinal)|Melior]] and went by way of [[Pisa]] and [[Genoa]] to [[Marseille]], where they were met by King [[Alfonso II of Aragon]], whose brother [[Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Provence|Raymond Berengar]] was the count of Provence. Alfonso escorted them through Provence to the [[County of Toulouse]], where they were escorted by Raymond of Saint-Gilles, the future Count [[Raymond VI of Toulouse|Raymond VI]], who would later marry both Joan and the Damsel. They arrived in [[Poitiers]] in Richard's [[Duchy of Aquitaine]] towards the end of 1193.{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|p=158}}\n\n==Release==\nOn 14 February 1193 at [[W\u00fcrzburg]], Leopold of Austria signed a treaty with [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor]]. By its terms, Leopold would hand Richard over to Henry, who would hold him prisoner until Isaac and his daughter were released. Leopold and Isaac were second cousins. On 28 March, Richard was handed over and the treaty came into force. On 26 June, Richard signed an agreement with Henry that incorporated the treaty of W\u00fcrzburg in its entirety. The Damsel was to be handed over to Leopold as guardian at the same time as Richard's niece, [[Eleanor, Fair Maid of Brittany|Eleanor of Brittany]], who was betrothed to Leopold's son [[Frederick I, Duke of Austria (Babenberg)|Frederick]]. The negotiations also envisioned the future marriage of the Damsel to Frederick's younger brother, [[Leopold VI, Duke of Austria|Leopold VI]], her third cousin. Richard was released on 2 February 1194, presumably a date corresponding in some way to the liberation of Isaac.{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|pp=159\u2013162}}\n\nIn 1194, the Damsel was joined by Eleanor of Brittany at the court of Berengaria and Joan, which travelled between [[Chinon]] and [[Rouen]]. An entry in the [[pipe rolls]] of the [[Exchequer of Normandy]] for 11 September 1194 records a payment of 168 pounds and 12 shillings to \"the daughter of the Count of Brittany and the daughter of the Emperor of Cyprus and their [joint] household\". In the autumn of 1194, Duke Leopold complained to Richard that the girls had not yet been sent to him.{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|p=163}}\n\nIn December 1194, the Damsel of Cyprus and Eleanor of Brittany departed for [[Vienna]] in the company of [[Baldwin of B\u00e9thune]]. When the latter learned of the death of Leopold on 31 December, he turned the party around on his own initiative and returned to Normandy. The duke's sons had no interest in pursuing the marriages their father had envisioned for them and they died with him. The party arrived back in Normandy in the spring of 1196. This coincided with the death of her father in late 1195 or early 1196{{sfn|Rudt de Collenberg|1968|pp=163\u2013164}}\n\n==Marriages==\nNothing is known of the Damsel's movements for the next five years.<!-- It is possible but unlikely that she joined her relatives in [[Montpellier]].

{"title_page": "Epicureanism", "text_new": "{{Redirect|Epicurean}}\n[[Image:Epikouros BM 1843.jpg|thumb|Roman [[Epicurus]] bust]]\n'''Epicureanism''' is a system of [[philosophy]] founded around 307 BC based upon the teachings of the [[Hellenistic philosophy|ancient Greek philosopher]] [[Epicurus]]. Epicureanism was originally a challenge to [[Platonism]]. Later its main opponent became [[Stoicism]]. \n\nSome writings by Epicurus have survived. Some scholars consider the epic poem ''[[De rerum natura]]'' (Latin for ''On the Nature of Things'') by [[Lucretius]] to present in one unified work the core arguments and theories of Epicureanism. Many of the scrolls unearthed at the [[Villa of the Papyri]] at [[Herculaneum]] are Epicurean texts. At least some are thought to have belonged to the Epicurean philosopher [[Philodemus]].\n\nEpicurus was an [[atomism|atomic]] [[materialism|materialist]], following in the steps of [[Democritus]]. His materialism led him to a [[Religious skepticism|general attack on superstition and divine intervention]]. Following the [[Cyrenaics|Cyrenaic philosopher]]  [[Aristippus]], Epicurus believed that the greatest good was to seek modest, sustainable pleasure in the form of a state of [[ataraxia]] (tranquility and freedom from fear) and [[aponia]] (the absence of bodily pain) through knowledge of the workings of the world and limiting desires. The combination of these two states constitutes happiness in its highest form. Correspondingly, Epicurus and his followers shunned politics because it could lead to frustrations and ambitions which can directly conflict with the Epicurean pursuit for peace of mind and virtues.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism : a very short introduction|last=1951-|first=Wilson, Catherine|isbn=9780199688326|edition=  First|location=Oxford, United Kingdom|oclc=917374685|year = 2015}}</ref> \n\nAlthough Epicureanism is a form of [[hedonism]] insofar as it declares pleasure to be its sole intrinsic goal, the concept that the absence of pain and fear constitutes the greatest pleasure, and its advocacy of a simple life, make it very different from \"hedonism\" as [[colloquially]] understood. \n\nEpicureanism flourished in the Late Hellenistic era and during the Roman era, and many Epicurean communities were established, such as those in [[Antioch]]ia, [[Alexandria]], [[Rhodes]], and [[Herculaneum]]. By the late 3rd Century CE Epicureanism all but died out, being opposed by other philosophies (mainly [[Neoplatonism]]) that were now in the ascendant. Interest in Epicureanism was resurrected in the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and continues in the modern era.\n\n==History==\nIn [[Mytilene]], the capital of the island [[Lesbos]], and then in [[Lampsacus]], [[Epicurus]] taught and gained followers. In [[Athens]], Epicurus bought a property for his school called \"Garden\", later the name of Epicurus' school.<ref name=\"Stanford\">{{cite encyclopedia|author=David Konstan|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epicurus/|title=Epicurus|encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}</ref> Its members included [[Hermarchus]], [[Idomeneus of Lampsacus|Idomeneus]], [[Colotes]], [[Polyaenus of Lampsacus|Polyaenus]], and [[Metrodorus of Lampsacus (the younger)|Metrodorus]]. Epicurus emphasized friendship as an important ingredient of happiness, and the school seems to have been a moderately ascetic community which rejected the political limelight of Athenian philosophy. They were fairly [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] by Athenian standards, including women and slaves. Some members were also [[Vegetarianism|vegetarians]] as, from slender evidence, Epicurus did not eat meat, although no prohibition against eating meat was made.<ref>[http://advocacy.britannica.com/blog/advocacy/2010/08/the-hidden-history-of-greco-roman-vegetarianism/ The Hidden History of Greco-Roman Vegetarianism]</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Dombrowski|first=Daniel|authorlink=Daniel Dombrowski|title=The Philosophy of Vegetarianism|url=https://books.googledam.com/books?id=nSLoTGecabsC&pg=PA81|year=1984|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|isbn=978-0-87023-431-6|page=81}}</ref>\n\nThe school's popularity grew and it became, along with [[Stoicism]], [[Platonism]], [[Peripatetic school|Peripateticism]], and [[Pyrrhonism]], one of the dominant schools of [[Hellenistic philosophy]], lasting strongly through the later [[Roman Empire]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=MacGillivray|first1=Erlend D|title=The Popularity of Epicureanism in Late-Republic Roman Society.

Another ancient source is [[Diogenes of Oenoanda]], who composed a large inscription at [[Oenoanda]] in [[Lycia]].\n\nDeciphered carbonized [[scroll]]s obtained from the library at the [[Villa of the Papyri]] in [[Herculaneum]] contain a large number of works by [[Philodemus]], a late Hellenistic Epicurean, and Epicurus himself, attesting to the school's enduring popularity. [[Diogenes La\u00ebrtius|Diogenes]] reports slanderous stories, circulated by Epicurus' opponents.<ref name=\"Stanford\" /> With growing dominance of [[Neoplatonism]] and [[Peripateticism]], and later, [[Christianity]], Epicureanism declined.

Attacks by Christians continued, most forcefully by the [[Cambridge Platonists]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nIn the [[early modern period]], scientists adopted [[atomism|atomist]] theories, while [[materialism|materialist]] philosophers embraced Epicurus' hedonist ethics and restated his objections to natural [[teleology]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n==Philosophy==\n{{Hedonism}}Epicureanism argued that [[pleasure]] was the chief good in life.<ref name=\":6\" /> Hence, Epicurus advocated living in such a way as to derive the greatest amount of pleasure possible during one's lifetime, yet doing so moderately in order to avoid the suffering incurred by overindulgence in such pleasure.<ref name=\":6\" /> Emphasis was placed on pleasures of the mind rather than on physical pleasures.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism|last=O'Keefe|first=Tim|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=107\u2013115}}</ref> Unnecessary and, especially, artificially produced desires were to be suppressed.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism|last=O'Keefe|first=Tim|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=125\u2013127}}</ref> Since the political life could give rise to desires that could disturb virtue and one's peace of mind, such as a lust for power or a desire for fame, participation in politics was discouraged.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism: A Very Brief Introduction|last=Wilson|first=Catherine|publisher=Oxford University|year=2015|isbn=|location=United States of America|pages=84\u201385}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism|last=O'Keefe|first=Tim|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|page=145}}</ref> Further, Epicurus sought to eliminate the fear of the gods and of death, seeing those two fears as chief causes of strife in life.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism|last=O'Keefe|first=Tim|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=155\u2013171}}</ref> Epicurus actively recommended against passionate love, and believed it best to avoid marriage altogether.

In fact, Epicurus referred to life as a \"bitter gift\".\n\n{{quote|When we say . . . that pleasure is the end and aim, we do not mean the pleasures of the prodigal or the pleasures of sensuality, as we are understood to do by some through ignorance, prejudice or wilful misrepresentation.

It is not by an unbroken succession of drinking bouts and of revelry, not by sexual lust, nor the enjoyment of fish and other delicacies of a luxurious table, which produce a pleasant life; it is sober reasoning, searching out the grounds of every choice and avoidance, and banishing those beliefs through which the greatest tumults take possession of the soul.|Epicurus|''\"Letter to Menoeceus\"''<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Epicurus, \"Letter to Menoeceus\", contained in Diogenes Laertius, ''Lives of Eminent Philosophers'', Book X</ref>}}\n\nEpicureanism rejects immortality.

[[David Hume]] paraphrased this passage in his ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]'': \"EPICURUS's old questions are yet unanswered.

Other adherents to the teachings of Epicurus included the poet [[Horace]], whose famous statement ''Carpe Diem'' (\"Seize the Day\") illustrates the philosophy, as well as [[Lucretius]], who wrote the poem ''De rerum natura'' about the tenets of the philosophy. The poet [[Virgil]] was another prominent Epicurean (see [[Lucretius]] for further details). The Epicurean philosopher [[Philodemus of Gadara]], until the 18th century only known as a poet of minor importance, rose to prominence as most of his work along with other Epicurean material was discovered in the [[Villa of the Papyri]]. In the second century CE, comedian [[Lucian of Samosata]] and wealthy promoter of philosophy [[Diogenes of Oenoanda]] were prominent Epicureans.\n\n[[Julius Caesar]] leaned considerably toward Epicureanism, which e.g. led to his plea against the death sentence during the trial against [[Catiline]], during the [[Second Catilinarian Conspiracy|Catiline conspiracy]] where he spoke out against the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] [[Cato the Younger|Cato]].<ref>Cf.

And I wish I could subjoin a translation of Gassendi's Syntagma of the doctrines of Epicurus, which, notwithstanding the calumnies of the Stoics and caricatures of Cicero, is the most rational system remaining of the philosophy of the ancients, as frugal of vicious indulgence, and fruitful of virtue as the hyperbolical extravagances of his rival sects.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/writingsofthomas10jeffiala/writingsofthomas10jeffiala_djvu.txt|title=Full text of \"The writings of Thomas Jefferson;\"|website=archive.org|access-date=2016-05-06}}</ref></blockquote>Other modern-day Epicureans were [[Pierre Gassendi|Gassendi]], [[Walter Charleton]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Bernier]], [[Saint-Evremond]], [[Ninon de l'Enclos]], [[Denis Diderot]], [[Frances Wright]] and [[Jeremy Bentham]].\n\n[[Christopher Hitchens]] referred to himself as an Epicurean.<ref>[http://www.townhall.com/TalkRadio/Show.aspx?ContentGuid=dab6495c-e875-4fd1-9fa6-53809a40ef15&RadioShowId=5 Townhall.com::Talk Radio Online::Radio Show<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In France, where perfumer/restaurateur G\u00e9rald Ghislain refers to himself as an Epicurean,<ref>Anon., [https://ideamensch.com/gerald-ghislain ''G\u00e9rald Ghislain \u2013 Creator of The Scent of Departure''].

[[Humanistic Judaism]] as a denomination also claims the Epicurean label.\n\n== Modern usage and misconceptions ==\nIn modern popular usage, an Epicurean is a connoisseur of the arts of life and the refinements of sensual pleasures; ''Epicureanism'' implies a love or knowledgeable enjoyment especially of good food and drink.\n\nBecause Epicureanism posits that pleasure is the ultimate good (''telos''), it has been commonly misunderstood since ancient times as a doctrine that advocates the partaking in fleeting pleasures such as sexual excess and decadent food. This is not the case. Epicurus regarded ''[[ataraxia]]'' (tranquility, freedom from fear) and ''[[aponia]]'' (absence of pain) as the height of happiness. He also considered prudence an important virtue and perceived excess and overindulgence to be contrary to the attainment of ataraxia and aponia.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nEpicurus referred \"the good\", and \"even wisdom and culture\", to the \"pleasure of the stomach\".<ref>Cyril Bailey, Epicurus: The Extant Remains, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1926, p.131</ref>  While twentieth-century commentary has generally sought to diminish this and related quotations, the consistency of the lower-case epicureanism of meals with Epicurean materialism overall has more recently been explained.<ref>Michael Symons, \"Epicurus, the foodies\u2019 philosopher\", pp. 13-30, in Fritz Allhoff and Dave Monroe, eds, Food & Philosophy: Eat, think, and be merry, Malden (MA, USA): Blackwell Publishing, 2007</ref>\nWhile Epicurus sought moderation at meals, he was also not averse to moderation in moderation, that is, to occasional luxury. Called \"The Garden\" for being based in what would have been a kitchen garden, his community also became known for its feasts of the twentieth (of the Greek month).\n\n==Criticism==\n[[Francis Bacon]] wrote an apothegm related to Epicureanism:\n \n<blockquote>There was an Epicurean vaunted, that divers of other sects of philosophers did after turn Epicureans, but there was never any Epicurean that turned to any other sect. Whereupon a philosopher that was of another sect, said; The reason was plain, for that cocks may be made capons, but capons could never be made cocks.<ref>Francis Bacon, Apothegms 280</ref>  </blockquote>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Philosophy}}\n{{Wikipedia books|Epicureanism}}\n* [[Charvaka]], a hedonic Indian school\n* [[Dehellenization]]\n* ''[[Epicurea]]''\n* [[Epicurean paradox]]\n* [[Epikoros]]\n* [[Hedonic treadmill]]\n* [[List of English translations of De rerum natura|List of English translations of ''De rerum natura'']]\n* [[Philosophy of happiness]]\n* [[Separation of church and state]]\n* [[Zeno of Sidon]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Dane R.

Epicureanism was originally a challenge to [[Platonism]]. Later its main opponent became [[Stoicism]]. \n\nSome writings by Epicurus have survived. Some scholars consider the epic poem ''[[De rerum natura]]'' (Latin for ''On the Nature of Things'') by [[Lucretius]] to present in one unified work the core arguments and theories of Epicureanism. Many of the scrolls unearthed at the [[Villa of the Papyri]] at [[Herculaneum]] are Epicurean texts. At least some are thought to have belonged to the Epicurean philosopher [[Philodemus]].\n\nEpicurus was an [[atomism|atomic]] [[materialism|materialist]], following in the steps of [[Democritus]]. His materialism led him to a [[Religious skepticism|general attack on superstition and divine intervention]]. Following the [[Cyrenaics|Cyrenaic philosopher]]  [[Aristippus]], Epicurus believed that the greatest good was to seek modest, sustainable pleasure in the form of a state of [[ataraxia]] (tranquility and freedom from fear) and [[aponia]] (the absence of bodily pain) through knowledge of the workings of the world and limiting desires. The combination of these two states constitutes happiness in its highest form. Correspondingly, Epicurus and his followers shunned politics because it could lead to frustrations and ambitions which can directly conflict with the Epicurean pursuit for peace of mind and virtues.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism : a very short introduction|last=1951-|first=Wilson, Catherine|isbn=9780199688326|edition=  First|location=Oxford, United Kingdom|oclc=917374685|year = 2015}}</ref> \n\nAlthough Epicureanism is a form of [[hedonism]] insofar as it declares pleasure to be its sole intrinsic goal, the concept that the absence of pain and fear constitutes the greatest pleasure, and its advocacy of a simple life, make it very different from \"hedonism\" as [[colloquially]] understood. \n\nEpicureanism flourished in the Late Hellenistic era and during the Roman era, and many Epicurean communities were established, such as those in [[Antioch]]ia, [[Alexandria]], [[Rhodes]], and [[Herculaneum]]. By the late 3rd Century CE Epicureanism all but died out, being opposed by other philosophies (mainly [[Neoplatonism]]) that were now in the ascendant. Interest in Epicureanism was resurrected in the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and continues in the modern era.\n\n==History==\nIn [[Mytilene]], the capital of the island [[Lesbos]], and then in [[Lampsacus]], [[Epicurus]] taught and gained followers. In [[Athens]], Epicurus bought a property for his school called \"Garden\", later the name of Epicurus' school.<ref name=\"Stanford\">{{cite encyclopedia|author=David Konstan|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epicurus/|title=Epicurus|encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}</ref> Its members included [[Hermarchus]], [[Idomeneus of Lampsacus|Idomeneus]], [[Colotes]], [[Polyaenus of Lampsacus|Polyaenus]], and [[Metrodorus of Lampsacus (the younger)|Metrodorus]]. Epicurus emphasized friendship as an important ingredient of happiness, and the school seems to have been a moderately ascetic community which rejected the political limelight of Athenian philosophy. They were fairly [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] by Athenian standards, including women and slaves. Some members were also [[Vegetarianism|vegetarians]] as, from slender evidence, Epicurus did not eat meat, although no prohibition against eating meat was made.<ref>[http://advocacy.britannica.com/blog/advocacy/2010/08/the-hidden-history-of-greco-roman-vegetarianism/ The Hidden History of Greco-Roman Vegetarianism]</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Dombrowski|first=Daniel|authorlink=Daniel Dombrowski|title=The Philosophy of Vegetarianism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nSLoTGecabsC&pg=PA81|year=1984|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|isbn=978-0-87023-431-6|page=81}}</ref>\n\nThe school's popularity grew and it became, along with [[Stoicism]], [[Platonism]], [[Peripatetic school|Peripateticism]], and [[Pyrrhonism]], one of the dominant schools of [[Hellenistic philosophy]], lasting strongly through the later [[Roman Empire]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=MacGillivray|first1=Erlend D|title=The Popularity of Epicureanism in Late-Republic Roman Society.

[[David Hume]] paraphrased this passage in his ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]'': \"EPICURUS's old questions are yet unanswered.

This poetic doctrine was handed down by an anonymous Epicurean who summed up Epicurus' philosophy on happiness in four simple lines:\n\n{{quote|Don't fear god,<br />Don't worry about death;<br />What is good is easy to get, and<br />What is terrible is easy to endure.|[[Philodemus]]|[[Herculaneum]] Papyrus, 1005, 4.9\u201314}}\n\n==Notable Epicureans==\n[[File:Lucretius, De rerum natura.jpg|thumb|''[[De rerum natura]]'' manuscript, copied by an Augustinian friar for Pope [[Sixtus IV]], c. 1483, after the discovery of an early manuscript in 1417 by the humanist and papal secretary [[Poggio Bracciolini]]]]\nOne of the earliest [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] writers espousing Epicureanism was [[Amafinius]]. Other adherents to the teachings of Epicurus included the poet [[Horace]], whose famous statement ''Carpe Diem'' (\"Seize the Day\") illustrates the philosophy, as well as [[Lucretius]], who wrote the poem ''De rerum natura'' about the tenets of the philosophy. The poet [[Virgil]] was another prominent Epicurean (see [[Lucretius]] for further details). The Epicurean philosopher [[Philodemus of Gadara]], until the 18th century only known as a poet of minor importance, rose to prominence as most of his work along with other Epicurean material was discovered in the [[Villa of the Papyri]]. In the second century CE, comedian [[Lucian of Samosata]] and wealthy promoter of philosophy [[Diogenes of Oenoanda]] were prominent Epicureans.\n\n[[Julius Caesar]] leaned considerably toward Epicureanism, which e.g. led to his plea against the death sentence during the trial against [[Catiline]], during the [[Second Catilinarian Conspiracy|Catiline conspiracy]] where he spoke out against the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] [[Cato the Younger|Cato]].<ref>Cf. [[Sallust]], ''The War With Catiline'', Caesar's speech: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Sallust/Bellum_Catilinae*.html#51.20 51.29] & Cato's reply: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Sallust/Bellum_Catilinae*.html#52.13 52.13]).</ref> His father-in-law, [[Lucius_Calpurnius_Piso_Caesoninus_(consul_58_BC)|Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus]] was also an adept of the school.\n\nIn modern times [[Thomas Jefferson]] referred to himself as an Epicurean:<blockquote>If I had time I would add to my little book the Greek, Latin and French texts, in columns side by side. And I wish I could subjoin a translation of Gassendi's Syntagma of the doctrines of Epicurus, which, notwithstanding the calumnies of the Stoics and caricatures of Cicero, is the most rational system remaining of the philosophy of the ancients, as frugal of vicious indulgence, and fruitful of virtue as the hyperbolical extravagances of his rival sects.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/writingsofthomas10jeffiala/writingsofthomas10jeffiala_djvu.txt|title=Full text of \"The writings of Thomas Jefferson;\"|website=archive.org|access-date=2016-05-06}}</ref></blockquote>Other modern-day Epicureans were [[Pierre Gassendi|Gassendi]], [[Walter Charleton]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Bernier]], [[Saint-Evremond]], [[Ninon de l'Enclos]], [[Denis Diderot]], [[Frances Wright]] and [[Jeremy Bentham]].\n\n[[Christopher Hitchens]] referred to himself as an Epicurean.<ref>[http://www.townhall.com/TalkRadio/Show.aspx?ContentGuid=dab6495c-e875-4fd1-9fa6-53809a40ef15&RadioShowId=5 Townhall.com::Talk Radio Online::Radio Show<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In France, where perfumer/restaurateur G\u00e9rald Ghislain refers to himself as an Epicurean,<ref>Anon., [https://ideamensch.com/gerald-ghislain ''G\u00e9rald Ghislain \u2013 Creator of The Scent of Departure''].

[[Humanistic Judaism]] as a denomination also claims the Epicurean label.\n\n== Modern usage and misconceptions ==\nIn modern popular usage, an Epicurean is a connoisseur of the arts of life and the refinements of sensual pleasures; ''Epicureanism'' implies a love or knowledgeable enjoyment especially of good food and drink.\n\nBecause Epicureanism posits that pleasure is the ultimate good (''telos''), it has been commonly misunderstood since ancient times as a doctrine that advocates the partaking in fleeting pleasures such as sexual excess and decadent food. This is not the case. Epicurus regarded ''[[ataraxia]]'' (tranquility, freedom from fear) and ''[[aponia]]'' (absence of pain) as the height of happiness. He also considered prudence an important virtue and perceived excess and overindulgence to be contrary to the attainment of ataraxia and aponia.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nEpicurus referred \"the good\", and \"even wisdom and culture\", to the \"pleasure of the stomach\".<ref>Cyril Bailey, Epicurus: The Extant Remains, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1926, p.131</ref>  While twentieth-century commentary has generally sought to diminish this and related quotations, the consistency of the lower-case epicureanism of meals with Epicurean materialism overall has more recently been explained.<ref>Michael Symons, \"Epicurus, the foodies\u2019 philosopher\", pp. 13-30, in Fritz Allhoff and Dave Monroe, eds, Food & Philosophy: Eat, think, and be merry, Malden (MA, USA): Blackwell Publishing, 2007</ref>\nWhile Epicurus sought moderation at meals, he was also not averse to moderation in moderation, that is, to occasional luxury. Called \"The Garden\" for being based in what would have been a kitchen garden, his community also became known for its feasts of the twentieth (of the Greek month).\n\n==Criticism==\n[[Francis Bacon]] wrote an apothegm related to Epicureanism:\n \n<blockquote>There was an Epicurean vaunted, that divers of other sects of philosophers did after turn Epicureans, but there was never any Epicurean that turned to any other sect. Whereupon a philosopher that was of another sect, said; The reason was plain, for that cocks may be made capons, but capons could never be made cocks.<ref>Francis Bacon, Apothegms 280</ref>  </blockquote>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Philosophy}}\n{{Wikipedia books|Epicureanism}}\n* [[Charvaka]], a hedonic Indian school\n* [[Dehellenization]]\n* ''[[Epicurea]]''\n* [[Epicurean paradox]]\n* [[Epikoros]]\n* [[Hedonic treadmill]]\n* [[List of English translations of De rerum natura|List of English translations of ''De rerum natura'']]\n* [[Philosophy of happiness]]\n* [[Separation of church and state]]\n* [[Zeno of Sidon]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Dane R.

I believe [clinicians] should ask patients and their families whether there is a family history of bipolar disorder or psychosis before prescribing these medications.

I believe [clinicians] should ask patients and their families whether there is a family history of bipolar disorder or psychosis before prescribing these medications.

In 1920, psychiatrist [[Emil Kraepelin]] (1856{{ndash}}1926), the founder of contemporary scientific psychiatry, observed a \"great number\" of cases that had characteristics of both groups of psychoses that he originally posited were two distinct and separate illnesses, ''dementia praecox'' (now called schizophrenia) and ''manic depressive insanity'' (now called bipolar disorders [plural since there are more than one type of bipolar disorder] and recurrent depression).<ref name=\"Goodwin & Marneros. p190\" />\n\nKraepelin acknowledged that \"there are many overlaps in this area,\" that is, the area between schizophrenia and mood disorders.<ref>{{harvnb|Marneros|Akiskal|2007|pages=3\u20134}}.</ref> In 1959, psychiatrist [[Kurt Schneider]] (1887{{ndash}}1967) began to further refine conceptualizations of the different forms that schizoaffective disorders can take since he observed \"concurrent and sequential types\".<ref name=\"Goodwin & Marneros. p190\" /> (The ''concurrent type'' of illness he referred to is a longitudinal course of illness with episodes of mood disorder and psychosis occurring predominantly at the same time [now called psychotic mood disorders or affective psychosis]; while his ''sequential type'' refers to a longitudinal course predominantly marked by alternating mood and psychotic episodes.)<ref name=\"Goodwin & Marneros. p189\" /> Schneider described schizoaffective disorders as \"cases in-between\" the traditional Kraepelinian dichotomy of schizophrenia and mood disorders.<ref name=\"Goodwin & Marneros. p189\" />\n\nThe historical clinical observation that schizoaffective disorder is an overlap of schizophrenia and mood disorders is explained by genes for both illnesses being present in individuals with schizoaffective disorder; specifically, recent research shows that schizophrenia and mood disorders share common genes ''and'' polygenic variations.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Van Snellenberg JX, de Candia T | title = Meta-analytic evidence for familial coaggregation of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder | journal = Arch.

A telling sign of the frontman\u2019s burgeoning confidence comes on '''Elysium''' \u2013 a song that boasts a killer chorus but an even better final passage, as he belts out a series of absolutely massive sustained notes over a swelling choral section.

He sings like he has a point to prove throughout '''''The Burning'''''. A telling sign of the frontman\u2019s burgeoning confidence comes on '''Elysium''' \u2013 a song that boasts a killer chorus but an even better final passage, as he belts out a series of absolutely massive sustained notes over a swelling choral section. Equally impressive is his ability to extract emotion from a song.

[[Social distancing]] measures in prisons included visible marks, the closing of gyms and recreation halls, inmates being fed in smaller groups and visits from outside disallowed.
