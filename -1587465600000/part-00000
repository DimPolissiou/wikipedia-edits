In the early 1980s the banking industry in West Africa was dominated by foreign and state-owned banks. There were hardly any commercial banks in West Africa owned and managed by the African private sector. ETI was founded with the objective of filling this vacuum.\n\nThe Federation of West African Chambers of Commerce promoted and initiated a project for the creation of a private regional banking institution in West Africa. In 1984, Ecopromotions S.A. was incorporated. Its founding shareholders raised the seed capital for the feasibility studies and the promotional activities leading to the creation of ETI.\n\nIn October 1985, ETI was incorporated with an authorised capital of US$100 million. The initial paid up capital of US$32 million was raised from over 1,500 individuals and institutions from West African countries. The largest shareholder was the ECOWAS Fund for Cooperation, Compensation and Development (ECOWAS Fund), the development finance arm of ECOWAS. A Headquarters\u2019 Agreement was signed with the government of Togo in 1985 which granted ETI the status of an international organisation with the rights and privileges necessary for it to operate as a regional institution, including the status of a non-resident financial institution.\n\nETI has two specialised subsidiaries: Ecobank Development Corporation (EDC) and eProcess International (eProcess). EDC was incorporated with a broad mandate to develop Ecobank\u2019s investment banking and advisory businesses throughout the countries where Ecobank operates. EDC operates brokerage houses on all 3 stock exchanges in West Africa and has obtained licences to operate on the two stock exchanges in Central Africa: the Douala Stock Exchange in Cameroon and the Libreville Exchange in Gabon. The mandate of eProcess is to manage the Group\u2019s information technology function with a view to ultimately centralising the Group\u2019s middle and back office operations to improve efficiency, service standards and reduce costs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecobank.com/aboutus.aspx|title=About Us|work=ecobank.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131002151/http://www.ecobank.com/aboutus.aspx|archivedate=31 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Governance lapses ==\nEcobank has been marred by several well publicized governance lapses:\n\nThe sacking and reinstatement of the CFO in 2014 after she alleged:  \"...

However, most of the legislators joined the [[Democratic Party of Japan (1996\u201398)|Democratic Party of Japan]] after that. Five leftist legislators who did not join the SDP formed the [[New Socialist Party (Japan)|New Socialist Party]] which lost all its seats in the following elections. The SDP enjoyed a short period of government participation from 1993 to 1994 as part of the [[Morihiro Hosokawa#Cabinet|Hosokawa cabinet]] and later formed a coalition government with the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] (LDP) under 81st [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Tomiichi Murayama]] of the JSP from 1994 to January 1996. The SDP was part of ruling coalitions between January and November 1996 (first [[Ryutaro Hashimoto|Hashimoto]] cabinet) and from 2009 to 2010 ([[Yukio Hatoyama#Cabinet|Hatoyama cabinet]]).\n\nAfter the [[2019 Japanese House of Councillors election|2019 House of Councillors election]], it has four representatives in the national Diet, two in the lower house and two in the upper house.\n\n[[File:Social Democratic Party of Japan - campaginvan - dec13-2012.jpg|thumb|A SDPJ campaign van outside a station in December 2012]]\n\n== History ==\n===Before 2000===\n{{main|Japan Socialist Party}}\nIn January 1996, the New Socialist Party split off, Murayama resigned as Prime Minister and the JSP changed its name from the JSP to the Social Democratic Party (SDP) as an interim party for forming a new party. However, a movement for transforming the SDP into a new social-democratic and liberal party was unsuccessful. Under Murayama's successor [[Ry\u016btar\u014d Hashimoto]] (LDP), the SDP remained part of the ruling coalition. Long before the disappointing result in the [[1996 Japanese general election|1996 general election]], the party lost the majority of its members of the House of Representatives, mainly to predecessors of the [[Democratic Party (Japan, 1996)|Democratic Party of Japan]] (DPJ) that was formed in 1996, but also some to the NFP and other opposition parties. After its electoral defeat in the 1996 general election when it lost another 15 of its remaining 30 seats in the lower house, the SDP left the ruling coalition which it had entered as the second largest force in Japanese politics as a minor party.\n\n=== 2000s\u20132010s ===\nThe SDP won six seats in the [[2003 Japanese general election|2003 general election]], compared with 18 seats in the previous [[2000 Japanese general election|2000 general election]]. Its motives against the Self-Defense Forces have reverted into abolishing it in the long term, returning into its opposition against the force it had applied in the 1950s.\n\nDoi had been the leader since 1996, but she resigned in 2003, taking responsibility for the election losses. [[Mizuho Fukushima]] was elected as the new party leader in November 2003. In the [[2004 Japanese House of Councillors election|2004 House of Councillors elections]], the SDP won only two seats, having five seats in the [[House of Councillors (Japan)|House of Councillors]] and six seats in the [[House of Representatives (Japan)|House of Representatives]]. In 2006, the party unexpectedly gained the governorship of the [[Shiga Prefecture]]. In the [[2009 Japanese general election|2009 general election]], the DPJ made large gains and the SDP maintained its base of 7 seats in the, becoming a junior partner in a new government coalition. However, disagreements over the issue of the [[Futenma]] base led to the sacking of Fukushima from the cabinet on 28 May and the SDP subsequently voted to leave the ruling coalition.<ref>BBC News [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10193171 Socialists leave Japan coalition over Okinawa issue] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101103120947/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10193171 |date=2010-11-03 }}</ref>\n\nAs of October 2010, the SDP had six members in the House of Representatives<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shugiin.go.jp/index.nsf/html/index_e_strength.htm|title=The House of Representatives|publisher=National Diet of Japan|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110322185742/http://www.shugiin.go.jp/index.nsf/html/index_e_strength.htm|archive-date=22 March 2011|access-date=7 May 2017}}</ref> and four members in the House of Councillors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sangiin.go.jp/eng/member/members/index.htm|title=List of the Members|publisher=National Diet of Japan|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110322230318/http://www.sangiin.go.jp/eng/member/members/index.htm|archive-date=22 March 2011|access-date=7 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[2012 Japanese general election|2012 general election]], the party retained only six seats in the whole of the Diet, two in the House of Representatives and four in the House of Councillors.

However, most of the legislators joined the [[Democratic Party of Japan (1996\u201398)|Democratic Party of Japan]] after that. Five leftist legislators who did not join the SDP formed the [[New Socialist Party (Japan)|New Socialist Party]] which lost all its seats in the following elections. The SDP enjoyed a short period of government participation from 1993 to 1994 as part of the [[Morihiro Hosokawa#Cabinet|Hosokawa cabinet]] and later formed a coalition government with the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] (LDP) under 81st [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Tomiichi Murayama]] of the JSP from 1994 to January 1996. The SDP was part of ruling coalitions between January and November 1996 (first [[Ryutaro Hashimoto|Hashimoto]] cabinet) and from 2009 to 2010 ([[Yukio Hatoyama#Cabinet|Hatoyama cabinet]]).\n\nAfter the [[2019 Japanese House of Councillors election|2019 House of Councillors election]], it has four representatives in the national Diet, two in the lower house and two in the upper house.\n\n[[File:Social Democratic Party of Japan - campaginvan - dec13-2012.jpg|thumb|A SDPJ campaign van outside a station in December 2012]]\n\n== History ==\n===Before 2000===\n{{main|Japan Socialist Party}}\nIn January 1996, the New Socialist Party split off, Murayama resigned as Prime Minister and the JSP changed its name from the JSP to the Social Democratic Party (SDP) as an interim party for forming a new party. However, a movement for transforming the SDP into a new social-democratic and liberal party was unsuccessful. Under Murayama's successor [[Ry\u016btar\u014d Hashimoto]] (LDP), the SDP remained part of the ruling coalition. Long before the disappointing result in the [[1996 Japanese general election|1996 general election]], the party lost the majority of its members of the House of Representatives, mainly to predecessors of the [[Democratic Party (Japan, 1996)|Democratic Party of Japan]] (DPJ) that was formed in 1996, but also some to the NFP and other opposition parties. After its electoral defeat in the 1996 general election when it lost another 15 of its remaining 30 seats in the lower house, the SDP left the ruling coalition which it had entered as the second largest force in Japanese politics as a minor party.\n\n=== 2000s\u20132010s ===\nThe SDP won six seats in the [[2003 Japanese general election|2003 general election]], compared with 18 seats in the previous [[2000 Japanese general election|2000 general election]]. Its motives against the Self-Defense Forces have reverted into abolishing it in the long term, returning into its opposition against the force it had applied in the 1950s.\n\nDoi had been the leader since 1996, but she resigned in 2003, taking responsibility for the election losses. [[Mizuho Fukushima]] was elected as the new party leader in November 2003. In the [[2004 Japanese House of Councillors election|2004 House of Councillors elections]], the SDP won only two seats, having five seats in the [[House of Councillors (Japan)|House of Councillors]] and six seats in the [[House of Representatives (Japan)|House of Representatives]]. In 2006, the party unexpectedly gained the governorship of the [[Shiga Prefecture]]. In the [[2009 Japanese general election|2009 general election]], the DPJ made large gains and the SDP maintained its base of 7 seats in the, becoming a junior partner in a new government coalition. However, disagreements over the issue of the [[Futenma]] base led to the sacking of Fukushima from the cabinet on 28 May and the SDP subsequently voted to leave the ruling coalition.<ref>BBC News [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10193171 Socialists leave Japan coalition over Okinawa issue] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101103120947/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10193171 |date=2010-11-03 }}</ref>\n\nAs of October 2010, the SDP had six members in the House of Representatives<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shugiin.go.jp/index.nsf/html/index_e_strength.htm|title=The House of Representatives|publisher=National Diet of Japan|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110322185742/http://www.shugiin.go.jp/index.nsf/html/index_e_strength.htm|archive-date=22 March 2011|access-date=7 May 2017}}</ref> and four members in the House of Councillors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sangiin.go.jp/eng/member/members/index.htm|title=List of the Members|publisher=National Diet of Japan|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110322230318/http://www.sangiin.go.jp/eng/member/members/index.htm|archive-date=22 March 2011|access-date=7 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[2012 Japanese general election|2012 general election]], the party retained only six seats in the whole of the Diet, two in the House of Representatives and four in the House of Councillors.

The remnant of the [[Byzantine Empire]] is visible in the west; the [[Seljuk Empire]] and [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid Egypt]] are shown in green.|alt=Map of the states of the eastern Mediterranean in 1135]]\n\n'''{{lang|fr|Outremer}}''', also known as the '''Crusader states''', were [[Feudalism|feudal]] [[Christian state]]s in the [[Eastern Mediterranean|Eastern Mediterranean. They were]] established at the end of the 11th and the beginning of the 12th{{nbsp}}century as a consequence of the [[First Crusade]]. These states in the [[Levant]] were the first examples of \"Europe overseas\" and became known to historians by the [[French language|French]] version of the phrase, {{lang|fr|Outremer}}. A presence remained in the region in some form until the [[Siege of Acre (1291)|fall]] of [[Acre,_Israel|Acre]] in 1291 led to the rapid loss of the last remaining holdings. The crusade was proclaimed by [[Pope Urban II]] at the [[Council of Clermont]] in 1095. He encouraged military support for the [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Alexios I Komnenos|Alexios{{nbsp}}I]] against the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk]] Turks and an armed pilgrimage to Jerusalem. There was an enthusiastic response in [[Western Europe]] across all social strata. This, and later campaigns, established four crusader states in the [[Near East]]: the [[County of Edessa]]; the [[Principality of Antioch]]; the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]; and the [[County of Tripoli]]. \n\nThe crusader states were frontier societies with a minority Frankish populations ruling indigenous populations culturally related to the neighbouring communities. The states were politically and legally stratified with the Franks controlling the relationships between self-governing and ethnically-based communities. Society was divided between Frank and non-Frank, not between Christian and Muslim. Few Franks could speak more than basic Arabic, instead relying on indigenous interpreters and headmen. Indigenous  courts administered civil disputes and minor criminality with more serious offences dealt with by the Frankish {{lang|fr|cour des bourgeois}} or courts of the burgesses, the name of the non-noble Franks. There is little evidence of assimilation. The archaeology is culturally exclusive and written evidence indicates deep religious divisions. Large differences in status and wealth existed between urban and rural dwellers; indigenous Christians were able gain higher status and acquire wealth through commerce and industry in towns, but few Muslims lived in urban areas. Muslim and indigenous Christian populations tended to seperation rather than integration. Greek Orthodox communities proved resilient with many surviving the Arab conquest, rule by the Crusaders and for centuries after the fall of the crusader states. Other indigenous communities included Palestinian Christians, Arabic speaking members of the [[Jacobite Syrian Christian Church]] and [[Maronite Church]], [[Armenians]] as well well as [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]], [[Shia Islam|Shia]] and [[Druze]] Muslims. \n\nFew artistic styles originated in the crusader states. One that did was a military architecture that demonstrated a synthesis of the European, Byzantine and Muslim traditions; with the inclusion of oriental design features such as large water reservoirs and the exclusion of occidental features like moats.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=295\u2013296}} Early church design was in the [[French Romanesque architecture|French Romanesque]] style. The 12th-century rebuilding of the Holy Sepulchre retained some of the Byzantine details, but added new arches and chapels in northern French, Aquitanian and Proven\u00e7al styles. In sculpture little trace of an indigenous influence remains. In contrast the visual culture demonstrates the influence of indigenous artists. Decoration of shrines, painting and the production of manuscripts and the adoption of methods from the Byzantine and indigenous artists and iconographical practice. Monumental and panel painting, mosaics and illuminations in manuscripts adopted an indigenous style. Wall mosaics were unknown in the west but were widespread in the crusader states.\n\n==Background==\n\n{{Further|Spread of Islam|Crusades|Muslim conquests|Byzantine\u2013Seljuk wars|Arab\u2013Byzantine wars}}\n\n[[File:Map of expansion of Caliphate.svg|upright=1.3|thumb|Map of the early Arab conquests|alt=Map of the early Arab conquests]] Beginning in the 7th century, following the foundation of the [[Islam|Islamic religion]] by [[Muhammad]], and through the 8th century, Muslim [[Arabs]] under the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] captured [[Muslim conquest of Syria|Syria]], [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Egypt]], [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Iran]], [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|the Levant]] and [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb|North Africa]] from the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Sasanian Empire]]s, and [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Iberia]] from the [[Visigothic Kingdom]].{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|pp=51\u201354}} In 750 a bloody coup brought an end to Umayyad rule, leading to the gradual fragmentation of the monolithic Islamic state and the relocation of the political and economic centre of the Islamic world from Palestine to Iran and Iraq.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=18}} By the end of the 11th century the age of Islamic territorial expansion was long gone.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=40}} However, frontier conditions between the Christian and Muslim world remained militant across the Mediterranean area. From the 8th century, in what later became known as the ''[[Reconquista]]'', Christians were campaigning in Spain. In the 11th century [[Normans|Norman]] adventurers led by [[Roger I of Sicily|Roger de Hauteville]], later King Roger I of Sicily, seized [[Emirate of Sicily|Sicily]] from the Muslims.{{sfn|Mayer|1988|pp=17\u201318}} The [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] Christian Byzantine Empire in the early 11th century stretched east to Iran and controlled Bulgaria and much of southern Italy in the west. However, from this point the arrival of new enemies on all frontiers placed intolerable strains on the resources of both the Byzantine Empire and the neighbouring Arab Muslim regimes.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=42\u201346}} The situation was a serious threat to the future of the Byzantine Empire. This made the possibility of western military aid from the Papacy for specific campaigns an attractive prospect to the Byzantines.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=46}}{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=27}}\n\nThere were three waves of [[Turkic migration]] into the Middle East. The initial phase began in the 9th{{nbsp}}century with the use use of captured Turkic nomads as slave soldiers by the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] dynasty rulers of Baghdad and others across the [[Middle East]]. These were known as [[ghulam]] or [[mamluk]]s. The [[steppe]] Turks skills in horsemanship and archery were particularly valued. It was expected that these slaves would remain loyal. However on conversion to Islam they were emancipated so there was no obstacle preventing these Turks progressing from roles as guards, as commanders, governors, dynastic founders and eventually king makers.{{sfn|Findley|2005|pp=65\u201368}} The result was Turkic dynasties in Egypt and Syria most notably the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] that destroyed the {{lang|fr|Outremer}} in the 13th{{nbsp}}century.{{sfn|Holt|1986|pp=6\u20137}} The second phase was led by a minor ruling clan of [[Oghuz Turks]] from [[Transoxania]] collectively known as [[Seljuk dynasty|Seljuks]] after the founder, [[Seljuk (warlord)|Salj\u016bq]]. This created a sizable ethnic Turkish presence. In the mid-11th{{nbsp}}century the Seljuks supplanted the [[Ghaznavids]] in [[Khurasan]], extending mastery through Khurasan and into [[Iran]] all the way to Baghdad. There the [[List of Abbasid caliphs|Abbasid caliph]] granted [[Tughril]] the title {{lang|ae|[[Sultan]]}}, ''power'' in [[arabic]], who was the first ruler to use this title on coinage. This ascent resulted in the [[Great Seljuk Empire]], {{sfn|Findley|2005|pp=68\u201369}} and the [[Seljuq dynasty|House of Seljuk]] assimilated into Perso-arabic culture. The Empire was not centralised or a coherent whole, rather a loose assemply of provinces with differing languages and nationalities. Traditinally these were ruled as a family concern rather than by a single monarch.{{sfn|Holt|1986|p=11}} \n\n[[File:Aftermath of Manzikert.png|left|upright=1.5|thumb|Battles between Byzantines and the Turks for the control of Anatolia in the 1070s.|left|alt=Map of the Mediterranean Sea with the extent of the Byzantine Empire highlighted]]The first two phases of Turkic migration involved the arrival of the Turks into Arab Islamic territory and not significantly impacting the culture. The third, into Anatolia, was different as it impacted {{lang|ar|Bil\u0101d al-R\u016bm}}, the ''land of the Romans'' i.e. the Byzantine Greeks ruling what remained of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. Prior to the arrival of the Turks the Byzantines were on the offensive. They captured Antioch after three centuries of Arab rule and invaded Syria. Turkish [[Ghazi (warrior)|Ghazi]] and their Byzantine equivalents, {{lang|grc|[[Akritai]]}}, often Turkish themselves, indulged in ephemeral cross border raiding until the Great Suljuk Sultan [[Alp Arslan]] interrupted campaigning in Egypt to sucure his northern borders and defeated Byzantine Emperor [[Romanos IV Diogenes]] at the [[Battle of Manzikert]].{{sfn|Holt|1986|pp=167\u2013168}} Historians once considered this a pivotal event but now Manzikert is regarded as only one step in the development of the [[Sultanate of Rum]].{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=27}} Alp Arslan had no ambition to expand into Anatolia but the resulting collapse in the authority of the Byzantine Empire allowed the ghazi and nomadic tribesmen seeking pasture for flocks and herds to flood into the now ungoverned lands. Alp Arslan's cousin [[Suleiman ibn Qutulmish]] exploited Byzantine factionalism and carved out a new realm in Anatolia, seizing [[Cilicia]] from an Armenian warlord in 1073 and peacefully entering Antioch in 1084. Eventually, he came into conflict with the Great Seljuk Empire and was defeated and killed in 1092.{{sfn|Holt|1986|p=168}} This formed part of a wider disintegration in the Middle East. In the same year the [[vizier]] and effective ruler of the Great Seljuk Empire, [[Nizam al-Mulk]] died closely followed by the Sultan [[Malik-Shah I|Malik-Shah]] and the Fatimid khalif, [[Al-Mustansir Billah]]. The Islamic historian [[Carole Hillenbrand]] has described this as analogous to the fall of the [[Iron Curtain]] in 1989 with the phrase \"familiar political entities gave way to disorientation and disunity\".{{sfn|Hillenbrand|1999|p=33}} The confusion and division meant the Islamic world disregarded the world beyond; this made it vulnerable to, and surprised by, the First Crusade.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=41}}. Another {{lang|ar|ghazi}} [[Danishmendids|state]] was founded at the time as the Sultanate of Rum, in north and central Anatolia by someone known by the Persian honourific [[Danishmend Gazi]]. His son, [[Gazi G\u00fcm\u00fcshtigin]], captured [[Bohemond I of Antioch]] and in alliance with Suleiman's son [[Kilij Arslan I|Kilij Arslan]] defeated two crusading contingents in 1100.{{sfn|Holt|1986|p=169}}\n\n[[File:Anatolia 1097.svg|upright=1.5|thumb|[[Anatolia]] in 1097 prior to the [[Siege of Nicaea]]|alt=Map of Anatolia in 1097 prior to the Siege of Nicaea]]In 1095 the Byzantine emperor, [[Alexios I Komnenos]], requested military support from the [[Council of Piacenza]] for the fight with the Turks. Later that year, at the Council of Clermont, Pope Urban supported this and exhorted war.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=30}} This prompted a popular outbreak amongst poor Christians, led by the French priest [[Peter the Hermit]], known as the [[People's Crusade]]. Passing through Germany they indulged in wide-ranging anti-Jewish activities and [[Rhineland massacres|massacres]]. On leaving Byzantine-controlled territory in Anatolia they were annihilated in a Turkish ambush at the [[Battle of Civetot]] in October 1096.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=41}} They were followed by a feudal army that may have numbered 100,000 including non-combatant that was cautiously welcomed to Byzantium by Alexios late in 1096.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=43\u201348}} He made them promise to return all recovered Byzantine territory{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=50\u201361}} These promises were not kept, for example [[Bohemond I of Antioch]] retained Antioch when it was captured, rather than returning it and fought with the Byzantines for a decade until his failure in Italy at the [[Siege of Dyrrhachium (1107\u20131108)]].{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=72\u201382}}{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=142\u2013149}}\n\nAfter the [[First Crusade]], [[Godfrey of Bouillon]] was left with only 300 knights and 2,000 infantry to defend the territory won in the Eastern Mediterranean. Of the crusader princes only [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Tancred]] remained, with the aim of establishing his own lordship.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=106}} At this point the [[Franks]], as the western European crusaders were commonly known, held only Jerusalem, [[Antioch]] and [[Edessa]] but not the surrounding country. Jerusalem remained economically sterile, despite the advantages of being the centre of administration for church and state and benefiting from streams of [[pilgrim]]s.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|p=87}} Consolidation in the first half of the 12th-century established four crusader states:\n* The [[County of Edessa]] (1098\u20131149){{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=60\u201361}}\n* The [[Principality of Antioch]] (1098\u20131268){{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=82\u201388}}\n* The [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], founded in 1099, lasted until 1291,{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=103\u2013104}} when the city of [[Akko|Acre]] fell.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=651\u2013656}}\n* The [[County of Tripoli]] (1104\u20131289, although the city of [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] itself remained in Muslim control until 1109){{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=147\u201350}}\n\n==Demography==\n\nModern research based on historical geography techniques indicate that Muslims and indigenous Christian populations integrated less than had been previously thought. Palestinian Christians lived around Jerusalem and in an arc stretching from [[Jericho]] and [[Jordan River|the Jordan]] to [[Hebron]] in the south.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=131}} Comparing archaeological research on Byzantine churches built before the Muslim conquest and Ottoman census records from the 16th{{nbsp}}century demonstrates that some Greek Orthodox communities had disappeared before the crusades but most continued for centuries after the fall of the crusader states. [[Maronites]] were concentrated in Tripoli; Jacobites in Antioch and Edessa. Armenians were concentrated in the north but communities existed in all major towns. Palestine's central areas had a Muslim majority population. The Muslims were mainly Sunnis, but Shi'ite communities existed in [[Galilee]]. The nonconformist Muslim [[Druze]]s were recorded living in the mountains of Tripoli. The Jewish population resided in coastal towns and some Galilean villages.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=131\u2013132}}{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=49,51}}\n\nWith the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|capture of Jerusalem]] and [[Battle of Ascalon|victory at Ascalon]] the majority of the crusaders considered their [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] complete and returned to Europe.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=104\u2013106}} The Frankish population of the Kingdom of Jerusalem became concentrated in three major cities. By the 13th{{nbsp}}century the population of Acre probably exceeded 60,000, then came [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], with the capital being the smallest of the three with a population somewhere between 20,000 and 30,000.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|p=82}} At its zenith, the Latin population of the region reached {{circa|250,000}} with the Kingdom of Jerusalem's population numbering {{circa|120,000}} and the combined total in Tripoli, Antioch and Edessa being broadly comparable.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|p=396}} The presence of Frankish peasants is evident in 235 villages, out of a total of some 1,200 rural settlements.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=150}}\n\nIn context, Josiah Russell estimates the population of what he calls \"Islamic territory\" as roughly 12.5&nbsp;million in 1000{{mdash}}Anatolia 8 million, Syria 2 million, Egypt 1.5 million and North Africa 1 million {{mdash}} with the European areas that provided crusaders having a population of 23.7 million. He estimates that by 1200 that these figures had risen to 13.7 million in Islamic territory{{mdash}}Anatolia 7 million, Syria 2.7 million, Egypt 2.5 million and North Africa 1.5 million{{mdash}} while the crusaders' home countries population was 35.6&nbsp;million. Russell acknowledges that much of Anatolia was Christian or under the Byzantines and that some purportedly Islamic areas such as Mosul and Baghdad had significant Christian populations.{{sfn|Russell|1985|p=298}}\n\n==Society==\n\n{{lang|fr|Outremer}} was frontier society with a Frankish elite ruling a indigenous population related to the neighbouring communities, many of whom were hostile to the Franks.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=17\u201319}} It was politically and legally stratified, with self-governing, ethnically-based communities. Relations between communities were controlled by the Franks.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|p=127}} The basic division in society was between Frank and non-Frank, and not between Christian and Muslim. All Franks were considered free men, while the indigenous peoples lived like western [[serfs]]. Conversion to Latin Christianity was their only route to full citizenship. The Franks imposed officials in order to use the military, legal and administrative systems to control the indigenous peoples. Few Franks could speak more than basic Arabic. [[Dragoman]]s{{mdash}}interpreters{{mdash}}and ''[[Rais|ru\u02beas\u0101\u02be]]''{{mdash}}village headmen{{mdash}}were used as mediators. Civil disputes and minor criminality were administered by the courts of the indigenous communities, but more serious offences and cases involving Franks were dealt with by the Frankish {{lang|fr|cour des bourgeois}} or courts of the burgesses, the name given to the non-noble Franks.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|p=81}} The lack of material evidence makes it difficult to identify the level of assimilation. The archaeology is culturally exclusive and written evidence indicates deep religious division, although some historians assume that {{lang|fr|Outremer}}'s heterogeneity eroded formal apartheid.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|pp=126\u2013136}} The key differentiator in status and economic position was between urban and rural dwellers. Indigenous Christians could gain higher status and acquire wealth through commerce and industry in towns, but few Muslims lived in urban areas except those in servitude.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=128\u2013130}}\n\nFrankish courts reflected the region's diversity. [[Melisende, Queen of Jerusalem|Queen Melisende]] was part Armenian and married Fulk from Anjou. Their son Amalric, first married a Frank from the Levant, then a Byzantine Greek. William of Tyre was appalled at the use of Jewish, Syrian and Muslim physicians, who were popular among the nobility. Greek and Arabic speaking Christians made Antioch a centre of cultural interchange. The indigenous peoples showed the Frankish nobility traditional deference. Some Franks adopted the their dress, food, housing and military techniques. This does not mean that {{lang|fr|Outremer}} was a cultural melting pot. Inter-communal relations were shallow, separate identities were maintained and other communities were considered alien.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|pp=127,131,136\u2013141}}\n\n==Economy==\n\nIn addition to being economic centres themselves, the crusader states provided an obstacle to Muslim trade by sea with the west and to the land routes from [[Mesopotamia]] and Syria to the great urban economies of the Nile. Despite hostility, commerce continued, coastal cities remained maritime outlets for the Islamic hinterland and eastern wares were exported to Europe in unprecedented volumes. The Byzantine-Muslim mercantile growth in the 12th{{nbsp}}and{{nbsp}}13th{{nbsp}}centuries may have occurred anyway, as the Western European economy was booming due to population growth; this increased wealth and created a growing social class demanding city centred products and eastern imports, but it is likely that the Crusades hastened the developments. European fleets were expanded, better ships built, navigation improved and fare paying pilgrims subsidised many voyages. Agricultural production, largely the domain of the indigenous population, flourished before the fall of the First Kingdom in 1187, but was negligible afterwards. Franks, Muslims, Jews and indigenous Christians traded crafts in the [[souks]], teeming oriental bazaars, of the cities.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|p=382}}  The Italian, Proven\u00e7al and Catalan merchants monopolised shipping, imports, exports, transportation and banking. The Frankish noble and ecclesiastical institutional income was based on income from estates, market tolls and taxation.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=352\u2013354}} The main centres of production were Antioch, Tripoli, Tyre and, less importantly, Beirut. Textiles, glass, dyestuffs, olives, wine, sesame oil and sugar were exported; silk was particularly prized.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=392\u2013393}} The Frankish population, estimated at roughly a quarter of a million people, provided an import market for clothing and finished goods.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=396\u2013397}}\n\n==Coinage==\n\n[[File:crusader coins of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|350px|Crusader coins of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.

Right: gold bezant with Christian symbol (1250s)]]\nThe Franks adopted the more monetised indigenous economic system, using a hybrid coinage: predominantly northern Italian and southern French silver European coins; Frankish variant copper coins minted in Arabic and Byzantine styles; and silver and gold [[dirham]]s and [[dinar]]s. After 1124, Egyptian dinars were copied, creating Jerusalem's gold [[bezant]]. Following the collapse of {{lang|fr|Outremer}} in 1187, trade, rather than agriculture, increasingly dominated the economy and western coins began dominating the coinage in circulation. Although lords in Tyre, Sidon and Beirut minted silver pennies and copper coins there is little evidence of systematic attempts to create a unified currency.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|pp=120\u2013121}}\n\n==Monarchy==\n\nDuring the period of near constant warfare in the early decades of the 12th{{nbsp}}century, the king of Jerusalem's foremost role was leader of the feudal host. They very rarely awarded land or lordships, and those awarded that became vacant\u2014a frequent event due to the high mortality rate in the conflict\u2014reverted to the crown. Instead their followers' loyalty was rewarded with city incomes. As a result, the royal domain of the first five rulers {{mdash}}including much of Judea, Samaria, the coast from Jaffa to Ascalon, the ports of Acre and Tyre, and other scattered castles and territories{{mdash}}was larger that the combined holdings of the nobility. This meant that the rulers of Jerusalem had greater internal power than comparative western monarchs, although they did not have the necessary administrative systems and personnel to govern such a large realm.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=104\u2013105}}\n\n[[File:Principado de Galileen.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|Map of the feudatories of the Kingdom of Jerusalem in 1187|alt=Map of the feudatories of the Kingdom of Jerusalem in 1187]]The situation evolved in the second quarter of the century with the establishment of baronial dynasties. Magnates{{mdash}}such as [[Raynald of Ch\u00e2tillon]], Lord of [[Oultrejordain]], and [[Raymond III, Count of Tripoli]], [[Principality of Galilee|Prince of Galilee]]{{mdash}}often acted as autonomous rulers. Royal powers were abrogated and effectively governance was undertaken within the feudatories. What central control remained was exercised at the {{lang|la|[[Haute Cour]]}}{{mdash}}High Court, in English. Only the 13th{{nbsp}}century [[jurists]] of Jerusalem used this term, {{lang|la|[[curia regis]]}} was more common in Europe. These were meetings between the king and his tenants in chief. Over time the duty of the vassal to give counsel developed into a privilege and ultimately the legitimacy of the monarch depended on the agreement of the court.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|p=112}} The barons of Jerusalem in the 13th{{nbsp}}century have been poorly regarded by both contemporary and modern commentators: James of Vitry was disgusted by their superficial rhetoric; the historian [[Jonathan Riley-Smith]] writes of their pedantry and the use of spurious legal justification for political action.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=226}}\n\nIn practice, the High Court consisted of the great barons and the king's direct vassals. In law a quorum was the king and three tenants in chief. The 1162 {{lang|fr|[[assise sur la ligece]]}} theoretically expanded the court's membership to all 600 or more fief-holders, making them all peers. All those who paid homage directly to the king were now members of the {{lang|la|Haute Cour}} of Jerusalem. They were joined by the heads of the military orders by the end of the 12th{{nbsp}}century, and the Italian communes in the 13th{{nbsp}}century.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=112\u2013117}} Before the defeat at Hattin in 1187 the laws developed by the court were documented as {{lang|fr|[[assises]]}} in ''Letters of the Holy Sepulchre''.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|p=122}} The entire body of written law was lost in the subsequent fall of Jerusalem. From this point the legal system was largely based on custom and the memory of the lost legislation. The renowned jurist [[Philip of Novara]] lamented \"We know [the laws] rather poorly, for they are known by hearsay and usage...and we think an assize is something we have seen as an assize...in the kingdom of Jerusalem [the barons] made much better use of the laws and acted on them more surely before the land was lost\". Thus a myth was created of an idyllic early 12th{{nbsp}}century legal system. The barons used this to reinterpret the {{lang|fr|assise sur la ligece}}, which Almalric I intended to strengthen the crown, to instead constrain the monarch, particularly with regards to the right of the monarch to remove feudal fiefs without trial. The concomitant loss of the vast majority of rural fiefs led to the barons becoming an urban mercantile class where knowledge of the law was a valuable, well-regarded skill and a career path to higher status.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=228}}\n\nThe leaders of the [[Third Crusade]] ignored the monarchy of Jerusalem; the kings of England and France agreed on the division of future conquests as if there was no need to take into account the nobility of the crusader states. The historian [[Joshua Prawer]] considered that the weakness of the crown of Jerusalem was demonstrated by the rapid offering of the throne to Conrad of Montferrat in 1190 and then [[Henry II, Count of Champagne]] in 1192.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=107\u2013108}} Emperor Frederick II married [[Isabella II of Jerusalem|Queen Isabella]] in 1225 and immediately claimed the throne of Jerusalem from her father, the King Regent, [[John of Brienne]]. In 1228 Isabella died after giving birth to a son, [[Conrad IV of Germany|Conrad]], who through his mother was now legally king of Jerusalem and Frederick's heir.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=563\u2013571}} From 1229 when Frederick II left the Holy Land to defend his Italian and German lands, monarchs were absent{{mdash}}Conrad from 1225 until 1254, his son [[Conradin]] until his execution by Charles of Anjou in 1268. Government in Jerusalem had developed in the opposite direction to monarchies in the west. St Louis, Emperor Frederick and Kind Edward I\u2014contemporary rulers of France, Germany and England respectively\u2014 were powerful, with centralised bureaucracies. Jerusalem had a royalty without power.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|p=104}} Magnates such as the [[House of Ibelin|Ibelins]] attempted to seize the regency, fighting for control with an Italian army led by Frederick's viceroy [[Richard Filangieri]] in the [[War of the Lombards]]. Tyre, the [[Knights Hospitaller|Hospitallers]], the [[Teutonic Knights]] and [[Republic of Pisa|Pisa]] supported Filangieri. In opposition were the Ibelins, Acre, the [[Knights Templar|Templars]] and Genoa. The rebels established a surragate commune, or parliament, for twelve years in Acre.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=229}} They prevailed in 1242 with the capture of Tyre and a succession of Ibelin and Cypriot regents followed.{{sfn|Tyerman |2019|p=268}} Centralised government collapsed while the nobility, military orders and Italian communes took the lead. Three Cypriot [[House of Lusignan|Lusignan]] kings succeeded without the financial or military resources to recover the lost territory. The title of king was even sold to Charles of Anjou, but although he gained power for a short while, he never visited the kingdom. The king of Cyprus fought at Acre until all hope was lost and then returned to his island realm.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=108\u2013109}} Cyprus survived the fall of the mainland crusader states and [[Peter I of Cyprus]] launched the [[Alexandrian Crusade|last crusade against Egypt]] that temporarily captured Alexandria in 1365.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|p=392}}\n\n==Religion==\n\nPartly a result of anti-Orthodox sentiment the early crusaders filled ecclesiastical positions in the Orthodox church left vacant with Franks, including the patriarchy of Jerusalem when [[Simeon II of Jerusalem|Simeon II]] died. The Greek Orthodox Church was considered part of the universal Church, which enabled the replacement of Orthodox bishops by Latin clerics in coastal towns. The first Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, [[Arnulf of Chocques]], ejected the Greek Orthodox monks from the Holy Sepulchre but relented when the miracle of Easter Fire failed in their absence. The appointment of Latin bishops had little effect on the Arabic-speaking Orthodox Christians because the previous bishops were also foreign, from the Byzantine Empire. The Latin bishops used Greeks as [[coadjutor bishop]]s to administer Syrians and Greeks left without higher clergy. In many villages Latin and Orthodox Christians shared a church. In exceptional political circumstances, Greeks replaced Latin patriarchs in Antioch. Orthodox monasteries were rebuilt and Orthodox monastic life revived.  This toleration continued despite an increasingly interventionist papal reaction demonstrated by [[Jacques de Vitry]], [[Latin Catholic Diocese of Acre|Bishop of Acre]]. The Armenians, Copts, Jacobites, Nestorians and Maronites had greater autonomy. As they were not in communion with Rome they could retain their own bishops without a conflict of authority. Around 1181 [[Aimery of Limoges]], Patriarch of Antioch, managed to bring the Maronites into communion with Rome, establishing a precedent for the [[Eastern Catholic Churches#Uniate|Uniate Churches]].{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=134\u2013143}}\n\nThat religion prevented assimilation is evidenced by the Franks' discriminatory laws against Jews and Muslims. They were banned from living in Jerusalem and sexual relations between Muslims and Christians were punished by mutilation. Some mosques were converted into Christian churches, but the Franks did not force Muslims to convert to Christianity. Frankish lords were particularly reluctant, because conversion would have ended the Muslim peasants' servile status. The Muslims were permitted to pray in public and their [[hajj|pilgrimages to Mecca]] continued.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=127\u2013129}} The [[Samaritans]]' annual Passover festival attracted visitors from beyond the kingdom's borders.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|pp=131\u2013132}}\n\n==Communes==\n\nLargely located in the ports of Acre, Tyre, Tripoli and Sidon, [[commune]]s of Italians, Proven\u00e7als and Catalans had distinct cultural characteristics and exerted significant political power. Separate from the Frankish nobles or burgesses, the communes were autonomous political entities closely linked to their towns of origin. This gave them the ability to monopolise foreign trade and almost all banking and shipping in {{lang|fr|Outremer}}. Their parent cities' naval support was essential for the crusader states. Every opportunity to extend trade privileges was taken. One example saw the Venetians receiving one-third of Tyre and its territories, and exemption from all taxes, after Venice participated in the successful [[Siege of Tyre (1124)|1124 siege of the city]]. Despite all efforts, the Syrian and Palestinian ports were unable to replace Alexandria and Constantinople as the primary centres of commerce in the region. Instead, the communes competed with the monarchs and each other to maintain economic advantage. Power derived from the support of the communards' home cities rather than their number, which never reached more than hundreds. Thus, by the middle of the 13th{{nbsp}}century, the rulers of the communes were barely required to recognise the authority of the crusaders and divided Acre into several fortified miniature republics.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=85\u201393}}{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=151\u2013152}}\n\n==Military orders==\n{{Main|Military order (religious society)}}\n[[Image:Baldwin II ceeding the Temple of Salomon to Ugo dei Pagani and Gaudefroy de Saint-Homer.jpg|thumb|13th-century miniature of [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem]] granting the captured [[Al Aqsa Mosque]] to [[Hugues de Payens]]|alt=13th-century miniature of King Baldwin II granting the captured Al Aqsa Mosque to Hugues de Payens]]\nThe crusaders' propensity to follow the customs of their Western European homelands meant that there were very few innovations developed from the culture in the crusader states. Three notable exceptions to this were the military orders, warfare and fortifications.{{sfn| Prawer|1972| p=252}} The Knights Hospitaller, formally the Order of Knights of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem, were founded in Jerusalem before the First Crusade but added a martial element to their ongoing medical functions to become a much larger military order.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=169}} In this way the knighthood entered the previously monastic and ecclesiastical sphere.{{sfn| Prawer|1972| p=253}}\n\nMilitary orders like the Knights Hospitaller and Knights Templar provided Latin Christendom's first professional armies in support of the Kingdom of Jerusalem and the other crusader states. The Templars, formally the Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and the Temple of Solomon, and their [[Al-Aqsa Mosque|Temple of Solomon]] were founded around 1119 by a small band of knights who dedicated themselves to protecting pilgrims en{{nbsp}}route to Jerusalem.{{sfn| Asbridge|2012| p= 168}} The Hospitallers and the Templars became supranational organisations as papal support led to rich donations of land and revenue across Europe. This, in turn, led to a steady flow of new recruits and the wealth to maintain multiple fortifications in the crusader states. In time, they developed into autonomous powers in the region.{{sfn| Asbridge|2012|pp=169\u2013170}} After the fall of Acre the Hospitallers first relocated to Cyprus, then conquered and ruled [[Rhodes]] (1309\u20131522) and Malta (1530\u20131798), and [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta|continue in existence to the present-day]]. King [[Philip IV of France]] probably had financial and political reasons to oppose the Knights Templar, which led to him exerting pressure on [[Pope Clement V]]. The pope responded in 1312, with a series of papal bulls including ''[[Vox in Excelso]]'' and ''[[Ad Providam]]'' that dissolved the order on the alleged and probably false grounds of sodomy, magic and heresy.{{sfn|Davies|1997|p=359}}\n\n==Art and architecture==\n{{Further|Art of the crusades|List of Crusader castles}}\n\n[[File:Crac des chevaliers syria.jpeg|thumb|12th-century [[Knights Hospitaller]] castle of [[Krak des Chevaliers]] in Syria, one of the first castles to use concentric fortification, i.e. concentric rings of defence that could all operate at the same time. It has two curtain walls and sits on a promontory.|alt=photograph of 12th-century Hospitaller castle of Krak des Chevaliers in Syria showing concentric rings of defence, curtain walls and location sitting on a promontory.]]According to Joshua Prawer no major European poet, theologian, scholar or historian settled in the crusader states. Some went on pilgrimage, and this is reflected in new imagery and ideas in western poetry. Although they did not migrate east themselves, their output often encouraged others to journey on pilgrimage to the east.{{sfn| Prawer|1972| p=468}}\n\nHistorians consider military architecture{{mdash}}demonstrating a synthesis of the European, Byzantine and Muslim traditions{{mdash}}the most original and impressive artistic achievement of the crusades. Castles were a tangible symbol of the dominance of a Latin Christian minority over a largely hostile majority population. They also acted as centres of administration.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=280\u2013281}} Modern historiography rejects the 19th-century consensus that Westerners learnt the basis of military architecture from the Near East, as Europe had already experienced rapid growth in defensive technology before the First Crusade. Direct contact with Arab fortifications originally constructed by the Byzantines did influence developments in the east. But the lack of documentary evidence means that it remains difficult to differentiate between the importance of this design culture and the constraints of situation, which led to the inclusion of oriental design features such as large water reservoirs and the exclusion of occidental features like moats.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=295\u2013296}}\n\nTypically, early church design was in the [[French Romanesque architecture|French Romanesque]] style. This can be seen in the 12th-century rebuilding of the Holy Sepulchre. It retained some of the earlier Byzantine details, but new arches and chapels were built to northern French, Aquitanian and Proven\u00e7al patterns. There is little trace of any surviving indigenous influence in sculpture, although in the Holy Sepulchre the [[Capital (architecture)|column capitals]] of the south facade follow classical Syrian patterns.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=146}}\n\nIn contrast to architecture and sculpture, it is in the area of visual culture that the assimilated nature of the society was demonstrated. Throughout the 12th and 13th centuries the influence of indigenous artists was demonstrated in the decoration of shrines, painting and the production of manuscripts. In addition, Frankish practitioners borrowed methods from the Byzantines and indigenous artists and iconographical practice. Monumental and panel painting, mosaics and illuminations in manuscripts adopted an indigenous style leading to a cultural synthesis illustrated by the [[Church of the Nativity]]. Wall mosaics were unknown in the west but in widespread use in the crusader states. Whether this was by indigenous craftsmen or learnt by Frankish ones is unknown, but a distinctive and original artistic style evolved.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=145\u2013146}}\n\nManuscripts were produced and illustrated in workshops housing Italian, French, English and indigenous craftsmen leading to a cross-fertilisation of ideas and techniques. An example of this is the [[Melisende Psalter]], created by several hands in a workshop attached to the Holy Sepulchre. This style could have either reflected or influenced the taste of patrons of the arts. But what is seen is an increase in stylised Byzantine-influenced content. This even extended to the production of [[icons]], unknown at the time to the Franks, sometimes in a Frankish style and even of western saints. This is seen as the origin of Italian panel painting.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=147\u2013149}} While it is difficult to track illumination of manuscripts and castle design back to their sources, textual sources are simpler. The translations made in Antioch are notable, but they are considered of secondary importance to the works emanating from Muslim Spain and from the hybrid culture of Sicily.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=667\u2013668}}\n\n==Military==\n\nReports from John of Ibelin indicate that around 1170 the military force of the Kingdom of Jerusalem was based on a feudal host of about 647 to 675 heavily armoured knights. Each [[feudatory]] would also provide his own armed retainers. Non-noble light cavalry and infantry were known as ''serjants''. The prelates and the towns were to provide 5,025 ''serjants'' to the royal army, according to Ibelin's list. This force would be augmented by hired soldiery called [[Turcopoles]]. In times of emergency, the king could also call upon a general muster of the whole Christian population.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=134}}\n\nJoshua Prawer estimated that the military orders could match the king's fighting strength. This means the total military of the kingdom was approximately 1,200 knights and 10,000 ''serjants''. Enough for further territorial gains, but fewer than required to maintain military domination. This was also a problem defensively. Putting a major army into the field required draining castles and cities of able-bodied fighting men. In the case of a defeat, such as the [[Battle of Hattin]], there remained few to resist the invaders. Muslim armies were incohesive and seldom campaigned outside the period between sowing and harvest. As a result, the crusaders adopted delaying tactics when faced with a superior invading Muslim force. They would avoid direct confrontation, instead retreating to strongholds and waiting for the Muslim army to disperse. It took generations before the Muslims recognised that they could not conquer {{lang|fr|Outremer}} without destroying the Franks' fortresses. This strategic change forced the crusaders away from the tactic of gaining and holding territory, including Jerusalem. Instead their aim became to attack and destroy Egypt. By removing this constant regional challenge, the crusaders hoped to gain the necessary time to improve the kingdom's demographic weakness. Egypt was isolated from the other Islamic power centres, it would be easier to defend and was self-sufficient in food.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=327\u2013333, 340\u2013341}} \n\nLittle was achieved by a [[Fifth Crusade]], primarily raised from Hungary, Germany, Flanders and led by King [[Andrew II of Hungary]] and [[Leopold VI, Duke of Austria]]. The crusaders attacked Egypt to break the Muslim hold on Jerusalem. Damietta was [[Siege of Damietta (1218\u20131219)|captured]] but then returned and an eight-year truce agreed after the Franks advancing into Egypt surrendered.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=214\u2013218,236}} In 1249 [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] led a [[Seventh Crusade|crusade]] attacking Egypt, was defeated at the [[Battle of Al Mansurah]] and the crusaders were captured [[Battle of Fariskur|as they retreated]]. Louis and his nobles were ransomed, other prisoners were given a choice of conversion to Islam or beheading. A ten-year truce was established and Louis remained in Syria until 1254 consolidating the Frankish position.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=583\u2013607,615\u2013620}}{{sfn|Tyerman |2019|pp=276\u2013277}}\n\n==Language==\n\nThe Franks ruled as an elite and outnumbered class. As such, linguistic differences remained a key differentiator between the Franks lords and the local population. The Franks typically spoke [[Old French]] and wrote in [[Latin]]. While some learnt [[Arabic]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and [[Hebrew]] this was unusual.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=177}}\n\n==Legacy==\n\nRiley-Smith descibed the Latin [[kingdom of Jerusalem]] in the period between 1099 and 1187 as the first experiment in a \"Europe Overseas\". The raising, transportation, and supply of large armies led to flourishing [[Trade route|trade]] between Europe and the crusader states. The Italian city-states of Genoa and Venice flourished, through profitable trading communes.{{sfn|Housley|2006|pp=152\u2013154}}{{sfn|Davies|1997|pp=359\u2013360}} Many historians argue that the interaction between the western Christian and Islamic cultures played a significant, ultimately positive, part in the development of European civilisation and the [[Renaissance]].{{sfn|Nicholson|2004|p=96}} Relations between Europeans and the Islamic world, stretching across the length of the Mediterranean Sea, led to an improved perception of Islamic culture in the West. But this broad area of interaction also makes it difficult for historians to identify how much of this cultural cross-fertilisation originated in the crusader states and how much originated in Sicily and Spain.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=667\u2013668}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=20em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book|last=Asbridge|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Asbridge|title=The Crusades: The War for the Holy Land|year=2012 |publisher=Simon & Schuster|isbn=978-1-84983-688-3|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|title=[[Europe: A History]]|last=Davies|first=Norman|authorlink=Norman Davies|year=1997|publisher=[[Random House|Pimlico]]|isbn=978-0-7126-6633-6|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Findley| first=Carter Vaughan|year=2005|title=The Turks in World History|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-516770-2|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Hillenbrand|first=Carole|authorlink=Carole Hillenbrand|year=1999|title=The Crusades: Islamic Perspectives|publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]]|isbn=978-0-7486-0630-6|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uNkWAQAAIAAJ&q|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Holt|first=Peter Malcolm|authorlink=Peter Holt (historian)|title=The Crusader States and Their Neighbours, 1098-1291|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A0qLHVGgH7AC&pg=PA8|year=1986|publisher=Pearson Longman|isbn=                                                    978-0-58249-302-5}}\n* {{cite book|last=Housley|first=Norman|authorlink=Norman Housley|title=Contesting the Crusades|publisher=[[Blackwell Publishing]]|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4051-1189-8|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Mayer|first=Hans Eberhard|title=The Crusades|edition=&nbsp; Second|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1988|isbn=978-0-19-873097-2|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Jotischky|first=Andrew|title=Crusading and the Crusader States|publisher=[[Taylor & Francis]]|year=2004|isbn=978-0-582-41851-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rTUlDwAAQBAJ|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Nicholson|first=Helen|title=The Crusades|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|year=2004|isbn=978-0-313-32685-1|ref=harv|url=https://archive.org/details/crusades00nich}}\n* {{cite book|last=Prawer|first=Joshua|authorlink=Joshua Prawer|title=The Crusaders' Kingdom|publisher=[[Phoenix Books|Phoenix Press]]|year=1972|isbn=978-1-84212-224-2|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AMxmAAAAMAAJ&q|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Russell|first=Josiah C.|chapter=The Population of the Crusader States|pages=295\u2013314|editor-last1=Zacour|editor-first1=Norman P.|editor-last2=Hazard| editor-first2=Harry W.|title=A History of the Crusades|chapter-url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tgfMNfBIgSwC|volume=5 The Impact of the Crusades on the Near East|year=1985|publisher=The University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=0-299-09140-6|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Tyerman|first=Christopher|title=God's War: A New History of the Crusades|publisher=Belknap Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-674-02387-1|ref=harv|url=https://archive.org/details/godswarnewhistor00tyer}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Tyerman|first=Christopher|title=The World of the Crusades|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GIOVDwAAQBAJ|year=2019|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|isbn=978-0-300-21739-1}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* Andrew D Buck, \"[[doi:10.1093/ehr/ceaa008|Settlement, Identity, and Memory in the Latin East: An Examination of the Term \u2018Crusader States\u2019.]]\" ''The English Historical Review''\n* [[Jonathan Riley-Smith]], ''The Feudal Nobility and the Kingdom of Jerusalem, 1174\u20131277''.

They were]] established at the end of the 11th and the beginning of the 12th{{nbsp}}century as a consequence of the [[First Crusade]]. These states in the [[Levant]] were the first examples of \"Europe overseas\" and became known to historians by the [[French language|French]] version of the phrase, {{lang|fr|Outremer}}. A presence remained in the region in some form until the [[Siege of Acre (1291)|fall]] of [[Acre,_Israel|Acre]] in 1291 led to the rapid loss of the last remaining holdings. The crusade was proclaimed by [[Pope Urban II]] at the [[Council of Clermont]] in 1095. He encouraged military support for the [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Alexios I Komnenos|Alexios{{nbsp}}I]] against the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk]] Turks and an armed pilgrimage to Jerusalem. There was an enthusiastic response in [[Western Europe]] across all social strata. This, and later campaigns, established four crusader states in the [[Near East]]: the [[County of Edessa]]; the [[Principality of Antioch]]; the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]; and the [[County of Tripoli]]. \n\nThe crusader states were frontier societies with a minority Frankish populations ruling indigenous populations culturally related to the neighbouring communities. The states were politically and legally stratified with the Franks controlling the relationships between self-governing and ethnically-based communities. Society was divided between Frank and non-Frank, not between Christian and Muslim. Few Franks could speak more than basic Arabic, instead relying on indigenous interpreters and headmen. Indigenous  courts administered civil disputes and minor criminality with more serious offences dealt with by the Frankish {{lang|fr|cour des bourgeois}} or courts of the burgesses, the name of the non-noble Franks. There is little evidence of assimilation. The archaeology is culturally exclusive and written evidence indicates deep religious divisions. Large differences in status and wealth existed between urban and rural dwellers; indigenous Christians were able gain higher status and acquire wealth through commerce and industry in towns, but few Muslims lived in urban areas. Muslim and indigenous Christian populations tended to seperation rather than integration. Greek Orthodox communities proved resilient with many surviving the Arab conquest, rule by the Crusaders and for centuries after the fall of the crusader states. Other indigenous communities included Palestinian Christians, Arabic speaking members of the [[Jacobite Syrian Christian Church]] and [[Maronite Church]], [[Armenians]] as well well as [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]], [[Shia Islam|Shia]] and [[Druze]] Muslims. \n\nFew artistic styles originated in the crusader states. One that did was a military architecture that demonstrated a synthesis of the European, Byzantine and Muslim traditions; with the inclusion of oriental design features such as large water reservoirs and the exclusion of occidental features like moats.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=295\u2013296}} Early church design was in the [[French Romanesque architecture|French Romanesque]] style. The 12th-century rebuilding of the Holy Sepulchre retained some of the Byzantine details, but added new arches and chapels in northern French, Aquitanian and Proven\u00e7al styles. In sculpture little trace of an indigenous influence remains. In contrast the visual culture demonstrates the influence of indigenous artists. Decoration of shrines, painting and the production of manuscripts and the adoption of methods from the Byzantine and indigenous artists and iconographical practice. Monumental and panel painting, mosaics and illuminations in manuscripts adopted an indigenous style.

From the 8th century, in what later became known as the ''[[Reconquista]]'', Christians were campaigning in Spain. In the 11th century [[Normans|Norman]] adventurers led by [[Roger I of Sicily|Roger de Hauteville]], later King Roger I of Sicily, seized [[Emirate of Sicily|Sicily]] from the Muslims.{{sfn|Mayer|1988|pp=17\u201318}} The [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] Christian Byzantine Empire in the early 11th century stretched east to Iran and controlled Bulgaria and much of southern Italy in the west. However, from this point the arrival of new enemies on all frontiers placed intolerable strains on the resources of both the Byzantine Empire and the neighbouring Arab Muslim regimes.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=42\u201346}} The situation was a serious threat to the future of the Byzantine Empire. This made the possibility of western military aid from the Papacy for specific campaigns an attractive prospect to the Byzantines.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=46}}{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=27}}\n\nThere were three waves of [[Turkic migration]] into the Middle East. The initial phase began in the 9th{{nbsp}}century with the use use of captured Turkic nomads as slave soldiers by the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] dynasty rulers of Baghdad and others across the [[Middle East]]. These were known as [[ghulam]] or [[mamluk]]s. The [[steppe]] Turks skills in horsemanship and archery were particularly valued. It was expected that these slaves would remain loyal. However on conversion to Islam they were emancipated so there was no obstacle preventing these Turks progressing from roles as guards, as commanders, governors, dynastic founders and eventually king makers.{{sfn|Findley|2005|pp=65\u201368}} The result was Turkic dynasties in Egypt and Syria most notably the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] that destroyed the {{lang|fr|Outremer}} in the 13th{{nbsp}}century.{{sfn|Holt|1986|pp=6\u20137}} The second phase was led by a minor ruling clan of [[Oghuz Turks]] from [[Transoxania]] collectively known as [[Seljuk dynasty|Seljuks]] after the founder, [[Seljuk (warlord)|Salj\u016bq]]. This created a sizable ethnic Turkish presence. In the mid-11th{{nbsp}}century the Seljuks supplanted the [[Ghaznavids]] in [[Khurasan]], extending mastery through Khurasan and into [[Iran]] all the way to Baghdad. There the [[List of Abbasid caliphs|Abbasid caliph]] granted [[Tughril]] the title {{lang|ae|[[Sultan]]}}, ''power'' in [[arabic]], who was the first ruler to use this title on coinage. This ascent resulted in the [[Great Seljuk Empire]], {{sfn|Findley|2005|pp=68\u201369}} and the [[Seljuq dynasty|House of Seljuk]] assimilated into Perso-arabic culture. The Empire was not centralised or a coherent whole, rather a loose assemply of provinces with differing languages and nationalities. Traditinally these were ruled as a family concern rather than by a single monarch.{{sfn|Holt|1986|p=11}} \n\n[[File:Aftermath of Manzikert.png|left|upright=1.5|thumb|Battles between Byzantines and the Turks for the control of Anatolia in the 1070s.|left|alt=Map of the Mediterranean Sea with the extent of the Byzantine Empire highlighted]]The first two phases of Turkic migration involved the arrival of the Turks into Arab Islamic territory and not significantly impacting the culture. The third, into Anatolia, was different as it impacted {{lang|ar|Bil\u0101d al-R\u016bm}}, the ''land of the Romans'' i.e. the Byzantine Greeks ruling what remained of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. Prior to the arrival of the Turks the Byzantines were on the offensive. They captured Antioch after three centuries of Arab rule and invaded Syria. Turkish [[Ghazi (warrior)|Ghazi]] and their Byzantine equivalents, {{lang|grc|[[Akritai]]}}, often Turkish themselves, indulged in ephemeral cross border raiding until the Great Suljuk Sultan [[Alp Arslan]] interrupted campaigning in Egypt to sucure his northern borders and defeated Byzantine Emperor [[Romanos IV Diogenes]] at the [[Battle of Manzikert]].{{sfn|Holt|1986|pp=167\u2013168}} Historians once considered this a pivotal event but now Manzikert is regarded as only one step in the development of the [[Sultanate of Rum]].{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=27}} Alp Arslan had no ambition to expand into Anatolia but the resulting collapse in the authority of the Byzantine Empire allowed the ghazi and nomadic tribesmen seeking pasture for flocks and herds to flood into the now ungoverned lands. Alp Arslan's cousin [[Suleiman ibn Qutulmish]] exploited Byzantine factionalism and carved out a new realm in Anatolia, seizing [[Cilicia]] from an Armenian warlord in 1073 and peacefully entering Antioch in 1084. Eventually, he came into conflict with the Great Seljuk Empire and was defeated and killed in 1092.{{sfn|Holt|1986|p=168}} This formed part of a wider disintegration in the Middle East. In the same year the [[vizier]] and effective ruler of the Great Seljuk Empire, [[Nizam al-Mulk]] died closely followed by the Sultan [[Malik-Shah I|Malik-Shah]] and the Fatimid khalif, [[Al-Mustansir Billah]].

Palestinian Christians lived around Jerusalem and in an arc stretching from [[Jericho]] and [[Jordan River|the Jordan]] to [[Hebron]] in the south.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=131}} Comparing archaeological research on Byzantine churches built before the Muslim conquest and Ottoman census records from the 16th{{nbsp}}century demonstrates that some Greek Orthodox communities had disappeared before the crusades but most continued for centuries after the fall of the crusader states. [[Maronites]] were concentrated in Tripoli; Jacobites in Antioch and Edessa. Armenians were concentrated in the north but communities existed in all major towns. Palestine's central areas had a Muslim majority population. The Muslims were mainly Sunnis, but Shi'ite communities existed in [[Galilee]]. The nonconformist Muslim [[Druze]]s were recorded living in the mountains of Tripoli. The Jewish population resided in coastal towns and some Galilean villages.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=131\u2013132}}{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=49,51}}\n\nWith the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|capture of Jerusalem]] and [[Battle of Ascalon|victory at Ascalon]] the majority of the crusaders considered their [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] complete and returned to Europe.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=104\u2013106}} The Frankish population of the Kingdom of Jerusalem became concentrated in three major cities. By the 13th{{nbsp}}century the population of Acre probably exceeded 60,000, then came [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], with the capital being the smallest of the three with a population somewhere between 20,000 and 30,000.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|p=82}} At its zenith, the Latin population of the region reached {{circa|250,000}} with the Kingdom of Jerusalem's population numbering {{circa|120,000}} and the combined total in Tripoli, Antioch and Edessa being broadly comparable.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|p=396}} The presence of Frankish peasants is evident in 235 villages, out of a total of some 1,200 rural settlements.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=150}}\n\nIn context, Josiah Russell estimates the population of what he calls \"Islamic territory\" as roughly 12.5&nbsp;million in 1000{{mdash}}Anatolia 8 million, Syria 2 million, Egypt 1.5 million and North Africa 1 million {{mdash}} with the European areas that provided crusaders having a population of 23.7 million.

Russell acknowledges that much of Anatolia was Christian or under the Byzantines and that some purportedly Islamic areas such as Mosul and Baghdad had significant Christian populations.{{sfn|Russell|1985|p=298}}\n\n==Society==\n\n{{lang|fr|Outremer}} was frontier society with a Frankish elite ruling a indigenous population related to the neighbouring communities, many of whom were hostile to the Franks.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=17\u201319}} It was politically and legally stratified, with self-governing, ethnically-based communities. Relations between communities were controlled by the Franks.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|p=127}} The basic division in society was between Frank and non-Frank, and not between Christian and Muslim. All Franks were considered free men, while the indigenous peoples lived like western [[serfs]]. Conversion to Latin Christianity was their only route to full citizenship. The Franks imposed officials in order to use the military, legal and administrative systems to control the indigenous peoples. Few Franks could speak more than basic Arabic. [[Dragoman]]s{{mdash}}interpreters{{mdash}}and ''[[Rais|ru\u02beas\u0101\u02be]]''{{mdash}}village headmen{{mdash}}were used as mediators. Civil disputes and minor criminality were administered by the courts of the indigenous communities, but more serious offences and cases involving Franks were dealt with by the Frankish {{lang|fr|cour des bourgeois}} or courts of the burgesses, the name given to the non-noble Franks.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|p=81}} The lack of material evidence makes it difficult to identify the level of assimilation. The archaeology is culturally exclusive and written evidence indicates deep religious division, although some historians assume that {{lang|fr|Outremer}}'s heterogeneity eroded formal apartheid.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|pp=126\u2013136}} The key differentiator in status and economic position was between urban and rural dwellers. Indigenous Christians could gain higher status and acquire wealth through commerce and industry in towns, but few Muslims lived in urban areas except those in servitude.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=128\u2013130}}\n\nFrankish courts reflected the region's diversity. [[Melisende, Queen of Jerusalem|Queen Melisende]] was part Armenian and married Fulk from Anjou. Their son Amalric, first married a Frank from the Levant, then a Byzantine Greek. William of Tyre was appalled at the use of Jewish, Syrian and Muslim physicians, who were popular among the nobility. Greek and Arabic speaking Christians made Antioch a centre of cultural interchange. The indigenous peoples showed the Frankish nobility traditional deference. Some Franks adopted the their dress, food, housing and military techniques. This does not mean that {{lang|fr|Outremer}} was a cultural melting pot. Inter-communal relations were shallow, separate identities were maintained and other communities were considered alien.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|pp=127,131,136\u2013141}}\n\n==Economy==\n\nIn addition to being economic centres themselves, the crusader states provided an obstacle to Muslim trade by sea with the west and to the land routes from [[Mesopotamia]] and Syria to the great urban economies of the Nile. Despite hostility, commerce continued, coastal cities remained maritime outlets for the Islamic hinterland and eastern wares were exported to Europe in unprecedented volumes. The Byzantine-Muslim mercantile growth in the 12th{{nbsp}}and{{nbsp}}13th{{nbsp}}centuries may have occurred anyway, as the Western European economy was booming due to population growth; this increased wealth and created a growing social class demanding city centred products and eastern imports, but it is likely that the Crusades hastened the developments. European fleets were expanded, better ships built, navigation improved and fare paying pilgrims subsidised many voyages. Agricultural production, largely the domain of the indigenous population, flourished before the fall of the First Kingdom in 1187, but was negligible afterwards. Franks, Muslims, Jews and indigenous Christians traded crafts in the [[souks]], teeming oriental bazaars, of the cities.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|p=382}}  The Italian, Proven\u00e7al and Catalan merchants monopolised shipping, imports, exports, transportation and banking. The Frankish noble and ecclesiastical institutional income was based on income from estates, market tolls and taxation.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=352\u2013354}} The main centres of production were Antioch, Tripoli, Tyre and, less importantly, Beirut. Textiles, glass, dyestuffs, olives, wine, sesame oil and sugar were exported; silk was particularly prized.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=392\u2013393}} The Frankish population, estimated at roughly a quarter of a million people, provided an import market for clothing and finished goods.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=396\u2013397}}\n\n==Coinage==\n\n[[File:crusader coins of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|350px|Crusader coins of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.

Right: gold bezant with Christian symbol (1250s)]]\nThe Franks adopted the more monetised indigenous economic system, using a hybrid coinage: predominantly northern Italian and southern French silver European coins; Frankish variant copper coins minted in Arabic and Byzantine styles; and silver and gold [[dirham]]s and [[dinar]]s. After 1124, Egyptian dinars were copied, creating Jerusalem's gold [[bezant]]. Following the collapse of {{lang|fr|Outremer}} in 1187, trade, rather than agriculture, increasingly dominated the economy and western coins began dominating the coinage in circulation. Although lords in Tyre, Sidon and Beirut minted silver pennies and copper coins there is little evidence of systematic attempts to create a unified currency.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|pp=120\u2013121}}\n\n==Monarchy==\n\nDuring the period of near constant warfare in the early decades of the 12th{{nbsp}}century, the king of Jerusalem's foremost role was leader of the feudal host. They very rarely awarded land or lordships, and those awarded that became vacant\u2014a frequent event due to the high mortality rate in the conflict\u2014reverted to the crown. Instead their followers' loyalty was rewarded with city incomes. As a result, the royal domain of the first five rulers {{mdash}}including much of Judea, Samaria, the coast from Jaffa to Ascalon, the ports of Acre and Tyre, and other scattered castles and territories{{mdash}}was larger that the combined holdings of the nobility. This meant that the rulers of Jerusalem had greater internal power than comparative western monarchs, although they did not have the necessary administrative systems and personnel to govern such a large realm.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=104\u2013105}}\n\n[[File:Principado de Galileen.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|Map of the feudatories of the Kingdom of Jerusalem in 1187|alt=Map of the feudatories of the Kingdom of Jerusalem in 1187]]The situation evolved in the second quarter of the century with the establishment of baronial dynasties. Magnates{{mdash}}such as [[Raynald of Ch\u00e2tillon]], Lord of [[Oultrejordain]], and [[Raymond III, Count of Tripoli]], [[Principality of Galilee|Prince of Galilee]]{{mdash}}often acted as autonomous rulers. Royal powers were abrogated and effectively governance was undertaken within the feudatories. What central control remained was exercised at the {{lang|la|[[Haute Cour]]}}{{mdash}}High Court, in English. Only the 13th{{nbsp}}century [[jurists]] of Jerusalem used this term, {{lang|la|[[curia regis]]}} was more common in Europe. These were meetings between the king and his tenants in chief. Over time the duty of the vassal to give counsel developed into a privilege and ultimately the legitimacy of the monarch depended on the agreement of the court.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|p=112}} The barons of Jerusalem in the 13th{{nbsp}}century have been poorly regarded by both contemporary and modern commentators: James of Vitry was disgusted by their superficial rhetoric; the historian [[Jonathan Riley-Smith]] writes of their pedantry and the use of spurious legal justification for political action.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=226}}\n\nIn practice, the High Court consisted of the great barons and the king's direct vassals. In law a quorum was the king and three tenants in chief. The 1162 {{lang|fr|[[assise sur la ligece]]}} theoretically expanded the court's membership to all 600 or more fief-holders, making them all peers. All those who paid homage directly to the king were now members of the {{lang|la|Haute Cour}} of Jerusalem. They were joined by the heads of the military orders by the end of the 12th{{nbsp}}century, and the Italian communes in the 13th{{nbsp}}century.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=112\u2013117}} Before the defeat at Hattin in 1187 the laws developed by the court were documented as {{lang|fr|[[assises]]}} in ''Letters of the Holy Sepulchre''.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|p=122}} The entire body of written law was lost in the subsequent fall of Jerusalem. From this point the legal system was largely based on custom and the memory of the lost legislation. The renowned jurist [[Philip of Novara]] lamented \"We know [the laws] rather poorly, for they are known by hearsay and usage...and we think an assize is something we have seen as an assize...in the kingdom of Jerusalem [the barons] made much better use of the laws and acted on them more surely before the land was lost\". Thus a myth was created of an idyllic early 12th{{nbsp}}century legal system. The barons used this to reinterpret the {{lang|fr|assise sur la ligece}}, which Almalric I intended to strengthen the crown, to instead constrain the monarch, particularly with regards to the right of the monarch to remove feudal fiefs without trial. The concomitant loss of the vast majority of rural fiefs led to the barons becoming an urban mercantile class where knowledge of the law was a valuable, well-regarded skill and a career path to higher status.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=228}}\n\nThe leaders of the [[Third Crusade]] ignored the monarchy of Jerusalem; the kings of England and France agreed on the division of future conquests as if there was no need to take into account the nobility of the crusader states. The historian [[Joshua Prawer]] considered that the weakness of the crown of Jerusalem was demonstrated by the rapid offering of the throne to Conrad of Montferrat in 1190 and then [[Henry II, Count of Champagne]] in 1192.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=107\u2013108}} Emperor Frederick II married [[Isabella II of Jerusalem|Queen Isabella]] in 1225 and immediately claimed the throne of Jerusalem from her father, the King Regent, [[John of Brienne]]. In 1228 Isabella died after giving birth to a son, [[Conrad IV of Germany|Conrad]], who through his mother was now legally king of Jerusalem and Frederick's heir.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=563\u2013571}} From 1229 when Frederick II left the Holy Land to defend his Italian and German lands, monarchs were absent{{mdash}}Conrad from 1225 until 1254, his son [[Conradin]] until his execution by Charles of Anjou in 1268. Government in Jerusalem had developed in the opposite direction to monarchies in the west. St Louis, Emperor Frederick and Kind Edward I\u2014contemporary rulers of France, Germany and England respectively\u2014 were powerful, with centralised bureaucracies. Jerusalem had a royalty without power.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|p=104}} Magnates such as the [[House of Ibelin|Ibelins]] attempted to seize the regency, fighting for control with an Italian army led by Frederick's viceroy [[Richard Filangieri]] in the [[War of the Lombards]]. Tyre, the [[Knights Hospitaller|Hospitallers]], the [[Teutonic Knights]] and [[Republic of Pisa|Pisa]] supported Filangieri. In opposition were the Ibelins, Acre, the [[Knights Templar|Templars]] and Genoa. The rebels established a surragate commune, or parliament, for twelve years in Acre.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=229}} They prevailed in 1242 with the capture of Tyre and a succession of Ibelin and Cypriot regents followed.{{sfn|Tyerman |2019|p=268}} Centralised government collapsed while the nobility, military orders and Italian communes took the lead. Three Cypriot [[House of Lusignan|Lusignan]] kings succeeded without the financial or military resources to recover the lost territory. The title of king was even sold to Charles of Anjou, but although he gained power for a short while, he never visited the kingdom. The king of Cyprus fought at Acre until all hope was lost and then returned to his island realm.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=108\u2013109}} Cyprus survived the fall of the mainland crusader states and [[Peter I of Cyprus]] launched the [[Alexandrian Crusade|last crusade against Egypt]] that temporarily captured Alexandria in 1365.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|p=392}}\n\n==Religion==\n\nPartly a result of anti-Orthodox sentiment the early crusaders filled ecclesiastical positions in the Orthodox church left vacant with Franks, including the patriarchy of Jerusalem when [[Simeon II of Jerusalem|Simeon II]] died. The Greek Orthodox Church was considered part of the universal Church, which enabled the replacement of Orthodox bishops by Latin clerics in coastal towns. The first Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, [[Arnulf of Chocques]], ejected the Greek Orthodox monks from the Holy Sepulchre but relented when the miracle of Easter Fire failed in their absence. The appointment of Latin bishops had little effect on the Arabic-speaking Orthodox Christians because the previous bishops were also foreign, from the Byzantine Empire. The Latin bishops used Greeks as [[coadjutor bishop]]s to administer Syrians and Greeks left without higher clergy. In many villages Latin and Orthodox Christians shared a church. In exceptional political circumstances, Greeks replaced Latin patriarchs in Antioch. Orthodox monasteries were rebuilt and Orthodox monastic life revived.  This toleration continued despite an increasingly interventionist papal reaction demonstrated by [[Jacques de Vitry]], [[Latin Catholic Diocese of Acre|Bishop of Acre]]. The Armenians, Copts, Jacobites, Nestorians and Maronites had greater autonomy. As they were not in communion with Rome they could retain their own bishops without a conflict of authority. Around 1181 [[Aimery of Limoges]], Patriarch of Antioch, managed to bring the Maronites into communion with Rome, establishing a precedent for the [[Eastern Catholic Churches#Uniate|Uniate Churches]].{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=134\u2013143}}\n\nThat religion prevented assimilation is evidenced by the Franks' discriminatory laws against Jews and Muslims. They were banned from living in Jerusalem and sexual relations between Muslims and Christians were punished by mutilation. Some mosques were converted into Christian churches, but the Franks did not force Muslims to convert to Christianity. Frankish lords were particularly reluctant, because conversion would have ended the Muslim peasants' servile status. The Muslims were permitted to pray in public and their [[hajj|pilgrimages to Mecca]] continued.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=127\u2013129}} The [[Samaritans]]' annual Passover festival attracted visitors from beyond the kingdom's borders.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|pp=131\u2013132}}\n\n==Communes==\n\nLargely located in the ports of Acre, Tyre, Tripoli and Sidon, [[commune]]s of Italians, Proven\u00e7als and Catalans had distinct cultural characteristics and exerted significant political power. Separate from the Frankish nobles or burgesses, the communes were autonomous political entities closely linked to their towns of origin. This gave them the ability to monopolise foreign trade and almost all banking and shipping in {{lang|fr|Outremer}}. Their parent cities' naval support was essential for the crusader states. Every opportunity to extend trade privileges was taken. One example saw the Venetians receiving one-third of Tyre and its territories, and exemption from all taxes, after Venice participated in the successful [[Siege of Tyre (1124)|1124 siege of the city]]. Despite all efforts, the Syrian and Palestinian ports were unable to replace Alexandria and Constantinople as the primary centres of commerce in the region. Instead, the communes competed with the monarchs and each other to maintain economic advantage. Power derived from the support of the communards' home cities rather than their number, which never reached more than hundreds. Thus, by the middle of the 13th{{nbsp}}century, the rulers of the communes were barely required to recognise the authority of the crusaders and divided Acre into several fortified miniature republics.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=85\u201393}}{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=151\u2013152}}\n\n==Military orders==\n{{Main|Military order (religious society)}}\n[[Image:Baldwin II ceeding the Temple of Salomon to Ugo dei Pagani and Gaudefroy de Saint-Homer.jpg|thumb|13th-century miniature of [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem]] granting the captured [[Al Aqsa Mosque]] to [[Hugues de Payens]]|alt=13th-century miniature of King Baldwin II granting the captured Al Aqsa Mosque to Hugues de Payens]]\nThe crusaders' propensity to follow the customs of their Western European homelands meant that there were very few innovations developed from the culture in the crusader states. Three notable exceptions to this were the military orders, warfare and fortifications.{{sfn| Prawer|1972| p=252}} The Knights Hospitaller, formally the Order of Knights of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem, were founded in Jerusalem before the First Crusade but added a martial element to their ongoing medical functions to become a much larger military order.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=169}} In this way the knighthood entered the previously monastic and ecclesiastical sphere.{{sfn| Prawer|1972| p=253}}\n\nMilitary orders like the Knights Hospitaller and Knights Templar provided Latin Christendom's first professional armies in support of the Kingdom of Jerusalem and the other crusader states. The Templars, formally the Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and the Temple of Solomon, and their [[Al-Aqsa Mosque|Temple of Solomon]] were founded around 1119 by a small band of knights who dedicated themselves to protecting pilgrims en{{nbsp}}route to Jerusalem.{{sfn| Asbridge|2012| p= 168}} The Hospitallers and the Templars became supranational organisations as papal support led to rich donations of land and revenue across Europe. This, in turn, led to a steady flow of new recruits and the wealth to maintain multiple fortifications in the crusader states. In time, they developed into autonomous powers in the region.{{sfn| Asbridge|2012|pp=169\u2013170}} After the fall of Acre the Hospitallers first relocated to Cyprus, then conquered and ruled [[Rhodes]] (1309\u20131522) and Malta (1530\u20131798), and [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta|continue in existence to the present-day]]. King [[Philip IV of France]] probably had financial and political reasons to oppose the Knights Templar, which led to him exerting pressure on [[Pope Clement V]]. The pope responded in 1312, with a series of papal bulls including ''[[Vox in Excelso]]'' and ''[[Ad Providam]]'' that dissolved the order on the alleged and probably false grounds of sodomy, magic and heresy.{{sfn|Davies|1997|p=359}}\n\n==Art and architecture==\n{{Further|Art of the crusades|List of Crusader castles}}\n\n[[File:Crac des chevaliers syria.jpeg|thumb|12th-century [[Knights Hospitaller]] castle of [[Krak des Chevaliers]] in Syria, one of the first castles to use concentric fortification, i.e. concentric rings of defence that could all operate at the same time. It has two curtain walls and sits on a promontory.|alt=photograph of 12th-century Hospitaller castle of Krak des Chevaliers in Syria showing concentric rings of defence, curtain walls and location sitting on a promontory.]]According to Joshua Prawer no major European poet, theologian, scholar or historian settled in the crusader states. Some went on pilgrimage, and this is reflected in new imagery and ideas in western poetry. Although they did not migrate east themselves, their output often encouraged others to journey on pilgrimage to the east.{{sfn| Prawer|1972| p=468}}\n\nHistorians consider military architecture{{mdash}}demonstrating a synthesis of the European, Byzantine and Muslim traditions{{mdash}}the most original and impressive artistic achievement of the crusades. Castles were a tangible symbol of the dominance of a Latin Christian minority over a largely hostile majority population. They also acted as centres of administration.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=280\u2013281}} Modern historiography rejects the 19th-century consensus that Westerners learnt the basis of military architecture from the Near East, as Europe had already experienced rapid growth in defensive technology before the First Crusade. Direct contact with Arab fortifications originally constructed by the Byzantines did influence developments in the east. But the lack of documentary evidence means that it remains difficult to differentiate between the importance of this design culture and the constraints of situation, which led to the inclusion of oriental design features such as large water reservoirs and the exclusion of occidental features like moats.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=295\u2013296}}\n\nTypically, early church design was in the [[French Romanesque architecture|French Romanesque]] style. This can be seen in the 12th-century rebuilding of the Holy Sepulchre. It retained some of the earlier Byzantine details, but new arches and chapels were built to northern French, Aquitanian and Proven\u00e7al patterns. There is little trace of any surviving indigenous influence in sculpture, although in the Holy Sepulchre the [[Capital (architecture)|column capitals]] of the south facade follow classical Syrian patterns.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=146}}\n\nIn contrast to architecture and sculpture, it is in the area of visual culture that the assimilated nature of the society was demonstrated. Throughout the 12th and 13th centuries the influence of indigenous artists was demonstrated in the decoration of shrines, painting and the production of manuscripts. In addition, Frankish practitioners borrowed methods from the Byzantines and indigenous artists and iconographical practice. Monumental and panel painting, mosaics and illuminations in manuscripts adopted an indigenous style leading to a cultural synthesis illustrated by the [[Church of the Nativity]]. Wall mosaics were unknown in the west but in widespread use in the crusader states. Whether this was by indigenous craftsmen or learnt by Frankish ones is unknown, but a distinctive and original artistic style evolved.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=145\u2013146}}\n\nManuscripts were produced and illustrated in workshops housing Italian, French, English and indigenous craftsmen leading to a cross-fertilisation of ideas and techniques. An example of this is the [[Melisende Psalter]], created by several hands in a workshop attached to the Holy Sepulchre. This style could have either reflected or influenced the taste of patrons of the arts. But what is seen is an increase in stylised Byzantine-influenced content. This even extended to the production of [[icons]], unknown at the time to the Franks, sometimes in a Frankish style and even of western saints. This is seen as the origin of Italian panel painting.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=147\u2013149}} While it is difficult to track illumination of manuscripts and castle design back to their sources, textual sources are simpler. The translations made in Antioch are notable, but they are considered of secondary importance to the works emanating from Muslim Spain and from the hybrid culture of Sicily.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=667\u2013668}}\n\n==Military==\n\nReports from John of Ibelin indicate that around 1170 the military force of the Kingdom of Jerusalem was based on a feudal host of about 647 to 675 heavily armoured knights. Each [[feudatory]] would also provide his own armed retainers. Non-noble light cavalry and infantry were known as ''serjants''. The prelates and the towns were to provide 5,025 ''serjants'' to the royal army, according to Ibelin's list. This force would be augmented by hired soldiery called [[Turcopoles]]. In times of emergency, the king could also call upon a general muster of the whole Christian population.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=134}}\n\nJoshua Prawer estimated that the military orders could match the king's fighting strength. This means the total military of the kingdom was approximately 1,200 knights and 10,000 ''serjants''. Enough for further territorial gains, but fewer than required to maintain military domination. This was also a problem defensively. Putting a major army into the field required draining castles and cities of able-bodied fighting men. In the case of a defeat, such as the [[Battle of Hattin]], there remained few to resist the invaders. Muslim armies were incohesive and seldom campaigned outside the period between sowing and harvest. As a result, the crusaders adopted delaying tactics when faced with a superior invading Muslim force. They would avoid direct confrontation, instead retreating to strongholds and waiting for the Muslim army to disperse. It took generations before the Muslims recognised that they could not conquer {{lang|fr|Outremer}} without destroying the Franks' fortresses. This strategic change forced the crusaders away from the tactic of gaining and holding territory, including Jerusalem. Instead their aim became to attack and destroy Egypt. By removing this constant regional challenge, the crusaders hoped to gain the necessary time to improve the kingdom's demographic weakness. Egypt was isolated from the other Islamic power centres, it would be easier to defend and was self-sufficient in food.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=327\u2013333, 340\u2013341}} \n\nLittle was achieved by a [[Fifth Crusade]], primarily raised from Hungary, Germany, Flanders and led by King [[Andrew II of Hungary]] and [[Leopold VI, Duke of Austria]]. The crusaders attacked Egypt to break the Muslim hold on Jerusalem. Damietta was [[Siege of Damietta (1218\u20131219)|captured]] but then returned and an eight-year truce agreed after the Franks advancing into Egypt surrendered.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=214\u2013218,236}} In 1249 [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] led a [[Seventh Crusade|crusade]] attacking Egypt, was defeated at the [[Battle of Al Mansurah]] and the crusaders were captured [[Battle of Fariskur|as they retreated]]. Louis and his nobles were ransomed, other prisoners were given a choice of conversion to Islam or beheading. A ten-year truce was established and Louis remained in Syria until 1254 consolidating the Frankish position.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=583\u2013607,615\u2013620}}{{sfn|Tyerman |2019|pp=276\u2013277}}\n\n==Language==\n\nThe Franks ruled as an elite and outnumbered class. As such, linguistic differences remained a key differentiator between the Franks lords and the local population. The Franks typically spoke [[Old French]] and wrote in [[Latin]]. While some learnt [[Arabic]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and [[Hebrew]] this was unusual.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=177}}\n\n==Legacy==\n\nRiley-Smith descibed the Latin [[kingdom of Jerusalem]] in the period between 1099 and 1187 as the first experiment in a \"Europe Overseas\". The raising, transportation, and supply of large armies led to flourishing [[Trade route|trade]] between Europe and the crusader states. The Italian city-states of Genoa and Venice flourished, through profitable trading communes.{{sfn|Housley|2006|pp=152\u2013154}}{{sfn|Davies|1997|pp=359\u2013360}} Many historians argue that the interaction between the western Christian and Islamic cultures played a significant, ultimately positive, part in the development of European civilisation and the [[Renaissance]].{{sfn|Nicholson|2004|p=96}} Relations between Europeans and the Islamic world, stretching across the length of the Mediterranean Sea, led to an improved perception of Islamic culture in the West. But this broad area of interaction also makes it difficult for historians to identify how much of this cultural cross-fertilisation originated in the crusader states and how much originated in Sicily and Spain.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=667\u2013668}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=20em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book|last=Asbridge|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Asbridge|title=The Crusades: The War for the Holy Land|year=2012 |publisher=Simon & Schuster|isbn=978-1-84983-688-3|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|title=[[Europe: A History]]|last=Davies|first=Norman|authorlink=Norman Davies|year=1997|publisher=[[Random House|Pimlico]]|isbn=978-0-7126-6633-6|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Findley| first=Carter Vaughan|year=2005|title=The Turks in World History|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-516770-2|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Hillenbrand|first=Carole|authorlink=Carole Hillenbrand|year=1999|title=The Crusades: Islamic Perspectives|publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]]|isbn=978-0-7486-0630-6|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uNkWAQAAIAAJ&q|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Holt|first=Peter Malcolm|authorlink=Peter Holt (historian)|title=The Crusader States and Their Neighbours, 1098-1291|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A0qLHVGgH7AC&pg=PA8|year=1986|publisher=Pearson Longman|isbn=0-582-49302-1}}\n* {{cite book|last=Housley|first=Norman|authorlink=Norman Housley|title=Contesting the Crusades|publisher=[[Blackwell Publishing]]|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4051-1189-8|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Mayer|first=Hans Eberhard|title=The Crusades|edition=&nbsp; Second|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1988|isbn=978-0-19-873097-2|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Jotischky|first=Andrew|title=Crusading and the Crusader States|publisher=[[Taylor & Francis]]|year=2004|isbn=978-0-582-41851-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rTUlDwAAQBAJ|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Nicholson|first=Helen|title=The Crusades|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|year=2004|isbn=978-0-313-32685-1|ref=harv|url=https://archive.org/details/crusades00nich}}\n* {{cite book|last=Prawer|first=Joshua|authorlink=Joshua Prawer|title=The Crusaders' Kingdom|publisher=[[Phoenix Books|Phoenix Press]]|year=1972|isbn=978-1-84212-224-2|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AMxmAAAAMAAJ&q|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Russell|first=Josiah C.|chapter=The Population of the Crusader States|pages=295\u2013314|editor-last1=Zacour|editor-first1=Norman P.|editor-last2=Hazard| editor-first2=Harry W.|title=A History of the Crusades|chapter-url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tgfMNfBIgSwC|volume=5 The Impact of the Crusades on the Near East|year=1985|publisher=The University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=0-299-09140-6|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Tyerman|first=Christopher|title=God's War: A New History of the Crusades|publisher=Belknap Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-674-02387-1|ref=harv|url=https://archive.org/details/godswarnewhistor00tyer}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Tyerman|first=Christopher|title=The World of the Crusades|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GIOVDwAAQBAJ|year=2019|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|isbn=978-0-300-21739-1}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* Andrew D Buck, \"[[doi:10.1093/ehr/ceaa008|Settlement, Identity, and Memory in the Latin East: An Examination of the Term \u2018Crusader States\u2019.]]\" ''The English Historical Review''\n* [[Jonathan Riley-Smith]], ''The Feudal Nobility and the Kingdom of Jerusalem, 1174\u20131277''.

Founded by [[Stewart Brand]] and [[Larry Brilliant]] in 1985, [[The WELL]] (Whole Earth \u2018Lectronic\u2019 Link) had over 5,000 members by 1990. They gathered and conversed electronically around 270 different topic areas in what became known as a \u201cvirtual community.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |last=Pernick|first=Ron|date=February 1, 1994|title=A Timeline of the First Ten Years of The WELL|publisher=Information Today}}</ref> Katz acquired The WELL in 1994,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Markoff|first1=John|title=COMPANY NEWS; Influential Computer Service Sold|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/04/business/company-news-influential-computer-service-sold.html|accessdate=27 July 2014|publisher=New York Times|date=January 4, 1994}}</ref> and, when the Internet began to emerge from the early ARPA net, he moved to connect it to the early network, enabling users to log in from anywhere and access anything on the Net, not just The WELL\u2019s discussion lists and servers. According to Smart Computing Encyclopedia, The WELL was \u201cone of the first major, worldwide online communities available on the Internet.\u201d Around the same time, Katz also created a new company called Whole Earth Networks, one of the largest regional Internet service providers, that provided dial-up Internet access with a suite of tools, including e-mail and the new Mosaic web browser.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=99289&privcapId=99273|title=Bruce R.

Well Engaged has served Washingtonpost.com, Fox Entertainment, Ziff-Davis Media, E-Trade, Tribune Interactive, About.com, Business Week, Major League Baseball, and other leading Internet news and commerce sites.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.econtentmag.com/Articles/Editorial/Feature/The-Three-Rs-of-Site-Success-Repeat-Visits-Retention-and-Revenues-812.htm|title=The Three Rs of Site Success: Repeat Visits, Retention, and Revenues|last1=Ambrozek|first1=Jenny|last2=Bundesen|first2=Lynne|date=September 1, 2002|website=EContentMag.com|publisher=EContent Mag|access-date=January 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Philanthropy and Board Service==\n\nKatz joined with his friends Mel and Patricia Ziegler and Bill Rosensweig to help create [[The Republic of Tea]] in 1992.
