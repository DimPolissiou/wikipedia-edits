Radiologists and medical physicists wanted to use the images for dose-planning for [[radiation therapy]]. ACR and NEMA joined forces and formed a standard committee in 1983. Their first standard, ACR/NEMA 300, entitled \"Digital Imaging and Communications\", was released in 1985. Very soon after its release, it became clear that improvements were needed. The text was vague and had internal contradictions.\n\nIn 1988 the second version was released. This version gained more acceptance among vendors. The image transmission was specified as over a dedicated 2 pair cable ([[EIA-485]]). The first demonstration of ACR/NEMA V2.0 interconnectivity technology was held at Georgetown University, May 21\u201323, 1990.  Six companies participated in this event, DeJarnette Research Systems, General Electric Medical Systems, Merge Technologies, Siemens Medical Systems, Vortech (acquired by Kodak that same year) and 3M.  Commercial equipment supporting ACR/NEMA 2.0 was presented at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) in 1990 by these same vendors.  Many soon realized that the second version also needed improvement. Several extensions to ACR/NEMA 2.0 were created, like Papyrus (developed by the University Hospital of Geneva, Switzerland) and SPI (Standard Product Interconnect), driven by Siemens Medical Systems and Philips Medical Systems.\n\nThe first large-scale deployment of ACR/NEMA technology was made in 1992 by the US Army and Air Force, as part of the MDIS (Medical Diagnostic Imaging Support)<ref>{{Cite journal |pmid = 7612705|year = 1995|last1 = Smith|first1 = D.

Loral Aerospace and Siemens Medical Systems led a consortium of companies in deploying the first US military [[Picture archiving and communication system|PACS]] (Picture Archiving and Communications System) at all major Army and Air Force medical treatment facilities and teleradiology nodes at a large number of US military clinics. DeJarnette Research Systems and Merge Technologies provided the modality gateway interfaces from third party imaging modalities to the Siemens SPI network.  The Veterans Administration and the Navy also purchased systems from this contract.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nIn 1993 the third version of the standard was released. Its name was then changed to \"Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine\", abbreviated DICOM. New service classes were defined, network support added and the Conformance Statement was introduced. Initially the DICOM standard was referred to as \"DICOM 3.0\" to distinguish it from its predecessors.<ref>{{Cite journal|year = 1992|last=Best|first=DE|title=Update of the ACR-NEMA digital imaging and communications in medicine standard|doi=10.1117/12.60322}}</ref> DICOM has been constantly updated and extended since 1993, with the intent that changes are backward compatible, except in rare cases where the earlier specification was incorrect or ambiguous. Officially there is no \"version\" of the standard except the current standard, hence the \"3.0\" version number is no longer used. There are no \"minor\" versions to the standard (e.g., no such thing as \"DICOM 3.1\") and there are no current plans to develop a new, incompatible, version of the standard (i.e., no \"DICOM 4.0\"). The standard should be referenced without specification of the date of release of a particular published edition,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part01/chapter_7.html|title=DICOM PS3.1 - Introduction and Overview - Referencing The DICOM Standard}}</ref> except when specific conformance requirements are invoked that depend on a retired feature that is no longer documented in the current standard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part01/sect_1.4.2.html|title=DICOM PS3.1 - Introduction and Overview - Continuous Maintenance}}</ref>\n\nWhile the DICOM standard has achieved a near universal level of acceptance amongst medical imaging equipment vendors and healthcare IT organizations, the standard has its limitations.  DICOM is a standard directed at addressing technical interoperability issues in medical imaging.  It is not a framework or architecture for achieving a useful clinical workflow.  The [[Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise|Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE)]] initiative layered on top of DICOM (and [[HL7|HL-7]]) defines profiles to select features from these standards to implement transactions for specific medical imaging interoperability use cases.\n\nThough always Internet compatible and based on transport over [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]], over time there has been an increasing need to support port 80 [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] transport to make use easier within the web browser. Most recently, a family of DICOM [[Representational state transfer|REST]]ful web services have been defined to allow mobile device friendly access to DICOM objects and services, which include WADO-RS, STOW-RS and QIDO-RS, which together constitute the [[DICOMweb]] initiative.\n\n=== Derivations ===\n\nThere are some derivations from the DICOM standard into other application areas. These include DICONDE (''Digital Imaging and Communication in Nondestructive Evaluation'') that was established in 2004 as a way for [[nondestructive testing]] manufacturers and users to share image data,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.astm.org/SNEWS/OCTOBER_2003/voelker_oct03.html|title=ASTM DICONDE Standard|website=www.astm.org}}</ref> and DICOS (''Digital Imaging and Communication in Security'') that was established in 2009 to be used for image sharing in [[airport security]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nema.org/prod/security/indust-Img.cfm|title=http://www.nema.org: Industrial Imaging and Communications Section|access-date=2010-02-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100515113502/http://www.nema.org/prod/security/indust-Img.cfm|archive-date=2010-05-15|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Data format ==\nDICOM groups information into [[data set]]s. For example, a file of a chest x-ray image may contain the patient ID within the file, so that the image can never be separated from this information by mistake. This is similar to the way that image formats such as [[JPEG]] can also have [[Exchangeable image file format|embedded tags]] to identify and otherwise describe the image.\n\nA DICOM data object consists of a number of attributes, including items such as name, ID, etc., and also one special attribute containing the image pixel data (i.e. logically, the main object has no \"header\" as such, being merely a list of attributes, including the pixel data). A single DICOM object can have only one attribute containing pixel data. For many modalities, this corresponds to a single image. However, the attribute may contain multiple \"frames\", allowing storage of cine loops or other multi-frame data. Another example is NM data, where an NM image, by definition, is a multi-dimensional multi-frame image. In these cases, three- or four-dimensional data can be encapsulated in a single DICOM object. Pixel data can be compressed using a variety of standards, including [[JPEG]], [[lossless JPEG]], [[JPEG 2000]], and [[Run-length encoding|run-length encoding (RLE)]]. [[Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Welch|LZW]] (zip) compression can be used for the whole data set (not just the pixel data), but this has rarely been implemented.\n\nDICOM uses three different data element encoding schemes. With explicit value representation (VR) data elements, for VRs that are not OB, OW, OF, SQ, UT, or UN, the format for each data element is: GROUP (2 bytes) ELEMENT (2 bytes) VR (2 bytes) LengthInByte (2 bytes) Data (variable length). For the other explicit data elements or implicit data elements, see section 7.1 of Part 5 of the DICOM Standard.\n\nThe same basic format is used for all applications, including network and file usage, but when written to a file, usually a true \"header\" (containing copies of a few key attributes and details of the application which wrote it) is added.\n\n== Image display ==\nTo promote identical grayscale image display on different monitors and consistent hard-copy images from various printers, the DICOM committee developed a lookup table to display digitally assigned pixel values. To use the '''DICOM grayscale standard display function (GSDF)''',<ref>http://medical.nema.org/Dicom/2011/11_14pu.pdf</ref> images must be viewed (or printed) on devices that have this lookup curve or on devices that have been calibrated to the GSDF curve.<ref>Shiroma, J. T. (2006). An introduction to DICOM. Veterinary Medicine, 19-20. http://search.proquest.com/docview/195482647</ref>\n\n== Value representations ==\nIn addition to a value representation, each attribute also has a ''value multiplicity'' to indicate the number of data elements contained in the attribute. For character string value representations, if more than one data element is being encoded, the successive data elements are separated by the backslash character \"\\\".<ref>See [http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part05/sect_6.2.html#table_6.2-1 Table 6.2-1 of PS 3.5]</ref>\n\n== Services ==\nDICOM consists of services, most of which involve transmission of data over a network. The file format for offline media is a later addition to the standard.\n\n=== Store ===\nThe DICOM Store service is used to send images or other persistent objects (structured reports, etc.) to a [[picture archiving and communication system]] (PACS) or workstation.\n\n=== Storage commitment ===\nThe DICOM storage commitment service is used to confirm that an image has been permanently stored by a device (either on redundant disks or on backup media, e.g. burnt to a CD).  The Service Class User (SCU: similar to a [[Client\u2013server model|client]]), a modality or workstation, etc., uses the confirmation from the Service Class Provider (SCP: similar to a [[Client\u2013server model|server]]), an archive station for instance, to make sure that it is safe to delete the images locally.\n\n=== Query/retrieve ===\nThis enables a workstation to find lists of images or other such objects and then retrieve them from a picture archiving and communication system.\n\n=== Modality worklist ===\nThe DICOM modality worklist service provides a list of imaging procedures that have been scheduled for performance by an image acquisition device (sometimes referred to as a modality system).  The items in the worklist include relevant details about the subject of the procedure (patient ID, name, sex, and age), the type of procedure (equipment type, procedure description, procedure code) and the procedure order (referring physician, [[Accession number (bioinformatics)|accession number,]] reason for exam). An image acquisition device, such as a CT scanner, queries a service provider, such as a [[Radiological information system|RIS]], to get this information which is then presented to the system operator and is used by the imaging device to populate details in the image metadata.\n\nPrior to the use of the DICOM modality worklist service, the scanner operator was required to manually enter all the relevant details. Manual entry is slower and introduces the risk of misspelled patient names, and other data entry errors.\n\n=== Modality performed procedure step ===\nA complementary service to modality worklist, this enables the modality to send a report about a performed examination including data about the images acquired, beginning time, end time, and duration of a study, dose delivered, etc.\nIt helps give the radiology department a more precise handle on resource (acquisition station) use. Also known as MPPS, this service allows a modality to better coordinate with image storage servers by giving the server a list of objects to send before or while actually sending such objects.\n\n=== Print ===\nThe DICOM print service is used to send images to a DICOM printer, normally to print an \"X-Ray\" film. There is a standard calibration (defined in DICOM Part 14) to help ensure consistency between various display devices, including hard copy printout.\n\n=== Off-line media (files) ===\nThe format for off-line media files is specified in Part 10 of the DICOM Standard. Such files are sometimes referred to as \"Part 10 files\".\n\nDICOM restricts the filenames on DICOM media to 8 characters (some systems wrongly use 8.3, but this does not conform to the standard). No information must be extracted from these names (PS3.10 Section 6.2.3.2). This is a common source of problems with media created by developers who did not read the specifications carefully.  This is a historical requirement to maintain compatibility with older existing systems. It also mandates the presence of a media directory, the DICOMDIR file, which provides index and summary information for all the DICOM files on the media. The DICOMDIR information provides substantially greater information about each file than any filename could, so there is less need for meaningful file names.\n\nDICOM files typically have a .dcm file extension if they are not part of a DICOM media (which requires them to be without extension).\n\nThe [[MIME]] type for DICOM files is defined by RFC 3240 as application/dicom.\n\nThe [[Uniform Type Identifier]] type for DICOM files is org.nema.dicom.\n\nThere is also an ongoing media exchange test and \"connectathon\" process for CD media and network operation that is organized by the [[Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise|IHE]] organization.\n\n== Application areas ==\nThe core application of the DICOM standard is to capture, store and distribute medical images.  The standard also provides services related to imaging such as managing imaging procedure worklists, printing images on film or digital media like DVDs, reporting procedure status like completion of an imaging acquisition, confirming successful archiving of images, encrypting datasets, removing patient identifying information from datasets, organizing layouts of images for review, saving image manipulations and annotations, calibrating image displays, encoding ECGs, encoding CAD results, encoding structured measurement data, and storing acquisition protocols.\n\n=== Types of equipment ===\nThe DICOM information object definitions<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part03/PS3.3.html | title=PS3.3}}</ref> encode the data produced by a wide variety of imaging device types,<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part03/sect_C.7.3.html#sect_C.7.3.1.1.1 | title=C.7.3 Common Series IE Modules}}</ref> including,  [[CT scan|CT]] (computed tomography),  [[MRI]] (magnetic resonance imaging), [[ultrasound]], [[X-ray]], [[fluoroscopy]], [[angiography]], [[mammography]],  breast tomosynthesis, PET ([[positron emission tomography]]), [[SPECT]] (single photon emission computed tomography),  Endoscopy, microscopy,  nd whole slide imaging, OCT (optical coherence tomography).\n\nDICOM is also implemented by devices associated with images or imaging workflow including, [[Picture archiving and communication system|PACS]] (picture archiving and communication systems), image viewers and display stations, CAD (computer-aided detection/diagnosis systems), 3D visualization systems, clinical analysis applications, image printers, Film scanners, media burners (that export DICOM files onto CDs, DVDs, etc.), media importers (that import DICOM files from CDs, DVDs, USBs, etc.), [[Radiological information system|RIS]] (radiology information systems), VNA (vendor-neutral archives), EMR (electronic medical record) systems, and radiology reporting systems\n\n=== Fields of medicine ===\nMany fields of medicine have a dedicated Working Group within DICOM,<ref>[http://dicom.nema.org/dicom/geninfo/Strategy.pdf DICOM Strategy Document]</ref> and DICOM is applicable to any field of medicine in which imaging is prevalent, including:, radiology, cardiology, oncology, nuclear medicine, radiotherapy, neurology, orthopedics, obstetrics, gynecology, ophthalmology, dentistry, maxillofacial surgery, dermatology, pathology, clinical trials, veterinary medicine, and medical/clinical photography\n\n== Port numbers over IP ==\n\nDICOM have reserved the following [[TCP and UDP port]] numbers by the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA): 104 [[well-known port]] for DICOM over [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) or [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP). Since 104 is in the reserved subset, many operating systems require special privileges to use it;\n2761 [[registered port]] for DICOM using [[Integrated Secure Communication Layer]] (ISCL) over TCP or UDP;\n2762 registered port for DICOM using [[Transport Layer Security]] (TLS) over TCP or UDP;\n11112 registered port for DICOM using standard, open communication over TCP or UDP.\nThe standard recommends but does not require the use of these port numbers.\n\n== Disadvantages==\nAccording to a paper presented at an international symposium in 2008, the DICOM standard has problems related to data entry. \"A major disadvantage of the DICOM Standard is the possibility for entering probably too many optional fields. This disadvantage is mostly showing in inconsistency of filling all the fields with the data. Some image objects are often incomplete because some fields are left blank and some are filled with incorrect data.\"<ref>{{cite conference |url=http://www.vcl.fer.hr/papers_pdf/Overview%20of%20the%20DICOM%20Standard.pdf |first1=Mario |last1=Mustra |first2=Kresimir |last2=Delac |first3=Mislav |last3=Grgic |date=September 2008 |title=Overview of the DICOM Standard |conference=ELMAR, 2008. 50th International Symposium |location=Zadar, Croatia |isbn=978-1-4244-3364-3 |pages=39\u201344}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, the file format admits executable code and may contain [[malware]].<ref>{{ cite web | url = https://labs.cylera.com/2019/04/16/pe-dicom-medical-malware/ | title = HIPAA-Protected Malware?

Radiologists and medical physicists wanted to use the images for dose-planning for [[radiation therapy]]. ACR and NEMA joined forces and formed a standard committee in 1983. Their first standard, ACR/NEMA 300, entitled \"Digital Imaging and Communications\", was released in 1985. Very soon after its release, it became clear that improvements were needed. The text was vague and had internal contradictions.\n\nIn 1988 the second version was released. This version gained more acceptance among vendors. The image transmission was specified as over a dedicated 2 pair cable ([[EIA-485]]). The first demonstration of ACR/NEMA V2.0 interconnectivity technology was held at Georgetown University, May 21\u201323, 1990.  Six companies participated in this event, DeJarnette Research Systems, General Electric Medical Systems, Merge Technologies, Siemens Medical Systems, Vortech (acquired by Kodak that same year) and 3M.  Commercial equipment supporting ACR/NEMA 2.0 was presented at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) in 1990 by these same vendors.  Many soon realized that the second version also needed improvement. Several extensions to ACR/NEMA 2.0 were created, like Papyrus (developed by the University Hospital of Geneva, Switzerland) and SPI (Standard Product Interconnect), driven by Siemens Medical Systems and Philips Medical Systems.\n\nThe first large-scale deployment of ACR/NEMA technology was made in 1992 by the US Army and Air Force, as part of the MDIS (Medical Diagnostic Imaging Support)<ref>{{Cite journal |pmid = 7612705|year = 1995|last1 = Smith|first1 = D.

Loral Aerospace and Siemens Medical Systems led a consortium of companies in deploying the first US military [[Picture archiving and communication system|PACS]] (Picture Archiving and Communications System) at all major Army and Air Force medical treatment facilities and teleradiology nodes at a large number of US military clinics. DeJarnette Research Systems and Merge Technologies provided the modality gateway interfaces from third party imaging modalities to the Siemens SPI network.  The Veterans Administration and the Navy also purchased systems from this contract.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nIn 1993 the third version of the standard was released. Its name was then changed to \"Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine\", abbreviated DICOM. New service classes were defined, network support added and the Conformance Statement was introduced. Initially the DICOM standard was referred to as \"DICOM 3.0\" to distinguish it from its predecessors.<ref>{{Cite journal|year = 1992|last=Best|first=DE|title=Update of the ACR-NEMA digital imaging and communications in medicine standard|doi=10.1117/12.60322}}</ref> DICOM has been constantly updated and extended since 1993, with the intent that changes are backward compatible, except in rare cases where the earlier specification was incorrect or ambiguous. Officially there is no \"version\" of the standard except the current standard, hence the \"3.0\" version number is no longer used. There are no \"minor\" versions to the standard (e.g., no such thing as \"DICOM 3.1\") and there are no current plans to develop a new, incompatible, version of the standard (i.e., no \"DICOM 4.0\"). The standard should be referenced without specification of the date of release of a particular published edition,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part01/chapter_7.html|title=DICOM PS3.1 - Introduction and Overview - Referencing The DICOM Standard}}</ref> except when specific conformance requirements are invoked that depend on a retired feature that is no longer documented in the current standard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part01/sect_1.4.2.html|title=DICOM PS3.1 - Introduction and Overview - Continuous Maintenance}}</ref>\n\nWhile the DICOM standard has achieved a near universal level of acceptance amongst medical imaging equipment vendors and healthcare IT organizations, the standard has its limitations.  DICOM is a standard directed at addressing technical interoperability issues in medical imaging.  It is not a framework or architecture for achieving a useful clinical workflow.  The [[Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise|Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE)]] initiative layered on top of DICOM (and [[HL7|HL-7]]) defines profiles to select features from these standards to implement transactions for specific medical imaging interoperability use cases.\n\nThough always Internet compatible and based on transport over [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]], over time there has been an increasing need to support port 80 [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] transport to make use easier within the web browser. Most recently, a family of DICOM [[Representational state transfer|REST]]ful web services have been defined to allow mobile device friendly access to DICOM objects and services, which include WADO-RS, STOW-RS and QIDO-RS, which together constitute the [[DICOMweb]] initiative.\n\n=== Derivations ===\n\nThere are some derivations from the DICOM standard into other application areas. These include DICONDE (''Digital Imaging and Communication in Nondestructive Evaluation'') that was established in 2004 as a way for [[nondestructive testing]] manufacturers and users to share image data,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.astm.org/SNEWS/OCTOBER_2003/voelker_oct03.html|title=ASTM DICONDE Standard|website=www.astm.org}}</ref> and DICOS (''Digital Imaging and Communication in Security'') that was established in 2009 to be used for image sharing in [[airport security]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nema.org/prod/security/indust-Img.cfm|title=http://www.nema.org: Industrial Imaging and Communications Section|access-date=2010-02-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100515113502/http://www.nema.org/prod/security/indust-Img.cfm|archive-date=2010-05-15|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Data format ==\nDICOM groups information into [[data set]]s. For example, a file of a chest x-ray image may contain the patient ID within the file, so that the image can never be separated from this information by mistake. This is similar to the way that image formats such as [[JPEG]] can also have [[Exchangeable image file format|embedded tags]] to identify and otherwise describe the image.\n\nA DICOM data object consists of a number of attributes, including items such as name, ID, etc., and also one special attribute containing the image pixel data (i.e. logically, the main object has no \"header\" as such, being merely a list of attributes, including the pixel data). A single DICOM object can have only one attribute containing pixel data. For many modalities, this corresponds to a single image. However, the attribute may contain multiple \"frames\", allowing storage of cine loops or other multi-frame data. Another example is NM data, where an NM image, by definition, is a multi-dimensional multi-frame image. In these cases, three- or four-dimensional data can be encapsulated in a single DICOM object. Pixel data can be compressed using a variety of standards, including [[JPEG]], [[lossless JPEG]], [[JPEG 2000]], and [[Run-length encoding|run-length encoding (RLE)]]. [[Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Welch|LZW]] (zip) compression can be used for the whole data set (not just the pixel data), but this has rarely been implemented.\n\nDICOM uses three different data element encoding schemes. With explicit value representation (VR) data elements, for VRs that are not OB, OW, OF, SQ, UT, or UN, the format for each data element is: GROUP (2 bytes) ELEMENT (2 bytes) VR (2 bytes) LengthInByte (2 bytes) Data (variable length). For the other explicit data elements or implicit data elements, see section 7.1 of Part 5 of the DICOM Standard.\n\nThe same basic format is used for all applications, including network and file usage, but when written to a file, usually a true \"header\" (containing copies of a few key attributes and details of the application which wrote it) is added.\n\n== Image display ==\nTo promote identical grayscale image display on different monitors and consistent hard-copy images from various printers, the DICOM committee developed a lookup table to display digitally assigned pixel values. To use the '''DICOM grayscale standard display function (GSDF)''',<ref>http://medical.nema.org/Dicom/2011/11_14pu.pdf</ref> images must be viewed (or printed) on devices that have this lookup curve or on devices that have been calibrated to the GSDF curve.<ref>Shiroma, J. T. (2006). An introduction to DICOM. Veterinary Medicine, 19-20. http://search.proquest.com/docview/195482647</ref>\n\n== Value representations ==\nIn addition to a value representation, each attribute also has a ''value multiplicity'' to indicate the number of data elements contained in the attribute. For character string value representations, if more than one data element is being encoded, the successive data elements are separated by the backslash character \"\\\".<ref>See [http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part05/sect_6.2.html#table_6.2-1 Table 6.2-1 of PS 3.5]</ref>\n\n== Services ==\nDICOM consists of services, most of which involve transmission of data over a network. The file format for offline media is a later addition to the standard.\n\n=== Store ===\nThe DICOM Store service is used to send images or other persistent objects (structured reports, etc.) to a [[picture archiving and communication system]] (PACS) or workstation.\n\n=== Storage commitment ===\nThe DICOM storage commitment service is used to confirm that an image has been permanently stored by a device (either on redundant disks or on backup media, e.g. burnt to a CD).  The Service Class User (SCU: similar to a [[Client\u2013server model|client]]), a modality or workstation, etc., uses the confirmation from the Service Class Provider (SCP: similar to a [[Client\u2013server model|server]]), an archive station for instance, to make sure that it is safe to delete the images locally.\n\n=== Query/retrieve ===\nThis enables a workstation to find lists of images or other such objects and then retrieve them from a picture archiving and communication system.\n\n=== Modality worklist ===\nThe DICOM modality worklist service provides a list of imaging procedures that have been scheduled for performance by an image acquisition device (sometimes referred to as a modality system).  The items in the worklist include relevant details about the subject of the procedure (patient ID, name, sex, and age), the type of procedure (equipment type, procedure description, procedure code) and the procedure order (referring physician, [[Accession number (bioinformatics)|accession number,]] reason for exam). An image acquisition device, such as a CT scanner, queries a service provider, such as a [[Radiological information system|RIS]], to get this information which is then presented to the system operator and is used by the imaging device to populate details in the image metadata.\n\nPrior to the use of the DICOM modality worklist service, the scanner operator was required to manually enter all the relevant details. Manual entry is slower and introduces the risk of misspelled patient names, and other data entry errors.\n\n=== Modality performed procedure step ===\nA complementary service to modality worklist, this enables the modality to send a report about a performed examination including data about the images acquired, beginning time, end time, and duration of a study, dose delivered, etc.\nIt helps give the radiology department a more precise handle on resource (acquisition station) use. Also known as MPPS, this service allows a modality to better coordinate with image storage servers by giving the server a list of objects to send before or while actually sending such objects.\n\n=== Print ===\nThe DICOM print service is used to send images to a DICOM printer, normally to print an \"X-Ray\" film. There is a standard calibration (defined in DICOM Part 14) to help ensure consistency between various display devices, including hard copy printout.\n\n=== Off-line media (files) ===\nThe format for off-line media files is specified in Part 10 of the DICOM Standard. Such files are sometimes referred to as \"Part 10 files\".\n\nDICOM restricts the filenames on DICOM media to 8 characters (some systems wrongly use 8.3, but this does not conform to the standard). No information must be extracted from these names (PS3.10 Section 6.2.3.2). This is a common source of problems with media created by developers who did not read the specifications carefully.  This is a historical requirement to maintain compatibility with older existing systems. It also mandates the presence of a media directory, the DICOMDIR file, which provides index and summary information for all the DICOM files on the media. The DICOMDIR information provides substantially greater information about each file than any filename could, so there is less need for meaningful file names.\n\nDICOM files typically have a .dcm file extension if they are not part of a DICOM media (which requires them to be without extension).\n\nThe [[MIME]] type for DICOM files is defined by RFC 3240 as application/dicom.\n\nThe [[Uniform Type Identifier]] type for DICOM files is org.nema.dicom.\n\nThere is also an ongoing media exchange test and \"connectathon\" process for CD media and network operation that is organized by the [[Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise|IHE]] organization.\n\n== Application areas ==\nThe core application of the DICOM standard is to capture, store and distribute medical images.  The standard also provides services related to imaging such as managing imaging procedure worklists, printing images on film or digital media like DVDs, reporting procedure status like completion of an imaging acquisition, confirming successful archiving of images, encrypting datasets, removing patient identifying information from datasets, organizing layouts of images for review, saving image manipulations and annotations, calibrating image displays, encoding ECGs, encoding CAD results, encoding structured measurement data, and storing acquisition protocols.\n\n=== Types of equipment ===\nThe DICOM information object definitions<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part03/PS3.3.html | title=PS3.3}}</ref> encode the data produced by a wide variety of imaging device types,<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part03/sect_C.7.3.html#sect_C.7.3.1.1.1 | title=C.7.3 Common Series IE Modules}}</ref> including,  [[CT scan|CT]] (computed tomography),  [[MRI]] (magnetic resonance imaging), [[ultrasound]], [[X-ray]], [[fluoroscopy]], [[angiography]], [[mammography]],  breast tomosynthesis, PET ([[positron emission tomography]]), [[SPECT]] (single photon emission computed tomography),  Endoscopy, microscopy,  nd whole slide imaging, OCT (optical coherence tomography).\n\nDICOM is also implemented by devices associated with images or imaging workflow including, [[Picture archiving and communication system|PACS]] (picture archiving and communication systems), image viewers and display stations, CAD (computer-aided detection/diagnosis systems), 3D visualization systems, clinical analysis applications, image printers, Film scanners, media burners (that export DICOM files onto CDs, DVDs, etc.), media importers (that import DICOM files from CDs, DVDs, USBs, etc.), [[Radiological information system|RIS]] (radiology information systems), VNA (vendor-neutral archives), EMR (electronic medical record) systems, and radiology reporting systems\n\n=== Fields of medicine ===\nMany fields of medicine have a dedicated Working Group within DICOM,<ref>[http://dicom.nema.org/dicom/geninfo/Strategy.pdf DICOM Strategy Document]</ref> and DICOM is applicable to any field of medicine in which imaging is prevalent, including:, radiology, cardiology, oncology, nuclear medicine, radiotherapy, neurology, orthopedics, obstetrics, gynecology, ophthalmology, dentistry, maxillofacial surgery, dermatology, pathology, clinical trials, veterinary medicine, and medical/clinical photography\n\n== Port numbers over IP ==\n\nDICOM have reserved the following [[TCP and UDP port]] numbers by the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA): 104 [[well-known port]] for DICOM over [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) or [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP). Since 104 is in the reserved subset, many operating systems require special privileges to use it;\n2761 [[registered port]] for DICOM using [[Integrated Secure Communication Layer]] (ISCL) over TCP or UDP;\n2762 registered port for DICOM using [[Transport Layer Security]] (TLS) over TCP or UDP;\n11112 registered port for DICOM using standard, open communication over TCP or UDP.\nThe standard recommends but does not require the use of these port numbers.\n\n== Disadvantages==\nAccording to a paper presented at an international symposium in 2008, the DICOM standard has problems related to data entry. \"A major disadvantage of the DICOM Standard is the possibility for entering probably too many optional fields. This disadvantage is mostly showing in inconsistency of filling all the fields with the data. Some image objects are often incomplete because some fields are left blank and some are filled with incorrect data.\"<ref>{{cite conference |url=http://www.vcl.fer.hr/papers_pdf/Overview%20of%20the%20DICOM%20Standard.pdf |first1=Mario |last1=Mustra |first2=Kresimir |last2=Delac |first3=Mislav |last3=Grgic |date=September 2008 |title=Overview of the DICOM Standard |conference=ELMAR, 2008. 50th International Symposium |location=Zadar, Croatia |isbn=978-1-4244-3364-3 |pages=39\u201344}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, the file format admits executable code and may contain [[malware]].<ref>{{ cite web | url = https://labs.cylera.com/2019/04/16/pe-dicom-medical-malware/ | title = HIPAA-Protected Malware?

[[Service (economics)|Services]] marketing emerged as a separate field of study in the early 1980s, following the recognition that the unique characteristics of services required different strategies compared with the marketing of physical goods.\n\nServices marketing typically refers to both [[business to consumer]] (B2C) and [[business-to-business]] (B2B) services, and includes marketing of services such as [[telecommunications service]]s, [[financial service]]s, all types of hospitality, [[tourism]] leisure and entertainment services, [[car rental]] services, [[health care]] services and [[professional services]] and trade services. Service marketers often use an expanded [[marketing mix]] which consists of the [[seven Ps]]: product, price, place, promotion, people, physical evidence and process. A contemporary approach, known as ''service-dominant logic'', argues that the demarcation between products and services that persisted throughout the 20th century was artificial and has obscured that everyone sells service. The S-D logic approach is changing the way that marketers understand ''[[value proposition|value-creation]]'' and is changing concepts of the [[consumer]]'s role in service delivery processes.\n\n==Services: definitions==\n\nThe [[American Marketing Association]] defines services marketing as an organisational function and a set of processes for identifying or creating, communicating, and delivering value to customers and for managing [[customer relationship]] in a way that benefit the organisation and stake-holders. Services are (usually) intangible economic activities offered by one party to another. Often time-based, services performed bring about desired results to recipients, objects, or other assets for which purchasers have responsibility. In exchange for money, time, and effort, service customers expect value from access to goods, labor, professional skills, facilities , networks, and systems; but they do not normally take ownership of any of the physical elements involved.<ref>Christopher Lovelock and Jochen Wirtz (2011), ''Services Marketing: People, Technology, Strategy,'' 7th ed., Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, Prentice Hall</ref>\n\n: '''A service encounter''' can be defined as the duration in which a customer interacts with a service. The customer's interactions with a service provider typically involve face-to-face contact with service personnel, in addition to interactions with the physical elements of the service environment including the facilities and equipment. <ref>Furnham, A.and Milner, R., \"The Impact of Mood on Customer Behavior: Staff Mood and Environmental Factors,\"  ''Journal of Retail and Consumer Services,'' Vo. 20, 2013, p. 634</ref>\n\n==Concepts of service==\n\n[[File:Advokat, Engelsk advokatdr\u00e4kt, Nordisk familjebok.png|thumb|Classical economists believed that service work, no matter how honourable, was 'unproductive'.]]\n\nScholars have long debated the nature of services. Some of the earliest attempts to define services focused on what makes them different from goods. Late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth century definitions highlighted the nature of ownership and wealth creation. Classical economists contended that goods were objects of value over which ownership rights could be established and exchanged. Ownership implied possession of a tangible object that had been acquired through purchase, barter or gift from the producer or previous owner and was legally identifiable as the property of the current owner. In contrast, when services were purchased, no title to goods changed hands.\n\n===Historical perspectives===\n\n[[Adam Smith]]'s seminal work, ''The Wealth of Nations'' (1776), distinguished between the outputs of what he termed \"productive\" and \"unproductive\" labor. The former, he stated, produced goods that could be stored after production and subsequently exchanged for money or other items of value. But unproductive labor, however \"honourable, ...useful, or... necessary\" created services that perished at the time of production and therefore didn't contribute to wealth.\n\nFrench economist [[Jean-Baptiste Say]] argued that production and consumption were inseparable in services, coining the term \"immaterial products\" to describe them.<ref>Smith, A., ''The Wealth of Nations,''1776</ref> In the 1920s, [[Alfred Marshall]] was still using the idea that services \"are immaterial products.\"<ref>Marshall, A., ''Principles of Economics'', 8th edition (1920), Macmillan, London</ref>\n\nIn the mid nineteenth century [[John Stuart Mill]] wrote that services are \"utilities not fixed or embodied in any object, but consisting of a mere service rendered ...without leaving a permanent acquisition.\"<ref>Mill, J.S., ''Principles of a Political Economy'', 1852 vol. 1, J.W. Parker, London, 1852</ref>\n\n===Contemporary perspectives===\n\nWhen services marketing emerged as a separate sub-branch within the marketing discipline in the early 1980s, it was largely a protest against the dominance of prevailing product-centric view.<ref>Gummesson, E.,  \"Implementing the Marketing Concept: From Service and Values to Lean Consumption,\" ''Marketing Theory,'' [Invited Commentary], vol. 6, no. 3, 2006, pp 291\u2013293</ref><ref>Schembri, S., \"Rationalizing Service Logic, or Understanding Services as Experience?\" ''Marketing Theory,'' vol 6, no. 3, 2006, pp 381\u2013392.</ref> In 1960, the US economy changed forever.

Technology and the Future of Work,'' Oxford University Press, 1996</ref> Scholars soon began to recognise that services were important in their own right, rather than as some residual category left over after goods were taken into account. This recognition triggered a change in the way services were defined. By the mid twentieth century, scholars began defining services in terms of their own unique characteristics, rather than by comparison with products.<ref>Berry, L.L. and Parasuraman, A., \n\"Building a New Academic Field: The Case of Services Marketing,\" ''Journal of Retailing,'' Vol. 69, no. 1, 993, pp 13-60</ref> The following set of definitions shows how scholars were grappling with the distinctive aspects of service products and developing new definitions of service.<ref>Furrer, O. and Sollberger,  P., \"The Dynamics and Evolution of the Service Marketing Literature: 1993\u20132003,\" ''Service Business,'' vol. 1, no. 2, 2006, pp 93-117</ref><ref>Fisk., R. and Grove,  S.J., [http://www.ifm.eng.cam.ac.uk/ssme/papers/Fisk_ssme_cambridge_07.pdf \"The Evolution of Services: Building a Multi-disciplinary Field\"],  [unpublished manuscript], 2007</ref>\n\n* \"Goods are produced: services are performed.\" (Rathmell, 1966) <ref>Rathmell, J.M., \"What is Meant By Services?\" ''Journal of Marketing'', October, 1966</ref>\t\n* \"A service is an activity or a series of activities which take place in interactions with a contact person or a physical machine and which provides consumer satisfaction.\" (Lehtinen, 1983<ref>Lehtinen, U., \"On Defining Service\", Proceedings of the X111th Annual Conference of the European Marketing Academy, Bruekelen, 1983</ref> \n* \"The heart of the service product is the experience of the consumer which takes place in real time... it is the interactive process itself that creates the benefits desired by the consumer.\" (Bateson, 1992) <ref>Bateson, J., ''Managing Services Marketing'', Dryden, Fort Worth, 1992</ref>\n* \"Services are deeds, processes and performances.\" (Zeithmal and Bitner, 1996) <ref>Zeithaml, V. and Bitner, M.J., ''Services Marketing'', International ed., Mc Graw-Hill, N.Y. 1996</ref>\n* \"Services are processes (economic activities) that provide time, place, form, problem-solving or experiential value to the recipient.\" (Lovelock, 2007) <ref>Lovelock, C., Patterson, P.G. and Walker, R.H., ''Services Marketing: An Asia-Pacific Perspective,'' Pearson Education Australia, French's Forest, NSW, 2007</ref>\n* \"The term 'service'... is synonymous with value.

Services are complex, multi-dimensional and multi-layered. Not only are there multiple benefits, but there are also a multiplicity of interactions between customers and organisations as well as between customers and other customers.\n\n==Framework==\n\n===Classification of goods and services===\n\n{{See also|Search good|Experience good|Credence good}}\n\nThere are many ways to classify services. One classification considers who or what is being processed and identifies three classes of services: people processing (e.g. beauty services, child care, medical services); mental stimulus processing (e.g. education services, counselling services, life-coaching), possession processing (e.g. pet care, appliance repair, piano tuning) and information processing (e.g. financial services, data warehousing services).<ref>Lovelock, C. and Wirtz, j., ''Services Marketing: People, Technology, Strategy,'' 7th ed., 2010, Chapter 2</ref><ref>Lovelock, C., \"Classifying Services to Gain Strategic Insight,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' vol. 47, Summer, 1983, pp 9-20</ref> Another method used to classify services uses the degree of customer interaction in the service process and classifies services as ''high contact'' (e.g. hospitality, dental care, hairdressing) or ''low contact''  (e.g. telecommunications, utility services).<ref>Grove, S.J., Fisk, R.P. and  John, J., \"Services as Theater: Guidelines and Implications,\"  in ''Handbook of Services Marketing and Management,'' Swartz, R., and Iacobucci, D (eds), Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage, 2000, p. 29</ref>\n\nBoth economists and marketers make extensive use of the Search \u2192 Experience \u2192 Credence (SEC) classification of goods and services. The classification scheme is based on the ease or difficulty of consumer evaluation activities and identifies three broad classes of goods.<ref>Ford, G.T., Smith, D.B.  and Swasy, J.L.

Consumers rely on prior experience, direct product inspection and other information search activities to locate information that assists in the evaluation process. Most products fall into the search goods category (e.g. clothing, office stationery, home furnishings).\n\n: ''Experience goods'': are goods or services that can be accurately evaluated only after the product has been purchased and experiences. Many personal services fall into this category (e.g. restaurant, hairdresser, beauty salon, theme park, travel, holiday).\n\n: ''Credence claims'': are goods or services that are difficult or impossible to evaluate even after consumption has occurred. Evaluation difficulties may arise because the consumer lacks the requisite knowledge or  technical expertise to make a realistic evaluation or, alternatively because the cost of information-acquisition is prohibitive or outweighs the value of the information available. Many professional services fall into this category (e.g. accountant, legal services, medical diagnosis/treatment, cosmetic surgery). These goods are called credence products because the consumer's quality evaluations depend entirely on the trust given to the product manufacturer or service provider.<ref>Jourdan, P., [http://acrwebsite.org/volumes/11342/volumes/ap04/AP-04 \"Search Or Experience Products: an Empirical Investigation of Services, Durable and Non-Durable Goods\"], in:  ''Asia Pacific Advances in Consumer Research '', Volume 4, Paula M. Tidwell and Thomas E. Muller (eds), Provo, UT, Association for Consumer Research,(2001), pp 167-174</ref>\n\nWhile some services may possess a number of search attributes (tangible dimensions), most services are high in experience or credence properties.  Empirical studies have shown that consumers' perceived risk increases along the search-experience-credence continuum.<ref>Mitra,K., Reiss, M.C. and Capella, L.M., \"An Examination of Perceived risk, Information Search and Behavioral Intentions in Search, Experience and Credence Services\", ''Journal of Services Marketing,'' Vol. 13, no.: 3, 1999, pp 208-228</ref> The implication is that services tend to be high involvement decisions \u2013 where the consumer invests more heavily in information search activities during the purchase decision.\n\n=== Risk perception and risk reduction in service purchase decisions ===\n{{See also|Consumer behaviour}}\n\n[[File:FGSQJ.jpg|thumb|Consumers are often nervous about air travel. Although the risk of a negative outcome is low, the severity of consequences is high in the event of a service failure.]]\n\nPerceived risk is associated with all purchasing decisions, both products and services alike. In terms of risk perception, marketers and economists argue that perceived purchase risk is higher for [[experience good]]s and [[credence goods]] with implications for consumer evaluation processes.<ref>Zeithaml, V. A., ''How Consumer Evaluation Processes Differ Between Goods and Services,'' (1981), in:  ''AMA Conference Proceedings'', James H. Donnelly and William R. George (eds), Chicago IL: American Marketing Association, p. 186-190</ref> Given that perceived risk drives the search for information in the pre-purchase stages of the consumer's decision process, consumers of services are more likely to engage in information acquisition activities as a means of ameliorating that risk. Any activity that a consumer undertakes in an effort to reduce perceived risk is known as a ''risk reduction activity''.\n\nRisk perception has been defined as \"a perception or feeling \"based on consumer's judgments of the likelihood of negative outcomes (uncertainty) and the degree of importance of these outcomes to the individual [consequences]\".<ref>Lovelock, C., Patterson, P. and Writz,J.,  ''Services Marketing: An Asia Pacific Perspective,'' Pearson, 2011 , p. 43</ref> Thus, pre-purchase risk is a function of two dimensions, namely:\n\n: ''Uncertainty'': the consumer's subjective assessment of the likelihood of occurrence \n: ''Consequence'': the severity of the outcome for the individual in the event that a poor purchase decision is made\n\nFor example, consider the case of a prospective air traveller. Most of us know that the probability of being involved in an airline disaster is low (low uncertainty).<ref>Ross, I., [http://acrwebsite.org/volumes/5741/volumes/v02/NA-02 \"Perceived Risk and Consumer Behavior: a Critical Review\"], in ''Advances in Consumer Research,''Volume 2, Mary Jane Schlinger (ed), MI, Association for Consumer Research, 1975, pp 1-20</ref> It is conventional wisdom that travellers are safer in the air than on the roads. Statistically, you are much more likely to be involved in a vehicular accident that an aircraft disaster. While the likelihood of personal harm arising from air travel is indeed very low, the consequences or an airline disaster however are very serious indeed (high consequence).  Whereas, car travellers who have been involved in a traffic accident often walk away with minor injuries, the same cannot be said for airline travellers.  It is the severity of the consequence rather than the uncertainty that plays into airline passengers' fears. Consumers are constantly weighing up uncertainty and consequences to reach subjective evaluations of the overall risk attached to various purchase decisions.\n\nRisk perception drives the information search process. Heightened risk perception may become a barrier to the natural progression of the purchase decision process and prevent customers from making a final brand choice. Consumers who are risk-averse tend to spend more time and effort engaged in information acquisition in the pre-purchase stage and look for specific types of information that will alleviate their perceptions of risk. Typical ''risk relievers'' might include such things as a reliance on personal sources of recommendation including word-of-mouth referrals; reliance on known and trusted brands, reading manufacturers' specifications, limited scale trial, reliance on warranties or guarantees etc.<ref name=\"Dowling, G.R 1994, pp. 119-134\">Dowling, G.R. and Staelin, R., \"A Model of Perceived Risk and Intended Risk-Handling Activity,\" ''Journal of Consumer Research'', Vol. 21, No. 1, 1994, pp. 119-134</ref>\n\n[[File:Mc Donalds Winterthur-Gr\u00fcze Ladentheke.jpg|thumb|Standardisation, sometimes called the McDonald's approach, helps to reduce perceived risk because consumers can rely on a known product and quality.]]\n\nRisk relievers that are especially relevant in service settings include:<ref name=\"Dowling, G.R 1994, pp. 119-134\"/><ref>Mitchell, V-W.  and  Greatorex, M., \"Risk Perception and Reduction in the Purchase of Consumer Services,\" ''Service Industries Journal'', 1993, pp 179-200</ref>\n\n:''High price maintenance:'' Some evidence suggests that risk-averse consumers often use high price as a guide to quality. Low prices may therefore be counter-productive since they suggest lower quality. Prestige pricing or premium pricing strategies are more likely to be indicated in service settings.\n\n: ''Limited scale trial:'' While some services cannot be fully trialled, marketers should think about limited scale trial or a virtual trial. e.g. use computer-aided design to visualise hairstyles, plastic surgery, Many virtual brand sites found online have successfully built of the notion of limited trial.  Other examples include: test driving a software application.\n\n:''Standardise the Product and Delivery:'' This is sometimes known as the McDonald's approach. Since variations in quality contribute to higher levels of perceived risk, one technique is to minimise variations by using production line techniques to control standards. This approach may be limited because many customers expect high levels of flexibility and customisation as part of the process. Standardisation needs to be fully communicated to customers \u2013 existing and potential \u2013 to be fully effective.\n\n: ''Purchase from a known or trusted brand'': Consumers of services may be more predisposed to use a known, reputable brand as an indicator of quality merchandise. For this reason, service providers are presented with greater opportunities to engage in relationship marketing\n\n===Matching supply and demand===\n\nService operations are often characterised by far more uncertainty with respect to the flow of demand. Service firms are often said to be ''capacity constrained''.<ref name=\"Lovelock. C.H. 1984, pp 12-30\">Lovelock. C.H., \"Strategies for Managing Demand in Capacity -Constrained Service Organisations,\" ''Services Industries Journal,'' vol.4, no. 3, 1984, pp 12-30,</ref>  This refers to the finite carrying capacity for most service operators and the lack of inventory which serves as a buffer against unexpected or peak demand.\n\nThere are two components to capacity (i.e., supply) in service operations:\n:''Number of employees'':  In medium and high contact systems, capacity is constrained by the number of contact staff available to provide service.\n\n:''Size of service environment'': Service environments have fixed space. A restaurant has a given number of tables, a hotel has a limited number of rooms, buses and trains are licensed to carry a specified number of passengers.\n\nThe factors contributing to uneven demand are more complex and difficult to predict. The components of demand may be seen as comprising long term demand patterns (trends), short term seasonal fluctuations and irregular effects.<ref>Australian Bureau of Statistics, [http://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/d3310114.nsf/4a256353001af3ed4b2562bb00121564/b81ecff00cd36415ca256ce10017de2f!OpenDocument ''Time Series: The Basics'']</ref>\n\n:''Long-term demand patterns:'' Most industries exhibit underlying trends in demand over longer time frames.  A trend is the long term direction in a time-series. Are sales growing, declining or stable? Often the trend in sales is related to the stage of the product life cycle. For example, industries in growth stages exhibit rapid increases in sales while industries in maturity may find that sales figures reach a plateau. Long-term demand patterns are stable and relatively easy to predict.\n\n:''Seasonal Factors:'' Seasonal components are systematic, calendar-related movements in sales.  Seasonal factors are recurring and relatively easy to predict. Seasonal factors might include peak and off peak seasons for a tourist resort. For a restaurant, however, peak seasons might coincide with main meal periods on a daily basis.  Other seasonal factors include trading day trading day effects and holiday periods.\n\n: ''Irregular Fluctuations:''  Irregular fluctuations are unsystematic, short term fluctuations. Irregular effects are highly unpredictable. e.g. inclement weather closes an airport, forcing local hotels to accommodate thousands of guests with minimal advance warning; an unexpected thunder storm leads to a surge in demand for umbrellas.\n\nWhen demand is low, capacity may be under-utilised while excess demand places enormous pressures on the service system. Service managers need to develop strategies for managing demand and supply under different conditions. Strategies for managing capacity involve careful consideration of both demand-side considerations and supply-side considerations.<ref>Mudie, P. and Pirrie, A., ''Services Marketing Management,'' 3rd ed., Butterworth-Heinemann, 2006; especially see Chapter 8 \"Demand & Capacity Management\" pp 157-176</ref>\n\n[[File:McDonald's trash (4970792904).jpg|thumb|Using customers' labour to clean tables and dispose of rubbish, as in this McDonald's restaurant, reduces pressures on the operating system by freeing up employees to focus on core service activities.]]\n\nOn the capacity side:<ref name=\"Lovelock. C.H. 1984, pp 12-30\"/>\n\n:''Add to capacity'' \u2013 hire additional staff (e.g. casuals or temporary staff for peak periods); add to space (e.g. extra floor space in retail, hospitality or increased fleet size in transport services) Increasing capacity may require service re-design and presents a longer term solution to capacity problems.\n:''Reconfigure interior space'' \u2013 with careful reconfiguration of interiors, it may be possible to accommodate a larger number of customers e.g. airline s to add to number of seats by reducing leg room.\n:''Use Customers to Boost Productivity'' \u2013 Customers labour can be harnessed to reduce pressures on the system e.g. self-service, e-ticketing.\n:''Transact business at arm's length'' \u2013 Use the internet or virtual delivery systems to transact business. \n:'' Ask Customers to use Third Parties'' \u2013 Where possible, have customers use agents or brokers to minimise the number of individual contacts and reduce pressure on the service system.\n:'' Share capacity'' \u2013 it may be possible to share capacity with other businesses e.g. airlines build strategic alliances with other operators so that excess demand can be booked or referred to a known ally (and does not involve  passengers losing frequent flyer points).\n\nOn the demand side:<ref>Blois, Keith J., \"Productivity and Effectiveness in Service Firms,\" ''Service Industries Journal,'' vol. 4 no. 3, 1984, pp 49-60</ref>\n\n[[File:Reception desk with a computer at a restaurant.JPG|thumb|Hotels and restaurants use computerised reservations systems to manage demand and supply.]]\n\n:''Locate and target market segments with different demand patterns'' \u2013 e.g. a ski resort could develop fishing and sight-seeing packages for bushwalkers and anglers to build demand during traditional off peak seasons.\n:''Develop innovative products for off peak periods'' \u2013 e.g. an airline could develop mystery flights, fly over Antarctica specials, singles flights, blues or jazz flights, gourmet flights, fight sensitivity training flights for nervous travellers, Winter wonderland specials, etc (a medium term strategy).\n:''Use efficiency based pricing methods'' \u2013 price incentives, such as time-based differential pricing (peak and off peak); market-based differential pricing (e.g. economy and business class); price-volume discounts, use pricing to encourage pre-booking which facilitates superior forecasting  e.g. Car hire company, Uber, uses ''surge pricing'' during periods of high demand.\n:''Use reservations systems to manage demand'' \u2013 ''yield management'' or ''dynamic pricing'' which uses a combination of segment-by-segment demand forecasting alongside subtle price adjustments (requires sophisticated software programs to analyse demand) e.g. hotels and airlines utilise yield management to set prices based on demand patterns.\n:''Use stand-by systems'' \u2013 allow customers the option of taking up last minute vacancies or \"no-show\" places.\n:''Shape demand''- management may attempt to shape demand patterns through customer education programs or lobbying e.g. encourage engaged couples to hold wedding ceremonies on days other than Saturday spread demand more evenly across the days of the week, lobby different state authorities to stagger scheduled school holiday periods in order to spread demand for holiday services more evenly across the year.\n\nWhen demand exceeds capacity, then reductions in service quality are a probable outcome. Over-crowding and lengthy waiting lines potentially erode the customer experience and place stresses on employees and the service system. Employees may compensate by minimising the time spent with each customer in an effort to serve more people, but such responses have the potential to introduce human error into service delivery. When capacity far exceeds supply, then capacity becomes idle. Spare capacity is unproductive and an inefficient use of resources. A short-term solution to spare capacity is to seek reductions in operating costs. For instance, management might ask staff to take leave, reduce number of check in counters open, limit number lifts operating and close off entire floors of a building to reduce operating costs during off peak periods as a means of achieving cost savings. In addition, routine maintenance tasks or planned refurbishment activities, which involve downtime, should be carried out during off peak periods to minimise disruption to patrons.\n\n====Managing waiting lines====\n\nWhen demand exceeds capacity, customers may have to wait for services. Lovelock identifies a range of different types of waiting lines or queuing systems:<ref>Lovelock, C. H. Patterson, P. G. and Walker, R.H. (2007), Services Marketing: An Asia-Pacific Perspective, Pearson Education Australia, French's Forest, NSW, pp 288-289</ref>\n[[File:Types of queing systems.jpg|thumb|Different types of queues]]\n\n: ''Single Line/ Single Server Queues'': Single line queues are among the most common. Examples can be found in cafes and sandwich bars around town. At Disneyland, for example, single line queues are employed despite the large numbers of visitors. However, Disney provides roving entertainers to visit waiting lines as a form of distraction.\n\n: ''Parallel Lines/ Multiple Servers'': Parallel lines are useful when there is more than one service station. However a major drawback is lines often move at different speeds. When patrons perceive that their line is moving more slowly, it can give rise to a sense of inequity. A variation of this type of queue is to devote some stations to different classes of customer. This variation is used in supermarkets where an express lane can be set up for customers with a small basket of items. It is also used at airport check-in counters where different lines form for economy class passengers and business class passengers.\n\n: ''Snake Queue'': The snake queue employs a physical race to guide customers through to the service station. Its main advantage is that all customers will be served on a first-in, first served basis, which for many people is the fairest system.\n\n: ''Take a Number'': In the take a number system customers do not need to form orderly queues once they have been assigned a number. Instead, customers can relax, enjoy the service firm's facilities until their number is called.\n\n: ''Other queue systems'': Of course, other types of system can be found in service environments. Hospital emergency department, for example, use ''[[Triage]]'' in which patients are assessed by a triage nurse who ranks the severity of their condition and assigns them to a doctor based on need.\n\n==Program==\n\n{{See also|Marketing mix|E. Jerome McCarthy}}\n\nThe argument that services require different marketing strategies is based on the insight that services are fundamentally different to goods and that services marketing requires different models to understand the marketing of services to customers.<ref>Anderson, Eugene W., Claes Fornell, and Roland T. Rust, ''Customer Satisfaction, Productivity, and Profitability: Differences Between Goods and Services,\" ''Marketing Science,'' vol 16, no.2, 1997, pp 129-145.</ref>  The \"marketing mix\" (also known as the ''four Ps'') is a foundation concept in [[marketing]] and has defined the so-called managerial approach since the 1960s.  The marketing mix or marketing program is understood to refer to the \"set of marketing tools that the firm uses to pursue its marketing objectives in the target market\".<ref>Kotler, P., ''Marketing Management'' (Millennium Edition), Custom Edition for University of Phoenix, Prentice Hall, 2000, p. 9</ref> The traditional marketing mix refers to four broad levels of marketing decision, namely: ''product'', ''price'', ''promotion'', and ''place''.<ref>{{cite book|last=McCarthy|first=Jerome E.|title=Basic Marketing.

At the Services Marketing Conference in 1981, Booms and Bitner proposed a model of seven Ps, comprising the original four Ps plus ''process, people'' and ''physical evidence'', as being more applicable for services marketing.<ref>Booms, B. and Bitner, M. J. \"Marketing Strategies and Organizational Structures for Service Firms\" in  James H. Donnelly and William R. George (eds), ''Marketing of Services'', Chicago: American Marketing Association, 47\u201351.</ref> Since then there have been a number of different proposals for a service marketing mix (with various numbers of Ps \u2013 6 Ps, 7 Ps, 8 Ps, 9 Ps and occasionally more). The model of 7 Ps has gained widespread acceptance, to the extent that some theorists have argued for the 7 Ps framework proposed by Booms and Bitner to be applied to products as a replacement for the four Ps.<ref>Rafiq,M. and Ahmed,P.K. \"Using the 7Ps as a Generic Marketing mix: An Exploratory Survey of UK and European Marketing Academics\", ''Marketing Intelligence & Planning'', Vol. 13, no. 9, pp 4\u201315</ref>\n\nThe extended marketing mix for services is more than the simple addition of three extra Ps. Rather it also modifies the traditional mix of product, price, place and promotion for superior application to services.\n\n==== Product====\n\n[[File:Total service product concept.jpg|thumb|Visualisation of the total service product concept]]\n\nService products are conceptualised as consisting of a bundle of tangible and intangible elements:<ref>Hoffman, K. D., Bateson, J.E.G., Elliot, G. and Birch, D., ''Service Marketing. Concepts, Strategies and Cases,'' Asia-Pacific Ed., Cengage Learning, Australia, 2010, pp 171-73</ref>\n\n: ''Core service:'' the basic reason for the business; that which solves consumer problems\n\n: ''Supplementary goods and services:'' supplements or adds value to the core product and helps differentiate the service from competitors   (e.g. consultation, safe-keeping, hospitality, exceptions)\n\n: ''Facilitating services'': (sometimes called ''delivery services''): Facilitate the delivery and consumption of the core service (are essential to delivery) (e.g. information provision, order-taking, billing, payment methods)\n\n: ''Supporting services'':  support the core and could be eliminated without destabilising the core.\n\nThe distinction between supplementary and facilitating services varies, depending on the nature of the service. For instance, the provision of coffee and tea would be considered a supporting service in a bank, but would be a facilitating service in a bed and breakfast facility. Whether an element is classified as facilitating or supporting depends on the context.\n\n==== Price====\n\nService marketers need to consider a range of other issues in price setting and management of prices:\n\n* '''Price Charged:''' the traditional [[pricing]] decision. \n* '''Timing of Payment:''' Given that customers are part of the service process and that some customers remain in the process for days, months or even years (e.g. guest house, hotel stay, university tuition), decisions must be made about whether to request payment at time when the service encounter is initiated, during the encounter or on termination of an encounter. Deposits, installments and exit fees are all options that can be considered.\n* '''Mode of Payment:''' Given that customers enter into long term relationships with service providers, it is possible that some patrons will expect to be able to pay on account. Payment options include: EFTPOS, direct transfer, cash/ credit cheque, invoice.\n\nMany service firms operate in industries where price is restricted by professional codes of conduct or by government influences which may have implications for pricing. It is possible to identify three broad scenarios:<ref>Cowell, D., ''The Marketing of Services,'' pp 147-60</ref>\n* Services subject to public regulation (e.g. healthcare, public transport)\n* Services subject to formal self-regulation  (e.g. universities, schools)\n* Services Subject to regulation of marketplace  (e.g. hospitality, tourism, leisure services)\nIn situations where the service is subject to some type of public regulation, government departments may establish [[ceiling price]]s which effectively limit the amount that can be charged.\n\nThe concept of a ''social price'' may be more important for service marketers. A social price refers to \"non financial aspects of price\". Fine identifies four types of social price: Time, Effort, Lifestyle and Psyche.<ref>Fine, S.,''Social Marketing,'' Allyn and Bacon, 1991, Chapter 9</ref> In effect, this means that consumers may be more acutely aware of the opportunity costs associated with the consumption of a service. In practice, this may mean that consumers of services experience a heightened sense of ''temporal risk.''\n\nThe most widely used pricing tactics in services marketing are: <ref>Kapoor, R., Paul, J. and Halder, B., ''Service Marketing: Concepts & Practices'', Tata McGraw-Hill Education, 2011, p. 79;  Chowhan, S.E., ''Marketing of Services'', Lulu.com, 2015, pp 33-34</ref>\n\n* High or low [[Pricing#Differential pricing|differential pricing]]\n* Flexible pricing\n* [[Pricing#Diversionary pricing|Diversionary pricing]]\n* [[Pricing#Offset pricing|Offset pricing]]\n* [[Pricing#Guaranteed pricing|Guaranteed pricing]]\n* [[Pricing#Loss leader|Loss leader]] pricing\n* Discounted pricing\n\n==== Place====\nIn making place decisions, there are several related questions which must be asked. What is the purpose of the distribution program? Who are the customers? Who should the intermediaries be?\n\n* Purpose of Distribution: Mass distribution; selective distribution or exclusive distribution\n* Number of levels in distribution channel: Direct distribution vs multi-marketing  and location decisions <ref>Donnelly, J.H., \"Marketing Intermediaries in Channels of Distribution for Services,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' vol. 40, January, 1976, pp 55 -70</ref><ref>Light, D., \"A Guide for New Distribution Channel Strategies for Service Firms,\" ''Journal of Business Strategy,'' vol. 7, Summer, 1986 and reproduced in John Bateson, ''Managing Services Marketing'', pp 427 -428</ref><ref>Egan, D., \"The Location of Service Outlets: An Economist's Perspective,\" ''Service Industries Journal,'' vol. 3, no. 2, 1983</ref>\n* Intermediaries: Agents versus Resellers; Brokers and other parties; Surrogate Consumers <ref>Bergen, M., Shanatu,D. and Walker, O.C., \"Agency Relationships In Marketing,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' vol. 56, July, 1992</ref><ref>Solomon, M.R., \" The Role of the Surrogate Consumer in Service Delivery,\" ''Service Industries Journal,'' vol. 9, no. 2, 1987, pp 292-307</ref>\n\n==== Promotion====\n\n===The expanded marketing mix===\n\nContemporary service marketing texts tend to be organised around a framework of ''seven Ps'' or ''eight Ps.'' The 7 Ps comprises the original 4 Ps plus ''process'', ''people'', ''physical environment''.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Booms|first=Bernard H.|author2=Bitner, Mary Jo|title=Marketing Strategies and Organization Structures for Service Firms|journal=Marketing of Services.

Therefore, service marketers must manage the physical evidence \u2013 which includes any element of the service environment which impacts on one or more of the customers five senses \u2013 the sense of smell, taste, hearing, sight and touch.<ref>Shostack, G.L., \"Breaking Free from Product Marketing,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' vol. 41, no. 2, 1977, pp 73-80</ref> Theorists identify two types of physical evidence, namely;<ref>Shostack, G.L., \"How to Design a Service,\" in Donnelly an, J.H. and George, W.R.

Credit cards are a type of peripheral evidence.]]\n\n:''Peripheral evidence:'' is actually possessed as part of the purchase of a service but has no independent value unless backed by the service.  e.g. a cheque book,  credit card, admission ticket, hotel stationery.\n: ''Essential evidence:'' unlike peripheral evidence cannot be possessed by the client. It contributes to ambience or image e.g. building and furnishings, layout, equipment, people etc\n\nA number of different theoretical traditions can be used to inform the study of service environments including stimulus-organism-response (SOR) models; [[environmental psychology]]; [[semiotics]] and Servicescapes.\n\n=====Stimulus-response models=====\n{{See also|Stimulus-response theory}}\n\nThe SOR model (stimulus\u2192organism\u2192response model) describes the way that organisms, which includes both customers and employees, respond to environmental stimuli. In a service setting the environmental stimuli might include lighting, ambient temperature, background music, layout and interior-design. In essence, the model proposes that people's responses exhibit both emotional and behavioural responses to stimuli in the external environment.\n\n===== Environmental psychology=====\n{{See also|Environmental psychology}}\n\n[[File:Environmental psychology model.jpg|thumb|]]\nEnvironmental psychologists investigate the impact of spatial environments on behaviour. Emotional responses to environmental stimuli fall into three dimensions; pleasure, arousal and dominance. The individual's  emotional state is thought to mediate the behavioural response, namely approach or avoidance behaviour towards the environment. Architects and designers can use insights from environmental psychology to design environments that promote desired emotional or behavioural outcomes.<ref>Donovan and Rossiter, J., \"Store Atmosphere: An Environmental Psychology Approach,\" ''Journal of Retailing,'' Vol;. 58, no. 1, 1982, pp 34-57</ref>\n\nThree emotional responses are suggested in the model. These responses should be understood as a continuum, rather than a discrete emotion, and customers can be visualised as falling anywhere along the continuum.<ref>Ridgway, Dawson and Bloch (1990) \"Pleasure and Arousal in the Marketplace: Interpersonal differences in approach-avoidance responses,\" ''Marketing Letters,'' vol 1, no 2, pp 139-47</ref>\n\n:''Pleasure\u2013displeasure'' refers to the emotional state reflecting the degree to which consumers and employees are satisfied with the service experience.\n\n:''Arousal\u2013non-arousal'' refers to the emotional state that reflects the degree to which consumers and employees feel excited and stimulated.\n\n:''Dominance\u2013submissiveness'' refers to the emotional state that reflects the degree to which consumers and employees feel in control and able to act freely within the service environment.\n\n[[File:Woolworths Closing-down Sale, Grimsby - geograph.org.uk - 1076911.jpg|thumb|Crowded, disorganised, unpredictable environments are said to be high load.]]\n\nThe individual's emotional response mediate the individual's behavioural response of ''Approach\u2192 Avoidance.'' Approach refers to the act of physically moving towards something while avoidance interferes with people's ability to interact. In a service environment, approach behaviours might be characterised by a desire to explore an unfamiliar environment, remain in the service environment, interact with the environment and with other persons in the environment and a willingness to perform tasks within that environment. Avoid behaviours are characterised by a desire to leave the establishment, ignore the service environment, and feelings disappointment with the service experience. Environments in which people feel they lack control are unattractive. Customers often understand the concept of approach intuitively when they comment that a particular place \"looks inviting\". The desired level of emotional arousal depends on the situation. For example, at a gym arousal might be more important than pleasure (No Pain; No gain). In a leisure setting, pleasure might be more important. If the environment pleases, then the customer will be induced to stay longer and explore all that the service has to offer. Too much arousal can be counter-productive. For instance, a romantic couple might feel out of place in a busy, noisy and cluttered restaurant. Obviously, some level of arousal is necessary as a motivation to buy. The longer a customer stays in an environment, the greater the opportunities to cross-sell a range of service offerings.\n\nMehrabian and Russell identified two types of environment based on the degree of information processing and stimulation:<ref>Mehrabian,A. and Russell, J.A., ''An  Approach  to  Environmental  Psychology,'' Cambridge, MA, MIT  Press</ref>\n\n: ''High load'': Environments that are unfamiliar, novel, complex, unpredictable or crowded are high load\n\n: ''Low load'':  Environments that are familiar, simple, unsurprising and well organised are low load.\n\nActivities or tasks that are low load require a more stimulating environment for optimum performance. If the task to be performed in relatively simple, routine or boring then users benefit from a slightly more stimulating environment. On the other hand, tasks that are complex or difficult may benefit from a low load environment. In a service environment, a high load environment encourages patrons to enter and explore the various service offerings and spaces.\n\n===== Servicescapes=====\n{{See also|Servicescape}}\n \n[[File:Servicescapes.pdf|thumb|Simplified servicescapes model]]\n\nThe servicescapes model was developed by Mary Jo Bitner and published in 1992. It is an applied model, specifically developed to inform the analysis of service environments, and was influenced by both stimulus-response theory and environmental psychology.\n\n======Physical environment dimensions======\n\nAs the diagram of the servicescapes model illustrates, the service environment consists of physical environment dimensions which act as stimuli. Environmental simulis are normally considered as three broad categories including:<ref>Bitner, M.J., \"Servicescapes: The Impact of Physical Surroundings on Customers and Employees,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' vol. 56, no. 2, 1992, pp 57 -71</ref><ref>Katz, K.L. and Rossiter, J.,  \"Store Atmosphere: An Environmental Psychology Approach,\" in Bateson, J.E.G., ''Managing Services Marketing: Text, Cases and Readings'', Dryden, Orlando, Fl, 1991, pp 227-243</ref>\n\n: ''Ambient Conditions'': Temperature, air quality, ambient noise, lighting, background music, odor, etc\n\n: ''Space/ Function'': Equipment such as cash registers, layout, furnishings and furniture, etc\n\n: ''Signs, symbols & Artefacts'': Directional signage, personal artefacts (e.g. souvenirs, mementos), corporate livery and logos, style of d\u00e9cor (including colour schemes), symbols etc\n\n[[File:Savoy Boutique private seminar room - panoramio.jpg|thumb|The seminar room at the Savoy Hotel clearly signals an up-market positioning. Spacious room, high backed covered chairs, timber surfaces and a complementary bar combine to communicate that this in intended for corporate use.]]\n\nEach element in the physical environment serves specific roles -and some may perform multiple roles. Signage may provide information, but may also serve to assist customers navigate their way through a complex service environment. For instance, furnishings may serve a functional role in that they provide seating, but the construction materials, such as fabric, tapestry and velvet may serve a symbolic role. Plush fabrics and generous drapery may suggest an elegant, up-market venue, while plastic chairs may signify an inexpensive, family-friendly venue.  When evaluating the servicescape, the combined effect of all the elements must also be taken into consideration.\n\n======The holistic environment ======\nWhen consumers enter a servicescape, they scan the ambient conditions, layout, furnishings and artefacts and aggregate them to derive an overall ''impression'' of the environment. In other words, the ''holistic environment'' represents the cumulative effect of multiple stimuli, most of which are processed within a split second. These types of global judgments represent the summation of processing multiple stimuli to form a single, overall impression in the consumer's mind.<ref>Hoffman, K. D., Bateson, J. E.G., Elliot, G. and Birch, D., ''Service Marketing. Concepts, Strategies and Cases,'' Asia-Pacific Edition, Cengage Learning Australia, 2010, pp 209-215</ref>\n\n[[File:Seminar room, Singapore University of Technology and Design - 20150602-02.jpg|thumb|The seminar room at Singapore University clearly signals an institutional application. Functional seating, ceiling mounted projectors, whiteboard, fluorescent lighting and schoolroom layout combine to suggest that the space is part of a practical educational environment.]]\n\nThrough careful design of the physical environment and ambient conditions, managers are able to communicate the service firm's values and positioning. Ideally, the physical environment will be designed to achieve desired behavioural outcomes. Clever use of space can be used to encourage patrons to stay longer since longer stays result in more opportunities to sell services. At other times, the ambient conditions can be manipulated to encourage avoidance behaviour. For example, at the end of a busy night of trading, a bar manager might turn the air conditioning up, turn up the lights, turn off the background music and start stacking chairs on top of tables. These actions send a signal to patrons that it is closing time.\n\n======Customers and employees: moderating and mediating factors ======\n\nCustomers and employees represent the two groups that regularly inhabit the servicescape. Their perceptions of the environment are likely to differe, because each comes to the space with different purposes and motivations. For example, a waiter in a restaurant is likely to be pleased to see a crowded dining room because more customers means more tips. Customers, on the other hand, might be less pleased with a crowded space because the noise and queues have the potential to diminish the service experience.\n\nIn the servicescape model, a moderator is anything that changes the standard stimulus-response emotional states of pleasure-displeasure, arousal-non-arousal or dominance-submissiveness while the mediator explains the response behaviour, typically in terms of internal responses (cognitive, emotional and physiological responses).<ref>Hoffman, K.D. and Bateson, J.E. G., ''Services Marketing: Concepts, Strategies, & Cases,'' Cengage, 2017, p. 215</ref> The consumer's response to an environment depends, at least in part, on situational factors such as the purpose or reason for being in the environment.<ref>Bitner, M.J., \"Servicescapes: The Impact of Physical Surroundings on Customers and Employees,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' vol. 56, no. 2, 1992, pp 64-65</ref> For example, a waiter in a restaurant is likely to be pleased to see a crowded dining room because more customers means more tips. Customers, on the other hand, might be less pleased with a crowded space because the noise and queues have the potential to diminish the service experience.\n\n======Behavioural response======\n\nThe model shows that there are different types of response \u2013 individual response (''approach'' and ''avoid'')  and  interaction responses (e.g.''social interactions'').\n\nIn the context of servicescapes, ''approach'' has a special meaning.  It refers to how customers utilize the space, during and after the service encounter. Approach behaviours demonstrated during the encounter include:<ref>Bitner, M.J., \"Servicescapes: The Impact of Physical Surroundings on Customers and Employees,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' vol. 56, no. 2, 1992, pp 60-63</ref>\n\n: ''Enter and explore'' \u2013 exhibiting a desire to explore the total service offering, a willingness to do more things, keen to learn about all the company's products and services; showing an interest in [[cross-selling]] opportunities as presented\n\n: ''Stay longer'' \u2013 exhibiting a willingness to remain within the physical environment; longer stays present more opportunities for cross-selling, up-selling or impulse buying. Some studies have shown a correlation between length of stay and the size of average patron expenditure\n\n: ''Carry out plan'' \u2013 exhibiting a willingness to act on information provided, fully immerse themselves in the experience and a determination to achieve personal goals\n\n: ''Social interactions'' refer to customer-employee interactions as well as customer-customer interactions. In some services, such as clubs, bars and tours, the act of meeting other people and interacting with other customers forms an integral part of the service experience. Managers need to think about design features that can be used to facilitate interactions between patrons. For instance, some cafeterias and casual dining establishments install communal dining tables for the express purpose of encouraging customers to mix and socialise.\n\n[[File:CentralPark Vendor.JPG|thumb|Kiosks are lean servicescapes - simple, orderly, few employees, few spaces and familiar environments.]]\n\nDifferent types of approach behaviours demonstrated at the conclusion of the encounter or after the encounter may include: ''affiliation'' \u2013 a willingness to become a regular user, form intention to revisit; ''commitment'' \u2013 the formation of intention to become brand advocate, to provide referrals, write favourable online reviews or give positive word-of-mouth recommendations.\n\n======Types of servicescape======\n\nBitner's pioneering work on servicescapes identified two broad types of service environment:<ref>Bitner, M.J., \"Servicescapes: The Impact of Physical Surroundings on Customers and Employees,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' vol. 56, no. 2, 1992, pp 58-59</ref>\n[[File:Harrods Food Hall - geograph.org.uk - 908825.jpg|thumb|Department stores offer an elaborate servicescape with multiple levels and spaces, rich in physical elements and symbolism.]]\n: ''Lean servicescapes'' \u2013 environments that comprise relatively few spaces, contain few elements and involve few interactions between customers and employees. e.g. kiosks, vending machines, self-service retail outlets, fast food outlets. Designing lean environments is relatively straight-forward\n\n: ''Elaborate servicescapes'' \u2013 environments that comprise multiple spaces, are rich in physical elements and symbolism, involve high contact services with many interactions between customers and employees. Examples include international hotels and ocean liners with guest accommodation, concierge, bars, restaurants, swimming pools, gymnasiums and other supplementary services where guests interact with multiple personnel during their stay which might extend over multiple days. Designing elaborate environments requires skilled design teams who are fully apprised of the desired behavioural outcomes and the corporate vision.\n\nAccording to the model's developer, the servicescape acts like a \"product's package\" \u2013 by communicating a total image to customers and providing information about how to use the service. It can also serve as a point of difference by signalling which segments of the market are served, positioning the organisation and conveying competitive distinctiveness.<ref>Bitner, M.J., \"Servicescapes: The Impact of Physical Surroundings on Customers and Employees,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' vol. 56, no. 2, 1992, p. 67</ref>\n\n=== Service process===\n\nWhen customers enter a service firm they participate in a process. During that process, customers become quasi-employees; that is they are partial producers and they have the opportunity to see the organisation from the employee's perspective. To use a manufacturing analogy, customers are able to examine 'unfinished goods' \u2013 that is faulty and defective goods, glitches in the production system are in full view, with obvious implications for customer enjoyment and satisfaction. In addition, customers interactions with both employees and other customers becomes part of the total service experience with obvious implications for service quality and productivity.  Both customers and staff must be educated to effectively use the process. Controlling the service delivery process is more than a simple management issue. The customer's presence in the system means that the service process must be treated as a marketing issue.\n\n====Blueprinting for design and diagnosis====\n\n{{See also|Service blueprint}}\n\n[[File:Service blueprint.jpg|thumb|A service blueprint for a hypothetical fast food outlet]]\n\nBlueprinting is a technique designed to document the ''visible'' customer experience.<ref>Shostack, G. L., \"Service Positioning through Structural Change,\" ''Journal of Marketing'', vol. 51, no. 1, 1987, pp 34-43</ref> In its simplest form, the service blueprint is an applied process chart which shows the service delivery process from the customer's perspective. The original service blueprint is a highly visual, graphical map that delineates the key contact points in the service process and the nature of the contact \u2013 whether with physical evidence, personnel or procedures. It can be seen as a two dimensional map in which the horizontal axis represents time and the vertical axis represents the basic steps in the process.  A line of visibility is included to separate actions visible to the customer from actions out of sight.  Employee latitude, which refers to the amount of discretion given to employees to vary the service process, is shown on the map a call-out sign attached to the step a shown in the figure. Process complexity is shown simply by the number of steps in the process.\n\nIt was originally intended to be used as a tool to assist with service design and structural positioning.<ref>Shostack, G. Lynn.

''Complexity'' refers to the number and intricacy of the steps required to perform the service. ''Divergence'' refers to the degree of latitude, freedom, judgment, discretion, variability or situational adaptation permitted within any step of the process. \n                  \nManipulations of the blueprint diagram might include increasing complexity, by adding more steps, or increasing divergence by allowing employees greater latitude in varying each step. In general, service processes that include high levels of employee discretion to vary steps to meet the needs of individual customers are moving towards customisation. On the other hand, reducing divergence, by standardising each step, often adds to complexity, but can result in a production-line approach to service process design. By manipulating complexity and divergence, it is possible to envisage four different positioning strategies:<ref>Shostack, G.L., \"How to Design a Service,\" in Donnelly an, J.H. and George, W.R.

Like many fast food restaurants, Subway utilises a ''race'' to corral customers and move them in a one-way direction. Prominently displayed 'In' and 'Out' signage reinforces the direction of the desired traffic flow. Customers can peruse an overhead backlit menu while they are waiting in line which speeds up the order-taking process and reduces opportunities for bottlenecks. Other signage provides customers with information about the Subway process e.g. select bread, select filling, select sauce, pay and exit. The arrangement of food behind the glass counter not only displays the choice of sandwich fillings, but supports the process since customers must select their preferences in a specific sequence, as they inch their way towards the cash register. In Australia, the distinctive moves used by Subway customers as they shuffle along the race, selecting their sandwich breads and fillings has become affectionately known as the \u2018Subway shuffle'.<ref>''AdBrief'', [https://gotothesource.com.au/content/uploads/2013/02/ADB1792_pf.pdf \"Campaign News\"] [Australia], Issue no. 1792, 6 March 2009, p. 4</ref><ref>''AdNews'', [http://www.adnews.com.au/BC43A782-900D-4850-9710F17CDAB16B0D \"Daily Round-Up\"] 13 February 2009</ref> Every aspect of Subway's store design and layout reinforces the core objectives of customisation, volume-operations (i.e. rapid turnover) and operational efficiency.\n\n===People===\n\n{{See also|Customer experience|Internal communications}}\n\nThe ''people'' dimension refers to the human actors who are participants in the service encounter, namely employees and customers.<ref>Hoffman, D., Bateson, J.E.G., Elliot, G. and Birch, S., Services Marketing: Concepts, Strategies and Cases (Asia-Pacific ed.), Cengage, 2010, pp 226-274</ref> For many service marketers, the human interaction constitutes the heart of the service experience.<ref>Bateson, J. , ''Managing Services Marketing: Text, Cases and Readings,''  Orlando, Fl, Dryden, p. 7</ref> Service personnel are important because they are the ''face'' of the company and represent the company's values to customers.

Studies have shown that emotional labour can lead to undesirable consequences for employees including job-related stress, burnout, job dissatisfaction and withdrawal. If left untreated, these types of stressors can be very damaging to morale.\n\nManaging the behaviour of customers and employees in the service encounter is difficult. Consistent behaviour cannot be prescribed. It can, however, be nurtured in subtle and indirect ways.<ref>Harris, P.

This analogy is also known as a ''dramaturgical perspective.'' In such an analogy, service personnel are the ''actors'', customers are the ''audience''; uniforms are ''costumes''; the work setting is the ''stage'' (front-stage for areas where interaction occurs and ''back-stage'' for areas off limits to customers); discrete steps in the service process are ''scenes'' and finally the words and actions that occur represent the ''performance''.<ref>Grove, S.J., Fisk, R.P. and  John, J., \"Services as Theater: Guidelines and Implications,\"  in ''Handbook of Services Marketing and Management,'' Swartz, R., and Iacobucci, D (eds), Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage, 2000, pp 21-35</ref><ref>Grove, S.J., Fisk, R.P., [http://acrwebsite.org/volumes/7341/volumes/v19/NA-19 \"The Service Experience As Theater\"], in ''Advances in Consumer Research,'' Vol. 19, John F.

In this school of thought, service quality is conceptualised as consisting of two broad dimensions, namely:<ref>Gr\u00f6nroos, C., \"A service quality model and its marketing implications,\" ''European Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 18, No. 4, 1984, 36\u201344. doi:10.1108/EUM0000000004784</ref>\n\n: ''Technical quality'': (What was delivered) \n: ''Functional quality'': (How it was delivered)\n\nThe technical dimension can usually be measured \u2013 but the functional dimension is difficult to measure due to subjective interpretations which vary from customer to customer.<ref>Gr\u00f6nroos, C., ''Service Management and Marketing: Managing the Moments of Truth in Service Competition,'' Lexington, Mass: Lexington Books, 1990</ref>\n\n====The Gaps model====\n{{See also|SERVQUAL}}\n[[File:Servqual.jpg|thumb|The model of service quality]]\n\nThe model of service quality or the ''gaps model'' as it is popularly known, was developed by team of researchers, Parasuraman, Zeithaml and Berry, in the mid to late 1980s.<ref>Parasuraman, A, Ziethaml, V. and Berry, L.L., \"SERVQUAL: A Multiple- Item Scale for Measuring Consumer Perceptions of Service Quality' ''Journal of Retailing,'' Vol. 62,  no. 1, 1988, p. 25</ref> and has become the dominant approach for identifying service quality problems and diagnosing their probable causes.<ref>Ladhari, R., \"A Review of Twenty Years of SERVQUAL Research\", International Journal of Quality and Service Sciences, Vol. 1 no. 2, pp 172\u2013198</ref> This approach conceptualises service quality  as a gap between consumer's expectations of a forthcoming service encounter and their actual perceptions of that encounter.<ref>Zeithaml, V., Parasuraman, A. and Berry, L.L., ''Delivering Service Quality: Balancing Customer Perceptions and Expectations,'' N.Y., The Free Press, 1990</ref> Accordingly, service quality can be represented by the equation:<ref>Zeithaml, V.A., Berry, L.L. and Parasuraman, A., \"Communication and Control Processes in the Delivery of Service Quality,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 52, No. 2, 1988, pp. 35-48</ref>\n\n'''SQ = P- E'''\n: where;\n\n: '''SQ''' is service quality\n: '''P''' is the individual's perceptions of given service delivery\n: '''E''' is the individual's expectations of a given service delivery\n\nThe model which provides the overall conceptual framework helps analysts to identify the service quality gap (Gap 5 in the model) and to understand the probable causes of service quality related problems (Gaps 1-4 in the model). The diagnostic value of the model accounts at least, in part, for the instrument's continuing currency in service quality research.<ref>Asubonteng, P., McCleary, K.J. and Swan, J.E.,  \"SERVQUAL Revisited: A Critical Review of Service Quality\", ''Journal of Services Marketing,'' Vol. 10, no 6, 1996, pp 62-81</ref><ref>Ladhari, R., \"A review of twenty years of SERVQUAL research\", ''International Journal of Quality and Service Sciences,'' Vol. 1 no. 2, pp. 172\u2013198</ref><ref>Nyeck, S., Morales, M., Ladhari, R., & Pons, F., \"10 Years of Service Quality  Measurement: Reviewing the use of the SERVQUAL Instrument,\" ''Cuadernos de Difusion,'' Vol. 7, no 13, pp 101-107.</ref>\n\n[[File:Measuring service quality using SERVQUAL model (Kumar et al, 2009).png|thumb|The five dimensions of service quality]]\n\nThe model's developers also devised a research instrument, called SERVQUAL, to measure the size and direction of service quality problems (i.e. gap 5).<ref>Parasuraman, A., Berry, L.L. and Zeithaml, V.A.,  \"Refinement and Reassessment of the SERVQUAL scale,\" ''Journal of Retailing,'' Vol. 67, no. 4, 1991, pp 57-67</ref> The questionnaire is multi-dimensional instrument, designed to  having capture five dimensions of service quality; namely reliability, assurance, tangibles, empathy and responsiveness, which are believed to represent the consumer's understanding of service quality.

Both the expectations component and the perceptions component of the questionnaire consist a total of 22 items, comprising 4 items to capture tangibles, 5 items to capture reliability, 4 items for responsiveness, 5 items for assurance and 5 items to capture empathy.<ref>Based on Parasuraman, A, Ziethaml, V. and Berry, L.L., \"SERVQUAL: A Multiple- Item Scale for Measuring Consumer Perceptions of Service Quality' Journal of Retailing, Vol. 62, no. 1, 1988, [Appendix: SERVQUAL questionnaire, pp 37-40</ref> The questionnaire, which is designed to be administered in a face-to-face interview and requires a moderate to large size sample for statistical reliability, is lengthy and can take more than one hour to administer to reach respondent. In practice, researchers customarily add extra items to the 44 SERVQUAL items to capture information about the respondent's demographic profile, prior experience with the brand or category and behavioural intentions (intention to revisit/ repurchase, loyalty intentions and propensity to give word-of-mouth referrals). Thus, the final questionnaire may have up to 60 items, which contributes to substantial time and cost in terms of administration, coding and data analysis.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Summary of SERVQUAL questionnaire dimensions and items<ref>Based on Zeithaml, V., Parasuraman, A. and Berry, L.L., ''Delivering Service Quality: Balancing Customer Perceptions and Expectations,'' N.Y., The Free Press, 1990</ref>\n|-\n!

J. and Taylor, S. A., \"Measuring Service Quality: A Re-examination and Extension,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 56, no. 3, 1992 pp 55-68</ref> The scale is known as SERVPERF and is considerably shorter than SERVQUAL, and therefore easier and cheaper to administer. Results from the use of SERVPERF correlate well with SERVQUAL.<ref>Cronin J.J., Steven, J. and Taylor, A., \"SERVPERF versus SERVQUAL: Reconciling performance based and perceptions-minus-expectations measurement of service quality,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 58, January, 1994, pp 125-131</ref> This approach utilises a different conceptualisation of service quality, which can be represented by the equation:\n\n'''SQ = P'''\n: where;\n\n: '''SQ''' is service quality\n: '''P''' is the individual's perceptions of given service delivery\n\nAlthough SERVPERF has a number of advantages in terms of administration, it has attracted criticism. The performance only instrument lacks the diagnostic value of the SERVQUAL since it includes only one variable (P) compared to SERVQUAL's richer data with two variables (P and E).<ref>Elliott, K. M., \"SERVPERF versus SERVQUAL: A Marketing  Management Dilemma when Assessing Service Quality,\" ''Journal of Marketing Management,'' Vol. 4, no. 2, 1994, pp 56-61</ref><ref>Carrillat, F.A., Jaramillo, F. and Mulki, J.P., \"The Validity of the SERVQUAL and SERVPERF Scales: A Meta\u2010analytic View of 17 years of Research across Five Continents\", ''International Journal of Service Industry Management,'' Vol. 18, no. 5, 2007, pp 472-490</ref> To illustrate, consider one source of quality related problems which occurs when customers have unrealistically high expectations. SERVQUAL has no problem detecting such problems, however, SERVPERF can never detect this problem because it does not capture expectations. When choosing an appropriate instrument for investigations into service quality, service marketers must weigh up the expediency of SERVPERF against the diagnostic power of SERVQUAL.\n\n==Services dominant logic: implications for theory and practice==\n{{See also|Service-dominant logic}}\n\nService-dominant logic (SDL) is a new way of thinking about marketing, especially the goods versus services division and especially a fresh way of thinking about customer value and the value-creation process. Vargo and Lusch did not intend for service-dominant logic to be published as a workable theory that offers solutions to everyday marketing problems and issues. Instead, it offers a framework for thinking about goods and services. Their work did not put forward hypotheses that could be tested empirically, Instead they offer \"foundational propositions.\"  The original article offered eight such propositions<ref>Vargo, S. L. and Lusch, R.F., \"Evolving to a New Dominant Logic for Marketing,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' vol 68, no. 1, 2004, pp 1-17.</ref> and subsequently added two more propositions to arrive at a total of ten:<ref>Vargo, S. L. and Robert F. Lusch, \"Service-dominant Logic: Continuing the Evolution\",  ''Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science,'' Vol. 36, no. 1, 2008, pp 1-10</ref>\n\nSome of the implications that have been identified in the literature include:\n\n''SDL offers the promise of a unified marketing theory'': To date, marketing research and practice have failed to integrate the traditional goods/services dichotomy. Some efforts have been made to get product accepted as a joint term for goods and services and to use offering, package or solution as all inclusive, concepts for what consumers the buys, but this has not been successful.<ref>Gummesson, E., \"Exit Services Marketing- Enter Service Marketing,\" in: Michael Baker and Susan Hart (eds), ''The Marketing Book'', 6th edition, Butterworth-Heinemann, 2008, pp 451-471</ref> Service-dominant logic, however, promises a truly unified framework. For many academics, this is the most exciting implication. It is highly likely that the 4 Ps, as the central marketing framework, is about to come to a close.\n\n''Compete Through Innovative Co-production and Co-creation'': Some theorists point out that, thanks largely to the Internet, consumers have been actively engaging themselves in explicit dialogue with manufacturers and service providers.<ref>Prahalad, C.K. and Ramaswamy, V. (2000) \"Co-opting Customer Competence,\" ''Harvard Business Review,'' vol. 78, no. 1, pp 79-87</ref> The challenge is for service firms to find innovative ways to achieve co-production and co-creation. Customer co-creation has become the foundation concept for social sharing web sites such as YouTube, Myspace and Twitter.  Many companies have moved from testing products in the contrived and artificial conditions of a laboratory to product testing in customer environments. At Microsoft, for example, consumers acted as product researchers by testing Windows 2000 in their native environments. A different approach is to use embedded intelligence to provide enhanced personalised experiences.\n\n''Research Priorities'': SDL has forced the discipline to review its research priorities.  Researchers and scholars are beginning to identify a range of subjects that require more detailed exploration. Some theorists have argued that marketing practitioners must find new ways of understanding customers' value creation and of developing marketing strategies with an aim to engage suppliers with their customers' consumption processes in order to enhance customer satisfaction.<ref>Vargo, S.L., \"Customer Integration and Value Creation: Paradigmatic Traps and Perspectives,\" ''Journal of Service Research,'' vol. 11, no. 2, 2008, pp 211-215.</ref> Other research priorities include: the personalised customer experience,<ref>Lusch, R.F., Vargo, S.L. and O'Brien, M., \"Competing through Service: Insights from Service-dominant Logic,\" ''Journal of Retailing,'' Vol. 83, no. 1, 2007, pp 5-18</ref> resource integration,<ref>Baron, S.  and Harris, K. \"Consumers as Resource Integrators,\" ''Journal of Marketing Management,'' vol. 24, no. 1/2, 2008, p113-130</ref> improved use of IT to map processes and activities in order to increase productivity and standardise service.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Consumer behaviour]]\n* [[Customer experience]]\n* [[Destination marketing]]\n* [[Industrialization of services business model]]\n* [[Service blueprint]]\n* [[Service design]]\n* [[Service quality]]\n* [[Service system]]\n* [[Servicescape]]s\n* [[Service-dominant logic]]\n* [[Servitization of products business model]]\n* [[SERVQUAL]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Alan Wilson, Valarie Zeithaml, Mary Jo Bitner and Dwayne D.

[[Service (economics)|Services]] marketing emerged as a separate field of study in the early 1980s, following the recognition that the unique characteristics of services required different strategies compared with the marketing of physical goods.\n\nServices marketing typically refers to both [[business to consumer]] (B2C) and [[business-to-business]] (B2B) services, and includes marketing of services such as [[telecommunications service]]s, [[financial service]]s, all types of hospitality, [[tourism]] leisure and entertainment services, [[car rental]] services, [[health care]] services and [[professional services]] and trade services. Service marketers often use an expanded [[marketing mix]] which consists of the [[seven Ps]]: product, price, place, promotion, people, physical evidence and process. A contemporary approach, known as ''service-dominant logic'', argues that the demarcation between products and services that persisted throughout the 20th century was artificial and has obscured that everyone sells service. The S-D logic approach is changing the way that marketers understand ''[[value proposition|value-creation]]'' and is changing concepts of the [[consumer]]'s role in service delivery processes.\n\n==Services: definitions==\n\nThe [[American Marketing Association]] defines services marketing as an organisational function and a set of processes for identifying or creating, communicating, and delivering value to customers and for managing [[customer relationship]] in a way that benefit the organisation and stake-holders. Services are (usually) intangible economic activities offered by one party to another. Often time-based, services performed bring about desired results to recipients, objects, or other assets for which purchasers have responsibility. In exchange for money, time, and effort, service customers expect value from access to goods, labor, professional skills, facilities , networks, and systems; but they do not normally take ownership of any of the physical elements involved.<ref>Christopher Lovelock and Jochen Wirtz (2011), ''Services Marketing: People, Technology, Strategy,'' 7th ed., Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, Prentice Hall</ref>\n\n: '''A service encounter''' can be defined as the duration in which a customer interacts with a service. The customer's interactions with a service provider typically involve face-to-face contact with service personnel, in addition to interactions with the physical elements of the service environment including the facilities and equipment. <ref>Furnham, A.and Milner, R., \"The Impact of Mood on Customer Behavior: Staff Mood and Environmental Factors,\"  ''Journal of Retail and Consumer Services,'' Vo. 20, 2013, p. 634</ref>\n\n==Concepts of service==\n\n[[File:Advokat, Engelsk advokatdr\u00e4kt, Nordisk familjebok.png|thumb|Classical economists believed that service work, no matter how honourable, was 'unproductive'.]]\n\nScholars have long debated the nature of services. Some of the earliest attempts to define services focused on what makes them different from goods. Late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth century definitions highlighted the nature of ownership and wealth creation. Classical economists contended that goods were objects of value over which ownership rights could be established and exchanged. Ownership implied possession of a tangible object that had been acquired through purchase, barter or gift from the producer or previous owner and was legally identifiable as the property of the current owner. In contrast, when services were purchased, no title to goods changed hands.\n\n===Historical perspectives===\n\n[[Adam Smith]]'s seminal work, ''The Wealth of Nations'' (1776), distinguished between the outputs of what he termed \"productive\" and \"unproductive\" labor. The former, he stated, produced goods that could be stored after production and subsequently exchanged for money or other items of value. But unproductive labor, however \"honourable, ...useful, or... necessary\" created services that perished at the time of production and therefore didn't contribute to wealth.\n\nFrench economist [[Jean-Baptiste Say]] argued that production and consumption were inseparable in services, coining the term \"immaterial products\" to describe them.<ref>Smith, A., ''The Wealth of Nations,''1776</ref> In the 1920s, [[Alfred Marshall]] was still using the idea that services \"are immaterial products.\"<ref>Marshall, A., ''Principles of Economics'', 8th edition (1920), Macmillan, London</ref>\n\nIn the mid nineteenth century [[John Stuart Mill]] wrote that services are \"utilities not fixed or embodied in any object, but consisting of a mere service rendered ...without leaving a permanent acquisition.\"<ref>Mill, J.S., ''Principles of a Political Economy'', 1852 vol. 1, J.W. Parker, London, 1852</ref>\n\n===Contemporary perspectives===\n\nWhen services marketing emerged as a separate sub-branch within the marketing discipline in the early 1980s, it was largely a protest against the dominance of prevailing product-centric view.<ref>Gummesson, E.,  \"Implementing the Marketing Concept: From Service and Values to Lean Consumption,\" ''Marketing Theory,'' [Invited Commentary], vol. 6, no. 3, 2006, pp 291\u2013293</ref><ref>Schembri, S., \"Rationalizing Service Logic, or Understanding Services as Experience?\" ''Marketing Theory,'' vol 6, no. 3, 2006, pp 381\u2013392.</ref> In 1960, the US economy changed forever.

Technology and the Future of Work,'' Oxford University Press, 1996</ref> Scholars soon began to recognise that services were important in their own right, rather than as some residual category left over after goods were taken into account. This recognition triggered a change in the way services were defined. By the mid twentieth century, scholars began defining services in terms of their own unique characteristics, rather than by comparison with products.<ref>Berry, L.L. and Parasuraman, A., \n\"Building a New Academic Field: The Case of Services Marketing,\" ''Journal of Retailing,'' Vol. 69, no. 1, 993, pp 13-60</ref> The following set of definitions shows how scholars were grappling with the distinctive aspects of service products and developing new definitions of service.<ref>Furrer, O. and Sollberger,  P., \"The Dynamics and Evolution of the Service Marketing Literature: 1993\u20132003,\" ''Service Business,'' vol. 1, no. 2, 2006, pp 93-117</ref><ref>Fisk., R. and Grove,  S.J., [http://www.ifm.eng.cam.ac.uk/ssme/papers/Fisk_ssme_cambridge_07.pdf \"The Evolution of Services: Building a Multi-disciplinary Field\"],  [unpublished manuscript], 2007</ref>\n\n* \"Goods are produced: services are performed.\" (Rathmell, 1966) <ref>Rathmell, J.M., \"What is Meant By Services?\" ''Journal of Marketing'', October, 1966</ref>\t\n* \"A service is an activity or a series of activities which take place in interactions with a contact person or a physical machine and which provides consumer satisfaction.\" (Lehtinen, 1983<ref>Lehtinen, U., \"On Defining Service\", Proceedings of the X111th Annual Conference of the European Marketing Academy, Bruekelen, 1983</ref> \n* \"The heart of the service product is the experience of the consumer which takes place in real time... it is the interactive process itself that creates the benefits desired by the consumer.\" (Bateson, 1992) <ref>Bateson, J., ''Managing Services Marketing'', Dryden, Fort Worth, 1992</ref>\n* \"Services are deeds, processes and performances.\" (Zeithmal and Bitner, 1996) <ref>Zeithaml, V. and Bitner, M.J., ''Services Marketing'', International ed., Mc Graw-Hill, N.Y. 1996</ref>\n* \"Services are processes (economic activities) that provide time, place, form, problem-solving or experiential value to the recipient.\" (Lovelock, 2007) <ref>Lovelock, C., Patterson, P.G. and Walker, R.H., ''Services Marketing: An Asia-Pacific Perspective,'' Pearson Education Australia, French's Forest, NSW, 2007</ref>\n* \"The term 'service'... is synonymous with value.

Services are complex, multi-dimensional and multi-layered. Not only are there multiple benefits, but there are also a multiplicity of interactions between customers and organisations as well as between customers and other customers.\n\n==Framework==\n\n===Classification of goods and services===\n\n{{See also|Search good|Experience good|Credence good}}\n\nThere are many ways to classify services. One classification considers who or what is being processed and identifies three classes of services: people processing (e.g. beauty services, child care, medical services); mental stimulus processing (e.g. education services, counselling services, life-coaching), possession processing (e.g. pet care, appliance repair, piano tuning) and information processing (e.g. financial services, data warehousing services).<ref>Lovelock, C. and Wirtz, j., ''Services Marketing: People, Technology, Strategy,'' 7th ed., 2010, Chapter 2</ref><ref>Lovelock, C., \"Classifying Services to Gain Strategic Insight,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' vol. 47, Summer, 1983, pp 9-20</ref> Another method used to classify services uses the degree of customer interaction in the service process and classifies services as ''high contact'' (e.g. hospitality, dental care, hairdressing) or ''low contact''  (e.g. telecommunications, utility services).<ref>Grove, S.J., Fisk, R.P. and  John, J., \"Services as Theater: Guidelines and Implications,\"  in ''Handbook of Services Marketing and Management,'' Swartz, R., and Iacobucci, D (eds), Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage, 2000, p. 29</ref>\n\nBoth economists and marketers make extensive use of the Search \u2192 Experience \u2192 Credence (SEC) classification of goods and services. The classification scheme is based on the ease or difficulty of consumer evaluation activities and identifies three broad classes of goods.<ref>Ford, G.T., Smith, D.B.  and Swasy, J.L.

Consumers rely on prior experience, direct product inspection and other information search activities to locate information that assists in the evaluation process. Most products fall into the search goods category (e.g. clothing, office stationery, home furnishings).\n\n: ''Experience goods'': are goods or services that can be accurately evaluated only after the product has been purchased and experiences. Many personal services fall into this category (e.g. restaurant, hairdresser, beauty salon, theme park, travel, holiday).\n\n: ''Credence claims'': are goods or services that are difficult or impossible to evaluate even after consumption has occurred. Evaluation difficulties may arise because the consumer lacks the requisite knowledge or  technical expertise to make a realistic evaluation or, alternatively because the cost of information-acquisition is prohibitive or outweighs the value of the information available. Many professional services fall into this category (e.g. accountant, legal services, medical diagnosis/treatment, cosmetic surgery). These goods are called credence products because the consumer's quality evaluations depend entirely on the trust given to the product manufacturer or service provider.<ref>Jourdan, P., [http://acrwebsite.org/volumes/11342/volumes/ap04/AP-04 \"Search Or Experience Products: an Empirical Investigation of Services, Durable and Non-Durable Goods\"], in:  ''Asia Pacific Advances in Consumer Research '', Volume 4, Paula M. Tidwell and Thomas E. Muller (eds), Provo, UT, Association for Consumer Research,(2001), pp 167-174</ref>\n\nWhile some services may possess a number of search attributes (tangible dimensions), most services are high in experience or credence properties.  Empirical studies have shown that consumers' perceived risk increases along the search-experience-credence continuum.<ref>Mitra,K., Reiss, M.C. and Capella, L.M., \"An Examination of Perceived risk, Information Search and Behavioral Intentions in Search, Experience and Credence Services\", ''Journal of Services Marketing,'' Vol. 13, no.: 3, 1999, pp 208-228</ref> The implication is that services tend to be high involvement decisions \u2013 where the consumer invests more heavily in information search activities during the purchase decision.\n\n=== Risk perception and risk reduction in service purchase decisions ===\n{{See also|Consumer behaviour}}\n\n[[File:FGSQJ.jpg|thumb|Consumers are often nervous about air travel. Although the risk of a negative outcome is low, the severity of consequences is high in the event of a service failure.]]\n\nPerceived risk is associated with all purchasing decisions, both products and services alike. In terms of risk perception, marketers and economists argue that perceived purchase risk is higher for [[experience good]]s and [[credence goods]] with implications for consumer evaluation processes.<ref>Zeithaml, V. A., ''How Consumer Evaluation Processes Differ Between Goods and Services,'' (1981), in:  ''AMA Conference Proceedings'', James H. Donnelly and William R. George (eds), Chicago IL: American Marketing Association, p. 186-190</ref> Given that perceived risk drives the search for information in the pre-purchase stages of the consumer's decision process, consumers of services are more likely to engage in information acquisition activities as a means of ameliorating that risk. Any activity that a consumer undertakes in an effort to reduce perceived risk is known as a ''risk reduction activity''.\n\nRisk perception has been defined as \"a perception or feeling \"based on consumer's judgments of the likelihood of negative outcomes (uncertainty) and the degree of importance of these outcomes to the individual [consequences]\".<ref>Lovelock, C., Patterson, P. and Writz,J.,  ''Services Marketing: An Asia Pacific Perspective,'' Pearson, 2011 , p. 43</ref> Thus, pre-purchase risk is a function of two dimensions, namely:\n\n: ''Uncertainty'': the consumer's subjective assessment of the likelihood of occurrence \n: ''Consequence'': the severity of the outcome for the individual in the event that a poor purchase decision is made\n\nFor example, consider the case of a prospective air traveller. Most of us know that the probability of being involved in an airline disaster is low (low uncertainty).<ref>Ross, I., [http://acrwebsite.org/volumes/5741/volumes/v02/NA-02 \"Perceived Risk and Consumer Behavior: a Critical Review\"], in ''Advances in Consumer Research,''Volume 2, Mary Jane Schlinger (ed), MI, Association for Consumer Research, 1975, pp 1-20</ref> It is conventional wisdom that travellers are safer in the air than on the roads. Statistically, you are much more likely to be involved in a vehicular accident that an aircraft disaster. While the likelihood of personal harm arising from air travel is indeed very low, the consequences or an airline disaster however are very serious indeed (high consequence).  Whereas, car travellers who have been involved in a traffic accident often walk away with minor injuries, the same cannot be said for airline travellers.  It is the severity of the consequence rather than the uncertainty that plays into airline passengers' fears. Consumers are constantly weighing up uncertainty and consequences to reach subjective evaluations of the overall risk attached to various purchase decisions.\n\nRisk perception drives the information search process. Heightened risk perception may become a barrier to the natural progression of the purchase decision process and prevent customers from making a final brand choice. Consumers who are risk-averse tend to spend more time and effort engaged in information acquisition in the pre-purchase stage and look for specific types of information that will alleviate their perceptions of risk. Typical ''risk relievers'' might include such things as a reliance on personal sources of recommendation including word-of-mouth referrals; reliance on known and trusted brands, reading manufacturers' specifications, limited scale trial, reliance on warranties or guarantees etc.<ref name=\"Dowling, G.R 1994, pp. 119-134\">Dowling, G.R. and Staelin, R., \"A Model of Perceived Risk and Intended Risk-Handling Activity,\" ''Journal of Consumer Research'', Vol. 21, No. 1, 1994, pp. 119-134</ref>\n\n[[File:Mc Donalds Winterthur-Gr\u00fcze Ladentheke.jpg|thumb|Standardisation, sometimes called the McDonald's approach, helps to reduce perceived risk because consumers can rely on a known product and quality.]]\n\nRisk relievers that are especially relevant in service settings include:<ref name=\"Dowling, G.R 1994, pp. 119-134\"/><ref>Mitchell, V-W.  and  Greatorex, M., \"Risk Perception and Reduction in the Purchase of Consumer Services,\" ''Service Industries Journal'', 1993, pp 179-200</ref>\n\n:''High price maintenance:'' Some evidence suggests that risk-averse consumers often use high price as a guide to quality. Low prices may therefore be counter-productive since they suggest lower quality. Prestige pricing or premium pricing strategies are more likely to be indicated in service settings.\n\n: ''Limited scale trial:'' While some services cannot be fully trialled, marketers should think about limited scale trial or a virtual trial. e.g. use computer-aided design to visualise hairstyles, plastic surgery, Many virtual brand sites found online have successfully built of the notion of limited trial.  Other examples include: test driving a software application.\n\n:''Standardise the Product and Delivery:'' This is sometimes known as the McDonald's approach. Since variations in quality contribute to higher levels of perceived risk, one technique is to minimise variations by using production line techniques to control standards. This approach may be limited because many customers expect high levels of flexibility and customisation as part of the process. Standardisation needs to be fully communicated to customers \u2013 existing and potential \u2013 to be fully effective.\n\n: ''Purchase from a known or trusted brand'': Consumers of services may be more predisposed to use a known, reputable brand as an indicator of quality merchandise. For this reason, service providers are presented with greater opportunities to engage in relationship marketing\n\n===Matching supply and demand===\n\nService operations are often characterised by far more uncertainty with respect to the flow of demand. Service firms are often said to be ''capacity constrained''.<ref name=\"Lovelock. C.H. 1984, pp 12-30\">Lovelock. C.H., \"Strategies for Managing Demand in Capacity -Constrained Service Organisations,\" ''Services Industries Journal,'' vol.4, no. 3, 1984, pp 12-30,</ref>  This refers to the finite carrying capacity for most service operators and the lack of inventory which serves as a buffer against unexpected or peak demand.\n\nThere are two components to capacity (i.e., supply) in service operations:\n:''Number of employees'':  In medium and high contact systems, capacity is constrained by the number of contact staff available to provide service.\n\n:''Size of service environment'': Service environments have fixed space. A restaurant has a given number of tables, a hotel has a limited number of rooms, buses and trains are licensed to carry a specified number of passengers.\n\nThe factors contributing to uneven demand are more complex and difficult to predict. The components of demand may be seen as comprising long term demand patterns (trends), short term seasonal fluctuations and irregular effects.<ref>Australian Bureau of Statistics, [http://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/d3310114.nsf/4a256353001af3ed4b2562bb00121564/b81ecff00cd36415ca256ce10017de2f!OpenDocument ''Time Series: The Basics'']</ref>\n\n:''Long-term demand patterns:'' Most industries exhibit underlying trends in demand over longer time frames.  A trend is the long term direction in a time-series. Are sales growing, declining or stable? Often the trend in sales is related to the stage of the product life cycle. For example, industries in growth stages exhibit rapid increases in sales while industries in maturity may find that sales figures reach a plateau. Long-term demand patterns are stable and relatively easy to predict.\n\n:''Seasonal Factors:'' Seasonal components are systematic, calendar-related movements in sales.  Seasonal factors are recurring and relatively easy to predict. Seasonal factors might include peak and off peak seasons for a tourist resort. For a restaurant, however, peak seasons might coincide with main meal periods on a daily basis.  Other seasonal factors include trading day trading day effects and holiday periods.\n\n: ''Irregular Fluctuations:''  Irregular fluctuations are unsystematic, short term fluctuations. Irregular effects are highly unpredictable. e.g. inclement weather closes an airport, forcing local hotels to accommodate thousands of guests with minimal advance warning; an unexpected thunder storm leads to a surge in demand for umbrellas.\n\nWhen demand is low, capacity may be under-utilised while excess demand places enormous pressures on the service system. Service managers need to develop strategies for managing demand and supply under different conditions. Strategies for managing capacity involve careful consideration of both demand-side considerations and supply-side considerations.<ref>Mudie, P. and Pirrie, A., ''Services Marketing Management,'' 3rd ed., Butterworth-Heinemann, 2006; especially see Chapter 8 \"Demand & Capacity Management\" pp 157-176</ref>\n\n[[File:McDonald's trash (4970792904).jpg|thumb|Using customers' labour to clean tables and dispose of rubbish, as in this McDonald's restaurant, reduces pressures on the operating system by freeing up employees to focus on core service activities.]]\n\nOn the capacity side:<ref name=\"Lovelock. C.H. 1984, pp 12-30\"/>\n\n:''Add to capacity'' \u2013 hire additional staff (e.g. casuals or temporary staff for peak periods); add to space (e.g. extra floor space in retail, hospitality or increased fleet size in transport services) Increasing capacity may require service re-design and presents a longer term solution to capacity problems.\n:''Reconfigure interior space'' \u2013 with careful reconfiguration of interiors, it may be possible to accommodate a larger number of customers e.g. airline s to add to number of seats by reducing leg room.\n:''Use Customers to Boost Productivity'' \u2013 Customers labour can be harnessed to reduce pressures on the system e.g. self-service, e-ticketing.\n:''Transact business at arm's length'' \u2013 Use the internet or virtual delivery systems to transact business. \n:'' Ask Customers to use Third Parties'' \u2013 Where possible, have customers use agents or brokers to minimise the number of individual contacts and reduce pressure on the service system.\n:'' Share capacity'' \u2013 it may be possible to share capacity with other businesses e.g. airlines build strategic alliances with other operators so that excess demand can be booked or referred to a known ally (and does not involve  passengers losing frequent flyer points).\n\nOn the demand side:<ref>Blois, Keith J., \"Productivity and Effectiveness in Service Firms,\" ''Service Industries Journal,'' vol. 4 no. 3, 1984, pp 49-60</ref>\n\n[[File:Reception desk with a computer at a restaurant.JPG|thumb|Hotels and restaurants use computerised reservations systems to manage demand and supply.]]\n\n:''Locate and target market segments with different demand patterns'' \u2013 e.g. a ski resort could develop fishing and sight-seeing packages for bushwalkers and anglers to build demand during traditional off peak seasons.\n:''Develop innovative products for off peak periods'' \u2013 e.g. an airline could develop mystery flights, fly over Antarctica specials, singles flights, blues or jazz flights, gourmet flights, fight sensitivity training flights for nervous travellers, Winter wonderland specials, etc (a medium term strategy).\n:''Use efficiency based pricing methods'' \u2013 price incentives, such as time-based differential pricing (peak and off peak); market-based differential pricing (e.g. economy and business class); price-volume discounts, use pricing to encourage pre-booking which facilitates superior forecasting  e.g. Car hire company, Uber, uses ''surge pricing'' during periods of high demand.\n:''Use reservations systems to manage demand'' \u2013 ''yield management'' or ''dynamic pricing'' which uses a combination of segment-by-segment demand forecasting alongside subtle price adjustments (requires sophisticated software programs to analyse demand) e.g. hotels and airlines utilise yield management to set prices based on demand patterns.\n:''Use stand-by systems'' \u2013 allow customers the option of taking up last minute vacancies or \"no-show\" places.\n:''Shape demand''- management may attempt to shape demand patterns through customer education programs or lobbying e.g. encourage engaged couples to hold wedding ceremonies on days other than Saturday spread demand more evenly across the days of the week, lobby different state authorities to stagger scheduled school holiday periods in order to spread demand for holiday services more evenly across the year.\n\nWhen demand exceeds capacity, then reductions in service quality are a probable outcome. Over-crowding and lengthy waiting lines potentially erode the customer experience and place stresses on employees and the service system. Employees may compensate by minimising the time spent with each customer in an effort to serve more people, but such responses have the potential to introduce human error into service delivery. When capacity far exceeds supply, then capacity becomes idle. Spare capacity is unproductive and an inefficient use of resources. A short-term solution to spare capacity is to seek reductions in operating costs. For instance, management might ask staff to take leave, reduce number of check in counters open, limit number lifts operating and close off entire floors of a building to reduce operating costs during off peak periods as a means of achieving cost savings. In addition, routine maintenance tasks or planned refurbishment activities, which involve downtime, should be carried out during off peak periods to minimise disruption to patrons.\n\n====Managing waiting lines====\n\nWhen demand exceeds capacity, customers may have to wait for services. Lovelock identifies a range of different types of waiting lines or queuing systems:<ref>Lovelock, C. H. Patterson, P. G. and Walker, R.H. (2007), Services Marketing: An Asia-Pacific Perspective, Pearson Education Australia, French's Forest, NSW, pp 288-289</ref>\n[[File:Types of queing systems.jpg|thumb|Different types of queues]]\n\n: ''Single Line/ Single Server Queues'': Single line queues are among the most common. Examples can be found in cafes and sandwich bars around town. At Disneyland, for example, single line queues are employed despite the large numbers of visitors. However, Disney provides roving entertainers to visit waiting lines as a form of distraction.\n\n: ''Parallel Lines/ Multiple Servers'': Parallel lines are useful when there is more than one service station. However a major drawback is lines often move at different speeds. When patrons perceive that their line is moving more slowly, it can give rise to a sense of inequity. A variation of this type of queue is to devote some stations to different classes of customer. This variation is used in supermarkets where an express lane can be set up for customers with a small basket of items. It is also used at airport check-in counters where different lines form for economy class passengers and business class passengers.\n\n: ''Snake Queue'': The snake queue employs a physical race to guide customers through to the service station. Its main advantage is that all customers will be served on a first-in, first served basis, which for many people is the fairest system.\n\n: ''Take a Number'': In the take a number system customers do not need to form orderly queues once they have been assigned a number. Instead, customers can relax, enjoy the service firm's facilities until their number is called.\n\n: ''Other queue systems'': Of course, other types of system can be found in service environments. Hospital emergency department, for example, use ''[[Triage]]'' in which patients are assessed by a triage nurse who ranks the severity of their condition and assigns them to a doctor based on need.\n\n==Program==\n\n{{See also|Marketing mix|E. Jerome McCarthy}}\n\nThe argument that services require different marketing strategies is based on the insight that services are fundamentally different to goods and that services marketing requires different models to understand the marketing of services to customers.<ref>Anderson, Eugene W., Claes Fornell, and Roland T.

The marketing mix or marketing program is understood to refer to the \"set of marketing tools that the firm uses to pursue its marketing objectives in the target market\".<ref>Kotler, P., ''Marketing Management'' (Millennium Edition), Custom Edition for University of Phoenix, Prentice Hall, 2000, p. 9</ref> The traditional marketing mix refers to four broad levels of marketing decision, namely: ''product'', ''price'', ''promotion'', and ''place''.<ref>{{cite book|last=McCarthy|first=Jerome E.|title=Basic Marketing.

At the Services Marketing Conference in 1981, Booms and Bitner proposed a model of seven Ps, comprising the original four Ps plus ''process, people'' and ''physical evidence'', as being more applicable for services marketing.<ref>Booms, B. and Bitner, M. J. \"Marketing Strategies and Organizational Structures for Service Firms\" in  James H. Donnelly and William R. George (eds), ''Marketing of Services'', Chicago: American Marketing Association, 47\u201351.</ref> Since then there have been a number of different proposals for a service marketing mix (with various numbers of Ps \u2013 6 Ps, 7 Ps, 8 Ps, 9 Ps and occasionally more). The model of 7 Ps has gained widespread acceptance, to the extent that some theorists have argued for the 7 Ps framework proposed by Booms and Bitner to be applied to products as a replacement for the four Ps.<ref>Rafiq,M. and Ahmed,P.K. \"Using the 7Ps as a Generic Marketing mix: An Exploratory Survey of UK and European Marketing Academics\", ''Marketing Intelligence & Planning'', Vol. 13, no. 9, pp 4\u201315</ref>\n\nThe extended marketing mix for services is more than the simple addition of three extra Ps. Rather it also modifies the traditional mix of product, price, place and promotion for superior application to services.\n\n==== Product====\n\n[[File:Total service product concept.jpg|thumb|Visualisation of the total service product concept]]\n\nService products are conceptualised as consisting of a bundle of tangible and intangible elements:<ref>Hoffman, K. D., Bateson, J.E.G., Elliot, G. and Birch, D., ''Service Marketing. Concepts, Strategies and Cases,'' Asia-Pacific Ed., Cengage Learning, Australia, 2010, pp 171-73</ref>\n\n: ''Core service:'' the basic reason for the business; that which solves consumer problems\n\n: ''Supplementary goods and services:'' supplements or adds value to the core product and helps differentiate the service from competitors   (e.g. consultation, safe-keeping, hospitality, exceptions)\n\n: ''Facilitating services'': (sometimes called ''delivery services''): Facilitate the delivery and consumption of the core service (are essential to delivery) (e.g. information provision, order-taking, billing, payment methods)\n\n: ''Supporting services'':  support the core and could be eliminated without destabilising the core.\n\nThe distinction between supplementary and facilitating services varies, depending on the nature of the service. For instance, the provision of coffee and tea would be considered a supporting service in a bank, but would be a facilitating service in a bed and breakfast facility. Whether an element is classified as facilitating or supporting depends on the context.\n\n==== Price====\n\nService marketers need to consider a range of other issues in price setting and management of prices:\n\n* '''Price Charged:''' the traditional [[pricing]] decision. \n* '''Timing of Payment:''' Given that customers are part of the service process and that some customers remain in the process for days, months or even years (e.g. guest house, hotel stay, university tuition), decisions must be made about whether to request payment at time when the service encounter is initiated, during the encounter or on termination of an encounter. Deposits, installments and exit fees are all options that can be considered.\n* '''Mode of Payment:''' Given that customers enter into long term relationships with service providers, it is possible that some patrons will expect to be able to pay on account. Payment options include: EFTPOS, direct transfer, cash/ credit cheque, invoice.\n\nMany service firms operate in industries where price is restricted by professional codes of conduct or by government influences which may have implications for pricing. It is possible to identify three broad scenarios:<ref>Cowell, D., ''The Marketing of Services,'' pp 147-60</ref>\n* Services subject to public regulation (e.g. healthcare, public transport)\n* Services subject to formal self-regulation  (e.g. universities, schools)\n* Services Subject to regulation of marketplace  (e.g. hospitality, tourism, leisure services)\nIn situations where the service is subject to some type of public regulation, government departments may establish [[ceiling price]]s which effectively limit the amount that can be charged.\n\nThe concept of a ''social price'' may be more important for service marketers. A social price refers to \"non financial aspects of price\". Fine identifies four types of social price: Time, Effort, Lifestyle and Psyche.<ref>Fine, S.,''Social Marketing,'' Allyn and Bacon, 1991, Chapter 9</ref> In effect, this means that consumers may be more acutely aware of the opportunity costs associated with the consumption of a service. In practice, this may mean that consumers of services experience a heightened sense of ''temporal risk.''\n\nThe most widely used pricing tactics in services marketing are: <ref>Kapoor, R., Paul, J. and Halder, B., ''Service Marketing: Concepts & Practices'', Tata McGraw-Hill Education, 2011, p. 79;  Chowhan, S.E., ''Marketing of Services'', Lulu.com, 2015, pp 33-34</ref>\n\n* High or low [[Pricing#Differential pricing|differential pricing]]\n* Flexible pricing\n* [[Pricing#Diversionary pricing|Diversionary pricing]]\n* [[Pricing#Offset pricing|Offset pricing]]\n* [[Pricing#Guaranteed pricing|Guaranteed pricing]]\n* [[Pricing#Loss leader|Loss leader]] pricing\n* Discounted pricing\n\n==== Place====\nIn making place decisions, there are several related questions which must be asked. What is the purpose of the distribution program? Who are the customers? Who should the intermediaries be?\n\n* Purpose of Distribution: Mass distribution; selective distribution or exclusive distribution\n* Number of levels in distribution channel: Direct distribution vs multi-marketing  and location decisions <ref>Donnelly, J.H., \"Marketing Intermediaries in Channels of Distribution for Services,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' vol. 40, January, 1976, pp 55 -70</ref><ref>Light, D., \"A Guide for New Distribution Channel Strategies for Service Firms,\" ''Journal of Business Strategy,'' vol. 7, Summer, 1986 and reproduced in John Bateson, ''Managing Services Marketing'', pp 427 -428</ref><ref>Egan, D., \"The Location of Service Outlets: An Economist's Perspective,\" ''Service Industries Journal,'' vol. 3, no. 2, 1983</ref>\n* Intermediaries: Agents versus Resellers; Brokers and other parties; Surrogate Consumers <ref>Bergen, M., Shanatu,D. and Walker, O.C., \"Agency Relationships In Marketing,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' vol. 56, July, 1992</ref><ref>Solomon, M.R., \" The Role of the Surrogate Consumer in Service Delivery,\" ''Service Industries Journal,'' vol. 9, no. 2, 1987, pp 292-307</ref>\n\n==== Promotion====\n\n===The expanded marketing mix===\n\nContemporary service marketing texts tend to be organised around a framework of ''seven Ps'' or ''eight Ps.'' The 7 Ps comprises the original 4 Ps plus ''process'', ''people'', ''physical environment''.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Booms|first=Bernard H.|author2=Bitner, Mary Jo|title=Marketing Strategies and Organization Structures for Service Firms|journal=Marketing of Services.

Therefore, service marketers must manage the physical evidence \u2013 which includes any element of the service environment which impacts on one or more of the customers five senses \u2013 the sense of smell, taste, hearing, sight and touch.<ref>Shostack, G.L., \"Breaking Free from Product Marketing,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' vol. 41, no. 2, 1977, pp 73-80</ref> Theorists identify two types of physical evidence, namely;<ref>Shostack, G.L., \"How to Design a Service,\" in Donnelly an, J.H. and George, W.R.

Ill, 1981, pp 221-29</ref>\n\n[[File:Credit-cards.jpg|thumb|Credit cards have no independent value unless backed by the service. Credit cards are a type of peripheral evidence.]]\n\n:''Peripheral evidence:'' is actually possessed as part of the purchase of a service but has no independent value unless backed by the service.  e.g. a cheque book,  credit card, admission ticket, hotel stationery.\n: ''Essential evidence:'' unlike peripheral evidence cannot be possessed by the client. It contributes to ambience or image e.g. building and furnishings, layout, equipment, people etc\n\nA number of different theoretical traditions can be used to inform the study of service environments including stimulus-organism-response (SOR) models; [[environmental psychology]]; [[semiotics]] and Servicescapes.\n\n=====Stimulus-response models=====\n{{See also|Stimulus-response theory}}\n\nThe SOR model (stimulus\u2192organism\u2192response model) describes the way that organisms, which includes both customers and employees, respond to environmental stimuli. In a service setting the environmental stimuli might include lighting, ambient temperature, background music, layout and interior-design. In essence, the model proposes that people's responses exhibit both emotional and behavioural responses to stimuli in the external environment.\n\n===== Environmental psychology=====\n{{See also|Environmental psychology}}\n\n[[File:Environmental psychology model.jpg|thumb|]]\nEnvironmental psychologists investigate the impact of spatial environments on behaviour. Emotional responses to environmental stimuli fall into three dimensions; pleasure, arousal and dominance. The individual's  emotional state is thought to mediate the behavioural response, namely approach or avoidance behaviour towards the environment. Architects and designers can use insights from environmental psychology to design environments that promote desired emotional or behavioural outcomes.<ref>Donovan and Rossiter, J., \"Store Atmosphere: An Environmental Psychology Approach,\" ''Journal of Retailing,'' Vol;. 58, no. 1, 1982, pp 34-57</ref>\n\nThree emotional responses are suggested in the model. These responses should be understood as a continuum, rather than a discrete emotion, and customers can be visualised as falling anywhere along the continuum.<ref>Ridgway, Dawson and Bloch (1990) \"Pleasure and Arousal in the Marketplace: Interpersonal differences in approach-avoidance responses,\" ''Marketing Letters,'' vol 1, no 2, pp 139-47</ref>\n\n:''Pleasure\u2013displeasure'' refers to the emotional state reflecting the degree to which consumers and employees are satisfied with the service experience.\n\n:''Arousal\u2013non-arousal'' refers to the emotional state that reflects the degree to which consumers and employees feel excited and stimulated.\n\n:''Dominance\u2013submissiveness'' refers to the emotional state that reflects the degree to which consumers and employees feel in control and able to act freely within the service environment.\n\n[[File:Woolworths Closing-down Sale, Grimsby - geograph.org.uk - 1076911.jpg|thumb|Crowded, disorganised, unpredictable environments are said to be high load.]]\n\nThe individual's emotional response mediate the individual's behavioural response of ''Approach\u2192 Avoidance.'' Approach refers to the act of physically moving towards something while avoidance interferes with people's ability to interact. In a service environment, approach behaviours might be characterised by a desire to explore an unfamiliar environment, remain in the service environment, interact with the environment and with other persons in the environment and a willingness to perform tasks within that environment. Avoid behaviours are characterised by a desire to leave the establishment, ignore the service environment, and feelings disappointment with the service experience. Environments in which people feel they lack control are unattractive. Customers often understand the concept of approach intuitively when they comment that a particular place \"looks inviting\". The desired level of emotional arousal depends on the situation. For example, at a gym arousal might be more important than pleasure (No Pain; No gain). In a leisure setting, pleasure might be more important. If the environment pleases, then the customer will be induced to stay longer and explore all that the service has to offer. Too much arousal can be counter-productive. For instance, a romantic couple might feel out of place in a busy, noisy and cluttered restaurant. Obviously, some level of arousal is necessary as a motivation to buy. The longer a customer stays in an environment, the greater the opportunities to cross-sell a range of service offerings.\n\nMehrabian and Russell identified two types of environment based on the degree of information processing and stimulation:<ref>Mehrabian,A. and Russell, J.A., ''An  Approach  to  Environmental  Psychology,'' Cambridge, MA, MIT  Press</ref>\n\n: ''High load'': Environments that are unfamiliar, novel, complex, unpredictable or crowded are high load\n\n: ''Low load'':  Environments that are familiar, simple, unsurprising and well organised are low load.\n\nActivities or tasks that are low load require a more stimulating environment for optimum performance. If the task to be performed in relatively simple, routine or boring then users benefit from a slightly more stimulating environment. On the other hand, tasks that are complex or difficult may benefit from a low load environment. In a service environment, a high load environment encourages patrons to enter and explore the various service offerings and spaces.\n\n===== Servicescapes=====\n{{See also|Servicescape}}\n \n[[File:Servicescapes.pdf|thumb|Simplified servicescapes model]]\n\nThe servicescapes model was developed by Mary Jo Bitner and published in 1992. It is an applied model, specifically developed to inform the analysis of service environments, and was influenced by both stimulus-response theory and environmental psychology.\n\n======Physical environment dimensions======\n\nAs the diagram of the servicescapes model illustrates, the service environment consists of physical environment dimensions which act as stimuli. Environmental simulis are normally considered as three broad categories including:<ref>Bitner, M.J., \"Servicescapes: The Impact of Physical Surroundings on Customers and Employees,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' vol. 56, no. 2, 1992, pp 57 -71</ref><ref>Katz, K.L. and Rossiter, J.,  \"Store Atmosphere: An Environmental Psychology Approach,\" in Bateson, J.E.G., ''Managing Services Marketing: Text, Cases and Readings'', Dryden, Orlando, Fl, 1991, pp 227-243</ref>\n\n: ''Ambient Conditions'': Temperature, air quality, ambient noise, lighting, background music, odor, etc\n\n: ''Space/ Function'': Equipment such as cash registers, layout, furnishings and furniture, etc\n\n: ''Signs, symbols & Artefacts'': Directional signage, personal artefacts (e.g. souvenirs, mementos), corporate livery and logos, style of d\u00e9cor (including colour schemes), symbols etc\n\n[[File:Savoy Boutique private seminar room - panoramio.jpg|thumb|The seminar room at the Savoy Hotel clearly signals an up-market positioning. Spacious room, high backed covered chairs, timber surfaces and a complementary bar combine to communicate that this in intended for corporate use.]]\n\nEach element in the physical environment serves specific roles -and some may perform multiple roles. Signage may provide information, but may also serve to assist customers navigate their way through a complex service environment. For instance, furnishings may serve a functional role in that they provide seating, but the construction materials, such as fabric, tapestry and velvet may serve a symbolic role. Plush fabrics and generous drapery may suggest an elegant, up-market venue, while plastic chairs may signify an inexpensive, family-friendly venue.  When evaluating the servicescape, the combined effect of all the elements must also be taken into consideration.\n\n======The holistic environment ======\nWhen consumers enter a servicescape, they scan the ambient conditions, layout, furnishings and artefacts and aggregate them to derive an overall ''impression'' of the environment. In other words, the ''holistic environment'' represents the cumulative effect of multiple stimuli, most of which are processed within a split second. These types of global judgments represent the summation of processing multiple stimuli to form a single, overall impression in the consumer's mind.<ref>Hoffman, K. D., Bateson, J. E.G., Elliot, G. and Birch, D., ''Service Marketing. Concepts, Strategies and Cases,'' Asia-Pacific Edition, Cengage Learning Australia, 2010, pp 209-215</ref>\n\n[[File:Seminar room, Singapore University of Technology and Design - 20150602-02.jpg|thumb|The seminar room at Singapore University clearly signals an institutional application. Functional seating, ceiling mounted projectors, whiteboard, fluorescent lighting and schoolroom layout combine to suggest that the space is part of a practical educational environment.]]\n\nThrough careful design of the physical environment and ambient conditions, managers are able to communicate the service firm's values and positioning. Ideally, the physical environment will be designed to achieve desired behavioural outcomes. Clever use of space can be used to encourage patrons to stay longer since longer stays result in more opportunities to sell services. At other times, the ambient conditions can be manipulated to encourage avoidance behaviour. For example, at the end of a busy night of trading, a bar manager might turn the air conditioning up, turn up the lights, turn off the background music and start stacking chairs on top of tables. These actions send a signal to patrons that it is closing time.\n\n======Customers and employees: moderating and mediating factors ======\n\nCustomers and employees represent the two groups that regularly inhabit the servicescape. Their perceptions of the environment are likely to differe, because each comes to the space with different purposes and motivations. For example, a waiter in a restaurant is likely to be pleased to see a crowded dining room because more customers means more tips. Customers, on the other hand, might be less pleased with a crowded space because the noise and queues have the potential to diminish the service experience.\n\nIn the servicescape model, a moderator is anything that changes the standard stimulus-response emotional states of pleasure-displeasure, arousal-non-arousal or dominance-submissiveness while the mediator explains the response behaviour, typically in terms of internal responses (cognitive, emotional and physiological responses).<ref>Hoffman, K.D. and Bateson, J.E. G., ''Services Marketing: Concepts, Strategies, & Cases,'' Cengage, 2017, p. 215</ref> The consumer's response to an environment depends, at least in part, on situational factors such as the purpose or reason for being in the environment.<ref>Bitner, M.J., \"Servicescapes: The Impact of Physical Surroundings on Customers and Employees,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' vol. 56, no. 2, 1992, pp 64-65</ref> For example, a waiter in a restaurant is likely to be pleased to see a crowded dining room because more customers means more tips. Customers, on the other hand, might be less pleased with a crowded space because the noise and queues have the potential to diminish the service experience.\n\n======Behavioural response======\n\nThe model shows that there are different types of response \u2013 individual response (''approach'' and ''avoid'')  and  interaction responses (e.g.''social interactions'').\n\nIn the context of servicescapes, ''approach'' has a special meaning.  It refers to how customers utilize the space, during and after the service encounter. Approach behaviours demonstrated during the encounter include:<ref>Bitner, M.J., \"Servicescapes: The Impact of Physical Surroundings on Customers and Employees,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' vol. 56, no. 2, 1992, pp 60-63</ref>\n\n: ''Enter and explore'' \u2013 exhibiting a desire to explore the total service offering, a willingness to do more things, keen to learn about all the company's products and services; showing an interest in [[cross-selling]] opportunities as presented\n\n: ''Stay longer'' \u2013 exhibiting a willingness to remain within the physical environment; longer stays present more opportunities for cross-selling, up-selling or impulse buying. Some studies have shown a correlation between length of stay and the size of average patron expenditure\n\n: ''Carry out plan'' \u2013 exhibiting a willingness to act on information provided, fully immerse themselves in the experience and a determination to achieve personal goals\n\n: ''Social interactions'' refer to customer-employee interactions as well as customer-customer interactions. In some services, such as clubs, bars and tours, the act of meeting other people and interacting with other customers forms an integral part of the service experience. Managers need to think about design features that can be used to facilitate interactions between patrons. For instance, some cafeterias and casual dining establishments install communal dining tables for the express purpose of encouraging customers to mix and socialise.\n\n[[File:CentralPark Vendor.JPG|thumb|Kiosks are lean servicescapes - simple, orderly, few employees, few spaces and familiar environments.]]\n\nDifferent types of approach behaviours demonstrated at the conclusion of the encounter or after the encounter may include: ''affiliation'' \u2013 a willingness to become a regular user, form intention to revisit; ''commitment'' \u2013 the formation of intention to become brand advocate, to provide referrals, write favourable online reviews or give positive word-of-mouth recommendations.\n\n======Types of servicescape======\n\nBitner's pioneering work on servicescapes identified two broad types of service environment:<ref>Bitner, M.J., \"Servicescapes: The Impact of Physical Surroundings on Customers and Employees,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' vol. 56, no. 2, 1992, pp 58-59</ref>\n[[File:Harrods Food Hall - geograph.org.uk - 908825.jpg|thumb|Department stores offer an elaborate servicescape with multiple levels and spaces, rich in physical elements and symbolism.]]\n: ''Lean servicescapes'' \u2013 environments that comprise relatively few spaces, contain few elements and involve few interactions between customers and employees. e.g. kiosks, vending machines, self-service retail outlets, fast food outlets. Designing lean environments is relatively straight-forward\n\n: ''Elaborate servicescapes'' \u2013 environments that comprise multiple spaces, are rich in physical elements and symbolism, involve high contact services with many interactions between customers and employees. Examples include international hotels and ocean liners with guest accommodation, concierge, bars, restaurants, swimming pools, gymnasiums and other supplementary services where guests interact with multiple personnel during their stay which might extend over multiple days. Designing elaborate environments requires skilled design teams who are fully apprised of the desired behavioural outcomes and the corporate vision.\n\nAccording to the model's developer, the servicescape acts like a \"product's package\" \u2013 by communicating a total image to customers and providing information about how to use the service. It can also serve as a point of difference by signalling which segments of the market are served, positioning the organisation and conveying competitive distinctiveness.<ref>Bitner, M.J., \"Servicescapes: The Impact of Physical Surroundings on Customers and Employees,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' vol. 56, no. 2, 1992, p. 67</ref>\n\n=== Service process===\n\nWhen customers enter a service firm they participate in a process. During that process, customers become quasi-employees; that is they are partial producers and they have the opportunity to see the organisation from the employee's perspective. To use a manufacturing analogy, customers are able to examine 'unfinished goods' \u2013 that is faulty and defective goods, glitches in the production system are in full view, with obvious implications for customer enjoyment and satisfaction. In addition, customers interactions with both employees and other customers becomes part of the total service experience with obvious implications for service quality and productivity.  Both customers and staff must be educated to effectively use the process. Controlling the service delivery process is more than a simple management issue. The customer's presence in the system means that the service process must be treated as a marketing issue.\n\n====Blueprinting for design and diagnosis====\n\n{{See also|Service blueprint}}\n\n[[File:Service blueprint.jpg|thumb|A service blueprint for a hypothetical fast food outlet]]\n\nBlueprinting is a technique designed to document the ''visible'' customer experience.<ref>Shostack, G. L., \"Service Positioning through Structural Change,\" ''Journal of Marketing'', vol. 51, no. 1, 1987, pp 34-43</ref> In its simplest form, the service blueprint is an applied process chart which shows the service delivery process from the customer's perspective. The original service blueprint is a highly visual, graphical map that delineates the key contact points in the service process and the nature of the contact \u2013 whether with physical evidence, personnel or procedures. It can be seen as a two dimensional map in which the horizontal axis represents time and the vertical axis represents the basic steps in the process.  A line of visibility is included to separate actions visible to the customer from actions out of sight.  Employee latitude, which refers to the amount of discretion given to employees to vary the service process, is shown on the map a call-out sign attached to the step a shown in the figure. Process complexity is shown simply by the number of steps in the process.\n\nIt was originally intended to be used as a tool to assist with service design and structural positioning.<ref>Shostack, G. Lynn. [http://hbr.org/1984/01/designing-services-that-deliver/ar/1 \"Designing Services that Deliver\"], ''Harvard Business Review'', vol. 62, no. 1 January - February 1984, pp 133\u2013139</ref>  However, since its inception it has been used extensively as a diagnostic tool, used to detect operational inefficiencies and potential trouble spots including ''fail points'' and ''bottlenecks''.<ref>Lovelock, C.

(2006), ''Services Marketing: Integrating Customer Focus Across the Firm'', 4th ed, Boston, MA, McGraw-Hill Irwin, 2006</ref>\n\nWhen interpreting service blueprints, there are two basic considerations, complexity and divergence. ''Complexity'' refers to the number and intricacy of the steps required to perform the service. ''Divergence'' refers to the degree of latitude, freedom, judgment, discretion, variability or situational adaptation permitted within any step of the process. \n                  \nManipulations of the blueprint diagram might include increasing complexity, by adding more steps, or increasing divergence by allowing employees greater latitude in varying each step. In general, service processes that include high levels of employee discretion to vary steps to meet the needs of individual customers are moving towards customisation. On the other hand, reducing divergence, by standardising each step, often adds to complexity, but can result in a production-line approach to service process design. By manipulating complexity and divergence, it is possible to envisage four different positioning strategies:<ref>Shostack, G.L., \"How to Design a Service,\" in Donnelly an, J.H. and George, W.R.

Like many fast food restaurants, Subway utilises a ''race'' to corral customers and move them in a one-way direction. Prominently displayed 'In' and 'Out' signage reinforces the direction of the desired traffic flow. Customers can peruse an overhead backlit menu while they are waiting in line which speeds up the order-taking process and reduces opportunities for bottlenecks. Other signage provides customers with information about the Subway process e.g. select bread, select filling, select sauce, pay and exit. The arrangement of food behind the glass counter not only displays the choice of sandwich fillings, but supports the process since customers must select their preferences in a specific sequence, as they inch their way towards the cash register. In Australia, the distinctive moves used by Subway customers as they shuffle along the race, selecting their sandwich breads and fillings has become affectionately known as the \u2018Subway shuffle'.<ref>''AdBrief'', [https://gotothesource.com.au/content/uploads/2013/02/ADB1792_pf.pdf \"Campaign News\"] [Australia], Issue no. 1792, 6 March 2009, p. 4</ref><ref>''AdNews'', [http://www.adnews.com.au/BC43A782-900D-4850-9710F17CDAB16B0D \"Daily Round-Up\"] 13 February 2009</ref> Every aspect of Subway's store design and layout reinforces the core objectives of customisation, volume-operations (i.e. rapid turnover) and operational efficiency.\n\n===People===\n\n{{See also|Customer experience|Internal communications}}\n\nThe ''people'' dimension refers to the human actors who are participants in the service encounter, namely employees and customers.<ref>Hoffman, D., Bateson, J.E.G., Elliot, G. and Birch, S., Services Marketing: Concepts, Strategies and Cases (Asia-Pacific ed.), Cengage, 2010, pp 226-274</ref> For many service marketers, the human interaction constitutes the heart of the service experience.<ref>Bateson, J. , ''Managing Services Marketing: Text, Cases and Readings,''  Orlando, Fl, Dryden, p. 7</ref> Service personnel are important because they are the ''face'' of the company and represent the company's values to customers. Customers are important because they are the reason for being in business and are the source of revenue.

Studies have shown that emotional labour can lead to undesirable consequences for employees including job-related stress, burnout, job dissatisfaction and withdrawal. If left untreated, these types of stressors can be very damaging to morale.\n\nManaging the behaviour of customers and employees in the service encounter is difficult. Consistent behaviour cannot be prescribed. It can, however, be nurtured in subtle and indirect ways.<ref>Harris, P.

This analogy is also known as a ''dramaturgical perspective.'' In such an analogy, service personnel are the ''actors'', customers are the ''audience''; uniforms are ''costumes''; the work setting is the ''stage'' (front-stage for areas where interaction occurs and ''back-stage'' for areas off limits to customers); discrete steps in the service process are ''scenes'' and finally the words and actions that occur represent the ''performance''.<ref>Grove, S.J., Fisk, R.P. and  John, J., \"Services as Theater: Guidelines and Implications,\"  in ''Handbook of Services Marketing and Management,'' Swartz, R., and Iacobucci, D (eds), Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage, 2000, pp 21-35</ref><ref>Grove, S.J., Fisk, R.P., [http://acrwebsite.org/volumes/7341/volumes/v19/NA-19 \"The Service Experience As Theater\"], in ''Advances in Consumer Research,'' Vol. 19, John F.

In this school of thought, service quality is conceptualised as consisting of two broad dimensions, namely:<ref>Gr\u00f6nroos, C., \"A service quality model and its marketing implications,\" ''European Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 18, No. 4, 1984, 36\u201344. doi:10.1108/EUM0000000004784</ref>\n\n: ''Technical quality'': (What was delivered) \n: ''Functional quality'': (How it was delivered)\n\nThe technical dimension can usually be measured \u2013 but the functional dimension is difficult to measure due to subjective interpretations which vary from customer to customer.<ref>Gr\u00f6nroos, C., ''Service Management and Marketing: Managing the Moments of Truth in Service Competition,'' Lexington, Mass: Lexington Books, 1990</ref>\n\n====The Gaps model====\n{{See also|SERVQUAL}}\n[[File:Servqual.jpg|thumb|The model of service quality]]\n\nThe model of service quality or the ''gaps model'' as it is popularly known, was developed by team of researchers, Parasuraman, Zeithaml and Berry, in the mid to late 1980s.<ref>Parasuraman, A, Ziethaml, V. and Berry, L.L., \"SERVQUAL: A Multiple- Item Scale for Measuring Consumer Perceptions of Service Quality' ''Journal of Retailing,'' Vol. 62,  no. 1, 1988, p. 25</ref> and has become the dominant approach for identifying service quality problems and diagnosing their probable causes.<ref>Ladhari, R., \"A Review of Twenty Years of SERVQUAL Research\", International Journal of Quality and Service Sciences, Vol. 1 no. 2, pp 172\u2013198</ref> This approach conceptualises service quality  as a gap between consumer's expectations of a forthcoming service encounter and their actual perceptions of that encounter.<ref>Zeithaml, V., Parasuraman, A. and Berry, L.L., ''Delivering Service Quality: Balancing Customer Perceptions and Expectations,'' N.Y., The Free Press, 1990</ref> Accordingly, service quality can be represented by the equation:<ref>Zeithaml, V.A., Berry, L.L. and Parasuraman, A., \"Communication and Control Processes in the Delivery of Service Quality,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 52, No. 2, 1988, pp. 35-48</ref>\n\n'''SQ = P- E'''\n: where;\n\n: '''SQ''' is service quality\n: '''P''' is the individual's perceptions of given service delivery\n: '''E''' is the individual's expectations of a given service delivery\n\nThe model which provides the overall conceptual framework helps analysts to identify the service quality gap (Gap 5 in the model) and to understand the probable causes of service quality related problems (Gaps 1-4 in the model). The diagnostic value of the model accounts at least, in part, for the instrument's continuing currency in service quality research.<ref>Asubonteng, P., McCleary, K.J. and Swan, J.E.,  \"SERVQUAL Revisited: A Critical Review of Service Quality\", ''Journal of Services Marketing,'' Vol. 10, no 6, 1996, pp 62-81</ref><ref>Ladhari, R., \"A review of twenty years of SERVQUAL research\", ''International Journal of Quality and Service Sciences,'' Vol. 1 no. 2, pp. 172\u2013198</ref><ref>Nyeck, S., Morales, M., Ladhari, R., & Pons, F., \"10 Years of Service Quality  Measurement: Reviewing the use of the SERVQUAL Instrument,\" ''Cuadernos de Difusion,'' Vol. 7, no 13, pp 101-107.</ref>\n\n[[File:Measuring service quality using SERVQUAL model (Kumar et al, 2009).png|thumb|The five dimensions of service quality]]\n\nThe model's developers also devised a research instrument, called SERVQUAL, to measure the size and direction of service quality problems (i.e. gap 5).<ref>Parasuraman, A., Berry, L.L. and Zeithaml, V.A.,  \"Refinement and Reassessment of the SERVQUAL scale,\" ''Journal of Retailing,'' Vol. 67, no. 4, 1991, pp 57-67</ref> The questionnaire is multi-dimensional instrument, designed to  having capture five dimensions of service quality; namely reliability, assurance, tangibles, empathy and responsiveness, which are believed to represent the consumer's understanding of service quality. The questionnaire consists of matched pairs of items; 22 expectation items and 22 perceptions items, organised into the five dimensions which align with the consumer's mental map of service quality dimensions. Both the expectations component and the perceptions component of the questionnaire consist a total of 22 items, comprising 4 items to capture tangibles, 5 items to capture reliability, 4 items for responsiveness, 5 items for assurance and 5 items to capture empathy.<ref>Based on Parasuraman, A, Ziethaml, V. and Berry, L.L., \"SERVQUAL: A Multiple- Item Scale for Measuring Consumer Perceptions of Service Quality' Journal of Retailing, Vol. 62, no. 1, 1988, [Appendix: SERVQUAL questionnaire, pp 37-40</ref> The questionnaire, which is designed to be administered in a face-to-face interview and requires a moderate to large size sample for statistical reliability, is lengthy and can take more than one hour to administer to reach respondent. In practice, researchers customarily add extra items to the 44 SERVQUAL items to capture information about the respondent's demographic profile, prior experience with the brand or category and behavioural intentions (intention to revisit/ repurchase, loyalty intentions and propensity to give word-of-mouth referrals). Thus, the final questionnaire may have up to 60 items, which contributes to substantial time and cost in terms of administration, coding and data analysis.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Summary of SERVQUAL questionnaire dimensions and items<ref>Based on Zeithaml, V., Parasuraman, A. and Berry, L.L., ''Delivering Service Quality: Balancing Customer Perceptions and Expectations,'' N.Y., The Free Press, 1990</ref>\n|-\n!

J. and Taylor, S. A., \"Measuring Service Quality: A Re-examination and Extension,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 56, no. 3, 1992 pp 55-68</ref> The scale is known as SERVPERF and is considerably shorter than SERVQUAL, and therefore easier and cheaper to administer. Results from the use of SERVPERF correlate well with SERVQUAL.<ref>Cronin J.J., Steven, J. and Taylor, A., \"SERVPERF versus SERVQUAL: Reconciling performance based and perceptions-minus-expectations measurement of service quality,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 58, January, 1994, pp 125-131</ref> This approach utilises a different conceptualisation of service quality, which can be represented by the equation:\n\n'''SQ = P'''\n: where;\n\n: '''SQ''' is service quality\n: '''P''' is the individual's perceptions of given service delivery\n\nAlthough SERVPERF has a number of advantages in terms of administration, it has attracted criticism. The performance only instrument lacks the diagnostic value of the SERVQUAL since it includes only one variable (P) compared to SERVQUAL's richer data with two variables (P and E).<ref>Elliott, K. M., \"SERVPERF versus SERVQUAL: A Marketing  Management Dilemma when Assessing Service Quality,\" ''Journal of Marketing Management,'' Vol. 4, no. 2, 1994, pp 56-61</ref><ref>Carrillat, F.A., Jaramillo, F. and Mulki, J.P., \"The Validity of the SERVQUAL and SERVPERF Scales: A Meta\u2010analytic View of 17 years of Research across Five Continents\", ''International Journal of Service Industry Management,'' Vol. 18, no. 5, 2007, pp 472-490</ref> To illustrate, consider one source of quality related problems which occurs when customers have unrealistically high expectations. SERVQUAL has no problem detecting such problems, however, SERVPERF can never detect this problem because it does not capture expectations. When choosing an appropriate instrument for investigations into service quality, service marketers must weigh up the expediency of SERVPERF against the diagnostic power of SERVQUAL.\n\n==Services dominant logic: implications for theory and practice==\n{{See also|Service-dominant logic}}\n\nService-dominant logic (SDL) is a new way of thinking about marketing, especially the goods versus services division and especially a fresh way of thinking about customer value and the value-creation process. Vargo and Lusch did not intend for service-dominant logic to be published as a workable theory that offers solutions to everyday marketing problems and issues. Instead, it offers a framework for thinking about goods and services. Their work did not put forward hypotheses that could be tested empirically, Instead they offer \"foundational propositions.\"  The original article offered eight such propositions<ref>Vargo, S. L. and Lusch, R.F., \"Evolving to a New Dominant Logic for Marketing,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' vol 68, no. 1, 2004, pp 1-17.</ref> and subsequently added two more propositions to arrive at a total of ten:<ref>Vargo, S. L. and Robert F. Lusch, \"Service-dominant Logic: Continuing the Evolution\",  ''Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science,'' Vol. 36, no. 1, 2008, pp 1-10</ref>\n\nSome of the implications that have been identified in the literature include:\n\n''SDL offers the promise of a unified marketing theory'': To date, marketing research and practice have failed to integrate the traditional goods/services dichotomy. Some efforts have been made to get product accepted as a joint term for goods and services and to use offering, package or solution as all inclusive, concepts for what consumers the buys, but this has not been successful.<ref>Gummesson, E., \"Exit Services Marketing- Enter Service Marketing,\" in: Michael Baker and Susan Hart (eds), ''The Marketing Book'', 6th edition, Butterworth-Heinemann, 2008, pp 451-471</ref> Service-dominant logic, however, promises a truly unified framework. For many academics, this is the most exciting implication. It is highly likely that the 4 Ps, as the central marketing framework, is about to come to a close.\n\n''Compete Through Innovative Co-production and Co-creation'': Some theorists point out that, thanks largely to the Internet, consumers have been actively engaging themselves in explicit dialogue with manufacturers and service providers.<ref>Prahalad, C.K. and Ramaswamy, V. (2000) \"Co-opting Customer Competence,\" ''Harvard Business Review,'' vol. 78, no. 1, pp 79-87</ref> The challenge is for service firms to find innovative ways to achieve co-production and co-creation. Customer co-creation has become the foundation concept for social sharing web sites such as YouTube, Myspace and Twitter.  Many companies have moved from testing products in the contrived and artificial conditions of a laboratory to product testing in customer environments. At Microsoft, for example, consumers acted as product researchers by testing Windows 2000 in their native environments. A different approach is to use embedded intelligence to provide enhanced personalised experiences.\n\n''Research Priorities'': SDL has forced the discipline to review its research priorities.  Researchers and scholars are beginning to identify a range of subjects that require more detailed exploration. Some theorists have argued that marketing practitioners must find new ways of understanding customers' value creation and of developing marketing strategies with an aim to engage suppliers with their customers' consumption processes in order to enhance customer satisfaction.<ref>Vargo, S.L., \"Customer Integration and Value Creation: Paradigmatic Traps and Perspectives,\" ''Journal of Service Research,'' vol. 11, no. 2, 2008, pp 211-215.</ref> Other research priorities include: the personalised customer experience,<ref>Lusch, R.F., Vargo, S.L. and O'Brien, M., \"Competing through Service: Insights from Service-dominant Logic,\" ''Journal of Retailing,'' Vol. 83, no. 1, 2007, pp 5-18</ref> resource integration,<ref>Baron, S.  and Harris, K. \"Consumers as Resource Integrators,\" ''Journal of Marketing Management,'' vol. 24, no. 1/2, 2008, p113-130</ref> improved use of IT to map processes and activities in order to increase productivity and standardise service.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Consumer behaviour]]\n* [[Customer experience]]\n* [[Destination marketing]]\n* [[Industrialization of services business model]]\n* [[Service blueprint]]\n* [[Service design]]\n* [[Service quality]]\n* [[Service system]]\n* [[Servicescape]]s\n* [[Service-dominant logic]]\n* [[Servitization of products business model]]\n* [[SERVQUAL]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Alan Wilson, Valarie Zeithaml, Mary Jo Bitner and Dwayne D.
