A pair of harpy eagles usually only raises one chick every 2\u20133&nbsp;years. After the first chick hatches, the second egg is ignored and normally fails to hatch unless the first egg perishes. The egg is incubated around 56&nbsp;days. When the chick is 36&nbsp;days old, it can stand and walk awkwardly. The chick fledges at the age of 6&nbsp;months, but the parents continue to feed it for another 6 to 10&nbsp;months. The male captures much of the food for the incubating female and later the eaglet, but also takes an incubating shift while the female forages and also brings prey back to the nest.

A pair of harpy eagles usually only raises one chick every 2\u20133&nbsp;years. After the first chick hatches, the second egg is ignored and normally fails to hatch unless the first egg perishes. The egg is incubated around 56&nbsp;days. When the chick is 36&nbsp;days old, it can stand and walk awkwardly. The chick fledges at the age of 6&nbsp;months, but the parents continue to feed it for another 6 to 10&nbsp;months. The male captures much of the food for the incubating female and later the eaglet, but also takes an incubating shift while the female forages and also brings prey back to the nest. Breeding maturity is not reached until birds are 4 to 6&nbsp;years of age.<ref name=RaptorsWorld/><ref name=Rettig1978/><ref name=\"Remote\"/> Adults can be aggressive toward humans who disturb the nesting site or appear to be a threat to its young.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jul/06/harpy-eagle-attack-cameraman | newspaper=guardian.co.uk | author=Vaughan, Adam |date=July 6, 2010| title=Monkey-eating eagle divebombs BBC filmmaker as he fits nest-cam }}</ref>\n\n==Status and conservation==\n[[File:Harpia harpyja -Belize Zoo-8-3c.jpg|right|thumb|Subadult, \"Panama\", in [[Belize Zoo]]]]\nAlthough the harpy eagle still occurs over a considerable range, its distribution and populations have dwindled considerably.

Stregobor lures Geralt to his hideout seeking to hire him to kill Renfri, but Geralt refuses. Renfri later offers Geralt a counter-proposal, but he refuses with an ultimatum: leave or die. She feigns agreement, but upon waking up the next morning, Geralt realizes Renfri will not stop until Stregobor is dead, and he rushes to stop her. After killing her men, he fights and fatally wounds Renfri, and her dying words told him of a girl in the forest who is his destiny forever. Stregobor arrives to take Renfri's body for autopsy. When Geralt opposes, the townsfolk force him to leave, urged on by Stregobor. In 1263, The kingdom of Cintra is conquered by southern neighbor Nilfgaard, and Princess Cirilla, also known as Ciri, is sent away by her grandmother, Queen Calanthe, to escape and find Geralt. Cirilla is captured by Nilfgaardian officer Cahir, but the sight of the burning city and castle trigger her powers, allowing her to escape.\n{{hr}}\nBased on \"The Lesser Evil\" from ''The Last Wish''.<ref name=\"gamespot\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-books-reading-order-and-which-stories-/2900-3331/|title=The Witcher Books: Reading Order And Which Stories Inspired The Netflix Show|work=Gamespot|first=Michael|last=Rougeau|date=2019-12-23|accessdate=2019-12-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191226231028/https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-books-reading-order-and-which-stories-/2900-3331/|archive-date=December 26, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n| LineColor       = 515357\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 2\n| Title           = Four Marks\n| DirectedBy      = Alik Sakharov\n| WrittenBy       = Jenny Klein\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|12|20}}\n| ShortSummary    = In 1206, Hunchback Yennefer from Vengerberg of Aedirn is sold to Tissaia de Vries by her father. She is taken to Aretuza for training in magic, but finds difficulty in the practice. She makes a friendship with Istredd, even revealing her quarter-[[elf]] heritage, a cause of her deformity. Unbeknownst to either, Tissaia and Stregobor were using Yennefer and Istredd respectively to spy on each other. Later, Yennefer witnesses Tissaia turning three students into eels to act as conduits powering Aretuza with magic. In 1240, Geralt is hired to investigate grain thefts in Posada and is followed by Jaskier the bard. They encounter a [[Silvanus (mythology)|Sylvan]] named Torque, who knocks them unconscious and takes them to his mountain cave. There, Geralt meets Filavandrel, the elven king and urges he lead his people to better lands after being banished by the humans. Instead of killing them, Filavandrel frees Geralt and Jaskier, taking the former's words to heart. In 1263, Cirilla encounters Dara, a boy in the woods, who guides her to a refugee camp. Dara returns to save her as the camp is attacked by Cahir's forces, and she later realizes Dara is an elf.\n{{hr}}\nBased on \"The Edge of the World\" from ''The Last Wish''.<ref name=\"gamespot\"/>\n| LineColor       = 515357\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 3\n| Title           = Betrayer Moon\n| DirectedBy      = Alex Garcia Lopez\n| WrittenBy       = Beau DeMayo\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|12|20}}\n| ShortSummary    = In 1210, Yennefer and Istredd become lovers while finishing their training. While Yennefer has the chance to transform her body into her ideal image during graduation, the Brotherhood of Sorcerers discuss the allocation of their newly initiated to their respective kingdoms. But through Stregobor's scheme, Yennefer is assigned to Nilfgaard instead of her preferred Aedirn due to her elven blood. Realizing what happened, Yennefer angrily breaks up with Istredd, knowing only he could have told Stregobor about her blood. Having missed graduation, Yennefer undergoes the painful transformation to be beautiful at the cost of her fertility. Wearing her new body, Yennefer charms Aedirn's King Virfuril into taking her as advisor, sending Fringilla to Nilfgaard instead. In 1243, Geralt enters the kingdom of Temeria to investigate a monster, assisted by Triss Merigold, King Foltest's sorceress advisor. He identifies the monster as a [[Shtriga]], a creature born from a curse he later discovers was placed by the [[courtier]] Ostrit who learned about the [[incest|affair]] between Foltest and his sister, Princess Adda. Using Ostrit as bait, Geralt battles to contain the shtriga until dawn, which lifts the curse.

The assassin follows them through multiple portals, killing Kalis. Although Yennefer escapes with Kalis's newborn daughter, the baby dies from a thrown dagger. In 1249, Geralt accompanies Jaskier to the betrothal feast of Princess Pavetta, Queen Calanthe's daughter. Urcheon of Erlenwald (also named Duny) interrupts to demand Pavetta's hand through the Law of Surprise, having saved her father years earlier. Urcheon suffers from a curse that transformed him into a hedgehog/man creature. Despite Pavetta's acceptance, Calanthe refuses and a brawl ensues. When Calanthe tries killing Urcheon, Pavetta activates her power, unleashing a maelstrom until Geralt and Mousesack intervene. Wanting her daughter happy, Calanthe marries Duny and Pavetta, which lifts Duny's curse. Duny, thankful for Geralt's aid, insists he take a reward, so Geralt jokingly invokes the Law of Surprise for something Duny has but doesn't yet know. The crowd then immediately learns Pavetta is pregnant with Duny's child. In 1263, Nilfgaard's forces resume their pursuit of Cirilla with Mousesack as their prisoner. Meanwhile, Cirilla and Dara encounter Queen Eithne and her Dryads in Brokilon Forest, while Cahir and Fringilla track Ciri's location.\n{{hr}}\nBased on \"A Question of Price\" from ''The Last Wish'', and \"Sword of Destiny\" from ''Sword of Destiny''.<ref name=\"gamespot\"/>\n| LineColor       = 515357\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 5\n| Title           = Bottled Appetites\n| DirectedBy      = [[Charlotte Br\u00e4ndstr\u00f6m]]\n| WrittenBy       = Sneha Koorse\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|12|20}}\n| ShortSummary    = Seven years after Pavetta's betrothal, in 1256, Geralt and Jaskier discover a [[Jinn|Djinn]] and accidentally release it. Initially, it seems that Jaskier is the Djinn's 'master' but then he falls seriously ill. Geralt seeks help from the nearest healer, the elf Chireadan, but as they need a mage to heal Jaskier, Chireadan reluctantly refers them to Yennefer. Although Yennefer cures Jaskier, her plan is to use him to capture the Djinn to grant her wish of regaining her fertility. As Jaskier uses his last wish, nothing happens and it's revealed that it is Geralt, not Jaskier, who actually has the wishes. Geralt realises the Djinn will kill Yennefer, so he uses his third and final wish to save her (but the wish itself is not revealed). The Djinn leaves. Now free and safe, Geralt and Yennefer act on their attraction and have sex. Yennefer asks what his third wish was, but Geralt does not answer as he has finally fallen asleep. In 1263, Cahir hires a doppler to assume the identity of Mousesack by copying his form and memories, then kills him.

After camping overnight, the party finds the knight dead and the Reavers have departed. The dwarves take their party to a mountain shortcut, but the bridge gives way. Borch's group sacrifices themselves rather than endanger the party. Geralt and Yennefer reconcile before reaching the dragon's den, but find it dead with T\u00e9a and V\u00e9a alive guarding the dragon's egg. Borch reveals himself as Vilentretenmerth, a golden dragon. The five of them defend the egg from the Reavers. Borch later pays off the dwarves with dragon teeth, and Geralt reveals to Yennefer his third wish bound their fates together. Believing her feelings for Geralt to be artificial, Yennefer declares that she can't be with him and leaves.

Stregobor lures Geralt to his hideout seeking to hire him to kill Renfri, but Geralt refuses. Renfri later offers Geralt a counter-proposal, but he refuses with an ultimatum: leave or die. She feigns agreement, but upon waking up the next morning, Geralt realizes Renfri will not stop until Stregobor is dead, and he rushes to stop her. After killing her men, he fights and fatally wounds Renfri, and her dying words told him of a girl in the forest who is his destiny forever. Stregobor arrives to take Renfri's body for autopsy. When Geralt opposes, the townsfolk force him to leave, urged on by Stregobor. In 1263, The kingdom of Cintra is conquered by southern neighbor Nilfgaard, and Princess Cirilla, also known as Ciri, is sent away by her grandmother, Queen Calanthe, to escape and find Geralt. Cirilla is captured by Nilfgaardian officer Cahir, but the sight of the burning city and castle trigger her powers, allowing her to escape.\n{{hr}}\nBased on \"The Lesser Evil\" from ''The Last Wish''.<ref name=\"gamespot\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-books-reading-order-and-which-stories-/2900-3331/|title=The Witcher Books: Reading Order And Which Stories Inspired The Netflix Show|work=Gamespot|first=Michael|last=Rougeau|date=2019-12-23|accessdate=2019-12-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191226231028/https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-books-reading-order-and-which-stories-/2900-3331/|archive-date=December 26, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n| LineColor       = 515357\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 2\n| Title           = Four Marks\n| DirectedBy      = Alik Sakharov\n| WrittenBy       = Jenny Klein\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|12|20}}\n| ShortSummary    = In 1206, Hunchback Yennefer from Vengerberg of Aedirn is sold to Tissaia de Vries by her father. She is taken to Aretuza for training in magic, but finds difficulty in the practice. She makes a friendship with Istredd, even revealing her quarter-[[elf]] heritage, a cause of her deformity. Unbeknownst to either, Tissaia and Stregobor were using Yennefer and Istredd respectively to spy on each other. Later, Yennefer witnesses Tissaia turning three students into eels to act as conduits powering Aretuza with magic. In 1240, Geralt is hired to investigate grain thefts in Posada and is followed by Jaskier the bard. They encounter a [[Silvanus (mythology)|Sylvan]] named Torque, who knocks them unconscious and takes them to his mountain cave. There, Geralt meets Filavandrel, the elven king and urges he lead his people to better lands after being banished by the humans. Instead of killing them, Filavandrel frees Geralt and Jaskier, taking the former's words to heart. In 1263, Cirilla encounters Dara, a boy in the woods, who guides her to a refugee camp. Dara returns to save her as the camp is attacked by Cahir's forces, and she later realizes Dara is an elf.\n{{hr}}\nBased on \"The Edge of the World\" from ''The Last Wish''.<ref name=\"gamespot\"/>\n| LineColor       = 515357\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 3\n| Title           = Betrayer Moon\n| DirectedBy      = Alex Garcia Lopez\n| WrittenBy       = Beau DeMayo\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|12|20}}\n| ShortSummary    = In 1210, Yennefer and Istredd become lovers while finishing their training. While Yennefer has the chance to transform her body into her ideal image during graduation, the Brotherhood of Sorcerers discuss the allocation of their newly initiated to their respective kingdoms. But through Stregobor's scheme, Yennefer is assigned to Nilfgaard instead of her preferred Aedirn due to her elven blood. Realizing what happened, Yennefer angrily breaks up with Istredd, knowing only he could have told Stregobor about her blood. Having missed graduation, Yennefer undergoes the painful transformation to be beautiful at the cost of her fertility. Wearing her new body, Yennefer charms Aedirn's King Virfuril into taking her as advisor, sending Fringilla to Nilfgaard instead. In 1243, Geralt enters the kingdom of Temeria to investigate a monster, assisted by Triss Merigold, King Foltest's sorceress advisor. He identifies the monster as a [[Shtriga]], a creature born from a curse he later discovers was placed by the [[courtier]] Ostrit who learned about the [[incest|affair]] between Foltest and his sister, Princess Adda. Using Ostrit as bait, Geralt battles to contain the shtriga until dawn, which lifts the curse.

The assassin follows them through multiple portals, killing Kalis. Although Yennefer escapes with Kalis's newborn daughter, the baby dies from a thrown dagger. In 1249, Geralt accompanies Jaskier to the betrothal feast of Princess Pavetta, Queen Calanthe's daughter. Urcheon of Erlenwald (also named Duny) interrupts to demand Pavetta's hand through the Law of Surprise, having saved her father years earlier. Urcheon suffers from a curse that transformed him into a hedgehog/man creature. Despite Pavetta's acceptance, Calanthe refuses and a brawl ensues. When Calanthe tries killing Urcheon, Pavetta activates her power, unleashing a maelstrom until Geralt and Mousesack intervene. Wanting her daughter happy, Calanthe marries Duny and Pavetta, which lifts Duny's curse. Duny, thankful for Geralt's aid, insists he take a reward, so Geralt jokingly invokes the Law of Surprise for something Duny has but doesn't yet know. The crowd then immediately learns Pavetta is pregnant with Duny's child. In 1263, Nilfgaard's forces resume their pursuit of Cirilla with Mousesack as their prisoner. Meanwhile, Cirilla and Dara encounter Queen Eithne and her Dryads in Brokilon Forest, while Cahir and Fringilla track Ciri's location.\n{{hr}}\nBased on \"A Question of Price\" from ''The Last Wish'', and \"Sword of Destiny\" from ''Sword of Destiny''.<ref name=\"gamespot\"/>\n| LineColor       = 515357\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 5\n| Title           = Bottled Appetites\n| DirectedBy      = [[Charlotte Br\u00e4ndstr\u00f6m]]\n| WrittenBy       = Sneha Koorse\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|12|20}}\n| ShortSummary    = Seven years after Pavetta's betrothal, in 1256, Geralt and Jaskier discover a [[Jinn|Djinn]] and accidentally release it. Initially, it seems that Jaskier is the Djinn's 'master' but then he falls seriously ill. Geralt seeks help from the nearest healer, the elf Chireadan, but as they need a mage to heal Jaskier, Chireadan reluctantly refers them to Yennefer. Although Yennefer cures Jaskier, her plan is to use him to capture the Djinn to grant her wish of regaining her fertility. As Jaskier uses his last wish, nothing happens and it's revealed that it is Geralt, not Jaskier, who actually has the wishes. Geralt realises the Djinn will kill Yennefer, so he uses his third and final wish to save her (but the wish itself is not revealed). The Djinn leaves. Now free and safe, Geralt and Yennefer act on their attraction and have sex. Yennefer asks what his third wish was, but Geralt does not answer as he has finally fallen asleep. In 1263, Cahir hires a doppler to assume the identity of Mousesack by copying his form and memories, then kills him.

After camping overnight, the party finds the knight dead and the Reavers have departed. The dwarves take their party to a mountain shortcut, but the bridge gives way. Borch's group sacrifices themselves rather than endanger the party. Geralt and Yennefer reconcile before reaching the dragon's den, but find it dead with T\u00e9a and V\u00e9a alive guarding the dragon's egg. Borch reveals himself as Vilentretenmerth, a golden dragon. The five of them defend the egg from the Reavers. Borch later pays off the dwarves with dragon teeth, and Geralt reveals to Yennefer his third wish bound their fates together. Believing her feelings for Geralt to be artificial, Yennefer declares that she can't be with him and leaves. Hurt, Geralt snaps at Jaskier, blaming him for all of his misfortunes and hopes that they never meet again.

The test used was [[Fisher's exact test]].\n\n== The experiment ==\n\nThe experiment provides a subject with 8 randomly ordered cups of tea &ndash; 4 prepared by first pouring the tea, then adding milk, 4 prepared by first pouring the milk, then adding the tea. The subject has to select 4 cups prepared by one method. Judging cups by direct comparison is allowed. The method employed in the experiment is fully disclosed to the subject.\n\nThe [[null hypothesis]] is that the subject has no ability to distinguish the teas. In Fisher's approach, there was no [[alternative hypothesis]],{{sfn|Fisher|1971|loc=Chapter II. The Principles of Experimentation, Illustrated by a Psycho-physical Experiment, Section 8. The Null Hypothesis}} unlike in the [[Neyman\u2013Pearson lemma|Neyman\u2013Pearson approach]].\n\nThe test statistic is a simple count of the number of successes in selecting the 4 cups (the number of cups of the given type successfully selected). The distribution of possible numbers of successes, assuming the null hypothesis is true, can be computed using the number of combinations. Using the [[combination]] formula, with <math>n=8</math> total cups and <math>k=4</math> cups chosen, there are\n:<math>\\binom{8}{4} = \\frac{8!}{4!(8-4)!} = 70</math>\npossible combinations.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Tea-Tasting Distribution Assuming the Null Hypothesis\n! scope=\"col\" | Success count\n! scope=\"col\" | Combinations of selection\n! scope=\"col\" | Number of Combinations\n|-\n| 0 || oooo || 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n|-\n| 1 || ooox, ooxo, oxoo, xooo || 4 \u00d7 4 = 16\n|-\n| 2 || ooxx, oxox, oxxo, xoxo, xxoo, xoox || 6 \u00d7 6 = 36\n|-\n| 3 || oxxx, xoxx, xxox, xxxo || 4 \u00d7 4 = 16\n|-\n| 4 || xxxx || 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" scope=\"row\" | Total\n| 70\n|}\n\nThe frequencies of the possible numbers of successes, given in the final column of this table, are derived as follows. For 0 successes, there is clearly only one set of four choices (namely, choosing all four incorrect cups) giving this result. For one success and three failures, there are four correct cups of which one is selected, which by the [[combination]] formula can occur in <math>\\binom 41 =4</math> different ways (as shown in column 2, with ''x'' denoting a correct cup that is chosen and ''o'' denoting a correct cup that is not chosen); and independently of that, there are four incorrect cups of which three are selected, which can occur in <math>\\binom 43 = 4</math> ways (as shown in the second column, this time with ''x'' interpreted as an incorrect cup which is not chosen, and ''o'' indicating an incorrect cup which is chosen). Thus a selection of any one correct cup and any three incorrect cups can occur in any of 4\u00d74 = 16 ways. The frequencies of the other possible numbers of successes are calculated correspondingly. Thus the number of successes is distributed according to the [[hypergeometric distribution]]. The distribution of combinations for making ''k'' selections out of the ''2k'' available selections corresponds to the ''k''th row of Pascal's triangle, such that each integer in the row is squared. In this case, <math>k = 4</math> because 4 teacups are selected from the 8 available teacups.\n\nThe critical region for rejection of the null of no ability to distinguish was the single case of 4 successes of 4 possible, based on the conventional probability criterion <&nbsp;5%. This is the critical region because under the null of no ability to distinguish, 4 successes has 1 chance out of 70 (\u2248&nbsp;1.4% < 5%) of occurring, whereas at least 3 of 4 successes has a probability of (16+1)/70 (\u2248&nbsp;24.3% > 5%).\n\nThus, if and only if the lady properly categorized all 8 cups was Fisher willing to reject the null hypothesis &ndash; effectively acknowledging the lady's ability at a 1.4% significance level (but without quantifying her ability). Fisher later discussed the benefits of more trials and repeated tests.\n\n[[David Salsburg]] reports that a colleague of Fisher, [[H.
