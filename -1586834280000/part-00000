The B&O completed its [[Metropolitan Subdivision|Metropolitan Branch]] in 1873; most service from Martinsburg and Frederick was diverted onto the Metropolitan Branch to Washington and the old main line became a secondary route. This established the basic route for what would become the [[Brunswick Line]].\n\nThe [[Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad]] (PW&B) completed its line between Baltimore and Philadelphia in December 1838, save for the ferry across the [[Susquehanna River]], which was not bridged until the 1860s. Although the B&O was chartered with the unspoken assumption that no competing line would be built between Baltimore and Washington, the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]-owned [[Baltimore and Potomac Railroad]] (B&P) was completed between the two cities in 1872.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mdot.maryland.gov/Office_of_Planning_and_Capital_Programming/Plans_Programs_Reports/Historical_Documents/Southern_Maryland_Commuter_Service_Technical_Memorandum_07282009.pdf |title=Southern Maryland Commuter Rail Service Feasibility Study |date=August 2009 |publisher=Maryland Transit Administration}}</ref> The PW&B was initially hostile to the Pennsylvania (PRR); however, the PRR acquired it in a stock battle with the B&O in 1881.

The bidding process was suspended in the fall of 2010 due to lack of competition. Before bidding reopened in 2011, Maryland passed a law (at the request of Leo Bretholz and other [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivors) requiring Keolis's majority owner, French state railway company [[SNCF]],<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/06/AR2010070605169_2.html?sid=ST2010070605786 |title=Holocaust group faults VRE contract |last=Shaver |first=Katherine |date=July 7, 2010 |work=The Washington Post}}</ref> to fully disclose its role in transporting Jews to concentration camps during [[World War II]] (while SNCF was under control of the Nazi government). This disclosure would need to meet the satisfaction of the Maryland state archivist before Keolis would be allowed to place a bid for MARC service.

An additional 1200 railway workers were themselves sent to concentration camps over SNCF rails. Phillips also notes that SNCF does business with the [[Israel Railways|Israel rail system]] and works without government prompting to educate the current generation about the war and Holocaust.\n\nIn June 2011, the future of Keolis's ability to bid on the MARC contract remained up in the air with the new disclosure law in place. No other bidder had emerged to replace CSXT. On June 5, 2011, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' ran an editorial critical of the disclosure law. The Post claimed that SNCF has been working for years on digitizing its records, and the Maryland law may require items or formats counter to SNCF's current system and/or French law. The article also stated that some in the Maryland Attorney General's Office worried the law was not Constitutional, may risk retaliation towards Maryland firms overseas, and may risk federal funding for Maryland \"by imposing arbitrary procurement demands on a single company.\"<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/no-way-to-run-a-railroad/2011/06/03/AGk2gmJH_story.html |title=No way to run a railroad |last=Lind |first=Michael |date=June 5, 2011 |work=The Washington Post}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.jewishtimes.com/index.php/jewishtimes/news/jt/local_news/state_archivist_sncf_archives_might_not_be_enough/29884 |title=State archivist SNCF archives might not be enough |last=Rubin |first=Neil |date=February 10, 2012 |work=Baltimore Jewish Times}}</ref>\n\nMTA issued a new Request for Proposals for the operations and maintenance of MARC services on the Brunswick and Camden Lines on July 14, 2011, with a deadline for proposals on November 21, 2011.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.masstransitmag.com/news/10454236/md-mta-keolis-mum-on-bids-to-run-marc-lines |title=MD MTA Keolis mum on bids to run MARC lines |last=Sohr |first=Nicholas |date=November 21, 2011 |work=The Daily Record via masstransitmag.com}}</ref> On October 17, 2012, a $204 million contract to run the Camden and Brunswick lines was awarded to the [[Canada|Canadian]] company [[Bombardier Transportation]],<ref name=\"Weir\">{{Cite news |url=http://washingtonexaminer.com/bombardier-wins-204m-marc-commuter-train-contract/article/2511058#.UI1WIWe_Msc |title=Bombardier wins $204m MARC commuter train contract |last=Weir |first=Kytja |date=October 17, 2012 |work=[[The Washington Examiner]] |access-date=October 28, 2012}}</ref> effectively ending the Keolis controversy.

The collision occurred at Georgetown Junction on a snow-swept stretch of track just west of [[Silver Spring, Maryland]]. The crash left 11 people dead aboard the MARC train. Three died of injuries suffered in the impact alone, with the rest succumbing to the ensuing smoke and flames or a combination of the two. Engineer Ricky Orr and conductors Jimmy Major Jr. and Jim Quillen were among the victims. Eight Jobs Corps students also were killed during the accident.\n\nThe NTSB report concluded that the MARC crew apparently forgot the approach signal [[Railway signal#Aspects and indications|aspect]] of the Kensington [[Railway signal#Colour-position signals|color-position signal]] after making a [[Request stop|flag stop]] at [[Kensington station (Maryland)|Kensington station]]. The MARC train was operating in [[Push-pull train|push]] mode with the cab control car out front. The Amtrak locomotives were in the crossover at the time of the collision; the MARC cab control car collided with the lead Amtrak unit, [[EMD F40PH|F40PH]] #255, rupturing its fuel tank and igniting the fire that caused most of the casualties. The second unit was a [[GE Genesis#P40DC|GE Genesis P40DC]] #811, a newer unit that has a fuel tank that is shielded in the center of the frame. The official investigation also suggests that the accident might have been prevented if a [[human reliability|human-factors analysis]] had been conducted when modifications to the track signaling system were made in 1992 with the closing of nearby QN tower.\n\n===2008===\nOn February 7, 2008, a train derailed at Union Station after it was hit by an Amtrak [[switcher]] locomotive.

With the area population growing and the [[Base Realignment and Closure|BRAC]] process poised to bring new jobs to [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]] and [[Fort George G. Meade|Ft. Meade]], both near MARC stations, the state saw the need to expand service. In September 2007, MTA Maryland unveiled an ambitious 30-year plan of system improvements.

The collision occurred at Georgetown Junction on a snow-swept stretch of track just west of [[Silver Spring, Maryland]]. The crash left 11 people dead aboard the MARC train. Three died of injuries suffered in the impact alone, with the rest succumbing to the ensuing smoke and flames or a combination of the two. Engineer Ricky Orr and conductors Jimmy Major Jr. and Jim Quillen were among the victims. Eight Jobs Corps students also were killed during the accident.\n\nThe NTSB report concluded that the MARC crew apparently forgot the approach signal [[Railway signal#Aspects and indications|aspect]] of the Kensington [[Railway signal#Colour-position signals|color-position signal]] after making a [[Request stop|flag stop]] at [[Kensington station (Maryland)|Kensington station]]. The MARC train was operating in [[Push-pull train|push]] mode with the cab control car out front. The Amtrak locomotives were in the crossover at the time of the collision; the MARC cab control car collided with the lead Amtrak unit, [[EMD F40PH|F40PH]] #255, rupturing its fuel tank and igniting the fire that caused most of the casualties. The second unit was a [[GE Genesis#P40DC|GE Genesis P40DC]] #811, a newer unit that has a fuel tank that is shielded in the center of the frame. The official investigation also suggests that the accident might have been prevented if a [[human reliability|human-factors analysis]] had been conducted when modifications to the track signaling system were made in 1992 with the closing of nearby QN tower.\n\n===2008===\nOn February 7, 2008, a train derailed at Union Station after it was hit by an Amtrak [[switcher]] locomotive. The train was still unloading passengers at the time of impact, and seven people received minor head and neck injuries. The Amtrak locomotive was attempting to couple to the train and was reportedly moving too fast.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n===2010===\nTwo significant events in 2010 received official response.\n\nOn June 21, 2010, northbound Amtrak-operated Penn Line train 538 broke down at 6:23&nbsp;p.m. Temperatures inside the train reached {{Convert|100|F|}} due to malfunctioning air conditioning. After passengers called 911, 10 people were treated at the scene for heat-related problems. All passengers were cleared from the scene by 9:40&nbsp;pm.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/22/AR2010062203752.html?wprss=rss_metro/md |title=900 riders stuck on MARC train for more than two hours with no air conditioning |last=Shaver |first=Katherine |date=June 23, 2010 |work=The Washington Post |access-date=June 30, 2010}}</ref> This incident prompted MDOT Secretary Beverley Swaim-Staley to apologize to the affected customers on June 27, 2010.\n\nOn June 28, 2010, an Amtrak engineer operating a MARC train overran a scheduled stop in {{marc|Odenton}}, without notice to passengers.

With the area population growing and the [[Base Realignment and Closure|BRAC]] process poised to bring new jobs to [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]] and [[Fort George G. Meade|Ft. Meade]], both near MARC stations, the state saw the need to expand service. In September 2007, MTA Maryland unveiled an ambitious 30-year plan of system improvements. Though funding sources had not been established at that time, the plan represented the state's goals of increasing capacity and flexibility. Proposed improvements included:<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mtamaryland.com/marc%20plan%20full.pdf |title=MARC Growth & Investment Plan |date=September 2007 |publisher=MTA Maryland |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227000614/http://www.mtamaryland.com/marc%20plan%20full.pdf |archive-date=February 27, 2009 |url-status=dead |access-date=February 16, 2010 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n  \n*Acquisition of new equipment. 54 Bombardier MultiLevels were ordered to replace aging single-level cars.\n*Weekend service on the Penn Line. Service began on December 7, 2013, between Baltimore and Washington, D.C., with some trips extending to Martin State Airport. There are nine round trips on Saturdays (three begin and three then later end at Martin State Airport) and 6 round trips on Sundays (two begin and two then later end at Martin State Airport).<ref name=\"penn line\" />\n*Increased mid-day service and [[reverse commute]] service on the Camden and Brunswick Lines.

In Spring 2009, to offset such budget shortfalls, ticket sales employees at most non-Amtrak stations were replaced with Amtrak \"[[Amtrak Arrow Reservation System|Quik-Trak]]\" [[touchscreen]] ticket machines, and some train services were eliminated or scaled back. Ticket machines were also added to stations that were not previously staffed, such as {{marc|Halethorpe}}.
