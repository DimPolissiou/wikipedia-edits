He was educated at the Stuarts' expense in the [[College of Juilly]], the [[Coll\u00e8ge du Plessis]], and the [[Jesuit College of La Fl\u00e8che]].<ref>{{harvnb|Holmes|2000|p=48}}.</ref> He went into the service of [[Charles V, Duke of Lorraine]], and was present at the siege of [[Buda]].

King James made him a [[Order of the Garter|Knight of the Order of the Garter]] and appointed him Colonel of The Blues to replace the Protestant [[Aubrey de Vere, 20th Earl of Oxford|Earl of Oxford]].<ref>{{harvnb|Holmes|2000|p=138}}.</ref> The post had been coveted by his maternal uncle the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Earl of Marlborough]], but FitzJames was earmarked for command, as Catholics replaced Anglicans.{{sfn|Thomson|1987|pp=49\u201350}} However, due to the invasion of The [[William III of England|Prince of Orange]] and the subsequent [[Glorious Revolution]], the installation never took place.<ref>{{harvnb|Holmes|2000|pp=148\u2013150}}.</ref> Berwick in all conscience could not remain with the Colonel of The Blues' Troop he had served since 1682; he refused to betray his old ''patronne''.{{sfn|White-Spunner|2010|p=121}} Officers were required to answer 'three questions' designed by the King to test their loyalty. Berwick was with his father at Salisbury, when key units deserted to the Prince of Orange. King James II was overthrown in December 1688 and Berwick went into exile with him.\n\nIn 1689 Berwick accompanied his father to Ireland and fought in the [[Williamite war in Ireland|Irish campaign]] at the [[Siege of Derry]], the [[Battle of Cavan]] and the [[Battle of the Boyne]] during which he led a charge, was unhorsed and almost killed in the melee.{{sfn|White-Spunner|2010|p=127}} When his father departed for France after the Boyne, Berwick remained with the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] [[Irish Army (Kingdom of Ireland)|Irish Army]] during the retreat to [[Limerick]].\n\nOn 2 August he was one of the Generals, with [[Patrick Sarsfield]] and [[Boisselau]] who shored up the defences at Limerick awaiting the Williamite assault; thereafter they rode north across the Shannon with a few Guards.{{sfn|White-Spunner|2010|pp=127\u2013130}} On 22 June 1691, Berwick was with the French general the [[Marquis de St Ruth]], at Aughrim, a site of his choosing when General Ginckel appeared over the hill with a superior force of 18,000 Williamites. The defenders were surrounded on one side by peat bog, and on the other Kilcommodon Hill.  Berwick was with Sarsfield's corps on the Irish right, who had an uncommitted reserve, when The Blues smashed through the Irish lines on the left, broke the Irish Dragoons, and caused a general panic to ensue. General St Ruth was decapitated by a stray cannonball, but Sarsfield was too late to rescue the situation.  He retired with Berwick to the relative safety of Limerick, which Ginckel besieged on 25 August. Under the terms of Treaty of Limerick, signed on 3 October, all Irish contingents were banished to the continent forever.  These soldiers became known as the [[Wild Geese (soldiers)|Wild Geese]]: mercenaries forbidden from setting foot in Britain.  James II created Berwick Colonel of the 1st Troop, Wild Geese.  Berwick arrived too late at the siege of Cork with 4,000 French troops, but unable to effect a result, he withdrew; Marlborough marched west to Kinsale to deal with 18,000 Frenchmen.{{sfn|Thomson|1987|pp=72\u201373}} It was at this time that he undertook a number of secret visits to England on behalf of the Jacobite cause.{{sfn|Holmes|2000|pp=186\u2013187}}\n\n== In the service of Louis XIV ==\nAfter his father's final exile, Berwick served in the French army under Marshal Luxemburg. He fought at the battles of [[Battle of Steenkerque|Steenkerque]]. Luxemburg fell into William's trap set against superior numbers, but reinforcements failed the English, and the French rallied to send the [[Maison Militaire du Roi]] infantry downhill. Berwick was in the charge of the division that broke the English lines. They were driven from the field with heavy losses.{{sfn|White-Spunner|2010|p=146}} Berwick was one of Luxemburg's principal officers, and in 1694 commanded the centre of a large French army.  After several forced marches to entrap William, they crossed the Meuse again before stopping them near [[Neerwinden]]. Berwick struggled against the Foot Guards, who forced his men to retreat in the [[Battle of Landen|Landen]]. He was taken prisoner by his cousin, Charles Churchill, and ransomed for 30,000 florins;{{sfn|Thomson|1987|p=82}} and later was exchanged for a wounded [[James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormonde|Duke of Ormonde]].{{sfn|White-Spunner|2010|pp=149\u2013150}} The Irish peer was accused of allowing himself to fall into enemy hands. The scandal swept Whitehall Palace causing angry questions in Parliament.\n\nAt the same time a huge number of 400 ships bound for the Smyrna Convoy were taken by the French. Because of his support for his father and service in the French army against England, he was attainted in 1695 by Act of Parliament rendering his British peerages forfeit.\n\n[[Image:Philip-V-Making-1st-Duke-of-Berwick.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Philip V of Spain creates James, Duke of Liria and J\u00e9rica after the [[Battle of Almanza]].]]\n\nAs a soldier, Berwick was highly esteemed for his courage, abilities and integrity. But when Marlborough challenged the French to fight at Liege, Boufflers retreated.{{sfn|Thomson|1987|p=102}} In June 1704, Berwick commanded a combined Franco-Spanish army but they did not seriously challenge the enemy, only taking a few of the [[Barrier Fortresses]].{{sfn|White-Spunner|2010|p=172}}  By July 1706 Berwick had established increasing dominance in the north of Spain as the Bourbons' premier general. In August partizans forced the Earl of Galway to evacuate Madrid allowing Berwick into winter quarters. As a result of distinguished service in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], he became a French subject and was appointed a [[Marshal of France]] after his successful expedition against [[Nice]] in 1706.\n\nLouis XIV was in the habit of sending his marshals lengthy orders. In 1707 he wrote the duc de Vendome: \"...it will be absolutely necessary for the Duke of Berwick to detach a similar proportion and to send a sufficient number of troops to the Elector of Bavaria...\"<ref>{{harvnb|Holmes|2000|p=370}}.</ref> The French allocated 75 battalions and 140 squadrons to the Rhine front, giving Berwick a comfortable numerical superiority.<ref>H{{harvnb|Holmes|2000|p=371}}.</ref> On 25 April 1707, Berwick won a great and decisive victory at the [[Battle of Almanza|Almanza]], where an Englishman at the head of a Franco-Spanish army defeated [[Henri de Massue, Marquis de Ruvigny, 1st Viscount Galway|Ruvigny]], a Frenchman at the head of an Anglo-Portuguese-Dutch army.<ref>{{harvnb|Holmes|2000|pp=28, 209, 356}}.</ref> Five English, six Dutch, and three Portuguese regiments were captured with all the cannon and regimental colours.  The defeat ended British hopes of putting the Austrian candidate on the Spanish throne.  Berwick was \"the brave English general who had defeated the French\" to confused Tories.{{sfn|Thomson|1987|p=196}} After Almanza, Berwick was created '''Duque de Liria y X\u00e9rica''' ([[English language|English]]: Duke of Liria and J\u00e9rica) and [[Lieutenant of Aragon]] by [[Philip V of Spain]] in 1707, and '''Duc de Fitz-James''' ([[English language|English]]: [[Duke of Fitz-James]]) in the [[Peerage of France]] by [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] in 1710.  But in the meantime in July 1707, Berwick heard the Allies had left Maastricht, sent 34 battalions and 75 squadrons north to meet Prince Eugene's army.  But Marlborough and the English army were none the wiser as to the enemy's whereabouts.  In the spring 1708, the Dutch raided Berwick's camp at Cenco killing all the men in their tents, Berwick was heard to remark that he could not believe the English \"could have been so barbarous\".<ref>Duke of Berwick's Letters, cited in {{harvnb|White-Spunner|2010|p=180}}.</ref>  By July Berwick had caught up with Vendome's army at [[Battle of Oudenarde|Oudenarde]], but was yet to arrive, anticipating Vendome would retreat to join up his force at Gavre six miles away.<ref>{{harvnb|Holmes|2000|p=379}}.</ref> But Berwick was at Givet on River Meuse when he heard of Vendome's heavy defeat.  Berwick rescued 9,000 stragglers using them to garrison Douai, and then Lille, where he prepared to be besieged.  Unfortunately the English arrived first, destroying the defensive ramparts, before he could reach the lines.  Nonetheless on 3 August, Berwick reckoned a siege was afoot reinforcing the garrison with 20 battalions and 7 squadrons of dragoons with horses. Lille was a heavily defended and fortified town, important to King Louis.

But Berwick warned the [[James Francis Edward Stuart|Old Pretender]] not to trust his uncle, since his spies at court knew Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, was a Whig.{{sfn|Thomson|1987|p=275}}\n\n== Foreign mercenary in exile ==\nThe last great event of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] was the Duke of Berwick's storming of [[Barcelona]], after [[Siege of Barcelona (1713\u20131714)|a long siege]], on 11 September 1714. In that year, he was appointed a [[Knight of the Golden Fleece]].

In December 1718 he led an army to Spain, against Philip V, in the [[War of the Quadruple Alliance]], bombarding [[San Sebasti\u00e1n]] and occupying the [[History of the Basques#A Basque trade area|districts of Gipuzkoa and Biscay]]. Many years of peace followed this campaign that ended the following March. The King of Spain sued for peace in January 1720 and Berwick was not called to serve again in the field until 1733. In that year he was chosen to lead the Army of the Rhine in the [[War of the Polish Succession]], successfully besieging [[Siege of Kehl (1733)|Kehl]] in 1733. A year later he was decapitated by a cannonball at the [[Siege of Philippsburg (1734)|Siege of Philippsburg]], on 12 June 1734.\n\n==Marriages and children==\n{{main article|House of FitzJames}}\n[[File:James, Duke of Berwick.png|thumb|200px|James FitzJames, Duke of Berwick]]\n\nBerwick had children by both his marriages.

Berwick was a successful general in the pay of [[Louis XIV of France]].\n\n== Early life ==\nFitzJames was born at [[Moulins, Allier|Moulins]] in France before his father's accession to the throne, and was brought up in France as a [[Roman Catholic]].  He was the son of James and his mistress [[Arabella Churchill (royal mistress)|Arabella Churchill]],{{sfn|Waller|2002|p=40}} sister of the English captain general and statesman  [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough]].  He was educated at the Stuarts' expense in the [[College of Juilly]], the [[Coll\u00e8ge du Plessis]], and the [[Jesuit College of La Fl\u00e8che]].<ref>{{harvnb|Holmes|2000|p=48}}.</ref> He went into the service of [[Charles V, Duke of Lorraine]], and was present at the siege of [[Buda]].

King James made him a [[Order of the Garter|Knight of the Order of the Garter]] and appointed him Colonel of The Blues to replace the Protestant [[Aubrey de Vere, 20th Earl of Oxford|Earl of Oxford]].<ref>{{harvnb|Holmes|2000|p=138}}.</ref> The post had been coveted by his maternal uncle the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Earl of Marlborough]], but FitzJames was earmarked for command, as Catholics replaced Anglicans.{{sfn|Thomson|1987|pp=49\u201350}} However, due to the invasion of The [[William III of England|Prince of Orange]] and the subsequent [[Glorious Revolution]], the installation never took place.<ref>{{harvnb|Holmes|2000|pp=148\u2013150}}.</ref> Berwick in all conscience could not remain with the Colonel of The Blues' Troop he had served since 1682; he refused to betray his old ''patronne''.{{sfn|White-Spunner|2010|p=121}} Officers were required to answer 'three questions' designed by the King to test their loyalty. Berwick was with his father at Salisbury, when key units deserted to the Prince of Orange. King James II was overthrown in December 1688 and Berwick went into exile with him.\n\nIn 1689 Berwick accompanied his father to Ireland and fought in the [[Williamite war in Ireland|Irish campaign]] at the [[Siege of Derry]], the [[Battle of Cavan]] and the [[Battle of the Boyne]] during which he led a charge, was unhorsed and almost killed in the melee.{{sfn|White-Spunner|2010|p=127}} When his father departed for France after the Boyne, Berwick remained with the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] [[Irish Army (Kingdom of Ireland)|Irish Army]] during the retreat to [[Limerick]].\n\nOn 2 August he was one of the Generals, with [[Patrick Sarsfield]] and [[Boisselau]] who shored up the defences at Limerick awaiting the Williamite assault; thereafter they rode north across the Shannon with a few Guards.{{sfn|White-Spunner|2010|pp=127\u2013130}} On 22 June 1691, Berwick was with the French general the [[Marquis de St Ruth]], at Aughrim, a site of his choosing when General Ginckel appeared over the hill with a superior force of 18,000 Williamites. The defenders were surrounded on one side by peat bog, and on the other Kilcommodon Hill.  Berwick was with Sarsfield's corps on the Irish right, who had an uncommitted reserve, when The Blues smashed through the Irish lines on the left, broke the Irish Dragoons, and caused a general panic to ensue. General St Ruth was decapitated by a stray cannonball, but Sarsfield was too late to rescue the situation.  He retired with Berwick to the relative safety of Limerick, which Ginckel besieged on 25 August. Under the terms of Treaty of Limerick, signed on 3 October, all Irish contingents were banished to the continent forever.  These soldiers became known as the [[Wild Geese (soldiers)|Wild Geese]]: mercenaries forbidden from setting foot in Britain.  James II created Berwick Colonel of the 1st Troop, Wild Geese.  Berwick arrived too late at the siege of Cork with 4,000 French troops, but unable to effect a result, he withdrew; Marlborough marched west to Kinsale to deal with 18,000 Frenchmen.{{sfn|Thomson|1987|pp=72\u201373}} It was at this time that he undertook a number of secret visits to England on behalf of the Jacobite cause.{{sfn|Holmes|2000|pp=186\u2013187}}\n\n== In the service of Louis XIV ==\nAfter his father's final exile, Berwick served in the French army under Marshal Luxemburg. He fought at the battles of [[Battle of Steenkerque|Steenkerque]]. Luxemburg fell into William's trap set against superior numbers. But reinforcements failed the English, and the French rallied to send the [[Maison Militaire du Roi]] infantry downhill. Berwick was in the charge of the division that broke the English lines. They were driven from the field with heavy losses.{{sfn|White-Spunner|2010|p=146}} Berwick was one of Luxemburg's principal officers, and in 1694 commanded the centre of a large French army.  After several forced marches to entrap William, they crossed the Meuse again before stopping them near [[Neerwinden]]. Berwick struggled against the Foot Guards, who forced his men to retreat in the [[Battle of Landen|Landen]]. He was taken prisoner by his cousin, Charles Churchill, and ransomed for 30,000 florins;{{sfn|Thomson|1987|p=82}} and later was exchanged for a wounded [[James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormonde|Duke of Ormonde]].{{sfn|White-Spunner|2010|pp=149\u2013150}} The Irish peer was accused of allowing himself to fall into enemy hands. The scandal swept Whitehall Palace causing angry questions in Parliament.\n\nAt the same time a huge number of 400 ships bound for the Smyrna Convoy were taken by the French. Because of his support for his father and service in the French army against England, he was attainted in 1695 by Act of Parliament rendering his British peerages forfeit.\n\n[[Image:Philip-V-Making-1st-Duke-of-Berwick.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Philip V of Spain creates James, Duke of Liria and J\u00e9rica after the [[Battle of Almanza]].]]\n\nAs a soldier, Berwick was highly esteemed for his courage, abilities and integrity. But when Marlborough challenged the French to fight at Liege, Boufflers retreated.{{sfn|Thomson|1987|p=102}} In June 1704, Berwick commanded a combined Franco-Spanish army but they did not seriously challenge the enemy, only taking a few of the [[Barrier Fortresses]].{{sfn|White-Spunner|2010|p=172}}  By July 1706 Berwick had established increasing dominance in the north of Spain as the Bourbons' premier general. In August partizans forced the Earl of Galway to evacuate Madrid allowing Berwick into winter quarters. As a result of distinguished service in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], he became a French subject and was appointed a [[Marshal of France]] after his successful expedition against [[Nice]] in 1706.\n\nLouis XIV was in the habit of sending his marshals lengthy orders. In 1707 he wrote the duc de Vendome: \"...it will be absolutely necessary for the Duke of Berwick to detach a similar proportion and to send a sufficient number of troops to the Elector of Bavaria...\"<ref>{{harvnb|Holmes|2000|p=370}}.</ref> The French allocated 75 battalions and 140 squadrons to the Rhine front, giving Berwick a comfortable numerical superiority.<ref>H{{harvnb|Holmes|2000|p=371}}.</ref> On 25 April 1707, Berwick won a great and decisive victory at the [[Battle of Almanza|Almanza]], where an Englishman at the head of a Franco-Spanish army defeated [[Henri de Massue, Marquis de Ruvigny, 1st Viscount Galway|Ruvigny]], a Frenchman at the head of an Anglo-Portuguese-Dutch army.<ref>{{harvnb|Holmes|2000|pp=28, 209, 356}}.</ref> Five English, six Dutch, and three Portuguese regiments were captured with all the cannon and regimental colours.  The defeat ended British hopes of putting the Austrian candidate on the Spanish throne.  Berwick was \"the brave English general who had defeated the French\" to confused Tories.{{sfn|Thomson|1987|p=196}} After Almanza, Berwick was created '''Duque de Liria y X\u00e9rica''' ([[English language|English]]: Duke of Liria and J\u00e9rica) and [[Lieutenant of Aragon]] by [[Philip V of Spain]] in 1707, and '''Duc de Fitz-James''' ([[English language|English]]: [[Duke of Fitz-James]]) in the [[Peerage of France]] by [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] in 1710.  But in the meantime in July 1707, Berwick heard the Allies had left Maastricht, sent 34 battalions and 75 squadrons north to meet Prince Eugene's army.  But Marlborough and the English army were none the wiser as to the enemy's whereabouts.  In the spring 1708, the Dutch raided Berwick's camp at Cenco killing all the men in their tents, Berwick was heard to remark that he could not believe the English \"could have been so barbarous\".<ref>Duke of Berwick's Letters, cited in {{harvnb|White-Spunner|2010|p=180}}.</ref>  By July Berwick had caught up with Vendome's army at [[Battle of Oudenarde|Oudenarde]], but was yet to arrive, anticipating Vendome would retreat to join up his force at Gavre six miles away.<ref>{{harvnb|Holmes|2000|p=379}}.</ref> But Berwick was at Givet on River Meuse when he heard of Vendome's heavy defeat.  Berwick rescued 9,000 stragglers using them to garrison Douai, and then Lille, where he prepared to be besieged.  Unfortunately the English arrived first, destroying the defensive ramparts, before he could reach the lines.  Nonetheless on 3 August, Berwick reckoned a siege was afoot reinforcing the garrison with 20 battalions and 7 squadrons of dragoons with horses. Lille was a heavily defended and fortified town, important to King Louis. Astutely, Berwick realized Marlborough was trying to bring his battered army to battle, despite constant missives from Versailles ordering an immediate attack.<ref>Holmes, p.396</ref> On 22 October Marshal Boufflers finally gave up and marched out to Douai.  But crucially, Berwick's army remained intact.{{sfn|Thomson|1987|p=217}}\n\nBerwick was Marlborough's nephew. Long before he had become a [[Marshall of France]], he had remained in contact with his uncle's family when they were in exile, when the siege at Lille began.{{sfn|Thomson|1987|p=220}} Berwick sent an equerry to purchase some horses off the Allies.<ref>Duke of Berwick to Marlborough 8 September 1703 in British Library, Add MS 61270, f.1, {{harv|Holmes|2000|p=468}}.</ref> Furthermore, his widowed mother married Colonel Godfrey of the English army.  In 1710, the Tories won the election, sweeping away Protestant opposition to a peace with France.

But Berwick warned the [[James Francis Edward Stuart|Old Pretender]] not to trust his uncle, since his spies at court knew Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, was a Whig.{{sfn|Thomson|1987|p=275}}\n\n== Foreign mercenary in exile ==\nThe last great event of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] was the Duke of Berwick's storming of [[Barcelona]], after [[Siege of Barcelona (1713\u20131714)|a long siege]], on 11 September 1714. In that year, he was appointed a [[Knight of the Golden Fleece]]. Trying to explain the violent failure of the [[Jacobite rising of 1715|Jacobite Risings]], the Old Pretender \"never forgave his half-brother, The Blues ex-colonel, Berwick, now an experienced and competent commander, for declining to lead his forces\".{{sfn|White-Spunner|2010|p=167}} Soon afterwards, Berwick was appointed military governor of the province of [[Guienne]], where he became friendly with [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]]. In December 1718 he led an army to Spain, against Philip V, in the [[War of the Quadruple Alliance]], bombarding [[San Sebasti\u00e1n]] and occupying the [[History of the Basques#A Basque trade area|districts of Gipuzkoa and Biscay]]. Many years of peace followed this campaign that ended the following March. The King of Spain sued for peace in January 1720 and Berwick was not called to serve again in the field until 1733. In that year he was chosen to lead the Army of the Rhine in the [[War of the Polish Succession]], successfully besieging [[Siege of Kehl (1733)|Kehl]] in 1733. A year later he was decapitated by a cannonball at the [[Siege of Philippsburg (1734)|Siege of Philippsburg]], on 12 June 1734.\n\n==Marriages and children==\n{{main article|House of FitzJames}}\n[[File:James, Duke of Berwick.png|thumb|200px|James FitzJames, Duke of Berwick]]\n\nBerwick had children by both his marriages.

[[Television station]]s also began to introduce [[V-Chip]] technology to limit access to television content.

They are also able to turn devices off during specific times of the day, limiting the volume output of devices, and with [[GPS]] technology becoming affordable, it is now possible to easily locate devices such as mobile phones.\n\nThe demand for parental control methods that restrict content has increased over the decades due to the rising availability of the Internet.

Psychological control involves parents trying to influence children's behavior.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://go.galegroup.com.ezproxy.pvc.maricopa.edu/ps/retrieve.do?tabID=T003&resultListType=RESULT_LIST&searchResultsType=SingleTab&searchType=BasicSearchForm&currentPosition=1&docId=GALE%7CCX2940400241&docType=Topic+overview&sort=RELEVANCE&contentSegment=&prodId=GVRL&contentSet=GALE%7CCX2940400241&searchId=R1&userGroupName=mcc_pv&inPS=true#|title=Parenting|last=Laible|first=D|date=2012|website=Gale Virtual Reference Library}}</ref>\n\nSeveral techniques exist for creating parental controls for blocking websites. Add-on parental control software may monitor [[API]] in order to observe applications such as a web browser or Internet chat application and to intervene according to certain criteria, such as a match in a database of banned words. Virtually all parental control software includes a password or other form of [[authentication]] to prevent unauthorized users from disabling it\n\nTechniques involving a [[proxy server]] are also used.<ref>{{cite web|last=Seltzer|first=Larry|title=Turn Your Windows Home Server Into A Proxy Server|url=http://securitywatch.pcmag.com/networking/284935-turn-your-windows-home-server-into-a-proxy-server|accessdate=26 September 2008}}</ref> A [[web browser]] is set to send requests for web content to the proxy server rather than directly to the web server intended. The proxy server then fetches the web page from the server on the browser's behalf and passes on the content to the browser. Proxy servers can inspect the data being sent and received and intervene depending on various criteria relating to content of the page or the URL being requested, for example, using a [[database]] of banned words or banned URLs. The proxy method's major disadvantage is that it requires that the client application to be configured to utilize the proxy, and if it is possible for the user to reconfigure applications to access the Internet directly rather than going through the proxy, then this control is easily bypassed. Proxy servers themselves may be used to circumvent parental controls. There are other techniques used to bypass parental controls.\n\nThe computer usage management method, unlike content filters, is focused on empowering the parents to balance the computing environment for children by regulating gaming. The main idea of these applications is to allow parents to introduce a learning component into the computing time of children, who must earn gaming time while working through educational contents.\n\nLately{{when|date=June 2018}} network-based parental control devices have emerged. These devices working as a firewall router use packet filtering, DNS [[Response policy zone|Response Policy Zone]] (RPZ) and [[Deep packet inspection]] (DPI) methods to block inappropriate web content. These methods have been used in commercial and governmental communication networks. Another form of these devices made for home networks has been developed. These devices plug into the home router and create a new wireless network, which is specifically designed for kids to connect to.<ref>\"US interest in router box offering parental control.\" ''Australian'' [National, Australia], 24 Jan. 2017, p. 24.

Some examples of mobile devices that contain parental controls include cell phones, tablets, and e-readers. In November 2007, Verizon was the first carrier to offer age-appropriate content filters as well as the first to offer generic content filters, recognizing that mobile devices were used to access all manner of content from movies and music to short-code programs and websites. In June 2009, in iPhone OS 3.0, Apple was the first company to provide a built-in mechanism on mobile devices to create age brackets for users that would block unwanted applications from being downloaded to the device. In the following years, the developers of all major operating systems have presented in-built tools for parental control, including Linux,<ref>{{cite web|title=Parental Content Control |url=https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ParentalControls |date=17 September 2017}}</ref> Android, Windows, and even the more business-oriented platform Blackberry.<ref>{{cite web|title=Parental Control on Smartphones: How to Choose the Right Application? |url=http://www.spyrix.com/parental-control-on-smartphones-how-to-choose-the-right-application.php |date=15 August 2016}}</ref> There are also applications that allow parents to monitor real-time conversations on their children's phone via access to text messages, browser history, and application history. An example of one of these is TrendMicro<ref>\"Trend Micro Announces the Next Generation Mobile Security Solution for the Android Platform.\" ''Benzinga.com'' 15 Sept. 2011. ''Business Insights: Global''. Web. 27 Oct. 2018.</ref>which not only offers protection from viruses, but also offers parental controls to phones and tablets of almost all brands. Most of these offer the ability to add extra features to parental controls. These apps have the features mobile devices already have, but have additional features such as, being able to monitor and filter texts/calls, protection while surfing the web, and denied access to specific websites. Applications of this sort have created a rising competition in their market.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shamout|first=Omar|date=6 October 2014|title=Parental controls|url=http://www.labusinessjournal.com/|journal=Los Angeles Business Journal|volume=36|issue=40|pages=12}}</ref> \n\nMobile device software enables parents to restrict which applications their child can access while also allowing parents to monitor text messages, phone logs, MMS pictures, and other transactions occurring on their child's mobile device; to enable parents to set time limit on the usage of mobile devices; and to track the exact location of their children as well as monitor calls and the content of texts. This software also allows parents to monitor social media accounts. Parents are able to view posts, pictures, and any interactions in real time. Another function of this software is to keep track of [[bullying]].<ref>{{Cite book|chapter=Searcy, Philip Roy, (15 April 1914\u20135 Oct. 1983), Australian Consul-General, Los Angeles, 1971\u201375|date=2007-12-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|series=Who Was Who|doi = 10.1093/ww/9780199540884.013.u168949|title = Who Was Who}}</ref> \n<!-- (Commenting this out because it doesn't make sense as written.

However, if the computer's [[BIOS]] is configured to disallow booting from removable media, and if changes to the BIOS are prohibited without proper authentication, then booting into an alternative operating system is not available without circumventing BIOS security by partially disassembling the computer and resetting BIOS configuration using a button or jumper, or removing and replacing the internal button cell battery.<ref>{{cite web|title=How to Bypass the Parental Control Time Limits in Windows 7/Vista/XP|url=http://www.zimbio.com/Password+Recovery+Software/articles/Xv5Q3c1x3wZ/How+Bypass+Parental+Control+Time+Limits+Windows|accessdate=6 September 2012}}</ref>\n* Using external proxy servers or other servers. The user sends requests to the external server which retrieves content on the user's behalf. Filtering software may then never be able to know which URLs the user is accessing, as all communications are with the one external server and filtering software never sees any communications with the web servers from which content really originated. To counter this, filtering software may also block access to popular proxies. Additionally, filtering systems which only permit access to a set of allowed URLs (whitelisting) will not permit access anything outside this list, including proxy servers.\n* Resetting passwords using exploits\n* Modifying the software's files{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n* [[Brute-force attack]]s on software passwords<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://hackaday.com/2013/07/06/brute-force-attack-xbox-360-parental-controls/|title = Brute force attack Xbox 360 parental controls|date = 6 July 2014|accessdate = 9 August 2014|website = Hack A Day|publisher = Hackaday|last = Szczys|first = Mike}}</ref>\n\n<!-- NOTE: Following is factual information, and does not endorse any single product.

However, in most browsers a user may select 'Incognito' or 'InPrivate' browsing, enter search terms for content, and select the 'image' tab to effectively bypass 'safe search' and many parental control filters. See below for router based considerations and solutions.\n\nFiltering that occurs outside of the individuals computer (such as at the router) cannot be bypassed using the above methods (except for 'Incognito/InPrivate' modes). However,\n\n* The major search engines cache and serve content on their own servers. As a result, domain filters such as many third party DNS servers, also fail to filter the 'Incognito/InPrivate' with 'image' tab.\n* Most commercially available routers with parental controls do not enforce safe search at the router, and therefore do not filter the 'Incognito/InPrivate' with 'image' tab.\n* Safe search may be enforced at a DNS server or router.<ref>For Google, for example, see https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/186669?hl=en.

Psychological control involves parents trying to influence children's behavior.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://go.galegroup.com.ezproxy.pvc.maricopa.edu/ps/retrieve.do?tabID=T003&resultListType=RESULT_LIST&searchResultsType=SingleTab&searchType=BasicSearchForm&currentPosition=1&docId=GALE%7CCX2940400241&docType=Topic+overview&sort=RELEVANCE&contentSegment=&prodId=GVRL&contentSet=GALE%7CCX2940400241&searchId=R1&userGroupName=mcc_pv&inPS=true#|title=Parenting|last=Laible|first=D|date=2012|website=Gale Virtual Reference Library}}</ref>\n\nSeveral techniques exist for creating parental controls for blocking websites. Add-on parental control software may monitor [[API]] in order to observe applications such as a web browser or Internet chat application and to intervene according to certain criteria, such as a match in a database of banned words. Virtually all parental control software includes a password or other form of [[authentication]] to prevent unauthorized users from disabling it\n\nTechniques involving a [[proxy server]] are also used.<ref>{{cite web|last=Seltzer|first=Larry|title=Turn Your Windows Home Server Into A Proxy Server|url=http://securitywatch.pcmag.com/networking/284935-turn-your-windows-home-server-into-a-proxy-server|accessdate=26 September 2008}}</ref> A [[web browser]] is set to send requests for web content to the proxy server rather than directly to the web server intended. The proxy server then fetches the web page from the server on the browser's behalf and passes on the content to the browser. Proxy servers can inspect the data being sent and received and intervene depending on various criteria relating to content of the page or the URL being requested, for example, using a [[database]] of banned words or banned URLs. The proxy method's major disadvantage is that it requires that the client application to be configured to utilize the proxy, and if it is possible for the user to reconfigure applications to access the Internet directly rather than going through the proxy, then this control is easily bypassed. Proxy servers themselves may be used to circumvent parental controls. There are other techniques used to bypass parental controls.\n\nThe computer usage management method, unlike content filters, is focused on empowering the parents to balance the computing environment for children by regulating gaming. The main idea of these applications is to allow parents to introduce a learning component into the computing time of children, who must earn gaming time while working through educational contents.\n\nLately{{when|date=June 2018}} network-based parental control devices have emerged. These devices working as a firewall router use packet filtering, DNS [[Response policy zone|Response Policy Zone]] (RPZ) and [[Deep packet inspection]] (DPI) methods to block inappropriate web content. These methods have been used in commercial and governmental communication networks. Another form of these devices made for home networks has been developed. These devices plug into the home router and create a new wireless network, which is specifically designed for kids to connect to.<ref>\"US interest in router box offering parental control.\" ''Australian'' [National, Australia], 24 Jan. 2017, p. 24.

Some examples of mobile devices that contain parental controls include cell phones, tablets, and e-readers. In November 2007, Verizon was the first carrier to offer age-appropriate content filters as well as the first to offer generic content filters, recognizing that mobile devices were used to access all manner of content from movies and music to short-code programs and websites. In June 2009, in iPhone OS 3.0, Apple was the first company to provide a built-in mechanism on mobile devices to create age brackets for users that would block unwanted applications from being downloaded to the device. In the following years, the developers of all major operating systems have presented in-built tools for parental control, including Linux,<ref>{{cite web|title=Parental Content Control |url=https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ParentalControls |date=17 September 2017}}</ref> Android, Windows, and even the more business-oriented platform Blackberry.<ref>{{cite web|title=Parental Control on Smartphones: How to Choose the Right Application? |url=http://www.spyrix.com/parental-control-on-smartphones-how-to-choose-the-right-application.php |date=15 August 2016}}</ref> There are also applications that allow parents to monitor real-time conversations on their children's phone via access to text messages, browser history, and application history. An example of one of these is TrendMicro<ref>\"Trend Micro Announces the Next Generation Mobile Security Solution for the Android Platform.\" ''Benzinga.com'' 15 Sept. 2011. ''Business Insights: Global''. Web. 27 Oct. 2018.</ref>which not only offers protection from viruses, but also offers parental controls to phones and tablets of almost all brands. Most of these offer the ability to add extra features to parental controls. These apps have the features mobile devices already have, but have additional features such as, being able to monitor and filter texts/calls, protection while surfing the web, and denied access to specific websites. Applications of this sort have created a rising competition in their market.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shamout|first=Omar|date=6 October 2014|title=Parental controls|url=http://www.labusinessjournal.com/|journal=Los Angeles Business Journal|volume=36|issue=40|pages=12}}</ref> \n\nMobile device software enables parents to restrict which applications their child can access while also allowing parents to monitor text messages, phone logs, MMS pictures, and other transactions occurring on their child's mobile device; to enable parents to set time limit on the usage of mobile devices; and to track the exact location of their children as well as monitor calls and the content of texts. This software also allows parents to monitor social media accounts. Parents are able to view posts, pictures, and any interactions in real time. Another function of this software is to keep track of [[bullying]].<ref>{{Cite book|chapter=Searcy, Philip Roy, (15 April 1914\u20135 Oct. 1983), Australian Consul-General, Los Angeles, 1971\u201375|date=2007-12-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|series=Who Was Who|doi = 10.1093/ww/9780199540884.013.u168949|title = Who Was Who}}</ref> \n<!-- (Commenting this out because it doesn't make sense as written.

However, if the computer's [[BIOS]] is configured to disallow booting from removable media, and if changes to the BIOS are prohibited without proper authentication, then booting into an alternative operating system is not available without circumventing BIOS security by partially disassembling the computer and resetting BIOS configuration using a button or jumper, or removing and replacing the internal button cell battery.<ref>{{cite web|title=How to Bypass the Parental Control Time Limits in Windows 7/Vista/XP|url=http://www.zimbio.com/Password+Recovery+Software/articles/Xv5Q3c1x3wZ/How+Bypass+Parental+Control+Time+Limits+Windows|accessdate=6 September 2012}}</ref>\n* Using external proxy servers or other servers. The user sends requests to the external server which retrieves content on the user's behalf. Filtering software may then never be able to know which URLs the user is accessing, as all communications are with the one external server and filtering software never sees any communications with the web servers from which content really originated. To counter this, filtering software may also block access to popular proxies. Additionally, filtering systems which only permit access to a set of allowed URLs (whitelisting) will not permit access anything outside this list, including proxy servers.\n* Resetting passwords using exploits\n* Modifying the software's files{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n* [[Brute-force attack]]s on software passwords<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://hackaday.com/2013/07/06/brute-force-attack-xbox-360-parental-controls/|title = Brute force attack Xbox 360 parental controls|date = 6 July 2014|accessdate = 9 August 2014|website = Hack A Day|publisher = Hackaday|last = Szczys|first = Mike}}</ref>\n\n<!-- NOTE: Following is factual information, and does not endorse any single product.

However, in most browsers a user may select 'Incognito' or 'InPrivate' browsing, enter search terms for content, and select the 'image' tab to effectively bypass 'safe search' and many parental control filters. See below for router based considerations and solutions.\n\nFiltering that occurs outside of the individuals computer (such as at the router) cannot be bypassed using the above methods (except for 'Incognito/InPrivate' modes). However,\n\n* The major search engines cache and serve content on their own servers. As a result, domain filters such as many third party DNS servers, also fail to filter the 'Incognito/InPrivate' with 'image' tab.\n* Most commercially available routers with parental controls do not enforce safe search at the router, and therefore do not filter the 'Incognito/InPrivate' with 'image' tab.\n* Safe search may be enforced at a DNS server or router.<ref>For Google, for example, see https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/186669?hl=en.

Restrictions on video games can help children and adolescents form a positive and healthy relationship with games, which would result in video games being used with great results. For example, according to Tobias Greitemeyer, \u201cplaying prosocial video games increases helping behavior and decreases aggressive outcomes. Likewise, playing cooperative team-player (relative to a single-player) video games increases cooperative behavior\u201d.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rothmund|first=Tobias|last2=Bender|first2=Jens|last3=Nauroth|first3=Peter|last4=Gollwitzer|first4=Mario|date=2015|title=Public concerns about violent video games are moral concerns\u2014How moral threat can make pacifists susceptible to scientific and political claims against violent video games|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|language=en|volume=45|issue=6|pages=769\u2013783|doi=10.1002/ejsp.2125|issn=1099-0992}}</ref> With the right video games children could develop positive skills such as problem solving, critical thinking, collaboration, communication, planning, and strategy.

They are named for their prominent placement along the checkout lines of [[supermarkets]].\n\nIn the 1960s, the ''National Enquirer'' began selling magazines in supermarkets as an alternative to newsstands.  To sweeten the deal with supermarkets, they offered to buy back unsold issues.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThese tabloids\u2014such as ''[[The Globe (tabloid)|The Globe]]'' and the ''National Enquirer''\u2014often use aggressive and usually mean-spirited tactics to sell their issues. Unlike regular tabloid-format newspapers, supermarket tabloids are distributed through the magazine distribution channel, similarly to other weekly magazines and mass-market paperback books. Leading examples include the ''National Enquirer'', ''[[Star (magazine)|Star]]'', ''[[Weekly World News]]'' (itself a parody of the style), and the ''[[Sun (supermarket tabloid)|Sun]]''. Most major supermarket tabloids in the U.S. are published by [[American Media (publisher)|American Media, Inc.]], including the ''National Enquirer'', ''Star'', ''[[The Globe (tabloid)|The Globe]]'', and ''[[National Examiner]]''.\n\nA major event in the history of U.S. supermarket tabloids was the successful libel lawsuit by [[Carol Burnett]] against the ''National Enquirer'' (''[[Carol Burnett v. National Enquirer, Inc.]]''), arising out of a false 1976 report in the ''National Enquirer'', implying she was drunk and boisterous in a public encounter with U.S. Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]]. Though its impact is widely debated, it is generally seen as a significant turning point in the relations between celebrities and tabloid journalism, increasing the willingness of celebrities to sue for libel in the U.S., and somewhat dampening the recklessness of U.S. tabloids.<ref name= \"carol_burnett_launches_1981_03_22_upi\">{{cite news | last= Scott | first= Vernon | url= http://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/03/22/Carol-Burnett-launches-trial-balloon/6032354085200/ | title= Carol Burnett launches trial balloon | date= March 22, 1981 | publisher= [[United Press International]] | website= UPI.com | accessdate= January 1, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"carol_burnett_given_1981_03_27_lindsey_nytimes\">{{cite news | last= Lindsey | first= Robert | url= https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/27/us/carol-burnett-given-1.6-million-in-suit-against-national-enquirer.html | title= Carol Burnett given 1.6 million in suit against National Enquirer | date= March 27, 1981 | work= [[The New York Times]] | accessdate= January 1, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"how_tabloids_1991_01_04_nytimes\">[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/04/news/how-the-supermarket-tabloids-stay-out-of-court.html \"How the Supermarket Tabloids Stay Out of Court\"], January 4, 1991, ''The New York Times'', retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name= \"tabloids_lies_1991_08_12_langberg_nytimes\">{{cite news | last= Langberg | first= Barry | url= http://articles.latimes.com/1991-08-12/entertainment/ca-468_1_tabloids | title= Tabloids' Lies Abuse the First Amendment | date= August 12, 1991 | work= [[Los Angeles Times]] | accessdate= January 1, 2017}} (Opinion essay by libel attorney for Carol Burnett and others)</ref><ref name= \"tabloid_law_1999_08_atlantic\">{{cite news | last= Beam | first= Alex | url= https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/08/tabloid-law/377722/ | title= Tabloid Law| date= August 1999 | work= [[The Atlantic Monthly]] | accessdate= January 1, 2017}}</ref><ref name= \"dr_phil_2016_07_14_wash_post\">{{cite news | last= Andrews | first= Travis M. | url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/07/14/dr-phil-and-wife-robin-sue-the-national-enquirer-for-250000-million-citing-defamation/ | title= Dr. Phil and wife Robin sue the National Enquirer for $250 million, citing defamation | date= July 14, 2016 | work= [[The Washington Post]] | accessdate= January 1, 2017}}</ref> Other celebrities have attempted to sue tabloid magazines for libel and slander including [[Richard Simmons]] in 2017<ref>{{cite web |title= ''Richard Simmons v the National Enquirer'' |url= https://www.scribd.com/document/357656566/Richard-Simmons-v-the-National-Enquirer | via=Scribd |access-date= November 1, 2017}}</ref> and [[Phil McGraw]] in 2016.<ref name= \"dr_phil_2016_07_14_wash_post\" />\n\nTabloids may [[chequebook journalism|pay for stories]].

Notable tabloid publications include the ''[[National Enquirer]]'' and ''[[Globe (tabloid)|Globe]]'' in North America; and the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', ''[[Daily Express]]'', ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', ''[[Daily Star (British newspaper)|Daily Star]]'', ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'', ''[[Sunday Mail (Scotland)|Sunday Mail]]'', ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', and the former ''[[News of the World]]'' in the UK.\n\n==Supermarket tabloids==\n{{see also|Gossip magazine}}\n\nIn the United States and Canada, \"supermarket tabloids\" are large, national versions of these tabloids, usually published weekly. They are named for their prominent placement along the checkout lines of [[supermarkets]].\n\nIn the 1960s, the ''National Enquirer'' began selling magazines in supermarkets as an alternative to newsstands.  To sweeten the deal with supermarkets, they offered to buy back unsold issues.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThese tabloids\u2014such as ''[[The Globe (tabloid)|The Globe]]'' and the ''National Enquirer''\u2014often use aggressive and usually mean-spirited tactics to sell their issues. Unlike regular tabloid-format newspapers, supermarket tabloids are distributed through the magazine distribution channel, similarly to other weekly magazines and mass-market paperback books. Leading examples include the ''National Enquirer'', ''[[Star (magazine)|Star]]'', ''[[Weekly World News]]'' (itself a parody of the style), and the ''[[Sun (supermarket tabloid)|Sun]]''. Most major supermarket tabloids in the U.S. are published by [[American Media (publisher)|American Media, Inc.]], including the ''National Enquirer'', ''Star'', ''[[The Globe (tabloid)|The Globe]]'', and ''[[National Examiner]]''.\n\nA major event in the history of U.S. supermarket tabloids was the successful libel lawsuit by [[Carol Burnett]] against the ''National Enquirer'' (''[[Carol Burnett v. National Enquirer, Inc.]]''), arising out of a false 1976 report in the ''National Enquirer'', implying she was drunk and boisterous in a public encounter with U.S. Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]]. Though its impact is widely debated, it is generally seen as a significant turning point in the relations between celebrities and tabloid journalism, increasing the willingness of celebrities to sue for libel in the U.S., and somewhat dampening the recklessness of U.S. tabloids.<ref name= \"carol_burnett_launches_1981_03_22_upi\">{{cite news | last= Scott | first= Vernon | url= http://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/03/22/Carol-Burnett-launches-trial-balloon/6032354085200/ | title= Carol Burnett launches trial balloon | date= March 22, 1981 | publisher= [[United Press International]] | website= UPI.com | accessdate= January 1, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"carol_burnett_given_1981_03_27_lindsey_nytimes\">{{cite news | last= Lindsey | first= Robert | url= https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/27/us/carol-burnett-given-1.6-million-in-suit-against-national-enquirer.html | title= Carol Burnett given 1.6 million in suit against National Enquirer | date= March 27, 1981 | work= [[The New York Times]] | accessdate= January 1, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"how_tabloids_1991_01_04_nytimes\">[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/04/news/how-the-supermarket-tabloids-stay-out-of-court.html \"How the Supermarket Tabloids Stay Out of Court\"], January 4, 1991, ''The New York Times'', retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name= \"tabloids_lies_1991_08_12_langberg_nytimes\">{{cite news | last= Langberg | first= Barry | url= http://articles.latimes.com/1991-08-12/entertainment/ca-468_1_tabloids | title= Tabloids' Lies Abuse the First Amendment | date= August 12, 1991 | work= [[Los Angeles Times]] | accessdate= January 1, 2017}} (Opinion essay by libel attorney for Carol Burnett and others)</ref><ref name= \"tabloid_law_1999_08_atlantic\">{{cite news | last= Beam | first= Alex | url= https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/08/tabloid-law/377722/ | title= Tabloid Law| date= August 1999 | work= [[The Atlantic Monthly]] | accessdate= January 1, 2017}}</ref><ref name= \"dr_phil_2016_07_14_wash_post\">{{cite news | last= Andrews | first= Travis M. | url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/07/14/dr-phil-and-wife-robin-sue-the-national-enquirer-for-250000-million-citing-defamation/ | title= Dr. Phil and wife Robin sue the National Enquirer for $250 million, citing defamation | date= July 14, 2016 | work= [[The Washington Post]] | accessdate= January 1, 2017}}</ref> Other celebrities have attempted to sue tabloid magazines for libel and slander including [[Richard Simmons]] in 2017<ref>{{cite web |title= ''Richard Simmons v the National Enquirer'' |url= https://www.scribd.com/document/357656566/Richard-Simmons-v-the-National-Enquirer | via=Scribd |access-date= November 1, 2017}}</ref> and [[Phil McGraw]] in 2016.<ref name= \"dr_phil_2016_07_14_wash_post\" />\n\nTabloids may [[chequebook journalism|pay for stories]].
