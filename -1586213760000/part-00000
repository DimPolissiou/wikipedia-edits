He then became one of the most successful [[Stallion|sires]] of the 20th century. He is considered a Canadian icon, and was inducted into the [[Canadian Sports Hall of Fame]] in 1965. Induction into the Racing Hall of Fame in both Canada and the United States followed in 1976. As a competitor, ''[[The Blood-Horse]]'' ranked him as one of the [[Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century|top 100 U.S. Thoroughbred racehorses of the 20th century]]. As a sire of sires, his impact on the breed is still felt worldwide.\n\nAt age two, Northern Dancer was named the [[Canadian Champion Two-Year-Old Colt]] after winning both the [[Summer Stakes (Canada)|Summer Stakes]] and [[Coronation Futurity]] in Canada, plus the [[Remsen Stakes]] in New York. At three, he became a leading contender for the Kentucky Derby with wins in the [[Flamingo Stakes]], [[Florida Derby]], and [[Blue Grass Stakes]]. Northern Dancer followed up a narrow victory in the Kentucky Derby by winning the [[Preakness Stakes]]. With a chance at the [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)|American Triple Crown]], he finished third in the [[Belmont Stakes]]. Returning to Canada for a hero's welcome, he then won the [[Queen's Plate]] in what proved to be his last race.\n\nNorthern Dancer retired to stud in 1965 at [[Windfields Farm]] in Canada. He was an immediate success when his first crop reached racing age in 1968, and the success of his second crop, led by [[English Triple Crown]] winner [[Nijinsky (horse)|Nijinsky]], brought his name to the international stage. Northern Dancer was relocated to the Maryland branch of Windfields Farm, where he became the most sought sire of his time.\n\n==Background==\nNorthern Dancer was a [[Bay (horse)|bay]] [[stallion]] with a crooked white [[Horse markings#Facial markings|blaze]] and three white [[Horse markings#Leg markings|socks]].<ref name=\"KingOfCanada\">{{cite web |title=The King of Canada: Northern Dancer |url=https://horsenetwork.com/2017/06/king-canada-northern-dancer/ |website=Horse Network |accessdate=13 January 2020 |date=28 June 2017}}</ref> He was bred in [[Ontario]] by Canadian business magnate [[E. P. Taylor|Edward P. Taylor]], owner of Windfields Farm. He was from the first crop of [[Nearctic (horse)|Nearctic]] and was the first foal out of the mare [[Natalma]], whose sire was [[Native Dancer]].<ref name=\"Nearctic\"/><ref name=\"Almahmoud\" /> \n\nAll Thoroughbreds in the Northern Hemisphere have an official birth date of January 1 but Northern Dancer was foaled late in the season on May 27, 1961. He was only {{hands|14}} high{{efn|The average height for a Thoroughbred, measured at the [[withers]], is about 16 hands (64 inches)}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Pedigree Analysis: Is Bigger Always Better? |url=https://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/108817/pedigree-analysis-is-bigger-always-better |website=BloodHorse.com |accessdate=5 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref> when Windfields Farm offered all of its [[Yearling (horse)|yearlings]] for sale at its annual auction. Despite a strong pedigree and good [[Horse conformation|conformation]], Northern Dancer did not find a buyer at his [[C$]]25,000 reserve price. As a result, Northern Dancer stayed in the Windfields Farm racing stable.<ref name=KingOfCanada /><ref name=\"CHoF\" />\n\nAt maturity, Northern Dancer had powerful quarters along with excellent balance and agility. His stallion listings showed his height as {{hands|15.2}}, but most horsemen who had met him estimated his height as between 15 and 15.1 hands.<ref name=ACP /> Shortly before the Kentucky Derby at age three, he weigh {{convert|940|lb|kg}}.<ref name=NYT-KDerby /> Like Nearctic and Nearco before him, Northern Dancer had a dominant and sometimes unruly temperament. \"He wasn't mean, but he would wheel and do some tricks,\" said Joe Thomas, who later managed the horse's stud career. Trainer [[Horatio Luro]] originally wanted to [[gelding|geld]] the colt, but Taylor refused.<ref name=\"Kocher\" />\n\nSportswriter Jim Murray of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote: \"Northern Dancer is the kind of colt who, if you saw him in your living room, you'd send for a trap and put cheese in it. He's so little, a cat would chase him. But he's so plucky there's barely room in him for his heart. His legs are barely long enough to keep his tail off the ground. He probably takes a hundred more strides than anyone else, but he's harder to pass than a third martini.\"<ref name=Kocher />\n\n==Racing career==\n\n===1963: Two-year-old season===\nOn August 2, 1963, Northern Dancer made his debut at [[Fort Erie Race Track]] in a [[maiden race]] for Canadian foaled two-year-olds over a distance of {{frac|5|1|2}} [[furlongs]]. He was ridden by apprentice jockey [[Ron Turcotte]], who was instructed not to use the whip but gave the colt a tap at the sixteenth pole anyway, whereupon Northern Dancer \"exploded\".<ref name=\"Timeline\">{{cite web|title=Northern Dancer a Very Unlikely Hero {{!}} Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame (archived version)|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181119152234/http://www.canadianhorseracinghalloffame.com:80/northern-dancer-timeline/|website=horseracinghalloffame.com|accessdate=4 December 2019}}</ref><ref name=Hunter86 /> He beat seven horses for a purse of $2,100.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fort Erie Race Track \u2013 Our History|url=http://www.forterieracing.com/about-us1/our-history/|website=www.forterieracing.com|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref> Turcotte later recalled, \"We won that race by eight [[Horse length|lengths]].

Paul Bohenko was his jockey since Turcotte was committed to another horse, Ramblin' Man. Northern Dancer entered into a speed duel at the start of the race, setting up the race for Ramblin' Man to come from behind and win.<ref name=Hunter86 /> After the race, Turcotte is quoted as having told Luro, \"the Dancer was definitely the best two year old in Canada, maybe in the world.\"<ref name=Timeline /> \n\nHe next entered the [[Summer Stakes (Canada)|Summer Stakes]] on August 24, then at a distance of 1 mile on the turf at [[Fort Erie]]. The track condition was described as 'bog-like', and Northern Dancer is said to have almost fallen. Despite struggling with the ground, he led from the start and hung on for the win.<ref name=Timeline />\n\nAfter a brief layoff, Northern Dancer was entered in the {{frac|1|1|16}} mile [[Cup and Saucer Stakes]] on September 28 over the [[Woodbine Racetrack|Woodbine]] turf course, where he was assigned the top weight of 124 pounds. Ron Turcotte was back as his jockey and took him to an early lead, but Northern Dancer tired and fell second to long-shot Grand Garcon by three-quarters of a length.<ref name=Timeline /> Turcotte believed the horse had still not recovered from the effort in the Summer Stakes and was favouring his left fore. \"He kept wanting to bear left, and I couldn't get him on his right lead at all.\"<ref name=\"Hunter, pg. 90\">Hunter, pg. 90</ref>\n\nOn October 7, he returned in the Bloordale Purse at 1 mile and 70 yards where he was again the top weight at 122 pounds. His main rival Northern Flight carried 117 pounds while other horses carried as little as 112 pounds. Northern Dancer broke well but allowed Northern Flight to take a commanding lead. At the halfway mark, Northern Dancer was third on the rail, 15 lengths back, but gradually closed the gap on the far turn. Down the stretch, the two battled for the lead before Northern Dancer pulled away to win by {{frac|1|1|2}} lengths, with the rest of the field some twenty-five plus lengths behind Northern Flight.<ref name=Timeline />\n\nOn October 12, Northern Dancer faced a field of 14 rivals in the [[Coronation Futurity Stakes]], the richest race for Canadian two-year-olds. He settled in fourth at the start, then took over the lead at the halfway point, drawing away to win by {{frac|6|1|4}} lengths. It was Turcotte's last ride on Northern Dancer, as Luro feared he could not maintain sufficient control of the headstrong colt. \"God knows how good [Northern Dancer] really was,\" recalled Turcotte, \"for he was never a completely sound horse most of the time I rode him, and I still could not slow him down more than that.\"<ref>Lennox, pp. 70\u201371</ref>\n\nOn November 6, Northern Dancer followed up with a win in the seven furlong Carleton Stakes at [[Greenwood Raceway|Greenwood]] on a muddy track. He won by {{frac|2|1|2}} lengths, but the ''[[Daily Racing Form]]'' called him an \"unwilling winner\", reflecting heavy pressure from new jockey Jimmy Fitzsimmons, who used the whip throughout the stretch drive. Northern Dancer came back to the barn bleeding from the beginning of a [[quarter crack]]. It was thought that the injury was a result of his heavy race schedule \u2013 seven races in three months.<ref name=\"Timeline\" />\n\nNonetheless, the colt was shipped to [[Aqueduct Racetrack]] in New York to compete against American horses. On November 18, he was entered in the Sir Gaylord Purse. He was ridden by [[Manuel Ycaza]], and won by eight lengths over Bupers, who had won the [[Belmont Futurity]]. However, the quarter crack became more pronounced, so he was fitted with a [[bar shoe]] on his left front [[horse hoof|hoof]] to stabilize the foot.<ref name=Timeline />\n\nOn November 27, Northern Dancer was the odds-on favourite in a field of six horses entered in the [[Remsen Stakes]], despite carrying top weight of 124 pounds. Ycaza sent him to the lead early and he won by two lengths in [[Glossary of North American horse racing#W|wire-to-wire]] fashion. His time of 1:35{{frac|3|5}} for one mile was a new stakes record.<ref name=Remsen>{{cite web |last1=Nichols |first1=Joe |title=Northern Dancer, Despite a Hoof Injury, Sets Stake Record at Aqueduct  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1963/11/28/archives/margin-in-remsen-is-two-lengths-northern-dancer-despite-a-hoof.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=7 December 2019 |date=28 November 1963}}</ref> Ycaza later recalled him as an \"ideal horse for any kind of situation. He would do anything you asked.\"<ref>Hunter, pg.92</ref>\n\nHis record of seven wins from nine starts earned Northern Dancer the [[Canadian Champion Two-Year-Old Colt|Canadian Juvenile Championship]]. He was rated at 126 pounds in the Canadian Free Handicap for two-year-olds, five pounds above Ramblin Road. In the American [[Experimental Free Handicap]], he was rated at 123 pounds \u2013 three pounds below champion [[Raise a Native]].<ref name=\"ACP\">{{cite web|last1=Hunter|first1=Avalyn|title=Northern Dancer|url=http://www.americanclassicpedigrees.com/northern-dancer-can.html|website=American Classic Pedigrees|accessdate=3 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n===1964: Three-year-old season===\nAfter the Remsen, Luro gave Northern Dancer some time off to heal and had a [[vulcanized rubber]] patch applied to the quarter crack. Northern Dancer recovered quickly and reentered training in January.<ref name=Timeline />\n\nHis first race at three was on February 10, 1964 in a six-furlong prep at [[Hialeah Park]] under a new jockey, [[Bobby Ussery]], who was instructed to take it easy and not use the whip. Northern Dancer was bumped at the start and fell to the back of the pack. He recovered and steadily advanced up the rail, only to become trapped behind several horses. He was bumped again and eventually finished third behind Chieftain. Despite the instructions of Luro, Ussury had taken to his whip in the final strides of the race, which led the trainer to publicly criticize the rider.<ref name=Timeline /> \"I believe in being very patient with my horses,\" said Luro. \"I don't want punishment \u2013 under no circumstances.\"<ref name=\"SILuro\">{{cite web|last1=Wright|first1=Alfred|title=The Continental Touch of Horation Luro|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/05/04/606807/the-continental-touch-of-senor-horatio-luro|website=si.com|accessdate=6 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn February 24, Northern Dancer and Chieftain again faced each other in a public workout over seven furlongs at Hialeah. Northern Dancer broke slowly but soon took the lead and won by seven lengths in a time of 1:23{{frac|2|5}}. He continued to gallop out past the wire, completing one mile in 1:36{{frac|2|5}} and nine furlongs in 1:50{{frac|4|5}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=Northern Dancer Beats Chieftain, Trader in Hialeah Test; Canadian Colt's Stock Rises After Impressive Triumph in 7\u2010Furlong Workout |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/02/25/archives/northern-dancer-beats-chieftain-trader-in-hialeah-test-flamingo.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=25 February 1964}}</ref>\n\nFor his next start in the [[Flamingo Stakes]] on March 3, Northern Dancer was ridden by Hall of Fame jockey [[Bill Shoemaker]] and went off as the even-money favourite in a field of eleven. He settled into second and moved to the lead in the stretch after some gentle urging by Shoemaker, winning by two lengths over Mr. Brick, with Quadrangle a further eight lengths back in third. His time of 1:47{{frac|4|5}} was the second fastest in the history of the race, behind only [[Bold Ruler]]'s time of 1:47 flat. Shoemaker was pleased with the performance. \"My little horse got a little leg weary in the last sixteenth of a mile,\" he said, \"but that was natural. He wasn't quite so seasoned as some of the other horses.\"<ref name=\"Flamingo\">{{cite web |title=Northern Dancer Takes $138,200 Flamingo by 2 Lengths |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/03/04/archives/northern-dancer-takes-138200-flamingo-by-2-lengths-shoemaker-rides.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=4 March 1964}}</ref>\n\nHe then entered a seven-furlong allowance race at [[Gulfstream Park]] on March 28 as a prep for the [[Florida Derby]]. Shoemaker was unable to ride due to a previous commitment, so Ycaza got the ride.

With Shoemaker back up, Northern Dancer raced in mid-pack behind a slow pace, then started to make up ground on the rail. Shoemaker waited until the half mile pole then urged the colt on without using the whip. Norther Dancer quickly took the lead at the head of the stretch and then held off a challenge by The Scoundrel, eventually winning by a length. Shoemaker said later that the colt was improving.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=The Dancer, The Scoundrel \u2013 and Mr. Moon|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/04/13/614442/the-dancer-the-scoundreland-mr-moon|website=si.com|accessdate=6 July 2016}}</ref> However, his time was a disappointing 1:50{{frac|4|5}}, the slowest Florida Derby since 1955. Joe Hirsch of the ''Daily Racing Form'' commented, \"It did not appear that Shoemaker had a lot of horse left at the wire.\"<ref name=\"Timeline\" /> Luro was satisfied with the performance though, feeling that the slow time of the race was the result of a fast workout a few days earlier in which Northern Dancer had fought restraint by the exercise rider.<ref name=\"FlaDerby\">{{cite web |title=Northern Dancer Wins Big Gulfstream Race \u2014 Shoemaker Aboard |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/04/05/archives/the-scoundrel-2d-northern-dancer-wins-big-gulfstream-raceshoemaker.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=5 April 1964}}</ref>\n\nShortly after the race, Luro asked Shoemaker to commit to riding Northern Dancer in the [[Kentucky Derby]]. But Shoemaker instead chose [[Hill Rise]], who had won the [[San Felipe Stakes]] and the [[Santa Anita Derby]] in California. Shoemaker had never ridden Hill Rise but campaigned hard to get the mount, believing the colt represented his best chance for a Derby win. Ycaza was also unable to commit to Northern Dancer as another trainer had first call on his services. Ultimately, Luro settled on [[Bill Hartack]], who had ridden Luro's previous Kentucky Derby winner, [[Decidedly]].<ref>Hunter, pp. 101\u2013103</ref> \"I'm not upset about it at all,\" said Luro. \"I guess Shoemaker must not have been impressed with my horse's race Saturday, but I believe it was far from his best effort.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Kentucky Derby Jockeys in a Shift; Shoemaker Switches From Northern Dancer to Hill Rise for Kentucky Derby |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/04/07/archives/kentucky-derby-jockeys-in-a-shift-shoemaker-switches-from-northern.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=7 April 1964}}</ref>\n\nWith his new jockey, Northern Dancer was made the 1\u20135 favourite in a field of five in the [[Blue Grass Stakes]] at [[Keeneland]] on April 23. With Northern Dancer so heavily backed, only win betting was allowed. Northern Dancer rated in second behind a slow early pace until the head of the stretch when he coasted to the lead. Another horse, Allen Adair, made a run down the stretch so Hartack released his grip and Northern Dancer crossed the finish line in front by half a length. He completed the nine furlongs in a time of 1:49{{frac|4|5}} and galloped out the Derby distance of ten furlongs in 2:03. Hartack was satisfied with the colt's abilities. \"He is a small horse,\" said Hartack, \"but he has lots of brawn and lots of guts.\"<ref name=\"BlueGrass\">{{cite web |title=Favored Northern Dancer Takes Blue Grass by Half a Length Under Hartack  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/04/24/archives/favored-northern-dancer-takes-blue-grass-by-half-a-length-under.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=24 April 1964}}</ref><ref>Hunter, pg. 104</ref>\n\n====Bidding for the Triple Crown====\nFor the [[1964 Kentucky Derby]], run at a distance of {{frac|1|1|4}} miles, Northern Dancer drew post position 7 in a field of 12. He was the second betting choice at odds of 7\u20132 behind Hill Rise at 7\u20135.<ref name=NYT-KDerby /> In the high pressure environment leading up to the race, Luro kept the press away from the colt, even substituting a stable pony for Northern Dancer during photo sessions. Northern Dancer responded by training eagerly, with a final workout of 1:00{{frac|2|5}} on April 20.<ref >Hunter, pp. 105\u2013107</ref>\n\nOn the day of the race, May 2, Northern Dancer was on edge. As the field reached the track, he \"bounced like a rubber ball\" and gave a huge buck when the band started to play \"[[My Old Kentucky Home]]\". He settled during the warm up, only to balk when asked to enter the starting gate. After a few tense moments, Northern Dancer relaxed and loaded quietly.<ref name=Timeline /><ref>Hunter, pp. 108\u2013109</ref> After the break, he settled into good position on the rail around the first turn behind the early pacemakers Mr. Brick and Royal. Down the backstretch, Hartack guided him through a narrow hole into the clear and started to make up ground on the leaders. He got the jump on Hill Rise, who became tangled up in traffic as the front-runners started to fade. With a quarter mile to go, Hartack urged his colt on; Northern Dancer responded by running the next furlong in a very fast 11 seconds. He had a lead of about two lengths, but Hill Rise had gotten in the clear and started to make up ground.<ref name=SIKentucky>{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=The Dancer Dazzles Old Kentucky|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/05/11/607195/the-dancer-dazzles-old-kentucky|website=si.com|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref> Author [[Kevin Chong]] later wrote of Northern Dancer's \"short, powerful legs making like a hummingbird's wings\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Izenberg|first1=Dafna|title=Northern Dancer: a legendary Canadian horse|url=http://www.macleans.ca/culture/books/living-on-the-coast-waiting-for-the-big-one/|website=macleans.ca|accessdate=3 July 2016|date=17 April 2014}}</ref> as he ran down the stretch.

He really did some running from the quarter pole to the eighth pole, and he was running his gamest at the wire.\"<ref name=\"NYT-KDerby\">{{cite web |title=Northern Dancer Wins Kentucky Derby by a Neck|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/05/03/archives/northern-dancer-wins-kentucky-derby-by-a-neck-yanks-lose-to.html |website=The New York Times |first=Joe|last=Nichols|accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=3 May 1964}}</ref>\n\nWith the [[Preakness Stakes]] being run just two weeks later, Luro was concerned that Northern Dancer would find the race more demanding, especially because the track at [[Pimlico Race Course|Pimlico]] was deep and taxing. Accordingly, he used long gallops of between two and three miles to build up stamina. Then on the Friday before the race, he \"blew out\" Northern Dancer with a 3-furlong workout in a brisk :35{{frac|3|5}} to sharpen his speed.<ref name=\"SIPreakness\">{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=Three for the Triple Crown|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/05/25/625173/three-for-the-triple-crown|website=si.com|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nFor the Preakness on May 16, Northern Dancer went off as the 2\u20131 second favourite to Hill Rise in a field of six that included the top five finishers from the Derby plus [[Quadrangle (horse)|Quadrangle]]. Northern Dancer settled into third place with Hill Rise tracking just behind. Quadrangle moved to the lead down the backstretch and Northern Dancer started to make his move around the far turn. Hartack had yet to ask Northern Dancer for his run, while the jockeys of both Hill Rise and Quadrangle were working hard to maintain their position. Turning into the stretch, Hartack hit Northern Dancer once and he surged to a commanding lead. Near the finish line, Northern Dancer started to tire but Hartack was not overly worried. \"If he was tired, the horses behind us would be even more tired,\" he explained. Northern Dancer won by two and a half lengths. Hill Rise finished third, caught at the wire by The Scoundrel who claimed second.<ref name=SIPreakness />\n\nNorthern Dancer celebrated his actual third birthday on May 27 and was presented with a cake of carrots adorned by Canadian flags. He also received hundreds of cards wishing him success in the upcoming Belmont Stakes. Taylor felt that the horse would not mind the distance of 12 furlongs, believing that Hartack would be able to judge the pace and conserve energy. Luro was more worried, believing that Northern Dancer's best distance was between eight and nine furlongs, but hoped the horse's class would be enough to carry him the extra distance.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=One More to Make It Nine|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/06/08/606850/one-more-to-make-it-nine|website=si.com|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith a Triple Crown at stake, a then-record crowd of 61,215 showed up for the [[Belmont Stakes]] on June 6, run that year at Aqueduct due to renovations at Belmont Park. Northern Dancer went off as the 4\u20135 favourite in a field of eight, with Hill Rise the second choice at 2\u20131 and Quadrangle at 13\u20132. With Northern Dancer under a tight hold, he and Hill Rise tracked each other for the first mile behind a slow pace set by outsider Orientalist. Quadrangle was in second, relaxed and saving ground with excellent position on the rail. After a mile in 1:39{{frac|1|5}}, Quadrangle's jockey made his move, confident his horse had enough stamina to outlast the others. Hartack on Northern Dancer and Shoemaker on Hill Rise appeared to underestimate Quadrangle and did not at first respond, allowing Quadrangle to build a substantial lead into the stretch. When finally asked to run, Northern Dancer closed the gap to within half a length in midstretch. However, he then tired and was passed by Roman Brother to finish third, some six lengths behind the winner. Shoemaker on Hill Rise, who finished fourth, lodged an objection against Hartack for being squeezed off on the final turn but the stewards disallowed the claim. The time of 2:28{{frac|2|5}} was just two-fifths of a second off the track record.<ref name=NYT-Belmont /><ref name=\"SIBelmont\">{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=SI Vault \u2013 Taken for a Virginia Reel|url=https://www.si.com/vault/issue/42846/44/2|website=www.si.com|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nHartack said he had been worried about several horses, including Quadrangle, before the race and felt the distance was the decisive factor. Asked if he felt disappointed by the result, he replied, \"How can it be a disappointment when a horse runs his heart out for you? He certainly didn't disgrace himself \u2013 not to me, anyway.\"<ref name=NYT-Belmont />\n\n====Return to Canada====\nIn spite of the loss in the Belmont, the mayor of [[Toronto]] declared June 8, 1964 to be \"Northern Dancer Day\", which included a ceremony held at city hall.

He raced from well off the pace, trailing the field around the first turn and still in sixth down the backstretch.

The first crop reached racing age in 1968 and was an immediate success, including [[Viceregal (horse)|Viceregal]], who was named Canadian Horse of the Year. Nine others also became [[Stakes race|stakes winners]], an \"astounding\" 47.6% of the crop.<ref>Hunter, pp. 127\u2013129</ref> \"His first foals ran so well,\" said Ed Bowen, former editor of ''The Blood-Horse''. \"Northern Dancer had that aura about him right away.\" <ref name=Kocher />\n\nAlthough his second crop produced only four stakes winners, it played a crucial role in his developing reputation. His leading performer was Nijinsky, who was purchased by Irish trainer [[Vincent O'Brien]] at the Canadian yearling sale for $84,000. Nijinsky went on to win the 1970 [[English Triple Crown]], the first horse to do so since 1935. Nijinsky was named Horse of the Year in England and Ireland. Meanwhile, [[Fanfreluche]] was named Canadian Horse of the Year and co-champion three year-old-filly in both Canada and the United States.<ref>Hunter, pp. 130\u2013134</ref>\n\nAs the result of his success, Northern Dancer was relocated to the Maryland division of Windfields Farms and was syndicated in August 1970 for $2.4 million. Taylor retained several shares in the stallion, while other members included [[Claiborne Farm]], [[Allaire du Pont]], [[Greentree Stable|Greentree Stud]], [[J. Louis Levesque]], [[Paul Mellon]], [[Spendthrift Farm]], [[Tartan Stable|Tartan Farm]] and [[Alfred G.

As a result of the scarcity of his services and his continued success, Northern Dancer's stud fee rose, slowly at first: from $10,000 (live foal) in 1965, to $15,000 (live foal) in 1969, to $25,000 (live foal) in 1971 to $35,000 ($10,000 of which was non-refundable) in 1975 to $50,000 (no guarantee) in 1978. His published fee, with no guarantee that a live foal would result, then started a rapid increase: $100,000 in 1980, $150,000 in 1981, $250,000 in 1982, $300,000 in 1983 and $500,000 in 1984.

He then became one of the most successful [[Stallion|sires]] of the 20th century. He is considered a Canadian icon, and was inducted into the [[Canadian Sports Hall of Fame]] in 1965. Induction into the Racing Hall of Fame in both Canada and the United States followed in 1976. As a competitor, ''[[The Blood-Horse]]'' ranked him as one of the [[Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century|top 100 U.S. Thoroughbred racehorses of the 20th century]]. As a sire of sires, his impact on the breed is still felt worldwide.\n\nAt age two, Northern Dancer was named the [[Canadian Champion Two-Year-Old Colt]] after winning both the [[Summer Stakes (Canada)|Summer Stakes]] and [[Coronation Futurity]] in Canada, plus the [[Remsen Stakes]] in New York. At three, he became a leading contender for the Kentucky Derby with wins in the [[Flamingo Stakes]], [[Florida Derby]], and [[Blue Grass Stakes]]. Northern Dancer followed up a narrow victory in the Kentucky Derby by winning the [[Preakness Stakes]]. With a chance at the [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)|American Triple Crown]], he finished third in the [[Belmont Stakes]]. Returning to Canada for a hero's welcome, he then won the [[Queen's Plate]] in what proved to be his last race.\n\nNorthern Dancer retired to stud in 1965 at [[Windfields Farm]] in Canada. He was an immediate success when his first crop reached racing age in 1968, and the success of his second crop, led by [[English Triple Crown]] winner [[Nijinsky (horse)|Nijinsky]], brought his name to the international stage. Northern Dancer was relocated to the Maryland branch of Windfields Farm, where he became the most sought sire of his time.\n\n==Background==\nNorthern Dancer was a [[Bay (horse)|bay]] [[stallion]] with a crooked white [[Horse markings#Facial markings|blaze]] and three white [[Horse markings#Leg markings|socks]].<ref name=\"KingOfCanada\">{{cite web |title=The King of Canada: Northern Dancer |url=https://horsenetwork.com/2017/06/king-canada-northern-dancer/ |website=Horse Network |accessdate=13 January 2020 |date=28 June 2017}}</ref> He was bred in [[Ontario]] by Canadian business magnate [[E. P. Taylor|Edward P. Taylor]], owner of Windfields Farm. He was from the first crop of [[Nearctic (horse)|Nearctic]] and was the first foal out of the mare [[Natalma]], whose sire was [[Native Dancer]].<ref name=\"Nearctic\"/><ref name=\"Almahmoud\" /> \n\nAll Thoroughbreds in the Northern Hemisphere have an official birth date of January 1 but Northern Dancer was foaled late in the season on May 27, 1961. He was only {{hands|14}} high{{efn|The average height for a Thoroughbred, measured at the [[withers]], is about 16 hands (64 inches)}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Pedigree Analysis: Is Bigger Always Better? |url=https://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/108817/pedigree-analysis-is-bigger-always-better |website=BloodHorse.com |accessdate=5 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref> when Windfields Farm offered all of its [[Yearling (horse)|yearlings]] for sale at its annual auction. Despite a strong pedigree and good [[Horse conformation|conformation]], Northern Dancer did not find a buyer at his [[C$]]25,000 reserve price. As a result, Northern Dancer stayed in the Windfields Farm racing stable.<ref name=KingOfCanada /><ref name=\"CHoF\" />\n\nAt maturity, Northern Dancer had powerful quarters along with excellent balance and agility. His stallion listings showed his height as {{hands|15.2}}, but most horsemen who had met him estimated his height as between 15 and 15.1 hands.<ref name=ACP /> Shortly before the Kentucky Derby at age three, he weigh {{convert|940|lb|kg}}.<ref name=NYT-KDerby /> Like Nearctic and Nearco before him, Northern Dancer had a dominant and sometimes unruly temperament. \"He wasn't mean, but he would wheel and do some tricks,\" said Joe Thomas, who later managed the horse's stud career. Trainer [[Horatio Luro]] originally wanted to [[gelding|geld]] the colt, but Taylor refused.<ref name=\"Kocher\" />\n\nSportswriter Jim Murray of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote: \"Northern Dancer is the kind of colt who, if you saw him in your living room, you'd send for a trap and put cheese in it. He's so little, a cat would chase him. But he's so plucky there's barely room in him for his heart. His legs are barely long enough to keep his tail off the ground. He probably takes a hundred more strides than anyone else, but he's harder to pass than a third martini.\"<ref name=Kocher />\n\n==Racing career==\n\n===1963: Two-year-old season===\nOn August 2, 1963, Northern Dancer made his debut at [[Fort Erie Race Track]] in a [[maiden race]] for Canadian foaled two-year-olds over a distance of {{frac|5|1|2}} [[furlongs]].

Paul Bohenko was his jockey since Turcotte was committed to another horse, Ramblin' Man. Northern Dancer entered into a speed duel at the start of the race, setting up the race for Ramblin' Man to come from behind and win.<ref name=Hunter86 /> After the race, Turcotte is quoted as having told Luro, \"the Dancer was definitely the best two year old in Canada, maybe in the world.\"<ref name=Timeline /> \n\nHe next entered the [[Summer Stakes (Canada)|Summer Stakes]] on August 24, then at a distance of 1 mile on the turf at [[Fort Erie]]. The track condition was described as 'bog-like', and Northern Dancer is said to have almost fallen. Despite struggling with the ground, he led from the start and hung on for the win.<ref name=Timeline />\n\nAfter a brief layoff, Northern Dancer was entered in the {{frac|1|1|16}} mile [[Cup and Saucer Stakes]] on September 28 over the [[Woodbine Racetrack|Woodbine]] turf course, where he was assigned the top weight of 124 pounds. Ron Turcotte was back as his jockey and took him to an early lead, but Northern Dancer tired and fell second to long-shot Grand Garcon by three-quarters of a length.<ref name=Timeline /> Turcotte believed the horse had still not recovered from the effort in the Summer Stakes and was favouring his left fore. \"He kept wanting to bear left, and I couldn't get him on his right lead at all.\"<ref name=\"Hunter, pg. 90\">Hunter, pg. 90</ref>\n\nOn October 7, he returned in the Bloordale Purse at 1 mile and 70 yards where he was again the top weight at 122 pounds. His main rival Northern Flight carried 117 pounds while other horses carried as little as 112 pounds. Northern Dancer broke well but allowed Northern Flight to take a commanding lead. At the halfway mark, Northern Dancer was third on the rail, 15 lengths back, but gradually closed the gap on the far turn. Down the stretch, the two battled for the lead before Northern Dancer pulled away to win by {{frac|1|1|2}} lengths, with the rest of the field some twenty-five plus lengths behind Northern Flight.<ref name=Timeline />\n\nOn October 12, Northern Dancer faced a field of 14 rivals in the [[Coronation Futurity Stakes]], the richest race for Canadian two-year-olds. He settled in fourth at the start, then took over the lead at the halfway point, drawing away to win by {{frac|6|1|4}} lengths. It was Turcotte's last ride on Northern Dancer, as Luro feared he could not maintain sufficient control of the headstrong colt. \"God knows how good [Northern Dancer] really was,\" recalled Turcotte, \"for he was never a completely sound horse most of the time I rode him, and I still could not slow him down more than that.\"<ref>Lennox, pp. 70\u201371</ref>\n\nOn November 6, Northern Dancer followed up with a win in the seven furlong Carleton Stakes at [[Greenwood Raceway|Greenwood]] on a muddy track. He won by {{frac|2|1|2}} lengths, but the ''[[Daily Racing Form]]'' called him an \"unwilling winner\", reflecting heavy pressure from new jockey Jimmy Fitzsimmons, who used the whip throughout the stretch drive. Northern Dancer came back to the barn bleeding from the beginning of a [[quarter crack]]. It was thought that the injury was a result of his heavy race schedule \u2013 seven races in three months.<ref name=\"Timeline\" />\n\nNonetheless, the colt was shipped to [[Aqueduct Racetrack]] in New York to compete against American horses. On November 18, he was entered in the Sir Gaylord Purse. He was ridden by [[Manuel Ycaza]], and won by eight lengths over Bupers, who had won the [[Belmont Futurity]]. However, the quarter crack became more pronounced, so he was fitted with a [[bar shoe]] on his left front [[horse hoof|hoof]] to stabilize the foot.<ref name=Timeline />\n\nOn November 27, Northern Dancer was the odds-on favourite in a field of six horses entered in the [[Remsen Stakes]], despite carrying top weight of 124 pounds. Ycaza sent him to the lead early and he won by two lengths in [[Glossary of North American horse racing#W|wire-to-wire]] fashion.

He was rated at 126 pounds in the Canadian Free Handicap for two-year-olds, five pounds above Ramblin Road. In the American [[Experimental Free Handicap]], he was rated at 123 pounds \u2013 three pounds below champion [[Raise a Native]].<ref name=\"ACP\">{{cite web|last1=Hunter|first1=Avalyn|title=Northern Dancer|url=http://www.americanclassicpedigrees.com/northern-dancer-can.html|website=American Classic Pedigrees|accessdate=3 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n===1964: Three-year-old season===\nAfter the Remsen, Luro gave Northern Dancer some time off to heal and had a [[vulcanized rubber]] patch applied to the quarter crack. Northern Dancer recovered quickly and reentered training in January.<ref name=Timeline />\n\nHis first race at three was on February 10, 1964 in a six-furlong prep at [[Hialeah Park]] under a new jockey, [[Bobby Ussery]], who was instructed to take it easy and not use the whip. Northern Dancer was bumped at the start and fell to the back of the pack. He recovered and steadily advanced up the rail, only to become trapped behind several horses. He was bumped again and eventually finished third behind Chieftain. Despite the instructions of Luro, Ussury had taken to his whip in the final strides of the race, which led the trainer to publicly criticize the rider.<ref name=Timeline /> \"I believe in being very patient with my horses,\" said Luro. \"I don't want punishment \u2013 under no circumstances.\"<ref name=\"SILuro\">{{cite web|last1=Wright|first1=Alfred|title=The Continental Touch of Horation Luro|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/05/04/606807/the-continental-touch-of-senor-horatio-luro|website=si.com|accessdate=6 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn February 24, Northern Dancer and Chieftain again faced each other in a public workout over seven furlongs at Hialeah. Northern Dancer broke slowly but soon took the lead and won by seven lengths in a time of 1:23{{frac|2|5}}.

He settled into second and moved to the lead in the stretch after some gentle urging by Shoemaker, winning by two lengths over Mr. Brick, with Quadrangle a further eight lengths back in third. His time of 1:47{{frac|4|5}} was the second fastest in the history of the race, behind only [[Bold Ruler]]'s time of 1:47 flat. Shoemaker was pleased with the performance. \"My little horse got a little leg weary in the last sixteenth of a mile,\" he said, \"but that was natural.

With Shoemaker back up, Northern Dancer raced in mid-pack behind a slow pace, then started to make up ground on the rail. Shoemaker waited until the half mile pole then urged the colt on without using the whip. Norther Dancer quickly took the lead at the head of the stretch and then held off a challenge by The Scoundrel, eventually winning by a length.

Joe Hirsch of the ''Daily Racing Form'' commented, \"It did not appear that Shoemaker had a lot of horse left at the wire.\"<ref name=\"Timeline\" /> Luro was satisfied with the performance though, feeling that the slow time of the race was the result of a fast workout a few days earlier in which Northern Dancer had fought restraint by the exercise rider.<ref name=\"FlaDerby\">{{cite web |title=Northern Dancer Wins Big Gulfstream Race \u2014 Shoemaker Aboard |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/04/05/archives/the-scoundrel-2d-northern-dancer-wins-big-gulfstream-raceshoemaker.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=5 April 1964}}</ref>\n\nShortly after the race, Luro asked Shoemaker to commit to riding Northern Dancer in the [[Kentucky Derby]].

Another horse, Allen Adair, made a run down the stretch so Hartack released his grip and Northern Dancer crossed the finish line in front by half a length.

Hartack was satisfied with the colt's abilities. \"He is a small horse,\" said Hartack, \"but he has lots of brawn and lots of guts.\"<ref name=\"BlueGrass\">{{cite web |title=Favored Northern Dancer Takes Blue Grass by Half a Length Under Hartack  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/04/24/archives/favored-northern-dancer-takes-blue-grass-by-half-a-length-under.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=24 April 1964}}</ref><ref>Hunter, pg. 104</ref>\n\n====Bidding for the Triple Crown====\nFor the [[1964 Kentucky Derby]], run at a distance of {{frac|1|1|4}} miles, Northern Dancer drew post position 7 in a field of 12. He was the second betting choice at odds of 7\u20132 behind Hill Rise at 7\u20135.<ref name=NYT-KDerby /> In the high pressure environment leading up to the race, Luro kept the press away from the colt, even substituting a stable pony for Northern Dancer during photo sessions. Northern Dancer responded by training eagerly, with a final workout of 1:00{{frac|2|5}} on April 20.<ref >Hunter, pp. 105\u2013107</ref>\n\nOn the day of the race, May 2, Northern Dancer was on edge. As the field reached the track, he \"bounced like a rubber ball\" and gave a huge buck when the band started to play \"[[My Old Kentucky Home]]\". He settled during the warm up, only to balk when asked to enter the starting gate. After a few tense moments, Northern Dancer relaxed and loaded quietly.<ref name=Timeline /><ref>Hunter, pp. 108\u2013109</ref> After the break, he settled into good position on the rail around the first turn behind the early pacemakers Mr. Brick and Royal. Down the backstretch, Hartack guided him through a narrow hole into the clear and started to make up ground on the leaders. He got the jump on Hill Rise, who became tangled up in traffic as the front-runners started to fade. With a quarter mile to go, Hartack urged his colt on; Northern Dancer responded by running the next furlong in a very fast 11 seconds. He had a lead of about two lengths, but Hill Rise had gotten in the clear and started to make up ground.<ref name=SIKentucky>{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=The Dancer Dazzles Old Kentucky|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/05/11/607195/the-dancer-dazzles-old-kentucky|website=si.com|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref> Author [[Kevin Chong]] later wrote of Northern Dancer's \"short, powerful legs making like a hummingbird's wings\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Izenberg|first1=Dafna|title=Northern Dancer: a legendary Canadian horse|url=http://www.macleans.ca/culture/books/living-on-the-coast-waiting-for-the-big-one/|website=macleans.ca|accessdate=3 July 2016|date=17 April 2014}}</ref> as he ran down the stretch.

He really did some running from the quarter pole to the eighth pole, and he was running his gamest at the wire.\"<ref name=\"NYT-KDerby\">{{cite web |title=Northern Dancer Wins Kentucky Derby by a Neck|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/05/03/archives/northern-dancer-wins-kentucky-derby-by-a-neck-yanks-lose-to.html |website=The New York Times |first=Joe|last=Nichols|accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=3 May 1964}}</ref>\n\nWith the [[Preakness Stakes]] being run just two weeks later, Luro was concerned that Northern Dancer would find the race more demanding, especially because the track at [[Pimlico Race Course|Pimlico]] was deep and taxing. Accordingly, he used long gallops of between two and three miles to build up stamina. Then on the Friday before the race, he \"blew out\" Northern Dancer with a 3-furlong workout in a brisk :35{{frac|3|5}} to sharpen his speed.<ref name=\"SIPreakness\">{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=Three for the Triple Crown|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/05/25/625173/three-for-the-triple-crown|website=si.com|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nFor the Preakness on May 16, Northern Dancer went off as the 2\u20131 second favourite to Hill Rise in a field of six that included the top five finishers from the Derby plus [[Quadrangle (horse)|Quadrangle]]. Northern Dancer settled into third place with Hill Rise tracking just behind. Quadrangle moved to the lead down the backstretch and Northern Dancer started to make his move around the far turn. Hartack had yet to ask Northern Dancer for his run, while the jockeys of both Hill Rise and Quadrangle were working hard to maintain their position. Turning into the stretch, Hartack hit Northern Dancer once and he surged to a commanding lead. Near the finish line, Northern Dancer started to tire but Hartack was not overly worried. \"If he was tired, the horses behind us would be even more tired,\" he explained. Northern Dancer won by two and a half lengths. Hill Rise finished third, caught at the wire by The Scoundrel who claimed second.<ref name=SIPreakness />\n\nNorthern Dancer celebrated his actual third birthday on May 27 and was presented with a cake of carrots adorned by Canadian flags. He also received hundreds of cards wishing him success in the upcoming Belmont Stakes. Taylor felt that the horse would not mind the distance of 12 furlongs, believing that Hartack would be able to judge the pace and conserve energy. Luro was more worried, believing that Northern Dancer's best distance was between eight and nine furlongs, but hoped the horse's class would be enough to carry him the extra distance.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=One More to Make It Nine|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/06/08/606850/one-more-to-make-it-nine|website=si.com|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith a Triple Crown at stake, a then-record crowd of 61,215 showed up for the [[Belmont Stakes]] on June 6, run that year at Aqueduct due to renovations at Belmont Park. Northern Dancer went off as the 4\u20135 favourite in a field of eight, with Hill Rise the second choice at 2\u20131 and Quadrangle at 13\u20132. With Northern Dancer under a tight hold, he and Hill Rise tracked each other for the first mile behind a slow pace set by outsider Orientalist. Quadrangle was in second, relaxed and saving ground with excellent position on the rail. After a mile in 1:39{{frac|1|5}}, Quadrangle's jockey made his move, confident his horse had enough stamina to outlast the others. Hartack on Northern Dancer and Shoemaker on Hill Rise appeared to underestimate Quadrangle and did not at first respond, allowing Quadrangle to build a substantial lead into the stretch. When finally asked to run, Northern Dancer closed the gap to within half a length in midstretch. However, he then tired and was passed by Roman Brother to finish third, some six lengths behind the winner. Shoemaker on Hill Rise, who finished fourth, lodged an objection against Hartack for being squeezed off on the final turn but the stewards disallowed the claim. The time of 2:28{{frac|2|5}} was just two-fifths of a second off the track record.<ref name=NYT-Belmont /><ref name=\"SIBelmont\">{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=SI Vault \u2013 Taken for a Virginia Reel|url=https://www.si.com/vault/issue/42846/44/2|website=www.si.com|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nHartack said he had been worried about several horses, including Quadrangle, before the race and felt the distance was the decisive factor. Asked if he felt disappointed by the result, he replied, \"How can it be a disappointment when a horse runs his heart out for you? He certainly didn't disgrace himself \u2013 not to me, anyway.\"<ref name=NYT-Belmont />\n\n====Return to Canada====\nIn spite of the loss in the Belmont, the mayor of [[Toronto]] declared June 8, 1964 to be \"Northern Dancer Day\", which included a ceremony held at city hall. (The idea of a ticker-tape parade down [[Bay Street]] was nixed due to the colt's high strung temperament.)<ref name=\"KingOfCanada\" /><ref>Lennox, p. 104</ref> E. P. Taylor was presented with a key to the city\u2014carved out of a carrot.

He raced from well off the pace, trailing the field around the first turn and still in sixth down the backstretch.

The first crop reached racing age in 1968 and was an immediate success, including [[Viceregal (horse)|Viceregal]], who was named Canadian Horse of the Year. Nine others also became [[Stakes race|stakes winners]], an \"astounding\" 47.6% of the crop.<ref>Hunter, pp. 127\u2013129</ref> \"His first foals ran so well,\" said Ed Bowen, former editor of ''The Blood-Horse''. \"Northern Dancer had that aura about him right away.\" <ref name=Kocher />\n\nAlthough his second crop produced only four stakes winners, it played a crucial role in his developing reputation. His leading performer was Nijinsky, who was purchased by Irish trainer [[Vincent O'Brien]] at the Canadian yearling sale for $84,000. Nijinsky went on to win the 1970 [[English Triple Crown]], the first horse to do so since 1935. Nijinsky was named Horse of the Year in England and Ireland. Meanwhile, [[Fanfreluche]] was named Canadian Horse of the Year and co-champion three year-old-filly in both Canada and the United States.<ref>Hunter, pp. 130\u2013134</ref>\n\nAs the result of his success, Northern Dancer was relocated to the Maryland division of Windfields Farms and was syndicated in August 1970 for $2.4 million. Taylor retained several shares in the stallion, while other members included [[Claiborne Farm]], [[Allaire du Pont]], [[Greentree Stable|Greentree Stud]], [[J.

Filming consisted of wide landscape shots devoid of any live-action creatures and close-up shots with [[animatronics]]. The only creatures in the pilot that are not shown in the series are [[Cetiosaurus]] and [[Scaphognathus]].\n\nSince an extensive amount of [[computer-generated imagery]] would be necessary in creating the numerous full-size dinosaurs that the project demanded, Haines initially approached [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM), the company responsible for creating the visual effects in ''Jurassic Park''. ILM projected a cost of $10,000 per every second of footage featuring a CGI shot, an estimate which BBC deemed too expensive for a television budget. Instead, Haines contracted [[Framestore]], a local British visual effects company to create the CGI elements. Maquettes were built and then scanned, with the resulting 3D models animated in [[Softimage 3D]] and added to the live-action backgrounds. Framestore consulted several palaeontologists in assisting them with developing natural movements and appearances for the dinosaurs.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Huelsman|first1=Eric|title=Walking With Dinosaurs|url=http://www.awn.com/animationworld/walking-dinosaurs|accessdate=April 11, 2016|work=Animation World Network|date=1 March 2000}}</ref> [[Michael Benton]], [[Thomas R. Holtz, Jr.]], [[Peter Dodson]], [[Peter Larson]], David Martill, and James Farlow, served as consultants; their influence in the [[Cinematography|filming process]] was documented in the companion piece, ''The Making of Walking with Dinosaurs''. The CG work was created over the course of two years.\n\n===Scientific accuracy===\n\n==== Behaviour ====\nMichael J. Benton, a consultant to the making of the series and professor of [[Vertebrate paleontology|vertebrate palaeontology]] at the [[University of Bristol]], notes that a group of critics gleefully pointed out that birds and crocodiles, the closest living relatives of the dinosaurs, do not urinate; they shed waste chemicals as more solid [[uric acid]]. In the first episode of ''Walking with Dinosaurs'', a male ''[[Postosuchus]]'' urinates copiously to mark a female's territory as his own after she is driven away from it. However, Benton notes that nobody can prove this was a real mistake: copious urination is the primitive state for tetrapods (seen in fish, amphibians, turtles, and mammals), and perhaps basal [[archosaur]]s did the same. He believes many other claims of \"errors\" identified in the first weeks fizzled out, as the critics had found points about which they disagreed, but they could not prove that their views were correct.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20190307053944/http://palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk/Essays/WWD/default.html \"birds and crocodiles, the closest living relatives of the dinosaurs, do not urinate\".] Benton, M. J. 2001. \"The science of 'Walking with Dinosaurs'\". ''Teaching Earth Sciences'', 24, 371\u2013400.</ref>\n\n==== Anatomy ====\n''[[Ornitholestes]]'', a theropod dinosaur of the [[Late Jurassic]], is shown with a small crest atop its head. However, subsequent studies have concluded that it most likely did not have such a crest, and that the misconception that it did came as a result of broken nasal bones in the holotype.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n==== Size ====\n''[[Tropeognathus]]'' is depicted as far larger than it actually was. In the book based on the series, it was claimed that several large bone fragments from the [[Romualdo Formation]] of Brazil possibly indicate that ''Tropeognathus'' may have had a wingspan reaching almost 12 metres and a weight of a hundred kilograms, making it one of the largest known pterosaurs.<ref>Haines, T., 1999, ''\"Walking with Dinosaurs\": A Natural History'', BBC Books, p. 158</ref> However, these specimens have not been formally described. The largest definite ''Tropeognathus'' specimens known measure 6 metres in wingspan. The specimens which the producers of the programme used to justify such a large size estimate are currently undescribed, and are being studied by Dave Martill and David Unwin. Unwin stated that he does not believe this highest estimate is likely, and that the producers likely chose the highest possible estimate because it was more \"spectacular.\"<ref name=\"dmlbrdeow\">Bredow, H.P. (2000). \"[http://dml.cmnh.org/2000Apr/msg00446.html Re: WWD non-dino questions].\" Message to the Dinosaur Mailing List, 18 April 2000. Retrieved 20 January 2011: http://dml.cmnh.org/2000Apr/msg00446.html</ref> However, no other Early Cretaceous pterosaurs reached its size. Similarly, ''[[Liopleurodon]]'' is depicted as being 25&nbsp;m (82&nbsp;ft) long in the series, whereas the adult size known to have been reached by ''Liopleurodon'' is around 7&nbsp;m (23&nbsp;ft).<ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Adam|title=Liopleurodon|url=http://www.plesiosauria.com/liopleurodon.php|work=The Plesiosaur Directory|accessdate=11 March 2012}}</ref> This was also based on [[Monster of Aramberri|very fragmentary remains]] of which the 20 metre measurement given have been considered dubious, and it is unlikely that these remains belong to ''Liopleurodon''.\n\n==List of episodes==\n[[BBC One]] aired the series weekly on Monday nights, with a regular repeats the following Sunday.

Downstream, a male ''[[Thrinaxodon]]'' resides in a burrow with his family. A female ''[[Postosuchus]]'', a [[Rauisuchidae|rauisuchian]] and one of the largest carnivores alive in the [[Triassic]], attacks the ''Placerias'' herd, and wounds one individual; the herd scatters, leaving the wounded ''Placerias'' to the ''Postosuchus''. Early [[pterosaur]]s called ''[[Peteinosaurus]]'' are depicted feeding on [[Dragonfly|dragonflies]] and cooling themselves in the little water remaining during the drought. Still searching for food, the ''Coelophysis'' discover the ''Thrinaxodon'' burrow; the male wards them off. Later that evening, after he goes off hunting, an inquisitive pup follows the male to the entrance and is eaten by the female ''Coelophysis''. At night, the ''Thrinaxodon'' pair eat their remaining young and then move away. On the next day, the ''Coelophysis'' work to expose the nest. The female ''Postosuchus'' is later shown to have been wounded by the ''Placerias'', a prior attack on them leaving her with a tusk wound on her thigh. After being unable to successfully hunt another ''Placerias'', she is expelled from her territory by a rival male. Wounded, sick, and without a territory, the female dies and is eaten by a pack of ''Coelophysis''. As the dry season continues, food becomes scarce. The ''Placerias'' herd embarks on a journey in search of water, while the ''Coelophysis'' begin to [[cannibalism (zoology)|cannibalise]] their young, and the male ''Thrinaxodon'' also resorts to hunting baby ''Coelophysis'' at night. Finally, the wet season arrives; the majority of the ''Coelophysis'' have survived (including the lead female), and the ''Thrinaxodon'' pair have a new clutch of eggs. The episode ends with the arrival of a migrating herd of ''[[Plateosaurus]]'', foreshadowing the dominance of the [[sauropod]]s after the [[Triassic\u2013Jurassic extinction event]].\n\nIn the credits it is explained that 20 million years later, the aforementioned extinction wiped out many reptile species, but the dinosaurs continued to evolve, with carnivores growing to massive sizes and their prey becoming even larger, setting the stage for the giants of the Jurassic.\n\n{{flatlist|\n;Animals\n: ''[[Coelophysis]]''{{\u00b7}} ''[[Thrinaxodon]]'' (unnamed, identified as cynodont){{\u00b7}} ''[[Placerias]]''{{\u00b7}} ''[[Postosuchus]]''{{\u00b7}} ''[[Peteinosaurus]]''{{\u00b7}} ''[[Plateosaurus]]''{{\u00b7}} [[Lungfish]]{{\u00b7}} [[Dragonfly]]}}\n|LineColor = 9790BB\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber= 2\n| Title=Time of the Titans\n| RTitle =<ref name=\"Time of the Titans\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p008cm33|title=Time of the Titans - Walking with Dinosaurs, Original series Episode 2 of 6|website=}}</ref>\n| Aux1= 152 mya\n| DirectedBy= Tim Haines & Jasper James\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1999|10|11|df=y}}\n| Viewers= 17.75\n| ShortSummary= :152 million years ago, [[Late Jurassic]] ([[Colorado]])\n:Filming location: [[California State Parks]], [[Chile]], [[Tasmania]], New Zealand\n\nThis episode follows the life of a female ''[[Diplodocus]]'', beginning at the moment when her mother lays a clutch of eggs at the edge of a conifer forest. Months later, some of the eggs hatch; the young sauropods are preyed upon by ''[[Ornitholestes]]''. After hatching, the hatchlings retreat to the safety of the denser trees. They face many dangers as they grow, including predation by ''Ornitholestes'' and ''[[Allosaurus]]''. While fending off a pair of ''Allosaurus'', a ''[[Stegosaurus]]'' also accidentally kills one of the hatchlings while swinging its tail. Elsewhere, adult herds of ''Diplodocus'' are shown using their massive weight to topple trees in order to reach [[cycad]] leaves. Each ''Diplodocus'' hosts a small mobile habitat of [[damselfly|damselflies]], ''[[Anurognathus]]'', and [[dung beetle]]s. After some time, the creche of ''Diplodocus'' have grown into subadults. Nearly all are killed by a huge forest fire; only three survivors emerge onto the open plains, including the young female. They encounter several ''[[Brachiosaurus]]'' before two reach safety to a herd of adult ''Diplodocus''. Several years later, the female mates, and is attacked by a bull ''Allosaurus''. She is saved when another ''Diplodocus'' strikes the ''Allosaurus'' with its tail. Although she is wounded, she rejoins the herd. The closing narration notes that the sauropods will only get larger, becoming the largest animals ever to walk the Earth.\n\nIn the credits it is stated that the sauropods eventually went into decline with their prairies becoming flooded by rising sea levels, resulting in vast inland seas and the giant marine reptiles that patrolled them.\n\n{{flatlist|\n;Animals\n: ''[[Diplodocus]]''{{\u00b7}} ''[[Allosaurus]]''{{\u00b7}} ''[[Ornitholestes]]''{{\u00b7}} ''[[Stegosaurus]]''{{\u00b7}} ''[[Brachiosaurus]]''{{\u00b7}} ''[[Anurognathus]]''{{\u00b7}} ''[[Dryosaurus]]'' (unnamed){{\u00b7}} ''[[Othnielia]]'' (unnamed){{\u00b7}} [[Damselfly]] {{\u00b7}} [[Dung beetle]]}}\n|LineColor = 9790BB\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber= 3\n| Title=Cruel Sea\n| RTitle =<ref name=\"Cruel Sea\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p008cm6f|title=Cruel Sea - Walking with Dinosaurs, Original series Episode 3 of 6|website=bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n| Aux1= 149 mya\n| DirectedBy= Tim Haines & Jasper James\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1999|10|18|df=y}}\n| Viewers= 17.96\n| ShortSummary= [[File:Eustreptospondylus head.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Eustreptospondylus]]'' puppet head that was used in ''Walking with Dinosaurs'' at the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]]]]\n:149 million years ago, Late Jurassic ([[Oxfordshire]])\n:Filming location: The Bahamas, [[New Caledonia]]\n\nThe episode begins with a ''[[Eustreptospondylus]]'' being snatched from the shore by ''[[Liopleurodon]]''. Meanwhile, hundreds of ''[[Ophthalmosaurus]]'' arrive from the open ocean to give birth. ''[[Hybodus]]'' and a ''Liopleurodon'' are on the hunt; when a mother ''Ophthalmosaurus'' has trouble giving birth, a pair of ''Hybodus'' pursue her. They are frightened off by a male ''Liopleurodon'', which eats the front half of the [[ichthyosaur]]. Meanwhile, a ''Eustreptospondylus'' swims to an island and discovers a turtle carcass; it fights over the carcass with another ''Eustreptospondylus''. Later, during the night, a group of [[horseshoe crab]]s gather at the shore to lay their eggs, which attracts a flock of ''[[Rhamphorhynchus]]'' in the morning to eat the eggs. However, a few of the pterosaurs are caught and eaten by a ''Eustreptospondylus''. While the ''Ophthalmosaurus'' juveniles are growing up, they are hunted by ''Hybodus'', which in turn, are prey for the ''Liopleurodon''. While the male ''Liopleurodon'' is hunting, he encounters a female ''Liopleurodon''; after the male bites one of her flippers, she retreats from his territory, and a group of ''Hybodus'' follows the trail of her blood. A [[cyclone]] strikes the islands, killing many animals, including several ''Rhamphorhynchus'' and the ''Liopleurodon'', who is washed ashore and eventually suffocates under his own weight. A group of ''Eustreptospondylus'' feed on his carcass. At the end of the episode, the juvenile ''Ophthalmosaurus'' that survived the storm are now large enough to swim off and live in the open sea.\n\nIn the credits, it is stated that even though only turtles remain, marine reptiles were a glory of their age and that another group shared the dinosaur's world, the flying pterosaurs, which are claimed to be just as spectacular.\n\n{{flatlist|\n;Animals\n: ''[[Ophthalmosaurus]]''{{\u00b7}} ''[[Liopleurodon]]''{{\u00b7}} ''[[Eustreptospondylus]]''{{\u00b7}} ''[[Cryptoclidus]]''{{\u00b7}} ''[[Rhamphorhynchus]]''{{\u00b7}} ''[[Hybodus]]'' (unnamed, identified as shark){{\u00b7}} ''[[Perisphinctes]]'' (unnamed, identified as ammonite) {{\u00b7}} ''[[Leptolepis]]'' (unnamed) {{\u00b7}} Jellyfish {{\u00b7}} Bark beetle {{\u00b7}}[[Horseshoe crab]] {{\u00b7}} [[Squid]] \n}}\n|LineColor = 9790BB\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber= 4\n| Title=Giant of the Skies\n| RTitle =<ref name=\"Giant of the Skies\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p008cmk8|title=Giant of the Skies - Walking with Dinosaurs, Original series Episode 4 of 6|website=bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n| Aux1= 127 mya\n| DirectedBy= Tim Haines & Jasper James\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1999|10|25|df=y}}\n| Viewers= 16.8\n| ShortSummary= [[File:Pterosaur exhibit.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Tropeognathus]]'' puppet head that was used in ''Walking with Dinosaurs'' at the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]]]]\n:127 million years ago, [[Early Cretaceous]] ([[Brazil]], [[North America]], [[Europe]] and [[Cantabria]])\n:Filming location: New Zealand, [[Tasmania]]\n\nThe episode begins with a male ''[[Tropeognathus]]'' dead on a beach. Six months earlier, the ''Tropeognathus'', resting among a colony of breeding ''[[Tupandactylus]]'' in [[Brazil]], flies off for Cantabria where it too must mate. He flies past a [[animal migration|migrating]] group of the iguanodont ''[[Dakotadon]]'' and the nodosaur ''[[Polacanthus]]''. He reaches the southern tip of North America, where he is forced to shelter from a storm. He grooms himself, expelling his body of ''[[Saurophthirus]]'' fleas; the crest on his jaw begins to change colour in preparation for the mating season. He then sets off across the [[Atlantic]], which was then only 300 kilometres wide, and after a whole day on the wing, reaches the westernmost of the European islands. He does not rest there however, as a pack of ''[[Utahraptor]]'' are hunting ''[[Iguanodon]]''; a young ''Utahraptor'' is bullied off an ''Iguanodon'' carcass by the adults. The ''Tropeognathus'' flies to the outskirts of a forest to rest after stealing a fish from another pterosaur, but is driven away by ''[[Iberomesornis]]''. Flying on, he reaches Cantabria, but due to the delays, exhaustion, and old age he cannot reach the centre of the many grounded male ''Tropeognathus'' and consequently he does not mate. After several days under the sun trying to attract a mate, the protagonist ''Tropeognathus'' -alongside others who lost out- dies from heat exhaustion and starvation. The next generation of ''Tropeognathus'' feeds on their corpses.\n\nIn the credits, it is stated that the pterosaurs continued to rule the skies for millions of years while the dinosaurs continued to spread across the globe, even to the most unexpected of environments, such as the South Pole.\n\n{{flatlist|\n;Animals\n: ''[[Tropeognathus]]'' (identified as ''[[Ornithocheirus]]'') {{\u00b7}} ''[[Utahraptor]]'' {{\u00b7}} ''[[Dakotadon]]'' (identified as North American ''Iguanodon'') {{\u00b7}}''[[Gastonia (dinosaur)|Gastonia]] (unnamed) {{\u00b7}} ''[[Iguanodon]]''{{\u00b7}} ''[[Tupandactylus]]'' (identified as ''[[Tapejara (pterosaur)|Tapejara]]'') {{\u00b7}} ''[[Polacanthus]]'' {{\u00b7}} ''[[Iberomesornis]]'' (unnamed, identified as bird){{\u00b7}} ''[[Plesiopleurodon]]'' (unnamed){{\u00b7}} ''[[Saurophthirus]]'' (unnamed, identified as parasites) \n}}\n|LineColor = 9790BB\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber= 5\n| Title=Spirits of the Ice Forest\n| RTitle =<ref name=\"Spirits of the Ice Forest\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p008cmbm|title=Spirits of the Ice Forest - Walking with Dinosaurs, Original series Episode 5 of 6|website=bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n| Aux1= 106 mya\n| DirectedBy= Tim Haines & Jasper James\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1999|11|01|df=y}}\n| Viewers= 15.95\n| ShortSummary= :106 million years ago, Early Cretaceous ([[South Polar region of the Cretaceous|Antarctica]])\n:Filming location: New Zealand\n\nA few hundred kilometres from the [[South Pole]], a clan of ''[[Leaellynasaura]]'' emerge during spring after several months of total darkness. They feed on the fresh plant growth, and build nests to lay their eggs; a male ''[[Koolasuchus]]'' also wakes and heads to a river, where he will stay during the summer. Out on the banks of the river, migrating herds of ''[[Muttaburrasaurus]]'' have also arrived to feed and lay their eggs. When summer arrives, many of the ''Leaellynasaura'' clan's eggs have been eaten; however, those of the matriarch hatch successfully. Meanwhile, a male ''[[Australovenator]]'' (6m) hunts both the ''Leaellynasaura'' and the ''Muttaburrasaurus'', the latter species also having to deal with blood-sucking insects. When autumn arrives, the ''Muttaburrasaurus'' herd begins to migrate, and the ''Koolasuchus'' leaves the river to find a pool for hibernation. During the migration, some ''Muttaburrasaurus'' become lost in the forest; they vocalize loudly while trying to return to their herd, preventing the ''Leaellynasaura'' clan's sentries from hearing the ''Australovenator'' approaching. It manages to kill the matriarch of the clan. Winter descends and the forest is shrouded in darkness, but the now matriarch-less ''Leaellynasaura'' clan is able to stay active, using their large eyes to help them forage for food. The clan and other creatures are also shown to use various methods of coping with the cold such as being frozen alive or suspended animation. Finally, spring returns, and two ''Leaellynasaura'' males challenge each other for the right to mate, and the clan establishes a new dominant pair. The closing narration states that [[continental drift]] will soon pull this landmass closer to the South Pole, and this unique ecosystem will soon disappear.\n\nIn the credits, it is explained that away from the poles, the dinosaurs continued to rule the Earth for another 40 million years before extinction and hints that just before the end of their reign, they had evolved their most infamous predator ever.\n\n{{flatlist|\n;Animals\n: ''[[Leaellynasaura]]''{{\u00b7}} ''[[Koolasuchus]]''{{\u00b7}} ''[[Australovenator]]<ref>{{cite web |title=BBC NaturePREHISTORIC LIFE Australovenator |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302004804/http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/life/Australovenator |website=BBC One}}</ref>'' (identified as \"polar allosaur\"){{\u00b7}} ''[[Muttaburrasaurus]]''{{\u00b7}} ''[[Steropodon]]'' (live-acted by [[coati]]){{\u00b7}} [[Giant weta]] {{\u00b7}} [[Tuatara]] {{\u00b7}} [[Mosquito]] (identified as blood-suckers)\n}}\n|LineColor = 9790BB\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber= 6\n| Title=Death of a Dynasty\n| RTitle =<ref name=\"Death of a Dynasty\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p008cmfz|title=Death of a Dynasty - Walking with Dinosaurs, Original series Episode 6 of 6|website=bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n| Aux1= 65.5 mya\n| DirectedBy= Tim Haines & Jasper James\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1999|11|08|df=y}}\n| Viewers= 15.69\n| ShortSummary= [[File:T. rex head lhs.JPG|thumb|''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' puppet head that was used in ''Walking with Dinosaurs'' at the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]]]]\n:65.5 million years ago, [[Late Cretaceous]] ([[Montana]])\n:Filming location: Chile, New Zealand\n\nSeveral months before the [[Cretaceous&ndash;Paleogene extinction event]], the last dinosaurs are living under intense environmental stress due to excessive [[volcanism]]. A female ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' abandons her nest, the eggs rendered infertile due to poisonous volcanic gases. Her calls for a mate are answered by a smaller male, who kills a young ''[[Triceratops]]'' to appease her. Three days later, after repeated copulation, she drives him off. The mother fasts as she tends to her nest, contending with raids by ''[[Dromaeosaurus]]'' and ''[[Didelphodon]]''. Meanwhile, herds of ''[[Edmontosaurus]]'' wander between islands of vegetation among the volcanic ash, and ''[[Torosaurus]]'' rut for the right to mate, while losing their young to attacking ''Dromaeosaurus''. Only three of the ''Tyrannosaurus'' eggs hatch; the mother hunts an ''Edmontosaurus'' to feed herself and her brood. Several days later, while defending her two surviving offspring, the mother is fatally injured by the tail of an ''[[Ankylosaurus]]''. The juveniles remain expectantly next to the carcass of their mother the next morning; several hours later, they are killed along with the other dinosaurs in the region by the impact of [[Chicxulub impactor|an asteroid]]. The impact, said to be as powerful as ten billion [[Little Boy|Hiroshima bombs]], resulted in 65% of life -the dinosaurs included- dying out in the resulting cataclysmic climate changes.

In a list of the [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]] drawn up by the [[British Film Institute]] in 1999, voted on by industry professionals, ''Walking with Dinosaurs'' was placed 72nd.\n\n[[Common Sense Media]] praised the program, giving it five stars out of five and saying that, \"Somebody had a great idea, which was to make a documentary series about dinosaurs, but with a twist. The ageing ''Tropeognathus'' on a desperate final flight to his mating grounds, the sauropod hatchlings struggling for survival in the late Jurassic, the migrating herds and the undersea life of 150 million years ago would all seem as real as a nature program about [[polar bear]]s or [[snow monkey]]s.\"<ref>{{Cite web\n|url= http://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/walking-dinosaurs\n|title=Walking with Dinosaurs review\n|work=Commonsensemedia.com\n|accessdate=24 March 2011}}</ref> This technique of narrating the prehistoric life as though it were current has been used several times since, for example in the BBC's 2011 ''[[Planet Dinosaur]]'' series.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:95%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\"\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background: LightSteelBlue;\" | List of awards and nominations\n|- style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\"\n!

The production features computer-animated dinosaurs in live-action settings with actors [[Justin Long]], [[John Leguizamo]], [[Tiya Sircar]], and [[Skyler Stone]] providing [[voice-over|voiceover]]s for the main characters. It was directed by [[Neil Nightingale]] and [[Barry Cook]] from a screenplay by [[John Collee]].\n\nThe film was produced by [[BBC Earth]] and Evergreen Films and was named after the original BBC miniseries. The film, with a budget of {{nowrap|US$80 million}}, was one of the largest independent productions to date; it was financed by [[Reliance Entertainment]] and IM Global, with [[20th Century Fox]] handling distribution.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Pomerantz|first1=Dorothy|title='Walking With Dinosaurs' Is A T-Rex Sized Independent Film|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/dorothypomerantz/2013/11/08/walking-with-dinosaurs-is-a-t-rex-sized-independent-film/#6044c9ea532e|accessdate=April 10, 2016|work=Forbes|date=November 8, 2013}}</ref> The crew filmed footage on location in the U.S. state of Alaska and in New Zealand, which were chosen for their similarities to the dinosaurs' surroundings millions of years ago, and on locations in [[Humboldt County, California]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hesseltine|first1=Cassandra|title=Complete Filmography of Humboldt County|url=http://humboldt.filmhumboldtdelnorte.org/filmography|website=Humboldt Del Norte Film Commission|publisher=Humboldt Del Norte Film Commission|accessdate=12 October 2017}}</ref> [[Animal Logic]] designed computer-animated dinosaurs and added them to the live-action backdrop. Though the film was originally going to have a narrator like in the miniseries, Fox executives wanted to add voiceovers to connect audiences to the characters.\n\n''Walking with Dinosaurs'' premiered on {{nowrap|14 December}} 2013 at the [[Dubai International Film Festival]]. It was released in cinemas in 2D and 3D on {{nowrap|20 December}} 2013. Critics commended the film's visual effects but found its storytelling to be sub-par and derided the voiceovers as juvenile. The film grossed {{nowrap|US$34.4 million}} in the United States and Canada and {{nowrap|US$71.6 million}} in other territories for a worldwide total of {{nowrap|US$106 million}}. ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' said the film's global box office performance was disappointing in context of the production budget and marketing spend.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{BBC programme}}\n* ''[http://www.bbcearth.com/walking-with-dinosaurs Walking with Dinosaurs]'' at [[BBC Earth]]\n* {{IMDb title|0214382}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://walkingwithdinosaurs-theorigins.com/|title=Walking With Dinosaurs: The Origins|accessdate=28 May 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423121729/http://walkingwithdinosaurs-theorigins.com/|archivedate=23 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}\n* [http://www.abc.net.au/dinosaurs/ ABC's ''Walking With Dinosaurs'' site]\n* [http://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/prehistoric_life/ BBC Science & Nature \u2013 Prehistoric Life]\n* [http://www.dinosaurlive.com/ Walking with Dinosaurs \u2013 The Arena Spectacular official website]\n\n{{Walking with}}\n{{EmmyAward AnimationLessThanHour 2001\u20132025}}\n{{Impossible Pictures}}\n{{BBC Natural History Unit}}\n{{Portal bar|1990s|BBC|Dinosaurs|Television|United Kingdom}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2012}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Walking With Dinosaurs}}\n[[Category:1999 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1999 British television series endings]]\n[[Category:1990s British documentary television series]]\n[[Category:BBC television documentaries]]\n[[Category:Documentary television series about dinosaurs]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about dinosaurs]]\n[[Category:Discovery Channel original programming]]\n[[Category:Peabody Award-winning television programs]]\n[[Category:Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program winners]]\n[[Category:BAFTA winners (television series)]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:Primetime Emmy Award winners]]\n[[Category:Walking with...]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses}}\n{{Use British English|date=June 2012}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name = Walking With Dinosaurs\n| image = Walkingwithdinosdvdcover.jpg\n| caption = The official DVD cover of ''Walking With Dinosaurs''\n| genre = Nature [[Television documentary|Documentary]]\n| creator = [[Tim Haines]]\n| director = Tim Haines<br />[[Jasper James]]\n| creative_director = Mike Milne\n| narrated = [[Kenneth Branagh]] (BBC broadcast and home video and Discovery Channel)<br />[[Avery Brooks]] (Discovery Channel broadcast)\n| composer = [[Ben Bartlett]]\n| country = United Kingdom\n| language = English\n| num_episodes = 6\n| list_episodes = Walking with Dinosaurs#List of episodes\n| executive_producer = John Lynch<br />\n| producer = Tim Haines<br />Jasper James\n| location = [[Bahamas]], [[California]], [[Chile]], [[New Caledonia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Tasmania]]\n| cinematography = John Howarth<br />Michael Pitts\n| editor = Andrew Wilks\n| runtime = 30 minutes\n| company = [[BBC Natural History Unit]]<br />[[Impossible Pictures]]<br />\n| distributor = [[BBC Worldwide]]\n| first_aired = {{start date|df=yes|1999|10|04}}\n| last_aired = {{end date|df=yes|1999|11|08}}\n| followed_by = ''[[Walking with Beasts]]''\n| related = Other shows in the ''[[Walking with...]]'' series\n| website = http://www.walkingwithdinosaurs.com/\n| production_website = http://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/prehistoric_life/tv_radio/wwdinosaurs/\n| num_series = <!-- 1 miniseries: can omit-->\n| channel = [[BBC One]]\n}}\n\n'''''Walking with Dinosaurs''''' is a six-part [[nature documentary]] television [[miniseries]] created by [[Tim Haines]] and produced by [[BBC Natural History Unit]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Walking with Dinosaurs The Origins|url=http://walkingwithdinosaurs-theorigins.com/|accessdate=28 May 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423121729/http://walkingwithdinosaurs-theorigins.com/|archivedate=23 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The series first aired on the [[BBC]] in the United Kingdom in 1999 with narration by [[Kenneth Branagh]].<ref name=THR>{{cite news|last1=McClintock|first1=Pamela|title=T-Wreck: Why Fox's 'Walking With Dinosaurs' Went Extinct|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/walking-dinosaurs-why-foxs-film-670782|accessdate=April 10, 2016|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=January 15, 2014}}</ref> The series was subsequently aired in North America on the [[Discovery Channel]] in 2000, with [[Avery Brooks]] replacing Branagh.

Filming consisted of wide landscape shots devoid of any live-action creatures and close-up shots with [[animatronics]]. The only creatures in the pilot that are not shown in the series are [[Cetiosaurus]] and [[Scaphognathus]].\n\nSince an extensive amount of [[computer-generated imagery]] would be necessary in creating the numerous full-size dinosaurs that the project demanded, Haines initially approached [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM), the company responsible for creating the visual effects in ''Jurassic Park''. ILM projected a cost of $10,000 per every second of footage featuring a CGI shot, an estimate which BBC deemed too expensive for a television budget. Instead, Haines contracted [[Framestore]], a local British visual effects company to create the CGI elements. Maquettes were built and then scanned, with the resulting 3D models animated in [[Softimage 3D]] and added to the live-action backgrounds. Framestore consulted several palaeontologists in assisting them with developing natural movements and appearances for the dinosaurs.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Huelsman|first1=Eric|title=Walking With Dinosaurs|url=http://www.awn.com/animationworld/walking-dinosaurs|accessdate=April 11, 2016|work=Animation World Network|date=1 March 2000}}</ref> [[Michael Benton]], [[Thomas R. Holtz, Jr.]], [[Peter Dodson]], [[Peter Larson]], David Martill, and James Farlow, served as consultants; their influence in the [[Cinematography|filming process]] was documented in the companion piece, ''The Making of Walking with Dinosaurs''. The CG work was created over the course of two years.\n\n===Scientific accuracy===\n\n==== Behaviour ====\nMichael J. Benton, a consultant to the making of the series and professor of [[Vertebrate paleontology|vertebrate palaeontology]] at the [[University of Bristol]], notes that a group of critics gleefully pointed out that birds and crocodiles, the closest living relatives of the dinosaurs, do not urinate; they shed waste chemicals as more solid [[uric acid]]. In the first episode of ''Walking with Dinosaurs'', a male ''[[Postosuchus]]'' urinates copiously to mark a female's territory as his own after she is driven away from it. However, Benton notes that nobody can prove this was a real mistake: copious urination is the primitive state for tetrapods (seen in fish, amphibians, turtles, and mammals), and perhaps basal [[archosaur]]s did the same. He believes many other claims of \"errors\" identified in the first weeks fizzled out, as the critics had found points about which they disagreed, but they could not prove that their views were correct.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20190307053944/http://palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk/Essays/WWD/default.html \"birds and crocodiles, the closest living relatives of the dinosaurs, do not urinate\".] Benton, M. J. 2001. \"The science of 'Walking with Dinosaurs'\". ''Teaching Earth Sciences'', 24, 371\u2013400.</ref>\n\n==== Anatomy ====\n''[[Ornitholestes]]'', a theropod dinosaur of the [[Late Jurassic]], is shown with a small crest atop its head. However, subsequent studies have concluded that it most likely did not have such a crest, and that the misconception that it did came as a result of broken nasal bones in the holotype.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n==== Size ====\n''[[Tropeognathus]]'' is depicted as far larger than it actually was. In the book based on the series, it was claimed that several large bone fragments from the [[Romualdo Formation]] of Brazil possibly indicate that ''Tropeognathus'' may have had a wingspan reaching almost 12 metres and a weight of a hundred kilograms, making it one of the largest known pterosaurs.<ref>Haines, T., 1999, ''\"Walking with Dinosaurs\": A Natural History'', BBC Books, p. 158</ref> However, these specimens have not been formally described. The largest definite ''Tropeognathus'' specimens known measure 6 metres in wingspan. The specimens which the producers of the programme used to justify such a large size estimate are currently undescribed, and are being studied by Dave Martill and David Unwin. Unwin stated that he does not believe this highest estimate is likely, and that the producers likely chose the highest possible estimate because it was more \"spectacular.\"<ref name=\"dmlbrdeow\">Bredow, H.P. (2000). \"[http://dml.cmnh.org/2000Apr/msg00446.html Re: WWD non-dino questions].\" Message to the Dinosaur Mailing List, 18 April 2000. Retrieved 20 January 2011: http://dml.cmnh.org/2000Apr/msg00446.html</ref> However, no other Early Cretaceous pterosaurs reached its size. Similarly, ''[[Liopleurodon]]'' is depicted as being 25&nbsp;m (82&nbsp;ft) long in the series, whereas the adult size known to have been reached by ''Liopleurodon'' is around 7&nbsp;m (23&nbsp;ft).<ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Adam|title=Liopleurodon|url=http://www.plesiosauria.com/liopleurodon.php|work=The Plesiosaur Directory|accessdate=11 March 2012}}</ref> This was also based on [[Monster of Aramberri|very fragmentary remains]] of which the 20 metre measurement given have been considered dubious, and it is unlikely that these remains belong to ''Liopleurodon''.\n\n==List of episodes==\n[[BBC One]] aired the series weekly on Monday nights, with a regular repeats the following Sunday.

Downstream, a male ''[[Thrinaxodon]]'' resides in a burrow with his family. A female ''[[Postosuchus]]'', a [[Rauisuchidae|rauisuchian]] and one of the largest carnivores alive in the [[Triassic]], attacks the ''Placerias'' herd, and wounds one individual; the herd scatters, leaving the wounded ''Placerias'' to the ''Postosuchus''. Early [[pterosaur]]s called ''[[Peteinosaurus]]'' are depicted feeding on [[Dragonfly|dragonflies]] and cooling themselves in the little water remaining during the drought. Still searching for food, the ''Coelophysis'' discover the ''Thrinaxodon'' burrow; the male wards them off. Later that evening, after he goes off hunting, an inquisitive pup follows the male to the entrance and is eaten by the female ''Coelophysis''. At night, the ''Thrinaxodon'' pair eat their remaining young and then move away. On the next day, the ''Coelophysis'' work to expose the nest. The female ''Postosuchus'' is later shown to have been wounded by the ''Placerias'', a prior attack on them leaving her with a tusk wound on her thigh. After being unable to successfully hunt another ''Placerias'', she is expelled from her territory by a rival male. Wounded, sick, and without a territory, the female dies and is eaten by a pack of ''Coelophysis''. As the dry season continues, food becomes scarce. The ''Placerias'' herd embarks on a journey in search of water, while the ''Coelophysis'' begin to [[cannibalism (zoology)|cannibalise]] their young, and the male ''Thrinaxodon'' also resorts to hunting baby ''Coelophysis'' at night. Finally, the wet season arrives; the majority of the ''Coelophysis'' have survived (including the lead female), and the ''Thrinaxodon'' pair have a new clutch of eggs. The episode ends with the arrival of a migrating herd of ''[[Plateosaurus]]'', foreshadowing the dominance of the [[sauropod]]s after the [[Triassic\u2013Jurassic extinction event]].\n\nIn the credits it is explained that 20 million years later, the aforementioned extinction wiped out many reptile species, but the dinosaurs continued to evolve, with carnivores growing to massive sizes and their prey becoming even larger, setting the stage for the giants of the Jurassic.\n\n{{flatlist|\n;Animals\n: ''[[Coelophysis]]''{{\u00b7}} ''[[Thrinaxodon]]'' (unnamed, identified as cynodont){{\u00b7}} ''[[Placerias]]''{{\u00b7}} ''[[Postosuchus]]''{{\u00b7}} ''[[Peteinosaurus]]''{{\u00b7}} ''[[Plateosaurus]]''{{\u00b7}} [[Lungfish]]{{\u00b7}} [[Dragonfly]]}}\n|LineColor = 9790BB\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber= 2\n| Title=Time of the Titans\n| RTitle =<ref name=\"Time of the Titans\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p008cm33|title=Time of the Titans - Walking with Dinosaurs, Original series Episode 2 of 6|website=}}</ref>\n| Aux1= 152 mya\n| DirectedBy= Tim Haines & Jasper James\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1999|10|11|df=y}}\n| Viewers= 17.75\n| ShortSummary= :152 million years ago, [[Late Jurassic]] ([[Colorado]])\n:Filming location: [[California State Parks]], [[Chile]], [[Tasmania]], New Zealand\n\nThis episode follows the life of a female ''[[Diplodocus]]'', beginning at the moment when her mother lays a clutch of eggs at the edge of a conifer forest. Months later, some of the eggs hatch; the young sauropods are preyed upon by ''[[Ornitholestes]]''. After hatching, the hatchlings retreat to the safety of the denser trees. They face many dangers as they grow, including predation by ''Ornitholestes'' and ''[[Allosaurus]]''. While fending off a pair of ''Allosaurus'', a ''[[Stegosaurus]]'' also accidentally kills one of the hatchlings while swinging its tail. Elsewhere, adult herds of ''Diplodocus'' are shown using their massive weight to topple trees in order to reach [[cycad]] leaves. Each ''Diplodocus'' hosts a small mobile habitat of [[damselfly|damselflies]], ''[[Anurognathus]]'', and [[dung beetle]]s. After some time, the creche of ''Diplodocus'' have grown into subadults. Nearly all are killed by a huge forest fire; only three survivors emerge onto the open plains, including the young female. They encounter several ''[[Brachiosaurus]]'' before two reach safety to a herd of adult ''Diplodocus''. Several years later, the female mates, and is attacked by a bull ''Allosaurus''. She is saved when another ''Diplodocus'' strikes the ''Allosaurus'' with its tail. Although she is wounded, she rejoins the herd. The closing narration notes that the sauropods will only get larger, becoming the largest animals ever to walk the Earth.\n\nIn the credits it is stated that the sauropods eventually went into decline with their prairies becoming flooded by rising sea levels, resulting in vast inland seas and the giant marine reptiles that patrolled them.\n\n{{flatlist|\n;Animals\n: ''[[Diplodocus]]''{{\u00b7}} ''[[Allosaurus]]''{{\u00b7}} ''[[Ornitholestes]]''{{\u00b7}} ''[[Stegosaurus]]''{{\u00b7}} ''[[Brachiosaurus]]''{{\u00b7}} ''[[Anurognathus]]''{{\u00b7}} ''[[Dryosaurus]]'' (unnamed){{\u00b7}} ''[[Othnielia]]'' (unnamed){{\u00b7}} [[Damselfly]] {{\u00b7}} [[Dung beetle]]}}\n|LineColor = 9790BB\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber= 3\n| Title=Cruel Sea\n| RTitle =<ref name=\"Cruel Sea\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p008cm6f|title=Cruel Sea - Walking with Dinosaurs, Original series Episode 3 of 6|website=bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n| Aux1= 149 mya\n| DirectedBy= Tim Haines & Jasper James\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1999|10|18|df=y}}\n| Viewers= 17.96\n| ShortSummary= [[File:Eustreptospondylus head.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Eustreptospondylus]]'' puppet head that was used in ''Walking with Dinosaurs'' at the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]]]]\n:149 million years ago, Late Jurassic ([[Oxfordshire]])\n:Filming location: The Bahamas, [[New Caledonia]]\n\nThe episode begins with a ''[[Eustreptospondylus]]'' being snatched from the shore by ''[[Liopleurodon]]''. Meanwhile, hundreds of ''[[Ophthalmosaurus]]'' arrive from the open ocean to give birth. ''[[Hybodus]]'' and a ''Liopleurodon'' are on the hunt; when a mother ''Ophthalmosaurus'' has trouble giving birth, a pair of ''Hybodus'' pursue her. They are frightened off by a male ''Liopleurodon'', which eats the front half of the [[ichthyosaur]]. Meanwhile, a ''Eustreptospondylus'' swims to an island and discovers a turtle carcass; it fights over the carcass with another ''Eustreptospondylus''. Later, during the night, a group of [[horseshoe crab]]s gather at the shore to lay their eggs, which attracts a flock of ''[[Rhamphorhynchus]]'' in the morning to eat the eggs. However, a few of the pterosaurs are caught and eaten by a ''Eustreptospondylus''. While the ''Ophthalmosaurus'' juveniles are growing up, they are hunted by ''Hybodus'', which in turn, are prey for the ''Liopleurodon''. While the male ''Liopleurodon'' is hunting, he encounters a female ''Liopleurodon''; after the male bites one of her flippers, she retreats from his territory, and a group of ''Hybodus'' follows the trail of her blood. A [[cyclone]] strikes the islands, killing many animals, including several ''Rhamphorhynchus'' and the ''Liopleurodon'', who is washed ashore and eventually suffocates under his own weight. A group of ''Eustreptospondylus'' feed on his carcass. At the end of the episode, the juvenile ''Ophthalmosaurus'' that survived the storm are now large enough to swim off and live in the open sea.\n\nIn the credits, it is stated that even though only turtles remain, marine reptiles were a glory of their age and that another group shared the dinosaur's world, the flying pterosaurs, which are claimed to be just as spectacular.\n\n{{flatlist|\n;Animals\n: ''[[Ophthalmosaurus]]''{{\u00b7}} ''[[Liopleurodon]]''{{\u00b7}} ''[[Eustreptospondylus]]''{{\u00b7}} ''[[Cryptoclidus]]''{{\u00b7}} ''[[Rhamphorhynchus]]''{{\u00b7}} ''[[Hybodus]]'' (unnamed, identified as shark){{\u00b7}} ''[[Perisphinctes]]'' (unnamed, identified as ammonite) {{\u00b7}} ''[[Leptolepis]]'' (unnamed) {{\u00b7}} Jellyfish {{\u00b7}} Bark beetle {{\u00b7}}[[Horseshoe crab]] {{\u00b7}} [[Squid]] \n}}\n|LineColor = 9790BB\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber= 4\n| Title=Giant of the Skies\n| RTitle =<ref name=\"Giant of the Skies\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p008cmk8|title=Giant of the Skies - Walking with Dinosaurs, Original series Episode 4 of 6|website=bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n| Aux1= 127 mya\n| DirectedBy= Tim Haines & Jasper James\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1999|10|25|df=y}}\n| Viewers= 16.8\n| ShortSummary= [[File:Pterosaur exhibit.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Tropeognathus]]'' puppet head that was used in ''Walking with Dinosaurs'' at the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]]]]\n:127 million years ago, [[Early Cretaceous]] ([[Brazil]], [[North America]], [[Europe]] and [[Cantabria]])\n:Filming location: New Zealand, [[Tasmania]]\n\nThe episode begins with a male ''[[Tropeognathus]]'' dead on a beach. Six months earlier, the ''Tropeognathus'', resting among a colony of breeding ''[[Tupandactylus]]'' in [[Brazil]], flies off for Cantabria where it too must mate. He flies past a [[animal migration|migrating]] group of the iguanodont ''[[Dakotadon]]'' and the nodosaur ''[[Polacanthus]]''. He reaches the southern tip of North America, where he is forced to shelter from a storm. He grooms himself, expelling his body of ''[[Saurophthirus]]'' fleas; the crest on his jaw begins to change colour in preparation for the mating season. He then sets off across the [[Atlantic]], which was then only 300 kilometres wide, and after a whole day on the wing, reaches the westernmost of the European islands. He does not rest there however, as a pack of ''[[Utahraptor]]'' are hunting ''[[Iguanodon]]''; a young ''Utahraptor'' is bullied off an ''Iguanodon'' carcass by the adults. The ''Tropeognathus'' flies to the outskirts of a forest to rest after stealing a fish from another pterosaur, but is driven away by ''[[Iberomesornis]]''. Flying on, he reaches Cantabria, but due to the delays, exhaustion, and old age he cannot reach the centre of the many grounded male ''Tropeognathus'' and consequently he does not mate. After several days under the sun trying to attract a mate, the protagonist ''Tropeognathus'' -alongside others who lost out- dies from heat exhaustion and starvation. The next generation of ''Tropeognathus'' feeds on their corpses.\n\nIn the credits, it is stated that the pterosaurs continued to rule the skies for millions of years while the dinosaurs continued to spread across the globe, even to the most unexpected of environments, such as the South Pole.\n\n{{flatlist|\n;Animals\n: ''[[Tropeognathus]]'' (identified as ''[[Ornithocheirus]]'') {{\u00b7}} ''[[Utahraptor]]'' {{\u00b7}} ''[[Dakotadon]]'' (identified as North American ''Iguanodon'') {{\u00b7}} ''[[Iguanodon]]''{{\u00b7}} ''[[Tupandactylus]]'' (identified as ''[[Tapejara (pterosaur)|Tapejara]]'') {{\u00b7}} ''[[Polacanthus]]'' {{\u00b7}} ''[[Iberomesornis]]'' (unnamed, identified as bird){{\u00b7}} ''[[Plesiopleurodon]]'' (unnamed){{\u00b7}} ''[[Saurophthirus]]'' (unnamed, identified as parasites) \n}}\n|LineColor = 9790BB\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber= 5\n| Title=Spirits of the Ice Forest\n| RTitle =<ref name=\"Spirits of the Ice Forest\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p008cmbm|title=Spirits of the Ice Forest - Walking with Dinosaurs, Original series Episode 5 of 6|website=bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n| Aux1= 106 mya\n| DirectedBy= Tim Haines & Jasper James\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1999|11|01|df=y}}\n| Viewers= 15.95\n| ShortSummary= :106 million years ago, Early Cretaceous ([[South Polar region of the Cretaceous|Antarctica]])\n:Filming location: New Zealand\n\nA few hundred kilometres from the [[South Pole]], a clan of ''[[Leaellynasaura]]'' emerge during spring after several months of total darkness. They feed on the fresh plant growth, and build nests to lay their eggs; a male ''[[Koolasuchus]]'' also wakes and heads to a river, where he will stay during the summer. Out on the banks of the river, migrating herds of ''[[Muttaburrasaurus]]'' have also arrived to feed and lay their eggs. When summer arrives, many of the ''Leaellynasaura'' clan's eggs have been eaten; however, those of the matriarch hatch successfully. Meanwhile, a male ''[[Australovenator]]'' (6m) hunts both the ''Leaellynasaura'' and the ''Muttaburrasaurus'', the latter species also having to deal with blood-sucking insects. When autumn arrives, the ''Muttaburrasaurus'' herd begins to migrate, and the ''Koolasuchus'' leaves the river to find a pool for hibernation. During the migration, some ''Muttaburrasaurus'' become lost in the forest; they vocalize loudly while trying to return to their herd, preventing the ''Leaellynasaura'' clan's sentries from hearing the ''Australovenator'' approaching. It manages to kill the matriarch of the clan. Winter descends and the forest is shrouded in darkness, but the now matriarch-less ''Leaellynasaura'' clan is able to stay active, using their large eyes to help them forage for food. The clan and other creatures are also shown to use various methods of coping with the cold such as being frozen alive or suspended animation. Finally, spring returns, and two ''Leaellynasaura'' males challenge each other for the right to mate, and the clan establishes a new dominant pair. The closing narration states that [[continental drift]] will soon pull this landmass closer to the South Pole, and this unique ecosystem will soon disappear.\n\nIn the credits, it is explained that away from the poles, the dinosaurs continued to rule the Earth for another 40 million years before extinction and hints that just before the end of their reign, they had evolved their most infamous predator ever.\n\n{{flatlist|\n;Animals\n: ''[[Leaellynasaura]]''{{\u00b7}} ''[[Koolasuchus]]''{{\u00b7}} ''[[Australovenator]]<ref>{{cite web |title=BBC NaturePREHISTORIC LIFE Australovenator |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302004804/http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/life/Australovenator |website=BBC One}}</ref>'' (identified as \"polar allosaur\"){{\u00b7}} ''[[Muttaburrasaurus]]''{{\u00b7}} ''[[Steropodon]]'' (live-acted by [[coati]]){{\u00b7}} [[Giant weta]] {{\u00b7}} [[Tuatara]] {{\u00b7}} [[Mosquito]] (identified as blood-suckers)\n}}\n|LineColor = 9790BB\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber= 6\n| Title=Death of a Dynasty\n| RTitle =<ref name=\"Death of a Dynasty\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p008cmfz|title=Death of a Dynasty - Walking with Dinosaurs, Original series Episode 6 of 6|website=bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n| Aux1= 65.5 mya\n| DirectedBy= Tim Haines & Jasper James\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1999|11|08|df=y}}\n| Viewers= 15.69\n| ShortSummary= [[File:T. rex head lhs.JPG|thumb|''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' puppet head that was used in ''Walking with Dinosaurs'' at the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]]]]\n:65.5 million years ago, [[Late Cretaceous]] ([[Montana]])\n:Filming location: Chile, New Zealand\n\nSeveral months before the [[Cretaceous&ndash;Paleogene extinction event]], the last dinosaurs are living under intense environmental stress due to excessive [[volcanism]]. A female ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' abandons her nest, the eggs rendered infertile due to poisonous volcanic gases. Her calls for a mate are answered by a smaller male, who kills a young ''[[Triceratops]]'' to appease her. Three days later, after repeated copulation, she drives him off. The mother fasts as she tends to her nest, contending with raids by ''[[Dromaeosaurus]]'' and ''[[Didelphodon]]''. Meanwhile, herds of ''[[Edmontosaurus]]'' wander between islands of vegetation among the volcanic ash, and ''[[Torosaurus]]'' rut for the right to mate, while losing their young to attacking ''Dromaeosaurus''. Only three of the ''Tyrannosaurus'' eggs hatch; the mother hunts an ''Edmontosaurus'' to feed herself and her brood. Several days later, while defending her two surviving offspring, the mother is fatally injured by the tail of an ''[[Ankylosaurus]]''. The juveniles remain expectantly next to the carcass of their mother the next morning; several hours later, they are killed along with the other dinosaurs in the region by the impact of [[Chicxulub impactor|an asteroid]]. The impact, said to be as powerful as ten billion [[Little Boy|Hiroshima bombs]], resulted in 65% of life -the dinosaurs included- dying out in the resulting cataclysmic climate changes. In an epilogue, the present-day African plains are shown; while they are now dominated by [[mammal]]s after the extinction, they are still populated by numerous surviving dinosaurs: the [[bird]]s.\n\n{{flatlist|\n;Animals\n: ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''{{\u00b7}} ''[[Edmontosaurus annectens|Edmontosaurus]]'' (identified as ''Anatotitan''){{\u00b7}} ''[[Torosaurus]]''{{\u00b7}} ''[[Ankylosaurus]]'' {{\u00b7}} ''[[Dromaeosaurus]]'' (identified as a dromaeosaur){{\u00b7}} ''[[Quetzalcoatlus]]''{{\u00b7}} ''[[Deinosuchus]]'' (unnamed, identified as crocodile){{\u00b7}} ''[[Didelphodon]]'' {{\u00b7}} ''[[Dinilysia]]'' (live-acted by a [[red-tailed boa]], identified as snake) {{\u00b7}} ''[[Thescelosaurus]]''  (unnamed) {{\u2022}} ''[[Triceratops]]'' (carcass) {{\u2022}} ''[[Purgatorius]]'' (carcass)\n}}\n|LineColor = 9790BB\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber= -\n| Title=The Making Of Walking with Dinosaurs\n| RTitle =<ref name=\"The Making of Walking With Dinosaurs\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p008cmnm|title=The Making of Walking With Dinosaurs - BBC One|website=bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n| Aux1= N/A\n| DirectedBy=Jasper James\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1999|10|06|df=y}}\n| Viewers= 7.19\n| ShortSummary=50-minute special documenting the series' paleontological influence, animatronic effects, CGI and the real location shooting for the series background.\n}}\n}}\n\n==Music==\n[[Ben Bartlett]] composed the score for ''Walking with Dinosaurs''. Bartlett was encouraged to accept the duties of composing the series' music at the behest of Haines and James. Bartlett wrote different [[leitmotif]]s in separate styles for each episode, citing the different themes and settings presented in each episode as inspiration, elaborating, \"I tried to create a different sound world for each episode of ''Walking With Dinosaurs''. That was easy, as they all had different moods. The first episode is all about heat and bloodlust, parched deserts and so on, while the second one was pastoral, peaceful, and beautiful, about dinosaurs living in symbiosis with the forests.

The score was recorded by the [[BBC Concert Orchestra]]. During these sessions, Bartlett admitted to being enriched with experience by the task, stating, \"It was the biggest orchestral endeavour I've ever undertaken, and I learnt so much from the first session.

It was released in cinemas in 2D and 3D on {{nowrap|20 December}} 2013. Critics commended the film's visual effects but found its storytelling to be sub-par and derided the voiceovers as juvenile. The film grossed {{nowrap|US$34.4 million}} in the United States and Canada and {{nowrap|US$71.6 million}} in other territories for a worldwide total of {{nowrap|US$106 million}}.

In most cases, the sire is a zebra [[stallion]]. Offspring of a donkey sire and zebra dam called a '''donkra''' or '''zebra hinny''' and offspring of a horse sire and a zebra dam called a '''hebra''' do exist, but are rare and are usually sterile and infertile. Zebroids have been bred since the 19th century. [[Charles Darwin]] noted several zebra hybrids in his works.\n\n==Types==\nZebroid is the term generally used for all zebra hybrids. The different hybrids are generally named using a [[portmanteau]] of the [[wikt:sire#Noun|sire]]'s name and the [[wikt:dam#Noun 2|dam]]'s name. Generally, no distinction is made as to which zebra species is used. Many times, when zebras are crossbred, they develop some form of [[dwarfism]]. Breeding of different branches of the equine family, which does not occur in the wild, generally results in infertile offspring. The combination of sire and dam also affects the offspring [[phenotype]].\n\nA zorse is the offspring of a [[zebra]] stallion and a horse [[mare]]. This cross is also called a zebrula, zebrule, or zebra mule. The rarer reverse pairing is sometimes called a hebra, horbra, zebrinny, zebret, or zebra hinny. Like most other animal hybrids, the zorse is sterile.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.equinepost.com/resources/breeds/showBreed.asp?ID=150|title= Zorse Breed Description |work= Breeding References|publisher= EquinePost |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710195153/http://www.equinepost.com/resources/breeds/showBreed.asp?ID=150 |archivedate=2011-07-10}}</ref>\n\nA zony is the offspring of a zebra stallion and a pony mare.

Like [[mule]]s and [[hinny]]s, however, they are generally genetically unable to breed, due to an odd number of chromosomes disrupting [[meiosis]].\n\n==Genetics==\nLiving equids show wide variation in the number of [[chromosome]]s, ranging from a diploid number of 32 chromosomes in the [[mountain zebra]] to 66 in [[Przewalski's horse]]. This is due to number of chromosomal fusion and fission events during the evolution of equids.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Musilova|first=P.|last2=Kubickova|first2=S.|last3=Vahala|first3=J.|last4=Rubes|first4=J.|date=2013-03-27|title=Subchromosomal karyotype evolution in Equidae|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10577-013-9346-z|journal=Chromosome Research|volume=21|issue=2|pages=175\u2013187|doi=10.1007/s10577-013-9346-z|issn=0967-3849}}</ref> The zebra has between 32 and 46 chromosomes depending on the species.\n\nIn spite of this difference, viable hybrids are possible, provided the gene combination in the hybrid allows for embryonic development to birth. A hybrid has a number of chromosomes somewhere in between. The chromosome difference makes female hybrids poorly fertile and male hybrids generally sterile, due to a phenomenon called [[Haldane's rule]]. The difference in chromosome number is most likely due to horses having two longer chromosomes that contain similar gene content to four zebra chromosomes.<ref>{{Cite journal | title = Chromosome Studies of a Donkey-Grevy Zebra Hybrid | journal = Chromosoma | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | year = 1964 | author = K.

And just as female mules and hinnies only very rarely produce offspring the same appears to be true of zebroids. Considering zebroids are much less common as mules the chances of a fertile zebroid mare are very slim. Only ONE case of such a mare was reported : The zebroid mare of a zebra mare x draft horse stallion produced a foal when she was bred back to her sire but the foal died of lightning and she did not survive it much longer.\n\n=== Extant ''Equus'' species: chromosome number ===\n{{See also|Equus (genus)#Taxonomic_and_evolutionary_history}}\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible\"\n!Subgenus\n!Scientific name\n!Common name\n!Chromosome number (2n)\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |''Hippotigris''\n\n(Zebras)\n|''Equus zebra''\n|[[Mountain zebra]]\n|32\n|-\n|''Equus grevyi''\n|[[Gr\u00e9vy's zebra]]\n|46\n|-\n|''Equus quagga''\n|[[Plains zebra]]\n|44\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |'''''Asinus'''''\n\n'''(wild asses)'''\n|''Equus africanus''\n|[[African wild ass]]; includes domesticated [[donkey]]\n|62\n|-\n|''Equus hemionus''\n|[[Onager]], hemione, or Asiatic wild ass\n|56\n|-\n|''Equus kiang''\n|[[Kiang]]\n|52 <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=J\u00f3nsson|first=H\u00e1kon|last2=Schubert|first2=Mikkel|last3=Seguin-Orlando|first3=Andaine|last4=Ginolhac|first4=Aur\u00e9lien|last5=Petersen|first5=Lillian|last6=Fumagalli|first6=Matteo|last7=Albrechtsen|first7=Anders|last8=Petersen|first8=Bent|last9=Korneliussen|first9=Thorfinn S.|last10=Vilstrup|first10=Julia T.|last11=Lear|first11=Teri|date=2014-12-30|title=Speciation with gene flow in equids despite extensive chromosomal plasticity|url=http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.1412627111|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=111|issue=52|pages=18655\u201318660|doi=10.1073/pnas.1412627111|issn=0027-8424|pmc=4284605|pmid=25453089}}</ref>\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |''Equus''\n|''Equus ferus caballus''\n|Domesticated [[horse]]\n|64\n|-\n|''Equus ferus przewalskii''\n|[[Przewalski's horse]]\n|66 <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lau|first=Allison N.|last2=Peng|first2=Lei|last3=Goto|first3=Hiroki|last4=Chemnick|first4=Leona|last5=Ryder|first5=Oliver A.|last6=Makova|first6=Kateryna D.|date=2009-01-01|title=Horse Domestication and Conservation Genetics of Przewalski's Horse Inferred from Sex Chromosomal and Autosomal Sequences|url=https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/26/1/199/973911|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution|language=en|volume=26|issue=1|pages=199\u2013208|doi=10.1093/molbev/msn239|issn=0737-4038}}</ref>\n|}\nZebras are more closely related to wild asses (a group which includes donkeys) than to horses.

The stripes generally do not cover the whole body, and might be confined to the legs or spread onto parts of the body or neck. If the nonzebra parent was patterned (such as a [[Roan (horse)|roan]], [[Appaloosa]], [[Pinto horse|pinto]]/[[American Paint Horse|paint]], [[piebald]], or [[skewbald]]), this pattern might be passed down to the zebroid, in which case the stripes are usually confined to non-white areas. The alternative name \"golden zebra\" relates to the interaction of zebra striping and a horse's bay or chestnut colour to give a zebra-like black-on-bay or black-on-chestnut pattern that superficially resembles the extinct [[quagga]]. Zebra-donkey hybrids usually have a dorsal (back) stripe and a ventral (belly) stripe.\n\n[[File:Zorse.jpg|thumb|The hebra Eclyse]]\nZorses combine the zebra striping overlaid on colored areas of the hybrid's coat. Zorses are most often bred using solid-color horses. If the horse parent is piebald (black and white) or skewbald (other color and white), the zorse may inherit the dominant depigmentation genes for white patches. The [[tobiano]] (the most common white modifier found in the horse) directly interacts with the zorse coat to give the white markings. Only the nondepigmented areas will have zebra striping, resulting in a zorse with white patches and striped patches. This effect is seen in the zebroid named Eclyse (a hebra rather than a zorse) born in Stukenbrock, Germany, in 2007 to a zebra mare called Eclipse and a stallion called Ulysses.\n\nZebroids are preferred over zebras for practical uses, such as riding, because the zebra has a different body shape from a [[horse]] or [[donkey]], and consequently it is difficult to find [[Horse tack|tack]] to fit a zebra. However, a zebroid is usually more inclined to be temperamental than a [[purebred]] horse and can be difficult to handle. Zebras, being wild animals, and not domesticated like horses and donkeys, pass on their wild animal traits to their offspring.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Zebras, while not usually very large, are extremely strong and aggressive. Similarly, zorses have a strong temperament and can be aggressive.\n\n==Historical and notable zebroids==\n[[Image:zebroidfoal.jpg|thumbnail|Zebra-horse hybrid foal with quagga-like markings, [[Walter Rothschild Zoological Museum]], [[Tring]], [[England]]]]\n\nIn 1815, Lord Morton mated a quagga stallion to a chestnut [[Arabian horse|Arabian]] mare. The result was a female hybrid which resembled both parents. This provoked the interest of Cossar Ewart, Professor of Natural History at Edinburgh (1882\u20131927) and a keen geneticist. Ewart crossed a zebra stallion with pony mares to investigate the theory of [[telegony (pregnancy)|telegony]], or paternal impression. In ''[[Origin of Species]]'' (1859), [[Charles Darwin]] mentioned four coloured drawings of hybrids between the ass and zebra. He also wrote\n<blockquote>\nIn Lord Morton's famous hybrid from a chestnut mare and male quagga, the hybrid, and even the pure offspring subsequently produced from the mare by a black Arabian sire, were much more plainly barred across the legs than is even the pure quagga.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Darwin|first1=Charles|title=On the origin of species, 1859.|date=2009|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0814720585|pages=118\u2013119}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\nIn his book ''[[The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication]]'', Darwin described a hybrid ass-zebra specimen in the British Museum as being dappled on its flanks. He also mentioned a \"triple hybrid, from a bay mare, by a hybrid from a male ass and female zebra\" displayed at [[London Zoo]]. This would have required the zebroid sire to be fertile.\n\nDuring the South African War, the [[Boer]]s crossed Chapman's zebras with ponies, to produce animals for transport work, chiefly for hauling guns. A specimen was captured by British forces and presented to [[King Edward VII]] by [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], and was photographed by W. S. Berridge.<ref>''Wonders of Animal Life'', edited by [[John Alexander Hammerton|J. A. Hammerton]] (1930)</ref> Zebras are resistant to sleeping sickness, whereas purebred horses and ponies are not, and  zebra mules hopefully would inherit this resistance.\n\nGrevy's zebra has been crossed with the [[Somali wild ass]] in the early 20th century. [[Zorse]]s were bred by the US government and reported in ''Genetics in Relation to Agriculture'' by E. B. Babcock and R. E. Clausen (early 20th century), in an attempt to investigate inheritance and telegony. The experiments were also reported in ''The Science of Life'' by H G Wells, J Huxley, and G P Wells (around 1929).\n\nInterest in zebra crosses continued in the 1970s. In 1973, a cross between a zebra and a donkey was foaled at the Jerusalem Zoo. They called it a \"hamzab\". In the 1970s, the [[Colchester Zoo]] in England bred zedonks, at first by accident and later to create a disease-resistant riding and draft animal. The experiment was discontinued when zoos became more conservation-minded. A number of hybrids were kept at the zoo after this; the last died in 2009.<ref>{{cite press release| title = Colchester Zoo mourns the loss of Shadow the Zeedonk| url = http://www.colchester-zoo.com/index.cfm?fa=news.press.detail&Press_Release_ID=244| date = 3 April 2009| publisher = Colchester Zoo| url-status = live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110708174954/http://www.colchester-zoo.com/index.cfm?fa=news.press.detail&Press_Release_ID=244| archivedate = 8 July 2011| df = dmy-all}}</ref> One adult still remains at the tourist attraction of [[Groombridge Place]]<ref>{{cite web |title=The Enchanted Forest |url=http://www.groombridge.co.uk/enchanted.htm |work=Groombridge Place Gardens |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729084438/http://www.groombridge.co.uk/enchanted.htm |archivedate=29 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> near Tunbridge Wells in Kent.\n\n===21st century===\nToday, various zebroids are bred as riding and draft animals, and as curiosities in circuses and smaller zoos.

In most cases, the sire is a zebra [[stallion]]. Offspring of a donkey sire and zebra dam called a '''donkra''' or '''zebra hinny''' and offspring of a horse sire and a zebra dam called a '''hebra''' do exist, but are rare and are usually sterile and infertile. Zebroids have been bred since the 19th century. [[Charles Darwin]] noted several zebra hybrids in his works.\n\n==Types==\nZebroid is the term generally used for all zebra hybrids. The different hybrids are generally named using a [[portmanteau]] of the [[wikt:sire#Noun|sire]]'s name and the [[wikt:dam#Noun 2|dam]]'s name. Generally, no distinction is made as to which zebra species is used. Many times, when zebras are crossbred, they develop some form of [[dwarfism]]. Breeding of different branches of the equine family, which does not occur in the wild, generally results in infertile offspring. The combination of sire and dam also affects the offspring [[phenotype]].\n\nA zorse is the offspring of a [[zebra]] stallion and a horse [[mare]]. This cross is also called a zebrula, zebrule, or zebra mule. The rarer reverse pairing is sometimes called a hebra, horbra, zebrinny, zebret, or zebra hinny. Like most other animal hybrids, the zorse is sterile.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.equinepost.com/resources/breeds/showBreed.asp?ID=150|title= Zorse Breed Description |work= Breeding References|publisher= EquinePost |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710195153/http://www.equinepost.com/resources/breeds/showBreed.asp?ID=150 |archivedate=2011-07-10}}</ref>\n\nA zony is the offspring of a zebra stallion and a pony mare.

Only ONE case of such a mare was reported : The zebroid mare of a zebra mare x draft horse stallion produced a foal when she was bred back to her sire but the foal died of lightning and she did not survive it much longer.\n\n=== Extant ''Equus'' species: chromosome number ===\n{{See also|Equus (genus)#Taxonomic_and_evolutionary_history}}\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible\"\n!Subgenus\n!Scientific name\n!Common name\n!Chromosome number (2n)\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |''Hippotigris''\n\n(Zebras)\n|''Equus zebra''\n|[[Mountain zebra]]\n|32\n|-\n|''Equus grevyi''\n|[[Gr\u00e9vy's zebra]]\n|46\n|-\n|''Equus quagga''\n|[[Plains zebra]]\n|44\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |'''''Asinus''''' \n\n'''(wild asses)'''\n|''Equus africanus''\n|[[African wild ass]]; includes domesticated [[donkey]]\n|62\n|-\n|''Equus hemionus''\n|[[Onager]], hemione, or Asiatic wild ass\n|56\n|-\n|''Equus kiang''\n|[[Kiang]]\n|52 <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=J\u00f3nsson|first=H\u00e1kon|last2=Schubert|first2=Mikkel|last3=Seguin-Orlando|first3=Andaine|last4=Ginolhac|first4=Aur\u00e9lien|last5=Petersen|first5=Lillian|last6=Fumagalli|first6=Matteo|last7=Albrechtsen|first7=Anders|last8=Petersen|first8=Bent|last9=Korneliussen|first9=Thorfinn S.|last10=Vilstrup|first10=Julia T.|last11=Lear|first11=Teri|date=2014-12-30|title=Speciation with gene flow in equids despite extensive chromosomal plasticity|url=http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.1412627111|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=111|issue=52|pages=18655\u201318660|doi=10.1073/pnas.1412627111|issn=0027-8424|pmc=4284605|pmid=25453089}}</ref>\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |''Equus''\n|''Equus ferus caballus''\n|Domesticated [[horse]]\n|64\n|-\n|''Equus ferus przewalskii''\n|[[Przewalski's horse]]\n|66 <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lau|first=Allison N.|last2=Peng|first2=Lei|last3=Goto|first3=Hiroki|last4=Chemnick|first4=Leona|last5=Ryder|first5=Oliver A.|last6=Makova|first6=Kateryna D.|date=2009-01-01|title=Horse Domestication and Conservation Genetics of Przewalski's Horse Inferred from Sex Chromosomal and Autosomal Sequences|url=https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/26/1/199/973911|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution|language=en|volume=26|issue=1|pages=199\u2013208|doi=10.1093/molbev/msn239|issn=0737-4038}}</ref>\n|}\nZebras are more closely related to wild asses (a group which includes donkeys) than to horses.

The stripes generally do not cover the whole body, and might be confined to the legs or spread onto parts of the body or neck. If the nonzebra parent was patterned (such as a [[Roan (horse)|roan]], [[Appaloosa]], [[Pinto horse|pinto]]/[[American Paint Horse|paint]], [[piebald]], or [[skewbald]]), this pattern might be passed down to the zebroid, in which case the stripes are usually confined to non-white areas. The alternative name \"golden zebra\" relates to the interaction of zebra striping and a horse's bay or chestnut colour to give a zebra-like black-on-bay or black-on-chestnut pattern that superficially resembles the extinct [[quagga]]. Zebra-donkey hybrids usually have a dorsal (back) stripe and a ventral (belly) stripe.\n\n[[File:Zorse.jpg|thumb|The hebra Eclyse]]\nZorses combine the zebra striping overlaid on colored areas of the hybrid's coat. Zorses are most often bred using solid-color horses. If the horse parent is piebald (black and white) or skewbald (other color and white), the zorse may inherit the dominant depigmentation genes for white patches. The [[tobiano]] (the most common white modifier found in the horse) directly interacts with the zorse coat to give the white markings. Only the nondepigmented areas will have zebra striping, resulting in a zorse with white patches and striped patches. This effect is seen in the zebroid named Eclyse (a hebra rather than a zorse) born in Stukenbrock, Germany, in 2007 to a zebra mare called Eclipse and a stallion called Ulysses.\n\nZebroids are preferred over zebras for practical uses, such as riding, because the zebra has a different body shape from a [[horse]] or [[donkey]], and consequently it is difficult to find [[Horse tack|tack]] to fit a zebra. However, a zebroid is usually more inclined to be temperamental than a [[purebred]] horse and can be difficult to handle. Zebras, being wild animals, and not domesticated like horses and donkeys, pass on their wild animal traits to their offspring.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Zebras, while not usually very large, are extremely strong and aggressive. Similarly, zorses have a strong temperament and can be aggressive.\n\n==Historical and notable zebroids==\n[[Image:zebroidfoal.jpg|thumbnail|Zebra-horse hybrid foal with quagga-like markings, [[Walter Rothschild Zoological Museum]], [[Tring]], [[England]]]]\n\nIn 1815, Lord Morton mated a quagga stallion to a chestnut [[Arabian horse|Arabian]] mare. The result was a female hybrid which resembled both parents. This provoked the interest of Cossar Ewart, Professor of Natural History at Edinburgh (1882\u20131927) and a keen geneticist. Ewart crossed a zebra stallion with pony mares to investigate the theory of [[telegony (pregnancy)|telegony]], or paternal impression. In ''[[Origin of Species]]'' (1859), [[Charles Darwin]] mentioned four coloured drawings of hybrids between the ass and zebra. He also wrote\n<blockquote>\nIn Lord Morton's famous hybrid from a chestnut mare and male quagga, the hybrid, and even the pure offspring subsequently produced from the mare by a black Arabian sire, were much more plainly barred across the legs than is even the pure quagga.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Darwin|first1=Charles|title=On the origin of species, 1859.|date=2009|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0814720585|pages=118\u2013119}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\nIn his book ''[[The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication]]'', Darwin described a hybrid ass-zebra specimen in the British Museum as being dappled on its flanks. He also mentioned a \"triple hybrid, from a bay mare, by a hybrid from a male ass and female zebra\" displayed at [[London Zoo]]. This would have required the zebroid sire to be fertile.\n\nDuring the South African War, the [[Boer]]s crossed Chapman's zebras with ponies, to produce animals for transport work, chiefly for hauling guns. A specimen was captured by British forces and presented to [[King Edward VII]] by [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], and was photographed by W. S. Berridge.<ref>''Wonders of Animal Life'', edited by [[John Alexander Hammerton|J. A. Hammerton]] (1930)</ref> Zebras are resistant to sleeping sickness, whereas purebred horses and ponies are not, and  zebra mules hopefully would inherit this resistance.\n\nGrevy's zebra has been crossed with the [[Somali wild ass]] in the early 20th century. [[Zorse]]s were bred by the US government and reported in ''Genetics in Relation to Agriculture'' by E. B. Babcock and R. E. Clausen (early 20th century), in an attempt to investigate inheritance and telegony. The experiments were also reported in ''The Science of Life'' by H G Wells, J Huxley, and G P Wells (around 1929).\n\nInterest in zebra crosses continued in the 1970s. In 1973, a cross between a zebra and a donkey was foaled at the Jerusalem Zoo. They called it a \"hamzab\". In the 1970s, the [[Colchester Zoo]] in England bred zedonks, at first by accident and later to create a disease-resistant riding and draft animal. The experiment was discontinued when zoos became more conservation-minded. A number of hybrids were kept at the zoo after this; the last died in 2009.<ref>{{cite press release| title = Colchester Zoo mourns the loss of Shadow the Zeedonk| url = http://www.colchester-zoo.com/index.cfm?fa=news.press.detail&Press_Release_ID=244| date = 3 April 2009| publisher = Colchester Zoo| url-status = live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110708174954/http://www.colchester-zoo.com/index.cfm?fa=news.press.detail&Press_Release_ID=244| archivedate = 8 July 2011| df = dmy-all}}</ref> One adult still remains at the tourist attraction of [[Groombridge Place]]<ref>{{cite web |title=The Enchanted Forest |url=http://www.groombridge.co.uk/enchanted.htm |work=Groombridge Place Gardens |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729084438/http://www.groombridge.co.uk/enchanted.htm |archivedate=29 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> near Tunbridge Wells in Kent.\n\n===21st century===\nToday, various zebroids are bred as riding and draft animals, and as curiosities in circuses and smaller zoos.

It is the second installment of the [[Walking With...]] series and a sequel to ''[[Walking with Dinosaurs]]''. ''Beasts'' takes place after the [[extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs]] 65 million years ago depicted in ''Walking with Dinosaurs'', and recreates animals of the [[Cenozoic]] with [[computer-generated imagery]] and [[animatronics]]. Like ''Dinosaurs'', its narrative is presented in the style of a traditional [[nature documentary]]. Some of the concepts it illustrates are the [[Cetacean evolution|evolution of whales]], [[Evolution of the horse|horses]], [[elephants]] and [[Human evolution|humans]].\n\nIn North America, ''Beasts'' was broadcast on the [[Discovery Channel]] with [[Stockard Channing]] replacing [[Kenneth Branagh]] as the narrator.

Then it shows how [[Chicxulub impactor|\"an asteroid the size of Mount Everest\"]] struck the Earth and [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event|demolished the dinosaurs]], and how mammals evolved into new forms thereafter.  The first episode depicts the warm tropical world of the early [[Eocene]], sixteen million years after the [[extinction]] of the non-avian dinosaurs. Birds, the surviving lineage of the dinosaurs, including the giant carnivorous ''[[Gastornis]]'', rule this world, while mammals are still very small. The setting is near the [[Messel pit]] in [[Germany]]. Due to volcanic activity, sudden bulk escapes of [[carbon dioxide]] trapped underneath lakes pose a significant hazard to the local wildlife. The episode centers around a ''[[Leptictidium]]'' family, a leaping, shrew-like mammal, which has emerged in the dawn hours to forage for food. As the mother ''Leptictidium'' forages, first in solidarity, and then with her pups, she wanders near a large predatory mammal, identified as an ''[[Ambulocetus]]'', a \"walking whale\". Despite its crocodilian similarity, the ''Ambulocetus'' is shown swimming by [[Evolution of cetaceans|caudal undulation]] like a modern cetacean.\nA female ''Gastornis'', who has been taking care of the single egg in her nest, makes two attempts to hunt a small herd of ''[[Eurohippus|Propalaeotherium]]'', early horses. The first attempt fails when sounds among the vegetation betray her presence. The second attack proves successful when the ''Propalaeotherium'' consume fermenting grapes and are unable to evade her attack. The ''Gastornis'' also defends her territory from another ''Gastornis''. Unfortunately, while the mother hunts, a horde of ''[[Titanomyrma]]'', giant carnivorous [[ants]], encounter the egg when it was just starting to hatch, and successfully kill and eat the chick. When the female discovers her dead offspring at dusk she leaves the forest to try and start another family.\n\nWith the arrival of night, a band of lemur-like ''[[Godinotia]]'', socialize and copulate in the dark. ''Ambulocetus'' finally manages to catch a [[Creodonta|creodont]] near the lake edge. As the night wears on, an earth tremor unleashes trapped carbon dioxide out from underneath the lake and the gas suffocates most of the surrounding life. The ''Leptictidium'' survive because the nest was upwind of the gas, and ''Gastornis'' also survived because she left that area in the forest.\n\nIt is mentioned that although the ''Leptictidium'' survived the gas, they would ultimately leave no descendants, while the ''Ambulocetus'', who was killed by the lethal gases, would evolve into the whales, hereby setting the scene for the next episode.\n\n'''Animals:'''\n''[[Leptictidium]]''\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Gastornis]]''\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Ambulocetus]]''\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Eurohippus|Propalaeotherium]]'' <ref group=note>Specimen featured in episode was based on ''Propaleotherium parvulum'' which is now considered to be synonymous with ''Eurohippus''</ref>\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Godinotia]]''\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Eurotamandua]]'' (unnamed, live-acted by a [[tamandua]])\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Titanomyrma]]'' (unnamed, identified as giant ants)\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Lesmesodon]]'' (unnamed)\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Asiatosuchus]]'' (live-acted by a [[crocodile]])\n{{\u00b7}}[[Gecko]]\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' (stock footage from ''[[Walking with Dinosaurs]]'')\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Ankylosaurus]]'' (stock footage from ''[[Walking with Dinosaurs]]'')\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Didelphodon]]'' (stock footage from ''[[Walking with Dinosaurs]]'')\n|LineColor = 2155B0\n}}{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber= 2\n| Title= Whale Killer\n| Aux1= 36 mya\n| DirectedBy=Jasper James & Nigel Paterson\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2001|11|22|df=y}}\n| Viewers= 11.34\n| ShortSummary= :'''36 million years ago, Late Eocene (Pakistan/Tethys Sea)'''\n:Filming location: [[Florida]]\n[[File:Andrewsarchus head model.jpg|thumb|''[[Andrewsarchus]]'' as it appeared in ''Walking with Beasts'']]\nThe second episode is set in late [[Eocene]], when the [[polar caps]] froze over and drastically changed the Earth's [[ocean currents]] and [[climate]]. The first part of the episode explains how an early [[whale]], ''[[Basilosaurus]]'' mates and how the world is changing into an ocean [[famine]]. On land there is an ''[[Andrewsarchus]]'' driven to the beach to feed on [[sea turtle]]s. The narrator explains that ''Andrewsarchus'', the largest land mammal [[predator]] ever to walk the earth, has hooves and is related to sheep, so it is, in a sense, a \"sheep in wolf's clothing\". Back in the ocean, a starving mother ''Basilosaurus'' is forced to hunt in the [[mangrove]] swamps of [[Africa]], which will later become the [[Sahara Desert]]. Unable to catch a primate called ''[[Apidium]]'' due to a [[Physogaleus|shark]] killing one of the primates and spooking the others, she is then hunting a lone ''[[Moeritherium]]''. The ''Moeritherium'' crawls on to land, but in the mangroves, land does not last long. However the ''Moeritherium'' escapes and the ''Basilosaurus'' returns to the sea. The cast moves on to land where a herd of ''[[Embolotherium]]'' struggle to survive: one of their calves dies after birth and two ''Andrewsarchus'' feast on it, but the mother ''Embolotherium'' drives them away because she has a strong bond with her offspring, even if it is dead. Back in the sea, the mother ''Basilosaurus'' preys on a group of [[Dolphin]]-like ''[[Dorudon]]'' and their young, and is successful. The episode ends with the mother ''Basilosaurus'' swimming with her newborn calf.\n\nIt is acknowledged in the end that soon Africa will be pulled closer to Europe, causing the [[Tethys Sea]] to disappear. While whales as a whole will survive [[Eocene-Oligocene extinction event|the ensuing extinction]], ''Basilosaurus'', unfortunately, will disappear with the Tethys as well.\n\n'''Animals:'''\n''[[Basilosaurus]]''\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Andrewsarchus]]''\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Embolotherium]]'' (identified as brontothere)\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Dorudon]]''\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Moeritherium]]''\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Apidium]]''\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Physogaleus]]'' (identified as shark)\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Puppigerus]]'' (identified as turtle)\n{{\u00b7}}[[Vulture]]\n|LineColor = 2155B0\n}}{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber= 3\n| Title= Land of Giants\n| Aux1= 25  mya\n| DirectedBy=Jasper James & Nigel Paterson\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2001|11|29|df=y}}\n| Viewers= 9.27\n| ShortSummary= :'''25 million years ago, Late Oligocene (Mongolia)'''\n:Filming location: [[Mexico]], [[Arizona]]\n[[File:Entelodon Walking With Beasts.jpg|thumb|''[[Entelodon]]'' as it appeared in ''Walking with Beasts'']]\nThe third episode takes place during the late [[Oligocene]], in [[Mongolia]], where there were seasonal [[Rain|rains]] followed by a long [[drought]]. It focuses on a mother ''[[Paraceratherium]]'', a massive hornless [[rhinoceros]], the largest land mammal to ever live as one night, she gives birth to a healthy male calf, while trying to fend off the predatory ''[[Hyaenodon]]''. By morning, the calf slowly learns how to walk and after a week, his mother takes him out to the open plain where he will spend the rest of his life. The inquisitive calf runs into a mother ''[[Cynodictis]]'', who drives him out of her family burrow to protect her pups. The calf then learns to survive on his own, by copying his mother's actions. Not long after, his mother's previous calf arrives, but the mother violently repels him. A ''Hyaenodon'' is then seen stalking a herd of ''[[Chalicotherium]]'', successfully killing one, but a trio of ''[[Entelodon]]'' drive it off the carcass. During the dry season, there is a huge shortage of food and water, putting even the hardiest to their greatest stress. The mother, now dehydrated, has not been able to produce enough milk for the calf, who's getting weaker and weaker as time progresses. At night, the pair are joined by an older female, who leads them to a small, muddy lake, where they drink their fill and gain back their strength. The wet season returns, the water levels rise, flooding the ''Cynodictis'' family burrow, and drowning the sleeping pups. The mother and calf have to cross a river, the mother making it with ease, while the calf struggled to make it up a muddy bank, but he finally succeeded. 3 years pass, and the calf is furiously chased away by his mother. He then was not seen for days, but when he was seen, he was limping and had a leg injury, possibly caused by another young male ''Paraceratherium''. When he returned to his mother, she aggressively chased him away, as she now has a new calf to nurture. After 3 months, the calf learns how to stand on his own two feet and successfully drives away an ''Entelodon''.\n\n'''Animals:'''\n''[[Paraceratherium]]'' (identified as indricothere)\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Hyaenodon]]''\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Entelodon]]''\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Chalicotherium]]'' (identified as chalicothere)\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Cynodictis]]'' (identified as bear-dog)<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Haines\n | first = Tim\n | authorlink = Tim Haines\n | title = The Complete Guide to Prehistoric Life\n | url = https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781554071258\n | url-access = registration\n | publisher = Firefly Books\n | location = Canada\n | date = 2006\n | page = [https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781554071258/page/176 176]\n | isbn = 1-55407-125-9}}\n</ref>\n|LineColor = 2155B0\n}}{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber= 4\n| Title= Next of Kin\n| Aux1= 3.2  mya\n| DirectedBy=Jasper James & Nigel Paterson\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2001|12|6|df=y}}\n| Viewers= - <ref group=note>This episode did not reach the Top 30 programmes.</ref>\n| ShortSummary= :'''3.2 million years ago, Late Pliocene (Ethiopia)'''\n:Filming location: [[South Africa]], [[Ethiopia]]\n[[File:Walk With Beasts exhibition Ancylotherium model.jpg|thumb|''[[Ancylotherium]]'' as it appeared in ''Walking with Beasts'']] \nThe fourth episode takes place in the [[Great Rift Valley, Ethiopia|Great Rift Valley]] in northeastern [[Africa]] of the late [[Pliocene]]. The climate has changed, and now great grasslands have replaced trees, with many modern-day animals appearing with them. The episode focuses around a tribe of small [[hominid]]s known as ''[[Australopithecus]]'', one of the first [[ape]]s able to walk upright and a close ancestor to [[humans]]. The ''Australopithecus'' has evolved to walk upright so as to better manoeuvre the plains as well as the climb the trees. However, it notes that although the ''Australopithecus'' looks human, it still only has a brain the size of a [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]'s. Some of the topics explored in the episode are the close social bonds among the [[tribe]], how they use [[Social grooming|grooming]] as a means of [[communication]], and how they work together to forage for food and to defend one another from attacks from such animals as an angry male ''[[Deinotherium]]'', an ancestor of the modern [[elephant]] which they have to run from to avoid being crushed, and the [[Felidae|feline]] predator ''[[Dinofelis]]''. It touches upon how competing tribes of ''Australopithecus'' war among one another, although most of the fighting is for show. It also explains the [[hierarchy]] in the tribe among the males, who are much larger than the females, and tells a story of how the dominating male nicknamed Grey is eventually overcome by another male nicknamed Hercules, who wins the right to feed first at a carrion and to mate with the females. The main story tells of a young ''Australopithecus'' nicknamed Blue whose mother has been killed by malaria. He and his tribe are later forced to flee their homeland during a fight over a waterhole with a rival tribe. After a long journey in search of a new home, Blue fits into his tribe by rallying them into scaring off a hungry ''Dinofelis''.\n\n'''Animals:'''\n''[[Australopithecus]]''\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Dinofelis]]''\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Deinotherium]]''\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Ancylotherium]]''\n{{\u00b7}}[[Common warthog]]\n{{\u00b7}}[[White rhinoceros]]\n{{\u00b7}}[[Black-backed jackal]]\n{{\u00b7}}[[White-backed vulture]]\n{{\u00b7}}[[Zebra]] (carcass)\n{{\u00b7}}[[Ostrich]] (egg)\n\n|LineColor = 2155B0\n}}{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber= 5\n| Title= Sabre Tooth\n| Aux1= 1 mya\n| DirectedBy=Jasper James & Nigel Paterson\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2001|12|13|df=y}}\n| Viewers= 5.87\n| ShortSummary= :'''1 million years ago, Early Pleistocene (Paraguay)'''\n:Filming location: [[Brazil]]\n[[File:Phorusrhacos - Walk With Beasts.jpg|thumb|''[[Phorusrhacos]]'' as it appeared in ''Walking with Beasts'']]\nThe fifth episode shows the strange [[fauna]] of the isolated continent of [[South America]] and explores the effects of the [[Great American Interchange]], which had happened 1.5 million years earlier. Since South America had drifted apart from [[Antarctica]] 30 million years ago, many unique [[mammals]] had evolved, including the ''[[Doedicurus]]'', an armoured [[armadillo]]-like mammal with a cannon ball-sized spiked club on its tail; the ''[[Macrauchenia]],'' a [[camel]]-like mammal with a long trunk; and the ''[[Megatherium]]'', a giant [[ground sloth]]. Before the continents of South America and [[North America]] collided, a 10-foot-tall predatory [[Phorusrhacidae|terror bird]] called ''[[Phorusrhacos]]'', had reigned as [[top predator]]. However, the great cats migrating from the north, soon displaced them as top predators. The episode focuses on a male ''[[Smilodon]],'' a [[sabre-toothed cat]], called Half Tooth, whose leadership of a [[pride]] is threatened by two rival males who are brothers and work together against him. Half Tooth wisely backs off without any serious injuries, feeling that the rival males would be too strong for him. The rival males kill Half Tooth's cubs, and take over his pride. Next, the episode shows the ''Smilodon'' hunting down ''Macrauchenia'' and trying to protect the remaining two young from the two males. In the background, ''Phorusrhacos'' wait to scavenge the ''Macrauchenia'', which the pride of ''Smilodon''  have killed. However, a ''Megatherium'' charges the ''Smilodon'', in order to eat some of the carrion as a diet supplement. In the process, the ''Megatherium'' kills the dominant rival male, enabling Half Tooth to return, kill the other male and reclaim his territory. A year later, his mate has another litter of cubs.\n\n'''Animals:'''\n''[[Smilodon]]''\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Phorusrhacos]]''\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Macrauchenia]]''\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Megatherium]]''\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Doedicurus]]''\n|LineColor = 2155B0\n}}{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber= 6\n| Title= Mammoth Journey\n| Aux1=  30,000 ya\n| DirectedBy=Jasper James & Nigel Paterson\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2001|12|20|df=y}}\n| Viewers= 9.48\n| ShortSummary= :'''30,000 years ago, Late Pleistocene (Belgium)'''\n:Filming location: [[Yukon]]\n[[File:Woolly Rhinoceros Hunt.jpg|thumb|[[Woolly rhinoceros]] as it appeared in ''Walking with Beasts'']]\nThe sixth episode takes place during the last [[Ice Age]] of the late [[Pleistocene]]. It starts in the peak of the summer. The [[North Sea]] has become a [[Doggerland|grassy plain]] because the ice at the polar caps has caused the [[sea level]]s to drop significantly. Grazing on the plain are herds of [[woolly mammoth]]s, [[saiga antelope]]s, and [[bison]]. A clan of [[Cro-Magnon]] is also there spending the summer. The central focus of the episode is the migration of the herd of mammoths as they travel 400 kilometres from the North Sea to the [[Swiss Alps]] for the winter and then back again in the spring. As the mammoth herd migrates south, the episode shows two large [[deer]], the [[elk]]-like ''[[Irish elk|Megaloceros]]'', fighting for rights to a [[harem]] of females. As the male elk fight, a group of Cro-Magnons ambushes them and kills one. A mother mammoth and her baby are separated from the herd, but survive an encounter with a [[Panthera leo spelaea|European cave lion]]. When the herd of mammoths reaches the Swiss Alps, the mother and baby mammoth reunite with their herd. The episode also depicts a clan of [[Neanderthal]]s, who have especially evolved to survive in the cold climate. One is charged by a [[woolly rhinoceros]], but escapes, in part because of his stocky constitution. The climax of the episode is when the clan of Neanderthals attack the herd of mammoth as they turn back to the north. The Neanderthals are gifted hunters who are able to chase two mammoths off a cliff by using [[fire]] and spears, one of them being the matriarch of the herd. The episode ends in the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]] with people looking at various [[skeleton]]s of some descendants of the animals featured in the series. The camera then pulls back through the roof of the [[museum]] until the whole world is visible. The narrator states that, \"We have since built museums to celebrate the past, and spent decades studying prehistoric lives.

It is the second installment of the [[Walking With...]] series and a sequel to ''[[Walking with Dinosaurs]]''. ''Beasts'' takes place after the [[extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs]] 65 million years ago depicted in ''Walking with Dinosaurs'', and recreates animals of the [[Cenozoic]] with [[computer-generated imagery]] and [[animatronics]]. Like ''Dinosaurs'', its narrative is presented in the style of a traditional [[nature documentary]]. Some of the concepts it illustrates are the [[Cetacean evolution|evolution of whales]], [[Evolution of the horse|horses]], [[elephants]] and [[Human evolution|humans]].\n\nIn North America, ''Beasts'' was broadcast on the [[Discovery Channel]] with [[Stockard Channing]] replacing [[Kenneth Branagh]] as the narrator. It would later be re-edited and re-narrated for the second season of ''[[Prehistoric Planet]]'' for the [[Discovery Kids]] lineup, with [[Christian Slater]] providing the narration instead of [[Kenneth Branagh]].\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Walk With Beasts exhibition.jpg|thumb|left|Puppet heads used in the series, [[Horniman Museum]], London]] \nProducer [[Tim Haines]] wanted to create a sequel to ''Walking with Dinosaurs'' so the general public could discover the fascinating mammals of the Cenozoic, which were less represented in popular culture [[Dinosaurs in popular culture|than dinosaurs]].<ref>{{cite video|title=Tim Haines Production Interview|medium=DVD featurette|people=Tim Haines|date=2002|publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\nAs with ''Walking with Dinosaurs'', the film crews would go to locations that matched the depicted time periods fairly closely and shoot either empty landscapes (when the animals would be created later with CGI) or [[animatronic]] animals for close-ups.

Then it shows how [[Chicxulub impactor|\"an asteroid the size of Mount Everest\"]] struck the Earth and [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event|demolished the dinosaurs]], and how mammals evolved into new forms thereafter.  The first episode depicts the warm tropical world of the early [[Eocene]], sixteen million years after the [[extinction]] of the non-avian dinosaurs. Birds, the surviving lineage of the dinosaurs, including the giant carnivorous ''[[Gastornis]]'', rule this world, while mammals are still very small. The setting is near the [[Messel pit]] in [[Germany]]. Due to volcanic activity, sudden bulk escapes of [[carbon dioxide]] trapped underneath lakes pose a significant hazard to the local wildlife. The episode centers around a ''[[Leptictidium]]'' family, a leaping, shrew-like mammal, which has emerged in the dawn hours to forage for food. As the mother ''Leptictidium'' forages, first in solidarity, and then with her pups, she wanders near a large predatory mammal, identified as an ''[[Ambulocetus]]'', a \"walking whale\". Despite its crocodilian similarity, the ''Ambulocetus'' is shown swimming by [[Evolution of cetaceans|caudal undulation]] like a modern cetacean.\nA female ''Gastornis'', who has been taking care of the single egg in her nest, makes two attempts to hunt a small herd of ''[[Eurohippus|Propalaeotherium]]'', early horses. The first attempt fails when sounds among the vegetation betray her presence. The second attack proves successful when the ''Propalaeotherium'' consume fermenting grapes and are unable to evade her attack. The ''Gastornis'' also defends her territory from another ''Gastornis''. Unfortunately, while the mother hunts, a horde of ''[[Titanomyrma]]'', giant carnivorous [[ants]], encounter the egg when it was just starting to hatch, and successfully kill and eat the chick. When the female discovers her dead offspring at dusk she leaves the forest to try and start another family.\n\nWith the arrival of night, a band of lemur-like ''[[Godinotia]]'', socialize and copulate in the dark. ''Ambulocetus'' finally manages to catch a [[Creodonta|creodont]] near the lake edge. As the night wears on, an earth tremor unleashes trapped carbon dioxide out from underneath the lake and the gas suffocates most of the surrounding life. The ''Leptictidium'' survive because the nest was upwind of the gas, and ''Gastornis'' also survived because she left that area in the forest.\n\nIt is mentioned that although the ''Leptictidium'' survived the gas, they would ultimately leave no descendants, while the ''Ambulocetus'', who was killed by the lethal gases, would evolve into the whales, hereby setting the scene for the next episode.\n\n'''Animals:'''\n''[[Leptictidium]]''\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Gastornis]]''\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Ambulocetus]]''\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Eurohippus|Propalaeotherium]]'' <ref group=note>Specimen featured in episode was based on ''Propaleotherium parvulum'' which is now considered to be synonymous with ''Eurohippus''</ref>\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Godinotia]]''\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Eurotamandua]]'' (unnamed, live-acted by a [[tamandua]])\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Titanomyrma]]'' (unnamed, identified as giant ants)\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Lesmesodon]]'' (unnamed)\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Crocodile]]''\n{{\u00b7}}[[Gecko]]\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' (stock footage from ''[[Walking with Dinosaurs]]'')\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Ankylosaurus]]'' (stock footage from ''[[Walking with Dinosaurs]]'')\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Didelphodon]]'' (stock footage from ''[[Walking with Dinosaurs]]'')\n|LineColor = 2155B0\n}}{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber= 2\n| Title= Whale Killer\n| Aux1= 36 mya\n| DirectedBy=Jasper James & Nigel Paterson\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2001|11|22|df=y}}\n| Viewers= 11.34\n| ShortSummary= :'''36 million years ago, Late Eocene (Pakistan/Tethys Sea)'''\n:Filming location: [[Florida]]\n[[File:Andrewsarchus head model.jpg|thumb|''[[Andrewsarchus]]'' as it appeared in ''Walking with Beasts'']]\nThe second episode is set in late [[Eocene]], when the [[polar caps]] froze over and drastically changed the Earth's [[ocean currents]] and [[climate]]. The first part of the episode explains how an early [[whale]], ''[[Basilosaurus]]'' mates and how the world is changing into an ocean [[famine]]. On land there is an ''[[Andrewsarchus]]'' driven to the beach to feed on [[sea turtle]]s. The narrator explains that ''Andrewsarchus'', the largest land mammal [[predator]] ever to walk the earth, has hooves and is related to sheep, so it is, in a sense, a \"sheep in wolf's clothing\". Back in the ocean, a starving mother ''Basilosaurus'' is forced to hunt in the [[mangrove]] swamps of [[Africa]], which will later become the [[Sahara Desert]]. Unable to catch a primate called ''[[Apidium]]'' due to a [[Physogaleus|shark]] killing one of the primates and spooking the others, she is then hunting a lone ''[[Moeritherium]]''. The ''Moeritherium'' crawls on to land, but in the mangroves, land does not last long. However the ''Moeritherium'' escapes and the ''Basilosaurus'' returns to the sea. The cast moves on to land where a herd of ''[[Embolotherium]]'' struggle to survive: one of their calves dies after birth and two ''Andrewsarchus'' feast on it, but the mother ''Embolotherium'' drives them away because she has a strong bond with her offspring, even if it is dead. Back in the sea, the mother ''Basilosaurus'' preys on a group of [[Dolphin]]-like ''[[Dorudon]]'' and their young, and is successful. The episode ends with the mother ''Basilosaurus'' swimming with her newborn calf.\n\nIt is acknowledged in the end that soon Africa will be pulled closer to Europe, causing the [[Tethys Sea]] to disappear. While whales as a whole will survive [[Eocene-Oligocene extinction event|the ensuing extinction]], ''Basilosaurus'', unfortunately, will disappear with the Tethys as well.\n\n'''Animals:'''\n''[[Basilosaurus]]''\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Andrewsarchus]]''\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Embolotherium]]'' (identified as brontothere)\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Dorudon]]''\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Moeritherium]]''\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Apidium]]''\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Physogaleus]]'' (identified as shark)\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Puppigerus]]'' (identified as turtle)\n{{\u00b7}}[[Vulture]]\n|LineColor = 2155B0\n}}{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber= 3\n| Title= Land of Giants\n| Aux1= 25  mya\n| DirectedBy=Jasper James & Nigel Paterson\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2001|11|29|df=y}}\n| Viewers= 9.27\n| ShortSummary= :'''25 million years ago, Late Oligocene (Mongolia)'''\n:Filming location: [[Mexico]], [[Arizona]]\n[[File:Entelodon Walking With Beasts.jpg|thumb|''[[Entelodon]]'' as it appeared in ''Walking with Beasts'']]\nThe third episode takes place during the late [[Oligocene]], in [[Mongolia]], where there were seasonal [[Rain|rains]] followed by a long [[drought]]. It focuses on a mother ''[[Paraceratherium]]'', a massive hornless [[rhinoceros]], the largest land mammal to ever live as one night, she gives birth to a healthy male calf, while trying to fend off the predatory ''[[Hyaenodon]]''. By morning, the calf slowly learns how to walk and after a week, his mother takes him out to the open plain where he will spend the rest of his life. The inquisitive calf runs into a mother ''[[Cynodictis]]'', who drives him out of her family burrow to protect her pups. The calf then learns to survive on his own, by copying his mother's actions. Not long after, his mother's previous calf arrives, but the mother violently repels him. A ''Hyaenodon'' is then seen stalking a herd of ''[[Chalicotherium]]'', successfully killing one, but a trio of ''[[Entelodon]]'' drive it off the carcass. During the dry season, there is a huge shortage of food and water, putting even the hardiest to their greatest stress. The mother, now dehydrated, has not been able to produce enough milk for the calf, who's getting weaker and weaker as time progresses. At night, the pair are joined by an older female, who leads them to a small, muddy lake, where they drink their fill and gain back their strength. The wet season returns, the water levels rise, flooding the ''Cynodictis'' family burrow, and drowning the sleeping pups. The mother and calf have to cross a river, the mother making it with ease, while the calf struggled to make it up a muddy bank, but he finally succeeded. 3 years pass, and the calf is furiously chased away by his mother. He then was not seen for days, but when he was seen, he was limping and had a leg injury, possibly caused by another young male ''Paraceratherium''. When he returned to his mother, she aggressively chased him away, as she now has a new calf to nurture. After 3 months, the calf learns how to stand on his own two feet and successfully drives away an ''Entelodon''.\n\n'''Animals:'''\n''[[Paraceratherium]]'' (identified as indricothere)\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Hyaenodon]]''\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Entelodon]]''\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Chalicotherium]]'' (identified as chalicothere)\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Cynodictis]]'' (identified as bear-dog)<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Haines\n | first = Tim\n | authorlink = Tim Haines\n | title = The Complete Guide to Prehistoric Life\n | url = https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781554071258\n | url-access = registration\n | publisher = Firefly Books\n | location = Canada\n | date = 2006\n | page = [https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781554071258/page/176 176]\n | isbn = 1-55407-125-9}}\n</ref>\n|LineColor = 2155B0\n}}{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber= 4\n| Title= Next of Kin\n| Aux1= 3.2  mya\n| DirectedBy=Jasper James & Nigel Paterson\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2001|12|6|df=y}}\n| Viewers= - <ref group=note>This episode did not reach the Top 30 programmes.</ref>\n| ShortSummary= :'''3.2 million years ago, Late Pliocene (Ethiopia)'''\n:Filming location: [[South Africa]], [[Ethiopia]]\n[[File:Walk With Beasts exhibition Ancylotherium model.jpg|thumb|''[[Ancylotherium]]'' as it appeared in ''Walking with Beasts'']] \nThe fourth episode takes place in the [[Great Rift Valley, Ethiopia|Great Rift Valley]] in northeastern [[Africa]] of the late [[Pliocene]]. The climate has changed, and now great grasslands have replaced trees, with many modern-day animals appearing with them. The episode focuses around a tribe of small [[hominid]]s known as ''[[Australopithecus]]'', one of the first [[ape]]s able to walk upright and a close ancestor to [[humans]]. The ''Australopithecus'' has evolved to walk upright so as to better manoeuvre the plains as well as the climb the trees. However, it notes that although the ''Australopithecus'' looks human, it still only has a brain the size of a [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]'s. Some of the topics explored in the episode are the close social bonds among the [[tribe]], how they use [[Social grooming|grooming]] as a means of [[communication]], and how they work together to forage for food and to defend one another from attacks from such animals as an angry male ''[[Deinotherium]]'', an ancestor of the modern [[elephant]] which they have to run from to avoid being crushed, and the [[Felidae|feline]] predator ''[[Dinofelis]]''. It touches upon how competing tribes of ''Australopithecus'' war among one another, although most of the fighting is for show. It also explains the [[hierarchy]] in the tribe among the males, who are much larger than the females, and tells a story of how the dominating male nicknamed Grey is eventually overcome by another male nicknamed Hercules, who wins the right to feed first at a carrion and to mate with the females. The main story tells of a young ''Australopithecus'' nicknamed Blue whose mother has been killed by malaria. He and his tribe are later forced to flee their homeland during a fight over a waterhole with a rival tribe. After a long journey in search of a new home, Blue fits into his tribe by rallying them into scaring off a hungry ''Dinofelis''.\n\n'''Animals:'''\n''[[Australopithecus]]''\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Dinofelis]]''\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Deinotherium]]''\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Ancylotherium]]''\n{{\u00b7}}[[Common warthog]]\n{{\u00b7}}[[White rhinoceros]]\n{{\u00b7}}[[Black-backed jackal]]\n{{\u00b7}}[[White-backed vulture]]\n{{\u00b7}}[[Zebra]] (carcass)\n{{\u00b7}}[[Ostrich]] (egg)\n\n|LineColor = 2155B0\n}}{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber= 5\n| Title= Sabre Tooth\n| Aux1= 1 mya\n| DirectedBy=Jasper James & Nigel Paterson\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2001|12|13|df=y}}\n| Viewers= 5.87\n| ShortSummary= :'''1 million years ago, Early Pleistocene (Paraguay)'''\n:Filming location: [[Brazil]]\n[[File:Phorusrhacos - Walk With Beasts.jpg|thumb|''[[Phorusrhacos]]'' as it appeared in ''Walking with Beasts'']]\nThe fifth episode shows the strange [[fauna]] of the isolated continent of [[South America]] and explores the effects of the [[Great American Interchange]], which had happened 1.5 million years earlier. Since South America had drifted apart from [[Antarctica]] 30 million years ago, many unique [[mammals]] had evolved, including the ''[[Doedicurus]]'', an armoured [[armadillo]]-like mammal with a cannon ball-sized spiked club on its tail; the ''[[Macrauchenia]],'' a [[camel]]-like mammal with a long trunk; and the ''[[Megatherium]]'', a giant [[ground sloth]]. Before the continents of South America and [[North America]] collided, a 10-foot-tall predatory [[Phorusrhacidae|terror bird]] called ''[[Phorusrhacos]]'', had reigned as [[top predator]]. However, the great cats migrating from the north, soon displaced them as top predators. The episode focuses on a male ''[[Smilodon]],'' a [[sabre-toothed cat]], called Half Tooth, whose leadership of a [[pride]] is threatened by two rival males who are brothers and work together against him. Half Tooth wisely backs off without any serious injuries, feeling that the rival males would be too strong for him. The rival males kill Half Tooth's cubs, and take over his pride. Next, the episode shows the ''Smilodon'' hunting down ''Macrauchenia'' and trying to protect the remaining two young from the two males. In the background, ''Phorusrhacos'' wait to scavenge the ''Macrauchenia'', which the pride of ''Smilodon''  have killed.

It starts in the peak of the summer. The [[North Sea]] has become a [[Doggerland|grassy plain]] because the ice at the polar caps has caused the [[sea level]]s to drop significantly. Grazing on the plain are herds of [[woolly mammoth]]s, [[saiga antelope]]s, and [[bison]]. A clan of [[Cro-Magnon]] is also there spending the summer. The central focus of the episode is the migration of the herd of mammoths as they travel 400 kilometres from the North Sea to the [[Swiss Alps]] for the winter and then back again in the spring. As the mammoth herd migrates south, the episode shows two large [[deer]], the [[elk]]-like ''[[Irish elk|Megaloceros]]'', fighting for rights to a [[harem]] of females. As the male elk fight, a group of Cro-Magnons ambushes them and kills one. A mother mammoth and her baby are separated from the herd, but survive an encounter with a [[Panthera leo spelaea|European cave lion]]. When the herd of mammoths reaches the Swiss Alps, the mother and baby mammoth reunite with their herd. The episode also depicts a clan of [[Neanderthal]]s, who have especially evolved to survive in the cold climate. One is charged by a [[woolly rhinoceros]], but escapes, in part because of his stocky constitution. The climax of the episode is when the clan of Neanderthals attack the herd of mammoth as they turn back to the north. The Neanderthals are gifted hunters who are able to chase two mammoths off a cliff by using [[fire]] and spears, one of them being the matriarch of the herd. The episode ends in the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]] with people looking at various [[skeleton]]s of some descendants of the animals featured in the series. The camera then pulls back through the roof of the [[museum]] until the whole world is visible. The narrator states that, \"We have since built museums to celebrate the past, and spent decades studying prehistoric lives. And if all this has taught us anything, it is this: no species lasts forever.\"\n\n'''Animals:'''\n[[Woolly Mammoth]] \n{{\u00b7}}''[[Irish elk|Megaloceros]]''\n{{\u00b7}}[[Woolly Rhinoceros]]\n{{\u00b7}}[[Cro-Magnon]] (identified as humans)\n{{\u00b7}}''[[Panthera spelaea]]'' (identified as cave lion)\n{{\u00b7}}[[Neanderthal]]\n{{\u00b7}}[[Saiga antelope]]\n{{\u00b7}}[[Wolf]]\n{{\u00b7}}[[Wisent]]\n\n|LineColor = 2155B0\n}}\n}}\n</div>\n\n===''The Science of Walking with Beasts''===\nA two-episode companion documentary, ''The Science of Walking with Beasts'', aired in November 2001 on [[BBC One]].

However, it was a critical battle for the future border of Virginia and West Virginia, ensuring Highland County remained in Confederate hands and not involved in the formation of the future state of West Virginia<ref>https://www.richmond.com/special-section/battle-shaped-destiny-of-virginia-west-virginia/article_228cc12d-12a6-57cb-bdff-815e4ff7364f.html?mode=jqm&alt=gal&pos=1</ref>. \n\n==Background==\nIn December, [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] forces under [[Colonel (United States)|Col.]] [[Edward Johnson (general)|Edward Johnson]] occupied the summit pass of Allegheny Mountain (roughly 4,400 feet above sea level)  to defend the  [[Staunton and Parkersburg Turnpike]] that offered a point of access from the mountains of western Virginia into the strategic Shenandoah Valley. The occupation of the high mountain pass coincided with a bitter winter, with much suffering and disease among the Southern troops<ref>https://www.virginia.org/listings/HistoricSites/CampAlleghenyConfederateOutpost/</ref>. Early Union victories in what is now West Virginia had solidified control in much of the western mountains of Virginia, emboldening a Union move to take the Staunton to Petersburg Pike<ref>https://www.battlefields.org/learn/civil-war/battles/camp-allegheny</ref>. Perhaps thinking that Confederate morale was low<ref>https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/191</ref>, a [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] brigade of 2,000 under [[Brigadier General|Brig. Gen.]] [[Robert H. Milroy]] attacked Johnson and his 1,200 Confederates at sunrise on December 13.<ref name=\"ABPP\" /><ref>https://www.battlefields.org/learn/civil-war/battles/camp-allegheny</ref>\n\n==Battle==\nMilroy's advance and a Confederate scouting party had skirmished on December 12. The next morning, Milroy divided his troops into a two pronged attack to flank the Confederate camp. The first column advanced up the Staunton-Parkersburg Pike, engaging the Confederate right side for several hours before withdrawing. Beause of the difficult mountain terrain, the second Union column arrived shortly after the withdrawal of the first column, unable to suuport the main body of Union troops on the right<ref>https://www.mycivilwar.com/battles/611213.html</ref>, but then attacked the Confederate left<ref>https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/191</ref>. \n\n[[File:Camp_Allegheny_Battlefield_West_Virginia.jpg|305px|thumb|right|Map of Camp Allegheny Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]].]]\nIn a piercing winter wind, fighting raged for much of the sunny morning as each side maneuvered on the hillside slopes, fields and woods to gain the advantage. On the right flank, Milroy's strong force was in a mountain clearing, among the fallen timber, stumps and brush, which proved to be too difficult for the Confederate infantry to dislodge. A Confederate [[artillery|artillery battery]] unlimbered and unleashed a \"storm of round shot and canister among them, knocking their timber defences about their heads, and making their nest too hot to hold them...\" The fighting moved back and forth from advance to retreat, with the Union temporarily occupying the post, only to be driven off. The Confederates attempted their own flanking maneuvers which quickly failed because their force was too thin. The fighting was in such close quarters that eight of the Confederate cannons in the fortification could not be used<ref>https://www.mycivilwar.com/battles/611213.html</ref>.  After fighting for over seven hours<ref>https://emergingcivilwar.com/2012/11/24/a-historians-stroll-across-camp-allegheny/</ref> Milroy's troops finally withdrew, retreating to his camps at Green Spring Run near Cheat Mountain. Johnson's losses were high: 25 men were killed and 97 were wounded in the engagement, plus 23 went missing.\n\nAccording to one Confederate soldier in the [[52nd Virginia Infantry]]:<ref name=\"JSR\" />\n<blockquote>I had a splendid position in this battle and could see the whole fight without having to take any part in it, and I remember how I thought Colonel Johnson must be the most wonderful hero in the world, as I saw him at one point, where his men were hard pressed, snatch a musket in one hand and, swinging a big club in the other, he led his line right up among the enemy, driving them headlong down the mountain, killing and wounding many with the bayonet and capturing a large number of prisoners...</blockquote>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe battle, though considered insignificant compared to later battles in the Civil War, was actually one of the bloodiest in the initial year of the war<ref>https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/191</ref>. The Union casualties are estimated at 137 and Confederate casualities at 147<ref>https://www.battlefields.org/learn/civil-war/battles/camp-allegheny</ref>. Johnson would receive the nickname \"Allegheny\" Johnson for his role at the battle and for commanding the forbidding mountainous Camp Allegheny post. \n\nIronically, the Confederates had received orders to withdraw a few days prior to the battle<ref>https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/191</ref>. But the failed Union advance convinced the Confederate higher command to reinforce Johnson\u2019s force in place at Camp Allegheny with five regiments through the remainder of the harsh winter of 1861\u201362<ref>https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/191</ref><ref>http://www.civilwar.com/history/battles/battle-summaries-19937/148062-camp-alleghany.html</ref>. The snow was often knee to waist deep. The toll on the Confederate troops was brutal. In March 18, 1862, prior to the subsequent [[Battle of McDowell]] in Highland County (May 8, 1862,) Johnson, by then promoted to General, had roughly 4,000 men stationed at Camp Allegheny in Pocahontas County, but his effective strength was only 2,784, as nearly 1,200 men were sick or unavailable<ref>http://www.shenandoahatwar.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/McDowell-Battlefield-Driving-Tour.pdf</ref>. \n\nAfter the Battle of Camp Allegheny, Johnson also knew that the post was vulnerable to being flanked, and believed that  Shenandoah Mountain, 40 miles to the southeast, was a better position to defend the Staunton to Parkerburg Pike and Shenandoah Valley. Combined with the loss of men in the bitter mountain weather and the logistical challenges of keeping the remote mountain post effectively supplied, [[General Robert E. Lee]] agreed to let Johnson abandon the post in favor of Shenandoah Mountain on April 2, 1862<ref>https://www.battlefields.org/visit/heritage-sites/camp-allegheny</ref>. By April 6, 1862, Johnson's constructed [[Fort Edward Johnson]] at the site on Shenandoah Mountain, 26 miles west of Staunton. The new fortification was soon abandoned on April 19, when Johnson left to rendezvous with [[Gen. Thomas \"Stonewall\"Jackson]] in advance of the Battle of McDowell.\n\nThe battles in the rugged and mountainous region of western Virginia were small by later standards but left an enduring footprint because those counties that were in Union control formed the nucleus of the new state of West Virginia. Because of the Battle of Camp Allegheny (and the subsequent Battle of McDowell,) the future state line between Virginia and West Virginia would begin and stop at the Pocohantas and Highland County line, even though the counties shared the same geographic traits and mountain culture. Pocohantas County would remained in Union Control, Highland County in Confederate hands. As a result, Highland County would not participate in the councils and voting for secession to West Virginia, but continued as part of the state of Virginia<ref>https://www.richmond.com/special-section/battle-shaped-destiny-of-virginia-west-virginia/article_228cc12d-12a6-57cb-bdff-815e4ff7364f.html?mode=jqm&alt=gal&pos=1</ref>.\n\nIn 1903, Ambrose Bierce wrote a column in The New York American about the visiting the battle site, entitled \"A Bivouac of the Dead<ref>http://www.online-literature.com/bierce/765/</ref>,\" recalling his involvement in the battle as a member of a Union regiment.

Beause of the difficult mountain terrain, the second Union column arrived shortly after the withdrawal of the first column, unable to suuport the main body of Union troops on the right<ref>https://www.mycivilwar.com/battles/611213.html</ref>, but then attacked the Confederate left<ref>https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/191</ref>. \n\n[[File:Camp_Allegheny_Battlefield_West_Virginia.jpg|305px|thumb|right|Map of Camp Allegheny Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]].]]\nIn a piercing winter wind, fighting raged for much of the sunny morning as each side maneuvered on the hillside slopes, fields and woods to gain the advantage. On the right flank, Milroy's strong force was in a mountain clearing, among the fallen timber, stumps and brush, which proved to be too difficult for the Confederate infantry to dislodge. A Confederate [[artillery|artillery battery]] unlimbered and unleashed a \"storm of round shot and canister among them, knocking their timber defences about their heads, and making their nest too hot to hold them...\" The fighting moved back and forth from advance to retreat, with the Union temporarily occupying the post, only to be driven off. The Confederates attempted their own flanking maneuvers which quickly failed because their force was too thin. The fighting was in such close quarters that eight of the Confederate cannons in the fortification could not be used<ref>https://www.mycivilwar.com/battles/611213.html</ref>.  After fighting for over seven hours<ref>https://emergingcivilwar.com/2012/11/24/a-historians-stroll-across-camp-allegheny/</ref> Milroy's troops finally withdrew, retreating to his camps at Green Spring Run near Cheat Mountain. Johnson's losses were high: 25 men were killed and 97 were wounded in the engagement, plus 23 went missing.\n\nAccording to one Confederate soldier in the [[52nd Virginia Infantry]]:<ref name=\"JSR\" />\n<blockquote>I had a splendid position in this battle and could see the whole fight without having to take any part in it, and I remember how I thought Colonel Johnson must be the most wonderful hero in the world, as I saw him at one point, where his men were hard pressed, snatch a musket in one hand and, swinging a big club in the other, he led his line right up among the enemy, driving them headlong down the mountain, killing and wounding many with the bayonet and capturing a large number of prisoners...</blockquote>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe battle, though considered insignificant compared to later battles in the Civil War, was actually one of the bloodiest in the initial year of the war<ref>https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/191</ref>. The Union casualties are estimated at 137 and Confederate casualities at 147<ref>https://www.battlefields.org/learn/civil-war/battles/camp-allegheny</ref>. Johnson would receive the nickname \"Allegheny\" Johnson for his role at the battle and for commanding the forbidding mountainous Camp Allegheny post. \n\nIronically, the Confederates had received orders to withdraw a few days prior to the battle<ref>https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/191</ref>. But the failed Union advance convinced the Confederate higher command to reinforce Johnson\u2019s force in place at Camp Allegheny with five regiments through the remainder of the harsh winter of 1861\u201362<ref>https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/191</ref><ref>http://www.civilwar.com/history/battles/battle-summaries-19937/148062-camp-alleghany.html</ref>. The snow was often knee to waist deep. The toll on the Confederate troops was brutal. In March 18, 1862, prior to the subsequent [[Battle of McDowell]] in Highland County (May 8, 1862,) Johnson, by then promoted to General, had roughly 4,000 men stationed at Camp Allegheny in Pocahontas County, but his effective strength was only 2,784, as nearly 1,200 men were sick or unavailable<ref>http://www.shenandoahatwar.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/McDowell-Battlefield-Driving-Tour.pdf</ref>. After the Battle of Camp Allegheny, Johnson also knew that the post was vulnerable to being flanked, and believed that  Shenandoah Mountain, 40 miles to the southeast, was a better position to defend the Staunton to Parkerburg Pike and Shenandoah Valley. Combined with the loss of men in the bitter mountain weather and the logistical challenges of keeping the remote mountain post effectively supplied, [[General Robert E. Lee]] agreed to let Johnson abandon the post in favor of Shenandoah Mountain on April 2, 1862<ref>https://www.battlefields.org/visit/heritage-sites/camp-allegheny</ref>. By April 6, 1862, Johnson's constructed [[Fort Edward Johnson]] at the site on Shenandoah Mountain, 26 miles west of Staunton. The new fortification was soon abandoned on April 19, when Johnson left to rendezvous with [[Gen. Thomas \"Stonewall\"Jackson]] in advance of the Battle of McDowell.\n\nThe battles in the rugged and mountainous region of western Virginia were small by later standards but left an enduring footprint because those counties that were in Union control formed the nucleus of the new state of West Virginia. Because of the Battle of Camp Allegheny (and the subsequent Battle of McDowell,) the future state line between Virginia and West Virginia would begin and stop at the Pocohantas and Highland County line, even though the counties shared the same geographic traits and mountain culture. Pocohantas County would remained in Union Control, Highland County in Confederate hands. As a result, Highland County would not participate in the councils and voting for secession to West Virginia, but continued as part of the state of Virginia<ref>https://www.richmond.com/special-section/battle-shaped-destiny-of-virginia-west-virginia/article_228cc12d-12a6-57cb-bdff-815e4ff7364f.html?mode=jqm&alt=gal&pos=1</ref>.\n\nIn 1903, Ambrose Bierce wrote a column in The New York American about the visiting the battle site, entitled \"A Bivouac of the Dead<ref>http://www.online-literature.com/bierce/765/</ref>,\" recalling his involvement in the battle as a member of a Union regiment. Bierce wrote movingly about the sacrifice and suffering of the men in this little remembered battle in a remote area, and hauntingly about how little the battlefield had changed<ref>http://www.ambrosebierce.org/journal1owens.html</ref>.\n\n==Camp Allegheny Historic District==\n{{Infobox NRHP\n  | name = Camp Allegheny\n  | embed =no\n  | nrhp_type = hd  | nocat = yes\n  | image = \n  | caption = \n  | location= County Route 3, just east of County Route 5 at Top of Allegheny, near [[Bartow, West Virginia]]\n  | locmapin = West Virginia#USA\n  | map_width = 305\n  | built = 1861\n  | architecture = \n  | added = September 28, 1990\n  | area = 105 acres\n  | governing_body = Federal \n  | refnum = 90001446<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe '''Camp Allegheny Historic District''' is a national [[Historic district (United States)|historic district]] encompassing one contributing structure and four contributing sites.
