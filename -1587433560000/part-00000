His stage name, Midge, is a [[phonetic reversal]] of Jim, the [[diminutive]] form of his actual name.\n\nUre enjoyed particular success in the 1970s and '80s in bands including [[Slik]], [[Thin Lizzy]], [[Rich Kids]] and [[Visage (band)|Visage]], and most notably as frontman of [[Ultravox]]. In 1984, Ure co-wrote and produced the charity single \"[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]\", which has sold 3.7 million copies in the UK. The song is the second highest selling single in UK chart history.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/nov/04/uk-million-selling-singles-full-list |title=UK's million-selling singles: the full list |last=Sedghi |first= Ami |newspaper=The Guardian |location= London |date=4 November 2012 |accessdate=20 April 2013}}</ref> Ure co-organised [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]], [[Live Aid]] and [[Live 8]] with [[Bob Geldof]].

In 1985, his solo debut album ''[[The Gift (Midge Ure album)|The Gift]]'' reached number two in the [[UK Albums Chart]] and yielded the UK number one single, \"[[If I Was]]\". Ure also co-wrote [[Phil Lynott]]'s \"[[Yellow Pearl (song)|Yellow Pearl]]\", which served as the theme of ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' for much of the 1980s.\n\n==Career==\n===Early years===\nBorn to a working-class family in [[Cambuslang]], Lanarkshire, Scotland, Ure attended [[Rutherglen Academy]] until he was 15 years old. For the first 10 years of his life he lived in a one-bedroom tenement flat in Cambuslang (on the outskirts of Glasgow) with his brother, sister and parents,<ref name=\"mcgrath1\">{{cite news |last=McGrath |first=Nick |title=Midge Ure: My family values |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/sep/22/midge-ure-ultravox-family-values |accessdate=11 February 2013 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=22 September 2012}}</ref> later moving to a new house in nearby [[Eastfield, South Lanarkshire|Eastfield]].<ref>[https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/midge-ure-tells-viewers-love-9596988Midge Ure tells viewers of his love for Cambuslang], Daily Record, 11 January 2017</ref> \n\nAfter leaving school Ure attended Motherwell Technical College and then began to work as an engineer, training at the [[National Engineering Laboratory]] (NEL), in nearby East Kilbride.<ref name=Hanks>{{cite news |last=Hanks |first=Robert |title=Midge Ure: Back in the spotlight |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/midge-ure-back-in-the-spotlight-6144881.html |accessdate=25 July 2012 |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |date=4 June 2005}}</ref> He started playing music in a Glasgow band called Stumble (c.1969 \u2013 c.1971). The band's line-up included lead guitarist Alan Wright, Fraser Spiers on harmonica, Kenny Ireland on bass and Alec Baird on drums.\n\nUre joined Salvation as a guitarist in 1972. The band had been formed in Glasgow in June 1970 by the brothers [[Kevin McGinlay|Kevin]] (vocals) and [[Jim McGinlay]] (bass guitar). Jim McGinlay (born James McGinlay) decided to turn Ure's name backwards to \"Mij\" (Midge) to avoid any confusion caused by two members of the band having the same first name.<ref name=Hanks /> Ure has since presented himself in the music scene as Midge Ure.<ref name=\"Kevin McGinlay Salvation\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kevinmcginlay.com/kevin_early.html |title=Kevin McGinlay Salvation |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226202501/http://www.kevinmcginlay.com/kevin_early.html |archivedate=26 February 2009 }}</ref> The band performed covers as house band in the Glasgow discoth\u00e8que Clouds. The band also comprised [[Billy McIsaac]] on keyboards and [[Kenny Hyslop]] on drums.\n\nIn April 1974, Kevin McGinlay left to pursue a solo career,<ref name=\"Kevin McGinlay Salvation\"/> so Ure assumed vocals in addition to his guitar duties. In November 1974, the band changed its name to [[Slik]], with [[Bay City Rollers]] writers [[Bill Martin (musician)|Bill Martin]] and [[Phil Coulter]] providing songs. In 1975 Ure turned down an offer to be the lead singer of the [[Sex Pistols]], stating that he felt at the time that [[Malcolm McLaren]] had \"his priorities completely wrong!\", a position he later reversed.<ref>\"[http://www.friendsofscotland.gov.uk/scotlandnow/issue-05/arts/midge-ure-interview.html Midge Ure interview]\", Global Friends of Scotland.

In early 1977, Jim McGinlay decided to quit the band, being replaced by [[Russell Webb (musician)|Russell Webb]]. Slik terminated their contract with Martin and Coulter, believing that their boy-band image was hindering their chances of success during the rising [[punk rock]] scene. They changed their name to [[PVC2]] and adopted a more punkish style. Ure's only release with the band under this name was the single \"[[Put You in the Picture]]\".\n\n===Rich Kids===\nBy October 1977, Ure had left PVC2 to join former Sex Pistol [[Glen Matlock]] in [[Rich Kids]]. He moved to London and soon found himself immersed in a scene he had previously only read about in the pages of the ''[[NME]]''.<ref name=FOS>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/rockingscots/pip/archive/|title=BBC \u2013 (none) \u2013 Rocking Scots \u2013 Archive|website=Bbc.co.uk}}</ref> Musical tensions within the band led to Ure's departure. Having acquired a Yamaha CS50 synthesiser, Ure \u2013 alongside bandmate [[Rusty Egan]] \u2013 wanted to integrate the new instrument into the band's sound. With Glen Matlock and Steve New preferring to remain with the traditional guitars and drums approach, the band split.\n\nIn January 2010, [[Rich Kids]] reformed, for one night only, for a benefit concert for [[Steve New]] who was fighting terminal cancer (and died on 24 May 2010).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shapersofthe80s.com/2010/05/24/2010-%E2%9E%A4-rich-kid-steve-new-aka-stella-nova-dies-at-50|title=2010 \u27a4 Rich Kid Steve New (aka Stella Nova) dies at 50|date=24 May 2010|publisher=Shapersofthe80s.com|accessdate=17 June 2013}}</ref> Although it had been over 30 years since they played together, the press reports praised the gig, which included energetic performances of \"Ghosts of Princes in Towers\" and \"Hung on You\". [[Rich Kids]] were joined on stage by [[Mick Jones (The Clash)]] and [[Gary Kemp]]. Ure also played an acoustic set of [[Ultravox]] and [[Visage (band)|Visage]] songs.\n\nIn February 2016, it was announced that Rich Kids would reform for a joint headline show with [[The Professionals (band)|The Professionals]] at London's [[O2 Shepherds Bush Empire]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.withguitars.com/rich-kids-professionals-joint-headline-show-announced-first-time-ever/|title=Rich Kids and The Professionals \u2013 Joint Headline Show Announced For The First Time Ever|date=3 February 2016|website=WithGuitars.com}}</ref>\n\n===Visage===\nIn 1978, Egan and Ure formed [[Visage (band)|Visage]] with lead vocalist [[Steve Strange]], and utilised their new synthesiser when they recorded a cover of the Zager & Evans classic \"[[In The Year 2525]]\" for promotional purposes. The line-up was expanded in 1979 with the addition of [[Magazine (band)|Magazine]] members [[Dave Formula]], [[John McGeoch]] and [[Barry Adamson]], and [[Ultravox]] keyboardist [[Billy Currie]], and the band signed briefly to Radar Records for the release of their first single \"[[Tar (song)|Tar]]\". Egan and Ure also formed the short-lived band [[The Misfits (UK band)|The Misfits]], whose career was curtailed by an approach from [[Thin Lizzy]]. Though Visage's first single was unsuccessful, they signed with [[Polydor Records]] in 1980; their second single, \"[[Fade to Grey (Visage song)|Fade to Grey]]\", became a hit.\n\n===Thin Lizzy===\nUre already knew [[Thin Lizzy]] singer [[Phil Lynott]], and in early 1979 Ure received co-writing credit for \"Get Out of Here\" on Thin Lizzy's album ''[[Black Rose: A Rock Legend|Black Rose]]''. In July 1979 Ure stepped in to help Thin Lizzy complete a US tour following guitarist [[Gary Moore]]'s abrupt departure. Ure also contributed guitar parts to \"Things Ain't Working Out\" and \"Dublin\" for the 1979 Thin Lizzy remix compilation ''[[The Continuing Saga of the Ageing Orphans]]''. Thin Lizzy then toured America and Japan. In 1980, during the second part of this tour, Ure switched to keyboards, and was replaced by [[Dave Flett]] and then [[Snowy White]] as guitarist. At the end of the tour Ure left Thin Lizzy and returned to his primary interest at that time, [[Ultravox]]. Ure continued to collaborate with Lynott, co-writing Lynott's biggest solo hit, \"[[Yellow Pearl (song)|Yellow Pearl]]\".\n\n===Ultravox===\nIn 1979, Ure and [[Billy Currie]] formed a close bond playing together in [[Visage (band)|Visage]]. Rusty Egan persuaded Billy Currie to ask Ure if he was interested in joining a revived Ultravox.  Ultravox had been presumed defunct since guitarist [[Robin Simon]] quit and lead singer [[John Foxx]] had left to pursue a solo career. In April 1979 Ure regrouped the band and assumed duties as singer, songwriter, guitarist and second keyboardist. This second incarnation would become the classic line-up, with Currie (keyboards, violin), [[Chris Cross]] (bass) and [[Warren Cann]] (electronic drums). Although Ure had spent the latter half of 1979 on tour with Thin Lizzy, Ultravox found time late in the year to tour in the USA. During this time the band wrote a number of songs which were included on their first album with Ure.\n\nThe album, ''[[Vienna (album)|Vienna]]'', was recorded in 1980. Although it was the band's fourth album, it was the first with Ure, and the first one to chart, although it was only a minor success on first release. However, when the title track \"[[Vienna (Ultravox song)|Vienna]]\" was released as a single in early 1981 it became a huge hit and spent four weeks at no.2 in the UK singles chart and was the 5th highest selling single in the UK that year. The album itself re-entered the album chart and peaked at no.3. Inspired by the 1949 film ''[[The Third Man]]'', the promo video for \"Vienna\" was directed by [[Russell Mulcahy]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mvdbase.com/video.php?id=28754|title=Ultravox \u2013 Vienna (version 1: concept)|last=Garcia|first=Alex S|accessdate=26 July 2008|work=Music Video Database|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002075852/http://mvdbase.com/video.php?id=28754|archive-date=2 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> utilising cinematic techniques, and became quite influential. In an interview Ure recalled the way that \"music video changed after that. All these things that became video clich\u00e9s \u2013 cropping the top and bottom off the screen, shooting on film as opposed to videotape, making it look like a movie ... we were quite a groundbreaking act for a while.\"<ref name=FOS /> The same year that Ultravox released the ''Vienna'' album, Visage also released their [[Visage (Visage album)|debut album]] which made the UK Top 20 and featured the hit single \"[[Fade to Grey (Visage song)|Fade to Grey]]\" (co-written by Ure and Currie with [[Dramatis|Chris Payne]]), also influential in the direction of the [[New Romantic]] electropop music scene.<ref>Rimmer, Dave. ''New Romantics: The Look'' (2003), Omnibus Press. {{ISBN|0-7119-9396-3}}</ref>\nFor a while between 1979 and 1980, then, Ure was deeply committed to three different bands, all of them quite successful: Ultravox, Visage and Thin Lizzy.\n\n[[File:Midge April84.JPG|thumb|Ultravox (Midge Ure) in concert, April 1984]]\n\nIn 1981, Ultravox recorded their second album with Ure as frontman, ''[[Rage in Eden]]'', which was a Top 5 hit in the UK. After its release Ure and Currie reconvened with Visage to record the band's second album, ''[[The Anvil (album)|The Anvil]]''. Released in early 1982, it was a Top 10 hit; but Ure left the band soon after its release, citing creative differences with frontman Steve Strange. The same year saw Ultravox record and release their third album with Ure, ''[[Quartet (Ultravox album)|Quartet]]'', with production by [[Beatles]] producer [[George Martin]]. The album became their third Top 10 hit and featured four Top 20 singles. This period saw Ure work as a producer for other artists, amongst them [[Steve Harley]], [[Skids (band)|Skids]] and [[Strasse Music Artist|Strasse]], and in 1982 he released his first solo single, a cover of the 1968 [[Tom Rush]] song \"[[No Regrets (Tom Rush song)|No Regrets]]\" (based on the 1975 hit cover version by [[The Walker Brothers]]), which made the UK Top 10.\n\nAfter the live album ''[[Monument (Ultravox album)|Monument]]'' in 1983 Ultravox released their fourth studio album with Ure, ''[[Lament (Ultravox album)|Lament]]'', in 1984. The album was another Top 10 success and contained the Top 3 hit \"[[Dancing with Tears in My Eyes]]\". The band released their first \"greatest hits\" album at the end of the year, featuring all the singles from 1980 onwards. The album peaked at no.2 in the UK and was later certified triple platinum.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Ultravox (albums)|url = http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/18593/ultravox/|website=Officialcharts.com|access-date = 16 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nAfter Ure's successful debut solo album in 1985, the fifth and final Ultravox album with Ure, ''[[U-Vox]]'', was released in 1986. Although another Top 10 hit, the album (and singles) fared less well than their earlier releases.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Ulstravox \u2013 u-vox|url = http://www.officialcharts.com/search/albums/u-vox/|website=Officialcharts.com|access-date = 16 January 2016}}</ref> After the end of the U-Vox Tour Ure left Ultravox. He stated in an Extreme Voice Fanzine 1991: \"The spark kind of went out of it for me, Live Aid and Band Aid had a lot to do with it, I suppose.

Ure stated in a BBC interview in April 2009, \"we are not trying to get our youth back, nor the hair that's fallen off already\".<ref>\"[http://www.indielondon.co.uk/Music-Review/ultravox-announce-uk-dates-for-return-to-eden-tour-2009 Ultravox announce UK dates for Return to Eden tour (2009)]\" ''indieLONDON'', 2008.</ref><ref>Spencer, Kathryn. \"Midge collects another degree\", 27 November 2008, ''[[Daily Express]]''.</ref> After appearing at the Isle of Wight 2009 Festival Ultravox followed up the next year with a second round of the tour.

In November 2013, Ultravox were special guests on a four-date arena tour with [[Simple Minds]].\n\n===Band Aid and charity work===\nIn 1984, Ure co-wrote the [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]] hit, \"[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]\" with [[Bob Geldof]]. Ure was rehearsing with Ultravox for an episode of the [[Channel 4]] music show \"[[The Tube (TV series)|The Tube]]\" when host [[Paula Yates]] handed him the phone. It was her then husband, Geldof, who proceeded, recalls Ure, \"to rant on about the [[Michael Buerk]] BBC news report on the Ethiopian famine\". Geldof provided the initial lyrics, with Ure working the musical theme on a small keyboard in his kitchen. The second half was composed by Ure, with the bridging chorus only assembled in the studio when the artists had gathered. Ure has described the song as not one of the best he has ever written, commenting that \"the momentum the artists gave it in the recording studio is what made it\".<ref>Crichton, Torcuil. \"Whatever Happened To Midge Ure?\" 25 November 2007, ''[[Sunday Herald]]''</ref>\n\nAt the studio recording Ure took on the production duties for the song. Although [[Trevor Horn]] had been approached to undertake this role, he needed more time to fulfil other obligations than was available.<ref>Hunt, Dennis. \"Pop Music Ure, The Elf Behind 'Christmas'\", 28 April 1985, ''[[LA Times]]'', p.63.</ref> Ure stepped into the breach, with Horn providing his studio, remixing the track and producing the 12\" version.

{{post-nominals|country=GBR|OBE}} (born 10 October 1953) better known as '''Midge Ure''', is a Scottish musician, singer-songwriter and producer. His stage name, Midge, is a [[phonetic reversal]] of Jim, the [[diminutive]] form of his actual name.\n\nUre enjoyed particular success in the 1970s and '80s in bands including [[Slik]], [[Thin Lizzy]], [[Rich Kids]] and [[Visage (band)|Visage]], and most notably as frontman of [[Ultravox]]. In 1984, Ure co-wrote and produced the charity single \"[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]\", which has sold 3.7 million copies in the UK. The song is the second highest selling single in UK chart history.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/nov/04/uk-million-selling-singles-full-list |title=UK's million-selling singles: the full list |last=Sedghi |first= Ami |newspaper=The Guardian |location= London |date=4 November 2012 |accessdate=20 April 2013}}</ref> Ure co-organised [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]], [[Live Aid]] and [[Live 8]] with [[Bob Geldof]]. He acts as a trustee for the charity and also serves as an ambassador for [[Save the Children]].\n\nUre is the producer and writer of several other [[synthpop]]/[[new wave music|new wave]] hit singles of the 1980s, including \"[[Fade to Grey (Visage song)|Fade to Grey]]\" (1980) by Visage and the Ultravox signature songs \"[[Vienna (Ultravox song)|Vienna]]\" (1980) and \"[[Dancing with Tears in My Eyes]]\" (1984).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4078580.stm |title=Midge Ure: Music's quiet man |work=[[BBC News]] |location= London |date=10 June 2005 |accessdate=12 September 2016}}</ref> Ure achieved his first UK top 10 solo hit in 1982 with \"[[No Regrets (Tom Rush song)|No Regrets]]\". In 1985, his solo debut album ''[[The Gift (Midge Ure album)|The Gift]]'' reached number two in the [[UK Albums Chart]] and yielded the UK number one single, \"[[If I Was]]\". Ure also co-wrote [[Phil Lynott]]'s \"[[Yellow Pearl (song)|Yellow Pearl]]\", which served as the theme of ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' for much of the 1980s.\n\n==Career==\n===Early years===\nBorn to a working-class family in [[Cambuslang]], Lanarkshire, Scotland, Ure attended [[Rutherglen Academy]] until he was 15 years old. For the first 10 years of his life he lived in a one-bedroom tenement flat in Cambuslang (on the outskirts of Glasgow) with his brother, sister and parents,<ref name=\"mcgrath1\">{{cite news |last=McGrath |first=Nick |title=Midge Ure: My family values |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/sep/22/midge-ure-ultravox-family-values |accessdate=11 February 2013 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=22 September 2012}}</ref> later moving to a new house in nearby [[Eastfield, South Lanarkshire|Eastfield]].<ref>[https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/midge-ure-tells-viewers-love-9596988Midge Ure tells viewers of his love for Cambuslang], Daily Record, 11 January 2017</ref> \n\nAfter leaving school Ure attended Motherwell Technical College and then began to work as an engineer, training at the [[National Engineering Laboratory]] (NEL), in nearby East Kilbride.<ref name=Hanks>{{cite news |last=Hanks |first=Robert |title=Midge Ure: Back in the spotlight |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/midge-ure-back-in-the-spotlight-6144881.html |accessdate=25 July 2012 |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |date=4 June 2005}}</ref> He started playing music in a Glasgow band called Stumble (c.1969 \u2013 c.1971). The band's line-up included lead guitarist Alan Wright, Fraser Spiers on harmonica, Kenny Ireland on bass and Alec Baird on drums.\n\nUre joined Salvation as a guitarist in 1972. The band had been formed in Glasgow in June 1970 by the brothers [[Kevin McGinlay|Kevin]] (vocals) and [[Jim McGinlay]] (bass guitar). Jim McGinlay (born James McGinlay) decided to turn Ure's name backwards to \"Mij\" (Midge) to avoid any confusion caused by two members of the band having the same first name.<ref name=Hanks /> Ure has since presented himself in the music scene as Midge Ure.<ref name=\"Kevin McGinlay Salvation\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kevinmcginlay.com/kevin_early.html |title=Kevin McGinlay Salvation |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226202501/http://www.kevinmcginlay.com/kevin_early.html |archivedate=26 February 2009 }}</ref> The band performed covers as house band in the Glasgow discoth\u00e8que Clouds. The band also comprised [[Billy McIsaac]] on keyboards and [[Kenny Hyslop]] on drums.\n\nIn April 1974, Kevin McGinlay left to pursue a solo career,<ref name=\"Kevin McGinlay Salvation\"/> so Ure assumed vocals in addition to his guitar duties. In November 1974, the band changed its name to [[Slik]], with [[Bay City Rollers]] writers [[Bill Martin (musician)|Bill Martin]] and [[Phil Coulter]] providing songs. In 1975 Ure turned down an offer to be the lead singer of the [[Sex Pistols]], stating that he felt at the time that [[Malcolm McLaren]] had \"his priorities completely wrong!\", a position he later reversed.<ref>\"[http://www.friendsofscotland.gov.uk/scotlandnow/issue-05/arts/midge-ure-interview.html Midge Ure interview]\", Global Friends of Scotland.

In early 1977, Jim McGinlay decided to quit the band, being replaced by [[Russell Webb (musician)|Russell Webb]]. Slik terminated their contract with Martin and Coulter, believing that their boy-band image was hindering their chances of success during the rising [[punk rock]] scene. They changed their name to [[PVC2]] and adopted a more punkish style. Ure's only release with the band under this name was the single \"[[Put You in the Picture]]\".\n\n===Rich Kids===\nBy October 1977, Ure had left PVC2 to join former Sex Pistol [[Glen Matlock]] in [[Rich Kids]]. He moved to London and soon found himself immersed in a scene he had previously only read about in the pages of the ''[[NME]]''.<ref name=FOS>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/rockingscots/pip/archive/|title=BBC - (none) - Rocking Scots - Archive|website=Bbc.co.uk}}</ref> Musical tensions within the band led to Ure's departure. Having acquired a Yamaha CS50 synthesiser, Ure \u2013 alongside bandmate [[Rusty Egan]] \u2013 wanted to integrate the new instrument into the band's sound. With Glen Matlock and Steve New preferring to remain with the traditional guitars and drums approach, the band split.\n\nIn January 2010, [[Rich Kids]] reformed, for one night only, for a benefit concert for [[Steve New]] who was fighting terminal cancer (and died on 24 May 2010).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shapersofthe80s.com/2010/05/24/2010-%E2%9E%A4-rich-kid-steve-new-aka-stella-nova-dies-at-50|title=2010 \u27a4 Rich Kid Steve New (aka Stella Nova) dies at 50|date=24 May 2010|publisher=Shapersofthe80s.com|accessdate=17 June 2013}}</ref> Although it had been over 30 years since they played together, the press reports praised the gig, which included energetic performances of \"Ghosts of Princes in Towers\" and \"Hung on You\". [[Rich Kids]] were joined on stage by [[Mick Jones (The Clash)]] and [[Gary Kemp]]. Ure also played an acoustic set of [[Ultravox]] and [[Visage (band)|Visage]] songs.\n\nIn February 2016, it was announced that Rich Kids would reform for a joint headline show with [[The Professionals (band)|The Professionals]] at London's [[O2 Shepherds Bush Empire]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.withguitars.com/rich-kids-professionals-joint-headline-show-announced-first-time-ever/|title=Rich Kids and The Professionals \u2013 Joint Headline Show Announced For The First Time Ever|date=3 February 2016|website=WithGuitars.com}}</ref>\n\n===Visage===\nIn 1978, Egan and Ure formed [[Visage (band)|Visage]] with lead vocalist [[Steve Strange]], and utilised their new synthesiser when they recorded a cover of the Zager & Evans classic \"[[In The Year 2525]]\" for promotional purposes. The line-up was expanded in 1979 with the addition of [[Magazine (band)|Magazine]] members [[Dave Formula]], [[John McGeoch]] and [[Barry Adamson]], and [[Ultravox]] keyboardist [[Billy Currie]], and the band signed briefly to Radar Records for the release of their first single \"[[Tar (song)|Tar]]\". Egan and Ure also formed the short-lived band [[The Misfits (UK band)|The Misfits]], whose career was curtailed by an approach from [[Thin Lizzy]]. Though Visage's first single was unsuccessful, they signed with [[Polydor Records]] in 1980; their second single, \"[[Fade to Grey (Visage song)|Fade to Grey]]\", became a hit.\n\n===Thin Lizzy===\nUre already knew [[Thin Lizzy]] singer [[Phil Lynott]], and in early 1979 Ure received co-writing credit for \"Get Out of Here\" on Thin Lizzy's album ''[[Black Rose: A Rock Legend|Black Rose]]''. In July 1979 Ure stepped in to help Thin Lizzy complete a US tour following guitarist [[Gary Moore]]'s abrupt departure. Ure also contributed guitar parts to \"Things Ain't Working Out\" and \"Dublin\" for the 1979 Thin Lizzy remix compilation ''[[The Continuing Saga of the Ageing Orphans]]''. Thin Lizzy then toured America and Japan. In 1980, during the second part of this tour, Ure switched to keyboards, and was replaced by [[Dave Flett]] and then [[Snowy White]] as guitarist. At the end of the tour Ure left Thin Lizzy and returned to his primary interest at that time, [[Ultravox]]. Ure continued to collaborate with Lynott, co-writing Lynott's biggest solo hit, \"[[Yellow Pearl (song)|Yellow Pearl]]\".\n\n===Ultravox===\nIn 1979, Ure and [[Billy Currie]] formed a close bond playing together in [[Visage (band)|Visage]]. Rusty Egan persuaded Billy Currie to ask Ure if he was interested in joining a revived Ultravox.  Ultravox had been presumed defunct since guitarist [[Robin Simon]] quit and lead singer [[John Foxx]] had left to pursue a solo career. In April 1979 Ure regrouped the band and assumed duties as singer, songwriter, guitarist and second keyboardist. This second incarnation would become the classic line-up, with Currie (keyboards, violin), [[Chris Cross]] (bass) and [[Warren Cann]] (electronic drums). Although Ure had spent the latter half of 1979 on tour with Thin Lizzy, Ultravox found time late in the year to tour in the USA. During this time the band wrote a number of songs which were included on their first album with Ure.\n\nThe album, ''[[Vienna (album)|Vienna]]'', was recorded in 1980. Although it was the band's fourth album, it was the first with Ure, and the first one to chart, although it was only a minor success on first release. However, when the title track \"[[Vienna (Ultravox song)|Vienna]]\" was released as a single in early 1981 it became a huge hit and spent four weeks at no.2 in the UK singles chart and was the 5th highest selling single in the UK that year. The album itself re-entered the album chart and peaked at no.3. Inspired by the 1949 film ''[[The Third Man]]'', the promo video for \"Vienna\" was directed by [[Russell Mulcahy]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mvdbase.com/video.php?id=28754|title=Ultravox \u2013 Vienna (version 1: concept)|last=Garcia|first=Alex S|accessdate=26 July 2008|work=Music Video Database|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002075852/http://mvdbase.com/video.php?id=28754|archive-date=2 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> utilising cinematic techniques, and became quite influential. In an interview Ure recalled the way that \"music video changed after that. All these things that became video clich\u00e9s \u2013 cropping the top and bottom off the screen, shooting on film as opposed to videotape, making it look like a movie ... we were quite a groundbreaking act for a while.\"<ref name=FOS /> The same year that Ultravox released the ''Vienna'' album, Visage also released their [[Visage (Visage album)|debut album]] which made the UK Top 20 and featured the hit single \"[[Fade to Grey (Visage song)|Fade to Grey]]\" (co-written by Ure and Currie with [[Dramatis|Chris Payne]]), also influential in the direction of the [[New Romantic]] electropop music scene.<ref>Rimmer, Dave. ''New Romantics: The Look'' (2003), Omnibus Press. {{ISBN|0-7119-9396-3}}</ref>\nFor a while between 1979 and 1980, then, Ure was deeply committed to three different bands, all of them quite successful: Ultravox, Visage and Thin Lizzy.\n\n[[File:Midge April84.JPG|thumb|Ultravox (Midge Ure) in concert, April 1984]]\n\nIn 1981, Ultravox recorded their second album with Ure as frontman, ''[[Rage in Eden]]'', which was a Top 5 hit in the UK. After its release Ure and Currie reconvened with Visage to record the band's second album, ''[[The Anvil (album)|The Anvil]]''. Released in early 1982, it was a Top 10 hit; but Ure left the band soon after its release, citing creative differences with frontman Steve Strange. The same year saw Ultravox record and release their third album with Ure, ''[[Quartet (Ultravox album)|Quartet]]'', with production by [[Beatles]] producer [[George Martin]]. The album became their third Top 10 hit and featured four Top 20 singles. This period saw Ure work as a producer for other artists, amongst them [[Steve Harley]], [[Skids (band)|Skids]] and [[Strasse Music Artist|Strasse]], and in 1982 he released his first solo single, a cover of the 1968 [[Tom Rush]] song \"[[No Regrets (Tom Rush song)|No Regrets]]\" (based on the 1975 hit cover version by [[The Walker Brothers]]), which made the UK Top 10.\n\nAfter the live album ''[[Monument (Ultravox album)|Monument]]'' in 1983 Ultravox released their fourth studio album with Ure, ''[[Lament (Ultravox album)|Lament]]'', in 1984. The album was another Top 10 success and contained the Top 3 hit \"[[Dancing with Tears in My Eyes]]\". The band released their first \"greatest hits\" album at the end of the year, featuring all the singles from 1980 onwards. The album peaked at no.2 in the UK and was later certified triple platinum.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Ultravox (albums)|url = http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/18593/ultravox/|website=Officialcharts.com|access-date = 16 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nAfter Ure's successful debut solo album in 1985, the fifth and final Ultravox album with Ure, ''[[U-Vox]]'', was released in 1986. Although another Top 10 hit, the album (and singles) fared less well than their earlier releases.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Ulstravox \u2013 u-vox|url = http://www.officialcharts.com/search/albums/u-vox/|website=Officialcharts.com|access-date = 16 January 2016}}</ref> After the end of the U-Vox Tour Ure left Ultravox. He stated in an Extreme Voice Fanzine 1991: \"The spark kind of went out of it for me, Live Aid and Band Aid had a lot to do with it, I suppose. We had a long break from each other and when we came back together we were all working in different directions\".<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.ultravox.org.uk/cgi-bin/ImageFolio43/imageFolio.cgi?direct=Fanzines%2FExtreme_Voice |title=Archived copy |access-date=3 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190806084958/http://www.ultravox.org.uk/cgi-bin/ImageFolio43/imageFolio.cgi?direct=Fanzines%2FExtreme_Voice |archive-date=6 August 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn April 2009, Ure and the other members (Cann, Currie and Cross) reformed Ultravox for the Return to Eden tour to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the ''Vienna'' album, and in their own words, the \"anniversary of their classic line-up\". Ure stated in a BBC interview in April 2009, \"we are not trying to get our youth back, nor the hair that's fallen off already\".<ref>\"[http://www.indielondon.co.uk/Music-Review/ultravox-announce-uk-dates-for-return-to-eden-tour-2009 Ultravox announce UK dates for Return to Eden tour (2009)]\" ''indieLONDON'', 2008.</ref><ref>Spencer, Kathryn. \"Midge collects another degree\", 27 November 2008, ''[[Daily Express]]''.</ref> After appearing at the Isle of Wight 2009 Festival Ultravox followed up the next year with a second round of the tour. In late 2010, Ultravox started working on their sixth album fronted by Ure. This album, titled ''[[Brilliant (album)|Brilliant]]'', was released in May 2012.<ref>{{cite web|last=Eames|first=Tom|title=Ultravox release first new album with Midge Ure in 26 years|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a384644/ultravox-release-first-new-album-with-midge-ure-in-26-years.html|work=Digital Spy|accessdate=25 July 2012|date=31 May 2012}}</ref> Following this release the band embarked on the 'Brilliant Tour' performing shows in the UK and Europe in late 2012. In November 2013, Ultravox were special guests on a four-date arena tour with [[Simple Minds]].\n\n===Band Aid and charity work===\nIn 1984, Ure co-wrote the [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]] hit, \"[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]\" with [[Bob Geldof]]. Ure was rehearsing with Ultravox for an episode of the [[Channel 4]] music show \"[[The Tube (TV series)|The Tube]]\" when host [[Paula Yates]] handed him the phone. It was her then husband, Geldof, who proceeded, recalls Ure, \"to rant on about the [[Michael Buerk]] BBC news report on the Ethiopian famine\". Geldof provided the initial lyrics, with Ure working the musical theme on a small keyboard in his kitchen.

Its current MP is [[Carolyn Bennett]]. Prior to the [[42nd Canadian federal election|2015 election]], the riding was known as '''St. Paul's'''.<ref>http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&Mode=1&DocId=6654879&File=4</ref>\n\nThe small but densely populated [[electoral district (Canada)|riding]] covers the area to the north and northeast of [[Downtown Toronto|Downtown]] [[Toronto]] (often called \"Midtown\" Toronto). In the past, it had been considered a [[bellwether]] riding, having been represented by only three [[Official Opposition|opposition]] MPs. However, like most Toronto-based ridings, the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] have dominated recent elections. Since the Liberals won all but one seat in Ontario in their [[1993 Canadian federal election|1993 landslide]], they have won all but one election in St. Paul's by 10,000 votes or more.\n\nAs of 2015, it includes the southern two-thirds of the wealthy Toronto neighbourhood of [[Forest Hill, Toronto|Forest Hill]], plus the neighbourhoods of [[Deer Park, Toronto|Deer Park]], [[Davisville Village]],  [[Chaplin Estates, Toronto|Chaplin Estates]], [[South Hill, Toronto|South Hill]], [[Humewood-Cedarvale]], the southern two-thirds of [[Fairbank, Toronto|Fairbank]], and the northern half of [[Summerhill, Toronto|Summerhill]].\n==Demographics==\n:''According to the [[Canada 2006 Census]]''\n\n'''Ethnic groups:''' 76.08% White, 5.31% Black, 4.04% Filipino, 3.73% Chinese, 2.85% Latin

Centre]], [[Toronto Northeast]], [[Toronto South]] and [[Toronto West Centre]] [[Electoral district (Canada)|ridings]].\n\nIt consisted initially of the central part of the City of Toronto (\"Downtown Toronto\")  It was bounded on the south by Toronto Bay, on the east by [[Sherbourne Street, Toronto|Sherbourne Street]] and on the north and west by a line drawn from Sherbourne Street west along Bloor Street, north along Yonge Street, northwest along the belt line railway, south and west along the western limit of the city, south along Dunvegan Road, east along St. Clair Avenue, south along Poplar Plains Road, west along Dupont Street, south along St. George and Beverley Streets, east along Queen Street, south along John Street.\n\nIn 1947, it was redefined to consist of the part of the city of Toronto bounded on the south by Toronto Bay, on the east by a line drawn from the Bay north along Sherbourne Street, west along Bloor Street East and north along Yonge Street, on the north by the south boundary of Ward Nine of the city of Toronto, and on the west by a line drawn from the Bay north on John Street, west along Queen Street West, north on Beverley Street and along St. George Street, east along Dupont Street, north along [[Davenport Road]] and Poplar Plains Road, west along St. Clair Avenue West, north along Dunvegan Road, east and north along the city limit to the southern boundary of Ward Nine.\n\nIn 1966, the southern part of the riding, what would be considered to be \"Downtown Toronto\" was removed from the electoral district (added to Rosedale electoral district) and the riding was shifted northward redefined to consist of the part of [[Metropolitan Toronto]] bounded by a line drawn from Bloor Street, north along Yonge Street, northwest along the Canadian National Railway line, north along Elmsthorpe Avenue, west along Eglinton Avenue, north along Castlewood Road, west along Briar Hill Avenue, south along Old Park Road and Glen Cedar Road, southeast along Claxton Boulevard, south along Bathurst Street and east along Bloor Street to Yonge Street.\n\nIn 1987, it was redefined to consist of the part of the cities of Toronto and York bounded by a line drawn from the Canadian Pacific Railway line north along Ossington Avenue, east along Davenport Road, north along Winona Drive, west along Eglinton Avenue West, north and east along the eastern limit of the City of York, east and north along the northern limit of the City of Toronto, south along Yonge Street and westerly along the CPR line to Ossington Avenue (removing lands between the CPR lands and Bloor Street).\n\nIn 1996, it was redefined to consist of the part of the cities of Toronto and York bounded by a line drawn from the Canadian Pacific Railway north along Ossington Avenue, east along Davenport Road, north along Winona Drive, west along Eglinton Avenue West, north along the eastern limit of the City of York, east along the northern limit of the City of Toronto, south along Bathurst Street, southeast along the Belt Line (formerly the Canadian National Railway), east along Eglinton Avenue West, north along Yonge Street, east along Broadway Avenue, south and east along the eastern limit of the City of Toronto, west along the south side of the Mount Pleasant Cemetery, south along the ravine situated east of Avoca Avenue, west along Rosehill Avenue, south and east along the west side of the Rosehill Reservoir, west along Woodlawn Avenue East, south along Yonge Street, and west along the Canadian Pacific Railway to Ossington Avenue.\n\nIn 2003, it was redefined to consist of the part of the City of Toronto bounded by a line drawn from the Canadian Pacific Railway north along Ossington Avenue, east along Davenport Road, north along Winona Drive, west along Holland Park Avenue, north along Oakwood Avenue, west along Rogers Road, north along Dufferin Street, east along Eglinton Avenue West, north along Yonge Street, east along Broadway Avenue, south along the former eastern limit of the City of Toronto, west along the south side of the Mount Pleasant Cemetery, southeast along the Don River Tributary situated east of Avoca Avenue, west along Rosehill Avenue, south along the west side of the Rosehill Reservoir, west along Jackes Avenue, south along Yonge Street and west along the Canadian Pacific Railway to Ossington Avenue.\n\nIn the [[Canadian federal electoral redistribution, 2012|2012 electoral redistribution]], St. Paul's lost territory to [[Don Valley West]], gained a small fraction from [[Davenport (electoral district)|Davenport]] and was renamed Toronto\u2014St. Paul's.\n\n=== Churches named for St Paul in the electoral district ===\n\nFrom its creation until 1966, the electoral district included two prominent churches named for [[St Paul]] the apostle: [[St. Paul's, Bloor Street]] at 227 Bloor Street East, which is the largest Anglican church in Toronto by [[seating capacity]]; and [[St. Paul's-Avenue Road United Church]] at Avenue Road and Webster Avenue, which was the church of many of Toronto's [[elite]]. The electoral district ceased to include 227 Bloor Street East after a redefinition of the district's boundaries in 1966. In 1980, the congregation at St. Paul's-Avenue Road United Church moved to 427 Bloor Street West during a church merger creating [[Trinity-St. Paul's United Church]].

Its current MP is [[Carolyn Bennett]]. Prior to the [[42nd Canadian federal election|2015 election]], the riding was known as '''St. Paul's'''.<ref>http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&Mode=1&DocId=6654879&File=4</ref>\n\nThe small but densely populated [[electoral district (Canada)|riding]] covers the area to the north and northeast of [[Downtown Toronto|Downtown]] [[Toronto]] (often called \"Midtown\" Toronto). In the past, it had been considered a [[bellwether]] riding, having been represented by only three [[Official Opposition|opposition]] MPs. However, like most Toronto-based ridings, the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] have dominated recent elections. Since the Liberals won all but one seat in Ontario in their [[1993 Canadian federal election|1993 landslide]], they have won all but one election in St. Paul's by 10,000 votes or more.\n\nAs of 2015, it includes the southern two-thirds of the wealthy Toronto neighbourhood of [[Forest Hill, Toronto|Forest Hill]], plus the neighbourhoods of [[Deer Park, Toronto|Deer Park]], [[Davisville Village]],  [[Chaplin Estates, Toronto|Chaplin Estates]], [[South Hill, Toronto|South Hill]], [[Humewood-Cedarvale]], the southern two-thirds of [[Fairbank, Toronto|Fairbank]], and the northern half of

Centre]], [[Toronto Northeast]], [[Toronto South]] and [[Toronto West Centre]] [[Electoral district (Canada)|ridings]].\n\nIt consisted initially of the central part of the City of Toronto (\"Downtown Toronto\")  It was bounded on the south by Toronto Bay, on the east by [[Sherbourne Street, Toronto|Sherbourne Street]] and on the north and west by a line drawn from Sherbourne Street west along Bloor Street, north along Yonge Street, northwest along the belt line railway, south and west along the western limit of the city, south along Dunvegan Road, east along St. Clair Avenue, south along Poplar Plains Road, west along Dupont Street, south along St. George and Beverley Streets, east along Queen Street, south along John Street.\n\nIn 1947, it was redefined to consist of the part of the city of Toronto bounded on the south by Toronto Bay, on the east by a line drawn from the Bay north along Sherbourne Street, west along Bloor Street East and north along Yonge Street, on the north by the south boundary of Ward Nine of the city of Toronto, and on the west by a line drawn from the Bay north on John Street, west along Queen Street West, north on Beverley Street and along St. George Street, east along Dupont Street, north along [[Davenport Road]] and Poplar Plains Road, west along St. Clair Avenue West, north along Dunvegan Road, east and north along the city limit to the southern boundary of Ward Nine.\n\nIn 1966, the southern part of the riding, what would be considered to be \"Downtown Toronto\" was removed from the electoral district (added to Rosedale electoral district) and the riding was shifted northward redefined to consist of the part of [[Metropolitan Toronto]] bounded by a line drawn from Bloor Street, north along Yonge Street, northwest along the Canadian National Railway line, north along Elmsthorpe Avenue, west along Eglinton Avenue, north along Castlewood Road, west along Briar Hill Avenue, south along Old Park Road and Glen Cedar Road, southeast along Claxton Boulevard, south along Bathurst Street and east along Bloor Street to Yonge Street.\n\nIn 1987, it was redefined to consist of the part of the cities of Toronto and York bounded by a line drawn from the Canadian Pacific Railway line north along Ossington Avenue, east along Davenport Road, north along Winona Drive, west along Eglinton Avenue West, north and east along the eastern limit of the City of York, east and north along the northern limit of the City of Toronto, south along Yonge Street and westerly along the CPR line to Ossington Avenue (removing lands between the CPR lands and Bloor Street).\n\nIn 1996, it was redefined to consist of the part of the cities of Toronto and York bounded by a line drawn from the Canadian Pacific Railway north along Ossington Avenue, east along Davenport Road, north along Winona Drive, west along Eglinton Avenue West, north along the eastern limit of the City of York, east along the northern limit of the City of Toronto, south along Bathurst Street, southeast along the Belt Line (formerly the Canadian National Railway), east along Eglinton Avenue West, north along Yonge Street, east along Broadway Avenue, south and east along the eastern limit of the City of Toronto, west along the south side of the Mount Pleasant Cemetery, south along the ravine situated east of Avoca Avenue, west along Rosehill Avenue, south and east along the west side of the Rosehill Reservoir, west along Woodlawn Avenue East, south along Yonge Street, and west along the Canadian Pacific Railway to Ossington Avenue.\n\nIn 2003, it was redefined to consist of the part of the City of Toronto bounded by a line drawn from the Canadian Pacific Railway north along Ossington Avenue, east along Davenport Road, north along Winona Drive, west along Holland Park Avenue, north along Oakwood Avenue, west along Rogers Road, north along Dufferin Street, east along Eglinton Avenue West, north along Yonge Street, east along Broadway Avenue, south along the former eastern limit of the City of Toronto, west along the south side of the Mount Pleasant Cemetery, southeast along the Don River Tributary situated east of Avoca Avenue, west along Rosehill Avenue, south along the west side of the Rosehill Reservoir, west along Jackes Avenue, south along Yonge Street and west along the Canadian Pacific Railway to Ossington Avenue.\n\nIn the [[Canadian federal electoral redistribution, 2012|2012 electoral redistribution]], St. Paul's lost territory to [[Don Valley West]], gained a small fraction from [[Davenport (electoral district)|Davenport]] and was renamed Toronto\u2014St. Paul's.\n\n=== Churches named for St Paul in the electoral district ===\n\nFrom its creation until 1966, the electoral district included two prominent churches named for [[St Paul]] the apostle: [[St. Paul's, Bloor Street]] at 227 Bloor Street East, which is the largest Anglican church in Toronto by [[seating capacity]]; and [[St. Paul's-Avenue Road United Church]] at Avenue Road and Webster Avenue, which was the church of many of Toronto's [[elite]]. The electoral district ceased to include 227 Bloor Street East after a redefinition of the district's boundaries in 1966. In 1980, the congregation at St. Paul's-Avenue Road United Church moved to 427 Bloor Street West during a church merger creating [[Trinity-St. Paul's United Church]].

She is particularly known for her work in period dramas, and is often drawn to portraying angst-ridden women. Winslet is the recipient of [[List of awards and nominations received by Kate Winslet|various accolades]], including three [[British Academy Film Awards]], and is among the few performers to have won [[List of people who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Awards#Three competitive awards|Academy, Emmy, and Grammy Awards]].\n\nBorn in [[Reading, Berkshire]], Winslet studied drama at the [[Redroofs Theatre School]]. Her first screen appearance, at the age of 15, was in the British television series ''[[Dark Season]]'' (1991). She made her film debut playing a teenage murderess in ''[[Heavenly Creatures]]'' (1994), and received her first [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role|BAFTA Award]] for playing [[Marianne Dashwood]] in ''[[Sense and Sensibility (film)|Sense and Sensibility]]'' (1995). Global stardom followed soon after with her leading role in the epic romance ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' (1997). It was the [[List of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film]] of all time to that point, after which she eschewed parts in blockbusters in favour of critically acclaimed period pieces, including ''[[Quills]]'' (2000) and ''[[Iris (2001 film)|Iris]]'' (2001), which were not widely seen.\n\nThe science fiction romance ''[[Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind]]'' (2004), in which Winslet was cast against [[typecasting (acting)|type]] in a contemporary setting, proved to be a turning point in her career, and she gained further recognition for her performances in ''[[Finding Neverland (film)|Finding Neverland]]'' (2004), ''[[Little Children (film)|Little Children]]'' (2006), ''[[Revolutionary Road (film)|Revolutionary Road]]'' (2008), and ''[[The Reader (2008 film)|The Reader]]'' (2008). For playing a former Nazi camp guard in the last of these, she won the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role|BAFTA Award]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Academy Award]] for Best Actress. In the 2010s, Winslet played a single mother in 1930s America in the miniseries ''[[Mildred Pierce (miniseries)|Mildred Pierce]]'' (2011), joined the [[The Divergent Series|''Divergent'' film series]], and portrayed [[Joanna Hoffman]] in ''[[Steve Jobs (film)|Steve Jobs]]'' (2015). She won a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie|Primetime Emmy Award]] for the first of these and a third BAFTA Award for the lattermost.\n\nFor her narration of a short story in the audiobook ''Listen to the Storyteller'' (1999), Winslet won a [[Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for Children|Grammy Award]]. She performed the song \"[[What If (Kate Winslet song)|What If]]\" for the soundtrack of her film ''[[Christmas Carol: The Movie]]'' (2001). A co-founder of the charity [[Golden Hat Foundation]], which aims to create [[autism awareness]], she has written a book on the topic, ''The Golden Hat: Talking Back to Autism'' (2010). ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named her one of the [[Time 100|100 most influential people in the world]] in 2009, and in 2012, she was appointed [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE). Divorced from the film directors [[Jim Threapleton]] and [[Sam Mendes]], Winslet has been married to the businessman Edward Abel Smith since 2012.

She is particularly known for her work in period dramas, and is often drawn to portraying angst-ridden women. Winslet is the recipient of [[List of awards and nominations received by Kate Winslet|various accolades]], including three [[British Academy Film Awards]], and is among the few performers to have won [[List of people who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Awards#Three competitive awards|Academy, Emmy, and Grammy Awards]].\n\nBorn in [[Reading, Berkshire]], Winslet studied drama at the [[Redroofs Theatre School]]. Her first screen appearance, at the age of 15, was in the British television series ''[[Dark Season]]'' (1991). She made her film debut playing a teenage murderess in ''[[Heavenly Creatures]]'' (1994), and received her first [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role|BAFTA Award]] for playing [[Marianne Dashwood]] in ''[[Sense and Sensibility (film)|Sense and Sensibility]]'' (1995). Global stardom followed soon after with her leading role in the epic romance ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' (1997). It was the [[List of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film]] of all time to that point, after which she eschewed parts in blockbusters in favour of critically acclaimed period pieces, including ''[[Quills]]'' (2000) and ''[[Iris (2001 film)|Iris]]'' (2001), which were not widely seen.\n\nThe science fiction romance ''[[Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind]]'' (2004), in which Winslet was cast against [[typecasting (acting)|type]] in a contemporary setting, proved to be a turning point in her career, and she gained further recognition for her performances in ''[[Finding Neverland (film)|Finding Neverland]]'' (2004), ''[[Little Children (film)|Little Children]]'' (2006), ''[[Revolutionary Road (film)|Revolutionary Road]]'' (2008), and ''[[The Reader (2008 film)|The Reader]]'' (2008). For playing a former Nazi camp guard in the last of these, she won the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role|BAFTA Award]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Academy Award]] for Best Actress. In the 2010s, Winslet played a single mother in 1930s America in the miniseries ''[[Mildred Pierce (miniseries)|Mildred Pierce]]'' (2011), joined the [[The Divergent Series|''Divergent'' film series]], and portrayed [[Joanna Hoffman]] in ''[[Steve Jobs (film)|Steve Jobs]]'' (2015). She won a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie|Primetime Emmy Award]] for the first of these and a third BAFTA Award for the lattermost.\n\nFor her narration of a short story in the audiobook ''Listen to the Storyteller'' (1999), Winslet won a [[Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for Children|Grammy Award]]. She performed the song \"[[What If (Kate Winslet song)|What If]]\" for the soundtrack of her film ''[[Christmas Carol: The Movie]]'' (2001). A co-founder of the charity [[Golden Hat Foundation]], which aims to create [[autism awareness]], she has written a book on the topic, ''The Golden Hat: Talking Back to Autism'' (2010). ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named her one of the [[Time 100|100 most influential people in the world]] in 2009, and in 2012, she was appointed [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE). Divorced from the film directors [[Jim Threapleton]] and [[Sam Mendes]], Winslet has been married to the businessman Edward Abel Smith since 2012. She has a child from each marriage.\n\n== Early life and initial stage and television roles ==\n\nKate Winslet was born on 5 October 1975 in [[Reading, Berkshire]], England, to Sally Anne ([[n\u00e9e]] Bridges) and Roger John Winslet.<ref name=biography.com>{{cite web |url = http://www.biography.com/people/kate-winslet-9534599 |title = Kate Winslet Biography: Film Actress, Television Actress (1975\u2013) |publisher = [[Biography.com]] ([[FYI (American TV channel)|FYI]]/[[A&E Networks]]) |accessdate = 7 July 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160717230735/http://www.biography.com/people/kate-winslet-9534599 |archivedate = 17 July 2016 |df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first = Nick |last = Barratt |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2005/12/05/lnickbarratt05.xml |title = Family detective: Kate Winslet |work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] |date = 5 December 2005 |location = London |archivedate = 3 March 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080303210601/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=%2Farts%2F2005%2F12%2F05%2Flnickbarratt05.xml |url-status=dead |df = }}</ref> She is of British ancestry, and has Irish paternal ancestry and Swedish maternal ancestry.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.irishcentral.com/roots/genealogy/kate-winslet-irish-roots | title=Kate Winslet discovers her Irish roots | website=Irish Central | date=6 August 2019 | accessdate=12 August 2019 | quote=Kate Winslet can trace her roots back to Dublin.

Following the closure of the United hub, [[Continental Airlines]] (which at the time was a separate carrier and lacked a Midwest hub) responded by adding capacity to Cleveland, as did [[US Airways|USAir]], which was the dominant carrier at the airport from 1987 until the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite news |title=US Air Wants Mini-Hub in Cleveland|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0MpRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4G0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=4135%2C6758109|newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=February 23, 1987|accessdate=July 5, 2012}}</ref>  While USAir soon reduced its schedule from Cleveland, Continental substantially increased its hub capacity, becoming the airport's largest tenant and eventually accounting for upwards of 60 percent of passenger traffic. Continental and the airport both made substantial operational and capital investments in the airport's infrastructure.  In 1992, the airport completed a $50 million renovation of Concourse C, which housed all of Continental's flights.  The renovation included the installation of a continuous skylight, a Continental President's Club lounge, and a new Baggage Claim area.<ref>{{cite web|title=Continental Airlines Concourse C|url=http://www.rpmadison.com/id54_continental_airlines___concourse_c.htm|publisher=Robert P.

It was also the first airport to employ a two-level terminal design separating arrivals from departures.  The airport was named after its founder, former [[city manager]] [[William R. Hopkins]], on his 82nd birthday in 1951.\n\n===First closure of United hub and establishment of Continental hub===\n[[United Airlines]] established its eastern-most domestic hub in Cleveland after World War II, which it maintained until the mid-1980s, when it closed its Cleveland hub and moved capacity to a new hub at [[Washington Dulles International Airport|Washington\u2013Dulles]]. Following the closure of the United hub, [[Continental Airlines]] (which at the time was a separate carrier and lacked a Midwest hub) responded by adding capacity to Cleveland, as did [[US Airways|USAir]], which was the dominant carrier at the airport from 1987 until the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite news |title=US Air Wants Mini-Hub in Cleveland|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0MpRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4G0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=4135%2C6758109|newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=February 23, 1987|accessdate=July 5, 2012}}</ref>  While USAir soon reduced its schedule from Cleveland, Continental substantially increased its hub capacity, becoming the airport's largest tenant and eventually accounting for upwards of 60 percent of passenger traffic. Continental and the airport both made substantial operational and capital investments in the airport's infrastructure.  In 1992, the airport completed a $50 million renovation of Concourse C, which housed all of Continental's flights.  The renovation included the installation of a continuous skylight, a Continental President's Club lounge, and a new Baggage Claim area.<ref>{{cite web|title=Continental Airlines Concourse C|url=http://www.rpmadison.com/id54_continental_airlines___concourse_c.htm|publisher=Robert P.

During the boarding process for the flight in Cleveland, Mays shot her way onto the plane, shooting and injuring a USAir employee who tried to stop her in the process. Mays then commandeered the plane, took 7 hostages (including an 8-month-old baby), and demanded to be taken to [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]. After a 6-hour stand-off, a SWAT team made up of Cleveland police and FBI agents stormed the plane.  Mays and an officer were shot before police were able to arrest Mays.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1985-01-05-mn-11484-story.html|title=SWAT Team Storms Jetliner in Cleveland : Woman Holding Four Hostages Is Wounded; One Officer Injured|date=January 5, 1985|website=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>\n* On February 17, 1991, a [[Ryan International Airlines]] [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9-15]], a cargo flight bound for [[Indianapolis International Airport]] stalled and crashed after takeoff from CLE due to wing contamination.

Originally meant to be a temporary fix, the airport made the Ground Transportation Center a permanent fixture in May 2017. This angered many travelers, who complained on various social media platforms, as well as local media outlets, garnering negative publicity for the airport's plans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2017/02/travelers_are_unhappy_with_new.html|title=Travelers are unhappy with new Cleveland Hopkins International Airport shuttle stops|publisher=}}</ref> In March 2019, the pick ups and drop offs location for most of the shuttles (except for limo shuttles) have moved to the north end of the baggage claim level.\n\n===Parking===\nIn May 2013, the airport demolished its aging, 2,600-space Long Term Garage, replacing it with a 1,000 space surface lot for $24M.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2015/08/cleveland_hopkins_alters_parking_plans_to_keep_option_of_expanding_garage.html|title=Cleveland Hopkins alters parking plans to keep option of expanding garage (photos)|publisher=}}</ref>  This in turn created a parking shortage, and daily lot closings when parking lots would become full. The airport's Twitter account became a daily update of parking closures at the airport.  The airport converted the Short Term Garage to a so-called Smart Garage, and valet parking garage.  The airport eliminated its free half-hour courtesy parking perk, and began to charge $3 for a half-hour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/09/cleveland_hopkins_airport_open.html|title=Cleveland Hopkins airport opens new overflow parking lot with garage nearing capacity|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ohio World War II Army Airfields]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{Air Force Historical Research Agency}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat}}\n* [http://www.clevelandairport.com/ Official site]\n* {{FAA-diagram|00084}}\n{{US-airport|CLE}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101007012338/http://opshots.net/ OPShots.net -CLE Spotters Site]\n* [http://www.clevelandairport.com/Doing-Business/Project-Information.aspx Master Plan]\n* [https://acukwik.com/Airport-Info/KCLE AC-U-KWIK information for KCLE]\n\n{{Cleveland}}\n{{Portal bar|Aviation}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Airports in Ohio]]\n[[Category:Airports established in 1925]]\n[[Category:Transportation buildings and structures in Cleveland]]\n[[Category:Airfields of the United States Army Air Forces Technical Service Command]]\n[[Category:Airfields of the United States Army Air Forces in Ohio]]\n[[Category:Historic Civil Engineering Landmarks]]\n[[Category:1925 establishments in Ohio]]\n", "name_user": "146.115.123.148", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Fixed typo)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Hopkins_International_Airport"}
