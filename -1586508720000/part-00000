The location was previously known as \"Stonequarry\". The [[Duke of Wellington]] described Picton as a \"rough foul-mouthed devil as ever lived\" but very capable. He was \"respected for his courage and feared for his irrascible temperament\". He was chiefly remembered for his exploits under Wellington in the Iberinan Peninsular War displaying great barvery and persistence. He was killed at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] and was the most senior officer to die there. He was buried in the family vault at St. George's, [[Hanover Square, Westminster|Hanover Square]] in London. In 1859 Picton was re-interred in [[St. Paul's Cathedral, London]], lying close to the body of the Duke of Wellington.<ref name=nswshr-1484-1242>Wheeldon, 2015, 3.</ref><ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\n===Victoria Bridge===\nTimber truss road bridges have played a significant role in the expansion and improvement of the NSW road network. Prior to the bridges being built, river crossings were often dangerous in times of rain, which caused bulk freight movement to be prohibitively expensive for most agricultural and mining produce. Only the high priced wool clip of the time was able to carry the costs and inconvenience imposed by the generally inadequate river crossings that often existed prior to the trusses construction. Timber truss bridges were preferred by the [[NSW Public Works|NSW Public Works Department]] from the mid 19th to the early 20th century because they were relatively cheap to construct, and used mostly local materials. The financially troubled governments of the day applied pressure to the Public Works Department to produce as much road and bridge work for as little cost as possible, using local materials. This condition effectively prohibited the use of iron and steel, as these, prior to the construction of the steel works at [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] in the early 20th century, had to be imported from England.<ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\n[[Timber truss#Allan Truss|Allan trusses]] were the first truly scientifically engineered timber truss bridges, and incorporate American design ideas for the first time. This is a reflection of the changing mindset of the NSW people, who were slowly accepting that American ideas could be as good as or better than European ones. The high quality and low cost of the Allan truss design entrenched the dominance of timber truss bridges for NSW roads for the next thirty years.<ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\nPercy Allan, the designer of Allan truss and other bridges, was a senior engineer of the NSW Public Works Department, and a prominent figure in late 19th century NSW.<ref name=nswshr-1484/> Timber truss bridges, and timber bridges generally were so common that NSW was known to travellers as the \"timber bridge state\".<ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\n== Description ==\nThe Victoria Bridge is an Allan-type timber truss road bridge. It has three timber truss [[Span (architecture)|spans]], each of {{convert|27.4|m|ft|0}}. There are no approach spans. The overall length of the bridge is {{convert|83.4|m|ft|0}}. The super structure is supported by timber trestles which carry a single-lane carriageway with a minimum width of {{convert|3.7|m}} and a footpath. A timber post and rail guard rail extends the full length of the bridge and an Armco barrier protects pedestrians from vehicular traffic.<ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\n=== Condition ===\n\nAs at 15 June 2005, fair and intact.<ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nAs at 15 June 2005, completed in 1897, the Victoria bridge is an early example of an Allan type timber truss road bridge, and in 1998 was in fair condition. As a timber truss road bridge, it has many associational links with important historical events, trends, and people, including the expansion of the road network and economic activity throughout NSW, and Percy Allan, the designer of this type of truss. Allan trusses were third in the five-stage design evolution of NSW timber truss bridges, and were a major improvement over the McDonald trusses which preceded them. Allan trusses were twenty per cent cheaper to build than McDonald trusses, could carry 50 per cent more load, and were easier to maintain. Having the tallest timber trestle supporting piers of any timber truss bridge, the Victoria bridge has an imposing appearance, and is both technically and aesthetically significant as a result.<ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\nIn 1998 there were 38 surviving Allan trusses in NSW of the 105 built, and 82 timber truss road.<ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\nbridges survive from the over 400 built.<ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\nThe Victoria bridge is a representative example of Allan timber truss road bridges, and is assessed as being State significant, primarily on the basis of its technical and historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\nVictoria Bridge over Stonequarry Creek was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThrough the bridge's association with the expansion of the NSW road network, its ability to demonstrate historically important concepts such as the gradual acceptance of NSW people of American design ideas, and its association with Percy Allan, it has historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe bridge exhibits the technical excellence of its design, as all of the structural detail is clearly visible. In the context of its landscape it is visually attractive. As such, the bridge has substantial aesthetic significance. Having the tallest timber trestle supporting piers of any timber truss bridge, the Victoria bridge has an imposing appearance, and is both technically and aesthetically significant as a result.<ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nTimber truss bridges are prominent to road travellers, and NSW has in the past been referred to as the \"timber truss bridge state\". Through this, the complete set of bridges gain some social significance, as they could be said to be held in reasonable esteem by many travellers in NSW. The Victoria bridge is valued by the people of the Picton district.<ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nRare - In 1998 there were 38 surviving Allan trusses in NSW of the 105 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built.<ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nRepresentative of Allan truss bridges.<ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{stack|{{Portal|Australian Roads|New South Wales|Transport|Engineering}}}}\n*[[Historic bridges of New South Wales]]\n*[[List of bridges in Australia]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite web|author=|date=2007|title=Victoria Bridge over Stonequarry Creek|url=http://www.visitnsw.com.au/Operator.aspx?ProductId=9019598}}\n* {{cite book|last=Allan|first=Percy|author-link=Percy Allan|date=1924|title=Highway Bridge Construction.

As a timber truss road bridge, it has many associational links with important historical events, trends, and people, including the expansion of the road network and economic activity throughout NSW, and Percy Allan, the designer of this type of truss. Allan trusses were third in the five-stage design evolution of NSW timber truss bridges, and were a major improvement over the McDonald trusses which preceded them. Allan trusses were twenty per cent cheaper to build than McDonald trusses, could carry 50 per cent more load, and were easier to maintain. Having the tallest timber trestle supporting piers of any timber truss bridge, the Victoria bridge has an imposing appearance, and is both technically and aesthetically significant as a result.<ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\nIn 1998 there were 38 surviving Allan trusses in NSW of the 105 built, and 82 timber truss road.<ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\nbridges survive from the over 400 built.<ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\nThe Victoria bridge is a representative example of Allan timber truss road bridges, and is assessed as being State significant, primarily on the basis of its technical and historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\nVictoria Bridge over Stonequarry Creek was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThrough the bridge's association with the expansion of the NSW road network, its ability to demonstrate historically important concepts such as the gradual acceptance of NSW people of American design ideas, and its association with Percy Allan, it has historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe bridge exhibits the technical excellence of its design, as all of the structural detail is clearly visible. In the context of its landscape it is visually attractive. As such, the bridge has substantial aesthetic significance. Having the tallest timber trestle supporting piers of any timber truss bridge, the Victoria bridge has an imposing appearance, and is both technically and aesthetically significant as a result.<ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nTimber truss bridges are prominent to road travellers, and NSW has in the past been referred to as the \"timber truss bridge state\". Through this, the complete set of bridges gain some social significance, as they could be said to be held in reasonable esteem by many travellers in NSW. The Victoria bridge is valued by the people of the Picton district.<ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nRare - In 1998 there were 38 surviving Allan trusses in NSW of the 105 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built.<ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nRepresentative of Allan truss bridges.<ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{stack|{{Portal|Australian Roads|New South Wales|Transport|Engineering}}}}\n*[[Historic bridges of New South Wales]]\n*[[List of bridges in Australia]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite web|author=|date=2007|title=Victoria Bridge over Stonequarry Creek|url=http://www.visitnsw.com.au/Operator.aspx?ProductId=9019598}}\n* {{cite book|last=Allan|first=Percy|author-link=Percy Allan|date=1924|title=Highway Bridge Construction.

Following a dispute over payment (or possibly, according to local folklore, a spell cast by the witch [[D\u00f2ideag]]), the ship caught fire and the gunpowder [[Magazine (artillery)|magazine]] exploded, sinking the vessel.

The [[James Stewart, 1st Duke of Richmond|Duke of Lennox]] gifted rights to Spanish wrecks near Tobermory to the [[Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquess of Argyll|Marquess of Argyll]]. In 1666 his son the [[Archibald Campbell, 9th Earl of Argyll|Earl of Argyll]] engaged James Maule of Melgum to use [[diving bell]]s to find treasure, and recover the valuable brass cannon. Maule had learnt diving in Sweden, but raised only two brass guns and an iron cannon, and left after three months. It was later said he had hoped to return, thinking he was the only expert diver. Argyll however raised six cannon by workmen under his direction, and next employed John Saint Clare, or Sinclair, son of the minister of [[Ormiston]], in 1676 and a German sub-contractor Hans Albricht van Treileben, who had worked on the wreck of the ''[[Vasa (ship)|Vasa]]''. Next year, the earl transferred the rights to Captain Adolpho E. Smith and Treileben. At this period the fore-part of the wreck was visible above water, and was called the ''Admiral of Florence''. The project was beset with difficulties in 1678; the Admiralty disputed Argyll's rights to the wreck. Captain Adolpho Smith refused to return the diving equipment to William Campbell, captain of the earl's frigate, the ''Anna of Argyll''. The McLean clan fought the divers on land at Tobermory, led by Hector McLean, brother of Lachlan McLean of Torloisk.<ref>''HMC 6th Report (Duke of Argyll)'' (London, 1877), pp. 625-27.</ref>\n\nThe largest attempt made to locate the galleon was in 1950 when [[Ian Campbell, 11th Duke of Argyll|the then Duke of Argyll]] signed a contract with the [[Admiralty|British Admiralty]] to locate the galleon. Nothing came of the attempt, apart from the development of equipment still used today to locate ancient sunk vessels.<ref>{{cite journal\n | title = Preliminary Search for Treasure in Tobermory Bay\n | journal = Popular Mechanics\n | issue = October 1950\n | pages = 160\u2013162\n | url = https://books.google.com/?id=ydgDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA160&dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January#v=onepage&q&f=true\n| date = October 1950\n }}\n</ref>\nOwing to similarities in sailing conditions, in the mid-1800s emigrant sailors created the community of [[Tobermory, Ontario|Tobermory]], located in [[Ontario, Canada]].

Following a dispute over payment (or possibly, according to local folklore, a spell cast by the witch [[D\u00f2ideag]]), the ship caught fire and the gunpowder [[Magazine (artillery)|magazine]] exploded, sinking the vessel. In her hold, reputedly, was \u00a3300,000 worth of [[gold bullion]].<ref>{{cite web\n | title = A Clan Feud, a Spanish Galleon, and a Big Bang\n | publisher = lostfort.blogspot.com\n | url = http://lostfort.blogspot.com/2010/02/clan-feud-spanish-galleon-and-big-bang.html\n | accessdate = 10 July 2010\n}}\n</ref>\nOther sources claim the vessel was the ''San Juan de Sicilia'' (or ''San Juan de Baptista''), which, records indicate, carried troops, not treasure.<ref>{{cite web\n |title      = The Galleon San Francisco\n |publisher  = shipmodeling.net\n |url        = http://shipmodeling.net/vb_forum/thread1722-Galleon-San-Francisco-information-.html\n |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110724063137/http://shipmodeling.net/vb_forum/thread1722-Galleon-San-Francisco-information-.html\n |url-status   = dead\n |archive-date = 24 July 2011\n |accessdate = 10 July 2010\n}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://news.scotsman.com/iainlundy/The-Tobermory-wreck-that-promises.2765124.jp\n | title = The Tobermory Wreck\n | publisher = The Scotsman\n | accessdate = 10 July 2010\n}}\n</ref><ref name=\"BAM2008\">{{cite web\n | year = 2002\n | url = http://www.britarch.ac.uk/BA/ba64/feat1.shtml\n | title = British Archaeology Magazine \u2013 Guns of the Armada \u2013 Colin Martin\n | accessdate = 29 July 2008\n}}\n</ref>\nWhatever the true story, no significant treasure has ever been recovered in Tobermory Bay.<ref>{{cite web\n |title       = Tobermory Bay\n |publisher   = reese.org\n |url         = http://www.reese.org/duneroller/content/treasure/buried_treasure/tobermory_bay.htm\n |accessdate  = 10 July 2010\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110721114950/http://www.reese.org/duneroller/content/treasure/buried_treasure/tobermory_bay.htm\n |archivedate = 21 July 2011\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}\n</ref>\n\nSeventeenth-century efforts to salvage the treasure are well-documented. The [[James Stewart, 1st Duke of Richmond|Duke of Lennox]] gifted rights to Spanish wrecks near Tobermory to the [[Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquess of Argyll|Marquess of Argyll]]. In 1666 his son the [[Archibald Campbell, 9th Earl of Argyll|Earl of Argyll]] engaged James Maule of Melgum to use [[diving bell]]s to find treasure, and recover the valuable brass cannon. Maule had learnt diving in Sweden, but raised only two brass guns and an iron cannon, and left after three months. It was later said he had hoped to return, thinking he was the only expert diver. Argyll however raised six cannon by workmen under his direction, and next employed John Saint Clare, or Sinclair, son of the minister of [[Ormiston]], in 1676 and a German sub-contractor Hans Albricht van Treileben, who had worked on the wreck of the ''[[Vasa (ship)|Vasa]]''. Next year, the earl transferred the rights to Captain Adolpho E. Smith and Treileben. At this period the fore-part of the wreck was visible above water, and was called the ''Admiral of Florence''. The project was beset with difficulties in 1678; the Admiralty disputed Argyll's rights to the wreck. Captain Adolpho Smith refused to return the diving equipment to William Campbell, captain of the earl's frigate, the ''Anna of Argyll''. The McLean clan fought the divers on land at Tobermory, led by Hector McLean, brother of Lachlan McLean of Torloisk.<ref>''HMC 6th Report (Duke of Argyll)'' (London, 1877), pp. 625-27.</ref>\n\nThe largest attempt made to locate the galleon was in 1950 when [[Ian Campbell, 11th Duke of Argyll|the then Duke of Argyll]] signed a contract with the [[Admiralty|British Admiralty]] to locate the galleon. Nothing came of the attempt, apart from the development of equipment still used today to locate ancient sunk vessels.<ref>{{cite journal\n | title = Preliminary Search for Treasure in Tobermory Bay\n | journal = Popular Mechanics\n | issue = October 1950\n | pages = 160\u2013162\n | url = https://books.google.com/?id=ydgDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA160&dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January#v=onepage&q&f=true\n| date = October 1950\n }}\n</ref>\nOwing to similarities in sailing conditions, in the mid-1800s emigrant sailors created the community of [[Tobermory, Ontario|Tobermory]], located in [[Ontario, Canada]]. This namesake town has twin harbours, known locally as \"Big Tub\" and \"Little Tub\", which sheltered ships from the severe storms of [[Lake Huron]].\n\nDuring the [[World War II|Second World War]], Tobermory was home to [[Royal Navy]] training base [[HMS Western Isles|HMS ''Western Isles'']], under the command of the legendary [[Vice-Admiral]] Sir [[Gilbert Stephenson]], the so-called \"Terror of Tobermory\".

Beowulf finally slays the dragon, but is mortally wounded in the struggle. He is cremated and a burial mound by the sea is erected in his honour.\n\n''Beowulf'' is considered an epic poem in that the main character is a hero who travels great distances to prove his strength at impossible odds against supernatural demons and beasts. The poem also begins ''[[in medias res]]'' or simply, \"in the middle of things,\" which is a characteristic of the epics of antiquity. Although the poem begins with Beowulf's arrival, Grendel's attacks have been an ongoing event. An elaborate history of characters and their lineages is spoken of, as well as their interactions with each other, debts owed and repaid, and deeds of valour. The warriors form a kind of brotherhood linked by loyalty to their lord. The poem begins and ends with funerals: at the beginning of the poem for [[Scyld Scefing]] (26\u201345) and at the end for Beowulf (3140\u20133170).\n\n=== First battle: Grendel  ===\n\n''Beowulf'' begins with the story of Hrothgar, who constructed the great hall [[Heorot]] for himself and his warriors. In it, he, his wife [[Wealh\u00feeow|Wealhtheow]], and his warriors spend their time singing and celebrating. Grendel, a troll-like monster said to be descended from the biblical [[Cain]], is pained by the sounds of joy.<ref>''Beowulf'', 87\u201398</ref> Grendel attacks the hall and kills and devours many of Hrothgar's warriors while they sleep.

[[Unfer\u00f0]], a warrior who had earlier challenged him, presents Beowulf with his sword [[Hrunting]]. After stipulating a number of conditions to Hrothgar in case of his death (including the taking in of his kinsmen and the inheritance by Unferth of Beowulf's estate), Beowulf jumps into the lake, and while harassed by water monsters gets to the bottom, where he finds a cavern. Grendel's mother pulls him in, and she and Beowulf engage in fierce combat.\n\nAt first, Grendel's mother appears to prevail, and Hrunting proves incapable of hurting the woman; she throws Beowulf to the ground and, sitting astride him, tries to kill him with a short sword, but Beowulf is saved by his armour. Beowulf spots another sword, hanging on the wall and apparently made for giants, and cuts her head off with it. Travelling further into Grendel's mother's lair, Beowulf discovers Grendel's corpse and severs his head with the sword, whose blade melts because of the \"hot blood\". Only the hilt remains. Beowulf swims back up to the rim of the pond where his men wait. Carrying the hilt of the sword and Grendel's head, he presents them to Hrothgar upon his return to Heorot.  Hrothgar gives Beowulf many gifts, including the sword [[N\u00e6gling]], his family's heirloom. The events prompt a long reflection by the king, sometimes referred to as \"Hrothgar's sermon\", in which he urges Beowulf to be wary of pride and to reward his [[thegn]]s.<ref>{{cite journal\n |last1=Hansen |first1=E.

One day, fifty years after Beowulf's battle with Grendel's mother, a [[slave]] steals a golden cup from the lair of a dragon at Earnan\u00e6s. When the dragon sees that the cup has been stolen, it leaves its cave in a rage, burning everything in sight. Beowulf and his warriors come to fight the dragon, but Beowulf tells his men that he will fight the dragon alone and that they should wait on the barrow. Beowulf descends to do battle with the dragon, but finds himself outmatched. His men, upon seeing this and fearing for their lives, retreat into the woods. One of his men, Wiglaf, however, in great distress at Beowulf's plight, comes to his aid. The two slay the dragon, but Beowulf is mortally wounded. After Beowulf dies, Wiglaf remains by his side, grief-stricken. When the rest of the men finally return, Wiglaf bitterly admonishes them, blaming their cowardice for Beowulf's death. Afterward, Beowulf is ritually burned on a great pyre in Geatland while his people wail and mourn him, fearing that without him, the Geats are defenceless against attacks from surrounding tribes. Afterwards, a barrow, visible from the sea, is built in his memory (''Beowulf'' lines 2712\u20133182).<ref>{{Citation |title=Beowulf |publisher=MU |place=SA |url=https://faculty.mu.edu.sa/public/uploads/1348946962.7014beowulf.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324051854/https://faculty.mu.edu.sa/public/uploads/1348946962.7014beowulf.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2014-03-24 }}.</ref>\n\n== Authorship and date ==\nThe dating of ''Beowulf'' has attracted considerable scholarly attention and opinion differs as to whether it was first written in the 8th century or whether the composition of the poem was nearly contemporary with its eleventh century manuscript and whether a proto-version of the poem (possibly a version of the [[Bear's Son Tale]]) was orally transmitted before being transcribed in its present form.

The ''Beowulf'' manuscript is known as the Nowell Codex, gaining its name from 16th-century scholar [[Laurence Nowell]]. The official designation is \"[[British Library]], Cotton Vitellius A.XV\" because it was one of [[Sir Robert Cotton, 1st Baronet, of Connington|Sir Robert Bruce Cotton]]'s holdings in the [[Cotton library]] in the middle of the 17th century. Many private antiquarians and book collectors, such as Sir Robert Cotton, used their own [[library classification]] systems. \"Cotton Vitellius A.XV\" translates as: the 15th book from the left on shelf A (the top shelf) of the bookcase with the bust of Roman Emperor [[Vitellius]] standing on top of it, in Cotton's collection. Kevin Kiernan argues that Nowell most likely acquired it through [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley]], in 1563, when Nowell entered Cecil's household as a [[tutor]] to his ward, [[Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kiernan|first=Kevin S.|title=Pride and Prodigies: Studies in the Monsters of the \"Beowulf\"-Manuscript.Andy Orchard|journal=Speculum|volume=73 |issue=3 |year=1998 |pages=879\u2013881 |jstor=2887546|doi=10.2307/2887546}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest extant reference to the first foliation of the Nowell Codex was made sometime between 1628 and 1650 by [[Franciscus Junius (the younger)]].<ref name=\"Beowulf and the Beowulf Manuscript\">{{cite book|last1=Kiernan|first1=Kevin|title=Beowulf and the Beowulf Manuscript|date=1981|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick |edition=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yv8cnwEACAAJ |accessdate=October 6, 2017|isbn=9780472084128}}</ref>{{rp|91}} The ownership of the codex before Nowell remains a mystery.<ref name=\"Beowulf and the Beowulf Manuscript\"/>{{rp|120}}\n\nThe Reverend [[Thomas Smith (scholar)|Thomas Smith]] (1638\u20131710) and [[Humfrey Wanley]] (1672\u20131726) both catalogued the Cotton library (in which the Nowell Codex was held). Smith's catalogue appeared in 1696, and Wanley's in 1705.{{sfn|Joy|2005|p=2}} The ''Beowulf'' manuscript itself is identified by name for the first time in an exchange of letters in 1700 between George Hickes, Wanley's assistant, and Wanley. In the letter to Wanley, Hickes responds to an apparent charge against Smith, made by Wanley, that Smith had failed to mention the ''Beowulf'' script when cataloguing Cotton MS. Vitellius A. XV. Hickes replies to Wanley \"I can find nothing yet of Beowulph.\"{{sfn|Joy|2005|p=24}} Kiernan theorised that Smith failed to mention the ''Beowulf'' manuscript because of his reliance on previous catalogues or because either he had no idea how to describe it or because it was temporarily out of the codex.{{sfn|Kiernan|1996|pp=73\u201374}}\n\nIt suffered damage in the Cotton Library fire at [[Ashburnham House]] in 1731. Since then, parts of the manuscript have crumbled along with many of the letters. Rebinding efforts, though saving the manuscript from much degeneration, have nonetheless covered up other letters of the poem, causing further loss.

The first scribe made a point of carefully regularizing the spelling of the original document by using the common West Saxon language and by avoiding any archaic or dialectical features. The second scribe, who wrote the remainder, with a difference in handwriting noticeable after line 1939, seems to have written more vigorously and with less interest. As a result, the second scribe's script retains more archaic dialectic features, which allow modern scholars to ascribe the poem a cultural context.<ref name=\"Beowulf: Revised Edition\">{{cite book|last1=Swanton|first1=Michael|title=Beowulf: Revised Edition|date=1997|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester|isbn=978-0719051463|page=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Ks8nj3BGEQC|accessdate=14 September 2017}}</ref> While both scribes appear to have proofread their work, there are nevertheless many errors.<ref>{{cite news |author=Leonard Neidorf |year=2013 |journal=Anglo-Saxon England |volume=42 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=9099642&fileId=S0263675113000124 |pages=249\u201369 |title=Scribal errors of proper names in the ''Beowulf'' manuscript |doi=10.1017/s0263675113000124}}</ref> The second scribe was ultimately the more conservative copyist as he did not modify the spelling of the text as he wrote but copied what he saw in front of him. In the way that it is currently bound, the ''Beowulf'' manuscript is followed by the Old English poem ''[[Judith (poem)|Judith]]''.

Wormholes found in the last leaves of the ''Beowulf'' manuscript that are absent in the ''Judith'' manuscript suggest that at one point ''Beowulf'' ended the volume.

Rather, given the implications of the theory of [[oral-formulaic composition]] and oral tradition, the question concerns how the poem is to be understood, and what sorts of interpretations are legitimate.\n\nScholarly discussion about ''Beowulf'' in the context of the oral tradition was extremely active throughout the 1960s and 1970s. The debate might be framed starkly as follows: on the one hand, we can hypothesise a poem put together from various tales concerning the hero (the Grendel episode, the Grendel's mother story, and the fire drake narrative). These fragments would have been told for many years in tradition, and learned by apprenticeship from one generation of illiterate poets to the next. The poem is composed orally and extemporaneously, and the archive of tradition on which it draws is oral, pagan, Germanic, heroic, and tribal. On the other hand, one might posit a poem which is composed by a literate scribe, who acquired literacy by way of learning Latin (and absorbing Latinate culture and ways of thinking), probably a monk and therefore profoundly Christian in outlook. On this view, the pagan references would be a sort of decorative archaising.<ref name=\"COLORING210-217\">{{Citation|last=Blackburn|first=FA|title=The Christian Coloring of Beowulf|journal=PMLA|volume=12|issue=2|pages=210\u201317|year=1897|doi=10.2307/456133|jstor=456133}}</ref><ref name=\"BENSON193-213\">{{Citation|last=Benson|first=Larry D|title=The Pagan Coloring of Beowulf|work=Old English Poetry: fifteen essays|pages=193\u2013213|year=1967|editor-last=Creed|editor-first=RP|place=Providence, [[Rhode Island]]|publisher=Brown University Press}}</ref> There is a third view that sees merit in both arguments above and attempts to bridge them, and so cannot be articulated as starkly as they can; it sees more than one [[Christianity]] and more than one attitude towards paganism at work in the poem; it sees the poem as initially the product of a literate Christian author with one foot in the pagan world and one in the Christian, himself perhaps a convert (or one whose forebears had been pagan), a poet who was conversant in both oral and literary composition and was capable of a masterful \"repurposing\" of poetry from the oral tradition.\n\nHowever, scholars such as D.K. Crowne have proposed the idea that the poem was passed down from reciter to reciter under the theory of [[oral-formulaic composition]], which hypothesises that epic poems were (at least to some extent) improvised by whoever was reciting them, and only much later written down. In his landmark work, ''[[The Singer of Tales]]'', [[Albert Lord]] refers to the work of [[Francis Peabody Magoun]] and others, saying \"the documentation is complete, thorough, and accurate.

These are important in helping historians understand the ''Beowulf'' manuscript, as possible source-texts or influences would suggest time-frames of composition, geographic boundaries within which it could be composed, or range (both spatial and temporal) of influence (i.e. when it was \"popular\" and where its \"popularity\" took it).\n\nThere are Scandinavian sources, international folkloric sources, and Celtic sources.{{Efn|Ecclesiastical or biblical influences are only seen as adding \"Christian color\", in Andersson's survey. Old English sources hinges on the hypothesis that ''[[Genesis A]]'' predates ''Beowulf''.}}{{sfn|Andersson|1998|pp=125, 129}}\n\n===Scandinavian parallels and sources===\n19th century studies proposed that ''Beowulf'' was translated from a lost original Scandinavian work, but this idea was quickly abandoned. But Scandinavian works have continued to be studied as a possible source.{{sfn|Andersson|1998|pp=130\u2013131}} Proponents included Gregor Sarrazin writing in 1886 that an [[Old Norse]] original version of ''Beowulf'' must have existed,{{sfn|Andersson|1998|p=130}} but that view was later debunked by Carl Wilhelm von Sydow (1914) who pointed out that ''Beowulf'' is fundamentally [[Christianity|Christian]] and written at a time when any Norse tale would have most likely been [[paganism|pagan]].{{sfn|Andersson|1998|p=135}}<!--This bit relocated from \"Irish folktale\" content below-->\n\n====Grettis saga====\nThe epic's possible connection to ''[[Grettis saga]]'', an Icelandic [[Sagas of Icelanders|family saga]], was made early on by [[Gu\u00f0brandur Vigf\u00fasson]] (1878).{{sfn|Andersson|1998|pp=130\u201331}}\n\n''Grettis saga'' is a story about [[Grettir \u00c1smundarson]], a great-grandson of an Icelandic settler, and so cannot be as old as ''Beowulf''. [[Axel Olrik]] (1903) claimed that on the contrary, this saga was a reworking of ''Beowulf'', and others followed suit.{{sfn|Andersson|1998|p=130}}\n\nHowever, Friedrich Panzer (1910) wrote a thesis in which both ''Beowulf'' and ''Grettis saga'' drew from a common folkloric source, and this encouraged even a detractor such as W. W. Lawrence to reposition his view, and entertain the possibility that certain elements in the saga (such as the waterfall in place of the ''mere'') retained an older form.{{sfn|Andersson|1998|p=130}}\n\nThe viability of this connection has enjoyed enduring support, and was characterized as one of the few Scandinavian [[Analogue (literature)|analogues]] to receive a general consensus of potential connection by Theodore M.

The story survives in Old Norse ''[[Hr\u00f3lfs saga kraka]]'' and [[Saxo Grammaticus|Saxo]]'s ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''. Hrolf kraki, one of the [[Scylding|Skj\u00f6ldungs]], even appears as \"Hrothulf\" in the Anglo-Saxon epic.

Jorgensen, looking for a more concise frame of reference, coined a \"two-troll tradition\" that covers both ''Beowulf'' and ''Grettis saga'': \"a [[Viking art|Norse]] '[[ecotype]]' in which a hero enters a cave and kills two giants, usually of different sexes\";{{sfn|Andersson|1998|p=134}} which has emerged as a more attractive folk tale parallel, according to a 1998 assessment by Andersson.{{sfn|Andersson|1998|p=146}}<ref>{{harv|Vickrey|2009|p=209}}: \"I shall continue to use the term ''Bear's Son'' for the folktale in question; it is established in Beowulf criticism and certainly Stitt has justified its retention\".</ref>\n\n====Celtic folktales====\n<!-- [[Wilhelm Grimm]] is noted to be the first person to link ''Beowulf'' with Irish folklore; ** Andersson pp. 134\u2013135 suggests this was misconception by Hugo Gering-->Similarity of the epic to the Irish folktale \"The Hand and the Child\" had already been noted by [[Albert Stanburrough Cook|Albert S.

In 1926, [[Albert Stanburrough Cook|Albert S. Cook]] suggested a Homeric connection due to equivalent formulas, [[metonymy|metonymies]], and analogous voyages.{{sfn|Cook|1926}} In 1930, James A. Work also supported the Homeric influence, stating that encounter between Beowulf and [[Unfer\u00f0|Unferth]] was parallel to the encounter between Odysseus and [[Nisus and Euryalus|Euryalus]] in Books 7\u20138 of the ''Odyssey,'' even to the point of both characters giving the hero the same gift of a sword upon being proven wrong in their initial assessment of the hero's prowess. This theory of Homer's influence on ''Beowulf'' remained very prevalent in the 1920s, but started to die out in the following decade when a handful of critics stated that the two works were merely \"comparative literature\",{{sfn|Andersson|1998|p=138}} although Greek was known in late 7th century England: [[Bede]] states that [[Theodore of Tarsus]], a Greek, was appointed [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in 668, and he taught Greek.

Considerably more than one-third of the total vocabulary is alien from ordinary prose use. There are, in round numbers, three hundred and sixty uncompounded verbs in ''Beowulf'', and forty of them are poetical words in the sense that they are unrecorded or rare in the existing prose writings. One hundred and fifty more occur with the prefix ''ge''- (reckoning a few found only in the past-participle), but of these one hundred occur also as simple verbs, and the prefix is employed to render a shade of meaning which was perfectly known and thoroughly familiar except in the latest Anglo-Saxon period. The nouns number sixteen hundred. Seven hundred of them, including those formed with prefixes, of which fifty (or considerably more than half) have ''ge''-, are simple nouns, at the highest reckoning not more than one-quarter is absent in prose. That this is due in some degree to accident is clear from the character of the words, and from the fact that several reappear and are common after the Norman Conquest.<ref>{{Citation |first=Ritchie |last=Girvan |title=Beowulf and the Seventh Century Language and Content |publisher=Methuen & Co |place=New Feller Lane: London EC4 |year=1971 |type=print}}</ref>\n\n== Form and metre ==\nAn Old English poem such as ''Beowulf'' is very different from modern poetry. Anglo-Saxon poets typically used [[alliterative verse]], a form of [[poetry|verse]] in which the first half of the line (the a-verse) is linked to the second half (the b-verse) through [[alliteration|similarity in initial sound]]. In addition, the two halves are divided by a [[caesura]]: \"Oft '''Sc'''yld '''Sc'''efing \\\\ '''sc'''ea\u00feena \u00fereatum\" (l. 4). This verse form maps stressed and unstressed syllables onto abstract entities known as metrical positions. There is no fixed number of beats per line: the first one cited has three (Oft SCYLD SCEFING, with [[Systems of scansion#Overview|ictus]] on the suffix -ING) whereas the second has two (SCEA\u00feena \u00deREATum).\n\nThe poet has a choice of [[epithets]] or formulae to use in order to fulfil the alliteration. When speaking or reading Old English poetry, it is important to remember for alliterative purposes that many of the letters are not pronounced in the same way as in [[modern English]]. The letter {{angbr|h}}, for example, is always pronounced (''Hro\u00f0gar'': {{IPA-ang|\u02c8hro\u00f0gar|}}), and the digraph {{angbr|cg}} is pronounced {{IPA-ang|d\u0292|}}, as in the word ''edge''. Both {{angbr|f}} and {{angbr|s}} vary in pronunciation depending on their phonetic environment. Between vowels or [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] consonants, they are voiced, sounding like modern {{angbr|v}} and {{angbr|z}}, respectively. Otherwise they are unvoiced, like modern {{angbr|f}} in ''fat'' and {{angbr|s}} in ''sat''. Some letters which are no longer found in modern English, such as thorn, {{angbr|\u00fe}}, and eth, {{angbr|\u00f0}} \u2013 representing both pronunciations of modern English {{angbr|th}}, as {{IPAc-en|\u03b8}} in ''thing'' and {{IPAc-en|\u00f0}} ''this'' \u2013 are used extensively both in the original manuscript and in modern English editions. The voicing of these characters echoes that of {{angbr|f}} and {{angbr|s}}. Both are voiced (as in ''this'') between other voiced sounds: ''o\u00f0er'', ''la\u00feleas'', ''su\u00feern''. Otherwise they are unvoiced (as in ''thing''): ''\u00feunor'', ''su\u00f0'', ''so\u00fef\u00e6st''.\n\n[[Kenning]]s are also a significant technique in ''Beowulf''. They are evocative poetic descriptions of everyday things, often created to fill the alliterative requirements of the metre. For example, a poet might call the sea the \"swan-road\" or the \"whale-road\"; a king might be called a \"ring-giver.\" There are many kennings in ''Beowulf'', and the device is typical of much of classic poetry in Old English, which is heavily formulaic. The poem also makes extensive use of [[elision|elided]] [[metaphor]]s.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Greenblatt|editor1-first=Stephen|editor2-last=Abrams|editor2-first=Meyer Howard|editor1-link=Beowulf|title=The Norton Anthology of English Literature|date=2006|publisher=W.

R. R. Tolkien]] argued in ''[[Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics]]'' that the poem is not an epic, and while no conventional term exactly fits, the nearest would be [[elegy]].{{Sfn|Tolkien|1997|p=31}}<!--Tolkien wrote (on the 27th of 29 pages of the essay):  Beowulf is not an \"epic,\" not even a magnified \"lay.\" No terms borrowed from Greek or other literatures exactly fit: there is no reason why they should. Though if we must have a term, we should choose rather \"elegy.\" It is an heroic-elegiac poem; and in a sense all its first 3,136 lines are the prelude to a dirge: him tha gegiredan Geata leode ad ofer eorthan unwaclicne [\"the Geatish people then built a pyre on that high ground, no mean thing\"]: one of the most moving ever written.     -->\n\n== Interpretation and criticism ==\n[[File: David Woodard Exploding Beowulf.jpg|thumb|[[David Woodard]] appears as both Beowulf and Grendel in the stage production ''Exploding Beowulf'' (Berlin, 2010)]]\n\nThe history of modern ''Beowulf'' criticism is often said to begin with [[J. R. R. Tolkien]],{{sfn|Orchard|2003a|p=7}} author and Merton professor of Anglo-Saxon at [[University of Oxford]], who in his 1936 lecture to the [[British Academy]] criticised his contemporaries' excessive interest in its historical implications.{{Sfn|Tolkien|2006|p=7}} He noted in ''Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics'' that as a result the poem's literary value had been largely overlooked and argued that the poem \"is in fact so interesting as poetry, in places poetry so powerful, that this quite overshadows the historical content...\"{{Sfn|Tolkien|1958|p=7}}<!--Tolkien wrote on the 3rd page of the essay:   So far from being a poem so poor that only its accidental historical interest can still recommend it, Beowulf is in fact so interesting as poetry, in places poetry so powerful, that this quite overshadows the historical content, and is largely independent even of the most important facts (such as the date and identity of Hygelac) that research has discovered. It is indeed a curious fact that it is one of the peculiar poetic virtues of Beowulf that has contributed to its critical misfortunes. The illusion of historical truth and perspective, which has made Beowulf seem such an attractive quarry, is largely a product of art.     -->\n\n=== Paganism and Christianity ===\nIn historical terms, the poem's characters would have been [[Norse religion|Norse pagans]] (the historical events of the poem took place before the [[Christianization of Scandinavia|Christianisation of Scandinavia]]), yet the poem was recorded by Christian Anglo-Saxons who had mostly converted from their native [[Anglo-Saxon paganism]] around the 7th century \u2013 both Anglo-Saxon paganism and Norse paganism share a common origin as both are forms of [[Germanic paganism]]. ''Beowulf'' thus depicts a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic warrior society]], in which the relationship between the lord of the region and those who served under him was of paramount importance.<ref name=\"Leyerle\">{{cite book |last=Leyerle |first=John |editor-last =Fulk |editor-first=Robert Dennis |title=Interpretations of Beowulf: A Critical Anthology |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_sU0bTfcIjYC&pg=PA155 |accessdate =17 August 2013|year=1991|publisher=Indiana UP|isbn=978-0-253-20639-8 |pages=146\u201367|chapter=The Interlace Structure of Beowulf}}</ref>\n\nIn terms of the relationship between characters in ''Beowulf'' to God, one might recall the substantial amount of paganism that is present throughout the work. Literary critics such as [[Fred C. Robinson]] argue that the ''Beowulf'' poet tries to send a message to readers during the Anglo-Saxon time period regarding the state of Christianity in their own time. Robinson argues that the intensified religious aspects of the Anglo-Saxon period inherently shape the way in which the poet alludes to paganism as presented in ''Beowulf''. The poet calls on Anglo-Saxon readers to recognize the imperfect aspects of their supposed Christian lifestyles. In other words, the poet is referencing their \"Anglo-Saxon Heathenism.\" In terms of the characters of the epic itself, Robinson argues that readers are \"impressed\" by the courageous acts of Beowulf and the speeches of Hrothgar (181). But one is ultimately left to feel sorry for both men as they are fully detached from supposed \"Christian truth\" (181). The relationship between the characters of ''Beowulf'', and the overall message of the poet, regarding their relationship with God is debated among readers and literary critics alike.\n\nAt the same time, Richard North argues that the ''Beowulf'' poet interpreted \"Danish myths in Christian form\" (as the poem would have served as a form of entertainment for a Christian audience), and states: \"As yet we are no closer to finding out why the first audience of ''Beowulf'' liked to hear stories about people routinely classified as damned. This question is pressing, given... that Anglo-Saxons saw the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] as '{{linktext|heathen}}s' rather than as foreigners.\"{{Sfn|North|2006|p=195}} [[Grendel's mother]] and [[Grendel]] are described as descendants of Cain, a fact which some scholars link to the Cain tradition.<ref>{{Citation |last=Williams |first=David |title=Cain and Beowulf: A Study in Secular Allegory |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=1982}}</ref>\n\nOther scholars disagree, however, as to the meaning and nature of the poem: is it a Christian work set in a Germanic pagan context? The question suggests that the conversion from the Germanic pagan beliefs to Christian ones was a prolonged and gradual process over several centuries, and it remains unclear the ultimate nature of the poem's message in respect to religious belief at the time it was written. Robert F. Yeager notes the facts that form the basis for these questions:\n\n{{Quote |That the scribes of Cotton Vitellius A.XV were Christian beyond doubt, and it is equally sure that Beowulf was composed in a Christianised England since conversion took place in the sixth and seventh centuries. The only Biblical references in Beowulf are to the Old Testament, and Christ is never mentioned. The poem is set in pagan times, and none of the characters is demonstrably Christian. In fact, when we are told what anyone in the poem believes, we learn that they are pagans. Beowulf's own beliefs are not expressed explicitly. He offers eloquent prayers to a higher power, addressing himself to the \"Father Almighty\" or the \"Wielder of All.\" Were those the prayers of a pagan who used phrases the Christians subsequently appropriated? Or, did the poem's author intend to see Beowulf as a Christian Ur-hero, symbolically refulgent with Christian virtues?<ref name=\"nhum\">{{cite web |last=Yeager |first=Robert F |publisher=National Endowment For The Humanities |accessdate=2 October 2007 |url=http://www.neh.gov/news/humanities/1999-03/yeager.html |title=Why Read Beowulf? |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930202351/http://www.neh.gov/news/humanities/1999-03/yeager.html |archive-date=30 September 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>}}\n\nThe location of the composition of the poem is also intensely disputed. In 1914, [[F.W. Moorman]], the first professor of English Language at [[University of Leeds]], claimed that ''Beowulf'' was composed in Yorkshire,<ref>F. W. Moorman, 'English Place Names and the Teutonic Sagas,'in Oliver Elton (ed.), ''English Association Essays and Studies,'' vol. 5 (Oxford: Clarendon, 1914) pp. 75ff</ref> but E. Talbot Donaldson claims that it was probably composed more than twelve hundred years ago, during the first half of the eighth century, and that the writer was a native of what was then called West Mercia, located in the Western Midlands of England. However, the late tenth-century manuscript \"which alone preserves the poem\" originated in the kingdom of the [[Wessex|West Saxons]] \u2013 as it is more commonly known.<ref name=\" Tuso, F. Joseph 1975\">{{Citation |last=Tuso |first=F Joseph |title=Beowulf: The Donaldson Translation Backgrounds and Sources Criticism |publisher=Norton & Co |place=New York |year=1975 |page=97}}</ref> Donaldson wrote that \"the poet who put the materials into their present form was a Christian and&nbsp;... poem reflects a Christian tradition\".<ref>Tuso, \"''Donaldson Translation'',\" 98</ref>\n\n=== Politics and warfare ===\n[[Stanley B. Greenfield]] has suggested that references to the human body throughout ''Beowulf'' emphasise the relative position of [[Thegn|thanes]] to their lord. He argues that the term \"shoulder-companion\" could refer to both a physical arm as well as a thane (Aeschere) who was very valuable to his lord (Hrothgar). With Aeschere's death, Hrothgar turns to Beowulf as his new \"arm.\"{{Sfn|Greenfield|1989|p=59}} Also, Greenfield argues the foot is used for the opposite effect, only appearing four times in the poem. It is used in conjunction with [[Unfer\u00f0]] (a man described by Beowulf as weak, traitorous, and cowardly). Greenfield notes that Unfer\u00f0 is described as \"at the king's feet\" (line 499). Unfer\u00f0 is also a member of the foot troops, who, throughout the story, do nothing and \"generally serve as backdrops for more heroic action.\"{{Sfn|Greenfield|1989|p=61}}\n\nDaniel Podgorski has argued that the work is best understood as an examination of inter-generational vengeance-based conflict, or [[feud]]ing.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://thegemsbok.com/art-reviews-and-articles/book-reviews-tuesday-tome-beowulf/|title=Ending Unending Feuds: The Portent of ''Beowulf'''s Historicization of Violent Conflict|last=Podgorski|first=Daniel|date=3 November 2015|website=The Gemsbok|access-date=13 February 2018}}</ref> In this context, the poem operates as an indictment of feuding conflicts as a function of its conspicuous, circuitous, and lengthy depiction of the [[Geatish-Swedish wars]]\u2014coming into contrast with the poem's depiction of the protagonist Beowulf as being disassociated from the ongoing feuds in every way.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{Portal|Anglo-Saxon England}}\n* [[List of Beowulf characters|List of ''Beowulf'' characters]]\n* [[On Translating Beowulf|On Translating ''Beowulf'']]\n* [[Sutton Hoo helmet#Beowulf|Sutton Hoo helmet \u00a7 ''Beowulf'']]\n* [[Heliand]] - Old Saxon Poem about Christ written in style of Germanic Epic and the oldest literary work of Continental Saxons.\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Notes ===\n{{notelist|notes=}}\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{Citation |editor-last=Anderson |editor-first=Sarah |title=Introduction and historical/cultural contexts |publisher=Longman Cultural |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-321-10720-6}}.\n* {{citation |last=Andersson |first=Theodore M. |title=Sources and Analogues |work=A Beowulf Handbook |editor1-last=Bjork |editor1-first=Robert E. |editor2-first=John D. |editor2-last=Niles |location=Lincoln, Nebraska |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |date=1998 |pages=125\u201348 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SaFdpGdjvtoC&pg=PA125 |isbn=9780803261501}}\n* {{Citation |last=Carruthers |first=Leo |chapter=Rewriting Genres: ''Beowulf'' as Epic Romance |title=Palimpsests and the Literary Imagination of Medieval England |editor1-first=Leo |editor1-last=Carruthers |editor2-first=Raeleen |editor2-last=Chai-Elsholz |editor3-first=Tatjana |editor3-last=Silec |location=New York |publisher=Palgrave |date=2011 |pages=139\u201355 |isbn=9780230100268}}\n* {{Citation |last=Chadwick |first=Nora K. |author-link=Nora K.

After Beowulf slays him, [[Grendel's mother]] attacks the hall and is then also defeated. Victorious, Beowulf goes home to Geatland ([[G\u00f6taland]] in modern Sweden) and becomes king of the Geats. Fifty years later, Beowulf defeats a [[The Dragon (Beowulf)|dragon]], but is mortally wounded in the battle. After his death, his attendants cremate his body and erect a tower on a headland in his memory.\n\nThe poem survives in a single copy in the manuscript known as the [[Nowell Codex]].

He attacks the dragon with the help of his ''[[thegn]]s'' or servants, but they do not succeed. Beowulf decides to follow the dragon to its lair at [[Earnaness|Earnan\u00e6s]], but only his young Swedish relative [[Wiglaf]], whose name means \"remnant of valour\",{{refn|group=\"lower-alpha\"|\"w\u00edg\" means \"fight, battle, war, conflict\"<ref>{{cite web |title=W\u00edg |url=http://bosworth.ff.cuni.cz/035625 |website=Bosworth-Toller Anglo-Saxon Dictionary |accessdate=23 October 2014}}</ref> and \"l\u00e1f\" means \"remnant, left-over\"<ref>{{cite web |title=L\u00e1f |url=http://bosworth.ff.cuni.cz/021034 |website=Bosworth-Toller Anglo-Saxon Dictionary |accessdate=23 October 2014}}</ref>}} dares to join him. Beowulf finally slays the dragon, but is mortally wounded in the struggle. He is cremated and a burial mound by the sea is erected in his honour.\n\n''Beowulf'' is considered an epic poem in that the main character is a hero who travels great distances to prove his strength at impossible odds against supernatural demons and beasts. The poem also begins ''[[in medias res]]'' or simply, \"in the middle of things,\" which is a characteristic of the epics of antiquity. Although the poem begins with Beowulf's arrival, Grendel's attacks have been an ongoing event. An elaborate history of characters and their lineages is spoken of, as well as their interactions with each other, debts owed and repaid, and deeds of valour. The warriors form a kind of brotherhood linked by loyalty to their lord. The poem begins and ends with funerals: at the beginning of the poem for [[Scyld Scefing]] (26\u201345) and at the end for Beowulf (3140\u20133170).\n\n=== First battle: Grendel  ===\n\n''Beowulf'' begins with the story of Hrothgar, who constructed the great hall [[Heorot]] for himself and his warriors. In it, he, his wife [[Wealh\u00feeow|Wealhtheow]], and his warriors spend their time singing and celebrating. Grendel, a troll-like monster said to be descended from the biblical [[Cain]], is pained by the sounds of joy.<ref>''Beowulf'', 87\u201398</ref> Grendel attacks the hall and kills and devours many of Hrothgar's warriors while they sleep. Hrothgar and his people, helpless against Grendel, abandon Heorot.\n\nBeowulf, a young warrior from Geatland, hears of Hrothgar's troubles and with his king's permission leaves his homeland to assist Hrothgar.<ref>''Beowulf'', 199\u2013203</ref>\n\nBeowulf and his men spend the night in Heorot. Beowulf refuses to use any weapon because he holds himself to be the equal of Grendel.<ref>''Beowulf'', 675\u2013687</ref> When Grendel enters the hall, Beowulf, who has been feigning sleep, leaps up to clench Grendel's hand.<ref>''Beowulf'', 757\u2013765</ref> Grendel and Beowulf battle each other violently.<ref>''Beowulf'', 766\u2013789</ref> Beowulf's retainers draw their swords and rush to his aid, but their blades cannot pierce Grendel's skin.<ref>''Beowulf'', 793\u2013804</ref> Finally, Beowulf tears Grendel's arm from his body at the shoulder and Grendel runs to his home in the marshes where he dies.<ref>''Beowulf'', 808\u2013823</ref> Beowulf displays \"the whole of Grendel's shoulder and arm, his awesome grasp\" for all to see at Heorot.

Grendel's mother, angry that her son has been killed, sets out to get revenge. \"Beowulf was elsewhere. Earlier, after the award of treasure, The Geat had been given another lodging\"; his assistance would be absent in this battle.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Simpson|first1=James|title=The Norton Anthology of English Literature vol. A|date=2012|publisher=W. W. Norton & Company|location=New York|page=70}}</ref> Grendel's mother violently kills [[\u00c6schere]], who is Hrothgar's most loyal fighter, and escapes.\n\nHrothgar, Beowulf, and their men track Grendel's mother to her lair under a lake. [[Unfer\u00f0]], a warrior who had earlier challenged him, presents Beowulf with his sword [[Hrunting]]. After stipulating a number of conditions to Hrothgar in case of his death (including the taking in of his kinsmen and the inheritance by Unferth of Beowulf's estate), Beowulf jumps into the lake, and while harassed by water monsters gets to the bottom, where he finds a cavern. Grendel's mother pulls him in, and she and Beowulf engage in fierce combat.\n\nAt first, Grendel's mother appears to prevail, and Hrunting proves incapable of hurting the woman; she throws Beowulf to the ground and, sitting astride him, tries to kill him with a short sword, but Beowulf is saved by his armour. Beowulf spots another sword, hanging on the wall and apparently made for giants, and cuts her head off with it. Travelling further into Grendel's mother's lair, Beowulf discovers Grendel's corpse and severs his head with the sword, whose blade melts because of the \"hot blood\". Only the hilt remains. Beowulf swims back up to the rim of the pond where his men wait. Carrying the hilt of the sword and Grendel's head, he presents them to Hrothgar upon his return to Heorot.  Hrothgar gives Beowulf many gifts, including the sword [[N\u00e6gling]], his family's heirloom. The events prompt a long reflection by the king, sometimes referred to as \"Hrothgar's sermon\", in which he urges Beowulf to be wary of pride and to reward his [[thegn]]s.<ref>{{cite journal\n |last1=Hansen |first1=E.

One day, fifty years after Beowulf's battle with Grendel's mother, a [[slave]] steals a golden cup from the lair of a dragon at Earnan\u00e6s. When the dragon sees that the cup has been stolen, it leaves its cave in a rage, burning everything in sight. Beowulf and his warriors come to fight the dragon, but Beowulf tells his men that he will fight the dragon alone and that they should wait on the barrow. Beowulf descends to do battle with the dragon, but finds himself outmatched. His men, upon seeing this and fearing for their lives, retreat into the woods. One of his men, Wiglaf, however, in great distress at Beowulf's plight, comes to his aid. The two slay the dragon, but Beowulf is mortally wounded. After Beowulf dies, Wiglaf remains by his side, grief-stricken. When the rest of the men finally return, Wiglaf bitterly admonishes them, blaming their cowardice for Beowulf's death. Afterward, Beowulf is ritually burned on a great pyre in Geatland while his people wail and mourn him, fearing that without him, the Geats are defenceless against attacks from surrounding tribes. Afterwards, a barrow, visible from the sea, is built in his memory (''Beowulf'' lines 2712\u20133182).<ref>{{Citation |title=Beowulf |publisher=MU |place=SA |url=https://faculty.mu.edu.sa/public/uploads/1348946962.7014beowulf.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324051854/https://faculty.mu.edu.sa/public/uploads/1348946962.7014beowulf.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2014-03-24 }}.</ref>\n\n== Authorship and date ==\nThe dating of ''Beowulf'' has attracted considerable scholarly attention and opinion differs as to whether it was first written in the 8th century or whether the composition of the poem was nearly contemporary with its eleventh century manuscript and whether a proto-version of the poem (possibly a version of the [[Bear's Son Tale]]) was orally transmitted before being transcribed in its present form.

The ''Beowulf'' manuscript is known as the Nowell Codex, gaining its name from 16th-century scholar [[Laurence Nowell]]. The official designation is \"[[British Library]], Cotton Vitellius A.XV\" because it was one of [[Sir Robert Cotton, 1st Baronet, of Connington|Sir Robert Bruce Cotton]]'s holdings in the [[Cotton library]] in the middle of the 17th century. Many private antiquarians and book collectors, such as Sir Robert Cotton, used their own [[library classification]] systems. \"Cotton Vitellius A.XV\" translates as: the 15th book from the left on shelf A (the top shelf) of the bookcase with the bust of Roman Emperor [[Vitellius]] standing on top of it, in Cotton's collection. Kevin Kiernan argues that Nowell most likely acquired it through [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley]], in 1563, when Nowell entered Cecil's household as a [[tutor]] to his ward, [[Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kiernan|first=Kevin S.|title=Pride and Prodigies: Studies in the Monsters of the \"Beowulf\"-Manuscript.Andy Orchard|journal=Speculum|volume=73 |issue=3 |year=1998 |pages=879\u2013881 |jstor=2887546|doi=10.2307/2887546}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest extant reference to the first foliation of the Nowell Codex was made sometime between 1628 and 1650 by [[Franciscus Junius (the younger)]].<ref name=\"Beowulf and the Beowulf Manuscript\">{{cite book|last1=Kiernan|first1=Kevin|title=Beowulf and the Beowulf Manuscript|date=1981|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick |edition=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yv8cnwEACAAJ |accessdate=October 6, 2017|isbn=9780472084128}}</ref>{{rp|91}} The ownership of the codex before Nowell remains a mystery.<ref name=\"Beowulf and the Beowulf Manuscript\"/>{{rp|120}}\n\nThe Reverend [[Thomas Smith (scholar)|Thomas Smith]] (1638\u20131710) and [[Humfrey Wanley]] (1672\u20131726) both catalogued the Cotton library (in which the Nowell Codex was held). Smith's catalogue appeared in 1696, and Wanley's in 1705.{{sfn|Joy|2005|p=2}} The ''Beowulf'' manuscript itself is identified by name for the first time in an exchange of letters in 1700 between George Hickes, Wanley's assistant, and Wanley. In the letter to Wanley, Hickes responds to an apparent charge against Smith, made by Wanley, that Smith had failed to mention the ''Beowulf'' script when cataloguing Cotton MS. Vitellius A. XV. Hickes replies to Wanley \"I can find nothing yet of Beowulph.\"{{sfn|Joy|2005|p=24}} Kiernan theorised that Smith failed to mention the ''Beowulf'' manuscript because of his reliance on previous catalogues or because either he had no idea how to describe it or because it was temporarily out of the codex.{{sfn|Kiernan|1996|pp=73\u201374}}\n\nIt suffered damage in the Cotton Library fire at [[Ashburnham House]] in 1731. Since then, parts of the manuscript have crumbled along with many of the letters. Rebinding efforts, though saving the manuscript from much degeneration, have nonetheless covered up other letters of the poem, causing further loss. Kevin Kiernan, in preparing his electronic edition of the manuscript, used fibre-optic backlighting and ultraviolet lighting to reveal letters in the manuscript lost from binding, erasure, or ink blotting.<ref name=\"KiernanE\">{{cite web |last=Kiernan|first=Kevin |title=Electronic Beowulf 3.0 |date=16 January 2014 |url=http://ebeowulf.uky.edu/ |publisher=U of Kentucky |accessdate=19 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Writing ===\nThe ''Beowulf'' manuscript was transcribed from an original by two scribes, one of whom wrote the prose at the beginning of the manuscript and the first 1939 lines before breaking off in mid sentence. The first scribe made a point of carefully regularizing the spelling of the original document by using the common West Saxon language and by avoiding any archaic or dialectical features. The second scribe, who wrote the remainder, with a difference in handwriting noticeable after line 1939, seems to have written more vigorously and with less interest. As a result, the second scribe's script retains more archaic dialectic features, which allow modern scholars to ascribe the poem a cultural context.<ref name=\"Beowulf: Revised Edition\">{{cite book|last1=Swanton|first1=Michael|title=Beowulf: Revised Edition|date=1997|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester|isbn=978-0719051463|page=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Ks8nj3BGEQC|accessdate=14 September 2017}}</ref> While both scribes appear to have proofread their work, there are nevertheless many errors.<ref>{{cite news |author=Leonard Neidorf |year=2013 |journal=Anglo-Saxon England |volume=42 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=9099642&fileId=S0263675113000124 |pages=249\u201369 |title=Scribal errors of proper names in the ''Beowulf'' manuscript |doi=10.1017/s0263675113000124}}</ref> The second scribe was ultimately the more conservative copyist as he did not modify the spelling of the text as he wrote but copied what he saw in front of him. In the way that it is currently bound, the ''Beowulf'' manuscript is followed by the Old English poem ''[[Judith (poem)|Judith]]''. ''Judith'' was written by the same scribe that completed ''Beowulf'' as evidenced through similar writing style. Wormholes found in the last leaves of the ''Beowulf'' manuscript that are absent in the ''Judith'' manuscript suggest that at one point ''Beowulf'' ended the volume. The rubbed appearance of some leaves also suggest that the manuscript stood on a shelf unbound, as is known to have been the case with other Old English manuscripts.<ref name=\"Beowulf: Revised Edition\"/> From knowledge of books held in the library at [[Malmesbury Abbey]] and available as source works, as well as from the identification of certain words particular to the local dialect found in the text, the transcription may have taken place there.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lapidge |first=Michael |title=Anglo-Latin literature, 600\u2013899|url=https://archive.org/details/anglolatinlitera0000lapi_i2t2 |url-access=registration |publisher=Hambledon Press|location=London |year=1996|page=[https://archive.org/details/anglolatinlitera0000lapi_i2t2/page/299 299]|isbn=978-1-85285-011-1}}</ref>\n\n=== Debate over oral tradition ===\nThe question of whether ''Beowulf'' was passed down through [[oral tradition]] prior to its present [[manuscript]] form has been the subject of much debate, and involves more than simply the issue of its composition. Rather, given the implications of the theory of [[oral-formulaic composition]] and oral tradition, the question concerns how the poem is to be understood, and what sorts of interpretations are legitimate.\n\nScholarly discussion about ''Beowulf'' in the context of the oral tradition was extremely active throughout the 1960s and 1970s. The debate might be framed starkly as follows: on the one hand, we can hypothesise a poem put together from various tales concerning the hero (the Grendel episode, the Grendel's mother story, and the fire drake narrative). These fragments would have been told for many years in tradition, and learned by apprenticeship from one generation of illiterate poets to the next. The poem is composed orally and extemporaneously, and the archive of tradition on which it draws is oral, pagan, Germanic, heroic, and tribal. On the other hand, one might posit a poem which is composed by a literate scribe, who acquired literacy by way of learning Latin (and absorbing Latinate culture and ways of thinking), probably a monk and therefore profoundly Christian in outlook. On this view, the pagan references would be a sort of decorative archaising.<ref name=\"COLORING210-217\">{{Citation|last=Blackburn|first=FA|title=The Christian Coloring of Beowulf|journal=PMLA|volume=12|issue=2|pages=210\u201317|year=1897|doi=10.2307/456133|jstor=456133}}</ref><ref name=\"BENSON193-213\">{{Citation|last=Benson|first=Larry D|title=The Pagan Coloring of Beowulf|work=Old English Poetry: fifteen essays|pages=193\u2013213|year=1967|editor-last=Creed|editor-first=RP|place=Providence, [[Rhode Island]]|publisher=Brown University Press}}</ref> There is a third view that sees merit in both arguments above and attempts to bridge them, and so cannot be articulated as starkly as they can; it sees more than one [[Christianity]] and more than one attitude towards paganism at work in the poem; it sees the poem as initially the product of a literate Christian author with one foot in the pagan world and one in the Christian, himself perhaps a convert (or one whose forebears had been pagan), a poet who was conversant in both oral and literary composition and was capable of a masterful \"repurposing\" of poetry from the oral tradition.\n\nHowever, scholars such as D.K. Crowne have proposed the idea that the poem was passed down from reciter to reciter under the theory of [[oral-formulaic composition]], which hypothesises that epic poems were (at least to some extent) improvised by whoever was reciting them, and only much later written down. In his landmark work, ''[[The Singer of Tales]]'', [[Albert Lord]] refers to the work of [[Francis Peabody Magoun]] and others, saying \"the documentation is complete, thorough, and accurate. This exhaustive analysis is in itself sufficient to prove that ''Beowulf'' was composed orally.\"{{Sfn|Lord|1960|p=198}}\n\nExamination of ''Beowulf'' and other [[Old English literature]] for evidence of oral-formulaic composition has met with mixed response. While \"themes\" (inherited narrative subunits for representing familiar classes of event, such as the \"arming the hero\",{{Sfn|Zumthor|1984|pp=67\u201392}} or the particularly well-studied \"hero on the beach\" theme<ref>{{Citation|last=Crowne|first=DK|title=The Hero on the Beach: An Example of Composition by Theme in Anglo-Saxon Poetry|journal=Neuphilologische Mitteilungen|volume=61|year=1960}}</ref>) do exist across Anglo-Saxon and other Germanic works, some scholars conclude that Anglo-Saxon poetry is a mix of oral-formulaic and literate patterns, arguing that the poems both were composed on a word-by-word basis and followed larger formulae and patterns.<ref>{{Citation|last=Benson|first=Larry D|title=The Literary Character of Anglo-Saxon Formulaic Poetry|journal=Publications of the Modern Language Association|volume=81|issue=5|pages=334\u201341|year=1966|doi=10.2307/460821|jstor=460821}}</ref>\n\nLarry Benson argued that the interpretation of ''Beowulf'' as an entirely formulaic work diminishes the ability of the reader to analyse the poem in a unified manner, and with due attention to the poet's creativity. Instead, he proposed that other pieces of Germanic literature contain \"kernels of tradition\" from which ''Beowulf'' borrows and expands upon.<ref>{{Citation|last=Benson|first=Larry|title=The Interpretation of Narrative|pages=1\u201344|year=1970|contribution=The Originality of ''Beowulf''|place=Cambridge, MA|publisher=Harvard University Press}}</ref><ref name=\"Foley\">Foley, John M.

These are important in helping historians understand the ''Beowulf'' manuscript, as possible source-texts or influences would suggest time-frames of composition, geographic boundaries within which it could be composed, or range (both spatial and temporal) of influence (i.e. when it was \"popular\" and where its \"popularity\" took it).\n\nThere are Scandinavian sources, international folkloric sources, and Celtic sources.{{Efn|Ecclesiastical or biblical influences are only seen as adding \"Christian color\", in Andersson's survey. Old English sources hinges on the hypothesis that ''[[Genesis A]]'' predates ''Beowulf''.}}{{sfn|Andersson|1998|pp=125, 129}}\n\n===Scandinavian parallels and sources===\n19th century studies proposed that ''Beowulf'' was translated from a lost original Scandinavian work, but this idea was quickly abandoned. But Scandinavian works have continued to be studied as a possible source.{{sfn|Andersson|1998|pp=130\u2013131}} Proponents included Gregor Sarrazin writing in 1886 that an [[Old Norse]] original version of ''Beowulf'' must have existed,{{sfn|Andersson|1998|p=130}} but that view was later debunked by Carl Wilhelm von Sydow (1914) who pointed out that ''Beowulf'' is fundamentally [[Christianity|Christian]] and written at a time when any Norse tale would have most likely been [[paganism|pagan]].{{sfn|Andersson|1998|p=135}}<!--This bit relocated from \"Irish folktale\" content below-->\n\n====Grettis saga====\nThe epic's possible connection to ''[[Grettis saga]]'', an Icelandic [[Sagas of Icelanders|family saga]], was made early on by [[Gu\u00f0brandur Vigf\u00fasson]] (1878).{{sfn|Andersson|1998|pp=130\u201331}}\n\n''Grettis saga'' is a story about [[Grettir \u00c1smundarson]], a great-grandson of an Icelandic settler, and so cannot be as old as ''Beowulf''. [[Axel Olrik]] (1903) claimed that on the contrary, this saga was a reworking of ''Beowulf'', and others followed suit.{{sfn|Andersson|1998|p=130}}\n\nHowever, Friedrich Panzer (1910) wrote a thesis in which both ''Beowulf'' and ''Grettis saga'' drew from a common folkloric source, and this encouraged even a detractor such as W.

This theory of Homer's influence on ''Beowulf'' remained very prevalent in the 1920s, but started to die out in the following decade when a handful of critics stated that the two works were merely \"comparative literature\",{{sfn|Andersson|1998|p=138}} although Greek was known in late 7th century England: [[Bede]] states that [[Theodore of Tarsus]], a Greek, was appointed [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in 668, and he taught Greek.

There are, in round numbers, three hundred and sixty uncompounded verbs in ''Beowulf'', and forty of them are poetical words in the sense that they are unrecorded or rare in the existing prose writings. One hundred and fifty more occur with the prefix ''ge''- (reckoning a few found only in the past-participle), but of these one hundred occur also as simple verbs, and the prefix is employed to render a shade of meaning which was perfectly known and thoroughly familiar except in the latest Anglo-Saxon period. The nouns number sixteen hundred. Seven hundred of them, including those formed with prefixes, of which fifty (or considerably more than half) have ''ge''-, are simple nouns, at the highest reckoning not more than one-quarter is absent in prose. That this is due in some degree to accident is clear from the character of the words, and from the fact that several reappear and are common after the Norman Conquest.<ref>{{Citation |first=Ritchie |last=Girvan |title=Beowulf and the Seventh Century Language and Content |publisher=Methuen & Co |place=New Feller Lane: London EC4 |year=1971 |type=print}}</ref>\n\n== Form and metre ==\nAn Old English poem such as ''Beowulf'' is very different from modern poetry. Anglo-Saxon poets typically used [[alliterative verse]], a form of [[poetry|verse]] in which the first half of the line (the a-verse) is linked to the second half (the b-verse) through [[alliteration|similarity in initial sound]]. In addition, the two halves are divided by a [[caesura]]: \"Oft '''Sc'''yld '''Sc'''efing \\\\ '''sc'''ea\u00feena \u00fereatum\" (l. 4). This verse form maps stressed and unstressed syllables onto abstract entities known as metrical positions. There is no fixed number of beats per line: the first one cited has three (Oft SCYLD SCEFING, with [[Systems of scansion#Overview|ictus]] on the suffix -ING) whereas the second has two (SCEA\u00feena \u00deREATum).\n\nThe poet has a choice of [[epithets]] or formulae to use in order to fulfil the alliteration. When speaking or reading Old English poetry, it is important to remember for alliterative purposes that many of the letters are not pronounced in the same way as in [[modern English]]. The letter {{angbr|h}}, for example, is always pronounced (''Hro\u00f0gar'': {{IPA-ang|\u02c8hro\u00f0gar|}}), and the digraph {{angbr|cg}} is pronounced {{IPA-ang|d\u0292|}}, as in the word ''edge''. Both {{angbr|f}} and {{angbr|s}} vary in pronunciation depending on their phonetic environment. Between vowels or [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] consonants, they are voiced, sounding like modern {{angbr|v}} and {{angbr|z}}, respectively. Otherwise they are unvoiced, like modern {{angbr|f}} in ''fat'' and {{angbr|s}} in ''sat''. Some letters which are no longer found in modern English, such as thorn, {{angbr|\u00fe}}, and eth, {{angbr|\u00f0}} \u2013 representing both pronunciations of modern English {{angbr|th}}, as {{IPAc-en|\u03b8}} in ''thing'' and {{IPAc-en|\u00f0}} ''this'' \u2013 are used extensively both in the original manuscript and in modern English editions. The voicing of these characters echoes that of {{angbr|f}} and {{angbr|s}}. Both are voiced (as in ''this'') between other voiced sounds: ''o\u00f0er'', ''la\u00feleas'', ''su\u00feern''. Otherwise they are unvoiced (as in ''thing''): ''\u00feunor'', ''su\u00f0'', ''so\u00fef\u00e6st''.\n\n[[Kenning]]s are also a significant technique in ''Beowulf''. They are evocative poetic descriptions of everyday things, often created to fill the alliterative requirements of the metre. For example, a poet might call the sea the \"swan-road\" or the \"whale-road\"; a king might be called a \"ring-giver.\" There are many kennings in ''Beowulf'', and the device is typical of much of classic poetry in Old English, which is heavily formulaic. The poem also makes extensive use of [[elision|elided]] [[metaphor]]s.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Greenblatt|editor1-first=Stephen|editor2-last=Abrams|editor2-first=Meyer Howard|editor1-link=Beowulf|title=The Norton Anthology of English Literature|date=2006|publisher=W.

''Beowulf'' thus depicts a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic warrior society]], in which the relationship between the lord of the region and those who served under him was of paramount importance.<ref name=\"Leyerle\">{{cite book |last=Leyerle |first=John |editor-last =Fulk |editor-first=Robert Dennis |title=Interpretations of Beowulf: A Critical Anthology |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_sU0bTfcIjYC&pg=PA155 |accessdate =17 August 2013|year=1991|publisher=Indiana UP|isbn=978-0-253-20639-8 |pages=146\u201367|chapter=The Interlace Structure of Beowulf}}</ref>\n\nIn terms of the relationship between characters in ''Beowulf'' to God, one might recall the substantial amount of paganism that is present throughout the work. Literary critics such as [[Fred C. Robinson]] argue that the ''Beowulf'' poet tries to send a message to readers during the Anglo-Saxon time period regarding the state of Christianity in their own time. Robinson argues that the intensified religious aspects of the Anglo-Saxon period inherently shape the way in which the poet alludes to paganism as presented in ''Beowulf''. The poet calls on Anglo-Saxon readers to recognize the imperfect aspects of their supposed Christian lifestyles. In other words, the poet is referencing their \"Anglo-Saxon Heathenism.\" In terms of the characters of the epic itself, Robinson argues that readers are \"impressed\" by the courageous acts of Beowulf and the speeches of Hrothgar (181). But one is ultimately left to feel sorry for both men as they are fully detached from supposed \"Christian truth\" (181). The relationship between the characters of ''Beowulf'', and the overall message of the poet, regarding their relationship with God is debated among readers and literary critics alike.\n\nAt the same time, Richard North argues that the ''Beowulf'' poet interpreted \"Danish myths in Christian form\" (as the poem would have served as a form of entertainment for a Christian audience), and states: \"As yet we are no closer to finding out why the first audience of ''Beowulf'' liked to hear stories about people routinely classified as damned. This question is pressing, given... that Anglo-Saxons saw the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] as '{{linktext|heathen}}s' rather than as foreigners.\"{{Sfn|North|2006|p=195}} [[Grendel's mother]] and [[Grendel]] are described as descendants of Cain, a fact which some scholars link to the Cain tradition.<ref>{{Citation |last=Williams |first=David |title=Cain and Beowulf: A Study in Secular Allegory |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=1982}}</ref>\n\nOther scholars disagree, however, as to the meaning and nature of the poem: is it a Christian work set in a Germanic pagan context? The question suggests that the conversion from the Germanic pagan beliefs to Christian ones was a prolonged and gradual process over several centuries, and it remains unclear the ultimate nature of the poem's message in respect to religious belief at the time it was written. Robert F. Yeager notes the facts that form the basis for these questions:\n\n{{Quote |That the scribes of Cotton Vitellius A.XV were Christian beyond doubt, and it is equally sure that Beowulf was composed in a Christianised England since conversion took place in the sixth and seventh centuries. The only Biblical references in Beowulf are to the Old Testament, and Christ is never mentioned. The poem is set in pagan times, and none of the characters is demonstrably Christian. In fact, when we are told what anyone in the poem believes, we learn that they are pagans. Beowulf's own beliefs are not expressed explicitly. He offers eloquent prayers to a higher power, addressing himself to the \"Father Almighty\" or the \"Wielder of All.\" Were those the prayers of a pagan who used phrases the Christians subsequently appropriated? Or, did the poem's author intend to see Beowulf as a Christian Ur-hero, symbolically refulgent with Christian virtues?<ref name=\"nhum\">{{cite web |last=Yeager |first=Robert F |publisher=National Endowment For The Humanities |accessdate=2 October 2007 |url=http://www.neh.gov/news/humanities/1999-03/yeager.html |title=Why Read Beowulf? |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930202351/http://www.neh.gov/news/humanities/1999-03/yeager.html |archive-date=30 September 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>}}\n\nThe location of the composition of the poem is also intensely disputed. In 1914, [[F.W. Moorman]], the first professor of English Language at [[University of Leeds]], claimed that ''Beowulf'' was composed in Yorkshire,<ref>F. W. Moorman, 'English Place Names and the Teutonic Sagas,'in Oliver Elton (ed.), ''English Association Essays and Studies,'' vol. 5 (Oxford: Clarendon, 1914) pp. 75ff</ref> but E. Talbot Donaldson claims that it was probably composed more than twelve hundred years ago, during the first half of the eighth century, and that the writer was a native of what was then called West Mercia, located in the Western Midlands of England. However, the late tenth-century manuscript \"which alone preserves the poem\" originated in the kingdom of the [[Wessex|West Saxons]] \u2013 as it is more commonly known.<ref name=\" Tuso, F.

Greenfield]] has suggested that references to the human body throughout ''Beowulf'' emphasise the relative position of [[Thegn|thanes]] to their lord. He argues that the term \"shoulder-companion\" could refer to both a physical arm as well as a thane (Aeschere) who was very valuable to his lord (Hrothgar). With Aeschere's death, Hrothgar turns to Beowulf as his new \"arm.\"{{Sfn|Greenfield|1989|p=59}} Also, Greenfield argues the foot is used for the opposite effect, only appearing four times in the poem.

The band went on hiatus in 2006 and reunited in 2010; since then, they have performed live occasionally despite having not released any new material since the ''[[Mezmerize (album)|Mezmerize]]'' and ''[[Hypnotize (album)|Hypnotize]]'' albums in 2005. System of a Down has sold over 40 million records worldwide, while two of their singles \"[[Aerials (song)|Aerials]]\" and \"[[Hypnotize (System of a Down song)|Hypnotize]]\" reached number one on ''Billboard''{{'}}s [[Alternative Songs]] chart.\n\nEach individual member enjoy chocolate chip cookies.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Soil (1992\u201394) ===\nSerj Tankian and Daron Malakian attended [[Rose and Alex Pilibos Armenian School]] as children, although due to their eight-year age difference they did not meet until 1992 while working on separate projects at the same recording studio.<ref>Meyers, Ben. ''System Of A Down: Right Here In Hollywood'' (2007), p.&nbsp;14.</ref> They formed a band named ''Soil'' with Tankian on vocals and keyboards, Malakian on vocals and guitar, Dave Hakopyan (who later played in [[The Apex Theory]]/[[Mt. Helium]]) on bass and Domingo \"Dingo\" Laranio on drums. The band hired Shavo Odadjian (another Rose and Alex Pilibos alumnus) as manager, although he eventually joined Soil as rhythm guitarist. In 1994, after only one live show at the Roxy and one jam session recording, Hakopyan and Laranio left the band.\n\n=== Demo tapes and signing (1994\u201397) ===\nAfter Soil split up, Tankian, Odadjian, and Malakian formed a new band, System of a Down. The group took its name from a poem that Malakian had written titled \"Victims of a Down\".<ref name=\"blogs.myspace.com\">{{cite web |title=OnTroniK: System of a Down Information |url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=512654515&blogId=526325472 |access-date=July 18, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100220180824/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=512654515&blogId=526325472 |archive-date=February 20, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The word \"victims\" was changed to \"system\" because Odadjian believed that it would appeal to a much wider audience and also because the group wanted their records to be alphabetically shelved closer to their musical heroes, [[Slayer]]. Odadjian switched from guitar to bass and passed on his managerial duties to [[Velvet Hammer Music and Management Group]] and its founder David \"Beno\" Benveniste.<ref>{{cite web |title=Interview With David 'Beno' Benveniste |work=lamusicblog.com |date=March 13, 2011 |url=http://lamusicblog.com/2011/03/industry-profile/interview-with-beno-of-velvet-hammer |accessdate=August 8, 2012}}</ref> The band recruited drummer [[Ontronik Khachaturian|Ontronik \"Andy\" Khachaturian]], an old school friend of Malakian and Odadjian, who had played with Malakian in a band called Snowblind during their teens.<ref name=\"blogs.myspace.com\" />\n\nIn early 1995, System played as \"Soil\" at the Cafe Club Fais Do-Do, a nightclub in [[Los Angeles]]. Shortly after the event, System of a Down made what is known as ''Untitled 1995 Demo Tape'', which was not commercially released but appeared on file sharing networks around the time of the band's success with ''[[Toxicity (album)|Toxicity]]'' about six years later. ''Demo Tape 2'' was released in 1996. At the beginning of 1997, System of a Down recorded their final publicly released demo tape, ''Demo Tape 3''. In mid-1997, drummer Khachaturian left the band because of a hand injury (he subsequently co-founded The Apex Theory, which included former Soil bassist Dave Hakopyan).<ref name=\"blogs.myspace.com\" /> Khachaturian was replaced by [[John Dolmayan]].\n\nThe band's first official release of a professionally recorded song was on a collection called ''Hye Enk'' (\"we're Armenian\" in English), an [[Armenian Genocide]] recognition compilation, in 1997. Soon after playing at notable Hollywood clubs such as the [[Whisky-A-Go-Go]] and [[Viper Room]] the band caught famed producer [[Rick Rubin]]'s attention who asked them to keep in touch with him. Showing great interest, the group recorded ''Demo Tape 4'' near the end of 1997, specifically to be sent to [[Record label|record companies]]. Rubin signed the group to his [[American Recordings (record label)|American/Columbia Records]], and System of a Down began to record in Rubin's studio with engineer [[Sylvia Massy]], laying down tracks that would eventually be released on their debut album.\n\nAlso in 1997, the group won the Best Signed Band Award from the Rock City Awards.<ref name=\"rc_awards_97\">{{cite web |title=Rock City Awards 1997 |work=rockcitynews.com |url=http://www.rockcitynews.com/awards/ballot97.html |accessdate=July 25, 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Self-titled album (1998\u20132000) ===\nIn June 1998, System of a Down released their debut album, ''[[System of a Down (album)|System of a Down]]''. They enjoyed moderate success as their first singles \"[[Sugar (System of a Down song)|Sugar]]\" and \"[[Spiders (System of a Down song)|Spiders]]\" became radio favorites and the music videos for both songs were frequently aired on MTV. After the release of the album, the band toured extensively, opening for Slayer and [[Metallica]] before making their way to the second stage of [[Ozzfest]]. Following Ozzfest, they toured with [[Fear Factory]] and [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]] before headlining the [[Sno-Core Tour]] with [[Puya (band)|Puya]], [[Mr. Bungle]], The Cat and Incubus providing support.\n\nIn November 1998, System of a Down appeared on [[South Park]]'s ''[[Chef Aid: The South Park Album|Chef Aid]]'' album, providing the music for the song \"Will They Die 4 You?\" Near the end of the song Tankian can be heard saying, \"Why must we kill our own kind?\" a line that would later be used in the song \"Boom!\" Although System of a Down is credited on the album, South Park character [[Chef (South Park)|Chef]] does not introduce them as he does every other artist featured on the record.\n\nSystem of a Down's former drummer, Ontronik Khachaturian, briefly reunited with the band at a show at [[The Troubadour (Los Angeles)|The Troubadour]] in 1999, filling in on vocals for an ill Tankian.<ref name=\"blogs.myspace.com\" /> In 2000, the band contributed their cover of the [[Black Sabbath]] song \"[[Snowblind (Black Sabbath song)|Snowblind]]\" to the Black Sabbath tribute album ''[[Nativity in Black 2]].''\n\n=== ''Toxicity'' and ''Steal This Album!'' (2001\u201303) ===\n[[File:Daron Malakian 1.jpg|thumb|left|Guitarist [[Daron Malakian]] met Serj Tankian for the first time in 1993 before forming the band a year later.]]\nOn September 3, 2001, System of a Down had planned on launching their second album at a free concert in Hollywood as a \"thank you\" to fans. The concert, which was to be held in a parking lot, was set up to accommodate 3,500 people; however, an estimated 7,000 to 10,000 fans showed up. Because of the large excess number of fans, the performance was cancelled by police officers just before the group took the stage. No announcement was made that the concert had been cancelled. Fans waited for more than an hour for the group to appear, but when a banner hanging at the back of the stage that read \"System of a Down\" was removed by security, the audience rushed the stage, destroying all the band's touring gear (approximately $30,000 worth of equipment) and began to riot, throwing rocks at police, breaking windows, and knocking over portable toilets. The riot lasted six hours, during which six arrests were made. The band's manager, David \"Beno\" Benveniste, later said that the riot could have been avoided if the group had been permitted to perform or had they been allowed to make a statement at the concert regarding the cancellation.

Even with the controversy surrounding \"Chop Suey!\" (which earned a Grammy nomination), System of a Down still received constant airplay in the United States throughout late 2001 and 2002 with \"Toxicity\" and \"[[Aerials (song)|Aerials]]\". In May 2006, [[VH1]] listed \"Toxicity\" in the number 14 slot in the ''40 Greatest Metal Songs''.\n\nIn 2001, the band went on tour with [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]] throughout the United States and Mexico. Following a performance in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Odadjian was allegedly harassed, ethnically intimidated, and was physically assaulted by security guards backstage, who then dragged him out of the venue. Odadjian received medical attention from police and later filed a suit against the security company.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1470460/20030310/system_of_a_down.jhtml|title=System Of A Down Bassist Sues Security Team For Humiliating Him In Front Of Fans|first=Gil|last=Kaufman|date=March 10, 2003 |publisher=MTV |accessdate=July 18, 2010}}</ref> Despite the incident, the tour was a success and System of a Down and Slipknot went on the Pledge of Allegiance Tour with [[Rammstein]] in 2001.\n\nIn late 2001, unreleased tracks from the ''Toxicity'' sessions made their way onto the internet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glendalehigh.com/malakian.html|title=The Daron Malakian Interview|author=Mike Lancaster|date=March 28, 2003|publisher=Glendale High School Newspaper-the Explosion|access-date=July 26, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716081821/http://www.glendalehigh.com/malakian.html|archive-date=July 16, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> This collection of tracks was dubbed ''Toxicity II'' by fans. The group released a statement that the tracks were unfinished material and subsequently released the final versions of the songs as their third album, ''[[Steal This Album!]]'', which was released in November 2002. ''Steal This Album!'' resembled a burnable CD that was marked with a felt-tip marker. 50,000 special copies of the album with different CD designs were also released, each designed by a different member of the band. The name of the album is a reference to [[Abbie Hoffman]]'s counter-culture book, ''[[Steal This Book]]'' as well as a message to those who leaked the songs onto the internet. The song \"[[Innervision]]\" was released as a promo single and received constant airplay on alternative radio. A video for \"Boom!\" was filmed with director [[Michael Moore]] as a protest against the [[War in Iraq]].\n\n=== ''Mezmerize'', ''Hypnotize'' and separation (2004\u201306) ===\n[[File:Serj Tankian.jpg|thumb|[[Serj Tankian]] has gained a reputation for his large vocal range along with his unusual delivery.]]\nBetween 2004 and 2005, the group recorded the follow-up to ''Steal This Album!'', a double album, which they released as separate installments six months apart from each other. The releases notably included album cover artwork by Malakian's father, Vartan Malakian, and were designed to connect the two separate album covers. The first album, ''[[Mezmerize (album)|Mezmerize]],'' was released on May 17, 2005 to favorable reviews by critics. It debuted at No. 1 in the United States, Canada, Australia and all around the world, making it System of A Down's second No. 1 album. First week sales rocketed to over 800,000 copies worldwide. The Grammy Award-winning single \"[[B.Y.O.B. (song)|B.Y.O.B.]]\", which questions the integrity of military recruiting in America, worked its way up the Billboard Modern Rock and Mainstream Rock charts. The next single, \"[[Question!]]\" was released with Shavo Odadjian co-directing the music video. Following the release of ''Mezmerize,'' the band toured extensively throughout the United States and Canada with [[The Mars Volta]] and [[Bad Acid Trip]] supporting.\n\nThe second part of the double album, ''[[Hypnotize (album)|Hypnotize]],'' was released on November 22, 2005. Like ''[[Mezmerize (album)|Mezmerize]],'' it debuted at No. 1 in the US, making System of a Down, along with [[The Beatles]], [[Guns N' Roses]], and rappers [[2Pac]] and [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]], the only artists to ever have two studio albums debut at No. 1 in the same year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1516656/system-of-a-down-make-it-a-double-with-chart-topping-hypnotize/|title=System Of A Down Make It A Double With Chart-Topping Hypnotize|work=MTV News|access-date=2018-03-05|language=en}}</ref> In February 2006, System of a Down won the Grammy for Best Hard Rock Performance for \"[[B.Y.O.B. (song)|B.Y.O.B.]]\", beating out other established artists such as [[Nine Inch Nails]] and [[Robert Plant]]. Their second single off the Hypnotize album, \"[[Lonely Day]]\" was released in March in the United States. System of a Down released \"[[Kill Rock 'N Roll]]\" and \"[[Vicinity of Obscenity]]\" as their next [[Promotional recording|promo]] singles. It is of note that the latter and former of which was also an Itunes EP<ref>https://music.apple.com/ca/album/vicinity-of-obscenity-lonely-day-ep/271424729</ref> containing not only a collaboration song with [[Wu-Tang Clan]], but also a cover of \"Snowblind\" originally by [[Black Sabbath]], and \"Metro\" by Berlin. System of a Down headlined [[Ozzfest]] 2006 in cities where tour founder [[Ozzy Osbourne]] opted not to appear or was not playing on the main stage (with the exception of the show at Randall's Island, where Ozzy Osbourne headlined the second stage before System of a Down's performance that night).\n\nWhereas on System of a Down's previous albums most of the lyrics were written and sung by Tankian and the music was co-written by Tankian and Malakian (and sometimes Odadjian), much of the music and lyrics on ''Mezmerize''/''Hypnotize'' were written by Malakian who also took on a much more dominant role as vocalist on both albums, often leaving Tankian providing keyboards and backing vocals.\n\nSystem of a Down's song \"[[Lonely Day]]\" was nominated for Best Hard Rock Performance in the [[49th Annual Grammy Awards|49th Grammy Awards]] in 2007, but lost to \"[[Woman (Wolfmother song)|Woman]]\" by [[Wolfmother]].\n\nMay 2006 saw the UK publication of a biography of the band entitled ''System of a Down: Right Here in Hollywood'' by writer [[Ben Myers]]. It was published in the US in 2007 through [[The Disinformation Company]]. Also in 2006, concert footage and interviews with the band concerning the importance of helping create awareness and recognition of the [[Armenian Genocide]] were featured in the film ''[[Screamers (2006 film)|Screamers]],'' directed by [[Carla Garapedian]]. An interview with Tankian's grandfather, a survivor of the Genocide, was also included in the film as well as Tankian's and Dolmayan's meeting with (then) Speaker of the House [[Dennis Hastert]] during which the two musicians campaigned for the United States government's official recognition of the Genocide. Footage of Tankian and Dolmayan marching with protesters outside the Turkish embassy in Washington D.C. was also used in ''Screamers''.\n\nIn May also, the band announced they were going on hiatus. Malakian confirmed the break would probably last a few years, which Odadjian specified as a minimum of three years in an interview with ''Guitar'' magazine. He told MTV, \"We're not breaking up. If that was the case, we wouldn't be doing this Ozzfest. We're going to take a very long break after Ozzfest and do our own things. We've done System for over ten years, and I think it's healthy to take some rest.\"<ref>{{Cite news  |last=Harris |first=Chris |date=May 3, 2006 |title=System of a Down Aren't Breaking Up\u2014They're Going on Hiatus|work=MTV News |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1530066/20060503/system_of_a_down.jhtml |accessdate=February 2, 2009}}</ref> System of a Down's final performance before their separation took place on August 13, 2006 in [[West Palm Beach]], Florida. \"Tonight will be the last show we play for a long time together,\" Malakian told the crowd during Sunday's last performance. \"We'll be back.

After one [[Scars on Broadway (album)|self-titled album]] the project became dormant and Dolmayan left the band. However, the band released their long-awaited [[Dictator (album)|sophomore album]] in 2018, under the name Daron Malakian and Scars On Broadway. Dolmayan, alongside working with Scars on Broadway, formed his own band, Indicator, as well as opened Torpedo Comics, an online comic book store. Odadjian pursued his project with [[RZA]] of [[Wu-Tang Clan]], a hip-hop group named [[Achozen|AcHoZeN]], worked on his urSESSION website/record label, and performed as a member of funk legend [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]]'s backing band. Tankian opted for solo career and released his debut solo album ''[[Elect the Dead]]'' in the autumn of 2007.

System of a Down has been nominated for four [[Grammy Awards]], and their song \"[[B.Y.O.B. (song)|B.Y.O.B.]]\" won a [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance]] in 2006. The band went on hiatus in 2006 and reunited in 2010; since then, they have performed live occasionally despite having not released any new material since the ''[[Mezmerize (album)|Mezmerize]]'' and ''[[Hypnotize (album)|Hypnotize]]'' albums in 2005. System of a Down has sold over 40 million records worldwide, while two of their singles \"[[Aerials (song)|Aerials]]\" and \"[[Hypnotize (System of a Down song)|Hypnotize]]\" reached number one on ''Billboard''{{'}}s [[Alternative Songs]] chart.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Soil (1992\u201394) ===\nSerj Tankian and Daron Malakian attended [[Rose and Alex Pilibos Armenian School]] as children, although due to their eight-year age difference they did not meet until 1992 while working on separate projects at the same recording studio.<ref>Meyers, Ben. ''System Of A Down: Right Here In Hollywood'' (2007), p.&nbsp;14.</ref> They formed a band named ''Soil'' with Tankian on vocals and keyboards, Malakian on vocals and guitar, Dave Hakopyan (who later played in [[The Apex Theory]]/[[Mt. Helium]]) on bass and Domingo \"Dingo\" Laranio on drums. The band hired Shavo Odadjian (another Rose and Alex Pilibos alumnus) as manager, although he eventually joined Soil as rhythm guitarist. In 1994, after only one live show at the Roxy and one jam session recording, Hakopyan and Laranio left the band.\n\n=== Demo tapes and signing (1994\u201397) ===\nAfter Soil split up, Tankian, Odadjian, and Malakian formed a new band, System of a Down. The group took its name from a poem that Malakian had written titled \"Victims of a Down\".<ref name=\"blogs.myspace.com\">{{cite web |title=OnTroniK: System of a Down Information |url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=512654515&blogId=526325472 |access-date=July 18, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100220180824/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=512654515&blogId=526325472 |archive-date=February 20, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The word \"victims\" was changed to \"system\" because Odadjian believed that it would appeal to a much wider audience and also because the group wanted their records to be alphabetically shelved closer to their musical heroes, [[Slayer]]. Odadjian switched from guitar to bass and passed on his managerial duties to [[Velvet Hammer Music and Management Group]] and its founder David \"Beno\" Benveniste.<ref>{{cite web |title=Interview With David 'Beno' Benveniste |work=lamusicblog.com |date=March 13, 2011 |url=http://lamusicblog.com/2011/03/industry-profile/interview-with-beno-of-velvet-hammer |accessdate=August 8, 2012}}</ref> The band recruited drummer [[Ontronik Khachaturian|Ontronik \"Andy\" Khachaturian]], an old school friend of Malakian and Odadjian, who had played with Malakian in a band called Snowblind during their teens.<ref name=\"blogs.myspace.com\" />\n\nIn early 1995, System played as \"Soil\" at the Cafe Club Fais Do-Do, a nightclub in [[Los Angeles]]. Shortly after the event, System of a Down made what is known as ''Untitled 1995 Demo Tape'', which was not commercially released but appeared on file sharing networks around the time of the band's success with ''[[Toxicity (album)|Toxicity]]'' about six years later. ''Demo Tape 2'' was released in 1996. At the beginning of 1997, System of a Down recorded their final publicly released demo tape, ''Demo Tape 3''. In mid-1997, drummer Khachaturian left the band because of a hand injury (he subsequently co-founded The Apex Theory, which included former Soil bassist Dave Hakopyan).<ref name=\"blogs.myspace.com\" /> Khachaturian was replaced by [[John Dolmayan]].\n\nThe band's first official release of a professionally recorded song was on a collection called ''Hye Enk'' (\"we're Armenian\" in English), an [[Armenian Genocide]] recognition compilation, in 1997. Soon after playing at notable Hollywood clubs such as the [[Whisky-A-Go-Go]] and [[Viper Room]] the band caught famed producer [[Rick Rubin]]'s attention who asked them to keep in touch with him. Showing great interest, the group recorded ''Demo Tape 4'' near the end of 1997, specifically to be sent to [[Record label|record companies]]. Rubin signed the group to his [[American Recordings (record label)|American/Columbia Records]], and System of a Down began to record in Rubin's studio with engineer [[Sylvia Massy]], laying down tracks that would eventually be released on their debut album.\n\nAlso in 1997, the group won the Best Signed Band Award from the Rock City Awards.<ref name=\"rc_awards_97\">{{cite web |title=Rock City Awards 1997 |work=rockcitynews.com |url=http://www.rockcitynews.com/awards/ballot97.html |accessdate=July 25, 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Self-titled album (1998\u20132000) ===\nIn June 1998, System of a Down released their debut album, ''[[System of a Down (album)|System of a Down]]''. They enjoyed moderate success as their first singles \"[[Sugar (System of a Down song)|Sugar]]\" and \"[[Spiders (System of a Down song)|Spiders]]\" became radio favorites and the music videos for both songs were frequently aired on MTV. After the release of the album, the band toured extensively, opening for Slayer and [[Metallica]] before making their way to the second stage of [[Ozzfest]]. Following Ozzfest, they toured with [[Fear Factory]] and [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]] before headlining the [[Sno-Core Tour]] with [[Puya (band)|Puya]], [[Mr. Bungle]], The Cat and Incubus providing support.\n\nIn November 1998, System of a Down appeared on [[South Park]]'s ''[[Chef Aid: The South Park Album|Chef Aid]]'' album, providing the music for the song \"Will They Die 4 You?\" Near the end of the song Tankian can be heard saying, \"Why must we kill our own kind?\" a line that would later be used in the song \"Boom!\" Although System of a Down is credited on the album, South Park character [[Chef (South Park)|Chef]] does not introduce them as he does every other artist featured on the record.\n\nSystem of a Down's former drummer, Ontronik Khachaturian, briefly reunited with the band at a show at [[The Troubadour (Los Angeles)|The Troubadour]] in 1999, filling in on vocals for an ill Tankian.<ref name=\"blogs.myspace.com\" /> In 2000, the band contributed their cover of the [[Black Sabbath]] song \"[[Snowblind (Black Sabbath song)|Snowblind]]\" to the Black Sabbath tribute album ''[[Nativity in Black 2]].''\n\n=== ''Toxicity'' and ''Steal This Album!'' (2001\u201303) ===\n[[File:Daron Malakian 1.jpg|thumb|left|Guitarist [[Daron Malakian]] met Serj Tankian for the first time in 1993 before forming the band a year later.]]\nOn September 3, 2001, System of a Down had planned on launching their second album at a free concert in Hollywood as a \"thank you\" to fans. The concert, which was to be held in a parking lot, was set up to accommodate 3,500 people; however, an estimated 7,000 to 10,000 fans showed up. Because of the large excess number of fans, the performance was cancelled by police officers just before the group took the stage. No announcement was made that the concert had been cancelled. Fans waited for more than an hour for the group to appear, but when a banner hanging at the back of the stage that read \"System of a Down\" was removed by security, the audience rushed the stage, destroying all the band's touring gear (approximately $30,000 worth of equipment) and began to riot, throwing rocks at police, breaking windows, and knocking over portable toilets. The riot lasted six hours, during which six arrests were made. The band's manager, David \"Beno\" Benveniste, later said that the riot could have been avoided if the group had been permitted to perform or had they been allowed to make a statement at the concert regarding the cancellation.

Even with the controversy surrounding \"Chop Suey!\" (which earned a Grammy nomination), System of a Down still received constant airplay in the United States throughout late 2001 and 2002 with \"Toxicity\" and \"[[Aerials (song)|Aerials]]\". In May 2006, [[VH1]] listed \"Toxicity\" in the number 14 slot in the ''40 Greatest Metal Songs''.\n\nIn 2001, the band went on tour with [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]] throughout the United States and Mexico. Following a performance in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Odadjian was allegedly harassed, ethnically intimidated, and was physically assaulted by security guards backstage, who then dragged him out of the venue. Odadjian received medical attention from police and later filed a suit against the security company.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1470460/20030310/system_of_a_down.jhtml|title=System Of A Down Bassist Sues Security Team For Humiliating Him In Front Of Fans|first=Gil|last=Kaufman|date=March 10, 2003 |publisher=MTV |accessdate=July 18, 2010}}</ref> Despite the incident, the tour was a success and System of a Down and Slipknot went on the Pledge of Allegiance Tour with [[Rammstein]] in 2001.\n\nIn late 2001, unreleased tracks from the ''Toxicity'' sessions made their way onto the internet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glendalehigh.com/malakian.html|title=The Daron Malakian Interview|author=Mike Lancaster|date=March 28, 2003|publisher=Glendale High School Newspaper-the Explosion|access-date=July 26, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716081821/http://www.glendalehigh.com/malakian.html|archive-date=July 16, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> This collection of tracks was dubbed ''Toxicity II'' by fans. The group released a statement that the tracks were unfinished material and subsequently released the final versions of the songs as their third album, ''[[Steal This Album!]]'', which was released in November 2002. ''Steal This Album!'' resembled a burnable CD that was marked with a felt-tip marker. 50,000 special copies of the album with different CD designs were also released, each designed by a different member of the band. The name of the album is a reference to [[Abbie Hoffman]]'s counter-culture book, ''[[Steal This Book]]'' as well as a message to those who leaked the songs onto the internet. The song \"[[Innervision]]\" was released as a promo single and received constant airplay on alternative radio. A video for \"Boom!\" was filmed with director [[Michael Moore]] as a protest against the [[War in Iraq]].\n\n=== ''Mezmerize'', ''Hypnotize'' and separation (2004\u201306) ===\n[[File:Serj Tankian.jpg|thumb|[[Serj Tankian]] has gained a reputation for his large vocal range along with his unusual delivery.]]\nBetween 2004 and 2005, the group recorded the follow-up to ''Steal This Album!'', a double album, which they released as separate installments six months apart from each other. The releases notably included album cover artwork by Malakian's father, Vartan Malakian, and were designed to connect the two separate album covers. The first album, ''[[Mezmerize (album)|Mezmerize]],'' was released on May 17, 2005 to favorable reviews by critics. It debuted at No. 1 in the United States, Canada, Australia and all around the world, making it System of A Down's second No. 1 album. First week sales rocketed to over 800,000 copies worldwide. The Grammy Award-winning single \"[[B.Y.O.B. (song)|B.Y.O.B.]]\", which questions the integrity of military recruiting in America, worked its way up the Billboard Modern Rock and Mainstream Rock charts. The next single, \"[[Question!]]\" was released with Shavo Odadjian co-directing the music video. Following the release of ''Mezmerize,'' the band toured extensively throughout the United States and Canada with [[The Mars Volta]] and [[Bad Acid Trip]] supporting.\n\nThe second part of the double album, ''[[Hypnotize (album)|Hypnotize]],'' was released on November 22, 2005. Like ''[[Mezmerize (album)|Mezmerize]],'' it debuted at No. 1 in the US, making System of a Down, along with [[The Beatles]], [[Guns N' Roses]], and rappers [[2Pac]] and [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]], the only artists to ever have two studio albums debut at No. 1 in the same year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1516656/system-of-a-down-make-it-a-double-with-chart-topping-hypnotize/|title=System Of A Down Make It A Double With Chart-Topping Hypnotize|work=MTV News|access-date=2018-03-05|language=en}}</ref> In February 2006, System of a Down won the Grammy for Best Hard Rock Performance for \"[[B.Y.O.B. (song)|B.Y.O.B.]]\", beating out other established artists such as [[Nine Inch Nails]] and [[Robert Plant]]. Their second single off the Hypnotize album, \"[[Lonely Day]]\" was released in March in the United States. System of a Down released \"[[Kill Rock 'N Roll]]\" and \"[[Vicinity of Obscenity]]\" as their next [[Promotional recording|promo]] singles. It is of note that the latter and former of which was also an Itunes EP<ref>https://music.apple.com/ca/album/vicinity-of-obscenity-lonely-day-ep/271424729</ref> containing not only a collaboration song with [[Wu-Tang Clan]], but also a cover of \"Snowblind\" originally by [[Black Sabbath]], and \"Metro\" by Berlin. System of a Down headlined [[Ozzfest]] 2006 in cities where tour founder [[Ozzy Osbourne]] opted not to appear or was not playing on the main stage (with the exception of the show at Randall's Island, where Ozzy Osbourne headlined the second stage before System of a Down's performance that night).\n\nWhereas on System of a Down's previous albums most of the lyrics were written and sung by Tankian and the music was co-written by Tankian and Malakian (and sometimes Odadjian), much of the music and lyrics on ''Mezmerize''/''Hypnotize'' were written by Malakian who also took on a much more dominant role as vocalist on both albums, often leaving Tankian providing keyboards and backing vocals.\n\nSystem of a Down's song \"[[Lonely Day]]\" was nominated for Best Hard Rock Performance in the [[49th Annual Grammy Awards|49th Grammy Awards]] in 2007, but lost to \"[[Woman (Wolfmother song)|Woman]]\" by [[Wolfmother]].\n\nMay 2006 saw the UK publication of a biography of the band entitled ''System of a Down: Right Here in Hollywood'' by writer [[Ben Myers]]. It was published in the US in 2007 through [[The Disinformation Company]]. Also in 2006, concert footage and interviews with the band concerning the importance of helping create awareness and recognition of the [[Armenian Genocide]] were featured in the film ''[[Screamers (2006 film)|Screamers]],'' directed by [[Carla Garapedian]]. An interview with Tankian's grandfather, a survivor of the Genocide, was also included in the film as well as Tankian's and Dolmayan's meeting with (then) Speaker of the House [[Dennis Hastert]] during which the two musicians campaigned for the United States government's official recognition of the Genocide. Footage of Tankian and Dolmayan marching with protesters outside the Turkish embassy in Washington D.C. was also used in ''Screamers''.\n\nIn May also, the band announced they were going on hiatus. Malakian confirmed the break would probably last a few years, which Odadjian specified as a minimum of three years in an interview with ''Guitar'' magazine. He told MTV, \"We're not breaking up. If that was the case, we wouldn't be doing this Ozzfest. We're going to take a very long break after Ozzfest and do our own things. We've done System for over ten years, and I think it's healthy to take some rest.\"<ref>{{Cite news  |last=Harris |first=Chris |date=May 3, 2006 |title=System of a Down Aren't Breaking Up\u2014They're Going on Hiatus|work=MTV News |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1530066/20060503/system_of_a_down.jhtml |accessdate=February 2, 2009}}</ref> System of a Down's final performance before their separation took place on August 13, 2006 in [[West Palm Beach]], Florida. \"Tonight will be the last show we play for a long time together,\" Malakian told the crowd during Sunday's last performance. \"We'll be back.

After one [[Scars on Broadway (album)|self-titled album]] the project became dormant and Dolmayan left the band. However, the band released their long-awaited [[Dictator (album)|sophomore album]] in 2018, under the name Daron Malakian and Scars On Broadway. Dolmayan, alongside working with Scars on Broadway, formed his own band, Indicator, as well as opened Torpedo Comics, an online comic book store. Odadjian pursued his project with [[RZA]] of [[Wu-Tang Clan]], a hip-hop group named [[Achozen|AcHoZeN]], worked on his urSESSION website/record label, and performed as a member of funk legend [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]]'s backing band. Tankian opted for solo career and released his debut solo album ''[[Elect the Dead]]'' in the autumn of 2007.

{"title_page": "Motets by Johann Sebastian Bach, discography", "text_new": "This article includes a list of commercial recordings of the [[Motet (Bach)|motets]] of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]. Bach motets have often been recorded as a set (typically comprising the six motets catalogued as BWV{{nbsp}}225-230).{{efn|\"BWV\" is [[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis]], a thematic catalogue of Bach's works.}}  However, other motets are attributed to Bach and there is some doubt about the authorship of [[Lobet den Herrn, alle Heiden, BWV 230|''Lobet den Herrn, alle Heiden'', BWV 230]], one of the {{abbr|BWV|Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis (catalogue of Bach's works)}} \"six\".\n\nA single CD can contain the set of six motets plus other works. For example, [[Maasaki Suzuki]]'s 2009 recording on [[BIS Records|BIS]] includes [[O Jesu Christ, meins Lebens Licht, BWV 118|''O Jesu Christ, meins Lebens Licht'', BWV 118]] (which at one time was categorised as a cantata) and [[Ich lasse dich nicht, BWV Anh. 159|''Ich lasse dich nicht'', BWV Anh. 159]] (the authorship of which has been disputed).<ref name=\"BIS\">{{Cite web |url=https://bis.se/conductors/suzuki-masaaki/bach-motets |title=Bach Motets |website=bis.se (BIS Records) |access-date=6 April 2020}}</ref> The motets chosen for a particular recording can reflect the way the balance of opinion changes regarding the status of a particular work. This appears to be the case with the two sets by [[John Eliot Gardiner]] conducting the [[Monteverdi Choir]].
