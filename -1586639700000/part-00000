At the culmination of this workshop and their discussions, they created a written manifesto to coin the term De'VIA and detail its characteristics.<ref name=\"Curriculum\" /> The following list contains the artists that participated in this workshop and signed the manifesto:\n* Betty G.

Some common motifs in De'VIA works include:\n*Eyes\n*Hands\n\nThese motifs can be analyzed in different ways throughout the pieces in which they appear, however the four most prevalent motifs are the eyes, the hands, the ears, and the mouth. In most cases, these symbols are used to communicate a message concerning the communication of Deaf people among each other or in interactions within the hearing world.<ref name=\"Durr\" />\n\nSome notable De'VIA pieces highlight the eyes by either scratching them out or switching them with other parts of the face.

Because of that lack of access, the child is treated like an animal which has limited communication.

Foreign minister [[Camillo Benso di Cavour]] seized the opportunity to denounce Austrian political and military interference in the [[Italian Peninsula]], which he said was stifling the wish of Italians to choose their government.\n\n== Aftermath ==\n[[File:Black sea crimean war.jpg|thumb|350px|Picture of the territory affected by the Congress.

Its threats to enter the war ended the war.\n\n== Congress ==\n[[File:Congr\u00e8s de Paris, 1856.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[\u00c9pinal print]] of the sovereigns of Europe during the Congress of Paris, 1856]]\nThe great powers in Europe were [[France]], [[Great Britain]], [[Russia]], [[Austria]], and [[Prussia]]. Also at the Congress were representatives of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Sardinia-Piedmont]].<ref name=\"Britannica\"/><ref name=Congress>\"Congress of Paris\". The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-Paris-Co.html. 2008</ref> They assembled soon after 1 February 1856, when Russia accepted the first set of peace terms after Austria threatened to enter the war. It is also notable that the meeting took place in Paris, at the conclusion of the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|1855 Exposition Universelle]] <ref name=\"Good\"/>\n\nThe Congress of Paris worked out the final terms from 25 February to 30 March 1856, when the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]] was signed on 30 March 1856 with Russia on one side and France, Great Britain, Ottoman Turkey and Sardinia-Piedmont on the other.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> at the [[Quai d'Orsay]].<ref name=Barchard>Barchard, David. SETTING THE WORLD TO RIGHTS. http://www.cornucopia.net/highlights35.html. 2008</ref>\n\nOne of the representatives who attended the Congress of Paris on behalf of the Ottoman Empire was [[Mehmed Emin \u00c2li Pasha]], who was the Ottoman Empire's [[grand vizier]].<ref name=\"Barchard\"/> Russia was represented by Prince [[Orlov]] and Baron [[Brunnov]]. Britain sent [[Henry Wellesley, 1st Earl Cowley|Lord Cowley]], its ambassador to France.\n\nAlthough other congresses, such as the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814), spread questions and issues for different committees to resolve, the Congress of Paris resolved everything at the same time.<ref>{{Cite EB1911|first=Walter Alison |last=Phillips|wstitle=Congress|volume=6|page=938}}</ref>\n\nA significant diplomatic victory was scored by tiny [[Sardinia-Piedmont]] although it was not yet considered a European great power by being granted a seat by French Emperor [[Napoleon III]], mostly for having sent an expeditionary corps of 18,000 men to fight against Russia, but also possibly because of the intrigues of the very attractive [[Virginia Oldoini|Countess of Castiglione]], who had caught his attention. Foreign minister [[Camillo Benso di Cavour]] seized the opportunity to denounce Austrian political and military interference in the [[Italian Peninsula]], which he said was stifling the wish of Italians to choose their government.\n\n== Aftermath ==\n[[File:Black sea crimean war.jpg|thumb|350px|Picture of the territory affected by the Congress. In light green, to the left, is the area of the Danubian Principalities (Wallachia and Moldavia). In light green is the border of southern Bessarabia, which was transferred from Russia to [[Moldavia]] between the [[Danube River]] and Moldavia.]]\nThe Congress resulted in a pledge by all powers to jointly maintain \"the integrity of the Ottoman Empire\", thus guaranteeing its independence.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>\n\nAlso, Russia gave up the left bank of the mouth of the Danube River, including part of [[Bessarabia]],<ref name=\"Congress\"/> to [[Moldavia]], as well as its claim to the special protection of Christians in the Ottoman Empire. Moldavia and [[Wallachia]], which together would become [[Romania]] in 1858, along with Serbia, were recognized as quasi-independent self-governing principalities under protection of the other European powers. The Ottoman sultan agreed, in return, to help to improve the status of the Christian subjects in his empire.<ref name=\"Congress\"/>\n\nThe territories of Russia and the Ottoman Empire were restored to their prewar boundaries.<ref name=\"Congress\"/> The [[Black Sea]] was neutralized and so that no warships were allowed to enter, but it was open to all other nations.<ref name=\"Congress\"/> It also opened the [[Danube River]] for shipping from all nations.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>\n\nTurkish historians still express dissatisfaction: \"Although Ottoman Empire was on the side of winners, the Porte also lost the right to have a navy in the Black Sea together with the Russia. Put differently, the Empire had become a part of the European Concert, but not an actor in the European balance of power. Thus it was not recognized as a great power that could claim compensation in case of territorial gain by another member of the system\".<ref name=\"Candan Badem 1856 p.403\">Candan Badem, The Ottoman Crimean War (1853-1856). Leiden-Boston.1970.p.403</ref>\n\nThe conditions of the Paris Congress collapsed after the defeat of France in the 1870-1871 [[French-Prussian War]]. After the surrender of the fortress of Metz, when France lost hope of winning the war, Russia announced its refusal to comply with the terms of the treaty. \nRussian Foreign Minister [[Alexander Gorchakov]] denounced the treaty's Black Sea clauses on October 31, 1870, which was documented by the 1871 Treaty of London.\n\nSome of the rules and agreements would be changed by the [[Congress of Berlin]].<ref name=\"Congress\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{cite book | author=[[R.R.
