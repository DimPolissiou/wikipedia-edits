Little\n* Potter Burns\n* Francis J. Varieur\n* Henry J. Winters\n\n===Catholic schools===\nThe [[Quality Hill Historic District (Pawtucket, Rhode Island)|Quality Hill]] section of Pawtucket is home to [[St. Raphael Academy]]. It is a private college preparatory school founded on the basis of St. John the Baptist de la Salle. \"Saints\" is a small school consisting of roughly 500 students with a student to teacher ratio of about 15:2. The \"Saints and Lady Saints\" are very successful in sports including baseball, football, basketball, and softball. [[St. Raphael Academy]] is a rival of [[William E. Tolman High School|William E. Tolman]]. They took part in a Thanksgiving Day football game that was played in McCoy Stadium for over 70 years. This game is no longer played, as William E. Tolman now competes annually against its fellow Pawtucket public high school Charles E. Shea, rather than against St. Raphael Academy, a private Catholic high school.\n\nPawtucket was home to [[Bishop Keough Regional High School|Bishop Keough High School]], a small all-girls catholic high school in the Fairlawn neighborhood.\n\nThe city also has three Catholic elementary schools:  St. Cecilia School, St. Teresa School and Woodlawn Catholic Regional School.\n\n==Infrastructure==\n\n===Transportation===\n[[Amtrak]]'s [[Northeast Corridor]] and the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|MBTA]]'s [[Providence/Stoughton Line]] run through Pawtucket, though there is no stop for either in the city. Train service at the [[Pawtucket/Central Falls train station]] terminated in 1959. Recently{{when|date=May 2011}} there have been discussions to have the \"T\" stop in Pawtucket at the old train station (which would be substantially refurbished) or at a platform elsewhere on the line. Federal funding has been provided for preliminary planning of a MBTA station in the city, with a request for proposals expected in early 2011.<ref>[http://www.dot.ri.gov/engineering/intermod/index.asp#ComRail ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020003436/http://www.dot.ri.gov/engineering/intermod/index.asp#ComRail |date=October 20, 2011 }}</ref>  Commuters can board MBTA trains at the [[South Attleboro (MBTA station)|South Attleboro]] stop, off Newport Avenue just over the state line. The MBTA operates a layover facility in Pawtucket for trains on the Providence/Stoughton Line where the trains are kept overnight. The closest Amtrak station to Pawtucket is [[Providence Station]].\n\nPublic bus transportation is available in the city. [[Rhode Island Public Transit Authority|RIPTA]] operates a hub in downtown Pawtucket with routes to various parts of the city and to parts of nearby towns. Riders can also access RIPTA buses to Providence at the downtown hub on the Smithfield Avenue (#53) and Beverage Hill (#78) routes; as well as on either the R-Line (Broad-North Main) Rapid Service route or #1 (Hope/Eddy) Key Corridor route. The # 1 (Hope/Eddy) Key Corridor route provides service from the Downtown Pawtucket hub north to the MBTA Station at South Attleboro, Mass. and south to [[T.F. Green Airport]] in Warwick. At [[Kennedy Plaza]], Providence's hub, riders can access routes to most parts of the state.\n\n===Highways and roads===\n[[Interstate 95 in Rhode Island|Interstate 95]] and [[U.S. Route 1 in Rhode Island|U.S. 1]] also traverse the western part of Pawtucket. Some of the slowest posted speeds on I-95 are in the city due to the \"S-curves\" near downtown. To preserve certain buildings in the city, planners snaked I-95, creating sharp bends in the highway.\n\n===Downtown Circulator===\nPawtucket's Downtown Circulator was a one-way loop through downtown; it is similar to British concepts of [[ring road]]s. A similar concept was also tried in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]].\n\nThe circulator used East Avenue, High Street, Summer Street, Goff Avenue, Dexter Street and Park Place West. Each half of the Circulator carried one direction of [[U.S. Route 1 in Rhode Island|U.S. 1]]; sections also carried westbound [[RI 15]] and northbound [[RI 114]]. It was signed with a big \"C\" on overhead signs.\n\nThe circulator is no longer signed, though the road configuration remains. Providence's Downtown Ring Roads have suffered a similar fate.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"250\">\nFile:Pawtucket Circulator sign.jpg|The only remaining sign\nFile:Pawtucket Circulator map.png|Map\nFile:Pawtucket Circulator overhead.jpg|Former overhead signs, with C sign at left\n</gallery>\n\n==Economy==\n[[Hasbro]], a [[Fortune 1000]] toy and game making company, is headquartered in Pawtucket.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/companies/hasbro/|title=Hasbro on the Forbes Just Companies List|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-01-19|language=en}}</ref>\n\nMany Healthcare, Retail and Insurance companies are headquartered in Pawtucket.\n<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dlt.ri.gov/lmi/es202/largestemp/|title=Large Employers in Pawtucket List|work=Labor Market Information|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en}}\n</ref>\n\nFox Point Pickles, a pickling company, is headquartered in Pawtucket.\n\n== Notable people ==\n{{Main|List of people from Pawtucket, Rhode Island}}\n\n==In popular culture==\n* Pawtucket has been frequently referenced in the cartoon series ''[[Family Guy]]'', specifically the \"Pawtucket Brewery\", [[Peter Griffin]]'s place of work from [[Family Guy (season 4)|Season 4]] onwards, the character \"Pawtucket Pat\" and the beer \"Pawtucket Patriot\", though no brewery existed in the real Pawtucket when the show first made references to them. The toy company Peter Griffin worked for early in the series was called the Happy-Go-Lucky Toy Co, the name a loose parody based on the name of the [[Hasbro]] toy company based in Pawtucket. In general, there is a strong argument Pawtucket is the basis for the town of Quahog on the show.\n*In the 1999 film ''[[Outside Providence (film)|Outside Providence]]'', the movie's main character, Tim Dunphy, grew up in Pawtucket.  Many different Pawtucket locations are seen in the movie, including the police station.\n* ''[[American Buffalo (film)|American Buffalo]]'', a 1996 film, was filmed in Pawtucket.\n* In December 1993, a character on the [[NBC]] sitcom [[Nurses (TV series)|''Nurses'']] called Pawtucket a pit.

Over the past decades various organizations have been active in continuing that support of the local arts community and beyond.\n\nIn January, 1999, Herb Weiss, of the Planning Department, was hired to oversee the City's newly created Arts District. Through the support of then Mayor James E. Doyle and Planning Department Michael Cassidy, Weiss brought significant recognition for Pawtucket-Arts oriented development strategy [https://pbn.com/pawtuckets-success-is-not-an-accident25768/].  Mayor Doyle and Arts Czar Weiss hired researcher Ann Galligan, of Northeastern University, to create an arts and cultural plan.

Bands that have performed or recorded here include [[Battles (band)|Battles]], [[Lightning Bolt (band)|Lightning Bolt]], [[Brown Bird]], and [[Fang Island]].\n\nThe success of the works was seen in nationwide publicity in publications such as New York Times [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/28/realestate/old-mills-remade-in-pawtucket-ri-with-art-as-their-product.html?], The Wall Street Journal [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303670804579232412520127176], Christian Scientist Monitor [https://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0928/p01s01-ussc.html].

Little\n* Potter Burns\n* Francis J. Varieur\n* Henry J. Winters\n\n===Catholic schools===\nThe [[Quality Hill Historic District (Pawtucket, Rhode Island)|Quality Hill]] section of Pawtucket is home to [[St. Raphael Academy]]. It is a private college preparatory school founded on the basis of St. John the Baptist de la Salle. \"Saints\" is a small school consisting of roughly 500 students with a student to teacher ratio of about 15:2. The \"Saints and Lady Saints\" are very successful in sports including baseball, football, basketball, and softball. [[St. Raphael Academy]] is a rival of [[William E. Tolman High School|William E. Tolman]]. They took part in a Thanksgiving Day football game that was played in McCoy Stadium for over 70 years. This game is no longer played, as William E. Tolman now competes annually against its fellow Pawtucket public high school Charles E. Shea, rather than against St. Raphael Academy, a private Catholic high school.\n\nPawtucket was home to [[Bishop Keough Regional High School|Bishop Keough High School]], a small all-girls catholic high school in the Fairlawn neighborhood.\n\nThe city also has three Catholic elementary schools:  St. Cecilia School, St. Teresa School and Woodlawn Catholic Regional School.\n\n==Infrastructure==\n\n===Transportation===\n[[Amtrak]]'s [[Northeast Corridor]] and the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|MBTA]]'s [[Providence/Stoughton Line]] run through Pawtucket, though there is no stop for either in the city. Train service at the [[Pawtucket/Central Falls train station]] terminated in 1959. Recently{{when|date=May 2011}} there have been discussions to have the \"T\" stop in Pawtucket at the old train station (which would be substantially refurbished) or at a platform elsewhere on the line. Federal funding has been provided for preliminary planning of a MBTA station in the city, with a request for proposals expected in early 2011.<ref>[http://www.dot.ri.gov/engineering/intermod/index.asp#ComRail ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020003436/http://www.dot.ri.gov/engineering/intermod/index.asp#ComRail |date=October 20, 2011 }}</ref>  Commuters can board MBTA trains at the [[South Attleboro (MBTA station)|South Attleboro]] stop, off Newport Avenue just over the state line. The MBTA operates a layover facility in Pawtucket for trains on the Providence/Stoughton Line where the trains are kept overnight. The closest Amtrak station to Pawtucket is [[Providence Station]].\n\nPublic bus transportation is available in the city. [[Rhode Island Public Transit Authority|RIPTA]] operates a hub in downtown Pawtucket with routes to various parts of the city and to parts of nearby towns. Riders can also access RIPTA buses to Providence at the downtown hub on the Smithfield Avenue (#53) and Beverage Hill (#78) routes; as well as on either the R-Line (Broad-North Main) Rapid Service route or #1 (Hope/Eddy) Key Corridor route. The # 1 (Hope/Eddy) Key Corridor route provides service from the Downtown Pawtucket hub north to the MBTA Station at South Attleboro, Mass. and south to [[T.F. Green Airport]] in Warwick. At [[Kennedy Plaza]], Providence's hub, riders can access routes to most parts of the state.\n\n===Highways and roads===\n[[Interstate 95 in Rhode Island|Interstate 95]] and [[U.S. Route 1 in Rhode Island|U.S. 1]] also traverse the western part of Pawtucket. Some of the slowest posted speeds on I-95 are in the city due to the \"S-curves\" near downtown. To preserve certain buildings in the city, planners snaked I-95, creating sharp bends in the highway.\n\n===Downtown Circulator===\nPawtucket's Downtown Circulator was a one-way loop through downtown; it is similar to British concepts of [[ring road]]s. A similar concept was also tried in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]].\n\nThe circulator used East Avenue, High Street, Summer Street, Goff Avenue, Dexter Street and Park Place West. Each half of the Circulator carried one direction of [[U.S. Route 1 in Rhode Island|U.S. 1]]; sections also carried westbound [[RI 15]] and northbound [[RI 114]]. It was signed with a big \"C\" on overhead signs.\n\nThe circulator is no longer signed, though the road configuration remains. Providence's Downtown Ring Roads have suffered a similar fate.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"250\">\nFile:Pawtucket Circulator sign.jpg|The only remaining sign\nFile:Pawtucket Circulator map.png|Map\nFile:Pawtucket Circulator overhead.jpg|Former overhead signs, with C sign at left\n</gallery>\n\n==Economy==\n[[Hasbro]], a [[Fortune 1000]] toy and game making company, is headquartered in Pawtucket.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/companies/hasbro/|title=Hasbro on the Forbes Just Companies List|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-01-19|language=en}}</ref>\n\nMany Healthcare, Retail and Insurance companies are headquartered in Pawtucket.\n<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dlt.ri.gov/lmi/es202/largestemp/|title=Large Employers in Pawtucket List|work=Labor Market Information|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en}}\n</ref>\n\nFox Point Pickles, a pickling company, is headquartered in Pawtucket.\n\n== Notable people ==\n{{Main|List of people from Pawtucket, Rhode Island}}\n\n==In popular culture==\n* Pawtucket has been frequently referenced in the cartoon series ''[[Family Guy]]'', specifically the \"Pawtucket Brewery\", [[Peter Griffin]]'s place of work from [[Family Guy (season 4)|Season 4]] onwards, the character \"Pawtucket Pat\" and the beer \"Pawtucket Patriot\", though no brewery existed in the real Pawtucket when the show first made references to them. The toy company Peter Griffin worked for early in the series was called the Happy-Go-Lucky Toy Co, the name a loose parody based on the name of the [[Hasbro]] toy company based in Pawtucket. In general, there is a strong argument Pawtucket is the basis for the town of Quahog on the show.\n*In the 1999 film ''[[Outside Providence (film)|Outside Providence]]'', the movie's main character, Tim Dunphy, grew up in Pawtucket.

It is the largest party represented in the [[Supreme People's Assembly]] and coexists ''[[de jure]]'' with two other legal parties making up the [[Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland]]. However, these minor parties are completely subservient to the WPK,{{sfn|Cha|Hwang|2009|p=214}} and must accept the WPK's \"[[vanguard party|leading role]]\" as a condition of their existence.\n\nWPK was founded in 1949 with the merger of the [[Workers' Party of North Korea]] and the [[Workers' Party of South Korea]]. The WPK also controls the [[Korean People's Army]]. WPK (and all of the other parties in the DPRK) remains illegal in [[South Korea]] under South Korea's own [[National Security Act (South Korea)|National Security Act]] and is sanctioned by [[Australia]], the [[European Union]], the [[United Nations]] and the [[United States]].<ref>[https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/03/16/executive-order-blocking-property-government-north-korea-and-workers Executive Order -- Blocking Property of the Government of North Korea and the Workers' Party of Korea, and Prohibiting Certain Transactions with Respect to North Korea]</ref>\n\nThe WPK is organized according to the [[Ten Principles for the Establishment of a Monolithic Ideological System|Monolithic Ideological System]] and the [[Great Leader (concept)|Great Leader]], a system and theory conceived by [[Kim Yong-ju]] and [[Kim Jong-il]]. The highest body of the WPK is formally the Congress, but in practice a Congress occurs infrequently. Between 1980 and 2016, there were no congresses held. Although the WPK is organizationally similar to [[Communist party|communist parties]], in practice it is far less institutionalized and informal politics plays a larger role than usual. Institutions such as the [[Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea|Central Committee]], the [[Executive Policy Bureau of the Workers' Party of Korea|Executive Policy Bureau]], the [[Central Military Commission of the Workers' Party of Korea|Central Military Commission]] (CMC), the [[Politburo of the Workers' Party of Korea|Politburo]] and the Politburo's [[Presidium of the Politburo of the Workers' Party of Korea|Presidium]] have much less power than that formally bestowed on them by [[Charter of the Workers' Party of Korea|the party's charter]], which is little more than a nominal document. [[Kim Jong-un]] is the current WPK leader, serving as [[Chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea|Chairman]] and CMC chairman.\n\nThe WPK is committed to ''[[Juche]]'', an ideology which has been described as a combination of [[collectivism]] and [[Korean nationalism|nationalism]]; and at the 4th Conference (held in 2012), the party charter was amended to state that [[Kimilsungism\u2013Kimjongilism]] was \"the only guiding idea of the party\". At the 3rd Conference (held in 2010), the WPK removed a sentence from the preamble which expressed the party's commitment \"to building a [[pure communism|communist society]]\", replacing it with a new adherence to ''[[Songun]]'', the [[Militarism|\"military-first\" policies]] developed by Kim Jong-il. The 2009 revision had already removed all references to communism. Party ideology has recently focused on perceived [[Imperialism|imperialist]] enemies of the party and state; and on legitimizing the [[Kim dynasty (North Korea)|Kim family]]'s dominance of the political system. Before the rise of ''Juche'' and later ''Songun'', the party was committed to [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist thought]] as well, with its importance becoming greatly diminished over time.\n\nThe party's emblem is an adaptation of the communist [[hammer and sickle]], with a traditional [[Korean calligraphy]] brush.

All the policies and lines of our Party emanate from the Juche idea and they embody this idea.|source=\u2014Kim Il-sung, when asked by a Japanese interviewer to define ''[[Juche]]''{{sfn|Oh|Hassig|2000|p=18}}}}\n''Juche''{{'}}s primary objective for North Korea is political, economic and military independence.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=105}} Kim Il-sung, in his \"Let Us Defend the Revolutionary Spirit of Independence, Self-Reliance, and Self-defense More Thoroughly in All Fields of State Activities\" speech to the [[Supreme People's Assembly]] in 1967, summarized ''Juche'':{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=105}} <blockquote>The government of the republic will implement with all consistency the line of independence, self-sustenance, and self-defense to consolidate the political independence of the country (''chaju''), build up more solidly the foundations of an independent national economy capable of insuring the complete unification, independence, and prosperity of our nation (''charip'') and increasing the country's defense capabilities, so as to safeguard the security of the fatherland reliably by our own force (''chawi''), by splendidly embodying our Party's idea of Juche in all fields.\"{{sfn|Lee|2003|pp=105\u2013106}}</blockquote>\n\nThe principle of political independence known as ''chaju'' is one of ''Juche''{{'}}s central tenets.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=106}} ''Juche'' stresses equality and mutual respect among nations, asserting that every state has the right of self-determination.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=106}} In practice, the beliefs in self-determination and equal sovereignty have turned North Korea into a [[hermit kingdom]].{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=106}} As interpreted by the WPK, yielding to foreign pressure or intervention would violate ''chaju'' and threaten the country's ability to defend its sovereignty.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=106}} This may explain why Kim Jong-il believed that the Korean revolution would fail if North Korea became dependent on a foreign entity.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=106}} In relations with fellow socialist countries China and the Soviet Union Kim Il-sung urged cooperation, mutual support and dependence, acknowledging that it was important for North Korea to learn from other countries.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=106}} Despite this, he abhorred the idea that North Korea could (or should) depend on the two nations and did not want to dogmatically follow their example.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=106}} Kim Il-sung said that the WPK needed to \"resolutely repudiate the tendency to swallow things of others undigested or imitate them mechanically\", attributing the success of North Korea on the WPK's independence in implementing policies.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=106}} To ensure North Korean independence, official pronouncements stressed the need for the people to unite under the WPK and the Great Leader.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=106}}\n\nEconomic independence (''charip'') is seen as the material basis of ''chaju''.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=106}} One of Kim Il-sung's greatest fears involved North Korean dependence on foreign aid; he believed it would threaten the country's ability to develop socialism, which only a state with a strong, independent economy could do.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=106}} ''Charip'' emphasizes an independent national economy based on [[heavy industry]]; this sector, in theory, would then drive the rest of the economy.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=106}} Kim Jong-il said:{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=107}}\n<blockquote>Building an independent national economy means building an economy which is free from dependence on others and which stands on its own feet, an economy which serves one\u2019s own people and develops on the strength of the resources of one\u2019s own country and by the efforts of one\u2019s people.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=107}}</blockquote>\n\nKim Il-sung considered military independence (''chawi'') crucial.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=107}} Acknowledging that North Korea might need military support in a war against [[imperialism|imperialist enemies]], he emphasized a domestic response and summed up the party's (and state's) attitude towards military confrontation: \"We do not want war, nor are we afraid of it, nor do we beg peace from the imperialists.\"{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=107}}\n\nAccording to ''Juche'', because of his [[consciousness]] man has ultimate control over himself and the ability to change the world.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=109}} This differs from classical Marxism, which believes that humans depend on their [[relations of production|relationship]] to the [[means of production]] more than on themselves.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=111}} The ''Juche'' view of a revolution led by a Great Leader, rather than a group of knowledgeable revolutionaries, is a break from [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's]] concept of a [[vanguard party]].{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=111}}\n\n===Nationalism===\n[[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] did not clarify the difference between state and law, focusing on class divisions within nations.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=139}} They argued that nation and law (as it existed then) would be overthrown and replaced by [[proletariat|proletarian rule]].{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=139}} This was the mainstream view of Soviet theoreticians during the 1920s; however, with Stalin at the helm in 1929 it was under attack.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=140}} He criticized [[Nikolai Bukharin]]'s position that the proletariat was hostile to the [[Marx's theory of the state|inclinations of the state]], arguing that since the state (the Soviet Union) was in transition from [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalism]] to [[Socialism (Marxism)|socialism]] the relationship between the state and the proletariat was harmonious.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=140}} By 1936, Stalin argued that the state would still exist if the Soviet Union reached the [[pure communism|communist mode of production]] if the socialist world was encircled by capitalist forces.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=140}} Kim Il-sung took this position to its logical conclusion, arguing that the state would exist after North Korea reached the communist mode of production until a future [[world revolution]].{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=140}} As long as capitalism survived, even if the socialist world predominated, North Korea could still be threatened by the restoration of capitalism.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=141}}\n\nThe revival of the term \"state\" in the Soviet Union under Stalin led to the revival of \"nation\" in North Korea under Kim Il-sung.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=141}} Despite official assertions that the Soviet Union was based on \"class\" rather than \"state\", the latter was revived during the 1930s.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=141}} In 1955 Kim Il-sung expressed a similar view in his speech, \"On Eliminating Dogmatism and Formalism and Establishing Juche in Ideological Work\":{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=141}} <blockquote>What we are doing now is not a revolution in some foreign country but our Korean revolution. Therefore, every ideological action must benefit the Korean revolution. To fulfill the Korean revolution, one should be perfectly cognizant of the history of our national struggle, of Korea's geography, and our customs.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=141}}</blockquote>\nFrom then on, he and the WPK stressed the roles of \"revolutionary tradition\" and Korea's cultural tradition in its revolution.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=141}} At party meetings, members and cadres learned about North Korea's national prestige and its coming rejuvenation.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=141}} Traditional customs were revived, to showcase Korean-ness.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=141}} By 1965, Kim Il-sung claimed that if communists continued opposing [[Individualism|individuality]] and [[sovereign state|sovereignty]], the movement would be threatened by [[dogmatism]] and [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionism]].{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=142}} He criticized those communists who, he believed, subscribed to \"national [[nihilism]] by praising all things foreign and vilifying all things national\" and tried to impose foreign models on their own country.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=142}} By the 1960s, ''Juche'' was a full-fledged ideology calling for a distinct path for North Korean socialist construction and non-interference in its affairs; however, a decade later it was defined as a system whose \"fundamental principle was the realization of sovereignty\".{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=142}}\n\nAlthough WPK theoreticians were initially hostile towards the terms \"nation\" and \"nationalism\" because of the influence of the Stalinist definition of \"state\", by the 1970s their definition was changed from [[Marxism and the National Question|\"a stable, historically formed community of people based on common language, territory, economic life, and culture\"]] to include \"shared bloodline\".{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=142}} During the 1980s a common economic life was removed from the definition, with shared bloodline receiving increased emphasis.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=143}} With a democratic transition in South Korea and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the WPK revised the meaning of nationalism.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=143}} Previously defined in Stalinist terms as a bourgeois weapon to exploit the workers, nationalism changed from a [[reactionary]] to a [[progressivism|progressive]] idea.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=143}} Kim Il-sung differentiated \"nationalism\" from what he called \"genuine nationalism\"; while genuine nationalism was a progressive idea, nationalism remained reactionary:{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=143}}\n<blockquote>True nationalism (genuine nationalism) is similar to [[patriotism]]. Only a genuine patriot can become a devoted and true [[Proletarian internationalism|internationalist]]. In this sense, when I say communist, at the same time, I mean nationalist and internationalist.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=143}}</blockquote>\n\n====Allegations of xenophobia====\nDuring the 1960s the WPK began forcing ethnic Koreans to divorce their European spouses (who were primarily from the [[Eastern Bloc]]), with a high-ranking WPK official calling the marriages \"a crime against the Korean race\" and [[Eastern Bloc]] embassies in the country beginning to accuse the regime of [[fascism]].{{sfn|Becker|2005|p=66}} In May 1963, a Soviet diplomat described Kim Il-sung's political circle as a \"political [[Gestapo]]\".{{sfn|Becker|2005|p=66}} Similar remarks were made by other Eastern Bloc officials in North Korea, with the East German ambassador calling the policy \"Goebbelsian\" (a reference to [[Joseph Goebbels]], [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler's]] [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|minister of propaganda]]).{{sfn|Becker|2005|p=66}} Although this was said during a [[nadir]] in relations between North Korea and the Eastern Bloc, it illustrated a perception of racism in Kim Il-sung's policies.{{sfn|Becker|2005|p=66}}\n\nIn his book ''[[The Cleanest Race]]'' (2010), [[Brian Reynolds Myers]] dismisses the idea that ''Juche'' is North Korea's leading ideology. He views its public exaltation as designed to deceive foreigners; it exists to be praised rather than followed.<ref name=\"Rank\">{{cite news |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Korea/LD10Dg02.html |title=Lifting the cloak on North Korean secrecy: ''The Cleanest Race, How North Koreans See Themselves'' by B R Myers |first=Michael |last=Rank |date=10 April 2012 |accessdate=13 December 2012 |publisher=Asia Times}}</ref> Myers writes that ''Juche'' is a sham ideology, developed to extol Kim Il-sung as a political thinker comparable to [[Mao Zedong]].<ref name=\"3quarksdaily\">{{cite web |url=http://www.3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2010/04/immersion-in-propaganda-racebased-nationalism-and-the-unfigureoutable-vortex-of-juche-thought-colin-.html |title=Immersion in propaganda, race-based nationalism and the un-figure-outable vortex of Juche Thought: Colin Marshall talks to B.R.

It is the largest party represented in the [[Supreme People's Assembly]] and coexists ''[[de jure]]'' with two other legal parties making up the [[Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland]]. However, these minor parties are completely subservient to the WPK,{{sfn|Cha|Hwang|2009|p=214}} and must accept the WPK's \"[[vanguard party|leading role]]\" as a condition of their existence.\n\nWPK was founded in 1949 with the merger of the [[Workers' Party of North Korea]] and the [[Workers' Party of South Korea]]. The WPK also controls the [[Korean People's Army]]. WPK (and all of the other parties in the DPRK) remains illegal in [[South Korea]] under South Korea's own [[National Security Act (South Korea)|National Security Act]] and is sanctioned by [[Australia]], the [[European Union]], the [[United Nations]] and the [[United States]].<ref>[https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/03/16/executive-order-blocking-property-government-north-korea-and-workers Executive Order -- Blocking Property of the Government of North Korea and the Workers' Party of Korea, and Prohibiting Certain Transactions with Respect to North Korea]</ref>\n\nThe WPK is organized according to the [[Ten Principles for the Establishment of a Monolithic Ideological System|Monolithic Ideological System]] and the [[Great Leader (concept)|Great Leader]], a system and theory conceived by [[Kim Yong-ju]] and [[Kim Jong-il]]. The highest body of the WPK is formally the Congress, but in practice a Congress occurs infrequently. Between 1980 and 2016, there were no congresses held. Although the WPK is organizationally similar to [[Communist party|communist parties]], in practice it is far less institutionalized and informal politics plays a larger role than usual. Institutions such as the [[Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea|Central Committee]], the [[Executive Policy Bureau of the Workers' Party of Korea|Executive Policy Bureau]], the [[Central Military Commission of the Workers' Party of Korea|Central Military Commission]] (CMC), the [[Politburo of the Workers' Party of Korea|Politburo]] and the Politburo's [[Presidium of the Politburo of the Workers' Party of Korea|Presidium]] have much less power than that formally bestowed on them by [[Charter of the Workers' Party of Korea|the party's charter]], which is little more than a nominal document. [[Kim Jong-un]] is the current WPK leader, serving as [[Chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea|Chairman]] and CMC chairman.\n\nThe WPK is committed to ''[[Juche]]'', an ideology which has been described as a combination of [[collectivism]] and [[Korean nationalism|nationalism]]; and at the 4th Conference (held in 2012), the party charter was amended to state that [[Kimilsungism\u2013Kimjongilism]] was \"the only guiding idea of the party\". At the 3rd Conference (held in 2010), the WPK removed a sentence from the preamble which expressed the party's commitment \"to building a [[pure communism|communist society]]\", replacing it with a new adherence to ''[[Songun]]'', the [[Militarism|\"military-first\" policies]] developed by Kim Jong-il. The 2009 revision had already removed all references to communism. Party ideology has recently focused on perceived [[Imperialism|imperialist]] enemies of the party and state; and on legitimizing the [[Kim dynasty (North Korea)|Kim family]]'s dominance of the political system. Before the rise of ''Juche'' and later ''Songun'', the party was committed to [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist thought]] as well, with its importance becoming greatly diminished over time.\n\nThe party's emblem is an adaptation of the communist [[hammer and sickle]], with a traditional [[Korean calligraphy]] brush. The symbols represent the industrial workers (hammer), peasants (sickle) and intelligentsia (ink brush).\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of the Workers' Party of Korea}}\n{{Infobox Korean name\n|title      = '''Workers' Party of Korea'''\n|image      = Workers' Party of Korea.svg\n|caption    = \"Workers' Party of Korea\" in [[Hancha]] (top) and [[Chos\u014fn'g\u016dl]] (bottom) scripts\n|context    = north\n|hangul     = {{linktext|\uc870\uc120|\ub85c\ub3d9|\ub2f9}}, {{linktext|\ubd81\ud55c|\ub178\ub3d9|\ub2f9}}\n|hanja      = {{linktext|lang=ko-Hant|\u671d\u9bae|\u52de\u52d5|\u9ee8}}, {{linktext|lang=ko-Hant|\u5317\u97d3|\u52de\u52d5|\u9ee8}}\n|mr         = Chos\u014fn Rodongdang, Bukhan Nodongdang\n|rr         = Joseon Rodongdang, Pukhan Nodongdang\n|tablewidth = 288\n|fontcolor  = #FFFF00\n|color      = {{Workers' Party of Korea/meta/color}}\n}}\n\n===Founding and early years (1945\u20131953)===\nOn 13 October 1945, the {{ill|North Korean Bureau of the Communist Party of Korea|ko|\ubd81\uc870\uc120\uacf5\uc0b0\ub2f9}} (NKB\u2013CPK) was established,{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=20}} with [[Kim Yong-bom]] its first chairman.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=21}} However, the NKB\u2013CPK remained subordinate to the [[Communist Party of Korea|CPK]] Central Committee (headquartered in Seoul and headed by [[Pak Hon-yong]]).{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=22}} Two months later, at the 3rd Plenum of the NKB, Kim Yong-bom was replaced by [[Kim Il-sung]] (an event probably orchestrated by the Soviet Union).{{sfn|Lankov|2002|pp=21\u201322}} In spring 1946 the North Korean Bureau became the [[Communist Party of North Korea]], with Kim Il-sung its elected chairman.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|pp=28\u201329}} On 22 July 1946 Soviet authorities in North Korea established the [[Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland|United Democratic National Front]], a [[popular front]] led by the Communist Party of North Korea.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=29}} The Communist Party of North Korea soon merged with the [[New People's Party of Korea]], a party primarily composed of communists from China.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=29}} On 28 July 1946 a special commission of the two parties ratified the merger, and it became official the following day.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=31}} One month later (28\u201330 August 1946) the party held its [[1st Congress of the Workers' Party of North Korea|founding congress]], establishing the [[Workers' Party of North Korea]] (WPNK).{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=31}} The congress elected former leader of the New People's Party of Korea [[Kim Tu-bong]] as the first WPNK chairman, with Kim Il-sung its appointed deputy chairman.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=31}} However, despite his formal downgrade in the party's hierarchy Kim Il-sung remained its leader.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|pp=31\u201332}}\n\n[[File:Kim Il-sung and Pak Hon-yong, Baik Namun in Pyungyang.jpg|thumb|[[Kim Il-sung]] (left) with [[Pak Hon-yong]] in [[Pyongyang]], 1948]]\nParty control increased throughout the country after the congress.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|pp=33\u201340}} From 27\u201330 March 1948, the WPNK convened its [[2nd Congress of the Workers' Party of North Korea|2nd Congress]].{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=40}} While Kim Tu-bong was still the party's formal head, Kim Il-sung presented the main report to the congress.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=42}} In it he claimed that North Korea was \"a base of democracy\", in contrast to South Korea (which was, he believed, dictatorial).{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=42}} On 28 April 1948 a special session of the [[Supreme People's Assembly]] approved the constitution (proposed and written by WPNK cadres), which led to the official establishment of an independent North Korea.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=44}} It did not call for the establishment of an independent North Korea, but for a unified (communist) Korea; the capital of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) would be Seoul, not Pyongyang.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=45}} Kim Il-sung was the appointed head of government of the new state, with Kim Tu-bong heading the legislative branch.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=47}} A year later on 30 June 1949, the Workers' Party of Korea was created with the merger of the WPNK and the [[Workers' Party of South Korea]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://world.kbs.co.kr/english/event/nkorea_nuclear/general_03c.htm|title=KBS WORLD Radio|work=kbs.co.kr}}</ref>\n\nKim Il-sung was not the most ardent supporter of a military reunification of Korea; that role was played by the South Korean communists, headed by Pak Hon-yong.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=60}} After several meetings with [[Joseph Stalin]] (the [[List of leaders of the Soviet Union|leader of the Soviet Union]]), North Korea invaded South Korea on 25 June 1950\u2014and thus began the [[Korean War]].{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=61}} With American intervention in the war the DPRK nearly collapsed, but it was saved by Chinese intervention in the conflict.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=61}} The war had the effect of weakening Soviet influence over Kim Il-sung and the WPK.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=62}} Around this time, the main fault lines in early WPK politics were created. Four factions formed: domestic (a group of WPK cadres who had remained in Korea during Japanese rule), Soviet Koreans (Koreans sent from the Soviet Union), Yanan (Koreans from China) and guerrillas (Kim Il-sung's personal faction).{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=62}} However, Kim would be unable to further strengthen his position until the end of the war.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=62}}\n\n===Kim Il-sung's consolidation of power (1953\u20131980)===\n[[File:Mosaic Depicting Kim Il Sungs Homecoming, Pyongyang, North Korea (2907648510).jpg|thumb|left|Propaganda mosaic commemorating the triumphant homecoming of Kim Il-sung after he liberated Korea from Japan]]\nRelations worsened between the WPK and the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU) when Stalin's successor, [[Nikita Khrushchev]], began pursuing a policy of [[de-Stalinization]].{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=65}} During the [[Sino\u2013Soviet conflict]], an ideological conflict between the CPSU and the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), Kim Il-sung maneuvered between the two socialist superpowers; by doing so, he weakened their influence on the WPK.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=65}} By 1962 Kim Il-sung and the WPK favored the CPC over the CPSU in the ideological struggle, and \"for a few years North Korea almost unconditionally supported the Chinese position on all important issues.\"{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=65}} The primary conflict between the WPK and the CPSU during this period was that Kim Il-sung did not support the denunciation of [[Stalinism]] (including Stalin's [[cult of personality]]), the creation of a [[collective leadership]] and the theory of [[peaceful coexistence]] between the capitalist and socialist worlds.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=65}} Kim Il-sung believed peaceful coexistence synonymous with capitulation, and knew that de-Stalinization in North Korea would effectively end his unlimited power over the WPK.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=65}} The result of the souring of relations between the CPSU and the WPK was that the Soviet Union discontinued aid to North Korea.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=66}} As a result, several industries were on the brink of disaster; China was unwilling to increase aid to North Korea.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=66}} [[Mao Zedong]] began the [[Cultural Revolution]] shortly thereafter, an event criticized by the WPK as \"left-wing opportunism\" and a manifestation of the \"[[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] theory of a [[permanent revolution]].\"{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=66}} Relations towards the CPSU and the CPC stabilized during the 1960s, with the WPK making it clear it would remain neutral in the Sino\u2013Soviet conflict,{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=66}} thus resulting in the 1966 launch of the ''Juche'' program aimed at national self-determination at all levels. This, in turn, strengthened Kim Il-Sung's position in the WPK.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=66}}\n\nBeginning in the 1960s, Kim Il-sung's cult of personality reached new heights.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=70}} It had been no greater than Stalin's or Mao's until 1972, when [[Day of the Sun|his birthday]] on April 15 became the country's main [[Public holidays in North Korea|public holiday]] and statues of him began to be built nationwide.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=70}} Kim became known as \"Great Leader\", the \"Sun of the Nation\", \"The Iron All-Victorious General\" and \"Marshal of the All-Mighty Republic\" in WPK and state publications; official propaganda stated that \"burning loyalty to the leader\" was one of the main characteristics of any Korean.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=70}}\n\nKim Il-sung and his guerilla faction had purged the WPK of its opposing factions during the 1950s and the 1960s, to the dismay of both the CPC and the CPSU.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=62}} The domestic faction was the first to go (in 1953\u201355), followed by the Yan'an faction in 1957\u201358 and the Soviet Koreans (along with anyone else deemed unfaithful to the WPK leadership) in the 1957\u201362 purge.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|pp=62\u201363}} According to historian [[Andrei Lankov]], \"Kim Il-sung had become not only supreme, but also the omnipotent ruler of North Korea\u2014no longer merely 'first amongst equals', as had been the case in the late 1940s\".{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=63}} After purging his WPK opposition, Kim Il-sung consolidated his power base with [[nepotism]] and hereditary succession in the Kim family and the guerilla faction.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=72}} Beginning in the late 1980s, \"a high (and increasing) proportion of North Korean high officials have been sons of high officials.\"{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=72}} Since the 1960s, Kim Il-sung had appointed family members to positions of power.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=73}} By the early 1990s, a number of leading national offices were held by people in his family: [[Kang Song-san]] ([[Premier of North Korea|Premier]] of the [[Government of North Korea|Administrative Council]] and member of the WPK Secretariat), [[Pak Song-chol]] ([[Vice President of North Korea|Vice President]]), [[Hwang Jang-yop]] and [[Kim Chung-rin]] (members of the WPK Secretariat), [[Kim Yong-sun]] (Head of the [[International Department of the Workers' Party of Korea|WPK International Department]] and member of the WPK Secretariat), [[Kang Hui-won]] (Secretary of the [[Pyongyang Municipal Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea|WPK Pyongyang Municipal Committee]] and Deputy Premier of the Administrative Council), [[Kim Tal-hyon]] ([[Ministry of Foreign Trade (North Korea)|Minister of Foreign Trade]]), [[Kim Chan-ju]] ([[Ministry of Agriculture (North Korea)|Minister of Agriculture]] and Deputy Chairman of the Administrative Council) and [[Yang Hyong-sop]] (President of the [[Academy of Social Sciences (North Korea)|Academy of Social Sciences]] and chairman of the [[Supreme People's Assembly]]).{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=73}} These individuals were appointed solely because of their ties to the [[Kim dynasty (North Korea)|Kim family]], and presumably retain their positions as long as the Kim family controls the WPK and the country.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=73}} The reason for Kim's support of nepotism (his own and that of the guerrilla faction) can be explained by the fact that he did not want the [[nomenklatura|party bureaucracy]] to threaten his\u2014and his son's\u2014rule as it did in other socialist states.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=73}}\n\nIt was first generally believed by foreign observers that Kim Il-sung was planning for his brother, [[Kim Yong-ju]], to succeed him.{{sfn|Lee|1982|p=442}} Kim Yong-ju's authority gradually increased, until he became co-chairman of the North\u2013South Coordination Committee.{{sfn|Lee|1982|p=442}} From late 1972 to the [[6th Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea|6th WPK Congress]], Kim Yong-ju became an increasingly remote figure in the regime. At the 6th Congress he lost his Politburo and Central Committee seats,{{sfn|Lee|1982|p=442}} and rumors that Kim Il-sung had begun grooming Kim Jong-il in 1966 were confirmed.{{sfn|Lee|1982|p=442}} From 1974 to the 6th Congress, Kim Jong-il (called the \"Party centre\" by North Korean media) was the second most powerful man in North Korea.{{sfn|Lee|1982|p=442}} His selection was criticized, with his father accused of creating a dynasty or turning North Korea into a [[Feudalism|feudal state]].{{sfn|Lee|1982|p=434}}\n\n===Kim Jong-il's apprenticeship and rule (1980\u20132011)===\n[[File:Kim Jong il Portrait-2.jpg|thumb|Although [[Kim Jong-il]] headed the WPK with no pretense of following the party charter, it was revitalized at the 3rd Conference at the end of his rule]]\nWith Kim Jong-il's official appointment as [[heir apparent]] at the 6th Congress, power became more centralized in the Kim family.{{sfn|Buzo|1999|p=105}} WPK officials began to speak openly about his succession, and beginning in 1981 he began to participate in (and lead) tours.{{sfn|Buzo|1999|p=105}} In 1982 he was made a [[Hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] and wrote ''[[On the Juche Idea]]''.{{sfn|Buzo|1999|p=105}} While foreign observers believed that Kim Jong-il's appointment would increase participation by the younger generation, in ''On the Juche Idea'' he made it clear that his leadership would not mark the beginning of a new generation of leaders.{{sfn|Buzo|1999|pp=105\u2013106}} The WPK could not address the crisis facing Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il's leadership at home and abroad, in part because of the [[gerontocracy]] at the highest level of the WPK and the state.{{sfn|Buzo|1999|p=106}}\n\nWith the death of [[O Jin-u]] on 25 February 1995, Kim Jong-il became the sole remaining living member of the Presidium (the highest body of the WPK when the Politburo and the Central Committee are not in session).{{sfn|Gause|2011|p=7}} While no member list of the [[Central Military Commission of the Workers' Party of Korea|WPK Central Military Commission]] (CMC, the highest party organ on military affairs) was published from 1993 to 2010, there were clear signs of movement in the military hierarchy during 1995.{{sfn|Gause|2011|p=8}} For the WPK's 50th anniversary, Kim Jong-il initiated a reshuffling of the CMC (and the military leadership in general) to appease the old guard and younger officials.{{sfn|Gause|2011|p=8}} He did not reshuffle the WPK Central Committee or the government, however, and during the 1990s the changes to its membership were caused mostly by its members [[Death by natural causes|dying of natural causes]].{{sfn|Gause|2011|p=11}}\n\nBeginning in 1995, Kim Jong-il favored the military over the WPK and the state.{{sfn|Gause|2011|p=11}} Problems began to mount as an [[economic crisis]], coupled with a [[North Korean famine|famine]] in which at least half a million people died, weakened his control of the country.{{sfn|Gause|2011|pp=11\u201313}} Instead of recommending structural reforms Kim began to criticize the WPK's lack of control over the economy, lambasting its local and provincial branches for their inability to implement central-level instructions.{{sfn|Gause|2011|p=13}} At a speech celebrating the 50th anniversary of [[Kim Il-sung University]], he said: \"The reason why people are loyal to the instructions of the Central Committee is not because of party organizations and workers, but because of my authority.\"{{sfn|Gause|2011|p=13}} Kim Jong-il said that his father had told him to avoid economics, claiming that it was better left to experts. After this speech, the WPK's responsibility to control the economy was given to the Administrative Council (the central government).{{sfn|Gause|2011|p=13}} By late 1996 Kim Jong-il concluded that neither the WPK nor the central government could run the country, and began shifting control to the military.{{sfn|Gause|2011|p=15}}\n\n[[File:Party-Foundation-Monument.jpg|thumb|[[Monument to Party

Although the WPK claims to be [[socialist patriotism|socialist-patriotic]],{{sfn|Suh|1988|p=309}} some analysts claim its socialist patriotism would be more similar to [[bourgeois nationalism]]; the chief difference is that socialist patriotism is nationalism in a [[socialist state]].{{sfn|Suh|1988|pp=309\u2013310}} ''Juche'' developed as a reaction to foreign occupation, involvement and influence (primarily by the Chinese and Soviets) in North Korean affairs, and may be described \"as a normal and healthy reaction of the Korean people to the deprivation they suffered under foreign domination.\"{{sfn|Suh|1988|p=310}} However, there is nothing uniquely Marxist or Leninist in this reaction; the primary reason for its description as \"communist\" is that it occurred in a self-proclaimed socialist state.{{sfn|Suh|1988|p=310}} The WPK (and the North Korean leadership in general) have not explained in detail how their policies are Marxist, Leninist or communist; ''Juche'' is defined as \"Korean\", and the others as \"foreign\".{{sfn|Suh|1988|pp=310\u2013313}}\n\n====Basic tenets====\n{{quote box|width=25em|align=right|bgcolor=ivory|quote=You requested me to give a detailed explanation of the Juche idea.

he believed it would threaten the country's ability to develop socialism, which only a state with a strong, independent economy could do.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=106}} ''Charip'' emphasizes an independent national economy based on [[heavy industry]]; this sector, in theory, would then drive the rest of the economy.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=106}} Kim Jong-il said:{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=107}}\n<blockquote>Building an independent national economy means building an economy which is free from dependence on others and which stands on its own feet, an economy which serves one\u2019s own people and develops on the strength of the resources of one\u2019s own country and by the efforts of one\u2019s people.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=107}}</blockquote>\n\nKim Il-sung considered military independence (''chawi'') crucial.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=107}} Acknowledging that North Korea might need military support in a war against [[imperialism|imperialist enemies]], he emphasized a domestic response and summed up the party's (and state's) attitude towards military confrontation: \"We do not want war, nor are we afraid of it, nor do we beg peace from the imperialists.\"{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=107}}\n\nAccording to ''Juche'', because of his [[consciousness]] man has ultimate control over himself and the ability to change the world.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=109}} This differs from classical Marxism, which believes that humans depend on their [[relations of production|relationship]] to the [[means of production]] more than on themselves.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=111}} The ''Juche'' view of a revolution led by a Great Leader, rather than a group of knowledgeable revolutionaries, is a break from [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's]] concept of a [[vanguard party]].{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=111}}\n\n===Nationalism===\n[[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] did not clarify the difference between state and law, focusing on class divisions within nations.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=139}} They argued that nation and law (as it existed then) would be overthrown and replaced by [[proletariat|proletarian rule]].{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=139}} This was the mainstream view of Soviet theoreticians during the 1920s; however, with Stalin at the helm in 1929 it was under attack.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=140}} He criticized [[Nikolai Bukharin]]'s position that the proletariat was hostile to the [[Marx's theory of the state|inclinations of the state]], arguing that since the state (the Soviet Union) was in transition from [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalism]] to [[Socialism (Marxism)|socialism]] the relationship between the state and the proletariat was harmonious.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=140}} By 1936, Stalin argued that the state would still exist if the Soviet Union reached the [[pure communism|communist mode of production]] if the socialist world was encircled by capitalist forces.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=140}} Kim Il-sung took this position to its logical conclusion, arguing that the state would exist after North Korea reached the communist mode of production until a future [[world revolution]].{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=140}} As long as capitalism survived, even if the socialist world predominated, North Korea could still be threatened by the restoration of capitalism.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=141}}\n\nThe revival of the term \"state\" in the Soviet Union under Stalin led to the revival of \"nation\" in North Korea under Kim Il-sung.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=141}} Despite official assertions that the Soviet Union was based on \"class\" rather than \"state\", the latter was revived during the 1930s.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=141}} In 1955 Kim Il-sung expressed a similar view in his speech, \"On Eliminating Dogmatism and Formalism and Establishing Juche in Ideological Work\":{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=141}} <blockquote>What we are doing now is not a revolution in some foreign country but our Korean revolution. Therefore, every ideological action must benefit the Korean revolution. To fulfill the Korean revolution, one should be perfectly cognizant of the history of our national struggle, of Korea's geography, and our customs.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=141}}</blockquote>\nFrom then on, he and the WPK stressed the roles of \"revolutionary tradition\" and Korea's cultural tradition in its revolution.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=141}} At party meetings, members and cadres learned about North Korea's national prestige and its coming rejuvenation.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=141}} Traditional customs were revived, to showcase Korean-ness.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=141}} By 1965, Kim Il-sung claimed that if communists continued opposing [[Individualism|individuality]] and [[sovereign state|sovereignty]], the movement would be threatened by [[dogmatism]] and [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionism]].{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=142}} He criticized those communists who, he believed, subscribed to \"national [[nihilism]] by praising all things foreign and vilifying all things national\" and tried to impose foreign models on their own country.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=142}} By the 1960s, ''Juche'' was a full-fledged ideology calling for a distinct path for North Korean socialist construction and non-interference in its affairs; however, a decade later it was defined as a system whose \"fundamental principle was the realization of sovereignty\".{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=142}}\n\nAlthough WPK theoreticians were initially hostile towards the terms \"nation\" and \"nationalism\" because of the influence of the Stalinist definition of \"state\", by the 1970s their definition was changed from [[Marxism and the National Question|\"a stable, historically formed community of people based on common language, territory, economic life, and culture\"]] to include \"shared bloodline\".{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=142}} During the 1980s a common economic life was removed from the definition, with shared bloodline receiving increased emphasis.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=143}} With a democratic transition in South Korea and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the WPK revised the meaning of nationalism.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=143}} Previously defined in Stalinist terms as a bourgeois weapon to exploit the workers, nationalism changed from a [[reactionary]] to a [[progressivism|progressive]] idea.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=143}} Kim Il-sung differentiated \"nationalism\" from what he called \"genuine nationalism\"; while genuine nationalism was a progressive idea, nationalism remained reactionary:{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=143}}\n<blockquote>True nationalism (genuine nationalism) is similar to [[patriotism]]. Only a genuine patriot can become a devoted and true [[Proletarian internationalism|internationalist]]. In this sense, when I say communist, at the same time, I mean nationalist and internationalist.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=143}}</blockquote>\n\n====Allegations of xenophobia====\nDuring the 1960s the WPK began forcing ethnic Koreans to divorce their European spouses (who were primarily from the [[Eastern Bloc]]), with a high-ranking WPK official calling the marriages \"a crime against the Korean race\" and [[Eastern Bloc]] embassies in the country beginning to accuse the regime of [[fascism]].{{sfn|Becker|2005|p=66}} In May 1963, a Soviet diplomat described Kim Il-sung's political circle as a \"political [[Gestapo]]\".{{sfn|Becker|2005|p=66}} Similar remarks were made by other Eastern Bloc officials in North Korea, with the East German ambassador calling the policy \"Goebbelsian\" (a reference to [[Joseph Goebbels]], [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler's]] [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|minister of propaganda]]).{{sfn|Becker|2005|p=66}} Although this was said during a [[nadir]] in relations between North Korea and the Eastern Bloc, it illustrated a perception of racism in Kim Il-sung's policies.{{sfn|Becker|2005|p=66}}\n\nIn his book ''[[The Cleanest Race]]'' (2010), [[Brian Reynolds Myers]] dismisses the idea that ''Juche'' is North Korea's leading ideology.

A list of former Crown Prosecutors is as follows: \n\n# David Boy, [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] (1979\u20131982)\n# Max Lucas, QC (1982\u20131984)\n# Joseph Duffy, QC (1984\u20131986)\n# James Findlay, QC (1986\u20131989)\n# Anthony Duckett, QC (Acting, 1989\u20131990)\n# John Wood, [[Order of the Bath|CB]] (1990\u20131994)\n# [[Peter Nguyen (judge)|Peter Nguyen]], QC (1994\u20131997)\n\n== Structure ==\nThe DPP may be appointed from a wide range of candidates, as long as they have been called to the [[Hong Kong Bar]]; they can be either in private practice or serving in the government, and may be of any nationality. The longest serving DPP, [[Ian Grenville Cross|Ian Grenville Cross QC SC]], was a British career prosecutor, while the first Hong Kong Chinese DPP [[Keith Yeung|Keith Yeung SC]] was an eminent criminal Senior Counsel in private practice.  \n\nThe DPP is supported by four Deputy Directors of Public Prosecutions (DDPP) in charge of: <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.doj.gov.hk/eng/about/pd.html|title=Organisation chart of the Prosecutions Division|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n#'''Sub-division I (Advisory):''' Responsible for cases in the Court of First Instance, District Court, and Magistrates' Court \n#'''Sub-division II (Policy and Administration / Chief of Staff)''': Responsible for providing advice to other government departments and a wide range of administrative matters, including human resources, training, and [[media relations]]\n#'''Sub-division III (Advocacy and Appeals)''': Provides advocacy work on all levels, and are also responsible for advising and conducting appeals\n#'''Sub-division IV (Commercial Crime)''': Responsible for prosecuting all instances of [[commercial crime]]\n\nOne DDPP sub-division will also be designated as Chief of Staff; currently, this is with Sub-division II.\n\n== Independence of the DPP ==\nThe [[Secretary for Justice (Hong Kong)|Secretary for Justice]], a politically appointed role, is the chief prosecutor and ultimately can direct the DPP on criminal prosecution matters.

Traditionally, outgoing DPP's are offered the chance of a [[High Court (Hong Kong)|High Court]] judgeship; DPP's appointed to the High Court must go through a six-month \"cooling-off\" period, in which they are kept out of any criminal trials, civil cases, or appeals involving the government.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1309190/ex-prosecutor-kevin-zervos-appointed-high-court|title=Ex-prosecutor Kevin Zervos appointed to High Court|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> To date, Cross remains the only DPP not to become a High Court judge post-retirement, but whether this was due to his own personal choice or the fact that a position was not offered to him is unclear. \n\n== List of DPPs ==\nThe incumbent DPP is an unofficial Justice of the Peace, and is given the \"JP\" designation while in office;

First appointed in 1979, there have been seven different Crown Prosecutors between 1979 and 1997. A list of former Crown Prosecutors is as follows: \n\n# David Boy, [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] (1979\u20131982)\n# Max Lucas, QC (1982\u20131984)\n# Joseph Duffy, QC (1984\u20131986)\n# James Findlay, QC (1986\u20131989)\n# Anthony Duckett, QC (Acting, 1989\u20131990)\n# John Wood, [[Order of the Bath|CB]] (1990\u20131994)\n# [[Peter Nguyen (judge)|Peter Nguyen]], QC (1994\u20131997)\n\n== Structure ==\nThe DPP may be appointed from a wide range of candidates, as long as they have been called to the [[Hong Kong Bar]]; they can be either in private practice or serving in the government, and may be of any nationality. The longest serving DPP, [[Ian Grenville Cross|Ian Grenville Cross QC SC]], was a British career prosecutor, while the first Hong Kong Chinese DPP [[Keith Yeung|Keith Yeung SC]] was an eminent criminal Senior Counsel in private practice.  \n\nThe DPP is supported by four Deputy Directors of Public Prosecutions (DDPP) in charge of: <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.doj.gov.hk/eng/about/pd.html|title=Organisation chart of the Prosecutions Division|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n#'''Sub-division I (Advisory):''' Responsible for cases in the Court of First Instance, District Court, and Magistrates' Court \n#'''Sub-division II (Policy and Administration / Chief of Staff)''': Responsible for providing advice to other government departments and a wide range of administrative matters, including human resources, training, and media relations\n#'''Sub-division III (Advocacy and Appeals)''': Provides advocacy work on all levels, and are also responsible for advising and conducting appeals\n#'''Sub-division IV (Commercial Crime)''': Responsible for prosecuting all instances of commercial crime\n\nOne DDPP sub-division will also be designated as Chief of Staff; currently, this is with Sub-division II. \n\n== Independence of the DPP ==\nThe [[Secretary for Justice (Hong Kong)|Secretary for Justice]], a politically appointed role, is the chief prosecutor and ultimately can direct the DPP on criminal prosecution matters.

Traditionally, outgoing DPP's are offered the chance of a [[High Court (Hong Kong)|High Court]] judgeship; DPP's appointed to the High Court must go through a six-month \"cooling-off\" period, in which they are kept out of any criminal trials, civil cases, or appeals involving the government.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1309190/ex-prosecutor-kevin-zervos-appointed-high-court|title=Ex-prosecutor Kevin Zervos appointed to High Court|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> To date, Cross remains the only DPP not to become a High Court judge post-retirement, but whether this was due to his own personal choice or the fact that a position was not offered to him is unclear. \n\n== List of DPPs ==\nThe incumbent DPP is an unofficial Justice of the Peace, and is given the \"JP\" designation while in office;

The AI may learn useful general rules from the test-set, such as \"reviews containing the word 'horrible'\" are likely to be negative\". However, it may also learn inappropriate rules, such as \"reviews containing '[[Daniel Day-Lewis]]' are usually positive\"; such rules may be undesirable if they are deemed likely to fail to generalize outside the test set, or if people consider the rule to be \"cheating\" or \"unfair\". A human can audit rules in an XAI to get an idea how likely the system is to generalize to future real-world data outside the test-set.<ref name=science/>\n\n== Goals ==\nCooperation between [[Agency (sociology)|agents]], in this case algorithms and humans, depends on trust. If humans are to accept algorithmic prescriptions, they need to trust them. Incompleteness in formalization of trust criteria is a barrier to straightforward optimization approaches.

Research in [[intelligent tutoring systems]] developed systems such as SOPHIE that could act as an 'articulate expert', explaining problem-solving strategy at a level the student could understand, so they would know what action to take next. For instance, SOPHIE could explain the qualitative reasoning behind its electronics troubleshooting, even though it ultimately relied on the [[SPICE]] circuit simulator. Similarly, GUIDON added tutorial rules to supplement MYCIN's domain-level rules so it could explain strategy for medical diagnosis. Symbolic approaches to machine learning, especially those relying on explanation-based learning, such as PROTOS, explicitly relied on representations of explanations, both to explain their actions and to acquire new knowledge.\n\nIn the 1980s through early 1990s, truth maintenance systems (TMS) were developed to extend the capabilities of causal-reasoning, rule-based, and logic-based inference systems.<ref>{{Cite book| edition = Second| publisher = Prentice Hall, Pearson Education| isbn = 0-13-790395-2| last1 = Russell| first1 = Stuart| last2 = Norvig| first2 = Peter| title = Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach| location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey| series = Prentice Hall Series in Artificial Intelligence| date = 2003}}</ref>{{rp|360-362}} A TMS acts to explicitly track alternate lines of reasoning, justifications for conclusions, and lines of reasoning that lead to contradictions, allowing future reasoning to avoid these dead ends. To provide explanation, they trace reasoning from conclusions to assumptions through rule operations or logical inferences, allowing explanations to be generated from the reasoning traces.  As an example, consider a rule-based problem solver with just a few rules about Socrates that concludes he has died from poison:\n{{Quote\n|text=By just tracing through the dependency structure the problem solver can construct the following explanation: \"Socrates died because he was mortal and drank poison, and all mortals die when they drink poison.

Research in [[intelligent tutoring systems]] developed systems such as SOPHIE that could act as an 'articulate expert', explaining problem-solving strategy at a level the student could understand, so they would know what action to take next. For instance, SOPHIE could explain the qualitative reasoning behind its electronics troubleshooting, even though it ultimately relied on the [[SPICE]] circuit simulator. Similarly, GUIDON added tutorial rules to supplement MYCIN's domain-level rules so it could explain strategy for medical diagnosis. Symbolic approaches to machine learning, especially those relying on explanation-based learning, such as PROTOS, explicitly relied on representations of explanations, both to explain their actions and to acquire new knowledge.\n\nIn the 1980s through early 1990s, truth maintenance systems (TMS) were developed to extend the capabilities of causal-reasoning, rule-based, and logic-based inference systems.<ref>{{Cite book| edition = Second| publisher = Prentice Hall, Pearson Education| isbn = 0-13-790395-2| last1 = Russell| first1 = Stuart| last2 = Norvig| first2 = Peter| title = Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach| location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey| series = Prentice Hall Series in Artificial Intelligence| date = 2003}}</ref>{{rp|360-362}} A TMS acts to explicitly track alternate lines of reasoning, justifications for conclusions, and lines of reasoning that lead to contradictions, allowing future reasoning to avoid these dead ends. To provide explanation, they trace reasoning from conclusions to assumptions through rule operations or logical inferences, allowing explanations to be generated from the reasoning traces.  As an example, consider a rule-based problem solver with just a few rules about Socrates that concludes he has died from poison:\n{{Quote\n|text=By just tracing through the dependency structure the problem solver can construct the following explanation: \"Socrates died because he was mortal and drank poison, and all mortals die when they drink poison.
