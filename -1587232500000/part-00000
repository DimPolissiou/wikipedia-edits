He is the [[Archdeacon]] of [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]].\n\n==In the novel==\n[[Dom (title)|Dom]] Claude Frollo is a pious and highly knowledgeable man who was orphaned along with his younger brother Jehan when their parents died of [[black plague|the plague]]. His studies led him to become the Archdeacon of Josas, which is his position during the events of the novel. He also has a small [[fiefdom|fief]] which brings him a little money, most of which goes to fund his brother's [[alcoholism]].\n\nDuring a holiday at Notre Dame called [[Quasimodo Sunday]], he rescues a deformed [[hunchback]] child whom he finds abandoned on the cathedral's [[Child abandonment|foundlings]] bed. He adopts the boy, names him \"[[Quasimodo]]\" after the holiday, raises him like a son, and teaches him a sort of sign language when Quasimodo is deafened by the cathedral\u2019s bells. Frollo is a respected scholar and studies several languages, law, medicine, science and theology. However, he becomes infatuated with [[alchemy]], which leads townspeople to spread the rumor that he is a [[wikt:sorcerer|sorcerer]]. He also believes strongly in [[Fatalism|fate]]. All this, along with his extreme and [[Gynophobia|irrational fear of women]], contribute further to his isolation from society.\n\nFrollo also has strong passions, even though he is a [[Celibacy|celibate]] due to his station within the church. These passions erupt in him through his contact with the beautiful [[gypsy]] girl [[Esmeralda (The Hunchback of Notre-Dame)|Esm\u00e9ralda]], and eventually, they prove his undoing. He considers her to be a temptation sent by [[the Devil]] to test his faith, and curses her as a demon. He finds that he cannot resist her, however, and determines to give in to temptation. Esmeralda, however, is repulsed by his advances. Frollo orders Quasimodo to abduct her, and then abandons him when the hunchback is suddenly captured by [[Captain Phoebus|Captain Phoebus de Chateaupers]] and his guards. Frollo even ignores Quasimodo when he sees him being publicly humiliated for the crime. When Frollo discovers that Esmeralda is in love with Phoebus, he spies on the meeting between them which Esmeralda has arranged \u2013 with Phoebus' consent, as Phoebus only wants one night of passion.  As Phoebus and Esmeralda are about to make love, Frollo, in a jealous rage, stabs Phoebus, and kisses Esmeralda when she faints before fleeing.\n\nFrollo does not attempt to intercede when Esmeralda is turned over to the magistrate on charges of [[witchcraft]] and attempted murder, but he stabs himself during her torture and shows her the wound as a proof of his lust for her. She is unmoved, however, as she is still in love with Phoebus. Shortly before the day she is to be executed, Frollo leaves Paris in a feverish madness, not realizing that Quasimodo \u2013 who is in love with her \u2013 has rescued her from the gallows. When he returns to the news that Esmeralda is still alive, he becomes as jealous of Quasimodo as he was of Phoebus. Frollo later attempts to [[rape]] her at her sanctuary in the cathedral, but Quasimodo \u2013 who doesn't realize who Esmeralda's attacker is at first \u2013 comes to the girl's defense and beats him up. Angered and humiliated, Frollo decides to rid himself of Esmeralda by handing her over to the authorities.\n\nFrollo's time comes when a group of scoundrels, enraged by news that the French monarchy has ordered Esmeralda to be taken from the cathedral and hanged within three days, arms themselves to assault Notre Dame Cathedral. While Quasimodo is busy fighting off the scoundrels, [[Pierre Gringoire]], Esmeralda's husband \u2013 whom she only married to save his life \u2013 and a hooded figure sneak into the Cathedral and convince Esmeralda to sneak out with them. The man's face is hidden behind a hood, leaving Esmeralda to guess his identity. They flee to a boat on the [[River Seine]], then separate when they head to shore, with Gringoire taking her goat, Djali, and leaving Esmeralda with the unknown man. The hooded figure drags Esmeralda to a nearby gallows and identifies himself as Frollo by removing his hood.\n\nFrollo issues Esmeralda his final ultimatum: either she must submit to him, or he will hand her over to the authorities. She rejects him, so he leaves her to an [[anchorite|anchoress]] to hold her for the royal soldiers coming to hang her and goes back to Notre Dame Cathedral. He then walks up to one of the cathedral's towers to watch the girl being hanged, unaware that Quasimodo has spotted him and followed him upstairs. He watches calmly while Esmeralda is taken to the gallows.\n\nWhen Quasimodo sees him laughing at Esmeralda's hanging, he becomes enraged and pushes Frollo off the balustrade. A gargoyle stops his fall, and he cries out to Quasimodo for help, but Quasimodo remains silent. Then Frollo falls down off the cathedral, colliding with the roof of a house. He slides down the roof, hits the pavement of the town square and dies.<ref>{{cite book|first=Victor|last=Hugo|authorlink=Victor Hugo|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Hunchback_of_Notre_Dame.html?id=hZtfvHDFHE4C|title=The Hunchback of Notre-Dame|date=1831|edition=1993|publisher=[[Wordsworth Editions]]|location=Ware, Hertfordshire, England|isbn=978-1853260681|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\n==Adaptations==\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2017}}\n[[Victor Hugo]]'s [[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame|novel]] has been adapted to film on numerous occasions.

He despises Paris\u2019 Gypsy population and desires to wipe out their entire race. Like his original character in Victor Hugo's novel, Frollo lusts after Esmeralda to the point of obsession. Frollo believes everything he does is in accordance with God's will, despite frequent disagreements with the Archdeacon of Notre Dame.<ref name=\"disneyandsin.weebly\">{{cite web | url=http://disneyandsin.weebly.com/lust.html | title=Disney and the Seven Deadly Sins | accessdate=January 8, 2013}}</ref> While in the novel Frollo genuinely cares for Quasimodo, in this film he is Quasimodo's reluctant guardian and took him in only out of fear of God\u2019s punishment and the hope that the hunchback will someday be useful to him. Trousdale described the film's Frollo as \"a horrible, horrible person\", while Jay compared him to [[Hannibal Lecter]] in ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]''.<ref name=fictionmachine/>\n\nIn the beginning of the film, Frollo and his soldiers capture a group of [[Romani people|Gypsy]] peasants attempting to sneak illegally into Paris on a boat. A Gypsy woman in the group attempts to flee with her deformed baby, but Frollo kills her outside [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame Cathedral]]. He tries to kill the baby as well, but the cathedral's [[archdeacon]] intervenes and accuses Frollo of murdering an innocent woman. Fearing [[divine retribution]], Frollo reluctantly agrees to raise the deformed child in Notre Dame as his son, naming him \"Quasimodo\", and teaching him that the world outside the cathedral is a sinful place full of people who would hate him for his deformity.\n\nTwenty years later, in the [[Palais de Justice, Paris|Palace of Justice]], Frollo appoints a new [[Captain of the Guard]], Phoebus, stating his intent to eradicate the city's Gypsy population by discovering their sanctuary, the \"[[Cour des miracles|Court of Miracles]]\". While attending the annual [[Festival of Fools]], Frollo discovers a Gypsy dancer, Esmeralda, who attracts him with her beauty. He finds that Quasimodo has left the bell tower and joined the Festival. Quasimodo is humiliated by the crowd after two of Frollo's guards start a riot. Frollo refuses to help Quasimodo, going so far as to refuse Phoebus' request to stop it, and he is angered when Esmeralda defiantly decides to help Quasimodo. Esmeralda rebukes Frollo before claiming [[sanctuary]] inside the cathedral.\n\nFrollo soon develops lustful feelings for Esmeralda and begs the [[Virgin Mary]] to save him from her \"[[Spell (paranormal)|spell]]\"; he then resolves that \u201cshe will be mine, or she will burn\u201d. When Frollo learns that she has escaped Notre Dame, he instigates a citywide manhunt for her, even going as far as capturing and bribing Gypsies and [[Arson|burning]] countless houses in his way. Phoebus is appalled by Frollo's actions and openly defies him, and Frollo sentences him to death. While fleeing on Frollo's horse, Phoebus is struck by an arrow and falls into the [[River Seine]], but Esmeralda rescues him just in time and takes him to Notre Dame for refuge.\n\nFrollo returns to Notre Dame later that night and discovers that Quasimodo had helped Esmeralda escape. He lies to Quasimodo, saying that he knows about the Court of Miracles and that he intends to attack at dawn with 1,000 men. Following Quasimodo and Phoebus to the Court of Miracles, Frollo and his men capture all the Gypsies present. Frollo prepares to [[Death by burning|burn Esmeralda at the stake]], but offers to spare her life if she submits to his desires. A disgusted Esmeralda refuses, and Frollo prepares to execute her. Quasimodo rescues her, however, and brings her to the cathedral. Frollo orders his soldiers to attack and seize the cathedral. Phoebus releases the Gypsies and rallies the citizens of Paris against Frollo and his men. Quasimodo pours molten lead onto the streets to ensure that no one enters, but Frollo manages to get inside. Frollo attempts to kill Quasimodo, but Quasimodo overpowers him, and openly rejects everything that Frollo raised him to believe. Frollo pursues Quasimodo and Esmeralda to the balcony, where he taunts Quasimodo with the truth about his mother. Frollo knocks Quasimodo over the edge, but Quasimodo manages to hold on and ends up pulling Frollo along with him. Frollo climbs onto a gargoyle and raises his sword to strike at Esmeralda, but the gargoyle crumbles underneath him, causing him to lose his balance. In a vision, Frollo sees the gargoyle's face transform into that of [[Satan]]. Terrified, Frollo screams as the gargoyle breaks off entirely, sending him falling to his death into the molten lead below.\n\n===Later appearances===\n* Frollo appears in the [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] night-time show ''[[Fantasmic!]]'', called on by the [[Queen (Snow White)#Disney version|Evil Queen]] to fight [[Mickey Mouse]]. He is destroyed along with the other villains in the show's conclusion. Frollo made appearances at Disney's Hollywood Studios in the daily Disney Stars and Motor Cars Parade. In 2009, the parade moved to the [[Walt Disney Studios Park|Walt Disney Studios]] park at [[Disneyland Resort Paris]] and it is uncertain if Frollo will appear in this version, renamed Stars'n'Cars. Frollo makes a brief cameo appearance during the night-time show [[World of Color|Disney's ''World of Color'']] at [[Disney California Adventure Park]]. \"[[Hellfire (song)|Hellfire]]\", the song that Frollo sings in the feature film, is also heard in the show. Frollo also appears at the [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]] as a [[meetable character]].\n* Frollo makes a brief appearance at the beginning of the ''[[House of Mouse]]'' special ''[[Mickey's House of Villains|House of Villains]]''. He is seen sitting with the [[Mad Hatter]], who makes fun of his bulbous hat. He has no dialogue.\n* Frollo appears in ''[[Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance]]'', along with a world based on the Disney film called '''La Cit\u00e9 des Cloches'''. He plays out the same role as in the movie, though he is one of the few Disney villains who does not serve as a [[boss (video games)|boss]] battle. While the Sora scenario has Frollo die in the same manner as the movie, the Riku scenario had him fall to his death as a consequence of an updraft called by Wargoyle. He is voiced by Shouzou Sasaki in the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] version and by [[Corey Burton]] in the English version.\n* Frollo leads a team of Disney villains in ''The Kingdom Keepers IV: Power Play'' in order to free their leaders, [[Maleficent]] and [[Chernabog]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|France|Novels}}\n* [[Esmeralda (The Hunchback of Notre-Dame)|Esmeralda (''The Hunchback of Notre Dame'')]]\n* [[Quasimodo]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120815041619/http://www.claudefrollo.com/ Illustration Gallery]\n* Frollo in the [http://disney.go.com/vault/archives/villains/frollo/frollo.html Disney Archives-Villains].\n\n{{The Hunchback of Notre Dame}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Frollo, Claude}}\n[[Category:The Hunchback of Notre-Dame characters]]\n[[Category:Disney animated villains]]\n[[Category:Fictional alchemists]]\n[[Category:Fictional judges]]\n[[Category:Fictional mass murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional priests and priestesses]]\n[[Category:Fictional French people]]\n[[Category:Fictional French people in literature]]\n[[Category:Literary characters introduced in 1831]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional mayors|Claude Frollo#Disney Version|Claude Frollo]]\n[[Category:Fictional orphans]]\n[[Category:Male characters in literature]]\n[[Category:Male characters in film]]\n[[Category:Male literary villains]]\n[[Category:Male film villains]]\n", "text_old": "{{More footnotes|date=August 2009}}\n\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Claude Frollo\n| series             = [[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]]\n| image              = Luc-Olivier Merson - Frollo.jpg\n| caption            = Claude Frollo holding infant [[Quasimodo]] on the steps of Notre Dame in 1480.

He despises Paris\u2019 Gypsy population and desires to wipe out their entire race. Like his original character in Victor Hugo's novel, Frollo lusts after Esmeralda to the point of obsession. Frollo believes everything he does is in accordance with God's will, despite frequent disagreements with the Archdeacon of Notre Dame.<ref name=\"disneyandsin.weebly\">{{cite web | url=http://disneyandsin.weebly.com/lust.html | title=Disney and the Seven Deadly Sins | accessdate=January 8, 2013}}</ref> While in the novel Frollo genuinely cares for Quasimodo, in this film he is Quasimodo's reluctant guardian and took him in only out of fear of God\u2019s punishment and the hope that the hunchback will someday be useful to him. Trousdale described the film's Frollo as \"a horrible, horrible person\", while Jay compared him to [[Hannibal Lecter]] in ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]''.<ref name=fictionmachine/>\n\nIn the beginning of the film, Frollo and his soldiers capture a group of [[Romani people|Gypsy]] peasants attempting to sneak illegally into Paris on a boat. A Gypsy woman in the group attempts to flee with her deformed baby, but Frollo kills her outside [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame Cathedral]]. He tries to kill the baby as well, but the cathedral's [[archdeacon]] intervenes and accuses Frollo of murdering an innocent woman. Fearing [[divine retribution]], Frollo reluctantly agrees to raise the deformed child in Notre Dame as his son, naming him \"Quasimodo\", and teaching him that the world outside the cathedral is a sinful place full of people who would hate him for his deformity.\n\nTwenty years later, in the [[Palais de Justice, Paris|Palace of Justice]], Frollo appoints a new [[Captain of the Guard]], Phoebus, stating his intent to eradicate the city's Gypsy population by discovering their sanctuary, the \"[[Cour des miracles|Court of Miracles]]\". While attending the annual [[Festival of Fools]], Frollo discovers a Gypsy dancer, Esmeralda, who attracts him with her beauty. He finds that Quasimodo has left the bell tower and joined the Festival. Quasimodo is humiliated by the crowd after two of Frollo's guards start a riot. Frollo refuses to help Quasimodo, going so far as to refuse Phoebus' request to stop it, and he is angered when Esmeralda defiantly decides to help Quasimodo. Esmeralda rebukes Frollo before claiming [[sanctuary]] inside the cathedral.\n\nFrollo soon develops lustful feelings for Esmeralda and begs the [[Virgin Mary]] to save him from her \"[[Spell (paranormal)|spell]]\"; he then resolves that \u201cshe will be mine, or she will burn\u201d. When Frollo learns that she has escaped Notre Dame, he instigates a citywide manhunt for her, even going as far as capturing and bribing Gypsies and [[Arson|burning]] countless houses in his way. Phoebus is appalled by Frollo's actions and openly defies him, and Frollo sentences him to death. While fleeing on Frollo's horse, Phoebus is struck by an arrow and falls into the [[River Seine]], but Esmeralda rescues him just in time and takes him to Notre Dame for refuge.\n\nFrollo returns to Notre Dame later that night and discovers that Quasimodo had helped Esmeralda escape. He lies to Quasimodo, saying that he knows about the Court of Miracles and that he intends to attack at dawn with 1,000 men. Following Quasimodo and Phoebus to the Court of Miracles, Frollo and his men capture all the Gypsies present. Frollo prepares to [[Death by burning|burn Esmeralda at the stake]], but offers to spare her life if she submits to his desires. A disgusted Esmeralda refuses, and Frollo prepares to execute her. Quasimodo rescues her, however, and brings her to the cathedral. Frollo orders his soldiers to attack and seize the cathedral. Phoebus releases the Gypsies and rallies the citizens of Paris against Frollo and his men. Quasimodo pours molten lead onto the streets to ensure that no one enters, but Frollo manages to get inside. Frollo attempts to kill Quasimodo, but Quasimodo overpowers him, and openly rejects everything that Frollo raised him to believe. Frollo pursues Quasimodo and Esmeralda to the balcony, where he taunts Quasimodo with the truth about his mother. Frollo knocks Quasimodo over the edge, but Quasimodo manages to hold on and ends up pulling Frollo along with him. Frollo climbs onto a gargoyle and raises his sword to strike at Esmeralda, but the gargoyle crumbles underneath him, causing him to lose his balance. In a vision, Frollo sees the gargoyle's face transform into that of [[Satan]]. Terrified, Frollo screams as the gargoyle breaks off entirely, sending him falling to his death into the molten lead below.\n\n===Later appearances===\n* Frollo appears in the [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] night-time show ''[[Fantasmic!]]'', called on by the [[Queen (Snow White)#Disney version|Evil Queen]] to fight [[Mickey Mouse]]. He is destroyed along with the other villains in the show's conclusion. Frollo made appearances at Disney's Hollywood Studios in the daily Disney Stars and Motor Cars Parade. In 2009, the parade moved to the [[Walt Disney Studios Park|Walt Disney Studios]] park at [[Disneyland Resort Paris]] and it is uncertain if Frollo will appear in this version, renamed Stars'n'Cars. Frollo makes a brief cameo appearance during the night-time show [[World of Color|Disney's ''World of Color'']] at [[Disney California Adventure Park]]. \"[[Hellfire (song)|Hellfire]]\", the song that Frollo sings in the feature film, is also heard in the show. Frollo also appears at the [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]] as a [[meetable character]].\n* Frollo makes a brief appearance at the beginning of the ''[[House of Mouse]]'' special ''[[Mickey's House of Villains|House of Villains]]''. He is seen sitting with the [[Mad Hatter]], who makes fun of his bulbous hat. He has no dialogue.\n* Frollo appears in ''[[Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance]]'', along with a world based on the Disney film called '''La Cit\u00e9 des Cloches'''. He plays out the same role as in the movie, though he is one of the few Disney villains who does not serve as a [[boss (video games)|boss]] battle. While the Sora scenario has Frollo die in the same manner as the movie, the Riku scenario had him fall to his death as a consequence of an updraft called by Wargoyle. He is voiced by Shouzou Sasaki in the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] version and by [[Corey Burton]] in the English version.\n* Frollo leads a team of Disney villains in ''The Kingdom Keepers IV: Power Play'' in order to free their leaders, [[Maleficent]] and [[Chernabog]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|France|Novels}}\n* [[Esmeralda (The Hunchback of Notre-Dame)|Esmeralda (''The Hunchback of Notre Dame'')]]\n* [[Quasimodo]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120815041619/http://www.claudefrollo.com/ Illustration Gallery]\n* Frollo in the [http://disney.go.com/vault/archives/villains/frollo/frollo.html Disney Archives-Villains].\n\n{{The Hunchback of Notre Dame}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Frollo, Claude}}\n[[Category:The Hunchback of Notre-Dame characters]]\n[[Category:Disney animated villains]]\n[[Category:Fictional alchemists]]\n[[Category:Fictional judges]]\n[[Category:Fictional mass murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional priests and priestesses]]\n[[Category:Fictional French people]]\n[[Category:Fictional French people in literature]]\n[[Category:Literary characters introduced in 1831]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional mayors|Claude Frollo#Disney Version|Claude Frollo]]\n[[Category:Fictional orphans]]\n[[Category:Male characters in literature]]\n[[Category:Male characters in film]]\n[[Category:Male literary villains]]\n[[Category:Male film villains]]\n", "name_user": "WikiLover4Ever", "label": "safe", "comment": "Eliminated italics quotation marks on a non-title description.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Frollo"}

These complex architectures allow some group I and group II introns to be ''self-splicing'', that is, the intron-containing RNA molecule can rearrange its own covalent structure so as to precisely remove the intron and link the exons together in the correct order. In some cases, particular intron-binding proteins are involved in splicing, acting in such a way that they assist the intron in folding into the three-dimensional structure that is necessary for self-splicing activity.

At least seven mechanisms of intron gain have been reported thus far: Intron Transposition, Transposon Insertion, Tandem Genomic Duplication, Intron Transfer, Intron Gain during Double-Strand Break Repair (DSBR), Insertion of a Group II Intron, and Intronization.  In theory it should be easiest to deduce the origin of recently gained introns due to the lack of host-induced mutations, yet even introns gained recently did not arise from any of the aforementioned mechanisms. These findings thus raise the question of whether or not the proposed mechanisms of intron gain fail to describe the mechanistic origin of many novel introns because they are not accurate mechanisms of intron gain, or if there are other, yet to be discovered, processes generating novel introns.<ref name=\"Yenerall2012\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Yenerall | first1 = P. | last2 = Zhou | first2 = L. | doi = 10.1186/1745-6150-7-29 | title = Identifying the mechanisms of intron gain: Progress and trends | journal = Biology Direct | volume = 7 | pages = 29 | year = 2012 | pmid =  22963364| pmc =3443670 }}</ref>\n\nIn intron transposition, the most commonly purported intron gain mechanism, a spliced intron is thought to reverse splice into either its own mRNA or another mRNA at a previously intron-less position. This intron-containing mRNA is then reverse transcribed and the resulting intron-containing cDNA may then cause intron gain via complete or partial recombination with its original genomic locus. Transposon insertions can also result in intron creation. Such an insertion could intronize the transposon without disrupting the coding sequence when a transposon inserts into the sequence AGGT, resulting in the duplication of this sequence on each side of the transposon. It is not yet understood why these elements are spliced, whether by chance, or by some preferential action by the transposon. In tandem genomic duplication, due to the similarity between consensus donor and acceptor splice sites, which both closely resemble AGGT, the tandem genomic duplication of an exonic segment harboring an AGGT sequence generates two potential splice sites. When recognized by the spliceosome, the sequence between the original and duplicated AGGT will be spliced, resulting in the creation of an intron without alteration of the coding sequence of the gene. Double-stranded break repair via non-homologous end joining was recently identified as a source of intron gain when researchers identified short direct repeats flanking 43% of gained introns in Daphnia.<ref name=\"Yenerall2012\"/> These numbers must be compared to the number of conserved introns flanked by repeats in other organisms, though, for statistical relevance. For group II intron insertion, the retrohoming of a group II intron into a nuclear gene was proposed to cause recent spliceosomal intron gain.\n\nIntron transfer has been hypothesized to result in intron gain when a paralog or pseudogene gains an intron and then transfers this intron via recombination to an intron-absent location in its sister paralog. Intronization is the process by which mutations create novel introns from formerly exonic sequence. Thus, unlike other proposed mechanisms of intron gain, this mechanism does not require the insertion or generation of DNA to create a novel intron.<ref name=\"Yenerall2012\"/>\n\nThe only hypothesized mechanism of recent intron gain lacking any direct evidence is that of group II intron insertion, which when demonstrated in vivo, abolishes gene expression.<ref>{{Cite journal \n| last1 = Chalamcharla | first1 = V.

These complex architectures allow some group I and group II introns to be ''self-splicing'', that is, the intron-containing RNA molecule can rearrange its own covalent structure so as to precisely remove the intron and link the exons together in the correct order. In some cases, particular intron-binding proteins are involved in splicing, acting in such a way that they assist the intron in folding into the three-dimensional structure that is necessary for self-splicing activity. Group I and group II introns are distinguished by different sets of internal conserved sequences and folded structures, and by the fact that splicing of RNA molecules containing group II introns generates branched introns (like those of spliceosomal RNAs), while group I introns use a non-encoded guanosine nucleotide (typically GTP) to initiate splicing, adding it on to the 5'-end of the excised intron.\n\n== Biological functions and evolution ==\nWhile introns do not encode protein products, they are integral to gene expression regulation.

In theory it should be easiest to deduce the origin of recently gained introns due to the lack of host-induced mutations, yet even introns gained recently did not arise from any of the aforementioned mechanisms. These findings thus raise the question of whether or not the proposed mechanisms of intron gain fail to describe the mechanistic origin of many novel introns because they are not accurate mechanisms of intron gain, or if there are other, yet to be discovered, processes generating novel introns.<ref name=\"Yenerall2012\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Yenerall | first1 = P. | last2 = Zhou | first2 = L. | doi = 10.1186/1745-6150-7-29 | title = Identifying the mechanisms of intron gain: Progress and trends | journal = Biology Direct | volume = 7 | pages = 29 | year = 2012 | pmid =  22963364| pmc =3443670 }}</ref>\n\nIn intron transposition, the most commonly purported intron gain mechanism, a spliced intron is thought to reverse splice into either its own mRNA or another mRNA at a previously intron-less position. This intron-containing mRNA is then reverse transcribed and the resulting intron-containing cDNA may then cause intron gain via complete or partial recombination with its original genomic locus. Transposon insertions can also result in intron creation. Such an insertion could intronize the transposon without disrupting the coding sequence when a transposon inserts into the sequence AGGT, resulting in the duplication of this sequence on each side of the transposon. It is not yet understood why these elements are spliced, whether by chance, or by some preferential action by the transposon. In tandem genomic duplication, due to the similarity between consensus donor and acceptor splice sites, which both closely resemble AGGT, the tandem genomic duplication of an exonic segment harboring an AGGT sequence generates two potential splice sites. When recognized by the spliceosome, the sequence between the original and duplicated AGGT will be spliced, resulting in the creation of an intron without alteration of the coding sequence of the gene. Double-stranded break repair via non-homologous end joining was recently identified as a source of intron gain when researchers identified short direct repeats flanking 43% of gained introns in Daphnia.<ref name=\"Yenerall2012\"/> These numbers must be compared to the number of conserved introns flanked by repeats in other organisms, though, for statistical relevance. For group II intron insertion, the retrohoming of a group II intron into a nuclear gene was proposed to cause recent spliceosomal intron gain.\n\nIntron transfer has been hypothesized to result in intron gain when a paralog or pseudogene gains an intron and then transfers this intron via recombination to an intron-absent location in its sister paralog. Intronization is the process by which mutations create novel introns from formerly exonic sequence. Thus, unlike other proposed mechanisms of intron gain, this mechanism does not require the insertion or generation of DNA to create a novel intron.<ref name=\"Yenerall2012\"/>\n\nThe only hypothesized mechanism of recent intron gain lacking any direct evidence is that of group II intron insertion, which when demonstrated in vivo, abolishes gene expression.<ref>{{Cite journal \n| last1 = Chalamcharla | first1 = V.

He has written newspaper articles and autobiographical, historical and fictional books. \n\nLowell Green was born in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], United States, to Canadian parents, and [[Immigration|immigrated]] to Canada.  He graduated from [[Macdonald Campus|Macdonald Agricultural College]] of [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal]] [[Quebec]] in 1956. \n\n== Career ==\nLowell Green started his radio broadcasting career in [[Brantford]], Ontario, and subsequently moved to radio stations in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] Ontario and Montreal Quebec.  Green arrived in Ottawa at CFRA in 1960 as a news and [[farm]] reporter.  In 1966, he began hosting ''Greenline'', and eventually became the longest-running open-line talk show host in [[North America]]. He retired briefly from radio in the 1980s, but returned in 1990.

Although the CBSC determined that Green's conduct had contravened its guidelines on discrimination, it also decided that the station had responded appropriately, and the group did not prescribe any further action. In 2006 and 2008, the council censured Green for his treatment of a Muslim man who challenged Green on the way the radio show host portrays Islam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|archivedate=21 November 2010|accessdate=2010-11-30|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|archivedate=8 October 2011|accessdate=2009-08-07|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  In June 2017, there was controversy as to whether [[Indigo Books and Music]] had pulled Green's latest book, ''Amazing But True!'', from its bookshelves in stores in Canada.<ref>{{cite news|last=Johnston|first=Geoffrey|url=http://www.thewhig.com/2017/06/01/author-battles-censorship|title=Author battles 'censorship'|date=1 June 2017|newspaper=The Kingston Whig-Standard|accessdate=12 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.facebook.com/lgreen.ca/ Lowell Green at Facebook]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090212100107/http://cbsc.ca/english/decisions/1994/940604.php 1994 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php 2006 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php 2009 decision]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Green, Lowell}}\n[[Category:1936 births]]\n[[Category:Canadian non-fiction writers]]\n[[Category:Canadian people of Irish descent]]\n[[Category:Canadian talk radio hosts]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:McGill University alumni]]\n[[Category:Ontario Liberal Party candidates in Ontario provincial elections]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ann Arbor, Michigan]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ottawa]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use Canadian English|date=February 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n{{Infobox presenter\n|name        = Lowell Green\n|alias       = \n|image       = \n|image_size  = \n|caption     = \n|birth_name  = \n|birth_date  = {{Birth date and age|df=yes|1936|07|07}}\n|birth_place = [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], United States\n|death_date  = \n|death_place = \n|show        = ''The Lowell Green Show'' (also known as ''The Island of Sanity'')\n|station     = [[CFRA (AM)|CFRA]] Ottawa\n|timeslot    = Weekdays 10 am to 12pm\n|show2       = \n|station2    = \n|timeslot2   = \n|style       = [[Talk radio]]\n|country     = {{CAN}}\n|prevshow    =Greenline \n|website     = \n|spouse=Deborah Green|awards=}}\n\n'''Lowell Green''' (born 7 July 1936) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[radio personality]], [[journalist]], and [[author]], best known as the host of ''The Lowell Green Show'', a conservative morning [[talk show]] that aired on the [[Ottawa]] [[Ontario]] radio station [[CFRA]].

He played a major role in the development of the [[activated sludge process]] for biological [[wastewater treatment]] in sewage treatment plants and the establishment of an infrastructure for treatment and disposal of municipal and industrial wastewater. Further fields of his broad spectrum of activities included the training of operating personnel of wastewater treatment plants. He initiated the establishment of corresponding training networks and participated in their organisation in a leading position. His work provided the central basis for concepts of water protection and for maintaining and improving water quality.\n\n== Life ==\nWilhelm von der Emde was born in [[Kassel]], Germany. Interrupted by military service, he studied civil engineering at the [[Technical University of Hanover]] (Technische Hochschule Hannover) from 1940 to 1948. From 1949 to the end of 1952 he worked in Dietrich Kehr's engineering office, from 1953 to 1958 he was assistant and senior engineer at the Institute for Urban Water Management at the Technical University of Hannover (Director: Dietrich Kehr)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oewav.at/Page.aspx?target=391572|title=\u00d6WAV News, 03.03.2020|last=|first=|date=|website=oewav.at|language=de|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=7 April 2020}}</ref>, where he received his doctorate on 10 July 1957.\n\nIn his dissertation<ref>Wilhelm v.d. Emde: ''Beitrag zu Versuchen zur Abwasserreinigung mit belebtem Schlamm'', published by the Institute for Urban Water Management of the Technical University of Hanover, Hannover, 1957</ref>, he described the state of the art of the methodology for dimensioning wastewater treatment plants at that time and developed a new procedure to calculate the oxygen consumption and excess sludge production of aeration plants, which is still used today in a slightly modified form. In the following years (1958-1964) he worked as head of the department of wastewater treatment plants at Stadtentw\u00e4sserung Hamburg. Overlapping (from 1960 to 1964) he was a lecturer at the Technical University of Braunschweig and from April 1961 onward he also lectured at the Technical University of Delft. During a stay in England (Manchester) he met William T. Lockett, one of the inventors of the activated sludge process. In 1914 Lockett, together with Edward Ardern, had invented the activated sludge process based on the work of [[Gilbert John Fowler]].<ref>Edward Ardern, William T Lockett: ''Experiments of the oxidation of sewage without the aid of filters'', Journal of the Society of Chemical Industries, (1914) 33, 523\u2013539</ref>\n\nIn 1960, at the suggestion of the World Health Organisation ([[WHO]]) and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ([[OECD]]), with the participation of the Technical University of Delft and the Netherlands Universities Foundation for International Cooperation ([[Nuffic]]), the \"European Course in Sanitary Engineering\", today IHE Delft ([[UNESCO-IHE]]) was established. Wilhelm von der Emde was a full-time lecturer at this research and educational institution from 1962 until 1964 when he accepted a position at the [[TU Wien]]. There he founded the Institute for Water Supply, Wastewater Treatment and Water Pollution Control (today: Institute for Water Quality and Resource Management), which he headed from 1 October 1964 until his retirement on 1 October 1987.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://iwr.tuwien.ac.at/wasser/kontakt/institutsbeschreibung/|title=Institutsbeschreibung iwr, TU Wien|last=|first=|date=|website=tuwien.at|language=de|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=7 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nWilhelm von der Emde died on 19 February 2020 at the age of 98 in [[Baden (Nieder\u00f6sterreich)|Baden]] / Vienna.<ref>Bezirksblatt Baden, 04/05 March 2020, p. 49</ref>\n\n== Work and achivements ==\nDuring his work at Hamburg's municipal wastewater treatment company ([[Hamburger Stadtentw\u00e4sserung]]), he was significantly involved in the planning of the [[Kl\u00e4ranlage K\u00f6hlbrandh\u00f6ft|K\u00f6hlbrandh\u00f6ft]] wastewater treatment plant, the first large-scale plant with high-load biology.<ref>Wilhelm Hosang, Wolfgang Bischof, Abwassertechnik. 1998, II. neubearbeitete Auflage, Springer, S. 483</ref>\n\nIn the late 1960s, Wilhelm von der Emde, together with [[Rolf Kayser (Wasserbauingenieur)|Rolf Kayser]] (later holder of the chair for urban water management at [[TU Braunschweig]]), planned the Blumental wastewater treatment plant in Vienna, which went into operation in 1969.<ref>Wilhelm v.d.

Wasserwirtschaft 38 (1986), 198\u2013207</ref>\n\nVon der Emde recognised very early on, that the objectives of water protection can only be achieved if pollution by industrial wastewater is largely avoided. Under his leadership, the institute, therefore, dealt intensively with the treatment and disposal of wastewater from leather, pulp<ref>Hellmut Fleckseder: ''Beitrag zur Reinigung der Abw\u00e4sser aus der Sulfitzellstofferzeugung'', Dissertation 1973, TU Wien</ref> and sugar production<ref>Helmut Kroiss: ''Ein Beitrag zur Reinigung von Zuckerfabriksabwasser'', Dissertation 1978, TU Wien</ref> as well as the chemical industry, which were responsible for a substantial part of the pollution of water bodies in Austria. In many cases, new wastewater treatment processes were developed from laboratory tests to the operation of large-scale plants. A typical example is a process developed in the 1980s for the purification of wastewater from citric acid production by the company [[Jungbunzlauer]] in Pernhofen (Lower Austria).<ref>Helmut Kroiss: ''Anaerobe Abwasserreinigung'', Wiener Mitteilungen, Band 62, Wien, 1988</ref> The central part of the solution to this problem is the anaerobic pre-treatment of the concentrated wastewater, which takes place in an upflow sludge bed reactor with a rotary distributor (EKJ reactor). As a joint project together with his successor at TU Wien, [[Helmut Kroiss]], this device was patented in 1983).<ref>Patent DE 3324072 C2: ''Apparatus for anaerobic waste water treatment.'' 1983 [https://patents.google.com/patent/DE3324072C2/en?oq=ininventor:Dr-Ing+Wilhelm+Von+Der+Emde(google.at)]</ref>\n\nIn the field of river basin management, Wilhelm von der Emde researched the relationship between wastewater treatment and water quality. In practice, the results led to improved water protection and a considerable increase in water quality, not only in Austria. For example, acted the \"Danube Expert Report\", the content of which led to the \"Danube Regulation\", as a tool to legally anchor biological wastewater treatment in Austria.<ref>Wilhelm v. d.

He played a major role in the development of the [[activated sludge process]] for biological [[wastewater treatment]] in sewage treatment plants and the establishment of an infrastructure for treatment and disposal of municipal and industrial wastewater. Further fields of his broad spectrum of activities included the training of operating personnel of wastewater treatment plants. He initiated the establishment of corresponding training networks and participated in their organisation in a leading position. His work provided the central basis for concepts of water protection and for maintaining and improving water quality.\n\n== Life ==\nWilhelm von der Emde was born in [[Kassel]] / Germany. Interrupted by military service, he studied civil engineering at the [[Technical University of Hanover]] (Technische Hochschule Hannover) from 1940 to 1948. From 1949 to the end of 1952 he worked in Dietrich Kehr's engineering office, from 1953 to 1958 he was assistant and senior engineer at the Institute for Urban Water Management at the Technical University of Hannover (Director: Dietrich Kehr)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oewav.at/Page.aspx?target=391572|title=\u00d6WAV News, 03.03.2020|last=|first=|date=|website=oewav.at|language=de|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=7 April 2020}}</ref>, where he received his doctorate on 10 July 1957.\n\nIn his dissertation<ref>Wilhelm v.d. Emde: ''Beitrag zu Versuchen zur Abwasserreinigung mit belebtem Schlamm'', published by the Institute for Urban Water Management of the Technical University of Hanover, Hannover, 1957</ref>, he described the state of the art of the methodology for dimensioning wastewater treatment plants at that time and developed a new procedure to calculate the oxygen consumption and excess sludge production of aeration plants, which is still used today in a slightly modified form. In the following years (1958-1964) he worked as head of the department of wastewater treatment plants at Stadtentw\u00e4sserung Hamburg. Overlapping (from 1960 to 1964) he was a lecturer at the Technical University of Braunschweig and from April 1961 onward he also lectured at the Technical University of Delft. During a stay in England (Manchester) he met William T. Lockett, one of the inventors of the activated sludge process. In 1914 Lockett, together with Edward Ardern, had invented the activated sludge process based on the work of [[Gilbert John Fowler]].<ref>Edward Ardern, William T Lockett: ''Experiments of the oxidation of sewage without the aid of filters'', Journal of the Society of Chemical Industries, (1914) 33, 523\u2013539</ref>\n\nIn 1960, at the suggestion of the World Health Organisation ([[WHO]]) and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ([[OECD]]), with the participation of the Technical University of Delft and the Netherlands Universities Foundation for International Cooperation ([[Nuffic]]), the \"European Course in Sanitary Engineering\", today IHE Delft ([[UNESCO-IHE]]) was established. Wilhelm von der Emde was a full-time lecturer at this research and educational institution from 1962 until 1964 when he accepted a position at the [[TU Wien]]. There he founded the Institute for Water Supply, Wastewater Treatment and Water Pollution Control (today: Institute for Water Quality and Resource Management), which he headed from 1 October 1964 until his retirement on 1 October 1987.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://iwr.tuwien.ac.at/wasser/kontakt/institutsbeschreibung/|title=Institutsbeschreibung iwr, TU Wien|last=|first=|date=|website=tuwien.at|language=de|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=7 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nWilhelm von der Emde died on 19 February 2020 at the age of 98 in [[Baden (Nieder\u00f6sterreich)|Baden]] / Vienna.<ref>Bezirksblatt Baden, 04/05 March 2020, p. 49</ref>\n\n== Work and achivements ==\nDuring his work at Hamburg's municipal wastewater treatment company ([[Hamburger Stadtentw\u00e4sserung]]), he was significantly involved in the planning of the [[Kl\u00e4ranlage K\u00f6hlbrandh\u00f6ft|K\u00f6hlbrandh\u00f6ft]] wastewater treatment plant, the first large-scale plant with high-load biology.<ref>Wilhelm Hosang, Wolfgang Bischof, Abwassertechnik. 1998, II. neubearbeitete Auflage, Springer, S. 483</ref>\n\nIn the late 1960s, Wilhelm von der Emde, together with [[Rolf Kayser (Wasserbauingenieur)|Rolf Kayser]] (later holder of the chair for urban water management at [[TU Braunschweig]]), planned the Blumental wastewater treatment plant in Vienna, which went into operation in 1969.<ref>Wilhelm v.d.

The area was laid out mainly in the 18th century, largely by landowners such as [[Wriothesley Russell, 3rd Duke of Bedford]], who built Bloomsbury Market, which opened in 1730. The major development of the squares that we see today started in about 1800 when [[Francis Russell, 5th Duke of Bedford]] removed Bedford House and developed the land to the north with [[Russell Square]] as its centrepiece.\n\nIn 1547 the area became part of a new, late formed [[Civil Parish#Ancient Parishes|Ancient Parish]] of [[St Giles, London|St Giles]], with the church of [[St Giles in the Fields]] elevated to the status of parish church. In 1731 a small new independent parish of Bloomsbury was created, based on the area round [[Bloomsbury Square]].

The area was laid out mainly in the 18th century, largely by landowners such as [[Wriothesley Russell, 3rd Duke of Bedford]], who built Bloomsbury Market, which opened in 1730. The major development of the squares that we see today started in about 1800 when [[Francis Russell, 5th Duke of Bedford]] removed Bedford House and developed the land to the north with [[Russell Square]] as its centrepiece.\n\nIn 1547 the area became part of a new, late formed [[Civil Parish#Ancient Parishes|Ancient Parish]] of [[St Giles, London|St Giles]], with the church of [[St Giles in the Fields]] elevated to the status of parish church. In 1731 a small new independent parish of Bloomsbury was created, based on the area round [[Bloomsbury Square]].
