It is about a  girl named Willa ([[Jordan Todosey]]) who has a giraffe, a camel, two elephants, an alligator, and many more zoo animals. The series originally aired on [[Qubo]] in the United States (which has been put back on Qubo's schedule as of 2019), [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]] in Canada and [[France 3]] in France. The series is Flash-animated with Toon Boom Harmony.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===People===\n* '''Willa''' is the main character of the series, who has many exotic animals much to her father's discomfort. She also has lots of wacky adventures and learns lessons along the way. Because of her adventures, she often gets into trouble. Willa is kindhearted and caring and never tries to hurt her friends' feelings. She is usually seen with a green shirt, a red jumper and a green headband. She appears in every episode and is voiced by [[Jordan Todosey]].\n* '''Dooley''' is Willa's next-door neighbor and best friend. Dooley often gets caught up in Willa's adventures. He helps Willa learn lessons during their adventures. Dooley is usually seen wearing a purple T-shirt, yellow pants and thick, round glasses. He is voiced by [[Samantha Reynolds]].\n* '''Dad''' is Willa's single father. Dad is uncomfortable with the animals around the house, but knowing how Willa cares for them and how helpful they can be, he lets her keep them. He helps Willa learn lessons along the way. He is usually seen with an orange vest, long-sleeved blue shirt, brown pants, and glasses. He loves and cares for Willa. He apparently has a crush on Ms. Vanderwinkle. His real name is never revealed. And there's no enough evidence to know who's Willa's mother. It's either Willa's parents are divorced or her mother died.\n* '''Sara, Kara, and Lara''' are friends (for over a year<ref>{{cite episode |title=Party Animals |series=Willa's Wild Life |author=Sara |quote=I still can't believe it's been a whole year since we met}}</ref>) who look, dress, and act the same and think they are cooler than everyone.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Party Animals |series=Willa's Wild Life |author=Kara |quote=And discovered how much cooler we are than everybody else!}}</ref> They often bully Willa, Dooley and Evelyn, and use the wrong names, calling Willa \"Wanda/Wendy/Willetta/Wilma/Winifred/Winona\" and Dooley \"Danny/Dickie/Donnie\". They are members of the dance club, practice ballet<ref>{{cite episode |title=Willa Willa Everywhere |series=Willa's Wild Life}}</ref> and all own dogs.\n**'''Sara''' has a pale skin tone and long blonde hair, red lipstick and pink clothes. She has a red poodle named Susu.\n**'''Kara''' has a light skin tone and long red hair, purple lipstick and purple clothes. She has a purple poodle named Kuku.\n**'''Lara''' is African-American and has long brown hair, green lipstick and green clothes. She has a green poodle named Lulu.\n* '''Evelyn''' is Willa's friend. Evelyn frequently gets into Willa's adventures. She seems to be grumpy all the time and gets discouraged easily. With Willa and Dooley's help, she learns to have fun and be happy. Evelyn is tall, has red hair and is usually seen wearing a long-sleeved turquoise shirt, and capri blue jeans.\n* '''Mr. Tremble''' is the assistant principal at Willa's class. Mr. Tremble easily gets into Willa's adventures. He is usually seen wearing an orange toupee, a brown jacket and blue pants. When he is in Willa's adventures, he often loses his toupee.\n* '''Ms. Delilah Vanderwinkle''' is Willa's other next-door neighbor. Ms. Vanderwinkle is usually seen with a long-sleeved pink shirt, a flowered dress, and cat-eye glasses. She has an orange cat named Tangerine, and a nephew named Buzzy whom Willa babysits in \"Baby It's You.\" Ms. Vanderwinkle's first name was revealed in \"Willa & Dooley Sitting in a Tree.\"\n* '''The Mailman''' appears in some episodes and is mostly scared by Gus.\n* '''Tiffy Tootle''' is a famous blonde-haired girl with decorative pigtails. Tiffy makes her only appearance in ''Willa's Wonderful Life'' and near the end of this episode, she sees her biggest fan Willa and her family makes pizzas.\n\n===Animals===\n* '''Gus''' is an [[alligator]]. He is rude and obnoxious. Whenever he has a chance, he tries to eat the Bunnies, but is always caught by either Willa or one of the other animals. He sleeps under Willa's bed. Gus is always hungry, being an alligator. He is voiced by [[Danny Wells]].\n* '''Jenny''' is a [[giraffe]]. Jenny is the wisest of the animals. She helps Willa during her adventures and acts as a mother figure to Willa since Willa's mother is not around. Due to her size, Jenny sleeps outside.\n* '''Inky, Blinky, and Bob''' are [[penguin]]s. Inky, Blinky, and Bob are the least intelligent of all the animals. Bob cannot speak, he just makes gestures accompanied by trombone sounds. They call Willa \"Gladys.\" They are very good at ice skating. They sleep in the freezer. They also have a love for herrings, like hoe real-life penguins eat herrings for survival. In every episode they are always involved with something. They are voiced by Dwayne Hill and Jay T. Schramek.\n* '''KoKo''' is a [[kangaroo]] from Australia. She has a pink bow on her head and keeps many things in her pouch. For instance, she keeps makeup products, scissors and a signed photograph of a famous kangaroo named Willard Wallaby. She sleeps in the living room. KoKo is the girliest of the animals. She is voiced by Katie Bergin.\n* '''Steve and Edie''' are two [[Pinniped|seals]] that used to be in show business before living with Willa. Steve's skin is darker than Edie's. Edie has a flower hair clip on her head. They give a performance every week in Willa's backyard and are talented musicians. They sleep in the bathtub.\n* '''Wallace''' is a [[walrus]].

He sleeps along with KoKo in the living room.\n* '''The Bunnies''' are dozens of [[rabbit]]s in different colors. The Bunnies are green, orange, blue, pink, and many more bright colors. The Bunnies do not speak but they squeak and giggle all the time. They usually give out kisses when they are happy. They sleep everywhere in the house. Almost none of them are officially named, as Willa simply refers to them as \"bunny\" or \"the bunnies\".\n* '''Bert''' is a [[bear]]. Before Bert lived with Willa and the other animals he lived in Russia. He is usually seen sleeping. Bert sleeps along with KoKo and Samuel in the living room.\n* '''Tiny and Lou''' are [[elephant]]s. Of all the animals Tiny and Lou are the most immature. Tiny is blue and has a high-pitched voice while Lou is yellow and has a low-pitched voice. It is unknown if Tiny and Lou are brothers. They do not like to give elephant rides unless Willa wants them to. Tiny and Lou sleep in the garage.\n* '''Susu, Kuku and Lulu''' are Sara, Kara and Lara's pet [[poodle]]s. Susu is red, showing that she is Sara's dog. Kuku is purple, showing that she is Kara's dog. Lulu is green, showing that she is Lara's dog. Like their owners, Sara, Kara and Lara, Susu, Kuku and Lulu are snooty.\n* '''Sparkle''' is Evelyn's pet [[spider]]. Sparkle is orange, red and female.

It is about a  girl named Willa ([[Jordan Todosey]]) who has a giraffe, a camel, two elephants, an alligator, and many more zoo animals. The series originally aired on [[Qubo]] in the United States (which has been put back on Qubo's schedule as of 2019), [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]] in Canada and [[France 3]] in France. The series is Flash-animated with Toon Boom Harmony.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===People===\n* '''Willa''' is the main character of the series, who has many exotic animals much to her father's discomfort. She also has lots of wacky adventures and learns lessons along the way. Because of her adventures, she often gets into trouble. Willa is kindhearted and caring and never tries to hurt her friends' feelings. She is usually seen with a green shirt, a red jumper and a green headband. She appears in every episode and is voiced by [[Jordan Todosey]].\n* '''Dooley''' is Willa's next-door neighbor and best friend. Dooley often gets caught up in Willa's adventures. He helps Willa learn lessons during their adventures. Dooley is usually seen wearing a purple T-shirt, yellow pants and thick, round glasses. He is voiced by [[Samantha Reynolds]].\n* '''Dad''' is Willa's single father. Dad is uncomfortable with the animals around the house, but knowing how Willa cares for them and how helpful they can be, he lets her keep them. He helps Willa learn lessons along the way. He is usually seen with an orange vest, long-sleeved blue shirt, brown pants, and glasses. He loves and cares for Willa. He apparently has a crush on Ms. Vanderwinkle. His real name is never revealed. And there's no enough evidence to know who's Willa's mother. It's either Willa's parents are divorced or her mother died.\n* '''Sara, Kara, and Lara''' are friends (for over a year<ref>{{cite episode |title=Party Animals |series=Willa's Wild Life |author=Sara |quote=I still can't believe it's been a whole year since we met}}</ref>) who look, dress, and act the same and think they are cooler than everyone.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Party Animals |series=Willa's Wild Life |author=Kara |quote=And discovered how much cooler we are than everybody else!}}</ref> They often bully Willa, Dooley and Evelyn, and use the wrong names, calling Willa \"Wanda/Wendy/Willetta/Wilma/Winifred/Winona\" and Dooley \"Danny/Dickie/Donnie\". They are members of the dance club, practice ballet<ref>{{cite episode |title=Willa Willa Everywhere |series=Willa's Wild Life}}</ref> and all own dogs.\n**'''Sara''' has a pale skin tone and long blonde hair, red lipstick and pink clothes. She has a red poodle named Susu.\n**'''Kara''' has a light skin tone and long red hair, purple lipstick and purple clothes. She has a purple poodle named Kuku.\n**'''Lara''' is African-American and has long brown hair, green lipstick and green clothes. She has a green poodle named Lulu.\n* '''Evelyn''' is Willa's friend. Evelyn frequently gets into Willa's adventures. She seems to be grumpy all the time and gets discouraged easily. With Willa and Dooley's help, she learns to have fun and be happy. Evelyn is tall, has red hair and is usually seen wearing a long-sleeved turquoise shirt, and capri blue jeans.\n* '''Mr. Tremble''' is the assistant principal at Willa's class. Mr. Tremble easily gets into Willa's adventures. He is usually seen wearing an orange toupee, a brown jacket and blue pants. When he is in Willa's adventures, he often loses his toupee.\n* '''Ms. Delilah Vanderwinkle''' is Willa's other next-door neighbor. Ms. Vanderwinkle is usually seen with a long-sleeved pink shirt, a flowered dress, and cat-eye glasses. She has an orange cat named Tangerine, and a nephew named Buzzy whom Willa babysits in \"Baby It's You.\" Ms. Vanderwinkle's first name was revealed in \"Willa & Dooley Sitting in a Tree.\"\n* '''The Mailman''' appears in some episodes and is mostly scared by Gus.\n* '''Tiffy Tootle''' is a famous blonde-haired girl with decorative pigtails. Tiffy makes her only appearance in ''Willa's Wonderful Life'' and near the end of this episode, she sees her biggest fan Willa and her family makes pizzas.\n\n===Animals===\n* '''Gus''' is an [[alligator]]. He is rude and obnoxious. Whenever he has a chance, he tries to eat the Bunnies, but is always caught by either Willa or one of the other animals. He sleeps under Willa's bed. Gus is always hungry, being an alligator. He is voiced by [[Danny Wells]].\n* '''Jenny''' is a [[giraffe]]. Jenny is the wisest of the animals. She helps Willa during her adventures and acts as a mother figure to Willa since Willa's mother is not around. Due to her size, Jenny sleeps outside.\n* '''Inky, Blinky, and Bob''' are [[penguin]]s. Inky, Blinky, and Bob are the least intelligent of all the animals. Bob cannot speak, he just makes gestures accompanied by trombone sounds. They call Willa \"Gladys.\" They are very good at ice skating. They sleep in the freezer. They also have a love for herrings, like hoe real-life penguins eat herrings for survival. In every episode they are always involved with something. They are voiced by Dwayne Hill and Jay T. Schramek.\n* '''KoKo''' is a [[kangaroo]] from Australia. She has a pink bow on her head and keeps many things in her pouch. For instance, she keeps makeup products, scissors and a signed photograph of a famous kangaroo named Willard Wallaby. She sleeps in the living room. KoKo is the girliest of the animals. She is voiced by Katie Bergin.\n* '''Steve and Edie''' are two [[Pinniped|seals]] that used to be in show business before living with Willa. Steve's skin is darker than Edie's. Edie has a flower hair clip on her head. They give a performance every week in Willa's backyard and are talented musicians. They sleep in the bathtub.\n* '''Wallace''' is a [[walrus]]. Wallace is the oldest of all the animals. He likes to tell stories about his adventures in the Arctic before moving in with Willa. He sleeps with Steve and Edie in the bathtub.\n* '''Samuel''' is a [[camel]]. Samuel is the most sophisticated of the animals. Willa rides on his back to school every day. He sleeps along with KoKo in the living room.\n* '''The Bunnies''' are dozens of [[rabbit]]s in different colors. The Bunnies are green, orange, blue, pink, and many more bright colors. The Bunnies do not speak but they squeak and giggle all the time. They usually give out kisses when they are happy. They sleep everywhere in the house. Almost none of them are officially named, as Willa simply refers to them as \"bunny\" or \"the bunnies\".\n* '''Bert''' is a [[bear]]. Before Bert lived with Willa and the other animals he lived in Russia. He is usually seen sleeping. Bert sleeps along with KoKo and Samuel in the living room.\n* '''Tiny and Lou''' are [[elephant]]s. Of all the animals Tiny and Lou are the most immature. Tiny is blue and has a high-pitched voice while Lou is yellow and has a low-pitched voice. It is unknown if Tiny and Lou are brothers. They do not like to give elephant rides unless Willa wants them to. Tiny and Lou sleep in the garage.\n* '''Susu, Kuku and Lulu''' are Sara, Kara and Lara's pet [[poodle]]s. Susu is red, showing that she is Sara's dog. Kuku is purple, showing that she is Kara's dog. Lulu is green, showing that she is Lara's dog. Like their owners, Sara, Kara and Lara, Susu, Kuku and Lulu are snooty.\n* '''Sparkle''' is Evelyn's pet [[spider]]. Sparkle is orange, red and female. Sparkle only appears in ''Spider Girl.''\n* '''Tangerine''' is Ms. Vanderwinkle's pet [[cat]]. Tangerine is orange. Tangerine only appears in ''Over the Fence.''\n\n==Episodes==\n{| class=wikitable style=\"background:#FFFFFF\"\n! style=\"background:#FFD700; width:20px\"| N\u00ba\n! style=\"background:#FFD700\"|

Pell also spoke in praise of the Jewish [[psalms]] as \"a body of prayerful literature\" unequalled in any other tradition and singled out the Jewish prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel as authors for whom he has a deep love and Elijah as one whom he views as highly significant. Pell called on Christian and Jewish leaders alike to speak together and respectfully listen to each other, saying of the Christian-Jewish relationship:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sydneycatholic.org/people/archbishop/addresses/2001/2001514_866.shtml |title=Christians & Jews: the way ahead |publisher=Catholic Archdiocese of Sydney |last=Pell |first=George |date=14 May 2001 |accessdate=23 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208170615/http://www.sydneycatholic.org/people/archbishop/addresses/2001/2001514_866.shtml |archive-date=8 February 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n{{quote|During the last 30 or 40 years there has been a significant reduction in the amount of Christian anti-Semitism.

He came to the poor and the battlers\".

Justice Weinberg issued a dissenting judgment and would have allowed the appeal on the first ground.<ref name=\"VCA dismissal\" />\n\nWhilst Chief Justice Ferguson and Justice Maxwell stated that they \"did not experience a doubt\" in the case, the dissenting Judge Weinberg likened the case to that of [[Lindy Chamberlain]], which had seen wrongful conviction by a jury and appeal court based on faulty evidence:<ref>[https://www.msn.com/en-au/news/australia/dissenting-judge-used-lindy-chamberlains-case-to-dismiss-guilty-pell-verdict/ar-AAGa8h1 \"Dissenting judge used Lindy Chamberlain's case to dismiss guilty Pell verdict\"], www.msn.com, 22 August 2019.</ref><ref>[https://www.supremecourt.vic.gov.au/case-summaries/court-of-appeal-proceedings/george-pell-v-the-queen \"George Pell v The Queen\"], Victorian Court of Appeal.</ref> Weinberg wrote that \"there is, to my mind, a 'significant possibility' that the applicant in this case may not have committed these offences. That means that, in my respectful opinion, these convictions cannot be permitted to stand.

In relation to the second ground, Chief Justice Ferguson described the visual aid that Pell's lawyer sought to present in his closing address as tendentious, as potentially misleading or confusing and as including material that was unsupported by evidence in the trial record. The court ruled that the trial judge had been correct to exclude it. In relation to the third ground, the court ruled that the requirement for the jury to be present during arraignment did not require physical presence and that presence via video link (as was the case here) was adequate to satisfy this requirement.<ref name=\"VCA dismissal\" />\n\nOn 17 September, Pell sought special leave to appeal to the [[High Court of Australia]], the final court of appeal in Australia.<ref>There is no automatic right to appeal to the High Court; special leave is always required.</ref><ref name=\"HCA appeal lodge ABCNews\">{{cite news |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-09-17/george-pell-to-appeal-to-the-high-court/11437796 |title=George Pell seeks leave to appeal child sex abuse convictions in High Court |first=Sarah |last=Farnsworth |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date=17 September 2019 |access-date=17 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/choirboy-can-be-believed-and-pell-freed-cardinal-s-lawyers-say-20190920-p52t8f.html|last=Le Grand|first=Chip|title=Choirboy can be believed \u2013 and Pell freed, Cardinal's lawyers say|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=20 September 2019|accessdate=20 September 2019}}</ref> On 13 November, two justices of the High Court referred the decision on leave to appeal to a full court \"for argument as on an appeal\".<ref name=\"HCA appeal grant\">{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/HCATrans/2019/217.html |title=Pell v The Queen [2019] HCATrans 217 (13 November 2019) |website=High Court of Australia Transcripts |date=13 November 2019 |accessdate=13 November 2019}}  This decision was made \"on the papers\".

Justice Weinberg issued a dissenting judgment and would have allowed the appeal on the first ground.<ref name=\"VCA dismissal\" />\n\nWhilst Chief Justice Ferguson and Justice Maxwell stated that they \"did not experience a doubt\" in the case, the dissenting Judge Weinberg likened the case to that of [[Lindy Chamberlain]], which had seen wrongful conviction by a jury and appeal court based on faulty evidence:<ref>[https://www.msn.com/en-au/news/australia/dissenting-judge-used-lindy-chamberlains-case-to-dismiss-guilty-pell-verdict/ar-AAGa8h1 \"Dissenting judge used Lindy Chamberlain's case to dismiss guilty Pell verdict\"], www.msn.com, 22 August 2019.</ref><ref>[https://www.supremecourt.vic.gov.au/case-summaries/court-of-appeal-proceedings/george-pell-v-the-queen \"George Pell v The Queen\"], Victorian Court of Appeal.</ref> Weinberg wrote that \"there is, to my mind, a 'significant possibility' that the applicant in this case may not have committed these offences.

In relation to the second ground, Chief Justice Ferguson described the visual aid that Pell's lawyer sought to present in his closing address as tendentious, as potentially misleading or confusing and as including material that was unsupported by evidence in the trial record. The court ruled that the trial judge had been correct to exclude it. In relation to the third ground, the court ruled that the requirement for the jury to be present during arraignment did not require physical presence and that presence via video link (as was the case here) was adequate to satisfy this requirement.<ref name=\"VCA dismissal\" />\n\nOn 17 September, Pell sought special leave to appeal to the [[High Court of Australia]], the final court of appeal in Australia.<ref>There is no automatic right to appeal to the High Court; special leave is always required.</ref><ref name=\"HCA appeal lodge ABCNews\">{{cite news |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-09-17/george-pell-to-appeal-to-the-high-court/11437796 |title=George Pell seeks leave to appeal child sex abuse convictions in High Court |first=Sarah |last=Farnsworth |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date=17 September 2019 |access-date=17 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/choirboy-can-be-believed-and-pell-freed-cardinal-s-lawyers-say-20190920-p52t8f.html|last=Le Grand|first=Chip|title=Choirboy can be believed \u2013 and Pell freed, Cardinal's lawyers say|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=20 September 2019|accessdate=20 September 2019}}</ref> On 13 November, two justices of the High Court referred the decision on leave to appeal to a full court \"for argument as on an appeal\".<ref name=\"HCA appeal grant\">{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/HCATrans/2019/217.html |title=Pell v The Queen [2019] HCATrans 217 (13 November 2019) |website=High Court of Australia Transcripts |date=13 November 2019 |accessdate=13 November 2019}}  This decision was made \"on the papers\".
