It told the story of a bald villain with [[telepathy|telepathic]] powers. Trying to create a character they could sell to newspaper syndicates, Siegel re-conceived the \"superman\" character as a powerful hero, sent to our world from a more advanced society. He and Shuster developed the idea into a comic strip, which they pitched unsuccessfully.\n\nNational Publications was looking for a hit to accompany their success with ''[[Detective Comics]]'', and did not have time to solicit new material. Jack Liebowitz, co-owner of National Publications, told editor [[Vin Sullivan]] to create their fourth comic book. Because of the tight deadline, Sullivan was forced to make it out of inventory and stockpile pages. He found a number of adventurer stories, but needed a lead feature. Sullivan asked former coworker Sheldon Mayer if he could help.

It told the story of a bald villain with [[telepathy|telepathic]] powers. Trying to create a character they could sell to newspaper syndicates, Siegel re-conceived the \"superman\" character as a powerful hero, sent to our world from a more advanced society. He and Shuster developed the idea into a comic strip, which they pitched unsuccessfully.\n\nNational Publications was looking for a hit to accompany their success with ''[[Detective Comics]]'', and did not have time to solicit new material. Jack Liebowitz, co-owner of National Publications, told editor [[Vin Sullivan]] to create their fourth comic book. Because of the tight deadline, Sullivan was forced to make it out of inventory and stockpile pages. He found a number of adventurer stories, but needed a lead feature. Sullivan asked former coworker Sheldon Mayer if he could help.

Born in [[Gilmore, Ohio]], he worked on his family's farm as a youth before starting his professional baseball career. Young entered the major leagues in 1890 with the [[National League]]'s [[Cleveland Spiders]] and pitched for them until 1898. He was then transferred to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] franchise. In 1901, Young jumped to the [[American League]] and played for the [[Boston Red Sox]] franchise until 1908, helping them win the [[1903 World Series]]. He finished his career with the [[Cleveland Indians|Cleveland Naps]] and [[Boston Rustlers]], retiring in 1911.\n\nYoung was one of the hardest-throwing pitchers in the game early in his career. After his speed diminished, he relied more on his control and remained effective into his forties. By the time Young retired, he had established numerous pitching records, some of which have stood for over a century. He holds MLB records for the most career wins, with 511, along with most career [[innings pitched]], [[games started]], and [[complete game]]s. He led his league in wins during five seasons and pitched three [[no-hitter]]s, including a [[Perfect game (baseball)|perfect game]].\n\nYoung was elected to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]] in [[1937 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|1937]]. In 1956, one year after his death, the [[Cy Young Award]] was created to honor the best pitcher in each league for each season.\n\n==Early life==\nCy Young was the oldest child born to McKinzie Young, Jr. a [[German American]] and Nancy Mottmiller. He was christened Denton True Young. The couple had four more children: Jesse Carlton, Alonzo, Ella, and Anthony. When the couple married, McKinzie's father gave him the {{convert|54|acre|m2}} of farm land he owned.<ref name=browning>{{cite book |last= Browning |first= Reed |title= Cy Young: A Baseball Life |publisher= Univ of Massachusetts Press |year= 2003 |isbn= 1-55849-398-0}}</ref> Young was born in Gilmore, a tiny farming community located in [[Washington Township, Tuscarawas County, Ohio]].  \n\nHe was raised on one of the local farms and went by the name Dent Young in his early years.<ref name=bio>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmgworldwide.com/baseball/young/biography.htm |title=Cy Young Biography |accessdate=June 14, 2007 |publisher=CMG Worldwide |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070602024410/http://www.cmgworldwide.com/baseball/young/biography.htm |archivedate = June 2, 2007}}</ref> Young was also known as \"Farmer Young\" and \"Farmboy Young\".

Young pitched and played second base. The first box score known containing the name Young came from that season. In that game, Young played first base and had three hits in three at-bats.

Young did not walk a batter and was later quoted: \"For my part, I think it was the greatest game of ball I ever took part in.\"<ref name=waddell>{{cite web|url=http://www.philadelphiaathletics.org/history/rubevscy.htm |title=Waddell vs Young |accessdate=June 23, 2007 |work=By Daniel O\u2019Brien |publisher=Philadelphia Athletics |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626103928/http://www.philadelphiaathletics.org/history/rubevscy.htm |archivedate=June 26, 2007 }}</ref> In 1907, Young and Waddell faced off in a scoreless 13-inning tie.\n\nIn 1908, Young pitched the third no-hitter of his career. Three months past his 41st birthday, Cy Young was the oldest pitcher to record a no-hitter, a record which would stand 82 years until 43-year-old [[Nolan Ryan]] surpassed the feat. Only a walk kept Young from his second perfect game. After that runner was caught stealing, no other batter reached base. At this time, Young was the second-oldest player in either league. In another game one month before his no-hitter, he allowed just one single while facing 28 batters.<ref name=\"Chronology\"/> On August 13, 1908, the league celebrated \"Cy Young Day.\" No American League games were played on that day, and a group of All-Stars from the league's other teams gathered in Boston to play against Young and the Red Sox.<ref>{{cite web| title = Cy Young Day | work = brainyhistory.com | url=http://www.brainyhistory.com/events/1908/august_13_1908_72365.html | accessdate = November 11, 2006 }}</ref> When the season ended, he posted a 1.26 ERA, which gave him not only the lowest in his career, but also gave him a major league record of being the oldest pitcher with 150+ innings pitched to post a season ERA under 1.50.\n\n===Cleveland Naps and retirement===\nYoung was traded back to Cleveland, the place where he played over half his career, before the 1909 season, to the [[Cleveland Naps]] of the American League. The following season, 1910, he won his 500th career game on July 19 against Washington.<ref>[http://www.baseball-almanac.com/teamstats/schedule.php?y=1910&t=CL91910 Cleveland Naps Schedule] Baseball Almanac.

His career high was 36 in 1892. He won at least thirty games in a season five times. He had fifteen seasons with twenty or more wins, two more than the runners-up, [[Christy Mathewson]] and [[Warren Spahn]]. Young won two [[Earned run average|ERA]] titles during his career, in 1892 (1.93) and in 1901 (1.62), and was three times the runner-up. Young's earned run average was below 2.00 six times, but this was not uncommon during the [[dead-ball era]]. Although Young threw over 400 innings in each of his first four full seasons, he did not lead his league until 1902. He had 40 or more complete games nine times. Young also led his league in strikeouts twice (with 140 in 1896, and 158 in 1901), and in shutouts seven times.<ref name=stats/> Young led his league in fewest walks per nine innings fourteen times and finished second one season. Only twice in his 22-year career did Young finish lower than 5th in the category. Although the [[Walks plus hits per inning pitched|WHIP]] ratio was not calculated until well after Young's death, Young was the retroactive league leader in this category seven times and was second or third another seven times.<ref name=stats/> Young is tied with [[Roger Clemens]] for the most career wins by a Boston Red Sox pitcher.

He posted a .210 [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] (623-for-2960) with 325 [[run (baseball)|runs]], 18 [[home runs]], 290 [[RBI]] and drew 81 [[bases on balls]]. From 1891 through 1905, he drove in 10 or more runs for 15 straight seasons, with a high of 28 RBI in 1896.<ref name=\"stats\" />\n\n===Pitching style===\nParticularly after his fastball slowed, Young relied upon his control. Young was once quoted as saying, \"Some may have thought it was essential to know how to curve a ball before anything else. Experience, to my mind, teaches to the contrary. Any young player who has good control will become a successful curve pitcher long before the pitcher who is endeavoring to master both curves and control at the same time. The curve is merely an accessory to control.\"<ref name=quotes /> In addition to his exceptional control, Young was also a workhorse who avoided injury. For nineteen consecutive years, from 1891 through 1909, Young was in his league's top ten for innings pitched; in fourteen of the seasons, he was in the top five. Not until 1900, a decade into his career, did Young pitch two consecutive incomplete games.<ref name=1897chron /> By habit, Young restricted his practice throws in [[spring training]]. \"I figured the old arm had just so many throws in it\", said Young, \"and there wasn't any use wasting them.\" Young once described his approach before a game:\n<blockquote>I never warmed up ten, fifteen minutes before a game like most pitchers do. I'd loosen up, three, four minutes. Five at the outside. And I never went to the bullpen. Oh, I'd relieve all right, plenty of times, but I went right from the bench to the box, and I'd take a few warm-up pitches and be ready. Then I had good control. I aimed to make the batter hit the ball, and I threw as few pitches as possible. That's why I was able to work every other day.<ref name=quotes /></blockquote>\n\n==Later life==\nBeginning in 1912, Young lived and worked on his farm. In 1913, he served as manager of the Cleveland Green Sox of the [[Federal League]], which was at the time an outlaw league. However, he never worked in baseball after that.\n\nYoung's wife, Roba,<ref>[[:File:Cy Young, Roba Miller Young Tombstone.JPG]]</ref> whom he had known since childhood, died in 1933.<ref name=browning/><ref name=dugout/> After she died, Young tried several jobs, and eventually moved in with friends John and Ruth Benedum and did odd jobs for them. Young took part in many baseball events after his retirement.<ref name=dugout/> In 1937, 26 years after he retired from baseball, Young was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. He was among the first to donate mementos to the Hall.\n\nBy 1940, Young's only source of income was stock dividends of $300 per year (${{Inflation|US|300|1940|fmt=c}} today).<ref name=browning/><ref>{{cite web|title=1940 United States Census \u2013 Denton Young|url=https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/KWGZ-T1S|accessdate=April 13, 2014}}</ref>  On November 4, 1955, Young died on the Benedums' farm at the age of 88.<ref name=browning/> He was buried in [[Peoli, Ohio]].<ref>{{cite web| title = Cy Young | work = Retrosheet| url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/Y/Pyounc102.htm | accessdate = November 11, 2006 }}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Cy Young HOF plaque.jpg|thumb|Young's plaque at the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum]]]]\nYoung's career is seen as a bridge from baseball's earliest days to its modern era; he pitched against stars such as [[Cap Anson]], already an established player when the [[National League]] was first formed in 1876, as well as against [[Eddie Collins]], who played until 1930. When Young's career began, pitchers delivered the baseball underhand and fouls were not counted as strikes. The pitcher's mound was not moved back to its present position of {{convert|60|ft|6|in|m}} until Young's fourth season; he did not wear a glove until his sixth season.<ref name=dugout/>\n\nYoung was elected to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]] in [[1937 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|1937]]. In 1956, about one year after Young's death, the Cy Young Award was created to honor the best pitcher in Major League Baseball for each season. The first award was given to Brooklyn's [[Don Newcombe]]. Originally, it was a single award covering all of baseball. The honor was divided into two Cy Young Awards in 1967, one for each league.\n\nOn September 23, 1993, a statue dedicated to him was unveiled by [[Northeastern University]] on the site of the Red Sox's original stadium, the [[Huntington Avenue Grounds]]. It was there that Young had pitched the first game of the 1903 World Series, as well as the first perfect game in the modern era of baseball.  A home plate-shaped plaque next to the statue reads:\n<blockquote>\nOn October 1, 1903 the first modern World Series between the American League champion Boston Pilgrims (later known as the Red Sox) and the National League champion Pittsburgh Pirates was played on this site. General admission tickets were fifty cents. The Pilgrims, led by twenty-eight game winner Cy Young, trailed the series three games to one but then swept four consecutive victories to win the championship five games to three.<ref>{{cite news|author=Boston's Pastime|title=Huntington Avenue Grounds: The Pre-Fenway Era |url=http://www.bostonspastime.com/stories/huntington.html|accessdate=2009-05-20 }}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn 1999, 88 years after his final major league appearance and 44 years after his death, editors at ''[[The Sporting News]]'' ranked Young 14th on their list of \"Baseball's 100 Greatest Players\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/legendary/lisn100.shtml |title=Baseball's 100 Greatest Players |accessdate=July 16, 2008 |work=[[The Sporting News]] |date= }}</ref> That same year, baseball fans named him to the [[Major League Baseball All-Century Team]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biography|Baseball}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[300 win club]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball career wins leaders]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball career ERA leaders]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball career strikeout leaders]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball career shutout leaders]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball career hit batsmen leaders]]\n* [[Triple Crown (baseball)]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball annual wins leaders]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball annual ERA leaders]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball annual strikeout leaders]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball annual shutout leaders]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball annual saves leaders]]\n* [[Major League Baseball titles leaders]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball no-hitters]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball individual streaks]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball player-managers]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball all-time leaders in home runs by pitchers]]\n* [[Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n* '''a.'''{{note label|A|a|none}}{{ref label|A|a2|none}}{{ref label|A|a3|none}} Although the phrase \"perfect game\" appeared in record books as early as 1922, and was a common expression years before that, Major League Baseball did not formalize the definition of a \"perfect game\" until 1991, long after Young's death.

1955) was an American [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) [[pitcher]]. Born in [[Gilmore, Ohio]], he worked on his family's farm as a youth before starting his professional baseball career. Young entered the major leagues in 1890 with the [[National League]]'s [[Cleveland Spiders]] and pitched for them until 1898. He was then transferred to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] franchise. In 1901, Young jumped to the [[American League]] and played for the [[Boston Red Sox]] franchise until 1908, helping them win the [[1903 World Series]]. He finished his career with the [[Cleveland Indians|Cleveland Naps]] and [[Boston Rustlers]], retiring in 1911.\n\nYoung was one of the hardest-throwing pitchers in the game early in his career. After his speed diminished, he relied more on his control and remained effective into his forties. By the time Young retired, he had established numerous pitching records, some of which have stood for over a century. He holds MLB records for the most career wins, with 511, along with most career [[innings pitched]], [[games started]], and [[complete game]]s. He led his league in wins during five seasons and pitched three [[no-hitter]]s, including a [[Perfect game (baseball)|perfect game]].\n\nYoung was elected to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]] in [[1937 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|1937]]. In 1956, one year after his death, the [[Cy Young Award]] was created to honor the best pitcher in each league for each season.\n\n==Early life==\nCy Young was the oldest child born to McKinzie Young, Jr. a [[German American]] and Nancy Mottmiller. He was christened Denton True Young. The couple had four more children: Jesse Carlton, Alonzo, Ella, and Anthony. When the couple married, McKinzie's father gave him the {{convert|54|acre|m2}} of farm land he owned.<ref name=browning>{{cite book |last= Browning |first= Reed |title= Cy Young: A Baseball Life |publisher= Univ of Massachusetts Press |year= 2003 |isbn= 1-55849-398-0}}</ref> Young was born in Gilmore, a tiny farming community located in [[Washington Township, Tuscarawas County, Ohio]].  \n\nHe was raised on one of the local farms and went by the name Dent Young in his early years.<ref name=bio>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmgworldwide.com/baseball/young/biography.htm |title=Cy Young Biography |accessdate=June 14, 2007 |publisher=CMG Worldwide |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070602024410/http://www.cmgworldwide.com/baseball/young/biography.htm |archivedate = June 2, 2007}}</ref> Young was also known as \"Farmer Young\" and \"Farmboy Young\".

In 1885, Young moved with his father to [[Nebraska]], and in the summer of 1887, they returned to Gilmore.\n\nYoung played for many amateur baseball leagues during his youth, including a semi-professional [[Carrollton, Ohio|Carrollton]] team in 1888. Young pitched and played second base. The first box score known containing the name Young came from that season. In that game, Young played first base and had three hits in three at-bats. After the season, Young received an offer to play for the minor league [[Canton, Ohio|Canton]] team, which started Young's professional career.<ref name=browning/>\n\n==Professional baseball career==\n\n===Minor leagues===\nYoung began his professional career in 1889 with the [[Canton, Ohio]], team of the [[Tri-State League]], a professional minor league.

For nineteen consecutive years, from 1891 through 1909, Young was in his league's top ten for innings pitched; in fourteen of the seasons, he was in the top five. Not until 1900, a decade into his career, did Young pitch two consecutive incomplete games.<ref name=1897chron /> By habit, Young restricted his practice throws in [[spring training]]. \"I figured the old arm had just so many throws in it\", said Young, \"and there wasn't any use wasting them.\" Young once described his approach before a game:\n<blockquote>I never warmed up ten, fifteen minutes before a game like most pitchers do. I'd loosen up, three, four minutes. Five at the outside. And I never went to the bullpen. Oh, I'd relieve all right, plenty of times, but I went right from the bench to the box, and I'd take a few warm-up pitches and be ready. Then I had good control. I aimed to make the batter hit the ball, and I threw as few pitches as possible. That's why I was able to work every other day.<ref name=quotes /></blockquote>\n\n==Later life==\nBeginning in 1912, Young lived and worked on his farm.

The pitcher's mound was not moved back to its present position of {{convert|60|ft|6|in|m}} until Young's fourth season; he did not wear a glove until his sixth season.<ref name=dugout/>\n\nYoung was elected to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]] in [[1937 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|1937]]. In 1956, about one year after Young's death, the Cy Young Award was created to honor the best pitcher in Major League Baseball for each season. The first award was given to Brooklyn's [[Don Newcombe]]. Originally, it was a single award covering all of baseball. The honor was divided into two Cy Young Awards in 1967, one for each league.\n\nOn September 23, 1993, a statue dedicated to him was unveiled by [[Northeastern University]] on the site of the Red Sox's original stadium, the [[Huntington Avenue Grounds]]. It was there that Young had pitched the first game of the 1903 World Series, as well as the first perfect game in the modern era of baseball.  A home plate-shaped plaque next to the statue reads:\n<blockquote>\nOn October 1, 1903 the first modern World Series between the American League champion Boston Pilgrims (later known as the Red Sox) and the National League champion Pittsburgh Pirates was played on this site. General admission tickets were fifty cents. The Pilgrims, led by twenty-eight game winner Cy Young, trailed the series three games to one but then swept four consecutive victories to win the championship five games to three.<ref>{{cite news|author=Boston's Pastime|title=Huntington Avenue Grounds: The Pre-Fenway Era |url=http://www.bostonspastime.com/stories/huntington.html|accessdate=2009-05-20 }}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn 1999, 88 years after his final major league appearance and 44 years after his death, editors at ''[[The Sporting News]]'' ranked Young 14th on their list of \"Baseball's 100 Greatest Players\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/legendary/lisn100.shtml |title=Baseball's 100 Greatest Players |accessdate=July 16, 2008 |work=[[The Sporting News]] |date= }}</ref> That same year, baseball fans named him to the [[Major League Baseball All-Century Team]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biography|Baseball}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[300 win club]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball career wins leaders]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball career ERA leaders]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball career strikeout leaders]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball career shutout leaders]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball career hit batsmen leaders]]\n* [[Triple Crown (baseball)]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball annual wins leaders]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball annual ERA leaders]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball annual strikeout leaders]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball annual shutout leaders]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball annual saves leaders]]\n* [[Major League Baseball titles leaders]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball no-hitters]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball individual streaks]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball player-managers]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball all-time leaders in home runs by pitchers]]\n* [[Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n* '''a.'''{{note label|A|a|none}}{{ref label|A|a2|none}}{{ref label|A|a3|none}} Although the phrase \"perfect game\" appeared in record books as early as 1922, and was a common expression years before that, Major League Baseball did not formalize the definition of a \"perfect game\" until 1991, long after Young's death.

The day after Thanksgiving has been regarded as the beginning of the United States [[Economics of Christmas|Christmas shopping season]] since 1952, although the term \"Black Friday\" did not become widely used until more recent decades.\n\nMany stores offer highly promoted sales on Black Friday and open very early, such as at midnight, or may even start their sales at some time on [[Thanksgiving]]. Black Friday is not an official holiday, but California and some other states observe \"The Day After Thanksgiving\" as a holiday for [[state government]] employees, sometimes in lieu of another federal holiday, such as [[Columbus Day]]. Many non-retail employees and schools have both Thanksgiving and the following Friday off, which, along with the following regular weekend, makes it a four-day weekend, thereby increasing the number of potential shoppers.\n\nBlack Friday has routinely been the busiest shopping day of the year in the [[United States]] since 2005,<ref name=\"holiday.icsc.org\">{{cite web |url=http://holiday.icsc.org/2006/hw06_fullguide.pdf |title=Holiday Watch: Media Guide 2006 Holiday Facts and Figure |author=International Council of Shopping Centers |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129122823/http://shoppertrak.com/shoppertrak-reports-positive-response-early-holiday-promotions-boosts-projections-2010-holiday-seaso |archivedate=November 29, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}; ShopperTrak, Press Release,{{cite web |url=http://shoppertrak.com/shoppertrak-reports-positive-response-early-holiday-promotions-boosts-projections-2010-holiday-seaso |title=ShopperTrak Reports Positive Response to Early Holiday Promotions Boosts Projections for 2010 Holiday Season |accessdate=2012-01-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129122823/http://shoppertrak.com/shoppertrak-reports-positive-response-early-holiday-promotions-boosts-projections-2010-holiday-seaso |archivedate=November 29, 2010 |df=mdy }} (November 16, 2010).</ref> although news reports, which at that time were inaccurate,<ref name=\"International Council of Shopping Centers\">{{cite web|url=http://www.icsc.org/TopTen02.pdf|title=Daily Sales Comparison Top Ten Holiday Shopping Days (1996\u20132001)|author=International Council of Shopping Centers|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112114831/http://www.icsc.org/TopTen02.pdf|archivedate=January 12, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> have described it as the busiest shopping day of the year for a much longer period of time.<ref name=\"Albert R.

When President Grant learned of this manipulation, he ordered the Treasury to release a large supply of gold, which halted the run and caused prices to drop by eighteen percent. Fortunes were made and lost in a single day, and the president's own brother-in-law, [[Abel Corbin]], was ruined.\n\nThe earliest known use of \"Black Friday\" to refer to the day after Thanksgiving occurred in the journal, ''[[Engineering Magazine|Factory Management and Maintenance]]'', for November 1951, and again in 1952. Here it referred to the practice of workers calling in sick on the day after Thanksgiving, in order to have a four-day weekend. However, this use does not appear to have caught on. Around the same time, the terms \"Black Friday\" and \"Black Saturday\" came to be used by the police in Philadelphia and [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] to describe the crowds and traffic congestion accompanying the start of the Christmas shopping season. In 1961, the city and merchants of Philadelphia attempted to improve conditions, and a public relations expert recommended rebranding the days, \"Big Friday\" and \"Big Saturday\"; but these terms were quickly forgotten.<ref name=\"Zimmer\" /><ref name=\"linguistlist239\" /><ref name=\"snopes\">{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/holidays/thanksgiving/blackfriday.asp |title=snopes.com: How Did 'Black Friday' Get Its Name? |work= Urban Legends Reference Pages |publisher= Snopes.com |access-date=November 28, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= http://listserv.linguistlist.org/pipermail/ads-l/2014-November/135115.html |title= Around and About |work= The Shortsville-Manchester Enterprise |date= December 1, 1961 |page= 4}}</ref>\n\nUse of the phrase spread slowly, first appearing in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on November 29, 1975, in which it still refers specifically to \"the busiest shopping and traffic day of the year\" in Philadelphia.

This was debunked by [[Snopes.com]] in 2015.<ref name=\"snopes\" />\n\n== History ==\n\nThe day after Thanksgiving as the unofficial start of the holiday shopping season may be linked together with the idea of [[Santa Claus parades]]. Parades celebrating Thanksgiving often include an appearance by Santa at the end of the parade, with the idea that \"Santa has arrived\" or \"Santa is just around the corner\" because Christmas is always the next major holiday following Thanksgiving.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many Santa or Thanksgiving Day parades were sponsored by department stores. These included the [[Toronto Santa Claus Parade]], in Canada, sponsored by [[Eaton's]], and the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]] sponsored by [[Macy's]]. Department stores would use the parades to launch a big advertising push. Eventually, it just became an unwritten rule that no store would try doing Christmas advertising before the parade was over. Therefore, the day after Thanksgiving became the day when the shopping season officially started.\n\nThanksgiving Day's relationship to Christmas shopping led to controversy in the 1930s. Retail stores would have liked to have a longer shopping season, but no store wanted to break with tradition and be the one to start advertising before Thanksgiving. For this reason, in 1939, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] issued a presidential proclamation proclaiming Thanksgiving to be the fourth Thursday in November rather than the last Thursday, meaning in some years one week earlier, in order to lengthen the Christmas shopping season.<ref name=congressthanks>{{cite web|title=Congress Establishes Thanksgiving|url=https://www.archives.gov/legislative/features/thanksgiving/|access-date=November 15, 2009}}</ref> Most people adopted the President's change, which was later reinforced by an act of Congress, but many continued to celebrate Thanksgiving Day on the traditional date.<ref name=congressthanks /> Some started referring to the new date as [[Franksgiving]].\n\nIn 2015, [[Amazon.com]] held a \"Prime Day\" event in July and promised better deals than on Black Friday, with repeat Prime Days taking place in 2016 and 2017.

In 2009, Kmart opened at 7:00&nbsp;a.m. on Thanksgiving, in order to allow shoppers to avoid Black Friday traffic and return home in time for dinner with their families. Two years later, a number of retailers began opening at 8:00 or 9:00&nbsp;p.m., on what became derisively known as \"Black Thursday\".

As the first day after the last major holiday before Christmas, it marks the unofficial beginning of the Christmas shopping season. Additionally, many employers give their employees the day off as part of the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. In order to take advantage of this, virtually all retailers in the country, big and small, offer various sales including limited amounts of doorbuster/doorcrasher/doorsmasher items to entice traffic. The early 2010s have seen retailers extend beyond normal hours in order to maintain an edge or to simply keep up with the competition. Such hours may include opening as early as 12:00&nbsp;a.m. or remaining open overnight on Thanksgiving Day and beginning sale prices at midnight. In 2010, [[Toys 'R' Us]] began their Black Friday sales at 10:00&nbsp;p.m. on Thanksgiving Day and further upped the ante by offering free boxes of [[Crayola]] crayons and coloring books for as long as supplies lasted. Other retailers, like [[Sears]], Express, MK, [[Victoria's Secret]], [[Zumiez]], [[Tillys]], [[American Eagle Outfitters]], Nike, Jordan, Puma, [[A\u00e9ropostale (clothing)|A\u00e9ropostale]], and [[Kmart]], began Black Friday sales early Thanksgiving morning and ran them through as late as 11:00&nbsp;p.m. Friday evening. [[Forever 21]] went in the opposite direction, opening at normal hours on Friday, and running late sales until 2:00&nbsp;a.m. Saturday morning.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://articles.nydailynews.com/2010-11-23/news/27082005_1_black-friday-doorbusters-thanksgiving-day-stores |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110815091655/http://articles.nydailynews.com/2010-11-23/news/27082005_1_black-friday-doorbusters-thanksgiving-day-stores |url-status= dead |archive-date= August 15, 2011 |location= New York |work= Daily News |title= Black Friday Deals for Target, H&M, Forever21, Old Navy, Radio Shack, and More |first= David |last= Yi |date= November 23, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= http://financiallyfit.yahoo.com/finance/article-111402-7507-6-post-thanksgiving-shopping-starts-earlier?ywaad=ad0035&nc |title= Black Friday Moves to Thursday as Stores Woo Shoppers |work=Yahoo!

Over the past decade, [[Independence day]] sales (on 15 August) have become a large attraction, though most sales in India last for a period of one week.<ref>{{cite news|title=Flipkart Amazon drive psot GST with largest ever Diwali sales|url=https://asia.nikkei.com/magazine/20171012/Business/Flipkart-Amazon-drive-postGST-consumption|accessdate=24 November 2017|publisher=Asia Nikkei|date=12 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe growing number of e-commerce websites and large retail shopping centers has contributed to such sales.

The text listings of items and prices are usually accompanied by pictures of the actual ad circulars. These are either leaked by insiders or intentionally released by large retailers to give consumers insight and allow them time to plan.\n\nIn recent years, some retailers (including [[Walmart]], [[Target Corporation|Target]], [[OfficeMax]], [[Big Lots]], and [[Staples, Inc.|Staples]]) have claimed that the advertisements they send in advance of Black Friday and the prices included in those advertisements are copyrighted and are [[trade secret]]s.<ref>{{cite news |title= Sale fight no fright for area Web site |work= Charleston Gazette & Daily Mail |date= November 26, 2002|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-13802620.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201040308/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-13802620.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 1, 2017|via=HighBeam Research|author=Martyn Chase}}</ref>\n\nSome of these retailers have used the [[Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act|take-down system]] of the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] as a means to remove the offending price listings. This policy may come from the fear that competitors will slash prices, and shoppers may comparison shop. The actual validity of the claim that prices form a protected work of authorship is uncertain as the prices themselves (though not the advertisements) might be considered a fact in which case they would not receive the same level of protection as a copyrighted work.<ref>''[[Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service|Feist Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service Co.]]'', 499 U.S. 340 (1991).</ref>{{original research inline|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe benefit of threatening Internet sites with a DMCA based lawsuit has proved tenuous at best. While some sites have complied with the requests, others have either ignored the threats or simply continued to post the information under the name of a similar-sounding fictional retailer. However, careful timing may mitigate the take-down notice. An [[Internet service provider]] in 2003 brought suit against [[Best Buy]], [[Kohl's]], and [[Target Corporation]], arguing that the take-down notice provisions of the DMCA are unconstitutional. The court dismissed the case, ruling that only the third-party posters of the advertisements, and not the ISP itself, would have [[standing (law)|standing]] to sue the retailers.<ref>''Fatwallet, Inc. v. Best Buy Enterprises Services'', 2004 WL 793548 (N.D.Ill. 2004).</ref>\n\nUsage of Black Friday Advertising Tip sites and buying direct varies by state in the U.S., influenced in large part by differences in shipping costs and whether a state has a sales tax. However, in recent years, the convenience of online shopping has increased the number of cross-border shoppers seeking bargains from outside of the U.S., especially from Canada. Statistics Canada indicates that online cross-border shopping by Canadians has increased by about 300M a year since 2002.<ref name=\"Statscan\">{{cite web |url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-010-x/01207/10464-eng.htm|title=Canadian Economic Observer |publisher= Stats Canada |access-date=March 18, 2010}}</ref> The complex nature of additional fees such as taxes, duties and brokerage can make calculating the final cost of cross-border Black Friday deals difficult.

Black Friday is not an official holiday, but California and some other states observe \"The Day After Thanksgiving\" as a holiday for [[state government]] employees, sometimes in lieu of another federal holiday, such as [[Columbus Day]]. Many non-retail employees and schools have both Thanksgiving and the following Friday off, which, along with the following regular weekend, makes it a four-day weekend, thereby increasing the number of potential shoppers.\n\nBlack Friday has routinely been the busiest shopping day of the year in the [[United States]] since 2005,<ref name=\"holiday.icsc.org\">{{cite web |url=http://holiday.icsc.org/2006/hw06_fullguide.pdf |title=Holiday Watch: Media Guide 2006 Holiday Facts and Figure |author=International Council of Shopping Centers |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129122823/http://shoppertrak.com/shoppertrak-reports-positive-response-early-holiday-promotions-boosts-projections-2010-holiday-seaso |archivedate=November 29, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}; ShopperTrak, Press Release,{{cite web |url=http://shoppertrak.com/shoppertrak-reports-positive-response-early-holiday-promotions-boosts-projections-2010-holiday-seaso |title=ShopperTrak Reports Positive Response to Early Holiday Promotions Boosts Projections for 2010 Holiday Season |accessdate=2012-01-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129122823/http://shoppertrak.com/shoppertrak-reports-positive-response-early-holiday-promotions-boosts-projections-2010-holiday-seaso |archivedate=November 29, 2010 |df=mdy }} (November 16, 2010).</ref> although news reports, which at that time were inaccurate,<ref name=\"International Council of Shopping Centers\">{{cite web|url=http://www.icsc.org/TopTen02.pdf|title=Daily Sales Comparison Top Ten Holiday Shopping Days (1996\u20132001)|author=International Council of Shopping Centers|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112114831/http://www.icsc.org/TopTen02.pdf|archivedate=January 12, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> have described it as the busiest shopping day of the year for a much longer period of time.<ref name=\"Albert R.

Many events have been described as \"Black Friday\", although the most significant such event in American History was the [[Black Friday (1869)|Panic of 1869]], which occurred when financiers [[Jay Gould]] and [[James Fisk (financier)|James Fisk]] took advantage of their connections with the [[Ulysses S. Grant#Gold standard and the Gold Ring|Grant Administration]] in an attempt [[Cornering the market|to corner]] the gold market. When President Grant learned of this manipulation, he ordered the Treasury to release a large supply of gold, which halted the run and caused prices to drop by eighteen percent. Fortunes were made and lost in a single day, and the president's own brother-in-law, [[Abel Corbin]], was ruined.\n\nThe earliest known use of \"Black Friday\" to refer to the day after Thanksgiving occurred in the journal, ''[[Engineering Magazine|Factory Management and Maintenance]]'', for November 1951, and again in 1952. Here it referred to the practice of workers calling in sick on the day after Thanksgiving, in order to have a four-day weekend. However, this use does not appear to have caught on. Around the same time, the terms \"Black Friday\" and \"Black Saturday\" came to be used by the police in Philadelphia and [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] to describe the crowds and traffic congestion accompanying the start of the Christmas shopping season. In 1961, the city and merchants of Philadelphia attempted to improve conditions, and a public relations expert recommended rebranding the days, \"Big Friday\" and \"Big Saturday\"; but these terms were quickly forgotten.<ref name=\"Zimmer\" /><ref name=\"linguistlist239\" /><ref name=\"snopes\">{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/holidays/thanksgiving/blackfriday.asp |title=snopes.com: How Did 'Black Friday' Get Its Name? |work= Urban Legends Reference Pages |publisher= Snopes.com |access-date=November 28, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= http://listserv.linguistlist.org/pipermail/ads-l/2014-November/135115.html |title= Around and About |work= The Shortsville-Manchester Enterprise |date= December 1, 1961 |page= 4}}</ref>\n\nUse of the phrase spread slowly, first appearing in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on November 29, 1975, in which it still refers specifically to \"the busiest shopping and traffic day of the year\" in Philadelphia. Although it soon became more widespread, ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' reported in 1985 that retailers in Cincinnati and Los Angeles were still unaware of the term.<ref name=\"listserv.linguistlist.org\">{{cite web |url= http://listserv.linguistlist.org/pipermail/ads-l/2008-April/081342.html |first= Jennifer |last= Lin |title= Why the Name Black Friday?

This was debunked by [[Snopes.com]] in 2015.<ref name=\"snopes\" />\n\n== History ==\n\nThe day after Thanksgiving as the unofficial start of the holiday shopping season may be linked together with the idea of [[Santa Claus parades]]. Parades celebrating Thanksgiving often include an appearance by Santa at the end of the parade, with the idea that \"Santa has arrived\" or \"Santa is just around the corner\" because Christmas is always the next major holiday following Thanksgiving.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many Santa or Thanksgiving Day parades were sponsored by department stores. These included the [[Toronto Santa Claus Parade]], in Canada, sponsored by [[Eaton's]], and the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]] sponsored by [[Macy's]]. Department stores would use the parades to launch a big advertising push. Eventually, it just became an unwritten rule that no store would try doing Christmas advertising before the parade was over. Therefore, the day after Thanksgiving became the day when the shopping season officially started.\n\nThanksgiving Day's relationship to Christmas shopping led to controversy in the 1930s. Retail stores would have liked to have a longer shopping season, but no store wanted to break with tradition and be the one to start advertising before Thanksgiving. For this reason, in 1939, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] issued a presidential proclamation proclaiming Thanksgiving to be the fourth Thursday in November rather than the last Thursday, meaning in some years one week earlier, in order to lengthen the Christmas shopping season.<ref name=congressthanks>{{cite web|title=Congress Establishes Thanksgiving|url=https://www.archives.gov/legislative/features/thanksgiving/|access-date=November 15, 2009}}</ref> Most people adopted the President's change, which was later reinforced by an act of Congress, but many continued to celebrate Thanksgiving Day on the traditional date.<ref name=congressthanks /> Some started referring to the new date as [[Franksgiving]].\n\nIn 2015, [[Amazon.com]] held a \"Prime Day\" event in July and promised better deals than on Black Friday, with repeat Prime Days taking place in 2016 and 2017.

In 2009, Kmart opened at 7:00&nbsp;a.m. on Thanksgiving, in order to allow shoppers to avoid Black Friday traffic and return home in time for dinner with their families. Two years later, a number of retailers began opening at 8:00 or 9:00&nbsp;p.m., on what became derisively known as \"Black Thursday\".

As the first day after the last major holiday before Christmas, it marks the unofficial beginning of the Christmas shopping season. Additionally, many employers give their employees the day off as part of the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. In order to take advantage of this, virtually all retailers in the country, big and small, offer various sales including limited amounts of doorbuster/doorcrasher/doorsmasher items to entice traffic. The early 2010s have seen retailers extend beyond normal hours in order to maintain an edge or to simply keep up with the competition. Such hours may include opening as early as 12:00&nbsp;a.m. or remaining open overnight on Thanksgiving Day and beginning sale prices at midnight. In 2010, [[Toys 'R' Us]] began their Black Friday sales at 10:00&nbsp;p.m. on Thanksgiving Day and further upped the ante by offering free boxes of [[Crayola]] crayons and coloring books for as long as supplies lasted. Other retailers, like [[Sears]], Express, MK, [[Victoria's Secret]], [[Zumiez]], [[Tillys]], [[American Eagle Outfitters]], Nike, Jordan, Puma, [[A\u00e9ropostale (clothing)|A\u00e9ropostale]], and [[Kmart]], began Black Friday sales early Thanksgiving morning and ran them through as late as 11:00&nbsp;p.m. Friday evening. [[Forever 21]] went in the opposite direction, opening at normal hours on Friday, and running late sales until 2:00&nbsp;a.m. Saturday morning.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://articles.nydailynews.com/2010-11-23/news/27082005_1_black-friday-doorbusters-thanksgiving-day-stores |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110815091655/http://articles.nydailynews.com/2010-11-23/news/27082005_1_black-friday-doorbusters-thanksgiving-day-stores |url-status= dead |archive-date= August 15, 2011 |location= New York |work= Daily News |title= Black Friday Deals for Target, H&M, Forever21, Old Navy, Radio Shack, and More |first= David |last= Yi |date= November 23, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= http://financiallyfit.yahoo.com/finance/article-111402-7507-6-post-thanksgiving-shopping-starts-earlier?ywaad=ad0035&nc |title= Black Friday Moves to Thursday as Stores Woo Shoppers |work=Yahoo!

While most injuries remain minor, serious injuries and even deliberate violence have taken place on some Black Fridays.\n\n=== 2008 ===\n\nIn 2008, a crowd of approximately 2,000 shoppers in [[Valley Stream, New York]], waited outside for the 5:00am opening of the local [[Wal-Mart]]. As opening time approached, the crowd grew anxious and when the doors were opened, the crowd pushed forward, breaking the door down, and a 34-year-old employee was trampled to death. The shoppers did not appear concerned with the victim's fate, expressing refusal to halt their stampede when other employees attempted to intervene and help the injured employee, complaining that they had been waiting in the cold and were not willing to wait any longer. Shoppers had begun assembling as early as 9:00{{nbsp}}p.m. the evening before. Even when police arrived and attempted to render aid to the injured man, shoppers continued to pour in, shoving and pushing the officers as they made their way into the store. Several other people incurred minor injuries, including a pregnant woman who had to be taken to the hospital.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news |url= http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,458744,00.html |publisher= Fox News |title= Wal-Mart Worker Dies When Shoppers Break Down Doors |date= November 28, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/11/28/2008-11-28_worker_dies_at_long_island_walmart_after.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081128175609/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/11/28/2008-11-28_worker_dies_at_long_island_walmart_after.html |archive-date= November 28, 2008 |location= New York |work= Daily News |title= Worker Dies at Long Island Wal-Mart After Being Trampled in Black Friday Stampede |first1= Joe |last1= Gould |first2= Clare |last2= Trapasso |first3= Rich |last3= Schapiro |date= November 28, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= http://edition.cnn.com/2008/US/11/28/black.friday.violence/index.html |publisher= CNN |title= Wal-Mart Worker Dies in Rush: Two Killed at Toy Store |date= November 28, 2008}}</ref> The incident may be the first case of a death occurring during Black Friday sales; according to the [[National Retail Federation]], \"We are not aware of any other circumstances where a retail employee has died working on the day after Thanksgiving.\"<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nOn the same day, two people were fatally shot during an altercation at a Toys 'R' Us in [[Palm Desert]], California.<ref name=\"LA-Times\">{{cite news |url= http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2008/11/shots-were-fire.html |work= Los Angeles Times |title= Shots Fired at Toys R Us in Palm Desert; Two Dead |date= November 28, 2008}}</ref>\n\n=== 2010 ===\n\nDuring Black Friday 2010, a [[Madison, Wisconsin]] woman was arrested outside of a [[Toys 'R' Us]] store after [[cutting in line]], and threatening to shoot other shoppers who tried to object.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://edition.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/11/26/wisconsin.shopper.threat/ |publisher= CNN |title= Black Friday Shopper Accused of Gun Threat |date= November 26, 2010}}</ref>\n\nA [[Toys for Tots]] volunteer in Georgia was stabbed by a shoplifter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cybermondayukdeals.co.uk/marine-apprehends-thief-black-friday/|title=Marine Apprehends Thief on Black Friday|first=|date=November 26, 2010|access-date=April 15, 2017|author=|work=cybermondayukdeals.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nAn [[Indianapolis]] woman was arrested after causing a disturbance by arguing with other Wal-Mart shoppers.

The text listings of items and prices are usually accompanied by pictures of the actual ad circulars. These are either leaked by insiders or intentionally released by large retailers to give consumers insight and allow them time to plan.\n\nIn recent years, some retailers (including [[Walmart]], [[Target Corporation|Target]], [[OfficeMax]], [[Big Lots]], and [[Staples, Inc.|Staples]]) have claimed that the advertisements they send in advance of Black Friday and the prices included in those advertisements are copyrighted and are [[trade secret]]s.<ref>{{cite news |title= Sale fight no fright for area Web site |work= Charleston Gazette & Daily Mail |date= November 26, 2002|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-13802620.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201040308/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-13802620.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 1, 2017|via=HighBeam Research|author=Martyn Chase}}</ref>\n\nSome of these retailers have used the [[Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act|take-down system]] of the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] as a means to remove the offending price listings. This policy may come from the fear that competitors will slash prices, and shoppers may comparison shop. The actual validity of the claim that prices form a protected work of authorship is uncertain as the prices themselves (though not the advertisements) might be considered a fact in which case they would not receive the same level of protection as a copyrighted work.<ref>''[[Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service|Feist Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service Co.]]'', 499 U.S. 340 (1991).</ref>{{original research inline|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe benefit of threatening Internet sites with a DMCA based lawsuit has proved tenuous at best. While some sites have complied with the requests, others have either ignored the threats or simply continued to post the information under the name of a similar-sounding fictional retailer. However, careful timing may mitigate the take-down notice. An [[Internet service provider]] in 2003 brought suit against [[Best Buy]], [[Kohl's]], and [[Target Corporation]], arguing that the take-down notice provisions of the DMCA are unconstitutional. The court dismissed the case, ruling that only the third-party posters of the advertisements, and not the ISP itself, would have [[standing (law)|standing]] to sue the retailers.<ref>''Fatwallet, Inc. v. Best Buy Enterprises Services'', 2004 WL 793548 (N.D.Ill. 2004).</ref>\n\nUsage of Black Friday Advertising Tip sites and buying direct varies by state in the U.S., influenced in large part by differences in shipping costs and whether a state has a sales tax. However, in recent years, the convenience of online shopping has increased the number of cross-border shoppers seeking bargains from outside of the U.S., especially from Canada. Statistics Canada indicates that online cross-border shopping by Canadians has increased by about 300M a year since 2002.<ref name=\"Statscan\">{{cite web |url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-010-x/01207/10464-eng.htm|title=Canadian Economic Observer |publisher= Stats Canada |access-date=March 18, 2010}}</ref> The complex nature of additional fees such as taxes, duties and brokerage can make calculating the final cost of cross-border Black Friday deals difficult.

Utilizing his own experiences with the fledgling US 10th Special Forces in the 50's and after travelling to Vietnam to witness US Special Forces as work in 1961 he began to work on the story. This is a highly misunderstood film about early Special Forces operations in Vietnam. It was never meant to be a portrayal of the Vietnam War as claimed by many Left wing critics. It was meant to portray the US Special Forces in Vietnam prior to the build-up of US Conventional forces in 1965.

Both ended up finishing second in the Conference races.\n\nThe Chicago Cardinals got off to their best start ever, going 4\u20130, until the Redskins beat them 17\u201314 on October 28. At the midway point, they and the Giants had 5\u20131 records. In the Western Conference, the Detroit Lions roared to a 6\u20130 start. In ''Week Seven'' (November 11), the Giants pulled ahead with a 23\u201310 win over the Cards. In Washington, the Lions finally lost. Trapped on his own 1-yard line, [[Yale Lary]] took a safety in order to get a free kick. That, and Sam Baker's field goal, gave the Redskins an 18\u201310 lead to put the game out of reach, and the Lions lost 18\u201317. The Bears, who had dropped their opener at Baltimore, 28\u201321, beat Green Bay 38\u201314 for their sixth straight game, matching Detroit's 6\u20131 record.\n\nIn ''Week Nine'', the Lions dropped their Thanksgiving Day game as [[Tobin Rote]] guided Green Bay to three last-quarter touchdowns in a 24\u201320 win.  On Sunday, the Cards 38\u201327 win over Pittsburgh put them a half game out.  The Bears cancelled a loss, while the Giants watched a win elude them, as Harlon Hill caught a last-ditch 56-yard touchdown pass from Ed Brown in tying the Giants, 17\u201317.  Both the Bears and the Giants continued to lead their conferences, but only by half a game.<ref>\"Bears Tie New York, 17\u201317\", ''Albuquerque Journal'', Nov 26, 1956, p12</ref>\n\nThe Cards lost the next two games and any chance at the Eastern title, which the Giants clinched, in part because of a 28\u201314 win over Washington on December 2.  The Western race came down to the Bears and Lions. In ''Week Ten'' (December 2), the Lions hosted the Bears and won 42\u201310, to take the lead. When both teams won the following week, the trip to the championship came down to December 16, the last game of the season, which would have the 9\u20132 Detroit Lions visiting the 8\u20132\u20131 Chicago Bears, who hadn't forgotten the earlier drubbing. The game at Wrigley Field was marked by numerous fights, including a fourth quarter melee involving players, fans, and the police,<ref>\"Casares Leads Bears Past Lions For Western Title, 38\u201321\", ''Albuquerque Journal'' (December 17, 1956), p16</ref> and a vicious hit well behind the play by the Bears' [[Ed Meadows]] that knocked Detroit quarterback [[Bobby Layne]] out of the game with a concussion.  So, the Bears exacted their revenge with a 38\u201321 victory. After the game Lions' coach [[Buddy Parker]] appealed to the commissioner to punish what the Lions felt was the dirty play of [[George Halas]]'s Bears, but no ruling was forthcoming.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
