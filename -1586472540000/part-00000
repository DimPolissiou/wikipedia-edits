As the policy evolved from \"Initiation in the 1960s\u20131970s; Maturity in the 1980s\u20131990s; and Legalization in the 2000s\u20132010s\",<ref name=\"Princeton Population\" /> the administration of the population policy also changed. From 1961-1983, the population program fell under the Population and Birth Control Unit. From 1984\u20132002, it was under the control of National Committee for Population and Family Planning. From 2003\u20132006, it was in the jurisdiction of the Vietnam Commission for Population, Family and Children. Since 2007, the population program has been under the General Office for Population and Family Planning.<ref name=\"Princeton Population\" />\n\nAlthough the policy was advocated on the national level, the central government did not utilize specific fines or incentives, instead delegating implementation responsibilities to local governments.<ref name=\"Reproductive Rights Overview\"/> Each family was required to have at most two children, and local governments were responsible to decide the details of enforcement. Depending on the specific location, district governments charged fines ranging from 60 to 800 kilograms of paddy rice, equivalent to the worth of a month to a year's wages, for each additional child, and additionally, women who agreed to be sterilized were given bonuses of 120 to 400 kilograms of rice. Individuals who did not use contraceptives sometimes had their names announced over the intercom system of the village to shame them into using them, whereas individuals who did could be selected to win the Labor Medal for \"good realization of the population \u2013 family planning program\".<ref name=\"Reproductive Rights Overview\" /> The government and large companies also regularly denied people who violated the policy of their salaries, promotions, and sometimes even their jobs.<ref name=\"Reproductive Rights Overview\" />\n\n===Current status===\n\nCurrently, the effective population policy is the revised 2009 Population Ordinance which states that \"each couple and individual has the right and responsibility to participate in the campaigns on population and family planning, reproductive health care: (i) decide time and birth spacing; (ii) have one or two children, exceptional cases to be determined by the Government.\"<ref name=\"Population Ordinance 2008 Amend\" /> Thus, individuals have control over the timing and spacing of the births of their children but are still restricted in the number of children they are allowed to have. Furthermore, later that year, Chief Executive Tr\u01b0\u01a1ng T\u1ea5n San stressed the need for continued diligence in population control and stated that the population of Vietnam should be 100 million people by 2020, and suggested that a new comprehensive Law on Population be introduced to the government by 2015.<ref name=\"Princeton Population\" />\n\n===Effects of this policy===\n\n====Reduction of the birthrate====\nThe total fertility rate in Vietnam dropped from 5.6 in 1979 to 3.2 by 1993, suggesting the two-child policy was successful in containing the population growth.<ref name=\"Falling Fertility\">{{cite journal|last1=Haughton|first1=Jonathan|title=Falling Fertility in Vietnam|journal=Population Studies: A Journal of Demography|date=1997|volume=51|issue=2|pages=203\u2013211|doi=10.1080/0032472031000149916}}</ref> According to one demographic model, the [[fertility#Bongaarts' model of components of fertility|Bongaarts' model of components of fertility]], high rates of contraceptive use and of induced abortion are plausible explanations for the decreased fertility rate.

During the [[Battle of Midway]], while leading his air group's scout bombers on June 4, 1942, he made the critical tactical decision that led to the sinking of two of Japan's [[aircraft carrier|fleet carrier]]s, ''{{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Kaga||2}}'' and ''{{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Akagi||2}}''. \n\nWhen McClusky could not find the Japanese carriers where he expected them, and with his air group's fuel running dangerously low, he began a box search and on the second leg spotted the {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Arashi||2|up=y}} steaming north at flank speed. The ''Arashi'' had stayed behind to attack the submarine ''{{USS|Nautilus|SS-168|6}}'', which had been harassing the Japanese fleet. Surmising that the ''Arashi'' must be following the main fleet, McClusky ordered a change in course in the same direction as ''Arashi''. This led him directly to the enemy carriers. \n\nMcClusky gave an order to attack, which resulted in confusion with both squadrons of 31 aircraft diving on the closer carrier, ''Kaga''. Doctrine called for McClusky's forward squadron to attack the further carrier, ''Akagi'', and squadron behind his to attack ''Kaga''. Thus the two carrier attacks would occur at the same time and make it harder for Japanese [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero|Zeros]] to respond. \n\nLieutenant [[Richard Halsey Best|Richard Best]], who commanded the other squadron and was considered to be its best pilot, noticed the error and pulled out with two wingmen to attack the ''Akagi'', with Best scoring a direct hit amidship and a wingman a near miss at the rear of the ship, which disabled the rudder and rendered the ''Akagi'' immobile. \n\nThe other 28 dive bombers, some of which nearly collided with each other, scored at least four hits on ''Kaga'', leaving it a burning wreck. \n\nAs he pulled out of his dive, McClusky's plane was pounced on by two Zeros, which put 52 holes in his plane and a bullet through his shoulder. After his gunner shot down one of the Zeros, McClusky was able to land his plane safely on the ''Enterprise'' even with partially shot up controls. \n\nThe confused attack order was later explained as a radio error due to [[interference (communication)|multiple people speaking at the same time]]. As a fighter pilot new to the dive bombing squadron, McClusky was not familiar with dive bombing doctrine, as was Best. This explains McClusky's decision to lead his squadron in attacking the closer ''Kaga''. \n\nMeanwhile, a squadron from the ''Yorktown'', led by Max Leslie, had taken off an hour later, but it used a more recent, and hence more accurate, sighting for the location of the Japanese carriers. It arrived at the same moment as the ''Enterprise''{{'}}s bombers and attacked the ''{{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Soryu||2}}''. \n\nWithin minutes, three of the four Japanese carriers had been turned into burning hulks. The actual sinking of all four carriers was done by torpedoes from Japanese escort ships as the Japanese were unable to move their crippled carriers and did not want them to be captured. \n\nMcClusky, for his vital contribution to the outcome of this pivotal battle, was awarded the [[Navy Cross]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Michel |first=Lou|date=May 29, 2016 |title=South Buffalo pilot\u2019s mettle turned the tide in Battle of Midway|url= http://buffalonews.com/2016/05/29/south-buffalo-pilots-mettle-turned-the-tide-in-battle-of-midway/ |work=[[The Buffalo News]] |access-date=May 13, 2017}}</ref> Later in World War II, he commanded the [[escort aircraft carrier|escort carrier]] {{USS|Corregidor|CVE-58|6}}.\n\n==After the war==\nMcClusky served in a variety of staff and shore positions in the later 1940s.

Some of the themes include warnings about the futility of involvement with the things of the corporeal world, the correspondence between microcosm and macrocosm, and self-knowledge as the goal of human existence.

His major concern is to explain the salvific power of true knowledge, i.e., self-knowledge, or knowledge of the Self (\u1e0f\u0101t or howw\u012byat, God Himself viewed as the center of man\u2019s being).<ref name=\"Iranica\"/>  His philosophy is an autology ({{lang-fa|\u062e\u0648\u062f\u0634\u0646\u0627\u0633\u06cc}})(Persian: \u1e35hod-\u0161en\u0101s\u012b).  That is: \"To know oneself is to know the everlasting reality that is consciousness, and to know it is to be it.\".<ref name=\"Iranica\"/>  His ontology is interconnected simultaneously with his [[epistemology]], because according to him, full actualization of the potentialities of the universe can only take place through the self-awareness of human beings.  This ontology can only be realized by the training of the human soul, or education in the widest sense of the term.  \n\nHis view of the structure of the reality is succinctly explained in the beginning of his work Rahanj\u0101m-n\u0101ma.\n\n==Sample Poetry==\nA quatrain:\n''Suppose you run the world as you like, then what?''\n<br/>\n''You read life's book to the end, then what?''\n<br/>\n''You have your way for hundred years---''\n<br/>\n''then a hundred more, then What?''\n\n==References and notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*The Heart of Islamic Philosophy: The Quest for Self-Knowledge in the Teachings of Afdal al-Din Kashani.
