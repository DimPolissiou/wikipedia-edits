The US military (in which he was never inducted) charged him with desertion and spreading propaganda, then sentenced him to death (this was later revised to 25 years hard labor).<ref>{{Cite journal| author = Staff of the Catholic Peace Fellowship| year= 2007| title=The Life and Witness of Ben Salmon| journal = Sign of Peace | volume = 6.1| issue = Spring 2007| pages =| id =| url =http://www.catholicpeacefellowship.org/nextpage.asp?m=2524}}</ref> On June 5, 1917, Salmon wrote in a letter to President Wilson:\n\n{{cquote|Regardless of nationality, all men are brothers. God is \"our Father who art in heaven\". The commandment \"Thou shalt not kill\" is unconditional and inexorable. ... The lowly Nazarene taught us the doctrine of non-resistance, and so convinced was he of the soundness of that doctrine that he sealed his belief with death on the cross. When human law conflicts with Divine law, my duty is clear. Conscience, my infallible guide, impels me to tell you that prison, death, or both, are infinitely preferable to joining any branch of the Army.<ref>{{cite book|title=Unsung Hero of the Great War: The Life and Witness of Ben Salmon|year=1989|author=Torin Finney|pages= 118\u2013119}}</ref>}}\n\nBecause of their conscientious objection to participation in military service, whether armed or unarmed, Jehovah's Witnesses have often faced imprisonment or other penalties. In [[Greece]], for example, before the introduction of alternative civilian service in 1997, hundreds of Witnesses were imprisoned, some for three years or even more for their refusal. In [[Armenia]], young Jehovah's Witnesses were imprisoned because of their conscientious objection to military service; this was discontinued in November 2013.<ref>[http://www.jw.org/en/news/by-region/europe/armenia/armenia-releases-imprisoned-jehovahs-witnesses/ Armenia Releases All Imprisoned Jehovah's Witnesses].</ref> The government of South Korea also imprisons hundreds for refusing the draft. In [[Switzerland]], virtually every Jehovah's Witness is exempted from military service. The [[Finland|Finnish]] government exempts Jehovah's Witnesses from the draft completely.\n\nFor believers in [[Indian religions]], the opposition to warfare may be based on either the general idea of [[ahimsa]], [[nonviolence]], or on an explicit prohibition of violence by their religion, e.g., for a [[Buddhist]], one of the [[five precepts]] is \"P\u0101n\u0101tip\u0101t\u0101 verama\u1e47i sikkh\u0101padam sam\u0101diy\u0101mi\", or \"I undertake the precept to refrain from destroying living creatures\", which is in obvious opposition to the practice of warfare. The [[14th Dalai Lama]] has stated that war \"should be relegated to the dustbin of history\". On the other hand, many Buddhist sects, especially in Japan, have been thoroughly militarized, warrior monks (''yamabushi'' or ''[[s\u014dhei]]'') participating in the civil wars. Hindu beliefs do not go against the concept of war, as seen in the [[Gita]]. Both Sikhs and Hindus believe war should be a last resort and should be fought to sustain life and morality in society.\n\n[[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith|Bah\u00e1'\u00eds]] are advised to do social service instead of active army service, but when this is not possible because of obligations in certain countries, the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed laws|Bah\u00e1'\u00ed law]] of ''loyalty to one's government'' is preferred and the individual should perform the army service.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://bahai-library.com/mazal_comparison_christianity_bahai&chapter=1 | title = Selected Topics of Comparison in Christianity and the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith | accessdate = 13 September 2006 | first = Peter |last = Mazal | date = 21 October 2003}}</ref><ref name=\"ud1\">{{Cite book|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/UD/ud-136.html | first = Shoghi | last = Effendi |authorlink = Shoghi Effendi|title = Unfolding Destiny|pages = 134\u2013135}}</ref>\n\nSome practitioners of [[paganism|pagan religions]], particularly [[Wicca]], may object on the grounds of the [[Wiccan rede]], which states \"An it harm none, do what ye will\" (or variations). The [[threefold law]] may also be grounds for objection.\n\nA notable example of a conscientious objector was the [[Austrians|Austrian]] devout [[Roman Catholic]] Christian [[Franz J\u00e4gerst\u00e4tter]], who was executed on August 9, 1943 for openly refusing to serve in the Nazi [[Wehrmacht]], consciously accepting the penalty of death. He was [[Beatification|declared Blessed]] by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in 2007 for dying for his beliefs, and is viewed as a symbol of self-sacrificing resistance.\n\n==Alternatives for objectors==\nSome conscientious objectors are unwilling to serve the military in any capacity, while others accept noncombatant roles. While conscientious objection is usually the refusal to collaborate with military organizations, as a combatant in war or in any supportive role, some advocate compromising forms of conscientious objection. One compromising form is to accept [[non-combatant]] roles during conscription or [[military service]]. Alternatives to military or civilian service include serving an imprisonment or other punishment for refusing conscription, falsely claiming unfitness for duty by feigning an allergy or a heart condition, delaying conscription until the maximum drafting age, or seeking refuge in a country which does not extradite those wanted for military conscription. Avoiding military service is sometimes labeled [[draft dodger|draft dodging]], particularly if the goal is accomplished through dishonesty or evasive maneuvers. However, many people who support conscription will distinguish between \"[[bona fide]]\" ''conscientious objection'' and ''draft dodging'', which they view as evasion of military service without a valid excuse.\n\nConservative Mennonites do not object to serving their country in peaceful alternatives ([[alternative service]]) such as hospital work, farming, forestry, road construction and similar occupations. Their objection is in being part in any military capacity whether noncombatant or regular service. During World War II and the Korean, Vietnam war eras they served in many such capacities in alternative I-W service programs initially through the Mennonite Central Committee and now through their own alternatives.\n\nDespite the fact that international institutions such as the United Nations (UN) and the [[Council of Europe]] (CoE) regard and promote conscientious objection as a human right,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www1.law.nyu.edu/journals/jilp/issues/33/pdf/33n.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122030613/http://www1.law.nyu.edu/journals/jilp/issues/33/pdf/33n.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=22 November 2011 |title=THE STATUS OF CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTION UNDER ARTICLE 4 OF THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS, 33 N.Y.U.

In many countries outside Europe, especially in armed conflict areas (e.g. [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]), conscientious objection is punished severely.\n\nWhile conscientious objectors used to be seen as deserters, traitors, cowards, slackers or simply un-patriotic, their image has changed drastically in the Western world in past decades.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Especially in Europe, where objectors usually serve an alternative civilian service, they are regarded as making an equally important contribution to society as conscripts.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Parallel to that, the number of objectors has risen significantly.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}. In 1991, The Peace Abbey established the National Registry for Conscientious Objection where people can publicly state their refusal to participate in armed conflict.\n\n==Conscientious objection around the world==\n===Belgium===\nConscription was mandatory to all able-bodied [[Belgium|Belgian]] males until 1994, when it was suspended. Civilian service was possible since 1963. Objectors could apply for the status of conscience objector. When granted, they did an alternative service with the civil service or with a socio-cultural organisation. The former would last 1.5 times as long as the shortest military service, the latter twice as long.\n\nAfter their service, objectors are not allowed to take jobs that require them to carry weapons, such as police jobs, until the age of 42.\n\nSince conscription was suspended in 1994 and military service is voluntary, the status of conscience objector can not be granted anymore in Belgium.\n\n===Canada===\n{{see also|Canada and Iraq War resisters|War Resisters Support Campaign}}\n\nMennonites and other similar peace churches in Canada were automatically exempt from any type of service during [[Military history of Canada during World War I|Canada's involvement in World War I]] by provisions of the [[Order in Council]] of 1873 yet initially, many were imprisoned until the matter was again resettled. With pressure of public opinion, the Canadian government barred entry of additional [[Mennonite]] and [[Hutterite]] immigrants, rescinding the privileges of the Order in Council.<ref>Smith, p. 321. The [[Conscription Crisis of 1917]] also barred immigrants and objectors from voting.\n\nThis bar on entry was overturned in the 1920s, allowing immigrants to escape Soviet repression.</ref> During [[Military history of Canada during the Second World War|Canada's involvement in World War II]], Canadian conscientious objectors were given the options of noncombatant military service, serving in the medical or dental corps under military control or working in parks and on roads under civilian supervision.

During the [[Finnish Civil War]] in 1918, conscription was reintroduced for all able-bodied men. In 1922, the option of noncombatant military service was introduced, but service in the military remained compulsory on pain of imprisonment. After the struggle of pacifist [[Arndt Pekurinen]] a law was passed providing for a peacetime-only alternative to military service, or civilian service (Finnish ''siviilipalvelus''). The law was dubbed \"Lex Pekurinen\" after him. During the [[Winter War]], Pekurinen and other conscientious objectors were imprisoned, and Pekurinen was eventually executed at the front in 1941, during the [[Continuation War]].\n\nAfter the war, a conscientious objector's civilian service lasted 16 months, whereas military service was 8 months at its shortest. To qualify for civilian service, an objector had to explain his conviction before a board of inspection that included military officers and clergymen. In 1987, the duration of the service was shortened to 13 months and the board of inspection was abolished. In 2008, the term was further shortened to 12 months to match the duration of the longest military service (that of officer trainees and technical crew). Today, a person subject to conscription may apply for civilian service at any time before or during his military service, and the application is accepted as a matter of course. A female performing voluntary military service can quit her service anytime during the first 45 days, however, if she wants to quit after those 45 days she would be treated like a male and assigned to civilian service.\n\nPersons who have completed their civilian service during peacetime have, according to the legislation enacted in 2008, the right to serve in non-military duties also during a crisis situation. They may be called to serve in various duties with the rescue services or other necessary work of a non-military nature. Persons who declare themselves to be conscientious objectors only after a crisis has started must, however, prove their conviction before a special board. Before the new legislation, the right to conscientious objection was acknowledged only in peacetime. The changes to the service term and to the legal status of objectors during a crisis situation were made as a response to human rights concerns voiced by several international bodies,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aseistakieltaytyjaliitto.fi/ihmisoikeuselimet.html|title=Suomi syrjii aseistakielt\u00e4ytyji\u00e4! - AKL|website=aseistakieltaytyjaliitto.fi|accessdate=12 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070726143012/http://www.aseistakieltaytyjaliitto.fi/ihmisoikeuselimet.html|archive-date=26 July 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/CCPR.CO.82.FIN.En?Opendocument|title=unhchr.ch|website=unhchr.ch|accessdate=12 August 2017}}</ref> who are overseeing the implementation of human rights agreements. These organisations had demanded Finland to take measures to improve its legislation concerning conscientious objectors, which they considered discriminatory. None of these organisations have yet raised concerns on the current legislation.\n\nThere are a small number of total objectors who refuse even civilian service, and are imprisoned for six months. This is not registered into the person's criminal record.\n<!---Text from [[Conscientious objection throughout the world]] - needs merging into existing text -\nFor many decades, the civilian service remained unpopular and difficult to choose. Refusing military service would have been very strongly discouraged by all state officials, and getting accepted as a conscientious objector required a trial by an examination board, whose judgement was often very harsh and strongly biased towards military service. These boards included army officers and clergy. A typical hypothetical presented to the examinee was \"If a group of men threatened to beat your girlfriend up, would you try to stop them?\".\n\nThe examinations were abolished in the 1980s, and today a conscientious objector is only required to check a box in the draft form and state whether his reasons are religious or ethical. Severe social stigma attachs to conscientious objection, and the military, which is responsible for the draft, does not advertise the option beyond their legal obligation to mention the option to draftees.\n\nThe civilian service of conscientious objectors lasts 395 days, over twice as long as the shortest and most common military service (180 days) and thirty days longer than the longest and mostly voluntary service (365 days).\n\nThe first four weeks of the civilian service are spent in training, which mostly consists of general-purpose lectures on various topics. The first three weeks of the training are held at the [[Lapinj\u00e4rvi Educational Center]], and the fourth week is a free vacation.\n\nIn Finland today, the right to conscientious objection is still acknowledged only in peacetime. In recent years several international bodies<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aseistakieltaytyjaliitto.fi/ihmisoikeuselimet.html|title=Suomi syrjii aseistakielt\u00e4ytyji\u00e4! - AKL|website=aseistakieltaytyjaliitto.fi|accessdate=12 August 2017}}</ref> (for example UN's Human Rights Committee<ref name=\"unhchr.ch\">{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/CCPR.CO.82.FIN.En?Opendocument|title=unhchr.ch|website=unhchr.ch|accessdate=12 August 2017}}</ref>), who are overseeing the implementation of human rights agreements, have demanded Finland to take measures to improve its legislation concerning COs, since they have found it to be discriminatory. Sources of criticism have been the punitive length of the civilian alternative to military service, the release of conscientious objectors from military duty only during peace time and the negligence in arranging accommodation for the servicemen{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}. Since 1999, [[Amnesty International]]<ref name=\"amnesty.org\">https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur20/001/1999/en/</ref> has considered Finnish ''total objectors'', who have refused to carry out non-military service, as prisoners of conscience, because of the punitive length of civilian service.\n\nThe main 12-month period of service can be performed in any institution that is both non-profit and beneficial to the society. Examples include state bureaus, schools, universities, hospitals, libraries, theatres and independent non-profit organisations such as [[Amnesty International]]. Institutions wishing to accept conscientious objectors must comply with rules laid down by the Finnish Ministry of Labour.\n\nFrom the state's point of view, conscientious objectors are subject to the same rights and obligations as military enlisted men. How the service is handled in practice depends on the place of service, but a typical service consists of a common 40-hour week in the institution.\n\nSome 2,500 men opt for the civilian service every year, which is ca. 10% of the men drafted.\n\nMen who refuse both the military and the civilian services are known as total objectors (Finnish ''totaalikielt\u00e4ytyj\u00e4''). Total objectors are sentenced unconditionally to a prison term equal to half their remaining service. In 2002, some 80 men were convicted as total objectors. It is usual for total objectors to cite in their defence the Finnish Constitution, several international human rights bodies (for example UN's Human Rights Committee<ref name=\"unhchr.ch\"/>), and the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which bans forced labour except in emergencies and wartime, as well as the arguably discriminatory and unconstitutional exemption from military service granted to women, men living in demilitarised \u00c5land and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]].\n\nSince 1999, [[Amnesty International]]<ref name=\"amnesty.org\"/> have considered the excessive length, as compared to military service, of the civilian service to be punitive and accordingly classifies Finnish total objectors as [prisoners of conscience]. In one recent case (namely ''Case-Hermaja''<ref>http://www.hermaja.org/</ref>), a total objector Jussi Hermaja has sought asylum from another country, Belgium. While asylum was eventually not granted, he was not extradited because the state of Finland never filed a formal request.\n\nSince some 80% of Finnish men undergo military service and since military training and rank are considered merits at the job market, conscientious objectors experience discrimination. A reserve officer's or NCO's rank is considered a more significant merit for management positions than university degrees or work experience (see [[management by perkele]]). However, in most cases employers legally have no defensible reason to favour or even ask about a candidate's military training.--->\n\n===France===\n[[File:Objecteurs.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Stamp created by the ''Centre de d\u00e9fense des objecteurs de conscience'' (around 1936).]]\nThe creation of a legal status for conscientious objectors in France was the subject of a long struggle involving for instance or the much-publicised trials of Protestant activists [[Jacques Martin (pacifist)|Jacques Martin]], Philippe Vernier and Camille Rombault in 1932\u20131933<ref name = JPC>Jean-Paul Cahn, Fran\u00e7oise Knopper, Anne-Marie Saint-Gille, De la Guerre juste \u00e0 la paix juste: Aspects confessionnels de la construction de la paix dans l'espace franco-allemand (XVIe-XXe si\u00e8cle), Collection Histoire et civilisations, Presses Universitaires Septentrion, 2008, 313 pages, {{ISBN|9782757400388}}, p.168</ref> or the hunger strike of [[anarchist]] [[Louis Lecoin]] in 1962.\n\nThe legal status law was passed in December 1963, 43 years (and many prison sentences) after the first requests.\n\nIn 1983, a new law passed by socialist Interior Minister [[Pierre Joxe]] considerably improved this status, simplifying the conditions under which the status would be granted. Conscientious objectors were then free to choose an activity in the social realm where they would spend their civil service time. However, in order to avoid too many applications for civil service at the expense of the military, the duration of the civil service is however kept twice as long as the military service.\n\nThe effect of these laws was suspended in 2001 when compulsory military service was abolished in France. The special prison at Strasbourg for Jehovah's Witnesses, who refuse to join any military, was also abolished.\n\nSince 1986, the associations defending conscientious objection in France have chosen to celebrate their cause on 15 May.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wri-irg.org/fr/node/1394|title=15 mai \u2013 Journ\u00e9e internationale de l'objection de conscience - Internationale des R\u00e9sistant(e)s \u00e0 la Guerre|website=wri-irg.org|accessdate=12 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815132422/http://www.wri-irg.org/fr/node/1394|archive-date=15 August 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Germany===\n{{Main|Conscription in Germany}}\n\n====Nazi Germany====\nIn [[Nazi Germany]], conscientious objection was not recognized in the law. In theory, objectors would be drafted and then court-martialled for desertion. The practice was even harsher: going beyond the letter of an already extremely flexible law, conscientious objection was considered [[Wehrkraftzersetzung|subversion of military strength]], a crime normally punished with death. On September 15, 1939 August Dickmann, a Jehovah's Witness, and the first conscientious objector of the war to be executed, died by a firing squad at the [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]].<ref>September 17, 1939 ''The New York Times'' See also: ''A Teacher's Guide to the Holocaust'' by Florida Center for Instructional Technology [http://fcit.usf.edu/holocaust/people/JWTIMELN.HTM]</ref> Among others, [[Franz J\u00e4gerst\u00e4tter]] was executed after his conscientious objection, on the grounds that he could not fight in the forces of the evil side.\n\n====East Germany====\n{{Main|Conscientious objection in East Germany}}\nAfter World War II in [[East Germany]], there was no official right to conscientious objection. Nevertheless, and uniquely among the Eastern bloc, objections were accepted and the objectors assigned to construction units. They were however part of the military, so that a fully civilian alternative did not exist. Also, \"[[construction soldier]]s\" were discriminated against in their later professional life.<ref>[[Bernd Eisenfeld]]: Das Verh\u00e4ltnis der Partei- und Staatsf\u00fchrung der DDR zu den Bausoldaten a) die agitatorische Diskriminierung der Bausoldaten b) die substantielle Diskriminierung der Bausoldaten. pp. 115\u2013125. in: Kriegsdienstverweigerung in der DDR&nbsp;\u2013 ein Friedensdienst?

''In German''</ref>\n\n====West Germany and reunified Germany====\nAccording to Article 4(3) of the [[Grundgesetz|German constitution]]: \"No person may be forced against their conscience to perform armed military service. Details shall be regulated by a federal law.\"\n\nAccording to Article 12a, a law may be passed to require every male from the age of 18 to military service called ''Wehrdienst''; also, a law can require conscientious objectors to perform non-military service instead called ''Wehrersatzdienst'', literally \"military replacement service\", or colloquially ''[[Zivildienst]]''. These laws were applicable and demanded compulsory service in the German [[Bundeswehr|armed forces]] (German: ''Bundeswehr'') until the abolition of draft in 2011. Initially, each conscientious objectors had to appear in person to a panel hearing at the draft office (or contest a negative decision at the [[administrative court]]). The suspension of the procedure (1977), allowing to \"object with a post card\", was ruled unconstitutional in 1978. Beginning in 1983, competence was shifted to the ''Kreiswehrersatzamt'' (military replacement office), which had discretion to either approve or reject a conscientious objection, which had to consist of a detailed written statement by an applicant giving reasons as to why the applicant was conscientiously objecting. This was generally just a formality, and objections were not often rejected. In later years in particular however, with the rise of the Internet, conscientious objections fell into disrepute because of the ease of being able to simply download existing example objections. It earned some conscientious objections the suspicion of an applicant simply attempting an easy way out of military service. On the other hand, certain organizations within the German peace movement had been offering pamphlets for decades giving suggestions to applicants as to the proper wording and structure of an objection which would have the greatest chances of success.\n\nFollowing a 1985 Federal Constitution Court decision, Wehrersatzdienst could be no simple choice of convenience for an applicant, but he had to cite veritable conflict of conscience which made him unable to perform any kind of military service at all. If there was doubt about the true nature of an objector's application, he could be summoned to appear before a panel at the Kreiswehrersatzamt to explain his reasons in person. An approved conscientious objection in any case then meant that an applicant was required by law to perform Wehrersatzdienst. Complete objection both to military and replacement service was known as ''Totalverweigerung''; it was illegal and could be punished with a fine or a suspended custodial sentence.\n\nNearly the only legal way to get both out of military service and replacement service was to be deemed physically unfit for military service. Both men who entered military service and those who wanted to go into replacement service had to pass a military physical examination at the military replacement office. Five categories/levels of physical fitness, or ''Tauglichkeitsstufen'', existed. ''Tauglichkeitsstufe 5'', in short ''T5'', meant that a person was rejected for military service and thus also did not need to enter replacement service. ''T5'' status was usually only granted if a person had physical or mental disabilities or was otherwise significantly impaired, such as due to very poor eyesight or debilitating chronic illnesses.\n\nAnother way to get out of service completely was the ''two brothers rule'', which stated that if two older brothers had already served in the military, any following male children of a family were exempt from service.\n\nDue to [[West Berlin]]'s special status between the end of the Second World War and 1990 as a city governed by foreign military powers, draft did not apply within its borders. This made Berlin a safe haven for many young people who chose to move to the city to prevent criminal court repercussions for ''Totalverweigerung''. As ''Totalverweigerer'' were often part of the far-left political spectrum, this was one factor which spawned a politically active left-wing and left-wing radical scene in the city.\n\nWehrersatzdienst was for a long time considerably longer than military service, by up to a third, even when the duration of service was gradually reduced following reunification and the end of the Cold War. This was held by some as a violation of constitutional principles, but was upheld in several court decisions based on the reasoning that former service personnel could be redrafted for military exercises called ''Wehr\u00fcbungen'', while somebody who had served out his replacement service could not. Moreover, work conditions under military service typically involved more hardship and inconvenience than Wehrersatzdienst. In 2004, military service and Wehrersatzdienst were then made to last equal lengths of time.\n\nMilitary service and draft were controversial during much of their existence. Reasons included the consideration that Germans could be made to fight against their fellow Germans in East Germany. Moreover, draft only applied to men, which was seen as gender based discrimination by some, but was often countered by the argument that women usually gave up their careers either temporarily or permanently to raise their children. With the end of the Cold War and the German military's primary purpose of defending its home territory increasingly looking doubtful, draft also began to become more arbitrary, as only certain portions of a particular birth year were drafted (usually those in very healthy physical condition), while others weren't. This was seen as a problem of ''Wehrgerechtigkeit'', or equal justice of military service.\n\nThen-German President [[Roman Herzog]] said in a 1994 speech (which was frequently cited as an argument for draft abolition) that only the necessity for national defense, not any other arguments can justify draft. On the other hand, this logic tended to not be extended to men serving Wehrersatzdienst, as they usually worked in fields of public health, [[elderly care]], medical assistance or assistance for the disabled. Their relatively low-paid work was seen as an ever more important backbone of a health sector which was grappling with rapidly increasing costs of care.\n\nIn 2011 the mandatory draft was abolished in Germany, mainly due to a perceived lack of aforementioned necessity. The ''Bundeswehr'' now solely relies on service members who deliberately choose it as a career path. Neither Article 12a (establishing the possibility of draft) nor Article 4 (3) (permitting conscientious objection) have been removed from the German Constitution. In theory, this makes a full reversion to draft (and Wehrersatzdienst) possible, if it is thought to be necessary.\n\n===Israel===\n{{main|Refusal to serve in the IDF}}\nAll Israeli citizens and permanent residents are liable to military service. However, the Ministry of Defense has used its discretion under article 36 of this law to automatically exempt all non-Jewish women and all Arab men, except for the Druze, from military service ever since Israel was established. Israeli Arabs may volunteer to perform military service, but very few do so (except among the Bedouin population of Israel).<ref name=\"wri-irg.org\">{{cite web|url=http://wri-irg.org/co/co-isr-03.htm|title=Conscientious objection to military service in Israel: an unrecognised human right - War Resisters' International|website=wri-irg.org|accessdate=12 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121141156/http://wri-irg.org/co/co-isr-03.htm|archive-date=21 January 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn discussing the status of the armed forces shortly after the founding of the State of Israel, representatives of orthodox religious parties argued that yeshiva students should be exempt from military service. This derives from the Jewish tradition that if a man wants to dedicate his life to religious study, society must allow him to do so. The request of orthodox political parties to 'prevent neglect of studying the Torah' was granted by the authorities. But in recent years this exemption practice has become the subject of debate in Israeli society, as the absolute and the relative numbers of the men who received this exemption rose sharply.<ref>From the [[Torato Omanuto]] entry: \"from 800 men in 1968 to 41,450 in 2005 compared to 7 million for the entire population of Israel.

Those who were born in the last months of the year typically used to serve in the Navy, unless judged unable for ship service (in this case they could be sent back to Army or Air Force). Until 1972, objectors were considered as [[Treason|traitors]] and tried by a military tribunal; after 1972, objectors could choose an alternative civilian service, which was eight months longer than standard military service (fifteen months, then twelve, as for Army and Air Force, 24 months, then eighteen, then twelve as for the Navy){{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}. Since such length was judged too punitive, an arrangement was made to make the civilian service as long as the military service.

However, 6,000 were refused any exemption and forced into main army regiments; if they then refused to obey orders, they were [[Court-martial#United Kingdom|court-martialled]] and sent to prison. Thus, the well-known pacifist and religious writer [[Stephen Henry Hobhouse]] was called up in 1916: he and many other Quaker activists took the unconditionalist stand, refusing both military and alternative service, and on enforced enlistment were court-martialled and imprisoned for disobedience.<ref>Brock, Peter,''These strange criminals: an anthology of prison memoirs by conscientious objectors to military service from the Great War to the Cold War'', p. 14, Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0802087078}}</ref> Conscientious objectors formed only a tiny proportion of Military Service Tribunals' cases over the whole conscription period, estimated at around 2%.<ref>Adrian Gregory, 'Military Service Tribunals, 1916\u20131918' in J.

Conscientious objectors who were deemed not to have made any useful contribution to the state were formally [[Disfranchisement|disfranchised]] (through a clause inserted in the [[Representation of the People Act 1918]] at the insistence of back-bench MPs) for the five years 1 September 1921 - 31 August 1926, but as it was a last-minute amendment there was no administrative machinery to enforce such disfranchisement, which was admitted to be a \"dead letter\".<ref>[[A. J. P. Taylor]], ''English History, 1914\u20131945'' (Oxford University Press, 1990), p. 116; [http://www.spartacus-educational.com/FWWpacifists.htm FWW Pacifists] at spartacus-educational.com</ref>\n\nBritain's conscription legislation of 1916 did not apply to [[Ireland]], despite it being then all part of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. However, in 1918 the Army's continuing demand for more troops led to passing a further act enabling conscription in Ireland if and when the government saw fit. In the event, the government never saw fit, although the legislation led to the [[Conscription Crisis of 1918]]. Similarly, British conscription in the [[Second World War]] did not apply to [[Northern Ireland]]. Nevertheless, many [[Irishmen]] volunteered to fight in both world wars. The various parts of the [[British Empire]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] had their own laws: in general, all the larger countries of the Empire participated, and some were, in proportion to their population, major participants in the First World War.\n\nIn the Second World War, following the [[National Service (Armed Forces) Act 1939]], there were nearly 60,000 registered Conscientious Objectors. Testing by tribunals resumed, this time by special Conscientious Objection Tribunals chaired by a judge, and the effects were much less harsh. If you were not a member of the Quakers or some similar pacifist organisation, it was generally enough to say that you objected to \"warfare as a means of settling international disputes\", a phrase from the [[Kellogg-Briand Pact]] of 1928. The tribunals could grant full exemption, exemption conditional on alternative service, exemption only from combatant duties, or dismiss the application. Of the 61,000 who were registered, 3,000 were given complete exemption; 18,000 applications were initially dismissed, but a number of such applicants succeeded at the Appellate Tribunal, sometimes after a \"qualifying\" sentence of three-months' imprisonment for an offence deemed to have been committed on grounds of conscience. Of those directed to non-combatant military service almost 7,000 were allocated to the Non-Combatant Corps, re-activated in mid-1940; its companies worked in clothing and food stores, in transport, or any military project not requiring the handling of \"material of an aggressive nature\". In November 1940 it was decided to allow troops in the NCC to volunteer for work in [[bomb disposal]].<ref name=UXB92 /> In total over 350 volunteered.<ref name=UXB92>{{cite book |title= Danger UXB The Remarkable Story of the Disposal of Unexploded Bombs During the Second World War |last=Jappy |first=M.J |year=2001 |publisher=Channel 4 books |isbn=0-7522-1938-3 |page=92}}</ref> Other non-combatants worked in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]]. For conscientious objectors exempted conditional upon performing civil work, acceptable occupations were [[farm]] work, [[mining]], [[firefighting]] and the [[Emergency medical services|ambulance service]]. About 5,500 objectors were imprisoned, most charged with refusal to attend a medical examination as a necessary preliminary to call-up after being refused exemption, and some charged with non-compliance with the terms of conditional exemption. A further 1,000 were court-martialled by the armed forces and sent to military detention barracks or civil prisons. Differently from the First World War, most sentences were relatively short, and there was no pattern of continually repeated sentences. Nevertheless, the social stigma attached to 'conchies' (as they were called) was considerable; regardless of the genuineness of their motives, cowardice was often imputed.\n\n[[Conscription in the United Kingdom]] was retained, with rights of conscientious objection, as [[National Service]] until the last call-up in 1960 and the last discharge in 1963. The use of all volunteer soldiers was hoped to remove the need to consider conscientious objectors. Ever since the First World War, however, there have been volunteer members of the armed forces who have developed a conscientious objection to continuing in service; a procedure was devised for them in the Second World War, and, with adaptations, it continues to this day.\n\n===United States===\n{{Main|Conscientious objection in the United States}}\n{{see also|New York Draft Riots|Conscription in the United States}}\nThere are currently legal provisions in the United States for recognizing conscientious objection, both through the [[Selective Service System]] and through the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]. The United States recognizes religious and moral objections, but not selective objections. Conscientious objectors in the United States may perform either civilian work or noncombatant service in lieu of combatant military service.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sss.gov/consobj |title=Conscientious Objection and Alternative Service |website=Selective Service System}}</ref>\n\nHistorically, conscientious objectors have been persecuted in the United States. After the Selective Service System was founded during [[World War I]], such persecutions decreased in frequency, and recognition for conscientious objectors grew.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n===Other countries===\nAs of 2005, conscientious objectors in several countries may serve as field paramedics in the army (although some do not consider this a genuine alternative, as they feel it merely helps to make war more humane instead of preventing it). Alternatively, they may serve without arms, although this, too, has its problems. In certain European countries such as [[Austria]], Greece and [[Switzerland]], there is the option of performing an alternative civilian service, subject to the review of a written application or after a hearing about the state of conscience. In Greece, the alternative civilian service is twice as long as the corresponding military service; in Austria ''[[Zivildienst in Austria|Zivildienst]]'' is one third times longer, the Swiss ''[[Swiss Civilian Service|Zivildienst]]'' is one and one-half times longer than military service. In 2005, the Swiss parliament considered whether willingness to serve one and a half times longer than an army recruit was sufficient proof of sincerity, citing that the cost of judging the state of conscience of a few thousand men per year was too great. In [[New Zealand]] during the First World War between 1,500 and 2,000 objectors and defaulters were convicted, or came under state control, for their opposition to war. At least 64 of these were still at [[Waikeria]] Prison on 5 March 1919 - some of whom had gone on hunger strike in protest. \n[[File:Waikeria_Prison_for_WW1_objectors,_c.1923_(27160240521).jpg|thumb|[[Waikeria]] Prison for WW1 objectors, c.1923 ]]\n\n==Conscientious objection in professional forces==\nOnly three European Union countries&nbsp;\u2013 Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom&nbsp;\u2013 recognize the right to conscientious objection for contract and professional military personnel.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[War Resisters' International]] |title=Professional Soldiers and the Right to Conscientious Objection in the European Union |date=October 2008 |page=6 |url=http://wri-irg.org/pdf/eu-rtba2008update-en.pdf |accessdate=2011-10-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118175710/http://wri-irg.org/pdf/eu-rtba2008update-en.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-18 }}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, military personnel who come to a conviction of conscientious objection during their tour of duty must appear in front of a panel of experts, which consists of psychiatrists, military chaplains and officers.\n\nIn Switzerland, the panel consists entirely of civilians, and military personnel have no authority whatsoever.

Many conscientious objectors cite religious reasons. [[Unitarian Universalists]] object to war in their sixth principle \"The goal of world community with peace, liberty and justice for all\". Members of the [[Peace Churches|Historic Peace Churches]] such as Quakers, Mennonites, [[Amish]], [[Old Order Mennonite]], [[Conservative Mennonites]], the [[Bruderhof Communities]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://gameo.org/index.php?title=Bruderhof_Communities|title=Bruderhof Communities - GAMEO|website=gameo.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-19}}</ref> and [[Church of the Brethren]] object to war from the conviction that Christian life is incompatible with military action, because [[Jesus]] enjoins his followers to love their enemies and to refuse violence.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsmax.com/FastFeatures/bruderhof-christians-beliefs-set/2015/05/07/id/643320/|title=5 Beliefs That Set the Bruderhof Apart From Other Christians|work=Newsmax|access-date=2017-12-19}}</ref> Since the American Civil War, [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] have been known as non-combatants, and have done work in hospitals or to give medical care rather than combat roles, and the church has upheld the non-combative position.<ref>http://www.sidadventist.org/lead/index.php/resources/essent/89-leadership{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and [[Christadelphians]], refuse to participate in the armed services on the grounds that they believe they should be neutral in worldly conflicts and often cite the latter portion of [http://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Isaiah+2:4%E2%80%932:4&version=nrsv Isaiah 2:4] which states, \"...neither shall they learn war anymore.\" Other objections can stem from a deep sense of responsibility toward humanity as a whole, or from simple denial that any government possesses the [[moral authority]] to command warlike behavior from its citizens.\n\nThe varied experiences of non-combatants are illustrated by those of Seventh-day Adventists when there was mandatory military service:  \"Many Seventh-day Adventists refuse to enter the army as combatants, but participate as medics, ambulance drivers, etc. During World War II in Germany, many SDA conscientious objectors were sent to concentration camps or mental institutions; some were executed. Some Seventh-day Adventists volunteered for the US Army's [[Operation Whitecoat]], participating in research to help others. The Church preferred to call them \"conscientious participants\", because they were willing to risk their lives as test subjects in potentially life-threatening research. Over 2,200 Seventh-day Adventists volunteered in experiments involving various infectious agents during the 1950s through the 1970s in Fort Detrick, MD.\"<ref>[http://www.religioustolerance.org/sda3.htm \"The Seventh-day Adventist Church: Controversies, books and other resources\"],''religioustolerance.org,''Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance.</ref> Earlier, a [[Schism (religion)|schism]] arose during and after World War I between Seventh-day Adventists in Germany who agreed to serve in the military if conscripted and those who rejected all participation in warfare\u2014the latter group eventually forming a separate church (the [[Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement]]).<ref>[http://www.sdarm.org/origin.htm \"Origin of the Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815073949/http://www.sdarm.org/origin.htm |date=2010-08-15 }}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Blessed are the Peacemakers.gif|alt=|thumb|''Blessed are the Peacemakers'' (1917) by [[George Bellows]] ]]\n\nIn the [[early Christian Church]] followers of [[Christ]] refused to take up arms.\n\n{{cquote|In as much as they [Jesus' teachings] ruled out as illicit all use of violence and injury against others, clearly implied [was] the illegitimacy of participation in war ...

They closely identified their religion with peace; they strongly condemned war for the bloodshed which it involved.|{{cite book|title=The Early Christian Attitude to War}}}}\n\nAfter the [[Roman Empire]] officially embraced [[Christianity]], the [[Just War]] theology was developed in order to reconcile warfare with Christian belief. After Theodosius I made Christianity an official religion of the Empire, this position slowly developed into the official position of the Western Church. In the 11th century, there was a further shift of opinion in the Latin-Christian tradition with the [[crusade]]s, strengthening the idea and acceptability of [[religious war|Holy War]]. Objectors became a minority. Some theologians see the [[Constantinian shift]] and the loss of  [[Christian pacifism]] as a great failing of the Church.\n\n[[Ben Salmon]] was a Catholic conscientious objector during World War I and outspoken critic of Just War theology. The Catholic Church denounced him and ''The New York Times'' described him as a \"spy suspect\". The US military (in which he was never inducted) charged him with desertion and spreading propaganda, then sentenced him to death (this was later revised to 25 years hard labor).<ref>{{Cite journal| author = Staff of the Catholic Peace Fellowship| year= 2007| title=The Life and Witness of Ben Salmon| journal = Sign of Peace | volume = 6.1| issue = Spring 2007| pages =| id =| url =http://www.catholicpeacefellowship.org/nextpage.asp?m=2524}}</ref> On June 5, 1917, Salmon wrote in a letter to President Wilson:\n\n{{cquote|Regardless of nationality, all men are brothers. God is \"our Father who art in heaven\". The commandment \"Thou shalt not kill\" is unconditional and inexorable. ... The lowly Nazarene taught us the doctrine of non-resistance, and so convinced was he of the soundness of that doctrine that he sealed his belief with death on the cross. When human law conflicts with Divine law, my duty is clear. Conscience, my infallible guide, impels me to tell you that prison, death, or both, are infinitely preferable to joining any branch of the Army.<ref>{{cite book|title=Unsung Hero of the Great War: The Life and Witness of Ben Salmon|year=1989|author=Torin Finney|pages= 118\u2013119}}</ref>}}\n\nBecause of their conscientious objection to participation in military service, whether armed or unarmed, Jehovah's Witnesses have often faced imprisonment or other penalties. In [[Greece]], for example, before the introduction of alternative civilian service in 1997, hundreds of Witnesses were imprisoned, some for three years or even more for their refusal. In [[Armenia]], young Jehovah's Witnesses were imprisoned because of their conscientious objection to military service; this was discontinued in November 2013.<ref>[http://www.jw.org/en/news/by-region/europe/armenia/armenia-releases-imprisoned-jehovahs-witnesses/ Armenia Releases All Imprisoned Jehovah's Witnesses].</ref> The government of South Korea also imprisons hundreds for refusing the draft. In [[Switzerland]], virtually every Jehovah's Witness is exempted from military service. The [[Finland|Finnish]] government exempts Jehovah's Witnesses from the draft completely.\n\nFor believers in [[Indian religions]], the opposition to warfare may be based on either the general idea of [[ahimsa]], [[nonviolence]], or on an explicit prohibition of violence by their religion, e.g., for a [[Buddhist]], one of the [[five precepts]] is \"P\u0101n\u0101tip\u0101t\u0101 verama\u1e47i sikkh\u0101padam sam\u0101diy\u0101mi\", or \"I undertake the precept to refrain from destroying living creatures\", which is in obvious opposition to the practice of warfare. The [[14th Dalai Lama]] has stated that war \"should be relegated to the dustbin of history\". On the other hand, many Buddhist sects, especially in Japan, have been thoroughly militarized, warrior monks (''yamabushi'' or ''[[s\u014dhei]]'') participating in the civil wars. Hindu beliefs do not go against the concept of war, as seen in the [[Gita]]. Both Sikhs and Hindus believe war should be a last resort and should be fought to sustain life and morality in society.\n\n[[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith|Bah\u00e1'\u00eds]] are advised to do social service instead of active army service, but when this is not possible because of obligations in certain countries, the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed laws|Bah\u00e1'\u00ed law]] of ''loyalty to one's government'' is preferred and the individual should perform the army service.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://bahai-library.com/mazal_comparison_christianity_bahai&chapter=1 | title = Selected Topics of Comparison in Christianity and the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith | accessdate = 13 September 2006 | first = Peter |last = Mazal | date = 21 October 2003}}</ref><ref name=\"ud1\">{{Cite book|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/UD/ud-136.html | first = Shoghi | last = Effendi |authorlink = Shoghi Effendi|title = Unfolding Destiny|pages = 134\u2013135}}</ref>\n\nSome practitioners of [[paganism|pagan religions]], particularly [[Wicca]], may object on the grounds of the [[Wiccan rede]], which states \"An it harm none, do what ye will\" (or variations). The [[threefold law]] may also be grounds for objection.\n\nA notable example of a conscientious objector was the [[Austrians|Austrian]] devout [[Roman Catholic]] Christian [[Franz J\u00e4gerst\u00e4tter]], who was executed on August 9, 1943 for openly refusing to serve in the Nazi [[Wehrmacht]], consciously accepting the penalty of death. He was [[Beatification|declared Blessed]] by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in 2007 for dying for his beliefs, and is viewed as a symbol of self-sacrificing resistance.\n\n==Alternatives for objectors==\nSome conscientious objectors are unwilling to serve the military in any capacity, while others accept noncombatant roles. While conscientious objection is usually the refusal to collaborate with military organizations, as a combatant in war or in any supportive role, some advocate compromising forms of conscientious objection. One compromising form is to accept [[non-combatant]] roles during conscription or [[military service]]. Alternatives to military or civilian service include serving an imprisonment or other punishment for refusing conscription, falsely claiming unfitness for duty by feigning an allergy or a heart condition, delaying conscription until the maximum drafting age, or seeking refuge in a country which does not extradite those wanted for military conscription. Avoiding military service is sometimes labeled [[draft dodger|draft dodging]], particularly if the goal is accomplished through dishonesty or evasive maneuvers. However, many people who support conscription will distinguish between \"[[bona fide]]\" ''conscientious objection'' and ''draft dodging'', which they view as evasion of military service without a valid excuse.\n\nConservative Mennonites do not object to serving their country in peaceful alternatives ([[alternative service]]) such as hospital work, farming, forestry, road construction and similar occupations. Their objection is in being part in any military capacity whether noncombatant or regular service. During World War II and the Korean, Vietnam war eras they served in many such capacities in alternative I-W service programs initially through the Mennonite Central Committee and now through their own alternatives.\n\nDespite the fact that international institutions such as the United Nations (UN) and the [[Council of Europe]] (CoE) regard and promote conscientious objection as a human right,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www1.law.nyu.edu/journals/jilp/issues/33/pdf/33n.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122030613/http://www1.law.nyu.edu/journals/jilp/issues/33/pdf/33n.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=22 November 2011 |title=THE STATUS OF CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTION UNDER ARTICLE 4 OF THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS, 33 N.Y.U.

In many countries outside Europe, especially in armed conflict areas (e.g. [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]), conscientious objection is punished severely.\n\nWhile conscientious objectors used to be seen as deserters, traitors, cowards, slackers or simply un-patriotic, their image has changed drastically in the Western world in past decades.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Especially in Europe, where objectors usually serve an alternative civilian service, they are regarded as making an equally important contribution to society as conscripts.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Parallel to that, the number of objectors has risen significantly.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}. In 1991, The Peace Abbey established the National Registry for Conscientious Objection where people can publicly state their refusal to participate in armed conflict.\n\n==Conscientious objection around the world==\n\n===Belgium===\nConscription was mandatory to all able-bodied [[Belgium|Belgian]] males until 1994, when it was suspended. Civilian service was possible since 1963. Objectors could apply for the status of conscience objector. When granted, they did an alternative service with the civil service or with a socio-cultural organisation. The former would last 1.5 times as long as the shortest military service, the latter twice as long.\n\nAfter their service, objectors are not allowed to take jobs that require them to carry weapons, such as police jobs, until the age of 42.\n\nSince conscription was suspended in 1994 and military service is voluntary, the status of conscience objector can not be granted anymore in Belgium.\n\n===Canada===\n{{see also|Canada and Iraq War resisters|War Resisters Support Campaign}}\n\nMennonites and other similar peace churches in Canada were automatically exempt from any type of service during [[Military history of Canada during World War I|Canada's involvement in World War I]] by provisions of the [[Order in Council]] of 1873 yet initially, many were imprisoned until the matter was again resettled. With pressure of public opinion, the Canadian government barred entry of additional [[Mennonite]] and [[Hutterite]] immigrants, rescinding the privileges of the Order in Council.<ref>Smith, p. 321. The [[Conscription Crisis of 1917]] also barred immigrants and objectors from voting.\n\nThis bar on entry was overturned in the 1920s, allowing immigrants to escape Soviet repression.</ref> During [[Military history of Canada during the Second World War|Canada's involvement in World War II]], Canadian conscientious objectors were given the options of noncombatant military service, serving in the medical or dental corps under military control or working in parks and on roads under civilian supervision.

During the [[Finnish Civil War]] in 1918, conscription was reintroduced for all able-bodied men. In 1922, the option of noncombatant military service was introduced, but service in the military remained compulsory on pain of imprisonment. After the struggle of pacifist [[Arndt Pekurinen]] a law was passed providing for a peacetime-only alternative to military service, or civilian service (Finnish ''siviilipalvelus''). The law was dubbed \"Lex Pekurinen\" after him. During the [[Winter War]], Pekurinen and other conscientious objectors were imprisoned, and Pekurinen was eventually executed at the front in 1941, during the [[Continuation War]].\n\nAfter the war, a conscientious objector's civilian service lasted 16 months, whereas military service was 8 months at its shortest. To qualify for civilian service, an objector had to explain his conviction before a board of inspection that included military officers and clergymen. In 1987, the duration of the service was shortened to 13 months and the board of inspection was abolished. In 2008, the term was further shortened to 12 months to match the duration of the longest military service (that of officer trainees and technical crew). Today, a person subject to conscription may apply for civilian service at any time before or during his military service, and the application is accepted as a matter of course. A female performing voluntary military service can quit her service anytime during the first 45 days, however, if she wants to quit after those 45 days she would be treated like a male and assigned to civilian service.\n\nPersons who have completed their civilian service during peacetime have, according to the legislation enacted in 2008, the right to serve in non-military duties also during a crisis situation. They may be called to serve in various duties with the rescue services or other necessary work of a non-military nature. Persons who declare themselves to be conscientious objectors only after a crisis has started must, however, prove their conviction before a special board. Before the new legislation, the right to conscientious objection was acknowledged only in peacetime. The changes to the service term and to the legal status of objectors during a crisis situation were made as a response to human rights concerns voiced by several international bodies,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aseistakieltaytyjaliitto.fi/ihmisoikeuselimet.html|title=Suomi syrjii aseistakielt\u00e4ytyji\u00e4! - AKL|website=aseistakieltaytyjaliitto.fi|accessdate=12 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070726143012/http://www.aseistakieltaytyjaliitto.fi/ihmisoikeuselimet.html|archive-date=26 July 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/CCPR.CO.82.FIN.En?Opendocument|title=unhchr.ch|website=unhchr.ch|accessdate=12 August 2017}}</ref> who are overseeing the implementation of human rights agreements. These organisations had demanded Finland to take measures to improve its legislation concerning conscientious objectors, which they considered discriminatory. None of these organisations have yet raised concerns on the current legislation.\n\nThere are a small number of total objectors who refuse even civilian service, and are imprisoned for six months. This is not registered into the person's criminal record.\n<!---Text from [[Conscientious objection throughout the world]] - needs merging into existing text -\nFor many decades, the civilian service remained unpopular and difficult to choose. Refusing military service would have been very strongly discouraged by all state officials, and getting accepted as a conscientious objector required a trial by an examination board, whose judgement was often very harsh and strongly biased towards military service. These boards included army officers and clergy. A typical hypothetical presented to the examinee was \"If a group of men threatened to beat your girlfriend up, would you try to stop them?\".\n\nThe examinations were abolished in the 1980s, and today a conscientious objector is only required to check a box in the draft form and state whether his reasons are religious or ethical. Severe social stigma attachs to conscientious objection, and the military, which is responsible for the draft, does not advertise the option beyond their legal obligation to mention the option to draftees.\n\nThe civilian service of conscientious objectors lasts 395 days, over twice as long as the shortest and most common military service (180 days) and thirty days longer than the longest and mostly voluntary service (365 days).\n\nThe first four weeks of the civilian service are spent in training, which mostly consists of general-purpose lectures on various topics. The first three weeks of the training are held at the [[Lapinj\u00e4rvi Educational Center]], and the fourth week is a free vacation.\n\nIn Finland today, the right to conscientious objection is still acknowledged only in peacetime. In recent years several international bodies<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aseistakieltaytyjaliitto.fi/ihmisoikeuselimet.html|title=Suomi syrjii aseistakielt\u00e4ytyji\u00e4! - AKL|website=aseistakieltaytyjaliitto.fi|accessdate=12 August 2017}}</ref> (for example UN's Human Rights Committee<ref name=\"unhchr.ch\">{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/CCPR.CO.82.FIN.En?Opendocument|title=unhchr.ch|website=unhchr.ch|accessdate=12 August 2017}}</ref>), who are overseeing the implementation of human rights agreements, have demanded Finland to take measures to improve its legislation concerning COs, since they have found it to be discriminatory. Sources of criticism have been the punitive length of the civilian alternative to military service, the release of conscientious objectors from military duty only during peace time and the negligence in arranging accommodation for the servicemen{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}. Since 1999, [[Amnesty International]]<ref name=\"amnesty.org\">https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur20/001/1999/en/</ref> has considered Finnish ''total objectors'', who have refused to carry out non-military service, as prisoners of conscience, because of the punitive length of civilian service.\n\nThe main 12-month period of service can be performed in any institution that is both non-profit and beneficial to the society. Examples include state bureaus, schools, universities, hospitals, libraries, theatres and independent non-profit organisations such as [[Amnesty International]]. Institutions wishing to accept conscientious objectors must comply with rules laid down by the Finnish Ministry of Labour.\n\nFrom the state's point of view, conscientious objectors are subject to the same rights and obligations as military enlisted men. How the service is handled in practice depends on the place of service, but a typical service consists of a common 40-hour week in the institution.\n\nSome 2,500 men opt for the civilian service every year, which is ca. 10% of the men drafted.\n\nMen who refuse both the military and the civilian services are known as total objectors (Finnish ''totaalikielt\u00e4ytyj\u00e4''). Total objectors are sentenced unconditionally to a prison term equal to half their remaining service. In 2002, some 80 men were convicted as total objectors. It is usual for total objectors to cite in their defence the Finnish Constitution, several international human rights bodies (for example UN's Human Rights Committee<ref name=\"unhchr.ch\"/>), and the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which bans forced labour except in emergencies and wartime, as well as the arguably discriminatory and unconstitutional exemption from military service granted to women, men living in demilitarised \u00c5land and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]].\n\nSince 1999, [[Amnesty International]]<ref name=\"amnesty.org\"/> have considered the excessive length, as compared to military service, of the civilian service to be punitive and accordingly classifies Finnish total objectors as [prisoners of conscience]. In one recent case (namely ''Case-Hermaja''<ref>http://www.hermaja.org/</ref>), a total objector Jussi Hermaja has sought asylum from another country, Belgium. While asylum was eventually not granted, he was not extradited because the state of Finland never filed a formal request.\n\nSince some 80% of Finnish men undergo military service and since military training and rank are considered merits at the job market, conscientious objectors experience discrimination. A reserve officer's or NCO's rank is considered a more significant merit for management positions than university degrees or work experience (see [[management by perkele]]). However, in most cases employers legally have no defensible reason to favour or even ask about a candidate's military training.--->\n\n===France===\n[[File:Objecteurs.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Stamp created by the ''Centre de d\u00e9fense des objecteurs de conscience'' (around 1936).]]\nThe creation of a legal status for conscientious objectors in France was the subject of a long struggle involving for instance or the much-publicised trials of Protestant activists [[Jacques Martin (pacifist)|Jacques Martin]], Philippe Vernier and Camille Rombault in 1932\u20131933<ref name = JPC>Jean-Paul Cahn, Fran\u00e7oise Knopper, Anne-Marie Saint-Gille, De la Guerre juste \u00e0 la paix juste: Aspects confessionnels de la construction de la paix dans l'espace franco-allemand (XVIe-XXe si\u00e8cle), Collection Histoire et civilisations, Presses Universitaires Septentrion, 2008, 313 pages, {{ISBN|9782757400388}}, p.168</ref> or the hunger strike of [[anarchist]] [[Louis Lecoin]] in 1962.\n\nThe legal status law was passed in December 1963, 43 years (and many prison sentences) after the first requests.\n\nIn 1983, a new law passed by socialist Interior Minister [[Pierre Joxe]] considerably improved this status, simplifying the conditions under which the status would be granted. Conscientious objectors were then free to choose an activity in the social realm where they would spend their civil service time. However, in order to avoid too many applications for civil service at the expense of the military, the duration of the civil service is however kept twice as long as the military service.\n\nThe effect of these laws was suspended in 2001 when compulsory military service was abolished in France. The special prison at Strasbourg for Jehovah's Witnesses, who refuse to join any military, was also abolished.\n\nSince 1986, the associations defending conscientious objection in France have chosen to celebrate their cause on 15 May.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wri-irg.org/fr/node/1394|title=15 mai \u2013 Journ\u00e9e internationale de l'objection de conscience - Internationale des R\u00e9sistant(e)s \u00e0 la Guerre|website=wri-irg.org|accessdate=12 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815132422/http://www.wri-irg.org/fr/node/1394|archive-date=15 August 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Germany===\n{{Main|Conscription in Germany}}\n====Nazi Germany====\nIn [[Nazi Germany]], conscientious objection was not recognized in the law. In theory, objectors would be drafted and then court-martialled for desertion. The practice was even harsher: going beyond the letter of an already extremely flexible law, conscientious objection was considered [[Wehrkraftzersetzung|subversion of military strength]], a crime normally punished with death. On September 15, 1939 August Dickmann, a Jehovah's Witness, and the first conscientious objector of the war to be executed, died by a firing squad at the [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]].<ref>September 17, 1939 ''The New York Times'' See also:  ''A Teacher's Guide to the Holocaust'' by Florida Center for Instructional Technology [http://fcit.usf.edu/holocaust/people/JWTIMELN.HTM]</ref> Among others, [[Franz J\u00e4gerst\u00e4tter]] was executed after his conscientious objection, on the grounds that he could not fight in the forces of the evil side.\n\n====East Germany====\n{{Main|Conscientious objection in East Germany}}\nAfter World War II in [[East Germany]], there was no official right to conscientious objection. Nevertheless, and uniquely among the Eastern bloc, objections were accepted and the objectors assigned to construction units. They were however part of the military, so that a fully civilian alternative did not exist. Also, \"[[construction soldier|construction soldiers]]\" were discriminated against in their later professional life.<ref>[[Bernd Eisenfeld]]: Das Verh\u00e4ltnis der Partei- und Staatsf\u00fchrung der DDR zu den Bausoldaten a) die agitatorische Diskriminierung der Bausoldaten b) die substantielle Diskriminierung der Bausoldaten. pp. 115\u2013125. in: Kriegsdienstverweigerung in der DDR&nbsp;\u2013 ein Friedensdienst?

''In German''</ref>\n\n====West Germany and reunified Germany====\nAccording to Article 4(3) of the [[Grundgesetz|German constitution]]: \"No person may be forced against their conscience to perform armed military service. Details shall be regulated by a federal law.\"\n\nAccording to Article 12a, a law may be passed to require every male from the age of 18 to military service called ''Wehrdienst''; also, a law can require conscientious objectors to perform non-military service instead called ''Wehrersatzdienst'', literally \"military replacement service\", or colloquially ''[[Zivildienst]]''. These laws were applicable and demanded compulsory service in the German [[Bundeswehr|armed forces]] (German: ''Bundeswehr'') until the abolition of draft in 2011. Initially, each conscientious objectors had to appear in person to a panel hearing at the draft office (or contest a negative decision at the [[administrative court]]). The suspension of the procedure (1977), allowing to \"object with a post card\", was ruled unconstitutional in 1978. Beginning in 1983, competence was shifted to the ''Kreiswehrersatzamt'' (military replacement office), which had discretion to either approve or reject a conscientious objection, which had to consist of a detailed written statement by an applicant giving reasons as to why the applicant was conscientiously objecting. This was generally just a formality, and objections were not often rejected. In later years in particular however, with the rise of the Internet, conscientious objections fell into disrepute because of the ease of being able to simply download existing example objections. It earned some conscientious objections the suspicion of an applicant simply attempting an easy way out of military service. On the other hand, certain organizations within the German peace movement had been offering pamphlets for decades giving suggestions to applicants as to the proper wording and structure of an objection which would have the greatest chances of success.\n\nFollowing a 1985 Federal Constitution Court decision, Wehrersatzdienst could be no simple choice of convenience for an applicant, but he had to cite veritable conflict of conscience which made him unable to perform any kind of military service at all. If there was doubt about the true nature of an objector's application, he could be summoned to appear before a panel at the Kreiswehrersatzamt to explain his reasons in person. An approved conscientious objection in any case then meant that an applicant was required by law to perform Wehrersatzdienst. Complete objection both to military and replacement service was known as ''Totalverweigerung''; it was illegal and could be punished with a fine or a suspended custodial sentence.\n\nNearly the only legal way to get both out of military service and replacement service was to be deemed physically unfit for military service. Both men who entered military service and those who wanted to go into replacement service had to pass a military physical examination at the military replacement office. Five categories/levels of physical fitness, or ''Tauglichkeitsstufen'', existed. ''Tauglichkeitsstufe 5'', in short ''T5'', meant that a person was rejected for military service and thus also did not need to enter replacement service. ''T5'' status was usually only granted if a person had physical or mental disabilities or was otherwise significantly impaired, such as due to very poor eyesight or debilitating chronic illnesses.\n\nAnother way to get out of service completely was the ''two brothers rule'', which stated that if two older brothers had already served in the military, any following male children of a family were exempt from service.\n\nDue to [[West Berlin]]'s special status between the end of the Second World War and 1990 as a city governed by foreign military powers, draft did not apply within its borders. This made Berlin a safe haven for many young people who chose to move to the city to prevent criminal court repercussions for ''Totalverweigerung''. As ''Totalverweigerer'' were often part of the far-left political spectrum, this was one factor which spawned a politically active left-wing and left-wing radical scene in the city.\n\nWehrersatzdienst was for a long time considerably longer than military service, by up to a third, even when the duration of service was gradually reduced following reunification and the end of the Cold War. This was held by some as a violation of constitutional principles, but was upheld in several court decisions based on the reasoning that former service personnel could be redrafted for military exercises called ''Wehr\u00fcbungen'', while somebody who had served out his replacement service could not. Moreover, work conditions under military service typically involved more hardship and inconvenience than Wehrersatzdienst. In 2004, military service and Wehrersatzdienst were then made to last equal lengths of time.\n\nMilitary service and draft were controversial during much of their existence. Reasons included the consideration that Germans could be made to fight against their fellow Germans in East Germany. Moreover, draft only applied to men, which was seen as gender based discrimination by some, but was often countered by the argument that women usually gave up their careers either temporarily or permanently to raise their children. With the end of the Cold War and the German military's primary purpose of defending its home territory increasingly looking doubtful, draft also began to become more arbitrary, as only certain portions of a particular birth year were drafted (usually those in very healthy physical condition), while others weren't. This was seen as a problem of ''Wehrgerechtigkeit'', or equal justice of military service.\n\nThen-German President [[Roman Herzog]] said in a 1994 speech (which was frequently cited as an argument for draft abolition) that only the necessity for national defense, not any other arguments can justify draft. On the other hand, this logic tended to not be extended to men serving Wehrersatzdienst, as they usually worked in fields of public health, [[elderly care]], medical assistance or assistance for the disabled. Their relatively low-paid work was seen as an ever more important backbone of a health sector which was grappling with rapidly increasing costs of care.\n\nIn 2011 the mandatory draft was abolished in Germany, mainly due to a perceived lack of aforementioned necessity. The ''Bundeswehr'' now solely relies on service members who deliberately choose it as a career path. Neither Article 12a (establishing the possibility of draft) nor Article 4 (3) (permitting conscientious objection) have been removed from the German Constitution. In theory, this makes a full reversion to draft (and Wehrersatzdienst) possible, if it is thought to be necessary.\n\n===Israel===\n{{main|Refusal to serve in the IDF}}\nAll Israeli citizens and permanent residents are liable to military service. However, the Ministry of Defense has used its discretion under article 36 of this law to automatically exempt all non-Jewish women and all Arab men, except for the Druze, from military service ever since Israel was established. Israeli Arabs may volunteer to perform military service, but very few do so (except among the Bedouin population of Israel).<ref name=\"wri-irg.org\">{{cite web|url=http://wri-irg.org/co/co-isr-03.htm|title=Conscientious objection to military service in Israel: an unrecognised human right - War Resisters' International|website=wri-irg.org|accessdate=12 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121141156/http://wri-irg.org/co/co-isr-03.htm|archive-date=21 January 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn discussing the status of the armed forces shortly after the founding of the State of Israel, representatives of orthodox religious parties argued that yeshiva students should be exempt from military service. This derives from the Jewish tradition that if a man wants to dedicate his life to religious study, society must allow him to do so. The request of orthodox political parties to 'prevent neglect of studying the Torah' was granted by the authorities. But in recent years this exemption practice has become the subject of debate in Israeli society, as the absolute and the relative numbers of the men who received this exemption rose sharply.<ref>From the [[Torato Omanuto]] entry: \"from 800 men in 1968 to 41,450 in 2005 compared to 7 million for the entire population of Israel.

Those who were born in the last months of the year typically used to serve in the Navy, unless judged unable for ship service (in this case they could be sent back to Army or Air Force). Until 1972, objectors were considered as [[Treason|traitors]] and tried by a military tribunal; after 1972, objectors could choose an alternative civilian service, which was eight months longer than standard military service (fifteen months, then twelve, as for Army and Air Force, 24 months, then eighteen, then twelve as for the Navy){{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}. Since such length was judged too punitive, an arrangement was made to make the civilian service as long as the military service.

Thousands of ''insumisos'' (non-submittants) publicly refused the PSS, and hundreds were imprisoned. In addition a number of those in the military decided to refuse further duties. A number of people not liable for military service made declarations of self-incrimination, stating that they had encouraged ''insumisi\u00f3n''. The government, fearing popular reaction, reduced the length of service and instead of sentencing ''insumisos'' to prison declared them unfit for public service.\n\nFronting the decreasing birth rate and the popular opposition to the army, the Spanish government tried to modernise the model carried from the [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] era, professionalizing it.

The draft was withdrawn afterwards.\n\nA commission was founded within the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|National Assembly of the Republic]] to write a new constitution in 2012. The commission is still in negotiations on various articles and conscientious objection is one of the most controversial issues.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{Further|Conscription in the United Kingdom}}\nThe United Kingdom recognised the right of individuals not to fight in the 18th century following problems with attempting to force Quakers into military service. The Militia Ballot Act of 1757 allowed Quakers to be excluded from service in the [[Militia (Great Britain)|Militia]]. It then ceased to be a major issue, since Britain's armed forces were generally all-volunteer. However, [[press gangs]] were used to beef up army and navy rolls on occasions from the 16th to the early 19th centuries. Pressed men did have the right of appeal, in the case of sailors, to the [[Admiralty]]. The [[Royal Navy]] last took pressed men in the [[Napoleonic War]].\n\n[[File:Conscientious Objector memorial, Tavistock Sq Gardens.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Conscientious Objector memorial in [[Tavistock Square]] Gardens, London&nbsp;\u2014 dedicated on [[May 15#Holidays and observances|15 May]] 1994]]\n\nA more general right to refuse military service was not introduced until the [[First World War]]. Britain introduced conscription with the [[Military Service Act (United Kingdom)|Military Service Act]] of January 1916, which came into full effect on 2 March 1916. The Act allowed for objectors to be absolutely exempted, to perform alternative civilian service, or to serve as a non-combatant in the army's [[Non-Combatant Corps]], according to the extent to which they could convince a [[Military Service Tribunals|Military Service Tribunal]] of the quality of their objection.<ref>A.J.P. Taylor, ''English History, 1914\u20131945'' (Oxford University Press, 1990), p116.</ref>\n\nAround 16,000 men were recorded as conscientious objectors, with Quakers, traditionally pacifist, forming a large proportion: 4,500 objectors were exempted on condition of doing civilian 'work of national importance', such as farming, forestry or social service; and 7,000 were conscripted into the specially-created Non-Combatant Corps. However, 6,000 were refused any exemption and forced into main army regiments; if they then refused to obey orders, they were [[Court-martial#United Kingdom|court-martialled]] and sent to prison. Thus, the well-known pacifist and religious writer [[Stephen Henry Hobhouse]] was called up in 1916: he and many other Quaker activists took the unconditionalist stand, refusing both military and alternative service, and on enforced enlistment were court-martialled and imprisoned for disobedience.<ref>Brock, Peter,''These strange criminals: an anthology of prison memoirs by conscientious objectors to military service from the Great War to the Cold War'', p. 14, Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0802087078}}</ref> Conscientious objectors formed only a tiny proportion of Military Service Tribunals' cases over the whole conscription period, estimated at around 2%.<ref>Adrian Gregory, 'Military Service Tribunals, 1916\u20131918' in J.

Conscientious objectors who were deemed not to have made any useful contribution to the state were formally [[Disfranchisement|disfranchised]] (through a clause inserted in the [[Representation of the People Act 1918]] at the insistence of back-bench MPs) for the five years 1 September 1921 - 31 August 1926, but as it was a last-minute amendment there was no administrative machinery to enforce such disfranchisement, which was admitted to be a \"dead letter\".<ref>[[A. J. P. Taylor]], ''English History, 1914\u20131945'' (Oxford University Press, 1990), p. 116; [http://www.spartacus-educational.com/FWWpacifists.htm FWW Pacifists] at spartacus-educational.com</ref>\n\nBritain's conscription legislation of 1916 did not apply to [[Ireland]], despite it being then all part of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. However, in 1918 the Army's continuing demand for more troops led to passing a further act enabling conscription in Ireland if and when the government saw fit. In the event, the government never saw fit, although the legislation led to the [[Conscription Crisis of 1918]]. Similarly, British conscription in the [[Second World War]] did not apply to [[Northern Ireland]]. Nevertheless, many [[Irishmen]] volunteered to fight in both world wars. The various parts of the [[British Empire]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] had their own laws: in general, all the larger countries of the Empire participated, and some were, in proportion to their population, major participants in the First World War.\n\nIn the Second World War, following the [[National Service (Armed Forces) Act 1939]], there were nearly 60,000 registered Conscientious Objectors. Testing by tribunals resumed, this time by special Conscientious Objection Tribunals chaired by a judge, and the effects were much less harsh. If you were not a member of the Quakers or some similar pacifist organisation, it was generally enough to say that you objected to \"warfare as a means of settling international disputes\", a phrase from the [[Kellogg-Briand Pact]] of 1928. The tribunals could grant full exemption, exemption conditional on alternative service, exemption only from combatant duties, or dismiss the application. Of the 61,000 who were registered, 3,000 were given complete exemption; 18,000 applications were initially dismissed, but a number of such applicants succeeded at the Appellate Tribunal, sometimes after a \"qualifying\" sentence of three-months' imprisonment for an offence deemed to have been committed on grounds of conscience. Of those directed to non-combatant military service almost 7,000 were allocated to the Non-Combatant Corps, re-activated in mid-1940; its companies worked in clothing and food stores, in transport, or any military project not requiring the handling of \"material of an aggressive nature\". In November 1940 it was decided to allow troops in the NCC to volunteer for work in [[bomb disposal]].<ref name=UXB92 /> In total over 350 volunteered.<ref name=UXB92>{{cite book |title= Danger UXB The Remarkable Story of the Disposal of Unexploded Bombs During the Second World War |last=Jappy |first=M.J |year=2001 |publisher=Channel 4 books |isbn=0-7522-1938-3 |page=92}}</ref> Other non-combatants worked in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]]. For conscientious objectors exempted conditional upon performing civil work, acceptable occupations were [[farm]] work, [[mining]], [[firefighting]] and the [[Emergency medical services|ambulance service]]. About 5,500 objectors were imprisoned, most charged with refusal to attend a medical examination as a necessary preliminary to call-up after being refused exemption, and some charged with non-compliance with the terms of conditional exemption. A further 1,000 were court-martialled by the armed forces and sent to military detention barracks or civil prisons. Differently from the First World War, most sentences were relatively short, and there was no pattern of continually repeated sentences. Nevertheless, the social stigma attached to 'conchies' (as they were called) was considerable; regardless of the genuineness of their motives, cowardice was often imputed.\n\n[[Conscription in the United Kingdom]] was retained, with rights of conscientious objection, as [[National Service]] until the last call-up in 1960 and the last discharge in 1963. The use of all volunteer soldiers was hoped to remove the need to consider conscientious objectors. Ever since the First World War, however, there have been volunteer members of the armed forces who have developed a conscientious objection to continuing in service; a procedure was devised for them in the Second World War, and, with adaptations, it continues to this day.\n\n===United States===\n{{Main|Conscientious objection in the United States}}\n{{see also|New York Draft Riots|Conscription in the United States}}\nThere are currently legal provisions in the United States for recognizing conscientious objection, both through the [[Selective Service System]] and through the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]. The United States recognizes religious and moral objections, but not selective objections. Conscientious objectors in the United States may perform either civilian work or noncombatant service in lieu of combatant military service.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sss.gov/consobj |title=Conscientious Objection and Alternative Service |website=Selective Service System}}</ref>\n\nHistorically, conscientious objectors have been persecuted in the United States. After the Selective Service System was founded during [[World War I]], such persecutions decreased in frequency, and recognition for conscientious objectors grew.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n===Other countries===\nAs of 2005, conscientious objectors in several countries may serve as field paramedics in the army (although some do not consider this a genuine alternative, as they feel it merely helps to make war more humane instead of preventing it). Alternatively, they may serve without arms, although this, too, has its problems. In certain European countries such as [[Austria]], Greece and [[Switzerland]], there is the option of performing an alternative civilian service, subject to the review of a written application or after a hearing about the state of conscience. In Greece, the alternative civilian service is twice as long as the corresponding military service; in Austria ''[[Zivildienst in Austria|Zivildienst]]'' is one third times longer, the Swiss ''[[Swiss Civilian Service|Zivildienst]]'' is one and one-half times longer than military service. In 2005, the Swiss parliament considered whether willingness to serve one and a half times longer than an army recruit was sufficient proof of sincerity, citing that the cost of judging the state of conscience of a few thousand men per year was too great. In [[New Zealand]] during the First World War between 1,500 to 2,000 objectors and defaulters were convicted, or came under state control, for their opposition to war. At least 64 of these were still at [[Waikeria]] Prison on 5 March 1919 - some of whom had gone on hunger strike in protest. \n[[File:Waikeria_Prison_for_WW1_objectors,_c.1923_(27160240521).jpg|thumb|[[Waikeria]] Prison for WW1 objectors, c.1923 ]]\n\n==Conscientious objection in professional forces==\nOnly three European Union countries&nbsp;\u2013 Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom&nbsp;\u2013 recognize the right to conscientious objection for contract and professional military personnel.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[War Resisters' International]] |title=Professional Soldiers and the Right to Conscientious Objection in the European Union |date=October 2008 |page=6 |url=http://wri-irg.org/pdf/eu-rtba2008update-en.pdf |accessdate=2011-10-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118175710/http://wri-irg.org/pdf/eu-rtba2008update-en.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-18 }}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, military personnel who come to a conviction of conscientious objection during their tour of duty must appear in front of a panel of experts, which consists of psychiatrists, military chaplains and officers.\n\nIn Switzerland, the panel consists entirely of civilians, and military personnel have no authority whatsoever.

Graphic treatment of interface elements is often perceived as the visual design.  The purpose of visual design is to use visual elements like colors, images, and symbols to convey a message to its audience.

User modeling or [[Persona (user experience)|personas]] are composite archetypes based on behavior patterns uncovered during research. Personas provide designers a precise way of thinking and communicating about how groups of users behave, how they think, what they want to accomplish and why.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Cooper| first1=Alan| last2=Reimann| first2=Robert| last3=Cronin| first3=David| last4=Noessel| first4=Christopher| title=About Face: The Essentials of Interaction Design| date=2 September 2014| publisher=Wiley| isbn=978-1-118-76657-6| page=62| edition=4th}}</ref> Once created, personas help the designer to understand the users' goals in specific contexts, which is particularly useful during ideation and for validating design concepts. Other types of models include work flow models, artifact models, and physical models.\n\n;Design\nWhen the designer has a firm grasp on the user's needs and goals, they begin to sketch out the interaction framework (also known as [[Website wireframe|wireframes]]). This stage defines the high-level structure of screen layouts, as well as the product's flow, behavior, and organization. There are many kinds of materials that can be involved during this iterative phase, from whiteboards to paper prototypes. As the interaction framework establishes an overall structure for product behavior, a parallel process focused on the visual and industrial designs. The visual design framework defines the experience attributes, visual language, and the visual style.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Cooper| first1=Alan| last2=Reimann| first2=Robert| last3=Cronin| first3=David| last4=Noessel| first4=Christopher| title=About Face: The Essentials of Interaction Design| date=2014| publisher=Wiley| isbn=978-1-118-76657-6| page=131| edition=4th}}</ref>\n\nOnce a solid and stable framework is established, wireframes are translated from sketched storyboards to full-resolution screens that depict the user interface at the pixel level. At this point, it's critical for the programming team to collaborate closely with the designer. Their input is necessary to creating a finished design that can and will be built while remaining true to the concept.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n \n;Test and iterate\nUsability testing is carried out by giving users various tasks to perform on the prototypes.

Information is communicated to the users through text and images. Much importance is given to how the text and images look and attract the users. Graphic designers have to make stylistic choices about things like font color, font type, and image locations. Graphic designers focus on grabbing the user's attention with the way the design looks. Graphic designers create visual concepts, using computer software or by hand, to communicate ideas that inspire, inform, and captivate consumers. They develop the overall layout and production design for various applications such as advertisements, brochures, magazines, and corporate reports.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm | title=Graphic Designers | publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor | work=Occupational Outlook Handbook | date=December 17, 2015 | accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Visual designers===\nThe visual designer (VisD) ensures that the visual representation of the design effectively communicates the data and hints at the expected behavior of the product.

This work overlaps with the work of both visual and industrial designers in a couple of important ways. When designing physical products, interaction designers must work with industrial designers early on to specify the requirements for physical inputs and to understand the behavioral impacts of the mechanisms behind them. Interaction designers cross paths with visual designers throughout the project. Visual designers guide the discussions of the brand and emotive aspects of the experience, Interaction designers communicate the priority of information, flow, and functionality in the interface.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cooper|first1=Alan|last2=Reimann|first2=Robert|last3=Cronin|first3=David|last4=Noessel|first4=Christopher|title=About Face: The Essentials of Interaction Design|date=2 September 2014|isbn=978-1-118-76657-6|page=153|edition=4th}}</ref>\n=== User experience in video games ===\nVideo games are run by user experience design tactics and are key in their success.

The basic idea behind conducting a usability test is to check whether the design of a product or brand works well with the target users. While carrying out usability testing, two things are being tested for: Whether the design of the product is successful and if it is not successful, how can it be improved. While designers are testing, they are testing the design and not the user. Also, every design is evolving.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} The designers carry out usability testing at every stage of the design process.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/usability-testing.html| title=Usability Testing| last=| first=| date=| website=usability.gov| publisher=| access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Action research]]\n* [[Activity-centered design]]\n* [[Customer experience]]\n* [[Design thinking]]\n* [[Paper prototyping]]\n* [[Participatory design]]\n* [[Process-centered design]]\n* [[User experience evaluation]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n<br>\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book | isbn = 9780123740373 | title = Sketching User Experiences: Getting the Design Right and the Right Design | last1 = Buxton | first1 = Bill | year = 2010| pages = 436 }}\n* {{cite book | isbn = 9780672316494 | title = The Inmates Are Running the Asylum: Why High-Tech Products Drive Us Crazy and How to Restore the Sanity | last1 = Cooper | first1 = Alan | year =1999  | pages = 261 }}\n* {{cite book | isbn = 9781118766576 | title = About Face: The Essentials of Interaction Design | last1 = Cooper | first1 = Alan | last2=Reimann |first2=Robert| last3=Cronin| first3=David| last4=Noessel| first4=Christopher| year = 2014 | edition=4th }}\n* {{cite book | isbn = 978-1940805375 | title = Mapping Methods 2: Step-by-step guide Experience Maps Journey Maps Service Blueprints Affinity Diagrams Empathy Maps Business Model Canvas | last1 = Curedale | first1 = Robert | year = 2018 | edition=2nd}}\n* {{cite book | isbn = 9780262134743 | title = Designing Interactions | last1 = Moggridge | first1 = Bill | year = 2006 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/designinginterac00mogg/page/766 766] | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/designinginterac00mogg/page/766 }}\n* {{cite book | isbn = 9783642133626 | title = User Experience Design: Mit erlebniszentrierter Softwareentwicklung zu Produkten, die begeistern | last1 = Moser | first1 = Christian | year = 2008  | pages = 252 }}\n* {{cite book | isbn = 9780465067107 | title = The Design of Everyday Things | last1 = Norman | first1 = Donald | title-link = The Design of Everyday Things | year = 2013| pages = 351 }}\n* {{cite book | isbn = 9781449379704 | title = Designing Interfaces | url = https://archive.org/details/designinginterfa00tidw | url-access = registration | last1 = Tidwell | first1 = Jenifer | year = 2005  | pages = 332 }}\n\n{{Design}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:User Experience Design}}\n[[Category:Human\u2013computer interaction]]\n[[Category:User interfaces]]\n[[Category:Design]]\n[[Category:Web design]]\n[[Category:Software development process]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Field of design focusing on the creation of user centered products and services}}\n{{More citations needed|date=March 2012}}\n'''User experience design''' ('''UXD''', '''UED''', or '''XD''') is the process of [[User behavior analytics|manipulating user behavior]]<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dsz5AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage|title=Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products|last=Eyal|first=Nir|date=2014-11-04|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9780698190665|language=en}}</ref> through [[usability]], usefulness, and [[desirability]] provided in the interaction with a product.<ref>{{ cite book | first = Aaron | last = Schmidt | author2 = Amanda Etches | title = Useful, Usable, Desirable: Applying User Experience Design | year = 2014 }}</ref> User experience design encompasses traditional [[human\u2013computer interaction]] (HCI) design and extends it by addressing all aspects of a product or service as perceived by users.

Other types of models include work flow models, artifact models, and physical models.\n\n;Design\nWhen the designer has a firm grasp on the user's needs and goals, they begin to sketch out the interaction framework (also known as [[Website wireframe|wireframes]]). This stage defines the high-level structure of screen layouts, as well as the product's flow, behavior, and organization. There are many kinds of materials that can be involved during this iterative phase, from whiteboards to paper prototypes. As the interaction framework establishes an overall structure for product behavior, a parallel process focused on the visual and industrial designs. The visual design framework defines the experience attributes, visual language, and the visual style.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Cooper| first1=Alan| last2=Reimann| first2=Robert| last3=Cronin| first3=David| last4=Noessel| first4=Christopher| title=About Face: The Essentials of Interaction Design| date=2014| publisher=Wiley| isbn=978-1-118-76657-6| page=131| edition=4th}}</ref>\n\nOnce a solid and stable framework is established, wireframes are translated from sketched storyboards to full-resolution screens that depict the user interface at the pixel level.

Information is communicated to the users through text and images. Much importance is given to how the text and images look and attract the users. Graphic designers have to make stylistic choices about things like font color, font type, and image locations. Graphic designers focus on grabbing the user's attention with the way the design looks. Graphic designers create visual concepts, using computer software or by hand, to communicate ideas that inspire, inform, and captivate consumers. They develop the overall layout and production design for various applications such as advertisements, brochures, magazines, and corporate reports.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm | title=Graphic Designers | publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor | work=Occupational Outlook Handbook | date=December 17, 2015 | accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Visual designers===\nThe visual designer (VisD) ensures that the visual representation of the design effectively communicates the data and hints at the expected behavior of the product.

This interaction means that the player becomes part of the story and not just an inactive participant.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.techtimes.com/articles/84016/20150914/how-video-games-have-become-the-perfect-storytelling-medium.htm|title=How Video Games Have Become The Perfect Storytelling Medium|last=Burks|first=Robin|date=2015-09-14|website=Tech Times|language=en|access-date=2019-12-14}}</ref> The quick decision making and on edge approach to video game storylines impact the way players shape their own user experience. In some circumstances, users could be faced with choosing life or death between two of their favorite characters. For players who become emotionally invested into their games this spices things up for them and leaves them with a tough decision.\n\n==Testing the design==\n{{Main||Usability testing}}\nUsability testing is the most common method used by designers to test their designs. The basic idea behind conducting a usability test is to check whether the design of a product or brand works well with the target users. While carrying out usability testing, two things are being tested for: Whether the design of the product is successful and if it is not successful, how can it be improved. While designers are testing, they are testing the design and not the user. Also, every design is evolving.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} The designers carry out usability testing at every stage of the design process.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/usability-testing.html| title=Usability Testing| last=| first=| date=| website=usability.gov| publisher=| access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Action research]]\n* [[Activity-centered design]]\n* [[Customer experience]]\n* [[Design thinking]]\n* [[Paper prototyping]]\n* [[Participatory design]]\n* [[Process-centered design]]\n* [[User experience evaluation]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n<br>\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book | isbn = 9780123740373 | title = Sketching User Experiences: Getting the Design Right and the Right Design | last1 = Buxton | first1 = Bill | year = 2010| pages = 436 }}\n* {{cite book | isbn = 9780672316494 | title = The Inmates Are Running the Asylum: Why High-Tech Products Drive Us Crazy and How to Restore the Sanity | last1 = Cooper | first1 = Alan | year =1999  | pages = 261 }}\n* {{cite book | isbn = 9781118766576 | title = About Face: The Essentials of Interaction Design | last1 = Cooper | first1 = Alan | last2=Reimann |first2=Robert| last3=Cronin| first3=David| last4=Noessel| first4=Christopher| year = 2014 | edition=4th }}\n* {{cite book | isbn = 978-1940805375 | title = Mapping Methods 2: Step-by-step guide Experience Maps Journey Maps Service Blueprints Affinity Diagrams Empathy Maps Business Model Canvas | last1 = Curedale | first1 = Robert | year = 2018 | edition=2nd}}\n* {{cite book | isbn = 9780262134743 | title = Designing Interactions | last1 = Moggridge | first1 = Bill | year = 2006 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/designinginterac00mogg/page/766 766] | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/designinginterac00mogg/page/766 }}\n* {{cite book | isbn = 9783642133626 | title = User Experience Design: Mit erlebniszentrierter Softwareentwicklung zu Produkten, die begeistern | last1 = Moser | first1 = Christian | year = 2008  | pages = 252 }}\n* {{cite book | isbn = 9780465067107 | title = The Design of Everyday Things | last1 = Norman | first1 = Donald | title-link = The Design of Everyday Things | year = 2013| pages = 351 }}\n* {{cite book | isbn = 9781449379704 | title = Designing Interfaces | url = https://archive.org/details/designinginterfa00tidw | url-access = registration | last1 = Tidwell | first1 = Jenifer | year = 2005  | pages = 332 }}\n\n{{Design}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:User Experience Design}}\n[[Category:Human\u2013computer interaction]]\n[[Category:User interfaces]]\n[[Category:Design]]\n[[Category:Web design]]\n[[Category:Software development process]]\n", "name_user": "137.97.86.10", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eWCAG compliance)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design"}

He is also well known for his portrayal of Rev. [[Charlie Andrews]] in the 1982 Oscar-winning film ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]''.\n\nCharleson was a noted actor on the British stage as well, with critically acclaimed leads in ''[[Guys and Dolls]]'', ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]'', ''[[Fool for Love (play)|Fool for Love]]'', and ''[[Hamlet]]'', among many others. He performed numerous [[Shakespeare]]an roles, and in 1991 the annual [[Ian Charleson Awards]] were established, particularly in honour of his final Hamlet.<ref name=rosenthal>Rosenthal, Daniel.

He made his professional stage debut in 1972 with the Young Vic, as one of the brothers in ''[[Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat]]'' (1972), which was also televised in the UK that same year by [[Granada Television]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1666317 ''Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat'' (TV, 1972)] at the [[Internet Movie Database]].</ref> In 1973, he starred as Jimmy Porter in ''[[Look Back in Anger]]'', and that year he was also Hamlet and later Guildenstern in the first revival of Tom  Stoppard's ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]]''.  Also as part of the Young Vic company, Charleson was Claudio in ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' in 1974. He traveled with the company to the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] in New York that same year, to appear as Lucentio in ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'', Ottavio in ''[[Les Fourberies de Scapin|Scapino]]'', and Brian Curtis in ''[[French Without Tears]]''.\n\nIn 1975, he played the title role in ''[[Hamlet]]'' in a [[Cambridge Theatre Company]] touring production. The performance garnered good reviews; nevertheless Charleson felt he had not done the notoriously difficult role complete justice.\n\n===West End and National Theatre debuts, Royal Shakespeare Company===\nCharleson made his [[West End theatre|West End]] debut in 1975, in a long-running production of Simon Gray's ''[[Otherwise Engaged]]'' at the [[Queen's Theatre]]. In it he played Dave, a surly Scottish lodger, opposite [[Alan Bates]].\n\nHe next appeared at the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]], where he performed Octavius in ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''  in 1977. That year he also played Peregrine in the classic play ''[[Volpone]]'', opposite [[John Gielgud]], and [[Captain Phoebus]] in ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]''.\n\nCharleson then spent a year in Stratford-upon-Avon with the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] 1978\u201379.

Also with the RSC, he was Lawrence Vail in an acclaimed production of ''[[Once in a Lifetime (play)|Once in a Lifetime]]'' (1979) at the Aldwych Theatre, and he played Pierre in the [[Jane Lapotaire]] vehicle ''[[Piaf (play)|Piaf]]'', giving a performance which caught the eye of the filmmakers of ''[[Chariots of Fire]]''.\n\n===National Theatre spotlight===\n[[File:National Theatre, London.jpg|thumb|280px|At the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]], Charleson appeared in ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', ''[[Volpone]]'', and ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]''.

He was a glowingly reviewed Sky Masterson in [[Richard Eyre]]'s enormously successful revival of the musical ''[[Guys and Dolls (musical)|Guys and Dolls]]'' (1982), opposite [[Julie Covington]] as Sister Sarah, with [[Bob Hoskins]] as Nathan Detroit and [[Julia McKenzie]] as Adelaide.\n\nCharleson received an [[Olivier Award]] nomination for [[Laurence Olivier Award for Actor of the Year in a New Play|Actor of the Year in a New Play]] as Eddie in [[Sam Shepard]]'s gritty and very physical two-person drama, ''[[Fool for Love (play)|Fool for Love]]'' (1984\u201385), opposite [[Julie Walters]] as his on-again off-again love object. And he was a highly praised Brick, the repressed homosexual protagonist in Tennessee Williams' ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]'' (1988), opposite [[Lindsay Duncan]].\n\n===Final Hamlet===\nShortly before his death, while seriously ill from AIDS, from 9 October to 13 November 1989 Charleson performed his second run of ''[[Hamlet]]'', this time at the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] \u2013 giving a definitive performance which garnered major accolades.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=lZDCequ4E4kC&pg=PA170&vq=%22The+Readiness+Was+All%22&ie=ISO-8859-1&output=html&source=gbs_search_r&cad=1 \"The Readiness Was All: Ian Charleson and Richard Eyre's ''Hamlet''\"],  by Richard Allan Davison.

They then saw Charleson performing the role of Pierre in ''[[Piaf (play)|Piaf]]'', and knew immediately they had found their man.

He changed his study concentration accordingly, and graduated with a degree in English, fine art, and mathematics.<ref name=\"Alumni Administrator\">Data from Alumni Administrator, Edinburgh University.</ref> In addition to his acting roles at Edinburgh University, Charleson also directed many plays there, and he designed costumes for several as well.\n\nFrom 1967 through 1973, Charleson also performed often at the [[Edinburgh Festival]] and [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]], becoming a noted actor in those circles.<ref>McKellen, Bates, Hudson, et al. p. xvi: \"He became, according to the ''[[Edinburgh Evening News]]'', 'a well-known figure in fringe circles.'\"</ref>\n\n==Stage career==\n\n===LAMDA, Young Vic, and Cambridge Theatre Company===\nAfter graduating from the University of Edinburgh \u2013 where he played leads in dozens of productions, including numerous Shakespeare plays<ref>Charleson's roles with the Edinburgh University Dramatic Society included, among others: Malvolio in\n''[[Twelfth Night]]''; Gaveston in ''[[Edward II (play)|Edward II]]''; John Worthing in ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]''; Dr. Prentice\nin ''[[What the Butler Saw (play)|What the Butler Saw]]''; Callimaco in ''[[The Mandrake|Mandrake, the Musical]]''; Tony Lumpkin in ''[[She Stoops to Conquer]]''; the Herald in ''[[Marat/Sade]]''.</ref> \u2013 Charleson won a place in the [[London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art]] (LAMDA), where he studied for two years.\n\nFrom LAMDA, Charleson was hired by [[Frank Dunlop (director)|Frank Dunlop]]'s [[Young Vic|Young Vic Theatre Company]].  He made his professional stage debut in 1972 with the Young Vic, as one of the brothers in ''[[Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat]]'' (1972), which was also televised in the UK that same year by [[Granada Television]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1666317 ''Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat'' (TV, 1972)] at the [[Internet Movie Database]].</ref> In 1973, he starred as Jimmy Porter in ''[[Look Back in Anger]]'', and that year he was also Hamlet and later Guildenstern in the first revival of Tom  Stoppard's ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]]''.  Also as part of the Young Vic company, Charleson was Claudio in ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' in 1974. He traveled with the company to the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] in New York that same year, to appear as Lucentio in ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'', Ottavio in ''[[Les Fourberies de Scapin|Scapino]]'', and Brian Curtis in ''[[French Without Tears]]''.\n\nIn 1975, he played the title role in ''[[Hamlet]]'' in a [[Cambridge Theatre Company]] touring production. The performance garnered good reviews; nevertheless Charleson felt he had not done the notoriously difficult role complete justice.\n\n===West End and National Theatre debuts, Royal Shakespeare Company===\nCharleson made his [[West End theatre|West End]] debut in 1975, in a long-running production of Simon Gray's ''[[Otherwise Engaged]]'' at the [[Queen's Theatre]]. In it he played Dave, a surly Scottish lodger, opposite [[Alan Bates]].\n\nHe next appeared at the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]], where he performed Octavius in ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''  in 1977. That year he also played Peregrine in the classic play ''[[Volpone]]'', opposite [[John Gielgud]], and [[Captain Phoebus]] in ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]''.\n\nCharleson then spent a year in Stratford-upon-Avon with the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] 1978\u201379. There he performed a hauntingly voiced Ariel in ''[[The Tempest]]''; Tranio in ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]''; and Longaville in ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'' opposite [[Richard Griffiths]] as the King \u2013 all both in Stratford and at the [[Aldwych Theatre]] in London. Also with the RSC, he was Lawrence Vail in an acclaimed production of ''[[Once in a Lifetime (play)|Once in a Lifetime]]'' (1979) at the Aldwych Theatre, and he played Pierre in the [[Jane Lapotaire]] vehicle ''[[Piaf (play)|Piaf]]'', giving a performance which caught the eye of the filmmakers of ''[[Chariots of Fire]]''.\n\n===National Theatre spotlight===\n[[File:National Theatre, London.jpg|thumb|280px|At the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]], Charleson appeared in ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', ''[[Volpone]]'', and ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]''. His acclaimed starring roles there were in ''[[Guys and Dolls (musical)|Guys and Dolls]]'', ''[[Fool for Love (play)|Fool for Love]]'', ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]'', and ''[[Hamlet]]''.]]\nIn the 1980s, Charleson won particular critical and popular acclaim for his starring roles at the National Theatre. He was a glowingly reviewed Sky Masterson in [[Richard Eyre]]'s enormously successful revival of the musical ''[[Guys and Dolls (musical)|Guys and Dolls]]'' (1982), opposite [[Julie Covington]] as Sister Sarah, with [[Bob Hoskins]] as Nathan Detroit and [[Julia McKenzie]] as Adelaide.\n\nCharleson received an [[Olivier Award]] nomination for [[Laurence Olivier Award for Actor of the Year in a New Play|Actor of the Year in a New Play]] as Eddie in [[Sam Shepard]]'s gritty and very physical two-person drama, ''[[Fool for Love (play)|Fool for Love]]'' (1984\u201385), opposite [[Julie Walters]] as his on-again off-again love object. And he was a highly praised Brick, the repressed homosexual protagonist in Tennessee Williams' ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]'' (1988), opposite [[Lindsay Duncan]].\n\n===Final Hamlet===\nShortly before his death, while seriously ill from AIDS, from 9 October to 13 November 1989 Charleson performed his second run of ''[[Hamlet]]'', this time at the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] \u2013 giving a definitive performance which garnered major accolades.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=lZDCequ4E4kC&pg=PA170&vq=%22The+Readiness+Was+All%22&ie=ISO-8859-1&output=html&source=gbs_search_r&cad=1 \"The Readiness Was All: Ian Charleson and Richard Eyre's ''Hamlet''\"],  by Richard Allan Davison.

They then saw Charleson performing the role of Pierre in ''[[Piaf (play)|Piaf]]'', and knew immediately they had found their man. Unbeknownst to them, Charleson had heard about the film from his father, and desperately wanted to play the part, feeling it would \"fit like a kid glove\".<ref>Ian McKellen, Hugh Hudson, Alan Bates, et al. For Ian Charleson: A Tribute. London: Constable and Company, 1990. pp. xix, 9, 76.</ref> This mutual affinity led to Charleson's best-known film role and success \u2013 as the athlete and missionary Eric Liddell in ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'' (1981). Charleson prepared for the role by studying the Bible intensively, and he himself wrote Liddell's stirring post-race address to the workingmen's crowd.<ref>McKellen, Bates, Hudson, et al. pp. 37\u201339.</ref> This film and role made him an international celebrity.<ref>[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/562087/index.html \"Charleson, Ian (1949-1990)\"].

Like ''Chariots of Fire'', the film ''Gandhi'' won numerous [[Academy Award]]s, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].\n\n===Other film work===\nAfter these two major successes in these two Best Picture Oscar\u2013winning films, Charleson's film career did not, however, follow the same progressive arc that his stage career did.

He died eight weeks after performing the title role in a run of ''[[Hamlet]]'', in [[Richard Eyre|Richard Eyre's]] production at the [[Royal National Theatre|Olivier Theatre]].

The county and [[Cumbria County Council]], its [[local government]], came into existence in 1974 after the passage of the [[Local Government Act 1972]]. Cumbria's [[county town]] is [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], in the north of the county, and the only other major urban area is [[Barrow-in-Furness]] on the southwestern tip of the county.\n\nThe county of Cumbria consists of six [[Districts of England|districts]] ([[Allerdale]], [[Borough of Barrow-in-Furness|Barrow-in-Furness]], [[City of Carlisle|Carlisle]], [[Borough of Copeland|Copeland]], [[Eden District|Eden]], and [[South Lakeland]]) and in 2008 had a population of just under 500,000 people. Cumbria is one of the most sparsely populated counties in England, with 73.4 people per km<sup>2</sup> (190/sq mi).\n\nCumbria is the second largest county in England by area, and is bounded to the north by the [[Subdivisions of Scotland|Scottish council area]]s of [[Dumfries and Galloway]] and [[Scottish Borders]], to the west by the [[Irish Sea]], to the south by [[Lancashire]], to the southeast by [[North Yorkshire]], and to the east by [[County Durham]] and [[Northumberland]].\n\nCumbria is predominantly rural and contains the [[Lake District]] [[National parks of England and Wales|National Park]], a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] considered one of England's finest areas of natural beauty, serving as inspiration for artists, writers, and musicians. A large area of the southeast of the county is within the [[Yorkshire Dales National Park]] while the east of the county fringes the [[North Pennines]] [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty|AONB]]. Much of Cumbria is mountainous, and it contains every peak in England over {{convert|3000|ft|m}} above sea level, with [[Scafell Pike]] at {{convert|3209|ft|m}} being the highest point of England. An upland, coastal, and rural area, Cumbria's history is characterised by invasions, migration, and settlement, as well as battles and skirmishes between the English and the Scots. Notable historic sites in Cumbria include [[Carlisle Castle]], [[Furness Abbey]], [[Hardknott Roman Fort]], [[Brough Castle]] and [[Hadrian's Wall]] (also a [[World Heritage Site]]).\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Cumbria}}\n[[File:Castlerigg2.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Castlerigg stone circle]] dates from the late [[Neolithic|Neolithic age]] and was constructed by some of the earliest inhabitants of Cumbria]]\n\nThe county of Cumbria was created in April 1974 through an amalgamation of the [[Administrative counties of England|administrative counties]] of [[Cumberland]] and [[Westmorland]], to which parts of [[Lancashire]] (the area known as [[Furness|Lancashire North of the Sands]]) and the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]] were added.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1972/70/schedule/1|title=Local Government Act 1972|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|access-date=2018-08-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180701222339/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1972/70/schedule/1|archive-date=1 July 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Neolithic]] period the area contained an important centre of stone axe production (the so-called [[Langdale axe industry|'Langdale Axe Factory']]), products of which have been found across Great Britain.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-wYOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA60&dq=Langdale+axe+industry#v=onepage&q=Langdale%20axe%20industry&f=false|title=Neolithic Britain: New Stone Age Sites of England, Scotland, and Wales|last=Castleden|first=Rodney|date=1992|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415058452|access-date=20 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180820172803/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-wYOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA60&dq=Langdale+axe+industry&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Langdale%20axe%20industry&f=false|archive-date=20 August 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> During this period [[stone circles]] and [[henges]] were built across the county and today 'Cumbria has one of the largest number of preserved field monuments in England'.<ref>Barrowclough (2010), p. 105.</ref>\n\nWhile not part of the region conquered in the [[Roman conquest of Britain|Romans' initial conquest of Britain]] in AD 43, most of modern-day Cumbria was later conquered in response to a revolt deposing the Roman-aligned ruler of the [[Brigantes]] in AD 69.<ref>Shotter (2014), p.5</ref> The Romans built a number of fortifications in the area during their occupation, the most famous being [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] [[Hadrian's Wall]] which passes through northern Cumbria.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/430|title=Frontiers of the Roman Empire|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|access-date=2018-08-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180820203449/https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/430|archive-date=20 August 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAt the end of the period of British history known as [[Roman Britain]] ({{circa|AD 410}}) the inhabitants of Cumbria were [[Cumbric]]-speaking native [[Romano-British culture|Romano-Britons]] who were probably descendants of the [[Brigantes]] and [[Carvetii]] (sometimes considered to be a sub-tribe of the Brigantes) that the [[Roman Empire]] had conquered in about AD 85.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Based on inscriptional evidence from the area, the Roman ''{{lang|la|[[civitas]]}}'' of the Carvetii seems to have covered portions of Cumbria.

Other publications, such as local government promotional material, describe the area as \"Cumbria\", as do the [[Lake District]] National Park Authority and most visitors.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Cumbria SRTM.png|thumb|left|Topographic map of Cumbria]]\nCumbria is the most northwesterly county of England. The northernmost and southernmost points in Cumbria are just west of [[Deadwater, Northumberland]] and [[Walney Island|South Walney]] respectively. [[Kirkby Stephen]] (close to [[Tan Hill, North Yorkshire]]) and [[St Bees Head]] are the most easterly and westerly points of the county. Most of Cumbria is mountainous, with the majority of the county being situated in the Lake District while the [[Pennines]], consisting of the Yorkshire Dales and the North Pennines, lie at the eastern and south-east areas of the county. At {{convert|978|m|ft|0}} [[Scafell Pike]] is the highest point in Cumbria and in England. [[Windermere]] is the largest natural lake in England.\n\nThe [[Lancaster Canal]] runs from Preston into South Cumbria and is partly in use. The [[Ulverston Canal]] which once reached to [[Morecambe Bay]] is maintained although it was closed in 1945. The [[Solway Coast]] and [[Arnside and Silverdale]] [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty|AONB's]] lie in the lowland areas of the county, to the north and south respectively.\n\n===Boundaries and divisions===\nCumbria is bordered by the English counties of [[Northumberland]], [[County Durham]], [[North Yorkshire]], [[Lancashire]], and the [[Scotland|Scottish]] council areas of [[Dumfries and Galloway]] and [[Scottish Borders]].\n\nThe boundaries are along the [[Irish Sea]] to [[Morecambe Bay]] in the west, and along the [[Pennines]] to the east. Cumbria's northern boundary stretches from the [[Solway Firth]] from the [[Solway Plain]] eastward along the border with [[Scotland]] to [[Northumberland]].\n\nIt is made up of six [[Districts of England|districts]]: Allerdale, Barrow-in-Furness, Carlisle, Copeland, Eden and South Lakeland. For many administrative purposes Cumbria is divided into three areas&nbsp;\u2014 East, West and South. East consists of the districts of Carlisle and Eden, West&nbsp;consists of Allerdale and Copeland, and South consists of Lakeland and Barrow.\n\nIn January 2007, Cumbria County Council voted in favour of an official bid to scrap the current two-tier system of county and district councils in favour of a new [[Unitary authority|unitary]] Cumbria Council, to be submitted for consideration to the [[Department for Communities and Local Government]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cumbria.gov.uk/news/Archive/2007/january/18_01_2007-131242.asp | title=County council votes to pursue a single council for Cumbria | accessdate=24 February 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224110254/http://www.cumbria.gov.uk/news/Archive/2007/january/18_01_2007-131242.asp | archive-date=24 December 2013 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref> This was then rejected.\n\nThe county returns six Members of Parliament to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], representing the constituencies of [[Carlisle (UK Parliament constituency)|Carlisle]], [[Penrith and The Border (UK Parliament constituency)|Penrith & The Border]], [[Workington (UK Parliament constituency)|Workington]], [[Copeland (UK Parliament constituency)|Copeland]], [[Westmorland and Lonsdale (UK Parliament constituency)|Westmorland and Lonsdale]] and [[Barrow and Furness (UK Parliament constituency)|Barrow & Furness]].\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:DDH, Barrow-in-Furness.jpg|thumb|right|[[BAE Systems Submarine Solutions]] in Barrow-in-Furness has a workforce of around 5,000 people.]]\nMany large companies and organisations are based in Cumbria.

There are 42 state secondary schools and 10 independent schools. The more rural secondary schools tend to have [[sixth form]]s (although in Barrow-in-Furness district, no schools have sixth forms) and this is the same for three schools in Allerdale and South Lakeland, and one in the other districts. Chetwynde is also the only school in Barrow to educate children from nursery all the way to sixth form level.\n\nColleges of further education in Cumbria include:-\n*  [[Carlisle College]], \n*  [[Furness College, Barrow-in-Furness|Furness College]] which includes [[Barrow Sixth Form College]], \n*  [[Kendal College]],\n*  [[Lakes College West Cumbria]].\n\nThe [[University of Cumbria]] is one of the UK's newest universities having been established in 2007, it is at present the only university in Cumbria and has campuses across the county, together with [[Lancaster University|Lancaster]] and [[London]].\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Lune Valley from Grayrigg Forest.jpg|thumb|right|The [[M6 motorway]] and [[West Coast Main Line]] near [[Grayrigg Forest]]]]\n\nThe [[M6 motorway|M6]] is the only motorway that runs through Cumbria. [[Kendal]] and [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]] are amongst its primary destinations before it becomes the [[A74(M)]] just north of [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]]. Major [[A roads in Great Britain|A roads]] within Cumbria include:\n\n* [[A6 road (England)|A6]] (Luton, Bedfordshire to Carlisle via Kendal and Penrith)\n* [[A66 road|A66]] (Workington to Middlesbrough, North Yorkshire via Keswick, Penrith and Brough)\n* [[A69 road|A69]] (Carlisle to Newcastle upon Tyne via Brampton and Hexham)\n* [[A590 road|A590]] (M6 Junction 36 to Barrow-in-Furness via Ulverston)\n* [[A591 road|A591]] (Sizergh to Bothel via Kendal, Windermere, Ambleside, Grasmere and Keswick)\n* [[A592 road|A592]] (M6 Junction 40 to Newby Bridge via Penrith, Windermere and Bowness-on-Windermere)\n* [[A595 road|A595]] (Carlisle to Dalton-in-Furness via Whitehaven and Workington)\n* [[A596 road|A596]] (Carlisle to Workington)\n\nSeveral bus companies run services in Cumbria serving the main towns and villages in the county, with some services running to neighbouring areas such as [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]]. [[Stagecoach North West]] is the largest; it has depots in Barrow-in-Furness, Carlisle, Kendal and Workington. Stagecoach's flagship X6 route connects Barrow-in-Furness and Kendal in south Cumbria.\n\nThere are only two airports in the county: [[Carlisle Lake District Airport|Carlisle Lake District]] and [[Barrow/Walney Island Airport|Barrow/Walney Island]]. Both airports formerly served scheduled passenger flights and both are proposing expansions and renovations to handle domestic and European flights in the near future. The nearest international airports to south Cumbria are [[Blackpool International Airport|Blackpool]], [[Manchester Airport|Manchester]] and [[Liverpool Airport|Liverpool John Lennon]]. North Cumbria is closer to [[Newcastle International Airport|Newcastle]], [[Glasgow Prestwick Airport|Glasgow Prestwick]] and [[Glasgow International Airport|Glasgow International]]. Barrow-in-Furness is one of the country's largest shipbuilding centres, but the [[Port of Barrow]] is only minor, operated by [[Associated British Ports]] alongside the Port of [[Silloth]] in Allerdale. There are no ferry links from any port or harbour along the Cumbria coast.\n\nThe busiest railway stations in Cumbria are [[Carlisle railway station|Carlisle]], [[Barrow-in-Furness railway station|Barrow-in-Furness]], [[Penrith railway station|Penrith]] and [[Oxenholme Lake District railway station|Oxenholme Lake District]]. The [[West Coast Main Line]] runs for {{convert|399|mi|km}} through the Cumbria countryside adjacent to the M6 motorway. The [[Cumbrian Coast Line]] connects Barrow-in-Furness to Carlisle and is a vital link in the west of the county. Other railways in Cumbria are the [[Windermere Branch Line]], most of the [[Furness Line]] and much of the [[Settle-Carlisle Railway]].\n\n==Demography==\n{{Location map+|Cumbria\n |caption=<center>The largest settlements in Cumbria</center>\n |float=right\n |width=350\n |places =\n  <!-- First two have population over 50,000 according to their articles, listed in descending order-->\n  {{Location map~|Cumbria|lat=54.8910|long=-2.9439|label='''[[Carlisle]]'''|label_size=100|marksize=12}}\n  {{Location map~|Cumbria|lat=54.1108|long=-3.2261|label='''[[Barrow-in-Furness]]'''|label_size=100|marksize=12}}\n  <!-- Below all have population over 20,000 according to their articles, listed in descending order-->\n  {{Location map~|Cumbria|lat=54.3260|long=-2.7450|label=[[Kendal]]|label_size=85}}\n  {{Location map~|Cumbria|lat=54.5480|long=-3.5855|label=[[Whitehaven]]|label_size=85}}\n  {{Location map~|Cumbria|lat=54.6365|long=-3.5549|label=[[Workington]]|label_size=85}}\n  <!-- Below all have population over 10,000 according to their articles, listed in descending order-->\n  {{Location map~|Cumbria|lat=54.6648|long=-2.7548|label=[[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]]|label_size=70}}\n  {{Location map~|Cumbria|lat=54.7128|long=-3.4926|label=[[Maryport]]|label_size=70}}\n  {{Location map~|Cumbria|lat=54.1931|long=-3.0906|label=[[Ulverston]]|label_size=70}}\n }}\n{{Main|Demography of Cumbria}}\n\nCumbria's largest settlement and only city is [[Carlisle]], in the north of the county. The largest town, [[Barrow-in-Furness]], in the south, is slightly smaller. The county's population is largely rural: it has the second-lowest population density among English counties, and has only five towns with a population of over 20,000. Cumbria is also one of the country's most ethnically homogeneous counties, with 95.1% of the population categorised as [[White British]] (around 470,900 of the 495,000 Cumbrians).<ref name=\"2009ethnicity\">{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_population/lad-tables-2009.xls |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810102910/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_population/lad-tables-2009.xls |archivedate=10 August 2011 | title=Current Estimates \u2013 Population Estimates by Ethnic Group Mid-2009 (experimental) | publisher=[[Office for National Statistics]] | accessdate=20 May 2011}}</ref> However, the larger towns have ethnic makeups that are closer to the national average.

The county and [[Cumbria County Council]], its [[local government]], came into existence in 1974 after the passage of the [[Local Government Act 1972]]. Cumbria's [[county town]] is [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], in the north of the county, and the only other major urban area is [[Barrow-in-Furness]] on the southwestern tip of the county.\n\nThe county of Cumbria consists of six [[Districts of England|districts]] ([[Allerdale]], [[Borough of Barrow-in-Furness|Barrow-in-Furness]], [[City of Carlisle|Carlisle]], [[Borough of Copeland|Copeland]], [[Eden District|Eden]], and [[South Lakeland]]) and in 2008 had a population of just under 500,000 people. Cumbria is one of the most sparsely populated counties in England, with 73.4 people per km<sup>2</sup> (190/sq mi).\n\nCumbria is the second largest county in England by area, and is bounded to the north by the [[Subdivisions of Scotland|Scottish council area]]s of [[Dumfries and Galloway]] and [[Scottish Borders]], to the west by the [[Irish Sea]], to the south by [[Lancashire]], to the southeast by [[North Yorkshire]], and to the east by [[County Durham]] and [[Northumberland]].\n\nCumbria is predominantly rural and contains the [[Lake District]] [[National parks of England and Wales|National Park]], a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] considered one of England's finest areas of natural beauty, serving as inspiration for artists, writers, and musicians. A large area of the southeast of the county is within the [[Yorkshire Dales National Park]] while the east of the county fringes the [[North Pennines]] [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty|AONB]]. Much of Cumbria is mountainous, and it contains every peak in England over {{convert|3000|ft|m}} above sea level, with [[Scafell Pike]] at {{convert|3209|ft|m}} being the highest point of England. An upland, coastal, and rural area, Cumbria's history is characterised by invasions, migration, and settlement, as well as battles and skirmishes between the English and the Scots. Notable historic sites in Cumbria include [[Carlisle Castle]], [[Furness Abbey]], [[Hardknott Roman Fort]], [[Brough Castle]] and [[Hadrian's Wall]] (also a [[World Heritage Site]]).\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Cumbria}}\n[[File:Castlerigg2.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Castlerigg stone circle]] dates from the late [[Neolithic|Neolithic age]] and was constructed by some of the earliest inhabitants of Cumbria]]\n\nThe county of Cumbria was created in April 1974 through an amalgamation of the [[Administrative counties of England|administrative counties]] of [[Cumberland]] and [[Westmorland]], to which parts of [[Lancashire]] (the area known as [[Furness|Lancashire North of the Sands]]) and the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]] were added.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1972/70/schedule/1|title=Local Government Act 1972|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|access-date=2018-08-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180701222339/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1972/70/schedule/1|archive-date=1 July 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Neolithic]] period the area contained an important centre of stone axe production (the so called [[Langdale axe industry|'Langdale Axe Factory']]), products of which have been found across Great Britain.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?i d=-wYOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA60&dq=Langdale+axe+industry#v=onepage&q=Langdale%20axe%20industry&f=false|title=Neolithic Britain: New Stone Age Sites of England, Scotland, and Wales|last=Castleden|first=Rodney|date=1992|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415058452|access-date=20 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180820172803/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-wYOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA60&dq=Langdale+axe+industry&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Langdale%20axe%20industry&f=false|archive-date=20 August 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> During this period [[stone circles]] and [[henges]] were built across the county and today 'Cumbria has one of the largest number of preserved field monuments in England'.<ref>Barrowclough (2010), p. 105.</ref>\n\nWhile not part of the region conquered in the [[Roman conquest of Britain|Romans' initial conquest of Britain]] in AD 43, most of modern-day Cumbria was later conquered in response to a revolt deposing the Roman-aligned ruler of the [[Brigantes]] in AD 69.<ref>Shotter (2014), p.5</ref> The Romans built a number of fortifications in the area during their occupation, the most famous being [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] [[Hadrian's Wall]] which passes through northern Cumbria.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/430|title=Frontiers of the Roman Empire|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|access-date=2018-08-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180820203449/https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/430|archive-date=20 August 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAt the end of the period of British history known as [[Roman Britain]] ({{circa|AD 410}}) the inhabitants of Cumbria were [[Cumbric]]-speaking native [[Romano-British culture|Romano-Britons]] who were probably descendants of the [[Brigantes]] and [[Carvetii]] (sometimes considered to be a sub-tribe of the Brigantes) that the [[Roman Empire]] had conquered in about AD 85.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Based on inscriptional evidence from the area, the Roman ''{{lang|la|[[civitas]]}}'' of the Carvetii seems to have covered portions of Cumbria.

The northernmost and southernmost points in Cumbria are just west of [[Deadwater, Northumberland]] and [[Walney Island|South Walney]] respectively. [[Kirkby Stephen]] (close to [[Tan Hill, North Yorkshire]]) and [[St Bees Head]] are the most easterly and westerly points of the county. Most of Cumbria is mountainous, with the majority of the county being situated in the Lake District while the [[Pennines]], consisting of the Yorkshire Dales and the North Pennines, lie at the eastern and south-east areas of the county. At {{convert|978|m|ft|0}} [[Scafell Pike]] is the highest point in Cumbria and in England. [[Windermere]] is the largest natural lake in England.\n\nThe [[Lancaster Canal]] runs from Preston into South Cumbria and is partly in use. The [[Ulverston Canal]] which once reached to [[Morecambe Bay]] is maintained although it was closed in 1945. The [[Solway Coast]] and [[Arnside and Silverdale]] [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty|AONB's]] lie in the lowland areas of the county, to the north and south respectively.\n\n===Boundaries and divisions===\nCumbria is bordered by the English counties of [[Northumberland]], [[County Durham]], [[North Yorkshire]], [[Lancashire]], and the [[Scotland|Scottish]] council areas of [[Dumfries and Galloway]] and [[Scottish Borders]].\n\nThe boundaries are along the [[Irish Sea]] to [[Morecambe Bay]] in the west, and along the [[Pennines]] to the east. Cumbria's northern boundary stretches from the [[Solway Firth]] from the [[Solway Plain]] eastward along the border with [[Scotland]] to [[Northumberland]].\n\nIt is made up of six [[Districts of England|districts]]: Allerdale, Barrow-in-Furness, Carlisle, Copeland, Eden and South Lakeland. For many administrative purposes Cumbria is divided into three areas&nbsp;\u2014 East, West and South.

There are 42 state secondary schools and 10 independent schools. The more rural secondary schools tend to have [[sixth form]]s (although in Barrow-in-Furness district, no schools have sixth forms) and this is the same for three schools in Allerdale and South Lakeland, and one in the other districts. Chetwynde is also the only school in Barrow to educate children from nursery all the way to sixth form level.\n\nColleges of further education in Cumbria include:-\n*  [[Carlisle College]], \n*  [[Furness College, Barrow-in-Furness|Furness College]] which includes [[Barrow Sixth Form College]], \n*  [[Kendal College]],\n*  [[Lakes College West Cumbria]].\n\nThe [[University of Cumbria]] is one of the UK's newest universities having been established in 2007, it is at present the only university in Cumbria and has campuses across the county, together with [[Lancaster University|Lancaster]] and [[London]].\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Lune Valley from Grayrigg Forest.jpg|thumb|right|The [[M6 motorway]] and [[West Coast Main Line]] near [[Grayrigg Forest]]]]\n\nThe [[M6 motorway|M6]] is the only motorway that runs through Cumbria. [[Kendal]] and [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]] are amongst its primary destinations before it becomes the [[A74(M)]] just north of [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]]. Major [[A roads in Great Britain|A roads]] within Cumbria include:\n\n* [[A6 road (England)|A6]] (Luton, Bedfordshire to Carlisle via Kendal and Penrith)\n* [[A66 road|A66]] (Workington to Middlesbrough, North Yorkshire via Keswick, Penrith and Brough)\n* [[A69 road|A69]] (Carlisle to Newcastle upon Tyne via Brampton and Hexham)\n* [[A590 road|A590]] (M6 Junction 36 to Barrow-in-Furness via Ulverston)\n* [[A591 road|A591]] (Sizergh to Bothel via Kendal, Windermere, Ambleside, Grasmere and Keswick)\n* [[A592 road|A592]] (M6 Junction 40 to Newby Bridge via Penrith, Windermere and Bowness-on-Windermere)\n* [[A595 road|A595]] (Carlisle to Dalton-in-Furness via Whitehaven and Workington)\n* [[A596 road|A596]] (Carlisle to Workington)\n\nSeveral bus companies run services in Cumbria serving the main towns and villages in the county, with some services running to neighbouring areas such as [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]]. [[Stagecoach North West]] is the largest; it has depots in Barrow-in-Furness, Carlisle, Kendal and Workington. Stagecoach's flagship X6 route connects Barrow-in-Furness and Kendal in south Cumbria.\n\nThere are only two airports in the county: [[Carlisle Lake District Airport|Carlisle Lake District]] and [[Barrow/Walney Island Airport|Barrow/Walney Island]]. Both airports formerly served scheduled passenger flights and both are proposing expansions and renovations to handle domestic and European flights in the near future. The nearest international airports to south Cumbria are [[Blackpool International Airport|Blackpool]], [[Manchester Airport|Manchester]] and [[Liverpool Airport|Liverpool John Lennon]]. North Cumbria is closer to [[Newcastle International Airport|Newcastle]], [[Glasgow Prestwick Airport|Glasgow Prestwick]] and [[Glasgow International Airport|Glasgow International]]. Barrow-in-Furness is one of the country's largest shipbuilding centres, but the [[Port of Barrow]] is only minor, operated by [[Associated British Ports]] alongside the Port of [[Silloth]] in Allerdale. There are no ferry links from any port or harbour along the Cumbria coast.\n\nThe busiest railway stations in Cumbria are [[Carlisle railway station|Carlisle]], [[Barrow-in-Furness railway station|Barrow-in-Furness]], [[Penrith railway station|Penrith]] and [[Oxenholme Lake District railway station|Oxenholme Lake District]]. The [[West Coast Main Line]] runs for {{convert|399|mi|km}} through the Cumbria countryside adjacent to the M6 motorway. The [[Cumbrian Coast Line]] connects Barrow-in-Furness to Carlisle and is a vital link in the west of the county.

The largest town, [[Barrow-in-Furness]], in the south, is slightly smaller. The county's population is largely rural: it has the second-lowest population density among English counties, and has only five towns with a population of over 20,000. Cumbria is also one of the country's most ethnically homogeneous counties, with 95.1% of the population categorised as [[White British]] (around 470,900 of the 495,000 Cumbrians).<ref name=\"2009ethnicity\">{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_population/lad-tables-2009.xls |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810102910/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_population/lad-tables-2009.xls |archivedate=10 August 2011 | title=Current Estimates \u2013 Population Estimates by Ethnic Group Mid-2009 (experimental) | publisher=[[Office for National Statistics]] | accessdate=20 May 2011}}</ref> However, the larger towns have ethnic makeups that are closer to the national average.
