[[Mirtazapine]], although not effective by itself, has been shown to hasten the effect of [[paroxetine]] (Pallanti ''et al.,'' 2004), and several studies have shown that atypical antipsychotics augment the effects of SSRIs in refractory OCD patients (Bloch ''et al.,'' 2006).<ref>{{Cite book|chapter=The Serotonergic System in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder|last=van Dijk|first=Addy|last2=Klompmakers|first2=Andre|last3=Denys|first3=Damiaan|pages=547\u2013563|doi=10.1016/s1569-7339(10)70100-4|title = Handbook of the Behavioral Neurobiology of Serotonin|volume = 21|series = Handbook of Behavioral Neuroscience|year = 2010|isbn = 9780123746344}}</ref>  While these findings do not provide an explicit cause, they do set the stage for the notion that psychiatric conditions can be dissected pharmacologically.

In the 1980s, a large cohort of children with OCD were being evaluated prospectively. Following a [[streptococcal]] infection, a subgroup of children expressed OCD symptom exacerbations that were characterized as \u201ccoming on overnight.<ref name=\"Leonard, H. L. 2001\"/>\u201d The primary hypothesis derived from this study is that in some cases, OCD may develop as a consequence of an autoimmune reaction in which antibodies to streptococcal infections attack and damage the basal ganglia.\n\nObsessions and compulsions are also very common in several other medical conditions, including: [[Tourette syndrome]], [[Parkinson disease]], [[epilepsy]], [[schizophrenia]], [[Huntington disease]], [[encephalitis lethargica]], [[Sydenham chorea]], and damage to specific brain regions.<ref>Nestadt, G., Grados, M., & Samuels, J. F. (2010). Genetics of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. Psychiatric Clinics of North America, 141-158.</ref> Similar to OCD, these disorders also exhibit abnormalities in the basal ganglia. This portion of the brain is responsible for mediating cognition, emotion, and movement. Disruption of the basal ganglia results in a host of symptoms that are characterized by compulsivity (behavioral patterns that are released repeatedly) and impulsivity (behavioral patterns that are released suddenly by various stimuli).<ref name=\"Maia, T.

The majority of family association studies demonstrated that at least some forms of OCD are familial. The rate of OCD among relatives of affected individuals was significantly higher than the estimated population prevalence of OCD and the rate among controls. Relatives of adults with OCD were approximately two times more likely to be affected than the controls, while relatives of children and adolescents with OCD were about ten times more likely to have OCD as well. However, that familial association could also have been caused by cultural or environmental factors.<ref name=pauls2010>{{cite journal | last1 = Pauls | first1 = David L. | year = 2010 | title = The Genetics of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: A Review | url = | journal = Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience | volume = 12 | issue = 2| pages = 149\u2013163 }}</ref> Currently, there have been very few studies investigating the environmental factors behind OCD.

The classic twin study compares monozygotic and dizygotic twins. If the monozygotic twins resemble each other much more closely than the dizygotic twins, then it is likely that genetics play a strong role in the development of the trait of interest. These studies showed that the genetic influences on obsessive-compulsive symptoms were 45 to 65% in children. The influence was less in adults, ranging from 27 to 47%.<ref name=grootheest2005/> However, the results of the studies are complicated by the fact that the presence of individuals with OCD in the sample were frequently low. As a result, researchers oftentimes included individuals with obsessive-compulsive symptoms or subclinical OCD.<ref name=pauls2010/> By doing so, they possibly included subjects that were suffering from other, related disorders. Early twin studies were replicated later using twins with OCD meeting DSM criteria and ascertainment of [[proband]]s, but only a few have been performed.<ref name=grootheest2005/>\n\n===Early Onset OCD===\n\nEarly onset OCD, manifesting in childhood or adolescence, is a subtype of OCD etiologically distinct from adult onset OCD.  This early onset OCD is reported to be genetically related to tic disorders and [[Tourette syndrome]], as one study has found that patients with early onset OCD have a higher rate of Tourette's and other tic disorders.<ref name =vasconcelos2007/> Family association studies<ref name=eichstedt2001>{{cite journal | last1 = Eichstedt | first1 = Julie A. | last2 = Arnold | first2 = Sharon L. | year = 2001 | title = Childhood-onset Obsessive Compulsive Disorder: A Tic-Related Subtype of OCD? | url = | journal = Clinical Psychology Review | volume = 21 | issue = 1| pages = 137\u2013158 }}</ref> have suggested that early onset OCD is correlated to increased familial and possibly genetic risk. The rate of OCD and subclinical OCD among relatives of probands whose OCD manifested in childhood or adolescence was at least twice as high as the rate among relatives of probands whose OCD manifested in adulthood.<ref name=eichstedt2001/> Other studies have also indicated that there is an inverse relationship between the age of onset of the proband and the risk of OCD in relatives.<ref name=nestadt2010>{{cite journal | last1 = Nestadt | first1 = Gerald | last2 = Grados | first2 = Marco | last3 = Samuels | first3 = J.

Some of those candidate genes have been identified but none of the candidate gene studies have been consistently replicated except those relating to the glutamate transporter gene, SLC1A1 (solute carrier family 1, member 1), which codes for the [[Excitatory amino-acid transporter|glutamate transporter]], EAAC1.<ref name=pauls2010/> It has been suggested that the difficulties in identifying candidate genes may be related to the fact that most gene research has ignored environmental factors.[9] Consequently, it may be necessary to develop models for the interaction between genetic and environmental factors for certain subtypes of OCD to further genetic research. Three [[Genome-wide association study|genome-wide association studies]] of OCD have also been completed, which have suggested potential regions of interest, including the region containing SLC1A1, 9p24.<ref name=pauls2010/> SLC1A1 is expressed in the cortex, striatum, and thalamus (the cortico-striato-thalamocortical circuit) and is related to glutamate neurotransmission.<ref name=kanai2003>Yoshikatsu Kanai and Matthias A.

Neuroimaging studies have found that caudate glutamatergic concentrations are lower in the [[Anterior cingulate cortex|anterior cingulate]] and higher in the [[Caudate nucleus|caudate]] in early onset OCD patients compared to controls, suggesting that glutamate transport (and in turn, the glutamate transporter gene SLC1A1) is related to the onset of OCD.<ref name=rosenberg2000>{{cite journal | last1 = Rosenberg | first1 = David R. | last2 = MacMaster | first2 = Frank P. | last3 = Keshavan | first3 = Matcheri S. | display-authors = etal | year = 2000 | title = Decrease in Caudate Glutamatergic Concentrations in Pediatric Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Patients Taking Paroxetine | url = | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry | volume = 39 | issue = 9| pages = 1096\u20131103 | doi=10.1097/00004583-200009000-00008}}</ref>\n\n[[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|Single nucleotide polymorphisms]] (SNPs) in the gene SLC1A1 have consistently been found to be related to OCD. In addition to glutamate transport, EAAC1, the transporter coded by SLC1A1, has also been linked to GABA synthesis, which could promote susceptibility to OCD.

However, the exact SNPs identified in the different studies vary, though it is possible that this is because the studies were conducted on different ethnic populations.<ref name=wu2013/> For example, a family-based association study analyzed the instances of SNPs in and around SLC1A1 in families from throughout the US and found that a different SNP, rs4740788, and a 3-SNP haplotype, rs4740788-rs10491734-rs10491733, were both related to OCD.<ref name=samuels2011>{{cite journal | last1 = Samuels | first1 = Jack | last2 = Wang | first2 = Ying | last3 = Riddle | first3 = Mark A. | display-authors = etal | year = 2011 | title = Comprehensive Family-Based Association Study of the Glutamate Transporter Gene SLC1A1 in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder | url = | journal = American Journal of Medical Genetics Part B: Neuropsychiatric Genetics | volume = 156 | issue = 4| pages = 472\u2013477 | doi=10.1002/ajmg.b.31184| pmc = 3082623 | pmid = 21445956 }}</ref>\n\nSeveral mouse models have been developed for the study of obsessive-compulsive disorder. [[Model organism]]s are useful for allowing aspects of some psychiatric disorders in one species (in this case, humans) to be explored in other species (in this case, mice). Notably, SLC1A1 null mice demonstrated compulsive behaviors by exhibiting increased aggression and excessive self-grooming resulting in fur loss. However, since these were only two behaviors loosely linked to OCD, this did not provide strong evidence for the relation between the loss of EAAC1 and OCD-like behaviors. Given the strong correlation between the gene SLC1A1 and OCD, this suggests that the lack of EAAC1 only results in OCD-like behaviors when it is combined with other rare mutations in genes related to the CSTC, or cortico-striato-thalamocortical, circuit.<ref name=ting2011>{{cite journal | last1 = Ting | first1 = Jonathan T. | last2 = Feng | first2 = Guoping | year = 2011 | title = Neurobiology of Obsessive-compulsive Disorder: Insights into Neural Circuitry Dysfunction through Mouse Genetics | url = | journal = Current Opinion in Neurobiology | volume = 21 | issue = 6| pages = 842\u2013848 | doi = 10.1016/j.conb.2011.04.010 | hdl = 1721.1/102180 }}</ref>\n\n==Neuroethology==\n\nThe vast monolith of psychiatric research has placed an emphasis on proximate mechanisms as the cause for illness. In contrast, [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary theory]] has engendered questions regarding how distal mechanisms may be implicated with pathogenesis. OCD involves several behavioral schemata that may have been preserved over evolutionary history. Numerous species have inherited cognitive patterns that lend to checking for danger, avoiding contamination, and hoarding food.<ref>O'Connor, J. J. (2008). A Flaw in the Fabric. Journal of Contemporary Psychotherapy, 87-96.</ref> Theorists have hypothesized that a dysfunction in any of these strategies could lead to the expression of OCD. This conjecture is further supported by evidence that such inherited, species-specific strategies are stored in the basal ganglia.<ref name=\"Maia, T.

Clinical studies with these drugs, however, have shown the opposite. [[Mirtazapine]], although not effective by itself, has been shown to hasten the effect of [[paroxetine]] (Pallanti ''et al.,'' 2004), and several studies have shown that atypical antipsychotics augment the effects of SSRIs in refractory OCD patients (Bloch ''et al.,'' 2006).<ref>{{Cite book|chapter=The Serotonergic System in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder|last=van Dijk|first=Addy|last2=Klompmakers|first2=Andre|last3=Denys|first3=Damiaan|pages=547\u2013563|doi=10.1016/s1569-7339(10)70100-4|title = Handbook of the Behavioral Neurobiology of Serotonin|volume = 21|series = Handbook of Behavioral Neuroscience|year = 2010|isbn = 9780123746344}}</ref>  While these findings do not provide an explicit cause, they do set the stage for the notion that psychiatric conditions can be dissected pharmacologically.

International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology (4), 191-198</ref>\u201d The researchers suggest that post-streptococcal [[autoimmunity]] may be a potential environmental cause of childhood onset OCD. In the 1980s, a large cohort of children with OCD were being evaluated prospectively. Following a [[streptococcal]] infection, a subgroup of children expressed OCD symptom exacerbations that were characterized as \u201ccoming on overnight.<ref name=\"Leonard, H. L. 2001\"/>\u201d The primary hypothesis derived from this study is that in some cases, OCD may develop as a consequence of an autoimmune reaction in which antibodies to streptococcal infections attack and damage the basal ganglia.\n\nObsessions and compulsions are also very common in several other medical conditions, including: [[Tourette syndrome]], [[Parkinson disease]], [[epilepsy]], [[schizophrenia]], [[Huntington disease]], [[encephalitis lethargica]], [[Sydenham chorea]], and damage to specific brain regions.<ref>Nestadt, G., Grados, M., & Samuels, J. F. (2010). Genetics of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. Psychiatric Clinics of North America, 141-158.</ref> Similar to OCD, these disorders also exhibit abnormalities in the basal ganglia. This portion of the brain is responsible for mediating cognition, emotion, and movement. Disruption of the basal ganglia results in a host of symptoms that are characterized by compulsivity (behavioral patterns that are released repeatedly) and impulsivity (behavioral patterns that are released suddenly by various stimuli).<ref name=\"Maia, T. V. 2008\"/> This suggests that in patients with OCD, the disorder may be the result of abnormal functioning of the basal ganglia.\n\n==Neurogenetics==\n\n===Studies suggesting Genetic Factors for OCD===\n\n[[Twin study|Twin studies]]<ref name=grootheest2005>Daniel S. van Grootheest, Danielle C.

Boomsma, \"Twin Studies on Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: A Review,\" Twin Research and Human Genetics 8, no. 5 (2005): 450-458.</ref> and family association studies have demonstrated that there are definite genetic factors underlying obsessive-compulsive disorder. The majority of family association studies demonstrated that at least some forms of OCD are familial. The rate of OCD among relatives of affected individuals was significantly higher than the estimated population prevalence of OCD and the rate among controls. Relatives of adults with OCD were approximately two times more likely to be affected than the controls, while relatives of children and adolescents with OCD were about ten times more likely to have OCD as well. However, that familial association could also have been caused by cultural or environmental factors.<ref name=pauls2010>David L. Pauls, \"The Genetics of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: A Review,\" Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience 12, no. 2 (2010): 149-163.</ref> Currently, there have been very few studies investigating the environmental factors behind OCD.

The classic twin study compares monozygotic and dizygotic twins. If the monozygotic twins resemble each other much more closely than the dizygotic twins, then it is likely that genetics play a strong role in the development of the trait of interest. These studies showed that the genetic influences on obsessive-compulsive symptoms were 45 to 65% in children. The influence was less in adults, ranging from 27 to 47%.<ref name=grootheest2005/> However, the results of the studies are complicated by the fact that the presence of individuals with OCD in the sample were frequently low. As a result, researchers oftentimes included individuals with obsessive-compulsive symptoms or subclinical OCD.<ref name=pauls2010/> By doing so, they possibly included subjects that were suffering from other, related disorders. Early twin studies were replicated later using twins with OCD meeting DSM criteria and ascertainment of [[proband]]s, but only a few have been performed.<ref name=grootheest2005/>\n\n===Early Onset OCD===\n\nEarly onset OCD, manifesting in childhood or adolescence, is a subtype of OCD etiologically distinct from adult onset OCD.  This early onset OCD is reported to be genetically related to tic disorders and [[Tourette syndrome]], as one study has found that patients with early onset OCD have a higher rate of Tourette's and other tic disorders.<ref name =vasconcelos2007/> Family association studies<ref name=eichstedt2001>Julie A. Eichstedt and Sharon L. Arnold, \"Childhood-onset Obsessive Compulsive Disorder: A Tic-Related Subtype of OCD?\", Clinical Psychology Review 21, no. 1 (2001): 137-158.</ref> have suggested that early onset OCD is correlated to increased familial and possibly genetic risk. The rate of OCD and subclinical OCD among relatives of probands whose OCD manifested in childhood or adolescence was at least twice as high as the rate among relatives of probands whose OCD manifested in adulthood.<ref name=eichstedt2001/> Other studies have also indicated that there is an inverse relationship between the age of onset of the proband and the risk of OCD in relatives.<ref name=nestadt2010>{{cite journal | last1 = Nestadt | first1 = Gerald | last2 = Grados | first2 = Marco | last3 = Samuels | first3 = J.

Some of those candidate genes have been identified but none of the candidate gene studies have been consistently replicated except those relating to the glutamate transporter gene, SLC1A1 (solute carrier family 1, member 1), which codes for the [[Excitatory amino-acid transporter|glutamate transporter]], EAAC1.<ref name=pauls2010/> It has been suggested that the difficulties in identifying candidate genes may be related to the fact that most gene research has ignored environmental factors.[9] Consequently, it may be necessary to develop models for the interaction between genetic and environmental factors for certain subtypes of OCD to further genetic research. Three [[Genome-wide association study|genome-wide association studies]] of OCD have also been completed, which have suggested potential regions of interest, including the region containing SLC1A1, 9p24.<ref name=pauls2010/> SLC1A1 is expressed in the cortex, striatum, and thalamus (the cortico-striato-thalamocortical circuit) and is related to glutamate neurotransmission.<ref name=kanai2003>Yoshikatsu Kanai and Matthias A.

Neuroimaging studies have found that caudate glutamatergic concentrations are lower in the [[Anterior cingulate cortex|anterior cingulate]] and higher in the [[Caudate nucleus|caudate]] in early onset OCD patients compared to controls, suggesting that glutamate transport (and in turn, the glutamate transporter gene SLC1A1) is related to the onset of OCD.<ref name=rosenberg2000>{{cite journal | last1 = Rosenberg | first1 = David R. | last2 = MacMaster | first2 = Frank P. | last3 = Keshavan | first3 = Matcheri S. | display-authors = etal | year = 2000 | title = Decrease in Caudate Glutamatergic Concentrations in Pediatric Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Patients Taking Paroxetine | url = | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry | volume = 39 | issue = 9| pages = 1096\u20131103 | doi=10.1097/00004583-200009000-00008}}</ref>\n\n[[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|Single nucleotide polymorphisms]] (SNPs) in the gene SLC1A1 have consistently been found to be related to OCD. In addition to glutamate transport, EAAC1, the transporter coded by SLC1A1, has also been linked to GABA synthesis, which could promote susceptibility to OCD. An initial study demonstrated a significant association between OCD and 3 linked polymorphisms in the SLC1A1 gene.<ref name=arnold2006>{{cite journal | last1 = Daniel Arnold | first1 = Paul | last2 = Sicard | first2 = Tricia | last3 = Burroughs | first3 = Eliza | last4 = Richter | first4 = Margaret A. | last5 = Kennedy | first5 = James L. | year = 2006 | title = Glutamate Transporter Gene SLC1A1 Associated With Obsessive-compulsive Disorder | url = | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 63 | issue = 7| pages = 769\u2013776 | doi=10.1001/archpsyc.63.7.769}}</ref> This result has been replicated in numerous studies.

However, the exact SNPs identified in the different studies vary, though it is possible that this is because the studies were conducted on different ethnic populations.<ref name=wu2013/> For example, a family-based association study analyzed the instances of SNPs in and around SLC1A1 in families from throughout the US and found that a different SNP, rs4740788, and a 3-SNP haplotype, rs4740788-rs10491734-rs10491733, were both related to OCD.<ref name=samuels2011>{{cite journal | last1 = Samuels | first1 = Jack | last2 = Wang | first2 = Ying | last3 = Riddle | first3 = Mark A. | display-authors = etal | year = 2011 | title = Comprehensive Family-Based Association Study of the Glutamate Transporter Gene SLC1A1 in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder | url = | journal = American Journal of Medical Genetics Part B: Neuropsychiatric Genetics | volume = 156 | issue = 4| pages = 472\u2013477 | doi=10.1002/ajmg.b.31184| pmc = 3082623 }}</ref>\n\nSeveral mouse models have been developed for the study of obsessive-compulsive disorder. [[Model organism]]s are useful for allowing aspects of some psychiatric disorders in one species (in this case, humans) to be explored in other species (in this case, mice). Notably, SLC1A1 null mice demonstrated compulsive behaviors by exhibiting increased aggression and excessive self-grooming resulting in fur loss. However, since these were only two behaviors loosely linked to OCD, this did not provide strong evidence for the relation between the loss of EAAC1 and OCD-like behaviors. Given the strong correlation between the gene SLC1A1 and OCD, this suggests that the lack of EAAC1 only results in OCD-like behaviors when it is combined with other rare mutations in genes related to the CSTC, or cortico-striato-thalamocortical, circuit.<ref name=ting2011>{{cite journal | last1 = Ting | first1 = Jonathan T. | last2 = Feng | first2 = Guoping | year = 2011 | title = Neurobiology of Obsessive-compulsive Disorder: Insights into Neural Circuitry Dysfunction through Mouse Genetics | url = | journal = Current Opinion in Neurobiology | volume = 21 | issue = 6| pages = 842\u2013848 | doi = 10.1016/j.conb.2011.04.010 | hdl = 1721.1/102180 }}</ref>\n\n==Neuroethology==\n\nThe vast monolith of psychiatric research has placed an emphasis on proximate mechanisms as the cause for illness. In contrast, [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary theory]] has engendered questions regarding how distal mechanisms may be implicated with pathogenesis. OCD involves several behavioral schemata that may have been preserved over evolutionary history. Numerous species have inherited cognitive patterns that lend to checking for danger, avoiding contamination, and hoarding food.<ref>O'Connor, J. J. (2008). A Flaw in the Fabric. Journal of Contemporary Psychotherapy, 87-96.</ref> Theorists have hypothesized that a dysfunction in any of these strategies could lead to the expression of OCD. This conjecture is further supported by evidence that such inherited, species-specific strategies are stored in the basal ganglia.<ref name=\"Maia, T. V. 2008\"/>\n\n[[File:Canine lick granuloma.jpg|right|thumb|[[Lick granuloma]] from excessive licking]]\nWhen considering the expression of OCD in non-human species, researchers have studied [[acral lick dermatitis]] (also known as [[lick granuloma]]) in large canines. This disorder is characterized by excessive licking or scratching that leads to alopecia (hair loss) and subsequent granulomatous lesions (vascular tissue on the surface of a wound).<ref name=\"Rapoport, J. L. 1992\"/> Rapoport et al. found that this obsessive-compulsive behavior was alleviated in afflicted canines after administering clomipramine.<ref name=\"Rapoport, J.

G. Daily]], [[Harris Yulin]] and [[Richard Lynch (actor)|Richard Lynch]]. It was produced by [[Gale Anne Hurd]]. The plot follows a woman who awakens from a thirteen-year-long [[coma]] and finds herself being stalked by the ghost of a [[cult|cult leader]] who led a [[mass suicide]] by fire that she survived as a child.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1975, a [[cult]] called Unity Fields commits [[mass suicide]] in a horrific manner\u2014by fire\u2014at the behest of its psychopathic leader, Franklin Harris. Only one young woman named Cynthia, a child at the time of the fire, survives, though she lies in a coma for thirteen years.\n\nAfter she wakes, Cynthia is plagued by horrific flashbacks of her childhood at Unity Fields, and is forced to attend experimental [[group therapy]] sessions for [[borderline personality disorder]] at the hospital led by Dr. Alex Karmen. Cynthia's visions become more vivid, and include Harris, who often appears to her with his flesh burnt. When her roommate, Miriam, is discharged from the hospital, Cynthia has a vision of Harris in the elevator with her; however, the doors close before she is able to warn her. Miriam is found dead on the sidewalk in front of the hospital, having leapt from a window in what appears to be a suicide.\n\nA male and female patient are later killed by the blades on an industrial fan in a utility room of the hospital, which Cynthia also attributes to Harris, who she believes has come back from his death to kill those around her. Ralph, a troubled [[Sadomasochism|masochist]] patient, becomes enamored with Cynthia; one day, they take an elevator to the basement of the hospital. During an episode, he commits suicide by stabbing himself multiple times in the abdomen.\n\nAwakening from sedation after the incident, Cynthia finds Harris sitting in her room, calling her his \"love child,\" and urging her to commit suicide. Shortly after, Harris visits Gilda, a [[clairvoyant]] patient, in her room. Instead of allowing him to kill her, she drinks [[formaldehyde]] she stole from a supply room, effectively killing herself. When Dr. Karmen discovers his corrupt peer, Dr. Berrisford, has intentionally laced the therapy group's drugs with psychogenic substances (in the hope that it will effectively make the patients suicidal, and thus corroborate Berrisford's research), he confronts Cynthia, insisting her visions of Harris are not real.\n\nDr. Karmen then pulls an emergency alarm in the hospital, which elicits chaos. Cynthia escapes to the rooftop, where Dr. Karmen finds her standing on the ledge. Harris, invisible to Dr. Karmen, urges Cynthia to jump. She leaps from the building, but before hitting the ground below, awakens back at the house in which the Unity Fields members committed suicide. There, she is confronted by Harris, who welcomes her; however, it is only a vision, and she awakens to Dr. Karmen holding her by the arm as she dangles over the ledge. Berrisford, aware that Dr. Karmen has discovered his plot, goes to the rooftop as well, and attempts to push Dr. Karmen to his death as well. His attempt is thwarted by the arrival of hospital security, and Berrisford insists that Dr. Karmen is responsible for altering the patients' medication. He then pulls a revolver from his coat, but before he is able to shoot, Cynthia pushes him to his death.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jennifer Rubin (actress)|Jennifer Rubin]] as Cynthia Weston\n* [[Bruce Abbott]] as Dr. Alex Karmen\n* [[Richard Lynch (actor)|Richard Lynch]] as Franklin Harris\n* [[Dean Cameron]] as Ralph Pesco\n* [[Harris Yulin]] as Dr. Berrisford\n* Susan Barnes as Connie\n* John Scott Clough as Victor\n* [[Elizabeth Daily|E.

G. Daily]], [[Harris Yulin]] and [[Richard Lynch (actor)|Richard Lynch]]. It was produced by [[Gale Anne Hurd]]. The plot follows a woman who awakens from a thirteen-year-long [[coma]] and finds herself being stalked by the ghost of a [[cult|cult leader]] who led a [[mass suicide]] by fire that she survived as a child.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1975, a [[cult]] called Unity Fields commits [[mass suicide]] in a horrific manner\u2014by fire\u2014at the behest of its psychopathic leader, Franklin Harris. Only one young woman named Cynthia, a child at the time of the fire, survives, though she lies in a coma for thirteen years.\n\nAfter she wakes, Cynthia is plagued by horrific flashbacks of her childhood at Unity Fields, and is forced to attend experimental [[group therapy]] sessions for [[borderline personality disorder]] at the hospital led by Dr. Alex Karmen. Cynthia's visions become more vivid, and include Harris, who often appears to her with his flesh burnt. When her roommate, Miriam, is discharged from the hospital, Cynthia has a vision of Harris in the elevator with her; however, the doors close before she is able to warn her. Miriam is found dead on the sidewalk in front of the hospital, having leapt from a window in what appears to be a suicide.\n\nA male and female patient are later killed by the blades on an industrial fan in a utility room of the hospital, which Cynthia also attributes to Harris, who she believes has come back from his death to kill those around her. Ralph, a troubled [[Sadomasochism|masochist]] patient, becomes enamored with Cynthia; one day, they take an elevator to the basement of the hospital. During an episode, he commits suicide by stabbing himself multiple times in the abdomen.\n\nAwakening from sedation after the incident, Cynthia finds Harris sitting in her room, calling her his \"love child,\" and urging her to commit suicide. Shortly after, Harris visits Gilda, a [[clairvoyant]] patient, in her room. Instead of allowing him to kill her, she drinks [[formaldehyde]] she stole from a supply room, effectively killing herself. When Dr. Karmen discovers his corrupt peer, Dr. Berrisford, has intentionally laced the therapy group's drugs with psychogenic substances (in the hope that it will effectively make the patients suicidal, and thus corroborate Berrisford's research), he confronts Cynthia, insisting her visions of Harris are not real.\n\nDr. Karmen then pulls an emergency alarm in the hospital, which elicits chaos. Cynthia escapes to the rooftop, where Dr. Karmen finds her standing on the ledge. Harris, invisible to Dr. Karmen, urges Cynthia to jump. She leaps from the building, but before hitting the ground below, awakens back at the house in which the Unity Fields members committed suicide. There, she is confronted by Harris, who welcomes her; however, it is only a vision, and she awakens to Dr. Karmen holding her by the arm as she dangles over the ledge. Berrisford, aware that Dr. Karmen has discovered his plot, goes to the rooftop as well, and attempts to push Dr. Karmen to his death as well. His attempt is thwarted by the arrival of hospital security, and Berrisford insists that Dr. Karmen is responsible for altering the patients' medication. He then pulls a revolver from his coat, but before he is able to shoot, Cynthia pushes him to his death.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jennifer Rubin (actress)|Jennifer Rubin]] as Cynthia Weston\n* [[Bruce Abbott]] as Dr. Alex Karmen\n* [[Richard Lynch (actor)|Richard Lynch]] as Franklin Harris\n* [[Dean Cameron]] as Ralph Pesco\n* [[Harris Yulin]] as Dr. Berrisford\n* Susan Barnes as Connie\n* John Scott Clough as Victor\n* [[Elizabeth Daily|E.

Parsons was appointed provisional governor of Alabama in June after the war's end.\n\nThe four Union soldiers and one Confederate killed that day are described by author Rex Miller as the last to die in open combat by contending military forces.<ref>{{citation |last=Miller |first=Rex |title=Croxton's Raid |location=Fort Collins, Colorado |publisher=Old Army Press |year=1979 |isbn=0-88342-244-1}}</ref>\n\n{{quote\n|THE LAST BATTLE.\n\nNumerous battles have been written up as \"the last fight of the rebellion.\" Without disputing in regard to the matter it is a fact, not generally known, that a battalion (the saber battalion) of the Second Michigan cavalry, under brevet Major Whittemore, charged the force under General Hill, near Talladega, Alabama, on the 23d of April, 1865, and was supported by the regiment and brigade, scattering the entire Confederate force and capturing the artillery, and many prisoners. This was fourteen days after the surrender at Appomattox, and therefore quite late enough after a cessation of hostilities.

He has seven overbearing sisters who ridicule and emotionally abuse him regularly, and he leads a lonely life punctuated by fits of rage and social anxiety. One day, he witnesses an inexplicable car accident, picks up an abandoned [[pump organ|harmonium]] from the street, and encounters Lena Leonard, a coworker for one of his sisters, Elizabeth. Lena had orchestrated this meeting after seeing him in a family picture belonging to Elizabeth.\n\nBarry goes to his sister's birthday party, where the rest of his sisters ridicule him. They bring up the times when they would call him \"gay boy\" until he got mad. They bring up an incident from when he was younger when he threw a hammer through their sliding glass window. He reacts angrily, shattering his sister's windows. He talks to his brother-in-law, where he asks if he can give him the phone number to a therapist.\n\nCoping with his loneliness, Barry calls a phone-sex line, but the operator attempts to extort money and sends her four henchmen, who are brothers, to collect. This complicates his budding relationship with Lena, as well as his plan to exploit a loophole in a [[Healthy Choice]] promotion and amass a million [[Frequent flyer program|frequent flyer miles]] by purchasing large quantities of pudding.\n\nAfter Lena leaves for [[Hawaii]] on a business trip, Barry decides to follow her. He arrives and calls Elizabeth to find out where Lena is staying. When his sister starts abusing him again, Barry snaps and demands she give him the information, which she does. Lena is overjoyed to see Barry. They spend time together and make love. At first, Barry explains that he is in Hawaii on a business trip by coincidence, but he soon admits that he came only for her. When Barry's sister calls Lena in Hawaii, Lena tells her that she has not had any contact with Barry, loyally preserving his and their privacy. The romance develops further, and Barry finally feels some relief from the emotional isolation he has endured.\n\nAfter they return home, the four brothers ram their car into Barry's, leaving Lena mildly injured. With his new-found freedom from loneliness in jeopardy, a surprisingly aggressive and poised Barry adeptly fights off all four of the goons in a matter of seconds, using a [[tire iron]]. Wanting to make sure Lena is recovered, Barry leaves her at the hospital and tries to end the harassment by calling the phone-sex line back and speaking to the \"supervisor\", who turns out to be Dean Trumbell, the owner of a mattress store in [[Provo, Utah]]. There, Barry confronts Dean face to face. Dean, at first trying to intimidate Barry, finds him more intimidating after he tells him that he is in love and it makes him stronger than anyone else. An end to the harassment is implied once Dean learns that Barry has come all the way from California, and confronts him instead of going to the police, though Dean tries to save face by getting in the last word.\n\nBarry returns to Lena's apartment, and tells her everything, about the phone-sex episode, and Dean's goons, and begs her for forgiveness, pledging his loyalty and to use his frequent-flier miles to accompany her on all future business trips in just six to eight weeks after his pudding miles are processed.

As with ''[[Magnolia (film)|Magnolia]]'', Brion and Anderson collaborated heavily for the production of the film's score. However, rather than scoring the film after rough footage had been shot, Brion made compositions while making the film. During the scoring process, Brion would experiment with tones and sounds, carefully making note of what Anderson would respond to. Anderson himself would create the vocal tempos he would envision in the score and use them on set, even to the extent of inspiring the pace of Sandler's performance.\n\nThe film's score features heavy use of the [[harmonium]]. Brion had introduced Anderson for it on ''Magnolia'', and Anderson knew he wanted it to feature heavily in the score.<ref>Chapman, Glen (February 21, 2011).  [http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/17063/music-in-the-movies-jon-brion \"Music in the Movies: Jon Brion.\"]  ''Den of Geek'' (''DenOfGeek.us'').  Retrieved January 24, 2016.</ref> Many scenes between Sandler's character and the instrument were inspired by Brion. For instance, Brion once found a harmonium with a hole in its bellows before going on tour with [[Aimee Mann]]. To fix the problem, he covered the hole with duct tape. The situation is mirrored in the film.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"TheNumbers\">{{cite web| url= http://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Punch-Drunk-Love | title= Punch-Drunk Love| publisher= [[The Numbers (website)|The Numbers]]|accessdate= March 8, 2015| quote= Production Budget: $25,000,000}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==External links==\n{{sisterlinks|d=Q580716|c=Category:Punch-Drunk Love|wikt=no|s=no|n=no|b=no|v=no|voy=no|m=no|mw=no|species=no}}\n* {{IMDb title|0272338}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|punchdrunk_love}}\n* {{Metacritic film|punch-drunk-love}}\n* [http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/Punch-Drunk_Love.html Early draft screenplay  for ''Punch-Drunk Love''] from dailyscript.com\n*[https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/4302-punch-drunk-love-a-delegate-speaks ''Punch-Drunk Love: A Delegate Speaks''] an essay by [[Miranda July]] at the [[Criterion Collection]]\n\n{{Paul Thomas Anderson}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Punch-Drunk Love}}\n[[Category:2002 films]]\n[[Category:2000s romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:Columbia Pictures films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Paul Thomas Anderson]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Jon Brion]]\n[[Category:Films set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films set in Hawaii]]\n[[Category:Films shot in California]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Honolulu]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Paul Thomas Anderson]]\n[[Category:New Line Cinema films]]\n[[Category:Revolution Studios films]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox film\n| name           = Punch-Drunk Love\n| image          = Punch-Drunk Love poster.png\n| alt            =\n| caption        = Theatrical release poster\n| director       = [[Paul Thomas Anderson]]\n| producer       = {{Plainlist|\n* [[JoAnne Sellar]]\n* [[Daniel Lupi]]\n* Paul Thomas Anderson\n}}\n| writer         = Paul Thomas Anderson\n| starring       = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Adam Sandler]]\n* [[Emily Watson]]\n* [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]]\n* [[Luis Guzm\u00e1n]]\n}}\n| music          = [[Jon Brion]]\n| cinematography = [[Robert Elswit]]\n| editing        = [[Leslie Jones (editor)|Leslie Jones]]\n| studio         = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Columbia Pictures]]\n* [[Revolution Studios]]\n* [[New Line Cinema]]\n}}\n| distributor    = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group|Sony Pictures Releasing]]\n}}\n| released       = {{Film date|2002|05|19|[[2002 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]]|2002|11|01|United States}}\n| runtime        = 95 minutes\n| country        = United States\n| language       = English\n| budget         = $25 million<ref name=\"TheNumbers\"/>\n| gross          = $24.7 million<ref name=\"TheNumbers\"/>\n| image_size     = 215px\n}}\n'''''Punch-Drunk Love''''' is a 2002 American [[romance film|romantic]] [[comedy film]] written and directed by [[Paul Thomas Anderson]], and starring [[Adam Sandler]], [[Emily Watson]], [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]], [[Luis Guzm\u00e1n]] and [[Mary Lynn Rajskub]].

As with ''[[Magnolia (film)|Magnolia]]'', Brion and Anderson collaborated heavily for the production of the film's score. However, rather than scoring the film after rough footage had been shot, Brion made compositions while making the film. During the scoring process, Brion would experiment with tones and sounds, carefully making note of what Anderson would respond to. Anderson himself would create the vocal tempos he would envision in the score and use them on set, even to the extent of inspiring the pace of Sandler's performance.\n\nThe film's score features heavy use of the [[harmonium]]. Brion had introduced Anderson for it on ''Magnolia'', and Anderson knew he wanted it to feature heavily in the score.<ref>Chapman, Glen (February 21, 2011).  [http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/17063/music-in-the-movies-jon-brion \"Music in the Movies: Jon Brion.\"]  ''Den of Geek'' (''DenOfGeek.us'').  Retrieved January 24, 2016.</ref> Many scenes between Sandler's character and the instrument were inspired by Brion. For instance, Brion once found a harmonium with a hole in its bellows before going on tour with [[Aimee Mann]]. To fix the problem, he covered the hole with duct tape. The situation is mirrored in the film.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"TheNumbers\">{{cite web| url= http://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Punch-Drunk-Love | title= Punch-Drunk Love| publisher= [[The Numbers (website)|The Numbers]]|accessdate= March 8, 2015| quote= Production Budget: $25,000,000}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==External links==\n{{sisterlinks|d=Q580716|c=Category:Punch-Drunk Love|wikt=no|s=no|n=no|b=no|v=no|voy=no|m=no|mw=no|species=no}}\n* {{IMDb title|0272338}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|punchdrunk_love}}\n* {{Metacritic film|punch-drunk-love}}\n* [http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/Punch-Drunk_Love.html Early draft screenplay  for ''Punch-Drunk Love''] from dailyscript.com\n*[https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/4302-punch-drunk-love-a-delegate-speaks ''Punch-Drunk Love: A Delegate Speaks''] an essay by [[Miranda July]] at the [[Criterion Collection]]\n\n{{Paul Thomas Anderson}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Punch-Drunk Love}}\n[[Category:2002 films]]\n[[Category:2000s romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:Columbia Pictures films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Paul Thomas Anderson]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Jon Brion]]\n[[Category:Films set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films set in Hawaii]]\n[[Category:Films shot in California]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Honolulu]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Paul Thomas Anderson]]\n[[Category:New Line Cinema films]]\n[[Category:Revolution Studios films]]\n", "name_user": "2600:6c5e:4200:6a85:14d1:d559:b1db:8f3c", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch-Drunk_Love"}
