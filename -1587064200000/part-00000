The term is an [[exonym]] created from a [[French language|French]] transcription of the [[Anishinaabe]] term \"Nadouessioux\", and can refer to any ethnic group within the [[Great Sioux Nation]] or to any of the nation's many language dialects. The modern Sioux consist of two major divisions based on [[Siouan languages|language divisions]]: the [[Dakota people|Dakota]] and [[Lakota people|Lakota]].\n\nBefore the 17th century, the [[Dakota people|Santee Dakota]] ({{lang|dak|Is\u00e1\u014byathi}}; \"Knife\" also known as the Eastern Dakota) lived around [[Lake Superior]] with territories in present-day northern Minnesota and Wisconsin. They gathered wild rice, hunted woodland animals and used canoes to fish. Wars with the [[Ojibwe]] throughout the 1700s pushed the Dakota into southern Minnesota, where the Western Dakota (Yankton, Yanktonai) and Teton (Lakota) were residing. In the 1800s, the Dakota signed treaties with the United States, ceding much of their land in Minnesota. Failure of the United States to make treaty payments on time, as well as low food supplies, led to the [[Dakota War of 1862]], which resulted in the Dakota being exiled from Minnesota to numerous reservations in Nebraska, North and South Dakota and Canada. After 1870, the Dakota people began to return to Minnesota, creating the present-day reservations in the state.\n\nThe Yankton and Yanktonai Dakota ({{lang|dak|Ih\u00e1\u014bkt\u021fu\u014bwa\u014b}} and {{lang|dak|Ih\u00e1\u014bkt\u021fu\u014bwa\u014bna}}; \"Village-at-the-end\" and \"Little village-at-the-end\"), collectively also referred to by the [[exonym and endonym|endonym]] {{lang|dak|Wi\u010dh\u00edyena}}, resided in the [[Minnesota River]] area before ceding their land and moving to South Dakota in 1858. Despite ceding their lands, their treaty with the U.S. government allowed them to maintain their traditional role in the O\u010dh\u00e9thi \u0160ak\u00f3wi\u014b as the caretakers of the [[Pipestone National Monument|Pipestone Quarry]], which is the cultural center of the Sioux people. They are considered to be the Western Dakota (also called middle Sioux), and have in the past been erroneously classified as [[Nakota]].<ref>for a report on the long-established blunder of misnaming as \"Nakota\", the Yankton and the Yanktonai, see the article [[Nakota]]</ref> The actual Nakota are the [[Assiniboine]] and [[Nakoda (Stoney)|Stoney]] of [[Western Canada]] and [[Montana]].\n\nThe [[Lakota people|Lakota]], also called Teton ({{lang|dak|Th\u00edt\u021fu\u014bwa\u014b}}; possibly \"dwellers on the prairie\"), are the westernmost Sioux, known for their [[Plains Indians|hunting and warrior culture]]. With the arrival of the horse in the 1700s, the Lakota would become the most powerful tribe on the Plains by the 1850s. They fought the United States Army in the [[Sioux Wars]] including defeating the [[7th Cavalry Regiment]] at the [[Battle of Little Big Horn]]. The armed conflicts with the U.S. ended with the [[Wounded Knee Massacre]].\n\nThroughout the 20th and 21st centuries, the Dakota and Lakota would continue to fight for their [[treaty rights]], including the [[Wounded Knee incident]], [[Dakota Access Pipeline protests]] and the 1980 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case, ''[[United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians]]'', in which the court ruled that tribal lands covered under the [[Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868]] had been taken illegally by the US government, and the tribe was owed compensation plus interest. As of 2018, this amounted to more than $1 billion; the Sioux have refused the payment, demanding instead the [[Black Hills land claim|return of their land]]. Today, the Sioux maintain many separate tribal governments scattered across several reservations, communities, and reserves in [[North Dakota]], [[South Dakota]], [[Nebraska]], [[Minnesota]], and [[Montana]] in the United States; and [[Manitoba]], southern [[Saskatchewan]], and [[Alberta]] in Canada.\n\n==Culture==\n===Etymology===\n[[File:\"Black Tail Deer, Sioux Chief, also a policeman at Rosebud Agency.\" Department of Anthropology, 1904 World's Fair.jpg|thumb|right|Chief Black Tail Deer and his family at the [[1904 World's Fair]]]]\nThe Sioux people refer to the [[Great Sioux Nation]] as the '''O\u010dh\u00e9thi \u0160ak\u00f3wi\u014b''' (pronounced {{IPA-sio|o\u02c8t\u0283\u02b0et\u02b0i \u0283a\u02c8kow\u0129|}}, meaning \"Seven Council Fires\").

The term is an [[exonym]] created from a [[French language|French]] transcription of the [[Anishinaabe]] term \"Nadouessioux\", and can refer to any ethnic group within the [[Great Sioux Nation]] or to any of the nation's many language dialects. The modern Sioux consist of two major divisions based on [[Siouan languages|language divisions]]: the [[Dakota people|Dakota]] and [[Lakota people|Lakota]].\n\nBefore the 17th century, the [[Dakota people|Santee Dakota]] ({{lang|dak|Is\u00e1\u014byathi}}; \"Knife\" also known as the Eastern Dakota) lived around [[Lake Superior]] with territories in present-day northern Minnesota and Wisconsin. They gathered wild rice, hunted woodland animals and used canoes to fish. Wars with the [[Ojibwe]] throughout the 1700s pushed the Dakota into southern Minnesota, where the Western Dakota (Yankton, Yanktonai) and Teton (Lakota) were residing. In the 1800s, the Dakota signed treaties with the United States, ceding much of their land in Minnesota. Failure of the United States to make treaty payments on time, as well as low food supplies, led to the [[Dakota War of 1862]], which resulted in the Dakota being exiled from Minnesota to numerous reservations in Nebraska, North and South Dakota and Canada. After 1870, the Dakota people began to return to Minnesota, creating the present-day reservations in the state.\n\nThe Yankton and Yanktonai Dakota ({{lang|dak|Ih\u00e1\u014bkt\u021fu\u014bwa\u014b}} and {{lang|dak|Ih\u00e1\u014bkt\u021fu\u014bwa\u014bna}}; \"Village-at-the-end\" and \"Little village-at-the-end\"), collectively also referred to by the [[exonym and endonym|endonym]] {{lang|dak|Wi\u010dh\u00edyena}}, resided in the [[Minnesota River]] area before ceding their land and moving to South Dakota in 1858. Despite ceding their lands, their treaty with the U.S. government allowed them to maintain their traditional role in the O\u010dh\u00e9thi \u0160ak\u00f3wi\u014b as the caretakers of the [[Pipestone National Monument|Pipestone Quarry]], which is the cultural center of the Sioux people. They are considered to be the Western Dakota (also called middle Sioux), and have in the past been erroneously classified as [[Nakota]].<ref>for a report on the long-established blunder of misnaming as \"Nakota\", the Yankton and the Yanktonai, see the article [[Nakota]]</ref> The actual Nakota are the [[Assiniboine]] and [[Nakoda (Stoney)|Stoney]] of [[Western Canada]] and [[Montana]].\n\nThe [[Lakota people|Lakota]], also called Teton ({{lang|dak|Th\u00edt\u021fu\u014bwa\u014b}}; possibly \"dwellers on the prairie\"), are the westernmost Sioux, known for their [[Plains Indians|hunting and warrior culture]]. With the arrival of the horse in the 1700s, the Lakota would become the most powerful tribe on the Plains by the 1850s. They fought the United States Army in the [[Sioux Wars]] including defeating the [[7th Cavalry Regiment]] at the [[Battle of Little Big Horn]]. The armed conflicts with the U.S. ended with the [[Wounded Knee Massacre]].\n\nThroughout the 20th and 21st centuries, the Dakota and Lakota would continue to fight for their [[treaty rights]], including the [[Wounded Knee incident]], [[Dakota Access Pipeline protests]] and the 1980 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case, ''[[United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians]]'', in which the court ruled that tribal lands covered under the [[Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868]] had been taken illegally by the US government, and the tribe was owed compensation plus interest. As of 2018, this amounted to more than $1 billion; the Sioux have refused the payment, demanding instead the [[Black Hills land claim|return of their land]].

He ran aground on 5 December 1492 on the northern part of [[Hispaniola]], which the [[Ta\u00edno|Taino people]] had inhabited since the 9th century; the site became the first permanent European settlement in the Americas. Western European conquest, large-scale exploration and colonization soon followed. Columbus's first two voyages (1492\u201393) reached the [[Bahamas]] and various [[Caribbean islands]], including Hispaniola, [[Puerto Rico]], and [[Cuba]]. In 1497, Italian explorer [[John Cabot]], on behalf of [[Kingdom of England|England]], landed on the North American coast, and a year later, Columbus's [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus#Third voyage|third voyage]] reached the South American coast. As the sponsor of [[Christopher Columbus's voyages]], [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] was the first European power to settle and colonize the largest areas, from North America and the Caribbean to the southern tip of South America.\n\nThe [[Spain|Spaniards]] began building [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|their empire of the Americas]] in the [[Caribbean]], using islands such as Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Hispaniola as bases. The North and South American mainland fell to the [[conquistador]]s precipitating an estimated 8,000,000 deaths of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous populations]] primarily through the spread of [[Old World|Afro-Eurasian]] [[Infection|diseases]].<ref name=Histoire>\"La catastrophe d\u00e9mographique\" (The Demographic Catastrophe) in ''[[L'Histoire]]'' n\u00b0322, July\u2013August 2007, p. 17</ref> Some authors have argued this [[Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas|demographic collapse]] to be the first large-scale act of [[Genocide of indigenous peoples|genocide]] [[Genocides in history#1490 to 1914|in the modern era]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Forsythe|first=David P.|title=Encyclopedia of Human Rights, Volume 4|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-533402-9|p=297|ref= harv}}</ref> [[Florida]] fell to [[Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n]] after 1513.

Farther to the south, [[Francisco Pizarro]] [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|conquered]] the [[Inca Empire]] during the 1530s. The de Soto expedition was the first major encounter of Europeans with North American Indians in the eastern half of the United States. The expedition journeyed from Florida through present-day [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[the Carolinas]], then west across the Mississippi and into Texas. De Soto fought his [[Mabila|biggest battle]] at the walled town of Mabila in present-day Alabama on October 18, 1540. Spanish losses were 22 killed and 148 wounded.

In the 1494 [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], ratified by the Pope, these two kingdoms divided the entire non-European world into two areas of exploration and colonization, with a north to south boundary that cut through the Atlantic Ocean and the eastern part of present-day Brazil. Based on this treaty and on early claims by Spanish explorer [[Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa]], discoverer of the [[Pacific Ocean]] in 1513, the Spanish conquered large territories in North, Central and South America.\n\nAround the late 1490s, cartographer [[Amerigo Vespucci|Americo Vespuscio]] explored the American eastern coast, on behalf of both the Portuguese and Spanish crowns, and published in 1502\u20131503, his new book ''Mundus Novus'' (''New World''), which disproved the belief that the Americas were the easternmost part of Asia and, in actuallity, an entire new world.\n\n[[File:Non-Native-American-Nations-Territorial-Claims-over-NAFTA-countries-1750-2008.gif|thumb|Territorial evolution of North America of non-native nation states from 1750 to 2008]]\n[[File:Political Evolution of Central America and the Caribbean 1700 and on.gif|thumb|Central America and Caribbean sovereignty 1700\u2013present]]\n\nSpanish conquistador [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] took over the [[Aztec Empire|Aztec Kingdom]] and [[Francisco Pizarro]] conquered the [[Inca Empire]]. As a result, by the mid-16th century, the Spanish Crown had gained control of much of western South America, and southern [[North America]], in addition to its earlier [[Caribbean]] territories. Over this same timeframe, [[History of Portugal|Portugal]] claimed lands in North America (Canada) and colonized much of eastern South America, naming it [[History of Brazil|Santa Cruz and Brazil]].\n\n[[File:Imperios Espa\u00f1ol y Portugu\u00e9s 1790.svg|thumb|Spanish and Portuguese empires in 1790.]]\n\nOther [[Europe]]an nations soon disputed the terms of the Treaty of Tordesillas. England and [[Ancien R\u00e9gime in France|France]] attempted to plant colonies in the Americas in the 16th century, but these failed.

He was followed by other explorers such as [[John Cabot]], who was sponsored by England and reached Newfoundland. [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] reached Brazil and claimed it for Portugal.\n\n[[Amerigo Vespucci]], working for Portugal in voyages from 1497 to 1513, established that Columbus had reached a new set of continents. [[Cartography|Cartographers]] still use a [[Latinization (literature)|Latinized]] version of his first name, ''America'', for the two continents. Other explorers included [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]], sponsored by France in 1524; the Portuguese [[Jo\u00e3o Vaz Corte-Real]] in Newfoundland; [[Jo\u00e3o Fernandes Lavrador]], [[Gaspar Corte-Real|Gaspar]] and [[Miguel Corte-Real]] and [[Jo\u00e3o \u00c1lvares Fagundes]], in Newfoundland, Greenland, Labrador, and Nova Scotia (from 1498 to 1502, and in 1520); [[Jacques Cartier]] (1491\u20131557), [[Henry Hudson]] (1560s\u20131611), and [[Samuel de Champlain]] (1567\u20131635), who explored the region of Canada he reestablished as [[New France]].\n\nIn 1513, [[Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa]] crossed the [[Isthmus of Panama]] and led the first European expedition to see the Pacific Ocean from the [[History of the west coast of North America|west coast of the New World]]. In an action with enduring historical import, Balboa claimed the Pacific Ocean and all the lands adjoining it for the Spanish Crown. It was 1517 before another expedition, from [[Cuba]], visited Central America, [[Spanish colonization of the Yucat\u00e1n|landing on the coast of Yucat\u00e1n]] [[Slavery in the Spanish New World colonies|in search of slaves]].\n\n[[File:Iberian Union Empires2.png|thumb|Spanish and Portuguese colonies]]\nThese explorations were followed, notably in the case of Spain, by a phase of conquest: The Spaniards, having just finished the ''[[Reconquista]]'' of Spain from Muslim rule, were the first to colonize the Americas, applying the same model of governing their European holdings to their territories of the [[New World]].\n\nTen years after Columbus's discovery, the administration of [[Hispaniola]] was given to [[Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando]] of the [[Order of Alc\u00e1ntara]], founded during the ''Reconquista''. As in the [[Iberian Peninsula]], the [[Ta\u00edno people|inhabitants of Hispaniola]] were given new landmasters, while [[Roman Catholic religious order|religious orders]] handled the local administration. Progressively the ''[[encomienda]]'' system, which granted tribute (access to indigenous labor and taxation) to European settlers, was set in place.\n\nA relatively common misconception is that a small number of ''[[conquistadores]]'' conquered vast territories, aided only by disease epidemics and their powerful [[knight|caballeros]]. In fact, recent archaeological excavations have suggested a vast Spanish-Indian alliance numbering in the hundreds of thousands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ferturperu.info/discovery-the-inca-rebellion-of-1536/ |title=1536 Inca Rebellion unearthed &#124; Peruvian Travel Trends |publisher=Ferturperu.info |date=2009-09-22 |accessdate=2010-06-30}}</ref> [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] eventually [[Spanish conquest of Mexico|conquered Mexico]] with the help of [[Tlaxcala]] in 1519\u20131521, while the [[Spanish conquest of Peru|conquest of Peru]] was supported by some 40,000 Incan renegades led by [[Francisco Pizarro]] in between 1532 and 1535.\n\nOver the first century and a half after Columbus's voyages, the native population of the Americas plummeted by an estimated 80% (from around 50 million in 1492 to eight million in 1650),<ref name=Histoire/> mostly by outbreaks of [[Old World]] [[Infectious diseases|diseases]].\n\nIn 1532, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] sent a vice-king to Mexico, [[Antonio de Mendoza]], in order to prevent Cortes' independentist drives, who definitively returned to Spain in 1540. Two years later, Charles V signed the [[New Laws]] (which replaced the [[Laws of Burgos]] of 1512) prohibiting slavery and the ''[[repartimientos]]'', but also claiming as his own all the lands of the Americas and all of the indigenous people as his own subjects.\n\n[[File:Cabrera Pintura de Castas.jpg|thumb|upright|Painting depicting a [[Castas]] with his mixed-race daughter and his [[Mulatta]] wife by [[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]], 1763]]\nWhen Pope [[Alexander VI]] issued the ''[[Inter caetera]]'' bull in May 1493 granting the new lands to the [[Kingdom of Spain]], he requested in exchange an [[Roman Catholic Church and colonialism|evangelization of the people]]. Thus, during [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]]'s second voyage, [[Benedictine]] monks accompanied him, along with twelve other priests. As [[Slavery in medieval Europe|slavery]] was prohibited between Christians, and could only be imposed in non-Christian prisoners of war or on men already sold as slaves, the debate on Christianization was particularly acute during the 16th century. In 1537, the papal bull ''[[Sublimis Deus]]'' definitively recognized that Native Americans possessed souls, thus prohibiting their enslavement, without putting an end to the debate. Some claimed that a native who had rebelled and then been captured could be enslaved nonetheless.\n\nLater, two Dominican priests, [[Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas]] and the [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Juan Gin\u00e9s de Sep\u00falveda]], held the [[Valladolid debate]], with the former arguing that Native Americans were endowed with souls like all other human beings, while the latter argued to the contrary to justify their enslavement.\n\nThe process of Christianization was at first violent: when the first [[Franciscan]]s arrived in Mexico in 1524, they burned the places dedicated to pagan cult, alienating much of the local population.<ref name=Histoire2/> In the 1530s, they began to adapt Christian practices to local customs, including the building of new churches on the sites of ancient places of worship, leading to a mix of Old World Christianity with local religions.<ref name=Histoire2>\"Espagnols-Indiens: le choc des civilisations\", in ''[ 1523.\n\nTo reward their troops, the ''Conquistadores'' often allotted Indian towns to their troops and officers. Black African slaves were introduced to substitute for Native American labor in some locations\u2014including the [[West Indies]], where the indigenous population was nearing extinction on many islands.\n\nDuring this time, the Portuguese gradually switched from an initial plan of establishing trading posts to extensive [[colonization]] of what is now Brazil. They imported millions of slaves to run their plantations. The Portuguese and Spanish royal governments expected to rule these settlements and collect at least 20% of all treasure found (the ''[[quinto real]]'' collected by the ''[[Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n]]''), in addition to collecting all the taxes they could.

They were sponsored by [[common stock]] companies such as the chartered [[London Company|Virginia Company]] financed by wealthy Englishmen who exaggerated the economic potential of this new land. The main purpose of this colony was the hope of finding gold.<ref name=\"Taylor 2001\"/>\n\nIt took strong leaders, like [[John Smith of Jamestown|John Smith]], to convince the colonists of Jamestown that searching for gold was not taking care of their immediate needs for food and shelter and the [[Bible|biblical]] principle that \"he who will not work shall not eat\" (see [[2 Thessalonians 3]]). The lack of [[food security]] leading to extremely high mortality rate was quite distressing and cause for despair among the colonists. To support the Colony, numerous [[Jamestown supply missions|supply missions]] were organized. [[Tobacco]] later became a cash crop, with the work of [[John Rolfe]] and others, for export and the sustaining economic driver of [[Virginia]] and the neighboring colony of [[Maryland]].\n\nFrom the beginning of Virginia's settlements in 1587 until the 1680s, the main source of labor and a large portion of the immigrants were [[indentured servants]] looking for new life in the overseas colonies. During the 17th century, indentured servants constituted three-quarters of all European immigrants to the Chesapeake region. Most of the indentured servants were teenagers from England with poor economic prospects at home. Their fathers signed the papers that gave them free passage to America and an unpaid job until they became of age. They were given food, clothing, housing and taught farming or household skills. American landowners were in need of laborers and were willing to pay for a laborer's passage to America if they served them for several years. By selling passage for five to seven years worth of work, they could then start on their own in America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/nai_cilh/servitude.html |title=Indentured Servitude in Colonial America |first=Deanna |last=Barker |date=10 March 2004 |publisher=National Association for Interpretation, Cultural Interpretation and Living History Section |accessdate=5 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022161033/http://geocities.com/nai_cilh/servitude.html |archivedate=October 22, 2009 |df= }}</ref> Many of the migrants from England died in the first few years.<ref name=\"Taylor 2001\"/>\n\nEconomic advantage also prompted the [[Darien Scheme]], an ill-fated venture by the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] to settle the [[Isthmus of Panama]] in the late 1690s. The Darien Scheme aimed to control trade through that part of the world and thereby promote Scotland into a world trading power. However, it was doomed by poor planning, short provisions, weak leadership, lack of demand for trade goods, and devastating disease.<ref>John Prebble, ''Darien: the Scottish Dream of Empire'' (2000)</ref> The failure of the Darien Scheme was one of the factors that led the Kingdom of Scotland into the [[Act of Union 1707]] with the [[Kingdom of England]] creating the united [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and giving Scotland commercial access to English, now British, colonies.<ref>Brocklehurst, \"The Banker who Led Scotland to Disaster\".</ref>\n\nIn the French colonial regions, the focus of economy was on sugar plantations in Caribbean. In Canada the [[fur trade]] with the natives was important. About 16,000 French men and women became colonizers. The great majority became subsistence farmers along the [[St. Lawrence River]]. With a favorable disease environment and plenty of land and food, their numbers grew exponentially to 65,000 by 1760. Their colony was taken over by Britain in 1760, but social, religious, legal, cultural and economic changes were few in a society that clung tightly to its recently formed traditions.<ref>W.J.

English and Dutch colonies, on the other hand, tended to be more religiously diverse. Settlers to these colonies included [[Anglican]]s, Dutch [[Calvinists]], English [[Puritans]] and other [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformists]], [[Maryland Toleration Act|English Catholics]], Scottish [[Presbyterian]]s, French [[Huguenot]]s, German and Swedish [[Lutherans]], as well as [[Jews]], [[Quakers]], [[Mennonites]], [[Amish]], and [[Moravian Church|Moravians]].<ref>Patricia U. Bonomi, ''Under the cope of heaven: Religion, society, and politics in Colonial America'' (2003).</ref>\n\nMany groups of colonists went to the Americas searching for the right to practice their religion without [[religious persecution|persecution]]. The [[Protestant Reformation]] of the 16th century broke the unity of Western [[Christendom]] and led to the formation of numerous new religious sects, which often faced persecution by governmental authorities. In England, many people came to question the organization of the [[Church of England]] by the end of the 16th century. One of the primary manifestations of this was the [[Puritan]] movement, which sought to \"purify\" the existing Church of England of its residual Catholic rites.\n\nWaves of repression led to the migration of about 20,000 Puritans to [[New England]] between 1629 and 1642, where they founded multiple colonies. Later in the century, the new [[Pennsylvania]] colony was given to [[William Penn]] in settlement of a debt the king owed his father. Its government was established by William Penn in about 1682 to become primarily a refuge for persecuted English Quakers; but others were welcomed. Baptists, German and Swiss Protestants and [[Anabaptists]] also flocked to Pennsylvania. The lure of cheap land, religious freedom and the right to improve themselves with their own hand was very attractive.<ref>{{cite book|author=John Chester Miller|title=The First Frontier: Life in Colonial America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Oadlu2cSFUC&pg=PA80|year=1966|publisher=University Press of America|page=80|isbn=978-0-8191-4977-0}}</ref>\n\n==Forced immigration and enslavement==\n{{Main|Atlantic slave trade}}\n[[File:Tobacco cultivation (Virginia, ca. 1670).jpg|thumb|African slaves 17th-century [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]], 1670.]]\n[[Slavery]] was a common practice in the [[Americas]] prior to the arrival of Europeans, as different American Indian groups captured and held other tribes' members as slaves.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24156 |title=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica's Guide to Black History |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |accessdate=2014-02-28}}</ref> Many of these captives were forced to undergo [[human sacrifice]] in Amerindian civilizations such as the [[Aztecs]]. In response to some enslavement of natives in the [[Caribbean]] during the early years, the [[Spanish Crown]] passed a series of [[Laws of Burgos|laws prohibiting slavery]] as early as 1512. A new stricter set of laws was passed in 1542, called the ''New Laws of the Indies for the Good Treatment and Preservation of Indians'', or simply [[New Laws]].

Later, with the arrival of other European colonial powers in the New World, the enslavement of native populations increased, as these empires lacked legislation against slavery until decades later. The population of indigenous peoples declined (mostly from European diseases, but also from forced exploitation and atrocities). Later, native workers were replaced by Africans imported through a large commercial slave trade.\n\nBy the 18th century, the overwhelming number of black slaves was such that [[Amerindian]] slavery was less commonly used. Africans, who were taken aboard slave ships to the Americas, were primarily obtained from their African homelands by coastal tribes who captured and sold them.

In their paper on institutions and long-run growth, economists [[Daron Acemoglu]], [[Simon Johnson (economist)|Simon Johnson]], and [[James A. Robinson (economist)|James A.

In these regions, landowning elites were economically incentivized to develop forced labor arrangements such as the Peru [[mit'a]] system or Argentinian [[latifundias]] without regard for democratic norms. French and British colonial leaders, conversely, were incentivized to develop [[Capitalism|capitalist]] markets, [[property rights]], and [[democratic institution]]<nowiki/>s in response to [[natural environment]]<nowiki/>s that supported [[smallholder]] production over forced labor.\n\n[[James Mahony|James Mahoney]], a professor at [[Northwestern University]], proposes that colonial policy choices made at critical junctures regarding land ownership in [[coffee]]-rich Central America fostered enduring [[path dependence|path dependent]] institutions.<ref>James Mahoney, \u201cPath-Dependent Explanations of Regime Change: Central America in Comparative Perspective.\u201d Studies in Comparative International Development, 2001.</ref> Coffee economies in [[Guatemala]] and [[El Salvador]], for example, were centralized around large plantations that operated under coercive labor systems. By the 19th century, their political structures were largely authoritarian and militarized. In [[Colombia]] and [[Costa Rica]], conversely, liberal reforms were enacted at critical junctures to expand [[commercial agriculture]], and they ultimately raised the [[bargaining power]] of the middle class. Both nations eventually developed more democratic and egalitarian institutions than their highly concentrated landowning counterparts.\n\n==List of European colonies in the Americas==\n[[File:Flickr - ronsaunders47 - DOMINICAN REPUBLIC (2).jpg|thumb|[[Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic|Puerto Plata]], Dominican Republic.

Italy did exist in name, and the words \"Italy\" and \"Italians\" were commonly used at the time. See Name of Italy for more etymology --> explorer [[Christopher Columbus]] sailed west to find a new trade route to the [[Far East]] but inadvertently landed in what came to be known to Europeans as the \"[[New World]]\". He ran aground on 5 December 1492 on the northern part of [[Hispaniola]], which the [[Ta\u00edno|Taino people]] had inhabited since the 9th century; the site became the first permanent European settlement in the Americas. Western European conquest, large-scale exploration and colonization soon followed.

In the 1494 [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], ratified by the Pope, these two kingdoms divided the entire non-European world into two areas of exploration and colonization, with a north to south boundary that cut through the Atlantic Ocean and the eastern part of present-day Brazil. Based on this treaty and on early claims by Spanish explorer [[Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa]], discoverer of the [[Pacific Ocean]] in 1513, the Spanish conquered large territories in North, Central and South America.\n\nAround the late 1490s, cartographer [[Amerigo Vespucci|Americo Vespuscio]] explored the American eastern coast, on behalf of both the Portuguese and Spanish crowns, and published in 1502\u20131503, his new book ''Mundus Novus'' (''New World''), which disproved the belief that the Americas were the easternmost part of Asia and, in actuallity, an entire new world.\n\n[[File:Non-Native-American-Nations-Territorial-Claims-over-NAFTA-countries-1750-2008.gif|thumb|Territorial evolution of North America of non-native nation states from 1750 to 2008]]\n[[File:Political Evolution of Central America and the Caribbean 1700 and on.gif|thumb|Central America and Caribbean sovereignty 1700\u2013present]]\n\nSpanish conquistador [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] took over the [[Aztec Empire|Aztec Kingdom]] and [[Francisco Pizarro]] conquered the [[Inca Empire]]. As a result, by the mid-16th century, the Spanish Crown had gained control of much of western South America, and southern [[North America]], in addition to its earlier [[Caribbean]] territories. Over this same timeframe, [[History of Portugal|Portugal]] claimed lands in North America (Canada) and colonized much of eastern South America, naming it [[History of Brazil|Santa Cruz and Brazil]].\n\n[[File:Imperios Espa\u00f1ol y Portugu\u00e9s 1790.svg|thumb|Spanish and Portuguese empires in 1790.]]\n\nOther [[Europe]]an nations soon disputed the terms of the Treaty of Tordesillas. England and [[Ancien R\u00e9gime in France|France]] attempted to plant colonies in the Americas in the 16th century, but these failed. England and France succeeded in establishing permanent colonies in the following century, along with the [[Dutch Republic]]. Some of these were on Caribbean islands, which had often already been conquered by the Spanish or depopulated by disease, while others were in eastern North America, which had not been colonized by Spain north of [[History of Florida|Florida]].\n\nEarly European possessions in North America included [[Spanish Florida]], [[Spanish New Mexico]], the English colonies of [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]] (with its [[List of islands in the Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]] offshoot, [[Bermuda]]) and [[New England Colonies|New England]], the French colonies of [[Acadia]] and [[Canada, New France|Canada]], the Swedish colony of [[New Sweden]], and the Dutch [[New Netherland]]. In the 18th century, [[Denmark\u2013Norway]] revived its former colonies in [[Greenland]], while the [[Russian Empire]] gained a foothold in [[Russian America|Alaska]]. Denmark-Norway would later make several claims in the Caribbean, starting in the 1600s.\n\nAs more nations gained an interest in the colonization of the Americas, competition for territory became increasingly fierce. Colonists often faced the threat of attacks from neighboring colonies, as well as from indigenous tribes and [[Piracy in the Caribbean|pirates]].\n\n==Early state-sponsored colonists==\n[[File:RUIDIAZ(1893) 1.083 JUAN PONCE DE LE\u00d3N.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n]] ([[Santerv\u00e1s de Campos]], [[Province of Valladolid|Valladolid]], [[Spain]])]]\n{{Further|Portugal in the Age of Discovery|Spanish colonization of the Americas|First European colonization wave (15th century\u201319th century)}}\nThe first phase of well-financed European activity in the Americas began with the Atlantic Ocean crossings of Christopher Columbus (1492\u20131504), sponsored by Spain, whose original attempt was to find a new route to India and China, known as \"[[Indies|the Indies]]\". He was followed by other explorers such as [[John Cabot]], who was sponsored by England and reached Newfoundland. [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] reached Brazil and claimed it for Portugal.\n\n[[Amerigo Vespucci]], working for Portugal in voyages from 1497 to 1513, established that Columbus had reached a new set of continents. [[Cartography|Cartographers]] still use a [[Latinization (literature)|Latinized]] version of his first name, ''America'', for the two continents. Other explorers included [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]], sponsored by France in 1524; the Portuguese [[Jo\u00e3o Vaz Corte-Real]] in Newfoundland; [[Jo\u00e3o Fernandes Lavrador]], [[Gaspar Corte-Real|Gaspar]] and [[Miguel Corte-Real]] and [[Jo\u00e3o \u00c1lvares Fagundes]], in Newfoundland, Greenland, Labrador, and Nova Scotia (from 1498 to 1502, and in 1520); [[Jacques Cartier]] (1491\u20131557), [[Henry Hudson]] (1560s\u20131611), and [[Samuel de Champlain]] (1567\u20131635), who explored the region of Canada he reestablished as [[New France]].\n\nIn 1513, [[Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa]] crossed the [[Isthmus of Panama]] and led the first European expedition to see the Pacific Ocean from the [[History of the west coast of North America|west coast of the New World]]. In an action with enduring historical import, Balboa claimed the Pacific Ocean and all the lands adjoining it for the Spanish Crown. It was 1517 before another expedition, from [[Cuba]], visited Central America, [[Spanish colonization of the Yucat\u00e1n|landing on the coast of Yucat\u00e1n]] [[Slavery in the Spanish New World colonies|in search of slaves]].\n\n[[File:Iberian Union Empires2.png|thumb|Spanish and Portuguese colonies]]\nThese explorations were followed, notably in the case of Spain, by a phase of conquest: The Spaniards, having just finished the ''[[Reconquista]]'' of Spain from Muslim rule, were the first to colonize the Americas, applying the same model of governing their European holdings to their territories of the [[New World]].\n\nTen years after Columbus's discovery, the administration of [[Hispaniola]] was given to [[Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando]] of the [[Order of Alc\u00e1ntara]], founded during the ''Reconquista''. As in the [[Iberian Peninsula]], the [[Ta\u00edno people|inhabitants of Hispaniola]] were given new landmasters, while [[Roman Catholic religious order|religious orders]] handled the local administration. Progressively the ''[[encomienda]]'' system, which granted tribute (access to indigenous labor and taxation) to European settlers, was set in place.\n\nA relatively common misconception is that a small number of ''[[conquistadores]]'' conquered vast territories, aided only by disease epidemics and their powerful [[knight|caballeros]]. In fact, recent archaeological excavations have suggested a vast Spanish-Indian alliance numbering in the hundreds of thousands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ferturperu.info/discovery-the-inca-rebellion-of-1536/ |title=1536 Inca Rebellion unearthed &#124; Peruvian Travel Trends |publisher=Ferturperu.info |date=2009-09-22 |accessdate=2010-06-30}}</ref> [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] eventually [[Spanish conquest of Mexico|conquered Mexico]] with the help of [[Tlaxcala]] in 1519\u20131521, while the [[Spanish conquest of Peru|conquest of Peru]] was supported by some 40,000 Incan renegades led by [[Francisco Pizarro]] in between 1532 and 1535.\n\nOver the first century and a half after Columbus's voyages, the native population of the Americas plummeted by an estimated 80% (from around 50 million in 1492 to eight million in 1650),<ref name=Histoire/> mostly by outbreaks of [[Old World]] [[Infectious diseases|diseases]].\n\nIn 1532, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] sent a vice-king to Mexico, [[Antonio de Mendoza]], in order to prevent Cortes' independentist drives, who definitively returned to Spain in 1540. Two years later, Charles V signed the [[New Laws]] (which replaced the [[Laws of Burgos]] of 1512) prohibiting slavery and the ''[[repartimientos]]'', but also claiming as his own all the lands of the Americas and all of the indigenous people as his own subjects.\n\n[[File:Cabrera Pintura de Castas.jpg|thumb|upright|Painting depicting a [[Castas]] with his mixed-race daughter and his [[Mulatta]] wife by [[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]], 1763]]\nWhen Pope [[Alexander VI]] issued the ''[[Inter caetera]]'' bull in May 1493 granting the new lands to the [[Kingdom of Spain]], he requested in exchange an [[Roman Catholic Church and colonialism|evangelization of the people]]. Thus, during [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]]'s second voyage, [[Benedictine]] monks accompanied him, along with twelve other priests. As [[Slavery in medieval Europe|slavery]] was prohibited between Christians, and could only be imposed in non-Christian prisoners of war or on men already sold as slaves, the debate on Christianization was particularly acute during the 16th century. In 1537, the papal bull ''[[Sublimis Deus]]'' definitively recognized that Native Americans possessed souls, thus prohibiting their enslavement, without putting an end to the debate. Some claimed that a native who had rebelled and then been captured could be enslaved nonetheless.\n\nLater, two Dominican priests, [[Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas]] and the [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Juan Gin\u00e9s de Sep\u00falveda]], held the [[Valladolid debate]], with the former arguing that Native Americans were endowed with souls like all other human beings, while the latter argued to the contrary to justify their enslavement.\n\nThe process of Christianization was at first violent: when the first [[Franciscan]]s arrived in Mexico in 1524, they burned the places dedicated to pagan cult, alienating much of the local population.<ref name=Histoire2/> In the 1530s, they began to adapt Christian practices to local customs, including the building of new churches on the sites of ancient places of worship, leading to a mix of Old World Christianity with local religions.<ref name=Histoire2>\"Espagnols-Indiens: le choc des civilisations\", in ''[[L'Histoire]]'' n\u00b0322, July\u2013August 2007, pp. 14\u201321 (interview with Christian Duverger, teacher at the [[EHESS]])</ref> The [[Roman Catholicism in Spain|Spanish Roman Catholic Church]], needing the natives' labor and cooperation, evangelized in [[Quechua language|Quechua]], [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]], [[Guaran\u00ed language|Guaran\u00ed]] and other Native American languages, contributing to the expansion of these [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|indigenous languages]] and equipping some of them with writing systems. One of the first primitive schools for Native Americans was founded by Fray [[Pedro de Gante]] in 1523.\n\nTo reward their troops, the ''Conquistadores'' often allotted Indian towns to their troops and officers. Black African slaves were introduced to substitute for Native American labor in some locations\u2014including the [[West Indies]], where the indigenous population was nearing extinction on many islands.\n\nDuring this time, the Portuguese gradually switched from an initial plan of establishing trading posts to extensive [[colonization]] of what is now Brazil. They imported millions of slaves to run their plantations. The Portuguese and Spanish royal governments expected to rule these settlements and collect at least 20% of all treasure found (the ''[[quinto real]]'' collected by the ''[[Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n]]''), in addition to collecting all the taxes they could.

They were sponsored by [[common stock]] companies such as the chartered [[London Company|Virginia Company]] financed by wealthy Englishmen who exaggerated the economic potential of this new land. The main purpose of this colony was the hope of finding gold.<ref name=\"Taylor 2001\"/>\n\nIt took strong leaders, like [[John Smith of Jamestown|John Smith]], to convince the colonists of Jamestown that searching for gold was not taking care of their immediate needs for food and shelter and the [[Bible|biblical]] principle that \"he who will not work shall not eat\" (see [[2 Thessalonians 3]]). The lack of [[food security]] leading to extremely high mortality rate was quite distressing and cause for despair among the colonists. To support the Colony, numerous [[Jamestown supply missions|supply missions]] were organized. [[Tobacco]] later became a cash crop, with the work of [[John Rolfe]] and others, for export and the sustaining economic driver of [[Virginia]] and the neighboring colony of [[Maryland]].\n\nFrom the beginning of Virginia's settlements in 1587 until the 1680s, the main source of labor and a large portion of the immigrants were [[indentured servants]] looking for new life in the overseas colonies. During the 17th century, indentured servants constituted three-quarters of all European immigrants to the Chesapeake region. Most of the indentured servants were teenagers from England with poor economic prospects at home. Their fathers signed the papers that gave them free passage to America and an unpaid job until they became of age. They were given food, clothing, housing and taught farming or household skills. American landowners were in need of laborers and were willing to pay for a laborer's passage to America if they served them for several years. By selling passage for five to seven years worth of work, they could then start on their own in America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/nai_cilh/servitude.html |title=Indentured Servitude in Colonial America |first=Deanna |last=Barker |date=10 March 2004 |publisher=National Association for Interpretation, Cultural Interpretation and Living History Section |accessdate=5 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022161033/http://geocities.com/nai_cilh/servitude.html |archivedate=October 22, 2009 |df= }}</ref> Many of the migrants from England died in the first few years.<ref name=\"Taylor 2001\"/>\n\nEconomic advantage also prompted the [[Darien Scheme]], an ill-fated venture by the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] to settle the [[Isthmus of Panama]] in the late 1690s. The Darien Scheme aimed to control trade through that part of the world and thereby promote Scotland into a world trading power. However, it was doomed by poor planning, short provisions, weak leadership, lack of demand for trade goods, and devastating disease.<ref>John Prebble, ''Darien: the Scottish Dream of Empire'' (2000)</ref> The failure of the Darien Scheme was one of the factors that led the Kingdom of Scotland into the [[Act of Union 1707]] with the [[Kingdom of England]] creating the united [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and giving Scotland commercial access to English, now British, colonies.<ref>Brocklehurst, \"The Banker who Led Scotland to Disaster\".</ref>\n\nIn the French colonial regions, the focus of economy was on sugar plantations in Caribbean. In Canada the [[fur trade]] with the natives was important. About 16,000 French men and women became colonizers. The great majority became subsistence farmers along the [[St. Lawrence River]]. With a favorable disease environment and plenty of land and food, their numbers grew exponentially to 65,000 by 1760. Their colony was taken over by Britain in 1760, but social, religious, legal, cultural and economic changes were few in a society that clung tightly to its recently formed traditions.<ref>W.J.

English and Dutch colonies, on the other hand, tended to be more religiously diverse. Settlers to these colonies included [[Anglican]]s, Dutch [[Calvinists]], English [[Puritans]] and other [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformists]], [[Maryland Toleration Act|English Catholics]], Scottish [[Presbyterian]]s, French [[Huguenot]]s, German and Swedish [[Lutherans]], as well as [[Jews]], [[Quakers]], [[Mennonites]], [[Amish]], and [[Moravian Church|Moravians]].<ref>Patricia U. Bonomi, ''Under the cope of heaven: Religion, society, and politics in Colonial America'' (2003).</ref>\n\nMany groups of colonists went to the Americas searching for the right to practice their religion without [[religious persecution|persecution]]. The [[Protestant Reformation]] of the 16th century broke the unity of Western [[Christendom]] and led to the formation of numerous new religious sects, which often faced persecution by governmental authorities. In England, many people came to question the organization of the [[Church of England]] by the end of the 16th century. One of the primary manifestations of this was the [[Puritan]] movement, which sought to \"purify\" the existing Church of England of its residual Catholic rites.\n\nWaves of repression led to the migration of about 20,000 Puritans to [[New England]] between 1629 and 1642, where they founded multiple colonies. Later in the century, the new [[Pennsylvania]] colony was given to [[William Penn]] in settlement of a debt the king owed his father.

In response to some enslavement of natives in the [[Caribbean]] during the early years, the [[Spanish Crown]] passed a series of [[Laws of Burgos|laws prohibiting slavery]] as early as 1512. A new stricter set of laws was passed in 1542, called the ''New Laws of the Indies for the Good Treatment and Preservation of Indians'', or simply [[New Laws]]. These were created to prevent the exploitation of the indigenous peoples by the ''[[Encomienda|encomenderos]]'' or landowners, by strictly limiting their power and dominion.<ref>[[Joaqu\u00edn Garc\u00eda Icazbalceta|Garc\u00eda Icazbalceta, Joaqu\u00edn]] ''\"Colecci\u00f3n de documentos para la historia de M\u00e9xico\"'' \"Leyes y ordenanzas\" (Dada en la ciudad de Barcelona, a veinte d\u00edas del mes de Noviembre, a\u00f1o del nacimiento de nuestro Salvador Jesucristo de mill e quinientos e cuarenta y dos a\u00f1os) y addenda 4 de junio de 1543; 26 de junio de 1543; 26 de mayo de 1544 [http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/06922752100647273089079/p0000026.htm text on Internet] Cervantes Virtual</ref> This helped curb Indian slavery considerably, though not completely. Later, with the arrival of other European colonial powers in the New World, the enslavement of native populations increased, as these empires lacked legislation against slavery until decades later. The population of indigenous peoples declined (mostly from European diseases, but also from forced exploitation and atrocities). Later, native workers were replaced by Africans imported through a large commercial slave trade.\n\nBy the 18th century, the overwhelming number of black slaves was such that [[Amerindian]] slavery was less commonly used. Africans, who were taken aboard slave ships to the Americas, were primarily obtained from their African homelands by coastal tribes who captured and sold them. Europeans traded for slaves with the slave capturers of the local native African tribes in exchange for rum, guns, gunpowder, and other manufactures.\n\n===Slavery===\n[[File:Hakewill, A Picturesque Tour of the Island of Jamaica, Plate 04.jpg|thumb|Harbour Street, [[Kingston, Jamaica]], c. 1820]]\nThe total [[slave trade]] to islands in the [[Caribbean]], [[Brazil]], Mexico and to the United States is estimated to have involved 12 million Africans.<ref>{{cite book |first=Ronald |last=Segal |author-link=Ronald Segal |title=The Black Diaspora: Five Centuries of the Black Experience Outside Africa |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780374524906 |url-access=registration |year=1995 |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |location=New York |isbn=978-0-374-11396-4 |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780374524906/page/4 4] |quote=It is now estimated that 11,863,000 slaves were shipped across the Atlantic.
