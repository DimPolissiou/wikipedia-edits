This part of the testament was invalidated by Louis I of Hungary, however, who had traveled to [[Krak\u00f3w]] quickly after Casimir died (in 1370) and bribed the nobles with future privileges. Casimir III also had a son-in-law, [[Louis VI the Roman|Louis VI]] of Bavaria, [[Margrave]] and [[Prince-elector]] of [[Brandenburg]], who was considered a possible successor, but he was deemed ineligible as his wife, Casimir's daughter Cunigunde, had died in 1357 without issue.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://histmag.org/Kunegunda-corka-Kazimierza-Wielkiego-nieszczesliwa-panna-mloda-16829 |title=Kunegunda, c\u00f3rka Kazimierza Wielkiego: nieszcz\u0119\u015bliwa panna m\u0142oda |access-date=29 March 2020}}</ref>\n \nThus King Louis I of Hungary became successor in Poland.

He introduced the codes of law of Greater and Lesser Poland as an attempt to end the overwhelming superiority of the nobility. During his reign all three major classes \u2014 the nobility, priesthood, and bourgeoisie \u2014 were more or less counterbalanced, allowing Casimir to strengthen his monarchic position. He was known for siding with the weak when the law did not protect them from nobles and clergymen.

Queen Adelaide renounced it as [[Polygamy|bigamous]] and returned to Hesse without permission. Casimir continued living with Christine despite complaints by [[Pope Innocent VI]] on behalf of Queen Adelaide. The marriage lasted until 1363\u201364 when Casimir again declared himself divorced.

He introduced the codes of law of Greater and Lesser Poland as an attempt to end the overwhelming superiority of the nobility. During his reign all three major classes \u2014 the nobility, priesthood, and bourgeoisie \u2014 were more or less counterbalanced, allowing Casimir to strengthen his monarchic position. He was known for siding with the weak when the law did not protect them from nobles and clergymen.

It is usually very plentiful at a site and the details of manufacture and decoration are very sensitive indicators of time, space and culture.<ref name=\"Shepard\">{{cite book |last1=Shepard |first1=Anna O. |title=Ceramics for the Archaeologist |date=1954 |publisher=Carnegie Institution of Washington, Publication 609 |location=Washington, D.C.}}</ref>\n\nThe Huber site is the type site for an [[Upper Mississippian]] culture known for its distinctive shell-[[Temper (pottery)|tempered]] pottery.  Although the Huber tradition was well known by archaeologists for decades following the original excavations, a formalized [[Typology (archaeology)|typology]] was not developed until Charles Faulkner devised one in his 1972 report on the [[Griesmer Site|Griesmer]] site in northwestern Indiana, just to the east of [[Chicago]].<ref name=\"Faulkner\">{{cite journal |last1=Faulkner |first1=Charles H. |title=The Late Prehistoric Occupation of Northwestern Indiana: A Study of the Upper Mississippi Cultures of the Kankakee Valley |journal=Prehistory Research Series |date=1972 |volume=V |issue=1 |pages=1\u2013222 |publisher=Indiana Historical Society |location=Indianapolis, Indiana}}</ref>\n\nHuber pottery is characterized by shell-[[Temper (pottery)|tempered]], smooth surface pots with globular vessel shape and restricted orifices with everted rims.  Some vessels also have strap handles.  Decoration (when present) usually consists of vertical or obliquely applied incised or trailed lines generally running from the lip to the shoulder.  Rarely, surfaces are [[Cord-marked pottery|cordmarked]] or smoothed-over cordmarked.  The top of the lip is either plain or decorated with fine to wide notching.  A minority also have punctate decoration, usually in combination with the trailed lines.<ref name=\"Bettarel\">{{cite book |last1=Bettarel |first1=Robert Louis |last2=Smith |first2=Hale G. |title=The Moccasin Bluff Site and the Woodland Cultures of Southwestern Michigan |date=1973 |publisher=University of Michigan Museum of Anthropology, Anthropological Papers No. 49 |location=Ann Arbor, Michigan}}</ref><ref name=\"Mason\"/><ref name=\"Herold\"/><ref name=\"Faulkner\"/>\n\n18 different rim profile types were identified but almost all of them are everted, mostly sharply everted.  The most common are everted with square lip; everted with the lip thickened on either the inside or outside; and everted with pointed lip.  Almost half of the lips are unnotched.  Of the body sherds showing incised lines, there were more fine-line incised lines than either medium- or wide-line.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\nFollowing Faulkner's typology,<ref name=\"Faulkner\"/> this is the proportion of the pottery types at the site:<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\n* Huber Plain - 82%, characterized by a plain surface \n* Huber Trailed - 9%, characterized by a plain surface decorated with fine incised lines\n* Huber Bold - 5%, characterized by a plain surface decorated with wide lines, possibly finger-trailed\n* Huber Cordmarked - 1%, characterized by a cordmarked surface\n* Fisher - less than 1% of the pottery was identified as belonging to the Fisher tradition, another [[Upper Mississippian]] culture which existed in the southern [[Lake Michigan]] region and was at least partially coterminous with Huber. Fisher pottery is characterized by shell-tempering and predominantly cordmarked surfaces, often decorated with curvilinear designs.<ref name=\"Mason\"/>\n* Other types - 2.5%\n\n== Chronology of Huber pottery within the Huber sequence ==\n\nThe trends in certain pottery traits are very time-sensitive and can be used as indicators of relative age.  Based on information on other Huber sites in the area, archaeologists have determined early Huber pottery is more likely to have cordmarked surface finish; wide-trailed decoration; and notched lips.  Late Huber pottery has predominately smooth surface finish; fine-line incised decoration; and unnotched lips.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\nTemporal trends may be seen by a comparison to the nearby [[Hoxie Farm Site|Hoxie Farm site]].  The pottery from the Huber site assemblage overwhelmingly has smooth surface with only 1% of sherds cordmarked; in contrast, Hoxie Farm's pottery was 23.5% cordmarked.  45% of incised decoration was fine-line incised, compared to 13% at Hoxie Farm.  Also, almost 50% of lips are unnotched, compared to only 20% at Hoxie Farm.  This indicates the Huber Site assemblage dates to a later time period than Hoxie Farm.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\n== Huber within the Upper Mississippian Culture ==\n\nHuber ware (and Huber culture) are often mentioned together with Fisher.  Both Fisher and Huber are Upper Mississippian cultures which existed in the southern Lake Michigan region in the states of northern Illinois and Indiana and southwest Michigan.  Both have shell-tempered pottery but Huber is predominantly plain surface with fine-line decoration and Fisher is predominantly cordmarked surface with wide-line decoration.<ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Bettarel\"/><ref name=\"Brown1\">{{cite book |last1=Brown |first1=James A. |last2=Asch |first2=David L. |editor1-last=Brown |editor1-first=James A. |editor2-last=O'Brien |editor2-first=Patricia J. |title=The Oak Forest Site: Investigations into Oneota Subsistence-Settlement in the Cal-Sag Area of Cook County, Illinois, IN At the Edge of Prehistory: Huber Phase Archaeology in the Chicago Area |date=1990 |publisher=Center for American Archaeology |location=Kampsville, Illinois |chapter=Chapter 4: Cultural Setting: the Oneota Tradition}}</ref>\n\nThe relationship of Huber and Fisher both with each other and with other Upper Mississippian cultures in the area has long been a matter of debate and speculation among archaeologists.  James Griffin, upon examining the artifacts from the original 1929 excavations, felt that Huber was a Component of the Oneota Aspect based on the form and design of the pottery, close to the Orr and Lake Winnebago foci, and that Fisher was part of a separate Focus.<ref name=\"Griffin\"/>  Since that date, we\u2019ve obtained a great deal more information and now we know that Fisher is the older of the two and Huber is the only one that has been found in association with early Historic European trade goods. Nevertheless, both Fisher and Huber coexist at the same sites seemingly at the same time.  Hoxie Farm, Griesmer and Moccasin Bluff are examples of this.<ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Herold\"/><ref name=\"Brown1\"/><ref name=\"Bettarel\"/>\n\nMost archaeologists now believe that both Fisher and Huber are taxonomically-related phases within the Oneota tradition.  The relationship between the two is time-related in that Huber is derived from Fisher; but there are also late Fisher sites like Fifield, where Fisher pottery is associated with late Prehistoric artifacts, so it is possible that Fisher also survived until the Protohistoric or early Historic period.<ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Brown1\"/><ref name=\"Bettarel\"/>\n\n== Significance ==\n\nThe Huber site has had an outsized influence in [[Archaeology|archaeological]] circles, especially in the [[American Midwest]], as the namesake of an [[Upper Mississippian]] culture.  Several of the artifacts are also noteworthy:\n\nSeveral items of personal adornment and domestic utility were found here, and provide a glimpse into daily life; such as hair accessories, bracelets, pendants, and hoes made of bison and elk scapulas.  A bone or antler dice implies games or [[gambling]] went on at the site.

It is usually very plentiful at a site and the details of manufacture and decoration are very sensitive indicators of time, space and culture.<ref name=\"Shepard\">{{cite book |last1=Shepard |first1=Anna O. |title=Ceramics for the Archaeologist |date=1954 |publisher=Carnegie Institution of Washington, Publication 609 |location=Washington, D.C.}}</ref>\n\nThe Huber site is the type site for an [[Upper Mississippian]] culture known for its distinctive shell-[[Temper (pottery)|tempered]] pottery.  Although the Huber tradition was well known by archaeologists for decades following the original excavations, a formalized [[Typology (archaeology)|typology]] was not developed until Charles Faulkner devised one in his 1972 report on the [[Griesmer Site|Griesmer]] site in northwestern Indiana, just to the east of [[Chicago]].<ref name=\"Faulkner\">{{cite journal |last1=Faulkner |first1=Charles H. |title=The Late Prehistoric Occupation of Northwestern Indiana: A Study of the Upper Mississippi Cultures of the Kankakee Valley |journal=Prehistory Research Series |date=1972 |volume=V |issue=1 |pages=1\u2013222 |publisher=Indiana Historical Society |location=Indianapolis, Indiana}}</ref>\n\nHuber pottery is characterized by shell-[[Temper (pottery)|tempered]], smooth surface pots with globular vessel shape and restricted orifices with everted rims.  Some vessels also have strap handles.  Decoration (when present) usually consists of vertical or obliquely applied incised or trailed lines generally running from the lip to the shoulder.  Rarely, surfaces are [[Cord-marked pottery|cordmarked]] or smoothed-over cordmarked.  The top of the lip is either plain or decorated with fine to wide notching.  A minority also have punctate decoration, usually in combination with the trailed lines.<ref name=\"Bettarel\">{{cite book |last1=Bettarel |first1=Robert Louis |last2=Smith |first2=Hale G. |title=The Moccasin Bluff Site and the Woodland Cultures of Southwestern Michigan |date=1973 |publisher=University of Michigan Museum of Anthropology, Anthropological Papers No. 49 |location=Ann Arbor, Michigan}}</ref><ref name=\"Mason\"/><ref name=\"Herold\"/><ref name=\"Faulkner\"/>\n\n18 different rim profile types were identified but almost all of them are everted, mostly sharply everted.  The most common are everted with square lip; everted with the lip thickened on either the inside or outside; and everted with pointed lip.  Almost half of the lips are unnotched.  Of the body sherds showing incised lines, there were more fine-line incised lines than either medium- or wide-line.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\nFollowing Faulkner's typology,<ref name=\"Faulkner\"/> this is the proportion of the pottery types at the site:<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\n* Huber Plain - 82%, characterized by a plain surface \n* Huber Trailed - 9%, characterized by a plain surface decorated with fine incised lines\n* Huber Bold - 5%, characterized by a plain surface decorated with wide lines, possibly finger-trailed\n* Huber Cordmarked - 1%, characterized by a cordmarked surface\n* Fisher - less than 1% of the pottery was identified as belonging to the Fisher tradition, another [[Upper Mississippian]] culture which existed in the southern [[Lake Michigan]] region and was at least partially coterminous with Huber. Fisher pottery is characterized by shell-tempering and predominantly cordmarked surfaces, often decorated with curvilinear designs.<ref name=\"Mason\"/>\n* Other types - 2.5%\n\n== Chronology of Huber pottery within the Huber sequence ==\n\nThe trends in certain pottery traits are very time-sensitive and can be used as indicators of relative age.  Based on information on other Huber sites in the area, archaeologists have determined early Huber pottery is more likely to have cordmarked surface finish; wide-trailed decoration; and notched lips.  Late Huber pottery has predominately smooth surface finish; fine-line incised decoration; and unnotched lips.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\nTemporal trends may be seen by a comparison to the nearby [[Hoxie Farm Site|Hoxie Farm site]].  The pottery from the Huber site assemblage overwhelmingly has smooth surface with only 1% of sherds cordmarked; in contrast, Hoxie Farm's pottery was 23.5% cordmarked.  45% of incised decoration was fine-line incised, compared to 13% at Hoxie Farm.  Also, almost 50% of lips are unnotched, compared to only 20% at Hoxie Farm.  This indicates the Huber Site assemblage dates to a later time period than Hoxie Farm.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\n== Huber within the Upper Mississippian Culture ==\n\nHuber ware (and Huber culture) are often mentioned together with Fisher.  Both Fisher and Huber are Upper Mississippian cultures which existed in the southern Lake Michigan region in the states of northern Illinois and Indiana and southwest Michigan.  Both have shell-tempered pottery but Huber is predominantly plain surface with fine-line decoration and Fisher is predominantly cordmarked surface with wide-line decoration.<ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Bettarel\"/><ref name=\"Brown1\">{{cite book |last1=Brown |first1=James A. |last2=Asch |first2=David L. |editor1-last=Brown |editor1-first=James A. |editor2-last=O'Brien |editor2-first=Patricia J. |title=The Oak Forest Site: Investigations into Oneota Subsistence-Settlement in the Cal-Sag Area of Cook County, Illinois, IN At the Edge of Prehistory: Huber Phase Archaeology in the Chicago Area |date=1990 |publisher=Center for American Archaeology |location=Kampsville, Illinois |chapter=Chapter 4: Cultural Setting: the Oneota Tradition}}</ref>\n\nThe relationship of Huber and Fisher both with each other and with other Upper Mississippian cultures in the area has long been a matter of debate and speculation among archaeologists.  James Griffin, upon examining the artifacts from the original 1929 excavations, felt that Huber was a Component of the Oneota Aspect based on the form and design of the pottery, close to the Orr and Lake Winnebago foci, and that Fisher was part of a separate Focus.<ref name=\"Griffin\"/>  Since that date, we\u2019ve obtained a great deal more information and now we know that Fisher is the older of the two and Huber is the one that survived to the Historic period.  Nevertheless, both Fisher and Huber coexist at the same sites seemingly at the same time.  Hoxie Farm, Griesmer and Moccasin Bluff are examples of this.<ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Herold\"/><ref name=\"Brown1\"/><ref name=\"Bettarel\"/>\n\nMost archaeologists now believe that both Fisher and Huber are taxonomically-related phases within the Oneota tradition.  The relationship between the two is time-related in that Huber is derived from Fisher; but there are also late Fisher sites like Fifield, where Fisher pottery is associated with late Prehistoric artifacts, so it is possible that Fisher also survived until the Protohistoric or early Historic period.<ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Brown1\"/><ref name=\"Bettarel\"/>\n\n== Significance ==\n\nThe Huber site has had an outsized influence in [[Archaeology|archaeological]] circles, especially in the [[American Midwest]], as the namesake of an [[Upper Mississippian]] culture.  Several of the artifacts are also noteworthy:\n\nSeveral items of personal adornment and domestic utility were found here, and provide a glimpse into daily life; such as hair accessories, bracelets, pendants, and hoes made of bison and elk scapulas.  A bone or antler dice implies games or [[gambling]] went on at the site.  A bone rasp indicates music was being performed for entertainment or for [[Ceremony|ceremonial]] purposes.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\nThere was no direct evidence of cultivated plants at Huber, but that is probably due to the fact that plant remains were not systematically collected during excavations.  The fact that there are hoes made of bison scapula and elk scapula is indirect evidence of [[Agriculture|agricultural]] activities.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>  Furthermore, cultivated corn remains have been found at other Huber sites such as Hoxie Farm, so there is no doubt the Huber society was agriculturally based.<ref name=\"Cutler\">{{cite book |last1=Cutler |first1=Hugh C. |last2=Blake |first2=Leonard W. |editor1-last=Brown |editor1-first=James A. |editor2-last=O'Brien |editor2-first=Patricia |title=Hoxie Farm and Huber: Two Upper Mississippian Sites in Cook County, Illinois, IN At the Edge of Prehistory: Huber Phase Archaeology in the Chicago Area |date=1990 |publisher=Center for American Archaeology |location=Kampsville, Illinois |chapter=Appendix 6: The Hoxie Farm Site Corn Remains}}</ref>\n\nBased on the type of animal bone present, and the presence of agricultural implements such as the scapula hoes, the researchers felt that the site was occupied at least from spring through fall.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\nThe engraved pebbles found at Huber are an indication of the [[Native American|Native Americans]] [[Native American religion|belief]] in the spirit world.
