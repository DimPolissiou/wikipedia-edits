Formed on 18 May 1882, the team originally played only [[exhibition match|friendly matches]] until they entered the [[FA Cup]] for the first time in 1885.<ref>Simpson (2007), p. 25</ref> Burnley went on to become one of the 12 founding members of [[the Football League]] in 1888 and have competed in that league, with the exception of [[2009\u201310 Burnley F.C. season|2009\u201310]] and [[2014\u201315 Burnley F.C. season|2014\u201315]] and have played in the [[Premier League]] since the [[2016\u201317 Burnley F.C. season|2016\u201317]] season.

The only decade that Burnley didn't have an international representative was during the 1990s. From the 2000s onwards the increasingly multinational nature of the team resulted in call-ups for players from across Europe (including [[Greece national football team|Greece]] and [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]]) and also from the wider world (including [[New Zealand national football team|New Zealand]], [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] and [[Canada men's national soccer team|Canada]]).

Formed on 18 May 1882, the team originally played only [[exhibition match|friendly matches]] until they entered the [[FA Cup]] for the first time in 1885.<ref>Simpson (2007), p. 25</ref> Burnley went on to become one of the 12 founding members of [[the Football League]] in 1888 and have competed in that league, with the exception of [[2009\u201310 Burnley F.C. season|2009\u201310]] and [[2014\u201315 Burnley F.C. season|2014\u201315]] and have played in the [[Premier League]] since the [[2016\u201317 Burnley F.C. season|2016\u201317]] season. The following list contains all footballers who have represented their country at full international level whilst being a Burnley player.\n\n==Introduction==\nBurnley's first international was [[Forward (association football)|forward]] [[John Yates (footballer, born 1861)|John Yates]] who appeared for [[England national football team|England]] on 2 March 1889, in a 6&ndash;1 victory over [[Ireland national football team (1882\u20131950)|Ireland]] in the [[1888\u201389 British Home Championship]]. Yates scored a [[hat-trick]] on his debut, in what proved to be his only cap.<ref name=\"Jack Yates\"/> [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Irish]] forward [[Jimmy McIlroy]] is Burnley's most capped player, appearing in 51 games for his country between 1951 and 1962.<ref name=\"Jimmy McIlroy\" />  McIlroy is also the club's top international goalscorer, netting 10 times for Northern Ireland during his tenure with the Clarets.<ref name=\"Jimmy McIlroy\" /> Attacking [[midfielder]] [[Cameron Howieson]] became Burnley's youngest ever international in 2012 at the age of 17, making his debut for [[New Zealand national football team|New Zealand]] in a 2&ndash;2 draw with [[El Salvador national football team|El Salvador]].<ref name=\"Cameron Howieson\"/>\n\nThe majority of Burnley players that have received international caps are for the [[Home Nations|home nations]] ([[England national football team|England]], [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], [[Wales national football team|Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]]). The only decade that Burnley didn't have an international representative was during the 1990s. From the 2000s onwards the increasingly multinational nature of the team resulted in call-ups for players from across Europe (including [[Greece national football team|Greece]] and [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]]) and also from the wider world (including [[New Zealand national football team|New Zealand]], [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] and [[Canada men's national soccer team|Canada]]).

At the intersection of these two roads (present day Clayton Hall Road and Snickersville Turnpike) a small community began to develop, centered around the home of [[William Clayton (burgess)|William Clayton]], Clayton Hall, and the dependencies he built for his farm at the gap.  The settlement was christened Snickers' Gap in 1807 when a post office was established there.\n\nSeventeen years later, in 1826, the town was incorporated by the General Assembly as '''Snickersville''', though it would take another six years for the post office there to change its name. The completion of the Leesburg and Snickers Gap Turnpike in 1832 (present day [[Virginia State Highway 7]]) brought new prosperity and prestige to the community, and the last major growth it would see for the next half-century.  Despite the strategic importance of Snickers' Gap during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Snickersville saw surprisingly little action save the coming and going of the armies through the gap.  The only major action in the town was one of eight small partisan skirmishes in the area which took place May 23, 1864, when 14 [[Confederate States Army|Confederates]] surprised and routed 22 Federals resting in the town.\n\nIn 1875, the Washington and Ohio Railroad, which began in [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], was extended to Round Hill. The lure of the Blue Ridge some four miles west prompted a livery service to run from Snickersville to Round Hill to pick up travelers and take to them to one of the several hotels that began to spring up in and about the town.  In 1900, the success of the resorts in the vicinity of Snickersville, including [[Jules DeMonet]]'s Blue Ridge Inn at Bear's Den, prompted the [[Southern Railway (U.S.)|Southern Railway]] (which had acquired the Washington & Ohio's route) to extend its tracks to the town, which became the final western terminus of line.<ref>{{cite web|first=Susan Freis|last=Falknor|date=March 11, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190624110019/http://bluemontva.org/historyarticle20080311_3.html|archivedate=June 24, 2019|url=http://bluemontva.org/historyarticle20080311_3.html|title=History of Bluemont - Railroad days|work=Welcome to Bluemont: Articles|location=Bluemont, Virginia|publisher=Bluemont Citizens Association|accessdate=January 19, 2020}}</ref> The extension permitted the steam railroad's passengers to travel to the base of the Blue Ridge from a terminal in [[Washington, D.C.]]\n\nTo promote the resort nature of the town, the railroad petitioned the [[United States Postal Service]] to change the name of the town to '''Bluemont'''.  The Postal Service acquiesced to this request on September 7, 1900.  The zenith of the town came in 1908, when its population peaked at 200.\n\nIn 1912, [[interurban|interurban electric trolleys]] of the new [[Washington and Old Dominion Railroad|Washington and Old Dominion Railway]] began to serve Bluemont on the Southern Railway's former steam route. However, with the advent of the [[automobile]], the town's rail-based tourism began to decline. In 1939, deteriorating conditions on a trestle immediately east of Round Hill, combined with a lack of rail traffic, led to the abandonment of the line between [[Purcellville, Virginia|Purcellville]]  and Bluemont.\n\nBy the 1940s Bluemont had become a sleepy community of about 140 inhabitants.  Still its scenic location continued to be a lure, especially artists and musicians, including artist [[Clyde Beck]], who with Evelyn Johnson, founded the Bluemont Citizens Association and the annual Bluemont Fair in 1968.  Around the same time the commune of Skyfields was established by local musicians Howard Bass and Peter Dunning.  From the commune and the musicians it attracted was founded the Bluemont Concert Series in the 1970s.\n\nIn 1984, the [[Bluemont Historic District]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref>[http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Counties/Loudoun/404-0012_Bluemont_Historic_District_1984_Final_Nomination.pdf National Register of Historic Places nomination form for Bluemont Historic District] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115155726/http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Counties/Loudoun/404-0012_Bluemont_Historic_District_1984_Final_Nomination.pdf |date=January 15, 2009 }} ''in'' [http://www.dhr.virginia.gov official website of the Virginia Department of Historic Resources] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115144027/http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/ |date=January 15, 2009 }} Retrieved Oct 29, 2008.</ref><ref>[http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/RegisterMasterList.pdf List of Virginia properties on National Register of Historic Places] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170627142023/http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/registermasterlist.pdf# |date=June 27, 2017 }} ''in'' [http://www.dhr.virginia.gov official website of the Virginia Department of Historic Resources] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115144027/http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/ |date=January 15, 2009 }} Retrieved October 29, 2008.</ref>  A historic marker at the intersection of Clayton Hall Road and Snickersville Turnpike identifies the location of the Historic District, which is a Virginia Historic Landmark.<ref>[http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=4023 Bluemont Historic District marker] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327074212/http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=4023 |date=March 27, 2012 }} ''in'' [http://www.hmdb.org HMdb.org: The Historical Marker Database] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303154048/http://www.hmdb.org/ |date=March 3, 2011 }} Retrieved October 29, 2008.</ref>  The [[Bear's Den Rural Historic District]] was listed in 2008.<ref name=\"nris\">[https://npgallery.nps.gov/NRHP/AssetDetail?assetID=7ec1d0fb-48a7-47e9-a326-8070cd8c24d7 National Register of Historic Places Digital Archive on NPGallery: Bears Den Historic District] Retrieved January 19, 2020.</ref>\n\nThe Bluemont ZIP code (20135) encompasses parts of three counties and two states (Loudoun County, Virginia; [[Clarke County, Virginia]]; and [[Jefferson County, West Virginia]]).\n\n===Bluemont Fair===\nThe Bluemont Fair is held annually on the third weekend in September.

Ross Robertson Cup]], defeating the [[Ottawa 67's]].\n\n==Expansion==\n===Toronto St. Michael's Majors===\nOn August 15, 1996, the [[Ontario Hockey League]] announced that the [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]] would join the league as an expansion team, beginning in the 1997-98 season. The Majors would play their home games at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]], in which they shared the arena with the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] of the [[National Hockey League]]. The Majors would join the East Division.\n\nPreviously, the Toronto St. Michael's Majors were a junior hockey franchise from 1906-1962, as they ceased operations at the conclusion of the 1961-62 season. The Majors won the [[Memorial Cup]] in [[1934 Memorial Cup|1934]], [[1945 Memorial Cup|1945]], [[1947 Memorial Cup|1947]] and [[1961 Memorial Cup|1961]].\n\nThe Majors were the first OHL franchise based out of [[Toronto, Ontario|Toronto]] in eight years, as their previous franchise, the [[Toronto Marlboros]], relocated to [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] following the [[1988-89 OHL season|1988-89]] season.\n\n==Rebranding==\n===Detroit Whalers to Plymouth Whalers===\nThe [[Detroit Whalers]] rebranded their team as the [[Plymouth Whalers]] during the summer of 1997. The Whalers franchise moved to the [[Compuware Sports Arena]] in [[1996-97 OHL season|1996-97]], which is located in [[Plymouth, Michigan|Plymouth]]. The team would retain their current team name and uniforms.\n\n==Realignment==\nThe newest [[Ontario Hockey League]] club, the [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]], joined the East Division. Due to the Majors joining the East, the OHL moved the [[North Bay Centennials]] from the East Division to the Central Division, while the [[Erie Otters]] moved from the Central Division to the West Division. This created three six-team divisions in the 18 team league.\n\n==Regular Season==\n===Final standings===\n''Note: DIV = Division; GP = Games played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; OTL = Overtime Losses; GF = Goals For; GA = Goals Against; PTS = Points; x = clinched playoff berth; y = clinched division title; z = earned first round bye''\n\n=== East Division ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! width=\"7.5%\"| Rank\n! width=\"25.5%\"| Team\n! width=\"7.5%\"| GP\n! width=\"7.5%\"| W\n! width=\"7.5%\"| L\n! width=\"7.5%\"| T\n! width=\"7.5%\"| PTS\n! width=\"7.5%\"| GF\n! width=\"7.5%\"| GA\n|-\n| 1 || align=left| z-[[Ottawa 67's]] || 66 || 40 || 17 || 9 || '''89''' || 286 || 172\n|-\n| 2 || align=left| x-[[Belleville Bulls]] || 66 || 41 || 22 || 3 || '''85''' || 315 || 239\n|-\n| 3 || align=left| x-[[Kingston Frontenacs]] || 66 || 35 || 27 || 4 || '''74''' || 330 || 275\n|-\n| 4 || align=left| x-[[Oshawa Generals]] || 66 || 26 || 32 || 8 || '''60''' || 214 || 247\n|-\n| 5 || align=left| x-[[Peterborough Petes]] || 66 || 20 || 36 || 10 || '''50''' || 212 || 273\n|- style=\"background-color:#cccccc;\"\n| || || || || || || || ||\n|-\n| 6 || align=left| [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]] || 66 || 15 || 42 || 9 || '''39''' || 154 || 265\n|}\n\n=== Central Division ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! width=\"7.5%\"| Rank\n! width=\"25.5%\"| Team\n! width=\"7.5%\"| GP\n! width=\"7.5%\"| W\n! width=\"7.5%\"| L\n! width=\"7.5%\"| T\n! width=\"7.5%\"| PTS\n! width=\"7.5%\"| GF\n! width=\"7.5%\"| GA\n|-\n| 1 || align=left| z-[[Guelph Storm]] || 66 || 42 || 18 || 6 || '''90''' || 263 || 189\n|-\n| 2 || align=left| x-[[Barrie Colts]] || 66 || 38 || 23 || 5 || '''81''' || 236 || 215\n|-\n| 3 || align=left| x-[[Kitchener Rangers]] || 66 || 27 || 29 || 10 || '''64''' || 224 || 239\n|-\n| 4 || align=left| x-[[Owen Sound Platers]] || 66 || 27 || 34 || 5 || '''59''' || 270 || 312\n|-\n| 5 || align=left| x-[[Sudbury Wolves]] || 66 || 25 || 34 || 7 || '''57''' || 257 || 268\n|- style=\"background-color:#cccccc;\"\n| || || || || || || || ||\n|-\n| 6 || align=left| [[North Bay Centennials]] || 66 || 15 || 45 || 6 || '''36''' || 213 || 291\n|}\n\n=== West Division ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! width=\"7.5%\"| Rank\n! width=\"25.5%\"| Team\n! width=\"7.5%\"| GP\n! width=\"7.5%\"| W\n! width=\"7.5%\"| L\n! width=\"7.5%\"| T\n! width=\"7.5%\"| PTS\n! width=\"7.5%\"| GF\n! width=\"7.5%\"| GA\n|-\n| 1 || align=left| y-[[London Knights]] || 66 || 40 || 21 || 5 || '''85''' || 301 || 238\n|-\n| 2 || align=left| x-[[Plymouth Whalers]] || 66 || 37 || 22 || 7 || '''81''' || 279 || 223\n|-\n| 3 || align=left| x-[[Sarnia Sting]] || 66 || 32 || 21 || 13 || '''77''' || 253 || 227\n|-\n| 4 || align=left| x-[[Erie Otters]] || 66 || 33 || 28 || 5 || '''71''' || 261 || 252\n|- style=\"background-color:#cccccc;\"\n| || || || || || || || ||\n|-\n| 5 || align=left| [[Sault Ste.

The [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]] name was reactivated when they are awarded a franchise, to play in the east division. The [[Detroit Whalers]] became the [[Plymouth Whalers]]. Eighteen teams each played 66 games. The [[Guelph Storm]] won the [[J. Ross Robertson Cup]], defeating the [[Ottawa 67's]].\n\n==Expansion==\n===Toronto St. Michael's Majors===\nOn August 15, 1996, the [[Ontario Hockey League]] announced that the [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]] would join the league as an expansion team, beginning in the 1997-98 season. The Majors would play their home games at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]], in which they shared the arena with the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] of the [[National Hockey League]]. The Majors would join the East Division.\n\nPreviously, the Toronto St. Michael's Majors were a junior hockey franchise from 1906-1962, as they ceased operations at the conclusion of the 1961-62 season. The Majors won the [[Memorial Cup]] in [[1934 Memorial Cup|1934]], [[1945 Memorial Cup|1945]], [[1947 Memorial Cup|1947]] and [[1961 Memorial Cup|1961]].\n\nThe Majors were the first OHL franchise based out of [[Toronto, Ontario|Toronto]] in eight years, as their previous franchise, the [[Toronto Marlboros]], relocated to [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] following the [[1988-89 OHL season|1988-89]] season.\n\n==Rebranding==\n===Detroit Whalers to Plymouth Whalers===\nThe [[Detroit Whalers]] rebranded their team as the [[Plymouth Whalers]] during the summer of 1997. The Whalers franchise moved to the [[Compuware Sports Arena]] in [[1996-97 OHL season|1996-97]], which is located in [[Plymouth, Michigan|Plymouth]]. The team would retain their current team name and uniforms.\n\n==Realignment==\nThe newest [[Ontario Hockey League]] club, the [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]], joined the East Division.

Slauerhoff''', was a Dutch poet and novelist. He is considered one of the most important [[Dutch language]] writers.\n\n==Youth==\nSlauerhoff attended [[Hogereburgerschool|HBS]] (secondary school) in [[Harlingen, Netherlands|Harlingen]], where he first met fellow future writer [[Simon Vestdijk]]. In 1916, Slauerhoff moved to [[Amsterdam]] to read medicine. While at the university, he wrote his first poems; his debut as a poet was in the Communist magazine ''[[De Nieuwe Tijd]]''. He edited the Amsterdam student magazine ''[[Propria Cures]]'' from 1919 to 1920.<ref name=\"stuiveling\"/> In 1919, Slauerhoff became engaged to a Dutch language student, Truus de Ruyter.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} In 1921 he joined the staff of the literary magazine ''[[Het Getij]]'' and later that of ''[[De Vrije Bladen]]''; in this period he became acquainted with poets [[Hendrik Marsman]] and [[Hendrik de Vries]].<ref name=\"stuiveling\"/>\n\n==Early career==\nHis first collection of verse, ''Archipel'' (\"Archipelago\"), was published in 1923.<ref name=\"stuiveling\"/> Afterwards, he started working as a medical doctor on board of ships, especially in South East Asia. Much of his work refers to travel, to longing for far coasts, to China and Japan, and to the sea.\n\n==Marriage, final years==\n[[File:Slauerhoff4.jpg|thumb|Slauerhoff wearing Chinese attire (Coll. Letterkundig Museum)]]\nHis fame as a writer, meanwhile, spread. In 1932 he published ''Het verboden rijk'' (\"The Forbidden Kingdom\"), a partly [[historical novel|historical]], partly [[magical realist]] novel combining the life of a 20th-century European with that of [[Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es]], the 16th-century Portuguese poet (author of sonnets and the epic ''[[Os Lus\u00edadas|The Lusiads]]'') who spent part of his life in the Orient.<ref name=laan/> Despite not being translated into English until 2012,<ref>{{cite book  | last = Slauerhoff  | first = Jacob  | title = The Forbidden Kingdom  | publisher = Pushkin Press  | location = London  | year = 2012}}</ref> it attracted attention from scholars publishing in English, Jane Fenoulhet, for instance, referring to it as an important modernist novel in 2001.<ref>{{cite journal  | last = Fenoulhet  | first = Jane  | title = Time Travel in the Forbidden Realm: J.

Slauerhoff}}</ref>\n\n==Style and themes==\nThough Slauerhoff writes in the time of [[expressionism]], his poetry is, according to Garmt Stuiveling and G.J. van Bork, essentially [[Romanticism|romantic]]: strongly autobiographical, it evidences restlessness, imagination, and a longing for faraway places, expressed through an identification with tramps, discoverers, and pirates.<ref name=\"stuiveling\">{{cite book|last1=Stuiveling|first1=Garmt|last2=Bork|first2=G.J. van|editor=G.J. van Bork, P.J.

A performance of his play ''Jan Pietersz. Coen'' (1930), highly critical of [[Jan Pieterszoon Coen]] (seventeenth-century officer of the [[Dutch East India Company in Indonesia]] and two-term [[Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies]]), was prohibited by the mayor of Amsterdam in 1948.<ref name=laan/>\n\n==Posthumous editions==\n[[File:J.J. Slauerhoff - 'T ZWERK ligt teneergeslagen - Utrechtse Jaagpad 3, Leiden.JPG|thumb|Poem by Slauerhoff on a [[Wall poems in Leiden|wall in Leiden]] ]]\nTwo works in progress that were nearly finished at the time of Slauerhoff's death, the original novel ''De opstand van Guadalajara'' (\"The [[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara]] Uprising\") and the translation of [[Mart\u00edn Luis Guzm\u00e1n]]'s novel ''In de schaduw van den leider'' (\"In the Shadow of the Leader\"), were published [[posthumous work|posthumous]]ly in 1937.\n\nA Committee for the Preparation of Slauerhoff's Complete Works was put together and convened to compile his ''Complete Works''. This Committee, which consisted of leading literary figures, among which a number of friends of Slauerhoff, included [[D.A.M. Binnendijk]], [[Menno ter Braak]], [[N.A. Donkersloot]], [[J. Greshoff]], [[Kees Lekkerkerker]], [[Hendrik Marsman]], [[Adriaan Roland Holst]], and [[Constant van Wessem]]. Du Perron contributed a general outline for the ordering and grouping of the contents, but declined to participate further. Work progressed slowly and was further slowed down by the events of [[World War II]]. The first volume appeared in 1941, one year behind schedule, and the series of eight volumes was not completed until 1958. Two of the Committee's members, Ter Braak and Marsman, died at the start of the war and the publisher, [[Nijgh & Van Ditmar]], lost faith halfway through the project, which resulted in the intended separate volume of [[critical apparatus]] being scrapped and the last volume, containing Slauerhoff's essays, being published independently by Lekkerkerker.\nLekkerkerker, ever the dedicated text researcher and caretaker of Slauerhoff's literary heritage, continued over the years to unearth and study Slauerhoff's [[manuscript]]s and uncollected publications, resulting in ever better versions of the ''Complete Poems'' and ''Complete Prose'' volumes, culminating in the 1980s in the publication of editions of Slauerhoff's. In 2018 was a complete version of all his poems published (J. Slauerhoff - Verzamelde Gedichten. [[Nijgh & Van Ditmar]], editors Hein Aalders and Menno Voskuil, 1037 pages). Wim Hazeu, one of the main biographers of the Netherlands, published a new version of the Slauerhoff biography [[Arbeiderspers]] with 855 pages[[prose]]. The last two books were presented on 7 September 2018 in the Dorpskerk Huizum in Leeuwarden, because this city - birthplace of Slauerhoff - was in 2018 Cultural Capital of Europe.\n\n==Slauerhoff and Huizum ==\n[[File:J.J.Slauerhoff.jpg|thumb|Sculpture of Slauerhoff in Huizum]]\nThe small village [[Huizum]] in [[Friesland]] hosts the annual Slauerhoff Lecture. The church in Huizum holds a bronze bust of Slauerhoff's head, made by Ben van der Geest. Several family members of the poet, including his parents, are buried at the Huizum cemetery. The tombstone plate with the names of Slauerhoff's parents has been standing on a pedestal at the entrance of the Dorpskerk ever since the grave was cleared. The tombstone has been given this prominent place because one of Slauerhoff's longest poems (''In Memoriam Patris'', with 34 stanzas) is dedicated to the burial of his father at the same cemetery.\n\n==Bibliography==\n[[File:Slauerhoff Camoes Macao.jpg|thumb|Slauerhoff near the bust of [[Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es]] in [[Macao]] ]]\n\n===Poetry===\n*''Archipel'' (\"Archipelago\", 1923)\n*''Clair-obscur'' (1927)\n*''[[Oost-Azi\u00eb]]'' (\"East Asia\", 1928, under [[pseudonym|ps.]] John Ravenswood)\n*''[[Eldorado (poems)|Eldorado]]'' (1928)\n*''[[Fleurs de Mar\u00e9cage]]'' (\"Marsh Flowers\", 1929, in French)\n*''[[Saturnus (poems)|Saturnus]]'' (\"Saturn\", 1930, revised and enlarged re-issue of ''Clair-obscur'')\n*''Yoeng Poe Tsjoeng'' (\"Of Little Use\", translations from the Chinese and original poems, 1930)\n*''[[Serenade (poems)|Serenade]]'' (1930)\n*''[[Soleares (poems)|Soleares]]'' (1933)\n*''[[Een eerlijk zeemansgraf]]'' (\"An Honorable Sailor's Grave\", 1936)\n*''Verzamelde gedichten'' (\"Collected Verse\", 1947)\n*''Al dwalend'' (\"Wandering About\", previously uncollected poems, 1947)\n*''Alleen in mijn gedichten kan ik wonen'' (\"Only in My Poems Can I Dwell\", anthology, 1978)\n*''Op aarde niet en niet op zee'' (\"Not on earth, and not at sea\"), poems selected by [[Henny Vrienten]] (Amsterdam: Nijgh & Van Ditmar 2000. {{ISBN|90-388-7039-6}})\n*''In memoriam mijzelf'' (\"In Memory of Myself\", anthology, 2006)\n\n===Prose===\n\n====Original prose====\n*''Het Lente-eiland en andere verhalen'' (\"The Isle of Spring and Other Stories\", 1930, [[short story|short stories]])\n*''Schuim en asch'' (\"Foam and Ashes\", 1930, short stories)\n*''[[Het verboden rijk]]'' (1932, novel); translated into English by Paul Vincent as ''The Forbidden Kingdom'' (London: Pushkin, 2012, {{ISBN|978-1-906548-88-9}})\n*''Het leven op aarde'' (\"Life on Earth\", 1934, novel)\n*''De opstand van Guadalajara'' (\"The Guadalajara Uprising\", 1937, [[posthumous work|posthumous]]ly published novel)\n*''Verzameld proza'' (\"Collected Prose\", 1961)\n*''Verwonderd saam te zijn'' (\"Strange Bedfellows\", 1987, short stories and a [[one act play]] [1928\u20131935])\n*''Alleen de havens zijn ons trouw'' (\"Only the Ports Are Loyal to Us\", 1992, [[Travel literature|travelogue]] short stories [1927\u20131932])\n\n====Translated prose====\n*[[Ricardo G\u00fciraldes]] \u2014 ''Don Segundo Sombra'' (1930, 1941\u00b2, 1948\u00b3; from Spanish with R.

Slauerhoff''', was a Dutch poet and novelist. He is considered one of the most important [[Dutch language]] writers.\n\n==Youth==\nSlauerhoff attended [[Hogereburgerschool|HBS]] (secondary school) in [[Harlingen, Netherlands|Harlingen]], where he first met fellow future writer [[Simon Vestdijk]]. In 1916, Slauerhoff moved to [[Amsterdam]] to read medicine. While at the university, he wrote his first poems; his debut as a poet was in the Communist magazine ''[[De Nieuwe Tijd]]''. He edited the Amsterdam student magazine ''[[Propria Cures]]'' from 1919 to 1920.<ref name=\"stuiveling\"/> In 1919, Slauerhoff became engaged to a Dutch language student, Truus de Ruyter.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} In 1921 he joined the staff of the literary magazine ''[[Het Getij]]'' and later that of ''[[De Vrije Bladen]]''; in this period he became acquainted with poets [[Hendrik Marsman]] and [[Hendrik de Vries]].<ref name=\"stuiveling\"/>\n\n==Early career==\nHis first collection of verse, ''Archipel'' (\"Archipelago\"), was published in 1923.<ref name=\"stuiveling\"/> Afterwards, he started working as a medical doctor on board of ships, especially in South East Asia. Much of his work refers to travel, to longing for far coasts, to China and Japan, and to the sea.\n\n==Marriage, final years==\n[[File:Slauerhoff4.jpg|thumb|Slauerhoff wearing Chinese attire (Coll. Letterkundig Museum)]]\nHis fame as a writer, meanwhile, spread. In 1932 he published ''Het verboden rijk'' (\"The Forbidden Kingdom\"), a partly [[historical novel|historical]], partly [[magical realist]] novel combining the life of a 20th-century European with that of [[Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es]], the 16th-century Portuguese poet (author of sonnets and the epic ''[[Os Lus\u00edadas|The Lusiads]]'') who spent part of his life in the Orient.<ref name=laan/> Despite not being translated into English until 2012,<ref>{{cite book  | last = Slauerhoff  | first = Jacob  | title = The Forbidden Kingdom  | publisher = Pushkin Press  | location = London  | year = 2012}}</ref> it attracted attention from scholars publishing in English, Jane Fenoulhet, for instance, referring to it as an important modernist novel in 2001.<ref>{{cite journal  | last = Fenoulhet  | first = Jane  | title = Time Travel in the Forbidden Realm: J.

Slauerhoff}}</ref>\n\n==Style and themes==\nThough Slauerhoff writes in the time of [[expressionism]], his poetry is, according to Garmt Stuiveling and G.J. van Bork, essentially [[Romanticism|romantic]]: strongly autobiographical, it evidences restlessness, imagination, and a longing for faraway places, expressed through an identification with tramps, discoverers, and pirates.<ref name=\"stuiveling\">{{cite book|last1=Stuiveling|first1=Garmt|last2=Bork|first2=G.J. van|editor=G.J. van Bork, P.J.

A performance of his play ''Jan Pietersz. Coen'' (1930), highly critical of [[Jan Pieterszoon Coen]] (seventeenth-century officer of the [[Dutch East India Company in Indonesia]] and two-term [[Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies]]), was prohibited by the mayor of Amsterdam in 1948.<ref name=laan/>\n\n==Posthumous editions==\n[[File:J.J. Slauerhoff - 'T ZWERK ligt teneergeslagen - Utrechtse Jaagpad 3, Leiden.JPG|thumb|Poem by Slauerhoff on a [[Wall poems in Leiden|wall in Leiden]] ]]\nTwo works in progress that were nearly finished at the time of Slauerhoff's death, the original novel ''De opstand van Guadalajara'' (\"The [[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara]] Uprising\") and the translation of [[Mart\u00edn Luis Guzm\u00e1n]]'s novel ''In de schaduw van den leider'' (\"In the Shadow of the Leader\"), were published [[posthumous work|posthumous]]ly in 1937.\n\nA Committee for the Preparation of Slauerhoff's Complete Works was put together and convened to compile his ''Complete Works''. This Committee, which consisted of leading literary figures, among which a number of friends of Slauerhoff, included [[D.A.M. Binnendijk]], [[Menno ter Braak]], [[N.A. Donkersloot]], [[J. Greshoff]], [[Kees Lekkerkerker]], [[Hendrik Marsman]], [[Adriaan Roland Holst]], and [[Constant van Wessem]]. Du Perron contributed a general outline for the ordering and grouping of the contents, but declined to participate further. Work progressed slowly and was further slowed down by the events of [[World War II]]. The first volume appeared in 1941, one year behind schedule, and the series of eight volumes was not completed until 1958. Two of the Committee's members, Ter Braak and Marsman, died at the start of the war and the publisher, [[Nijgh & Van Ditmar]], lost faith halfway through the project, which resulted in the intended separate volume of [[critical apparatus]] being scrapped and the last volume, containing Slauerhoff's essays, being published independently by Lekkerkerker.\nLekkerkerker, ever the dedicated text researcher and caretaker of Slauerhoff's literary heritage, continued over the years to unearth and study Slauerhoff's [[manuscript]]s and uncollected publications, resulting in ever better versions of the ''Complete Poems'' and ''Complete Prose'' volumes, culminating in the 1980s in the publication of editions of Slauerhoff's. In 2018 was a complete version of all his poems published (J. Slauerhoff - Verzamelde Gedichten. [[Nijgh & Van Ditmar]], editors Hein Aalders and Menno Voskuil, 1037 pages). Wim Hazeu, one of the main biographers of the Netherlands, published a new version of the Slauerhoff biography [[Arbeiderspers]] with 855 pages[[prose]]. The last two books were presented on 7 September 2018 in the Dorpskerk Huizum in Leeuwarden, because this city - birthplace of Slauerhoff - was in 2018 Cultural Capital of Europe.\n\n==Slauerhoff and Huizum ==\n[[File:J.J.Slauerhoff.jpg|thumb|Sculpture of Slauerhoff in Huizum]]\nThe small village [[Huizum]] in [[Friesland]] hosts the annual Slauerhoff Lecture. The church in Huizum holds a bronze bust of Slauerhoff's head, made by Ben van der Geest. Several family members of the poet, including his parents, are buried at the Huizum cemetery. The tombstone plate with the names of Slauerhoff's parents has been standing on a pedestal at the entrance of the Dorpskerk ever since the grave was cleared. The tombstone has been given this prominent place because one of Slauerhoff's longest poems (''In Memoriam Patris'', with 34 stanzas) is dedicated to the burial of his father at the same cemetery.\n\n==Bibliography==\n[[File:Slauerhoff Camoes Macao.jpg|thumb|Slauerhoff near the bust of [[Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es]] in [[Macao]] ]]\n===Poetry===\n*''Archipel'' (\"Archipelago\", 1923)\n*''Clair-obscur'' (1927)\n*''[[Oost-Azi\u00eb]]'' (\"East Asia\", 1928, under [[pseudonym|ps.]] John Ravenswood)\n*''[[Eldorado (poems)|Eldorado]]'' (1928)\n*''[[Fleurs de Mar\u00e9cage]]'' (\"Marsh Flowers\", 1929, in French)\n*''[[Saturnus (poems)|Saturnus]]'' (\"Saturn\", 1930, revised and enlarged re-issue of ''Clair-obscur'')\n*''Yoeng Poe Tsjoeng'' (\"Of Little Use\", translations from the Chinese and original poems, 1930)\n*''[[Serenade (poems)|Serenade]]'' (1930)\n*''[[Soleares (poems)|Soleares]]'' (1933)\n*''[[Een eerlijk zeemansgraf]]'' (\"An Honorable Sailor's Grave\", 1936)\n*''Verzamelde gedichten'' (\"Collected Verse\", 1947)\n*''Al dwalend'' (\"Wandering About\", previously uncollected poems, 1947)\n*''Alleen in mijn gedichten kan ik wonen'' (\"Only in My Poems Can I Dwell\", anthology, 1978)\n*''Op aarde niet en niet op zee'' (\"Not on earth, and not at sea\"), poems selected by [[Henny Vrienten]] (Amsterdam: Nijgh & Van Ditmar 2000. {{ISBN|90-388-7039-6}})\n*''In memoriam mijzelf'' (\"In Memory of Myself\", anthology, 2006)\n\n===Prose===\n\n====Original prose====\n*''Het Lente-eiland en andere verhalen'' (\"The Isle of Spring and Other Stories\", 1930, [[short story|short stories]])\n*''Schuim en asch'' (\"Foam and Ashes\", 1930, short stories)\n*''[[Het verboden rijk]]'' (1932, novel); translated into English by Paul Vincent as ''The Forbidden Kingdom'' (London: Pushkin, 2012, {{ISBN|978-1-906548-88-9}})\n*''Het leven op aarde'' (\"Life on Earth\", 1934, novel)\n*''De opstand van Guadalajara'' (\"The Guadalajara Uprising\", 1937, [[posthumous work|posthumous]]ly published novel)\n*''Verzameld proza'' (\"Collected Prose\", 1961)\n*''Verwonderd saam te zijn'' (\"Strange Bedfellows\", 1987, short stories and a [[one act play]] [1928\u20131935])\n*''Alleen de havens zijn ons trouw'' (\"Only the Ports Are Loyal to Us\", 1992, [[Travel literature|travelogue]] short stories [1927\u20131932])\n\n====Translated prose====\n*[[Ricardo G\u00fciraldes]] \u2014 ''Don Segundo Sombra'' (1930, 1941\u00b2, 1948\u00b3; from Spanish with R.

His roommate, Trimagasi, explains that they are in a tower-style facility in which food is delivered via a platform that travels from the top down through a shaft that goes through the middle of the room. The platform stops for a fixed period of time on each floor, and those on lower levels are able to eat only what those at the top leave them. If prisoners attempt to hoard food after the platform has left their level, the room will be progressively heated or cooled to fatal levels until they let go of their stash. Every month, people are randomly reassigned to a new level. It is revealed that upon admission, each resident is allowed to bring one item in with them, Goreng choosing a copy of [[Don Quixote]], and Trimagasi a self-sharpening knife. \n\nOne day, a bloodied woman named Miharu rides down on the platform, and Trimagasi explains that she descends the pit every month in search of her child. Goreng witnesses her being attacked by the two people on the level below and is initially worried for her, debating whether to jump down and help her. However, after a few minutes of overhearing the struggle, it is shown that Miharu has actually managed to kill them both, riding the platform down once again.\n\nAs they talk, it is revealed that Goreng volunteered to spend six months in the pit in exchange for a diploma, and Trimagasi is serving a year-long sentence for manslaughter. Over the course of the month, they appear to become acquainted, but on the day of the room shuffle, Goreng wakes up gagged and tied to the bed. They have been reassigned to level 171, where the platform is expected to be completely empty of food when it arrives. Trimagasi explains that he plans to cut strips of Goreng's flesh to sustain them both. On the eighth day, Trimagasi cuts into Goreng's leg but is attacked by Miharu as she comes riding down the platform. She cuts Goreng free and he kills Trimagasi. Miharu cuts some of Trimagasi's flesh, feeding Goreng and eating some herself before continuing down. \n\nThe following month, Goreng awakes on level 33 with a woman, Imoguiri, as a cellmate. The only thing she brought with her was her dog. Goreng recognizes her as the official who questioned him before sending him to the pit. She tells Goreng that she believes there are 200 floors in total, and that she was unaware of the Pit's horrible conditions and volunteered to try to fix things when she was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Imoguiri rations her food and attempts to convince those below to do so as well, but they ignore her until Goreng threatens to defecate in their food.\n\nGoreng encounters Miharu once again as she rides down on the platform but appears critically injured, presumably from being in a physical altercation from the above levels. Goreng and Imoguiri grab her off the platform and tend to her wounds. Miharu spends the rest of the evening recovering from her injuries and sleeping. Goreng explains to Imoguiri about Miharu's search for her child to which Imoguiri refutes the story; she explains that nobody under the age of 16 is allowed into the facility and that Miharu is in fact an actress who volunteered to enter and did so alone. \n\nGoreng awakens in the middle of the night to see Miharu and Imoguiri in a tense standoff, where it is revealed that Miharu has slaughtered and eaten Imoguiri's dog.   \n\nGoreng awakens the following month on level 202 and finds that Imoguiri has hanged herself. Goreng eats her flesh to survive, experiencing hallucinations of her and Trimagasi instructing him to do so. He is then seen awakening the following month on level 6. His roommate, Baharat, attempts to climb up and escape through the top level with the help of those above using a rope he brought into the pit. The couple living on level 5 first simulate an intention to help him, but end up defecating in his face, and pushing him back into the hole while mocking him. Estimating that there are around 250 levels in total, Goreng makes a plan to ride the platform down, rationing the food, and convinces Baharat to go with him.\n\nAs they descend, they hand out portions to the prisoners, attacking those who refuse to cooperate. Going down, they encounter Miharu fighting two other residents and try to help her, but ultimately fail to help her from getting killed, both sustaining injuries in doing so. Goreng and Baharat continue to descend and discover that the platform doesn't stop on levels where there's no one alive, eventually passing level 250 and reaching level 333 where the platform stops in an apparently empty room. Assuming that it must be the last level they get off, but the platform continues down, stranding them. They then discover a little girl in the room, who turns out to be Miharu's actual daughter, and feed her an untouched [[panna cotta]] they had been saving as a \"message\" for the chefs at the top. Goreng passes out and dreams of Baharat telling him that \"the girl is the message.\" The next day, Goreng finds Baharat dead after succumbing to his injuries, and takes the child with him when the platform arrives; they descend to the bottom of the pit where he once again sees Trimagasi, who tells him that \"the message requires no bearer.\" Goreng gets off the platform and walks away with Trimagasi, both turning to watch as the girl is transported up the pit.\n\n== Cast==\n* [[Iv\u00e1n Massagu\u00e9]] as ''Goreng'', named after ''[[:wiktionary:goreng|gor\u00e8ng]]''\n* Zorion Eguileor ([[:eu:Zorion_Egileor|eu]]) as ''Trimagasi'', named after terima kasih, which stands for \"thank you\" in Malay/Indonesian language\n* [[Antonia San Juan]] as ''Imoguiri'', named after ''[[Imogiri]]''\n* [[Emilio Buale Coka]] as ''Baharat'', named after ''[[baharat]]''\n* Alexandra Masangkay as ''Miharu'' \n* Eric L.

His roommate, Trimagasi, explains that they are in a tower-style facility in which food is delivered via a platform that travels from the top down through a shaft that goes through the middle of the room. The platform stops for a fixed period of time on each floor, and those on lower levels are able to eat only what those at the top leave them. If prisoners attempt to hoard food after the platform has left their level, the room will be progressively heated or cooled to fatal levels until they let go of their stash. Every month, people are randomly reassigned to a new level. It is revealed that upon admission, each resident is allowed to bring one item in with them, Goreng choosing a copy of [[Don Quixote]], and Trimagasi a self-sharpening knife. \n\nOne day, a bloodied woman named Miharu rides down on the platform, and Trimagasi explains that she descends the pit every month in search of her child. Goreng witnesses her being attacked by the two people on the level below and is initially worried for her, debating whether to jump down and help her. However, after a few minutes of overhearing the struggle, it is shown that Miharu has actually managed to kill them both, riding the platform down once again.\n\nAs they talk, it is revealed that Goreng volunteered to spend six months in the pit in exchange for a diploma, and Trimagasi is serving a year-long sentence for manslaughter. Over the course of the month, they appear to become acquainted, but on the day of the room shuffle, Goreng wakes up gagged and tied to the bed. They have been reassigned to level 171, where the platform is expected to be completely empty of food when it arrives. Trimagasi explains that he plans to cut strips of Goreng's flesh to sustain them both. On the eighth day, Trimagasi cuts into Goreng's leg but is attacked by Miharu as she comes riding down the platform. She cuts Goreng free and he kills Trimagasi. Miharu cuts some of Trimagasi's flesh, feeding Goreng and eating some herself before continuing down. \n\nThe following month, Goreng awakes on level 33 with a woman, Imoguiri, as a cellmate. The only thing she brought with her was her dog. Goreng recognizes her as the official who questioned him before sending him to the pit. She tells Goreng that she believes there are 200 floors in total, and that she was unaware of the Pit's horrible conditions and volunteered to try to fix things when she was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Imoguiri rations her food and attempts to convince those below to do so as well, but they ignore her until Goreng threatens to defecate in their food.\n\nGoreng encounters Miharu once again as she rides down on the platform but appears critically injured, presumably from being in a physical altercation from the above levels. Goreng and Imoguiri grab her off the platform and tend to her wounds. Miharu spends the rest of the evening recovering from her injuries and sleeping. Goreng explains to Imoguiri about Miharu's search for her child to which Imoguiri refutes the story; she explains that nobody under the age of 16 is allowed into the facility and that Miharu is in fact an actress who volunteered to enter and did so alone. \n\nGoreng awakens in the middle of the night to see Miharu and Imoguiri in a tense standoff, where it is revealed that Miharu has slaughtered and eaten Imoguiri's dog.   \n\nGoreng awakens the following month on level 202 and finds that Imoguiri has hanged herself. Goreng eats her flesh to survive, experiencing hallucinations of her and Trimagasi instructing him to do so. He is then seen awakening the following month on level 6. His roommate, Baharat, attempts to climb up and escape through the top level with the help of those above using a rope he brought into the pit. The couple living on level 5 first simulate an intention to help him, but end up defecating in his face, and pushing him back into the hole while mocking him. Estimating that there are around 250 levels in total, Goreng makes a plan to ride the platform down, rationing the food, and convinces Baharat to go with him.\n\nAs they descend, they hand out portions to the prisoners, attacking those who refuse to cooperate. Going down, they encounter Miharu fighting two other residents and try to help her, but ultimately fail to help her from getting killed, both sustaining injuries in doing so. Goreng and Baharat continue to descend and discover that the platform doesn't stop on levels where there's no one alive, eventually passing level 250 and reaching level 333 where the platform stops in an apparently empty room. Assuming that it must be the last level they get off, but the platform continues down, stranding them. They then discover a little girl in the room, who turns out to be Miharu's actual daughter, and feed her an untouched [[panna cotta]] they had been saving as a \"message\" for the chefs at the top. Goreng passes out and dreams of Baharat telling him that \"the girl is the message.\" The next day, Goreng finds Baharat dead after succumbing to his injuries, and takes the child with him when the platform arrives; they descend to the bottom of the pit where he once again sees Trimagasi, who tells him that \"the message requires no bearer.\" Goreng gets off the platform and walks away with Trimagasi, both turning to watch as the girl is transported up the pit.\n\n== Cast==\n* [[Iv\u00e1n Massagu\u00e9]] as ''Goreng'', named after ''[[:wiktionary:goreng|gor\u00e8ng]]''\n* Zorion Eguileor ([[:eu:Zorion_Egileor|eu]]) as ''Trimagasi'', named after terima kasih, which stands for \"thank you\" in Malay/Indonesian language\n* [[Antonia San Juan]] as ''Imoguiri'', named after ''[[Imogiri]]''\n* [[Emilio Buale Coka]] as ''Baharat'', named after ''[[baharat]]''\n* Alexandra Masangkay as ''Miharu'' \n* Eric L.

In 1907 Rua formed a non-violent religious community at [[Maungapohatu|Maungap\u014dhatu]], the sacred mountain of Ng\u0101i T\u016bhoe, in the Urewera. By 1900, Maungap\u014dhatu was one of the few areas that had not been investigated by the [[M\u0101ori Land Court|Native Land Court]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/page/native-land-court-created|title=Native Land Court created  - NZHistory, New Zealand history online|publisher=}}</ref> The community, also known as [[New Jerusalem]], included a farming co-operative and a [[savings bank]]. Many P\u0101keh\u0101 believed the community was subversive and saw Rua as a disruptive influence.<ref name=\"heritageetal.blogspot.co.nz\">{{cite web|url=http://heritageetal.blogspot.co.nz/2014/08/rua-kenana-maori-prophet.html|title=Heritage et AL: Rua K\u0113nana - M\u0101ori prophet|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1916 police mounted an armed expedition, arriving at Maungap\u014dhatu on 2 April to arrest Rua for [[sedition]].  He was found not guilty on this charge but imprisoned for resisting arrest.  Rua was released in April 1918 and returned to Maungap\u014dhatu, the community was however in decline and by the early 1930s, most people had left to find work elsewhere. Rua moved on to Matahi in the eastern [[Bay of Plenty]] and lived there until his death in 1937.\n\nIn September 2017, the government committed to pardon him as part of a [[Treaty of Waitangi claims and settlements|treaty settlement]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/339070/kenana-pardon-a-chance-to-move-forward-signatory|title=K\u0113nana pardon a chance to move forward - signatory|date=2017-09-09|work=Radio New Zealand|access-date=2017-09-12|language=en-nz}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nRua was born in 1869 at Maungap\u014dhatu in the [[Urewera Ranges|Urewera Country]] New Zealand. He was the [[Posthumous birth|posthumous son]] of Kenana Tumoana, who was killed at Makaretu in November 1868 while fighting for [[Te Kooti]], and of Ngahiwi Te Rihi. Rua was a member of the Tamakaimoana [[hap\u016b]] of the [[Ng\u0101i T\u016bhoe|T\u016bhoe tribe]] and, although not a chief in his own right, was of high birth and could trace his descent from Potiki and Toroa of the [[Mataatua]] canoe.\n\nIn 1887 Rua left Maungap\u014dhatu to learn farming. He worked on sheep stations in the [[Gisborne, New Zealand|Gisborne]] and [[Bay of Plenty]] districts and was a member of a shearing gang on the East Coast. During this period he studied the [[Bible]]. In 1905 he returned to Maungap\u014dhatu where he set himself up as a [[prophet]] of the [[New Testament]] type. Here he formed his new self-sufficient community at Maungap\u014dhatu which he called the \"[[New Jerusalem]]\" with its eventual population of between 800\u20131000 followers.\n\n== The prophet at Maungap\u014dhatu ==\n[[Image:Rua stands on a rock at the centre..jpg|thumb|225px|left|Rua standing on the rock in the centre]]\nTe Kooti Arikirangi, the founder of the [[Ringatu]] religion, had predicted before he died that he would have successor.<ref name=\"TipunaProfiles\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ngaituhoe.com/Folders/TipunaProfiles.html|title=Prophet Rua Kenana|publisher=}}</ref> Rua's statement that he was the successor to Te Kooti was first announced through an experience that he underwent on Maungap\u014dhatu, the sacred mountain of T\u016bhoe. The oral narratives tell how Rua and his first wife, [[Pinepine Te Rika]], were directed to climb the mountain by a [[supernatural]] [[Vision (spirituality)|apparition]], later revealed to be the [[archangel Gabriel]]. There they were shown a hidden diamond, the guardian-stone of the land, whose bright light was shielded by Te Kooti's shawl. Rua, in his turn, covered it again to protect it. In some versions of the narrative Rua met both Whaitiri, the ancestress of T\u016bhoe, and [[Jesus|Christ]] on the mountain. Rua would soon claim to be the [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] brother of Christ.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/3r32/rua-kenana-hepetipa |title= Rua Kanara Hepetipa  |publisher=Te Ara (encyclopaedia) |date= }}</ref>\n\nThe first of three periods of settlement at Maungap\u014dhatu, Rua arrived at this isolated outpost as the winter set in. Those who were there can still remember the harshness of that first year: the potato crop failed and there were no pigs to be had. Tatu, one of the Riwaiti, had to go back to [[Te Whaiti]] to collect 6 sows to start their own breeding colony. At least 50 people died that winter, most of them children, from the inadequacy of the houses, an outbreak of [[Typhoid fever|typhoid]] which came from the valley camps, and a [[measles]] [[epidemic]] which devastated the community. Sometimes there was nothing to eat but [[Huhu beetle|huhu]], and the coarse toi leaves, normally used only for clothing. But from this inauspicious beginning, the community struggled on to a first summer of great plenty.  Two groups had come together to build \u2018te pa tapu o te atua\u2019, the sacred [[p\u0101 (M\u0101ori)|p\u0101]] of the Lord, the T\u016bhoe, about half the entire tribe, and the Whakatohea, who through confiscation were almost landless. To signify the union between these two Mataatua tribes, Rua constructed the house of the Lord, Hiruharama Hou, built with two gables. One side was for T\u016bhoe and the other for Whakatohea.<ref>Mihaia : the prophet Rua Kenana and his community at Maungapohatu ([[Judith Binney]] with Gillian Chaplin and Craig Wallace. Oxford University Press, 1979. pages 45\u201356).</ref>\n\n[[File:Maungapohatu, city of the mist 1908.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Maungapohatu, city of the mist]]\nRua claimed to be the new Christ, the son of [[Jehovah]], and said that no one who joined him would die. He called himself Te Mihaia Hou, the New [[Messiah]]. Rua owed his power to the great skill with which he applied the scriptures to the day today events in the lives of those who believed in him. His prophetic sayings (nga kupu whakari) gave meaning to a harsh existence, and offered hope to the future. He attempted to create a new system of land ownership and land usage. He organised a strong communal basis in all the settlements he founded but also emphasised the concept of family ownership of property. He cast aside all traditional M\u0101ori [[Tapu (Polynesian culture)|tapu]] practices and replaced them with new forms specifically associated with the faith in himself as the Promised Messiah. His followers vested their lands in Rua and he had these surveyed and sold back to them. The settlement was administered by the prophet's own parliament. He also formed a M\u0101ori mining company to exploit the mineral resources of the Urewera. At the prophet's command, 5 miles of forest were cleared and a prosperous farming community grew up under his leadership. Rua acted as his people's banker and took [[tithe]]s of all they earned. In return, he gave them a prosperity they had never before known.\n\nRua built a curious two-storied circular temple of worship at Maungap\u014dhatu, called the H\u012bona ([[Zion]]) that also became his parliament from where the community affairs were administered. This circular meeting house, built in 1908, was decorated with a design of blue clubs and yellow diamonds, and stood within the inner sanctum of the pa. This was Rua's  \u201cCouncil Chamber and Court House\u201d \u2013 also known as \u201cRua's Temple\u201d. Rua thought it was modelled on the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Jerusalem Temple]] (even though his chamber was not to be a place of worship), but the actual model was the present day [[Dome of the Rock]] on Jerusalem's Temple Mount, a Muslim holy site and one of the most sacred of Islamic shrines.  Its unique cylinder shape would make it one of a kind<ref name=\"TipunaProfiles\"/> He grew his hair long and affected a bushy beard in the patriarchal tradition fashioned on the Jewish [[Nazirite]]. As his reading of the Bible appeared to prescribe seven wives, Rua kept to this number and immediately replaced any who died or ran away. In all he had 12 wives and over 70 children.\n\nFrom the King-ite tradition he inherited the idea that M\u0101ori possessed a separate nationality, and this, together with the success of his community, aroused the jealousy of local chiefs and incurred the Government's enmity. Through his personal vision his messianic religion promised the return of M\u0101ori lands and [[mana]] to M\u0101ori, and the end of their subjection to [[p\u0101keh\u0101]] rule. He wanted to remove the T\u016bhoe people totally from European influence and induced many to sell all their stock and farming interests.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aotearoa.wellington.net.nz/he/rua.htm|title=Rua Kenana \u2013 Let the white man, fight the white mans war!<!-- Bot generated title -->|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Power==\nBy 1908 Rua's struggle for power had brought the T\u016bhoe to the brink of civil war and the Prime Minister Sir [[Joseph Ward]] intervened to curb the prophet's influence.  The Government had organised a meeting in March 1908 at [[Ruatoki]] of all the T\u016bhoe tribes in an attempt to sort out the political differences between the two main T\u016bhoe factions, that of Rua Kenana and Numai Kereru, chief of the Ngatirongo and the main opponent among the T\u016bhoe of Rua's [[Judeo-Christian|Christian-Judaic]] religious movement.  [[File:Rua Kenana and four of his wives.jpg|thumb|left|Rua and four of his wives]] Because conflict was expected, the New Zealand Prime Minister had decided to informally visit both parties before the conference.  At a dramatic encounter with Sir Joseph Ward on the [[Whakatane]] beach front on 23 March 1908, Rua and Joseph Ward exchanged words.  Rua, flanked by some of his wives and supporters while seated on a chair that had been borrowed from the pub, acknowledged Joseph Ward approaching. Ward addressed both parties publicly, asking for their assistance in reconciling the differences in the forthcoming meeting at Ruatoki.  To Rua's followers Ward said that he could not accept all that Rua had asked for.

The mainstream [[Anglican]] church encouraged the Government to suppress Rua Kenana. In 1907, the church passed a motion that supported \"the recent action of the Government in the direction of the suppression of tohungism (traditional M\u0101ori healing), and trusts that it may be possible for the Church to make more aggressive action among the tribes which are specifically affected by this evil.\"  Authorities saw Rua Kenana as a disruptive influence and targeted him with the [[Tohunga Suppression Act 1907]], which banned traditional [[Tohunga|M\u0101ori healers]] from using herbs and other healing methods which were part of their traditional medicine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/hawkes-bay-today/news/headlines.cfm?c_id=1503462|title=Local, latest and breaking news from the Hawkes Bay region - Hawkes Bay Today|publisher=}}</ref> The Tohunga Suppression Act was designed to neutralise powerful traditional M\u0101ori leaders and tailor-made as a political weapon specifically against Rua Kenana and his movement of dissenting M\u0101ori.<ref>[http://www.austlii.edu.au/nz/journals/VUWLRev/2001/17.html A Return to the Tohunga Suppression Act 1907 \u2013 [2001&#93; VUWLRev 17; (2001) 32 VUWLR 437<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nAs a result of a number of charges of obtaining alcohol in 1910, Rua was fined for [[Sly-grog shop|sly grogging]] and, in 1915, served a short gaol sentence for a similar offence.

Rua said, \"I have 1400 men here and I am not going to let any of them enlist or go to war. You have no king now. The King of England he is no good. He is beat. The Germans will win.

The Government arrested Rua after a 1915 hahunga, a bone cleansing ceremony, where he allegedly supplied liquor without a licence. He was summoned to appear before a magistrate on 19 January 1916, Rua said he would appear at the February court session as he was busy harvesting cocksfoot grass but his non-appearance was deemed to be contempt of court and preparations began for an armed police expedition to arrest him.<ref name=\"heritageetal.blogspot.co.nz\"/>\n\nOn 2 April 1916 a 70-strong, and heavily armed, police party arrived at Maungap\u014dhatu to arrest him for [[sedition]]. Because Rua's village was so remote, the police had to take a lot of equipment and camped on the way. They moved like a small army with wagons and pack-horses, and included [[The New Zealand Herald|''New Zealand Herald'']] photographer [[Arthur Breckon]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Three Veteran Journalists Retire|last=|first=|date=June 12, 1940|work=The New Zealand Journalist|access-date=|via=}}</ref> So as not to alert the Maungap\u014dhatu village of their intention to spring an attack they did not wear their police uniforms till just before the raid. They were convinced that when they reached Maungap\u014dhatu there would be an ambush.\n\nThere was no violent resistance from Rua personally,<ref name=\"TipunaProfiles\"/> but his supporters fought a brisk half-hour gun battle with the police in which two M\u0101ori, including Rua's son Toko, were killed and two wounded. Four constables were also wounded. Rua was arrested and transported to [[Rotorua]], his hair and beard removed. From Rotorua, with six other M\u0101ori prisoners including Whatu, Rua was transferred to [[Auckland]] and sent directly to [[Mount Eden Prisons|Mount Eden Prison]]. Rua was held, at first, on a nine months sentence imposed for the 1915 charges and now increased by his default of fines. After a trial on sedition which lasted 47&nbsp;days, New Zealand's longest until 1977, he was found not guilty; but sentenced to one year's imprisonment for resisting the police.<ref>Mihaia : the prophet Rua Kenana and his community at Maungapohatu ([[Judith Binney]] with Gillian Chaplin and Craig Wallace.

The [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian Mission]] under Rev. John Laughton had moved into Maungap\u014dhatu and was teaching Presbyterian Christianity and P\u0101keh\u0101 value systems. This shocked Rua, as he had banned p\u0101keh\u0101 schools from the original community. The costs of defence at the various trials had ruined the community financially as it had to sell stock and land to meet the debt. The community was even ordered to pay the costs of the entire police operations and raid at Maungap\u014dhatu . Even though the supreme court had found Rua's arrest illegal and a legal petition had been drafted to Parliament on 1 May 1917 on behalf of the Maungap\u014dhatu people calling for a full public inquiry into the events of 2 April 1916, and the behaviour of the police there and later intimidating witnesses, no compensation was ever offered to Maungap\u014dhatu.<ref>Mihaia : the prophet Rua Kenana and his community at Maungapohatu ([[Judith Binney]] with Gillian Chaplin and Craig Wallace.

He was survived by five wives, nine sons, and 13 daughters. Belief in his divinity did not long survive him, however, as he failed to fulfill his promise to rise from the dead. Little now remains of Maungap\u014dhatu, and his church (Te Wairua Tapu) boasts few followers.

In 1907 Rua formed a non-violent religious community at [[Maungapohatu|Maungap\u014dhatu]], the sacred mountain of Ng\u0101i T\u016bhoe, in the Urewera. By 1900, Maungap\u014dhatu was one of the few areas that had not been investigated by the [[M\u0101ori Land Court|Native Land Court]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/page/native-land-court-created|title=Native Land Court created  - NZHistory, New Zealand history online|publisher=}}</ref> The community, also known as [[New Jerusalem]], included a farming co-operative and a [[savings bank]].

He was found not guilty on this charge but imprisoned for resisting arrest.  Rua was released in April 1918 and returned to Maungap\u014dhatu, the community was however in decline and by the early 1930s, most people had left to find work elsewhere. Rua moved on to Matahi in the eastern [[Bay of Plenty]] and lived there until his death in 1937.\n\nIn September 2017, the government committed to pardon him as part of a [[Treaty of Waitangi claims and settlements|treaty settlement]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/339070/kenana-pardon-a-chance-to-move-forward-signatory|title=K\u0113nana pardon a chance to move forward - signatory|date=2017-09-09|work=Radio New Zealand|access-date=2017-09-12|language=en-nz}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nRua was born in 1869 at Maungap\u014dhatu in the [[Urewera Ranges|Urewera Country]] New Zealand. He was the [[Posthumous birth|posthumous son]] of Kenana Tumoana, who was killed at Makaretu in November 1868 while fighting for [[Te Kooti]], and of Ngahiwi Te Rihi. Rua was a member of the Tamakaimoana [[hap\u016b]] of the [[Ng\u0101i T\u016bhoe|T\u016bhoe tribe]] and, although not a chief in his own right, was of high birth and could trace his descent from Potiki and Toroa of the [[Mataatua]] canoe.\n\nIn 1887 Rua left Maungap\u014dhatu to learn farming. He worked on sheep stations in the [[Gisborne, New Zealand|Gisborne]] and [[Bay of Plenty]] districts and was a member of a shearing gang on the East Coast. During this period he studied the [[Bible]]. In 1905 he returned to Maungap\u014dhatu where he set himself up as a [[prophet]] of the [[New Testament]] type. Here he formed his new self-sufficient community at Maungap\u014dhatu which he called the \"[[New Jerusalem]]\" with its eventual population of between 800\u20131000 followers.\n\n== The prophet at Maungap\u014dhatu ==\n[[Image:Rua stands on a rock at the centre..jpg|thumb|225px|left|Rua standing on the rock in the centre]]\nTe Kooti Arikirangi, the founder of the [[Ringatu]] religion, had predicted before he died that he would have successor.<ref name=\"TipunaProfiles\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ngaituhoe.com/Folders/TipunaProfiles.html|title=Prophet Rua Kenana|publisher=}}</ref> Rua's statement that he was the successor to Te Kooti was first announced through an experience that he underwent on Maungap\u014dhatu, the sacred mountain of T\u016bhoe. The oral narratives tell how Rua and his first wife, [[Pinepine Te Rika]], were directed to climb the mountain by a [[supernatural]] [[Vision (spirituality)|apparition]], later revealed to be the [[archangel Gabriel]]. There they were shown a hidden diamond, the guardian-stone of the land, whose bright light was shielded by Te Kooti's shawl. Rua, in his turn, covered it again to protect it. In some versions of the narrative Rua met both Whaitiri, the ancestress of T\u016bhoe, and [[Jesus|Christ]] on the mountain. Rua would soon claim to be the [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] brother of Christ.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/3r32/rua-kenana-hepetipa |title= Rua Kanara Hepetipa  |publisher=Te Ara (encyclopaedia) |date= }}</ref>\n\nThe first of three periods of settlement at Maungap\u014dhatu, Rua arrived at this isolated outpost as the winter set in. Those who were there can still remember the harshness of that first year: the potato crop failed and there were no pigs to be had. Tatu, one of the Riwaiti, had to go back to [[Te Whaiti]] to collect 6 sows to start their own breeding colony. At least 50 people died that winter, most of them children, from the inadequacy of the houses, an outbreak of [[Typhoid fever|typhoid]] which came from the valley camps, and a [[measles]] [[epidemic]] which devastated the community. Sometimes there was nothing to eat but [[Huhu beetle|huhu]], and the coarse toi leaves, normally used only for clothing. But from this inauspicious beginning, the community struggled on to a first summer of great plenty.  Two groups had come together to build \u2018te pa tapu o te atua\u2019, the sacred [[p\u0101 (M\u0101ori)|p\u0101]] of the Lord, the T\u016bhoe, about half the entire tribe, and the Whakatohea, who through confiscation were almost landless. To signify the union between these two Mataatua tribes, Rua constructed the house of the Lord, Hiruharama Hou, built with two gables. One side was for T\u016bhoe and the other for Whakatohea.<ref>Mihaia : the prophet Rua Kenana and his community at Maungapohatu ([[Judith Binney]] with Gillian Chaplin and Craig Wallace. Oxford University Press, 1979. pages 45\u201356).</ref>\n\n[[File:Maungapohatu, city of the mist 1908.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Maungapohatu, city of the mist]]\nRua claimed to be the new Christ, the son of [[Jehovah]], and said that no one who joined him would die. He called himself Te Mihaia Hou, the New [[Messiah]]. Rua owed his power to the great skill with which he applied the scriptures to the day today events in the lives of those who believed in him. His prophetic sayings (nga kupu whakari) gave meaning to a harsh existence, and offered hope to the future. He attempted to create a new system of land ownership and land usage. He organised a strong communal basis in all the settlements he founded but also emphasised the concept of family ownership of property. He cast aside all traditional M\u0101ori [[Tapu (Polynesian culture)|tapu]] practices and replaced them with new forms specifically associated with the faith in himself as the Promised Messiah. His followers vested their lands in Rua and he had these surveyed and sold back to them. The settlement was administered by the prophet's own parliament. He also formed a M\u0101ori mining company to exploit the mineral resources of the Urewera. At the prophet's command, 5 miles of forest were cleared and a prosperous farming community grew up under his leadership. Rua acted as his people's banker and took [[tithe]]s of all they earned. In return, he gave them a prosperity they had never before known.\n\nRua built a curious two-storied circular temple of worship at Maungap\u014dhatu, called the H\u012bona ([[Zion]]) that also became his parliament from where the community affairs were administered. This circular meeting house, built in 1908, was decorated with a design of blue clubs and yellow diamonds, and stood within the inner sanctum of the pa. This was Rua's  \u201cCouncil Chamber and Court House\u201d \u2013 also known as \u201cRua's Temple\u201d. Rua thought it was modelled on the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Jerusalem Temple]] (even though his chamber was not to be a place of worship), but the actual model was the present day [[Dome of the Rock]] on Jerusalem's Temple Mount, a Muslim holy site and one of the most sacred of Islamic shrines.  Its unique cylinder shape would make it one of a kind<ref name=\"TipunaProfiles\"/> He grew his hair long and affected a bushy beard in the patriarchal tradition fashioned on the Jewish [[Nazirite]]. As his reading of the Bible appeared to prescribe seven wives, Rua kept to this number and immediately replaced any who died or ran away. In all he had 12 wives and over 70 children.\n\nFrom the King-ite tradition he inherited the idea that M\u0101ori possessed a separate nationality, and this, together with the success of his community, aroused the jealousy of local chiefs and incurred the Government's enmity. Through his personal vision his messianic religion promised the return of M\u0101ori lands and [[mana]] to M\u0101ori, and the end of their subjection to [[p\u0101keh\u0101]] rule. He wanted to remove the T\u016bhoe people totally from European influence and induced many to sell all their stock and farming interests.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aotearoa.wellington.net.nz/he/rua.htm|title=Rua Kenana \u2013 Let the white man, fight the white mans war!<!-- Bot generated title -->|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Power==\nBy 1908 Rua's struggle for power had brought the T\u016bhoe to the brink of civil war and the Prime Minister Sir [[Joseph Ward]] intervened to curb the prophet's influence.  The Government had organised a meeting in March 1908 at [[Ruatoki]] of all the T\u016bhoe tribes in an attempt to sort out the political differences between the two main T\u016bhoe factions, that of Rua Kenana and Numai Kereru, chief of the Ngatirongo and the main opponent among the T\u016bhoe of Rua's [[Judeo-Christian|Christian-Judaic]] religious movement.  [[File:Rua Kenana and four of his wives.jpg|thumb|left|Rua and four of his wives]] Because conflict was expected, the New Zealand Prime Minister had decided to informally visit both parties before the conference.  At a dramatic encounter with Sir Joseph Ward on the [[Whakatane]] beach front on 23 March 1908, Rua and Joseph Ward exchanged words.  Rua, flanked by some of his wives and supporters while seated on a chair that had been borrowed from the pub, acknowledged Joseph Ward approaching. Ward addressed both parties publicly, asking for their assistance in reconciling the differences in the forthcoming meeting at Ruatoki.  To Rua's followers Ward said that he could not accept all that Rua had asked for. In particular, his request for his supporters to be placed on the European electoral role (presumably because they were outnumbered in the [[Eastern Maori|Eastern Maori electorate]]) was unacceptable, for M\u0101ori have \"special representation of their own.\u201d  To Rua's request to have a special M\u0101ori government, he said, \u201cI told Rua... that in New Zealand [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|King Edward]] is king, and is represented here by his government or king. There can\u2019t be two suns shining in the sky at the same time.\u201d Rua replied to Ward, \"Yes, there is only one sun in the heavens, but it shines on one side \u2013 the P\u0101keh\u0101 side \u2013 and it darkens on the other.\u201d<ref>Mihaia : the prophet Rua Kenana and his community at Maungapohatu ([[Judith Binney]] with Gillian Chaplin and Craig Wallace.

The mainstream [[Anglican]] church encouraged the Government to suppress Rua Kenana. In 1907, the church passed a motion that supported \"the recent action of the Government in the direction of the suppression of tohungism (traditional M\u0101ori healing), and trusts that it may be possible for the Church to make more aggressive action among the tribes which are specifically affected by this evil.\"  Authorities saw Rua Kenana as a disruptive influence and targeted him with the [[Tohunga Suppression Act 1907]], which banned traditional [[Tohunga|M\u0101ori healers]] from using herbs and other healing methods which were part of their traditional medicine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/hawkes-bay-today/news/headlines.cfm?c_id=1503462|title=Local, latest and breaking news from the Hawkes Bay region - Hawkes Bay Today|publisher=}}</ref> The Tohunga Suppression Act was designed to neutralise powerful traditional M\u0101ori leaders and tailor-made as a political weapon specifically against Rua Kenana and his movement of dissenting M\u0101ori.<ref>[http://www.austlii.edu.au/nz/journals/VUWLRev/2001/17.html A Return to the Tohunga Suppression Act 1907 \u2013 [2001&#93; VUWLRev 17; (2001) 32 VUWLR 437<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nAs a result of a number of charges of obtaining alcohol in 1910, Rua was fined for [[Sly-grog shop|sly grogging]] and, in 1915, served a short gaol sentence for a similar offence. On his release he resumed his sly grogging.\n\nRua insisted that his people boycott military service, arguing it was immoral to fight for a P\u0101keh\u0101 King and Country given the injustice meted out on M\u0101ori under the British crown. Rua said, \"I have 1400 men here and I am not going to let any of them enlist or go to war. You have no king now. The King of England he is no good. He is beat. The Germans will win. Any money I have I will give to the Germans. The English are no good. They have two laws. One for the M\u0101ori and one for the P\u0101keh\u0101. When the Germans win I am going to be king here. I will be king of the M\u0101ori and of the P\u0101keh\u0101.\"<ref>Sheehan, Mark (1989), M\u0101ori and P\u0101keh\u0101: Race Relations 1912\u20131980. MacMillan, New Zealand.</ref> This was taken by the establishment as [[sedition]] and finally gave the Government and Rua's detractors the incentive to intervene against Kenana and the Maungap\u014dhatu community.\n\n==Arrest==\n[[Image:Rua Kenana meets with NZ PM Joseph Ward.jpg|thumb|230px|right|Rua Kenana meets with New Zealand Prime Minister [[Joseph Ward]] on [[Whakatane]] Beach, 23 March 1908.]]\nDuring the [[World War I|First World War]] the New Zealand Government had concerns that Rua opposed T\u016bhoe men enlisting for war, these concerns resulted in rumours that he openly supported Germany.  The Government arrested Rua after a 1915 hahunga, a bone cleansing ceremony, where he allegedly supplied liquor without a licence. He was summoned to appear before a magistrate on 19 January 1916, Rua said he would appear at the February court session as he was busy harvesting cocksfoot grass but his non-appearance was deemed to be contempt of court and preparations began for an armed police expedition to arrest him.<ref name=\"heritageetal.blogspot.co.nz\"/>\n\nOn 2 April 1916 a 70-strong, and heavily armed, police party arrived at Maungap\u014dhatu to arrest him for [[sedition]]. Because Rua's village was so remote, the police had to take a lot of equipment and camped on the way. They moved like a small army with wagons and pack-horses, and included [[The New Zealand Herald|''New Zealand Herald'']] photographer [[Arthur Breckon]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Three Veteran Journalists Retire|last=|first=|date=June 12, 1940|work=The New Zealand Journalist|access-date=|via=}}</ref> So as not to alert the Maungap\u014dhatu village of their intention to spring an attack they did not wear their police uniforms till just before the raid. They were convinced that when they reached Maungap\u014dhatu there would be an ambush.\n\nThere was no violent resistance from Rua personally,<ref name=\"TipunaProfiles\"/> but his supporters fought a brisk half-hour gun battle with the police in which two M\u0101ori, including Rua's son Toko, were killed and two wounded. Four constables were also wounded. Rua was arrested and transported to [[Rotorua]], his hair and beard removed. From Rotorua, with six other M\u0101ori prisoners including Whatu, Rua was transferred to [[Auckland]] and sent directly to [[Mount Eden Prisons|Mount Eden Prison]]. Rua was held, at first, on a nine months sentence imposed for the 1915 charges and now increased by his default of fines. After a trial on sedition which lasted 47&nbsp;days, New Zealand's longest until 1977, he was found not guilty; but sentenced to one year's imprisonment for resisting the police.<ref>Mihaia : the prophet Rua Kenana and his community at Maungapohatu ([[Judith Binney]] with Gillian Chaplin and Craig Wallace.

The [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian Mission]] under Rev. John Laughton had moved into Maungap\u014dhatu and was teaching Presbyterian Christianity and P\u0101keh\u0101 value systems. This shocked Rua, as he had banned p\u0101keh\u0101 schools from the original community. The costs of defence at the various trials had ruined the community financially as it had to sell stock and land to meet the debt. The community was even ordered to pay the costs of the entire police operations and raid at Maungap\u014dhatu . Even though the supreme court had found Rua's arrest illegal and a legal petition had been drafted to Parliament on 1 May 1917 on behalf of the Maungap\u014dhatu people calling for a full public inquiry into the events of 2 April 1916, and the behaviour of the police there and later intimidating witnesses, no compensation was ever offered to Maungap\u014dhatu.<ref>Mihaia : the prophet Rua Kenana and his community at Maungapohatu ([[Judith Binney]] with Gillian Chaplin and Craig Wallace. Oxford University Press, 1979, pages 131-132</ref>\n\nEventually Rua moved downstream to Matahi, a community he had founded on the [[Waimana River]] in the eastern Bay of Plenty in 1910, where he lived until his death on 20 February 1937. He was survived by five wives, nine sons, and 13 daughters. Belief in his divinity did not long survive him, however, as he failed to fulfill his promise to rise from the dead. Little now remains of Maungap\u014dhatu, and his church (Te Wairua Tapu) boasts few followers. The Urewera Country is peaceful, a  contrast to what it was in the days of the Prophet Rua.<ref>[http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/R/RuaTapunuiHepetipaOrKenanaRuaHepetipa/RuaTapunuiHepetipaOrKenanaRuaHepetipa/en RUA TAPUNUI HEPETIPA, or KENANA RUA HEPETIPA \u2013 1966 Encyclopaedia of New Zealand<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Pardon==\n{{main|Rua K\u0113nana Pardon Act 2019}}\n[[File:Rua K\u0113nana Pardon Act royal assent.jpg|thumb|right|The governor-general, Dame [[Patsy Reddy]] gives royal assent to the Rua K\u0113nana Pardon Act 2019 at [[Maungapohatu|Maungap\u014dhatu]] on 21 December 2019, while [[T\u016bheitia Paki]], the M\u0101ori king, watches on]]\nIn September 2017, the government committed to pardon him as part of a treaty settlement.<ref name=\":0\" /> The bill giving effect to the pardon was introduced to Parliament on 22 August 2019, received its [[third reading]] on 18 December 2019, and was given [[royal assent]] three days later by the governor-general, Dame [[Patsy Reddy]], at Maungap\u014dhatu.<ref name=progress >{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/BILL_91057/te-pire-kia-unuhia-te-hara-kai-runga-i-a-rua-k%C4%93nana-rua|title=Te Pire kia Unuhia te Hara kai Runga i a Rua K\u0113nana / Rua K\u0113nana Pardon Bill - New Zealand Parliament|website=www.parliament.nz}}</ref>\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Judith Binney]],  Gillian Chaplin and Craig Wallace ''Mihaia: The prophet Rua Kenana and his community at Maungapohatu''.
