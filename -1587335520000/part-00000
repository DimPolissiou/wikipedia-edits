The term ''vitamin C'' encompasses several [[vitamer]]s that have vitamin C activity in animals. Ascorbate salts such as sodium ascorbate and calcium ascorbate are used in some dietary supplements. These release ascorbate upon digestion. Ascorbate and ascorbic acid are both naturally present in the body, since the forms interconvert according to [[pH]]. Oxidized forms of the molecule such as [[dehydroascorbic acid]] are converted back to ascorbic acid by reducing agents.<ref name=\"DRItext\" />\n\nVitamin C functions as a [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] in many [[enzyme|enzymatic]] reactions in animals (and humans) that mediate a variety of essential biological functions, including [[wound healing]] and [[collagen]] synthesis. In humans, vitamin C deficiency leads to impaired [[collagen]] synthesis, contributing to the more severe symptoms of [[scurvy]].<ref name=\"DRItext\" /> Another biochemical role of vitamin C is to act as an [[antioxidant]] (a [[reducing agent]]) by donating electrons to various enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions.<ref name=\"DRItext\" /> Doing so converts vitamin C to an oxidized state - either as semidehydroascorbic acid or [[dehydroascorbic acid]]. These compounds can be restored to a reduced state by [[glutathione]] and [[NADPH]]-dependent [[enzyme|enzymatic]] mechanisms.<ref name=\"pmid8144521\">{{cite journal |author=Meister A |title=Glutathione-ascorbic acid antioxidant system in animals |journal=J.

UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase uses the co-factor NAD<sup>+</sup> as the electron acceptor. The transferase UDP-glucuronate pyrophosphorylase removes a [[Uridine monophosphate|UMP]] and [[glucuronokinase]], with the cofactor ADP, removes the final phosphate leading to [[glucuronic acid|{{sm|d}}-glucuronic acid]]. The aldehyde group of this compound is reduced to a primary alcohol using the enzyme [[glucuronate reductase]] and the cofactor NADPH, yielding [[gulonic acid|{{sm|l}}-gulonic acid]]. This is followed by lactone formation{{Em dash}}utilizing the hydrolase [[gluconolactonase]]{{Em dash}}between the carbonyl on C1 and hydroxyl group on C4. {{sm|l}}-Gulonolactone then reacts with oxygen, catalyzed by the enzyme {{sm|l}}-gulonolactone oxidase (which is nonfunctional in humans and other [[Haplorrhini]] primates; see [[Pseudogene#Unitary pseudogenes|Unitary pseudogenes]]) and the cofactor FAD+.

The term ''vitamin C'' encompasses several [[vitamer]]s that have vitamin C activity in animals. Ascorbate salts such as sodium ascorbate and calcium ascorbate are used in some dietary supplements. These release ascorbate upon digestion. Ascorbate and ascorbic acid are both naturally present in the body, since the forms interconvert according to [[pH]]. Oxidized forms of the molecule such as [[dehydroascorbic acid]] are converted back to ascorbic acid by reducing agents.<ref name=\"DRItext\" />\n\nVitamin C functions as a [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] in many [[enzyme|enzymatic]] reactions in animals (and humans) that mediate a variety of essential biological functions, including [[wound healing]] and [[collagen]] synthesis. In humans, vitamin C deficiency leads to impaired [[collagen]] synthesis, contributing to the more severe symptoms of [[scurvy]].<ref name=\"DRItext\" /> Another biochemical role of vitamin C is to act as an [[antioxidant]] (a [[reducing agent]]) by donating electrons to various enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions.<ref name=\"DRItext\" /> Doing so converts vitamin C to an oxidized state - either as semidehydroascorbic acid or [[dehydroascorbic acid]]. These compounds can be restored to a reduced state by [[glutathione]] and [[NADPH]]-dependent [[enzyme|enzymatic]] mechanisms.<ref name=\"pmid8144521\">{{cite journal |author=Meister A |title=Glutathione-ascorbic acid antioxidant system in animals |journal=J.

UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase uses the co-factor NAD<sup>+</sup> as the electron acceptor. The transferase UDP-glucuronate pyrophosphorylase removes a [[Uridine monophosphate|UMP]] and [[glucuronokinase]], with the cofactor ADP, removes the final phosphate leading to [[glucuronic acid|{{sm|d}}-glucuronic acid]]. The aldehyde group of this compound is reduced to a primary alcohol using the enzyme [[glucuronate reductase]] and the cofactor NADPH, yielding [[gulonic acid|{{sm|l}}-gulonic acid]]. This is followed by lactone formation{{Em dash}}utilizing the hydrolase [[gluconolactonase]]{{Em dash}}between the carbonyl on C1 and hydroxyl group on C4. {{sm|l}}-Gulonolactone then reacts with oxygen, catalyzed by the enzyme {{sm|l}}-gulonolactone oxidase (which is nonfunctional in humans and other [[Haplorrhini]] primates; see [[Pseudogene#Unitary pseudogenes|Unitary pseudogenes]]) and the cofactor FAD+.

The torch is depicted on both the NYU seal and the more abstract NYU logo, designed in 1965 by renowned graphic designer [[Tom Geismar]] of the branding and design firm [[Chermayeff & Geismar]]. There are at least two versions of the possible origin of the university color, [[Violet (color)|violet]]. Some believe that it may have been chosen because [[Violet (plant)|violets]] are said to have grown abundantly in Washington Square and around the buttresses of the Old University Building. Others argue that the color may have been adopted because the violet was the flower associated with [[Athens]], the center of learning in [[ancient Greece]].\n\n===Cultural setting===\n[[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] and [[Greenwich Village]] have been hubs of [[cultural learning|cultural life]] in New York City since the early 19th century. Much of this culture has intersected with NYU at various points in its history. [[Artist]]s of the [[Hudson River School]], the United States' first prominent school of painters, settled around Washington Square. [[Samuel F.B. Morse]], a noted artist who also pioneered the telegraph and created the Morse Code, served as the first chair of Painting and Sculpture. He and [[Daniel Huntington (artist)|Daniel Huntington]] were early tenants of the Old University Building in the mid-19th century. (The university rented out studio space and residential apartments within the \"academic\" building.) As a result, they had notable interaction with the cultural and academic life of the university.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/>\n\nIn the 1870s, sculptors [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] and [[Daniel Chester French]] lived and worked near the Square. By the 1920s, [[Washington Square Park]] was nationally recognized as a focal point for artistic and moral rebellion. As such, the Washington Square campus became more diverse and bustled with urban energy, contributing to academic change at NYU.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> Famed residents of this time include [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]], and [[Maurice Prendergast]]. In the 1930s, the abstract expressionists [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], and the realists [[Edward Hopper]] and [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] had studios around Washington Square. In the 1960s the area became one of the centers of the beat and folk generation, when [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Bob Dylan]] settled there. This led to tension with the university, which at the time was in the midst of an aggressive facilities expansion phase.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> In 1975, the university opened The [[Grey Art Gallery]] at 100 Washington Square East, housing the NYU art collection and featuring museum quality exhibitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/collection/collection.html|title=Home -

The torch is depicted on both the NYU seal and the more abstract NYU logo, designed in 1965 by renowned graphic designer [[Tom Geismar]] of the branding and design firm [[Chermayeff & Geismar]]. There are at least two versions of the possible origin of the university color, [[Violet (color)|violet]]. Some believe that it may have been chosen because [[Violet (plant)|violets]] are said to have grown abundantly in Washington Square and around the buttresses of the Old University Building. Others argue that the color may have been adopted because the violet was the flower associated with [[Athens]], the center of learning in [[ancient Greece]].\n\n===Cultural setting===\n[[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] and [[Greenwich Village]] have been hubs of [[cultural learning|cultural life]] in New York City since the early 19th century. Much of this culture has intersected with NYU at various points in its history. [[Artist]]s of the [[Hudson River School]], the United States' first prominent school of painters, settled around Washington Square. [[Samuel F.B. Morse]], a noted artist who also pioneered the telegraph and created the Morse Code, served as the first chair of Painting and Sculpture. He and [[Daniel Huntington (artist)|Daniel Huntington]] were early tenants of the Old University Building in the mid-19th century. (The university rented out studio space and residential apartments within the \"academic\" building.) As a result, they had notable interaction with the cultural and academic life of the university.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/>\n\nIn the 1870s, sculptors [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] and [[Daniel Chester French]] lived and worked near the Square. By the 1920s, [[Washington Square Park]] was nationally recognized as a focal point for artistic and moral rebellion. As such, the Washington Square campus became more diverse and bustled with urban energy, contributing to academic change at NYU.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> Famed residents of this time include [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]], and [[Maurice Prendergast]]. In the 1930s, the abstract expressionists [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], and the realists [[Edward Hopper]] and [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] had studios around Washington Square. In the 1960s the area became one of the centers of the beat and folk generation, when [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Bob Dylan]] settled there. This led to tension with the university, which at the time was in the midst of an aggressive facilities expansion phase.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> In 1975, the university opened The [[Grey Art Gallery]] at 100 Washington Square East, housing the NYU art collection and featuring museum quality exhibitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/collection/collection.html|title=Home -

As a leading man for all but the first three years of his cinematic career, Scott appeared in a variety of genres, including social dramas, crime dramas, [[comedies]], [[musicals]] (albeit in non-singing and non-dancing roles), adventure tales, [[war films]], and a few [[Horror film|horror]] and [[fantasy]] films. However, his most enduring image is that of the tall-in-the-saddle [[Western (genre)|Western]] hero. Out of his more than 100 film appearances over 60 were in Westerns; thus, \"of all the major stars whose name was associated with the Western, Scott most closely identified with it.\"<ref name=\"BFI\">Boscombe 1988.{{page needed|date=July 2016}}</ref>\n\nScott's more than 30 years as a motion picture actor resulted in his working with many acclaimed screen directors, including [[Henry King (director)|Henry King]], [[Rouben Mamoulian]], [[Michael Curtiz]], [[John Cromwell (director)|John Cromwell]], [[King Vidor]], [[Allan Dwan]], [[Fritz Lang]], [[Sam Peckinpah]], [[Henry Hathaway]] (eight times), [[Ray Enright]] (seven), [[Edwin L. Marin]] (seven), [[Andre DeToth]] (six), and most notably, his seven film collaborations with [[Budd Boetticher]]. Scott also worked with a diverse array of cinematic leading ladies, from [[Shirley Temple]] and [[Irene Dunne]] to [[Mae West]] and [[Marlene Dietrich]].\n\nTall (6&nbsp;ft 2\u00bd in; 189&nbsp;cm), lanky and handsome, Scott displayed an easygoing charm and courtly Southern drawl in his early films that helped offset his limitations as an actor, where he was frequently found to be stiff or \"lumbering\".<ref>Mueller 1985, p. 65.</ref> As he matured, however, Scott's acting improved while his features became burnished and leathery, turning him into the ideal \"strong, silent\" type of stoic hero. ''The BFI Companion to the Western'' noted:<blockquote>In his earlier Westerns&nbsp;... the Scott persona is debonair, easy-going, graceful, though with the necessary hint of steel. As he matures into his fifties his roles change. Increasingly Scott becomes the man who has seen it all, who has suffered pain, loss, and hardship, and who has now achieved (but at what cost?) a stoic calm proof against vicissitude.<ref name=\"BFI\"/></blockquote>\n\nDuring the early 1950s, Scott was a consistent box-office draw. In the annual ''Motion Picture Herald'' [[Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll|Top Ten Polls]], he ranked 10th in 1950, seventh in 1951, and 10th in both 1952 and 1953.<ref>Nott 2004, p. 4.</ref> Scott also appeared in the Quigley's ''Top Ten Money Makers Poll'' from 1950 to 1953.<ref>[http://www.quigleypublishing.com/MPalmanac/Top10/Top10_lists.html \"Top Ten Money Making Stars of the past 79 years.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221063625/http://www.quigleypublishing.com/MPalmanac/Top10/Top10_lists.html |date=2014-12-21 }} ''quigleypublishing.com.'' Retrieved: June 9, 2012.</ref>\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Early years==\nScott was born in [[Orange County, Virginia]], but reared in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], the second of six children born to parents of Scottish descent. His father was George Grant Scott, born in [[Franklin, Virginia]], an administrative engineer in a textile firm. His mother was Lucille Crane Scott, born in [[Luray, Virginia|Luray]], Virginia, a member of a wealthy North Carolina family.<ref name=\"Nott p. 7\">Nott 2004, p. 7.</ref> The Scott children in order of birth were: Margaret, Randolph, Katherine, Virginia, Joseph and Barbara, most born in North Carolina.<ref>U.S. Census 1900\u20131920.</ref>\n\nBecause of his family's financial status, young Randolph was able to attend private schools such as [[Woodberry Forest School]]. From an early age, Scott developed and displayed his athleticism, excelling in [[american football|football]], baseball, horse racing, and swimming.<ref name=\"Nott p. 7\"/>\n\n==World War I==\nIn April 1917, the United States entered [[World War I]] and shortly afterwards, Scott, then  19 years old, joined the [[United States Army]]. He served in France as an artillery observer with the 2nd Trench Mortar Battalion, [[19th Field Artillery Regiment]].<ref>Nott 2004, p. 1.</ref> His wartime experience gave him training that was put to use in his later film career,  including [[horsemanship]] and the use of [[firearms]].\n\n==After World War I==\nAfter the [[Armistice]] brought [[World War I]] to an end, Scott stayed in France and  enrolled in an artillery officers' school. Although he eventually received a commission, Scott decided to return to America and thus journeyed home around 1919.<ref name=\"Nott p. 8\">Nott 2004, p. 8.</ref>\n\nWith his military career over, Scott continued his education at [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] where he was a member of the Kappa Alpha Order and set his sights on becoming an all-American football player. However a back injury prevented him from achieving this goal.<ref name=\"Thomas\">Thomas 1981 {{page needed|date=July 2016}}</ref> Scott then transferred to the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]], where he majored in [[textile engineering]] and manufacturing.<ref name=\"Nott p. 8\"/> As with his military career, however, he eventually dropped out of college and went to work as an accountant in the textile firm where his father was employed.<ref>Ringgold, Gene. \"Randolph Scott: Everyone's Idea of a Southern Gentleman.\" ''Films in Review.'' 1972.</ref>\n\n==Stage and early film appearances==\n{{More citations needed|section|date=July 2017}}\n\n===Early films===\nAround 1927, Scott developed an interest in acting and decided to make his way to Los Angeles and seek a career in the motion picture industry. Fortunately, Scott's father had become acquainted with [[Howard Hughes]] and provided a letter of introduction for his son to present to the eccentric millionaire filmmaker.<ref name=\"Thomas\"/> Hughes responded by getting Scott a small part in a [[George O'Brien (actor)|George O'Brien]] film called ''[[Sharp Shooters]]'' (1928). Despite its title and the presence of O'Brien, ''Sharp Shooters'' is not a western, as some film historians claimed. Rather, it's a romantic comedy. A print of the film survives in the [[UCLA Film and Television Archive]].\n\nIn the next few years, Scott continued working as an extra and bit player in several films, including ''Weary River'' (1929) with [[Richard Barthelmess]], ''[[The Far Call]]'' (1929), ''[[The Black Watch]]'' (1929) (directed by [[John Ford]] with [[John Wayne]] also uncredited) and uncredited as the Rider in ''[[The Virginian (1929 film)|The Virginian]]'' (1929) with [[Gary Cooper]]. Reputedly, Scott also served as Cooper's dialect coach in this latter film.\n\nScott was also uncredited on ''[[Dynamite (1929 film)|Dynamite]]'' (1929) directed by [[Cecil B. De Mille]], and ''[[Born Reckless (1930 film)|Born Reckless]]'' (1930).\n\n===Stage===\nOn the advice of director [[Cecil B. DeMille]], Scott gained much-needed acting experience by performing in stage plays with the [[Pasadena Playhouse]]. Scott's stage roles during this period include:<ref>Nott 2004, p. 136.</ref>\n* A minister in ''Gentlemen Be Seated''\n* A butler in ''Nellie, the Beautiful Model''\n* Metellus Cimber in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''\n* Hector Malone in [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Man and Superman]]''\n\nIn 1931 Scott played his first leading role (with [[Sally Blane]]) in ''[[Women Men Marry]]'' (1931), a [[lost film|film]], now apparently lost, that was made by a [[Poverty Row]] studio called Headline Pictures. A silent film by the same name from 1922, directed by Edward Dillon, has apparently been preserved, however, at Filmmuseum Amsterdam. The Library of Congress American Silent Feature Film Survival Catalog:..Women Men Marry.\n\nHe followed that movie with a supporting part in a [[Warner Bros.]] production starring [[George Arliss]], ''[[A Successful Calamity]]'' (1932).\n\nIn 1932 Scott appeared in a play at the Vine Street Theatre in [[Hollywood]] entitled ''Under a Virginia Moon''. His performance in this play resulted in several offers for screen tests by the major movie studios.<ref name=\"Thomas\"/> Scott eventually signed a seven-year contract with [[Paramount Pictures]] at a salary of USD $400 per week ({{Inflation|USD|400|1932|r=-2|fmt=eq}}).<ref>Nott 2004, p. 10.</ref>\n\n==Paramount==\n===Zane Grey apprenticeship===\n[[File:Poster - Man of the Forest (1933) 02.jpg|thumb|right|With [[Verna Hillie]] in ''[[Man of the Forest (1933 film)|Man of the Forest]]'', 1933]]\n[[File:Poster - Man of the Forest (1933) 05 (1).jpg|thumb|right|[[Barton MacLane]], [[Tom Kennedy (actor)|Tom Kennedy]], [[Noah Beery, Sr.]], Scott and [[Verna Hillie]] in ''Man of the Forest'', 1933]]\n[[File:Poster - Man of the Forest (1933) 09.jpg|thumb|right|[[Noah Beery, Sr.]] and Scott in ''Man of the Forest'', 1933]]\nScott's first role under his new [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] contract was a small supporting part in a comedy called ''[[Sky Bride]]'' (1932) starring [[Richard Arlen]] and [[Jack Oakie]].\n\nFollowing that, however, Paramount cast him as the lead in ''[[Heritage of the Desert (1932 film)|Heritage of the Desert]]'' (1932), his first significant starring role and also the one that established him as a [[Western (genre)|Western]] hero. As with ''Women Men Marry'', [[Sally Blane]] was his leading lady. [[Henry Hathaway]] made his directorial debut with ''Heritage of the Desert''. The film was popular and Scott would go on to make ten \"B\" [[Western (genre)|Western]] films loosely based on the novels of [[Zane Grey]].\n\n(Around the same time, [[Fox Film Corporation|Fox]] also remade some [[Zane Grey]] titles that they owned, with [[George O'Brien (actor)|George O'Brien]] as their star.)\n\nMany of these Grey adaptations were remakes of earlier silent films. In an effort to save on production costs, Paramount utilized stock footage from the silent version and even hired some of the same actors, such as [[Raymond Hatton]] and [[Noah Beery, Sr.|Noah Beery]], to repeat their roles. For the 1933 films ''[[The Thundering Herd (1933 film)|The Thundering Herd]]'' and ''[[Man of the Forest (1933 film)|Man of the Forest]]'', Scott's hair was darkened and he sported a trim moustache so that he could easily be matched to footage of [[Jack Holt (actor)|Jack Holt]], the star of the silent versions.\n\nIn his book, ''The Hollywood Western: Ninety Years of Cowboys and Indians, Train Robbers, Sheriffs and Gunslingers'', film historian [[William K. Everson]] refers to the Zane Grey series as being \"uniformly good\".<ref name=\"Everson\">Everson, William K. ''The Hollywood Western: Ninety Years of Cowboys and Indians, Train Robbers, Sheriffs and Gunslingers.'' New York. Citadel Press, 1992, First edition 1969.</ref> He also writes:<blockquote>''To the Last Man'' was almost a model of its kind, an exceptionally strong story of feuding families in the post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] era, with a cast worthy of an \"A\" feature, excellent direction by [[Henry Hathaway]], and an unusual climactic fight between the villain (Jack LaRue) and the ''heroine'' ([[Esther Ralston]], in an exceptionally appealing performance).\n\n''Sunset Pass''...&nbsp;was not only one of the best but also one of the most surprising in presenting Randolph Scott and [[Harry Carey (actor born 1878)|Harry Carey]] as ''heavies.''</blockquote>\n\nThe Zane Grey series were a boon for Scott, as they provided him with \"an excellent training ground for both action and acting\".<ref>Nott 2005, p. 9.</ref>\n\nIn between his work in the Zane Grey [[Western (genre)|Western]] series, Paramount cast Scott in several non-[[Western (genre)|Western]] roles, such as \"the other man\" in ''[[Hot Saturday]]'' (1932), with [[Nancy Carroll]] and [[Cary Grant]].\n\nScott returned to Zane Grey Westerns with ''[[Wild Horse Mesa (1932 film)|Wild Horse Mesa]]'' (1932), then was the romantic male lead in ''[[Hello, Everybody!]]'' (1933), an odd one-shot attempt to make a film star out of the popular but heavy-set radio singer [[Kate Smith]].\n\n''[[The Thundering Herd (1933 film)|The Thundering Herd]]'' (1933) was another Zane Grey Western with Hathaway, then he was in two horror movies, ''[[Murders in the Zoo]]'' (1933) with [[Lionel Atwill]] and ''[[Supernatural (film)|Supernatural]]'' (1933) with [[Carole Lombard]].\n\nAfter the Western ''[[Sunset Pass (1933 film)|Sunset Pass]]'' (1933), Paramount loaned Scott to [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]], to play [[Bebe Daniels]]'s love interest in a minor romantic comedy called ''[[Cocktail Hour (film)|Cocktail Hour]]'' (1933).\n\nBack at Paramount Scott did the Westerns ''[[Man of the Forest (1933 film)|Man of the Forest]]'' (1933) and ''[[To the Last Man (1933 film)|To the Last Man]]'' (1933), both with Hathaway from Grey novels. He was loaned to [[Monogram Pictures]] for ''[[Broken Dreams (1933 film)|Broken Dreams]]'' (1933) then was back with Hathaway for ''[[The Last Round-Up (1934 film)|The Last Round-Up]]'' (1934).\n\nScott did three more Zane Grey Westerns without Hathaway: ''[[Wagon Wheels (film)|Wagon Wheels]]'' (1934) directed by [[Charles Barton (director)|Charles Barton]], ''[[Home on the Range (1935 film)|Home on the Range]]'' (1935) from [[Arthur Jacobson]], and ''[[Rocky Mountain Mystery]]'' (1935) with Barton.\n\n===RKO and \"A\" Films===\nParamount loaned Scott to [[RKO Pictures|RKO Radio Pictures]] to support [[Fred Astaire]], [[Ginger Rogers]] and [[Irene Dunne]] in ''[[Roberta (1935 film)|Roberta]]'' (1935), a hugely popular adaptation of the Broadway musical.\n\nRKO liked Scott and kept him on for ''[[Village Tale]]'' (1935), directed by John Cromwell, and ''[[She (1935 film)|She]]'' (1935), an adaptation of [[She (novel)|the classic novel]] by [[H. Rider Haggard]] from the makers of ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]''.\n\nScott went back to Paramount for ''[[So Red the Rose (film)|So Red the Rose]]'' (1935) with [[Margaret Sullavan]], then was reunited with Astaire and Rogers at RKO in ''[[Follow the Fleet]]'' (1936).<ref>Nott 2004, p. 43.</ref> It was another big hit.<ref name=\"rko\">Richard Jewel, 'RKO Film Grosses: 1931-1951', ''Historical Journal of Film Radio and Television'', Vol 14 No 1, 1994 p55</ref>\n\nScott was in a car drama at Paramount, ''[[And Sudden Death]]'' (1936), directed by Barton, then was loaned to independent producer [[Edward Small]], to play [[Natty Bumppo|Hawkeye]] in another adventure classic, ''[[The Last of the Mohicans (1936 film)|The Last of the Mohicans]]'', adapted from the 1826 [[The Last of the Mohicans|novel]] by [[James Fenimore Cooper]]. A big hit in its day, the film \"gave Scott his first unqualified 'A' picture success as a lead.\"<ref>Nott 2004, p. 58.</ref>\n\nParamount now only put Scott in \"A\" films. He was a love interest for [[Mae West]] in ''[[Go West, Young Man]]'' (1936) and was reunited with Irene Dunne in a musical, ''[[High, Wide, and Handsome]]'' (1937). This last film, a musical directed by [[Rouben Mamoulian]], featured Scott in his \"most ambitious performance,\"<ref>Nott 2004, p. 59.</ref> The film is&nbsp;...\n<blockquote>...&nbsp;set in 1859 in [[Pennsylvania]], and follows the exploits of oil prospector Scott as he struggles against various varmints and vested interests out to wreck his business, and tries to keep his marriage to [[Irene Dunne]] intact, despite the tempting presence of saloon singer [[Dorothy Lamour]].<ref name=\"BFI\"/></blockquote>\n\nScott went to [[20th Century Fox]] to play the romantic male lead in a [[Shirley Temple]] film, ''[[Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1938 film)|Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm]]'' (1938). At Paramount he made a well budgeted Western ''[[The Texans]]'' (1938) with [[Joan Bennett]] then he starred in ''[[The Road to Reno (1938 film)|The Road to Reno]]'' (1938) at Universal.\n\nOne missed opportunity came about around this time. Due to his Southern background, Scott was considered for the role of [[Ashley Wilkes]] in ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', but it was [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]] who eventually got the part.\n\n==20th Century Fox==\nScott's contract with Paramount ended and he signed a deal with Fox. They put him in ''[[Jesse James (1939 film)|Jesse James]]'' (1939), a lavish highly romanticized account of the famous [[Jesse James|outlaw]] ([[Tyrone Power]]) and his brother [[Frank James|Frank]] ([[Henry Fonda]]). Scott was billed fourth as a sympathetic marshal after the James brothers; it was his first film in color.\n\nScott was reunited with Temple in ''[[Susannah of the Mounties (film)|Susannah of the Mounties]]'' (1939), Temple's last profitable film for Fox. The studio gave him the lead in ''[[Frontier Marshal (1939 film)|Frontier Marshal]]'' (1939), playing [[Wyatt Earp]].\n\nScott went to Columbia to star in a medium budget action film, ''[[Coast Guard (film)|Coast Guard]]'' (1939). Back at Fox he was in a war movie, ''[[20,000 Men a Year]]'' (1939).\n\nScott went over to Warner Bros to make ''[[Virginia City (film)|Virginia City]]'' (1940), billed third after [[Errol Flynn]] and [[Miriam Hopkins]], playing Flynn's antagonist, a Confederate officer - but a sympathetic one, and not the actual villain (he was played by [[Humphrey Bogart]]). There were frequent disputes between director [[Michael Curtiz]], actors and producer [[Hal Wallis]] about script changes. But Curtiz recalled that Scott tried to stay out of those arguments: \"Randy Scott is a complete anachronism,\" said Curtiz. \"He's a gentleman. And so far he's the only one I've met in this business...\"<ref name=\"Nott 2004 p. 84\">Nott 2004 p. 84</ref> According to Nott, Curtiz and Scott got along well both personally and creatively, with Scott giving one of the top performances in his career.<ref name=\"Nott 2004 p. 84\"/>\n\nScott went back to RKO to play the \"other man\" role in the [[Irene Dunne]]\u2013[[Cary Grant]] romantic comedy ''[[My Favorite Wife]]'' (1940), a huge hit for RKO. For [[Universal Studios|Universal]], he starred with [[Kay Francis]] in ''[[When the Daltons Rode]]'' (1940).\n\nBack at Fox, Scott returned to [[Zane Grey]] country by co-starring with [[Robert Young (actor)|Robert Young]] in the [[Technicolor]] production ''[[Western Union (film)|Western Union]]'', directed by [[Fritz Lang]]. Scott played a \"good bad man\" in this film and gave one of his finest performances. [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote:\n<blockquote>Randolph Scott, who begins to look and act more and more like [[William S. Hart]], herein shapes one of the truest and most appreciable characters of his career as the party's scout.<ref>''[[The New York Times]],'' February 7, 1941.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1941, Scott also co-starred with a young [[Gene Tierney]] in another western, ''[[Belle Starr (film)|Belle Starr]]''.  After a spy film with [[Elisabeth Bergner]], ''[[Paris Calling]]'' (1941), he was in a hugely popular war film at Fox with John Payne and [[Maureen O'Hara]], ''[[To the Shores of Tripoli]]'' (1942).\n\n==Universal==\nScott's only role as a truly evil villain was in [[Universal Studios|Universal]]'s ''[[The Spoilers (1942 film)|The Spoilers]]'' (1942), an adaptation of [[Rex Beach]]'s 1905 tale of the [[Klondike gold rush|Alaskan gold rush]] also starring [[Marlene Dietrich]] and [[John Wayne]]. \n\nThe [[Marlene Dietrich|Dietrich]]-Scott-[[John Wayne|Wayne]] combination led to [[Universal Studios|Universal]] casting the trio that same year in ''[[Pittsburgh (1942 film)|Pittsburgh]]'', a war-time action-melodrama.  Scott was billed above Wayne in both films but Wayne actually played the heroic [[leading man]] roles and enjoyed more screen time in each movie.\n\n==World War II==\nShortly after the United States entered World War II, Scott attempted to obtain an officer's commission in the [[United States Marines|Marines]], but because of a back injury years earlier, he was rejected.<ref name=\"Thomas\"/> However, he did his part for the war effort by touring in a comedy act with [[Joe DeRita]] (who later became a member of [[the Three Stooges]]) for the Victory Committee showcases, and he also raised food for the government on a ranch that he owned.<ref>Nott 2004, p. 67.</ref>\n\nIn 1942 and 1943, Scott appeared in several war films, notably ''To the Shores of Tripoli'' (1942) at Fox, ''[[Bombardier (film)|Bombardier]]'' (1943) at RKO, the Canadian warship drama ''[[Corvette K-225]]'' (1943) (produced by [[Howard Hawks]]), ''[[Gung Ho! (1943 film)|Gung Ho!]]'' at Universal <ref>{{Citation|title=Bugs Bunny-War Bonds|date=1943|url=https://archive.org/details/GungHo-1943Trailer|accessdate=2017-09-21}}</ref> and ''[[China Sky (film)|China Sky]]'' (1945) at RKO.\n\nHe also made ''[[The Desperadoes]]'' (1943), [[Columbia Pictures]]' first feature in [[Technicolor]]. The film was produced by [[Harry Joe Brown]], with whom Scott would form a business partnership several years later.\n\nScott was one of many Universal stars who made a cameo in ''[[Follow the Boys]]'' (1944). He was in a \"northern\" with [[Gypsy Rose Lee]], ''[[Belle of the Yukon]]'' (1944), and made a [[swashbuckler]] film for producer [[Benedict Bogeaus]] alongside [[Charles Laughton]]: the cheaply made production ''[[Captain Kidd (1945 film)|Captain Kidd]]'' (1945).\n\n==Post-World War II career==\n===Tall in the saddle===\n[[File:Abilene Town 1946 (2).jpg|thumb|With Jack Lambert in ''Abilene Town'', 1946]]\nIn 1946, after playing roles that had him wandering in and out of the saddle for many years, Scott appeared in ''[[Abilene Town]]'', a [[United Artists|UA]]<ref>Gritten  2008, p. 8.</ref> release which cast him in what would become one of his classic images, the fearless lawman cleaning up a lawless town. The film \"cemented Scott's position as a cowboy hero\"<ref>Nott 2005, p. 15.</ref> and from this point on all but two of his starring films would be [[Westerns]]. The Scott Westerns of the late 1940s would each be budgeted around US$1,000,000, equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1000000|1946|r=-5}}}} today. Scott mostly made Westerns for producers [[Nat Holt]] or [[Harry Joe Brown]] or at [[Warner Bros]], although he did make ''[[Albuquerque (film)|Albuquerque]]'' (1948) at Paramount.\n\n===Non-Westerns===\nScott's last non-Westerns were a mystery with [[Peggy Ann Garner]] at Fox, ''[[Home Sweet Homicide]]'' (1947), and a family drama for Bogeaus, ''[[Christmas Eve (1947 film)|Christmas Eve]]'' (1947). He also had a cameo in Warners' ''[[Starlift]]'' (1951).\n\n===Nat Holt===\nScott did two Westerns for Nat Holt at RKO, ''[[Badman's Territory]]'' (1946) and ''[[Trail Street]]'' (1947). He followed it with another pair for Holt at that studio, ''[[Return of the Bad Men]]'' (1948) at RKO and ''[[Canadian Pacific (film)|Canadian Pacific]]'' (1949), then they did ''[[Fighting Man of the Plains]]'' (1950) and ''[[The Cariboo Trail]]'' (1950) at Fox.\n\nScott also made ''[[Rage at Dawn]]'' in 1955 for Nat Holt, which was released by [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] starring Scott and [[Forrest Tucker]], and featuring [[Denver Pyle]], [[Edgar Buchanan]], and [[J. Carrol Naish]]. It purports to tell the true story of the [[Reno Gang|Reno Brothers]], an outlaw gang which terrorized the American Midwest, particularly Southern [[Indiana]], soon after the [[American Civil War]].\n\n===Harry Joe Brown===\nScott renewed his acquaintance with producer [[Harry Joe Brown]] at Columbia with ''[[Gunfighters (film)|Gunfighters]]'' (1947). They began producing many of Scott's Westerns, including several that were shot in the two-color [[Cinecolor]] process. Their collaboration resulted in the film ''[[Coroner Creek]]'' (1948) with Scott as a vengeance-driven cowpoke who \"predates the [[Budd Boetticher]]/[[Burt Kennedy]] heroes by nearly a decade,\"<ref>Nott 2005, p. 29.</ref> and ''[[The Walking Hills]]'' (1949), a modern-day tale of gold hunters directed by [[John Sturges]].\n\nThey followed it with ''[[The Doolins of Oklahoma]]'' (1949), ''[[The Nevadan]]'' (1950), ''[[Santa Fe (film)|Santa Fe]]'' (1951), ''[[Man in the Saddle (1951 film)|Man in the Saddle]]'' (1951), ''[[Hangman's Knot]]'' (1952), ''[[The Stranger Wore a Gun]]'' (1953) (shot in 3-D), ''[[Ten Wanted Men]]'' (1955), and ''[[A Lawless Street]]'' (1955) (with [[Angela Lansbury]].)\n\n===Warner Bros.===\nScott did ''[[Colt .45 (film)|Colt .45]]'' (1950) at [[Warner Bros.]] where his salary was US$100,000 per picture (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|100000|1949|r=-5}}}} today). He stayed at the studio to do ''[[Sugarfoot (film)|Sugarfoot]]'' (1951), ''[[Fort Worth (film)|Fort Worth]]'' (1951), ''[[Carson City (film)|Carson City]]'' (1952), ''[[The Man Behind the Gun]]'' (1953), ''[[Thunder Over the Plains]]'' (1953), ''[[Riding Shotgun (film)|Riding Shotgun]]'' (1954), ''[[Tall Man Riding]]'' (1955) Most of  these were directed by [[Andr\u00e9 de Toth]].\n\nAlso of interest is ''[[Shootout at Medicine Bend]]'' shot in 1955, but released in 1957, which was Scott's last movie in black and white. The movie co-stars [[James Garner]] and [[Angie Dickinson]].<ref>Gritten 2008, p. 1071.</ref>\n\nBy 1956, Scott turned 58, an age where the careers of most leading men would be winding down. Scott, however, was about to enter his finest and most acclaimed period.\n\n===Boetticher and Kennedy films===\n[[File:Nancy Gates and Randolph Scott in Comanche Station.png|thumb|upright=1.3|With Nancy Gates in ''[[Comanche Station]]'', 1960]]\nIn 1955, screenwriter [[Burt Kennedy]] wrote a script entitled ''[[Seven Men from Now]]'' which was scheduled to be filmed by [[John Wayne]]'s [[Batjac Productions]] with Wayne as the film's star and [[Budd Boetticher]] as its director. However, Wayne was already committed to [[John Ford]]'s ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]''. Wayne therefore suggested Scott as his replacement.<ref>Nott 2005, p. 131.</ref> The resulting film, released in 1956, did not make a great impact at the time but is now regarded by many as one of Scott's best, as well as the one that launched Scott and Boetticher into a successful collaboration that totaled seven films.\n\nWhile each film is independent and there are no shared characters or settings, this set of films is often called the Ranown Cycle, for the production company run by Scott and Harry Joe Brown, which was involved in their production.<ref>Wilmington, Michael. [http://articles.latimes.com/1992-11-29/entertainment/ca-2438_1_budd-boetticher \"Tall in the director's chair Budd Boetticher made some of the best-remembered westerns of '50s and '60s; they don't make 'em like that (or him) anymore.\"] ''Los Angeles Times,'' November 29, 1992, p. 4.</ref> Kennedy scripted four of them. In these films&nbsp;...\n<blockquote>Boetticher achieved works of great beauty, formally precise in structure and visually elegant, notably for their use of the distinctive landscape of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|California Sierras]]. As the hero of these \"floating poker games\" (as [[Andrew Sarris]] calls them), Scott tempers their innately pessimistic view with quiet, stoical humour, as he pits his wits against such charming villains as [[Richard Boone]] in ''[[The Tall T]]'' and [[Claude Akins]] in ''[[Comanche Station]].''<ref name=\"BFI\"/></blockquote>\n\nAfter ''[[7th Cavalry (film)|7th Cavalry]]'' (1956), Boetticher, Kennedy and Scott were reunited for their second film, ''[[The Tall T]]'' (1957) which co-starred [[Richard Boone]].\n\nThe third in the series was ''[[Decision at Sundown]]'' (1957), although that script was not written by Kennedy. The unofficial series continued with ''[[Buchanan Rides Alone]]'' (1958).\n\n''[[Westbound (film)|Westbound]]'' (1959) is not considered part of the official cycle although Boetticher directed it. However the last two, both written by Kennedy, definitely were: ''[[Ride Lonesome]]'' (1959) and ''[[Comanche Station]]'' (1960)\n\n===Last film: ''Ride the High Country''===\nIn 1962 Scott made his final film appearance in ''[[Ride the High Country]]'', a film now regarded as a classic. It was directed by [[Sam Peckinpah]] and co-starred [[Joel McCrea]], an actor who had a screen image similar to Scott's and who also from the mid-1940s on devoted his career almost exclusively to [[Westerns]].\n\n<blockquote>Scott and [[Joel McCrea|McCrea's]] farewell Western is characterized by a nostalgic sense of the passing of the Old West; a preoccupation with the emotionality of male bonding and of the experiential 'gap' between the young and the old; and the fearful evocation, in the form of the Hammonds (the villains in the film), of these preoccupations transmuted into brutal and perverse forms.<ref name=\"BFI\"/></blockquote>[[Joel McCrea|McCrea]], like Scott, retired from filmmaking after this picture, although he returned to the screen twice in later years.\n\n==Personal life==\n\n===Marriages===\nScott married twice. In 1936, he became the second husband of heiress [[Marion duPont Scott|Marion duPont]], daughter of William du Pont Sr., and great-granddaughter of \u00c9leuth\u00e8re Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e du Pont de Nemours, the founder of the [[E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company]]. Marion had previously married George Somerville, with Scott serving as best man at the wedding. The Scotts' marriage ended in divorce three years later, in 1939. The union produced no children. Though divorced, she kept his last name nearly five decades, until her death in 1983.<ref>Sargent, Sarah.

As a leading man for all but the first three years of his cinematic career, Scott appeared in a variety of genres, including social dramas, crime dramas, [[comedies]], [[musicals]] (albeit in non-singing and non-dancing roles), adventure tales, [[war films]], and a few [[Horror film|horror]] and [[fantasy]] films. However, his most enduring image is that of the tall-in-the-saddle [[Western (genre)|Western]] hero. Out of his more than 100 film appearances over 60 were in Westerns; thus, \"of all the major stars whose name was associated with the Western, Scott most closely identified with it.\"<ref name=\"BFI\">Boscombe 1988.{{page needed|date=July 2016}}</ref>\n\nScott's more than 30 years as a motion picture actor resulted in his working with many acclaimed screen directors, including [[Henry King (director)|Henry King]], [[Rouben Mamoulian]], [[Michael Curtiz]], [[John Cromwell (director)|John Cromwell]], [[King Vidor]], [[Allan Dwan]], [[Fritz Lang]], [[Sam Peckinpah]], [[Henry Hathaway]] (eight times), [[Ray Enright]] (seven), [[Edwin L. Marin]] (seven), [[Andre DeToth]] (six), and most notably, his seven film collaborations with [[Budd Boetticher]]. Scott also worked with a diverse array of cinematic leading ladies, from [[Shirley Temple]] and [[Irene Dunne]] to [[Mae West]] and [[Marlene Dietrich]].\n\nTall (6&nbsp;ft 2\u00bd in; 189&nbsp;cm), lanky and handsome, Scott displayed an easygoing charm and courtly Southern drawl in his early films that helped offset his limitations as an actor, where he was frequently found to be stiff or \"lumbering\".<ref>Mueller 1985, p. 65.</ref> As he matured, however, Scott's acting improved while his features became burnished and leathery, turning him into the ideal \"strong, silent\" type of stoic hero. ''The BFI Companion to the Western'' noted:<blockquote>In his earlier Westerns&nbsp;... the Scott persona is debonair, easy-going, graceful, though with the necessary hint of steel. As he matures into his fifties his roles change. Increasingly Scott becomes the man who has seen it all, who has suffered pain, loss, and hardship, and who has now achieved (but at what cost?) a stoic calm proof against vicissitude.<ref name=\"BFI\"/></blockquote>\n\nDuring the early 1950s, Scott was a consistent box-office draw. In the annual ''Motion Picture Herald'' [[Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll|Top Ten Polls]], he ranked 10th in 1950, seventh in 1951, and 10th in both 1952 and 1953.<ref>Nott 2004, p. 4.</ref> Scott also appeared in the Quigley's ''Top Ten Money Makers Poll'' from 1950 to 1953.<ref>[http://www.quigleypublishing.com/MPalmanac/Top10/Top10_lists.html \"Top Ten Money Making Stars of the past 79 years.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221063625/http://www.quigleypublishing.com/MPalmanac/Top10/Top10_lists.html |date=2014-12-21 }} ''quigleypublishing.com.''

His father was George Grant Scott, born in [[Franklin, Virginia]], an administrative engineer in a textile firm. His mother was Lucille Crane Scott, born in [[Luray, Virginia|Luray]], Virginia, a member of a wealthy North Carolina family.<ref name=\"Nott p. 7\">Nott 2004, p. 7.</ref> The Scott children in order of birth were: Margaret, Randolph, Katherine, Virginia, Joseph and Barbara, most born in North Carolina.<ref>U.S. Census 1900\u20131920.</ref>\n\nBecause of his family's financial status, young Randolph was able to attend private schools such as [[Woodberry Forest School]]. From an early age, Scott developed and displayed his athleticism, excelling in [[american football|football]], baseball, horse racing, and swimming.<ref name=\"Nott p. 7\"/>\n\n==World War I==\nIn April 1917, the United States entered [[World War I]] and shortly afterwards, Scott, then  19 years old, joined the [[United States Army]]. He served in France as an artillery observer with the 2nd Trench Mortar Battalion, [[19th Field Artillery Regiment]].<ref>Nott 2004, p. 1.</ref> His wartime experience gave him training that was put to use in his later film career,  including [[horsemanship]] and the use of [[firearms]].\n\n==After World War I==\nAfter the [[Armistice]] brought [[World War I]] to an end, Scott stayed in France and  enrolled in an artillery officers' school. Although he eventually received a commission, Scott decided to return to America and thus journeyed home around 1919.<ref name=\"Nott p. 8\">Nott 2004, p. 8.</ref>\n\nWith his military career over, Scott continued his education at [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] where he was a member of the Kappa Alpha Order and set his sights on becoming an all-American football player. However a back injury prevented him from achieving this goal.<ref name=\"Thomas\">Thomas 1981 {{page needed|date=July 2016}}</ref> Scott then transferred to the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]], where he majored in [[textile engineering]] and manufacturing.<ref name=\"Nott p. 8\"/> As with his military career, however, he eventually dropped out of college and went to work as an accountant in the textile firm where his father was employed.<ref>Ringgold, Gene. \"Randolph Scott: Everyone's Idea of a Southern Gentleman.\" ''Films in Review.'' 1972.</ref>\n\n==Stage and early film appearances==\n{{More citations needed|section|date=July 2017}}\n\n===Early films===\nAround 1927, Scott developed an interest in acting and decided to make his way to Los Angeles and seek a career in the motion picture industry. Fortunately, Scott's father had become acquainted with [[Howard Hughes]] and provided a letter of introduction for his son to present to the eccentric millionaire filmmaker.<ref name=\"Thomas\"/> Hughes responded by getting Scott a small part in a [[George O'Brien (actor)|George O'Brien]] film called ''[[Sharp Shooters]]'' (1928). Despite its title and the presence of O'Brien, ''Sharp Shooters'' is not a western, as some film historians claimed. Rather, it's a romantic comedy. A print of the film survives in the [[UCLA Film and Television Archive]].\n\nIn the next few years, Scott continued working as an extra and bit player in several films, including ''Weary River'' (1929) with [[Richard Barthelmess]], ''[[The Far Call]]'' (1929), ''[[The Black Watch]]'' (1929) (directed by [[John Ford]] with [[John Wayne]] also uncredited) and uncredited as the Rider in ''[[The Virginian (1929 film)|The Virginian]]'' (1929) with [[Gary Cooper]]. Reputedly, Scott also served as Cooper's dialect coach in this latter film.\n\nScott was also uncredited on ''[[Dynamite (1929 film)|Dynamite]]'' (1929) directed by [[Cecil B. De Mille]], and ''[[Born Reckless (1930 film)|Born Reckless]]'' (1930).\n\n===Stage===\nOn the advice of director [[Cecil B. DeMille]], Scott gained much-needed acting experience by performing in stage plays with the [[Pasadena Playhouse]]. Scott's stage roles during this period include:<ref>Nott 2004, p. 136.</ref>\n* A minister in ''Gentlemen Be Seated''\n* A butler in ''Nellie, the Beautiful Model''\n* Metellus Cimber in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''\n* Hector Malone in [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Man and Superman]]''\n\nIn 1931 Scott played his first leading role (with [[Sally Blane]]) in ''[[Women Men Marry]]'' (1931), a [[lost film|film]], now apparently lost, that was made by a [[Poverty Row]] studio called Headline Pictures. A silent film by the same name from 1922, directed by Edward Dillon, has apparently been preserved, however, at Filmmuseum Amsterdam. The Library of Congress American Silent Feature Film Survival Catalog:..Women Men Marry.\n\nHe followed that movie with a supporting part in a [[Warner Bros.]] production starring [[George Arliss]], ''[[A Successful Calamity]]'' (1932).\n\nIn 1932 Scott appeared in a play at the Vine Street Theatre in [[Hollywood]] entitled ''Under a Virginia Moon''. His performance in this play resulted in several offers for screen tests by the major movie studios.<ref name=\"Thomas\"/> Scott eventually signed a seven-year contract with [[Paramount Pictures]] at a salary of USD $400 per week ({{Inflation|USD|400|1932|r=-2|fmt=eq}}).<ref>Nott 2004, p. 10.</ref>\n\n==Paramount==\n===Zane Grey apprenticeship===\n[[File:Poster - Man of the Forest (1933) 02.jpg|thumb|right|With [[Verna Hillie]] in ''[[Man of the Forest (1933 film)|Man of the Forest]]'', 1933]]\n[[File:Poster - Man of the Forest (1933) 05 (1).jpg|thumb|right|[[Barton MacLane]], [[Tom Kennedy (actor)|Tom Kennedy]], [[Noah Beery, Sr.]], Scott and [[Verna Hillie]] in ''Man of the Forest'', 1933]]\n[[File:Poster - Man of the Forest (1933) 09.jpg|thumb|right|[[Noah Beery, Sr.]] and Scott in ''Man of the Forest'', 1933]]\nScott's first role under his new [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] contract was a small supporting part in a comedy called ''[[Sky Bride]]'' (1932) starring [[Richard Arlen]] and [[Jack Oakie]].\n\nFollowing that, however, Paramount cast him as the lead in ''[[Heritage of the Desert (1932 film)|Heritage of the Desert]]'' (1932), his first significant starring role and also the one that established him as a [[Western (genre)|Western]] hero. As with ''Women Men Marry'', [[Sally Blane]] was his leading lady. [[Henry Hathaway]] made his directorial debut with ''Heritage of the Desert''. The film was popular and Scott would go on to make ten \"B\" [[Western (genre)|Western]] films loosely based on the novels of [[Zane Grey]].\n\n(Around the same time, [[Fox Film Corporation|Fox]] also remade some [[Zane Grey]] titles that they owned, with [[George O'Brien (actor)|George O'Brien]] as their star.)\n\nMany of these Grey adaptations were remakes of earlier silent films. In an effort to save on production costs, Paramount utilized stock footage from the silent version and even hired some of the same actors, such as [[Raymond Hatton]] and [[Noah Beery, Sr.|Noah Beery]], to repeat their roles. For the 1933 films ''[[The Thundering Herd (1933 film)|The Thundering Herd]]'' and ''[[Man of the Forest (1933 film)|Man of the Forest]]'', Scott's hair was darkened and he sported a trim moustache so that he could easily be matched to footage of [[Jack Holt (actor)|Jack Holt]], the star of the silent versions.\n\nIn his book, ''The Hollywood Western: Ninety Years of Cowboys and Indians, Train Robbers, Sheriffs and Gunslingers'', film historian [[William K. Everson]] refers to the Zane Grey series as being \"uniformly good\".<ref name=\"Everson\">Everson, William K. ''The Hollywood Western: Ninety Years of Cowboys and Indians, Train Robbers, Sheriffs and Gunslingers.'' New York. Citadel Press, 1992, First edition 1969.</ref> He also writes:<blockquote>''To the Last Man'' was almost a model of its kind, an exceptionally strong story of feuding families in the post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] era, with a cast worthy of an \"A\" feature, excellent direction by [[Henry Hathaway]], and an unusual climactic fight between the villain (Jack LaRue) and the ''heroine'' ([[Esther Ralston]], in an exceptionally appealing performance).\n\n''Sunset Pass''...&nbsp;was not only one of the best but also one of the most surprising in presenting Randolph Scott and [[Harry Carey (actor born 1878)|Harry Carey]] as ''heavies.''</blockquote>\n\nThe Zane Grey series were a boon for Scott, as they provided him with \"an excellent training ground for both action and acting\".<ref>Nott 2005, p. 9.</ref>\n\nIn between his work in the Zane Grey [[Western (genre)|Western]] series, Paramount cast Scott in several non-[[Western (genre)|Western]] roles, such as \"the other man\" in ''[[Hot Saturday]]'' (1932), with [[Nancy Carroll]] and [[Cary Grant]].\n\nScott returned to Zane Grey Westerns with ''[[Wild Horse Mesa (1932 film)|Wild Horse Mesa]]'' (1932), then was the romantic male lead in ''[[Hello, Everybody!]]'' (1933), an odd one-shot attempt to make a film star out of the popular but heavy-set radio singer [[Kate Smith]].\n\n''[[The Thundering Herd (1933 film)|The Thundering Herd]]'' (1933) was another Zane Grey Western with Hathaway, then he was in two horror movies, ''[[Murders in the Zoo]]'' (1933) with [[Lionel Atwill]] and ''[[Supernatural (film)|Supernatural]]'' (1933) with [[Carole Lombard]].\n\nAfter the Western ''[[Sunset Pass (1933 film)|Sunset Pass]]'' (1933), Paramount loaned Scott to [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]], to play [[Bebe Daniels]]'s love interest in a minor romantic comedy called ''[[Cocktail Hour (film)|Cocktail Hour]]'' (1933).\n\nBack at Paramount Scott did the Westerns ''[[Man of the Forest (1933 film)|Man of the Forest]]'' (1933) and ''[[To the Last Man (1933 film)|To the Last Man]]'' (1933), both with Hathaway from Grey novels. He was loaned to [[Monogram Pictures]] for ''[[Broken Dreams (1933 film)|Broken Dreams]]'' (1933) then was back with Hathaway for ''[[The Last Round-Up (1934 film)|The Last Round-Up]]'' (1934).\n\nScott did three more Zane Grey Westerns without Hathaway: ''[[Wagon Wheels (film)|Wagon Wheels]]'' (1934) directed by [[Charles Barton (director)|Charles Barton]], ''[[Home on the Range (1935 film)|Home on the Range]]'' (1935) from [[Arthur Jacobson]], and ''[[Rocky Mountain Mystery]]'' (1935) with Barton.\n\n===RKO and \"A\" Films===\nParamount loaned Scott to [[RKO Pictures|RKO Radio Pictures]] to support [[Fred Astaire]], [[Ginger Rogers]] and [[Irene Dunne]] in ''[[Roberta (1935 film)|Roberta]]'' (1935), a hugely popular adaptation of the Broadway musical.\n\nRKO liked Scott and kept him on for ''[[Village Tale]]'' (1935), directed by John Cromwell, and ''[[She (1935 film)|She]]'' (1935), an adaptation of [[She (novel)|the classic novel]] by [[H. Rider Haggard]] from the makers of ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]''.\n\nScott went back to Paramount for ''[[So Red the Rose (film)|So Red the Rose]]'' (1935) with [[Margaret Sullavan]], then was reunited with Astaire and Rogers at RKO in ''[[Follow the Fleet]]'' (1936).<ref>Nott 2004, p. 43.</ref> It was another big hit.<ref name=\"rko\">Richard Jewel, 'RKO Film Grosses: 1931-1951', ''Historical Journal of Film Radio and Television'', Vol 14 No 1, 1994 p55</ref>\n\nScott was in a car drama at Paramount, ''[[And Sudden Death]]'' (1936), directed by Barton, then was loaned to independent producer [[Edward Small]], to play [[Natty Bumppo|Hawkeye]] in another adventure classic, ''[[The Last of the Mohicans (1936 film)|The Last of the Mohicans]]'', adapted from the 1826 [[The Last of the Mohicans|novel]] by [[James Fenimore Cooper]]. A big hit in its day, the film \"gave Scott his first unqualified 'A' picture success as a lead.\"<ref>Nott 2004, p. 58.</ref>\n\nParamount now only put Scott in \"A\" films. He was a love interest for [[Mae West]] in ''[[Go West, Young Man]]'' (1936) and was reunited with Irene Dunne in a musical, ''[[High, Wide, and Handsome]]'' (1937). This last film, a musical directed by [[Rouben Mamoulian]], featured Scott in his \"most ambitious performance,\"<ref>Nott 2004, p. 59.</ref> The film is&nbsp;...\n<blockquote>...&nbsp;set in 1859 in [[Pennsylvania]], and follows the exploits of oil prospector Scott as he struggles against various varmints and vested interests out to wreck his business, and tries to keep his marriage to [[Irene Dunne]] intact, despite the tempting presence of saloon singer [[Dorothy Lamour]].<ref name=\"BFI\"/></blockquote>\n\nScott went to [[20th Century Fox]] to play the romantic male lead in a [[Shirley Temple]] film, ''[[Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1938 film)|Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm]]'' (1938). At Paramount he made a well budgeted Western ''[[The Texans]]'' (1938) with [[Joan Bennett]] then he starred in ''[[The Road to Reno (1938 film)|The Road to Reno]]'' (1938) at Universal.\n\nOne missed opportunity came about around this time. Due to his Southern background, Scott was considered for the role of [[Ashley Wilkes]] in ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', but it was [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]] who eventually got the part.\n\n==20th Century Fox==\nScott's contract with Paramount ended and he signed a deal with Fox. They put him in ''[[Jesse James (1939 film)|Jesse James]]'' (1939), a lavish highly romanticized account of the famous [[Jesse James|outlaw]] ([[Tyrone Power]]) and his brother [[Frank James|Frank]] ([[Henry Fonda]]). Scott was billed fourth as a sympathetic marshal after the James brothers; it was his first film in color.\n\nScott was reunited with Temple in ''[[Susannah of the Mounties (film)|Susannah of the Mounties]]'' (1939), Temple's last profitable film for Fox. The studio gave him the lead in ''[[Frontier Marshal (1939 film)|Frontier Marshal]]'' (1939), playing [[Wyatt Earp]].\n\nScott went to Columbia to star in a medium budget action film, ''[[Coast Guard (film)|Coast Guard]]'' (1939). Back at Fox he was in a war movie, ''[[20,000 Men a Year]]'' (1939).\n\nScott went over to Warner Bros to make ''[[Virginia City (film)|Virginia City]]'' (1940), billed third after [[Errol Flynn]] and [[Miriam Hopkins]], playing Flynn's antagonist, a Confederate officer - but a sympathetic one, and not the actual villain (he was played by [[Humphrey Bogart]]). There were frequent disputes between director [[Michael Curtiz]], actors and producer [[Hal Wallis]] about script changes. But Curtiz recalled that Scott tried to stay out of those arguments: \"Randy Scott is a complete anachronism,\" said Curtiz. \"He's a gentleman. And so far he's the only one I've met in this business...\"<ref name=\"Nott 2004 p. 84\">Nott 2004 p. 84</ref> According to Nott, Curtiz and Scott got along well both personally and creatively, with Scott giving one of the top performances in his career.<ref name=\"Nott 2004 p. 84\"/>\n\nScott went back to RKO to play the \"other man\" role in the [[Irene Dunne]]\u2013[[Cary Grant]] romantic comedy ''[[My Favorite Wife]]'' (1940), a huge hit for RKO. For [[Universal Studios|Universal]], he starred with [[Kay Francis]] in ''[[When the Daltons Rode]]'' (1940).\n\nBack at Fox, Scott returned to [[Zane Grey]] country by co-starring with [[Robert Young (actor)|Robert Young]] in the [[Technicolor]] production ''[[Western Union (film)|Western Union]]'', directed by [[Fritz Lang]]. Scott played a \"good bad man\" in this film and gave one of his finest performances. [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote:\n<blockquote>Randolph Scott, who begins to look and act more and more like [[William S. Hart]], herein shapes one of the truest and most appreciable characters of his career as the party's scout.<ref>''[[The New York Times]],'' February 7, 1941.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1941, Scott also co-starred with a young [[Gene Tierney]] in another western, ''[[Belle Starr (film)|Belle Starr]]''.  After a spy film with [[Elisabeth Bergner]], ''[[Paris Calling]]'' (1941), he was in a hugely popular war film at Fox with John Payne and [[Maureen O'Hara]], ''[[To the Shores of Tripoli]]'' (1942).\n\n==Universal==\nScott's only role as a truly evil villain was in [[Universal Studios|Universal]]'s ''[[The Spoilers (1942 film)|The Spoilers]]'' (1942), an adaptation of [[Rex Beach]]'s 1905 tale of the [[Klondike gold rush|Alaskan gold rush]] also starring [[Marlene Dietrich]] and [[John Wayne]]. \n\nThe [[Marlene Dietrich|Dietrich]]-Scott-[[John Wayne|Wayne]] combination led to [[Universal Studios|Universal]] casting the trio that same year in ''[[Pittsburgh (1942 film)|Pittsburgh]]'', a war-time action-melodrama.  Scott was billed above Wayne in both films but Wayne actually played the heroic [[leading man]] roles and enjoyed more screen time in each movie.\n\n==World War II==\nShortly after the United States entered World War II, Scott attempted to obtain an officer's commission in the [[United States Marines|Marines]], but because of a back injury years earlier, he was rejected.<ref name=\"Thomas\"/> However, he did his part for the war effort by touring in a comedy act with [[Joe DeRita]] (who later became a member of [[the Three Stooges]]) for the Victory Committee showcases, and he also raised food for the government on a ranch that he owned.<ref>Nott 2004, p. 67.</ref>\n\nIn 1942 and 1943, Scott appeared in several war films, notably ''To the Shores of Tripoli'' (1942) at Fox, ''[[Bombardier (film)|Bombardier]]'' (1943) at RKO, the Canadian warship drama ''[[Corvette K-225]]'' (1943) (produced by [[Howard Hawks]]), ''[[Gung Ho! (1943 film)|Gung Ho!]]'' at Universal <ref>{{Citation|title=Bugs Bunny-War Bonds|date=1943|url=https://archive.org/details/GungHo-1943Trailer|accessdate=2017-09-21}}</ref> and ''[[China Sky (film)|China Sky]]'' (1945) at RKO.\n\nHe also made ''[[The Desperadoes]]'' (1943), [[Columbia Pictures]]' first feature in [[Technicolor]]. The film was produced by [[Harry Joe Brown]], with whom Scott would form a business partnership several years later.\n\nScott was one of many Universal stars who made a cameo in ''[[Follow the Boys]]'' (1944). He was in a \"northern\" with [[Gypsy Rose Lee]], ''[[Belle of the Yukon]]'' (1944), and made a [[swashbuckler]] film for producer [[Benedict Bogeaus]] alongside [[Charles Laughton]]: the cheaply made production ''[[Captain Kidd (1945 film)|Captain Kidd]]'' (1945).\n\n==Post-World War II career==\n===Tall in the saddle===\n[[File:Abilene Town 1946 (2).jpg|thumb|With Jack Lambert in ''Abilene Town'', 1946]]\nIn 1946, after playing roles that had him wandering in and out of the saddle for many years, Scott appeared in ''[[Abilene Town]]'', a [[United Artists|UA]]<ref>Gritten  2008, p. 8.</ref> release which cast him in what would become one of his classic images, the fearless lawman cleaning up a lawless town. The film \"cemented Scott's position as a cowboy hero\"<ref>Nott 2005, p. 15.</ref> and from this point on all but two of his starring films would be [[Westerns]]. The Scott Westerns of the late 1940s would each be budgeted around US$1,000,000, equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1000000|1946|r=-5}}}} today. Scott mostly made Westerns for producers [[Nat Holt]] or [[Harry Joe Brown]] or at [[Warner Bros]], although he did make ''[[Albuquerque (film)|Albuquerque]]'' (1948) at Paramount.\n\n===Non-Westerns===\nScott's last non-Westerns were a mystery with [[Peggy Ann Garner]] at Fox, ''[[Home Sweet Homicide]]'' (1947), and a family drama for Bogeaus, ''[[Christmas Eve (1947 film)|Christmas Eve]]'' (1947). He also had a cameo in Warners' ''[[Starlift]]'' (1951).\n\n===Nat Holt===\nScott did two Westerns for Nat Holt at RKO, ''[[Badman's Territory]]'' (1946) and ''[[Trail Street]]'' (1947). He followed it with another pair for Holt at that studio, ''[[Return of the Bad Men]]'' (1948) at RKO and ''[[Canadian Pacific (film)|Canadian Pacific]]'' (1949), then they did ''[[Fighting Man of the Plains]]'' (1950) and ''[[The Cariboo Trail]]'' (1950) at Fox.\n\nScott also made ''[[Rage at Dawn]]'' in 1955 for Nat Holt, which was released by [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] starring Scott and [[Forrest Tucker]], and featuring [[Denver Pyle]], [[Edgar Buchanan]], and [[J. Carrol Naish]]. It purports to tell the true story of the [[Reno Gang|Reno Brothers]], an outlaw gang which terrorized the American Midwest, particularly Southern [[Indiana]], soon after the [[American Civil War]].\n\n===Harry Joe Brown===\nScott renewed his acquaintance with producer [[Harry Joe Brown]] at Columbia with ''[[Gunfighters (film)|Gunfighters]]'' (1947). They began producing many of Scott's Westerns, including several that were shot in the two-color [[Cinecolor]] process. Their collaboration resulted in the film ''[[Coroner Creek]]'' (1948) with Scott as a vengeance-driven cowpoke who \"predates the [[Budd Boetticher]]/[[Burt Kennedy]] heroes by nearly a decade,\"<ref>Nott 2005, p. 29.</ref> and ''[[The Walking Hills]]'' (1949), a modern-day tale of gold hunters directed by [[John Sturges]].\n\nThey followed it with ''[[The Doolins of Oklahoma]]'' (1949), ''[[The Nevadan]]'' (1950), ''[[Santa Fe (film)|Santa Fe]]'' (1951), ''[[Man in the Saddle (1951 film)|Man in the Saddle]]'' (1951), ''[[Hangman's Knot]]'' (1952), ''[[The Stranger Wore a Gun]]'' (1953) (shot in 3-D), ''[[Ten Wanted Men]]'' (1955), and ''[[A Lawless Street]]'' (1955) (with [[Angela Lansbury]].)\n\n===Warner Bros.===\nScott did ''[[Colt .45 (film)|Colt .45]]'' (1950) at [[Warner Bros.]] where his salary was US$100,000 per picture (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|100000|1949|r=-5}}}} today). He stayed at the studio to do ''[[Sugarfoot (film)|Sugarfoot]]'' (1951), ''[[Fort Worth (film)|Fort Worth]]'' (1951), ''[[Carson City (film)|Carson City]]'' (1952), ''[[The Man Behind the Gun]]'' (1953), ''[[Thunder Over the Plains]]'' (1953), ''[[Riding Shotgun (film)|Riding Shotgun]]'' (1954), ''[[Tall Man Riding]]'' (1955) Most of  these were directed by [[Andr\u00e9 de Toth]].\n\nAlso of interest is ''[[Shootout at Medicine Bend]]'' shot in 1955, but released in 1957, which was Scott's last movie in black and white. The movie co-stars [[James Garner]] and [[Angie Dickinson]].<ref>Gritten 2008, p. 1071.</ref>\n\nBy 1956, Scott turned 58, an age where the careers of most leading men would be winding down. Scott, however, was about to enter his finest and most acclaimed period.\n\n===Boetticher and Kennedy films===\n[[File:Nancy Gates and Randolph Scott in Comanche Station.png|thumb|upright=1.3|With Nancy Gates in ''[[Comanche Station]]'', 1960]]\nIn 1955, screenwriter [[Burt Kennedy]] wrote a script entitled ''[[Seven Men from Now]]'' which was scheduled to be filmed by [[John Wayne]]'s [[Batjac Productions]] with Wayne as the film's star and [[Budd Boetticher]] as its director. However, Wayne was already committed to [[John Ford]]'s ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]''. Wayne therefore suggested Scott as his replacement.<ref>Nott 2005, p. 131.</ref> The resulting film, released in 1956, did not make a great impact at the time but is now regarded by many as one of Scott's best, as well as the one that launched Scott and Boetticher into a successful collaboration that totaled seven films.\n\nWhile each film is independent and there are no shared characters or settings, this set of films is often called the Ranown Cycle, for the production company run by Scott and Harry Joe Brown, which was involved in their production.<ref>Wilmington, Michael. [http://articles.latimes.com/1992-11-29/entertainment/ca-2438_1_budd-boetticher \"Tall in the director's chair Budd Boetticher made some of the best-remembered westerns of '50s and '60s; they don't make 'em like that (or him) anymore.\"] ''Los Angeles Times,'' November 29, 1992, p. 4.</ref> Kennedy scripted four of them. In these films&nbsp;...\n<blockquote>Boetticher achieved works of great beauty, formally precise in structure and visually elegant, notably for their use of the distinctive landscape of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|California Sierras]]. As the hero of these \"floating poker games\" (as [[Andrew Sarris]] calls them), Scott tempers their innately pessimistic view with quiet, stoical humour, as he pits his wits against such charming villains as [[Richard Boone]] in ''[[The Tall T]]'' and [[Claude Akins]] in ''[[Comanche Station]].''<ref name=\"BFI\"/></blockquote>\n\nAfter ''[[7th Cavalry (film)|7th Cavalry]]'' (1956), Boetticher, Kennedy and Scott were reunited for their second film, ''[[The Tall T]]'' (1957) which co-starred [[Richard Boone]].\n\nThe third in the series was ''[[Decision at Sundown]]'' (1957), although that script was not written by Kennedy. The unofficial series continued with ''[[Buchanan Rides Alone]]'' (1958).\n\n''[[Westbound (film)|Westbound]]'' (1959) is not considered part of the official cycle although Boetticher directed it. However the last two, both written by Kennedy, definitely were: ''[[Ride Lonesome]]'' (1959) and ''[[Comanche Station]]'' (1960)\n\n===Last film: ''Ride the High Country''===\nIn 1962 Scott made his final film appearance in ''[[Ride the High Country]]'', a film now regarded as a classic. It was directed by [[Sam Peckinpah]] and co-starred [[Joel McCrea]], an actor who had a screen image similar to Scott's and who also from the mid-1940s on devoted his career almost exclusively to [[Westerns]].\n\n<blockquote>Scott and [[Joel McCrea|McCrea's]] farewell Western is characterized by a nostalgic sense of the passing of the Old West; a preoccupation with the emotionality of male bonding and of the experiential 'gap' between the young and the old; and the fearful evocation, in the form of the Hammonds (the villains in the film), of these preoccupations transmuted into brutal and perverse forms.<ref name=\"BFI\"/></blockquote>[[Joel McCrea|McCrea]], like Scott, retired from filmmaking after this picture, although he returned to the screen twice in later years.\n\n==Personal life==\n\n===Marriages===\nScott married twice. In 1936, he became the second husband of heiress [[Marion duPont Scott|Marion duPont]], daughter of William du Pont Sr., and great-granddaughter of \u00c9leuth\u00e8re Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e du Pont de Nemours, the founder of the [[E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company]]. Marion had previously married George Somerville, with Scott serving as best man at the wedding. The Scotts' marriage ended in divorce three years later, in 1939. The union produced no children. Though divorced, she kept his last name nearly five decades, until her death in 1983.<ref>Sargent, Sarah.

The machine pays off according to the pattern of symbols displayed when the reels stop \"spinning\".

Since the player is essentially playing a [[video game]], manufacturers are able to offer more interactive elements such as advanced bonus rounds and more varied video graphics.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe \"slot machine\" term derives from the slots on the machine for inserting and retrieving coins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/slot%20machine|title=Slot Machine - Definition of slot machine by Merriam-Webster|work=merriam-webster.com}}</ref> \"Fruit machine\" comes from the traditional fruit images on the spinning reels such as lemons and cherries.<ref>[[OED]], ''fruit'', n.</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Liberty bell.jpg|thumb|1899 \"Liberty Bell\" machine, manufactured by Charles Fey.]]\n[[File:Liberty Bell slot machine 2012-09-15 16-50-38.jpg|thumb|Plaque marking the location of [[Charles Fey]]'s San Francisco workshop, where he invented the three-reel slot machine. The location is a [[California Historical Landmark]].]]\nSittman and Pitt of [[Brooklyn, New York]], developed a gambling machine in 1891, which was a precursor to the modern slot machine. It contained five drums holding a total of 50 card faces based on [[poker]]. This machine proved extremely popular and soon many [[Bar (establishment)|bars]] in the city had one or more of them. Players would insert a [[Nickel (U.S. coin)|nickel]] and pull a lever, which would spin the drums and the cards they held, the player hoping for a good poker hand. There was no direct payout mechanism, so a [[Glossary of poker terms|pair of kings]] might get the player a free beer, whereas a [[Glossary of poker terms|royal flush]] could pay out cigars or drinks, the prizes wholly dependent on what was on offer at the local establishment. To make the odds better for the house, two cards were typically removed from the [[Deck (cards)|deck]]: the ten of [[Spades (suit)|spades]] and the [[Jack (playing card)|jack of hearts]], which doubles the [[odds]] against winning a royal flush. The drums could also be rearranged to further reduce a player's chance of winning.\n\nDue to the vast number of possible wins with the original poker card game, it proved practically impossible to come up with a way to make a machine capable of making an automatic payout for all possible winning combinations. Somewhere between 1887 and 1895,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slot-machine-resource.com/slot-machine-history.htm |title=History of slot machines }}</ref> [[Charles Fey]] of [[San Francisco, California]], devised a much simpler automatic mechanism<ref>{{cite web|url=http://casinogambling.about.com/od/slots/a/charlesfey.htm |title=Charles Fey article |publisher=Casinogambling.about.com |date=2009-06-22 |accessdate=2009-08-04}}</ref> with three spinning reels containing a total of five symbols: horseshoes, diamonds, spades, hearts, and a [[Liberty Bell]]. The bell gave the machine its name. By replacing ten cards with five symbols and using three reels instead of five drums, the complexity of reading a win was considerably reduced, allowing Fey to devise an effective automatic payout mechanism. Three bells in a row produced the biggest payoff, ten nickels (50\u00a2). ''Liberty Bell'' was a huge success and spawned a thriving mechanical gaming device industry. Even when, after a few years, the use of these gambling devices was banned in his home state, Fey still could not keep up with demand for them elsewhere. The Liberty Bell machine was so popular that it was copied by many slot machine manufacturers. The first of these was a machine, also called the \"Liberty Bell\", produced by the manufacturer Herbert Mills in 1907. By 1908 lots of \"bell\" machines were installed in most cigar stores, saloons, bowling alleys, brothels and barber shops.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/gallery/photo/long-colorful-profitable-history-slot-machines-55000 |title=The Long, Colorful, Profitable History of Slot Machines |publisher=The Indian Observer |accessdate=2016-07-18}}</ref> Early machines, including an 1899 \"Liberty Bell\", are now part of the Nevada State Museum's Fey Collection.<ref>{{cite web|title = CM-5716-P-06 Machine, Slot|url = http://www.nevadaculture.org/museums/new_exhibits/cc-slot_machines/exhibit1/e10007a.html|website = Nevada State Museum|accessdate = 2015-09-18}}</ref>\n\nThe first Liberty Bell machines produced by Mills used the same symbols on the reels as Charles Fey's original. Soon afterwards, another version was produced with patriotic symbols such as a flag and a wreath on the wheels. Later, a similar machine, rechristened the Operator's Bell, was designed, for which an optional gum vending attachment was available. As the gum offered was fruit-flavored, fruit symbols were placed on the reels: lemons, cherries, oranges, and plums. A bell was retained, and a picture of a stick of Bell-Fruit Gum, the origin of the bar symbol, was also present. This set of symbols proved highly popular, so was used by the other companies that began to make their own slot machines: Caille, Watling, Jennings and Pace.<ref>{{cite book |last=Fey |first=Marshall |date=1983 |title=Slot Machines A Pictorial History of the First 100 Years |location= |publisher=[[Liberty Belle Books]] |isbn=0-9623852-7-1 }}</ref>\n\nThe payment of food prizes was a commonly used technique to avoid laws against gambling in a number of states. For this reason, a number of [[gumball machine|gumball]] and other [[vending machine]]s were regarded with mistrust by the courts. The two [[Iowa]] cases of ''State v. Ellis''<ref>200 Iowa 1228, 206 N.W. 105. (Iowa, 1925).</ref> and ''State v. Striggles''<ref>202 Iowa 1318, 210 N.W. 137.

The electromechanical approach of the 1960s allowed ''Money Honey'' to be the first slot machine with a bottomless hopper and automatic payout of up to 500 coins without the help of an attendant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ballytech.com/company-information |title=Bally Technologies, Inc. &#124; Company Information |publisher=Ballytech.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-04}}</ref> The popularity of this machine led to the increasing predominance of [[electronic game]]s, with the side lever soon becoming vestigial.\n\nThe first video slot machine was developed in 1976 in [[Kearny Mesa, California]], by the Las Vegas\u2013based Fortune Coin Co. This slot machine used a modified {{convert|19|in|cm|adj=on}} Sony Trinitron color receiver for the display and logic boards for all slot machine functions. The prototype was mounted in a full-size show-ready slot machine cabinet. The first production units went on trial in the [[Las Vegas Hilton Hotel]]. After some \"cheat-proofing\" modifications, the video slot machine was approved by the Nevada State Gaming Commission and eventually found popularity in the [[Las Vegas Strip]] and downtown casinos. Fortune Coin Co. and their video slot machine technology were purchased by IGT (International Gaming Technology) in 1978.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nThe first American video slot machine to offer a \"second screen\" bonus round was ''Reel \u2019Em In'' developed by [[WMS Industries]] in 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.casinocenter.com/?p=834|title=HALL OF FAME IN SLOT GAMES : Casino Player Magazine - Strictly Slots Magazine - Casino Gambling Tips|work=casinocenter.com}}</ref> This type of machine had appeared in Australia from at least 1994 with the \"Three Bags Full\" game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arcade-history.com/?n=3-bags-full&page=detail&id=5056|title=3 Bags Full|work=arcade-history.com}}</ref> In this type of machine, the display changes to provide a different game where an additional payout may be won or accumulated.\n\n==Operation==\n[[Image:Vegas slots.JPG|left|thumb|A row of \"Wheel of Fortune\" slot machines in a casino in Las Vegas. This specific slot machine is themed to the TV game show ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]''.]]\n\nA person playing a slot machine can insert cash or, in \"[[ticket-in, ticket-out]]\" machines, a paper ticket with a [[barcode]], into a designated slot on the machine. The machine is then activated by means of a lever or button (either physical or on a touchscreen), which activates reels that spin and stop to reveal one or several symbols. Most games have a variety of winning combinations of symbols. If a player matches a combination according to the rules of the game, the slot machine credits the player. Symbols can vary depending on the machine, but often include objects such as fruits, bells, and stylized [[Luck#Numerology|lucky sevens]]. Most slot games have a theme, such as a specific [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]], location, or character. Symbols and other bonus features of the game are typically aligned with the theme. Some themes are licensed from popular [[media franchise]]s, including films, television series (including [[game show]]s such as ''[[Wheel of Fortune (American game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]''), entertainers, and musicians.\n\nMulti-line slot machines have become more popular since the 1990s. These machines have more than one payline, meaning that visible symbols that are not aligned on the main horizontal may be considered for winning combinations. Traditional 3-reel slot machines commonly have three or five paylines while video slot machines may have 9, 15, 25, or as many as 1024 different paylines. Most accept variable numbers of credits to play, with 1 to 15 credits per line being typical. The higher the amount bet, the higher the payout will be if the player wins. \n\nOne of the main differences between video slot machines and reel machines is in the way payouts are calculated. With reel machines, the only way to win the maximum jackpot is to play the maximum number of coins (usually 3, sometimes 4 or even 5 coins per spin). With video machines, the fixed payout values are multiplied by the number of coins per line that is being bet. In other words: on a reel machine, the odds are more favorable if the gambler plays with the maximum number of coins available.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Harris|first1=Tom|title=How Slot Machines Work|url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/slot-machine4.htm|accessdate=10 July 2014|date=2002-02-26}}</ref> However, depending on the structure of the game and its bonus features, some video slots may still include features that improve chances at payouts by making increased wagers.\n\n\"Multi-way\" games eschew fixed paylines in favor of allowing symbols to pay anywhere, as long as there is at least one in at least 3 consecutive reels from left to right. Multi-way games may be configured to allow players to bet by-reel: for example, on a game with a 3x5 pattern (often referred to as a 243-way game), playing one reel allows all three symbols in the first reel to potentially pay, but only the center row pays on the remaining reels (often designated by darkening the unused portions of the reels). Other multi-way games use a 4x5 or 5x5 pattern, where there are up to 5 symbols in each reel, allowing for up to 1,024 and 3,125 ways to win respectively. The Australian manufacturer [[Aristocrat Leisure]] brands games featuring this system as \"Reel Power\", \"Xtra Reel Power\" and \"Super Reel Power\" respectively. A variation involves patterns where symbols pay adjacent to one another. Most of these games have a hexagonal reel formation, and much like multi-way games, any patterns not played are darkened out of use.\n\nDenominations can range from 1 cent (\"penny slots\") all the way up to $100.00 or more per credit. The latter are typically known as \"high limit\" machines, and machines configured to allow for such wagers are often located in dedicated areas (which may have a separate team of attendants to cater to the needs of those who play there). The machine automatically calculates the number of credits the player receives in exchange for the cash inserted. Newer machines often allow players to choose from a selection of denominations on a [[splash screen]] or menu.\n\n==Terminology==\nA '''bonus''' is a special feature of the particular game theme, which is activated when certain symbols appear in a winning combination. Bonuses and the number of bonus features vary depending upon the game. Some bonus rounds are a special session of free spins (the number of which is often based on the winning combination that triggers the bonus), often with a different or modified set of winning combinations as the main game and/or other multipliers or increased frequencies of symbols, or a \"hold and re-spin\" mechanic in which specific symbols (usually marked with values of credits or other prizes) are collected and locked in place over a finite number of spins. In other bonus rounds, the player is presented with several items on a screen from which to choose. As the player chooses items, a number of credits is revealed and awarded. Some bonuses use a mechanical device, such as a spinning wheel, that works in conjunction with the bonus to display the amount won. \n\nA '''candle''' is a light on top of the slot machine. It flashes to alert the operator that change is needed, hand pay is requested or a potential problem with the machine. It can be lit by the player by pressing the \"service\" or \"help\" button.\n\n'''Carousel''' refers to a grouping of slot machines, usually in a circle or oval formation.\n\nA '''coin hopper''' is a container where the coins that are immediately available for payouts are held. The hopper is a mechanical device that rotates coins into the coin tray when a player collects credits/coins (by pressing a \"Cash Out\" button). When a certain preset coin capacity is reached, a coin diverter automatically redirects, or \"drops\", excess coins into a \"drop bucket\" or \"drop box\". (Unused coin hoppers can still be found even on games that exclusively employ Ticket-In, Ticket-Out technology, as a vestige.)\n\nThe '''credit meter''' is a display of the amount of money or number of credits on the machine. On mechanical slot machines, this is usually a [[seven-segment display]], but video slot machines typically use stylized text that suits the game's theme and user interface.\n\nThe '''drop bucket''' or '''drop box''' is a container located in a slot machine's base where excess coins are diverted from the hopper. Typically, a drop bucket is used for low-denomination slot machines and a drop box is used for high-denomination slot machines. A drop box contains a hinged lid with one or more locks whereas a drop bucket does not contain a lid. The contents of drop buckets and drop boxes are collected and [[hard count|counted]] by the casino on a scheduled basis.\n\n'''EGM''' is short for \"Electronic Gaming Machine\".\n\n'''Free spins''' are a common form of bonus, where a series of spins are automatically played at no charge at the player's current wager. Free spins are usually triggered via a scatter of at least three designated symbols (with the number of spins dependent on the number of symbols that land). Some games allow the free spins bonus to \"retrigger\", which adds additional spins on top of those already awarded. There is no theoretical limit to the number of free spins obtainable. Some games may have other features that can also trigger over the course of free spins.\n\nA '''[[hand pay]]''' refers to a payout made by an attendant or at an exchange point (\"cage\"), rather than by the slot machine itself. A hand pay occurs when the amount of the payout exceeds the maximum amount that was preset by the slot machine's operator. Usually, the maximum amount is set at the level where the operator must begin to deduct taxes. A hand pay could also be necessary as a result of a short pay.\n\n'''Hopper fill slip''' is a document used to record the replenishment of the coin in the coin hopper after it becomes depleted as a result of making payouts to players. The slip indicates the amount of coin placed into the hoppers, as well as the signatures of the employees involved in the transaction, the slot machine number and the location and the date.\n\n'''MEAL book''' ('''''M'''''achine '''''e'''''ntry '''''a'''''uthorization '''''l'''''og) is a log of the employee's entries into the machine.\n\n'''Low-level''' or '''slant-top''' slot machines include a stool so the player may sit down. '''Stand-up''' or '''upright''' slot machines are played while standing.\n\n'''Optimal play''' is a payback percentage based on a gambler using the optimal strategy in a skill-based slot machine game.\n\n'''Payline''' is a line that crosses through one symbol on each reel, along which a winning combination is evaluated. Classic spinning reel machines usually have up to nine paylines, while video slot machines may have as many as one hundred. Paylines could be of various shapes (horizontal, vertical, oblique, triangular, zigzag, etc.)\n\n'''Persistent state''' refers to passive features on some slot machines, some of which able to trigger bonus payouts or other special features if certain conditions are met over time by players on that machine.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.casinojournal.com/articles/93279-slot-machine-trends-featured-at-g2e?v=preview|title=Slot machine trends featured at G2E|last=|first=|date=|website=Casino Journal|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref>\n\n'''Roll-up''' is the process of dramatizing a win by playing sounds while the '''meters''' count up to the amount that has been won.\n\n'''Short pay''' refers to a partial payout made by a slot machine, which is less than the amount due to the player. This occurs if the coin hopper has been depleted as a result of making earlier payouts to players. The remaining amount due to the player is either paid as a hand pay or an attendant will come and refill the machine.\n\nA '''scatter''' is a pay combination based on occurrences of a designated symbol landing anywhere on the reels, rather than falling in sequence on the same payline. A scatter pay usually requires a minimum of three symbols to land, and the machine may offer increased prizes or jackpots depending on the number that land. Scatters are frequently used to trigger bonus games, such as free spins (with the number of spins multiplying based on the number of scatter symbols that land). The scatter symbol usually cannot be matched using wilds, and some games may require the scatter symbols to appear on consecutive reels in order to pay. On some multiway games, scatter symbols still pay in unused areas.\n\n'''Taste''' is a reference to the small amount often paid out to keep a player seated and continuously betting. Only rarely will machines fail to pay even the minimum out over the course of several pulls.\n\n[[Image:Slot machine Tilt error.jpg|right|thumb|Display screen of a slot machine in tilt mode]]\n'''Tilt''' is a term derived from electromechanical slot machines' \"[[mercury switch|tilt switches]]\", which would make or break a circuit when they were tilted or otherwise tampered with that triggered an alarm. While modern machines no longer have tilt switches, any kind of technical fault (door switch in the wrong state, reel motor failure, out of paper, etc.) is still called a \"tilt\".\n\nA '''theoretical hold worksheet''' is a document provided by the manufacturer for every slot machine that indicates the theoretical percentage the machine should hold based on the amount paid in. The worksheet also indicates the reel strip settings, number of coins that may be played, the payout schedule, the number of reels and other information descriptive of the particular type of slot machine.\n\n'''Volatility''' or '''variance''' refers to the measure of risk associated with playing a slot machine. A low-volatility slot machine has regular but smaller wins, while a high-variance slot machine has fewer but bigger wins.\n\n'''Weight count''' is an American term referring to the total value of coins or tokens removed from a slot machine's drop bucket or drop box for counting by the casino's [[hard count]] team through the use of a weigh scale.\n\n'''Wild symbols''' substitute for most other symbols in the game (similarly to a [[Joker (playing card)|joker]] card), usually excluding scatter and jackpot symbols (or offering a lower prize on non-natural combinations that include wilds). How jokers behave are dependent on the specific game and whether the player is in a bonus or free games mode. Sometimes wild symbols may only appear on certain reels, or have a chance to \"stack\" across the entire reel.\n\n==Pay table==\n{{Main|Pay table}}\nEach machine has a table that lists the number of credits the player will receive if the symbols listed on the pay table line up on the pay line of the machine. Some symbols are wild and can represent many, or all, of the other symbols to complete a winning line. Especially on older machines, the pay table is listed on the face of the machine, usually above and below the area containing the wheels. On video slot machines, they are usually contained within a help menu, along with information on other features.\n\n==Technology==\n===Reels===\nHistorically, all slot machines used revolving mechanical reels to display and determine results. Although the original slot machine used five reels, simpler, and therefore more reliable, three reel machines quickly became the standard.\n\nA problem with three reel machines is that the number of combinations is only [[cube (algebra)|cubic]] &ndash; the original slot machine with three physical reels and 10 symbols on each reel had only 10<sup>3</sup> = 1,000 possible combinations. This limited the manufacturer's ability to offer large jackpots since even the rarest event had a likelihood of 0.1%. The maximum theoretical payout, assuming 100% return to player would be 1000 times the bet, but that would leave no room for other pays, making the machine very high risk, and also quite boring.\n\nAlthough the number of symbols eventually increased to about 22, allowing 10,648 combinations,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gaming.unlv.edu/reading/Pacyniak.PDF |title=Info |website=gaming.unlv.edu }}</ref> this still limited jackpot sizes as well as the number of possible outcomes.\n\nIn the 1980s, however, slot machine manufacturers incorporated electronics into their products and programmed them to weight particular symbols. Thus the odds of losing symbols appearing on the payline became disproportionate to their actual frequency on the physical reel. A symbol would only appear once on the reel displayed to the player, but could, in fact, occupy several stops on the multiple reel.\n\nIn 1984 Inge Telnaes received a patent for a device titled, \"Electronic Gaming Device Utilizing a Random Number Generator for Selecting the Reel Stop Positions\" (US Patent 4448419),<ref>{{US patent|4448419|Electronic gaming device utilizing a random number generator for selecting the reel stop positions}}</ref> which states: \"It is important to make a machine that is perceived to present greater chances of payoff than it actually has within the legal limitations that games of chance must operate.\" <ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last=Collier |first=Roger\n |date=1 July 2008\n |title=Do slot machines play mind games with gamblers?\n |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal\n |volume=179 |issue=1 |pages=23\u20134\n |doi=10.1503/cmaj.080870\n |pmc=2464464\n |pmid=18591518\n}}</ref> The patent was later bought by [[International Game Technology (1975)|International Game Technology]] and has since expired.\n\nA virtual reel that has 256 virtual stops per reel would allow up to 256<sup>3</sup> = 16,777,216 final positions. The manufacturer could choose to offer a $1 million dollar jackpot on a $1 bet, confident that it will only happen, over the long term, once every 16.8 million plays.\n\n===Computerization===\nWith [[microprocessor]]s now ubiquitous, the computers inside modern slot machines allow manufacturers to assign a different probability to every symbol on every reel. To the player it might appear that a winning symbol was \"so close\", whereas in fact the probability is much lower.\n\nIn the 1980s in the U.K., machines embodying microprocessors became common. These used a number of features to ensure the payout was controlled within the limits of the gambling legislation. As a coin was inserted into the machine, it could go either directly into the cashbox for the benefit of the owner or into a channel that formed the payout reservoir, with the microprocessor monitoring the number of coins in this channel. The drums themselves were driven by stepper motors, controlled by the processor and with proximity sensors monitoring the position of the drums. A \"look-up table\" within the software allows the processor to know what symbols were being displayed on the drums to the gambler. This allowed the system to control the level of payout by stopping the drums at positions it had determined. If the payout channel had filled up, the payout became more generous; if nearly empty, the payout became less so (thus giving good control of the odds).\n\n===Video slot machines===\nVideo slot machines do not use mechanical reels, instead using graphical reels on a computerized [[Display device|display]]. As there are no mechanical constraints on the design of video slot machines, games often use at least five reels, and may also use non-standard layouts. This greatly expands the number of possibilities: a machine can have 50 or more symbols on a reel, giving [[odds]] as high as 300 million to 1 against &ndash; enough for even the largest jackpot. As there are so many combinations possible with five reels, manufacturers do not need to weight the payout symbols (although some may still do so). Instead, higher-paying symbols will typically appear only once or twice on each reel, while more common symbols earning a more frequent payout will appear many times. Video slot machines usually make more extensive use of [[multimedia]], and can feature more elaborate [[minigame]]s as bonuses. Modern cabinets typically use [[flat-panel display]]s, but cabinets using larger [[Curved screen|curved screens]] (which can provide a more immersive experience for the player) are not uncommon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/6/8544303/casino-slot-machine-gambling-addiction-psychology-mobile-games|title=Slot machines perfected addictive gaming. Now, tech wants their tricks|last=Thompson|first=Andrew|date=2015-05-06|website=The Verge|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-30}}</ref>\n\nVideo slot machines typically encourage the player to play multiple \"lines\": rather than simply taking the middle of the three symbols displayed on each reel, a line could go from top left to bottom right or any other pattern specified by the manufacturer. As each symbol is equally likely, there is no difficulty for the manufacturer in allowing the player to take as many of the possible lines on offer as desire &ndash; the long-term return to the player will be the same. The difference for the player is that, the more lines they play, the more likely they are to get paid on a given spin (because they are betting more).\n\nTo avoid seeming as if the player's money is simply ebbing away (whereas a payout of 100 credits on a single-line machine would be 100 bets and the player would feel they had made a substantial win, on a 20-line machine, it would only be 5 bets and not seem as significant), manufacturers commonly offer bonus games, which can return many times their bet. The player is encouraged to keep playing to reach the bonus: even if he is losing, the bonus game could allow then to win back their losses.\n===Random number generators===\nAll modern machines are designed using [[pseudo random number generator|pseudorandom number generator]]s (\"PRNGs\"), which are constantly generating a sequence of simulated random numbers, at a rate of hundreds or perhaps thousands per second. As soon as the \"Play\" button is pressed, the most recent random number is used to determine the result. This means that the result varies depending on exactly when the game is played. A fraction of a second earlier or later and the result would be different.\n\nIt is important that the machine contains a high-quality RNG implementation. Because all PRNGs must eventually repeat their number sequence<ref>{{cite book|title=Art of Computer Programming|volume=II. Seminumerical Algorithms|edition=1st|chapter=3. Random numbers|last=Knuth|first=Donald E.|authorlink=Donald Knuth|date=|pp=3\u20134|title-link=Art of Computer Programming}}</ref> and, if the period is short or the PRNG is otherwise flawed, an advanced player may be able to \"predict\" the next result. Having access to the PRNG code and seed values, [[Ronald Dale Harris]], a former slot machine programmer, discovered equations for specific gambling games like [[Keno]] that allowed him to predict what the next set of selected numbers would be based on the previous games played.\n\nMost machines are designed to defeat this by generating numbers even when the machine is not being played so the player cannot tell where in the sequence they are, even if they know how the machine was programmed.\n\n===Payout percentage===\n{{Globalize|section|date=April 2019}}\nSlot machines are typically programmed to pay out as winnings 82% to 98% of the money that is wagered by players. This is known as the \"theoretical payout percentage\" or RTP, \"return to player\". The minimum theoretical payout percentage varies among jurisdictions and is typically established by law or regulation. For example, the minimum payout in [[Nevada]] is 75%, in [[New Jersey]] 83%, and in Mississippi 80%. The winning patterns on slot machines &ndash; the amounts they pay and the frequencies of those payouts &ndash; are carefully selected to yield a certain fraction of the money payed to the \"house\" (the operator of the slot machine) while returning the rest to the players during play. Suppose that a certain slot machine costs $1 per spin and has a return to player (RTP) of 95%. It can be calculated that, over a sufficiently long period such as 1,000,000 spins, the machine will return an average of $950,000 to its players, who have inserted $1,000,000 during that time. In this (simplified) example, the slot machine is said to pay out 95%. The operator keeps the remaining $50,000. Within some EGM development organizations this concept is referred to simply as \"par\". \"Par\" also manifests itself to gamblers as promotional techniques: \"Our 'Loose Slots' have a 93% payback! Play now!\"{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nA slot machine's theoretical payout percentage is set at the factory when the [[software]] is written. Changing the payout percentage after a slot machine has been placed on the gaming floor requires a physical swap of the software or ''[[firmware]]'', which is usually stored on an [[EPROM]] but may be loaded onto non-volatile random access memory ([[NVRAM]]) or even stored on [[CD-ROM]] or [[DVD]], depending on the capabilities of the machine and the applicable regulations. {{citation needed span|date=April 2019|text=Based on current technology, this is a time-consuming process and as such is done infrequently.}} In certain jurisdictions, such as New Jersey, the EPROM has a [[tamper-evident]] [[security seal|seal]] and can only be changed in the presence of [[Gaming Control Board]] officials. Other jurisdictions, including Nevada, randomly [[audit]] slot machines to ensure that they contain only approved software.\n\nHistorically, many casinos, both online and offline, have been unwilling to publish individual game RTP figures, making it impossible for the player to know whether they are playing a \"loose\" or a \"tight\" game. Since the turn of the century some information regarding these figures has started to come into the public domain either through various casinos releasing them\u2014primarily this applies to online casinos\u2014or through studies by independent gambling authorities.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe ''return to player'' is not the only statistic that is of interest. The probabilities of every payout on the pay table is also critical. For example, consider a hypothetical slot machine with a dozen different values on the pay table. However, the probabilities of getting all the payouts are zero except the largest one. If the payout is 4,000 times the input amount, and it happens every 4,000 times on average, the ''return to player'' is exactly 100%, but the game would be dull to play. Also, most people would not win anything, and having entries on the paytable that have a return of zero would be deceptive. As these individual probabilities are closely guarded secrets, it is possible that the advertised machines with high return to player simply increase the probabilities of these jackpots. The casino could legally place machines of a similar style payout and advertise that some machines have 100% return to player. The added advantage is that these large jackpots increase the excitement of the other players.\n\nThe table of probabilities for a specific machine is called the Probability and Accounting Report or PAR sheet, also PARS commonly understood as Paytable and Reel Strips. Mathematician [[Michael Shackleford]] revealed the PARS for one commercial slot machine, an original [[International Gaming Technology]] ''Red White and Blue'' machine. This game, in its original form, is obsolete, so these specific probabilities do not apply. He only published the odds after a fan of his sent him some information provided on a slot machine that was posted on a machine in the Netherlands. The psychology of the machine design is quickly revealed. There are 13 possible payouts ranging from 1:1 to 2,400:1. The 1:1 payout comes every 8 plays. The 5:1 payout comes every 33 plays, whereas the 2:1 payout comes every 600 plays. Most players assume the likelihood increases proportionate to the payout. The one mid-size payout that is designed to give the player a thrill is the 80:1 payout. It is programmed to occur an average of once every 219 plays. The 80:1 payout is high enough to create excitement, but not high enough that it makes it likely that the player will take his winnings and abandon the game. More than likely the player began the game with at least 80 times his bet (for instance there are 80 quarters in $20). In contrast the 150:1 payout occurs only on average of once every 6,241 plays. The highest payout of 2,400:1 occurs only on average of once every 64<sup>3</sup> = 262,144 plays since the machine has 64 virtual stops. The player who continues to feed the machine is likely to have several mid-size payouts, but unlikely to have a large payout. He quits after he is bored or has exhausted his bankroll.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n\nDespite their confidentiality, occasionally a PAR sheet is posted on a website. They have limited value to the player, because usually a machine will have 8 to 12 different possible programs with varying payouts. In addition, slight variations of each machine (e.g., with ''double jackpots'' or ''five times play'') are always being developed. The casino operator can choose which EPROM chip to install in any particular machine to select the payout desired. The result is that there is not really such a thing as a high payback type of machine, since every machine potentially has multiple settings. From October 2001 to February 2002, columnist Michael Shackleford obtained PAR sheets for five different nickel machines; four IGT games ''[[Austin Powers (disambiguation)|Austin Powers]]'', ''Fortune Cookie'', ''Leopard Spots'' and ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' and one game manufactured by WMS; ''Reel 'em In''. Without revealing the proprietary information, he developed a program that would allow him to determine with usually less than a dozen plays on each machine which EPROM chip was installed. Then he did a survey of over 400 machines in 70 different casinos in Las Vegas. He averaged the data, and assigned an average payback percentage to the machines in each casino. The resultant list was widely publicized for marketing purposes (especially by the Palms casino which had the top ranking).{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n\nOne reason that the slot machine is so profitable to a casino is that the player must play the ''high house edge and high payout'' wagers along with the ''low house edge and low payout'' wagers. In a more traditional wagering game like craps, the player knows that certain wagers have almost a 50/50 chance of winning or losing, but they only pay a limited multiple of the original bet (usually no higher than three times). Other bets have a higher house edge, but the player is rewarded with a bigger win (up to thirty times in craps). The player can choose what kind of wager he wants to make. A slot machine does not afford such an opportunity. Theoretically, the operator could make these probabilities available, or allow the player to choose which one so that the player is free to make a choice. However, no operator has ever enacted this strategy. Different machines have different maximum payouts, but without knowing the odds of getting the jackpot, there is no rational way to differentiate.\n\nIn many markets where central monitoring and control systems are used to link machines for auditing and security purposes, usually in wide area networks of multiple venues and thousands of machines, player return must usually be changed from a central computer rather than at each machine. A range of percentages is set in the game software and selected remotely.\n\nIn 2006, the Nevada Gaming Commission began working with Las Vegas casinos on technology that would allow the casino's management to change the game, the odds, and the payouts remotely. The change cannot be done instantaneously, but only after the selected machine has been idle for at least four minutes. After the change is made, the machine must be locked to new players for four minutes and display an on-screen message informing potential players that a change is being made.<ref>{{cite news|last=Richtel |first=Matt |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/12/technology/12casino.html?ei=5089&en=9e945a28ba5016c6&ex=1302494400&partner=rssyahoo&emc=rss&pagewanted=all |title=From the Back Office, a Casino Can Change the Slot Machine in Seconds|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=12 April 2009|accessdate=10 December 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Linked machines===\nSome varieties of slot machines can be linked together in a setup sometimes known as a \"community\" game.

In these cases, the machines may be owned by the manufacturer, who is responsible for paying the jackpot. The casinos [[lease]] the machines rather than owning them outright.

One historical example involved spinning a coin with a short length of plastic wire. The weight and size of the coin would be accepted by the machine and credits would be granted. However, the spin created by the plastic wire would cause the coin to exit through the reject chute into the payout tray. This particular scam has become obsolete due to improvements in newer slot machines. Another obsolete method of defeating slot machines was to use a light source to confuse the optical sensor used to count coins during payout.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/news/2003-08-11-slot-cheats_x.htm |title=Slot machine cheat bilked casinos with ingenious gadgets |newspaper=USAToday.com |accessdate=2014-06-08}}</ref>\n\nModern slot machines are controlled by EPROM computer chips and, in large casinos, coin acceptors have become obsolete in favor of bill acceptors. These machines and their bill acceptors are designed with advanced anti-cheating and anti-counterfeiting measures and are difficult to defraud. Early computerized slot machines were sometimes defrauded through the use of cheating devices, such as the \"slider\" or \"monkey paw\".

Many states have established [[gaming control board]]s to regulate the possession and use of slot machines and other form of gaming.\n\n[[Nevada]] is the only state that has no significant restrictions against slot machines both for public and private use. In [[New Jersey]], slot machines are only allowed in hotel casinos operated in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]]. Several states ([[Indiana]], [[Louisiana]] and [[Missouri]]) allow slot machines (as well as any casino-style gambling) only on licensed [[riverboat]]s or permanently anchored [[barge]]s. Since [[Hurricane Katrina]], [[Mississippi]] has removed the requirement that casinos on the Gulf Coast operate on barges and now allows them on land along the shoreline. [[Delaware]] allows slot machines at three horse tracks; they are regulated by the [[Delaware Lottery|state lottery]] commission. In Wisconsin, bars and taverns are allowed to have up to five machines. These machines usually allow a player to either take a payout, or gamble it on a double-or-nothing \"side game\". \n\nThe [[Unincorporated territories of the United States|territory]] of [[Puerto Rico]] places significant restrictions on slot machine ownership, but the law is widely flouted and slot machines are common in bars and coffeeshops.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/765596778/Illegal-slot-machines-threaten-Puerto-Rico-casinos.html?pg=all|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|last=Coto|first=Danica|date=August 13, 2012|title=Illegal slot machines threaten Puerto Rico casinos|accessdate=June 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn regards to [[Native American gaming|tribal casinos]] located on [[Indian reservation|Native American reservations]], slot machines played against the house and operating independently from a [[centralized system|centralized computer system]] are classified as \"Class III\" gaming by the [[Indian Gaming Regulatory Act]] (IGRA), and sometimes promoted as \"Vegas-style\" slot machines.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://southfloridareporter.com/10-casinos-you-can-gamble-at-in-south-florida/|title=10 Casinos You Can Gamble at in South Florida|last=SouthFloridaReporter.com|date=2018-09-05|website=South Florida Reporter|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-10}}</ref> In order to offer Class III gaming, tribes must enter into a [[Tribal-state compacts|compact]] (agreement) with the state that is approved by the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]], which may contain restrictions on the types and quantity of such games.

In essence, the term \"lottery scheme\" used in the code means slot machines, bingo and table games normally associated with a casino.

In Australia, gaming machines are a matter for state governments, so laws vary between states.\n\nGaming machines are found in casinos (approximately one in each major city), [[pub]]s and clubs in some states (usually sports, social, or [[Returned and Services League of Australia|RSL]] clubs). The first Australian state to legalize this style of gambling was [[New South Wales]], when in 1956 they were made legal in all registered clubs in the state. There are suggestions that the proliferation of poker machines has led to increased levels of [[problem gambling]]; however, the precise nature of this link is still open to research.<ref>[http://www.pc.gov.au/inquiry/gambling/finalreport/index.html PC.gov.au] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819030433/http://www.pc.gov.au/inquiry/gambling/finalreport/index.html |date=2006-08-19 }}, see Chapter 8, Productivity Commission Report no. 10</ref>\n\nIn 1999 the Australian Productivity Commission reported that nearly half Australia's gaming machines were in New South Wales. At the time, 21% of all the gambling machines in the world were operating in Australia and, on a per capita basis, Australia had roughly five times as many gaming machines as the United States. Australia ranks 8th in total number of gaming machines after Japan, U.S.A., Italy, U.K., Spain and Germany. This primarily is because gaming machines have been legal in the state of New South Wales since 1956; over time, the number of machines has grown to 97,103 (at December 2010, including the Australian Capital Territory). By way of comparison, the U.S. State of Nevada, which legalised gaming including slots several decades before N.S.W., had 190,135 slots operating.<ref>{{cite news|title=One pokie for every 110 of us|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/one-pokie-for-every-110-of-us-20100116-mdf3.html|accessdate=28 November 2015|agency=SMH|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=17 January 2010}}</ref>\n\nRevenue from gaming machines in pubs and clubs accounts for more than half of the $4 billion in gambling revenue collected by state governments in fiscal year 2002&ndash;03.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn [[Queensland]], gaming machines in pubs and clubs must provide a return rate of 85%, while machines located in casinos must provide a return rate of 90%.{{cn|date=August 2019}} Most other states have similar provisions. In [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]], gaming machines must provide a minimum return rate of 87% (including jackpot contribution), including machines in [[Crown Melbourne|Crown Casino]]. As of December 1, 2007, Victoria banned gaming machines that accepted $100 notes; all gaming machines made since 2003 comply with this rule. This new law also banned machines with an automatic play option. One exception exists in Crown Casino for any player with a VIP loyalty card: they can still insert $100 notes and use an autoplay feature (whereby the machine will automatically play until credit is exhausted or the player intervenes). All gaming machines in Victoria have an information screen accessible to the user by pressing the \"i key\" button, showing the game rules, paytable, return to player percentage, and the top and bottom five combinations with their odds. These combinations are stated to be played on a minimum bet (usually 1 credit per line, with 1 line or reel played, although some newer machines do not have an option to play 1 line; some machines may only allow maximum lines to be played), excluding feature wins.\n\n[[Western Australia]] only permits certain forms of gaming machine in [[Burswood Entertainment Complex|Burswood casino]] and no gaming machines elsewhere. This policy (the most restrictive in Australia) had an extensive political history, reaffirmed by the 1974 Royal Commission into Gambling:<ref>Western Australia, Report of the Royal Commission into Gambling (1974), pp.\u200772\u201373.</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=Poker machine playing is a mindless, repetitive and insidious form of gambling which has many undesirable features. It requires no thought, no skill or social contact. The odds are never about winning.

Historically poker machines have been banned from Western Australia and we consider that, in the public interest, they should stay banned.|sign=|source=}}\n\nWhile Western Australian gaming machines are similar to the other states', they do not have spinning reels. Therefore different animations are used in place of the spinning reels in order to display each game result.\n\n[[Nick Xenophon]] was elected on an independent [[No Pokies]] ticket in the [[South Australian Legislative Council]] at the [[1997 South Australian state election]] on 2.9 percent, re-elected at the [[2006 South Australian state election|2006 election]] on 20.5 percent, and elected to the [[Australian Senate]] at the [[2007 Australian federal election|2007 federal election]] on 14.8 percent. Independent candidate [[Andrew Wilkie]], an anti-pokies campaigner, was elected to the [[Australian House of Representatives]] seat of [[Division of Denison|Denison]] at the [[2010 Australian federal election|2010 federal election]]. Wilkie was one of four crossbenchers who supported the [[Julia Gillard|Gillard]] [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government following the [[hung parliament]] result. Wilkie immediately began forging ties with Xenophon as soon as it was apparent that he was elected. In exchange for Wilkie's support, the Labor government are attempting to implement [[precommitment]] technology for high-bet/high-intensity poker machines, against opposition from the [[Tony Abbott]] [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] and Clubs Australia.\n\n=== Russia ===\nIn Russia, \"slot clubs\" appeared quite late, only in 1992. Before 1992, slot machines were only in casinos and small shops, but later slot clubs began appearing all over the country. The most popular and numerous were \"Vulcan 777\" and \"Taj Mahal\". Since 2009 when gambling establishments were banned, almost all slot clubs disappeared and are found only in a specially authorized gambling zones.\n\n===United Kingdom=== <!-- [[Fixed odds betting terminal]] links here. -->\n[[Image:Old fruit machines in Teignmouth 10-08-06.jpg|thumb|right|Row of old fruit machines in Teignmouth Pier, Devon]]\n[[Image:Slot machines at Wookey Hole Caves.JPG|thumb|right|One armed bandits at [[Wookey Hole Caves]]]]\nSlot machines are covered by the [[Gambling Act 2005]], which superseded the [[Gaming Act 1968]].<ref name=GamingAct>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2005/20052776.htm|title=Gaming Act 2005|year=2005|publisher=[[The Stationery Office]]|accessdate=2 November 2009}}</ref>\n\nSlot machines in the U.K. are categorised by definitions produced by the [[Gambling Commission]] as part of the Gambling Act of 2005.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

As defined by the 2005 Act, large casinos can have a maximum of one hundred and fifty machines in any combination of categories B\u2013D (subject to a machine-to-table ratio of 5:1); small casinos can have a maximum of eighty machines in any combination of categories B\u2013D (subject to a machine-to-table ratio of 2:1).\n\n====Category A====\nCategory A games were defined in preparation for the planned \"[[Regional casino|Super Casinos]]\". Despite a lengthy bidding process with [[Manchester]] being chosen as the single planned location, the development was cancelled soon after [[Gordon Brown]] became [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]. As a result, there are no lawful Category A games in the U.K.\n\n====Category B====\nCategory B games are divided into subcategories. The differences between B1, B3 and B4 games are mainly the stake and prizes as defined in the above table. Category B2 games &ndash; [[Fixed odds betting terminal]]s (FOBTs) &ndash; have quite different stake and prize rules: FOBTs are mainly found in licensed [[betting shop]]s, or bookmakers, usually in the form of electronic [[roulette]].\n\nThe games are based on a [[random number generation|random number generator]]; thus each game's probability of getting the jackpot is independent of any other game: probabilities are all equal. If a [[pseudorandom number generator]] is used instead of a truly random one, probabilities are not independent since each number is determined at least in part by the one generated before it.\n\n====Category C====\nCategory C games are often referred to as '''fruit machines''', '''one-armed bandits''' and '''AWP''' ([[amusement with prize]]). Fruit machines are commonly found in [[public house|pubs]], [[Nightclub|club]]s, and [[video arcade|arcade]]s. Machines commonly have three but can be found with four or five reels, each with 16\u201324 symbols printed around them. The reels are spun each play, from which the appearance of particular combinations of symbols result in payment of their associated winnings by the machine (or alternatively initiation of a subgame). These games often have many extra features, trails and subgames with opportunities to win money; usually more than can be won from just the payouts on the reel combinations.\n\nFruit machines in the U.K. almost universally have the following features, generally selected at random using a [[pseudorandom number generator]]:\n* A player (known in the industry as a ''punter'') may be given the opportunity to ''hold'' one or more reels before spinning, meaning they will not be spun but instead retain their displayed symbols yet otherwise count normally for that play. This can sometimes increase the chance of winning, especially if two or more reels are held.\n* A player may also be given a number of ''nudges'' following a spin (or, in some machines, as a result in a subgame). A nudge is a step rotation of a reel chosen by the player (the machine may not allow all reels to be nudged for a particular play).\n* ''Cheats'' can also be made available on the Internet or through emailed newsletters to subscribers. These cheats give the player the impression of an advantage, whereas in reality the payout percentage remains exactly the same. The most widely used cheat is known as '''hold after a nudge''' and increases the chance that the player will win following an unsuccessful nudge. The cheats give the player an incentive to play the latest games.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} In reality, whilst machines from the early 1990s did not advertise the concept of '''hold after a nudge''' when this feature was first introduced, it became so well-known amongst players and widespread amongst new machine releases that it is now well-advertised on the machine during play. This is characterized by messages on the display such as ''DON'T HOLD ANY'' or ''LET 'EM SPIN'' and is a designed feature of the machine, not a cheat at all.\n\nIt is known for machines to pay out multiple jackpots, one after the other (this is known as a '''streak''' or '''rave''') but each jackpot requires a new game to be played so as not to violate the law about the maximum payout on a single play. Typically this involves the player only pressing the Start button for which a single credit is taken, regardless of whether this causes the reels to spin or not. The minimum payout percentage is 70%, with pubs often setting the payout at around 78%.\n\n===Japan===\n{{See|Pachinko}}\n\n[[Japan]]ese slot machines, known as {{nihongo|'''pachisuro'''|[[:ja:\u30d1\u30c1\u30b9\u30ed|\u30d1\u30c1\u30b9\u30ed]]}} or '''pachislot''' ([[portmanteau]]s of the words \"pachinko\" and \"slot machine\"), are a descendant of the traditional Japanese [[pachinko]] game. Slot machines are a fairly new phenomenon and they can be found mostly in pachinko parlors and the adult sections of [[Video arcade|amusement arcade]]s, known as game centers.\n\nThe machines are regulated with [[integrated circuit]]s, and have six different levels changing the odds of a [[777 (number)#Gambling and luck|777]]. The levels provide a rough outcome of between 90% to 160% (200% for skilled players). Japanese slot machines are \"beatable\". Parlor operators naturally set most machines to simply collect money, but intentionally place a few paying machines on the floor so that there will be at least someone winning,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} encouraging players on the losing machines to keep gambling, using the psychology of the [[gambler's fallacy]].\n\nDespite the many varieties of pachislot machines, there are certain rules and regulations put forward by the {{nihongo|Security Electronics and Communication Technology Association|[[:ja:\u4fdd\u5b89\u96fb\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u6280\u8853\u5354\u4f1a|\u4fdd\u5b89\u96fb\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u6280\u8853\u5354\u4f1a]]}}, an affiliate of the [[National Police Agency (Japan)|National Police Agency]]. For example, there must be three reels. All reels must be accompanied by buttons which allow players to manually stop them, reels may not spin faster than 80 RPM, and reels must stop within 0.19 seconds of a button press. In practice, this means that machines cannot let reels slip more than 4 symbols. Other rules include a 15 coin payout cap, a 50 credit cap on machines, a 3 coin maximum bet, and other such regulations.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nAlthough a 15 coin payout may seem quite low, regulations allow \"Big Bonus\" (c. 400\u2013711 coins) and \"Regular Bonus\" modes (c. 110 coins) where these 15 coin payouts occur nearly continuously until the bonus mode is finished. While the machine is in bonus mode,  the player is entertained with special winning scenes on the LCD display, and energizing music is heard, payout after payout.\n\nThree other unique features of Pachisuro machines are \"stock\", \"renchan\", and {{Nihongo|''tenj\u014d''|\u5929\u4e95}}. On many machines, when enough money to afford a bonus is taken in, the bonus is not immediately awarded. Typically the game merely stops making the reels slip off the bonus symbols for a few games. If the player fails to hit the bonus during these \"standby games\", it is added to the \"stock\" for later collection. Many current games, after finishing a bonus round, set the probability to release additional stock (gained from earlier players failing to get a bonus last time the machine stopped making the reels slip for a bit) very high for the first few games. As a result, a lucky player may get to play several bonus rounds in a row (a \"renchan\"), making payouts of 5,000 or even 10,000 coins possible. The lure of \"stock\" waiting in the machine, and the possibility of \"renchan\" tease the gambler to keep feeding the machine. To tease them further, there is a ''tenj\u014d'' (ceiling), a maximum limit on the number of games between \"stock\" release. For example, if the ''tenj\u014d'' is 1,500, and the number of games played since the last bonus is 1,490, the player is guaranteed to release a bonus within just 10 games.\n\nBecause of the \"stock\", \"renchan\", and ''tenj\u014d'' systems, it is possible to make money by simply playing machines on which someone has just lost a huge amount of money. This is called being a \"[[hyena]]\". They are easy to recognize, roaming the aisles for a \"kamo\" (\"[[Gullibility|sucker]]\" in English) to leave his machine.\n\nIn short, the regulations allowing \"stock\", \"renchan\", and ''tenj\u014d'' transformed the pachisuro from a low-stakes form of entertainment just a few years back to hardcore gambling. [[Problem gambling|Many people may be gambling more than they can afford]], and the big payouts also lure unsavory \"hyena\" types into the gambling halls.\n\nTo address these social issues, a new regulation (Version 5.0) was adopted in 2006 which caps the maximum amount of \"stock\" a machine can hold to around 2,000\u20133,000 coins' worth of bonus games. Moreover, all pachisuro machines must be re-evaluated for regulation compliance every three years. Version 4.0 came out in 2004, so that means all those machines with the up to 10,000 coin payouts will be removed from service by 2007.\n\n==Problem gambling and slot machines==\nNatasha Dow Sch\u00fcll, associate professor in [[New York University]]'s Department of Media, Culture, and Communication, uses the term \"machine zone\" to describe the state of immersion that users of slot machines experience during gambling, in which they lose a sense of time, space, bodily awareness, and monetary value.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sch\u00fcll|first=Natasha|title=Addiction by Design: Machine Gambling in Las Vegas|location=Princeton, N.J.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0-69-116088-7|oclc=866583433}}</ref>\n\nMike Dixon, PhD, professor of psychology at the [[University of Waterloo]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://uwaterloo.ca/psychology/people-profiles/mike-j-dixon|title=Mike J.

Horse Head Bonus Antique Slot Machine.jpg|thumb|Mills Novelty Co. Horse Head Bonus antique slot machine]]\n\n==Skill stops==\nSkill stop buttons predated the Bally electromechanical slot machines of the 1960s and 70s. They appeared on mechanical slot machines manufactured by Mills Novelty Co. as early as the mid 1920s. These machines had modified reel-stop arms, which allowed them to be released from the timing bar, earlier than in a normal play, simply by pressing the buttons on the front of the machine, located between each reel.\n\n\"Skill stop\" buttons were added to some slot machines by Zacharias Anthony in the early 1970s. These enabled the player to stop each reel, allowing a degree of \"skill\" so as to satisfy the [[New Jersey]] gaming laws of the day which required that players were able to control the game in some way. The original conversion was applied to approximately 50 late-model Bally slot machines. Because the typical machine stopped the reels automatically in less than 10 seconds, weights were added to the mechanical timers to prolong the automatic stopping of the reels. By the time the New Jersey Alcoholic Beverages Commission (ABC) had approved the conversion for use in New Jersey arcades, the word was out and every other distributor began adding skill stops. The machines were a huge hit on the [[Jersey Shore]] and the remaining unconverted Bally machines were destroyed as they had become instantly obsolete.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Casino]]\n*[[EUROMAT|European Gaming & Amusement Federation]]\n*[[List of probability topics]]\n*[[Pachinko]]\n*[[Problem gambling]]\n*[[Progressive jackpot]]\n*[[Quiz machine]]\n*[[United States state slot machine ownership regulations]]\n*[[Video bingo]]\n*[[Video Lottery Terminal]]\n*[[Video poker]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Brisman, Andrew.

The location is a [[California Historical Landmark]].]]\nSittman and Pitt of [[Brooklyn, New York]], developed a gambling machine in 1891, which was a precursor to the modern slot machine. It contained five drums holding a total of 50 card faces based on [[poker]]. This machine proved extremely popular and soon many [[Bar (establishment)|bars]] in the city had one or more of them. Players would insert a [[Nickel (U.S. coin)|nickel]] and pull a lever, which would spin the drums and the cards they held, the player hoping for a good poker hand. There was no direct payout mechanism, so a [[Glossary of poker terms|pair of kings]] might get the player a free beer, whereas a [[Glossary of poker terms|royal flush]] could pay out cigars or drinks, the prizes wholly dependent on what was on offer at the local establishment. To make the odds better for the house, two cards were typically removed from the [[Deck (cards)|deck]]: the ten of [[Spades (suit)|spades]] and the [[Jack (playing card)|jack of hearts]], which doubles the [[odds]] against winning a royal flush. The drums could also be rearranged to further reduce a player's chance of winning.\n\nDue to the vast number of possible wins with the original poker card game, it proved practically impossible to come up with a way to make a machine capable of making an automatic payout for all possible winning combinations. Somewhere between 1887 and 1895,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slot-machine-resource.com/slot-machine-history.htm |title=History of slot machines }}</ref> [[Charles Fey]] of [[San Francisco, California]], devised a much simpler automatic mechanism<ref>{{cite web|url=http://casinogambling.about.com/od/slots/a/charlesfey.htm |title=Charles Fey article |publisher=Casinogambling.about.com |date=2009-06-22 |accessdate=2009-08-04}}</ref> with three spinning reels containing a total of five symbols: horseshoes, diamonds, spades, hearts, and a [[Liberty Bell]]. The bell gave the machine its name. By replacing ten cards with five symbols and using three reels instead of five drums, the complexity of reading a win was considerably reduced, allowing Fey to devise an effective automatic payout mechanism. Three bells in a row produced the biggest payoff, ten nickels (50\u00a2). ''Liberty Bell'' was a huge success and spawned a thriving mechanical gaming device industry. Even when, after a few years, the use of these gambling devices was banned in his home state, Fey still could not keep up with demand for them elsewhere. The Liberty Bell machine was so popular that it was copied by many slot machine manufacturers. The first of these was a machine, also called the \"Liberty Bell\", produced by the manufacturer Herbert Mills in 1907. By 1908 lots of \"bell\" machines were installed in most cigar stores, saloons, bowling alleys, brothels and barber shops.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/gallery/photo/long-colorful-profitable-history-slot-machines-55000 |title=The Long, Colorful, Profitable History of Slot Machines |publisher=The Indian Observer |accessdate=2016-07-18}}</ref> Early machines, including an 1899 \"Liberty Bell\", are now part of the Nevada State Museum's Fey Collection.<ref>{{cite web|title = CM-5716-P-06 Machine, Slot|url = http://www.nevadaculture.org/museums/new_exhibits/cc-slot_machines/exhibit1/e10007a.html|website = Nevada State Museum|accessdate = 2015-09-18}}</ref>\n\nThe first Liberty Bell machines produced by Mills used the same symbols on the reels as Charles Fey's original. Soon afterwards, another version was produced with patriotic symbols such as a flag and a wreath on the wheels. Later, a similar machine, rechristened the Operator's Bell, was designed, for which an optional gum vending attachment was available. As the gum offered was fruit-flavored, fruit symbols were placed on the reels: lemons, cherries, oranges, and plums. A bell was retained, and a picture of a stick of Bell-Fruit Gum, the origin of the bar symbol, was also present. This set of symbols proved highly popular, so was used by the other companies that began to make their own slot machines: Caille, Watling, Jennings and Pace.<ref>{{cite book |last=Fey |first=Marshall |date=1983 |title=Slot Machines A Pictorial History of the First 100 Years |location= |publisher=[[Liberty Belle Books]] |isbn=0-9623852-7-1 }}</ref>\n\nThe payment of food prizes was a commonly used technique to avoid laws against gambling in a number of states. For this reason, a number of [[gumball machine|gumball]] and other [[vending machine]]s were regarded with mistrust by the courts. The two [[Iowa]] cases of ''State v. Ellis''<ref>200 Iowa 1228, 206 N.W. 105. (Iowa, 1925).</ref> and ''State v. Striggles''<ref>202 Iowa 1318, 210 N.W. 137.

The electromechanical approach of the 1960s allowed ''Money Honey'' to be the first slot machine with a bottomless hopper and automatic payout of up to 500 coins without the help of an attendant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ballytech.com/company-information |title=Bally Technologies, Inc. &#124; Company Information |publisher=Ballytech.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-04}}</ref> The popularity of this machine led to the increasing predominance of [[electronic game]]s, with the side lever soon becoming vestigial.\n\nThe first video slot machine was developed in 1976 in [[Kearny Mesa, California]], by the Las Vegas\u2013based Fortune Coin Co. This slot machine used a modified {{convert|19|in|cm|adj=on}} Sony Trinitron color receiver for the display and logic boards for all slot machine functions. The prototype was mounted in a full-size show-ready slot machine cabinet. The first production units went on trial in the [[Las Vegas Hilton Hotel]]. After some \"cheat-proofing\" modifications, the video slot machine was approved by the Nevada State Gaming Commission and eventually found popularity in the [[Las Vegas Strip]] and downtown casinos. Fortune Coin Co. and their video slot machine technology were purchased by IGT (International Gaming Technology) in 1978.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nThe first American video slot machine to offer a \"second screen\" bonus round was ''Reel \u2019Em In'' developed by [[WMS Industries]] in 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.casinocenter.com/?p=834|title=HALL OF FAME IN SLOT GAMES : Casino Player Magazine - Strictly Slots Magazine - Casino Gambling Tips|work=casinocenter.com}}</ref> This type of machine had appeared in Australia from at least 1994 with the \"Three Bags Full\" game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arcade-history.com/?n=3-bags-full&page=detail&id=5056|title=3 Bags Full|work=arcade-history.com}}</ref> In this type of machine, the display changes to provide a different game where an additional payout may be won or accumulated.\n\n==Operation==\n[[Image:Vegas slots.JPG|left|thumb|A row of \"Wheel of Fortune\" slot machines in a casino in Las Vegas. This specific slot machine is themed to the TV game show ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]''.]]\n\nA person playing a slot machine can insert cash or, in \"[[ticket-in, ticket-out]]\" machines, a paper ticket with a [[barcode]], into a designated slot on the machine. The machine is then activated by means of a lever or button (either physical or on a touchscreen), which activates reels that spin and stop to reveal one or several symbols. Most games have a variety of winning combinations of symbols. If a player matches a combination according to the rules of the game, the slot machine credits the player. Symbols can vary depending on the machine, but often include objects such as fruits, bells, and stylized [[Luck#Numerology|lucky sevens]]. Most slot games have a theme, such as a specific [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]], location, or character. Symbols and other bonus features of the game are typically aligned with the theme. Some themes are licensed from popular [[media franchise]]s, including films, television series (including [[game show]]s such as ''[[Wheel of Fortune (American game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]''), entertainers, and musicians.\n\nMulti-line slot machines have become more popular since the 1990s. These machines have more than one payline, meaning that visible symbols that are not aligned on the main horizontal may be considered for winning combinations. Traditional 3-reel slot machines commonly have three or five paylines while video slot machines may have 9, 15, 25, or as many as 1024 different paylines. Most accept variable numbers of credits to play, with 1 to 15 credits per line being typical. The higher the amount bet, the higher the payout will be if the player wins. \n\nOne of the main differences between video slot machines and reel machines is in the way payouts are calculated. With reel machines, the only way to win the maximum jackpot is to play the maximum number of coins (usually 3, sometimes 4 or even 5 coins per spin). With video machines, the fixed payout values are multiplied by the number of coins per line that is being bet. In other words: on a reel machine, the odds are more favorable if the gambler plays with the maximum number of coins available.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Harris|first1=Tom|title=How Slot Machines Work|url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/slot-machine4.htm|accessdate=10 July 2014|date=2002-02-26}}</ref> However, depending on the structure of the game and its bonus features, some video slots may still include features that improve chances at payouts by making increased wagers.\n\n\"Multi-way\" games eschew fixed paylines in favor of allowing symbols to pay anywhere, as long as there is at least one in at least 3 consecutive reels from left to right. Multi-way games may be configured to allow players to bet by-reel: for example, on a game with a 3x5 pattern (often referred to as a 243-way game), playing one reel allows all three symbols in the first reel to potentially pay, but only the center row pays on the remaining reels (often designated by darkening the unused portions of the reels). Other multi-way games use a 4x5 or 5x5 pattern, where there are up to 5 symbols in each reel, allowing for up to 1,024 and 3,125 ways to win respectively. The Australian manufacturer [[Aristocrat Leisure]] brands games featuring this system as \"Reel Power\", \"Xtra Reel Power\" and \"Super Reel Power\" respectively. A variation involves patterns where symbols pay adjacent to one another. Most of these games have a hexagonal reel formation, and much like multi-way games, any patterns not played are darkened out of use.\n\nDenominations can range from 1 cent (\"penny slots\") all the way up to $100.00 or more per credit. The latter are typically known as \"high limit\" machines, and machines configured to allow for such wagers are often located in dedicated areas (which may have a separate team of attendants to cater to the needs of those who play there). The machine automatically calculates the number of credits the player receives in exchange for the cash inserted. Newer machines often allow players to choose from a selection of denominations on a [[splash screen]] or menu.\n\n==Terminology==\nA '''bonus''' is a special feature of the particular game theme, which is activated when certain symbols appear in a winning combination. Bonuses and the number of bonus features vary depending upon the game. Some bonus rounds are a special session of free spins (the number of which is often based on the winning combination that triggers the bonus), often with a different or modified set of winning combinations as the main game and/or other multipliers or increased frequencies of symbols, or a \"hold and re-spin\" mechanic in which specific symbols (usually marked with values of credits or other prizes) are collected and locked in place over a finite number of spins. In other bonus rounds, the player is presented with several items on a screen from which to choose. As the player chooses items, a number of credits is revealed and awarded. Some bonuses use a mechanical device, such as a spinning wheel, that works in conjunction with the bonus to display the amount won. \n\nA '''candle''' is a light on top of the slot machine. It flashes to alert the operator that change is needed, hand pay is requested or a potential problem with the machine. It can be lit by the player by pressing the \"service\" or \"help\" button.\n\n'''Carousel''' refers to a grouping of slot machines, usually in a circle or oval formation.\n\nA '''coin hopper''' is a container where the coins that are immediately available for payouts are held. The hopper is a mechanical device that rotates coins into the coin tray when a player collects credits/coins (by pressing a \"Cash Out\" button). When a certain preset coin capacity is reached, a coin diverter automatically redirects, or \"drops\", excess coins into a \"drop bucket\" or \"drop box\". (Unused coin hoppers can still be found even on games that exclusively employ Ticket-In, Ticket-Out technology, as a vestige.)\n\nThe '''credit meter''' is a display of the amount of money or number of credits on the machine. On mechanical slot machines, this is usually a [[seven-segment display]], but video slot machines typically use stylized text that suits the game's theme and user interface.\n\nThe '''drop bucket''' or '''drop box''' is a container located in a slot machine's base where excess coins are diverted from the hopper. Typically, a drop bucket is used for low-denomination slot machines and a drop box is used for high-denomination slot machines. A drop box contains a hinged lid with one or more locks whereas a drop bucket does not contain a lid. The contents of drop buckets and drop boxes are collected and [[hard count|counted]] by the casino on a scheduled basis.\n\n'''EGM''' is short for \"Electronic Gaming Machine\".\n\n'''Free spins''' are a common form of bonus, where a series of spins are automatically played at no charge at the player's current wager. Free spins are usually triggered via a scatter of at least three designated symbols (with the number of spins dependent on the number of symbols that land). Some games allow the free spins bonus to \"retrigger\", which adds additional spins on top of those already awarded. There is no theoretical limit to the number of free spins obtainable. Some games may have other features that can also trigger over the course of free spins.\n\nA '''[[hand pay]]''' refers to a payout made by an attendant or at an exchange point (\"cage\"), rather than by the slot machine itself. A hand pay occurs when the amount of the payout exceeds the maximum amount that was preset by the slot machine's operator. Usually, the maximum amount is set at the level where the operator must begin to deduct taxes. A hand pay could also be necessary as a result of a short pay.\n\n'''Hopper fill slip''' is a document used to record the replenishment of the coin in the coin hopper after it becomes depleted as a result of making payouts to players. The slip indicates the amount of coin placed into the hoppers, as well as the signatures of the employees involved in the transaction, the slot machine number and the location and the date.\n\n'''MEAL book''' ('''''M'''''achine '''''e'''''ntry '''''a'''''uthorization '''''l'''''og) is a log of the employee's entries into the machine.\n\n'''Low-level''' or '''slant-top''' slot machines include a stool so the player may sit down. '''Stand-up''' or '''upright''' slot machines are played while standing.\n\n'''Optimal play''' is a payback percentage based on a gambler using the optimal strategy in a skill-based slot machine game.\n\n'''Payline''' is a line that crosses through one symbol on each reel, along which a winning combination is evaluated. Classic spinning reel machines usually have up to nine paylines, while video slot machines may have as many as one hundred. Paylines could be of various shapes (horizontal, vertical, oblique, triangular, zigzag, etc.)\n\n'''Persistent state''' refers to passive features on some slot machines, some of which able to trigger bonus payouts or other special features if certain conditions are met over time by players on that machine.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.casinojournal.com/articles/93279-slot-machine-trends-featured-at-g2e?v=preview|title=Slot machine trends featured at G2E|last=|first=|date=|website=Casino Journal|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref>\n\n'''Roll-up''' is the process of dramatizing a win by playing sounds while the '''meters''' count up to the amount that has been won.\n\n'''Short pay''' refers to a partial payout made by a slot machine, which is less than the amount due to the player. This occurs if the coin hopper has been depleted as a result of making earlier payouts to players. The remaining amount due to the player is either paid as a hand pay or an attendant will come and refill the machine.\n\nA '''scatter''' is a pay combination based on occurrences of a designated symbol landing anywhere on the reels, rather than falling in sequence on the same payline. A scatter pay usually requires a minimum of three symbols to land, and the machine may offer increased prizes or jackpots depending on the number that land. Scatters are frequently used to trigger bonus games, such as free spins (with the number of spins multiplying based on the number of scatter symbols that land). The scatter symbol usually cannot be matched using wilds, and some games may require the scatter symbols to appear on consecutive reels in order to pay. On some multiway games, scatter symbols still pay in unused areas.\n\n'''Taste''' is a reference to the small amount often paid out to keep a player seated and continuously betting. Only rarely will machines fail to pay even the minimum out over the course of several pulls.\n\n[[Image:Slot machine Tilt error.jpg|right|thumb|Display screen of a slot machine in tilt mode]]\n'''Tilt''' is a term derived from electromechanical slot machines' \"[[mercury switch|tilt switches]]\", which would make or break a circuit when they were tilted or otherwise tampered with that triggered an alarm. While modern machines no longer have tilt switches, any kind of technical fault (door switch in the wrong state, reel motor failure, out of paper, etc.) is still called a \"tilt\".\n\nA '''theoretical hold worksheet''' is a document provided by the manufacturer for every slot machine that indicates the theoretical percentage the machine should hold based on the amount paid in. The worksheet also indicates the reel strip settings, number of coins that may be played, the payout schedule, the number of reels and other information descriptive of the particular type of slot machine.\n\n'''Volatility''' or '''variance''' refers to the measure of risk associated with playing a slot machine. A low-volatility slot machine has regular but smaller wins, while a high-variance slot machine has fewer but bigger wins.\n\n'''Weight count''' is an American term referring to the total value of coins or tokens removed from a slot machine's drop bucket or drop box for counting by the casino's [[hard count]] team through the use of a weigh scale.\n\n'''Wild symbols''' substitute for most other symbols in the game (similarly to a [[Joker (playing card)|joker]] card), usually excluding scatter and jackpot symbols (or offering a lower prize on non-natural combinations that include wilds). How jokers behave are dependent on the specific game and whether the player is in a bonus or free games mode. Sometimes wild symbols may only appear on certain reels, or have a chance to \"stack\" across the entire reel.\n\n==Pay table==\n{{Main|Pay table}}\nEach machine has a table that lists the number of credits the player will receive if the symbols listed on the pay table line up on the pay line of the machine. Some symbols are wild and can represent many, or all, of the other symbols to complete a winning line. Especially on older machines, the pay table is listed on the face of the machine, usually above and below the area containing the wheels. On video slot machines, they are usually contained within a help menu, along with information on other features.\n\n==Technology==\n===Reels===\nHistorically, all slot machines used revolving mechanical reels to display and determine results. Although the original slot machine used five reels, simpler, and therefore more reliable, three reel machines quickly became the standard.\n\nA problem with three reel machines is that the number of combinations is only [[cube (algebra)|cubic]] &ndash; the original slot machine with three physical reels and 10 symbols on each reel had only 10<sup>3</sup> = 1,000 possible combinations. This limited the manufacturer's ability to offer large jackpots since even the rarest event had a likelihood of 0.1%. The maximum theoretical payout, assuming 100% return to player would be 1000 times the bet, but that would leave no room for other pays, making the machine very high risk, and also quite boring.\n\nAlthough the number of symbols eventually increased to about 22, allowing 10,648 combinations,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gaming.unlv.edu/reading/Pacyniak.PDF |title=Info |website=gaming.unlv.edu }}</ref> this still limited jackpot sizes as well as the number of possible outcomes.\n\nIn the 1980s, however, slot machine manufacturers incorporated electronics into their products and programmed them to weight particular symbols. Thus the odds of losing symbols appearing on the payline became disproportionate to their actual frequency on the physical reel. A symbol would only appear once on the reel displayed to the player, but could, in fact, occupy several stops on the multiple reel.\n\nIn 1984 Inge Telnaes received a patent for a device titled, \"Electronic Gaming Device Utilizing a Random Number Generator for Selecting the Reel Stop Positions\" (US Patent 4448419),<ref>{{US patent|4448419|Electronic gaming device utilizing a random number generator for selecting the reel stop positions}}</ref> which states: \"It is important to make a machine that is perceived to present greater chances of payoff than it actually has within the legal limitations that games of chance must operate.\" <ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last=Collier |first=Roger\n |date=1 July 2008\n |title=Do slot machines play mind games with gamblers?\n |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal\n |volume=179 |issue=1 |pages=23\u20134\n |doi=10.1503/cmaj.080870\n |pmc=2464464\n |pmid=18591518\n}}</ref> The patent was later bought by [[International Game Technology (1975)|International Game Technology]] and has since expired.\n\nA virtual reel that has 256 virtual stops per reel would allow up to 256<sup>3</sup> = 16,777,216 final positions. The manufacturer could choose to offer a $1 million dollar jackpot on a $1 bet, confident that it will only happen, over the long term, once every 16.8 million plays.\n\n===Computerization===\nWith [[microprocessor]]s now ubiquitous, the computers inside modern slot machines allow manufacturers to assign a different probability to every symbol on every reel. To the player it might appear that a winning symbol was \"so close\", whereas in fact the probability is much lower.\n\nIn the 1980s in the U.K., machines embodying microprocessors became common. These used a number of features to ensure the payout was controlled within the limits of the gambling legislation. As a coin was inserted into the machine, it could go either directly into the cashbox for the benefit of the owner or into a channel that formed the payout reservoir, with the microprocessor monitoring the number of coins in this channel. The drums themselves were driven by stepper motors, controlled by the processor and with proximity sensors monitoring the position of the drums. A \"look-up table\" within the software allows the processor to know what symbols were being displayed on the drums to the gambler. This allowed the system to control the level of payout by stopping the drums at positions it had determined. If the payout channel had filled up, the payout became more generous; if nearly empty, the payout became less so (thus giving good control of the odds).\n\n===Video slot machines===\nVideo slot machines do not use mechanical reels, instead using graphical reels on a computerized [[Display device|display]]. As there are no mechanical constraints on the design of video slot machines, games often use at least five reels, and may also use non-standard layouts. This greatly expands the number of possibilities: a machine can have 50 or more symbols on a reel, giving [[odds]] as high as 300 million to 1 against &ndash; enough for even the largest jackpot. As there are so many combinations possible with five reels, manufacturers do not need to weight the payout symbols (although some may still do so). Instead, higher-paying symbols will typically appear only once or twice on each reel, while more common symbols earning a more frequent payout will appear many times. Video slot machines usually make more extensive use of [[multimedia]], and can feature more elaborate [[minigame]]s as bonuses. Modern cabinets typically use [[flat-panel display]]s, but cabinets using larger [[Curved screen|curved screens]] (which can provide a more immersive experience for the player) are not uncommon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/6/8544303/casino-slot-machine-gambling-addiction-psychology-mobile-games|title=Slot machines perfected addictive gaming. Now, tech wants their tricks|last=Thompson|first=Andrew|date=2015-05-06|website=The Verge|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-30}}</ref>\n\nVideo slot machines typically encourage the player to play multiple \"lines\": rather than simply taking the middle of the three symbols displayed on each reel, a line could go from top left to bottom right or any other pattern specified by the manufacturer. As each symbol is equally likely, there is no difficulty for the manufacturer in allowing the player to take as many of the possible lines on offer as desire &ndash; the long-term return to the player will be the same. The difference for the player is that, the more lines they play, the more likely they are to get paid on a given spin (because they are betting more).\n\nTo avoid seeming as if the player's money is simply ebbing away (whereas a payout of 100 credits on a single-line machine would be 100 bets and the player would feel they had made a substantial win, on a 20-line machine, it would only be 5 bets and not seem as significant), manufacturers commonly offer bonus games, which can return many times their bet. The player is encouraged to keep playing to reach the bonus: even if he is losing, the bonus game could allow then to win back their losses.\n===Random number generators===\nAll modern machines are designed using [[pseudo random number generator|pseudorandom number generator]]s (\"PRNGs\"), which are constantly generating a sequence of simulated random numbers, at a rate of hundreds or perhaps thousands per second. As soon as the \"Play\" button is pressed, the most recent random number is used to determine the result. This means that the result varies depending on exactly when the game is played. A fraction of a second earlier or later and the result would be different.\n\nIt is important that the machine contains a high-quality RNG implementation. Because all PRNGs must eventually repeat their number sequence<ref>{{cite book|title=Art of Computer Programming|volume=II. Seminumerical Algorithms|edition=1st|chapter=3. Random numbers|last=Knuth|first=Donald E.|authorlink=Donald Knuth|date=|pp=3\u20134|title-link=Art of Computer Programming}}</ref> and, if the period is short or the PRNG is otherwise flawed, an advanced player may be able to \"predict\" the next result. Having access to the PRNG code and seed values, [[Ronald Dale Harris]], a former slot machine programmer, discovered equations for specific gambling games like [[Keno]] that allowed him to predict what the next set of selected numbers would be based on the previous games played.\n\nMost machines are designed to defeat this by generating numbers even when the machine is not being played so the player cannot tell where in the sequence they are, even if they know how the machine was programmed.\n\n===Payout percentage===\n{{Globalize|section|date=April 2019}}\nSlot machines are typically programmed to pay out as winnings 82% to 98% of the money that is wagered by players. This is known as the \"theoretical payout percentage\" or RTP, \"return to player\". The minimum theoretical payout percentage varies among jurisdictions and is typically established by law or regulation. For example, the minimum payout in [[Nevada]] is 75%, in [[New Jersey]] 83%, and in Mississippi 80%. The winning patterns on slot machines &ndash; the amounts they pay and the frequencies of those payouts &ndash; are carefully selected to yield a certain fraction of the money payed to the \"house\" (the operator of the slot machine) while returning the rest to the players during play. Suppose that a certain slot machine costs $1 per spin and has a return to player (RTP) of 95%. It can be calculated that, over a sufficiently long period such as 1,000,000 spins, the machine will return an average of $950,000 to its players, who have inserted $1,000,000 during that time. In this (simplified) example, the slot machine is said to pay out 95%. The operator keeps the remaining $50,000. Within some EGM development organizations this concept is referred to simply as \"par\". \"Par\" also manifests itself to gamblers as promotional techniques: \"Our 'Loose Slots' have a 93% payback! Play now!\"{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nA slot machine's theoretical payout percentage is set at the factory when the [[software]] is written. Changing the payout percentage after a slot machine has been placed on the gaming floor requires a physical swap of the software or ''[[firmware]]'', which is usually stored on an [[EPROM]] but may be loaded onto non-volatile random access memory ([[NVRAM]]) or even stored on [[CD-ROM]] or [[DVD]], depending on the capabilities of the machine and the applicable regulations. {{citation needed span|date=April 2019|text=Based on current technology, this is a time-consuming process and as such is done infrequently.}} In certain jurisdictions, such as New Jersey, the EPROM has a [[tamper-evident]] [[security seal|seal]] and can only be changed in the presence of [[Gaming Control Board]] officials. Other jurisdictions, including Nevada, randomly [[audit]] slot machines to ensure that they contain only approved software.\n\nHistorically, many casinos, both online and offline, have been unwilling to publish individual game RTP figures, making it impossible for the player to know whether they are playing a \"loose\" or a \"tight\" game. Since the turn of the century some information regarding these figures has started to come into the public domain either through various casinos releasing them\u2014primarily this applies to online casinos\u2014or through studies by independent gambling authorities.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe ''return to player'' is not the only statistic that is of interest. The probabilities of every payout on the pay table is also critical. For example, consider a hypothetical slot machine with a dozen different values on the pay table. However, the probabilities of getting all the payouts are zero except the largest one. If the payout is 4,000 times the input amount, and it happens every 4,000 times on average, the ''return to player'' is exactly 100%, but the game would be dull to play. Also, most people would not win anything, and having entries on the paytable that have a return of zero would be deceptive. As these individual probabilities are closely guarded secrets, it is possible that the advertised machines with high return to player simply increase the probabilities of these jackpots. The casino could legally place machines of a similar style payout and advertise that some machines have 100% return to player. The added advantage is that these large jackpots increase the excitement of the other players.\n\nThe table of probabilities for a specific machine is called the Probability and Accounting Report or PAR sheet, also PARS commonly understood as Paytable and Reel Strips. Mathematician [[Michael Shackleford]] revealed the PARS for one commercial slot machine, an original [[International Gaming Technology]] ''Red White and Blue'' machine. This game, in its original form, is obsolete, so these specific probabilities do not apply. He only published the odds after a fan of his sent him some information provided on a slot machine that was posted on a machine in the Netherlands. The psychology of the machine design is quickly revealed. There are 13 possible payouts ranging from 1:1 to 2,400:1. The 1:1 payout comes every 8 plays. The 5:1 payout comes every 33 plays, whereas the 2:1 payout comes every 600 plays. Most players assume the likelihood increases proportionate to the payout. The one mid-size payout that is designed to give the player a thrill is the 80:1 payout. It is programmed to occur an average of once every 219 plays. The 80:1 payout is high enough to create excitement, but not high enough that it makes it likely that the player will take his winnings and abandon the game. More than likely the player began the game with at least 80 times his bet (for instance there are 80 quarters in $20). In contrast the 150:1 payout occurs only on average of once every 6,241 plays. The highest payout of 2,400:1 occurs only on average of once every 64<sup>3</sup> = 262,144 plays since the machine has 64 virtual stops. The player who continues to feed the machine is likely to have several mid-size payouts, but unlikely to have a large payout. He quits after he is bored or has exhausted his bankroll.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n\nDespite their confidentiality, occasionally a PAR sheet is posted on a website. They have limited value to the player, because usually a machine will have 8 to 12 different possible programs with varying payouts. In addition, slight variations of each machine (e.g., with ''double jackpots'' or ''five times play'') are always being developed. The casino operator can choose which EPROM chip to install in any particular machine to select the payout desired. The result is that there is not really such a thing as a high payback type of machine, since every machine potentially has multiple settings. From October 2001 to February 2002, columnist Michael Shackleford obtained PAR sheets for five different nickel machines; four IGT games ''[[Austin Powers (disambiguation)|Austin Powers]]'', ''Fortune Cookie'', ''Leopard Spots'' and ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' and one game manufactured by WMS; ''Reel 'em In''. Without revealing the proprietary information, he developed a program that would allow him to determine with usually less than a dozen plays on each machine which EPROM chip was installed. Then he did a survey of over 400 machines in 70 different casinos in Las Vegas. He averaged the data, and assigned an average payback percentage to the machines in each casino. The resultant list was widely publicized for marketing purposes (especially by the Palms casino which had the top ranking).{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n\nOne reason that the slot machine is so profitable to a casino is that the player must play the ''high house edge and high payout'' wagers along with the ''low house edge and low payout'' wagers. In a more traditional wagering game like craps, the player knows that certain wagers have almost a 50/50 chance of winning or losing, but they only pay a limited multiple of the original bet (usually no higher than three times). Other bets have a higher house edge, but the player is rewarded with a bigger win (up to thirty times in craps). The player can choose what kind of wager he wants to make. A slot machine does not afford such an opportunity. Theoretically, the operator could make these probabilities available, or allow the player to choose which one so that the player is free to make a choice. However, no operator has ever enacted this strategy. Different machines have different maximum payouts, but without knowing the odds of getting the jackpot, there is no rational way to differentiate.\n\nIn many markets where central monitoring and control systems are used to link machines for auditing and security purposes, usually in wide area networks of multiple venues and thousands of machines, player return must usually be changed from a central computer rather than at each machine. A range of percentages is set in the game software and selected remotely.\n\nIn 2006, the Nevada Gaming Commission began working with Las Vegas casinos on technology that would allow the casino's management to change the game, the odds, and the payouts remotely. The change cannot be done instantaneously, but only after the selected machine has been idle for at least four minutes. After the change is made, the machine must be locked to new players for four minutes and display an on-screen message informing potential players that a change is being made.<ref>{{cite news|last=Richtel |first=Matt |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/12/technology/12casino.html?ei=5089&en=9e945a28ba5016c6&ex=1302494400&partner=rssyahoo&emc=rss&pagewanted=all |title=From the Back Office, a Casino Can Change the Slot Machine in Seconds|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=12 April 2009|accessdate=10 December 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Linked machines===\nSome varieties of slot machines can be linked together in a setup sometimes known as a \"community\" game. The most basic form of this setup involves [[progressive jackpot]]s that are shared between the bank of machines, but may include multiplayer bonuses and other features.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.casinojournal.com/articles/89815-the-latest-community-slot-games-offer-play-mechanics-and-features-designed-to-overcome-the-shortfalls-of-previous-products-and-concepts?v=preview|title=The latest community slot games offer play mechanics and features designed to overcome the shortfalls of previous products and concepts|website=Casino Journal|language=en|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref>\n\nIn some cases multiple machines are linked across multiple casinos. In these cases, the machines may be owned by the manufacturer, who is responsible for paying the jackpot. The casinos [[lease]] the machines rather than owning them outright. Casinos in New Jersey, Nevada, and [[South Dakota]] now offer multi-state progressive jackpots, which now offer bigger jackpot pools.<ref>{{cite web|title=Division of Gaming Enforcement Announces Approval for Interstate Progressive Slot Machines|url=http://www.nj.gov/oag/ge/2014news/MultistateProgressiveSlotMachines.pdf|website=New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Division of Gaming Enforcement Announces Interstate Progressive Slots Link with Nevada|url=http://www.nj.gov/oag/ge/2014news/Multistate%20ProgressiveSlots.pdf|website=New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement}}</ref>\n\n===Fraud===\nMechanical slot machines and their coin acceptors were sometimes susceptible to cheating devices and other scams. One historical example involved spinning a coin with a short length of plastic wire. The weight and size of the coin would be accepted by the machine and credits would be granted. However, the spin created by the plastic wire would cause the coin to exit through the reject chute into the payout tray. This particular scam has become obsolete due to improvements in newer slot machines. Another obsolete method of defeating slot machines was to use a light source to confuse the optical sensor used to count coins during payout.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/news/2003-08-11-slot-cheats_x.htm |title=Slot machine cheat bilked casinos with ingenious gadgets |newspaper=USAToday.com |accessdate=2014-06-08}}</ref>\n\nModern slot machines are controlled by EPROM computer chips and, in large casinos, coin acceptors have become obsolete in favor of bill acceptors. These machines and their bill acceptors are designed with advanced anti-cheating and anti-counterfeiting measures and are difficult to defraud. Early computerized slot machines were sometimes defrauded through the use of cheating devices, such as the \"slider\" or \"monkey paw\".  Computerized slot machines are fully deterministic and thus outcomes can be sometimes successfully predicted.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Koerner|first1=Brendan|title=Russians Engineer a Brilliant Slot Machine Cheat\u2014And Casinos Have No Fix|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/02/russians-engineer-brilliant-slot-machine-cheat-casinos-no-fix|accessdate=7 February 2017|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=8 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Jackpot errors===\nMalfunctioning electronic slot machines are capable of indicating jackpot winnings far in excess of those advertised.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wcfcourier.com/news/local/woman-sues-isle-after-she-s-denied-million-from-slot/article_411d78f2-28a0-5e0a-bc16-73e8c79fc3b7.html|title=Woman sues Isle after she's denied $42 million from slot malfunction|author=Jeff Reinitz|work=Waterloo Cedar Falls Courier}}</ref> Two such cases occurred in casinos in Colorado in 2010, where [[Software bug|software errors]] led to indicated jackpots of $11 million and $42 million.{{cn|date=August 2019}} Analysis of machine records by the state Gaming Commission revealed faults, with the true jackpot being substantially smaller.<ref>[https://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/software/woman-who-thought-she-won-42-million-at-casino-gets-2018 Woman Who Thought She Won $42 Million At Casino Gets $20.18 Instead ''IEEE Spectrum'' 25 May 2010 ]</ref> State gaming laws do not require a casino to honour payouts.\n\n==Legislation==\n===United States===\nIn the United States, the public and private availability of slot machines is [[United States state slot machine ownership regulations|highly regulated by state governments]]. Many states have established [[gaming control board]]s to regulate the possession and use of slot machines and other form of gaming.\n\n[[Nevada]] is the only state that has no significant restrictions against slot machines both for public and private use. In [[New Jersey]], slot machines are only allowed in hotel casinos operated in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]]. Several states ([[Indiana]], [[Louisiana]] and [[Missouri]]) allow slot machines (as well as any casino-style gambling) only on licensed [[riverboat]]s or permanently anchored [[barge]]s. Since [[Hurricane Katrina]], [[Mississippi]] has removed the requirement that casinos on the Gulf Coast operate on barges and now allows them on land along the shoreline. [[Delaware]] allows slot machines at three horse tracks; they are regulated by the [[Delaware Lottery|state lottery]] commission. In Wisconsin, bars and taverns are allowed to have up to five machines. These machines usually allow a player to either take a payout, or gamble it on a double-or-nothing \"side game\". \n\nThe [[Unincorporated territories of the United States|territory]] of [[Puerto Rico]] places significant restrictions on slot machine ownership, but the law is widely flouted and slot machines are common in bars and coffeeshops.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/765596778/Illegal-slot-machines-threaten-Puerto-Rico-casinos.html?pg=all|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|last=Coto|first=Danica|date=August 13, 2012|title=Illegal slot machines threaten Puerto Rico casinos|accessdate=June 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn regards to [[Native American gaming|tribal casinos]] located on [[Indian reservation|Native American reservations]], slot machines played against the house and operating independently from a [[centralized system|centralized computer system]] are classified as \"Class III\" gaming by the [[Indian Gaming Regulatory Act]] (IGRA), and sometimes promoted as \"Vegas-style\" slot machines.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://southfloridareporter.com/10-casinos-you-can-gamble-at-in-south-florida/|title=10 Casinos You Can Gamble at in South Florida|last=SouthFloridaReporter.com|date=2018-09-05|website=South Florida Reporter|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-10}}</ref> In order to offer Class III gaming, tribes must enter into a [[Tribal-state compacts|compact]] (agreement) with the state that is approved by the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]], which may contain restrictions on the types and quantity of such games.

The first Australian state to legalize this style of gambling was [[New South Wales]], when in 1956 they were made legal in all registered clubs in the state. There are suggestions that the proliferation of poker machines has led to increased levels of [[problem gambling]]; however, the precise nature of this link is still open to research.<ref>[http://www.pc.gov.au/inquiry/gambling/finalreport/index.html PC.gov.au] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819030433/http://www.pc.gov.au/inquiry/gambling/finalreport/index.html |date=2006-08-19 }}, see Chapter 8, Productivity Commission Report no. 10</ref>\n\nIn 1999 the Australian Productivity Commission reported that nearly half Australia's gaming machines were in New South Wales.

Australia ranks 8th in total number of gaming machines after Japan, U.S.A., Italy, U.K., Spain and Germany. This primarily is because gaming machines have been legal in the state of New South Wales since 1956; over time, the number of machines has grown to 97,103 (at December 2010, including the Australian Capital Territory). By way of comparison, the U.S. State of Nevada, which legalised gaming including slots several decades before N.S.W., had 190,135 slots operating.<ref>{{cite news|title=One pokie for every 110 of us|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/one-pokie-for-every-110-of-us-20100116-mdf3.html|accessdate=28 November 2015|agency=SMH|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=17 January 2010}}</ref>\n\nRevenue from gaming machines in pubs and clubs accounts for more than half of the $4 billion in gambling revenue collected by state governments in fiscal year 2002&ndash;03.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn [[Queensland]], gaming machines in pubs and clubs must provide a return rate of 85%, while machines located in casinos must provide a return rate of 90%.{{cn|date=August 2019}} Most other states have similar provisions.

As of December 1, 2007, Victoria banned gaming machines that accepted $100 notes; all gaming machines made since 2003 comply with this rule. This new law also banned machines with an automatic play option. One exception exists in Crown Casino for any player with a VIP loyalty card: they can still insert $100 notes and use an autoplay feature (whereby the machine will automatically play until credit is exhausted or the player intervenes). All gaming machines in Victoria have an information screen accessible to the user by pressing the \"i key\" button, showing the game rules, paytable, return to player percentage, and the top and bottom five combinations with their odds. These combinations are stated to be played on a minimum bet (usually 1 credit per line, with 1 line or reel played, although some newer machines do not have an option to play 1 line; some machines may only allow maximum lines to be played), excluding feature wins.\n\n[[Western Australia]] only permits certain forms of gaming machine in [[Burswood Entertainment Complex|Burswood casino]] and no gaming machines elsewhere. This policy (the most restrictive in Australia) had an extensive political history, reaffirmed by the 1974 Royal Commission into Gambling:<ref>Western Australia, Report of the Royal Commission into Gambling (1974), pp.\u200772\u201373.</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=Poker machine playing is a mindless, repetitive and insidious form of gambling which has many undesirable features. It requires no thought, no skill or social contact. The odds are never about winning. Watching people playing the machines over long periods of time, the impressionistic evidence at least is that they are addictive to many people. Historically poker machines have been banned from Western Australia and we consider that, in the public interest, they should stay banned.|sign=|source=}}\n\nWhile Western Australian gaming machines are similar to the other states', they do not have spinning reels. Therefore different animations are used in place of the spinning reels in order to display each game result.\n\n[[Nick Xenophon]] was elected on an independent [[No Pokies]] ticket in the [[South Australian Legislative Council]] at the [[1997 South Australian state election]] on 2.9 percent, re-elected at the [[2006 South Australian state election|2006 election]] on 20.5 percent, and elected to the [[Australian Senate]] at the [[2007 Australian federal election|2007 federal election]] on 14.8 percent. Independent candidate [[Andrew Wilkie]], an anti-pokies campaigner, was elected to the [[Australian House of Representatives]] seat of [[Division of Denison|Denison]] at the [[2010 Australian federal election|2010 federal election]]. Wilkie was one of four crossbenchers who supported the [[Julia Gillard|Gillard]] [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government following the [[hung parliament]] result. Wilkie immediately began forging ties with Xenophon as soon as it was apparent that he was elected. In exchange for Wilkie's support, the Labor government are attempting to implement pre-commitment technology for high-bet/high-intensity poker machines, against opposition from the [[Tony Abbott]] [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] and Clubs Australia.\n\n=== Russia ===\nIn Russia, \"slot clubs\" appeared quite late, only in 1992. Before 1992, slot machines were only in casinos and small shops, but later slot clubs began appearing all over the country. The most popular and numerous were \"Vulcan 777\" and \"Taj Mahal\". Since 2009 when gambling establishments were banned, almost all slot clubs disappeared and are found only in a specially authorized gambling zones.\n\n===United Kingdom=== <!-- [[Fixed odds betting terminal]] links here. -->\n[[Image:Old fruit machines in Teignmouth 10-08-06.jpg|thumb|right|Row of old fruit machines in Teignmouth Pier, Devon]]\n[[Image:Slot machines at Wookey Hole Caves.JPG|thumb|right|One armed bandits at [[Wookey Hole Caves]]]]\nSlot machines are covered by the [[Gambling Act 2005]], which superseded the [[Gaming Act 1968]].<ref name=GamingAct>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2005/20052776.htm|title=Gaming Act 2005|year=2005|publisher=[[The Stationery Office]]|accessdate=2 November 2009}}</ref>\n\nSlot machines in the U.K. are categorised by definitions produced by the [[Gambling Commission]] as part of the Gambling Act of 2005.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

As defined by the 2005 Act, large casinos can have a maximum of one hundred and fifty machines in any combination of categories B\u2013D (subject to a machine-to-table ratio of 5:1); small casinos can have a maximum of eighty machines in any combination of categories B\u2013D (subject to a machine-to-table ratio of 2:1).\n\n====Category A====\nCategory A games were defined in preparation for the planned \"[[Regional casino|Super Casinos]]\". Despite a lengthy bidding process with [[Manchester]] being chosen as the single planned location, the development was cancelled soon after [[Gordon Brown]] became [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]. As a result, there are no lawful Category A games in the U.K.\n\n====Category B====\nCategory B games are divided into subcategories. The differences between B1, B3 and B4 games are mainly the stake and prizes as defined in the above table. Category B2 games &ndash; [[Fixed odds betting terminal]]s (FOBTs) &ndash; have quite different stake and prize rules: FOBTs are mainly found in licensed [[betting shop]]s, or bookmakers, usually in the form of electronic [[roulette]].\n\nThe games are based on a [[random number generation|random number generator]]; thus each game's probability of getting the jackpot is independent of any other game: probabilities are all equal. If a [[pseudorandom number generator]] is used instead of a truly random one, probabilities are not independent since each number is determined at least in part by the one generated before it.\n\n====Category C====\nCategory C games are often referred to as '''fruit machines''', '''one-armed bandits''' and '''AWP''' ([[amusement with prize]]). Fruit machines are commonly found in [[public house|pubs]], [[Nightclub|club]]s, and [[video arcade|arcade]]s. Machines commonly have three but can be found with four or five reels, each with 16\u201324 symbols printed around them. The reels are spun each play, from which the appearance of particular combinations of symbols result in payment of their associated winnings by the machine (or alternatively initiation of a subgame). These games often have many extra features, trails and subgames with opportunities to win money; usually more than can be won from just the payouts on the reel combinations.\n\nFruit machines in the U.K. almost universally have the following features, generally selected at random using a [[pseudorandom number generator]]:\n* A player (known in the industry as a ''punter'') may be given the opportunity to ''hold'' one or more reels before spinning, meaning they will not be spun but instead retain their displayed symbols yet otherwise count normally for that play. This can sometimes increase the chance of winning, especially if two or more reels are held.\n* A player may also be given a number of ''nudges'' following a spin (or, in some machines, as a result in a subgame). A nudge is a step rotation of a reel chosen by the player (the machine may not allow all reels to be nudged for a particular play).\n* ''Cheats'' can also be made available on the Internet or through emailed newsletters to subscribers. These cheats give the player the impression of an advantage, whereas in reality the payout percentage remains exactly the same. The most widely used cheat is known as '''hold after a nudge''' and increases the chance that the player will win following an unsuccessful nudge. The cheats give the player an incentive to play the latest games.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} In reality, whilst machines from the early 1990s did not advertise the concept of '''hold after a nudge''' when this feature was first introduced, it became so well-known amongst players and widespread amongst new machine releases that it is now well-advertised on the machine during play. This is characterized by messages on the display such as ''DON'T HOLD ANY'' or ''LET 'EM SPIN'' and is a designed feature of the machine, not a cheat at all.\n\nIt is known for machines to pay out multiple jackpots, one after the other (this is known as a '''streak''' or '''rave''') but each jackpot requires a new game to be played so as not to violate the law about the maximum payout on a single play. Typically this involves the player only pressing the Start button for which a single credit is taken, regardless of whether this causes the reels to spin or not. The minimum payout percentage is 70%, with pubs often setting the payout at around 78%.\n\n===Japan===\n{{See|Pachinko}}\n\n[[Japan]]ese slot machines, known as {{nihongo|'''pachisuro'''|[[:ja:\u30d1\u30c1\u30b9\u30ed|\u30d1\u30c1\u30b9\u30ed]]}} or '''pachislot''' ([[portmanteau]]s of the words \"pachinko\" and \"slot machine\"), are a descendant of the traditional Japanese [[pachinko]] game. Slot machines are a fairly new phenomenon and they can be found mostly in pachinko parlors and the adult sections of [[Video arcade|amusement arcade]]s, known as game centers.\n\nThe machines are regulated with [[integrated circuit]]s, and have six different levels changing the odds of a [[777 (number)#Gambling and luck|777]]. The levels provide a rough outcome of between 90% to 160% (200% for skilled players). Japanese slot machines are \"beatable\". Parlor operators naturally set most machines to simply collect money, but intentionally place a few paying machines on the floor so that there will be at least someone winning,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} encouraging players on the losing machines to keep gambling, using the psychology of the [[gambler's fallacy]].\n\nDespite the many varieties of pachislot machines, there are certain rules and regulations put forward by the {{nihongo|Security Electronics and Communication Technology Association|[[:ja:\u4fdd\u5b89\u96fb\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u6280\u8853\u5354\u4f1a|\u4fdd\u5b89\u96fb\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u6280\u8853\u5354\u4f1a]]}}, an affiliate of the [[National Police Agency (Japan)|National Police Agency]]. For example, there must be three reels. All reels must be accompanied by buttons which allow players to manually stop them, reels may not spin faster than 80 RPM, and reels must stop within 0.19 seconds of a button press. In practice, this means that machines cannot let reels slip more than 4 symbols. Other rules include a 15 coin payout cap, a 50 credit cap on machines, a 3 coin maximum bet, and other such regulations.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nAlthough a 15 coin payout may seem quite low, regulations allow \"Big Bonus\" (c. 400\u2013711 coins) and \"Regular Bonus\" modes (c. 110 coins) where these 15 coin payouts occur nearly continuously until the bonus mode is finished. While the machine is in bonus mode,  the player is entertained with special winning scenes on the LCD display, and energizing music is heard, payout after payout.\n\nThree other unique features of Pachisuro machines are \"stock\", \"renchan\", and {{Nihongo|''tenj\u014d''|\u5929\u4e95}}. On many machines, when enough money to afford a bonus is taken in, the bonus is not immediately awarded. Typically the game merely stops making the reels slip off the bonus symbols for a few games. If the player fails to hit the bonus during these \"standby games\", it is added to the \"stock\" for later collection. Many current games, after finishing a bonus round, set the probability to release additional stock (gained from earlier players failing to get a bonus last time the machine stopped making the reels slip for a bit) very high for the first few games. As a result, a lucky player may get to play several bonus rounds in a row (a \"renchan\"), making payouts of 5,000 or even 10,000 coins possible. The lure of \"stock\" waiting in the machine, and the possibility of \"renchan\" tease the gambler to keep feeding the machine. To tease them further, there is a ''tenj\u014d'' (ceiling), a maximum limit on the number of games between \"stock\" release. For example, if the ''tenj\u014d'' is 1,500, and the number of games played since the last bonus is 1,490, the player is guaranteed to release a bonus within just 10 games.\n\nBecause of the \"stock\", \"renchan\", and ''tenj\u014d'' systems, it is possible to make money by simply playing machines on which someone has just lost a huge amount of money. This is called being a \"[[hyena]]\". They are easy to recognize, roaming the aisles for a \"kamo\" (\"[[Gullibility|sucker]]\" in English) to leave his machine.\n\nIn short, the regulations allowing \"stock\", \"renchan\", and ''tenj\u014d'' transformed the pachisuro from a low-stakes form of entertainment just a few years back to hardcore gambling. [[Problem gambling|Many people may be gambling more than they can afford]], and the big payouts also lure unsavory \"hyena\" types into the gambling halls.\n\nTo address these social issues, a new regulation (Version 5.0) was adopted in 2006 which caps the maximum amount of \"stock\" a machine can hold to around 2,000\u20133,000 coins' worth of bonus games. Moreover, all pachisuro machines must be re-evaluated for regulation compliance every three years. Version 4.0 came out in 2004, so that means all those machines with the up to 10,000 coin payouts will be removed from service by 2007.\n\n==Problem gambling and slot machines==\nNatasha Dow Sch\u00fcll, associate professor in [[New York University]]'s Department of Media, Culture, and Communication, uses the term \"machine zone\" to describe the state of immersion that users of slot machines experience during gambling, in which they lose a sense of time, space, bodily awareness, and monetary value.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sch\u00fcll|first=Natasha|title=Addiction by Design: Machine Gambling in Las Vegas|location=Princeton, N.J.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0-69-116088-7|oclc=866583433}}</ref>\n\nMike Dixon, PhD, professor of psychology at the [[University of Waterloo]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://uwaterloo.ca/psychology/people-profiles/mike-j-dixon|title=Mike J.

Horse Head Bonus Antique Slot Machine.jpg|thumb|Mills Novelty Co. Horse Head Bonus antique slot machine]]\n\n==Skill stops==\nSkill stop buttons predated the Bally electromechanical slot machines of the 1960s and 70s. They appeared on mechanical slot machines manufactured by Mills Novelty Co. as early as the mid 1920s. These machines had modified reel-stop arms, which allowed them to be released from the timing bar, earlier than in a normal play, simply by pressing the buttons on the front of the machine, located between each reel.\n\n\"Skill stop\" buttons were added to some slot machines by Zacharias Anthony in the early 1970s. These enabled the player to stop each reel, allowing a degree of \"skill\" so as to satisfy the [[New Jersey]] gaming laws of the day which required that players were able to control the game in some way. The original conversion was applied to approximately 50 late-model Bally slot machines. Because the typical machine stopped the reels automatically in less than 10 seconds, weights were added to the mechanical timers to prolong the automatic stopping of the reels. By the time the New Jersey Alcoholic Beverages Commission (ABC) had approved the conversion for use in New Jersey arcades, the word was out and every other distributor began adding skill stops. The machines were a huge hit on the [[Jersey Shore]] and the remaining unconverted Bally machines were destroyed as they had become instantly obsolete.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Casino]]\n*[[EUROMAT|European Gaming & Amusement Federation]]\n*[[List of probability topics]]\n*[[Pachinko]]\n*[[Problem gambling]]\n*[[Progressive jackpot]]\n*[[Quiz machine]]\n*[[United States state slot machine ownership regulations]]\n*[[Video bingo]]\n*[[Video Lottery Terminal]]\n*[[Video poker]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Brisman, Andrew.
