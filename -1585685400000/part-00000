He is best known as the singer of the group [[the Wynners]], and as a solo artist who has been active in the Hong Kong entertainment industry for nearly three decades.\n\n== Career ==\nBee made his break into the Hong Kong entertainment industry in 1973 as a member of the popular 1970s band, [[the Wynners]], sharing vocal duties with [[Alan Tam]]. Before joining the Wynners, he was a vocalist and saxophonist on the Hong Kong nightclub circuit, and briefly fronted a band called ''the Sergeant Majors''.\n\n=== Acting ===\nAs members of the Wynners went separate ways in 1978, Bee embarked on a solo career as an actor in [[Taiwan]], playing lead roles in a number of romantic movies, amongst which were ''[[The Story of a Small Town]]'', (directed by [[Li Hsing]], 1979), ''Good Morning, Taipei'' (directed by Li Hsing, 1979), both of which won the [[Golden Horse Award]], and ''The Green, Green Grass of Home'' (directed by [[Hou Hsiao-hsien]], 1983).\n\nIn the eighties Bee moved his base back to Hong Kong, and has since amassed a large number of movie credits, mainly in the genre of romantic comedies. Career highlights include ''\"Let's Make Laugh\"'' (directed by Alfred Cheung, 1983), ''\"[[Shanghai Blues]]\"'' (directed by [[Tsui Hark]], 1984), ''\"[[Fist of Fury 1991]]\"'' (with [[Stephen Chow]], 1991), ''\"[[the Chinese Feast]]\"'' (directed by [[Tsui Hark]], 1995) and ''\"[[Initial D (film)|Initial D]]\"'' (directed by [[Andrew Lau]] and [[Alan Mak (director)|Alan Mak]], 2005). In addition, he was credited as the director for ''\"100 Ways to Murder Your Wife\"'' (starring himself, [[Chow Yun-fat]] and [[Anita Mui]], 1986).\n\n=== Musicianship ===\nAlongside acting, Bee develops his career as a solo singer-songwriter and has released over fifty studio and compilation albums, in Cantonese, Mandarin and English, to date.  \nThe 1980s marked the peak of Bee's popularity with the Hong Kong audience so far,\nduring which four of his studio albums went gold and two went platinum.<ref>[http://www.ifpihk.org/www_1/go28e.php \"Gold Disc Award\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928011324/http://www.ifpihk.org/www_1/go28e.php |date=28 September 2007 }} International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (Hong Kong Group) Ltd. (IFPI Hong Kong). Retrieved 19 July 2007</ref>\nNotable hits from this period include ''\"''Let Everything Be Gone With the Wind\" (\u8b93\u4e00\u5207\u96a8\u98a8), \"If We Were Meant To Be\" (\u8981\u662f\u6709\u7de3) and \"A Romance\" (\u4e00\u6bb5\u60c5).\n\nKnown for a distinct, husky voice, the singer penned most of his own hits and plays multiple instruments. In the early days he was often seen on stage with keyboards or a saxophone. In recent performances he usually accompanies himself with a guitar.\n\nBee released his latest Cantonese solo album, ''Escape'' (\u6fe4\u51fa\u65b0\u5929), in December 2006, backed by his new band Black Tea.\n\nRecently, Bee partnered with violin luthier [[Scott Cao]] to design their own line of classical guitars, \"Bonstar.\" In 2008, Bee performed a series of solo concerts at the Hong Kong Coliseum, as well as in Singapore and Macau. Aside from working solo, the Wynners continued their world tour.\n\n== Personal life ==\nBee has a blood brother and six half brothers and sisters, with his father a former real estate

he had a son, Nicholas Bee, and a daughter, Chloe Bee. \nThe marriage ended in a high-profile divorce in 1999, feeding tabloids with stories on extramarital affairs, \nexpensive spending habits and financial troubles for many months to come. \nBee filed for [[personal bankruptcy]] in 2002, which expired on 17 October 2006. \nHe is currently living with his second wife Fan Jiang, with whom he has two daughters.\n\nIn December 2007, Bee released an autobiography, ''[[MacDonnell Road]]'', titled after a street in Hong Kong he grew up on.\n\n== Filmography ==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"

Retrieved 19 July 2007</ref>\nNotable hits from this period include ''\"''Let Everything Be Gone With the Wind\" (\u8b93\u4e00\u5207\u96a8\u98a8), \"If We Were Meant To Be\" (\u8981\u662f\u6709\u7de3) and \"A Romance\" (\u4e00\u6bb5\u60c5).\n\nKnown for a distinct, husky voice, the singer penned most of his own hits and plays multiple instruments. In the early days he was often seen on stage with keyboards or a saxophone. In recent performances he usually accompanies himself with a guitar.\n\nBee released his latest Cantonese solo album, ''Escape'' (\u6fe4\u51fa\u65b0\u5929), in December 2006, backed by his new band Black Tea.\n\nRecently, Bee partnered with violin luthier [[Scott Cao]] to design their own line of classical guitars, \"Bonstar.\" In 2008, Bee performed a series of solo concerts at the Hong Kong Coliseum, as well as in Singapore and Macau. Aside from working solo, the Wynners continued their world tour.\n\n== Personal life ==\nBee has a blood brother and six half brothers and sisters, with his father a former real estate agent.<ref>{{YouTube|wX-VMoBcBkk|10-point Hall of Fame \u2013 Kenny Bee (part 1) (Mandarin)}}</ref> He married socialite-turned-actress [[Teresa Cheung (socialite)|Teresa Cheung]] in 1988, with whom he had a son, Nicholas Bee, and a daughter, Chloe Bee. \nThe marriage ended in a high-profile divorce in 1999, feeding tabloids with stories on extramarital affairs, \nexpensive spending habits and financial troubles for many months to come. \nBee filed for [[personal bankruptcy]] in 2002, which expired on 17 October 2006. \nHe is currently living with his second wife Fan Jiang, with whom he has two daughters.\n\nIn December 2007, Bee released an autobiography, ''[[MacDonnell Road]]'', titled after a street in Hong Kong he grew up on.\n\n== Filmography ==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"

Ohlemiller, SFPE Handbook of Fire Protection Engineering (3rd Edition),2002</ref> Many solid materials can sustain a smouldering reaction, including [[coal]], [[cellulose]], [[wood]], [[cotton]], [[tobacco]], [[cannabis]], [[peat]], [[plant litter]], [[humus]], synthetic [[foams]], charring [[polymers]] including [[polyurethane]] foam and some types of [[dust]]. Common examples of smouldering phenomena are the initiation of residential fires on [[upholstered furniture]] by weak heat sources (e.g., a [[cigarette]], a [[Short-circuit|short-circuited wire]]), and the persistent combustion of [[biomass]] behind the flaming front of [[wildfire]]s.<ref>G Rein, Smouldering Combustion Phenomena in Science and Technology, International Review of Chemical Engineering 1, pp. 3-18, 2009 http://hdl.handle.net/1842/2678</ref>\n\n==Fundamentals==\n[[Image:Papierosa 1 ubt 0069.jpeg|thumb|160px|left|A smouldering cigarette.]]\nThe fundamental difference between smouldering and [[flame|flaming]] combustion is that smouldering occurs on the surface of the solid rather than in the gas phase. Smouldering is a surface phenomenon but can propagate to the interior of a [[porous]] fuel if it is permeable to flow. The characteristic [[temperature]] and [[heat]] released during smouldering are low compared to those in the flaming combustion (i.e., ~600 \u00b0C <ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0379711218304661|work=[[Fire Safety Journal]] |doi=10.1016/j.firesaf.2019.04.006 |title=Fire Ember Pyrometry Using a Color Camera (2019)|access-date=2019-10-02|volume=106|year=2019|pages=88\u201393 | last1 = Kim | first1 = Dennis K. | last2 = Sunderland | first2 = Peter B.}} </ref> vs. ~1500 \u00b0C). Smouldering propagates in a creeping fashion, around {{Convert|0.1|mm/s|abbr=on}}, which is about ten times slower than flames spread over a solid. In spite of its weak combustion characteristics, smouldering is a significant fire hazard. Smouldering emits toxic gases (e.g., [[carbon monoxide]]) at a higher yield than flaming fires and leaves behind a significant amount of solid residue. The emitted gases are flammable and could later be ignited in the gas phase, triggering the transition to flaming combustion.<ref>[http://fire.nist.gov/bfrlpubs/fire02/art074.html http://fire.nist.gov/bfrlpubs/fire02/art074.html] \"Smoldering Combustion\" by T.J. Ohlemiller, SFPE Handbook of Fire Protection Engineering (3rd Edition),2002.</ref>\n\n\n==Smouldering materials==\n[[File:Nasa Microgravity Smoldering Combustion experiments.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Polyurethane foam sample from the NASA smouldering experiments.]]\nMany materials can sustain a smouldering reaction, including [[coal fire|coal]], [[tobacco]], decaying [[wood]] and [[sawdust]], [[biomass]] fuels on the forest surface ([[wiktionaryDuff|duff]]) and subsurface ([[peat]]), [[cotton]] clothing and string, and polymeric foams (e.g., [[upholstery]] and [[bedding]] materials). Smouldering fuels are generally porous, permeable to flow and formed by aggregates (particulates, grains, fibres or of cellular structure). These aggregates facilitate the surface reaction with oxygen by allowing gas flow through the fuel and providing a large surface area per unit volume. They also act as thermal insulation, reducing heat losses. The most studied materials to date are [[cellulose]] and [[polyurethane]] foams.\n\n== Threats from smouldering==\nThe characteristics of smouldering fires make them a threat of new dimensions, taking the form of colossal underground fires or silent fire safety risks, as summarized below.\n\n*[[Image:TOMS indonesia smog lrg.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Smoke and pollution from fires in Borneo, 1997.]] [[Fire safety]]: The main hazards posed by smouldering arise from the fact that it can be easily initiated (by heat sources too weak to ignite flames) and is difficult to detect. Fire statistics draw attention to the magnitude of smouldering combustion as the leading cause of fire deaths in residential areas (i.e., more than 25% of the fire deaths in the [[United States]] are attributed to smoulder-initiated fires, with similar figures in other developed countries). A particularly common fire scenario is a [[cigarette]] igniting a piece of [[upholstery|upholstered furniture]]. This ignition leads to a smouldering fire that lasts for a long period of time (in the order of hours), spreading slowly and silently until critical conditions are attained and flames suddenly erupt;<ref>J. R. Hall, 2004, The Smoking-Material Fire Problem, Fire Analysis and Research Division of The National Fire Protection Association, Quincy, MA (USA). November 2004.</ref> [[fire safe cigarettes|fire-resistant cigarettes]] have been developed to reduce the risk of fire due to smouldering. Smouldering combustion is also a fire-safety concern aboard space facilities (e.g., [[International Space Station]]), because the [[microgravity|absence of gravity]] is thought to promote smouldering ignition and propagation.\n*[[Image:WTCgroundzero.jpg|thumb|right|320px|The smouldering pile of debris after the [[September 11 attacks]], Manhattan, New York.]] [[Wildfire]]s: Smouldering combustion of the forest ground does not have the visual impact of flaming combustion; however, it has important consequences for the [[forest]] ecosystem. Smouldering of [[biomass]] can linger for days or weeks after flaming has ceased, resulting in large quantities of fuels consumed and becoming a global source of [[exhaust gas|emission]]s to the atmosphere.<ref>I.T. Bertschi, R.J. Yokelson, D.E. Ward, R.E. Babbitt, R.A. Susott, J.G. Goode, W.M.

Subsurface fires in [[Coal mine fire|coal mines]], [[Peat#Fires|peat lands]] and landfills are rare events, but when active they can smoulder for very long periods of time (months or years), emitting enormous quantities of combustion gases into the atmosphere, causing deterioration of [[air quality]] and subsequent health problems.

Common examples of smouldering phenomena are the initiation of residential fires on [[upholstered furniture]] by weak heat sources (e.g., a [[cigarette]], a [[Short-circuit|short-circuited wire]]), and the persistent combustion of [[biomass]] behind the flaming front of [[wildfire]]s.<ref>G Rein, Smouldering Combustion Phenomena in Science and Technology, International Review of Chemical Engineering 1, pp. 3-18, 2009 http://hdl.handle.net/1842/2678</ref>\n\n==Fundamentals==\n[[Image:Papierosa 1 ubt 0069.jpeg|thumb|160px|left|A smouldering cigarette.]]\nThe fundamental difference between smouldering and [[flame|flaming]] combustion is that smouldering occurs on the surface of the solid rather than in the gas phase. Smouldering is a surface phenomenon but can propagate to the interior of a [[porous]] fuel if it is permeable to flow. The characteristic [[temperature]] and [[heat]] released during smouldering are low compared to those in the flaming combustion (i.e., ~600 \u00b0C <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0379711218304661|work=[[Fire Safety Journal]] D.K. Kim, [[Peter B. Sunderland|P.B. Sunderland]] |title=Fire Ember Pyrometry Using a Color Camera (2019)|access-date=2019-10-02}} </ref> vs. ~1500 \u00b0C). Smouldering propagates in a creeping fashion, around {{Convert|0.1|mm/s|abbr=on}}, which is about ten times slower than flames spread over a solid. In spite of its weak combustion characteristics, smouldering is a significant fire hazard. Smouldering emits toxic gases (e.g., [[carbon monoxide]]) at a higher yield than flaming fires and leaves behind a significant amount of solid residue. The emitted gases are flammable and could later be ignited in the gas phase, triggering the transition to flaming combustion.<ref>[http://fire.nist.gov/bfrlpubs/fire02/art074.html http://fire.nist.gov/bfrlpubs/fire02/art074.html] \"Smoldering Combustion\" by T.J.

Smouldering fuels are generally porous, permeable to flow and formed by aggregates (particulates, grains, fibres or of cellular structure). These aggregates facilitate the surface reaction with oxygen by allowing gas flow through the fuel and providing a large surface area per unit volume. They also act as thermal insulation, reducing heat losses. The most studied materials to date are [[cellulose]] and [[polyurethane]] foams.\n\n== Threats from smouldering==\nThe characteristics of smouldering fires make them a threat of new dimensions, taking the form of colossal underground fires or silent fire safety risks, as summarized below.\n\n*[[Image:TOMS indonesia smog lrg.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Smoke and pollution from fires in Borneo, 1997.]] [[Fire safety]]: The main hazards posed by smouldering arise from the fact that it can be easily initiated (by heat sources too weak to ignite flames) and is difficult to detect. Fire statistics draw attention to the magnitude of smouldering combustion as the leading cause of fire deaths in residential areas (i.e., more than 25% of the fire deaths in the [[United States]] are attributed to smoulder-initiated fires, with similar figures in other developed countries). A particularly common fire scenario is a [[cigarette]] igniting a piece of [[upholstery|upholstered furniture]]. This ignition leads to a smouldering fire that lasts for a long period of time (in the order of hours), spreading slowly and silently until critical conditions are attained and flames suddenly erupt;<ref>J. R. Hall, 2004, The Smoking-Material Fire Problem, Fire Analysis and Research Division of The National Fire Protection Association, Quincy, MA (USA). November 2004.</ref> [[fire safe cigarettes|fire-resistant cigarettes]] have been developed to reduce the risk of fire due to smouldering. Smouldering combustion is also a fire-safety concern aboard space facilities (e.g., [[International Space Station]]), because the [[microgravity|absence of gravity]] is thought to promote smouldering ignition and propagation.\n*[[Image:WTCgroundzero.jpg|thumb|right|320px|The smouldering pile of debris after the [[September 11 attacks]], Manhattan, New York.]] [[Wildfire]]s: Smouldering combustion of the forest ground does not have the visual impact of flaming combustion; however, it has important consequences for the [[forest]] ecosystem.

Our brain has folds in the [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] to increase surface area called [[Gyrus|gyri]] and patients with polymicrogyri have an increase number of folds and smaller folds than usual.<ref>\"Bilateral Frontoparietal Polymicrogyria (BFPP).\" Welcome to the Research View. N.p., n.d. Web. 05 Nov. 2012. <http://www.neuroscienceandgenetics.it/syndrome/bilateral-frontoparietal-polymicrogyria-bfpp>.</ref> Polymicrogyria is defined as a cerebral malformation of cortical development in which the normal gyral pattern of the surface of the brain is replaced by an excessive number of small, fused gyri separated by shallow [[Sulcus (neuroanatomy)|sulci]] and abnormal cortical lamination. From ongoing research, mutation in GPR56, a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, results in BFPP. These mutations are located in different regions of the protein without any evidence of a relationship between the position of the mutation and phenotypic severity.<ref>Bahi-Buisson, N., K.

Disruptions of cerebral cortical development due to abnormal neuronal migration and positioning usually lead to cortical disorders, which includes '''cobblestone lissencephaly'''. Cobblestone lissencephaly is typically seen in three different human congenital muscular dystrophy syndromes:  '''[[Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy]]''', '''[[Walker-Warburg syndrome]]''', and '''muscle-eye-brain disease'''.<ref>Lin, Dr. Hsi-Hsien. Personal Interview. 29 October 2012.</ref>   In cobblestone lissencephaly, the brain surface actually has a bumpy contour caused by the presence of collections of misplaced neurons and [[glial cell]]s that have migrated beyond the normal surface boundaries of the brain. Sometimes regions populated by these misplaced cells have caused a radiologic misdiagnosis of polymicrogyria. However, the presence of other abnormalities in these cobblestone lissencephaly syndromes, including ocular anomalies, congenital muscular dystrophy, [[ventriculomegaly]], and cerebellar dysplasia, usually distinguishes these disorders from polymicrogyria.<ref name=\"chang\"/> There are no anatomopathologic studies that have characterized the pattern of cortical laminar alterations in patients with GPR56 gene mutations, but it has been suggested that the imaging characteristics of BFPP, including [[myelination]] defects and cerebellar cortical [[dysplasia]], are reminiscent of those of the so-called cobblestone malformations (muscle-eye-brain disease and Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy) that are also associated with N-glycosylation defects in the developing brain.<ref>Parrini, Elena, Anna Rita Ferrari, Thomas Dorn, Christopher A. Walsh, and Renzo Guerrini. \"Bilateral Frontoparietal Polymicrogyria, Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome, Andgene Mutations.\" Epilepsia 50.6 (2009): 1344-353. Print.</ref>\n\n'''Lissencephaly''' (\"smooth brain\") is the extreme form of pachygyria. In lissencephaly, few or no sulci are seen on the cortical surface, resulting in a broad, smooth appearance to the entire brain. Lissencephaly can be radiologically confused with polymicrogyria, particularly with low-resolution imaging, but the smoothness and lack of irregularity in the gray-white junction, along with markedly increased cortical thickness, distinguishes lissencephaly.\n\nGPR56 mutation also can cause a severe encelphalopathy which is associated with electro clinical features of the '''Lennox-Gastaut syndrome'''. [[Lennox-Gastaut syndrome]] can be cryptogenic or symptomatic, but the symptomatic forms have been associated with multiple etiologies and abnormal cortical development. BFPP caused by GPR56 mutations is a representation of a malformation of cortical development that causes Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome.<ref>Parriniy, E., Ferrariz A.R., Dorn T., Walsh C.A., Guerrini, R., Bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and GPR56 gene mutations, Epilepsia, Volume 50 Issue 6, Pages 1344\u20131353, 2009.</ref>\n\nPolymicrogyria usually gets misdiagnose with pacygyria so therefore it needs to be distinguished from pachygyria.  '''[[Pachygyria]]''' is a distinct brain malformation in which the surface folds are excessively broad and sparse. Pachygyria and polymicrogyria may look similar on low-resolution neuroimaging such as CT because the cortical thickness can appear to be increased and the gyri can appear to be broad and smooth in both conditions. This is why higher resolution neuroimaging are needed such as an MRI.<ref name=\"chang\"/>\n\n[[File:Lissencephaly.png|thumb|left|Lissencephaly:Brain MRI, T1 weighted, transverse plane, that shows lyssencephaly, manifested as scarce and wide circumvolutions, mostly in the occipital, parietal and temporal lobes.

Our brain has folds in the [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] to increase surface area called [[Gyrus|gyri]] and patients with polymicrogyri have an increase number of folds and smaller folds than usual.<ref>\"Bilateral Frontoparietal Polymicrogyria (BFPP).\" Welcome to the Research View. N.p., n.d. Web. 05 Nov. 2012. <http://www.neuroscienceandgenetics.it/syndrome/bilateral-frontoparietal-polymicrogyria-bfpp>.</ref> Polymicrogyria is defined as a cerebral malformation of cortical development in which the normal gyral pattern of the surface of the brain is replaced by an excessive number of small, fused gyri separated by shallow [[Sulcus (neuroanatomy)|sulci]] and abnormal cortical lamination. From ongoing research, mutation in GPR56, a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, results in BFPP. These mutations are located in different regions of the protein without any evidence of a relationship between the position of the mutation and phenotypic severity.<ref>Bahi-Buisson, N., K.

Disruptions of cerebral cortical development due to abnormal neuronal migration and positioning usually lead to cortical disorders, which includes '''cobblestone lissencephaly'''. Cobblestone lissencephaly is typically seen in three different human congenital muscular dystrophy syndromes:  '''[[Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy]]''', '''[[Walker-Warburg syndrome]]''', and '''muscle-eye-brain disease'''.<ref>Lin, Dr. Hsi-Hsien. Personal Interview. 29 October 2012.</ref>   In cobblestone lissencephaly, the brain surface actually has a bumpy contour caused by the presence of collections of misplaced neurons and [[glial cell]]s that have migrated beyond the normal surface boundaries of the brain. Sometimes regions populated by these misplaced cells have caused a radiologic misdiagnosis of polymicrogyria. However, the presence of other abnormalities in these cobblestone lissencephaly syndromes, including ocular anomalies, congenital muscular dystrophy, [[ventriculomegaly]], and cerebellar dysplasia, usually distinguishes these disorders from polymicrogyria.<ref name=\"chang\"/> There are no anatomopathologic studies that have characterized the pattern of cortical laminar alterations in patients with GPR56 gene mutations, but it has been suggested that the imaging characteristics of BFPP, including [[myelination]] defects and cerebellar cortical [[dysplasia]], are reminiscent of those of the so-called cobblestone malformations (muscle-eye-brain disease and Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy) that are also associated with N-glycosylation defects in the developing brain.<ref>Parrini, Elena, Anna Rita Ferrari, Thomas Dorn, Christopher A. Walsh, and Renzo Guerrini. \"Bilateral Frontoparietal Polymicrogyria, Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome, Andgene Mutations.\" Epilepsia 50.6 (2009): 1344-353. Print.</ref>\n\n'''Lissencephaly''' (\"smooth brain\") is the extreme form of pachygyria. In lissencephaly, few or no sulci are seen on the cortical surface, resulting in a broad, smooth appearance to the entire brain. Lissencephaly can be radiologically confused with polymicrogyria, particularly with low-resolution imaging, but the smoothness and lack of irregularity in the gray-white junction, along with markedly increased cortical thickness, distinguishes lissencephaly.\n\nGPR56 mutation also can cause a severe encelphalopathy which is associated with electro clinical features of the '''Lennox-Gastaut syndrome'''. [[Lennox-Gastaut syndrome]] can be cryptogenic or symptomatic, but the symptomatic forms have been associated with multiple etiologies and abnormal cortical development. BFPP caused by GPR56 mutations is a representation of a malformation of cortical development that causes Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome.<ref>Parriniy, E., Ferrariz A.R., Dorn T., Walsh C.A., Guerrini, R., Bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and GPR56 gene mutations, Epilepsia, Volume 50 Issue 6, Pages 1344\u20131353, 2009.</ref>\n\nPolymicrogyria usually gets misdiagnose with pacygyria so therefore it needs to be distinguished from pachygyria.  '''[[Pachygyria]]''' is a distinct brain malformation in which the surface folds are excessively broad and sparse. Pachygyria and polymicrogyria may look similar on low-resolution neuroimaging such as CT because the cortical thickness can appear to be increased and the gyri can appear to be broad and smooth in both conditions. This is why higher resolution neuroimaging are needed such as an MRI.<ref name=\"chang\"/>\n\n[[File:Lissencephaly.png|thumb|left|Lissencephaly:Brain MRI, T1 weighted, transverse plane, that shows lyssencephaly, manifested as scarce and wide circumvolutions, mostly in the occipital, parietal and temporal lobes.

This GPCR group have long N termini characterized by an extracellular \u201ccysteine box\u201d and hydrophilic, potentially [[mucin]]-rich.

Some DSAP cases have been reported in patients with acute immune compromised situations, particularly in the elderly.  For those with sun damaged skin, the lesions usually begin to appear in the patient's 20s and increase in number and visibility in the 40s or 50s.  Commonly, though not always, the number and visibility of lesions is in direct proportion to the amount of sun damage to the affected area.\n\nLesions generally are characterized by an irregularly shaped thread-like ring that is usually the size of a pencil eraser, though lesions vary and may be half or double that size.  The thread-like ring is very thin, much like fabric thread for sewing, and raised such that it is both palpable and visible.  The interior of the ring may be rough like sandpaper, or smooth.  The interior is often discolored, though colors vary from patient to patient. Lesions, due to their vascular nature, can also vary according to body temperature, environmental temperatures, and other external stimuli.  The internal ring color is most often reddish, purplish, pink, or brown.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.groups.yahoo.com/group/dsapskin | title=Yahoo!

The MMA combines the military medical services of the country in their entirety with several hospitals in the capital Sofia and around the country. At the same time it is one of the country's leading medical institutions and possesses large medical treatment capacity and know-how.

The Council is chaired by Professor [[Kosta Kostov]], a leading pulmonary disease expert. The Council's mission is to provide the government with complementary analysis and action proposals and the general public with professional guidance and information.
