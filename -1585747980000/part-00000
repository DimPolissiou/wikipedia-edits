Ethel Hallow makes a good first impression on the teachers. Mildred helps Maud, whose glasses were broken in the crash, get to school, but they both crash-land in the pond. They tell Miss Hardbroom that Mildred was supposed to attend Pentangle's, but decided that Cackle's is better. Esmerelda Hallow, Ethel's older sister, gives the students a tour and Miss Cackle helps Mildred cope with the effects of a transfer spell. Mildred and Maud sneak off to look at the kittens and Ethel eavesdrops on them discussing how Mildred is not from a magical family. They lose a kitten, but find it in the kitchens. Later, Mildred struggles with the written exam. Miss Cackle encourages her to do what she is good at, but she only manages to get 1%, due to filling her paper with drawings instead of answers, as her best subject is art. Miss Cackle's twin sister, Agatha, turns up, and Miss Cackle gives her permission to speak to Miss Hardbroom for an internet article. The students make their potions and Mildred successfully manages to levitate, after taking some of Ethel's pondweed from her dragon potion (due to Ethel having taken all of it), making Ethel wrongly turn into a worm.\n\n''First appearances'': [[Bella Ramsey]] as [[Mildred Hubble]], Meibh Campbell as Maud Spellbody, Jenny Richardson as [[Ethel Hallow]], Miriam Petche as Esmerelda Hallow, Tallulah Milligan as [[Drusilla Paddock]], Dagny Rollins as Felicity Foxglove, [[Clare Higgins]] as Miss Ada Cackle/Agatha Cackle, [[Raquel Cassidy]] as Miss Hecate Hardbroom, [[Wendy Craig]] as Miss Bat, [[Shauna Shim]] as Miss Drill, [[Kacey Ainsworth]] as Miss Gullet, [[Zita Sattar]] as Miss Tapioca and [[Nicola Stephenson]] as Julie Hubble\n\n''Note'': Episode 1 and 2 aired in a 1 hour episode.\n|LineColor       = 69AFFF\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Worst Witch (2017 TV series)\n|EpisodeNumber   = 3\n|EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n|Title           = Tabby\n|DirectedBy      = Brian Grant\n|WrittenBy       = Emma Reeves\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|1|18|df=y}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/cbbc/status/819213818|title=CBBC (@cbbc) - Twitter|website=twitter.com}}{{dead link|date=January 2018|fix-attempted=yes|bot=TweetCiteBot}}</ref>\n|Viewers         = 0.334\n|ShortSummary    = On their first day, Mildred's phone is confiscated by Miss Hardbroom.

Miss Hardbroom decides to arrange a flying test for the class and Ethel tells Esmerelda she will help Mildred. When Mildred tries to train Tabby, Ethel offers to help and pours a bit of sardine juice on the broom tail.

She later reassures Miss Cackle and Mildred and Maud successfully disenchant Felicity, Miss Mould and Ethel and Ethel is angry with Mildred upon her return to school when she sees Esmerelda leaves with their dad.\n|LineColor       = #00BB00\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Worst Witch (2017 TV series)\n|EpisodeNumber   = 21\n|EpisodeNumber2  = 8\n|Title           = Miss Cackle's Birthday\n|RTitle          = \n|DirectedBy      = Dermot Boyd\n|WrittenBy       = Matt Evans\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|2|26|df=y}}\n|Viewers         = 0.298\n|ShortSummary    = Maud is acting as director for Miss Cackle's show for her birthday, but Maud is miserable when her best act is not that good. When Sybil, Clarice and Bea practise their broom dance, Ethel has a go at Sybil and Miss Hardbroom shows Miss Cackle a newspaper article about the recent failings at Cackles. Miss Hardbroom magics the second year to the potion lab when they spend their lesson practising for their show and when Maud contemplates resigning as director, Mildred and Enid work on a happiness potion for Maud and when she takes it, Maud turns into a baby, the last time she was happy. Miss Hardbroom cancels potions class when Miss Cackle frets about the mistakes and believes she should quit; she also appoints Ethel as director in place of Maud. When baby Maud causes a mess, Miss Bat takes her when Enid tidies up and Ethel decides that the show will be an instrumentless orchestra instead of individual acts. Enid discovers baby Maud is in the potions lab when she magically transports herself to the pond and everyone walks out from the orchestra. Mildred confesses to Miss Cackle about Maud and when she summons Enid and baby Maud, she changes Maud back. At the show, Ethel's solo ocherstra fails to impress, so Mildred gets Sybil, Clarice and Bea to perform their broom dance, Felicity to dance and she, Maud and Enid perform a sketch as Miss Hardbroom, Miss Cackle and Miss Drill as well as performing the school song.

Mildred eavesdrops outside the staff room, where she overhears Miss Hardbroom telling the staff Miss Cackle has been summoned to a disciplinary hearing at the magic council and the school is being inspected by Miss Doomstone later that day. Mildred tells Maud and Enid and when Miss Bat falls asleep while covering potions class, Mildred, Maud and Enid sneak off to the magic council to show support for Miss Cackle. In the first years potion class, Miss Hardbroom upsets Sybil when she makes a mistake with her colour changing potion, causing her cauldron to explode, so Bea decides to make a personality changing potion for Miss Hardbroom. Mildred, Maud and Enid gain access into the magic council ground and hide as The Great Wizard points out Miss Cackle's failings. Bea gives Miss Hardbroom the potion, which works when Bea suggests the class have fun and Miss Hardbroom makes jokes at Ethel and Felicity. Mrs Hallow blames Miss Cackle for Esmerelda losing her powers while Miss Hardbroom lets the class sing their potion recipes as well as dismissing them early. Mrs Hallow presents a petition for parents asking Miss Cackle to be removed as headmistress and Mildred, Maud and Enid emerge, asking if they can speak in Miss Cackle's defence, which Mildred does. Sybil, Clarice and Bea work on an antidote, but Miss Hardbroom refuses to take it and after being held up, Miss Doomstone arrives to see Miss Hardbroom, but slips on frog gloop. Miss Doomstone is given a personality changing potion as Miss Hardbroom takes the antidote and Miss Doomstone informs everyone she has recommended that the school stays open.

Mildred, Maud and Enid are upset about the prospect of all going to different schools as Maud's parents are visiting Miss Amulet's Academy and Miss Cackle continues to look at the petition. Miss Pentangle is summoned to Miss Cackle's office and admits she has been asked to be headmistress at Cackles as well as Pentangles. Miss Pentangle impresses the first years with her modern chanting and gives Mildred a power boost in order to perform an invisibility spell in potions. Sybil faints in chanting after performing a chant with confidence and Mildred confides in Miss Pentangle over wanting to get Miss Cackle reinstated. Mildred sneaks off to Miss Cackle's office during chanting to see the petition when her classmates say their parents never signed and Miss Pentangle watches Miss Cackle help Sybil with her spells and potions when she becomes emotional after struggling. With Maud and Enid's help, Mildred makes a true author potion when Maud and Enid's signatures are on the petition and when they attempt to show Miss Hardbroom, Mildred burns the scroll as her powers are strong. The Great Wizard arrives at Cackles and Mildred tells him she believes the petition signatures are forged, so using the mists of time, they find out Mrs Hallow forged the signatures. Mrs Hallow is magicked to the school and Ethel is hurt that Mrs Hallow did it out of revenge for Esmerelda and she is sacked from the council while Miss Cackle is reinstated.\n\n''Guest Starring'': Miss Pentangle\n\n|LineColor       = #00BB00\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Worst Witch (2017 TV series)\n|EpisodeNumber   = 24\n|EpisodeNumber2  = 11\n|Title           = Love at First Sight\n|RTitle          = \n|DirectedBy      = Delyth Thomas\n|WrittenBy       = Claire Miller\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|3|19|df=y}}\n|Viewers         = 0.277\n|ShortSummary    = On Halloween, Mildred scares Maud and Enid and with Clarice and Bea, Sybil tells them about a ghoul in one of the turrets. The next day, an emotion potion made by Mildred, Maud and Enid ends up in the drinks of all the staff when it was just intended for Miss Bat to help her and Mr Rowan-Webb make up. The potion works on Miss Mould when she begins to fall for Mr Rowan-Webb and Ethel presents Esmerelda with the school founding stone to help get her powers back. Mildred, Maud, Enid and Felicity realise they have to keep Mr Rowan-Webb away from the teachers and Ethel tells Esmerelda that the founding stone that was returned was a clone made by her. Miss Hardbroom begins to fall for Mr Rowan-Webb when Enid fails to distract her away from him, as does Miss Drill whilst Ethel explains how she cloned the stone, but Esmerelda refuses to take the powers. Miss Bat makes amends with him when the potion begins to work on her and Mr Rowan-Webb falls for himself upon seeing his reflection, so Mildred and Maud get him into a classroom by using his reflection. Esmerelda takes Mildred up on her offer on advice on normal schools, giving Ethel the importunity to put in place a spell to trap Esmerelda in her room with the founding stone. Maud fails to keep the staff away from Mr Rowan-Webb, but Mildred is able to warn Miss Cackle about the situation in time for her to negate the spell. Sybil goes into Ethel's room and is scared to be trapped in and Esmerelda is annoyed that Ethel's kindness towards her is to gain their mum's approval. Esmerelda is forced to gain powers from the stone when Sybil has climbed out of the roof and on the verge of falling, which delights Ethel, but the stone dies.\n|LineColor       = #00BB00\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Worst Witch (2017 TV series)\n|EpisodeNumber   = 25 <hr />26\n|EpisodeNumber2  = 12 <hr />13\n|Title           = All Hallow's Eve\n|AltTitle        = The Big Freeze\n|DirectedBy      = Delyth Thomas\n|WrittenBy       = Neil Jones\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|3|26|df=y}}\n|Viewers         = 0.414\n|ShortSummary    = (All Hallow's Eve) Esmerelda attempts to give the powers back to the stone, but fails. Miss Cackle allows the pupils to play magical tricks on the staff without fear on Halloween. Esmerelda and Sybil recall a bedtime story from when they were younger about one of their ancestors reigniting her coven's stone, so using the Hallow family tree, Mildred asks for the Hallow responsible for that to come forward and tell them what to do, but they fly away. Miss Hardbroom struggles to get Miss Mould's references from the school she used to teach at while Mildred, Maud, Enid and Ethel try to get the answers out the Hallow ancestors. When they find the Hallow who reignited the stone, the Hallow tells them she just took credit for it. Clarice and Beatrice are convinced the magic in the school has gone haywire and eventually Esmerelda and Sybil are forced to admit that Esmerelda has got her magic back by taking it from the Stone. When Miss Drill notices the school is freezing, Miss Cackle evacuates the school, but she, Miss Hardbroom, Maud, Enid and Felicity are trapped in the potions lab. Mildred returns to the family trees to get answers from the Hallows and the witch who actually reignited the Stone long ago emerges, who turns out to be Mildred's ancestor, Mirabelle Hubble. \n\n(The Big Freeze) Mirabelle explains that she had to sacrifice her magic as well as 12 descendants' magic to save the stone, and Mildred is her 13th descendant, the first magical Hubble for centuries. Mildred is delighted to find out that she is from a witching family after all. Whilst Mildred's mum Julie is in the park, she is told by her miniature self to go to Cackle's. In the potions lab, Felicity is suspended in a block of ice, so Miss Cackle, Maud and Enid give the rest of their magic to Miss Hardbroom to help Mildred, putting them into ice blocks. Mildred is unhappy about leaving the school, but Miss Mould tells her about a coven Mildred could go to, where she could be individual and creative. When Miss Hardbroom gets outside, it turns out that the founding stone is still in the school and the coven Miss Mould knows off is run by Agatha. Miss Mould's plan was to allow Agatha to escape the photograph once the Stone's magic failed. Mildred praises Miss Mould as a teacher before she is frozen herself. Ethel decides to sacrifice her magic to the stone, but she is too late as when she makes a speech, Miss Hardbroom, Esmerelda and Sybil are put into ice blocks, and then she is. Julie Hubble arrives at the school and gets Mildred out of her block; Mildred explains to her mum about their ancestor. Mildred decides to sacrifice her powers to the stone, but although she starts the process, Miss Mould, moved by what Mildred said to her, completes the ritual in her place and reignites the stone, losing her powers. The school is saved and later celebrates Halloween.\n|LineColor       = #00BB00\n}}\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n===Series 3 (2019)===\n<onlyinclude>{{Episode table |background=#FF36FF |overall=6 |series=6 |title=30 |director=14 |writer=20 |airdate=14 |viewers=10 |country=UK | viewersR=<ref name=\"BARB2\">[https://www.barb.co.uk/viewing-data/four-screen-dashboard/ Weekly top programmes on four screens (from Sept 2018)] Broadcasters' Audience Research Board (BARB)</ref> |episodes=\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Worst Witch (2017 TV series)\n|EpisodeNumber   = 27\n|EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n|Title           = The Wishing Star\n|DirectedBy      = Dirk Campbell\n|WrittenBy       = Neil Jones\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|1|7|df=y}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/schedules/p00fzl9r/2019/01/07|title=BBC TV Guide|website=bbc.co.uk|access-date=9 January 2019}}</ref>\n|Viewers         = 0.279\n|ShortSummary    = Mildred enters the Great Wizard\u2019s broomstick-flying contest to win a Wishing Star so she can wish her Mum magical, but trouble arises when she competes with her new stray dog rather than Tabby.

When Mildred and Ethel insult each other, Miss Cackle leaves an orange handprint on their backs. Whilst the students observe the founding stone, Mildred and Ethel find out about the handprint when Ethel temporarily turns Mildred into stone. After surveying a package outside, Miss Bat opens it, which turns out to be stone, but later, eyes appear. Mildred and Ethel become joined together by the arm, which Miss Cackle reveals is a friendship trap that will only undo when they make friends and Sybil refuses to leave her room after recent events.

Bea admits she is not asthmatic, but allergic to cats and Ollie tells Mildred, Maud and Enid that the magic he wants to learn is not taught at wizard school. He also tells them he would like to meet Esper Vespertilio due to his liking of chanting and Bea uses a vanishing potion to get rid of asthhma, but she accidentally makes her cat Solstice disappear.

The next day, an emotion potion made by Mildred, Maud and Enid ends up in the drinks of all the staff when it was just intended for Miss Bat to help her and Mr Rowan-Webb make up. The potion works on Miss Mould when she begins to fall for Mr Rowan-Webb and Ethel presents Esmerelda with the school founding stone to help get her powers back. Mildred, Maud, Enid and Felicity realise they have to keep Mr Rowan-Webb away from the teachers and Ethel tells Esmerelda that the founding stone that was returned was a clone made by her. Miss Hardbroom begins to fall for Mr Rowan-Webb when Enid fails to distract her away from him, as does Miss Drill whilst Ethel explains how she cloned the stone, but Esmerelda refuses to take the powers.

Miss Cackle allows the pupils to play magical tricks on the staff without fear on Halloween. Esmerelda and Sybil recall a bedtime story from when they were younger about one of their ancestors reigniting her coven's stone, so using the Hallow family tree, Mildred asks for the Hallow responsible for that to come forward and tell them what to do, but they fly away. Miss Hardbroom struggles to get Miss Mould's references from the school she used to teach at while Mildred, Maud, Enid and Ethel try to get the answers out the Hallow ancestors. When they find the Hallow who reignited the stone, the Hallow tells them she just took credit for it. Clarice and Beatrice are convinced the magic in the school has gone haywire and eventually Esmerelda and Sybil are forced to admit that Esmerelda has got her magic back by taking it from the Stone. When Miss Drill notices the school is freezing, Miss Cackle evacuates the school, but she, Miss Hardbroom, Maud, Enid and Felicity are trapped in the potions lab. Mildred returns to the family trees to get answers from the Hallows and the witch who actually reignited the Stone long ago emerges, who turns out to be Mildred's ancestor, Mirabelle Hubble. \n\n(The Big Freeze) Mirabelle explains that she had to sacrifice her magic as well as 12 descendants' magic to save the stone, and Mildred is her 13th descendant, the first magical Hubble for centuries. Mildred is delighted to find out that she is from a witching family after all. Whilst Mildred's mum Julie is in the park, she is told by her miniature self to go to Cackle's. In the potions lab, Felicity is suspended in a block of ice, so Miss Cackle, Maud and Enid give the rest of their magic to Miss Hardbroom to help Mildred, putting them into ice blocks. Mildred is unhappy about leaving the school, but Miss Mould tells her about a coven Mildred could go to, where she could be individual and creative. When Miss Hardbroom gets outside, it turns out that the founding stone is still in the school and the coven Miss Mould knows off is run by Agatha. Miss Mould's plan was to allow Agatha to escape the photograph once the Stone's magic failed. Mildred praises Miss Mould as a teacher before she is frozen herself. Ethel decides to sacrifice her magic to the stone, but she is too late as when she makes a speech, Miss Hardbroom, Esmerelda and Sybil are put into ice blocks, and then she is. Julie Hubble arrives at the school and gets Mildred out of her block; Mildred explains to her mum about their ancestor. Mildred decides to sacrifice her powers to the stone, but although she starts the process, Miss Mould, moved by what Mildred said to her, completes the ritual in her place and reignites the stone, losing her powers.

The company is a unit of the [[Canal+ Group]], owned by [[Vivendi]].\n\n==Background==\nThe company was founded in 1988 by [[Pierre Lescure]] as a spin-off of the [[Canal+]] pay-TV network. The original function was to focus on French and [[Europe]]an productions, but later made strategic deals with American production companies. StudioCanal's most notable productions from its early years include the original [[Rambo (franchise)|Rambo]] trilogy, ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'', ''[[Basic Instinct]]'', ''[[Cliffhanger (film)|Cliffhanger]]'', ''[[Under Siege]]'', ''[[Free Willy]]'', ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'', the original ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'' movie and the [[Kill Bill]] films. In those days, it was known as Le Studio Canal+.\n\nOther films the company financed include ''[[U-571 (film)|U-571]]'', ''[[Bully (2001 film)|Bully]]'', and ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary (film)|Bridget Jones's Diary]]''. StudioCanal also funded the last third of [[David Lynch]]'s film ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]''.<ref>{{IMDb title|166924|Mulholland Drive}}</ref> StudioCanal also financed French-language films, such as ''[[Brotherhood of the Wolf]]'' (which became the second-highest-grossing [[French-language]] film in the [[United States]] in the last two decades) and ''[[Intimate Strangers (2004 film)|Intimate Strangers]]'' (which is being remade by Hollywood-based [[Paramount Pictures]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117967389.html?categoryid=2607&cs=1|publisher=Variety|first=Matthew|last=Ross|title=Kelly Fremon|date=June 21, 2007}}</ref>). The biggest box office hits for StudioCanal have been ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day'' which grossed US$519 million, ''Basic Instinct'' which grossed US$352 million and ''[[The Tourist (2010 film)|The Tourist]]'' which grossed US$278 million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=terminator2.htm|title=Terminator 2: Judgment Day|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=basicinstinct.htm|title=Basic Instinct|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=tourist.htm|title=The Tourist|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Film library==\nStudioCanal acquired film libraries from studios that either became defunct or had merged with it over the years; as a result, the company's library is one of the largest in the world, with over 6,000 titles.\n\nStudioCanal owns the libraries of the following companies:\n* [[Carolco Pictures]],<ref name=carolco1>{{cite web|last=Lambie|first=Ryan|title=The rise and fall of Carolco|date=March 11, 2014|publisher=[[Den of Geek]]|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/carolco/233689/the-rise-and-fall-of-carolco|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref><ref name=carolco2>{{cite web|last=Lambie|first=Ryan|title=Exclusive: CEO Alex Bafer Tells Us About The Return of Carolco|date=January 26, 2015|publisher=[[Den of Geek]]|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/carolco/243077/exclusive-ceo-alex-bafer-tells-us-about-the-return-of-carolco|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref> including:\n**The Vista Organization\n**Seven Arts (joint venture with [[New Line Cinema]])\n*Paravision International, including:\n** Parafrance Films\n** [[De Laurentiis Entertainment Group]],<ref name=carolco1/><ref name=carolco2/><ref name=deg>{{cite web|last=Hammer|first=Joshua|title=Total Free Fall|date=March 8, 1992|work=[[Newsweek]]|url=http://www.newsweek.com/total-free-fall-195938|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref> including:\n*** [[Embassy Pictures]]<ref name=carolco1/><ref name=carolco2/><ref name=deg/><ref>{{cite web|last=Friendly|first=David T.|title=De Laurentiis Rejoins The Ranks--at Embassy|date=November 16, 1985|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1985-11-16/entertainment/ca-2810_1_major-studios|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref>\n* Lumiere Pictures and Television<ref>{{cite web|last=Hopewell|first=John|title=Lumiere rocks to French classics|date=October 20, 2012|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|url=https://variety.com/2012/film/news/lumiere-rocks-to-french-classics-1118061036/|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref> (currently owned as a result of parent company [[Canal+ Group]]'s acquisition of cinema operator [[UGC (cinema operator)|UGC]] who acquired those companies, via [[The Cannon Group, Inc.|Cannon Films]]), including:\n** [[EMI Films]],<ref name=ealing/><ref>\"A.B.

WP:MOS-ZH--> was a [[Government of the Han dynasty#Kingdoms, marquisates, and fiefs of princesses|kingdom]] within the [[Han Empire]] of China, located in present-day [[Hunan]] and some surrounding areas. The kingdom was founded when [[Emperor Gaozu of Han|Emperor Gaozu]] granted the territory to [[Wu Rui (King of Changsha)|Wu Rui]], one of his main followers, around the same time as the establishment of the Han dynasty in 202 BC. Wu Rui and his descendants held the kingdom for five generations until Wu Zhu died without an heir in 157 BC. In 155 BC, the kingdom was reestablished for a member of the [[Family tree of the Han Dynasty|imperial family]]. However, the creation of this second kingdom coincided with the [[Rebellion of the Seven States]] and the subsequent reforms under [[Emperor Jing of Han|Emperor Jing]], and Changsha under the imperial family saw its autonomy greatly diminished. The kingdom was dissolved during [[Wang Mang]]'s [[Xin dynasty|usurpation]] (AD 9 \u2013 23), briefly restored after the founding of the [[Eastern Han dynasty|Eastern Han]], and finally abolished in {{nowrap|AD 33}} and converted to a [[Jun (country subdivision)|commandery]] under the imperial government.\n\nChangsha was one of the largest and longest-lasting kingdoms in Han China.{{sfn|He|2013|p=1}} Despite being established on the empire's frontier, technology and art flourished in Changsha. Numerous archaeological sites of the kingdom have been discovered and excavated; most notably [[Mawangdui]], the tomb of Changsha's [[Chancellor (China)|chancellor]] Li Cang and his family, providing valuable insights into life in the kingdom and Han dynasty in general.\n\n==History==\nThe first king of Changsha, [[Wu Rui (King of Changsha)|Wu Rui]], was a [[Baiyue]] leader who had been the magistrate of [[Poyang County]] under the [[Qin dynasty]] (221 \u2013 207 BC). He enjoyed high prestige among the local people and was known as \"Lord of the Po\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u756a|\u541b}}}}, ''P\u00f3j\u016bn'').{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=13}}{{sfn|He|2013|p=6}} \n\nIn {{nowrap|209 BC}}, a [[Dazexiang Uprising|a peasant uprising]] triggered a wave of rebellions that resulted in the [[collapse of Qin]]. After hearing news of the uprising, Wu Rui organized a mostly Baiyue army in support of the rebel. His forces soon grew to become a major faction in the civil war that ensued.{{sfn|He|2013|p=6}} In {{nowrap|207 BC}}, Rui's army joined forces with the Han leader [[Liu Bang]] (the future Emperor Gaozu, at the time one of the rebel generals) and marched to the [[Guanzhong Plain]], where they received the surrender of [[Ziying]], the last ruler of Qin.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=14}} One year later, the [[Western Chu|Chu]] Hegemon-King [[Xiang Yu]], then the most prominent leader in the rebellion, in [[Eighteen Kingdoms|an attempt to redivide the empire]], recognized Rui as the \"King of Hengshan\" {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u8861\u5c71|\u738b}}}},}} ''H\u00e9ngsh\u0101n W\u00e1ng''). Han would eventually won [[Chu\u2013Han Contention|its conflict]] with Chu and emerge as the preeminent power in China. In 203/{{nowrap|202 BC}}, Emperor Gaozu moved Wu Rui's fief{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=14}} and established the Kingdom of Changsha.{{sfn|Li|2014|p=330}} The capital was Linxiang and located within the present-day city of [[Changsha]].{{sfn|He|2013|pp=260\u2013266}} The new kingdom helped the Han dynasty consolidate control over the Chu heartland and served as a [[buffer state]] against the independent realm of [[Nanyue]] established by the Qin general [[Zhao Tuo]] in present-day [[Guangdong]].{{sfn|Luo|1998|pp=2\u20133}}{{sfn|He|2013|pp=3\u20135}} Rui died shortly after moving to his new territory, and the title passed to his son, Wu Chen {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5433|\u81e3}}}},}} ''W\u00fa Ch\u00e9n'').{{sfn|Li|2014|pp=331\u2013332}} Wu Chen reigned for eight years.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=30}}\n\nThe kings of Changsha were staunch supporters of the Han, and their loyalty and competence was praised by successive emperors.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=22}} In the first years after the founding of the Han Empire, the Emperor Gaozu embarked on a campaign to eliminate kings that were not members of the imperial family. The kings first grew to prominence as heads of independent factions in the chaos following Qin's fall, and the emperor viewed them as great threats to his authority. Changsha, located on the empire's southern fringe, was among the weakest among the kingdoms; however, it was the only one to survive beyond 190s BC.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=28}}{{sfn|Loewe|1986|pp=124\u2013125}} In {{nowrap|195 BC,}} [[Ying Bu]], King of [[Huainan]] and son-in-law of Wu Rui, rebelled against the Han and was defeated. As Ying retreated south of the [[Yangtze River]], the King of Changsha pretended to assist him in his escape to Nanyue but instead killed him in Cixiang {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u8332\u9109}}}},}} ''C\u00edxi\u0101ng'') near Poyang.{{sfn|Fu|1984|p=106}}{{sfn|Luo|1998|pp=25\u201326}}\n\nWu Chen was succeeded by his son Wu Hui {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5433|\u56de}}}},}} ''W\u00fa Hu\u00ed''). Hui reigned for seven years, and was succeeded by his son Wu You {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5433|\u53f3}}}},}} ''W\u00fa Y\u00f2u''), whose name is also recorded as Wu Ruo {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5433|\u82e5}}}},}} ''W\u00fa Ru\u00f2'').{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=30}}{{sfn|Fu|1984|p=107}} At the time, the Han dynasty was under [[Emperor Hui of Han|Emperor Hui]] and [[Empress L\u00fc]], who favored lenient laws and political views of the [[Huang\u2013Lao]] school of philosophy. Changsha was able to develop under relative peace.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=31}} In {{nowrap|183 BC,}} however, Empress L\u00fc banned the export of [[iron ware]] to Nanyue, which angered Zhao Tuo, who then proclaimed himself Emperor of Nanyue and then twice invaded Changsha, occupying a few [[county (China)|counties]].{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=32}}{{sfn|Loewe|1986|p=136}} Later, during Empress L\u00fc's reign, the imperial court decided to launch a military campaign against Nanyue. However, in the hot and humid summer, a plague broke out in the Han army, hindering its advance. The campaign was eventually cancelled with the death of Empress L\u00fc.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=32}} In {{nowrap|178 BC,}} the kingdom passed to Wu You's son Wu Zhu {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5433|\u8457}}}},}} ''W\u00fa Zh\u00f9''), for whom the names Wu Chai {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5433|\u5dee}}}},}} ''W\u00fa Ch\u0101i'') and Wu Chan {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5433|\u7522}}}},}} ''W\u00fa Ch\u01cen'') are alternatively used in some records.{{sfn|Fu|1984|p=113}} Wu Zhu reigned for twenty-one years, dying in {{nowrap|157 BC}} without male issue.{{sfn|He|2013|p=1}}{{sfn|Luo|1998|pp=32\u201335}}\n\nAfter the extinction of this house, [[Emperor Jing of Han|Emperor Jing]] granted Changsha to his son Liu Fa {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5289|\u767c}}}},}} ''Li\u00fa F\u0101'') in {{nowrap|155 BC.}}{{sfn|Luo|1998|pp=32\u201335}}{{sfn|Loewe|1986|pp=124\u2013125}} Fa's mother, Tang ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5510}}}}, ''T\u00e1ng''), was a servant of the Emperor's concubine Cheng ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u7a0b}}}}, ''Ch\u00e9ng'') and had given birth to Fa after the intoxicated emperor had mistaken her for his favorite concubine. Consequently, Fa had the lowest status among the Emperor's 14 sons and was [[Feoffment|enfeoffed]] in Changsha, far away from the capital [[Chang'an]] and the [[Zhongyuan|Central Plain]].{{sfn|Luo|1998|pp=35\u201336}} Changsha Kingdom was held by the Liu family until early the 1st century AD, when the Han dynasty was interrupted by usurper [[Wang Mang]]. Along with other kings of the Liu family in the empire, Liu Shun {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5289|\u821c}}}},}} ''Li\u00fa Sh\u00f9n''), the last King of Changsha, was demoted first to the rank of duke and then to a commoner.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=40}}{{sfn|Yi|1995|pp=65\u201368}} After the restoration of Han dynasty, the [[Emperor Guangwu of Han|Guangwu Emperor]], himself a descendant of Liu Fa, gave Changsha to Liu Shun's son Liu Xing {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5289|\u8208}}}},}} ''Li\u00fa X\u012bng'') in {{nowrap|AD 26.}} In 33 the Emperor rescinded the decision and demoted Xing to the rank of a marquis, citing the distance of kinship between Xing and himself.

The official ''[[Book of Han]]'' reports Changsha's border \u201creaching the north bank of [[Han River (Hubei)|Han River]] and stretching to [[Jiuyi Mountains]]\u201d, although it is unlikely that Changsha actually reached so far. Similarly, it reports that, when Emperor Gaozu created the Kingdom of Changsha, he granted Wu Rui authority over the five [[jun (administrative subdivision)|commanderies]] of Changsha, Yuzhang {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u8c6b\u7ae0}}}},}} ''Y\u00f9zh\u0101ng''), Xiang ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u8c61}}}}, ''Xi\u00e0ng''), Guilin {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u6842\u6797}}}},}} ''Gu\u00ecl\u00edn'') and Nanhai {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5357\u6d77}}}},}} ''N\u00e1nh\u01cei''). However, Yuzhang Commandery had already been conferred to Ying Bu, the King of Huainan, while Xiang, Guilin, and Nanhai Commanderies were all held by Zhao Tuo, the effectively independent King of Nanyue.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=42}} This state of the Changsha\u2013Nanyue border was confirmed in a [[Early Chinese cartography|map]] unearthed from the [[Mawangdui]] tombs.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=41}}{{sfn|He|2013|p=231}} On the other hand, other preserved and unearthed texts have shown that there were two other commanderies actually controlled by the Changsha Kingdom: Wuling {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u6b66\u9675}}}},}} ''W\u01d4l\u00edng'') and Guiyang {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u6842\u967d}}}},}} ''Gu\u00ecy\u00e1ng''). The first may have been granted by the imperial Han government; the historical geographer [[Zhou Zhenhe]] argues that the \"Yuzhang\" recorded in the ''Book of Han'' was simply a mistake for \"Wuling\", which would have been part of the original grant of the kingdom.{{sfn|Zhou|1987|p=119}} Guiyang was likely created by the kings of Changsha at some point for defense against invasions from Nanyue.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=41}}{{sfn|He|2013|p=231}}\n\nThe reconstruction offered by Zhou and [[Tan Qixiang]] is that Changsha's northern border ran along modern [[Tongcheng County|Tongcheng]], [[Songzi]], and [[Gong'an County|Gong'an]] counties; the western border along modern [[Longshan County|Longshan]], [[Zhenyuan County, Guizhou|Zhenyuan]], and [[Jingzhou County|Jingzhou]] counties; and the eastern border along modern [[Gao'an]], [[Yichun, Jiangxi|Yichuan]], [[Lianhua County|Lianhua]], and [[Chaling County|Chaling]] counties. Changsha's southern frontier with Nanyue was approximately the modern southern border of Hunan.{{sfn|He|2013|pp=221\u2013240}}\n\nWhen Emperor Jing granted Changsha to his son Liu Fa, the kingdom's territory was reduced to Changsha Commandery alone. Consequently, the kingdom's southwestern border was in the vicinity of modern Chaling, [[Wugang, Hunan|Wugang]] and [[Quanzhou County|Quanzhou]] counties.{{sfn|He|2013|pp=221\u2013240}} From Emperor Wu's reign onward, 20 [[Government of the Han dynasty#Kingdoms, marquisates, and fiefs of princesses|marquisates]] was created from Changsha. These marquisates were administered as parts of neighboring commanderies, further reducing the kingdom's territory.{{sfn|Zhou|1987|pp=122\u2013125}}\n\n==Demographics==\nChangsha was sparsely populated compared to other parts of the Han dynasty.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=78}} The population primarily consisted of descendants of [[Chu (state)|Chu]] colonizers, members of the Qin military garrison and their offspring, assimilated [[Nanman]], and the native Baiyue tribes. Zhao Tuo, King of Nanyue, claimed that \"half of Changsha are [[Four Barbarians|Man and Yi]]\". [[Jia Yi]], grand tutor of the king from 176 to {{nowrap|172 BC,}} wrote that there were only 25,000 households in the kingdom,{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=50}} although it is likely that the figure was an underestimate.{{sfn|Fu|1984|p=110}} (Jia, an advocate for further limits on the kingdoms' autonomy, saw Changsha's weakness as a reason of its loyalty.) However, the population increased rapidly, partly due to the favorable agricultural policies and partly because of immigration both from within the Han empire and from Nanyue.{{sfn|Luo|1998|pp=52\u201353}} In {{nowrap|AD 2,}} when the Han dynasty conducted an empire-wide population census, the population of Changsha was recorded as 235,825 living in 43,470 households. The commanderies that constituted the larger Changsha of the early Han dynasty together had a population of 717,433 living in 126,858 households, a five-fold increase from Jia Yi's estimation during the early Han period.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=52}}\n\n==Government==\n[[File:\u201c\u957f\u6c99\u76f8\u5370\u7ae0\u201d\u5c01\u6ce5.jpg|thumb|A clay imprint of the [[seal (East Asia)|seal]] of the chancellor of the Changsha Kingdom]]\nIn the early Han dynasty, the government structure of the vassal kingdoms closely followed that of the [[Government of the Han dynasty#Central government|Han central government]], but differences remained.{{sfn|He|2013|p=250}} As in the imperial government, the chancellor {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u76f8\u570b}}}},}} ''xi\u00e0nggu\u00f3'', before {{nowrap|194 BC}} and {{nowrap|{{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u4e1e\u76f8}}}},}} ''ch\u00e9ngxi\u00e0ng'', thereafter) was the highest civil office and the leader of the government.{{sfn|Wu|1990|pp=110\u2013111}} However, the chancellor was not directly responsible for the kingdom's everyday affairs, which were overseen by the court clerk {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5167\u53f2}}}},}} ''n\u00e8ish\u01d0'')&mdash;the same post in the imperial government was only in charge of finance and affairs in the capital region.{{sfn|Wu|1990|p=111}} The responsibilities of the royal secretary {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5fa1\u53f2|\u5927\u592b}}}},}} ''y\u00f9sh\u01d0 d\u00e0f\u016b'') were similar to the imperial equivalent, i.e. supervision over the bureaucrats, although his status was likely lower than the court clerk.{{sfn|Wu|1990|p=112}} The imperial [[Nine Ministers]] also had their equivalents in the kingdom.{{sfn|Bielenstein|1980|p=105}} Except for the chancellor and grand tutor {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u592a\u5085}}}},}} ''t\u00e0if\u00f9'') who were selected by the imperial court, all officials were appointed by the king.{{sfn|He|2013|p=250}} Compared to the central government, where the crown princes' tutors had little real authority, the grand tutor played a much more extensive role in a kingdom, as he supervised the king for the imperial government.{{sfn|Wu|1990|p=112}} Meanwhile, the high status of the court clerk was similar to that of the [[Warring States]] rather than the Han central government.{{sfn|Wu|1990|p=122}} In addition, early Changsha had a unique office, the \"pillar of state\" {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u67f1|\u570b}}}},}} ''zh\u00f9gu\u00f3''). It was designation for an eminent official originating from the Chu state, but was not seen elsewhere in the Han dynasty;{{sfn|Wu|1990|p=122}} the post may have merged into or been replaced by that of the chancellor.{{sfn|He|2013|p=254}}\n\nUnder the Wu family, the Changsha Kingdom was administered at two levels, the [[jun (administrative subdivision)|commandery]] and the [[county (China)|county]]. As [[#Territory|described above]], the state is believed to have consisted of the three commanderies of Changsha, Wuling, and Guiyang and to have claimed further commanderies under Nanyue's control. The three actual commanderies were divided into over 40 counties.{{sfn|Fu|1984|p=111}}{{sfn|He|2013|p=175}} Under the cadet branch of the Liu family, the Changsha Kingdom eliminated the needless commandery level as its territory had been much reduced. In {{nowrap|AD 2,}} the kingdom only administered thirteen counties.{{sfn|Fu|1984|p=111}}{{sfn|He|2013|p=175}}\n\nIn regions inhabited by the Baiyue, larger but less populated [[circuit (administrative division)|circuits]] were used in place of counties.

Counties were each headed by a [[county magistrate|magistrate]] and were subdivided into [[township (China)|townships]] and villages ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u91cc}}}}, ''l\u01d0'') in the same manner as in centrally administered territories of the Han dynasty.{{sfn|Yi|1995|pp=65\u201368}}{{sfn|Loewe|1986|p=151}}\n\nThe reestablishment of the Changsha Kingdom under Liu Fa coincided with the abortive [[Rebellion of the Seven States]] and the subsequent drastic measures to limit the autonomy of kingdoms by Emperor Jing. In {{nowrap|145 BC,}} the vassal kingdoms were stripped of the right to appoint officials with salaries higher than [[Government of the Han dynasty#Salaries|400 ''dan'']], which covered everyone from ministers in the royal court to county magistrates.{{sfn|Bielenstein|1980|p=106}} Furthermore, changes were made to the government hierarchy of kingdoms. A number of offices were abolished, including the royal secretary, minister of justice {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5ef7\u5c09}}}},}} ''t\u00edngw\u00e8i''), minister of the royal clan {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5b97\u6b63}}}},}} ''z\u014dngzh\u00e8ng''), steward {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5c11\u5e9c}}}},}} ''sh\u01ceof\u01d4''), and court scholar {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u535a\u58eb}}}},}} ''b\u00f3sh\u00ec'').{{sfn|He|2013|p=253}} Of particular importance was the abolishment of the steward, as this move deprived the kings of their fiscal control over the fief.{{sfn|Bielenstein|1980|p=106}} Many remaining offices were demoted in rank, and lesser officials were reduced in number.{{sfn|He|2013|p=253}} The titles of the chancellor and tutor were shortened to simply ''xi\u00e0ng'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u76f8}}}}) and ''f\u00f9'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5085}}}}) to distinguish them from their imperial equivalents.{{sfn|Bielenstein|1980|p=106}} Later, in {{nowrap|8 BC,}} the court clerk was abolished and the chancellor took over his duties.

WP:MOS-ZH--> was a [[Government of the Han dynasty#Kingdoms, marquisates, and fiefs of princesses|kingdom]] within the [[Han Empire]] of China, located in present-day [[Hunan]] and some surrounding areas. The kingdom was founded when [[Emperor Gaozu of Han|Emperor Gaozu]] granted the territory to [[Wu Rui (King of Changsha)|Wu Rui]], one of his main followers, around the same time as the establishment of the Han dynasty in 202 BC. Wu Rui and his descendants held the kingdom for five generations until Wu Zhu died without an heir in 157 BC. In 155 BC, the kingdom was reestablished for a member of the [[Family tree of the Han Dynasty|imperial family]]. However, the creation of this second kingdom coincided with the [[Rebellion of the Seven States]] and the subsequent reforms under [[Emperor Jing of Han|Emperor Jing]], and Changsha under the imperial family saw its autonomy greatly diminished. The kingdom was dissolved during [[Wang Mang]]'s [[Xin dynasty|usurpation]] (AD 9 \u2013 23), briefly restored after the founding of the [[Eastern Han dynasty|Eastern Han]], and finally abolished in {{nowrap|AD 33}} and converted to a [[Jun (country subdivision)|commandery]] under the imperial government.\n\nChangsha was one of the largest and longest-lasting kingdoms in Han China.{{sfn|He|2013|p=1}} Despite being established on the empire's frontier, technology and art flourished in Changsha. Numerous archaeological sites of the kingdom have been discovered and excavated; most notably [[Mawangdui]], the tomb of Changsha's [[Chancellor (China)|chancellor]] Li Cang and his family, providing valuable insights into life in the kingdom and Han dynasty in general.\n\n==History==\nThe first king of Changsha, [[Wu Rui (King of Changsha)|Wu Rui]], was a [[Baiyue]] leader who had been the magistrate of [[Poyang County]] under the [[Qin dynasty]] (221 \u2013 207 BC). He enjoyed high prestige among the local people and was known as \"Lord of the Po\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u756a|\u541b}}}}, ''P\u00f3j\u016bn'').{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=13}}{{sfn|He|2013|p=6}} \n\nIn {{nowrap|209 BC}}, a [[Dazexiang Uprising|a peasant uprising]] triggered a wave of rebellions that resulted in the [[collapse of Qin]]. After hearing news of the uprising, Wu Rui organized a mostly Baiyue army in support of the rebel. His forces soon grew to become a major faction in the civil war that ensued.{{sfn|He|2013|p=6}} In {{nowrap|207 BC}}, Rui's army joined forces with the Han leader [[Liu Bang]] (the future Emperor Gaozu, at the time one of the rebel generals) and marched to the [[Guanzhong Plain]], where they received the surrender of [[Ziying]], the last ruler of Qin.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=14}} One year later, the [[Western Chu|Chu]] Hegemon-King [[Xiang Yu]], then the most prominent leader in the rebellion, in [[Eighteen Kingdoms|an attempt to redivide the empire]], recognized Rui as the \"King of Hengshan\" {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u8861\u5c71|\u738b}}}},}} ''H\u00e9ngsh\u0101n W\u00e1ng''). Han would eventually won [[Chu\u2013Han Contention|its conflict]] with Chu and emerge as the preeminent power in China. In 203/{{nowrap|202 BC}}, Emperor Gaozu moved Wu Rui's fief{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=14}} and established the Kingdom of Changsha.{{sfn|Li|2014|p=330}} The capital was Linxiang and located within the present-day city of [[Changsha]].{{sfn|He|2013|pp=260\u2013266}} The new kingdom helped the Han dynasty consolidate control over the Chu heartland and served as a [[buffer state]] against the independent realm of [[Nanyue]] established by the Qin general [[Zhao Tuo]] in present-day [[Guangdong]].{{sfn|Luo|1998|pp=2\u20133}}{{sfn|He|2013|pp=3\u20135}} Rui died shortly after moving to his new territory, and the title passed to his son, Wu Chen {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5433|\u81e3}}}},}} ''W\u00fa Ch\u00e9n'').{{sfn|Li|2014|pp=331\u2013332}} Wu Chen reigned for eight years.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=30}}\n\nThe kings of Changsha were staunch supporters of the Han, and their loyalty and competence was praised by successive emperors.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=22}} In the first years after the founding of the Han Empire, the Emperor Gaozu embarked on a campaign to eliminate kings that were not members of the imperial family. The kings first grew to prominence as heads of independent factions in the chaos following Qin's fall, and the emperor viewed them as great threats to his authority. Changsha, located on the empire's southern fringe, was among the weakest among the kingdoms; however, it was the only one to survive beyond 190s BC.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=28}}{{sfn|Loewe|1986|pp=124\u2013125}} In {{nowrap|195 BC,}} [[Ying Bu]], King of [[Huainan]] and son-in-law of Wu Rui, rebelled against the Han and was defeated. As Ying retreated south of the [[Yangtze River]], the King of Changsha pretended to assist him in his escape to Nanyue but instead killed him in Cixiang {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u8332\u9109}}}},}} ''C\u00edxi\u0101ng'') near Poyang.{{sfn|Fu|1984|p=106}}{{sfn|Luo|1998|pp=25\u201326}}\n\nWu Chen was succeeded by his son Wu Hui {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5433|\u56de}}}},}} ''W\u00fa Hu\u00ed''). Hui reigned for seven years, and was succeeded by his son Wu You {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5433|\u53f3}}}},}} ''W\u00fa Y\u00f2u''), whose name is also recorded as Wu Ruo {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5433|\u82e5}}}},}} ''W\u00fa Ru\u00f2'').{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=30}}{{sfn|Fu|1984|p=107}} At the time, the Han dynasty was under [[Emperor Hui of Han|Emperor Hui]] and [[Empress L\u00fc]], who favored lenient laws and political views of the [[Huang\u2013Lao]] school of philosophy. Changsha was able to develop under relative peace.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=31}} In {{nowrap|183 BC,}} however, Empress L\u00fc banned the export of [[iron ware]] to Nanyue, which angered Zhao Tuo, who then proclaimed himself Emperor of Nanyue and then twice invaded Changsha, occupying a few [[county (China)|counties]].{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=32}}{{sfn|Loewe|1986|p=136}} Later, during Empress L\u00fc's reign, the imperial court decided to launch a military campaign against Nanyue. However, in the hot and humid summer, a plague broke out in the Han army, hindering its advance. The campaign was eventually cancelled with the death of Empress L\u00fc.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=32}} In {{nowrap|178 BC,}} the kingdom passed to Wu You's son Wu Zhu {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5433|\u8457}}}},}} ''W\u00fa Zh\u00f9''), for whom the names Wu Chai {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5433|\u5dee}}}},}} ''W\u00fa Ch\u0101i'') and Wu Chan {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5433|\u7522}}}},}} ''W\u00fa Ch\u01cen'') are alternatively used in some records.{{sfn|Fu|1984|p=113}} Wu Zhu reigned for twenty-one years, dying in {{nowrap|157 BC}} without male issue.{{sfn|He|2013|p=1}}{{sfn|Luo|1998|pp=32\u201335}}\n\nAfter the extinction of this house, [[Emperor Jing of Han|Emperor Jing]] granted Changsha to his son Liu Fa {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5289|\u767c}}}},}} ''Li\u00fa F\u0101'') in {{nowrap|155 BC.}}{{sfn|Luo|1998|pp=32\u201335}}{{sfn|Loewe|1986|pp=124\u2013125}} Fa's mother, Tang ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5510}}}}, ''T\u00e1ng''), was a servant of the Emperor's concubine Cheng ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u7a0b}}}}, ''Ch\u00e9ng'') and had given birth to Fa after the intoxicated emperor had mistaken her for his favorite concubine. Consequently, Fa had the lowest status among the Emperor's 14 sons and was [[Feoffment|enfeoffed]] in Changsha, far away from the capital [[Chang'an]] and the [[Zhongyuan|Central Plain]].{{sfn|Luo|1998|pp=35\u201336}} Changsha Kingdom was held by the Liu family until early the 1st century AD, when the Han dynasty was interrupted by usurper [[Wang Mang]]. Along with other kings of the Liu family in the empire, Liu Shun {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5289|\u821c}}}},}} ''Li\u00fa Sh\u00f9n''), the last King of Changsha, was demoted first to the rank of duke and then to a commoner.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=40}}{{sfn|Yi|1995|pp=65\u201368}} After the restoration of Han dynasty, the [[Emperor Guangwu of Han|Guangwu Emperor]], himself a descendant of Liu Fa, gave Changsha to Liu Shun's son Liu Xing {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5289|\u8208}}}},}} ''Li\u00fa X\u012bng'') in {{nowrap|AD 26.}} In 33 the Emperor rescinded the decision and demoted Xing to the rank of a marquis, citing the distance of kinship between Xing and himself. Changsha was administered as an imperial [[Jun (country subdivision)|commandery]] thereafter.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=40}}\n\n==Territory==\n[[File:Western Han Mawangdui Silk Map.JPG|thumb|Silk map unearthed from Mawangdui, showing Changsha and the neighboring kingdom of [[Nanyue]].]]\n\nThe exact extent of the first Changsha Kingdom is still unclear. The official ''[[Book of Han]]'' reports Changsha's border \u201creaching the north bank of [[Han River (Hubei)|Han River]] and stretching to [[Jiuyi Mountains]]\u201d, although it is unlikely that Changsha actually reached so far. Similarly, it reports that, when Emperor Gaozu created the Kingdom of Changsha, he granted Wu Rui authority over the five [[jun (administrative subdivision)|commanderies]] of Changsha, Yuzhang {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u8c6b\u7ae0}}}},}} ''Y\u00f9zh\u0101ng''), Xiang ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u8c61}}}}, ''Xi\u00e0ng''), Guilin {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u6842\u6797}}}},}} ''Gu\u00ecl\u00edn'') and Nanhai {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5357\u6d77}}}},}} ''N\u00e1nh\u01cei''). However, Yuzhang Commandery had already been conferred to Ying Bu, the King of Huainan, while Xiang, Guilin, and Nanhai Commanderies were all held by Zhao Tuo, the effectively independent King of Nanyue.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=42}} This state of the Changsha\u2013Nanyue border was confirmed in a [[Early Chinese cartography|map]] unearthed from the [[Mawangdui]] tombs.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=41}}{{sfn|He|2013|p=231}} On the other hand, other preserved and unearthed texts have shown that there were two other commanderies actually controlled by the Changsha Kingdom: Wuling {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u6b66\u9675}}}},}} ''W\u01d4l\u00edng'') and Guiyang {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u6842\u967d}}}},}} ''Gu\u00ecy\u00e1ng''). The first may have been granted by the imperial Han government; the historical geographer [[Zhou Zhenhe]] argues that the \"Yuzhang\" recorded in the ''Book of Han'' was simply a mistake for \"Wuling\", which would have been part of the original grant of the kingdom.{{sfn|Zhou|1987|p=119}} Guiyang was likely created by the kings of Changsha at some point for defense against invasions from Nanyue.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=41}}{{sfn|He|2013|p=231}}\n\nThe reconstruction offered by Zhou and [[Tan Qixiang]] is that Changsha's northern border ran along modern [[Tongcheng County|Tongcheng]], [[Songzi]], and [[Gong'an County|Gong'an]] counties; the western border along modern [[Longshan County|Longshan]], [[Zhenyuan County, Guizhou|Zhenyuan]], and [[Jingzhou County|Jingzhou]] counties; and the eastern border along modern [[Gao'an]], [[Yichun, Jiangxi|Yichuan]], [[Lianhua County|Lianhua]], and [[Chaling County|Chaling]] counties. Changsha's southern frontier with Nanyue was approximately the modern southern border of Hunan.{{sfn|He|2013|pp=221\u2013240}}\n\nWhen Emperor Jing granted Changsha to his son Liu Fa, the kingdom's territory was reduced to Changsha Commandery alone. Consequently, the kingdom's southwestern border was in the vicinity of modern Chaling, [[Wugang, Hunan|Wugang]] and [[Quanzhou County|Quanzhou]] counties.{{sfn|He|2013|pp=221\u2013240}} From Emperor Wu's reign onward, 20 [[Government of the Han dynasty#Kingdoms, marquisates, and fiefs of princesses|marquisates]] was created from Changsha. These marquisates were administered as parts of neighboring commanderies, further reducing the kingdom's territory.{{sfn|Zhou|1987|pp=122\u2013125}}\n\n==Demographics==\nChangsha was sparsely populated compared to other parts of the Han dynasty.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=78}} The population primarily consisted of descendants of [[Chu (state)|Chu]] colonizers, members of the Qin military garrison and their offspring, assimilated [[Nanman]], and the native Baiyue tribes. Zhao Tuo, King of Nanyue, claimed that \"half of Changsha are [[Four Barbarians|Man and Yi]]\". [[Jia Yi]], grand tutor of the king from 176 to {{nowrap|172 BC,}} wrote that there were only 25,000 households in the kingdom,{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=50}} although it is likely that the figure was an underestimate.{{sfn|Fu|1984|p=110}} (Jia, an advocate for further limits on the kingdoms' autonomy, saw Changsha's weakness as a reason of its loyalty.) However, the population increased rapidly, partly due to the favorable agricultural policies and partly because of immigration both from within the Han empire and from Nanyue.{{sfn|Luo|1998|pp=52\u201353}} In {{nowrap|AD 2,}} when the Han dynasty conducted an empire-wide population census, the population of Changsha was recorded as 235,825 living in 43,470 households. The commanderies that constituted the larger Changsha of the early Han dynasty together had a population of 717,433 living in 126,858 households, a five-fold increase from Jia Yi's estimation during the early Han period.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=52}}\n\n==Government==\n[[File:\u201c\u957f\u6c99\u76f8\u5370\u7ae0\u201d\u5c01\u6ce5.jpg|thumb|A clay imprint of the [[seal (East Asia)|seal]] of the chancellor of the Changsha Kingdom]]\nIn the early Han dynasty, the government structure of the vassal kingdoms closely followed that of the [[Government of the Han dynasty#Central government|Han central government]], but differences remained.{{sfn|He|2013|p=250}} As in the imperial government, the chancellor {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u76f8\u570b}}}},}} ''xi\u00e0nggu\u00f3'', before {{nowrap|194 BC}} and {{nowrap|{{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u4e1e\u76f8}}}},}} ''ch\u00e9ngxi\u00e0ng'', thereafter) was the highest civil office and the leader of the government.{{sfn|Wu|1990|pp=110\u2013111}} However, the chancellor was not directly responsible for the kingdom's everyday affairs, which were overseen by the court clerk {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5167\u53f2}}}},}} ''n\u00e8ish\u01d0'')&mdash;the same post in the imperial government was only in charge of finance and affairs in the capital region.{{sfn|Wu|1990|p=111}} The responsibilities of the royal secretary {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5fa1\u53f2|\u5927\u592b}}}},}} ''y\u00f9sh\u01d0 d\u00e0f\u016b'') was similar to the imperial equivalent, i.e. supervision over the bureaucrats, although his status was likely lower than the court clerk.{{sfn|Wu|1990|p=112}} The imperial [[Nine Ministers]] also had their equivalents in the kingdom.{{sfn|Bielenstein|1980|p=105}} Except for the chancellor and grand tutor {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u592a\u5085}}}},}} ''t\u00e0if\u00f9'') who were selected by the imperial court, all officials were appointed by the king.{{sfn|He|2013|p=250}} Compared to the central government, where the crown princes' tutors had little real authority, the grand tutor played a much more extensive role in a kingdom, as he supervised the king for the imperial government.{{sfn|Wu|1990|p=112}} Meanwhile, the high status of the court clerk was similar to that of the [[Warring States]] rather than the Han central government.{{sfn|Wu|1990|p=122}} In addition, early Changsha had a unique office, the \"pillar of state\" {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u67f1|\u570b}}}},}} ''zh\u00f9gu\u00f3''). It was designation for an eminent official originating from the Chu state, but was not seen elsewhere in the Han dynasty;{{sfn|Wu|1990|p=122}} the post may have merged into or been replaced by that of the chancellor.{{sfn|He|2013|p=254}}\n\nUnder the Wu family, the Changsha Kingdom was administered at two levels, the [[jun (administrative subdivision)|commandery]] and the [[county (China)|county]]. As [[#Territory|described above]], the state is believed to have consisted of the three commanderies of Changsha, Wuling, and Guiyang and to have claimed further commanderies under Nanyue's control. The three actual commanderies were divided into over 40 counties.{{sfn|Fu|1984|p=111}}{{sfn|He|2013|p=175}} Under the cadet branch of the Liu family, the Changsha Kingdom eliminated the needless commandery level as its territory had been much reduced. In {{nowrap|AD 2,}} the kingdom only administered thirteen counties.{{sfn|Fu|1984|p=111}}{{sfn|He|2013|p=175}}\n\nIn regions inhabited by the Baiyue, larger but less populated [[circuit (administrative division)|circuits]] were used in place of counties. Two circuits{{mdash}}He ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u9f55}}}}, ''H\u00e9'') and Ling ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u6ce0}}}}, ''L\u00edng''){{mdash}}are noted on the map unearthed at Mawangdui. Counties were each headed by a [[county magistrate|magistrate]] and were subdivided into [[township (China)|townships]] and villages ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u91cc}}}}, ''l\u01d0'') in the same manner as in centrally administered territories of the Han dynasty.{{sfn|Yi|1995|pp=65\u201368}}{{sfn|Loewe|1986|p=151}}\n\nThe reestablishment of the Changsha Kingdom under Liu Fa coincided with the abortive [[Rebellion of the Seven States]] and the subsequent drastic measures to limit the autonomy of kingdoms by Emperor Jing. In {{nowrap|145 BC,}} the vassal kingdoms were stripped of the right to appoint officials with salaries higher than [[Government of the Han dynasty#Salaries|400 ''dan'']], which covered everyone from ministers in the royal court to county magistrates.{{sfn|Bielenstein|1980|p=106}} Furthermore, changes were made to the government hierarchy of kingdoms. A number of offices were abolished, including the royal secretary, minister of justice {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5ef7\u5c09}}}},}} ''t\u00edngw\u00e8i''), minister of the royal clan {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5b97\u6b63}}}},}} ''z\u014dngzh\u00e8ng''), steward {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5c11\u5e9c}}}},}} ''sh\u01ceof\u01d4''), and court scholar {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u535a\u58eb}}}},}} ''b\u00f3sh\u00ec'').{{sfn|He|2013|p=253}} Of particular importance was the abolishment of the steward, as this move deprived the kings of their fiscal control over the fief.{{sfn|Bielenstein|1980|p=106}} Many remaining offices were demoted in rank, and lesser officials were reduced in number.{{sfn|He|2013|p=253}} The titles of the chancellor and tutor were shortened to simply ''xi\u00e0ng'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u76f8}}}}) and ''f\u00f9'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5085}}}}) to distinguish them from their imperial equivalents.{{sfn|Bielenstein|1980|p=106}} Later, in {{nowrap|8 BC,}} the court clerk was abolished and the chancellor took over his duties.

Unaware of the Box's nature, Deckard opens it, unleashing all kinds of [[mythological creature]]s rampaging throughout the world, as well as granting him a strange power (the Signet) which could be the key to resolving this crisis. It is up to Deckard and a secret paramilitary force known as the Council of 98 to set things right, while the Black Order seeks to acquire the box and control the creatures to conquer the world.\n\n==Gameplay==\nGameplay is similar to many other titles in the genre of first-person shooters, with a strong focus on immersion and penetrating atmosphere, creating a first person movie-like experience. Several different weapons can be found and equipped, generally being taken from dead humans. The only melee weapon available in the game is a fire axe, which cannot be removed from the player character's inventory. In addition to the axe, two other weapons can be carried, as well as grenades and molotovs. The player also has access to a PDA-style journal, which updates with messages as data is found and whenever Deckard is given orders or instructions. It also includes detailed information on the monsters and weapons encountered. Throughout the gameworld, numerous objects must be interacted with to proceed, including switches. wheels and lockboxes. The player's health is monitored by a bar in the corner of the screen, while Animus energy is represented by a spherical gauge. Animus energy can be collected by killing monsters, which leave behind bluish gaseous residue. The player can then absorb the residue, replenishing the Animus gauge. This energy can then be used to heal the player, or to send destructive pulses towards monsters (human enemies are not affected by this), stunning them. Additionally, certain objects must be fed Animus energy in order to function properly.\n\n===Multiplayer===\nThere is one mode in multiplayer, which can be played with up to 8 people online or through system link (1 player per console). Multiplayer pits the Council of 98 and the Black Order against each other. The multiplayer portion's objective is not to kill as many opposing team members as possible. The objective is to collect Animus Energy and put it into a machine. The team that fills up the machine first wins. There are creatures on the field, and the player has to kill them in order to harvest Animus Energy. The creatures automatically attack team members with the lower amount of Animus Energy in their machine.\n\n==Plot==\nThe game's prologue slide show shows the original myth of Pandora's Box; in reality, Pandora's Box was a device of incredible power. In the early 21st century, archaeologists found the artifact in a ruin at the bottom of the ocean. Unable to pinpoint its origins, they place the artifact in a New York City museum for safe keeping. A wealthy millionaire named Ormond LeFey, knowing the true nature of the box, hires a professional thief named Charles Deckard, tasking him with opening the box, and stealing the contents inside (with, of course, a substantial payment).\n\nThe game opens with Deckard sneaking into the museum, easily bypassing all the security and opening the box. When he does, he has a Signet branded onto his left hand, and the box suddenly releases a huge energy surge that shoots toward the sky. Deckard gains the ability to absorb Animus Energy, which he can use to heal himself. He escapes the museum to discover that [[griffin]]s have materialized, and are flying through the city attacking people.\n\nAfter fighting various mythical creatures summoned by the box, Deckard finds out that LeFey has sent his private army, known as the Black Order, against him. He fights his way through those soldiers, eventually meeting up with the Council of 98, the group that originally concealed the box. They are distrusting at first, especially their commander, Lexington White Deer, but eventually agree to help upon seeing the Signet on Deckard's arm. A deal is struck; in exchange for his associate Vivian Kane's information on the Black Order's plans, the Council will help them.\n\nAfter defeating a [[golem]], The Council takes Deckard, Kane, and the box to where the headquarters of the Council is stationed: beneath the [[Houses of Parliament]] in London. After a mission to locate a hard drive detailing LeFey's plans in an abandoned cathedral, Deckard finds out that LeFey has built a machine that could harness Animus Energy and control the creatures. He aims to use it to take over the world. The surge of energy could also find its way to Deckard's Signet, and the energy surge could kill him.\n\nSuddenly, the power goes out. It turns out that the hard drive also contained a [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan Horse]], which powered off all the power in the facility. All the creatures that they were keeping are released. The hard drive also gave the location of the headquarters away, and Black Order soldiers land and attack. Deckard and all the Council soldiers get up onto the roof, where they wait for reinforcements from other parts of the world. Suddenly, a [[Kraken]] surfaces in the [[Thames]] and attacks. Firing several rockets down the Kraken's mouth, Deckard succeeds in killing the Kraken. While the Council was distracted, however, the Black Order manages to steal Pandora's Box, and kidnap Vivian Kane. Deckard and the Council chase after them back to New York City.\n\nIn New York City, Deckard and the Council launch a full-scale attack on the Black Order headquarters. Inside the building, he manages to free Vivian, and she goes up the command post to help Deckard. On the roof, Deckard finds the machine. It turns out that Deckard can overload the machine, and destroy it by putting a lot of Animus Energy inside of it. In the end, the machine overloads, and then explodes. LeFey is hurled out of his control booth by a [[werewolf]], grabbed in midair by a griffin and impaled on the machine, killing him. After the explosion, Vivian is nowhere to be seen. The Council arrives, and assumes that she was vaporized. The Council immediately turns on Deckard, locking him up, stating that Deckard's Signet contains information that could create a new Pandora's Box, the first one being destroyed when the machine exploded. Later, it turns out that Vivian survived, and Deckard, being a thief, easily escapes. A final picture shows Deckard holding his Signet branded hand out to a griffin, seemingly taming it.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| PC = true\n| PS3 = true\n| X360 = true\n| na = true\n| Edge_X360 = 4/10<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Legendary (X360) |author=Edge staff |magazine=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] |issue=195 |date=December 2008 |page=98}}</ref>\n| EuroG_X360 = 2/10<ref name=\"eurog\">{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/legendary-review |title=Legendary (Xbox 360) |last=Whitehead |first=Dan |date=October 31, 2008 |website=[[Eurogamer]] |accessdate=September 30, 2017}}</ref>\n| GI_PC = 6.5/10<ref name=\"gi\"/>\n| GI_PS3 = 6.5/10<ref name=\"gi\"/>\n| GI_X360 = 6.5/10<ref name=\"gi\">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/legendary/b/xbox360/archive/2009/09/22/review.aspx |title=Legendary: A Heavy Dose of Mythological Creatures Cannot Make Up for Lackluster Gunplay |last=Cork |first=Jeff |magazine=[[Game Informer]] |issue=189 |date=January 2009 |page=66 |accessdate=October 1, 2017}}</ref>\n| GameRev_X360 = D\u2212<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/42753-legendary-review |title=Legendary Review (X360) |last=Card |first=Ben |date=February 2, 2009 |publisher=[[Game Revolution]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911234507/http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/legendary-the-box |archivedate=September 11, 2015 |url-status=live |accessdate=October 1, 2017}}</ref>\n| GSpot_PC = 3.5/10<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/legendary-review/1900-6201614/ |title=Legendary Review (PC) |last=VanOrd |first=Kevin |date=November 24, 2008 |website=GameSpot |accessdate=October 1, 2017}}</ref>\n| GSpot_X360 = 3.5/10<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/legendary-review/1900-6200825/ |title=Legendary Review (X360) |last=VanOrd |first=Kevin |date=November 10, 2008 |website=GameSpot |accessdate=October 1, 2017}}</ref>\n| GameZone_PC = 5/10<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamezone.com/reviews/legendary_pc_review |title=Legendary - PC - Review |last=Lafferty |first=Michael |date=January 7, 2009 |publisher=GameZone |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116144537/http://pc.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r32990.htm |archivedate=January 16, 2009 |url-status=live |accessdate=October 1, 2017}}</ref>\n| GameZone_PS3 = 5.6/10<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamezone.com/reviews/legendary_ps3_review |title=Legendary - PS3 - Review |last=Myers |first=Dallas |date=December 15, 2008 |publisher=GameZone |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219140850/http://ps3.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r32990.htm |archivedate=December 19, 2008 |url-status=live |accessdate=October 1, 2017}}</ref>\n| GameZone_X360 = 7.5/10<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamezone.com/reviews/legendary_360_review |title=Legendary - 360 - Review |last=Platt |first=Dylan |date=January 1, 2009 |publisher=GameZone |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321110038/http://xbox360.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r32990.htm |archivedate=March 21, 2009 |url-status=live |accessdate=October 1, 2017}}</ref>\n| IGN_PC = 2.5/10<ref name=\"ignpcrev\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/12/05/legendary-review-2 |title=Legendary Review (PC) |last=Haynes |first=Jeff |date=December 5, 2008 |website=IGN |accessdate=September 30, 2017}}</ref>\n| IGN_PS3 = 2.3/10<ref name=\"ignps3rev\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/11/06/legendary-review-4 |title=Legendary Review (PS3) |last=Haynes |first=Jeff |date=November 6, 2008 |website=IGN |accessdate=September 30, 2017}}</ref>\n| IGN_X360 = 2.5/10<ref name=\"ignrev\"/>\n| OXM_X360 = 7.5/10<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.oxmonline.com/article/reviews/xbox-360/g-l/legendary |title=Legendary |last=McCaffrey |first=Ryan |magazine=[[Official Xbox Magazine]] |date=December 2008 |page=90 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119161729/http://www.oxmonline.com/article/reviews/xbox-360/g-l/legendary |archivedate=November 19, 2008 |url-status=dead |accessdate=September 30, 2017}}</ref>\n| PCGUK_PC = 40%<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Legendary |magazine=[[PC Gamer|PC Gamer UK]] |date=January 2009 |page=70}}</ref>\n| PSM_PS3 = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Review: Legendary |magazine=[[PlayStation: The Official Magazine]] |issue=14 |date=December 25, 2008 |page=88}}</ref>\n| rev1 = ''[[The A.V.

He fights his way through those soldiers, eventually meeting up with the Council of 98, the group that originally concealed the box. They are distrusting at first, especially their commander, Lexington White Deer, but eventually agree to help upon seeing the Signet on Deckard's arm. A deal is struck; in exchange for his associate Vivian Kane's information on the Black Order's plans, the Council will help them.\n\nAfter defeating a [[golem]], The Council takes Deckard, Kane, and the box to where the headquarters of the Council is stationed: beneath the [[Houses of Parliament]] in London. After a mission to locate a hard drive detailing LeFey's plans in an abandoned cathedral, Deckard finds out that LeFey has built a machine that could harness Animus Energy and control the creatures. He aims to use it to take over the world. The surge of energy could also find its way to Deckard's Signet, and the energy surge could kill him.\n\nSuddenly, the power goes out. It turns out that the hard drive also contained a [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan Horse]], which powered off all the power in the facility. All the creatures that they were keeping are released. The hard drive also gave the location of the headquarters away, and Black Order soldiers land and attack. Deckard and all the Council soldiers get up onto the roof, where they wait for reinforcements from other parts of the world. Suddenly, a [[Kraken]] surfaces in the [[Thames]] and attacks. Firing several rockets down the Kraken's mouth, Deckard succeeds in killing the Kraken. While the Council was distracted, however, the Black Order manages to steal Pandora's Box, and kidnap Vivian Kane. Deckard and the Council chase after them back to New York City.\n\nIn New York City, Deckard and the Council launch a full-scale attack on the Black Order headquarters. Inside the building, he manages to free Vivian, and she goes up the command post to help Deckard. On the roof, Deckard finds the machine. It turns out that Deckard can overload the machine, and destroy it by putting a lot of Animus Energy inside of it. In the end, the machine overloads, and then explodes. LeFey is hurled out of his control booth by a [[werewolf]], grabbed in midair by a griffin and impaled on the machine, killing him. After the explosion, Vivian is nowhere to be seen. The Council arrives, and assumes that she was vaporized. The Council immediately turns on Deckard, locking him up, stating that Deckard's Signet contains information that could create a new Pandora's Box, the first one being destroyed when the machine exploded. Later, it turns out that Vivian survived, and Deckard, being a thief, easily escapes. A final picture shows Deckard holding his Signet branded hand out to a griffin, seemingly taming it.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| PC = true\n| PS3 = true\n| X360 = true\n| na = true\n| Edge_X360 = 4/10<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Legendary (X360) |author=Edge staff |magazine=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] |issue=195 |date=December 2008 |page=98}}</ref>\n| EuroG_X360 = 2/10<ref name=\"eurog\">{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/legendary-review |title=Legendary (Xbox 360) |last=Whitehead |first=Dan |date=October 31, 2008 |website=[[Eurogamer]] |accessdate=September 30, 2017}}</ref>\n| GI_PC = 6.5/10<ref name=\"gi\"/>\n| GI_PS3 = 6.5/10<ref name=\"gi\"/>\n| GI_X360 = 6.5/10<ref name=\"gi\">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/legendary/b/xbox360/archive/2009/09/22/review.aspx |title=Legendary: A Heavy Dose of Mythological Creatures Cannot Make Up for Lackluster Gunplay |last=Cork |first=Jeff |magazine=[[Game Informer]] |issue=189 |date=January 2009 |page=66 |accessdate=October 1, 2017}}</ref>\n| GameRev_X360 = D\u2212<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/42753-legendary-review |title=Legendary Review (X360) |last=Card |first=Ben |date=February 2, 2009 |publisher=[[Game Revolution]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911234507/http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/legendary-the-box |archivedate=September 11, 2015 |url-status=live |accessdate=October 1, 2017}}</ref>\n| GSpot_PC = 3.5/10<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/legendary-review/1900-6201614/ |title=Legendary Review (PC) |last=VanOrd |first=Kevin |date=November 24, 2008 |website=GameSpot |accessdate=October 1, 2017}}</ref>\n| GSpot_X360 = 3.5/10<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/legendary-review/1900-6200825/ |title=Legendary Review (X360) |last=VanOrd |first=Kevin |date=November 10, 2008 |website=GameSpot |accessdate=October 1, 2017}}</ref>\n| GameZone_PC = 5/10<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamezone.com/reviews/legendary_pc_review |title=Legendary - PC - Review |last=Lafferty |first=Michael |date=January 7, 2009 |publisher=GameZone |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116144537/http://pc.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r32990.htm |archivedate=January 16, 2009 |url-status=live |accessdate=October 1, 2017}}</ref>\n| GameZone_PS3 = 5.6/10<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamezone.com/reviews/legendary_ps3_review |title=Legendary - PS3 - Review |last=Myers |first=Dallas |date=December 15, 2008 |publisher=GameZone |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219140850/http://ps3.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r32990.htm |archivedate=December 19, 2008 |url-status=live |accessdate=October 1, 2017}}</ref>\n| GameZone_X360 = 7.5/10<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamezone.com/reviews/legendary_360_review |title=Legendary - 360 - Review |last=Platt |first=Dylan |date=January 1, 2009 |publisher=GameZone |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321110038/http://xbox360.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r32990.htm |archivedate=March 21, 2009 |url-status=live |accessdate=October 1, 2017}}</ref>\n| IGN_PC = 2.5/10<ref name=\"ignpcrev\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/12/05/legendary-review-2 |title=Legendary Review (PC) |last=Haynes |first=Jeff |date=December 5, 2008 |website=IGN |accessdate=September 30, 2017}}</ref>\n| IGN_PS3 = 2.3/10<ref name=\"ignps3rev\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/11/06/legendary-review-4 |title=Legendary Review (PS3) |last=Haynes |first=Jeff |date=November 6, 2008 |website=IGN |accessdate=September 30, 2017}}</ref>\n| IGN_X360 = 2.5/10<ref name=\"ignrev\"/>\n| OXM_X360 = 7.5/10<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.oxmonline.com/article/reviews/xbox-360/g-l/legendary |title=Legendary |last=McCaffrey |first=Ryan |magazine=[[Official Xbox Magazine]] |date=December 2008 |page=90 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119161729/http://www.oxmonline.com/article/reviews/xbox-360/g-l/legendary |archivedate=November 19, 2008 |url-status=dead |accessdate=September 30, 2017}}</ref>\n| PCGUK_PC = 40%<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Legendary |magazine=[[PC Gamer|PC Gamer UK]] |date=January 2009 |page=70}}</ref>\n| PSM_PS3 = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Review: Legendary |magazine=[[PlayStation: The Official Magazine]] |issue=14 |date=December 25, 2008 |page=88}}</ref>\n| rev1 = ''[[The A.V.
