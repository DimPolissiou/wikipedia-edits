The unveiling was performed by [[Ruth Madoc]], who was portraying the older Dorothy Squires in the play, ''Say It With Flowers'', by Meic Povey and Johnny Tudor.<ref>\n{{cite web| url=http://www.llanellistar.co.uk/Sir-Roger-pays-Dorothy-Squires-plaque/story-18914475-detail/story.html| title=Sir Roger pays for Dorothy Squires' plaque| publisher=Llanellistar.co.uk| accessdate=25 June 2013| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206193029/http://www.llanellistar.co.uk/Sir-Roger-pays-Dorothy-Squires-plaque/story-18914475-detail/story.html| archive-date=6 December 2013| url-status=live| df=dmy-all}}\n</ref> Following its premiere engagement at the Sherman Cymru Theatre, Cardiff, in 2013, the play toured across Wales.<ref>\n{{cite web| url=http://www.shermancymru.co.uk/performance/theatre/say-it-with-flowers/| title=Sherman Cymru \u2013 Say It With Flowers| publisher=ShermanCymru.co.uk/| accessdate=25 June 2013| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525113704/http://www.shermancymru.co.uk/performance/theatre/say-it-with-flowers/| archive-date=25 May 2013| url-status=live| df=dmy-all}}\n</ref> A previous staged tribute to her, ''Dorothy Squires: Mrs Roger Moore'', written by [[Richard Stirling]] and starring [[Al Pillay]] in the title role, had premiered at the [[White Bear Theatre]] in London on 6 June 2012, with a subsequent engagement at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] in August that year.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://westend.broadwayworld.com/article/BWW-Reviews-DOROTHY-SQUIRES-MRS-ROGER-MOORE-White-Bear-Theatre-June-7-2012-20120608| title=BWW Reviews: Dorothy Squires Mrs Roger Moore, White Bear Theatre, June 7, 2012| publisher=WestEnd.BroadwayWorld.com| accessdate=25 June 2013}}</ref> Welsh singer-songwriter [[Christopher Rees]] wrote a tribute song to Dorothy Squires, 'Alright Squires', which appeared on his 2013 album ''Stand Fast''.\n\n==Hit singles==\n*\"[[I'm Walking Behind You]]\" (1953) \u2013 [[UK Singles Chart|UK]] Number 12\n*\"Say It With Flowers\" (1961) \u2013 UK Number 23 (with [[Russ Conway]])\n*\"[[For Once in My Life]]\" (1969) \u2013 UK Number 24\n*\"[[Till (song)|Till]]\" (1970) \u2013 UK Number 25\n*\"[[My Way (song)|My Way]]\" (1970) \u2013 UK Number 25<ref name=\"The Virgin Encyclopedia of 50s Music\">{{cite book\n| first= Colin\n| last= Larkin\n| year= 2002\n| title= The Virgin Encyclopedia of 50s Music\n| edition= 1st\n| publisher= Virgin Books\n| location= London\n| isbn= 1-85227-937-0\n| page= 414}}</ref><ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book\n| first= David\n| last= Roberts\n| year= 2006\n| title= British Hit Singles & Albums\n| edition= 19th\n| publisher= Guinness World Records Limited \n| location= London\n| isbn= 1-904994-10-5\n| page= 523}}</ref>\n\n==Selected filmography==\n* ''[[Stars in Your Eyes]]'' (1956)\n\n==See also==\n*[[Polygon Records discography]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021215002034/http://home.wxs.nl/~bulteman/Squires/dorothy_squires.htm |date=15 December 2002 |title=The story of Dorothy Squires }}\n*[http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/music/sites/dorothy-squires/ Dorothy Squires biography from BBC Wales]\n*[http://www.webfantastic.co.uk/dorothybiography.html Webfantastic.co.uk biography]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100106125431/http://www.dorothysquires.co.uk/ Dorothy Squires homepage]\n*[http://www.llanellich.org.uk/Files/145-dorothy-squires3.html Dorothy Squires information and Blue Plaque from Llanelli Community Heritage]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Squires, Dorothy}}\n[[Category:1915 births]]\n[[Category:1998 deaths]]\n[[Category:Deaths from cancer in Wales]]\n[[Category:Deaths from lung cancer]]\n[[Category:Singers from Carmarthenshire]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Berkshire]]\n[[Category:Welsh female singers]]\n[[Category:Welsh nurses]]\n[[Category:20th-century Welsh singers]]\n[[Category:20th-century Welsh musicians]]\n[[Category:20th-century women singers]]\n[[Category:Vexatious litigants]]\n[[Category:Burials at Streatham Park Cemetery]]\n", "name_user": "Piggs mcginty", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eRoger Moore", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Squires"}

Those that feature in multiple episodes include:\n*{{anchor|Numberwang|numberwang}}'''''Numberwang''''': A \"maths quiz\" game show in which two contestants, Simon and Julie ([[Paterson Joseph]] and [[Olivia Colman]]), call out numbers until the host (Webb) declares \"That's Numberwang.\" The game goes through several rounds with varying formats, until the final round, titled \"Wangernumb\". Before the round, the host declares that it is time to \"rotate the board\"\u2014resulting in an interlude where the contestant area, which is on one side of a turntable, is spun in a full revolution to briefly reveal a [[Non sequitur (literary device)|non sequitur]] scene on the other side of the wall, before it returns to the first two. The game is almost consistently won by Simon, while the losing contestant suffers varying indignities such as being stuffed into a cardboard box or arrested by the police.<ref name=\"BBC - Numberwang\"/> One sketch features a variation known as ''Wordwang'' (\"the [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series with a difference, and that difference is words\"), and another features a German-language adaptation, ''N\u00fcmberwang'' (which is hosted by Mitchell).\n:The ''Numberwang'' episodes were only featured during series 1; series 2 featured other sketches themed around the show, such as a trailer for ''The Numberwang Code'' (a parody of ''[[The Da Vinci Code (film)|The Da Vinci Code]]''), as well as an advert for the show's home game (which includes a board, numbers, two 400-sided dice and a 37-volume rulebook), and a mockumentary on the show's history (which reveals that the show had aired since the 1950s, and that determining a Numberwang was an extremely complex process that was later simplified via the use of a robot known as Colosson, which had a habit of trying to take over the world).<ref name=\"BBC - Numberwang\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/thatmitchellandwebbsite/characters/numberwang.shtml |title=BBC - Comedy - That Mitchell And Webb Site - Numberwang |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2012-04-26}}</ref> What Numberwang actually means is never revealed.\n*'''Ted and Peter''': a pair of [[alcoholism|alcoholic]], chain-smoking [[snooker]] commentators and retired players. Ted Wilkes is played by David Mitchell and Peter DeCoursey by Robert Webb. They tell insensitive stories about the players, bringing up things such as one player's attempts at suicide, rather than focusing on the game (other than Ted's occasional comment of \"That's a bad miss!\"). They also drink heavily throughout the sketch. One sketch, purportedly a short documentary during an actual snooker broadcast introduced by [[Hazel Irvine]], features them reminiscing over a championship final they played which lasted several days since neither were sober enough to take a shot. By Series 4, the commentating careers of Ted and Peter have taken a downward turn, being forced to commentate on ''Late Night Dog Poker'' on [[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]].\n*'''Behind The Scenes''': a supposedly \"behind-the-scenes\" look at how the show is produced, starring Mitchell and Webb as reconstructed versions of themselves. Although ostensibly involved in the production of the programme, the pair are frequently drawn into furious arguments with one another, often playing on the perceived public personas of the pair; Mitchell being highly intelligent but socially inexperienced and Webb being confident and socially popular but lacking intelligence. \n*'''''The Surprising Adventures of Sir Digby Chicken Caesar''''': a drunken, drug-addled homeless man (Webb), who is under the delusion that he is a brilliant and intrepid detective or adventurer, dressed in a manner reminiscent of [[Sherlock Holmes]]. He and his companion Ginger (Mitchell) commit various crimes whilst supposedly engaging in battle against the henchmen of their so-called \"nemesis\". [[SnorriCam]] is used in parts of the sketches. The sketches usually include Sir Digby Chicken Caesar singing along, off-key and off-rhythm, to the tune of \"[[Devil's Galop]]\" from the BBC radio series ''[[Dick Barton]]'', often mid-escape from a potentially contentious situation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/thatmitchellandwebbsite/characters/sirdigby.shtml|title=Comedy > That Mitchell and Webb Site > Characters|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=24 September 2014|accessdate=24 July 2015}}</ref> In Series 3, there was an additional sketch where Ginger is run over by a car after being shoved onto the road by Sir Digby, which ended up with him being hospitalised and gaining a job working at a DIY shop, before Digby tricks him into redescending into alcoholism.\n*'''''Big Talk''''': a debate show hosted by the confrontational Raymond Terrific (Webb), who loudly bullies his panel of so-called \"[[boffins]]\" into giving yes or no answers to huge social and philosophical questions (''e.g.'', \"is there a god?\").\n*'''''The Quiz Broadcast''''': a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] television quiz show hosted by Mitchell (who constantly reminds viewers to \"remain indoors\") and transmitted by the British Emergency Broadcasting System. The show is being aired in the immediate years after \"The Event\", an unexplained disaster that left most of the human race dead, including all of the children. The sickly contestants on the show are survivors \"trying to enjoy themselves\" whilst avoiding any traumatic memories of \"the Event\"--Peter (a blind man played by Webb), Sheila, and Unknown Male 282. Prizes in the game consist of the sparse food and fuel supplies they have in their bunker. The questions asked often revolve around \"pre-Event\" subject matter, which the contestants have little to no knowledge of, while later sketches demonstrate the increasing deterioration of society, morale and health, and suggest that a cannibalistic race referred to as \"Them\" had overrun the area. The sketch ends on a somber note with Peter and the host being the last survivors of the bunker and possibly even the human race; Peter remains hopeful that help will come, but the host knows that it won't. In March 2020, 13 years after the original broadcast, these sketches and the 'Remain Indoors' banner in particular, began trending heavily on social media in light of the [[Coronavirus pandemic]] and the associated national lockdowns.<ref>https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tv/mitchell-webb-predicted-coronavirus-say-21744480</ref> \n*'''Friends Of...''': two housemates, played by Mitchell and Webb, discussing whom to invite to their next party \u2014 usually fictional characters or historical figures, whilst making snide remarks about said character's personality traits.\n*'''''The British Broadcasting Corporation''''': an old-fashioned black-and-white broadcast, set at a time when television is a very recent invention.\n*'''Barry Crisp''' (Mitchell) runs a range of unsafe attractions, such as charging \u00a32 to jump off a cliff. His customer (Webb) is oblivious to the obvious danger of these stunts and agrees to pay to take part in them, to Crisp's surprise.\n*'''The Honeymoon's Over''': Mitchell plays a rude, condescending, posh man who has replaced a staff member in various jobs (such as waiter or vicar). He angrily demeans his customers (Webb and Colman), trying to make them feel uncomfortable. Mitchell's characters personify less modern worldviews based on ideas of stricter social orders and less allowance for individuality, while those of Colman and Webb represent contemporary caricatures of casually interested neophytes.\n*'''''Get Me Hennimore!''''': a parody of 1970s sitcoms, each episode featuring the nervous Hennimore (Webb) being given two important tasks by his boss (Mitchell), which are easy to confuse: for instance, they may be based on two organisations with identical initials. The sketches always end with Hennimore mixing the tasks up and the boss shouting \"Hennimore!\" angrily and his glasses gratuitously breaking.  \n*'''''The Helivets''''': a sketch parodying TV shows that follow emergency services.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2007/12_december/19/mitchell_webb_episode.shtml|title=That Mitchell And Webb Look series two episodes|publisher=BBC Press Office|date=2007-12-19|accessdate=2007-12-27}}</ref> The Helivets claim they can rescue any pet in peril; however, the pets are all dead by the time they arrive.\n*'''Lazy Writers''': two script writers, John Gibson (Webb) and Andrew Turner (Mitchell) give an interview for their latest programme, which they did not bother to research. Short clips from the show \u2014 for instance, a hospital drama or court scene \u2014 are shown after the interview, featuring very simplistic dialog and obvious caricatures, one program being an unsubtle parody of [[Secret Diary of a Call Girl]].\n*'''Arguing Couple''': a couple who talk to their baby daughter in cutesy voices about the problems in their relationship, breaking off to snarl \"Up yours!\" at each other and make violent hand gestures. The couple and their daughter are played by Robert Webb and his real life wife and baby daughter.\n*'''Small Office''': Mitchell plays a boss who has conversations with his employees in his tiny office, which makes it difficult to discuss the matter in hand.\n*'''Didldidi''': a series of adverts promoting discounted but obviously disgusting or low-quality products being sold at the supermarket chain Didldidi, a parody of the German discount chain [[Lidl]] which was becoming increasingly popular amongst UK shoppers at the time.\n*'''A Prayer and a Pint''': a light religious show hosted by Donny Cosy (Mitchell), set in various, often exotic, locations such as [[CERN]] or [[Iran]]. Cosy gives a short description of the place he is in despite being clearly out of his depth, followed by him drinking a pint and singing a hymn requested by a viewer that is always the same; Phil and Meg McQueen from Silky Abbots in [[Sussex]], which Donny frequently humorously misreads as '[[anal sex|bumsex]]'.\n*'''Wacky History''': a wacky historian, an unsubtle parody of [[Adam Hart-Davis]] (Webb), tries to make history exciting through absurd, often unrelated props.\n*'''Sensitive Freak-shows''': fake adverts for various documentaries for [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]], which show people with ridiculous deformities including a boy with a posterior for a face. The narrator repeatedly comments that the documentary seems sad, but viewers only watch to laugh at the people with the absurd problems.\n*'''Unexplained Gestures''': a director struggles to film an actor who repeats odd gestures or out-of-context phrases without being aware of it.\n*'''Top Secret Government Conspiracies''': a series of sketches where three government agents discuss plans to carry out popular conspiracy theories \u2014 the [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales conspiracy theories|death of Princess Diana]], the [[Moon landing conspiracy theories|fake moon landings]] and the [[UFO conspiracy theory|suppression of alien contact]] \u2014 while inadvertently pointing out the flaws in such plans.\n*'''Colin and Ray''': Two men who work in a shared office space. Colin (Webb) is a hostage negotiator, while Ray (Mitchell) writes the scripts for pornographic movies. There is no particular theme to their sketches, and most of the humour is derived from their conversations, which are often laced with acerbic wit.\n\n==Production==\nThe show follows on from the duo's earlier TV series ''[[The Mitchell and Webb Situation]]'', and is an extension of their [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] sketch show ''[[That Mitchell and Webb Sound]]''. The show's producer Gareth Edwards commented that the show's pitch to the BBC \"was the shortest pitch I've ever written\", citing that the show \"has worked on the radio, just like ''[[Little Britain]]'' worked on the radio and ''[[Dead Ringers (comedy)|Dead Ringers]]'' worked on the radio, and they transferred successfully to TV, so why don't you [the BBC] transfer this one to TV as well?\"<ref name=observer/>\n\nA pilot for the show was filmed on 27 January 2006 at [[BBC Television Centre]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2005/11_november/24/mw.shtml|title=Mitchell and Webb bring {{sic|hide=y|critically|-}}acclaimed radio sketch show to BBC TWO|date=2006-11-24|accessdate=2007-04-11|publisher=BBC}}</ref> with a full series being later commissioned.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/08_august/29/mitchell_webb.shtml|title=That Mitchell & Webb Look Goes HD|date=2008-02-22|accessdate=2008-02-22 |publisher=BBC Resources}}</ref> Preview nights for the show were held at [[The Drill Hall]] in London on 11 January and 20 March 2006, and at Ginglik in [[Shepherd's Bush]] in London on 14 and 21 May 2006. These took the form of a radio recording, with verbal prompting to the audience for any visual element that would be required. The series was shot on location in June 2006 and three audience recording sessions were held in Studio 4 at BBC Television Centre on 14, 21 and 28 July 2006.\n\nFollowing the first series, the pair went on a tour of 44 UK venues between October and December 2006, entitled ''[[The Two Faces of Mitchell and Webb]]'', featuring many of the same sketches as ''That Mitchell and Webb Look''.\n\nA preview night for the second series was held on 18 May 2007 at The Drill Hall in London. This series was shot in [[high-definition television|high-definition]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbcresources.com/about/archive/240809_mitchell.html|title=Mitchell and Webb bring {{sic|hide=y|critically|-}}acclaimed radio sketch show to BBC TWO|date=2006-11-24|accessdate=2007-04-11|publisher=BBC}}</ref> on location during June/July 2007 and three studio recordings with an audience were held at TC8 in Television Centre on 3, 10 and 17 August 2007.\n\nTwo preview nights for series three were announced on 30 June 2008 on the BBC Tickets website; all tickets were booked in less than 24 hours. The first preview night took place on 13 July 2008 at The Drill Hall, with the second held there on 10 August 2008. Two audience recording sessions at Television Centre \u2014 with additional live sketches \u2014 were announced on 3 October 2008, and took place on 31 October and 7 November 2008, again in high-definition in studio TC8. A third recording session at the BBC Radio Theatre was announced on 10 October 2008, taking place on 18 November 2008.\n\nA preview night for the fourth series was announced on 18 November 2009 on the BBC Tickets website; this was held on 26 November 2009 at The Drill Hall.\n\n===Sketches===\nIn a 2020 podcast, David Mitchell, Jason Hazeley and Jonathan Dryden-Taylor discussed several of the series four sketches. The series had a bleaker tone, contributing factors potentially including the public mood in the aftermath of the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|2007\u201308 financial crash]], inspiration from the writers' upbringings during fears of [[nuclear warfare]], and an increase in the prominence of dramas at the time.<ref name=\"rule of three\">{{cite podcast |url=https://play.acast.com/s/ruleofthree/cb392fe6-93bf-4399-9100-cfd4d7775424 |title=Special: Remain Indoors (with David Mitchell & Jonathan Dryden-Taylor) |website=[[Acast]] |date=22 March 2020 }}</ref>\n\nA series of sketches labelled \"After the Event\" or \"Post-Apocalyptic Gameshow\", later to be known as \"Remain Indoors\", featured in three series three episodes and each of the six series four episodes. The last six episodes were devised in the writers' room and then written by Mitchell, Hazeley, Dryden-Taylor and Joel Morris, who divided into pairs who wrote three episodes apiece. Though Mitchell said he was uncomfortable with it in 2020, reference is made in the sketches to all the children having died in the apocalypse, an idea independently conceived by both pairs of writers.<ref name=\"rule of three\"/>\n\nMitchell's character's suit becomes increasingly damaged throughout the episodes. The character Sheila seems to believe that society will return to normal if people continue practising pre-Event routines in a ritualistic fashion, such as producing gameshows.

Those that feature in multiple episodes include:\n*{{anchor|Numberwang|numberwang}}'''''Numberwang''''': A \"maths quiz\" game show in which two contestants, Simon and Julie ([[Paterson Joseph]] and [[Olivia Colman]]), call out numbers until the host (Webb) declares \"That's Numberwang.\" The game goes through several rounds with varying formats, until the final round, titled \"Wangernumb\". Before the round, the host declares that it is time to \"rotate the board\"\u2014resulting in an interlude where the contestant area, which is on one side of a turntable, is spun in a full revolution to briefly reveal a [[Non sequitur (literary device)|non sequitur]] scene on the other side of the wall, before it returns to the first two. The game is almost consistently won by Simon, while the losing contestant suffers varying indignities such as being stuffed into a cardboard box or arrested by the police.<ref name=\"BBC - Numberwang\"/> One sketch features a variation known as ''Wordwang'' (\"the [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series with a difference, and that difference is words\"), and another features a German-language adaptation, ''N\u00fcmberwang'' (which is hosted by Mitchell).\n:The ''Numberwang'' episodes were only featured during series 1; series 2 featured other sketches themed around the show, such as a trailer for ''The Numberwang Code'' (a parody of ''[[The Da Vinci Code (film)|The Da Vinci Code]]''), as well as an advert for the show's home game (which includes a board, numbers, two 400-sided dice and a 37-volume rulebook), and a mockumentary on the show's history (which reveals that the show had aired since the 1950s, and that determining a Numberwang was an extremely complex process that was later simplified via the use of a robot known as Colosson, which had a habit of trying to take over the world).<ref name=\"BBC - Numberwang\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/thatmitchellandwebbsite/characters/numberwang.shtml |title=BBC - Comedy - That Mitchell And Webb Site - Numberwang |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2012-04-26}}</ref> What Numberwang actually means is never revealed.\n*'''Ted and Peter''': a pair of [[alcoholism|alcoholic]], chain-smoking [[snooker]] commentators and retired players. Ted Wilkes is played by David Mitchell and Peter DeCoursey by Robert Webb. They tell insensitive stories about the players, bringing up things such as one player's attempts at suicide, rather than focusing on the game (other than Ted's occasional comment of \"That's a bad miss!\"). They also drink heavily throughout the sketch. One sketch, purportedly a short documentary during an actual snooker broadcast introduced by [[Hazel Irvine]], features them reminiscing over a championship final they played which lasted several days since neither were sober enough to take a shot. By Series 4, the commentating careers of Ted and Peter have taken a downward turn, being forced to commentate on ''Late Night Dog Poker'' on [[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]].\n*'''Behind The Scenes''': a supposedly \"behind-the-scenes\" look at how the show is produced, starring Mitchell and Webb as reconstructed versions of themselves. Although ostensibly involved in the production of the programme, the pair are frequently drawn into furious arguments with one another, often playing on the perceived public personas of the pair; Mitchell being highly intelligent but socially inexperienced and Webb being confident and socially popular but lacking intelligence. \n*'''''The Surprising Adventures of Sir Digby Chicken Caesar''''': a drunken, drug-addled homeless man (Webb), who is under the delusion that he is a brilliant and intrepid detective or adventurer, dressed in a manner reminiscent of [[Sherlock Holmes]]. He and his companion Ginger (Mitchell) commit various crimes whilst supposedly engaging in battle against the henchmen of their so-called \"nemesis\". [[SnorriCam]] is used in parts of the sketches. The sketches usually include Sir Digby Chicken Caesar singing along, off-key and off-rhythm, to the tune of \"[[Devil's Galop]]\" from the BBC radio series ''[[Dick Barton]]'', often mid-escape from a potentially contentious situation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/thatmitchellandwebbsite/characters/sirdigby.shtml|title=Comedy > That Mitchell and Webb Site > Characters|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=24 September 2014|accessdate=24 July 2015}}</ref> In Series 3, there was an additional sketch where Ginger is run over by a car after being shoved onto the road by Sir Digby, which ended up with him being hospitalised and gaining a job working at a DIY shop.\n*'''''Big Talk''''': a debate show hosted by the confrontational Raymond Terrific (Webb), who loudly bullies his panel of so-called \"[[boffins]]\" into giving yes or no answers to huge social and philosophical questions (''e.g.'', \"is there a god?\").\n*'''''The Quiz Broadcast''''': a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] television quiz show hosted by Mitchell (who constantly reminds viewers to \"remain indoors\") and transmitted by the British Emergency Broadcasting System. The show is being aired in the immediate years after \"The Event\", an unexplained disaster that left most of the human race dead, including all of the children. The sickly contestants on the show are survivors \"trying to enjoy themselves\" whilst avoiding any traumatic memories of \"the Event\"--Peter (a blind man played by Webb), Sheila, and Unknown Male 282. Prizes in the game consist of the sparse food and fuel supplies they have in their bunker. The questions asked often revolve around \"pre-Event\" subject matter, which the contestants have little to no knowledge of, while later sketches demonstrate the increasing deterioration of society, morale and health, and suggest that a cannibalistic race referred to as \"Them\" had overrun the area. The sketch ends on a somber note with Peter and the host being the last survivors of the bunker and possibly even the human race; Peter remains hopeful that help will come, but the host knows that it won't. In March 2020, 13 years after the original broadcast, these sketches and the 'Remain Indoors' banner in particular, began trending heavily on social media in light of the [[Coronavirus pandemic]] and the associated national lockdowns.<ref>https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tv/mitchell-webb-predicted-coronavirus-say-21744480</ref> \n*'''Friends Of...''': two housemates, played by Mitchell and Webb, discussing whom to invite to their next party \u2014 usually fictional characters or historical figures, whilst making snide remarks about said character's personality traits.\n*'''''The British Broadcasting Corporation''''': an old-fashioned black-and-white broadcast, set at a time when television is a very recent invention.\n*'''Barry Crisp''' (Mitchell) runs a range of unsafe attractions, such as charging \u00a32 to jump off a cliff. His customer (Webb) is oblivious to the obvious danger of these stunts and agrees to pay to take part in them, to Crisp's surprise.\n*'''The Honeymoon's Over''': Mitchell plays a rude, condescending, posh man who has replaced a staff member in various jobs (such as waiter or vicar). He angrily demeans his customers (Webb and Colman), trying to make them feel uncomfortable. Mitchell's characters personify less modern worldviews based on ideas of stricter social orders and less allowance for individuality, while those of Colman and Webb represent contemporary caricatures of casually interested neophytes.\n*'''''Get Me Hennimore!''''': a parody of 1970s sitcoms, each episode featuring the nervous Hennimore (Webb) being given two important tasks by his boss (Mitchell), which are easy to confuse: for instance, they may be based on two organisations with identical initials. The sketches always end with Hennimore mixing the tasks up and the boss shouting \"Hennimore!\" angrily and his glasses gratuitously breaking.  \n*'''''The Helivets''''': a sketch parodying TV shows that follow emergency services.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2007/12_december/19/mitchell_webb_episode.shtml|title=That Mitchell And Webb Look series two episodes|publisher=BBC Press Office|date=2007-12-19|accessdate=2007-12-27}}</ref> The Helivets claim they can rescue any pet in peril; however, the pets are all dead by the time they arrive.\n*'''Lazy Writers''': two script writers, John Gibson (Webb) and Andrew Turner (Mitchell) give an interview for their latest programme, which they did not bother to research. Short clips from the show \u2014 for instance, a hospital drama or court scene \u2014 are shown after the interview, featuring very simplistic dialog and obvious caricatures, one program being an unsubtle parody of [[Secret Diary of a Call Girl]].\n*'''Arguing Couple''': a couple who talk to their baby daughter in cutesy voices about the problems in their relationship, breaking off to snarl \"Up yours!\" at each other and make violent hand gestures. The couple and their daughter are played by Robert Webb and his real life wife and baby daughter.\n*'''Small Office''': Mitchell plays a boss who has conversations with his employees in his tiny office, which makes it difficult to discuss the matter in hand.\n*'''Didldidi''': a series of adverts promoting discounted but obviously disgusting or low-quality products being sold at the supermarket chain Didldidi, a parody of the German discount chain [[Lidl]] which was becoming increasingly popular amongst UK shoppers at the time.\n*'''A Prayer and a Pint''': a light religious show hosted by Donny Cosy (Mitchell), set in various, often exotic, locations such as [[CERN]] or [[Iran]]. Cosy gives a short description of the place he is in despite being clearly out of his depth, followed by him drinking a pint and singing a hymn requested by a viewer that is always the same; Phil and Meg McQueen from Silky Abbots in [[Sussex]], which Donny frequently humorously misreads as '[[anal sex|bumsex]]'.\n*'''Wacky History''': a wacky historian, an unsubtle parody of [[Adam Hart-Davis]] (Webb), tries to make history exciting through absurd, often unrelated props.\n*'''Sensitive Freak-shows''': fake adverts for various documentaries for [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]], which show people with ridiculous deformities including a boy with a posterior for a face. The narrator repeatedly comments that the documentary seems sad, but viewers only watch to laugh at the people with the absurd problems.\n*'''Unexplained Gestures''': a director struggles to film an actor who repeats odd gestures or out-of-context phrases without being aware of it.\n*'''Top Secret Government Conspiracies''': a series of sketches where three government agents discuss plans to carry out popular conspiracy theories \u2014 the [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales conspiracy theories|death of Princess Diana]], the [[Moon landing conspiracy theories|fake moon landings]] and the [[UFO conspiracy theory|suppression of alien contact]] \u2014 while inadvertently pointing out the flaws in such plans.\n*'''Colin and Ray''': Two men who work in a shared office space. Colin (Webb) is a hostage negotiator, while Ray (Mitchell) writes the scripts for pornographic movies. There is no particular theme to their sketches, and most of the humour is derived from their conversations, which are often laced with acerbic wit.\n\n==Production==\nThe show follows on from the duo's earlier TV series ''[[The Mitchell and Webb Situation]]'', and is an extension of their [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] sketch show ''[[That Mitchell and Webb Sound]]''. The show's producer Gareth Edwards commented that the show's pitch to the BBC \"was the shortest pitch I've ever written\", citing that the show \"has worked on the radio, just like ''[[Little Britain]]'' worked on the radio and ''[[Dead Ringers (comedy)|Dead Ringers]]'' worked on the radio, and they transferred successfully to TV, so why don't you [the BBC] transfer this one to TV as well?\"<ref name=observer/>\n\nA pilot for the show was filmed on 27 January 2006 at [[BBC Television Centre]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2005/11_november/24/mw.shtml|title=Mitchell and Webb bring {{sic|hide=y|critically|-}}acclaimed radio sketch show to BBC TWO|date=2006-11-24|accessdate=2007-04-11|publisher=BBC}}</ref> with a full series being later commissioned.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/08_august/29/mitchell_webb.shtml|title=That Mitchell & Webb Look Goes HD|date=2008-02-22|accessdate=2008-02-22 |publisher=BBC Resources}}</ref> Preview nights for the show were held at [[The Drill Hall]] in London on 11 January and 20 March 2006, and at Ginglik in [[Shepherd's Bush]] in London on 14 and 21 May 2006. These took the form of a radio recording, with verbal prompting to the audience for any visual element that would be required. The series was shot on location in June 2006 and three audience recording sessions were held in Studio 4 at BBC Television Centre on 14, 21 and 28 July 2006.\n\nFollowing the first series, the pair went on a tour of 44 UK venues between October and December 2006, entitled ''[[The Two Faces of Mitchell and Webb]]'', featuring many of the same sketches as ''That Mitchell and Webb Look''.\n\nA preview night for the second series was held on 18 May 2007 at The Drill Hall in London. This series was shot in [[high-definition television|high-definition]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbcresources.com/about/archive/240809_mitchell.html|title=Mitchell and Webb bring {{sic|hide=y|critically|-}}acclaimed radio sketch show to BBC TWO|date=2006-11-24|accessdate=2007-04-11|publisher=BBC}}</ref> on location during June/July 2007 and three studio recordings with an audience were held at TC8 in Television Centre on 3, 10 and 17 August 2007.\n\nTwo preview nights for series three were announced on 30 June 2008 on the BBC Tickets website; all tickets were booked in less than 24 hours. The first preview night took place on 13 July 2008 at The Drill Hall, with the second held there on 10 August 2008. Two audience recording sessions at Television Centre \u2014 with additional live sketches \u2014 were announced on 3 October 2008, and took place on 31 October and 7 November 2008, again in high-definition in studio TC8. A third recording session at the BBC Radio Theatre was announced on 10 October 2008, taking place on 18 November 2008.\n\nA preview night for the fourth series was announced on 18 November 2009 on the BBC Tickets website; this was held on 26 November 2009 at The Drill Hall.\n\n===Sketches===\nIn a 2020 podcast, David Mitchell, Jason Hazeley and Jonathan Dryden-Taylor discussed several of the series four sketches. The series had a bleaker tone, contributing factors potentially including the public mood in the aftermath of the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|2007\u201308 financial crash]], inspiration from the writers' upbringings during fears of [[nuclear warfare]], and an increase in the prominence of dramas at the time.<ref name=\"rule of three\">{{cite podcast |url=https://play.acast.com/s/ruleofthree/cb392fe6-93bf-4399-9100-cfd4d7775424 |title=Special: Remain Indoors (with David Mitchell & Jonathan Dryden-Taylor) |website=[[Acast]] |date=22 March 2020 }}</ref>\n\nA series of sketches labelled \"After the Event\" or \"Post-Apocalyptic Gameshow\", later to be known as \"Remain Indoors\", featured in three series three episodes and each of the six series four episodes. The last six episodes were devised in the writers' room and then written by Mitchell, Hazeley, Dryden-Taylor and Joel Morris, who divided into pairs who wrote three episodes apiece. Though Mitchell said he was uncomfortable with it in 2020, reference is made in the sketches to all the children having died in the apocalypse, an idea independently conceived by both pairs of writers.<ref name=\"rule of three\"/>\n\nMitchell's character's suit becomes increasingly damaged throughout the episodes. The character Sheila seems to believe that society will return to normal if people continue practising pre-Event routines in a ritualistic fashion, such as producing gameshows. Mitchell linked this to another sketch conceived by the writers in which inhabitants of [[Pompeii]] begin to frantically recycle after the nearby volcano erupts.<ref name=\"rule of three\"/>\n\nAnother sketch about a spaceship employee who returns from a sick day to find all of his colleagues involved in a religion referencing a deity Vectron was taken from an occurrence during the writing process.
