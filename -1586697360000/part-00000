He gets Kavitha married in a good family. Shiva manages to become a [[sub-inspector]]. On seeing Manikam's photo, [[Deputy inspector general of police|DIG]] Dinakar who interviewed Shiva wants to meet Manikam. Manikam hesitatingly comes to meet Dinakar in his office. Dinakar is reminded of a don on seeing Manikam. Geetha gets admission in a medical college, but the chairman asks for her carnal company in return for a seat. Manikam interferes and discloses that his name is \"Baasha\", after which the scared chairman unconditionally gives Geetha a seat.\n\nMeanwhile, Priya, the only daughter of a businessman Kesavan, travels in Manikam's auto frequently and develops a liking towards him seeing his good character. Priya discovers that her father is a smuggler and decides to maintain a distance with him. Priya proposes her love to Manikam but Manikam does not accept at first as he knows that she is the daughter of Kesavan (with whom Manikam has some issues). But later accepts her love.\n\nIndiran is a gangster who uses his henchmen to collect \"commission\" from all business owners. When Shiva beats two of Indiran's henchmen who attacked a man for not being able to pay commission; Indiran arrives and tells Shiva that he runs that area and his laws apply. Shiva's and Indiran's fight is stopped by Manikam, who requests Indiran to beat him and spare Shiva. Manikam is tied to a pole and is severely beaten by Indiran and his men, but Manikam bears it for the sake of his brother without any retaliation.\n\nLater Shiva again takes action against Indiran by submitting an arrest warrant which makes him furious again. This time after his release from jail, Indiran kidnaps Geetha and tries to molest her in front of the public. To everyone's surprise, Manikam finally snaps and hits back Indiran and his men, thereby saving his sister. The beating of Indiran and his henchmen was so severe that it shocked Shiva and he asks about Manikam's past lifestyle in Mumbai when they were young.\n\nIn a flashback, Manikam lives with his family in Mumbai while his siblings are young and studying in Chennai. Manikam's father Rangasamy is an honest man but employed with gangster Mark Antony. This is because Antony helped Rangasamy during initial days, and Rangasamy in turn decided to stay loyal to Antony for life. Manickam and his friend Anwar Baasha protest against the ridiculous behaviours of Antony's men, prompting Antony to kill Anwar; Manikam is spared as he is Rangasamy's son. He decides to take the same path to destroy Antony and kills Antony's hitmen to avenge Anwar's death.\n\nManikam gets the support of local people in Mumbai who feared for Antony. Manikam transforms into a gangster named \"Manick Baasha\" and frequently interferes in Antony's activities which create enmity between the two. Baasha's command over the city increases and Antony decides to kill Baasha. But Baasha escapes from Antony's plan. Enraged, Antony kills Rangasamy. Before dying, Rangasamy requests Baasha to return to Chennai and start a new peaceful life. Baasha fakes his death and secretly leaves to Chennai along with his mother where he starts a new life as Manikam, an auto-driver. Antony gets arrested; meanwhile, Kesavan kills Antony's family and steals his wealth.\n\nIn the present, Kesavan arranges Priya's wedding against her wishes. Manikam comes to the wedding hall and Kesavan is shocked to see Baasha alive in the form of Manikam. Frightened, he permits Priya to go along with Manikam. On learning that Baasha is alive, Antony escapes from prison and comes to take revenge. First, he kills Kesavan for betraying him. He also kidnaps Manikam's family members and threatens Manikam to surrender to him failing which his family members will be killed. Manikam rushes to the spot and he fights against Antony and saves his family. Antony then tries to shoot Manikam, but is shot dead by Shiva from behind.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Rajinikanth]] as Manikkam / Manik Baashha\n* [[Nagma]] as Priya<ref name=\"birthday special\" />\n* [[Raghuvaran]] as Mark Anthony<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.newstodaynet.com/index.php/2017/11/11/a-film-tribute-to-late-actor-raghuvaran/ |title=A film tribute to late actor Raghuvaran |date=11 November 2017 |work=[[The News Today (India)|The News Today]] |access-date=6 May 2018 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171111213440/https://www.newstodaynet.com/index.php/2017/11/11/a-film-tribute-to-late-actor-raghuvaran/ |archive-date=11 November 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Janagaraj]] as Murthy{{sfn|Ramachandran|2014|p=158}}\n* [[Devan (actor)|Devan]] as Kesavan<ref name=\"birthday special\" />\n* [[Shashi Kumar]] as Shiva<ref name=\"dinamalarnellai\">{{Cite news |url=http://www.dinamalarnellai.com/web/news/6953 |title=\u0b9a\u0bbe\u0ba4\u0ba9\u0bc8 \u0baa\u0bc1\u0bb0\u0bbf\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4 \u0ba4\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0bcd\u0baa\u0b9f\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bcd \u2013 242 \u2013\u0b8e\u0bb8\u0bcd.\u0b95\u0ba3\u0bc7\u0bb7\u0bcd |date=26 April 2016 |work=[[Dinamalar]] |access-date=2 March 2020}}</ref>\n* [[Vijayakumar (actor)|Vijayakumar]] as Rangasamy<ref name=\"birthday special\" />\n* [[Anandaraj]] as Indiran(Guest Appearence)<ref name=\"birthday special\" />\n* [[Charan Raj]] as Anwar Baashha<ref name=\"birthday special\" />\n* [[Kitty (actor)|Kitty]] as [[Deputy inspector general of police|DIG]] Dinakar<ref name=\"birthday special\" />\n* [[Sathyapriya]] as <!-- Vijayalakshmi -->Manikkam's mother<ref>{{Cite news |last=Anantharam |first=Chitradeepa |url=https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/baashas-amma-returns/article17415818.ece |title=Baasha\u2019s amma returns |date=6 March 2017 |work=[[The Hindu]] |access-date=2 March 2020 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200302113610/https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/baashas-amma-returns/article17415818.ece |archive-date=2 March 2020}}</ref>\n* [[Shenbaga]] as Kavitha<ref name=\"dinamalarnellai\" />\n* [[Yuvarani]] as Geetha<ref name=\"dinamalarnellai\" />\n<!-- * [[Thalapathy Dinesh]] as Manik Baashha's henchman\n* [[Mahanadi Shankar]] as Manik Baashha's henchman\n* Jayaprakasam as Manik Baashha's henchman\n* Daljith Singh as Manik Baashha's henchman\n* [[Kavithalaya Krishnan]] as Krishnan\n* [[Dhamu]] as Dhamu\n* Rajeshkumar as Kesavan's henchman\n* [[Narsing Yadav]] as Mark Anthony's henchman\n* Joseph as Albert, Mark Anthony's henchman\n* Vittal Rao as Kavitha's father-in-law -->\n* [[Sethu Vinayagam]] as the college chairman{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|p=185}}\n* [[Hemalatha]] as Mark Anthony's daughter<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://tamil.asianetnews.com/cinema/suriyavamsam-child-artist-baby-hemalatha-latest-photo-pwmukt |title=\u0b9a\u0bc2\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0baf \u0bb5\u0bae\u0bcd\u0b9a\u0bae\u0bcd \u0baa\u0b9f\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bbf\u0bb2\u0bcd \u0b9a\u0bb0\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bbe\u0bb0\u0bcd \u0bae\u0b95\u0ba9\u0bbe\u0b95 \u0ba8\u0b9f\u0bbf\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4 \u0bb9\u0bc7\u0bae\u0bb2\u0ba4\u0bbe \u0b87\u0ba9\u0bcd\u0bb1\u0bc1 \u0bb5\u0bb3\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4 \u0bae\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc8\u0baf\u0bbe\u0baf\u0bcd...! |date=22 August 2019 |work=[[Asianet News]] |access-date=2 March 2020 |url-status=live |language=ta}}</ref>\n{{colend}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\nDuring the making of ''[[Hum (film)|Hum]]'' (1991), its director [[Mukul S.

The title ''Baashha'' was suggested by Rajinikanth to Krissna, who suggested to Rajinikanth that a Muslim connection to the script was needed. Krissna brought up the subject again to Rajinikanth during the making of ''[[Veera (1994 film)|Veera]]'' (1994), but Rajinikanth wanted to discuss the script only after completing ''Veera''.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|p=134}} The discarded scene became the foundation for ''Baashha'' where Rajinikanth's character in the film, Manikkam, helps his sister get admission in the medical college she had applied for.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|pp=132\u2013133}} Krissna planned to weave the rest of the film's story around the scene.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|p=133}} Though Manikkam was initially considered to be written as a bus conductor, the \"auto driver was the commonest man around.

He then thought Raghuvaran would be a good fit, considering his tall height and deep voice. Rajinikanth also readily agreed to this proposal. Krissna met Raghuvaran at his residence and explained about the role.

Fans of Rajinikanth were invited for the shot.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|page=146}} Choreography for the song \"Naan Autokaaran\" was done by Tarun Kumar, whose father, Hiralal, choreographed the song \"Yaaradi Nee Mohini\" from ''[[Uthama Puthiran (1958 film)|Uthama Puthiran]]'' (1958).{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|page=140}} Rajinikanth recommended Tarun to Krissna, who had initially wanted [[Raghuram]] to choreograph the song. Tarun completed the choreography in five days and the entire sequence was rehearsed at AVM Studios with fifty back-up dancers.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|page=141}} As in the song \"Vandhenda Paalakaaran\" from ''Annamalai'', the sequence was shot with Rajinikanth looking into the lens with a smile, which was intended to make the audience feel that he was looking directly at them and then putting his hands together to greet them. The gesture, which was already effective in ''Annamalai'', prompted Krissna to extend the screen time of the shot.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|page=142}} Krissna wanted Rajinikanth to sport a dress that would make Rajinikanth look slightly unkempt in appearance, but Rajinikanth finished the sequence in a smartly-tailored uniform and said to Krissna that the audience would not find it odd. The filming of the song took place at the open space at [[Vijaya Vauhini Studios]] in Chennai, the same area where Hotel Green Park is present;{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|page=143}} the song was completed with a hundred back-up dancers used for it in four days.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|page=145}} Choreographers Kalyan and Ashok Raj were part of the back-up dancers for the song.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|page=144}}\n\nIn one of the action sequences involving the protagonist in a face-off against the antagonist's henchmen, the iconic dialogue ''Naan oru thadava sonna, nooru thadava sonna madhiri.'' (English: ''Saying it once is equal to my saying it a hundred times.'') The first half of the film was shot for twenty-three days at a stretch.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|page=146}} Regarding the dialogue's development, Rajinikanth said to the film's dialogue writer, Balakumaran, that the dialogue had to be simple yet effective, as it would be used in a sequence where another side of the protagonist was revealed.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|page=147}} On the day when the sequence which featured the dialogue was to be shot, Rajinikanth came up with the dialogue, which was originally spoken by him as ''Naan oru vaatti sonna, nooru vaatti sonna madhiri.'', which impressed Balakumaran and Krissna. Before the take, Rajinikanth, who repeatedly rehearsed the dialogue, told Krissna that the word \"thadava\" sounded more effective than \"vaatti\", and suggested Krissna use \"thadava\" instead of \"vaatti\".{{efn|\"vaatti\" is a synonym of \"thadava\".{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|page=148}}}} Balakumaran initially did not agree with Rajinikanth and Krissna as he felt that the word \"vaatti\" was \"fine\" and that there was no need to change the dialogue.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|page=148}} Rajinikanth then spoke both the versions of the dialogue and convinced Balakumaran to change the word \"vaatti\" to \"thadava\".{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|page=149}} The dialogue had such an impact on everyone present at the set that, in the break that followed, everyone started using it one way or another. The dialogues occur only five times in the film.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|page=149}} According to ''[[The Times of India]]''{{'}}s Sunanya Suresh, it was potentially inspired by a line in [[Jane Austen]]'s novel ''[[Emma (novel)|Emma]]'', which read, \"If I've told you once, I've told you a 100 times.\"<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Rajinis-punch-dialogue-inspired-by-Jane-Austen-novel/articleshow/20312093.cms |title=Rajini's punch dialogue inspired by Jane Austen novel? |last=Suresh |first=Sunayana |date=29 May 2013 |work=[[The Times of India]] |access-date=25 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911055411/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Rajinis-punch-dialogue-inspired-by-Jane-Austen-novel/articleshow/20312093.cms |archive-date=11 September 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The scene where Rajinikanth's character, Manikkam, gets beaten up to protect his sibling and the following sequence where he beats up the antagonist in turn, was suggested to Krissna by Raju, the choreographer for both the stunt sequences.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|page=150}}\n\nRamalingam, the son of R. M. Veerappan, informed Krissna that Veerappan wanted to meet him. Krissna had finished shooting the sequence where Manikkam gets beaten up after trying to protect his younger brother. When Veerappan enquired Krissna about how the film was shaping up, Krissna spoke about the scene which he had shot before his meeting with Veerappan. Veerappan wanted the scene to be deleted from the film as he felt that people would not want to see an actor like Rajinikanth getting beaten up.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|page=150}} Rajinikanth offered to show a sneak preview of the film to Veerappan on 15 December 1994, and if Veerappan did not want the scene to be in the film, the scene would be re-shot, and Rajinikanth offered to bear the costs for re-shooting the scene himself.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|page=151}} The shooting was stalled for five days after Krissna's meeting with Veerappan. Later, Krissna, Raju, the choreographer for the stunt sequence, and cameraman Prakash concluded that the scene would be tweaked in such a way that it would be as if [[Mother Nature]] is angry at the treatment being meted out to a peace-loving person like Manikkam; it was also planned that backlighting and a poignant [[background music]] would be used as well.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|page=152}}\n\nTwenty-five scenes, including those which show Rajinikanth's house and neighborhood were shot at Vijaya Vauhini Studios.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|page=144}} The set at the studio was designed by Magie, the film's art director.

A digitally restored version of the film was released on 3 March 2017.\n\n== Plot ==\nManikam is a humble [[auto rickshaw|auto]]-driver who lives with his mother, brother Shiva, and sisters Geetha and Kavitha, and would go to any extent for their well-being. He gets Kavitha married in a good family. Shiva manages to become a [[sub-inspector]]. On seeing Manikam's photo, [[Deputy inspector general of police|DIG]] Dinakar who interviewed Shiva wants to meet Manikam. Manikam hesitatingly comes to meet Dinakar in his office. Dinakar is reminded of a don on seeing Manikam. Geetha gets admission in a medical college, but the chairman asks for her carnal company in return for a seat. Manikam interferes and discloses that his name is \"Baasha\", after which the scared chairman unconditionally gives Geetha a seat.\n\nMeanwhile, Priya, the only daughter of a businessman Kesavan, travels in Manikam's auto frequently and develops a liking towards him seeing his good character. Priya discovers that her father is a smuggler and decides to maintain a distance with him. Priya proposes her love to Manikam but Manikam does not accept at first as he knows that she is the daughter of Kesavan (with whom Manikam has some issues). But later accepts her love.\n\nIndiran is a gangster who uses his henchmen to collect \"commission\" from all business owners. When Shiva beats two of Indiran's henchmen who attacked a man for not being able to pay commission; Indiran arrives and tells Shiva that he runs that area and his laws apply. Shiva's and Indiran's fight is stopped by Manikam, who requests Indiran to beat him and spare Shiva. Manikam is tied to a pole and is severely beaten by Indiran and his men, but Manikam bears it for the sake of his brother without any retaliation.\n\nLater Shiva again takes action against Indiran by submitting an arrest warrant which makes him furious again. This time after his release from jail, Indiran kidnaps Geetha and tries to molest her in front of the public. To everyone's surprise, Manikam finally snaps and hits back Indiran and his men, thereby saving his sister. The beating of Indiran and his henchmen was so severe that it shocked Shiva and he asks about Manikam's past lifestyle in Mumbai when they were young.\n\nIn a flashback, Manikam lives with his family in Mumbai while his siblings are young and studying in Chennai. Manikam's father Rangasamy is an honest man but employed with gangster Mark Antony. This is because Antony helped Rangasamy during initial days, and Rangasamy in turn decided to stay loyal to Antony for life. Manickam and his friend Anwar Baasha protest against the ridiculous behaviours of Antony's men, prompting Antony to kill Anwar; Manikam is spared as he is Rangasamy's son. He decides to take the same path to destroy Antony and kills Antony's hitmen to avenge Anwar's death.\n\nManikam gets the support of local people in Mumbai who feared for Antony. Manikam transforms into a gangster named \"Manick Baasha\" and frequently interferes in Antony's activities which create enmity between the two. Baasha's command over the city increases and Antony decides to kill Baasha. But Baasha escapes from Antony's plan. Enraged, Antony kills Rangasamy. Before dying, Rangasamy requests Baasha to return to Chennai and start a new peaceful life. Baasha fakes his death and secretly leaves to Chennai along with his mother where he starts a new life as Manikam, an auto-driver. Antony gets arrested; meanwhile, Kesavan kills Antony's family and steals his wealth.\n\nIn the present, Kesavan arranges Priya's wedding against her wishes. Manikam comes to the wedding hall and Kesavan is shocked to see Baasha alive in the form of Manikam. Frightened, he permits Priya to go along with Manikam. On learning that Baasha is alive, Antony escapes from prison and comes to take revenge. First, he kills Kesavan for betraying him.

The title ''Baashha'' was suggested by Rajinikanth to Krissna, who suggested to Rajinikanth that a Muslim connection to the script was needed. Krissna brought up the subject again to Rajinikanth during the making of ''[[Veera (1994 film)|Veera]]'' (1994), but Rajinikanth wanted to discuss the script only after completing ''Veera''.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|p=134}} The discarded scene became the foundation for ''Baashha'' where Rajinikanth's character in the film, Manikkam, helps his sister get admission in the medical college she had applied for.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|pp=132\u2013133}} Krissna planned to weave the rest of the film's story around the scene.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|p=133}} Though Manikkam was initially considered to be written as a bus conductor, the \"auto driver was the commonest man around.

Eighty percent of the script, including the flashback portions of Rajinikanth as Baashha, were ready in ten days.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|p=135}} [[Balakumaran]] was selected to write the film's dialogues. The entire team of technicians, including music director [[Deva (composer)|Deva]], who had worked with Krissna in ''Annaamalai'', returned to work with him for ''Baashha''.

He then thought Raghuvaran would be a good fit, considering his tall height and deep voice. Rajinikanth also readily agreed to this proposal. Krissna met Raghuvaran at his residence and explained about the role.

Fans of Rajinikanth were invited for the shot.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|page=146}} Choreography for the song \"Naan Autokaaran\" was done by Tarun Kumar, whose father, Hiralal, choreographed the song \"Yaaradi Nee Mohini\" from ''[[Uthama Puthiran (1958 film)|Uthama Puthiran]]'' (1958).{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|page=140}} Rajinikanth recommended Tarun to Krissna, who had initially wanted [[Raghuram]] to choreograph the song. Tarun completed the choreography in five days and the entire sequence was rehearsed at AVM Studios with fifty back-up dancers.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|page=141}} As in the song \"Vandhenda Paalakaaran\" from ''Annamalai'', the sequence was shot with Rajinikanth looking into the lens with a smile, which was intended to make the audience feel that he was looking directly at them and then putting his hands together to greet them. The gesture, which was already effective in ''Annamalai'', prompted Krissna to extend the screen time of the shot.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|page=142}} Krissna wanted Rajinikanth to sport a dress that would make Rajinikanth look slightly unkempt in appearance, but Rajinikanth finished the sequence in a smartly-tailored uniform and said to Krissna that the audience would not find it odd. The filming of the song took place at the open space at [[Vijaya Vauhini Studios]] in Chennai, the same area where Hotel Green Park is present;{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|page=143}} the song was completed with a hundred back-up dancers used for it in four days.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|page=145}} Choreographers Kalyan and Ashok Raj were part of the back-up dancers for the song.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|page=144}}\n\nIn one of the action sequences involving the protagonist in a face-off against the antagonist's henchmen, the iconic dialogue ''Naan oru thadava sonna, nooru thadava sonna madhiri.'' (English: ''Saying it once is equal to my saying it a hundred times.'') The first half of the film was shot for twenty-three days at a stretch.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|page=146}} Regarding the dialogue's development, Rajinikanth said to the film's dialogue writer, Balakumaran, that the dialogue had to be simple yet effective, as it would be used in a sequence where another side of the protagonist was revealed.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|page=147}} On the day when the sequence which featured the dialogue was to be shot, Rajinikanth came up with the dialogue, which was originally spoken by him as ''Naan oru vaatti sonna, nooru vaatti sonna madhiri.'', which impressed Balakumaran and Krissna. Before the take, Rajinikanth, who repeatedly rehearsed the dialogue, told Krissna that the word \"thadava\" sounded more effective than \"vaatti\", and suggested Krissna use \"thadava\" instead of \"vaatti\".{{efn|\"vaatti\" is a synonym of \"thadava\".{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|page=148}}}} Balakumaran initially did not agree with Rajinikanth and Krissna as he felt that the word \"vaatti\" was \"fine\" and that there was no need to change the dialogue.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|page=148}} Rajinikanth then spoke both the versions of the dialogue and convinced Balakumaran to change the word \"vaatti\" to \"thadava\".{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|page=149}} The dialogue had such an impact on everyone present at the set that, in the break that followed, everyone started using it one way or another. The dialogues occur only five times in the film.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|page=149}} According to ''[[The Times of India]]''{{'}}s Sunanya Suresh, it was potentially inspired by a line in [[Jane Austen]]'s novel ''[[Emma (novel)|Emma]]'', which read, \"If I've told you once, I've told you a 100 times.\"<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Rajinis-punch-dialogue-inspired-by-Jane-Austen-novel/articleshow/20312093.cms |title=Rajini's punch dialogue inspired by Jane Austen novel? |last=Suresh |first=Sunayana |date=29 May 2013 |work=[[The Times of India]] |access-date=25 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911055411/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Rajinis-punch-dialogue-inspired-by-Jane-Austen-novel/articleshow/20312093.cms |archive-date=11 September 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The scene where Rajinikanth's character, Manikkam, gets beaten up to protect his sibling and the following sequence where he beats up the antagonist in turn, was suggested to Krissna by Raju, the choreographer for both the stunt sequences.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|page=150}}\n\nRamalingam, the son of R. M. Veerappan, informed Krissna that Veerappan wanted to meet him. Krissna had finished shooting the sequence where Manikkam gets beaten up after trying to protect his younger brother. When Veerappan enquired Krissna about how the film was shaping up, Krissna spoke about the scene which he had shot before his meeting with Veerappan. Veerappan wanted the scene to be deleted from the film as he felt that people would not want to see an actor like Rajinikanth getting beaten up.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|page=150}} Rajinikanth offered to show a sneak preview of the film to Veerappan on 15 December 1994, and if Veerappan did not want the scene to be in the film, the scene would be re-shot, and Rajinikanth offered to bear the costs for re-shooting the scene himself.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|page=151}} The shooting was stalled for five days after Krissna's meeting with Veerappan. Later, Krissna, Raju, the choreographer for the stunt sequence, and cameraman Prakash concluded that the scene would be tweaked in such a way that it would be as if [[Mother Nature]] is angry at the treatment being meted out to a peace-loving person like Manikkam; it was also planned that backlighting and a poignant [[background music]] would be used as well.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|page=152}}\n\nTwenty-five scenes, including those which show Rajinikanth's house and neighborhood were shot at Vijaya Vauhini Studios.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|page=144}} The set at the studio was designed by Magie, the film's art director.

However, in March 2010, as [[SC Heerenveen]] had all three first-team goalkeepers on the injured list, he went on trial with the club and signed a contract until the end of [[2009\u201310 Eredivisie|the season]], contributing with nine games to an eventual 11th place-finish, and retiring for good in June.

retired [[Association football|footballer]] who played as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]].\n\n==Club career==\nTimmer was born in [[Hierden]], [[Harderwijk]], [[Gelderland]]. He spent his first 11 senior seasons in the [[Eerste Divisie|second division]], with [[FC Zwolle]] \u2013 named PEC in his first year. In 2000, he moved to [[AZ Alkmaar]], making his [[Eredivisie]] debut at almost 29 and also serving unassuming loans at [[Feyenoord]] and [[AFC Ajax]]. He was part of the Feyenoord squad that won the [[UEFA Cup 2001-02|2001\u201302 UEFA Cup]], and was an unused substitute in the [[2002 UEFA Cup Final|final]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/european/3027393/UEFA-Cup-results-and-team-details.html|title=UEFA Cup results and team details |publisher=Telegraph |date=8 May 2002 |accessdate=8 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003 Timmer returned to AZ for three more solid seasons, being essential as the club finished runner-up in the [[2005\u201306 Eredivisie|2006 league]] and [[2006\u201307 KNVB Cup|the following year]]'s [[KNVB Cup|domestic cup]]. He made another return in the 2006 summer, now to Feyenoord, leaving [[Alkmaar]] after an alleged fall-out with manager [[Louis van Gaal]].<ref>[http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/news/newsid=436623.html Timmer makes Feyenoord return]; UEFA.com, 13 July 2006</ref>\n\nTimmer retired from the game at almost 38, after helping Feyenoord to the seventh place in [[2008\u201309 Eredivisie|2008\u201309 campaign]], having appeared in 513 matches as a professional \u2013 only in the league. However, in March 2010, as [[SC Heerenveen]] had all three first-team goalkeepers on the injured list, he went on trial with the club and signed a contract until the end of [[2009\u201310 Eredivisie|the season]], contributing with nine games to an eventual 11th place-finish, and retiring for good in June. Timmer did not score a single goal in his entire career. In comparison, other dutch goalies of similar caliber did manage to score for their clubs, e.g. Raimond van der Gouw and Oscar Zijlstra.\n\nIn June 2012, Timmer was appointed as technical/commercial manager of second level club [[AGOVV Apeldoorn]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vi.nl/nieuws/222091/AGOVV-benoemt-oudinternational-Timmer-als-manager.htm|title=AGOVV benoemt oud-international Timmer als manager|trans-title=AGOVV appoints former international Timmer as manager|publisher=[[Voetbal International]]|language=Dutch|date=5 June 2012|accessdate=12 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n==International career==\nSomewhat of a [[late bloomer]] in the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch national side]], Timmer did not get his first call-up until February 2005, being summoned by [[Marco van Basten]] for an [[exhibition game]] with [[England national football team|England]] in [[Birmingham]].<ref>[http://www.uefa.com/worldcup/news/newsid=277485.html Van Basten opts for fresh faces]; UEFA.com, 4 February 2005</ref> His debut would only arrive on 12 November, in another friendly (1\u20133 home loss to [[Italy national football team|Italy]]).\n\nTimmer won seven caps for his country but never in official games, representing the nation at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 2008]].\n\n==Personal life==\nTimmer is married to [[Speed skating|speed skater]] [[Marianne Timmer]]. However they now lead separate lives. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/5619/Feyenoord/article/detail/3095089/2011/12/27/Timmer-en-Timmer-gaan-trouwen.dhtml|title=Timmer en Timmer gaan trouwen|trans-title=Timmer and Timmer to marry|newspaper=[[Algemeen Dagblad]]|language=Dutch|date=27 December 2011|accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nu.nl/achterklap/2926047/marianne-timmer-en-henk-timmer-getrouwd.html|title=Marianne Timmer en Henk Timmer getrouwd|trans-title=Marianne Timmer and Henk Timmer married|publisher=[[NU.nl]]|language=Dutch|date=4 October 2012|accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref> After retiring in 2009, he said Heerenveen would be the only club he would play for if he decided to return, as she had previously experienced success in Heerenveen's [[Thialf]].\n\n==Club statistics==\n<ref>{{cite news|url=https://int.soccerway.com/players/henk-timmer/6/|title=H.

Like most it is formed of one eight-car 200m set that can be coupled with another to produce a 16-car 400m set. Like other Velaros they can operate at temperatures between -25&nbsp;\u00b0C and 40&nbsp;\u00b0C. Most new technical features will also be used in all future Velaro trains.\n\n=== Visual ===\n[[File:TCDD HT80000 Siemens Velaro.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Driving car of a TCDD HT80000 EMU]]\nA ''white - turquoise - grey'' colour scheme has been selected for the livery of the TCDD HT80000 high-speed train sets, instead of the traditional ''white - red - dark blue'' colour scheme used on the [[TCDD HT65000]] high-speed train sets. \n\nThe appearance of the TCDD HT80000 is closer to that of the '2nd generation' [[Siemens Velaro|Velaro]] trains (e.g. [[British Rail Class 374|Eurostar E320]]) as opposed to the look of older [[Siemens Velaro|Velaros]] like the [[ICE 3M]], that have the lights closer to the coupler, as opposed to the newer position against the windscreen surrounds, although if you look more closely this is the fourth stage of evolution which can be seen on the outside with the new Velaro. The door windows are larger, square windows, as opposed to the airplane style oval windows on older [[Siemens Velaro|Velaro]] models. All electrical equipment is covered, that also enhances aerodynamics.\n\n=== Technical ===\nEach eight-car, 200m set has 32 [[axle]]s, of which 16 are driven. This gives the following wheel arrangement:\n\nBo\u2019Bo\u2019+2\u20192\u2019+Bo\u2019Bo\u2019+2\u20192\u2019+2\u20192\u2019+Bo\u2019Bo\u2019+2\u20192\u2019+Bo\u2019Bo'\n\nAll trains are fitted with [[European Train Control System|ETCS]].<ref name=pdf/> Siemens gained data on aerodynamics from Germany, China, Spain and Russia. A high roof from the middle portion of the end car was introduced as it reduces sonic boom in tunnels, improves the driving friction and reduces exterior noise. Further aerodynamic improvements to the nose and spoiler means reduced CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of 14 g/passenger-km. In comparison, the average CO<sub>2</sub> emission of an aircraft with the same payload is 136 g/passenger-km.<ref name=pdf/>\n\nAs the first set was originally destined for DB, it differs from the rest of the series at some points.

Like most it is formed of one eight-car 200m set that can be coupled with another to produce a 16-car 400m set. Like other Velaros they can operate at temperatures between -25&nbsp;\u00b0C and 40&nbsp;\u00b0C. Most new technical features will also be used in all future Velaro trains.\n\n=== Visual ===\n[[File:TCDD HT80000 Siemens Velaro.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Driving car of a TCDD HT80000 EMU]]\nA ''white - turquoise - grey'' colour scheme has been selected for the livery of the TCDD HT80000 high-speed train sets, instead of the traditional ''white - red - dark blue'' colour scheme used on the [[TCDD HT65000]] high-speed train sets. \n\nThe appearance of the TCDD HT80000 is closer to that of the '2nd generation' [[Siemens Velaro|Velaro]] trains (e.g. [[British Rail Class 374|Eurostar E320]]) as opposed to the look of older [[Siemens Velaro|Velaros]] like the [[ICE 3M]], that have the lights closer to the coupler, as opposed to the newer position against the windscreen surrounds, although if you look more closely this is the fourth stage of evolution which can be seen on the outside with the new Velaro. The door windows are larger, square windows, as opposed to the airplane style oval windows on older [[Siemens Velaro|Velaro]] models. All electrical equipment is covered, that also enhances aerodynamics.\n\n=== Technical ===\nEach eight-car, 200m set has 32 [[axle]]s, of which 16 are driven. This gives the following wheel arrangement:\n\nBo\u2019Bo\u2019+2\u20192\u2019+Bo\u2019Bo\u2019+2\u20192\u2019+2\u20192\u2019+Bo\u2019Bo\u2019+2\u20192\u2019+Bo\u2019Bo'\n\nAll trains are fitted with [[European Train Control System|ETCS]].<ref name=pdf/> Siemens gained data on aerodynamics from Germany, China, Spain and Russia. A high roof from the middle portion of the end car was introduced as it reduces sonic boom in tunnels, improves the driving friction and reduces exterior noise. Further aerodynamic improvements to the nose and spoiler means reduced CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of 14 g/passenger-km. In comparison, the average CO<sub>2</sub> emission of an aircraft with the same payload is 136 g/passenger-km.<ref name=pdf/>\n\nAs the first set was originally destined for DB, it differs from the rest of the series at some points. First, this set can reach a maximum speed of 320&nbsp;km/h contrary to 300&nbsp;km/h for the following sets. The electric system will also be different. While Velaro D can run under four different voltage systems (15 kV, 16,7&nbsp;Hz AC / 25 kV, 50&nbsp;Hz AC & 1.5 kV DC/ 3 kV DC), Velaro TR is a pure [[25 kV AC railway electrification|25 kV, 50 Hz AC]] system vehicle.

It has educated members of both houses of the UK Parliament and has a strong legal tradition, I GO TO THIS SCHOOL having educated two present Lord Justices of Appeal (Sirs [[Rabinder Singh (judge)|Rabinder Singh]] and [[Timothy Holroyde]]).\n\nThe school is divided into three sections: the Infants and Juniors (ages 4\u201311), the Senior School (ages 11\u201316) and Sixth Form (ages 16\u201318).

The school motto ''Ex Spinis Uvas'', which translates as \"Grapes From Thorns\", is a play upon the names of the school founders Robert and Nicholas Thorne.\n\nThe Grammar Scole at Frome Gate was in the care of its first schoolmaster, Thomas Moffat, when good fortune stepped in to secure its future. The Thorne family were wealthy Bristol merchants, friends of men like [[John Cabot]] and known to royalty. They wished to endow a school where the sons of Bristol merchants and tradesmen could receive an education. On 17 March 1532, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] issued a [[Charter]] under which the Thornes could endow the Grammar School and establish it in larger premises at [[St Bartholomew's Hospital, Bristol|St Bartholomew's Hospital]] near the bottom of [[Christmas Steps (road)|Christmas Steps]]. There the boys learnt [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Divinity]] and some [[Hebrew]].\n\nBy 1767, the buildings were cramped. Charles Lee, the Master, persuaded the Corporation that the Grammar School should be allowed to exchange premises with the other City School, [[Queen Elizabeth's Hospital]], which had a pleasant, new site on Unity Street, further up the hill. This exchange was carried out, and Charles Lee proceeded to enjoy his new school by greatly reducing the numbers of boys. The School was set to rights in 1812, but education was moving away from the classics and this caused further problems resulting in the school being closed in 1844. It received a new scheme in 1847 and re-opened in January 1848 with 300 pupils.<ref>{{cite book | title = Bristol: Past and Present | page = 258 | year = 1882 | url = https://archive.org/stream/bristolpastandp01taylgoog#page/n278/mode/1up/search/grammar+school | author1 = James Fawckner Nicholls|author2=John Taylor | author-link1=James Fawckner Nicholls|volume = III \u2013 Civil and Modern History}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bristol Grammar School, Tyndall's Park.jpg|thumb|Bristol Grammar School at Tyndall's Park in 1882]]\nBy 1870 the headmaster (Rev John William Caldicott) told the Endowed Schools Commission that the school was \"full to overflowing\" with 240 boys. However, it was significantly less well endowed than Bristol's other secondary schools ([[Queen Elizabeth's Hospital|Queen Elizabeth's]], [[The Red Maids' School|Red Maids']] and [[Colston's School|Colston's]]), and its now dilapidated buildings were located in the wrong area of the city for pupils who mostly lived in [[Clifton, Bristol|Clifton]] and [[Redland, Bristol|Redland]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6pYOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA44 |title=Secondary Education in England, 1870-1902 |author=John Roach |page=145}}</ref> At that time, Bristol had substantial hospital endowments (second only to London and Edinburgh) but these were mostly spent on charity rather than education. The assistant charity commissioner proposed a scheme that would reorganise the objectives of the endowed schools and secure funding for the Grammar School and the new [[Clifton High School (Bristol)|Clifton High School for Girls]]. After several years of debate and negotiation the initiative was approved in 1875,<ref>{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6pYOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA47 | title = Secondary Education in England, 1870-1902 | author = John Roach | pages = 143\u2013150}}</ref> and in 1877 a new location in [[Tyndalls Park]] was agreed.\n\nThe first buildings in Tyndalls Park were occupied in 1879: the Big School, with its Great Hall, and the Headmaster's House, a modest dwelling which is now the Junior School. Further classrooms were added, a [[Gym]]nasium and a [[Fives|Fives Court]] and a Rifle Range. These have been rebuilt as art rooms and rehearsal rooms, but the Winterstoke wing still houses the laboratories which were added in 1914. The Preparatory School began in 1900, and in 1928 moved into its own building on Elton Road, but this was destroyed on the night of 24 November 1940 by incendiary bombs.\n\nThe Prep Hall, which survived, is now the Mackay Theatre. The Elton Road ruin was rebuilt as classrooms under John Garrett, who added the University Road block and began to colonise the other side of Elton Road. Since then, the school has built yet more classroom accommodation and a new sports hall; Modern Languages, Classics, Geography, Art and Music have their own Elton Road Houses, and the former playing field is now the Design and Technology Centre.\n\nThe school became a [[direct grant grammar school]] in 1946<ref>{{cite hansard | url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1946/may/31/grammar-schools-direct-grant-status | house=House of Commons |title=Grammar Schools (Direct Grant Status)| date=31 May 1946 | column_start=234W | column_end=234W }}</ref> as a result of the [[Education Act 1944]] and chose to become independent when direct grants were abolished by the [[Labour Government 1974\u20131979|1974\u20139 Labour Government]].<ref>{{cite hansard | url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1978/mar/22/direct-grant-schools | house=House of Commons |title=Direct Grant Schools| date=22 March 1978 | column_start=545 | column_end=545 }}</ref>\n\n===Houses===\nThere are six Houses in the Senior School, each named after its Head of House. Each student is placed in one of the six House groups at the beginning of their time in the Senior School, remaining in the House until they leave school. House activities include plays, music competitions and inter-House sporting tournaments.\n\nThe House names and colours are:\n*Scott's (black)\n*Niamir's (yellow)\n*Edwards's (blue)\n*Glenn's (red)\n*Short's (brown)\n*Hilliard's (green)\n\nThe school's boarding house was closed in July 1939.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hill |first1=C.P. |title=The History of Bristol Grammar School |date=1951 |publisher=Pitman |location=London}}</ref>\n\n====Colours====\nHouse colours are awarded, given at the end of the term should that person perform well in an activity or sport.\n\nSchool colours are awarded to pupils typically in their final year, who perform exceptionally well in sport or any other school activity. They would be expected to compete in a school team (such as Cricket, Rugby, Hockey or Football) and show continued commitment. This was extended to include performing arts, awarding several students colours for their contribution to [[concert]]s, [[Play (theatre)|play]]s and taking House assemblies.\n\n==Tutors and teaching==\nThe size of teaching groups ranges from 25 students per teacher in lower years to occasionally one per teacher (for less popular subjects in the sixth form). Optional subjects include Russian and [[Economics]]. All students have access to [[computer]]s with [[internet access]].\n\nThe school offers [[Ancient Greek]] as a subject from Year 9 onwards, and [[Classical Civilisation]] is also available now as a GCSE.\n\n===Sport===\nDuring the autumn term, the sport curriculum is dominated by [[rugby football|rugby]] for the boys and [[hockey]] for the girls. During the spring term, it is dominated by hockey, football and rugby for the boys and [[netball]] for the girls.\n\nDuring the summer term, there is a division between [[cricket]] for the boys and for the girls. Both sexes may participate in sports such as [[tennis]] and [[sport of athletics|athletics]].\n\nThe school owns a large area of land in [[Failand]] which features two AstroTurf hockey pitches, tarmac tennis/netball courts, five cricket pitches, nine rugby pitches, two football pitches and a 3G astro pitch. There is an athletics track as well as shot and javelin areas. Full-time grounds staff are employed. Sport is compulsory one afternoon a week for every year-group up to, and including, year 11. A new pavilion has been built as part of the 475th anniversary expansion of the school, replacing the old pavilion. There is now a larger car park and better coach access. The new pavilion provides facilities for up to 350 pupils and staff at a time with improved showering and changing facilities as well as an attractive hospitality area for spectators. The total cost of the project was \u00a32.4 million.\n\nThis is in addition to the sports hall on the Tyndall's Park campus, which supplements the one afternoon a week pupils spend doing sport with around another hour or so a week of PE within the school day.\n\nThe school rugby team won the U15 1991 [[Daily Mail Cup]] and came runner-up in the same competition in 1995.<ref>{{cite web|title=National Schools Cup : Past Winners|url=http://www.englandrugby.com/mm/Document/General/General/01/30/52/30/PastWinners14_Neutral.pdf|publisher=England Rugby|accessdate=11 October 2015}}</ref> Bristol Grammar has a sporting rivalry with fellow Bristol public school [[Clifton College]].\n\n===Model United Nations===\nBristol Grammar has been successful at [[Model United Nations]] for a number of years now, holding their own conference BGSMUN, in February, since 2007. These conferences, presided over by the school's own Secretaries General, include chairing teams of BGS Sixth Form students. Various schools are invited to compete, with [[Exeter College, Exeter|Exeter College]] winning the 2015 conference.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.exeterschool.org.uk/news-and-events/news-archive/spring-2013/mun-conference-at-bgs-demands-fast-responses|title=MUN conference at BGS demands fast responses|accessdate=13 January 2014}}</ref>\nThe school's own team has been particularly successful in recent years, winning Best Delegation at both Exeter College MUN and [[Cheadle Hulme School#Model United Nations|MUNCH]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mun-ch.co.uk/|title=MUNCH - Model United Nations at Cheadle Hulme|accessdate=7 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Campus==\n[[File:070522 ukbris bgs.jpg|thumb|Main entrance]]\nBristol Grammar School occupies a [[triangle]] of land between the [[University of Bristol]] on the University Road side, what used to be [[House of Fraser|Dingle's department store]] on the lower side and a series of houses on the Elton Road side known as Tyndalls Park. The school has been expanding, and while it has always owned all the houses to one side of the main campus until recently only four (Barton's, Norwood's, Martin's and Garrett's) were occupied. Most of the houses have now had their leases relinquished and have been converted into teaching space.\n\n===Great Hall===\nThe foundation stone was laid on 10 June 1877 and the school moved in during 1879. It is the largest first floor hall in the [[United Kingdom]]. In 1996, the old servery was removed and the hall was restored to its old layout; the roof was also renewed during this time. There is a full kitchen between the Great Hall and the Science Wing, as well as two classrooms and an office belonging to the history department. Underneath the Great Hall is the Staff Room, the Pople Room, and the school offices. It has been designated by [[English Heritage]] as a grade II [[listed building]].<ref>{{National Heritage List for England |num=1218741 |desc=Bristol Grammar School|grade=II |accessdate=23 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Bristol Grammar School  | work=historicengland.org.uk | url=https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1218741 | accessdate=2007-03-13}}</ref>\n\nTo one side of the Great Hall, sitting separate from the Hall itself and the Junior School, is another building designed to blend in. During the 1940s/1950s, this was the woodworking department, and later a staff work room. It is now a Music room which is also used for House Assemblies.\n\nThe Great Hall foundation stone has never been found. Inside the foundation stone there is a time capsule, reported to contain \"Copies of The Times and of the Bristol newspapers and a parchment document containing an account of the ceremony\". However, despite extensive searches of the outer walls, it has not been found. Two possibilities exist - that the foundation stone was placed at the far end of the building where the Science wing now is, and was destroyed or covered up when that building was erected; or that the stone is buried under tarmac towards the front of the building. The foundation stone was laid on 10 June 1877.\n\n[[File:Bristol Grammar School, Great Hall.jpg|thumb|Great Hall]]\nThe Big School was designed in the late [[Perpendicular Gothic]] style, by the Bristol firm of Foster and Wood. Sometimes known as the Long Room, but now usually as the Great Hall, it was designed as a teaching room, and the Masters\u2019 stalls are still in place.\n\nThe room is {{convert|140|ft|m}} long, {{convert|50|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|50|ft|m}} high. Downstairs there are now, as in 1879, the Headmaster's Study, the Senior Common Room, offices and classrooms. Originally these would have accommodated the Sixth Form, while the rest of the school had lessons together in the Hall.\n\nThe organ, which was built by Vowles & Son of St James\u2019 Square, was presented by [[William Wills, 1st Baron Winterstoke]], in January 1880. It cost over \u00a31,000 and it is still played for assemblies and concerts. Nowadays, the organ would cost at least \u00a32&nbsp;million.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070206094626/http://www.bristolgrammarschool.co.uk/main.php?page_id=483&cat_id=4 A brief history of BGS], Bristol Grammar School website</ref>\n\nThe main stairs leading out of the Great Hall have been modified to fulfil fire and safety regulations and in preparation for the new library and Sixth Form building known as [[Bristol Grammar School#The Hub|The Hub]]. When the whole school assembled in the Great Hall for the official opening of the new staircase, the invited guests included people who donated large sums of money to help get the project on its way and some of the OBs, including John Pople, who have supported the school. This work was permitted due to work done by the school's archivist who demonstrated that this was the way that the original staircase was likely to have been. This satisfied the authorities sufficiently that they granted permission to make structural alterations to the Grade II listed building. The Hub project however, was cancelled by the new Headmaster, Roderick MacKinnon, so the planned building, which was popular among students,  was discarded. This was mainly due to financing issues as building the hub would be very expensive (at least \u00a31 million).\n\nThe staircase was originally one big staircase which started at ground level, led up and split into two smaller ones which doubled back to reach the Great Hall. This has now been reversed; two smaller staircases lead up and merge into a larger one which doubles back to reach the Great Hall. This meant that the wall between the two smaller staircases could be knocked through to insert a modern automated double glass door allowing pupils to reach the Great Hall with greater ease from within the campus. The old entrance with the great wooden doors at the front still remains. Previously a small door to the campus side of the building was for visitors, teachers and Prefects only.\n\nThe School has re-purposed the Elton Road block, and changed the Mackay Theatre into a mixed use space for the music school. Most of the teaching rooms in this block are now used for this purpose. The block has been extended with a new 245 seat (standard layout) theatre, and additional rehearsal/teaching space, and is named the 1532 Performing Arts Centre. This centre fits between the Elton Road Block and the Princess Anne Block. This is one of the biggest building jobs on the main campus since 1994 when the Design & Technology Centre was built in the centre of the site..\n\n==School song==\n'''''Carmen Bristoliense''''' (Song of the Bristolians) is the school song of Bristol Grammar School, which is sung in [[Latin]]. The song was written in 1909 by Headmaster [[Cyril Norwood]], and set to music by the Director of Music, C. W. Stear. It is sung in the final [[school assembly]] each term, and at other school or related events such as the annual prize giving ceremony and old boys' (and girls') dinners.  The song consists of four verses and a chorus, although usually only the first verse and chorus are sung. The fifth line was updated from Norwood's original on the 400th anniversary of the school's founding.\n\n==Headmasters==\n{{main|List of headmasters at Bristol Grammar School}}\nUntil the 19th century, the Headmaster was known simply as the \"Master\" and his assistants as \"Ushers\". Little is known of those of the 16th century and nothing of any before Thomas Moffat, the \"scolemaster\" of the City Audit Book of 1532 who took the School to the Bartholomews. The first few dates are conjectural.\n\n==Old Bristolians==\n{{Main|:Category:People educated at Bristol Grammar School|List of Old Bristolians}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Robbins, K., 2010.

It has educated members of both houses of the UK Parliament and has a strong legal tradition, having educated two present Lord Justices of Appeal (Sirs [[Rabinder Singh (judge)|Rabinder Singh]] and [[Timothy Holroyde]]).\n\nThe school is divided into three sections: the Infants and Juniors (ages 4\u201311), the Senior School (ages 11\u201316) and Sixth Form (ages 16\u201318).

The school motto ''Ex Spinis Uvas'', which translates as \"Grapes From Thorns\", is a play upon the names of the school founders Robert and Nicholas Thorne.\n\nThe Grammar Scole at Frome Gate was in the care of its first schoolmaster, Thomas Moffat, when good fortune stepped in to secure its future. The Thorne family were wealthy Bristol merchants, friends of men like [[John Cabot]] and known to royalty. They wished to endow a school where the sons of Bristol merchants and tradesmen could receive an education. On 17 March 1532, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] issued a [[Charter]] under which the Thornes could endow the Grammar School and establish it in larger premises at [[St Bartholomew's Hospital, Bristol|St Bartholomew's Hospital]] near the bottom of [[Christmas Steps (road)|Christmas Steps]]. There the boys learnt [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Divinity]] and some [[Hebrew]].\n\nBy 1767, the buildings were cramped. Charles Lee, the Master, persuaded the Corporation that the Grammar School should be allowed to exchange premises with the other City School, [[Queen Elizabeth's Hospital]], which had a pleasant, new site on Unity Street, further up the hill. This exchange was carried out, and Charles Lee proceeded to enjoy his new school by greatly reducing the numbers of boys. The School was set to rights in 1812, but education was moving away from the classics and this caused further problems resulting in the school being closed in 1844. It received a new scheme in 1847 and re-opened in January 1848 with 300 pupils.<ref>{{cite book | title = Bristol: Past and Present | page = 258 | year = 1882 | url = https://archive.org/stream/bristolpastandp01taylgoog#page/n278/mode/1up/search/grammar+school | author1 = James Fawckner Nicholls|author2=John Taylor | author-link1=James Fawckner Nicholls|volume = III \u2013 Civil and Modern History}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bristol Grammar School, Tyndall's Park.jpg|thumb|Bristol Grammar School at Tyndall's Park in 1882]]\nBy 1870 the headmaster (Rev John William Caldicott) told the Endowed Schools Commission that the school was \"full to overflowing\" with 240 boys. However, it was significantly less well endowed than Bristol's other secondary schools ([[Queen Elizabeth's Hospital|Queen Elizabeth's]], [[The Red Maids' School|Red Maids']] and [[Colston's School|Colston's]]), and its now dilapidated buildings were located in the wrong area of the city for pupils who mostly lived in [[Clifton, Bristol|Clifton]] and [[Redland, Bristol|Redland]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6pYOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA44 |title=Secondary Education in England, 1870-1902 |author=John Roach |page=145}}</ref> At that time, Bristol had substantial hospital endowments (second only to London and Edinburgh) but these were mostly spent on charity rather than education.

After several years of debate and negotiation the initiative was approved in 1875,<ref>{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6pYOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA47 | title = Secondary Education in England, 1870-1902 | author = John Roach | pages = 143\u2013150}}</ref> and in 1877 a new location in [[Tyndalls Park]] was agreed.\n\nThe first buildings in Tyndalls Park were occupied in 1879: the Big School, with its Great Hall, and the Headmaster's House, a modest dwelling which is now the Junior School. Further classrooms were added, a [[Gym]]nasium and a [[Fives|Fives Court]] and a Rifle Range. These have been rebuilt as art rooms and rehearsal rooms, but the Winterstoke wing still houses the laboratories which were added in 1914. The Preparatory School began in 1900, and in 1928 moved into its own building on Elton Road, but this was destroyed on the night of 24 November 1940 by incendiary bombs.\n\nThe Prep Hall, which survived, is now the Mackay Theatre. The Elton Road ruin was rebuilt as classrooms under John Garrett, who added the University Road block and began to colonise the other side of Elton Road. Since then, the school has built yet more classroom accommodation and a new sports hall; Modern Languages, Classics, Geography, Art and Music have their own Elton Road Houses, and the former playing field is now the Design and Technology Centre.\n\nThe school became a [[direct grant grammar school]] in 1946<ref>{{cite hansard | url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1946/may/31/grammar-schools-direct-grant-status | house=House of Commons |title=Grammar Schools (Direct Grant Status)| date=31 May 1946 | column_start=234W | column_end=234W }}</ref> as a result of the [[Education Act 1944]] and chose to become independent when direct grants were abolished by the [[Labour Government 1974\u20131979|1974\u20139 Labour Government]].<ref>{{cite hansard | url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1978/mar/22/direct-grant-schools | house=House of Commons |title=Direct Grant Schools| date=22 March 1978 | column_start=545 | column_end=545 }}</ref>\n\n===Houses===\nThere are six Houses in the Senior School, each named after its Head of House. Each student is placed in one of the six House groups at the beginning of their time in the Senior School, remaining in the House until they leave school. House activities include plays, music competitions and inter-House sporting tournaments.\n\nThe House names and colours are:\n*Scott's (black)\n*Niamir's (yellow)\n*Edwards's (blue)\n*Glenn's (red)\n*Short's (brown)\n*Hilliard's (green)\n\nThe school's boarding house was closed in July 1939.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hill |first1=C.P. |title=The History of Bristol Grammar School |date=1951 |publisher=Pitman |location=London}}</ref>\n\n====Colours====\nHouse colours are awarded, given at the end of the term should that person perform well in an activity or sport.\n\nSchool colours are awarded to pupils typically in their final year, who perform exceptionally well in sport or any other school activity. They would be expected to compete in a school team (such as Cricket, Rugby, Hockey or Football) and show continued commitment. This was extended to include performing arts, awarding several students colours for their contribution to [[concert]]s, [[Play (theatre)|play]]s and taking House assemblies.\n\n==Tutors and teaching==\nThe size of teaching groups ranges from 25 students per teacher in lower years to occasionally one per teacher (for less popular subjects in the sixth form). Optional subjects include Russian and [[Economics]]. All students have access to [[computer]]s with [[internet access]].\n\nThe school offers [[Ancient Greek]] as a subject from Year 9 onwards, and [[Classical Civilisation]] is also available now as a GCSE.\n\n===Sport===\nDuring the autumn term, the sport curriculum is dominated by [[rugby football|rugby]] for the boys and [[hockey]] for the girls. During the spring term, it is dominated by hockey, football and rugby for the boys and [[netball]] for the girls.\n\nDuring the summer term, there is a division between [[cricket]] for the boys and for the girls. Both sexes may participate in sports such as [[tennis]] and [[sport of athletics|athletics]].\n\nThe school owns a large area of land in [[Failand]] which features two AstroTurf hockey pitches, tarmac tennis/netball courts, five cricket pitches, nine rugby pitches, two football pitches and a 3G astro pitch. There is an athletics track as well as shot and javelin areas. Full-time grounds staff are employed. Sport is compulsory one afternoon a week for every year-group up to, and including, year 11. A new pavilion has been built as part of the 475th anniversary expansion of the school, replacing the old pavilion. There is now a larger car park and better coach access. The new pavilion provides facilities for up to 350 pupils and staff at a time with improved showering and changing facilities as well as an attractive hospitality area for spectators. The total cost of the project was \u00a32.4 million.\n\nThis is in addition to the sports hall on the Tyndall's Park campus, which supplements the one afternoon a week pupils spend doing sport with around another hour or so a week of PE within the school day.\n\nThe school rugby team won the U15 1991 [[Daily Mail Cup]] and came runner-up in the same competition in 1995.<ref>{{cite web|title=National Schools Cup : Past Winners|url=http://www.englandrugby.com/mm/Document/General/General/01/30/52/30/PastWinners14_Neutral.pdf|publisher=England Rugby|accessdate=11 October 2015}}</ref> Bristol Grammar has a sporting rivalry with fellow Bristol public school [[Clifton College]].\n\n===Model United Nations===\nBristol Grammar has been successful at [[Model United Nations]] for a number of years now, holding their own conference BGSMUN, in February, since 2007. These conferences, presided over by the school's own Secretaries General, include chairing teams of BGS Sixth Form students. Various schools are invited to compete, with [[Exeter College, Exeter|Exeter College]] winning the 2015 conference.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.exeterschool.org.uk/news-and-events/news-archive/spring-2013/mun-conference-at-bgs-demands-fast-responses|title=MUN conference at BGS demands fast responses|accessdate=13 January 2014}}</ref>\nThe school's own team has been particularly successful in recent years, winning Best Delegation at both Exeter College MUN and [[Cheadle Hulme School#Model United Nations|MUNCH]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mun-ch.co.uk/|title=MUNCH - Model United Nations at Cheadle Hulme|accessdate=7 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Campus==\n[[File:070522 ukbris bgs.jpg|thumb|Main entrance]]\nBristol Grammar School occupies a [[triangle]] of land between the [[University of Bristol]] on the University Road side, what used to be [[House of Fraser|Dingle's department store]] on the lower side and a series of houses on the Elton Road side known as Tyndalls Park. The school has been expanding, and while it has always owned all the houses to one side of the main campus until recently only four (Barton's, Norwood's, Martin's and Garrett's) were occupied. Most of the houses have now had their leases relinquished and have been converted into teaching space.\n\n===Great Hall===\nThe foundation stone was laid on 10 June 1877 and the school moved in during 1879. It is the largest first floor hall in the [[United Kingdom]]. In 1996, the old servery was removed and the hall was restored to its old layout; the roof was also renewed during this time. There is a full kitchen between the Great Hall and the Science Wing, as well as two classrooms and an office belonging to the history department. Underneath the Great Hall is the Staff Room, the Pople Room, and the school offices. It has been designated by [[English Heritage]] as a grade II [[listed building]].<ref>{{National Heritage List for England |num=1218741 |desc=Bristol Grammar School|grade=II |accessdate=23 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Bristol Grammar School  | work=historicengland.org.uk | url=https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1218741 | accessdate=2007-03-13}}</ref>\n\nTo one side of the Great Hall, sitting separate from the Hall itself and the Junior School, is another building designed to blend in. During the 1940s/1950s, this was the woodworking department, and later a staff work room. It is now a Music room which is also used for House Assemblies.\n\nThe Great Hall foundation stone has never been found. Inside the foundation stone there is a time capsule, reported to contain \"Copies of The Times and of the Bristol newspapers and a parchment document containing an account of the ceremony\". However, despite extensive searches of the outer walls, it has not been found. Two possibilities exist - that the foundation stone was placed at the far end of the building where the Science wing now is, and was destroyed or covered up when that building was erected; or that the stone is buried under tarmac towards the front of the building. The foundation stone was laid on 10 June 1877.\n\n[[File:Bristol Grammar School, Great Hall.jpg|thumb|Great Hall]]\nThe Big School was designed in the late [[Perpendicular Gothic]] style, by the Bristol firm of Foster and Wood. Sometimes known as the Long Room, but now usually as the Great Hall, it was designed as a teaching room, and the Masters\u2019 stalls are still in place.\n\nThe room is {{convert|140|ft|m}} long, {{convert|50|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|50|ft|m}} high. Downstairs there are now, as in 1879, the Headmaster's Study, the Senior Common Room, offices and classrooms. Originally these would have accommodated the Sixth Form, while the rest of the school had lessons together in the Hall.\n\nThe organ, which was built by Vowles & Son of St James\u2019 Square, was presented by [[William Wills, 1st Baron Winterstoke]], in January 1880. It cost over \u00a31,000 and it is still played for assemblies and concerts. Nowadays, the organ would cost at least \u00a32&nbsp;million.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070206094626/http://www.bristolgrammarschool.co.uk/main.php?page_id=483&cat_id=4 A brief history of BGS], Bristol Grammar School website</ref>\n\nThe main stairs leading out of the Great Hall have been modified to fulfil fire and safety regulations and in preparation for the new library and Sixth Form building known as [[Bristol Grammar School#The Hub|The Hub]]. When the whole school assembled in the Great Hall for the official opening of the new staircase, the invited guests included people who donated large sums of money to help get the project on its way and some of the OBs, including John Pople, who have supported the school. This work was permitted due to work done by the school's archivist who demonstrated that this was the way that the original staircase was likely to have been. This satisfied the authorities sufficiently that they granted permission to make structural alterations to the Grade II listed building. The Hub project however, was cancelled by the new Headmaster, Roderick MacKinnon, so the planned building, which was popular among students,  was discarded. This was mainly due to financing issues as building the hub would be very expensive (at least \u00a31 million).\n\nThe staircase was originally one big staircase which started at ground level, led up and split into two smaller ones which doubled back to reach the Great Hall. This has now been reversed; two smaller staircases lead up and merge into a larger one which doubles back to reach the Great Hall. This meant that the wall between the two smaller staircases could be knocked through to insert a modern automated double glass door allowing pupils to reach the Great Hall with greater ease from within the campus. The old entrance with the great wooden doors at the front still remains. Previously a small door to the campus side of the building was for visitors, teachers and Prefects only.\n\nThe School has re-purposed the Elton Road block, and changed the Mackay Theatre into a mixed use space for the music school. Most of the teaching rooms in this block are now used for this purpose. The block has been extended with a new 245 seat (standard layout) theatre, and additional rehearsal/teaching space, and is named the 1532 Performing Arts Centre. This centre fits between the Elton Road Block and the Princess Anne Block. This is one of the biggest building jobs on the main campus since 1994 when the Design & Technology Centre was built in the centre of the site..\n\n==School song==\n'''''Carmen Bristoliense''''' (Song of the Bristolians) is the school song of Bristol Grammar School, which is sung in [[Latin]]. The song was written in 1909 by Headmaster [[Cyril Norwood]], and set to music by the Director of Music, C. W. Stear. It is sung in the final [[school assembly]] each term, and at other school or related events such as the annual prize giving ceremony and old boys' (and girls') dinners.  The song consists of four verses and a chorus, although usually only the first verse and chorus are sung. The fifth line was updated from Norwood's original on the 400th anniversary of the school's founding.\n\n==Headmasters==\n{{main|List of headmasters at Bristol Grammar School}}\nUntil the 19th century, the Headmaster was known simply as the \"Master\" and his assistants as \"Ushers\". Little is known of those of the 16th century and nothing of any before Thomas Moffat, the \"scolemaster\" of the City Audit Book of 1532 who took the School to the Bartholomews. The first few dates are conjectural.\n\n==Old Bristolians==\n{{Main|:Category:People educated at Bristol Grammar School|List of Old Bristolians}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Robbins, K., 2010.
