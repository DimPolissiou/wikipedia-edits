It was founded and incorporated in 1866 as a [[land grant college]] in [[Hanover, New Hampshire|Hanover]] in connection with [[Dartmouth College]], moved to Durham in 1893, and adopted its current name in 1923.\n\nThe university's Durham campus comprises six colleges. A seventh college, the [[University of New Hampshire at Manchester]], occupies the university's campus in [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]], the state's largest city. The [[University of New Hampshire School of Law]] is in [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]], the state's capital. The university is part of the [[University System of New Hampshire]].\n\n{{As of|2018}}, its combined campuses make UNH the largest state university system in the state of [[New Hampshire]], with over 15,000 students. It is also the most expensive state-sponsored school in the United States for in-state students.<ref>https://www.nhpr.org/post/state-tuition-nhs-public-universities-remains-highest-nation#stream/0</ref> The school is designated a [[Land-grant university|land-]], [[Sea grant colleges|sea-]], and [[Space grant college|space-grant]] institution. Its mascot is a [[wildcat]]; the university's colors are white and blue.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Thompson Hall, UNH Sunset.jpg|thumb|[[Thompson Hall (University of New Hampshire)|Thompson Hall]], built in 1892, is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].]] \n[[File:Morrill Hall, UNH.jpg|thumb|right|Morrill Hall c. 1920]]\n[[File:Durham NH 001.jpg|thumb|Pettee Hall c. 2005]]\nThe [[Morrill Act]] of 1862 granted federal lands to New Hampshire for the establishment of an agricultural-mechanical college. In 1866, the university was first incorporated as the [[New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts]] in [[Hanover, New Hampshire]], in association with [[Dartmouth College]]. The institution was officially associated with Dartmouth College and was directed by Dartmouth's president. Durham resident [[Benjamin Thompson (farmer)|Benjamin Thompson]] left his farm and assets to the state for the establishment of an agricultural college. On January 30, 1890, Benjamin Thompson died and his will became public. On March 5, 1891, [[Governor of New Hampshire|Governor]] [[Hiram A. Tuttle]] signed an act accepting the conditions of Thompson's will. On April 10, 1891, Governor Tuttle signed a [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] authorizing the college's move to [[Durham, New Hampshire]].\n\nIn 1892, the Board of Trustees hired [[Charles Eliot (landscape architect)|Charles Eliot]] to draw a site plan for the first five campus buildings: Thompson, Conant, Nesmith, and Hewitt Shops (now called Halls) and the Dairy Barn. Eliot visited Durham and worked for three months to create a plan prior to the move to Durham. The Class of 1892, excited about the pending move to Durham, held commencement exercises in an unfinished barn on the Durham campus. On April 18, 1892, the Board of Trustees voted to \"authorize the faculty to make all the arrangements for the packing and removal of college property at Hanover to Durham.\" The Class of 1893, followed the previous class and held commencement exercises in unfinished [[Thompson Hall (University of New Hampshire)|Thompson Hall]], the [[Romanesque Revival]] campus centerpiece designed by the prominent [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]] architectural firm of [[Edward Dow (architect)|Dow & Randlett]].\n\nIn fall 1893, classes officially began in Durham with 51 [[First year|freshmen]] and 13 upperclassmen, which was three times the projected enrollment. Graduate study was also established in fall 1893 for the first time. The number of students and the lack of state funds for dormitories caused a housing crunch and forced students to find housing in town. The lack of housing caused difficulty for attracting women to the university. In 1908, construction on Smith Hall, the first women's dorm, was completed using private and state funds. Prior to the construction of Fairchild Hall in 1915 for male students, 50 freshmen lived in the basement of DeMerritt Hall. With the continuing housing shortage for men, the administration encouraged the growth of the UNH [[Greek system]]. From the late 1910s through the 1930s, the fraternity system expanded and provided room and board for male students.\n\nIn 1923, Governor [[Fred H. Brown]] signed a bill changing the name of the college to '''University of New Hampshire'''. The university was incorporated on July 1, 1923.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/44359836/r_d_hetzel_now_university_prexy/ |title=R. D.

UNH is composed of eleven [[college]]s and graduate schools, offering 2,000 courses in over 100 majors. The eight colleges of UNH are:\n\n* College of [[Engineering]] and [[Physical science|Physical Sciences]] (CEPS)\n* College of [[Liberal Arts]] (COLA)\n* College of [[Life Sciences]] and [[Agriculture]] (COLSA)\n* Thompson School of [[Applied Science]] (TSAS)\n* College of [[Health]] and Human Services (CHHS)\n* [[University of New Hampshire at Manchester]] (UNHM)\n* UNH Graduate School\n* [[Whittemore School of Business and Economics|Peter T. Paul College of Business and Economics]] (PCBE), formerly the Whittemore School of Business and Economics (WSBE)\n* [[University of New Hampshire School of Law]]\n* Carsey School of Public Policy\n* School of Marine Science and Ocean Engineering\n\nThe university is a member of the [[New England Board of Higher Education]]'s New England Regional Student Program (NERSP) where New England public universities and colleges offer a number of undergraduate curricula with special considerations to students from other New England states. If an out-of-state student's home state school does not offer a certain degree program offered by UNH, that student can receive the in-state tuition rate, plus 75 percent if enrolled in the program.\n\nThe Thompson School of [[Applied Science]] (TSAS), first established in 1895 and now a division of COLSA, confers an [[associate degree]] in applied science in seven different programs: Applied Animal Science, Applied Business Management, Civil Technology, Community Leadership, Food Service Management, Forest Technology, and Horticultural Technology.\n\nThe coastal proximity of the university affords excellent programs in [[marine biology]] and [[oceanography]]. Facilities include the Jackson Estuarine Laboratory at Adams Point in Durham, and the [[Shoals Marine Laboratory]] jointly operated with [[Cornell University]] on [[Appledore Island]] in the [[Isles of Shoals]].\n\nThe [[University of New Hampshire Observatory]] is operated by the Department of Physics for educational purposes.\n\nThere are three main university-wide undergraduate research programs: Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP), Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF), and International Research Opportunities Program (IROP).\n\nThe university offers many opportunities for students to study abroad through managed programs, exchange programs and approved programs. As of fall 2004, there were 561 students (4 percent of the student body) studying in 38 different countries. The university runs/manages 22 study abroad programs in locations which include [[Cambridge]], England; [[London]], England; [[Edinburgh]], Scotland; [[Brest, France]]; [[Dijon]], France; [[Grenoble]], France; [[Budapest]], Hungary; [[Osaka]], Japan; [[Utrecht]], Netherlands; [[Maastricht]], Netherlands; [[Ascoli Piceno]], Italy; New Zealand; India; South Africa; Kenya; and [[Granada]], Spain. The university also accepts credit from over 300 approved programs that are run through other institutions.  The university organizes an annual summer abroad program at [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge|Gonville and Caius College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]].  There are also over 100 National Exchange Program opportunities.\n\nIn 2010, the [[Franklin Pierce Law Center]] in [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]] was incorporated into the University of New Hampshire System and renamed the [[University of New Hampshire School of Law]]. It is the only law school in the state of New Hampshire. The School of Law offers Juris Doctor degrees in addition to graduate studies in Intellectual Property and Commerce & Technology. The University of New Hampshire Law School is renowned for its intellectual property law programs, consistently ranking in the top ten of U.S. News & World Report rankings. In 2012, it was ranked 4th behind the University of California at Berkeley, Stanford University and George Washington University.\n\n{{anchor|WSBE}}\nThe [[Whittemore School of Business and Economics|Peter T.

The six member groups are Alliance, the Black Student Union, Hillel, Mosaico, the Native American Cultural Association, and the United Asian Coalition. Participation in the DSC is open to all UNH students. The DSC encourages student organizations with similar needs to be recognized under the Diversity Support Coalition by submitting a petition within the guidelines for the DSC constitution. The total membership of the DSC is 200 individuals.\n\nIn addition to the six organizations within the DSC, UNH students run over a dozen groups for the purpose of multiculturalism and peer reference groups. Groups include women in professional fields, country or geographic specific cultural clubs, and international student clubs.\n\n=== Women ===\nMultiple organizations on campus are focused on providing women in professional fields access to relational and ideational resources promoting success.

Luckily the UNH men's ski team was not cut, as they remain one of the top powerhouse teams in the nation. In 2013, the men's alpine team placed second  at the NCAA championships.

The campus core is considered to be the university property within a 10-minute walk from Thompson Hall, the symbolic and near-geographic center of campus. The campus core contains many of the academic and residential buildings, while the outer campus contains much of the agriculture land and buildings. The university owns a total of {{convert|2600|acre|km2}} of land.\n\n===Housing===\n[[File:Smith Hall, UNH.jpg|thumb|right|Smith Hall c. 1915]]\n[[File:Mills Hall.jpg|thumb|right|alt=alt text|Mills Hall - suites]]\n[[File:Durham NH 011.jpg|thumb|left|Babcock Hall]]\nThe university offers all underclassmen the opportunity to live in university housing. As of 2006, the university housed 55% of all undergraduate students. While not required to live on campus freshman year, students are strongly encouraged to; as of the fall 2009 semester over 99% of incoming freshmen chose to live on campus, and over 70% of returning sophomores did as well.\n\nThe university offers students a choice of traditional dorm rooms, suites, and on-campus apartments. The university's Campus Master Plan envisions housing about 60% of undergraduates, requiring an addition of 1700 beds. However, the state of New Hampshire does not provide funding for non-academically related buildings, including dormitories.\n\nUndergraduate housing is divided into three areas: The Hills, The Valley and The Timbers (formerly Area I, Area II and Area III, respectively). There are also two undergraduate apartment complexes, The Gables and Woodside Apartments. The university offers family housing in the Forest Park apartments and graduate housing in Babcock Hall. The second oldest dorm on campus is Hetzel Hall, named after the university's former president [[Ralph D. Hetzel]]. Built in 1925, it is located near downtown Durham.\n\nFor the fall 2006 semester, two new buildings at The Gables (\"North\" and \"South\") were opened, providing an additional 400 beds. In summer 2006, one-half of Forest Park was demolished to make way for two new buildings (A & B) of the Southeast Residential Community (SERC). Buildings SERC A and SERC B have provided housing for 492 students since fall 2007. Two existing mini-dorms were demolished during summer 2007 (leaving four more mini-dorms) to construct a third building, SERC C, which has provided housing for 235 students since fall 2008. SERC A, B, and C are now referred to as Handler, Peterson, and Haaland Hall. Plans exist to provide 781 new beds by demolishing the remaining 9 buildings (98 units) in Forest Park. Later plans call for the construction of a new 170-unit graduate housing facility at a location to be determined.\n\nDue to the over-enrollment of the 2006\u20132007 academic year, the university offered students who intended to live in campus housing a free parking pass for the academic year, credit in UNH \"Dining Dollars\" and a refund of the housing deposit given that the student withdrew their intentions to live on campus. The incentive was designed to free up space for the large incoming freshman class.\n\nStoke Hall is the largest residence building on campus. It houses a little over 700 undergraduate students.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.unh.edu/housing/facility/stoke-hall| title=Stoke Hall| publisher=University of New Hampshire Housing & Residential Life| accessdate=November 12, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, UNH installed life-saving [[automated external defibrillator]]s in two fraternity houses.<ref>{{Cite web| title = UNH installs AEDs in fraternity houses| url = http://www.wmur.com/news/unh-installs-aeds-in-fraternity-houses/36336182| publisher = [[WMUR]]| accessdate = November 10, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Themed housing===\nThe University of New Hampshire offers themed housing options for students interested in choosing a living environment that best suits their personality.

It was founded and incorporated in 1866 as a [[land grant college]] in [[Hanover, New Hampshire|Hanover]] in connection with [[Dartmouth College]], moved to Durham in 1893, and adopted its current name in 1923.\n\nThe university's Durham campus comprises six colleges. A seventh college, the [[University of New Hampshire at Manchester]], occupies the university's campus in [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]], the state's largest city. The [[University of New Hampshire School of Law]] is in [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]], the state's capital. The university is part of the [[University System of New Hampshire]].\n\n{{As of|2018}}, its combined campuses make UNH the largest state university system in the state of [[New Hampshire]], with over 15,000 students. It is also the most expensive state-sponsored school in the United States for in-state students.<ref>https://www.nhpr.org/post/state-tuition-nhs-public-universities-remains-highest-nation#stream/0</ref> The school is designated a [[Land-grant university|land-]], [[Sea grant colleges|sea-]], and [[Space grant college|space-grant]] institution. Its mascot is a [[wildcat]]; the university's colors are white and blue.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Thompson Hall, UNH Sunset.jpg|thumb|[[Thompson Hall (University of New Hampshire)|Thompson Hall]], built in 1892, is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].]] \n[[File:Morrill Hall, UNH.jpg|thumb|right|Morrill Hall c. 1920]]\n[[File:Durham NH 001.jpg|thumb|Pettee Hall c. 2005]]\nThe [[Morrill Act]] of 1862 granted federal lands to New Hampshire for the establishment of an agricultural-mechanical college. In 1866, the university was first incorporated as the [[New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts]] in [[Hanover, New Hampshire]], in association with [[Dartmouth College]]. The institution was officially associated with Dartmouth College and was directed by Dartmouth's president. Durham resident [[Benjamin Thompson (farmer)|Benjamin Thompson]] left his farm and assets to the state for the establishment of an agricultural college. On January 30, 1890, Benjamin Thompson died and his will became public. On March 5, 1891, [[Governor of New Hampshire|Governor]] [[Hiram A. Tuttle]] signed an act accepting the conditions of Thompson's will. On April 10, 1891, Governor Tuttle signed a [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] authorizing the college's move to [[Durham, New Hampshire]].\n\nIn 1892, the Board of Trustees hired [[Charles Eliot (landscape architect)|Charles Eliot]] to draw a site plan for the first five campus buildings: Thompson, Conant, Nesmith, and Hewitt Shops (now called Halls) and the Dairy Barn. Eliot visited Durham and worked for three months to create a plan prior to the move to Durham. The Class of 1892, excited about the pending move to Durham, held commencement exercises in an unfinished barn on the Durham campus. On April 18, 1892, the Board of Trustees voted to \"authorize the faculty to make all the arrangements for the packing and removal of college property at Hanover to Durham.\" The Class of 1893, followed the previous class and held commencement exercises in unfinished [[Thompson Hall (University of New Hampshire)|Thompson Hall]], the [[Romanesque Revival]] campus centerpiece designed by the prominent [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]] architectural firm of [[Edward Dow (architect)|Dow & Randlett]].\n\nIn fall 1893, classes officially began in Durham with 51 [[First year|freshmen]] and 13 upperclassmen, which was three times the projected enrollment. Graduate study was also established in fall 1893 for the first time. The number of students and the lack of state funds for dormitories caused a housing crunch and forced students to find housing in town. The lack of housing caused difficulty for attracting women to the university. In 1908, construction on Smith Hall, the first women's dorm, was completed using private and state funds. Prior to the construction of Fairchild Hall in 1915 for male students, 50 freshmen lived in the basement of DeMerritt Hall. With the continuing housing shortage for men, the administration encouraged the growth of the UNH [[Greek system]]. From the late 1910s through the 1930s, the fraternity system expanded and provided room and board for male students.\n\nIn 1923, Governor [[Fred H. Brown]] signed a bill changing the name of the college to '''University of New Hampshire'''. The university was incorporated on July 1, 1923.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/44359836/r_d_hetzel_now_university_prexy/ |title=R. D.

UNH is composed of eleven [[college]]s and graduate schools, offering 2,000 courses in over 100 majors. The eight colleges of UNH are:\n\n* College of [[Engineering]] and [[Physical science|Physical Sciences]] (CEPS)\n* College of [[Liberal Arts]] (COLA)\n* College of [[Life Sciences]] and [[Agriculture]] (COLSA)\n* Thompson School of [[Applied Science]] (TSAS)\n* College of [[Health]] and Human Services (CHHS)\n* [[University of New Hampshire at Manchester]] (UNHM)\n* UNH Graduate School\n* [[Whittemore School of Business and Economics|Peter T. Paul College of Business and Economics]] (PCBE), formerly the Whittemore School of Business and Economics (WSBE)\n* [[University of New Hampshire School of Law]]\n* Carsey School of Public Policy\n* School of Marine Science and Ocean Engineering\n\nThe university is a member of the [[New England Board of Higher Education]]'s New England Regional Student Program (NERSP) where New England public universities and colleges offer a number of undergraduate curricula with special considerations to students from other New England states. If an out-of-state student's home state school does not offer a certain degree program offered by UNH, that student can receive the in-state tuition rate, plus 75 percent if enrolled in the program.\n\nThe Thompson School of [[Applied Science]] (TSAS), first established in 1895 and now a division of COLSA, confers an [[associate degree]] in applied science in seven different programs: Applied Animal Science, Applied Business Management, Civil Technology, Community Leadership, Food Service Management, Forest Technology, and Horticultural Technology.\n\nThe coastal proximity of the university affords excellent programs in [[marine biology]] and [[oceanography]]. Facilities include the Jackson Estuarine Laboratory at Adams Point in Durham, and the [[Shoals Marine Laboratory]] jointly operated with [[Cornell University]] on [[Appledore Island]] in the [[Isles of Shoals]].\n\nThe [[University of New Hampshire Observatory]] is operated by the Department of Physics for educational purposes.\n\nThere are three main university-wide undergraduate research programs: Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP), Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF), and International Research Opportunities Program (IROP).\n\nThe university offers many opportunities for students to study abroad through managed programs, exchange programs and approved programs. As of fall 2004, there were 561 students (4 percent of the student body) studying in 38 different countries. The university runs/manages 22 study abroad programs in locations which include [[Cambridge]], England; [[London]], England; [[Edinburgh]], Scotland; [[Brest, France]]; [[Dijon]], France; [[Grenoble]], France; [[Budapest]], Hungary; [[Osaka]], Japan; [[Utrecht]], Netherlands; [[Maastricht]], Netherlands; [[Ascoli Piceno]], Italy; New Zealand; India; South Africa; Kenya; and [[Granada]], Spain. The university also accepts credit from over 300 approved programs that are run through other institutions.  The university organizes an annual summer abroad program at [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge|Gonville and Caius College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]].  There are also over 100 National Exchange Program opportunities.\n\nIn 2010, the [[Franklin Pierce Law Center]] in [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]] was incorporated into the University of New Hampshire System and renamed the [[University of New Hampshire School of Law]]. It is the only law school in the state of New Hampshire. The School of Law offers Juris Doctor degrees in addition to graduate studies in Intellectual Property and Commerce & Technology. The University of New Hampshire Law School is renowned for its intellectual property law programs, consistently ranking in the top ten of U.S. News & World Report rankings. In 2012, it was ranked 4th behind the University of California at Berkeley, Stanford University and George Washington University.\n\n{{anchor|WSBE}}\nThe [[Whittemore School of Business and Economics|Peter T.

The six member groups are Alliance, the Black Student Union, Hillel, Mosaico, the Native American Cultural Association, and the United Asian Coalition. Participation in the DSC is open to all UNH students. The DSC encourages student organizations with similar needs to be recognized under the Diversity Support Coalition by submitting a petition within the guidelines for the DSC constitution. The total membership of the DSC is 200 individuals.\n\nIn addition to the six organizations within the DSC, UNH students run over a dozen groups for the purpose of multiculturalism and peer reference groups. Groups include women in professional fields, country or geographic specific cultural clubs, and international student clubs.\n\n=== Women ===\nMultiple organizations on campus are focused on providing women in professional fields access to relational and ideational resources promoting success. Women-focused groups on campus include Her Campus, UNH Data Driven Women, Women in Business, the Society of Woman Engineers, and Women in Science.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unh.edu/career/career-resources-women|title=Career Resources for Women|date=May 19, 2017|website=UNH Career and Professional Success|accessdate=May 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Cultural clubs ===\nCulturally focused groups on campus include the Desi Student Association, Japanese Cultural Club, Indonesian Student Association, International Student Organization, Middle Eastern Cultural Association, Russian Cultural Club and Vietnamese Student Association.

Luckily the UNH men's ski team was not cut, as they remain one of the top powerhouse teams in the nation. In 2013, the men's alpine team placed second  at the NCAA championships.

The campus core is considered to be the university property within a 10-minute walk from Thompson Hall, the symbolic and near-geographic center of campus.

As of 2006, the university housed 55% of all undergraduate students. While not required to live on campus freshman year, students are strongly encouraged to; as of the fall 2009 semester over 99% of incoming freshmen chose to live on campus, and over 70% of returning sophomores did as well.\n\nThe university offers students a choice of traditional dorm rooms, suites, and on-campus apartments. The university's Campus Master Plan envisions housing about 60% of undergraduates, requiring an addition of 1700 beds. However, the state of New Hampshire does not provide funding for non-academically related buildings, including dormitories.\n\nUndergraduate housing is divided into three areas: The Hills, The Valley and The Timbers (formerly Area I, Area II and Area III, respectively). There are also two undergraduate apartment complexes, The Gables and Woodside Apartments. The university offers family housing in the Forest Park apartments and graduate housing in Babcock Hall. The second oldest dorm on campus is Hetzel Hall, named after the university's former president [[Ralph D. Hetzel]]. Built in 1925, it is located near downtown Durham.\n\nFor the fall 2006 semester, two new buildings at The Gables (\"North\" and \"South\") were opened, providing an additional 400 beds. In summer 2006, one-half of Forest Park was demolished to make way for two new buildings (A & B) of the Southeast Residential Community (SERC). Buildings SERC A and SERC B have provided housing for 492 students since fall 2007. Two existing mini-dorms were demolished during summer 2007 (leaving four more mini-dorms) to construct a third building, SERC C, which has provided housing for 235 students since fall 2008. SERC A, B, and C are now referred to as Handler, Peterson, and Haaland Hall. Plans exist to provide 781 new beds by demolishing the remaining 9 buildings (98 units) in Forest Park. Later plans call for the construction of a new 170-unit graduate housing facility at a location to be determined.\n\nDue to the over-enrollment of the 2006\u20132007 academic year, the university offered students who intended to live in campus housing a free parking pass for the academic year, credit in UNH \"Dining Dollars\" and a refund of the housing deposit given that the student withdrew their intentions to live on campus. The incentive was designed to free up space for the large incoming freshman class.\n\nStoke Hall is the largest residence building on campus. It houses a little over 700 undergraduate students.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.unh.edu/housing/facility/stoke-hall| title=Stoke Hall| publisher=University of New Hampshire Housing & Residential Life| accessdate=November 12, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, UNH installed life-saving [[automated external defibrillator]]s in two fraternity houses.<ref>{{Cite web| title = UNH installs AEDs in fraternity houses| url = http://www.wmur.com/news/unh-installs-aeds-in-fraternity-houses/36336182| publisher = [[WMUR]]| accessdate = November 10, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Themed housing===\nThe University of New Hampshire offers themed housing options for students interested in choosing a living environment that best suits their personality.

The kingdom was founded by [[Taksin|King Taksin the Great]], who relocated the capital to [[Thonburi]]. The kingdom of Thonburi existed from 1767 to 1782. In 1782, [[King Rama I]] founded the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]] and relocated the capital to [[Bangkok]] on the other side of the [[Chao Phraya River]], thus bringing the Thonburi kingdom to an end. The city of Thonburi remained an independent town and province until it was merged into [[Bangkok]] in 1971.\n\n==Reestablishment of Siamese authority==\n[[Image:KingTaksin's coronation.jpg|thumb|left|Taksin's coronation at Thonburi (Bangkok) 28-December\u20131768]]\nIn 1767, after dominating southeast Asia for almost 400 years, the [[Ayutthaya kingdom]] was destroyed. The royal palace and the city were burnt to the ground. The territory was occupied by the [[Burma|Burmese]] army and local leaders declared themselves overlords including the lords of Sakwangburi, [[Pimai|Phimai]], [[Chanthaburi]], and [[Nakhon Si Thammarat]]. [[Taksin|Chao Tak]], a nobleman of Chinese descent and a capable military leader, proceeded to make himself a lord by [[right of conquest]],  beginning with the legendary sack of [[Chanthaburi]]. Based at Chanthaburi, Chao Tak raised troops and resources, and sent a fleet up the [[Chao Phraya]] to take the fort of [[Thonburi]]. In the same year, Chao Tak was able to retake Ayutthaya from the Burmese only seven months after the fall of the city.<ref>\u0e08\u0e23\u0e23\u0e22\u0e32 \u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e0a\u0e34\u0e15\u0e42\u0e23\u0e21\u0e23\u0e31\u0e19.

The Burmese armies arrived through [[Amphoe Sai Yok|Sai Yok]] and laid siege on the Bang Kung camp \u2013 the camp for Taksin's Chinese troops \u2013 in modern [[Samut Songkhram]] Province. Taksin hurriedly sent one of his generals [[Maha Sura Singhanat|Boonma]] to command the fleet to Bang Kung to relieve the siege. Siamese armies encircled the Burmese siege and defeated them.\n\nAyutthaya, the center of Siamese authority for hundreds of years, was so devastated that it could not be used as a government center. Tak founded the new city of [[Thonburi|Thonburi Sri Mahasamut]] on the west bank of Chao Phraya river. The construction took place for about a year and Tak crowned himself in late 1768 as King Sanphet but he was known to people as King Taksin \u2013 a combination of his title and personal name. Taksin crowned himself as a King of Ayutthaya to signify the continuation to ancient glories.<ref>David K. Wyatt. Thailand: A Short History. Yale University Press</ref>\n\n==Reunification and expansion==\nThere were still local [[warlord]]s competing for Siam. Taksin marched first in 1768 to [[Pitsanulok|Phitsanulok]] to subjugate the Lord of Phitsanulok who ruled over Upper Chao Phraya Basin. Taksin was injured during the campaign and had to retreat. The war readily weakened Phitsanulok and then it was in turn subjugated by the Lord of [[Sakwangburi]]. The same year Taksin sent [[Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke|Thong Duang]] and [[Maha Sura Singhanat|Boonma]] to tame the Prince Theppipit \u2013 the ruler of [[Phimai]] to the north of [[Nakhon Ratchasima]] on the [[Khorat Plateau]]. The prince was a son of [[Borommakot]] and was defeated by Thonburi armies. Theppipit fled to [[Vientiene|Vientiane]] but was captured and then executed.\n\nIn 1769, Taksin sent ''Phraya'' Chakri south to subjugate the Lord of Nakhon Si Thammarat. The lord fled to [[Pattani]] but was returned to Taksin, who reinstalled him back as the ruler of Nakhon Si Thammarat under Taksin's governance.\n\nPrince [[Ang Non]] the [[Uparaja]] of [[Cambodia]] fled to Thonburi in 1769 after his conflicts with King [[Narairaja]] for Siamese supports. Taksin then took this opportunity to request tributary from Cambodia, which Narairaja refused. Taksin sent [[Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke|''Phraya'' Abhay Ronnarit]] and [[Maha Sura Singhanat|''Phraya'' Anuchit Racha]] to subjugate Cambodia, taking [[Siemreap|Siem Reap]] and [[Battambang]]. But Taksin's absence from the capital (in wars with Nakhon Si Thammarat) shook the political stability and the two generals decided to retreat to Thonburi.\n\nBy this time, the only rival to Thonburi authority was the Sakwangburi lordship led by the powerful monk [[Chao Phra Faang]]. Chao Phra Faang\u2019s domain encompassed the northernmost territories bordering [[Lanna]] to [[Nakhon Sawan]] to the south as the result of annexation of Phitsanulok lordship in 1768. In 1770, Chao Phra Faang sent reinforcements southwards reaching [[Chainat|Chai Nat]]. Taksin perceived this action as threats and decided to invade Sakwangburi beforehand. The royal fleet marched upstream the Chao Phraya River and took Phitsanulok with ease. Taksin then divided the armies into the east one led by Boonma and the west one led by [[Phraya Pichai|''Phraya'' Pichai]] to be joined at Sakwangburi. Sakwangburi quickly fell after three days and Chao Phra Faang went lost.\n\nTaksin stayed at Phitsanulok to oversee the census and levy of northern population. He appointed Boonma to ''Chao Phraya'' Surasi as the governor of Phitsanulok and all northern cities and ''Phraya'' Abhay Ronnarit to ''Chao Phraya'' Chakri the chancellor.\n\nLater in 1771, Taksin decided to finish off the Cambodian campaign by assigning ''Chao Phraya'' Chakri command of land forces with Prince Ang Non and Taksin himself went by fleet. The Siamese took various Cambodian cities and drove Narairaja out of the throne. Ang Non was installed as Reamraja and Narairaja became the Uparaja with the Cambodian court paying tribute to Thonburi.\n\n==Wars with Burma==\n{{further|Burma\u2013Thailand relations|Burmese\u2013Siamese War (1765\u201367)#Geopolitical situation to the next war (1768\u20131776)}}\nTaksin had consolidated the old Siamese kingdom with new base at Thonburi. However, the Burmese were still ready to wage massive wars to bring the Siamese down again. From their base at [[Chiang Mai]], they invaded [[Sawankhalok District|Sawankhalok]] in 1770 but the Siamese were able to repel. This realized Taksin the importance of Lanna as the base of resources for the Burmese to attack northern territories. If Lanna was brought under Siamese control then the Burmese threats would by annihilated.\n\nAt the time Lanna, centered on Chiang Mai, was ruled by a Burmese general Paw Myunguaun.  He was the general who led the invasion of Sawankhalok in 1770 but was countered by ''Chao Phraya'' Surasi\u2019s armies from Phitsanulok. In the same year, the Siamese pioneered a little invasion of Chiang Mai and failed to gain any fruitful results.\n\nIn 1772, Paw Thupla, another Burmese general who had been in wars in [[Laos]], headed west and attack [[Phichai District|Phichai]] and [[Uttaradit]]. The armies of Phitsanulok once again repelled the Burmese invasions. They came again in 1773 and this time ''Phraya'' Phichai made his legendary sword break.\n\n===Wars over Lan na===\n{{see also|Burmese\u2013Siamese War (1775\u201376)}}\n[[File:Battle of Bangkeo.jpg|thumb|250px|Battle of Bangkeo in Ratchaburi]]\nIn 1774, Taksin ordered ''Chao Phraya'' Chakri and ''Chao Phraya'' Surasi to invade Chiang Mai. After nearly 200 years of Burmese rule, Lanna passed to the Siamese hands. The two ''Chao Phraya''s were able to take Chiang Mai with the help of local insurgents against Burma and Taksin appointed them the local rulers: Phraya Chabaan as Phraya Vichianprakarn the Lord of Chiangmai, Phraya [[Kawila]] as the Lord of Lampang, and Phraya Vaiwongsa as Lord of Lampoon. All the lordships paid tribute to Thonburi. Paw Myunguaun and the Burmese authority retreated to [[Lanna|Chiang Saen]].\n\nDuring Taksin\u2019s northern campaigns, the Burmese armies took the opportunity to invade Thonburi through Ta Din Daeng. The Burmese encamped at [[Bangkaew]] but were surrounded by the Siamese armies commanded by Taksin. For more than a month the Burmese had been locked in the siege and thousand of them died.<ref>http://www.bloggang.com/viewdiary.php?id=secret-world&month=03-2010&date=04&group=1&gblog=85</ref> Another thousand became captives to the Siamese.\n\nIn 1775 there came the hugest invasion of the Burmese led by [[Maha Thiha Thura]]. Instead of dividing the forces invading through various ways, Maha Thiha Thura amassed the troop of 30,000 as a whole directly towards Phitsanulok whose inhabitants were only 10,000 in number. Paw Thupla and Paw Myunguaun from Chiang Saen attempted to retake Chiang Mai but were halted by the two ''Chao Phraya''s, who after Chiang Mai hurried back to Phitsanulok to defend the city. The engagements occurred near Phitsanulok.\n\nMaha Thiha Thura directed the troops at Phitsanulok so immensely that the Siamese were about to fall. He cut down the supply lines and attacked the royal army. The two ''Chao Phraya''s decided to abandon Phitsanulok. The Burmese entered the city with victory but due to the death of Hsinbyushin the Burmese king the same year. They had to retreat.\n\nAfter the death of the Burmese king Hsinbyushin the Burmese were plunged in their own dynastic struggles. In 1776, the new monarch [[Singu Min|Singusa]] sent Maha Thiha Thura to invade Lanna again with such a huge army that Lord Vichianprakarn of Chiang Mai had to abandon the city. ''Chao Phraya'' Surasi and Lord Kawila of Lampang retook Chiang Mai from the Burmese but decided to left the city abandoned as there was no population to fill the city. No further Burmese invasions came as Singu staged his dynastic purges on the princes and Maha Thiha Thura himself.\n\n==Expansions ==\nIn 1776, a governor of Nangrong (modern [[Nakhon Nayok]]) had a row with the governor of [[Nakhon Ratchasima]] the head city of the region. The governor then sought supports from King [[Sayakumane]] of [[Kingdom of Champasak|Champasak]]. This became a ''casus bellum'' for Taksin to send ''Chao Phraya'' Chakri to conquer Champasak. King Sayakumane fled but was captured and detained in Thonburi for two years until he was sent to rule his kingdom again in 1780 paying tribute to Thonburi. The Champasak campaign earned Chakri the title ''Somdet Chao Phraya'' Maha Kasatseuk. Taksin invented the title ''Somdet Chao Phraya'' for a mandarin with equal honor as a royalty.\n\nIn 1778, a Laotian mandarin named Phra Wo sought Siamese supports against King Bunsan of [[Vientiene|Vientiane]] but was killed by the Laotian king. Taksin then dispatched the troops in 1779 led by the two famous brothers commanders, Phraya Chakri and his brother, Phraya Surasi to subjugate Vientiane. At the same time King Suriyavong of [[Luang Prabang]] submitted himself to Thonburi and joined the invasion of Vientiane. King Bunsan fled and hid in the forests but later gave up himself to the Siamese. The Vientiane royal family was deported to Thonburi as hostages. Thonburi forces took two valuable Buddha images, the symbolic icons of Vientiane \u2013 the [[Emerald Buddha]] and [[Phra Bang]] to Thonburi. Then all of the three Laotian kingdoms became Siamese tributaries and remained under Siamese rule for another hundred years.\n\n=== Territory ===\nThe kingdom under Taksin rule was much smaller than it was in Ayutthaya times. It included the following provinces : [[Thon Buri|Thonburi]], [[Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]], [[Ang Thong]], [[Singburi]], [[Lopburi]], [[Uthai Thani]], [[Nakhon Sawan]], [[Chachoengsao]], [[Prachinburi]], [[Nakhon Nayok]], [[Chonburi (city)|Chonburi]], [[Rayong]], [[Chantaburi|Chanthaburi]], [[Trat]], [[Amphoe Nakhon Chai Si|Nakhon Chai Si]], [[Nakhon Pathom]], [[Suphanburi]], [[Ratchaburi]], [[Samut Sakhon]], [[Samut Songkhram]], [[Phetchaburi]], [[Kanchanaburi]], and [[Prachuap Khiri Khan]].\n\nThroughout his reign, King Taksin carried out his policy of expansion.\n\nIn the north, including the whole of Lanna. Burmese was driven out. Local allies became Thonburi's subjugation.\n\nIn the south, including [[Syburi]] (present-day [[Kedah]]) and [[Trengganu]] in [[Malaysia]].\n\nIn the east, Cambodia was subjugated. His forces even attacked [[South Vietnam]]\n\nIn the northeast, including Vientiane, [[Phuan people|Phuan]], Luang Prabang, and Hua Phan Ha Thang Hok.\n\nIn the southeast, including Phutthaimat ([[H\u00e0 Ti\u00ean]] in [[Vietnam]] today).\n\nIn the west, as far as [[Mergui]] and [[Tenasserim Division|Tenasserim]] in [[Myanmar]] today leading to the [[Indian Ocean]].<ref name=\"KING TAKSIN DAY\">[http://webhost.m-culture.go.th/culture01/en/index.php/articles/30-the-important-days-in-thailand/50-king-taksin-day.html KING TAKSIN DAY] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20110428042550/http://webhost.m-culture.go.th/culture01/en/index.php/articles/30-the-important-days-in-thailand/50-king-taksin-day.html |date=28 April 2011 }} ''webhost.m-culture.go.th'' Retrieved 28 December 2007</ref><ref>W.A.R.Wood, pp. 251\u2013252</ref>\n\n==Military ==\n{{Main|History of the Thai armed forces before 1852}}\n{{Empty section|date=May 2018}}\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Wat Arun Ratchawararam Ratchawaramahawihan.jpg|thumb|280px|right|[[Wat Arun]], [[Thon Buri District|Thonburi]]]]\nYears of warfare and the Burmese invasions prevented any peasants to engage in agricultural activities. Majority of people had been deported to Burma in the fall of Ayutthaya in 1767 and the lack of manpower became the source of problems. Taksin had tried his best to encourage people to come out of forest hidings and promote farming. He promulgated the [[Conscription Tattooing]] in 1773 which left a permanent mark on commoners' bodies, preventing them from fleeing or moving. The practice continued well into Rattanakosin times until the abolition of levy itself by King [[Chulalongkorn]] later. As Taksin was from a Chinese merchant family, he sold his both royal and familial properties and belongings to subsidize the production by giving money off to people. This proved to be a temporary relief for such an economic decline. Nevertheless, the Siamese economy after the catastrophes needed time to rehabilitate.\n\nTaksin himself also commissioned trade missions to the neighbouring countries to bring Siam back to outside world, mainly with China. He dispatched several missions with tributes to the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] in 1781 to resume diplomatic and commercial relationships.\n\n==Political and economic troubles==\n[[File:Royal Thai Navy HQ, view form Phra Prang of Wat Arun.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Phra Racha Wang Derm]], the former royal palace of King Taksin, now used as the [[Royal Thai Navy]]'s HQ, view form Phra Prang of [[Wat Arun]], Thonburi, Bangkok.]]\nThonburi began forming its society. Taksin gathered resources by wars and deals with Chinese merchants. Major groups of people in Thonburi were local Thais, ''phrai'', or 'commoners', Chinese, Laotians, Khmers, Mons. Some powerful Chinese merchants trading in the new capital were granted officials titles. After the king and his relatives, officials were powerful. They held numbers of ''phrai'', commoners who were recruited as forces. Officials in Thonburi mainly dealt with military as well as 'business' affairs.\n\nDespite Taksin's successes, by 1779 King Taksin was in trouble. He was recorded in the Rattanahosin's gazettes and missionaries's accounts as becoming maniacal, insulting senior Buddhist monks,  proclaiming himself to be a ''[[Four stages of enlightenment#Stream-enterer|sotapanna]]'' or divine figure. Foreign missionaries were also purged from times to times. His officials, mainly ethnic Chinese, were divided into factions, one of which still supported him but the other did not. The economy was also in turmoil, famine ravaged the land, corruption and abuses of office were rampant, the monarch attempted to restore order by harsh punishments leading to the execution of large numbers of officials and merchants, mostly ethnic Chinese which in turn led to growing discontent among officials.\n\nIn 1782 Thonburi sent a huge army to subjugate nearby kingdoms such as Cambodia and Lao principalities again, but while they were away, a rebellion led by a powerful official broke out. The rebels eventually controlled the capital, forcing the king to step down. It is said that Taksin was allowed to be a monk. Later, the general, Phraya Chakri, the commander-in-chief of the army in Cambodia, who had wide popular support among officials, was offered the throne to King Taksin's commander in chief as he marched back from Cambodia and officially deposed king Taksin from monk-hood.

The kingdom was founded by [[Taksin|King Taksin the Great]], who relocated the capital to [[Thonburi]]. The kingdom of Thonburi existed from 1767 to 1782. In 1782, [[King Rama I]] founded the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]] and relocated the capital to [[Bangkok]] on the other side of the [[Chao Phraya River]], thus bringing the Thonburi kingdom to an end. The city of Thonburi remained an independent town and province until it was merged into [[Bangkok]] in 1971.\n\n==Reestablishment of Siamese authority==\n[[Image:KingTaksin's coronation.jpg|thumb|left|Taksin's coronation at Thonburi (Bangkok) 28-December\u20131768]]\nIn 1767, after dominating southeast Asia for almost 400 years, the [[Ayutthaya kingdom]] was destroyed. The royal palace and the city were burnt to the ground. The territory was occupied by the [[Burma|Burmese]] army and local leaders declared themselves overlords including the lords of Sakwangburi, [[Pimai|Phimai]], [[Chanthaburi]], and [[Nakhon Si Thammarat]]. [[Taksin|Chao Tak]], a nobleman of Chinese descent and a capable military leader, proceeded to make himself a lord by [[right of conquest]],  beginning with the legendary sack of [[Chanthaburi]]. Based at Chanthaburi, Chao Tak raised troops and resources, and sent a fleet up the [[Chao Phraya]] to take the fort of [[Thonburi]]. In the same year, Chao Tak was able to retake Ayutthaya from the Burmese only seven months after the fall of the city.<ref>\u0e08\u0e23\u0e23\u0e22\u0e32 \u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e0a\u0e34\u0e15\u0e42\u0e23\u0e21\u0e23\u0e31\u0e19.

The Burmese armies arrived through [[Amphoe Sai Yok|Sai Yok]] and laid siege on the Bang Kung camp \u2013 the camp for Taksin's Chinese troops \u2013 in modern [[Samut Songkhram]] Province. Taksin hurriedly sent one of his generals [[Maha Sura Singhanat|Boonma]] to command the fleet to Bang Kung to relieve the siege. Siamese armies encircled the Burmese siege and defeated them.\n\nAyutthaya, the center of Siamese authority for hundreds of years, was so devastated that it could not be used as a government center. Tak founded the new city of [[Thonburi|Thonburi Sri Mahasamut]] on the west bank of Chao Phraya river. The construction took place for about a year and Tak crowned himself in late 1768 as King Sanphet but he was known to people as King Taksin \u2013 a combination of his title and personal name. Taksin crowned himself as a King of Ayutthaya to signify the continuation to ancient glories.<ref>David K. Wyatt. Thailand: A Short History. Yale University Press</ref>\n\n==Reunification and expansion==\nThere were still local [[warlord]]s competing for Siam. Taksin marched first in 1768 to [[Pitsanulok|Phitsanulok]] to subjugate the Lord of Phitsanulok who ruled over Upper Chao Phraya Basin. Taksin was injured during the campaign and had to retreat. The war readily weakened Phitsanulok and then it was in turn subjugated by the Lord of [[Sakwangburi]]. The same year Taksin sent [[Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke|Thong Duang]] and [[Maha Sura Singhanat|Boonma]] to tame the Prince Theppipit \u2013 the ruler of [[Phimai]] to the north of [[Nakhon Ratchasima]] on the [[Khorat Plateau]]. The prince was a son of [[Borommakot]] and was defeated by Thonburi armies. Theppipit fled to [[Vientiene|Vientiane]] but was captured and then executed.\n\nIn 1769, Taksin sent ''Phraya'' Chakri south to subjugate the Lord of Nakhon Si Thammarat. The lord fled to [[Pattani]] but was returned to Taksin, who reinstalled him back as the ruler of Nakhon Si Thammarat under Taksin's governance.\n\nPrince [[Ang Non]] the [[Uparaja]] of [[Cambodia]] fled to Thonburi in 1769 after his conflicts with King [[Narairaja]] for Siamese supports. Taksin then took this opportunity to request tributary from Cambodia, which Narairaja refused. Taksin sent [[Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke|''Phraya'' Abhay Ronnarit]] and [[Maha Sura Singhanat|''Phraya'' Anuchit Racha]] to subjugate Cambodia, taking [[Siemreap|Siem Reap]] and [[Battambang]]. But Taksin's absence from the capital (in wars with Nakhon Si Thammarat) shook the political stability and the two generals decided to retreat to Thonburi.\n\nBy this time, the only rival to Thonburi authority was the Sakwangburi lordship led by the powerful monk [[Chao Phra Faang]]. Chao Phra Faang\u2019s domain encompassed the northernmost territories bordering [[Lanna]] to [[Nakhon Sawan]] to the south as the result of annexation of Phitsanulok lordship in 1768. In 1770, Chao Phra Faang sent reinforcements southwards reaching [[Chainat|Chai Nat]]. Taksin perceived this action as threats and decided to invade Sakwangburi beforehand. The royal fleet marched upstream the Chao Phraya River and took Phitsanulok with ease. Taksin then divided the armies into the east one led by Boonma and the west one led by [[Phraya Pichai|''Phraya'' Pichai]] to be joined at Sakwangburi. Sakwangburi quickly fell after three days and Chao Phra Faang went lost.\n\nTaksin stayed at Phitsanulok to oversee the census and levy of northern population. He appointed Boonma to ''Chao Phraya'' Surasi as the governor of Phitsanulok and all northern cities and ''Phraya'' Abhay Ronnarit to ''Chao Phraya'' Chakri the chancellor.\n\nLater in 1771, Taksin decided to finish off the Cambodian campaign by assigning ''Chao Phraya'' Chakri command of land forces with Prince Ang Non and Taksin himself went by fleet. The Siamese took various Cambodian cities and drove Narairaja out of the throne. Ang Non was installed as Reamraja and Narairaja became the Uparaja with the Cambodian court paying tribute to Thonburi.\n\n==Wars with Burma==\n{{further|Burma\u2013Thailand relations|Burmese\u2013Siamese War (1765\u201367)#Geopolitical situation to the next war (1768\u20131776)}}\nTaksin had consolidated the old Siamese kingdom with new base at Thonburi. However, the Burmese were still ready to wage massive wars to bring the Siamese down again. From their base at [[Chiang Mai]], they invaded [[Sawankhalok District|Sawankhalok]] in 1770 but the Siamese were able to repel. This realized Taksin the importance of Lanna as the base of resources for the Burmese to attack northern territories. If Lanna was brought under Siamese control then the Burmese threats would by annihilated.\n\nAt the time Lanna, centered on Chiang Mai, was ruled by a Burmese general Paw Myunguaun.  He was the general who led the invasion of Sawankhalok in 1770 but was countered by ''Chao Phraya'' Surasi\u2019s armies from Phitsanulok. In the same year, the Siamese pioneered a little invasion of Chiang Mai and failed to gain any fruitful results.\n\nIn 1772, Paw Thupla, another Burmese general who had been in wars in [[Laos]], headed west and attack [[Phichai District|Phichai]] and [[Uttaradit]]. The armies of Phitsanulok once again repelled the Burmese invasions. They came again in 1773 and this time ''Phraya'' Phichai made his legendary sword break.\n\n===Wars over Lan na===\n{{see also|Burmese\u2013Siamese War (1775\u201376)}}\n[[File:Battle of Bangkeo.jpg|thumb|250px|Battle of Bangkeo in Ratchaburi]]\nIn 1774, Taksin ordered ''Chao Phraya'' Chakri and ''Chao Phraya'' Surasi to invade Chiang Mai. After nearly 200 years of Burmese rule, Lanna passed to the Siamese hands. The two ''Chao Phraya''s were able to take Chiang Mai with the help of local insurgents against Burma and Taksin appointed them the local rulers: Phraya Chabaan as Phraya Vichianprakarn the Lord of Chiangmai, Phraya [[Kawila]] as the Lord of Lampang, and Phraya Vaiwongsa as Lord of Lampoon. All the lordships paid tribute to Thonburi. Paw Myunguaun and the Burmese authority retreated to [[Lanna|Chiang Saen]].\n\nDuring Taksin\u2019s northern campaigns, the Burmese armies took the opportunity to invade Thonburi through Ta Din Daeng. The Burmese encamped at [[Bangkaew]] but were surrounded by the Siamese armies commanded by Taksin. For more than a month the Burmese had been locked in the siege and thousand of them died.<ref>http://www.bloggang.com/viewdiary.php?id=secret-world&month=03-2010&date=04&group=1&gblog=85</ref> Another thousand became captives to the Siamese.\n\nIn 1775 there came the hugest invasion of the Burmese led by [[Maha Thiha Thura]]. Instead of dividing the forces invading through various ways, Maha Thiha Thura amassed the troop of 30,000 as a whole directly towards Phitsanulok whose inhabitants were only 10,000 in number. Paw Thupla and Paw Myunguaun from Chiang Saen attempted to retake Chiang Mai but were halted by the two ''Chao Phraya''s, who after Chiang Mai hurried back to Phitsanulok to defend the city. The engagements occurred near Phitsanulok.\n\nMaha Thiha Thura directed the troops at Phitsanulok so immensely that the Siamese were about to fall. He cut down the supply lines and attacked the royal army. The two ''Chao Phraya''s decided to abandon Phitsanulok. The Burmese entered the city with victory but due to the death of Hsinbyushin the Burmese king the same year. They had to retreat.\n\nAfter the death of the Burmese king Hsinbyushin the Burmese were plunged in their own dynastic struggles. In 1776, the new monarch [[Singu Min|Singusa]] sent Maha Thiha Thura to invade Lanna again with such a huge army that Lord Vichianprakarn of Chiang Mai had to abandon the city. ''Chao Phraya'' Surasi and Lord Kawila of Lampang retook Chiang Mai from the Burmese but decided to left the city abandoned as there was no population to fill the city. No further Burmese invasions came as Singu staged his dynastic purges on the princes and Maha Thiha Thura himself.\n\n==Expansions ==\nIn 1776, a governor of Nangrong (modern [[Nakhon Nayok]]) had a row with the governor of [[Nakhon Ratchasima]] the head city of the region. The governor then sought supports from King [[Sayakumane]] of [[Kingdom of Champasak|Champasak]]. This became a ''casus bellum'' for Taksin to send ''Chao Phraya'' Chakri to conquer Champasak. King Sayakumane fled but was captured and detained in Thonburi for two years until he was sent to rule his kingdom again in 1780 paying tribute to Thonburi. The Champasak campaign earned Chakri the title ''Somdet Chao Phraya'' Maha Kasatseuk. Taksin invented the title ''Somdet Chao Phraya'' for a mandarin with equal honor as a royalty.\n\nIn 1778, a Laotian mandarin named Phra Wo sought Siamese supports against King Bunsan of [[Vientiene|Vientiane]] but was killed by the Laotian king. Taksin then dispatched the troops in 1779 led by the two famous brothers commanders, Phraya Chakri and his brother, Phraya Surasi to subjugate Vientiane. At the same time King Suriyavong of [[Luang Prabang]] submitted himself to Thonburi and joined the invasion of Vientiane. King Bunsan fled and hid in the forests but later gave up himself to the Siamese. The Vientiane royal family was deported to Thonburi as hostages. Thonburi forces took two valuable Buddha images, the symbolic icons of Vientiane \u2013 the [[Emerald Buddha]] and [[Phra Bang]] to Thonburi. Then all of the three Laotian kingdoms became Siamese tributaries and remained under Siamese rule for another hundred years.\n\n=== Territory ===\n[[File:Map of the Rattanakosin Kingdom.svg|thumb|130px|right|Thailand's territory, during Taksin's reign.]]\nThe kingdom under Taksin rule was much smaller than it was in Ayutthaya times. It included the following provinces : [[Thon Buri|Thonburi]], [[Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]], [[Ang Thong]], [[Singburi]], [[Lopburi]], [[Uthai Thani]], [[Nakhon Sawan]], [[Chachoengsao]], [[Prachinburi]], [[Nakhon Nayok]], [[Chonburi (city)|Chonburi]], [[Rayong]], [[Chantaburi|Chanthaburi]], [[Trat]], [[Amphoe Nakhon Chai Si|Nakhon Chai Si]], [[Nakhon Pathom]], [[Suphanburi]], [[Ratchaburi]], [[Samut Sakhon]], [[Samut Songkhram]], [[Phetchaburi]], [[Kanchanaburi]], and [[Prachuap Khiri Khan]].\n\nThroughout his reign, King Taksin carried out his policy of expansion.\n\nIn the north, including the whole of Lanna. Burmese was driven out. Local allies became Thonburi's subjugation.\n\nIn the south, including [[Syburi]] (present-day [[Kedah]]) and [[Trengganu]] in [[Malaysia]].\n\nIn the east, Cambodia was subjugated. His forces even attacked [[South Vietnam]]\n\nIn the northeast, including Vientiane, [[Phuan people|Phuan]], Luang Prabang, and Hua Phan Ha Thang Hok.\n\nIn the southeast, including Phutthaimat ([[H\u00e0 Ti\u00ean]] in [[Vietnam]] today).\n\nIn the west, as far as [[Mergui]] and [[Tenasserim Division|Tenasserim]] in [[Myanmar]] today leading to the [[Indian Ocean]].<ref name=\"KING TAKSIN DAY\">[http://webhost.m-culture.go.th/culture01/en/index.php/articles/30-the-important-days-in-thailand/50-king-taksin-day.html KING TAKSIN DAY] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20110428042550/http://webhost.m-culture.go.th/culture01/en/index.php/articles/30-the-important-days-in-thailand/50-king-taksin-day.html |date=28 April 2011 }} ''webhost.m-culture.go.th'' Retrieved 28 December 2007</ref><ref>W.A.R.Wood, pp. 251\u2013252</ref>\n==Military ==\n{{Main|History of the Thai armed forces before 1852}}\n{{Empty section|date=May 2018}}\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Wat Arun Ratchawararam Ratchawaramahawihan.jpg|thumb|280px|right|[[Wat Arun]], [[Thon Buri District|Thonburi]]]]\nYears of warfare and the Burmese invasions prevented any peasants to engage in agricultural activities. Majority of people had been deported to Burma in the fall of Ayutthaya in 1767 and the lack of manpower became the source of problems. Taksin had tried his best to encourage people to come out of forest hidings and promote farming. He promulgated the [[Conscription Tattooing]] in 1773 which left a permanent mark on commoners' bodies, preventing them from fleeing or moving. The practice continued well into Rattanakosin times until the abolition of levy itself by King [[Chulalongkorn]] later. As Taksin was from a Chinese merchant family, he sold his both royal and familial properties and belongings to subsidize the production by giving money off to people. This proved to be a temporary relief for such an economic decline. Nevertheless, the Siamese economy after the catastrophes needed time to rehabilitate.\n\nTaksin himself also commissioned trade missions to the neighbouring countries to bring Siam back to outside world, mainly with China. He dispatched several missions with tributes to the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] in 1781 to resume diplomatic and commercial relationships.\n\n==Political and economic troubles==\n[[File:Royal Thai Navy HQ, view form Phra Prang of Wat Arun.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Phra Racha Wang Derm]], the former royal palace of King Taksin, now used as the [[Royal Thai Navy]]'s HQ, view form Phra Prang of [[Wat Arun]], Thonburi, Bangkok.]]\nThonburi began forming its society. Taksin gathered resources by wars and deals with Chinese merchants. Major groups of people in Thonburi were local Thais, ''phrai'', or 'commoners', Chinese, Laotians, Khmers, Mons. Some powerful Chinese merchants trading in the new capital were granted officials titles. After the king and his relatives, officials were powerful. They held numbers of ''phrai'', commoners who were recruited as forces. Officials in Thonburi mainly dealt with military as well as 'business' affairs.\n\nDespite Taksin's successes, by 1779 King Taksin was in trouble. He was recorded in the Rattanahosin's gazettes and missionaries's accounts as becoming maniacal, insulting senior Buddhist monks,  proclaiming himself to be a ''[[Four stages of enlightenment#Stream-enterer|sotapanna]]'' or divine figure. Foreign missionaries were also purged from times to times. His officials, mainly ethnic Chinese, were divided into factions, one of which still supported him but the other did not. The economy was also in turmoil, famine ravaged the land, corruption and abuses of office were rampant, the monarch attempted to restore order by harsh punishments leading to the execution of large numbers of officials and merchants, mostly ethnic Chinese which in turn led to growing discontent among officials.\n\nIn 1782 Thonburi sent a huge army to subjugate nearby kingdoms such as Cambodia and Lao principalities again, but while they were away, a rebellion led by a powerful official broke out. The rebels eventually controlled the capital, forcing the king to step down. It is said that Taksin was allowed to be a monk. Later, the general, Phraya Chakri, the commander-in-chief of the army in Cambodia, who had wide popular support among officials, was offered the throne to King Taksin's commander in chief as he marched back from Cambodia and officially deposed king Taksin from monk-hood. Taksin was secretly executed shortly after.\n\n==Rattanakosin establishment==\n{{see also|Rattanakosin Kingdom}}\nAfter the execution, the commander in chief assumed the throne of Thonburi kingdom as King Ramathibodi or Rama I.\nKing Rama I moved his royal seat across the Chao Phraya river to the village of Bang-Koh (meaning \"place of the island\") which he had built.

In the past, there were furniture factories, engine and pump works, and other industrial works located within the town. Shippensburg is the home of [[the Beistle Company]], the oldest manufacturer of decorations and party goods in the U.S. It is also the location of Pague and Fegan, the oldest continuously operated [[hardware store]] in Pennsylvania.{{cn|date=October 2019}} In May 2012, [[Volvo Construction Equipment]] began a $100 million expansion project to bring its American headquarters to Shippensburg.<ref>[http://www.abc27.com/story/18150802/volvo-expansion-underway-in-shippensburg \"Volvo expansion underway in Shippensburg\"], ABC27 News</ref>\n\n[[Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania]], one of 14 universities of the [[Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education]], is located just north of the borough limits in [[Shippensburg Township, Cumberland County, Pennsylvania|Shippensburg Township]].\n\n==History==\nShippensburg is the oldest community of the [[Cumberland Valley]], and the second oldest west of the [[Susquehanna River]] in Pennsylvania (after [[York, Pennsylvania|York]] to the east). In July 1730, 12 [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] families came to the site of the present-day Shippensburg and built cabin homes along Burd's Run. Shippensburg began as the western outpost of colonial settlement.\n\nThe village received its name from [[Edward Shippen III|Edward Shippen]], a prominent resident of [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]] (and onetime mayor of [[Philadelphia]]) who obtained the patent to the land from the heirs of [[William Penn]]. Edward Shippen's granddaughter, [[Peggy Shippen]], was historically notable as the wife of General [[Benedict Arnold]], who betrayed the Continental Army by defecting to the British during the [[American Revolutionary War]].\n\nIn 1735, Samuel Perry built the [[Widow Piper's Tavern]], which stands at the southwest corner of East King Street and Queen Street. This building was selected as the place for the first Cumberland County Courts in 1750 and 1751. The building has been restored and serves today as the home of the Shippensburg Civic Club.\n\nOn July 9, 1755, Edward Morris, the governor of Shippensburg, ordered that a fort be built after he learned of [[Braddock Expedition|General Braddock's defeat]] at the hands of the French and Indians. His intent was to provide protection for the troops and colonists during the [[French and Indian War]]. Over the next year, several buildings, a {{convert|70|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep}} well, and a log [[palisade]] were built. Fort Morris was garrisoned until the early 1760s but preserved for several more years due to the efforts of Edward Shippen. There is also a record that an officer and eighteen provincial troops were stationed in Shippensburg during the winter of 1763-1764. On March 24, 1761, Shippen wrote, \"I desire everybody in Shippensburg to take care of ye Fort for I will suffer a log of it to be thrown down on any pretense whatever.\"\n\n[[Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania]] was founded in 1871 as a [[normal school]].\n\nIn 2009, a team of archaeologists reported they had discovered the site of Fort Morris on Burd Street. Among the artifacts found were pottery, coins, buttons, musket balls, flints and musket parts. Some of these artifacts are housed in Shearer Hall on the Shippensburg University campus, while others are currently on display at the Shippensburg Historical Society.\n\nThe [[Shippensburg Historic District]], [[Dykeman's Spring]], the [[Benjamin Blythe Homestead]], [[Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania|Cumberland Valley State Normal School Historic District]], the [[Shippen House]], and [[Widow Piper's Tavern]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n==General information==\nLocal telephone exchanges in Shippensburg are 300, 360, 477, 530, and 532.\n\nThe [[PIAA]] high school track and field and softball championships are held at Shippensburg University.\n\n==Geography==\nShippensburg is located in south-central Pennsylvania at {{coord|40|2|58|N|77|31|26|W|type:city}} (40.049453, -77.523830),<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> primarily in Cumberland County, but extending west into Franklin County.\n\n[[U.S. Route 11]] passes through the center of town as King Street; US 11 leads northeast {{convert|20|mi}} to [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania|Carlisle]], the Cumberland County seat, and southwest {{convert|11|mi}} to [[Chambersburg, Pennsylvania|Chambersburg]], the Franklin County seat.

In the past, there were furniture factories, engine and pump works, and other industrial works located within the town. Shippensburg is the home of [[the Beistle Company]], the oldest manufacturer of decorations and party goods in the U.S. It is also the location of Pague and Fegan, the oldest continuously operated [[hardware store]] in Pennsylvania.{{cn|date=October 2019}} In May 2012, [[Volvo Construction Equipment]] began a $100 million expansion project to bring its American headquarters to Shippensburg.<ref>[http://www.abc27.com/story/18150802/volvo-expansion-underway-in-shippensburg \"Volvo expansion underway in Shippensburg\"], ABC27 News</ref>\n\n[[Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania]], one of 14 universities of the [[Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education]], is located just north of the borough limits in [[Shippensburg Township, Cumberland County, Pennsylvania|Shippensburg Township]].\n\n==History==\nShippensburg is the oldest community of the [[Cumberland Valley]], and the second oldest west of the [[Susquehanna River]] in Pennsylvania (after [[York, Pennsylvania|York]] to the east). In July 1730, 12 [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] families came to the site of the present-day Shippensburg and built cabin homes along Burd's Run. Shippensburg began as the western outpost of colonial settlement.\n\nThe village received its name from [[Edward Shippen III|Edward Shippen]], a prominent resident of [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]] (and onetime mayor of [[Philadelphia]]) who obtained the patent to the land from the heirs of [[William Penn]]. Edward Shippen's granddaughter, [[Peggy Shippen]], was historically notable as the wife of General [[Benedict Arnold]], who betrayed the Continental Army by defecting to the British during the [[American Revolutionary War]].\n\nIn 1735, Samuel Perry built the [[Widow Piper's Tavern]], which stands at the southwest corner of East King Street and Queen Street. This building was selected as the place for the first Cumberland County Courts in 1750 and 1751. The building has been restored and serves today as the home of the Shippensburg Civic Club.\n\nOn July 9, 1755, Edward Morris, the governor of Shippensburg, ordered that a fort be built after he learned of [[Braddock Expedition|General Braddock's defeat]] at the hands of the French and Indians. His intent was to provide protection for the troops and colonists during the [[French and Indian War]]. Over the next year, several buildings, a {{convert|70|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep}} well, and a log [[palisade]] were built. Fort Morris was garrisoned until the early 1760s but preserved for several more years due to the efforts of Edward Shippen. There is also a record that an officer and eighteen provincial troops were stationed in Shippensburg during the winter of 1763-1764. On March 24, 1761, Shippen wrote, \"I desire everybody in Shippensburg to take care of ye Fort for I will suffer a log of it to be thrown down on any pretense whatever.\"\n\n[[Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania]] was founded in 1871 as a [[normal school]].\n\nIn 2009, a team of archaeologists reported they had discovered the site of Fort Morris on Burd Street. Among the artifacts found were pottery, coins, buttons, musket balls, flints and musket parts. Some of these artifacts are housed in Shearer Hall on the Shippensburg University campus, while others are currently on display at the Shippensburg Historical Society.\n\nThe [[Shippensburg Historic District]], [[Dykeman's Spring]], the [[Benjamin Blythe Homestead]], [[Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania|Cumberland Valley State Normal School Historic District]], the [[Shippen House]], and [[Widow Piper's Tavern]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n==General information==\nLocal telephone exchanges in Shippensburg are 300, 360, 477, 530, and 532.\n\nThe [[PIAA]] high school track and field and softball championships are held at Shippensburg University.\n\n==Geography==\nShippensburg is located in south-central Pennsylvania at {{coord|40|2|58|N|77|31|26|W|type:city}} (40.049453, -77.523830),<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> primarily in Cumberland County, but extending west into Franklin County.\n\n[[U.S. Route 11]] passes through the center of town as King Street; US 11 leads northeast {{convert|20|mi}} to [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania|Carlisle]], the Cumberland County seat, and southwest {{convert|11|mi}} to [[Chambersburg, Pennsylvania|Chambersburg]], the Franklin County seat.

It was begun in 1909 by the Taylor Land Company for those residents in [[Baltimore]] who wanted a place outside the city limits to perhaps grow a garden or to pursue some other rural activity. Land was cheap, and sales were enhanced by a promotional pamphlet.\n\nHenry Guttenberger built the first general store in Essex in 1910 on the corner of [[Eastern Avenue (Baltimore)|Eastern Avenue]] and Mace Avenue. Between 1911 and 1912, the Taylor Land Company donated the lots for Essex Methodist and St. John's Lutheran churches. They also donated the land where the volunteer fire department built their station. The permanent fire station opened in 1921.\n\nWith the ever-growing population came the need to build schools. The elementary school opened in 1925 with 400 students. Essex Community College, now [[Community College of Baltimore County|CCBC-Essex]], was founded in 1957. Classes were first held at [[Kenwood High School (Maryland)|Kenwood High School]], with fifty part-time and nine full-time students. In 1961, the college moved to Dorsey Avenue, and in 1968 moved to its present location, in [[Rossville, Maryland|Rossville]]. This site was owned by the Mace family, and the family burial plot is maintained and protected by the college.\n\nA fire in August 1957 destroyed an entire block of businesses on Eastern Boulevard, and the business district never fully recovered from that catastrophe. The ten-alarm blaze caused a half million dollars in damages, and, in the time it took to repair the buildings, new shopping centers were built, changing the buying habits of consumers.<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:essex_fire.jpg|thumb|Essex Fire - 1957]] -->\n\nThe [[Glenn L. Martin Company]] was the single biggest reason for the rapid growth of the area. Employment at the company peaked at more than 53,000 workers during [[World War II]]. In the years following, industry in the area dwindled, and much of the original Glenn L. Martin facility became the property of the State, including [[Martin State Airport]]. The remaining [[aerospace]] business followed a progression of corporate mergers and today is owned and operated by [[Lockheed Martin]].\n\nAnother important company was Eastern Rolling Mill, which opened in 1919. The plant, at the head of the [[Back River (Maryland)|Back River]], produced carbon [[sheet steel]]. In 1944, Eastern merged with Industrial Stainless Steel, Inc. to form Easco. The plant then merged with the British company Avesta-Sheffield in the early 1990s, finally shutting down operations in the late 1990s.\n\nToday, there is interest in revitalizing the Essex area by including it in government-sponsored [[empowerment zone]]s. Many neighborhoods have begun a \"clean-up\" of their areas, hoping to transform Essex into a place that will be ready to move into the twenty-first century.  Improvements include removal of run-down, low-income housing, including the Tall Trees Community and the Riverdale Community; new medians and pavement on Eastern Avenue; a new single family home community called Waterview; and the auctioning of Middle River Station for commercial area.  [[Maryland Route 43|MD 43 Extended]] has opened which connects the old waterfront community and Carroll Island area with the booming [[White Marsh, Maryland|White Marsh]] commercial area.\n\n[[Ballestone Mansion]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1975.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|2008a}}</ref>\n\nOn August 2, 2009, the community of Essex celebrated its 100th birthday with a party at Cox's Point Park on Riverside Drive. It featured live music by Joey McCann, Mickey Light, Maria Rose, Don \"Big Daddy Country\" Cox, and others.\n\n<small>Sources: Baltimore County Public Library </small>\n\n==Geography==\nEssex is located at {{Coord|39|18|28|N|76|27|6|W|type:city}} (39.307737, &minus;76.451710).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the CDP has a total area of {{convert|30.8|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|24.0|km2|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|6.8|km2|order=flip}}, or 22.16%, is water.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://factfinder.census.gov |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212221153/http://factfinder.census.gov/main.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 12, 2020 |title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Essex CDP, Maryland |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder |accessdate=February 23, 2012 }}</ref> The town is on mostly flat to gently rolling terrain, transitioning to marshland close to the [[Chesapeake Bay]].\n\n==Demographics==\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web |url=http://factfinder.census.gov |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212221153/http://factfinder.census.gov/main.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2020-02-12 |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2008-01-31 |title=American FactFinder }}</ref> of 2000, there were 39,078 people, 15,952 households, and 10,336 families residing in the CDP.

The population was 39,262 at the 2010 census.<ref name=\"Census 2010\">{{Cite web |url=http://factfinder.census.gov |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212221153/http://factfinder.census.gov/main.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 12, 2020 |title=Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (DP-1): Essex CDP, Maryland |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder |accessdate=February 23, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nOriginally, Essex was ten blocks, running from Mace Avenue to Marlyn Avenue. It was begun in 1909 by the Taylor Land Company for those residents in [[Baltimore]] who wanted a place outside the city limits to perhaps grow a garden or to pursue some other rural activity. Land was cheap, and sales were enhanced by a promotional pamphlet.\n\nHenry Guttenberger built the first general store in Essex in 1910 on the corner of [[Eastern Avenue (Baltimore)|Eastern Avenue]] and Mace Avenue. Between 1911 and 1912, the Taylor Land Company donated the lots for Essex Methodist and St. John's Lutheran churches. They also donated the land where the volunteer fire department built their station. The permanent fire station opened in 1921.\n\nWith the ever-growing population came the need to build schools. The elementary school opened in 1925 with 400 students. Essex Community College, now [[Community College of Baltimore County|CCBC-Essex]], was founded in 1957. Classes were first held at [[Kenwood High School (Maryland)|Kenwood High School]], with fifty part-time and nine full-time students. In 1961, the college moved to Dorsey Avenue, and in 1968 moved to its present location, in [[Rossville, Maryland|Rossville]]. This site was owned by the Mace family, and the family burial plot is maintained and protected by the college.\n\nA fire in August 1957 destroyed an entire block of businesses on Eastern Boulevard, and the business district never fully recovered from that catastrophe. The ten-alarm blaze caused a half million dollars in damages, and, in the time it took to repair the buildings, new shopping centers were built, changing the buying habits of consumers.<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:essex_fire.jpg|thumb|Essex Fire - 1957]] -->\n\nThe [[Glenn L. Martin Company]] was the single biggest reason for the rapid growth of the area. Employment at the company peaked at more than 53,000 workers during [[World War II]]. In the years following, industry in the area dwindled, and much of the original Glenn L. Martin facility became the property of the State, including [[Martin State Airport]]. The remaining [[aerospace]] business followed a progression of corporate mergers and today is owned and operated by [[Lockheed Martin]].\n\nAnother important company was Eastern Rolling Mill, which opened in 1919. The plant, at the head of the [[Back River (Maryland)|Back River]], produced carbon [[sheet steel]]. In 1944, Eastern merged with Industrial Stainless Steel, Inc. to form Easco. The plant then merged with the British company Avesta-Sheffield in the early 1990s, finally shutting down operations in the late 1990s.\n\nToday, there is interest in revitalizing the Essex area by including it in government-sponsored [[empowerment zone]]s. Many neighborhoods have begun a \"clean-up\" of their areas, hoping to transform Essex into a place that will be ready to move into the twenty-first century.  Improvements include removal of run-down, low-income housing, including the Tall Trees Community and the Riverdale Community; new medians and pavement on Eastern Avenue; a new single family home community called Waterview; and the auctioning of Middle River Station for commercial area.  [[Maryland Route 43|MD 43 Extended]] has opened which connects the old waterfront community and Carroll Island area with the booming [[White Marsh, Maryland|White Marsh]] commercial area.\n\n[[Ballestone Mansion]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1975.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|2008a}}</ref>\n\nOn August 2, 2009, the community of Essex celebrated its 100th birthday with a party at Cox's Point Park on Riverside Drive.

The son of Oscar Erickson and Myrtle Chatterson, he had an interest and talent for painting from an early age. Like his father, he served in the [[Canadian Intelligence Corps|Canadian Army Intelligence Corps]] during [[World War II]]. It was during this time that he became familiar with the Japanese language, going on to serve in India, Celyon, and Malaysia.<ref name=\":2\" /> This experience fostered his interest in the art and philosophy of these areas.\n\nErickson\u2019s original intent was to enter into a career in the diplomatic service, however this changed after he stumbled upon an article about [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]. Inspired by Wright\u2019s studio and works, Arthur pursued a career in architecture.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.aefoundation.ca/arthur|title=Arthur Erickson Foundation - Arthur|website=www.aefoundation.ca|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> Erickson\u2019s post-secondary studies included an undergraduate degree at the [[University of British Columbia]], followed by the [[McGill School of Architecture|School of Architecture]] at [[McGill University]]. After graduating from McGill in 1950, Erickson was granted a travel scholarship and traveled in the Mediterranean, Middle East, and Japan. Travelling to these areas allowed him to deepen his exploration of climate and style in their relationship to architecture. Erickson also became a professor, teaching at the [[University of Oregon]] and subsequently the [[University of British Columbia]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.the-peak.ca/2014/06/the-concrete-acropolis/ |title= The Concrete Acropolis |accessdate=June 9, 2014 |last=Hill |first=Max |date=2014-06-09 |publisher=The Peak}}</ref> After teaching, he worked for a few years at [[Thompson Berwick and Pratt and Partners]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Stouck |first=David |date=Sep 6, 2013 |title=Arthur Erickson: An Architect's Life |url= |location= |publisher=Douglas & McIntyre |page= |isbn=978-1771000116 |accessdate= }}</ref> before he went on to design houses in partnership with Geoffrey Massey. In 1963, Erickson and Massey submitted the winning design for [[Simon Fraser University]].<ref name=\"G&M\">[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/the-greatest-architect-we-have-ever-produced/article1147768/ Martin, Sandra. \"The greatest architect we have ever produced,\" ''The Globe and Mail'', Friday, May 22, 2009.]</ref>\n\n== Style and method ==\nWhen he started his career in 1953,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Sabatino|first=Michelangelo|date=August 2008|title=Arthur Erickson and essential tectonics|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13602360802328065|journal=The Journal of Architecture|language=en|volume=13|issue=4|pages=493\u2013514|doi=10.1080/13602360802328065|issn=1360-2365}}</ref> Erickson's earlier buildings were often modernist concrete structures designed to respond to the natural conditions of their locations, especially climate. Due to his travels to the Far East, Erickson was fond of integrating light and water into his designs, along with the characteristic horizontal elements and terraces that came from the vernacular architecture of that region.<ref name=\":0\" /> Many buildings, such as the [[Museum of Anthropology at UBC|Museum of Anthropology]] in Vancouver, are inspired by the [[Timber framing|post and beam]] architecture of the Coastal [[First Nations]]. The tectonics of the post-and-beam style can also be found in the construction of Asian temples and the Canadian and American log cabin, further linking his architectural style to his travels during his education. Additionally, Erickson is also known for numerous [[Futurist architecture|futuristic]] designs such as the [[Fresno City Hall]] and the Biological Sciences Building at the [[University of California, Irvine]]. His work balanced the style of modernism with an integration of the surrounding natural environment.\n\n== Significant works ==\n\n=== Simon Fraser University (Burnaby, BC) ===\n[[File:Simon Fraser University.jpg|thumb|[[Simon Fraser University]], [[Burnaby]], B.C.]]\nAs mentioned above, Erickson\u2019s partnership with Geoffrey Massey lead to the winning design submitted for Simon Fraser University. Located on [[Burnaby Mountain]], the unfinished concrete blends in with the surrounding geography in colour but not in shape. When viewed from above in plan, the campus forms a geometric contrast to the snowy mountains of its context. The site and scale of the project is reminiscent of utopian designs from French architects in the late eighteenth century such as [[\u00c9tienne-Louis Boull\u00e9e|Etienne-Louis Bouillee]]<ref name=\":0\" />[[\u00c9tienne-Louis Boull\u00e9e|.]] The design featured an indoor plaza with massive skylights in order to respond sensitively to Vancouver\u2019s rainy, cool climate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Arthur-Erickson|title=Arthur Erickson {{!}} Canadian architect|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> The university provides a balance of the inherent character of British Columbia while still exploring the structural ambitions of the modernist period in the 1960s. Erickson and Massey's project was internationally acclaimed and allowed Arthur\u2019s career to become more distinguished while opening the door to new possibilities.\n\n=== Museum of Anthropology at the University of British Columbia (Vancouver, BC) ===\n[[File:UBC Museum of Anthropology 12.jpg|thumb|[[Museum of Anthropology at UBC]], Vancouver, B.C.]]\nBuilt in 1976, it was created as an inclusion to the campus at the [[University of British Columbia]]. This building blends methods of reinforced concrete and the traditional post-and-beam construction to articulate the structure throughout the project. Oversized beams evoke a monumental feeling in many of Erickson's projects, calling on the size and scale of the trees found in the surrounding context. This project is designed to display the aboriginal art of the province, and is well known for Erickson\u2019s use of concrete piers and large stretches of glass. By using concrete beams to represent dematerialized logs and opening up the main atrium through expanses of glass, Erickson contrasts the traditional notion of post-and-beam construction to integrate these characteristics into a modernistic building.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Robson Square (Vancouver, BC) ===\n[[File:Robson Square waterfall 2018.jpg|thumb|221x221px|[[Robson Square]], Vancouver, B.C.]]\nBuilt in Vancouver in 1979 as a large civic center, Erickson\u2019s design included waterfalls, a roof garden, several plazas, and stairs with ramps integrated within. This complex is one of the few in North America that integrates everything from public space and landscape to the surrounding buildings, from the art gallery to courts of law. As time goes on, more additions are being created that seem to contrast the original intent of the design. Glass barriers were installed near the waterfall, preventing people from getting close to it, as well as on the edges of planters to prevent people from being able to sit on them. It has also since lost the outdoor restaurants, cinema, and large auditorium that once existed on the site.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Smedmen|first=Lisa|url=https://search-proquest-com.lib.ryerson.ca/docview/359530336?accountid=13631|title=Heritage advocate targets Robson Square; Arthur Erickson creation subjected to 'incremental intrusions'|date=June 5, 2009|work=Vancouver Courier|access-date=March 30, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Roy Thomson Hall (Toronto, ON) ===\n[[File:RoyThompsonHall.jpg|thumb|[[Roy Thomson Hall]], Toronto, Canada (1982)|222x222px]]Designed and built in the city of Toronto, Roy Thomson Hall was not designed to blend into its surroundings in order to be recognized as a landmark and home to the Toronto Symphony Orchestra.

The interior used a colour palette of grey and silver to harmonize with the concrete structure and create a peaceful atmosphere.

Erickson's design for the museum features a 90-foot-tall metal cone erupting from a structure of steel and concrete. The enormous cone acts as a 'chimney' for the museum's amphitheater, where visitors can overlook visiting artists as they create glass art. Large public art displays and concrete plazas overlook the neighbouring waterway, while pools of water interlaced with stairs and switchback ramps to connect each levels. The museum aims to connect the downtown core to the city's waterfront as well, through a 150-foot long bridge named the [[Bridge of Glass|Chihuly Bridge of Glass]].

The son of Oscar Erickson and Myrtle Chatterson, he had an interest and talent for painting from an early age. Like his father, he served in the [[Canadian Intelligence Corps|Canadian Army Intelligence Corps]] during [[World War II]]. It was during this time that he became familiar with the Japanese language, going on to serve in India, Celyon, and Malaysia.<ref name=\":2\" /> This experience fostered his interest in the art and philosophy of these areas.\n\nErickson\u2019s original intent was to enter into a career in the diplomatic service, however this changed after he stumbled upon an article about [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]. Inspired by Wright\u2019s studio and works, Arthur pursued a career in architecture.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.aefoundation.ca/arthur|title=Arthur Erickson Foundation - Arthur|website=www.aefoundation.ca|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> Erickson\u2019s post-secondary studies included an undergraduate degree at the [[University of British Columbia]], followed by the [[McGill School of Architecture|School of Architecture]] at [[McGill University]]. After graduating from McGill in 1950, Erickson was granted a travel scholarship and traveled in the Mediterranean, Middle East, and Japan. Travelling to these areas allowed him to deepen his exploration of climate and style in their relationship to architecture. Erickson also became a professor, teaching at the [[University of Oregon]] and subsequently the [[University of British Columbia]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.the-peak.ca/2014/06/the-concrete-acropolis/ |title= The Concrete Acropolis |accessdate=June 9, 2014 |last=Hill |first=Max |date=2014-06-09 |publisher=The Peak}}</ref> After teaching, he worked for a few years at [[Thompson Berwick and Pratt and Partners]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Stouck |first=David |date=Sep 6, 2013 |title=Arthur Erickson: An Architect's Life |url= |location= |publisher=Douglas & McIntyre |page= |isbn=978-1771000116 |accessdate= }}</ref> before he went on to design houses in partnership with Geoffrey Massey.

Due to his travels to the Far East, Erickson was fond of integrating light and water into his designs, along with the characteristic horizontal elements and terraces that came from the vernacular architecture of that region.<ref name=\":0\" /> Many buildings, such as the [[Museum of Anthropology at UBC|Museum of Anthropology]] in Vancouver, are inspired by the [[Timber framing|post and beam]] architecture of the Coastal [[First Nations]]. The tectonics of the post-and-beam style can also be found in the construction of Asian temples and the Canadian and American log cabin, further linking his architectural style to his travels during his education. Additionally, Erickson is also known for numerous [[Futurist architecture|futuristic]] designs such as the [[Fresno City Hall]] and the Biological Sciences Building at the [[University of California, Irvine]]. His work balanced the style of modernism with an integration of the surrounding natural environment.\n\n== Significant works ==\n\n=== Simon Fraser University (Burnaby, BC) ===\n[[File:Simon Fraser University.jpg|thumb|[[Simon Fraser University]], [[Burnaby]], B.C.]]\nAs mentioned above, Erickson\u2019s partnership with Geoffrey Massey lead to the winning design submitted for Simon Fraser University. Located on [[Burnaby Mountain]], the unfinished concrete blends in with the surrounding geography in colour but not in shape. When viewed from above in plan, the campus forms a geometric contrast to the snowy mountains of its context. The site and scale of the project is reminiscent of utopian designs from French architects in the late eighteenth century such as [[\u00c9tienne-Louis Boull\u00e9e|Etienne-Louis Bouillee]]<ref name=\":0\" />[[\u00c9tienne-Louis Boull\u00e9e|.]] The design featured an indoor plaza with massive skylights in order to respond sensitively to Vancouver\u2019s rainy, cool climate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Arthur-Erickson|title=Arthur Erickson {{!}} Canadian architect|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> The university provides a balance of the inherent character of British Columbia while still exploring the structural ambitions of the modernist period in the 1960s. Erickson and Massey's project was internationally acclaimed and allowed Arthur\u2019s career to become more distinguished while opening the door to new possibilities.\n\n=== Museum of Anthropology at the University of British Columbia (Vancouver, BC) ===\n[[File:UBC Museum of Anthropology 12.jpg|thumb|[[Museum of Anthropology at UBC]], Vancouver, B.C.]]\nBuilt in 1976, it was created as an inclusion to the campus at the [[University of British Columbia]]. This building blends methods of reinforced concrete and the traditional post-and-beam construction to articulate the structure throughout the project. Oversized beams evoke a monumental feeling in many of Erickson's projects, calling on the size and scale of the trees found in the surrounding context. This project is designed to display the aboriginal art of the province, and is well known for Erickson\u2019s use of concrete piers and large stretches of glass. By using concrete beams to represent dematerialized logs and opening up the main atrium through expanses of glass, Erickson contrasts the traditional notion of post-and-beam construction to integrate these characteristics into a modernistic building.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Robson Square (Vancouver, BC) ===\n[[File:Robson Square waterfall 2018.jpg|thumb|221x221px|[[Robson Square]], Vancouver, B.C.]]\nBuilt in Vancouver in 1979 as a large civic center, Erickson\u2019s design included waterfalls, a roof garden, several plazas, and stairs with ramps integrated within. This complex is one of the few in North America that integrates everything from public space and landscape to the surrounding buildings, from the art gallery to courts of law. As time goes on, more additions are being created that seem to contrast the original intent of the design. Glass barriers were installed near the waterfall, preventing people from getting close to it, as well as on the edges of planters to prevent people from being able to sit on them. It has also since lost the outdoor restaurants, cinema, and large auditorium that once existed on the site.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Smedmen|first=Lisa|url=https://search-proquest-com.lib.ryerson.ca/docview/359530336?accountid=13631|title=Heritage advocate targets Robson Square; Arthur Erickson creation subjected to 'incremental intrusions'|date=June 5, 2009|work=Vancouver Courier|access-date=March 30, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Roy Thomson Hall (Toronto, ON) ===\n[[File:RoyThompsonHall.jpg|thumb|[[Roy Thomson Hall]], Toronto, Canada (1982)|222x222px]]Designed and built in the city of Toronto, Roy Thomson Hall was not designed to blend into its surroundings in order to be recognized as a landmark and home to the Toronto Symphony Orchestra.

Erickson's design for the museum features a 90-foot-tall metal cone erupting from a structure of steel and concrete. The enormous cone acts as a 'chimney' for the museum's amphitheater, where visitors can overlook visiting artists as they create glass art. Large public art displays and concrete plazas overlook the neighbouring waterway, while pools of water interlaced with stairs and switchback ramps to connect each levels. The museum aims to connect the downtown core to the city's waterfront as well, through a 150-foot long bridge named the [[Bridge of Glass|Chihuly Bridge of Glass]]. The bridge is named after Tacoma native [[Dale Chihuly]], who was a pioneer of the [[Studio glass|Studio Glass Movement]] and has many works on display at the museum.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bailey|first=Mike|date=July 2, 2002|title=HOUSE OF GLASS ; TACOMA MUSEUM AND BRIDGE WILL MAKE CITY'S ONCE-GRIM WATERFRONT A SHOWPLACE OF NATIONAL PROMINENCE.|url=http://lib.ryerson.ca/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.lib.ryerson.ca/docview/253146721?accountid=13631|journal=Columbian|volume=|pages=|via=ProQuest}}</ref>\n\n===List of completed works===\n[[File:One Cal Plaza.jpg|thumb|[[One California Plaza]], Los Angeles, CA(1985)|292x292px]]\n[[File:Fresno City Hall.JPG|thumb|[[Fresno City Hall]], Fresno, CA (1991)|225x225px]]\n<!-- The dates on Erickson's websites are the years he designed them - these dates are the years they were *completed*, where applicable -->\n\n* 1955: Killam-Massey House, [[West Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arthurerickson.com/wood-houses/killam-massey-house/7/|title=Killam-Massey House|work=Project description|publisher=Arthur Erickson}}</ref>\n* 1958: Filberg Residence, [[Comox, British Columbia|Comox]], [[British Columbia]], Canada\n* 1960: Dyde House, [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], Canada\n* 1963: Graham House, [[West Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]\n* 1965: [[MacMillan Bloedel#The MacBlo Building|MacMillan Bloedel Building]], [[Vancouver]], British Columbia\n* 1965: Smith Residence, [[West Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]\n* 1965 onward in stages: [[Simon Fraser University]], [[Burnaby]], British Columbia<ref name=\"Pound 2005\">{{cite book |title='Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates'  |last=Pound |first=Richard W. |publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside |year=2005}}</ref>\n* 1967 Catton House (with Geoffrey Massey)\n* 1968: Hi-View Estates [[Port Moody]], [[British Columbia]]\n* 1970: Government of Canada pavilion, [[Expo '70]], [[Osaka]], won top architectural award Aug 17, 1970.<ref name=\"Pound 2005\"/>\n* 1970: Ross Street Sikh Temple, [[Khalsa Diwan Society Vancouver|Khalsa Diwan Society, Vancouver]] \n* 1971: University Hall, [[University of Lethbridge]], [[Lethbridge]], [[Alberta]]\n* 1973: Champlain Heights Elementary School, Vancouver, British Columbia<ref>[http://vancouverschools125.org/killarney/champlain-heights/ Champlain Heights] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209061045/http://vancouverschools125.org/killarney/champlain-heights/ |date=2013-12-09 }}. vancouverschools125.

Based on the [[A Watcher in the Woods|1976 novel]] by [[Florence Engel Randall]], the film tells the story of a teenage girl and her little sister who become encompassed in a supernatural mystery regarding a missing girl in the woods surrounding their new home in the English countryside.\n\nFilmed at [[Pinewood Studios]] and the surrounding areas in [[Buckinghamshire]], England, ''The Watcher in the Woods'' was one of several live-action films produced by [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney Productions]] in the 1980s, when the studio was targeting [[young adult fiction|young adult]] audiences. The film had its premiere at the [[Ziegfeld Theatre (1969)|Ziegfeld Theatre]] in New York City in April 1980, but was pulled from release after ten days, and future screenings were canceled by the studio due to an overwhelming negative response from critics and audiences. Several changes were made thereafter, including the excision of a pre-credits sequence, as well the filming of an entirely new ending, which was directed by [[Vincent McEveety]] without Hough's involvement. Disney re-released the revised cut of the film on October 9, 1981, and it grossed $5 million.\n\nThough critical response to the film was varied and included numerous unfavorable reviews, the film went on to garner a [[cult following]] in the years following its release.<ref name=bfi/> A [[The Watcher in the Woods (2017 film)|television remake of the same name]] starring [[Anjelica Huston]] was released in 2017.\n\n==Plot==\nAmericans Helen and Paul Curtis and their daughters Jan and Ellie, move into a manor in rural [[England]]. Mrs. Aylwood, the owner of the residence who now lives in the guest house next door, notices that Jan bears a striking resemblance to her daughter, Karen, who disappeared inside an abandoned chapel in the woods thirty years earlier.\n\nJan senses something unusual about the property almost immediately, and begins to see strange blue lights in the woods, triangles, and glowing objects. Eventually, Ellie goes to buy a puppy she inexplicably names \"Nerak\". After seeing the reflection of the name \"Nerak\" (Karen spelled backwards), Jan is told about the mystery of Mrs. Aylwood's missing daughter by Mike Fleming, the teenage son of a local woman, Mary.\n\nOne afternoon, Nerak runs into woods, and Ellie chases after him. Jan, realizing her sister has disappeared from the yard, goes into the woods to find her, eventually locating her at a pond. In the water, she sees a blue circle of light, and is blinded by a flash, causing her to fall in; she nearly drowns, but Mrs. Aylwood saves her. Mrs. Aylwood brings Jan and Ellie to her home, and recounts the night her daughter disappeared.\n\nLater, Mike discovers that his mother, Mary, was with Karen when she disappeared, but she evades his questions. Meanwhile, Jan attempts to get information from John Keller, a reclusive aristocrat who was also there that night, but he refuses to speak to her. On her way home, Jan cuts through the woods, where she encounters a local [[hermit]], Tom Colley, who tells Jan he was also present at Karen's disappearance. He claims that during a [[seance]]-like ceremony on the night of a [[lunar eclipse]], Karen vanished when lightning struck the church bell tower.\n\nJan decides to recreate the ceremony during the upcoming [[solar eclipse]], hoping it will bring Karen back. She gathers Mary, Tom, and John at the abandoned chapel, and they attempt to repeat the ceremony. Meanwhile, Ellie, while watching the eclipse from the front yard, suddenly goes into a [[trance]]-like state, apparently possessed, and enters the woods. At the chapel, the ceremony is interrupted by a powerful wind that shatters the windows, and Ellie appears. In a voice that is not her own, she explains that an accidental switch took place thirty years ago, in which Karen traded places with an alien presence from an alternate dimension; thus, the Watcher has been haunting the woods since, while Karen has remained suspended in time.\n\nThe Watcher then leaves Ellie's body, manifesting as a pillar of light, fueled by the \"circle of friendship\". It engulfs Jan and lifts her into the air, but Mike intercedes and pulls her away before the Watcher disappears. Simultaneously, the eclipse ends, and Karen, still the same age as when she disappeared, reappears &ndash; still blindfolded. She removes the blindfold just as Mrs. Aylwood enters the chapel.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n*[[Bette Davis]] as Mrs. Aylwood\n*[[Carroll Baker]] as Helen Curtis\n*[[David McCallum]] as Paul Curtis\n*[[Lynn-Holly Johnson]] as Jan Curtis\n*[[Kyle Richards]] as Ellie Curtis\n*[[Ian Bannen]] as John Keller\n*[[Richard Pasco]] as Tom Colley\n*[[Frances Cuka]] as Mary Fleming\n*[[Benedict Taylor]] as Mike Fleming\n*[[Eleanor Summerfield]] as Mrs. Thayer\n*[[Georgina Hale]] as Young Mrs. Aylwood\n*[[Katharine Levy]] as Karen Aylwood\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n''The Watcher in the Woods'' is based on Florence Engel Randall's 1976 novel ''[[A Watcher in the Woods]]''.

Based on the [[A Watcher in the Woods|1976 novel]] by [[Florence Engel Randall]], the film tells the story of a teenage girl and her little sister who become encompassed in a supernatural mystery regarding a missing girl in the woods surrounding their new home in the English countryside.\n\nFilmed at [[Pinewood Studios]] and the surrounding areas in [[Buckinghamshire]], England, ''The Watcher in the Woods'' was one of several live-action films produced by [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney Productions]] in the 1980s, when the studio was targeting [[young adult fiction|young adult]] audiences. The film had its premiere at the [[Ziegfeld Theatre (1969)|Ziegfeld Theatre]] in New York City in April 1980, but was pulled from release after ten days, and future screenings were canceled by the studio due to an overwhelming negative response from critics and audiences. Several changes were made thereafter, including the excision of a pre-credits sequence, as well the filming of an entirely new ending, which was directed by [[Vincent McEveety]] without Hough's involvement. Disney re-released the revised cut of the film on October 9, 1981, and it grossed $5 million.\n\nThough critical response to the film was varied and included numerous unfavorable reviews, the film went on to garner a [[cult following]] in the years following its release.<ref name=bfi/> A [[The Watcher in the Woods (2017 film)|television remake of the same name]] starring [[Anjelica Huston]] was released in 2017.\n\n==Plot==\nAmericans Helen and Paul Curtis and their daughters Jan and Ellie, move into a manor in rural [[England]]. Mrs. Aylwood, the owner of the residence who now lives in the guest house next door, notices that Jan bears a striking resemblance to her daughter, Karen, who disappeared inside an abandoned chapel in the woods thirty years earlier.\n\nJan senses something unusual about the property almost immediately, and begins to see strange blue lights in the woods, triangles, and glowing objects. Eventually, Ellie goes to buy a puppy she inexplicably names \"Nerak\". After seeing the reflection of the name \"Nerak\" (Karen spelled backwards), Jan is told about the mystery of Mrs. Aylwood's missing daughter by Mike Fleming, the teenage son of a local woman, Mary.\n\nOne afternoon, Nerak runs into woods, and Ellie chases after him. Jan, realizing her sister has disappeared from the yard, goes into the woods to find her, eventually locating her at a pond. In the water, she sees a blue circle of light, and is blinded by a flash, causing her to fall in; she nearly drowns, but Mrs. Aylwood saves her. Mrs. Aylwood brings Jan and Ellie to her home, and recounts the night her daughter disappeared.\n\nLater, Mike discovers that his mother, Mary, was with Karen when she disappeared, but she evades his questions. Meanwhile, Jan attempts to get information from John Keller, a reclusive aristocrat who was also there that night, but he refuses to speak to her. On her way home, Jan cuts through the woods, where she encounters a local [[hermit]], Tom Colley, who tells Jan he was also present at Karen's disappearance. He claims that during a [[seance]]-like ceremony on the night of a [[lunar eclipse]], Karen vanished when lightning struck the church bell tower.\n\nJan decides to recreate the ceremony during the upcoming [[solar eclipse]], hoping it will bring Karen back. She gathers Mary, Tom, and John at the abandoned chapel, and they attempt to repeat the ceremony. Meanwhile, Ellie, while watching the eclipse from the front yard, suddenly goes into a [[trance]]-like state, apparently possessed, and enters the woods. At the chapel, the ceremony is interrupted by a powerful wind that shatters the windows, and Ellie appears. In a voice that is not her own, she explains that an accidental switch took place thirty years ago, in which Karen traded places with an alien presence from an alternate dimension; thus, the Watcher has been haunting the woods since, while Karen has remained suspended in time. \n\nThe Watcher then leaves Ellie's body, manifesting as a pillar of light, fueled by the \"circle of friendship\". It engulfs Jan and lifts her into the air, but Mike intercedes and pulls her away before the Watcher disappears. Simultaneously, the eclipse ends, and Karen, still the same age as when she disappeared, reappears &ndash; still blindfolded. She removes the blindfold just as Mrs. Aylwood enters the chapel.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n*[[Bette Davis]] as Mrs. Aylwood\n*[[Carroll Baker]] as Helen Curtis\n*[[David McCallum]] as Paul Curtis\n*[[Lynn-Holly Johnson]] as Jan Curtis\n*[[Kyle Richards]] as Ellie Curtis\n*[[Ian Bannen]] as John Keller\n*[[Richard Pasco]] as Tom Colley\n*[[Frances Cuka]] as Mary Fleming\n*[[Benedict Taylor]] as Mike Fleming\n*[[Eleanor Summerfield]] as Mrs. Thayer\n*[[Georgina Hale]] as Young Mrs. Aylwood\n*[[Katharine Levy]] as Karen Aylwood\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n''The Watcher in the Woods'' is based on Florence Engel Randall's 1976 novel ''[[A Watcher in the Woods]]''.
