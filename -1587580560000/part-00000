He argued the oppressive structure of the school system could not be reformed.  It must be dismantled in order to free humanity from the crippling effects of the [[institutionalization]] of all of life.\nHe went on to critique modern mass medicine.  In the pre-Internet age, Ilich was highly influential among intellectuals and academics.  He became known worldwide for his progressive polemics about how human culture could preserve and expand, activity expressive of truly human values, in the face of multiple thundering forces of de-humanization.  \n\nIn his several influential books, he argued the benefits of many modern technologies and social arrangements undermine human values and human self-sufficiency, freedom, and dignity.  His in-depth critiques of mass education and modern mass medicine were especially, pointed, relevant; and perhaps, more timely now than during his life.   \n\nHealth, argues Illich, is the capacity to cope with the human reality of death, pain, and sickness. Technology can benefit many; yet, modern mass medicine has gone too far, launching into a godlike battle to eradicate death, pain, and sickness. In doing so, it turns people into risk-averse consuming objects, turning healing into mere science, turning medical healers into mere drug-surgical technicians. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ivan-Illich|title=Ivan Illich - Austrian philosopher and priest}}</ref><ref>{{in lang|it}} [http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/ivan-illich Enciclopedia Treccani]</ref><ref>{{in lang|ca}} [https://www.enciclopedia.cat/EC-GEC-0033489.xml Gran Encyclopedia Catalana]</ref> The book that brought Ivan Illich to public attention was \n\n== Life and career ==\nIllich was born in Vienna to a [[Croatia]]n Catholic father, engineer Ivan Peter Illich, and a [[Sephardic Jewish]] mother, Ellen n\u00e9e Regenstreif-Ortlieb.<ref>{{harvnb|Hansom|2001}}</ref> His maternal grandmother was from [[Texas]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1415202/Ivan-Illich.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Ivan Illich | date=December 5, 2002}}</ref> Illich spoke Italian, Spanish, French, and German fluently.<ref name=Diplo>{{Cite journal|last=Paquot |first=Thierry |url=http://mondediplo.com/2003/01/15illich |title=The Non-Conformist |journal=[[Le Monde diplomatique]] |date=January 2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2003/01/PAQUOT/9866|title=La r\u00e9sistance selon Ivan Illich|date=1 January 2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europeansocialecologyinstitute.org/site/news/obit/illich.html|title=BLUE: OBITUARY - Ivan Illich|first=Tim|last=Barton}}</ref> He later learned [[Croatian language|Croatian]], the language of his grandfathers, then Ancient Greek and Latin, in addition to Portuguese, Hindi, English, and other languages.<ref name=Diplo/> Illich and his family moved to Italy during World War II to escape Nazi persecution.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The prophet of Cuernavaca: Ivan Illich and the crisis of the west|last=Hartch|first=Todd|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2015|isbn=978-0190204563|location=|pages=|url-status=live}}</ref> He finished high school in Florence, and then went on to study [[histology]] and [[crystallography]] at the local [[University of Florence]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Hoping to return to Austria following World War II, Illich enrolled in a doctorate in medieval history at the [[University of Salzburg]]<ref name=\"Diplo\" /> with the hope of gaining legal residency as he was undocumented.<ref name=\":0\" /> He wrote a dissertation focusing on the historian [[Arnold J.

He was ordained in 1951.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFollowing his ordination, in 1951, he \"signed up to become a parish priest in one of New York's poorest neighborhoods\u2014[[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]], on the northern tip of Manhattan, at that time a barrio of newly-arrived [[Puerto Ricans in the United States|Puerto Rican immigrants]].\"<ref name=Madar>{{cite magazine |last1=Madar |first1=Chase |title=The People's Priest |url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-peoples-priest/ |magazine=The American Conservative |date=1 February 2010 |language=en-us}}</ref> In 1956, at the age of 30, he was appointed vice rector of the [[Catholic University of Puerto Rico]], \"a position he managed to keep for several years before getting thrown out\u2014Illich was just a little too loud in his criticism of the Vatican's pronouncements on [[birth control]] and comparatively demure silence about [[Nuclear weapon|the nuclear bomb]].\"<ref name=Madar/> It was in [[Puerto Rico]] that Illich met [[Everett Reimer]] and the two began to analyze their own functions as \"educational\" leaders. In 1959, he traveled throughout South America on foot and by bus.<ref name=Diplo/>\n\nThe end of Illich's tenure at the university came in 1960 as the result of a controversy involving bishops [[James Edward McManus]] and [[James Peter Davis]], who had denounced [[Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn|Governor Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn]] and his [[Popular_Democratic_Party_(Puerto_Rico)|Popular Democratic Party]] for their positions in favor of birth control and divorce.

As a politician, I predicted that there wasn't enough strength in Catholic ranks to create a meaningful platform and that failure of McManus's party would be disastrous on the already frail prestige of the Puerto Rican Church. As a theologian, I believe that the Church must always condemn injustice in the light of the Gospel, but never has the right to speak in favor of a specific political party.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gray|first1=Francine du Plessix|title=Divine Disobedience: Profiles in Catholic Radicalism|url=https://archive.org/details/divinedisobedien00gray|url-access=registration|date=1970|publisher=Knopf|location=New York}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter Illich disobeyed a direct order from McManus forbidding all priests from dining with Governor Mu\u00f1oz, the bishop ordered Illich to leave his post at the university, referring to his very presence as \"dangerous to the Diocese of Ponce and its institutions.\"<ref name=Hartch/>\n\nDespite this display of insubordination and an order from [[Paul Tanner|Paul Francis Tanner]], then general secretary of the [[National Catholic Welfare Conference]], forbidding Illich from any official role in the organization's Latin American bureau, Illich maintained the support of the influential priest John J. Considine, who continued to push for Illich to have a role in training the Church's missionaries, personally funding trips to Mexico in order for Illich to scout locations.<ref name=Hartch/>\n\nFollowing his departure from Puerto Rico, Illich moved to [[Cuernavaca]], Mexico, where he founded the Center of Intercultural Formation (CIF) in 1961, originally as missionary training center.<ref name=\":0\" /> As the center became more influential it became the [[Centro Intercultural de Documentaci\u00f3n]] (CIDOC, or Intercultural Documentation Center),<ref name=\":0\" /> ostensibly a research center offering language courses to missionaries from North America and volunteers of the [[Alliance for Progress]] program<ref name=Diplo/> initiated by [[John F. Kennedy]]. His real intent was to document the participation of the Vatican in the \"modern development\" of the so-called [[Third World]]. Illich looked askance at the liberal pity or conservative imperiousness that motivated the rising tide of global industrial development. He viewed such emissaries as a form of industrial hegemony and, as such, an act of \"war on subsistence\". He sought to teach missionaries dispatched by the Church not to impose their own cultural values.<ref>{{harvnb|du Plessix Gray|1970|pp=44 & 49}}</ref> \"Throughout the late '60s and early '70s, CIDOC was part language school and part free university for intellectuals from all over the Americas.\"<ref name=Madar/> At the CIDOC, \"Illich was able to develop his potent and highly influential critique of Third World development schemes and their fresh-faced agents: Kennedy's Alliance for Progress, the [[Peace Corps]], and countless other missionary efforts bankrolled and organized by wealthy nations, foundations, and religious groups.\"<ref name=\"Madar\" />\n\nAfter ten years, critical analysis from the CIDOC of the institutional actions by the Church brought the organization into conflict with the Vatican. Unpopular with the local chapter of [[Opus Dei]],<ref name=Madar/> Illich was called to Rome for questioning, due in part to a [[CIA]] report.<ref name=Diplo/><ref name=\":0\" /> While he was not convicted or punished by the Vatican, it was then that he decided to renounce active priesthood.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 1976, Illich, apparently concerned by the influx of formal academics and the potential side effects of its own \"institutionalization\", shut the center down with consent from the other members of the CIDOC. Several of the members subsequently continued language schools in Cuernavaca, some of which still exist. Illich himself resigned from the active priesthood in the late-1960s (having attained the rank of [[monsignor]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}), but continued to identify as a priest and occasionally performed private [[Mass (liturgy)|masses]].\n\nIn the 1970s, Illich was popular among leftist intellectuals in France, his thesis having been discussed in particular by [[Andr\u00e9 Gorz]]. However, his influence declined after the [[1981 French presidential election|1981 election]] of [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] as Illich was considered too pessimistic at a time when the [[French Left]] took control of the government.<ref name=Diplo/>\n\nIn the 1980s and beyond, Illich traveled extensively, mainly splitting his time between the United States, Mexico, and Germany. He held an appointment as a Visiting Professor of Philosophy, Science, Technology and Society at [[Penn State]]. He also taught at the [[University of Bremen]] and [[University of Hagen]].<ref>Illich, Ivan (1999).

Goodman is credited in ''[[Deschooling Society]]'' with having \"radically obliged\" Illich to revise his thinking, and described with great affection in Illich's 1990s interviews with [[David Cayley]]:\n\n{{quote|...

He had recently played a major part in getting a law passed which recognized that the state should not interfere with the private activities of consenting adults.\n\nWell, I was shocked!

Giving examples of what he regards as the ineffectual nature of institutionalized education, Illich posited self-directed education, supported by intentional social relations, in fluid informal arrangements:\n\n{{quote|Universal education through schooling is not feasible. It would be no more feasible if it were attempted by means of alternative institutions built on the style of present schools. Neither new attitudes of teachers toward their pupils nor the proliferation of educational hardware or software (in classroom or bedroom), nor finally the attempt to expand the pedagogue's responsibility until it engulfs his pupils' lifetimes will deliver universal education. The current search for new educational ''funnels'' must be reversed into the search for their institutional inverse: educational ''webs'' which heighten the opportunity for each one to transform each moment of his living into one of learning, sharing, and caring. We hope to contribute concepts needed by those who conduct such counterfoil research on education--and also to those who seek alternatives to other established service industries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecotopia.com/webpress/deschooling.htm|title=Deschooling Society, by Ivan Illich}}</ref>}}\n\nThe last sentence makes clear what the title suggests\u2014that the institutionalization of education tends towards the institutionalization of society and that ideas for de-institutionalizing education may be a starting point for a de-institutionalized society.\n\nThe book is more than a critique\u2014it contains suggestions for a reinvention of learning throughout society and lifetime. Particularly striking is his call (in 1971) for the use of advanced technology to support \"learning webs\":\n\n{{quote|The operation of a peer-matching network would be simple. The user would identify himself by name and address and describe the activity for which he sought a peer.

(1973): 'We can disestablish schools, or we can deschool culture'.<ref>{{cite book|last=Illich|first=Ivan|title=After deschooling, what?|year=1976|publisher=Writers and Readers Pub.

In this new work Illich generalized the themes that he had previously applied to the field of education: the institutionalization of specialized knowledge, the dominant role of [[technocratic]] elites in industrial society, and the need to develop new instruments for the reconquest of practical knowledge by the average citizen. He wrote that \"[e]lite professional groups ... have come to exert a 'radical [[monopoly]]' on such basic human activities as health, agriculture, home-building, and learning, leading to a 'war on subsistence' that robs peasant societies of their vital skills and know-how. The result of much economic development is very often not human flourishing but 'modernized poverty', dependency, and an out-of-control system in which the humans become worn-down mechanical parts.\"<ref name=Madar/> Illich proposed that we should \"invert the present deep structure of tools\" in order to \"give people tools that guarantee their right to work with independent efficiency.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Illich|1973}}</ref>\n\n''Tools for Conviviality'' attracted worldwide attention.

He argued that the [[medicalization]] in recent decades of so many of life's vicissitudes\u2014birth and death, for example\u2014frequently caused more harm than good and rendered many people in effect lifelong patients. He marshalled a body of statistics to show what he considered the shocking extent of post-operative side-effects and drug-induced illness in advanced industrial society. He introduced to a wider public the notion of [[iatrogenesis|iatrogenic disease]],<ref>{{harvnb|Illich|1974b}}</ref> which had been scientifically established a century earlier by British nurse [[Florence Nightingale]] (1820\u20131910).

He was ordained in 1951.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFollowing his ordination, in 1951, he \"signed up to become a parish priest in one of New York's poorest neighborhoods\u2014[[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]], on the northern tip of Manhattan, at that time a barrio of newly-arrived [[Puerto Ricans in the United States|Puerto Rican immigrants]].\"<ref name=Madar>{{cite magazine |last1=Madar |first1=Chase |title=The People's Priest |url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-peoples-priest/ |magazine=The American Conservative |date=1 February 2010 |language=en-us}}</ref> In 1956, at the age of 30, he was appointed vice rector of the [[Catholic University of Puerto Rico]], \"a position he managed to keep for several years before getting thrown out\u2014Illich was just a little too loud in his criticism of the Vatican's pronouncements on [[birth control]] and comparatively demure silence about [[Nuclear weapon|the nuclear bomb]].\"<ref name=Madar/> It was in [[Puerto Rico]] that Illich met [[Everett Reimer]] and the two began to analyze their own functions as \"educational\" leaders. In 1959, he traveled throughout South America on foot and by bus.<ref name=Diplo/>\n\nThe end of Illich's tenure at the university came in 1960 as the result of a controversy involving bishops [[James Edward McManus]] and [[James Peter Davis]], who had denounced [[Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn|Governor Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn]] and his [[Popular_Democratic_Party_(Puerto_Rico)|Popular Democratic Party]] for their positions in favor of birth control and divorce.

As a politician, I predicted that there wasn't enough strength in Catholic ranks to create a meaningful platform and that failure of McManus's party would be disastrous on the already frail prestige of the Puerto Rican Church. As a theologian, I believe that the Church must always condemn injustice in the light of the Gospel, but never has the right to speak in favor of a specific political party.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gray|first1=Francine du Plessix|title=Divine Disobedience: Profiles in Catholic Radicalism|url=https://archive.org/details/divinedisobedien00gray|url-access=registration|date=1970|publisher=Knopf|location=New York}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter Illich disobeyed a direct order from McManus forbidding all priests from dining with Governor Mu\u00f1oz, the bishop ordered Illich to leave his post at the university, referring to his very presence as \"dangerous to the Diocese of Ponce and its institutions.\"<ref name=Hartch/>\n\nDespite this display of insubordination and an order from [[Paul Tanner|Paul Francis Tanner]], then general secretary of the [[National Catholic Welfare Conference]], forbidding Illich from any official role in the organization's Latin American bureau, Illich maintained the support of the influential priest John J. Considine, who continued to push for Illich to have a role in training the Church's missionaries, personally funding trips to Mexico in order for Illich to scout locations.<ref name=Hartch/>\n\nFollowing his departure from Puerto Rico, Illich moved to [[Cuernavaca]], Mexico, where he founded the Center of Intercultural Formation (CIF) in 1961, originally as missionary training center.<ref name=\":0\" /> As the center became more influential it became the [[Centro Intercultural de Documentaci\u00f3n]] (CIDOC, or Intercultural Documentation Center),<ref name=\":0\" /> ostensibly a research center offering language courses to missionaries from North America and volunteers of the [[Alliance for Progress]] program<ref name=Diplo/> initiated by [[John F. Kennedy]]. His real intent was to document the participation of the Vatican in the \"modern development\" of the so-called [[Third World]]. Illich looked askance at the liberal pity or conservative imperiousness that motivated the rising tide of global industrial development. He viewed such emissaries as a form of industrial hegemony and, as such, an act of \"war on subsistence\". He sought to teach missionaries dispatched by the Church not to impose their own cultural values.<ref>{{harvnb|du Plessix Gray|1970|pp=44 & 49}}</ref> \"Throughout the late '60s and early '70s, CIDOC was part language school and part free university for intellectuals from all over the Americas.\"<ref name=Madar/> At the CIDOC, \"Illich was able to develop his potent and highly influential critique of Third World development schemes and their fresh-faced agents: Kennedy's Alliance for Progress, the [[Peace Corps]], and countless other missionary efforts bankrolled and organized by wealthy nations, foundations, and religious groups.\"<ref name=\"Madar\" />\n\nAfter ten years, critical analysis from the CIDOC of the institutional actions by the Church brought the organization into conflict with the Vatican. Unpopular with the local chapter of [[Opus Dei]],<ref name=Madar/> Illich was called to Rome for questioning, due in part to a [[CIA]] report.<ref name=Diplo/><ref name=\":0\" /> While he was not convicted or punished by the Vatican, it was then that he decided to renounce active priesthood.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 1976, Illich, apparently concerned by the influx of formal academics and the potential side effects of its own \"institutionalization\", shut the center down with consent from the other members of the CIDOC. Several of the members subsequently continued language schools in Cuernavaca, some of which still exist. Illich himself resigned from the active priesthood in the late-1960s (having attained the rank of [[monsignor]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}), but continued to identify as a priest and occasionally performed private [[Mass (liturgy)|masses]].\n\nIn the 1970s, Illich was popular among leftist intellectuals in France, his thesis having been discussed in particular by [[Andr\u00e9 Gorz]]. However, his influence declined after the [[1981 French presidential election|1981 election]] of [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] as Illich was considered too pessimistic at a time when the [[French Left]] took control of the government.<ref name=Diplo/>\n\nIn the 1980s and beyond, Illich traveled extensively, mainly splitting his time between the United States, Mexico, and Germany. He held an appointment as a Visiting Professor of Philosophy, Science, Technology and Society at [[Penn State]]. He also taught at the [[University of Bremen]] and [[University of Hagen]].<ref>Illich, Ivan (1999).

Goodman is credited in ''[[Deschooling Society]]'' with having \"radically obliged\" Illich to revise his thinking, and described with great affection in Illich's 1990s interviews with [[David Cayley]]:\n\n{{quote|...

He had recently played a major part in getting a law passed which recognized that the state should not interfere with the private activities of consenting adults.\n\nWell, I was shocked! I would not have suspected that within three of four years we would be good friends and that during the last part of his life he would spend considerable time with me in Cuernavaca.

Giving examples of what he regards as the ineffectual nature of institutionalized education, Illich posited self-directed education, supported by intentional social relations, in fluid informal arrangements:\n\n{{quote|Universal education through schooling is not feasible. It would be no more feasible if it were attempted by means of alternative institutions built on the style of present schools. Neither new attitudes of teachers toward their pupils nor the proliferation of educational hardware or software (in classroom or bedroom), nor finally the attempt to expand the pedagogue's responsibility until it engulfs his pupils' lifetimes will deliver universal education. The current search for new educational ''funnels'' must be reversed into the search for their institutional inverse: educational ''webs'' which heighten the opportunity for each one to transform each moment of his living into one of learning, sharing, and caring. We hope to contribute concepts needed by those who conduct such counterfoil research on education--and also to those who seek alternatives to other established service industries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecotopia.com/webpress/deschooling.htm|title=Deschooling Society, by Ivan Illich}}</ref>}}\n\nThe last sentence makes clear what the title suggests\u2014that the institutionalization of education tends towards the institutionalization of society and that ideas for de-institutionalizing education may be a starting point for a de-institutionalized society.\n\nThe book is more than a critique\u2014it contains suggestions for a reinvention of learning throughout society and lifetime. Particularly striking is his call (in 1971) for the use of advanced technology to support \"learning webs\":\n\n{{quote|The operation of a peer-matching network would be simple. The user would identify himself by name and address and describe the activity for which he sought a peer.

As he later asserted in ''After Deschooling, What?'' (1973): 'We can disestablish schools, or we can deschool culture'.<ref>{{cite book|last=Illich|first=Ivan|title=After deschooling, what?|year=1976|publisher=Writers and Readers Pub.

In this new work Illich generalized the themes that he had previously applied to the field of education: the institutionalization of specialized knowledge, the dominant role of [[technocratic]] elites in industrial society, and the need to develop new instruments for the reconquest of practical knowledge by the average citizen. He wrote that \"[e]lite professional groups ... have come to exert a 'radical [[monopoly]]' on such basic human activities as health, agriculture, home-building, and learning, leading to a 'war on subsistence' that robs peasant societies of their vital skills and know-how. The result of much economic development is very often not human flourishing but 'modernized poverty', dependency, and an out-of-control system in which the humans become worn-down mechanical parts.\"<ref name=Madar/> Illich proposed that we should \"invert the present deep structure of tools\" in order to \"give people tools that guarantee their right to work with independent efficiency.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Illich|1973}}</ref>\n\n''Tools for Conviviality'' attracted worldwide attention.

He argued that the [[medicalization]] in recent decades of so many of life's vicissitudes\u2014birth and death, for example\u2014frequently caused more harm than good and rendered many people in effect lifelong patients. He marshalled a body of statistics to show what he considered the shocking extent of post-operative side-effects and drug-induced illness in advanced industrial society. He introduced to a wider public the notion of [[iatrogenesis|iatrogenic disease]],<ref>{{harvnb|Illich|1974b}}</ref> which had been scientifically established a century earlier by British nurse [[Florence Nightingale]] (1820\u20131910).

The half-dozen largest candidates have at least one known moon, allowing determination of their masses. The interest of dwarf planets to [[planetary geology|planetary geologists]] is that, being differentiated and perhaps geologically active bodies, they are likely to display planetary geology, an expectation born out by the 2015 ''[[New Horizons]]'' mission to Pluto and ''[[Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn]]'' mission to Ceres.\n\nThe term ''dwarf planet'' was coined by planetary scientist [[Alan Stern]] as part of a three-way categorization of planetary-mass objects in the Solar System: classical planets (the big eight), dwarf planets and [[satellite planet]]s. Dwarf planets were thus originally conceived of as a kind of planet, as the name suggests. However, in 2006 the term was adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) as a category of ''sub''-planetary objects, part of a [[IAU definition of planet|three-way recategorization]] of bodies orbiting the Sun<ref name=\"finalresolution\"/> precipitated by the discovery of [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], an [[trans-Neptunian object|object farther away from the Sun than Neptune]] that was more massive than Pluto but still much smaller than the classical planets, after discoveries of a number of other objects that rivaled Pluto in size had forced a reconsideration of what Pluto was.<ref name=\"Brown Schaller 2007\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1139415 |last1=Brown |first1=Michael E. |authorlink=Michael E.

Bodies smaller than a few kilometers are dominated by non-gravitational forces and tend to have an irregular shape and may be rubble piles.

At this point a body is as round as it is possible to be, given its rotation and tidal effects, and is an [[ellipsoid]] in shape.

If such a rotating body were to be heated until it melted, its overall shape would not change when liquid. The extreme example of a body that may be scalene due to rapid rotation is {{dp|Haumea}}, which is twice as long along its major axis as it is at the poles. If the body has a massive nearby companion, then tidal forces cause its rotation to gradually slow until it is tidally locked, such that it always presents the same face to its companion. An extreme example of this is the Pluto\u2013Charon system, where both bodies are tidally locked to each other. Tidally locked bodies are also scalene, though sometimes only slightly so. Earth's [[Moon]] is also tidally locked, as are all rounded satellites of the gas giants.\n\nThe upper and lower size and mass limits of dwarf planets have not been specified by the IAU. There is no defined upper limit, and an object larger or more massive than [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] that has not \"cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit\" would be classified as a dwarf planet.<ref>Indeed, Mike Brown has set out to find such an object.

The three objects under consideration during the debates leading up to the 2006 IAU acceptance of the category of dwarf planet \u2013 Ceres, Pluto and Eris \u2013 are universally accepted as dwarf planets, including by those astronomers who continue to classify dwarf planets as planets. In 2015, Ceres and Pluto were determined to have shapes consistent with hydrostatic equilibrium (and thus with being dwarf planets) by the ''Dawn'' and ''New Horizons'' missions, respectively. Eris is assumed to be a dwarf planet because it is more massive than Pluto.\n\nIn order of discovery, these three bodies are:\n\n# {{dp|Ceres}} [[File:Ceres symbol.svg|15px]] \u2013 discovered January 1, 1801 and announced January 24, 45&nbsp;years before [[Neptune]].

Bodies smaller than a few kilometers are dominated by non-gravitational forces and tend to have an irregular shape and may be rubble piles. Larger objects, where gravitation is significant but not dominant, are \"potato\" shaped; the more massive the body is, the higher its internal pressure, the more solid it is and the more rounded its shape, until the pressure is sufficient to overcome its internal [[compressive strength]] and it achieves [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]. At this point a body is as round as it is possible to be, given its rotation and tidal effects, and is an [[ellipsoid]] in shape. This is the defining limit of a dwarf planet.<ref>Lineweaver & Marc Norman, 2010, \"The Potato Radius: a Lower Minimum Size for Dwarf Planets\"</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| width     = 350\n| direction = vertical\n| image1    = Masses of the dwarf planets.png\n| caption1  = Comparative masses of the likeliest dwarf planets, per Grundy et al., plus [[Charon (moon)|Charon]] for comparison.

If the body does not rotate, it will be a sphere, but the faster it rotates, the more [[Oblate spheroid|oblate]] or even [[scalene ellipsoid|scalene]] it becomes. If such a rotating body were to be heated until it melted, its overall shape would not change when liquid. The extreme example of a body that may be scalene due to rapid rotation is {{dp|Haumea}}, which is twice as long along its major axis as it is at the poles. If the body has a massive nearby companion, then tidal forces cause its rotation to gradually slow until it is tidally locked, such that it always presents the same face to its companion. An extreme example of this is the Pluto\u2013Charon system, where both bodies are tidally locked to each other. Tidally locked bodies are also scalene, though sometimes only slightly so. Earth's [[Moon]] is also tidally locked, as are all rounded satellites of the gas giants.\n\nThe upper and lower size and mass limits of dwarf planets have not been specified by the IAU. There is no defined upper limit, and an object larger or more massive than [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] that has not \"cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit\" would be classified as a dwarf planet.<ref>Indeed, Mike Brown has set out to find such an object.

Alan Stern calls planetary-mass moons \"[[satellite planet]]s\", one of three categories of planet, together with dwarf planets and classical planets.<ref name=\"News.discovery.com\">\n{{cite web |url=http://news.discovery.com/space/should-large-moons-be-called-satellite-planets.html |title=Should Large Moons Be Called 'Satellite Planets'? |publisher=News.discovery.com |date=May 14, 2010 |accessdate=November 4, 2011}}</ref> The term ''[[planemo]]'' (\"planetary-mass object\") also covers all three populations.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Basri |first1=G. |last2=Brown |first2=M.E. |date=2006 |title=Planetesimals to Brown Dwarfs: What is a Planet? |url=http://siba.unipv.it/fisica/articoli/A/Annual%20Review%20Earth%20Planetary%20Sciences_vol.34_2006_pp.193-216.pdf |journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences |volume=34 |pages=193\u2013216 |doi=10.1146/annurev.earth.34.031405.125058 |arxiv=astro-ph/0608417 |bibcode=2006AREPS..34..193B |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130731133553/http://siba.unipv.it/fisica/articoli/A/Annual%20Review%20Earth%20Planetary%20Sciences_vol.34_2006_pp.193-216.pdf |archivedate=July 31, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n=== Charon ===\nThere has been some debate as to whether the Pluto\u2013[[Charon (moon)|Charon]] system should be considered a [[binary planet|double dwarf planet]]. \nIn a draft resolution for the [[IAU definition of planet]], both Pluto and Charon were considered planets in a binary system.<ref group=note>The footnote in the original text reads: ''For two or more objects comprising a multiple object system.... A secondary object satisfying these conditions i.e. that of mass, shape is also designated a planet if the system barycentre resides outside the primary. Secondary objects not satisfying these criteria are \"satellites\". Under this definition, Pluto's companion Charon is a planet, making Pluto\u2013Charon a double planet.''</ref><ref name=\"Draft Resolution 5\"/> The IAU currently states that Charon is not considered to be a dwarf planet but rather is a satellite of Pluto, although the idea that Charon might qualify as a dwarf planet in its own right may be considered at a later date.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iau.org/public/themes/pluto/ |title=Pluto and the Solar System |publisher=IAU |accessdate=July 10, 2013}}</ref> However, it is no longer clear that Charon is in hydrostatic equilibrium. Further, the location of the [[Center of mass#Barycenter in astrophysics and astronomy|barycenter]] depends not only on the relative masses of the bodies, but also on the distance between them; the barycenter of the Sun\u2013Jupiter orbit, for example, lies outside the Sun, but they are not considered a binary object.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Wikipedia books\n| 1 = Dwarf Planets of the Solar System & Their Satellites\n| 3 = Solar System\n}}\n{{cmn|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Lists of astronomical objects]]\n* [[Centaur (minor planet)|Centaur]]\n* [[List of gravitationally rounded objects of the Solar System]]\n* [[Lists of planets|List of planetary bodies]]\n* [[List of possible dwarf planets]]\n* [[List of former planets]]\n* [[Lists of small Solar System bodies]]\n* [[Mesoplanet]]\n}}\n{{clear}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n{{Commons category|Dwarf planets of the Solar System}}\n* NPR: [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5631291 Dwarf Planets May Finally Get Respect] (David Kestenbaum)\n* BBC News: [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4798205.stm Q&A New planets proposal], August 16, 2006\n* [[Ottawa Citizen]]: [https://web.archive.org/web/20070224221409/http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=a9591aed-f19f-4ac3-a324-1f8bb46d9379&p=2 The case against Pluto] (P.
