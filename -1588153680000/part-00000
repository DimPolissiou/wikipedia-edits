[[Pakistan]] had a total installed power generation capacity of over 34 [[Gigawatt|GW]] by December 2018. However, de-rated capacity is approximately 31 GW during the year. Under [[China Pakistan Economic Corridor]] (CPEC) project, with an investment of $25 Billion, the power plants of 12,334 MW capacity would be completed on a priority basis. Pakistan has witnessed a sharp increase in electricity production of almost 11 GW from 2012 to 2017, bridging a much needed gap between supply and demand.<ref>https://www.dawn.com/news/1455026</ref><ref>https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2018/03/15/demand-and-supply-gap-of-electricity-bridged-na-told/</ref><ref>https://mettisglobal.news/11000-mw-electricity-added-in-national-grid-secretary-planning/</ref>\n\nPakistan has an installed electricity generation capacity of 33,836 MW in 2018.<ref> https://www.dawn.com/news/1454888/circular-debt-rises-to-rs755bn-pac-told</ref> Furnace oil (16 percent), [[hydroelectricity|hydel]] (27 percent), Natural gas (12 percent), LNG (26 percent), Coal (9 percent), Renewable (Solar & Wind 5 percent) and nuclear (5 per cent) are the principal sources. In the next 10 years, peak electricity demand is expected to rise by four to five per cent, which is roughly 1,500 MW. Pakistan has a lopsided energy mix, diminishing indigenous fuel reserves, increasing circular debt and transmission hold-ups. Pakistan has almost exhausted its gas reserves. Imported oil's price hikes affect the budget and its constant supply cannot be guaranteed. Pakistan has the potential to meet these energy challenges through hydroelectric power, but there are political and environmental issues in building dams. Rationality demands reducing reliance on oil and going for alternatives. The development of alternatives does not happen overnight. Pakistan will have to rely on imported fuels for the interim period at a huge cost. LNG is difficult to import, using coal has environmental issues, using shale gas also has environmental issues attached with it, and wind power has transmission network challenges.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/655573/pakistans-energy-security/|title=Pakistan\u2019s energy security - The Express Tribune|date=7 January 2014|website=Tribune.com.pk}}</ref> With total estimated coal reserves of over 186bn tonnes, Pakistan ranks sixth among coal-rich countries and has recently begun to further exploit this greenhouse gas-emitting resource<ref name=\"http://www.dawn.com/news/1172656\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1172656 |title=Lakhra coal for power generation - Newspaper |publisher=Dawn.Com |date=2015-03-30 |accessdate=2018-07-17}}</ref><ref>https://www.dawn.com/news/1470581/thar-coal-plant-begins-pumping-power-into-national-grid</ref>\n\n==Oil==\n\n===In service===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

[[Pakistan]] had a total installed power generation capacity of over 34 [[Gigawatt|GW]] by December 2018. However, de-rated capacity is approximately 31 GW during the year. Under [[China Pakistan Economic Corridor]] (CPEC) project, with an investment of $25 Billion, the power plants of 12,334 MW capacity would be completed on a priority basis. Pakistan has witnessed a sharp increase in electricity production of almost 11 GW from 2012 to 2017, bridging a much needed gap between supply and demand.<ref>https://www.dawn.com/news/1455026</ref><ref>https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2018/03/15/demand-and-supply-gap-of-electricity-bridged-na-told/</ref><ref>https://mettisglobal.news/11000-mw-electricity-added-in-national-grid-secretary-planning/</ref>\n\nPakistan has an installed electricity generation capacity of 33,836 MW in 2018.<ref> https://www.dawn.com/news/1454888/circular-debt-rises-to-rs755bn-pac-told</ref> Furnace oil (16 percent), [[hydroelectricity|hydel]] (27 percent), Natural gas (12 percent), LNG (26 percent), Coal (9 percent), Renewable (Solar & Wind 5 percent) and nuclear (5 per cent) are the principal sources. In the next 10 years, peak electricity demand is expected to rise by four to five per cent, which is roughly 1,500 MW. Pakistan has a lopsided energy mix, diminishing indigenous fuel reserves, increasing circular debt and transmission hold-ups. Pakistan has almost exhausted its gas reserves. Imported oil's price hikes affect the budget and its constant supply cannot be guaranteed. Pakistan has the potential to meet these energy challenges through hydroelectric power, but there are political and environmental issues in building dams. Rationality demands reducing reliance on oil and going for alternatives. The development of alternatives does not happen overnight. Pakistan will have to rely on imported fuels for the interim period at a huge cost. LNG is difficult to import, using coal has environmental issues, using shale gas also has environmental issues attached with it, and wind power has transmission network challenges.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/655573/pakistans-energy-security/|title=Pakistan\u2019s energy security - The Express Tribune|date=7 January 2014|website=Tribune.com.pk}}</ref> With total estimated coal reserves of over 186bn tonnes, Pakistan ranks sixth among coal-rich countries and has recently begun to further exploit this greenhouse gas-emitting resource<ref name=\"http://www.dawn.com/news/1172656\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1172656 |title=Lakhra coal for power generation - Newspaper |publisher=Dawn.Com |date=2015-03-30 |accessdate=2018-07-17}}</ref><ref>https://www.dawn.com/news/1470581/thar-coal-plant-begins-pumping-power-into-national-grid</ref>\n\n==Oil==\n\n===In service===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
