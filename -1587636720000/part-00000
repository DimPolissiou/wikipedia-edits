Verwijs rejected the manuscript, but in 1872 Jan Gerhardus Ottema (1804&ndash;1879), a prominent member of the Frisian Society for History and Culture, published a Dutch translation. Ottema believed it to be written in authentic [[Old Frisian]]. The book was subsequently translated into English by William Sandbach in 1876, and published by Tr\u00fcbner & Co. of London.\n\nWithin the first few years after the appearance of the Oera Linda Book, its recent origin was established not only based on the exceptional claims being made, but also because of a number of anachronisms it contained. The text was nevertheless a source of inspiration for a number of occultists and speculative historians. While there was some debate among Dutch academics and in a number of newspapers about the book's authenticity during the 1870s, by 1879 it was widely recognized as a forgery.\n\n===Nazi Germany===\nMore than forty years later, beginning in 1922, Dutch ''[[v\u00f6lkisch]]'' philologist [[Herman Wirth]] revived the issue. Wirth published a German translation of what he dubbed the \"Nordic Bible\" in 1933, as ''Die Ura Linda Chronik''.\n\nA panel discussion on Wirth's book at the University of Berlin on 4 May 1934 was the immediate impulse for the foundation of ''[[Ahnenerbe]]'' by [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]] and Wirth, together with [[Richard Walther Darr\u00e9]]. Because of the infatuation of Himmler with the Oera Linda Book and its consequent association with Nazi occultism, it became known as \"Himmler's Bible\". Wirth's book was by no means universally acclaimed among the Nazi-era Nordicist academics, and the 1934 panel discussion was steeped in heated controversy. [[Alfred Rosenberg]] and his circle rejected it. [[Gustav Neckel]] had praised Wirth's work before publication, but upon seeing its content published a dismayed recension.<ref>''Der Tag'', Berlin, 31. December 1933.</ref>\n\nSpeaking in defense of the book's authenticity were [[Walther W\u00fcst]] and [[Otto Huth]], besides Wirth himself. Speaking against its authenticity were Neckel, Karl Hermann Jacob-Friesen (who identified it as a satirical hoax by Linden) and [[Arthur H\u00fcbner]]. H\u00fcbner was one of the most respected Germanists of his generation, and his verdict of the Oera Linda being a falsification settled the defeat of Wirth's party. The public defeat of Himmler's scholarly brand of \"esoteric Nordicism\" resulted in the foundation of Ahnenerbe, which attracted occultists such as [[Karl Maria Wiligut]] and was viewed with suspicion by the mainstream National Socialist ideologues of [[Amt Rosenberg]].<ref>Gerd Simon, [http://homepages.uni-tuebingen.de/gerd.simon/himmlerbibel.pdf Himmlers Bibel und die \u00f6ffentlichkeitswirksamste Podiumsdiskussion in der Geschichte der Germanistik]</ref>\n\n===Modern esotericism===\nThe book experienced a revival of popularity in the English-speaking world with the writings of Robert Scrutton.

The text alleges that Europe and other lands were, for a large part of their history, ruled by a succession of folk-mothers presiding over a hierarchical order of celibate priestesses dedicated to the goddess [[Frijjo|Frya]], daughter of the creator god Wr-alda and Jrtha, the earth mother. The claim is also made that this Frisian civilization possessed an alphabet that was the ancestor of the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] and [[Phoenician alphabet]]s. Modern [[historiography]] is essentially ignored, particularly in the area of basic chronology of known events in the recent and distant past of Europe. Geological as well as geographical evidence that was readily available even as far back as Over de Linden's time is also mostly absent from the manuscript.\n\nThe earliest portion of the Oera Linda Book, namely ''Frya\u2019s Tex'', was supposedly composed in 2194 BC, whereas the most recent part, the letter of Hidde Oera Linda, dates to AD 1256. Almost half of the entire book comprises ''The Book of Adela\u2019s Followers'', the original text around which the rest grew. It is purported to have been compiled in the 6th century BC from a mixture of contemporary writings and ancient inscriptions. The last two sections of the Oera Linda Book contain a number of [[lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunae]] and the book itself breaks off in mid-sentence.\n\nIt also describes a lost land called [[Atlantis|Atland]] (the name given to Atlantis by the 17th century scholar [[Olof Rudbeck]]), which was supposedly submerged in 2194 BC, the same year as 19th century Dutch and Frisian almanacs, following traditional Biblical chronology given for [[Deluge (mythology)|Noah's flood]].<ref name=\"Jensma\"/>\n\n===Sections===\n\nThe Oera Linda Book is divided into six sections, further subdivided into a total of 53 chapters.\n\n* Letters\n* The Book of Adela's Followers \n* The Writings of Adelbrost and Apollonia \n* The Writings of Fr\u00eathorik and Wiljow\n* The Writing of Koner\u00ead\n* Fragments\n\n==See also==\n*[[Old High German lullaby]], an Old High German lullaby mentioning Germanic deities that is also generally held to be a hoax\n*[[Kensington Runestone]], a runestone of supposedly Scandinavian origin found in the United States, considered a hoax by archaeologists and historians\n*[[Germanic mythology]], the historical pre-Christian beliefs of the ancient Germanic peoples\n*[[Pseudohistory]]\n*[[Fakelore]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n* {{Citation |last=Jensma |first=Goffe |contribution=Het Oera Linda-boek.

The text alleges that Europe and other lands were, for a large part of their history, ruled by a succession of folk-mothers presiding over a hierarchical order of celibate priestesses dedicated to the goddess [[Frijjo|Frya]], daughter of the creator god Wr-alda and Jrtha, the earth mother. The claim is also made that this Frisian civilization possessed an alphabet that was the ancestor of the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] and [[Phoenician alphabet]]s. Modern [[historiography]] is essentially ignored, particularly in the area of basic chronology of known events in the recent and distant past of Europe. Geological as well as geographical evidence that was readily available even as far back as Over de Linden's time is also mostly absent from the manuscript.\n\nThe earliest portion of the Oera Linda Book, namely ''Frya\u2019s Tex'', was supposedly composed in 2194 BC, whereas the most recent part, the letter of Hidde Oera Linda, dates to AD 1256. Almost half of the entire book comprises ''The Book of Adela\u2019s Followers'', the original text around which the rest grew. It is purported to have been compiled in the 6th century BC from a mixture of contemporary writings and ancient inscriptions. The last two sections of the Oera Linda Book contain a number of [[lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunae]] and the book itself breaks off in mid-sentence.\n\nIt also describes a lost land called [[Atlantis|Atland]] (the name given to Atlantis by the 17th century scholar [[Olof Rudbeck]]), which was supposedly submerged in 2194 BC, the same year as 19th century Dutch and Frisian almanacs, following traditional Biblical chronology given for [[Deluge (mythology)|Noah's flood]].<ref name=\"Jensma\"/>\n\n===Sections===\n\nThe Oera Linda Book is divided into six sections, further subdivided into a total of 53 chapters.\n\n* Letters\n* The Book of Adela's Followers \n* The Writings of Adelbrost and Apollonia \n* The Writings of Fr\u00eathorik and Wiljow\n* The Writing of Koner\u00ead\n* Fragments\n\n==See also==\n*[[Old High German lullaby]], an Old High German lullaby mentioning Germanic deities that is also generally held to be a hoax\n*[[Kensington Runestone]], a runestone of supposedly Scandinavian origin found in the United States, considered a hoax by archaeologists and historians\n*[[Germanic mythology]], the historical pre-Christian beliefs of the ancient Germanic peoples\n*[[Pseudohistory]]\n*[[Fakelore]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n* {{Citation |last=Jensma |first=Goffe |contribution=Het Oera Linda-boek.

The screenplay by [[Ronald Harwood]] is based on [[Charles Dickens]]\u2019s [[Oliver Twist|1839 novel of the same name]].\n\nThe film was preceded by numerous adaptations of the Dickens book, including several [[feature film]]s, three [[television film]]s, two [[miniseries]], and a [[Oliver!|stage musical]] that became an [[Oliver! (film)|Academy Award-winning film]].\n\nThe film premiered at the [[2005 Toronto International Film Festival]] on 11 September 2005 before going into limited release in the United States on 23 September.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=September 2015}}\nIn the 1830s, a young dwarf (Oliver Twist) is forcibly brought\nto a strip club in England on his ninth birthday. He and the other resident children are treated poorly and given very little food. Facing starvation, the boys select Oliver through a lottery to ask for more food at the next meal, which he does. This results in Oliver being chastised, and one workhouse official decided to have him hanged, but in the end he was offered along with  \u00a35 (roughly \u00a3650 today) to anyone willing to have him as an apprentice. In the end Oliver is sent to Mr. Sowerberry, a coffin-maker, whose wife and senior apprentice take an instant dislike to the newcomer. After more poor treatment, Oliver snaps and attacks Noah, the snotty older apprentice, for having insulted his mother. Noah howls instantly and brings Mrs. Sowerberry and Charlotte rushing in to drag Oliver away and lock him in the cold dark cellar. The violent behavior of the orphan is duly brought to the notice of Mr. Sowerberry. Oliver is beaten, and knowing his life with the Sowerberrys will only get worse, he escapes on foot early the next morning.\n\nWith little food, Oliver determines to walk 70 miles to [[London]]. After a week of travel, he arrives at the city, barefoot and penniless. He meets Jack Dawkins, or \"[[The Artful Dodger]],\" a boy-thief who takes Oliver to his home and hideout at [[Saffron Hill]] that he shares with many other young [[pickpockets]] and their eccentric elderly leader, [[Fagin]]. Soon, Oliver is being groomed to join their gang. On his first outing with the pickpockets, two of the boys steal a man\u2019s handkerchief and Oliver is arrested. However he is proven innocent by an eyewitness, and the owner of the handkerchief (the wealthy [[Mr. Brownlow]]) takes pity on Oliver. Brownlow, believing that Oliver is innocent, informally adopts him, giving him new clothes and the promise of a good education. However, while out running an errand for Brownlow, Oliver is forcibly returned to the pickpocket gang by Fagin\u2019s associate, the evil [[Bill Sikes]], and the young prostitute [[Nancy (Oliver Twist)|Nancy]] (who is in an abusive relationship with Sikes). Fagin and Sikes worry that Oliver would \"peach,\" and tell the authorities about their criminal activity. Oliver is put under supervision until Bill Sikes discovers the boy's connection to the rich Mr. Brownlow. At midnight, Sikes and his accomplice, Toby Crackit, force Oliver to aid them in robbing Brownlow's house. They are discovered and Oliver is wounded in a brief shootout between Brownlow and Sikes. As the three escape, Bill decides to murder Oliver to ensure his silence, but falls into a nearby river before he can take action.\n\nSikes survives his near-drowning, but is confined to bed with a heavy fever. Fagin, despite treating Oliver kindly, remains crime-focused and plots with Sikes to kill Oliver after Sikes has recovered. Nancy has a maternal love for Oliver and does not want to see him hurt. She drugs Bill, and goes to Brownlow's house where she arranges to have him meet her on [[London Bridge]] at midnight so she can provide information about Oliver. At the meeting, Nancy cautiously reveals that Oliver is staying with Fagin, and that the authorities will easily find them. Brownlow leaves to call the police. The Artful Dodger, who had been sent by a suspicious Fagin to spy on Nancy, has heard everything and is bullied by Bill Sikes to give up the information. Sikes is furious at Nancy's betrayal, and brutally beats her to death.\n\nThe next day, information about Oliver and Fagin appear in the newspaper, along with Nancy's murder and the fact that Sikes is a suspect. Sikes's ever-present dog, Bullseye, is a dead giveaway to his identity. After unsuccessfully trying to kill the dog, Sikes takes up residence with Toby Crackit. Fagin, Oliver, and the boys are hiding there too, after escaping their previous location. Bullseye escapes his master's cruelty, and leads a group of police and locals to the group's hideout. Eventually, Dodger, outraged at Sikes for killing the good-hearted Nancy, reveals their location to authorities. Sikes takes Oliver onto the roof, knowing that they won't shoot if the boy is with him. When trying to scale the building using a rope, Sikes, distracted by his dog, loses his footing and accidentally hangs himself to death.\n\nSome time later, Oliver is living comfortably with Mr. Brownlow again. Fagin was arrested for his pick pocketing actions, and Oliver wishes to visit him in jail. Brownlow takes him to the prison, where they find Fagin ranting and wailing in his cell. Oliver is distraught at Fagin's fate, as he had been something of a father figure to him. Oliver tells Fagin \"You were kind to me,\" but soon, their bond breaks when a policeman tells Oliver to leave, thinking that Fagin, wanting to escape execution, can play tricks on the boy's mind. As Mr. Brownlow escorts a tearful Oliver to his own carriage, [[gallows]] are being set up in the courtyard. Townspeople begin to gather to watch Fagin's execution, while Mr Brownlow and Oliver leave to start their new lives afresh.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Ben Kingsley]] as [[Fagin]]\n* [[Jamie Foreman]] as [[Bill Sikes|Bill Sykes]]\n* [[Barney Clark (actor)|Barney Clark]] as [[Oliver Twist (character)|Oliver Twist]]\n* [[Leanne Rowe]] as [[Nancy (Oliver Twist)|Nancy]]\n* [[Edward Hardwicke]] as [[Mr. Brownlow]]\n* [[Harry Eden]] as [[The Artful Dodger]] (Jack Dawkins)\n* [[Mark Strong]] as Toby Crackit\n* [[Frances Cuka]] as Mrs. Bedwin\n* Lewis Chase as [[Charley Bates]]\n* Michael Heath as Mr. Sowerberry\n* [[Gillian Hanna]] as Mrs. Sowerberry\n* Chris Overton as Noah Claypole\n* [[Jeremy Swift]] as [[Bumble (Oliver Twist)|Mr. Bumble]]\n* [[Paul Brooke]] as Mr. Grimwig\n* [[Ian McNeice]] as Mr. Limbkins\n* [[Alun Armstrong]] as Magistrate Fang\n* [[Liz Smith (actress)|Liz Smith]] as Old Woman\n* [[Patrick Godfrey]] as Bookseller\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}\nIn ''Twist by Polanski'', a bonus feature on the DVD release of the film, Roman Polanski discusses his decision to make yet another screen adaptation of the Dickens novel. Following, he was anxious to make a film his children could enjoy. He realized nearly forty years had passed since ''Oliver Twist'' had been adapted for a feature film and felt it was time for a new version. Screenwriter Ronald Harwood, with whom he had collaborated on ''The Pianist'', welcomed the opportunity to work on the first Dickens project in his career.\n\nFor authenticity, all scenes featuring pickpocket skills were choreographed by stage pickpocket [[James Freedman (pickpocket)|James Freedman]] and magician Martyn Rowland.\n\nThe film was shot in [[Prague]], [[Beroun]], and [[\u017datec]] in the [[Czech Republic]].\n\nPolanski and Harwood entirely omitted the Maylie family from their film. Like the musical, but unlike Lean, they also omitted [[Monks (Oliver Twist)|Monks]], as well as the entire subplot of a conspiracy to defraud Oliver of the inheritance money that his father left him. Oliver now has no origin, but is an anonymous orphan like the rest of Fagin's gang. (See more [[Oliver Twist#Poverty and social class|here]].) To fill up the gap left by the absence of Monks and the Maylies, the film creates a subplot wherein Fagin's intentions toward Oliver become murderous and he plots with Sikes to actually kill the boy, which never happens in the novel.\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received mixed to positive reviews, holding a 'fresh' 60% score on [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. The consensus  reads 'Polanski's version of Dickens' classic won't have audiences asking for more because while polished and directed with skill, the movie's a very impersonal experience.'<ref>{{cite web|title=Oliver Twist (1999)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/10005499-oliver_twist/|work=Rotten Tomatoes|publisher=Flixster, Inc|accessdate=18 August 2012|author=Rotten Tomatoes|year=2012}}</ref> Review aggregate website [[Metacritic]] further assigned the film a score of 65, signifying 'generally favorable reviews.'<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/oliver-twist|title=Oliver Twist|website=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=2017-09-16}}</ref>\n\n[[A. O.

There is just enough light, enough grace, enough beauty, to penetrate the gloom and suggest the possibility of redemption.

Oliver is distraught at Fagin's fate, as he had been something of a father figure to him. Oliver tells Fagin \"You were kind to me,\" but soon, their bond breaks when a policeman tells Oliver to leave, thinking that Fagin, wanting to escape execution, can play tricks on the boy's mind. As Mr. Brownlow escorts a tearful Oliver to his own carriage, [[gallows]] are being set up in the courtyard. Townspeople begin to gather to watch Fagin's execution, while Mr Brownlow and Oliver leave to start their new lives afresh.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Ben Kingsley]] as [[Fagin]]\n* [[Jamie Foreman]] as [[Bill Sikes|Bill Sykes]]\n* [[Barney Clark (actor)|Barney Clark]] as [[Oliver Twist (character)|Oliver Twist]]\n* [[Leanne Rowe]] as [[Nancy (Oliver Twist)|Nancy]]\n* [[Edward Hardwicke]] as [[Mr. Brownlow]]\n* [[Harry Eden]] as [[The Artful Dodger]] (Jack Dawkins)\n* [[Mark Strong]] as Toby Crackit\n* [[Frances Cuka]] as Mrs. Bedwin\n* Lewis Chase as [[Charley Bates]]\n* Michael Heath as Mr. Sowerberry\n* [[Gillian Hanna]] as Mrs. Sowerberry\n* Chris Overton as Noah Claypole\n* [[Jeremy Swift]] as [[Bumble (Oliver Twist)|Mr. Bumble]]\n* [[Paul Brooke]] as Mr. Grimwig\n* [[Ian McNeice]] as Mr. Limbkins\n* [[Alun Armstrong]] as Magistrate Fang\n* [[Liz Smith (actress)|Liz Smith]] as Old Woman\n* [[Patrick Godfrey]] as Bookseller\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}\nIn ''Twist by Polanski'', a bonus feature on the DVD release of the film, Roman Polanski discusses his decision to make yet another screen adaptation of the Dickens novel. Following, he was anxious to make a film his children could enjoy. He realized nearly forty years had passed since ''Oliver Twist'' had been adapted for a feature film and felt it was time for a new version. Screenwriter Ronald Harwood, with whom he had collaborated on ''The Pianist'', welcomed the opportunity to work on the first Dickens project in his career.\n\nFor authenticity, all scenes featuring pickpocket skills were choreographed by stage pickpocket [[James Freedman (pickpocket)|James Freedman]] and magician Martyn Rowland.\n\nThe film was shot in [[Prague]], [[Beroun]], and [[\u017datec]] in the [[Czech Republic]].\n\nPolanski and Harwood entirely omitted the Maylie family from their film. Like the musical, but unlike Lean, they also omitted [[Monks (Oliver Twist)|Monks]], as well as the entire subplot of a conspiracy to defraud Oliver of the inheritance money that his father left him. Oliver now has no origin, but is an anonymous orphan like the rest of Fagin's gang. (See more [[Oliver Twist#Poverty and social class|here]].) To fill up the gap left by the absence of Monks and the Maylies, the film creates a subplot wherein Fagin's intentions toward Oliver become murderous and he plots with Sikes to actually kill the boy, which never happens in the novel.\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received mixed to positive reviews, holding a 'fresh' 60% score on [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. The consensus  reads 'Polanski's version of Dickens' classic won't have audiences asking for more because while polished and directed with skill, the movie's a very impersonal experience.'<ref>{{cite web|title=Oliver Twist (1999)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/10005499-oliver_twist/|work=Rotten Tomatoes|publisher=Flixster, Inc|accessdate=18 August 2012|author=Rotten Tomatoes|year=2012}}</ref> Review aggregate website [[Metacritic]] further assigned the film a score of 65, signifying 'generally favorable reviews.'<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/oliver-twist|title=Oliver Twist|website=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=2017-09-16}}</ref>\n\n[[A. O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it a \"bracingly old-fashioned\" film that \"does not embalm its source with fussy reverence\" but \"rediscovers its true and enduring vitality.\" He added, \"the look of the movie... is consistent with its interpretation of Dickens's worldview, which could be plenty grim but which never succumbed to despair. There is just enough light, enough grace, enough beauty, to penetrate the gloom and suggest the possibility of redemption. The script... is at once efficient and ornate, capturing Dickens's narrative dexterity and his ear for the idioms of English speech.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Dickensian Deprivations Delivered From the Gut|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2005/09/23/movies/23oliv.html?_r=1|accessdate=18 August 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=23 September 2005|author=A.O.
