{"title_page": "Music of Tanzania", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2019}}\nAs in other countries, the musical production in Tanzania is constantly undergoing changes. Music listened to by Tanzanians today stretches from traditional [[African music]] or the string-based ''[[taarab]]'' to a distinctive [[hip hop]] known as [[bongo flava]].\n\n==National anthem==\nThe Tanzanian national anthem is ''[[Mungu Ibariki Africa]]'' (God Bless Africa), composed by South African composer [[Enoch Sontonga]] in 1897<ref>[http://www.sahistory.org.za/people/enoch-mankayi-sontonga Enoch Mankayti Sontonga], SAHistory.org.za, accessdate 2020-1-22</ref>. The tune is the [[African National Congress|ANC]]'s official song and later became the national anthem of [[South Africa]]. The melody is also the national anthem of [[Zambia]]. In Tanzania, [[Swahili language|Swahili]] lyrics were written for this anthem. - Another patriotic song, going back to colonial times, is [[Tanzania Nakupenda Kwa Moyo Wote|Tanzania, Tanzania]]. \n\n==Gospel music/choral music==\nModern Gospel, in Swahili ''Muziki wa Injili,'' musicians include:\n\n* Christina Shusho \u2013 Gospel singer\n* Jeniffer Mgend \u2013 Gospel singer\n* Mr. Elliot Andy \u2013 [[Choral music]], university\n* Dionys Mbilinyi \u2013 [[Choral music]], church organist\n* John Mgandu \u2013 [[Choral music]], church organist\n* Sabinus Komba \u2013 [[Choral music]]\n* [[Imani Sanga]] \u2013 [[Choral music]], church organist\n<!--\n* Bernard Mukasa \u2013 Composer and choral conductor\n* Washington Mutayoba \u2013 Composer and choral conductor\n* Amri Hingi \u2013 Composer and choral conductor\n* Isaac Nyato \u2013 Composer and choral conductor\n* Aloyce Ng'asi \u2013 Pianist\n* Dani Simile \u2013 Composer and choral conductor\n*John Maja \u2013 Composer, Church Organist\n* Shanel Komba \u2013 Composer, Church organist, Choral Conductor\n-->\n\n==Bongo Flava/pop music==\nBongo Flava is one of the newer Tanzanian genres, developed in the 1990s, and is a fusion genre. At its inception, Bongo flava was more heavily influenced by US Hip-Hop and Reggae, fused with traditional Tanzanian music styles. Today however, the sound has somewhat changed, oscillating from its central point -music sung in Swahili- to include a variety of music cultures and styles, and can be described as a fusion of Afrobeats, R&B, Reggaeton and Taraab. Its name denotes the Swahilisation of global music forms by incorporating Tanzanian musical and linguistic elements. By adding the 'Flava' (= flavour) of Bongo, the name was born.\n\n\n The current trend among Tanzanian music consumers has started changing from international popular music towards favouring products from their local artists who sing in [[Swahili language|Swahili]], the national language. Popular artists include [[Vanessa Mdee]], [[Diamond Platnumz]] , [[Harmonize (musician)|Harmonize]] , Mbosso, Alikiba, Navy Kenzo, Lava Lava, [[Dully Sykes]], [[Rayvanny]] , P-Funk Majani, Whozu, Marioo, Darassa, [[Nandy_(singer)|Nandy]]. Some of the best known producers include S2Kizzy, Abbah, Lizer classic, Bonga, Kimambo, Blaq and Nahreel.\n\n==Traditional music==\nThe more than 100 [[List of ethnic groups in Tanzania|ethnic groups of Tanzania]] have developed a large number of specific traditional musical and dance styles with corresponding instruments. The [[Zaramo]] people, for instance, perform traditional dance, such as \"''Mitamba Yalagala Kumchuzi''\" on tuned goblet drums, tuned cylindrical drums, and tin rattles.\n\nThe multi-instrumentalist [[Hukwe Zawose]], a member of the [[Gogo (ethnic group)|Gogo]] ethnic group, was the 20th century's most prominent exponent of Tanzanian traditional music.  He specialized in the ''[[ilimba]]'', a large [[lamellophone]] similar to the ''[[mbira]]''.\n\n[[Saida Karoli]] is a famous traditionalist Tanzanian female singer and performer, who sings in [[Haya language|Haya]]. Karoli's music is described as natural with mellow vocals and hypnotically rhythmicism. Her songs ''Ndombolo Ya Solo'' or ''Maria Salome'' were huge hits in Tanzania and the countries around; she was nominated at the 2005 and 2006 [[Tanzania Music Awards]] in the Best Folk Album category<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kilitimetz.com/2005/awards/vote.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515123130/http://www.kilitimetz.com/2005/awards/vote.html|title=Kilitime|archivedate=15 May 2006|work=kilitimetz.com|url-status=dead}}</ref> and for the Best Female Vocalist category.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kilitimetz.com/2006/awards/vote.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061110013751/http://www.kilitimetz.com/2006/awards/vote.html|title=Kilitime|archivedate=10 November 2006|work=kilitimetz.com|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Mtindo==\nA mtindo (pl. ''mitindo'') is simply a rhythm, dance or style identified with a particular band. ''Sikinde'', for example, is associated with Mlimani Park Orchestra, and is derived from the [[ngoma drums|ngoma]] (musical events held by the [[Zaramo]]). Some bands maintain the same ''mtindo'' throughout their career, while others change with new personnel or popular preference.\n\n==Taarab==\n{{Main|Taarab}}\n\n''Taarab'' is a [[music genre]] popular in [[Tanzania]] and [[Kenya]]. It is influenced by the musical traditions of the [[African Great Lakes]], [[North Africa]], the [[Middle East]], and the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Taarab rose to prominence in 1928 with the advent of the genre's first star, [[Siti binti Saad]].\n\n==History of dance music (''dansi'')==\n{{Main|Muziki wa dansi}}\nThe first popular music craze in Tanzania was in the early 1930s, when [[Cuban Rumba]] was widespread. Young Tanzanians organized themselves into dance clubs and their bands, like the [[Dar es Salaam Jazz Band]], which was founded in 1932. Local bands at the time used brass and percussion instruments, later adding strings.  Bands like [[Morogoro Jazz]] and [[Tabora Jazz]] were formed (despite the name, these bands did not play American style [[jazz]]). Competitions were commonplace, a legacy of native [[ngoma drums|ngoma]] societies and colonial [[Beni (music)|beni]] [[brass band]]s.\n\nTanzania was influenced heavily after the 1960s with the influence of African and [[Latin American music|Latin music]]. Tanzanian soldiers brought back with them the music of these cultures, as well as [[Music of Cuba|Cuban]] and European music, when returning from World War II. These musical influences fused and brought together the Tanzanian people. Eventually the country and its people created its own style of music. This style, called \"Swahili [[Jazz]]\" is a mix of beats and styles of Cuban, European, Latin and African music. Swahili jazz gave Tanzania a sense of independence and togetherness as a country.\n\nIndependence came in 1961, however, and three years later the state patronage system was set up, and most of the previous bands fell apart.  Musicians were paid regular fees, plus a percentage of the gate income, and worked for a department of the government.  The first such band is the [[Nuta Jazz Band]], which worked for the [[National Union of Tanzania]].\n\nThe 1970s saw the popularization a laid-back sound popularized by [[Orchestre Safari Sound]] and [[Orchestre Maquis Original]].  These groups adopted the motto \"Kamanyola bila jasho\" (''dance Kamanyola without sweating''). Maquis hailed from [[Lubumbashi]] in southeastern [[Zaire]], moving to Dar es Salaam in the early 70s.  This was a common move at the time, bringing elements of [[soukous]] from the Congo basin. [[Kasalo Kyanga]] composed the 1985 hit \"Karubandika\", which was a popular dance song.\n\nPopular bands in the 60s, 70s and 80s included [[Vijana Jazz]], who were the first to add electronic instruments to dansi (in 1987) and [[DDC Mlimani Park Orchestra]], led by [[Michael Enoch]].  Rivalries between the bands sometimes led to chaos in the scene, as when [[Hugo Kisima]] lured musicians from Mlimani Park and disbanded the wildly popular [[Orchestra Safari Sound]] in 1985, forming the [[International Orchestra Safari Sound]].  International Orchestra Safari Sound was briefly popular, but the Orchestra Safari Sound was revitalized by [[Nguza Viking]] (formerly of [[Maquis (Corsica)|maquis]]), who became bandleader in 1991; this new group lasted only a year.\n\nThe most recent permutation of Tanzanian dance music is [[mchiriku]].  Bands like [[Gari Kubwa]], [[Tokyo Ngma]] and [[Atomic Advantage]] are among the pioneers of this style, which uses four drums and a keyboard for a sparse sound.  Loudness is very important to the style, which is usually blared from out-dated speakers; the resulting feedback is part of the music.  The origin of the style is Zaramo wedding music.\n\n==Hip hop==\n{{Main|Tanzanian hip hop}}\nAfter Tanzania gained its independence, the leaders of the country failed in their mission to produce a successful economy.  Structural Adjustment Programs were put into place, which mimicked the same colonial practices that the country attempted to free itself from.  Tanzanian youths turned to crime to survive. \"It is not surprising that most Tanzanians viewed these conditions, especially the rise in crime, and the almost simultaneous rise or rap music, as a single phenomenon. The political establishment and older generation did not accept rap music or ''uhuni'' music- since it became synonymous with disruption and anti-social behavior.  Yet for the younger generation, traditional Swahili music did not address contradictions of the \u2018liberalized\u2019 Tanzanian economy.\"<ref>Lemelle, Sidney J. \"\u2018Ni wapi Tunakwenda\u2019: Hip Hop Culture and the Children of Arusha.\" In The Vinyl Ain't Final: Hip Hop and the Globalization of Black Popular Culture, ed. by Dipannita Basu and Sidney J. Lemelle, 230-54. London; Ann Arbor, MI: Pluto Pres</ref>\n\nIn 1991, Tanzania hosted a hip hop competition called \"Yo Rap Bonanza.\u201d  While most rappers were performing American songs word for word; Saleh Ajabry, a Tanzanian, wrote his own Swahili lyrics to a song based on Vanilla Ice\u2019s \u201cIce Ice Baby,\u201d and won the competition.<ref>[http://www.afropop.org/multi/interview/ID/67/AFRICAN+HIP+HOP+IN+TANZANIA+-+Highlights+of+a+Conversation+with+Alex+Perullo AFRICAN HIP HOP IN TANZANIA \u2013 Highlights of a Conversation with Alex Perullo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403001733/http://www.afropop.org/multi/interview/ID/67/AFRICAN+HIP+HOP+IN+TANZANIA+-+Highlights+of+a+Conversation+with+Alex+Perullo |date=3 April 2008 }}, 2005.</ref>\n\nDar es Salaam's [[Kwanza Unit]] is the first Tanzanian [[hip hop music|hip hop]] crew, but technical limitations hindered commercial success. [[Mr. II]] and [[Juma Nature]] are the most famous Tanzanian rappers; Mr II's (then known as 2-Proud) \"Ni Mimi\" (1995) is the first major hit for the field. Groups like [[X Plastaz]] have moved away from American-style hip hop and incorporated [[Maasai people|Maasai]] vocal styles and other Tanzanian musics. Tanzanian hip hop is often called as ''Bongo Flava''.\n\nGlobal popular culture, particularly U.S. hip hop, has played a major role in influencing Tanzanian culture since its independence. This is most evident among Tanzanian urban youth, who have absorbed global hip hop music and produced their own varieties. With the increased mediatization of Tanzania in the 1990s, Tanzanian urban youth have had more access to hip hop music, and the incorporation of global culture has become more prevalent and visible in urban Tanzania, not only in the music, but also in fashion, food, dance, and sports.<ref>Remes, Pieter. \"Global Popular Musics and Changing Awareness of Urban Tanzanian Youth.\" ''[[Yearbook for Traditional Music]]''. Vol. 31 (1999), pp. 1\u201326.</ref> Hip hop has essentially provided Tanzanian urban youth and young adults with a means of expressing themselves and forming an identity, such as the conceptual identity of ''msafiri'' (the traveler), a classic subject borrowed from Swahili lore, and a recurrent theme in Dar hip hop.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Lemelle, Sidney J. \"\u2018Ni wapi Tunakwenda\u2019: Hip Hop Culture and the Children of Arusha.\" In The Vinyl Ain't Final: Hip Hop and the Globalization of Black Popular Culture, ed. by Dipannita Basu and Sidney J. Lemelle, 230-54. London; Ann Arbor, MI: Pluto Press.</ref>  While Tanzania hip hop is influenced by American hip hop it is also distinctly localized.  Whereas American Hip Hop is the product of black urban youth and heavily influenced by race, Tanzania [[bongo flava]] took root in the slightly better off part of the city with those that more access to the Western world.  Furthermore, Tanzania hip hop artist saw themselves as distinct from American artists in that they focus more on economic issues and less on violence\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\"  Rapper Sam Stigilydaa put it poignantly when he said, \"American rappers talk about crazy things-drinking, drugs, violence against women, American blacks killing blacks. I hope African doesn't turn crazy\"<ref>James Astil, \"Tanzanian rap breaks free of past,' Guardian (London), 3 February 2001, P.18</ref>\nBecause of the massive hip hop artist and fan base in Northern Tanzania's Arusha city, today this is termed as East Africa's Hip hop capital. Artists such as spark Dog Malik, JCB, Watengwa, Chindo aka Umbwax, Donii, Wadudu wa dampo, Jambo Squad, Nako-to-nako, Weusi, [[Nahreel]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://africasacountry.com/tag/aika-nahreel/|title=Aika & Nahreel|website=africasacountry.com|accessdate=January 18, 2020}}</ref> and many others who are heading Tanzania's hip-hop music are from this City.\n\n==Reggae==\n[[Mbaraka Mwinshehe]] is the most popular and original musician of Tanzania, also there is a greater influx of musicians from the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] (formerly Zaire), who were entering the country as refugees and made residence in the country. But in recent years, mainly from the mid-nineties, new generation of musicians has emerged and are coming up with popular tunes which are Tanzanian in composition. Bands like Twanga Pepeta have managed to carve a new tune distinct from imported Zairean tunes, and are competing with Zairean bands in popularity and audience acceptance.\n\n[[Jah Kimbuteh]] is the first major reggae star in Tanzania, beginning his career with [[Roots and Kulture]] in 1985.  Newer artists in the field include the [[Jam Brothers]] and [[Ras Innocent Nyanyagwa]], who includes songs in [[Hehe language|Hehe]] and Swahili and uses indigenous rhythms.\n\nAt present, [[Ras Nas]] is considered as one of the most known reggae musician from Tanzania. Ras Nas combines reggae, afro and dub poetry. His latest release \"Dar-es-Salaam\" contains eight tracks.\n\nMany musicians work in bands that play at a hotel, usually led by a keyboard and including a rock-based sound.  The [[Kilimanjaro Connection]] is perhaps the most respected of these hotel bands, along with [[Bantu Group]] and [[Tanzanites]].\n\n==Distribution and access to music==\nThe mushrooming of FM music stations and reasonable production studios has been a major boost to the music industry in the country. Contemporary artists like [[Diamond Platnumz]], [[Juma Nature]], [[Lady Jaydee]], [[Mr. Nice]], [[Mr. II]], [[Cool James]], [[Dully Sykes]], [[Professor Jay]] and many others command a huge audience of followers in the country and neighbouring countries.\n\nMore information about Tanzanian music and events can be found on the various web portals that have sprung up recently. Tanzania has an enormously high growth rate for internet technologies, estimated at up to 500% per year. Because costs for computers are still quite high, many users share connections at internet cafes or at work.naomba.com business directory, tanzaniadirectory.info Movie and Sports information, and Arusha locality information all are part of an increasing number of websites dedicated to the region.

[[Mr. II]] and [[Juma Nature]] are the most famous Tanzanian rappers; Mr II's (then known as 2-Proud) \"Ni Mimi\" (1995) is the first major hit for the field. Groups like [[X Plastaz]] have moved away from American-style hip hop and incorporated [[Maasai people|Maasai]] vocal styles and other Tanzanian musics. Tanzanian hip hop is often called as ''Bongo Flava''.\n\nGlobal popular culture, particularly U.S. hip hop, has played a major role in influencing Tanzanian culture since its independence. This is most evident among Tanzanian urban youth, who have absorbed global hip hop music and produced their own varieties. With the increased mediatization of Tanzania in the 1990s, Tanzanian urban youth have had more access to hip hop music, and the incorporation of global culture has become more prevalent and visible in urban Tanzania, not only in the music, but also in fashion, food, dance, and sports.<ref>Remes, Pieter. \"Global Popular Musics and Changing Awareness of Urban Tanzanian Youth.\" ''[[Yearbook for Traditional Music]]''.

Whereas American Hip Hop is the product of black urban youth and heavily influenced by race, Tanzania [[bongo flava]] took root in the slightly better off part of the city with those that more access to the Western world.  Furthermore, Tanzania hip hop artist saw themselves as distinct from American artists in that they focus more on economic issues and less on violence\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\"  Rapper Sam Stigilydaa put it poignantly when he said, \"American rappers talk about crazy things-drinking, drugs, violence against women, American blacks killing blacks. I hope African doesn't turn crazy\"<ref>James Astil, \"Tanzanian rap breaks free of past,' Guardian (London), 3 February 2001, P.18</ref>\nBecause of the massive hip hop artist and fan base in Northern Tanzania's Arusha city, today this is termed as East Africa's Hip hop capital. Artists such as spark Dog Malik, JCB, Watengwa, Chindo aka Umbwax, Donii, Wadudu wa dampo, Jambo Squad, Nako-to-nako, Weusi, [[Nahreel]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://africasacountry.com/tag/aika-nahreel/|title=Aika & Nahreel|website=africasacountry.com|accessdate=January 18, 2020}}</ref> and many others who are heading Tanzania's hip-hop music are from this City.\n\n==Reggae==\n[[Mbaraka Mwinshehe]] is the most popular and original musician of Tanzania, also there is a greater influx of musicians from the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] (formerly Zaire), who were entering the country as refugees and made residence in the country. But in recent years, mainly from the mid-nineties, new generation of musicians has emerged and are coming up with popular tunes which are Tanzanian in composition. Bands like Twanga Pepeta have managed to carve a new tune distinct from imported Zairean tunes, and are competing with Zairean bands in popularity and audience acceptance.\n\n[[Jah Kimbuteh]] is the first major reggae star in Tanzania, beginning his career with [[Roots and Kulture]] in 1985.  Newer artists in the field include the [[Jam Brothers]] and [[Ras Innocent Nyanyagwa]], who includes songs in [[Hehe language|Hehe]] and Swahili and uses indigenous rhythms.\n\nAt present, [[Ras Nas]] is considered as one of the most known reggae musician from Tanzania. Ras Nas combines reggae, afro and dub poetry. His latest release \"Dar-es-Salaam\" contains eight tracks.\n\nMany musicians work in bands that play at a hotel, usually led by a keyboard and including a rock-based sound.  The [[Kilimanjaro Connection]] is perhaps the most respected of these hotel bands, along with [[Bantu Group]] and [[Tanzanites]].\n\n==Distribution and access to music==\nThe mushrooming of FM music stations and reasonable production studios has been a major boost to the music industry in the country. Contemporary artists like [[Diamond Platnumz]], [[Juma Nature]], [[Lady Jaydee]], [[Mr. Nice]], [[Mr. II]], [[Cool James]], [[Dully Sykes]], [[Professor Jay]] and many others command a huge audience of followers in the country and neighbouring countries.\n\nMore information about Tanzanian music and events can be found on the various web portals that have sprung up recently. Tanzania has an enormously high growth rate for internet technologies, estimated at up to 500% per year. Because costs for computers are still quite high, many users share connections at internet cafes or at work.naomba.com business directory, tanzaniadirectory.info Movie and Sports information, and Arusha locality information all are part of an increasing number of websites dedicated to the region.

The northeastern part has northwest-trending faults.<ref name=\":1\" /> The faults in the remaining southern part possess an east\u2013west direction.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Growth history of the terranes ==\nThe [[craton]]-forming terranes are created from very diverse settings, such as [[Volcanic arc|oceanic arc]], ancient [[forearc]], oceanic tectonic melange, uplift within the craton, [[Fold and thrust belt|fold-thrust belt]] and extra. Common among them is that these features were mostly formed in a compression setting. \n[[File:Volcanic Arc System SVG en.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Some of the terranes were formed from the structures of a volcanic arc, including the volcanic arc chain and the forearc setting.]]\n\n=== Oceanic arc setting ===\nSome terranes, such as the Western Wabigoon Terrane, are formed from the setting of an oceanic arc. An oceanic arc is a chain of [[volcano]]es which formed above and parallel to the [[Subduction|subduction zones]]. Due to tectonic activities in the Earth, the relevant continental and oceanic crusts collided before 2.70 Ga.<ref name=\":10\" /> The denser oceanic crust subducted underneath the continental crust and melted into the [[Earth's mantle|mantle]], which generated more [[magma]]. The huge amount of magma then rose up, penetrated through the crust above and erupted. The continuous eruption of volcanic material cooled down and accumulated around the centers of eruption, forming a chain of volcanoes in the shape of an arc.<ref name=\"Grove, T. L. 2009\">Grove, T.

''Nature'', ''459''(7247), 694.</ref>\n\n=== Ancient forearc basin setting ===\nSome terranes, such as the Quetico Terrane, were [[forearc]]s in the past. A forearc is the region between the volcanic arc and the subduction zone. It includes several components, including the subduction [[Oceanic trench|trench]], the outer arc high of the oceanic crust, the [[accretionary wedge]]s, and the [[sedimentary basin]]. The outer arc high is formed by the flexural upward motion of the oceanic crust edge before it enters the subduction zone. The accretionary wedges are formed from the accumulation of marine sediment scraped off from the oceanic crust before it is subducted. The sedimentary basin is formed from the accumulation of erosive material from the volcanoes, which lying flatly between the volcanoes and the topographic high of the accretionary wedge.<ref name=\"Grove, T. L. 2009\"/>\n\n=== Uplift setting ===\nSome terranes, such as the Kapuskasing Uplift, were formed from the uplifting of the crustal block. For example, during 1.85 Ga, the American Midcontinent and the Superior Craton collided. The collision between the two cratons triggered an Archean [[Fault (geology)|reverse fault]], the Ivanhoe Lake fault. The upward movement of the hanging wall causes the uplift of a crustal block, known as the Kapuskasing Uplift.<ref>Zhang, B. (1999).

A fold-thrust belt is a zone consisting of a series of thrusts (reverse faults) and [[Thrust fault|fault-bend folds]] separated by main thrust faults. The fold-thrust belt is formed in a compression setting like crust collision. when the crust is compressed, thrusts dipping towards where the compression comes formed.

In the northwestern part, faulting occurs in a west\u2013northwest direction. The northeastern part has northwest-trending faults.<ref name=\":1\" /> The faults in the remaining southern part possess an east\u2013west direction.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Growth history of the terranes ==\nThe [[craton]]-forming terranes are created from very diverse settings, such as [[Volcanic arc|oceanic arc]], ancient [[forearc]], oceanic tectonic melange, uplift within the craton, [[Fold and thrust belt|fold-thrust belt]] and extra. Common among them is that these features were mostly formed in a compression setting. \n[[File:Volcanic Arc System SVG en.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Some of the terranes were formed from the structures of a volcanic arc, including the volcanic arc chain and the forearc setting.]]\n\n=== Oceanic arc setting ===\nSome terranes, such as the Western Wabigoon Terrane, are formed from the setting of an oceanic arc. An oceanic arc is a chain of [[volcano]]es which formed above and parallel to the [[Subduction|subduction zones]]. Due to tectonic activities in the Earth, the relevant continental and oceanic crusts collided before 2.70 Ga.<ref name=\":10\" /> The denser oceanic crust subducted underneath the continental crust and melted into the [[Earth's mantle|mantle]], which generated more [[magma]]. The huge amount of magma then rose up, penetrated through the crust above and erupted. The continuous eruption of volcanic material cooled down and accumulated around the centers of eruption, forming a chain of volcanoes in the shape of an arc.<ref name=\"Grove, T. L. 2009\">Grove, T. L., Till, C. B., Lev, E., Chatterjee, N., & M\u00e9dard, E. (2009). Kinematic variables and water transport control the formation and location of arc volcanoes. ''Nature'', ''459''(7247), 694.</ref>\n\n=== Ancient forearc basin setting ===\nSome terranes, such as the Quetico Terrane, were [[forearc]]s in the past. A forearc is the region between the volcanic arc and the subduction zone. It includes several components, including the subduction [[Oceanic trench|trench]], the outer arc high of the oceanic crust, the [[accretionary wedge]]s, and the [[sedimentary basin]]. The outer arc high is formed by the flexural upward motion of the oceanic crust edge before it enters the subduction zone. The accretionary wedges are formed from the accumulation of marine sediment scraped off from the oceanic crust before it is subducted. The sedimentary basin is formed from the accumulation of erosive material from the volcanoes, which lying flatly between the volcanoes and the topographic high of the accretionary wedge.<ref name=\"Grove, T. L. 2009\"/>\n\n=== Uplift setting ===\nSome terranes, such as the Kapuskasing Uplift, were formed from the uplifting of the crustal block. For example, during 1.85 Ga, the American Midcontinent and the Superior Craton collided. The collision between the two cratons triggered an Archean [[Fault (geology)|reverse fault]], the Ivanhoe Lake fault. The upward movement of the hanging wall causes the uplift of a crustal block, known as the Kapuskasing Uplift.<ref>Zhang, B. (1999).

A fold-thrust belt is a zone consisting of a series of thrusts (reverse faults) and [[Thrust fault|fault-bend folds]] separated by main thrust faults. The fold-thrust belt is formed in a compression setting like crust collision. when the crust is compressed, thrusts dipping towards where the compression comes formed. The hanging walls of the thrusts slide up along the fault plane and stacks above the footwall, forming a ramp [[anticline]] or [[Thrust fault|fault-bend fold]].<ref>Poblet, J., & Lisle, R. J. (2011).

Apart from the ceased magmatism, the sanukitoid plutons formed in the area during 2695-2685 Ma (which inferred the breakoff of a subduction slab) also indicated the subduction towards the north. After the subduction, the two terranes were sutured under the Quetico belt. This also trapped the clastic sediments fluxing into the belt, marking its transition from an accretionary wedge to a [[foreland basin]].<ref name=\":3\" /> At the northern Wawa-Abitibi terrane, researchers identified two events of deformation occurred during the orogeny. The first one (D<sub>1</sub> deformation event) is the intra-arc deformation accompanied by calc-alkaline magmatism during 2695 Ma.

While his season started slowly, by finishing in the lower 3rd of the field in his first 3 road/street courses events of the season, he proved to be a quick study on the ovals.

After qualifying 23rd, with a conservative setup, he was on top of the speed charts again during the post-qualifying practice and 7th quick during Carb Day.  Considered to be a dark horse favorite on race day, it was all for naught as he was forced to settle with a 32nd place finish in the [[2015 Indianapolis 500]], after contact with [[Takuma Sato]].

After qualifying 23rd, with a conservative setup, he was on top of the speed charts again during the post-qualifying practice and 7th quick during Carb Day.

There is no written record of any visit to the site until 1805, when Lt. [[Zebulon Pike]] mounted an expedition up the Mississippi River for the United States. Pike recorded the location's name as \"Prairie La Crosse.\" The name originated from the game with sticks that resembled a bishop's [[crozier]] or ''[[lacrosse|la crosse]]'' in French, which was played by Native Americans there.<ref>Wisconsin Historical Society. [https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Records/Article/CS9524 La Crosse: Origin of La Crosse, Wisconsin]. Retrieved October 24, 2017.</ref><ref>Diary of Zebulon Pike, September 12, 1805, in Elliott Coues, ''[https://archive.org/details/expeditionsofzeb01pike <!-- quote=The Expeditions of Zebulon Pike. --> The Expeditions of Zebulon Montgomery Pike]'', Vol. 1. New York: Harper, 1895, pp. 49-51.</ref>\n\nThe first white settlement at La Crosse occurred in 1841 when [[Nathan Myrick]], a New York native, moved to the village at [[Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin]] to work in the [[fur trade]]. Myrick was disappointed to find that because many fur traders were already well-entrenched there, there were no openings for him in the trade. As a result, he decided to establish a trading post upriver at the then still unsettled site of Prairie La Crosse. In 1841, he built a temporary trading post on Barron Island (now called Pettibone Park), which lies just west of La Crosse's present downtown. The following year, Myrick relocated the post to the mainland prairie, partnering with H. J. B. Miller to run the outfit.<ref>[http://www.lacrosselibrary.org/genealogy/laxhistory/Ethnicity.asp La Crosse County History: Brief History of La Crosse County, 1841-1905].

It was near the junction of the [[Black River (Wisconsin)|Black]], [[La Crosse River|La Crosse]], and Mississippi Rivers. In addition, the post was built at one of the few points along the Wisconsin side of the Mississippi River where a broad plain ideal for development existed between the river's bank and the tall [[Hill|bluffs]] that line the river valley. Because of these advantages, a small village grew around Myrick's trading post in the 1840s.\n\nA small [[Mormon]] community settled at La Crosse in 1844, building several dozen cabins a few miles south of Myrick's post. Although these settlers relocated away from the [[Midwest]] after just a year, the land they occupied near La Crosse continues to bear the name Mormon Coulee.<ref>[https://archive.today/20130113081132/http://www.strangite.org/Wisconsin.htm Mormons in Wisconsin<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOn June 23, 1850, Father [[James Lloyd Breck]] of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] said the first Christian liturgy on top of [[Grandad Bluff]].<ref>{{cite book |url=http://anglicanhistory.org/usa/jlbreck/letters/01.html |editor=Charles Breck |title=The Life of the Reverend James Lloyd Breck, D.D. |location=New York |publisher=E. & J.

Under the direction of [[Timothy Burns (Wisconsin politician)|Timothy Burns]], lieutenant governor of Wisconsin, surveyor William Hood platted the village in 1851. This opened it up for further settlement, which was achieved rapidly as a result of promotion of the city in eastern newspapers. By 1855, La Crosse had grown in population to nearly 2,000 residents, leading to its incorporation in 1856. The city grew even more rapidly after 1858 with the completion of the La Crosse & Milwaukee Railroad, the second railroad connecting [[Milwaukee]] to the Mississippi River.\n\nDuring the second half of the 19th century, La Crosse grew to become one of the largest cities in Wisconsin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://visitbluffcountry.com/wisconsin/la-crosse/|title=La Crosse|website=visitbluffcountry.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-06}}</ref> It was a center of the lumber industry, for logs cut in the interior of the state could be rafted down the Black River toward [[sawmill]]s built in the city. La Crosse also became a center for the [[brewing]] industry and other manufacturers that saw advantages in the city's location adjacent to major transportation arteries, such as the Mississippi River and the railroad between Milwaukee and [[St. Paul, Minnesota]]. Around the turn of the 20th century, the city also became a center for education, with three colleges and universities established in the city between 1890 and 1912.\n\nIn 2016, Mayors Tim Kabat and John Medinger issued a proclamation apologizing for La Crosse's history as a [[sundown town]] that discriminated against African Americans.<ref>{{cite news|title=La Crosse mayors acknowledge city's inequitable past|first=Jourdan|last=Vian|work=Star Tribune|location=Minneapolis|date=December 11, 2016|page=B8|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/29386351/|via=Newspapers.com|quote=The proclamation came a little over a month after Kabat apologized for La Crosse's history as a 'sundown town,' a city or village with either formal or informal codes that pushed black people out of the community after sundown, after a presentation from sociologist [[James W.

Loewen was invited by the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013La Crosse|University of Wisconsin-La Crosse]] and the city's Human Rights Commission.}}</ref>\n\nLa Crosse remains the largest city on Wisconsin's western border, and the educational institutions in the city have recently led it toward becoming a regional technology and medical hub.\n{{wide image|La Crosse river front.jpeg|1000px|alt=La Crosse riverfront|La Crosse riverfront}}\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Grandadbluff.jpg|thumb|right|[[Grandad Bluff]] in La Crosse]]\nLa Crosse is located on the western border of the midsection of [[Wisconsin]], on a broad [[alluvium|alluvial]] plain along the east side of the [[Mississippi River]]. The [[Black River (Wisconsin)|Black River]] empties into the Mississippi north of the city, and the [[La Crosse River]] flows into the Mississippi just north of the downtown area. Just upriver from its mouth, this river broadens into a marshland that splits the city into two distinct sections, north and south.\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|22.54|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|20.52|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|2.02|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=November 18, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112090031/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=January 12, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nSurrounding the relatively flat [[prairie]] valley where La Crosse lies are towering 500&nbsp;ft [[Hill|bluffs]], one of the most prominent of which is [[Grandad Bluff]] (mentioned in ''[[Life on the Mississippi]]'' by [[Mark Twain]]), which has an overlook of the three states region. This feature typifies the topography of the [[Driftless Area]] in which La Crosse sits. This rugged region is composed of high ridges dissected by narrow valleys called [[coulee]]s, a French term.

There is no written record of any visit to the site until 1805, when Lt. [[Zebulon Pike]] mounted an expedition up the Mississippi River for the United States. Pike recorded the location's name as \"Prairie La Crosse.\" The name originated from the game with sticks that resembled a bishop's [[crozier]] or ''[[lacrosse|la crosse]]'' in French, which was played by Native Americans there.<ref>Wisconsin Historical Society. [https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Records/Article/CS9524 La Crosse: Origin of La Crosse, Wisconsin]. Retrieved October 24, 2017.</ref><ref>Diary of Zebulon Pike, September 12, 1805, in Elliott Coues, ''[https://archive.org/details/expeditionsofzeb01pike <!-- quote=The Expeditions of Zebulon Pike. --> The Expeditions of Zebulon Montgomery Pike]'', Vol. 1. New York: Harper, 1895, pp. 49-51.</ref>\n\nThe first white settlement at La Crosse occurred in 1841 when [[Nathan Myrick]], a New York native, moved to the village at [[Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin]] to work in the [[fur trade]]. Myrick was disappointed to find that because many fur traders were already well-entrenched there, there were no openings for him in the trade. As a result, he decided to establish a trading post upriver at the then still unsettled site of Prairie La Crosse. In 1841, he built a temporary trading post on Barron Island (now called Pettibone Park), which lies just west of La Crosse's present downtown. The following year, Myrick relocated the post to the mainland prairie, partnering with H. J. B. Miller to run the outfit.<ref>[http://www.lacrosselibrary.org/genealogy/laxhistory/Ethnicity.asp La Crosse County History: Brief History of La Crosse County, 1841-1905]. La Crosse Public Library. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013124207/http://lacrosselibrary.org/genealogy/laxhistory/Ethnicity.asp |date=October 13, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe spot Myrick chose to build his trading post proved ideal for settlement. It was near the junction of the [[Black River (Wisconsin)|Black]], [[La Crosse River|La Crosse]], and Mississippi Rivers. In addition, the post was built at one of the few points along the Wisconsin side of the Mississippi River where a broad plain ideal for development existed between the river's bank and the tall [[Hill|bluffs]] that line the river valley. Because of these advantages, a small village grew around Myrick's trading post in the 1840s.\n\nA small [[Mormon]] community settled at La Crosse in 1844, building several dozen cabins a few miles south of Myrick's post. Although these settlers relocated away from the [[Midwest]] after just a year, the land they occupied near La Crosse continues to bear the name Mormon Coulee.<ref>[https://archive.today/20130113081132/http://www.strangite.org/Wisconsin.htm Mormons in Wisconsin<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOn June 23, 1850, Father [[James Lloyd Breck]] of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] said the first Christian liturgy on top of [[Grandad Bluff]].<ref>{{cite book |url=http://anglicanhistory.org/usa/jlbreck/letters/01.html |editor=Charles Breck |title=The Life of the Reverend James Lloyd Breck, D.D. |location=New York |publisher=E. & J.

Under the direction of [[Timothy Burns (Wisconsin politician)|Timothy Burns]], lieutenant governor of Wisconsin, surveyor William Hood platted the village in 1851. This opened it up for further settlement, which was achieved rapidly as a result of promotion of the city in eastern newspapers. By 1855, La Crosse had grown in population to nearly 2,000 residents, leading to its incorporation in 1856. The city grew even more rapidly after 1858 with the completion of the La Crosse & Milwaukee Railroad, the second railroad connecting [[Milwaukee]] to the Mississippi River.\n\nDuring the second half of the 19th century, La Crosse grew to become one of the largest cities in Wisconsin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://visitbluffcountry.com/wisconsin/la-crosse/|title=La Crosse|website=visitbluffcountry.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-06}}</ref> It was a center of the lumber industry, for logs cut in the interior of the state could be rafted down the Black River toward [[sawmill]]s built in the city. La Crosse also became a center for the [[brewing]] industry and other manufacturers that saw advantages in the city's location adjacent to major transportation arteries, such as the Mississippi River and the railroad between Milwaukee and [[St. Paul, Minnesota]]. Around the turn of the 20th century, the city also became a center for education, with three colleges and universities established in the city between 1890 and 1912.\n\nIn 2016, Mayors Tim Kabat and John Medinger issued a proclamation apologizing for La Crosse's history as a [[sundown town]] that discriminated against African Americans.<ref>{{cite news|title=La Crosse mayors acknowledge city's inequitable past|first=Jourdan|last=Vian|work=Star Tribune|location=Minneapolis|date=December 11, 2016|page=B8|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/29386351/|via=Newspapers.com|quote=The proclamation came a little over a month after Kabat apologized for La Crosse's history as a 'sundown town,' a city or village with either formal or informal codes that pushed black people out of the community after sundown, after a presentation from sociologist [[James W.

The [[Black River (Wisconsin)|Black River]] empties into the Mississippi north of the city, and the [[La Crosse River]] flows into the Mississippi just north of the downtown area. Just upriver from its mouth, this river broadens into a marshland that splits the city into two distinct sections, north and south.\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|22.54|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|20.52|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|2.02|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=November 18, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112090031/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=January 12, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nSurrounding the relatively flat [[prairie]] valley where La Crosse lies are towering 500&nbsp;ft [[Hill|bluffs]], one of the most prominent of which is [[Grandad Bluff]] (mentioned in ''[[Life on the Mississippi]]'' by [[Mark Twain]]), which has an overlook of the three states region. This feature typifies the topography of the [[Driftless Area]] in which La Crosse sits. This rugged region is composed of high ridges dissected by narrow valleys called [[coulee]]s, a French term.

She championed sexual rights and health movements for more than 20 years, particularly on HIV/AIDS, after initially starting out as a small businesses owner with her own fashion label.\n\n==Early life and career==\nPatten was born in [[Canberra, Australian Capital Territory]], the daughter of Colin Richard Lloyd \"Rick\" Patten, an Australian naval officer, and his wife Anne, a Scottish-born public servant who worked for a government-owned telecommunications company.{{ref|http://www.afr.com/news/politics/national/sex-partys-fiona-patten-on-her-journey-from-parlour-to-parliament-20141226-12k7l2}}\n\nRick and Anne Patten had met in [[Scotland]], where the former had been posted, and after her birth Patten spent parts of her childhood in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]], in concert with her father's postings. Patten has two younger sisters.\n\nPatten received her primary education overseas. She excelled in sport and took particular interest in swimming. Upon returning to [[Australia]] with her family in 1978, Patten attended [[Hawker College]] in Canberra where she studied Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Industrial Arts, Technical Drawing, Landscape Design and Environmental Studies. She went on to study Landscape Architecture and Industrial Design at the [[University of Canberra]]. She later graduated with qualifications in fashion design and started her own fashion label, ''Body Politics''. The first [[boutique]] was opened in [[Yarralumla, Australian Capital Territory|Yarralumla]] in the late 1980s, where she sold her own fashion creations as well as the designs of colleagues in [[Sydney]]. During the [[early 1990s recession in Australia]], interest in Patten's expensive collection was received largely from workers in the [[sex industry]].{{ref|http://www.smh.com.au/good-weekend/now-that-sex-party-mp-fiona-patten-has-your-attention--20160211-gmr6ge.html}}{{ref|http://www.afr.com/news/politics/national/sex-partys-fiona-patten-on-her-journey-from-parlour-to-parliament-20141226-12k7l2}}\n\n==Business career, 1988\u20132014==\n\n===Body Politics===\nPatten started her career with her company ''Body Politics''. With her large clientele of sex workers, Patten became interested in [[sex workers' rights]], eventually joining ''Workers In Sex Employment'' (WISE), a lobbying group, to inform at-risk members of the population about the emerging threat of HIV/AIDS. Patten was employed as an outreach speaker, and would once a week visit brothels to teach the women about safe sex.{{ref|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBhh_U-PjGE}}{{ref|http://www.bodypolitics.com.au/}}\n\nFrom 1990 to 1992, Patten was a sex worker herself. Her initial encounter began at ''Tiffany's Palace'' in Canberra, where she had intercourse with a client when another worker was unavailable.{{ref|http://www.afr.com/news/politics/national/sex-partys-fiona-patten-on-her-journey-from-parlour-to-parliament-20141226-12k7l2}}\n\n{{quotation|\"I remember it all very clearly and thinking afterwards: how easy was that?

Upon returning to [[Australia]] with her family in 1978, Patten attended [[Hawker College]] in Canberra where she studied Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Industrial Arts, Technical Drawing, Landscape Design and Environmental Studies. She went on to study Landscape Architecture and Industrial Design at the [[University of Canberra]]. She later graduated with qualifications in fashion design and started her own fashion label, ''Body Politics''. The first [[boutique]] was opened in [[Yarralumla, Australian Capital Territory|Yarralumla]] in the late 1980s, where she sold her own fashion creations as well as the designs of colleagues in [[Sydney]].

Several of his films are classics in the genre of visual music.\n\n==Early life==\n\nJames Whitney was born December 27, 1921, in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], [[California]], and lived all his life in the [[Los Angeles]] area. He studied painting, and traveled in England before the outbreak of World War II. In 1940, he returned to Pasadena.\n\n==Career \u2013 early works ==\nJames completed a number of short films over four decades, two of which required at least five years of work. James collaborated with his brother John for some of his early film work.\n\nThe first of the brothers' films was ''[[Twenty-Four Variations on an Original Theme]]''. Its structure was influenced by [[Schoenberg]]'s serial principles.\n\nJames spent 3 years working on ''[[Variations on a Circle]]'' (1942), which lasts some 20 minutes, and was made with [[8mm film]].\n\nJames and John created their series of Five ''[[Film Exercises]]'' (John #1 and #5; James #2, #3 and #4) between 1943 and 1944, for which the brothers won a prize for best sound at the 1949 Brussels Experimental Film Competition.\n\nIn 1946, the brothers travelled to [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]] to show their films at the first of ten annual \"Art in Cinema\" festivals, organized by [[Frank Stauffacher]].\n\nFollowing this period, James became more involved in spiritual interests such as [[Jungian psychology]], [[alchemy]], [[yoga]], [[Tao]], and [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]].  These interests heavily influenced his later work.\nJames was a potter and ceramicist, interested in raku ware, and examples of his pottery still exist today.\n\n==Career \u2013 later works ==\n[[Image:JWlapis.jpg|thumb|300px|Screenshot from \"'''Lapis'''\" by James Whitney]]\n<!-- FAIR USE of IMAGENAME.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:JWlapis.jpg for rationale -->\n\nBetween 1950 and 1955, James laboured to construct a truly astounding masterpiece, ''[[Yantra (film)|Yantra]]''. The film was produced entirely by hand. By punching grid patterns in 5\" by 7\" cards with a pin, James was able to paint through these pinholes onto other 5\" x 7\" cards, to create images of rich complexity and give the finished work a very dynamic and flowing motion, but the film was not completed yet. It was first released as a silent film.\n\nA very short, black and white, manipulated fragment from an early version of ''Yantra'' was shown at one of the historic [[Vortex Concerts]] in [[San Francisco]]'s Morrison [[planetarium]] in early 1959. Soon after Vortex, the film acquired its soundtrack, when Jordan Belson synchronized it to an excerpt from [[Henk Badings]]\u2019 \"Cain and Abel\". This did not occur at the Morrison Planetarium Vortex Concerts, contrary to popular belief (Keefer, 2008).\n\n[[Analogue computer|Analogue computer equipment]] developed by brother John, allowed James to complete ''[[Lapis (film)|Lapis]]'' (1966) in two years, when it might have taken seven years otherwise. James drew dot patterns again for this film, but the camera was positioned using computer control, allowing each image to be overlaid from multiple angles. In this piece, smaller circles oscillate in and out in an array of colors resembling a [[kaleidoscope]] while being accompanied by Indian [[sitar]] music. The patterns become hypnotic and trance inducing.\n\n''Dwija'' (1973), meaning \"twice-born\" or \"soul\" in [[Sanskrit]], is completely [[solarisation|solarized]], and much of the imagery is re-photographed by rear-projection to create a constant flow of hardly definable transformations of color and form.\n\n''Wu Ming'' (1977), meaning \"no name\" in [[Chinese language|Chinese]], repeats a single action over and over - a particle disappears into infinity, and returns as a wave. James described the particle-to-wave action in Wu Ming as being \"like throwing a pebble into water and seeing the ripples spread out\".\n\nHis two final films, intended to form a quartet with ''Dwija'' and ''Wu Ming'', were ''[[Kang Jing Xiang]]'' and ''[[Li (film)|Li]]'', which were left incomplete when James died April 8, 1982, after a brief and unexpected illness. Kang was completed post-humously according to James' instructions.  His short test for Li is believed to be lost.\n\nSeveral of James' films were preserved by Center for Visual Music (CVM) in Los Angeles; HD transfers from their preservation project were seen in major museum exhibitions including Visual Music at MOCA and The Hirshhorn Museum (2005), Sons et Lumieres at Centre Pompidou (2004\u201305), The Third Mind at The Guggenheim Museum, and other shows. Scholars may view high quality copies of Yantra and Lapis at CVM. CVM also provided prints from this preservation to Centre Pompidou, Paris, which provided support for this project.
