Before [[Local Government Act 1972|boundary changes in 1974]], both ends of the tunnel were in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]]. Three are [[Rail transport|railway]] tunnels and the other is a [[canal]] tunnel.\n\nThe canal tunnel on the [[Huddersfield Narrow Canal]] was authorised by an [[Act of Parliament]] on 4 April 1794. Construction of a {{convert|5451|yd|m|adj=on}}-long tunnel began months later.<ref name=\"Ellis 2017 105\">{{harvnb|Ellis|2017|p=105}}</ref> Within two years, cost-saving measures pushed back its completion date and progress was slowed by the high levels of water which were much greater than had been expected. It proved difficult to secure skilled help, some tenders went unanswered and [[Benjamin Outram]] withdrew from the venture. In 1807, [[Thomas Telford]] drew up a new plan for its completion. In 1811, the tunnel opened. It is the longest and oldest of the four Standedge tunnels and is the longest and highest canal tunnel in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.standedge.co.uk/about.htm|title=Transportation Uses - Standedge Tunnels|work=standedge.co.uk|accessdate=4 September 2010}}</ref> Having been closed to all traffic in 1943, the canal tunnel was re-opened in May 2001.\n\nThe first, single-track railway tunnel, built for the [[London and North Western Railway]] (LNWR) on its line between Huddersfield and Manchester, was completed in 1848. It proved to have insufficient capacity and a second, parallel, single-track tunnel was opened in 1871. The LNWR opened a third, double-track tunnel in 1894. All four tunnels are linked by cross-tunnels or [[adit]]s at strategic intervals, which allowed the railway tunnels to be built without construction shafts, and allowed waste material to be removed by boat. Only the double-track tunnel is currently used for rail traffic. The others are intact but disused. The Standedge Tunnel Visitor Centre at the Marsden end, is a base for boat trips into the tunnel and has an exhibition depicting the different crossings.\n\n==Canal tunnel==\n{{Standedge Tunnel map}}\n[[File:Standedge canal tunnel - geograph.org.uk - 1410632.jpg|right|thumb|Inside the canal tunnel]]\n\n===Construction===\nOn 4 April 1794, construction of the ''Huddersfield Narrow Canal'' (then known as the ''Huddersfield Canal''), linking [[Ashton-under-Lyne]] and [[Huddersfield]] via a tunnel was authorised by an [[Act of Parliament]].<ref name = \"stan exp14\"/> [[Benjamin Outram]] was appointed  the consulting engineer after his report in October 1793 estimated the cost of the canal and tunnel at \u00a3178,478. Nicholas Brown surveyed the route. Outram thought that geology of the hill through which the tunnel would pass was of [[gritstone]] and shale, and not present any difficulties. Work on the {{convert|5456|yd|m|adj=on}} tunnel would start at a dip in the hill at Red Brook and the tunnel would be driven simultaneously from both ends. [[Steam engine]]s would keep the works drained during construction.<ref>{{harvnb |Hadfield |Biddle |1970 |pp=322\u2013323}}</ref>\n\nOutram was the site engineer and Brown was superintendent and surveyor. During July 1795, John Evans was appointed to manage boring the tunnel. By mid-1796, {{convert|795|yd|m}} of tunnel had been cut, some of which had been lined. Considerable effort had been spent constructing small tunnels to supply waterwheels to raise spoil and water from intermediate [[adit]]s.<ref name = \"stan exp14\"/> By the autumn, concern that such work was expensive and Outram abandoned building extra workfaces and concentrated on boring out from both ends. Although cheaper, the completion date was extended.<ref name = \"had 3245\"/>\n\nOther factors had slowed progress; a shortage of funding and poor working practices also contributed.<ref name=\"stan exp14\">Bickerdike, Graeme. [https://www.railengineer.uk/2014/04/03/the-standedge-experience/ \"The Standedge experience.\"] ''Rail Engineer'', 3 April 2014.</ref> Cutbacks in drainage provision hampered tunnelling as larger quantities of water entered the workings. In September 1797, Outram advised the committee that Thomas Lee, the contractor, had made large losses as a result of the difficulties and could not complete his contract. He was awarded more money for timber, an increased rate per yard for completion and an extra year in which to finish the tunnel.<ref name=\"had 3245\">{{harvnb |Hadfield |Biddle |1970 |pp=324\u2013325}}</ref>\n\nBy mid 1799, {{convert|1000|yd|m}} of the tunnel had been finished and {{convert|1000|yd|m}} had been excavated, but not completed. In October 1800, the [[Peak Forest Canal]] Company, who were keen to trade, suggested a tram road should be built to bypass the tunnel until it was completed but no action was taken. The next tunnel contract failed to attract any takers and canal engineer [[John Varley (canal engineer)|John Varley]], who had repaired parts of the canal which had been damaged by floods, was invited to work on the tunnel. Soon thereafter,  mine owner [[Matthew Fletcher (mine owner and engineer)|Matthew Fletcher]] was asked for his opinion; he suggested that time could be saved by tunnelling in both directions from Redbrook pit, which was kept dry by a large steam engine. He estimated that it would cost \u00a38,000 but a contractor could not be found and tunnelling continued from both ends.<ref>{{harvnb |Hadfield |Biddle |1970 |pp=325\u2013328}}</ref>\n\nIn 1801, Outram resigned after work had stopped for a lengthy period.<ref name=\"skempton\">{{harvnb |Skempton |2002 |p=495}}</ref> Brown was  dismissed.<ref name = \"stan exp14\"/> In late 1804, a sub-committee visited [[Harecastle Tunnel]] on the [[Trent and Mersey Canal]], [[Butterley Tunnel]] on the [[Cromford Canal]] and the [[Norwood Tunnel]] on the [[Chesterfield Canal]]. It recommended that a towing path should be built through the tunnel but the extra cost and delay were not affordable. Desperately short of money, the canal company obtained a new Act of Parliament in 1806 to raise additional finance and allow an extra toll for using the tunnel.<ref name=\"hab328\">{{harvnb |Hadfield |Biddle |1970 |pp=328\u2013329}}</ref> In 1807, [[Thomas Telford]] was asked for his advice.

Before [[Local Government Act 1972|boundary changes in 1974]], both ends of the tunnel were in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]]. Three are [[Rail transport|railway]] tunnels and the other is a [[canal]] tunnel.\n\nThe canal tunnel on the [[Huddersfield Narrow Canal]] was authorised by an [[Act of Parliament]] on 4 April 1794. Construction of a {{convert|5451|yd|m|adj=on}}-long tunnel began months later.<ref name=\"Ellis 2017 105\">{{harvnb|Ellis|2017|p=105}}</ref> Within two years, cost-saving measures pushed back its completion date and progress was slowed by the high levels of water which were much greater than had been expected. It proved difficult to secure skilled help, some tenders went unanswered and [[Benjamin Outram]] withdrew from the venture. In 1807, [[Thomas Telford]] drew up a new plan for its completion. In 1811, the tunnel opened. It is the longest and oldest of the four Standedge tunnels and is the longest and highest canal tunnel in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.standedge.co.uk/about.htm|title=Transportation Uses - Standedge Tunnels|work=standedge.co.uk|accessdate=4 September 2010}}</ref> Having been closed to all traffic in 1943, the canal tunnel was re-opened in May 2001.\n\nThe first, single-track railway tunnel, built for the [[London and North Western Railway]] (LNWR) on its line between Huddersfield and Manchester, was completed in 1848. It proved to have insufficient capacity and a second, parallel, single-track tunnel was opened in 1871. The LNWR opened a third, double-track tunnel in 1894. All four tunnels are linked by cross-tunnels or [[adit]]s at strategic intervals, which allowed the railway tunnels to be built without construction shafts, and allowed waste material to be removed by boat. Only the double-track tunnel is currently used for rail traffic. The others are intact but disused. The Standedge Tunnel Visitor Centre at the Marsden end, is a base for boat trips into the tunnel and has an exhibition depicting the different crossings.\n\n==Canal tunnel==\n{{Standedge Tunnel map}}\n[[File:Standedge canal tunnel - geograph.org.uk - 1410632.jpg|right|thumb|Inside the canal tunnel]]\n\n===Construction===\nOn 4 April 1794, construction of the ''Huddersfield Narrow Canal'' (then known as the ''Huddersfield Canal''), linking [[Ashton-under-Lyne]] and [[Huddersfield]] via a tunnel was authorised by an [[Act of Parliament]].<ref name = \"stan exp14\"/> [[Benjamin Outram]] was appointed  the consulting engineer after his report in October 1793 estimated the cost of the canal and tunnel at \u00a3178,478. Nicholas Brown surveyed the route. Outram thought that geology of the hill through which the tunnel would pass was of [[gritstone]] and shale, and not present any difficulties. Work on the {{convert|5456|yd|m|adj=on}} tunnel would start at a dip in the hill at Red Brook and the tunnel would be driven simultaneously from both ends. [[Steam engine]]s would keep the works drained during construction.<ref>{{harvnb |Hadfield |Biddle |1970 |pp=322\u2013323}}</ref>\n\nOutram was the site engineer and Brown was superintendent and surveyor. During July 1795, John Evans was appointed to manage boring the tunnel. By mid-1796, {{convert|795|yd|m}} of tunnel had been cut, some of which had been lined. Considerable effort had been spent constructing small tunnels to supply waterwheels to raise spoil and water from intermediate [[adit]]s.<ref name = \"stan exp14\"/> By the autumn, concern that such work was expensive and Outram abandoned building extra workfaces and concentrated on boring out from both ends. Although cheaper, the completion date was extended.<ref name = \"had 3245\"/>\n\nOther factors had slowed progress; a shortage of funding and poor working practices also contributed.<ref name=\"stan exp14\">Bickerdike, Graeme.

In September 1797, Outram advised the committee that Thomas Lee, the contractor, had made large losses as a result of the difficulties and could not complete his contract. He was awarded more money for timber, an increased rate per yard for completion and an extra year in which to finish the tunnel.<ref name=\"had 3245\">{{harvnb |Hadfield |Biddle |1970 |pp=324\u2013325}}</ref>\n\nBy mid 1799, {{convert|1000|yd|m}} of the tunnel had been finished and {{convert|1000|yd|m}} had been excavated, but not completed. In October 1800, the [[Peak Forest Canal]] Company, who were keen to trade, suggested a tram road should be built to bypass the tunnel until it was completed but no action was taken. The next tunnel contract failed to attract any takers and canal engineer [[John Varley (canal engineer)|John Varley]], who had repaired parts of the canal which had been damaged by floods, was invited to work on the tunnel. Soon thereafter,  mine owner [[Matthew Fletcher (mine owner and engineer)|Matthew Fletcher]] was asked for his opinion; he suggested that time could be saved by tunnelling in both directions from Redbrook pit, which was kept dry by a large steam engine. He estimated that it would cost \u00a38,000 but a contractor could not be found and tunnelling continued from both ends.<ref>{{harvnb |Hadfield |Biddle |1970 |pp=325\u2013328}}</ref>\n\nIn 1801, Outram resigned after work had stopped for a lengthy period.<ref name=\"skempton\">{{harvnb |Skempton |2002 |p=495}}</ref> Brown was  dismissed.<ref name = \"stan exp14\"/> In late 1804, a sub-committee visited [[Harecastle Tunnel]] on the [[Trent and Mersey Canal]], [[Butterley Tunnel]] on the [[Cromford Canal]] and the [[Norwood Tunnel]] on the [[Chesterfield Canal]]. It recommended that a towing path should be built through the tunnel but the extra cost and delay were not affordable. Desperately short of money, the canal company obtained a new Act of Parliament in 1806 to raise additional finance and allow an extra toll for using the tunnel.<ref name=\"hab328\">{{harvnb |Hadfield |Biddle |1970 |pp=328\u2013329}}</ref> In 1807, [[Thomas Telford]] was asked for his advice.

The tunnel had cost \u00a3160,000, making it the most expensive canal tunnel to have been built in Britain.<ref name=hab328/> It was also the longest, deepest and highest.

Despite multiple problems,  its construction showed that the technique of quantity surveying had advanced. Telford's plan covered every eventuality and  was followed until the canal opened. Between 1811 and 1840, the tunnel was used on average by 40 boats daily.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Saddleworth Story|first=Mary|last=Hodge|page=19|edition=5th reprint|year=1994|url=http://www.saddleworth-historical-society.org.uk/bibliography.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811073652/http://www.saddleworth-historical-society.org.uk/bibliography.htm|archive-date=11 August 2007}}</ref> The tunnel is brick-lined in some places, though some sections of bare rock were left exposed.<ref name=\"Pennine_Waterways\">{{cite web|url=http://www.penninewaterways.co.uk/huddersfield/standedge3.htm|website=Pennine Waterways|title=Standedge Tunnel History|accessdate=26 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe tunnel is only wide enough for one [[narrowboat]] for much of its length and to save on cost, a [[towpath|tow-path]] was not provided.

The canal company introduced one way working, for which one end of the tunnel was closed by a locked chain to prevent access unless authorised. A similar arrangement remains in use.<ref name = Pennine_Waterways/>\n\nIn 1846, the Huddersfield Narrow Canal was purchased by the [[London and North Western Railway#Acquisitio|Huddersfield & Manchester Railway]].

'''Fire/smoke dampers''' are similar to fire dampers in fire resistance rating, and also prevent the spread of smoke inside the ducts. When a rise in temperature occurs, the '''fire damper''' closes, usually activated by a thermal element which melts at temperatures higher than ambient but low enough to indicate the presence of a fire, allowing springs to close the damper blades. Fire dampers can also close following receipt of an electrical signal from a fire alarm system utilising detectors remote from the damper, indicating the sensing of heat or smoke in the building occupied spaces or in the HVAC duct system.\n\nRegulations and [[fire test]] regimes vary from one country to another, which can result in different designs and applications.\n\n==Fire dampers for ducts==\n\n===Mechanical dampers===\n<gallery>\nImage:Deutsche_fsk_nicht_ami_bloedsinn.png|German fire damper in underground parking of a commercial building. Unlike its North American contemporaries, this damper addresses smoke migration through the damper's annulus.\nImage:Fire and smoke dampers 1 of 3.jpg|North American fire dampers, ready for installation in Durasteel [[Fire-resistance rating|fire-resistance rated]] [[pressurisation ductwork]].\nImage:Fire and smoke dampers 2 of 3.jpg|Side view of [[North America]]n fire damper, showing the closing mechanism that shuts the interior blades. An air gap of maximum 1/8\" per linear foot of width facilitate installation and allows smoke migration through the assembly. European dampers conceal this mechanism, with exterior [[mortar (firestop)|firestop mortar]] acting as both a [[heatsink]] and smoke seal.\nImage:FireDamper.png|European fire damper with interior fire-resisting board.\nImage:Fire damper clusterf.jpg|Fire damper in oversized hole in a 2-hour rated [[concrete]] slab. The annulus permits smoke migration.\n</gallery>\nMechanical dampers shut the cross sectional area of a duct in the event of a fire either by means of pivoting a fire-resistant board (in Europe), or by means of steel shutters, similar to blinds on a window (in North America). In the European designs, the turning mechanism is fully contained, permitting the dampers (subject to type approval) to be grouted in place, which permits a heat sink effect to conduct heat from an accidental building fire, which impinges upon a duct and damper, to be conducted into surrounding structures. This also addresses the topic of smoke migration through the damper's annulus. In North American damper designs, the closing mechanism for the interior shutters resides on the outside of the damper, which is why NFPA 80 expressly prohibits the installation or presence of any materials in the damper's annulus, which are not mentioned in the manufacturer's instructions, which are governed by their [[certification listing]]s. The closing mechanism must be allowed to operate, which necessitates that the annulus remain open, apart from an angle iron lip that surrounds the damper through-penetration in fire-resistance rated wall and floor assemblies. Maintenance efforts of mechanical dampers of both European and North American mechanical damper designs focus on the function of the mechanical shutting of the opening (which must be performed during inspection), as well as removal of any foreign objects that may otherwise impair this function.\n\n===Intumescent dampers===\n<gallery>\nImage:Square_intumescent_damper.jpg|Intumescent damper insert. Openings in the unit swell shut as a result of intumescence in case of fire or heat exposure.\nImage:Round_intumescent_damper.jpg|Round intumescent damper insert.\n</gallery>\nIntumescent dampers may be qualified to ISO 10294-5:2005 Fire dampers for air distribution systems\u2014Part 5: Intumescent fire dampers. They swell shut due to [[intumescent|intumescence]] in the event of a fire. Unlike mechanical dampers, it is a [[Physical chemistry|physical/chemical reaction]] that causes the closure to work. Provided the intumescent is within demonstrable ageing and/or shelf life and providing the absence of massive combustible objects (sabotage), the damper is certified to maintain its functionality subject to its certification listing or type approval. In other words, cleaning (when necessary) and an age assessment comprise the inspection. The annulus of an intumescent damper is shut as per its certification listing, such that the intumescent can press against a shut frame to close the opening, thus eliminating annular smoke migration. Also, intumescent fire dampers can be qualified to ASTM E2912.<ref>[https://www.astm.org/Standards/E2912.htm ASTM E2912 Standard Test Method for Fire Test of Non-Mechanical Fire Dampers Used in Vented Construction]</ref> The purpose of such intumescent fire dampers is to prevent entry of airborne burning embers into buildings as a result of Wildlife Urban Interface Fires (WUI).<ref>[https://www.usfa.fema.gov/wui_toolkit/ US Fire Administration Page on its Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) toolkit]</ref>\n\n===PFP/AFP Hybrid===\nBoth mechanical and intumescent dampers form part of [[passive fire protection]] (PFP) systems, such as fire-resistance rated walls, floors, or even ducts or cable tray fireproofing. As such, they are PFP systems. However, whether an opening is mechanically closed or whether it is the physical/chemical action of an intumescent that does the work, the fact that they are activated by heat and then ''move'' to fulfill a fire safety function, also technically qualifies them to form part of [[active fire protection]] (AFP) systems.\n\n==Air transfer dampers==\nAir transfer fire dampers (ATFD) are not protected by ductwork and must therefore be installed and manufactured to standards and tests that take into account room fire exposures. Air transfer fire dampers are passive such as intumescent types or mechanical types. They are designed for fire resistance, direct flame resistance in the open state or for smoke resistance or for combinations. Some designs are for exterior use, some are for hygienic zone use and some are for Ex-zone applications.\n\nDepending on regional regulation, they are either tested to the same exposure as wall and floor building elements or tested slightly different such as for cable or pipe penetrations. In Europe, Sm or Sa classifications can be obtained for cold smoke resistance or cold and hot smoke resistance respectively. In the US, listing can be issued for use in wildfire exposure.\n\nContrary to dampers in ducts the closing time of ATFDs are crucial to avoid fire passing during the open state. For applications where direct flame penetration is not allowed through openings that are normally in open state, ATFDs must pass adequate standards. In the US, ASTM E2912 verify direct flame resistance in the open state and ASTM E119 for closed state.\n\n'''Air transfer fire dampers for walls or floors''' are usually designed for flush installation and comes in multiple sizes. Dampers are listed for vertical or horizontal installation or both and for one- or two-way fire exposure. Performance may be fire rated resistance as the compartment they serve, with or without smoke resistance. In Europe, the harmonized ETAG 026 Part 4 apply to classification of ATFDs.  \n<gallery>\nImage:Air transfer element.JPG|Fire element for air transfer dampers for walls\nImage:Air transfer damper mounted in wall.jpg|Air transfer damper mounted in wall\n</gallery>\n\n'''Air transfer fire dampers for doors''' are designed and tested for use in the lower part of door leaves and cannot be installed elsewhere or higher. In Europe, the fire door test EN 14600 and EN 1634-1 applies.\n\n'''Air transfer fire dampers in facades''' are vents applied in wall, eave soffit, gable or foundation. In the US, these are used to protect from exterior fire exposure from neighboring structure or via window-, arson- and wildfire (ASTM E2912 plus ASTM E119) or against wildfire only (ASTM E2886). In Europe, air transfer grilles for walls can be applied externally once a national assessment of suitability for the application in regards of embers, direct flame impingement, environmental impacts etc. has been done.\n\n'''Ventilating cavity fire barriers''' is a type of air transfer fire damper used in cavities or voids in constructions with natural ventilation, typically inside air gaps behind cladding. These are often subject to sudden direct flame impingement. In the US, ASTM E2912 cover testing, combined with E119 where required. A method to verify performance in the open state, similar to E2912, is being assessed in Europe by CEN.\n<gallery>\nImage:Cavity vent transparent.png|Cavity barrier with instant fire stop \nImage:Mounted cavity barrier.JPG|Cavity barrier invisible behind cladding\n</gallery>\n\n'''Dampers for ducts applied as air transfer dampers:''' Allowances exist for use of duct dampers as air transfer fire dampers. Since these typically will be too hot, and even allow penetration of flames to the unexposed side during fire, they must be modified and classified for such application. To achieve this they are tested with a grid on either side to prevent combustibles to be stored too close to hot parts or flaming. Some jurisdictions prescribe a general grid for use in front of listed duct dampers, which are not listed for use without ductwork.\n\n==Fire damper inspections and maintenance==\n[[Image:Cbc fire damper.jpg|thumb|left|Fire damper deficiency: The installed annular clearance around the damper violates the certification listing]]\n[[Image:Drywall reality.jpg|thumb|right|The damper's certification listing is violated because the damper shares the opening with other through-penetrants and the drywall fire-separation is not continuous.]]\nIn the US, the [[Joint Commission]], State Fire Marshals and Other Authorities Having Jurisdiction (AHJ's), require some Fire and Smoke Dampers to be tested at specified intervals. Similarly, European authorities mandate maintenance and repairs of fire dampers also, as part of approvals or listings issued following successful testing of fire damper assemblies.\n{{clear}}\n==See also==\n*[[Blast damper]]\n*[[HVAC]]\n*[[Passive fire protection]]\n*[[Active fire protection]]\n*[[Fire test]]\n*[[Listing and approval use and compliance]]\n*[[Sheet metal]]\n*[[Uniform Mechanical Code]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{HVAC}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20091005194111/http://www.ul.com/global/eng/pages/offerings/perspectives/regulator/electrical/additionalresources/dampers/ UL treatise on fire dampers]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20131213002022/http://ulstandardsinfonet.ul.com/scopes/scopes.asp?fn=0555.html Abstract on UL555 Standard on Fire Dampers]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20131213001617/http://www.ul.com/global/eng/pages/solutions/standards/accessstandards/catalogofstandards/standard/?id=555S_4 Abstract on UL555s Standard for Smoke Dampers]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20131213002105/http://ulstandardsinfonet.ul.com/scopes/scopes.asp?fn=0555c.html Abstract on UL555c Standard on Ceiling Dampers]\n*[http://www.ul.com/global/documents/offerings/perspectives/regulators/publications/Dampers_MG.pdf UL Marking and Application Guide for Dampers]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20131213003917/http://ulstandardsinfonet.ul.com/scopes/scopes.asp?fn=0033.html Abstract on UL33 Heat Responsive Links for Fire-Protection Service]\n*[http://www.astm.org/Standards/E2912.htm ASTM E2912 Standard Test Method for Fire Test of Non-Mechanical Fire Dampers Used in Vented Construction]\n*[http://www.astm.org/Standards/E2886.htm ASTM E2886 Access Portal: Standard Test Method for Evaluating the Ability of Exterior Vents to Resist the Entry of Embers and Direct Flame Impingement]\n*[http://www.nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/document-information-pages?mode=code&code=80 NFPA 80 Access Portal: Standard for Fire Doors and Other Opening Protectives]\n*[http://www.nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/document-information-pages?mode=code&code=90a NFPA 90A Access: Standard for the Installation of Air-Conditioning and Ventilating Systems]\n*[http://www.nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/document-information-pages?mode=code&code=105 NFPA 105 Access: Standard for the Installation of Smoke Door Assemblies and Other Opening Protectives]\n*[https://www.smacna.org/store/product/fire-smoke-and-radiation-damper-installation-guide-for-hvac SMACNA - Fire, Smoke, and Radiation Damper Installation Guide for HVAC (for purchase)]\n*[http://www.en-standard.eu/csn-en-14600-doorsets-and-openable-windows-with-fire-resisting-and-or-smoke-control-characteristics-requirements-and-classification/EN 14600 Access Portal: Doorsets and openable windows with fire resisting and/or smoke control characteristics - Requirements and classification]\n*[http://www.en-standard.eu/csn-en-1634-1-fire-resistance-and-smoke-control-tests-for-door-and-shutter-assemblies-openable-windows-and-elements-of-building-hardware-part-1-fire-resistance-test-for-door-and-shutter-assemblies-and-openable-windows/?gclid=CjwKEAjw9qafBRCRiYrL4-fpuFkSJACvocQ1HQF1pacGwD9g8EgAXEkdU4lYEgUBWiQcZdNs4eVBrxoC-Lzw_wcB EN 1634-1 Access Portal: Fire resistance and smoke control tests for door and shutter assemblies, openable windows and elements of building hardware - Part 1: Fire resistance test for door and shutter assemblies and openable windows]\n*[http://www.beuth.de/en/standard/din-en-15650/122643741 Abstract DIN EN 15650:2010-09 Ventilation for buildings - Fire dampers;

'''Fire/smoke dampers''' are similar to fire dampers in fire resistance rating, and also prevent the spread of smoke inside the ducts. When a rise in temperature occurs, the '''fire damper''' closes, usually activated by a thermal element which melts at temperatures higher than ambient but low enough to indicate the presence of a fire, allowing springs to close the damper blades. Fire dampers can also close following receipt of an electrical signal from a fire alarm system utilising detectors remote from the damper, indicating the sensing of heat or smoke in the building occupied spaces or in the HVAC duct system.\n\nRegulations and [[fire test]] regimes vary from one country to another, which can result in different designs and applications.\n\n==Fire dampers for ducts==\n\n===Mechanical dampers===\n<gallery>\nImage:Deutsche_fsk_nicht_ami_bloedsinn.png|German fire damper in underground parking of a commercial building. Unlike its North American contemporaries, this damper addresses smoke migration through the damper's annulus.\nImage:Fire and smoke dampers 1 of 3.jpg|North American fire dampers, ready for installation in Durasteel [[Fire-resistance rating|fire-resistance rated]] [[pressurisation ductwork]].\nImage:Fire and smoke dampers 2 of 3.jpg|Side view of [[North America]]n fire damper, showing the closing mechanism that shuts the interior blades. An air gap of maximum 1/8\" per linear foot of width facilitate installation and allows smoke migration through the assembly. European dampers conceal this mechanism, with exterior [[mortar (firestop)|firestop mortar]] acting as both a [[heatsink]] and smoke seal.\nImage:FireDamper.png|European fire damper with interior fire-resisting board.\nImage:Fire damper clusterf.jpg|Fire damper in oversized hole in a 2-hour rated [[concrete]] slab. The annulus permits smoke migration.\n</gallery>\nMechanical dampers shut the cross sectional area of a duct in the event of a fire either by means of pivoting a fire-resistant board (in Europe), or by means of steel shutters, similar to blinds on a window (in North America). In the European designs, the turning mechanism is fully contained, permitting the dampers (subject to type approval) to be grouted in place, which permits a heat sink effect to conduct heat from an accidental building fire, which impinges upon a duct and damper, to be conducted into surrounding structures. This also addresses the topic of smoke migration through the damper's annulus. In North American damper designs, the closing mechanism for the interior shutters resides on the outside of the damper, which is why NFPA 80 expressly prohibits the installation or presence of any materials in the damper's annulus, which are not mentioned in the manufacturer's instructions, which are governed by their [[certification listing]]s. The closing mechanism must be allowed to operate, which necessitates that the annulus remain open, apart from an angle iron lip that surrounds the damper through-penetration in fire-resistance rated wall and floor assemblies. Maintenance efforts of mechanical dampers of both European and North American mechanical damper designs focus on the function of the mechanical shutting of the opening (which must be performed during inspection), as well as removal of any foreign objects that may otherwise impair this function.\n\n===Intumescent dampers===\n<gallery>\nImage:Square_intumescent_damper.jpg|Intumescent damper insert. Openings in the unit swell shut as a result of intumescence in case of fire or heat exposure.\nImage:Round_intumescent_damper.jpg|Round intumescent damper insert.\n</gallery>\nIntumescent dampers may be qualified to ISO 10294-5:2005 Fire dampers for air distribution systems\u2014Part 5: Intumescent fire dampers. They swell shut due to [[intumescent|intumescence]] in the event of a fire. Unlike mechanical dampers, it is a [[Physical chemistry|physical/chemical reaction]] that causes the closure to work. Provided the intumescent is within demonstrable ageing and/or shelf life and providing the absence of massive combustible objects (sabotage), the damper is certified to maintain its functionality subject to its certification listing or type approval. In other words, cleaning (when necessary) and an age assessment comprise the inspection. The annulus of an intumescent damper is shut as per its certification listing, such that the intumescent can press against a shut frame to close the opening, thus eliminating annular smoke migration. Also, intumescent fire dampers can be qualified to ASTM E2912<ref>[https://www.astm.org/Standards/E2912.htm ASTM E2912 Standard Test Method for Fire Test of Non-Mechanical Fire Dampers Used in Vented Construction]</ref>. The purpose of such intumescent fire dampers is to prevent entry of airborne burning embers into buildings as a result of Wildlife Urban Interface Fires (WUI)<ref>[https://www.usfa.fema.gov/wui_toolkit/ US Fire Administration Page on its Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) toolkit]</ref>.\n\n===PFP/AFP Hybrid===\nBoth mechanical and intumescent dampers form part of [[passive fire protection]] (PFP) systems, such as fire-resistance rated walls, floors, or even ducts or cable tray fireproofing.

As a result, synthesis of fatty acids, TG and VLDL is reduced, whilst that of lipoprotein lipase, which catabolises TG, is enhanced. In addition, production of Apo A1 and ATP binding cassette A1 is up-regulated, leading to increased reverse cholesterol transport via HDL. Consequently, fibrates reduce TG by up to 50% and increase HDL-C by up to 20%, but LDL-C changes are variable.\nFewer large-scale trials have been conducted with fibrates than with statins and the results are less conclusive, but reduced rates of cardiovascular disease have been reported with fibrate therapy in the subgroup of patients with low HDL-C levels and elevated TG (e.g. TG > 2.3\u00a0mmol/L (200\u00a0mg/dL)). Fibrates are usually well tolerated but share a similar side-effect profile to statins. In addition, they may increase the risk of cholelithiasis and prolong the action of anticoagulants. Accumulating evidence suggests that they may also have a protective effect against diabetic microvascular complications.\n\nClinical trials do support their use as monotherapy agents. Fibrates reduce the number of non-fatal heart attacks, but do not improve all-cause mortality and are therefore indicated only in those not tolerant to statins.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Abourbih S, Filion KB, Joseph L, Schiffrin EL, Rinfret S, Poirier P, Pilote L, Genest J, Eisenberg MJ | display-authors = 6 | title = Effect of fibrates on lipid profiles and cardiovascular outcomes: a systematic review | journal = The American Journal of Medicine | volume = 122 | issue = 10 | pages = 962.e1\u20138 | date = October 2009 | pmid = 19698935 | doi = 10.1016/j.amjmed.2009.03.030 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Effects of fibrates on cardiovascular outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis |vauthors=Jun M, Foote C, Lv J, etal |journal=Lancet|volume=375|issue=9729|pages=1875&ndash;1884|year=2010|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60656-3|pmid=20462635 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jakob T, Nordmann AJ, Schandelmaier S, Ferreira-Gonz\u00e1lez I, Briel M | title = Fibrates for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease events | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 11 | pages = CD009753 | date = November 2016 | pmid = 27849333 | pmc = 6464497 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD009753.pub2 | editor-last = Cochrane Heart Group }}</ref>\n\nAlthough less effective in lowering [[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL]] levels, the ability of fibrates to increase HDL and lower [[triglyceride]] levels seems to reduce [[insulin resistance]] when the [[dyslipidemia]] is associated with other features of the [[metabolic syndrome]] ([[hypertension]] and [[diabetes mellitus type 2]]).<ref name=\"pmid15124979\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wysocki J, Belowski D, Kalina M, Kochanski L, Okopien B, Kalina Z | title = Effects of micronized fenofibrate on insulin resistance in patients with metabolic syndrome | journal = International Journal of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics | volume = 42 | issue = 4 | pages = 212\u20137 | date = April 2004 | pmid = 15124979 | doi = 10.5414/cpp42212 }}</ref> They are therefore used in many [[hyperlipidemias]]. Due to a rare paradoxical decrease in HDL-C seen in some patients on fenofibrate, as per US FDA label change, it is recommended that the HDL-C levels be checked within the first few months after initiation of fibrate therapy.  If a severely depressed HDL-C level is detected, fibrate therapy should be withdrawn, and the HDL-C level monitored until it has returned to baseline.

As a result, synthesis of fatty acids, TG and VLDL is reduced, whilst that of lipoprotein lipase, which catabolises TG, is enhanced. In addition, production of Apo A1 and ATP binding cassette A1 is up-regulated, leading to increased reverse cholesterol transport via HDL. Consequently, fibrates reduce TG by up to 50% and increase HDL-C by up to 20%, but LDL-C changes are variable.\nFewer large-scale trials have been conducted with fibrates than with statins and the results are less conclusive, but reduced rates of cardiovascular disease have been reported with fibrate therapy in the subgroup of patients with low HDL-C levels and elevated TG (e.g. TG > 2.3\u00a0mmol/L (200\u00a0mg/dL)). Fibrates are usually well tolerated but share a similar side-effect profile to statins. In addition, they may increase the risk of cholelithiasis and prolong the action of anticoagulants. Accumulating evidence suggests that they may also have a protective effect against diabetic microvascular complications.\n\nClinical trials do support their use as monotherapy agents.

By using the Primula as a test-bed, Fiat was able to sufficiently resolve the layout's disadvantages, including uneven side-to-side power transmission, uneven tire wear and potential [[torque steer]], the tendency for the power of the engine alone to steer the car under heavy acceleration.\n\nThe compact and efficient layout &mdash; a transversely-mounted engine with transmission mounted beside the engine driving the front wheels through an offset final-drive and unequal-length driveshafts &mdash; subsequently became common with competitors<ref name=\"lampredi\" /> and arguably an industry standard.<ref name=\"octane\">{{cite web |title=1969-1984 FIAT 128 Saloon |publisher=Classic and Performance Car |quote=It\u2019s the recipe for technical orthodoxy that has since been adopted by the entire industry. |url=http://www.classicandperformancecar.com/front_website/octane_interact/carspecs.php/?see=3994 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408211929/http://www.classicandperformancecar.com/front_website/octane_interact/carspecs.php/?see=3994 |archivedate=2014-04-08 }}</ref>\n\nThe layout was sufficiently flexible that Fiat reconfigured the 128 drive-train as a mid-engined layout for the [[Fiat X1/9]].\n\n==Design==\nThe all new 1.1 litre [[Fiat SOHC]] engine, engineered by noted engine designer [[Aurelio Lampredi]], featured an iron block mated to an aluminum head along with a belt-driven single overhead camshaft producing 49&nbsp;hp.<ref name=\"lampredi\">{{cite web |title=Collectible Classic: 1971-1979 Fiat 128 |publisher=Automobile Magazine, August 2012 |url=http://www.automobilemag.com/features/collectible_classic/1208_collectible_classic_1971_1979_fiat_128/}}</ref>\n\nThe 128 was styled similarly to the 124 and 125 and featured rack-and-pinion steering, front disc brakes, independent rear suspension with a transverse leaf spring, and a strut-type front suspension with integral anti-roll bar.<ref name=\"lampredi\" />\n\n[[File:Fiat 128-Mk2 Front-view.JPG|thumb|left|Second series (1976) Fiat 128 with new rectangular headlights]]\nInitially, the 128 was available as a two-door or four-door sedan. At the 1970 [[Turin Motor Show]] a three-door [[station wagon]] model called \"Familiare\" was added to the line-up.<ref name=\"AU71\" /> The car was only available with a 1116&nbsp;cc engine on launch, though the two-door-only 128 Rally edition launched in 1971 used a 1,290&nbsp;cc unit. Also in 1971, the Sport Coup\u00e9, an all-new coup\u00e9 body on a shortened 128 platform, was unveiled at the Turin Show. On launch it was available with both existing 128 engines.\n\nThe 128 range underwent a [[Facelift (automotive)|facelift]] in 1972, featuring a revised grille. 1974 saw the launch of the 128 Special, which used the Rally engine in a four-door sedan body. In 1975 the 128 3P (3-door) Berlinetta replaced the Sport Coup\u00e9. In 1976, the range received new bumpers, rectangular [[headlights]], tail lights and dashboard as well as modifications to the engines. At this time, the wagon was also renamed the \"Panorama\".\n\nProduction of all 128s except that of the base 1,100&nbsp;cc powered model ended in 1979 after the introduction of the [[Fiat Ritmo/Strada]] in 1978. In 1980 production of the small three-door station wagon Panorama was dropped from the range and 128 production finally ended in 1985.<ref name=Greats/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Road test==\nThe British \"[[The Motor (magazine)|Motor]]\" magazine tested a Fiat 128 in April 1970, shortly after its UK launch.  The car had a top speed of {{convert|85.4|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and accelerated from 0-{{convert|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in 15.5 seconds. An \"overall\" fuel consumption of {{convert|27.5|mpgimp|L/100 km mpgus}} was recorded.
