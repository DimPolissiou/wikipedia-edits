These small to medium-sized bottom-dwelling sharks are found mostly in, but are not limited to, the area around the southern seas of [[Australia (continent)|Australia]] and is commonly baited and fished for cuisine because of its taste and market prices. ======\n\n==Appearance==\nThis species is a slender, light-grey shark with white spots along the top and side of its body. The gummy shark gets its name from its flat, plate-like teeth which it uses to crush its shelled and non-shelled prey. The gummy shark can reach a maximum length of 157&nbsp;cm for males and 175&nbsp;cm for female.  The minimum size for both male and female is 45&nbsp;cm measured from the rear-most gill slit to the base of the tail fin. At birth, these sharks measure between 30 and 35&nbsp;cm.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.sharksmart.com.au/species/#81|title=Sharksmart - Keep enjoying the beach|work=Sharksmart|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en-au}}</ref>\n\n== <small> Hunting and Habitat</small> ==\nThe gummy shark feeds on [[crustacean]]s, marine worms, small fish, and [[cephalopod]]s such as octopus, squid and cuttlefish.<ref name=\":0\" />\n.

It is commercially sold and widely naturalized in Australia, and was introduced to South Africa, Chile, and Argentina. It is recognized as a potentially [[invasive species]] within the United States, although no indications of ill effects have been reported for this plant where it has been introduced outside of California. The golden poppy has been displaced in large areas of its original habitat, such as Southern California, by more invasive exotic species, such as mustard or annual grasses.\n\n====Chilean population====\nIn Chile, it was introduced from multiple sources between the mid-19th century and the early 20th century. It appears to have been both intentionally imported as an ornamental garden plant and accidentally introduced along with [[alfalfa]] seed grown in California. Since Chile and California have similar climatic regions and have experienced much agricultural exchange, it is perhaps not surprising that it was introduced to Chile. Once there, its perennial forms spread primarily in human-disturbed environments (Leger and Rice, 2003).\n\nThe introduced Chilean populations of California poppy appear to be larger and more [[fecund]] in their introduced range than in their native range (Leger and Rice, 2003). Introduced populations have been noted to be larger and more reproductively successful than native ones (Elton, 1958), and there has been much speculation as to why. An increase in resource availability, decreased competition, and release from enemy pressure have all been proposed as explanations.\n\nOne hypothesis is that the plant's resources devoted in the native range to a defense strategy can, in the absence of enemies, be devoted to increased growth and reproduction (the [[EICA Hypothesis]], Blossey & N\u00f6tzold, 1995).  However, this is not the case with introduced populations of ''E. californica'' in Chile: the Chilean populations were actually more resistant to Californian caterpillars than native populations (Leger and Forister, 2005).\n\n==State flower of California==\n[[File:MUTCD-CA G10B.svg|thumb|A Welcome to California road sign, featuring golden poppies]]\n[[File:California Scenic State.svg|thumb|left|220x130px|A [[State Scenic Highway System (California)|California Scenic Route]] marker showing the state flower]]\nDuring the 1890s [[Sara Plummer Lemmon|Sarah Plummer Lemmon]] advocated for the adoption of the golden poppy as the state flower of [[California]], eventually writing the bill passed by the California Legislature and signed by [[George Pardee|Governor George Pardee]] in 1903.<ref name=\"findagrave\">[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/21712917 \"Sara Allen Plummer Lemmon (1836\u20131923)\"], ''Find-a-Grave''.</ref><ref name=\"redmon\">Michael Redmon, [http://www.independent.com/news/2008/apr/10/who-responsible-setting-santa-barbaras-first-libra/ \"Who is responsible for setting up Santa Barbara\u2019s first library?\"], ''Santa Barbara Independent'', April 10, 2008.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.californiabeat.org/2009/05/27/california-beat-hero-sara-plummer-lemmon|title=California Beat Hero: Sara Plummer Lemmon|date=May 27, 2009|website=California Beat|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223053357/http://www.californiabeat.org/2009/05/27/california-beat-hero-sara-plummer-lemmon|archive-date=December 23, 2010|url-status=|access-date=2016-12-13}}</ref>\n\nIt was selected as the state flower by the California State Floral Society in December 1890, besting the [[Mariposa lily]] (genus ''[[Calochortus]]'') and the [[Romneya|Matilija poppy]] (''[[Romneya coulteri]]'') by a wide margin, but the state legislature did not make the selection official until 1903.

It is commercially sold and widely naturalized in Australia, and was introduced to South Africa, Chile, and Argentina. It is recognized as a potentially [[invasive species]] within the United States, although no indications of ill effects have been reported for this plant where it has been introduced outside of California. The golden poppy has been displaced in large areas of its original habitat, such as Southern California, by more invasive exotic species, such as mustard or annual grasses.\n\n====Chilean population====\nIn Chile, it was introduced from multiple sources between the mid-19th century and the early 20th century. It appears to have been both intentionally imported as an ornamental garden plant and accidentally introduced along with [[alfalfa]] seed grown in California. Since Chile and California have similar climatic regions and have experienced much agricultural exchange, it is perhaps not surprising that it was introduced to Chile. Once there, its perennial forms spread primarily in human-disturbed environments (Leger and Rice, 2003).\n\nThe introduced Chilean populations of California poppy appear to be larger and more [[fecund]] in their introduced range than in their native range (Leger and Rice, 2003). Introduced populations have been noted to be larger and more reproductively successful than native ones (Elton, 1958), and there has been much speculation as to why. An increase in resource availability, decreased competition, and release from enemy pressure have all been proposed as explanations.\n\nOne hypothesis is that the plant's resources devoted in the native range to a defense strategy can, in the absence of enemies, be devoted to increased growth and reproduction (the [[EICA Hypothesis]], Blossey & N\u00f6tzold, 1995).  However, this is not the case with introduced populations of ''E. californica'' in Chile: the Chilean populations were actually more resistant to Californian caterpillars than native populations (Leger and Forister, 2005).\n\n==State flower of California==\n[[File:MUTCD-CA G10B.svg|thumb|A Welcome to California road sign, featuring golden poppies]]\n[[File:California Scenic State.svg|thumb|left|220x130px|A [[State Scenic Highway System (California)|California Scenic Route]] marker showing the state flower]]\nDuring the 1890s [[Sara Plummer Lemmon|Sarah Plummer Lemmon]] advocated for the adoption of the golden poppy as the state flower of [[California]], eventually writing the bill passed by the California Legislature and signed by [[George Pardee|Governor George Pardee]] in 1903.<ref name=\"findagrave\">[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/21712917 \"Sara Allen Plummer Lemmon (1836\u20131923)\"], ''Find-a-Grave''.</ref><ref name=\"redmon\">Michael Redmon, [http://www.independent.com/news/2008/apr/10/who-responsible-setting-santa-barbaras-first-libra/ \"Who is responsible for setting up Santa Barbara\u2019s first library?\"], ''Santa Barbara Independent'', April 10, 2008.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.californiabeat.org/2009/05/27/california-beat-hero-sara-plummer-lemmon|title=California Beat Hero: Sara Plummer Lemmon|date=May 27, 2009|website=California Beat|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223053357/http://www.californiabeat.org/2009/05/27/california-beat-hero-sara-plummer-lemmon|archive-date=December 23, 2010|url-status=|access-date=2016-12-13}}</ref>\n\nIt was selected as the state flower by the California State Floral Society in December 1890, besting the [[Mariposa lily]] (genus ''[[Calochortus]]'') and the [[Romneya|Matilija poppy]] (''[[Romneya coulteri]]'') by a wide margin, but the state legislature did not make the selection official until 1903.
