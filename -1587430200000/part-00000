{"title_page": "Intrinsic motivation (artificial intelligence)", "text_new": "''Intrinsic motivation'' in the study of [[artificial intelligence]] is a mechanism for enabling [[artificial agent]]s to exhibit inherently rewarding behaviours such as exploration and curiosity, grouped under the [[intrinsic motivation|same term]] in the study of [[psychology]]. Psychologists consider intrinsic motivation in humans to be the drive to perform an activity for inherent satisfaction - just for the fun or challenge of it.<ref name=ryan2000></ref>\n\n== Definition ==\nAn [[intelligent agent]] is intrinsically motivated to act if the information content alone, of the experience resulting from the action, is the motivating factor. Information content in this context is measured in the [[information theory|information-theoretic]] sense of quantifying uncertainty. A typical intrinsic motivation is to search for unusual, surprising situations (exploration), in contrast to a typical extrinsic motivation such as the search for food (homeostasis).<ref name=\"oudeyer2008\"></ref>.\n\n==Origins in Psychology==\n\nThe study of intrinsic motivation in psychology and neuroscience began in the 1950s with some psychologists explaining exploration through \"drives\", however this homeostatic view was criticised by White<ref name=white1959></ref>. An alternative explanation from [[Daniel Berlyne|Berlyne]] in 1960 was the pursuit of an optimal balance between novelty and familiarity<ref name=Berlyne1960></ref>). [[Leon Festinger|Festinger]] described the the difference between internal and external view of the world as dissonance that organisms are motivated to reduce<ref name=festinger1957></ref>. As similar view was expressed in the 70's by Kagan as the desire to reduce the incompatibility between cognitive structure and experience<ref name=\"kagan1972\"></ref>. In contrast to the idea of optimal incongruity, [[Edward L. Deci|Deci]] and [[Richard M. Ryan|Ryan]] identified in the mid 80's an intrinsic motivation based on competence and self-determination<ref name=deci1985></ref>.\n\n==Computational models==\n\nAn influential early computational approach to implement artificial curiosity in the early 1990s by [[J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber|Schmidhuber]], has since been developed into a \"Formal theory of creativity, fun, and intrinsic motivation\u201d<ref name=schmidhuber2010></ref>. \n\nIntrinsic motivation is often studied in the framework of [[reinforcement learning]]<ref name=barto2004></ref> (introduced by [[Richard Sutton|Sutton]] and [[Andrew Barto|Barto]]), where the rewards that drive agent behaviour are intrinsically derived rather than externally imposed<ref name=barto2012></ref>. Various other computational approaches to intrinsic motivation have been attempted including [[Luc Steels|Steels']] autotelic principle <ref name=steels2004></ref> \n \nIn a 2007 review of approaches to modelling intrinsic motivation in artificial intelligence, [[Pierre-Yves Oudeyer|Ouedeyer]] and Kaplan define intrinsic motivation based on Berlyne's theory, and divide approaches to the implementation of intrinsic motivation into three categories that broadly follow the roots in psychology: knowledge based models, competence based models and morphological models<ref name=oudeyer2008></ref>. In 2013 Baldassare and Mirolli further differentiate knowledge based models into prediction based and novelty based<ref name=baldassarre2013></ref>.\n\nThe quantification of prediction and novelty to drive behaviour is generally enabled through the application of information-theoretic models, where agent state and strategy (policy) over time are represented by probability distributions describing a [[markov decision process]] and the [[Motor_cognition#Perception-action_coupling|cycle of perception and action]] treated as an information channel. These approaches claim biological feasibility as part of a family of [[bayesian approaches to brain function]]. The main criticism and difficulty of these models is the intractability of computing probability distributions over large discrete or continuous state spaces<ref name=oudeyer2008></ref>. Nonetheless a considerable body of work has built up modelling intrinsic motivation as the flow of information through the sensorimotor channel including most notably [[active inference]]<ref name=friston2006></ref>, but also ''predictive information''<ref name=ay2008></ref> and ''empowerment''<ref name=salge2014></ref>.\n\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=ryan2000>{{cite journal\n|last1=Ryan\n|first1=Richard M\n|last2=Deci\n|first2=Edward L\n|date=2000\n|title=Intrinsic and extrinsic motivations: Classic definitions and new directions\n|journal=Contemporary educational psychology\n|volume=25\n|issue=1\n|pages=54--67}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"oudeyer2008\">{{cite book\n|last1=Oudeyer\n|first1=Pierre-Yves\n|last2=Kaplan\n|first2=Frederic\n|date=2008\n|chapter=How can we define intrinsic motivation?\n|title=Proc. of the 8th Conf. on Epigenetic Robotics\n|volume=5\n|pages=29--31}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=baldassarre2013>{{cite book |last1=Baldassarre |first1=Gianluca |last2=Mirolli |first2=Marco |title=Intrinsically Motivated Learning in Natural 1 and Artificial Systems |date=2013 |publisher=Springer |location=Rome, Italy |pages=1-14 |chapter=Intrinsically Motivated Learning Systems: An Overview}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"schmidhuber2010\">{{cite journal |last1=Schmidhuber |first1=J |title=Formal theory of creativity, fun, and intrinsic motivation (1990-2010) |journal=IEEE Trans.

It was created by Laura Gibson and developed by Charlie Bennett. The sshow is so fake. It's almost funny. The show consisted of eight episodes, all of which were released on 17 April 2020 on [[Netflix]]. The host of the series is a [[virtual assistant]], named \"Lana\", who will give the cast the rules they must follow for the season; [[Desiree Burch]] provided voice-over narration. The premise of the show is to teach young, single people to create genuine connections instead of their usual [[One-night stand|flings]]. If contestants engage in any sexual contact on the island, then the prize money would decrease, starting at {{USD|100000|long=no}}.\n\nOn finale night, Bryce Hirschberg, Chloe Veitch, David Birtwistle, Francesca Farago, Harry Jowsey, Kelz Dyke, Lydia Clyma, Nicole O'Brien, Rhonda Paul, and [https://maniabets.com/sharron-townsend/ Sharron Townsend] were all deemed the winners of ''Too Hot to Handle'' and split the {{USD|75000|long=no}} prize.\n\n== Format ==\nThe series will follow the original group of ten singles as they are taken to a special island villa for four weeks to find love and {{USD|100000|long=no}}. However, twelve hours into the retreat, the contestants are informed by a [[virtual assistant]], Lana,<ref name=\"ENews\">{{cite web |last1=Harnick |first1=Chris |title=Too Hot to Handle Tasks Horny Contestants With Keeping Their Hands to Themselves for Money |url=https://www.eonline.com/news/1139399/too-hot-to-handle-tasks-horny-contestants-with-keeping-their-hands-to-themselves-for-money |website=eonline.com |publisher=ENews |accessdate=10 April 2020 |date=10 April 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> that they [[Sexual abstinence|cannot do anything sexual]], such as kissing, [[Sexual intercourse|sex]], or [[Masturbation|masturbating]].

Once the light turned on, the rules of the retreat were void for the contestant and they were able to explore their connection further. If their connection was strong enough, they were able to have a night at the private suite, but their lights would not turn on during the night, so they still needed to follow the rules.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Two's Company, Three's a ...

If they were to spend the entire night with no contact, the amount of money they cost from the prize fund was added back. Before the prize fund was allocated, several contestants were eliminated since they failed to seek personal growth. At the allocation ceremony, the remaining contestants all split the prize money since they all experienced personal growth in their dating life.\n\nSeveral publications have compared the format of ''Too Hot to Handle'' to that of ''[[Love Island (franchise)|Love Island]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Curto |first1=Justin |title=Netflix\u2019s Too Hot to Handle Will Fill the Love Is Blind\u2013Size Hole in Your Life |url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/04/too-hot-to-handle-trailer-netflix.html |website=vulture.com |publisher=Vulture |accessdate=10 April 2020 |date=10 April 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Baty |first1=Emma |title=Netflix Just Made Their Own Version of 'Love Island,' but the Contestants Can\u2019t Hook Up With Each Other |url=https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/tv/a32109096/netflix-too-hot-to-handle-trailer/ |website=cosmopolitan.com |publisher=Cosmopolitan |accessdate=10 April 2020 |date=10 April 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Cast ==\nThe cast was revealed on ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' on 10 April 2020.<ref name=\"cast\">{{cite web |last1=Murphy |first1=Desiree |title='Too Hot to Handle': Meet the Cast of Your Next Netflix Quarantine Obsession |url=https://www.etonline.com/too-hot-to-handle-meet-the-cast-of-your-next-netflix-quarantine-obsession-144404 |website=etonline.com |publisher=Entertainment Tonight |accessdate=10 April 2020 |date=10 April 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

The host of the series is a [[virtual assistant]], named \"Lana\", who will give the cast the rules they must follow for the season; [[Desiree Burch]] provided voice-over narration. The premise of the show is to teach young, single people to create genuine connections instead of their usual [[One-night stand|flings]]. If contestants engage in any sexual contact on the island, then the prize money would decrease, starting at {{USD|100000|long=no}}.\n\nOn finale night, Bryce Hirschberg, Chloe Veitch, David Birtwistle, Francesca Farago, Harry Jowsey, Kelz Dyke, Lydia Clyma, Nicole O'Brien, Rhonda Paul, and [https://maniabets.com/sharron-townsend/ Sharron Townsend] were all deemed the winners of ''Too Hot to Handle'' and split the {{USD|75000|long=no}} prize.\n\n== Format ==\nThe series will follow the original group of ten singles as they are taken to a special island villa for four weeks to find love and {{USD|100000|long=no}}.

Once the light turned on, the rules of the retreat were void for the contestant and they were able to explore their connection further. If their connection was strong enough, they were able to have a night at the private suite, but their lights would not turn on during the night, so they still needed to follow the rules.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Two's Company, Three's a ...

If they were to spend the entire night with no contact, the amount of money they cost from the prize fund was added back. Before the prize fund was allocated, several contestants were eliminated since they failed to seek personal growth.
