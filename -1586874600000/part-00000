As in the [[Sino-Soviet conflict (1929)|Sino-Soviet conflict]] on the [[Chinese Eastern Railway]] or [[Soviet\u2013Japanese Border Wars|Soviet\u2013Japanese border conflicts]], Soviet troops on the western border received a directive, signed by [[Marshal of the Soviet Union|Marshal]] [[Semyon Timoshenko]] and [[Army General (Soviet rank)|General of the Army]] [[Georgy Zhukov]], that ordered (as demanded by Stalin): \"do not answer to any provocations\" and \"do not undertake any (offensive) actions without specific orders\" \u2013 which meant that Soviet troops could open fire only on their soil and forbade counter-attack on German soil. The German invasion therefore caught the Soviet military and civilian leadership largely by surprise.\n\nThe extent of warnings received by Stalin about a German invasion is controversial, and the claim that there was a warning that \"Germany will attack on 22 June without declaration of war\" has been dismissed as a \"popular myth\". However, some sources quoted in the articles on Soviet spies [[Richard Sorge]] and [[Willi Lehmann]], say they had sent warnings of an attack on 20 or 22 June, which were treated as \"disinformation\". The [[Lucy spy ring]] in Switzerland also sent warnings, possibly deriving from Ultra codebreaking in Britain.\n\nSoviet intelligence was fooled by German disinformation, so sent false alarms to Moscow about a German invasion in April, May and the beginning of June. Soviet intelligence reported that Germany would rather invade the USSR after the fall of the British Empire<ref>Source: L. E. Reshin, \"Year of 1941\", vol. 1, p. 508.</ref> or after an unacceptable ultimatum demanding German occupation of Ukraine during the German invasion of Britain.<ref>Source: L. E.

In addition to Germany, hundreds of thousands of tons of bombs were dropped on their eastern allies of [[Bombing of Romania in World War II|Romania]] and [[Strategic bombing during World War II#Allied bombing statistics 1939\u201345|Hungary]], [[Operation Tidal Wave|primarily in an attempt to cripple Romanian oil production]].\n\nBritish and Commonwealth forces also contributed directly to the fighting on the Eastern Front through their service in the [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Arctic convoys]] and [[No. 151 Wing RAF|training Red Air Force pilots]], as well as in the provision of early material and intelligence support.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|+Allied shipments to the Soviet Union<ref>Hans-Adolf Jacobsen: ''1939\u20131945, Der Zweite Weltkrieg in Chronik und Dokumenten''.

However, access to (and control of) the [[resource]]s, raw materials and production capacity required to entertain long-term goals (such as European control, German territorial expansion and the destruction of the USSR) were limited. Political demands necessitated the expansion of Germany's control of natural and human resources, industrial capacity and farmland beyond its borders (conquered territories). Germany's military production was tied to resources outside its area of control, a dynamic not found amongst the Allies.\n\nDuring the war, as Germany acquired new territories (either by direct annexation or by installing puppet governments in defeated countries), these new territories were forced to sell raw materials and agricultural products to German buyers at extremely low prices. Two-thirds of all French trains in 1941 were used to carry goods to Germany. [[Norway]] lost 20% of its national income in 1940 and 40% in 1943.{{sfn|Braun|1990|p=121}} Axis allies such as [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], [[Finland]], [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatia]] and [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] benefited from Germany's net imports. Overall, [[Vichy France|France]] made the largest contribution to the German war effort. In 1943\u201344, French payments to Germany may have risen to as much as 55% of French GDP.<ref>[https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-history-of-the-second-world-war/economics-of-the-war-with-nazi-germany/E2F3FE2B9549A00F2E992673C5C8B28D/core-reader The economics of the war with Nazi Germany]</ref> Overall, Germany imported 20% of its food and 33% of its raw materials from conquered territories and Axis allies.<ref>https://www.bbc.com/bitesize/guides/z2932p3/revision/4</ref>\n\nOn 27 May 1940, Germany signed the \"Oil Pact\" with Romania, by which Germany would trade arms for oil. Romania's oil production amounted to approximately 6,000,000 tons annually. This production represents 35% of the total fuel production of the Axis including the synthetic products and the substitutes and 70% of the total production of crude oil.<ref>A History of Romanian Oil, Vol. II, p. 245</ref> In 1941, Germany only had 18% of the oil it had in peacetime. Romania supplied Germany and its allies with roughly 13 million barrels of oil (about 4 million per year) between 1941 and 1943.

A Soviet [[Paratrooper|parachute drop]] by two battalions of the 201st Airborne Brigade and the 250th Airborne Regiment on 18 and 22 January was designed to \"cut off enemy communications with the rear.\" Lt.-Gen. [[Mikhail Grigoryevich Yefremov]]'s 33rd Army aided by Gen. Belov's 1st Cavalry Corps and [[Soviet Partisans]] attempted to seize Vyazma. This force was joined by additional paratroopers of the 8th Airborne Brigade at the end of January. However, in early February, the Germans managed to cut off this force, separating the Soviets from their main force in the rear of the Germans. They were supplied by air until April when they were given permission to regain the Soviet main lines. Only part of Belov's Cavalry Corps made it to safety however, while Yefremov's men fought \"a losing battle.\"<ref name=GeorgyZhukov/>{{rp|59\u201362}}\n\nBy April 1942, the Soviet Supreme Command agreed to assume the defensive so as to \"consolidate the captured ground.\" According to Zhukov, ''\"During the winter offensive, the forces of the Western Front had advanced from 70 to 100&nbsp;km, which somewhat improved the overall operational and strategic situation on the Western sector.\"''<ref name=GeorgyZhukov/>{{rp|64}}\n\nTo the north, the Red Army surrounded a German [[garrison]] in [[Demyansk]], which held out with air supply for four months, and established themselves in front of [[Kholm, Kholmsky District, Novgorod Oblast|Kholm]], [[Velizh]], and [[Velikie Luki]].\n\nFurther north still, the Soviet Second Shock Army was unleashed on the [[Volkhov River]]. Initially this made some progress; however, it was unsupported, and by June a German counterattack cut off and destroyed the army. The Soviet commander, Lieutenant General [[Andrey Vlasov]], later defected to Germany and formed the ROA or [[Russian Liberation Army]].\n\nIn the south the Red Army lunged over the [[Donets River]] at [[Izyum]] and drove a {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} deep salient. The intent was to pin Army Group South against the [[Sea of Azov]], but as the winter eased the Wehrmacht counter-attacked and cut off the over-extended Soviet troops in the [[Second Battle of Kharkov]].\n\n===Don, Volga, and Caucasus: Summer 1942===\n{{Main|Case Blue|Battle of Voronezh (1942)|Battle of Caucasus|Battle of Stalingrad}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}\n[[File:Eastern Front 1942-05 to 1942-11.png|thumb|[[Operation Blue]]: German advances from 7 May 1942 to 18 November 1942:\n{{legend|#fff8d5|to 7 July 1942}}\n{{legend|#ffd2b9|to 22 July 1942}}\n{{legend|#ebd7ff|to 1 August 1942}}\n{{legend|#ccffcd|to 18 November 1942}}]]\n\nAlthough plans were made to attack Moscow again, on 28 June 1942, the offensive re-opened in a different direction. Army Group South took the initiative, anchoring the front with the [[Battle of Voronezh (1942)|Battle of Voronezh]] and then following the [[Don River, Russia|Don river]] southeastwards. The grand plan was to secure the Don and [[Volga]] first and then drive into the Caucasus towards [[Petroleum industry in Azerbaijan|the oil fields]], but operational considerations and Hitler's vanity made him order both objectives to be attempted simultaneously. Rostov was recaptured on 24 July when the 1st Panzer Army joined in, and then that group drove south towards [[Maykop|Maikop]]. As part of this, Operation ''Shamil'' was executed, a plan whereby a group of [[Brandenburger commando]]s dressed up as Soviet [[NKVD]] troops to destabilise Maikop's defences and allow the 1st Panzer Army to enter the oil town with little opposition.\n\nMeanwhile, the 6th Army was driving towards [[Stalingrad]], for a long period unsupported by 4th Panzer Army, which had been diverted to help 1st Panzer Army cross the Don. By the time the 4th Panzer Army had rejoined the Stalingrad offensive Soviet resistance (comprising the 62nd Army under [[Vasily Chuikov]]) had stiffened. A leap across the Don brought German troops to the Volga on 23 August but for the next three months the ''Wehrmacht'' would be fighting the Battle of Stalingrad street-by-street.\n\nTowards the south, the 1st Panzer Army had reached the Caucasian foothills and the [[Malka River]]. At the end of August Romanian mountain troops joined the Caucasian spearhead, while the Romanian 3rd and 4th armies were redeployed from their successful task of clearing the Azov [[littoral]]. They took up position on either side of Stalingrad to free German troops for the main offensive. Mindful of the continuing antagonism between Axis allies Romania and [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] over [[Transylvania]], the Romanian army in the Don bend was separated from the Hungarian 2nd army by the Italian 8th Army. Thus, all of Hitler's allies were involved \u2013 including a [[Slovak Republic (1939\u20131945)|Slovakian]] contingent with the 1st Panzer Army and a [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatian]] [[regiment]] attached to 6th Army.\n\nThe advance into the Caucasus bogged down, with the Germans unable to fight their way past [[Malgobek]] and to the main prize of [[Grozny]]. Instead, they switched the direction of their advance to approach it from the south, crossing the Malka at the end of October and entering [[North Ossetia\u2013Alania|North Ossetia]]. In the first week of November, on the outskirts of [[Vladikavkaz|Ordzhonikidze]], the 13th Panzer Division's spearhead was snipped off and the panzer troops had to fall back. The offensive into Russia was over.\n\n===Stalingrad: Winter 1942===\n{{Main|Battle of Stalingrad|Operation Little Saturn|Operation Mars|Third Battle of Kharkov|Battle for Velikiye Luki (1943)}}\n[[File:Eastern Front 1942-11 to 1943-03.png|thumb|Operations [[Operation Uranus|Uranus]], [[Operation Saturn|Saturn]] and [[Operation Mars|Mars]]: Soviet advances on the Eastern Front, 18 November 1942 to March 1943:\n{{legend|#fff8d5|to 12 December 1942}}\n{{legend|#ffd2b9|to 18 February 1943}}\n{{legend|#ccffcd|to March 1943 (Soviet gains only)}}]]\n\nWhile the German 6th and 4th Panzer Armies had been fighting their way into Stalingrad, Soviet armies had congregated on either side of the city, specifically into the Don [[bridgehead]]s, and it was from these that they struck in November 1942. In Operation ''[[Operation Uranus|Uranus]]'' started on 19 November, two Soviet fronts punched through the Romanian lines and converged at [[Kalach-na-Donu|Kalach]] on 23 November, trapping 300,000 Axis troops behind them.<ref>Shirer (1990), p.925\u2013926</ref> A simultaneous offensive on the Rzhev sector known as Operation ''[[Operation Mars|Mars]]'' was supposed to advance to Smolensk, but was a costly failure, with German tactical defences preventing any breakthrough.\n\n[[File:USSROfficerTT33.JPG|thumb|left|upright|A Soviet junior political officer ([[Political commissar|Politruk]]) urges Soviet troops forward against German positions (12 July 1942).]]\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B28822, Russland, Kampf um Stalingrad, Infanterie.jpg|thumb|German infantry and a supporting [[Sturmgesch\u00fctz III|StuG III]] assault gun during the advance towards Stalingrad, September 1942]]\n\nThe Germans rushed to transfer troops to the Soviet Union in a desperate attempt to relieve Stalingrad, but the offensive could not get going until 12 December, by which time the 6th Army in Stalingrad was starving and too weak to break out towards it. [[Operation Wintergewitter|Operation Winter Storm]], with three transferred panzer divisions, got going briskly from [[Kotelnikovo]] towards the Aksai river but became bogged down {{convert|65|km|mi|abbr=on}} short of its goal. To divert the rescue attempt, the Red Army decided to smash the Italians and come down behind the relief attempt if they could; that operation starting on 16 December. What it did accomplish was to destroy many of the aircraft that had been transporting relief supplies to Stalingrad. The fairly limited scope of the Soviet offensive, although still eventually targeted on Rostov, also allowed Hitler time to see sense and pull Army Group A out of the Caucasus and back over the Don.<ref>Shirer (1990), p.927\u2013928</ref>\n\nOn 31 January 1943, the 90,000 survivors of the 300,000-man 6th Army surrendered. By that time the Hungarian 2nd Army had also been wiped out. The Red Army advanced from the Don {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the west of Stalingrad, marching through Kursk (retaken on 8 February 1943) and Kharkov (retaken 16 February 1943). To save the position in the south, the Germans decided to abandon the Rzhev salient in February, freeing enough troops to make a successful [[riposte]] in eastern Ukraine. [[Manstein]]'s counteroffensive, strengthened by a specially trained [[II SS Panzer Corps|SS Panzer Corps]] equipped with [[Tiger I|Tiger tanks]], opened on 20 February 1943 and fought its way from [[Poltava]] [[Third Battle of Kharkov|back into Kharkov]] in the third week of March, when the spring thaw intervened.This left a glaring Soviet bulge ([[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|salient]]) in the front centered on Kursk.\n\n===Kursk: Summer 1943===\n{{Main|Battle of Kursk}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}\n[[File:RIAN archive 997 Soldiers and a gun on the road.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Soviet soldiers and 45mm gun on the road, 1 August 1943]]\n[[File:Eastern Front 1943-02 to 1943-08.png|thumb|German advances at [[Third Battle of Kharkov|Kharkov]] and [[Battle of Kursk|Kursk]], 19 February 1943 to 1 August 1943:\n{{legend|#ffd2b9|to 18 March 1943}}\n{{legend|#ccffcd|to 1 August 1943}}]]\n\nAfter the failure of the attempt to capture Stalingrad, Hitler had delegated planning authority for the upcoming campaign season to the [[German Army High Command]] and reinstated [[Heinz Guderian]] to a prominent role, this time as Inspector of Panzer Troops. Debate among the General Staff was polarised, with even Hitler nervous about any attempt to pinch off the Kursk salient. He knew that in the intervening six months the Soviet position at Kursk had been reinforced heavily with [[anti-tank]] guns, [[tank trap]]s, [[land mine|landmines]], [[barbed wire]], [[trench warfare|trenches]], [[Bunker#Pillbox|pillboxes]], [[artillery]] and [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]].<ref name=\"Mastny 1365\u20131388\">{{cite journal\n | last =Mastny\n | first =Vojtech\n | author-link =Vojtech Mastny\n | title =Stalin and the Prospects of a Separate Peace in World War II\n | journal =[[The American Historical Review]]\n | volume =77\n | issue =5\n | pages =1365\u20131388\n | date =December 1972\n | url =https://archive.org/details/MastnystalinAndProspectsOfSeparatePeaceInWorld\n | jstor =1861311\n  | doi =10.2307/1861311\n }}</ref>\n\nHowever, if one last great ''[[blitzkrieg]]'' offensive could be mounted, then attention could then be turned to the Allied threat to the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]].

It was part of the wider [[Battle of Kursk]].|alt=]]\n\nIn the north, the entire [[9th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 9th Army]] had been redeployed from the Rzhev salient into the Orel salient and was to advance from Maloarkhangelsk to Kursk. But its forces could not even get past the first objective at [[Olkhovatka]], just {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} into the advance. The 9th Army blunted its spearhead against the Soviet [[land mine|minefields]], frustratingly so considering that the high ground there was the only natural barrier between them and flat tank country all the way to Kursk. The direction of advance was then switched to [[Ponyri]], to the west of Olkhovatka, but the 9th Army could not break through here either and went over to the defensive. The Red Army then launched a counter-offensive, [[Operation Kutuzov]].\n\nOn 12 July the Red Army battled through the demarcation line between the 211th and 293rd divisions on the [[Zhizdra River]] and steamed towards [[Karachev]], right behind them and behind Orel. The southern offensive, spearheaded by [[German 4th Panzer Army|4th Panzer Army]], led by Gen. Col. [[Hermann Hoth|Hoth]], with three Tank Corps made more headway. Advancing on either side of the upper Donets on a narrow corridor, the [[II SS Panzer Corps]] and the [[Grossdeutschland Division|Gro\u00dfdeutschland Panzergrenadier divisions]] battled their way through minefields and over comparatively high ground towards [[Oboyan]]. Stiff resistance caused a change of direction from east to west of the front, but the tanks got {{convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on}} before encountering the reserves of the [[Soviet 5th Guards Tank Army]] outside [[Prokhorovka]]. Battle was joined on 12 July, with about one thousand tanks being engaged.\n\nAfter the war, the battle near Prochorovka was idealised by Soviet [[historian]]s as the largest tank battle of all time. The [[meeting engagement]] at Prochorovka was a Soviet defensive success, albeit at heavy cost. The Soviet 5th Guards Tank Army, with about 800 light and medium tanks, attacked elements of the II SS Panzer Corps. Tank losses on both sides have been the source of controversy ever since. Although the 5th Guards Tank Army did not attain its objectives, the German advance had been halted.\n\nAt the end of the day both sides had fought each other to a standstill, but regardless of the German failure in the north [[Erich von Manstein]] proposed he continue the attack with the 4th Panzer Army. The Red Army started the strong offensive operation in the northern Orel salient and achieved a breakthrough on the flank of the German 9th Army. Also worried by the Allies' [[Operation Husky|landing in Sicily]] on 10 July, Hitler made the decision to halt the offensive even as the German 9th Army was rapidly giving ground in the north. The Germans' final strategic offensive in the Soviet Union ended with their defence against a major Soviet counteroffensive that lasted into August.\n\nThe Kursk offensive was the last on the scale of 1940 and 1941 that the ''Wehrmacht'' was able to launch; subsequent offensives would represent only a shadow of previous German offensive might.\n\n===Autumn and Winter 1943\u201344===\n{{Main|Battle of the Korsun\u2013Cherkassy Pocket|Battle of Smolensk (1943)|Lower Dnieper Offensive|Dnieper-Carpathian Offensive|Leningrad\u2013Novgorod Offensive|Battle of Narva (1944)}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2015}}\n[[File:BM 13 TBiU 7.jpg|thumb|upright|\"[[Katyusha rocket launcher|Katyusha]]\" \u2013 a notable Soviet rocket launcher]]\nThe Soviet multi-stage summer offensive started with the advance into the Orel salient. The diversion of the well-equipped ''Gro\u00dfdeutschland Division'' from Belgorod to Karachev could not counteract it, and the Wehrmacht began a withdrawal from Orel (retaken by the Red Army on 5 August 1943), falling back to the Hagen line in front of [[Bryansk]]. To the south, the Red Army broke through Army Group South's Belgorod positions and headed for Kharkov once again. Although intense battles of movement throughout late July and into August 1943 saw the [[Tiger I|Tigers]] blunting Soviet tank attacks on one axis, they were soon outflanked on another line to the west as the Soviet forces advanced down the [[Olshanka|Psel]], and Kharkov was abandoned for the final time on 22 August.\n\nThe German forces on the [[Mius]], now comprising the 1st Panzer Army and a reconstituted 6th Army, were by August too weak to repulse a Soviet attack on their own front, and when the Red Army hit them they retreated all the way through the [[Donbass]] industrial region to the Dnieper, losing half the farmland that Germany had invaded the Soviet Union to exploit. At this time Hitler agreed to a general withdrawal to the Dnieper line, along which was meant to be the ''Ostwall'', a line of defence similar to the [[Westwall#Reactivation of the Siegfried Line, 1944|Westwall]] (Siegfried Line) of fortifications along the German frontier in the west.\n\nThe main problem for the Wehrmacht was that these defences had not yet been built; by the time Army Group South had evacuated eastern Ukraine and begun withdrawing across the Dnieper during September, the Soviet forces were hard behind them. Tenaciously, small units paddled their way across the {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide river and established [[bridgehead]]s. A second attempt by the Red Army to gain land using parachutists, mounted at [[Kaniv]] on 24 September, proved as disappointing as at Dorogobuzh eighteen months previously. The paratroopers were soon repelled \u2013 but not until still more Red Army troops had used the cover they provided to get themselves over the Dnieper and securely dug in.\n\n[[File:Roza Shanina.jpg|thumb|upright|Soviet sniper [[Roza Shanina]] in 1944.

Important Dnieper towns started to fall, with [[Zaporozhye]] the first to go, followed by [[Dnepropetrovsk]]. Finally, early in November the Red Army broke out of its bridgeheads on either side of Kiev and captured the Ukrainian capital, at that time the third largest city in the Soviet Union.\n\nEighty miles west of Kiev, the 4th Panzer Army, still convinced that the Red Army was a spent force, was able to mount a successful riposte at [[Zhytomyr]] during the middle of November, weakening the Soviet bridgehead by a daring outflanking strike mounted by the SS Panzer Corps along the river Teterev. This battle also enabled Army Group South to recapture Korosten and gain some time to rest. However, on [[Christmas Eve]] the retreat began anew when the First Ukrainian Front (renamed from the Voronezh Front) struck them in the same place. The Soviet advance continued along the railway line until the 1939 Polish\u2013Soviet border was reached on 3 January 1944.\n\nTo the south, the Second Ukrainian Front (ex [[Steppe Front]]) had crossed the Dnieper at [[Kremenchug]] and continued westwards. In the second week of January 1944 they swung north, meeting Vatutin's tank forces which had swung south from their penetration into Poland and surrounding ten German divisions at Korsun\u2013Shevchenkovsky, west of [[Korsun\u2013Shevchenkovsky Offensive|Cherkassy]]. Hitler's insistence on holding the Dnieper line, even when facing the prospect of catastrophic defeat, was compounded by his conviction that the Cherkassy pocket could break out and even advance to Kiev, but Manstein was more concerned about being able to advance to the edge of the pocket and then implore the surrounded forces to break out.\n\nBy 16 February the first stage was complete, with panzers separated from the contracting Cherkassy pocket only by the swollen Gniloy Tikich river. Under shellfire and pursued by Soviet tanks, the surrounded German troops, among whom were the [[SS Division (motorised) Wiking|5th SS Panzer Division ''Wiking'']], fought their way across the river to safety, although at the cost of half their number and all their equipment. They assumed the Red Army would not attack again, with the spring approaching, but on 3 March the Soviet Ukrainian Front went over to the offensive. Having already isolated the Crimea by severing the [[Isthmus of Perekop|Perekop isthmus]], Malinovsky's forces advanced across the mud to the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian]] border, not stopping on the river [[Prut]].\n\n[[File:Eastern Front 1943-08 to 1944-12.png|thumb|Soviet advances from 1 August 1943 to 31 December 1944: {{legend|#fff8d5|to 1 December 1943}} {{legend|#ffd2b9|to 30 April 1944}} {{legend|#ebd7ff|to 19 August 1944}} {{legend|#ccffcd|to 31 December 1944}}]]\nOne final move in the south completed the 1943\u201344 campaigning season, which had wrapped up a Soviet advance of over 500 miles. In March, 20 German divisions of ''[[Generaloberst]]'' [[Hans-Valentin Hube]]'s [[1st Panzer Army]] were encircled in what was to be known as [[Kamenets-Podolsky pocket|Hube's Pocket]] near Kamenets-Podolskiy. After two weeks' of heavy fighting, the 1st Panzer managed to escape the pocket, at the cost of losing almost the entire heavy equipment. At this point, Hitler sacked several prominent generals, Manstein included. In April, the Red Army took back [[Odessa]], followed by 4th Ukrainian Front's campaign to restore control over the Crimea, which culminated in the capture of [[Sevastopol]] on 10 May.\n\nAlong Army Group Centre's front, August 1943 saw this force pushed back from the Hagen line slowly, ceding comparatively little territory, but the loss of Bryansk, and more importantly Smolensk, on 25 September cost the ''Wehrmacht'' the keystone of the entire German defensive system. The 4th and 9th armies and 3rd Panzer Army still held their own east of the upper Dnieper, stifling Soviet attempts to reach Vitebsk. On Army Group North's front, there was barely any fighting at all until January 1944, when out of nowhere Volkhov and Second Baltic Fronts struck.<ref name=\"glantz\"/>\n\nIn a lightning campaign, the Germans were pushed back from Leningrad and [[Novgorod]] was captured by Soviet forces. After a 75-mile advance in January and February, the Leningrad Front had reached the borders of Estonia.

Accordingly, they stripped troops from Army Group Centre, whose front still protruded deep into the Soviet Union. The Germans had transferred some units to France to counter the [[invasion of Normandy]] two weeks before. The Belorussian Offensive (codenamed [[Operation Bagration]]), which was agreed upon by Allies at the [[Tehran Conference]] in December 1943 and launched on 22 June 1944, was a massive Soviet attack, consisting of four Soviet army groups totalling over 120 divisions that smashed into a thinly held German line.\n\nThey focused their massive attacks on Army Group Centre, not Army Group North Ukraine as the Germans had originally expected. More than 2.3 million Soviet troops went into action against German Army Group Centre, which had a strength of fewer than 800,000 men. At the points of attack, the numerical and quality advantages of the Soviet forces were overwhelming. The Red Army achieved a ratio of ten to one in tanks and seven to one in aircraft over their enemy. The Germans crumbled. The capital of [[Belarus]], [[Minsk]], was taken on 3 July, trapping some 100,000 Germans. Ten days later the Red Army reached the prewar Polish border. ''Bagration'' was, by any measure, one of the largest single operations of the war.\n\nBy the end of August 1944, it had cost the Germans ~400,000 dead, wounded, missing and sick, from whom 160,000 were captured, as well as 2,000 tanks and 57,000 other vehicles.

Stalin and Hitler both disregarded human life in order to achieve their goal of victory. This included the terrorisation of their own people, as well as [[mass deportation]]s of entire populations.

Behind the front lines, [[wikt:atrocity|atrocities]] against civilians in German-occupied areas were routine, including those carried out as part of the Holocaust. German and German-allied forces treated civilian populations with exceptional brutality, massacring whole village populations and routinely killing civilian hostages (see [[German war crimes]]). Both sides practised widespread [[scorched earth]] tactics, but the loss of civilian lives in the case of Germany was incomparably smaller than that of the Soviet Union, in which at least 20 million were killed. According to British historian [[Geoffrey Hosking]], \"The full demographic loss to the Soviet peoples was even greater: since a high proportion of those killed were young men of child-begetting age, the postwar Soviet population was 45 to 50 million smaller than post-1939 projections would have led one to expect.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Hosking|first=Geoffrey A.|title=Rulers and Victims: The Russians in the Soviet Union|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CDMVMqDvp4QC&pg=PA242|year=2006|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02178-5|page=242}}</ref>\n\nWhen the Red Army invaded Germany in 1944, many German civilians suffered from reprisals by Red Army soldiers (see [[Soviet war crimes]]). After the war, following the [[Yalta conference]] agreements between the Allies, the [[German people|German populations]] of [[East Prussia]] and [[Silesia]] were [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944\u20131950)|displaced to the west]] of the [[Oder\u2013Neisse line]], in what became one of the largest [[forced migration]]s of people in world history.\n\nThe Soviet Union came out of World War II militarily victorious but economically and structurally devastated. Much of the combat took place in or close to populated areas, and the actions of both sides contributed to massive loss of civilian life and tremendous material damage. According to a summary, presented by Lieutenant General [[Roman Rudenko]] at the [[Nuremberg Trials|International Military Tribunal]] in [[Nuremberg]], the property damage in the Soviet Union inflicted by the Axis invasion was estimated to a value of 679 billion rubles. The largest number of civilian deaths in a single city was 1.2 million citizens dead during the [[Siege of Leningrad]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''[[The New York Times]]'', 9 February 1946, Volume 95, Number 32158.</ref>\n\nThe combined damage consisted of complete or partial destruction of 1,710 cities and towns, 70,000 villages/hamlets, 2,508 church buildings, 31,850 industrial establishments, 40,000 miles of railroad, 4,100 railroad stations, 40,000 hospitals, 84,000 schools, and 43,000 public libraries; leaving 25 million homeless. Seven million horses, 17 million cattle, 20 million pigs, 27 million sheep were also slaughtered or driven off.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Wild fauna were also affected. Wolves and foxes fleeing westward from the killing zone, as the Soviet army advanced between 1943 and 1945, were responsible for a [[rabies]] epidemic that spread slowly westwards, reaching the coast of the [[English Channel]] by 1968.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bellamy|2007|pp=1\u20132}}</ref>\n\n==Leadership==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}\nThe Soviet Union and Nazi Germany were both ideologically driven states (by [[Soviet communism]] and by [[Nazism]] respectively), in which the foremost political [[leader]]s had [[Totalitarianism|near-absolute power]]. The character of the war was thus determined by the political leaders and their [[ideology]] to a much greater extent than in any other theatre of World War II.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n===Adolf Hitler===\n{{Main|Adolf Hitler}}\n[[File:Adolf Hitler cropped restored.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Adolf Hitler]] led Germany during World War II.]]\n\nAdolf Hitler exercised tight control over the German war-effort, spending much of his time in his command bunkers (most notably at [[Rastenburg]] in [[East Prussia]], at [[Vinnitsa]] in [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukraine]], and under the garden of the [[Reich Chancellery]] in [[Berlin]]). At crucial periods in the war he held daily situation-conferences at which he used his remarkable talent for public speaking to overwhelm opposition from his generals and from the OKW staff with rhetoric.\n\nIn part because of the unexpected degree of German success in the Battle of France (despite the warnings of the professional military) Hitler believed himself a military genius, with a grasp of the total war-effort that eluded his generals. In August 1941, when [[Walther von Brauchitsch]] (commander-in-chief of the ''Wehrmacht'') and [[Fedor von Bock]] appealed for an attack on Moscow, Hitler instead ordered the encirclement and capture of Ukraine, in order to acquire the farmland, industry, and natural resources of that country. Some historians like Bevin Alexander in ''How Hitler Could Have Won'' regard this decision as a missed opportunity to win the war.\n\nIn the winter of 1941\u20131942 Hitler believed that his obstinate refusal to allow the German armies to retreat had saved Army Group Centre from collapse. He later told [[Erhard Milch]]:\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B24543, Hauptquartier Heeresgruppe S\u00fcd, Lagebesprechung.jpg|thumb|Hitler with generals [[Friedrich Paulus]], [[Adolf Heusinger]] and [[Fedor von Bock]] in Poltawa, German-occupied Ukraine, June 1942]]\n\n<blockquote>\nI had to act ruthlessly. I had to send even my closest generals packing, two army generals, for example \u2026 I could only tell these gentlemen, \"Get yourself back to Germany as rapidly as you can \u2013 but leave the army in my charge. And the army is staying at the front.\"\n</blockquote>\n\nThe success of this [[hedgehog defence]] outside Moscow led Hitler to insist on the holding of territory when it made no military sense, and to sack generals who retreated without orders. Officers with initiative were replaced with yes-men or with fanatical Nazis. The disastrous encirclements later in the war \u2013 at [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]], [[Korsun\u2013Cherkassy Pocket|Korsun]] and many other places \u2013 resulted directly from Hitler's orders. This idea of holding territory led to another failed plan, dubbed{{by whom|date=May 2018}} \"''Heaven-bound Missions''\", which involved fortifying even the most unimportant or insignificant of cities and the holding of these \"fortresses\" at all costs. Many divisions became cut off in \"fortress\" cities, or wasted uselessly in secondary theatres, because Hitler would not sanction retreat or voluntarily abandon any of his conquests.\n\nFrustration at Hitler's [[leadership]] in the war was one of the factors in the attempted [[coup d'etat]] of 1944, but after the failure of the [[20 July Plot]] Hitler considered the army and its officer corps suspect and came to rely on the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) and Nazi party members to prosecute the war.\n\nHitler's direction of the war ultimately proved disastrous for the German Army, though the skill, loyalty, professionalism and endurance of officers and soldiers enabled him to keep Germany fighting to the end. [[F. W. Winterbotham]] wrote of Hitler's signal to [[Gerd von Rundstedt]] to continue the attack to the west during the [[Battle of the Bulge]]:\n\n{{quote|From experience we had learned that when Hitler started refusing to do what the generals recommended, things started to go wrong, and this was to be no exception.}}\n\n===Joseph Stalin===\n{{Main|Joseph Stalin}}\n[[File:CroppedStalin1943.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Stalin]] led the Soviet Union during World War II.]]\n\nJoseph Stalin bore the greatest responsibility for some of the disasters at the beginning of the war (for example, the [[Battle of Kiev (1941)]]), but equally deserves praise for the subsequent success of the Soviet [[Red Army]], which depended on the unprecedentedly [[History of the Soviet Union (1927\u20131953)|rapid industrialisation of the Soviet Union]], which Stalin's internal policy had made the first priority throughout the 1930s.\nStalin's [[Great Purge]] of the Red Army in the late 1930s involved the legal prosecution of many of the senior command, many of whom the courts convicted and sentenced to death or to imprisonment.\n\nThe executed included [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]], a proponent of armoured [[blitzkrieg]]. Stalin promoted some [[obscurantist]]s like [[Grigory Kulik]] who opposed the mechanisation of the army and the production of tanks, but on the other hand purged the older commanders who had held their positions since the [[Russian Civil War]] of 1917\u20131922, and who had experience, but were deemed \"politically unreliable\". This opened up their places to the promotion of many younger officers that Stalin and the [[NKVD]] regarded as in line with [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] politics. Many{{quantify|date=May 2018}} of these newly promoted commanders proved terribly inexperienced, but some later became very successful. Soviet tank-output remained the largest in the world.\n\nFrom the foundation of the Red Army in 1918, political distrust of the military had led to a system of \"dual command\", with every commander paired with a [[political commissar]], a member of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. Larger units had military councils consisting of the commander, commissar and chief of staff \u2013 commissars ensured the loyalty of the commanding officers and implemented Party orders.\n\nFollowing the [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|Soviet occupation of eastern Poland]], of the [[Occupation and annexation of the Baltic states by the Soviet Union (1940)|Baltic states]] and of [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina]] in 1939\u20131940, Stalin insisted on the occupation of every fold of the newly Sovietized territories; this move westward positioned troops far from their depots, in salients that left them vulnerable to encirclement. As tension heightened in spring, 1941, Stalin desperately tried not to give Hitler any provocation that Berlin could use as an excuse for a German attack; Stalin refused to allow the military to go on the alert \u2013 even as German troops gathered on the borders and German reconnaissance planes overflew installations. This refusal to take necessary action was instrumental in the destruction of major portions of the Red Air Force, lined up on its airfields, in the first days of the German-Soviet war.\n\nAt the crisis of the war, in the autumn of 1942, Stalin made many concessions to the army: the government restored unitary command by removing the Commissars from the [[chain of command]]. Order 25 of 15 January 1943 introduced [[Shoulder mark|shoulderboards]] for all ranks; this represented a significant symbolic step, since after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] shoulderboards had connotations as a symbol of the old Tsarist r\u00e9gime. Beginning in autumn 1941, units that had proved themselves by superior performance in combat were given the traditional \"Guards\" title.{{Sfn | Glantz | 2005 | p = 181}}\n\nThese concessions were combined with ruthless discipline: [[Order No. 227]], issued on 28 July 1942, threatened commanders who retreated without orders with punishment by [[court-martial]]. Infractions by military and ''[[politruk]]s'' were punished with transferral to [[penal battalion]]s and to penal [[Company (military unit)|companies]] which carried out especially hazardous duties, such as serving as ''tramplers'' to clear Nazi minefields.<ref>{{Citation | last = Toppe | first = Alfred | title = Night Combat | publisher = Diane | year = 1998 | isbn = 978-0-7881-7080-5 | page = 28}}</ref> The order stipulated to capture or shoot \"cowards\" and fleeing panicked troops at the rear the blocking detachments in the first three months shot 1,000 penal troops and sent 24,993 to penal battalions.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Stalin's Wars: From World War to Cold War, 1939\u20131953|last=Roberts|first=Geoffrey|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2006|isbn=0-300-11204-1|pages=132}}</ref> By October 1942 the idea of regular blocking detachments was quietly dropped, By 29 October 1944 the units were officially disbanded.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bdsa.ru/%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%B7%D1%8B-%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%BE-%D0%B7%D0%B0-1944-%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%B4/784-636|title=\u041f\u0420\u0418\u041a\u0410\u0417 \u041e \u0420\u0410\u0421\u0424\u041e\u0420\u041c\u0418\u0420\u041e\u0412\u0410\u041d\u0418\u0418 \u041e\u0422\u0414\u0415\u041b\u042c\u041d\u042b\u0425 \u0417\u0410\u0413\u0420\u0410\u0414\u0418\u0422\u0415\u041b\u042c\u041d\u042b\u0425 \u041e\u0422\u0420\u042f\u0414\u041e\u0412|website=bdsa.ru|access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Ivan's War: Life and Death in the Red Army|last=Merridale|first=Catherine|publisher=New York : Metropolitan Books|year=2006|isbn=0-8050-7455-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/ivanswarlifedeat00merr_0/page/158 158]|oclc=60671899|url=https://archive.org/details/ivanswarlifedeat00merr_0/page/158}}</ref>\n\nAs it became clear that the Soviet Union would win the war, Stalin ensured that propaganda always mentioned his leadership of the war; he sidelined the victorious generals and never allowed them to develop into political rivals.

For the majority of people of the Soviet Union, the Nazi invasion was viewed as a brutal act of unprovoked aggression. While it is important to note that not all parts of Soviet society viewed the German advance in this way, the majority of the Soviet population viewed German forces as occupiers. In areas such as [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], and [[Lithuania]] (which had been annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940) the ''Wehrmacht'' was tolerated by a relatively more significant part of the native population.\n\nThis was particularly true for the territories of Western Ukraine, recently rejoined to the Soviet Union, where the anti-Polish and anti-Soviet [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|Ukrainian nationalist underground]] hoped in vain to establish the \"independent state\", relying on German armed force. However, Soviet society as a whole was hostile to the invading Nazis from the very start. The nascent national liberation movements among Ukrainians and [[Cossack]]s, and others were viewed by Hitler with suspicion; some, especially those from the Baltic States, were co-opted into the Axis armies and others brutally suppressed. None of the conquered territories gained any measure of self-rule.\n\nInstead, the [[Nazism|Nazi ideologues]] saw the future of the East as one of settlement by German colonists, with the natives killed, expelled, or reduced to slave labour. The cruel and brutally inhumane treatment of Soviet civilians, women, children and elderly, the daily bombings of civilian cities and towns, Nazi pillaging of Soviet villages and hamlets and unprecedented harsh punishment and treatment of civilians in general were some of the primary reasons for Soviet resistance to Nazi Germany's invasion. Indeed, the Soviets viewed Germany's invasion as an act of aggression and an attempt to conquer and enslave the local population.\n\n[[File:Einsatzgruppen murder Jews in Ivanhorod, Ukraine, 1942.jpg|link=Ivanhorod Einsatzgruppen photograph, 1942|thumb|[[Ivanhorod Einsatzgruppen photograph|Einsatzgruppen murdering Jews]] in [[Ivanhorod]], Ukraine, 1942]]\nRegions closer to the front were managed by military powers of the region, in other areas such as the Baltic states annexed by the USSR in 1940, Reichscommissariats were established. As a rule, the maximum in loot was extracted. In September 1941, [[Erich Koch]] was appointed to the Ukrainian Commissariat. His opening speech was clear about German policy: \"I am known as a brutal dog ... Our job is to suck from Ukraine all the goods we can get hold of ... I am expecting from you the utmost severity towards the native population.\"\n\nAtrocities against the Jewish population in the conquered areas began almost immediately, with the dispatch of ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' (task groups) to round up Jews and shoot them.<ref>[http://www1.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/barbarossa/ Marking 70 Years to Operation Barbarossa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916093736/http://www1.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/barbarossa/ |date=16 September 2012 }} on the [[Yad Vashem]] website</ref>\n\nThe massacres of Jews and other [[Ethnic minority|ethnic minorities]] were only a part of the deaths from the Nazi occupation. Many hundreds of thousands of Soviet civilians were executed, and millions more died from [[starvation]] as the Germans requisitioned food for their armies and fodder for their draft horses. As they retreated from Ukraine and Belarus in 1943\u201344, the German occupiers systematically applied a [[scorched earth]] policy, burning towns and cities, destroying infrastructure, and leaving civilians to starve or die of exposure.<ref>On 7 September 1943, [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]] sent orders to [[HSSPF]] \"Ukraine\" [[Hans-Adolf Pr\u00fctzmann]] that \"not a human being, not a single head of cattle, not a hundredweight of cereals and not a railway line remain behind; that not a house remains standing, not a mine is available which is not destroyed for years to come, that there is not a well which is not poisoned. The enemy must really find completely burned and destroyed land\". He ordered cooperation with Infantry general Staff, also someone named Stampf, and sent copies to the Chief of Regular Police, Chief of Security Police & SS, [[SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]] Berger, and the chief of the partisan combating units. See ''Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression, Supplement A'' pg 1270.</ref> In many towns, the battles were fought within towns and cities with trapped civilians caught in the middle. Estimates of total civilian dead in the Soviet Union in the war range from seven million (''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'') to seventeen million (Richard Overy).\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-031-2436-03A, Russland, Hinrichtung von Partisanen.jpg|thumb|[[Soviet partisans]] hanged by German forces in January 1943]]\nThe Nazi ideology and the maltreatment of the local population and Soviet POWs encouraged [[Partisan (military)|partisans]] fighting behind the front; it motivated even anti-communists or non-Russian nationalists to ally with the Soviets and greatly delayed the formation of German-allied divisions consisting of Soviet POWs (see [[Vlasov army]]). These results and missed opportunities contributed to the defeat of the ''Wehrmacht''.\n\nVadim Erlikman has detailed Soviet losses totalling 26.5 million war related deaths.

Stalin's [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|five-year plans]] of the 1930s had resulted in the industrialisation of the Urals and central Asia. In 1941, thousands of trains evacuated critical factories and workers from Belarus and Ukraine to safe areas far from the front lines. Once these facilities were reassembled east of the Urals, production could be resumed without fear of German bombing.\n\nAs the Soviet Union's manpower reserves ran low from 1943 onwards, the great Soviet offensives had to depend more on equipment and less on the expenditure of lives.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} The increases in production of [[materiel]] were achieved at the expense of civilian living standards \u2013 the most thorough application of the principle of [[total war]] \u2013 and with the help of [[Lend-Lease]] supplies from the United Kingdom and the United States. The Germans, on the other hand, could rely on a large slave workforce from the conquered countries and Soviet POWs. American exports and technical expertise also enabled the Soviets to produce goods that they wouldn't have been able to on their own. For example, while the USSR was able to produce fuel of octane numbers from 70 to 74, Soviet industry only met 4% of demand for fuel of octane numbers from 90+; all aircraft produced after 1939 required fuel of the latter category. To fulfill demands, the USSR depended on American assistance, both in finished products and TEL.<ref>Alexander Matveichuk.

Consumption on all fronts during the same period was 1.493 million tons of explosives and 626,887 tons of powder.<ref>US Strategic Bombing Survey \"Appendix D. Strategic Air Attack on the Powder and Explosives Industries\", Table D7: German Monthly Production of Powders and Exploders (Including Extenders) and Consumption by German Armed Forces</ref> From 1941\u20131945, the USSR produced only 505,000 tons of explosives and received 105,000 tons of Lend-Lease imports.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Germany outproduced the Soviet Union 3.16 to 1 in explosives tonnage.\n\nSoviet armoured fighting vehicle production was greater than the Germans (in 1943, the [[Soviet armored fighting vehicle production during World War II|Soviet Union manufactured 24,089 tanks and self-propelled guns]] to [[German armored fighting vehicle production during World War II|Germany's 19,800]]). The Soviets incrementally upgraded existing designs, and simplified and refined manufacturing processes to increase production, and were helped by a mass infusion of harder to produce goods such as aviation fuel, machine tools, trucks, and high-explosives from Lend-Lease, allowing them to concentrate on a few key industries. Meanwhile, Germany had been cut off from foreign trade for years by the time it invaded the USSR, was in the middle of two extended and costly theatres at air and sea that further limited production ([[Battle of the Atlantic]] and [[Defence of the Reich]]), and was forced to devote a large segment of its expenditures to goods the Soviets could cut back on (such as trucks) or which would never even be used against the Soviets (such as ships). Naval vessels alone constituted 10\u201315% of Germany's war expenditures from 1940 to 1944 depending on the year, while armoured vehicles by comparison were only 5\u20138%.<ref>Military Analysis Division, U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey- European War, Volume 3, page 144.

The multiple battles and the use of [[scorched earth]] tactics destroyed [[Agriculture|agricultural land]], infrastructure, and whole towns, leaving much of the population homeless and without food.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Military losses on the Eastern Front during World War II<ref>R\u00fcdiger Overmans, ''Deutsche milit\u00e4rische Verluste im Zweiten Weltkrieg''.

Hitler had always intended to renege on his pact with the Soviet Union, eventually making the decision to invade in the spring of 1941.\n\nSome historians say Stalin was fearful of war with Germany, or just did not expect Germany to start a [[two-front war]], and was reluctant to do anything to provoke Hitler. Others say that Stalin was eager for Germany to be at war with capitalist countries. Another viewpoint is that Stalin expected war in 1942 (the time when all his preparations would be complete) and stubbornly refused to believe its early arrival.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hardesty|first=Von|title=Red Phoenix: The Rise of Soviet Air Power, 1941\u20131945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z-lmAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA16|year=1982|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press|isbn=978-0-87474-510-8|page=16}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-219-0595-05, Russland-Mitte-S\u00fcd, Infanteristen.jpg|thumb|German infantry in Russia, June 1943]]\nBritish historians Alan S.

As in the [[Sino-Soviet conflict (1929)|Sino-Soviet conflict]] on the [[Chinese Eastern Railway]] or [[Soviet\u2013Japanese Border Wars|Soviet\u2013Japanese border conflicts]], Soviet troops on the western border received a directive, signed by [[Marshal of the Soviet Union|Marshal]] [[Semyon Timoshenko]] and [[Army General (Soviet rank)|General of the Army]] [[Georgy Zhukov]], that ordered (as demanded by Stalin): \"do not answer to any provocations\" and \"do not undertake any (offensive) actions without specific orders\" \u2013 which meant that Soviet troops could open fire only on their soil and forbade counter-attack on German soil. The German invasion therefore caught the Soviet military and civilian leadership largely by surprise.\n\nThe extent of warnings received by Stalin about a German invasion is controversial, and the claim that there was a warning that \"Germany will attack on 22 June without declaration of war\" has been dismissed as a \"popular myth\". However, some sources quoted in the articles on Soviet spies [[Richard Sorge]] and [[Willi Lehmann]], say they had sent warnings of an attack on 20 or 22 June, which were treated as \"disinformation\". The [[Lucy spy ring]] in Switzerland also sent warnings, possibly deriving from Ultra codebreaking in Britain.\n\nSoviet intelligence was fooled by German disinformation, so sent false alarms to Moscow about a German invasion in April, May and the beginning of June. Soviet intelligence reported that Germany would rather invade the USSR after the fall of the British Empire<ref>Source: L. E.

In addition to Germany, hundreds of thousands of tons of bombs were dropped on their eastern allies of [[Bombing of Romania in World War II|Romania]] and [[Strategic bombing during World War II#Allied bombing statistics 1939\u201345|Hungary]], [[Operation Tidal Wave|primarily in an attempt to cripple Romanian oil production]].\n\nBritish and Commonwealth forces also contributed directly to the fighting on the Eastern Front through their service in the [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Arctic convoys]] and [[No. 151 Wing RAF|training Red Air Force pilots]], as well as in the provision of early material and intelligence support.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|+Allied shipments to the Soviet Union<ref>Hans-Adolf Jacobsen: ''1939\u20131945, Der Zweite Weltkrieg in Chronik und Dokumenten''.

However, access to (and control of) the [[resource]]s, raw materials and production capacity required to entertain long-term goals (such as European control, German territorial expansion and the destruction of the USSR) were limited. Political demands necessitated the expansion of Germany's control of natural and human resources, industrial capacity and farmland beyond its borders (conquered territories). Germany's military production was tied to resources outside its area of control, a dynamic not found amongst the Allies.\n\nDuring the war, as Germany acquired new territories (either by direct annexation or by installing puppet governments in defeated countries), these new territories were forced to sell raw materials and agricultural products to German buyers at extremely low prices. Two-thirds of all French trains in 1941 were used to carry goods to Germany. [[Norway]] lost 20% of its national income in 1940 and 40% in 1943.{{sfn|Braun|1990|p=121}} Axis allies such as [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], [[Finland]], [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatia]] and [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] benefited from Germany's net imports. Overall, [[Vichy France|France]] made the largest contribution to the German war effort. In 1943\u201344, French payments to Germany may have risen to as much as 55% of French GDP.<ref>[https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-history-of-the-second-world-war/economics-of-the-war-with-nazi-germany/E2F3FE2B9549A00F2E992673C5C8B28D/core-reader The economics of the war with Nazi Germany]</ref> Overall, Germany imported 20% of its food and 33% of its raw materials from conquered territories and Axis allies.<ref>https://www.bbc.com/bitesize/guides/z2932p3/revision/4</ref>\n\nOn 27 May 1940, Germany signed the \"Oil Pact\" with Romania, by which Germany would trade arms for oil. Romania's oil production amounted to approximately 6,000,000 tons annually. This production represents 35% of the total fuel production of the Axis including the synthetic products and the substitutes and 70% of the total production of crude oil.<ref>A History of Romanian Oil, Vol. II, p. 245</ref> In 1941, Germany only had 18% of the oil it had in peacetime.

They were supplied by air until April when they were given permission to regain the Soviet main lines. Only part of Belov's Cavalry Corps made it to safety however, while Yefremov's men fought \"a losing battle.\"<ref name=GeorgyZhukov/>{{rp|59\u201362}}\n\nBy April 1942, the Soviet Supreme Command agreed to assume the defensive so as to \"consolidate the captured ground.\" According to Zhukov, ''\"During the winter offensive, the forces of the Western Front had advanced from 70 to 100&nbsp;km, which somewhat improved the overall operational and strategic situation on the Western sector.\"''<ref name=GeorgyZhukov/>{{rp|64}}\n\nTo the north, the Red Army surrounded a German [[garrison]] in [[Demyansk]], which held out with air supply for four months, and established themselves in front of [[Kholm, Kholmsky District, Novgorod Oblast|Kholm]], [[Velizh]], and [[Velikie Luki]].\n\nFurther north still, the Soviet Second Shock Army was unleashed on the [[Volkhov River]]. Initially this made some progress; however, it was unsupported, and by June a German counterattack cut off and destroyed the army. The Soviet commander, Lieutenant General [[Andrey Vlasov]], later defected to Germany and formed the ROA or [[Russian Liberation Army]].\n\nIn the south the Red Army lunged over the [[Donets River]] at [[Izyum]] and drove a {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} deep salient. The intent was to pin Army Group South against the [[Sea of Azov]], but as the winter eased the Wehrmacht counter-attacked and cut off the over-extended Soviet troops in the [[Second Battle of Kharkov]].\n\n===Don, Volga, and Caucasus: Summer 1942===\n{{Main|Case Blue|Battle of Voronezh (1942)|Battle of Caucasus|Battle of Stalingrad}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}\n[[File:Eastern Front 1942-05 to 1942-11.png|thumb|[[Operation Blue]]: German advances from 7 May 1942 to 18 November 1942:\n{{legend|#fff8d5|to 7 July 1942}}\n{{legend|#ffd2b9|to 22 July 1942}}\n{{legend|#ebd7ff|to 1 August 1942}}\n{{legend|#ccffcd|to 18 November 1942}}]]\n\nAlthough plans were made to attack Moscow again, on 28 June 1942, the offensive re-opened in a different direction. Army Group South took the initiative, anchoring the front with the [[Battle of Voronezh (1942)|Battle of Voronezh]] and then following the [[Don River, Russia|Don river]] southeastwards. The grand plan was to secure the Don and [[Volga]] first and then drive into the Caucasus towards [[Petroleum industry in Azerbaijan|the oil fields]], but operational considerations and Hitler's vanity made him order both objectives to be attempted simultaneously. Rostov was recaptured on 24 July when the 1st Panzer Army joined in, and then that group drove south towards [[Maykop|Maikop]]. As part of this, Operation ''Shamil'' was executed, a plan whereby a group of [[Brandenburger commando]]s dressed up as Soviet [[NKVD]] troops to destabilise Maikop's defences and allow the 1st Panzer Army to enter the oil town with little opposition.\n\nMeanwhile, the 6th Army was driving towards [[Stalingrad]], for a long period unsupported by 4th Panzer Army, which had been diverted to help 1st Panzer Army cross the Don. By the time the 4th Panzer Army had rejoined the Stalingrad offensive Soviet resistance (comprising the 62nd Army under [[Vasily Chuikov]]) had stiffened. A leap across the Don brought German troops to the Volga on 23 August but for the next three months the ''Wehrmacht'' would be fighting the Battle of Stalingrad street-by-street.\n\nTowards the south, the 1st Panzer Army had reached the Caucasian foothills and the [[Malka River]]. At the end of August Romanian mountain troops joined the Caucasian spearhead, while the Romanian 3rd and 4th armies were redeployed from their successful task of clearing the Azov [[littoral]]. They took up position on either side of Stalingrad to free German troops for the main offensive. Mindful of the continuing antagonism between Axis allies Romania and [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] over [[Transylvania]], the Romanian army in the Don bend was separated from the Hungarian 2nd army by the Italian 8th Army. Thus, all of Hitler's allies were involved \u2013 including a [[Slovak Republic (1939\u20131945)|Slovakian]] contingent with the 1st Panzer Army and a [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatian]] [[regiment]] attached to 6th Army.\n\nThe advance into the Caucasus bogged down, with the Germans unable to fight their way past [[Malgobek]] and to the main prize of [[Grozny]]. Instead, they switched the direction of their advance to approach it from the south, crossing the Malka at the end of October and entering [[North Ossetia\u2013Alania|North Ossetia]]. In the first week of November, on the outskirts of [[Vladikavkaz|Ordzhonikidze]], the 13th Panzer Division's spearhead was snipped off and the panzer troops had to fall back. The offensive into Russia was over.\n\n===Stalingrad: Winter 1942===\n{{Main|Battle of Stalingrad|Operation Little Saturn|Operation Mars|Third Battle of Kharkov|Battle for Velikiye Luki (1943)}}\n[[File:Eastern Front 1942-11 to 1943-03.png|thumb|Operations [[Operation Uranus|Uranus]], [[Operation Saturn|Saturn]] and [[Operation Mars|Mars]]: Soviet advances on the Eastern Front, 18 November 1942 to March 1943:\n{{legend|#fff8d5|to 12 December 1942}}\n{{legend|#ffd2b9|to 18 February 1943}}\n{{legend|#ccffcd|to March 1943 (Soviet gains only)}}]]\n\nWhile the German 6th and 4th Panzer Armies had been fighting their way into Stalingrad, Soviet armies had congregated on either side of the city, specifically into the Don [[bridgehead]]s, and it was from these that they struck in November 1942. In Operation ''[[Operation Uranus|Uranus]]'' started on 19 November, two Soviet fronts punched through the Romanian lines and converged at [[Kalach-na-Donu|Kalach]] on 23 November, trapping 300,000 Axis troops behind them.<ref>Shirer (1990), p.925\u2013926</ref> A simultaneous offensive on the Rzhev sector known as Operation ''[[Operation Mars|Mars]]'' was supposed to advance to Smolensk, but was a costly failure, with German tactical defences preventing any breakthrough.\n\n[[File:USSROfficerTT33.JPG|thumb|left|upright|A Soviet junior political officer ([[Political commissar|Politruk]]) urges Soviet troops forward against German positions (12 July 1942).]]\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B28822, Russland, Kampf um Stalingrad, Infanterie.jpg|thumb|German infantry and a supporting [[Sturmgesch\u00fctz III|StuG III]] assault gun during the advance towards Stalingrad, September 1942]]\n\nThe Germans rushed to transfer troops to the Soviet Union in a desperate attempt to relieve Stalingrad, but the offensive could not get going until 12 December, by which time the 6th Army in Stalingrad was starving and too weak to break out towards it. [[Operation Wintergewitter|Operation Winter Storm]], with three transferred panzer divisions, got going briskly from [[Kotelnikovo]] towards the Aksai river but became bogged down {{convert|65|km|mi|abbr=on}} short of its goal. To divert the rescue attempt, the Red Army decided to smash the Italians and come down behind the relief attempt if they could; that operation starting on 16 December. What it did accomplish was to destroy many of the aircraft that had been transporting relief supplies to Stalingrad. The fairly limited scope of the Soviet offensive, although still eventually targeted on Rostov, also allowed Hitler time to see sense and pull Army Group A out of the Caucasus and back over the Don.<ref>Shirer (1990), p.927\u2013928</ref>\n\nOn 31 January 1943, the 90,000 survivors of the 300,000-man 6th Army surrendered. By that time the Hungarian 2nd Army had also been wiped out. The Red Army advanced from the Don {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the west of Stalingrad, marching through Kursk (retaken on 8 February 1943) and Kharkov (retaken 16 February 1943). To save the position in the south, the Germans decided to abandon the Rzhev salient in February, freeing enough troops to make a successful [[riposte]] in eastern Ukraine. [[Manstein]]'s counteroffensive, strengthened by a specially trained [[II SS Panzer Corps|SS Panzer Corps]] equipped with [[Tiger I|Tiger tanks]], opened on 20 February 1943 and fought its way from [[Poltava]] [[Third Battle of Kharkov|back into Kharkov]] in the third week of March, when the spring thaw intervened.This left a glaring Soviet bulge ([[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|salient]]) in the front centered on Kursk.\n\n===Kursk: Summer 1943===\n{{Main|Battle of Kursk}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}\n[[File:RIAN archive 997 Soldiers and a gun on the road.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Soviet soldiers and 45mm gun on the road, 1 August 1943]]\n[[File:Eastern Front 1943-02 to 1943-08.png|thumb|German advances at [[Third Battle of Kharkov|Kharkov]] and [[Battle of Kursk|Kursk]], 19 February 1943 to 1 August 1943:\n{{legend|#ffd2b9|to 18 March 1943}}\n{{legend|#ccffcd|to 1 August 1943}}]]\n\nAfter the failure of the attempt to capture Stalingrad, Hitler had delegated planning authority for the upcoming campaign season to the [[German Army High Command]] and reinstated [[Heinz Guderian]] to a prominent role, this time as Inspector of Panzer Troops. Debate among the General Staff was polarised, with even Hitler nervous about any attempt to pinch off the Kursk salient. He knew that in the intervening six months the Soviet position at Kursk had been reinforced heavily with [[anti-tank]] guns, [[tank trap]]s, [[land mine|landmines]], [[barbed wire]], [[trench warfare|trenches]], [[Bunker#Pillbox|pillboxes]], [[artillery]] and [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]].<ref name=\"Mastny 1365\u20131388\">{{cite journal\n | last =Mastny\n | first =Vojtech\n | author-link =Vojtech Mastny\n | title =Stalin and the Prospects of a Separate Peace in World War II\n | journal =[[The American Historical Review]]\n | volume =77\n | issue =5\n | pages =1365\u20131388\n | date =December 1972\n | url =https://archive.org/details/MastnystalinAndProspectsOfSeparatePeaceInWorld\n | jstor =1861311\n  | doi =10.2307/1861311\n }}</ref>\n\nHowever, if one last great ''[[blitzkrieg]]'' offensive could be mounted, then attention could then be turned to the Allied threat to the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]]. Certainly, the peace negotiations in April had gone nowhere.<ref name=\"Mastny 1365\u20131388\"/> The advance would be executed from the Orel salient to the north of Kursk and from [[Belgorod]] to the south. Both wings would converge on the area east of Kursk, and by that means restore the lines of [[Army Group South]] to the exact points that it held over the winter of 1941\u20131942.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101III-Merz-014-12A, Russland, Beginn Unternehmen Zitadelle, Panzer.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Prokhorovka]] was one of the largest tank battles ever fought. It was part of the wider [[Battle of Kursk]].|alt=]]\n\nIn the north, the entire [[9th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 9th Army]] had been redeployed from the Rzhev salient into the Orel salient and was to advance from Maloarkhangelsk to Kursk. But its forces could not even get past the first objective at [[Olkhovatka]], just {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} into the advance. The 9th Army blunted its spearhead against the Soviet [[land mine|minefields]], frustratingly so considering that the high ground there was the only natural barrier between them and flat tank country all the way to Kursk. The direction of advance was then switched to [[Ponyri]], to the west of Olkhovatka, but the 9th Army could not break through here either and went over to the defensive. The Red Army then launched a counter-offensive, [[Operation Kutuzov]].\n\nOn 12 July the Red Army battled through the demarcation line between the 211th and 293rd divisions on the [[Zhizdra River]] and steamed towards [[Karachev]], right behind them and behind Orel. The southern offensive, spearheaded by [[German 4th Panzer Army|4th Panzer Army]], led by Gen. Col. [[Hermann Hoth|Hoth]], with three Tank Corps made more headway. Advancing on either side of the upper Donets on a narrow corridor, the [[II SS Panzer Corps]] and the [[Grossdeutschland Division|Gro\u00dfdeutschland Panzergrenadier divisions]] battled their way through minefields and over comparatively high ground towards [[Oboyan]]. Stiff resistance caused a change of direction from east to west of the front, but the tanks got {{convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on}} before encountering the reserves of the [[Soviet 5th Guards Tank Army]] outside [[Prokhorovka]]. Battle was joined on 12 July, with about one thousand tanks being engaged.\n\nAfter the war, the battle near Prochorovka was idealised by Soviet [[historian]]s as the largest tank battle of all time. The [[meeting engagement]] at Prochorovka was a Soviet defensive success, albeit at heavy cost. The Soviet 5th Guards Tank Army, with about 800 light and medium tanks, attacked elements of the II SS Panzer Corps. Tank losses on both sides have been the source of controversy ever since. Although the 5th Guards Tank Army did not attain its objectives, the German advance had been halted.\n\nAt the end of the day both sides had fought each other to a standstill, but regardless of the German failure in the north [[Erich von Manstein]] proposed he continue the attack with the 4th Panzer Army. The Red Army started the strong offensive operation in the northern Orel salient and achieved a breakthrough on the flank of the German 9th Army. Also worried by the Allies' [[Operation Husky|landing in Sicily]] on 10 July, Hitler made the decision to halt the offensive even as the German 9th Army was rapidly giving ground in the north. The Germans' final strategic offensive in the Soviet Union ended with their defence against a major Soviet counteroffensive that lasted into August.\n\nThe Kursk offensive was the last on the scale of 1940 and 1941 that the ''Wehrmacht'' was able to launch; subsequent offensives would represent only a shadow of previous German offensive might.\n\n===Autumn and Winter 1943\u201344===\n{{Main|Battle of the Korsun\u2013Cherkassy Pocket|Battle of Smolensk (1943)|Lower Dnieper Offensive|Dnieper-Carpathian Offensive|Leningrad\u2013Novgorod Offensive|Battle of Narva (1944)}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2015}}\n[[File:BM 13 TBiU 7.jpg|thumb|upright|\"[[Katyusha rocket launcher|Katyusha]]\" \u2013 a notable Soviet rocket launcher]]\nThe Soviet multi-stage summer offensive started with the advance into the Orel salient. The diversion of the well-equipped ''Gro\u00dfdeutschland Division'' from Belgorod to Karachev could not counteract it, and the Wehrmacht began a withdrawal from Orel (retaken by the Red Army on 5 August 1943), falling back to the Hagen line in front of [[Bryansk]]. To the south, the Red Army broke through Army Group South's Belgorod positions and headed for Kharkov once again. Although intense battles of movement throughout late July and into August 1943 saw the [[Tiger I|Tigers]] blunting Soviet tank attacks on one axis, they were soon outflanked on another line to the west as the Soviet forces advanced down the [[Olshanka|Psel]], and Kharkov was abandoned for the final time on 22 August.\n\nThe German forces on the [[Mius]], now comprising the 1st Panzer Army and a reconstituted 6th Army, were by August too weak to repulse a Soviet attack on their own front, and when the Red Army hit them they retreated all the way through the [[Donbass]] industrial region to the Dnieper, losing half the farmland that Germany had invaded the Soviet Union to exploit. At this time Hitler agreed to a general withdrawal to the Dnieper line, along which was meant to be the ''Ostwall'', a line of defence similar to the [[Westwall#Reactivation of the Siegfried Line, 1944|Westwall]] (Siegfried Line) of fortifications along the German frontier in the west.\n\nThe main problem for the Wehrmacht was that these defences had not yet been built; by the time Army Group South had evacuated eastern Ukraine and begun withdrawing across the Dnieper during September, the Soviet forces were hard behind them. Tenaciously, small units paddled their way across the {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide river and established [[bridgehead]]s. A second attempt by the Red Army to gain land using parachutists, mounted at [[Kaniv]] on 24 September, proved as disappointing as at Dorogobuzh eighteen months previously. The paratroopers were soon repelled \u2013 but not until still more Red Army troops had used the cover they provided to get themselves over the Dnieper and securely dug in.\n\n[[File:Roza Shanina.jpg|thumb|upright|Soviet sniper [[Roza Shanina]] in 1944.

Important Dnieper towns started to fall, with [[Zaporozhye]] the first to go, followed by [[Dnepropetrovsk]]. Finally, early in November the Red Army broke out of its bridgeheads on either side of Kiev and captured the Ukrainian capital, at that time the third largest city in the Soviet Union.\n\nEighty miles west of Kiev, the 4th Panzer Army, still convinced that the Red Army was a spent force, was able to mount a successful riposte at [[Zhytomyr]] during the middle of November, weakening the Soviet bridgehead by a daring outflanking strike mounted by the SS Panzer Corps along the river Teterev. This battle also enabled Army Group South to recapture Korosten and gain some time to rest. However, on [[Christmas Eve]] the retreat began anew when the First Ukrainian Front (renamed from the Voronezh Front) struck them in the same place. The Soviet advance continued along the railway line until the 1939 Polish\u2013Soviet border was reached on 3 January 1944.\n\nTo the south, the Second Ukrainian Front (ex [[Steppe Front]]) had crossed the Dnieper at [[Kremenchug]] and continued westwards. In the second week of January 1944 they swung north, meeting Vatutin's tank forces which had swung south from their penetration into Poland and surrounding ten German divisions at Korsun\u2013Shevchenkovsky, west of [[Korsun\u2013Shevchenkovsky Offensive|Cherkassy]]. Hitler's insistence on holding the Dnieper line, even when facing the prospect of catastrophic defeat, was compounded by his conviction that the Cherkassy pocket could break out and even advance to Kiev, but Manstein was more concerned about being able to advance to the edge of the pocket and then implore the surrounded forces to break out.\n\nBy 16 February the first stage was complete, with panzers separated from the contracting Cherkassy pocket only by the swollen Gniloy Tikich river. Under shellfire and pursued by Soviet tanks, the surrounded German troops, among whom were the [[SS Division (motorised) Wiking|5th SS Panzer Division ''Wiking'']], fought their way across the river to safety, although at the cost of half their number and all their equipment. They assumed the Red Army would not attack again, with the spring approaching, but on 3 March the Soviet Ukrainian Front went over to the offensive. Having already isolated the Crimea by severing the [[Isthmus of Perekop|Perekop isthmus]], Malinovsky's forces advanced across the mud to the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian]] border, not stopping on the river [[Prut]].\n\n[[File:Eastern Front 1943-08 to 1944-12.png|thumb|Soviet advances from 1 August 1943 to 31 December 1944: {{legend|#fff8d5|to 1 December 1943}} {{legend|#ffd2b9|to 30 April 1944}} {{legend|#ebd7ff|to 19 August 1944}} {{legend|#ccffcd|to 31 December 1944}}]]\nOne final move in the south completed the 1943\u201344 campaigning season, which had wrapped up a Soviet advance of over 500 miles. In March, 20 German divisions of ''[[Generaloberst]]'' [[Hans-Valentin Hube]]'s [[1st Panzer Army]] were encircled in what was to be known as [[Kamenets-Podolsky pocket|Hube's Pocket]] near Kamenets-Podolskiy. After two weeks' of heavy fighting, the 1st Panzer managed to escape the pocket, at the cost of losing almost the entire heavy equipment. At this point, Hitler sacked several prominent generals, Manstein included. In April, the Red Army took back [[Odessa]], followed by 4th Ukrainian Front's campaign to restore control over the Crimea, which culminated in the capture of [[Sevastopol]] on 10 May.\n\nAlong Army Group Centre's front, August 1943 saw this force pushed back from the Hagen line slowly, ceding comparatively little territory, but the loss of Bryansk, and more importantly Smolensk, on 25 September cost the ''Wehrmacht'' the keystone of the entire German defensive system. The 4th and 9th armies and 3rd Panzer Army still held their own east of the upper Dnieper, stifling Soviet attempts to reach Vitebsk. On Army Group North's front, there was barely any fighting at all until January 1944, when out of nowhere Volkhov and Second Baltic Fronts struck.<ref name=\"glantz\"/>\n\nIn a lightning campaign, the Germans were pushed back from Leningrad and [[Novgorod]] was captured by Soviet forces. After a 75-mile advance in January and February, the Leningrad Front had reached the borders of Estonia.

Accordingly, they stripped troops from Army Group Centre, whose front still protruded deep into the Soviet Union. The Germans had transferred some units to France to counter the [[invasion of Normandy]] two weeks before. The Belorussian Offensive (codenamed [[Operation Bagration]]), which was agreed upon by Allies at the [[Tehran Conference]] in December 1943 and launched on 22 June 1944, was a massive Soviet attack, consisting of four Soviet army groups totalling over 120 divisions that smashed into a thinly held German line.\n\nThey focused their massive attacks on Army Group Centre, not Army Group North Ukraine as the Germans had originally expected. More than 2.3 million Soviet troops went into action against German Army Group Centre, which had a strength of fewer than 800,000 men. At the points of attack, the numerical and quality advantages of the Soviet forces were overwhelming. The Red Army achieved a ratio of ten to one in tanks and seven to one in aircraft over their enemy. The Germans crumbled. The capital of [[Belarus]], [[Minsk]], was taken on 3 July, trapping some 100,000 Germans. Ten days later the Red Army reached the prewar Polish border. ''Bagration'' was, by any measure, one of the largest single operations of the war.\n\nBy the end of August 1944, it had cost the Germans ~400,000 dead, wounded, missing and sick, from whom 160,000 were captured, as well as 2,000 tanks and 57,000 other vehicles.

Three armies were pitted there against the Finns, among them several experienced guards rifle formations.

The Soviets outnumbered the Germans on average by 5\u20136:1 in troops, 6:1 in artillery, 6:1 in tanks and 4:1 in [[self-propelled artillery]]. After four days the Red Army broke out and started moving thirty to forty kilometres a day, taking the Baltic states, [[Danzig]], [[East Prussia]], [[Pozna\u0144]], and drawing up on a line sixty kilometres east of [[Berlin]] along the River [[Oder]].

The [[East Prussian Offensive|East Prussian operation]], though often overshadowed by the Vistula\u2013Oder operation and the later battle for Berlin, was in fact one of the largest and costliest operations fought by the Red Army throughout the war. During the period it lasted (13 January \u2013 25 April), it cost the Red Army 584,788 casualties, and 3,525 tanks and assault guns.\n\nThe fall of K\u00f6nigsberg allowed Stavka to free up General [[Konstantin Rokossovsky]]'s [[2nd Belorussian Front]] (2BF) to move west to the east bank of the Oder. During the first two weeks of April, the Red Army performed their fastest front redeployment of the war. General [[Georgy Zhukov]] concentrated his [[1st Belorussian Front]] (1BF), which had been deployed along the Oder river from [[Frankfurt an der Oder|Frankfurt]] in the south to the Baltic, into an area in front of the [[Seelow Heights]]. The 2BF moved into the positions being vacated by the 1BF north of the Seelow Heights. While this redeployment was in progress, gaps were left in the lines and the remnants of the German 2nd Army, which had been bottled up in a pocket near Danzig, managed to escape across the Oder.

But the over-riding objective was to capture Berlin. The two were complementary because possession of the zone could not be won quickly unless Berlin was taken.

The distinctly brutal nature of warfare on the Eastern Front was exemplified by an often wilful disregard for human life by both sides.

Stalin and Hitler both disregarded human life in order to achieve their goal of victory. This included the terrorisation of their own people, as well as [[mass deportation]]s of entire populations. All these factors resulted in tremendous brutality both to combatants and civilians that found no parallel on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]].

Behind the front lines, [[wikt:atrocity|atrocities]] against civilians in German-occupied areas were routine, including those carried out as part of the Holocaust. German and German-allied forces treated civilian populations with exceptional brutality, massacring whole village populations and routinely killing civilian hostages (see [[German war crimes]]). Both sides practised widespread [[scorched earth]] tactics, but the loss of civilian lives in the case of Germany was incomparably smaller than that of the Soviet Union, in which at least 20 million were killed. According to British historian [[Geoffrey Hosking]], \"The full demographic loss to the Soviet peoples was even greater: since a high proportion of those killed were young men of child-begetting age, the postwar Soviet population was 45 to 50 million smaller than post-1939 projections would have led one to expect.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Hosking|first=Geoffrey A.|title=Rulers and Victims: The Russians in the Soviet Union|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CDMVMqDvp4QC&pg=PA242|year=2006|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02178-5|page=242}}</ref>\n\nWhen the Red Army invaded Germany in 1944, many German civilians suffered from reprisals by Red Army soldiers (see [[Soviet war crimes]]). After the war, following the [[Yalta conference]] agreements between the Allies, the [[German people|German populations]] of [[East Prussia]] and [[Silesia]] were [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944\u20131950)|displaced to the west]] of the [[Oder\u2013Neisse line]], in what became one of the largest [[forced migration]]s of people in world history.\n\nThe Soviet Union came out of World War II militarily victorious but economically and structurally devastated. Much of the combat took place in or close to populated areas, and the actions of both sides contributed to massive loss of civilian life and tremendous material damage. According to a summary, presented by Lieutenant General [[Roman Rudenko]] at the [[Nuremberg Trials|International Military Tribunal]] in [[Nuremberg]], the property damage in the Soviet Union inflicted by the Axis invasion was estimated to a value of 679 billion rubles. The largest number of civilian deaths in a single city was 1.2 million citizens dead during the [[Siege of Leningrad]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''[[The New York Times]]'', 9 February 1946, Volume 95, Number 32158.</ref>\n\nThe combined damage consisted of complete or partial destruction of 1,710 cities and towns, 70,000 villages/hamlets, 2,508 church buildings, 31,850 industrial establishments, 40,000 miles of railroad, 4,100 railroad stations, 40,000 hospitals, 84,000 schools, and 43,000 public libraries; leaving 25 million homeless. Seven million horses, 17 million cattle, 20 million pigs, 27 million sheep were also slaughtered or driven off.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Wild fauna were also affected. Wolves and foxes fleeing westward from the killing zone, as the Soviet army advanced between 1943 and 1945, were responsible for a [[rabies]] epidemic that spread slowly westwards, reaching the coast of the [[English Channel]] by 1968.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bellamy|2007|pp=1\u20132}}</ref>\n\n==Leadership==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}\nThe Soviet Union and Nazi Germany were both ideologically driven states (by [[Soviet communism]] and by [[Nazism]] respectively), in which the foremost political [[leader]]s had [[Totalitarianism|near-absolute power]]. The character of the war was thus determined by the political leaders and their [[ideology]] to a much greater extent than in any other theatre of World War II.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n===Adolf Hitler===\n{{Main|Adolf Hitler}}\n[[File:Adolf Hitler cropped restored.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Adolf Hitler]] led Germany during World War II.]]\n\nAdolf Hitler exercised tight control over the German war-effort, spending much of his time in his command bunkers (most notably at [[Rastenburg]] in [[East Prussia]], at [[Vinnitsa]] in [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukraine]], and under the garden of the [[Reich Chancellery]] in [[Berlin]]). At crucial periods in the war he held daily situation-conferences at which he used his remarkable talent for public speaking to overwhelm opposition from his generals and from the OKW staff with rhetoric.\n\nIn part because of the unexpected degree of German success in the Battle of France (despite the warnings of the professional military) Hitler believed himself a military genius, with a grasp of the total war-effort that eluded his generals. In August 1941, when [[Walther von Brauchitsch]] (commander-in-chief of the ''Wehrmacht'') and [[Fedor von Bock]] appealed for an attack on Moscow, Hitler instead ordered the encirclement and capture of Ukraine, in order to acquire the farmland, industry, and natural resources of that country. Some historians like Bevin Alexander in ''How Hitler Could Have Won'' regard this decision as a missed opportunity to win the war.\n\nIn the winter of 1941\u20131942 Hitler believed that his obstinate refusal to allow the German armies to retreat had saved Army Group Centre from collapse. He later told [[Erhard Milch]]:\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B24543, Hauptquartier Heeresgruppe S\u00fcd, Lagebesprechung.jpg|thumb|Hitler with generals [[Friedrich Paulus]], [[Adolf Heusinger]] and [[Fedor von Bock]] in Poltawa, German-occupied Ukraine, June 1942]]\n\n<blockquote>\nI had to act ruthlessly. I had to send even my closest generals packing, two army generals, for example \u2026 I could only tell these gentlemen, \"Get yourself back to Germany as rapidly as you can \u2013 but leave the army in my charge. And the army is staying at the front.\"\n</blockquote>\n\nThe success of this [[hedgehog defence]] outside Moscow led Hitler to insist on the holding of territory when it made no military sense, and to sack generals who retreated without orders. Officers with initiative were replaced with yes-men or with fanatical Nazis. The disastrous encirclements later in the war \u2013 at [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]], [[Korsun\u2013Cherkassy Pocket|Korsun]] and many other places \u2013 resulted directly from Hitler's orders. This idea of holding territory led to another failed plan, dubbed{{by whom|date=May 2018}} \"''Heaven-bound Missions''\", which involved fortifying even the most unimportant or insignificant of cities and the holding of these \"fortresses\" at all costs. Many divisions became cut off in \"fortress\" cities, or wasted uselessly in secondary theatres, because Hitler would not sanction retreat or voluntarily abandon any of his conquests.\n\nFrustration at Hitler's [[leadership]] in the war was one of the factors in the attempted [[coup d'etat]] of 1944, but after the failure of the [[20 July Plot]] Hitler considered the army and its officer corps suspect and came to rely on the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) and Nazi party members to prosecute the war.\n\nHitler's direction of the war ultimately proved disastrous for the German Army, though the skill, loyalty, professionalism and endurance of officers and soldiers enabled him to keep Germany fighting to the end. [[F. W. Winterbotham]] wrote of Hitler's signal to [[Gerd von Rundstedt]] to continue the attack to the west during the [[Battle of the Bulge]]:\n\n{{quote|From experience we had learned that when Hitler started refusing to do what the generals recommended, things started to go wrong, and this was to be no exception.}}\n\n===Joseph Stalin===\n{{Main|Joseph Stalin}}\n[[File:CroppedStalin1943.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Stalin]] led the Soviet Union during World War II.]]\n\nJoseph Stalin bore the greatest responsibility for some of the disasters at the beginning of the war (for example, the [[Battle of Kiev (1941)]]), but equally deserves praise for the subsequent success of the Soviet [[Red Army]], which depended on the unprecedentedly [[History of the Soviet Union (1927\u20131953)|rapid industrialisation of the Soviet Union]], which Stalin's internal policy had made the first priority throughout the 1930s.\nStalin's [[Great Purge]] of the Red Army in the late 1930s involved the legal prosecution of many of the senior command, many of whom the courts convicted and sentenced to death or to imprisonment.\n\nThe executed included [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]], a proponent of armoured [[blitzkrieg]]. Stalin promoted some [[obscurantist]]s like [[Grigory Kulik]] who opposed the mechanisation of the army and the production of tanks, but on the other hand purged the older commanders who had held their positions since the [[Russian Civil War]] of 1917\u20131922, and who had experience, but were deemed \"politically unreliable\". This opened up their places to the promotion of many younger officers that Stalin and the [[NKVD]] regarded as in line with [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] politics. Many{{quantify|date=May 2018}} of these newly promoted commanders proved terribly inexperienced, but some later became very successful. Soviet tank-output remained the largest in the world.\n\nFrom the foundation of the Red Army in 1918, political distrust of the military had led to a system of \"dual command\", with every commander paired with a [[political commissar]], a member of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. Larger units had military councils consisting of the commander, commissar and chief of staff \u2013 commissars ensured the loyalty of the commanding officers and implemented Party orders.\n\nFollowing the [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|Soviet occupation of eastern Poland]], of the [[Occupation and annexation of the Baltic states by the Soviet Union (1940)|Baltic states]] and of [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina]] in 1939\u20131940, Stalin insisted on the occupation of every fold of the newly Sovietized territories; this move westward positioned troops far from their depots, in salients that left them vulnerable to encirclement. As tension heightened in spring, 1941, Stalin desperately tried not to give Hitler any provocation that Berlin could use as an excuse for a German attack; Stalin refused to allow the military to go on the alert \u2013 even as German troops gathered on the borders and German reconnaissance planes overflew installations. This refusal to take necessary action was instrumental in the destruction of major portions of the Red Air Force, lined up on its airfields, in the first days of the German-Soviet war.\n\nAt the crisis of the war, in the autumn of 1942, Stalin made many concessions to the army: the government restored unitary command by removing the Commissars from the [[chain of command]]. Order 25 of 15 January 1943 introduced [[Shoulder mark|shoulderboards]] for all ranks; this represented a significant symbolic step, since after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] shoulderboards had connotations as a symbol of the old Tsarist r\u00e9gime. Beginning in autumn 1941, units that had proved themselves by superior performance in combat were given the traditional \"Guards\" title.{{Sfn | Glantz | 2005 | p = 181}}\n\nThese concessions were combined with ruthless discipline: [[Order No. 227]], issued on 28 July 1942, threatened commanders who retreated without orders with punishment by [[court-martial]]. Infractions by military and ''[[politruk]]s'' were punished with transferral to [[penal battalion]]s and to penal [[Company (military unit)|companies]] which carried out especially hazardous duties, such as serving as ''tramplers'' to clear Nazi minefields.<ref>{{Citation | last = Toppe | first = Alfred | title = Night Combat | publisher = Diane | year = 1998 | isbn = 978-0-7881-7080-5 | page = 28}}</ref> The order stipulated to capture or shoot \"cowards\" and fleeing panicked troops at the rear the blocking detachments in the first three months shot 1,000 penal troops and sent 24,993 to penal battalions.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Stalin's Wars: From World War to Cold War, 1939\u20131953|last=Roberts|first=Geoffrey|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2006|isbn=0-300-11204-1|pages=132}}</ref> By October 1942 the idea of regular blocking detachments was quietly dropped, By 29 October 1944 the units were officially disbanded.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bdsa.ru/%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%B7%D1%8B-%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%BE-%D0%B7%D0%B0-1944-%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%B4/784-636|title=\u041f\u0420\u0418\u041a\u0410\u0417 \u041e \u0420\u0410\u0421\u0424\u041e\u0420\u041c\u0418\u0420\u041e\u0412\u0410\u041d\u0418\u0418 \u041e\u0422\u0414\u0415\u041b\u042c\u041d\u042b\u0425 \u0417\u0410\u0413\u0420\u0410\u0414\u0418\u0422\u0415\u041b\u042c\u041d\u042b\u0425 \u041e\u0422\u0420\u042f\u0414\u041e\u0412|website=bdsa.ru|access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Ivan's War: Life and Death in the Red Army|last=Merridale|first=Catherine|publisher=New York : Metropolitan Books|year=2006|isbn=0-8050-7455-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/ivanswarlifedeat00merr_0/page/158 158]|oclc=60671899|url=https://archive.org/details/ivanswarlifedeat00merr_0/page/158}}</ref>\n\nAs it became clear that the Soviet Union would win the war, Stalin ensured that propaganda always mentioned his leadership of the war; he sidelined the victorious generals and never allowed them to develop into political rivals. After the war the Soviets once again purged the Red Army (though not as brutally as in the 1930s) and demoted many successful officers (including [[Georgy Zhukov|Zhukov]], [[Rodion Malinovsky|Malinovsky]] and [[Ivan Koniev|Koniev]]) to unimportant positions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n==Repression in occupied states==\n{{See also|Generalplan Ost|Nazi crimes against Soviet POWs|German war crimes against Soviet civilians|Commissar Order|Hunger Plan|Soviet war crimes}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2015}}\n<!-- Commented out: [[File:Einsatzgruppen Killing.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A member of ''[[Einsatzgruppe]] D'' murders a Jew who is kneeling before a filled mass grave in [[Vinnitsa]], in 1942.

For the majority of people of the Soviet Union, the Nazi invasion was viewed as a brutal act of unprovoked aggression. While it is important to note that not all parts of Soviet society viewed the German advance in this way, the majority of the Soviet population viewed German forces as occupiers. In areas such as [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], and [[Lithuania]] (which had been annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940) the ''Wehrmacht'' was tolerated by a relatively more significant part of the native population.\n\nThis was particularly true for the territories of Western Ukraine, recently rejoined to the Soviet Union, where the anti-Polish and anti-Soviet [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|Ukrainian nationalist underground]] hoped in vain to establish the \"independent state\", relying on German armed force. However, Soviet society as a whole was hostile to the invading Nazis from the very start. The nascent national liberation movements among Ukrainians and [[Cossack]]s, and others were viewed by Hitler with suspicion; some, especially those from the Baltic States, were co-opted into the Axis armies and others brutally suppressed. None of the conquered territories gained any measure of self-rule.\n\nInstead, the [[Nazism|Nazi ideologues]] saw the future of the East as one of settlement by German colonists, with the natives killed, expelled, or reduced to slave labour. The cruel and brutally inhumane treatment of Soviet civilians, women, children and elderly, the daily bombings of civilian cities and towns, Nazi pillaging of Soviet villages and hamlets and unprecedented harsh punishment and treatment of civilians in general were some of the primary reasons for Soviet resistance to Nazi Germany's invasion. Indeed, the Soviets viewed Germany's invasion as an act of aggression and an attempt to conquer and enslave the local population.\n\n[[File:Einsatzgruppen murder Jews in Ivanhorod, Ukraine, 1942.jpg|link=Ivanhorod Einsatzgruppen photograph, 1942|thumb|[[Ivanhorod Einsatzgruppen photograph|Einsatzgruppen murdering Jews]] in [[Ivanhorod]], Ukraine, 1942]]\nRegions closer to the front were managed by military powers of the region, in other areas such as the Baltic states annexed by the USSR in 1940, Reichscommissariats were established. As a rule, the maximum in loot was extracted. In September 1941, [[Erich Koch]] was appointed to the Ukrainian Commissariat. His opening speech was clear about German policy: \"I am known as a brutal dog ... Our job is to suck from Ukraine all the goods we can get hold of ... I am expecting from you the utmost severity towards the native population.\"\n\nAtrocities against the Jewish population in the conquered areas began almost immediately, with the dispatch of ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' (task groups) to round up Jews and shoot them.<ref>[http://www1.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/barbarossa/ Marking 70 Years to Operation Barbarossa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916093736/http://www1.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/barbarossa/ |date=16 September 2012 }} on the [[Yad Vashem]] website</ref>\n\nThe massacres of Jews and other [[Ethnic minority|ethnic minorities]] were only a part of the deaths from the Nazi occupation. Many hundreds of thousands of Soviet civilians were executed, and millions more died from [[starvation]] as the Germans requisitioned food for their armies and fodder for their draft horses. As they retreated from Ukraine and Belarus in 1943\u201344, the German occupiers systematically applied a [[scorched earth]] policy, burning towns and cities, destroying infrastructure, and leaving civilians to starve or die of exposure.<ref>On 7 September 1943, [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]] sent orders to [[HSSPF]] \"Ukraine\" [[Hans-Adolf Pr\u00fctzmann]] that \"not a human being, not a single head of cattle, not a hundredweight of cereals and not a railway line remain behind; that not a house remains standing, not a mine is available which is not destroyed for years to come, that there is not a well which is not poisoned. The enemy must really find completely burned and destroyed land\". He ordered cooperation with Infantry general Staff, also someone named Stampf, and sent copies to the Chief of Regular Police, Chief of Security Police & SS, [[SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]] Berger, and the chief of the partisan combating units. See ''Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression, Supplement A'' pg 1270.</ref> In many towns, the battles were fought within towns and cities with trapped civilians caught in the middle. Estimates of total civilian dead in the Soviet Union in the war range from seven million (''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'') to seventeen million (Richard Overy).\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-031-2436-03A, Russland, Hinrichtung von Partisanen.jpg|thumb|[[Soviet partisans]] hanged by German forces in January 1943]]\nThe Nazi ideology and the maltreatment of the local population and Soviet POWs encouraged [[Partisan (military)|partisans]] fighting behind the front; it motivated even anti-communists or non-Russian nationalists to ally with the Soviets and greatly delayed the formation of German-allied divisions consisting of Soviet POWs (see [[Vlasov army]]). These results and missed opportunities contributed to the defeat of the ''Wehrmacht''.\n\nVadim Erlikman has detailed Soviet losses totalling 26.5 million war related deaths. Military losses of 10.6 million include six million killed or missing in action and 3.6 million POW dead, plus 400,000 paramilitary and [[Soviet partisans|Soviet partisan]] losses. Civilian deaths totalled 15.9 million, which included 1.5 million from military actions; 7.1 million victims of Nazi [[genocide]] and reprisals; 1.8 million deported to Germany for [[forced labour]]; and 5.5 million [[famine]] and [[disease]] deaths. Additional famine deaths, which totalled one million during 1946\u201347, are not included here. These losses are for the entire territory of the USSR including territories annexed in 1939\u201340.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\n[[File:Lost children russia about 1942.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Homeless]] Russian children in occupied territory (about 1942)]]\n[[Belarus]] lost a quarter of its pre-war population, including practically all its intellectual elite.

Stalin's [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|five-year plans]] of the 1930s had resulted in the industrialisation of the Urals and central Asia. In 1941, thousands of trains evacuated critical factories and workers from Belarus and Ukraine to safe areas far from the front lines. Once these facilities were reassembled east of the Urals, production could be resumed without fear of German bombing.\n\nAs the Soviet Union's manpower reserves ran low from 1943 onwards, the great Soviet offensives had to depend more on equipment and less on the expenditure of lives.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} The increases in production of [[materiel]] were achieved at the expense of civilian living standards \u2013 the most thorough application of the principle of [[total war]] \u2013 and with the help of [[Lend-Lease]] supplies from the United Kingdom and the United States. The Germans, on the other hand, could rely on a large slave workforce from the conquered countries and Soviet POWs. American exports and technical expertise also enabled the Soviets to produce goods that they wouldn't have been able to on their own. For example, while the USSR was able to produce fuel of octane numbers from 70 to 74, Soviet industry only met 4% of demand for fuel of octane numbers from 90+; all aircraft produced after 1939 required fuel of the latter category. To fulfill demands, the USSR depended on American assistance, both in finished products and TEL.<ref>Alexander Matveichuk.

Consumption on all fronts during the same period was 1.493 million tons of explosives and 626,887 tons of powder.<ref>US Strategic Bombing Survey \"Appendix D.

The Soviets incrementally upgraded existing designs, and simplified and refined manufacturing processes to increase production, and were helped by a mass infusion of harder to produce goods such as aviation fuel, machine tools, trucks, and high-explosives from Lend-Lease, allowing them to concentrate on a few key industries. Meanwhile, Germany had been cut off from foreign trade for years by the time it invaded the USSR, was in the middle of two extended and costly theatres at air and sea that further limited production ([[Battle of the Atlantic]] and [[Defence of the Reich]]), and was forced to devote a large segment of its expenditures to goods the Soviets could cut back on (such as trucks) or which would never even be used against the Soviets (such as ships). Naval vessels alone constituted 10\u201315% of Germany's war expenditures from 1940 to 1944 depending on the year, while armoured vehicles by comparison were only 5\u20138%.<ref>Military Analysis Division, U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey- European War, Volume 3, page 144.

In the course of the war the US supplied $11 billion of materiel through Lend-Lease. This included 400,000 trucks, 12,000 armoured vehicles (including 7,000 tanks), 11,400 aircraft and 1.75 million tons of food.<ref>[http://www.history.army.mil/books/AMH-V2/PDF/Chapter05.pdf ''World War II The War Against Germany And Italy''], US Army Center of Military History, page 158.</ref> The British supplied aircraft including 3,000 Hurricanes and 4,000 other aircraft during the war.

According to the [[Narkomat]] of Defence order (No. 023, 4 February 1944), the irretrievable casualties include killed, missing, those who died due to war-time or subsequent wounds, maladies and [[chilblain]]s and those who were captured.\n\nThe huge death toll was attributed to several factors, including brutal mistreatment of POWs and captured partisans, the large deficiency of food and medical supplies in Soviet territories, and atrocities committed mostly by the Germans against the civilian population. The multiple battles and the use of [[scorched earth]] tactics destroyed [[Agriculture|agricultural land]], infrastructure, and whole towns, leaving much of the population homeless and without food.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Military losses on the Eastern Front during World War II<ref>R\u00fcdiger Overmans, ''Deutsche milit\u00e4rische Verluste im Zweiten Weltkrieg''.

To date, several fully reusable [[suborbital]] systems and partially reusable [[orbital spaceflight|orbital]] systems have been flown.\n\nThe first reusable launch vehicle to reach orbit was the [[Space Shuttle]], which was not able to accomplish the intended goal of reducing launch costs to below those of [[expendable launch system]]s.

He had two brothers\u2014Santosh and Yuvraj.<ref name=\"TimesIndia\" /> Yadav lived and did business in the slum, which housed some criminals and, according to police, two rival gangs who worked the area. In his book ''Killing Justice: Vigilantism in Nagpur'', author Swati Mehta wrote: \"by all accounts, a child of the neighborhood, Akku had graduated from milkman's son to local menace.\"{{sfn|Mehta|2005|p=1}}\n\n===Crimes===\n\nIn their book ''Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide'', authors Nicholas D. Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn wrote: \"Akku Yadav was, in a sense, the other 'success' of Kasturba Nagar. He was a higher-caste man who had turned an apprenticeship as a small-time thug into a role as a mobster and king of the slum.\"{{sfn|Kristof|WuDunn|2009|p=49}} Yadav ruled a gang of criminals who controlled the Kasturba Nagar slum. They robbed, tortured, and killed people with impunity. Yadav committed crimes for several years as he created a small business empire. Akku and his gang members often harassed and intimidated people to extort money. Extortion was his main source of income.{{sfn|Stackhouse|Lalsangkima|2007|p=120}} Yadav characteristically threatened to rape anyone who resisted him.{{sfn|Kristof|WuDunn|2009|p=49}} He would hurt people if they did not give him money or if they angered him in any way.{{sfn|Mehta|2005|p=2}} Pratibha Urkude and her husband Dattu ran a small grocery shop and Yadav harassed them for years. He would pick up goods from the shop and refuse to pay or would simply pay much less than was owed. Sometimes he would demand money and become violent if they were unable to pay.{{sfn|Mehta|2005|p=3}} Yadav often worried he was being plotted against. As a result, he did not permit men or women to gather and talk. He made sure young boys did not play together, and if they did, Yadav would break up their games. Suspicious that people were asking questions about him, he would warn people against reporting his crimes to police, threatening them if they did so.{{sfn|Mehta|2005|p=3}} Killing left inconvenient corpses that required him to bribe police to prevent them from stopping his crimes. Rape, however, was very stigmatizing and, as a result, the victims could be relied on to remain silent. Yadav raped people to silence them far more frequently than murdering them. The women who killed Yadav claimed that he had been raping and abusing local women with impunity for over a decade. They alleged that local police had refused to help his victims or pursue charges because Yadav was bribing them.{{sfn|Kristof|WuDunn|2009|p=49}} According to Mehta, Akku Yadav's first crime was a [[gang rape]] in 1991. His other crimes included rape, murder, robbery, extortion, [[home invasion]], assault, and criminal intimidation.{{sfn|Mehta|2005|p=1}} Before his death, Yadav had been arrested some 14&nbsp;times. In late 1999, he was detained for a year under the [[Maharashtra]] preventive detention law\u2014The Maharashtra Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Slumlords, Boot-leggers, Drug Offenders and Dangerous Persons Act 1981.{{sfn|Mehta|2005|p=1}}\n\nYadav allegedly raped so many people that according to residents of the Kasturba Nagar slum, a rape victim lives in every other house there.<ref name=\"guardian\" /> Yadav allegedly raped over 40&nbsp;women;{{sfn|Mehta|2005|p=3}} his youngest victim being a 10-year-old girl.<ref name=Rediff/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Women-proud-of-lynching-goon-in-court/articleshow/815580.cms |title=Women proud of lynching goon in court |work=[[The Times of India]] |date=15 August 2004 |accessdate=3 March 2020}}</ref> One person described Yadav as \"the [[Gabbar Singh (character)|Gabbar Singh]] of Kasturba Nagar\" saying, \"We stayed mostly indoors when Akku was around\". Women have said Yadav and his gang would invade homes any time of the day.<ref name=Furies/> He sometimes wanted a motorcycle or would grab a mobile phone or extort money.<ref name=Furies/> Yadav and his gang members would beat up anyone who resisted them.<ref name=Furies/> He murdered a woman named Asha Bai, a daughter of Anjana Bai Borkar, in front of her 16-year-old granddaughter. Borkar was one of five women arrested for Yadav's [[lynched|lynching]].{{sfn|Stackhouse|Lalsangkima|2007|p=120}} Speaking of Yadav, the granddaughter said: \"We were eating dinner when he came to the front door and pretended to be a friend of my brother. When my mother opened the door, he dragged her out and stabbed her. He then cut off her ears for her earrings and her fingers because he could not get her rings.\"{{sfn|Stackhouse|Lalsangkima|2007|p=120}} Yadav had reportedly murdered at least three people and dumped their bodies on local railroad tracks.<ref name=\"guardian\" /> One woman described how she and her husband were attacked by Yadav. He came to their house at 4:00\u2013&nbsp;AM\u20135:00&nbsp;AM. Yadav knocked aggressively on their door saying he was a police official, and asked them to open it. Once Yadav entered, he stabbed the husband in the thigh with a knife, locked him in the bathroom and dragged the wife by her hair away to a place where he raped her. Yadav allowed her to return after three or four hours.{{sfn|Mehta|2005|p=4}} In January 2004, Yadav was banned from entering Nagpur city.{{sfn|Mehta|2005|p=5}} An elderly man named Harichand Khorse, who earned a small amount of money playing a musical instrument called a baja, was beaten violently by Yadav because he was unable to pay 100 rupees.{{sfn|Mehta|2005|p=5}} According to neighbors in Kasturba Nagar, Yadav once raped a woman right after her wedding.{{sfn|Kristof|WuDunn|2009|p=49}} He also stripped a man naked and burned him with a cigarette, then forced him to dance in front of his 16-year-old daughter.{{sfn|Kristof|WuDunn|2009|p=49}} Yadav took a woman named Asho Bhagat and tortured her in front of her daughter and several neighbors by cutting off her breasts. Yadav then sliced Bhagat into pieces on the street, killing her. A man named Avinash Tiwari, one of the neighbors, was horrified by the murder and planned to report Yadav to the police. As a result, Yadav butchered him.{{sfn|Kristof|WuDunn|2009|p=49}} Yadav and his men gang-raped a woman named Kalma ten days after she gave birth. After what happened to her, Kalma committed suicide; she burned to death after dousing herself with [[kerosene]] and lighting it.{{sfn|Kristof|WuDunn|2009|p=49}} Yadav's gang pulled another woman from her house when she was seven months pregnant. They stripped her naked and raped her on the road in public view.{{sfn|Kristof|WuDunn|2009|p=49}}\n\nYadav ordered his men to drag girls as young as age 12 to a nearby derelict building to gang rape.<ref name=\"guardian\" /> Although admitting to being a rape victim in India was taboo, many of Yadav's victims reported his crimes. Instead of arresting him, the police told him who had reported the crime; Yadav would go after them. The police worked with Yadav, protected him and supported him; he gave them bribes and drinks. When a 22-year-old woman reported being raped by Yadav, the police accused her of having an affair with him and sent her away. Several women were turned away by police after being told: \"You're a loose woman. That's why he raped you.\"<ref name=\"guardian\" /> One woman told the police she was gang-raped by Yadav and his associates. The police responded by gang raping the woman themselves.{{sfn|Kristof|WuDunn|2009|p=50}} Twenty-five families moved out of Kasturba Nagar. [[Dalits]], however, removed their daughters from schools and kept them locked inside their homes where nobody could see them. Vegetable vendors avoided Kasturba Nagar, so housewives had to go to far away markets to buy food. As long as Yadav only targeted Dalits, police would not interfere.{{sfn|Kristof|WuDunn|2009|p=50}}\n\nAfter Yadav raped a 13-year-old girl, he and his men went to the house of a woman named Ratna Dungiri to demand money. The gang smashed her furniture and threatened to murder her family. When a woman named Usha Narayane arrived afterward, she told Dungiri to go to the police. Dungiri refused, so Narayane went to the police herself and filed a complaint. They told Yadav about the complaint. Enraged by her actions, two weeks before he died, Yadav and forty of his associates went to the Narayane house and surrounded it.{{sfn|Kristof|WuDunn|2009|pp=50\u201351}} Yadav carried a bottle of acid and shouted through the door that he would not harm Narayane if she withdrew the complaint. Narayane barricaded the door and refused to surrender. She called the police and although she was told they would come, they never arrived.{{sfn|Kristof|WuDunn|2009|pp=50\u201351}} Meanwhile, Yadav continued to pound on the door and threaten her, saying: \"I'll throw acid on your face, and you won't be in a position to file any more complaints! If we ever meet you, you don't know what we'll do to you! Gang rape is nothing! You can't imagine what we'll do to you!\" Narayane shouted back insults, and Yadav responded with descriptions of how he would rape, burn her with acid, and murder her.{{sfn|Kristof|WuDunn|2009|pp=50\u201351}} Yadav and his men tried to break the door down. In response, Narayane turned on a cylinder of gas that the family used for cooking and grabbed a match. She warned that if they broke into the house, she would light the match and blow herself and all of them up. The criminals smelled the gas and left Narayane alone.{{sfn|Kristof|WuDunn|2009|pp=50\u201351}}\n\nThe neighbors heard about what Narayane had done and were now willing to go after Yadav. Soon there were many angry Dalits on the streets, and they started to pick up sticks and stones. People threw stones at Yadav's associates. His men saw the crowd's mood and fled. The Dalits marched through the slum and celebrated. On 6&nbsp;August 2004,<ref name=\"guardian\" /> they went to Yadav's house and burned it down.<ref name=\"NYTimesEnough\" /> Yadav now feared for his life and went to the police for protection; they arrested him for his own protection on 7&nbsp;August 2004.{{sfn|Kristof|WuDunn|2009|p=51}}<ref name=Rediff>{{cite web |url=https://www.rediff.com/news/2004/aug/18nag1.htm |title=Groups support women who killed Yadav |publisher=[[Rediff.com]] |date=August 18, 2004 |accessdate=March 3, 2020}}</ref> Yadav's mother vacated his house.<ref name=Outlook/> On 7&nbsp;August, Yadav was due to appear the city district court and 500 slum residents gathered.

Word spread through the adjoining neighborhood that he would be released. The police planned to keep him in custody until everyone had calmed down and then release him. The bail hearing was supposed to take place miles away in the center of Nagpur. Hundreds of Dalit women marched from the slums to the courthouse carrying vegetable knives and [[chili powder]], walked into the courtroom and took seats near the front. Yadav walked in and was confident and unrepentant. At about 2:30&nbsp;to 3:00&nbsp;PM, when Yadav appeared, he saw a woman he had raped.

German merchants and settlers were active in introducing large scale [[plantation]] operations and developing new industries, notably, cocoa bean and rubber, relying on imported labourers from China and [[Melanesia]]. When the value of natural rubber fell drastically, about the end of the Great War (World War I), the New Zealand government encouraged the production of bananas, for which there is a large market in New Zealand. {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n\nBecause of variations in altitude, a large range of tropical and subtropical crops can be cultivated, but land is not generally available to outside interests. Of the total land area of 2,934&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (725,000 acres), about 24.4% is in permanent crops and another 21.2% is arable. About 4.4% is Western Samoan Trust Estates Corporation (WSTEC). {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\nThe staple products of Samoa are copra (dried coconut meat), [[cocoa bean]] (for chocolate), and bananas. The annual production of both bananas and copra has been in the range of 13,000 to 15,000 metric tons (about 14,500 to 16,500 short tons). If the [[rhinoceros beetle]] in Samoa were eradicated, Samoa could produce in excess of 40,000 metric tons (44,000 short tons) of copra. Samoan cocoa beans are of very high quality and used in fine New Zealand chocolates. Most are [[Criollo (cocoa bean)|Criollo]]-Forastero hybrids. Coffee grows well, but production has been uneven. WSTEC is the biggest coffee producer. Rubber has been produced in Samoa for many years, but its export value has little impact on the economy. {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n\nOther agricultural industries have been less successful. [[Sugarcane]] production, originally established by Germans in the early 20th century, could be successful. Old train tracks for transporting cane can be seen at some plantations east of [[Apia]].

As one of the oldest Polynesian cultures, the fa'asamoa developed over a period of 3,000 years, withstanding centuries of European influence to maintains its historical customs, social and political systems, and [[Samoan language|language]]. Cultural customs such as the [[Samoa 'ava ceremony]] are significant and solemn rituals at important occasions including the bestowal of ''[[fa'amatai|matai]]'' chiefly titles. Items of great cultural value include the finely woven ''[['ie toga]]''.\n\n[[Samoan mythology]] includes many gods with creation stories and figures of legend such as [[Tagaloa]] and the goddess of war [[Nafanua]], the daughter of [[Saveasi'uleo]], ruler of the spirit realm [[Pulotu]]. Other legends include the well known story of [[Sina and the Eel]] which explains the origins of the first coconut tree.\n\nSome Samoans are spiritual and religious, and have subtly adapted the dominant religion of Christianity to 'fit in' with fa'a Samoa and vice versa. Ancient beliefs continue to co-exist side by side with Christianity, particularly in regard to the traditional customs and rituals of fa'a Samoa. The Samoan culture is centred around the principle of v\u0101fealoa'i, the relationships between people. These relationships are based on respect, or [[fa'aaloalo]]. When Christianity was introduced in Samoa, most Samoan people converted. Currently 98% of the population identify themselves as Christian.\n\nSome Samoans live a communal way of life, participating in activities collectively. Examples of this are the traditional Samoan ''[[Architecture of Samoa|fale]]'' (houses) which are open with no walls, using blinds made of coconut palm fronds during the night or bad weather.\n\nThe Samoan ''[[siva Samoa|siva]]'' dance has unique gentle movements of the body in time to music and tells a story, although the Samoan male dances can be more snappy.<ref>{{cite news | title=Dance: Siva | url=http://www.samoa.co.uk/dance.html | work=Samoa.co.uk | access-date=27 November 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117045520/http://www.samoa.co.uk/dance.html | archive-date=17 November 2007 | url-status=dead }}</ref> The ''[[sasa (dance)|sasa]]'' is also a traditional dance where rows of dancers perform rapid [[synchronization|synchronised]] movements in time to the rhythm of wooden drums ''([[pate (musical instrument)|pate]])'' or rolled mats. Another dance performed by males is called the ''[[fa'ataupati]]'' or the slap dance, creating rhythmic sounds by slapping different parts of the body. This is believed to have been derived from slapping insects on the body.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nThe form and construction of traditional [[architecture of Samoa]] was a specialised skill by ''Tufuga fai fale'' that was also linked to other cultural artforms.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Catholic church in Samoa-2.jpg|Roman Catholic [[Immaculate Conception]] of Mary cathedral.\nFile:Siva Afi - Fire spinning.jpg|A Samoan fire dancer.\nFile:Fale on Manono Island.jpg|A [[Architecture of Samoa|fale]] on [[Manono Island]]\nFile:Apia Samoa Temple-new.jpg|LDS [[Apia Samoa Temple]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Tattooing===\n\n[[File:Samoan Malu.jpg|thumb|A Samoan woman with a traditional [[malu]].]]\n\nAs with other Polynesian cultures ([[Hawaiian culture|Hawaiian]], [[Tahitians|Tahitian]] and [[M\u0101ori culture|M\u0101ori]]) with significant and unique tattoos, Samoans have two gender specific and culturally significant tattoos.

When the value of natural rubber fell drastically, about the end of the Great War (World War I), the New Zealand government encouraged the production of bananas, for which there is a large market in New Zealand. {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n\nBecause of variations in altitude, a large range of tropical and subtropical crops can be cultivated, but land is not generally available to outside interests. Of the total land area of 2,934&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (725,000 acres), about 24.4% is in permanent crops and another 21.2% is arable. About 4.4% is Western Samoan Trust Estates Corporation (WSTEC). {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\nThe staple products of Samoa are copra (dried coconut meat), [[cocoa bean]] (for chocolate), and bananas. The annual production of both bananas and copra has been in the range of 13,000 to 15,000 metric tons (about 14,500 to 16,500 short tons). If the [[rhinoceros beetle]] in Samoa were eradicated, Samoa could produce in excess of 40,000 metric tons (44,000 short tons) of copra. Samoan cocoa beans are of very high quality and used in fine New Zealand chocolates. Most are [[Criollo (cocoa bean)|Criollo]]-Forastero hybrids. Coffee grows well, but production has been uneven. WSTEC is the biggest coffee producer. Rubber has been produced in Samoa for many years, but its export value has little impact on the economy. {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n\nOther agricultural industries have been less successful. [[Sugarcane]] production, originally established by Germans in the early 20th century, could be successful. Old train tracks for transporting cane can be seen at some plantations east of [[Apia]]. [[Pineapple]]s grow well in Samoa, but beyond local consumption have not been a major export.\n\nSixty percent of Samoa's electricity comes from renewable hydro, solar, and wind sources, with the remainder from diesel generators.

As one of the oldest Polynesian cultures, the fa'asamoa developed over a period of 3,000 years, withstanding centuries of European influence to maintains its historical customs, social and political systems, and [[Samoan language|language]]. Cultural customs such as the [[Samoa 'ava ceremony]] are significant and solemn rituals at important occasions including the bestowal of ''[[fa'amatai|matai]]'' chiefly titles. Items of great cultural value include the finely woven ''[['ie toga]]''.\n\n[[Samoan mythology]] includes many gods with creation stories and figures of legend such as [[Tagaloa]] and the goddess of war [[Nafanua]], the daughter of [[Saveasi'uleo]], ruler of the spirit realm [[Pulotu]]. Other legends include the well known story of [[Sina and the Eel]] which explains the origins of the first coconut tree.\n\nSome Samoans are spiritual and religious, and have subtly adapted the dominant religion of Christianity to 'fit in' with fa'a Samoa and vice versa. Ancient beliefs continue to co-exist side by side with Christianity, particularly in regard to the traditional customs and rituals of fa'a Samoa. The Samoan culture is centred around the principle of v\u0101fealoa'i, the relationships between people. These relationships are based on respect, or [[fa'aaloalo]]. When Christianity was introduced in Samoa, most Samoan people converted. Currently 98% of the population identify themselves as Christian.\n\nSome Samoans live a communal way of life, participating in activities collectively. Examples of this are the traditional Samoan ''[[Architecture of Samoa|fale]]'' (houses) which are open with no walls, using blinds made of coconut palm fronds during the night or bad weather.\n\nThe Samoan ''[[siva Samoa|siva]]'' dance has unique gentle movements of the body in time to music and tells a story, although the Samoan male dances can be more snappy.<ref>{{cite news | title=Dance: Siva | url=http://www.samoa.co.uk/dance.html | work=Samoa.co.uk | access-date=27 November 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117045520/http://www.samoa.co.uk/dance.html | archive-date=17 November 2007 | url-status=dead }}</ref> The ''[[sasa (dance)|sasa]]'' is also a traditional dance where rows of dancers perform rapid [[synchronization|synchronised]] movements in time to the rhythm of wooden drums ''([[pate (musical instrument)|pate]])'' or rolled mats. Another dance performed by males is called the ''[[fa'ataupati]]'' or the slap dance, creating rhythmic sounds by slapping different parts of the body. This is believed to have been derived from slapping insects on the body.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nThe form and construction of traditional [[architecture of Samoa]] was a specialised skill by ''Tufuga fai fale'' that was also linked to other cultural artforms.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Catholic church in Samoa-2.jpg|Roman Catholic [[Immaculate Conception]] of Mary cathedral.\nFile:Siva Afi - Fire spinning.jpg|A Samoan fire dancer.\nFile:Fale on Manono Island.jpg|A [[Architecture of Samoa|fale]] on [[Manono Island]]\nFile:Apia Samoa Temple-new.jpg|LDS [[Apia Samoa Temple]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Tattooing===\n\n[[File:Samoan Malu.jpg|thumb|A Samoan woman with a traditional [[malu]].]]\n\nAs with other Polynesian cultures ([[Hawaiian culture|Hawaiian]], [[Tahitians|Tahitian]] and [[M\u0101ori culture|M\u0101ori]]) with significant and unique tattoos, Samoans have two gender specific and culturally significant tattoos.
