South Korea experienced serious difficulties during the [[2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak in South Korea|outbreak of MERS]] in 2015 due to a lack of test kits. Afterwards, the country approved rapid deployment of COVID-19 test kits, and now they are able to test more than 10,000 people a day. In neighboring Japan, only about 2,700 people in total have been tested for COVID-19 as of 3 March. Officials in [[Seoul]] operate \"drive-thru\" testing stations for quick testing.

South Korea's widespread testing leads mild or asymptomatic cases to be identified so the proportion of dying goes down. Moreover, the infected population in the South Korea has a unique profile. Most of the country's infections are linked to the [[Shincheonji Church of Jesus]] and most of its members are young women.

South Korea experienced serious difficulties during the [[2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak in South Korea|outbreak of MERS]] in 2015 due to a lack of test kits. Afterwards, the country approved rapid deployment of COVID-19 test kits, and now they are able to test more than 10,000 people a day. In neighboring Japan, only about 2,700 people in total have been tested for COVID-19 as of 3 March. Officials in [[Seoul]] operate \"drive-thru\" testing stations for quick testing.

South Korea's widespread testing leads mild or asymptomatic cases to be identified so the proportion of dying goes down. Moreover, the infected population in the South Korea has a unique profile. Most of the country's infections are linked to the [[Shincheonji Church of Jesus]] and most of its members are young women.

Like all other cephalopods, squid have a distinct head, [[Symmetry (biology)#Bilateral symmetry|bilateral symmetry]], and a [[mantle (mollusc)|mantle]]. They are mainly soft-bodied, like [[octopus|octopuses]], but have a small internal skeleton in the form of a rod-like [[gladius (cephalopod)|gladius]] or pen, made of [[chitin]].\n\nSquid diverged from other cephalopods during the [[Jurassic]] and occupy a similar role to [[teleost]] fish as open water [[predator]]s of similar size and behaviour. They play an important role in the open water food web. The two long tentacles are used to grab prey and the eight arms to hold and control it. The beak then cuts the food into suitable size chunks for swallowing. Squid are rapid swimmers, moving by [[Aquatic locomotion#Jet propulsion|jet propulsion]], and largely locate their prey by sight. They are among the most intelligent of [[invertebrates]], with groups of [[Humboldt squid]] having been observed [[Pack hunter|hunting cooperatively]]. They are preyed on by [[shark]]s, other fish, sea birds, [[Pinniped|seals]] and [[cetacea]]ns, particularly [[sperm whale]]s.\n\nSquid can change colour for [[camouflage]] and [[Signalling theory|signalling]]. Some species are [[bioluminescent]], using their light for [[counter-illumination]] camouflage, while many species can eject a cloud of [[cephalopod ink|ink]] to distract predators.\n\nSquid are used for human consumption with commercial fisheries in Japan, the Mediterranean, the southwestern Atlantic, the eastern Pacific and elsewhere. They are used in cuisines around the world, often known as \"[[Squid as food|calamari]]\". Squid have featured in literature since classical times, especially in tales of giant squid and [[sea monster]]s.\n\n==Taxonomy and phylogeny==\nSquid are members of the class [[Cephalopod]]a, subclass [[Coleoidea]]. The squid [[Order (taxonomy)|orders]] [[Myopsida]] and [[Oegopsida]] are in the superorder [[Decapodiformes]] (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] for \"ten-legged\"). Two other orders of decapodiform cephalopods are also called squid, although they are [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomically]] distinct from squids and differ recognizably in their gross anatomical features. They are the [[bobtail squid]] of order [[Sepiolida]] and the [[ram's horn squid]] of the monotypic order [[Spirulida]]. The [[vampire squid]] (''[[Vampyroteuthis]] infernalis''), however, is more closely related to the octopuses than to any squid.<ref name=\"Sanchez Setiamarga 2018\">{{cite journal |last1=Sanchez |first1=Gustavo |last2=Setiamarga |first2=Davin H.

The head and foot of the squid are at one end of a long body, and this end is functionally [[anterior]], leading the animal as it moves through the water. A set of eight arms and two distinctive tentacles surround the mouth; each appendage takes the form of a [[muscular hydrostat]] and is flexible and prehensile, usually bearing disc-like suckers.<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\nThe suckers may lie directly on the arm or be stalked. Their rims are stiffened with chitin and may contain minute toothlike denticles. These features, as well as strong musculature, and a small ganglion beneath each sucker to allow individual control, provide a very powerful adhesion to grip prey. Hooks are present on the arms and tentacles in some species, but their function is unclear.<ref name=Hanlon/> The two tentacles are much longer than the arms and are retractile. Suckers are limited to the spatulate tip of the tentacle, known as the [[Manus (anatomy)|manus]].<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\nIn the mature male, the outer half of one of the left arms is [[hectocotylus|hectocotylised]] \u2013 and ends in a copulatory pad rather than suckers. This is used for depositing a [[spermatophore]] inside the mantle cavity of a female. A ventral part of the foot has been converted into a [[siphon (mollusc)|funnel]] through which water exits the mantle cavity.<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\nThe main body mass is enclosed in the mantle, which has a [[Cephalopod fin|swimming fin]] along each side. These fins are not the main source of locomotion in most species. The mantle wall is heavily muscled and internal. The visceral mass, which is covered by a thin, membranous [[Squamous epithelium|epidermis]], forms a cone-shaped posterior region known as the \"visceral hump\". The mollusc shell is reduced to an internal, longitudinal chitinous \"pen\" in the functionally dorsal part of the animal; the pen acts to stiffen the squid and provides attachments for muscles.<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\nOn the functionally ventral part of the body is an opening to the mantle cavity, which contains the [[gill]]s (ctenidia) and openings from the excretory, digestive and [[reproductive system]]s. An inhalant siphon behind the funnel draws water into the mantel cavity via a valve. The squid uses the funnel for locomotion via precise jet propulsion.<ref name=Johnson1972>{{Cite journal | last1=Johnson | first1=W. | last2=Soden | first2=P. D. | last3=Trueman | first3=E.

From there, it escapes downwards, some of it travelling directly, some coming off a reflector at the top of the organ (dorsal side). Below there is a kind of [[iris (eye)|iris]], which has branches (diverticula) of its [[ink sac]], with a lens below that; both the reflector and lens are derived from [[mesoderm]]. The squid controls light production by changing the shape of its iris or adjusting the strength of yellow filters on its underside, which presumably change the balance of wavelengths emitted.<ref name=\"Jones 2004\"/> Light production shows a correlation with intensity of down-welling light, but it is about one third as bright; the squid can track repeated changes in brightness.

Squids have a complex brain in the form of a nerve ring encircling the [[oesophagus]], enclosed in a cartilaginous [[cranium]]. Paired cerebral [[ganglia]] above the oesophagus receive sensory information from the eyes and [[statocyst]]s, and further ganglia below control the muscles of the mouth, foot, mantle and viscera.

Their structure is very similar to that of a fish eye, with a globular [[Lens (anatomy)|lens]] that has a [[depth of focus]] from {{convert|3|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} to infinity. The image is focused by changing the position of the lens, as in a camera or [[telescope]], rather than changing the shape of the lens, as in the [[human eye]]. Squid adjust to changes in light intensity by expanding and contracting the slit-shaped [[pupil]].<ref name=Ruppert/> Deep sea squids in the family Histioteuthidae have eyes of two different types and orientation. The large left eye is tubular in shape and looks upwards, presumably searching for the silhouettes of animals higher in the [[water column]].

The male has a [[testis]] from which sperm pass into a single gonoduct where they are rolled together into a long bundle, or spermatophore. The gonoduct is elongated into a \"penis\" that extends into the mantle cavity and through which spermatophores are ejected. In shallow water species, the penis is short, and the spermatophore is removed from the mantle cavity by a tentacle of the male, which is specially adapted for the purpose and known as a [[hectocotylus]], and placed inside the mantle cavity of the female during mating.<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\n[[File:Uroteuthis duvauceli hectocotylus.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Hectocotylus]] of ''[[Uroteuthis duvauceli]]'': one tentacle of the male is adapted for transferring the [[spermatophore]]]]\n\nThe female has a large translucent [[ovary]], situated towards the posterior of the visceral mass.

The systemic heart consists of three chambers, a lower [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricle]] and two upper [[Atrium (heart)|atria]], all of which can contract to propel the blood.

This reservoir acts as a chemical buoyancy chamber, with the heavy metallic cations typical of seawater replaced by low [[Molecular mass|molecular-weight]] [[ammonium]] ions, a product of excretion. The small difference in density provides a small contribution to buoyancy per unit volume, so the mechanism requires a large buoyancy chamber to be effective. Since the chamber is filled with liquid, it has the advantage over a swim bladder of not changing significantly in volume with pressure. Glass squids in the family [[Cranchiidae]] for example, have an enormous transparent coelom containing ammonium ions and occupying about two-thirds the volume of the animal, allowing it to float at the required depth.

The embryo grows as a [[germinal disc|disc of cells]] on [[animal pole|top of the yolk]]. During the [[gastrulation]] stage, the margins of the disc grow to surround the yolk, forming a yolk sac, which eventually forms part of the animal's gut. The dorsal side of the disc grows upwards and forms the embryo, with a shell gland on its dorsal surface, gills, mantle and eyes. The arms and funnel develop as part of the foot on the ventral side of the disc. The arms later migrate upwards, coming to form a ring around the funnel and mouth. The yolk is gradually absorbed as the embryo grows. Some juvenile squid live higher in the water column than do adults.

Slow movement is achieved by a gentle undulation of the muscular lateral fins on either side of the trunk which drives the animal forward. A more common means of locomotion providing sustained movement is achieved using jetting, during which contraction of the muscular wall of the mantle cavity provides jet propulsion.<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\nSlow jetting is used for ordinary locomotion, and ventilation of the gills is achieved at the same time. The circular muscles in the mantle wall contract; this causes the inhalant valve to close, the exhalant valve to open and the mantle edge to lock tightly around the head. Water is forced out through the funnel which is pointed in the opposite direction to the required direction of travel. The inhalant phase is initiated by the relaxation of the circular muscles causes them to stretch, the connective tissue in the mantle wall recoils elastically, the mantle cavity expands causing the inhalant valve to open, the exhalant valve to close and water to flow into the cavity. This cycle of exhalation and inhalation is repeated to provide continuous locomotion.<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\nFast jetting is an escape response. In this form of locomotion, radial muscles in the mantle wall are involved as well as circular ones, making it possible to hyper-inflate the mantle cavity with a larger volume of water than during slow jetting. On contraction, water flows out with great force, the funnel always being pointed anteriorly, and travel is backwards. During this means of locomotion, some squid exit the water in a similar way to [[flying fish]], gliding through the air for up to {{convert|50|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}, and occasionally ending up on the decks of ships.<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\n===Feeding===\nSquid are [[carnivore]]s, and, with their strong arms and suckers, can overwhelm relatively large animals efficiently. Prey is identified by sight or by touch, grabbed by the tentacles which can be shot out with great rapidity, brought back to within reach of the arms, and held by the hooks and suckers on their surface.<ref name=Messenger/> In some species, the squid's saliva contains [[toxin]]s which act to subdue the prey. These are injected into its bloodstream when the prey is bitten, along with vasodilators and chemicals to stimulate the heart, and quickly circulate to all parts of its body.<ref name=Ruppert/> The deep sea squid ''[[Taningia danae]]'' has been filmed releasing blinding flashes of light from large photophores on its arms to illuminate and disorientate potential prey.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Kubodera, T. |author2=Koyama, Y. |author3=Mori, K. |year=2006 |title=Observations of wild hunting behaviour and bioluminescence of a large deep-sea, eight-armed squid, ''Taningia danae'' |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=274 |issue=1613 |pages=1029\u20131034 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2006.0236 |pmid=17301020 |pmc=2124471 |url=http://www.pubs.royalsoc.ac.uk/media/proceedings_b/papers/RSPB20060236.pdf |access-date=13 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216024900/http://www.pubs.royalsoc.ac.uk/media/proceedings_b/papers/RSPB20060236.pdf |archive-date=16 February 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ventouse calmar.jpg|thumb|The whip-like tentacles of ''[[Mastigoteuthis]]'' are covered with tiny suckers to catch small organisms like [[flypaper]]]]\n\nAlthough squid can catch large prey, the mouth is relatively small, and the food must be cut into pieces by the chitinous beak with its powerful muscles before being swallowed.

Like all other cephalopods, squid have a distinct head, [[Symmetry (biology)#Bilateral symmetry|bilateral symmetry]], and a [[mantle (mollusc)|mantle]]. They are mainly soft-bodied, like [[octopus|octopuses]], but have a small internal skeleton in the form of a rod-like [[gladius (cephalopod)|gladius]] or pen, made of [[chitin]].\n\nSquid diverged from other cephalopods during the [[Jurassic]] and occupy a similar role to [[teleost]] fish as open water [[predator]]s of similar size and behaviour. They play an important role in the open water food web. The two long tentacles are used to grab prey and the eight arms to hold and control it. The beak then cuts the food into suitable size chunks for swallowing. Squid are rapid swimmers, moving by [[Aquatic locomotion#Jet propulsion|jet propulsion]], and largely locate their prey by sight. They are among the most intelligent of [[invertebrates]], with groups of [[Humboldt squid]] having been observed [[Pack hunter|hunting cooperatively]]. They are preyed on by [[shark]]s, other fish, sea birds, [[Pinniped|seals]] and [[cetacea]]ns, particularly [[sperm whale]]s.\n\nSquid can change colour for [[camouflage]] and [[Signalling theory|signalling]]. Some species are [[bioluminescent]], using their light for [[counter-illumination]] camouflage, while many species can eject a cloud of [[cephalopod ink|ink]] to distract predators.\n\nSquid are used for human consumption with commercial fisheries in Japan, the Mediterranean, the southwestern Atlantic, the eastern Pacific and elsewhere. They are used in cuisines around the world, often known as \"[[Squid as food|calamari]]\". Squid have featured in literature since classical times, especially in tales of giant squid and [[sea monster]]s.\n\n==Taxonomy and phylogeny==\nSquid are members of the class [[Cephalopod]]a, subclass [[Coleoidea]]. The squid [[Order (taxonomy)|orders]] [[Myopsida]] and [[Oegopsida]] are in the superorder [[Decapodiformes]] (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] for \"ten-legged\"). Two other orders of decapodiform cephalopods are also called squid, although they are [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomically]] distinct from squids and differ recognizably in their gross anatomical features. They are the [[bobtail squid]] of order [[Sepiolida]] and the [[ram's horn squid]] of the monotypic order [[Spirulida]]. The [[vampire squid]] (''[[Vampyroteuthis]] infernalis''), however, is more closely related to the octopuses than to any squid.<ref name=\"Sanchez Setiamarga 2018\">{{cite journal |last1=Sanchez |first1=Gustavo |last2=Setiamarga |first2=Davin H.

The head and foot of the squid are at one end of a long body, and this end is functionally [[anterior]], leading the animal as it moves through the water. A set of eight arms and two distinctive tentacles surround the mouth; each appendage takes the form of a [[muscular hydrostat]] and is flexible and prehensile, usually bearing disc-like suckers.<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\nThe suckers may lie directly on the arm or be stalked. Their rims are stiffened with chitin and may contain minute toothlike denticles. These features, as well as strong musculature, and a small ganglion beneath each sucker to allow individual control, provide a very powerful adhesion to grip prey. Hooks are present on the arms and tentacles in some species, but their function is unclear.<ref name=Hanlon/> The two tentacles are much longer than the arms and are retractile. Suckers are limited to the spatulate tip of the tentacle, known as the [[Manus (anatomy)|manus]].<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\nIn the mature male, the outer half of one of the left arms is [[hectocotylus|hectocotylised]] \u2013 and ends in a copulatory pad rather than suckers. This is used for depositing a [[spermatophore]] inside the mantle cavity of a female. A ventral part of the foot has been converted into a [[siphon (mollusc)|funnel]] through which water exits the mantle cavity.<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\nThe main body mass is enclosed in the mantle, which has a [[Cephalopod fin|swimming fin]] along each side. These fins are not the main source of locomotion in most species. The mantle wall is heavily muscled and internal. The visceral mass, which is covered by a thin, membranous [[Squamous epithelium|epidermis]], forms a cone-shaped posterior region known as the \"visceral hump\". The mollusc shell is reduced to an internal, longitudinal chitinous \"pen\" in the functionally dorsal part of the animal; the pen acts to stiffen the squid and provides attachments for muscles.<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\nOn the functionally ventral part of the body is an opening to the mantle cavity, which contains the [[gill]]s (ctenidia) and openings from the excretory, digestive and [[reproductive system]]s. An inhalant siphon behind the funnel draws water into the mantel cavity via a valve. The squid uses the funnel for locomotion via precise jet propulsion.<ref name=Johnson1972>{{Cite journal | last1=Johnson | first1=W. | last2=Soden | first2=P. D. | last3=Trueman | first3=E.

Squids have a complex brain in the form of a nerve ring encircling the [[oesophagus]], enclosed in a cartilaginous [[cranium]]. Paired cerebral [[ganglia]] above the oesophagus receive sensory information from the eyes and [[statocyst]]s, and further ganglia below control the muscles of the mouth, foot, mantle and viscera. [[Squid giant axon|Giant axons]] up to {{cvt|1|mm|in}} in diameter convey nerve messages with great rapidity to the circular muscles of the mantle wall, allowing a synchronous, powerful contraction and maximum speed in the jet propulsion system.<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\nThe paired eyes, on either side of the head, are housed in capsules fused to the cranium. Their structure is very similar to that of a fish eye, with a globular [[Lens (anatomy)|lens]] that has a [[depth of focus]] from {{convert|3|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} to infinity. The image is focused by changing the position of the lens, as in a camera or [[telescope]], rather than changing the shape of the lens, as in the [[human eye]]. Squid adjust to changes in light intensity by expanding and contracting the slit-shaped [[pupil]].<ref name=Ruppert/> Deep sea squids in the family Histioteuthidae have eyes of two different types and orientation.

The male has a [[testis]] from which sperm pass into a single gonoduct where they are rolled together into a long bundle, or spermatophore. The gonoduct is elongated into a \"penis\" that extends into the mantle cavity and through which spermatophores are ejected. In shallow water species, the penis is short, and the spermatophore is removed from the mantle cavity by a tentacle of the male, which is specially adapted for the purpose and known as a [[hectocotylus]], and placed inside the mantle cavity of the female during mating.<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\n[[File:Uroteuthis duvauceli hectocotylus.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Hectocotylus]] of ''[[Uroteuthis duvauceli]]'': one tentacle of the male is adapted for transferring the [[spermatophore]]]]\n\nThe female has a large translucent [[ovary]], situated towards the posterior of the visceral mass.

The systemic heart consists of three chambers, a lower [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricle]] and two upper [[Atrium (heart)|atria]], all of which can contract to propel the blood.

This reservoir acts as a chemical buoyancy chamber, with the heavy metallic cations typical of seawater replaced by low [[Molecular mass|molecular-weight]] [[ammonium]] ions, a product of excretion. The small difference in density provides a small contribution to buoyancy per unit volume, so the mechanism requires a large buoyancy chamber to be effective. Since the chamber is filled with liquid, it has the advantage over a swim bladder of not changing significantly in volume with pressure. Glass squids in the family [[Cranchiidae]] for example, have an enormous transparent coelom containing ammonium ions and occupying about two-thirds the volume of the animal, allowing it to float at the required depth.

The embryo grows as a [[germinal disc|disc of cells]] on [[animal pole|top of the yolk]]. During the [[gastrulation]] stage, the margins of the disc grow to surround the yolk, forming a yolk sac, which eventually forms part of the animal's gut. The dorsal side of the disc grows upwards and forms the embryo, with a shell gland on its dorsal surface, gills, mantle and eyes. The arms and funnel develop as part of the foot on the ventral side of the disc. The arms later migrate upwards, coming to form a ring around the funnel and mouth. The yolk is gradually absorbed as the embryo grows. Some juvenile squid live higher in the water column than do adults.

The bacteria also interact with [[hemocyte]]s, macrophage-like blood cells that migrate between epithelial cells, but the mechanism and function of this process is not well understood.

Slow movement is achieved by a gentle undulation of the muscular lateral fins on either side of the trunk which drives the animal forward. A more common means of locomotion providing sustained movement is achieved using jetting, during which contraction of the muscular wall of the mantle cavity provides jet propulsion.<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\nSlow jetting is used for ordinary locomotion, and ventilation of the gills is achieved at the same time. The circular muscles in the mantle wall contract; this causes the inhalant valve to close, the exhalant valve to open and the mantle edge to lock tightly around the head. Water is forced out through the funnel which is pointed in the opposite direction to the required direction of travel. The inhalant phase is initiated by the relaxation of the circular muscles causes them to stretch, the connective tissue in the mantle wall recoils elastically, the mantle cavity expands causing the inhalant valve to open, the exhalant valve to close and water to flow into the cavity. This cycle of exhalation and inhalation is repeated to provide continuous locomotion.<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\nFast jetting is an escape response. In this form of locomotion, radial muscles in the mantle wall are involved as well as circular ones, making it possible to hyper-inflate the mantle cavity with a larger volume of water than during slow jetting.

The female attaches them to the substrate in strings or groups, the coating layers swelling and hardening after contact with sea water.

Another name, '''Ansari''' ({{lang-ar|\u0627\u0646\u0635\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0629}} ''An\u1e63\u0101r\u012byah''), is believed to be a mistransliteration of \"Nusayri\".\n\nAccording to [[Mehrdad Izady]], Alawites represent 17.2 percent of the [[Syrians|Syrian population]], an increase from 11.8 percent in 2010<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://gulf2000.columbia.edu/images/maps/Syria_Ethnic_Shift_2010-2018_lg.png|title=Syria: Ethnic Shift, 2010-mid 2018|last=Izady|first=Michael|website=gulf2000.columbia.edu}}</ref> and are a significant minority in the [[Hatay Province]] of [[Turkey]] and northern [[Lebanon]]. There is also a population living in the village of [[Ghajar]] in the [[Golan Heights]]. Alawites form the dominant religious group on the Syrian coast and towns near the coast which are also inhabited by [[Sunni]]s, [[Christianity in Syria|Christians]], and [[Ismailis]]. They are often confused with the [[Alevis]] of Turkey.\n\nAlawites identify as a separate ethnoreligious group. The [[Quran]] is only one of their holy books and texts, and their interpretation thereof has very little in common with the [[Shia]] Muslim interpretation but in accordance with the early [[Batiniyya]] and other Muslim ''[[ghulat]]'' sects. Alawite theology and rituals break from mainstream Shia Islam in several remarkable ways. For one, the Alawites drink [[wine]] as Ali's transubstantiated essence in their rituals;<ref name=\"urlJourney to the End of Islam - Michael Knight - Google Ksi\u0105\u017cki\">{{cite book|author=Michael Knight|title=Journey to the End of Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9XM4AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA128|date=10 December 2009|publisher=Soft Skull Press|isbn=978-1-59376-552-1|page=128}}</ref> while other Muslims [[Alcohol in Islam|abstain from alcohol]], Alawites are encouraged to drink socially in moderation.

Arabic accounts of their beliefs tend to be partisan (either positively or negatively).<ref name=YFNAIRHI2010:68>[[#YFNAIRHI2010|Friedman, ''Nu\u1e63ayr\u012b-\u02bfAlaw\u012bs'', 2010]]: p.68</ref> However, since the early 2000s, [[Western world|Western]] scholarship on the Alawite religion has made significant advances.<ref name=YFNAIRHI2010:67>[[#YFNAIRHI2010|Friedman, ''Nu\u1e63ayr\u012b-\u02bfAlaw\u012bs'', 2010]]: p.67</ref> At the core of Alawite belief is a divine triad, comprising three aspects of the one God. These aspects, or [[Emanationism|emanations]], appear cyclically in human form throughout history.\n\nThe establishment of the [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|French Mandate of Syria]] marked a turning point in Alawi history. It gave the French the power to recruit Syrian civilians into their armed forces for an indefinite period and created exclusive areas for minorities, including an [[Alawite State]]. The Alawite State was later dismantled, but the Alawites continued to be a significant part of the [[Syrian Armed Forces]]. Since [[Hafez al-Assad]] took power through the 1970 [[Corrective Movement (Syria)|Corrective Movement]], the government has been dominated by a political elite led by the Alawite [[Al-Assad family]]. During the [[Islamist uprising in Syria]] in the 1970s and 1980s, the establishment came under pressure. Even greater pressure has resulted from the [[Syrian Civil War]].\n\n== Etymology ==\nIn older sources, Alawis are often called \"Ansaris\". According to [[Samuel Lyde]], who lived among the Alawites during the mid-19th century, this was a term they used among themselves. Other sources indicate that \"Ansari\" is simply a Western error in the transliteration of \"Nusayri\".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DnDP09R4s_0C&pg=PA97&lpg=PA97|title=Initiates and The People Part 2, May 1929 to June 1930 |first= R.

The following quote from Alkan (2012) illustrates this point: <blockquote>\"In actual fact, the name 'Alaw\u012b' appears as early as in an 11th century Nu\u1e63ayr\u012b tract (\u2026). Moreover, the term  'Alaw\u012b' was already used at the beginning of the 20th century. In 1903 the Belgian-born Jesuit and Orientalist Henri Lammens (d. 1937) visited a certain \u1e24aydar\u012b-Nu\u1e63ayr\u012b sheikh Abdullah in a village near Antakya and mentions that the latter preferred the name 'Alaw\u012b' for his people. Lastly, it is interesting to note that in the above-mentioned petitions of 1892 and 1909 the Nu\u1e63ayr\u012bs called themselves the 'Arab Alaw\u012b people' (\u02bfArab \u02bfAlev\u012b \u1e6d\u0101\u02beifesi) 'our \u02bfAlaw\u012b Nu\u1e63ayr\u012b people' (\u1e6d\u0101\u02beifatun\u0101 al-Nu\u1e63ayriyya al-\u02bfAlawiyya) or 'signed with Alaw\u012b people' (\u02bfAlev\u012b \u1e6d\u0101\u02beifesi im\u017c\u0101s\u0131yla). This early self-designation is, in my opinion, of triple importance. Firstly, it shows that the word 'Alaw\u012b' was always used by these people, as \u02bfAlaw\u012b authors emphasize; secondly, it hints at the reformation of the Nu\u1e63ayr\u012bs, launched by some of their sheikhs in the 19th century and their attempt to be accepted as part of Islam; and thirdly, it challenges the claims that the change of the identity and name from 'Nu\u1e63ayr\u012b' to '\u02bfAlaw\u012b' took place around 1920, in the beginning of the French mandate in Syria (1919\u20131938).\"<ref>See, Alkan, N.

According to Friedman and other scholars, the Alawi movement started as many other mystical ghulat sects with an explicit concentration on an allegorical and esoteric meaning of the Quran and other mystical practices, and not as a pure syncretic sect, though later they embraced some other practices as they believed all religions had the same ''Batin'' core.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://goaloflife.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/the-nuc59fayrc4ab-_alawc4abs-_-an-introduction-to-the-religion-history-and-identity-of-the-leading-minority-in-syria-islamic-history-and-civilization.pdf|title=Friedman, ''The Nusayris-Alawis, An introduction to the religion, history and identity'': p.223\u2013238}}</ref>\n\nJournalist [[Robert F.

In the [[Demographics of Turkey#1965 census|1965 census]] (the last Turkish census where informants were asked their [[First language|mother tongue]]), 700,000 people in the three provinces declared their mother tongue as [[Arabic language|Arabic]]; however, Arabic-speaking Sunnis and Christians were also included in this figure. Turkish Alawites traditionally speak the same dialect of [[Levantine Arabic]] as Syrian Alawites. Arabic is preserved in rural communities and in Samanda\u011f. Younger people in the cities of \u00c7ukurova and [[\u0130skenderun]] tend to speak Turkish. The Turkish spoken by Alawites is distinguished by its [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accents]] and [[vocabulary]]. Knowledge of the [[Arabic alphabet]] is confined to religious leaders and men who have worked or studied in [[Arab world|Arab countries]].\n\nAlawites demonstrate considerable [[social mobility]]. Until the 1960s, they were bound to Sunni ''aghas'' (landholders) around Antakya and were poor. Alawites are prominent in the sectors of transportation and commerce and a large, professional middle class has emerged. Male [[exogamy]] has increased, particularly by those who attend universities or live in other parts of Turkey. These marriages are tolerated; however, female exogamy (as in other [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]] groups) is discouraged.\n\nAlawites, like Alevis, have strong [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] political beliefs. However, some people in rural areas (usually members of notable Alawite families) may support secular, conservative parties such as the [[Democratic Party (Turkey, current)|Democratic Party]]. Most Alawites feel oppressed by the policies of the [[Presidency of Religious Affairs]] in Turkey (''Diyanet \u0130\u015fleri Ba\u015fkanl\u0131\u011f\u0131'').<ref>''Fellahlar'\u0131n Sosyolojisi'', Dr. Cahit Aslan, Adana, 2005</ref><ref>''Arap Alevili\u011fi: Nusayrilik'', \u00d6mer Ulu\u00e7ay, Adana, 1999</ref>\n\n=== Lebanon ===\n\nThere are an estimated 40,000<ref name=\"repost1\" /><ref>{{cite web|author=Zoi Constantine |url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/worldwide/pressures-in-syria-affect-alawites-in-lebanon |title=Pressures in Syria affect Alawites in Lebanon \u2013 The National |work=The National|location=Abu Dhabi |accessdate=6 July 2012}}</ref> Alawites in Lebanon, where they have lived since at least the 16th century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2005/Apr-30/4206-lebanese-allawites-welcome-syrias-withdrawal-as-necessary.ashx#axzz2njhPbwW1|title=Lebanese Allawites welcome Syria's withdrawal as 'necessary'|date=30 April 2005|newspaper=The Daily Star}}</ref> They are one of the 18 official Lebanese sects; due to the efforts of their leader, [[Ali Eid]], the [[Taif Agreement]] of 1989 gave them two reserved seats in Parliament.

Alawites form the dominant religious group on the Syrian coast and towns near the coast which are also inhabited by [[Sunni]]s, [[Christianity in Syria|Christians]], and [[Ismailis]]. They are often confused with the [[Alevis]] of Turkey.\n\nAlawites identify as a separate ethnoreligious group. The [[Quran]] is only one of their holy books and texts, and their interpretation thereof has very little in common with the [[Shia]] Muslim interpretation but in accordance with the early [[Batiniyya]] and other Muslim ''[[ghulat]]'' sects.

Arabic accounts of their beliefs tend to be partisan (either positively or negatively).<ref name=YFNAIRHI2010:68>[[#YFNAIRHI2010|Friedman, ''Nu\u1e63ayr\u012b-\u02bfAlaw\u012bs'', 2010]]: p.68</ref> However, since the early 2000s, [[Western world|Western]] scholarship on the Alawite religion has made significant advances.<ref name=YFNAIRHI2010:67>[[#YFNAIRHI2010|Friedman, ''Nu\u1e63ayr\u012b-\u02bfAlaw\u012bs'', 2010]]: p.67</ref> At the core of Alawite belief is a divine triad, comprising three aspects of the one God. These aspects, or [[Emanationism|emanations]], appear cyclically in human form throughout history.\n\nThe establishment of the [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|French Mandate of Syria]] marked a turning point in Alawi history. It gave the French the power to recruit Syrian civilians into their armed forces for an indefinite period and created exclusive areas for minorities, including an [[Alawite State]]. The Alawite State was later dismantled, but the Alawites continued to be a significant part of the [[Syrian Armed Forces]]. Since [[Hafez al-Assad]] took power through the 1970 [[Corrective Movement (Syria)|Corrective Movement]], the government has been dominated by a political elite led by the Alawite [[Al-Assad family]]. During the [[Islamist uprising in Syria]] in the 1970s and 1980s, the establishment came under pressure. Even greater pressure has resulted from the [[Syrian Civil War]].\n\n== Etymology ==\nIn older sources, Alawis are often called \"Ansaris\". According to [[Samuel Lyde]], who lived among the Alawites during the mid-19th century, this was a term they used among themselves. Other sources indicate that \"Ansari\" is simply a Western error in the transliteration of \"Nusayri\".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DnDP09R4s_0C&pg=PA97&lpg=PA97|title=Initiates and The People Part 2, May 1929 to June 1930 |first= R.

The following quote from Alkan (2012) illustrates this point: <blockquote>\"In actual fact, the name 'Alaw\u012b' appears as early as in an 11th century Nu\u1e63ayr\u012b tract (\u2026). Moreover, the term  'Alaw\u012b' was already used at the beginning of the 20th century. In 1903 the Belgian-born Jesuit and Orientalist Henri Lammens (d. 1937) visited a certain \u1e24aydar\u012b-Nu\u1e63ayr\u012b sheikh Abdullah in a village near Antakya and mentions that the latter preferred the name 'Alaw\u012b' for his people. Lastly, it is interesting to note that in the above-mentioned petitions of 1892 and 1909 the Nu\u1e63ayr\u012bs called themselves the 'Arab Alaw\u012b people' (\u02bfArab \u02bfAlev\u012b \u1e6d\u0101\u02beifesi) 'our \u02bfAlaw\u012b Nu\u1e63ayr\u012b people' (\u1e6d\u0101\u02beifatun\u0101 al-Nu\u1e63ayriyya al-\u02bfAlawiyya) or 'signed with Alaw\u012b people' (\u02bfAlev\u012b \u1e6d\u0101\u02beifesi im\u017c\u0101s\u0131yla). This early self-designation is, in my opinion, of triple importance. Firstly, it shows that the word 'Alaw\u012b' was always used by these people, as \u02bfAlaw\u012b authors emphasize; secondly, it hints at the reformation of the Nu\u1e63ayr\u012bs, launched by some of their sheikhs in the 19th century and their attempt to be accepted as part of Islam; and thirdly, it challenges the claims that the change of the identity and name from 'Nu\u1e63ayr\u012b' to '\u02bfAlaw\u012b' took place around 1920, in the beginning of the French mandate in Syria (1919\u20131938).\"<ref>See, Alkan, N.

In 1949, after the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]], Syria experienced a number of military coups and the rise of the Ba'ath Party.\n\nIn 1958, Syria and Egypt were united by a political agreement into the [[United Arab Republic]]. The UAR lasted for three years, breaking apart in 1961 when a group of army officers seized power and declared Syria independent.\n\nA succession of coups ensued until, in 1963, a secretive military committee (including Alawite officers [[Hafez al-Assad]] and [[Salah Jadid]]) helped the Ba'ath Party seize power. In 1966 Alawite-affiliated military officers successfully rebelled and expelled the Ba\u2019ath Party old guard followers of [[Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch|Greek Orthodox]] Christian [[Michel Aflaq]] and Sunni Muslim [[Salah ad-Din al-Bitar]], calling [[Zaki al-Arsuzi]] the \"[[Socrates]]\" of the reconstituted Ba'ath Party.\n\nIn 1970 [[Syrian Air Force|Air Force]] General Hafez al-Assad, an Alawite, took power and instigated a [[Corrective Movement (Syria)|\"Corrective Movement\"]] in the Ba'ath Party.

According to Friedman and other scholars, the Alawi movement started as many other mystical ghulat sects with an explicit concentration on an allegorical and esoteric meaning of the Quran and other mystical practices, and not as a pure syncretic sect, though later they embraced some other practices as they believed all religions had the same ''Batin'' core.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://goaloflife.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/the-nuc59fayrc4ab-_alawc4abs-_-an-introduction-to-the-religion-history-and-identity-of-the-leading-minority-in-syria-islamic-history-and-civilization.pdf|title=Friedman, ''The Nusayris-Alawis, An introduction to the religion, history and identity'': p.223\u2013238}}</ref>\n\nJournalist [[Robert F. Worth]] argues that the idea that the Alawi religion as a branch of Islam is a rewriting of history made necessary by the French colonialists abandonment of the Alawi and departure from Syria. Worth describes the \"first ... authentic source for outsiders about the religion\" (written by Soleyman of Adana \u2013 a 19th-century Alawi convert to Christianity who broke his oath of secrecy on the religion) explaining that the Alawi (according to Soleyman) deified Ali, venerated Christ, Muhammad, [[Plato]], [[Socrates]], and [[Aristotle]], and held themselves apart from Muslims and Christians, whom they considered heretics.<ref name=RFWRfO2016:82>[[#RFWRfO2016|Worth, ''A Rage for Order'', 2016]]: p.82</ref>\n\nIn 1936, six Alawi notables fearing persecution of their religion, petitioned the French colonialists not to merge their Alawi enclave with the rest of Syria, insisting that \"the spirit of hatred and fanaticism embedded in the hearts of the Arab Muslims against everything that is non-Muslim has been perpetually nurtured by the Islamic religion\".<ref name=RFWRfO2016:85>[[#RFWRfO2016|Worth, ''A Rage for Order'', 2016]]: p.85</ref> According to Worth, later fatwas declaring Alawi to be part of the Shia community were by Shia clerics \"eager for Syrian Patronage\" from Syria's Alawi president [[Hafez al-Assad]] who was eager for Islamic legitimacy in the face of the hostility of Syria's Muslim majority.<ref name=RFWRfO2016:85 />\n\nYaron Friedman does not suggest that Alawi did not consider themselves Muslims but does state that,<blockquote>The modern period has witnessed tremendous changes in the definition of the \u02bfAlaw\u012bs and the attitude towards them in the Muslim world. ... In order to end their long isolation, the name of the sect was changed in the 1920s from Nus\u1ea1yriyya to \u02bfAlawiyya'.

The term ''Nusayr\u012b'', previously used in theological texts, has been revived in recent studies. In [[\u00c7ukurova]], Alawites are known as ''[[Fellah]]'' and ''Arabu\u015fa\u011f\u0131'' (although the latter is considered offensive) by the Sunni population. A quasi-official name used during the 1930s by Turkish authorities was ''Eti T\u00fcrkleri'' (\"Hittite Turks\"), to conceal their [[Arabs in Turkey|Arabic]] origins. Although this term is obsolete, it is still used by some older people as a [[euphemism]].\n\nThe exact number of Alawites in Turkey is unknown; there were 700,000 in 1970,<ref>{{Cite book | title=State and rural society in medieval Islam: sultans, muqta\u02bbs, and fallahun | year=1997 | publisher=E.J.

In the [[Demographics of Turkey#1965 census|1965 census]] (the last Turkish census where informants were asked their [[First language|mother tongue]]), 700,000 people in the three provinces declared their mother tongue as [[Arabic language|Arabic]]; however, Arabic-speaking Sunnis and Christians were also included in this figure. Turkish Alawites traditionally speak the same dialect of [[Levantine Arabic]] as Syrian Alawites. Arabic is preserved in rural communities and in Samanda\u011f. Younger people in the cities of \u00c7ukurova and [[\u0130skenderun]] tend to speak Turkish. The Turkish spoken by Alawites is distinguished by its [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accents]] and [[vocabulary]]. Knowledge of the [[Arabic alphabet]] is confined to religious leaders and men who have worked or studied in [[Arab world|Arab countries]].\n\nAlawites demonstrate considerable [[social mobility]]. Until the 1960s, they were bound to Sunni ''aghas'' (landholders) around Antakya and were poor. Alawites are prominent in the sectors of transportation and commerce and a large, professional middle class has emerged. Male [[exogamy]] has increased, particularly by those who attend universities or live in other parts of Turkey. These marriages are tolerated; however, female exogamy (as in other [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]] groups) is discouraged.\n\nAlawites, like Alevis, have strong [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] political beliefs. However, some people in rural areas (usually members of notable Alawite families) may support secular, conservative parties such as the [[Democratic Party (Turkey, current)|Democratic Party]]. Most Alawites feel oppressed by the policies of the [[Presidency of Religious Affairs]] in Turkey (''Diyanet \u0130\u015fleri Ba\u015fkanl\u0131\u011f\u0131'').<ref>''Fellahlar'\u0131n Sosyolojisi'', Dr. Cahit Aslan, Adana, 2005</ref><ref>''Arap Alevili\u011fi: Nusayrilik'', \u00d6mer Ulu\u00e7ay, Adana, 1999</ref>\n\n=== Lebanon ===\n\nThere are an estimated 40,000<ref name=\"repost1\" /><ref>{{cite web|author=Zoi Constantine |url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/worldwide/pressures-in-syria-affect-alawites-in-lebanon |title=Pressures in Syria affect Alawites in Lebanon \u2013 The National |work=The National|location=Abu Dhabi |accessdate=6 July 2012}}</ref> Alawites in Lebanon, where they have lived since at least the 16th century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2005/Apr-30/4206-lebanese-allawites-welcome-syrias-withdrawal-as-necessary.ashx#axzz2njhPbwW1|title=Lebanese Allawites welcome Syria's withdrawal as 'necessary'|date=30 April 2005|newspaper=The Daily Star}}</ref> They are one of the 18 official Lebanese sects; due to the efforts of their leader, [[Ali Eid]], the [[Taif Agreement]] of 1989 gave them two reserved seats in Parliament.

Filmed in 1967, it did not receive a release until 1970 following the success of ''[[Easy Rider]]'' . It is one of several motorcycle gang films of the period to feature Nicholson, Dern and Stanton. The film was co-written, produced and directed by Martin B. Cohen in his only directorial effort.\n\n==Plot==\nPaul Collier searches for Karen, his girl friend who is going to have his child but ran away from him instead of marrying him. As the two attempt to reconcile a small motorcycle gang called the Rebel Rousers comes into the town. Their leader, J.J. Weston went to school and played football with Paul, but rather than catch up with each other, Paul goes to search for Karen and J.J. goes with his gang. The gang's exuberant behaviour in a local [[diner]] causes the sheriff to run them out of town.\n\nOutside of the town, Paul and Karen are captured by the gang with Paul beaten up and the gang vying for who will be the first to have their way with Karen. Though J.J. tries to help the couple the gang pull a pistol on him. J.J. seeks to delay Karen's fate by holding a motorcycle drag race to determine who will \"win\" Paul's pregnant girlfriend.\n\nPaul makes his way to the town where the sheriff is away taking a prisoner to another town to serve his sentence. No one in town will help Paul free his girlfriend until he comes across a group of Mexicans who confront the Rebel Rousers.\n\n==Production==\nMartin B. Cohen was the manager of Bruce Dern and his then wife Diane Ladd, formed his own film company Paragon International Pictures. Following the success of ''[[The Wild Angels]]'', Cohen cast Dern and Ladd who was pregnant with [[Laura Dern]] in the motorcycle gang film.

Filmed in 1967, it did not receive a release until 1970 following the success of ''[[Easy Rider]]'' . It is one of several motorcycle gang films of the period to feature Nicholson, Dern and Stanton. The film was co-written, produced and directed by Martin B. Cohen in his only directorial effort.\n\n==Plot==\nPaul Collier searches for Karen, his girl friend who is going to have his child but ran away from him instead of marrying him. As the two attempt to reconcile a small motorcycle gang called the Rebel Rousers comes into the town. Their leader, J.J. Weston went to school and played football with Paul, but rather than catch up with each other, Paul goes to search for Karen and J.J. goes with his gang. The gang's exuberant behaviour in a local [[diner]] causes the sheriff to run them out of town.\n\nOutside of the town, Paul and Karen are captured by the gang with Paul beaten up and the gang vying for who will be the first to have their way with Karen. Though J.J. tries to help the couple the gang pull a pistol on him. J.J. seeks to delay Karen's fate by holding a motorcycle drag race to determine who will \"win\" Paul's pregnant girlfriend.\n\nPaul makes his way to the town where the sheriff is away taking a prisoner to another town to serve his sentence. No one in town will help Paul free his girlfriend until he comes across a group of Mexicans who confront the Rebel Rousers.\n\n==Production==\nMartin B. Cohen was the manager of Bruce Dern and his then wife Diane Ladd, formed his own film company Paragon International Pictures. Following the success of ''[[The Wild Angels]]'', Cohen cast Dern and Ladd who was pregnant with [[Laura Dern]] in the motorcycle gang film. Bruce Dern brought his friend Jack Nicholson in the film along with Nicholson's former roommate Harry Dean Stanton and their friend Neil Nephew.

If not pruned regularly, the bush will become very 'leggy', growing upwards until the weight of the stems is greater than their strength, at which point the stems will sag down to the ground and possibly break. Other species only flower on 'old wood'. Thus new wood resulting from pruning will not produce flowers until the following season.\n\nHydrangea root and rhizome are indicated for treatment of conditions of the urinary tract in the PDR for Herbal Medicine and may have diuretic properties.<ref>PDR for Herbal Medicine 3rd Edition Page 453</ref> Hydrangeas are moderately toxic if eaten, with all parts of the plant containing [[cyanogenic glycoside]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aspca.org/pet-care/poison-control/plants/hills-of-snow.html|title=Hills of Snow|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2018}}</ref>  ''[[Hydrangea paniculata]]'' is reportedly sometimes smoked as an intoxicant, despite the danger of illness and/or death due to the [[cyanide]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.erowid.org/herbs/hydrangea/hydrangea.shtml|title=Erowid Hydrangea Vault|website=www.erowid.org|accessdate=31 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/06/high-danger-hydrangea-french-police-hunt-gang|title=High danger hydrangea?

For the fullest taste, fresh leaves are crumpled, steamed, and dried, yielding dark brown tea leaves. Ama-cha is mainly used for ''kan-butsu-e'' (the [[Buddha]] bathing ceremony) on April 8 every year\u2014the day thought to be Buddha's birthday in Japan. During the ceremony, Ama-cha is poured over a statue of Buddha and served to people in attendance. A legend has it that on the day Buddha was born, nine [[dragon]]s poured [[Amrita]] over him; ama-cha is substituted for Amrita in Japan.\n\nIn [[Korean tea]], ''[[Hydrangea serrata]]'' ([[hangul]]:\uc0b0\uc218\uad6d [[hanja]]:{{linktext|\u5c71|\u6c34|\u83ca}}) is used for an [[herbal tea]] called ''sugukcha'' (\uc218\uad6d\ucc28) or ''ilsulcha'' (\uc774\uc2ac\ucc28).\n\nThe pink hydrangea has risen in popularity all over the world, but especially in Asia. Pink hydrangeas have many different meanings, but generally mean, \"You are the beat of my heart,\" as described by the celebrated Asian florist [[Tan Jun Yong]], where he was quoted saying, \"The light delicate blush of the petals reminds me of a beating heart, while the size could only match the heart of the sender!\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollmagazine.com/archive/oct11/articles/garden.php|title=Hydrangeas, Hydrangeas, Hydrangeas - Roll Gardening & Green :: Roll Magazine: Creative Living in the Hudson Valley|website=www.rollmagazine.com|accessdate=31 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nHydrangea quercifolia was declared the official state wildflower of [[Alabama]] in 1999.<ref>State Botanical SymbolsBy Alan McPherson, p.3</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Hortensiapink.JPG|''[[Hydrangea macrophylla]]''\nFile:Hydrangea close up.jpg|Hydrangea flowers close up.\nFile:Pink Hydrangea Flowers.jpg|Flowers\nFile:Hydrangea-heads-pale.png|''Hydrangea macrophylla'', flowers.\nFile:Blue Hydrangea.jpg|''Hydrangea macrophylla'', flowers\nFile:Hydrangea redoute.JPG|''Hydrangea sp'' painted by the botanical artist [[Redout\u00e9]].\nFile:Hydrangea quericifolia2.jpg|''Hydrangea quercifolia''\nFile:Hydrangea leaves.jpg|''Hydrangea macrophylla'', leaves\nFile:Wild hydrangea var annabelle.jpg|Wild Hydrangea v.
