The series is produced by [[Warner Bros. Television]], in association with [[Berlanti Productions]] and Archie Comics. Aguirre-Sacasa and [[Greg Berlanti]] serve as executive producers, alongside [[Sarah Schechter]], Jon Goldwater, and [[Lee Toland Krieger]].\n\nThe series is centered on the [[Archie Comics]] character [[Sabrina Spellman]], portrayed by [[Kiernan Shipka]], and also stars [[Ross Lynch]], [[Lucy Davis]], [[Chance Perdomo]], [[Michelle Gomez]], [[Jaz Sinclair]], [[Tati Gabrielle]], Adeline Rudolph, [[Richard Coyle]], and [[Miranda Otto]]. Originally in development during September 2017 at [[The CW]], the series was intended to be a companion series to ''[[Riverdale (2017 TV series)|Riverdale]]''; however, in December 2017, the project was moved to Netflix with a straight-to-series order, consisting of twenty episodes. Filming took place in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]].\n\nThe first half of the first season, consisting of ten episodes, was released on October 26, 2018.

A reboot of the [[Doctor Dolittle (1967 film)|original ''Doctor Dolittle'' film]] and its [[Dr. Dolittle (1998 film)|modern comedy counterparts]], the film is based on the [[Doctor Dolittle|titular character]] created by [[Hugh Lofting]], and primarily inspired by ''[[The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle]]'', the author's second Doctor Dolittle book. [[Robert Downey Jr.]] stars as the title character, alongside [[Antonio Banderas]] and [[Michael Sheen]] in live action roles, and a voice cast including [[Emma Thompson]], [[Rami Malek]], [[John Cena]], [[Kumail Nanjiani]], [[Octavia Spencer]], [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]], [[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]], [[Ralph Fiennes]], [[Selena Gomez]], and [[Marion Cotillard]]. \n\nThe project was announced in March 2017 with Downey set to star, and the rest of the cast joined over the following year. Filming began in March 2018 and lasted through June, taking place around the United Kingdom. The film underwent three weeks of reshoots in the spring of 2019, under the supervision of [[Jonathan Liebesman]] and [[Chris McKay]], after initial test screenings yielded poor results.\n\n''Dolittle'' was theatrically released in the United States on January 17, 2020, by [[Universal Pictures]]. It received generally negative reviews from critics for its screenplay, plot and humor. Having grossed $223 million worldwide against its $175 million budget, it is the [[2020 in film|third highest-grossing film of 2020]], although it was a [[box office bomb]], with projected losses for the studio as high as $100 million.\n\n==Plot==\nIn early [[Victorian era]] [[England]], Dr. John Dolittle ([[Robert Downey Jr.]]) is a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] [[veterinarian]] who has the ability to communicate with animals. After his wife, Lily ([[Kasia Smutniak]]) dies at sea, Dolittle becomes a recluse, tending to only animals and refusing to contact or assist with other humans. One day, a boy named Tommy Stubbins ([[Harry Collett]]) accidentally shoots and wounds a [[squirrel]] named Kevin ([[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]]) and is guided to Dolittle for help by a [[blue and gold macaw]] named Polynesia, (Poly for short) ([[Emma Thompson]]). \n\nMeanwhile, [[Queen Victoria]] ([[Jessie Buckley]]) sends a girl named Lady Rose ([[Carmel Laniado]]) with a message, ordering Dolittle to come in order to try to cure the queen of a deadly sickness. After being persuaded by Poly that he has to start trying to reconnect with fellow humans, Dolittle finally decides to go. Upon reaching her, he finds that the Queen has been poisoned by a type of [[Solanaceae|nightshade]] that was added to her [[tea]]. To be cured, she must eat a fruit from a far away land.\n\nAfter Poly, Betsy the [[giraffe]] ([[Selena Gomez]]) and Tutu the [[fox]] ([[Marion Cotillard]]) help Tommy escape from his home, he, Dolittle, and Dolittle's crew of animals, consisting of Poly, Kevin, [[Capuchin|capuchin]]s Elliot and Elsie, Chee-Chee the [[gorilla]] ([[Rami Malek]]), Yoshi the [[polar bear]] ([[John Cena]]), Plimpton the [[ostrich]] ([[Kumail Nanjiani]]), Dab-Dab the [[duck]] ([[Octavia Spencer]]) and Mini the [[sugar glider]] (Nick A. Fisher) put to sail, hoping to find the cure while trying to escape Dolittle's lifelong rival Dr. Blair M\u00fcdfly ([[Michael Sheen]]). Dolittle leaves his [[lurcher]] Jip ([[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]]) and a [[Phasmatodea|walking stick]] behind to guard the Queen while he's traveling. Along the way, Dolittle's boat is attacked by M\u00fcdfly, but they manage to escape by attaching a harness to a [[humpback whale]] that pulls the boat to safety.\n\nThey continue to the island where Lily was born. While attempting to steal Lily's journal which details the way to the fruit tree, Dolittle is captured by his former father-in-law King Rassouli ([[Antonio Banderas]]) and is locked in a cage with Barry ([[Ralph Fiennes]]), a moody [[tiger]] looking for his mother's approval. Just when it seems Dolittle is to be killed, Chee-Chee arrives and incapacitates Barry. Dolittle and Tommy escape only to be captured by M\u00fcdfly and have their ship destroyed. After seeing a crestfallen Dolittle, Rassouli loans him a boat to honour his daughter.\n\nTrailing M\u00fcdfly, Dolittle and company arrive at the cure tree's island, where they meet Ginko-Who-Soars ([[Frances de la Tour]]), a [[dragon]] who guards the tree since her husband's death. Ginko begins attacking (even accidentally make M\u00fcdfly fall into a hole) before she collapses due to internal pain.

A reboot of the [[Doctor Dolittle (1967 film)|original ''Doctor Dolittle'' film]] and its [[Dr. Dolittle (1998 film)|modern comedy counterparts]], the film is based on the [[Doctor Dolittle|titular character]] created by [[Hugh Lofting]], and primarily inspired by ''[[The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle]]'', the author's second Doctor Dolittle book. [[Robert Downey Jr.]] stars as the title character, alongside [[Antonio Banderas]] and [[Michael Sheen]] in live action roles, and a voice cast including [[Emma Thompson]], [[Rami Malek]], [[John Cena]], [[Kumail Nanjiani]], [[Octavia Spencer]], [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]], [[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]], [[Ralph Fiennes]], [[Selena Gomez]], and [[Marion Cotillard]]. \n\nThe project was announced in March 2017 with Downey set to star, and the rest of the cast joined over the following year. Filming began in March 2018 and lasted through June, taking place around the United Kingdom. The film underwent three weeks of reshoots in the spring of 2019, under the supervision of [[Jonathan Liebesman]] and [[Chris McKay]], after initial test screenings yielded poor results.\n\n''Dolittle'' was theatrically released in the United States on January 17, 2020, by [[Universal Pictures]]. It received generally negative reviews from critics for its screenplay, plot and humor. Having grossed $223 million worldwide against its $175 million budget, it is the [[2020 in film|third highest-grossing film of 2020]], although it was a [[box office bomb]], with projected losses for the studio as high as $100 million.\n\n==Plot==\nIn early Victorian era England, Dr. John Dolittle ([[Robert Downey Jr.]]) is a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] [[veterinarian]] who has the ability to communicate with animals. After his wife, Lily ([[Kasia Smutniak]]) dies at sea, Dolittle becomes a recluse, tending to only animals and refusing to contact or assist with other humans. One day, a boy named Tommy Stubbins ([[Harry Collett]]) accidentally shoots and wounds a squirrel named Kevin ([[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]]) and is guided to Dolittle for help by a macaw named Polynesia, (Poly for short) ([[Emma Thompson]]). \n\nMeanwhile, [[Queen Victoria]] ([[Jessie Buckley]]) sends a girl named Lady Rose ([[Carmel Laniado]]) with a message, ordering Dolittle to come in order to try to cure the queen of a deadly sickness. After being persuaded by Poly that he has to start trying to reconnect with fellow humans, Dolittle finally decides to go. Upon reaching her, he finds that the Queen has been poisoned by a type of [[Solanaceae|nightshade]] that was added to her tea. To be cured, she must eat a fruit from a far away land.\n\nAfter Poly, Betsy the giraffe ([[Selena Gomez]]) and Tutu the fox ([[Marion Cotillard]]) help Tommy escape from his home, he, Dolittle, and Dolittle's crew of animals, consisting of Poly, Kevin, monkeys Elliot and Elsie, Chee-Chee the gorilla ([[Rami Malek]]), Yoshi the polar bear ([[John Cena]]), Plimpton the ostrich ([[Kumail Nanjiani]]), Dab-Dab the duck ([[Octavia Spencer]]) and Mini the [[sugar glider]] (Nick A. Fisher) put to sail, hoping to find the cure while trying to escape Dolittle's lifelong rival Dr. Blair M\u00fcdfly ([[Michael Sheen]]). Dolittle leaves his [[lurcher]] Jip ([[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]]) and a [[Phasmatodea|walking stick]] behind to guard the Queen while he's traveling. Along the way, Dolittle's boat is attacked by M\u00fcdfly, but they manage to escape by attaching a harness to a whale that pulls the boat to safety.\n\nThey continue to the island where Lily was born. While attempting to steal Lily's journal which details the way to the fruit tree, Dolittle is captured by his former father-in-law King Rassouli ([[Antonio Banderas]]) and is locked in a cage with Barry ([[Ralph Fiennes]]), a moody tiger looking for his mother's approval. Just when it seems Dolittle is to be killed, a now-couragous Chee-Chee arrives and incapacitates Barry. Dolittle and Tommy escape only to be captured by M\u00fcdfly and have their ship destroyed. After seeing a crestfallen Dolittle, Rassouli loans him a boat to honour his daughter.\n\nTrailing M\u00fcdfly, Dolittle and company arrive at the cure tree's island, where they meet Ginko-Who-Soars ([[Frances de la Tour]]), a dragon who guards the tree since her husband's death.

It was written by [[Chris Chibnall]], and directed by [[Jamie Magnus Stone]]. It is the second of a two-part story; the previous episode, \"[[Ascension of the Cybermen]]\", aired on 23 February.\n\nThe episode stars [[Jodie Whittaker]] as the [[Thirteenth Doctor]], alongside [[Bradley Walsh]], [[Tosin Cole]], and [[Mandip Gill]] as her [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companion]]s, Graham O'Brien, Ryan Sinclair and Yasmin Khan, respectively. The episode also stars [[Sacha Dhawan]] as [[The Master (Doctor Who)|The Master]].\n\nThe episode was watched by 4.69 million viewers, and received mixed reviews from critics. The concept of the Timeless Child and how it impacts the Doctor's origins has been very divisive among fans.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe Master persuades the Doctor to join him on [[Gallifrey]], where he forces her to enter [[the Matrix (Doctor Who)|the Matrix]]. He shows her the secret history of Gallifrey and its native Shobogans. Tecteun, a space explorer, found a \"timeless child\" with infinite capacity to [[regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerate]]. She adopted the child and studied her, successfully grafting her regeneration capacity into the Shobogans, transforming them into Time Lords; they chose to limit a Time Lord's regenerations to twelve. The Master reveals that the Doctor is the \"timeless child\". Tecteun and the child were inducted into a clandestine organisation called the Division, the details of which were redacted from the Matrix. The Doctor's memories were subsequently erased, prior to the childhood she remembers; only snippets remain, masked as the story of the Irish policeman Brendan. \n\nWith the Doctor trapped in the Matrix, the Master lures Ashad to Gallifrey and shrinks him with his tissue compression eliminator, taking the Cyberium. With its knowledge and the bodies of the Time Lords he had killed on his arrival to Gallifrey, the Master creates a race of infinitely-regenerating Cybermen, aiming to use them to take over the universe. In the Matrix, a vision of the previously unseen Doctor from  \"Fugitive Of The Judoon\" restores the Doctor\u2019s belief in herself. The Doctor escapes by overloading the Matrix with all of her memories from her past incarnations.\n\nOn board the Cyber-carrier, Bescot is killed, while Yaz and Graham successfully hide from the invading Cybermen in empty Cyber-armor. They subsequently save the lives of Ryan, Ethan, and Ko Sharmus from Cybermen forces sent to the planet by Ashad. The group gather and agree to go through the portal to Gallifrey.\n\nThe Doctor regroups with her companions, and discovers Ashad's minaturised body contains a \"Death Particle\" capable of destroying all organic life on a planet. The Doctor and her friends blow up the Cyber-carrier, destroying Ashad's army in the process and foiling his plot to rebuild the Cyber-Empire. Finding unused TARDISes, she programs one to take her allies home. The Doctor takes one of Ko Sharmus' explosives to set off the particle. She is unable to trigger it when goaded by the Master, but Ko Sharmus appears and takes it, as penance for failing to suitably hide the Cyberium. The Doctor escapes in another TARDIS as the explosion consumes Gallifrey.\n\nThe Doctor's allies arrive on contemporary Earth in their TARDIS. The Doctor lands the other TARDIS near her own, but as she prepares to take off, she is arrested by the [[Judoon]] and teleported to a prison located inside an asteroid.\n\n===Continuity===\nAs the Doctor broadcasts her memories to escape the Matrix, the show uses numerous scenes from both the new series and the old, featuring each Doctor, several companions, and villains. Notably the flashback includes ''[[The Brain of Morbius]]'', a [[Fourth Doctor]] serial. In that story, while the Doctor and Morbius are hooked to a machine during a battle of wits, the machine briefly flashed up the former regenerations of the Doctor and several additional faces, then implied to be previous versions of the Doctor (in actuality, faces of some of the production crew). ''The Brain of Morbius'' producer Philip Hinchcliffe (who also played one of said faces) had said that was the implication of that scene then, but as they wrote in the twelve-regeneration limit, it became difficult to write that in future episodes and eventually became considered that these were in fact faces of Morbius. This scene from ''The Brain of Morbius'' is shown during the Doctor's flashback in this episode, finally identifying these as the faces of incarnations of the Timeless Child.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2020-03-01/doctor-who-more-doctors-morbius/ | title = Doctor Who\u2019s big reveal just solved a 44-year-old mystery | first = Morgan | last=  Jeffrey | date = 1 March 2020 | accessdate = 1 March 2020 | work = [[Radio Times]] }}</ref>\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\n\"The Timeless Children\" was written by [[Chris Chibnall]].<ref name=\"ChibnallEpisodes\">{{cite web|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/uk/tv/doctor-who/69159/doctor-who-series-12-will-start-and-end-with-two-parters|title=Doctor Who Series 12 will start and end with two-parters|date=27 December 2019|website=Denofgeek|accessdate=27 December 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"DWM 548\">{{cite web |url=https://cultbox.co.uk/general/doctor-who-magazine-reveals-titles-of-two-part-series-finale |title=Doctor Who Magazine reveals titles of two-part series finale |last=Laford |first=Andrew |publisher=Cultbox |date=6 February 2020 |accessdate=6 February 2020 }}</ref> Further episode details were announced in ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' #548 in early February 2020.<ref name=\"DWM 548\" />\n\n=== Casting ===\n\n[[Julie Graham]] was cast as Ravio in the episode.<ref name=\"DWM 548\" /> [[Ian McElhinney]] and [[Steve Toussaint]] were announced as guest stars in the two-part finale, \"Ascension of the Cybermen\" / \"The Timeless Children\"; however, Toussaint did not appear in this episode after his character was killed in the events of \"Ascension of the Cybermen\".<ref name=\"Toussaint\">{{cite web|url= https://cultbox.co.uk/news/ian-mcelhinney-and-steve-toussaint-to-guest-star-in-doctor-who-series-finale|title=Doctor Who Series 12: Ian McElhinney and Steve Toussaint to star in Doctor Who|date= 6 February 2020|website=CultBox|accessdate= 8 February 2020}}</ref> Jo Martin reprises her role from \"[[Fugitive of the Judoon]]\" as a regeneration of the Doctor.\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Jamie Magnus Stone]] directed the fifth block of the ninth and tenth episodes.<ref name=\"Directors\">{{cite web|url=http://cultbox.co.uk/news/doctor-who-series-12-new-directors-discovered|title=Doctor Who Series 12: new directors discovered|date=20 May 2019|website=CultBox}}</ref>\n\n== Broadcast and reception ==\n{{TV ratings\n| aggregatenosort = y\n| aggregate1 = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] (Tomatometer)\n| aggregate1score = 71%<ref name=\"Rotten Tomatoes\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/doctor_who/s12/e10|title=Doctor Who - Season 12 Episode 10|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=14 March 2020}}</ref>\n| aggregate2 = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] (Average Score)\n| aggregate2score = 6.33/10<ref name=\"Rotten Tomatoes\" />\n| rev1 = [[The A.V.

It was written by [[Chris Chibnall]], and directed by [[Jamie Magnus Stone]]. It is the second of a two-part story; the previous episode, \"[[Ascension of the Cybermen]]\", aired on 23 February.\n\nThe episode stars [[Jodie Whittaker]] as the [[Thirteenth Doctor]], alongside [[Bradley Walsh]], [[Tosin Cole]], and [[Mandip Gill]] as her [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companion]]s, Graham O'Brien, Ryan Sinclair and Yasmin Khan, respectively. The episode also stars [[Sacha Dhawan]] as [[The Master (Doctor Who)|The Master]].\n\nThe episode was watched by 4.69 million viewers, and received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe Master persuades the Doctor to join him on [[Gallifrey]], where he forces her to enter [[the Matrix (Doctor Who)|the Matrix]]. He shows her the secret history of Gallifrey and its native Shobogans. Tecteun, a space explorer, found a \"timeless child\" with infinite capacity to [[regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerate]]. She adopted the child and studied her, successfully grafting her regeneration capacity into the Shobogans, transforming them into Time Lords; they chose to limit a Time Lord's regenerations to twelve. The Master reveals that the Doctor is the \"timeless child\". Tecteun and the child were inducted into a clandestine organisation called the Division, the details of which were redacted from the Matrix. The Doctor's memories were subsequently erased, prior to the childhood she remembers; only snippets remain, masked as the story of the Irish policeman Brendan. \n\nWith the Doctor trapped in the Matrix, the Master lures Ashad to Gallifrey and shrinks him with his tissue compression eliminator, taking the Cyberium. With its knowledge and the bodies of the Time Lords he had killed on his arrival to Gallifrey, the Master creates a race of infinitely-regenerating Cybermen, aiming to use them to take over the universe. In the Matrix, a vision of the previously unseen Doctor from  \"Fugitive Of The Judoon\" restores the Doctor\u2019s belief in herself. The Doctor escapes by overloading the Matrix with all of her memories from her past incarnations.\n\nOn board the Cyber-carrier, Bescot is killed, while Yaz and Graham successfully hide from the invading Cybermen in empty Cyber-armor. They subsequently save the lives of Ryan, Ethan, and Ko Sharmus from Cybermen forces sent to the planet by Ashad. The group gather and agree to go through the portal to Gallifrey.\n\nThe Doctor regroups with her companions, and discovers Ashad's minaturised body contains a \"Death Particle\" capable of destroying all organic life on a planet. The Doctor and her friends blow up the Cyber-carrier, destroying Ashad's army in the process and foiling his plot to rebuild the Cyber-Empire. Finding unused TARDISes, she programs one to take her allies home. The Doctor takes one of Ko Sharmus' explosives to set off the particle. She is unable to trigger it when goaded by the Master, but Ko Sharmus appears and takes it, as penance for failing to suitably hide the Cyberium. The Doctor escapes in another TARDIS as the explosion consumes Gallifrey.\n\nThe Doctor's allies arrive on contemporary Earth in their TARDIS. The Doctor lands the other TARDIS near her own, but as she prepares to take off, she is arrested by the [[Judoon]] and teleported to a prison located inside an asteroid.\n\n===Continuity===\nAs the Doctor broadcasts her memories to escape the Matrix, the show uses numerous scenes from both the new series and the old, featuring each Doctor, several companions, and villains. Notably the flashback includes ''[[The Brain of Morbius]]'', a [[Fourth Doctor]] serial. In that story, while the Doctor and Morbius are hooked to a machine during a battle of wits, the machine briefly flashed up the former regenerations of the Doctor and several additional faces, then implied to be previous versions of the Doctor (in actuality, faces of some of the production crew). ''The Brain of Morbius'' producer Philip Hinchcliffe (who also played one of said faces) had said that was the implication of that scene then, but as they wrote in the twelve-regeneration limit, it became difficult to write that in future episodes and eventually became considered that these were in fact faces of Morbius. This scene from ''The Brain of Morbius'' is shown during the Doctor's flashback in this episode, finally identifying these as the faces of incarnations of the Timeless Child.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2020-03-01/doctor-who-more-doctors-morbius/ | title = Doctor Who\u2019s big reveal just solved a 44-year-old mystery | first = Morgan | last=  Jeffrey | date = 1 March 2020 | accessdate = 1 March 2020 | work = [[Radio Times]] }}</ref>\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\n\"The Timeless Children\" was written by [[Chris Chibnall]].<ref name=\"ChibnallEpisodes\">{{cite web|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/uk/tv/doctor-who/69159/doctor-who-series-12-will-start-and-end-with-two-parters|title=Doctor Who Series 12 will start and end with two-parters|date=27 December 2019|website=Denofgeek|accessdate=27 December 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"DWM 548\">{{cite web |url=https://cultbox.co.uk/general/doctor-who-magazine-reveals-titles-of-two-part-series-finale |title=Doctor Who Magazine reveals titles of two-part series finale |last=Laford |first=Andrew |publisher=Cultbox |date=6 February 2020 |accessdate=6 February 2020 }}</ref> Further episode details were announced in ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' #548 in early February 2020.<ref name=\"DWM 548\" />\n\n=== Casting ===\n\n[[Julie Graham]] was cast as Ravio in the episode.<ref name=\"DWM 548\" /> [[Ian McElhinney]] and [[Steve Toussaint]] were announced as guest stars in the two-part finale, \"Ascension of the Cybermen\" / \"The Timeless Children\"; however, Toussaint did not appear in this episode after his character was killed in the events of \"Ascension of the Cybermen\".<ref name=\"Toussaint\">{{cite web|url= https://cultbox.co.uk/news/ian-mcelhinney-and-steve-toussaint-to-guest-star-in-doctor-who-series-finale|title=Doctor Who Series 12: Ian McElhinney and Steve Toussaint to star in Doctor Who|date= 6 February 2020|website=CultBox|accessdate= 8 February 2020}}</ref> Jo Martin reprises her role from \"[[Fugitive of the Judoon]]\" as a regeneration of the Doctor.\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Jamie Magnus Stone]] directed the fifth block of the ninth and tenth episodes.<ref name=\"Directors\">{{cite web|url=http://cultbox.co.uk/news/doctor-who-series-12-new-directors-discovered|title=Doctor Who Series 12: new directors discovered|date=20 May 2019|website=CultBox}}</ref>\n\n== Broadcast and reception ==\n{{TV ratings\n| aggregatenosort = y\n| aggregate1 = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] (Tomatometer)\n| aggregate1score = 71%<ref name=\"Rotten Tomatoes\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/doctor_who/s12/e10|title=Doctor Who - Season 12 Episode 10|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=14 March 2020}}</ref>\n| aggregate2 = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] (Average Score)\n| aggregate2score = 6.33/10<ref name=\"Rotten Tomatoes\" />\n| rev1 = [[The A.V.

As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population of Opelika was 26,401,<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/> and in 2018 the estimated population was 30,555.<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\"/> The [[Auburn, Alabama, metropolitan area|Auburn-Opelika, AL MSA]] with a population of 150,933, along with the [[Columbus, Georgia metropolitan area]], comprises the [[Columbus\u2013Auburn\u2013Opelika, GA\u2013AL CSA|Greater Columbus]] combined statistical area, a region home to 501,649 residents.\n\n[[File:Historic Downtown Marker.jpg|thumb|Opelika's historic downtown]]\n\n==History==\nThe first white settlers in the area now known as Opelika arrived in the late 1830s and established a community called Lebanon. After the removal of the native Creek (Muscogee) peoples by federal troops in 1836\u201337, the area became known as \"Opelika.\" This word taken from the [[Creek language|Muskogee]] language means \"large swamp\".\n\nIn 1848, the Montgomery and West Point Railroad Company extended a rail line from [[Montgomery, Alabama]], to Opelika, and in 1851, completed a connection to [[West Point, Georgia]], thus connecting Opelika with [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. This line was the only direct rail route between [[New Orleans]] and the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]]. It rapidly became one of the primary trade lines for shipments of raw cotton from [[Southern United States|Southern]] plantations to the North. The Montgomery and West Point was soon joined by a rail connection to [[Columbus, Georgia]], in 1855, and a connection to [[Birmingham, Alabama]], in 1869. Almost overnight, Opelika became a regional hub for commerce.\n\nTo manage this rapid growth, Opelika was incorporated as a town on February 9, 1854, then within [[Russell County, Alabama|Russell County]]. As a result of Opelika's transportation infrastructure, many warehouses for storing cotton and other goods were built. With the onset of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], these warehouses were converted to [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] supply depots. In 1864 and 1865, Union raids commanded by [[Lovell Rousseau]] and [[James H. Wilson]] attacked Opelika, tearing up the railroads and destroying all government property, including Opelika's warehouses.\n\nSoon after the end of the war, the Alabama state legislature created a new county out of parts of [[Macon County, Alabama|Macon]], Russell, [[Chambers County, Alabama|Chambers]], and [[Tallapoosa County, Alabama|Tallapoosa]] Counties to be named after Confederate general [[Robert E. Lee]]. In 1866, citizens of the new \"[[Lee County, Alabama|Lee County]]\" voted Opelika as the county seat. The town was technically unincorporated after having its charter revoked for abetting the rebellion against the United States.\n\nAfter Opelika received a new charter in 1870, rapid growth resumed. The town nearly doubled in size between 1870 and 1900. During this time, Opelika began to gain a reputation as a wild, lawless town.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Soon after receiving the new charter, city officials attempted to scam outside investors by issuing fake railroad bonds. For this, the town's charter was revoked again in 1872, and the town was administered as a police district by the state legislature for the following year. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nOpelika's downtown was packed with [[bar (establishment)|saloons]] catering to railroad workers and other men. Frequent gunfire in the street by intoxicated patrons resulted in railroads directing their passengers to duck beneath the windows when their trains passed through the town.<ref name=\"nyt\">[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9806E0D6143DE533A25756C1A9649D94639FD7CF \"The Battle Of The Bar-rooms; Murderous Factions Fights In Alabama\u2014Death Of Maloney In Opelika\"], ''New York Times'', 15 December 1882, accessed 4 April 2016.</ref>\n\nIn 1882, two factions claimed to rule the city government, one known as the \"Bar room\" headed by Mayor Dunbar, a saloon keeper, and another known as the \"Citizens\". In a riot in late November\u2013December of that year, a dozen men were wounded. In the end, a few were killed. The Citizens had claimed control of the city via the elections, but Dunbar refused to give up. After continued violence, the state legislature revoked the city's charter and the governor sent in the [[militia]] to restore order. The legislature appointed five commissioners to manage the city,<ref name=\"nyt\"/> a situation that continued until 1899. That year, the legislature restored the city's charter.\n\n===1900 to present===\nIn 1900, local investors founded the Opelika Cotton Mill as the first textile plant in the city, employing 125. The city was located on the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|Fall Line]] of the Piedmont, where factories were established to take advantage of water power. Attempts to expand the textile industry in Opelika continued for the next three decades. In 1925, city officials used a $62,500 bribe to induce executives of the Pepperell Manufacturing Co. (now [[WestPoint Home]]) to construct a large mill just outside the city limits.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} From 1930 to 1970, Opelika continued industrialization, becoming a regional economic powerhouse.\n\nIn the 1950s, Opelika attracted the nation's first and largest magnetic tape manufacturing plant. In 1963, tire manufacturer [[Uniroyal]] constructed a massive plant in Opelika. Around the same time, Diversified Products revolutionized the physical fitness equipment industry with products produced in their Opelika plant. By the early 1970s, Opelika's industries employed nearly 10,000 people.\n\nBetween the late 1970s and 2005, nonagricultural employment in the Auburn-Opelika, AL, MSA grew at a slow and steady pace. Of the goods-producing industries, the metropolitan area has experienced the most change in manufacturing, which peaked in employment in the late 1980s. As many jobs moved offshore, employment declined, but this trend appears to be changing, as the number of manufacturing jobs has risen steadily since 2002.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Opelika purchased and developed the Northeast Opelika Industrial Park to increase its base. The {{convert|2200|acre|km2|adj=mid}} park site was purchased with funds from two bond issues, commonly called the 1998A and 1998B issues, totaling $10,280,000. Additional expenditures involved in constructing the Northeast Opelika Industrial Park included $4.3 million transferred from the city's general fund to the Opelika Industrial Development Authority (OIDA) between 1997 and 2000, a $1.9 million federal industrial park access road grant, $2.5 million from Opelika Water Works Board and the City of Opelika to sewer and water the park, $12.1 million from the Alabama Department of Transportation to construct an interchange. Additional expenditures were made by Tallapoosa Electric Cooperative for an electrical substation and by the OIDA for building construction for park tenants. Final expenditures for the land and development of the park totaled about $32 million. Since 1999, two major distribution centers, four tier-one automotive suppliers, Pharmavite, the global leader in the manufacturing and distribution of dietary supplements, and most recently Golden State Foods, one of the biggest service providers to McDonald's restaurants, including liquid products, and its third largest beef supplier in the U.S., have located within the park. The site has also attracted serious interest from automakers [[Audi]], [[Nissan]], and [[Hyundai Motor Group|Hyundai]]. In the summer of 2003, the park was recognized as one of the \"South's Best Automotive Assembly Plant Sites\" by ''Southern Business and Development,'' an industry trade publication.\n\nOpelika has had a related boom in retail development. TigerTown, a {{convert|130|acre|km2|adj=mid}} mixed-use development, is east Alabama's largest retail center with more than {{convert|1000000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of retail space. Located at the intersection of Interstate 85 and Highway 280 (exit 58) in Opelika and home to more than 70 businesses,  TigerTown's tenants include Home Depot, Target, Best Buy, Starbucks, Olive Garden, Kroger, PETCO, Office Depot, Dick's Sporting Goods, World Market, Hobby Lobby, Kohl's, Bed, Bath and Beyond, T.J. Maxx, Kroger, Old Navy, and more.\n\nOpelika's largest employer is the East Alabama Medical Center, which paid around $119 million in salaries and benefits to more than 2,700 employees in 2009.<ref>[https://www.eamc.org/includes/files/annualreport2009.pdf page 14]</ref>\n\nHistoric downtown Opelika has had an urban design revitalization in association with the national Main Street, Inc. program. With a compact historic district listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], downtown Opelika has attracted a variety of specialty shops, galleries, antique stores, and restaurants.\n\nWith industrial and retail growth has come an increase in population. From 2000 to 2010, Opelika grew from 23,638 to 26,617.<ref>Opelika population figures as recorded by the US Census Bureau (July 1 estimates base): 2000-23,638, 2001-23,636, 2002-23,579, 2003-23,597, 2004-23,483, 2005-23,804\n.</ref>\n\n[[File:Opelika City Hall Memorial.jpg|thumb|Memorial in front of Opelika City Hall]]\n\n==Law and government==\nOpelika is governed by a [[mayor-council government]], with a mayor and a five-member [[city council]].\n\nThe chief executive official of the city of Opelika is the mayor. The mayor is elected at-large for a four-year term. The mayor has complete executive power in the city, and can appoint and dismiss department heads at will.

Since 2004, the city has experienced revitalization in many segments of the economy, including commercial, residential and industrial activity. Since January 2005, the City of Opelika has announced new industry investments and existing industry expansions totaling 1.407 billion and 3717 additional jobs.<ref>http://www.opelikaeconomicdevelopment.org</ref>\nProjects include a {{convert|170000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} company named [[Daewon]].

Previously known as Gambro Renal Products, the Swedish-based manufacturer of dialyzers for kidney dialysis made the largest single initial investment in Lee County's history of $165.5 million in 2005. The company changed its name to Baxter after merging with Baxter International, Inc., an Illinois-based company that manufactures life-sustaining medical products including dialyzers, which act as filters for patients with end stage renal disease. In August 2014, Baxter announced plans for a $300 million expansion of its state-of-the-art facility in Opelika, that added {{convert|230000|sqft|m2}} and several production lines, and created an additional 200 jobs. As of June 2019, Baxter has a total capital investment of $465.5 million and total job creation is 360.\n\nMando America Corp. has also been very successful in Opelika and continues to grow and prosper. An expansion announcement in April 2012 of approximately $24 million brought Mando's total investment in Opelika to nearly $160 million. Along with the $24 million investment, Mando promised 30 more jobs, increasing the total number of employees to over 600 and making them one of the largest employers in Opelika. In June 2013, Mando announced an additional investment of $35 million for equipment and building improvements over the next three years with plans to hire an additional 67 employees to support the expansion. In 2019, Mando announced an additional $9.6 million expansion and 23 new jobs. This brought Mando's total investment in Opelika to over $218.6 million and their employment total to more than 700.

The food site designation experts presented the Opelika Industrial Development Authority with the certification, stating the site is an ideal location for food and beverage processing, cold storage or food distribution facilities. The certification is aimed to attract new food-based companies to the Northeast Opelika Industrial Park and ultimately create additional jobs for the City of Opelika.\n\nDuring the summer of 2015, Cumberland Plastic Solutions took possession of the former Benteler Automotive facility and invested over $2 million worth of building improvements and repairs to bring the facility up to par as a state-of- the-art injection molding manufacturing plant. Cumberland is a privately held custom injection molding company employing over 150 employees and supplies locale OEMs such as Briggs & Stratton and automotive manufacturers Mercedes, Nissan and BM with various plastic components.

One part of the reason this area received this ranking is that Opelika is home to Robert Trent Jones Grand National. The site for the course, which hugs the edge of Lake Saugahatchee in Opelika's northwest, was described by Jones as the \"single greatest\" site for a golf complex that he had ever seen. The course, which is considered to be the jewel of Alabama's [[Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail]], has hosted a number of national tournaments, including the 1997 Nike Tour championship, the 1998 LPGA Tournament of Champions, and the 2000 NCAA Men's Division 1 National Championship. \nRobert Trent Jones Grand National also served as the tournament host for the first PGA Tour tournament in Alabama since 1990, the [[Barbasol Championship]], held the same week as [[The Open Championship]].<ref>http://www.pgatour.com/company/2014/08/11/barbasol-championship-pga-tour-2015.html</ref> Another reason that the Auburn-Opelika MSA was named the #1 area for golf in the United States was for the local public golf courses like Indian Pines Golf Course in Opelika. Indian Pines Golf Course is an 18-hole public golf course that has a par 71 course with summer Bermuda grass and a bentgrass/ryegrass mix in the winter.\n\nThe Alabama Recreation and Parks Association awarded the Opelika Sportsplex and Aquatics Center the 2010 Facility of the Year Award for cities with populations of 15,001 people or more.\n\nThe City of Opelika was honored by the Alabama League of Municipalities at the Statewide conference in May, 2010.  At that conference the League presented the City of Opelika with the 2010 \"Municipal Quality of Life Award\" for the city's new Sportsplex & Aquatics Center.  In their remarks, league leaders noted \"Your exemplary program demonstrates a strong commitment to improving the quality of life in the City of Opelika...your program exhibits the type of innovation that the National League of Cities is looking to recognize.\"\nThis $32 million, {{convert|75,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} complex is the largest project ever undertaken by the City of Opelika in its 155-year history,  representing the first-ever public-private partnership, with businesses, corporations and private individuals.\nThe idea began with a survey that was conducted in the early 2000s (decade) that concluded that the citizens of Opelika wanted a \"family oriented\" facility that would offer a wide variety of activities where everyone could have fun together. The city's governing body set out to make the dream a reality, and soon resolutions were passed by the city council authorizing the city to move forward with the plans.\nOn February 21, 2008, after years of preparation and fundraising, groundbreaking ceremonies were held.  On August 31, 2009 \u2013 on schedule and on budget \u2013 Opelika's new state-of-the-art Sportsplex & Aquatics Center opened its doors to the public.\n\nThe Lewis Cooper Jr. Memorial Library in Opelika received the 2019 Gold Standard Award for Public Libraries. Public libraries that receive the Gold Award serve as benchmarks for other public libraries across the state. Libraries are rated on facility, planning, administration and governance, collection, services, technology and several other categories. The award was given by the Public Libraries Division of the Alabama Library Association (ALLA).\n\nThe City of Opelika opened is first official dog park in April 2018. Floral Dog Park is located at 600 Floral Street, Opelika, Alabama, 36801.  The small dog area is approximately 8,000 square feet and the large dog area is approximately 18,000 square feet. The dog park includes double entry fencing, signage, seating, pet waste systems and ADA compliance access to parking area. In addition, the Stern Foundation donated a second dog and walking park to the City in 2018.  The City moved the Caboose to Stern Park so that children of all ages could enjoy.\n\nThe Opelika SportsPlex and Aquatics Center houses five full regulation soccer fields, including one championship field with two concession stands and two sets of bathrooms. The SportsPlex soccer fields are home to the Opelika Parks and Recreation Spring and Fall Soccer programs, Opelika Crush Soccer Team and the Opelika City Schools soccer teams.\n \nIn 2019, 12 new regulation pickleball courts were built at the Opelika SportsPlex and Aquatics Center. Each court is individually fenced for tournament style play. The entire facility is lighted and covered and features ample parking.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1880= 3245\n|1890= 3703\n|1900= 4245\n|1910= 4734\n|1920= 4960\n|1930= 6156\n|1940= 8487\n|1950= 12295\n|1960= 15678\n|1970= 19027\n|1980= 21896\n|1990= 22122\n|2000= 23498\n|2010= 26477\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=30555\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 6, 2013}}</ref><br />2018 Estimate<ref name=\"2018 Pop Estimate\">{{cite web|title=Population Estimates|url=https://census.gov/data/tables/2018/demo/popest/total-cities-and-towns.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=June 8, 2018}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAccording to the [[2010 United States Census|2010 Census]] (SF1, 100% data), there were 26,477 people, 10,523 occupied housing units (households), and 7,078 family households residing in the city.

As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population of Opelika was 26,401,<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/> and in 2018 the estimated population was 30,555.<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\"/> The [[Auburn, Alabama, metropolitan area|Auburn-Opelika, AL MSA]] with a population of 150,933, along with the [[Columbus, Georgia metropolitan area]], comprises the [[Columbus\u2013Auburn\u2013Opelika, GA\u2013AL CSA|Greater Columbus]] combined statistical area, a region home to 501,649 residents.\n\n[[File:Historic Downtown Marker.jpg|thumb|Opelika's historic downtown]]\n\n==History==\nThe first white settlers in the area now known as Opelika arrived in the late 1830s and established a community called Lebanon. After the removal of the native Creek (Muscogee) peoples by federal troops in 1836\u201337, the area became known as \"Opelika.\" This word taken from the [[Creek language|Muskogee]] language means \"large swamp\".\n\nIn 1848, the Montgomery and West Point Railroad Company extended a rail line from [[Montgomery, Alabama]], to Opelika, and in 1851, completed a connection to [[West Point, Georgia]], thus connecting Opelika with [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. This line was the only direct rail route between [[New Orleans]] and the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]]. It rapidly became one of the primary trade lines for shipments of raw cotton from [[Southern United States|Southern]] plantations to the North. The Montgomery and West Point was soon joined by a rail connection to [[Columbus, Georgia]], in 1855, and a connection to [[Birmingham, Alabama]], in 1869. Almost overnight, Opelika became a regional hub for commerce.\n\nTo manage this rapid growth, Opelika was incorporated as a town on February 9, 1854, then within [[Russell County, Alabama|Russell County]]. As a result of Opelika's transportation infrastructure, many warehouses for storing cotton and other goods were built. With the onset of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], these warehouses were converted to [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] supply depots. In 1864 and 1865, Union raids commanded by [[Lovell Rousseau]] and [[James H. Wilson]] attacked Opelika, tearing up the railroads and destroying all government property, including Opelika's warehouses.\n\nSoon after the end of the war, the Alabama state legislature created a new county out of parts of [[Macon County, Alabama|Macon]], Russell, [[Chambers County, Alabama|Chambers]], and [[Tallapoosa County, Alabama|Tallapoosa]] Counties to be named after Confederate general [[Robert E. Lee]]. In 1866, citizens of the new \"[[Lee County, Alabama|Lee County]]\" voted Opelika as the county seat. The town was technically unincorporated after having its charter revoked for abetting the rebellion against the United States.\n\nAfter Opelika received a new charter in 1870, rapid growth resumed. The town nearly doubled in size between 1870 and 1900. During this time, Opelika began to gain a reputation as a wild, lawless town.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Soon after receiving the new charter, city officials attempted to scam outside investors by issuing fake railroad bonds. For this, the town's charter was revoked again in 1872, and the town was administered as a police district by the state legislature for the following year. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nOpelika's downtown was packed with [[bar (establishment)|saloons]] catering to railroad workers and other men. Frequent gunfire in the street by intoxicated patrons resulted in railroads directing their passengers to duck beneath the windows when their trains passed through the town.<ref name=\"nyt\">[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9806E0D6143DE533A25756C1A9649D94639FD7CF \"The Battle Of The Bar-rooms; Murderous Factions Fights In Alabama\u2014Death Of Maloney In Opelika\"], ''New York Times'', 15 December 1882, accessed 4 April 2016.</ref>\n\nIn 1882, two factions claimed to rule the city government, one known as the \"Bar room\" headed by Mayor Dunbar, a saloon keeper, and another known as the \"Citizens\". In a riot in late November\u2013December of that year, a dozen men were wounded. In the end, a few were killed. The Citizens had claimed control of the city via the elections, but Dunbar refused to give up. After continued violence, the state legislature revoked the city's charter and the governor sent in the [[militia]] to restore order. The legislature appointed five commissioners to manage the city,<ref name=\"nyt\"/> a situation that continued until 1899. That year the legislature restored the city's charter.\n\n===1900 to present===\nIn 1900, local investors founded the Opelika Cotton Mill as the first textile plant in the city, employing 125. The city was located on the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|Fall Line]] of the Piedmont, where factories were established to take advantage of water power. Attempts to expand the textile industry in Opelika continued for the next three decades. In 1925, city officials used a $62,500 bribe to induce executives of the Pepperell Manufacturing Co. (now [[WestPoint Home]]) to construct a large mill just outside the city limits.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} From 1930 to 1970, Opelika continued industrialization, becoming a regional economic powerhouse.\n\nIn the 1950s, Opelika attracted the nation's first and largest magnetic tape manufacturing plant. In 1963, tire manufacturer [[Uniroyal]] constructed a massive plant in Opelika. Around the same time, Diversified Products revolutionized the physical fitness equipment industry with products produced in their Opelika plant. By the early 1970s, Opelika's industries employed nearly 10,000 people.\n\nBetween the late 1970s and 2005, nonagricultural employment in the Auburn-Opelika, AL, MSA grew at a slow and steady pace. Of the goods-producing industries, the metropolitan area has experienced the most change in manufacturing, which peaked in employment in the late 1980s. As many jobs moved offshore, employment declined, but this trend appears to be changing, as the number of manufacturing jobs has risen steadily since 2002.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Opelika purchased and developed the Northeast Opelika Industrial Park to increase its base. The {{convert|2200|acre|km2|adj=mid}} park site was purchased with funds from two bond issues, commonly called the 1998A and 1998B issues, totaling $10,280,000. Additional expenditures involved in constructing the Northeast Opelika Industrial Park included $4.3 million transferred from the city's general fund to the Opelika Industrial Development Authority (OIDA) between 1997 and 2000, a $1.9 million federal industrial park access road grant, $2.5 million from Opelika Water Works Board and the City of Opelika to sewer and water the park, $12.1 million from the Alabama Department of Transportation to construct an interchange. Additional expenditures were made by Tallapoosa Electric Cooperative for an electrical substation and by the OIDA for building construction for park tenants. Final expenditures for the land and development of the park totaled about $32 million. Since 1999, two major distribution centers, four tier-one automotive suppliers, Pharmavite, the global leader in the manufacturing and distribution of dietary supplements, and most recently Golden State Foods, one of the biggest service providers to McDonald's restaurants, including liquid products, and its third largest beef supplier in the U.S., have located within the park. The site has also attracted serious interest from automakers [[Audi]], [[Nissan]], and [[Hyundai Motor Group|Hyundai]].

Her mother, Bonnie Plunkett, ([[Allison Janney]]) is also a recovering addict. Christy's daughter, Violet ([[Sadie Calvano]]), who was born when Christy was 17, has also become a teen mother by her boyfriend, Luke ([[Spencer Daniels]]). Christy also has a young son, Roscoe (Blake Garrett Rosenthal) by her ex-husband, Baxter ([[Matt L. Jones|Matt Jones]]), a deadbeat but likable pothead.\n\nChristy has gone back to school and is pursuing her dream of becoming a lawyer, while Bonnie attempts to have a healthy romantic relationship with her new husband, Adam ([[William Fichtner]]). Through it all, Christy and Bonnie rely on their support system from AA, including the wise Marjorie ([[Mimi Kennedy]]), the wealthy and sometimes misguided Jill ([[Jaime Pressly]]), the overly-emotional Wendy ([[Beth Hall]]), and the loudmouthed but sweet Tammy ([[Kristen Johnston]]). Collectively, they help each other stay sober in the face of whatever life throws at them.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Mom episodes}}\n{{:List of Mom episodes}}\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Main===\n* [[Anna Faris]] as Christy Jolene Plunkett: a single narcissist mother who has gone six years without drinking and is still struggling with sobriety and a concurrent addiction to gambling. Now sober, she strives to be a good example to her son Roscoe, and regain the trust of her daughter Violet, who is revealed to be pregnant herself in the first episode. In addition, she is trying to iron out the rough edges in her relationship with her mother Bonnie, who she still struggles to forgive after a tumultuous childhood and long estrangement. Christy later finds out that her biological father, Alvin, ran out on Bonnie after she was discharged from the hospital on Christmas Eve after giving birth to Christy. She locates Alvin and finds out that he is a married father of two sons and runs an auto repair shop. Christy eventually develops a bond with Alvin, whom she introduces to her family, and comes to see him as the father she needs in her life. Like her mother, Christy also became a teenage mother when she had Violet at age 16\u201317. Violet's father Butch was horribly [[Domestic violence|physically abusive]] to Christy, who tried to leave him on numerous occasions, only to get cold feet. Christy finally worked up the courage to leave him in order to protect Violet. A former stripper, Christy is mostly seen working as a waitress. She is briefly promoted to manager (after Claudia divorces Gabriel), but eventually goes back to being a waitress. Christy later decides that she wants to go back to school to eventually become a lawyer, and she takes a second job working as an assistant for Steve Casper, eventually earning her bachelor's degree and then being accepted to law school. \n* [[Allison Janney]] as Bonnie Plunkett: Christy's mother, a joyful if cynical recovering addict. She tries to regain the love and trust of her daughter, whom she was unable to properly nurture as a child. She was given up for adoption at age four and was in the foster care system, being passed around from house to house where she eventually ran off with Alvin at age 15. She ended up pregnant and had Christy at age 17. Alvin abandoned both of them at the hospital on Christmas Eve. Bonnie has said that she almost aborted Christy and wanted to put Christy up for adoption. A pleasant Jewish couple was going to adopt her, yet Bonnie could not go through with the adoption. From that point on, she attempted her best to raise Christy. However, Christy wound up raising herself as Bonnie preferred to party and drink rather than stay home. With time and much therapy, Bonnie managed to find the balance and now wants to catch up, revealing to Christy her past, including who her real father is and how to find him, as well as her past side career as a drug dealer. She suffered a relapse in season 1 after losing her job and apartment and had to move in with Christy, Violet, and Roscoe. After Christy reconnected with her biological father Alvin, Bonnie slowly realized that she still had feelings for him, and the two began to date at the beginning of season 2. This was cut short after Alvin suffered a heart attack and died, leaving his family shocked. After suffering from a back injury, Bonnie became hooked on pain medication prescribed to her, which led to another relapse. In season 3, she met her biological mother, and in season 4 she met her half-brother Ray after their mother died. She currently manages the apartment building where she and Christy live. In season 6, she was diagnosed with [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]] and began seeing a therapist to deal with it. \n* [[Sadie Calvano]] as Violet Plunkett (main, seasons 1\u20133; recurring, season 4; guest, season 6): Christy's daughter and older half-sister of Roscoe. A senior in high school at the beginning of the series, Violet is hardworking, smart and sure of herself, though upset with her mother, who never had time to take care of her children and failed to fulfill a true motherly role despite now being sober for some time. After having her boyfriend Luke's baby, Violet made the decision to place her baby for adoption because she felt that this was the best way to break her family's repeated cycle of poor life choices and give her child a better chance than herself, her mother, or her grandmother ever had. Violet's father was physically abusive to Christy, and Christy has lied to Violet concerning his whereabouts, taking her to a random man's grave and telling Violet that her father is dead. During season 2, in a brief downward spiral of bad behavior, Violet cheats on Luke and he breaks up with her. She later gets engaged to Gregory Munchnik, a much older psychology professor at her university, but he breaks the engagement after she begins to party too hard, leaving her mother and grandmother wondering if she was just experiencing young life or developing a problem. Violet moves back in with Christy and Bonnie after her break up and after demanding that she get a job, Violet moves to Lake Tahoe to become a blackjack dealer at [[Harrah's]]. Violet, yet again, moves back to her mother and grandmother after wrecking her life in Lake Tahoe and gets back together and moves in with Luke after seeing that he has improved his life. Violet returns in Season 6 as the host of a successful podcast called \"The Mother of all Problems\" where she outlines in great detail all of Christy's terrible past actions; it is revealed that Christy and Violet haven't talked in over a year (though she remains in contact with Bonnie), and while Violet lets Christy on her podcast and gives her credit for turning her life around, she bluntly says that the past can't be changed and she thinks it's healthier to have no relationship with Christy in the future. In Season 7, Christy sadly confirms to Bonnie's new sponsee that she doesn't have a relationship at present with Violet.\n* [[Nate Corddry]] as Gabriel (main, seasons 1\u20132): the manager of the restaurant where Christy works. Married to a domineering woman who scares him somewhat, Gabriel and Christy are carrying on an affair which Christy later ends but which Gabriel himself frequently and desperately tries to renew: they briefly resume their affair in season 2 when Christy is promoted as his replacement. He is a hardworking, competent manager, but often put in his place by his subordinates, particularly Chef Rudy.\n* [[Matt L. Jones|Matt Jones]] as Baxter (main, seasons 1\u20133; recurring, season 4; guest, seasons 5\u20136): Christy's ex-husband and the father of Roscoe. Sweet and charming, but very unstable, he is unable to maintain a serious relationship or steady work for much longer than a month. Loves easy life and frequently gets into fraudulent deals to make money. Despite his flaws, he is a loving father who usually comes through for his son. During season 2, under the influence of his wealthy new girlfriend Candace, Baxter gives up his slacker ways and becomes a car salesman, and is content to be an ersatz \"trophy husband\".\n* [[French Stewart]] as Chef Rudy (main, seasons 1\u20132; guest, seasons 3, 5\u20137): the head chef for the Rustic Fig restaurant, where Christy works as a waitress. A dominant and difficult [[self-made man]], Rudy acts superior in his relationships with others. He sells drugs out of the freezer and is boastful and arrogant, often yelling at his subordinates without mincing words, and will not hesitate to humiliate anyone who opposes him. He is secretive about his past and distant from people, but briefly dates Bonnie and is revealed to be a [[bisexual]] fetishist with expensive tastes and hobbies who steals food from the restaurant. Tammy is his most recent love interest.\n* [[Spencer Daniels]] as Luke (main, seasons 1\u20132; guest, season 4): a young student who loves to enjoy life and adventure. He had been dating Violet for a little over a year and got her pregnant. Luke is considerably airheaded, smoking marijuana often, but always tries to prove to Christy that he is not as crazy as he appears: he seems to genuinely love Violet, staying beside her and supporting her throughout her pregnancy, and he is often more sensitive towards Christy than her own children are, perhaps because his parents are religious fundamentalists with whom he does not connect. In season 2, Violet, during her downward spiral, cheated on Luke and he broke up with Violet. By season 4, Luke has apparently cleaned himself up and got a high-paying job with a video game company, driving Violet to get back together with him. Violet reveals in season 6 that she and Luke have ended their relationship.\n* Blake Garrett Rosenthal as Roscoe Plunkett (main, seasons 1\u20133; recurring, season 4): Christy's son by Baxter and half-brother of Violet. He experimented with marijuana at age twelve. He has not appeared since season 4, and it is stated he went to live with Baxter and his new wife Candace (which Christy confirms in season 7). However, in \"Beef Baloney Dan and a Sarcastic No\", it is heavily implied that Christy still has an on-going relationship with her son, as it is revealed that he still texts her.  \n* [[Mimi Kennedy]] as Marjorie Armstrong-Perugian (recurring, season 1; main, season 2\u2013present):<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/cbs-mom-promotes-mimi-kennedy-698933|title=CBS' 'Mom' Promotes Mimi Kennedy to Series Regular (Exclusive)|last=Goldberg|first=Lesley|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=April 25, 2014|accessdate=April 25, 2014}}</ref> Christy's and Bonnie's AA sponsor who loves [[cat|cats]]. She had problems with alcohol and drugs in the past, was a [[groupie]] (it is intimated in one episode she slept with [[Jimi Hendrix]]), spent some time in prison, was homeless for a period of time, and is a mother to a son whom she had no relationship or contact with for years, until Christy convinced him to reconnect with Marjorie following her cancer diagnosis. She was diagnosed with [[breast cancer]] in season 1, and after extensive treatment finally beats it at the end of season 2. Through Christy she meets Victor Perugian, Christy's former landlord, whom she eventually weds and then cares for after he suffers a stroke. When Victor dies, her vulnerable side is revealed, and the women do their best to help Marjorie cope with being widowed for the second time (her first husband having died before the start of the show, after three decades of marriage.)\n* [[Jaime Pressly]] as Jill Kendall (recurring, season 2; main, season 3\u2013present):<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2015/03/jaime-pressly-joins-mom-cast-new-regular-1201391977/|title=Jaime Pressly Named New 'Mom' Regular|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|work=Deadline|date=March 13, 2015|accessdate=March 13, 2015}}</ref> A wealthy [[socialite]] and alcoholic. Christy first met her at an AA meeting and decided to sponsor her. Jill suffered several relapses before becoming sober. Her mother had struggled with depression and alcoholism before committing suicide when Jill was a teenager. Jill carried this pain with her throughout her life, culminating in season 4, when she was overcome with grief on the anniversary of her mother's death. After trying to become pregnant and miscarrying, Jill decides to adopt a foster child. She is eventually given a teenage girl named Emily, but Christy helps her mother become sober at the start of season 5, leading to Emily leaving Jill. This caused Jill to overeat, leading her to gain weight (this was to cover up Pressly's pregnancy during the fifth season). After an extended stay at a health spa, she returns in the later half of season 5 and suffers another relapse. Despite being vain and obsessed with how her peers view her, she is shown to genuinely care about her friends and use her experiences to help them with their own problems. In season 6 she began a relationship with Andy, a police officer and former Marine who provided private home security services at Jill's home after it was broken into.\n* [[Beth Hall]] as Wendy Harris (recurring, season 2; main, season 3\u2013present):<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2015/05/29/mom-season-3-cast-changes-beth-hall-wendy/|title=Mom Season 3: Who's In?

In \"A Pirate, Three Frogs, and a Prince\", Wendy was revealed to be both bisexual/pansexual/bicurious, and attracted to Bonnie.\n* [[William Fichtner]] as Adam Janikowski (recurring, season 3; main, season 4\u2013present):<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2016/06/24/mom-season-4-william-fichtner-series-regular-adam/|title=Mom Promotes William Fichtner to Series Regular for Season 4|last=Mason|first=Charlie|work=TV Line|date=June 24, 2016|accessdate=June 24, 2016}}</ref> Bonnie's latest love interest and later husband, a wheelchair-bound ex-[[stuntman]] whom she met over the phone after he dialed the wrong number.

When Christy found Alvin he was married with two sons. Despite that, he loves Christy and does what he can to be in her life and help out, including fixing up a used car to give her and attempting to reach out to her children as a grandfather. He and Bonnie initially treated each other with contempt and hatred over the various mistakes each of them has made in their past, but they rekindled their relationship after his wife left him and he survived a heart attack. In season 2, Alvin suffers a second, fatal heart attack while in bed with Bonnie.\n* [[Octavia Spencer]] as Regina Tompkins (seasons 1\u20133): A fellow AA member and money manager who embezzled from her clients and faces a long prison sentence. While a close if questionable friend to Christy, Regina and Bonnie typically hold each other in contempt, but beneath the surface, they bear some affection for each other. In the middle of season 2, she is given early parole and becomes a born-again Christian, eventually moving in with Jill.

He has a casual sex relationship with Bonnie in season 3. In season 4, he is shown to be in Mexico, hiding from trouble with a drug cartel.\n* [[Sara Rue]] as Candace Hayes (seasons 2\u20134): Baxter's wealthy new wife, who she reformed. She delivers many subtle jabs at Christy's poverty and seems to be trying to force Christy aside to replace her as Roscoe's mother. The hostility becomes much more obvious in season 3, when Candace's wealthy father, Fred ([[Harry Hamlin]]), briefly dates Christy and Candace accuses Christy of only being with him for his money. Christy breaks up with Fred because he openly insults and mocks Candace for doing nothing but living off his wealth. When Candace (wrongly and smugly) smirks that Fred dumped her, Christy gives Candace a hug and shuts her up by saying \"I know why you're such a bitch.\"\n* [[Jonny Coyne]] as Victor Perugian (seasons 2\u20134): Christy's Armenian former landlord who becomes attracted to Marjorie, marrying her in season 3.

Her mother, Bonnie Plunkett, ([[Allison Janney]]) is also a recovering addict. Christy's daughter, Violet ([[Sadie Calvano]]), who was born when Christy was 17, has also become a teen mother by her boyfriend, Luke ([[Spencer Daniels]]). Christy also has a young son, Roscoe (Blake Garrett Rosenthal) by her ex-husband, Baxter ([[Matt L. Jones|Matt Jones]]), a deadbeat but likable pothead.\n\nChristy has gone back to school and is pursuing her dream of becoming a lawyer, while Bonnie attempts to have a healthy romantic relationship with her new husband, Adam ([[William Fichtner]]). Through it all, Christy and Bonnie rely on their support system from AA, including the wise Marjorie ([[Mimi Kennedy]]), the wealthy and sometimes misguided Jill ([[Jaime Pressly]]), the overly-emotional Wendy ([[Beth Hall]]), and the loudmouthed but sweet Tammy ([[Kristen Johnston]]). Collectively, they help each other stay sober in the face of whatever life throws at them.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Mom episodes}}\n{{:List of Mom episodes}}\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Main===\n* [[Anna Faris]] as Christy Jolene Plunkett: a single narcissist mother who has gone six years without drinking and is still struggling with sobriety and a concurrent addiction to gambling. Now sober, she strives to be a good example to her son Roscoe, and regain the trust of her daughter Violet, who is revealed to be pregnant herself in the first episode. In addition, she is trying to iron out the rough edges in her relationship with her mother Bonnie, who she still struggles to forgive after a tumultuous childhood and long estrangement. Christy later finds out that her biological father, Alvin, ran out on Bonnie after she was discharged from the hospital on Christmas Eve after giving birth to Christy. She locates Alvin and finds out that he is a married father of two sons and runs an auto repair shop. Christy eventually develops a bond with Alvin, whom she introduces to her family, and comes to see him as the father she needs in her life. Like her mother, Christy also became a teenage mother when she had Violet at age 16\u201317. Violet's father Butch was horribly [[Domestic violence|physically abusive]] to Christy, who tried to leave him on numerous occasions, only to get cold feet. Christy finally worked up the courage to leave him in order to protect Violet. A former stripper, Christy is mostly seen working as a waitress. She is briefly promoted to manager (after Claudia divorces Gabriel), but eventually goes back to being a waitress. Christy later decides that she wants to go back to school to eventually become a lawyer, and she takes a second job working as an assistant for Steve Casper, eventually earning her bachelor's degree and then being accepted to law school. \n* [[Allison Janney]] as Bonnie Plunkett: Christy's mother, a joyful if cynical recovering addict. She tries to regain the love and trust of her daughter, whom she was unable to properly nurture as a child. She was given up for adoption at age four and was in the foster care system, being passed around from house to house where she eventually ran off with Alvin at age 15. She ended up pregnant and had Christy at age 17. Alvin abandoned both of them at the hospital on Christmas Eve. Bonnie has said that she almost aborted Christy and wanted to put Christy up for adoption. A pleasant Jewish couple was going to adopt her, yet Bonnie could not go through with the adoption. From that point on, she attempted her best to raise Christy. However, Christy wound up raising herself as Bonnie preferred to party and drink rather than stay home. With time and much therapy, Bonnie managed to find the balance and now wants to catch up, revealing to Christy her past, including who her real father is and how to find him, as well as her past side career as a drug dealer. She suffered a relapse in season 1 after losing her job and apartment and had to move in with Christy, Violet, and Roscoe. After Christy reconnected with her biological father Alvin, Bonnie slowly realized that she still had feelings for him, and the two began to date at the beginning of season 2. This was cut short after Alvin suffered a heart attack and died, leaving his family shocked. After suffering from a back injury, Bonnie became hooked on pain medication prescribed to her, which led to another relapse. In season 3, she met her biological mother, and in season 4 she met her half-brother Ray after their mother died. She currently manages the apartment building where she and Christy live. In season 6, she was diagnosed with [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]] and began seeing a therapist to deal with it. \n* [[Sadie Calvano]] as Violet Plunkett (main, seasons 1\u20133; recurring, season 4; guest, season 6): Christy's daughter and older half-sister of Roscoe. A senior in high school at the beginning of the series, Violet is hardworking, smart and sure of herself, though upset with her mother, who never had time to take care of her children and failed to fulfill a true motherly role despite now being sober for some time. After having her boyfriend Luke's baby, Violet made the decision to place her baby for adoption because she felt that this was the best way to break her family's repeated cycle of poor life choices and give her child a better chance than herself, her mother, or her grandmother ever had. Violet's father was physically abusive to Christy, and Christy has lied to Violet concerning his whereabouts, taking her to a random man's grave and telling Violet that her father is dead. During season 2, in a brief downward spiral of bad behavior, Violet cheats on Luke and he breaks up with her. She later gets engaged to Gregory Munchnik, a much older psychology professor at her university, but he breaks the engagement after she begins to party too hard, leaving her mother and grandmother wondering if she was just experiencing young life or developing a problem. Violet moves back in with Christy and Bonnie after her break up and after demanding that she get a job, Violet moves to Lake Tahoe to become a blackjack dealer at [[Harrah's]]. Violet, yet again, moves back to her mother and grandmother after wrecking her life in Lake Tahoe and gets back together and moves in with Luke after seeing that he has improved his life. Violet returns in Season 6 as the host of a successful podcast called \"The Mother of all Problems\" where she outlines in great detail all of Christy's terrible past actions; it is revealed that Christy and Violet haven't talked in over a year (though she remains in contact with Bonnie), and while Violet lets Christy on her podcast and gives her credit for turning her life around, she bluntly says that the past can't be changed and she thinks it's healthier to have no relationship with Christy in the future. In Season 7, Christy sadly confirms to Bonnie's new sponsee that she doesn't have a relationship at present with Violet.\n* [[Nate Corddry]] as Gabriel (main, seasons 1\u20132): the manager of the restaurant where Christy works. Married to a domineering woman who scares him somewhat, Gabriel and Christy are carrying on an affair which Christy later ends but which Gabriel himself frequently and desperately tries to renew: they briefly resume their affair in season 2 when Christy is promoted as his replacement. He is a hardworking, competent manager, but often put in his place by his subordinates, particularly Chef Rudy.\n* [[Matt L. Jones|Matt Jones]] as Baxter (main, seasons 1\u20133; recurring, season 4; guest, seasons 5\u20136): Christy's ex-husband and the father of Roscoe. Sweet and charming, but very unstable, he is unable to maintain a serious relationship or steady work for much longer than a month. Loves easy life and frequently gets into fraudulent deals to make money. Despite his flaws, he is a loving father who usually comes through for his son. During season 2, under the influence of his wealthy new girlfriend Candace, Baxter gives up his slacker ways and becomes a car salesman, and is content to be an ersatz \"trophy husband\".\n* [[French Stewart]] as Chef Rudy (main, seasons 1\u20132; guest, seasons 3, 5\u20137): the head chef for the Rustic Fig restaurant, where Christy works as a waitress. A dominant and difficult [[self-made man]], Rudy acts superior in his relationships with others. He sells drugs out of the freezer and is boastful and arrogant, often yelling at his subordinates without mincing words, and will not hesitate to humiliate anyone who opposes him. He is secretive about his past and distant from people, but briefly dates Bonnie and is revealed to be a [[bisexual]] fetishist with expensive tastes and hobbies who steals food from the restaurant. Tammy is his most recent love interest.\n* [[Spencer Daniels]] as Luke (main, seasons 1\u20132; guest, season 4): a young student who loves to enjoy life and adventure. He had been dating Violet for a little over a year and got her pregnant. Luke is considerably airheaded, smoking marijuana often, but always tries to prove to Christy that he is not as crazy as he appears: he seems to genuinely love Violet, staying beside her and supporting her throughout her pregnancy, and he is often more sensitive towards Christy than her own children are, perhaps because his parents are religious fundamentalists with whom he does not connect. In season 2, Violet, during her downward spiral, cheated on Luke and he broke up with Violet. By season 4, Luke has apparently cleaned himself up and got a high-paying job with a video game company, driving Violet to get back together with him. Violet reveals in season 6 that she and Luke have ended their relationship.\n* Blake Garrett Rosenthal as Roscoe Plunkett (main, seasons 1\u20133; recurring, season 4): Christy's son by Baxter and half-brother of Violet. He experimented with marijuana at age twelve. He has not appeared since season 4, and it is stated he went to live with Baxter and his new wife Candace (which Christy confirms in season 7). However, in \"Beef Baloney Dan and a Sarcastic No\", it is heavily implied that Christy still has an on-going relationship with her son, as it is revealed that he still texts her.  \n* [[Mimi Kennedy]] as Marjorie Armstrong-Perugian (recurring, season 1; main, season 2\u2013present):<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/cbs-mom-promotes-mimi-kennedy-698933|title=CBS' 'Mom' Promotes Mimi Kennedy to Series Regular (Exclusive)|last=Goldberg|first=Lesley|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=April 25, 2014|accessdate=April 25, 2014}}</ref> Christy's and Bonnie's AA sponsor who loves [[cat|cats]]. She had problems with alcohol and drugs in the past, was a [[groupie]] (it is intimated in one episode she slept with [[Jimi Hendrix]]), spent some time in prison, was homeless for a period of time, and is a mother to a son whom she had no relationship or contact with for years, until Christy convinced him to reconnect with Marjorie following her cancer diagnosis. She was diagnosed with [[breast cancer]] in season 1, and after extensive treatment finally beats it at the end of season 2. Through Christy she meets Victor Perugian, Christy's former landlord, whom she eventually weds and then cares for after he suffers a stroke. When Victor dies, her vulnerable side is revealed, and the women do their best to help Marjorie cope with being widowed for the second time (her first husband having died before the start of the show, after three decades of marriage.)\n* [[Jaime Pressly]] as Jill Kendall (recurring, season 2; main, season 3\u2013present):<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2015/03/jaime-pressly-joins-mom-cast-new-regular-1201391977/|title=Jaime Pressly Named New 'Mom' Regular|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|work=Deadline|date=March 13, 2015|accessdate=March 13, 2015}}</ref> A wealthy [[socialite]] and alcoholic. Christy first met her at an AA meeting and decided to sponsor her. Jill suffered several relapses before becoming sober. Her mother had struggled with depression and alcoholism before committing suicide when Jill was a teenager. Jill carried this pain with her throughout her life, culminating in season 4, when she was overcome with grief on the anniversary of her mother's death. After trying to become pregnant and miscarrying, Jill decides to adopt a foster child. She is eventually given a teenage girl named Emily, but Christy helps her mother become sober at the start of season 5, leading to Emily leaving Jill. This caused Jill to overeat, leading her to gain weight (this was to cover up Pressly's pregnancy during the fifth season). After an extended stay at a health spa, she returns in the later half of season 5 and suffers another relapse. Despite being vain and obsessed with how her peers view her, she is shown to genuinely care about her friends and use her experiences to help them with their own problems. In season 6 she began a relationship with Andy, a police officer and former Marine who provided private home security services at Jill's home after it was broken into.\n* [[Beth Hall]] as Wendy Harris (recurring, season 2; main, season 3\u2013present):<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2015/05/29/mom-season-3-cast-changes-beth-hall-wendy/|title=Mom Season 3: Who's In?

She is a [[registered nurse]] (with a hidden sadistic streak that emerges when in uniform), was raised by a [[lesbian]] couple, and is a member of [[Mensa International|Mensa]]. The running joke in the series is that no one, including her friends, listens much to her or wants her around more than minimally possible. In \"A Pirate, Three Frogs, and a Prince\", Wendy was revealed to be both bisexual/pansexual/bicurious, and attracted to Bonnie.\n* [[William Fichtner]] as Adam Janikowski (recurring, season 3; main, season 4\u2013present):<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2016/06/24/mom-season-4-william-fichtner-series-regular-adam/|title=Mom Promotes William Fichtner to Series Regular for Season 4|last=Mason|first=Charlie|work=TV Line|date=June 24, 2016|accessdate=June 24, 2016}}</ref> Bonnie's latest love interest and later husband, a wheelchair-bound ex-[[stuntman]] whom she met over the phone after he dialed the wrong number. He is supportive of Bonnie's recovery, though does not always fully understand it. In season 6, he uses his life savings to open a bar called AJ's Barrelworks.\n* [[Kristen Johnston]] as Tammy Diffendorf (guest, season 5; recurring, season 6; main, season 7):<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvline.com/2019/07/18/mom-kristen-johnston-series-regular-tammy-season-7/|title='Mom': Kristen Johnston Promoted to Series Regular for Season 7|last=Gelman|first=Vlada|work=TV Line|date=July 18, 2019|accessdate=July 22, 2019}}</ref> an [[ex-con]] who was Bonnie's foster sister for a short time in their teens. They reconnect after Bonnie comes across Tammy while visiting a women's prison, and Tammy joins the group's AA meetings upon being released from prison in season 6. After temporarily living in Bonnie and Christy's apartment, she moves in with Marjorie. When she returns to her old foster home where she lived with Bonnie, it is revealed that her father killed her mother and she went into the system after that.\n\n===Recurring===\n* Reggie de Leon as Paul (seasons 1\u20133, 5\u20137): Chef Rudy's silent and often submissive [[sous-chef]].\n* [[Kevin Pollak]] as Alvin Lester Belitnikoff (seasons 1\u20132): Christy's father and Bonnie's ex-boyfriend who abandoned them when Christy was born. When Christy found Alvin he was married with two sons. Despite that, he loves Christy and does what he can to be in her life and help out, including fixing up a used car to give her and attempting to reach out to her children as a grandfather. He and Bonnie initially treated each other with contempt and hatred over the various mistakes each of them has made in their past, but they rekindled their relationship after his wife left him and he survived a heart attack. In season 2, Alvin suffers a second, fatal heart attack while in bed with Bonnie.\n* [[Octavia Spencer]] as Regina Tompkins (seasons 1\u20133): A fellow AA member and money manager who embezzled from her clients and faces a long prison sentence. While a close if questionable friend to Christy, Regina and Bonnie typically hold each other in contempt, but beneath the surface, they bear some affection for each other. In the middle of season 2, she is given early parole and becomes a born-again Christian, eventually moving in with Jill. Regina drifts apart from her friends after she decides she is no longer an alcoholic, essentially choosing wine over her friends, and struggles alone with the dissonance after moving into her own apartment and out of Jill's mansion.\n* [[Courtney Henggeler]] as Claudia (seasons 1\u20133): Gabriel's wealthy and snobbish (later ex-) wife, who takes over the restaurant from him and briefly appoints Christy as manager.\n* [[Mary Pat Gleason]] as Mary (seasons 1\u20135, 7): A fellow AA member who is frequently interrupted by Bonnie when she shares her problems with the group, as her anecdotes tend to be bizarre and creepy even by the standards of addicts. Mary dies in season 7 at the AA meeting from a brain aneurysm.\n* [[Don McManus]] as Steve Casper (seasons 1\u20134): A fellow AA member, Steve is a competent but creepy lawyer and occasionally aids Christy, who becomes his intern and trainee in season 2. He has a casual sex relationship with Bonnie in season 3. In season 4, he is shown to be in Mexico, hiding from trouble with a drug cartel.\n* [[Sara Rue]] as Candace Hayes (seasons 2\u20134): Baxter's wealthy new wife, who she reformed. She delivers many subtle jabs at Christy's poverty and seems to be trying to force Christy aside to replace her as Roscoe's mother. The hostility becomes much more obvious in season 3, when Candace's wealthy father, Fred ([[Harry Hamlin]]), briefly dates Christy and Candace accuses Christy of only being with him for his money. Christy breaks up with Fred because he openly insults and mocks Candace for doing nothing but living off his wealth. When Candace (wrongly and smugly) smirks that Fred dumped her, Christy gives Candace a hug and shuts her up by saying \"I know why you're such a bitch.\"\n* [[Jonny Coyne]] as Victor Perugian (seasons 2\u20134): Christy's Armenian former landlord who becomes attracted to Marjorie, marrying her in season 3. Victor later suffers two strokes (both offscreen). The first in Season 5 leaves him largely incapacitated, and the second in Season 6 is fatal.\n* [[Amy Hill]] as Beverly Tarantino (seasons 2\u20135): A tenant in the apartment building where Christy and Bonnie live.

Melendez and Shaun are able to save the man's leg and though he will have a long recovery, he is expected to be fine.

In the aftermath, Shaun helps Liam's parents see how their overbearing and overprotective nature towards their son lead to him getting sick in the first place.

Shaun finally confesses his love for Lea, who returns his feelings but refuses to be his girlfriend as she fears that dating her will be too much for Shaun to handle.\n |LineColor       = 17153C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 53\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 17\n |Title           = Fixation\n |DirectedBy      = Lisa Demaine\n |WrittenBy       = Jessica Grasl & Debbie Ezer\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|2}}\n |Viewers         = 5.66<ref name=\"3.17\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-monday-cable-originals-network-finals-3-2-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Monday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 3.2.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=March 3, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=March 3, 2020}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = Shaun, Melendez, and Claire treat Alice Gottfried, who has a rare condition that requires her [[adrenal gland]]s to be removed. With Alice refusing the treatment, Shaun invents a better surgery that is successful and which Melendez allows Shaun to perform himself. At the same time, Andrews, Morgan, and Park treat Wes Keeler, a survival instructor for at-risk youth who has developed a serious infection from a [[cactus]] prick, requiring a [[kidney transplant]]. One of his mentees, Max, proves to be a match, but Lim refuses as she feels Max isn't mature enough to make the decision despite Andrews, Morgan, and Park being on Max's side. At Wes' request, Lim lies to Max about the results, but Wes is left with little time to live unless they can find a suitable donor. Park's son Kellan visits, leaving Park worried at his panic attacks and withdrawn state. Claire's old friend Dash returns to visit and asks Claire on a date which she appears to accept on Melendez's advice. Lea once again rejects Shaun, but this time she specifies that it's because of his autism, which is something he can't \"fix\", leaving Shaun devastated.\n |LineColor       = 17153C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 54\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 18\n |Title           = Heartbreak\n |DirectedBy      = Steven DePaul\n |WrittenBy       = {{StoryTeleplay|s=David Renaud|t=Thomas L.

Finn has two simultaneous girlfriends; one learns of the other and vandalizes Finn's car. Finn's surgery is successful, and he advises Shaun to date other women. Shaun gets drunk and plans to vandalize Lea\u2019s car, but she catches him in the act. Unable to follow through with it, Shaun instead explodes at Lea about her treatment of him, as her negative feelings towards his autism was an unbearable betrayal for him. Park, Morgan, Lim, and Andrews treat a farmer who had both arms reattached after an accident, but has pain and limited strength. Lim resists Andrews's recommendation that they amputate, but they are ultimately forced to do so, instead giving him mechanical prosthetics. Morgan reveals her rheumatoid arthritis to Lim and states that the surgery will be her last, but changes her mind after witnessing the farmer's progress. Despite Glassman's disapproval, Morgan decides on a [[synovectomy]] to prolong her surgical career at the risk of permanent disability later in life. Claire admits to Melendez that she is reluctant to progress her relationship with Dash; when he later tells her she makes him a better person, she admits to her therapist that she is in love with Melendez.\n |LineColor       = 17153C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 55\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 19\n |Title           = Hurt\n |DirectedBy      = Mike Listo\n |WrittenBy       = Liz Friedman & Adam Scott Weissman\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|23}}\n |Viewers         = 6.81<ref name=\"3.19\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-monday-cable-originals-network-finals-3-23-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Monday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 3.23.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=March 24, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=March 24, 2020}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = {{Plot|episode|date=March 2020}} Melendez, Glassman, and Lea are attending a charity fundraiser at a brewery for Marta, one of Melendez\u2019s former patients. Marta\u2019s wife, Noreen, gives the three of them a tour of the brewery when a massive earthquake hits, trapping Lea in the basement and giving Melendez seemingly minor injuries. Lim organizes a team to assist at the brewery while Andrews oversees the E.R., which Morgan takes charge of while Andrews leads surgery with Glassman. Shaun immediately goes to look for Lea while Park and Lim treat Casey, a young man with injuries far worse than immediately detected. Park proposes a surgery with a 1% chance of being effective as opposed to a 100% chance of death if untreated, while Melendez and Claire are forced to perform a risky surgery on Marta or else she faces certain paralysis; thanks to an ingenious idea by Claire, they succeed. Meanwhile, Shaun finds Vera, who got impaled after coming to the event to win her ex-boyfriend back; they bond as Shaun admits he doesn\u2019t want to move on from Lea (who overhears the conversation via radio after being rescued from the rubble). An aftershock hits as Melendez and Claire get Marta to the hospital, leading to Melendez collapsing and Shaun being trapped in a now-flooding basement. At the hospital, Morgan finds a young woman who requires emergency surgery for an [[ectopic pregnancy]]; as all the surgeons are occupied, Morgan (still recovering from her synovectomy) prepares to perform the surgery herself with only a nurse for help.\n |LineColor       = 17153C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 56\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 20\n |Title           = I Love You\n |DirectedBy      = David Shore\n |WrittenBy       = {{StoryTeleplay|s=David Hoselton & Adam Scott Weissman|t=David Hoselton & David Shore|tfirst=y}}\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|30}}\n |Viewers         = 7.71<ref name=\"3.20\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-monday-cable-originals-network-finals-3-30-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Monday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 3.30.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=March 31, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=March 31, 2020}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = Lim and Park's surgery on Casey fails; Park remains with Casey who reveals that he blames himself for his mother's death and wants to make amends with his father for his perceived mistake. With Casey's father unable to make it in time, Park pretends to be him to give the young man peace before he dies; the experience causes Park to decide to move back to Phoenix to be closer to his family. Lim returns to the ER where Claire calls her in to help treat Melendez who has internal bleeding; while performing surgery to repair it, Claire and Lim discover damage to Melendez's bowel that can't be repaired. Melendez makes peace with Lim and he and Claire express their feelings for each other before Melendez dies; Lim and Claire comfort each other in the aftermath. Morgan succeeds in saving her patient, but Andrews warns that the damage she did to her hands in the process might have destroyed her surgical career forever. In danger of drowning with Vera, Shaun is forced to perform a leg amputation in just a few minutes while a helpless Lea listens over the radio. Shaun succeeds in saving Vera and starts a relationship with Lea who realizes how much she loves Shaun after nearly losing him.\n |LineColor       = 17153C\n}}\n}}\n\n==Ratings==\n===Season

Shaun finally confesses his love for Lea, who returns his feelings but refuses to be his girlfriend as she fears that dating her will be too much for Shaun to handle.\n |LineColor       = 17153C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 53\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 17\n |Title           = Fixation\n |DirectedBy      = Lisa Demaine\n |WrittenBy       = Jessica Grasl & Debbie Ezer\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|2}}\n |Viewers         = 5.66<ref name=\"3.17\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-monday-cable-originals-network-finals-3-2-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Monday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 3.2.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=March 3, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=March 3, 2020}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = Shaun, Melendez, and Claire treat Alice Gottfried, who has a rare condition that requires her [[adrenal gland]]s to be removed. With Alice refusing the treatment, Shaun invents a better surgery that is successful and which Melendez allows Shaun to perform himself. At the same time, Andrews, Morgan, and Park treat Wes Keeler, a survival instructor for at-risk youth who has developed a serious infection from a [[cactus]] prick, requiring a [[kidney transplant]]. One of his mentees, Max, proves to be a match, but Lim refuses as she feels Max isn't mature enough to make the decision despite Andrews, Morgan, and Park being on Max's side. At Wes' request, Lim lies to Max about the results, but Wes is left with little time to live unless they can find a suitable donor. Park's son Kellan visits, leaving Park worried at his panic attacks and withdrawn state. Claire's old friend Dash returns to visit and asks Claire on a date which she appears to accept on Melendez's advice. Lea once again rejects Shaun, but this time she specifies that it's because of his autism, which is something he can't \"fix\", leaving Shaun devastated.\n |LineColor       = 17153C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 54\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 18\n |Title           = Heartbreak\n |DirectedBy      = Steven DePaul\n |WrittenBy       = {{StoryTeleplay|s=David Renaud|t=Thomas L.

Finn has two simultaneous girlfriends; one learns of the other and vandalizes Finn's car. Finn's surgery is successful, and he advises Shaun to date other women. Shaun gets drunk and plans to vandalize Lea\u2019s car, but she catches him in the act. Unable to follow through with it, Shaun instead explodes at Lea about her treatment of him, as her negative feelings towards his autism was an unbearable betrayal for him. Park, Morgan, Lim, and Andrews treat a farmer who had both arms reattached after an accident, but has pain and limited strength. Lim resists Andrews's recommendation that they amputate, but they are ultimately forced to do so, instead giving him mechanical prosthetics. Morgan reveals her rheumatoid arthritis to Lim and states that the surgery will be her last, but changes her mind after witnessing the farmer's progress. Despite Glassman's disapproval, Morgan decides on a [[synovectomy]] to prolong her surgical career at the risk of permanent disability later in life. Claire admits to Melendez that she is reluctant to progress her relationship with Dash; when he later tells her she makes him a better person, she admits to her therapist that she is in love with Melendez.\n |LineColor       = 17153C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 55\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 19\n |Title           = Hurt\n |DirectedBy      = Mike Listo\n |WrittenBy       = Liz Friedman & Adam Scott Weissman\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|23}}\n |Viewers         = 6.81<ref name=\"3.19\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-monday-cable-originals-network-finals-3-23-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Monday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 3.23.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=March 24, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=March 24, 2020}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = {{Plot|episode|date=March 2020}} Melendez, Glassman, and Lea are attending a charity fundraiser at a brewery for Marta, one of Melendez\u2019s former patients. Marta\u2019s wife, Noreen, gives the three of them a tour of the brewery when a massive earthquake hits, trapping Lea in the basement and giving Melendez seemingly minor injuries. Lim organizes a team to assist at the brewery while Andrews oversees the E.R., which Morgan takes charge of while Andrews leads surgery with Glassman. Shaun immediately goes to look for Lea while Park and Lim treat Casey, a young man with injuries far worse than immediately detected. Park proposes a surgery with a 1% chance of being effective as opposed to a 100% chance of death if untreated, while Melendez and Claire are forced to perform a risky surgery on Marta or else she faces certain paralysis; thanks to an ingenious idea by Claire, they succeed. Meanwhile, Shaun finds Vera, who got impaled after coming to the event to win her ex-boyfriend back; they bond as Shaun admits he doesn\u2019t want to move on from Lea (who overhears the conversation via radio after being rescued from the rubble). An aftershock hits as Melendez and Claire get Marta to the hospital, leading to Melendez collapsing and Shaun being trapped in a now-flooding basement. At the hospital, Morgan finds a young woman who requires emergency surgery for an [[ectopic pregnancy]]; as all the surgeons are occupied, Morgan (still recovering from her synovectomy) prepares to perform the surgery herself with only a nurse for help.\n |LineColor       = 17153C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 56\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 20\n |Title           = I Love You\n |DirectedBy      = David Shore\n |WrittenBy       = {{StoryTeleplay|s=David Hoselton & Adam Scott Weissman|t=David Hoselton & David Shore|tfirst=y}}\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|30}}\n |Viewers         = 7.71<ref name=\"3.20\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-monday-cable-originals-network-finals-3-30-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Monday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 3.30.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=March 31, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=March 31, 2020}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = Lim and Park's surgery on Casey fails; Park remains with Casey who reveals that he blames himself for his mother's death and wants to make amends with his father for his perceived mistake. With Casey's father unable to make it in time, Park pretends to be him to give the young man peace before he dies; the experience causes Park to decide to move back to Phoenix to be closer to his family. Lim returns to the ER where Claire calls her in to help treat Melendez who has internal bleeding; while performing surgery to repair it, Claire and Lim discover damage to Melendez's bowel that can't be repaired. Melendez makes peace with Lim and he and Claire express their feelings for each other before Melendez dies; Lim and Claire comfort each other in the aftermath. Morgan succeeds in saving her patient, but Andrews warns that the damage she did to her hands in the process might have destroyed her surgical career forever. In danger of drowning with Vera, Shaun is forced to perform a leg amputation in just a few minutes while a helpless Lea listens over the radio. Shaun succeeds in saving Vera and starts a relationship with Lea who realizes how much she loves Shaun after nearly losing him.\n |LineColor       = 17153C\n}}\n}}\n\n==Ratings==\n===Season
