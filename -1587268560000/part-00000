The station's original slogan ''The Quality Station'' was taken seriously by management, who tried to produce programs which they often perceived as being superior to similar programs being produced by rival stations.\n\n3XY was the last commercial radio station to come on air in Melbourne until [[Classic Rock Radio|3MP]] began broadcasting in 1976, 41 years later.  By the time 3XY began broadcasting in 1935, most listeners had established their broadcasting patterns and they often continued to listen to 3XY's rivals, which is usually seen as the reason why 3XY was very low in the ratings for some decades.<ref name=\"auto2\">Australian Broadcasting Control Board, Annual Reports.

They also broadcast descriptions of Melbourne [[thoroughbred racing in Australia|thoroughbred horse races]] each Saturday, as well as transmitting some interstate races.

(In the 1930s, the [[Postmaster-General's Department]] issued 24-hour licences to one station in each capital city market except Melbourne. In Melbourne, since 1931, [[3AK]] had been broadcasting almost exclusively in the early-morning hours when other stations were off the air. However, on 1 February 1954, 3AK began broadcasting exclusively during hours of daylight, and concurrently [[KIIS 101.1|3DB]], [[RSN Racing & Sport|3UZ]] and 3XY were all given 24-hour licences, but both 3DB and 3UZ had ceased all-night broadcasting within six months.  Nevertheless, between 1962 and 1968, the [[Australian Broadcasting Control Board]] had granted 24-hour licences to all Melbourne commercial stations; 24-hour transmission on [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] stations was to follow within a few years.)<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\n====1967-1989====\nFrom 1 July 1967,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/aus.radio.broadcast/HE2ZFqEQKOw|title=Google Groups|website=groups.google.com}}</ref> under the direction of General Manager Bob Baeck<ref>{{cite web|url=http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/285438|title=Biographical cuttings on Bob Baeck, general manager 3XY radio station (Melbourne), containing one or more cuttings from newspapers or journals|first=Bob|last=Baeck|publisher=|via=National Library of Australia (new catalog)}}</ref> the station became Melbourne's dominant [[music radio]] station and remained so until the early 1980s, with a [[Top 40]] [[music radio]] format, which often topped the ratings. Its sister station during this era was Sydney's [[2SM]]. Of the many promotions conducted by the station, the most important during the 1970s/80s was ''Rocktober'' held annually during the month of October.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://radiotoday.com.au/the-vault-more-3xy/|title=The Vault: 3XY, and a horse - Radio Today|date=30 June 2012|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n3XY dropped all of its religious programming in the late 1960s under the direction of Program Manager Dick Heming.

He often broadcast whilst in pyjamas.<ref name=\"heraldsun.com.au\"/><ref name=\"auto5\"/> During the late 1970s [[Derryn Hinch]] presented a current affairs morning program.\n\nThe [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] continued to have a marked influence at 3XY. In the late 1970s and 80s, the manager of the station was Stanley Guilfoyle, husband of Liberal Senator [[Margaret Guilfoyle]].<ref name=\"auto5\"/> [[Magnus Cormack]], a former Liberal senator, served as chairman of the company after his retirement from politics in 1978. The company's articles of association provided that, upon the sale of the company, any proceeds should be \"given or transferred to some institution or institutions having objects similar to the objects of the company\". In 1986, the radio licence was sold to businessman Paul Dainty for $15 million. The proceeds were used to establish the Cormack Foundation, which became a major donor to the Victorian Liberals.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/deal-behind-the-treasure-chest-thats-tearing-the-liberals-apart/news-story/f36803d7e17bd3525e12e7dc55ea819c|title=Deal behind the treasure chest that\u2019s tearing the Liberals apart|newspaper=[[The Australian]]|author=Pamela Williams|date=24 July 2017|access-date=21 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n====1989-1991====\nAfter losing the ratings and financial battle with FM rivals [[EON FM|3EON]] and [[FOX FM (Melbourne)|3FOX]], the 3XY licence was bought in late 1989 by the parent company of [[93.9 Bay FM|BAY-FM]], a [[Geelong]] based station which was then just about to come on air.  When BAY-FM commenced broadcasting in December 1989, 3XY briefly simulcast the BAY-FM overnight programs, retaining its [[rock music]] format during the day. However, once new studios in [[Corio Bay]] were completed, Bay FM and 3XY began full-time simulcasting, 3XY breaking only for coverage of [[Australian Football League]] (AFL) games, which they were contracted to cover. After a period of 12 months, the then-[[Australian Broadcasting Authority]] demanded that the two stations begin separate programming. While the two stations remained in their Corio studios, Bay FM relaunched with an [[easy listening]] format, with 3XY retaining its soft rock format. In 1991, 3XY was sold to [[Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia)|AWA Limited]], owners of [[2CH]] Sydney and other stations, who almost immediately shut the station down and re-opened it seven months later as 3EE.\n\n3XY's transmitter was turned off at 1.00 pm on 23 September 1991. The final on-air program as 3XY was a one-hour pre-recorded special, commissioned by AWA and produced and presented by music historian [[Glenn A. Baker]]. It was a tribute showcasing the music of 1976 when 3XY was number one in the radio ratings. Roxanne Bennett was the last 'live' announcer on 3XY, finishing her shift at 12 noon that day with [[Spectrum (band)|Spectrum]]'s song ''[[I'll Be Gone (Spectrum song)|I'll Be Gone]]'' the final song played before the one hour pre-recorded special was aired. The last song to be ever aired on 3XY, was [[AC/DC]]'s ''[[It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)]]'', at the end of the pre-recorded special.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWvcdSv1-o4|title=3XY's FINAL MOMENTS - AUDIO|first=|last=RIEGS-TV|date=9 June 2008|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nAWA formally applied for a change of callsign from 3XY to '''3EE''' and a change of frequency from 1422&nbsp;kHz to 693&nbsp;kHz. Both requests were granted by the [[Australian Broadcasting Authority]]. Although it was a relaunch of the 3XY licence that had existed since 1935 and not the issuing of a new licence, AWA chose to promote the forthcoming 3EE as a \"completely new\" station.\n\n(A new licence for the 1422&nbsp;kHz frequency was purchased at auction in 1994 by the Greek Media Group.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/3XY-Greek-Radio-177176725666138/|title=Log In or Sign Up to View|website=www.facebook.com}}</ref> Initially the licence was for a specified period of three years, and was then to be subject to a five yearly auction cycle. This rule was removed, and the station was effectively permitted to continue on a permanent basis. The new station<ref>https://radioau.net/3xy-hellas/</ref> adopted the 3XY call-sign. It is a [[narrowcast]] [[Greek language]] commercial station, with no connection to the station of 1935\u201391.)\n\n===1992-1993: 3EE===\nThe \"new\" station 3EE began official transmission at 7.00am Friday 2 July 1992. Promoted as ''The Breeze'', the station had a mix of easy listening music, personality talk and Saturday AFL football. Some programs garnered a loyal following but overall the station failed to gain a commercially viable audience in its target demographic of people aged 40+. AWA had a three-year strategy to grow the 3EE audience, but in 1993 the company decided to exit the commercial broadcasting sector and concentrate on its core business of electronics design and manufacture. AWA sold 3EE to Wesgo Communications, owner of another Melbourne station, [[3MP]], based in [[Frankston, Victoria|Frankston]], an outer south-eastern suburb. A few months later in 1994, AWA sold 3EE's sister station in Sydney [[2CH]], bringing to an end AWA's 70 years in radio broadcasting.\n\n===1993-2017: Magic 693/1278===\n3MP and 3EE [[simulcast]] their programs until the ABA ordered that they cease the practice and recommence two separate formats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&sy=nstore&kw=3EE&pb=sag&pb=age&dt=enterRange&dr=1month&sd=01/01/1993&ed=30/06/1994&so=date&sf=text&sf=headline&rc=200&rm=200&sp=adv&clsPage=1&docID=news931126_0181_2953|title=Fairfax Syndication Photo Print Sales and Content Licensing|website=newsstore.fairfax.com.au}}</ref> As from December 1993, 3EE used the marketing name of ''Magic 693'', whilst retaining its official call-sign 3EE. It had a 1940s, 1950s and 1960s music format, while 3MP maintained its more mainstream [[easy listening]] format on 1377.\n\nMedia operator [[Southern Cross Broadcasting]], which also owned Melbourne radio stations [[3AK]] and [[3AW]], bought the 3MP and 3EE licences, and in accordance with media ownership laws which restrict any organisation from owning more than two radio stations in one region, they chose to keep 3AW and 3EE (''Magic 693''), while selling off the lower rating 3AK and 3MP licences.\n\nFrom 1 May 2006, Magic 693 became Magic 1278 after switching frequencies with 3AW.\n\nOn 13 April 2015, the station's entire on air line-up, and most of the programming and production team, was made redundant, as the result of the merger of [[Fairfax Media]]'s radio assets and the [[Macquarie Radio Network]]. Immediately, a new music format was introduced that focused on the classic hits of the 1960s and 1970s.<ref>{{cite news|title=Magic gone from Magic!

The last song to be played on Magic 1278 was ''[[Thank You for the Music]]'' by [[ABBA]].\n\n===2017-2018: Talking Lifestyle===\nOn Monday 27 February 2017, Macquarie Radio Network relaunched 3EE as '''Talking Lifestyle'''.

The station's original slogan ''The Quality Station'' was taken seriously by management, who tried to produce programs which they often perceived as being superior to similar programs being produced by rival stations.\n\n3XY was the last commercial radio station to come on air in Melbourne until [[Classic Rock Radio|3MP]] began broadcasting in 1976, 41 years later.  By the time 3XY began broadcasting in 1935, most listeners had established their broadcasting patterns and they often continued to listen to 3XY's rivals, which is usually seen as the reason why 3XY was very low in the ratings for some decades.<ref name=\"auto2\">Australian Broadcasting Control Board, Annual Reports.

In Melbourne, since 1931, [[3AK]] had been broadcasting almost exclusively in the early-morning hours when other stations were off the air. However, on 1 February 1954, 3AK began broadcasting exclusively during hours of daylight, and concurrently [[KIIS 101.1|3DB]], [[RSN Racing & Sport|3UZ]] and 3XY were all given 24-hour licences, but both 3DB and 3UZ had ceased all-night broadcasting within six months.

When BAY-FM commenced broadcasting in December 1989, 3XY briefly simulcast the BAY-FM overnight programs, retaining its [[rock music]] format during the day. However, once new studios in [[Corio Bay]] were completed, Bay FM and 3XY began full-time simulcasting, 3XY breaking only for coverage of [[Australian Football League]] (AFL) games, which they were contracted to cover. After a period of 12 months, the then-[[Australian Broadcasting Authority]] demanded that the two stations begin separate programming. While the two stations remained in their Corio studios, Bay FM relaunched with an [[easy listening]] format, with 3XY retaining its soft rock format. In 1991, 3XY was sold to [[Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia)|AWA Limited]], owners of [[2CH]] Sydney and other stations, who almost immediately shut the station down and re-opened it seven months later as 3EE.\n\n3XY's transmitter was turned off at 1.00 pm on 23 September 1991. The final on-air program as 3XY was a one-hour pre-recorded special, commissioned by AWA and produced and presented by music historian [[Glenn A. Baker]]. It was a tribute showcasing the music of 1976 when 3XY was number one in the radio ratings. Roxanne Bennett was the last 'live' announcer on 3XY, finishing her shift at 12 noon that day with [[Spectrum (band)|Spectrum]]'s song ''[[I'll Be Gone (Spectrum song)|I'll Be Gone]]'' the final song played before the one hour pre-recorded special was aired. The last song to be ever aired on 3XY, was [[AC/DC]]'s ''[[It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)]]'', at the end of the pre-recorded special.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWvcdSv1-o4|title=3XY's FINAL MOMENTS - AUDIO|first=|last=RIEGS-TV|date=9 June 2008|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nAWA formally applied for a change of callsign from 3XY to '''3EE''' and a change of frequency from 1422&nbsp;kHz to 693&nbsp;kHz. Both requests were granted by the [[Australian Broadcasting Authority]]. Although it was a relaunch of the 3XY licence that had existed since 1935 and not the issuing of a new licence, AWA chose to promote the forthcoming 3EE as a \"completely new\" station.\n\n(A new licence for the 1422&nbsp;kHz frequency was purchased at auction in 1994 by the Greek Media Group.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/3XY-Greek-Radio-177176725666138/|title=Log In or Sign Up to View|website=www.facebook.com}}</ref> Initially the licence was for a specified period of three years, and was then to be subject to a five yearly auction cycle. This rule was removed, and the station was effectively permitted to continue on a permanent basis. The new station<ref>https://radioau.net/3xy-hellas/</ref> adopted the 3XY call-sign. It is a [[narrowcast]] [[Greek language]] commercial station, with no connection to the station of 1935\u201391.)\n\n===1992-1993: 3EE===\nThe \"new\" station 3EE began official transmission at 7.00am Friday 2 July 1992. Promoted as ''The Breeze'', the station had a mix of easy listening music, personality talk and Saturday AFL football. Some programs garnered a loyal following but overall the station failed to gain a commercially viable audience in its target demographic of people aged 40+. AWA had a three-year strategy to grow the 3EE audience, but in 1993 the company decided to exit the commercial broadcasting sector and concentrate on its core business of electronics design and manufacture. AWA sold 3EE to Wesgo Communications, owner of another Melbourne station, [[3MP]], based in [[Frankston, Victoria|Frankston]], an outer south-eastern suburb. A few months later in 1994, AWA sold 3EE's sister station in Sydney [[2CH]], bringing to an end AWA's 70 years in radio broadcasting.\n\n===1993-2017: Magic 693/1278===\n3MP and 3EE [[simulcast]] their programs until the ABA ordered that they cease the practice and recommence two separate formats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&sy=nstore&kw=3EE&pb=sag&pb=age&dt=enterRange&dr=1month&sd=01/01/1993&ed=30/06/1994&so=date&sf=text&sf=headline&rc=200&rm=200&sp=adv&clsPage=1&docID=news931126_0181_2953|title=Fairfax Syndication Photo Print Sales and Content Licensing|website=newsstore.fairfax.com.au}}</ref> As from December 1993, 3EE used the marketing name of ''Magic 693'', whilst retaining its official call-sign 3EE. It had a 1940s, 1950s and 1960s music format, while 3MP maintained its more mainstream [[easy listening]] format on 1377.\n\nMedia operator [[Southern Cross Broadcasting]], which also owned Melbourne radio stations [[3AK]] and [[3AW]], bought the 3MP and 3EE licences, and in accordance with media ownership laws which restrict any organisation from owning more than two radio stations in one region, they chose to keep 3AW and 3EE (''Magic 693''), while selling off the lower rating 3AK and 3MP licences.\n\nFrom 1 May 2006, Magic 693 became Magic 1278 after switching frequencies with 3AW.\n\nOn 13 April 2015, the station's entire on air line-up, and most of the programming and production team, was made redundant, as the result of the merger of [[Fairfax Media]]'s radio assets and the [[Macquarie Radio Network]]. Immediately, a new music format was introduced that focused on the classic hits of the 1960s and 1970s.<ref>{{cite news|title=Magic gone from Magic!

Blaze and Roxy were the original candidates for the Red and Yellow Rangers until Evox corrupted the Morph-X and infected their bodies; cloning them into his loyal Avatars while the real ones are rendered comatose. Following this, Devon and Zoey took their place by accident. However, their Morph-X that were semi-corrupted by Evox causing them to receive varying weaknesses. The Rangers transform with using Beast-X Morphers in conjunction with Morph-X Keys and each wield a Beast-X Blaster and Saber, which can be combined to form the Beast-X Cannon. In season 2, Nate developed the Beast-X Visors, which allow Devon, Ravi, and Zoe to combine with their Beast Bot partners and assume Beast-X Mode to enhance their animal powers.\n\n===Devon Daniels===\n'''Devon Daniels''' is the leader of the Beast Morpher Rangers and the son of Mayor Adam Daniels.

Being a genius, Nate is a quick thinker in situations that require it; such as when he gave Devon, Ravi, and Zoey their powers to protect the Morphing Grid.\n\nWhen he was kidnapped by the Avatars and forced to build a robot body for Evox, Nate was able to subvert the plot by fusing himself with [[mantis]] DNA, which allows him to use martial arts, and become the Gold Ranger. Following this, he officially joined the other Rangers in the field.\n\nNate pilots the Wrecker Zord which has a [[mobile crane|crane truck]] mode, a mantis mode, and a humanoid warrior mode.\n\nNate Silva is portrayed by Abraham Rodriguez.<ref name=\"BeastMorphersCast\" />\n\n===Steel===\n'''Steel''' is a [[stag beetle]]/[[Scarabaeidae|scarab beetle]]-like android whom Nate built after he was captured by Cybervillain Blaze and Cybervillain Roxy and forced to build a robot body for the Evox from the parts that Scrozzle stole from the hangar that a deactivated Slicerdrone was briefly held in. When Nate subverted their plot, he inadvertently fused said robot body with scarab beetle DNA and his human DNA. As a result, \"Steel\" became the Silver Ranger as well as a \"brother\" of sorts to Nate.\n\nAs the Silver Beast Morpher Ranger, he was fused with scarab DNA, granting him superhuman stamina.\nSteel controls the Jet Zord which has a jet mode and a scarab beetle mode.\n\nSteel is performed by Reid McGowan and voiced by [[Jamie Linehan]].<!--REMOVE WHEN THEIR RESPECTFUL DEBUT HAPPENS\n\n===Legendary Rangers===\n* '''[[Jason Lee Scott]]''' - He is the Red Ranger from [[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thathashtagshow.com/2019/05/02/exclusive-austin-st-john-set-to-return-for-team-up-in-power-rangers-beast-morphers/|title=EXCLUSIVE: Austin St. John Set To Return For Team-Up In POWER RANGERS: Beast Morphers|last=Deckelmeier|first=Joe|date=2019-05-02|website=That Hashtag Show|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-04}}</ref>\n* '''[[Zack Taylor]]''' - He is the Black Ranger from Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.\n* '''[[Billy Cranston]]''' - He is the Blue Ranger from Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.\n* '''Aisha Campbell''' - She is the second Yellow Ranger from Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.\n* '''[[Kimberly Ann Hart]]''' - She is the Pink Ranger from Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.\n* '''Connor McKnight''' - He is the Red Dino Ranger from [[Power Rangers Dino Thunder]].\n* '''Ethan James''' - He is the Blue Dino Ranger from Power Rangers Dino Thunder.\n* '''Kira Ford''' - She is the Yellow Dino Ranger from Power Rangers Dino Thunder.\n* '''[[Tommy Oliver]]''' - He is the Black Dino Thunder Ranger from Power Rangers Dino Thunder.\n* '''Trent Fernandez-Mercer''' - He is the White Dino Thunder Ranger from Power Rangers Dino Thunder.\n* '''Tyler Navarro''' - He is the Red Dino Charge Ranger from [[Power Rangers Dino Charge]].<ref name=\"DinoCharge\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.powerrangersnow.com/power-rangers-dino-charge-beast-morphers-teamup/|title=Power Rangers Dino Charge Cast Returning For Beast Morphers|website=Power Rangers NOW|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-04}}</ref>\n* '''Chase Randall''' - He is the Black Dino Charge Ranger from Power Rangers Dino Charge.<ref name=\"DinoCharge\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.powerrangersnow.com/power-rangers-dino-charge-beast-morphers-teamup/|title=Power Rangers Dino Charge Cast Returning For Beast Morphers|website=Power Rangers NOW|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-04}}</ref>\n* '''Koda''' - A [[caveman]] who is the Blue Dino Charge Ranger from Power Rangers Dino Charge.<ref name=\"DinoCharge\" />\n* '''Riley Griffin''' - He is the Green Dino Charge Ranger from Power Rangers Dino Charge.\n* '''Shelby Watkins''' - She is the Pink Dino Charge Ranger from Power Rangers Dino Charge.\n* '''Sir Ivan of Zandar''' - A [[knight]] from medieval times is the Gold Dino Charge Ranger from Power Rangers Dino Charge.<ref name=\"DinoCharge\" />-->\n\n==Grid Battleforce==\n'''Grid Battleforce''' is a secret organization that was created to use Morph-X and to keep their enemies from gaining control of the Morphin Grid.\n\n===Commander Shaw===\n'''Commander Shaw''' is the head commander of Grid Battleforce and Ravi's mother.\n\nCommander Shaw is portrayed by [[Teuila Blakely]].\n\n===Beast Bots===\nThe Beasts Bots are the robotic partners of the Beast Morpher Rangers. Each one was developed based on their Rangers' animal motifs. When combined with the Rangers' Zords, the Beast Bots provide a Beast Mode while their heads take on the form of control devices. In season two, Nate developed the Beast-X Visor, which can digitize the Beast Bots and transform them into armor for their Ranger partners' Beast-X Modes.\n\n* '''Cruise''' (voiced by Kelson Henderson) - He is the cheetah-like partner of Devon who suffers from short-term memory loss.

While he acts sternly, he cares for his children and has childish moments.\n\nIn \"Beast King Rampage,\" General Burke headed up the development of the Beast-X King Zord to protect the global Morph-X Towers without Commander Shaw's knowledge and with Mayor Daniels' approval. Furthermore, he rehired Megan to assist in it's engineering.\n\nGeneral Burke is portrayed by [[Mark Wright (actor)|Mark Wright]].\n\n===Blaze===\n'''Blaze''' is a karate instructor at Riptide Gym and the original Red Ranger candidate. He develops a rivalry with Devon when they get into a karate match, during which Devon defeated him. While becoming the Red Ranger, Blaze gets put into a coma when Evox corrupts the process and creates an avatar based on him. When his avatar is destroyed, Blaze comes out of his coma and shows some respect to Devon; becoming fast friends.\n\nFollowing Evox's apparent death, Blaze continued his karate instructor job. He and Roxy were briefly trapped by Trappertron so that Scrozzle can scan them for their DNA. Following Trapperdrone's destruction, Blaze and Roxy learned that Scrozzle created robot clones of them.\n\nBlaze is portrayed by Colby Strong.\n\n===Roxy===\n'''Roxy''' is the original Yellow Ranger candidate and Ravi's girlfriend. Before the series took place, they were in a relationship until Ravi broke up with her to focus on their ranger duties. While becoming the Yellow Ranger, Roxy gets put into a coma when Evox corrupts the process and creates an Avatar based on her.\n\nWhen her avatar is destroyed, Roxy comes out of her coma. As she wakes up, she reveals that her mind was still connected to her evil counterpart. As such, she learned that Scrozzle was building a robot body for Evox so that he can teleport to Coral Harbor and destroy it. Roxy and Ravi got back together again afterwards.\n\nFollowing Evox's apparent destruction, Roxy goes to work for her Aunt Regina at Collins Industries. She and Blaze were briefly trapped by Trappertron so that Scrozzle can scan them. Following Trapperdrone's destruction, Roxy and Blaze learned that Scrozzle created robot clones of them.\n\nRoxy is portrayed by Liana Ramirez.\n\n===Megan===\n'''Megan''' is a Grid Battleforce technician who attempted to steal Nate's job through dishonest means, such as blackmailing Zoey to get close to him before sabotaging one of his experiments to make him look incompetent. After her deception was revealed, she was immediately fired.\n\nIn season two, Megan returned months later after joining General Burke's secret project to create the Beast-X King Zord to protect the global Morph-X towers; overseeing the designing and programming herself. After Evox's minions corrupted it with a virus, Megan reconciled with Nate and the Rangers before helping them regain control of the Zord. Following this, she is welcomed back to Grid Battleforce.\n\nMegan is portrayed by Madeleine Adams.\n\n==Supporting characters==\n===Adam Daniels===\n'''Adam Daniels''' is Devon's father and the strict but responsible [[Mayor]] of Coral Harbor who cares for his son. He was initially against the use of Morph-X as villains from other dimensions have attacked while targeting the Morphin Grid for its vast power, until he learned Grid Battleforce created the Beast Morpher Rangers to protect it and changed his mind. During the season one finale, he became possessed by Evox after braving the Cyber Dimension to save his son.\n\nAdam Daniels is portrayed by Kevin Copeland.\n\n===Muriel Reeves===\n'''Muriel Reeves''' is the mother of Zoey and a [[Journalist|reporter]] for News Channel 10.\n\nMuriel Reeves is portrayed by Sia Trokenheim.\n\n===Regina Collins===\n'''Regina Collins''' is Roxy's aunt and [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of Collins Industries.\n\nRegina Collins is portrayed by [[Miriama Smith]].\n\n==Villains==\n===Evox===\n'''Evox''' is a sentient [[computer virus]] that speaks through the avatar of a [[king cobra]] that he can project into the real world. Evox infiltrated Grid Battleforce's computer systems so he could take over the Morphin Grid. His actions caused the creations of evil [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]] clones of Blaze and Roxy, put the real ones into comas, and corrupted the Rangers' animal DNA. With help from Devon, Ravi, and Zoey, Nate was able to disconnect Evox from the system and teleported him and the Cybervillains to another dimension. The three of them landed in the Cyber Dimension, where they formed an alliance with Scrozzle, and later Vargoyle, in order to obtain enough Morph-X to send Evox back to Coral Harbor.\n\nAfter stealing a Morph-X Tower, Scrozzle begins to work on a robot body for Evox. Once he has it, Evox takes on the Rangers and overpowers them; destroying most of their Zords, though the Racer Zord survived. Believing the Rangers couldn't threaten him anymore, Evox starts to teleport back to the real world. However, Nate blocks him in the Cyber-Dimension and Devon's able to use the Racer Zord to destroy the stolen tower as well as Evox's body. Despite this, Evox survived by possessing Mayor Daniels, who came to the Cyber Dimension to rescue his son.\n\nEver since, Evox has secretly worked to collect Morph-X once more to continue his plans and maintain control over his host. As Scrozzle warns, he has to ensure he has enough or else he'll transform back to his true form unwillingly.\n\nEvox is voiced by Richard Ewing.\n\n===Cybervillain Blaze===\n'''Cybervillain Blaze''' is the Evil Crimson Ranger and an Avatar of the human Blaze. While Blaze was in the middle of becoming the Red Beast Morpher Ranger, Evox corrupted the process; placing him into a coma and creating an evil Avatar based on him to serve him. Cybervillain Blaze inherited his human template's rivalry with Devon after he was humiliated at the Riptide Gym.\n\nAfter a series of schemes and plots, he and Cybervillain Roxy succeeded in stealing a Morph-X Tower so Scrozzle could use it to build Evox a robot body and send him back to Coral Harbor. When the Rangers stormed the Cyber Dimension to destroy the tower, Blaze piloted a Megazord Scrozzle built to stop them; only to be defeated by Devon in the Racer Zord. As a result of the avatar's defeat, the real Blaze awakens from his coma.\n\nCybervillain Blaze is portrayed by Colby Strong.<ref name=\"SupportingCast\">{{cite web|url=https://www.powerrangersnow.com/new-power-rangers-beast-morphers-cast-announced/|title=New Power Rangers Beast Morphers Cast Announced|website=PowerRangersNow|author=Staff|date=September 19, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Cybervillain Roxy===\n'''Cybervillain Roxy''' is the Evil Yellow Ranger and an Avatar of the human Roxy. While Roxy was in the middle of becoming the Yellow Beast Morpher Ranger, Evox corrupted the process; placing her in a coma and creating an evil Avatar based on her to serve her. As Roxy's human counterpart was originally in a relationship with Ravi before he broke up with her to focus on his Ranger duties, the Avatar used this to her advantage to weaken Ravi's resolve on various occasions.\n\nWhen Evox concocts a plan to teleport a Morph-X Tower to the Cyber Dimension, Cybervillain Roxy engages the Blue Ranger so Cybervillain Blaze can steal three mega transporters required for the plan. After destroying her morpher, Ravi succeeds in destroying Cybervillain Roxy; allowing the real Roxy to awaken from her coma.\n\nCybervillain Roxy is portrayed by Liana Ramirez.<ref name=\"SupportingCast\"/>\n\n===Scrozzle===\n'''Scrozzle''' is a robot and the de facto ruler of the Cyber Dimension after he hid out there from Vargoyle. When Evox and the Cybervillains arrived in the Cyber Dimension, Scrozzle reluctantly formed an alliance with them; lending them his gadgetry skills, Tronics, Robotrons, and Gigadrones.\n\nHe uses his talents to create teleporters to travel between the Cyber Dimension and Coral Harbor, re-purpose Morph-X Keys for the Cybervillains to transform, create Robotrons via the Robotron-Maker, and create giant Gigadrones that feed on Morph-X. Scrozzle dislikes having to work with the Cybervillains as he views them as incompetent, though he did work with them once to betray Vargoyle.\n\nAfter the Cybervillains successfully stole a Morph-X Tower, Scrozzle began construction on Evox's new robot body before preparing to teleport him back to the real world. However, the Rangers stormed the Cyber Dimension and foiled the latter plot, though Scrozzle was able to escape with his Robotron-Maker.\n\nScrozzle later planned his revenge against the Rangers by attacking them on Christmas and turn them into ornaments. He nearly succeeded, but Steel and the Beast Bots were able to foil his plan by freeing the Rangers. In response, Scrozzle unleashed Infernodrone and piloted it directly. Scrozzle was seemingly destroyed when Cruise used the Racer Zord to destroy Infernodrone.\n\nIn season 2 however, Scrozzle survived his apparent destruction by ejecting from Infernodrone so he can continue serving Evox. In between seasons, they commandeered a crystalline dimension as their new base. To fill out their ranks, Scrozzle scanned Blaze and Roxy for their DNA so he could combine it with back-up data on the fallen Cybervillains and spare robot parts to create robot versions of them. To ensure they survive, he also programmed the machine that built them to recreate their bodies when they fall in battle.\n\nScrozzle is voiced by [[Campbell Cooley]].\n\n===Vargoyle===\nVargoyle is a [[Raygun|laser gun]]-themed robot who was built by Scrozzle. After using several Fury Cells on himself, he became more evil than his creator and turned on him; forcing Scrozzle to take refuge in the Cyber Dimension.\n\nVargoyle is not seen in the series until late into season one, when he finally catches up to Scrozzle to take the remaining Fury Cells. After defeating the Cybervillains, Evox recruits him into his ranks while offering a reward if he proved himself against the Rangers. Once he did, Vargoyle received an upgrade originally meant for the Avatars, who put aside their differences to get payback. Vargoyle continued to prove himself to Evox by easily defeating the Rangers in a second fight and building a weapon from a blueprint he stole from the Avatars for his master plan. After creating Shockatron and Shockadrone to distract the Rangers, Vargoyle used his Memory Pulsator to alter Coral Harbor's citizens' memories so the Avatars could steal three mega-transporters. Though the Rangers failed to stop the Avatars, Devon was able to destroy Vargoyle after he was betrayed by his allies.\n\nVargoyle is voiced by Jamie Linehan.\n\n===Robo-Blaze===\n'''Robo-Blaze''' is a robot clone created by Scrozzle from Cybervillain Blaze's back-up data, spare robot parts, and the real Blaze's DNA.

Outside of super-speed and shooting lasers from its arms, Cycledrone also possesses super-strength. It fought the Beast Racer Zord, the Beast Chopper Zord, and Beast Wheeler Zord before being destroyed by the Beast Racer Zord.\n* '''Needledrone''' - A Beta Model Gigadrone created from Needletron's data. It can fire explosive needles, possesses super-strength, and drain Morph-X. Needledrone tried to steal Morph-X from a Morph-X Tower, only to be stopped by the Beast Wheeler Zord. Needledrone was destroyed by the Beast Racer Zord.\n* '''Shoveldrone''' - A Beta Model Gigadrone armed with Shoveltron's arms and missiles. After getting Shoveltron's data from Scrozzle, Shoveldrone was dispatched to assist its Robotron counterpart in attacking Coral Harbor. While Zoey and Ravi fight Shoveltron, Devon used the Beast Racer Zord to fight Shoveldrone. After Shoveltron was destroyed, Shoveldrone was destroyed by the Beast Racer Zord.\n* '''Slicerdrone''' - A Gamma Model Gigadrone equipped with Slicertron's saw arm. In addition to its saw attacks, it can also project a shield, absorb Morph-X with its optics, and shoot bullets from its left arm. After getting Slicertron's data from Scrozzle, Slicerdrone was dispatched to help the Robotron fight the Rangers. The Beast Racer Zord shut down Slicerdrone, which was then transported to a secret hangar. In \"Hangar Heist,\" Nate conducted research on the deactivated Slicerdrone in order to develop a device capable of detecting incoming Gigadrones early. However, Cybervillain Roxy and Meltatron raid the hangar to reboot Slicerdrone to destroy the Rangers. When the Beast Racer Zord redirects Meltadrone's acid attack onto the hangar doors, Slicerdrone emerges and joins the battle. Both of them are destroyed by the Beast-X Megazord.\n* '''Meltadrone''' - A Beta Model Gigadrone armed with Meltatron's spray arm and chest. Like Meltatron, it can spray an acid mist. When Devon tried to use the Beast Racer Zord to free his fellow Rangers from the hangar holding Slicerdrone, Scrozzle used Meltatron's data to create Meltadrone and stop him. Despite melting the Zord's swords, Devon tricks the Meltadrone into melting the hangar doors open to free the other Rangers and Slicerdrone. Ravi and Zoey summon their Zords to form the Beast-X Megazord and destroy Meltadrone and Slicerdrone.\n* '''Raildrone''' - An Alpha Model Gigadrone created from Railtron's data capable of shooting a beam from his chest and combining with two Gigatronics to perform a powerful ramming attack. To assist Raildrone, Scrozzle also dispatched two Gigatronics. They temporarily overpowered the Beast-X Megazord until the Rangers shot Raildrone and the Gigatronics down and destroyed them.\n* '''Vacuudrone''' - A Gamma Model Gigadrone created from Vacuutron's data. Like its Robotron counterpart, it is armed with a vacuum arm capable of draining Morph-X powered machinery. Scrozzle created Vacuudrone to drain Morph-X towers before it was destroyed by the Beast-X Megazord.\n* '''Antennadrone''' - An Alpha Model Gigadrone created from Antennatron's data to destroy the Rangers. While it wields an antenna staff like its Robotron counterpart, it can fire missiles that release Gigatronics to aid it. Devon engaged Antennadrone in his Racer Zord, but was overpowered until Nate and Steel arrived in the Wrecker Zord and Jet Zord respectively to aid him. After Nate and Steel defeated the Gigatronics, Devon was able to destroy Antennadrone.\n* '''Drilldrone''' - An Alpha Model Gigadrone armed with Drilltron's drill arms. It can dig underground at super-speed and fire lasers. While Cybervillain Roxy and Drilltron were burrowing from below a Morph-X Tower, the former ordered Scrozzle to create Drilldrone and send it to an entirely different tower as part of a diversion. Overhearing this, Ravi tells Devon and Zoey to intercept it. Taking the Racer and Chopper Zords, Devon and Zoey were ambushed by Drilldrone, which blasted them from below. After Ravi destroyed Drilltron, he was able to join his allies in the Wheeler Zord and help them form the Beast-X Megazord to destroy Drilldrone.\n* '''Tooldrone''' - A Gamma Model Gigadrone created from Tooltron's data armed with its Robotron counterpart's wrenches and lasers. Tooldrone was dispatched to attack the Rangers. It nearly disabled the Wrecker Zord before Steel arrived in the Jet Zord. Tooldrone was destroyed by the Beast-X Megazord and the Striker Megazord.\n** '''Tooldrone's Delta Model Gigadrone''' - Tooldrone carried this Gigadrone in its back to assist it, only to be destroyed by the Beast-X Megazord and the Striker Megazord.\n* '''Clonedrone''' - An Alpha Model Gigadrone created from Clonetron's data. Like its Robotron counterpart, it can disguise itself and fire lasers from its chest. After Clonetron blasted the Zord computer, Scrozzle created Clonedrone to take advantage of the Zord-less Rangers. Nate and Steel were able to fix the computer enough to get the Beast Racer Zord deployed so it could confront the Gigadrone. When Ravi and Zoey joined the fight, Clonedrone assumed the Beast Racer Zord's appearance in an attempt to confuse them. After a moment's hesitation, Zoey blasted both of them, revealing Clonedrone before the Rangers formed the Beast-X Megazord to destroy it.\n* '''Tubadrone''' - A Beta Model Gigadrone created from Tubatron capable of firing sonic blasts. Scrozzle dispatched this Gigadrone to attack a Morph-X Tower while the Rangers were busy with Tubatron. Once they defeated the Robotron, they intercepted the Gigadrone with a recording of Tubatron's soundwaves to counter its attacks. Devon used the Racer Zord to destroy Tubadrone's horns before the Rangers destroyed it with the Beast-X Megazord.\n* '''Spikedrone''' - A Beta Model Gigadrone created from Spiketron's data armed with its Robotron counterpart's trident hand as well as missiles. While the Rangers were fighting Spiketron, Scrozzle created Spikedrone to attack Coral Harbor. Though Devon and Zoey were able to eventually intercept it, their attacks couldn't faze it. When it unleashed a Delta Model Gigadrone, Ravi entered the battle and helped the other Rangers form the Beast-X Megazord. Due to being low on Morph-X however, the Gigadrones blasted it apart. In response, Nate and Steel intervened in their zords, weakening Spikedrone enough for Ravi to use his Zord's gorilla mode to destroy it.\n** '''Spikedrone's Delta Model Gigadrone''' - Spikedrone carried this Gigadrone within its body to assist it and overpowered the Beast-X Megazord before it was destroyed by the Wrecker and Jet Zords.\n* '''Tubadrone 2.0''' - An Alpha Model Gigadrone created from Tubatron 2.0 capable of firing sonic blasts. After Tubatron 2.0 was destroyed, though not before damaging the Rangers' gear, Scrozzle created Tubadrone 2.0 to take advantage of this. Despite this, Devon was able to use his Racer Zord to destroy Tubadrone 2.0.\n* '''Burnerdrone''' - An Alpha Model Gigadrone armed with a flamethrower for a right hand and wields a candlewick-like blade in battle. After Burnertron was destroyed, Scrozzle created Burnerdrone to melt a Morph-X Tower. When Devon intercepted it, Burnerdrone summoned a pair of Gigatronics to assist it. After Devon destroyed them, Nate and Steel arrived in the Striker Megazord and destroyed Burnerdrone before putting out the fire on the Morph-X Tower.\n* '''Turbodrone''' - A Beta Model Gigadrone created from Turbotron's data equipped with arm blades and Turbotron's chest fan and wings, though it also has electrical optic beams. After Turbotron was destroyed, Scrozzle created Turbodrone to draw the Rangers away from Vargoyle. From the sky, Turbotron used its lightning attacks to keep Devon away while it attacked a Morph-X Tower. As Turbodrone was too high for Devon to reach, he used the Wheeler Zord's gorilla mode as a springboard to get up to the Gigadrone and destroy it.\n* '''Shockadrone''' - A Beta Model Gigadrone created from Shockatron's data that can absorb energy and wields two cotton candy sticks for redirecting energy attacks. While the Rangers were fighting Shockatron, Scrozzle used its data to create Shockadrone and send it as a distraction so that Vargoyle could put the Memory Pulsator in place for a future plot. Nate, Steel, and Devon fought Shockadrone with their respective zords; eventually wearing it down before destroying it.\n* '''Unidentified Gigadrone 1''' - A Gamma Model Gigadrone with an arm cannon that was dispatched following Vargoyle's destruction. It was quickly destroyed by the Beast-X Megazord.\n* '''Unidentified Gigadrone 2''' - A \"bobblehead\" Beta Model Gigadrone sent to distract the Rangers while Cybervillain Blaze secured the three mega transporters Evox needed for his latest plot. It was destroyed by the combined efforts of the Racer Zord and the Striker Megazord.\n* '''Infernodrone''' - An Alpha Model Gigadrone with a chest-mounted flamethrower. Following Infernotron's destruction, Scrozzle used its data to create Infernodrone and piloted it directly. As the Rangers were trapped at the time, the Beast Bots had to control the zords by themselves while Steel worked to free the Rangers. Despite releasing two Gigatronics to aid it, Cruise was able to destroy them before destroying Infernodrone itself, though Scrozzle ejected at the last minute.\n* '''Drilldrone 2.0''' - An Alpha Model Gigadrone with the same abilities as the previous version along with shoulder-mounted drills. It was teleported underground to assist Scrozzle in stealing subterranean stores of Morph-X and deployed four Gigatronics as backup before it was destroyed by the Wrecker Zord.\n* '''Trapperdrone''' - A Beta Model Gigadrone that can shoot lasers from its wrist-mounted blasters. When Trappertron was destroyed, Scrozzle created Trapperdrone to destroy the Rangers. It targeted a Morph-X Tower, but was easily destroyed by the Beast-X Ultrazord's Beast-X Ultra Strike.\n* '''Gamerdrone''' - A Beta Model Gigadrone that can shoot blaster bolts from its projector head and form a dome around itself to drain Morph-X from anything within it. When Gamertron was destroyed, her data was used to create Gamerdrone. As the Beast-X Ultrazord was losing Morph-X inside Gamerdrone's dome, the Rangers destroyed it quickly with the Beast-X Ultra Strike.\n* '''Keydrone''' - An Alpha Model Gigadrone with similar abilities as its Robotron counterpart while also wielding Gamerdrone's dome projector. After Keytron failed to weaken Grid Battleforce's defenses and was destroyed, Scrozzle created Keydrone to destroy it. Despite temporarily disabling the Rangers' Ultrazord, the Rangers were able to destroy Keydrone with the Beast-X Ultra Strike.\n* '''Digidrone''' - An Alpha Model Gigadrone. After Digitron was destroyed, Scrozzle saved his data before using it to create Digidrone alongside Controladrone to assist it in battle before it was destroyed by the Striker Megazord.\n* '''Controladrone''' - A Gamma Model Gigadrone that possesses similar abilities as its Robotron counterpart. Controladrone was created using Controlatron's data and deployed by Scrozzle alongside Digidrone to steal Morph-X and fight the Rangers. During the battle, it took control of the Wheeler Zord until Zoey destroyed its puppet. While Digidrone was destroyed by the Striker Megazord, Controladrone was destroyed by the Beast-X Megazord.\n* '''Alphadrone''' - An Alpha Model Gigadrone created by Boxertron with a trident arm. It fought and was destroyed by the Racer Zord.\n* '''Betadrone''' - A Beta Model Gigadrone created by Boxertron that wields a dumbbell-esque [[club (weapon)|war club]]. It was destroyed by Gammadrone after Devon tricked the latter into attacking the former.\n* '''Gammadrone''' - A Gamma Model Gigadrone created by Boxertron with a [[kickboxing]] inspired fighting style. It was destroyed by the Beast-X King Ultrazord.\n* '''Deltadrone''' - A Delta Model Gigadrone created by Boxertron with a [[boxing]] inspired fighting style. It was destroyed by the Beast-X King Ultrazord.<!--REMOVE WHEN THEIR RESPECTFUL DEBUT HAPPENS\n* '''Dumbbelldrone''' - A Beta Model Gigadrone that wields a large dumbbell.-->\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* [http://www.powerrangers.com Official Power Rangers Website]\n\n{{Power Rangers characters}}\n\n[[Category:Power Rangers]]\n[[Category:Lists of Power Rangers characters|Beast Morphers]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{Overly detailed|date=August 2019}}\n{{Fanpov|date=August 2019}}\n}}\n'''''[[Power Rangers Beast Morphers]]''''' is an American children's television series that airs on [[Nickelodeon]].

Blaze and Roxy were the original candidates for the Red and Yellow Rangers until Evox corrupted the Morph-X and infected their bodies; cloning them into his loyal Avatars while the real ones are rendered comatose. Following this, Devon and Zoey took their place by accident. However, their Morph-X that were semi-corrupted by Evox causing them to receive varying weaknesses. The Rangers transform with using Beast-X Morphers in conjunction with Morph-X Keys and each wield a Beast-X Blaster and Saber, which can be combined to form the Beast-X Cannon. In season 2, Nate developed the Beast-X Visors, which allow Devon, Ravi, and Zoe to combine with their Beast Bot partners and assume Beast-X Mode to enhance their animal powers.\n\n===Devon Daniels===\n'''Devon Daniels''' is the leader of the Beast Morpher Rangers and the son of Mayor Adam Daniels.

He developed Morph-X for use as a clean, sustainable energy source and created the Beast Morpher Rangers' powers and arsenal. Being a genius, Nate is a quick thinker in situations that require it; such as when he gave Devon, Ravi, and Zoey their powers to protect the Morphing Grid.\n\nWhen he was kidnapped by the Avatars and forced to build a robot body for Evox, Nate was able to subvert the plot by fusing himself with [[mantis]] DNA, which allows him to use martial arts, and become the Gold Ranger. Following this, he officially joined the other Rangers in the field.\n\nNate pilots the Wrecker Zord which has a [[mobile crane|crane truck]] mode, a mantis mode, and a humanoid warrior mode.\n\nNate Silva is portrayed by Abraham Rodriguez.<ref name=\"BeastMorphersCast\" />\n\n===Steel===\n'''Steel''' is a [[stag beetle]]/[[Scarabaeidae|scarab beetle]]-like android whom Nate built after he was captured by Cybervillain Blaze and Cybervillain Roxy and forced to build a robot body for the Evox from the parts that Scrozzle stole from the hangar that a deactivated Slicerdrone was briefly held in. When Nate subverted their plot, he inadvertently fused said robot body with scarab beetle DNA and his human DNA. As a result, \"Steel\" became the Silver Ranger as well as a \"brother\" of sorts to Nate.\n\nAs the Silver Beast Morpher Ranger, he was fused with scarab DNA, granting him superhuman stamina.\nSteel controls the Jet Zord which has a jet mode and a scarab beetle mode.\n\nSteel is performed by Reid McGowan and voiced by [[Jamie Linehan]].<!--REMOVE WHEN THEIR RESPECTFUL DEBUT HAPPENS\n\n===Legendary Rangers===\n* '''[[Jason Lee Scott]]''' - He is the Red Ranger from [[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thathashtagshow.com/2019/05/02/exclusive-austin-st-john-set-to-return-for-team-up-in-power-rangers-beast-morphers/|title=EXCLUSIVE: Austin St. John Set To Return For Team-Up In POWER RANGERS: Beast Morphers|last=Deckelmeier|first=Joe|date=2019-05-02|website=That Hashtag Show|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-04}}</ref>\n* '''[[Zack Taylor]]''' - He is the Black Ranger from Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.\n* '''[[Billy Cranston]]''' - He is the Blue Ranger from Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.\n* '''Aisha Campbell''' - She is the second Yellow Ranger from Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.\n* '''[[Kimberly Ann Hart]]''' - She is the Pink Ranger from Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.\n* '''Connor McKnight''' - He is the Red Dino Ranger from [[Power Rangers Dino Thunder]].\n* '''Ethan James''' - He is the Blue Dino Ranger from Power Rangers Dino Thunder.\n* '''Kira Ford''' - She is the Yellow Dino Ranger from Power Rangers Dino Thunder.\n* '''[[Tommy Oliver]]''' - He is the Black Dino Thunder Ranger from Power Rangers Dino Thunder.\n* '''Trent Fernandez-Mercer''' - He is the White Dino Thunder Ranger from Power Rangers Dino Thunder.\n* '''Tyler Navarro''' - He is the Red Dino Charge Ranger from [[Power Rangers Dino Charge]].<ref name=\"DinoCharge\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.powerrangersnow.com/power-rangers-dino-charge-beast-morphers-teamup/|title=Power Rangers Dino Charge Cast Returning For Beast Morphers|website=Power Rangers NOW|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-04}}</ref>\n* '''Chase Randall''' - He is the Black Dino Charge Ranger from Power Rangers Dino Charge.<ref name=\"DinoCharge\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.powerrangersnow.com/power-rangers-dino-charge-beast-morphers-teamup/|title=Power Rangers Dino Charge Cast Returning For Beast Morphers|website=Power Rangers NOW|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-04}}</ref>\n* '''Koda''' - A [[caveman]] who is the Blue Dino Charge Ranger from Power Rangers Dino Charge.<ref name=\"DinoCharge\" />\n* '''Riley Griffin''' - He is the Green Dino Charge Ranger from Power Rangers Dino Charge.\n* '''Shelby Watkins''' - She is the Pink Dino Charge Ranger from Power Rangers Dino Charge.\n* '''Sir Ivan of Zandar''' - A [[knight]] from medieval times is the Gold Dino Charge Ranger from Power Rangers Dino Charge.<ref name=\"DinoCharge\" />-->\n\n==Grid Battleforce==\n'''Grid Battleforce''' is a secret organization that was created to use Morph-X and to keep their enemies from gaining control of the Morphin Grid.\n\n===Commander Shaw===\n'''Commander Shaw''' is the head commander of Grid Battleforce and Ravi's mother.\n\nCommander Shaw is portrayed by [[Teuila Blakely]].\n\n===Beast Bots===\nThe Beasts Bots are the robotic partners of the Beast Morpher Rangers.

As she wakes up, she reveals that her mind was still connected to her evil counterpart. As such, she learned that Scrozzle was building a robot body for Evox so that he can teleport to Coral Harbor and destroy it. Roxy and Ravi got back together again afterwards.\n\nFollowing Evox's apparent destruction, Roxy goes to work for her Aunt Regina at Collins Industries. She and Blaze were briefly trapped by Trappertron so that Scrozzle can scan them. Following Trapperdrone's destruction, Roxy and Blaze learned that Scrozzle created robot clones of them.\n\nRoxy is portrayed by Liana Ramirez.\n\n===Megan===\n'''Megan''' is a Grid Battleforce technician who attempted to steal Nate's job through dishonest means, such as blackmailing Zoey to get close to him before sabotaging one of his experiments to make him look incompetent. After her deception was revealed, she was immediately fired.\n\nIn season two, Megan returned months later after joining General Burke's secret project to create the Beast-X King Zord to protect the global Morph-X towers; overseeing the designing and programming herself. After Evox's minions corrupted it with a virus, Megan reconciled with Nate and the Rangers before helping them regain control of the Zord. Following this, she is welcomed back to Grid Battleforce.\n\nMegan is portrayed by Madeleine Adams.\n\n==Supporting characters==\n===Adam Daniels===\n'''Adam Daniels''' is Devon's father and the strict but responsible [[Mayor]] of Coral Harbor who cares for his son. He was initially against the use of Morph-X as villains from other dimensions have attacked while targeting the Morphin Grid for its vast power, until he learned Grid Battleforce created the Beast Morpher Rangers to protect it and changed his mind. During the season one finale, he became possessed by Evox after braving the Cyber Dimension to save his son.\n\nAdam Daniels is portrayed by Kevin Copeland.\n\n===Muriel Reeves===\n'''Muriel Reeves''' is the mother of Zoey and a [[Journalist|reporter]] for News Channel 10.\n\nMuriel Reeves is portrayed by Sia Trokenheim.\n\n===Regina Collins===\n'''Regina Collins''' is Roxy's aunt and [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of Collins Industries.\n\nRegina Collins is portrayed by [[Miriama Smith]].\n\n==Villains==\n===Evox===\n'''Evox''' is a sentient [[computer virus]] that speaks through the avatar of a [[king cobra]] that he can project into the real world. Evox infiltrated Grid Battleforce's computer systems so he could take over the Morphin Grid. His actions caused the creations of evil [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]] clones of Blaze and Roxy, put the real ones into comas, and corrupted the Rangers' animal DNA. With help from Devon, Ravi, and Zoey, Nate was able to disconnect Evox from the system and teleported him and the Cybervillains to another dimension. The three of them landed in the Cyber Dimension, where they formed an alliance with Scrozzle, and later Vargoyle, in order to obtain enough Morph-X to send Evox back to Coral Harbor.\n\nAfter stealing a Morph-X Tower, Scrozzle begins to work on a robot body for Evox. Once he has it, Evox takes on the Rangers and overpowers them; destroying most of their Zords, though the Racer Zord survived. Believing the Rangers couldn't threaten him anymore, Evox starts to teleport back to the real world. However, Nate blocks him in the Cyber-Dimension and Devon's able to use the Racer Zord to destroy the stolen tower as well as Evox's body. Despite this, Evox survived by possessing Mayor Daniels, who came to the Cyber Dimension to rescue his son.\n\nEver since, Evox has secretly worked to collect Morph-X once more to continue his plans and maintain control over his host. As Scrozzle warns, he has to ensure he has enough or else he'll transform back to his true form unwillingly.\n\nEvox is voiced by Richard Ewing.\n\n===Cybervillain Blaze===\n'''Cybervillain Blaze''' is the Evil Crimson Ranger and an Avatar of the human Blaze.

When the Rangers stormed the Cyber Dimension to destroy the tower, Blaze piloted a Megazord Scrozzle built to stop them; only to be defeated by Devon in the Racer Zord. As a result of the avatar's defeat, the real Blaze awakens from his coma.\n\nCybervillain Blaze is portrayed by Colby Strong.<ref name=\"SupportingCast\">{{cite web|url=https://www.powerrangersnow.com/new-power-rangers-beast-morphers-cast-announced/|title=New Power Rangers Beast Morphers Cast Announced|website=PowerRangersNow|author=Staff|date=September 19, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Cybervillain Roxy===\n'''Cybervillain Roxy''' is the Evil Yellow Ranger and an Avatar of the human Roxy. While Roxy was in the middle of becoming the Yellow Beast Morpher Ranger, Evox corrupted the process; placing her in a coma and creating an evil Avatar based on her to serve her. As Roxy's human counterpart was originally in a relationship with Ravi before he broke up with her to focus on his Ranger duties, the Avatar used this to her advantage to weaken Ravi's resolve on various occasions.\n\nWhen Evox concocts a plan to teleport a Morph-X Tower to the Cyber Dimension, Cybervillain Roxy engages the Blue Ranger so Cybervillain Blaze can steal three mega transporters required for the plan. After destroying her morpher, Ravi succeeds in destroying Cybervillain Roxy; allowing the real Roxy to awaken from her coma.\n\nCybervillain Roxy is portrayed by Liana Ramirez.<ref name=\"SupportingCast\"/>\n\n===Scrozzle===\n'''Scrozzle''' is a robot and the de facto ruler of the Cyber Dimension after he hid out there from Vargoyle. When Evox and the Cybervillains arrived in the Cyber Dimension, Scrozzle reluctantly formed an alliance with them; lending them his gadgetry skills, Tronics, Robotrons, and Gigadrones.\n\nHe uses his talents to create teleporters to travel between the Cyber Dimension and Coral Harbor, re-purpose Morph-X Keys for the Cybervillains to transform, create Robotrons via the Robotron-Maker, and create giant Gigadrones that feed on Morph-X. Scrozzle dislikes having to work with the Cybervillains as he views them as incompetent, though he did work with them once to betray Vargoyle.\n\nAfter the Cybervillains successfully stole a Morph-X Tower, Scrozzle began construction on Evox's new robot body before preparing to teleport him back to the real world. However, the Rangers stormed the Cyber Dimension and foiled the latter plot, though Scrozzle was able to escape with his Robotron-Maker.\n\nScrozzle later planned his revenge against the Rangers by attacking them on Christmas and turn them into ornaments. He nearly succeeded, but Steel and the Beast Bots were able to foil his plan by freeing the Rangers. In response, Scrozzle unleashed Infernodrone and piloted it directly. Scrozzle was seemingly destroyed when Cruise used the Racer Zord to destroy Infernodrone.\n\nIn season 2 however, Scrozzle survived his apparent destruction by ejecting from Infernodrone so he can continue serving Evox. In between seasons, they commandeered a crystalline dimension as their new base. To fill out their ranks, Scrozzle scanned Blaze and Roxy for their DNA so he could combine it with back-up data on the fallen Cybervillains and spare robot parts to create robot versions of them. To ensure they survive, he also programmed the machine that built them to recreate their bodies when they fall in battle.\n\nScrozzle is voiced by [[Campbell Cooley]].\n\n===Vargoyle===\nVargoyle is a [[Raygun|laser gun]]-themed robot who was built by Scrozzle. After using several Fury Cells on himself, he became more evil than his creator and turned on him; forcing Scrozzle to take refuge in the Cyber Dimension.\n\nVargoyle is not seen in the series until late into season one, when he finally catches up to Scrozzle to take the remaining Fury Cells. After defeating the Cybervillains, Evox recruits him into his ranks while offering a reward if he proved himself against the Rangers. Once he did, Vargoyle received an upgrade originally meant for the Avatars, who put aside their differences to get payback. Vargoyle continued to prove himself to Evox by easily defeating the Rangers in a second fight and building a weapon from a blueprint he stole from the Avatars for his master plan. After creating Shockatron and Shockadrone to distract the Rangers, Vargoyle used his Memory Pulsator to alter Coral Harbor's citizens' memories so the Avatars could steal three mega-transporters. Though the Rangers failed to stop the Avatars, Devon was able to destroy Vargoyle after he was betrayed by his allies.\n\nVargoyle is voiced by Jamie Linehan.\n\n===Robo-Blaze===\n'''Robo-Blaze''' is a robot clone created by Scrozzle from Cybervillain Blaze's back-up data, spare robot parts, and the real Blaze's DNA. He can assume an amber-colored robot form while in battle as well as pilot rebuilt versions of his Cybervillain counterpart's Megazord. If he and Robo-Roxy are destroyed, they can be recreated in the machine that created them.\n\nRobo-Blaze is portrayed by Colby Strong.\n\n===Robo-Roxy===\n'''Robo-Roxy''' is a robot clone created by Scrozzle from Cybervillain Roxy's back-up data, spare robot parts, and the real Roxy's DNA. She can assume a violet-colored robot form while in battle. If she and Robo-Blaze are destroyed, they can be recreated in the machine that created them.\n\nRobo-Roxy is portrayed by Liana Ramirez.\n\n===Tronics===\nThe '''Tronics''' are robotic foot soldiers armed with hand-mounted blasters that can double as melee weapons. They were created by Scrozzle to protect him from Vargoyle and are used by Evox as his foot soldiers.\n\n===Gigatronics===\nThe '''Gigatronics''' are gigantic foot soldiers often used to fight the Zords and assist the Alpha Model Gigadrones.<!--REMOVE WHEN THEIR RESPECTFUL DEBUT HAPPENS\n\n===Returning villains===\n* '''\"Neo-[[Goldar]]\"''' - A [[manticore]]-themed monster with a strong resemblance to Goldar from ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers]]''.\n* '''[[Putty Patrol]]''' - Rita Repulsa's [[Golem]] foot soldiers from ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers''.\n* '''Triptoids''' - Mesogog's [[amoeba]]-themed foot soldiers from ''[[Power Rangers Dino Thunder]]''.\n* '''Snide''' - An evil [[Ammonoidea|ammonite]]-themed personality of Heckyl's from ''[[Power Rangers Dino Charge]]''.\n* '''Vivix''' - Sledge's [[paramecium]]-themed foot soldiers from ''Power Rangers Dino Charge''.-->\n\n===Robotrons===\nThe '''Robotrons''' are robotic monsters that are created when a Robotron Creation Key infects an item it connects to with a virus developed from Evox.\n\n* '''Cycletron''' (voiced by [[Barry Duffield]]) - A [[bicycle]]-themed Robotron created when Scrozzle infected some car [[tire]]s.

He can morph and mimic any human he scans with his scanner, fire a beam from said scanner, and fire a yellow laser from his eye. Clonetron was tasked with scanning Nate and infiltrating Grid Battleforce in order to sabotage their Zord interface computers. As soon as Clonetron got to it however, Steel caught on to him. When the other Rangers got involved, the Robotron tried disguising himself as Steel to confuse them, only for this to fail. Exposed, Clonetron blasted the Zord interface computer and fled the base. Ravi and Zoey eventually caught up to him and destroyed him with their Beast-X Blasters.\n* '''Tubatron''' (voiced by Joseph Wycoff) - A [[tuba]]-themed Robotron created by Cybervillain Roxy when she infected a discarded tuba in order to obtain data on Devon's animal power. He can fire sonic blasts and possesses super-strength. When Tubatron proved ineffective in battle, Roxy had Scrozzle upgrade his horn so that his sonic blasts can knock victims unconscious. Though Tubatron succeeded in his mission, when he was destroyed by the Rangers, his data disc was destroyed along with him.\n* '''Spiketron''' (voiced by Felix Becroft) - A [[fork]]-themed Robotron with a trident-like right hand who was created off-screen. He has super-strength and can use his trident hand in battle. Spiketron accompanied Scrozzle in robbing a truck containing Morph-X. When the Rangers arrived, Scrozzle escaped while Spiketron fought them before Nate and Steel destroyed him.\n* '''Tubatron 2.0''' (voiced by Joseph Wycoff) - A stronger counterpart of Tubatron who was created by Cybervillain Blaze. Like the original model, Tubatron 2.0 has super-strength. Unlike the original, this Tubatron's sonic blasts can disable the Rangers' equipment and gear. After stealing Scrozzle's Fury Cells, and at Evox's suggestion, Blaze used one to power up Tubatron 2.0 and ordered him to attack the Rangers; significantly overpowering them. While Nate and Steel managed to steal some of the other Fury Cells from Tubatron 2.0, Blaze escaped with two.

When a Robotron is destroyed, Scrozzle will use their data to convert a Gigadrone and send it to the human dimension.\n\nCurrently, there are four models of Gigadrones:\n\n* The speed-oriented Alpha Model capable of carrying Gigatronics.\n* The brute force-oriented Beta Model.\n* The well-rounded Gamma Model.\n* The parasitic Delta Model capable of being stored within other Gigadrones.\n\n* '''Cycledrone''' - An Alpha Model Gigadrone created from Cycletron's data. Outside of super-speed and shooting lasers from its arms, Cycledrone also possesses super-strength. It fought the Beast Racer Zord, the Beast Chopper Zord, and Beast Wheeler Zord before being destroyed by the Beast Racer Zord.\n* '''Needledrone''' - A Beta Model Gigadrone created from Needletron's data. It can fire explosive needles, possesses super-strength, and drain Morph-X. Needledrone tried to steal Morph-X from a Morph-X Tower, only to be stopped by the Beast Wheeler Zord. Needledrone was destroyed by the Beast Racer Zord.\n* '''Shoveldrone''' - A Beta Model Gigadrone armed with Shoveltron's arms and missiles. After getting Shoveltron's data from Scrozzle, Shoveldrone was dispatched to assist its Robotron counterpart in attacking Coral Harbor. While Zoey and Ravi fight Shoveltron, Devon used the Beast Racer Zord to fight Shoveldrone. After Shoveltron was destroyed, Shoveldrone was destroyed by the Beast Racer Zord.\n* '''Slicerdrone''' - A Gamma Model Gigadrone equipped with Slicertron's saw arm. In addition to its saw attacks, it can also project a shield, absorb Morph-X with its optics, and shoot bullets from its left arm. After getting Slicertron's data from Scrozzle, Slicerdrone was dispatched to help the Robotron fight the Rangers. The Beast Racer Zord shut down Slicerdrone, which was then transported to a secret hangar. In \"Hangar Heist,\" Nate conducted research on the deactivated Slicerdrone in order to develop a device capable of detecting incoming Gigadrones early. However, Cybervillain Roxy and Meltatron raid the hangar to reboot Slicerdrone to destroy the Rangers. When the Beast Racer Zord redirects Meltadrone's acid attack onto the hangar doors, Slicerdrone emerges and joins the battle. Both of them are destroyed by the Beast-X Megazord.\n* '''Meltadrone''' - A Beta Model Gigadrone armed with Meltatron's spray arm and chest. Like Meltatron, it can spray an acid mist. When Devon tried to use the Beast Racer Zord to free his fellow Rangers from the hangar holding Slicerdrone, Scrozzle used Meltatron's data to create Meltadrone and stop him. Despite melting the Zord's swords, Devon tricks the Meltadrone into melting the hangar doors open to free the other Rangers and Slicerdrone. Ravi and Zoey summon their Zords to form the Beast-X Megazord and destroy Meltadrone and Slicerdrone.\n* '''Raildrone''' - An Alpha Model Gigadrone created from Railtron's data capable of shooting a beam from his chest and combining with two Gigatronics to perform a powerful ramming attack.

After Nate and Steel defeated the Gigatronics, Devon was able to destroy Antennadrone.\n* '''Drilldrone''' - An Alpha Model Gigadrone armed with Drilltron's drill arms. It can dig underground at super-speed and fire lasers. While Cybervillain Roxy and Drilltron were burrowing from below a Morph-X Tower, the former ordered Scrozzle to create Drilldrone and send it to an entirely different tower as part of a diversion. Overhearing this, Ravi tells Devon and Zoey to intercept it. Taking the Racer and Chopper Zords, Devon and Zoey were ambushed by Drilldrone, which blasted them from below. After Ravi destroyed Drilltron, he was able to join his allies in the Wheeler Zord and help them form the Beast-X Megazord to destroy Drilldrone.\n* '''Tooldrone''' - A Gamma Model Gigadrone created from Tooltron's data armed with its Robotron counterpart's wrenches and lasers. Tooldrone was dispatched to attack the Rangers. It nearly disabled the Wrecker Zord before Steel arrived in the Jet Zord. Tooldrone was destroyed by the Beast-X Megazord and the Striker Megazord.\n** '''Tooldrone's Delta Model Gigadrone''' - Tooldrone carried this Gigadrone in its back to assist it, only to be destroyed by the Beast-X Megazord and the Striker Megazord.\n* '''Clonedrone''' - An Alpha Model Gigadrone created from Clonetron's data. Like its Robotron counterpart, it can disguise itself and fire lasers from its chest. After Clonetron blasted the Zord computer, Scrozzle created Clonedrone to take advantage of the Zord-less Rangers. Nate and Steel were able to fix the computer enough to get the Beast Racer Zord deployed so it could confront the Gigadrone. When Ravi and Zoey joined the fight, Clonedrone assumed the Beast Racer Zord's appearance in an attempt to confuse them. After a moment's hesitation, Zoey blasted both of them, revealing Clonedrone before the Rangers formed the Beast-X Megazord to destroy it.\n* '''Tubadrone''' - A Beta Model Gigadrone created from Tubatron capable of firing sonic blasts. Scrozzle dispatched this Gigadrone to attack a Morph-X Tower while the Rangers were busy with Tubatron. Once they defeated the Robotron, they intercepted the Gigadrone with a recording of Tubatron's soundwaves to counter its attacks. Devon used the Racer Zord to destroy Tubadrone's horns before the Rangers destroyed it with the Beast-X Megazord.\n* '''Spikedrone''' - A Beta Model Gigadrone created from Spiketron's data armed with its Robotron counterpart's trident hand as well as missiles. While the Rangers were fighting Spiketron, Scrozzle created Spikedrone to attack Coral Harbor. Though Devon and Zoey were able to eventually intercept it, their attacks couldn't faze it. When it unleashed a Delta Model Gigadrone, Ravi entered the battle and helped the other Rangers form the Beast-X Megazord. Due to being low on Morph-X however, the Gigadrones blasted it apart. In response, Nate and Steel intervened in their zords, weakening Spikedrone enough for Ravi to use his Zord's gorilla mode to destroy it.\n** '''Spikedrone's Delta Model Gigadrone''' - Spikedrone carried this Gigadrone within its body to assist it and overpowered the Beast-X Megazord before it was destroyed by the Wrecker and Jet Zords.\n* '''Tubadrone 2.0''' - An Alpha Model Gigadrone created from Tubatron 2.0 capable of firing sonic blasts.

Despite this, Devon was able to use his Racer Zord to destroy Tubadrone 2.0.\n* '''Burnerdrone''' - An Alpha Model Gigadrone armed with a flamethrower for a right hand and wields a candlewick-like blade in battle. After Burnertron was destroyed, Scrozzle created Burnerdrone to melt a Morph-X Tower. When Devon intercepted it, Burnerdrone summoned a pair of Gigatronics to assist it. After Devon destroyed them, Nate and Steel arrived in the Striker Megazord and destroyed Burnerdrone before putting out the fire on the Morph-X Tower.\n* '''Turbodrone''' - A Beta Model Gigadrone created from Turbotron's data equipped with arm blades and Turbotron's chest fan and wings, though it also has electrical optic beams. After Turbotron was destroyed, Scrozzle created Turbodrone to draw the Rangers away from Vargoyle. From the sky, Turbotron used its lightning attacks to keep Devon away while it attacked a Morph-X Tower. As Turbodrone was too high for Devon to reach, he used the Wheeler Zord's gorilla mode as a springboard to get up to the Gigadrone and destroy it.\n* '''Shockadrone''' - A Beta Model Gigadrone created from Shockatron's data that can absorb energy and wields two cotton candy sticks for redirecting energy attacks. While the Rangers were fighting Shockatron, Scrozzle used its data to create Shockadrone and send it as a distraction so that Vargoyle could put the Memory Pulsator in place for a future plot. Nate, Steel, and Devon fought Shockadrone with their respective zords; eventually wearing it down before destroying it.\n* '''Unidentified Gigadrone 1''' - A Gamma Model Gigadrone with an arm cannon that was dispatched following Vargoyle's destruction. It was quickly destroyed by the Beast-X Megazord.\n* '''Unidentified Gigadrone 2''' - A \"bobblehead\" Beta Model Gigadrone sent to distract the Rangers while Cybervillain Blaze secured the three mega transporters Evox needed for his latest plot. It was destroyed by the combined efforts of the Racer Zord and the Striker Megazord.\n* '''Infernodrone''' - An Alpha Model Gigadrone with a chest-mounted flamethrower. Following Infernotron's destruction, Scrozzle used its data to create Infernodrone and piloted it directly. As the Rangers were trapped at the time, the Beast Bots had to control the zords by themselves while Steel worked to free the Rangers. Despite releasing two Gigatronics to aid it, Cruise was able to destroy them before destroying Infernodrone itself, though Scrozzle ejected at the last minute.\n* '''Drilldrone 2.0''' - An Alpha Model Gigadrone with the same abilities as the previous version along with shoulder-mounted drills. It was teleported underground to assist Scrozzle in stealing subterranean stores of Morph-X and deployed four Gigatronics as backup before it was destroyed by the Wrecker Zord.\n* '''Trapperdrone''' - A Beta Model Gigadrone that can shoot lasers from its wrist-mounted blasters. When Trappertron was destroyed, Scrozzle created Trapperdrone to destroy the Rangers. It targeted a Morph-X Tower, but was easily destroyed by the Beast-X Ultrazord's Beast-X Ultra Strike.\n* '''Gamerdrone''' - A Beta Model Gigadrone that can shoot blaster bolts from its projector head and form a dome around itself to drain Morph-X from anything within it. When Gamertron was destroyed, her data was used to create Gamerdrone. As the Beast-X Ultrazord was losing Morph-X inside Gamerdrone's dome, the Rangers destroyed it quickly with the Beast-X Ultra Strike.\n* '''Keydrone''' - An Alpha Model Gigadrone with similar abilities as its Robotron counterpart while also wielding Gamerdrone's dome projector. After Keytron failed to weaken Grid Battleforce's defenses and was destroyed, Scrozzle created Keydrone to destroy it. Despite temporarily disabling the Rangers' Ultrazord, the Rangers were able to destroy Keydrone with the Beast-X Ultra Strike.\n* '''Digidrone''' - An Alpha Model Gigadrone. After Digitron was destroyed, Scrozzle saved his data before using it to create Digidrone alongside Controladrone to assist it in battle before it was destroyed by the Striker Megazord.\n* '''Controladrone''' - A Gamma Model Gigadrone that possesses similar abilities as its Robotron counterpart. Controladrone was created using Controlatron's data and deployed by Scrozzle alongside Digidrone to steal Morph-X and fight the Rangers.

It is commonly known as the '''Tasmanian tiger''' because of its striped lower back, or the '''Tasmanian wolf''' because of its [[canid]]-like characteristics. It was native to Tasmania, [[New Guinea]], and the [[Australia (continent)|Australian mainland]].\n\nThe thylacine was relatively shy and nocturnal, with the general appearance of a medium-to-large-size dog, except for its stiff tail and [[Pouch (marsupial)|abdominal pouch]] similar to a kangaroo's, and dark transverse stripes that radiated from the top of its back, reminiscent of a tiger. The thylacine was a formidable [[apex predator]],<ref name=\"Paddle\">[[#Paddle|Paddle (2000)]]</ref> though exactly how large its prey animals were is disputed. Because of [[convergent evolution]] it displayed a form and [[adaptations]] similar to the [[tiger]] and [[wolf]] of the Northern Hemisphere, even though not related. Its closest living relative is either the [[Tasmanian devil]] or the [[numbat]]. The thylacine was one of only two marsupials to have a pouch in both sexes: the other is the [[water opossum]]. The pouch of the male thylacine served as a protective sheath covering the [[Marsupial reproductive system|external reproductive organs]].\n\nThe thylacine had become extinct on the Australian mainland before [[History of Australia before 1901|British settlement]] of the continent, but it survived on the island of Tasmania along with several other [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species, including the [[Tasmanian devil]]. Intensive hunting encouraged by [[bounty (reward)|bounties]] is generally blamed for its extinction, but other contributing factors may have been disease, the introduction of dogs, and human encroachment into its habitat.\n\n==Taxonomic and evolutionary history==\n[[File:Didelphis cynocephala and Didelphis ursina, 1808.jpg|thumb|Tasmanian devil and thylacine, both labelled as members of ''Didelphis'', from Harris' 1808 description.

A few observations were made of the animal in captivity, but only limited, anecdotal evidence exists of the animal's behaviour in the wild. Most observations were made during the day whereas the thylacine was naturally nocturnal. Those observations, made in the twentieth century, may have been atypical as they were of a species already under the stresses that would soon lead to its extinction. Some behavioural characteristics have been extrapolated from the behaviour of its close relative, the Tasmanian devil.\n\nThe thylacine was a [[Nocturnal animal|nocturnal]] and [[crepuscular]] hunter, spending the daylight hours in small caves or hollow tree trunks in a nest of twigs, bark or fern fronds. It tended to retreat to the hills and forest for shelter during the day and hunted in the open heath at night. Early observers noted that the animal was typically shy and secretive, with awareness of the presence of humans and generally avoiding contact, though it occasionally showed inquisitive traits.<ref name=\"sight\">{{Cite journal | last = Heberle | first = G. | year = 1977 | journal = [[The Sunday Telegraph (Sydney)|Sunday Telegraph]] | page = 46 | title = Reports of alleged thylacine sightings in Western Australia | url = http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~gregheberle/AdobePDF/Thylacine/ThylacinePaper2004-P1-5.pdf | format = w | access-date = 5 February 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130521142704/http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~gregheberle/AdobePDF/Thylacine/ThylacinePaper2004-P1-5.pdf | archive-date = 21 May 2013 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref> At the time, much stigma existed in regard to its \"fierce\" nature; this is likely to be due to its perceived threat to agriculture.<ref>[http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/largest-private-collection-of-tasmanian-tigers-on-display.htm/ Tasmanian tigers brought to life] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110312203711/http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/largest-private-collection-of-tasmanian-tigers-on-display.htm |date=12 March 2011 }}, Australian Geographic, 24 February 2011.</ref>\n\n===Breeding===\nThere is evidence for at least some year-round breeding (cull records show joeys discovered in the pouch at all times of the year), although the peak breeding season was in winter and spring.<ref name=\"ABRS\" /> They would produce up to four joeys per litter (typically two or three), carrying the young in a pouch for up to three months and protecting them until they were at least half adult size.

A 2011 study by the [[University of New South Wales]] using advanced computer modelling indicated that the thylacine had surprisingly feeble jaws. Animals usually take prey close to their own body size, but an adult thylacine of around {{convert|30|kg|lb}} was found to be incapable of handling prey much larger than {{convert|5|kg|lb}}. Thus, some researchers believe thylacines only ate small animals such as [[bandicoot]]s and possums, putting them into direct competition with the [[Tasmanian devil]] and the [[tiger quoll]]. However, an earlier study showed that the thylacine had a bite force quotient of 166, similar to that of most quolls; in modern mammalian predators, such a high bite force is almost always associated with predators which routinely take prey as large, or larger than, themselves.<ref>{{Cite journal |pmc = 1564077|year = 2005|last1 = Wroe|first1 = S.|title = Bite club: Comparative bite force in big biting mammals and the prediction of predatory behaviour in fossil taxa|journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume = 272|issue = 1563|pages = 619\u2013625|last2 = McHenry|first2 = C.|last3 = Thomason|first3 = J.|pmid = 15817436|doi = 10.1098/rspb.2004.2986}}</ref> If the thylacine was indeed specialised for small prey, this specialisation likely made it susceptible to small disturbances to the ecosystem.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7998.2011.00844.x| title = Skull mechanics and implications for feeding behaviour in a large marsupial carnivore guild: The thylacine, Tasmanian devil and spotted-tailed quoll| journal = Journal of Zoology| volume = 285| issue = 4| pages = 292| year = 2011| last1 = Attard | first1 = M.

It is commonly known as the '''Tasmanian tiger''' because of its striped lower back, or the '''Tasmanian wolf''' because of its [[canid]]-like characteristics. It was native to Tasmania, [[New Guinea]], and the [[Australia (continent)|Australian mainland]].\n\nThe thylacine was relatively shy and nocturnal, with the general appearance of a medium-to-large-size dog, except for its stiff tail and [[Pouch (marsupial)|abdominal pouch]] similar to a kangaroo's, and dark transverse stripes that radiated from the top of its back, reminiscent of a tiger. The thylacine was a formidable [[apex predator]],<ref name=\"Paddle\">[[#Paddle|Paddle (2000)]]</ref> though exactly how large its prey animals were is disputed. Because of [[convergent evolution]] it displayed a form and [[adaptations]] similar to the [[tiger]] and [[wolf]] of the Northern Hemisphere, even though not related. Its closest living relative is either the [[Tasmanian devil]] or the [[numbat]]. The thylacine was one of only two marsupials to have a pouch in both sexes: the other is the [[water opossum]]. The pouch of the male thylacine served as a protective sheath covering the [[Marsupial reproductive system|external reproductive organs]].\n\nThe thylacine had become extinct on the Australian mainland before [[History of Australia before 1901|British settlement]] of the continent, but it survived on the island of Tasmania along with several other [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species, including the [[Tasmanian devil]]. Intensive hunting encouraged by [[bounty (reward)|bounties]] is generally blamed for its extinction, but other contributing factors may have been disease, the introduction of dogs, and human encroachment into its habitat.\n\n==Taxonomic and evolutionary history==\n[[File:Didelphis cynocephala and Didelphis ursina, 1808.jpg|thumb|Tasmanian devil and thylacine, both labelled as members of ''Didelphis'', from Harris' 1808 description.

A few observations were made of the animal in captivity, but only limited, anecdotal evidence exists of the animal's behaviour in the wild. Most observations were made during the day whereas the thylacine was naturally nocturnal. Those observations, made in the twentieth century, may have been atypical as they were of a species already under the stresses that would soon lead to its extinction. Some behavioural characteristics have been extrapolated from the behaviour of its close relative, the Tasmanian devil.\n\nThe thylacine was a [[Nocturnal animal|nocturnal]] and [[crepuscular]] hunter, spending the daylight hours in small caves or hollow tree trunks in a nest of twigs, bark or fern fronds. It tended to retreat to the hills and forest for shelter during the day and hunted in the open heath at night.

A 2011 study by the [[University of New South Wales]] using advanced computer modelling indicated that the thylacine had surprisingly feeble jaws. Animals usually take prey close to their own body size, but an adult thylacine of around {{convert|30|kg|lb}} was found to be incapable of handling prey much larger than {{convert|5|kg|lb}}. Thus, some researchers believe thylacines only ate small animals such as [[bandicoot]]s and possums, putting them into direct competition with the [[Tasmanian devil]] and the [[tiger quoll]]. However, an earlier study showed that the thylacine had a bite force quotient of 166, similar to that of most quolls; in modern mammalian predators, such a high bite force is almost always associated with predators which routinely take prey as large, or larger than, themselves.<ref>{{Cite journal |pmc = 1564077|year = 2005|last1 = Wroe|first1 = S.|title = Bite club: Comparative bite force in big biting mammals and the prediction of predatory behaviour in fossil taxa|journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume = 272|issue = 1563|pages = 619\u2013625|last2 = McHenry|first2 = C.|last3 = Thomason|first3 = J.|pmid = 15817436|doi = 10.1098/rspb.2004.2986}}</ref> If the thylacine was indeed specialised for small prey, this specialisation likely made it susceptible to small disturbances to the ecosystem.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7998.2011.00844.x| title = Skull mechanics and implications for feeding behaviour in a large marsupial carnivore guild: The thylacine, Tasmanian devil and spotted-tailed quoll| journal = Journal of Zoology| volume = 285| issue = 4| pages = 292| year = 2011| last1 = Attard | first1 = M.

The law has a particularly simple mathematical form if the temperature is measured on an absolute scale, such as in [[kelvin]]s. The law can then be expressed mathematically as\n\n:<math>{P}\\propto{T} \\quad or \\quad P=k T,</math>\nor\n:<math>\\frac{P}{T} = k,</math>\n\nwhere:\n\n:''P'' is the [[pressure]] of the gas,\n:''T'' is the [[temperature]] of the gas (measured in [[kelvin]]s),\n:''k'' is a [[Constant (mathematics)|constant]].\n\nThis law holds true because temperature is a measure of the average [[kinetic energy]] of a substance; as the kinetic energy of a gas increases, its particles collide with the container walls more rapidly, thereby exerting increased pressure.\n\nFor comparing the same substance under two different sets of conditions, the law can be written as:\n\n:<math>\\frac{P_1}{T_1} = \\frac{P_2}{T_2} \\qquad \\text{or} \\qquad P_1 T_2 = P_2 T_1.</math>\n\nBecause Amontons discovered the law beforehand, Gay-Lussac's name is now generally associated within chemistry with the law of combining volumes discussed in the section above.

Based on Gay-Lussac's results, [[Amedeo Avogadro]] hypothesized that, at the same temperature and pressure, equal volumes of gas contain equal numbers of molecules ([[Avogadro's law]]).

The law has a particularly simple mathematical form if the temperature is measured on an absolute scale, such as in [[kelvin]]s. The law can then be expressed mathematically as\n\n:<math>{P}\\propto{T} \\quad or \\quad P=k T,</math>\nor\n:<math>\\frac{P}{T} = k,</math>\n\nwhere:\n\n:''P'' is the [[pressure]] of the gas,\n:''T'' is the [[temperature]] of the gas (measured in [[kelvin]]s),\n:''k'' is a [[Constant (mathematics)|constant]].\n\nThis law holds true because temperature is a measure of the average [[kinetic energy]] of a substance; as the kinetic energy of a gas increases, its particles collide with the container walls more rapidly, thereby exerting increased pressure.\n\nFor comparing the same substance under two different sets of conditions, the law can be written as:\n\n:<math>\\frac{P_1}{T_1} = \\frac{P_2}{T_2} \\qquad \\text{or} \\qquad P_1 T_2 = P_2 T_1.</math>\n\nBecause Amontons discovered the law beforehand, Gay-Lussac's name is now generally associated within chemistry with the law of combining volumes discussed in the section above.

These three gas laws in combination with [[Avogadro's law]] can be generalized by the [[ideal gas law]].\n\n==Expansion of gases==\nGay-Lussac used the formula acquired from \u0394V/V = \u03b1\u0394T to define the rate of expansion \u03b1 for gases.
