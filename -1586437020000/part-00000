It worked so well that Stigwood gave him ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' (1978).

The film was nominated for five [[Golden Globe Awards]] and won two [[People's Choice Awards]], for Best Picture and Best Musical Picture. That year he even appeared in a role on the final season of the [[Angie Dickinson]] television series ''[[Police Woman (TV series)|Police Woman]]''. Stigwood and Carr would work on several other films, including 1978 [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winner ''[[The Deer Hunter]]''.\n\nThe following year, 1979, he produced the [[Village People]] film musical ''[[Can't Stop the Music|Can't Stop The Music]],''<ref name=Y/> a production which, while campy, steered clear of addressing the band members' presumed homosexuality in the script.

{"title_page": "Employment and Support Allowance", "text_new": "'''Employment and Support Allowance''' ('''ESA''') is a United Kingdom welfare payment for adults younger than the State Pension age who are having difficulty finding work because of their long-term medical condition or a disability. It is a basic income-replacement benefit paid in lieu of wages. It is currently being phased out and replaced with [[Universal Credit]].\n\n==Eligibility for ESA==\nAn individual can put in a claim for ESA if they satisfy all of these conditions:<ref name=\"GovESAEligibility\">{{cite web |title=Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) |url=https://www.gov.uk/employment-support-allowance/eligibility |website=GOV.UK |publisher=Government Digital Service |accessdate=2 January 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n* They live in the United Kingdom\n* They are over the age of sixteen\n* They have not reached their State Pension age\n* They have a sick-note from their doctor\n\nThey will not be paid ESA if they are entitled to [[Statutory sick pay|Statutory Sick Pay]] (which is paid out by a current employer) and it is not possible to receive ESA at the same time as the other main out-of-work benefits, i.e. [[Jobseekers Allowance]] or [[Income Support]]. \n\n[[Universal Credit]], which is received by one million people nationally, can contain a component analogous to ESA.\n\n==The scale of the allowance==\nNo money is paid for the first week. After that, the basic allowance is paid to the claimant until their [[Work Capability Assessment]] (WCA) at - in theory - week 13, after which a successful claimant might receive an enhanced level of payment (depending on the level of disability and whether they enter the work-related activity group or the support group after their assessment).<ref name=\"ESARates\">{{cite web|title=ESA: what you'll get|publisher=gov.uk|url=https://www.gov.uk/employment-support-allowance/what-youll-get|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202223227/https://www.gov.uk/employment-support-allowance/what-youll-get|archivedate=2016-02-02}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''<u><big>ESA Rates for 2019/2020</big></u>'''\n|\n|\n|-\n| ||paid in weeks 2\u201313 <br>\n| paid from week 14\n\n|-\n|Basic allowance (for those aged under 25)\n|\u00a357.90 Per week ||\u00a357.90 Per week\n|-\n|Basic allowance (for those aged 25 and over)\n|\u00a373.10 Per week||\u00a373.10 Per week\n|-\n|Work-related activity component (no longer paid to new claimants)* \n| \u2014\u2014\u2014 ||\u00a329.05 Per week\n|-\n|Support component*\n| \u2014\u2014\u2014 || \u00a338.55 Per week\n|}\n\n<nowiki>* Only one of these components is payable per claim\n</nowiki>\n\nIn April 2017, the work-related activity component was abolished for new claimants. The same applies to successful reclaims, if more than a certain time has elapsed since the last period of receipt of ESA (long-term successful claimants who had a WCA before April 2017 continue to receive it). People receiving the support component are unaffected.\n\nAn enhanced disability premium of \u00a316.80 a week may be paid to single people receiving the support component of income-related ESA; for a couple, the rate is \u00a324.10 where one or both partners qualify.\n\nIn some circumstances, an additional severe disability premium of \u00a365.85 a week may be paid.<ref name=\"ESARates\"/>\n\n==Types of ESA==\nESA can be either contributory or income-related.\n===Contributory and Income-Related ESA===\nIf claimants have paid enough [[National Insurance]] they can claim contributory ESA. Income-related ESA is for people who have not paid enough National Insurance contributions and is subject to a [[means test]] and certain other conditions (although the amount paid as contributions-based ESA can also be affected by financial circumstances). A person must have [[Capital rule|capital]] of less than \u00a316,000 to be eligible for income-based ESA.

In the parts of the UK where it already has, contribution-based ESA has been rebadged as \"new-style ESA\".\n\n===Work-Related Activity Group and Support Group===\nAfter the Work Capability Assessment, claimants are split into two groups: the Work-Related Activity Group (WRAG) and the Support Group. In February 2017, 66% of claimants were in the Support Group, 17% were in the WRAG, 13% were in the assessment phase and the phase for 3% of claimants were unknown.<ref name=\"DWPData2017ESA\">{{cite web |title=Quarterly Benefits Summary Data to February 2017 |url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/637845/dwp-quarterly-benefit-stats-summary-august-2017.pdf |website=assets.publishing.service.gov.uk |publisher=Department for Work and Pensions |accessdate=2 January 2019 |date=16 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe WRAG is for claimants who are currently unfit for work but expected to find work in the future. Claimants in the WRAG are required to participate in work-related activity or else they well be sanctioned; where their benefit payments are temporarily stopped. People who are claiming contribution-based ESA and placed in the WRAG are only allowed to claim for one year.

For this reason, Maximus encourages new claimants to send as much relevant information as possible and give a detailed description of their disability when filling in the claim form.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.chdauk.co.uk/employment-and-support-allowance-esa |title=Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) &#124; Health Assessment Advisory Service |publisher=Chdauk.co.uk |accessdate=2015-08-30 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918045856/https://www.chdauk.co.uk/employment-and-support-allowance-esa |archivedate=2016-09-18 }}</ref> The Claimant is then asked to attend a [[Work Capability Assessment]].<ref name=\"WCADWPESA\"/>\n\n===Assessing capability for work===\n{{Main|Work Capability Assessment}}\n\nThe assessment is often described as consisting of two separate assessments. In practice, if they have a face-to-face assessment, an individual claimant will experience only one assessment on the day (the decision-making is done afterwards). The two stages are:<ref name=\"WCADWPESA\"/>\n\n* The \"limited capability for work\" assessment, which determines whether the claimant is entitled to ESA at all.\n* The \"limited capability for work-related activity\" assessment, which tells the DWP whether somebody who has passed the first stage of the test is able to take part in \"work-related activity\". It also influences the rate of ESA paid to the claimant.\n \nA DWP official makes the final decision on entitlement, based on all the available evidence.\n====Limited capability for work====\nAt their WCA, an ESA claimant must be found to have limited capability for work in order to qualify at all. The testing process gauges the claimant\u2019s ability to perform up to 17 activities; these activities are set out on the ESA claim form. For each activity, a claimant can score 15, 9, 6 or 0 points: the more severe their disability, the more points they will score. Points are scored by having physical impairments, mental ones or a mixture of the two (if they are likely to significantly affect the claimant's ability to work). In order to be entitled to ESA, a person will need to score at least 15 points in total. Other factors, such as some aspects of pregnancy, are also considered by the assessor, who will be a nurse, doctor, occupational therapist or physiotherapist; these factors do not operate on a points system but might nevertheless qualify the claimant for ESA.<ref name=\"WCADWPESA\"/>\n\n====Limited capability for work-related activity====\nThis is about whether a successful claimant of ESA is capable of taking part in interviews and pre-employment training, or whether their ability to do so is limited to a significant degree. As far as the way the WCA actually operates is concerned, this is about whether the claimant has one or more severe disabilities, affecting the 17 areas which the ESA descriptors focus on. If a person is found to have a severe disability, they will be placed in the Support Group.<ref name=\"WCADWPESA\"/>\n\n==Development of ESA==\n\nESA superseded three older benefits: [[Incapacity Benefit]]; [[Income Support]] paid because of an illness or disability; and [[Severe Disablement Allowance]]. \n\n===Early Developments:1998-2007===\nA Green Paper published in 1998 proposed partially means-testing Incapacity Benefit and making deductions from the benefit payments for people receiving an occupational pension.<ref name=LSEESA>{{cite web|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/5553/1/Thatcherism_New_Labour_and_the_Welfare_State.pdf|title=Thatcherism, New Labour and the Welfare State|format=pdf|author=John Hills|date=August 1998|publisher=Centre for Analysis of Social Exclusion: London School of Economics|accessdate=9 January 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226075526/http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/5553/1/Thatcherism_New_Labour_and_the_Welfare_State.pdf|archivedate=26 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2005, the Welfare Secretary [[Alan Johnson]] announced plans to replace Incapacity Benefit with two new benefits: \"Disability and Sickness Allowance\", for people deemed too ill to work; and \"Rehabilitation Support Allowance\", paid at the same rate as Jobseekers Allowance to less disabled people, who would be supported by the DWP back into work.<ref name=BBCIBESA>{{cite web|date=2 February 2005|publisher=BBC News|title=Incapacity Benefit to be replaced|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4227991.stm|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202134224/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4227991.stm|archivedate=2 December 2008}}</ref> No benefits with these names ever materialised.\n\nIn March 2005, [[Atos]] was awarded the contract to work with the DWP to build the software programme that would be used in the assessment of claims for the allowance that would take the place of Incapacity Benefit.

A [[Public Accounts Committee (United Kingdom)|Public Accounts Committee]] report accused the DWP of haste over the transfer while failing to take legal advice or make basic checks. Evidence that people were underpaid was disregarded and warnings from its own policy advisors that it should delay and sort out the issues before proceeding were ignored.  The report said the DWP\u2019s lack of urgency - it took six years to start to deal with the error - showed \u201ca culture of indifference\u201d to people being paid too little. [[Meg Hillier]] said the affair demonstrated \u201cweakness at the highest levels\u201d of the DWP. \u201cThousands of people have not received money essential for living costs because of

It is a basic income-replacement benefit paid in lieu of wages. It is currently being phased out and replaced with [[Universal Credit]].\n\n==Eligibility for ESA==\nAn individual can put in a claim for ESA if they satisfy all of these conditions:<ref name=\"GovESAEligibility\">{{cite web |title=Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) |url=https://www.gov.uk/employment-support-allowance/eligibility |website=GOV.UK |publisher=Government Digital Service |accessdate=2 January 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n* They live in the United Kingdom\n* They are over the age of sixteen\n* They have not reached their State Pension age\n* They have a sick-note from their doctor\n\nThey will not be paid ESA if they are entitled to [[Statutory sick pay|Statutory Sick Pay]] (which is paid out by a current employer) and it is not possible to receive ESA at the same time as the other main out-of-work benefits, i.e. [[Jobseekers Allowance]] or [[Income Support]]. \n\n[[Universal Credit]], which is received by one million people nationally, can contain a component analogous to ESA.\n\n==The scale of the allowance==\nNo money is paid for the first week. After that, the basic allowance is paid to the claimant until their [[Work Capability Assessment]] (WCA) at - in theory - week 13, after which a successful claimant might receive an enhanced level of payment (depending on the level of disability and whether they enter the work-related activity group or the support group after their assessment).<ref name=\"ESARates\">{{cite web|title=ESA: what you'll get|publisher=gov.uk|url=https://www.gov.uk/employment-support-allowance/what-youll-get|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202223227/https://www.gov.uk/employment-support-allowance/what-youll-get|archivedate=2016-02-02}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''<u><big>ESA Rates for 2019/2020</big></u>'''\n|\n|\n|-\n| ||paid in weeks 2\u201313 <br>\n| paid from week 14\n\n|-\n|Basic allowance (for those aged under 25)\n|\u00a357.90 Per week ||\u00a357.90 Per week\n|-\n|Basic allowance (for those aged 25 and over)\n|\u00a373.10 Per week||\u00a373.10 Per week\n|-\n|Work-related activity component (no longer paid to new claimants)* \n| \u2014\u2014\u2014 ||\u00a329.05 Per week\n|-\n|Support component*\n| \u2014\u2014\u2014 || \u00a338.55 Per week\n|}\n\n<nowiki>* Only one of these components is payable per claim\n</nowiki>\n\nIn April 2017, the work-related activity component was abolished for new claimants. The same applies to successful reclaims, if more than a certain time has elapsed since the last period of receipt of ESA (long-term successful claimants who had a WCA before April 2017 continue to receive it). People receiving the support component are unaffected.\n\nAn enhanced disability premium of \u00a316.80 a week may be paid to single people receiving the support component of income-related ESA; for a couple, the rate is \u00a324.10 where one or both partners qualify.\n\nIn some circumstances, an additional severe disability premium of \u00a365.85 a week may be paid.<ref name=\"ESARates\"/>\n\n==Types of ESA==\nESA can be either contributory or income-related.\n===Contributory and Income-Related ESA===\nIf claimants have paid enough [[National Insurance]] they can claim contributory ESA. Income-related ESA is for people who have not paid enough National Insurance contributions and is subject to a [[means test]] and certain other conditions (although the amount paid as contributions-based ESA can also be affected by financial circumstances). A person must have [[Capital rule|capital]] of less than \u00a316,000 to be eligible for income-based ESA.

Claimants in the WRAG are required to participate in work-related activity or else they well be sanctioned; where their benefit payments are temporarily stopped. People who are claiming contribution-based ESA and placed in the WRAG are only allowed to claim for one year.

In practice, if they have a face-to-face assessment, an individual claimant will experience only one assessment on the day (the decision-making is done afterwards). The two stages are:<ref name=\"WCADWPESA\"/>\n\n* The \"limited capability for work\" assessment, which determines whether the claimant is entitled to ESA at all.\n* The \"limited capability for work-related activity\" assessment, which tells the DWP whether somebody who has passed the first stage of the test is able to take part in \"work-related activity\". It also influences the rate of ESA paid to the claimant.\n \nA DWP official makes the final decision on entitlement, based on all the available evidence.\n====Limited capability for work====\nAt their WCA, an ESA claimant must be found to have limited capability for work in order to qualify at all. The testing process gauges the claimant\u2019s ability to perform up to 17 activities; these activities are set out on the ESA claim form. For each activity, a claimant can score 15, 9, 6 or 0 points: the more severe their disability, the more points they will score. Points are scored by having physical impairments, mental ones or a mixture of the two (if they are likely to significantly affect the claimant's ability to work). In order to be entitled to ESA, a person will need to score at least 15 points in total. Other factors, such as some aspects of pregnancy, are also considered by the assessor, who will be a nurse, doctor, occupational therapist or physiotherapist; these factors do not operate on a points system but might nevertheless qualify the claimant for ESA.<ref name=\"WCADWPESA\"/>\n\n====Limited capability for work-related activity====\nThis is about whether a successful claimant of ESA is capable of taking part in interviews and pre-employment training, or whether their ability to do so is limited to a significant degree. As far as the way the WCA actually operates is concerned, this is about whether the claimant has one or more severe disabilities, affecting the 17 areas which the ESA descriptors focus on. If a person is found to have a severe disability, they will be placed in the Support Group.<ref name=\"WCADWPESA\"/>\n\n==Development of ESA==\n\nESA superseded three older benefits: [[Incapacity Benefit]]; [[Income Support]] paid because of an illness or disability; and [[Severe Disablement Allowance]]. \n\n===Early Developments:1998-2007===\nA Green Paper published in 1998 proposed partially means-testing Incapacity Benefit and making deductions from the benefit payments for people receiving an occupational pension.<ref name=LSEESA>{{cite web|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/5553/1/Thatcherism_New_Labour_and_the_Welfare_State.pdf|title=Thatcherism, New Labour and the Welfare State|format=pdf|author=John Hills|date=August 1998|publisher=Centre for Analysis of Social Exclusion: London School of Economics|accessdate=9 January 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226075526/http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/5553/1/Thatcherism_New_Labour_and_the_Welfare_State.pdf|archivedate=26 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2005, the Welfare Secretary [[Alan Johnson]] announced plans to replace Incapacity Benefit with two new benefits: \"Disability and Sickness Allowance\", for people deemed too ill to work; and \"Rehabilitation Support Allowance\", paid at the same rate as Jobseekers Allowance to less disabled people, who would be supported by the DWP back into work.<ref name=BBCIBESA>{{cite web|date=2 February 2005|publisher=BBC News|title=Incapacity Benefit to be replaced|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4227991.stm|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202134224/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4227991.stm|archivedate=2 December 2008}}</ref> No benefits with these names ever materialised.\n\nIn March 2005, [[Atos]] was awarded the contract to work with the DWP to build the software programme that would be used in the assessment of claims for the allowance that would take the place of Incapacity Benefit.

She was associated with the [[Norwich School of painters]], Britain's first provincial [[art movement]]. Along with her niece [[Eloise Harriet Stannard]], she is considered to be the finest British female still life artist of the nineteenth century.\n\nEmily Coppin was born in [[Norwich]], the daughter of [[Daniel Coppin]] and his wife [[Elizabeth Coppin|Elizabeth]] (n\u00e9e Clyatt), who were both accomplished amateur artists. In 1820, she travelled with her father to [[Netherlands|Holland]] to study the paintings of [[Jan van Huysum]] and other [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch masters]], an episode in her life which greatly influenced her work. She married the Norwich artist [[Joseph Stannard]] in 1826, but was widowed four years later, when he succumbed to [[tuberculosis]]. She continued painting until she was in her eighties, mainly depicting still life paintings of flowers in vases, fruit or game animals. Her works were exhibited in both Norwich and London. She was awarded a large gold medal in 1820 for an original painting of flowers and was awarded two further gold medals in later years. She became an honorary member of the Norwich Society of Artists in 1831, the only member of her artistic family to be formally associated with the Society.\n\nThe largest collection of her works are held by the Norfolk Museums Collections, based at [[Norwich Castle]].\n\n==Life==\n{{multiple image\n | direction = horizontal\n | width = 120\n | footer = \n | image1 = Portrait of Joseph Stannard.jpg \n | alt1 = \n | caption1 = Joseph Stannard\n | image2 = Stannard family home, Norwich.jpg\n | alt2 = \n | caption2 = Joseph and Emily Stannard's home in Norwich \n }}\n\nEmily Coppin was born on 8 February 1802 in [[Norwich]], the daughter of [[Daniel Coppin]] and his wife [[Elizabeth Coppin|Elizabeth Clyatt]].

Mrs Joseph Stannard, n\u00e9e Coppin, was one of the last remaining links of the old Norwich School of Artists. She was the widow of the well-known and excellent artist, Joseph Stannard, who died in 1830, at the early age of 34 years, in the prime of life, and while rapidly and steadily advancing in power and fame. Mrs. Stannard had a great artistic merit, was a very clever painter of fruit, flowers, fish, game, and still life, and her pictures have always been highly esteemed by lovers of art. In 1820 she received the large gold medal from the Society of Arts for an original painting of flowers. In August of the same year she went with her father to Holland, where in the Hague Gallery she made truthful copies of two precious small fruit pictures. At Trippon House, Amsterdam, she obtained permission to reproduce the celebrated Flower Pictures by Van Huysum. Her copies were greatly praised by celebrated foreign connoisseurs of the day for their close similitude of the originals. At Amsterdam she complied with the conditions laid down by showing two specimens of her painting, the President of the Amsterdam Gallery, Mons. Apostal, expressing great satisfaction with her work, and she was allowed to make a copy of another Van Huysum. In 1821 she was presented with the large gold medal of the Society of Arts, London, for an original painting of fruit. In 1828, as Mrs. Joseph Stannard, she received the gold medal for an original painting of game. As late as 1870 she exhibited in an exhibition at Norwich two very pictures of flowers and song birds, elaborately and beautifully painted, both of them brilliant and effective, which were very highly spoken of in the local journals at the time. Her kindly, gentle, modest, and simple nature endeared her to all who had the pleasure of her acquaintance, by whom she will ever be remembered with great esteem, regard, and affection. Many of the last years of her life were smoothed and cheered by the loving care and companionship of an only daughter, to whom we tender our sincere sympathy\".<ref>{{cite news\n| date         = 17 January 1885\n| title        = The late Mrs. Joseph Stannard\n| url          = https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/search/results/1885-01-17?basicsearch=joseph%20stannard&exactsearch=false&county=norfolk%2c%20england&retrievecountrycounts=false&mostspecificlocation=norfolk%2c%20england&newspapertitle=norfolk%2bchronicle\n|url-access=subscription\n| work    = The Norfolk Chronicle\n| location     = Norwich\n| publisher = The British Newspaper Archive\n| access-date  = 5 April 2019\n}}</ref>|group=note}}\n\nHer gold medals were donated by her daughter to the new museum at [[Norwich Castle]] in 1894.{{sfn|Hill|2016}}{{refn|1=The museum described them as \"Three Gold Medals inscribed the \"Society of Arts and Commerce Promoted\" awarded to Mrs. Joseph Stannard for painting, and the Silver \"Honorary Pallet of the Society for Promoting Arts, Manufacturer and Commerce,\" awarded to Mrs. Coppin for Drawing\".<ref>Norwich Castle Museum Committee (1894), p. 15.</ref> Emily also donated the paintings of her parents and her grandmother Elizabeth Coppin, in what the author Kate Hill described as \"an unusual example of an attempt to memorialise women artists\".{{sfn|Hill|2016}}|group=note}} \n\nEmily Stannard continued to live at Cathedral Street until her death in 1894 at the age of 67.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk|title= Eastern Evening News|author=<!--Not stated--> |date= 24 November 1894|website= British Newspaper Archive|access-date= 14 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Background===\n{{further|Norwich School of painters}}\n\nThe Norwich School of painters was a unique phenomenon in the history of British 19th century art.{{sfn|Moore|1985|p=9}} [[Norwich]] was the first English city outside London where a school of artists arose.{{sfn|Cundall|1920|p=1}} It had more local-born artists than any subsequently-formed schools elsewhere,{{sfn|Hemingway|1979|pp=9, 79}} its most important artists being [[John Crome]], Emily Stannard's husband [[Joseph Stannard]], [[George Vincent (painter)|George Vincent]], [[Robert Ladbrooke]], [[James Stark (painter)|James Stark]], [[John Thirtle]] and [[John Sell Cotman]].{{sfn|Hemingway|1988|p=17}} The Norwich School artists were connected by geographical location, their depiction of Norwich and rural [[Norfolk]], and by close personal and professional relationships.{{refn|1=The Stannards were the most conspicuous family of still-life painters in nineteenth century England. [[Alfred Stannard]] and his older brother Joseph specialised in painting [[Landscape painting|landscapes]] and [[marine art]], but with the encouragement of Emily Stannard included still-life works in their repertoire. Her niece [[Eloise Harriet Stannard]] in turn became a prominent painter flowers and fruit.{{sfn|Nunn|1995|p=39}}|group=note}} By the end of the 19th century the paintings by the artists of the Norwich School, who had once been regarded as modern and progressive, were seen as belonging to a bygone age, a view that Professor [[Andrew Hemingway (art historian)|Andrew Hemingway]] has attributed to the \"mythology of rural Englishness\" that prevailed at the start of the 20th century.{{sfn|Hemingway|1988|p=30}}\n\nThe Norwich Society of Artists was founded in 1803.{{sfn|Rajnai|Stevens|1976|p=13}} It held annual exhibitions from 1805 to 1825 and again from 1828 until its dissolution in 1833.{{sfn|Rajnai|Stevens|1976|p=4}} Members of the Stannard family showed their pictures at the exhibitions, but they had few other artistic connections with their Norwich contemporaries. Emily Stannard, who became an honorary member of the Society in 1831, was the only member of the Stannard family to have a formal association with the Society.{{sfn|Moore|1985|p=95}}\n\n===Teaching===\n\nEmily, assisted by her daughter, had a career as an art teacher.{{sfn|Gray|2009|p=249}} Hardly any information about this aspect of her life is provided by her past or present biographers.\n\n===Works===\n[[File:Emily-Coppin-Stannard still-life-1824.jpg|thumb|''Floral still life with a silver-gilt cup'' (1824)]]\n[[File:Emily Coppin Stannard - Still Life with Mallard Snipes and Gold Medals.jpg|thumb|''Still Life with Mallard Snipes and Gold Medals'']]\n\nEmily Stannard and her niece [[Eloise Harriet Stannard]] are nowadays considered to be the finest British women still life painters of the nineteenth century.{{sfn|Walpole|1997|pp=58\u201359}} Stannard's early paintings were influenced by the Dutch masters Huysum and De Heem.{{Ambiguous|date=December 2018}}{{sfn|Moore|1985|p=104}} Both her depiction of vases and the finish of her depiction of flowers owed much to Huysum, and her unsigned works were sometimes attributed to 18th century Dutch painters.{{sfn|Mitchell|1973|pp=242\u20134}} ''Still life: Dead Ducks and a Hare with a Basket and Sprig of Holly'' reveals her debt to [[Jan Weenix]], whose work ''Dead Hare and Partidges'' she presumably saw when it was exhibited at the [[British Institution]]. Paintings by Dutch masters at [[English country house|country houses]] in Norfolk (such as at [[Wolterton Hall]]) may also have been available to her.{{sfn|Moore|1988|p=144}}\n\nShe first exhibited her works in 1816.{{sfn|Rajnai|Stevens|1976|p=87}} In 1821, aged seventeen, she was awarded the Norwich Society of Artists' gold medal for one of her flower paintings.{{sfn|Moore|1985|p=96}} She won a second medal the following year for a painting of a collection of fruit.{{sfn|Gray|2009|p=249}} She received a third gold medal in 1828 for a still life of game animals,{{sfn|Mackie|1901|p=354}} which was exhibited at the Norwich Society of Artists as ''Dead Game from Nature''.{{sfn|Rajnai|Stevens|1976|p=87}} Throughout her long career, which continued until shortly before her death at the age of 82, she continued to depict [[Flower bouquet|bouquets of flowers in vases]] and other traditional still life paintings of tableware, fruit or [[Game (hunting)|game animals]], set against monochrome backgrounds.{{sfn|Vincent|1992}}{{sfn|Walpole|1997|pp=58\u20139}}\n\nAlthough she usually exhibited her work in Norwich, she also exhibited paintings at the [[Royal Society of British Artists]] in 1824 and the [[British Institution]] from 1823 to 1825.{{sfn|Gray|2009|p=249}}\n\nAccording to the art historian and author Josephine Walpole, Emily Stannard's paintings display a \"natural talent\" and \"impeccable colour sense\".{{sfn|Walpole|1997|p=58}} According to Andrew Moore, her technique and command of composition strengthened in the years after her husband's death.{{sfn|Moore|1985|p=105}}\n\nOn least one occasion she signed a painting using her Christian name,{{sfn|Mitchell|1973|pp=242\u20134}} but her works are invariably signed 'Mrs. Joseph Stannard'. Her canvasses, which were often left unvarnished, were consistently painted with a thin, diluted paint, in a similar way to the works of the Dutch masters she studied.{{sfn|Moore|1988|p=144}}\n\nThe Norfolk Museums Collections is the only United Kingdom public art collection which possesses works by Emily Stannard. Her paintings there are: ''Still life: hamper with dead wood pigeon and leveret''; ''Still life: dead ducks and a hare with a basket and a sprig of holly'' (1853); ''Still life with dead game and a flagon and a string of onions'' (1847); ''Dead game and a gun'' (1835); ''Dead game'' (1837); ''Flowers''; ''Still life: group of dead game birds''; and ''Wild duck (study)''.{{sfn|Wright| Gordon|2006|p=743}}\n\nPrices paid for her paintings include \u00a3400 for ''Still life study of dead birds on a table oil on board'' in 2017, \u00a31600 for ''Still Life Study of Mixed Flowers and Fruit in Basket on Marble Ledge'' in 2015, \u00a3920 for ''Still Life Study of Mixed Flowers, Birds Nest and Butterfly on Marble Ledge'' in 2015, and \u00a3130 for a [[watercolour painting]]

Stannard''', was a British [[still life]] painter. She was associated with the [[Norwich School of painters]], Britain's first provincial [[art movement]]. Along with her niece [[Eloise Harriet Stannard]], she is considered to be the finest British female still life artist of the nineteenth century.\n\nEmily Coppin was born in [[Norwich]], the daughter of [[Daniel Coppin]] and his wife [[Elizabeth Coppin|Elizabeth]] (n\u00e9e Clyatt), who were both accomplished amateur artists. In 1820, she travelled with her father to [[Netherlands|Holland]] to study the paintings of [[Jan van Huysum]] and other [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch masters]], an episode in her life which greatly influenced her work. She married the Norwich artist [[Joseph Stannard]] in 1826, but was widowed four years later, when he succumbed to [[tuberculosis]]. She continued painting until she was in her eighties, mainly depicting still life paintings of flowers in vases, fruit or game animals. Her works were exhibited in both Norwich and London. She was awarded a large gold medal in 1820 for an original painting of flowers and was awarded two further gold medals in later years. She became an honorary member of the Norwich Society of Artists in 1831, the only member of her artistic family to be formally associated with the Society.\n\nThe largest collection of her works are held by the Norfolk Museums Collections, based at [[Norwich Castle]].\n\n==Life==\n{{multiple image\n | direction = horizontal\n | width = 120\n | footer = \n | image1 = Portrait of Joseph Stannard.jpg \n | alt1 = \n | caption1 = Joseph Stannard\n | image2 = Stannard family home, Norwich.jpg\n | alt2 = \n | caption2 = Joseph and Emily Stannard's home in Norwich \n }}\n\nEmily Coppin was born on 8 February 1802 in [[Norwich]], the daughter of [[Daniel Coppin]] and his wife [[Elizabeth Coppin|Elizabeth Clyatt]].

Mrs Joseph Stannard, n\u00e9e Coppin, was one of the last remaining links of the old Norwich School of Artists. She was the widow of the well-known and excellent artist, Joseph Stannard, who died in 1830, at the early age of 34 years, in the prime of life, and while rapidly and steadily advancing in power and fame. Mrs. Stannard had a great artistic merit, was a very clever painter of fruit, flowers, fish, game, and still life, and her pictures have always been highly esteemed by lovers of art. In 1820 she received the large gold medal from the Society of Arts for an original painting of flowers. In August of the same year she went with her father to Holland, where in the Hague Gallery she made truthful copies of two precious small fruit pictures. At Trippon House, Amsterdam, she obtained permission to reproduce the celebrated Flower Pictures by Van Huysum. Her copies were greatly praised by celebrated foreign connoisseurs of the day for their close similitude of the originals. At Amsterdam she complied with the conditions laid down by showing two specimens of her painting, the President of the Amsterdam Gallery, Mons. Apostal, expressing great satisfaction with her work, and she was allowed to make a copy of another Van Huysum. In 1821 she was presented with the large gold medal of the Society of Arts, London, for an original painting of fruit. In 1828, as Mrs. Joseph Stannard, she received the gold medal for an original painting of game. As late as 1870 she exhibited in an exhibition at Norwich two very pictures of flowers and song birds, elaborately and beautifully painted, both of them brilliant and effective, which were very highly spoken of in the local journals at the time. Her kindly, gentle, modest, and simple nature endeared her to all who had the pleasure of her acquaintance, by whom she will ever be remembered with great esteem, regard, and affection. Many of the last years of her life were smoothed and cheered by the loving care and companionship of an only daughter, to whom we tender our sincere sympathy\".<ref>{{cite news\n| date         = 17 January 1885\n| title        = The late Mrs. Joseph Stannard\n| url          = https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/search/results/1885-01-17?basicsearch=joseph%20stannard&exactsearch=false&county=norfolk%2c%20england&retrievecountrycounts=false&mostspecificlocation=norfolk%2c%20england&newspapertitle=norfolk%2bchronicle\n|url-access=subscription\n| work    = The Norfolk Chronicle\n| location     = Norwich\n| publisher = The British Newspaper Archive\n| access-date  = 5 April 2019\n}}</ref>|group=note}}\n\nHer gold medals were donated by her daughter to the new museum at [[Norwich Castle]] in 1894.{{sfn|Hill|2016}}{{refn|1=The museum described them as \"Three Gold Medals inscribed the \"Society of Arts and Commerce Promoted\" awarded to Mrs. Joseph Stannard for painting, and the Silver \"Honorary Pallet of the Society for Promoting Arts, Manufacturer and Commerce,\" awarded to Mrs. Coppin for Drawing\".<ref>Norwich Castle Museum Committee (1894), p. 15.</ref> Emily also donated the paintings of her parents and her grandmother Elizabeth Coppin, in what the author Kate Hill described as \"an unusual example of an attempt to memorialise women artists\".{{sfn|Hill|2016}}|group=note}} \n\nEmily Stannard continued to live at Cathedral Street until her death in 1894 at the age of 67.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk|title= Eastern Evening News|author=<!--Not stated--> |date= 24 November 1894|website= British Newspaper Archive|access-date= 14 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Background===\n{{further|Norwich School of painters}}\n\nThe Norwich School of painters was a unique phenomenon in the history of British 19th century art.{{sfn|Moore|1985|p=9}} [[Norwich]] was the first English city outside London where a school of artists arose.{{sfn|Cundall|1920|p=1}} It had more local-born artists than any subsequently-formed schools elsewhere,{{sfn|Hemingway|1979|pp=9, 79}} its most important artists being [[John Crome]], Emily Stannard's husband [[Joseph Stannard]], [[George Vincent (painter)|George Vincent]], [[Robert Ladbrooke]], [[James Stark (painter)|James Stark]], [[John Thirtle]] and [[John Sell Cotman]].{{sfn|Hemingway|1988|p=17}} The Norwich School artists were connected by geographical location, their depiction of Norwich and rural [[Norfolk]], and by close personal and professional relationships.{{refn|1=The Stannards were the most conspicuous family of still-life painters in nineteenth century England. [[Alfred Stannard]] and his older brother Joseph specialised in painting [[Landscape painting|landscapes]] and [[marine art]], but with the encouragement of Emily Stannard included still-life works in their repertoire. Her niece [[Eloise Harriet Stannard]] in turn became a prominent painter flowers and fruit.{{sfn|Nunn|1995|p=39}}|group=note}} By the end of the 19th century the paintings by the artists of the Norwich School, who had once been regarded as modern and progressive, were seen as belonging to a bygone age, a view that Professor [[Andrew Hemingway (art historian)|Andrew Hemingway]] has attributed to the \"mythology of rural Englishness\" that prevailed at the start of the 20th century.{{sfn|Hemingway|1988|p=30}}\n\nThe Norwich Society of Artists was founded in 1803.{{sfn|Rajnai|Stevens|1976|p=13}} It held annual exhibitions from 1805 to 1825 and again from 1828 until its dissolution in 1833.{{sfn|Rajnai|Stevens|1976|p=4}} Members of the Stannard family showed their pictures at the exhibitions, but they had few other artistic connections with their Norwich contemporaries. Emily Stannard, who became an honorary member of the Society in 1831, was the only member of the Stannard family to have a formal association with the Society.{{sfn|Moore|1985|p=95}}\n\n===Teaching===\n\nEmily, assisted by her daughter, had a career as an art teacher.{{sfn|Gray|2009|p=249}} Hardly any information about this aspect of her life is provided by her past or present biographers.\n\n===Works===\n[[File:Emily-Coppin-Stannard still-life-1824.jpg|thumb|''Floral still life with a silver-gilt cup'' (1824)]]\n[[File:Emily Coppin Stannard - Still Life with Mallard Snipes and Gold Medals.jpg|thumb|''Still Life with Mallard Snipes and Gold Medals'']]\n\nEmily Stannard and her niece [[Eloise Harriet Stannard]] are nowadays considered to be the finest British women still life painters of the nineteenth century.{{sfn|Walpole|1997|pp=58\u201359}} Stannard's early paintings were influenced by the Dutch masters Huysum and De Heem.{{Ambiguous|date=December 2018}}{{sfn|Moore|1985|p=104}} Both her depiction of vases and the finish of her depiction of flowers owed much to Huysum, and her unsigned works were sometimes attributed to 18th century Dutch painters.{{sfn|Mitchell|1973|pp=242\u20134}} ''Still life: Dead Ducks and a Hare with a Basket and Sprig of Holly'' reveals her debt to [[Jan Weenix]], whose work ''Dead Hare and Partidges'' she presumably saw when it was exhibited at the [[British Institution]]. Paintings by Dutch masters at [[English country house|country houses]] in Norfolk (such as at [[Wolterton Hall]]) may also have been available to her.{{sfn|Moore|1988|p=144}}\n\nShe first exhibited her works in 1816.{{sfn|Rajnai|Stevens|1976|p=87}} In 1821, aged seventeen, she was awarded the Norwich Society of Artists' gold medal for one of her flower paintings.{{sfn|Moore|1985|p=96}} She won a second medal the following year for a painting of a collection of fruit.{{sfn|Gray|2009|p=249}} She received a third gold medal in 1828 for a still life of game animals,{{sfn|Mackie|1901|p=354}} which was exhibited at the Norwich Society of Artists as ''Dead Game from Nature''.{{sfn|Rajnai|Stevens|1976|p=87}} Throughout her long career, which continued until shortly before her death at the age of 82, she continued to depict [[Flower bouquet|bouquets of flowers in vases]] and other traditional still life paintings of tableware, fruit or [[Game (hunting)|game animals]], set against monochrome backgrounds.{{sfn|Vincent|1992}}{{sfn|Walpole|1997|pp=58\u20139}}\n\nAlthough she usually exhibited her work in Norwich, she also exhibited paintings at the [[Royal Society of British Artists]] in 1824 and the [[British Institution]] from 1823 to 1825.{{sfn|Gray|2009|p=249}}\n\nAccording to the art historian and author Josephine Walpole, Emily Stannard's paintings display a \"natural talent\" and \"impeccable colour sense\".{{sfn|Walpole|1997|p=58}} According to Andrew Moore, her technique and command of composition strengthened in the years after her husband's death.{{sfn|Moore|1985|p=105}}\n\nOn least one occasion she signed a painting using her Christian name,{{sfn|Mitchell|1973|pp=242\u20134}} but her works are invariably signed 'Mrs. Joseph Stannard'. Her canvasses, which were often left unvarnished, were consistently painted with a thin, diluted paint, in a similar way to the works of the Dutch masters she studied.{{sfn|Moore|1988|p=144}}\n\nThe Norfolk Museums Collections is the only United Kingdom public art collection which possesses works by Emily Stannard. Her paintings there are: ''Still life: hamper with dead wood pigeon and leveret''; ''Still life: dead ducks and a hare with a basket and a sprig of holly'' (1853); ''Still life with dead game and a flagon and a string of onions'' (1847);

The FSIS draws its authority from the [[Federal Meat Inspection Act of 1906]], the [[Poultry Products Inspection Act of 1957]] and the [[Egg Products Inspection Act of 1970]]. The FSIS also acts as a national health department and is responsible for the safety of public food-related establishments as well as business investigation.\n\nFood products under the jurisdiction of the FSIS, and thus subject to inspection, are those that contain more than 3% meat or 2% poultry products, with several exceptions,<ref>{{cite web|title=Food Standards and Labeling Policy Book|url=http://www.fsis.usda.gov/OPPDE/larc/Policies/Labeling_Policy_book_082005.pdf|accessdate=September 21, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205112343/http://www.fsis.usda.gov/OPPDE/larc/Policies/Labeling_Policy_Book_082005.pdf|archive-date=February 5, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> and egg products (liquid, frozen or dried). Shell eggs, meat and poultry products not under the jurisdiction of the FSIS are under the jurisdiction of the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA). The FSIS is led by the [[Under Secretary of Agriculture for Food Safety]].\n\n== Overview ==\nMore than 7,800 FSIS inspection program personnel are assigned to about 6,200 Federal slaughter, [[food processing]], and import establishments in the [[United States]]. They verify the processing of tens of billions of pounds of meat and poultry, and billions of pounds of egg products. At slaughter establishments, inspectors perform antemortem inspections to prevent slaughter of diseased animals. Then, [[postmortem]] examinations are performed to identify diseased carcasses not evident [[antemortem]]. Regulations for rapid chilling, adequate trimming and sanitary washing are enforced to reduce microbial contamination. Samples are collected for residue testing to ensure antibiotic, pesticide and other residues are below regulatory limits. For cattle, tissue samples are tested for the presence of [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]]. In processing plants, procedures and formulations are monitored to ensure that FSIS requirements and standards of identity are met. Inspectors in egg plants primarily monitor pasteurization. In all plants, sanitation, net weight and accurate labeling (including nutrition information) regulations are enforced. FSIS also is responsible for products presented for import inspection at ports and borders, from countries that FSIS has determined to have inspection systems equivalent to Federal inspection systems.\n\nEveryone in the food chain, from farmer through consumer, has a responsibility in keeping the food supply safe. Meat, poultry, and processed egg products can be contaminated with bacteria at any point during production, distribution, and consumption. FDA works closely with other federal agencies that have some role in the regulation of meat, poultry, and processed egg products along the [[farm-to-table]] continuum.\n\nFSIS is a separate and distinct agency independent from the FDA.  FSIS is under the direction of the Department of Agriculture<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fsis.usda.gov/About_FSIS/index.asp|title=About Us}}</ref> while the FDA is under the direction of the [[Department of Health and Human Services]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/fda-organization|title=FDA Organization|first=Office of the|last=Commissioner|date=March 22, 2019|website=FDA}}</ref>  The two agencies share responsibilities on various topics concerning food safety, but have different methods of enforcement and supervision of food producers.  For example, both FSIS and the FDA have the authority to regulate food labeling.  In March 2014, FSIS implemented a new regulatory requirement for labeling; 9 CFR Part 412. At times, FSIS requires a food producer to obtain pre-market approval of their intended label before the product is entered into the stream of commerce<ref>21 U.S.C. 607(d) and 21 U.S.C. 457(c)</ref> (for products under their jurisdiction. If product is covered by a standard of identity and meets the established standard, then pre-market approval is not necessary. The FDA does not require that a food producer, in their jurisdiction, obtain pre-market approval of their label.<ref>P.L. 75-717</ref>  FSIS takes a preemptive role in food labeling where the FDA takes a reactive role in food labeling. The FSIS also has authority in inspection and monitoring of food-related establishments, while the FDA has no jurisdiction regarding restaurants and food businesses.\n\nFSIS derives its authority from the [[Meat Inspection Act|Federal Meat Inspection Act of 1906]],<ref>59th Congress Session I 34 Stat. 669</ref> the [[Poultry Products Inspection Act of 1957]],<ref>P.L. 85-172</ref> and the Egg Products Inspection Act of 1970.<ref>P.L. 91-597 Proposed Amendment: H.R. 3798</ref>  FSIS inspects meat and poultry products to ensure that there is no misbranded<ref>The Federal Meat Inspection Act defines \"Misbranded\" \n#if the product's labeling is false or misleading in any particular way; \n#if it is offered for sale under the name of another food; \n#If it is an imitation of another food, unless it is labeled as such; \n#if its container is misleading; #unless it bears a label with the name of the manufacturer, distributor, and net quantity of contents; \n#if its labeling is not prominent and conspicuous; \n#if it purports to be a food with a standard of identity without conforming to the standard; \n#if it misrepresents itself as a food with standard of fill; \n#if it does not bear a common or usual name (provided it is not covered by a standard of identity) and declare ingredients by common or usual name; \n#if it purports to be a food for special dietary use without conforming to FDA regulations on such products; \n#if it contains artificial flavoring, artificial coloring, or chemical preservatives that are not declared (with exceptions); and \n#if it fails to bear an inspection legend and establishment number.</ref> or adulterated<ref>The Federal Meat Inspection Act of 1906 defines \"Adultered\" \n#if any substance has been mixed and packed with it so as to reduce or lower or injuriously affect its quality or strength; \n#if any substance has been substituted wholly or in part for the article; \n#if any valuable constituent of the article has been wholly or in part abstracted; \n#if it be mixed, colored, powdered, coated or stained in a manner whereby damage or inferiority is concealed; \n#if it contain any added poisonous or other added deleterious ingredient which may render such article injurious to health; \n#if it consists in whole or in part of a filthy, decomposed, or putrid animal or vegetable substance, or any portion of an animal unfit for food, whether manufactured or not, or if it is the product of a diseased animal, or one that has died otherwise than by slaughter.</ref> products being put into the stream of commerce.\n\n== Recalls ==\n{{Main|Product recall}}\n\nRecalls are voluntary actions by manufacturers, distributors or importers to protect the public by removing from commerce products that are adulterated or misbranded. The majority of recalls in recent years have been due to undeclared allergens on product labels.\n\nAs soon as FSIS learns that a meat or poultry product under its jurisdiction may be unsafe or mislabeled is in commerce, the agency forms a team to determine whether a recall is needed. The Recall Committee is composed of FSIS representatives from various areas of expertise.

The FSIS draws its authority from the [[Federal Meat Inspection Act of 1906]], the [[Poultry Products Inspection Act of 1957]] and the [[Egg Products Inspection Act of 1970]]. The FSIS also acts as a national health department and is responsible for the safety of public food-related establishments as well as business investigation.\n\nFood products under the jurisdiction of the FSIS, and thus subject to inspection, are those that contain more than 3% meat or 2% poultry products, with several exceptions,<ref>{{cite web|title=Food Standards and Labeling Policy Book|url=http://www.fsis.usda.gov/OPPDE/larc/Policies/Labeling_Policy_book_082005.pdf|accessdate=September 21, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205112343/http://www.fsis.usda.gov/OPPDE/larc/Policies/Labeling_Policy_Book_082005.pdf|archive-date=February 5, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> and egg products (liquid, frozen or dried). Shell eggs, meat and poultry products not under the jurisdiction of the FSIS are under the jurisdiction of the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA). The FSIS is led by the [[Under Secretary of Agriculture for Food Safety]].\n\n== Overview ==\nMore than 7,800 FSIS inspection program personnel are assigned to about 6,200 Federal slaughter, [[food processing]], and import establishments in the [[United States]]. They verify the processing of tens of billions of pounds of meat and poultry, and billions of pounds of egg products. At slaughter establishments, inspectors perform antemortem inspections to prevent slaughter of diseased animals. Then, [[postmortem]] examinations are performed to identify diseased carcasses not evident [[antemortem]]. Regulations for rapid chilling, adequate trimming and sanitary washing are enforced to reduce microbial contamination. Samples are collected for residue testing to ensure antibiotic, pesticide and other residues are below regulatory limits. For cattle, tissue samples are tested for the presence of [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]]. In processing plants, procedures and formulations are monitored to ensure that FSIS requirements and standards of identity are met. Inspectors in egg plants primarily monitor pasteurization. In all plants, sanitation, net weight and accurate labeling (including nutrition information) regulations are enforced. FSIS also is responsible for products presented for import inspection at ports and borders, from countries that FSIS has determined to have inspection systems equivalent to Federal inspection systems.\n\nEveryone in the food chain, from farmer through consumer, has a responsibility in keeping the food supply safe. Meat, poultry, and processed egg products can be contaminated with bacteria at any point during production, distribution, and consumption. FDA works closely with other federal agencies that have some role in the regulation of meat, poultry, and processed egg products along the [[farm-to-table]] continuum.\n\nFSIS is a separate and distinct agency independent from the FDA.  FSIS is under the direction of the Department of Agriculture<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fsis.usda.gov/About_FSIS/index.asp|title=About Us}}</ref> while the FDA is under the direction of the [[Department of Health and Human Services]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/fda-organization|title=FDA Organization|first=Office of the|last=Commissioner|date=March 22, 2019|website=FDA}}</ref>  The two agencies share responsibilities on various topics concerning food safety, but have different methods of enforcement and supervision of food producers.  For example, both FSIS and the FDA have the authority to regulate food labeling.  In March 2014, FSIS implemented a new regulatory requirement for labeling; 9 CFR Part 412. At times, FSIS requires a food producer to obtain pre-market approval of their intended label before the product is entered into the stream of commerce<ref>21 U.S.C. 607(d) and 21 U.S.C. 457(c)</ref> (for products under their jurisdiction. If product is covered by a standard of identity and meets the established standard, then pre-market approval is not necessary. The FDA does not require that a food producer, in their jurisdiction, obtain pre-market approval of their label.<ref>P.L. 75-717</ref>  FSIS takes a preemptive role in food labeling where the FDA takes a reactive role in food labeling. The FSIS also has authority in inspection and monitoring of food-related establishments, while the FDA has no jurisdiction regarding restaurants and food businesses.\n\nFSIS derives its authority from the [[Meat Inspection Act|Federal Meat Inspection Act of 1906]],<ref>59th Congress Session I 34 Stat. 669</ref> the [[Poultry Products Inspection Act of 1957]],<ref>P.L. 85-172</ref> and the Egg Products Inspection Act of 1970.<ref>P.L. 91-597 Proposed Amendment: H.R. 3798</ref>  FSIS inspects meat and poultry products to ensure that there is no misbranded<ref>The Federal Meat Inspection Act defines \"Misbranded\" \n#if the product's labeling is false or misleading in any particular way; \n#if it is offered for sale under the name of another food; \n#If it is an imitation of another food, unless it is labeled as such; \n#if its container is misleading; #unless it bears a label with the name of the manufacturer, distributor, and net quantity of contents; \n#if its labeling is not prominent and conspicuous; \n#if it purports to be a food with a standard of identity without conforming to the standard; \n#if it misrepresents itself as a food with standard of fill; \n#if it does not bear a common or usual name (provided it is not covered by a standard of identity) and declare ingredients by common or usual name; \n#if it purports to be a food for special dietary use without conforming to FDA regulations on such products; \n#if it contains artificial flavoring, artificial coloring, or chemical preservatives that are not declared (with exceptions); and \n#if it fails to bear an inspection legend and establishment number.</ref> or adulterated<ref>The Federal Meat Inspection Act of 1906 defines \"Adultered\" \n#if any substance has been mixed and packed with it so as to reduce or lower or injuriously affect its quality or strength; \n#if any substance has been substituted wholly or in part for the article; \n#if any valuable constituent of the article has been wholly or in part abstracted; \n#if it be mixed, colored, powdered, coated or stained in a manner whereby damage or inferiority is concealed; \n#if it contain any added poisonous or other added deleterious ingredient which may render such article injurious to health; \n#if it consists in whole or in part of a filthy, decomposed, or putrid animal or vegetable substance, or any portion of an animal unfit for food, whether manufactured or not, or if it is the product of a diseased animal, or one that has died otherwise than by slaughter.</ref> products being put into the stream of commerce.\n\n== Recalls ==\n{{Main|Product recall}}\n\nRecalls are voluntary actions by manufacturers, distributors or importers to protect the public by removing from commerce products that are adulterated or misbranded. The majority of recalls in recent years have been due to undeclared allergens on product labels.\n\nAs soon as FSIS learns that a meat or poultry product under its jurisdiction may be unsafe or mislabeled is in commerce, the agency forms a team to determine whether a recall is needed. The Recall Committee is composed of FSIS representatives from various areas of expertise. The committee evaluates all the information available and makes a recommendation to the establishment whose product is in question, including the parameters of the recall.\n\nAfter a recall is issued, FSIS conducts effectiveness checks to ensure that the company\u2019s customers (or consignees) have received notice of the recall and are making every effort to retrieve and destroy the recalled product or return it to the recalling firm. FSIS personnel verify that the recalling firm has been diligent and successful in notifying and advising their consignees of the need to retrieve and control recalled product, and that the consignees have responded accordingly. FSIS has formal agreements with many state governments that allow those states to participate in effectiveness checks, thus improving the speed and effectiveness of recalls.\n\nWhen a product is recalled, FSIS issues a recall release to the media in the affected area, sends it to public health partners and stakeholders and posts it on the FSIS Web site.\n\nIn certain situations where a recall is not warranted, but there is still a risk to public health, FSIS may issue a public health alert.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls/Public_Health_Alerts/index.asp |title=Public Health Alerts |publisher=Fsis.usda.gov |date= |accessdate=May 15, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404064934/http://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls/Public_Health_Alerts/index.asp |archive-date=April 4, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> PHAs have been issued when a product was not considered adulterated, but illnesses were involved; when illnesses were associated with a meat or poultry product, but a source of contamination was not identified; or a product is no longer available in commerce, but may be held or in use by consumers.\n\nThe FSIS also acts as an investigation organization involved in food-related businesses if suspicions regarding consumer safety or criminal abuse arise.
