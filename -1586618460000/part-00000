The main reason for the withdrawal was due to a problem in the amount of franchise fee to be paid by the Pune team. Sahara insisted that it had bid a huge amount for the Pune franchise under the notion that there would be 94 matches in the 2011 IPL season. As the BCCI later reduced the number of IPL matches to 74, Sahara demanded for a reduction in the amount of franchise fee to be paid by them to maintain viable IPL proposition.<ref name=\"pune out\"/> Other reasons included disputes between Sahara and the BCCI regarding the IPL rules, such as player retention and the 4-foreign player rule and also the refusal on the part of the BCCI to allow Pune to add Yuvraj Singh's price to their auction purse so that they could buy another player as a replacement for Yuvraj.

It was also decided that Pune could replace Yuvraj with one player, whose fees would be up to $1.8 million. IPL's trading window was extended up to 29 February 2012 to allow the team to purchase players. Pune was also allowed the compensation of playing 5 foreign players in the squad, subject to the consent of the other 8 franchises. The BCCI also allowed Sahara to have a strategic partner in the franchise. Pune's new stadium would be allowed to host one of the play-off matches, provided [[Royal Challengers Bangalore]] gave consent, because according to a BCCI rule, the right to host the play-off matches is given to the finalist of the previous edition.

The franchise also swapped a player with the Delhi Daredevils, trading Nehra for [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] batsman [[Ross Taylor]].<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2013/content/story/604641.html Delhi swap Taylor for Pune's Nehra]</ref> Yuvraj also returned to the team following his recovery from cancer. Unfortunately for the franchise, Clarke, who was the frontrunner to lead the team, was ruled out of the entire season with a recurring back and hamstring injury, which was aggravated during the [[Australian cricket team in India in 2012\u201313|Australian tour of India]] held earlier.<ref>[http://sports.ndtv.com/indian-premier-league-2013/news/205416-michael-clarke-out-for-10-weeks-pune-warriors-have-to-hunt-for-new-captain Michael Clarke ruled out of IPL 6, Pune Warriors have to hunt for new captain]</ref> On 28 March 2013, the franchise named Sri Lankan Test and ODI captain and all-rounder Angelo Mathews as the captain for the 2013 season<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2013/content/story/627151.html Angelo Mathews named Pune Warriors' captain]</ref> and also signed Australian batsman [[Aaron Finch]] as a replacement for Clarke.<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/ipl-pune/content/story/627230.html Finch to replace Clarke for Pune Warriors]</ref>\n\nThe team's performance in the 2013 season was pathetic and mirrored its performance in 2012 with 4 wins and 12 losses in 16 matches, finishing 8th and second-last in the league. The only matches the team won were against [[Rajasthan Royals]] (home), Chennai Super Kings (away), Kolkata Knight Riders (away) and Delhi Daredevils (home). The Warriors were thoroughly humiliated in their away match against Royal Challengers Bangalore, courtesy [[Chris Gayle]]'s 175 not out off only 66 balls and later became the first team in the 2013 season to be knocked out of contention for the playoffs after a loss to Chennai Super Kings at home. Like the previous seasons, the main cause for the team's poor performance was their constant squandering of winning chances and the lack of balance in the side, with more than 30 players being used during the season. The team was the only IPL franchise to use three captains that season. Mathews was sacked as captain following a poor start by the Warriors in the tournament and his own poor form and was replaced by Taylor for the away match against Chennai Super Kings. Following this match, Taylor was also sacked as captain due to his poor form, in spite of the team winning in Chennai, and was replaced by Finch, who captained the Warriors for the rest of the season.\n\n===Second and final withdrawal from IPL===\nOn 21 May 2013, just two days after finishing its league campaign, Sahara withdrew Pune Warriors India from the IPL for the second time in three years.<ref name=\"pullout\"/> The reason, according to BCCI, was the encashing of the team's bank guarantee after Sahara defaulted on paying the entire franchise fee.<ref name=\"pullout\"/> BCCI sources said that Sahara paid 20% of the franchise fee in January 2013 and had promised to pay the remaining amount by 19 May 2013 but they failed to do so.<ref name=\"pune gone\">[http://sports.ndtv.com/indian-premier-league-2013/news/208101-ipl-6-bcci-encashes-bank-guarantee-after-pune-warriors-fail-to-pay-franchisee-fee BCCI encashes bank guarantee after Pune Warriors fail to pay franchisee fee]</ref> But Sahara blamed BCCI for the decision to pull out the Pune franchise from the IPL. In a statement from Sahara after pulling out Pune Warriors India from the IPL, it stated that Sahara had to pull out of IPL due to the BCCI's stubborn and disinterested attitude towards the reduction of the Pune team's franchise fee.<ref name=\"pune out\"/> It also stated that Sahara was \"disgusted\" by the unsporting and biased attitude of the BCCI towards it and the Pune franchise despite its supporting of Indian cricket for more than a decade,<ref name=\"pune out\">[http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/637036.html Full text of Pune Warriors' statement]</ref> the decision to withdraw from the IPL was final and it will not return to the IPL even if the entire franchise fee is waived by the BCCI.<ref name=\"pune out\"/> However, it added that Sahara would remain the sponsor of the [[India national cricket team|Indian cricket team]] until December 2013, when its contract with the BCCI expires, following which it asked the BCCI to find a new sponsor for the team.<ref name=\"pune out\"/> Speaking to the media on 24 May 2013, Subrata Roy said that the attitude of BCCI president and [[India Cements]] chairman [[N. Srinivasan]] towards Sahara and the Pune franchise was the main reason for the withdrawal of Sahara from IPL and Indian cricket and also added that Sahara would never be associated with Indian cricket as long as Srinivasan is at the helm of BCCI affairs.<ref>[http://www.financialexpress.com/news/sack-n-srinivasan-or-wont-sponsor-team-india-subrata-roy/1120155 Sack N Srinivasan or won't sponsor Team India: Subrata Roy]</ref>\n\nOn 26 October 2013, the BCCI officially terminated its agreement with the team, bringing an end to the team's IPL sojourn.<ref name=\"goodbye pwi\"/>\n\n==Home ground==\n\n[[File:DY Patil Stadium.jpg|thumb|left|[[DY Patil Stadium]], the initial \"home\" ground of Pune Warriors India]]\n[[File:Sahara Stadium Pune 4.jpg|thumb|right|[[Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium]] at Gahunje, the home ground of Pune Warriors India from 2012\u20132013]]\nIn their inaugural season in 2011, the team played their home matches at the [[DY Patil Stadium]] at [[Navi Mumbai]], as their designated home venue, the [[Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium]], was still under construction. Only from the 2012 season onwards did the team actually begin to play their home matches in Pune at the Subrata Roy Sahara Stadium, named after the Chairman of Sahara India Pariwar. It is located at Gahunje, a village located about {{convert|23|km}} north-west of Pune on the [[Mumbai Pune Expressway]].<ref name=\"gahunje\"/> It has a seating capacity of 55,000 spectators.<ref name=\"stadium\">[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/ipl/venues/Subrata-Roy-Sahara-Stadium-Pune/iplvenueshow.cms Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium, Pune]</ref>\n\nThe stadium became a source of contention between Sahara India Pariwar and the [[Maharashtra Cricket Association]] (MCA). In early 2013, Sahara moved court over the termination of the agreement between it and the MCA over the stadium by the latter. MCA had terminated the agreement on the ground due to Sahara defaulting over payments to the MCA and had renamed the stadium as the MCA Pune International Cricket Centre.<ref>[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-01-08/top-stories/36216126_1_subrata-roy-sahara-stadium-mca-interim-relief Sahara moves court against MCA over stadium in Pune]</ref> Sahara decided to play all their home matches outside Pune till the issue was resolved.<ref name=\"stad\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thatscricket.com/news/2013/03/10/pune-warriors-play-home-games-at-mha-stadium-ipl-6-066409.html |title=Pune Warriors to play home games at MCA Stadium |publisher=That's Cricket |date=10 March 2013 |accessdate=14 January 2015}}</ref> On 15 March 2013, the issue was finally resolved, with Sahara agreeing to pay all existing dues within three months.<ref name=\"resolve\">[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-03-16/news/37766988_1_subrata-roy-sahara-stadium-sahara-chairman-sahara-group Sahara-Maharashtra Cricket Association row settled]</ref> The stadium was renamed back to Subrata Roy Sahara Stadium and MCA also allowed Pune Warriors India to play all its home matches in the stadium.<ref name=\"stad\"/><ref name=\"resolve\"/>\n\n==Team identity==\n\n===Team name and logo===\n\nThe Pune franchise named the team Pune Warriors India in honour of the [[Maratha Empire]] which once ruled from the city.

The jersey also incorporated the attacking warrior logo in the top-left corner of the shirt. From the 2012 season onwards, the primary colour of the jersey was changed to [[Turquoise (color)#Turquoise Blue|turquoise blue]]. [[Adidas]] was the kit manufacturer for the first two seasons, but for the third season, T. K. Sportswear was the kit manufacturer. Indian online fashion clothing brand American Swan was the official lifestyle clothing partner for the team.<ref>[http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/american-swan-is-pune-warriors-clothing-partner/article4653534.ece American Swan is Pune Warriors clothing partner]</ref>\n\n===Sponsors===\nFor their first two seasons, the main sponsor for the team was [[TVS Motors]].<ref>[http://www.telegraphindia.com/external/display.jsp?mode=details&id=26486 Creatigies makes Pune Warriors India Vroom on TVS]</ref> TVS was replaced as the team's main sponsor for their final season by [[Sansui Electric]], a Japanese consumer appliance manufacturer.<ref>[http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-04-08/news/38374174_1_pune-warriors-team-ipl-team-principal-sponsor Sansui becomes principal sponsor of Pune Warriors India]</ref> The other sponsors were [[Lux Cozi]], [[Nissan]], [[UB Group]], Linc Pens, [[Oakley Inc.]], [[YOU Broadband]], Killer Jeans and [[Finolex Group]]. For the 3 seasons of Exide BMW is the main sponsor. BMW will be replaced by Brittania as the main sponsor. The other sponsors are [[Indigo Airlines]], [[Seagrams]], [[Jockey International|Jockey]], [[Newell Rubbermaid|Reynolds]], [[Raymond Group]], [[Titan Company|Fastrack]], [[Airtel]] and Ashirwad Pipes.\n\n===Theme song===\n\nThe team's official theme song was \"Sahara Saharaa\", a [[Hindi]] song sung by leading playback singer and music composer [[Shankar Mahadevan]]. The video of the song showed a warrior riding on a horse and inspiring the Pune residents to come to the stadium where they witnessed the team cricketers. Then the team cricketers as well as the residents performed the Sahara salute (putting the right hand over the heart and saying \"Jai Sahara\").\n\n===Indian cheerleaders===\nPune Warriors India was the only IPL franchise which used Indian [[cheerleading|cheerleaders]] unlike the other franchises which use foreign cheerleaders. Known as ''Cheer Queens'', these cheerleaders were dressed up in traditional Indian attire designed by famous [[Bollywood]] designer [[Neeta Lulla]] and performed traditional Indian dances choreographed by ace choreographers [[Ganesh Hegde]] and [[Tanusree Shankar]], not the traditional gymnastic routines which are usually associated with cheerleading.<ref name=\"cheerleaders\">[http://www.infrawindow.com/weekends/ipl-cheerleaders_10_13/ IPL cheerleaders]</ref> In the words of Subrata Roy-\n\n{{quote|With Pune Warriors India's ''Cheer Queens'', we intend to showcase and bring recognition to the rich and diverse culture of India at an international platform.

The main reason for the withdrawal was due to a problem in the amount of franchise fee to be paid by the Pune team. Sahara insisted that it had bid a huge amount for the Pune franchise under the notion that there would be 94 matches in the 2011 IPL season. As the BCCI later reduced the number of IPL matches to 74, Sahara demanded for a reduction in the amount of franchise fee to be paid by them to maintain viable IPL proposition.<ref name=\"pune out\"/> Other reasons included disputes between Sahara and the BCCI regarding the IPL rules, such as player retention and the 4-foreign player rule and also the refusal on the part of the BCCI to allow Pune to add Yuvraj Singh's price to their auction purse so that they could buy another player as a replacement for Yuvraj. Yuvraj was set to miss the whole [[2012 Indian Premier League|2012 season]] as he was undergoing treatment for [[germ cell tumor|germ cell cancer]].<ref name=\"withdraw\"/> On 6 February 2012, [[Subrata Roy]], the chairman of Sahara India Pariwar, said that Sourav Ganguly will take a call on reconciliation.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.ipl-schedule.net/sourav-ganguly-to-take-call-on-reconciliation-subroto-roy/|title=Sourav Ganguly to take call on reconciliation: Subroto Roy}}</ref> A week later, the BCCI announced that they have allowed Yuvraj Singh's replacement for Pune Warriors India for the 2012 season, though a deadlock still persisted between the two parties on long-term sponsorship.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/et-cetera/bcci-sahara-feud-unresolved-board-refuses-to-make-any-exceptions/articleshow/11872185.cms |title=BCCI-Sahara feud unresolved, Board refuses to make any exceptions \u2013 Economic Times |newspaper=The Economic Times |date=13 February 2012 |publisher=Economictimes.indiatimes.com |accessdate=12 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 February 2012, the BCCI and Sahara ended their differences and announced that Pune Warriors India will play in IPL 5.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pune Warriors India to play in IPL 5|date=4 February 2012|url=http://www.ipl-schedule.net/pune-warriors-india-to-play-in-ipl-5/}}</ref> The BCCI agreed to give Sahara a total purse of $3.4 million, $1.6 million from the money that they had for the auction and $1.8 million as compensation due to the absence of Yuvraj. It was also decided that Pune could replace Yuvraj with one player, whose fees would be up to $1.8 million. IPL's trading window was extended up to 29 February 2012 to allow the team to purchase players. Pune was also allowed the compensation of playing 5 foreign players in the squad, subject to the consent of the other 8 franchises. The BCCI also allowed Sahara to have a strategic partner in the franchise. Pune's new stadium would be allowed to host one of the play-off matches, provided [[Royal Challengers Bangalore]] gave consent, because according to a BCCI rule, the right to host the play-off matches is given to the finalist of the previous edition. (RCB were the runners-up in the previous tournament).<ref>{{cite news|title=Sahara stays sponsor, Pune will play IPL|newspaper=The Times of India}}</ref> BCCI agreed to negotiate with Sahara regarding the amount of franchise fee to be paid and also agreed to start arbitration proceedings for the same.<ref name=\"pune out\"/>\n\n===2012 season===\n[[File:PWI VS DD.jpg|thumb|right|Pune Warriors India in action against [[Delhi Daredevils]] at the [[Subrata Roy Sahara Stadium]]]]\n{{Main|2012 Indian Premier League}}\nThough Pune boycotted the IPL auction, they signed international cricketers outside the auction including [[Marlon Samuels]], [[Luke Wright]], [[Steve Smith (cricketer)|Steve Smith]], [[Tamim Iqbal]], [[James Hopes]] and [[Michael Clarke (cricketer)|Michael Clarke]].

But just like in 2011, the team could not maintain the initial momentum and again won only two more matches that season, against defending champions [[Chennai Super Kings]] at home and Delhi Daredevils away. Midway through the season, Ganguly was sacked as captain and was dropped from the team due to lack of results, but was retained as mentor.<ref name=\"dada\"/> However, this decision was later reversed and he returned to the team as captain. For the home match against Royal Challengers Bangalore, Ganguly rested himself, with Steve Smith taking up the captaincy, but still, the team lost by 35 runs. Pune finished last that season with 4 wins and 12 losses in 16 matches.\n\n===2013 season===\n{{Main|2013 Indian Premier League}}\nFor the 2013 season, Pune Warriors India retained Steve Smith, Tamim Iqbal, Marlon Samuels and Luke Wright but released Clarke, James Hopes, Callum Ferguson, Alfonso Thomas, Murali Kartik and Jesse Ryder. Ganguly announced his retirement from all forms of cricket in October 2012,<ref name=\"bye dada\">[http://www.dnaindia.com/sport/1757445/report-sourav-ganguly-quits-ipl-retires-from-all-forms-of-cricket Ganguly retires]</ref> leaving the franchise without a captain.

The franchise also swapped a player with the Delhi Daredevils, trading Nehra for [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] batsman [[Ross Taylor]].<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2013/content/story/604641.html Delhi swap Taylor for Pune's Nehra]</ref> Yuvraj also returned to the team following his recovery from cancer. Unfortunately for the franchise, Clarke, who was the frontrunner to lead the team, was ruled out of the entire season with a recurring back and hamstring injury, which was aggravated during the [[Australian cricket team in India in 2012\u201313|Australian tour of India]] held earlier.<ref>[http://sports.ndtv.com/indian-premier-league-2013/news/205416-michael-clarke-out-for-10-weeks-pune-warriors-have-to-hunt-for-new-captain Michael Clarke ruled out of IPL 6, Pune Warriors have to hunt for new captain]</ref> On 28 March 2013, the franchise named Sri Lankan Test and ODI captain and all-rounder Angelo Mathews as the captain for the 2013 season<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2013/content/story/627151.html Angelo Mathews named Pune Warriors' captain]</ref> and also signed Australian batsman [[Aaron Finch]] as a replacement for Clarke.<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/ipl-pune/content/story/627230.html Finch to replace Clarke for Pune Warriors]</ref>\n\nThe team's performance in the 2013 season was pathetic and mirrored its performance in 2012 with 4 wins and 12 losses in 16 matches, finishing 8th and second-last in the league. The only matches the team won were against [[Rajasthan Royals]] (home), Chennai Super Kings (away), Kolkata Knight Riders (away) and Delhi Daredevils (home). The Warriors were thoroughly humiliated in their away match against Royal Challengers Bangalore, courtesy [[Chris Gayle]]'s 175 not out off only 66 balls and later became the first team in the 2013 season to be knocked out of contention for the playoffs after a loss to Chennai Super Kings at home. Like the previous seasons, the main cause for the team's poor performance was their constant squandering of winning chances and the lack of balance in the side, with more than 30 players being used during the season. The team was the only IPL franchise to use three captains that season. Mathews was sacked as captain following a poor start by the Warriors in the tournament and his own poor form and was replaced by Taylor for the away match against Chennai Super Kings. Following this match, Taylor was also sacked as captain due to his poor form, in spite of the team winning in Chennai, and was replaced by Finch, who captained the Warriors for the rest of the season.\n\n===Second and final withdrawal from IPL===\nOn 21 May 2013, just two days after finishing its league campaign, Sahara withdrew Pune Warriors India from the IPL for the second time in three years.<ref name=\"pullout\"/> The reason, according to BCCI, was the encashing of the team's bank guarantee after Sahara defaulted on paying the entire franchise fee.<ref name=\"pullout\"/> BCCI sources said that Sahara paid 20% of the franchise fee in January 2013 and had promised to pay the remaining amount by 19 May 2013 but they failed to do so.<ref name=\"pune gone\">[http://sports.ndtv.com/indian-premier-league-2013/news/208101-ipl-6-bcci-encashes-bank-guarantee-after-pune-warriors-fail-to-pay-franchisee-fee BCCI encashes bank guarantee after Pune Warriors fail to pay franchisee fee]</ref> But Sahara blamed BCCI for the decision to pull out the Pune franchise from the IPL.

Only from the 2012 season onwards did the team actually begin to play their home matches in Pune at the Subrata Roy Sahara Stadium, named after the Chairman of Sahara India Pariwar.

A recent historical analysis has demonstrated that the rate of [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] improvements has generally been outpaced by the rate of growth in energy demand, which is due to continuing economic and [[population growth]]. As a result, despite energy efficiency gains, total energy use and related carbon emissions have continued to increase.

Worldwide, nearly a billion people lack [[Electrification|access to electricity]], and around 3 billion people rely on smoky fuels such as wood, charcoal or animal dung in order to cook. These and [[Fossil fuel|fossil fuels]] are a major contributor to [[air pollution]], which causes an estimated 7 million deaths per year.

However, particular renewable energy projects, such as the clearing of forests for the production of [[biofuel]]s, can lead to similar or even worse environmental damage when compared to using fossil fuel energy.

A recent historical analysis has demonstrated that the rate of [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] improvements has generally been outpaced by the rate of growth in energy demand, which is due to continuing economic and [[population growth]]. As a result, despite energy efficiency gains, total energy use and related carbon emissions have continued to increase.

Brady returned alone after about 30 minutes, and took Hindley to the spot where Reade lay dying; Reade's clothes were in disarray and she had been nearly decapitated{{sfnp|Lee|2010|pp=114\u201316|ps=none}} by two cuts to the throat, including a four-inch incision across her voice box \"inflicted with considerable force\" and into which the collar of her coat and a throat chain had been pushed.<ref>{{citation|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&dat=19880413&id=vThAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=N1kMAAAAIBAJ&pg=4902,3144112|title=Coroner commends police after Moors verdict|work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] \u2013 Google News Archive Search|date=13 April 1988|access-date=17 October 2016}}</ref>  When Hindley asked Brady whether he had raped Reade, Brady replied, \"Of course I did.\"  Hindley stayed with Reade while Brady retrieved a spade he had hidden nearby on a previous visit, then returned to the van while Brady buried Reade.

Once Kilbride was inside Hindley's hired [[Ford Anglia]] car, Brady said they would have to make a detour to their home for the sherry.  En route he suggested another detour, this time to search for a glove Hindley had lost on the moor.{{sfnp|Lee|2010|pp=130\u2013135|ps=none}}  When they reached the moor Brady took Kilbride with him while Hindley waited in the car; Brady sexually assaulted Kilbride and tried to slit his throat with a six-inch serrated blade before strangling him with a shoelace or string.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=90\u201392|ps=none}}\n\n===Keith Bennett===\n[[File:Keith bennett.jpg|right|upright=0.55|thumb|alt=Head and shoulders monochrome photograph of a smiling short-haired young boy wearing spectacles.|Keith Bennett]]\n\nEarly in the evening of 16 June 1964, Hindley asked twelve-year-old Keith Bennett, who was on his way to his grandmother's house in [[Longsight]], Manchester,{{sfnp|Lee|2010|pp=144\u2013146|ps=none}} for help in loading some boxes into her [[Mini#Variants|Mini Pick-up]], after which she said she would drive him home.  Brady was in the back of the van.  She drove to a [[rest area#United Kingdom|lay-by]] on Saddleworth Moor and Brady went off with Bennett, supposedly looking for a lost glove.  After about 30&nbsp;minutes Brady returned alone, carrying a spade that he had hidden there earlier, and, in response to Hindley's questions, said that he had sexually assaulted Bennett and strangled him with a piece of string.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=95\u201396|ps=none}}\n\n===Lesley Ann Downey===\nBrady and Hindley visited a fairground on 26 December 1964 and noticed that 10-year-old Lesley Ann Downey was apparently alone.  They approached her and deliberately dropped some shopping they were carrying, then asked her help in taking the packages to their car, and then to their home.  At the house Downey was undressed, gagged, and forced to pose for photographs before being raped and killed, perhaps strangled with a piece of string.  Hindley later maintained that she went to fill a bath for Downey and found her dead when she returned; Brady claimed that Hindley killed Downey.  The following morning Brady and Hindley drove Downey's body to Saddleworth Moor,{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=106|ps=none}} and buried her{{mdashb}}naked with her clothes at her feet{{mdashb}}in a shallow grave.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=34|ps=none}}\n\n===Edward Evans===\n[[File:16 wardle brook avenue.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A roadside view of several 20th-century British houses.

After a few minutes Brady reappeared in the company of 17-year-old Edward Evans, an apprentice engineer who lived in [[Ardwick]], to whom he introduced Hindley as his sister.  They drove to Brady and Hindley's home at 16 Wardle Brook Avenue, [[Hattersley]], [[Cheshire]], where they relaxed over a bottle of wine.\n\nAt some point Brady sent Hindley to fetch David Smith, the husband of Hindley's younger sister Maureen.{{sfnp|Staff|2007|pp=184\u2013186|ps=none}} The Hindley family had not approved of Maureen's marriage to Smith, who had several criminal convictions, including [[Assault occasioning actual bodily harm|actual bodily harm]] and housebreaking, the first of which, wounding with intent, occurred when he was 11.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=22|ps=none}}  Throughout the previous year Brady had been cultivating a friendship with Smith, who had become \"in awe\" of Brady, something that increasingly worried Hindley, as she felt it compromised their safety.{{sfnp|Staff|2007|pp=183\u2013184|ps=none}}\n\nHindley returned with Smith and told him to wait outside for her signal, a flashing light.  When the signal came, Smith knocked on the door and was met by Brady, who asked if he had come for \"the miniature wine bottles\",{{sfnp|Staff|2007|pp=184\u2013186|ps=none}} and left him in the kitchen saying that he was going to collect the wine.  Smith later told the police:\n\n{{Quote| I waited about a minute or two then suddenly I heard a hell of a scream; it sounded like a woman, really high-pitched.

He was lying with his head and shoulders on the couch and his legs were on the floor.  He was facing upwards.  Ian was standing over him, facing him, with his legs on either side of the young lad's legs.  The lad was still screaming&nbsp;...

Wearing a bread deliveryman's overall on top of his uniform, he asked Myra Hindley at the back door if her husband was home. When she denied that she had a husband or that a man was in the house, Talbot identified himself. Hindley led him into the living room, where Brady was lying on a divan, writing to his employer about his ankle injury.{{sfnp|Benfield|1968|p=151}} Talbot explained that he was investigating \"an act of violence involving guns\" that was reported to have taken place the previous evening.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=120\u2013121|ps=none}}\n\nHindley denied there had been any violence, and allowed police to look around the house.  When police asked for the key to the locked spare bedroom, Hindley said it was at her workplace; but after police offered to take her to retrieve it, Brady told her to hand it over.  When police returned to the living room they arrested Brady on suspicion of murder.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=120\u2013121|ps=none}}  As Brady was getting dressed, he said \"Eddie and I had a row and the situation got out of hand.\"{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|p=85|ps=none}}\n\n==Initial investigation==\nThough Hindley was not initially arrested, she demanded to go with Brady to the police station, taking her dog.{{sfnp|Staff|2007|pp=193\u2013194|ps=none}}  She refused to make any statement about Evans's death beyond claiming it had been an accident, and was allowed to go home on the condition that she return the next day.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=122\u2013124|ps=none}} Over the next four days Hindley visited her employer and asked to be dismissed so that she would be eligible for [[unemployment benefits]].  On one of these occasions, Hindley found an envelope belonging to Brady which she burned in an ashtray; she claimed she did not open it but believed it contained plans for bank robberies. On 11 October, she too was arrested and taken into custody, being charged as an [[Accessory (legal term)|accessory]] to the murder of Edward Evans and was remanded at [[Risley (HM Prison)|Risley]].{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=122\u2013124|ps=none}}\n\nPolice searching the house at Wardle Brook Avenue found an old exercise book with the name \"John Kilbride\", which made them suspect that Brady and Hindley had been involved in the disappearances of other youngsters.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=33|ps=none}} Brady told police that he and Evans had fought, but insisted that he and Smith had murdered Evans and that Hindley had \"only done what she had been told\".{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=122|ps=none}} Smith said that Brady had asked him to return anything incriminating, such as \"dodgy books\", which Brady then packed into suitcases; he had no idea what else the suitcases contained or where they might be, though he mentioned that Brady \"had a thing about railway stations\".

In the letter, Johnson was sympathetic to Hindley over the criticism surrounding her first visit. Hindley, who had not replied to the first letter, responded by thanking Johnson for both letters, explaining that her decision not to reply to the first resulted from the negative publicity that surrounded it. She claimed that, had Johnson written to her 14&nbsp;years earlier, she would have confessed and helped the police. She also paid tribute to Topping, and thanked Johnson for her sincerity.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=268\u2013269|ps=none}}  Hindley made her second visit to the moor in March 1987. This time, the level of security surrounding her visit was considerably higher. She stayed overnight in Manchester, at the flat of the police chief in charge of GMP training at [[Sedgley Park, Greater Manchester|Sedgley Park, Prestwich]], and visited the moor twice.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|p=269|ps=none}} She confirmed to police that the two areas in which they were concentrating their search\u2014Hollin Brown Knoll and Hoe Grain\u2014were correct, although she was unable to locate either of the graves.

Amidst strong media interest [[Lord Longford]] pleaded for her release, writing that continuing her detention to satisfy \"mob emotion\" was not right. Fisher persuaded Hindley to release a public statement, which touched on her reasons for denying her guilt previously, her religious experiences in prison, and the letter from Johnson.

Brady took their name, and became known as Ian Sloan. His mother continued to visit him throughout his childhood.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=17\u201319|ps=none}}  Various authors have stated that he [[zoosadism|tortured animals]], although Brady objected to such accusations.{{sfnp|Cowley|2011|p=28|ps=none}}  Aged nine, he visited [[Loch Lomond]] with his family, where he reportedly discovered an affinity for the outdoors, and a few months later the family moved to a new [[council house]] on an [[overspill estate]] at [[Pollok]].  He was accepted for [[Shawlands Academy]], a school for above-average pupils.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=19\u201320|ps=none}}\n\nAt Shawlands his behaviour worsened; as a teenager he twice appeared before a juvenile court for housebreaking. He left the academy aged 15, and took a job as a tea boy at a [[Harland and Wolff]] shipyard in [[Govan]]. Nine months later, he began working as a butcher's messenger boy. He had a girlfriend, Evelyn Grant, but their relationship ended when he threatened her with a [[flick knife]] after she visited a dance with another boy. He again appeared before the court, this time with nine charges against him,{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=20\u201321|ps=none}} and shortly before his 17th birthday he was placed on probation, on condition that he live with his mother.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=24|ps=none}} By then, she had moved to Manchester and married an Irish fruit merchant named Patrick Brady; Patrick Brady got Ian a job as a fruit porter at Smithfield Market, and Ian took Patrick Brady's surname.{{sfnp|Staff|2007|p=122|ps=none}}\n\nWithin a year of moving to Manchester, Brady was caught with a sack full of lead seals he had stolen and was trying to smuggle out of the market.

The family house was in a poor condition and Hindley was forced to sleep in a single bed next to her parents' double.  Their living situation deteriorated further when Hindley's sister, Maureen, was born in August 1946, and about a year later Hindley, then 5, was sent to live with a grandmother nearby.{{sfnp|Staff|2007|pp=39\u201346|ps=none}}\n\nHindley's father had served with the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]] and had been stationed in North Africa, Cyprus and Italy during the [[Second World War]].{{sfnp|Staff|2007|p=38|ps=none}}  He had been known in the army as a \"hard man\" and he expected his daughter to be equally tough; he taught her to fight and insisted that she \"stick up for herself\".

A few months later, she asked her friend to destroy the letter.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|p=32|ps=none}} In her 30,000-word plea for parole, written in 1978 and 1979 and submitted to Home Secretary [[Merlyn Rees]], Hindley said:{{quote|Within months he [Brady] had convinced me that there was no God at all: he could have told me that the earth was flat, the moon was made of green cheese and the sun rose in the west, I would have believed him, such was his power of persuasion.{{sfnp|Carmichael|2003|p=6|ps=none}}}}\n\nHindley began to change her appearance further, wearing clothing considered risqu\u00e9 such as high boots, short skirts and leather jackets, and the two became less sociable to their colleagues.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=32\u201333|ps=none}} The couple were regulars at the library, borrowing books on [[philosophy]], as well as crime and torture.{{sfnp|Lee|2010|p=93}} They also read works by the [[Marquis de Sade]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]{{sfnp|Lee|2010|p=93}} and [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]'s ''[[Crime and Punishment]]''.<ref name=HindleyODNB/>{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|p=35|ps=none}}{{efn|Brady told the police 30 years later that everything he had ever done was in ''Crime and Punishment''.{{sfnp|Lee|2010|p=89}}  Brady also claimed that Dostoevsky and Nietzsche were his biggest influences.{{sfnp|Keightley|2017|p=36}}}}  Although Hindley was not a qualified driver (she passed her test on 7 November 1963 after failing three times),{{sfnp|Lee|2010|p=126}} she often hired a van, in which the couple planned bank robberies. Hindley befriended George Clitheroe, the President of the Cheadle Rifle Club, and on several occasions visited two local shooting ranges. Clitheroe, although puzzled by her interest, arranged for her to buy a .22 rifle from a gun merchant in Manchester. She also asked to join a pistol club, but she was a poor shot and allegedly often bad-tempered, so Clitheroe told her that she was unsuitable; she did though manage to purchase a [[Webley & Scott|Webley]] .45 and a [[Smith & Wesson]] .38 from other members of the club.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=37\u201340|ps=none}} Brady and Hindley's plans for robbery came to nothing, but they became interested in photography. Brady already owned a [[Brownie (camera)|Box Brownie]], which he used to take photographs of Hindley and her dog, Puppet, but he upgraded to a more sophisticated model, and also purchased lights and [[darkroom]] equipment. The pair took photographs of each other that, for the time, would have been considered explicit.

The story tells a fictionalised account of the [[Leopold and Loeb]] case, two young men from well-to-do families who attempt to commit the perfect murder of a 12-year-old boy, and escape the [[death penalty]] because of their age.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=80|ps=none}}\n\nBy June 1963, Brady had moved in with Hindley at her grandmother's house in Bannock Street, and on 12 July 1963, the two murdered their first victim, Reade, who had attended school with Hindley's younger sister, Maureen, and had also been in a short relationship with David Smith, a local boy with three criminal convictions for minor crimes.  Police found no one who had seen Reade before her disappearance, and although the 15-year-old Smith was questioned by police, he was cleared of any involvement in her death.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=41\u201345|ps=none}}  Their next victim, Kilbride, was killed on 23 November 1963.  A huge search was undertaken, with over 700&nbsp;statements taken, and 500&nbsp;\"missing\" posters printed.  Eight days after he failed to return home, 2,000&nbsp;volunteers scoured waste ground and derelict buildings.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=46\u201347|ps=none}}\n\nHindley hired a vehicle a week after Kilbride went missing, and again on 21 December 1963, apparently to make sure the burial sites had not been disturbed.  In February 1964, she bought a second-hand [[Austin Motor Company|Austin Traveller]], but soon after traded it for a [[Mini]] van.  Bennett disappeared on 16 June 1964.  His stepfather, Jimmy Johnson, became a suspect; in the two years following Bennett's disappearance, Johnson was taken for questioning on four occasions.  Detectives searched under the floorboards of the Johnsons' house, and on discovering that the houses in the row were connected, extended the search to the entire street.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=50\u201355|ps=none}}\n\n[[File:David and maureen smith nee hindley.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A young man and woman, in 1960s fashion, stand for a monochrome photograph.

The newlyweds moved into Smith's father's house.  The next day, Brady suggested that the four take a day-trip to [[Windermere]].  This was the first time Brady and Smith had met properly, and Brady was apparently impressed by Smith's demeanour.  The two talked about society, the distribution of wealth, and the possibility of robbing a bank.  The young Smith was similarly impressed by Brady, who throughout the day had paid for his food and wine.  The trip to the Lake District was the first of many outings.  Hindley was apparently jealous of their relationship, but became closer to her sister.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=56\u201358|ps=none}}\n\nIn 1964, Hindley, her grandmother, and Brady were rehoused as part of the post-war slum clearances in Manchester, to 16&nbsp;Wardle Brook Avenue in the new overspill estate of Hattersley.  Brady and Hindley became friendly with Patricia Hodges, an 11-year-old girl who lived at 12&nbsp;Wardle Brook Avenue.  Hodges accompanied the two on their trips to [[Saddleworth Moor]] to collect [[peat]], something that many householders on the new estate did to improve the soil in their gardens, which were full of clay and builder's rubble.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=137|ps=none}}  She remained unharmed; living only a few doors away, her disappearance would have been easily solved.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=62\u201365|ps=none}}\n\nEarly on [[Boxing Day]] 1964, Hindley left her grandmother at a relative's house and refused to allow her back to Wardle Brook Avenue that night.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|p=65|ps=none}}  On the same day, Downey disappeared from a [[funfair]] in [[Ancoats]].{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|p=67|ps=none}}  Despite a huge search, she was not found.

The victims were five children\u2014Pauline Reade, John Kilbride, Keith Bennett, Lesley Ann Downey and Edward Evans\u2014aged between 10 and 17, at least four of whom were [[Sexual assault|sexually assaulted]].  Two of the victims were discovered in graves dug on [[Saddleworth Moor]]; a third grave was discovered there in 1987, more than twenty years after Brady and Hindley's trial.  Bennett's body is also thought to be buried there, but despite repeated searches it remains undiscovered.\n\nThe pair were charged only in the deaths of Kilbride, Downey and Evans, and received life sentences.  The investigation was reopened in 1985, after Brady was reported as having confessed to the murders of Reade and Bennett.  After confessing to these additional murders, Brady and Hindley were taken separately to Saddleworth Moor to assist in the search for the graves.\n\nCharacterised by the press as \"the most evil woman in Britain\",<ref>{{cite news|title=Hindley: I wish I'd been hanged|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/661139.stm|work=[[BBC News]]|date=29 February 2000 |access-date=11 August 2009}}</ref>  Hindley made several appeals against her life sentence, claiming she was a reformed woman and no longer a danger to society, but was never released.  She died in 2002, aged 60.  Brady was diagnosed as a [[Psychopathy|psychopath]] in 1985 and confined in the high-security [[Ashworth Hospital]].  He made it clear that he never wished to be released, and repeatedly asked to be allowed to die.  He died in 2017, at Ashworth, aged 79.\n\nThe murders were the result of what Malcolm MacCulloch, professor of [[forensic psychiatry]] at [[Cardiff University]], called a \"concatenation of circumstances\".{{sfnp|Staff|2007|p=294|ps=none}}  The trial judge, Mr Justice [[Fenton Atkinson]], described Brady and Hindley in his closing remarks as \"two sadistic killers of the utmost depravity\".{{sfnp|Carmichael|2003|p=2|ps=none}} Their crimes were the subject of extensive worldwide media coverage.\n\n==Murders==\n[[File:Yeoman hey and dovestones from hollin brown knoll.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Saddleworth Moor]], viewed from Hollin Brown Knoll.  The bodies of three of the victims were found in this area.|alt=Rolling hills covered in grass]]\n\n===Pauline Reade===\n\nOn 12 July 1963, Brady told Hindley that he wanted to commit a \"perfect murder\".  After work he instructed her to drive a borrowed van around while he followed on his motorcycle; when he spotted a likely victim he would flash his headlight.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=82\u201385|ps=none}}\n\nDriving down Gorton Lane, Brady saw a young girl and signalled Hindley, who did not stop because she recognised the girl as an 8-year-old neighbour of her mother.{{sfnp|Lee|2010|pp=112|ps=none}}  Sometime after 7:30 pm,{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|p=43|ps=none}} on Froxmer Street, Brady signalled Hindley to stop for 16-year-old Pauline Reade, a schoolmate of Myra's sister Maureen on her way to a dance; Hindley offered Reade a lift.  At various times Hindley gave conflicting statements about the extent to which she, versus Brady, was responsible for Reade being selected as their first victim,{{sfnp|Lee|2010|pp=110\u201313|ps=none}} but said she felt that there would be less attention given to the disappearance of a teenager than to a missing 8-year-old.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=83|ps=none}}\n\nOnce Reade was in the van, Hindley asked her help in searching Saddleworth Moor for an expensive lost glove; Reade agreed and they drove there.  When Brady arrived on his motorcycle, Hindley told Reade he would be helping in the search.  Hindley later claimed that she waited in the van while Brady took Reade onto the moor.  Brady returned alone after about 30 minutes, and took Hindley to the spot where Reade lay dying; Reade's clothes were in disarray and she had been nearly decapitated{{sfnp|Lee|2010|pp=114\u201316|ps=none}} by two cuts to the throat, including a four-inch incision across her voice box \"inflicted with considerable force\" and into which the collar of her coat and a throat chain had been pushed.<ref>{{citation|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&dat=19880413&id=vThAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=N1kMAAAAIBAJ&pg=4902,3144112|title=Coroner commends police after Moors verdict|work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] \u2013 Google News Archive Search|date=13 April 1988|access-date=17 October 2016}}</ref>  When Hindley asked Brady whether he had raped Reade, Brady replied, \"Of course I did.\"  Hindley stayed with Reade while Brady retrieved a spade he had hidden nearby on a previous visit, then returned to the van while Brady buried Reade.  In Brady's account, Hindley was not only present for the attack, but participated in the sexual assault.{{sfnp|Lee|2010|p=115\u201316|ps=none}}\n\n===John Kilbride===\nIn the early evening of 23 November 1963, at a market in [[Ashton-under-Lyne]], Brady and Hindley offered 12-year-old John Kilbride a lift home, saying his parents might worry that he was out so late; they also promised him a bottle of sherry.  Once Kilbride was inside Hindley's hired [[Ford Anglia]] car, Brady said they would have to make a detour to their home for the sherry.  En route he suggested another detour, this time to search for a glove Hindley had lost on the moor.{{sfnp|Lee|2010|pp=130\u2013135|ps=none}}  When they reached the moor Brady took Kilbride with him while Hindley waited in the car; Brady sexually assaulted Kilbride and tried to slit his throat with a six-inch serrated blade before strangling him with a shoelace or string.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=90\u201392|ps=none}}\n\n===Keith Bennett===\n[[File:Keith bennett.jpg|right|upright=0.55|thumb|alt=Head and shoulders monochrome photograph of a smiling short-haired young boy wearing spectacles.|Keith Bennett]]\n\nEarly in the evening of 16 June 1964, Hindley asked twelve-year-old Keith Bennett, who was on his way to his grandmother's house in [[Longsight]], Manchester,{{sfnp|Lee|2010|pp=144\u2013146|ps=none}} for help in loading some boxes into her [[Mini#Variants|Mini Pick-up]], after which she said she would drive him home.  Brady was in the back of the van.  She drove to a [[rest area#United Kingdom|lay-by]] on Saddleworth Moor and Brady went off with Bennett, supposedly looking for a lost glove.  After about 30&nbsp;minutes Brady returned alone, carrying a spade that he had hidden there earlier, and, in response to Hindley's questions, said that he had sexually assaulted Bennett and strangled him with a piece of string.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=95\u201396|ps=none}}\n\n===Lesley Ann Downey===\nBrady and Hindley visited a fairground on 26 December 1964 and noticed that 10-year-old Lesley Ann Downey was apparently alone.  They approached her and deliberately dropped some shopping they were carrying, then asked her help in taking the packages to their car, and then to their home.  At the house Downey was undressed, gagged, and forced to pose for photographs before being raped and killed, perhaps strangled with a piece of string.  Hindley later maintained that she went to fill a bath for Downey and found her dead when she returned; Brady claimed that Hindley killed Downey.  The following morning Brady and Hindley drove Downey's body to Saddleworth Moor,{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=106|ps=none}} and buried her{{mdashb}}naked with her clothes at her feet{{mdashb}}in a shallow grave.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=34|ps=none}}\n\n===Edward Evans===\n[[File:16 wardle brook avenue.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A roadside view of several 20th-century British houses.

A gap in the centre of the image indicates the absence of a single house|The empty plot where 16 Wardle Brook Avenue in [[Hattersley]] once stood.  Manchester City Council decided in 1987 to demolish the house.]]\n\nOn the evening of 6 October 1965, Hindley drove Brady to [[Manchester Central railway station]], where she waited outside in the car whilst he selected a victim.  After a few minutes Brady reappeared in the company of 17-year-old Edward Evans, an apprentice engineer who lived in [[Ardwick]], to whom he introduced Hindley as his sister.  They drove to Brady and Hindley's home at 16 Wardle Brook Avenue, [[Hattersley]], [[Cheshire]], where they relaxed over a bottle of wine.\n\nAt some point Brady sent Hindley to fetch David Smith, the husband of Hindley's younger sister Maureen.{{sfnp|Staff|2007|pp=184\u2013186|ps=none}} The Hindley family had not approved of Maureen's marriage to Smith, who had several criminal convictions, including [[Assault occasioning actual bodily harm|actual bodily harm]] and housebreaking, the first of which, wounding with intent, occurred when he was 11.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=22|ps=none}}  Throughout the previous year Brady had been cultivating a friendship with Smith, who had become \"in awe\" of Brady, something that increasingly worried Hindley, as she felt it compromised their safety.{{sfnp|Staff|2007|pp=183\u2013184|ps=none}}\n\nHindley returned with Smith and told him to wait outside for her signal, a flashing light.  When the signal came, Smith knocked on the door and was met by Brady, who asked if he had come for \"the miniature wine bottles\",{{sfnp|Staff|2007|pp=184\u2013186|ps=none}} and left him in the kitchen saying that he was going to collect the wine.  Smith later told the police:\n\n{{Quote| I waited about a minute or two then suddenly I heard a hell of a scream; it sounded like a woman, really high-pitched.  Then the screams carried on, one after another really loud.  Then I heard Myra shout, \"Dave, help him,\" very loud.  When I ran in I just stood inside the living room and I saw a young lad.  He was lying with his head and shoulders on the couch and his legs were on the floor.  He was facing upwards.  Ian was standing over him, facing him, with his legs on either side of the young lad's legs.  The lad was still screaming&nbsp;... Ian had a hatchet in his hand&nbsp;... he was holding it above his head and he hit the lad on the left side of his head with the hatchet. I heard the blow, it was a terrible hard blow, it sounded horrible.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|p=78|ps=none}}}}\n\nSmith then watched Brady throttle Evans with a length of electrical cord.{{sfnp|Williams|1992|p=266|ps=none}}  Brady sprained his ankle in the struggle, and Evans's body was too heavy for Smith to carry to the car on his own, so they wrapped it in plastic sheeting and put it in the spare bedroom.{{sfnp|Staff|2007|p=186|ps=none}}\n\n==Arrest==\nSmith agreed to return the following morning with his baby\u2019s [[baby transport|pram]], for use in transporting Evans\u2019s body to the car before disposing of it on the moors. He arrived home around 3{{nbsp}}am and asked his wife to make a cup of tea, which he drank before vomiting and telling her what he had witnessed. At 6:10{{nbsp}}am, having waited for daylight and armed himself with a screwdriver and bread knife{{snd}}in case Brady was planning to intercept him{{snd}}Smith called police from a [[phone booth]] on the estate. He was picked up by a police car from the booth and taken to Hyde police station, where he told officers what he had witnessed in the night.{{sfnp|Benfield|1968|pp=150\u20131|ps=none}}\n\nSuperintendent Bob Talbot of the [[Stalybridge]] police division went to 16&nbsp;Wardle Brook Avenue, accompanied by a detective sergeant. Wearing a bread deliveryman's overall on top of his uniform, he asked Myra Hindley at the back door if her husband was home. When she denied that she had a husband or that a man was in the house, Talbot identified himself. Hindley led him into the living room, where Brady was lying on a divan, writing to his employer about his ankle injury.{{sfnp|Benfield|1968|p=151}} Talbot explained that he was investigating \"an act of violence involving guns\" that was reported to have taken place the previous evening.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=120\u2013121|ps=none}}\n\nHindley denied there had been any violence, and allowed police to look around the house.  When police asked for the key to the locked spare bedroom, Hindley said it was at her workplace; but after police offered to take her to retrieve it, Brady told her to hand it over.  When police returned to the living room they arrested Brady on suspicion of murder.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=120\u2013121|ps=none}}  As Brady was getting dressed, he said \"Eddie and I had a row and the situation got out of hand.\"{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|p=85|ps=none}}\n\n==Initial investigation==\nThough Hindley was not initially arrested, she demanded to go with Brady to the police station, taking her dog.{{sfnp|Staff|2007|pp=193\u2013194|ps=none}}  She refused to make any statement about Evans's death beyond claiming it had been an accident, and was allowed to go home on the condition that she return the next day.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=122\u2013124|ps=none}} Over the next four days Hindley visited her employer and asked to be dismissed so that she would be eligible for [[unemployment benefits]].  On one of these occasions, Hindley found an envelope belonging to Brady which she burned in an ashtray; she claimed she did not open it but believed it contained plans for bank robberies. On 11 October, she too was arrested and taken into custody, being charged as an [[Accessory (legal term)|accessory]] to the murder of Edward Evans and was remanded at [[Risley (HM Prison)|Risley]].{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=122\u2013124|ps=none}}\n\nPolice searching the house at Wardle Brook Avenue found an old exercise book with the name \"John Kilbride\", which made them suspect that Brady and Hindley had been involved in the disappearances of other youngsters.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=33|ps=none}} Brady told police that he and Evans had fought, but insisted that he and Smith had murdered Evans and that Hindley had \"only done what she had been told\".{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=122|ps=none}} Smith said that Brady had asked him to return anything incriminating, such as \"dodgy books\", which Brady then packed into suitcases; he had no idea what else the suitcases contained or where they might be, though he mentioned that Brady \"had a thing about railway stations\". A search of left-luggage offices turned up the suitcases at [[Manchester Central railway station]] on 15 October;{{sfnp|Lee|2010|pp=234\u2013235|ps=none}} the claim ticket was later found in Hindley's prayer book.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=107|ps=none}}\n\nInside one of the cases were\u2014among an assortment of costumes, notes, photographs and negatives\u2014nine pornographic photographs taken of Lesley Ann Downey, naked and with a scarf tied across her mouth, and a 16-minute audiotape recording of a girl screaming and pleading for help.{{sfnp|Goodman|1973|p=28|ps=none}}{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=35|ps=none}} Downey's mother later confirmed that the recording, too, was of her daughter.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=35\u201336|ps=none}}\n\nOfficers making inquiries at neighbouring houses spoke to 12-year-old Pat Hodges, who had on several occasions been taken to [[Saddleworth Moor]] by Brady and Hindley, and was able to point out their favourite sites along the [[A635 road]].{{sfnp|Goodman|1973|p=27|ps=none}} Police immediately began to search the area, and on 16 October found an arm bone protruding from the peat, which was presumed at first to be Kilbride's, but which the next day was identified as that of Lesley Ann Downey, whose body was still visually identifiable; her mother was able to identify the clothing which had also been buried in the grave.<ref name=\"Times ears covered\">{{citation |title=Two women at 'bodies on moors' trial cover their ears |newspaper=[[The Times]] |url=https://gdc.gale.com/gdc/artemis/NewspapersDetailsPage/NewspapersDetailsWindow?documentId=GALE%7CCS151743131 |publisher=Times Digital Archive |date=27 April 1966 |page=9 |issue=56616 |access-date=12 September 2019}} {{subscription required}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Myra at John Kilbride's grave.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|alt=A crouched blonde woman in thick jacket, trousers, and boots, holding a small dog.|In this photograph taken by Brady in November 1963, Hindley crouches over John Kilbride's grave on Saddleworth Moor with her dog, Puppet.]]\n\nAlso among the photographs in the suitcase were a number of scenes of the moors. Smith had told police that Brady had boasted of \"photographic proof\" of multiple murders, and officers, struck by Brady's decision to remove the apparently innocent landscapes from the house, appealed to locals for assistance finding locations to match the photographs.

He was regarded by his colleagues as a quiet, punctual, but short-tempered young man. He read books including ''Teach Yourself German'' and ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', as well as works on [[Nazi]] atrocities.

Her parents, Nellie and Bob Hindley (the latter an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]]), beat her regularly when she was a young child.  The family house was in a poor condition and Hindley was forced to sleep in a single bed next to her parents' double.  Their living situation deteriorated further when Hindley's sister, Maureen, was born in August 1946, and about a year later Hindley, then 5, was sent to live with a grandmother nearby.{{sfnp|Staff|2007|pp=39\u201346|ps=none}}\n\nHindley's father had served with the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]] and had been stationed in North Africa, Cyprus and Italy during the [[Second World War]].{{sfnp|Staff|2007|p=38|ps=none}}  He had been known in the army as a \"hard man\" and he expected his daughter to be equally tough; he taught her to fight and insisted that she \"stick up for herself\".  When Hindley was 8, a local boy scratched her cheeks, drawing blood.  She burst into tears and ran to her father, who threatened to \"leather\" her if she did not retaliate; Hindley found the boy and knocked him down with a series of punches.  As she wrote later, \"at eight years old I'd scored my first victory\".{{sfnp|Staff|2007|pp=49\u201350|ps=none}}\nMalcolm MacCulloch, professor of [[forensic psychiatry]] at [[Cardiff University]], has written that Hindley's \"<!--The -->relationship with her father brutalised her&nbsp;...

In 1957, he invited her to go swimming with friends at a local disused reservoir, but Hindley instead went out with another friend; Higgins drowned in the reservoir. Hindley{{mdashb}}a good swimmer{{mdashb}}was deeply upset and blamed herself. She collected for a wreath, and his funeral at [[Gorton Monastery|St Francis's Monastery]] in Gorton Lane\u2014where Hindley had been baptised a Catholic in 1942\u2014had a lasting effect on her.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|p=7|ps=none}} Hindley's mother had agreed to her father's insistence that Hindley be [[Baptism|baptised]] a Catholic, but only on the condition that she not be sent to a Catholic school; her mother believed that \"all the monks taught was [[Catechism of the Catholic Church|the catechism]]\".{{sfnp|Staff|2007|p=36|ps=none}} Hindley was increasingly drawn to the Catholic Church after she started at Ryder Brow Secondary Modern, and began taking instruction for formal reception into the Church soon after Higgins's funeral. She took the [[confirmation]] name of Veronica<!--Staff page 80 gives the name Therese-->, and received her first [[Mass (liturgy)#Communion rite|communion]] in November 1958.\n\nHindley's first job was as a junior clerk at a local electrical engineering firm.

Hindley befriended George Clitheroe, the President of the Cheadle Rifle Club, and on several occasions visited two local shooting ranges. Clitheroe, although puzzled by her interest, arranged for her to buy a .22 rifle from a gun merchant in Manchester. She also asked to join a pistol club, but she was a poor shot and allegedly often bad-tempered, so Clitheroe told her that she was unsuitable; she did though manage to purchase a [[Webley & Scott|Webley]] .45 and a [[Smith & Wesson]] .38 from other members of the club.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=37\u201340|ps=none}} Brady and Hindley's plans for robbery came to nothing, but they became interested in photography. Brady already owned a [[Brownie (camera)|Box Brownie]], which he used to take photographs of Hindley and her dog, Puppet, but he upgraded to a more sophisticated model, and also purchased lights and [[darkroom]] equipment. The pair took photographs of each other that, for the time, would have been considered explicit.

The story tells a fictionalised account of the [[Leopold and Loeb]] case, two young men from well-to-do families who attempt to commit the perfect murder of a 12-year-old boy, and escape the [[death penalty]] because of their age.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=80|ps=none}}\n\nBy June 1963, Brady had moved in with Hindley at her grandmother's house in Bannock Street, and on 12 July 1963, the two murdered their first victim, Reade, who had attended school with Hindley's younger sister, Maureen, and had also been in a short relationship with David Smith, a local boy with three criminal convictions for minor crimes.  Police found no one who had seen Reade before her disappearance, and although the 15-year-old Smith was questioned by police, he was cleared of any involvement in her death.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=41\u201345|ps=none}}  Their next victim, Kilbride, was killed on 23 November 1963.  A huge search was undertaken, with over 700&nbsp;statements taken, and 500&nbsp;\"missing\" posters printed.  Eight days after he failed to return home, 2,000&nbsp;volunteers scoured waste ground and derelict buildings.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=46\u201347|ps=none}}\n\nHindley hired a vehicle a week after Kilbride went missing, and again on 21 December 1963, apparently to make sure the burial sites had not been disturbed.  In February 1964, she bought a second-hand [[Austin Motor Company|Austin Traveller]], but soon after traded it for a [[Mini]] van.  Bennett disappeared on 16 June 1964.  His stepfather, Jimmy Johnson, became a suspect; in the two years following Bennett's disappearance, Johnson was taken for questioning on four occasions.  Detectives searched under the floorboards of the Johnsons' house, and on discovering that the houses in the row were connected, extended the search to the entire street.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=50\u201355|ps=none}}\n\n[[File:David and maureen smith nee hindley.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A young man and woman, in 1960s fashion, stand for a monochrome photograph.

None of Hindley's relatives attended; Myra did not approve of the marriage, and her mother was too embarrassed\u2014Maureen was seven months pregnant.  The newlyweds moved into Smith's father's house.  The next day, Brady suggested that the four take a day-trip to [[Windermere]].  This was the first time Brady and Smith had met properly, and Brady was apparently impressed by Smith's demeanour.  The two talked about society, the distribution of wealth, and the possibility of robbing a bank.  The young Smith was similarly impressed by Brady, who throughout the day had paid for his food and wine.  The trip to the Lake District was the first of many outings.  Hindley was apparently jealous of their relationship, but became closer to her sister.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=56\u201358|ps=none}}\n\nIn 1964, Hindley, her grandmother, and Brady were rehoused as part of the post-war slum clearances in Manchester, to 16&nbsp;Wardle Brook Avenue in the new overspill estate of Hattersley.  Brady and Hindley became friendly with Patricia Hodges, an 11-year-old girl who lived at 12&nbsp;Wardle Brook Avenue.  Hodges accompanied the two on their trips to [[Saddleworth Moor]] to collect [[peat]], something that many householders on the new estate did to improve the soil in their gardens, which were full of clay and builder's rubble.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=137|ps=none}}  She remained unharmed; living only a few doors away, her disappearance would have been easily solved.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=62\u201365|ps=none}}\n\nEarly on [[Boxing Day]] 1964, Hindley left her grandmother at a relative's house and refused to allow her back to Wardle Brook Avenue that night.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|p=65|ps=none}}  On the same day, Downey disappeared from a [[funfair]] in [[Ancoats]].{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|p=67|ps=none}}  Despite a huge search, she was not found.

Some commentators expressed the view that of the two, Hindley was the \"more evil\".{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=281\u201390|ps=none}}\n\nLord Longford, a Catholic convert, campaigned to secure the release of \"celebrated\" criminals, and Hindley in particular, which earned him constant derision from the public and the press.
