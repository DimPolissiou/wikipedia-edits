Her parents were, as she writes in the autobiographical piece, \"0\u201319,\" \"a mother-secretary & father draft dodger WWII electrician.\" Mayer's parents died when she was in her early teens and her uncle, a legal guardian after the passing of her parents, died only a few years later.  She had one sister, [[Rosemary Mayer|Rosemary]], a sculptor who was a member of similar conceptual art communities during the 1970s and 80s, in addition to being a founding member of the feminist art space [[A.I.R. Gallery|A.I.R.]] Gallery.

During July 1971, Mayer photographed one roll of film each day, resulting in a total of 1200 photographs. Mayer then recorded a 31-part narration as she remembered the context of each image, using them as \"taking-off points for digression\" and to \"[fill] in the spaces between.\" In the first full-showing of the exhibit at the 98 Greene Street Loft, the photographs were installed on boards in sequential rows as Mayer's seven-hour audio track played a single time between the gallery's open and close.

''Memory'' served as the jumping off point for Mayer's next book, a 3-year experiment in stream-of-conscious journal writing ''Studying Hunger'' (Adventures in Poetry, 1976), and these diaristic impulses would continue to be a significant part of Mayer's writing practice over the next few decades.\n\n== Writing ==\n\nMayer's record-keeping and use of [[stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream-of-consciousness]] narrative are two trademarks of her writing. In addition to the influence of her textual-visual art and journal-keeping, Mayer's poetry is widely acknowledged as some of the first to speak accurately and honestly about the experience of motherhood.<ref>{{cite web|last=Burns|first=Megan|title=Bernadette Mayer's \"Midwinter's Day\"|url=http://jacketmagazine.com/40/burns-mayer.shtml|publisher=Jacket Magazine|accessdate=February 5, 2014}}</ref> Mayer edited the journal ''0 TO 9'' with [[Vito Acconci]], and, until 1983, United Artists books and magazines with [[Lewis Warsh]].

While she has recovered, it altered her motor skills and continues to affect her writing process.\n\nMayer has corresponded extensively with many writers, including poet [[Clark Coolidge]] with whom she collaborated on The Cave, a project revolving around a trip the two of them took to Eldon's Cave in western Massachusetts.

In 1994, Mayer suffered a temporarily debilitating stroke.  While she has recovered, it altered her motor skills and continues to affect her writing process.\n\nMayer has corresponded extensively with many writers, including poet [[Clark Coolidge]] with whom she collaborated on The Cave, a project revolving around a trip the two of them took to Eldon's Cave in western Massachusetts. Mayer has also collaborated with poets [[Anne Waldman]], [[Alice Notley]], [[Lee Ann Brown]], and Jen Karmin.\n\n==Publications==\n\n*''Story'', New York: 0 to 9 Press, 1968. \n*''Moving'', New York: Angel Hair, 1971. \n*''Memory'', Plainfield, VT: North Atlantic Books, 1976. \n*''Ceremony Latin'' (1964), New York: Angel Hair, 1975. \n*''Studying Hunger'', New York: Adventures in Poetry/ Bolinas, CA: Big Sky, 1976. \n*''Poetry'', New York: Kulchur Foundation, 1976. \n*''Eruditio Ex Memoria'', Lenox, MA: Angel Hair, 1977. \n*''The Golden Book of Words'', Lenox, MA: Angel Hair, 1978. \n*''Midwinter Day'', [[Berkeley, California]], Turtle Island Foundation, 1982. \n*''Utopia'', New York: United Artists Books, 1984. \n*''Mutual Aid'' (Mademoiselle de la Mole Press, 1985) \n*''Sonnets'', New York: Tender Buttons, 1989.\n*''The Formal Field of Kissing'', New York: Catchword Papers, 1990. \n*''A Bernadette Mayer Reader'', New York: New Directions, 1992. \n*''The Desires of Mothers to Please Others in Letters'', West Stockbridge, MA: Hard Press, 1994. \n*''Another Smashed Pinecone'', New York: United Artists Books, 1998. \n*''Proper Name & other stories'', New York: New Directions, 1996. \n*''Two Haloed Mourners: Poems'', New York: Granary Books, 1998.\n*''Midwinter Day'', New York: New Directions, 1999 (reprint of 1982 edition).\n*''Scarlet Tanager'', New York: New Directions, 2005.<ref>*{{Cite book| publisher = New Directions Publishing| isbn = 978-0-8112-1582-4| last = Mayer| first = Bernadette| title = Scarlet tanager| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=D65jpBWlQFgC | year = 2005}}</ref>\n*''What's Your Idea of a Good Time?: Letters and Interviews 1977\u20131985'' with Bill Berkson, Berkeley: Tuumba Press, 2006.\n*''Poetry State Forest'', New York: New Directions, 2008.\n*''Ethics of Sleep'', New Orleans: Trembling Pillow Press, 2011.\n*''Studying Hunger Journals'', Barrytown, NY: Station Hill Press, 2011.\n*''The Helens of Troy, NY'', New York: New Directions, 2013.\n*''At Maureen's'' (with Greg Masters), New York: [http://www.cronybooks.net/ Crony Books], 2013.\n*''Eating the Colors of a Lineup of Words: The Early Books of Bernadette Mayer'' (Station Hill Press, 2015, ed.
