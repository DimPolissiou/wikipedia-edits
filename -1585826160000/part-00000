She also felt from this scene that Kim would prefer to listen before speaking and using that as a position of power.

At this point, as Kim's character was starting to become unraveled, Almeida and Seeborn used how tight the ponytail was set as an implicit sign of Kim's internal turmoil: when it was set tight, Kim was focused on her job, but if was loose, it meant she was struggling with sadness and worry.<ref name=\"vulture\" />\n\nGilligan has called Kim's arc through the fifth season an \"impending tragedy\", as her nearly-illegal actions are towards \"self-destructive behavior\".<ref name=\"vulture\" /> Katie Beth Hall portrays a young Kim in a flashback in \"[[Wexler v. Goodman]]\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-recaps/better-call-saul-recap-season-5-episode-6-wexler-goodman-969907/ |title=\u2018Better Call Saul\u2019 Recap: Girl, Interrupted |last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |date=March 23, 2020 |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=April 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Character biography ==\n=== Background ===\nAs described in flashbacks, Kim Wexler says she was raised in several [[Nebraska]] towns, including [[Red Cloud, Nebraska|Red Cloud]], but is intentionally vague about her past. In a flashback in \"Wexler v. Goodman\", Kim as a teenager is shown to have become self-reliant due to her mother's alcoholism. In \"[[The Guy for This]]\", she claims that as a child, her mother frequently moved them from place to place to keep one step ahead of landlords to whom they owed back rent, and never had a place to call home herself. Kim further claims she moved to Albuquerque because of the limited opportunities available in her hometown. Kim worked in the mailroom at Hamlin, Hamlin and McGill (HHM), where Howard Hamlin and Chuck McGill were lead partners.  Chuck's younger brother Jimmy was employed in the mailroom because of Chuck's insistence that he work a legitimate job and rid himself of his [[con artist]] past. With HHM loaning her the money to pay for law school, she completed her education and then joined the firm as an associate.  She soon became one of HHM's top lawyers, and her success inspired Jimmy to secretly attend a distance learning law school and become an attorney.  With Kim's encouragement, Jimmy started a solo practice after HHM decided against hiring him as an associate.\n\n=== Season 1 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 1)}}\nIn the show's present (2002), Jimmy, angered by how Chuck and Howard have treated him, has run-ins with HHM, including stealing a case from them and placing a billboard ad for his firm that copies Howard's signature look, the HHM colors, and HHM's logo. Kim follows Howard's direction to talk to Jimmy, but finds Jimmy's use of con games interesting; Jimmy, suggests that she should leave HHM and set up a firm with him. The fallout from Jimmy's actions cause Kim to lose some of her standing within HHM. She becomes more disenchanted with HHM after Jimmy brings the firm a potentially multi-million dollar class-action lawsuit against the Sandpiper retirement communities, only for Chuck to use Howard in blocking Jimmy's participation on the case.  When the case grows in size, HHM calls on the services of another firm, Davis & Main, and Kim recommends Jimmy to them due to his familiarity with the case and rapport with the clients. Her recommendation results in Jimmy being offered an associate's position with D&M, which would enable him to continue working on the Sandpiper case.\n\n=== Season 2 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 2)}}\nJimmy is reluctant to take the job at Davis & Main, and hides away at a luxury hotel using an assumed name and stolen credit card. Kim tracks him down and tries to convince him to take the job. Instead, Jimmy brings her in on a con, convincing another hotel patron to pay for an expensive bottle of tequila. The con is a success, and they spend the night together; Kim keeps the elaborate bottle stopper as a memento.\n\nJimmy accepts the Davis & Main job and works with Kim on the Sandpiper lawsuit. Jimmy skirts the law in soliciting Sandpiper residents to join the class, creating the potential for damage to Davis & Main's reputation among its more conservative clients.  Later, he prepares a television advertisement to attract more members for the class, and airs it without getting the approval of his D&M superiors. Kim covers for him at HHM, staining her reputation even further.  Jimmy offers to quit Davis & Main if it will help restore's Kim's reputation, but she insists she reclaim her standing at the firm on her own.  Kim works her law school and professional contacts in the hopes of obtaining a major new client for HHM, and succeeds in convincing a large regional bank, Mesa Verde, to retain HHM as outside counsel.  Howard is happy to have the business, but denies Kim credit.  Reduced to entry-level document review and arguing unwinnable motions in court, Kim's courtroom proficiency draws the attention of Richard Schweikart, a partner at Schweikart & Cokely. Schweikart tells Kim HHM is not appreciative of her talents and offers her a position at his firm. Kim considers the offer while sitting at a bar, and begins talking to a man she recognizes as a potential mark.  She calls Jimmy to join her, and they successfully complete another con, followed by another night together. Kim decides to leave HHM and establish her own solo practice, with Jimmy forming a solo practice in the same office so they can share expenses.  Kim tries to bring Mesa Verde with her, and appears to succeed, but Chuck wins them back to HHM.  Knowing that Kim wants Mesa Verde, Jimmy tampers with important documents in one of Chuck's filings on the bank's behalf.  Inconsistencies in the documents at the state banking board meeting call Chuck's competence into question.  Mesa Verde signs on with Kim, and Chuck becomes obsessed with proving Jimmy's sabotage.  Kim infers Jimmy's guilt, and tells him that if there is any evidence, Chuck will find it. Jimmy realizes the clerk at the copy store where he altered the documents can identify him, so he goes to the store to buy the clerk's silence.\n\n=== Season 3 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 3)}}\nChuck becomes increasingly obsessed with proving Jimmy's sabotage and tricks him into an incriminating statement, which Chuck records. Learning of the recording from Ernesto, Kim counsels Jimmy to wait and see what Chuck intends to do with it, but Jimmy breaks into Chuck's house to confront him, enabling Chuck to have Jimmy arrested.  Jimmy faces a bar investigation, and Kim and Jimmy's strategy of exposing Chuck's [[electromagnetic hypersensitivity]] as a [[Psychosomatic medicine|psychosomatic]] illness discredits his testimony.  Jimmy is suspended from practicing law for a year, but not disbarred.  Chuck's paranoid performance as a witness degrades his professional reputation, and HHM loses standing in Albuquerque's legal community. While Jimmy tries various ways to generate income so Kim and he can keep their shared office, Kim takes on a second client. Rushing to a meeting after little sleep, she crashes her car and breaks her arm.  To save money, Kim and Jimmy break the lease on their office and Kim practices from home, while Jimmy helps her with day-to-day activities because her arm is in a cast during her recovery.  Howard forces Chuck out of HHM, and an increasingly erratic Chuck sets a fire in his home by knocking over a camping lantern, but makes no attempt to leave.\n\n=== Season 4 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 4)}}\nFollowing Chuck's suicide, Kim tries without success to break Jimmy out of his despondent mood.  Howard tells Jimmy and Kim he thinks that his decision to force Chuck's retirement from HHM after their malpractice insurance rates rose led to Chuck's death.  Jimmy conceals his role in causing the rate increase, allows Howard to shoulder the blame, and regains his usual happy-go-lucky demeanor.  Unaware of Jimmy's actions, Kim later berates Howard for mistreating Jimmy. Kim works on Mesa Verde's rapid regional expansion, but is increasingly bored with banking law, so she begins taking ''pro bono'' criminal defense cases, which she finds more interesting and satisfying. After she is reprimanded by Paige for putting her ''pro bono'' work ahead of Mesa Verde's, Kim persuades Schweikart & Cokely to hire her as a partner to manage a new banking division, which enables her to handle the Mesa Verde work while continuing to devote time and effort to criminal defense cases.  With her career becoming more successful, she becomes more distant from Jimmy, who works a boring job as a cellular phone store manager while he serves out the suspension of his law license.\n\nBy 2004 Jimmy has a lucrative side business reselling prepaid cellular phones on the street under the alias Saul Goodman, and hires Huell Babineaux as his bodyguard.  Huell has a run-in with a police officer, who arrests him, and Jimmy convinces Kim to defend Huell to keep him from receiving a prison sentence. Finding it impossible to convince the prosecuting attorney to enter into a plea bargain, Kim and Jimmy run a con to fake a show of support for Huell in his hometown.  They keep Huell out of prison, and then engage in a con that enables Kim to replace approved plans for a Mesa Verde branch in [[Lubbock, Texas]] with plans for a larger building, saving time and expense by bypassing the city zoning and planning approval processes.  After his suspension is over, Kim helps Jimmy win reinstatement to the bar by faking remorse for Chuck's death.  He promises to do justice to the McGill name, but after winning reinstatement shocks Kim by announcing that he does not intend to practice under his own name. As Kim questions Jimmy about his plan, he tells her \"S'all good, man!\"\n\n=== Season 5 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 5)}}\nAs he regains his law license, Jimmy tells Kim he realized the \"Saul Goodman\" alias from his prepaid cell phone business provides an instant client base for a criminal law practice. He engages in several activities to generate publicity for his new practice, including giving away his remaining cell phones. Kim continues her ''pro bono'' work. In one case, Kim's client does not want to accept a favorable plea bargain, and Jimmy suggests a con to trick him into taking it. Kim refuses, but then runs the con herself. Kim later discusses the issue with Jimmy, and says she wants to succeed without having to lie, so Jimmy agrees not to cross ethical lines when it comes to her clients. The Mesa Verde bank work remains a source of irritation for Kim, taking her away from the ''pro bono'' work she finds more fulfilling.\n\nEverett Acker is a tenant on land owned by the bank. Kevin, the bank's president, wants Acker to move so the bank can create a call center on the property, but Acker refuses to leave. Kim is sympathetic to Acker and Kevin refuses any compromises, so Kim brings in Jimmy as Saul to represent Acker in a lawsuit against the bank. Jimmy engages in several ruses to delay construction and Kim advises making a deal with Acker, but Kevin refuses to negotiate. Kim attempts to withdraw from the case, claiming a conflict of interest because of Jimmy's involvement, but Kevin insists that she remain. Kim becomes resigned to Acker's eviction, so Jimmy suggests looking for \"dirt\" to use against Kevin, but recommends not doing it. Kim decides to proceed against Kevin and Jimmy agrees.\n\nJimmy hires Sobchak to surveil Kevin and search his home. Sobchak thinks his effort was unsuccessful, but Kim sees something in his photos of Kevin's house that she can use. Rich suggests Kim remove herself from Mesa Verde business temporarily, correctly deducing that her heart is not in it, but Kim angrily refuses. Kim later tells Jimmy she does not want to blackmail Kevin and offers $75,000 for Acker to settle, promising to personally pay the difference between that figure and whatever amount Kevin agrees to pay. Jimmy agrees but at the meeting to finalize the deal, he stuns everyone by asking for $4 million. Kim's insight into Sobchak's photos is that Mesa Verde's logo is based on a photograph the bank does not have permission to use. Kevin ridicules Jimmy's demand, so Jimmy threatens Kevin with an injunction against using the logo and TV ads soliciting clients for class action lawsuits against the bank which depict Kevin's father Don unfavorably. Kevin meets with Jimmy privately and agrees to a settlement that means cash payments for Acker and the photographer. Kim responds furiously to Jimmy's actions but, after initially suggesting that they separate, proposes marriage so that they can enjoy [[spousal privilege]].\n\nKim and Jimmy marry, enabling him to talk about his cases without having to lie to her. Kim and Rich apologize to Kevin for the outcome of Everett Acker's case. He lets them know he will decide whether to retain them, but after they leave, Kim leads Rich back to Kevin's office. She points out that Kevin consistently failed to heed their advice and says that whether he retains them or hires new counsel, she hopes he will be more willing to listen. Kevin indicates his approval by informing Kim and Rich that he will see them at their regular weekly meeting.\n\n== Reception ==\n[[File:Rhea Seehorn by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Rhea Seehorn]] portrays Kim Wexler.]]\nDue to Kim Wexler's popularity in ''Better Call Saul'', creator Vince Gilligan hinted at a possible spin-off about her, he also said that a Wexler spin-off is the most likely to be done, saying, \"If we were to do another spin-off it would be the Kim Wexler show\".<ref name=\"auto\" />\n\nSalon commented on Kim Wexler's role in the fourth season:\n\n{{quote|But that is precisely why Kim has become the low-key heroine of season 4.

At this point, as Kim's character was starting to become unraveled, Almeida and Seeborn used how tight the ponytail was set as an implicit sign of Kim's internal turmoil: when it was set tight, Kim was focused on her job, but if was loose, it meant she was struggling with sadness and worry.<ref name=\"vulture\" />\n\nGilligan has called Kim's arc through the fifth season an \"impending tragedy\", as her nearly-illegal actions are towards \"self-destructive behavior\".<ref name=\"vulture\" /> Katie Beth Hall portrays a young Kim in a flashback in \"[[Wexler v.

In a flashback in \"Wexler v. Goodman\", Kim as a teenager is shown to have become self-reliant due to her mother's alcoholism. In \"[[The Guy for This]]\", she claims that as a child, her mother frequently moved them from place to place to keep one step ahead of landlords to whom they owed back rent, and never had a place to call home herself. Kim further claims she moved to Albuquerque because of the limited opportunities available in her hometown. Kim worked in the mailroom at Hamlin, Hamlin and McGill (HHM), where Howard Hamlin and Chuck McGill were lead partners.  Chuck's younger brother Jimmy was employed in the mailroom because of Chuck's insistence that he work a legitimate job and rid himself of his [[con artist]] past. With HHM loaning her the money to pay for law school, she completed her education and then joined the firm as an associate.  She soon became one of HHM's top lawyers, and her success inspired Jimmy to secretly attend a distance learning law school and become an attorney.  With Kim's encouragement, Jimmy started a solo practice after HHM decided against hiring him as an associate.\n\n=== Season 1 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 1)}}\nIn the show's present (2002), Jimmy, angered by how Chuck and Howard have treated him, has run-ins with HHM, including stealing a case from them and placing a billboard ad for his firm that copies Howard's signature look, the HHM colors, and HHM's logo. Kim follows Howard's direction to talk to Jimmy, but finds Jimmy's use of con games interesting; Jimmy, suggests that she should leave HHM and set up a firm with him. The fallout from Jimmy's actions cause Kim to lose some of her standing within HHM. She becomes more disenchanted with HHM after Jimmy brings the firm a potentially multi-million dollar class-action lawsuit against the Sandpiper retirement communities, only for Chuck to use Howard in blocking Jimmy's participation on the case.  When the case grows in size, HHM calls on the services of another firm, Davis & Main, and Kim recommends Jimmy to them due to his familiarity with the case and rapport with the clients. Her recommendation results in Jimmy being offered an associate's position with D&M, which would enable him to continue working on the Sandpiper case.\n\n=== Season 2 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 2)}}\nJimmy is reluctant to take the job at Davis & Main, and hides away at a luxury hotel using an assumed name and stolen credit card. Kim tracks him down and tries to convince him to take the job. Instead, Jimmy brings her in on a con, convincing another hotel patron to pay for an expensive bottle of tequila. The con is a success, and they spend the night together; Kim keeps the elaborate bottle stopper as a memento.\n\nJimmy accepts the Davis & Main job and works with Kim on the Sandpiper lawsuit. Jimmy skirts the law in soliciting Sandpiper residents to join the class, creating the potential for damage to Davis & Main's reputation among its more conservative clients.  Later, he prepares a television advertisement to attract more members for the class, and airs it without getting the approval of his D&M superiors. Kim covers for him at HHM, staining her reputation even further.  Jimmy offers to quit Davis & Main if it will help restore's Kim's reputation, but she insists she reclaim her standing at the firm on her own.  Kim works her law school and professional contacts in the hopes of obtaining a major new client for HHM, and succeeds in convincing a large regional bank, Mesa Verde, to retain HHM as outside counsel.  Howard is happy to have the business, but denies Kim credit.  Reduced to entry-level document review and arguing unwinnable motions in court, Kim's courtroom proficiency draws the attention of Richard Schweikart, a partner at Schweikart & Cokely. Schweikart tells Kim HHM is not appreciative of her talents and offers her a position at his firm. Kim considers the offer while sitting at a bar, and begins talking to a man she recognizes as a potential mark.  She calls Jimmy to join her, and they successfully complete another con, followed by another night together. Kim decides to leave HHM and establish her own solo practice, with Jimmy forming a solo practice in the same office so they can share expenses.  Kim tries to bring Mesa Verde with her, and appears to succeed, but Chuck wins them back to HHM.  Knowing that Kim wants Mesa Verde, Jimmy tampers with important documents in one of Chuck's filings on the bank's behalf.  Inconsistencies in the documents at the state banking board meeting call Chuck's competence into question.  Mesa Verde signs on with Kim, and Chuck becomes obsessed with proving Jimmy's sabotage.  Kim infers Jimmy's guilt, and tells him that if there is any evidence, Chuck will find it. Jimmy realizes the clerk at the copy store where he altered the documents can identify him, so he goes to the store to buy the clerk's silence.\n\n=== Season 3 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 3)}}\nChuck becomes increasingly obsessed with proving Jimmy's sabotage and tricks him into an incriminating statement, which Chuck records. Learning of the recording from Ernesto, Kim counsels Jimmy to wait and see what Chuck intends to do with it, but Jimmy breaks into Chuck's house to confront him, enabling Chuck to have Jimmy arrested.  Jimmy faces a bar investigation, and Kim and Jimmy's strategy of exposing Chuck's [[electromagnetic hypersensitivity]] as a [[Psychosomatic medicine|psychosomatic]] illness discredits his testimony.  Jimmy is suspended from practicing law for a year, but not disbarred.  Chuck's paranoid performance as a witness degrades his professional reputation, and HHM loses standing in Albuquerque's legal community. While Jimmy tries various ways to generate income so Kim and he can keep their shared office, Kim takes on a second client. Rushing to a meeting after little sleep, she crashes her car and breaks her arm.  To save money, Kim and Jimmy break the lease on their office and Kim practices from home, while Jimmy helps her with day-to-day activities because her arm is in a cast during her recovery.  Howard forces Chuck out of HHM, and an increasingly erratic Chuck sets a fire in his home by knocking over a camping lantern, but makes no attempt to leave.\n\n=== Season 4 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 4)}}\nFollowing Chuck's suicide, Kim tries without success to break Jimmy out of his despondent mood.  Howard tells Jimmy and Kim he thinks that his decision to force Chuck's retirement from HHM after their malpractice insurance rates rose led to Chuck's death.  Jimmy conceals his role in causing the rate increase, allows Howard to shoulder the blame, and regains his usual happy-go-lucky demeanor.  Unaware of Jimmy's actions, Kim later berates Howard for mistreating Jimmy. Kim works on Mesa Verde's rapid regional expansion, but is increasingly bored with banking law, so she begins taking ''pro bono'' criminal defense cases, which she finds more interesting and satisfying. After she is reprimanded by Paige for putting her ''pro bono'' work ahead of Mesa Verde's, Kim persuades Schweikart & Cokely to hire her as a partner to manage a new banking division, which enables her to handle the Mesa Verde work while continuing to devote time and effort to criminal defense cases.  With her career becoming more successful, she becomes more distant from Jimmy, who works a boring job as a cellular phone store manager while he serves out the suspension of his law license.\n\nBy 2004 Jimmy has a lucrative side business reselling prepaid cellular phones on the street under the alias Saul Goodman, and hires Huell Babineaux as his bodyguard.  Huell has a run-in with a police officer, who arrests him, and Jimmy convinces Kim to defend Huell to keep him from receiving a prison sentence. Finding it impossible to convince the prosecuting attorney to enter into a plea bargain, Kim and Jimmy run a con to fake a show of support for Huell in his hometown.  They keep Huell out of prison, and then engage in a con that enables Kim to replace approved plans for a Mesa Verde branch in [[Lubbock, Texas]] with plans for a larger building, saving time and expense by bypassing the city zoning and planning approval processes.  After his suspension is over, Kim helps Jimmy win reinstatement to the bar by faking remorse for Chuck's death.  He promises to do justice to the McGill name, but after winning reinstatement shocks Kim by announcing that he does not intend to practice under his own name. As Kim questions Jimmy about his plan, he tells her \"S'all good, man!\"\n\n=== Season 5 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 5)}}\nAs he regains his law license, Jimmy tells Kim he realized the \"Saul Goodman\" alias from his prepaid cell phone business provides an instant client base for a criminal law practice. He engages in several activities to generate publicity for his new practice, including giving away his remaining cell phones. Kim continues her ''pro bono'' work. In one case, Kim's client does not want to accept a favorable plea bargain, and Jimmy suggests a con to trick him into taking it. Kim refuses, but then runs the con herself. Kim later discusses the issue with Jimmy, and says she wants to succeed without having to lie, so Jimmy agrees not to cross ethical lines when it comes to her clients. The Mesa Verde bank work remains a source of irritation for Kim, taking her away from the ''pro bono'' work she finds more fulfilling.\n\nEverett Acker is a tenant on land owned by the bank. Kevin, the bank's president, wants Acker to move so the bank can create a call center on the property, but Acker refuses to leave. Kim is sympathetic to Acker and Kevin refuses any compromises, so Kim brings in Jimmy as Saul to represent Acker in a lawsuit against the bank. Saul engages in several ruses to delay construction and Kim advises making a deal with Acker, but Kevin refuses to negotiate. Kim attempts to withdraw from the case, claiming a conflict of interest because of Jimmy's involvement, but Kevin insists that she remain. Kim becomes resigned to Acker's eviction, so Jimmy suggests looking for \"dirt\" to use against Kevin, but recommends not doing it. Kim decides to proceed against Kevin and Jimmy agrees.\n\nJimmy hires Sobchak to surveil Kevin and search his home. Sobchak thinks his effort was unsuccessful, but Kim sees something in his photos of Kevin's house that she can use. Rich suggests Kim remove herself from Mesa Verde business temporarily, correctly deducing that her heart is not in it, but Kim angrily refuses. Kim later tells Jimmy she does not want to blackmail Kevin and offers $75,000 for Acker to settle, promising to personally pay the difference between that figure and whatever amount Kevin agrees to pay. Jimmy agrees but at the meeting to finalize the deal, he stuns everyone by asking for $4 million. Kim's insight into Sobchak's photos is that Mesa Verde's logo is based on a photograph the bank does not have permission to use. Kevin ridicules Jimmy's demand, so Jimmy threatens Kevin with an injunction against using the logo and TV ads soliciting clients for class action lawsuits against the bank which depict Kevin's father Don unfavorably. Kevin meets with Jimmy privately and agrees to a settlement that means cash payments for Acker and the photographer. Kim responds furiously to Jimmy's actions but, after initially suggesting that they separate, proposes marriage so that they can enjoy [[spousal privilege]].\n\nKim and Jimmy marry, enabling him to talk about his cases without having to lie to her. Kim and Rich apologize to Kevin for the outcome of Everett Acker's case. He lets them know he will decide whether to retain them, but after they leave, Kim leads Rich back to Kevin's office. She points out that Kevin consistently failed to heed their advice and says that whether he retains them or hires new counsel, she hopes he will be more willing to listen. Kevin indicates his approval by informing Kim and Rich that he will see them at their regular weekly meeting.\n\n== Reception ==\n[[File:Rhea Seehorn by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Rhea Seehorn]] portrays Kim Wexler.]]\nDue to Kim Wexler's popularity in ''Better Call Saul'', creator Vince Gilligan hinted at a possible spin-off about her, he also said that a Wexler spin-off is the most likely to be done, saying, \"If we were to do another spin-off it would be the Kim Wexler show\".<ref name=\"auto\" />\n\nSalon commented on Kim Wexler's role in the fourth season:\n\n{{quote|But that is precisely why Kim has become the low-key heroine of season 4.

When the sun is well above the horizon, direct scattering of sunlight (Rayleigh scattering) is the overwhelmingly dominant source of light. However, in twilight, the period of time between sunset and night and between night and sunrise, the situation is more complicated. [[Green flash]]es and green rays are optical phenomena that occur shortly after sunset or before sunrise, when a green spot is visible above the sun, usually for no more than a second or two, or it may resemble a green ray shooting up from the sunset point. Green flashes are a group of phenomena that stem from different causes,<ref name=\"young\">{{cite news | author=Young, A. | url=http://mintaka.sdsu.edu/GF/papers/Zenit/glance.html | title=Green flashes at a glance | date=2006 | work=San Diego State University page | accessdate=5 March 2009}}</ref> most of which occur when there is a temperature inversion (when the temperature increases with altitude rather than the normal decrease in temperature with altitude). Green flashes may be observed from any altitude (even from an aircraft). They are usually seen at an unobstructed horizon, such as over the ocean, but are also seen over cloud tops and mountain tops. Green flashes may also be observed at the horizon in association with the Moon and bright planets, including Venus and Jupiter.<ref>{{cite web|last=Nave|first=C.R.|title=Red Sunset, Green Flash|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/atmos/redsun.html|work=Georgia State University|publisher=HyperPhysics|accessdate=11 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=O'Connell|first=D.J.K.|title=The green flash and other low sun phenomena|journal=Castel Gandolfo: Vatican Observatory, Ricerche Astronomiche|date=1958|volume=4|page=7|bibcode=1958RA......4.....O}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Earth's shadow]] is the shadow that the Earth casts on its atmosphere. This atmospheric phenomenon is sometimes seen twice a day, around the times of sunset and sunrise.  When the weather conditions and the observer's viewing point permit a clear sight of the horizon, the shadow can be seen as a dark blue or greyish-blue band. Assuming the sky is clear, the Earth's shadow is visible in the half of the sky opposite to the sunset or sunrise, and is seen as a dark blue band right above the horizon. A related phenomenon is the \"[[Belt of Venus]]\" or \"anti-twilight arch\", a pink band that is visible above the dark blue band of the Earth's shadow in the same part of the sky. There is no clear dividing line between the Earth's shadow and the Belt of Venus: one colored band shades into the other in the sky.<ref name=AO>{{cite web|title=Earth's shadow|publisher = Les Cowley |author =Les Cowley|date=2 August 2009|accessdate=15 February 2012|url = http://www.atoptics.co.uk/atoptics/earshad.htm}}</ref><ref name=earth-shadow>{{cite book|title=Color and light in nature|author= David K.

The term is usually associated with [[skygazing]] and [[astronomy]], with reference to views of [[celestial bodies]] such as stars, the Moon, and planets that become visible on a clear night after the Sun has set. Natural light sources in a night sky include moonlight, starlight, and airglow, depending on location and timing.  The fact that the sky is not completely dark at night can be easily observed. Were the sky (in the absence of moon and city lights) absolutely dark, one would not be able to see the silhouette of an object against the sky.\n\nThe night sky and studies of it have a historical place in both ancient and modern cultures.

However, in twilight, the period of time between sunset and night and between night and sunrise, the situation is more complicated. [[Green flash]]es and green rays are optical phenomena that occur shortly after sunset or before sunrise, when a green spot is visible above the sun, usually for no more than a second or two, or it may resemble a green ray shooting up from the sunset point.

[[Dyeus]] is reconstructed as the god of the sky, or the sky personified, in [[Proto-Indo-European religion]], whence [[Zeus]], the god of the sky and thunder in [[Greek mythology]] and the [[Roman mythology|Roman]] god of sky and thunder [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]].\n\nIn [[Australian Aboriginal mythology]], [[Altjira]] (or Arrernte) is the main sky god and also the creator god. In [[Iroquois mythology]], [[Atahensic]] was a sky goddess who fell down to the ground during the creation of the Earth. Many cultures have drawn constellations between stars in the sky, using them in association with legends and mythology about their deities.\n\n== Gallery ==\n{{gallery\n|title=\n|File:3D-Clouds.jpg|Massive clouds sweeping across the [[Mojave Desert]]\n|File:High Desert Summer Sunset.jpg|Summer sunset [[High Desert (California)|High Desert]], [[California]]\n|File:Split Sky.jpg|Split sky just after sunset, High Desert, California\n|File:Desert Electric.jpg|Violent sky during Electric storm at twilight in the California [[Mojave Desert]].\n|File:Burning Yellow Sunset.jpg|The clouds reflect shadows at sunset, and fan them throughout the sky. \n|File:Sky in Lithuania.jpg|Sky with clouds in Lithuania, D\u016bdos (Village), [[Lithuania]].\n|File:Massive Towering Vertical.jpg|Massive towering vertical cloud arising from behind the San Gabriel mountains,\nand viewed from the [[Mojave desert]], California \n|File:Auvergne, d\u00e9cembre 2018 \u2014 29.jpg|Night sky with many stars.\n\n}}\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Cyanometer]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category}}\n{{Wikiquote}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110826203901/http://scijinks.nasa.gov/blue-sky Why is the sky blue?]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Meteorological concepts]]\n[[Category:Observational astronomy]]\n[[Category:Sky| ]]\n[[Category:Meteorological phenomena]]\n", "name_user": "Anand Anil", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky"}

transmission\".<ref name=\"WHO-SR12\" /> However, an epidemiological model of the beginning of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic in mainland China|outbreak in China]] suggested that \"pre-symptomatic shedding may be typical among documented infections\" and that [[subclinical infection]]s may have been the source of a majority of infections.<ref name=\"ScienceRapid\"

humans were infected via an intermediate host.<ref name=\"nature feb2020\" />\n\nA [[metagenomic]] study published in 2019 previously revealed that [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]], the strain of the virus that causes [[SARS]], was the most widely distributed coronavirus among a sample of [[Sunda pangolin]]s.<ref name=\"VirusesPangolins\" /> On 7 February 2020, it was announced that researchers from [[Guangzhou]] had discovered a [[pangolin]] sample with a viral nucleic acid sequence \"99% identical\" to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NaturePang\" /> When released, the results clarified that \"the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of the newly discovered Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with one [[amino acid]] difference.\"<ref name=\"Isolation\" /> Pangolins are protected under Chinese law, but their [[pangolin trade|poaching and trading]] for use in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] remains common.<ref

pangolins in the origin of SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"WongRecombination\" /> However, pangolin coronaviruses found to date only share at most 92% of their whole genomes with SARS-CoV-2, making them less similar than RaTG13 to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"CurrentOrigin\" /> This is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the intermediate host; in comparison, the SARS virus responsible for the 2002\u20132004

It is a [[Positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus|positive-sense single-stranded RNA]] (+ssRNA) virus. Other coronaviruses are capable of causing illnesses ranging from the [[common cold]] to more severe diseases such as [[Middle East respiratory syndrome]] (MERS). It is the seventh known coronavirus to infect people, after [[Human coronavirus 229E|229E]], [[Human coronavirus NL63|NL63]], [[Human coronavirus OC43|OC43]], [[Human coronavirus HKU1|HKU1]], [[Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus|MERS-CoV]], and the original SARS-CoV.<ref name=\"NEJM-Novel\" />\n\nLike the SARS-related coronavirus strain implicated in the 2003 SARS outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the subgenus ''[[Sarbecovirus]]'' ([[beta-CoV]] lineage B).<ref name=\"NextstrainPhylogeny\" /><ref name=\"Wong2019\" /> Its [[RNA]] sequence is approximately 30,000 [[nucleobase|base]]s in length.<ref name=\"gisaid\"/> SARS-CoV-2 is unique among known betacoronaviruses in its incorporation of a polybasic cleavage site, a characteristic known to increase [[pathogenicity]] and [[Basic reproduction number|transmissibility]] in other viruses.<ref name=\"Proximal\" /><ref name=\"CellWalls\" /><ref name=\"AntiviralCleavage\" />\n\nWith a sufficient number of sequenced [[genome]]s, it is possible to reconstruct a [[phylogenetic tree]] of the mutation history of a family of viruses.
