It is generally not discovered until 2\u20133 years of age, since growth is normal at first. Pseudoachondroplasia is usually first detected by a drop of linear growth in contrast to peers, a [[waddling gait]] or arising lower limb deformities.<ref name=gamal2017/>\n\nPseudoachondroplasia (also known as PSACH, Pseudoachondroplastic dysplasia, and Pseudoachondroplastic spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia syndrome) is an [[osteochondrodysplasia]] that results in mild to severely [[short stature]] due to the inhibition of skeletal growth primarily in the limbs.<ref name=gamal2017/>  Though similarities in nomenclature may cause confusion, Pseudoachondroplasia should not be confused with [[achondroplasia]], which is a clinically and genetically distinct [[skeletal dysplasia]].  Pseudoachondroplasia is caused by a heterozygous mutation in the gene encoding cartilage oligomeric matrix protein COMP. Mutation in the COMP gene can also cause [[multiple epiphyseal dysplasia]]. Despite the radioclinical similarities between pseudoachondroplasia and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, the latter is less severe.<ref>[https://www.omim.org/entry/132400 132400]</ref>\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nDisproportionate [[short stature]], deformity of the lower limbs, short fingers, and \nligamentous laxity give pseudoachondroplasia its distinctive features. The average height of adult males with the condition is around 120 centimeters (3&nbsp;ft, 11 in), while adult females are typically around 116&nbsp;cm (3&nbsp;ft, 9in).  Affected individuals are not noticeably short at birth. Patients with pseudoachondroplasia present with gait abnormalities, lower limb deformity, or a retarded growth rate that characteristically appear at age 2\u20133 years.  Disproportionate [[short stature]] is characterized by shortening of proximal limb segments (humeri and femora) also called rhizomelic shortening. Other known clinical features include, genu valgum/varum, brachydactyly (short fingers), supple flexion deformity of the hips, knees, hyperlordosis of lumbar spine, rocker bottom feet and broadening of the metaphyseal ends of long bones especially around the wrists, knees and ankles. Patients with pseudoachondroplasia have normal intelligence and craniofacial features.<ref name=gamal2017>{{cite journal | author = Gamal R, Elsayed SM, EL-Sobky TA, Elabd HS | year = 2017 | title = Pseudoachondroplasia in a child: the role of anthropometric measurements and skeletal imaging in differential diagnosis | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378603X16301954 | journal = Egypt J Radiol Nucl Med | volume = 48 | issue = 1| pages = 245\u201350 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejrnm.2016.10.007 }}</ref><ref name=moosa2013>{{cite journal | author = Moosa S, Nishimura G | year = 2013 | title = Pseudoachondroplasia: report on a South African family | url = | journal = S Afr J Rad | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 65\u20137 | doi = 10.7196/SAJR.767 }}</ref><ref name=jackson2012>{{cite journal | author = Jackson GC, Mittaz-Crettol L, Taylor JA, Mortier GR, Spranger J, Zabel B | display-authors = etal | year = 2012 | title = Pseudoachondroplasia and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia: a 7-year comprehensive analysis of the known disease genes identify novel and recurrent mutations and provides an accurate assessment of their relative contribution | journal = Hum.

The offspring of affected individuals are at 50% risk of inheriting the mutant allele.  Prenatal testing by molecular genetic examination is available if the disease-causing mutation has been identified in an affected family member (Hecht et al. 1995).\n\n==Pathophysiology==  \nCOMP is an extracellular calcium binding protein directly involved in chondrocyte migration and proliferation.  It is observed at a high frequency in chondrocytes in developing bone and tendon.  In pseudochondroplasia, COMP is not secreted, but instead collects in the chondrocytes, ultimately poisoning and killing them.  Though some chondrocytes do manage to survive, growth is significantly reduced, resulting in the characteristically short limbs and seemingly unaffected face and torso of those inflicted with the disorder (OMIM 2008).  Mutations in COMP result in a phenotypic spectrum that varies from pseudochondroplasia (at the most extreme end) to multiple epiphyseal dysplasia or MED (a genetically similar, though milder skeletal dysplasia).<ref name=jackson2012/>\n\nStudies conducted by Hetch et al. suggest that type IX collagen, a collagen active specifically in the construction of cartilage, plays a key role in pseudoachondroplasia.  The researchers found that IX collagen was amassed within the pseudoachondroplasia chondrocytes.  This discovery suggests that the pathogenesis of pseudoachondroplasia involves the interactions of the mutant COMP gene products with specific cartilage components, such as type IX collagen, and that it is not solely the result of the effects of mutant molecules on the production and secretion of COMP (OMIM 2008).\n\n===Molecular biology===\nThe COMP gene is located on chromosome 19p13.1; its precise locus is P49747.  COMP contains 19 exons. The cartilage oligomeric matrix protein is 757 aa (OMIM 2008). COMP protein is found in the [[extracellular matrix]], a complex web of proteins and other molecules that form in the spaces between the cells that make up ligaments and tendons.  It is also found near [[chondrocytes]] (cartilage-forming cells). Chondrocytes play a vital role in [[osteogenesis]] (the formation of bone), particularly in the spine, hips, and limbs where osteogenesis begins with the formation of cartilage, which is then calcified and transformed into bone.  We do not yet fully understand the normal function of COMP protein, though it is believed to play a part in cellular growth, division and [[apoptosis]] (self-destruction) of cells, as well as participating in the regulation of cell movement and attachment (OMIM 2008).\n\nNearly 60 mutations in the COMP gene have been identified in individuals with pseudoachondroplasia.  However, the mutation responsible for the most common allele is a deletion of one codon within a very short triplet repeat (GAC), in which the 469th amino acid, an aspartic acid, is deleted (OMIM 2008).\n\n==Diagnosis== \n[[File:Pseudoachondroplasia. 02.jpg|thumb|Pseudoachondroplasia.

However, no precise incidence figures are currently available (Suri et al. 2004).\n\n==History== \nIn 1995 the gene responsible for Pseudoachondroplasia was identified by a research team led by Dr. Jacqueline Hecht of The University of Texas-Houston, Health Science Center.  This discovery additionally shed light on the COMP protein, which the team recognized as somehow involved in skeletal growth and height determination (Hetch et al. 1995).<ref name=\"Adelson2011\">{{cite book|last=Adelson|first=Betty M. |title=Dwarfism: Medical and Psychosocial Aspects of Profound Short Stature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_lR1e5sBkd8C&pg=PT39|year=2011|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=978-0-8018-8121-3 |page=39}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, Hetch and her colleagues from the Research Department at Shriners Hospital for Children in Portland, Oregon conducted further research, which led to their discovery that the intracellular fate of mutant COMP is determined by the environment of individual chondrocytes, contrary to the previous notion that COMP activities leading to Pseudoachondroplasia were determined by structural effects of the mutation on COMP; this meant that COMP activities are cell-specific (Hetch et al. 1995).\n\nHetch et al. also discovered type IX collagen accumulated within the Pseudoachondroplasia chondrocytes.  This discovery indicated the pathogenesis of Pseudoachondroplasia results from the interactions of the products of the mutant COMP allele with certain \u201ccartilage components,\u201d particularly with type IX collagen (Hetch et al. 1995).\n\n==See also==\n*[[Achondroplasia]]\n*[[Dwarfism]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n{{Medical resources\n | DiseasesDB     = 32766\n | ICD10          = {{ICD10|Q|77|3|q|65}}\n | ICD9           = {{ICD9|756.4}}\n | ICDO           = \n | OMIM           = 177170\n | MedlinePlus    = \n | eMedicineSubj  = \n | eMedicineTopic = \n | MeshID         = \n | Orphanet         = 750\n}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060925081247/http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/greenbergcenter/pseudoac.htm Clinical summary at hopkinsmedicine.org]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20051119032832/http://www.nemours.org/internet?url=no/dysplasia/pseudoachondroplasia.html Skeletal Dysplasia at nemours.org]\n* {{GeneTests|psach}}\n*[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=177170 OMIM: Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man. \u201cPseudoachondroplasia, PSACH\u201d]\n\n{{Scleroprotein disease}}\n\n[[Category:Growth disorders]]\n[[Category:Scleroprotein and ECM diseases]]\n[[Category:Autosomal dominant disorders]]\n", "text_old": "{{citation style|date=September 2018}}\n{{Infobox medical condition (new)\n | name           = Pseudoachondroplasia\n | image          = Pseudoachondroplasia. 01.jpg\n | caption        = Pseudoachondroplasia.

This discovery additionally shed light on the COMP protein, which the team recognized as somehow involved in skeletal growth and height determination (Hetch et al. 1995).<ref name=\"Adelson2011\">{{cite book|last=Adelson|first=Betty M. |title=Dwarfism: Medical and Psychosocial Aspects of Profound Short Stature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_lR1e5sBkd8C&pg=PT39|year=2011|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=978-0-8018-8121-3 |page=39}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, Hetch and her colleagues from the Research Department at Shriners Hospital for Children in Portland, Oregon conducted further research, which led to their discovery that the intracellular fate of mutant COMP is determined by the environment of individual chondrocytes, contrary to the previous notion that COMP activities leading to Pseudoachondroplasia were determined by structural effects of the mutation on COMP; this meant that COMP activities are cell-specific (Hetch et al. 1995).\n\nHetch et al. also discovered type IX collagen accumulated within the Pseudoachondroplasia chondrocytes.  This discovery indicated the pathogenesis of Pseudoachondroplasia results from the interactions of the products of the mutant COMP allele with certain \u201ccartilage components,\u201d particularly with type IX collagen (Hetch et al. 1995).\n\n==See also==\n*[[Achondroplasia]]\n*[[Dwarfism]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n{{Medical resources\n | DiseasesDB     = 32766\n | ICD10          = {{ICD10|Q|77|3|q|65}}\n | ICD9           = {{ICD9|756.4}}\n | ICDO           = \n | OMIM           = 177170\n | MedlinePlus    = \n | eMedicineSubj  = \n | eMedicineTopic = \n | MeshID         = \n | Orphanet         = 750\n}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060925081247/http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/greenbergcenter/pseudoac.htm Clinical summary at hopkinsmedicine.org]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20051119032832/http://www.nemours.org/internet?url=no/dysplasia/pseudoachondroplasia.html Skeletal Dysplasia at nemours.org]\n* {{GeneTests|psach}}\n*[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=177170 OMIM: Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man. \u201cPseudoachondroplasia, PSACH\u201d]\n\n{{Scleroprotein disease}}\n\n[[Category:Growth disorders]]\n[[Category:Scleroprotein and ECM diseases]]\n[[Category:Autosomal dominant disorders]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSigns and symptoms:Journal cites:, added 1 PMC, templated 3 journal cites, added 1 issue number", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoachondroplasia"}

Rebecca DeFalco told US marshals that her former lover told her he had killed a man who was a \"problem\" and gave her a graphic description of the murder. The victim, a sitting tenant who had lived in the flat for most of his adult life, refused to move out after Papalexis received a \u00a32.3 million offer for the derelict warehouse in Kilburn. The developer was desperate to sell to raise funds to save his ailing business. It was claimed that he ordered hired hands to beat and kill Mr Christodoulides in March 2000.\n\nPapalexis, the son of a Greek shipping operations manager (not a shipowner as Papalexis contended), was found guilty on 4 September 2009 of murder after a three-month trial at the [[Old Bailey]].

As the receivers moved in, he fled to the US and reinvented himself as a debonair playboy, dressing in [[Savile Row]] suits, driving a [[Bentley]] and kitting out his office with thrones. He attended parties with America's social elite, including [[Paris Hilton]] and the designer [[Valentino Garavani|Valentino]]. He invited friends to his beach-front mansion in Florida to join [[Bill Clinton]] at a fundraising gala for his wife, [[Hillary Clinton|Hillary]].\n\nAfter Mr Christodoulides's body was found, the investigation stalled because of a lack of evidence. However, a cigarette stub gathered in the warehouse yielded Papalexis's and, allegedly, his henchmen's DNA. There were also fingerprints on tape used to bind the victim's feet. When the Albanians were arrested they said that Papalexis had asked them to go to the warehouse and forced them at gunpoint to wrap the body. Papalexis was arrested in Palm Beach, Florida, extradited and charged with murder. At the time of his arrest his American business dealings were in turmoil; he was being chased by creditors for $2 million (\u00a31.2 million), including for unpaid rent on his $3 million mansion.\n\nDuring the trial, he was described as a \"classic [[psychopath]]\" whose gratification in criminal, sexual and aggressive impulses was out of control. He indulged in sadistic sex and hired prostitutes for orgies at his mansion. In his entry on a sadomasochism website, he described himself as \"the king of his own realm and all others are to be subjected to his will\".\n\nThe jury initially failed to reach verdicts on Baxhija and Xhelo, who were both charged with murder.

A control problem includes a [[cost functional]] that is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of state and control variables. An '''optimal control''' is a set of [[differential equation]]s describing the paths of the control variables that minimize the cost function. The optimal control can be derived using [[Pontryagin's maximum principle]] (a [[necessary condition]] also known as Pontryagin's minimum principle or simply Pontryagin's Principle),<ref>{{cite book |first=I. M. |last=Ross |authorlink=I. Michael Ross |year=2009 |title=A Primer on Pontryagin's Principle in Optimal Control |location= |publisher=Collegiate Publishers |isbn=978-0-9843571-0-9 }}</ref> or by solving the [[Hamilton\u2013Jacobi\u2013Bellman equation]] (a [[sufficient condition]]).\n\nWe begin with a simple example. Consider a car traveling in a straight line on a hilly road. The question is, how should the driver press the accelerator pedal in order to ''minimize'' the total traveling time? In this example, the term ''control law'' refers specifically to the way in which the driver presses the accelerator and shifts the gears. The ''system'' consists of both the car and the road, and the ''optimality criterion'' is the minimization of the total traveling time. Control problems usually include ancillary [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraint]]s. For example, the amount of available fuel might be limited, the accelerator pedal cannot be pushed through the floor of the car, speed limits, etc.\n\nA proper cost function will be a mathematical expression giving the traveling time as a function of the speed, geometrical considerations, and [[initial condition]]s of the system. [[constraint (mathematics)|Constraint]]s are often interchangeable with the cost function.\n\nAnother related optimal control problem may be to find the way to drive the car so as to minimize its fuel consumption, given that it must complete a given course in a time not exceeding some amount. Yet another related control problem may be to minimize the total monetary cost of completing the trip, given assumed monetary prices for time and fuel.\n\nA more abstract framework goes as follows.

The terms <math>\\Phi</math> and <math>\\mathcal{L}</math> are called the ''endpoint cost '' and ''[[Lagrange multiplier|Lagrangian]]'', respectively.  Furthermore, it is noted that the path constraints are in general ''inequality'' constraints and thus may not be active (i.e., equal to zero) at the optimal solution.  It is also noted that the optimal control problem as stated above may have multiple solutions (i.e., the solution may not be unique).  Thus, it is most often the case that any solution <math>[\\textbf{x}^*(t^*),\\textbf{u}^*(t^*),t^*]</math> to the optimal control problem is ''locally minimizing''.\n\n==Linear quadratic control==\nA special case of the general nonlinear optimal control problem given in the previous section is the [[Linear-quadratic regulator|''linear quadratic'' (LQ) optimal control problem]].  The LQ problem is stated as follows.  Minimize the ''quadratic'' continuous-time cost functional\n\n:<math>J=\\tfrac{1}{2} \\mathbf{x}^{\\mathsf{T}}(t_f)\\mathbf{S}_f\\mathbf{x}(t_f) + \\tfrac{1}{2} \\int_{t_0}\\limits^{t_f} [\\,\\mathbf{x}^{\\mathsf{T}}(t)\\mathbf{Q}(t)\\mathbf{x}(t) + \\mathbf{u}^{\\mathsf{T}}(t)\\mathbf{R}(t)\\mathbf{u}(t)\\,]\\, \\operatorname{d}t</math>\n\nSubject to the ''linear'' first-order dynamic constraints\n\n:<math>\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}(t)=\\mathbf{A}(t) \\mathbf{x}(t) + \\mathbf{B}(t) \\mathbf{u}(t), </math>\n\nand the initial condition\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{x}(t_0) = \\mathbf{x}_0</math>\n\nA particular form of the LQ problem that arises in many control system problems is that of the ''linear quadratic regulator'' (LQR) where all of the matrices (i.e., <math>\\mathbf{A}</math>, <math>\\mathbf{B}</math>, <math>\\mathbf{Q}</math>, and <math>\\mathbf{R}</math>) are ''constant'', the initial time is arbitrarily set to zero, and the terminal time is taken in the limit <math>t_f\\rightarrow\\infty</math> (this last assumption is what is known as ''infinite horizon'').  The LQR problem is stated as follows.  Minimize the infinite horizon quadratic continuous-time cost functional\n\n:<math>J=\\tfrac{1}{2} \\int\\limits_{0}^{\\infty}[\\,\\mathbf{x}^{\\mathsf{T}}(t)\\mathbf{Q}\\mathbf{x}(t) + \\mathbf{u}^{\\mathsf{T}}(t)\\mathbf{R}\\mathbf{u}(t)\\,]\\, \\operatorname{d}t</math>\n\nSubject to the ''linear time-invariant'' first-order dynamic constraints\n\n:<math>\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}(t)=\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{x}(t) + \\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{u}(t), </math>\n\nand the initial condition\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{x}(t_0) = \\mathbf{x}_0</math>\n\nIn the finite-horizon case the matrices are restricted in that <math>\\mathbf{Q}</math> and <math>\\mathbf{R}</math> are positive semi-definite and positive definite, respectively.  In the infinite-horizon case, however, the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] <math>\\mathbf{Q}</math> and <math>\\mathbf{R}</math> are not only positive-semidefinite and positive-definite, respectively, but are also ''constant''.  These additional restrictions on\n<math>\\mathbf{Q}</math> and <math>\\mathbf{R}</math> in the infinite-horizon case are enforced to ensure that the cost functional remains positive.  Furthermore, in order to ensure that the cost function is ''bounded'', the additional restriction is imposed that the pair <math>(\\mathbf{A},\\mathbf{B})</math> is ''[[Controllability|controllable]]''.  Note that the LQ or LQR cost functional can be thought of physically as attempting to minimize the ''control energy'' (measured as a quadratic form).\n\nThe infinite horizon problem (i.e., LQR) may seem overly restrictive and essentially useless because it assumes that the operator is driving the system to zero-state and hence driving the output of the system to zero. This is indeed correct. However the problem of driving the output to a desired nonzero level can be solved ''after'' the zero output one is. In fact, it can be proved that this secondary LQR problem can be solved in a very straightforward manner.  It has been shown in classical optimal control theory that the LQ (or LQR) optimal control has the feedback form\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{u}(t)=-\\mathbf{K}(t)\\mathbf{x}(t)</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathbf{K}(t)</math> is a properly dimensioned matrix, given as\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{K}(t)=\\mathbf{R}^{-1}\\mathbf{B}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{S}(t),</math>\n\nand <math>\\mathbf{S}(t)</math> is the solution of the differential [[Riccati equation]].  The differential Riccati equation is given as\n\n:<math>\\dot{\\mathbf{S}}(t) = -\\mathbf{S}(t)\\mathbf{A}-\\mathbf{A}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{S}(t)+\\mathbf{S}(t)\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{R}^{-1}\\mathbf{B}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{S}(t)-\\mathbf{Q}</math>\n\nFor the finite horizon LQ problem, the Riccati equation is integrated backward in time using the terminal boundary condition\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{S}(t_f) = \\mathbf{S}_f</math>\n\nFor the infinite horizon LQR problem, the differential Riccati equation is replaced with the ''algebraic'' Riccati equation (ARE) given as\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{0} = -\\mathbf{S}\\mathbf{A}-\\mathbf{A}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{S}+\\mathbf{S}\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{R}^{-1}\\mathbf{B}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{S}-\\mathbf{Q}</math>\n\nUnderstanding that the ARE arises from infinite horizon problem, the matrices <math>\\mathbf{A}</math>, <math>\\mathbf{B}</math>, <math>\\mathbf{Q}</math>, and <math>\\mathbf{R}</math> are all ''constant''.  It is noted that there are in general multiple solutions to the algebraic Riccati equation and the ''positive definite'' (or positive semi-definite) solution is the one that is used to compute the feedback gain.  The LQ (LQR) problem was elegantly solved by [[Rudolf Kalman]].<ref>Kalman, Rudolf. ''A new approach to linear filtering and prediction problems''. Transactions of the ASME, Journal of Basic Engineering, 82:34\u201345, 1960</ref>\n\n==Numerical methods for optimal control==\nOptimal control problems are generally nonlinear and therefore, generally do not have analytic solutions (e.g., like the linear-quadratic optimal control problem).  As a result, it is necessary to employ numerical methods to solve optimal control problems.  In the early years of optimal control ({{abbr|c.|circa}} 1950s to 1980s) the favored approach for solving optimal control problems was that of ''indirect methods''.  In an indirect method, the calculus of variations is employed to obtain the first-order optimality conditions.  These conditions result in a two-point (or, in the case of a complex problem, a multi-point) [[boundary-value problem]].  This boundary-value problem actually has a special structure because it arises from taking the derivative of a [[Hamiltonian (control theory)|Hamiltonian]].  Thus, the resulting [[dynamical system]] is a [[Hamiltonian system]] of the form\n\n: <math>\\begin{array}{lcl} \\dot{\\textbf{x}} & = & \\partial H/\\partial\\boldsymbol{\\lambda} \\\\ \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}} & = & -\\partial H/\\partial\\textbf{x} \\end{array}</math>\n\nwhere\n\n: <math>H=\\mathcal{L}+\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\textbf{a}-\\boldsymbol{\\mu}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\textbf{b}</math>\n\nis the ''augmented Hamiltonian'' and in an indirect method, the boundary-value problem is solved (using the appropriate boundary or ''transversality'' conditions).  The beauty of using an indirect method is that the state and adjoint (i.e., <math>\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}</math>) are solved for and the resulting solution is readily verified to be an extremal trajectory.  The disadvantage of indirect methods is that the boundary-value problem is often extremely difficult to solve (particularly for problems that span large time intervals or problems with interior point constraints).   A well-known software program that implements indirect methods is BNDSCO.<ref>Oberle, H. J. and Grimm, W., \"BNDSCO-A Program for the Numerical Solution of Optimal Control Problems,\" Institute for Flight Systems Dynamics, DLR, Oberpfaffenhofen, 1989</ref>\n\nThe approach that has risen to prominence in numerical optimal control since the 1980s is that of so-called ''direct methods''.  In a direct method, the state and/or control are approximated using an appropriate function approximation (e.g., polynomial approximation or piecewise constant parameterization).  Simultaneously, the cost functional is approximated as a ''cost function''.  Then, the coefficients of the function approximations are treated as optimization variables and the problem is \"transcribed\" to a nonlinear optimization problem of the form:\n\nMinimize\n\n: <math> F(\\textbf{z})\\,</math>\n\nsubject to the algebraic constraints\n\n: <math> \\begin{array}{lcl} \\textbf{g}(\\textbf{z}) & = & \\textbf{0} \\\\ \\textbf{h}(\\textbf{z}) & \\leq & \\textbf{0} \\end{array} </math>\n\nDepending upon the type of direct method employed, the size of the nonlinear optimization problem can be quite small (e.g., as in a direct shooting or quasilinearization method), moderate (e.g. [[pseudospectral optimal control]]<ref name=\"ReviewPOC\">{{cite journal |authorlink=I. Michael Ross |first=I. M. |last=Ross |first2=M. |last2=Karpenko |title=A Review of Pseudospectral Optimal Control: From Theory to Flight |journal=Annual Reviews in Control |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=182\u2013197 |year=2012 |doi=10.1016/j.arcontrol.2012.09.002 |title-link=Pseudospectral optimal control }}</ref>) or may be quite large (e.g., a direct [[collocation method]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Betts |first=J. T. |title=Practical Methods for Optimal Control Using Nonlinear Programming |publisher=SIAM Press |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |edition=2nd |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-89871-688-7 }}</ref>). In the latter case (i.e., a collocation method), the nonlinear optimization problem may be literally thousands to tens of thousands of variables and constraints. Given the size of many NLPs arising from a direct method, it may appear somewhat counter-intuitive that solving the nonlinear optimization problem is easier than solving the boundary-value problem. It is, however, the fact that the NLP is easier to solve than the boundary-value problem. The reason for the relative ease of computation, particularly of a direct collocation method, is that the NLP is ''sparse'' and many well-known software programs exist (e.g., [[SNOPT]]<ref>Gill, P. E., Murray, W. M., and Saunders, M. A., ''User's Manual for SNOPT Version 7: Software for Large-Scale Nonlinear Programming'', University of California, San Diego Report, 24 April 2007</ref>) to solve large sparse NLPs. As a result, the range of problems that can be solved via direct methods (particularly direct ''collocation methods'' which are very popular these days) is significantly larger than the range of problems that can be solved via indirect methods. In fact, direct methods have become so popular these days that many people have written elaborate software programs that employ these methods. In particular, many such programs include ''DIRCOL'',<ref>von Stryk, O., ''User's Guide for DIRCOL (version 2.1): A Direct Collocation Method for the Numerical Solution of Optimal Control Problems'', Fachgebiet Simulation und Systemoptimierung (SIM), Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt (2000, Version of November 1999).</ref> SOCS,<ref>Betts, J.T. and Huffman, W.

Bishop Blvd Ste E, Pullman, WA 99163, USA: Tomlab Optimization, Inc.</ref> These software tools have increased significantly the opportunity for people to explore complex optimal control problems both for academic research and industrial problems. Finally, it is noted that general-purpose MATLAB optimization environments such as [[TOMLAB]] have made coding complex optimal control problems significantly easier than was previously possible in languages such as C and [[FORTRAN]].\n\n==Discrete-time optimal control==\nThe examples thus far have shown [[continuous time]] systems and control solutions. In fact, as optimal control solutions are now often implemented [[Digital data|digital]]ly, contemporary control theory is now primarily concerned with [[discrete time]] systems and solutions.  The Theory of [[Consistent Approximations]]<ref>E. Polak, ''On the use of consistent approximations in the solution of semi-infinite optimization and optimal control problems'' Math. Prog. 62 pp. 385\u2013415 (1993).</ref> provides conditions under which solutions to a series of increasingly accurate discretized optimal control problem converge to the solution of the original, continuous-time problem.  Not all discretization methods have this property, even seemingly obvious ones.  For instance, using a variable step-size routine to integrate the problem's dynamic equations may generate a gradient which does not converge to zero (or point in the right direction) as the solution is approached.   The direct method ''[http://www.schwartz-home.com/RIOTS RIOTS]'' is based on the Theory of Consistent Approximation.\n\n==Examples==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}\nA common solution strategy in many optimal control problems is to solve for the costate (sometimes called the [[shadow price]]) <math>\\lambda(t)</math>. The costate summarizes in one number the marginal value of expanding or contracting the state variable next turn. The marginal value is not only the gains accruing to it next turn but associated with the duration of the program. It is nice when <math>\\lambda(t)</math> can be solved analytically, but usually, the most one can do is describe it sufficiently well that the intuition can grasp the character of the solution and an equation solver can solve numerically for the values.\n\nHaving obtained <math>\\lambda(t)</math>, the turn-t optimal value for the control can usually be solved as a differential equation conditional on knowledge of <math>\\lambda(t)</math>. Again it is infrequent, especially in continuous-time problems, that one obtains the value of the control or the state explicitly. Usually, the strategy is to solve for thresholds and regions that characterize the optimal control and use a numerical solver to isolate the actual choice values in time.\n\n===Finite time===\n{{confusing|section|small=left|reason=the law of evolution mentioned in the example is not mentioned in the article and is probably not the same as [[evolution]]|date=October 2018}}\nConsider the problem of a mine owner who must decide at what rate to extract ore from their mine.

A control problem includes a [[cost functional]] that is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of state and control variables. An '''optimal control''' is a set of [[differential equation]]s describing the paths of the control variables that minimize the cost function. The optimal control can be derived using [[Pontryagin's maximum principle]] (a [[necessary condition]] also known as Pontryagin's minimum principle or simply Pontryagin's Principle),<ref>{{cite book |first=I. M. |last=Ross |authorlink=I. Michael Ross |year=2009 |title=A Primer on Pontryagin's Principle in Optimal Control |location= |publisher=Collegiate Publishers |isbn=978-0-9843571-0-9 }}</ref> or by solving the [[Hamilton\u2013Jacobi\u2013Bellman equation]] (a [[sufficient condition]]).\n\nWe begin with a simple example. Consider a car traveling in a straight line on a hilly road. The question is, how should the driver press the accelerator pedal in order to ''minimize'' the total traveling time? In this example, the term ''control law'' refers specifically to the way in which the driver presses the accelerator and shifts the gears. The ''system'' consists of both the car and the road, and the ''optimality criterion'' is the minimization of the total traveling time. Control problems usually include ancillary [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraint]]s. For example, the amount of available fuel might be limited, the accelerator pedal cannot be pushed through the floor of the car, speed limits, etc.\n\nA proper cost function will be a mathematical expression giving the traveling time as a function of the speed, geometrical considerations, and [[initial condition]]s of the system. [[constraint (mathematics)|Constraint]]s are often interchangeable with the cost function.\n\nAnother related optimal control problem may be to find the way to drive the car so as to minimize its fuel consumption, given that it must complete a given course in a time not exceeding some amount. Yet another related control problem may be to minimize the total monetary cost of completing the trip, given assumed monetary prices for time and fuel.\n\nA more abstract framework goes as follows.  Minimize the continuous-time cost functional\n\n:<math>J=\\Phi\\,[\\,\\textbf{x}(t_0),t_0,\\textbf{x}(t_f),t_f\\,] + \\int\\limits_{t_0}^{t_f} \\mathcal{L}\\,[\\,\\textbf{x}(t),\\textbf{u}(t),t\\,] \\,\\operatorname{d}t</math>\n\nsubject to the first-order dynamic constraints (the '''state equation''')\n\n:<math> \\dot{\\textbf{x}}(t) = \\textbf{a}\\,[\\,\\textbf{x}(t),\\textbf{u}(t),t\\,],</math>\n\nthe algebraic ''path constraints''\n\n:<math> \\textbf{b}\\,[\\,\\textbf{x}(t),\\textbf{u}(t),t\\,] \\leq \\textbf{0},</math>\n\nand the [[boundary condition]]s\n\n:<math>\\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\,[\\,\\textbf{x}(t_0),t_0,\\textbf{x}(t_f),t_f\\,] = 0</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\textbf{x}(t)</math> is the ''state'', <math>\\textbf{u}(t)</math> is the ''control'', <math>t</math> is the independent variable (generally speaking, time), <math>t_0</math> is the initial time, and <math>t_f</math> is the terminal time.  The terms <math>\\Phi</math> and <math>\\mathcal{L}</math> are called the ''endpoint cost '' and ''[[Lagrange multiplier|Lagrangian]]'', respectively.  Furthermore, it is noted that the path constraints are in general ''inequality'' constraints and thus may not be active (i.e., equal to zero) at the optimal solution.  It is also noted that the optimal control problem as stated above may have multiple solutions (i.e., the solution may not be unique).  Thus, it is most often the case that any solution <math>[\\textbf{x}^*(t^*),\\textbf{u}^*(t^*),t^*]</math> to the optimal control problem is ''locally minimizing''.\n\n==Linear quadratic control==\nA special case of the general nonlinear optimal control problem given in the previous section is the [[Linear-quadratic regulator|''linear quadratic'' (LQ) optimal control problem]].  The LQ problem is stated as follows.  Minimize the ''quadratic'' continuous-time cost functional\n\n:<math>J=\\tfrac{1}{2} \\mathbf{x}^{\\mathsf{T}}(t_f)\\mathbf{S}_f\\mathbf{x}(t_f) + \\tfrac{1}{2} \\int_{t_0}\\limits^{t_f} [\\,\\mathbf{x}^{\\mathsf{T}}(t)\\mathbf{Q}(t)\\mathbf{x}(t) + \\mathbf{u}^{\\mathsf{T}}(t)\\mathbf{R}(t)\\mathbf{u}(t)\\,]\\, \\operatorname{d}t</math>\n\nSubject to the ''linear'' first-order dynamic constraints\n\n:<math>\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}(t)=\\mathbf{A}(t) \\mathbf{x}(t) + \\mathbf{B}(t) \\mathbf{u}(t), </math>\n\nand the initial condition\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{x}(t_0) = \\mathbf{x}_0</math>\n\nA particular form of the LQ problem that arises in many control system problems is that of the ''linear quadratic regulator'' (LQR) where all of the matrices (i.e., <math>\\mathbf{A}</math>, <math>\\mathbf{B}</math>, <math>\\mathbf{Q}</math>, and <math>\\mathbf{R}</math>) are ''constant'', the initial time is arbitrarily set to zero, and the terminal time is taken in the limit <math>t_f\\rightarrow\\infty</math> (this last assumption is what is known as ''infinite horizon'').  The LQR problem is stated as follows.  Minimize the infinite horizon quadratic continuous-time cost functional\n\n:<math>J=\\tfrac{1}{2} \\int\\limits_{0}^{\\infty}[\\,\\mathbf{x}^{\\mathsf{T}}(t)\\mathbf{Q}\\mathbf{x}(t) + \\mathbf{u}^{\\mathsf{T}}(t)\\mathbf{R}\\mathbf{u}(t)\\,]\\, \\operatorname{d}t</math>\n\nSubject to the ''linear time-invariant'' first-order dynamic constraints\n\n:<math>\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}(t)=\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{x}(t) + \\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{u}(t), </math>\n\nand the initial condition\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{x}(t_0) = \\mathbf{x}_0</math>\n\nIn the finite-horizon case the matrices are restricted in that <math>\\mathbf{Q}</math> and <math>\\mathbf{R}</math> are positive semi-definite and positive definite, respectively.  In the infinite-horizon case, however, the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] <math>\\mathbf{Q}</math> and <math>\\mathbf{R}</math> are not only positive-semidefinite and positive-definite, respectively, but are also ''constant''.  These additional restrictions on\n<math>\\mathbf{Q}</math> and <math>\\mathbf{R}</math> in the infinite-horizon case are enforced to ensure that the cost functional remains positive.  Furthermore, in order to ensure that the cost function is ''bounded'', the additional restriction is imposed that the pair <math>(\\mathbf{A},\\mathbf{B})</math> is ''[[Controllability|controllable]]''.  Note that the LQ or LQR cost functional can be thought of physically as attempting to minimize the ''control energy'' (measured as a quadratic form).\n\nThe infinite horizon problem (i.e., LQR) may seem overly restrictive and essentially useless because it assumes that the operator is driving the system to zero-state and hence driving the output of the system to zero. This is indeed correct. However the problem of driving the output to a desired nonzero level can be solved ''after'' the zero output one is. In fact, it can be proved that this secondary LQR problem can be solved in a very straightforward manner.  It has been shown in classical optimal control theory that the LQ (or LQR) optimal control has the feedback form\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{u}(t)=-\\mathbf{K}(t)\\mathbf{x}(t)</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathbf{K}(t)</math> is a properly dimensioned matrix, given as\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{K}(t)=\\mathbf{R}^{-1}\\mathbf{B}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{S}(t),</math>\n\nand <math>\\mathbf{S}(t)</math> is the solution of the differential [[Riccati equation]].  The differential Riccati equation is given as\n\n:<math>\\dot{\\mathbf{S}}(t) = -\\mathbf{S}(t)\\mathbf{A}-\\mathbf{A}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{S}(t)+\\mathbf{S}(t)\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{R}^{-1}\\mathbf{B}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{S}(t)-\\mathbf{Q}</math>\n\nFor the finite horizon LQ problem, the Riccati equation is integrated backward in time using the terminal boundary condition\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{S}(t_f) = \\mathbf{S}_f</math>\n\nFor the infinite horizon LQR problem, the differential Riccati equation is replaced with the ''algebraic'' Riccati equation (ARE) given as\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{0} = -\\mathbf{S}\\mathbf{A}-\\mathbf{A}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{S}+\\mathbf{S}\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{R}^{-1}\\mathbf{B}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{S}-\\mathbf{Q}</math>\n\nUnderstanding that the ARE arises from infinite horizon problem, the matrices <math>\\mathbf{A}</math>, <math>\\mathbf{B}</math>, <math>\\mathbf{Q}</math>, and <math>\\mathbf{R}</math> are all ''constant''.  It is noted that there are in general multiple solutions to the algebraic Riccati equation and the ''positive definite'' (or positive semi-definite) solution is the one that is used to compute the feedback gain.  The LQ (LQR) problem was elegantly solved by [[Rudolf Kalman]].<ref>Kalman, Rudolf. ''A new approach to linear filtering and prediction problems''. Transactions of the ASME, Journal of Basic Engineering, 82:34\u201345, 1960</ref>\n\n==Numerical methods for optimal control==\nOptimal control problems are generally nonlinear and therefore, generally do not have analytic solutions (e.g., like the linear-quadratic optimal control problem).  As a result, it is necessary to employ numerical methods to solve optimal control problems.  In the early years of optimal control ({{abbr|c.|circa}} 1950s to 1980s) the favored approach for solving optimal control problems was that of ''indirect methods''.  In an indirect method, the calculus of variations is employed to obtain the first-order optimality conditions.  These conditions result in a two-point (or, in the case of a complex problem, a multi-point) [[boundary-value problem]].  This boundary-value problem actually has a special structure because it arises from taking the derivative of a [[Hamiltonian (control theory)|Hamiltonian]].  Thus, the resulting [[dynamical system]] is a [[Hamiltonian system]] of the form\n\n: <math>\\begin{array}{lcl} \\dot{\\textbf{x}} & = & \\partial H/\\partial\\boldsymbol{\\lambda} \\\\ \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}} & = & -\\partial H/\\partial\\textbf{x} \\end{array}</math>\n\nwhere\n\n: <math>H=\\mathcal{L}+\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\textbf{a}-\\boldsymbol{\\mu}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\textbf{b}</math>\n\nis the ''augmented Hamiltonian'' and in an indirect method, the boundary-value problem is solved (using the appropriate boundary or ''transversality'' conditions).  The beauty of using an indirect method is that the state and adjoint (i.e., <math>\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}</math>) are solved for and the resulting solution is readily verified to be an extremal trajectory.  The disadvantage of indirect methods is that the boundary-value problem is often extremely difficult to solve (particularly for problems that span large time intervals or problems with interior point constraints).   A well-known software program that implements indirect methods is BNDSCO.<ref>Oberle, H. J. and Grimm, W., \"BNDSCO-A Program for the Numerical Solution of Optimal Control Problems,\" Institute for Flight Systems Dynamics, DLR, Oberpfaffenhofen, 1989</ref>\n\nThe approach that has risen to prominence in numerical optimal control since the 1980s is that of so-called ''direct methods''.  In a direct method, the state and/or control are approximated using an appropriate function approximation (e.g., polynomial approximation or piecewise constant parameterization).  Simultaneously, the cost functional is approximated as a ''cost function''.  Then, the coefficients of the function approximations are treated as optimization variables and the problem is \"transcribed\" to a nonlinear optimization problem of the form:\n\nMinimize\n\n: <math> F(\\textbf{z})\\,</math>\n\nsubject to the algebraic constraints\n\n: <math> \\begin{array}{lcl} \\textbf{g}(\\textbf{z}) & = & \\textbf{0} \\\\ \\textbf{h}(\\textbf{z}) & \\leq & \\textbf{0} \\end{array} </math>\n\nDepending upon the type of direct method employed, the size of the nonlinear optimization problem can be quite small (e.g., as in a direct shooting or quasilinearization method), moderate (e.g. [[pseudospectral optimal control]]<ref name=\"ReviewPOC\">{{cite journal |authorlink=I. Michael Ross |first=I. M. |last=Ross |first2=M. |last2=Karpenko |title=A Review of Pseudospectral Optimal Control: From Theory to Flight |journal=Annual Reviews in Control |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=182\u2013197 |year=2012 |doi=10.1016/j.arcontrol.2012.09.002 |title-link=Pseudospectral optimal control }}</ref>) or may be quite large (e.g., a direct [[collocation method]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Betts |first=J. T. |title=Practical Methods for Optimal Control Using Nonlinear Programming |publisher=SIAM Press |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |edition=2nd |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-89871-688-7 }}</ref>). In the latter case (i.e., a collocation method), the nonlinear optimization problem may be literally thousands to tens of thousands of variables and constraints. Given the size of many NLPs arising from a direct method, it may appear somewhat counter-intuitive that solving the nonlinear optimization problem is easier than solving the boundary-value problem. It is, however, the fact that the NLP is easier to solve than the boundary-value problem. The reason for the relative ease of computation, particularly of a direct collocation method, is that the NLP is ''sparse'' and many well-known software programs exist (e.g., [[SNOPT]]<ref>Gill, P. E., Murray, W. M., and Saunders, M. A., ''User's Manual for SNOPT Version 7: Software for Large-Scale Nonlinear Programming'', University of California, San Diego Report, 24 April 2007</ref>) to solve large sparse NLPs. As a result, the range of problems that can be solved via direct methods (particularly direct ''collocation methods'' which are very popular these days) is significantly larger than the range of problems that can be solved via indirect methods. In fact, direct methods have become so popular these days that many people have written elaborate software programs that employ these methods. In particular, many such programs include ''DIRCOL'',<ref>von Stryk, O., ''User's Guide for DIRCOL (version 2.1): A Direct Collocation Method for the Numerical Solution of Optimal Control Problems'', Fachgebiet Simulation und Systemoptimierung (SIM), Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt (2000, Version of November 1999).</ref> SOCS,<ref>Betts, J.T. and Huffman, W.

Finally, it is noted that general-purpose MATLAB optimization environments such as [[TOMLAB]] have made coding complex optimal control problems significantly easier than was previously possible in languages such as C and [[FORTRAN]].\n\n==Discrete-time optimal control==\nThe examples thus far have shown [[continuous time]] systems and control solutions. In fact, as optimal control solutions are now often implemented [[Digital data|digital]]ly, contemporary control theory is now primarily concerned with [[discrete time]] systems and solutions.  The Theory of [[Consistent Approximations]]<ref>E. Polak, ''On the use of consistent approximations in the solution of semi-infinite optimization and optimal control problems'' Math. Prog. 62 pp. 385\u2013415 (1993).</ref> provides conditions under which solutions to a series of increasingly accurate discretized optimal control problem converge to the solution of the original, continuous-time problem.  Not all discretization methods have this property, even seemingly obvious ones.  For instance, using a variable step-size routine to integrate the problem's dynamic equations may generate a gradient which does not converge to zero (or point in the right direction) as the solution is approached.   The direct method ''[http://www.schwartz-home.com/RIOTS RIOTS]'' is based on the Theory of Consistent Approximation.\n\n==Examples==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}\nA common solution strategy in many optimal control problems is to solve for the costate (sometimes called the [[shadow price]]) <math>\\lambda(t)</math>. The costate summarizes in one number the marginal value of expanding or contracting the state variable next turn. The marginal value is not only the gains accruing to it next turn but associated with the duration of the program. It is nice when <math>\\lambda(t)</math> can be solved analytically, but usually, the most one can do is describe it sufficiently well that the intuition can grasp the character of the solution and an equation solver can solve numerically for the values.\n\nHaving obtained <math>\\lambda(t)</math>, the turn-t optimal value for the control can usually be solved as a differential equation conditional on knowledge of <math>\\lambda(t)</math>. Again it is infrequent, especially in continuous-time problems, that one obtains the value of the control or the state explicitly. Usually, the strategy is to solve for thresholds and regions that characterize the optimal control and use a numerical solver to isolate the actual choice values in time.\n\n===Finite time===\n{{confusing|section|small=left|reason=the law of evolution mentioned in the example is not mentioned in the article and is probably not the same as [[evolution]]|date=October 2018}}\nConsider the problem of a mine owner who must decide at what rate to extract ore from their mine.
