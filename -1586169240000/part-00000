It was produced by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and directed by [[Tex Avery]]. The canary in this short was a primary inspiration for Maurice, a character from ''[[The Wacky World of Tex Avery]]''.\n\n== Plot ==\nAn unnamed alley [[cat]] searches for food in some garbage cans late at night. Unable to find anything worth his while (the bones he finds are stolen by other alley cats before he can take a bite) he spots a [[refrigerator]] inside a house and heads for it. He sneaks onto the property only to wake a sleeping [[bulldog]].  The bulldog chases the cat up to the side of the house. The cat quickly pulls out some [[Hypnotic|sleeping pills]], putting the dog into a deep sleep.\n\nOnce inside the cat searches for food in the [[kitchen]], but comes up empty. His luck finally changes when he finds a can of cat food. He quickly opens the can and out of the can pops a [[mouse]] who is plopped down onto a dinner plate. The cat is about to dig in with a fork but the mouse puts a quick stop to that. He says that the cat can't eat him because he has [[Metafiction|already seen the cartoon they are in]] and that he winds up saving the cat's life later. The feline understands but wants some food as he is starving. The mouse points into the other room and tells him that there is a huge, fat, tasty [[Domestic Canary|canary]] in there. The cat charges out into the other room and stuffs the unseen canary into a sack heading back to the kitchen.\n\nThe bird is emptied from the sack, to be revealed as scrawny and little. The bird tells the cat, \"Well, I've been sick...\"  Disgusted with the tiny creature at first but still desperate, the cat gets a (literal) brainstorm when he sees a bottle of Jumbo-Gro plant growth formula on the shelf. Quickly he pours some of the formula into the bird and sure enough, the canary grows rapidly in size. But before the cat can take a bite, the bird is already over 10 feet tall. The canary takes advantage of his new height and beats up on the cat. The cat turns the tables on the bird and drinks the Jumbo-Gro formula himself, doubling in size until he is much bigger than the bird. He tosses the potion out of the window only for it to land in the bulldog's mouth. While the now giant-sized cat chases the slightly smaller canary through the side of the house, the bulldog guzzles down the formula. After a quick run around the block, the cat and canary wind up back outside of the house, where a now gigantic bulldog appears before them. The cat runs away in fear as the bulldog tosses the bottle of plant growth food down the chimney, where it rolls out of the fireplace and straight to the mouse inside the house. The dog leaps over the house and chases the cat into the city.\n\nThe mouse in the house takes a few sips of plant food, instantly ballooning to gigantic size. The dog chases the cat to the city, only for the now gargantuan mouse to show up and scare the bulldog away with a simple \"Boo!\". The mouse who is as tall as a 20-story building and just as fat, reminds the cat that he told him he would save his life. The cat thanks him as the mouse hands him the bottle back and waddles off. The cat, rubs his enormous belly realizing he still is hungry, sees the huge mouse stomping off and gets another idea. He suddenly drinks more of the formula and grows even bigger and fatter than the mouse. The cat who is by now 100 stories tall, chases the giant but smaller mouse through the city and across the country, passing the [[Grand Canyon]], [[Hoover Dam]] and the mountains.\n\nThe giant mouse hides in a railroad tunnel, losing the cat for a moment.  The mouse drinks the potion when the cat isn't paying attention and becomes even bigger than the already huge cat. The mouse starts to beat up on the cat only for the cat to take the potion back and drink it, becoming bigger than the mouse. The mouse takes it back and drinks more to become bigger still. They continue getting bigger and bigger, fatter and fatter until they suddenly both come to a stop at the same exact size. They shake the now empty bottle of Jumbo-Gro and tell the audience at home that they have to end the cartoon, as they've run out of the formula. They wave goodbye to the audience before the camera pulls back, revealing that they have outgrown the [[Earth]] itself and are standing atop the globe.\n\n==Production==\n* Directed by: Tex Avery\n* Animation: Ray Abrams, Robert Bentley, Walt Clinton\n* Story: Heck Allen\n* Music: Scott Bradley\n* Produced by: Fred Quimby\n\n==Reception ==\nIn 1994, it was voted #10 of the [[50 Greatest Cartoons]] of all time by members of the animation field.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Beck |first1=Jerry |title=The 50 Greatest Cartoons: As Selected by 1,000 Animation Professionals |date=1994 |publisher=Turner Publishing |isbn=978-1878685490}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n[[The Simpsons]] episode \"[[Itchy and Scratchy and Marge]]\" reproduces the climax, with Itchy and Scratchy shooting each other with ever-larger handguns.\n\n\"Planet of the Capes\", an episode of ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'', has the hero and the villain repeat the final sequence with an energy gun that makes them grow. At the end, the villain rebuilds the gun to work in reverse, and Darkwing Duck makes him shoots himself, leaving him to stand on the planet alone.\n\nThe episode of [[Dexter's Laboratory]] 'Monstory' parodies the short, in which Dexter and DeeDee repeatedly drink a formula that transforms them into increasingly giant monsters.  Like the Avery short, the episode ends with both Dexter and DeeDee on top of the globe.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{IMDb title|0039535}}\n*[http://www.bcdb.com/bcdb/detailed.cgi?film=3099 ''King-Size Canary''] on [[Big Cartoon DataBase]]\n\n[[Category:1947 films]]\n[[Category:1947 animated films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Tex Avery]]\n[[Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer short films]]\n[[Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer animated short films]]\n[[Category:American animated short films]]\n[[Category:1940s American animated films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Scott Bradley]]\n[[Category:Fiction about size change]]\n[[Category:Animated films about cats]]\n[[Category:Animated films about birds]]\n[[Category:Animated films about dogs]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox Hollywood cartoon\n| name   = King-Size Canary\n| image          = Kingsizecanary.jpg\n| caption        = Original title card for ''King-Size Canary''\n| director       = [[Tex Avery]]\n| story   = [[Heck Allen]]\n| animator       = [[Ray Abrams (animator)|Ray Abrams]]<br>[[Robert Bentley (animator)|Robert Bentley]]<br>[[Walt Clinton]]\n| starring    = [[Frank Graham (voice actor)|Frank Graham]] (as Mouse; uncredited)<br>[[Pinto Colvig]] (as Cat; uncredited)<br>[[Sara Berner]] (as Canary; uncredited)\n| music       = [[Scott Bradley (composer)|Scott Bradley]]\n| producer       = [[Fred Quimby]]\n| studio         = [[MGM Cartoons]]\n| distributor    = [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n| released   = December 6, 1947\n| color_process  = [[Technicolor]]\n| runtime        = 7:55\n| language = English\n}}\n\n'''''King-Size Canary''''' is an [[animated cartoon]] short that debuted in movie theaters in 1947.

At the end, the villain rebuilds the gun to work in reverse, and Darkwing Duck makes him shoots himself, leaving him to stand on the planet alone.\n\nThe episode of [[Dexter's Laboratory]] 'Monstory' parodies the short, in which Dexter and DeeDee repeatedly drink a formula that transforms them into increasingly giant monsters.  Like the Avery short, the episode ends with both Dexter and DeeDee on top of the globe.\n\n== External links ==\n*{{IMDb title|0039535}}\n*[http://www.bcdb.com/bcdb/detailed.cgi?film=3099 ''King-Size Canary''] on [[Big Cartoon DataBase]]\n\n[[Category:1947 films]]\n[[Category:1947 animated films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Tex Avery]]\n[[Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer short films]]\n[[Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer animated short films]]\n[[Category:American animated short films]]\n[[Category:1940s American animated films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Scott Bradley]]\n[[Category:Fiction about size change]]\n[[Category:Animated films about cats]]\n[[Category:Animated films about birds]]\n[[Category:Animated films about dogs]]\n", "name_user": "G\u00fcnniX", "label": "safe", "comment": "Reflist", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King-Size_Canary"}
