Scully is an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] [[special agent|agent]] and a medical doctor ([[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]]), partnered with fellow Special Agent [[Fox Mulder]] for the first seven, and the tenth and eleventh seasons, and with [[John Doggett]] in the eighth and ninth seasons. In the television series, they work out of a cramped basement office at [[J. Edgar Hoover Building|FBI headquarters]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] to investigate unsolved cases labeled \"[[X-File]]s\". In 2002, Scully left government employment, and in 2008 she began working as a surgeon in ''Our Lady of Sorrows'', a private [[Catholic]] hospital \u2013 where she stayed for seven years, until rejoining the FBI. In contrast to Mulder's credulous \"believer\" character, Scully is the skeptic for the first seven seasons, choosing to base her beliefs on what science can prove. She later on becomes a \"believer\" after [[Colonist (The X-Files)|Mulder's abduction]] at the end of season seven.\n\nScully has appeared in all but five episodes of ''The X-Files'', and in the [[20th Century Fox]] films ''[[The X-Files (film)|The X-Files]]'', released in 1998, and ''[[The X-Files: I Want to Believe]]'', released ten years later. The episodes she does not appear in are \"[[3 (The X-Files)|3]]\", \"[[Zero Sum (The X-Files)|Zero Sum]]\", \"[[Unusual Suspects (The X-Files)|Unusual Suspects]]\" and \"[[Travelers (The X-Files)|Travelers]]\" plus \"[[The Gift (The X-Files)|The Gift]]\" (excluding archive footage). The [[The X-Files (season 11)|eleventh season]] marked Anderson's final time portraying the character.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/gillian-anderson-confirms-the-x-files-exit/|title=Gillian Anderson Confirms She's Leaving The X-Files|last=MacDonald|first=Lindsay|date=January 10, 2018|work=[[TV Guide]]|access-date=January 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nDana Katherine Scully was born on February 23, 1964 in [[Annapolis, Maryland]], to [[List of The X-Files characters#William Scully|William]] ([[Don S.

In the season five episode \"[[Emily (The X-Files)|Emily]]\", Scully discovers that she unknowingly mothered a daughter during her abduction (in season 2). Her daughter Emily was adopted by another family. Emily died shortly afterwards, and they were unable to further investigate after Emily's body went missing.

Early on in the film Scully is contacted by the FBI who are looking for Fox Mulder in the hope that he will assist them with the investigation of a missing FBI agent. In exchange for his help the charges against him will be dropped. Unlike Mulder, Scully was apparently not considered a fugitive by the FBI. However, she did continue to maintain her romantic relationship with Mulder throughout the six years that he was on the run from the American government.

Scully almost always wears a gold [[cross necklace]], given to her by her mother as a Christmas present when she was fifteen. When she was abducted by Duane Barry, a self-proclaimed alien abductee,<ref name=\"Ascension\"/> it was the only item left behind in Barry's getaway car. Mulder wore it as a talisman of her until Scully miraculously reappeared in a [[Washington, D.C.]] hospital.<ref>{{cite episode| episodelink=3 (The X-Files) | title=3 | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[David Nutter]] (director); Chris Ruppenthal, [[Glen Morgan]] & [[James Wong (producer)|James Wong]] (writers) | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] | season = 2 | number = 7}}</ref> After she recovered from the trauma of her abduction, he returned the cross to her.<ref name=\"One Breath\"/>\n\nThe abduction visibly tested the limits of her faith \u2014 Mulder believes that Scully was taken aboard an alien spaceship and was subjected to tests. However, because of Scully's skepticism, she believes she was kidnapped by men and subjected to tests, not aliens. She believes she could have been brought there by Barry, and she began to exhibit symptoms of [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] on a case involving a murdering [[fetishist]] named Donnie Pfaster.<ref>{{cite episode| episodelink=Irresistible (The X-Files) | title=Irresistible | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[David Nutter]] (director); [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] (writer) | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] | season = 2 | number = 13}}</ref> This psychological [[re-victimization]] continued after Pfaster escaped from prison five years later and again attempted to kill her in her home, ending only after she fatally shot him. She struggled with what motivated her actions to kill Pfaster, and questioned whether it was God compelling her to kill him, or \"something else\".<ref>{{cite episode| episodelink=Orison (The X-Files) | title=Orison | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[Rob Bowman (filmmaker)|Rob Bowman]] (director); [[Chip Johannessen]] (writer) | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] | season = 7 | number = 7}}</ref>\n\nSometime after her recovery from cancer, Scully began to regularly attend [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] again. At the request of [[List of The X-Files characters#Father McCue|Father McCue]], Scully got involved in a case concerning a [[paraplegic]] girl who was found dead in a kneeling position with her palms outstretched and eye sockets charred. After Scully discovered the girl was part of a set of quadruplets and two more were murdered, Father McCue shared with her the story of the [[seraphim]] and the [[nephilim]], which Scully interpreted as a possible explanation for the deformations and deaths of the girls. Scully continued to have visions of Emily, and when the last girl died, Scully believed she was returning the girl to God. Upon her return to Washington D.C., she went to confession to gain peace of mind and acceptance for Emily's death.<ref>{{cite episode| episodelink=All Souls (The X-Files) | title=All Souls| series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[Allen Coulter]] (director); [[Frank Spotnitz]] & John Shiban (writers) | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] | season = 5 | number = 17}}</ref> In confession she regretted her decision of letting the girl go. This suggests Scully had doubts about her faith.\n\nIn the sixth-season episode \"[[Milagro (The X-Files)|Milagro]]\", Agent Scully's vulnerability is exposed. In this episode, the murderer takes the victim's heart out. The suspect, a writer named Phillip Padgett, has a particular interest in Scully and is fascinated by her beauty and personality. When she goes to a church to observe a painting, the writer is there and talks to her about the [[Sacred Heart of Jesus]]. During the conversation he says she visits the church because she likes art, but not as place of worship. Scully doesn't say otherwise and later she says to Agent Mulder the writer told her her life story. All this suggests that Scully isn't a devout Roman Catholic, although she attempted to approach again the Catholic community and the Catholic faith to which she was devout in her youth, after handling the strange case presented in [[Revelations (The X-Files)|\"Revelations\"]] and also after dealing with life-threatening cancer during the [[The X-Files (season 4)|fourth season]].\n\n===Relationships===\nWhile in medical school, she carried on an affair with her married instructor, Dr. Daniel Waterston who may have been the \"college boyfriend\" mentioned in \"[[Trust No 1 (The X-Files)|Trust No 1]]\". It is never indicated in the show whether or not the relationship became sexual. According to Anderson in the episode's audio commentary, Scully came very close to having an affair with the married Waterston but left before she could break up his marriage.

In 1950 the less than credible ''Behind the Flying Saucers'' was published, written by ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' columnist [[Frank Scully]].

Carter had chosen 24-year-old [[Gillian Anderson]], whom Carter felt was perfect for the role.<ref name=\"Lowry 15-17\" /> Of her audition, Carter said, \"she came in and read the part with a seriousness and intensity that I knew the Scully character had to have and I knew [...] she was the right person for the part\".<ref name=\"Pilot Speaks\">{{cite video |people=[[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] (narrator) |title=Chris Carter Speaks about Season One Episodes: Pilot|medium=DVD |publisher=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]}}</ref> However, Fox executives had wanted a more glamorous \"[[Bombshell (sex symbol)|bombshell]]\" for the part (in a 2008 interview Anderson stated that [[Pamela Anderson]] had actually been the network's first choice),<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.rte.ie/entertainment/2008/0724/414071-thexfiles/|title=Pamela Anderson first choice for X-Files role|date=24 July 2008|publisher=|accessdate=10 April 2019|via=www.rte.ie}}</ref> hoping that this would lead to the series involving a romantic element.

She has appeared outside ''The X-Files'' on numerous occasions, the most notable being in the ''[[Millennium (TV series)|Millennium]]'' (also created by Chris Carter) episode \"Lamentation,\" in which the main character, Frank Black, visits the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia, and Mulder and Scully are briefly seen descending a stairway. In fact, they are Duchovny and Anderson's [[stand-in]]s.\n\nAn animated version of Scully, which featured the voice acting of Anderson, would appear on [[The Simpsons (season 8)|season 8]] of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', in the episode \"[[The Springfield Files]]\", as well as Canadian animated series ''[[Eek! The Cat]]'', on the episode \"[[List of Eek! The Cat episodes#Season 4 (1995\u20131996)|Eek Space 9]]\". The animated television series ''[[ReBoot]]'' featured characters Fax Modem and Data Nully, obvious spoofs of Mulder and Scully, in the episode \"[[List of ReBoot episodes#Season 2 (1995\u20131996)|Trust No One]]\".

fiction|supernatural]] television series ''[[The X-Files]]'', played by [[Gillian Anderson]]. Scully is an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] [[special agent|agent]] and a medical doctor ([[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]]), partnered with fellow Special Agent [[Fox Mulder]] for the first seven, and the tenth and eleventh seasons, and with [[John Doggett]] in the eighth and ninth seasons. In the television series, they work out of a cramped basement office at [[J. Edgar Hoover Building|FBI headquarters]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] to investigate unsolved cases labeled \"[[X-File]]s\". In 2002, Scully left government employment, and in 2008 she began working as a surgeon in ''Our Lady of Sorrows'', a private [[Catholic]] hospital \u2013 where she stayed for seven years, until rejoining the FBI. In contrast to Mulder's credulous \"believer\" character, Scully is the skeptic for the first seven seasons, choosing to base her beliefs on what science can prove. She later on becomes a \"believer\" after [[Colonist (The X-Files)|Mulder's abduction]] at the end of season seven.\n\nScully has appeared in all but five episodes of ''The X-Files'', and in the [[20th Century Fox]] films ''[[The X-Files (film)|The X-Files]]'', released in 1998, and ''[[The X-Files: I Want to Believe]]'', released ten years later. The episodes she does not appear in are \"[[3 (The X-Files)|3]]\", \"[[Zero Sum (The X-Files)|Zero Sum]]\", \"[[Unusual Suspects (The X-Files)|Unusual Suspects]]\" and \"[[Travelers (The X-Files)|Travelers]]\" plus \"[[The Gift (The X-Files)|The Gift]]\" (excluding archive footage). The [[The X-Files (season 11)|eleventh season]] marked Anderson's final time portraying the character.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/gillian-anderson-confirms-the-x-files-exit/|title=Gillian Anderson Confirms She's Leaving The X-Files|last=MacDonald|first=Lindsay|date=January 10, 2018|work=[[TV Guide]]|access-date=January 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nDana Katherine Scully was born on February 23, 1964 in [[Annapolis, Maryland]], to [[List of The X-Files characters#William Scully|William]] ([[Don S.

Early on in the film Scully is contacted by the FBI who are looking for Fox Mulder in the hope that he will assist them with the investigation of a missing FBI agent. In exchange for his help the charges against him will be dropped. Unlike Mulder, Scully was apparently not considered a fugitive by the FBI.

Scully continued to have visions of Emily, and when the last girl died, Scully believed she was returning the girl to God. Upon her return to Washington D.C., she went to confession to gain peace of mind and acceptance for Emily's death.<ref>{{cite episode| episodelink=All Souls (The X-Files) | title=All Souls| series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[Allen Coulter]] (director); [[Frank Spotnitz]] & John Shiban (writers) | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] | season = 5 | number = 17}}</ref> In confession she regretted her decision of letting the girl go.

In this episode, the murderer takes the victim's heart out. The suspect, a writer named Phillip Padgett, has a particular interest in Scully and is fascinated by her beauty and personality. When she goes to a church to observe a painting, the writer is there and talks to her about the [[Sacred Heart of Jesus]]. During the conversation he says she visits the church because she likes art, but not as place of worship. Scully doesn't say otherwise and later she says to Agent Mulder the writer told her her life story. All this suggests that Scully isn't a devout Roman Catholic, although she attempted to approach again the Catholic community and the Catholic faith to which she was devout in her youth, after handling the strange case presented in [[Revelations (The X-Files)|\"Revelations\"]] and also after dealing with life-threatening cancer during the [[The X-Files (season 4)|fourth season]].\n\n===Relationships===\nWhile in medical school, she carried on an affair with her married instructor, Dr. Daniel Waterston who may have been the \"college boyfriend\" mentioned in \"[[Trust No 1 (The X-Files)|Trust No 1]]\". It is never indicated in the show whether or not the relationship became sexual.

With time, they came to be known as [[Indian Civil Service]] (ICS). \n\nIn 1947, with India gaining independence, ICS was replaced by Indian Administrative Service (IAS) and the Indian Police (IP) was replaced by Indian Police Service (IPS) and were recognised by the Indian Constitution as All-India Services. \nIn 1963, Indian Forest Service (IFS) was created and it came into existence in 1966. <ref>{{Citation\n| last1  = Laxmikanth\n| first1 = M.\n| title     = Indian Polity\n| publisher = McGraw-Hill Education\n| ISBN = 9352604881\n}}</ref>\n==Power, purpose and responsibilities==\nThe All India Services Act, 1951 empowers the government of India to make, after consultation with state governments, rules for the regulation of recruitment and conditions of service of the persons appointed to an All India Service.

This being the main responsibility, every civil servant is assigned to a particular office which deals with policy matters pertaining to that area. The policy matters are framed, modified, interpreted in this office under the direct supervision of the Administrative Officer in consultation with the Minister. The implementation of policies is also done on the advice of the Officer. The [[Cabinet Secretary]] stands at the top of the government machinery involved in policy making followed by Secretary/Additional Secretary, Joint Secretary, Director, Under Secretary and Junior Scale Officers in that order. These appointments are filled by civil servants according to seniority in the Civil Services. In the process of decision making, a number of officers give their views to the Minister who weighs the matter and makes a decision considering the issue involved.\n\nThe implementation process involves supervision and touring. The allocation of enormous funds to and by the field officers calls for supervision and the officials concerned have to reply to queries made in the Parliament for which they must remain well informed.\n\nThe Civil servant has also to represent the Government in another country or in International forums. At the level of Deputy Secretary, he is even authorized to sign agreements on behalf of the Government.\n\nA civil servant begins his career in the state with two years in probation. This period is spent at training schools, Secretariat, field offices or in a [[District Magistrate]]'s office. He is given the position of Sub-Divisional Magistrate and has to look after the law, order and general administration including developmental work in the area under his charge. After the probation and 2 years of services as a junior scale officer, the officer is put in the senior scale. Then he may function as District Magistrate, Managing Director of a Public Enterprise or Director of a Department. Senior Scale comprises the Senior Time Scale (Joint Secretary), Junior Administrative Grade (Additional Secretary) and the Selection Grade (Special Secretary). Selection Grade is given on promotion after 13 years of regular service. The next promotion within the State is that of a Commissioner-cum-Secretary after 16 years. This promotion also entitles them to the Super Time Scale. Then after 24 years of regular service an IAS officer may be promoted to Above super time scale who is designated as [[Principal Secretary (India)|Principal Secretaries]]/Financial Commissioners in some states\n\nEach State has many Secretaries/Principal Secretaries and only one [[Chief Secretary (India)|Chief Secretary]]. Some appointments of Secretaries are considered more prestigious than others, e.g., the Finance Secretary, Development Commissioners, Home Secretary and hence they enjoy the salary of a Principal Secretary. the Chief Secretary in the State is the top ranking civil servant and may be assisted by Additional Chief Secretaries. In some cadres/States e.g. New Delhi, Financial Commissioner and other high ranking secretaries such as Additional Chief Secretaries enjoy the pay of the Chief Secretary .\n\nIn the District, the administrative head is the [[District collector|Collector]] or Deputy Commissioner or District Magistrate. The DM/Collector/DC handle the affairs of the District including development functions. He necessarily tours all rural sectors inspecting specific projects, disputed sites and looks into the problems of people on the spot also.\n\nAt the divisional level, the Divisional Commissioner is in charge of his division. His role is to oversee law and order and general administration and developmental work. Appeals against the Divisional Commissioner are heard by the Chairman of the Board of Revenue.\n\n===Indian Forest Service (IFS)===\n{{main|Indian Forest Service}}\n\nIndia was one of the first countries in the world to introduce scientific forest management. In 1864, the British Raj established the [[Indian Forest Service#Imperial Forest Service (IFS)|Imperial Forest Department]]. In 1866 Dr. [[Dietrich Brandis]], a German forest officer, was appointed Inspector General of Forests. The Imperial Forestry Service was organized in 1867. \n \nOfficers appointed from 1867 to 1885 were trained in [[Germany]] and [[France]], and from 1885 to 1905 at [[Royal Indian Engineering College|Cooper's Hill]], [[London]], which was a noted professional college of forestry. From 1905 to 1926, the [[University of Oxford]], [[University of Cambridge]], and [[University of Edinburgh]] undertook the task of training Imperial Forestry Service officers.\n \nFrom 1927 to 1932, forest officers were trained at the Imperial [[Forest Research Institute (India)|Forest Research Institute]] (FRI) at [[Dehradun]] (established in 1906). Later The [[Forest Research Institute (India)|Indian Forest College]] (IFC) was established in 1938 at [[Dehradun]], and officers recruited to the Superior Forest Service by the states and provinces were trained there. [[Forestry]], which was managed by the federal government until then, was transferred to the \"provincial list\" by the Government of India Act 1935, and recruitment to the Imperial Forestry Service was subsequently discontinued.\n \nThe modern Indian Forest Service (IFS) was established in 1966, after independence, under the ''All India Services Act 1951'', for protection, conservation, and regeneration of forest resources.\n \nIndia has an area of 635,400&nbsp;km designated as forests, about 19.32 percent of the country. Forest is included in the [[Concurrent List]].\n\nRanks of the Indian Forest Service are as follows: Assistant Conservator of Forests - Probationary Officer, [[Divisional Forest Officer]] (DFOs), \n[[Deputy Conservator of Forests]],\n[[Conservator of Forests]] (CFs),\nChief Conservator of Forests (CCFs),\nAdditional [[Principal Chief Conservator of Forests]] (Addl.PCCFs),\n[[Principal Chief Conservator of Forests]] (PCCF) & Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (HoFF) - highest post in a State,\n[[Director General of Forests (India)]] - highest post at Centre, selected from amongst the senior-most PCCFs of states.\n\nThe training at [[Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy]] is designed in such a way that an IFS officer after completion of the probation, should be hardened enough to serve in the most difficult terrains of India. Another remarkable feature of this service is that it needs keen technical knowledge along with excellent administrative capacity to deliver the duty. Government of India is also providing Hari Singh fellowships to IFS officers to get specialized in the field of Remote Sensing and Geographical Information System from the [[ISRO]]'s [[Indian Institute of Remote Sensing]], [[University of Twente]]/[[ITC Enschede|ITC]] [[Netherlands]] and in Wildlife Management from the [[Wildlife Institute of India]]. The IFS officers also work in various International and National organizations related to management of forests, wildlife and environment such as [[Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations]], [[International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development]], SAARC Forestry Centre, [[Forest Survey of India]], [[Wildlife Institute of India]], [[Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education]] (ICFRE), [[Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy]] (IGNFA), Directorate of Forest Education, [[Wildlife Crime Control Bureau]] (WCCB), etc. besides getting entrusted with senior positions in the Central Secretariat, State Secretariats and various assignments under the Central Staffing Scheme.\n\n===Indian Police Service (IPS)===\n{{main|Indian Police Service}}\n\nThe Indian Police Service more popularly known as the 'IPS', is responsible for internal security, public safety and law and order. In 1948, a year after [[India]] gained [[Partition of India|independence]] from [[British Raj|Britain]], the Imperial Police (IP) was replaced by the Indian Police Service. The IPS is not a law enforcement agency in its own right; rather it is the body to which all senior police officers belong regardless of the agency for whom they work.\n\nAn IPS officer is subjected to and faces several life-threatening and harsh conditions which no other service in the country faces, they are entrusted with the overall law and order of the entire State as the Director General of Police and entire Districts as its Superintendent of Police, and in Metropolitan Cities as Deputy Commissioner or the entire City as the Commissioner of Police. As Commissioner of Police they enjoy magisterial powers.\n\nThe IPS officer takes charge as an [[Assistant Superintendent of Police]] of a Sub-division/circle after probation of 2 years. The tenure of this post is normally 3 years. The next appointment is as [[Superintendent of Police]] or [[Deputy commissioner of police (India)|Deputy Commissioner of Police]] after 4 years, they get promoted to Junior Administrative Grade after 9 years, then they serve as [[Superintendent of Police (India)|Senior Superintendent of Police]] and get pay of Selection Grade (Level 13) in 12-14 years, then as [[Deputy Inspector General of Police]] or [[Additional Commissioner of Police]] in 15 years, an [[Inspector General of Police]] in 18 years, [[Additional Director General of Police]] in 25 years and finally, the [[Director General of Police]] after 30 years in service.\n\nIPS officers also work in national government agencies such as [[Intelligence Bureau (India)|Intelligence Bureau]], [[Research and Analysis Wing]], [[Central Bureau of Investigation]], etc. IPS officers also get highly placed in several PSUs such as GAIL, SAIL, Indian Oil Corporation Limited etc. at the State Secretariat the Central Secretariat under the Central Staffing Scheme and in CAPFs such as Director General of Border Security Force, the [[Central Reserve Police Force]] and the [[Central Industrial Security Force]], etc. An IPS officer has vast opportunities to work in several International Organisations such as Interpol, International Cricket Council, the United Nations, Consulates (Foreign Missions) and Embassies all over the World in various capacities such as First Secretary, [[Consul (representative)|Consul]], [[Consul General]], Deputy High Commissioner, Minister, [[High Commissioner]] and [[Ambassador]].\n\nThe [[Director General of Police]] and [[Commissioner of Police]] is the head of the entire police force of the State or Metropolitan City (e.g. [[Kolkata]], [[Delhi]], [[Mumbai]], [[Chennai]]  etc.) and below him is the Additional DGP/Special Police Commissioner. The [[Inspector General#India|Inspector General]] or [[Joint Commissioner of Police]] is at the head of certain specialised police force like [[Criminal Investigation Department]], Special Branch, etc.\n\n==Reforms and changes==\nIn January 2012, the Government amended All India Services Rule 16 (3) which permits the Central Government in consultation with the State Government to retire in the public interest, incompetent and non-performing Officers after a review on their completion of 15 years or 25 years of qualifying service or attaining the age of 50.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Retire-non-performing-bureaucrats-Centre-to-states/Article1-881583.aspx| title= Retire non-performing bureaucrats: Centre to states| date= 1 July 2012| url-status= dead| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120701135717/http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Retire-non-performing-bureaucrats-Centre-to-states/Article1-881583.aspx| archivedate= 1 July 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"AIS lazy retire\">{{cite web |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/lazy-and-incompetent-babus-to-retire-early/1/162137.html |title=Lazy and incompetent babus to retire early|author=|date=30 November 2011 |work= |publisher=[[India Today]] |location=[[New Delhi]] |accessdate=8 March 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"corruption compulsory retirement\">{{cite web |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/graft-taint-may-lead-to-retirement-for-babus/1/179684.html |title=Corruption taint may lead to compulsory retirement for babus|author=|date=21 April 2012 |work= |publisher=[[India Today]] |location=[[New Delhi]] |accessdate=21 April 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"AIS retire 15 incompetence\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/report/proposal-to-retire-incompetent-officers-after-15-year-service/20111130.htm |title=Proposal to retire incompetent officers after 15-year service|author=|date=30 November 2011 |work= |publisher=Rediff News |location=[[New Delhi]] |accessdate=3 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn recommendation by [[Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions]], from year 2014 state civil servants are required to clear 1000 marks four-stage process including a written exam and interview conducted by Union Public Service Commission to get promoted to the three all India services which was previously based solely on basis of seniority and annual confidential reports.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/exams-for-state-civil-services-officers-for-promotion-to-ias-462676| title=Exams for state civil services officers for promotion to IAS| date=4 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url= http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Exams-for-state-civil-services-officers-for-promotion-to-IAS/articleshow/27861653.cms| title=State civil services officers for promotion to IAS| date=4 April 2014}}</ref>\nExpected Reforms:\n1) Creation of Indian Medical Service for Doctors\n2) All India Judicial Service- to attract best law talent into the higher judiciary\n3) Indian Education Service- to increase the quality of policy making at Central level\n\n==Disputes in using acronym IFS==\nIndian Forest Service (IFS) is the oldest service and as per the old British records acronym was used to specify the Imperial Forest Service officers. But when the Indian Foreign Service was created (1946) the acronym IFS was also used to address officers belonging to Foreign Service. Strong protests and arguments were raised by the officers of the Indian Forest Service Officers for the wrong and unhealthy practice of addressing the Indian Forest Officers as IFoS  by the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) and Union Public Service Commission (UPSC). As per their version if they want to change the acronym change the Indian Foreign Service as IFoS or Indian Diplomatic Service to avoid confusion.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Civil Services of India]]\n*[[Special Duty Allowance (SDA)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20091220111744/http://www.upsc.gov.in/ais/index.htm All India Services official website]\n* [http://upsc.gov.in/ Union Public Service Commission official website]\n* [http://persmin.nic.in/ Indian Administrative Service official website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090619060945/http://mha.nic.in/uniquepage.asp?Id_Pk=346 Indian Police Service official website]\n* [http://ifs.nic.in/ Indian Forest Service official website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110927174347/http://persmin.nic.in/ersheet/StartQryERS.asp List of IAS Officers]\n* [https://www.vaidikmart.com/product/desi-cow-bilona-ghee-1-ltr/ All India Desi Ghee Services official website]\n[[Category:All India Services| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|Public services in India}}{{Use Indian English|date=January 2019}}{{Refimprove|date=July 2009}}\nThe '''All India Services''' ('''AIS''') comprises [[Civil Services of India]], namely the [[Indian Administrative Service]] (IAS), the [[Indian Forest Service]] (IFS) <!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS TO INDIAN FOREIGN SERVICE --> and the [[Indian Police Service]] (IPS).<ref name=\"All India Services\">{{cite web|title=All India Services|url=http://www.archive.india.gov.in/knowindia/profile.php?id=32|website=Know India Official website of Government}}</ref> A common unique feature of the All India Services is that the members of these services are recruited by the Centre (Union government in federal polity), but their services are placed under various State cadres, and they have the liability to serve both under the State and under the Centre.<ref name=\"All India Services\"/> Due to the federal polity of the country, this is considered one of the tools that makes union government stronger than state governments.

This being the main responsibility, every civil servant is assigned to a particular office which deals with policy matters pertaining to that area. The policy matters are framed, modified, interpreted in this office under the direct supervision of the Administrative Officer in consultation with the Minister. The implementation of policies is also done on the advice of the Officer. The [[Cabinet Secretary]] stands at the top of the government machinery involved in policy making followed by Secretary/Additional Secretary, Joint Secretary, Director, Under Secretary and Junior Scale Officers in that order. These appointments are filled by civil servants according to seniority in the Civil Services. In the process of decision making, a number of officers give their views to the Minister who weighs the matter and makes a decision considering the issue involved.\n\nThe implementation process involves supervision and touring. The allocation of enormous funds to and by the field officers calls for supervision and the officials concerned have to reply to queries made in the Parliament for which they must remain well informed.\n\nThe Civil servant has also to represent the Government in another country or in International forums. At the level of Deputy Secretary, he is even authorized to sign agreements on behalf of the Government.\n\nA civil servant begins his career in the state with two years in probation. This period is spent at training schools, Secretariat, field offices or in a [[District Magistrate]]'s office. He is given the position of Sub-Divisional Magistrate and has to look after the law, order and general administration including developmental work in the area under his charge. After the probation and 2 years of services as a junior scale officer, the officer is put in the senior scale. Then he may function as District Magistrate, Managing Director of a Public Enterprise or Director of a Department. Senior Scale comprises the Senior Time Scale (Joint Secretary), Junior Administrative Grade (Additional Secretary) and the Selection Grade (Special Secretary). Selection Grade is given on promotion after 13 years of regular service. The next promotion within the State is that of a Commissioner-cum-Secretary after 16 years. This promotion also entitles them to the Super Time Scale. Then after 24 years of regular service an IAS officer may be promoted to Above super time scale who is designated as [[Principal Secretary (India)|Principal Secretaries]]/Financial Commissioners in some states\n\nEach State has many Secretaries/Principal Secretaries and only one [[Chief Secretary (India)|Chief Secretary]]. Some appointments of Secretaries are considered more prestigious than others, e.g., the Finance Secretary, Development Commissioners, Home Secretary and hence they enjoy the salary of a Principal Secretary. the Chief Secretary in the State is the top ranking civil servant and may be assisted by Additional Chief Secretaries. In some cadres/States e.g. New Delhi, Financial Commissioner and other high ranking secretaries such as Additional Chief Secretaries enjoy the pay of the Chief Secretary .\n\nIn the District, the administrative head is the [[District collector|Collector]] or Deputy Commissioner or District Magistrate. The DM/Collector/DC handle the affairs of the District including development functions. He necessarily tours all rural sectors inspecting specific projects, disputed sites and looks into the problems of people on the spot also.\n\nAt the divisional level, the Divisional Commissioner is in charge of his division. His role is to oversee law and order and general administration and developmental work. Appeals against the Divisional Commissioner are heard by the Chairman of the Board of Revenue.\n\n===Indian Forest Service (IFS)===\n{{main|Indian Forest Service}}\n\nIndia was one of the first countries in the world to introduce scientific forest management. In 1864, the British Raj established the [[Indian Forest Service#Imperial Forest Service (IFS)|Imperial Forest Department]]. In 1866 Dr. [[Dietrich Brandis]], a German forest officer, was appointed Inspector General of Forests. The Imperial Forestry Service was organized in 1867. \n \nOfficers appointed from 1867 to 1885 were trained in [[Germany]] and [[France]], and from 1885 to 1905 at [[Royal Indian Engineering College|Cooper's Hill]], [[London]], which was a noted professional college of forestry. From 1905 to 1926, the [[University of Oxford]], [[University of Cambridge]], and [[University of Edinburgh]] undertook the task of training Imperial Forestry Service officers.\n \nFrom 1927 to 1932, forest officers were trained at the Imperial [[Forest Research Institute (India)|Forest Research Institute]] (FRI) at [[Dehradun]] (established in 1906). Later The [[Forest Research Institute (India)|Indian Forest College]] (IFC) was established in 1938 at [[Dehradun]], and officers recruited to the Superior Forest Service by the states and provinces were trained there. [[Forestry]], which was managed by the federal government until then, was transferred to the \"provincial list\" by the Government of India Act 1935, and recruitment to the Imperial Forestry Service was subsequently discontinued.\n \nThe modern Indian Forest Service (IFS) was established in 1966, after independence, under the ''All India Services Act 1951'', for protection, conservation, and regeneration of forest resources.\n \nIndia has an area of 635,400&nbsp;km designated as forests, about 19.32 percent of the country. Forest is included in the [[Concurrent List]].\n\nRanks of the Indian Forest Service are as follows: Assistant Conservator of Forests - Probationary Officer, [[Divisional Forest Officer]] (DFOs), \n[[Deputy Conservator of Forests]],\n[[Conservator of Forests]] (CFs),\nChief Conservator of Forests (CCFs),\nAdditional [[Principal Chief Conservator of Forests]] (Addl.PCCFs),\n[[Principal Chief Conservator of Forests]] (PCCF) & Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (HoFF) - highest post in a State,\n[[Director General of Forests (India)]] - highest post at Centre, selected from amongst the senior-most PCCFs of states.\n\nThe training at [[Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy]] is designed in such a way that an IFS officer after completion of the probation, should be hardened enough to serve in the most difficult terrains of India. Another remarkable feature of this service is that it needs keen technical knowledge along with excellent administrative capacity to deliver the duty. Government of India is also providing Hari Singh fellowships to IFS officers to get specialized in the field of Remote Sensing and Geographical Information System from the [[ISRO]]'s [[Indian Institute of Remote Sensing]], [[University of Twente]]/[[ITC Enschede|ITC]] [[Netherlands]] and in Wildlife Management from the [[Wildlife Institute of India]]. The IFS officers also work in various International and National organizations related to management of forests, wildlife and environment such as [[Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations]], [[International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development]], SAARC Forestry Centre, [[Forest Survey of India]], [[Wildlife Institute of India]], [[Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education]] (ICFRE), [[Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy]] (IGNFA), Directorate of Forest Education, [[Wildlife Crime Control Bureau]] (WCCB), etc. besides getting entrusted with senior positions in the Central Secretariat, State Secretariats and various assignments under the Central Staffing Scheme.\n\n===Indian Police Service (IPS)===\n{{main|Indian Police Service}}\n\nThe Indian Police Service more popularly known as the 'IPS', is responsible for internal security, public safety and law and order. In 1948, a year after [[India]] gained [[Partition of India|independence]] from [[British Raj|Britain]], the Imperial Police (IP) was replaced by the Indian Police Service. The IPS is not a law enforcement agency in its own right; rather it is the body to which all senior police officers belong regardless of the agency for whom they work.\n\nAn IPS officer is subjected to and faces several life-threatening and harsh conditions which no other service in the country faces, they are entrusted with the overall law and order of the entire State as the Director General of Police and entire Districts as its Superintendent of Police, and in Metropolitan Cities as Deputy Commissioner or the entire City as the Commissioner of Police. As Commissioner of Police they enjoy magisterial powers.\n\nThe IPS officer takes charge as an [[Assistant Superintendent of Police]] of a Sub-division/circle after probation of 2 years. The tenure of this post is normally 3 years. The next appointment is as [[Superintendent of Police]] or [[Deputy commissioner of police (India)|Deputy Commissioner of Police]] after 4 years, they get promoted to Junior Administrative Grade after 9 years, then they serve as [[Superintendent of Police (India)|Senior Superintendent of Police]] and get pay of Selection Grade (Level 13) in 12-14 years, then as [[Deputy Inspector General of Police]] or [[Additional Commissioner of Police]] in 15 years, an [[Inspector General of Police]] in 18 years, [[Additional Director General of Police]] in 25 years and finally, the [[Director General of Police]] after 30 years in service.\n\nIPS officers also work in national government agencies such as [[Intelligence Bureau (India)|Intelligence Bureau]], [[Research and Analysis Wing]], [[Central Bureau of Investigation]], etc. IPS officers also get highly placed in several PSUs such as GAIL, SAIL, Indian Oil Corporation Limited etc. at the State Secretariat the Central Secretariat under the Central Staffing Scheme and in CAPFs such as Director General of Border Security Force, the [[Central Reserve Police Force]] and the [[Central Industrial Security Force]], etc. An IPS officer has vast opportunities to work in several International Organisations such as Interpol, International Cricket Council, the United Nations, Consulates (Foreign Missions) and Embassies all over the World in various capacities such as First Secretary, [[Consul (representative)|Consul]], [[Consul General]], Deputy High Commissioner, Minister, [[High Commissioner]] and [[Ambassador]].\n\nThe [[Director General of Police]] and [[Commissioner of Police]] is the head of the entire police force of the State or Metropolitan City (e.g. [[Kolkata]], [[Delhi]], [[Mumbai]], [[Chennai]]  etc.) and below him is the Additional DGP/Special Police Commissioner. The [[Inspector General#India|Inspector General]] or [[Joint Commissioner of Police]] is at the head of certain specialised police force like [[Criminal Investigation Department]], Special Branch, etc.\n\n==Reforms and changes==\nIn January 2012, the Government amended All India Services Rule 16 (3) which permits the Central Government in consultation with the State Government to retire in the public interest, incompetent and non-performing Officers after a review on their completion of 15 years or 25 years of qualifying service or attaining the age of 50.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Retire-non-performing-bureaucrats-Centre-to-states/Article1-881583.aspx| title= Retire non-performing bureaucrats: Centre to states| date= 1 July 2012| url-status= dead| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120701135717/http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Retire-non-performing-bureaucrats-Centre-to-states/Article1-881583.aspx| archivedate= 1 July 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"AIS lazy retire\">{{cite web |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/lazy-and-incompetent-babus-to-retire-early/1/162137.html |title=Lazy and incompetent babus to retire early|author=|date=30 November 2011 |work= |publisher=[[India Today]] |location=[[New Delhi]] |accessdate=8 March 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"corruption compulsory retirement\">{{cite web |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/graft-taint-may-lead-to-retirement-for-babus/1/179684.html |title=Corruption taint may lead to compulsory retirement for babus|author=|date=21 April 2012 |work= |publisher=[[India Today]] |location=[[New Delhi]] |accessdate=21 April 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"AIS retire 15 incompetence\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/report/proposal-to-retire-incompetent-officers-after-15-year-service/20111130.htm |title=Proposal to retire incompetent officers after 15-year service|author=|date=30 November 2011 |work= |publisher=Rediff News |location=[[New Delhi]] |accessdate=3 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn recommendation by [[Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions]], from year 2014 state civil servants are required to clear 1000 marks four-stage process including a written exam and interview conducted by Union Public Service Commission to get promoted to the three all India services which was previously based solely on basis of seniority and annual confidential reports.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/exams-for-state-civil-services-officers-for-promotion-to-ias-462676| title=Exams for state civil services officers for promotion to IAS| date=4 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url= http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Exams-for-state-civil-services-officers-for-promotion-to-IAS/articleshow/27861653.cms| title=State civil services officers for promotion to IAS| date=4 April 2014}}</ref>\nExpected Reforms:\n1) Creation of Indian Medical Service for Doctors\n2) All India Judicial Service- to attract best law talent into the higher judiciary\n3) Indian Education Service- to increase the quality of policy making at Central level\n\n==Disputes in using acronym IFS==\nIndian Forest Service (IFS) is the oldest service and as per the old British records acronym was used to specify the Imperial Forest Service officers. But when the Indian Foreign Service was created (1946) the acronym IFS was also used to address officers belonging to Foreign Service. Strong protests and arguments were raised by the officers of the Indian Forest Service Officers for the wrong and unhealthy practice of addressing the Indian Forest Officers as IFoS  by the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) and Union Public Service Commission (UPSC). As per their version if they want to change the acronym change the Indian Foreign Service as IFoS or Indian Diplomatic Service to avoid confusion.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Civil Services of India]]\n*[[Special Duty Allowance (SDA)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20091220111744/http://www.upsc.gov.in/ais/index.htm All India Services official website]\n* [http://upsc.gov.in/ Union Public Service Commission official website]\n* [http://persmin.nic.in/ Indian Administrative Service official website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090619060945/http://mha.nic.in/uniquepage.asp?Id_Pk=346 Indian Police Service official website]\n* [http://ifs.nic.in/ Indian Forest Service official website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110927174347/http://persmin.nic.in/ersheet/StartQryERS.asp List of IAS Officers]\n[[Category:All India Services| ]]\n", "name_user": "Vaidik Mart", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Services"}

This one is used to cancel out misalignment and vibrations.]]\nA '''coupling''' is a device used to connect two shafts together at their ends for the purpose of transmitting power. The primary purpose of couplings is to join two pieces of rotating equipment while permitting some degree of misalignment or end movement or both. In a more general context, a coupling can also be a mechanical device that serves to connect the ends of adjacent parts or objects.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/coupling|title=Definition of COUPLING|website=Merriam-webster.com|accessdate=28 November 2018}}</ref> Couplings do not normally allow disconnection of shafts during operation, however there are [[torque limiter|torque limiting]] couplings which can slip or disconnect when some torque limit is exceeded. Selection, installation and maintenance of couplings can lead to reduced maintenance time and maintenance cost.\n\n==Uses==\nmy dad has all of them and he says we should all just use grass hoppers instead \n\n\nOther common uses:\n\n* To alter the vibration characteristics of rotating units\n*To connect driving and the driven part\n*To introduce protection\n* To reduce the transmission of shock loads from one shaft to another\n*To slip when overload occurs\n\n==Types==\n\n'''Clamped''' or '''compression rigid''' couplings come in two parts and fit together around the shafts to form a sleeve. They offer more flexibility than sleeved models, and can be used on shafts that are fixed in place. They generally are large enough so that screws can pass all the way through the coupling and into the second half to ensure a secure hold. '''Flanged rigid couplings''' are designed for heavy loads or industrial equipment. They consist of short sleeves surrounded by a perpendicular flange. One coupling is placed on each shaft so the two flanges line up face to face. A series of screws or bolts can then be installed in the flanges to hold them together. Because of their size and durability, flanged units can be used to bring shafts into alignment before they are joined together.\n\n=== Examples of rigid couplings ===\nRigid couplings are used when precise shaft alignment is required; shaft misalignment will affect the coupling's performance as well as its life. \n\n<br />\n\n==== Beam coupling ====\n[[File:Beam Coupling - Helical Standard.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A beam coupling]]\nA ''beam'' coupling, also known as ''helical'' coupling, is a flexible coupling for transmitting torque between two shafts while allowing for angular misalignment, parallel offset and even axial motion, of one shaft relative to the other.  This design utilizes a single piece of material and becomes flexible by removal of material along a spiral path resulting in a curved flexible beam of helical shape.  Since it is made from a single piece of material, the Beam Style coupling does not exhibit the [[Backlash (engineering)|backlash]] found in some multi-piece couplings.  Another advantage of being an all machined coupling is the possibility to incorporate features into the final product while still keep the single piece integrity.\n\nChanges to the lead of the helical beam provide changes to misalignment capabilities as well as other performance characteristics such as torque capacity and torsional stiffness.  It is even possible to have multiple starts within the same helix.\n\nThe material used to manufacture the beam coupling also affects its performance and suitability for specific applications such as food, medical and aerospace.  Materials are typically aluminum alloy and stainless steel, but they can also be made in [[polyoxymethylene|acetal]], [[maraging steel]] and [[titanium]].  The most common applications are attaching [[rotary encoder]]s to shafts and motion control for [[robotics]].\n{{clear}}\n<gallery>\nFile:Special Beam Couplings with attachments.jpg|A beam coupling with optional features machined into it\nFile:Helical U-Joint (Beam Style Coupling) - Angular Misalignment.jpg|Increasing number of coils allows for greater angular misalignment\n</gallery><br />\n\n===== Bellows coupling =====\n[[Metal bellows]]\n\nlow backlash\n\n==== Bushed pin coupling ====\n\n====Bush pin type flange coupling====\nThis is used for slightly imperfect alignment of the two shafts.\n\nThis is modified form of the protected type flange coupling. This type of coupling has pins and it works with coupling bolts. The rubber or leather bushes are used over the pins. The coupling has two halves dissimilar in construction. The pins are rigidly fastened by nuts to one of the flange and kept loose on the other flange. This coupling is used to connect shafts which have a small parallel misalignment, angular misalignment or axial misalignment. In this coupling the rubber bushing absorbs shocks and vibration during its operations. This type of coupling is mostly used to couple electric motors and machines.\n\n====Constant velocity====\n{{Main article|Constant-velocity joint}}\nThere are various types of constant-velocity (CV) couplings: [[Constant-velocity joint#Rzeppa joints|Rzeppa joint]], [[Constant-velocity joint#Double Cardan|Double cardan]] joint, and [[Thompson coupling]].\n\n====Clamp or split-muff coupling====\nIn this coupling, the muff or sleeve is made into two halves parts of the cast iron and they are joined together by means of mild steel studs or bolts. The advantages of this coupling is that assembling or disassembling of the coupling is possible without changing the position of the shaft. This coupling is used for heavy power transmission at moderate speed.\n\n==== Diaphragm ====\nDiaphragm couplings transmit torque from the outside diameter of a flexible plate to the inside diameter, across the spool or spacer piece, and then from inside to outside diameter. The deforming of a plate or series of plates from I.D. to O.D accomplishes the misalignment.\n\n====Disc====\n{{Main article|Disc coupling}}\nDisc couplings transmit torque from a driving to a driven bolt tangentially on a common bolt circle. Torque is transmitted between the bolts through a series of thin, stainless steel discs assembled in a pack. Misalignment is accomplished by deforming of the material between the bolts.\n\n==== Donut coupling ====\n\n====Elastic====\n[[File:Windsurfing_equipment_2008_46.jpg|thumb|left|150px|An elastic coupling (for connecting a [[windsurfing]] sail rig to the board).]]\nAn elastic coupling transmits torque or other load by means of an elastic component. One example is the coupling used to join a [[windsurfing]] rig (sail, mast, and components) to the sailboard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unifiber.net/2015/blog/2015/03/review-windsurf-uj-types/|title=Review of Windsurf Universal Joint Types \u2013 'Your Ride, Our Gear'|website=Unifiber.net|accessdate=28 November 2018}}</ref> In windsurfing terminology it is usually called a \"universal joint\", but modern designs are usually based on a strong flexible material, and better technically described as an elastic coupling. They can be tendon or hourglass-shaped, and are constructed of a strong and durable elastic material. In this application, the coupling does not transmit torque, but instead transmits sail-power to the board, creating [[thrust]] (some portion of sail-power is also transmitted through the rider's body).\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Elastomeric coupling ====\n\n====Flexible====\nFlexible couplings are usually used to transmit [[torque]] from one shaft to another when the two shafts are slightly misaligned. They can accommodate varying degrees of misalignment up to 1.5\u00b0 and some parallel misalignment. They can also be used for vibration damping or noise reduction. In rotating shaft applications a flexible coupling can protect the driving and driven shaft components (such as bearings) from the harmful effects of conditions such as misaligned shafts, vibration, shock loads, and thermal expansion of the shafts or other components.\n\n====Fluid====\n{{Main article|Fluid coupling}}\n\n====Gear====\n[[Image:Gear coupling.png|thumb|left|150px|A gear coupling]]\n\nA ''gear coupling'' is a mechanical device for transmitting [[torque]] between two shafts that are not [[Line (geometry)|collinear]]. It consists of a flexible joint fixed to each shaft. The two joints are connected by a third shaft, called the spindle.\n\nEach joint consists of a 1:1 [[gear ratio]] internal/external [[gear]] pair. The tooth flanks and outer diameter of the external gear are crowned to allow for [[angular displacement]] between the two gears.  Mechanically, the gears are equivalent to [[rotating spline]]s with modified profiles. They are called gears because of the relatively large size of the teeth.\n\nGear couplings and [[universal joint]]s are used in similar applications. Gear couplings have higher [[torque density|torque densities]] than universal joints designed to fit a given space while universal joints induce lower [[vibration]]s. The limit on torque density in universal joints is due to the limited [[cross section (geometry)|cross sections]] of the cross and yoke. The gear teeth in a gear coupling have high [[backlash (gear)|backlash]] to allow for angular misalignment. The excess backlash can contribute to vibration.\n\nGear couplings are generally limited to angular misalignments, i.e., the angle of the spindle relative to the axes of the connected shafts, of 4\u20135\u00b0.  Universal joints are capable of higher misalignments.\n\nSingle joint gear couplings are also used to connect two nominally coaxial shafts. In this application the device is called a gear-type flexible, or [[flexible coupling]]. The single joint allows for minor misalignments such as installation errors and changes in shaft alignment due to operating conditions.  These types of gear couplings are generally limited to angular misalignments of 1/4\u20131/2\u00b0.\n\n<br />\n\n==== [[Geislinger coupling]] ====\n'''''[[Giubo]]''''' ( sometimes misspelled as '''guibo)''' , also known as a '''flex disc''', or Boschi joint \n\n====Grid====\nA ''grid coupling'' is composed of two shaft hubs, a metallic grid spring, and a split cover kit. Torque is transmitted between the two coupling shaft hubs through the metallic grid spring element.\n\nLike metallic gear and disc couplings, grid couplings have a high [[torque density]]. A benefit of grid couplings, over either gear or disc couplings, is the ability their grid coupling spring elements have to absorb and spread peak load impact energy over time. This reduces the magnitude of peak loads and offers some vibration dampening capability. A negative of the grid coupling design is that it generally is very limited in its ability to accommodate the misalignment.<ref>{{cite web|title = Why a Grid Coupling \u2013 Features & Benefits, Design Basics, and Element Options|url = http://www.couplinganswers.com/2014/12/why-grid-coupling-features-benefits.html |website=Couplinganswers.com |accessdate = 2014-12-22}}</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n====Hirth====\n{{Main article|Hirth joint}}\nHirth joints use tapered teeth on two shaft ends meshed together to transmit torque.\n\n<br />\n====[[fluid coupling|Hydrodynamic coupling]] (fluid coupling) ====\n\n==== [[Jaw coupling]] (or Spider or Lovejoy coupling) ====\n\n====Magnetic coupling====\n{{Main article|Magnetic coupling}}\nA [magnetic] coupling uses magnetic forces to transmit the power from one shaft to another without any contact. This allows for full medium separation.\nTherefore can provide the ability to hermetically separate two areas whilst continuing to transmit mechanical power from one to the other making these couplings ideal for applications where prevention of cross contamination is essential.\n\n==== [[Schmidt coupling]] ====\n\n==== Oldham ====\n[[Image:Oldham coupler animated small.gif|thumb|left|150px|Animated Oldham coupler]]\n\nAn ''Oldham coupling'' has three discs, one coupled to the input, one coupled to the output, and a middle disc that is joined to the first two by [[tongue and groove]].  The tongue and groove on one side is perpendicular to the tongue and groove on the other. The middle disc rotates around its center at the same speed as the input and output shafts.  Its center traces a circular orbit, twice per rotation, around the midpoint between input and output shafts. Often [[Spring (device)|spring]]s are used to reduce [[Backlash (engineering)|backlash]] of the mechanism. An advantage to this type of coupling, as compared to two universal joints, is its compact size. The coupler is named for [[John Oldham (engineer)|John Oldham]] who invented it in [[Ireland]], in 1821, to solve a problem in a [[paddle steamer]] design.\n\n{{clear}}\n<gallery>\nImage:Klauenkupplung 1.jpg|Oldham coupler, assembled\nImage:Klauenkupplung 3.jpg|Oldham coupler, disassembled\n</gallery>\n\n====Sleeve, box, or muff coupling====\n\nA [[sleeve coupling]] consists of a [[pipe (fluid conveyance)|pipe]] whose [[Bore (engine)|bore]] is finished to the required tolerance based on the shaft size. Based on the usage of the coupling a [[Keyway (engineering)|keyway]] is made in the bore in order to transmit the [[torque]] by means of the key. Two threaded holes are provided in order to lock the coupling in position.\n\nSleeve couplings are also known as '''box Couplings'''. In this case shaft ends are coupled together and abutted against each other which are enveloped by ''muff'' or ''sleeve''. \n\nA ''gib head sunk keys'' hold the two shafts and sleeve together (this is the simplest type of the coupling) It is made from the cast iron and very simple to design and manufacture. It consists of a hollow pipe whose inner diameter is same as diameter of the shafts.\nThe hollow pipe is fitted over a two or more ends of the shafts with the help of the taper sunk key. A key and sleeve are useful to transmit power from one shaft to another shaft.\n\n==== Tapered shaft lock ====\nA '''tapered lock''' is a form of [[Key (engineering)|key]]less shaft locking device<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lovejoy-inc.com/products/shaft-locking-devices.aspx|title=Lovejoy, Inc. : Products : Couplings & Power Transmission: Shaft Locking Devices|website=Lovejoy-inc.com|accessdate=7 January 2015}}</ref> that does not require any material to be removed from the shaft.

It consists of:\n* Performing visual inspections, \n*checking for signs of wear or fatigue\n*cleaning couplings regularly\n* Checking and changing lubricant regularly if the coupling is lubricated. This maintenance is required annually for most couplings and more frequently for couplings in adverse environments or in demanding operating conditions.\n* Documenting the maintenance performed on each coupling, along with the date.<ref name=PlantServices>{{cite web|author=Boyle, B.|date=2008|title=Tracking the causes of coupling failure|url=http://www.plantservices.com/articles/2008/197.html|quote=Explore coupling maintenance and the telltale signs of failure to maximize coupling life and ensure reliable system operations|website=Plantservices.com|accessdate=7 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nEven with proper maintenance, however, couplings can fail. Underlying reasons for failure, other than maintenance, include:\n* Improper installation\n* Poor coupling selection\n* Operation beyond design capabilities.<ref name=\"PlantServices\" />\n\nThe only way to improve coupling life is to understand what caused the failure and to correct it prior to installing a new coupling.\nSome external signs that indicate potential coupling failure include:\n* Abnormal noise, such as screeching, squealing or chattering\n* Excessive vibration or wobble\n* Failed seals indicated by lubricant leakage or contamination.<ref name=\"PlantServices\" />\n\n==Checking the coupling balance==\nCouplings are normally balanced at the factory prior to being shipped, but they occasionally go out of balance in operation. Balancing can be difficult and expensive, and is normally done only when operating tolerances are such that the effort and the expense are justified. The amount of coupling unbalance that can be tolerated by any system is dictated by the characteristics of the specific connected machines and can be determined by detailed analysis or experience.<ref name=\"PlantServices\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Oldham couplings}}\n*[http://kmoddl.library.cornell.edu/biographies/Oldham/index.php Biography of Oldham at Cornell University]\n*[[Yutaka Nishiyama]], [http://ijpam.eu/contents/2012-81-1/8/8.pdf From Oldham's Coupling to Air Conditioners]\n\n{{Powertrain}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Rotating shaft couplings| ]]\n[[Category:Mechanisms (engineering)]]\n[[Category:Hardware (mechanical)]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|a mechanical connection between two objects}}\n\n{{Refimprove|date=March 2012}}\n[[Image:Rotating coupling.gif|frame|Rotating coupling]]\n[[Image:TireClutch.JPG|thumb|An improvised flexible coupling made of car tire pieces connects the drive shafts of an engine and a water pump.

In a more general context, a coupling can also be a mechanical device that serves to connect the ends of adjacent parts or objects.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/coupling|title=Definition of COUPLING|website=Merriam-webster.com|accessdate=28 November 2018}}</ref> Couplings do not normally allow disconnection of shafts during operation, however there are [[torque limiter|torque limiting]] couplings which can slip or disconnect when some torque limit is exceeded. Selection, installation and maintenance of couplings can lead to reduced maintenance time and maintenance cost.\n\n==Uses==\nShaft couplings are used in machinery for several purposes. A primary function is to transfer power from one end to another end (ex: motor transfer power to pump through coupling).\n\nOther common uses:\n\n* To alter the vibration characteristics of rotating units\n*To connect driving and the driven part\n*To introduce protection\n* To reduce the transmission of shock loads from one shaft to another\n*To slip when overload occurs\n\n==Types==\n\n'''Clamped''' or '''compression rigid''' couplings come in two parts and fit together around the shafts to form a sleeve. They offer more flexibility than sleeved models, and can be used on shafts that are fixed in place. They generally are large enough so that screws can pass all the way through the coupling and into the second half to ensure a secure hold. '''Flanged rigid couplings''' are designed for heavy loads or industrial equipment. They consist of short sleeves surrounded by a perpendicular flange. One coupling is placed on each shaft so the two flanges line up face to face. A series of screws or bolts can then be installed in the flanges to hold them together. Because of their size and durability, flanged units can be used to bring shafts into alignment before they are joined together.\n\n=== Examples of rigid couplings ===\nRigid couplings are used when precise shaft alignment is required; shaft misalignment will affect the coupling's performance as well as its life. \n\n<br />\n\n==== Beam coupling ====\n[[File:Beam Coupling - Helical Standard.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A beam coupling]]\nA ''beam'' coupling, also known as ''helical'' coupling, is a flexible coupling for transmitting torque between two shafts while allowing for angular misalignment, parallel offset and even axial motion, of one shaft relative to the other.  This design utilizes a single piece of material and becomes flexible by removal of material along a spiral path resulting in a curved flexible beam of helical shape.  Since it is made from a single piece of material, the Beam Style coupling does not exhibit the [[Backlash (engineering)|backlash]] found in some multi-piece couplings.  Another advantage of being an all machined coupling is the possibility to incorporate features into the final product while still keep the single piece integrity.\n\nChanges to the lead of the helical beam provide changes to misalignment capabilities as well as other performance characteristics such as torque capacity and torsional stiffness.  It is even possible to have multiple starts within the same helix.\n\nThe material used to manufacture the beam coupling also affects its performance and suitability for specific applications such as food, medical and aerospace.  Materials are typically aluminum alloy and stainless steel, but they can also be made in [[polyoxymethylene|acetal]], [[maraging steel]] and [[titanium]].  The most common applications are attaching [[rotary encoder]]s to shafts and motion control for [[robotics]].\n{{clear}}\n<gallery>\nFile:Special Beam Couplings with attachments.jpg|A beam coupling with optional features machined into it\nFile:Helical U-Joint (Beam Style Coupling) - Angular Misalignment.jpg|Increasing number of coils allows for greater angular misalignment\n</gallery><br />\n\n===== Bellows coupling =====\n[[Metal bellows]]\n\nlow backlash\n\n==== Bushed pin coupling ====\n\n====Bush pin type flange coupling====\nThis is used for slightly imperfect alignment of the two shafts.\n\nThis is modified form of the protected type flange coupling. This type of coupling has pins and it works with coupling bolts. The rubber or leather bushes are used over the pins. The coupling has two halves dissimilar in construction. The pins are rigidly fastened by nuts to one of the flange and kept loose on the other flange. This coupling is used to connect shafts which have a small parallel misalignment, angular misalignment or axial misalignment. In this coupling the rubber bushing absorbs shocks and vibration during its operations. This type of coupling is mostly used to couple electric motors and machines.\n\n====Constant velocity====\n{{Main article|Constant-velocity joint}}\nThere are various types of constant-velocity (CV) couplings: [[Constant-velocity joint#Rzeppa joints|Rzeppa joint]], [[Constant-velocity joint#Double Cardan|Double cardan]] joint, and [[Thompson coupling]].\n\n====Clamp or split-muff coupling====\nIn this coupling, the muff or sleeve is made into two halves parts of the cast iron and they are joined together by means of mild steel studs or bolts. The advantages of this coupling is that assembling or disassembling of the coupling is possible without changing the position of the shaft. This coupling is used for heavy power transmission at moderate speed.\n\n==== Diaphragm ====\nDiaphragm couplings transmit torque from the outside diameter of a flexible plate to the inside diameter, across the spool or spacer piece, and then from inside to outside diameter. The deforming of a plate or series of plates from I.D. to O.D accomplishes the misalignment.\n\n====Disc====\n{{Main article|Disc coupling}}\nDisc couplings transmit torque from a driving to a driven bolt tangentially on a common bolt circle. Torque is transmitted between the bolts through a series of thin, stainless steel discs assembled in a pack. Misalignment is accomplished by deforming of the material between the bolts.\n\n==== Donut coupling ====\n\n====Elastic====\n[[File:Windsurfing_equipment_2008_46.jpg|thumb|left|150px|An elastic coupling (for connecting a [[windsurfing]] sail rig to the board).]]\nAn elastic coupling transmits torque or other load by means of an elastic component. One example is the coupling used to join a [[windsurfing]] rig (sail, mast, and components) to the sailboard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unifiber.net/2015/blog/2015/03/review-windsurf-uj-types/|title=Review of Windsurf Universal Joint Types \u2013 'Your Ride, Our Gear'|website=Unifiber.net|accessdate=28 November 2018}}</ref> In windsurfing terminology it is usually called a \"universal joint\", but modern designs are usually based on a strong flexible material, and better technically described as an elastic coupling. They can be tendon or hourglass-shaped, and are constructed of a strong and durable elastic material. In this application, the coupling does not transmit torque, but instead transmits sail-power to the board, creating [[thrust]] (some portion of sail-power is also transmitted through the rider's body).\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Elastomeric coupling ====\n\n====Flexible====\nFlexible couplings are usually used to transmit [[torque]] from one shaft to another when the two shafts are slightly misaligned. They can accommodate varying degrees of misalignment up to 1.5\u00b0 and some parallel misalignment. They can also be used for vibration damping or noise reduction. In rotating shaft applications a flexible coupling can protect the driving and driven shaft components (such as bearings) from the harmful effects of conditions such as misaligned shafts, vibration, shock loads, and thermal expansion of the shafts or other components.\n\n====Fluid====\n{{Main article|Fluid coupling}}\n\n====Gear====\n[[Image:Gear coupling.png|thumb|left|150px|A gear coupling]]\n\nA ''gear coupling'' is a mechanical device for transmitting [[torque]] between two shafts that are not [[Line (geometry)|collinear]]. It consists of a flexible joint fixed to each shaft. The two joints are connected by a third shaft, called the spindle.\n\nEach joint consists of a 1:1 [[gear ratio]] internal/external [[gear]] pair. The tooth flanks and outer diameter of the external gear are crowned to allow for [[angular displacement]] between the two gears.  Mechanically, the gears are equivalent to [[rotating spline]]s with modified profiles. They are called gears because of the relatively large size of the teeth.\n\nGear couplings and [[universal joint]]s are used in similar applications. Gear couplings have higher [[torque density|torque densities]] than universal joints designed to fit a given space while universal joints induce lower [[vibration]]s. The limit on torque density in universal joints is due to the limited [[cross section (geometry)|cross sections]] of the cross and yoke. The gear teeth in a gear coupling have high [[backlash (gear)|backlash]] to allow for angular misalignment. The excess backlash can contribute to vibration.\n\nGear couplings are generally limited to angular misalignments, i.e., the angle of the spindle relative to the axes of the connected shafts, of 4\u20135\u00b0.  Universal joints are capable of higher misalignments.\n\nSingle joint gear couplings are also used to connect two nominally coaxial shafts. In this application the device is called a gear-type flexible, or [[flexible coupling]]. The single joint allows for minor misalignments such as installation errors and changes in shaft alignment due to operating conditions.  These types of gear couplings are generally limited to angular misalignments of 1/4\u20131/2\u00b0.\n\n<br />\n\n==== [[Geislinger coupling]] ====\n'''''[[Giubo]]''''' ( sometimes misspelled as '''guibo)''' , also known as a '''flex disc''', or Boschi joint \n\n====Grid====\nA ''grid coupling'' is composed of two shaft hubs, a metallic grid spring, and a split cover kit. Torque is transmitted between the two coupling shaft hubs through the metallic grid spring element.\n\nLike metallic gear and disc couplings, grid couplings have a high [[torque density]]. A benefit of grid couplings, over either gear or disc couplings, is the ability their grid coupling spring elements have to absorb and spread peak load impact energy over time. This reduces the magnitude of peak loads and offers some vibration dampening capability. A negative of the grid coupling design is that it generally is very limited in its ability to accommodate the misalignment.<ref>{{cite web|title = Why a Grid Coupling \u2013 Features & Benefits, Design Basics, and Element Options|url = http://www.couplinganswers.com/2014/12/why-grid-coupling-features-benefits.html |website=Couplinganswers.com |accessdate = 2014-12-22}}</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n====Hirth====\n{{Main article|Hirth joint}}\nHirth joints use tapered teeth on two shaft ends meshed together to transmit torque.\n\n<br />\n====[[fluid coupling|Hydrodynamic coupling]] (fluid coupling) ====\n\n==== [[Jaw coupling]] (or Spider or Lovejoy coupling) ====\n\n====Magnetic coupling====\n{{Main article|Magnetic coupling}}\nA [magnetic] coupling uses magnetic forces to transmit the power from one shaft to another without any contact. This allows for full medium separation.\nTherefore can provide the ability to hermetically separate two areas whilst continuing to transmit mechanical power from one to the other making these couplings ideal for applications where prevention of cross contamination is essential.\n\n==== [[Schmidt coupling]] ====\n\n==== Oldham ====\n[[Image:Oldham coupler animated small.gif|thumb|left|150px|Animated Oldham coupler]]\n\nAn ''Oldham coupling'' has three discs, one coupled to the input, one coupled to the output, and a middle disc that is joined to the first two by [[tongue and groove]].  The tongue and groove on one side is perpendicular to the tongue and groove on the other. The middle disc rotates around its center at the same speed as the input and output shafts.  Its center traces a circular orbit, twice per rotation, around the midpoint between input and output shafts. Often [[Spring (device)|spring]]s are used to reduce [[Backlash (engineering)|backlash]] of the mechanism. An advantage to this type of coupling, as compared to two universal joints, is its compact size. The coupler is named for [[John Oldham (engineer)|John Oldham]] who invented it in [[Ireland]], in 1821, to solve a problem in a [[paddle steamer]] design.\n\n{{clear}}\n<gallery>\nImage:Klauenkupplung 1.jpg|Oldham coupler, assembled\nImage:Klauenkupplung 3.jpg|Oldham coupler, disassembled\n</gallery>\n\n====Sleeve, box, or muff coupling====\n\nA [[sleeve coupling]] consists of a [[pipe (fluid conveyance)|pipe]] whose [[Bore (engine)|bore]] is finished to the required tolerance based on the shaft size. Based on the usage of the coupling a [[Keyway (engineering)|keyway]] is made in the bore in order to transmit the [[torque]] by means of the key. Two threaded holes are provided in order to lock the coupling in position.\n\nSleeve couplings are also known as '''box Couplings'''. In this case shaft ends are coupled together and abutted against each other which are enveloped by ''muff'' or ''sleeve''. \n\nA ''gib head sunk keys'' hold the two shafts and sleeve together (this is the simplest type of the coupling) It is made from the cast iron and very simple to design and manufacture. It consists of a hollow pipe whose inner diameter is same as diameter of the shafts.\nThe hollow pipe is fitted over a two or more ends of the shafts with the help of the taper sunk key. A key and sleeve are useful to transmit power from one shaft to another shaft.\n\n==== Tapered shaft lock ====\nA '''tapered lock''' is a form of [[Key (engineering)|key]]less shaft locking device<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lovejoy-inc.com/products/shaft-locking-devices.aspx|title=Lovejoy, Inc. : Products : Couplings & Power Transmission: Shaft Locking Devices|website=Lovejoy-inc.com|accessdate=7 January 2015}}</ref> that does not require any material to be removed from the shaft. The basic idea is similar to a clamp coupling but the moment of rotation is closer to the center of the shaft.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ustsubaki.com/pdf/l0930000_power_lock_catalog.pdf|title=U.S. Tsubaki POWER-LOCK Catalog|website=Ustsubaki.com|format=PDF|accessdate=7 January 2015}}</ref> An alternative [[Coupling#Others|coupling device]] to the traditional [[Key (engineering)#Parallel keys|parallel key]], the tapered lock removes the possibility of [[Backlash (engineering)|play]] due to worn keyways.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tsubakimoto.com/mining-industry/power-lock|title=Power Lock|website=Tsubakimoto.com|accessdate=7 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904160139/http://www.fennerdrives.com/catalogs/keyless_bushings.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=4 September 2012|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=28 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://tsubakimoto.com/power-transmission/shaft-coupling/disc/echt-flex/nef-taper-lock|title=NEF Taper-Lock Series|website=Tsubakimoto.com|accessdate=7 January 2015}}</ref> It is more robust than using a key because maintenance only requires one tool and the self-centering balanced rotation means it lasts longer than a keyed joint would, but the downside is that it costs more.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n<br />\n\n==== Twin spring coupling ====\nA flexible coupling made from two counterwound springs with a ball bearing in the center, which allows torque transfer from input to output shaft.

It consists of:\n* Performing visual inspections, \n*checking for signs of wear or fatigue\n*cleaning couplings regularly\n* Checking and changing lubricant regularly if the coupling is lubricated. This maintenance is required annually for most couplings and more frequently for couplings in adverse environments or in demanding operating conditions.\n* Documenting the maintenance performed on each coupling, along with the date.<ref name=PlantServices>{{cite web|author=Boyle, B.|date=2008|title=Tracking the causes of coupling failure|url=http://www.plantservices.com/articles/2008/197.html|quote=Explore coupling maintenance and the telltale signs of failure to maximize coupling life and ensure reliable system operations|website=Plantservices.com|accessdate=7 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nEven with proper maintenance, however, couplings can fail. Underlying reasons for failure, other than maintenance, include:\n* Improper installation\n* Poor coupling selection\n* Operation beyond design capabilities.<ref name=\"PlantServices\" />\n\nThe only way to improve coupling life is to understand what caused the failure and to correct it prior to installing a new coupling.\nSome external signs that indicate potential coupling failure include:\n* Abnormal noise, such as screeching, squealing or chattering\n* Excessive vibration or wobble\n* Failed seals indicated by lubricant leakage or contamination.<ref name=\"PlantServices\" />\n\n==Checking the coupling balance==\nCouplings are normally balanced at the factory prior to being shipped, but they occasionally go out of balance in operation. Balancing can be difficult and expensive, and is normally done only when operating tolerances are such that the effort and the expense are justified. The amount of coupling unbalance that can be tolerated by any system is dictated by the characteristics of the specific connected machines and can be determined by detailed analysis or experience.<ref name=\"PlantServices\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Oldham couplings}}\n*[http://kmoddl.library.cornell.edu/biographies/Oldham/index.php Biography of Oldham at Cornell University]\n*[[Yutaka Nishiyama]], [http://ijpam.eu/contents/2012-81-1/8/8.pdf From Oldham's Coupling to Air Conditioners]\n\n{{Powertrain}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Rotating shaft couplings| ]]\n[[Category:Mechanisms (engineering)]]\n[[Category:Hardware (mechanical)]]\n", "name_user": "2.27.213.26", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(fat poopy bottom)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling"}

For each seed there is a corresponding region consisting of all points of the plane closer to that seed than to any other. These regions are called Voronoi cells. The Voronoi diagram of a set of points is [[Duality (mathematics)|dual]] to its [[Delaunay triangulation]].\n\nThe Voronoi diagram is named after Russian mathematician [[Georgy Voronoy]], and is also called a '''Voronoi tessellation''', a '''Voronoi decomposition''', a '''Voronoi partition''', or a '''Dirichlet tessellation''' (after [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]]).

In this case each site ''p''<sub>''k''</sub> is simply a point, and its corresponding Voronoi cell ''R''<sub>''k''</sub> consists of every point in the Euclidean plane whose distance to ''p''<sub>''k''</sub> is less than or equal to its distance to any other ''p''<sub>''k''</sub>. Each such cell is obtained from the intersection of [[Half-space (geometry)|half-spaces]], and hence it is a [[convex polygon]]. The [[line segment]]s of the Voronoi diagram are all the points in the plane that are equidistant to the two nearest sites.  The Voronoi vertices ([[Node (graph theory)|node]]s) are the points equidistant to three (or more) sites.\n\n==Formal definition==\nLet <math display=\"inline\"> X </math> be a [[metric space]] with distance function <math display=\"inline\">d</math>. Let <math display=\"inline\">K</math> be a set of indices and let <math display=\"inline\">(P_k)_{k \\in K}</math> be a [[tuple]] (ordered collection) of nonempty [[subsets]] (the sites) in the space <math display=\"inline\"> X</math>. The Voronoi cell, or Voronoi region,  <math display=\"inline\"> R_k</math>, associated with the site <math display=\"inline\">P_k</math> is the set of all points in <math display=\"inline\">X</math> whose distance to <math display=\"inline\"> P_k</math> is not greater than their distance to the other sites <math display=\"inline\">P_j</math>, where <math display=\"inline\">j</math> is any index different from <math display=\"inline\">k</math>. In other words, if <math display=\"inline\"> d(x,\\, A) = \\inf\\{d(x,\\, a) \\mid a \\in A\\}</math> denotes the distance between the point <math display=\"inline\">x</math> and the subset <math display=\"inline\">A</math>, then\n\n:<math> R_k = \\{x \\in X \\mid d(x, P_k) \\leq d(x, P_j)\\; \\text{for all}\\; j \\neq k\\}</math>\n\nThe Voronoi diagram is simply the [[tuple]] of cells <math display=\"inline\">(R_k)_{k \\in K} </math>. In principle, some of the sites can intersect and even coincide (an application is described below for sites representing shops), but usually they are assumed to be disjoint. In addition, infinitely many sites are allowed in the definition (this setting has  applications in [[geometry of numbers]] and [[crystallography]]), but again, in many cases only finitely many sites are considered.\n\nIn the particular case where the space is a [[finite-dimensional]] [[Euclidean space]], each site is a point, there are finitely many points and all of them are different, then the Voronoi cells are [[convex polytope]]s and they can be represented in a combinatorial way using their vertices, sides, two-dimensional faces, etc. Sometimes the induced combinatorial structure is referred to as the Voronoi diagram. However, the Voronoi cells may not be convex or even connected.\n\nIn the usual Euclidean space,  we can rewrite the formal definition in usual terms. Each Voronoi polygon <math display=\"inline\">R_k</math> is associated with a generator point  <math display=\"inline\">P_k</math>.\nLet <math display=\"inline\">X</math> be the set of all points in the Euclidean space. Let <math display=\"inline\">P_1</math> be a point that generates its Voronoi region  <math display=\"inline\">R_1</math>, <math display=\"inline\">P_2</math> that generates  <math display=\"inline\">R_2</math>, and <math display=\"inline\">P_3</math> that generates  <math display=\"inline\">R_3</math>, and so on. <!--Then,\n\n:<math> R_1 = \\{x \\in X \\mid d(x, P_1) \\leq d(x, P_2) \\;\\and\\; d(x, P_1) \\leq d(x, P_3) \\;\\and\\; \\ldots\\}</math>\n:<math> R_2 = \\{x \\in X \\mid d(x, P_2) \\leq d(x, P_1) \\;\\and\\; d(x, P_2) \\leq d(x, P_3) \\;\\and\\; \\ldots\\}</math>\n:...\n--> Then, as expressed by Tran ''et al''<ref name=\"Tran09\">{{cite book |first1=Q.

Suppose we want to estimate the number of customers of a given shop. With all else being equal (price, products, quality of service, etc.), it is reasonable to assume that customers choose their preferred shop simply by distance considerations: they will go to the shop located nearest to them. In this case the Voronoi cell <math>\\scriptstyle R_k</math> of a given shop <math>\\scriptstyle P_k</math> can be used for giving a rough estimate on the number of potential customers going to this shop (which is modeled by a point in our city).\n\nFor most cities, the distance between points can be measured using the familiar\n[[Euclidean distance]]: <math>\\ell_2 = d\\left[\\left(a_1, a_2\\right), \\left(b_1, b_2\\right)\\right] = \\sqrt{\\left(a_1 - b_1\\right)^2 + \\left(a_2 - b_2\\right)^2}</math> or the [[Manhattan distance]]:<math>d\\left[\\left(a_1, a_2\\right), \\left(b_1, b_2\\right)\\right] = \\left|a_1 - b_1\\right| + \\left|a_2 - b_2\\right|</math>. The corresponding Voronoi diagrams look different for different distance metrics.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = center\n | direction = horizontal\n | width     = 382\n | header    = Voronoi diagrams of 20 points under two different metrics\n | header_align = center\n | image1    = Euclidean Voronoi diagram.svg\n | alt1      = Voronoi diagram under Euclidean distance\n | caption1  = [[Euclidean distance]]\n | image2    = Manhattan Voronoi Diagram.svg\n | alt2      = Voronoi diagram under Manhattan distance\n | caption2  = [[Manhattan distance]]\n}}\n\n==Properties==\n* The [[dual graph]] for a Voronoi diagram (in the case of a [[Euclidean space]] with point sites) corresponds to the [[Delaunay triangulation]] for the same set of points.\n* The [[closest pair of points]] corresponds to two adjacent cells in the Voronoi diagram.\n* Assume the setting is the [[Euclidean plane]] and a group of different points is given. Then two points are adjacent on the [[convex hull]] if and only if their Voronoi cells share an infinitely long side.\n* If the space is a [[normed space]] and the distance to each site is attained (e.g., when a site is a [[compact set]] or a closed ball), then each Voronoi cell can be represented as a union of line segments emanating from the sites.<ref name=Reem_alg>{{harvnb|Reem|2009}}</ref> As shown there, this property does not necessarily hold when the distance is not attained.\n* Under relatively general conditions (the space is a possibly infinite-dimensional [[uniformly convex space]], there can be infinitely many sites of a general form, etc.) Voronoi cells enjoy a certain stability property: a small change in the shapes of the sites, e.g., a change caused by some translation or distortion, yields a small change in the shape of the Voronoi cells. This is the geometric stability of Voronoi diagrams.<ref name=Reem_geo_stable>{{harvnb|Reem|2011}}</ref> As shown there, this property does not hold in general, even if the space is two-dimensional (but non-uniformly convex, and, in particular, non-Euclidean) and the sites are points.\n\n==History and research==\nInformal use of Voronoi diagrams can be traced back to [[Descartes]] in 1644. [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]] used two-dimensional and three-dimensional Voronoi diagrams in his study of quadratic forms in 1850.\nBritish physician [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] used a Voronoi diagram in 1854 to illustrate how the majority of people who died in the [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak|Broad Street cholera outbreak]] lived closer to the infected [[Soho#Broad Street pump|Broad Street pump]] than to any other water pump.\n\nVoronoi diagrams are named after Russian mathematician [[Georgy Voronoy|Georgy Feodosievych Voronoy]] who defined and studied the general ''n''-dimensional case in 1908. Voronoi diagrams that are used in [[geophysics]] and [[meteorology]] to analyse spatially distributed data (such as rainfall measurements) are called Thiessen polygons after American meteorologist [[Alfred H. Thiessen]]. In [[condensed matter physics]], such tessellations are also known as [[Wigner\u2013Seitz unit cell]]s. Voronoi tessellations of the [[reciprocal lattice]] of [[momentum|momenta]] are called [[Brillouin zone]]s. For general lattices in [[Lie group]]s,  the cells are simply called [[fundamental domain]]s. In the case of general [[metric space]]s, the cells are often called metric [[fundamental polygon]]s.\nOther equivalent names for this concept (or particular important cases of it): Voronoi polyhedra, Voronoi polygons, domain(s) of influence, Voronoi decomposition, Voronoi tessellation(s), Dirichlet tessellation(s).\n\n==Examples==\n[[Image:Coloured Voronoi 3D slice.svg|right|thumb|This is a slice of the Voronoi diagram of a random set of points in a 3D box. In general, a cross section of a 3D Voronoi tessellation is not a 2D Voronoi tessellation itself. (The cells are all [[Convex set|convex]] [[polyhedron|polyhedra]].)]]\n\nVoronoi tessellations of regular [[Lattice (group)|lattice]]s of points in two or three dimensions give rise to many familiar tessellations.\n* A 2D lattice gives an irregular honeycomb tessellation, with equal hexagons with point symmetry; in the case of a regular triangular lattice it is regular; in the case of a rectangular lattice the hexagons reduce to rectangles in rows and columns; a [[Square (geometry)|square]] lattice gives the regular tessellation of squares; note that the rectangles and the squares can also be generated by other lattices (for example the lattice defined by the vectors (1,0) and (1/2,1/2) gives squares). See [https://mbostock.github.com/d3/ex/voronoi.html here] for a dynamic visual example.\n* A [[simple cubic lattice]] gives the [[cubic honeycomb]].\n* A [[hexagonal close-packed]] lattice gives a tessellation of space with [[trapezo-rhombic dodecahedron|trapezo-rhombic dodecahedra]].\n* A [[face-centred cubic]] lattice gives a tessellation of space with [[rhombic dodecahedron|rhombic dodecahedra]].\n* A [[body-centred cubic]] lattice gives a tessellation of space with [[truncated octahedron|truncated octahedra]].\n* Parallel planes with regular triangular lattices aligned with each other's centers give the [[hexagonal prismatic honeycomb]].\n* Certain body-centered tetragonal lattices give a tessellation of space with [[rhombo-hexagonal dodecahedron|rhombo-hexagonal dodecahedra]].\n\nFor the set of points (''x'',&nbsp;''y'') with ''x'' in a discrete set ''X'' and ''y'' in a discrete set ''Y'', we get rectangular tiles with the points not necessarily at their centers.\n\n==Higher-order Voronoi diagrams==\nAlthough a normal Voronoi cell is defined as the set of points closest to a single point in ''S'', an ''n''th-order Voronoi cell is defined as the set of points having a particular set of ''n'' points in ''S'' as its ''n'' nearest neighbors. Higher-order Voronoi diagrams also subdivide space.\n\nHigher-order Voronoi diagrams can be generated recursively.  To generate the ''n''<sup>th</sup>-order Voronoi diagram from set&nbsp;''S'', start with the (''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)<sup>th</sup>-order diagram and replace each cell generated by ''X''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{''x''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''x''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''x''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>} with a Voronoi diagram generated on the set&nbsp;''S''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''X''.\n\n===Farthest-point Voronoi diagram===\nFor a set of ''n'' points the (''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)<sup>th</sup>-order Voronoi diagram is called a farthest-point Voronoi diagram.\n\nFor a given set of points ''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{''p''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''p''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''p''<sub>''n''</sub>} the farthest-point Voronoi diagram divides the plane into cells in which the same point of ''P'' is the farthest point. A point of ''P'' has a cell in the farthest-point Voronoi diagram if and only if it is a vertex of the [[convex hull]] of ''P''. Let ''H''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{''h''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''h''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''h''<sub>''k''</sub>} be the convex hull of ''P''; then the farthest-point Voronoi diagram is a subdivision of the plane into ''k'' cells, one for each point in ''H'', with the property that a point ''q'' lies in the cell corresponding to a site ''h''<sub>''i''</sub> if and only if d(''q'', ''h''<sub>''i''</sub>) > d(''q'', ''p''<sub>''j''</sub>) for each ''p''<sub>''j''</sub>&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''S'' with ''h''<sub>''i''</sub> \u2260 ''p''<sub>''j''</sub>, where d(''p'', ''q'') is the [[Euclidean distance]] between two points ''p'' and&nbsp;''q''.<ref name=\"berg2008\">{{cite book|year=2008|title=Computational Geometry |isbn=978-3-540-77974-2 |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]]|edition=Third |first1=Mark |last1=de Berg |first2=Marc |last2=van Kreveld |first3=Mark |last3=Overmars |first4=Otfried |last4=Schwarzkopf |authorlink1=Mark de Berg |authorlink2=Marc van Kreveld |authorlink3=Mark Overmars |authorlink4=Otfried Schwarzkopf }} 7.4 Farthest-Point Voronoi Diagrams.

In the simplest case, these objects are just finitely many points in the plane (called seeds, sites, or generators). For each seed there is a corresponding region consisting of all points of the plane closer to that seed than to any other. These regions are called Voronoi cells.

In this case each site ''p''<sub>''k''</sub> is simply a point, and its corresponding Voronoi cell ''R''<sub>''k''</sub> consists of every point in the Euclidean plane whose distance to ''p''<sub>''k''</sub> is less than or equal to its distance to any other ''p''<sub>''k''</sub>. Each such cell is obtained from the intersection of [[Half-space (geometry)|half-spaces]], and hence it is a [[convex polygon]]. The [[line segment]]s of the Voronoi diagram are all the points in the plane that are equidistant to the two nearest sites.  The Voronoi vertices ([[Node (graph theory)|node]]s) are the points equidistant to three (or more) sites.\n\n==Formal definition==\nLet <math display=\"inline\"> X </math> be a [[metric space]] with distance function <math display=\"inline\">d</math>. Let <math display=\"inline\">K</math> be a set of indices and let <math display=\"inline\">(P_k)_{k \\in K}</math> be a [[tuple]] (ordered collection) of nonempty [[subsets]] (the sites) in the space <math display=\"inline\"> X</math>. The Voronoi cell, or Voronoi region,  <math display=\"inline\"> R_k</math>, associated with the site <math display=\"inline\">P_k</math> is the set of all points in <math display=\"inline\">X</math> whose distance to <math display=\"inline\"> P_k</math> is not greater than their distance to the other sites <math display=\"inline\">P_j</math>, where <math display=\"inline\">j</math> is any index different from <math display=\"inline\">k</math>. In other words, if <math display=\"inline\"> d(x,\\, A) = \\inf\\{d(x,\\, a) \\mid a \\in A\\}</math> denotes the distance between the point <math display=\"inline\">x</math> and the subset <math display=\"inline\">A</math>, then\n\n:<math> R_k = \\{x \\in X \\mid d(x, P_k) \\leq d(x, P_j)\\; \\text{for all}\\; j \\neq k\\}</math>\n\nThe Voronoi diagram is simply the [[tuple]] of cells <math display=\"inline\">(R_k)_{k \\in K} </math>. In principle, some of the sites can intersect and even coincide (an application is described below for sites representing shops), but usually they are assumed to be disjoint. In addition, infinitely many sites are allowed in the definition (this setting has  applications in [[geometry of numbers]] and [[crystallography]]), but again, in many cases only finitely many sites are considered.\n\nIn the particular case where the space is a [[finite-dimensional]] [[Euclidean space]], each site is a point, there are finitely many points and all of them are different, then the Voronoi cells are [[convex polytope]]s and they can be represented in a combinatorial way using their vertices, sides, two-dimensional faces, etc. Sometimes the induced combinatorial structure is referred to as the Voronoi diagram. However, the Voronoi cells may not be convex or even connected.\n\nIn the usual Euclidean space,  we can rewrite the formal definition in usual terms. Each Voronoi polygon <math display=\"inline\">R_k</math> is associated with a generator point  <math display=\"inline\">P_k</math>.\nLet <math display=\"inline\">X</math> be the set of all points in the Euclidean space. Let <math display=\"inline\">P_1</math> be a point that generates its Voronoi region  <math display=\"inline\">R_1</math>, <math display=\"inline\">P_2</math> that generates  <math display=\"inline\">R_2</math>, and <math display=\"inline\">P_3</math> that generates  <math display=\"inline\">R_3</math>, and so on. <!--Then,\n\n:<math> R_1 = \\{x \\in X \\mid d(x, P_1) \\leq d(x, P_2) \\;\\and\\; d(x, P_1) \\leq d(x, P_3) \\;\\and\\; \\ldots\\}</math>\n:<math> R_2 = \\{x \\in X \\mid d(x, P_2) \\leq d(x, P_1) \\;\\and\\; d(x, P_2) \\leq d(x, P_3) \\;\\and\\; \\ldots\\}</math>\n:...\n--> Then, as expressed by Tran ''et al''<ref name=\"Tran09\">{{cite book |first1=Q.

Suppose we want to estimate the number of customers of a given shop. With all else being equal (price, products, quality of service, etc.), it is reasonable to assume that customers choose their preferred shop simply by distance considerations: they will go to the shop located nearest to them. In this case the Voronoi cell <math>\\scriptstyle R_k</math> of a given shop <math>\\scriptstyle P_k</math> can be used for giving a rough estimate on the number of potential customers going to this shop (which is modeled by a point in our city).\n\nFor most cities, the distance between points can be measured using the familiar\n[[Euclidean distance]]: <math>\\ell_2 = d\\left[\\left(a_1, a_2\\right), \\left(b_1, b_2\\right)\\right] = \\sqrt{\\left(a_1 - b_1\\right)^2 + \\left(a_2 - b_2\\right)^2}</math> or the [[Manhattan distance]]:<math>d\\left[\\left(a_1, a_2\\right), \\left(b_1, b_2\\right)\\right] = \\left|a_1 - b_1\\right| + \\left|a_2 - b_2\\right|</math>. The corresponding Voronoi diagrams look different for different distance metrics.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = center\n | direction = horizontal\n | width     = 382\n | header    = Voronoi diagrams of 20 points under two different metrics\n | header_align = center\n | image1    = Euclidean Voronoi diagram.svg\n | alt1      = Voronoi diagram under Euclidean distance\n | caption1  = [[Euclidean distance]]\n | image2    = Manhattan Voronoi Diagram.svg\n | alt2      = Voronoi diagram under Manhattan distance\n | caption2  = [[Manhattan distance]]\n}}\n\n==Properties==\n* The [[dual graph]] for a Voronoi diagram (in the case of a [[Euclidean space]] with point sites) corresponds to the [[Delaunay triangulation]] for the same set of points.\n* The [[closest pair of points]] corresponds to two adjacent cells in the Voronoi diagram.\n* Assume the setting is the [[Euclidean plane]] and a group of different points is given. Then two points are adjacent on the [[convex hull]] if and only if their Voronoi cells share an infinitely long side.\n* If the space is a [[normed space]] and the distance to each site is attained (e.g., when a site is a [[compact set]] or a closed ball), then each Voronoi cell can be represented as a union of line segments emanating from the sites.<ref name=Reem_alg>{{harvnb|Reem|2009}}</ref> As shown there, this property does not necessarily hold when the distance is not attained.\n* Under relatively general conditions (the space is a possibly infinite-dimensional [[uniformly convex space]], there can be infinitely many sites of a general form, etc.) Voronoi cells enjoy a certain stability property: a small change in the shapes of the sites, e.g., a change caused by some translation or distortion, yields a small change in the shape of the Voronoi cells. This is the geometric stability of Voronoi diagrams.<ref name=Reem_geo_stable>{{harvnb|Reem|2011}}</ref> As shown there, this property does not hold in general, even if the space is two-dimensional (but non-uniformly convex, and, in particular, non-Euclidean) and the sites are points.\n\n==History and research==\nInformal use of Voronoi diagrams can be traced back to [[Descartes]] in 1644. [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]] used two-dimensional and three-dimensional Voronoi diagrams in his study of quadratic forms in 1850.\nBritish physician [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] used a Voronoi diagram in 1854 to illustrate how the majority of people who died in the [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak|Broad Street cholera outbreak]] lived closer to the infected [[Soho#Broad Street pump|Broad Street pump]] than to any other water pump.\n\nVoronoi diagrams are named after Russian mathematician [[Georgy Voronoy|Georgy Feodosievych Voronoy]] who defined and studied the general ''n''-dimensional case in 1908. Voronoi diagrams that are used in [[geophysics]] and [[meteorology]] to analyse spatially distributed data (such as rainfall measurements) are called Thiessen polygons after American meteorologist [[Alfred H. Thiessen]]. In [[condensed matter physics]], such tessellations are also known as [[Wigner\u2013Seitz unit cell]]s. Voronoi tessellations of the [[reciprocal lattice]] of [[momentum|momenta]] are called [[Brillouin zone]]s. For general lattices in [[Lie group]]s,  the cells are simply called [[fundamental domain]]s. In the case of general [[metric space]]s, the cells are often called metric [[fundamental polygon]]s.\nOther equivalent names for this concept (or particular important cases of it): Voronoi polyhedra, Voronoi polygons, domain(s) of influence, Voronoi decomposition, Voronoi tessellation(s), Dirichlet tessellation(s).\n\n==Examples==\n[[Image:Coloured Voronoi 3D slice.svg|right|thumb|This is a slice of the Voronoi diagram of a random set of points in a 3D box. In general, a cross section of a 3D Voronoi tessellation is not a 2D Voronoi tessellation itself. (The cells are all [[Convex set|convex]] [[polyhedron|polyhedra]].)]]\n\nVoronoi tessellations of regular [[Lattice (group)|lattice]]s of points in two or three dimensions give rise to many familiar tessellations.\n* A 2D lattice gives an irregular honeycomb tessellation, with equal hexagons with point symmetry; in the case of a regular triangular lattice it is regular; in the case of a rectangular lattice the hexagons reduce to rectangles in rows and columns; a [[Square (geometry)|square]] lattice gives the regular tessellation of squares; note that the rectangles and the squares can also be generated by other lattices (for example the lattice defined by the vectors (1,0) and (1/2,1/2) gives squares). See [https://mbostock.github.com/d3/ex/voronoi.html here] for a dynamic visual example.\n* A [[simple cubic lattice]] gives the [[cubic honeycomb]].\n* A [[hexagonal close-packed]] lattice gives a tessellation of space with [[trapezo-rhombic dodecahedron|trapezo-rhombic dodecahedra]].\n* A [[face-centred cubic]] lattice gives a tessellation of space with [[rhombic dodecahedron|rhombic dodecahedra]].\n* A [[body-centred cubic]] lattice gives a tessellation of space with [[truncated octahedron|truncated octahedra]].\n* Parallel planes with regular triangular lattices aligned with each other's centers give the [[hexagonal prismatic honeycomb]].\n* Certain body-centered tetragonal lattices give a tessellation of space with [[rhombo-hexagonal dodecahedron|rhombo-hexagonal dodecahedra]].\n\nFor the set of points (''x'',&nbsp;''y'') with ''x'' in a discrete set ''X'' and ''y'' in a discrete set ''Y'', we get rectangular tiles with the points not necessarily at their centers.\n\n==Higher-order Voronoi diagrams==\nAlthough a normal Voronoi cell is defined as the set of points closest to a single point in ''S'', an ''n''th-order Voronoi cell is defined as the set of points having a particular set of ''n'' points in ''S'' as its ''n'' nearest neighbors. Higher-order Voronoi diagrams also subdivide space.\n\nHigher-order Voronoi diagrams can be generated recursively.  To generate the ''n''<sup>th</sup>-order Voronoi diagram from set&nbsp;''S'', start with the (''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)<sup>th</sup>-order diagram and replace each cell generated by ''X''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{''x''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''x''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''x''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>} with a Voronoi diagram generated on the set&nbsp;''S''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''X''.\n\n===Farthest-point Voronoi diagram===\nFor a set of ''n'' points the (''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)<sup>th</sup>-order Voronoi diagram is called a farthest-point Voronoi diagram.\n\nFor a given set of points ''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{''p''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''p''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''p''<sub>''n''</sub>} the farthest-point Voronoi diagram divides the plane into cells in which the same point of ''P'' is the farthest point. A point of ''P'' has a cell in the farthest-point Voronoi diagram if and only if it is a vertex of the [[convex hull]] of ''P''. Let ''H''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{''h''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''h''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''h''<sub>''k''</sub>} be the convex hull of ''P''; then the farthest-point Voronoi diagram is a subdivision of the plane into ''k'' cells, one for each point in ''H'', with the property that a point ''q'' lies in the cell corresponding to a site ''h''<sub>''i''</sub> if and only if d(''q'', ''h''<sub>''i''</sub>) > d(''q'', ''p''<sub>''j''</sub>) for each ''p''<sub>''j''</sub>&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''S'' with ''h''<sub>''i''</sub> \u2260 ''p''<sub>''j''</sub>, where d(''p'', ''q'') is the [[Euclidean distance]] between two points ''p'' and&nbsp;''q''.<ref name=\"berg2008\">{{cite book|year=2008|title=Computational Geometry |isbn=978-3-540-77974-2 |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]]|edition=Third |first1=Mark |last1=de Berg |first2=Marc |last2=van Kreveld |first3=Mark |last3=Overmars |first4=Otfried |last4=Schwarzkopf |authorlink1=Mark de Berg |authorlink2=Marc van Kreveld |authorlink3=Mark Overmars |authorlink4=Otfried Schwarzkopf }} 7.4 Farthest-Point Voronoi Diagrams.

Notice the blended colors in the fuzzy boundary of the Voronoi cells.]]\nA [[weighted Voronoi diagram]] is the one in which the function of a pair of points to define a Voronoi cell is a distance function modified by multiplicative or additive weights assigned to generator points. In contrast to the case of Voronoi cells defined using a distance which is a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]], in this case some of the Voronoi cells  may be empty.
