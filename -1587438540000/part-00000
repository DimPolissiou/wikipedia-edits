Neither the Communists, position regarding a separate Macedonian nation nor the idea of a Yugoslav federation met with much response from the Slav population, which nurtured pro-Bulgarian sentiments. The local Communists, led by M. Satorov, splintered off from the Communist Party of Yugoslavia and joined the Bulgarian Labour Party (which was Communist), with the slogan \"One state, one party\". The subsequent dissatisfaction with the occupation authorities was due to social factors, rather than national ones.

Army stationed in Macedonia, moved back to the old borders of Bulgaria. In the early October the newly formed [[Bulgarian People's Army]] together with the [[Red Army]] reentered occupied Yugoslavia to blocking the German forces withdrawing from Greece. Yugoslav Macedonia was liberated in end of November when [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|communist Yugoslavia]] was established.

It marked the defeat of [[Bulgarian nationalism]] and  the victory of the pro-Yugoslav [[Macedonism]] in the area. As result the new Communist authorities persecuted the former collaborationists with the charges of \"[[Great Bulgaria]]n chauvinism\" and broke up all the organisations that opposed the [[Yugoslavism|Yugoslav idea]] and insisted on [[Independent Macedonia|Macedonian independence]].\n\n==Background==\nThe [[Balkan Wars]] in [[First Balkan War|1912]] and [[Second Balkan War|1913]], and the [[World War I]] (1914-1918) divided the region of Macedonia amongst the [[Kingdom of Greece]], the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] and the [[Kingdom of Serbia]]. The territory was up until that time part of the Ottoman Empire. In those days, the majority of the [[Slavic speakers in Ottoman Macedonia]] considered themselves to be a part of the [[Bulgarian Millet|Bulgarian people]].<ref>During the 20th century, Slavo-Macedonian national feeling has shifted. At the beginning of the 20th century, Slavic patriots in Macedonia felt a strong attachment to Macedonia as a multi-ethnic homeland. They imagined a Macedonian community uniting themselves with non-Slavic Macedonians... Most of these Macedonian Slavs also saw themselves as Bulgarians. By the middle of the 20th. century, however Macedonian patriots began to see Macedonian and Bulgarian loyalties as mutually exclusive. Regional Macedonian nationalism had become ethnic Macedonian nationalism... This transformation shows that the content of collective loyalties can shift.[https://books.google.com/books?id=6RveDmHbIv8C&pg=PA147 ''Region, Regional Identity and Regionalism in Southeastern Europe, Ethnologia Balkanica Series'', Klaus Roth, Ulf Brunnbauer, LIT Verlag M\u00fcnster, 2010, p. 127.], {{ISBN|3825813878}}</ref><ref>\"At the end of the World War I there were very few historians or ethnographers, who claimed that a separate Macedonian nation existed... Of those Slavs who had developed some sense of national identity, the majority probably considered themselves to be Bulgarians, although they were aware of differences between themselves and the inhabitants of Bulgaria... The question as of whether a Macedonian nation actually existed in the 1940s when a Communist Yugoslavia decided to recognize one is difficult to answer. Some observers argue that even at this time it was doubtful whether the Slavs from Macedonia considered themselves to be a nationality separate from the Bulgarians.

In the parts administred by Serbia the new authorities forced out most of the Bulgarian priests and teachers, and began implementing a forceful state-sponsored [[Serbianisation]] of Slavic-speaking Macedonians. It was occupied by Kingdom of Bulgaria during World War I between 1915 and 1918. Afterwards it was restored back to Serbia and consequently included as part of the [[Vardar Banovina]] in the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. During that period, there were two main autonomist agendas. The right-wing [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (IMRO) led by Ivan Mihailov, was in favor of the creation of a pro-Bulgarian Macedonian state under German and Italian protection.\n\nThe leftist [[IMRO (United)]] group, who merged with the communists prior to the beginning of the war, favored creation of an independent \"Soviet Macedonia\" within a Balkan Federation.

[[Svetozar Vukmanovi\u0107-Tempo]] put forward the idea of a joint [[Balkan]] Headquarters to exercise supreme control over the partisan movements in Yugoslavia, Albania, Bulgaria, and Greece. Tempo asked for recognition of the ethnic Macedonian people's right to self-determination, as well as permission for the partisans from Vardar Macedonia to extend their activity among the Slavic-speaking population in Greek Macedonia. As a result, the [[SNOF|Slavic-Macedonian National Liberation Front]] (SNOF) was established in 1943 in Greek Macedonia by ethnic Macedonian communists, members of the [[Communist Party of Greece]] (KKE).\n\nOn 11 November 1943 in the village of [[Slivovo, Republic of Macedonia|Slivovo]] the First Macedonian-Kosovo Brigade was formed out of three Macedonian battalions and one battalion from fascist Italian occupied [[Kosovo]]. Regions controlled by the partisans now included [[Debarca municipality|Debarca]], [[Mavrovo and Rostu\u0161a municipality|Mavrovo, and Rostu\u0161a]], within Italy's occupied territory.\n\nImmediately after the establishment of the free territory in western Vardar Macedonia, the German command made an incursion into the areas held by the provisional authority. The problem for the Germans was the fact that the free territory was cutting off communications between [[Skopje]] and [[Kastoria|northeastern Greece]]. After assembling two divisions and artillery units, the Macedonian forces started operations to re-capture the territory.  The struggle lasted more than two months, with the most important battles being at [[Bukovi\u0107]], [[Debarca]], [[Kicevo]] and Slivovo. The town of Kicevo was recaptured by the Germans in the beginning of November, but three days later it once again fell to Macedonian partisan hands, to be later re-captured for the second time by the German troops.\n\nThe High Command of the People's Liberation Army of Macedonia together with the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Macedonia decided to take evasive maneuvers in order to avoid total destruction of the Macedonian forces because of the overwhelming number of enemy troops engaged. Only few small units were left behind. After more than two months of constant battles, in December 1943 the Macedonian MNOV together with the CC of the CPM started a massive retreat through Prespa and after a 13-day march entered Greek Macedonia.\n\n=== Bulgarian actions in 1943 ===\n{{+rs|date=February 2020}}\n[[File:Lesev 1942.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Greeting of the former [[IMRO]] chieftain Peter Lesev by recruits of Bulgarian Army, after his appointment as a governor of [[Kratovo Municipality]] in 1943.<ref>\u041f\u0430\u043d\u0434\u043e \u041c\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0432, \u0412\u044a\u0432 \u0438 \u0438\u0437\u0432\u044a\u043d \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0438\u044f. \u0421\u043f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438, \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0442\u0440\u0438\u0431\u0443\u043d\u0430, \u0441\u0442\u0440. 58.</ref> Macedonian recruits formed up to 60% of the soldiers in Bulgarian Army in Vardar Macedonia.]]\n[[File:Counter-cheta 1943.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Members of counter-cheta in 1943.

The gendarmes became notorious for carrying out atrocities against captured partisans and their supporters{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}. Harsh rule by the occupying forces and a number of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] victories showing that the Axis might lose the war encouraged more Macedonians to support the Communist Partisan resistance movement of Josip Broz Tito.\n\nMany former IMRO members assisted the Bulgarian authorities in fighting Tempo's partisans.  With the help of the Bulgarian government and former IMRO members, several pro-Bulgarian paramilitary detachments ([[Uhrana]]) were organized in occupied Greek Macedonia in 1943.

The Partisan detachments that were active in Gevgelia and Tikvesh also crossed the border into northern Greece and met with the main forces of the MNOV. Several meetings were held with members of [[Greek People's Liberation Army|ELAS]] and the [[Greek Communist Party]]. One of the decisions was the creation of wider partisan detachments composed of the ethnic Macedonian minority in Greece. On 20 December 1943 in the village of [[Fustani]] in the [[Pella]] district of Greece, the Second Macedonian Assault Brigade was formed out of the 3 battalions of the 3rd operative zone. The Bulgarian ''Hristo Botev'' partisan battalion of the MNOV was formed out of captured and escaped Bulgarian soldiers. It was under the command of the HQ of MNOV. The rest of the fighters that were not included in the First Macedonian-Kosovo Assault Brigade and the Second Macedonian Assault Brigade (the ''Hristo Botev'' and ''Stiv Naumov'' battalion together with several smaller partisan detachments) were organized into the so-called \"Third Group of Battalions\". The provisional HQ of the reorganized MNOV was stationed in the village of Fustani in the Pella district. Because the massive concentration of MNOV troops in the Moglena district was jeopardizing the [[Axis powers|Axis]] communication to [[Thessaloniki]], Bulgarian and German forces launched an incursion against the MNOV in Moglena and at Mount Kozuv. The fighting lasted from 26 December till 18 January.

In accordance with the February March plan, on 31 January 1944 the First Macedonian-Kosovo Assault Brigade started marching towards the [[Veles (city)|Veles]] and [[Porech]] regions, but immediately after crossing the border, the Brigade was attacked by two Bulgarian divisions. After constant fighting in cold weather, on 14 February the brigade returned to [[Greek Macedonia]].

A few bands were formed in [[Veles (city)|Veles]], [[Prilep]] and [[Strumica]], mainly by war veterans and by former Chetnik leaders. These groups were few in numbers, decentralized, and some were formed under their own initiative.  By mid 1942 all of them were destroyed by units of the Bulgarian army. At the beginning of 1943, in order to organize a strong Chetnik force in Vardar Macedonia, and in order to destroy the group influenced by [[Kosta Pecanac]], [[Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107]] sent in Lieutenant [[Milivoje Trbi\u0107]]. He quickly organized local committees in [[Skopje]], Veles, [[Kicevo]] and [[Gostivar]] and started recruiting volunteers among the [[Serbs of Macedonia]]. Soon the [[Vardar Chetnik Corps]] (VCC) was formed headed by [[Stojan Krsti\u0107]] (a native of Prilep), which had about 8,000 fighters in Vardar Macedonia.<ref name=\"\u041d\u041e\u0411 \u043d\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0458\u0430\" />{{Unreliable source|date=February 2020}}\n\nAfter the formation of the first battalions of the Macedonian National Liberation Army, the VCC directed all of its efforts to destroying the liberation movement of the Macedonian people.

This stimulated anger against the Chetniks and pushed more volunteers into the ranks of the partisan army.

With detachments from Kumanovo and Skopje, he attacked the Chetniks in three battles, the most important of which occurred near the village of [[Dragomance]] at the end of 1943. This battle brought to an end the Chetnik presence in the Kumanovo region. By end of January the Chetniks in Kicevo and Skopska Crna Gora were disarmed by the MNOV.

Proponents of this option included Metodija Andonov-\u010cento, as well as prominent figures of the former IMRO (United) such as Pavel Shatev, Panko Brashnarov, and others. They saw joining Yugoslavia as a form of Serbian dominance over Macedonia, and preferred membership in a Balkan Federation or else complete independence.<ref name=\"Spyridon Sfetas\" />\n\nProponents of the \"minimalist\" line were also for the creation of a Macedonian state, but within the Yugoslavian federation.\n\nThese differences were visible in the ASNOM discussions, but they especially came into the open after the final liberation of Macedonia. It must be added that both \"maximalist\" and \"minimalist\" lines within the National Liberation Movement in Vardar Macedonia supported the existence of a separate Macedonian identity and were in favor of the creation of a separate state in which the [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonian people]] would have their homeland.

Despite that, before the autumn of 1944, the Macedonian Partisans were not significant military force. Their activity did not differ from the typically Balkan \u201c[[hajduk]]\u201d traditions as ambushes and lack of military planning. They were ill-equipped and did not have good training. The Partisans received more weapons after the [[1944 Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat of September 9, 1944]] as the Bulgarians withdrew from the area and part of their military equipment fell into Partisans' hands. Simultaneously they counted hardly ca. 8,000 man, based predominantly on then Albanian territory. It became clear in the autumn of 1944, that the Bulgarian army was the real force behind the driving the Germans out of eastern Serbia and Macedonia. Nevertheless the of\ufb01cial Yugoslav and later Macedonian historiography, has played down its role by political grounds, actually at the cost of historical [[deception]]s. \n\nFor example, according to Macedonian sources Bulgarians did not participate in the operations for the capture of Skopje in the mid of November 1944, even as observers. Once the city was seized by the guerrillas, they were not even allowed to enter it. Nevertheless the city was seized not without the decisive role of the Bulgarian troops.<ref>Livanios, Dimitris, The Macedonian Question: Britain and the Southern Balkans 1939-1949, Oxford University Publishing, 2008, {{ISBN|0191528722}}, pp. 118-141.</ref><ref>Michael Palairet, Macedonia: A Voyage through History (Vol. 2), Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2016, {{ISBN|1443888494}}, p. 212.</ref> Per German military historian Karl Hnilicka, the Bulgarians developed their advance towards Skopje into a large-scale offensive, which gave rise to the danger for Army Group E of being cut off.

Neither the Communists, position regarding a separate Macedonian nation nor the idea of a Yugoslav federation met with much response from the Slav population, which nurtured pro-Bulgarian sentiments. The local Communists, led by M. Satorov, splintered off from the Communist Party of Yugoslavia and joined the Bulgarian Labour Party (which was Communist), with the slogan \"One state, one party\". The subsequent dissatisfaction with the occupation authorities was due to social factors, rather than national ones. This was also why Tito,s resistance movement in Yugoslav Macedonia failed to develop.\"'' For more see: Spyridon Sfetas, Autonomist Movements of the Slavophones in 1944: The Attitude of the Communist Party of Greece and the Protection of the Greek-Yugoslav Border.

Army stationed in Macedonia, moved back to the old borders of Bulgaria. In the early October the newly formed [[Bulgarian People's Army]] together with the [[Red Army]] reentered occupied Yugoslavia to blocking the German forces withdrawing from Greece.

It marked the defeat of [[Bulgarian nationalism]] and  the victory of the pro-Yugoslav [[Macedonism]] in the area. As result the new Communist authorities persecuted the former collaborationists with the charges of \"[[Great Bulgaria]]n chauvinism\" and broke up all the organisations that opposed the [[Yugoslavism|Yugoslav idea]] and insisted on [[Independent Macedonia|Macedonian independence]].\n\n==Background==\nThe [[Balkan Wars]] in [[First Balkan War|1912]] and [[Second Balkan War|1913]], and the [[World War I]] (1914-1918) divided the region of Macedonia amongst the [[Kingdom of Greece]], the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] and the [[Kingdom of Serbia]]. The territory was up until that time part of the Ottoman Empire. In those days, the majority of the [[Slavic speakers in Ottoman Macedonia]] considered themselves to be a part of the [[Bulgarian Millet|Bulgarian people]].<ref>During the 20th century, Slavo-Macedonian national feeling has shifted. At the beginning of the 20th century, Slavic patriots in Macedonia felt a strong attachment to Macedonia as a multi-ethnic homeland. They imagined a Macedonian community uniting themselves with non-Slavic Macedonians... Most of these Macedonian Slavs also saw themselves as Bulgarians. By the middle of the 20th. century, however Macedonian patriots began to see Macedonian and Bulgarian loyalties as mutually exclusive. Regional Macedonian nationalism had become ethnic Macedonian nationalism... This transformation shows that the content of collective loyalties can shift.[https://books.google.com/books?id=6RveDmHbIv8C&pg=PA147 ''Region, Regional Identity and Regionalism in Southeastern Europe, Ethnologia Balkanica Series'', Klaus Roth, Ulf Brunnbauer, LIT Verlag M\u00fcnster, 2010, p. 127.], {{ISBN|3825813878}}</ref><ref>\"At the end of the World War I there were very few historians or ethnographers, who claimed that a separate Macedonian nation existed... Of those Slavs who had developed some sense of national identity, the majority probably considered themselves to be Bulgarians, although they were aware of differences between themselves and the inhabitants of Bulgaria... The question as of whether a Macedonian nation actually existed in the 1940s when a Communist Yugoslavia decided to recognize one is difficult to answer. Some observers argue that even at this time it was doubtful whether the Slavs from Macedonia considered themselves to be a nationality separate from the Bulgarians.

In the parts administred by Serbia the new authorities forced out most of the Bulgarian priests and teachers, and began implementing a forceful state-sponsored [[Serbianisation]] of Slavic-speaking Macedonians. It was occupied by Kingdom of Bulgaria during World War I between 1915 and 1918. Afterwards it was restored back to Serbia and consequently included as part of the [[Vardar Banovina]] in the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. During that period, there were two main autonomist agendas. The right-wing [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (IMRO) led by Ivan Mihailov, was in favor of the creation of a pro-Bulgarian Macedonian state under German and Italian protection.\n\nThe leftist [[IMRO (United)]] group, who merged with the communists prior to the beginning of the war, favored creation of an independent \"Soviet Macedonia\" within a Balkan Federation. This option was supported by [[Pavel Shatev]], [[Dimitar Vlahov]], [[Metodi Shatorov]], [[Panko Brashnarov]], and others.

The successful actions of the Bulgarian secret police prevented the creation of partisan units in eastern Macedonia in 1942.\n\nPartisan activity was coordinated by the Headquarters of the National Liberation Partisan Detachments of Macedonia (HQ of NLPDM), which was established in July 1942 by Macedonian communists of the CPY and was headed by [[Mihailo Apostolski]].<ref name=\"\u0412\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u0438 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0441: \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0458\u0430\" />{{Page needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==1943==\n[[File:Ustanak u Jugoslaviji 1943.png|thumb|250px|Resistance in Yugoslavia after the [[capitulation of Italy]], September 1943.

Between 1941 and 1943, Tito have sent five emissaries to Macedonia, to persuade his ill-disciplined comrades, but their efforts had limited success, and the Regional Committee was de facto under the control of the BCP.<ref>Dimitris Livanios, The Macedonian Question: Britain and the Southern Balkans 1939-1949, OUP Oxford, 2008, {{ISBN|0191528722}}, p. 121.</ref> To change that, in the beginning of 1943 the [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrin]] [[Svetozar Vukmanovi\u0107-Tempo]] was sent as an assistant to the HQ of the Macedonian partisan forces. Tempo tried  to organize an energetic struggle against the occupying forces. He was supposed to set up a Macedonian Communist Party within the framework of the Yugoslav one. One of his objectives was to destroy the influence of the BCP in Macedonia and to fight against any form of [[autonomism]]. He would have to \"Macedonianize\" the struggle\u2019s form and content,  and to give it an ethnic Macedonian facade. One of his main achievements was also that the wartime pro-Bulgarian trend receded into the background of pro-Yugoslav one. Tempo was able to capitalize on the growing contradictions towards Bulgarian authorities, which during 1942 were involved into a policy of centralization, contradicting their initial agenda to respect Macedonian autonomy. Yugoslav communists proclaimed as their aim the issue of unification of the three regions of Macedonia \u2013 Yugoslav, Greek and Bulgarian, and so managed to get also Macedonian nationalists.\n\n===Formation of the Communist Party of Macedonia (CPM)===\n{{+rs|date=February 2020}}\n[[File:Italo-Bulgarian 1941.jpg|thumb|250px|Italian and Bulgarian military on the border between Albania and Bulgaria in Macedonia in front of dismantled machine gun Schwarzlose.]]\nThe leadership of the Regional Committee of the CPY for Macedonia decided to establish a separate Macedonian Communist Party which would be representative of the will of the Macedonian people in the anti-fascist struggle for national liberation. The [[Communist Party of Macedonia]] (CPM) was formed on 19 March 1943 in Tetovo. The first Central Committee (CC of the CPM) was composed as of Yugoslav communists as [[Strahil Gigov]], [[Kuzman Josifovski Pitu]], [[Cvetko Uzunovski]], [[Mara Naceva]] and [[Bane Andreev]].<ref name=\"\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u041c\u041a\">\"\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043e\u0442 \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\" \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440 \u0421\u0442\u043e\u0458\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438, \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d \u041a\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0440\u045f\u0438\u0435\u0432, \u0414\u0430\u043d\u0447\u043e \u0417\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0441\u043a\u0438. \u0421\u043a\u043e\u043f\u0458\u0435, 1988</ref>{{Page needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nAfter making a detailed analysis of the military and political situation in the country, the CC of the CPM decided to be directly involved in the fighting and to be stationed side by side with the troops on the battlefield.  The territory of [[Vardar Macedonia]] was divided into five operative zones, and efforts were made to make direct contact with the liberation movements in Albania, Bulgaria and Greece.\n\nAdding to the existing eleven, eight new Macedonian partisan detachments were formed in the summer of 1943 as more and more people entered the ranks of the partisans. They managed to create strongholds in the regions of [[Debarca]], [[Prespa]], [[Kumanovo]], [[Tikvesh]], and [[Gevgelija]]. This allowed for the expansion of the National Liberation Committees and the creation of larger military units, as decided at a conference in Prespa on 2 August 1943. Regular large military units (battalions and brigades) were created as part of the [[People's Liberation Army of Macedonia]] (MNOV). Preparations began for the formation of the [[ASNOM|Anti-Fascist Assembly for the People's Liberation of Macedonia (ASNOM)]], which governed Macedonia from August 1944 until the end of World War II.\n\n===Formation of the People's Liberation Army of Macedonia===\n{{+rs|date=February 2020}}\n{{Main article|People's Liberation Army of Macedonia}}\n[[File:Bataljon Stiv Naumov, 1943.jpg|thumb|250px|Partisans of the battalion \"[[Stiv Naumov]]\", set up in November 1943 in [[Prespa|Gorna Prespa]].]]\nCreation of larger Macedonian military units started immediately after the Prespa conference.

[[Svetozar Vukmanovi\u0107-Tempo]] put forward the idea of a joint [[Balkan]] Headquarters to exercise supreme control over the partisan movements in Yugoslavia, Albania, Bulgaria, and Greece. Tempo asked for recognition of the ethnic Macedonian people's right to self-determination, as well as permission for the partisans from Vardar Macedonia to extend their activity among the Slavic-speaking population in Greek Macedonia. As a result, the [[SNOF|Slavic-Macedonian National Liberation Front]] (SNOF) was established in 1943 in Greek Macedonia by ethnic Macedonian communists, members of the [[Communist Party of Greece]] (KKE).\n\nOn 11 November 1943 in the village of [[Slivovo, Republic of Macedonia|Slivovo]] the First Macedonian-Kosovo Brigade was formed out of three Macedonian battalions and one battalion from fascist Italian occupied [[Kosovo]]. Regions controlled by the partisans now included [[Debarca municipality|Debarca]], [[Mavrovo and Rostu\u0161a municipality|Mavrovo, and Rostu\u0161a]], within Italy's occupied territory.\n\nImmediately after the establishment of the free territory in western Vardar Macedonia, the German command made an incursion into the areas held by the provisional authority. The problem for the Germans was the fact that the free territory was cutting off communications between [[Skopje]] and [[Kastoria|northeastern Greece]]. After assembling two divisions and artillery units, the Macedonian forces started operations to re-capture the territory.  The struggle lasted more than two months, with the most important battles being at [[Bukovi\u0107]], [[Debarca]], [[Kicevo]] and Slivovo. The town of Kicevo was recaptured by the Germans in the beginning of November, but three days later it once again fell to Macedonian partisan hands, to be later re-captured for the second time by the German troops.\n\nThe High Command of the People's Liberation Army of Macedonia together with the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Macedonia decided to take evasive maneuvers in order to avoid total destruction of the Macedonian forces because of the overwhelming number of enemy troops engaged. Only few small units were left behind. After more than two months of constant battles, in December 1943 the Macedonian MNOV together with the CC of the CPM started a massive retreat through Prespa and after a 13-day march entered Greek Macedonia.\n\n=== Bulgarian actions in 1943 ===\n{{+rs|date=February 2020}}\n[[File:Lesev 1942.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Greeting of the former [[IMRO]] chieftain Peter Lesev by recruits of Bulgarian Army, after his appointment as a governor of [[Kratovo Municipality]] in 1943.<ref>\u041f\u0430\u043d\u0434\u043e \u041c\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0432, \u0412\u044a\u0432 \u0438 \u0438\u0437\u0432\u044a\u043d \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0438\u044f. \u0421\u043f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438, \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0442\u0440\u0438\u0431\u0443\u043d\u0430, \u0441\u0442\u0440. 58.</ref> Macedonian recruits formed up to 60% of the soldiers in Bulgarian Army in Vardar Macedonia.]]\n[[File:Counter-cheta 1943.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Members of counter-cheta in 1943.

Harsh rule by the occupying forces and a number of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] victories showing that the Axis might lose the war encouraged more Macedonians to support the Communist Partisan resistance movement of Josip Broz Tito.\n\nMany former IMRO members assisted the Bulgarian authorities in fighting Tempo's partisans.  With the help of the Bulgarian government and former IMRO members, several pro-Bulgarian paramilitary detachments ([[Uhrana]]) were organized in occupied Greek Macedonia in 1943. These were led by Bulgarian officers originally from Greek Macedonia and charged with protecting the local population in the zones under German and Italian control. Around this time [[Ivan Mihailov]] of IMRO had plans which envisaged the creation of a Macedonian state under German control. He was a follower of the idea of a united Macedonian state with a dominant Bulgarian element.<ref>[http://www.vest.com.mk/default.asp?id=3372&idg=1&idb=215&rubrika=Revija Be\u0441\u043d\u0438\u043a \"\u0412\u0435\u0441\u0442\", \u0413\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430:1 \u0411\u0440\u043e\u0458:215 \u0421\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430 3/24/2001]</ref> It was anticipated by the Germans that members of IMRO would form the core of the armed forces of a future Independent Macedonia led by Ivan Mihailov.\n\n==1944 and aftermath==\n\n===February Campaign===\n{{+rs|date=February 2020}}\n[[File:Miting u oslobo\u0111enom Ki\u010devu 26.

The Partisan detachments that were active in Gevgelia and Tikvesh also crossed the border into northern Greece and met with the main forces of the MNOV. Several meetings were held with members of [[Greek People's Liberation Army|ELAS]] and the [[Greek Communist Party]]. One of the decisions was the creation of wider partisan detachments composed of the ethnic Macedonian minority in Greece. On 20 December 1943 in the village of [[Fustani]] in the [[Pella]] district of Greece, the Second Macedonian Assault Brigade was formed out of the 3 battalions of the 3rd operative zone. The Bulgarian ''Hristo Botev'' partisan battalion of the MNOV was formed out of captured and escaped Bulgarian soldiers. It was under the command of the HQ of MNOV. The rest of the fighters that were not included in the First Macedonian-Kosovo Assault Brigade and the Second Macedonian Assault Brigade (the ''Hristo Botev'' and ''Stiv Naumov'' battalion together with several smaller partisan detachments) were organized into the so-called \"Third Group of Battalions\". The provisional HQ of the reorganized MNOV was stationed in the village of Fustani in the Pella district. Because the massive concentration of MNOV troops in the Moglena district was jeopardizing the [[Axis powers|Axis]] communication to [[Thessaloniki]], Bulgarian and German forces launched an incursion against the MNOV in Moglena and at Mount Kozuv. The fighting lasted from 26 December till 18 January. All Axis attacks were repelled, and Mount Kozuf remained a free territory held by the MNOV.<ref name=\"\u041c\u0435\u0433\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\">\"\u041c\u0435\u0433\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442 \u0432\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u043e\u0441\u043b\u043e\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043d\u043e\u0442\u043e \u0434\u0432\u0438\u0436\u0435\u045a\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0415\u0433\u0435\u0458\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0458\u0430\", \u0425\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0410\u043d\u0434\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438. \u0421\u043a\u043e\u043f\u0458\u0435, 1960</ref>{{Unreliable source|date=February 2020}}<ref name=\"\u0414\u043d\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0438\u043a 1\">\u0417\u0438\u043c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0432\u043e\u0458\u0441\u043a\u0430 1943/44 \u2013 \u0420\u0430\u0434\u0435 \u0413\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432, \u043d\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b \u043d\u0430 \"\u041f\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u0437\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0441\u043f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 1941\" [http://217.16.70.245/?pbroj=1342&pr=9&stID=11928]</ref>{{Unreliable source|date=February 2020}}\n[[File:Da \u017eivi bratstvo makedonskog i albanskog naroda.jpg|thumb|250px|Albanian and Macedonian Partisans marching with a transparant.

In accordance with the February March plan, on 31 January 1944 the First Macedonian-Kosovo Assault Brigade started marching towards the [[Veles (city)|Veles]] and [[Porech]] regions, but immediately after crossing the border, the Brigade was attacked by two Bulgarian divisions. After constant fighting in cold weather, on 14 February the brigade returned to [[Greek Macedonia]]. Although it did not fulfill its mission because of the energetic counter-attacks of the Bulgarians, the First Brigade engaged two divisions of the Bulgarian 5th Army in that region. This opened a gap for the Third Group of Brigades together with CPM and the HQ of MNOV to pass through eastern Macedonia. The Second Macedonian Assault Brigade conducted incursions from 31 January till mid 1944 from [[Kozuf]] to [[Gevgelia]] and [[Demir Kapija]] regions, disrupting the Bulgarian authority in the villages and closing Bulgarian schools. On 31 January the Third Group of Brigades together with the HQ of the MNOV and the CC of the CPM started marching from the village of Zborsko to eastern Vardar Macedonia. 23 days later, after 400&nbsp;km of travel through five mountain ranges in terrible weather and constant engagements with Bulgarian army units, the Third Group of Battalions was in partisan held territory near [[Kumanovo]].

A few bands were formed in [[Veles (city)|Veles]], [[Prilep]] and [[Strumica]], mainly by war veterans and by former Chetnik leaders. These groups were few in numbers, decentralized, and some were formed under their own initiative.  By mid 1942 all of them were destroyed by units of the Bulgarian army. At the beginning of 1943, in order to organize a strong Chetnik force in Vardar Macedonia, and in order to destroy the group influenced by [[Kosta Pecanac]], [[Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107]] sent in Lieutenant [[Milivoje Trbi\u0107]]. He quickly organized local committees in [[Skopje]], Veles, [[Kicevo]] and [[Gostivar]] and started recruiting volunteers among the [[Serbs of Macedonia]]. Soon the [[Vardar Chetnik Corps]] (VCC) was formed headed by [[Stojan Krsti\u0107]] (a native of Prilep), which had about 8,000 fighters in Vardar Macedonia.<ref name=\"\u041d\u041e\u0411 \u043d\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0458\u0430\" />{{Unreliable source|date=February 2020}}\n\nAfter the formation of the first battalions of the Macedonian National Liberation Army, the VCC directed all of its efforts to destroying the liberation movement of the Macedonian people.

This stimulated anger against the Chetniks and pushed more volunteers into the ranks of the partisan army. In December 1943 the High Command gave [[Hristijan Todorovski Karpo\u0161]] the task of destroying the Chetniks in the [[Skopska Crna Gora]] region in Skopje and [[Kozjak (Kumanovo)|Kozjak]] in [[Kumanovo]]. With detachments from Kumanovo and Skopje, he attacked the Chetniks in three battles, the most important of which occurred near the village of [[Dragomance]] at the end of 1943. This battle brought to an end the Chetnik presence in the Kumanovo region. By end of January the Chetniks in Kicevo and Skopska Crna Gora were disarmed by the MNOV.

Also, the Vardar Chetnik Corps started a massive attack on the Partisans, which made the situation even worse.\n\nAt the end of January 1944, the High Command of the MNOV decided to launch an offensive, with the intention of destroying the VCC. On 29 February 1944 the partisans of the Third Macedonian Assault Brigade attacked the Chetnik flanks from north, west and south, while the Hristo Botev detachment hit the Chetniks from the east.

Despite that, before the autumn of 1944, the Macedonian Partisans were not significant military force. Their activity did not differ from the typically Balkan \u201c[[hajduk]]\u201d traditions as ambushes and lack of military planning. They were ill-equipped and did not have good training. The Partisans received more weapons after the [[1944 Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat of September 9, 1944]] as the Bulgarians withdrew from the area and part of their military equipment fell into Partisans' hands. Simultaneously they counted hardly ca. 8,000 man, based predominantly on then Albanian territory. It became clear in the autumn of 1944, that the Bulgarian army was the real force behind the driving the Germans out of eastern Serbia and Macedonia. Nevertheless the of\ufb01cial Yugoslav and later Macedonian historiography, has played down its role by political grounds, actually at the cost of historical [[deception]]s. \n\nFor example, according to Macedonian sources Bulgarians did not participate in the operations for the capture of Skopje in the mid of November 1944, even as observers.

By 2012, the VDC had largely increased in size and its population reached more than 10000 approximately. The village is divided into two areas: the bajar and the gaun. Birendra highway passes through the Bajar which has Chandranigahpur on the north connecting the East-West highway and Gaur on the south which is on the Nepal-India Border. The VDC gained its fortune after the Birendra Highway was constructed. After the highway construction, developments and infrastructures followed around the VDC areas.

With the establishment of the sugar industry, farmers had opportunity to open business with the factory. They increased their sugarcane farming and sold it to the factory in their backyard. The factory provided jobs and opened sources of business in the VDC.  Hence, today the VDC is a fast-growing town with every business one can name. It is the center of business in the area with few banks, five-six petrol pumps, hundreds of Grocery stores, handful of Shopping centers, small granary and Eating-oil mills, shoes factory, a High school, several restaurants, clinics and Elaka police Station. It has highest economic rate among all villages in its districts. Some of the major castes like Jaiswal,Sharma,etc are well known for their business standard in Garuda.

It is the feature full-length directorial debut of American director, producer, and screenwriter [[Steven Spielberg]], and is distributed by [[Universal Pictures]].\n\n[[Dennis Weaver]] portrays David Mann, a business commuter from California driving a [[Plymouth Valiant]] while on his way to meet a client. He soon finds himself chased by the mostly unseen driver of a rusted [[Peterbilt 281]] who chases and terrorizes Mann after Mann overtakes him.\n\nOriginally aired as a [[television film]] as part of the ''[[ABC Movie of the Week]]'' series on November 13, 1971, ''Duel'' later received an international theatrical release in an extended version featuring scenes shot after the film's original broadcast. It has since become a [[Cult film|cult classic]].\n\n==Plot==\nDavid Mann is a middle-aged salesman driving on a business trip. He encounters a dilapidated [[tank truck]] in the [[Mojave Desert]]. Mann passes the truck, but the truck speeds up and roars past him. When Mann overtakes and passes it again, the truck blasts its horn. Mann leaves it in the distance.\n\nMann pulls into a [[gas station]], and shortly afterward the truck arrives and parks next to him. Mann phones his wife, who is upset with him after an argument the previous night. The station attendant tells Mann he needs a new [[radiator hose]], but Mann disbelieves the attendant's sincerity and declines the repair.\n[[File:Dueltruckfront.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Peterbilt 281]] tanker truck]]\n[[File:Duelweaver.jpg|right|thumb|David Mann (Dennis Weaver) being chased by the truck]]\nBack on the road, the truck catches up, passes, then blocks Mann's path each time he attempts to pass. After antagonizing Mann for some time, the driver waves him past but Mann nearly hits an oncoming vehicle. Mann then passes the truck using an unpaved [[Single track road|turnout]] next to the highway, then glances at his rear window and waves as the speed of the truck decreases.\n\nThe truck then tailgates Mann's car at increasingly high speed. Mann swerves his car off the road, loses control, and crashes sideways into a fence across from a diner as the truck continues down the road. Mann then enters the restaurant to compose himself. Upon returning from the restroom, he sees the truck parked outside. He studies the patrons and confronts one he believes to be the truck driver. The offended patron beats Mann and leaves in a smaller and older, light blue truck. The pursuing truck leaves the diner seconds later, indicating that its driver had never entered the premises.\n\nMann leaves the diner and soon stops to help a stranded school bus, but his front bumper gets caught underneath the bus's rear bumper. The truck appears at the end of a tunnel, causing Mann to panic. He and the bus driver then free his car and Mann drives from the scene as the truck helps push the school bus onto the road. Shortly after, down the road, Mann stops at a railroad crossing waiting for a freight train to pass through. The truck appears from behind and pushes Mann's car towards the oncoming freight train. The train passes, and Mann crosses the tracks and pulls over. The truck continues down the road and Mann slowly follows.\n\nIn an attempt to create more distance between him and the truck, Mann drives at a very leisurely pace, as other motorists pass him. Once again, he encounters the truck, which has pulled off to the side of the road ahead, intentionally waiting for Mann. He pulls out in front of him and starts antagonizing him again.\n\nMann stops at a gas station/roadside animal attraction to call the police and replace his radiator hose, but when he steps into the [[phone booth]], the truck drives into it, but Mann jumps clear just in time. The station owner cries out as the truck destroys her animals' cages. Mann jumps into his car and speeds away. Around a corner, he pulls off the road, hiding behind an embankment as the truck drives past.\n\nAfter a long wait, Mann heads off again, but the truck is waiting for him again down the road. Mann attempts to speed past, but it moves across the road, blocking him. Mann seeks help from an elderly couple in a car, but they flee when the truck backs up towards them at high speed. The truck stops before hitting Mann's car; Mann speeds past the truck, which begins pursuing. Mann swerves towards what he believes is a police car, only to see it is a pest-control vehicle. The truck chases him up a mountain range. The faulty radiator hose of Mann's car breaks, causing the strained engine to overheat and begin failing. Losing speed, he barely reaches the summit but then coasts downhill in neutral as the truck follows.\n\nMann spins out and crashes into a cliff wall, barely escaping being crushed by the truck. He manages to restart his car, then drive up a dirt road with the truck following him. He turns to face the truck in front of a canyon, locks the accelerator using his briefcase, then steers the car into the oncoming truck, jumping free at the last moment. The truck hits the car which bursts into flames, obscuring the driver's view. The truck plunges over the cliff, along with the car, as the driver sounds the truck's horn. Above the wreckage, Mann celebrates.

In particular, sequences were filmed on the [[Sierra Highway]], Agua Dulce Canyon Road, [[Soledad Canyon]] Road, and [[Angeles Forest Highway]]. Many of the landmarks from ''Duel'' still exist today, including the [[Figueroa Street Tunnels|tunnel]], the railroad crossing, and Chuck's Caf\u00e9, where Mann stops for a break. The building is still on Sierra Highway and has housed a French restaurant called Le Chene since 1980.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lechene.com/|title=Le Chene French Cuisine|accessdate=January 9, 2009|publisher=lechene.com}}</ref> The \"Snakerama\" gas station (now the Peppertree market) seen in the film also appears in Spielberg's comedy film ''[[1941 (film)|1941]]'' (1979) as a tribute to ''Duel'', with actress [[Lucille Benson]] again appearing as the proprietor. The cliffs where the truck crashes at the end are Mystery Mesa, off Vasquez Canyon Road.\n\nProduction of the television film was overseen by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s director of movies of the week [[Lillian Gallo]].<ref name=thr>{{cite news|title=Lillian Gallo, Pioneering TV Producer, Dies at 84 |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/lillian-gallo-pioneering-tv-producer-338693 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=June 18, 2012 |accessdate=June 26, 2012}}</ref> The original made-for-television version was 74 minutes long with filming completed in 13 days (three longer than the scheduled 10 days), leaving 10 days for editing prior to broadcast as the ''ABC Movie of the Week''. Following ''Duel''{{'}}s successful TV airing, Universal released the film overseas in 1972. The TV movie was not long enough for theatrical release, so Universal had Spielberg spend two days filming several new scenes, turning ''Duel'' into a 90-minute film. The new scenes were set at the railroad crossing and the school bus, as well as the scene of Mann talking to his wife on the telephone. A longer opening sequence was added with the car backing out of a garage and driving through the city. Expletives were also added, to make the film sound less like a television production.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nSpielberg lobbied to have Dennis Weaver in the starring role because he admired Weaver's work in [[Orson Welles]]' ''[[Touch of Evil]]''.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> Weaver repeats one of his lines from ''Touch of Evil'', telling the truck driver in the cafe that he has \"another think coming.\" This phrase is commonly misstated as \"another thing coming\", as Weaver's character did in ''Touch of Evil''.<ref>{{cite news|first=Linda |last=Wertheimer |title=Another Think Coming?

Throughout the film, the driver of the truck remains anonymous and unseen, with the exception of three separate shots, where the stunt driver can be seen in the truck's cab, where his arm waves Weaver on into oncoming traffic, and where Weaver observes the driver's snakeskin boots. His motives for targeting Weaver's character are never revealed, but the truck had numberplates from numerous states. Spielberg says that the effect of not seeing the driver makes the real villain of the film the truck itself, rather than the driver. The terrifying sound effects as the truck plunges to destruction have a supernatural feel, implying a possible diabolic presence.\n\n===Vehicles===\n\n[[File:The two different trucks used in filming. .jpg|thumb|Comparison of the two different trucks used in filming]]\nThe car was carefully chosen, a red [[Plymouth Valiant]], although three cars were used in the actual production of the movie.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autofoundry.com/5772/the-truck-from-the-movie-duel/ |title=The Truck from the Movie Duel |publisher=autofoundry.com |date=October 1, 2014 |accessdate=August 12, 2017 }}</ref> \n\n[[File:Comparison photo of the two trucks used for filming. .jpg|thumb]]\nThe original release of ''Duel'' featured a 1970 model with a [[Chrysler LA engine|318 V-8 engine]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autofoundry.com/5772/the-truck-from-the-movie-duel/ |title=The Truck from the Movie Duel |publisher=autofoundry.com |date=October 1, 2014 |accessdate=August 15, 2017 }}</ref> and \"Plymouth\" spelled out in block letters across the hood, as well as trunk lid treatment characteristic of the 1970 model; a 1971 model with a 225 [[Chrysler Slant-6 engine|Slant Six]] was also used.<ref>''[https://drivetribe.com/p/duel-plymouth-valiant-M5Zrk4EXTO6kWAPcfRFR0g?iid=fwTpYhTfQG-Q1PeI74Iuhg ''drivetribe.com'']''</ref> When the film was released in theaters and scenes were added, a 1972 model with a 225 Slant Six was added, with the \"Plymouth\" name on the hood as one emblem. All the Valiants were equipped with a [[TorqueFlite]] automatic transmission.\n\n[[File:Peterbilt 281 and Peterbilt 351..jpg|thumb|]]\nSpielberg did not care what kind of car was used in the film, but insisted the final chosen model be red to enable the vehicle to stand out from the general landscape in the wide shots of the desert highway.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nSpielberg had what he called an \"audition\" for the truck, wherein he viewed a series of trucks to choose the one for the film. He selected the older 1955 [[Peterbilt 281]] over the current flat-nosed \"[[cab-over]]\" style of trucks because the long hood of the Peterbilt, its split windshield, and its round headlights gave it more of a \"face\", adding to its menacing personality.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> Additionally, Spielberg said that the multiple license plates on the front bumper of the Peterbilt subtly suggested that the truck driver is a serial killer, having \"run down other drivers in other states\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> For each shot, several people were tasked to make it uglier; each successively adding oil, grease, fake dead insects and other blemishes.<ref name=\"DVDSpie\">{{cite AV media |date=2004 |title=Duel Collector's Edition |chapter=A Conversation with Steven Spielberg |medium=DVD |time= |location= |publisher= }}</ref>\n\nThe truck had twin rear axles, a CAT 1674 turbocharged engine with a 13-speed transmission, making it capable of hauling loads over 30 tons and top speeds reaching 75\u201380&nbsp;mph. During the original filming, the crew only had one truck, so the shots of the truck falling off the cliff had to be completed in one take.<ref name=\"DVDSpie\"/> For the film's theatrical release, two additional trucks were purchased in order to film the additional scenes that were not in the original made-for-television version (the scene where David telephones his wife, the school bus scene and the railroad crossing scene). \n\nOne of these, a 1964 Peterbilt 351, virtually identical to the original truck except for its air intake, roof mounted horn position, brake lines between the tractor and trailer, mud flaps on the back of the twin rear tyres and a support shelf for the air conditioning unit, was later destroyed in another movie production. The other truck, a 1960 Peterbilt 281, has survived. It was kept and prepared as a back up for the 351 truck, but wasn't used.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fan site for trucks used in film|url=http://www.stlouisdumptrucks.com/Duel/index.html |accessdate=September 3, 2011}}</ref> It has changed ownership several times and is currently owned by a truck collector, on display at Brad's Trucks in [[North Carolina]].<ref>{{cite web| title=The Surviving Duel Truck| url=http://www.bradsclassictrucks.com/DuelPage.htm| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317155851/http://www.bradsclassictrucks.com/DuelPage.htm| url-status=dead| archive-date=March 17, 2010| accessdate=September 3, 2011| df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nApart from a few mechanical differences, the trucks also exhibited visual differences. The older Peterbilt 281 had more dents and bumps, while the Peterbilt 351 had less wear and tear and straighter edges all round. The Peterbilt 351 was weathered slightly darker, with more of a rust effect. It also has a Peterbilt maker's badge on both sides of the bonnet nose, while the Peterbilt 281 seen in the film does not carry such a badge. <ref>https://archive.org/details/DUEL71ABCTV</ref>\n\nStock footage of both vehicles was later used in an episode of the television series ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'', titled \"Never Give a Trucker an Even Break\". Spielberg was not happy about this, but the usage was legal, as the show was produced by Universal and the ''Duel'' contract said nothing about reusing the footage in other Universal productions.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Steven Spielberg: A Biography | last=Jackson |first=Kathi |page=18 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2007}}</ref>\n\n\n\n=== Use of Sound ===\nThroughout the film, there is very little dialogue given to Matheson's character, David Mann and absolutely none whatsoever to the antagonistic truck driver, instead, as stated in his post-film documentary, Spielberg wanted to let the vehicles and setting \"speak\" for themselves. Duel, being filmed on a tight schedule and based on a short story, needed to fill in the 75 minute time space for the television debut, therefore the film was centered on the visuals and menacing audio. There was a break, however, in the silence and heavy roar of the two vehicles after the initial chase scene when Mann had crashed into a fence post just outside of Chuck's. Mann went inside to use the restroom and the audience was now introduced to his inner thoughts while he was simultaneously washing up from the crash. This diegetic use of  sound was explained by Spielberg as Mann wanting to \"physicalize\" and \"emote\" his feelings, giving the audience an intimate relationship now with Dennis Weaver's character. The use of sound, or lack thereof, was a tactic used by Spielberg to \"keep the audience in suspense\" throughout the entirety of the film, a trait that he said he was inspired to use from Alfred Hitchcock. According to Spielberg, \"sound has to fit like a glove...it makes everything scarier\", which was applied towards the end of the film when Mann is asleep at the wheel but he is awakened at the sound of what appeared to be the truck, but was revealed to actually be a passing train, giving the audience the anxiety that this was going to be a major turning point. Along with the natural sounds kept in the film, Steven Spielberg also incorporated a minimal score, composed by Billy Goldenberg.\n\n===Music===\nThe film's original score was composed by [[Billy Goldenberg]], who had previously written the music for Spielberg's segment of the ''Night Gallery'' pilot and his ''[[Columbo]]'' episode \"Murder by the Book,\" and co-scored Spielberg's ''The Name of the Game'' episode \"L.A. 2017\" with [[Robert Prince (composer)|Robert Prince]]. Spielberg and ''Duel'' producer [[George Eckstein]] told him that because of the short production schedule, he would have to write the music during filming, and Goldenberg visited the production on location at [[Soledad Canyon]] to help get an idea of what would be required. Spielberg then had Goldenberg ride in the tanker truck being driven by stunt driver Carey Loftin on several occasions; the experience terrified the composer, although he did eventually get used to it. Goldenberg then composed the score in about a week, for strings, harp, keyboards and heavy use of percussion instruments, with Moog synthesiser effects but eschewing brass and woodwinds. He then worked with the music editors to \"pick from all the pieces (they) had and cut it together (with the sound effects and dialogue).\" Much of his score was ultimately not used in the finished film.<ref>Jon Burlingame, pp. 297-298, ''TV's Biggest Hits: The Story Of Television Themes From \"[[Dragnet (1951 TV series)|Dragnet]]\" To \"[[Friends]]\"'', Schirmer Books, 1996, {{ISBN|0-02-870324-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intrada.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=6594|title=Intrada Soundtrack Forum \u2022 View topic - INTRADA Announces Billy Goldenberg's DUEL|publisher=}}</ref> In 2015 [[Intrada Records]] released a limited edition album featuring the complete score, plus four radio source music tracks composed by Goldenberg.\n\n==Release==\n''Duel'' was initially shown on American television as an ''[[ABC Movie of the Week]]'' installment.

It is the feature full-length directorial debut of American director, producer, and screenwriter [[Steven Spielberg]], and is distributed by [[Universal Pictures]].\n\n[[Dennis Weaver]] portrays David Mann, a business commuter from California driving a [[Plymouth Valiant]] while on his way to meet a client. He soon finds himself chased by the mostly unseen driver of a rusted [[Peterbilt 281]] who chases and terrorizes Mann after Mann overtakes him.\n\nOriginally aired as a [[television film]] as part of the ''[[ABC Movie of the Week]]'' series on November 13, 1971, ''Duel'' later received an international theatrical release in an extended version featuring scenes shot after the film's original broadcast. It has since become a [[Cult film|cult classic]].\n\n==Plot==\nDavid Mann is a middle-aged salesman driving on a business trip. He encounters a dilapidated [[tank truck]] in the [[Mojave Desert]]. Mann passes the truck, but the truck speeds up and roars past him. When Mann overtakes and passes it again, the truck blasts its horn. Mann leaves it in the distance.\n\nMann pulls into a [[gas station]], and shortly afterward the truck arrives and parks next to him. Mann phones his wife, who is upset with him after an argument the previous night. The station attendant tells Mann he needs a new [[radiator hose]], but Mann disbelieves the attendant's sincerity and declines the repair.\n[[File:Dueltruckfront.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Peterbilt 281]] tanker truck]]\n[[File:Duelweaver.jpg|right|thumb|David Mann (Dennis Weaver) being chased by the truck]]\nBack on the road, the truck catches up, passes, then blocks Mann's path each time he attempts to pass. After antagonizing Mann for some time, the driver waves him past but Mann nearly hits an oncoming vehicle. Mann then passes the truck using an unpaved [[Single track road|turnout]] next to the highway, then glances at his rear window and waves as the speed of the truck decreases.\n\nThe truck then tailgates Mann's car at increasingly high speed. Mann swerves his car off the road, loses control, and crashes sideways into a fence across from a diner as the truck continues down the road. Mann then enters the restaurant to compose himself. Upon returning from the restroom, he sees the truck parked outside. He studies the patrons and confronts one he believes to be the truck driver. The offended patron beats Mann and leaves in a smaller and older, light blue truck. The pursuing truck leaves the diner seconds later, indicating that its driver had never entered the premises.\n\nMann leaves the diner and soon stops to help a stranded school bus, but his front bumper gets caught underneath the bus's rear bumper. The truck appears at the end of a tunnel, causing Mann to panic. He and the bus driver then free his car and Mann drives from the scene as the truck helps push the school bus onto the road. Shortly after, down the road, Mann stops at a railroad crossing waiting for a freight train to pass through. The truck appears from behind and pushes Mann's car towards the oncoming freight train. The train passes, and Mann crosses the tracks and pulls over. The truck continues down the road and Mann slowly follows.\n\nIn an attempt to create more distance between him and the truck, Mann drives at a very leisurely pace, as other motorists pass him. Once again, he encounters the truck, which has pulled off to the side of the road ahead, intentionally waiting for Mann. He pulls out in front of him and starts antagonizing him again.\n\nMann stops at a gas station/roadside animal attraction to call the police and replace his radiator hose, but when he steps into the [[phone booth]], the truck drives into it, but Mann jumps clear just in time. The station owner cries out as the truck destroys her animals' cages. Mann jumps into his car and speeds away. Around a corner, he pulls off the road, hiding behind an embankment as the truck drives past.\n\nAfter a long wait, Mann heads off again, but the truck is waiting for him again down the road. Mann attempts to speed past, but it moves across the road, blocking him. Mann seeks help from an elderly couple in a car, but they flee when the truck backs up towards them at high speed. The truck stops before hitting Mann's car; Mann speeds past the truck, which begins pursuing. Mann swerves towards what he believes is a police car, only to see it is a pest-control vehicle. The truck chases him up a mountain range. The faulty radiator hose of Mann's car breaks, causing the strained engine to overheat and begin failing. Losing speed, he barely reaches the summit but then coasts downhill in neutral as the truck follows.\n\nMann spins out and crashes into a cliff wall, barely escaping being crushed by the truck. He manages to restart his car, then drive up a dirt road with the truck following him. He turns to face the truck in front of a canyon, locks the accelerator using his briefcase, then steers the car into the oncoming truck, jumping free at the last moment. The truck hits the car which bursts into flames, obscuring the driver's view. The truck plunges over the cliff, along with the car, as the driver sounds the truck's horn. Above the wreckage, Mann celebrates. He then sits at the cliff's edge and throws stones into the canyon as the sun begins to set.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Dennis Weaver]] as David Mann\n*[[Jacqueline Scott]] as Mrs. Mann\n*[[Carey Loftin]] as Truck Driver\n*[[Eddie Firestone]] as Caf\u00e9 Owner\n*[[Lou Frizzell]] as Bus Driver\n*[[Eugene Dynarski]] as Man in Caf\u00e9\n*[[Lucille Benson]] as Lady at Snakerama\n*[[Tim Herbert]] as Gas Station Attendant\n*[[Charles Seel]] as Old Man\n*[[Shirley O'Hara]] as Waitress\n*[[Alexander Lockwood]] as Jim, Old Man in Car\n*[[Amy Douglass]] as Old Woman in Car\n*[[Sweet Dick Whittington]] as Radio Interviewer\n*[[Dale Van Sickel]] as Car Driver\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe script is adapted by [[Richard Matheson]] from his own short story, originally published in ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine. Matheson got the inspiration for the story when he was tailgated by a trucker while on his way home from a golfing match with friend [[Jerry Sohl]] on November 22, 1963, the same day as the [[John F. Kennedy assassination]].<ref name=\"DVDMath\">{{cite AV media |date=2004 |title=Duel Collector's Edition |chapter=Richard Matheson: The Writing of Duel |medium=DVD |time= |location= |publisher= }}</ref> After a series of unsuccessful attempts to pitch the idea as an episode for various television series, he decided to write it as a short story instead.<ref name=\"DVDMath\"/> In preparation for writing the story, he drove from his home to [[Ventura, California|Ventura]] and recorded everything he saw on a tape recorder.<ref name=\"DVDMath\"/>\n\nThe original short story was given to Spielberg by his secretary, who told him that it was being made into a ''[[ABC Movie of the Week|Movie of the Week]]'' for [[American Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] and suggested he apply to be the director.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Duel: Special Edition DVD (2005)</ref> ''Duel'' was Spielberg's second feature-length directing effort, after his 1971 ''[[The Name of the Game (TV series)|The Name of the Game]]'' NBC television series episode \"[[L.A. 2017]]\".\n\nMuch of the movie was filmed in and around the communities of [[Canyon Country, Santa Clarita, California|Canyon Country]], [[Agua Dulce, California|Agua Dulce]], and [[Acton, California]]. In particular, sequences were filmed on the [[Sierra Highway]], Agua Dulce Canyon Road, [[Soledad Canyon]] Road, and [[Angeles Forest Highway]]. Many of the landmarks from ''Duel'' still exist today, including the [[Figueroa Street Tunnels|tunnel]], the railroad crossing, and Chuck's Caf\u00e9, where Mann stops for a break. The building is still on Sierra Highway and has housed a French restaurant called Le Chene since 1980.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lechene.com/|title=Le Chene French Cuisine|accessdate=January 9, 2009|publisher=lechene.com}}</ref> The \"Snakerama\" gas station (now the Peppertree market) seen in the film also appears in Spielberg's comedy film ''[[1941 (film)|1941]]'' (1979) as a tribute to ''Duel'', with actress [[Lucille Benson]] again appearing as the proprietor. The cliffs where the truck crashes at the end are Mystery Mesa, off Vasquez Canyon Road.\n\nProduction of the television film was overseen by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s director of movies of the week [[Lillian Gallo]].<ref name=thr>{{cite news|title=Lillian Gallo, Pioneering TV Producer, Dies at 84 |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/lillian-gallo-pioneering-tv-producer-338693 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=June 18, 2012 |accessdate=June 26, 2012}}</ref> The original made-for-television version was 74 minutes long with filming completed in 13 days (three longer than the scheduled 10 days), leaving 10 days for editing prior to broadcast as the ''ABC Movie of the Week''. Following ''Duel''{{'}}s successful TV airing, Universal released the film overseas in 1972. The TV movie was not long enough for theatrical release, so Universal had Spielberg spend two days filming several new scenes, turning ''Duel'' into a 90-minute film. The new scenes were set at the railroad crossing and the school bus, as well as the scene of Mann talking to his wife on the telephone. A longer opening sequence was added with the car backing out of a garage and driving through the city. Expletives were also added, to make the film sound less like a television production.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nSpielberg lobbied to have Dennis Weaver in the starring role because he admired Weaver's work in [[Orson Welles]]' ''[[Touch of Evil]]''.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> Weaver repeats one of his lines from ''Touch of Evil'', telling the truck driver in the cafe that he has \"another think coming.\" This phrase is commonly misstated as \"another thing coming\", as Weaver's character did in ''Touch of Evil''.<ref>{{cite news|first=Linda |last=Wertheimer |title=Another Think Coming?

Throughout the film, the driver of the truck remains anonymous and unseen, with the exception of three separate shots, where the stunt driver can be seen in the truck's cab, where his arm waves Weaver on into oncoming traffic, and where Weaver observes the driver's snakeskin boots. His motives for targeting Weaver's character are never revealed, but the truck had numberplates from numerous states. Spielberg says that the effect of not seeing the driver makes the real villain of the film the truck itself, rather than the driver. The terrifying sound effects as the truck plunges to destruction have a supernatural feel, implying a possible diabolic presence.\n\n===Vehicles===\n\n[[File:The two different trucks used in filming. .jpg|thumb|Comparison of the two different trucks used in filming]]\nThe car was carefully chosen, a red [[Plymouth Valiant]], although three cars were used in the actual production of the movie.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autofoundry.com/5772/the-truck-from-the-movie-duel/ |title=The Truck from the Movie Duel |publisher=autofoundry.com |date=October 1, 2014 |accessdate=August 12, 2017 }}</ref> \n\n[[File:Comparison photo of the two trucks used for filming. .jpg|thumb]]\nThe original release of ''Duel'' featured a 1970 model with a [[Chrysler LA engine|318 V-8 engine]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autofoundry.com/5772/the-truck-from-the-movie-duel/ |title=The Truck from the Movie Duel |publisher=autofoundry.com |date=October 1, 2014 |accessdate=August 15, 2017 }}</ref> and \"Plymouth\" spelled out in block letters across the hood, as well as trunk lid treatment characteristic of the 1970 model; a 1971 model with a 225 [[Chrysler Slant-6 engine|Slant Six]] was also used.<ref>''[https://drivetribe.com/p/duel-plymouth-valiant-M5Zrk4EXTO6kWAPcfRFR0g?iid=fwTpYhTfQG-Q1PeI74Iuhg ''drivetribe.com'']''</ref> When the film was released in theaters and scenes were added, a 1972 model with a 225 Slant Six was added, with the \"Plymouth\" name on the hood as one emblem. All the Valiants were equipped with a [[TorqueFlite]] automatic transmission.\n\n[[File:Peterbilt 281 and Peterbilt 351..jpg|thumb|]]\nSpielberg did not care what kind of car was used in the film, but insisted the final chosen model be red to enable the vehicle to stand out from the general landscape in the wide shots of the desert highway.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nSpielberg had what he called an \"audition\" for the truck, wherein he viewed a series of trucks to choose the one for the film. He selected the older 1955 [[Peterbilt 281]] over the current flat-nosed \"[[cab-over]]\" style of trucks because the long hood of the Peterbilt, its split windshield, and its round headlights gave it more of a \"face\", adding to its menacing personality.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> Additionally, Spielberg said that the multiple license plates on the front bumper of the Peterbilt subtly suggested that the truck driver is a serial killer, having \"run down other drivers in other states\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> For each shot, several people were tasked to make it uglier; each successively adding oil, grease, fake dead insects and other blemishes.<ref name=\"DVDSpie\">{{cite AV media |date=2004 |title=Duel Collector's Edition |chapter=A Conversation with Steven Spielberg |medium=DVD |time= |location= |publisher= }}</ref>\n\nThe truck had twin rear axles, a CAT 1674 turbocharged engine with a 13-speed transmission, making it capable of hauling loads over 30 tons and top speeds reaching 75\u201380&nbsp;mph. During the original filming, the crew only had one truck, so the shots of the truck falling off the cliff had to be completed in one take.<ref name=\"DVDSpie\"/> For the film's theatrical release, though, two additional trucks were purchased in order to film the additional scenes that were not in the original made-for-television version (the scene where David telephones his wife, the school bus scene and the railroad crossing scene). \n\nOne of these, a 1964 Peterbilt 351, virtually identical to the original truck except for its air intake, roof mounted horn position, brake lines between the tractor and trailer, mud flaps on the back of the twin rear tyres and a support shelf for the air conditioning unit, was later destroyed in another movie production. Only one of those trucks has survived, a 1960 Peterbilt 281 that was kept and prepared as a back up truck for the 351 truck, but wasn't used.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fan site for trucks used in film|url=http://www.stlouisdumptrucks.com/Duel/index.html |accessdate=September 3, 2011}}</ref>\n\nApart from a few mechanical differences, the trucks also exhibited visual differences. The older Peterbilt 281 had more dents and bumps, while the Peterbilt 351 had less wear and tear and straighter edges all round. The Peterbilt 351 was weathered slightly darker, with more of a rust effect. It also has a Peterbilt maker's badge on both sides of the bonnet nose, while the Peterbilt 281 seen in the film does not carry such a badge. <ref>https://archive.org/details/DUEL71ABCTV</ref>\n\nStock footage of both vehicles was later used in an episode of the television series ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'', titled \"Never Give a Trucker an Even Break\". Spielberg was not happy about this, but the usage was legal, as the show was produced by Universal and the ''Duel'' contract said nothing about reusing the footage in other Universal productions.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Steven Spielberg: A Biography | last=Jackson |first=Kathi |page=18 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2007}}</ref>\n\nThe 1960 Peterbilt 281 truck was purchased several times.

Duel, being filmed on a tight schedule and based on a short story, needed to fill in the 75 minute time space for the television debut, therefore the film was centered on the visuals and menacing audio. There was a break, however, in the silence and heavy roar of the two vehicles after the initial chase scene when Mann had crashed into a fence post just outside of Chuck's. Mann went inside to use the restroom and the audience was now introduced to his inner thoughts while he was simultaneously washing up from the crash. This diegetic use of  sound was explained by Spielberg as Mann wanting to \"physicalize\" and \"emote\" his feelings, giving the audience an intimate relationship now with Dennis Weaver's character. The use of sound, or lack thereof, was a tactic used by Spielberg to \"keep the audience in suspense\" throughout the entirety of the film, a trait that he said he was inspired to use from Alfred Hitchcock. According to Spielberg, \"sound has to fit like a glove...it makes everything scarier\", which was applied towards the end of the film when Mann is asleep at the wheel but he is awakened at the sound of what appeared to be the truck, but was revealed to actually be a passing train, giving the audience the anxiety that this was going to be a major turning point. Along with the natural sounds kept in the film, Steven Spielberg also incorporated a minimal score, composed by Billy Goldenberg.\n\n===Music===\nThe film's original score was composed by [[Billy Goldenberg]], who had previously written the music for Spielberg's segment of the ''Night Gallery'' pilot and his ''[[Columbo]]'' episode \"Murder by the Book,\" and co-scored Spielberg's ''The Name of the Game'' episode \"L.A. 2017\" with [[Robert Prince (composer)|Robert Prince]]. Spielberg and ''Duel'' producer [[George Eckstein]] told him that because of the short production schedule, he would have to write the music during filming, and Goldenberg visited the production on location at [[Soledad Canyon]] to help get an idea of what would be required. Spielberg then had Goldenberg ride in the tanker truck being driven by stunt driver Carey Loftin on several occasions; the experience terrified the composer, although he did eventually get used to it. Goldenberg then composed the score in about a week, for strings, harp, keyboards and heavy use of percussion instruments, with Moog synthesiser effects but eschewing brass and woodwinds. He then worked with the music editors to \"pick from all the pieces (they) had and cut it together (with the sound effects and dialogue).\" Much of his score was ultimately not used in the finished film.<ref>Jon Burlingame, pp. 297-298, ''TV's Biggest Hits: The Story Of Television Themes From \"[[Dragnet (1951 TV series)|Dragnet]]\" To \"[[Friends]]\"'', Schirmer Books, 1996, {{ISBN|0-02-870324-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intrada.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=6594|title=Intrada Soundtrack Forum \u2022 View topic - INTRADA Announces Billy Goldenberg's DUEL|publisher=}}</ref> In 2015 [[Intrada Records]] released a limited edition album featuring the complete score, plus four radio source music tracks composed by Goldenberg.\n\n==Release==\n''Duel'' was initially shown on American television as an ''[[ABC Movie of the Week]]'' installment.
