With their parents going out for the night, Fly and Stella are babysat by their Aunt Anna and her son Chuck, a cautious, overweight genetics prodigy. When Anna falls asleep, the children sneak out to go [[fishing]]. Caught in a high tide, they stumble across the [[boathouse]] of Professor MacKrill, an eccentric [[marine biologist]]. Reasoning that [[climate change]] will melt the [[polar icecap]]s within the next century, MacKrill developed a potion to [[shapeshifting|transform]] humans into fish, along with an antidote to reverse the process.\n\nStella drinks the potion, turning into a [[starfish]], which Fly unknowingly throws out the boat into the sea. Chuck discovers the mistake after Stella\u2019s transformation was caught on camera. The trio set out to find Stella, but their boat sinks in a storm. Fly and Chuck drink the potion, becoming a [[California flyingfish]] and a [[jellyfish]]. MacKrill survives, returning to his boathouse. Lisa, Bill, and Anna become aware of the children\u2019s disappearance, locate MacKrill, learning what has happened.\n\nUnderwater, the leaking antidote attracts a [[great white shark]] and a [[pilot fish]]. They consume it, gaining intelligence and anthropomorphic appearances. Joe, the pilot fish, quickly uses the antidote to found a civilization of intelligent fish, intending to launch a revolution. The Shark becomes his dim-witted subordinate.\n\nFly, Chuck, and Stella reunite, accompanied by Sasha, a [[seahorse]] who Stella adopts. If they do not find the antidote within forty-eight hours, their transformations will be irreversible. The trio swim to Joe\u2019s domain, a sunken [[oil tanker]], where Fly tries to steal the antidote. They are caught, Joe interrogating them about their intent and origins. He demands they manufacture more of the antidote, or the Shark will eat them. The children are imprisoned, guarded by an aggressive, militaristic [[crab]]. Sasha frees the children, who manage to escape.\n\nThe children decide their best hope is to duplicate the antidote\u2019s formula themselves, gathering ingredients from around the ocean. Just as they complete the potion, Joe and his army appear. In a stand off, Joe drinks the last of the original antidote. The children try to flee, but Fly is wounded by the Crab, who drinks the new antidote, declaring himself the King Crab. At the same time, MacKrill and Bill pass over in a makeshift boat powered by a [[water pump]]. The pump causes an underwater typhoon, sucking up all of the army. The Shark eats the King Crab, but is incapacitated by the pump.\n\nChuck remembers that MacKrill has another antidote in his laboratory. Formulating a plan, Chuck plans to carry Fly and Stella through dangerous seawater intake pipes back to the lab. Stella has to leave Sasha behind. The children flood MacKrill\u2019s laboratory to reach the potion, but Joe follows, stealing it. Fly pursues Joe into the pipe, tricking him into repeatedly drinking from the potion by challenging his intellect. Joe evolves into a deformed humanoid and drowns.\n\nFly drags the antidote back into the lab, Chuck uncorking it just as Lisa and Anna open the door to the flooded lab. Chuck and Stella become human once more, reuniting with their parents and MacKrill. After a few tense moments in which a stuffed fish is mistaken for the limp body of Fly, the human Fly emerges from one of the lab's pipes with a broken leg.\n\nSome time afterward, the family and MacKrill play on the beach. Sasha appears, so Chuck and MacKrill transform her into an actual [[horse]], who Stella rides around with joy.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Character !! Danish voice actor !!

It stars the voices of [[Alan Rickman]], [[Terry Jones]] and a then-unknown [[Aaron Paul]].\n\nIt was released on 6 October 2000 in [[Denmark]], 10 August 2001 in United Kingdom, and 5 September 2006 in the United States. Danish teen-pop girl-group [[Little Trees (band)|Little Trees]] performed the title track, \"[[Help! I'm a Fish (Little Yellow Fish)]]\", which was released as a single in the UK. Fellow Danish girl group [[Creamy]] also recorded a version of the song. The [[Belgian]] girl group [[K3 (band)|K3]] also recorded a [[Dutch language|Dutch]] version of the song for the movie.

With their parents going out for the night, Fly and Stella are babysat by their Aunt Anna and her son Chuck, a cautious, overweight genetics prodigy. When Anna falls asleep, the children sneak out to go [[fishing]]. Caught in a high tide, they stumble across the [[boathouse]] of Professor MacKrill, an eccentric [[marine biologist]]. Reasoning that [[climate change]] will melt the [[polar icecap]]s within the next century, MacKrill developed a potion to [[shapeshifting|transform]] humans into fish, along with an antidote to reverse the process.\n\nStella drinks the potion, turning into a [[starfish]], which Fly unknowingly throws out the boat into the sea. Chuck discovers the mistake after Stella\u2019s transformation was caught on camera. The trio set out to find Stella, but their boat sinks in a storm. Fly and Chuck drink the potion, becoming a [[California flyingfish]] and a [[jellyfish]]. MacKrill survives, returning to his boathouse. Lisa, Bill, and Anna become aware of the children\u2019s disappearance, locate MacKrill, learning what has happened.\n\nUnderwater, the leaking antidote attracts a [[great white shark]] and a [[pilot fish]]. They consume it, gaining intelligence and anthropomorphic appearances. Joe, the pilot fish, quickly uses the antidote to found a civilization of intelligent fish, intending to launch a revolution. The Shark becomes his dim-witted subordinate.\n\nFly, Chuck, and Stella reunite, accompanied by Sasha, a [[seahorse]] who Stella adopts. If they do not find the antidote within forty-eight hours, their transformations will be irreversible. The trio swim to Joe\u2019s domain, a sunken [[oil tanker]], where Fly tries to steal the antidote. They are caught, Joe interrogating them about their intent and origins. He demands they manufacture more of the antidote, or the Shark will eat them. The children are imprisoned, guarded by an aggressive, militaristic [[crab]]. Sasha frees the children, who manage to escape.\n\nThe children decide their best hope is to duplicate the antidote\u2019s formula themselves, gathering ingredients from around the ocean. Just as they complete the potion, Joe and his army appear. In a stand off, Joe drinks the last of the original antidote. The children try to flee, but Fly is wounded by the Crab, who drinks the new antidote, declaring himself the King Crab. At the same time, MacKrill and Bill pass over in a makeshift boat powered by a [[water pump]]. The pump causes an underwater typhoon, sucking up all of the army. The Shark eats the King Crab, but is incapacitated by the pump.\n\nChuck remembers that MacKrill has another antidote in his laboratory. Formulating a plan, Chuck plans to carry Fly and Stella through dangerous seawater intake pipes back to the lab. Stella has to leave Sasha behind. The children flood MacKrill\u2019s laboratory to reach the potion, but Joe follows, stealing it. Fly pursues Joe into the pipe, tricking him into repeatedly drinking from the potion by challenging his intellect. Joe evolves into a deformed humanoid and drowns.\n\nFly drags the antidote back into the lab, Chuck uncorking it just as Lisa and Anna open the door to the flooded lab. Chuck and Stella become human once more, reuniting with their parents and MacKrill. After a few tense moments in which a stuffed fish is mistaken for the limp body of Fly, the human Fly emerges from one of the lab's pipes with a broken leg.\n\nSome time afterward, the family and MacKrill play on the beach. Sasha appears, so Chuck and MacKrill transform into an actual [[horse]], who Stella rides around with joy.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Character !! Danish voice actor !!

I'm a Fish'' also known as ''A Fish Tale''. Karsten Kiilerich, John Stefan Olsen and Tracy J. Brown wrote the script for the film. Anders Mastrup and Phil Nibbelink produced the film for release in 2000. On 9 March 1998 it was announced that Jeff Pace, Sebastian Jessen, Michelle Westerson, Pil Neja, [[Alessandro Juliani]], [[Aaron Paul]], Morten Kernn Nielsen, [[Terry Jones]], [[S\u00f8ren S\u00e6tter-Lassen]], [[Alan Rickman]], Nis Bank-Mikkelsen, [[David Bateson]], [[Dick Kays\u00f8]], [[Louise Fribo]], [[Ulf Pilgaard]], [[John Payne (voice actor)|John Payne]], [[Peter Gantzler]], [[Teryl Rothery]], [[Paprika Steen]], [[Pauline Newstone]], [[Ghita N\u00f8rby]], [[Richard Newman (actor)|Richard Newman]] and [[Zlatko Buric]] joined the film. On April 12, 1999, it was announced that [[S\u00f8ren Hyldgaard]] would compose the music for the film. In 1996, a pilot trailer was completed, which has resurfaced on the Internet. The environment and object designs, animation, plot, and the character names, voices and designs are noticeably different from how they would eventually appear in the finished film.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACMPuu7_B5E | work = YouTube | title = A fish tale pilot trailer (1996) | accessdate = 1 October 2017 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180714215828/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACMPuu7_B5E | archivedate = 14 July 2018 }}</ref>\n\nDevelopment and storyboarding of the film was completed in Denmark. Production then moved to Germany and Ireland for the final phases of animation, lighting, color and production in order to maximize tax credits offered to foreign film projects in Germany and Ireland.

{"title_page": "Tellurium", "text_new": "{{for|the astronomical device|tellurion}}\n{{short description|chemical element with atomic number 52}}\n{{infobox tellurium}}\n'''Tellurium''' is a [[chemical element]] with the [[Symbol (chemistry)|symbol]]&nbsp;'''Te''' and [[atomic number]]&nbsp;52. It is a brittle, mildly toxic, rare, silver-white [[metalloid]]. Tellurium is chemically related to [[selenium]] and [[sulfur]], all three of which are [[chalcogen]]s. It is occasionally found in native form as elemental crystals. Tellurium is far more common in the Universe as a whole than on Earth. Its extreme [[abundance of the chemical elements|rarity]] in the Earth's crust, comparable to that of [[platinum]], is due partly to its formation of a volatile [[hydride]] that caused tellurium to be lost to space as a gas during the hot nebular formation of Earth,<ref name=\"Chemical\">Anderson, Don L.; \"Chemical Composition of the Mantle\" in ''Theory of the Earth'', pp. 147-175 {{ISBN|0865421234}}</ref> and partly to tellurium's low affinity for oxygen, which causes it to bind preferentially to other chalcophiles in dense minerals that sink into the core.\n\n[[Telluride mineral|Tellurium-bearing compounds]] were first discovered in 1782 in a gold mine in [[Zlatna|Kleinschlatten]], [[Transylvania]] (now Zlatna, [[Romania]]) by [[Austrians|Austrian]] [[Mineralogy|mineralogist]] [[Franz-Joseph M\u00fcller von Reichenstein]], although it was [[Martin Heinrich Klaproth]] who named the new element in 1798 after the Latin word for \"earth\", ''tellus''. [[Gold telluride]] minerals are the most notable natural gold compounds. However, they are not a commercially significant source of tellurium itself, which is normally extracted as a by-product of [[copper]] and [[lead]] production.\n\nCommercially, the primary use of tellurium is copper ([[tellurium copper]]) and steel [[alloy]]s, where it improves [[machinability]]. Applications in [[CdTe solar panel]]s and [[cadmium telluride]] semiconductors also consume a considerable portion of tellurium production.

Tellurium is more abundant than [[rubidium]] in the cosmos, though rubidium is 10,000 times more abundant in the Earth's crust. The rarity of tellurium on Earth is thought to be caused by conditions during preaccretional sorting in the solar nebula, when the stable form of certain elements, in the absence of [[oxygen]] and [[water]], was controlled by the reductive power of free [[hydrogen]]. Under this scenario, certain elements that form volatile [[hydride]]s, such as tellurium, were severely depleted through evaporation of these hydrides. Tellurium and selenium are the heavy elements most depleted by this process.<ref name=\"Chemical\"/>\n\nTellurium is sometimes found in its native (i.e., elemental) form, but is more often found as the tellurides of [[gold]] such as [[calaverite]] and [[krennerite]] (two different [[polymorphism (materials science)|polymorph]]s of AuTe<sub>2</sub>), [[petzite]], Ag<sub>3</sub>AuTe<sub>2</sub>, and [[sylvanite]], AgAuTe<sub>4</sub>. The city of [[Telluride, Colorado]], was named in hope of a strike of gold telluride (which never materialized, though gold metal ore was found). Gold itself is usually found uncombined, but when found as a chemical compound, it is most often combined with tellurium.\n\nAlthough tellurium is found with gold more often than in uncombined form, it is found even more often combined as tellurides of more common metals (e.g. [[melonite]], NiTe<sub>2</sub>). Natural [[tellurite]] and [[tellurate]] minerals also occur, formed by oxidation of tellurides near the Earth's surface. In contrast to selenium, tellurium does not usually replace sulfur in minerals because of the great difference in ion radii. Thus, many common sulfide minerals contain substantial quantities of selenium and only traces of tellurium.<ref>{{Cite book|chapter = Phase Relations in the Selenide Telluride Systems|pages =217\u2013256| isbn = 978-90-5410-723-1|chapter-url =https://books.google.com/books?id=HUWRZecignoC&pg=PA217|publisher = Taylor & Francis|date = 1996|title = Geochemistry, mineralogy and genesis of gold deposits|first = I.

It is a brittle, mildly toxic, rare, silver-white [[metalloid]]. Tellurium is chemically related to [[selenium]] and [[sulfur]], all three of which are [[chalcogen]]s. It is occasionally found in native form as elemental crystals. Tellurium is far more common in the Universe as a whole than on Earth. Its extreme [[abundance of the chemical elements|rarity]] in the Earth's crust, comparable to that of [[platinum]], is due partly to its formation of a volatile [[hydride]] that caused tellurium to be lost to space as a gas during the hot nebular formation of Earth,<ref name=\"Chemical\">Anderson, Don L.; \"Chemical Composition of the Mantle\" in ''Theory of the Earth'', pp. 147-175 {{ISBN|0865421234}}</ref> and partly to tellurium's low affinity for oxygen, which causes it to bind preferentially to other chalcophiles in dense minerals that sink into the core.\n\n[[Telluride mineral|Tellurium-bearing compounds]] were first discovered in 1782 in a gold mine in [[Zlatna|Kleinschlatten]], [[Transylvania]] (now Zlatna, [[Romania]]) by [[Austrians|Austrian]] [[Mineralogy|mineralogist]] [[Franz-Joseph M\u00fcller von Reichenstein]], although it was [[Martin Heinrich Klaproth]] who named the new element in 1798 after the Latin word for \"earth\", ''tellus''. [[Gold telluride]] minerals are the most notable natural gold compounds. However, they are not a commercially significant source of tellurium itself, which is normally extracted as a by-product of [[copper]] and [[lead]] production.\n\nCommercially, the primary use of tellurium is copper ([[tellurium copper]]) and steel [[alloy]]s, where it improves [[machinability]]. Applications in [[CdTe solar panel]]s and [[cadmium telluride]] semiconductors also consume a considerable portion of tellurium production. Tellurium is considered a [[technology-critical element]].\n\nTellurium has no biological function, although fungi can use it in place of sulfur and selenium in [[amino acid]]s such as [[cysteine|tellurocysteine]] and [[methionine|telluromethionine]].<ref name=\"tellurium-fungi\" /> In humans, tellurium is partly metabolized into [[dimethyl telluride]], (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Te, a gas with a [[garlic]]-like odor exhaled in the breath of victims of tellurium exposure or poisoning.\n\n==Characteristics==\n\n===Physical properties===\nTellurium has two [[allotrope]]s, crystalline and amorphous. When [[crystal]]line, tellurium is silvery-white with a metallic luster. It is a brittle and easily pulverized metalloid.

Tellurium is more abundant than [[rubidium]] in the cosmos, though rubidium is 10,000 times more abundant in the Earth's crust. The rarity of tellurium on Earth is thought to be caused by conditions during preaccretional sorting in the solar nebula, when the stable form of certain elements, in the absence of [[oxygen]] and [[water]], was controlled by the reductive power of free [[hydrogen]]. Under this scenario, certain elements that form volatile [[hydride]]s, such as tellurium, were severely depleted through evaporation of these hydrides. Tellurium and selenium are the heavy elements most depleted by this process.<ref name=\"Chemical\"/>\n\nTellurium is sometimes found in its native (i.e., elemental) form, but is more often found as the tellurides of [[gold]] such as [[calaverite]] and [[krennerite]] (two different [[polymorphism (materials science)|polymorph]]s of AuTe<sub>2</sub>), [[petzite]], Ag<sub>3</sub>AuTe<sub>2</sub>, and [[sylvanite]], AgAuTe<sub>4</sub>. The city of [[Telluride, Colorado]], was named in hope of a strike of gold telluride (which never materialized, though gold metal ore was found). Gold itself is usually found uncombined, but when found as a chemical compound, it is most often combined with tellurium.\n\nAlthough tellurium is found with gold more often than in uncombined form, it is found even more often combined as tellurides of more common metals (e.g. [[melonite]], NiTe<sub>2</sub>). Natural [[tellurite]] and [[tellurate]] minerals also occur, formed by oxidation of tellurides near the Earth's surface. In contrast to selenium, tellurium does not usually replace sulfur in minerals because of the great difference in ion radii. Thus, many common sulfide minerals contain substantial quantities of selenium and only traces of tellurium.<ref>{{Cite book|chapter = Phase Relations in the Selenide Telluride Systems|pages =217\u2013256| isbn = 978-90-5410-723-1|chapter-url =https://books.google.com/books?id=HUWRZecignoC&pg=PA217|publisher = Taylor & Francis|date = 1996|title = Geochemistry, mineralogy and genesis of gold deposits|first = I.

As an anonymous reviewer in the [[Melbourne]] newspaper ''[[The Age]]'' put it in 1957, Redcap's adventures make \"a peg on which to hang the stories the people used to hear in the market places and inns 600 years ago....

Writing in the Puffin fan magazine ''Junior Bookshelf'' for 1952\u20131953, Graham wrote, \"I have only praise and the highest praise\" for the book, which \"stands head and shoulders above its contemporaries.\" It was \"a story which, if I am not mistaken, will set a new standard for us in children's stories.\"\n\nThe delineation of the characters and plot drew upon Rhoda's experience in schools' broadcasting, in which her forte was the dramatization of history for younger listeners. Her grasp of the social history of medieval England owes much to her older sister, the historian Eileen Power, who before her early death in 1940 had collaborated with Rhoda in preparing scripts for broadcasting on the BBC. Among these had been a story about life in a medieval village, told from the standpoint of Simon, a serf who had fled from a nearby manor. This story may have suggested the framework for ''Redcap Runs Away''.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} However, English literary concern with minstrelsy has been continual since the [[Romanticism|Romantic period]]: poems such as Sir [[Walter Scott]]'s ''[[The Lay of the Last Minstrel]]'' (1805) and [[John Clare]]'s ''The Village Minstrel'' (1821), and novels like [[Helen Craik]]'s ''Henry of Northumberland'' (1800), [[Sydney Owenson]]'s ''The Novice of St. Dominick'' (a girl flees disguised as a minstrel, 1805), and more recently, [[Christabel Rose Coleridge]]'s ''Minstrel Dick'' (a boy minstrel becomes a courtier, 1891) and [[Howard Spring]]'s ''Darkie and Co.'' (a boy runs away from an unhappy home to join a travelling show, 1932).\n\nThe inclusion of so many minstrel stories in ''Redcap'' adds to the book's authenticity, but not all US critics at the time viewed this favourably. Commenting on the 1954 US edition, ''The Bulletin of the Children's Book Center'' wrote that \"because of the many stories which have been included (one to each chapter) the plot moves slowly, and reading is further hampered by the extremely poor format, with its small type, crowded lines, and poor paper.\"<ref>Vol. VII/10, June 1954, p. 89.

Rhoda Power attended [[Oxford High School (Oxford)|Oxford High School]], run by the [[Girls' Day School Trust|Girls' Public Day School Trust]], and then read modern languages, economics and political economy at [[St. Andrews University]] in Scotland (1911\u20131913).<ref name=\"Girton\" >Girton College Archive, Cambridge, UK, Personal Papers of Rhoda Power, GCPP Power, R.

In 1917, she became governess to the daughter of a business family in [[Rostov-on-Don]], Russia, where she became caught up in the [[October Revolution]]. An illness she caught there may have triggered the progressive deafness from which she began to suffer.\n\nPower started to write history books for children in the 1920s, with her sister Eileen and later independently.

After the merger was completed in January 2019, the City received a 4.63 per cent stake in Alectra and a one-time dividend of $18.5 million; afterwards, annual dividends would be received. The city has one permanent seat on the company's Board.<ref>{{cite web|title=Guelph Hydro, Alectra merger approved|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/4808710/guelph-hydro-alectra-utilities-merger/|date=2 January 2019|work=Global News|access-date=22 February 2019|language=en-CA|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190223020906/https://globalnews.ca/news/4808710/guelph-hydro-alectra-utilities-merger/|archive-date=February 23, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Topography and water courses===\nDowntown Guelph is situated above the confluence of the [[Speed River]] and the [[Eramosa River]], which have numerous tributaries. The Speed River enters from the north and the Eramosa River from the east; the two rivers meet below downtown and continue southwest, where they merge with the [[Grand River (Ontario)]]. There are also many creeks and smaller rivers creating large tracts of densely forested ravines, and providing ideal sites for parks and recreational trails. The city is built on several [[drumlin]]s and buried waterways, the most notable being an underground creek flowing below the Albion Hotel, once the source of water used to brew beer.\n\n===Climate===\n\nThis region of Ontario has cold winters and warm, humid summers, falling into the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] '''Dfb''' zone, with moderately high rainfall and snowfall. It is generally a couple of degrees cooler than lower elevation regions on the [[Great Lakes|Great Lake]]s shorelines, especially so in winter, the exception being on some spring afternoons when the lack of an onshore breeze boosts temperatures well above those found lakeside.\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Guelph was {{convert|38.3|C|1}} on 6 August 1918 and 13 July 1936.<ref name=\"August 1918\"/><ref name=\"July 1936\"/> The coldest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|-37.2|C|1}} on 25 January 1884.<ref name=\"January 1884\"/>\n\n{{Weather box\n| location     =

The Speed River enters from the north and the Eramosa River from the east; the two rivers meet below downtown and continue southwest, where they merge with the [[Grand River (Ontario)]]. There are also many creeks and smaller rivers creating large tracts of densely forested ravines, and providing ideal sites for parks and recreational trails. The city is built on several [[drumlin]]s and buried waterways, the most notable being an underground creek flowing below the Albion Hotel, once the source of water used to brew beer.\n\n===Climate===\n\nThis region of Ontario has cold winters and warm, humid summers, falling into the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] '''Dfb''' zone, with moderately high rainfall and snowfall. It is generally a couple of degrees cooler than lower elevation regions on the [[Great Lakes|Great Lake]]s shorelines, especially so in winter, the exception being on some spring afternoons when the lack of an onshore breeze boosts temperatures well above those found lakeside.\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Guelph was {{convert|38.3|C|1}} on 6 August 1918 and 13 July 1936.<ref

During [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]], Christians considered [[Christian heresy|heresy]] and [[Dissenter|dissent]] punishable offenses. However, [[Early modern Europe]] witnessed the turning point in the '''history of Christian thought on persecution and tolerance'''. Christian writers like [[John Milton]] and [[John Locke]] argued for limited religious toleration, while some Christians eventually came to support the concept of [[Freedom of religion|religious freedom]] which was developed by deists like [[Thomas Jefferson]]. Contemporary Christians generally agree that heresy and dissent are not punishable offenses.<ref name=\"Coffey00-206\">Coffey 2000: 206.</ref>\n\n==Historical background ==\n====Early Christianity====\n\n[[Early Christianity]] was a minority religion in the [[Roman Empire]] and [[Persecution of early Christians by the Romans|the early Christians were persecuted, on and off, during their first 300 years]]. Christianity's definition and practice of tolerance/intolerance were influenced by that persecution in a largely negative way. However, according to Guy Stroumsa, there is still a history in early Christian thought of tolerance as a concept, though not a fully developed one, and with some ambivalence, presenting both inclusivity and inventing the concept of heresy in Christian thought.<ref name=\"Stroumsa\">{{cite book|last=Stroumsa|first=Guy|editor1=Graham N.Stanton|editor2=Guy G.

At the same time a Germanic tribe, the Lombards, were gaining in Italy, another Germanic  tribe, the Franks were establishing their rule in what had been Roman Gaul and would become modern France. Clovis the first, a convert to Latin Christianity, became the first important ruler of  the Merovingian dynasty. He supported missionaries in newly conquered territories and strengthened ties with the Pope. After 700, the Merovongians gradually lost control of the kingdom to the Carolingians.  In 754, the Pope traveled to St.Denis, near Paris, to crown Pepin the Short king and name him defender of the faith. In exchange, Pepin crushed the Lombards and gave their land to the Pope. This alliance suited both parties, and redirected the church's interest away from the East, linking Rome's destiny with the West.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|198\u2013199}}\n\nConstantine used forced conversion and his Bishop Alcuin wrote him a rebuke against it.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|200\u2013201}}\n\nThe crusades evidence a dramatic shift in Christian thought on tolerance and persecution.\n\n====High Middle Ages====\n\nFeudalism declined and persecution changed during the High Middle Ages as kings began centralizing power into themselves and the state.  Under feudalism, a noble Lord gave military support to his king, but when so many nobles sold or leased their land and left for the East on crusade, kings began building armies of mercenaries for themselves and taking over legal processes that had traditionally been local. This process led to the development of persecution of minorities between the tenth to the thirteenth centuries in Europe.<ref name =\"Moore\">{{cite book|last=Moore|first=R. I.|title=The Formation of a Persecuting Society|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden, Massachusetts| edition=second|year=2007|isbn=978-1-4051-2964-0}}</ref> Concepts of heresy firmed up in Christian thought alongside concepts of orthodoxy.  Inquisitions were formed. The church began passing the punishment of heretics to the civil authorities who practiced corporal punishments and death.\n\nAlso during the high Middle Ages, 1000\u20131250, the [[Crusades]] continued to pitch Christians and Muslims against each other in wars lasting into the late middle ages with massacres and atrocities on both sides.\n\n====Late Middle Ages====\nAfter the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and the later [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsardom]] had conquered the [[Kazan Khanate|Kazan]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate]]s in the 1550s, the [[History of Tatarstan|government forcibly baptized]] Muslim [[Volga Tatars]] and pagan [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], [[Mordva]] and [[Mari people|Mari]]. Mosques were banned. This persecution only ended during the reign of [[Catherine II of Russia]] in the late eighteenth century.\n\nThe [[Northern Crusades]], a series of campaigns against the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of northeastern Europe, faced fierce pagan resistance, requiring decades of violence by dedicated [[Teutonic Order|warrior-monks]] to force the submission, and compel the conversion, of the region's inhabitants, who were often left as serfs to an imported Christian [[Baltic Germans|German-speaking nobility]].<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15.</ref> There were often severe consequences for populations that chose to resist; for example, the Christian conquest and conversion of Old Prussia resulted in the death of much of the native population, whose [[Old Prussian|language]] subsequently became extinct.<ref name=\"The German Hansa page 34\">The German Hansa, P. Dollinger, page 34, 1999, Routledge</ref>\n  \nThe [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]]s also went on to persecute Jews and Muslims. In Spain after the [[Reconquista]], Jews were forced to either convert or be exiled. Many were killed. The persecution of Jews goes back to 12th-century Spain after the emergence of the [[blood libel against Jews]]. Although the Spanish had agreed to grant Muslims the right to freely practice their religion in 1492, this promise was frequently broken. In 1501, Muslims were offered the choice of conversion or exile. In 1556, Arab or Muslim dress was forbidden, and in 1566 the Arabic language as a whole was prohibited in Spain.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lapidus | first =  Ira M. | title = A History of Islamic societes | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1988 | isbn = 0-521-22552-3| page = 389}}</ref> Jews were eventually expelled from England by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], too.\n\n====Reformation Era====\n\nWhen [[Martin Luther]] wrote his [[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]] in 1517, Catholicism reacted the same way as it had to the heresies of the late Middle Ages. However, while the [[Protestant Reformation]] could be \"crushed\" in Spain with \"a few dozen executions in the 1550s\",<ref>Coffey 2000: 212</ref> the same strategy failed in Germany, Northern Europe and in England. France had to suffer through the [[French Wars of Religion]] before it again became wholly Catholic. The divide between [[Catholicism]] and  the new [[Protestantism|Protestant denominations]] was deep. Protestants commonly alleged that the catholic [[Pope]] was the [[Antichrist]]. Conflicts between Christian factions reached their heights in France with the 1572 [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], in Germany and [[Central Europe]] with the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) and in England with the [[English Civil War]] (1641\u20131651). Following the devastations caused by these wars, the ideas of [[religious toleration]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[religious pluralism]] slowly gained ground in Europe. The [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe]], which had reached their height between 1550 and 1650, continued until 1750.\n\n====Early Modern Era====\n\nEuropean [[Colonialism]], that was accompanied by Christian evangelism and often by violence, led to the suppression of [[Folk religion|indigenous religions]] in the territories conquered or usurped by the Europeans. The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] largely destroyed the [[Aztec]] and [[Inca civilization]]. However, Colonialism (and later European [[Imperialism]]) as a whole were not motivated by religious zeal; the suppression of the indigenous religions was their side result, not their main purpose. Only partial aspects, like the [[Goa Inquisition]], bear resemblance to the persecutions that occurred on the European continent. By the 18th century, persecutions of unsanctioned beliefs had been reduced in most Europeans countries to [[religious discrimination]], in the form of legal restrictions on those who did not accept the official faith. This often included being barred from higher education, or from participation in the national legislature. In colonized nations, attempts to convert native peoples to Christianity became more encouraging and less forceful. In British India during the Victorian era, Christian converts were given preferential treatment for governmental appointments.\n\n====Modern Era====\nAt the present time, most countries in which Christianity is the religion of the majority of the people, are either [[secular state]]s or they embrace the [[separation of Church and State]] in another way. (A list of countries in which Christianity is still the state religion can be found in the article on [[State religion]].)

Charlemagne was king. As king, he advocated Christian principles, had at least one Christian advisor, and openly supported Christian missions. The Franks had been fighting the Saxons since  Charlemagne's grandfather, with Charlemagne himself beginning in earnest in 772, taking years to finally defeat them.  They made treaties.  The events of 782 began when Widukind, the Saxon leader, persuaded a group of Saxons who had submitted to Charlemagne, to break their treaty and rebel. Charlemagne was elsewhere, so they went to battle with the Frankish army that had been left behind and annihilated it.  They killed two of the King\u2019s chief lieutenants, and some of his closest companions and counsellors. Charlemagne gathered his forces, returned to Saxony, conquered the Saxon rebels, giving them the option of convert or die. The Saxons largely refused, and though no one knows the number for sure, it is said 4500 unarmed prisoners were murdered in what is called the \"[[Massacre of Verden]].\" Massive deportations followed, and death was decreed as the penalty for any Saxon who refused baptism thereafter.<ref name =\"Logan\">{{cite book|last=Logan|first=F.

Clouse:<ref name=\"Clouse\"/>{{rp|18}}<blockquote>It is clear from the crusades that what finally overpowered the early Christian teaching against violence was not merely a just war theory but rather a merger of violence and holiness at all levels of Christian life. ... The liturgy was expanded to include the blessing of weapons and standards. Knights were consecrated by ceremonies which were often a revival of old pagan customs.  There were new militant religious orders established such as the Templars who promised to fight the enemies of God in addition to taking the normal vows of poverty, chastity and obedience.  When violence became sacred, the enemy was believed to be diabolical.  Thus the Turks were looked upon as opponents of the kingdom of God, a fulfillment of the forces of the antichrist as predicted in the book of Revelation.</blockquote>\n\nThis view of holiness and violence as merged in Christian thought is supported in Riley-Smith who says the crusades were products of the renewed spirituality of the central Middle Ages, with its concern for living the [[Vita apostolica|''vita apostolica'']] and expressing Christian ideals in active works of charity, exemplified by the new hospitals, the pastoral work of the Augustinians and Premonstratensians, and the service of the friars.

The king was a monarch in distress. He had little control of his fractious nobles in the north, and had absolutely no control over the southern nobles.<ref name=\"Moore2\"/>  He needed a way to channel the aggressive nature in the north and establish dominance in the South. All the men who marched from town to town, burning, killing, raping and looting, were from northern France.  And, under law in the Middle Ages, the lands of defeated barons could be legally confiscated. Moore says the Pope supplied an excuse for something the king wanted anyway.

The mercenaries quickly took advantage of the chaos and followed their retreat, storming the walls of the city that were not yet properly manned. The walls were easily taken, and the mercenaries entered the gate, seemingly without orders from their leaders. The crusader knights, soon realizing that the defenses had been broken, joined the mercenaries in battle, easily overwhelming the town garrison. The mercenaries began  rampaging through the streets, killing and plundering, while those citizens who could run, sought refuge in the churches and cathedrals, but there was no safety from the raging mob of mercenaries.

It included the Episcopal Inquisition (1184\u20131230s) which began when Pope Lucius the third issued a decree through the papal bull ''Ad abolendam,'' and the Papal Inquisition, which started in the 1230s. Canon law was still developing at this time, and it was based on Roman law to such a degree that it can be said the church reintroduced Roman law in Europe in the form of the Inquisition when it seemed that Germanic law had failed.<ref name=\"Monter\">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Inquisition, The: The Inquisition In The Old World|author=William Monter|date=April 7, 2020|publisher=Encyclopedia.com| url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/environment/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/inquisition-inquisition-old-world}}</ref>  In the Late Roman Empire, an inquisitorial system of justice had developed that allowed magistrates to investigate crimes in the absence of formal charges. The roles of evidence collector, prosecutor, and judge were combined in the inquisitor.  This inquisitorial process was in place when the Roman Empire converted to Christianity in the fourth century and it is the system that was revived in the middle ages. As a result, in his decretal of 1199, ''Vergentis in senium'', [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]] (1198\u20131216), took the crucial step of combining heresy with the Roman-law doctrine of ''l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9'', thereby accusing heretics of treason against God.<ref name=\"Monter\"/>\n\nThe cultural and religious process of centralizing power included the development, between the tenth to the thirteenth centuries, of a new kind of persecution aimed at minorities who provided much of the fodder for inquisition.<ref name =\"Moore\"/>  For example, Peter Comestor (d.1197) was the first influential scholar to interpret biblical injunctions against sodomy as referring specifically to homosexual intercourse. The Third Lateran council of 1179 then became the first to legislate on it as deserving of being deprived of office or excommunicated.<ref name=\"Moore\"/>{{rp|87}} The Fourth Lateran council reduced those penalties, but later Gregory IX ordered the Dominicans to extirpate homosexuality from Germany.  A series of legal codes were thereafter promulgated from the 1250s on in Spain, France, Italy and Germany. By 1300, places where sodomy was not a capitol offense had become the exception rather than the rule.<ref name=\"Moore\"/>{{rp|87}}\n\nThe historian Robert Moore says most complex traditional societies, including those in early and medieval Europe, have always contained some kind of persecution that occurred and subsided and occurred again, but that twelfth century Europe's persecution was more serious because it was characterized by the demonization of the accused, a new attitude, and mechanisms such as new laws, and the inquisitions, a new method.<ref name=\"Moore\"/>{{rp|154}}\n\n===The Jews===\nIn the centuries after the fall of the Roman empire, Jews established small communities, engaged in commerce, and were seldom singled out as targets of verbal abuse or physical violence.<ref name=\"Berger\">{{cite book|last=Berger|first=D|title=New Perspectives on Jewish-Christian Relations: In Honor of David Berger| year=2012|publisher=Brill|location=Netherlands|isbn=978-9-00422-117-8}}</ref>{{rp|2}}  However, historians agree that the eleventh to the thirteenth century was a turning point in Jewish-Christian relations.<blockquote> \"[[Bernard of Clairvaux]], (1090-1153) pillar of European monasticism and powerful twelfth century preacher, provides a perfect example of a Christian thinker balancing on a precipice, preaching hateful images of Jews at the same time as he sounded Scripture based admonitions that they must be protected despite their nature.<ref name=\"Berger\"/>{{rp|2}}</blockquote> Low level theological repartee had long existed between Jews and Christians. These interchanges attest to neighborly relations as Jew and Christian both struggled to fit \"other\" into their sense of the demands of their faith, and balance the human opponents facing them with the traditions they inherited.<ref name=\"Berger\"/>{{rp|3}} By the thirteenth century that repartee had changed in both tone and quality, growing more polemical.<ref name=\"Berger\"/>{{rp|3-7}} \n\nIn 1215, the [[Fourth Lateran Council]], known as the Great Council, met and accepted 70 canons that reflect Christian thinking as both militant and victorious in tone.<ref name=\"Berger\"/>{{rp|58}} It hammered out a working definition of Christian community, and stated the essentials of membership in it, thereby defining \"other\" within Christian thought for the next three centuries.  The last three canons required Jews to distinguish themselves from Christians in their dress, prohibited them from holding public office, and prohibited Jewish converts from continuing to practice Jewish rituals.<ref name=\"Moore\"/>{{rp|7}} As Berger has articulated it: \"The other side of a coin of unique toleration was a unique persecution.\"<ref name=\"Berger\"/>{{rp|2}}.

As they learned how the central figures of Christianity were mocked, inquisitors went after the Talmud, and other Jewish writings.<ref name=\"Mundy\"/>{{rp|64}} The Fourth Lateran council, in its 68th canon, placed on the secular authorities the responsibility for obtaining an answer from the Jews to the charge of blasphemy. For the first time in history, Jews had to answer in public trial. There is no consensus in the sources as to who instigated the trial against the Talmud, but in June of 1239, [[Gregory IX]] (1237-1241) issued letters to various Archbishops and Kings across Europe to seize all Jewish books and take them to the Dominicans for examination.  The order was heeded only in Paris where, on June 25th, the Royal court was opened to hear the case. Eventually, each side claimed victory; a final verdict of guilt and condemnation was not announced until May of 1248, but the books had been burned six years before.<ref name=\"Rosenthal\">{{cite journal|last=Rosenthal|first= Judah M.|title=The Talmud on Trial: The Disputation at Paris in the Year 1240|journal= The Jewish Quarterly Review|volume= 47| issue= 1|year= 1956|pages=58\u201376|publisher= JSTOR|doi= 10.2307/1453186|jstor= 1453186}}</ref>{{rp|68-72}}  \n\nAs a result of this trial, the people of Europe thought that, even if they had once had an obligation to preserve the Jews for the sake of the Old Testament, Talmudic Judaism was so different from its biblical sources that the old obligation no longer applied.

They often filled the role of financial agent or manager for the Lords; they and their posessions were considered the property of the King in England; and they were often exempted from taxes and other laws because of the importance of their usury.  This attracted unpopularity, jealousy and resentment.<ref name=\"Moore\"/>{{rp|110}} As J. H.

The unique culture of the High middle ages with its union of the spiritual and the secular began to come apart. Rival European states at war with each other dimmed the church's dream of a united Christendom.  New military weapons and tactics rendered chivalry obsolete.  In the Universities, new intellectual currents moved away from Christian thought, and new secular voices began to be heard. <ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|243,248}}\n\nFrom its pinnacle of power in the 1200s, the church entered a period of decline, internal conflict, and corruption.  Devoted and virtuous nuns and monks become increasingly rare. Monastic reform had been a major force in the High Middle Ages but is largely unknown in the Late Middle ages. This led to the development of lay piety--the ''devotio moderna''--the new devotion, which worked toward the ideal of a pious society of ordinary non-ordained people.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|248-250}}\n\nLeaders who attempted to reform the church in England and Bohemia met strong resistance from the Popes. [[John Wycliffe]] (1320-1384) urged the church to give up ownership of property, which produced much of the church's wealth, and to once again embrace poverty and simplicity. He urged the church to stop being subservient to the state and its politics. He denied papal authority. John Wycliff died of a stroke, but his followers, called ''Lollards,'' were declared heretics.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|249}}  The first large scale attack on the Lollards came the year after the [[Peasant revolt]] of 1381.

These tactics were particularly widely used in the [[Northern Crusades]], where Christian rulers \u2013 and, later, monastic orders such as the [[Teutonic Knights]] \u2013 waged a centuries-long series of campaigns to compel the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of the region to convert by conquering them and settling in the newly conquered territory as feudal rulers.<ref>Christiansen, Eric.

Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1988. p.g. 157-158</ref> An example of how the use of forced conversion was justified, in the medieval Church, as compatible with previous Church doctrine on the subject can be found for instance in a statement made by [[Pope Innocent III]] in 1201 about those who agreed to be baptized to avoid torture and intimidation:\n\n<blockquote>[T]hose who are immersed even though reluctant, do belong to ecclesiastical jurisdiction at least by reason of the sacrament, and might therefore be reasonably compelled to observe the rules of the Christian Faith. It is, to be sure, contrary to the Christian Faith that anyone who is unwilling and wholly opposed to it should be compelled to adopt and observe Christianity. For this reason a valid distinction is made by some between kinds of unwilling ones and kinds of compelled ones. Thus one who is drawn to Christianity by violence, through fear and through torture, and receives the sacrament of Baptism in order to avoid loss, he (like one who comes to Baptism in dissimulation) does receive the impress of Christianity, and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling ...<ref>Chazan, Robert, ed., Church, State, and Jew in the Middle Ages, West Orange, NJ:Behrman House, 1980, p. 103.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn addition to sponsoring forced conversion, the Church accepted the use of forced conversion as a pretext for the elimination of hostile or recalcitrant tribes that did not easily submit to conquest.<ref>Fonnesberg-Schmidt, Iben. \u201cPope Honorius III and Mission and Crusades in the Baltic Region\u201d.

The Reformers \"fully embraced\" Augustine's advocacy of coercion in religious matters, and many regarded the death penalty for heresy as legitimate.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" />  Furthermore, by presenting a much more powerful threat to Catholic unity than the heretic groups of the Middle Ages, the Reformation led to the intensification of persecution under Catholic regimes.\n\n*[[Martin Luther]] had written against persecution in the 1520s, and had demonstrated genuine sympathy towards the Jews in his earlier writings, especially in ''Das Jesus ein geborener Jude sei'' (''That Jesus was born as a Jew'') from 1523,  but after 1525 his position hardened. In ''Wider die Sabbather an einen guten Freund'' (Against the Sabbather to a Good Friend), 1538, he still considered a conversion of the Jews to Christianity as possible,<ref>Thomas Kaufmann, 2005: ''Luthers \"Judenschriften in ihren historischen Kontexten'' (Nachrichten der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu G\u00f6ttingen) {{in lang|de}}, p. 526</ref> but in 1543 he published [[On the Jews and their Lies]], a \"violent anti-semitic tract.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 23, 24</ref>\n*[[John Calvin]] helped to secure the execution for heresy of [[Michael Servetus]],<ref>Coffey 2000: 24.</ref> although he unsuccessfully requested that he should be beheaded instead of being burned at the stake.\n\nEffectively, however, the 16th-century Protestant view was less extreme than the mediaeval Catholic position. In England, [[John Foxe]], [[John Hales]], [[Richard Perrinchief]], [[Herbert Thorndike]] and [[Jonas Proast]] all only saw mild forms of persecution against the [[English Dissenters]] as legitimate.<ref>see Coffey 2000: 24,25.</ref> But (with the probable exception of John Foxe), this was only a retraction in degree, not a full rejection of religious persecution.  There is also the crucial distinction between ''dissent'' and ''heresy'' to consider. Most dissenters disagreed with the Anglican Church only on secondary matters of worship and ecclesiology, and although this was a considered a serious sin, only a few 17th-century Anglican writers thought that this 'crime' deserved the death penalty.<ref name=\"Coffey00-25\">Coffey 2000: 25</ref> These concerns notwithstanding, the English government saw fit to execute as treasonous a multitude of priests, dissenters, and recusant Catholics, even those who retained but private reservations.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The English Act of Supremacy thus significantly complicated the matter by securely welding Church and state.\n\nThe Elizabethan bishop [[Thomas Bilson]] was of the opinion that men ought to be \"corrected, not murdered\",  but he did not condemn the Christian Emperors for executing the [[Manichaeans]] for \"monstrous blasphemies\".<ref>Coffey 2000: 24,26; Thomas Bilson 1585, ''The True Difference between Christian Subjection and Unchristian Rebellion'', pp. 19,20, 383.</ref> The Lutheran theologian [[Georgius Calixtus]] argued for the reconciliation of Christendom by removing all unimportant differences between Catholicism and Protestantism, and [[Rupertus Meldenius]] advocated [[in necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas]] (''in necessary things unity; in uncertain things freedom; in everything compassion'') in 1626.\n\n==Protestant advocacy of toleration==\n\n===The English Protestant 'Call for Toleration'===\nWhile the Christian theologians mentioned above advocated religious persecution to various extents, it was also Christians who helped pioneer the concept of [[religious toleration]].\n\nIn his book on 'The English Reformation', particularly in the chapter 'The Origins of Religious Toleration', the late [[A. G. Dickens]] argued that from the beginning of the Reformation there had \"existed in Protestant thought \u2013 in [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]] and [[Martin Bucer|Bucer]], as well as among the Anabaptists \u2013 a more liberal tradition, which [[John Frith]] was perhaps the first echo in England\".<ref>{{cite book |title= The English Reformation|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 438}};</ref> Condemned for heresy, Frith was burnt at the stake in 1533. In his own mind, he died not because of the denial of the doctrines on purgatory and transubstantiation but \"for the principle that a particular doctrine on either point was not a necessary part of a Christian's faith\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\">{{cite book |title= The English Reformation|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 116}};</ref> In other words, there was an important distinction to be made between a genuine article of faith and other matters where a variety of very different conclusions should be tolerated within the Church. This stand against unreasonable and profligate dogmatism meant that Frith, \"to a greater extent than any other of our early Protestants\", upheld \"a certain degree of religious freedom\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\"/>\n\nFrith was not alone. [[John Foxe]], for example, \"strove hard to save Anabaptists from the fire, and he enunciated a sweeping doctrine of tolerance even towards Catholics, whose doctrines he detested with every fibre of his being\".<ref>{{cite book |title= The English Reformation|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|pages= 439\u2013440}};</ref>\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Thomas Helwys]] was principal formulator of that distinctively [[Baptist]] request: that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law, so that individuals might have a freedom of religious conscience. Helwys said the King \"is a mortal man, and not God, therefore he hath no power over the mortal soul of his subjects to make laws and ordinances for them and to set spiritual Lords over them\".<ref>{{cite book |title= A Short Declaration on the Mystery of Iniquity|last= Helwys|first= Thomas|year= 1612}};</ref> [[James I of England|King James I]] had Helwys thrown into Newgate prison, where he had died by 1616 at about the age of forty.\n\nBy the time of the English Revolution Helwys' stance on religious toleration was more commonplace. However, whilst accepting their zeal in desiring a 'godly society', some contemporary historians doubt whether the English [[Puritans]] during the English Revolution were as committed to religious liberty and pluralism as traditional histories have suggested. However, historian John Coffey's recent work<ref>Coffey, John (1998) \"Puritanism & Liberty Revisited: The Case for Toleration in the English Revolution\", ''The Historical Journal'', Cambridge University Press.</ref> emphasises the contribution of a minority of radical Protestants who steadfastly sought toleration for heresy, blasphemy, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], non-Christian religions, and even [[atheism]]. This minority included the Seekers, as well as the [[General Baptists]] and the [[Levellers]]. Their collective witness demanded the church be an entirely voluntary, non-coercive community able to evangelise in a pluralistic society governed by a purely civil state. Such a demand was in sharp contrast to the ambitions of the magisterial Protestantism of the Calvinist majority.\n\nIn 1644 the \"Augustinian consensus concerning persecution was irreparably fractured.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 47.</ref> This year can be identified quite exactly, because 1644 saw the publication of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'', [[William Walwyn]]'s ''The Compassionate Samaritane'', [[Henry Robinson (writer)|Henry Robinson]]'s ''Liberty of Conscience'' and [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger William]]'s ''[[The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution]].'' These authors were Puritans or had dissented from the Church of England, and their radical Protestantism led them to condemn religious persecution, which they saw as a popish corruption of primitive Christianity.<ref name=Coffey50>Coffey 2000: 50.</ref> Other non-Anglican writers advocating toleration were [[Richard Overton (pamphleteer)|Richard Overton]], [[John Wildman]] and [[John Goodwin (preacher)|John Goodwin]], the Baptists [[Samuel Richardson (Baptist)|Samuel Richardson]] and [[Thomas Collier (Unitarian)|Thomas Collier]] and the Quakers [[Samuel Fisher (quaker)|Samuel Fisher]] and [[William Penn]]. Anglicans who argued against persecution were: [[John Locke]], [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury]], [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], [[Jeremy Taylor]],  [[Henry More]], [[John Tillotson]] and [[Gilbert Burnet]].<ref>This list is taken from: Coffey (2000), 50</ref>\n\nAll of these considered themselves Christians or were actual churchmen.

It states: \"2. The Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to religious freedom. Freedom of this kind means that all men should be immune from coercion on the part of individuals, social groups and every human power so that, within due limits, nobody is forced to act against his convictions in religious matters in private or public, alone or in associations with others. The Vatican Council further declares that the right of religious freedom is based on the very word of God and by reason itself. This right of the human person to religious freedom must be given such recognition in the constitutional order of society as will make it a civic right...but if it [the civil authority] presumes to control or restrict religious activity it must be said to have exceeded the limits of its power...Therefore, provided the just requirements of public order are not violated, these groups [i.e. religious communities] have a right to immunity so that they may organize their own lives according to their religious principles...From this it follows that it is wrong for a public authority to compel its citizens by force or fear or any other means to profess or repudiate any religion or to prevent anyone from joining or leaving a religious body. There is even more serious transgression of God's will and of the sacred rights of the individual person and the family of nations when force is applied to wipe out or repress religion either throughout the whole world or in a single region or in a particular community\".<ref>Austin Flannery (General Editor), Vatican Council II - The Conciliar and Post Concilliar Documents, 1981 Edition</ref>\n\nOn 12 March 2000 [[Pope John Paul II]] prayed for forgiveness because \"Christians have often denied the Gospel; yielding to a mentality of power, they have violated the rights of ethnic groups and peoples, and shown contempt for their cultures and religious traditions\" <ref>{{cite web|title=POPE JOHN PAUL II ASKS FOR FORGIVENESS|date=March 12, 2000|access-date=April 16, 2007 |url=http://www.sacredheart.edu/faithservice/centerforchristianandjewishunderstanding/documentsandstatements/popejohnpauliiasksforforgivenessmarch122000/|publisher=[[Sacred Heart University]]}}</ref>\n\nCardinal Joseph Ratzinger ([[Pope Benedict XVI]]) wrote \"The quality of exemplarity which the honest admission of past faults can exert on attitudes within the Church and civil society should also be noted, for it gives rise to a renewed obedience to the Truth and to respect for the dignity and the rights of others, most especially, of the very weak.

During [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]], Christians considered [[Christian heresy|heresy]] and [[Dissenter|dissent]] punishable offenses. However, [[Early modern Europe]] witnessed the turning point in the '''history of Christian thought on persecution and tolerance'''. Christian writers like [[John Milton]] and [[John Locke]] argued for limited religious toleration, while some Christians eventually came to support the concept of [[Freedom of religion|religious freedom]] which was developed by deists like [[Thomas Jefferson]]. Contemporary Christians generally agree that heresy and dissent are not punishable offenses.<ref name=\"Coffey00-206\">Coffey 2000: 206.</ref>\n\n==Historical background ==\n====Early Christianity====\n\n[[Early Christianity]] was a minority religion in the [[Roman Empire]] and [[Persecution of early Christians by the Romans|the early Christians were persecuted, on and off, during their first 300 years]]. Christianity's definition and practice of tolerance/intolerance were influenced by that persecution in a largely negative way. However, according to Guy Stroumsa, there is still a history in early Christian thought of tolerance as a concept, though not a fully developed one, and with some ambivalence, presenting both inclusivity and inventing the concept of heresy in Christian thought.<ref name=\"Stroumsa\">{{cite book|last=Stroumsa|first=Guy|editor1=Graham N.Stanton|editor2=Guy G.

At the same time a Germanic tribe, the Lombards, were gaining in Italy, another Germanic  tribe, the Franks were establishing their rule in what had been Roman Gaul and would become modern France. Clovis the first, a convert to Latin Christianity, became the first important ruler of  the Merovingian dynasty. He supported missionaries in newly conquered territories and strengthened ties with the Pope. After 700, the Merovongians gradually lost control of the kingdom to the Carolingians.  In 754, the Pope traveled to St.Denis, near Paris, to crown Pepin the Short king and name him defender of the faith. In exchange, Pepin crushed the Lombards and gave their land to the Pope. This alliance suited both parties, and redirected the church's interest away from the East, linking Rome's destiny with the West.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|198\u2013199}}\n\nConstantine used forced conversion and his Bishop Alcuin wrote him a rebuke against it.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|200\u2013201}}\n\nThe crusades evidence a dramatic shift in Christian thought on tolerance and persecution.\n\n====High Middle Ages====\n\nFeudalism declined and persecution changed during the High Middle Ages as kings began centralizing power into themselves and the state.  Under feudalism, a noble Lord gave military support to his king, but when so many nobles sold or leased their land and left for the East on crusade, kings began building armies of mercenaries for themselves and taking over legal processes that had traditionally been local. This process led to the development of persecution of minorities between the tenth to the thirteenth centuries in Europe.<ref name =\"Moore\">{{cite book|last=Moore|first=R.

Inquisitions were formed. The church began passing the punishment of heretics to the civil authorities who practiced corporal punishments and death.\n\nAlso during the high Middle Ages, 1000\u20131250, the [[Crusades]] continued to pitch Christians and Muslims against each other in wars lasting into the late middle ages with massacres and atrocities on both sides.\n\n====Late Middle Ages====\nAfter the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and the later [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsardom]] had conquered the [[Kazan Khanate|Kazan]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate]]s in the 1550s, the [[History of Tatarstan|government forcibly baptized]] Muslim [[Volga Tatars]] and pagan [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], [[Mordva]] and [[Mari people|Mari]]. Mosques were banned. This persecution only ended during the reign of [[Catherine II of Russia]] in the late eighteenth century.\n\nThe [[Northern Crusades]], a series of campaigns against the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of northeastern Europe, faced fierce pagan resistance, requiring decades of violence by dedicated [[Teutonic Order|warrior-monks]] to force the submission, and compel the conversion, of the region's inhabitants, who were often left as serfs to an imported Christian [[Baltic Germans|German-speaking nobility]].<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15.</ref> There were often severe consequences for populations that chose to resist; for example, the Christian conquest and conversion of Old Prussia resulted in the death of much of the native population, whose [[Old Prussian|language]] subsequently became extinct.<ref name=\"The German Hansa page 34\">The German Hansa, P. Dollinger, page 34, 1999, Routledge</ref>\n  \nThe [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]]s also went on to persecute Jews and Muslims. In Spain after the [[Reconquista]], Jews were forced to either convert or be exiled. Many were killed. The persecution of Jews goes back to 12th-century Spain after the emergence of the [[blood libel against Jews]]. Although the Spanish had agreed to grant Muslims the right to freely practice their religion in 1492, this promise was frequently broken. In 1501, Muslims were offered the choice of conversion or exile. In 1556, Arab or Muslim dress was forbidden, and in 1566 the Arabic language as a whole was prohibited in Spain.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lapidus | first =  Ira M. | title = A History of Islamic societes | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1988 | isbn = 0-521-22552-3| page = 389}}</ref> Jews were eventually expelled from England by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], too.\n\n====Reformation Era====\n\nWhen [[Martin Luther]] wrote his [[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]] in 1517, Catholicism reacted the same way as it had to the heresies of the late Middle Ages. However, while the [[Protestant Reformation]] could be \"crushed\" in Spain with \"a few dozen executions in the 1550s\",<ref>Coffey 2000: 212</ref> the same strategy failed in Germany, Northern Europe and in England. France had to suffer through the [[French Wars of Religion]] before it again became wholly Catholic. The divide between [[Catholicism]] and  the new [[Protestantism|Protestant denominations]] was deep. Protestants commonly alleged that the catholic [[Pope]] was the [[Antichrist]]. Conflicts between Christian factions reached their heights in France with the 1572 [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], in Germany and [[Central Europe]] with the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) and in England with the [[English Civil War]] (1641\u20131651). Following the devastations caused by these wars, the ideas of [[religious toleration]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[religious pluralism]] slowly gained ground in Europe. The [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe]], which had reached their height between 1550 and 1650, continued until 1750.\n\n====Early Modern Era====\n\nEuropean [[Colonialism]], that was accompanied by Christian evangelism and often by violence, led to the suppression of [[Folk religion|indigenous religions]] in the territories conquered or usurped by the Europeans. The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] largely destroyed the [[Aztec]] and [[Inca civilization]]. However, Colonialism (and later European [[Imperialism]]) as a whole were not motivated by religious zeal; the suppression of the indigenous religions was their side result, not their main purpose. Only partial aspects, like the [[Goa Inquisition]], bear resemblance to the persecutions that occurred on the European continent. By the 18th century, persecutions of unsanctioned beliefs had been reduced in most Europeans countries to [[religious discrimination]], in the form of legal restrictions on those who did not accept the official faith. This often included being barred from higher education, or from participation in the national legislature. In colonized nations, attempts to convert native peoples to Christianity became more encouraging and less forceful. In British India during the Victorian era, Christian converts were given preferential treatment for governmental appointments.\n\n====Modern Era====\nAt the present time, most countries in which Christianity is the religion of the majority of the people, are either [[secular state]]s or they embrace the [[separation of Church and State]] in another way.

Charlemagne was king. As king, he advocated Christian principles, had at least one Christian advisor, and openly supported Christian missions. The Franks had been fighting the Saxons since  Charlemagne's grandfather, with Charlemagne himself beginning in earnest in 772, taking years to finally defeat them.  They made treaties.  The events of 782 began when Widukind, the Saxon leader, persuaded a group of Saxons who had submitted to Charlemagne, to break their treaty and rebel. Charlemagne was elsewhere, so they went to battle with the Frankish army that had been left behind and annihilated it.  They killed two of the King\u2019s chief lieutenants, and some of his closest companions and counsellors. Charlemagne gathered his forces, returned to Saxony, conquered the Saxon rebels, giving them the option of convert or die. The Saxons largely refused, and though no one knows the number for sure, it is said 4500 unarmed prisoners were murdered in what is called the \"[[Massacre of Verden]].\" Massive deportations followed, and death was decreed as the penalty for any Saxon who refused baptism thereafter.<ref name =\"Logan\">{{cite book|last=Logan|first=F.

Clouse:<ref name=\"Clouse\"/>{{rp|18}}<blockquote>It is clear from the crusades that what finally overpowered the early Christian teaching against violence was not merely a just war theory but rather a merger of violence and holiness at all levels of Christian life. ... The liturgy was expanded to include the blessing of weapons and standards. Knights were consecrated by ceremonies which were often a revival of old pagan customs.  There were new militant religious orders established such as the Templars who promised to fight the enemies of God in addition to taking the normal vows of poverty, chastity and obedience.  When violence became sacred, the enemy was believed to be diabolical.  Thus the Turks were looked upon as opponents of the kingdom of God, a fulfillment of the forces of the antichrist as predicted in the book of Revelation.</blockquote>\n\nThis view of holiness and violence as merged in Christian thought is supported in Riley-Smith who says the crusades were products of the renewed spirituality of the central Middle Ages, with its concern for living the [[Vita apostolica|''vita apostolica'']] and expressing Christian ideals in active works of charity, exemplified by the new hospitals, the pastoral work of the Augustinians and Premonstratensians, and the service of the friars.

All the men who marched from town to town, burning, killing, raping and looting, were from northern France.  And, under law in the Middle Ages, the lands of defeated barons could be legally confiscated. Moore says the Pope supplied an excuse for something the king wanted anyway.

They began to harass the mercenaries and pilgrims of the crusader army. A brawl ensued. Soon the attackers from the town found themselves outnumbered and they retreated back into the town in disarray. The mercenaries quickly took advantage of the chaos and followed their retreat, storming the walls of the city that were not yet properly manned. The walls were easily taken, and the mercenaries entered the gate, seemingly without orders from their leaders. The crusader knights, soon realizing that the defenses had been broken, joined the mercenaries in battle, easily overwhelming the town garrison.

It included the Episcopal Inquisition (1184\u20131230s) which began when Pope Lucius the third issued a decree through the papal bull ''Ad abolendam,'' and the Papal Inquisition, which started in the 1230s. Canon law was still developing at this time, and it was based on Roman law to such a degree that it can be said the church reintroduced Roman law in Europe in the form of the Inquisition when it seemed that Germanic law had failed.<ref name=\"Monter\">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Inquisition, The: The Inquisition In The Old World|author=William Monter|date=April 7, 2020|publisher=Encyclopedia.com| url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/environment/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/inquisition-inquisition-old-world}}</ref>  In the Late Roman Empire, an inquisitorial system of justice had developed that allowed magistrates to investigate crimes in the absence of formal charges. The roles of evidence collector, prosecutor, and judge were combined in the inquisitor.  This inquisitorial process was in place when the Roman Empire converted to Christianity in the fourth century and it is the system that was revived in the middle ages. As a result, in his decretal of 1199, ''Vergentis in senium'', [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]] (1198\u20131216), took the crucial step of combining heresy with the Roman-law doctrine of ''l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9'', thereby accusing heretics of treason against God.<ref name=\"Monter\"/>\n\nThe cultural and religious process of centralizing power included the development, between the tenth to the thirteenth centuries, of a new kind of persecution aimed at minorities who provided much of the fodder for inquisition.<ref name =\"Moore\"/>  For example, Peter Comestor (d.1197) was the first influential scholar to interpret biblical injunctions against sodomy as referring specifically to homosexual intercourse. The Third Lateran council of 1179 then became the first to legislate on it as deserving of being deprived of office or excommunicated.<ref name=\"Moore\"/>{{rp|87}} The Fourth Lateran council reduced those penalties, but later Gregory IX ordered the Dominicans to extirpate homosexuality from Germany.  A series of legal codes were thereafter promulgated from the 1250s on in Spain, France, Italy and Germany. By 1300, places where sodomy was not a capitol offense had become the exception rather than the rule.<ref name=\"Moore\"/>{{rp|87}}\n\nThe historian Robert Moore says most complex traditional societies, including those in early and medieval Europe, have always contained some kind of persecution that occurred and subsided and occurred again, but that twelfth century Europe's persecution was more serious because it was characterized by the demonization of the accused, a new attitude, and mechanisms such as the inquisitions, a new method.<ref name=\"Moore\"/>{{rp|154}}\n\n===The Jews===\nIn the centuries after the fall of the Roman empire, Jews established small communities, engaged in commerce, and were seldom singled out as targets of verbal abuse or physical violence.<ref name=\"Berger\">{{cite book|last=Berger|first=D|title=New Perspectives on Jewish-Christian Relations: In Honor of David Berger| year=2012|publisher=Brill|location=Netherlands|isbn=978-9-00422-117-8}}</ref>{{rp|2}}  However, historians agree that the eleventh to the thirteenth century was a turning point in Jewish-Christian relations.<blockquote> \"[[Bernard of Clairvaux]], (1090-1153) pillar of European monasticism and powerful twelfth century preacher, provides a perfect example of a Christian thinker balancing on a precipice, preaching hateful images of Jews at the same time as he sounded Scripture based admonitions that they must be protected despite their nature.<ref name=\"Berger\"/>{{rp|2}}</blockquote> Low level theological repartee had long existed between Jews and Christians.

For the first time in history, Jews had to answer in public trial. There is no consensus in the sources as to who instigated the trial against the Talmud, but in June of 1239, [[Gregory IX]] (1237-1241) issued letters to various Archbishops and Kings across Europe to seize all Jewish books and take them to the Dominicans for examination.  The order was heeded only in Paris where, on June 25th, the Royal court was opened to hear the case. Eventually, each side claimed victory; a final verdict of guilt and condemnation was not announced until May of 1248, but the books had been burned six years before.<ref name=\"Rosenthal\">{{cite journal|last=Rosenthal|first= Judah M.|title=The Talmud on Trial: The Disputation at Paris in the Year 1240|journal= The Jewish Quarterly Review|volume= 47| issue= 1|year= 1956|pages=58\u201376|publisher= JSTOR|doi= 10.2307/1453186|jstor= 1453186}}</ref>{{rp|68-72}}  \n\nAs a result of this trial, the people of Europe thought that, even if they had once had an obligation to preserve the Jews for the sake of the Old Testament, Talmudic Judaism was so different from its biblical sources that the old obligation no longer applied.

The unique culture of the High middle ages with its union of the spiritual and the secular began to come apart. Rival European states at war with each other dimmed the church's dream of a united Christendom.  New military weapons and tactics rendered chivalry obsolete.  In the Universities, new intellectual currents moved away from Christian thought, and new secular voices began to be heard. <ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|243,248}}\n\nFrom its pinnacle of power in the 1200s, the church entered a period of decline, internal conflict, and corruption.  Devoted and virtuous nuns and monks become increasingly rare. Monastic reform had been a major force in the High Middle Ages but is largely unknown in the Late Middle ages. This led to the development of lay piety--the ''devotio moderna''--the new devotion, which worked toward the ideal of a pious society of ordinary non-ordained people.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|248-250}}\n\nLeaders who attempted to reform the church in England and Bohemia met strong resistance from the Popes. [[John Wycliffe]] (1320-1384) urged the church to give up ownership of property, which produced much of the church's wealth, and to once again embrace poverty and simplicity. He urged the church to stop being subservient to the state and its politics. He denied papal authority. John Wycliff died of a stroke, but his followers, called ''Lollards,'' were declared heretics.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|249}}  The first large scale attack on the Lollards came the year after the [[Peasant revolt]] of 1381.

These tactics were particularly widely used in the [[Northern Crusades]], where Christian rulers \u2013 and, later, monastic orders such as the [[Teutonic Knights]] \u2013 waged a centuries-long series of campaigns to compel the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of the region to convert by conquering them and settling in the newly conquered territory as feudal rulers.<ref>Christiansen, Eric.

Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1988. p.g. 157-158</ref> An example of how the use of forced conversion was justified, in the medieval Church, as compatible with previous Church doctrine on the subject can be found for instance in a statement made by [[Pope Innocent III]] in 1201 about those who agreed to be baptized to avoid torture and intimidation:\n\n<blockquote>[T]hose who are immersed even though reluctant, do belong to ecclesiastical jurisdiction at least by reason of the sacrament, and might therefore be reasonably compelled to observe the rules of the Christian Faith. It is, to be sure, contrary to the Christian Faith that anyone who is unwilling and wholly opposed to it should be compelled to adopt and observe Christianity. For this reason a valid distinction is made by some between kinds of unwilling ones and kinds of compelled ones. Thus one who is drawn to Christianity by violence, through fear and through torture, and receives the sacrament of Baptism in order to avoid loss, he (like one who comes to Baptism in dissimulation) does receive the impress of Christianity, and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling ...<ref>Chazan, Robert, ed., Church, State, and Jew in the Middle Ages, West Orange, NJ:Behrman House, 1980, p. 103.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn addition to sponsoring forced conversion, the Church accepted the use of forced conversion as a pretext for the elimination of hostile or recalcitrant tribes that did not easily submit to conquest.<ref>Fonnesberg-Schmidt, Iben. \u201cPope Honorius III and Mission and Crusades in the Baltic Region\u201d.

The Reformers \"fully embraced\" Augustine's advocacy of coercion in religious matters, and many regarded the death penalty for heresy as legitimate.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" />  Furthermore, by presenting a much more powerful threat to Catholic unity than the heretic groups of the Middle Ages, the Reformation led to the intensification of persecution under Catholic regimes.\n\n*[[Martin Luther]] had written against persecution in the 1520s, and had demonstrated genuine sympathy towards the Jews in his earlier writings, especially in ''Das Jesus ein geborener Jude sei'' (''That Jesus was born as a Jew'') from 1523,  but after 1525 his position hardened. In ''Wider die Sabbather an einen guten Freund'' (Against the Sabbather to a Good Friend), 1538, he still considered a conversion of the Jews to Christianity as possible,<ref>Thomas Kaufmann, 2005: ''Luthers \"Judenschriften in ihren historischen Kontexten'' (Nachrichten der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu G\u00f6ttingen) {{in lang|de}}, p. 526</ref> but in 1543 he published [[On the Jews and their Lies]], a \"violent anti-semitic tract.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 23, 24</ref>\n*[[John Calvin]] helped to secure the execution for heresy of [[Michael Servetus]],<ref>Coffey 2000: 24.</ref> although he unsuccessfully requested that he should be beheaded instead of being burned at the stake.\n\nEffectively, however, the 16th-century Protestant view was less extreme than the mediaeval Catholic position. In England, [[John Foxe]], [[John Hales]], [[Richard Perrinchief]], [[Herbert Thorndike]] and [[Jonas Proast]] all only saw mild forms of persecution against the [[English Dissenters]] as legitimate.<ref>see Coffey 2000: 24,25.</ref> But (with the probable exception of John Foxe), this was only a retraction in degree, not a full rejection of religious persecution.  There is also the crucial distinction between ''dissent'' and ''heresy'' to consider. Most dissenters disagreed with the Anglican Church only on secondary matters of worship and ecclesiology, and although this was a considered a serious sin, only a few 17th-century Anglican writers thought that this 'crime' deserved the death penalty.<ref name=\"Coffey00-25\">Coffey 2000: 25</ref> These concerns notwithstanding, the English government saw fit to execute as treasonous a multitude of priests, dissenters, and recusant Catholics, even those who retained but private reservations.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The English Act of Supremacy thus significantly complicated the matter by securely welding Church and state.\n\nThe Elizabethan bishop [[Thomas Bilson]] was of the opinion that men ought to be \"corrected, not murdered\",  but he did not condemn the Christian Emperors for executing the [[Manichaeans]] for \"monstrous blasphemies\".<ref>Coffey 2000: 24,26; Thomas Bilson 1585, ''The True Difference between Christian Subjection and Unchristian Rebellion'', pp. 19,20, 383.</ref> The Lutheran theologian [[Georgius Calixtus]] argued for the reconciliation of Christendom by removing all unimportant differences between Catholicism and Protestantism, and [[Rupertus Meldenius]] advocated [[in necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas]] (''in necessary things unity; in uncertain things freedom; in everything compassion'') in 1626.\n\n==Protestant advocacy of toleration==\n\n===The English Protestant 'Call for Toleration'===\nWhile the Christian theologians mentioned above advocated religious persecution to various extents, it was also Christians who helped pioneer the concept of [[religious toleration]].\n\nIn his book on 'The English Reformation', particularly in the chapter 'The Origins of Religious Toleration', the late [[A. G. Dickens]] argued that from the beginning of the Reformation there had \"existed in Protestant thought \u2013 in [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]] and [[Martin Bucer|Bucer]], as well as among the Anabaptists \u2013 a more liberal tradition, which [[John Frith]] was perhaps the first echo in England\".<ref>{{cite book |title= The English Reformation|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 438}};</ref> Condemned for heresy, Frith was burnt at the stake in 1533. In his own mind, he died not because of the denial of the doctrines on purgatory and transubstantiation but \"for the principle that a particular doctrine on either point was not a necessary part of a Christian's faith\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\">{{cite book |title= The English Reformation|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 116}};</ref> In other words, there was an important distinction to be made between a genuine article of faith and other matters where a variety of very different conclusions should be tolerated within the Church. This stand against unreasonable and profligate dogmatism meant that Frith, \"to a greater extent than any other of our early Protestants\", upheld \"a certain degree of religious freedom\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\"/>\n\nFrith was not alone. [[John Foxe]], for example, \"strove hard to save Anabaptists from the fire, and he enunciated a sweeping doctrine of tolerance even towards Catholics, whose doctrines he detested with every fibre of his being\".<ref>{{cite book |title= The English Reformation|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|pages= 439\u2013440}};</ref>\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Thomas Helwys]] was principal formulator of that distinctively [[Baptist]] request: that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law, so that individuals might have a freedom of religious conscience. Helwys said the King \"is a mortal man, and not God, therefore he hath no power over the mortal soul of his subjects to make laws and ordinances for them and to set spiritual Lords over them\".<ref>{{cite book |title= A Short Declaration on the Mystery of Iniquity|last= Helwys|first= Thomas|year= 1612}};</ref> [[James I of England|King James I]] had Helwys thrown into Newgate prison, where he had died by 1616 at about the age of forty.\n\nBy the time of the English Revolution Helwys' stance on religious toleration was more commonplace. However, whilst accepting their zeal in desiring a 'godly society', some contemporary historians doubt whether the English [[Puritans]] during the English Revolution were as committed to religious liberty and pluralism as traditional histories have suggested. However, historian John Coffey's recent work<ref>Coffey, John (1998) \"Puritanism & Liberty Revisited: The Case for Toleration in the English Revolution\", ''The Historical Journal'', Cambridge University Press.</ref> emphasises the contribution of a minority of radical Protestants who steadfastly sought toleration for heresy, blasphemy, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], non-Christian religions, and even [[atheism]]. This minority included the Seekers, as well as the [[General Baptists]] and the [[Levellers]]. Their collective witness demanded the church be an entirely voluntary, non-coercive community able to evangelise in a pluralistic society governed by a purely civil state. Such a demand was in sharp contrast to the ambitions of the magisterial Protestantism of the Calvinist majority.\n\nIn 1644 the \"Augustinian consensus concerning persecution was irreparably fractured.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 47.</ref> This year can be identified quite exactly, because 1644 saw the publication of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'', [[William Walwyn]]'s ''The Compassionate Samaritane'', [[Henry Robinson (writer)|Henry Robinson]]'s ''Liberty of Conscience'' and [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger William]]'s ''[[The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution]].''

Patterson, ''Early Modern Liberalism'', Cambridge 1997</ref>  Only from the 1690s onwards the philosophy of [[Deism]] emerged, and with it a third group that advocated religious toleration, but, unlike the radical Protestants and the Anglicans, also rejected biblical authority; this group prominently includes [[Voltaire]], [[Frederick II of Prussia]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and the English-Irish philosopher [[John Toland]].<ref name=\"Coffey50\" /> When Toland published the writings of Milton, [[Edmund Ludlow]] and [[Algernon Sidney]], he tried to downplay the Puritan divinity in these works.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/>\n\nThe [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], issued the [[Patent of Toleration]] in 1781.\n\n===Developments in 17th-century England===\n\n{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}\nFollowing the debates that started in the 1640s the [[Church of England]] was the first Christian church to grant adherents of other [[Christian denominations]] freedom of worship, with the [[Act of Toleration 1689]], which  nevertheless still retained some forms of [[religious discrimination]] and did not include toleration for Catholics.

For some Christians, different sects of Christianity represent \"different religions.\" These people thus mistake the survey term \"many religions\" to mean \"different sects of Christianity,\" even though that is not the commonly intended use of the phrase. What the survey really shows is that more US Christians believe that God can make himself known through multiple Christian sects, than believe that He can make Himself known even through other religions. It is worth noting that a majority of US Christians take the more inclusive stance.)\n\n==The mid-20th-century Spanish model==\n{{Separation of church and state in the history of the Catholic Church|expanded = 20th}}\n\nAs of the mid-20th century, an example of Catholic church-state relations was the Catholic situation in [[Spain under Franco|Franco's Spain]], where according to the doctrine of [[National Catholicism]] the Catholic Church:\n* was officially recognized and protected by the state,\n* had substantial control over social policy, and\n* had this relationship explicitly set out in a [[Concordat]].\nIt had long been the policy of the Catholic Church to support [[toleration]] of competing religions under such a scheme, but it also supported legal restrictions on attempts to convert Catholics to those same religions, under the motto that \"error has no rights\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n==Modern Roman Catholic policy==\nOn the seventh of December 1965 The Catholic Church's [[Vatican II]] council issued the decree \"[[Dignitatis humanae]]\" which dealt with the rights of the person and communities to social and civil liberty in religious matters. It states: \"2. The Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to religious freedom. Freedom of this kind means that all men should be immune from coercion on the part of individuals, social groups and every human power so that, within due limits, nobody is forced to act against his convictions in religious matters in private or public, alone or in associations with others. The Vatican Council further declares that the right of religious freedom is based on the very word of God and by reason itself. This right of the human person to religious freedom must be given such recognition in the constitutional order of society as will make it a civic right...but if it [the civil authority] presumes to control or restrict religious activity it must be said to have exceeded the limits of its power...Therefore, provided the just requirements of public order are not violated, these groups [i.e. religious communities] have a right to immunity so that they may organize their own lives according to their religious principles...From this it follows that it is wrong for a public authority to compel its citizens by force or fear or any other means to profess or repudiate any religion or to prevent anyone from joining or leaving a religious body. There is even more serious transgression of God's will and of the sacred rights of the individual person and the family of nations when force is applied to wipe out or repress religion either throughout the whole world or in a single region or in a particular community\".<ref>Austin Flannery (General Editor), Vatican Council II - The Conciliar and Post Concilliar Documents, 1981 Edition</ref>\n\nOn 12 March 2000 [[Pope John Paul II]] prayed for forgiveness because \"Christians have often denied the Gospel; yielding to a mentality of power, they have violated the rights of ethnic groups and peoples, and shown contempt for their cultures and religious traditions\" <ref>{{cite web|title=POPE JOHN PAUL II ASKS FOR FORGIVENESS|date=March 12, 2000|access-date=April 16, 2007 |url=http://www.sacredheart.edu/faithservice/centerforchristianandjewishunderstanding/documentsandstatements/popejohnpauliiasksforforgivenessmarch122000/|publisher=[[Sacred Heart University]]}}</ref>\n\nCardinal Joseph Ratzinger ([[Pope Benedict XVI]]) wrote \"The quality of exemplarity which the honest admission of past faults can exert on attitudes within the Church and civil society should also be noted, for it gives rise to a renewed obedience to the Truth and to respect for the dignity and the rights of others, most especially, of the very weak.
