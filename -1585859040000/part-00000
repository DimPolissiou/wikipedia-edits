It was created by Colette Burson and Dmitry Lipkin and stars [[Thomas Jane]] as Ray Drecker, a struggling suburban Detroit high school basketball and baseball coach who resorts to [[male prostitution]]. The second season premiered on June 27, 2010, and concluded its 10-episode run on September 12, 2010.

He is also the father of twin teenagers ([[Charlie Saxton]] and [[Sianoa Smit-McPhee]]), who move in with their remarried mother ([[Anne Heche]]) after a fire damages the childhood home Ray still owns.  With no insurance to cover the damage from the fire, Ray is left without many options. With the help of a friend, Tanya ([[Jane Adams (actress)|Jane Adams]]), Ray decides to use his above-average sized, 9-inch penis as an opportunity to make money. The episodes centre on Ray's attempts to maintain a normal life while starting his business as a prostitute. Together, Tanya and Ray start their business, \"Happiness Consultants\".\n\nThe second season focuses on the complex dynamic between Ray and his two pimps, Tanya and Lenore ([[Rebecca Creskoff]]). Lenore, a life coach whom Tanya brought in to help them in the early stages of the business, began taking over Happiness Consultants late in the first season, as she believes she can take Ray into new business areas and views Tanya as an obstacle.\n\nThe third season has Tanya and Ray forced to compete for clients against Lenore and her younger [[gigolo]] Jason ([[Stephen Amell]]).\n\n==Production==\nThe show's pilot was directed by filmmaker [[Alexander Payne]], who served as [[executive producer]] along with Burson, Lipkin, and Blueprint Entertainment. Burson and Lipkin's script was the first major purchase by the network's new entertainment president Sue Naegle in April 2008. This led the writers to immediately work on five more episodes for the series, a total of 10 episodes. On December 18, 2008, HBO announced picking up the series for its first season, which ran from June 28, 2009, to September 13, 2009.

Guest stars in this episode include [[Joe Strummer]], [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Ween]], [[Primus (band)|Primus]], [[Elton John]], [[Meat Loaf]], [[Rick James]], and [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]].\n\nIn the episode, Chef tries to claim that Alanis Morissette plagiarized his song \"Stinky Britches\". However, the record company executive decides to sue him for harassment for this.

Chef now has 24 hours to come up with the money or face four years of incarceration. Chef makes money by becoming a [[male prostitution|prostitute]]; instead of paying the executive, he intends to hire Cochran so ''he'' can sue the record company. Unfortunately, Chef's money is seized and he is sent to jail the next day.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Mr. Garrison]] witnesses many strange attempts on Mr. Twig's life; he finds him boiling in a pot of water, and later snapped in half. The evidence begins to point to Mr. Hat as the culprit, culminating in a showdown between Mr. Garrison and Mr. Hat which lands the former in jail. Mr. Hat breaks Mr. Garrison and Chef out of their cell. Mr. Garrison and Mr. Hat eventually make up their differences and get back together.\n\nThe boys try to help Chef by rounding up various musicians, whose careers have been boosted by Chef's advice, to hold a [[benefit concert]].

Anthony uses his poetry to try to make sense of his situation. Using a non-chronological style, the v\u00e9rit\u00e9-style drama explores youthful impulsivity and perilous street life.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film explores isolation and loss in the urban landscape of San Francisco.  The story unfolds through the non-sequential memories of its central character, Anthony.  Taking a bus to an undisclosed destination, he grapples with the loss of the only two meaningful relationships he established since arriving in the city.\n\nHe relives telltale moments with his volatile lover, Stephen.  Having met Stephen only briefly in Virginia, Anthony decides to leave his rural life and head west to California for a domestic urban life.  His exciting new life quickly sours as Anthony encounters Stephen's anger and manipulative behaviors.  As he relies on Stephen financially and emotionally, Anthony does not know where to turn when their arguments evolve to physical violence.\n\nHe quickly slips into social and spiritual-paralysis.  Unable to pursue his dream of writing poetry, Anthony goes out night after night, encountering a number of other drifters, including a crooning transgender woman, homeless youth, and drug dealers.\n\nEventually he meets Gavin, a runaway teen hustler living on the streets. Almost effortlessly, Gavin comes and goes, unexpectedly becoming a playful and nurturing force in Anthony's life, even taking on a parental role at times.  Anthony comes to rely on Gavin's friendship until Stephen reemerges and asks Anthony to come back to him.  Gavin's street life becomes progressively more impossible for him to handle, and though Anthony tries to help him, he disappears without warning.  Hitting bottom in his emotional spiral, Anthony attempts to turn his life around by embarking on a mission to find his young friend.\n\n==Cast==\n*Raphael Barker as Anthony\n*Adam David as Gavin (as Adam Perez)\n*Kelly Sanchez as Jeremy\n*Scott Cox as Stephen\n*Goldie Chan as Nancy\n*Jesse Schoem as Drug Dealer\n*Matthew Bridges as Kevin\n*[[Jeffrey Weissman]] as Anthony's Co-Worker\n*Brian Levy as Pushy Trick\n*Veronica Klaus as Serenading Diva\n*Marc Scruggs as Terry\n*David Scott Keller as Greg\n\n==Production==\nFunded with private financing and small investments, the film was executive-produced by Scott Boswell through Paperback Films.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sf360.org/articles/q-and-a?pageid=12864|title=Sf360.org|website=www.sf360.org}}</ref> Originally conceived as a [[docufiction|hybrid documentary-fiction]] portrait about San Francisco's [[Tenderloin, San Francisco|Tenderloin district]], writer-director Boswell wrote the 108-page script only after casting lead actor Raphael Barker.
