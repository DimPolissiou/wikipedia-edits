She meets her at the Corinthos' house, Greystone Manor, during the birthday party of [[Bobbie Spencer]] ([[Jacklyn Zeman]]), and informs her about being her daughter, Josslyn's (Eden McCoy) kidney donor. When Carly asks for proof, she becomes upset and tells them she's not here for money. [[Sonny Corinthos|Sonny]] and [[Jasper Jacks|Jax]] don't believe her, and inform her about Carly being conned for money before. Nelle reacts badly and leaves. [[Michael Corinthos|Michael]] goes after her and convinces her to stay, she meets Joss when she approaches her, and they briefly bond after Nelle assists her with an app. After Joss leaves, Michael and Nelle head back to Corinthos house, agreeing to go to the hospital for the tests and is confirmed to be the donor. Joss learns the truth about Nelle being the one who saved her life and thanks her with a hug. Carly and Joss ask her to stay in Port Charles so they can get to know her. She starts working for Carly as her stepdaughter, [[Children of General Hospital#Avery Corinthos|Avery Corinthos]]' nanny, after the previous nanny gets fired for stealing Carly's earrings. Nelle loses her job after Bobbie offers to look after Avery. So Carly offers her a job of a personal assistant at the Metro Court Hotel which she accepts. In November 2016, she drugs Sonny and leads him to believe he had sex with her, as party of her revenge plot against Carly. Nelle struggles with her guilt, however, but continues to conspire against Carly at Sonny's expense.\n\nIn early 2017, Michael convinces Nelle to bury the hatred and focus on her future; she listens to him, and decides to stop scheming so she and Michael can be together and she can finally be happy. She deletes the recording after Michael leaves, but when she goes to Carly's office to destroy the package that contained the recording, Bobbie confronts her about her nasty doings. She goes to see Michael so she can tell him the truth, but they got interrupted, so when they go to her apartment for privacy they find his parents there who expose Nelle. When Michael asks for the truth, Nelle admits everything, but blames Carly for it. She reveals being Frank Benson's daughter, and how Carly called her father for her kidney when her daughter got sick when she never cared about them. Carly denies it and says she thought it was Jake Webber's kidney which Nelle refuses to believe. Sonny and Michael try to explain to Nelle that her own father screwed her over and not Carly, but she doesn't listen to them. After Carly and Sonny leave, Michael stays back and gives Nelle an ear full before leaving.\n\nNelle starts packing her things, so she can move out from the apartment given to her by Carly. That's when Joss shows up with the concert tickets, but Nelle blows her off and goes for a drink at The Floating Rib where she runs into Michael who tells her he will never forgive her for hurting his parents. Jax then meets her somewhere, and Nelle learns through him that her father used her after he shows her proof and she realizes everything. She tries to make things right by confessing to Sonny that they didn't sleep together, and later on confesses to Carly as well, but to no avail. After hearing what she has to say, Carly kicks her out of her house. Since she no longer had a job, [[General Hospital characters (2010s)#Nina Reeves|Nina Reeves]] ([[Michelle Stafford]]) hires her as a full-time nanny for [[Children of General Hospital#Charlotte Cassadine|Charlotte Cassadine]] (Scarlett Fernandez).\n\nWhen Jasper gets arrested for buying Nelle's kidney illegally, she goes to the station and makes a statement about not wanting to press charges, so the charges get dropped for which Jasper thanks her. When Jasper leaves, Carly thanks Nelle, but then asks her to stay away from her family especially Michael. She asks Carly \"when will it ever be enough for you to forgive me?\" To which Carly replies it doesn't change what she did and she won't forgive her. Afterwards, Michael arrives at the station and misjudges Nelle, offering her a compensation if she doesn't press charges, oblivious that she saved Jax. When he learns the truth, he meets her at the docks while she's waiting for a boat to Wyndemere and apologizes to her. Nina presses her into spying on her husband, Valentin who she suspects is keeping secrets from her.\n\nIn June 2017, Nina hires Nelle to work as her executive assistant at Crimson; despite this, Nelle is later fired by Nina. When Michaels breaks up with Nelle, she admits she is pregnant with his baby. Nelle is later hired by [[Ava Jerome]] ([[Maura West]]) to work at the Jerome Gallery. Angered by her own belief that it was Carly's doing that led to her split from Michael, Nelle begins to manipulate Carly, in the hopes of making her lose her mind, by making anonymous calls near the site where [[Morgan Corinthos]] ([[Bryan Craig]]) died.\n\nDuring her baby shower, Nelle fell down a flight of stairs at the Quartermaine Mansion after getting into an argument with Carly, similar to the situation that happened to Carly years ago, when she lost her child on the same stairs.\n\nIn late 2018, she was visited by Charlotte's soon-to-be great-aunt [[Liesl Obrecht]] ([[Kathleen Gati]]) in prison after Nelle's male counterpart [[Peter August]] ([[Wes Ramsey]]) became the new owner of The Invader tabloid. In late 2019, when Brad visited her in Pentonville prison, she requested him to let her be a part of her son's life once she's out of prison after she met convicted serial killer [[List of General Hospital characters (1990s)#Ryan Chamberlain|Ryan Chamberlain]] ([[Jon Lindstrom]]). She shows up at the memorial service of Shiloh, and reveals that she was his wife.

She meets her at the Corinthos' house, Greystone Manor, during the birthday party of [[Bobbie Spencer]] ([[Jacklyn Zeman]]), and informs her about being her daughter, Josslyn's (Eden McCoy) kidney donor. When Carly asks for proof, she becomes upset and tells them she's not here for money. [[Sonny Corinthos|Sonny]] and [[Jasper Jacks|Jax]] don't believe her, and inform her about Carly being conned for money before. Nelle reacts badly and leaves. [[Michael Corinthos|Michael]] goes after her and convinces her to stay, she meets Joss when she approaches her, and they briefly bond after Nelle assists her with an app. After Joss leaves, Michael and Nelle head back to Corinthos house, agreeing to go to the hospital for the tests and is confirmed to be the donor. Joss learns the truth about Nelle being the one who saved her life and thanks her with a hug. Carly and Joss ask her to stay in Port Charles so they can get to know her. She starts working for Carly as her stepdaughter, [[Children of General Hospital#Avery Corinthos|Avery Corinthos]]' nanny, after the previous nanny gets fired for stealing Carly's earrings. Nelle loses her job after Bobbie offers to look after Avery. So Carly offers her a job of a personal assistant at the Metro Court Hotel which she accepts. In November 2016, she drugs Sonny and leads him to believe he had sex with her, as party of her revenge plot against Carly. Nelle struggles with her guilt, however, but continues to conspire against Carly at Sonny's expense.\n\nIn early 2017, Michael convinces Nelle to bury the hatred and focus on her future; she listens to him, and decides to stop scheming so she and Michael can be together and she can finally be happy. She deletes the recording after Michael leaves, but when she goes to Carly's office to destroy the package that contained the recording, Bobbie confronts her about her nasty doings. She goes to see Michael so she can tell him the truth, but they got interrupted, so when they go to her apartment for privacy they find his parents there who expose Nelle. When Michael asks for the truth, Nelle admits everything, but blames Carly for it. She reveals being Frank Benson's daughter, and how Carly called her father for her kidney when her daughter got sick when she never cared about them. Carly denies it and says she thought it was Jake Webber's kidney which Nelle refuses to believe. Sonny and Michael try to explain to Nelle that her own father screwed her over and not Carly, but she doesn't listen to them. After Carly and Sonny leave, Michael stays back and gives Nelle an ear full before leaving.\n\nNelle starts packing her things, so she can move out from the apartment given to her by Carly. That's when Joss shows up with the concert tickets, but Nelle blows her off and goes for a drink at The Floating Rib where she runs into Michael who tells her he will never forgive her for hurting his parents. Jax then meets her somewhere, and Nelle learns through him that her father used her after he shows her proof and she realizes everything. She tries to make things right by confessing to Sonny that they didn't sleep together, and later on confesses to Carly as well, but to no avail. After hearing what she has to say, Carly kicks her out of her house. Since she no longer had a job, [[General Hospital characters (2010s)#Nina Reeves|Nina Reeves]] ([[Michelle Stafford]]) hires her as a full-time nanny for [[Children of General Hospital#Charlotte Cassadine|Charlotte Cassadine]] (Scarlett Fernandez).\n\nWhen Jasper gets arrested for buying Nelle's kidney illegally, she goes to the station and makes a statement about not wanting to press charges, so the charges get dropped for which Jasper thanks her. When Jasper leaves, Carly thanks Nelle, but then asks her to stay away from her family especially Michael. She asks Carly \"when will it ever be enough for you to forgive me?\" To which Carly replies it doesn't change what she did and she won't forgive her. Afterwards, Michael arrives at the station and misjudges Nelle, offering her a compensation if she doesn't press charges, oblivious that she saved Jax. When he learns the truth, he meets her at the docks while she's waiting for a boat to Wyndemere and apologizes to her. Nina presses her into spying on her husband, Valentin who she suspects is keeping secrets from her.\n\nIn June 2017, Nina hires Nelle to work as her executive assistant at Crimson; despite this, Nelle is later fired by Nina. When Michaels breaks up with Nelle, she admits she is pregnant with his baby. Nelle is later hired by [[Ava Jerome]] ([[Maura West]]) to work at the Jerome Gallery. Angered by her own belief that it was Carly's doing that led to her split from Michael, Nelle begins to manipulate Carly, in the hopes of making her lose her mind, by making anonymous calls near the site where [[Morgan Corinthos]] ([[Bryan Craig]]) died.\n\nDuring her baby shower, Nelle fell down a flight of stairs at the Quartermaine Mansion after getting into an argument with Carly, similar to the situation that happened to Carly years ago, when she lost her child on the same stairs.\n\nIn late 2018, she was visited by Charlotte's soon-to-be great-aunt [[Liesl Obrecht]] ([[Kathleen Gati]]) in prison after Nelle's male counterpart [[Peter August]] ([[Wes Ramsey]]) became the new owner of The Invader tabloid. In late 2019, when Brad visited her in Pentonville prison, she requested him to let her be a part of her son's life once she's out of prison after she met convicted serial killer [[List of General Hospital characters (1990s)#Ryan Chamberlain|Ryan Chamberlain]] ([[Jon Lindstrom]]). She shows up at the memorial service of Shiloh, and reveals that she was his wife. In April 2020, it is revealed that Nelle is the long-lost daughter of Nina ([[Cynthia Watros]]).\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.soapcentral.com/gh/whoswho/nelle.php Nelle Hayes profile - SoapCentral.com]\n*http://soaps.sheknows.com/general-hospital/characters/nelle-hayes\n\n{{General Hospital}}\n{{General Hospital characters|present}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Benson, Nelle}}\n[[Category:Fictional adoptees]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 2016]]\n[[Category:General Hospital characters]]\n[[Category:Female characters in television]]\n", "name_user": "Livelikemusic", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelle_Benson"}

Extensive enclosure and drainage took place after 1766, and it briefly developed as a preferred place for Hull merchants in the 19th century. The future parish church, [[Saint John Newland|St John's]], was built in 1833, and in 1862 the ecclesiastical parish of Newland was established as separate from [[Cottingham, East Riding of Yorkshire|Cottingham]] in the East Riding.

on the Hull to Beverley turnpike.\n\nBefore the mid 18th century Newland was a hamlet in a partially swampy agricultural area, located near the crossroads of Cottingham and Beverley-Hull turnpikes.

Since force is a [[Vector (physics)|vector]] quantity, impulse is also a vector quantity. Impulse applied to an object produces an equivalent vector [[Mathematics#Change|change]] in its linear [[momentum]], also in the same direction. The [[International System of Units|SI]] unit of impulse is the [[newton second]] (N\u22c5s), and the [[dimensional analysis|dimensionally equivalent]] unit of momentum is the kilogram meter per second (kg\u22c5m/s).

C\u00e1rdenas was one of a group that fled to the island from the village of Saban, on the mainland, after an attack during the [[Caste War of Yucat\u00e1n]]in 1848.  The attackers killed other villagers, but C\u00e1rdenas survived whilst clutching a small wooden cross.\n\nLegend has it that C\u00e1rdenas vowed to start an annual festival wherever he settled, to honor the religious power of this crucifix. Today, the original Holy Cross (Santa Cruz) Festival forms part of the wider Festival of El Cedral, which includes fairs, traditional feasts, rodeos, bullfights, music and competitions.

This annual event is said to have been started over 150 years ago by Casimiro C\u00e1rdenas. C\u00e1rdenas was one of a group that fled to the island from the village of Saban, on the mainland, after an attack during the [[Caste War of Yucat\u00e1n]]in 1848.  The attackers killed other villagers, but C\u00e1rdenas survived whilst clutching a small wooden cross.\n\nLegend has it that C\u00e1rdenas vowed to start an annual festival wherever he settled, to honor the religious power of this crucifix. Today, the original Holy Cross (Santa Cruz) Festival forms part of the wider Festival of El Cedral, which includes fairs, traditional feasts, rodeos, bullfights, music and competitions. The celebrations last about 5 days in all and are held every year at the end of April or beginning of May.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cozumel.travel/event/fiestas-de-la-santa-cruz/|title=Cozumel Pr\u00f3ximos Eventos \u2013 Fiestas de la Santa Cruz|website=cozumel.travel|access-date=2016-03-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308181128/http://cozumel.travel/event/fiestas-de-la-santa-cruz/|archive-date=March 8, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Cozumel Carnival ===\nThe [[Cozumel Carnival]] or ''Carnaval de Cozumel'' is one of the most important carnival festivities in M\u00e9xico.
