Renamed ''Nahant'' and given the registry number ''SP-1250'', she was placed in commission at the beginning of December 1917.\n\n== World War I service ==\n \nOperating in the [[3rd Naval District]], ''Nahant'' performed towing tasks in [[New York Harbor]] for the rest of World War I and into the early post-war era.\n\n==  On loan to the City of New York ==\n\nDecommissioning early in 1920, ''Nahant'' was transferred to the City of New York and served the Police Department as ''Service No. 3'' and as ''John F.

She was employed as a tugboat in [[New York harbor]]. Post-war she was placed on loan with the City of New York until 1928, when she was disposed of by the Navy.\n\n== Constructed in Camden, New Jersey ==\n\n''Nahant'', a 405 gross ton harbor tug built in 1913 by [[John H. Dialogue]], [[Camden, New Jersey]], as ''Luckenbach No. 4'' was acquired by the Navy from Luckenbach Steamship Co., Inc., New York City, 1 December 1917. Renamed ''Nahant'' and given the registry number ''SP-1250'', she was placed in commission at the beginning of December 1917.\n\n== World War I service ==\n \nOperating in the [[3rd Naval District]], ''Nahant'' performed towing tasks in [[New York Harbor]] for the rest of World War I and into the early post-war era.\n\n==  On loan to the City of New York ==\n\nDecommissioning early in 1920, ''Nahant'' was transferred to the City of New York and served the Police Department as ''Service No. 3'' and as ''John F. Harlan''.\n\n== Final disposition ==\n\nReturned to the Navy in 1928, ''Nahant'' was struck from the [[Naval Register]] 27 September 1928 and sold to Joseph O\u2019Boyle of New York City 24 December 1928. Subsequently, she enjoyed a lengthy maritime history, changing her name a few times as: ''Gotham'', ''W. E. Hunt'', and ''Good Fortune''. She was finally scrapped in 1962.\n\n== References ==\n* {{DANFS|http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/n1/nahant-ii.htm}}\n* [http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/sh-civil/civsh-l/luckbch4.htm Luckenbach Number 4 (Tug, 1913).

Pioneer Oil of Lawrenceville, IL, began drilling for oil at 10th and Chestnut streets on the Indiana State University campus in late December 2013, the first oil well drilled in downtown Terre Haute since 1903.<ref>Arthur Foulkes, [http://www.tribstar.com/news/local_news/sculpture-for-indiana-state-song-dedicated-by-wabash-river/article_56e2bc49-976e-57ef-b587-8872c73665bc.html \"Drilling for oil at ISU: Derrick appears on campus,\"] Terre Haute Tribune Star, December 16, 2013.</ref> \n\nTerre Haute is at the intersection of two major roadways: [[US 40 (IN)|U.S. 40]] from California to [[Maryland]] and [[US 41 (IN)|US 41]] from [[Copper Harbor, Michigan]] to Miami, Florida.

Black]] Laboratory of Archaeology website.</ref>\n\nThe construction of [[Siege of Fort Harrison|Fort Harrison]] in 1811 marked the known beginning of a permanent population of [[European-American]]s. A [[Wea]] Indian village already existed near the fort, and the orchards and meadows they kept a few miles south of the fort became the site of the present-day city. (Terre Haute's currently affiliated [[Order of the Arrow]] lodge of the [[Boy Scouts of America]] is named after the last leader of the Wea village, Jacco Godfroy.) The village of Terre Haute, then a part of [[Knox County, Indiana]], was platted in 1816.\n\nTerre Haute became the county seat of newly formed [[Vigo County]] in 1818, leading to increased population growth. The village's 1,000 residents voted to incorporate in 1832; the village was elevated to city status in 1853.\n\nEarly Terre Haute was a center of farming, milling, and pork processing. However, the business and industrial expansion of the city prior to 1860 developed largely thanks to transportation. The Wabash River, the building of the [[National Road]] (now [[US 40 (IN)|US 40]]) and the [[Wabash and Erie Canal]] linked Terre Haute to the world and broadened the city's range of influence. The economy was based on iron and steel mills, hominy plants and, late in the 19th century, distilleries, breweries and bottle makers. Coal mines and coal operating companies developed to support the railroads, yet agriculture remained predominant, largely due to the role of corn in making alcoholic beverages and food items.\n\nWith steady growth and development in the later part of the 19th century, the vibrant neighborhoods of the city benefited from improved fire protection, the founding of two hospitals, dozens of churches and a number of outlets for amusement. Terre Haute's position as an educational hub was fostered as several institutions of higher education were established. The city developed a reputation for its arts and entertainment offerings. Grand opera houses were built that hosted hundreds of operas and theatrical performances. It became a stop on the popular vaudeville circuit. The development of the streetcar system and later the electric-powered trolleys in the 1890s made it possible for residents to travel with ease to baseball games, picnics, river excursions, amusement parks, and even horse racing. The famous \"Four-Cornered\" Racetrack, now the site of [[Memorial Stadium (Terre Haute)|Memorial Stadium]], was laid out in 1886 and drew the best of the country's trotters and drivers.\n\nOn the evening of Easter Sunday, March 23, 1913, a major tornado struck Terre Haute at approximately 9:45&nbsp;p.m.,<ref>{{cite journal | author=Eloise Batic and Angela Giacomelli | title = Wulf\u2019s Hall: Great Hope in the Midst of the Great Flood | journal = Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History | volume =25 | issue =2 | page =6 | publisher = Indiana Historical Society | location = Indianapolis | date =Spring 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |year=2013 |title=The Great Flood of 1913, 100 Years Later: Other Weather Events in 1913 |publisher=Silver Jackets  |url=http://mrcc.isws.illinois.edu/1913Flood/storms_wx/other_wx.shtml# |accessdate=2013-07-29}}</ref> demolishing more than 300 homes, killing 21 people and injuring 250.<ref>{{cite web |title=Indiana: Tornadoes causing 10 or more deaths |publisher=The Tornado Project |url=http://www.tornadoproject.com/alltorns/worstts.htm#IN |accessdate=2013-07-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035740/http://www.tornadoproject.com/alltorns/worstts.htm |archivedate=March 4, 2016}}</ref> Damage to local businesses and industries was estimated at $1 million to $2 million (in 1913 dollars).

A special train of eight coaches brought Klan members from [[Indianapolis]], another came from [[Evansville, Indiana|Evansville]] and [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]], and another brought 1,000 Klansmen from [[Muncie, Indiana|Muncie]]. It was reported that Klansmen from throughout Indiana and many surrounding states attended, with an estimated crowd of 75,000. Proceeds from the rally were used to build a $100,000 Klan home just north of Terre Haute. At 9:00&nbsp;p.m. 5,000 robed Klansmen paraded through the city. On their return to the park six {{convert|30|ft|adj=on}} tall crosses were burned. Fifteen hundred candidates were initiated into the Klan and 500 women joined the auxiliary.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6986808/large_klan_rally_in_terre_haute/|title=Klansmen at Terre Haute|work=Indianapolis News|date=June 18, 1923|page=8|accessdate=October 11, 2016|via=newspapers.com}}</ref>\n\nLike all U.S. communities, Terre Haute experienced economic swings as the country's economic base evolved. Before the [[Great Depression]] brought the U.S. economy to a halt, outside influences such as Prohibition and the decline of the country's railroads had a negative effect on two of Terre Haute's major industries - distilleries/breweries and railroad repair works. However, in 1940 it was selected for a new United States penitentiary built on {{convert|1126|acre}} south of the city.\n\n[[World War II]] brought an economic upswing with the development of three ordnance plants in the county and the revitalization of the coal, railroad and agriculture industries. Terre Haute remained dependent on consumer manufacturers such as Quaker Maid, the world's largest food processing factory under one roof. The city was an enthusiastic participant in the war effort with troop send-offs, victory gardens, bond sales, civil defense drills, parades, and ceremonies. 1943 saw the opening of the country's 100th [[United Service Organizations]] (USO) facility in Terre Haute.\n\nFollowing the war, Terre Haute gained several new factories: [[Pfizer]] Chemical (1948), [[Allis-Chalmers]] (1951), [[Columbia Records]] (1954), and Anaconda Aluminum (1959). The face of downtown Terre Haute began to change in the late 1960s when [[Interstate 70 in Indiana|Interstate 70]] was built, passing through Vigo County about five miles south of the path of U.S. 40 (downtown's Wabash Ave. at the time). As traffic began to concentrate at the [[U.S. Route 41 in Indiana|U.S. 41]] interchange, many downtown businesses relocated to [[Honey Creek Mall]] shopping center, built in 1968.\n\nThroughout the period, civic groups developed to work toward boosting the economy. The Terre Haute Committee for Area Progress developed the Fort Harrison Industrial Park in the 1970s. Grow Terre Haute in the mid-1980s encouraged the establishment of new stores, factories, and high-tech industrial parks that helped to stabilize the economy and enhance community life. Most encouraging were the arrival of the Digital Audio Disc Corporation ([[DADC]]), a subsidiary of the global company, [[Sony]], as the first American factory designed exclusively to make compact discs. In other developments over these years, railroad overpasses eased traffic congestion, law enforcement strengthened, and several national and state awards for volunteerism and citizen participation boosted local pride.\n\nLike other Midwest manufacturing cities, Terre Haute faced daunting challenges as it neared the end of the 20th century. Outmigration of the population and the closure of long-time manufacturing operations were economic challenges that community leaders met with a combination of hard work and ingenuity.\n\n[[Image:TerreHaute-Downtown-lookingeast.jpg|left|thumb|Downtown Terre Haute.]]\nMuch of the city's resiliency can be attributed to the diversity of the local economy. Manufacturing continues to be an important part of that, thanks to the formation of the Vigo County Industrial Park over 20 years ago. The efforts of the Terre Haute Economic Development Corporation, in cooperation with city and county government, have made the Industrial Park home to some of the world's leading companies \u2013 [[Companhia Sider\u00fargica Nacional]]\u2019s (CSN\u2019s) cold-roll steel processing facility, [[Staples Inc.|Staples Corporation]]\u2019s Midwest Distribution Center, [[Advics]] automotive brake systems manufacturing facility and [[ThyssenKrupp]] Presta\u2019s automotive steering systems manufacturing facility and [[CertainTeed]]\u2019s fiber cement board manufacturing plant.\n\nThe revitalization of the downtown area can be traced to the construction of [[First Financial Bank]]\u2019s new headquarters building in the late 1980s and creation of the city's first [[tax increment financing]] (TIF) district, which funded the first downtown parking structure. Over the years, more initiatives followed, including construction of several new office buildings and a second downtown parking structure.\n\nWith the efforts of nonprofit groups such as Downtown Terre Haute and the expansion of the campus of [[Indiana State University]], changes have spurred growth downtown. Several new hotels and businesses have been added to the \"Crossroads of America\" near 7th & Wabash, outdoor events and festivals attract crowds nearly every weekend during the summer months and the 7th Street Arts Corridor and Terre Haute Children's Museum, completed in 2010, enhance the appeal of the downtown area. It was these developments over several years that inspired property owners throughout downtown to rehab and renovate their buildings, including [[Hulman & Company]] and many individual owners.  A new $25 million convention center is in the works for downtown Terre Haute, with completion planned for 2021<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indianaconstructionnews.com/2019/09/06/25-million-terre-haute-convention-center-breaks-ground/|title=$25 million Terre Haute Convention Center breaks ground {{!}} Indiana Construction News|last=MarkBuckshon|website=www.indianaconstructionnews.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-29}}</ref>\n\nRenovation of the city's 1930s-era Federal Building to house Indiana State University's Scott College of Business in 2010 <ref>Loughlin, Sue.

The village of Terre Haute, then a part of [[Knox County, Indiana]], was platted in 1816.\n\nTerre Haute became the county seat of newly formed [[Vigo County]] in 1818, leading to increased population growth. The village's 1,000 residents voted to incorporate in 1832; the village was elevated to city status in 1853.\n\nEarly Terre Haute was a center of farming, milling, and pork processing. However, the business and industrial expansion of the city prior to 1860 developed largely thanks to transportation. The Wabash River, the building of the [[National Road]] (now [[US 40 (IN)|US 40]]) and the [[Wabash and Erie Canal]] linked Terre Haute to the world and broadened the city's range of influence. The economy was based on iron and steel mills, hominy plants and, late in the 19th century, distilleries, breweries and bottle makers. Coal mines and coal operating companies developed to support the railroads, yet agriculture remained predominant, largely due to the role of corn in making alcoholic beverages and food items.\n\nWith steady growth and development in the later part of the 19th Century, the vibrant neighborhoods of the city benefited from improved fire protection, the founding of two hospitals, dozens of churches and a number of outlets for amusement. Terre Haute's position as an educational hub was fostered as several institutions of higher education were established. The city developed a reputation for its arts and entertainment offerings. Grand opera houses were built that hosted hundreds of operas and theatrical performances. It became a stop on the popular vaudeville circuit. The development of the streetcar system and later the electric-powered trolleys in the 1890s made it possible for residents to travel with ease to baseball games, picnics, river excursions, amusement parks, and even horse racing. The famous \"Four-Cornered\" Racetrack, now the site of [[Memorial Stadium (Terre Haute)|Memorial Stadium]], was laid out in 1886 and drew the best of the country's trotters and drivers.\n\nOn the evening of Easter Sunday, March 23, 1913, a major tornado struck Terre Haute at approximately 9:45&nbsp;p.m.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Eloise Batic and Angela Giacomelli | title = Wulf\u2019s Hall: Great Hope in the Midst of the Great Flood | journal = Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History | volume =25 | issue =2 | page =6 | publisher = Indiana Historical Society | location = Indianapolis | date =Spring 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |year=2013 |title=The Great Flood of 1913, 100 Years Later: Other Weather Events in 1913 |publisher=Silver Jackets  |url=http://mrcc.isws.illinois.edu/1913Flood/storms_wx/other_wx.shtml# |accessdate=2013-07-29}}</ref> It demolished more than 300 homes, killed twenty-one people and injured 250.<ref>{{cite web |title=Indiana: Tornadoes causing 10 or more deaths |publisher=The Tornado Project |url=http://www.tornadoproject.com/alltorns/worstts.htm#IN |accessdate=2013-07-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035740/http://www.tornadoproject.com/alltorns/worstts.htm |archivedate=March 4, 2016}}</ref> Damage to local businesses and industries was estimated at $1 million to $2 million (in 1913 dollars).

A special train of eight coaches brought Klan members from [[Indianapolis]], another came from [[Evansville, Indiana|Evansville]] and [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]], and another brought 1,000 Klansmen from [[Muncie, Indiana|Muncie]]. It was reported that Klansmen from throughout Indiana and many surrounding states attended, with an estimated crowd of 75,000. Proceeds from the rally were used to build a $100,000 Klan home just north of Terre Haute. At 9:00&nbsp;p.m. 5,000 robed Klansmen paraded through the city. On their return to the park six {{convert|30|ft|adj=on}} tall crosses were burned. Fifteen hundred candidates were initiated into the Klan and 500 women joined the auxiliary.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6986808/large_klan_rally_in_terre_haute/|title=Klansmen at Terre Haute|work=Indianapolis News|date=June 18, 1923|page=8|accessdate=October 11, 2016|via=newspapers.com}}</ref>\n\nLike all U.S. communities, Terre Haute experienced economic swings as the country's economic base evolved. Before the [[Great Depression]] brought the U.S. economy to a halt, outside influences such as Prohibition and the decline of the country's railroads had a negative effect on two of Terre Haute's major industries - distilleries/breweries and railroad repair works. However, in 1940 it was selected for a new United States penitentiary built on {{convert|1126|acre}} south of the city.\n\n[[World War II]] brought an economic upswing with the development of three ordnance plants in the county and the revitalization of the coal, railroad and agriculture industries. Terre Haute remained dependent on consumer manufacturers such as Quaker Maid, the world's largest food processing factory under one roof. The city was an enthusiastic participant in the war effort with troop send-offs, victory gardens, bond sales, civil defense drills, parades, and ceremonies. 1943 saw the opening of the country's 100th [[United Service Organizations]] (USO) facility in Terre Haute.\n\nFollowing the war, Terre Haute gained several new factories: [[Pfizer]] Chemical (1948), [[Allis-Chalmers]] (1951), [[Columbia Records]] (1954), and Anaconda Aluminum (1959). Yet, the face of downtown Terre Haute began to change in the late 1960s when [[Interstate 70 in Indiana|Interstate 70]] was built, passing through Vigo County about five miles south of the path of U.S. 40 (downtown's Wabash Ave. at the time). As traffic began to concentrate at the [[U.S. Route 41 in Indiana|U.S. 41]] interchange, many downtown businesses relocated to [[Honey Creek Mall]] shopping center, built in 1968.\n\nThroughout the period, civic groups developed to work toward boosting the economy. The Terre Haute Committee for Area Progress developed the Fort Harrison Industrial Park in the 1970s. Grow Terre Haute in the mid-1980s urged on the establishment of new stores, factories, and high-tech industrial parks that helped to stabilize the economy and enhance community life. Most encouraging were the arrival of the Digital Audio Disc Corporation ([[DADC]]), a subsidiary of the global company, [[Sony]], as the first American factory designed exclusively to make compact discs. In other developments over these years, railroad overpasses eased traffic congestion, law enforcement strengthened, and several national and state awards for volunteerism and citizen participation boosted local pride.\n\nLike other Midwest manufacturing cities, Terre Haute faced daunting challenges as it neared the end of the 20th century. Outmigration of the population and the closure of long-time manufacturing operations were economic challenges that community leaders met with a combination of hard work and ingenuity.\n\n[[Image:TerreHaute-Downtown-lookingeast.jpg|left|thumb|Downtown Terre Haute.]]\nMuch of the city's resiliency can be attributed to the diversity of the local economy. Manufacturing continues to be an important part of that, thanks to the formation of the Vigo County Industrial Park over 20 years ago. The efforts of the Terre Haute Economic Development Corporation, in cooperation with city and county government, have made the Industrial Park home to some of the world's leading companies \u2013 [[Companhia Sider\u00fargica Nacional]]\u2019s (CSN\u2019s) cold-roll steel processing facility, [[Staples Inc.|Staples Corporation]]\u2019s Midwest Distribution Center, [[Advics]] automotive brake systems manufacturing facility and [[ThyssenKrupp]] Presta\u2019s automotive steering systems manufacturing facility and [[CertainTeed]]\u2019s fiber cement board manufacturing plant.\n\nThe revitalization of the downtown area can be traced to the construction of [[First Financial Bank]]\u2019s new headquarters building in the late 1980s and creation of the city's first [[tax increment financing]] (TIF) district, which funded the first downtown parking structure. Over the years, more initiatives followed, including construction of several new office buildings and a second downtown parking structure.\n\nWith the efforts of nonprofit groups such as Downtown Terre Haute and the expansion of the campus of [[Indiana State University]], many positive changes have once again spurred growth downtown. Several new hotels and businesses have been added to the \"Crossroads of America\" near 7th & Wabash, outdoor events and festivals attract crowds nearly every weekend during the summer months and the 7th Street Arts Corridor and Terre Haute Children's Museum, completed in 2010, enhance the appeal of the downtown area. It was these developments over several years that inspired property owners throughout downtown to rehab and renovate their buildings, including [[Hulman & Company]] and many individual owners.\n\nRenovation of the city's 1930s-era Federal Building to house Indiana State University's Scott College of Business in 2010 <ref>Loughlin, Sue.
