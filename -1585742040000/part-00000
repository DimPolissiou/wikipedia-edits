Tricked into marriage by his convincing mother-in-law, what really irks Bharathi is his wife's inability to deal with his rabid female fans. Tensions escalate until Bharathi flees from home and ends up encountering someone else named Jyothi ([[Sithara (actress)|Sithara]]) who's also escaping from her life as a dancer because her husband made her dance forcefully and tried forcing her to be a prostitute. Then, he makes a living in [[Goa]] with Jyothi.\n\nThen Bharathi get a prank call from his PA that Gowri is ill. So he comes back with Jyothi from Goa, which makes Gowri angry and she doesn't let Jyothi in without knowing who she is. Bharathi gets angry and they stay in another one of his houses. Bharathi gets so angry that he claims that he loves Jyothi and that she cannot go because of her problems. So Gowri files for a divorce and informs news reporters about Jyothi. Jyothi's husband appears later in the story. Gowri plans to marry a cricket player Guru. Guru had proposed to her in the past. He accepts the proposal and abandons one of his fans, Yamuna, who is obsessed with him. Later, Yamuna commits suicide in the marriage hall readied for Gowri's marriage. Gowri's mother and her PA feel that she is mentally unstable. Her mother begs Bharathi to go and see her in the hospital and he goes with Jyothi to see her. Jyothi then sees that Bharathi and Gowri belong to each other. Jyothi later finds her husband, who was indeed in love with her. After that, Bharathi goes to recording with him being happy and visits his wife in the hospital.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Rashin Rahman|Rahman]] as Manibharathi<ref name=\"thread\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.thehindu.com/thread/reflections/tamil-films-are-getting-more-modern-and-more-misogynistic/article19209779.ece |title=Tamil films are getting more modern, and more misogynistic |last=Surendran |first=Anusha |last2=Venkatraman |first2=Janane |date=4 July 2017 |website=[[The Hindu]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180227170207/http://www.thehindu.com/thread/reflections/tamil-films-are-getting-more-modern-and-more-misogynistic/article19209779.ece |archive-date=27 February 2018 |access-date=27 February 2018}}</ref>\n*[[Geetha (actress)|Geetha]] as Gowri<ref name=\"thread\" />\n*[[Sithara (actress)|Sithara]] as Jyothi<ref name=\"thread\" />\n*[[Jayachitra]] as Kanchanamala\n*[[Janagaraj]] as Jolly\n*[[Vivek (actor)|Vivek]] as Vittal Manibharathi's personal assistant\n*[[Chi.

Balachander]]. It stars [[Rahman (actor)|Rahman]], [[Sithara (actress)|Sithara]], [[Geetha (actress)|Geetha]], [[Janagaraj]], [[Jayachitra]], [[Poornam Vishwanathan]], [[Sowcar Janaki]], [[Vivek (actor)|Vivek]] and [[Ilaiyaraaja]].\n\n== Plot ==\nBharathi (Rahman) is a famous singer who lives with his extremely possessive wife Gowri (Geetha). Tricked into marriage by his convincing mother-in-law, what really irks Bharathi is his wife's inability to deal with his rabid female fans. Tensions escalate until Bharathi flees from home and ends up encountering someone else named Jyothi ([[Sithara (actress)|Sithara]]) who's also escaping from her life as a dancer because her husband made her dance forcefully and tried forcing her to be a prostitute. Then, he makes a living in [[Goa]] with Jyothi.\n\nThen Bharathi get a prank call from his PA that Gowri is ill. So he comes back with Jyothi from Goa, which makes Gowri angry and she doesn't let Jyothi in without knowing who she is. Bharathi gets angry and they stay in another one of his houses. Bharathi gets so angry that he claims that he loves Jyothi and that she cannot go because of her problems. So Gowri files for a divorce and informs news reporters about Jyothi. Jyothi's husband appears later in the story. Gowri plans to get married to a cricket player Guru. Guru had proposed to her in the past. He accepts the proposal and abandons one of his fans, Yamuna, who is obsessed with him. Later, Yamuna commits suicide in the marriage hall readied for Gowri's marriage. Gowri's mother and her PA feel that she is mentally unstable. Her mother begs Bharathi to go and see her in the hospital and he goes with Jyothi to see her. Jyothi then sees that Bharathi and Gowri belong to each other. Jyothi later finds her husband, who was indeed in love with her. After that, Bharathi goes to recording with him being happy and visits his wife in the hospital.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Rashin Rahman|Rahman]] as Manibharathi<ref name=\"thread\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.thehindu.com/thread/reflections/tamil-films-are-getting-more-modern-and-more-misogynistic/article19209779.ece |title=Tamil films are getting more modern, and more misogynistic |last=Surendran |first=Anusha |last2=Venkatraman |first2=Janane |date=4 July 2017 |website=[[The Hindu]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180227170207/http://www.thehindu.com/thread/reflections/tamil-films-are-getting-more-modern-and-more-misogynistic/article19209779.ece |archive-date=27 February 2018 |access-date=27 February 2018}}</ref>\n*[[Geetha (actress)|Geetha]] as Gowri<ref name=\"thread\" />\n*[[Sithara (actress)|Sithara]] as Jyothi<ref name=\"thread\" />\n*[[Jayachitra]] as Kanchanamala\n* [[Janagaraj]] as Jolly\n*[[Vivek (actor)|Vivek]] as Vittal Manibharathi's personal assistant\n*[[Chi.
