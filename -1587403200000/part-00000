For this reason, it may be as helpful to consider the differences between descriptions of open educational resources as it is to consider the descriptions themselves. One of several tensions in reaching a consensus description of OER (as found in the above definitions) is whether there should be explicit emphasis placed on specific [[technology|technologies]]. For example, a [[video]] can be openly licensed and freely used without being a ''streaming'' video. A [[book]] can be openly licensed and freely used without being an ''electronic'' document. This technologically driven tension is deeply bound up with the discourse of [[Open-source license|open-source licensing]]. For more, see [[#Licensing and Types of OER|Licensing and Types of OER]] later in this article.\n\nThere is also a tension between entities which find value in quantifying usage of OER and those which see such [[Performance metric|metrics]] as themselves being irrelevant to free and open resources. Those requiring metrics associated with OER are often those with economic investment in the technologies needed to access or provide electronic OER, those with economic interests potentially threatened by OER,<ref>{{cite book|last=(CERI)|first=Center for Educational Research and Innovation|title=Giving Knowledge for Free: The Emergence of Open Educational Resources|year=2007|publisher=Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD)|location=Executive Summary (Policy implications and recommendations)|isbn=978-92-64-03174-6|page=15|url=http://www.oecd.org/edu/ceri/38654317.pdf}}</ref> or those requiring justification for the costs of implementing and maintaining the infrastructure or access to the freely available OER.

Many educational resources made available on the Internet are geared to allowing online access to digitised educational content, but the materials themselves are restrictively licensed.  Thus, they are not OER.  Often, this is not intentional.  Most educators are not familiar with copyright law in their own jurisdictions, never mind internationally.  International law and national laws of nearly all nations, and certainly of those who have signed onto the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO), restrict all content under strict copyright (unless the copyright owner specifically releases it under an open license).

According to Wiley & Hilton (2018),<ref name=\"irrodl.org\"/> the two popular terms used are \"open pedagogy\" and \"open educational practices\". What these two terms refer to is closely related to each other, often indistinguishable. For example, Weller (2013) defines open pedagogy as follows: \"Open pedagogy makes use of this abundant, open content (such as open educational resources, videos, podcasts), but also places an emphasis on the network and the learner's connections within this\".<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.5334/2013-15|title = The Battle for Open - a perspective|journal = Journal of Interactive Media in Education|volume = 2013|issue = 3|pages = 15|year = 2013|last1 = Weller|first1 = Martin|doi-access = free}}</ref> Open educational practices are defined as, for example, \u201ca set of activities around instructional design and implementation of events and processes intended to support learning. They also include the creation, use and repurposing of Open Educational Resources (OER) and their adaptation to the contextual setting. (The Open Educational Quality Initiative<ref>https://duepublico.uni-duisburg-essen.de/servlets/DerivateServlet/Derivate-25907/OPALReport2011_Beyond_OER.pdf</ref>). Wiley & Hilton (2018)<ref name=\"irrodl.org\"/> proposed a new term called \"OER-enabled pedagogy\", which is defined as \"the set of teaching and learning practices that are only possible or practical in the context of the 5R permissions which are characteristic of OER\", emphasizing the 5R permissions enabled by the use of open licenses.\n\n== Costs ==\nOne of the most frequently cited benefits of OER is their potential to reduce costs.<ref>Bliss, T.

New OER can be assembled or simply reused or repurposed from existing open resources. This is a primary strength of OER and, as such, can produce major cost savings. OER need not be created from scratch. On the other hand, there are some costs in the assembly and adaptation process. And some OER must be created and produced originally at some time. While OER must be hosted and disseminated, and some require funding, OER development can take different routes, such as creation, adoption, adaptation and curation.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEach of these models provides different cost structure and degree of cost-efficiency. Upfront costs in developing the OER infrastructure can be expensive, such as building the OER infrastructure. Butcher and Hoosen<ref>Butcher, N., & Hoosen, S. (2012).

For this reason, it may be as helpful to consider the differences between descriptions of open educational resources as it is to consider the descriptions themselves. One of several tensions in reaching a consensus description of OER (as found in the above definitions) is whether there should be explicit emphasis placed on specific [[technology|technologies]]. For example, a [[video]] can be openly licensed and freely used without being a ''streaming'' video. A [[book]] can be openly licensed and freely used without being an ''electronic'' document. This technologically driven tension is deeply bound up with the discourse of [[Open-source license|open-source licensing]]. For more, see [[#Licensing and Types of OER|Licensing and Types of OER]] later in this article.\n\nThere is also a tension between entities which find value in quantifying usage of OER and those which see such [[Performance metric|metrics]] as themselves being irrelevant to free and open resources.

Many educational resources made available on the Internet are geared to allowing online access to digitised educational content, but the materials themselves are restrictively licensed.  Thus, they are not OER.  Often, this is not intentional.  Most educators are not familiar with copyright law in their own jurisdictions, never mind internationally.  International law and national laws of nearly all nations, and certainly of those who have signed onto the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO), restrict all content under strict copyright (unless the copyright owner specifically releases it under an open license).

According to Wiley & Hilton (2018),<ref name=\"irrodl.org\"/> the two popular terms used are \"open pedagogy\" and \"open educational practices\". What these two terms refer to is closely related to each other, often indistinguishable. For example, Weller (2013) defines open pedagogy as follows: \"Open pedagogy makes use of this abundant, open content (such as open educational resources, videos, podcasts), but also places an emphasis on the network and the learner's connections within this\".<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.5334/2013-15|title = The Battle for Open - a perspective|journal = Journal of Interactive Media in Education|volume = 2013|issue = 3|pages = 15|year = 2013|last1 = Weller|first1 = Martin|doi-access = free}}</ref> Open educational practices are defined as, for example, \u201ca set of activities around instructional design and implementation of events and processes intended to support learning. They also include the creation, use and repurposing of Open Educational Resources (OER) and their adaptation to the contextual setting. (The Open Educational Quality Initiative<ref>https://duepublico.uni-duisburg-essen.de/servlets/DerivateServlet/Derivate-25907/OPALReport2011_Beyond_OER.pdf</ref>). Wiley & Hilton (2018)<ref name=\"irrodl.org\"/> proposed a new term called \"OER-enabled pedagogy\", which is defined as \"the set of teaching and learning practices that are only possible or practical in the context of the 5R permissions which are characteristic of OER\", emphasizing the 5R permissions enabled by the use of open licenses.\n\n== Costs ==\nOne of the most frequently cited benefits of OER is their potential to reduce costs.<ref>Bliss, T.

New OER can be assembled or simply reused or repurposed from existing open resources. This is a primary strength of OER and, as such, can produce major cost savings. OER need not be created from scratch. On the other hand, there are some costs in the assembly and adaptation process. And some OER must be created and produced originally at some time. While OER must be hosted and disseminated, and some require funding, OER development can take different routes, such as creation, adoption, adaptation and curation.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEach of these models provides different cost structure and degree of cost-efficiency.
