For example, [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] is defined as being on \"the fourth Thursday in November\". Some such definitions are more complex. For example, [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]] is defined as \"the Tuesday next after the first Monday in the month of November\" or \"the first Tuesday after November 1\".<ref name=\"ElecDay\">Statutes at Large, 28th Congress, 2nd Session, [http://memory.loc.gov/ll/llsl/005/0700/07590721.tif p. 721].</ref> Calendars mostly show Sunday as the first day of the week.\n\n==Time==\n{{see also|Time in the United States}}\nWhile most countries use the [[24-hour clock]], the United States differs in that it uses the [[12-hour clock]] almost exclusively, not only in spoken language, but also in writing, even on timetables, for airline tickets, and computer software. The suffixes \"a.m.\" and \"p.m.\" (often represented as AM and PM) are appended universally in written language. Alternatively, people might specify \"noon\" or \"midnight\", after or instead of 12:00. (Business events, which are increasingly scheduled using groupware calendar applications, are less vulnerable to such ambiguity, since the software itself can be modified to take care of the naming conventions.) Where the a.m.\u2013p.m. convention is inconvenient typographically (e.g., in dense tables), different fonts or colors are sometimes used instead. The most common usage in transport timetables for air, rail, bus, etc. is to use lightface for a.m. times and boldface for p.m. times. It is also not uncommon for AM and PM to be shortened to A and P. \n\n===24-hour usage===\nThe 24-hour clock is used in military and scientific contexts in the United States.<ref name=\"CMoS9.39\">{{Cite book| edition = 17| publisher = The University of Chicago Press| isbn = 978-0-226-28705-8| title = The Chicago Manual of Style| location = Chicago| date = 2017| chapterurl = http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/book/ed17/part2/ch09/psec039.html| chapter = 9.39: The twenty-four-hour system}}</ref> It is best known for its use by the military, and therefore commonly called \"[[military time]]\". In U.S. military use, 24-hour time is traditionally written without a colon (1800 instead of 18:00) and in spoken language in the Army, but not the Navy or Marine Corps, is followed by the word \"hours\" (e.g., \"eighteen hundred hours\").\n\nThe 24-hour notation is also widely used by [[astronomer]]s, hospitals, various forms of transportation, and at radio and other broadcast media outlets behind the scenes where scheduling programming needs to be exact, without mistaking AM and PM. In these cases, exact and unambiguous communication of time is critical. If someone mistakes 5:00 AM for 5:00 PM in a hospital for example, when medication or other medical treatment is needed at a certain time, the outcome could be critical. Thus 24-hour time (5:00 PM written as 17:00) is used.\n\n===Characteristics===\nSome style guides and most people suggest not to use a leading zero with a single-digit hour; for example, \"3:52 p.m.\" is preferred over \"03:52 p.m.\".  (The leading zero is more commonly used with the 24-hour notation; especially in computer applications because it can help to maintain column alignment in tables and correct sorting order, and also because it helps to highlight the 24-hour character of the given time.)\n\nTimes of day ending in '':00'' minutes may be pronounced as the numbered hour followed by ''o'clock'' (e.g., 10:00 ''ten o'clock,'' 2:00 ''two o'clock,'' 4:00 ''four o'clock'', etc.). This may be followed by the ''a.m.'' or ''p.m.'' designator, or might not be, if obvious. ''O'clock'' itself may be omitted, leaving a time such as ''four a.m.'' or ''four p.m.'' Instead of \"a.m.\" and \"p.m.\", times can also be described as \"in the morning\", \"in the afternoon\", \"in the evening\", or \"at night\".\n\nThe minutes (other than '':00'') may be pronounced in a variety of ways:\n\nMinutes :01 through :09 are usually pronounced as ''oh one'' through ''oh nine''. :10 through :59 are their usual number-words. For example, \"9:45 a.m.\" is usually pronounced \"nine forty-five\" or sometimes \"nine forty-five a.m.\".\n\nTimes of day from '':01'' to '':29'' minutes past the hour are commonly pronounced with the words \"after\" or \"past\", for example, 10:17 being \"seventeen after ten\" or \"seventeen past ten\". '':15'' minutes is very commonly called \"quarter after\" or \"quarter past\" and '':30'' minutes universally \"half past\", e.g., 4:30, \"half past four\". Times of day from '':31'' to '':59'' are, by contrast, given subtractively with the words \"to\", \"of\", \"until\", or \"till\": 12:55 would be pronounced as \"five to one\" or \"five of one\".\n\n'':45'' minutes is pronounced as \"quarter to\", \"quarter of\", \"quarter until\", or \"quarter till\". For example, \"9:45 a.m.\" is often pronounced \"fifteen till ten\" or \"quarter to ten\", or sometimes \"quarter to ten in the morning\" (but rarely \"quarter to ten a.m.\").\n\nHowever, it is always acceptable to pronounce the time using number words and the aforementioned \"oh\" convention, for example, 12:55 \"twelve fifty-five\", 12:09 \"twelve oh-nine\", 12:30 \"twelve thirty\", and 12:15 \"twelve fifteen\". {{Citation needed span|text=This pronunciation is becoming more common.|date=January 2019|reason=}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|United States}}\n* [[Date format by country]]\n* [[ISO 8601]]\n{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Americas topic|Date and time notation in|state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:Date and time representation by country|United States]]\n[[Category:Time in the United States|Notation]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox\n | title   = Date and time notation in the United States\n |  label2 = Full date         | data2 = {{time|df=mdy|EST|dateonly=yes|hide-refresh=yes|hide-tz=yes}}<br />{{time|df=dmy|dateonly=yes|hide-refresh=yes|hide-tz=yes}}\n |  label3 = All-numeric date  | data3 = {{#time: m/d/Y}}<br />{{time|EST|df=iso|dateonly=yes|hide-refresh=yes|hide-tz=yes}}\n |  label4 = Time (Eastern)    | data4 = {{time|df=12|EST|timeonly=yes|hide-refresh=yes|hide-tz=yes}}<br />{{time|EST|df=24|timeonly=yes|hide-tz=yes}}\n\n}}\n\n'''Date and time notation in the United States''' differs from that used in nearly all other countries.

Thus 24-hour time (5:00 PM written as 17:00) is used.\n\n===Characteristics===\nSome style guides and most people suggest not to use a leading zero with a single-digit hour; for example, \"3:52 p.m.\" is preferred over \"03:52 p.m.\".  (The leading zero is more commonly used with the 24-hour notation; especially in computer applications because it can help to maintain column alignment in tables and correct sorting order, and also because it helps to highlight the 24-hour character of the given time.)\n\nTimes of day ending in '':00'' minutes may be pronounced as the numbered hour followed by ''o'clock'' (e.g., 10:00 ''ten o'clock,'' 2:00 ''two o'clock,'' 4:00 ''four o'clock'', etc.). This may be followed by the ''a.m.'' or ''p.m.'' designator, or might not be, if obvious. ''O'clock'' itself may be omitted, leaving a time such as ''four a.m.'' or ''four p.m.'' Instead of \"a.m.\" and \"p.m.\", times can also be described as \"in the morning\", \"in the afternoon\", \"in the evening\", or \"at night\".\n\nThe minutes (other than '':00'') may be pronounced in a variety of ways:\n\nMinutes :01 through :09 are usually pronounced as ''oh one'' through ''oh nine''. :10 through :59 are their usual number-words. For example, \"9:45 a.m.\" is usually pronounced \"nine forty-five\" or sometimes \"nine forty-five a.m.\".\n\nTimes of day from '':01'' to '':29'' minutes past the hour are commonly pronounced with the words \"after\" or \"past\", for example, 10:17 being \"seventeen after ten\" or \"seventeen past ten\". '':15'' minutes is very commonly called \"quarter after\" or \"quarter past\" and '':30'' minutes universally \"half past\", e.g., 4:30, \"half past four\". Times of day from '':31'' to '':59'' are, by contrast, given subtractively with the words \"to\", \"of\", \"until\", or \"till\": 12:55 would be pronounced as \"five to one\" or \"five of one\".\n\n'':45'' minutes is pronounced as \"quarter to\", \"quarter of\", \"quarter until\", or \"quarter till\". For example, \"9:45 a.m.\" is often pronounced \"fifteen till ten\" or \"quarter to ten\", or sometimes \"quarter to ten in the morning\" (but rarely \"quarter to ten a.m.\").\n\nHowever, it is always acceptable to pronounce the time using number words and the aforementioned \"oh\" convention, for example, 12:55 \"twelve fifty-five\", 12:09 \"twelve oh-nine\", 12:30 \"twelve thirty\", and 12:15 \"twelve fifteen\". {{Citation needed span|text=This pronunciation is becoming more common.|date=January 2019|reason=}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|United States}}\n* [[Date format by country]]\n* [[ISO 8601]]\n{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Americas topic|Date and time notation in|state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:Date and time representation by country|United States]]\n[[Category:Time in the United States|Notation]]\n", "name_user": "107.134.86.17", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eDate)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_and_time_notation_in_the_United_States"}
