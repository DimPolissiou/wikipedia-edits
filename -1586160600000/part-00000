It was the second to enter in regular service, behind the British [[de Havilland Comet]], and was the only [[jet airliner|jetliner]] operating in the world from 1956 to 1958, when the British jetliner was grounded due to safety matters.<ref name=\"Tu104\">{{cite web |url=http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/libro?codigo=237370|title=Reactores Comerciales (1999a) (en: Commercial Jetliners) | isbn = 84-95088-87-8 |work=Antonio L\u00f3pez Ortega |publisher=Agualarga Editores S.l. |accessdate=2008-09-26 |language=Spanish}}</ref>\n\nIn 1957, Czechoslovak Airlines&nbsp;\u2013 \u010cSA, (now [[Czech Airlines]]) became the first airline in the world to fly a route exclusively with jet airliners, using the Tu-104A variant between Prague and Moscow. In civil service, the Tu-104 carried over 90 million passengers with Aeroflot (then the world's largest airline), and a lesser number with \u010cSA, while it also saw operation with the [[Soviet Air Force]]. Its successors included the [[Tupolev Tu-124|Tu-124]], the [[Tupolev Tu-134|Tu-134]] and the [[Tupolev Tu-154|Tu-154]].\n\n==Design and development==\nAt the beginning of the 1950s, the Soviet Union's Aeroflot airline needed a modern airliner with better capacity and performance than the piston-engined aircraft then in operation. The design request was filled by the Tupolev OKB, which based their new airliner on its [[Tupolev Tu-16|Tu-16 'Badger']] strategic bomber. The wings, engines, and tail surfaces of the Tu-16 were retained with the airliner, but the new design adopted a wider, pressurised fuselage designed to accommodate 50 passengers.  The prototype build in MMZ 'Opit' first flew on June 17, 1955 with Yu.L. Alasheyev at the controls. It was fitted with a [[drag parachute]] to shorten the landing distance by up to {{convert|400|m|ft}}, since at the time not many airports had sufficiently long runways.<ref name=Tu104/>\n\nAlthough a popular story says Westerners were surprised by the arrival of the Tu-104 in [[London]] during a 1956 state visit{{dubious|Flight 1956 p372 reports Gen Serov arriving March, Krushchev arrives April|date=November 2015}} by [[Nikolai Bulganin]] and [[Nikita Khrushchev]], the airplane had already been revealed at the July 1955 [[Tushino Airfield|Tushino]] airshow.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP61S00137A000100070006-7.pdf Analysis of Camel/Tu-104], Central Intelligence Agency, August 3, 1957.</ref>\n\nThe Tu-104 was powered by two [[Mikulin AM-3]] turbojets placed in the wing roots (resembling the configuration of the [[de Havilland Comet]]). The crew consisted of five people: two pilots, a navigator (seated in the glazed \"bomber\" nose), a flight engineer and a radio operator (later eliminated). The airplane raised great curiosity by its lavish \"Victorian\" interior&nbsp;\u2013 so-called by some Western-hemisphere observers&nbsp;\u2013 due to the materials used: [[mahogany]], [[copper]] and [[lace]].<ref name=Tu104/>\n\nTu-104 pilots were trained on the [[Ilyushin Il-28|Il-28]] bomber, followed by mail flights on an unarmed Tu-16 bomber painted in Aeroflot colors, between [[Moscow]] and [[Yekaterinburg|Sverdlovsk]]. Pilots with previous Tu-16 experience transitioned into the Tu-104 with relative ease. The Tu-104 was considered difficult to fly, as it was heavy on controls and quite fast on final approach, and at low speeds it would display a tendency to stall, a feature common with highly-swept wings.\nExperience with the Tu-104 led the Tupolev Design Bureau to develop the world's first turbofan series-built airliner, the [[Tupolev Tu-124]], designed for local markets, and subsequently the more commercially successful [[Tupolev Tu-134|Tu-134]].\n\n==Operational history==\n[[File:Tupolev TU-104A Czech Airlines (CSA), LKKB Kbely, Czech Republic PP1185955612.jpg|thumb|Czechoslovak Airlines Tu-104A at [[Kbely Aviation Museum]], Prague]]\nOn 15 September 1956, the Tu-104 began revenue service on Aeroflot's [[Moscow]]-[[Omsk]]-[[Irkutsk]] route, replacing the [[Ilyushin Il-14]]. The flight time was reduced from 13 hours and 50 minutes to 7 hours and 40 minutes, and the new jet dramatically increased the level of passenger comfort.<ref name=Tu104/> By 1957, Aeroflot had placed the Tu-104 in service on routes from [[Vnukovo Airport]] in Moscow to [[London]], [[Budapest]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Beijing]], [[Brussels]], [[Ottawa]], [[Delhi]], and [[Prague]].\n\nIn 1957, [[Czech Airlines|\u010cSA Czechoslovak Airlines]] became the only export customer for the Tu-104, placing the aircraft on routes to [[Moscow]], [[Paris]], and [[Brussels]]. \u010cSA bought six Tu-104As (four new and two used examples) configured for 81 passengers. Three of these aircraft were subsequently written off (one due to a refueling incident in India and another to a pilot error without fatalities).<ref name=Tu104/>\n\nIn 1959 a Tu-104 was leased to Sir Henry Lunn Ltd. ([[Lunn Poly]]) of London which used the aircraft to transport holiday-makers to Russia with a 4.5 hour flight time.\n\nWhilst the Tu-104 continued to be used by Aeroflot throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the safety record of the aircraft was poor, in comparison to other jet airliners of its day (16 out of 96 aircraft were lost in crashes). The Tu-104 was unreliable, heavy, very unstable with poor control response, with an inclination to [[Dutch roll]]. Poor design aerodynamics of the wings resulted in a propensity to stall with little or no warning and a dangerous tendency to pitch-up violently before stalling and entering an irrecoverable dive. Due to the fear of inadvertent stalls aircrew would fly approaches above the recommended approach speed, landing at {{convert|270|-|300|km/h|abbr=on}}, nearly {{convert|50|km/h|abbr=on}} faster. At least 2 accidents were attributed to the pitch-up phenomenon, prompting changes to the design of the aircraft and operating procedures, but the problem remained. Aeroflot retired the Tu-104 from civil service in March 1979 following a fatal accident at Moscow, but several aircraft were transferred to the Soviet military, which used them as staff transports and to train [[cosmonaut]]s in [[Vomit Comet|zero gravity]]. After a military Tu-104 crash in February 1981 killed 52 people (17 were senior army and naval staff), the type was permanently removed from service. The last flight of the Tu-104 was a ferry flight to [[Ulyanovsk Aircraft Museum]] in 1986.\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:Tupolev Tu-104 near Vnukovo Airport - Moscow.JPG|thumb|right|A Tu-104 statue near [[Vnukovo Airport]]]]\n[[File:Tu104 Monino.jpg|thumb|\u0422u-104 preserved at [[Monino]] museum.

It used two Mikulin AM-3 turbojet engines, each with {{convert|6,735|kg}} of thrust. 29 airframes were built.\n* '''Tu-104 2NK-8''' \u2013 Proposed version powered by two [[Kuznetsov NK-8]] turbofan engines.\n* '''Tu-104A''' \u2013 Improved version appearing in June 1957; continued improvements of the Mikulin engines (Mikulin AM-3M each with {{convert|8,700|kg}} of thrust) permitted significant growth in capacity, resulting in a 70-seater variant. The Tu-104A became the definitive production variant. On 6 September 1957, it flew with 20 t of payload at {{convert|11,211|m}} of altitude. On 24 September 1957, it reached {{convert|970.8|km/h|abbr=on}} average speed with a two tonne payload.

It was the second to enter in regular service, behind the British [[de Havilland Comet]], and was the only [[jet airliner|jetliner]] operating in the world from 1956 to 1958, when the British jetliner was grounded due to safety matters.<ref name=\"Tu104\">{{cite web |url=http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/libro?codigo=237370|title=Reactores Comerciales (1999a) (en: Commercial Jetliners) | isbn = 84-95088-87-8 |work=Antonio L\u00f3pez Ortega |publisher=Agualarga Editores S.l. |accessdate=2008-09-26 |language=Spanish}}</ref>\n\nIn 1957, Czechoslovak Airlines&nbsp;\u2013 \u010cSA, (now [[Czech Airlines]]) became the first airline in the world to fly a route exclusively with jet airliners, using the Tu-104A variant between Prague and Moscow. In civil service, the Tu-104 carried over 90 million passengers with Aeroflot (then the world's largest airline), and a lesser number with \u010cSA, while it also saw operation with the [[Soviet Air Force]]. Its successors included the [[Tupolev Tu-124|Tu-124]], the [[Tupolev Tu-134|Tu-134]] and the [[Tupolev Tu-154|Tu-154]].\n\n==Design and development==\nAt the beginning of the 1950s, the Soviet Union's Aeroflot airline needed a modern airliner with better capacity and performance than the piston-engined aircraft then in operation. The design request was filled by the Tupolev OKB, which based their new airliner on its [[Tupolev Tu-16|Tu-16 'Badger']] strategic bomber. The wings, engines, and tail surfaces of the Tu-16 were retained with the airliner, but the new design adopted a wider, pressurised fuselage designed to accommodate 50 passengers.  The prototype build in MMZ 'Opit' first flew on June 17, 1955 with Yu.L. Alasheyev at the controls. It was fitted with a [[drag parachute]] to shorten the landing distance by up to {{convert|400|m|ft}}, since at the time not many airports had sufficiently long runways.<ref name=Tu104/>\n\nAlthough a popular story says Westerners were surprised by the arrival of the Tu-104 in [[London]] during a 1956 state visit{{dubious|Flight 1956 p372 reports Gen Serov arriving March, Krushchev arrives April|date=November 2015}} by [[Nikolai Bulganin]] and [[Nikita Khrushchev]], the airplane had already been revealed at the July 1955 [[Tushino Airfield|Tushino]] airshow.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP61S00137A000100070006-7.pdf Analysis of Camel/Tu-104], Central Intelligence Agency, August 3, 1957.</ref>\n\nThe Tu-104 was powered by two Mikulin AM-3 turbojets placed in the wing roots (resembling the configuration of the [[de Havilland Comet]]). The crew consisted of five people: two pilots, a navigator (seated in the glazed \"bomber\" nose), a flight engineer and a radio operator (later eliminated). The airplane raised great curiosity by its lavish \"Victorian\" interior&nbsp;\u2013 so-called by some Western-hemisphere observers&nbsp;\u2013 due to the materials used: [[mahogany]], [[copper]] and [[lace]].<ref name=Tu104/>\n\nTu-104 pilots were trained on the [[Ilyushin Il-28|Il-28]] bomber, followed by mail flights on an unarmed Tu-16 bomber painted in Aeroflot colors, between [[Moscow]] and [[Yekaterinburg|Sverdlovsk]]. Pilots with previous Tu-16 experience transitioned into the Tu-104 with relative ease. The Tu-104 was considered difficult to fly, as it was heavy on controls and quite fast on final approach, and at low speeds it would display a tendency to stall, a feature common with highly-swept wings.\nExperience with the Tu-104 led the Tupolev Design Bureau to develop the world's first turbofan series-built airliner, the [[Tupolev Tu-124]], designed for local markets, and subsequently the more commercially successful [[Tupolev Tu-134|Tu-134]].\n\n==Operational history==\n[[File:Tupolev TU-104A Czech Airlines (CSA), LKKB Kbely, Czech Republic PP1185955612.jpg|thumb|Czechoslovak Airlines Tu-104A at [[Kbely Aviation Museum]], Prague]]\nOn 15 September 1956, the Tu-104 began revenue service on Aeroflot's [[Moscow]]-[[Omsk]]-[[Irkutsk]] route, replacing the [[Ilyushin Il-14]]. The flight time was reduced from 13 hours and 50 minutes to 7 hours and 40 minutes, and the new jet dramatically increased the level of passenger comfort.<ref name=Tu104/> By 1957, Aeroflot had placed the Tu-104 in service on routes from [[Vnukovo Airport]] in Moscow to [[London]], [[Budapest]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Beijing]], [[Brussels]], [[Ottawa]], [[Delhi]], and [[Prague]].\n\nIn 1957, [[Czech Airlines|\u010cSA Czechoslovak Airlines]] became the only export customer for the Tu-104, placing the aircraft on routes to [[Moscow]], [[Paris]], and [[Brussels]]. \u010cSA bought six Tu-104As (four new and two used examples) configured for 81 passengers. Three of these aircraft were subsequently written off (one due to a refueling incident in India and another to a pilot error without fatalities).<ref name=Tu104/>\n\nIn 1959 a Tu-104 was leased to Sir Henry Lunn Ltd. ([[Lunn Poly]]) of London which used the aircraft to transport holiday-makers to Russia with a 4.5 hour flight time.\n\nWhilst the Tu-104 continued to be used by Aeroflot throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the safety record of the aircraft was poor, in comparison to other jet airliners of its day (16 out of 96 aircraft were lost in crashes). The Tu-104 was unreliable, heavy, very unstable with poor control response, with an inclination to [[Dutch roll]]. Poor design aerodynamics of the wings resulted in a propensity to stall with little or no warning and a dangerous tendency to pitch-up violently before stalling and entering an irrecoverable dive. Due to the fear of inadvertent stalls aircrew would fly approaches above the recommended approach speed, landing at {{convert|270|-|300|km/h|abbr=on}}, nearly {{convert|50|km/h|abbr=on}} faster. At least 2 accidents were attributed to the pitch-up phenomenon, prompting changes to the design of the aircraft and operating procedures, but the problem remained. Aeroflot retired the Tu-104 from civil service in March 1979 following a fatal accident at Moscow, but several aircraft were transferred to the Soviet military, which used them as staff transports and to train [[cosmonaut]]s in [[Vomit Comet|zero gravity]]. After a military Tu-104 crash in February 1981 killed 52 people (17 were senior army and naval staff), the type was permanently removed from service. The last flight of the Tu-104 was a ferry flight to [[Ulyanovsk Aircraft Museum]] in 1986.\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:Tupolev Tu-104 near Vnukovo Airport - Moscow.JPG|thumb|right|A Tu-104 statue near [[Vnukovo Airport]]]]\n[[File:Tu104 Monino.jpg|thumb|\u0422u-104 preserved at [[Monino]] museum.

Following this trial run, it later expanded to full national syndication for one season, airing from September 9, 1996 to September 5, 1997, with reruns continuing on some stations until 2001. The show was hosted by [[Annie Wood]] (who also served as the show's co-producer) and produced by [[Ralph Edwards]]-Stu Billett Productions.\n \nReruns of the series were first aired on [[WGN America]] from 2000 to 2001 (including the original \"trial run\" season), while [[Buzzr]]\u00a0began airing the series Saturday nights starting on February 15, 2020.\n\n==Premise==\nThe show itself was a fast-paced variant of ''[[The Dating Game]]'' in which a bachelor and bachelorette competed against each other to win a date with a member of the opposite sex, as well as money.\n\n==Round 1==\nThe bachelorette went first. Behind a screen, which the bachelorette could not see through, were four different men, who introduced themselves to the bachelorette one at a time. She then got to ask them each one question after their introduction. After the introductions, she chose the man she liked the least, who was set aside, but not necessarily eliminated.\n\nThe bachelorette now got to interview the remaining three men in detail for a total of two minutes. The bachelorette selected one of the three remaining men to interview. If she did not like the man's answer, she pressed the \"Bzzer\", which caused the set to go dark with BZZZ! showing in red on the wall, thus eliminating him from the game. The \"Bzzz'd\" player was then immediately escorted offstage by Wood, and made to wear earphones so they could not hear why they got \"Bzzz'd\". If all three men were \"bzzz'd\", or the bachelorette's two minutes expired (though this rarely occurred), she was stuck with the man she eliminated during the introductions.\n\nHowever, if she liked the answer a man gives, she rang the bell. If the bachelorette rang the bell before all the men could be questioned, she was shown the remaining bachelors she turned down. Then the process is repeated with a bachelor choosing from four possible bachelorettes. Once the round is finished, round two then began. (In early episodes, the bachelor went first, and the bachelorette went second).\n\n==Round 2 (Simpatico)==\nThe bachelorette and her prospective mate were given a paddle that had two different answers on it. They were both asked to go to a booth where they could not see each other's answer. The host reads a statement, and the players chose their answers, with $50 awarded each time their answers matched. If the pair got a perfect 7 out of 7, they were awarded $1,000. After seven questions, the second couple played the round. Later in the run, round two was played immediately after the first couple was formed, and again after the second couple; plus it was shortened to 5 questions, and each one was worth $100.\n\nThe pair that earned the most money during Round 2 won the game, a prize package, and moved on to the Final Bzzz. Both pairs kept their money.\n\n===Tiebreakers===\nIn the event of a tie, two tiebreakers were used during the show's run.\n\nSeason 1: One couple was asked a percentage question, and asked to offer an answer.  The remaining couple had to guess if the correct answer was higher or lower than the answer the first couple gave.  Whichever couple was more accurate, won the game.\n\nSeason 2: Both couples were asked the question, and both couples offered an answer.  Whichever couple was closest ''without going over'' won the game. In the event both couples were over, the winner would be the couple that went over the least.\n\n==Final Bzzz!==\nIntroduced halfway through the initial trial run, this round reversed the earlier roles, with the original bachelor/bachelorette being interviewed by their prospected mate. If the mate rang the bell, the date was on, and the show paid for all the expenses.

The show was hosted by [[Annie Wood]] (who also served as the show's co-producer) and produced by [[Ralph Edwards]]-Stu Billett Productions. \n[[Buzzr]]\u00a0began airing repeats on Saturday nights starting on February 15, 2020.\n\n==Premise==\nThe show itself was a fast-paced variant of ''[[The Dating Game]]'' in which a bachelor and bachelorette competed against each other to win a date with a member of the opposite sex, as well as money.\n\n==Round 1==\nThe bachelorette went first. Behind a screen, which the bachelorette could not see through, were four different men, who introduced themselves to the bachelorette one at a time. She then got to ask them each one question after their introduction. After the introductions, she chose the man she liked the least, who was set aside, but not necessarily eliminated.\n\nThe bachelorette now got to interview the remaining three men in detail for a total of two minutes. The bachelorette selected one of the three remaining men to interview. If she did not like the man's answer, she pressed the \"Bzzer\", which caused the set to go dark with BZZZ! showing in red on the wall, thus eliminating him from the game. The \"Bzzz'd\" player was then immediately escorted offstage by Wood, and made to wear earphones so they could not hear why they got \"Bzzz'd\". If all three men were \"bzzz'd\", or the bachelorette's two minutes expired (though this rarely occurred), she was stuck with the man she eliminated during the introductions.\n\nHowever, if she liked the answer a man gives, she rang the bell. If the bachelorette rang the bell before all the men could be questioned, she was shown the remaining bachelors she turned down. Then the process is repeated with a bachelor choosing from four possible bachelorettes. Once the round is finished, round two then began. (In early episodes, the bachelor went first, and the bachelorette went second).\n\n==Round 2 (Simpatico)==\nThe bachelorette and her prospective mate were given a paddle that had two different answers on it. They were both asked to go to a booth where they could not see each other's answer. The host reads a statement, and the players chose their answers, with $50 awarded each time their answers matched. If the pair got a perfect 7 out of 7, they were awarded $1,000. After seven questions, the second couple played the round. Later in the run, round two was played immediately after the first couple was formed, and again after the second couple; plus it was shortened to 5 questions, and each one was worth $100.\n\nThe pair that earned the most money during Round 2 won the game, a prize package, and moved on to the Final Bzzz. Both pairs kept their money.\n\n===Tiebreakers===\nIn the event of a tie, two tiebreakers were used during the show's run.\n\nSeason 1: One couple was asked a percentage question, and asked to offer an answer.  The remaining couple had to guess if the correct answer was higher or lower than the answer the first couple gave.  Whichever couple was more accurate, won the game.\n\nSeason 2: Both couples were asked the question, and both couples offered an answer.  Whichever couple was closest ''without going over'' won the game. In the event both couples were over, the winner would be the couple that went over the least.\n\n==Final Bzzz!==\nIntroduced halfway through the first season, this round reversed the earlier roles, with the original bachelor/bachelorette being interviewed by their prospected mate. If the mate rang the bell, the date was on, and the show paid for all the expenses. However, if the mate hit the \"Bzzer\", the date was off, and the mate was given a prize package for their trouble.\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20000520082342/http://www.bzzz.com/ Official Website]\n*{{IMDb title|0463806}}\n{{Tribune}}\n\n[[Category:1996 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1997 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:1990s American game shows]]\n[[Category:Dating and relationship reality television series]]\n[[Category:Television series by Tribune Entertainment]]\n[[Category:Television series by Ralph Edwards Productions]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:First-run syndicated television programs in the United States]]\n", "name_user": "RadioChuck", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added mention of WGN America reruns, which included the winter 96 trial run, and clarified that the halfway point of the latter season was when the Final Bzzz! round debuted.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bzzz!"}

Insulin is released by the pancreas in response to carbohydrates consumed in the diet. In states of insulin resistance, the same amount of insulin does not have the same effect on glucose transport and blood sugar levels. There are many causes of insulin resistance and the underlying process is still incompletely understood. Risk factors for insulin resistance include [[obesity]], [[sedentary lifestyle]], family history of diabetes, various health conditions, and certain medications. Insulin resistance is considered a component of the [[metabolic syndrome]]. There are multiple ways to measure insulin resistance such as fasting insulin levels or glucose tolerance tests but these are not often used in clinical practice. Insulin resistance can be improved or reversed with lifestyle approaches such as exercise and dietary changes.\n\n==Cause==\n===Risk factors===\nThere are a number of risk factors for insulin resistance, including being overweight or obese or having a [[sedentary lifestyle]].<ref name=\":4\"/> Various genetic factors can increase risk, such as a family history of diabetes, and there are some specific medical conditions associated with insulin resistance, such as [[polycystic ovary syndrome]].<ref name=\":4\">{{cite web |publisher=[[National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases]] |date=May 2018 |url=https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/what-is-diabetes/prediabetes-insulin-resistance |title=Insulin Resistance &amp; Prediabetes}}</ref>\n\nThe [[National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases]] state specific risks also include:\n* being aged 45 or older\n* having African American, Alaska Native, American Indian, Asian American, Hispanic/Latino, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander American ethnicity\n* having health conditions such as high blood pressure and abnormal cholesterol levels\n* having a history of gestational diabetes\n* having a history of heart disease or stroke.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nIn addition some medications and other health conditions can raise the risk.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n===Lifestyle Factors===\nDietary factors likely contribute to insulin resistance, however causative foods are difficult to determine given the limitations of nutrition research.

Certain cell types such as [[fat]] and [[muscle]] cells require insulin to absorb glucose and when these cells fail to respond adequately to circulating insulin, blood glucose levels rise. The [[liver]] normally helps regulate glucose levels by reducing its secretion of glucose in the presence of insulin. However, in insulin resistance, this normal reduction in the liver's glucose production may not occur, further contributing to elevated blood glucose.<ref>{{cite web |date=Jun 2009 | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/06/090621143236.htm |title= Science daily |website= |access-date=}}</ref>\n\nInsulin resistance in [[adipose tissue|fat cells]] results in reduced uptake of circulating lipids and increased [[hydrolysis]] of stored [[triglyceride]]s.

With respect to visceral adiposity, a great deal of evidence suggests two strong links with insulin resistance. First, unlike subcutaneous adipose tissue, visceral adipose cells produce significant amounts of proinflammatory [[cytokines]] such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha ([[TNF-a]]), and [[Interleukins]]-1 and \u22126, etc. In numerous experimental models, these proinflammatory cytokines disrupt normal insulin action in fat and muscle cells, and may be a major factor in causing the whole-body insulin resistance observed in patients with visceral adiposity. Much of the attention on production of proinflammatory cytokines has focused on the IKK-beta/[[NF-kappa-B]] pathway, a protein network that enhances transcription of inflammatory markers and mediators that may cause insulin resistance. Second, visceral adiposity is related to an accumulation of fat in the liver, a condition known as [[non-alcoholic fatty liver disease]] (NAFLD). The result of NAFLD is an excessive release of free fatty acids into the bloodstream (due to increased lipolysis), and an increase in hepatic glycogenolysis and hepatic glucose production, both of which have the effect of exacerbating peripheral insulin resistance and increasing the likelihood of [[T2DM|Type 2 diabetes mellitus]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nAlso, insulin resistance often is associated with a [[hypercoagulable state]] (impaired [[fibrinolysis]]) and increased inflammatory cytokine levels.<ref name=\"nagaev\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Nagaev I, Bokarewa M, Tarkowski A, Smith U | title = Human resistin is a systemic immune-derived proinflammatory cytokine targeting both leukocytes and adipocytes | journal = PLOS One | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = e31 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17183659 | pmc = 1762367 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0000031 | editor1-last = Valcarcel | bibcode = 2006PLoSO...1...31N | editor1-first = Juan }}</ref>\n\n=== Molecular mechanism ===\nAt the molecular level, a cell senses insulin through insulin receptors, with the signal propagating through a signaling cascade collectively known as [[PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway|PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway]].<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang G | title = Singularity analysis of the AKT signaling pathway reveals connections between cancer and metabolic diseases | journal = Physical Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 046015 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21178243 | doi = 10.1088/1478-3975/7/4/046015 | bibcode = 2010PhBio...7d6015W }}</ref> Recent studies suggested that the pathway may operate as a [[Bistability#In biological and chemical systems|bistable]] switch under physiologic conditions for certain types of cells, and insulin response may well be a threshold phenomenon.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang G | title = Raison d'\u00eatre of insulin resistance: the adjustable threshold hypothesis | journal = Journal of the Royal Society, Interface | volume = 11 | issue = 101 | pages = 20140892 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25320065 | pmc = 4223910 | doi = 10.1098/rsif.2014.0892 }}</ref><ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang G | title = Optimal homeostasis necessitates bistable control | journal = Journal of the Royal Society, Interface | volume = 9 | issue = 75 | pages = 2723\u201334 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 22535698 | pmc = 3427521 | doi = 10.1098/rsif.2012.0244 }}</ref> The pathway's sensitivity to insulin may be blunted by many factors such as free fatty acids,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lucidi P, Rossetti P, Porcellati F, Pampanelli S, Candeloro P, Andreoli AM, Perriello G, Bolli GB, Fanelli CG | display-authors = 6 | title = Mechanisms of insulin resistance after insulin-induced hypoglycemia in humans: the role of lipolysis | journal = Diabetes | volume = 59 | issue = 6 | pages = 1349\u201357 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20299466 | pmc = 2874695 | doi = 10.2337/db09-0745 }}</ref> causing insulin resistance.

Then blood glucose levels are measured over the following two hours.\n\nInterpretation is based on [[WHO]] guidelines. After two hours a [[blood sugar|glycemia]] less than 7.8&nbsp;mmol/L (140&nbsp;mg/dL) is considered normal, a glycemia of between 7.8 and 11.0&nbsp;mmol/L (140 to 197&nbsp;mg/dL) is considered as [[impaired glucose tolerance]] (IGT), and a glycemia of greater than or equal to 11.1&nbsp;mmol/L (200&nbsp;mg/dL) is considered [[diabetes mellitus]].\n\nAn [[oral glucose tolerance test]] (OGTT) may be normal or mildly abnormal in simple insulin resistance. Often, there are raised glucose levels in the early measurements, reflecting the loss of a postprandial peak (after the meal) in insulin production. Extension of the testing (for several more hours) may reveal a [[hypoglycemia|hypoglycemic]] \"dip,\" that is a result of an overshoot in insulin production after the failure of the physiologic postprandial insulin response.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n===Hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp===\nThe [[gold standard (test)|gold standard]] for investigating and quantifying insulin resistance is the \"hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp,\" so-called because it measures the amount of [[glucose]] necessary to compensate for an increased [[insulin]] level without causing [[hypoglycemia]].<ref name = Anders_1979>{{cite journal | vauthors = DeFronzo RA, Tobin JD, Andres R | title = Glucose clamp technique: a method for quantifying insulin secretion and resistance | journal = The American Journal of Physiology | volume = 237 | issue = 3 | pages = E214-23 | date = September 1979 | pmid = 382871 | doi = 10.1152/ajpendo.1979.237.3.e214 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/be35fd54576035e86ead68f84c06ad0d9d6a5218 }}</ref> It is a type of [[glucose clamp technique]].

Through a [[peripheral vein]], [[insulin]] is infused at 10\u2013120 mU per m<sup>2</sup> per [[minute]]. In order to compensate for the insulin [[intravenous|infusion]], [[glucose]] 20% is infused to maintain blood sugar levels between 5 and 5.5&nbsp;mmol/L. The rate of glucose infusion is determined by checking the [[blood sugar]] levels every five to ten minutes.<ref name=\"Muniyappa\" />\n\nThe rate of glucose infusion during the last thirty minutes of the test determines insulin sensitivity. If high levels (7.5&nbsp;mg/min or higher) are required, the patient is insulin-sensitive. Very low levels (4.0&nbsp;mg/min or lower) indicate that the body is resistant to insulin action. Levels between 4.0 and 7.5&nbsp;mg/min are not definitive, and suggest \"impaired glucose tolerance,\" an early sign of insulin resistance.<ref name=\"Muniyappa\" />\n\nThis basic technique may be enhanced significantly by the use of glucose tracers. Glucose may be labeled with either stable or radioactive atoms. Commonly used tracers are 3-<sup>3</sup>H glucose (radioactive), 6,6 <sup>2</sup>H-glucose (stable) and 1-<sup>13</sup>C Glucose (stable). Prior to beginning the hyperinsulinemic period, a 3h tracer infusion enables one to determine the basal rate of glucose production. During the clamp, the plasma tracer concentrations enable the calculation of whole-body insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism, as well as the production of glucose by the body (i.e., endogenous glucose production).<ref name=\"Muniyappa\" />\n\n===Modified insulin suppression test===\nAnother measure of insulin resistance is the modified insulin suppression test developed by Gerald Reaven at Stanford University. The test correlates well with the euglycemic clamp, with less operator-dependent error.

Next, insulin and 20% glucose are infused at rates of 32 and 267&nbsp;mg/m<sup>2</sup>/min, respectively. Blood glucose is checked at zero, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes, and thereafter, every 10 minutes for the last half-hour of the test. These last four values are averaged to determine the steady-state plasma glucose level (SSPG). Subjects with an SSPG greater than 150&nbsp;mg/dL are considered to be insulin-resistant.<ref name=\"Muniyappa\" />\n\n===Alternatives===\nGiven the complicated nature of the \"clamp\" technique (and the potential dangers of [[hypoglycemia]] in some patients), alternatives have been sought to simplify the measurement of insulin resistance. The first was the [[homeostatic model assessment|Homeostatic Model Assessment]] (HOMA), and a more recent method is the [[Quantitative insulin sensitivity check index]] (QUICKI). Both employ [[fasting]] [[insulin]] and [[glucose]] levels to calculate insulin resistance, and both correlate reasonably with the results of clamping studies.\n\n==Prevention and management==\nMaintaining a healthy body weight and being physically active can help reduce the risk of developing insulin resistance.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThe primary treatment for insulin resistance is [[exercise]] and [[weight loss]].{{mcn|date=July 2019}} Both [[metformin]] and [[thiazolidinedione]]s improve insulin resistance.

Insulin is released by the pancreas in response to carbohydrates consumed in the diet. In states of insulin resistance, the same amount of insulin does not have the same effect on glucose transport and blood sugar levels. There are many causes of insulin resistance and the underlying process is still incompletely understood. Risk factors for insulin resistance include [[obesity]], [[Sedentary lifestyle|sedentary lifestyle,]] family history of diabetes, various health conditions, and certain medications. Insulin resistance is considered a component of the [[metabolic syndrome]]. There are multiple ways to measure insulin resistance such as fasting insulin levels or glucose tolerance tests but these are not often used in clinical practice. Insulin resistance can be improved or reversed with lifestyle approaches such as exercise and dietary changes. \n==Cause==\n\n===Risk factors===\nThere are a number of risk factors for insulin resistance, including being overweight or obese or having a [[sedentary lifestyle]].<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases]] |date=May 2018 |url=https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/what-is-diabetes/prediabetes-insulin-resistance |title=Insulin Resistance &amp; Prediabetes}}</ref>  Various genetic factors can increase risk, such as a family history of diabetes, and there are some specific medical conditions associated with insulin resistance, such as [[polycystic ovary syndrome]].<ref name=\":4\">{{cite web |publisher=[[National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases]] |date=May 2018 |url=https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/what-is-diabetes/prediabetes-insulin-resistance |title=Insulin Resistance &amp; Prediabetes}}</ref> \n\nThe [[National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases]] state specific risks also include:\n\n* being aged 45 or older\n* having African American, Alaska Native, American Indian, Asian American, Hispanic/Latino, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander American ethnicity\n* having health conditions such as high blood pressure and abnormal cholesterol levels\n* having a history of gestational diabetes\n* having a history of heart disease or stroke.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nIn addition some medications and other health conditions can raise the risk.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n===Lifestyle Factors===\n\nDietary factors likely contribute to insulin resistance, however causative foods are difficult to determine given the limitations of nutrition research.

Certain cell types such as [[fat]] and [[muscle]] cells require insulin to absorb glucose and when these cells fail to respond adequately to circulating insulin, blood glucose levels rise. The [[liver]] normally helps regulate glucose levels by reducing its secretion of glucose in the presence of insulin.

With respect to visceral adiposity, a great deal of evidence suggests two strong links with insulin resistance. First, unlike subcutaneous adipose tissue, visceral adipose cells produce significant amounts of proinflammatory [[cytokines]] such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha ([[TNF-a]]), and [[Interleukins]]-1 and \u22126, etc. In numerous experimental models, these proinflammatory cytokines disrupt normal insulin action in fat and muscle cells, and may be a major factor in causing the whole-body insulin resistance observed in patients with visceral adiposity. Much of the attention on production of proinflammatory cytokines has focused on the IKK-beta/[[NF-kappa-B]] pathway, a protein network that enhances transcription of inflammatory markers and mediators that may cause insulin resistance. Second, visceral adiposity is related to an accumulation of fat in the liver, a condition known as [[non-alcoholic fatty liver disease]] (NAFLD). The result of NAFLD is an excessive release of free fatty acids into the bloodstream (due to increased lipolysis), and an increase in hepatic glycogenolysis and hepatic glucose production, both of which have the effect of exacerbating peripheral insulin resistance and increasing the likelihood of [[T2DM|Type 2 diabetes mellitus]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nAlso, insulin resistance often is associated with a [[hypercoagulable state]] (impaired [[fibrinolysis]]) and increased inflammatory cytokine levels.<ref name=\"nagaev\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Nagaev I, Bokarewa M, Tarkowski A, Smith U | title = Human resistin is a systemic immune-derived proinflammatory cytokine targeting both leukocytes and adipocytes | journal = PLOS One | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = e31 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17183659 | pmc = 1762367 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0000031 | editor1-last = Valcarcel | bibcode = 2006PLoSO...1...31N | editor1-first = Juan }}</ref>\n\n=== Molecular mechanism ===\nAt the molecular level, a cell senses insulin through insulin receptors, with the signal propagating through a signaling cascade collectively known as [[PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway|PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway]].<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang G | title = Singularity analysis of the AKT signaling pathway reveals connections between cancer and metabolic diseases | journal = Physical Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 046015 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21178243 | doi = 10.1088/1478-3975/7/4/046015 | bibcode = 2010PhBio...7d6015W }}</ref> Recent studies suggested that the pathway may operate as a [[Bistability#In biological and chemical systems|bistable]] switch under physiologic conditions for certain types of cells, and insulin response may well be a threshold phenomenon.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang G | title = Raison d'\u00eatre of insulin resistance: the adjustable threshold hypothesis | journal = Journal of the Royal Society, Interface | volume = 11 | issue = 101 | pages = 20140892 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25320065 | pmc = 4223910 | doi = 10.1098/rsif.2014.0892 }}</ref><ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang G | title = Optimal homeostasis necessitates bistable control | journal = Journal of the Royal Society, Interface | volume = 9 | issue = 75 | pages = 2723\u201334 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 22535698 | pmc = 3427521 | doi = 10.1098/rsif.2012.0244 }}</ref> The pathway's sensitivity to insulin may be blunted by many factors such as free fatty acids,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lucidi P, Rossetti P, Porcellati F, Pampanelli S, Candeloro P, Andreoli AM, Perriello G, Bolli GB, Fanelli CG | display-authors = 6 | title = Mechanisms of insulin resistance after insulin-induced hypoglycemia in humans: the role of lipolysis | journal = Diabetes | volume = 59 | issue = 6 | pages = 1349\u201357 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20299466 | pmc = 2874695 | doi = 10.2337/db09-0745 }}</ref> causing insulin resistance.

Often, there are raised glucose levels in the early measurements, reflecting the loss of a postprandial peak (after the meal) in insulin production. Extension of the testing (for several more hours) may reveal a [[hypoglycemia|hypoglycemic]] \"dip,\" that is a result of an overshoot in insulin production after the failure of the physiologic postprandial insulin response.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n===Hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp===\nThe [[gold standard (test)|gold standard]] for investigating and quantifying insulin resistance is the \"hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp,\" so-called because it measures the amount of [[glucose]] necessary to compensate for an increased [[insulin]] level without causing [[hypoglycemia]].<ref name = Anders_1979>{{cite journal | vauthors = DeFronzo RA, Tobin JD, Andres R | title = Glucose clamp technique: a method for quantifying insulin secretion and resistance | journal = The American Journal of Physiology | volume = 237 | issue = 3 | pages = E214-23 | date = September 1979 | pmid = 382871 | doi = 10.1152/ajpendo.1979.237.3.e214 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/be35fd54576035e86ead68f84c06ad0d9d6a5218 }}</ref> It is a type of [[glucose clamp technique]]. The test is rarely performed in clinical care, but is used in medical research, for example, to assess the effects of different medications. The rate of glucose infusion commonly is referred to in diabetes literature as the GINF value.<ref name=\"Muniyappa\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Muniyappa R, Lee S, Chen H, Quon MJ | title = Current approaches for assessing insulin sensitivity and resistance in vivo: advantages, limitations, and appropriate usage | journal = American Journal of Physiology.

Through a [[peripheral vein]], [[insulin]] is infused at 10\u2013120 mU per m<sup>2</sup> per [[minute]]. In order to compensate for the insulin [[intravenous|infusion]], [[glucose]] 20% is infused to maintain blood sugar levels between 5 and 5.5&nbsp;mmol/L. The rate of glucose infusion is determined by checking the [[blood sugar]] levels every five to ten minutes.<ref name=\"Muniyappa\" />\n\nThe rate of glucose infusion during the last thirty minutes of the test determines insulin sensitivity. If high levels (7.5&nbsp;mg/min or higher) are required, the patient is insulin-sensitive. Very low levels (4.0&nbsp;mg/min or lower) indicate that the body is resistant to insulin action. Levels between 4.0 and 7.5&nbsp;mg/min are not definitive, and suggest \"impaired glucose tolerance,\" an early sign of insulin resistance.<ref name=\"Muniyappa\" />\n\nThis basic technique may be enhanced significantly by the use of glucose tracers. Glucose may be labeled with either stable or radioactive atoms. Commonly used tracers are 3-<sup>3</sup>H glucose (radioactive), 6,6 <sup>2</sup>H-glucose (stable) and 1-<sup>13</sup>C Glucose (stable). Prior to beginning the hyperinsulinemic period, a 3h tracer infusion enables one to determine the basal rate of glucose production. During the clamp, the plasma tracer concentrations enable the calculation of whole-body insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism, as well as the production of glucose by the body (i.e., endogenous glucose production).<ref name=\"Muniyappa\" />\n\n===Modified insulin suppression test===\nAnother measure of insulin resistance is the modified insulin suppression test developed by Gerald Reaven at Stanford University. The test correlates well with the euglycemic clamp, with less operator-dependent error. This test has been used to advance the large body of research relating to the metabolic syndrome.<ref name = \"Muniyappa\" />\n\nPatients initially receive 25 \u03bcg of [[octreotide]] (Sandostatin) in 5 mL of normal saline over 3 to 5 minutes via intravenous infusion (IV) as an initial bolus, and then, are infused continuously with an intravenous infusion of [[somatostatin]] (0.27 \u03bcg/m<sup>2</sup>/min) to suppress endogenous insulin and glucose secretion. Next, insulin and 20% glucose are infused at rates of 32 and 267&nbsp;mg/m<sup>2</sup>/min, respectively. Blood glucose is checked at zero, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes, and thereafter, every 10 minutes for the last half-hour of the test. These last four values are averaged to determine the steady-state plasma glucose level (SSPG). Subjects with an SSPG greater than 150&nbsp;mg/dL are considered to be insulin-resistant.<ref name=\"Muniyappa\" />\n\n===Alternatives===\nGiven the complicated nature of the \"clamp\" technique (and the potential dangers of [[hypoglycemia]] in some patients), alternatives have been sought to simplify the measurement of insulin resistance. The first was the [[homeostatic model assessment|Homeostatic Model Assessment]] (HOMA), and a more recent method is the [[Quantitative insulin sensitivity check index]] (QUICKI). Both employ [[fasting]] [[insulin]] and [[glucose]] levels to calculate insulin resistance, and both correlate reasonably with the results of clamping studies. \n\n==Prevention and management==\nMaintaining a healthy body weight and being physically active can help reduce the risk of developing insulin resistance.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThe primary treatment for insulin resistance is [[exercise]] and [[weight loss]].{{mcn|date=July 2019}} Both [[metformin]] and [[thiazolidinedione]]s improve insulin resistance.

Several factors motivated this drive\u2014fear of annexation by the United States, overwhelming debt created by rapid population growth, the need for government-funded services to support this population, and the economic depression caused by the end of the gold rush. With the agreement by the Canadian government to extend the Canadian Pacific Railway to British Columbia and to assume the colony's debt, British Columbia became the sixth province to join Confederation on 20 July 1871. The borders of the province were not completely settled until 1903, however, when the province's territory shrank somewhat after the [[Alaska boundary dispute]] settled the vague boundary of the [[Alaska Panhandle]].\n\n==Construction==\n\n===The Pacific Scandal===\n[[Image:Hells Gate.jpg|thumb|right|Hells Gate\u2014CPR tracks by birch trees lower right; highway upper left]]\n\n[[Sir John A. Macdonald]]'s government fell in 1873 due to [[Pacific Scandal|corruption in railway contracts]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cpconnectingcanada.ca/our-history/|title=Connecting Canada|website=cpconnectingcanada.ca|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>. [[Alexander Mackenzie (politician)|Alexander Mackenzie]] succeeded Macdonald as [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] and embarked on a very slow building process in [[Manitoba]]. At this time there was also a severe financial depression, due to the [[Credit Mobilier scandal]] and the building of the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] in the US.  Also at this time, the government of Canada embarked on many surveys across the [[Rocky Mountains]] searching for the best route. Half a dozen routes were investigated, among them [[Pine Pass]], Rocky Mountain Canyon, Yellowhead and Kootenay Crossing. These myriad surveys took time, effort and money\u2014money which would have been better spent on just one or two surveys.\n\nMacdonald returned to power in 1878 and truly began to get on with the job of the railway. The government of Canada contracted with [[Andrew Onderdonk]] to build a railway two hundred miles from [[Port Moody]] on the Pacific tidewater to Savona's Ferry, some thirty miles west of modern [[Kamloops]]. Public Works Minister [[Sir Sandford Fleming]] had chosen the [[Fraser Canyon]] route with its fearsome Hell's Gate torrent, steep granite chasms, winding valleys and rockfalls. Other surveys had been conducted down [[Bute Inlet]], Dean Channel, [[Howe Sound]] and Harrison Lake but were found wanting. Fleming favoured the [[Yellowhead Pass]] as the best route. At any rate, the blasting and tunnelling through the tortuous Pacific Cascade Mountains would take half-a-dozen years, and the route could drive from Kamloops to Jasper after Onderdonk's crews had finished.\n\n===Canadian Pacific Railway===\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway Bill was approved by the House of Commons, and in February 1881 the company came into existence. It agreed to build the railway in exchange for $25,000,000 (approximately $625,000,000 in modern Canadian dollars) in credit from the Canadian government and a grant of {{convert|25,000,000|acre|km2}} of land<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Canadian-Pacific-Railway-Ltd|title=Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. {{!}} Canadian company|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>. The government transferred to the new company those sections of the railway it had constructed. The government also defrayed the cost of surveying, and exempted the railway from property taxes for 20 years. The Montreal-based syndicate officially consisted of five men\u2014George Stephen, James J. Hill, Duncan McIntyre, Richard B. Angus, and John Stewart Kennedy. Donald A. Smith and Norman Kittson were unofficial silent partners with a significant financial interest.\n\n===Chinese workers===\n[[Image:Hell's Gate, British Columbia 2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|View of Hell's Gate looking across to east bank, w. CPR steam locomotive in background passing old railway housing, c.1945]]\n[[Image:Canadian steam.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Engine 374, the first passenger train to arrive in Vancouver on the transcontinental railway in 1886.]]\n\nDue to a shortage of workers, Onderdonk contracted labour agents in [[Kowloon]] to supply six thousand Chinese [[coolies]] for the project. The province was outraged at the mass transfer of labour and \"Asiatics\", fearing that both  would upset the white Anglo-Saxon classes in ''British'' Columbia. Macdonald ceded to Onderdonk, due to the savings in labour costs.  BC at the time only had a population of two or three thousand Europeans\u2014not nearly enough to build such a large project.  Macdonald quipped that BC could either have Chinese workers and a railway, or no Chinese workers and no railway. Historians estimate he brought in a total of 15 000 Chinese from China and from California<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/canadian-pacific-railway|title=Canadian Pacific Railway {{!}} The Canadian Encyclopedia|website=www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>. Chinese workers were kept on crews separate from the white workers and often given the most dangerous jobs, including tunnel-blasting using highly unstable nitroglycerin. Many Chinese laborers were killed in accidents or died of scurvy during the winter, though part of the blame for the scurvy deaths lay with the workers' reliance on rice as a staple. Unlike white workers, injured Chinese workers were not given access to the company hospital and were abandoned to the rest of the workers for help. Discrimination and racism led to fights between Chinese and white workers, including white foremen of Chinese crews.  Chinese workers were generally seen by management as efficient, hardworking and well-behaved.\nThe Chinese crews worked year-round in the cliffs and forests, leveling grades. [[Navvy|Navvies]] received between $1 and $2.50 per day but had to pay for their own food, clothing, transportation to the job site, mail and medical care. After two-and-a-half months of back-breaking labour, they could net as little as $16. Chinese navvies in British Columbia made only between $0.75 and $1.25 a day (not including expenses), leaving hardly anything to send home. They did the most dangerous construction jobs. The families of the Chinese who were killed received no compensation\u2014not even notification of loss of life. Many of the men who survived did not have enough money to return to their families in China and spent years in lonely, sad and (often) poor conditions.\n\n===Michael Haney===\nOnderdonk engaged Irishman [[Michael James Haney]], a superior foreman. Haney saw the problem of the rivers, gorges, and cliffs and realized that Onderdonk would need extensive [[Trestle bridge|bridging]].  To solve this problem, Haney built a [[steam-power]]ed [[sawmill]] at [[Haney, British Columbia|Haney]] to cut standardized [[timber]]s. Crews also cut bridge [[Bent (structural)|bents]] ([[Framing (construction)|framework]] [[Stiffening#Mechanics|reinforcements]]), so the advance crews only had to submit measurements to Haney and he would custom-build a [[woodwork]] for that [[mile marker]] of track.  The prime [[Douglas fir]] of the [[Fraser Valley]] provided ideal timber. Lumber for ties was also cut at [[Texas Creek (Fraser River)|Texas Creek]], and timber was cut at the [[Chehalis River (British Columbia)|Chehalis River]] near [[Kilby Provincial Park|Kilby]]. Other crews were engaged around the province cutting and squaring [[Cross tie (railroad)|crosstiea]] by the million.\n\n===1885: the critical year===\n[[Image:Big Hill CPR.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Looking west, 1890. Safety Switch No. 1 and its uphill spur are shown foreground and right; the [[truss bridge]] under the rear of the train, now known as the \"Old Bridge\", survives as a tourist attraction]]\n[[Image:Power exits Lower Spiral.jpg|thumb|left|Lower portal of \"Number Two\" tunnel, Spiral Tunnels, Field, British Columbia. The locomotives are passing under the train they are pulling.]]\nThe ongoing cost of construction crews, crossing mountains, rivers and the [[Canadian Shield]] completely undid construction estimates and the CPR was nearly bankrupt in 1885. To prevent financial ruin CPR crews stopped building in masonry and steel,  opting for tree-pole construction with bridge trestles built from nearby trees.  Snowsheds, easy routings and sidings were omitted to reduce costs. Only the intervention of Lord Revelstoke of [[Barings Bank]] of London with another loan gave the CPR enough financing to finish the job. The greatest disadvantage of the route was in [[Kicking Horse Pass]]. In the first {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of the {{convert|1,625|m|ft|adj=mid|high}} summit, the Kicking Horse River drops {{convert|350|m|ft|0}}. The steep drop would force the cash-strapped CPR to build a {{convert|7|km|mi|adj=on}}-long stretch of track with a very steep 4.5% [[Grade (slope)|gradient]] when it reached the pass in 1884. This was over four times the maximum gradient recommended for railways of this era; even modern railways rarely exceed a 2% gradient. However, this route was far more direct than one through the [[Yellowhead Pass]] and saved hours for both passengers and freight. This section of track was the [[Big Hill]]. [[Safety]] [[Switch (railway)|switches]] were installed at several points, the speed limit for descending trains was set at {{convert|10|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} and special locomotives were ordered. Despite these measures, several serious [[Runaway train|runaways]] still occurred. CPR officials insisted that this was a temporary expediency, but this state of affairs would last for 25 years until the completion of the [[Big Hill#The Spiral Tunnels|Spiral Tunnels]] in the early 20th century.\n\n===Strike at Golden===\nMoney problems triggered a strike at a construction camp near Golden in March, 1885. Work crews had not been paid for months, and downed their tools. The [[North-West Mounted Police]] and company foremen attempted to calm the situation. Promises were made by the company which ameliorated the stalemate, and the crews went back to work.\n\n===Last spike===\n[[Image:The Last Spike Plaque.jpg|thumb|100px|A plaque commemorating the driving of the ''last spike'']]\nThe [[North-West Rebellion]] in [[District of Saskatchewan|Saskatchewan]] was quickly put down with troops travelling over the CPR. Perhaps because the government was grateful for this service, it subsequently reorganized the CPR's debt and provided a further $5,000,000 loan\u2014money which was desperately needed by the CPR. On November 7, 1885, the [[Last Spike (Canadian Pacific Railway)|Last Spike]] was driven at [[Craigellachie, British Columbia]], making good on the original promise. Four days earlier, the last spike of the [[Lake Superior]] section was driven just west of Jackfish, Ontario. While the railway was completed four years after the original 1881 deadline, it was completed more than five years ahead of the 1891 deadline issued by Macdonald in 1881.\n[[Image:Eastbound over SCB.jpg|thumb|200px|left|An eastbound CPR freight at [[Stoney Creek Bridge]] in [[Rogers Pass (British Columbia)|Rogers Pass]]. Photo by David R. Spencer.]]\n\n===Extension of the line from Port Moody===\nAfter the completion of the through line to [[Montreal]], Sir [[William Cornelius Van Horne]] looked at [[Port Moody]] and [[Burrard Inlet]] and decided to move the terminus to Gastown and [[False Creek]].  Land was secretly obtained from the provincial government and landowners to prevent speculation, and work crews extended the line 11 miles west to the [[City of Vancouver]]. [[Engine 374]] pulled the first passenger train into Vancouver on May 23, 1887; it was a banner year for the city.\n\nCanadian Pacific agents operated in many overseas locations. Immigrants were often sold a package that included passage on a CP ship, travel on a CP train, and land sold by the CP Railway priced at $2.50 an acre and up. Immigrants paid very little for a seven-day journey to the west. They rode in cars with sleeping facilities and a small kitchen at one end of each car. Children were not allowed off the train, lest they wander off and be left behind. The directors of the CPR knew that not only were they creating a nation, but also a long-term source of revenue for their company.\n\n==Since completion==\n\n===Founding of Vancouver===\n[[Vancouver]] was founded in 1886 as an adjunct to the arrival of the railway.  The CPR was given extensive lands in the Vancouver area\u2014the West End, lands west of Cambie Street, False Creek and the [[Dunbar-Southlands|Southlands]] area stretching to the Fraser River. Posh subdivisions were built, due to the railway's influence.  The Drake Street Roundhouse was built on False Creek, and [[Yaletown]] emerged. The City of Vancouver was incorporated on 6 April 1886, the year the first transcontinental train arrived. The name (honouring [[George Vancouver]]) was chosen by CPR president William Van Horne, who arrived in Port Moody to establish the CPR terminus recommended by Henry John Cambie. A massive \"slash burn\" (clearing fire) broke out of control on 13 June 1886, razing the entire city. It was quickly rebuilt, and the Vancouver Fire Department was established that same year.\n\n===Enter the CPR Pacific Steamers===\n[[Image:Empress of China 1891.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The Empress of China, 1891]]\n\nThe CPR chartered ocean steamers ''Batavia'', ''Abyssinia'' and ''Parthia'' to enter the China tea trade. The CPR then built their well-known Empress ships. The {{RMS|Empress of China}} began liner service in 1891.\n\n===Profitability===\nThe completion of the line and extension of the steamers put the railway in the black. From this, it began a program of infrastructure upgrades; the temporary [[Trestle bridge|trestles]] were changed to stone and steel. Snowsheds were built, as were rail yards, spurs, coalsheds and watertowers. The CPR sought cargo for its trains\u2014lumber from the Hastings mill, fish from [[Steveston]], fruit from the [[Okanagan]], minerals from the Kootenays and immigrants from Europe.  With this in mind, the railway expanded with spurs to the Okanagan, the [[Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway]], and a southern link from [[Port Coquitlam]] to [[New Westminster]] and Eburne.\n\n===Various disasters===\nWhile the CPR was doing well on the financial front, heavy slides in the Rogers Pass would often close the line in the month of March. Crews were dispatched to the area to shovel snow, which worked until 1910 when another slide came down on a work crew. Rains in 1894 washed out bridges and rail lines in a number of places. The line also had ongoing trouble with the Big Hill, including  several [[runaway train]]s.\n[[Image:Vancouver Waterfront Station.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|Waterfront Station in [[Vancouver]].]]\n\n===Turn of the century===\nBy the turn of the 20th century, the railway was a going concern and made its mark on the world stage.  Major hotels were begun, such as the [[The Empress (hotel)|Empress Hotel]] in Victoria, the [[Second Hotel Vancouver]], Glacier House, the [[Banff Springs Hotel]] and [[Chateau Lake Louise]].  Heavier railway equipment was built and ordered to keep up with the increased tonnage, and with the heavier trains came heavier bridges.  One ongoing problem was the onerous grade up the Kicking Horse Pass. The heavy trains needed batteries of engines to get over the Big Hill.  From this the Spiral Tunnels evolved, and construction began to build the long tunnels under the mountains.\n\n===The Crow's Nest Pass===\nThe CP empire had driven south from [[Calgary]] in the 1890s to reach the coal mines of [[Lethbridge]]; also, a link was made to the US lines in [[Montana]]. From this, the CPR wanted to build a line to the rich coalfields of [[Fernie, British Columbia|Fernie]] over the Rocky Mountains in BC. A line was built from Alberta across the Crow's Nest Pass to Fernie and [[Cranbrook, British Columbia|Cranbrook]], and the mountains became littered with collieries. By 1900, the CPR had purchased the smelter at [[Trail, British Columbia|Trail]] and sought to move Fernie coal around the Selkirk Mountains to Nelson and Trail.  When the CPR bought the smelter, it also bought the large mining company of [[Teck Cominco|Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company]] and their many properties in the Kootenays.\n\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway built a line from Lethbridge, Alberta, to a lakehead near [[Nelson, British Columbia]]; it opened in 1897. This line was built to develop coal deposits in the Elk River valley and help to assert Canadian (and CPR) sovereignty in an area into which U.S. railroads were beginning to build. CPR sought and received construction funding from the federal government, subject to a freight-subsidy arrangement for farm exports from the prairies; this came to be called the \"Crow's Nest Pass Agreement\". The tough lakeshore section around the Creston Mountains (from Creston to Nelson) was not built until 1927. Barges and lake steamers connected the railway.\n\n===Crow Rate===\n[[Image:The Empress Hotel.JPG|right|thumb|[[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] - [[The Empress (Hotel)|The Empress]]]]\nThe [[Crow Rate]] or \"Crow's Nest Freight Rate\" was a subsidy offered to the Canadian Pacific Railway by the Canadian government. The subsidy was instituted by an 1897 agreement between the CPR and the federal government. The purpose of the subsidy was to enable the CPR to expand westward over the Canadian Rockies through the Crow's Nest Pass, while reducing the transportation costs for farmers in the [[Canadian Prairies]]. In exchange for cash and perpetual title to the CPR over the lands which the railway would run, the CPR would reduce shipping rates for listed agricultural products \"forever\".\n\n===CP in the Kootenays===\nThe [[Columbia and Western Railway]] was a short-line, narrow-gauge railway running from the silver and gold mines at [[Red Mountain (Rossland)|Red Mountain]] and Rossland down the hill to the smelter at Trail. It was bought by the CPR in 1898 for its charter; this gave it the authority to build westward to Grand Forks. Here it connected to the part of the original Kettle Valley Railway between Grand Forks and Midway which had also been purchased by the CPR.  The Columbia and Western brought with it the smelter at Trail, which became the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company Limited (later Cominco Ltd).  The CPR also purchased the Columbia and Kootenay Railway and Navigation Company, which had a charter to construct a railway from Nelson to Robson (Castlegar, BC).  Another purchase was the charter for the BC Southern Railway, which authorized the construction of a railway from the Crow's Nest Pass to Nelson.  This line was initially constructed as far as the south end of Kootenay Lake at Kootenay Landing so through traffic had to transfer to a lake steamer and then reboard a second train for the final run into Nelson. The gap in the line from Kootenay Landing and Procter was not built until around 1932.\n\nThe [[Arrow Lakes]] route was accessible from the north, by a rail connection with the Canadian Pacific Railway at Revelstoke, where the CPR crosses the [[Columbia River]]. The CPR ran a spur line 30 miles south of Revelstoke to Arrowhead in 1891 to eliminate a stretch of difficult river navigation. The Arrow Lakes Route was also accessible from the south\u2014at Northport, Washington, (also on the Columbia River) where there was a rail connection. The Columbia River crosses the border near Boundary, Washington, which is about 749 miles from the mouth of the Columbia. Thus, via a combination of steamboat and railway connections, travel was eased by the CPR.\n\nThe CPR also built rail lines to [[Sandon, British Columbia|Sandon]]. The Nakusp and Slocan line went from Nakusp to Summit Lake, then down to Slocan Lake, past Rosebery, then up to Denver Canyon (New Denver). Then it drove up the hill along Carpenter Creek, to the mountainous mining town of Sandon. After the disastrous forest fire of 1911, the CPR bought the charred remains of the GN narrow gauge line [[Kaslo and Slocan Railway]] and rebuilt parts to standard gauge.  The CPR then ran lake steamers and rail-car barges to link these disconnected lines over the lakes\u2014from Kaslo to Nelson on Kootenay Lake; from Rosebery to Slocan City on Slocan Lake; and from Robson to Nakusp to Arrowhead (near Revelstoke) on the Arrow Lakes.  The CPR attempted to build a connecting line from Lardeau, past Poplar Meadow\u2014fifteen miles up the Lardeau River to Marblehead. Low traffic caused the line never to be finished to Trout Lake, Beaton and Arrowhead.\n\n===Building the Kettle Valley Railway===\n{{main|Kettle Valley Railway}}\n[[File:Myra Canyon Section of the Kettle Valley Railway August 2003.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Photograph of Myra Canyon Rail Bridge taken just days before it was destroyed by fire. August, 2003.]]\nThe CPR desired to have a second railway line across BC to service the rich farm, timber and mining lands in the Kootenays. It also wanted to lessen the impact of its rival [[Great Northern Railway (US)|Great Northern]], which had easy access to the area from low valleys in Washington state.  Through a long series of purchases, political machinations, lobbying, and due to the appearance of the GN, the Kettle Valley Railway was constructed from 1910 to 1915. The [[Kettle Valley Railway]] began at Hope and transited the Coquihalla Mountains to Brookmere, Tulameen, Princeton, Summerland, Penticton, Beaverdell and Midway.  An additional spur line from the junction at Brodie connected the line through [[Merritt, British Columbia]] to [[Spences Bridge, British Columbia]] on the CPR main line.  The Kettle Valley Railway operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of the CPR until it was absorbed by the CPR around 1937 as the Kettle Valley Division.\n\n===Lake steamers===\nThe CPR ran a fleet of lake steamers on the [[Arrow Lakes]], Kootenay and Slocan Lakes. They also had palatial ships on Okanagan Lake.\n\n===Coastal service in BC===\n{{main|CP Ships}}\nBCCS was established when the CPR acquired the Canadian Pacific Navigation Company (and its large fleet of ships serving 72 ports along the coast of British Columbia, including Vancouver Island) in 1901. Service included the Vancouver-Victoria-Seattle Triangle Route, Gulf Islands, Powell River and a Vancouver-Alaska service. BCCS operated a fleet of 14 passenger ships made up of a number of Princess ships (pocket versions of the ocean-going Empress ships), a freighter, three tugs and five rail-car barges. Popular with tourists, the Princess ships were famous in their own right\u2014especially the Princess Marguerite (II), which was the last coastal liner; it operated from 1949 until 1985. Three massive piers were built in Coal Harbour to service the boats\u2014CPR Piers A, B and C, and D. B and C has since been converted to Canada Place Pier. Other impressive docks were built in Victoria and Nanaimo.\n\n===Silk trains===\nBetween the 1890s and the 1940s, the CPR transported raw silk cocoons from Vancouver (where they had been shipped from the Orient) to silk mills in New York and New Jersey. A silk train could carry several million dollars worth of silk, and had its own armed guards. To avoid train robberies and minimize insurance costs, the silk trains traveled quickly and stopped only to change locomotives and crews (often done in under five minutes). The silk trains had right-of-way over all other trains; even passenger trains would be put in a siding to make the silk trains' trip faster.[[Image:Lake Louise 17092005.jpg|upright=1.25|thumb|The famous CPR hotel from the opposite shore of Lake Louise.]]\n\n===Expansion===\nThe CPR embarked on facilities expansion during the [[Edwardian era]].  Large service yards were built at Port Coquitlam, Drake Street, [[Coal Harbour]], and [[Cranbrook, British Columbia|Cranbrook]]. Small feeder lines were built, such as the Marpole Line from Drake Street to Eburne and then to Steveston. A bridge was built southwards across the Fraser River at Mission, and a line was constructed to connect with the US Lines at Huntington (named for [[Collis P. Huntington]], a US railway executive). The CP also built a hundred miles of rail down the [[Rocky Mountain]] trench from Golden to Creston, to more easily move heavy coal trains than over the winding and mountainous Kettle Valley Line. The coal was also needed on the main line for the steam engines. The [[Connaught Tunnel]] was built under [[Rogers Pass (British Columbia)|Rogers Pass]] in 1913 to reduce grades there. Spur lines were built to various profitable mines around the province\u2014to the Sullivan Mine at Kimberley, to copper mines at Phoenix, and south from Princeton to Allenby and Copper Mountain.  A spur was built south of Penticton to Osoyoos. Large steel bridges were raised across the Fraser River at Hope and across the Columbia River at Revelstoke. The CPR embarked on a real estate expansion in Vancouver; it sold blocks of land to real-estate companies, which sold them for housing. The CPR also started the [[Shaughnessy, Vancouver|Shaughnessy]] Heights project of upscale estates, on a knoll at South [[Granville Street]] overlooking the city.  Granville Street was established, and the finer residential suburb with curved streets, tree-lined avenues and strictly-controlled title deeds. The project did not sell as well as was hoped, due to the First World War and the Great Depression.\n\n===Competition===\n[[Image:Royal Canadian Pacific PC.jpg|thumb|x|upright=1.2|The Royal Canadian Pacific at [[Banff, Alberta|Banff]] station.]]\nThe CPR held a 25-mile monopoly on train service in BC from  1886; no competitor could work nearer its main line than that distance.  By 1910, there were other players who wished to repeat the success of the CPR\u2014the [[Grand Trunk Pacific Railway]] and the [[Canadian Northern Railway]]. Both lines arrived in BC but could not dislodge the CPR, which was firmly established in the southwest portion of the province.  The CPR was given the [[Peace River Block]] in a land swap for acreage in the south; these lands turned out to be very rich in oil and gas.\n\n===First World War===\nIts lines had been completed, and it had fleets of trains and ships; men, ships and machines were loaned to the war effort. Bridges and rail installations were guarded by Canadian troops. The CPR provided essential service moving men, food, and guns for the war. Railway shops were converted to shell factories.\n\n===Powerful engines===\n[[image:RockymountaineerView4017.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|CPR ascends the Rockies]]\nThe [[Selkirk locomotive]]s were 36 steam locomotives of the 2-10-4 wheel arrangement built for the Canadian Pacific Railway by [[Montreal Locomotive Works]] in Montreal. The first of these large engines with 2-10-4 wheel arrangement were built in July 1929. A total of twenty were constructed before the end of the year, bearing numbers 5900 to 5919. The Canadian Pacific Railway's classification was T1a. These locomotives weighed 375 short tons (340 t) fully loaded. They were the largest and most powerful non-articulated locomotives in the [[British Empire]]. The CPR also put on a crack train in the 1920s\u2014the Trans-Canada Limited. it was popular with Americans, as it was fast and it served alcohol (then illegal in the US).\n\n===Great Depression===\n[[Image:Hotel vanc 2007.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Hotel Vancouver]]]]\nThe [[Great Depression]], which lasted from 1929 until 1939, hit many companies heavily. While the CPR was affected, it was not crippled to the extent of its rival CNR because it (unlike the CNR) was debt-free.  The CPR continued building the tunnel under Dunsmuir Street in Vancouver, joining its passenger station at Granville with the Drake Street yards and separating freight trains and streetcar lines. The CPR scaled back on some of its passenger and freight services, and stopped issuing dividends to its shareholders after 1932. One highlight of the 1930s (both for the railway and for Canada) was the visit of [[King George VI]] and Queen Elizabeth to Canada in 1939\u2014the first time that the reigning monarch had visited the country in a Royal Tour. The CPR and the CNR shared the honours of pulling the royal train across the country, with the CPR undertaking the westbound journey from Quebec City to Vancouver. The CPR put semi-streamlined engines (among them [[Royal Hudson]] engine 2850) to the task of pulling the royal train.   \n[[Image:Canadian Pacific - Trans Canada passenger train.jpg|thumb|upright|CP passenger train heading east towards [[Calgary]] about 1973]]\n\n==Legacy==\nFor those living outside British Columbia, it is difficult to convey the extent that the CPR empire covered BC. The railroad changed the province; it owned (and dictated to) a large section of it. The CPR's empire became part of BC\u2014from the faux-Pict-Gothic-Palaces of its hotels, to its Tuscan-red cars and engines; from the CPR owning the center of town, to the CPR bloc establishing timber and mineral interests.  The clapboard section houses and water towers and rusty rails of spurs, the thousands of wooden wheat boxcars sitting at sidings with the arcing, powerful script announcing \"Canadian Pacific Railway\"\u2014all left an imprint.\n[[File:CPR Bronze Angel.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Bronze Angel memorial to CPR workers killed in WWI]]\n\nIn 1952, the CPR became the first North American railroad to introduce intermodal or \"piggyback\" freight service, where truck trailers are carried on flatcars. Containers later replaced most piggyback service. Beginning in the 1960s, the railroad started to discontinue much of its passenger service (particularly on its branch lines). Passenger service ended on its line through southern British Columbia and Crow's Nest Pass in January 1964. The Dominion was dropped in January 1966. On October 29, 1978, CP Rail transferred its passenger services to Via Rail, a new federal Crown corporation now responsible for intercity passenger services in Canada. Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney presided over major cuts in Via Rail service on January 15, 1990. This ended service by the ''[[Canadian (train)|Canadian]]'' over CPR rails, and the train was rerouted on the former ''[[Super Continental]]'' route via Canadian National without a change in name. Where both trains had been daily prior to the January 15, 1990 cuts, the surviving ''Canadian'' was (and is) a thrice-weekly operation.\n\nThe CPR was in a powerful position during the [[World War I|First World War]].\nCanadian Pacific Railway currently operates three commuter services under contract. The [[West Coast Express]] comprises ten daily trains running into downtown Vancouver on behalf of TransLink, a regional transit authority.  CNCP was created as a joint venture between Canadian Pacific Railway and Canadian National Railway in 1967, replacing the different networks used by the two companies. CN Telegraph interchanged traffic with the Postal Telegraph Cable Company in the US, while CPR Telegraphs networked with [[Western Union]]. The two networks\u2014former rivals\u2014had been cooperating increasingly since the 1930s. By 1980, CNCP was no longer a telegraph company and emerged as an early telecom company. A 40 percent stake was acquired by [[Rogers Communications]] in 1984, and CP acquired CN's stake. The network was dissolved in 1988, and Rogers renamed the company Unitel Communications Incorporated in 1989.\n\n[[Image:Glacier np canada.JPG|thumb|Rogers Pass]]\n\n==Other holdings==\nWith the empire came timber, oil, gas, coal, airlines, and real estate. Much of the postwar holdings were in these fields, and the railroad moved into bulk commodities\u2014wheat, potash, coal and sulfur.  By the 1970s, the advent of jet aircraft and national highways finished the passenger business.\n\nIn the 1980s and 90s the railway continued with traffic expansion.\nIt double tracked most of its mainline, where the mountains and valleys let it.\nA large tunnelling project under [[Mount MacDonald tunnel]] in Rogers Pass lowered the height the trains had to ascend to, and many rivetted bridges were replaced with\nheavier welded bridges. The Vancouver Intermodal Yard in Pitt Meadows opened in\n1996.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Canadian Museum of Rail Travel]]\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n\n*Barrie Sandford.

The [[British Columbia]] (BC) portion of the railway was constructed between 1881 and 1885, fulfilling a promise extended to BC when it entered [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] in 1871<ref>{{Cite book|last=Belshaw|first=John Douglas|title=Canadian History: Post-Confederation|publisher=BCcampus|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>. For decades, it was the only practical means of long\u2013distance [[passenger train|passenger transport]] in Canada.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Canadian Pacific 2816.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Canadian Pacific 2816]] ''Empress'' at [[Sturtevant, Wisconsin]], September 1, 2007]]\n\nThe Confederation League (which included such figures as [[Amor De Cosmos]], [[John Robson (politician)|John Robson]], and [[Robert Beaven]]) led the chorus pressing for the colony to join [[Canada]], which had been created out of three British North American colonies in 1867 (the [[Province of Canada]], [[Nova Scotia]] and [[New Brunswick]]). Several factors motivated this drive\u2014fear of annexation by the United States, overwhelming debt created by rapid population growth, the need for government-funded services to support this population, and the economic depression caused by the end of the gold rush. With the agreement by the Canadian government to extend the Canadian Pacific Railway to British Columbia and to assume the colony's debt, British Columbia became the sixth province to join Confederation on 20 July 1871. The borders of the province were not completely settled until 1903, however, when the province's territory shrank somewhat after the [[Alaska boundary dispute]] settled the vague boundary of the [[Alaska Panhandle]].\n\n==Construction==\n\n===The Pacific Scandal===\n[[Image:Hells Gate.jpg|thumb|right|Hells Gate\u2014CPR tracks by birch trees lower right; highway upper left]]\n\n[[Sir John A. Macdonald]]'s government fell in 1873 due to [[Pacific Scandal|corruption in railway contracts]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cpconnectingcanada.ca/our-history/|title=Connecting Canada|website=cpconnectingcanada.ca|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>. [[Alexander Mackenzie (politician)|Alexander Mackenzie]] succeeded Macdonald as [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] and embarked on a very slow building process in [[Manitoba]]. At this time there was also a severe financial depression, due to the [[Credit Mobilier scandal]] and the building of the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] in the US.  Also at this time, the government of Canada embarked on many surveys across the [[Rocky Mountains]] searching for the best route. Half a dozen routes were investigated, among them [[Pine Pass]], Rocky Mountain Canyon, Yellowhead and Kootenay Crossing. These myriad surveys took time, effort and money\u2014money which would have been better spent on just one or two surveys.\n\nMacdonald returned to power in 1878 and truly began to get on with the job of the railway. The government of Canada contracted with [[Andrew Onderdonk]] to build a railway two hundred miles from [[Port Moody]] on the Pacific tidewater to Savona's Ferry, some thirty miles west of modern [[Kamloops]]. Public Works Minister [[Sir Sandford Fleming]] had chosen the [[Fraser Canyon]] route with its fearsome Hell's Gate torrent, steep granite chasms, winding valleys and rockfalls. Other surveys had been conducted down [[Bute Inlet]], Dean Channel, [[Howe Sound]] and Harrison Lake but were found wanting. Fleming favoured the [[Yellowhead Pass]] as the best route. At any rate, the blasting and tunnelling through the tortuous Pacific Cascade Mountains would take half-a-dozen years, and the route could drive from Kamloops to Jasper after Onderdonk's crews had finished.\n\n===Canadian Pacific Railway===\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway Bill was approved by the House of Commons, and in February 1881 the company came into existence. It agreed to build the railway in exchange for $25,000,000 (approximately $625,000,000 in modern Canadian dollars) in credit from the Canadian government and a grant of {{convert|25,000,000|acre|km2}} of land<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Canadian-Pacific-Railway-Ltd|title=Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. {{!}} Canadian company|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>. The government transferred to the new company those sections of the railway it had constructed. The government also defrayed the cost of surveying, and exempted the railway from property taxes for 20 years. The Montreal-based syndicate officially consisted of five men\u2014George Stephen, James J. Hill, Duncan McIntyre, Richard B. Angus, and John Stewart Kennedy. Donald A. Smith and Norman Kittson were unofficial silent partners with a significant financial interest.\n\n===Chinese workers===\n[[Image:Hell's Gate, British Columbia 2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|View of Hell's Gate looking across to east bank, w. CPR steam locomotive in background passing old railway housing, c.1945]]\n[[Image:Canadian steam.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Engine 374, the first passenger train to arrive in Vancouver on the transcontinental railway in 1886.]]\n\nDue to a shortage of workers, Onderdonk contracted labour agents in [[Kowloon]] to supply six thousand Chinese [[coolies]] for the project. The province was outraged at the mass transfer of labour and \"Asiatics\", fearing that both  would upset the white Anglo-Saxon classes in ''British'' Columbia. Macdonald ceded to Onderdonk, due to the savings in labour costs.  BC at the time only had a population of two or three thousand Europeans\u2014not nearly enough to build such a large project.  Macdonald quipped that BC could either have Chinese workers and a railway, or no Chinese workers and no railway. Historians estimate he brought in a total of 15 000 Chinese from China and from California<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/canadian-pacific-railway|title=Canadian Pacific Railway {{!}} The Canadian Encyclopedia|website=www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>. Chinese workers were kept on crews separate from the white workers and often given the most dangerous jobs, including tunnel-blasting using highly unstable nitroglycerin. Many Chinese laborers were killed in accidents or died of scurvy during the winter, though part of the blame for the scurvy deaths lay with the workers' reliance on rice as a staple. Unlike white workers, injured Chinese workers were not given access to the company hospital and were abandoned to the rest of the workers for help. Discrimination and racism led to fights between Chinese and white workers, including white foremen of Chinese crews.  Chinese workers were generally seen by management as efficient, hardworking and well-behaved.\nThe Chinese crews worked year-round in the cliffs and forests, leveling grades. [[Navvy|Navvies]] received between $1 and $2.50 per day but had to pay for their own food, clothing, transportation to the job site, mail and medical care. After two-and-a-half months of back-breaking labour, they could net as little as $16. Chinese navvies in British Columbia made only between $0.75 and $1.25 a day (not including expenses), leaving hardly anything to send home. They did the most dangerous construction jobs. The families of the Chinese who were killed received no compensation\u2014not even notification of loss of life. Many of the men who survived did not have enough money to return to their families in China and spent years in lonely, sad and (often) poor conditions.\n\n===Michael Haney===\nOnderdonk engaged Irishman [[Michael James Haney]], a superior foreman. Haney saw the problem of the rivers, gorges, and cliffs and realized that Onderdonk would need extensive [[Trestle bridge|bridging]].  To solve this problem, Haney built a [[steam-power]]ed [[sawmill]] at [[Haney, British Columbia|Haney]] to cut standardized [[timber]]s. Crews also cut bridge [[Bent (structural)|bents]] ([[Framing (construction)|framework]] [[Stiffening#Mechanics|reinforcements]]), so the advance crews only had to submit measurements to Haney and he would custom-build a [[woodwork]] for that [[mile marker]] of track.  The prime [[Douglas fir]] of the [[Fraser Valley]] provided ideal timber. Lumber for ties was also cut at [[Texas Creek (Fraser River)|Texas Creek]], and timber was cut at the [[Chehalis River (British Columbia)|Chehalis River]] near [[Kilby Provincial Park|Kilby]]. Other crews were engaged around the province cutting and squaring [[Cross tie (railroad)|crosstiea]] by the million.\n\n===1885: the critical year===\n[[Image:Big Hill CPR.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Looking west, 1890. Safety Switch No. 1 and its uphill spur are shown foreground and right; the [[truss bridge]] under the rear of the train, now known as the \"Old Bridge\", survives as a tourist attraction]]\n[[Image:Power exits Lower Spiral.jpg|thumb|left|Lower portal of \"Number Two\" tunnel, Spiral Tunnels, Field, British Columbia. The locomotives are passing under the train they are pulling.]]\nThe ongoing cost of construction crews, crossing mountains, rivers and the [[Canadian Shield]] completely undid construction estimates and the CPR was nearly bankrupt in 1885. To prevent financial ruin CPR crews stopped building in masonry and steel,  opting for tree-pole construction with bridge trestles built from nearby trees.  Snowsheds, easy routings and sidings were omitted to reduce costs. Only the intervention of Lord Revelstoke of [[Barings Bank]] of London with another loan gave the CPR enough financing to finish the job. The greatest disadvantage of the route was in [[Kicking Horse Pass]]. In the first {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of the {{convert|1,625|m|ft|adj=mid|high}} summit, the Kicking Horse River drops {{convert|350|m|ft|0}}. The steep drop would force the cash-strapped CPR to build a {{convert|7|km|mi|adj=on}}-long stretch of track with a very steep 4.5% [[Grade (slope)|gradient]] when it reached the pass in 1884. This was over four times the maximum gradient recommended for railways of this era; even modern railways rarely exceed a 2% gradient. However, this route was far more direct than one through the [[Yellowhead Pass]] and saved hours for both passengers and freight. This section of track was the [[Big Hill]]. [[Safety]] [[Switch (railway)|switches]] were installed at several points, the speed limit for descending trains was set at {{convert|10|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} and special locomotives were ordered. Despite these measures, several serious [[Runaway train|runaways]] still occurred. CPR officials insisted that this was a temporary expediency, but this state of affairs would last for 25 years until the completion of the [[Big Hill#The Spiral Tunnels|Spiral Tunnels]] in the early 20th century.\n\n===Strike at Golden===\nMoney problems triggered a strike at a construction camp near Golden in March, 1885. Work crews had not been paid for months, and downed their tools. The [[North-West Mounted Police]] and company foremen attempted to calm the situation. Promises were made by the company which ameliorated the stalemate, and the crews went back to work.\n\n===Last spike===\n[[Image:The Last Spike Plaque.jpg|thumb|100px|A plaque commemorating the driving of the ''last spike'']]\nThe [[North-West Rebellion]] in [[District of Saskatchewan|Saskatchewan]] was quickly put down with troops travelling over the CPR. Perhaps because the government was grateful for this service, it subsequently reorganized the CPR's debt and provided a further $5,000,000 loan\u2014money which was desperately needed by the CPR. On November 7, 1885, the [[Last Spike (Canadian Pacific Railway)|Last Spike]] was driven at [[Craigellachie, British Columbia]], making good on the original promise. Four days earlier, the last spike of the [[Lake Superior]] section was driven just west of Jackfish, Ontario. While the railway was completed four years after the original 1881 deadline, it was completed more than five years ahead of the 1891 deadline issued by Macdonald in 1881.\n[[Image:Eastbound over SCB.jpg|thumb|200px|left|An eastbound CPR freight at [[Stoney Creek Bridge]] in [[Rogers Pass (British Columbia)|Rogers Pass]]. Photo by David R. Spencer.]]\n\n===Extension of the line from Port Moody===\nAfter the completion of the through line to [[Montreal]], Sir [[William Cornelius Van Horne]] looked at [[Port Moody]] and [[Burrard Inlet]] and decided to move the terminus to Gastown and [[False Creek]].  Land was secretly obtained from the provincial government and landowners to prevent speculation, and work crews extended the line 11 miles west to the [[City of Vancouver]]. [[Engine 374]] pulled the first passenger train into Vancouver on May 23, 1887; it was a banner year for the city.\n\nCanadian Pacific agents operated in many overseas locations. Immigrants were often sold a package that included passage on a CP ship, travel on a CP train, and land sold by the CP Railway priced at $2.50 an acre and up. Immigrants paid very little for a seven-day journey to the west. They rode in cars with sleeping facilities and a small kitchen at one end of each car. Children were not allowed off the train, lest they wander off and be left behind. The directors of the CPR knew that not only were they creating a nation, but also a long-term source of revenue for their company.\n\n==Since completion==\n\n===Founding of Vancouver===\n[[Vancouver]] was founded in 1886 as an adjunct to the arrival of the railway.  The CPR was given extensive lands in the Vancouver area\u2014the West End, lands west of Cambie Street, False Creek and the [[Dunbar-Southlands|Southlands]] area stretching to the Fraser River. Posh subdivisions were built, due to the railway's influence.  The Drake Street Roundhouse was built on False Creek, and [[Yaletown]] emerged. The City of Vancouver was incorporated on 6 April 1886, the year the first transcontinental train arrived. The name (honouring [[George Vancouver]]) was chosen by CPR president William Van Horne, who arrived in Port Moody to establish the CPR terminus recommended by Henry John Cambie. A massive \"slash burn\" (clearing fire) broke out of control on 13 June 1886, razing the entire city. It was quickly rebuilt, and the Vancouver Fire Department was established that same year.\n\n===Enter the CPR Pacific Steamers===\n[[Image:Empress of China 1891.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The Empress of China, 1891]]\n\nThe CPR chartered ocean steamers ''Batavia'', ''Abyssinia'' and ''Parthia'' to enter the China tea trade. The CPR then built their well-known Empress ships. The {{RMS|Empress of China}} began liner service in 1891.\n\n===Profitability===\nThe completion of the line and extension of the steamers put the railway in the black. From this, it began a program of infrastructure upgrades; the temporary [[Trestle bridge|trestles]] were changed to stone and steel. Snowsheds were built, as were rail yards, spurs, coalsheds and watertowers. The CPR sought cargo for its trains\u2014lumber from the Hastings mill, fish from [[Steveston]], fruit from the [[Okanagan]], minerals from the Kootenays and immigrants from Europe.  With this in mind, the railway expanded with spurs to the Okanagan, the [[Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway]], and a southern link from [[Port Coquitlam]] to [[New Westminster]] and Eburne.\n\n===Various disasters===\nWhile the CPR was doing well on the financial front, heavy slides in the Rogers Pass would often close the line in the month of March. Crews were dispatched to the area to shovel snow, which worked until 1910 when another slide came down on a work crew. Rains in 1894 washed out bridges and rail lines in a number of places. The line also had ongoing trouble with the Big Hill, including  several [[runaway train]]s.\n[[Image:Vancouver Waterfront Station.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|Waterfront Station in [[Vancouver]].]]\n\n===Turn of the century===\nBy the turn of the 20th century, the railway was a going concern and made its mark on the world stage.  Major hotels were begun, such as the [[The Empress (hotel)|Empress Hotel]] in Victoria, the [[Second Hotel Vancouver]], Glacier House, the [[Banff Springs Hotel]] and [[Chateau Lake Louise]].  Heavier railway equipment was built and ordered to keep up with the increased tonnage, and with the heavier trains came heavier bridges.  One ongoing problem was the onerous grade up the Kicking Horse Pass. The heavy trains needed batteries of engines to get over the Big Hill.  From this the Spiral Tunnels evolved, and construction began to build the long tunnels under the mountains.\n\n===The Crow's Nest Pass===\nThe CP empire had driven south from [[Calgary]] in the 1890s to reach the coal mines of [[Lethbridge]]; also, a link was made to the US lines in [[Montana]]. From this, the CPR wanted to build a line to the rich coalfields of [[Fernie, British Columbia|Fernie]] over the Rocky Mountains in BC. A line was built from Alberta across the Crow's Nest Pass to Fernie and [[Cranbrook, British Columbia|Cranbrook]], and the mountains became littered with collieries. By 1900, the CPR had purchased the smelter at [[Trail, British Columbia|Trail]] and sought to move Fernie coal around the Selkirk Mountains to Nelson and Trail.  When the CPR bought the smelter, it also bought the large mining company of [[Teck Cominco|Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company]] and their many properties in the Kootenays.\n\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway built a line from Lethbridge, Alberta, to a lakehead near [[Nelson, British Columbia]]; it opened in 1897. This line was built to develop coal deposits in the Elk River valley and help to assert Canadian (and CPR) sovereignty in an area into which U.S. railroads were beginning to build. CPR sought and received construction funding from the federal government, subject to a freight-subsidy arrangement for farm exports from the prairies; this came to be called the \"Crow's Nest Pass Agreement\". The tough lakeshore section around the Creston Mountains (from Creston to Nelson) was not built until 1927. Barges and lake steamers connected the railway.\n\n===Crow Rate===\n[[Image:The Empress Hotel.JPG|right|thumb|[[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] - [[The Empress (Hotel)|The Empress]]]]\nThe [[Crow Rate]] or \"Crow's Nest Freight Rate\" was a subsidy offered to the Canadian Pacific Railway by the Canadian government. The subsidy was instituted by an 1897 agreement between the CPR and the federal government. The purpose of the subsidy was to enable the CPR to expand westward over the Canadian Rockies through the Crow's Nest Pass, while reducing the transportation costs for farmers in the [[Canadian Prairies]]. In exchange for cash and perpetual title to the CPR over the lands which the railway would run, the CPR would reduce shipping rates for listed agricultural products \"forever\".\n\n===CP in the Kootenays===\nThe [[Columbia and Western Railway]] was a short-line, narrow-gauge railway running from the silver and gold mines at [[Red Mountain (Rossland)|Red Mountain]] and Rossland down the hill to the smelter at Trail. It was bought by the CPR in 1898 for its charter; this gave it the authority to build westward to Grand Forks. Here it connected to the part of the original Kettle Valley Railway between Grand Forks and Midway which had also been purchased by the CPR.  The Columbia and Western brought with it the smelter at Trail, which became the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company Limited (later Cominco Ltd).  The CPR also purchased the Columbia and Kootenay Railway and Navigation Company, which had a charter to construct a railway from Nelson to Robson (Castlegar, BC).  Another purchase was the charter for the BC Southern Railway, which authorized the construction of a railway from the Crow's Nest Pass to Nelson.  This line was initially constructed as far as the south end of Kootenay Lake at Kootenay Landing so through traffic had to transfer to a lake steamer and then reboard a second train for the final run into Nelson. The gap in the line from Kootenay Landing and Procter was not built until around 1932.\n\nThe [[Arrow Lakes]] route was accessible from the north, by a rail connection with the Canadian Pacific Railway at Revelstoke, where the CPR crosses the [[Columbia River]]. The CPR ran a spur line 30 miles south of Revelstoke to Arrowhead in 1891 to eliminate a stretch of difficult river navigation. The Arrow Lakes Route was also accessible from the south\u2014at Northport, Washington, (also on the Columbia River) where there was a rail connection. The Columbia River crosses the border near Boundary, Washington, which is about 749 miles from the mouth of the Columbia. Thus, via a combination of steamboat and railway connections, travel was eased by the CPR.\n\nThe CPR also built rail lines to [[Sandon, British Columbia|Sandon]]. The Nakusp and Slocan line went from Nakusp to Summit Lake, then down to Slocan Lake, past Rosebery, then up to Denver Canyon (New Denver). Then it drove up the hill along Carpenter Creek, to the mountainous mining town of Sandon. After the disastrous forest fire of 1911, the CPR bought the charred remains of the GN narrow gauge line [[Kaslo and Slocan Railway]] and rebuilt parts to standard gauge.  The CPR then ran lake steamers and rail-car barges to link these disconnected lines over the lakes\u2014from Kaslo to Nelson on Kootenay Lake; from Rosebery to Slocan City on Slocan Lake; and from Robson to Nakusp to Arrowhead (near Revelstoke) on the Arrow Lakes.  The CPR attempted to build a connecting line from Lardeau, past Poplar Meadow\u2014fifteen miles up the Lardeau River to Marblehead. Low traffic caused the line never to be finished to Trout Lake, Beaton and Arrowhead.\n\n===Building the Kettle Valley Railway===\n{{main|Kettle Valley Railway}}\n[[File:Myra Canyon Section of the Kettle Valley Railway August 2003.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Photograph of Myra Canyon Rail Bridge taken just days before it was destroyed by fire. August, 2003.]]\nThe CPR desired to have a second railway line across BC to service the rich farm, timber and mining lands in the Kootenays. It also wanted to lessen the impact of its rival [[Great Northern Railway (US)|Great Northern]], which had easy access to the area from low valleys in Washington state.  Through a long series of purchases, political machinations, lobbying, and due to the appearance of the GN, the Kettle Valley Railway was constructed from 1910 to 1915. The [[Kettle Valley Railway]] began at Hope and transited the Coquihalla Mountains to Brookmere, Tulameen, Princeton, Summerland, Penticton, Beaverdell and Midway.  An additional spur line from the junction at Brodie connected the line through [[Merritt, British Columbia]] to [[Spences Bridge, British Columbia]] on the CPR main line.  The Kettle Valley Railway operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of the CPR until it was absorbed by the CPR around 1937 as the Kettle Valley Division.\n\n===Lake steamers===\nThe CPR ran a fleet of lake steamers on the [[Arrow Lakes]], Kootenay and Slocan Lakes. They also had palatial ships on Okanagan Lake.\n\n===Coastal service in BC===\n{{main|CP Ships}}\nBCCS was established when the CPR acquired the Canadian Pacific Navigation Company (and its large fleet of ships serving 72 ports along the coast of British Columbia, including Vancouver Island) in 1901. Service included the Vancouver-Victoria-Seattle Triangle Route, Gulf Islands, Powell River and a Vancouver-Alaska service. BCCS operated a fleet of 14 passenger ships made up of a number of Princess ships (pocket versions of the ocean-going Empress ships), a freighter, three tugs and five rail-car barges. Popular with tourists, the Princess ships were famous in their own right\u2014especially the Princess Marguerite (II), which was the last coastal liner; it operated from 1949 until 1985. Three massive piers were built in Coal Harbour to service the boats\u2014CPR Piers A, B and C, and D. B and C has since been converted to Canada Place Pier. Other impressive docks were built in Victoria and Nanaimo.\n\n===Silk trains===\nBetween the 1890s and the 1940s, the CPR transported raw silk cocoons from Vancouver (where they had been shipped from the Orient) to silk mills in New York and New Jersey. A silk train could carry several million dollars worth of silk, and had its own armed guards. To avoid train robberies and minimize insurance costs, the silk trains traveled quickly and stopped only to change locomotives and crews (often done in under five minutes). The silk trains had right-of-way over all other trains; even passenger trains would be put in a siding to make the silk trains' trip faster.[[Image:Lake Louise 17092005.jpg|upright=1.25|thumb|The famous CPR hotel from the opposite shore of Lake Louise.]]\n\n===Expansion===\nThe CPR embarked on facilities expansion during the [[Edwardian era]].  Large service yards were built at Port Coquitlam, Drake Street, [[Coal Harbour]], and [[Cranbrook, British Columbia|Cranbrook]]. Small feeder lines were built, such as the Marpole Line from Drake Street to Eburne and then to Steveston. A bridge was built southwards across the Fraser River at Mission, and a line was constructed to connect with the US Lines at Huntington (named for [[Collis P. Huntington]], a US railway executive). The CP also built a hundred miles of rail down the [[Rocky Mountain]] trench from Golden to Creston, to more easily move heavy coal trains than over the winding and mountainous Kettle Valley Line. The coal was also needed on the main line for the steam engines. The [[Connaught Tunnel]] was built under [[Rogers Pass (British Columbia)|Rogers Pass]] in 1913 to reduce grades there. Spur lines were built to various profitable mines around the province\u2014to the Sullivan Mine at Kimberley, to copper mines at Phoenix, and south from Princeton to Allenby and Copper Mountain.  A spur was built south of Penticton to Osoyoos. Large steel bridges were raised across the Fraser River at Hope and across the Columbia River at Revelstoke. The CPR embarked on a real estate expansion in Vancouver; it sold blocks of land to real-estate companies, which sold them for housing. The CPR also started the [[Shaughnessy, Vancouver|Shaughnessy]] Heights project of upscale estates, on a knoll at South [[Granville Street]] overlooking the city.  Granville Street was established, and the finer residential suburb with curved streets, tree-lined avenues and strictly-controlled title deeds. The project did not sell as well as was hoped, due to the First World War and the Great Depression.\n\n===Competition===\n[[Image:Royal Canadian Pacific PC.jpg|thumb|x|upright=1.2|The Royal Canadian Pacific at [[Banff, Alberta|Banff]] station.]]\nThe CPR held a 25-mile monopoly on train service in BC from  1886; no competitor could work nearer its main line than that distance.  By 1910, there were other players who wished to repeat the success of the CPR\u2014the [[Grand Trunk Pacific Railway]] and the [[Canadian Northern Railway]]. Both lines arrived in BC but could not dislodge the CPR, which was firmly established in the southwest portion of the province.  The CPR was given the [[Peace River Block]] in a land swap for acreage in the south; these lands turned out to be very rich in oil and gas.\n\n===First World War===\nIts lines had been completed, and it had fleets of trains and ships; men, ships and machines were loaned to the war effort. Bridges and rail installations were guarded by Canadian troops. The CPR provided essential service moving men, food, and guns for the war. Railway shops were converted to shell factories.\n\n===Powerful engines===\n[[image:RockymountaineerView4017.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|CPR ascends the Rockies]]\nThe [[Selkirk locomotive]]s were 36 steam locomotives of the 2-10-4 wheel arrangement built for the Canadian Pacific Railway by [[Montreal Locomotive Works]] in Montreal. The first of these large engines with 2-10-4 wheel arrangement were built in July 1929. A total of twenty were constructed before the end of the year, bearing numbers 5900 to 5919. The Canadian Pacific Railway's classification was T1a. These locomotives weighed 375 short tons (340 t) fully loaded. They were the largest and most powerful non-articulated locomotives in the [[British Empire]]. The CPR also put on a crack train in the 1920s\u2014the Trans-Canada Limited. it was popular with Americans, as it was fast and it served alcohol (then illegal in the US).\n\n===Great Depression===\n[[Image:Hotel vanc 2007.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Hotel Vancouver]]]]\nThe [[Great Depression]], which lasted from 1929 until 1939, hit many companies heavily. While the CPR was affected, it was not crippled to the extent of its rival CNR because it (unlike the CNR) was debt-free.  The CPR continued building the tunnel under Dunsmuir Street in Vancouver, joining its passenger station at Granville with the Drake Street yards and separating freight trains and streetcar lines. The CPR scaled back on some of its passenger and freight services, and stopped issuing dividends to its shareholders after 1932. One highlight of the 1930s (both for the railway and for Canada) was the visit of [[King George VI]] and Queen Elizabeth to Canada in 1939\u2014the first time that the reigning monarch had visited the country in a Royal Tour. The CPR and the CNR shared the honours of pulling the royal train across the country, with the CPR undertaking the westbound journey from Quebec City to Vancouver. The CPR put semi-streamlined engines (among them [[Royal Hudson]] engine 2850) to the task of pulling the royal train.   \n[[Image:Canadian Pacific - Trans Canada passenger train.jpg|thumb|upright|CP passenger train heading east towards [[Calgary]] about 1973]]\n\n==Legacy==\nFor those living outside British Columbia, it is difficult to convey the extent that the CPR empire covered BC. The railroad changed the province; it owned (and dictated to) a large section of it. The CPR's empire became part of BC\u2014from the faux-Pict-Gothic-Palaces of its hotels, to its Tuscan-red cars and engines; from the CPR owning the center of town, to the CPR bloc establishing timber and mineral interests.  The clapboard section houses and water towers and rusty rails of spurs, the thousands of wooden wheat boxcars sitting at sidings with the arcing, powerful script announcing \"Canadian Pacific Railway\"\u2014all left an imprint.\n[[File:CPR Bronze Angel.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Bronze Angel memorial to CPR workers killed in WWI]]\n\nIn 1952, the CPR became the first North American railroad to introduce intermodal or \"piggyback\" freight service, where truck trailers are carried on flatcars. Containers later replaced most piggyback service. Beginning in the 1960s, the railroad started to discontinue much of its passenger service (particularly on its branch lines). Passenger service ended on its line through southern British Columbia and Crow's Nest Pass in January 1964. The Dominion was dropped in January 1966. On October 29, 1978, CP Rail transferred its passenger services to Via Rail, a new federal Crown corporation now responsible for intercity passenger services in Canada. Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney presided over major cuts in Via Rail service on January 15, 1990. This ended service by the ''[[Canadian (train)|Canadian]]'' over CPR rails, and the train was rerouted on the former ''[[Super Continental]]'' route via Canadian National without a change in name. Where both trains had been daily prior to the January 15, 1990 cuts, the surviving ''Canadian'' was (and is) a thrice-weekly operation.\n\nThe CPR was in a powerful position during the [[World War I|First World War]].\nCanadian Pacific Railway currently operates three commuter services under contract. The [[West Coast Express]] comprises ten daily trains running into downtown Vancouver on behalf of TransLink, a regional transit authority.  CNCP was created as a joint venture between Canadian Pacific Railway and Canadian National Railway in 1967, replacing the different networks used by the two companies. CN Telegraph interchanged traffic with the Postal Telegraph Cable Company in the US, while CPR Telegraphs networked with [[Western Union]]. The two networks\u2014former rivals\u2014had been cooperating increasingly since the 1930s. By 1980, CNCP was no longer a telegraph company and emerged as an early telecom company. A 40 percent stake was acquired by [[Rogers Communications]] in 1984, and CP acquired CN's stake. The network was dissolved in 1988, and Rogers renamed the company Unitel Communications Incorporated in 1989.\n\n[[Image:Glacier np canada.JPG|thumb|Rogers Pass]]\n\n==Other holdings==\nWith the empire came timber, oil, gas, coal, airlines, and real estate. Much of the postwar holdings were in these fields, and the railroad moved into bulk commodities\u2014wheat, potash, coal and sulfur.  By the 1970s, the advent of jet aircraft and national highways finished the passenger business.\n\nIn the 1980s and 90s the railway continued with traffic expansion.\nIt double tracked most of its mainline, where the mountains and valleys let it.\nA large tunnelling project under [[Mount MacDonald tunnel]] in Rogers Pass lowered the height the trains had to ascend to, and many rivetted bridges were replaced with\nheavier welded bridges. The Vancouver Intermodal Yard in Pitt Meadows opened in\n1996.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Canadian Museum of Rail Travel]]\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n\n*Barrie Sandford.

Affected nations send military and scientific experts to monitor and study them; in the United States, US Army Colonel G.T. Weber recruits Banks and physicist Ian Donnelly to study the craft above Montana. On board, Banks and Donnelly make contact with two seven-limbed aliens, whom they call \"heptapods\"; Donnelly nicknames them [[Abbott and Costello]]. They both begin researching the aliens\u2019 written language of [[Logogram|complicated circular symbols]], sharing results with other nations. As Banks studies the language, she starts to have flashback-like visions of her daughter.\n\nWhen Banks is able to establish sufficient shared vocabulary to ask why the aliens have come, they answer: \"Offer weapon\". However, China translates this as \"Use weapon\", prompting it to break off communications, and other nations follow. Banks argues that the symbol interpreted as \"weapon\" might mean \"tool\", and that China's translation likely results from interacting with the aliens using [[Mahjong]], a highly competitive winner-take-all game.\n\nRogue soldiers plant a bomb in the Montana craft. Unaware, Banks and Donnelly re-enter the alien vessel, and the aliens give them an extremely complex message. Just before the bomb explodes, one of the aliens ejects Donnelly and Banks, knocking them unconscious. When they reawaken, the military is preparing to evacuate in case of retaliation, and the craft has moved out of reach.\n\nDonnelly discovers that the symbol for time is present throughout the message, and that the writing occupies exactly one-twelfth of the 3D space in which it is projected. Banks suggests that the full message is split among the twelve craft, and the aliens want all the nations to share what they learn.\n\nChina's General Shang issues an ultimatum to his local alien craft, demanding that it leave China within 24 hours. Russia, Pakistan and Sudan follow suit. Communications between the international research teams are terminated as worldwide panic sets in.\n\nBanks goes alone to the craft, and it sends down a transport pod. Abbott is dying from the explosion; Costello explains that they have come to help humanity, for in 3,000 years they will need humanity's help in return. Banks realises the \"weapon\" is their language, which changes humans' linear perception of time, [[flashforward|allowing them to experience \"memories\" of future events]]. Banks' visions of her daughter, Hannah, are revealed to actually be premonitions; her daughter will not be born until some time in the future.\n\nBanks returns to the camp as it is being evacuated and tells Donnelly that the alien language itself is the \"tool\". Reflecting the [[Linguistic relativity|Sapir\u2013Whorf hypothesis]] of how language shapes perception, those who master the language are able to perceive the future and past. She has a premonition of a United Nations event celebrating newfound unity following the alien arrival, in which Shang thanks her for having convinced him to call off the attack by calling his private number and reciting his wife's dying words: \"War doesn't make winners, only widows.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.scriptslug.com/assets/uploads/scripts/arrival-2016.pdf |title=Arrival Screenplay |last=Heisserer |first=Eric |date=20 August 2015 |website=Script Slug |page=125 |access-date=28 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the present, Banks steals CIA-agent Halpern's satellite phone, a rarity when phones have been confiscated on the base, and calls Shang's number to recite the words. The Chinese announce that they are standing down and release their twelfth piece of the message. The other countries follow suit, and the twelve craft depart.\n\nDuring the evacuation of the camp, Donnelly expresses his love for Banks. They talk about life choices and whether he would change them if he could see the future.

But after the release of ''[[Interstellar (film)|Interstellar]]'' in 2014, Heisserer and Villeneuve agreed that this would not work, and decided that the heptapods' gift would be what was \"there in front of us \u2026 the power of their language\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/arrival-ending-interstellar/ |title=How 'Interstellar' Changed the Ending of 'Arrival' |website=[[/Film]] |first=Angie |last=Han |date=February 16, 2017 |accessdate=February 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Linguistics===\nBoth the book and the screenwriting required the invention of a form of alien linguistics which recurs in the plot.

Affected nations send military and scientific experts to monitor and study them; in the United States, US Army Colonel G.T. Weber recruits Banks and physicist Ian Donnelly to study the craft above Montana. On board, Banks and Donnelly make contact with two seven-limbed aliens, whom they call \"heptapods\"; Donnelly nicknames them [[Abbott and Costello]]. They both begin researching the aliens\u2019 written language of [[Logogram|complicated circular symbols]], sharing results with other nations. As Banks studies the language, she starts to have flashback-like visions of her daughter.\n\nWhen Banks is able to establish sufficient shared vocabulary to ask why the aliens have come, they answer: \"Offer weapon\". However, China translates this as \"Use weapon\", prompting it to break off communications, and other nations follow. Banks argues that the symbol interpreted as \"weapon\" might mean \"tool\", and that China's translation likely results from interacting with the aliens using [[Mahjong]], a highly competitive winner-take-all game.\n\nRogue soldiers plant a bomb in the Montana craft. Unaware, Banks and Donnelly re-enter the alien vessel, and the aliens give them an extremely complex message. Just before the bomb explodes, one of the aliens ejects Donnelly and Banks, knocking them unconscious. When they reawaken, the military is preparing to evacuate in case of retaliation, and the craft has moved out of reach.\n\nDonnelly discovers that the symbol for time is present throughout the message, and that the writing occupies exactly one-twelfth of the 3D space in which it is projected. Banks suggests that the full message is split among the twelve craft, and the aliens want all the nations to share what they learn.\n\nChina's General Shang issues an ultimatum to his local alien craft, demanding that it leave China within 24 hours. Russia, Pakistan and Sudan follow suit. Communications between the international research teams are terminated as worldwide panic sets in.\n\nBanks goes alone to the craft, and it sends down a transport pod. Abbott is dying from the explosion; Costello explains that they have come to help humanity, for in 3,000 years they will need humanity's help in return. Banks realises the \"weapon\" is their language, which changes humans' linear perception of time, [[flashforward|allowing them to experience \"memories\" of future events]]. Banks' visions of her daughter, Hannah, are revealed to actually be premonitions; her daughter will not be born until some time in the future.\n\nBanks returns to the camp as it is being evacuated and tells Donnelly that the alien language itself is the \"tool\". Reflecting the [[Linguistic relativity|Sapir\u2013Whorf hypothesis]] of how language shapes perception, those who master the language are able to perceive the future and past. She has a premonition of a United Nations event celebrating newfound unity following the alien arrival, in which Shang thanks her for having convinced him to call off the attack by calling his private number and reciting his wife's dying words: \"War doesn't make winners, only widows.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.scriptslug.com/assets/uploads/scripts/arrival-2016.pdf |title=Arrival Screenplay |last=Heisserer |first=Eric |date=20 August 2015 |website=Script Slug |page=125 |access-date=28 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the present, Banks steals CIA-agent Halpern's satellite phone, a rarity when phones have been confiscated on the base, and calls Shang's number to recite the words. The Chinese announce that they are standing down and release their twelfth piece of the message. The other countries follow suit, and the twelve craft depart.\n\nDuring the evacuation of the camp, Donnelly expresses his love for Banks. They talk about life choices and whether he would change them if he could see the future. Banks knows that she will agree to have a child with him despite knowing their fate: that Hannah will die, and Donnelly will leave them after she reveals that she knew this.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Amy Adams]] as Louise Banks\n* [[Jeremy Renner]] as Ian Donnelly\n* [[Forest Whitaker]] as Colonel G.
