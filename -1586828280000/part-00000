As he gets a job in the USA, his parents Vasundhara ([[Suhasini]]) and Raj Gopal ([[Ashish Vidyarthi]]), who got married against their respective parents' wishes, ask him to get married. He accepts and tells them that he will marry a girl of their choice in a ceremony that lasts five days. He also refuses to see his bride until the marriage. Everything is arranged according to his wishes, and his marriage is fixed with Deepthi ([[Bhanu Sri Mehra]]). At the ceremony, when Sandy and Deepthi see each other, they fall in love at first sight. Deepthi gets kidnapped by a local goon named Diwakar ([[Arya (actor)|Arya]]). Sandy's family tries to convince him for another marriage, but he refuses and tries finding his bride. He gets to know Deepthi's whereabouts. Diwakar kidnapped Deepthi to take revenge from her as she slapped him for misbehaving with her in public. The police gets killed by Diwakar and his men.

Maynard was also featured alongside Butler in the music video for the same song.\n\nConor performed at the Hertfordshire Summer Ball on 13 May 2016, along with other acts such as Becky Hill.\n\nIn July 2016, due to the success of his covers on YouTube, Conor announced he would be releasing an album of covers with one original track. A few of the covers included \"Pillowtalk\", \"One Dance\", \"Hello\" and \"Stitches\". The original was called \"This Is My Version\" and was written about a relationship he had previously been in. The album, ''Covers'', was released on 5 August 2016.\n\nMaynard featured on a dance track called \"Dancing in the Headlights\" by [[DJ Antoine]].

He revealed that following the success of his debut album, he entered into a relationship and found it difficult to effectively split his time which resulted in the disappointing charting of ''[[Talking About]]'' and ''Royalty''. Maynard subsequently began making the majority of his income via online stream such as [[YouTube]] and [[Spotify]] as opposed to album sales and live performances. He then admitted that he wants to release a new album of original music online but is currently unable to because he is under contractual talks with his label. He also stated that once the situation is fixed he will be able to release original content.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14AtQGTNm6Q|title=Conor Maynard - ON FAME, LOGAN PAUL & HIS BROTHER'S SCANDAL (Honest Interview)|first=|last=Caspar|date=8 January 2018|accessdate=22 March 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

The single is extracted from his second upcoming album, which is predicted to be released at the beginning of 2016.\n\nOn 22 January 2016, the single \"[[I'm Famous]]\" by Marcus Butler was released featuring Maynard. It peaked at number 85 on the UK Singles Chart top 100, failing to reach the top 40.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/48966/marcus-butler-ft-conor-maynard/|title=MARCUS BUTLER FT CONOR MAYNARD - full Official Chart History - Official Charts Company|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2017}}</ref> The single spent only one week on the chart. Maynard was also featured alongside Butler in the music video for the same song.\n\nConor performed at the Hertfordshire Summer Ball on 13 May 2016, along with other acts such as Becky Hill.\n\nIn July 2016, due to the success of his covers on YouTube, Conor announced he would be releasing an album of covers with one original track. A few of the covers included \"Pillowtalk\", \"One Dance\", \"Hello\" and \"Stitches\". The original was called \"This Is My Version\" and was written about a relationship he had previously been in. The album, ''Covers'', was released on 5 August 2016.\n\nMaynard featured on a dance track called \"Dancing in the Headlights\" by [[DJ Antoine]]. Maynard also featured on a track called \"Catch Me Here\" by Drumsound and Bassline Smith which Conor had already written for 2 years. On 23 December 2016 he released the single \"Are You Sure?\" with [[Kris Kross Amsterdam]] featuring vocals from [[Ty Dolla Sign]].\n\nIn an interview on 8 January 2018 with [[Caspar Lee]], Maynard discussed the status of his new album. He revealed that following the success of his debut album, he entered into a relationship and found it difficult to effectively split his time which resulted in the disappointing charting of ''[[Talking About]]'' and ''Royalty''. Maynard subsequently began making the majority of his income via online stream such as [[YouTube]] and [[Spotify]] as opposed to album sales and live performances. He then admitted that he wants to release a new album of original music online but is currently unable to because he is under contractual talks with his label. He also stated that once the situation is fixed he will be able to release original content.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14AtQGTNm6Q|title=Conor Maynard - ON FAME, LOGAN PAUL & HIS BROTHER'S SCANDAL (Honest Interview)|first=|last=Caspar|date=8 January 2018|accessdate=22 March 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

The older two are married and the younger two unmarried. The older sister Tehreem is played by Sarwat Gillani who seems very much distressed at the hands of her husband but she does not express her pain in front of her family. In a cruel twist of faith, she dies in childbirth, leaving a newborn baby boy. Her husband Khawar, played by Faisal Qureshi appears extremely heartbroken at his wife's untimely demise. He mourns her for days, during which his guilty conscience reminds him of the time when he was so cruel and unreasonable with Tehreem. She literally had to walk on eggshells near her husband.\n\nHer baby boy now comes to the hands of her younger sister Takbeer (Madiha Imam) who loves him like his own. A little before Tehreem's death, she was engaged to Moosa, played by the very handsome Shahzad Noor who is her best friend's brother. They both were smitten with each other before engagement and were over the moon with happiness after it. Unfortunately, after Tehreem's death, their marriage is delayed and their conversations revolve around her son Ahmed. Takbeer and Moosa plan to keep him with themselves after marriage since she is the only mother he has ever known. Takbeer asks permission from Khawar to take his son with her when she gets married. This enrages Khawar so much that he snatches Ahmed and takes him away from Takbeer. She asks her father to stop him and he comes up with the solution that Takbeer should marry Khawar. He breaks her engagement with Moosa despite her and Farhan's pleas. Farhan is the youngest of all siblings and very upset at the unfairness of this decision.\n\nTheir father, played by Shabbir Jan does not change his decision, so Takbeer marries Khawar unwillingly. So far, the drama is very interesting and all the characters are really looking their part, though Shabbir Jan and Madiha Imam stand out among the lot. The story does have a few loopholes but as the relationship between Khawar and Tehreem wasn't elaborated at all. The only thing that remains clear is Tehreem's unhappiness. The way Khawar mourned her death also seemed out of place, given his mistreatment towards her in her life. I think the reason for Khawar's behaviour and his issues will be clarified in later episodes. Takbeer has also done herself no favours. In her naivety and her love for her sister's child, she forgot that it's unrealistic to expect a father to let of his child just like that. She was the one who brought to light this whole issue of taking away Khawar's son to her husband's home. That brought upon the decision Shabbir  Jan took that will start a new set of difficulties for all of them. The decision per se was not illogical but considering the romantic involvement between Takbeer and Moosa, it was disastrous.\nAnother unclear lead is how Khawar and her sister for that matter agreed to it, despite being reminded repeatedly of Takbeer's love for Moosa. Is it just selfishness on the part of Khawar for his son's sake or some other psychological illness that made him marry her despite such clear indications that she loves someone else dearly. Takbeer's mother and bhabi proved totally useless in helping her except shedding a few sorry tears as she was wedded off against her will.\n\nAnother very typical character is Khawar's sister who despite being a woman and knowing her brother's personality expects his wives to cater to his every whim happily. Her dialogue, \"HUM TOH KHUSHI SAY AYAY HAIN, YAHAN TOH RONA DHONA CHAL RAHA HAI\" was so insensitive, as if she couldn't believe how could a girl not be jumping with joy at being married to her nutcase of a brother.\nTakbeer, on the other hand is determined to fight back every violence. The exchange between father and daughter at the end was poignant but both were lost in their own worlds, couldn't reach out to each other in any way.\nWatch all episodes\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Madiha Imam (actress)|Madiha Imam]] as Takbeer<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dramasvideo.site/tag/zakham-new-drama-cast|title=Zakham New Drama Cast|publisher=Dramasvideo.site|date=6 May 2017|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Faysal Qureshi (actor)|Faysal Qureshi]] as Khawar\n* [[Sarwat Gilani]] as Tehreem (Takbeer's elder sister and Khawar's first wife)\n* [[Shahzad Noor]] as Moosa\n* [[Shabbir Jan]] as Tehreem and Takbeer's father\n* Ismat Iqbal as Zeb (Takbeer's mother)\n* Fahim Abbas as Sultaan (Takbeer's elder brother)\n* Mariam Mirza as Rashda\n* Mehwish Qureshi as Farhat (Sultan's wife)\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of programs broadcast by ARY Digital]]\n* [[2017 in Pakistani television]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website|http://www.arydigital.tv/zakham-ary-digital-exclusive-drama/}}\n* {{Facebook|Zakham.Official}}\n\n[[Category:2010s Pakistani television series]]\n[[Category:2017 Pakistani television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2017 Pakistani television series endings]]\n[[Category:ARY Digital television series]]\n[[Category:ARY Digital]]\n[[Category:Pakistani drama television series]]\n[[Category:Urdu-language television programs]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2017}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name            = Zakham\n| image                =\n| image_alt            = \n| caption              = \n| genre                = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Drama]]\n* [[Romance film|Romantic]]\n}}\n| writer               = Sameena Ejaz\n| director             = Ali Faizan\n| starring             = {{Plainlist|\n* Madiha Imam\n* [[Faysal Qureshi (actor)|Faysal Qureshi]]\n* [[Sarwat Gilani]]\n* [[Shahzad Noor]]\n*[[Madiha Imam (actress)|Madiha Imam]]\n}}\n| theme_music_composer = \n| opentheme            = \n| endtheme             = \n| composer             = \n| country              = [[Pakistan]]\n| language             = [[Urdu]]\n| num_seasons          = 1\n| num_episodes         = 26\n| list_episodes        = \n| executive_producer   = \n| producer             = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Fahad Mustafa]]\n* Dr. [[Ali Kazmi]]\n}}\n| camera               = \n| runtime              = 35 minutes\n| company              = [[Big Bang Entertainment]]\n| distributor          = [[ARY Digital]]\n| network              = [[ARY Digital]]\n| picture_format       = {{Plainlist|\n* [[576i]]\n* [[HDTV]] [[1080i]]\n}}\n| audio_format         = [[Stereo]]\n| first_aired          = 6 May 2017\n| last_aired           = 31 August 2017\n| website              = http://www.arydigital.tv/zakham-ary-digital-exclusive-drama/\n| production_website   = \n}}\n'''Zakham ''' (English: Wound) is a [[Pakistani drama]] series produced by Fahad Mustafa and Dr. Ali Kazmi, directed by Ali Faizan and written by Sameena Ejaz.

During the American Civil War he spent some time at [[Wilmington, Delaware]], but moved to England in 1869, after the death of his father. He was schooled at [[Cranleigh School]] where he was a noted scholar and athlete.

This allowed the production of images that, especially in early days, could not have been produced indoors in low light, and it also made possible the creation of highly dramatic images, often in imitation of allegorical paintings. Emerson denounced this technique as false and claimed that photography should be seen as a genre of its own, not one that seeks to imitate other art forms.\n\nAll Emerson's own pictures were taken in a single shot and without [[retouching]], which was another form of manipulation that he strongly disagreed with, calling it \"the process by which a good, bad, or indifferent photograph is converted into a bad drawing or painting\".<ref name=LEG />\n[[File:Peter Henry Emerson - The Poacher - A Hare in View - Google Art Project.jpg|alt=the hunters, ph emerson, a hare in view, photography|thumb|402x402px|This is a photo from Emerson's album \"The Hunters\" depicting a hunter and his dog sourced from Nancy Newhall's book \"P.H.

{"title_page": "Benevolence (tax)", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2020}}\n{{Use British English|date=March 2020}}\n\nA '''benevolence''', also called a '''loving contribution''', '''voluntary contribution''' or '''free gift''', was a type of tax imposed by several [[English monarchs]] from the 15th to 17th centuries. Although taken under the guise of a charitable contribution to the king, the money was in fact extorted from the king's subjects. Commissioners or letters were sent from town to town, detailing the financial need of the king and asking that the town's wealthiest pay up. The requested could not refuse to give, unless they denied the king's need or professed their own poverty, a \"doubtless difficult, if not virtually impossible\" task.{{sfn|Chrimes|1972|p=202}} Benevolences allowed the king to raise money outside of [[Parliament of England|Parliament]], which traditionally had to authorise any tax the king proposed.\n\nA benevolence was first imposed in 1473 by [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]]. It ended lucratively for the king, and he made similar demands leading up to the [[English invasion of Scotland (1482)|1482 invasion of Scotland]] which yielded yet more for the royal coffers. Despite this, the benevolences were extremely unpopular and gained Edward a \"reputation for avarice\". [[Richard III]] attempted to make similar exactions, but met with stringent condemnations of the taxes from Parliament which described them as unjust and unprecedented impositions. Richard's benevolences were not carried out and Parliament ultimately outlawed the practice in 1484.\n\nRichard's deposer [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] freely sidestepped these statutes in imposing a benevolence in 1491. His actions were supported by Parliament, although not by the whole populace, and earned him \u00a348,000. [[Henry VIII]] levied yet more benevolences in 1525 and 1545: the first ending in rebellion and withdrawal, and the second ending with a profit of \u00a3120,000. During [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s half-century long reign, benevolences were only raised a few times in the 1580s and 1590s, and then only to small subsets of the population, and raising small amounts. Benevolences had grown increasingly unpopular, criticised by contemporary writers to the ire of Elizabeth's government. The last benevolence of the [[Tudor period]] was levied in 1599.\n\nBenevolences were revived when [[James I]], meeting with an obstinate Parliament, used them to augment his treasury extra-Parliamentarily in 1614. This proved successful, but a further benevolence in 1620 to support [[Frederick V of the Palatinate]] did not, forcing James to call Parliament the following year. No further benevolences were collected, though both James and his son [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] took preliminary steps to implement them during their reigns.\n\n==Exaction==\nBenevolences were exacted from the public by methods essentially the same as those of forced loans. Commissioners, typically [[gentlemen]], would travel from town to town supplied with rationales for the benevolence, often relating to the safety of the kingdom, and approach the men of the town to hear this justification and ask for a gift. Alternatively, letters under the monarch's authority were sent to the town's wealthiest individuals emphasising this danger. Benevolences were usually put forth as an alternative to military service in a time of crisis, the subject obliged to help the king in other ways.

Although taken under the guise of a charitable contribution to the king, the money was in fact extorted from the king's subjects. Commissioners or letters were sent from town to town, detailing the financial need of the king and asking that the town's wealthiest pay up. The requested could not refuse to give, unless they denied the king's need or professed their own poverty, a \"doubtless difficult, if not virtually impossible\" task.{{sfn|Chrimes|1972|p=202}} Benevolences allowed the king to raise money outside of [[Parliament of England|Parliament]], which traditionally had to authorise any tax the king proposed.\n\nA benevolence was first imposed in 1473 by [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]]. It ended lucratively for the king, and he made similar demands leading up to the [[English invasion of Scotland (1482)|1482 invasion of Scotland]] which yielded yet more for the royal coffers. Despite this, the benevolences were extremely unpopular and gained Edward a \"reputation for avarice\". [[Richard III]] attempted to make similar exactions, but met with stringent condemnations of the taxes from Parliament which described them as unjust and unprecedented impositions. Richard's benevolences were not carried out and Parliament ultimately outlawed the practice in 1484.\n\nRichard's deposer [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] freely sidestepped these statutes in imposing a benevolence in 1491. His actions were supported by Parliament, although not by the whole populace, and earned him \u00a348,000. [[Henry VIII]] levied yet more benevolences in 1525 and 1545: the first ending in rebellion and withdrawal, and the second ending with a profit of \u00a3120,000. During [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s half-century long reign, benevolences were only raised a few times in the 1580s and 1590s, and then only to small subsets of the population, and raising small amounts. Benevolences had grown increasingly unpopular, criticised by contemporary writers to the ire of Elizabeth's government. The last benevolence of the [[Tudor period]] was levied in 1599.\n\nBenevolences were revived when [[James I]], meeting with an obstinate Parliament, used them to augment his treasury extra-Parliamentarily in 1614. This proved successful, but a further benevolence in 1620 to support [[Frederick V of the Palatinate]] did not, forcing James to call Parliament the following year. No further benevolences were collected, though both James and his son [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] took preliminary steps to implement them during their reigns.\n\n==Exaction==\nBenevolences were exacted from the public by methods essentially the same as those of forced loans. Commissioners, typically [[gentlemen]], would travel from town to town supplied with rationales for the benevolence, often relating to the safety of the kingdom, and approach the men of the town to hear this justification and ask for a gift. Alternatively, letters under the monarch's authority were sent to the town's wealthiest individuals emphasising this danger. Benevolences were usually put forth as an alternative to military service in a time of crisis, the subject obliged to help the king in other ways. Legally these contributions were considered voluntary, but in practice subjects usually could not refuse once asked, but rather could haggle with the commissioner over how much they would give.{{sfn|Braddick|1996|pp=84-85}} The only way to escape the obligation would be to deny the necessity,{{sfn|Braddick|1996|p=85}} or plead poverty,{{sfn|Harriss|1963|p=17}} a task which was\u2014as one historian has put it\u2014\"doubtless difficult, if not virtually impossible\".{{sfn|Chrimes|1972|p=202}}\n\n==Late medieval invention: 1473\u201384==\n[[File:King Edward IV.jpg|thumb|[[Edward IV]] (r. 1461\u201383) was the first English king to impose benevolences.]]\nAccording to English medievalist [[G.

This met with opposition\u2014one contemporary pamphlet reported the populace not only opposed it on the basis of their own poverty but the laws of Edward IV, which they still upheld\u2014but managed to bring in over \u00a3116,000{{efn-lr|\u00a3116,000 in 1622 equates to approximately \u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|116000|1622|r=-5}}|0}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}, according to calculations based on [[retail price index]] measure of inflation.{{inflation-fn|UK}}}} in total, almost as substantial as the funds Parliament had raised the previous year.{{sfn|Dietz|1964b|p=194}}\n\nAfter this, no further benevolences were collected, though they were proposed two more times near the end of James' reign, in 1622 and 1625.<ref name=EB11/> In 1633, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] allowed diplomat [[Francis Nethersole]] to collect a benevolence on behalf of the recently widowed wife of Frederick V, [[Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia|Elizabeth Stuart]], but an ensuing dispute between Nethersole and one of the king's in-laws caused the plans to be abandoned.{{sfn|White|2016|p=84}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n===Inflation notes===\n{{notelist-lr}}\n\n===Explanatory notes===\n{{notelist}}\n\n===References===\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Boyer |first=Allen D. |date=2003 |title=Sir Edward Coke and the Elizabethan Age |publisher=Stanford University Press |location=Stanford, CA |isbn=978-0-8047-4809-4 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lkEv6eccC44C |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book |last=Braddick |first=Michael J. |date=1996 |title=The Nerves of State: Taxation and the Financing of the English State, 1558-1714 |series=New Frontiers in History |publisher=Manchester University Press |location=Manchester |isbn=978-0-7190-3871-6 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&lr=&id=iH-7AAAAIAAJ |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite journal |last=Bush |first=Michael |date=October 1991 |title= Tax Reform and Rebellion in Early Tudor England  |journal=[[History (journal)|History]] |volume=76 |issue=248 |pages=379-400 |jstor=24421380 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-229X.1991.tb01539.x |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book |last=Bush |first=Michael |date=2009 |title=The Pilgrims' Complaint: A Study of Popular Thought in the Early Tudor North |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |series=Catholic Christendom, 1300-1700 |isbn=978-0-7546-6785-8 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Pilgrims_Complaint.html?id=OHx4jL8M6YEC |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book |last=Chrimes |first=S.
