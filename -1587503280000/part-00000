The Janata alliance, with [[Jai Prakash Narayan]] as its spiritual guide, claimed the elections were the last chance for India to choose between \"democracy and dictatorship\". The Congress Party split during the election campaign of 1977: veteran Gandhi supporters like [[Jagjivan Ram]], [[Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna]] and [[Nandini Satpathy]] were compelled to part ways and form a new political entity, the CFD ([[Congress for Democracy]]), due primarily to intra-party politicking and the circumstances created by Sanjay Gandhi. The prevailing rumour was that he intended to dislodge Gandhi, and the trio stood to prevent that. Gandhi's Congress party was soundly crushed in the elections. The Janata Party's democracy or dictatorship claim seemed to resonate with the public. Gandhi and Sanjay Gandhi lost their seats, and Congress was reduced to 153 seats (compared with 350 in the previous Lok Sabha), 92 of which were in the South. The Janata alliance, under the leadership of Morarji Desai, came to power after the State of Emergency was lifted.

The main reason was the perceived bias of the United States and [[China]], rivals of USSR, towards Pakistan. The support of the Soviets with arms supplies and the casting of a veto at United Nations helped in winning and consolidating the victory over Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war. Before the war, Gandhi signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviets. They were unhappy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing Cold War with the United States. Indira was unhappy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept her from criticising the Soviet Union harshly. The Soviets became the main arms supplier during the Gandhi years by offering cheap credit and transactions in rupees rather than in dollars. The easy trade deals also applied to non-military goods. Under Gandhi, by the early 1980s, the Soviets had become India's largest trading partner.<ref name=\"British Academic Press\">{{cite book|last1=Light|first1=Margot (Editor)|last2=Duncan|first2=Peter J.S.

Gandhi not only abandoned the short lived liberalization programme but also aggressively expanded the public sector with new licensing requirements and other restrictions for industry. She began a new course by launching the Fourth Five-Year Plan in 1969.

The main reason was the perceived bias of the United States and [[China]], rivals of USSR, towards Pakistan. The support of the Soviets with arms supplies and the casting of a veto at United Nations helped in winning and consolidating the victory over Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war. Before the war, Gandhi signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviets. They were unhappy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing Cold War with the United States. Indira was unhappy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept her from criticising the Soviet Union harshly. The Soviets became the main arms supplier during the Gandhi years by offering cheap credit and transactions in rupees rather than in dollars. The easy trade deals also applied to non-military goods. Under Gandhi, by the early 1980s, the Soviets had become India's largest trading partner.<ref name=\"British Academic Press\">{{cite book|last1=Light|first1=Margot (Editor)|last2=Duncan|first2=Peter J.S.

Gandhi not only abandoned the short lived liberalization programme but also aggressively expanded the public sector with new licensing requirements and other restrictions for industry.

In 1975, Gandhi declared the state of [[Jammu and Kashmir (state)|Jammu and Kashmir]] as a constituent unit of India. The Kashmir conflict remained largely peaceful if frozen under Gandhi's premiership.<ref>{{cite book|first=Jayanta|last=Kumar Ray|title=Aspects of India's International Relations, 1700 to 2000: South Asia and the World|location=|publisher=Pearson|year=2007|page=493|isbn=978-8131708347}}</ref>\n\nIn 1972, Gandhi granted statehood to [[Meghalaya]], [[Manipur]] and [[Tripura]], while the [[North-East Frontier Agency]] was declared a union territory and renamed [[Arunachal Pradesh]].

She argued the case for abolition based on equal rights for all citizens and the need to reduce the government's revenue deficit. The nobility responded by rallying around the [[Bharatiya Jana Sangh|Jana Sangh]] and other right-wing parties that stood in opposition to Gandhi's attempts to abolish royal privileges.<ref name=\"Jaffrelot\"/> The motion to abolish privy purses, and the official recognition of the titles, was originally brought before the [[Parliament of India|Parliament]] in 1970. It was passed in the [[Lok Sabha]] but felt short of the two-thirds majority in the [[Rajya Sabha]] by a single vote.{{sfn|Jayakar|1997|p=214}} Gandhi responded by having a [[Presidential proclamation]] issued; de-recognizing the princes; with this withdrawal of recognition, their claims to privy purses were also legally lost.{{sfn|Jayakar|1997|p=214}} However, the proclamation was struck down by the [[Supreme Court of India]].{{sfn|Jayakar|1997|p=214}} In 1971, Gandhi again motioned to abolish the privy purse. This time, it was successfully passed as the [[List of amendments of the Constitution of India|26th Amendment to the Constitution of India]].<ref name=\"Jaffrelot\"/> Many royals tried to protest the abolition of the privy purse, primarily through campaigns to contest seats in elections.

The political economist, Jyotindra Das Gupta, cryptically questioned \"...whether or not the real supporters of land-holders were in jail or in power?\"<ref name=\"Jaffrelot\"/> Critics also accused Gandhi of choosing to \"talk left and act right\", referring to her concurrent pro-business decisions and endeavours.<ref name=\"Jaffrelot\"/> [[J.

This was not acceptable to many non-Hindi speaking states, who wanted the continued use of English in government.

His novels, especially later ones, incorporate many excerpts from newspapers, magazines and other political sources as a way to enlighten the people about a certain political or social issue. Because of his political opinions he was imprisoned during the 1960s; his imprisonment is featured in his first book, ''That Smell'' (\u062a\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0627\u0626\u062d\u0629), which was one of the first writings in [[Egyptian literature]] to adopt a modernist tinge.\n\nIn harmony with his political ideas, in 2003 he refused to accept a prestigious literary award worth 100,000 [[Egyptian pound]]s from Egypt's [[Ministry of Culture (Egypt)|Ministry of Culture]].\n\n==Life==\n\nSonallah Ibrahim was born in [[Cairo]]. His father was an upper-middle class civil servant; his mother, from a poor background, had been a nurse hired to look after his father's paralysed first wife. Ibrahim entered [[Cairo University]] to study law in 1952.<ref name=\"Hassan2003\">Abdalla F.

His main theme seems to be the importance of resisting the influence of the political mega-powers which attempt to invade the third world economically through many ways including the transcontinental companies. As an example, \"Sharaf\" [=Honour] deals with the intrusion of American politics in Egypt and includes long passages frankly criticising the big drug companies and their policies in third world countries. His interests are not limited to the situation in Egypt; \"Beirut..Beirut\" is something like an overview of the Lebanese civil war of the '70s and '80s, and \"Warda\" reveals a little-known episode about the activities of leftists and communists in Yemen and Oman in the '60s and '70s. The title of one of his latest novels is \"Amricanly\" which superficially means \" American\" or \"in an American way\" but is really a parody of another word \"Othmanly\" related to the notorious Dark Ages when Turkey ruled Egypt. The word \"Amricanly\" in another way is almost a transliteration of the phrase \"My affairs '''''were''''' mine\" in Arabic. His novel, \"The Committee\" is often described by critics as [[kafkaesque]]. In it the protagonist seeks entry into a shadowy organization. He is routinely subject to their vetting process and Sonallah uses his character to make numerous political observations in the form of speeches to the committee.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nSeveral of Ibrahim's works also explore how repetition and fastidious attention to detail can be used to examine the themes of childhood innocence, boredom, and sexual frustration. In ''Stealth'', the narrator recounts his childhood memories living with his father in a small, modest apartment. By describing each part of a mundane action, such as hanging up a coat or cooking some eggs, the narrator conveys his childhood curiosity and naivete about the adult world around him.

His novels, especially later ones, incorporate many excerpts from newspapers, magazines and other political sources as a way to enlighten the people about a certain political or social issue. Because of his political opinions he was imprisoned during the 1960s; his imprisonment is featured in his first book, ''That Smell'' (\u062a\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0627\u0626\u062d\u0629), which was one of the first writings in [[Egyptian literature]] to adopt a modernist tinge.\n\nIn harmony with his political ideas, in 2003 he refused to accept a prestigious literary award worth 100,000 [[Egyptian pound]]s from Egypt's [[Ministry of Culture (Egypt)|Ministry of Culture]].\n\n==Life==\n\nSonallah Ibrahim was born in [[Cairo]]. His father was an upper-middle class civil servant; his mother, from a poor background, had been a nurse hired to look after his father's paralysed first wife. Ibrahim entered [[Cairo University]] to study law in 1952.<ref name=\"Hassan2003\">Abdalla F. Hassan, [http://www.worldpress.org/Mideast/1205.cfm Black Humor in Dark Times], 19 June 2003.</ref> There he joined the Marxist [[Democratic Movement for National Liberation]] (DMNL). Despite the DMNL's support for [[Nasser]]'s coup, Nasser moved to repress Communists in the late 1950s.<ref name=\"Schatz2013\">Adam Schatz, Black, not Noir [review of Ibrahim, trans.

His main theme seems to be the importance of resisting the influence of the political mega-powers which attempt to invade the third world economically through many ways including the transcontinental companies. As an example, \"Sharaf\" [=Honour] deals with the intrusion of American politics in Egypt and includes long passages frankly criticising the big drug companies and their policies in third world countries. His interests are not limited to the situation in Egypt; \"Beirut..Beirut\" is something like an overview of the Lebanese civil war of the '70s and '80s, and \"Warda\" reveals a little-known episode about the activities of leftists and communists in Yemen and Oman in the '60s and '70s. The title of one of his latest novels is \"Amricanly\" which superficially means \" American\" or \"in an American way\" but is really a parody of another word \"Othmanly\" related to the notorious Dark Ages when Turkey ruled Egypt. The word \"Amricanly\" in another way is almost a transliteration of the phrase \"My affairs '''''were''''' mine\" in Arabic. His novel, \"The Committee\" is often described by critics as [[kafkaesque]]. In it the protagonist seeks entry into a shadowy organization. He is routinely subject to their vetting process and Sonallah uses his character to make numerous political observations in the form of speeches to the committee.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nSeveral of Ibrahim's works also explore how repetition and fastidious attention to detail can be used to examine the themes of childhood innocence, boredom, and sexual frustration. In ''Stealth'', the narrator recounts his childhood memories living with his father in a small, modest apartment. By describing each part of a mundane action, such as hanging up a coat or cooking some eggs, the narrator conveys his childhood curiosity and naivete about the adult world around him. In ''Ice'', extensive repetition of intimate acts, with the same atomistic attention to detail, indicates the narrator's boredom and frustration with life as a foreign student in Soviet Russia.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n==Works==\n\n*''The Smell of It'' (\u062a\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0627\u0626\u062d\u0629) (1966)\n**Translated by [[Denys Johnson Davies]], 1971; retranslated as ''That Smell & Notes from Prison'', [[Robyn Creswell]], 2013\n**This ''[[roman \u00e0 clef]]'' novella, set during the rule of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], is about a young Egyptian writer who had been a political prisoner is released, and he takes a look at the street life in his country.<ref name=\"Aboul-Elap2512\" />\n*''The Star of August'' (\u0646\u062c\u0645\u0629 \u0623\u063a\u0633\u0637\u0633) (1974)\n*''[[The Committee (novel)|The Committee]]'' (\u0627\u0644\u0644\u062c\u0646\u0629) (1981)\n** Translated by [[Charlene Constable]] and [[Mary St Germain]], 2001, published by [[Syracuse University Press]]<ref name=\"Aboul-Elap2512\" />\n*''Beirut..Beirut'' (\u0628\u064a\u0631\u0648\u062a \u0628\u064a\u0631\u0648\u062a) (1984)\n**Translated by Chip Rossetti, 2014, published by [[Bloomsbury Qatar Foundation Publishing]].\n* ''[[Zaat (novel)|Zaat]]'' (\u0630\u0627\u062a) (1992)\n**Translated by [[Anthony Calderbank]], 2001\n* ''Honor''  (\u0634\u0631\u0641) (1997)\n*''Cairo from Edge to Edge'' (1998)\n**A portrait of Cairo with photographer Jean Pierre Ribiere\n*''Rose''  (\u0648\u0631\u062f\u0629) (2000)\n* ''Amricanly''  (\u0623\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u0627\u0646\u0644\u0649) (2003)\n* ''Memoirs from the Oasis Prison'' (\u064a\u0648\u0645\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0627\u062d\u0627\u062a) (2005)\n* ''Stealth''  (\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0644\u0635\u0635) (2007)\n**Translated by [[Hosam Aboul-Ela]], 2010\n* ''The Turban and the Cap''  (\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0645\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0628\u0639\u0629) (2008)\n* ''Ice'' (\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0644\u064a\u062f) (2011)\n\n'''Work as a translator'''\n\n* \u0627\u0644\u0639\u062f\u0648 (The Enemy) by [[James William Drought]]\n\n==Awards==\n*The [[Ibn Rushd Prize for Freedom of Thought]] for the year 2004 in Berlin.\n\n==References==\n* Aboul-Ela, Hosam ([[University of Houston]]). \"Book Reviews.\" ''[[Edebiy\u00e2t]]'', 2003, Vol. 13, No. 2, pp.&nbsp;251\u2013268 (relevant pages: 251-253).

Only one source says March 15, 1885<ref name=\"heritage\"></ref> and his obituary states his age to be 69 in December 1954, which would then indicate the birth year as 1885. The draft card of 1942 reveals his birth place to be Dzia\u0142y\u0144, but it is unclear, which of the 4 places of this name in Poland it could have been. \n\nAccording to Fairfield's book, he built his first violin already at age 9 in 1895, which would indicate that he came from a luthier or a musical family. In 1903, by the age of 17, he was a trained violin maker.<ref name=\"Fairfield\"></ref> \n\nAs many Poles of the time would leave the poverty and the Russian and German nationalist oppression of partitioned Poland, he joined his family in the [[United States]]. The year [[1904]], when he would be 17-18 years old, is listed as the year of his immigration in the 1920 New York census, where his name is misspelled William Wikanoski and transcribed as Wikanski. <ref name=\"1920census\">1920 US New York Census, Brooklyn</ref>\n<br>As many Poles would do to assimilate in the United States, it seems he changed his Polish first name to a somewhat similar English name with the same initial, William, which would not be given as a child name in Poland, unless as the German form Wilhelm, known in the German speaking partitions of Poland. One source lists his Polish first name as Wladyslaw.<ref name=\"heritage\"></ref> In the New York census records, there are several people listed with the last name Wilkanowski. At least one male relative of Wilkanowski already resided in New York - the father of his cousin Maximilian, born in New York. In [[1905]], William and his wife Amelia had their daughter Helen; several children followed, listed as 7 children, all born in New York and speaking Polish, by the year 1920.<ref name=\"1920census\"></ref>\n\nWilliam worked in the shops of Ditson (Boston) and Fred [[Gretsch]] ([[New York City]]) until he opened his own workshop and store in Brooklyn, New York. He was also a violinist himself and was a member of a polka band in the 1920s.<ref name=\"Cozio Archive\"></ref>\n\n==Career in the United States==\nHe was listed as a violin maker in [[Brooklyn]] by 1933, and at least one violin made in Brooklyn dates to 1924. From 1937 to 1941, he worked in both an era and a location renowned for the [[jazz guitar]]. Gretsch offered Wilkanowski's violins in a 1940 flyer with the text \"his own personal work\u2026no other hand touches them.\" His violins were offered from $50\u2013150.\n\nWilkanowski is thought to have produced 5,000 violins and 100 [[viola]]s by 1942. <ref name=\"Fairfield\"></ref> Some of the higher quality violins were marked with an inlayed logo of the stylized letter ''W''; these instruments are thought to be entirely of his own making, while many of the others were made in the shops with assistants. The Gretsch Company released the Synchromatic line during the early '40s also, which were also [[archtop guitar]]s, but shared no other similarities with Wilkanowski guitars. His role in the Synchromatic is not known.\n\nAlthough known for his violins, Wilkanowski also produced a limited number of archtop guitars.  By 1942 he had sold 30 of these instruments, each unique in appointments and features, at $400 each, except for two deluxe Airway guitars, sold for $600. This price was in line with what was being charged for a D\u2019Angelico New Yorker, or a [[Gibson Guitar Corporation]] Super 400. There is no evidence of guitars made by Wilkanowski after 1943, instead he continued making and successfully selling violins until 1952.\n\n== Features of his guitars ==\nMost of the Wilkanowski guitars would look not like regular jazz guitars, but very much like oversized and slightly squished violins or small cellos with an added guitar neck. Some of his guitars did not have the cello shape, but rather a more conventional archtop shape, without the cello-like points above the waist. The Wilkanowski headstock is thought to have been the main influence in the headstock for the current [[Ovation Guitar]]. Many of his guitars have the unique flattened oval Wilkanowski headstock, although some featured a violin like scroll of aluminium, and some of his headstocks would just be like conventional guitar headstock. The backs of most of his guitars were one piece of flamed [[maple]], with no center joint. The wood William used would often be the Po Valley Poplar, a figured cello tonewood that can resemble maple. The finishing techniques included very light stain, or a violin color finish, and light sealer. The multiple layer binding was wooden, something fairly innovative at the time, and was raised above the level of the top and back plates. The f holes varied by instrument, standard shape, segmented, and later more modern cutouts appeared.  Some of the Instruments displayed the name AIRWAY, some had a W on the headstock, and some remained unbranded. Some of the guitars carry serial numbers, a signature, or a label. Several of the guitars are labeled Wilkanowski and Son, although nothing is known of the son's responsibility. One of these guitars, the Airway W-4 model with abalone shell inlayed rim around the entire body front and abalone ornaments on the neck, was given as a gift to Johnny Cash by his wife June in the 1980s. Johnny kept this guitar until his death, and the instrument was subsequently sold at the [[Johnny Cash]] estate auction by [[Sotheby's]] in 2004, to appear again on auction in 2009.<ref name=\"Cash\"></ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\nWilliam married a fellow Pole, Michalina Amelia Glowinska<ref name=\"heritage\"></ref> in New York and together they have raised 7 daughters: Genevieve (1907-1977), Carolyne, Helen, Florence, Irene, Viola and Natalie (1924-2009), and the 2 sons Henry (1922-1965) and Theodore Joseph (1919-1969). His wife would go by her middle name Amelia, sometimes registered as Emilia. In the 1940 New York census, she is listed as Emily and 53 years old, 1 year older than William listed as \"Wm\", 52 years old. Five of their youngest children - the 3 girls and 2 sons - are listed living with the parents in the same 1940 census, which indicates their 4 oldest daughters already moved out and married.<ref name=\"1940census\">1940 US Census, New York, Brooklyn</ref> The name Joseph seems to have been significant to Wilkanowski, who would also label some of his violins with the name \"Juzek\", which is the slightly misspelled Polish diminutive of Joseph. \n\nIn 1942, both of Wilkanowski's sons were drafted for the World War 2 Young Man Draft. In Henry's draft card, there is a detailed description of William as the head (of the house) of the draftee. This 1942 draft card provides the date and place of William's birth, misspelled as the non-existing place \"Dziatyn\" (as the Polish small letter [[\u0142]] looks very much like the Latin [[t]]), his age as 56, his height as 5'4, his weight as 155 pounds, his eye color as brown, hair as gray and complexion as ruddy.

When Amelia got sick, in 1950 he sold his shop property and moved his workshop to their Long Island home to be close to her and look after her. After she died of the illness in 1952, he became very depressed and despondent without her.<ref name=\"obituary\"></ref> He stopped making instruments altogether and lost his source of income, which negatively affected his finances, adding to his depressive state.<ref name=\"Cozio Archive\">William Wilkanowski biography article by Ira Kraemer in the Cozio Archive</ref> In early December 1954, he finally committed suicide<ref name=\"obituary\"></ref> and was laid to rest next to Amelia on December 13, 1954.<ref name=\"obituary\"></ref><ref name=\"grave\"></ref>\n\n==Early life==\nWilkanowski was born on November 15, 1886 as listed on his grave and in the draft card, and the year 1886 indicated as estimated in several census records of New York. Only one source says March 15, 1885<ref name=\"heritage\"></ref> and his obituary states his age to be 69 in December 1954, which would then indicate the birth year as 1885. The draft card of 1942 reveals his birth place to be Dzia\u0142y\u0144, but it is unclear, which of the 4 places of this name in Poland it could have been. \n<br>\nAccording to Fairfield's book, he built his first violin already at age 9 in 1895, which would indicate that he came from a luthier or a musical family. In 1903, by the age of 17, he was a trained violin maker.<ref name=\"Fairfield\"></ref> \n<br>\nAs many Poles of the time would leave the poverty and the Russian and German nationalist oppression of partitioned Poland, he joined his family in the [[United States]]. The year [[1904]], when he would be 17-18 years old, is listed as the year of his immigration in the 1920 New York census, where his name is misspelled William Wikanoski and transcribed as Wikanski. <ref name=\"1920census\">1920 New York Census, Brooklyn</ref>\n<br|As many Poles would do to assimilate in the United States, it seems he changed his Polish first name to a somewhat similar English name with the same initial letter, William, which would not be given as a child name in Poland, unless as the German form Wilhelm, known in the German speaking partitions of Poland. One source lists his Polish first name as Wladyslaw.<ref name=\"heritage\"></ref> In the New York census records, there are several people listed with the last name Wilkanowski. At least one male relative of Wilkanowski already resided in New York - the father of his cousin Maximilian, born in New York. In [[1905]], William and his wife Amelia had their daughter Helen; several children followed, listed as 7 children, all born in New York and speaking Polish, by the year 1920.<ref name=\"1920census\"></ref>\n<br> \nWilliam worked in the shops of Ditson (Boston) and Fred [[Gretsch]] ([[New York City]]) until he opened his own workshop and store in Brooklyn, New York. He was also a violinist himself and was a member of a polka band in the 1920s.<ref name=\"Cozio Archive\"></ref>\n\n==Career in the United States==\nHe was listed as a violin maker in [[Brooklyn]] by 1933, and at least one violin made in Brooklyn dates to 1924. From 1937 to 1941, he worked in both an era and a location renowned for the [[jazz guitar]]. Gretsch offered Wilkanowski's violins in a 1940 flyer with the text \"his own personal work\u2026no other hand touches them.\" His violins were offered from $50\u2013150.\n\nWilkanowski is thought to have produced 5,000 violins and 100 [[viola]]s by 1942. <ref name=\"Fairfield\"></ref> Some of the higher quality violins were marked with an inlayed logo of the stylized letter ''W''; these instruments are thought to be entirely of his own making, while many of the others were made in the shops with assistants. The Gretsch Company released the Synchromatic line during the early '40s also, which were also [[archtop guitar]]s, but shared no other similarities with Wilkanowski guitars. His role in the Synchromatic is not known.\n\nAlthough known for his violins, Wilkanowski also produced a limited number of archtop guitars.  By 1942 he had sold 30 of these instruments, each unique in appointments and features, at $400 each, except for two deluxe Airway guitars, sold for $600. This price was in line with what was being charged for a D\u2019Angelico New Yorker, or a [[Gibson Guitar Corporation]] Super 400. There is no evidence of guitars made by Wilkanowski after 1943, instead he continued making and successfully selling violins until 1952.\n\n== Features of his guitars ==\nMost of the Wilkanowski guitars would look not like regular jazz guitars, but very much like oversized and slightly squished violins or small cellos with an added guitar neck. Some of his guitars did not have the cello shape, but rather a more conventional archtop shape, without the cello-like points above the waist. The Wilkanowski headstock is thought to have been the main influence in the headstock for the current [[Ovation Guitar]]. Many of his guitars have the unique flattened oval Wilkanowski headstock, although some featured a violin like scroll of aluminium, and some of his headstocks would just be like conventional guitar headstock. The backs of most of his guitars were one piece of flamed [[maple]], with no center joint. The wood William used would often be the Po Valley Poplar, a figured cello tonewood that can resemble maple. The finishing techniques included very light stain, or a violin color finish, and light sealer. The multiple layer binding was wooden, something fairly innovative at the time, and was raised above the level of the top and back plates. The f holes varied by instrument, standard shape, segmented, and later more modern cutouts appeared.  Some of the Instruments displayed the name AIRWAY, some had a W on the headstock, and some remained unbranded. Some of the guitars carry serial numbers, a signature, or a label. Several of the guitars are labeled Wilkanowski and Son, although nothing is known of the son's responsibility. One of these guitars, the Airway W-4 model with abalone shell inlayed rim around the entire body front and abalone ornaments on the neck, was given as a gift to Johnny Cash by his wife June in the 1980s. Johnny kept this guitar until his death, and the instrument was subsequently sold at the [[Johnny Cash]] estate auction by [[Sotheby's]] in 2004, to appear again on auction in 2009.<ref name=\"Cash\"></ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\nWilliam married a fellow Pole, Michalina Amelia Glowinska<ref name=\"heritage\"></ref> in New York and together they have raised 7 daughters: Genevieve (1907-1977), Carolyne, Helen, Florence, Irene, Viola and Natalie (1924-2009), and the 2 sons Henry (1922-1965) and Theodore Joseph (1919-1969). His wife would go by her middle name Amelia, sometimes registered as Emilia. In the 1940 New York census, she is listed as Emily and 53 years old, 1 year older than William listed as \"Wm\", 52 years old. Five of their youngest children - the 3 girls and 2 sons - are listed living with the parents in the same 1940 census, which indicates their 4 oldest daughters already moved out and married.<ref name=\"1940census\">1940 US Census, New York, Brooklyn</ref> The name Joseph seems to have been significant to Wilkanowski, who would also label some of his violins with the name \"Juzek\", which is the slightly misspelled Polish diminutive of Joseph. \n\nIn 1942, both of Wilkanowski's sons were drafted for the World War 2 Young Man Draft. In Henry's draft card, there is a detailed description of William as the head (of the house) of the draftee. This 1942 draft card provides the date and place of William's birth, misspelled as the non-existing place \"Dziatyn\" (as the Polish small letter [[\u0142]] looks very much like the Latin [[t]]), his age as 56, his height as 5'4, his weight as 155 pounds, his eye color as brown, hair as gray and complexion as ruddy. In the occupation field, William was not disclosed as luthier, but as self employed.<ref name=\"draft1942\"></ref><br>\nHenry was sent to fight in Germany with his infantry battalion, which earned him a military grave at the Long Island National cemetery,<ref name=\"graveHenry\">[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/82604147/henry-wilkanowski] Grave of Henry Wilkanowski</ref> and Theodore became a corporal in WWII.<ref name=\"graveTheodore\">\n[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/29543508/theodore-j-wilkanowski] Grave of Theodore J.

In the late 1950s, at the beginning of the [[Space Race]], Cushman had been an editor at ''[[Aviation Week & Space Technology]].''<ref name=\"Electronics Who's Who\" />  From 1962 to the late-1980s, he was an editor for ''[[EDN (magazine)|Electronic Design News]].''  He started out at [[EDN (magazine)|EDN]] as the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] editor and soon rose to Special Features Editor covering [[microprocessor|microprocessing]].  Cushman was widely known within the microprocessing industry for his influential writings in ''[[EDN (magazine)|Electronic Design News]]'' about microprocessors during its infancy in the early 1970s, through its period of rapid growth and development in the 1980s.  His articles, collectively, chronicle the birth and early milestones of microprocessors and, at the time, helped bridge technical development with applications.  Citations of his work are prevalent in documents produced by academicians, engineers, the military, and [[NASA]].\n\nAt the time of Cushman's death, he and his wife were residents of [[Old Lyme, Connecticut]]. Before retiring, he and his wife had been a long-time residents of [[Port Washington, New York]].\n\n== Early career ==\nCushman earned a high school diploma in 1942 from the [[Professional Children's School]] in [[Manhattan, New York|Manhattan]].<ref name=\"Pro Children's School Alumni Records\" /> After the start of [[World War II]], he entered the [[U.S. Navy]] as a [[Lieutenant (junior grade)|Lt. J.G.]].  Upon earning a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]], he served in China. After the war, Cushman, an avid sailor, spent two years as a yacht designer with [[Philip Rhodes|Philip L. Rhodes]],<ref name=\"NYT Obit\" /> who later designed the [[Weatherly (yacht)|Weatherly]].  In 1959, after serving as Associate Editor of ''Automatic Control'', Cushman accepted a position as Public Relations Director of Daystrom, Inc., [[San Diego]],<ref name=\"ISA Journal\" /> which was acquired by [[Schlumberger]] in 1962, but continued to operate as a wholly owned subsidiary.<ref name=\"Electronic Industries\" />  Cushman had retired as Senior Editor at [[Cahners Publishing]],<ref name=\"Wilton\" /> a longtime division of [[Reed Elsevier]] and, at the time, parent of ''[[EDN (magazine)|EDN]].''\n\n== Growing up ==\nCushman had been a child actor.  At the age of {{Cardinal to word|{{age|1924|01|16|1939|01|21}}}} \u2014 from January 21, 1939, to June 1, 1939, and from July 17, 1939, to September 23, 1939 \u2014 Cushman had acted in the Broadway play, ''[[George S. Kaufman|The American Way]],'' in the role of Young Alex Hewitt at that [[RKO Roxy Theatre]].

Colony]].  The lineage is all paternal, hence the same surname.<ref name=\"Thomas & Mary Cushman lineage\" group=lower-alpha /> [[Mary Allerton]] was a [[List of Mayflower passengers|passenger]] on the [[Mayflower]], the first ship to arrive in [[Plymouth Colony|Plymouth]] in 1620.  [[Thomas Cushman (Plymouth colonist)|Thomas Cushman]] was a passenger on the [[Fortune (Plymouth Colony ship)|Fortune]], the second ship to arrive in 1621.  Cushman was also an eleventh generation [[lineal descendant]] of [[Francis Eaton (Mayflower passenger)|Francis Eaton]], also a [[List of Mayflower passengers|passenger]] on the [[Mayflower]] and settler of [[Plymouth Colony|Plymouth]]<ref name=\"Francis Eaton\" group=lower-alpha /> \u2014 a fourth generation female descendant of [[Francis Eaton (Mayflower passenger)|Francis Eaton]] married a third generation descendant of [[Robert Cushman|Robert]] and [[Mary Allerton|Mary Cushman]].\n\nNowadays, tens of millions of Americans have at least one ancestor from the [[Plymouth Colony]], many of whom affiliated with the [[Mayflower Society]].  But, according to [[Galton\u2013Watson process|Galton-Watson]] probability, only a fraction of that number have an unbroken chain of [[Patrilineality|paternal]] lineage maintaining the same surname.\n\n; Family\nCushman married Rose Katherine Clausing October 4, 1952, in [[Butler County, Ohio]].

In the late 1950s, at the beginning of the [[Space Race]], Cushman had been an editor at ''[[Aviation Week & Space Technology]].''<ref name=\"Electronics Who's Who\" />  From 1962 to the late-1980s, he was an editor for ''[[EDN (magazine)|Electronic Design News]].''  He started out at [[EDN (magazine)|EDN]] as the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] editor and soon rose to Special Features Editor covering [[microprocessor|microprocessing]].  Cushman was widely known within the microprocessing industry for his influential writings in ''[[EDN (magazine)|Electronic Design News]]'' about microprocessors during its infancy in the early 1970s, through its period of rapid growth and development in the 1980s.  His articles, collectively, chronicle the birth and early milestones of microprocessors and, at the time, helped bridge technical development with applications.  Citations of his work are prevalent in documents produced by academicians, engineers, the military, and [[NASA]].\n\nAt the time of Cushman's death, he and his wife were residents of [[Old Lyme, Connecticut]]. Before retiring, he and his wife had been a long-time residents of [[Port Washington, New York]].\n\n== Early career ==\nCushman earned a high school diploma in 1942 from the [[Professional Children's School]] in [[Manhattan, New York|Manhattan]].<ref name=\"Pro Children's School Alumni Records\" /> After the start of [[World War II]], he entered the [[U.S. Navy]] as a [[Lieutenant (junior grade)|Lt. J.G.]].  Upon earning a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]], he served in China. After the war, Cushman, an avid sailor, spent two years as a yacht designer with [[Philip Rhodes|Philip L. Rhodes]],<ref name=\"NYT Obit\" /> who later designed the [[Weatherly (yacht)|Weatherly]].  In 1959, after serving as Associate Editor of ''Automatic Control'', Cushman accepted a position as Public Relations Director of Daystrom, Inc., [[San Diego]],<ref name=\"ISA Journal\" /> which was acquired by [[Schlumberger]] in 1962, but continued to operate as a wholly owned subsidiary.<ref name=\"Electronic Industries\" />  Cushman had retired as Senior Editor at [[Cahners Publishing]],<ref name=\"Wilton\" /> a longtime division of [[Reed Elsevier]] and, at the time, parent of ''[[EDN (magazine)|EDN]].''\n\n== Growing up ==\nCushman had been a child actor.  At the age of {{Cardinal to word|{{age|1924|01|16|1939|01|21}}}} \u2014 from January 21, 1939, to June 1, 1939, and from July 17, 1939, to September 23, 1939 \u2014 Cushman had acted in the Broadway play, ''[[George S.

It was positively received by critics and grossed over $19 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nA highly contagious outbreak ravages the planet. Paul, his wife Sarah, and their teenage son Travis are secluded in their [[Retreat (survivalism)|home deep in the woods]] in an undisclosed location. After Sarah's father, Bud, contracts the disease, they kill him, and burn his body in a shallow grave. The next night, they capture an intruder breaking into the house. Paul ties him to a tree, and places a bag over his head overnight to confirm he is not suffering from the disease. The stranger, Will, explains he did not know the house was occupied, and was searching for fresh water for his wife and his young son. Will offers to trade some of their food for water. Sarah suggests bringing the strangers to their home, reasoning the more people, the easier it would be to defend themselves.  Paul reluctantly agrees, and drives Will to collect his family. Along the way, they are ambushed by two men. Paul kills them, while accusing Will of setting him up. Will explains he fought them, and assuages Paul's mistrust.\n\nPaul returns with Will, his wife Kim, and son Andrew. After establishing the rules Paul and Sarah use to stay safe, including a) keeping the only entrance locked with a key Paul or Sarah wear around their neck, and b)  keeping nighttime excursions to a minimum, the two families establish a sense of normality, and grow closer. One day, Travis's dog Stanley is barking aggressively at and chases an unseen presence in the woods. Travis follows the dog into the woods before Stanley's barking suddenly ceases. Travis insists to Paul and Will he heard something in the woods. They return home after Paul assures Travis that Stanley knows the woods and will find his way home. That night, Will seemingly contradicts a story he told Paul earlier about his and Kim's activities prior to finding the abandoned house. Paul's response suggests an increasing distrust of Will. \n\nThat evening, Travis discovers Andrew sleeping on the floor of Bud's old room suffering from a nightmare. Travis leads him back to his parents' room before hearing a sound from downstairs. Travis finds the front door of the house is slightly-open, and he hears noises. He wakes Paul and Will. They investigate, finding a bleeding and gravely-sick Stanley on the floor. They kill and burn the dog. After Travis reveals the door was open before he came downstairs, Sarah suggests sleepwalking Andrew opened the door. Kim argues the possibility as tensions rise. Paul suspects Andrew is infected, and decides they should quarantine in their separate rooms for a couple days so they can calm down and ensure no one is sick. That evening, Travis is awakened by a nightmare about his grandfather.\n\nThe next morning, Travis overhears Andrew coughing constantly. A distraught Kim tells Will they need to leave. Travis informs his parents Andrew might be infected, and, as such, he too may be infected. Paul and Sarah don protective masks and gloves, and take weapons to confront Kim and Will. After Paul asks to be let in to see if Andrew is sick, Will draws a gun and takes Paul captive. Will insists his family is healthy, repeatedly tells Andrew to keep his eyes shut and orders Paul to remove the mask. Will demands Paul give him \"...a fair share...\" of food and water so they can leave. Paul and Sarah overwhelm Will, and force him and his family outside.  Will attacks Paul, and tries to beat him to death as Sarah shoots Will in the back. He dies from his wound. Kim flees into the woods with Andrew. Paul fires at them, killing Andrew. Kim hysterically begs Paul to kill her to end her misery, and he does by shooting her.\n\nLater, Travis awakens in bed, visibly sick. His mother comforts him as he dies. Paul and Sarah, now visibly infected, sit at the dinner table in silence.

It was positively received by critics and grossed over $19 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nA highly contagious outbreak ravages the planet. Paul, his wife Sarah, and their teenage son Travis are secluded in their [[Retreat (survivalism)|home deep in the woods]] in an undisclosed location. After Sarah's father, Bud, contracts the disease, they kill him, and burn his body in a shallow grave. The next night, they capture an intruder breaking into the house. Paul ties him to a tree, and places a bag over his head overnight to confirm he is not suffering from the disease. The stranger, Will, explains he did not know the house was occupied, and was searching for fresh water for his wife and his young son. Will offers to trade some of their food for water. Sarah suggests bringing the strangers to their home, reasoning the more people, the easier it would be to defend themselves.  Paul reluctantly agrees, and drives Will to collect his family. Along the way, they are ambushed by two men. Paul kills them, while accusing Will of setting him up. Will explains he fought them, and assuages Paul's mistrust.\n\nPaul returns with Will, his wife Kim, and son Andrew. After establishing the rules Paul and Sarah use to stay safe, including a) keeping the only entrance locked with a key Paul or Sarah wear around their neck, and b)  keeping nighttime excursions to a minimum, the two families establish a sense of normality, and grow closer. One day, Travis's dog Stanley is barking aggressively at and chases an unseen presence in the woods. Travis follows the dog into the woods before Stanley's barking suddenly ceases. Travis insists to Paul and Will he heard something in the woods. They return home after Paul assures Travis that Stanley knows the woods and will find his way home. That night, Will seemingly contradicts a story he told Paul earlier about his and Kim's activities prior to finding the abandoned house. Paul's response suggests an increasing distrust of Will. \n\nThat evening, Travis discovers Andrew sleeping on the floor of Bud's old room suffering from a nightmare. Travis leads him back to his parents' room before hearing a sound from downstairs. Travis finds the front door of the house is slightly-open, and he hears noises. He wakes Paul and Will. They investigate, finding a bleeding and gravely-sick Stanley on the floor. They kill and burn the dog. After Travis reveals the door was open before he came downstairs, Sarah suggests sleepwalking Andrew opened the door. Kim argues the possibility as tensions rise. Paul suspects Andrew is infected, and decides they should quarantine in their separate rooms for a couple days so they can calm down and ensure no one is sick. That evening, Travis is awakened by a nightmare about his grandfather.\n\nThe next morning, Travis overhears Andrew coughing constantly. A distraught Kim tells Will they need to leave. Travis informs his parents Andrew might be infected, and, as such, he too may be infected. Paul and Sarah don protective masks and gloves, and take weapons to confront Kim and Will. After Paul asks to be let in to see if Andrew is sick, Will draws a gun and takes Paul captive. Will insists his family is healthy, repeatedly tells Andrew to keep his eyes shut and orders Paul to remove the mask. Will demands Paul give him \"...a fair share...\" of food and water so they can leave. Paul and Sarah overwhelm Will, and force him and his family outside.  Will attacks Paul, and tries to beat him to death as Sarah shoots Will in the back. He dies from his wound. Kim flees into the woods with Andrew. Paul fires at them, killing Andrew. Kim hysterically begs Paul to kill her to end her misery, and he does by shooting her.\n\nLater, Travis awakens in bed, visibly sick. His mother comforts him as he dies. Paul and Sarah, now visibly infected, sit at the dinner table in silence. They share a shattered, devastated look.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--In order as final credits-->\n* [[Joel Edgerton]] as Paul, Sarah\u2019s husband and Travis\u2019s father\n* [[Christopher Abbott]] as Will, Kim\u2019s husband and Andrew\u2019s father\n* [[Carmen Ejogo]] as Sarah, Paul\u2019s wife and Travis\u2019s mother\n* [[Riley Keough]] as Kim, Will\u2019s wife and Andrew\u2019s mother\n* [[Kelvin Harrison Jr.]] as Travis, Paul and Sarah\u2019s son\n* Griffin Robert Faulkner as Andrew, Will and Kim\u2019s son\n* David Pendleton as Bud, Sarah's father and Travis\u2019s grandfather\n* Mickey as Stanley, the family dog\n* Chase Joliet and Mick O'Rourke as men who attack Paul and Will\n\n==Production==\nShults began writing the film after the death of his father as a way of dealing with the pain.<ref name=\"Slashfilm\"/> He cites [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]]\u2019s 1562 oil painting ''[[The Triumph of Death]]'' as inspiration and it features prominently in the movie and its first trailer.<ref name=\"slate\">{{cite web|last=Stevens|first=Dana|title=slate.com|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/movies/2017/06/it_comes_at_night_the_new_horror_movie_reviewed.html|website=It Comes at Night|accessdate=24 December 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"telegraph\">{{cite web|last1=Collin|first1=Robbie|title=It Comes At Night review: the end of the world has never been more gripping|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/comes-night-review-end-world-has-never-gripping/|website=telegraph.co.uk|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited|accessdate=24 December 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"ew.com\">{{cite web|last1=McGovern|first1=Joe|title=ew.com|url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/06/09/it-comes-at-night-director-influences/|website=It Comes at Night director shares 10 influences, from Kubrick to video games|publisher=Time Inc|accessdate=24 December 2017}}</ref> Although the film is [[post-apocalyptic]] Shults did not look to any other such films as inspiration; instead, he cited the work of [[Paul Thomas Anderson]] and [[John Cassavetes]] and the films ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' and ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' as inspirations.
