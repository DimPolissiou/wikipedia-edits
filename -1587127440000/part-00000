The book introduced the now-universal practice of listing ingredients and giving suggested cooking times for each recipe. It included the first recipes in English for [[Brussels sprout]]s and for [[spaghetti]]. It also contains the first recipe for what Acton called \"[[Christmas pudding]]\"; the dish was normally called plum pudding, recipes for which had appeared previously, although Acton was the first to put the name and recipe together.\n\nActon was born in 1799 in [[Sussex]]. She was raised in [[Suffolk]] where she ran a girls' [[boarding school]] before spending time in France. On her return to England in 1826 she published a collection of poetry and released her cookery book in 1845, aimed at [[middle class]] families. Written in an engaging prose, the book was well received by reviewers. It was reprinted within the year and several editions followed until 1918, when [[Longman]], the book's publisher, took the decision not to reprint. In 1857 Acton published ''[[The English Bread-Book for Domestic Use]]'', a more academic and studious work than ''Modern Cookery''. The work consisted of a history of bread-making in England, a study of European methods of baking and numerous recipes.\n\nIn the later years of its publication, ''Modern Cookery'' was eclipsed by the success of [[Isabella Beeton]]'s bestselling ''[[Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management]]'' (1861), which included several recipes [[plagiarised]] from Acton's work. Although ''Modern Cookery'' was not reprinted in full until 1994, the book has been admired by English cooks in the second part of the 20th century, and influenced many of them, including [[Elizabeth David]], [[Jane Grigson]], [[Delia Smith]] and [[Rick Stein]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n[[File:Eliza Acton - advertisement for girls school.jpg|thumb|Advertisement placed by Acton in ''The Ipswich Journal'' for her [[boarding school]]]]\nEliza Acton was born on 17 April 1799 in [[Battle, East Sussex|Battle]], [[Sussex]], and was [[baptised]] at her local [[parish church]] on 5 June. She was the eldest of six sisters and three brothers born to John Acton, a [[brewer]], and his wife Elizabeth, ''{{nee}}'' Mercer.{{sfn|Ray|2008}}{{sfn|Hardy|2011|p=17}}{{efn|Although Acton had eight siblings, one died when only a few weeks old, probably of [[Baby colic|colic]].{{sfn|Hardy|2011|p=31}}}} By 1800 the family had moved to [[Ipswich]], [[Suffolk]], where they lived in a house adjoining the St. Peter's Brewery, where John took employment running Trotman, Halliday & Studd, the company that owned the brewery.{{sfn|Hardy|2011|pp=19 and 21}}{{efn|Trotman, Halliday and Studd the three eponymous owners of the company were involved in other lines of business, and the brewery was an investment for their spare capital, which accounts for John's employment to run the business.{{sfn|Hardy|2011|p=26}}}} In 1811 Trotman died, and John was offered the opportunity to become the junior partner in the firm; he accepted and the business was renamed Studd, Halliday and Acton. Sheila Hardy, in her biography of Eliza, considers it likely that John would have borrowed heavily to buy himself into the business.{{sfn|Hardy|2011|pp=32\u201334}}\n\nIn 1817 Acton, with a Miss Nicolson\u2014about whom no further information is known\u2014opened a \"[[boarding school]] for young ladies\" in [[Claydon, Suffolk|Claydon]], just outside Ipswich.{{sfn|Ray|2008}}{{sfn|Hardy|2011|pp=40\u201341}} In 1819 Acton left the school and opened another in September with her sisters, this time at nearby [[Great Bealings]]; the school moved {{convert|3|mi|km|spell=in}} to [[Woodbridge, Suffolk|Woodbridge]] in 1822 and had probably closed by 1825.{{sfn|Hardy|2011|p=45}}\n\nEarly in her life Acton spent some time in France\u2014either in Paris or the south of the country\u2014but it is not known when she left England; Hardy considers it likely that she travelled in 1823.{{sfn|Hardy|2011|p=16}} The food historian Elizabeth Ray, writing in the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', states that Acton travelled abroad for the good of her health, because she had a weak constitution.{{sfn|Ray|2008}} It is possible that she was pregnant when she left for Paris and that she went abroad to give birth to an [[illegitimate]] daughter.{{sfn|Quayle|1978|p=165}}{{sfn|Freeman|1989|p=159}}{{efn|Because of the stigma surrounding [[unintended pregnancies]] out of wedlock, it was common for middle-class women to move away from home to a relative's house, or abroad, to have the child, which was then adopted by a married relative.{{sfn|Hardy|2011|pp=72\u201373}}}} The food writers Mary Aylett and Olive Ordish theorise that Acton's child was raised by Sarah, Eliza's sister. The two observe that \"there is no evidence for this, other than family tradition\".{{sfn|Aylett|Ordish|1965|pp=180\u2013181}} Hardy dismisses the theory, stating that Acton did not have a sister called Sarah, let alone one who was married (none of Acton's sisters were married); she also observes that she has found no baptismal or census record that would account for a child of the right age.{{sfn|Hardy|2011|p=72}} While in France Acton had an unhappy relationship with a French army officer;{{sfn|Ray|2008}} it is possible there was an engagement, but if so it was broken off. She returned to England, probably in 1826.{{sfn|Aylett|Ordish|1965|p=181}}{{sfn|Hardy|2011|p=63}}\n\n===Poet===\n[[File:The Red House, Bordyke - geograph.org.uk - 2342303.jpg|thumb|Bordyke House (now Red House), near Tonbridge]]\nActon had been writing poetry since at least 1822, as she wrote that year on the bottom of one of her poems.{{efn|Only five of her existing poems are dated, the first in 1822, the last in May 1826. There is no record of when the others were written.{{sfn|Hardy|2011|p=54}}}} She wrote at least one while in France, \"On Approaching Paris\", which she dated 1826.{{sfn|Hardy|2011|pp=54\u201356}} When she returned to England, she arranged for a collection to be published by [[Longman]].{{sfn|Ray|2008}} As was the practice for publishers at the time, Acton had to provide the names of subscribers\u2014those who had pre-paid for a copy\u2014who were listed inside the work; nearly all came from Suffolk. 328 copies were printed in October 1826 and a reprint was needed within a month.{{sfn|Hardy|2011|pp=58\u201359}} She subsequently wrote some longer poems, including \"The Chronicles of Castel Framlingham\", which was printed in the ''Sudbury Chronicle'' in 1838, and \"The Voice of the North\", which was written in 1842 on the occasion of [[Queen Victoria]]'s first visit to Scotland.{{sfn|Ray|2008}} Other poems were published in a local periodical, the ''Sudbury Pocket Book''.{{sfn|Aylett|Ordish|1965|p=181}}\n\nIn 1827 John Acton was declared [[bankrupt]], and the company in which he was a partner was dissolved; one of his business partners was involved in the claim against him. The [[Commissioner of Bankruptcy]] ordered John to surrender himself to the Office of the Commissioners to disclose his wealth, but he fled to France.{{efn|The practice of bankrupts evading their creditors by going into exile in France was not uncommon; Nelson's mistress, [[Emma, Lady Hamilton]], had done so in 1814.{{sfn|Hardy|2011|p=78}}}} In his absence his family moved into Bordyke House, near [[Tonbridge]], [[Kent]], where Elizabeth Acton, Eliza's mother, turned the large building into a boarding house for [[upper class]] guests, particularly for those who wanted to visit [[Royal Tunbridge Wells]] and enjoy the [[spa]] facilities there.{{sfn|Hardy|2011|pp=77\u201382}} It is likely that Elizabeth left Bordyke House around 1841, although her daughter remained in residence.{{sfn|Hardy|2011|pp=86 and 89}}\n\n===Cookery writer===\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align    = right\n| direction = vertical\n| header = Illustrations from the 1845 edition of ''[[Modern Cookery for Private Families]]''\n| width    =\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = Beef cuts - Acton, Modern Cookery, page 169.jpg\n| width1    = 170\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = Information on ingredients, including cuts of beef\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    = Copper Fish or Ham Kettle Eliza Acton.jpg\n| width2    = 170\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = Details of cooking equipment, including a copper kettle for ham or fish\n<!-- Image 3 -->\n| image3    = Eliza Acton Orange Jellies 1845.jpg\n| width3    = 170\n| alt3      =\n| caption3  = Examples of presentation, including Oranges filled with Jelly\n}}\n{{further|Modern Cookery for Private Families}}\n\nAt some point\u2014Hardy considers 1835; Aylett and Ordish consider 1837\u2014Acton sent a further set of poems to Longman for publishing.

A chapter covers [[curries]] (and [[potted meat]]s), and gives recipes for Eastern \"[[chutney|chatneys]]\" (chutney), treating them as a naturalised Anglo-Indian dish, rather than of solely Indian origin, according to the professor of English literature Susan Zlotnick.{{sfn|Zlotnick|1996|pp=59\u201360}} The book contains the first recipe for [[brussels sprout]]s,{{sfn|Snodgrass|2004}} and the first use in an English cookery book of the word ''spaghetti''\u2014which she spelled ''sparghetti''.{{sfn|Walker|2013|p=57}}{{sfn|\"Spaghetti\".

With the inclusion of timings and ingredients, ''Modern Cookery'' differed from other cookery books, and was a development of Acton's own.{{sfn|Ray|2008}} Acton wrote that each recipe had been cooked and \"proved beneath our own roof and under our own personal inspection\".{{sfn|Acton|1845|p=x}} The food historian Sarah Freeman describes the cooking instructions Acton produced as being written \"so conscientiously, and with such gastronomic sensitivity, that&nbsp;...

Hardy also sees in the poems an \"almost masculine intensity and depth of feeling\".{{sfn|Hardy|2011|pp=61\u201364}} O'Brien sees humour in some of Acton's poetry, and cites \"Come To My Grave\"\u2014a work about \"a mildly acerbic and witty potential revenant, musing on revenge\"\u2014as a parody of a love lyric with [[Gothic fiction|Gothic romantic]] overtones.{{sfn|O'Brien|2012|pp=47\u201348}}\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nCome to my grave when I am gone,\nAnd bend a moment there alone;\nIt will not cost thee much of pain\nTo trample on my heart again\u2013\nOr, if it would, for ever stay\nFar distant from my mouldering clay:\nI would not wound thy breast to prove\nE'en its most deep, 'remorse of love.'\nThe grave should be a shrine of peace\nWhere all unkindly feelings cease;\u2013\nThough thou wilt calmly gaze on mine\nI would not live the hour to see,\nWhich doom'd my glance to rest on thine:\u2013\nThat moment's bitter agony\nWould bid the very life-blood start\nBack, and congeal around my heart!\u2013{{sfn|Acton|1826|pp=89\u201390}}\n</poem></blockquote>\n\n===Cookery===\n[[File:English Bread frontispiece 2.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece of ''The English Bread Book'', 1857]]\nO'Brien sees that, through the high quality of Acton's prose, ''Modern Cookery'' is a unique cultural document.{{sfn|O'Brien|2012|p=45}} As the food writer [[Elizabeth David]] writes,\n\n<blockquote>[Acton's]&nbsp;... book was the final expression&nbsp;... of pre-Industrial England's taste in food and attitude to cookery. The dishes she describes and the ingredients which went into them would have been familiar to [[Jane Austen]] and [[Lord Byron]], to [[Fanny Burnley]] and [[Tobias Smollett]].{{sfn|David|1974|p=xxix}}</blockquote>\n\nMany of the dishes Acton describes belong, according to David, to the 18th century and, with increasing industrialisation and urbanisation of the 19th century, the staple foods described were already being replaced. David cites the example of [[Bird's Custard Powder]], launched in 1840, as an example of the radical changes being introduced to cooking.{{sfn|David|1974|p=xxix}} Acton adopted some of the changes in food science into the 1855 re-write of the book, including the developments of [[Justus von Liebig]]\u2014the developer of the [[Oxo (food)|Oxo]] brand beef [[stock cube]]\u2014and [[William Gregory (chemist)|William Gregory]], Liebig's pupil and translator.{{sfn|Lieffers|2012|p=946}}\n\nActon, in her preface to ''Modern Cookery'', writes that her \"first and best attention has been bestowed on&nbsp;... what are usually termed plain English dishes\" for her recipes,{{sfn|Acton|1845|p=31}} and Christopher Driver, the journalist and food critic, considers the book \"as English as&nbsp;... [its] eighteenth-century predecessors\".{{sfn|Driver|1983|p=6}} Elizabeth Ray observes that while Acton \"is basically a very English cook\", many of the recipes are labelled as French dishes, and foreign food is given its own chapter.{{sfn|Ray|1974|p=xix}} These are recipes from the cuisines of Indian, Syria, Turkey, Italy, Germany, Portugal, Mauritius, Switzerland and the West Indies.{{sfn|Freeman|1989|p=162}}{{sfn|Acton|1855|pp=605\u2013622}} Acton was willing to learn from foreign food cultures, and wrote \"Without adopting blindly foreign modes in anything merely because they ''are'' foreign, surely we should be wise to learn from other nations\".{{sfn|Acton|1855|p=xi}} Similarly, ''The English Bread Book'' was focused on British bread and, in her preface, Acton wrote \"Bread is a first necessity of life to the great mass of the English people; being in part the food of all\u2014the chief food of many\u2014and almost the sole food of many more.\"{{sfn|Acton|1857|p=v}} She devotes a whole chapter to the approach to bread and bread-making in France, Germany and Belgium, and the book contains recipes for German [[pumpernickel]], French [[baguette]]s, Italian [[polenta]] bread, Turkish rolls and Indian breads.{{sfn|Acton|1857|pp=29, 141, 161, 166, 168 and 177}}\n\nThe food historian Bob Ashley identifies that the strongest theme in ''Modern Cookery'' is economy in food, although this is also tempered by Acton's advice to reject dubious ingredients.{{sfn|Ashley|2004|p=158}}{{sfn|David|1974|p=xxviii}} In her preface to the book, Acton writes that \"It may be safely averred that good cookery is the best and truest economy, turning to full account every wholesome article of food, and converting into palatable meals what the ignorant either render uneatable or throw away in disdain\".{{sfn|Acton1855|p=viii}} She provides a recipe for \"Elegant Economist's Pudding\", which uses left-over Christmas pudding;{{sfn|Acton|1845|p=380}} when giving a recipe for \"Superlative Hare Soup\", she also provides one for \"A Less Expensive Hare Soup\".{{sfn|Acton|1845|pp=31\u201332}}{{efn|The superlative soup includes a hare, ham, [[Mace (spice)|mace]] and half a [[imperial pint|pint]] (280 ml) of [[Port wine|port]]; ingredients for the less expensive version include beef, hare and a bunch of savoury herbs.{{sfn|Acton|1845|pp=31\u201332}}}} The social historian [[John Burnett (historian)|John Burnet]] observes that although the dishes were supposedly aimed at middle-class families of modest income, the book contains recipes that include truffles in champagne, soles in cream and a pie of venison and hare.{{sfn|Burnett|1964}}{{efn|The recipes are, respectively: \"Truffles with Champagne, A La Serviette\" which, Acton writes, is so expensive as to only be served by the wealthy;{{sfn|Acton|1845|p=322}} \"Soles Stewed in Cream\"\u2014the recipe uses half to a pint (280\u2013570 ml) of \"as much sweet rich cream as will cover&nbsp;...

Examining a 100-word paragraph in ''Modern Cookery'' for instructions on beating egg whites for a sponge cake, David considers it superior to an eight-page piece on the same topic in the 1927 work ''[[La bonne cuisine de Madame E. Saint-Ange]]''.{{sfn|David|1974|p=xxviii}}\n\nThere is humour in Acton's work, particularly when reporting on a recipe going wrong.{{sfn|O'Brien|2012|pp=45\u201346}}{{sfn|Colquhoun|2008|p=281}}{{sfn|Hughes|2006|p=212}} Her recipe for Publisher's Pudding, which contains [[cognac]], [[macaroon]]s, cream and almonds, \"can scarcely be made ''too rich''\",{{sfn|Acton|1845|p=374}} while the Poor Author's Pudding is made with milk, bread, eggs and sugar, and is a more simple dish.{{sfn|Acton|1845|pp=407\u2013408}} Similarly, in her recipe for Superior Pine-Apple Marmalade, she writes that if the mixture is placed onto a direct heat it \"will often convert what would otherwise be excellent preserve, into a strange sort of compound, for which it is difficult to find a name\".{{sfn|Acton|1855|pp=513\u2013514}}\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Game cuts - Acton, Modern Cookery, page 271.jpg|thumb|Cuts of [[Game (hunting)|game]], from ''Modern Cookery'']]\n''Modern Cookery'' remained in print until 1918, when its popularity waned in the face of competition from other books and Longmans took the decision not to republish.{{sfn|David|1974|p=xxx}} Acton's works remained out of print until 1968 when a selection of her recipes was collected into ''The Best of Eliza Acton'', edited by Elizabeth Ray and including an introduction by Elizabeth David.

all taken from Acton.{{sfn|Hughes|2006|p=213}} In her works, Isabella Beeton partly followed the new layout of Acton's recipes, although with a major alteration: whereas ''Modern Cookery'' provides the method of cooking followed by a list of the required ingredients, the recipes in ''The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine'' and ''Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management'' list the timings and components before the cooking process.{{sfn|Freeman|1977|p=76}}\n\nThe food historian [[Bee Wilson]] considers many modern cookery writers to be indebted to Acton and her work.{{sfn|Wilson|2011}} Elizabeth David wrote in 1977 that ''The English Bread Book'' was a major influence on and source for her own ''English Bread and Yeast Cookery'', and that she owes Acton a debt for it;{{sfn|David|2001|p=xiii}} David also describes ''Modern Cookery'' as \"the greatest cookery book in our language\".{{sfn|David|1974|p=xxx}} The cook [[Delia Smith]] is of a similar opinion, and describes Acton as \"the best cookery writer in the English language\".{{sfn|Smith|2011|p=7}} The cookery writer [[Jane Grigson]] was influenced by Acton, particularly when she wrote ''English Food'' (1974),{{sfn|Cooke|2015}} while the chef [[Rick Stein]] included her \"Soles Stewed in Cream\" in his cookery book ''Seafood Lovers' Guide'' (2000).{{sfn|Stein|2003}}\n\n==Notes and

The book introduced the now-universal practice of listing ingredients and giving suggested cooking times for each recipe. It included the first recipes in English for [[Brussels sprout]]s and for [[spaghetti]]. It also contains the first recipe for what Acton called \"[[Christmas pudding]]\"; the dish was normally called plum pudding, recipes for which had appeared previously, although Acton was the first to put the name and recipe together.\n\nActon was born in 1799 in [[Sussex]]. She was raised in [[Suffolk]] where she ran a girls' [[boarding school]] before spending time in France. On her return to England in 1826 she published a collection of poetry and released her cookery book in 1845, aimed at [[middle class]] families. Written in an engaging prose, the book was well received by reviewers. It was reprinted within the year and several editions followed until 1918, when [[Longman]], the book's publisher, took the decision not to reprint. In 1857 Acton published ''[[The English Bread-Book for Domestic Use]]'', a more academic and studious work than ''Modern Cookery''. The work consisted of a history of bread-making in England, a study of European methods of baking and numerous recipes.\n\nIn the later years of its publication, ''Modern Cookery'' was eclipsed by the success of [[Isabella Beeton]]'s bestselling ''[[Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management]]'' (1861), which included several recipes [[plagiarised]] from Acton's work. Although ''Modern Cookery'' was not reprinted in full until 1994, the book has been admired by English cooks in the second part of the 20th century, and influenced many of them, including [[Elizabeth David]], [[Jane Grigson]], [[Delia Smith]] and [[Rick Stein]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n[[File:Eliza Acton - advertisement for girls school.jpg|thumb|Advertisement placed by Acton in ''The Ipswich Journal'' for her [[boarding school]]]]\nEliza Acton was born on 17 April 1799 in [[Battle, East Sussex|Battle]], [[Sussex]], and was [[baptised]] at her local [[parish church]] on 5 June. She was the eldest of six sisters and three brothers born to John Acton, a [[brewer]], and his wife Elizabeth, ''{{nee}}'' Mercer.{{sfn|Ray|2008}}{{sfn|Hardy|2011|p=17}}{{efn|Although Acton had eight siblings, one died when only a few weeks old, probably of [[Baby colic|colic]].{{sfn|Hardy|2011|p=31}}}} By 1800 the family had moved to [[Ipswich]], [[Suffolk]], where they lived in a house adjoining the St. Peter's Brewery, where John took employment running Trotman, Halliday & Studd, the company that owned the brewery.{{sfn|Hardy|2011|pp=19 and 21}}{{efn|Trotman, Halliday and Studd the three eponymous owners of the company were involved in other lines of business, and the brewery was an investment for their spare capital, which accounts for John's employment to run the business.{{sfn|Hardy|2011|p=26}}}} In 1811 Trotman died, and John was offered the opportunity to become the junior partner in the firm; he accepted and the business was renamed Studd, Halliday and Acton. Sheila Hardy, in her biography of Eliza, considers it likely that John would have borrowed heavily to buy himself into the business.{{sfn|Hardy|2011|pp=32\u201334}}\n\nIn 1817 Acton, with a Miss Nicolson\u2014about whom no further information is known\u2014opened a \"[[boarding school]] for young ladies\" in [[Claydon, Suffolk|Claydon]], just outside Ipswich.{{sfn|Ray|2008}}{{sfn|Hardy|2011|pp=40\u201341}} In 1819 Acton left the school and opened another in September with her sisters, this time at nearby [[Great Bealings]]; the school moved {{convert|3|mi|km|spell=in}} to [[Woodbridge, Suffolk|Woodbridge]] in 1822 and had probably closed by 1825.{{sfn|Hardy|2011|p=45}}\n\nEarly in her life Acton spent some time in France\u2014either in Paris or the south of the country\u2014but it is not known when she left England; Hardy considers it likely that she travelled in 1823.{{sfn|Hardy|2011|p=16}} The food historian Elizabeth Ray, writing in the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', states that Acton travelled abroad for the good of her health, because she had a weak constitution.{{sfn|Ray|2008}} It is possible that she was pregnant when she left for Paris and that she went abroad to give birth to an [[illegitimate]] daughter.{{sfn|Quayle|1978|p=165}}{{sfn|Freeman|1989|p=159}}{{efn|Because of the stigma surrounding [[unintended pregnancies]] out of wedlock, it was common for middle-class women to move away from home to a relative's house, or abroad, to have the child, which was then adopted by a married relative.{{sfn|Hardy|2011|pp=72\u201373}}}} The food writers Mary Aylett and Olive Ordish theorise that Acton's child was raised by Sarah, Eliza's sister. The two observe that \"there is no evidence for this, other than family tradition\".{{sfn|Aylett|Ordish|1965|pp=180\u2013181}} Hardy dismisses the theory, stating that Acton did not have a sister called Sarah, let alone one who was married (none of Acton's sisters were married); she also observes that she has found no baptismal or census record that would account for a child of the right age.{{sfn|Hardy|2011|p=72}} While in France Acton had an unhappy relationship with a French army officer;{{sfn|Ray|2008}} it is possible there was an engagement, but if so it was broken off. She returned to England, probably in 1826.{{sfn|Aylett|Ordish|1965|p=181}}{{sfn|Hardy|2011|p=63}}\n\n===Poet===\n[[File:The Red House, Bordyke - geograph.org.uk - 2342303.jpg|thumb|Bordyke House (now Red House), near Tonbridge]]\nActon had been writing poetry since at least 1822, as she wrote that year on the bottom of one of her poems.{{efn|Only five of her existing poems are dated, the first in 1822, the last in May 1826. There is no record of when the others were written.{{sfn|Hardy|2011|p=54}}}} She wrote at least one while in France, \"On Approaching Paris\", which she dated 1826.{{sfn|Hardy|2011|pp=54\u201356}} When she returned to England, she arranged for a collection to be published by [[Longman]].{{sfn|Ray|2008}} As was the practice for publishers at the time, Acton had to provide the names of subscribers\u2014those who had pre-paid for a copy\u2014who were listed inside the work; nearly all came from Suffolk. 328 copies were printed in October 1826 and a reprint was needed within a month.{{sfn|Hardy|2011|pp=58\u201359}} She subsequently wrote some longer poems, including \"The Chronicles of Castel Framlingham\", which was printed in the ''Sudbury Chronicle'' in 1838, and \"The Voice of the North\", which was written in 1842 on the occasion of [[Queen Victoria]]'s first visit to Scotland.{{sfn|Ray|2008}} Other poems were published in a local periodical, the ''Sudbury Pocket Book''.{{sfn|Aylett|Ordish|1965|p=181}}\n\nIn 1827 John Acton was declared [[bankrupt]], and the company in which he was a partner was dissolved; one of his business partners was involved in the claim against him. The [[Commissioner of Bankruptcy]] ordered John to surrender himself to the Office of the Commissioners to disclose his wealth, but he fled to France.{{efn|The practice of bankrupts evading their creditors by going into exile in France was not uncommon; Nelson's mistress, [[Emma, Lady Hamilton]], had done so in 1814.{{sfn|Hardy|2011|p=78}}}} In his absence his family moved into Bordyke House, near [[Tonbridge]], [[Kent]], where Elizabeth Acton, Eliza's mother, turned the large building into a boarding house for [[upper class]] guests, particularly for those who wanted to visit [[Royal Tunbridge Wells]] and enjoy the [[spa]] facilities there.{{sfn|Hardy|2011|pp=77\u201382}} It is likely that Elizabeth left Bordyke House around 1841, although her daughter remained in residence.{{sfn|Hardy|2011|pp=86 and 89}}\n\n===Cookery writer===\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align    = right\n| direction = vertical\n| header = Illustrations from the 1845 edition of ''[[Modern Cookery for Private Families]]''\n| width    =\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = Beef cuts - Acton, Modern Cookery, page 169.jpg\n| width1    = 170\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = Information on ingredients, including cuts of beef\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    = Copper Fish or Ham Kettle Eliza Acton.jpg\n| width2    = 170\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = Details of cooking equipment, including a copper kettle for ham or fish\n<!-- Image 3 -->\n| image3    = Eliza Acton Orange Jellies 1845.jpg\n| width3    = 170\n| alt3      =\n| caption3  = Examples of presentation, including Oranges filled with Jelly\n}}\n{{further|Modern Cookery for Private Families}}\n\nAt some point\u2014Hardy considers 1835; Aylett and Ordish consider 1837\u2014Acton sent a further set of poems to Longman for publishing.

A chapter covers [[curries]] (and [[potted meat]]s), and gives recipes for Eastern \"[[chutney|chatneys]]\" (chutney), treating them as a naturalised Anglo-Indian dish, rather than of solely Indian origin, according to the professor of English literature Susan Zlotnick.{{sfn|Zlotnick|1996|pp=59\u201360}} The book contains the first recipe for [[brussels sprout]]s,{{sfn|Snodgrass|2004}} and the first use in an English cookery book of the word ''spaghetti''\u2014which she spelled ''sparghetti''.{{sfn|Walker|2013|p=57}}{{sfn|\"Spaghetti\".

With the inclusion of timings and ingredients, ''Modern Cookery'' differed from other cookery books, and was a development of Acton's own.{{sfn|Ray|2008}} Acton wrote that each recipe had been cooked and \"proved beneath our own roof and under our own personal inspection\".{{sfn|Acton|1845|p=x}} The food historian Sarah Freeman describes the cooking instructions Acton produced as being written \"so conscientiously, and with such gastronomic sensitivity, that&nbsp;... [''Modern Cookery''] was as much a work of art on food as it was functional\".{{sfn|Freeman|1989|p=160}}\n\nThe reviews for ''Modern Cookery'' were positive,{{sfn|Hardy|2011|pp=100\u2013101}} and the critic from ''[[The Morning Post]]'' considered it \"unquestionably the most valuable compendium of the art that has yet been published\".{{sfn|\"Literature\", ''The Morning Post''}} The review in ''[[The Spectator]]'' stated that the order of the book was \"very natural\", while \"the methods are clearly described, and seem founded on chemical principles\";{{sfn|\"Literature Received\", ''The Spectator''}} the reviewer for the ''[[Kentish Gazette]]'' also commended the clarity of the instructions, and the inclusion of ingredients and timings.{{sfn|\"Modern Cookery\", ''Kentish Gazette''}} The unnamed critic for ''[[The Atlas (newspaper)|The Atlas]]'' described the layout for the recipes to be \"excellent\"{{sfn|\"Literary Memoranda\", ''The Atlas''}} and, in a positive review in ''The Exeter and Plymouth Gazette'', praise was given to \"the intelligibility of the instructions which are given\", which contrasted with other cookery books.{{sfn|\"Literature\", ''Woolmer's Exeter and Plymouth Gazette''}}\n\nA second edition of ''Modern Cookery'' was released in May 1845, containing corrections and updates; Longmans also released this version in the US, through the Philadelphia company of Lea & Blanchard.{{sfn|Hardy|2011|p=133}} The book sold well, and in June 1845 Longmans sent Acton \u00a367 11[[shilling|s]] 2d as her share of the profits.{{efn|\u00a367 11s 2d refers to the [[\u00a3sd|pre-decimal system]] used in Britain prior to February 1971.{{sfn|Freeman|2011}}}} In subsequent years she earned \u00a3162 in 1846 and \u00a3189 in 1847, when she was being paid half the profits; in 1849 she dropped to quarter of the profits and received \u00a383.{{sfn|Hardy|2011|p=137}}{{efn|\u00a367 in 1845 equates to approximately \u00a36,000 in 2018; \u00a3162 in 1846 equates to approximately \u00a314,400; \u00a3189 in 1847 equates to approximately \u00a315,850 and \u00a383 in 1849 equates to approximately \u00a37,650, according to calculations based on [[Consumer Price Index (United Kingdom)|Consumer Price Index]] measure of inflation.{{inflation-fn|UK|df=yes}}}}\n\nSome time after ''Modern Cookery'' was published, Acton moved from Tonbridge to [[Hampstead]], north west London.

Hardy also sees in the poems an \"almost masculine intensity and depth of feeling\".{{sfn|Hardy|2011|pp=61\u201364}} O'Brien sees humour in some of Acton's poetry, and cites \"Come To My Grave\"\u2014a work about \"a mildly acerbic and witty potential revenant, musing on revenge\"\u2014as a parody of a love lyric with [[Gothic fiction|Gothic romantic]] overtones.{{sfn|O'Brien|2012|pp=47\u201348}}\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nCome to my grave when I am gone,\nAnd bend a moment there alone;\nIt will not cost thee much of pain\nTo trample on my heart again\u2013\nOr, if it would, for ever stay\nFar distant from my mouldering clay:\nI would not wound thy breast to prove\nE'en its most deep, 'remorse of love.'\nThe grave should be a shrine of peace\nWhere all unkindly feelings cease;\u2013\nThough thou wilt calmly gaze on mine\nI would not live the hour to see,\nWhich doom'd my glance to rest on thine:\u2013\nThat moment's bitter agony\nWould bid the very life-blood start\nBack, and congeal around my heart!\u2013{{sfn|Acton|1826|pp=89\u201390}}\n</poem></blockquote>\n\n===Cookery===\n[[File:English Bread frontispiece 2.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece of ''The English Bread Book'', 1857]]\nO'Brien sees that, through the high quality of Acton's prose, ''Modern Cookery'' is a unique cultural document.{{sfn|O'Brien|2012|p=45}} As the food writer [[Elizabeth David]] writes,\n\n<blockquote>[Acton's]&nbsp;... book was the final expression&nbsp;... of pre-Industrial England's taste in food and attitude to cookery. The dishes she describes and the ingredients which went into them would have been familiar to [[Jane Austen]] and [[Lord Byron]], to [[Fanny Burnley]] and [[Tobias Smollett]].{{sfn|David|1974|p=xxix}}</blockquote>\n\nMany of the dishes Acton describes belong, according to David, to the 18th century and, with increasing industrialisation and urbanisation of the 19th century, the staple foods described were already being replaced. David cites the example of [[Bird's Custard Powder]], launched in 1840, as an example of the radical changes being introduced to cooking.{{sfn|David|1974|p=xxix}} Acton adopted some of the changes in food science into the 1855 re-write of the book, including the developments of [[Justus von Liebig]]\u2014the developer of the [[Oxo (food)|Oxo]] brand beef [[stock cube]]\u2014and [[William Gregory (chemist)|William Gregory]], Liebig's pupil and translator.{{sfn|Lieffers|2012|p=946}}\n\nActon, in her preface to ''Modern Cookery'', writes that her \"first and best attention has been bestowed on&nbsp;... what are usually termed plain English dishes\" for her recipes,{{sfn|Acton|1845|p=31}} and Christopher Driver, the journalist and food critic, considers the book \"as English as&nbsp;... [its] eighteenth-century predecessors\".{{sfn|Driver|1983|p=6}} Elizabeth Ray observes that while Acton \"is basically a very English cook\", many of the recipes are labelled as French dishes, and foreign food is given its own chapter.{{sfn|Ray|1974|p=xix}} These are recipes from the cuisines of Indian, Syria, Turkey, Italy, Germany, Portugal, Mauritius, Switzerland and the West Indies.{{sfn|Freeman|1989|p=162}}{{sfn|Acton|1855|pp=605\u2013622}} Acton was willing to learn from foreign food cultures, and wrote \"Without adopting blindly foreign modes in anything merely because they ''are'' foreign, surely we should be wise to learn from other nations\".{{sfn|Acton|1855|p=xi}} Similarly, ''The English Bread Book'' was focused on British bread and, in her preface, Acton wrote \"Bread is a first necessity of life to the great mass of the English people; being in part the food of all\u2014the chief food of many\u2014and almost the sole food of many more.\"{{sfn|Acton|1857|p=v}} She devotes a whole chapter to the approach to bread and bread-making in France, Germany and Belgium, and the book contains recipes for German [[pumpernickel]], French [[baguette]]s, Italian [[polenta]] bread, Turkish rolls and Indian breads.{{sfn|Acton|1857|pp=29, 141, 161, 166, 168 and 177}}\n\nThe food historian Bob Ashley identifies that the strongest theme in ''Modern Cookery'' is economy in food, although this is also tempered by Acton's advice to reject dubious ingredients.{{sfn|Ashley|2004|p=158}}{{sfn|David|1974|p=xxviii}} In her preface to the book, Acton writes that \"It may be safely averred that good cookery is the best and truest economy, turning to full account every wholesome article of food, and converting into palatable meals what the ignorant either render uneatable or throw away in disdain\".{{sfn|Acton1855|p=viii}} She provides a recipe for \"Elegant Economist's Pudding\", which uses left-over Christmas pudding;{{sfn|Acton|1845|p=380}} when giving a recipe for \"Superlative Hare Soup\", she also provides one for \"A Less Expensive Hare Soup\".{{sfn|Acton|1845|pp=31\u201332}}{{efn|The superlative soup includes a hare, ham, [[Mace (spice)|mace]] and half a [[imperial pint|pint]] (280 ml) of [[Port wine|port]]; ingredients for the less expensive version include beef, hare and a bunch of savoury herbs.{{sfn|Acton|1845|pp=31\u201332}}}} The social historian [[John Burnett (historian)|John Burnet]] observes that although the dishes were supposedly aimed at middle-class families of modest income, the book contains recipes that include truffles in champagne, soles in cream and a pie of venison and hare.{{sfn|Burnett|1964}}{{efn|The recipes are, respectively: \"Truffles with Champagne, A La Serviette\" which, Acton writes, is so expensive as to only be served by the wealthy;{{sfn|Acton|1845|p=322}} \"Soles Stewed in Cream\"\u2014the recipe uses half to a pint (280\u2013570 ml) of \"as much sweet rich cream as will cover&nbsp;... [the fillets]\"\u2014Acton notes that a Cornish alternative uses clotted cream;{{sfn|Acton|1845|pp=59\u201360}} and \"A Good Common English Game Pie\"\u2014Acton lists truffled sausage meat an optional ingredient.{{sfn|Acton|1845|pp=342\u2013343}}}}\n\nThe food writer [[Alan Davidson (food writer)|Alan Davidson]] considers ''Modern Cookery'' to be \"among the most elegantly written (and practical) cookery books ever published\".{{sfn|Davidson|1983|p=104}} Nicola Humble, in her book on the history of British cookery books, writes that Acton provides \"the quirky, confident perspective of the expert\" in text that is \"alive with adjectives and opinions&nbsp;... the prose enthuses and evokes\".{{sfn|Humble|2006|p=11}} In 1968 Elizabeth David wrote that Acton's recipes were both illuminating and decisive. Examining a 100-word paragraph in ''Modern Cookery'' for instructions on beating egg whites for a sponge cake, David considers it superior to an eight-page piece on the same topic in the 1927 work ''[[La bonne cuisine de Madame E. Saint-Ange]]''.{{sfn|David|1974|p=xxviii}}\n\nThere is humour in Acton's work, particularly when reporting on a recipe going wrong.{{sfn|O'Brien|2012|pp=45\u201346}}{{sfn|Colquhoun|2008|p=281}}{{sfn|Hughes|2006|p=212}} Her recipe for Publisher's Pudding, which contains [[cognac]], [[macaroon]]s, cream and almonds, \"can scarcely be made ''too rich''\",{{sfn|Acton|1845|p=374}} while the Poor Author's Pudding is made with milk, bread, eggs and sugar, and is a more simple dish.{{sfn|Acton|1845|pp=407\u2013408}} Similarly, in her recipe for Superior Pine-Apple Marmalade, she writes that if the mixture is placed onto a direct heat it \"will often convert what would otherwise be excellent preserve, into a strange sort of compound, for which it is difficult to find a name\".{{sfn|Acton|1855|pp=513\u2013514}}\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Game cuts - Acton, Modern Cookery, page 271.jpg|thumb|Cuts of [[Game (hunting)|game]], from ''Modern Cookery'']]\n''Modern Cookery'' remained in print until 1918, when its popularity waned in the face of competition from other books and Longmans took the decision not to republish.{{sfn|David|1974|p=xxx}} Acton's works remained out of print until 1968 when a selection of her recipes was collected into ''The Best of Eliza Acton'', edited by Elizabeth Ray and including an introduction by Elizabeth David. ''Modern Cookery'' was not reprinted in full until 1994,{{sfn|Davidson|2014|p=4}} although ''The English Bread Book'' was reprinted in 1990.{{sfn|\"Resources\", ''The Digest''}}\n\nIn 1857, when [[Isabella Beeton]] began writing the cookery column for ''[[The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine]]'', many of the recipes were [[plagiarised]] from ''Modern Cookery''.{{sfn|Aylett|Ordish|1965|p=224}} In 1861 Isabella's husband, [[Samuel Orchart Beeton|Samuel]], published ''[[Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management]]'', which also contained several of Acton's recipes.{{sfn|Hughes|2006|p=282}}{{efn|Acton's work was not the only one to be copied by the Beetons. Other cookery books plagiarised include [[Elizabeth Raffald]]'s ''[[The Experienced English Housekeeper]]'', [[Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame]]'s ''Le P\u00e2tissier royal parisien'',{{sfn|Broomfield|2008|p=104}} [[Louis Eustache Ude]]'s ''The French Cook'', [[Alexis Soyer]]'s ''The Modern Housewife or, M\u00e9nag\u00e8re'' and ''The Pantropheon'', [[Hannah Glasse]]'s ''[[The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy]]'', [[Maria Eliza Rundell]]'s ''[[A New System of Domestic Cookery]]'' and the works of [[Charles Elm\u00e9 Francatelli]].{{sfn|Hughes|2006|pp=198\u2013201, 206\u2013210}}{{sfn|Hughes|2014}}{{sfn|Brown|2006}}}} Isabella Beeton's biographer [[Kathryn Hughes]] gives as examples one third of Beeton's soup dishes and a quarter of her fish recipes, which are all taken from Acton.{{sfn|Hughes|2006|p=213}} In her works, Isabella Beeton partly followed the new layout of Acton's recipes, although with a major alteration: whereas ''Modern Cookery'' provides the method of cooking followed by a list of the required ingredients, the recipes in ''The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine'' and ''Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management'' list the timings and components before the cooking process.{{sfn|Freeman|1977|p=76}}\n\nThe food historian [[Bee Wilson]] considers many modern cookery writers to be indebted to Acton and her work.{{sfn|Wilson|2011}} Elizabeth David wrote in 1977 that ''The English Bread Book'' was a major influence on and source for her own ''English Bread and Yeast Cookery'', and that she owes Acton a debt for it;{{sfn|David|2001|p=xiii}} David also describes ''Modern Cookery'' as \"the greatest cookery book in our language\".{{sfn|David|1974|p=xxx}} The cook [[Delia Smith]] is of a similar opinion, and describes Acton as \"the best cookery writer in the English language\".{{sfn|Smith|2011|p=7}} The cookery writer [[Jane Grigson]] was influenced by Acton, particularly when she wrote ''English Food'' (1974),{{sfn|Cooke|2015}} while the chef [[Rick Stein]] included her \"Soles Stewed in Cream\" in his cookery book ''Seafood Lovers' Guide'' (2000).{{sfn|Stein|2003}}\n\n==Notes and

Hakkapeliitta is a 19th-century Finnish modification of a contemporary name given by foreigners in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and variously spelled as Hackapelit, Hackapelite, Hackapell, Haccapelit, or Haccapelite.

They typically had a [[sword]], a [[helmet]], and leather armor or a breastplate of steel. They would attack at a full [[Horse gait|gallop]], fire the first pistol at twenty paces and the second at five paces, and then draw the sword.

The event was well received among fans of the Yogscast, although Brindley has mentioned during a livestream that the convention was not profitable due to some sponsors dropping out, presumably due to the controversies surrounding the allegations of some of the members around the same period.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.twitch.tv/yogscast/clip/EndearingDullOysterKAPOW |title=The end of Yogscast |website=Twitch |access-date=2019-09-02}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2020|01|06|df=}}, the main Yogscast YouTube channel has 7,210,000 subscribers, 4,130,137,799 video views, and featured 33 other YouTube channels,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/user/BlueXephos |title=YOGSCAST Lewis & Simon |website=YouTube |access-date=6 January 2020}}</ref> while the Yogscast Twitch channel has 874,442 followers and a total of 115,236,751 video views.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.twitch.tv/yogscast |title=Yogscast - Twitch |website=Twitch |access-date=17 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Productions ==\n=== Video series ===\n==== ''World of Warcraft'' ====\nThe Yogscast's ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' videos were the first videos released by The Yogscast and largely took the form of parodic [[how-to]] videos. In July 2010, Brindley and Lane also began a series of play-through videos previewing the ''[[World of Warcraft: Cataclysm|Cataclysm]]'' [[expansion pack]]'s [[closed beta]]. Much of The Yogscast's initial popularity was due to media and blog coverage of these videos, with [[Joystiq]] (later becoming [[Engadget]]) regularly covering them as they were released.<ref name=pcgamer-print /><ref name=\"wow_insider\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/tag/yogscast/ |title=Topic: yogscast articles |publisher=Engadget |access-date=9 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==== ''Minecraft'' ====\nOne of the most popular video features of The Yogscast are their many ''[[Minecraft]]'' series.<ref name=salon /> In December 2010, Brindley and Lane began an ongoing series of [[Let's Play (video gaming)|Let's Play]]-style ''Minecraft'' survival multiplayer videos.<ref name=gotgame /> As the series progressed, however, it evolved into a semi-improvised comedy drama named ''Shadow of Israphel''. This new series led to a boom in the number of the group's YouTube subscribers and was a major contributing factor in their rise to fame. The last instalment, episode 42, was released in July 2012. The series has been put on hold since and has not been officially cancelled, although its indefinite hiatus remains a recurring joke amongst The Yogscast and their audience.\n\nSince then, they have also produced other narrative-driven series set in ''Minecraft'', often with the use of modpacks like ''Tekkit'', such as ''Jaffa Factory'', ''YogLabs'', ''MoonQuest'' and ''Hole Diggers'' which have also attracted a large audience.\n\nAnother of Brindley and Lane's ''Minecraft'' series also involved them playing and bumbling through different player-made adventure maps,<ref name=\"salon\" /> showcasing different maps made by the player community.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/yogscast-try-out-minecrafts-quirkiest-mod-maps/ |title=Yogscast try out Minecraft's quirkiest mod maps |last=Senior |first=Tom |date=24 June 2011 |work=PC Gamer |access-date=13 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217024136/https://www.pcgamer.com/yogscast-try-out-minecrafts-quirkiest-mod-maps/ |archive-date=17 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2011, The Yogscast curated and released a collection of ''Minecraft'' mods which they named the \"Yogbox\".<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/yogbox-bundles-minecrafts-best-mods-into-one-download/ |title=Yogbox bundles Minecraft's best mods into one download |last=Senior |first=Tom |date=29 June 2011 |work=PC Gamer |access-date=13 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205181637/https://www.pcgamer.com/yogbox-bundles-minecrafts-best-mods-into-one-download/ |archive-date=5 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n==== Live Action ====\nThe Yogscast have participated and produced their own large-scale live action series. The most common of these are the group's coverage of various [[gaming convention]]s, as well as [[Role-playing game|RPG]] sessions and studio-promoted \"challenge\" videos. Other notable live action productions include a discussion with television and radio presenter [[Jonathan Ross]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.yogscast.com/video/xGVXPvdmNCsz/search/Simon+Meets/page/0 |title=Simon Meets Jonathan Ross |access-date=16 September 2015}}</ref> a [[mockumentary]]-style interview with actor [[Warwick Davis]],<ref>{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Vt9EMroU74 |title=When Simon met Warwick - Part 1 |date=25 October 2012 |type=Video |publisher=The Yogscast |access-date=1 September 2018 |website=YouTube}}</ref> an interview with [[Sigourney Weaver]], a promotional project with [[Peter Molyneux]], and a series of promotional live action sketches with [[Ubisoft]], [[Electronic Arts|EA]], [[Microsoft]], the [[BBC]], [[Lucasfilm]], [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], [[Universal Studios]], [[Blizzard Entertainment]], [[Sony]], and some smaller indie developers.\n\n=== Podcasts ===\n====''YoGPoD''====\n{{Infobox podcast\n| title = YoGPoD\n| image = \n| image_size = \n| italic title = no\n| hosting = Lewis Brindley<br/>Simon Lane\n| genre = [[Video game culture|Gaming]], [[Comedy]]\n| updates = \n| length = 15 \u2013 120 minutes\n| language = [[English language|English]]\n| camera = \n| direction = \n| picture_format = \n| list_episodes = <!--If a Wikipedia \"List of\" article exists for the show's episodes, put its name here.

Along with hosts Brindley and Lane, it often featured other members of their ''World of Warcraft'' guild, and was initially released with a proposed weekly schedule. Releases became more sporadic over time, however, to the point that \"YoGPoD 42: Strawnana\" came out on 4 July 2012, 5 months after its predecessor. A Halloween-themed YoGPoD, \"YoGPoD 44: Halloween Spack-2-cular\" was released on 28 October 2012, followed by \"YoGPoD 45: Halloween Spack-3-cular\" on 30 October 2013. Following the 2013 Halloween YoGPoD, there was a short run of releases from October 2015 to January 2016, before the schedule paused again.\n\nOn 9 July 2018, a surprise Halloween-themed episode entitled \"YoGPoD 51: Halloween Spack-10-cular\" was released to celebrate a decade of Yogscast content.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.gamespew.com/2018/07/the-yogpod-is-back-to-celebrate-10-years-of-yogscast-nonsense/ |title=The YoGPoD is Back to Celebrate 10 Years of Yogscast Nonsense |last=Gammon |first=Robert |date=16 July 2018 |work=GameSpew |access-date=20 October 2018}}</ref> Despite the name, it was recorded and released far from Halloween.\n\nThe ''YoGPoD'' has no strict structure, but one of the more prominent features has Lane impersonate public figures that Brindley then \"interviews\".

It was first released on 23 March 2016. The podcast is posted alongside ''The YoGPoD'' and features the trio talking about various ideas centred on gaming but also expand to current topics and sporadic thoughts. The structure of the podcast is fairly loose, with an introduction, miscellaneous topics, a gaming section, a reading from Pyrion Flax's homebrew fiction \"Bodega\" (Episode 19 to Episode 43) and in the early episodes, a Q and A from Twitter followers at the close of the podcast.\n\nIn 2017, the official ''YoGPoD'' YouTube channel was rebranded for the ''Triforce!'' podcast. A spinoff [[audiobook]] style series, titled ''Bodega'', was also debuted.\nThe series features excerpts of the regular ''Triforce!'', podcast where Pyrion Flax narrates his homebrew fanfiction.\n\n=== Live broadcasts ===\n{{further|The Yogscast#Charity initiatives}}\n\nThe '''''Yogscast Jingle Jam''''' is a series of live streams that are shown over the course of December each year with the intention to raise money for charity.\n\n'''''High Rollers D&D''''' is a ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' series being played on the Sunday Tabletop RPG Show, part of the daily Yogscast live stream schedule. The show is broadcast live on the Yogscast Twitch channel on Sundays from 5pm GMT. It is the largest Dungeons and Dragons livestream in Europe, and has partnered with [[Wizards of the Coast]] on several miniseries.\n\nThe '''''Yogscast Poker Nights''''' is a series of poker games broadcast live on Twitch. In May 2018, The Yogscast signed a six-episode sponsorship deal with [[KamaGames]] to promote the latter's ''Pokerist'' app on the live stream.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.igamingbusiness.com/news/kamagames-partners-yogscast|title=KamaGames partners with \"The Yogscast\"|work=iGaming Business|date=31 May 2018|access-date=8 November 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Charity initiatives ==\n[[File:Yogscast win at the Oxfam JustGiving Awards 2012.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The Yogscast at JustGiving Awards 2012, accepting the award for Most Popular Fundraiser.]]\n\nSince 2011, The Yogscast have organised a series of live streams every year in December to benefit charity.

The event was well received among fans of the Yogscast, although Brindley has mentioned during a livestream that the convention was not profitable due to some sponsors dropping out, presumably due to the controversies surrounding the allegations of some of the members around the same period.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.twitch.tv/yogscast/clip/EndearingDullOysterKAPOW |title=The end of Yogscast |website=Twitch |access-date=2019-09-02}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2020|01|06|df=}}, the main Yogscast YouTube channel has 7,210,000 subscribers, 4,130,137,799 video views, and featured 33 other YouTube channels,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/user/BlueXephos |title=YOGSCAST Lewis & Simon |website=YouTube |access-date=6 January 2020}}</ref> while the Yogscast Twitch channel has 874,442 followers and a total of 115,236,751 video views.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.twitch.tv/yogscast |title=Yogscast - Twitch |website=Twitch |access-date=17 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Productions ==\n=== Video series ===\n==== ''World of Warcraft'' ====\nThe Yogscast's ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' videos were the first videos released by The Yogscast and largely took the form of parodic [[how-to]] videos. In July 2010, Brindley and Lane also began a series of play-through videos previewing the ''[[World of Warcraft: Cataclysm|Cataclysm]]'' [[expansion pack]]'s [[closed beta]]. Much of The Yogscast's initial popularity was due to media and blog coverage of these videos, with [[Joystiq]] (later becoming [[Engadget]]) regularly covering them as they were released.<ref name=pcgamer-print /><ref name=\"wow_insider\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/tag/yogscast/ |title=Topic: yogscast articles |publisher=Engadget |access-date=9 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==== ''Minecraft'' ====\nOne of the most popular video features of The Yogscast are their many ''[[Minecraft]]'' series.<ref name=salon /> In December 2010, Brindley and Lane began an ongoing series of [[Let's Play (video gaming)|Let's Play]]-style ''Minecraft'' survival multiplayer videos.<ref name=gotgame /> As the series progressed, however, it evolved into a semi-improvised comedy drama named ''Shadow of Israphel''. This new series led to a boom in the number of the group's YouTube subscribers and was a major contributing factor in their rise to fame. The last instalment, episode 42, was released in July 2012. The series has been put on hold since and has not been officially cancelled, although its indefinite hiatus remains a recurring joke amongst The Yogscast and their audience.\n\nSince then, they have also produced other narrative-driven series set in ''Minecraft'', often with the use of modpacks like ''Tekkit'', such as ''Jaffa Factory'', ''YogLabs'', ''MoonQuest'' and ''Hole Diggers'' which have also attracted a large audience.\n\nAnother of Brindley and Lane's ''Minecraft'' series also involved them playing and bumbling through different player-made adventure maps,<ref name=\"salon\" /> showcasing different maps made by the player community.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/yogscast-try-out-minecrafts-quirkiest-mod-maps/ |title=Yogscast try out Minecraft's quirkiest mod maps |last=Senior |first=Tom |date=24 June 2011 |work=PC Gamer |access-date=13 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217024136/https://www.pcgamer.com/yogscast-try-out-minecrafts-quirkiest-mod-maps/ |archive-date=17 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2011, The Yogscast curated and released a collection of ''Minecraft'' mods which they named the \"Yogbox\".<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/yogbox-bundles-minecrafts-best-mods-into-one-download/ |title=Yogbox bundles Minecraft's best mods into one download |last=Senior |first=Tom |date=29 June 2011 |work=PC Gamer |access-date=13 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205181637/https://www.pcgamer.com/yogbox-bundles-minecrafts-best-mods-into-one-download/ |archive-date=5 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n==== Live Action ====\nThe Yogscast have participated and produced their own large-scale live action series. The most common of these are the group's coverage of various [[gaming convention]]s, as well as [[Role-playing game|RPG]] sessions and studio-promoted \"challenge\" videos. Other notable live action productions include a discussion with television and radio presenter [[Jonathan Ross]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.yogscast.com/video/xGVXPvdmNCsz/search/Simon+Meets/page/0 |title=Simon Meets Jonathan Ross |access-date=16 September 2015}}</ref> a [[mockumentary]]-style interview with actor [[Warwick Davis]],<ref>{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Vt9EMroU74 |title=When Simon met Warwick - Part 1 |date=25 October 2012 |type=Video |publisher=The Yogscast |access-date=1 September 2018 |website=YouTube}}</ref> an interview with [[Sigourney Weaver]], a promotional project with [[Peter Molyneux]], and a series of promotional live action sketches with [[Ubisoft]], [[Electronic Arts|EA]], [[Microsoft]], the [[BBC]], [[Lucasfilm]], [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], [[Universal Studios]], [[Blizzard Entertainment]], [[Sony]], and some smaller indie developers.\n\n=== Podcasts ===\n====''YoGPoD''====\n{{Infobox podcast\n| title = YoGPoD\n| image = \n| image_size = \n| italic title = no\n| hosting = Lewis Brindley<br/>Simon Lane\n| genre = [[Video game culture|Gaming]], [[Comedy]]\n| updates = \n| length = 15 \u2013 120 minutes\n| language = [[English language|English]]\n| camera = \n| direction = \n| picture_format = \n| list_episodes = <!--If a Wikipedia \"List of\" article exists for the show's episodes, put its name here.

Along with hosts Brindley and Lane, it often featured other members of their ''World of Warcraft'' guild, and was initially released with a proposed weekly schedule. Releases became more sporadic over time, however, to the point that \"YoGPoD 42: Strawnana\" came out on 4 July 2012, 5 months after its predecessor. A Halloween-themed YoGPoD, \"YoGPoD 44: Halloween Spack-2-cular\" was released on 28 October 2012, followed by \"YoGPoD 45: Halloween Spack-3-cular\" on 30 October 2013. Following the 2013 Halloween YoGPoD, there was a short run of releases from October 2015 to January 2016, before the schedule paused again.\n\nOn 9 July 2018, a surprise Halloween-themed episode entitled \"YoGPoD 51: Halloween Spack-10-cular\" was released to celebrate a decade of Yogscast content.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.gamespew.com/2018/07/the-yogpod-is-back-to-celebrate-10-years-of-yogscast-nonsense/ |title=The YoGPoD is Back to Celebrate 10 Years of Yogscast Nonsense |last=Gammon |first=Robert |date=16 July 2018 |work=GameSpew |access-date=20 October 2018}}</ref> Despite the name, it was recorded and released far from Halloween.\n\nThe ''YoGPoD'' has no strict structure, but one of the more prominent features has Lane impersonate public figures that Brindley then \"interviews\".

It was first released on 23 March 2016. The podcast is posted alongside ''The YoGPoD'' and features the trio talking about various ideas centred on gaming but also expand to current topics and sporadic thoughts. The structure of the podcast is fairly loose, with an introduction, miscellaneous topics, a gaming section, a reading from Pyrion Flax's homebrew fiction \"Bodega\" (Episode 19 to Episode 43) and in the early episodes, a Q and A from Twitter followers at the close of the podcast.\n\nIn 2017, the official ''YoGPoD'' YouTube channel was rebranded for the ''Triforce!'' podcast. A spinoff [[audiobook]] style series, titled ''Bodega'', was also debuted.\nThe series features excerpts of the regular ''Triforce!'', podcast where Pyrion Flax narrates his homebrew fanfiction.\n\n=== Live broadcasts ===\n{{further|The Yogscast#Charity initiatives}}\n\nThe '''''Yogscast Jingle Jam''''' is a series of live streams that are shown over the course of December each year with the intention to raise money for charity.\n\n'''''High Rollers D&D''''' is a ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' series being played on the Sunday Tabletop RPG Show, part of the daily Yogscast live stream schedule. The show is broadcast live on the Yogscast Twitch channel on Sundays from 5pm GMT. It is the largest Dungeons and Dragons livestream in Europe, and has partnered with [[Wizards of the Coast]] on several miniseries.\n\nThe '''''Yogscast Poker Nights''''' is a series of poker games broadcast live on Twitch. In May 2018, The Yogscast signed a six-episode sponsorship deal with [[KamaGames]] to promote the latter's ''Pokerist'' app on the live stream.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.igamingbusiness.com/news/kamagames-partners-yogscast|title=KamaGames partners with \"The Yogscast\"|work=iGaming Business|date=31 May 2018|access-date=8 November 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Charity initiatives ==\n[[File:Yogscast win at the Oxfam JustGiving Awards 2012.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The Yogscast at JustGiving Awards 2012, accepting the award for Most Popular Fundraiser.]]\n\nSince 2011, The Yogscast have organised a series of live streams every year in December to benefit charity.

''Star Trek'' remained an important slash fiction fandom, while new slash fandoms grew around other television shows, movies, and books with sci-fi or action adventure roots.\n\nEarly slash fans in England feared that they would be arrested, because slash violated the obscenity laws there at the time.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Falzone|first1=P.J.|title=The Final Frontier Is Queer: Aberrancy, Archetype and Audience Generated Folklore in K/S Slashfiction|journal=[[Western Folklore]]|date=2005|volume=64|issue=3/4|pages=243\u2013261|jstor=25474751}}</ref>\n\n===Slash sources===\nFrom its earliest days, slash fiction has been particularly inspired by popular [[speculative fiction]] franchises,<ref>[[David Seed]] Ed., ''A Companion to Science Fiction'', \"Science Fiction/Criticism\" p. 57, {{ISBN|1-4051-1218-2}}</ref><ref name=CHot20thcent798/> possibly because well-developed female characters may be lacking in speculative fiction, or because the speculative elements allow greater freedom to reinterpret canon characters. However, other large fandoms, such as ''Starsky and Hutch'' or ''The Professionals'', are based in non-speculative sources.\n\nSlash fiction follows popular media, and new stories are constantly produced. There is some correlation between the popularity and activity within each fandom and that of the source of the material. Slash fiction readers and writers tend to adhere closely to the canonical source of their fiction, and create a [[fandom]] for that particular source. However, some participants follow the slash content created by a certain [[fandom]] without being fans of the original source material itself.<ref>Green, Shoshanna, Cynthia Jenkings and Henry Jenkins. \"Normal Female Interest in Men Bonking: Selections From 'The Terra Nostra Underground' and 'Strange Bedfellows'.\" Ed.

With the advent of the internet, the slash fiction community of fans and writers created mailing lists (which gradually took the place of [[Amateur Press Association|APA]]s), and websites such as [[fanfiction.net]],<ref name=CHot20thcent798>{{cite book |title=The Cambridge history of twentieth-century English literature |last= Laura |first= Marcus|authorlink= |author2=Peter Nicholls |year=2004 |publisher= Cambridge University Press|page= 798|isbn=978-0-521-82077-6}}</ref> (which gradually started taking the place of zines). Forum boards and message boards were active during the first half of the millennium, where sites like Angelfire and ProBoards were quite successful. Other venus where slash was and still is publish is Facebook, in private groups. Much later came [[Archive of Our Own]]. As slash publishing gradually moved to the internet, the field became open to more writers, and a greater quantity of material was published.\n\nThe internet allowed slash authors more freedom: stories could include branching storylines, links, collages, songmixes, and other innovations. The internet increased slash visibility, and the number of readers, who were now able to access the stories from their own home at a much lower cost (the price of zines vs. the price of internet connections). The number of [[fandom]]s represented increased dramatically, especially those devoted to science fiction, fantasy, and police dramas.<ref name=\"Kustritz\" /> The internet also increased the level of interaction \u2013 making it easier for fans to comment on stories, give episode reviews, and [[meta|discuss]] and comment on trends in slash fandom itself. Websites and fanzines dedicated to fandoms such as ''[[The X-Files]]'', ''[[Stargate]]'', ''[[Harry Potter]]'', and ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' became common, with tens of thousands of slash stories available.<ref name=CHot20thcent798/>\n\n==Critical and queer attention==\n<!--discussing the academic theories on slash goes here - see yaoi or romance novel articles for examples of how this should look-->\nSlash fiction has received more academic attention than other genres of fan fiction.<ref name=CHot20thcent799/> Slash fiction was the subject of several notable academic studies in the early 1990s, as part of the [[cultural studies]] movement within the humanities: Most of these, as is characteristic of cultural studies, approach slash fiction from an ethnographic perspective and talk primarily about the writers of slash fiction and the communities that form around it. Slashers have been configured as fans who resisted culture.<ref name=Allington/> Some studies \u2013 for example by Italian anthropologist Mirna Ciconi \u2013 focus on textual analysis of slash fiction itself.\n\nSlash fiction was often ignored by [[queer theory|queer theorists]].<ref>{{cite journal\n |author1=Dhaenens F. |author2=Van Bauwel S. |author3=Biltereyst D. | year = 2008\n | title = Slashing the Fiction of Queer Theory\n | journal = Journal of Communication Inquiry\n | volume = 32\n | issue = 4\n | pages = 335\u2013347\n | doi = 10.1177/0196859908321508\n }}</ref> However, slash fiction has been described as important to the [[LGBT]] community and the formation of queer identities, as it represents a resistance to the expectation of compulsory heterosexuality,<ref>{{cite book |title=Science Fiction Curriculum, Cyborg Teachers, & Youth Culture(s) |last=Weaver |first=John A. |authorlink= |author2=Karen Anijar |author3=Toby Daspit  |page=84|year=2003 |publisher=P.

Young members of the community all go through a time in which they are still exploring their identity, labels, and pronouns. By writing slash fiction, queer youth can use their favorite characters and stories in order to create scenarios that allow them to explore their feelings, thoughts, and general self.

Legal scholars promoting copyright reform sometimes use slash fiction as an example of [[semiotic democracy]].<ref>See, e.g., Siva Vaidhyanathan, 'Critical Information Studies: A Bibliographic Manifesto' (2006) 20 ''Cultural Studies'' 292.</ref>\n\nThe term ''slash fiction'' has several noted ambiguities within it. Due to the lack of canonical homosexual relationships in source media at the time, some came to see slash fiction as being exclusively outside of canon. These people held that the term \"slash fiction\" only applies when the relationship being written about is ''not'' part of the source's canon, and that fan fiction about [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] same-sex relationships is hence not slash.<ref name=\"Tosenberger\">{{cite journal | last1 = Tosenberger | first1 = Catherine | year = 2008 | title = Homosexuality at the Online Hogwarts: Harry Potter Slash Fanfiction | url = | journal = Children's Literature | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 185\u2013207 | doi = 10.1353/chl.0.0017 }}</ref> The recent appearance of openly gay and bisexual characters on screen, such as [[Willow Rosenberg|Willow]] and [[Tara Maclay|Tara]] in the television series ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', the characters of ''[[Queer as Folk (UK TV series)|Queer as Folk]]'',<ref name=Tosenberger/> [[Jack Harkness]] in ''[[Doctor Who]]'', and numerous characters in ''[[Torchwood]]'', has added much to this discussion. Abiding by the aforementioned definition leaves such stories without a convenient label, so this distinction has not been widely adopted.<ref name=Tosenberger/>\n\nSome slash authors also write slash fiction which contains [[transgender]] themes and transgender/[[transsexual]] or [[intersex]] characters. As a result, the exact definition of the term has often been hotly debated within various slash fandoms. The strictest definition holds that only stories about relationships between two male partners ('M/M') are 'slash fiction', which has led to the evolution of the term [[femslash]]. Slash-like fiction is also written in various Japanese [[anime]] or [[manga]] fandoms, but is commonly referred to as [[sh\u014dnen-ai]] or [[yaoi]] for relationships between male characters, and [[sh\u014djo-ai]] or [[yuri (genre)|yuri]] between female characters respectively.\n\nDue to increasing popularity and prevalence of slash on the internet in recent years, some use ''slash'' as a generic term for any erotic fan fiction, whether it depicts heterosexual or homosexual relationships. This has caused concern for other slash writers who believe that while it can be erotic, slash is not by definition so, and that defining all erotic fic as slash takes the word away from all-ages-suitable homo-romantic fan fiction. In addition, a number of journalists writing about the fan fiction phenomenon in general seem to believe that ''all'' fan fiction is slash, or at least erotic in character.<ref>Dery, Mark. Glossary.

In addition to the legal issues associated with traditional fan fiction, some people believe that it tarnishes established media characters to portray them in a way which was never illustrated canonically.<ref>Hunter, Kendra. \"Characterization Rape.\" ''The Best of Trek 2''. New York: New American Library, 1977.</ref> But official disapproval of slash, specifically, is hard to find.

They find the online fandom, and comment about their activities including the writing of slash fanfiction. This is often referred to by fans of ''Supernatural'' as Wincest, based on the characters' surname (Winchester) and the fact that they are brothers (incest).\n\nThe revival of ''[[Doctor Who]]'' led by the openly gay writer [[Russell T Davies]] has also seen nods towards the slash fans beyond the omnisexual Captain Jack Harkness and other characters from the spin-off ''[[Torchwood]]''. Many fans see exchanges between the Doctor and the Master (played in the new series by [[John Simm]], whose ''[[Life on Mars (UK TV series)|Life On Mars]]'' character [[Sam Tyler]] is also the subject of a lot of slash fiction) as indicative of a previous relationship, or current attraction. At one point the Master says to the Doctor \"I like it when you use my name\", and in a [[Children in Need]] special, the tenth Doctor tells the fifth, after being asked whether the Master still has \"that rubbish beard\", \"no, no beard this time. Well, a wife. \" \u2013 which fans point to as a reference to gay men marrying a woman for public respectability, the wife being referred to as \"a beard\".

The term ''[[squick]]'' is most often used as a warning to refer to a reader's possible negative reaction to scenes in the text (often sexual) that some might find offensive or distressing, such as those including [[incest]], [[BDSM]], [[rape]], \"MPreg\" ([[male pregnancy]]), gender swapping, and [[torture]].

Another way to control heats is by becoming mates with an Alpha, which occurs when an Alpha bites the nape of the Omega's neck, but this leaves the Omega unable to mate with anyone else for life.\n\n==Other slash fanworks==\n\n===Slash art===\n\nIn addition to fiction, fans also create [[Visual arts|artwork]] depicting media characters in same-sex relationship contexts. Initially, slash art was mostly used in covers and interior pages of fanzines, and sold to other fans at media and slash conventions.\n\n=== Slash manips ===\nIn recent years, more slash artwork has used widespread availability of imaging software, like [[Adobe Photoshop]], to manipulate photographs of their subjects to produce romantic or erotic images (often referred to as ''slash manips''<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://journal.media-culture.org.au/index.php/mcjournal/article/view/677|title = Slash Manips: Remixing Popular Media with Gay Pornography|last = Brennan|first = Joseph|date = 2013|journal = M/C Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |volume = 16|issue = 4}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title = Not 'from my hot little ovaries': How slash manips pierce reductive assumptions|last = Brennan|first = Joseph|date = 2014|journal = Continuum: Journal of Media & Cultural Studies|doi = 10.1080/10304312.2013.854872|pmid = |issue = 2|volume = 28|pages = 247\u2013264}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brennan|first=Joseph|date=2016|title='If Duchamp's toilet can be a masterpiece\u2026': Slash manips as fannish readymades|url=|journal=Journal of Fandom Studies|volume=4|issue=1|pages=3\u201321|doi=10.1386/jfs.4.1.3_1|pmid=}}</ref>) which imply a homosexual relationship, either as static pictures or animated GIFs. When the manipulated photos depict real people instead of media characters, the creation of these images can be as contentious as RPS, and for many of the same reasons.\n\n===Slash vidding===\n[[Vidding]] has existed in media fandom since the 1980s, and slash vidding is still a popular movement within vidding.<ref>{{cite journal\n| last        = Coppa\n| first       = Francesca\n| year        = 2008\n| title       = Women, Star Trek, and the early development of fannish vidding\n| journal     = Transformative Works and Cultures\n| volume      = 1\n| issue       =\n| doi         = 10.3983/twc.2008.0044\n| doi-access= free\n}}</ref> Slash vidders take clips of characters (generally ones not written as gay, or in a relationship together), and through juxtaposition, song choice, and other techniques, portray a slash relationship on screen.<ref name=\"jenkins-howto\">{{cite web\n| first       = Henry\n| last        = Jenkins\n| title       = How to Watch a Fan-Vid\n| url         = http://www.henryjenkins.org/2006/09/how_to_watch_a_fanvid.html\n| publisher   = Confessions of an Aca-Fan: The Official Webblog of [[Henry Jenkins]]\n| date        = 18 September 2006\n| accessdate  = 15 August 2009\n}}</ref> Vidding used to be very guarded within the slash community, among other reasons, because the songs used in videos are copyrighted.

Retrieved on 17 October 2011.</ref> Many of these vids are made by slash (and gen) fans, but enormous numbers of them are made by people who have never heard of media fandom. The previous secrecy of vidding fans has come to seem unnecessary, but there is still a community ethos of not freely giving out a vidder's URL.\n\n===Slash roleplay===\nSometimes referred to as [[Yaoi]] (male/male) or [[Yuri (genre)|yuri]] (female/female), roleplay involving same-sex characters in relationships can be either with [[canon (fiction)|canon]] or original character creations. There are slash roleplaying based on ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]'', ''[[Supernatural]]'', ''[[Naruto]]'', ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' and ''[[Dragon Age]]'', among others.\n\nThere are many mediums used to approach the act of internet roleplaying including message boards, AIM, IRC and specially created chatrooms on servers. Some roleplay is very strict and requires players to be able to type a paragraph or two per each turn, some use strict guidelines involving roleplay dice and some are combinations of all of the above.\n\nNot every roleplay community accepts slash, however, and some people specifically disallow the use of it in their community as not being canon or simply the operators do not care for slash.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|LGBT|Human sexuality}}\n* [[Femslash]]\n* [[Erotic fantasy]]\n* [[Sex and sexuality in speculative fiction]]\n* [[Shipping (fandom)|Shipping]]\n* [[Yaoi]]\n* [[Yuri (genre)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Cicioni, Mirna (1998). \"Male Pair Bonds and Female Desire in Fan Slash Writing.\" In C.

''Star Trek'' remained an important slash fiction fandom, while new slash fandoms grew around other television shows, movies, and books with sci-fi or action adventure roots.\n\nEarly slash fans in England feared that they would be arrested, because slash violated the obscenity laws there at the time.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Falzone|first1=P.J.|title=The Final Frontier Is Queer: Aberrancy, Archetype and Audience Generated Folklore in K/S Slashfiction|journal=[[Western Folklore]]|date=2005|volume=64|issue=3/4|pages=243\u2013261|jstor=25474751}}</ref>\n\n===Slash sources===\nFrom its earliest days, slash fiction has been particularly inspired by popular [[speculative fiction]] franchises,<ref>[[David Seed]] Ed., ''A Companion to Science Fiction'', \"Science Fiction/Criticism\" p. 57, {{ISBN|1-4051-1218-2}}</ref><ref name=CHot20thcent798/> possibly because well-developed female characters may be lacking in speculative fiction, or because the speculative elements allow greater freedom to reinterpret canon characters. However, other large fandoms, such as ''Starsky and Hutch'' or ''The Professionals'', are based in non-speculative sources.\n\nSlash fiction follows popular media, and new stories are constantly produced. There is some correlation between the popularity and activity within each fandom and that of the source of the material. Slash fiction readers and writers tend to adhere closely to the canonical source of their fiction, and create a [[fandom]] for that particular source. However, some participants follow the slash content created by a certain [[fandom]] without being fans of the original source material itself.<ref>Green, Shoshanna, Cynthia Jenkings and Henry Jenkins. \"Normal Female Interest in Men Bonking: Selections From 'The Terra Nostra Underground' and 'Strange Bedfellows'.\" Ed.

With the advent of the internet, the slash fiction community of fans and writers created mailing lists (which gradually took the place of [[Amateur Press Association|APA]]s), and websites such as [[fanfiction.net]],<ref name=CHot20thcent798>{{cite book |title=The Cambridge history of twentieth-century English literature |last= Laura |first= Marcus|authorlink= |author2=Peter Nicholls |year=2004 |publisher= Cambridge University Press|page= 798|isbn=978-0-521-82077-6}}</ref> (which gradually started taking the place of zines).

As slash publishing gradually moved to the internet, the field became open to more writers, and a greater quantity of material was published.\n\nThe internet allowed slash authors more freedom: stories could include branching storylines, links, collages, songmixes, and other innovations. The internet increased slash visibility, and the number of readers, who were now able to access the stories from their own home at a much lower cost (the price of zines vs. the price of internet connections). The number of [[fandom]]s represented increased dramatically, especially those devoted to science fiction, fantasy, and police dramas.<ref name=\"Kustritz\" /> The internet also increased the level of interaction \u2013 making it easier for fans to comment on stories, give episode reviews, and [[meta|discuss]] and comment on trends in slash fandom itself. Websites and fanzines dedicated to fandoms such as ''[[The X-Files]]'', ''[[Stargate]]'', ''[[Harry Potter]]'', and ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' became common, with tens of thousands of slash stories available.<ref name=CHot20thcent798/>\n\n==Critical and queer attention==\n<!--discussing the academic theories on slash goes here - see yaoi or romance novel articles for examples of how this should look-->\nSlash fiction has received more academic attention than other genres of fan fiction.<ref name=CHot20thcent799/> Slash fiction was the subject of several notable academic studies in the early 1990s, as part of the [[cultural studies]] movement within the humanities: Most of these, as is characteristic of cultural studies, approach slash fiction from an ethnographic perspective and talk primarily about the writers of slash fiction and the communities that form around it. Slashers have been configured as fans who resisted culture.<ref name=Allington/> Some studies \u2013 for example by Italian anthropologist Mirna Ciconi \u2013 focus on textual analysis of slash fiction itself.\n\nSlash fiction was often ignored by [[queer theory|queer theorists]].<ref>{{cite journal\n |author1=Dhaenens F. |author2=Van Bauwel S. |author3=Biltereyst D. | year = 2008\n | title = Slashing the Fiction of Queer Theory\n | journal = Journal of Communication Inquiry\n | volume = 32\n | issue = 4\n | pages = 335\u2013347\n | doi = 10.1177/0196859908321508\n }}</ref> However, slash fiction has been described as important to the [[LGBT]] community and the formation of queer identities, as it represents a resistance to the expectation of compulsory heterosexuality,<ref>{{cite book |title=Science Fiction Curriculum, Cyborg Teachers, & Youth Culture(s) |last=Weaver |first=John A. |authorlink= |author2=Karen Anijar |author3=Toby Daspit  |page=84|year=2003 |publisher=P.

Young members of the community all go through a time in which they are still exploring their identity, labels, and pronouns. By writing slash fiction, queer youth can use their favorite characters and stories in order to create scenarios that allow them to explore their feelings, thoughts, and general self. Slash fiction, in that sense, offers queer youth the chance to explore who they are, and at a low risk.

''Encyclopedia of Erotic Literature'' New York: Routledge, pp. 1233\u20131235.</ref> Today, slash fiction is most commonly published on [[Tumblr]], [[LiveJournal]] accounts and other websites online, such as [[Organization for Transformative Works|Archive Of Our Own]]. Legal scholars promoting copyright reform sometimes use slash fiction as an example of [[semiotic democracy]].<ref>See, e.g., Siva Vaidhyanathan, 'Critical Information Studies: A Bibliographic Manifesto' (2006) 20 ''Cultural Studies'' 292.</ref>\n\nThe term ''slash fiction'' has several noted ambiguities within it. Due to the lack of canonical homosexual relationships in source media at the time, some came to see slash fiction as being exclusively outside of canon. These people held that the term \"slash fiction\" only applies when the relationship being written about is ''not'' part of the source's canon, and that fan fiction about [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] same-sex relationships is hence not slash.<ref name=\"Tosenberger\">{{cite journal | last1 = Tosenberger | first1 = Catherine | year = 2008 | title = Homosexuality at the Online Hogwarts: Harry Potter Slash Fanfiction | url = | journal = Children's Literature | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 185\u2013207 | doi = 10.1353/chl.0.0017 }}</ref> The recent appearance of openly gay and bisexual characters on screen, such as [[Willow Rosenberg|Willow]] and [[Tara Maclay|Tara]] in the television series ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', the characters of ''[[Queer as Folk (UK TV series)|Queer as Folk]]'',<ref name=Tosenberger/> [[Jack Harkness]] in ''[[Doctor Who]]'', and numerous characters in ''[[Torchwood]]'', has added much to this discussion. Abiding by the aforementioned definition leaves such stories without a convenient label, so this distinction has not been widely adopted.<ref name=Tosenberger/>\n\nSome slash authors also write slash fiction which contains [[transgender]] themes and transgender/[[transsexual]] or [[intersex]] characters. As a result, the exact definition of the term has often been hotly debated within various slash fandoms. The strictest definition holds that only stories about relationships between two male partners ('M/M') are 'slash fiction', which has led to the evolution of the term [[femslash]]. Slash-like fiction is also written in various Japanese [[anime]] or [[manga]] fandoms, but is commonly referred to as [[sh\u014dnen-ai]] or [[yaoi]] for relationships between male characters, and [[sh\u014djo-ai]] or [[yuri (genre)|yuri]] between female characters respectively.\n\nDue to increasing popularity and prevalence of slash on the internet in recent years, some use ''slash'' as a generic term for any erotic fan fiction, whether it depicts heterosexual or homosexual relationships. This has caused concern for other slash writers who believe that while it can be erotic, slash is not by definition so, and that defining all erotic fic as slash takes the word away from all-ages-suitable homo-romantic fan fiction. In addition, a number of journalists writing about the fan fiction phenomenon in general seem to believe that ''all'' fan fiction is slash, or at least erotic in character.<ref>Dery, Mark. Glossary.

In addition to the legal issues associated with traditional fan fiction, some people believe that it tarnishes established media characters to portray them in a way which was never illustrated canonically.<ref>Hunter, Kendra. \"Characterization Rape.\" ''The Best of Trek 2''. New York: New American Library, 1977.</ref> But official disapproval of slash, specifically, is hard to find.

They find the online fandom, and comment about their activities including the writing of slash fanfiction. This is often referred to by fans of ''Supernatural'' as Wincest, based on the characters' surname (Winchester) and the fact that they are brothers (incest).\n\nThe revival of ''[[Doctor Who]]'' led by the openly gay writer [[Russell T Davies]] has also seen nods towards the slash fans beyond the omnisexual Captain Jack Harkness and other characters from the spin-off ''[[Torchwood]]''. Many fans see exchanges between the Doctor and the Master (played in the new series by [[John Simm]], whose ''[[Life on Mars (UK TV series)|Life On Mars]]'' character [[Sam Tyler]] is also the subject of a lot of slash fiction) as indicative of a previous relationship, or current attraction. At one point the Master says to the Doctor \"I like it when you use my name\", and in a [[Children in Need]] special, the tenth Doctor tells the fifth, after being asked whether the Master still has \"that rubbish beard\", \"no, no beard this time. Well, a wife. \" \u2013 which fans point to as a reference to gay men marrying a woman for public respectability, the wife being referred to as \"a beard\".

Some sites require all stories to be rated and have warnings attached, often by using a [[beta reader]].\n\nThe term ''no lemon'' is sometimes used to indicate fan fiction stories without explicit sexual content. Anything with explicit content, especially with erotic scenes without accompanying romantic scenes, may be labeled \"lemon\". The term ''lemon'' arose from the [[anime]]/[[yaoi]] fandoms, referring to a [[hentai]] anime series, ''[[Cream Lemon]]''.  The term ''[[squick]]'' is most often used as a warning to refer to a reader's possible negative reaction to scenes in the text (often sexual) that some might find offensive or distressing, such as those including [[incest]], [[BDSM]], [[rape]], \"MPreg\" ([[male pregnancy]]), gender swapping, and [[torture]].

Another way to control heats is by becoming mates with an Alpha, which occurs when an Alpha bites the nape of the Omega's neck, but this leaves the Omega unable to mate with anyone else for life.\n\n==Other slash fanworks==\n\n===Slash art===\n\nIn addition to fiction, fans also create [[Visual arts|artwork]] depicting media characters in same-sex relationship contexts. Initially, slash art was mostly used in covers and interior pages of fanzines, and sold to other fans at media and slash conventions.\n\n=== Slash manips ===\nIn recent years, more slash artwork has used widespread availability of imaging software, like [[Adobe Photoshop]], to manipulate photographs of their subjects to produce romantic or erotic images (often referred to as ''slash manips''<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://journal.media-culture.org.au/index.php/mcjournal/article/view/677|title = Slash Manips: Remixing Popular Media with Gay Pornography|last = Brennan|first = Joseph|date = 2013|journal = M/C Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |volume = 16|issue = 4}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title = Not 'from my hot little ovaries': How slash manips pierce reductive assumptions|last = Brennan|first = Joseph|date = 2014|journal = Continuum: Journal of Media & Cultural Studies|doi = 10.1080/10304312.2013.854872|pmid = |issue = 2|volume = 28|pages = 247\u2013264}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brennan|first=Joseph|date=2016|title='If Duchamp's toilet can be a masterpiece\u2026': Slash manips as fannish readymades|url=|journal=Journal of Fandom Studies|volume=4|issue=1|pages=3\u201321|doi=10.1386/jfs.4.1.3_1|pmid=}}</ref>) which imply a homosexual relationship, either as static pictures or animated GIFs.

The previous secrecy of vidding fans has come to seem unnecessary, but there is still a community ethos of not freely giving out a vidder's URL.\n\n===Slash roleplay===\nSometimes referred to as [[Yaoi]] (male/male) or [[Yuri (genre)|yuri]] (female/female), roleplay involving same-sex characters in relationships can be either with [[canon (fiction)|canon]] or original character creations. There are slash roleplaying based on ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]'', ''[[Supernatural]]'', ''[[Naruto]]'', ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' and ''[[Dragon Age]]'', among others.\n\nThere are many mediums used to approach the act of internet roleplaying including message boards, AIM, IRC and specially created chatrooms on servers. Some roleplay is very strict and requires players to be able to type a paragraph or two per each turn, some use strict guidelines involving roleplay dice and some are combinations of all of the above.\n\nNot every roleplay community accepts slash, however, and some people specifically disallow the use of it in their community as not being canon or simply the operators do not care for slash.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|LGBT|Human sexuality}}\n* [[Femslash]]\n* [[Erotic fantasy]]\n* [[Sex and sexuality in speculative fiction]]\n* [[Shipping (fandom)|Shipping]]\n* [[Yaoi]]\n* [[Yuri (genre)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Cicioni, Mirna (1998). \"Male Pair Bonds and Female Desire in Fan Slash Writing.\" In C.

Open to anyone, regardless of gender or WWE employment status, the championship is defended \"[[24/7 service|24/7]]\", as in any time, [[Falls Count Anywhere match|anywhere]], as long as a WWE referee is present. Because of this rule, the championship is defended across all of WWE's brands: [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]], [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]], [[205 Live (WWE brand)|205 Live]], [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]], and [[NXT UK (WWE brand)|NXT UK]], as well as outside of regular WWE shows, often with videos posted on WWE's website and social media accounts. It is similar to the previous [[WWE Hardcore Championship]], which also had a \"[[WWE Hardcore Championship#24/7 rule|24/7 rule]]\".\n\nThe championship was introduced on the May 20, 2019, episode of ''[[Monday Night Raw]]'', during which [[Titus O'Neil]] from Raw became the inaugural champion by securing the title belt first in a scramble involving several other wrestlers. The current champion is [[Rob Gronkowski]], who is in his first reign. He won the title by pinning [[Mojo Rawley]] during [[WrestleMania 36]] Part 2, which [[Broadcast delay|aired]] on April 5, 2020; the event was taped on March 25 and March 26, but it is currently unknown which day this title change was taped.\n\nAs of {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}, there have been 96 recognized reigns between 36 different people. [[R-Truth]] has the most reigns at 35 and the longest combined reign at 165 days (152 days as recognized by WWE). [[Riddick Moss]]' reign is the longest singular reign at 41 days (40 days as recognized by WWE). Only eight other people have held the title for longer than a day: [[Carmella (wrestler)|Carmella]], [[Drake Maverick]], [[Elias (wrestler)|Elias]], [[Maria Kanellis]], [[Mojo Rawley]], [[Rob Gronkowski]], and both [[The Singh Brothers|Singh Brothers]], Samir and Sunil. WWE announcer Mike Rome has the shortest reign, which lasted approximately 9 seconds. [[WWE Hall of Fame]]r [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]] is the oldest champion, winning the title at 78 years old (also making him the oldest title holder in WWE history), while [[Enes Kanter]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) is the youngest, winning the title at 27. Former WWE wrestler [[Kelly Kelly]] was the first of six women to have won the title. WWE Hall of Famer [[Ted DiBiase|\"The Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase]] is the only title holder to become champion without winning the title; he purchased it from fellow Hall of Famer [[Alundra Blayze]], who was about to drop the belt into a trash can (reenacting the infamous incident of what she had done to the then-[[WWE Women's Championship (1956\u20132010)|WWF Women's Championship]] when she joined [[World Championship Wrestling]] in 1995).

Open to anyone, regardless of gender or WWE employment status, the championship is defended \"[[24/7 service|24/7]]\", as in any time, [[Falls Count Anywhere match|anywhere]], as long as a WWE referee is present. Because of this rule, the championship is defended across all of WWE's brands: [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]], [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]], [[205 Live (WWE brand)|205 Live]], [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]], and [[NXT UK (WWE brand)|NXT UK]], as well as outside of regular WWE shows, often with videos posted on WWE's website and social media accounts. It is similar to the previous [[WWE Hardcore Championship]], which also had a \"[[WWE Hardcore Championship#24/7 rule|24/7 rule]]\".\n\nThe championship was introduced on the May 20, 2019, episode of ''[[Monday Night Raw]]'', during which [[Titus O'Neil]] from Raw became the inaugural champion by securing the title belt first in a scramble involving several other wrestlers. The current champion is [[Rob Gronkowski]], who is in his first reign. He won the title by pinning [[Mojo Rawley]] during [[WrestleMania 36]] Part 2, which [[Broadcast delay|aired]] on April 5, 2020; the event was taped on March 25 and March 26, but it is currently unknown which day this title change was taped.\n\nAs of {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}, there have been 96 recognized reigns between 36 different people. [[R-Truth]] has the most reigns at 35 and the longest combined reign at 165 days (152 days as recognized by WWE). [[Riddick Moss]]' reign is the longest singular reign at 41 days (40 days as recognized by WWE). Only eight other people have held the title for longer than a day: [[Carmella (wrestler)|Carmella]], [[Drake Maverick]], [[Elias (wrestler)|Elias]], [[Maria Kanellis]], [[Mojo Rawley]], [[Rob Gronkowski]], and both [[The Singh Brothers|Singh Brothers]], Samir and Sunil. WWE announcer Mike Rome has the shortest reign, which lasted approximately 9 seconds. [[WWE Hall of Fame]]r [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]] is the oldest champion, winning the title at 78 years old (also making him the oldest title holder in WWE history), while [[Enes Kanter]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) is the youngest, winning the title at 27. Former WWE wrestler [[Kelly Kelly]] was the first of six women to have won the title. WWE Hall of Famer [[Ted DiBiase|\"The Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase]] is the only title holder to become champion without winning the title; he purchased it from fellow Hall of Famer [[Alundra Blayze]], who was about to drop the belt into a trash can (reenacting the infamous incident of what she had done to the then-[[WWE Women's Championship (1956\u20132010)|WWF Women's Championship]] when she joined [[World Championship Wrestling]] in 1995). [[The Revival (professional wrestling)|The Revival]] ([[Scott Dawson (wrestler)|Scott Dawson]] and [[Dash Wilder]]) are the only tag team to win the title, being recognized as co-champions.<ref name=\"OfficialTitleHistory\"/>\n\nNon-wrestlers to have held the title include [[Fox Sports|Fox]] sportscaster [[Rob Stone (sportscaster)|Rob Stone]], NBA player Enes Kanter, [[electronic music]] producer/[[disc jockey]] [[Marshmello]], WWE Senior Account Manager Michael Giaccio, [[NASCAR]] driver [[Kyle Busch]], and ''Raw'' announcer Mike Rome.<ref name=OfficialTitleHistory>{{cite web |url=https://www.wwe.com/classics/titlehistory/24-7-championship|title=24/7 Championship|publisher=WWE|accessdate=June 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Title history==\n''Note: Unless otherwise noted, the fall took place in the ring.''\nAs of {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}.\n{{Professional wrestling title history top|active=yes|days=yes|days2=yes|dayless=yes}}\n{{PWtitlereign\n|number   = 1\n|champion = {{sortname|Titus|O'Neil}}\n|reign    = 1\n|date     = {{dts|May 20, 2019}}\n|days     = <1\n|days2    = yes\n|location = [[Albany, NY]]\n|event    = ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]''\n|notes    = After the establishment of the championship, [[Mick Foley]] laid the belt in the ring.
