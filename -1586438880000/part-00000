The cut-down was created to modernize the appearance and improve the performance of the aging J-series Harley-Davidson.  By removing the front fender, shortening the rear, and removing all excess accessories, the motorcycle was significantly lightened.  The cut-down was also characterized by a modified frame, in which the seat tube was lowered and the wheelbase shortened, resulting in a lower, shorter machine, with a sweeping diagonal line between the steering head and rear axle.\n\nIn 1933 the [[American Motorcyclist Association|AMA]] introduced Class C racing, which stipulated only catalogued racing motorcycles could be used in sanctioned competition, with points gained towards the National Championship.

The first bob-jobs appeared in the mid-1930s, and tended to reflect their somber competition origins, with plain paint jobs and no extra chrome or decoration.\n\nImmediately after [[World War II]], bob-jobs, in parallel with [[hot rod]]s, were subject to increasingly decorative modifications, including extra [[chrome plating]], [[Metallic paint|metal flake paint]] jobs, [[pin striping]], and colored [[upholstery]].  As early as 1946, Kenneth Howard ('[[Von Dutch]]') began modifying his Indian Scout bob-job with wild paint jobs, a smaller gas tank, raised handlebars, and exhaust pipes which turned upwards at the rear.<ref>'The Art of Von Dutch', Kahan, Nason, Quatrocchi, Smith, 2006, Tornado Design, Los Angeles, {{ISBN|0-9771118-1-4}}</ref>  Such modifications became the standard for bob-jobs, which grew in popularity, whether as show bikes <ref>'Hop Up', Morton, 2002, MBI, St. Paul, {{ISBN|0-7603-1073-4}}</ref> or ordinary road bikes.  The bob-job evolved through the 1950s and 60s in several directions; some were strictly for the popular motorcycle and hot rod show circuit, some had a distinctive  'club bike' style, some reflected drag racing practice, and some were simply a continuation of the original Class C inspiration.\n\nBob-jobs reflected the aesthetic tastes of their owners, and were home-built, there being no commercially produced road-going bob-job available until the late 1990s.<ref>{{cite book | last = Miguel | first = Jose de | title = How to Build a Bobber on a Budget | publisher = Motorbooks | location = Minneapolis | year = 2008 | edition=1st | isbn = 9780760327852 }}</ref> The style has also influenced motorcycle manufacturers, such as [[Harley-Davidson]]<ref>{{cite book | last = Holmstrom | first = Darwin | title = Harley-Davidson Century | publisher = Motorbooks | location = Minneapolis | year = 2002 | edition=1st | isbn = 9780760311554 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Ets-Hokin|first1=Gabe |title=2008 1/2 Harley Softail Cross Bones, Buell Ulysses XB12XT - First Look |url=http://www.cycleworld.com/2008/01/23/2008-12-harley-softail-cross-bones-buell-ulysses-xb12xt-first-look/ |website=Cycle World |publisher=Bonnier Corp. |accessdate=1 January 2015 |date=23 January 2008 |quote=The new bike, styled like a classic post-World War II bobber, has apehangers, a springer front end, a cut-down rear fender, a tractor saddle and tough, aggressive styling.

Springer forks are popular on both bikes, but often mounted with a higher rake in the Chopper\u00b4s triple-tree, to move the front wheel forward.

The bob-job evolved through the 1950s and 60s in several directions; some were strictly for the popular motorcycle and hot rod show circuit, some had a distinctive  'club bike' style, some reflected drag racing practice, and some were simply a continuation of the original Class C inspiration.\n\nBob-jobs reflected the aesthetic tastes of their owners, and were home-built, there being no commercially produced road-going bob-job available until the late 1990s.<ref>{{cite book | last = Miguel | first = Jose de | title = How to Build a Bobber on a Budget | publisher = Motorbooks | location = Minneapolis | year = 2008 | edition=1st | isbn = 9780760327852 }}</ref> The style has also influenced motorcycle manufacturers, such as [[Harley-Davidson]]<ref>{{cite book | last = Holmstrom | first = Darwin | title = Harley-Davidson Century | publisher = Motorbooks | location = Minneapolis | year = 2002 | edition=1st | isbn = 9780760311554 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Ets-Hokin|first1=Gabe |title=2008 1/2 Harley Softail Cross Bones, Buell Ulysses XB12XT - First Look |url=http://www.cycleworld.com/2008/01/23/2008-12-harley-softail-cross-bones-buell-ulysses-xb12xt-first-look/ |website=Cycle World |publisher=Bonnier Corp. |accessdate=1 January 2015 |date=23 January 2008 |quote=The new bike, styled like a classic post-World War II bobber, has apehangers, a springer front end, a cut-down rear fender, a tractor saddle and tough, aggressive styling.

The bobber continues to be favored today; although hybrid styles have emerged, such as the \"bobber chopper\", and \"retro-bobber\".<ref name=\"Seate\">{{cite book | last = Seate | first = Mike | title = Outlaw choppers | publisher = Motorbooks | location = Minneapolis | year = 2004 | edition=1st | isbn = 9780760318492 }}</ref> Such bobbers exemplify the continuing evolution of the style, and its enduring popularity.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Roland |title=Sport Bobber: Yamaha XV950 |url=http://bikeindia.in/sport-bobber-yamaha-xv950/ |accessdate=1 January 2015 |work=Bike India |publisher=Next Gen Publishing Ltd |date=15 April 2014 |quote=Essentially, the XV is a production bobber: a simple, relatively sporty cruiser, designed to be easily customised using a variety of factory-made accessories.}}</ref>\n\n==Bobbers vs. choppers==\nThe term '[[Chopper (motorcycle)|chopper]]' did not appear in print until the mid-1960s, over 30 years after the bob-job was invented.  The chopper is a more stylistically and technically extreme evolution of the bob-job, which emerged after the highly elaborate, heavily chromed bob-jobs which appeared in the late 1940s and 1950s.  Bobbers are typically built around unmodified frames, while choppers use either highly modified or custom-made frames.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lane | first = Billy | title = Billy Lane's How to Build Old School Choppers, Bobbers and Customs |publisher = Motorbooks | location = Minneapolis | year = 2005 | edition=1st | isbn = 9780760321683 }}</ref> Chopper frames are often cut and welded into shape.  Thus, bobbers are fairly easy to create from stock motorcycles and are generally hand built.\n\nWhile customized motorcycles can be expensive, bobber builders tend to adopt an economical approach involving old, second-hand, recycled parts and hand-machined items reminiscent of the period before the mass-market motorcycle accessory industry had developed.<ref name=\"Seate\" /><ref>{{cite book | last = Baas | first = Kevin | title = How to Build an Old Skool [sic] Bobber | publisher = Wolfgang Pub | location = Stillwater, MN | year = 2011 | isbn = 9781935828006 }}</ref>\n\nInstead of the large diameter front wheels of Choppers<ref>https://www.thunderbike.com/model/chopper-en/</ref>, Bobbers<ref>https://www.thunderbike.com/model/bobber-en/</ref> usually come with a size similar to the rear rim. Builders mostly use spring saddles, which isn\u00b4t a must on choppers with their long extended sissy-bars. Springer forks are popular on both bikes, but often mounted with a higher rake in the Chopper\u00b4s triple-tree, to move the front wheel forward. Instead of glossy flake-paintings and chrome parts used for many Choppers, a Bobber more often comes as a [[Ratbike]] in flat paint and/or some rusty parts.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bobber (disambiguation)|Bobber]]\n* [[Triumph Bonneville Bobber]]\n* [[Cutdown]]\n* [[Caf\u00e9 racer]]\n* [[Streetfighter]]\n* [[Outline of motorcycles and motorcycling]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Types of motorcycles}}\n\n[[Category:Custom motorcycles]]\n[[Category:Motorcycle customization]]\n", "name_user": "82.38.235.195", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Fixed description)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobber_(motorcycle)"}

He is voiced by [[Ray Liotta]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://au.ign.com/articles/2012/07/03/ign-presents-the-history-of-grand-theft-auto-2?page=3 |title=IGN Presents The History of Grand Theft Auto |last1=McLaughlin |first1=Rus |last2=Thomas |first2=Lucas M. |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=July 3, 2012 |accessdate=April 17, 2013 }}</ref> Tommy is the first [[Player character|playable]] protagonist in the ''Grand Theft Auto'' series that has a proper voice actor, with full dialogue.\n\nTommy is an [[gangster|ex-gangster]] or [[made man|ex-made man]] for the Forelli family, a fictional [[Italian-American Mafia|Italian Mafia]] [[Crime family|family]] in the Grand Theft Auto universe. After being released from prison, Tommy agrees to take part in a deal for an old friend, in which he was ambushed. In an attempt to find the man who set up the ambush, Tommy rises through the ranks of the Vice City crime underworld. After murdering the man who set up the ambush, he becomes extremely powerful in the criminal world, and eventually becomes the [[Boss (crime)|kingpin]] of Vice City.\n\n==Character design==\n[[File:Tommy Vercetti concept art.png|110px|thumb|left|A piece of concept art featuring Tommy, sporting a similar hairstyle to that of his in-game appearance.]]\n\nTommy, an [[Italian-American]], is portrayed with a tall, swarthy, handsome appearance, combed dark brown, almost black hair, and a constant five o'clock shadow. He first appears wearing a light blue-green Hawaiian shirt with dark blue palm trees printed on it, a gold pearl necklace around his neck, a gold watch around his left wrist, and a pair of blue jeans and white sneakers. This outfit becomes known as Tommy's \"street\" clothes. As the game progresses, Tommy is offered more wardrobe options: he obtains a blue-purple pastel suit with the sleeves rolled up over a black dress shirt and black loafers, as well as the option of a dark pinstripe suit labeled as \"Mr. Vercetti\" (which bears similarities to [[Tony Montana]]'s uniform). A light green costume is available to perform a bank robbery, complete with a hockey mask, and is even able to wear the uniform for an allied gang, among many others.\n\nTommy Vercetti, in several ways, exhibits characteristics of fictional drug lord [[Tony Montana]] from the 1983 film ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]''. This coincides with the heavy themes and appearance of the movie that has been implemented into ''Vice City''. Among these characteristics, his [[exile]] from his old home ([[Liberty City (Grand Theft Auto)|Liberty City]]), his rise to power (acquiring property and wealth in the city, and a mansion which also sports an interior similar to that of Montana's mansion). Tommy is also a hired assassin, has killed his own collaborators (Lance Vance), taken over his temporary boss's business (Ricardo Diaz) and rebelled against his former leader (Sonny Forelli), as Tony Montana had. The only notable difference is that the final gunfight in Montana's mansion sees Montana eventually killed, whereas the final gunfight in Tommy's mansion sees Tommy managing to single-handedly take down his captors and survive.<ref>{{cite web | title=Examining Grand Theft Auto's Scarface Connection | url=http://www.gamechronicles.com/features/gtascarface/gtascarface.htm |publisher=Game Chronicles |last=O'Neill |first=Cliff | accessdate=March 29, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===Characteristics===\nTommy Vercetti is depicted as both intelligent and temperamental; he is easily angered and quick to resort to violence. He has no hesitation about killing, though many of his victims are in turn trying to kill Tommy as well, or have done something that requires them to be killed. Despite all this, Tommy does also show a softer side as seen with his relations with Mercedes Cortez and Earnest Kelly, the latter whom he views as a father figure due to his childhood memories of working with his father at a printworks.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nTommy Vercetti was born to an [[Italian-American]] family and was raised in Liberty City, where his father worked for an unknown company (presumably the Liberty Tree) working on its printers. It is unknown whether he owned the printing company or not but Tommy used to clean its rollers and suggests he lived a normal and moral life.<ref name=\"Print rollers\">{{cite video game | title = [[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City]] | developer = [[Rockstar North]] | publisher = [[Rockstar Games]] | date = October 29, 2002 | platform = [[PlayStation 2]] | quote = Mission: \"Spilling the Beans\"<br/> '''[[Earnest Kelly]]:''' \"Mr. Vercetti?

I was going to follow him in his trade, but... I lived a different life.\"}}</ref> When he was a teenager, he would befriend Mafia mobster Sonny Forelli, whom was a rising force in the Forelli Crime Family (it is unknown whether or not he was already Don, but can be assumed as police information say Sonny became Boss of the Mafia at an early age) and would start working for the Forelli Family, earning the syndicates' trust to eventually become a Made-Man in the Mafia.<ref name=\"badasses\">{{cite web |url=http://au.ign.com/articles/2008/04/28/grand-theft-auto-favorite-badasses?page=3 |title=Grand Theft Auto: Favorite Badasses |last=Scheeden |first=Jesse |date=April 28, 2008 |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=April 20, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1971, jealous and nervous of Tommy's rising reputation inside the Mafia and the Liberty City crime scene, Sonny sent Tommy to kill a key mobster (presumably of the Leone Family) in the Harwood District for unknown reasons (presumably because of the Mafia's scuffles over rackets and revenge). In actuality, what was supposed to be Tommy's clean hit would turn out to be a threat set up by Sonny. When Tommy arrived, eleven men would ambush him due to Sonny having probably warned Tommy's enemies of the impending threat posed by him (or even having organized the ambush himself). Tommy would miraculously survive after killing all eleven of them, but would end up being arrested in the process and sent to prison for multiple charges of murder.<ref name=\"Final confrontation\">{{cite video game | title = [[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City]] | developer = [[Rockstar North]] | publisher = [[Rockstar Games]] | date = October 29, 2002 | platform = [[PlayStation 2]] | quote = Mission: \"Keep Your Friends Close...\"<br/>'''Sonny Forelli:''' \"Didn't I say your temper would get you into trouble, huh?...How many was it?

He also earned the title \"The Harwood Butcher\" for how he singlehandedly slew eleven men on his own.<ref name=\"badasses\"/>\n\n===Release from prison===\nFresh out of prison in 1986, Tommy is immediately dispatched by then Don Sonny Forelli to Vice City in order to participate in a drug deal. This deal was organized due to Sonny's fear that Tommy's presence in Liberty City would cause problems for his organization (whom by this time was the most powerful Mafia Family in Liberty City) as Tommy's Harwood Slaughter of 1971 was still fresh in the minds of police and would thus cause the law enforcers in Liberty City to start possibly harassing the Forelli Family. Sonny orders Tommy to expand into the drug business in the south and to stay there for a while finding opportunities for a good business.\n\nTommy arrives at the deal as a supervisor between the Forelli Crime Family and the Vance Crime Family. Just then, a group of masked assailants open fire on them, killing [[Victor Vance]] and Forelli's men (Harry and Lee), resulting in Tommy losing both the money and the drugs, from which he narrowly escapes with Ken Rosenberg, a lawyer and Forelli's Vice City contact. With the promise to Sonny to retrieve both the drugs and money, he then sets out to find and kill the party responsible. Tommy, while associated with Lance Vance, Victor's brother, begins to work for Vice City's most powerful drug baron Ricardo Diaz (who is later revealed to be responsible for the ambushed deal).\n\n===Business ventures===\nAfter Tommy and Lance lead an assault on Diaz's estate and kill him, Tommy begins to disobey Sonny's orders and enjoys the empire he claimed from Diaz, without paying any tribute to the Forelli family, enraging Sonny, who constantly demands a larger cut of the profits from Tommy, and Lance, who wants more respect from Tommy and also more control in the family. He and the Forelli Family's conflict reach a boiling point when Tommy kills Forelli henchmen sent to seize his business revenue, and Sonny personally visits him in Vice City. Due to Lance's betrayal, he is forced into a large shootout with the Forelli crew, in which he kills Sonny, Lance, and the hit squad, finally securing his empire and gang in the city, with Ken Rosenberg as his main partner. It is also during this major gunfight that Tommy discovers that Sonny actually set up the eleven people to ambush Tommy and caused him to spend fifteen years in prison.<ref>{{cite video game | title = [[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City]] | developer = [[Rockstar North]] | publisher = [[Rockstar Games]] | date = October 29, 2002 | platform = [[PlayStation 2]] | quote = Mission: \"Keep Your Friends Close...\"<br/>'''Tommy:''' You took fifteen years from me, Sonny, and now I'm gonna make you pay!<br/>'''Sonny:''' You still don't get it, do you? I OWN you, Tommy. Those fifteen years were mine to spend!}}</ref>\n\nAt the end of the game, Tommy is shown to have become an extremely powerful figure in Vice City's criminal underworld. He has established the Vercetti Family, and he is shown to own a huge mansion, many businesses as fronts, and also has a dominating role in established drug trades in Vice City. He also leads the most powerful family in Vice City, still retaining his well-known nickname, and his defeat of the Forelli family leader is the beginning of the Forelli decline in  Liberty City. Also, with the cooperation from the Big Mitch Baker's Bikers and the Los Cabrones, they are shown to be Vercetti's mutual business partners. Tommy, at the end of the game, is the [[Boss (crime)|kingpin]] of Vice City.\n\n==Influences and analysis==\n[[File:Ray Liotta Deauville 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ray Liotta]], the actor who provided the voice for Tommy Vercetti, at the [[2014 Deauville American Film Festival]]]]\n\nPrior to the release of ''Vice City'', [[IGN]] stated that Tommy was likely to \"leave the same kind of imprint on kids today that [actor Ray Liotta's] portrayal of Ray Sinclair left on every high school and college kid who saw ''[[Something Wild (1986 film)|Something Wild]]'' back in 1986.\" They also compared Liotta's portrayal of Tommy to his portrayal of [[Henry Hill]] in ''[[Goodfellas]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://au.ign.com/articles/2002/10/25/the-voice-of-vice-city |title=The Voice of Vice City |author=IGN Staff |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=25 October 2002 |accessdate=16 April 2014 }}</ref>\n\nWhen asked about his portrayal of Tommy, Liotta stated that \"it was hard work.\" He said that \"you're pretty much putting yourself in [the game developers'] hands and doing whatever they want so there's not much for you to do creatively.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.ca/news/article.jhtml?id=23742 |title=Ray Liotta recalls his Grand Theft Auto days as Tommy Vercetti |last=McAnulty |first=Nick |publisher=[[MTV (Canada)#MTV.ca|MTV.ca]] |date=12 January 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218073646/http://www.mtv.ca/news/article.jhtml?id=23742 |archivedate=18 December 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe character of Tommy Vercetti received very positive reviews and remarks from critics and players of ''Vice City'', making it to many lists of the best video game characters.

After being released from prison, Tommy agrees to take part in a deal for an old friend, in which he was ambushed. In an attempt to find the man who set up the ambush, Tommy rises through the ranks of the Vice City crime underworld. After murdering the man who set up the ambush, he becomes extremely powerful in the criminal world, and eventually becomes the [[Boss (crime)|kingpin]] of Vice City.\n\n==Character design==\n[[File:Tommy Vercetti concept art.png|110px|thumb|left|A piece of concept art featuring Tommy, sporting a similar hairstyle to that of his in-game appearance.]]\n\nTommy, an [[Italian-American]], is portrayed with a tall, swarthy, handsome appearance, combed dark brown, almost black hair, and a constant five o'clock shadow. He first appears wearing a light blue-green Hawaiian shirt with dark blue palm trees printed on it, a gold pearl necklace around his neck, a gold watch around his left wrist, and a pair of blue jeans and white sneakers. This outfit becomes known as Tommy's \"street\" clothes. As the game progresses, Tommy is offered more wardrobe options: he obtains a blue-purple pastel suit with the sleeves rolled up over a black dress shirt and black loafers, as well as the option of a dark pinstripe suit labeled as \"Mr. Vercetti\" (which bears similarities to [[Tony Montana]]'s uniform). A light green costume is available to perform a bank robbery, complete with a hockey mask, and is even able to wear the uniform for an allied gang, among many others.\n\nTommy Vercetti, in several ways, exhibits characteristics of fictional drug lord [[Tony Montana]] from the 1983 film ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]''. This coincides with the heavy themes and appearance of the movie that has been implemented into ''Vice City''. Among these characteristics, his [[exile]] from his old home ([[Liberty City (Grand Theft Auto)|Liberty City]]), his rise to power (acquiring property and wealth in the city, and a mansion which also sports an interior similar to that of Montana's mansion). Tommy is also a hired assassin, has killed his own collaborators (Lance Vance), taken over his temporary boss's business (Ricardo Diaz) and rebelled against his former leader (Sonny Forelli), as Tony Montana had. The only notable difference is that the final gunfight in Montana's mansion sees Montana eventually killed, whereas the final gunfight in Tommy's mansion sees Tommy managing to single-handedly take down his captors and survive.<ref>{{cite web | title=Examining Grand Theft Auto's Scarface Connection | url=http://www.gamechronicles.com/features/gtascarface/gtascarface.htm |publisher=Game Chronicles |last=O'Neill |first=Cliff | accessdate=March 29, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===Characteristics===\nTommy Vercetti is depicted as both intelligent and temperamental; he is easily angered and quick to resort to violence. He has no hesitation about killing, though many of his victims are in turn trying to kill Tommy as well, or have done something that requires them to be killed. Despite all this, Tommy does also show a softer side as seen with his relations with Mercedes Cortez and Earnest Kelly, the latter whom he views as a father figure due to his childhood memories of working with his father at a printworks.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nTommy Vercetti was born to an [[Italian-American]] family and was raised in Liberty City, where his father worked for an unknown company (presumably the Liberty Tree) working on its printers. It is unknown whether he owned the printing company or not but Tommy used to clean its rollers and suggests he lived a normal and moral life.<ref name=\"Print rollers\">{{cite video game | title = [[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City]] | developer = [[Rockstar North]] | publisher = [[Rockstar Games]] | date = October 29, 2002 | platform = [[PlayStation 2]] | quote = Mission: \"Spilling the Beans\"<br/> '''[[Earnest Kelly]]:''' \"Mr. Vercetti?

I was going to follow him in his trade, but... I lived a different life.\"}}</ref> When he was a teenager, he would befriend Mafia mobster Sonny Forelli, whom was a rising force in the Forelli Crime Family (it is unknown whether or not he was already Don, but can be assumed as police information say Sonny became Boss of the Mafia at an early age) and would start working for the Forelli Family, earning the syndicates' trust to eventually become a Made-Man in the Mafia.<ref name=\"badasses\">{{cite web |url=http://au.ign.com/articles/2008/04/28/grand-theft-auto-favorite-badasses?page=3 |title=Grand Theft Auto: Favorite Badasses |last=Scheeden |first=Jesse |date=April 28, 2008 |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=April 20, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1971, jealous and nervous of Tommy's rising reputation inside the Mafia and the Liberty City crime scene, Sonny sent Tommy to kill a key mobster (presumably of the Leone Family) in the Harwood District for unknown reasons (presumably because of the Mafia's scuffles over rackets and revenge). In actuality, what was supposed to be Tommy's clean hit would turn out to be a threat set up by Sonny. When Tommy arrived, eleven men would ambush him due to Sonny having probably warned Tommy's enemies of the impending threat posed by him (or even having organized the ambush himself). Tommy would miraculously survive after killing all eleven of them, but would end up being arrested in the process and sent to prison for multiple charges of murder.<ref name=\"Final confrontation\">{{cite video game | title = [[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City]] | developer = [[Rockstar North]] | publisher = [[Rockstar Games]] | date = October 29, 2002 | platform = [[PlayStation 2]] | quote = Mission: \"Keep Your Friends Close...\"<br/>'''Sonny Forelli:''' \"Didn't I say your temper would get you into trouble, huh?...How many was it?

He also earned the title \"The Harwood Butcher\" for how he singlehandedly slew eleven men on his own.<ref name=\"badasses\"/>\n\n===Release from prison===\nFresh out of prison in 1986, Tommy is immediately dispatched by then Don Sonny Forelli to Vice City in order to participate in a drug deal. This deal was organized due to Sonny's fear that Tommy's presence in Liberty City would cause problems for his organization (whom by this time was the most powerful Mafia Family in Liberty City) as Tommy's Harwood Slaughter of 1971 was still fresh in the minds of police and would thus cause the law enforcers in Liberty City to start possibly harassing the Forelli Family. Sonny orders Tommy to expand into the drug business in the south and to stay there for a while finding opportunities for a good business.\n\nTommy arrives at the deal as a supervisor between the Forelli Crime Family and the Vance Crime Family. Just then, a group of masked assailants open fire on them, killing [[Victor Vance]] and Forelli's men (Harry and Lee), resulting in Tommy losing both the money and the drugs, from which he narrowly escapes with Ken Rosenberg, a lawyer and Forelli's Vice City contact. With the promise to Sonny to retrieve both the drugs and money, he then sets out to find and kill the party responsible. Tommy, while associated with Lance Vance, Victor's brother, begins to work for Vice City's most powerful drug baron Ricardo Diaz (who is later revealed to be responsible for the ambushed deal).\n\n===Business ventures===\nAfter Tommy and Lance lead an assault on Diaz's estate and kill him, Tommy begins to disobey Sonny's orders and enjoys the empire he claimed from Diaz, without paying any tribute to the Forelli family, enraging Sonny, who constantly demands a larger cut of the profits from Tommy, and Lance, who wants more respect from Tommy and also more control in the family. He and the Forelli Family's conflict reach a boiling point when Tommy kills Forelli henchmen sent to seize his business revenue, and Sonny personally visits him in Vice City. Due to Lance's betrayal, he is forced into a large shootout with the Forelli crew, in which he kills Sonny, Lance, and the hit squad, finally securing his empire and gang in the city, with Ken Rosenberg as his main partner. It is also during this major gunfight that Tommy discovers that Sonny actually set up the eleven people to ambush Tommy and caused him to spend fifteen years in prison.<ref>{{cite video game | title = [[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City]] | developer = [[Rockstar North]] | publisher = [[Rockstar Games]] | date = October 29, 2002 | platform = [[PlayStation 2]] | quote = Mission: \"Keep Your Friends Close...\"<br/>'''Tommy:''' You took fifteen years from me, Sonny, and now I'm gonna make you pay!<br/>'''Sonny:''' You still don't get it, do you? I OWN you, Tommy. Those fifteen years were mine to spend!}}</ref>\n\nAt the end of the game, Tommy is shown to have become an extremely powerful figure in Vice City's criminal underworld. He has established the Vercetti Family, and he is shown to own a huge mansion, many businesses as fronts, and also has a dominating role in established drug trades in Vice City. He also leads the most powerful family in Vice City, still retaining his well-known nickname, and his defeat of the Forelli family leader is the beginning of the Forelli decline in  Liberty City. Also, with the cooperation from the Big Mitch Baker's Bikers and the Los Cabrones, they are shown to be Vercetti's mutual business partners. Tommy, at the end of the game, is the [[Boss (crime)|kingpin]] of Vice City.\n\n==Influences and analysis==\n[[File:Ray Liotta Deauville 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ray Liotta]], the actor who provided the voice for Tommy Vercetti, at the [[2014 Deauville American Film Festival]]]]\n\nPrior to the release of ''Vice City'', [[IGN]] stated that Tommy was likely to \"leave the same kind of imprint on kids today that [actor Ray Liotta's] portrayal of Ray Sinclair left on every high school and college kid who saw ''[[Something Wild (1986 film)|Something Wild]]'' back in 1986.\" They also compared Liotta's portrayal of Tommy to his portrayal of [[Henry Hill]] in ''[[Goodfellas]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://au.ign.com/articles/2002/10/25/the-voice-of-vice-city |title=The Voice of Vice City |author=IGN Staff |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=25 October 2002 |accessdate=16 April 2014 }}</ref>\n\nWhen asked about his portrayal of Tommy, Liotta stated that \"it was hard work.\" He said that \"you're pretty much putting yourself in [the game developers'] hands and doing whatever they want so there's not much for you to do creatively.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.ca/news/article.jhtml?id=23742 |title=Ray Liotta recalls his Grand Theft Auto days as Tommy Vercetti |last=McAnulty |first=Nick |publisher=[[MTV (Canada)#MTV.ca|MTV.ca]] |date=12 January 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218073646/http://www.mtv.ca/news/article.jhtml?id=23742 |archivedate=18 December 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe character of Tommy Vercetti received very positive reviews and remarks from critics and players of ''Vice City'', making it to many lists of the best video game characters.

The improvements included widening the road and adding parking along the street. North Main Street was re-opened on October 2, 2008.\n\nStarting in mid 2006, Century Park went under construction to rebuild the lake that had been drained years before due to a structural issues with its dam. The lake was restocked with fish and renovated, and the park is now accessible from Century Blvd with bathrooms and picnic areas. The project was finished in the Spring 2008. Beginning in May 2009 the public is allowed to fish from the lake.\n\nAlso, Century Blvd went under construction in the winter of 2008. The construction extended Century Place Blvd which allowed traffic from South Main St to Century Blvd. The construction was finished in January 2009.\n\nThe resident houses in the historical district on Salisbury St. were given an ordinance to renovate their homes to match the current renovations done to the roads leading into downtown along with the new bank and park added further downtown.

The new bridge includes stone side walls, sidewalks, and light posts.\n\nIn 2012, new landscaping was put into place around the Main Street exit and entrance ramps from B-40 business.\n\nBeginning in 2012, construction began to replace the Hastings Hill Road overpass bridge to B-40 business. The project is focused around replacing the outdated bridge as well as making the northern part of the road leading to the bridge a straight shot over B-40 business instead of the winding road it currently is. The project may include additional benefits such as exit/entrance ramps to B-40 business. Such access would eliminate the large distance between the closest exits (S. Main St. and Linville Rd.) and provide easier access for motorists to surrounding areas of the overpass.\n\nBeginning in Fall 2013, road construction began to incorporate a traffic circle to the intersection of W. Bodenhamer St. and Dobson St. The project is focused around decreasing the traffic congestion of the intersection around heavy traffic times. The project is estimated to complete in mid-2014.\n\nBeginning in Fall 2013, construction began on the Macy Grove Road overpass bridge to B-40 business. The project has so far been focused around replacing the old bridge but may include additional benefits such as exit/entrance ramps to B-40 business. Such access would provide much easier access for motorists to the Novant Health Kernersville Medical Center, the areas biggest hospital.\n\nThe intersection of Wallburg Road and Union Cross Road near Union Cross Park had been constructed to where motorists can simply head onto eastbound Union Cross Road and Wallburg Road which also featured installment of traffic lights.\n\n==Education==\n[[Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Schools]] serves the community.\n\nKernersville is served by five public elementary schools, three public middle schools, and two public high schools \u2013 [[Robert B.

The improvements included widening the road and adding parking along the street. North Main Street was re-opened on October 2, 2008.\n\nStarting in mid 2006, Century Park went under construction to rebuild the lake that had been drained years before due to a structural issues with its dam. The lake was restocked with fish and renovated, and the park is now accessible from Century Blvd with bathrooms and picnic areas. The project was finished in the Spring 2008. Beginning in May 2009 the public is allowed to fish from the lake.\n\nAlso, Century Blvd went under construction in the winter of 2008. The construction extended Century Place Blvd which allowed traffic from South Main St to Century Blvd. The construction was finished in January 2009.\n\nThe resident houses in the historical district on Salisbury St. were given an ordinance to renovate their homes to match the current renovations done to the roads leading into downtown along with the new bank and park added further downtown.

The new bridge includes stone side walls, sidewalks, and light posts.\n\nIn 2012, new landscaping was put into place around the Main Street exit and entrance ramps from B-40 business.\n\nBeginning in 2012, construction began to replace the Hastings Hill Road overpass bridge to B-40 business. The project is focused around replacing the outdated bridge as well as making the northern part of the road leading to the bridge a straight shot over B-40 business instead of the winding road it currently is. The project may include additional benefits such as exit/entrance ramps to B-40 business. Such access would eliminate the large distance between the closest exits (S. Main St. and Linville Rd.) and provide easier access for motorists to surrounding areas of the overpass.\n\nBeginning in Fall 2013, road construction began to incorporate a traffic circle to the intersection of W. Bodenhamer St. and Dobson St. The project is focused around decreasing the traffic congestion of the intersection around heavy traffic times. The project is estimated to complete in mid-2014.\n\nBeginning in Fall 2013, construction began on the Macy Grove Road overpass bridge to B-40 business. The project has so far been focused around replacing the old bridge but may include additional benefits such as exit/entrance ramps to B-40 business. Such access would provide much easier access for motorists to the Novant Health Kernersville Medical Center, the areas biggest hospital.\n\nThe intersection of Wallburg Road and Union Cross Road near Union Cross Park had been constructed to where motorists can simply head onto eastbound Union Cross Road and Wallburg Road which also featured installment of traffic lights.\n\n==Education==\n[[Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Schools]] serves the community.\n\nKernersville is served by five public elementary schools, three public middle schools, and two public high schools \u2013 [[Robert B.

Yarmouth was one of the towns called upon. Captain Joshua Gray, who commanded the militia, at once set forth, accompanied by a drummer, to call for volunteers. Everyone was ready and willing to go. The night was spent in preparation.

The ships were rotting at their docks and the men out of employment. Individuals, and the town as a corporate body, protested against the policy adopted.

On one occasion the Yarmouth company was a day and night in Barnstable, which was supposed to be threatened with an attack, and bivouacked in the courthouse. It was once or twice, under the same circumstances, marched to the south side, which was threatened by a visit from the invaders. Party spirit ran high, and the people of the town refused to take any other part in the hostilities, than to repel invasion.

Yarmouth was one of the towns called upon. Captain Joshua Gray, who commanded the militia, at once set forth, accompanied by a drummer, to call for volunteers. Everyone was ready and willing to go. The night was spent in preparation. In the chamber of the ancient house now standing at the corner of Hallet and Wharf streets, the mothers and daughters spent the night in molding bullets and making cartridges, and at early dawn eighty-one men, under the command of Captain Gray, were on the march for Dorchester.\"</ref> A meeting of Yarmouth citizens declared the town's independence from Great Britain on June 20, 1776.<ref>{{harvnb|Swift|1890|p=466}}: \"A meeting was held June 20, 1776, in which it was unanimously 'Voted, that the inhabitants of Yarmouth do declare a state of independence of the king of Great Britain, agreeably to a late resolve of the General Court, if in case the wisdom of Congress should see proper to do it.'

The ships were rotting at their docks and the men out of employment. Individuals, and the town as a corporate body, protested against the policy adopted.
