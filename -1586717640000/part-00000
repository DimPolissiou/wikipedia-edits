The Shades moved to [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], where the band's name changed to \"Little Daddy & the Bachelors\". They recorded a single, \"Too Much Monkey Business\" / \"Junior's Jerk\". Together with bandmember Bobby Taylor, Chong opened a Vancouver nightclub in 1963.  Formerly the Alma Theatre, they called it \"Blue Balls\". They brought in the [[Ike & Tina Turner]] Revue, which had never been to Vancouver before. Although Little Daddy & the Bachelors built up a small following, things soured when they went with Chong's suggestion and had themselves billed as \"Four [[Nigger]]s and a [[Chink]]\"<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web|author=Hamilton, Andrew|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/p130602|title=Bobby Taylor|work=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> (or, bowing to pressure, \"Four N's and a C\") before taking on the moniker [[Bobby Taylor & the Vancouvers]].<ref name=\"allmusic\" />\n\nIn 1965, the Vancouvers signed with Gordy Records (a subsidiary of Detroit's [[Motown Records]]). They recorded their debut album, an [[eponymous]] release, and their debut single, the Tommy Chong co-composition, \"Does Your Mama Know About Me,\" which peaked at number 29 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name=\"allmusic\" /> While on tour in Chicago for a short time, the band followed opening act [[the Jackson 5]].

Chong was fired by [[Chris Clark (singer)|Chris Clark]] and Motown producer [[Johnny Bristol]] for arriving late to the gig. Later, when Berry Gordy told Chong that he wasn't fired after all, that it had been a mistake, Chong said he wanted to stay fired. \"I said I want to become a Berry Gordy, I don't want to just work for a Berry Gordy. And he says I can, I can dig that. So he was nice.

His case never went to trial, as his attorney negotiated a plea agreement with the US Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania's Office. He admitted to distributing 7,500 bongs and water pipes on the Internet through Nice Dreams, a family company. Chong agreed to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute drug paraphernalia in exchange for non-prosecution of his wife, Shelby, and his son, Paris. Chong cooperated with the government and was the first of the Operation Pipe Dreams defendants to plead guilty.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nAt Chong's sentencing, Assistant U.S. Attorney for Western Pennsylvania Mary McKeen Houghton said in her arguments that Tommy Chong \"used his public image to promote this crime\" and marketed his products to children.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\">{{cite news |author=Torsten Ove | title=Chong Actor Tommy Chong gets nine months for selling pot pipes| date=September 13, 2003 | newspaper= Pittsburgh Post Gazette| url= http://www.post-gazette.com/localnews/20030912chong0912p5.asp}}</ref> U.S. Attorney [[Mary Beth Buchanan]] also was present at the sentencing in Pittsburgh and released a statement to the press stating, \"there are consequences for violating the law, even if the violator is a well-known entertainer like Thomas Chong.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nWhile Chong argued for community service and home detention at his sentencing, the district judge, [[Arthur J.

Together with bandmember Bobby Taylor, Chong opened a Vancouver nightclub in 1963.  Formerly the Alma Theatre, they called it \"Blue Balls\". They brought in the [[Ike & Tina Turner]] Revue, which had never been to Vancouver before.

Chong was fired by [[Chris Clark (singer)|Chris Clark]] and Motown producer [[Johnny Bristol]] for arriving late to the gig. Later, when Berry Gordy told Chong that he wasn't fired after all, that it had been a mistake, Chong said he wanted to stay fired. \"I said I want to become a Berry Gordy, I don't want to just work for a Berry Gordy.

His case never went to trial, as his attorney negotiated a plea agreement with the US Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania's Office. He admitted to distributing 7,500 bongs and water pipes on the Internet through Nice Dreams, a family company. Chong agreed to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute drug paraphernalia in exchange for non-prosecution of his wife, Shelby, and his son, Paris. Chong cooperated with the government and was the first of the Operation Pipe Dreams defendants to plead guilty.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nAt Chong's sentencing, Assistant U.S. Attorney for Western Pennsylvania Mary McKeen Houghton said in her arguments that Tommy Chong \"used his public image to promote this crime\" and marketed his products to children.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\">{{cite news |author=Torsten Ove | title=Chong Actor Tommy Chong gets nine months for selling pot pipes| date=September 13, 2003 | newspaper= Pittsburgh Post Gazette| url= http://www.post-gazette.com/localnews/20030912chong0912p5.asp}}</ref> U.S. Attorney [[Mary Beth Buchanan]] also was present at the sentencing in Pittsburgh and released a statement to the press stating, \"there are consequences for violating the law, even if the violator is a well-known entertainer like Thomas Chong.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nWhile Chong argued for community service and home detention at his sentencing, the district judge, [[Arthur J.

They questioned why Chong was prosecuted rather than his son Paris Chong, who was CEO of the business. They also pointed to the disparity in sentences between Chong's and those of other defendants and the DEA tactics used in the investigation.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nParis Chong had started Nice Dreams in 1999. He was never charged with his crimes in relation to the investigation as part of a plea bargain. When asked why the government had focused on Chong rather than his son the CEO, US Attorney Mary Beth Buchanan said that \"Tommy Chong was the more responsible corporate officer because he financed and marketed the product.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nOf the 55 people who were subjects of the investigation, Chong was the only one without previous convictions who received jail time.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> When questioned on the sentencing, U.S. Attorney Mary Beth Buchanan noted that Chong had never gone to trial and made a plea bargain.

They asked Paris Chong to sell them [[Water pipe percolator|pipes]] through the mail to a fictitious shop in the town of [[Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania|Beaver Falls]], {{convert|31|mi|km}} from Pittsburgh. Paris Chong had been prohibited from selling to Pittsburgh or anywhere in [[Western Pennsylvania]] because of the successful federal prosecution of Akhil Kumar Mishra and his wife, Rajeshwari, who had two head shops in the city.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> Accounts differ as to who in Nice Dreams went against Chong's prohibition, or even if it had been made up by the defense, but the sales did take place to the agents. This enabled the U.S. Attorney to show jurisdiction in Pennsylvania for Chong's illegal activities, as opposed to California, which was the base for Nice Dreams.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\n===Aftermath===\nIn December 2004, Chong was to appear in an off-Broadway show entitled ''[[The Marijuana-Logues]]'', a parody of [[Eve Ensler]]'s ''[[The Vagina Monologues]]''.

The search was one of nine conducted for [[Operation True Test]], an investigation being led by Buchanan, still the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania.

He won the [[2018 Open Championship]], his first and only [[Men's major golf championships|major]] victory, and the first major won by an Italian professional golfer.<ref name=guard /> The Open Championship win capped a successful season in which he won the [[2018 BMW PGA Championship]], his sixth win on the [[European Tour]], and the [[Quicken Loans National]], his first [[PGA Tour]] win. At the end of the season, Molinari won 5 out of 5 points as Europe won the [[2018 Ryder Cup]].\n\nMolinari has been in the top 100 of the World Rankings continuously since the end of 2008. Playing with his brother [[Edoardo Molinari|Edoardo]], they won the [[2009 Omega Mission Hills World Cup]], Italy's only win in the event. Molinari won the [[2010 WGC-HSBC Champions]] and has represented Europe in three winning [[Ryder Cup]] teams, in [[2010 Ryder Cup|2010]], [[2012 Ryder Cup|2012]] and [[2018 Ryder Cup|2018]].\n\n==Background and amateur career==\nMolinari was born in [[Turin]], [[Italy]], and is the younger brother of [[Edoardo Molinari]]. As an amateur, he won the Italian Amateur Stroke Play Championship twice, and the Italian Match Play Championship in 2004. He turned [[professional golf|professional]] later that year.\n\n==Professional career==\nMolinari earned his [[European Tour]] card for 2005 through [[qualifying school]]. He finished in 86th place on the tour's Order of Merit in his rookie season.\n\nIn May 2006, Molinari claimed his first European Tour victory, becoming the first Italian since [[Massimo Mannelli]] in 1980 to win the [[Telecom Italia Open]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/golf/4982674.stm |title=Molinari ends wait for home win |work=[[BBC Sport]] |date=7 May 2006 |accessdate=13 April 2009}}</ref> This victory helped him finish 38th on the Order of Merit. Molinari didn't win on Tour between 2007 and 2009 but during that time he recorded twenty top-10 finishes including three runner-up finishes. He finished 60th on the Order of Merit in 2007, 24th in 2008 and 14th in the Race to Dubai in 2009. In October 2009, Molinari reached the top 50 of the [[Official World Golf Ranking]] for the first time.\n\nOn 29 November 2009, Molinari, along with his older brother Edoardo, led Italy to their first [[2009 World Cup (men's golf)|World Cup]] victory at the Omega Mission Hills World Cup in China.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/golf/8384911.stm |title= Italy edge Ireland to win World Cup of Golf in China |date=29 November 2009 |work=BBC Sport |accessdate=30 November 2009}}</ref>\n\nOn 7 November 2010, Molinari won the [[WGC-HSBC Champions]] in [[Shanghai, China]]. He defeated [[Lee Westwood]] by one stroke, finishing at 19-under par.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/nov/07/francesco-molinari-lee-westwood-shanghai |title=Francesco Molinari holds his nerve to see off Lee Westwood in China |date=7 November 2010 |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=9 November 2010}}</ref> The win moved him into 14th in the Official World Golf Ranking, his highest ranking for eight years. He also recorded eleven top-10 finishes including two runner-up finishes en route to a 5th-place finish in the Race to Dubai.\n\nIn October 2010, he represented Europe in the [[2010 Ryder Cup]] which took place at [[Celtic Manor Resort]], teaming up with his brother Edoardo in the four-balls (halved against [[Stuart Cink]] and [[Matt Kuchar]]) and foursomes (lost against [[Zach Johnson]] and [[Hunter Mahan]]). He then lost the singles match by 4 and 3 against [[Tiger Woods]] on the final day. [[Europe]] defeated the [[United States]] 14\u00bd\u201313\u00bd.\n\nMolinari had a steady 2011 without any further victories but did record seven top-10 finishes, including a 3rd place at the [[WGC-Cadillac Championship]]. He finished the year ranked 21st in the Race to Dubai.\n\n[[File:Francesco Molinari Round 4 Open de France 2013 t144358.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Molinari at the 2013 Open de France]]\n[[File:Open de France 2015 16.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Molinari at the 2015 Open de France]]\nMolinari picked up his third win on the European Tour on 6 May 2012 at the [[Reale Seguros Open de Espa\u00f1a]]. He was four strokes out of the lead going into the final round but fired a 65 (\u22127), the best round of the tournament, to win by three strokes over [[Alejandro Ca\u00f1izares]], [[S\u00f8ren Kjeldsen]] and [[Pablo Larraz\u00e1bal]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.europeantour.com/europeantour/season=2012/tournamentid=2012026/news/newsid=159607.html#magic+final+round+secures+title+molinari |title=Magic Final Round Secures Title for Molinari |date=6 May 2012 |publisher=[[European Tour]] |accessdate=6 May 2012}}</ref> In July 2012, the week before the [[2012 Open Championship|Open Championship]], Molinari lost in a playoff at the [[Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open]]. He was defeated on the first playoff hole by [[Jeev Milkha Singh]].\n\nMolinari gained an automatic selection for the [[2012 Ryder Cup]], where he played the foursomes with [[Lee Westwood]] on Friday, losing by 3 and 2 to [[Jason Dufner]] and [[Zach Johnson]]; he then teamed up in the four-balls with [[Justin Rose]], losing by 5 and 4 against [[Bubba Watson]] and [[Webb Simpson]]. On the final day, he halved with [[Tiger Woods]] in the last singles match. The point meant Europe not only completed a comeback from 10\u20136 down at the start of the final day to retain the cup, but won it outright by a score of 14\u00bd points to 13\u00bd.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/01/ryder-cup-europe-win-medinah |title=Europe seal Ryder Cup win with comeback of epic proportions |date=1 October 2012 |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=3 October 2012 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the 2013 and 2014 seasons Molinari didn't register any win, but his steady position in the top fifty of the [[OWGR]] allowed him to play several [[PGA Tour]] events as a non-member, where he reached three top ten finishes; among these the most prestigious result was the 6th place at the [[2014 Players Championship]]. These results allowed him to earn a full PGA Tour card for the 2014\u201315 season.\n\nIn 2015 and 2016 Molinari shared his time between the European Tour and PGA Tour. In September 2016 he became the first Italian to win his national open twice with a 1 shot victory over [[Danny Willett]] at the 2016 [[Italian Open (golf)|Italian Open]]. Other notable results in Europe were the 2nd places collected at the 2015 [[Open de Espa\u00f1a]] and 2016 [[Open de France]], while in the U.S. he collected a 3rd place at the 2015 [[Memorial Tournament]]. In the same year he also recorded a hole in one at the iconic 16th hole of the [[Waste Management Phoenix Open]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Francesco Molinari's hole-in-one on No. 16 at Waste Management |date=31 January 2015 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpwVIVXq1w |accessdate=17 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nMolinari recorded his fifth European Tour win and first Rolex Series titles in May 2018, with victory in the European Tour's flagship event, the [[BMW PGA Championship]]. He produced a flawless final round to see off [[Rory McIlroy]] by two strokes. The win took Molinari level with [[Costantino Rocca]], for most European Tour wins by an Italian. In the same year, Molinari won the [[Quicken Loans National]] in a dominating fashion by shooting a 62 on Sunday to win by eight strokes, the first PGA Tour win for an Italian since 1947.\n\nAt the [[2018 Open Championship]], Molinari won the tournament with a score of \u22128, pairing with Tiger Woods in the final round.<ref name=guard>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/jul/22/the-open-2018-final-round-live |title=The Open 2018: Francesco Molinari wins title on day of drama \u2013 as it happened |newspaper=The Guardian |first=Scott |last=Murray |date=22 July 2018}}</ref> The win at the Open Championship moved him to sixth place in the Official World Golf Ranking, the highest ranking of his career to date.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/07/22/sport/british-open-carnoustie-final-round-golf-spt-intl/index.html |title=Francesco Molinari wins British Open as Tiger Woods falls short |date=23 July 2018 |website=CNN.com |first=Rob |last=Hodgetts |accessdate=23 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2018, Molinari qualified for the European team participating in the [[2018 Ryder Cup]]. Europe defeated the U.S. team 17 1/2 to 10 1/2. Molinari became the first player ever to go 5-0-0. He famously paired with [[Tommy Fleetwood]] to win all four fourball and foursome matches. He also won his singles match against [[Phil Mickelson]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thespec.com/sports-story/8936168-europe-wins-back-ryder-cup-beating-us-17-1-2-10-1-2/ |title=Europe wins back Ryder Cup, beating US 17 1/2-10 1/2 |agency=The Canadian Press |newspaper=The Hamilton Spectator |access-date=29 October 2018 |date=30 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn 18 November 2018, Molinari won the season-long [[Race to Dubai]] title on the [[European Tour]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.europeantour.com/europeantour/season=2018/tournamentid=2018090/news/newsid=361841.html |title=Molinari crowned Race to Dubai Champion |date=18 November 2018 |publisher=European Tour |access-date=18 November 2018}}</ref> The victory was worth $1,250,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://thegolfnewsnet.com/golfnewsnetteam/2018/11/15/2018-race-dubai-bonus-pool-purse-winners-share-prize-money-payout-111470/ |website=Golf News Net |title=2018 Race to Dubai bonus pool, purse, winner's share, prize money payout |access-date=18 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 December 2018, he received the 2018 BBC World Sport Star of the Year award (formerly known as the [[BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year]] award), Molinari was the first Italian to receive this prize.\n\nOn 10 March 2019, Molinari won the [[Arnold Palmer Invitational]] for his third PGA Tour victory of his career. He teed off 10 groups ahead of the leaders on the final day and 5 stokes behind, making three birdies and no bogeys on his first seven holes. On the 8th hole, from well off the green he holed a chip for another birdie and made the turn in 32 (\u22124). He made four more birdies on the back nine, including a 43-foot putt at the 72nd hole, to shoot a final-round 64 that ended up giving him a two-stroke win over [[Matthew Fitzpatrick]], who shot a final-round 71.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.golfdigest.com/story/the-secret-to-francesco-molinaris-recent-success-confidence-without-bravado |first=Dave |last=Shedloski |magazine=Golf Digest |date=10 March 2019 |access-date=11 March 2019 |title=The secret to Francesco Molinari's recent success? Confidence without bravado}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2019, Molinari was the 54-hole leader at the [[2019 Masters Tournament|Masters]] at 13 under, two strokes clear of [[Tony Finau]] and [[Tiger Woods]], after a six-under-par 66 third round. Molinari held the lead for two thirds of the final round, until he reached the par-3 12th, where his tee shot found the water, resulting in a double bogey. He found the water again on the 15th, which led to another double bogey to fall out of contention. He finished with a round of 74 and T5 finish, still his best performance at the Masters to date.\n\n==Coaches==\nMolinari has worked since 2018 with Dave Alred on several mental aspects of his

He won the [[2018 Open Championship]], his first and only [[Men's major golf championships|major]] victory, and the first major won by an Italian professional golfer.<ref name=guard /> The Open Championship win capped a successful season in which he won the [[2018 BMW PGA Championship]], his sixth win on the [[European Tour]], and the [[Quicken Loans National]], his first [[PGA Tour]] win. At the end of the season, Molinari won 5 out of 5 points as Europe won the [[2018 Ryder Cup]].\n\nMolinari has been in the top 100 of the World Rankings continuously since the end of 2008. Playing with his brother [[Edoardo Molinari|Edoardo]], they won the [[2009 Omega Mission Hills World Cup]], Italy's only win in the event. Molinari won the [[2010 WGC-HSBC Champions]] and has represented Europe in three winning [[Ryder Cup]] teams, in [[2010 Ryder Cup|2010]], [[2012 Ryder Cup|2012]] and [[2018 Ryder Cup|2018]].\n\n==Background and amateur career==\nMolinari was born in [[Turin]], [[Italy]], and is the younger brother of [[Edoardo Molinari]]. As an amateur, he won the Italian Amateur Stroke Play Championship twice, and the Italian Match Play Championship in 2004. He turned [[professional golf|professional]] later that year.\n\n==Professional career==\nMolinari earned his [[European Tour]] card for 2005 through [[qualifying school]]. He finished in 86th place on the tour's Order of Merit in his rookie season.\n\nIn May 2006, Molinari claimed his first European Tour victory, becoming the first Italian since [[Massimo Mannelli]] in 1980 to win the [[Telecom Italia Open]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/golf/4982674.stm |title=Molinari ends wait for home win |work=[[BBC Sport]] |date=7 May 2006 |accessdate=13 April 2009}}</ref> This victory helped him finish 38th on the Order of Merit. Molinari didn't win on Tour between 2007 and 2009 but during that time he recorded twenty top-10 finishes including three runner-up finishes. He finished 60th on the Order of Merit in 2007, 24th in 2008 and 14th in the Race to Dubai in 2009. In October 2009, Molinari reached the top 50 of the [[Official World Golf Ranking]] for the first time.\n\nOn 29 November 2009, Molinari, along with his older brother Edoardo, led Italy to their first [[2009 World Cup (men's golf)|World Cup]] victory at the Omega Mission Hills World Cup in China.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/golf/8384911.stm |title= Italy edge Ireland to win World Cup of Golf in China |date=29 November 2009 |work=BBC Sport |accessdate=30 November 2009}}</ref>\n\nOn 7 November 2010, Molinari won the [[WGC-HSBC Champions]] in [[Shanghai, China]]. He defeated [[Lee Westwood]] by one stroke, finishing at 19-under par.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/nov/07/francesco-molinari-lee-westwood-shanghai |title=Francesco Molinari holds his nerve to see off Lee Westwood in China |date=7 November 2010 |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=9 November 2010}}</ref> The win moved him into 14th in the Official World Golf Ranking, his highest ranking for eight years. He also recorded eleven top-10 finishes including two runner-up finishes en route to a 5th-place finish in the Race to Dubai.\n\nIn October 2010, he represented Europe in the [[2010 Ryder Cup]] which took place at [[Celtic Manor Resort]], teaming up with his brother Edoardo in the four-balls (halved against [[Stuart Cink]] and [[Matt Kuchar]]) and foursomes (lost against [[Zach Johnson]] and [[Hunter Mahan]]). He then lost the singles match by 4 and 3 against [[Tiger Woods]] on the final day. [[Europe]] defeated the [[United States]] 14\u00bd\u201313\u00bd.\n\nMolinari had a steady 2011 without any further victories but did record seven top-10 finishes, including a 3rd place at the [[WGC-Cadillac Championship]]. He finished the year ranked 21st in the Race to Dubai.\n\n[[File:Francesco Molinari Round 4 Open de France 2013 t144358.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Molinari at the 2013 Open de France]]\n[[File:Open de France 2015 16.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Molinari at the 2015 Open de France]]\nMolinari picked up his third win on the European Tour on 6 May 2012 at the [[Reale Seguros Open de Espa\u00f1a]]. He was four strokes out of the lead going into the final round but fired a 65 (\u22127), the best round of the tournament, to win by three strokes over [[Alejandro Ca\u00f1izares]], [[S\u00f8ren Kjeldsen]] and [[Pablo Larraz\u00e1bal]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.europeantour.com/europeantour/season=2012/tournamentid=2012026/news/newsid=159607.html#magic+final+round+secures+title+molinari |title=Magic Final Round Secures Title for Molinari |date=6 May 2012 |publisher=[[European Tour]] |accessdate=6 May 2012}}</ref> In July 2012, the week before the [[2012 Open Championship|Open Championship]], Molinari lost in a playoff at the [[Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open]]. He was defeated on the first playoff hole by [[Jeev Milkha Singh]].\n\nMolinari gained an automatic selection for the [[2012 Ryder Cup]], where he played the foursomes with [[Lee Westwood]] on Friday, losing by 3 and 2 to [[Jason Dufner]] and [[Zach Johnson]]; he then teamed up in the four-balls with [[Justin Rose]], losing by 5 and 4 against [[Bubba Watson]] and [[Webb Simpson]]. On the final day, he halved with [[Tiger Woods]] in the last singles match. The point meant Europe not only completed a comeback from 10\u20136 down at the start of the final day to retain the cup, but won it outright by a score of 14\u00bd points to 13\u00bd.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/01/ryder-cup-europe-win-medinah |title=Europe seal Ryder Cup win with comeback of epic proportions |date=1 October 2012 |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=3 October 2012 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the 2013 and 2014 seasons Molinari didn't register any win, but his steady position in the top fifty of the [[OWGR]] allowed him to play several [[PGA Tour]] events as a non-member, where he reached three top ten finishes; among these the most prestigious result was the 6th place at the [[2014 Players Championship]]. These results allowed him to earn a full PGA Tour card for the 2014\u201315 season.\n\nIn 2015 and 2016 Molinari shared his time between the European Tour and PGA Tour. In September 2016 he became the first Italian to win his national open twice with a 1 shot victory over [[Danny Willett]] at the 2016 [[Italian Open (golf)|Italian Open]]. Other notable results in Europe were the 2nd places collected at the 2015 [[Open de Espa\u00f1a]] and 2016 [[Open de France]], while in the U.S. he collected a 3rd place at the 2015 [[Memorial Tournament]]. In the same year he also recorded a hole in one at the iconic 16th hole of the [[Waste Management Phoenix Open]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Francesco Molinari's hole-in-one on No. 16 at Waste Management |date=31 January 2015 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpwVIVXq1w |accessdate=17 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nMolinari recorded his fifth European Tour win and first Rolex Series titles in May 2018, with victory in the European Tour's flagship event, the [[BMW PGA Championship]]. He produced a flawless final round to see off [[Rory McIlroy]] by two strokes. The win took Molinari level with [[Costantino Rocca]], for most European Tour wins by an Italian. In the same year, Molinari won the [[Quicken Loans National]] in a dominating fashion by shooting a 62 on Sunday to win by eight strokes, the first PGA Tour win for an Italian since 1947.\n\nAt the [[2018 Open Championship]], Molinari won the tournament with a score of \u22128, pairing with Tiger Woods in the final round.<ref name=guard>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/jul/22/the-open-2018-final-round-live |title=The Open 2018: Francesco Molinari wins title on day of drama \u2013 as it happened |newspaper=The Guardian |first=Scott |last=Murray |date=22 July 2018}}</ref> The win at the Open Championship moved him to sixth place in the Official World Golf Ranking, the highest ranking of his career to date.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/07/22/sport/british-open-carnoustie-final-round-golf-spt-intl/index.html |title=Francesco Molinari wins British Open as Tiger Woods falls short |date=23 July 2018 |website=CNN.com |first=Rob |last=Hodgetts |accessdate=23 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2018, Molinari qualified for the European team participating in the [[2018 Ryder Cup]]. Europe defeated the U.S. team 17 1/2 to 10 1/2. Molinari became the first player ever to go 5-0-0. He famously paired with [[Tommy Fleetwood]] to win all four fourball and foursome matches. He also won his singles match against [[Phil Mickelson]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thespec.com/sports-story/8936168-europe-wins-back-ryder-cup-beating-us-17-1-2-10-1-2/ |title=Europe wins back Ryder Cup, beating US 17 1/2-10 1/2 |agency=The Canadian Press |newspaper=The Hamilton Spectator |access-date=29 October 2018 |date=30 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn 18 November 2018, Molinari won the season-long [[Race to Dubai]] title on the [[European Tour]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.europeantour.com/europeantour/season=2018/tournamentid=2018090/news/newsid=361841.html |title=Molinari crowned Race to Dubai Champion |date=18 November 2018 |publisher=European Tour |access-date=18 November 2018}}</ref> The victory was worth $1,250,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://thegolfnewsnet.com/golfnewsnetteam/2018/11/15/2018-race-dubai-bonus-pool-purse-winners-share-prize-money-payout-111470/ |website=Golf News Net |title=2018 Race to Dubai bonus pool, purse, winner's share, prize money payout |access-date=18 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 December 2018, he received the 2018 BBC World Sport Star of the Year award (formerly known as the [[BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year]] award), Molinari was the first Italian to receive this prize.\n\nOn 10 March 2019, Molinari won the [[Arnold Palmer Invitational]] for his third PGA Tour victory of his career. He teed off 10 groups ahead of the leaders on the final day and 5 stokes behind, making three birdies and no bogeys on his first seven holes. On the 8th hole, from well off the green he holed a chip for another birdie and made the turn in 32 (\u22124). He made four more birdies on the back nine, including a 43-foot putt at the 72nd hole, to shoot a final-round 64 that ended up giving him a two-stroke win over [[Matthew Fitzpatrick]], who shot a final-round 71.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.golfdigest.com/story/the-secret-to-francesco-molinaris-recent-success-confidence-without-bravado |first=Dave |last=Shedloski |magazine=Golf Digest |date=10 March 2019 |access-date=11 March 2019 |title=The secret to Francesco Molinari's recent success?

Molinari held the lead for two thirds of the final round, until he reached the par-3 12th, where his tee shot found the water, resulting in a double bogey. He found the water again on the 15th, which led to another double bogey to fall out of contention. He finished with a round of 74 and T5 finish, still his best performance at the Masters to date.\n\n==Coaches==\nMolinari has worked since 2018 with Dave Alred on several mental aspects of his

[[Michael Douglas]] provides the sparse [[narration]] throughout the film.\n\nThe film won the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]] at the 72nd Academy Awards, on 26 March 2000, for films made in 1999.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-HL7b3ae8E Documentary Winners: 2000 Oscars]</ref>\n\n==Summary==\n\nThe documentary begins with an advertisement by the [[Munich]] Tourism Bureau with a beautiful young girl inviting the world to visit the city for the Olympics, then shows interviews with the wives of some of the murdered athletes, including Ankie Spitzer, widow of fencing coach [[Andre Spitzer]]. The film also features the first known filmed interview with [[Jamal Al-Gashey]], a surviving terrorist. Al-Gashey, who is in hiding in [[Africa]], wears a cap and sunglasses and his face is slightly blurred.\n\nThere are various shots of the Games getting under way, and attention is given to the lax security the Germans had at the Games. The terrorists are seen preparing for the assault; Al-Gashey claims that he and the other members were trained in [[Libya]] before going to [[West Germany]] to begin the assault.\n\nThe assault is described by Al-Gashey as well as by some of the German security staff present. Footage of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] anchor [[Jim McKay]] is interspersed, along with sound clips of [[Peter Jennings]], to give an impression of events unfolding as they happened. General [[Ulrich Wegener]], founder of the German counter-terrorist unit [[GSG 9]], was also interviewed during the film, and was roundly criticized for his seemingly flippant attitude about the subject matter.\n\nThe film offers evidence supporting the allegation that the [[Munich Massacre#Failed rescue|rescue operation]] was poorly planned and executed; for instance, the German police aboard the getaway aeroplane voted to abandon their mission without consulting the central command, while the snipers were not prepared and were poorly positioned. The film implies that had the German government prepared better, the athletes might have been saved. Former Mossad Director [[Zvi Zamir]], who was present at the airport during the final gunfight, is interviewed about his views on the failed rescue (he had previously been interviewed on this subject in an NBC profile of the Munich massacre broadcast during the Barcelona Olympics). At the end of the section, graphic photographs of the dead Israelis and Palestinians are shown in a photo-montage set to the [[Deep Purple]] song \"[[Child in Time]]\". \n\nThe film also alleges that the 29 October [[Lufthansa Flight 615|hijacking of a Lufthansa jet]] and the subsequent release of the three surviving Black September members in exchange for the hostages was a set-up by the German government, who did not want their failings to be made obvious in the trial.\n\n==Reception==\n\nAfter the film\u2019s release, film critic [[Roger Ebert]] penned a review recommending the film, stating that it \"grips the attention and is exciting and involving. I recommend it on that basis--and also because of the new information it contains\". He also stated that \"Macdonald brings remarkable research to the film\" and \"he relentlessly builds up a case against the way the Germans and the International Olympic Committee handled the crisis.\" However, Ebert criticized the style of the film, and the film's \"tasteless conclusion\", which included a montage of action shots and photos of victims' corpses with a rock music score.
