It was also the first to feature a new format with all twelve teams together in one venue over two days.\n\nThe competition was held at [[Franklin's Gardens]] on 28 and 29 July 2017.\n\n==Format==\nThe twelve teams were split into four groups \u2013 A, B, C & D.

The winners of each quarter-final qualified for the cup semi-finals, with the losers moving into a new plate tournament. Thereafter, competition was a simple knockout bracket, with the winner of the cup final being declared the series winner.\n\n==Group stage==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n!

The winners of each quarter-final qualified for the cup semi-finals, with the losers moving into a new plate tournament. Thereafter, competition was a simple knockout bracket, with the winner of the cup final being declared the series winner.\n\n==Group stage==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n!
