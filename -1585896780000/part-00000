In 2019, more than 26 million passengers arrived or departed at Brussels Airport, making it the 24th [[List of the busiest airports in Europe|busiest airport in Europe]]. It is located in the municipality of [[Zaventem]] in the [[Flemish Brabant|Province of Flemish Brabant]] in the [[Flemish Region]] of [[Belgium]]. It is home to around 260 companies, together directly employing 20,000 people and serves as the home base for [[Brussels Airlines]] and [[TUI fly Belgium]].\n\nThe company operating the airport is known as The Brussels Airport Company N.V./S.A.; before 19 October 2006, the name was BIAC (Brussels International Airport Company), which was created by Belgian law through a merger of BATC with the ground operations departments of the RLW/RVA. Since 2011, the airport has been owned by the [[Toronto]]-based [[Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan]] (39%), [[Macquarie Group]] (Macquarie European Infrastructure Fund I and Macquarie European Infrastructure Fund III) (36%) and the [[Federal Government of Belgium|Belgian State]] (25%).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-assigns-PBaa1-rating-to-Brussels-Airport-Holding-SANVs-senior--PR_273301|title=Moody's assigns (P)Baa1 rating to Brussels Airport Holding SA/NV's senior secured debt; stable outlook|work=Moodys.com|accessdate=2 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn 22 March 2016 the airport's departures hall was severely damaged by [[2016 Brussels bombings|two terrorist bomb blasts]].

There the [[Luftwaffe]] established '''Fliegerhorst Melsbroek''' and constructed 3 [[runway]]s in the shape of a triangle: runway 02/20, runway 07L/25R (both of which are still in use today) and runway 12/30. The airport buildings were constructed in the nearby municipality of Melsbroek and not of Zaventem, which is why the airfield was known to the locals as Melsbroek (in Dutch) (or \"Fliegerhorst Melsbroek\" in German). There is an [[urban legend]] that the site of the airport was chosen by the Germans after asking locals where to build it\u2013the Belgians then pointed to this location as it was often foggy.\n\nAfter the liberation on 3 September 1944, the German infrastructure at Melsbroek fell into the hands of the British. When the [[Evere Airport|old civilian airport]] in [[Haren, Belgium|Haren]] became too small, the Belgian authorities decided to use the aerodrome at Melsbroek for the new national airport. By 1948, a new [[airport terminal|terminal]] building was constructed to replace the old wooden building. In the same year, the lengths of both runways 02/20 and 07L/25R were increased, to {{convert|1200|m|abbr=on}} and {{convert|2450|m|abbr=on}} respectively, whereas 12/30 remained at {{convert|1300|m|abbr=on}}. The civil aerodrome of Melsbroek was officially opened by [[Prince Charles, Count of Flanders]], the [[Prince Regent]], on 20 July 1948. From 1948 to 1956 many more buildings and facilities were erected, mostly on the Melsbroek side of the site.\n\nIn 1955, a railway line from Brussels city centre to the airport was constructed. The line was officially opened by [[Baudouin I of Belgium|King Baudouin]] on 15 May 1955.\n\nIn 1956 a new {{convert|2300|m|abbr=on}} runway was constructed, 07R/25L, which almost runs parallel with 07L/25R. The runway is still in use today and saw its length later increased to {{convert|3200|m|abbr=on}}. In April 1956 the [[Belgian federal government|Belgian government]] decided to build a new airport, using the same runways, but with the buildings located within the municipality of Zaventem. In April 1957, construction started of the new terminal, preparing the airport for the [[Expo 58|1958 World Fair]]. The grass runway 12/30 had to make way to allow for the new passenger terminal. This new airport was inaugurated 5 July 1958, almost just in time for the 1958 World Fair. The buildings on the Melsbroek side are still in use by the [[Belgian Air Component|Belgian Air Force]] ([[15th Air Transport Wing]]), and this is still known as Melsbroek airfield. Both [[Zaventem Airport]] and [[Melsbroek Air Base]], the military airfield, share the same runways.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.innovativereport.com/brussels-explosion/|title=Brussels Explosion rocks Europe!|author=Robert Tom|work=Innovative Report|access-date=22 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220165822/http://www.innovativereport.com/brussels-explosion/|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Development since the 1960s===\n[[File:Boeing_707-329C,_Sabena_JP6848038.jpg|thumb|[[Sabena]] [[Boeing 707-300]] at Brussels Airport in 1966]]\n[[File:McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30, Air Zaire AN0199454.jpg|thumb|[[Air Za\u00efre]] [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]] at Brussels Airport at night in 1990]]\nDuring the boom of commercial aviation in the 1960s and 1970s, several hangars were constructed. A new [[Container terminal|cargo terminal]] was constructed in 1976. In 1994, a brand new terminal was constructed adjacent to the old 1958 building. Two old piers were torn down and replaced by modern ones. In 2002, amidst the turmoil surrounding the demise of the national airline [[Sabena]], a new pier was opened.\n\nIn 2005, the airport was awarded Best Airport in Europe by [[Airports Council International]]/[[International Air Transport Association]] (ACI/IATA), based on a survey of over 100,000 passengers worldwide. Brussels Airport continued to appear in top airports lists as of 2012. A direct train link with [[Leuven]] and [[Li\u00e8ge (city)|Li\u00e8ge]] was opened on 12 December 2005.\n\nIn 2007, the airport served 17.8 million passengers, an increase of 7% over 2006. The cargo volume in the same year amounted to 780,000 tonnes, an increase of 8.9% over 2006. In 2008, the airport served 18.5 million passengers, which was an increase of 3.7% over the previous year.<ref>Expatica: [http://www.expatica.com/be/news/local_news/Record-number-of-passengers-at-Brussels-airport_48886.html Record numbers of passengers at Brussels Airport]</ref>\n\nSabena's demise meant a sharp fall in passenger traffic, a blow from which the airport only slowly recovered. The airport's future is threatened by disagreement between the governments of [[Flanders]] and the Brussels Capital Region concerning night-time air traffic routes.\n\nIn March 2009, the old mechanical [[Flight information display system]]s were replaced by electronic ones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/942/Economie/article/detail/782602/2009/03/20/Brussels-Airport-vervangt-borden-met-vluchtinformatie.dhtml|title=Brussels Airport vervangt borden met vluchtinformatie|work=HLN|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611110827/http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/942/Economie/article/detail/782602/2009/03/20/Brussels-Airport-vervangt-borden-met-vluchtinformatie.dhtml|archivedate=11 June 2011}}</ref> In September 2009, CEO Wilfried Van Assche resigned. One of the (unofficial) reasons was the delay in the construction of the low-cost terminal and the possible lawsuit by 52 airlines active at Brussels Airport, on the grounds of tax discrimination. It was Van Assche who started expanding the Long-Haul network ([[Jet Airways]], [[Hainan Airlines]], [[Etihad Airways]] and [[US Airways]]) at Brussels Airport. In February 2010 Arnaud Feist was appointed CEO. The Chairman of the Board is Marc Descheemaecker.\n\n* On 18 February 2013, in the [[2013 Belgium diamond heist]], eight men armed with automatic weapons and dressed in police uniforms seized 120 small parcels containing an estimated US$50 million worth of diamonds from a [[Helvetic Airways]] [[Fokker 100]] passenger plane loaded with passengers preparing for departure to [[Z\u00fcrich]]. The men drove two vehicles through a hole they had cut in the airport perimeter fence to Flight LX789, which had just been loaded with diamonds from a [[Brink's]] armored van from [[Antwerp]]. They carried out the operation within five minutes with no injuries and without firing a shot.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/20/world/europe/thieves-steal-millions-in-diamonds-at-brussels-airport.html?_r=0 |title=Brazen Jewel Robbery at Brussels Airport Nets $50 Million in Diamonds |accessdate=20 February 2013|last=Higgins |first=Andrew |date=18 February 2013|work=New York Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Casert |first=Raf |url=http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/02/19/17013510-robbers-snatch-50-million-of-diamonds-off-plane-in-belgium?lite |title=Casert, Raf, \"Robbers Snatch $50 Million of Diamonds Off Plane in Belgium,\" Associated Press, February 19, 2013, 4:13 a.m |publisher=Worldnews.nbcnews.com |date=19 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221034721/http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/02/19/17013510-robbers-snatch-50-million-of-diamonds-off-plane-in-belgium?lite |archivedate=21 February 2013  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Casert |first=Raf |url=http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/02/19/17013510-robbers-snatch-50-million-of-diamonds-off-plane-in-belgium?lite |title=Smith, Vicky, \"The Great Plane Robbery: Gang of Fake Police Officers Steal \u00a332m of Diamonds in Airport Heist,\" Associated Press, February 19, 2013, 18:49 |publisher=Worldnews.nbcnews.com |date=19 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221034721/http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/02/19/17013510-robbers-snatch-50-million-of-diamonds-off-plane-in-belgium?lite |archivedate=21 February 2013  }}</ref>`\n\n=== 2016 Brussels bombings ===\n{{Main|2016 Brussels bombings}}\nOn 22 March 2016, two explosions took place in Brussels Airport at 07:58 local time.

A third bomb was found in the airport and detonated in a controlled explosion. The airport was closed after the attacks until 3 April, when it reopened with temporary facilities at less than 20% of its previous passenger capacity.<ref name=\"bloomberg.com\"/> Flights bound to Brussels Airport were either canceled or diverted to nearby airports such as [[Brussels South Charleroi Airport]], [[Ostend\u2013Bruges International Airport]], and [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Schiphol]].

The terminal building consists of several levels. The [[Brussels National Airport railway station|railway station]] is located on \u22121, buses and taxis arrive at 0, arrivals are located on level 2 and departures on level 3. Levels 2 and 3 are connected to the airport's two piers (A and B).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brusselsairport.be/nl/passngr/at_the_airport/airport_map/|title=Brussels Airport Website: Plattegrond terminal|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203014055/http://www.brusselsairport.be/nl/passngr/at_the_airport/airport_map/|archivedate=3 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Pier A===\nPier A is the newest pier on Brussels Airport and was opened on 15 May 2002. This pier was destined to support flights from and to the [[Schengen Agreement|Schengen]] countries (A-gates). However, since 15 October 2008 all [[Brussels Airlines]] flights to African destinations are also handled at this pier. Therefore, border control was installed towards the end of the pier in order to create a new pier. As a result, gates A61-72 were renamed T61-72. Later, Brussels Airlines' daily flight to New York was also moved here from pier B.\n\nUntil 26 March 2015,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brusselsairport.be/en/corporate/connector/connhome/|title=Brussels Airport Website:  Introduction|accessdate=2 June 2015}}</ref> Pier A was connected to the main building via a {{convert|400|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} tunnel under the apron. Each pier used to have its own security zone, so transfer between the piers involved a security check. This tunnel was replaced by the \"Connector\", a new building that links both piers above ground and allows passengers to walk straight from the check-in desk to their gate in pier A or B, without changing floors. In the opposite direction, the building provides arriving passengers with a smooth and convenient passage to the baggage reclaim hall and the exit. Furthermore, border control has been relocated behind the 25-lane screening platform (Europe's largest) inside the Connector which means that changing planes no longer requires a security check.\n\n===Pier B===\nPier B is the oldest pier still in use at Brussels Airport and is only used for flights outside the [[Schengen Area]]. Pier B is connected immediately to the main departure hall and consists of two decks. The upper deck (level 3) is at the same level as the departure halls and is used for the departing passengers, whereas the lower deck (level 2) is used for arriving passengers and connects immediately to border control and the [[Baggage claim|baggage claim area]].\n\n===Planned===\n\n====Pier A West====\nPier A West is a planned expansion of Pier A, and is meant to relieve Pier B by also handling flights from non-[[Schengen Agreement|Schengen]] countries. Pier A West was due to open in 2016, but because of the slow passenger growth, Brussels Airport announced in July 2013 that the works would be delayed. However, in November 2015, Brussels Airport announced a major 550 million euro investment and pointed out that within this investment the extension of the pier is included.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brusselsairport.be/en/mediaroom/news/66931/|title=Brussels Airport Website: Brussels Airport lowers airport tariffs by 5.2% and invests over \u20ac550 million in its infrastructure|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151221153852/http://www.brusselsairport.be/en/mediaroom/news/66931/|archivedate=21 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Low-cost pier====\nJust as is the case for Pier A West, the construction of a new [[Low-cost carrier|low-cost]] pier is currently on hold.

Ryanair announced on 27 November 10 new routes from Brussels Airport,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ryanair.com/en/news/ryanair-announces-brussels-zaventem-base-from-feb-2014|title=Welcome to Ryanair!|work=Ryanair.com}}</ref> although Brussels-South Charleroi Airport will remain the low-cost carrier's primary Belgian base.\n\n===Services===\nShops, bars and restaurants are scattered throughout the building. A few facilities are located in the departure area. These are mostly convenience stores and small shops such as the airport shop, a pharmacy, [[Relay (shop)|Relay]] stores and a coffee shop. But most of the facilities can only be accessed after Security control \u2013and are tax free. Several brands and chains have a branch in both piers, however several only operate in pier A. The airport also features places of worship (for [[Catholic Church|Catholics]], [[Jews]], [[Muslims]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]] and [[Protestants]]), as well as a place for meditation for [[Humanism|humanists]]. The airport provides meeting facilities and can host congresses up to 600 participants, either in the Regus Skyport Meeting Center or in the [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts|Sheraton]] Brussels Airport Hotel. The latter is the only hotel located on the airport grounds, opposite the terminal. Shuttle services are provided to 14 nearby hotels.\n\nAll passengers now have unlimited free Wi-Fi access.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brusselsairport.be/en/passngr/facilities/freewifi/|title=Brussels Airport Website:  Unlimited free Wi-Fi|website=www.brusselsairport.be|access-date=2016-05-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brusselsairport.be/en/passngr/services/internet_telephony/|title=Brussels Airport Website: Internet & Telephony}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/BrusselsAirport/status/951486523899371520|title=Brussels Airport on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-04-07|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThere is a small smoking room next to gate A67 in the transfer section of pier A.\n\n===Other facilities===\nSeveral airlines have or had its head offices at the grounds of Brussels Airport.

In 2019, more than 26 million passengers arrived or departed at Brussels Airport, making it the 24th [[List of the busiest airports in Europe|busiest airport in Europe]]. It is located in the municipality of [[Zaventem]] in the [[Flemish Brabant|Province of Flemish Brabant]] in the [[Flemish Region]] of [[Belgium]]. It is home to around 260 companies, together directly employing 20,000 people and serves as the home base for [[Brussels Airlines]] and [[TUI fly Belgium]].\n\nThe company operating the airport is known as The Brussels Airport Company N.V./S.A.; before 19 October 2006, the name was BIAC (Brussels International Airport Company), which was created by Belgian law through a merger of BATC with the ground operations departments of the RLW/RVA. Since 2011, the airport has been owned by the [[Toronto]]-based [[Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan]] (39%), [[Macquarie Group]] (Macquarie European Infrastructure Fund I and Macquarie European Infrastructure Fund III) (36%) and the [[Federal Government of Belgium|Belgian State]] (25%).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-assigns-PBaa1-rating-to-Brussels-Airport-Holding-SANVs-senior--PR_273301|title=Moody's assigns (P)Baa1 rating to Brussels Airport Holding SA/NV's senior secured debt; stable outlook|work=Moodys.com|accessdate=2 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn 22 March 2016 the airport's departures hall was severely damaged by [[2016 Brussels bombings|two terrorist bomb blasts]].

There the [[Luftwaffe]] established '''Fliegerhorst Melsbroek''' and constructed 3 [[runway]]s in the shape of a triangle: runway 02/20, runway 07L/25R (both of which are still in use today) and runway 12/30. The airport buildings were constructed in the nearby municipality of Melsbroek and not of Zaventem, which is why the airfield was known to the locals as Melsbroek (in Dutch) (or \"Fliegerhorst Melsbroek\" in German). There is an [[urban legend]] that the site of the airport was chosen by the Germans after asking locals where to build it\u2013the Belgians then pointed to this location as it was often foggy.\n\nAfter the liberation on 3 September 1944, the German infrastructure at Melsbroek fell into the hands of the British. When the [[Evere Airport|old civilian airport]] in [[Haren, Belgium|Haren]] became too small, the Belgian authorities decided to use the aerodrome at Melsbroek for the new national airport. By 1948, a new [[airport terminal|terminal]] building was constructed to replace the old wooden building. In the same year, the lengths of both runways 02/20 and 07L/25R were increased, to {{convert|1200|m|abbr=on}} and {{convert|2450|m|abbr=on}} respectively, whereas 12/30 remained at {{convert|1300|m|abbr=on}}. The civil aerodrome of Melsbroek was officially opened by [[Prince Charles, Count of Flanders]], the [[Prince Regent]], on 20 July 1948. From 1948 to 1956 many more buildings and facilities were erected, mostly on the Melsbroek side of the site.\n\nIn 1955, a railway line from Brussels city centre to the airport was constructed. The line was officially opened by [[Baudouin I of Belgium|King Baudouin]] on 15 May 1955.\n\nIn 1956 a new {{convert|2300|m|abbr=on}} runway was constructed, 07R/25L, which almost runs parallel with 07L/25R. The runway is still in use today and saw its length later increased to {{convert|3200|m|abbr=on}}. In April 1956 the [[Belgian federal government|Belgian government]] decided to build a new airport, using the same runways, but with the buildings located within the municipality of Zaventem. In April 1957, construction started of the new terminal, preparing the airport for the [[Expo 58|1958 World Fair]]. The grass runway 12/30 had to make way to allow for the new passenger terminal. This new airport was inaugurated 5 July 1958, almost just in time for the 1958 World Fair. The buildings on the Melsbroek side are still in use by the [[Belgian Air Component|Belgian Air Force]] ([[15th Air Transport Wing]]), and this is still known as Melsbroek airfield. Both [[Zaventem Airport]] and [[Melsbroek Air Base]], the military airfield, share the same runways.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.innovativereport.com/brussels-explosion/|title=Brussels Explosion rocks Europe!|author=Robert Tom|work=Innovative Report|access-date=22 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220165822/http://www.innovativereport.com/brussels-explosion/|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Development since the 1960s===\n[[File:Boeing_707-329C,_Sabena_JP6848038.jpg|thumb|[[Sabena]] [[Boeing 707-300]] at Brussels Airport in 1966]]\n[[File:McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30, Air Zaire AN0199454.jpg|thumb|[[Air Za\u00efre]] [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]] at Brussels Airport at night in 1990]]\nDuring the boom of commercial aviation in the 1960s and 1970s, several hangars were constructed. A new [[Container terminal|cargo terminal]] was constructed in 1976. In 1994, a brand new terminal was constructed adjacent to the old 1958 building. Two old piers were torn down and replaced by modern ones. In 2002, amidst the turmoil surrounding the demise of the national airline [[Sabena]], a new pier was opened.\n\nIn 2005, the airport was awarded Best Airport in Europe by [[Airports Council International]]/[[International Air Transport Association]] (ACI/IATA), based on a survey of over 100,000 passengers worldwide. Brussels Airport continued to appear in top airports lists as of 2012. A direct train link with [[Leuven]] and [[Li\u00e8ge (city)|Li\u00e8ge]] was opened on 12 December 2005.\n\nIn 2007, the airport served 17.8 million passengers, an increase of 7% over 2006. The cargo volume in the same year amounted to 780,000 tonnes, an increase of 8.9% over 2006. In 2008, the airport served 18.5 million passengers, which was an increase of 3.7% over the previous year.<ref>Expatica: [http://www.expatica.com/be/news/local_news/Record-number-of-passengers-at-Brussels-airport_48886.html Record numbers of passengers at Brussels Airport]</ref>\n\nSabena's demise meant a sharp fall in passenger traffic, a blow from which the airport only slowly recovered. The airport's future is threatened by disagreement between the governments of [[Flanders]] and the Brussels Capital Region concerning night-time air traffic routes.\n\nIn March 2009, the old mechanical [[Flight information display system]]s were replaced by electronic ones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/942/Economie/article/detail/782602/2009/03/20/Brussels-Airport-vervangt-borden-met-vluchtinformatie.dhtml|title=Brussels Airport vervangt borden met vluchtinformatie|work=HLN|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611110827/http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/942/Economie/article/detail/782602/2009/03/20/Brussels-Airport-vervangt-borden-met-vluchtinformatie.dhtml|archivedate=11 June 2011}}</ref> In September 2009, CEO Wilfried Van Assche resigned.

The terminal building consists of several levels. The [[Brussels National Airport railway station|railway station]] is located on \u22121, buses and taxis arrive at 0, arrivals are located on level 2 and departures on level 3. Levels 2 and 3 are connected to the airport's two piers (A and B).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brusselsairport.be/nl/passngr/at_the_airport/airport_map/|title=Brussels Airport Website: Plattegrond terminal|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203014055/http://www.brusselsairport.be/nl/passngr/at_the_airport/airport_map/|archivedate=3 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Pier A===\nPier A is the newest pier on Brussels Airport and was opened on 15 May 2002. This pier was destined to support flights from and to the [[Schengen Agreement|Schengen]] countries (A-gates). However, since 15 October 2008 all [[Brussels Airlines]] flights to African destinations are also handled at this pier. Therefore, border control was installed towards the end of the pier in order to create a new pier. As a result, gates A61-72 were renamed T61-72. Later, Brussels Airlines' daily flight to New York was also moved here from pier B.\n\nUntil 26 March 2015,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brusselsairport.be/en/corporate/connector/connhome/|title=Brussels Airport Website:  Introduction|accessdate=2 June 2015}}</ref> Pier A was connected to the main building via a {{convert|400|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} tunnel under the apron. Each pier used to have its own security zone, so transfer between the piers involved a security check. This tunnel was replaced by the \"Connector\", a new building that links both piers above ground and allows passengers to walk straight from the check-in desk to their gate in pier A or B, without changing floors. In the opposite direction, the building provides arriving passengers with a smooth and convenient passage to the baggage reclaim hall and the exit. Furthermore, border control has been relocated behind the 25-lane screening platform (Europe's largest) inside the Connector which means that changing planes no longer requires a security check.\n\n===Pier B===\nPier B is the oldest pier still in use at Brussels Airport and is only used for flights outside the [[Schengen Area]]. Pier B is connected immediately to the main departure hall and consists of two decks. The upper deck (level 3) is at the same level as the departure halls and is used for the departing passengers, whereas the lower deck (level 2) is used for arriving passengers and connects immediately to border control and the [[Baggage claim|baggage claim area]].\n\n===Planned===\n\n====Pier A West====\nPier A West is a planned expansion of Pier A, and is meant to relieve Pier B by also handling flights from non-[[Schengen Agreement|Schengen]] countries. Pier A West was due to open in 2016, but because of the slow passenger growth, Brussels Airport announced in July 2013 that the works would be delayed. However, in November 2015, Brussels Airport announced a major 550 million euro investment and pointed out that within this investment the extension of the pier is included.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brusselsairport.be/en/mediaroom/news/66931/|title=Brussels Airport Website: Brussels Airport lowers airport tariffs by 5.2% and invests over \u20ac550 million in its infrastructure|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151221153852/http://www.brusselsairport.be/en/mediaroom/news/66931/|archivedate=21 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Low-cost pier====\nJust as is the case for Pier A West, the construction of a new [[Low-cost carrier|low-cost]] pier is currently on hold.

A few facilities are located in the departure area. These are mostly convenience stores and small shops such as the airport shop, a pharmacy, [[Relay (shop)|Relay]] stores and a coffee shop. But most of the facilities can only be accessed after Security control \u2013and are tax free. Several brands and chains have a branch in both piers, however several only operate in pier A. The airport also features places of worship (for [[Catholic Church|Catholics]], [[Jews]], [[Muslims]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]] and [[Protestants]]), as well as a place for meditation for [[Humanism|humanists]].

HIV sequences obtained from these two patients using modern sequencing technologies showed that HIV genes were inactivated by replacement of tryptophan codons by stop codons, which is probably due to the action of a cellular enzyme, APOBEC. This work is a paradigm shift in HIV research that considered eradication of any HIV DNA from patients cells as a necessary step towards a possible cure. It provides opportunities for assessment of the chances for patients of a spontaneously favorable course of HIV infection, and for treatment through the use of APOBEC.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1469-0691.12807 |pmid=25366539 |pmc=4360783 |title=HIV infection en route to endogenization: Two cases |journal=Clinical Microbiology and Infection |volume=20 |issue=12 |pages=1280\u20138 |year=2014 |last1=Colson |first1=P |last2=Ravaux |first2=I |last3=Tamalet |first3=C |last4=Glazunova |first4=O |last5=Baptiste |first5=E |last6=Chabriere |first6=E |last7=Wiedemann |first7=A |last8=Lacabaratz |first8=C |last9=Chefrour |first9=M |last10=Picard |first10=C |last11=Stein |first11=A |last12=Levy |first12=Y |last13=Raoult |first13=D }}</ref>\n\n== Controversies ==\n\n=== Ban from publishing in the American Society for Microbiology ===\nIn 2006, Raoult and four other co-authors were banned for one year from publishing in the journals of the [[American Society for Microbiology]], after a reviewer for ''[[Infection and Immunity]]'' discovered that two images in a figure from the revised manuscript of a paper about mouse modelling for [[typhus]] were identical to figures from the originally submitted manuscript, even though they were supposed to represent a different experiment.

Delgado was the team leader for the Tour de France while [[Miguel Indurain]] and [[Juli\u00e1n Gorospe]] were the leaders for the week long stage races. When Gorospe took the lead in that year's Vuelta, the team went behind him in a bid to win the race. However Gorospe lost the leader's jersey and Delgado took over the leadership but could not regain the time that Italian [[Marco Giovannetti]] had gained and ended the race second overall behind Giovannetti. Over the following years, Indurain rose to become a dominator of stage races winning five editions of the Tour de France and two editions of the [[Giro d'Italia]]. Delgado was the team leader for the Vuelta. The team also achieved success with [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Bernard]] who won the 1992 edition of Paris\u2013Nice with the team. The team won the Vuelta again in 1998 with [[Abraham Olano]]. During this time Alex Z\u00fclle joined the team and finished the [[1999 Tour de France]] second overall while legendary climber [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Jim\u00e9nez]] performed in the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a.

Caisse d'Epargne took over from Banesto as the second sponsor in the 2005 season, the team was then known as '''Illes Balears-Caisse d'Epargne'''. Caisse d'Epargne then became the main sponsor in 2006 reversing the  title sponsor ordering with the name, '''Caisse d'Epargne-Illes Balears'''.\n\nThe team fielded a number of strong contenders in the [[2005 Tour de France]] including Francisco Mancebo ([[Spanish National Road Race Championships|former National Champion of Spain]]), [[Alejandro Valverde]], [[Vladimir Karpets]] and sprinter [[Isaac G\u00e1lvez]].

The team found success with stage wins in the [[Volta a Catalunya]] and [[Tour of the Basque Country]]. The team also won two stages of the [[Giro d'Italia]]: Ventoso won stage 6 and [[Vasil Kiryienka]] won stage 20. The team's final Grand Tour win came courtesy of [[Rui Costa (cyclist)|Rui Costa]] in the [[Tour de France]].\n\nThe 2012 season saw the team re-establish itself as one of the major general classification contenders. The return of Valverde almost immediately brought the team success with a stage win in the Tour Down Under, followed by the overall win of the [[Vuelta a Andaluc\u00eda]] as well as a stage win. Colombian new recruit [[Nairo Quintana]] also brought the team overall victory at the [[Vuelta a Murcia]]. The team scored multiple overall classification victories; Quintana claimed the [[Route du Sud]], Rui Costa the [[Tour de Suisse]], [[Javier Moreno (cyclist)|Javier Moreno]] the [[Vuelta a Castilla y Le\u00f3n]] and finally [[Be\u00f1at Intxausti]] won the  [[Vuelta a Asturias]]. The team also won stages in all three Grand Tours.\n\nThe 2013 season closely followed the previous years, Valverde scored multiple early season results with the [[Trofeo Serra de Tramuntana]] and an overall win in the [[Vuelta a Andaluc\u00eda]]. Quintana further reinforced his potential as a Grand Tour GC rider with the overall win in the Tour of the Basque Country as well as claiming second place in the [[2013 Tour de France|Tour de France]], taking the King of the Mountains in addition to the Young rider classification. He further reinforced his reputation as a force to be reckoned with, with an overall win in the [[Vuelta a Burgos]]. Intxausti got the team's final overall win of the year and Costa won the UCI World Road Race championships. For the 2014 season the team confirmed that they would shift from [[Pinarello]] bikes to [[Canyon Bicycles]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/movistar-to-ride-canyon-in-2014|title=Movistar to ride Canyon in 2014|author=Cycling News|work=Cyclingnews.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20141015084129/http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/movistar-to-ride-canyon-in-2014|archivedate=15 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nFor 2014, the team adopted a 'divide and conquer' based tactic for the season's Grand Tours; first sending Quintana to the Giro, Valverde to the Tour and then finally both riders to the Vuelta. Quintana achieved the team's first victory - winning stage 4 of the [[Tour de San Luis]] as well as the overall classification, [[Adriano Malori]] also won the individual time trial stage.

In 1984, [[Miguel Indurain]] made his professional debut with the team.\n\n===Banesto (1990\u20132003)===\nIn 1990, Spanish bank Banesto took over as the main sponsor of the team from Reynolds. Delgado was the team leader for the Tour de France while [[Miguel Indurain]] and [[Juli\u00e1n Gorospe]] were the leaders for the week long stage races. When Gorospe took the lead in that year's Vuelta, the team went behind him in a bid to win the race. However Gorospe lost the leader's jersey and Delgado took over the leadership but could not regain the time that Italian [[Marco Giovannetti]] had gained and ended the race second overall behind Giovannetti. Over the following years, Indurain rose to become a dominator of stage races winning five editions of the Tour de France and two editions of the [[Giro d'Italia]]. Delgado was the team leader for the Vuelta. The team also achieved success with [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Bernard]] who won the 1992 edition of Paris\u2013Nice with the team. The team won the Vuelta again in 1998 with [[Abraham Olano]]. During this time Alex Z\u00fclle joined the team and finished the [[1999 Tour de France]] second overall while legendary climber [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Jim\u00e9nez]] performed in the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a.

Caisse d'Epargne took over from Banesto as the second sponsor in the 2005 season, the team was then known as '''Illes Balears-Caisse d'Epargne'''. Caisse d'Epargne then became the main sponsor in 2006 reversing the  title sponsor ordering with the name, '''Caisse d'Epargne-Illes Balears'''.\n\nThe team fielded a number of strong contenders in the [[2005 Tour de France]] including Francisco Mancebo ([[Spanish National Road Race Championships|former National Champion of Spain]]), [[Alejandro Valverde]], [[Vladimir Karpets]] and sprinter [[Isaac G\u00e1lvez]].

The team found success with stage wins in the [[Volta a Catalunya]] and [[Tour of the Basque Country]]. The team also won two stages of the [[Giro d'Italia]]: Ventoso won stage 6 and [[Vasil Kiryienka]] won stage 20. The team's final Grand Tour win came courtesy of [[Rui Costa (cyclist)|Rui Costa]] in the [[Tour de France]].\n\nThe 2012 season saw the team re-establish itself as one of the major general classification contenders.

He further reinforced his reputation as a force to be reckoned with, with an overall win in the [[Vuelta a Burgos]].

Initially, Sathya thinks that his job is just as mundane as his girlfriend Nisha ([[Hansika Motwani]]) who works in an call center. However, that one call which he misses involved the life of a kidnapped small boy. Sathya nabs the criminals behind the kidnapping, but soon the 100th emergency call that he receives will be the one which turns his life upside-down. Sathya comes to know that a young girl who was declared dead is alive and has been kidnapped and kept by a criminal.

The law further says that it should not be interpreted as compromising the status of the [[Arabic]] language in practice prior to the enactment of the basic law, namely, it preserves the status quo and changes the status of Hebrew and Arabic only nominally.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/world/middleeast/israel-law-jews-arabic.html|title=Israeli Law Declares the Country the 'Nation-State of the Jewish People'|last=Halbfinger|first=David M.|date=19 July 2018|work=New York Times|access-date=2018-07-24|last2=Kershner|first2=Isabel|language=en}}</ref>\n\nBefore the enactment of the aforementioned basic law, the status of official language in Israel was determined by the 82nd paragraph of the \"[[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] [[Order in Council]]\" issued on [https://web.archive.org/web/20081221030238/http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/361eea1cc08301c485256cf600606959/c7aae196f41aa055052565f50054e656!OpenDocument 14 August 1922], for the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate of Palestine]], as amended in 1939:<ref>''The Palestine Gazette'', No. 898 of 29 June 1939, Supplement 2, pp. 464\u2013465.</ref>\n\nAll Ordinances, official notices and official forms of the Government and all official notices of local authorities and municipalities in areas to be prescribed by order of the High Commissioner, shall be published in English, Arabic, and Hebrew.\"\n\nThis law, like most other laws of the British Mandate, was adopted in the State of Israel, subject to certain amendments published by the provisional legislative branch on 19 May 1948. The amendment states that:\n\n:\"Any provision in the law requiring the use of the English language is repealed.\"<ref name=IL1>Law and Administration Ordinance No 1 of 5708\u20141948, clause 15(b).

Other public schools have Arabic as their main teaching language, and they teach Hebrew as a second language and English as a third one. There are also bilingual schools which aim to teach in both Hebrew and Arabic equally.\n\nSome languages other than Hebrew and Arabic, such as English, Russian, [[Amharic]], [[Yiddish]] and [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]] enjoy a somewhat special status, but are not considered{{by whom|date=November 2017}} to be official languages. For instance, at least 5% of the broadcasting time of privately owned TV-channels must be translated into Russian (a similar privilege is granted to Arabic), warnings must be translated to several languages, signs are mostly trilingual (Hebrew, Arabic and English), and the government supports Yiddish and Ladino culture (alongside Hebrew culture and Arabic culture).\n\n===Latvia===\nThe [[Constitution of Latvia]] (or Satversme) designated [[Latvian language|Latvian]] as the state language.

Krist\u012bne Jarinovska in her analysis describes the proposal in the following way:\n\n<blockquote>It proposed several constitutional amendments for introducing Russian as Latvia's second official language\u2014i.e., amendments to the Satversme\u2019s Articles 4 (on Latvian as the state language), 18 (on the solemn promise of a member of Parliament to strengthen the Latvian language), 21 (on Latvian as the working language of the Parliament), 101 (on Latvian as the working language of local governments), and 104 (on the right to receive a reply to a petition in Latvian). Obviously, the proposed amendments would have influenced other constitutional norms as well. Moreover, since Article 4 of the Satversme alike norms of independence, democracy, sovereignty, territorial wholeness, and basic principles of elections that form the core of the Satversme (according to Article 77 of the Satversme), the initiative, in fact, proposed discontinuing an existing state and establishing a new one that is no longer a nation-state wherein Latvians exercise their rights to self-determination, enjoying and maintaining their cultural uniqueness<ref>[http://www.juridicainternational.eu/index.php?id=15331 Jarinovska, K. \"Popular Initiatives as Means of Altering the Core of the Republic of Latvia\", ''Juridica International''.

The law further says that it should not be interpreted as compromising the status of the [[Arabic]] language in practice prior to the enactment of the basic law, namely, it preserves the status quo and changes the status of Hebrew and Arabic only nominally.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/world/middleeast/israel-law-jews-arabic.html|title=Israeli Law Declares the Country the 'Nation-State of the Jewish People'|last=Halbfinger|first=David M.|date=19 July 2018|work=New York Times|access-date=2018-07-24|last2=Kershner|first2=Isabel|language=en}}</ref>\n\nBefore the enactment of the aforementioned basic law, the status of official language in Israel was determined by the 82nd paragraph of the \"[[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] [[Order in Council]]\" issued on [https://web.archive.org/web/20081221030238/http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/361eea1cc08301c485256cf600606959/c7aae196f41aa055052565f50054e656!OpenDocument 14 August 1922], for the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate of Palestine]], as amended in 1939:<ref>''The Palestine Gazette'', No. 898 of 29 June 1939, Supplement 2, pp. 464\u2013465.</ref>\n\nAll Ordinances, official notices and official forms of the Government and all official notices of local authorities and municipalities in areas to be prescribed by order of the High Commissioner, shall be published in English, Arabic, and Hebrew.\"\n\nThis law, like most other laws of the British Mandate, was adopted in the State of Israel, subject to certain amendments published by the provisional legislative branch on 19 May 1948. The amendment states that:\n\n:\"Any provision in the law requiring the use of the English language is repealed.\"<ref name=IL1>Law and Administration Ordinance No 1 of 5708\u20141948, clause 15(b).

Other public schools have Arabic as their main teaching language, and they teach Hebrew as a second language and English as a third one. There are also bilingual schools which aim to teach in both Hebrew and Arabic equally.\n\nSome languages other than Hebrew and Arabic, such as English, Russian, [[Amharic]], [[Yiddish]] and [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]] enjoy a somewhat special status, but are not considered{{by whom|date=November 2017}} to be official languages. For instance, at least 5% of the broadcasting time of privately owned TV-channels must be translated into Russian (a similar privilege is granted to Arabic), warnings must be translated to several languages, signs are mostly trilingual (Hebrew, Arabic and English), and the government supports Yiddish and Ladino culture (alongside Hebrew culture and Arabic culture).\n\n===Latvia===\nThe [[Constitution of Latvia]] (or Satversme) designated [[Latvian language|Latvian]] as the state language. In 2012 there was initiative to hold [[2012 Latvian constitutional referendum|a referendum]] on constitutional amendments, elevating [[Russian language|Russian]] as a state language. Krist\u012bne Jarinovska in her analysis describes the proposal in the following way:\n\n<blockquote>It proposed several constitutional amendments for introducing Russian as Latvia's second official language\u2014i.e., amendments to the Satversme\u2019s Articles 4 (on Latvian as the state language), 18 (on the solemn promise of a member of Parliament to strengthen the Latvian language), 21 (on Latvian as the working language of the Parliament), 101 (on Latvian as the working language of local governments), and 104 (on the right to receive a reply to a petition in Latvian). Obviously, the proposed amendments would have influenced other constitutional norms as well. Moreover, since Article 4 of the Satversme alike norms of independence, democracy, sovereignty, territorial wholeness, and basic principles of elections that form the core of the Satversme (according to Article 77 of the Satversme), the initiative, in fact, proposed discontinuing an existing state and establishing a new one that is no longer a nation-state wherein Latvians exercise their rights to self-determination, enjoying and maintaining their cultural uniqueness<ref>[http://www.juridicainternational.eu/index.php?id=15331 Jarinovska, K. \"Popular Initiatives as Means of Altering the Core of the Republic of Latvia\", ''Juridica International''.

Eventually, he was dismissed by police for having a solid alibi, and obtained compensation from a newspaper that had branded him as [[Jack the Ripper]].\n\n== Sadler and the murder of Frances Coles ==\nWhen the mutilated corpse of a 25-year-old woman was located at 5 o'clock in the morning of February 13, 1891, the police undertook an extensive search that concluded with the arrest of the victim's boyfriend. The girl's name was Frances Coles and she was a well-known prostitute. Her occasional companion turned out to be a much older man - James Thomas Sadler, a naval engineer and fireman.\n\nHis behavior during the dawn of the crime made him a suspect. He had gone with the girl to the guest house where she lived, as seen by the landlord. The man appeared disheveled. Sadler retired from the apartment shortly after 1:30 in the morning and, moments later, Coles left alone on her way to the Shallow Gardens neighborhood, where she would later be found dying by the Metropolitan Police Officer Ernest William Thompson.<ref>''[http://www.casebook.org/police_officials/po-ernest_thompson.html P.C.

Profuse blood stains were splashed on his clothes and he appeared very upset. He told the landlord that some ruffians assaulted him and stripped him of his gold watch. Despite his resistance, Sadler endured a hard beating and asked the landlord if he could spend the night there. However, the landlord was suspicious of the story and refused to accommodate Sadler, instead suggesting that he go to the London Hospital in [[Whitechapel]] to heal his wounds.\n\nThe following day, when the landlord learned that his tenant had been killed, he was convinced that it was the same man from yesterday. He phoned the authorities and reported Sadler to the police, who quickly arrested him and drove to the police station located on Leman Street.\n\nWord spread in the neighborhood that the prisoner, in addition to being Coles' killer, was also the hated Jack the Ripper. Soon, the commissioner of Leman Street was besieged by an angry crowd. For security reasons, the policemen took Sadler through a side door, but the mob noticed and, shouting \"Murderer!\" and attacked with the intention of lynching Sadler. The policemen were forced to use their batons to save the detainee's life, who, apart from insults and threats, received several punches to the face, leaving him bloodied up.<ref>Gabriel Pombo, ''[http://books.google.com.uy/books?id=4qSeiT2OeFEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=la+leyenda+contin%C3%BAa&hl=es&sa=X&ei=zmVFUeLDBuHk4AOn6YGABw&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=la%20leyenda%20contin%C3%BAa&f=false Jack el Destripador: La leyenda contin\u00faa]'', Editorial Artemisa, Montevideo, Uruguay (2008), p\u00e1gs. 44-47.</ref><ref>Gabriel Pombo, ''[https://books.google.com.uy/books?id=t1CDCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&hl=es#v=onepage&q&f=false Jack el Destripador: La leyenda contin\u00faa (reedici\u00f3n ampliada, en google libros)]'', editorial Torre del Vig\u00eda, Montevideo, 2015, {{ISBN|978 9974 99 868 1}}, pp. 30-33.</ref>\n\n== Judicial action and police investigation ==\nWhen questioned, the prisoner admitted having accompanied the woman on the afternoon of February 11, 1891 - the same day, he had been fired from one of the boats where he worked. He said that he had met her 18 months ago while on leave, and from then on, met Frances several more times. On the eve of the killing, on February 12, the couple spent their time drinking from tavern to tavern and, when they separated, she had bought a new hat and he was the victim of a robbery. Sadler insisted that he left Coles in the guest house around 2 o'clock in the morning, and never saw her again.\n\nThe acting judge ordered the suspect be held in [[Holloway Prison]]. Soon, very damaging circulations appeared against him, where his responsibility for the girl's death was taken for granted, and that, undoubtedly, he was Jack the Ripper. The smear campaign became so overblown that the English Interior Minister expressed his displeasure before Parliament about the newspapers, which sought to satisfy the public's thirst for sensationalism.\n\nThe prisoners, in turn, proclaimed his innocence constantly, and one of the newspapers picked up on his complaints: \"What a blessing my case will be for the police!\" - he exclaimed in an ironic argument; \"They would solve all the unsolved crimes if they could only send me, no matter how innocent I am, to the gallows\".<ref>Colin Wilson, Robin Odell, ''[http://books.google.com.uy/books?id=lCVAAAAACAAJ&dq=recapitulacion+wilson+colin&hl=es&sa=X&ei=AmZFUfa4IcXh4AOdv4DoBw&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA Jack el Destripador: Recapitulaci\u00f3n y veredicto]'', obra citada, p\u00e1g. 92.</ref>\n\nHarry Wilson, a lawyer hired by the firemen's guild to which the accused belonged, defended his client skillfully. He demonstrated the truthfulness of the street attack suffered that night, and succeeded in getting boat captains to provide testimony for the court. Finally, Sadler's cause was dismissed due to lack of evidence.\n\nPolice also investigated his movements during Jack the Ripper's killing spree. For example, it was found that from July 16 to 20, 1888, he was not in the area where [[Whitechapel murders|Alice McKenzie]] was killed on July 17, given that he worked until July 20 on the ''SS Fez'', docked at Chatham Harbor. This excluded him as the woman's killer, and was further reinforced by witness Capt. Donald Cameron, whom Sadler worked for. This information is contained in the report from the CID of [[Scotland Yard]], prepared on March 3, 1891 by inspector Henry Moore and Superintendent Thomas Arnold.<ref>''[http://www.casebook.org/police_officials/po-henry_moore.html Henry Moore (inspector jefe)]'', informaci\u00f3n subordinada a la p\u00e1gina ''[http://www.casebook.org/police_officials/ List of police who were involved in investigating the Whitechapel murders]''.</ref><ref>''[http://www.casebook.org/police_officials/po-arnld.html Thomas Arnold (superintendente)]'', informaci\u00f3n subordinada a la p\u00e1gina ''[http://www.casebook.org/police_officials/ List of police who were involved in investigating the Whitechapel murders]''.</ref> That report concluded by highlighting that after the exoneration of Sadler, there were no other prisoners charged with the killing of Frances Coles.<ref>Stewart Evans, Keith Skiner, ''[http://books.google.com.uy/books?id=8ISERAAACAAJ&dq=evans+skinner+ultimate&hl=es&sa=X&ei=L2ZFUf7uF7Gp4AOQvYC4AQ&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook]'', Editorial Constable and Robinson, Londres, Inglaterra (2001), p\u00e1gs. 627-628.</ref>\n\n== Press accusations ==\nOnce the defendant was released, the media could no longer proclaim that he was guilty, but they did not cease invoking Jack the Ripper. For example, ''The Spectator'' said: \"There is no doubt that no matter how long the suspicions are, Sadler did not kill the woman; and it is more than possible, probable, that the one who killed her was Jack the Ripper, the nickname that the people have given to the systematic assassin of Whitechapel prostitutes.\"<ref>Stewart Evans, Paul Gainey, ''[http://books.google.com.uy/books?id=iWKAWiI96sMC&dq=evans+gainey+first+killer&hl=es&sa=X&ei=ZGZFUcOVGLDh4APBz4Fg&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA Jack the Ripper: First American Serial Killer]'', Editorial Kodansha International, Londres, Inglaterra (1996), p\u00e1g. 156.</ref>\n\nIt was also speculated - more by journalists than detectives - that witnesses to the crimes would have identified the fireman. As claimed by the ''Daily Telegraph'', Joseph Lawende may have alluded to Sadler when he described the companion of [[Catherine Eddowes]] in Miter Square during the early hours of September 30, 1888. It was also alleged that he could've been the subject surprised by Israel Schwart prior to the murder of [[Elizabeth Stride]]. Nor it was ruled out that Chief Robert Anderson really accused him, and that he erroneously mentioned that the principal suspect was of [[Jews|Jewish]] origin.<ref>Paul Begg, ''[http://books.google.com.uy/books?id=q9PaAAAAMAAJ&q=paul+begg+history&dq=paul+begg+history&hl=es&sa=X&ei=iWZFUaSACrLB4APqwIHYCQ&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History]'', Editorial Pearson Education Ltd, Londres, Inglaterra (2005), p\u00e1gs. 341-342.</ref>\n\nThe reporters did not leave the sailor alone, even after release. He was constantly asked if he had participated in the other murders, to which he replied that he had been falsely accused and was never present at the crime scenes. According to each case, he was either embarked or in a distant place from where the deaths occurred (note edited by the ''East London Observer'' on March 28, 1891).<ref>Nicholas Connell, Stewart Evans, ''[http://books.google.com.uy/books?id=tI7cLwEACAAJ&dq=nicholas+connell+stewart+evans&hl=es&sa=X&ei=nGVFUZGGBcHk4AOBi4DADA&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA The man who hunted Jack the Ripper: Edmund Reid, Victorian Detective]'', Editorial Amberley Publishing, Londres, Inglaterra (2009), p\u00e1g. 104.</ref> The journalist Joseph Hall Richardson of the ''Daily Telegraph'' reported on Sadler's identification attempt as guilt of the Ripper murders, in his memoir titled ''From the City to Fleet Street''.\n\nThere, he recounted that when Frances Coles was killed, his lover's guilt was taken for granted by the press \"too quickly\", but the detectives had doubts about it and used Richardson himself and another reporter. They were asked to make inquiries in the Chatham Harbor - when they had already arrested Sadler - in order to get information from his wife or concubine. Journalists interviewed the sailor's wife, whom Richardson described as a \"harpy that without measuring his words, betrayed the man\".\n\nThen, always following police instructions, the reporters conducted inquiries at the London Naval Trade Center and the Offices of the Ministry of Commerce, in order to verify whether or not at the time of the killings the sailor was on board. They examined records and checked the dates, and it was proven that each time there was a crime, the defendant \"signed\" on a vessel one or two days before the respective homicide.\n\nRichardson would eventually end up sympathizing and making friends with Sadler. He told the newspaper ''Star'' (an adversary of the newspaper he worked for) that he falsely accused the man, and that Sadler filed and won a lawsuit against the media. To celebrate the success, a toast with plenty of liquor was held in the offices of Richardson's newspaper. Sadler did not delay getting drunk, and when asked where he kept the money charged from the Star, he confided that it was kept under his cap. He was persuaded that it was better to keep the money inside the newspaper's safe for security reasons, to which he agreed. However, after a while, becoming more and more intoxicated, he became bellicose and demanded that his money be returned, claiming that he did not want to get scammed. On the next day, he went to his lawyer's office in order to give him the corresponding percentage of the received compensation. The curial at the time held a meeting with a person planning to smuggle arms into [[South America]], taking advantage of the fact that two republics were at war. When the merchant learned that his other client was a sailor, he offered him a position, to which the lawyer advised Sadler not to take, as it was a \"dangerous game\". Sadler ignored the prudent advice, and, addressing the merchant, announced: \"I will make you a sailor, boss.\" The next day, he left on the smuggler's ship bound for the Caribbean, this being the last true known fact about his whereabouts.<ref>Joseph Hall Richarson, ''[http://books.google.com.uy/books?id=pheOQgAACAAJ&dq=from+city+richardson+joseph+hall&hl=es&sa=X&ei=C2RFUbfEI7Oz4AOSkYCIAQ&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA From the City to Flett Street]'', editorial Paul Stanley, Londres, Inglaterra (1927), p\u00e1gs. 277-279.</ref><ref>Stewart Evans, Keith Skinner, ''[http://books.google.com.uy/books?id=7lBrAAAACAAJ&dq=cartas+evans+infierno&hl=es&sa=X&ei=0mZFUcx-qdvgA6ucgcgJ&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA Jack el Destripador: Cartas desde el Infierno]'', Ediciones Jaguar, Madrid, Espa\u00f1a (2003), p\u00e1gs. 217-219.</ref>\n\nDespite the above, modern studies registered that two people named James Sadler died in England, in 1906 and 1910.<ref name=\"sadler\">''[http://wiki.casebook.org/index.php/James_Sadler James Sadler]'' en el sitio digital ''[http://wiki.casebook.org/index.php/Main_Page wiki-casebook-org (Jack the Ripper - The Great Victorian Mystery)]''.</ref><ref>''[http://www.casebook.org/ripper_media/book_reviews/non-fiction/cjmorley/157.html Jack the Ripper, a suspect guide: Thomas James Sadler]''.</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Jack the Ripper suspects]]\n* [[Jack the Ripper]]\n* [[Jack the Ripper in fiction]]\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons|Jack the Ripper|Jack the Ripper}}\n* ''[http://wiki.casebook.org/index.php/James_Sadler Image of James Thomas Sadler: Illustration by ''Penny Illustrated Paper'', February 28, 1891]''.\n* \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20161021091356/http://jackeldestripador.net/ Jack el Destripador]\" (in Spanish, includes multimedia content).\n* [http://www.casebook.org/ James Thomas Sadler] on the digital site ''[http://www.casebook.org/index.html Casebook: Jack the Ripper]''.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sadler, James Thomas}}\n[[Category:1837 births]]\n[[Category:Year of death unknown]]\n[[Category:People acquitted of murder]]\n[[Category:Sailors from London]]\n[[Category:English smugglers]]\n[[Category:Jack the Ripper]]\n[[Category:People from Stepney]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|English sailor and murder suspect}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2019}}\n{{Infobox criminal\n| name = James Thomas Sadler\n| image_name = \n| image_caption = \n| birth_name = \n| birth_date = 1837\n| birth_place = [[Stepney]], [[London]], [[England]]\n| death_date = Unknown; possibly 1906 or 1910\n| death_place = [[England]] or [[South America]]\n| cause       = \n| conviction =  \n| conviction_penalty = \n| occupation = Sailor, stoker, machinist\n}}\n'''James Thomas Sadler''', also named '''Saddler''' in some sources,<ref>Colin Wilson, Robin Odell, ''[http://books.google.com.uy/books?id=lCVAAAAACAAJ&dq=recapitulacion+wilson+colin&hl=es&sa=X&ei=AmZFUfa4IcXh4AOdv4DoBw&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA Jack el Destripador: Recapitulaci\u00f3n y veredicto]'', Editorial Planeta, Barcelona, Espa\u00f1a (1989), p\u00e1g. 91.</ref> was an [[England|English]] merchant sailor who officiated interchangeably as a machinist and [[Stoker (occupation)|stoker]].

This information is contained in the report from the CID of [[Scotland Yard]], prepared on March 3, 1891 by inspector Henry Moore and Superintendent Thomas Arnold.<ref>''[http://www.casebook.org/police_officials/po-henry_moore.html Henry Moore (inspector jefe)]'', informaci\u00f3n subordinada a la p\u00e1gina ''[http://www.casebook.org/police_officials/ List of police who were involved in investigating the Whitechapel murders]''.</ref><ref>''[http://www.casebook.org/police_officials/po-arnld.html Thomas Arnold (superintendente)]'', informaci\u00f3n subordinada a la p\u00e1gina ''[http://www.casebook.org/police_officials/ List of police who were involved in investigating the Whitechapel murders]''.</ref> That report concluded by highlighting that after the exoneration of Sadler, there were no other prisoners charged with the killing of Frances Coles.<ref>Stewart Evans, Keith Skiner, ''[http://books.google.com.uy/books?id=8ISERAAACAAJ&dq=evans+skinner+ultimate&hl=es&sa=X&ei=L2ZFUf7uF7Gp4AOQvYC4AQ&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook]'', Editorial Constable and Robinson, Londres, Inglaterra (2001), p\u00e1gs. 627-628.</ref>\n\n== Press accusations ==\nOnce the defendant was released, the media could no longer proclaim that he was guilty, but they did not cease invoking Jack the Ripper. For example, ''The Spectator'' said: \"There is no doubt that no matter how long the suspicions are, Sadler did not kill the woman; and it is more than possible, probable, that the one who killed her was Jack the Ripper, the nickname that the people have given to the systematic assassin of Whitechapel prostitutes.\"<ref>Stewart Evans, Paul Gainey, ''[http://books.google.com.uy/books?id=iWKAWiI96sMC&dq=evans+gainey+first+killer&hl=es&sa=X&ei=ZGZFUcOVGLDh4APBz4Fg&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA Jack the Ripper: First American Serial Killer]'', Editorial Kodansha International, Londres, Inglaterra (1996), p\u00e1g. 156.</ref>\n\nIt was also speculated - more by journalists than detectives - that witnesses to the crimes would have identified the fireman. As claimed by the ''Daily Telegraph'', Joseph Lawende may have alluded to Sadler when he described the companion of [[Catherine Eddowes]] in Miter Square during the early hours of September 30, 1888. It was also alleged that he could've been the subject surprised by Israel Schwart prior to the murder of [[Elizabeth Stride]]. Nor it was ruled out that Chief Robert Anderson really accused him, and that he erroneously mentioned that the principal suspect was of [[Jews|Jewish]] origin.<ref>Paul Begg, ''[http://books.google.com.uy/books?id=q9PaAAAAMAAJ&q=paul+begg+history&dq=paul+begg+history&hl=es&sa=X&ei=iWZFUaSACrLB4APqwIHYCQ&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History]'', Editorial Pearson Education Ltd, Londres, Inglaterra (2005), p\u00e1gs. 341-342.</ref>\n\nThe reporters did not leave the sailor alone, even after release. He was constantly asked if he had participated in the other murders, to which he replied that he had been falsely accused and was never present at the crime scenes. According to each case, he was either embarked or in a distant place from where the deaths occurred (note edited by the ''East London Observer'' on March 28, 1891).<ref>Nicholas Connell, Stewart Evans, ''[http://books.google.com.uy/books?id=tI7cLwEACAAJ&dq=nicholas+connell+stewart+evans&hl=es&sa=X&ei=nGVFUZGGBcHk4AOBi4DADA&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA The man who hunted Jack the Ripper: Edmund Reid, Victorian Detective]'', Editorial Amberley Publishing, Londres, Inglaterra (2009), p\u00e1g. 104.</ref> The journalist Joseph Hall Richardson of the ''Daily Telegraph'' reported on Sadler's identification attempt as guilt of the Ripper murders, in his memoir titled ''From the City to Fleet Street''.\n\nThere, he recounted that when Frances Coles was killed, his lover's guilt was taken for granted by the press \"too quickly\", but the detectives had doubts about it and used Richardson himself and another reporter. They were asked to make inquiries in the Chatham Harbor - when they had already arrested Sadler - in order to get information from his wife or concubine. Journalists interviewed the sailor's wife, whom Richardson described as a \"harpy that without measuring his words, betrayed the man\".\n\nThen, always following police instructions, the reporters conducted inquiries at the London Naval Trade Center and the Offices of the Ministry of Commerce, in order to verify whether or not at the time of the killings the sailor was on board. They examined records and checked the dates, and it was proven that each time there was a crime, the defendant \"signed\" on a vessel one or two days before the respective homicide.\n\nRichardson would eventually end up sympathizing and making friends with Sadler. He told the newspaper ''Star'' (an adversary of the newspaper he worked for) that he falsely accused the man, and that Sadler filed and won a lawsuit against the media. To celebrate the success, a toast with plenty of liquor was held in the offices of Richardson's newspaper. Sadler did not delay getting drunk, and when asked where he kept the money charged from the Star, he confided that it was kept under his cap. He was persuaded that it was better to keep the money inside the newspaper's safe for security reasons, to which he agreed. However, after a while, becoming more and more intoxicated, he became bellicose and demanded that his money be returned, claiming that he did not want to get scammed. On the next day, he went to his lawyer's office in order to give him the corresponding percentage of the received compensation. The curial at the time held a meeting with a person planning to smuggle arms into [[South America]], taking advantage of the fact that two republics were at war. When the merchant learned that his other client was a sailor, he offered him a position, to which the lawyer advised Sadler not to take, as it was a \"dangerous game\". Sadler ignored the prudent advice, and, addressing the merchant, announced: \"I will make you a sailor, boss.\" The next day, he left on the smuggler's ship bound for the Caribbean, this being the last true known fact about his whereabouts.<ref>Joseph Hall Richarson, ''[http://books.google.com.uy/books?id=pheOQgAACAAJ&dq=from+city+richardson+joseph+hall&hl=es&sa=X&ei=C2RFUbfEI7Oz4AOSkYCIAQ&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA From the City to Flett Street]'', editorial Paul Stanley, Londres, Inglaterra (1927), p\u00e1gs. 277-279.</ref><ref>Stewart Evans, Keith Skinner, ''[http://books.google.com.uy/books?id=7lBrAAAACAAJ&dq=cartas+evans+infierno&hl=es&sa=X&ei=0mZFUcx-qdvgA6ucgcgJ&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA Jack el Destripador: Cartas desde el Infierno]'', Ediciones Jaguar, Madrid, Espa\u00f1a (2003), p\u00e1gs. 217-219.</ref>\n\nDespite the above, modern studies registered that two people named James Sadler died in England, in 1906 and 1910.<ref name=\"sadler\">''[http://wiki.casebook.org/index.php/James_Sadler James Sadler]'' en el sitio digital ''[http://wiki.casebook.org/index.php/Main_Page wiki-casebook-org (Jack the Ripper - The Great Victorian Mystery)]''.</ref><ref>''[http://www.casebook.org/ripper_media/book_reviews/non-fiction/cjmorley/157.html Jack the Ripper, a suspect guide: Thomas James Sadler]''.</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Jack the Ripper suspects]]\n* [[Jack the Ripper]]\n* [[Jack the Ripper in fiction]]\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons|Jack the Ripper|Jack the Ripper}}\n* ''[http://wiki.casebook.org/index.php/James_Sadler Image of James Thomas Sadler: Illustration by ''Penny Illustrated Paper'', February 28, 1891]''.\n* \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20161021091356/http://jackeldestripador.net/ Jack el Destripador]\" (in Spanish, includes multimedia content).\n* [http://www.casebook.org/ James Thomas Sadler] on the digital site ''[http://www.casebook.org/index.html Casebook: Jack the Ripper]''.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sadler, James Thomas}}\n[[Category:1837 births]]\n[[Category:Year of death unknown]]\n[[Category:People acquitted of murder]]\n[[Category:Sailors from London]]\n[[Category:English smugglers]]\n[[Category:Jack the Ripper]]\n[[Category:People from Stepney]]\n", "name_user": "Camblewick", "label": "safe", "comment": "Made a few changes to grammar but this whole article needs a re-wrtite", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Thomas_Sadler"}

It is located {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north of [[Seattle]] and is one of the main cities in the [[Seattle metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] and [[Puget Sound region]]. Everett is the [[List of cities and towns in Washington|seventh-largest]] city in Washington state and had a total population of 103,019 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is located at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]] along [[Port Gardner Bay]], an inlet of [[Possession Sound]] (itself part of [[Puget Sound]]).\n\nAmerican settlement on the Everett peninsula began in the 1860s, with several [[sawmill]]s built to serve the area's growing timber industry. Everett was [[plat]]ted by a group of investors seeking to build an industrial city and named for the son of co-founder Charles L. Colby. The city was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] in 1893, shortly after the arrival of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], and prospered as a major industrial center. Everett's economy transitioned away from lumber and towards aviation after [[World War II]], with the construction of [[Boeing]]'s [[Boeing Everett Factory|aircraft assembly plant]] at [[Paine Field]] in 1967. Boeing remains the city's largest employer, alongside the [[U.S. Navy]], which has operated [[Naval Station Everett]] since 1992. Everett received an [[All-America City Award]] in 2002.\n\nEverett remains a major employment center for Snohomish County, but has also become a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle in recent decades. It is connected to Seattle by [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] and various public transit services at [[Everett Station]], including the [[Sounder commuter rail|Sounder commuter train]], [[Amtrak]], and commuter buses.\n\n==History==\n[[File:everettwaterfront.jpg|thumb| [[Weyerhaeuser]] Lumber Mill, Everett Waterfront, c. early 1900s]]\n\nThe [[Port Gardner]] peninsula was originally inhabited by local [[Coast Salish]] tribes who arrived in the region 10,000 years [[before present]] and settled near modern-day Everett approximately 2,000 years [[before present]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}} The [[Snohomish people]] lived around local waterways in the [[Possession Sound]] estuary and had a fortified winter village at Hibulb (also called Hebolb) at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Whitely |first=Peyton |date=March 16, 2005 |title=Aerial photos show 2 very different cities |page=H8 |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/aerial-photos-show-2-very-different-cities/ |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first Europeans in the area were explorers from the 1792 [[Vancouver Expedition]], landing on a beach on the modern Everett waterfront on June 4 and claiming the land for [[England]] on the birthday of King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]].<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Federal Writers' Project]] |year=1941 |title=The WPA Guide to Washington: The Evergreen State |pages=186\u2013200 |series=[[American Guide Series]] |publisher=[[Works Progress Administration]] |oclc=881468746 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07PpCAAAQBAJ |via=Google Books |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> [[Puget Sound]] was further explored and charted ny the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in 1824 and the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] under [[Charles Wilkes]] in 1841, ahead of a larger American presence in the area.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=4}}<ref name=\"HistoryLink\">{{cite web |last=Oakley |first=Janet |date=July 26, 2005 |title=Everett \u2014 Thumbnail History |url=https://www.historylink.org/file/7397 |work=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Snohomish and other Coast Salish tribes signed the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] in 1855, which relinquished their lands to the [[Washington Territory|territorial government]] and established the nearby [[Tulalip Indian Reservation]], where they would be relocated.<ref name=\"Herald-125th\">{{cite news |last=Muhlstein |first=Julie |date=May 9, 2018 |title=City of Everett to celebrate 125th birthday with big party |url=https://www.heraldnet.com/news/city-of-everett-celebrates-125-years-and-counting/ |work=[[The Everett Herald]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first permanent American settler to arrive on the peninsula was Dennis Brigham, a carpenter from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], who claimed a {{convert|160|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} [[Homestead Acts|homestead]] and built a cabin for himself. He was joined by several other families on their own homesteads, which included the establishment of a general store and a [[sawmill]] that quickly went out of business.<ref name=\"HistoryLink\"/> Over the next several years a handful of loggers moved to the area, but plans for a settlement were not conceieved until 1890.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=7}}\n\nOn July 17, 1890, The steamship ''[[Queen of the Pacific]]'' left [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] for an Alaskan cruise with [[Henry Hewitt, Jr.]] and [[Charles L. Colby]] aboard. During this \"Fateful voyage\" initial plans for an industrial city on the peninsula along the banks of the Snohomish river were formulated. On August 22, 1890, The [[Rucker Brothers]] filed their [[plat]] at Port Gardner, a {{convert|50|acre|m2|adj=on}} townsite on the bayfront side of what is now the city of Everett. This plat was later withdrawn to accommodate the plans of the Hewitt-Colby group.\n\nOn September 1, 1890, Henry Hewitt filed a bond on the Davis tract at the north end of what was to become the Everett town site, beginning the process of acquisition that would become the Everett Land Company later along with Charles L. Colby and [[Colgate Hoyt]]. In October 1890, the Hewitt-Colby syndicate decided to name their industrial city after Everett Colby, the fifteen-year-old son of investor Charles L. Colby, who had displayed a prodigious appetite at dinner. Everett Colby in turn was named for orator [[Edward Everett]].\n\nOn November 19, 1890, the Articles of Incorporation for the Everett Land Company were filed, with Henry Hewitt Jr. as president. On November 26, 1890, the Rucker Brothers transferred {{convert|434.15|acre|km2}} of property on the Everett peninsula to Hewitt. Three days later, \"The Remarkable Document\" was drafted, setting the terms by which the Rucker Brothers would donate half their remaining holdings to Hewitt in exchange for promises of specific development.\n\nThe Company bought much of the Ruckers' land, taking them in as junior partners. Everett was officially incorporated on May 4, 1893, the year the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]] came to the town. Both Hewitt and the Ruckers had speculated that [[James J. Hill]] would make the town the terminus of his railroad. However Hill continued the railroad along the shore of [[Puget Sound]] to [[Seattle]]. Although it succeeded in building the city, the Everett Land Company was a failure for its investors. The outside investors withdrew, and the Company's holdings were transferred to a new company controlled by Hill. The Ruckers, who helped broker the deal, stayed in Everett and became leading citizens of the young city.\n\nRailroads and mines played a part in Everett's future. The mining community of [[Monte Cristo, Washington|Monte Cristo]] depended on a railway for supplies. It was hoped that the railroad would cross the mountains and bring in traffic. For a while ore was smelted in Everett, then sawmilling and port activity commenced. A dozen steam riverboats were built in Everett for the [[Klondike Gold Rush|Yukon gold rush]].\n\nSeveral survivors of the [[Bellingham riots]] settled in Everett for two months, until they were beaten and forcefully evicted by a mob on November 5, 1907. Everett also was the site of the [[Everett Massacre]] of 1916 in which a posse led by local Sheriff Donald McRae shot and killed five [[Industrial Workers of the World]] members. The IWW members on the [[Verona (steamship)|steamer ''Verona'']] travelled from Seattle to support strikers in Everett and sought to land, but McRae and his posse of deputized civilians blocked the harbor. Shooting broke out and at least five IWW members were killed, along with two in the posse who were deemed to have been killed by friendly fire.\n\nEverett streets are named after each of the three founders. Adjacent streets Colby Avenue and Hoyt Avenue run north and south and are intersected by Hewitt Avenue running east and west just south of the [[BNSF Railway]] tracks cutting across Everett. There are several other streets named for their associates such as Bond Street named for Judge [[Hiram Bond]], President of the Everett & Monte Cristo Railroad. Parallel to Colby and Hoyt are avenues named for other investors, [[John D. Rockefeller]], railroad executive [[Thomas Fletcher Oakes|T.F. Oakes]], shipbuilder [[Alexander McDougall (1845-1923)|Alexander McDougall]], and McDougall's associate [[Charles W. Wetmore]].\n\nDuring the [[Great Depression]], the [[Works Progress Administration]] was tasked with construction of several public works projects in the Everett area, including a new county airport that later became [[Paine Field]]. The airport was appropriated for military use during [[World War II]], but was later turned over to county ownership.<ref name=\"HistoryLink\"/> The [[Boeing Company]] selected a {{convert|780|acre|ha|adj=mid}} plot of land north of the airport in June 1966 to build a [[Boeing Everett Factory|new airplane factory]] for its [[Boeing 747]] passenger jetliner, which would become the world's first \"jumbo jet\".

It is located {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north of [[Seattle]] and is one of the main cities in the [[Seattle metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] and [[Puget Sound region]]. Everett is the [[List of cities and towns in Washington|seventh-largest]] city in Washington state and had a total population of 103,019 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is located at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]] along [[Port Gardner Bay]], an inlet of [[Possession Sound]] (itself part of [[Puget Sound]]).\n\nAmerican settlement on the Everett peninsula began in the 1860s, with several [[sawmill]]s built to serve the area's growing timber industry. Everett was [[plat]]ted by a group of investors seeking to build an industrial city and named for the son of co-founder Charles L. Colby. The city was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] in 1893, shortly after the arrival of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], and prospered as a major industrial center. Everett's economy transitioned away from lumber and towards aviation after [[World War II]], with the construction of [[Boeing]]'s [[Boeing Everett Factory|aircraft assembly plant]] at [[Paine Field]] in 1967. Boeing remains the city's largest employer, alongside the [[U.S. Navy]], which has operated [[Naval Station Everett]] since 1992. Everett received an [[All-America City Award]] in 2002.\n\nEverett remains a major employment center for Snohomish County, but has also become a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle in recent decades. It is connected to Seattle by [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] and various public transit services at [[Everett Station]], including the [[Sounder commuter rail|Sounder commuter train]], [[Amtrak]], and commuter buses.\n\n==History==\n[[File:everettwaterfront.jpg|thumb| [[Weyerhaeuser]] Lumber Mill, Everett Waterfront, c. early 1900s]]\n\nThe [[Port Gardner]] peninsula was originally inhabited by local [[Coast Salish]] tribes who arrived in the region 10,000 years [[before present]] and settled near modern-day Everett approximately 2,000 years [[before present]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}} The [[Snohomish people]] lived around local waterways in the [[Possession Sound]] estuary and had a permanent winter village at Hibulb (also called Hebolb) at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Whitely |first=Peyton |date=March 16, 2005 |title=Aerial photos show 2 very different cities |page=H8 |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/aerial-photos-show-2-very-different-cities/ |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The area was explored by the [[Vancouver Expedition]] of 1792, which landed on a beach on the modern Everett waterfront on June 4 and claimed the land for [[England]].<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Federal Writers' Project]] |year=1941 |title=The WPA Guide to Washington: The Evergreen State |pages=186\u2013200 |series=[[American Guide Series]] |publisher=[[Works Progress Administration]] |oclc=881468746 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07PpCAAAQBAJ |via=Google Books |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The Snohomish and other tribes signed the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] in 1855, relocating to the nearby [[Tulalip Indian Reservation]] and relinquishing its lands to the [[Washington Territory|territorial government]], opening the region to American settlement.<ref name=\"Herald-125th\">{{cite news |last=Muhlstein |first=Julie |date=May 9, 2018 |title=City of Everett to celebrate 125th birthday with big party |url=https://www.heraldnet.com/news/city-of-everett-celebrates-125-years-and-counting/ |work=[[The Everett Herald]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe first permanent American settler to arrive on the peninsula was Dennis Brigham, a carpenter from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], who claimed a {{convert|160|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} [[Homestead Acts|homestead]] on Port Gardner Bay in 1861 and built a cabin for himself. He was joined by several other families on their own homesteads, which included the establishment of a general store and a [[sawmill]] that quickly went out of business.<ref name=\"HistoryLink\">{{cite web |last=Oakley |first=Janet |date=July 26, 2005 |title=Everett \u2014 Thumbnail History |url=http://www.historylink.org/File/7397 |work=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> Over the next several years a handful of settlers moved to the area, but it wasn't until 1890 that plans for platting a town were conceived.\n\nOn July 17, 1890, The steamship ''[[Queen of the Pacific]]'' left [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] for an Alaskan cruise with [[Henry Hewitt, Jr.]] and [[Charles L. Colby]] aboard. During this \"Fateful voyage\" initial plans for an industrial city on the peninsula along the banks of the Snohomish river were formulated. On August 22, 1890, The [[Rucker Brothers]] filed their [[plat]] at Port Gardner, a {{convert|50|acre|m2|adj=on}} townsite on the bayfront side of what is now the city of Everett. This plat was later withdrawn to accommodate the plans of the Hewitt-Colby group.\n\nOn September 1, 1890, Henry Hewitt filed a bond on the Davis tract at the north end of what was to become the Everett town site, beginning the process of acquisition that would become the Everett Land Company later along with Charles L. Colby and [[Colgate Hoyt]]. In October 1890, the Hewitt-Colby syndicate decided to name their industrial city after Everett Colby, the fifteen-year-old son of investor Charles L. Colby, who had displayed a prodigious appetite at dinner. Everett Colby in turn was named for orator [[Edward Everett]].\n\nOn November 19, 1890, the Articles of Incorporation for the Everett Land Company were filed, with Henry Hewitt Jr. as president. On November 26, 1890, the Rucker Brothers transferred {{convert|434.15|acre|km2}} of property on the Everett peninsula to Hewitt. Three days later, \"The Remarkable Document\" was drafted, setting the terms by which the Rucker Brothers would donate half their remaining holdings to Hewitt in exchange for promises of specific development.\n\nThe Company bought much of the Ruckers' land, taking them in as junior partners. Everett was officially incorporated on May 4, 1893, the year the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]] came to the town. Both Hewitt and the Ruckers had speculated that [[James J. Hill]] would make the town the terminus of his railroad. However Hill continued the railroad along the shore of [[Puget Sound]] to [[Seattle]]. Although it succeeded in building the city, the Everett Land Company was a failure for its investors. The outside investors withdrew, and the Company's holdings were transferred to a new company controlled by Hill. The Ruckers, who helped broker the deal, stayed in Everett and became leading citizens of the young city.\n\nRailroads and mines played a part in Everett's future. The mining community of [[Monte Cristo, Washington|Monte Cristo]] depended on a railway for supplies. It was hoped that the railroad would cross the mountains and bring in traffic. For a while ore was smelted in Everett, then sawmilling and port activity commenced. A dozen steam riverboats were built in Everett for the [[Klondike Gold Rush|Yukon gold rush]].\n\nSeveral survivors of the [[Bellingham riots]] settled in Everett for two months, until they were beaten and forcefully evicted by a mob on November 5, 1907. Everett also was the site of the [[Everett Massacre]] of 1916 in which a posse led by local Sheriff Donald McRae shot and killed five [[Industrial Workers of the World]] members. The IWW members on the [[Verona (steamship)|steamer ''Verona'']] travelled from Seattle to support strikers in Everett and sought to land, but McRae and his posse of deputized civilians blocked the harbor. Shooting broke out and at least five IWW members were killed, along with two in the posse who were deemed to have been killed by friendly fire.\n\nEverett streets are named after each of the three founders. Adjacent streets Colby Avenue and Hoyt Avenue run north and south and are intersected by Hewitt Avenue running east and west just south of the [[BNSF Railway]] tracks cutting across Everett. There are several other streets named for their associates such as Bond Street named for Judge [[Hiram Bond]], President of the Everett & Monte Cristo Railroad. Parallel to Colby and Hoyt are avenues named for other investors, [[John D. Rockefeller]], railroad executive [[Thomas Fletcher Oakes|T.F. Oakes]], shipbuilder [[Alexander McDougall (1845-1923)|Alexander McDougall]], and McDougall's associate [[Charles W.
