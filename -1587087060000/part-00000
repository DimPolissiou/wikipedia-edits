The [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] runs between [[Newark Penn Station]] and [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|New York Penn Station]] (NYP). The project would build new rail bridges in the [[New Jersey Meadowlands]] and new tunnels under [[Bergen Hill]] ([[Hudson Palisades]]) and the [[North River (Hudson River)|Hudson River]], as well as the conversion of the [[James Farley Post Office]] into  Moynihan Train Hall and construction of a new [[Terminal station|terminal]] annex.\n\nThe existing two-track rail line used by both [[Amtrak]] and [[NJ Transit Rail Operations]] (NJT) has reached its full capacity of 24 trains per hour. Once completed, the improvements would double train capacity across the Hudson River to 48 trains per hour, allowing for additional [[High-speed rail in the United States|high-speed rail service]].<ref name=\"GPDC-Board-201701\"/> Gateway was unveiled in 2011, one year after New Jersey Governor [[Chris Christie]]'s cancellation of the somewhat similar [[Access to the Region's Core]] (ARC) project; it was originally projected to cost $14.5 billion and take 14 years to build.<ref name=\"NJAmtrak\"/> Some previously planned improvements already underway were incorporated into the Gateway program.

This will allow Amtrak and NJT to continue to use the [[East River Tunnels]] and [[Sunnyside Yards]] for staging, storage, and carrying Amtrak NEC trains.<ref name=\"GatewayPDF\" />\nThe Draft Environmental Impact Study (DEIS) for Gateway tunnels was issued in June 2017. Four alternatives for alignments under the Hudson River and the Palisades. Option 1 would have the new tunnels run close to the existing tunnels with a ventilation site near the Lincoln Tunnel Helix. This option would have required a construction staging site within the Lincoln Tunnel Helix, thus displacing New Jersey Transit's Weehawken bus storage site, which would have a negative impact on the operation of buses to the Port Authority Bus Terminal. Option 2 would have the new tunnels run further south than the first option, with a shaft site north of 19th Street near JFK Boulevard East. This option would require the acquisition and demolition of an existing multi-story office building to build the shaft site. The third option would be further south with a shaft site south of 19th Street. This option would preclude the development of a portion of a planned residential development under construction at 800 Harbor Boulevard. The fourth option would be further south with a shaft site south of 18th Street\u2013following the same horizontal alignment identified in the ARC FEIS. Alignment Option 4 was chosen for the build alternative even though it would have a slightly longer tunnel than in the other alternatives. Because of the additional length, there would be additional tunneling costs for this option. However, the first three options have greater pre-construction risks, meaning that if construction was delayed the cost difference would be minimized.

Penn Station operates at capacity during peak periods, and since it takes a long time for passengers to board and alight trains, trains cannot leave and enter the station as might otherwise be possible. Even with improvements in the station, there are inadequate train storage facilities at Penn, and there is no capacity in the East River Tunnels to allow for trains to be stored during middays at Sunnyside Yard.

This will allow Amtrak and NJT to continue to use the [[East River Tunnels]] and [[Sunnyside Yards]] for staging, storage, and carrying Amtrak NEC trains.<ref name=\"GatewayPDF\" />\nThe Draft Environmental Impact Study (DEIS) for Gateway tunnels was issued in June 2017. Four alternatives for alignments under the Hudson River and the Palisades. Option 1 would have the new tunnels run close to the existing tunnels with a ventilation site near the Lincoln Tunnel Helix. This option would have required a construction staging site within the Lincoln Tunnel Helix, thus displacing New Jersey Transit's Weehawken bus storage site, which would have a negative impact on the operation of buses to the Port Authority Bus Terminal. Option 2 would have the new tunnels run further south than the first option, with a shaft site north of 19th Street near JFK Boulevard East. This option would require the acquisition and demolition of an existing multi-story office building to build the shaft site. The third option would be further south with a shaft site south of 19th Street. This option would preclude the development of a portion of a planned residential development under construction at 800 Harbor Boulevard. The fourth option would be further south with a shaft site south of 18th Street\u2013following the same horizontal alignment identified in the ARC FEIS. Alignment Option 4 was chosen for the build alternative even though it would have a slightly longer tunnel than in the other alternatives. Because of the additional length, there would be additional tunneling costs for this option. However, the first three options have greater pre-construction risks, meaning that if construction was delayed the cost difference would be minimized.

Penn Station operates at capacity during peak periods, and since it takes a long time for passengers to board and alight trains, trains cannot leave and enter the station as might otherwise be possible. Even with improvements in the station, there are inadequate train storage facilities at Penn, and there is no capacity in the East River Tunnels to allow for trains to be stored during middays at Sunnyside Yard.

Florigen is produced in the [[leaf|leaves]], and acts in the [[shoot apical meristem]] of [[bud]]s and growing tips. It is known to be graft-transmissible, and even functions between species. However, despite having been sought since the 1930s, the exact nature of florigen is still disputed.\n\n==Mechanism ==\n\nCentral to the hunt for florigen is an understanding of how plants use seasonal changes in day length to mediate flowering\u2014a mechanism known as [[photoperiodism]]. Plants which exhibit photoperiodism may be either 'short day' or 'long day' plants, which in order to flower require short days or long days respectively, although plants in fact distinguish day length from night length.<ref name=\"Garner1920\">{{cite journal|author1=Garner W.W. |author2=Allard H.A. |year= 1920 |title=Effect of the relative length of day and night and other factors of the environment on growth and reproduction in plants |journal= Monthly Weather Review|volume=18 |pages=553\u2013606 |doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1920)48<415b:EOTRLO>2.0.CO;2| issue=7|bibcode=1920MWRv...48..415G |doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nThe current model suggests the involvement of multiple different factors.

Constant overexpression of GI from the ''Cauliflower mosaic virus'' 35S promoter causes early flowering under short day so an increase in GI mRNA expression induces flowering. Also, GI increases the expression of FT and CO mRNA, and FT and CO mutants showed later flowering time than GI mutant. In other words, functional FT and CO genes are required for flowering under short day. In addition, these flowering genes accumulate during light phase and decline during dark phase, which are measured by green fluorescent protein. Thus, their expressions oscillate during the 24-hour light-dark-cycle. In conclusion, the accumulation of GI mRNA alone or GI, FT, and CO mRNA promote flowering in ''Arabidopsis thaliana'' and these genes expressed in the temporal sequence GI-CO-FT.<ref name=\"Distinct roles of GIGANTEA\">{{Cite journal|last=Mizoguchi|first=Tsuyoshi|date=August 2005|title=Distinct Roles of GIGANTEA in Promoting Flowering and Regulating Circadian Rhythms in ''Arabidopsis''|journal=The Plant Cell|volume=17|issue=8|pages=2255\u20132270|doi=10.1105/tpc.105.033464|pmid=16006578|pmc=1182487}}</ref>\n\nAction potential triggers calcium flux into neurons in animal or root apex cells in plants.

Constant overexpression of GI from the ''Cauliflower mosaic virus'' 35S promoter causes early flowering under short day so an increase in GI mRNA expression induces flowering. Also, GI increases the expression of FT and CO mRNA, and FT and CO mutants showed later flowering time than GI mutant. In other words, functional FT and CO genes are required for flowering under short day. In addition, these flowering genes accumulate during light phase and decline during dark phase, which are measured by green fluorescent protein. Thus, their expressions oscillate during the 24-hour light-dark-cycle. In conclusion, the accumulation of GI mRNA alone or GI, FT, and CO mRNA promote flowering in ''Arabidopsis thaliana'' and these genes expressed in the temporal sequence GI-CO-FT.<ref name=\"Distinct roles of GIGANTEA\">{{Cite journal|last=Mizoguchi|first=Tsuyoshi|date=August 2005|title=Distinct Roles of GIGANTEA in Promoting Flowering and Regulating Circadian Rhythms in ''Arabidopsis''|journal=The Plant Cell|volume=17|issue=8|pages=2255\u20132270|doi=10.1105/tpc.105.033464|pmid=16006578|pmc=1182487}}</ref>\n\nAction potential triggers calcium flux into neurons in animal or root apex cells in plants.
