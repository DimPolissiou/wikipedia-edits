Like many [[federation|federal nations]], the [[constitution of India]] delegates the maintenance of law and order primarily to the [[States and union territories of India|states and territories]].\n\nAt the [[Government of India|federal]] level, some of India's [[Paramilitary forces of India|paramilitary forces]] are part of the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (India)|Ministry of Home Affairs]] and support the states. Larger cities have police forces under their respective state police. All senior officers in the state police forces and federal agencies are members of the [[Indian Police Service]] (IPS).{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n==Central agencies==\n[[File:The Union Home Minister, Shri Rajnath Singh presenting the medals and awards to CISF personnel, during the 49th Raising Day Parade of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), in Ghaziabad on March 10, 2018.jpg|alt=Two officers standing behind a machine gun|thumb|Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh presents medals and awards to CISF personnel and cadets.]]\nThe central agencies are controlled by the [[Government of India|central government]]. Most federal law-enforcement agencies are under the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (India)|Ministry of Home Affairs]]. The head of each agency is an IPS officer. The constitution assigns responsibility for maintaining law and order to the states and territories, and almost all routine policing\u2014including the apprehension of criminals\u2014is done by state-level police forces. The constitution also permits the central government to participate in police operations and organization by authorizing the creation of the Indian Police Service.\n[[File:National Police Museum New Delhi India.jpg|alt=Museum exhibit, with uniformed mannequins|thumb|upright=1.2|Exhibit of the [[Railway Protection Force]], [[Rapid Action Force]], [[National Security Guard]], and [[Intelligence Bureau (India)|Intelligence Bureau]] at the [[National Police Memorial (India)|National Police Memorial and Museum]] in [[New Delhi]].]]\nCentral police forces can assist a state's police force if requested by a state government. During the 1975-77 [[The Emergency (India)|Emergency]], the constitution was amended on 1 February 1976 to permit the central government to deploy its armed police forces without state permission. The amendment was unpopular, and use of the central police forces was controversial. After the Emergency was lifted, the constitution was again amended in December 1978 to restore the status quo.\n\n===Ministry of Home Affairs===\nThe principal national ministry concerned with law enforcement is the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), which supervises a large number of government functions and agencies operated and administered by the central government. The ministry is concerned with matters pertaining to the maintenance of public peace and order, the staffing and administration of the public services, delineation of internal boundaries, and the administration of [[Union territory|union territories]].\n\nIn addition to controlling the IPS, the Ministry of Home Affairs maintains several agencies and organizations dealing with police and security. Police in the union territories are under the MHA. The [[Minister of Home Affairs (India)|Minister of Home Affairs]] is the cabinet minister responsible for the ministry; the [[Home Secretary of India|Home Secretary]], an [[Indian Administrative Service]] (IAS) officer, is the ministry's administrative head.\n\n===Central Armed Police Forces===\n{{Main|Central Armed Police Forces}}\n====Border Security Force====\nThe [[Border Security Force]] (BSF) is responsible for policing India's land borders in peacetime and preventing trans-border crimes. A central police force under the Ministry of Home Affairs, its duties include VIP security, election supervision, guarding vital installations and [[Naxalite|counter-naxal]] operations.\n\nThe [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]], which highlighted the inadequacy of the existing border-management system, led to the formation of the Border Security Force as a unified central armed police force mandated with guarding India's boundary with [[Pakistan]]. The BSF's policing capability was used in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], against the [[Pakistani Armed Forces]], in areas which were the least threatened. During wartime or when ordered by the central government, the BSF is commanded by the [[Indian Army]]; BSF troops participated in the 1971 [[Battle of Longewala]] in this capacity. After the 1971 war (which led to the creation of [[Bangladesh]]), responsibility for policing the border with Bangladesh was assigned to the force.\n[[File:Indian BSF Soldier.jpg|alt=Two women conducting a ceremonial border retreat|thumb|Indian Border Security Officer in ceremonial uniform.]]\nOriginally charged with guarding India's external borders, the BSF has been tasked with [[counter-insurgency]] and [[counter-terrorism]] operations. When [[insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir]] broke out in 1989 and the [[Jammu and Kashmir]] state police and the thinly-deployed [[Central Reserve Police Force]] (CRPF) needed extra force to cope with spiraling violence, the central government deployed the BSF to Jammu and Kashmir to combat [[Islamic terrorism|Kashmiri militants]].\n\nBSF operates a Tear-Smoke Unit at its [[Police academy|academy]] in [[Gwalior]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], which supplies [[tear gas]] and [[Shell (projectile)#Smoke|smoke shells]] for riot prevention to all [[State police#India|state police]] forces. It operates [[Police dog|dog squads]], and runs the National Dog Training and Research Centre. The BSF, one of several Indian police forces which have its own [[Wing (military aviation unit)|air]] and water wings, provides helicopter, dog and other support services to the state police.\n\n====Central Industrial Security Force====\nThe [[Central Industrial Security Force]]'s (CISF) primary task is to provide industrial security.{{cn|date=July 2019}} It guards industrial installations nationwide which are owned by the central government, secures [[seaport]]s and [[airport]]s, and provides security for certain [[non-governmental organization]]s. The CISF provides security for nuclear-power plants, space installations, mints, oil fields and refineries, heavy-engineering and steel plants, [[Barrage (dam)|barrages]], fertilizer units, hydroelectric and [[thermal power station]]s, and other installations partially (or wholly) run by the government.{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\n====Central Reserve Police Force====\nThe [[Central Reserve Police Force|Central Reserve Police Force's]] (CRPF) main objective is to assist states and union territories' law-enforcement agencies in maintaining law and order and containing [[insurgency]]. It is deployed as an [[Counter-terrorism|anti-terrorist]] unit in several regions, and operates abroad as part of [[United Nations peacekeeping]] missions.{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\n====Indo-Tibetan Border Police====\nThe 90,000-member [[Indo-Tibetan Border Police]] (ITBP) is responsible for security along the {{convert|2115|km|adj=on}} Indo-[[Tibet]]an border and its surrounding areas. ITBP personnel are trained in maintaining law and order, military tactics, jungle warfare, counter-insurgency, and internal security.\n\n===={{anchor|National Security Guards}}National Security Guard====\nThe [[National Security Guard]] (NSG) is a [[commando]] unit originally created for counter-terrorism and hostage-rescue missions. Founded in 1986, it is popularly known as the \"Black Cats\" for its uniform. Like most military and elite-security units in India, it avoids the media and the Indian public is largely unaware of its capabilities and operational details.\n\nThe NSG draws its core members from the Indian Army, and the balance is support staff from other central police units. An NSG team and a transport aircraft is stationed at [[Indira Gandhi International Airport]] in New Delhi, ready to deploy in 30 minutes.\n\n===={{anchor|Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB)}}Sashastra Seema Bal====\n[[Sashastra Seema Bal]] (SSB), founded in 1963, is deployed at the Indo-[[Nepal]] and Indo-[[Bhutan]] borders. SSB, with over 82,000 personnel, is trained in maintaining law and order, military tactics, jungle warfare, counter-insurgency, and internal security. Its personnel are also deployed to the [[Intelligence Bureau (India)|Intelligence Bureau]] (IB), [[Research and Analysis Wing]] (R&AW), [[Special Protection Group]] (SPG), National Security Guard. Officers begin as an [[assistant commandant]] (equivalent to deputy superintendent of police on a state force), and retire with the rank of [[Inspector general#India|inspector general]] (IG).\n\n===Special Protection Group===\nThe [[Special Protection Group]] (SPG), the central government's [[executive protection]] agency, is responsible for the protection of the [[Prime Minister of India]] and their immediate family. The force was established in 1985, after the [[assassination of Indira Gandhi]]. It provides [[24/7 service|daily, round-the-clock]] security throughout India to the present Prime Minister and his family.\n\n===Central investigation and intelligence institutions===\n\n====Central Bureau of Investigation====\nThe [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] (CBI) is India's premier investigative agency, responsible for a wide variety of [[criminal]] and [[national security]] matters. Often cited as established with the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946, it was formed by the central government (which controls the Delhi police) with a resolution. Its constitutionality was questioned in the [[Gauhati High Court]] ''Narendra Kumar vs Union of India'' case on the basis that all areas of policing are exclusive to state governments, and the CBI is a central-government agency. The court ruled that despite the lack of legislation, the CBI is an authorized agency of the central government for national policing. Its ruling was upheld by the [[Supreme Court of India]], which cited the CBI's national importance.\n\nThe bureau is controlled by the Department of Personnel and Training in the [[Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions]] of the [[government of India]], usually headed by the [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] as the [[Minister of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions]]. India's [[Interpol]] unit, the CBI draws its personnel from IPS officers throughout the country. Specializing in crimes involving high-ranking government officials and politicians, the CBI has also accepted other criminal because of media and public pressure (usually due to local-police investigative incompetence).\n\n===={{anchor|Indian Income-tax Department}}Income Tax Department====\n{{Main|Directorate General of Income Tax Investigation|Investigation Division of the Central Board of Direct Taxes|Chief Commissioner of Income Tax Central}}\n[[File:ALH Dhruv, Indian Air Force.jpg|alt=Indian Navy helicopter, seen from below|thumb|Directorate General of Income Tax Investigation helicopters are supplied by the Indian Air Force.]]\nThe [[Income Tax Department]] (ITD) is India's premier financial agency, responsible for a wide variety of [[financial]] and [[fiscal policy|fiscal]] matters.

It provides input for policy and planning of [[Direct tax#Direct taxation in India|direct taxes]], and is responsible for the administration of direct-tax laws through the Income Tax Department. The CBDT operates in accordance with the Central Board of Revenue Act, 1963. The board members, in their ''[[Ex officio member|ex officio]]'' capacity, are also a division of the ministry dealing with matters relating to the levy and collection of taxes, tax evasion and revenue intelligence. It is India's official [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering]] (FATF) unit.

Some special agents and agents can carry firearms.<ref name=\"express\" />\n\nThe Directorate of Criminal Investigation (DCI) is headed by the Director General of Intelligence (Income Tax), which was created to address cross-border [[Black market|black money]].

Each state and union territory has a state police force (headed by a [[director general of police]], an Indian Police Service officer), which is responsible for maintaining law and order in the state's townships and rural areas.\n\n[[West Bengal]], [[Kerala]], [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Maharashtra]] have taken steps to train their police forces by advanced police-training schools such as [[Scotland Yard]], the [[Atlanta Police Department]] and the World Police Academy in [[Canada]]. The [[Tamil Nadu Police]] Academy is seeking university status, and the [[Kerala Police]] is South Asia's first police force to adopt [[community policing]].{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe Police Act of 1861 established the principles of organization for police forces in India and, with minor modifications, continues in effect. Although state police forces are separate and may differ in quality of equipment and resources, their patterns of organization and operation are similar.\n\nThe director (or inspector general) of police reports to the head of the home department of the state, generally an Indian Administrative Service officer at the rank of additional chief secretary or principal secretary to the state government. Under the inspector general are police ranges composed of three to six districts, headed by deputy inspectors general. District police headquarters are commanded by [[Superintendent of police (India)|superintendents of police]] (SP), who have discretionary powers and oversee subordinate police stations, criminal-investigation detachments, equipment storehouses and armories, and traffic police.\n\nMost preventive police work is carried out by constables assigned to police stations. Depending on the number of stations, a district may be subdivided and further divided into police circles to facilitate supervision by district headquarters. Most major metropolitan areas, such as Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai, have police commissionerates under the state police and headed by commissioners. Police in the states and [[Union territory|union territories]] are assisted by units of volunteer [[Home Guard (India)|Home Guards]] under guidelines formulated by the Ministry of Home Affairs.\n\nIn most states and territories, police forces are divided into civil (unarmed) police and armed contingents. Civil police staff police stations, conduct investigations, answer routine complaints, perform traffic duties, and patrol the streets. They usually carry [[Fighting stick|lathis]]: bamboo staffs, weighted (or tipped) with iron.\n[[File:Karnataka Police Tata Vehicle.JPG|alt=Two motorcycle police officers in front of a police car|thumb|Armed SWAT vehicle of the Karnataka Police]]\nArmed police are divided into two groups: district armed police and the [[Provincial Armed Constabulary]] (Pradeshik). District armed police are organized like an army infantry battalion. Assigned to police stations, they perform guard and escort duties. States which maintain armed contingents use them as an emergency reserve strike force. The units are organized as a mobile armed force under state control or, in the case of district armed police (who are not as well equipped), as a force directed by district superintendents and generally used for riot control.\n\nThe Provincial Armed Constabulary is an armed reserve maintained at key locations in some states and activated on orders from the deputy inspector general and higher-level authorities. Armed constabulary are not usually in contact with the public unless they are assigned to VIP duty or maintaining order during fairs, festivals, athletic events, elections, and natural disasters. They may be sent to quell outbreaks of student or labour unrest, organized crime, and communal riots; to maintain key guard posts, and to participate in anti-terrorism operations. Depending on the assignment, the Provincial Armed Constabulary may only carry lathis.\n\nSenior police officers answer to the police [[command hierarchy|chain of command]], and respond to the general direction of designated civilian officials. In the municipal force, the chain of command runs to the state home secretary rather than the district superintendent or district officials.\n\nWorking conditions and pay are poor, especially in the lower echelons. Recruits receive about {{INR}}9,000 per month (about US$150). Opportunities for promotion are limited because of the system of horizontal entry into higher grades.{{clarify|date=July 2019}} Allegations of bribery, attributable to low pay and poor working conditions, have been widespread.{{cn|date=July 2019}} A 2016 article on the Maharashtra state police describes why reform is needed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/news/Fixing-Mumbai-Free-the-police/article14494203.ece|title=Fixing Mumbai: Free the police|first=Vappala|last=Balachandran|date=17 July 2016|via=www.thehindu.com}}</ref>\n\nWomen have entered into the higher echelons of Indian police in greater numbers since the late 1980s, primarily through the Indian Police Service system. Female officers were first used in 1972, and a number of women hold key positions in state police organizations. Their absolute numbers, however, are small. Uniformed and undercover women police officers have been deployed in New Delhi as the Anti-Eve Teasing Squad, which combats the [[sexual harassment]] of women (\"Eves\").

Other DG rank officers head autonomous bodies not controlled by the DGP, such as the police recruitment board, fire service and police training. State forces are organised into zones, which consist of two (or more) ranges. Important zones are headed by an additional director general of police, and other zones are headed by an [[Inspector-general of police#India|inspector-general of police]] (IG). Ranges consist of several districts. Important ranges are headed by an IG, and other ranges are headed by a DIG.\n\nImportant districts are headed by a senior [[Superintendent of police (India)|superintendent of police]] (SSP), and other districts are headed by a superintendent of police (SP). If an SSP is heading the district, they are assisted by two (or more) SPs. If an SP is heading the district, they are generally assisted by one or two) SPs. Each district is divided into sub-divisions or circles, under a [[deputy superintendent of police]] (DSP). Each sub-division consists of several police stations commanded by an [[Inspector|inspector of police]], who is assisted by [[sub-inspector]]s (SIs) and [[Assistant sub-inspector of police|assistant sub-inspectors]] (ASIs). In rural areas, a sub-inspector is in charge of a police station; sub-inspectors (and higher) can file a charge sheet in court.\n\nDistrict SPs are not empowered as executive magistrates.

The [[Mahindra Legend]] Jeep had been the most common police car in India;  other SUVs, such as the [[Maruti Gypsy]], [[Mahindra Bolero]], [[Tata Sumo]], [[Tata Safari]], [[Chevrolet Tavera]] and [[Toyota Qualis]], are now used. SUVs are known for their capability in varied terrain.\n\n[[Minivan]]s are used by police in cities such as Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore, where the Chevrolet Tavera ([[Delhi]], [[Kochi]], [[Kozhikode]] and [[Thiruvananthapuram]]), Toyota Qualis ([[Mumbai]], [[Delhi]] and [[Chennai]]) and Maruti Suzuki Ertiga ([[Bangalore]] and Pune) are extensively used. Although most cities use SUVs and minivans, Chennai has adopted [[Sedan (automobile)|sedans]] such as the [[Hyundai Accent]]; [[Kolkata]] has adopted the [[Tata Indigo]]. In [[Kerala]] cities such as [[Thiruvananthapuram]], [[Kochi]] and [[Kozhikode]], the Pink Patrol (to protect women) uses the [[Toyota Etios]]. \n\nDepending upon the state, police vehicles may have revolving lights, strobes or light bars. A modernisation drive has ensured that vehicles are equipped with [[two-way radio]]s in communication with a central control room. Highway police vehicles generally have [[Speed limit enforcement|radar equipment]], [[Breathalyzer|breath analysers]] and emergency [[first aid kit]]s. For traffic regulation and city patrol, [[motorcycle]]s are also used; most were the Indian version of the [[Royal Enfield Bullet]], but the [[Bajaj Pulsar]] and [[TVS Apache]] are also used.\n\n== Weapons and equipment ==\nWeapons and equipment vary from state to state and agency to agency. Standard equipment for a [[constable]] on the [[Beat (police)|beat]] is the lathi, or baton\u2014generally made of [[bamboo]], but currently also made of [[polymer]]. Riot police have other equipment, including [[tear gas]] and [[taser]]s.\n\nAlthough police constables do not generally carry firearms on regular duty, they are available at police stations. Officers at and above the rank of [[sub-inspector]] or head constable are authorized to carry a [[Sidearm (weapon)|side arm]], generally a [[Pistol Auto 9mm 1A]] or a [[Glock 17]]. Officers always carry side arms. Traffic police officers have fine books and other equipment.\n\nFirearms previously stocked at police stations included [[Lee\u2013Enfield|.303 Lee\u2013Enfield]] rifles (now replaced), [[FN FAL|7.62 1A]] self-loading rifles and [[Sterling submachine gun|SAF Carbine 2A1s]], which have been replaced by [[AK-47]] and [[INSAS rifle]]s. The [[Ordnance Factory Board]] is a supplier of arms, ammunition, uniforms, bullet-proof vehicles, and mine-protected vehicles to the police. Only a station officer can allow the use of reserve guns in emergencies. During public unrest, protests or possible terrorist attacks, police are equipped by the state (or central) government.\n\nSpecial units at the state and federal level have automatic weapons, such as the AK-47, [[AKM]] and INSAS [[assault rifle]]s and [[Bren light machine gun|Bren guns]]. Special-forces and [[SWAT]] units use [[Heckler & Koch MP5]]s, [[Br\u00fcgger & Thomet MP9]]s, [[AK-103]]s, [[M4 carbine|M4A1 Carbine]]s and others. Bulletproof jackets are generally not worn by state police, although special units carry tactical vests, gear, and weapons according to function.\n\n<br />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Name\n!Weapon \n!Type\n!Caliber\n!Origin\n!Note\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" |[[Handgun|Handguns]]\n|-\n|[[Pistol Auto 9mm 1A]]\n|[[File:Pistol Auto 9 mm 1A - Kolkata 2012-01-23 8779.JPG|frameless|220x220px]]\n|[[Semi-automatic pistol]]\n|[[9mm Parabellum|9\u00d719mm Parabellum]]\n|India\n|Standard issue firearm\n|-\n|[[Glock 17]]\n|[[File:Glock 17.JPG|frameless|220x220px]]\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|[[Semi-automatic pistol]]\n|}\n|[[9mm Parabellum|9\u00d719mm Parabellum]]\n|Austria\n|Standard Issue Firearm\n|-\n|[[IOF .32 revolver]]\n|[[File:IOF-32-REV-1.JPG|frameless|220x220px]]\n|[[Revolver]]\n|7.65mm x 23mm\n|India\n|Standard issue firearm\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" |\n=== [[Shotgun]] ===\n|-\n|[[OFB pump action Shotgun]]\n|[[File:6--sa12pagun.jpg|frameless]]\n|[[Pump action]]\n|[[12-gauge shotgun]]\n|India\n|Used mostly by prison service and Forest Departments\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" |[[Submachine gun|Sub-Machine Gun]]\n|-\n![[Sterling submachine gun|SAF Carbine 2A1]]\n![[File:Sterling SMG.JPG|frameless|220x220px]]\n![[Submachine gun]]\n![[9mm Parabellum|9\u00d719mm Parabellum]]\n!India\n!Used by armed police and reserve police\n|-\n![[Heckler & Koch MP5]]\n![[File:Heckler & Koch MP5 b.jpg|frameless|220x220px]]\n![[Submachine gun]]\n![[9mm Parabellum|9\u00d719mm Parabellum]]\n!India\n!Used mainly by Police SWAT \n|-\n![[Sten|Sten Sub Machine]]\n![[File:Sten Mk II IMG 4781 (Nemo5576) noBG.png|frameless|220x220px]]\n![[Submachine gun]]\n![[9mm Parabellum|9\u00d719mm Parabellum]]\n!UK\n!Being phased out\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" |Assault Rifle/ Battle Rifles\n|-\n![[Ishapore 2A1 rifle]]\n![[File:RFI Rifle 7.62mm 2A1.JPG|frameless|220x220px]]\n![[Bolt action|bolt-action]]\n![[.303 British|.303 Mk VII SAA Ball]]\n!India\n!Being phased out, mainly retain for ceremonial purpose, still  employed by Forest Departments\n|-\n!315\" SPORTING RIFLE\n![[File:315 Sporting rifle.png|frameless]]\n![[Bolt action|bolt-action]]\n!8 mm (.315\")\n!India\n!Mainly employed by Forest Departments\n|-\n!12 Bore Double barrel shotgun\n![[File:ShotgunAction.JPG|frameless]]\n!Single shot\n!12-gauge\n!India\n!Mainly employed by Forest Deparments\n|-\n![[L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle]]\n![[File:SLRL1A1.jpg|frameless|220x220px]]\n![[Semi-automatic rifle]]\n![[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]]\n!India\n!Being phased out\n|-\n![[AKM]]\n![[File:AKM automatkarbin Ryssland - 7,62x39mm - Arm\u00e9museum rightside noBG.png|frameless|220x220px]]\n![[Assault rifle|Assault  Rifle]]\n![[7.62\u00d739mm]]\n!Bulgaria\n!\n|-\n![[INSAS|1B1 INSAS]]\n![[File:INSAS Standard Issue Assualt Rifle noBG.png|frameless|220x220px]]\n![[Assault rifle|Assault  Rifle]]\n![[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]]\n!India\n!Mainstay of police force\n|-\n![[Colt M4]]\n![[File:Colt LE694CK M4A1 Monolithic Carbine 11.5 inch.jpg|frameless]]\n!Assault rifle\n![[5.56 NATO]]\n!USA\n!Used by Mizoram Police\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" |Light Machine Gun\n|-\n![[Bren light machine gun|GUN MACHINE 7.62MM IA]]\n![[File:Bren wog.jpg|frameless|220x220px]]\n![[Light machine gun|Light machine Gun]]\n![[7.62\u00d751mm NATO|7.62 x 51 mm NATO]]\n!India\n!Being phased out\n|-\n!INSAS LMG\n![[File:INSAS LMG.JPG|frameless|220x220px]]\n![[Light machine gun|Light machine Gun]]\n![[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]]\n!India\n!\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" |Sniper Rifles\n|-\n![[M107 Long Range Sniper Rifle|M107]]\n![[File:M107 html 5f1f60d5.gif|frameless]]\n![[Sniper rifle|Sniper Rifle]]\n![[.416 Barrett|416 Barrett]]\n!USA\n!used by Mumbai Police's Force One  Commandos\n|}\n\n=={{anchor|Mukhbir informers network|Mukhbir|Mukhbirs|Informers network|Informers}}''Mukhbir''==\n{{anchor | Mukhbir informers network | Mukhbir }}\n{{Main|Police Mitra scheme}}\nInformers (''mukhbir'') provide information for financial compensation.

Like many [[federation|federal nations]], the [[constitution of India]] delegates the maintenance of law and order primarily to the [[States and union territories of India|states and territories]].\n\nAt the [[Government of India|federal]] level, some of India's [[Paramilitary forces of India|paramilitary forces]] are part of the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (India)|Ministry of Home Affairs]] and support the states. Larger cities have police forces under their respective state police. All senior officers in the state police forces and federal agencies are members of the [[Indian Police Service]] (IPS).{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n==Central agencies==\n[[File:The Union Home Minister, Shri Rajnath Singh presenting the medals and awards to CISF personnel, during the 49th Raising Day Parade of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), in Ghaziabad on March 10, 2018.jpg|alt=Two officers standing behind a machine gun|thumb|Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh presents medals and awards to CISF personnel and cadets.]]\nThe central agencies are controlled by the [[Government of India|central government]]. Most federal law-enforcement agencies are under the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (India)|Ministry of Home Affairs]]. The head of each agency is an IPS officer. The constitution assigns responsibility for maintaining law and order to the states and territories, and almost all routine policing\u2014including the apprehension of criminals\u2014is done by state-level police forces. The constitution also permits the central government to participate in police operations and organization by authorizing the creation of the Indian Police Service.\n[[File:National Police Museum New Delhi India.jpg|alt=Museum exhibit, with uniformed mannequins|thumb|upright=1.2|Exhibit of the [[Railway Protection Force]], [[Rapid Action Force]], [[National Security Guard]], and [[Intelligence Bureau (India)|Intelligence Bureau]] at the [[National Police Memorial (India)|National Police Memorial and Museum]] in [[New Delhi]].]]\nCentral police forces can assist a state's police force if requested by a state government. During the 1975-77 [[The Emergency (India)|Emergency]], the constitution was amended on 1 February 1976 to permit the central government to deploy its armed police forces without state permission. The amendment was unpopular, and use of the central police forces was controversial. After the Emergency was lifted, the constitution was again amended in December 1978 to restore the status quo.\n\n===Ministry of Home Affairs===\nThe principal national ministry concerned with law enforcement is the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), which supervises a large number of government functions and agencies operated and administered by the central government. The ministry is concerned with matters pertaining to the maintenance of public peace and order, the staffing and administration of the public services, delineation of internal boundaries, and the administration of [[Union territory|union territories]].\n\nIn addition to controlling the IPS, the Ministry of Home Affairs maintains several agencies and organizations dealing with police and security. Police in the union territories are under the MHA. The [[Minister of Home Affairs (India)|Minister of Home Affairs]] is the cabinet minister responsible for the ministry; the [[Home Secretary of India|Home Secretary]], an [[Indian Administrative Service]] (IAS) officer, is the ministry's administrative head.\n\n===Central Armed Police Forces===\n{{Main|Central Armed Police Forces}}\n====Border Security Force====\nThe [[Border Security Force]] (BSF) is responsible for policing India's land borders in peacetime and preventing trans-border crimes. A central police force under the Ministry of Home Affairs, its duties include VIP security, election supervision, guarding vital installations and [[Naxalite|counter-naxal]] operations.\n\nThe [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]], which highlighted the inadequacy of the existing border-management system, led to the formation of the Border Security Force as a unified central armed police force mandated with guarding India's boundary with [[Pakistan]]. The BSF's policing capability was used in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], against the [[Pakistani Armed Forces]], in areas which were the least threatened. During wartime or when ordered by the central government, the BSF is commanded by the [[Indian Army]]; BSF troops participated in the 1971 [[Battle of Longewala]] in this capacity. After the 1971 war (which led to the creation of [[Bangladesh]]), responsibility for policing the border with Bangladesh was assigned to the force.\n[[File:Indian BSF Soldier.jpg|alt=Two women conducting a ceremonial border retreat|thumb|Indian Border Security Officer in ceremonial uniform.]]\nOriginally charged with guarding India's external borders, the BSF has been tasked with [[counter-insurgency]] and [[counter-terrorism]] operations. When [[insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir]] broke out in 1989 and the [[Jammu and Kashmir]] state police and the thinly-deployed [[Central Reserve Police Force]] (CRPF) needed extra force to cope with spiraling violence, the central government deployed the BSF to Jammu and Kashmir to combat [[Islamic terrorism|Kashmiri militants]].\n\nBSF operates a Tear-Smoke Unit at its [[Police academy|academy]] in [[Gwalior]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], which supplies [[tear gas]] and [[Shell (projectile)#Smoke|smoke shells]] for riot prevention to all [[State police#India|state police]] forces. It operates [[Police dog|dog squads]], and runs the National Dog Training and Research Centre. The BSF, one of several Indian police forces which have its own [[Wing (military aviation unit)|air]] and water wings, provides helicopter, dog and other support services to the state police.\n\n====Central Industrial Security Force====\nThe [[Central Industrial Security Force]]'s (CISF) primary task is to provide industrial security.{{cn|date=July 2019}} It guards industrial installations nationwide which are owned by the central government, secures [[seaport]]s and [[airport]]s, and provides security for certain [[non-governmental organization]]s. The CISF provides security for nuclear-power plants, space installations, mints, oil fields and refineries, heavy-engineering and steel plants, [[Barrage (dam)|barrages]], fertilizer units, hydroelectric and [[thermal power station]]s, and other installations partially (or wholly) run by the government.{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\n====Central Reserve Police Force====\nThe [[Central Reserve Police Force|Central Reserve Police Force's]] (CRPF) main objective is to assist states and union territories' law-enforcement agencies in maintaining law and order and containing [[insurgency]]. It is deployed as an [[Counter-terrorism|anti-terrorist]] unit in several regions, and operates abroad as part of [[United Nations peacekeeping]] missions.{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\n====Indo-Tibetan Border Police====\nThe 90,000-member [[Indo-Tibetan Border Police]] (ITBP) is responsible for security along the {{convert|2115|km|adj=on}} Indo-[[Tibet]]an border and its surrounding areas. ITBP personnel are trained in maintaining law and order, military tactics, jungle warfare, counter-insurgency, and internal security.\n\n===={{anchor|National Security Guards}}National Security Guard====\nThe [[National Security Guard]] (NSG) is a [[commando]] unit originally created for counter-terrorism and hostage-rescue missions. Founded in 1986, it is popularly known as the \"Black Cats\" for its uniform. Like most military and elite-security units in India, it avoids the media and the Indian public is largely unaware of its capabilities and operational details.\n\nThe NSG draws its core members from the Indian Army, and the balance is support staff from other central police units. An NSG team and a transport aircraft is stationed at [[Indira Gandhi International Airport]] in New Delhi, ready to deploy in 30 minutes.\n\n===={{anchor|Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB)}}Sashastra Seema Bal====\n[[Sashastra Seema Bal]] (SSB), founded in 1963, is deployed at the Indo-[[Nepal]] and Indo-[[Bhutan]] borders. SSB, with over 82,000 personnel, is trained in maintaining law and order, military tactics, jungle warfare, counter-insurgency, and internal security. Its personnel are also deployed to the [[Intelligence Bureau (India)|Intelligence Bureau]] (IB), [[Research and Analysis Wing]] (R&AW), [[Special Protection Group]] (SPG), National Security Guard. Officers begin as an [[assistant commandant]] (equivalent to deputy superintendent of police on a state force), and retire with the rank of [[Inspector general#India|inspector general]] (IG).\n\n===Special Protection Group===\nThe [[Special Protection Group]] (SPG), the central government's [[executive protection]] agency, is responsible for the protection of the [[Prime Minister of India]] and their immediate family. The force was established in 1985, after the [[assassination of Indira Gandhi]]. It provides [[24/7 service|daily, round-the-clock]] security throughout India to the present Prime Minister and his family.\n\n===Central investigation and intelligence institutions===\n\n====Central Bureau of Investigation====\nThe [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] (CBI) is India's premier investigative agency, responsible for a wide variety of [[criminal]] and [[national security]] matters. Often cited as established with the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946, it was formed by the central government (which controls the Delhi police) with a resolution. Its constitutionality was questioned in the [[Gauhati High Court]] ''Narendra Kumar vs Union of India'' case on the basis that all areas of policing are exclusive to state governments, and the CBI is a central-government agency. The court ruled that despite the lack of legislation, the CBI is an authorized agency of the central government for national policing. Its ruling was upheld by the [[Supreme Court of India]], which cited the CBI's national importance.\n\nThe bureau is controlled by the Department of Personnel and Training in the [[Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions]] of the [[government of India]], usually headed by the [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] as the [[Minister of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions]]. India's [[Interpol]] unit, the CBI draws its personnel from IPS officers throughout the country. Specializing in crimes involving high-ranking government officials and politicians, the CBI has also accepted other criminal because of media and public pressure (usually due to local-police investigative incompetence).\n\n===={{anchor|Indian Income-tax Department}}Income Tax Department====\n{{Main|Directorate General of Income Tax Investigation|Investigation Division of the Central Board of Direct Taxes|Chief Commissioner of Income Tax Central}}\n[[File:ALH Dhruv, Indian Air Force.jpg|alt=Indian Navy helicopter, seen from below|thumb|Directorate General of Income Tax Investigation helicopters are supplied by the Indian Air Force.]]\nThe [[Income Tax Department]] (ITD) is India's premier financial agency, responsible for a wide variety of [[financial]] and [[fiscal policy|fiscal]] matters. The department is controlled by the Department of Revenue in the [[Ministry of Finance (India)|Ministry of Finance]], headed by a [[Union Council of Ministers|minister]] who reports directly to the prime minister. The [[Taxation in India|Central Board of Direct Taxes]] (CBDT) is also part of the Department of Revenue. It provides input for policy and planning of [[Direct tax#Direct taxation in India|direct taxes]], and is responsible for the administration of direct-tax laws through the Income Tax Department. The CBDT operates in accordance with the Central Board of Revenue Act, 1963. The board members, in their ''[[Ex officio member|ex officio]]'' capacity, are also a division of the ministry dealing with matters relating to the levy and collection of taxes, tax evasion and revenue intelligence. It is India's official [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering]] (FATF) unit.

Each state and union territory has a state police force (headed by a [[director general of police]], an Indian Police Service officer), which is responsible for maintaining law and order in the state's townships and rural areas.\n\n[[West Bengal]], [[Kerala]], [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Maharashtra]] have taken steps to train their police forces by advanced police-training schools such as [[Scotland Yard]], the [[Atlanta Police Department]] and the World Police Academy in [[Canada]]. The [[Tamil Nadu Police]] Academy is seeking university status, and the [[Kerala Police]] is South Asia's first police force to adopt [[community policing]].{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe Police Act of 1861 established the principles of organization for police forces in India and, with minor modifications, continues in effect. Although state police forces are separate and may differ in quality of equipment and resources, their patterns of organization and operation are similar.\n\nThe director (or inspector general) of police reports to the head of the home department of the state, generally an Indian Administrative Service officer at the rank of additional chief secretary or principal secretary to the state government. Under the inspector general are police ranges composed of three to six districts, headed by deputy inspectors general. District police headquarters are commanded by [[Superintendent of police (India)|superintendents of police]] (SP), who have discretionary powers and oversee subordinate police stations, criminal-investigation detachments, equipment storehouses and armories, and traffic police.\n\nMost preventive police work is carried out by constables assigned to police stations. Depending on the number of stations, a district may be subdivided and further divided into police circles to facilitate supervision by district headquarters. Most major metropolitan areas, such as Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai, have police commissionerates under the state police and headed by commissioners. Police in the states and [[Union territory|union territories]] are assisted by units of volunteer [[Home Guard (India)|Home Guards]] under guidelines formulated by the Ministry of Home Affairs.\n\nIn most states and territories, police forces are divided into civil (unarmed) police and armed contingents. Civil police staff police stations, conduct investigations, answer routine complaints, perform traffic duties, and patrol the streets. They usually carry [[Fighting stick|lathis]]: bamboo staffs, weighted (or tipped) with iron.\n[[File:Karnataka Police Tata Vehicle.JPG|alt=Two motorcycle police officers in front of a police car|thumb|Armed SWAT vehicle of the Karnataka Police]]\nArmed police are divided into two groups: district armed police and the [[Provincial Armed Constabulary]] (Pradeshik). District armed police are organized like an army infantry battalion. Assigned to police stations, they perform guard and escort duties. States which maintain armed contingents use them as an emergency reserve strike force. The units are organized as a mobile armed force under state control or, in the case of district armed police (who are not as well equipped), as a force directed by district superintendents and generally used for riot control.\n\nThe Provincial Armed Constabulary is an armed reserve maintained at key locations in some states and activated on orders from the deputy inspector general and higher-level authorities. Armed constabulary are not usually in contact with the public unless they are assigned to VIP duty or maintaining order during fairs, festivals, athletic events, elections, and natural disasters. They may be sent to quell outbreaks of student or labour unrest, organized crime, and communal riots; to maintain key guard posts, and to participate in anti-terrorism operations. Depending on the assignment, the Provincial Armed Constabulary may only carry lathis.\n\nSenior police officers answer to the police [[command hierarchy|chain of command]], and respond to the general direction of designated civilian officials. In the municipal force, the chain of command runs to the state home secretary rather than the district superintendent or district officials.\n\nWorking conditions and pay are poor, especially in the lower echelons. Recruits receive about {{INR}}9,000 per month (about US$150). Opportunities for promotion are limited because of the system of horizontal entry into higher grades.{{clarify|date=July 2019}} Allegations of bribery, attributable to low pay and poor working conditions, have been widespread.{{cn|date=July 2019}} A 2016 article on the Maharashtra state police describes why reform is needed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/news/Fixing-Mumbai-Free-the-police/article14494203.ece|title=Fixing Mumbai: Free the police|first=Vappala|last=Balachandran|date=17 July 2016|via=www.thehindu.com}}</ref>\n\nWomen have entered into the higher echelons of Indian police in greater numbers since the late 1980s, primarily through the Indian Police Service system. Female officers were first used in 1972, and a number of women hold key positions in state police organizations. Their absolute numbers, however, are small. Uniformed and undercover women police officers have been deployed in New Delhi as the Anti-Eve Teasing Squad, which combats the [[sexual harassment]] of women (\"Eves\"). Several women-only police stations have been established in Tamil Nadu to handle sex crimes against women. \n\n===Uniforms===\n[[File:Ranks of Police National Police Museum New Delhi India.jpg|thumb|alt=Mannequins in khaki uniforms|Exhibit of Indian police ranks and uniforms at the [[National Police Memorial (India)|National Police Memorial and Museum]], New Delhi]]\nUniforms of state and local police vary by grade, region, and type of duty. The main service uniform for state police is khaki. Some cities, such as [[Kolkata]], have white uniforms.

Other DG rank officers head autonomous bodies not controlled by the DGP, such as the police recruitment board, fire service and police training. State forces are organised into zones, which consist of two (or more) ranges. Important zones are headed by an additional director general of police, and other zones are headed by an [[Inspector-general of police#India|inspector-general of police]] (IG). Ranges consist of several districts. Important ranges are headed by an IG, and other ranges are headed by a DIG.\n\nImportant districts are headed by a senior [[Superintendent of police (India)|superintendent of police]] (SSP), and other districts are headed by a superintendent of police (SP). If an SSP is heading the district, they are assisted by two (or more) SPs. If an SP is heading the district, they are generally assisted by one or two) SPs. Each district is divided into sub-divisions or circles, under a [[deputy superintendent of police]] (DSP). Each sub-division consists of several police stations commanded by an [[Inspector|inspector of police]], who is assisted by [[sub-inspector]]s (SIs) and [[Assistant sub-inspector of police|assistant sub-inspectors]] (ASIs). In rural areas, a sub-inspector is in charge of a police station; sub-inspectors (and higher) can file a charge sheet in court.\n\nDistrict SPs are not empowered as executive magistrates. The [[District magistrate (India)|district magistrate]] (DM, an IAS officer) exercises these powers, which include promulgating Section 144 of the [[Code of Criminal Procedure (India)|Code of Criminal Procedure]] (CrPC) and issuing arms licenses.\n\n==={{anchor|Criminal Investigation Department}}Criminal investigation department===\nA [[Criminal investigation department#India|criminal investigation department]] (CID) is constituted in each district under a deputy inspector general to collect and distribute information about organized crime.{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\n===Police commissionerates===\n[[File:India - Kolkata traffic cop - 3661.jpg|alt=Two mounted-police officers|thumb|Traffic Police directing cars in Kolkata.]]\nSome cities use the police commissionerate system (like [[Kolkata Police Force|Kolkata]], [[Bidhannagar Police Commissionerate]], [[Mumbai Police|Mumbai]], [[Delhi Police|Delhi]] ,[[Pune Police|Pune]] etc.), headed by a [[Police commissioner#India|police commissioner]].Demand for this system is increasing as it gives police a free hand to act freely and take control of any situation.71 large cities and suburban areas currently have this system.Even in British Raj, the presidency towns of [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], [[Mumbai|Bombay]] and [[Chennai|Madras]] had commissionerate system.Reporting to the Police Commissioner(CP) are the Joint Police Commissioner(Joint CPs), Deputy Commissioner of Police(DCPs) and Assistant Commissioner of Police(ACPs).Commissioners of police and their deputies are empowered as executive magistrates to enforce [[Unlawful assembly#India|Section 144 of the CrPC]] and issue arms licenses. Police commissionerates are subordinate to the state police except for the [[Kolkata Police Force]], which independently reports to the [[Department of Home (West Bengal)|Department of Home]] of [[Government of West Bengal]].\n\n===Traffic police===\nHighway and traffic police in small towns are under the state police; traffic police in cities are under the metropolitan and state police.

Educational requirements increase for higher posts.\n\nAssistant superintendents of police (ASP) are recruited annually by the independent [[Union Public Service Commission]] by competitive examination, and are appointed to the Indian Police Service. The IPS officers are then assigned to a state force. Trainee officers undergo 44 weeks of initial training, which includes invited lawyers and management consultants. At the end of their probation, they have several weeks of orientation at the state police academy.\n\nNon-managerial positions are selected by the state (or central) government, and are trained at police recruit schools. The length of training for inspectors is about a year; for constables, it is nearly nine months. School training staff is drawn from the police force. Police are trained in basic law, self-protection, weapons handling and other skills at recruit stations. Superior recruits receive special training.\n\nRecruitment for state police is conducted by state police recruitment boards.

The [[Mahindra Legend]] Jeep had been the most common police car in India;  other SUVs, such as the [[Maruti Gypsy]], [[Mahindra Bolero]], [[Tata Sumo]], [[Tata Safari]], [[Chevrolet Tavera]] and [[Toyota Qualis]], are now used. SUVs are known for their capability in varied terrain.\n\n[[Minivan]]s are used by police in cities such as Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore, where the Chevrolet Tavera ([[Delhi]], [[Kochi]], [[Kozhikode]] and [[Thiruvananthapuram]]), Toyota Qualis ([[Mumbai]], [[Delhi]] and [[Chennai]]) and Maruti Suzuki Ertiga ([[Bangalore]] and Pune) are extensively used. Although most cities use SUVs and minivans, Chennai has adopted [[Sedan (automobile)|sedans]] such as the [[Hyundai Accent]]; [[Kolkata]] has adopted the [[Tata Indigo]]. In [[Kerala]] cities such as [[Thiruvananthapuram]], [[Kochi]] and [[Kozhikode]], the Pink Patrol (to protect women) uses the [[Toyota Etios]]. \n\nDepending upon the state, police vehicles may have revolving lights, strobes or light bars. A modernisation drive has ensured that vehicles are equipped with [[two-way radio]]s in communication with a central control room. Highway police vehicles generally have [[Speed limit enforcement|radar equipment]], [[Breathalyzer|breath analysers]] and emergency [[first aid kit]]s. For traffic regulation and city patrol, [[motorcycle]]s are also used; most were the Indian version of the [[Royal Enfield Bullet]], but the [[Bajaj Pulsar]] and [[TVS Apache]] are also used.\n\n== Weapons and equipment ==\nWeapons and equipment vary from state to state and agency to agency. Standard equipment for a [[constable]] on the [[Beat (police)|beat]] is the lathi, or baton\u2014generally made of [[bamboo]], but currently also made of [[polymer]]. Riot police have other equipment, including [[tear gas]] and [[taser]]s.\n\nAlthough police constables do not generally carry firearms on regular duty, they are available at police stations. Officers at and above the rank of [[sub-inspector]] or head constable are authorized to carry a [[Sidearm (weapon)|side arm]], generally a [[Pistol Auto 9mm 1A]] or a [[Glock 17]]. Officers always carry side arms. Traffic police officers have fine books and other equipment.\n\nFirearms previously stocked at police stations included [[Lee\u2013Enfield|.303 Lee\u2013Enfield]] rifles (now replaced), [[FN FAL|7.62 1A]] self-loading rifles and [[Sterling submachine gun|SAF Carbine 2A1s]], which have been replaced by [[AK-47]] and [[INSAS rifle]]s. The [[Ordnance Factory Board]] is a supplier of arms, ammunition, uniforms, bullet-proof vehicles, and mine-protected vehicles to the police. Only a station officer can allow the use of reserve guns in emergencies. During public unrest, protests or possible terrorist attacks, police are equipped by the state (or central) government.\n\nSpecial units at the state and federal level have automatic weapons, such as the AK-47, [[AKM]] and INSAS [[assault rifle]]s and [[Bren light machine gun|Bren guns]]. Special-forces and [[SWAT]] units use [[Heckler & Koch MP5]]s, [[Br\u00fcgger & Thomet MP9]]s, [[AK-103]]s, [[M4 carbine|M4A1 Carbine]]s and others. Bulletproof jackets are generally not worn by state police, although special units carry tactical vests, gear, and weapons according to function.\n\n<br />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Name\n!Weapon \n!Type\n!Caliber\n!Origin\n!Note\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" |[[Handgun|Handguns]]\n|-\n|[[Pistol Auto 9mm 1A]]\n|[[File:Pistol Auto 9 mm 1A - Kolkata 2012-01-23 8779.JPG|frameless|220x220px]]\n|[[Semi-automatic pistol]]\n|[[9mm Parabellum|9\u00d719mm Parabellum]]\n|India\n|Standard issue firearm\n|-\n|[[Glock 17]]\n|[[File:Glock 17.JPG|frameless|220x220px]]\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|[[Semi-automatic pistol]]\n|}\n|[[9mm Parabellum|9\u00d719mm Parabellum]]\n|Austria\n|Standard Issue Firearm\n|-\n|[[IOF .32 revolver]]\n|[[File:IOF-32-REV-1.JPG|frameless|220x220px]]\n|[[Revolver]]\n|7.65mm x 23mm\n|India\n|Standard issue firearm\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" |\n=== [[Shotgun]] ===\n|-\n|[[OFB pump action Shotgun]]\n|\n|[[Pump action]]\n|[[12-gauge shotgun]]\n|India\n|Used mostly by prison service\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" |[[Submachine gun|Sub-Machine Gun]]\n|-\n![[Sterling submachine gun|SAF Carbine 2A1]]\n![[File:Sterling SMG.JPG|frameless|220x220px]]\n![[Submachine gun]]\n![[9mm Parabellum|9\u00d719mm Parabellum]]\n!India\n!Used by armed police and reserve police\n|-\n![[Heckler & Koch MP5]]\n![[File:Heckler & Koch MP5 b.jpg|frameless|220x220px]]\n![[Submachine gun]]\n![[9mm Parabellum|9\u00d719mm Parabellum]]\n!India\n!Used mainly by Police SWAT \n|-\n![[Sten|Sten Sub Machine]]\n![[File:Sten Mk II IMG 4781 (Nemo5576) noBG.png|frameless|220x220px]]\n![[Submachine gun]]\n![[9mm Parabellum|9\u00d719mm Parabellum]]\n!UK\n!Being phased out\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" |Assault Rifle/ Battle Rifles\n|-\n![[Ishapore 2A1 rifle]]\n![[File:RFI Rifle 7.62mm 2A1.JPG|frameless|220x220px]]\n![[Bolt action|bolt-action]]\n![[.303 British|.303 Mk VII SAA Ball]]\n!India\n!Being phased out, mainly retain for ceremonial purpose\n|-\n![[L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle]]\n![[File:SLRL1A1.jpg|frameless|220x220px]]\n![[Semi-automatic rifle]]\n![[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]]\n!India\n!Being phased out\n|-\n![[AKM]]\n![[File:AKM automatkarbin Ryssland - 7,62x39mm - Arm\u00e9museum rightside noBG.png|frameless|220x220px]]\n![[Assault rifle|Assault  Rifle]]\n![[7.62\u00d739mm]]\n!Bulgaria\n!\n|-\n![[INSAS|1B1 INSAS]]\n![[File:INSAS Standard Issue Assualt Rifle noBG.png|frameless|220x220px]]\n![[Assault rifle|Assault  Rifle]]\n![[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]]\n!India\n!Mainstay of police force\n|-\n![[Colt M4]]\n![[File:Colt LE694CK M4A1 Monolithic Carbine 11.5 inch.jpg|frameless]]\n!Assault rifle\n![[5.56 NATO]]\n!USA\n!Used by Mizoram Police\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" |Light Machine Gun\n|-\n![[Bren light machine gun|GUN MACHINE 7.62MM IA]]\n![[File:Bren wog.jpg|frameless|220x220px]]\n![[Light machine gun|Light machine Gun]]\n![[7.62\u00d751mm NATO|7.62 x 51 mm NATO]]\n!India\n!Being phased out\n|-\n!INSAS LMG\n![[File:INSAS LMG.JPG|frameless|220x220px]]\n![[Light machine gun|Light machine Gun]]\n![[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]]\n!India\n!\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" |Sniper Rifles\n|-\n![[M107 Long Range Sniper Rifle|M107]]\n![[File:M107 html 5f1f60d5.gif|frameless]]\n![[Sniper rifle|Sniper Rifle]]\n![[.416 Barrett|416 Barrett]]\n!USA\n!used by Mumbai Police's Force One  Commandos\n|}\n\n=={{anchor|Mukhbir informers network|Mukhbir|Mukhbirs|Informers network|Informers}}''Mukhbir''==\n{{anchor | Mukhbir informers network | Mukhbir }}\n{{Main|Police Mitra scheme}}\nInformers (''mukhbir'') provide information for financial compensation.

A [[Sega Saturn]] version was developed but never released. It is the fourth game in the ''[[Bubsy]]'' series as well as the first ''Bubsy'' game in [[Video game graphics#3D|3D]]. The game was released on November 25, 1996 in North America and in August 1997 in Europe. The game's complete name is a play on words in reference to ''[[Forbidden Planet]]'', a 1956 [[sci-fi]] film. The game follows Bubsy, an orange bobcat and the central character of the ''Bubsy'' series, who must stop a race of aliens known as the Woolies from stealing all of the Earth's [[yarn]] by traveling across their home planet of Rayon and collecting rocket pieces and atoms in order to build a rocket ship and return safely to Earth.\n\nWhile 3D video games had existed years before its release, ''Bubsy 3D'' was one of the first in the platforming genre to enable fully 3D exploration, alongside ''[[Super Mario 64]]''. Following the disappointing commercial performance of both ''[[Bubsy II]]'' and ''[[Bubsy in: Fractured Furry Tales]]'', Accolade turned to series creator [[Michael Berlyn]], who opted to make the game a 3D platformer. Though ''Bubsy 3D'' has often been referred to as a ''Super Mario 64'' clone, the two games were developed at the same time in almost complete isolation from each other.\n\n''Bubsy 3D'' received mostly negative reviews, with heavy criticism going towards the game's controls, camera, voice acting and personality of the title character, though the two-player mode was praised. The game has attracted infamy, with some sources listing it as [[List of video games notable for negative reception|one of the worst video games of all time]]. Following the game's release, the ''Bubsy'' series went dormant, not receiving a follow up until ''[[Bubsy: The Woolies Strike Back]]'' was released in 2017.\n\n==Gameplay==\n'tis ass\n\nIn levels, Bubsy can collect items called atoms. For every 50 atoms Bubsy collects, he will get an extra Paw Point. For every 100 atoms, he gets an extra life. If he gets 150 atoms, he will go to a bonus round with atoms and extra lives to collect. If he collects all 200 atoms in a level, he will get extra time in the bonus round. Bubsy can find two Rockets in each level (with the exception of the aforementioned boss fights); collecting all 32 of them will give the player a better ending.\n\nIn the two-player mode, Bubsy competes against an opponent in a race to collect atoms and rockets, and bop Woolies to get the highest score in a single level.\n\n==Plot==\n''Bubsy 3D'' takes place on Rayon, the home planet of the Woolies, a recurring race of aliens from previous installments in the series, and follows the title character, a bobcat named Bubsy, whose objective is to travel the planet in order to collect atoms and rocket pieces and build a [[rocket ship]]. Led by their two queens, Poly and Esther, the Woolies invade Earth and kidnap Bubsy, [[Bubsy in: Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind|who has previously foiled their plans for domination]], with the intention of stealing all of the planet's wool. However, Bubsy escapes from the Woolies' siege due to a chemical malfunction with the ship he is being carried in, and breaks loose onto Rayon, resulting in widespread panic across the planet. The Woolies decipher that Bubsy is attempting to gather atoms and rocket parts (both of which the Woolies consider worthless) in order to build a rocket ship. None of the scientists on Rayon understand exactly why Bubsy is doing this, but they believe him to be dangerous nonetheless, prompting them to call for a military campaign to locate and destroy the bobcat.\n\nThe game's ending is dictated by the player's in-game performance, specifically pertaining to the number of collectibles which they obtain in each level; if they do not collect all 32 of the rocket parts required to build a space ship, Bubsy, after being captured by the Woolies, uses his acquired rocket pieces, as well as the atom discharge withheld in his own fur, to build a rocket and attempt to escape back to Earth, only for the rocket to become stranded in outer space without the necessary components, thus allowing the Woolies to invade Earth without him interfering. If the player does succeed in collecting all of the rocket pieces, then the rocket is unable to handle the density of the number of atoms he has collected, and Bubsy, despite escaping the planet with a complete ship, becomes stranded in the Stone Age due to a rip in the space time continuum, allowing the Woolies to go through with their plans regardless.\n\n==Development and release==\n''Bubsy 3D'' was developed by [[SIE Bend Studio|Eidetic]] and published by [[Accolade (company)|Accolade]]. The game was designed by Bubsy creator [[Michael Berlyn]], and veteran games developer [[Marc Blank]] was also a key member of the development team.<ref name=EGM83>{{cite magazine |title=Bubsy 3D |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=83|publisher=Sendai Publishing |date=June 1996 |page=49}}</ref> According to Berlyn, after the second and third installments of ''Bubsy'' experienced mediocre commercial performance, Accolade asked him to head production of the next game in the series in hopes that he could revive the franchise. He agreed under the condition that the game would not be a rehash of the original game,<ref name=EGM83/> but a 3D platformer- a genre which hadn't been vastly explored yet at the time.<ref name=\"retrovolve\"/><ref name=\"Gamasutra\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=6716 |title=News - Playing Catch-Up: Bubsy's Michael Berlyn |website=Gamasutra |date=2005-10-03 |accessdate=2010-10-19}}</ref> Development of the game started in April 1995.<ref name=Eidetic>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=An interview with: Eidetic on Bubsy is 3D in \"Furbitten Planet\"|url=https://archive.org/stream/GamefanVolume4Issue09/GamefanVolume4Issue09September1996#page/n63/mode/2up|magazine= GameFan|pages= 62, 63|publisher= |date= September 1996}}</ref> The development team consisted of approximately eight people.<ref name=IGNbend>{{cite web|url=http://ign.com/articles/2011/09/08/from-syphon-filter-to-uncharted-sony-bends-story?page=1|title=From Syphon Filter to Uncharted Sony Bend's Story|last=Moriarty|first=Colin|date=September 8, 2011|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|accessdate=March 1, 2016}}</ref> Programmer Christopher Reese cited the development as a challenge, due to the team having no prior experience with making games in 3D.<ref name=IGNbend/> Unlike most console games of the time, flat shaded polygons were used instead of [[texture mapping|textured polygons]].<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Bubsy 3D |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=19|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=July 1996|page=60 |url=https://archive.org/stream/Next-Generation-1996-07/Next%20Generation%201996-07#page/n61/mode/2up}}</ref> However, the characters are [[Gouraud shading|Gouraud shaded]] and texture mapped.

While wandering the floor he saw the demonstration for ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', another 3D platform jumping game, but one built with [[Nintendo]]'s best resources in order to serve as the flagship title for a new gaming console. Berlyn realized that ''Bubsy 3D'' looked greatly inferior to ''Super Mario 64'', but as Accolade was already committed to releasing the game, it was too late to do anything except make ''Bubsy 3D'' as good as possible within the remaining time.<ref name=\"retrovolve\"/>\n\nIn Europe, distribution was handled by British publisher [[Telstar Electronic Studios]] under their budget label \"Telstar Fun & Games\".\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n<!-- Aggregators -->\n| GR = 51%<ref name=gr>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/ps/196832-bubsy-3d/index.html |title=Bubsy 3D for PlayStation |website=GameRankings |accessdate=2010-10-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191209001056/http://www.gamerankings.com/ps/196832-bubsy-3d/index.html |archivedate=December 9, 2019 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n<!-- Reviewers -->\n| EGM = 3.25/10<ref name=\"EGM89\">{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Review Crew: Bubsy 3D|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=89|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=December 1996|page=88}}</ref>\n| GameFan = 80, 79, 80<ref name=\"Gamefan5\"/>\n| GSpot = 5.5/10<ref name=\"GSpot\">{{cite web|last= |first= |url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/bubsy-3d-review/1900-2546891/ |title=Bubsy 3D Review |website=[[GameSpot]] |date=1996-12-01 |accessdate=2015-08-14}}</ref>\n| rev1= ''Absolute PlayStation''\n| rev1Score = 67/100<ref name=\"APB3D\">https://web.archive.org/web/20161111195746/http://www.absolute-playstation.com/api_review/rbubsy.htm</ref>\n| rev2=''[[The Electric Playground]]''\n| rev2Score = 4/10<ref name=\"EPrev\">{{cite web|last=Lucas|first=Victor|title=Bubsy 3D|url=http://www.elecplay.com/reviewfull_224.html|website=[[The Electric Playground]]|accessdate=16 January 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010511063016/http://www.elecplay.com/reviewfull_224.html|archivedate=11 May 2001|date=April 15, 1997|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n| rev3 = ''Gamezilla''\n| rev3Score = 81/100<ref name=\"Gamezilla\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamezilla.com/reviews2/bubsy.htm |title=Bubsy 3D |publisher=Gamezilla |accessdate=2016-03-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970117165804/http://gamezilla.com/reviews2/bubsy.htm |archivedate=January 17, 1997 }}</ref>\n| NGen = {{rating|2|5}}<ref name=\"NGen26\">{{cite magazine|last=|first= |title=Bubsy 3D|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=26 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=February 1997|page=120|quote=\"...establishing a new standard in the platform genre\"}}</ref>\n| rev5 = ''PSExtreme''\n| rev5Score = 93%<ref name=\"PSExRev\">{{cite book |author=Dave |title=Bubsy 3D |url=https://i.warosu.org/data/vr/img/0028/00/1447760678329.jpg |publisher=PSExtreme |page=87 |quote=\"BUBSY 3D looks to set the new standard in action platform gaming\"}}</ref>\n| rev6 = ''Ultra Game Players''\n| rev6Score = 6.1/10<ref name=\"Gameplayers\">{{Cite web\n|url=http://retrovolve.com/bubsy-3d-for-playstation-was-reviewed-by-ultra-game-players-magazine-in-1996/|title=Bubsy 3D for PlayStation Was Reviewed by Ultra Game Players Magazine in 1996|date=November 13, 2016|accessdate=2017-06-16|author=Josh Wirtanen|publisher=Retrovolve}}</ref>\n| rev7 = ''Super Juegos''\n| rev7Score = 75/100<ref>https://archive.org/stream/Superjuegos_062#page/n99</ref>\n| rev8 = ''A\u00e7\u00e3o Games''\n| rev8Score = 7/10<ref name=\"AGB3D\">https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File:AcaoGames_BR_112.pdf&page=31</ref>\n<!-- Awards -->\n| award1Pub = PSExtreme\n| award1 = Gold X Award<ref name=\"EXcavate\"/>\n}}\n\n''Bubsy 3D'' received a wide range of reviews upon release, but the majority were negative.

A [[Sega Saturn]] version was developed but never released. It is the fourth game in the ''[[Bubsy]]'' series as well as the first ''Bubsy'' game in [[Video game graphics#3D|3D]]. The game was released on November 25, 1996 in North America and in August 1997 in Europe. The game's complete name is a play on words in reference to ''[[Forbidden Planet]]'', a 1956 [[sci-fi]] film. The game follows Bubsy, an orange bobcat and the central character of the ''Bubsy'' series, who must stop a race of aliens known as the Woolies from stealing all of the Earth's [[yarn]] by traveling across their home planet of Rayon and collecting rocket pieces and atoms in order to build a rocket ship and return safely to Earth.\n\nWhile 3D video games had existed years before its release, ''Bubsy 3D'' was one of the first in the platforming genre to enable fully 3D exploration, alongside ''[[Super Mario 64]]''. Following the disappointing commercial performance of both ''[[Bubsy II]]'' and ''[[Bubsy in: Fractured Furry Tales]]'', Accolade turned to series creator [[Michael Berlyn]], who opted to make the game a 3D platformer. Though ''Bubsy 3D'' has often been referred to as a ''Super Mario 64'' clone, the two games were developed at the same time in almost complete isolation from each other.\n\n''Bubsy 3D'' received mostly negative reviews, with heavy criticism going towards the game's controls, camera, voice acting and personality of the title character, though the two-player mode was praised. The game has attracted infamy, with some sources listing it as [[List of video games notable for negative reception|one of the worst video games of all time]]. Following the game's release, the ''Bubsy'' series went dormant, not receiving a follow up until ''[[Bubsy: The Woolies Strike Back]]'' was released in 2017.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Bubsy 3D gameplay.png|left|thumb|Screenshot of the first level]]\nThe objective is to defeat the Woolies' two queens, Poly and Esther,{{#tag:ref|Poly and Esther debuted in ''Bubsy in: Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind'' as an orange two-headed Woolie. Here, they are purple and have their own bodies.|group=\"note\"}} and also escape from Rayon by collecting atoms and rocket parts. In ''Bubsy 3D'', players control the player-character Bubsy, who has several catchphrases that he says based on the player's actions.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Bubsy 3D: Clawing his Way Back After All these Years|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=88 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=November 1996 |pages=234-5}}</ref> Bubsy can jump high, glide, swim, and also pilot a rocket car in certain levels. <ref name=GPro99>{{cite magazine |title=Bubsy 3D |magazine=[[GamePro]] |issue=99|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=December 1996|page=81}}</ref> The player can hold L1 and move the D-pad to control the camera, and hold R1 while Bubsy is running to go faster. Bubsy defeats enemies by pouncing on them (either by jumping or gliding) or shooting atoms at them. He can now take four hits before losing a life. As an added luxury, Bubsy can extend his hit capacity by attacking running clams which give three random prizes. The game consists of 18 levels, with three of them taking place underwater; in these levels, Bubsy has an oxygen meter that depletes over time and his gliding action is replaced by a jetting dive which makes him swim faster and attack enemies, but depletes oxygen quicker. Bubsy can find air tanks in these levels to refill his air supply. There are also 2 levels which are boss fights; these have no rockets to collect. To complete a level (except a boss level), Bubsy has to touch the goal which is a large spinning red exclamation point with green rings around it.\n\nIn levels, Bubsy can collect items called atoms. For every 50 atoms Bubsy collects, he will get an extra Paw Point. For every 100 atoms, he gets an extra life. If he gets 150 atoms, he will go to a bonus round with atoms and extra lives to collect. If he collects all 200 atoms in a level, he will get extra time in the bonus round. Bubsy can find two Rockets in each level (with the exception of the aforementioned boss fights); collecting all 32 of them will give the player a better ending.\n\nIn the two-player mode, Bubsy competes against an opponent in a race to collect atoms and rockets, and bop Woolies to get the highest score in a single level.\n\n==Plot==\n''Bubsy 3D'' takes place on Rayon, the home planet of the Woolies, a recurring race of aliens from previous installments in the series, and follows the title character, a bobcat named Bubsy, whose objective is to travel the planet in order to collect atoms and rocket pieces and build a [[rocket ship]]. Led by their two queens, Poly and Esther, the Woolies invade Earth and kidnap Bubsy, [[Bubsy in: Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind|who has previously foiled their plans for domination]], with the intention of stealing all of the planet's wool. However, Bubsy escapes from the Woolies' siege due to a chemical malfunction with the ship he is being carried in, and breaks loose onto Rayon, resulting in widespread panic across the planet. The Woolies decipher that Bubsy is attempting to gather atoms and rocket parts (both of which the Woolies consider worthless) in order to build a rocket ship. None of the scientists on Rayon understand exactly why Bubsy is doing this, but they believe him to be dangerous nonetheless, prompting them to call for a military campaign to locate and destroy the bobcat.\n\nThe game's ending is dictated by the player's in-game performance, specifically pertaining to the number of collectibles which they obtain in each level; if they do not collect all 32 of the rocket parts required to build a space ship, Bubsy, after being captured by the Woolies, uses his acquired rocket pieces, as well as the atom discharge withheld in his own fur, to build a rocket and attempt to escape back to Earth, only for the rocket to become stranded in outer space without the necessary components, thus allowing the Woolies to invade Earth without him interfering. If the player does succeed in collecting all of the rocket pieces, then the rocket is unable to handle the density of the number of atoms he has collected, and Bubsy, despite escaping the planet with a complete ship, becomes stranded in the Stone Age due to a rip in the space time continuum, allowing the Woolies to go through with their plans regardless.\n\n==Development and release==\n''Bubsy 3D'' was developed by [[SIE Bend Studio|Eidetic]] and published by [[Accolade (company)|Accolade]]. The game was designed by Bubsy creator [[Michael Berlyn]], and veteran games developer [[Marc Blank]] was also a key member of the development team.<ref name=EGM83>{{cite magazine |title=Bubsy 3D |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=83|publisher=Sendai Publishing |date=June 1996 |page=49}}</ref> According to Berlyn, after the second and third installments of ''Bubsy'' experienced mediocre commercial performance, Accolade asked him to head production of the next game in the series in hopes that he could revive the franchise. He agreed under the condition that the game would not be a rehash of the original game,<ref name=EGM83/> but a 3D platformer- a genre which hadn't been vastly explored yet at the time.<ref name=\"retrovolve\"/><ref name=\"Gamasutra\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=6716 |title=News - Playing Catch-Up: Bubsy's Michael Berlyn |website=Gamasutra |date=2005-10-03 |accessdate=2010-10-19}}</ref> Development of the game started in April 1995.<ref name=Eidetic>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=An interview with: Eidetic on Bubsy is 3D in \"Furbitten Planet\"|url=https://archive.org/stream/GamefanVolume4Issue09/GamefanVolume4Issue09September1996#page/n63/mode/2up|magazine= GameFan|pages= 62, 63|publisher= |date= September 1996}}</ref> The development team consisted of approximately eight people.<ref name=IGNbend>{{cite web|url=http://ign.com/articles/2011/09/08/from-syphon-filter-to-uncharted-sony-bends-story?page=1|title=From Syphon Filter to Uncharted Sony Bend's Story|last=Moriarty|first=Colin|date=September 8, 2011|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|accessdate=March 1, 2016}}</ref> Programmer Christopher Reese cited the development as a challenge, due to the team having no prior experience with making games in 3D.<ref name=IGNbend/> Unlike most console games of the time, flat shaded polygons were used instead of [[texture mapping|textured polygons]].<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Bubsy 3D |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=19|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=July 1996|page=60 |url=https://archive.org/stream/Next-Generation-1996-07/Next%20Generation%201996-07#page/n61/mode/2up}}</ref> However, the characters are [[Gouraud shading|Gouraud shaded]] and texture mapped.

It was announced that it would be compatible with the Saturn analog controller to enable more sophisticated movement than the PlayStation version.<ref name=GPro99/> Berlyn attended the January 1996 [[Consumer Electronics Show]] to help demonstrate the ''Bubsy 3D'' beta personally. While wandering the floor he saw the demonstration for ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', another 3D platform jumping game, but one built with [[Nintendo]]'s best resources in order to serve as the flagship title for a new gaming console. Berlyn realized that ''Bubsy 3D'' looked greatly inferior to ''Super Mario 64'', but as Accolade was already committed to releasing the game, it was too late to do anything except make ''Bubsy 3D'' as good as possible within the remaining time.<ref name=\"retrovolve\"/>\n\nIn Europe, distribution was handled by British publisher [[Telstar Electronic Studios]] under their budget label \"Telstar Fun & Games\".\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n<!-- Aggregators -->\n| GR = 51%<ref name=gr>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/ps/196832-bubsy-3d/index.html |title=Bubsy 3D for PlayStation |website=GameRankings |accessdate=2010-10-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191209001056/http://www.gamerankings.com/ps/196832-bubsy-3d/index.html |archivedate=December 9, 2019 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n<!-- Reviewers -->\n| EGM = 3.25/10<ref name=\"EGM89\">{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Review Crew: Bubsy 3D|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=89|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=December 1996|page=88}}</ref>\n| GameFan = 80, 79, 80<ref name=\"Gamefan5\"/>\n| GSpot = 5.5/10<ref name=\"GSpot\">{{cite web|last= |first= |url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/bubsy-3d-review/1900-2546891/ |title=Bubsy 3D Review |website=[[GameSpot]] |date=1996-12-01 |accessdate=2015-08-14}}</ref>\n| rev1= ''Absolute PlayStation''\n| rev1Score = 67/100<ref name=\"APB3D\">https://web.archive.org/web/20161111195746/http://www.absolute-playstation.com/api_review/rbubsy.htm</ref>\n| rev2=''[[The Electric Playground]]''\n| rev2Score = 4/10<ref name=\"EPrev\">{{cite web|last=Lucas|first=Victor|title=Bubsy 3D|url=http://www.elecplay.com/reviewfull_224.html|website=[[The Electric Playground]]|accessdate=16 January 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010511063016/http://www.elecplay.com/reviewfull_224.html|archivedate=11 May 2001|date=April 15, 1997|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n| rev3 = ''Gamezilla''\n| rev3Score = 81/100<ref name=\"Gamezilla\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamezilla.com/reviews2/bubsy.htm |title=Bubsy 3D |publisher=Gamezilla |accessdate=2016-03-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970117165804/http://gamezilla.com/reviews2/bubsy.htm |archivedate=January 17, 1997 }}</ref>\n| NGen = {{rating|2|5}}<ref name=\"NGen26\">{{cite magazine|last=|first= |title=Bubsy 3D|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=26 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=February 1997|page=120|quote=\"...establishing a new standard in the platform genre\"}}</ref>\n| rev5 = ''PSExtreme''\n| rev5Score = 93%<ref name=\"PSExRev\">{{cite book |author=Dave |title=Bubsy 3D |url=https://i.warosu.org/data/vr/img/0028/00/1447760678329.jpg |publisher=PSExtreme |page=87 |quote=\"BUBSY 3D looks to set the new standard in action platform gaming\"}}</ref>\n| rev6 = ''Ultra Game Players''\n| rev6Score = 6.1/10<ref name=\"Gameplayers\">{{Cite web\n|url=http://retrovolve.com/bubsy-3d-for-playstation-was-reviewed-by-ultra-game-players-magazine-in-1996/|title=Bubsy 3D for PlayStation Was Reviewed by Ultra Game Players Magazine in 1996|date=November 13, 2016|accessdate=2017-06-16|author=Josh Wirtanen|publisher=Retrovolve}}</ref>\n| rev7 = ''Super Juegos''\n| rev7Score = 75/100<ref>https://archive.org/stream/Superjuegos_062#page/n99</ref>\n| rev8 = ''A\u00e7\u00e3o Games''\n| rev8Score = 7/10<ref name=\"AGB3D\">https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File:AcaoGames_BR_112.pdf&page=31</ref>\n<!-- Awards -->\n| award1Pub = PSExtreme\n| award1 = Gold X Award<ref name=\"EXcavate\"/>\n}}\n\n''Bubsy 3D'' received a wide range of reviews upon release, but the majority were negative.

He added, \"As disappointing as the visuals of Bubsy 3D are, it is the game's lack of speed and sloppy control that really make it a pain to play. ... even rotating around to see what is behind you is like trying to [[Scuba dive]] in Jell-o\".<ref name=\"EPrev\"/> Mark Skorupa of ''Gamezilla'' said the game had potential but fails to effectively stand up to recent platformers, chiefly because of its controls: \"Platform games require precise actions and split second decisions.
