Its affiliate [[EPM Telecomunicaciones]], which operates under the name [[Tigo (Colombia)|UNE]], controls seven other companies in various cities around the country.\n\nOrganized as a state-owned, industrial and commercial enterprise, owned by the municipality of Medellin, EPM provides [[electricity]], [[gas]], [[water]], [[sanitation]], and [[telecommunications]].\n\nEPM is present in following areas in Colombia: Antioquia, Bogot\u00e1, Manizales, Armenia, Pereira, Bucaramanga, C\u00facuta, Barranquilla, Cartagena, Cali, and Quibd\u00f3.\n\nEPM international: in Panama, the company is implementing the [[Bonyic hydroelectric project]] through its affiliate ''Hidroecol\u00f3gica del Teribe''.  In Guadalajara, Mexico, it is providing advice and technical assistance for the implementation of potable water, sanitary sewers, and wastewater treatment projects; and it is providing telecommunications services in the United States and Spain under the brand UNE.\n\n[[File:EDIFICIO EPM.jpg|thumb|240px|[[EPM Intelligent Building]], the headquarters of EPM.]].\n\n==Strategic business units==\nElectricity, gas over a pipeline, waters and telecommunications:  EPM has been active in these four areas of public utilities and is currently implementing a number of projects to consolidate its leadership.\n\n===Energy===\nResearch and use of different energy sources, the development of a complete distribution system that reaches every musicality and Antioquia, and the provision of gas over a network are aspects of a company that holds an outstanding place in the Colombian electrical sector, supplying 23.9% share of the demand in the country.\n\nEPM has built the backbone of the hydroelectric system in Colombia.  After many years of experience developing hydroelectric projects, EPM has been advancing for more than a decade with research on the use of other energy sources as a way to contribute to the planet's environmental sustainability and to open new areas for its national and international growth.\n\n* Net effective capacity of EPM's generation system: 2597.6 MW, equivalent to 19.34% of the nation\u2019s installed generation capacity.\n* Distribution system: 22% of the national total.\n* Gas over a pipeline: 9% share in the Colombian market.\n\n====Energy generation====\n* Hydroelectric power stations: 24\n* Thermoelectric power stations: 1 (La Sierra thermoelectric power station, municipality of Puerto Nare, Antioquia)\n* Wind Farms: 1 (Jepirachi, in the upper Colombian region Guajira)\n\nPorce III and Porce IV, with a capacity of 660 MW and 400 MW respectively, are two of the hydroelectric generation projects currently under construction.\n\nThe first generation unit in Porce III will start producing electrical energy at the end of 2010, and around the same time construction of the first civil works for Porce IV will begin. Operations will start in 2015.\n\nIn Panama, through its affiliate ''Hidrol\u00f3gica del Teribe'' (HET), the Bonyic hydroelectric power station is being built. This power station will be able to generate up to 31.3 MW and will contribute to decrease that country's dependence on imported oil and other fossil fuels that are highly contaminating of the environment.\n\nIn Colombia, EPM is also part of the corporation that is working to develop the [[Ituango Dam|Hidroituango project]], which will have the largest capacity in the country with a total of 2400 MW.\n\nAll these projects that consolidate EPM's important role in the Colombian electrical landscape also indicate the path taken in their research on alternative energy sources. For example, the pioneering experience of [[Renewable_energy_in_Colombia#Wind|Jepirachi]] which uses wind energy, and La Vuelta and La Herradura micro power stations which meet the conditions established by the [[Kyoto Protocol]] as a mechanism for clean development.\n\n====Energy transmission and distribution====\n* Networks: 60,255&nbsp;km\n* Transformers: 90,000\n* Substations: 133\n\nEPM brings the magic of light to thousands of people in Antioquia.

It was released on August 23, 2019, through [[Republic Records]]. As the [[executive producer]], Swift worked with producers [[Jack Antonoff]], [[Louis Bell]], [[Frank Dukes]] and [[Joel Little]] on the album. Described by Swift as \"a love letter to love itself\", the album celebrates the ups and downs of love, incorporating brighter and cheerful tones, departing from the dark sounds of its predecessor, ''[[Reputation (Taylor Swift album)|Reputation]]'' (2017). The album's cover art and music videos marked a change in Swift's visual appearance, which now embodies a [[summer]] aesthetic, consisting mainly of [[Pastel (color)|pastel colors]]. Musically, it is a [[Pop music|pop]], [[synth-pop]], [[electropop]] and [[pop rock]] record that contains influences of [[Country music|country]], [[dream pop]], [[bubblegum pop]], [[funk]], [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[pop punk]] and [[indie pop]].\n\n''Lover'' features collaborations with the [[Dixie Chicks]] and [[Brendon Urie]] of [[Panic! at the Disco]]. It was preceded by three singles, all peaking inside the top 10 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]; \"[[Me!]]\" and \"[[You Need To Calm Down]]\" peaked at number two, while the [[Lover (Taylor Swift song)|title track]] reached number 10. All 18 tracks of the album charted simultaneously on the Hot 100 chart upon the album's release. \"[[The Man (Taylor Swift song)|The Man]]\" was released as the fourth single on January 27, 2020. The album received positive reviews from critics, who commended Swift's songwriting conveying emotional maturity and honesty. However, a few commentators found the album \"lengthy\" and \"inconsistent\" in places.\n\n''Lover'' debuted atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, moving 867,000 units in its first week. It also debuted at number one in many countries including Australia, Canada, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain and the UK. ''Lover'' was certified [[RIAA certification|double platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] for moving over 2 million units in the US. It was the best selling album of 2019 in the country. Globally, ''Lover'' was the best selling album by a solo artist of 2019. As of January 2020, it has sold over 3.2 million pure copies worldwide. To promote the album, Swift is set to embark on the [[Lover Fest]], her sixth [[concert tour]] and first [[music festival]] tour, beginning on June 20, 2020.\n\n''Lover'' received a nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album|Best Pop Vocal Album]] at the [[62nd Annual Grammy Awards|62nd Grammy Awards]], which is Swift's third consecutive nomination in the category, following ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'' (2014) and ''Reputation'' (2017), while its singles \"You Need To Calm Down\" and \"Lover\" were nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance|Best Pop Solo Performance]] and [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]], respectively. The album appeared on numerous year-end best music lists of 2019.\n\n==Background==\nSpeculation of the album started on February 24, 2019, when Swift posted a photo of seven palm trees to her [[Instagram]] account,<ref>{{cite web |last=Elizabeth |first=De |title=Taylor Swift Might Have Just Dropped a Huge Clue About Her Next Album |url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/taylor-swift-instagram-palm-trees-fan-theories-next-album |website=Teen Vogue |accessdate=July 9, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190326190044/https://www.teenvogue.com/story/taylor-swift-instagram-palm-trees-fan-theories-next-album |archive-date=March 26, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> which the singer later confirmed was the day she finished the album.<ref name=\"EWMay\">{{cite magazine|last=Suskind|first=Alex|title=New Reputation: Taylor Swift shares intel on TS7, fan theories, and her next era|url=https://ew.com/music/2019/05/09/taylor-swift-cover-story/|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=August 17, 2019|date=May 9, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190812135902/https://ew.com/music/2019/05/09/taylor-swift-cover-story/|archive-date=August 12, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> On April 13, Swift released a countdown on her official website, counting down to midnight [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] ([[UTC\u221204:00]]) on April 26.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8506993/taylor-swift-countdown-clock-april-26|title=Taylor Swift Updates Her Website With Countdown Clock, Teases April 26 Date|first=Katie|last=Atkinson|website=Billboard|date=April 13, 2019|accessdate=July 23, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190416134018/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8506993/taylor-swift-countdown-clock-april-26|archive-date=April 16, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> On April 25, several news outlets reported that a [[mural]] of a butterfly in [[The Gulch, Nashville, Tennessee|The Gulch]] neighborhood of [[Nashville, Tennessee]], painted by street artist Kelsey Montague,<ref name=\"Tennessean\">{{cite web|url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2019/04/25/taylor-swift-announcement-2019-nashville-gulch-mural/3572564002/|title=Is Taylor Swift's announcement linked to activity in Nashville's Gulch?

It was released on August 23, 2019, through [[Republic Records]]. As the [[executive producer]], Swift worked with producers [[Jack Antonoff]], [[Louis Bell]], [[Frank Dukes]] and [[Joel Little]] on the album. Described by Swift as \"a love letter to love itself\", the album celebrates the ups and downs of love, incorporating brighter and cheerful tones, departing from the dark sounds of its predecessor, ''[[Reputation (Taylor Swift album)|Reputation]]'' (2017). The album's cover art and music videos marked a change in Swift's visual appearance, which now embodies a [[summer]] aesthetic, consisting mainly of [[Pastel (color)|pastel colors]]. Musically, it is a [[Pop music|pop]], [[synth-pop]], [[electropop]] and [[pop rock]] record that contains influences of [[Country music|country]], [[dream pop]], [[bubblegum pop]], [[funk]], [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[pop punk]] and [[indie pop]].\n\n''Lover'' features collaborations with the [[Dixie Chicks]] and [[Brendon Urie]] of [[Panic! at the Disco]]. It was preceded by three singles, all peaking inside the top 10 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]; \"[[Me!]]\" and \"[[You Need To Calm Down]]\" peaked at number two, while the [[Lover (Taylor Swift song)|title track]] reached number 10. All 18 tracks of the album charted simultaneously on the Hot 100 chart upon the album's release. \"[[The Man (Taylor Swift song)|The Man]]\" was released as the fourth single on January 27, 2020. The album received positive reviews from critics, who commended Swift's songwriting conveying emotional maturity and honesty. However, a few commentators found the album \"lengthy\" and \"inconsistent\" in places.\n\n''Lover'' debuted atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, moving 867,000 units in its first week. It also debuted at number one in many countries including Australia, Canada, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain and the UK. ''Lover'' was certified [[RIAA certification|double platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] for moving over 2 million units in the US.

In 2018, Film Museum D\u00fcsseldorf catalogued all written documents from the films.\n\n== Cinematic approach ==\n[[Dieter Kosslick]], former director of [[Berlin International Film Festival]] outlined Herbrich's working style as follows:\n\n\"Fortunately Oliver Herbrich doesn\u2019t create an ideology when walking the line between fictional movie and documentary film. Herbrich\u2019s approach is solely based on the storytelling needs of the subjects. Remarkably, this technique results in a combination of documentary and fictional elements. There\u2019s one scene sequence during the ''Mathias Kneissl'' movie, when the gendarmerie brigade is closing in on the folk hero. The resulting police violence is reminiscent of documentary reports. Vice versa, his documentary films include elements of fiction. The scenes of gold diggers carrying sacks of mud uphill from their claims in the documentary ''Searching for El Dorado'' reminds the viewer of monumental feature movies. This evokes a mythologization of the real life, revealing the general in the particular. One can describe Herbrich\u2019s films as stories about human behavior, depicting the mechanisms of reality. Reaching limits and crossing borders is something to be taken in the literal sense in Herbrich\u2019s oeuvre.\u201c (Dieter Kosslick, 1994).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://582b21a9-78cb-4db6-9393-a87d88b491be.filesusr.com/ugd/1150ef_f943a2006f944fed97cc8d6bb0a017c2.pdf|title=Laudation Film Prize Munich|last=Kosslick|first=Dieter|date=1994|website=(German)|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n* 1979/80 ''The Proud and Sad Life of Mathias Kneissl'' (Das stolze und traurige Leben des Mathias Knei\u00dfl)\n* 1982 ''Dead Heart'' (Totes Herz)\n* 1983/84 ''Searching for El Dorado'' (Auf der Suche nach El Dorado)\n* 1983/84 ''Wodzeck''\n* 1985/86 ''The Bavarian Al Capone'' (Der Al Capone vom Donaumoos)\n* 1986/87 The World beyond the World (Die Welt jenseits der Welt)\n* 1987 ''Bikini \u2013 mon amour''\n* 1988/89 ''Earthbound'' (Erdenschwer)\n* 1991 ''Priests of the Condemned'' (Priester der Verdammten)\n* 1992/93 ''Rules of the Road'' (Gesetz der Stra\u00dfe)\n\n== Awards ==\n\n* 1980 and 1984 [[Deutsche Film- und Medienbewertung (FBW)|rating]] \u201cHighly Recommended\u201d for ''Mathias Kneissl'' and ''Searching for El Dorado''\n* 1985 Prix d'[[France 2|Antenne II]], Paris (Festival [[Cin\u00e9ma du R\u00e9el|Cinema du Re\u00e9l)]] for ''Searching for El Dorado''; 2nd Prize Cine-stud Film Fest, Amsterdam for ''Searching for El Dorado''; Best Male Actor (International Film Festival Moskow) for Detlef K\u00fcgow in ''Wodzeck''\n* 1989 Honorary Mention at 4th Medikinale International Parma, Italy for ''Bikini \u2013 mon amour''; Honorary Mention at Red Cross and Health Film Fest Varna, Bulgaria for ''Bikini \u2013 mon amour''\n* 1990 Best Screenplay (Festival Imag Fic, Madrid) for ''Earthbound''; Best Artistic Contribution (Festival Europa Cinema, Viareggio)  for ''Earthbound''; Prix de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration international del Cine Club (Festival Figuera da Foz, Portugal)  for ''Earthbound''\n* 1994 Film Prize of the City of Munich (lifetime achievement)\n\n== Retrospectives ==\n\n* 1987 Low Budget Festival Hamburg, Germany\n* 1989 Film Week Onikon Cinema Herdecke, Germany\n* 1990 West Virginia Film Festival, Charleston, USA\n* 1993 Film Museum D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany\n* 1994 Film Museum Munich, Germany\n* 2018 Breitwand Cinema Gauting, Germany\n\n== Social Engagement ==\n\n* 1990\u20132000 Sponsor \u201cAward for the Outstanding Documentary\u201c ([[Internationales Dokumentarfilmfestival M\u00fcnchen|International Documentary Film Festival Munich]]) \n* 2010 start of charity NGO \u201cFoundation Oliver Herbrich Children's Fund\u201d\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n== Further reading ==\n*[https://portal.dnb.de/opac.htm?method=simpleSearch&query=1062258479 Literature by Oliver Herbrich] in the [[German National Library]]\n*[https://search.onb.ac.at/primo-explore/search?institution=43ACC_ONB&vid=ONB&tab=default_tab&search_scope=ONB_gesamtbestand&mode=basic&displayMode=full&bulkSize=10&highlight=true&dum=true&query=any,contains,Oliver%20Herbrich&displayField=all&lang=de_DE Literature by Oliver Herbrich] in the [[Austrian National Library]]\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://oliver-herbrich.wixsite.com/archiv/english Oliver Herbrich Filmarchive] (English)\n*[https://www.filmportal.de/en/person/oliver-herbrich_f31295e67ff5a3cfe03053d50b373efb Oliver Herbrich] on filmportal.de (English)\n*[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0378688/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1 Oliver Herbrich] on IMDb.com (English)\n*[https://www.zweitausendeins.de/filmlexikon/?sucheNach=personNr&wert=44 Oliver Herbrich] in Lexikon des int.

Herbrich\u2019s approach is solely based on the storytelling needs of the subjects. Remarkably, this technique results in a combination of documentary and fictional elements. There\u2019s one scene sequence during the ''Mathias Kneissl'' movie, when the gendarmerie brigade is closing in on the folk hero. The resulting police violence is reminiscent of documentary reports. Vice versa, his documentary films include elements of fiction. The scenes of gold diggers carrying sacks of mud uphill from their claims in the documentary ''Searching for El Dorado'' reminds the viewer of monumental feature movies. This evokes a mythologization of the real life, revealing the general in the particular. One can describe Herbrich\u2019s films as stories about human behavior, depicting the mechanisms of reality. Reaching limits and crossing borders is something to be taken in the literal sense in Herbrich\u2019s oeuvre.\u201c (Dieter Kosslick, 1994).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://582b21a9-78cb-4db6-9393-a87d88b491be.filesusr.com/ugd/1150ef_f943a2006f944fed97cc8d6bb0a017c2.pdf|title=Laudation Film Prize Munich|last=Kosslick|first=Dieter|date=1994|website=(German)|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n* 1979/80 ''The Proud and Sad Life of Mathias Kneissl'' (Das stolze und traurige Leben des Mathias Knei\u00dfl)\n* 1982 ''Dead Heart'' (Totes Herz)\n* 1983/84 ''Searching for El Dorado'' (Auf der Suche nach El Dorado)\n* 1983/84 ''Wodzeck''\n* 1985/86 ''The Bavarian Al Capone'' (Der Al Capone vom Donaumoos)\n* 1986/87 The World beyond the World (Die Welt jenseits der Welt)\n* 1987 ''Bikini \u2013 mon amour''\n* 1988/89 ''Earthbound'' (Erdenschwer)\n* 1991 ''Priests of the Condemned'' (Priester der Verdammten)\n* 1992/93 ''Rules of the Road'' (Gesetz der Stra\u00dfe)\n\n== Awards ==\n\n* 1980 and 1984 [[Deutsche Film- und Medienbewertung (FBW)|rating]] \u201cHighly Recommended\u201d for ''Mathias Kneissl'' and ''Searching for El Dorado''\n* 1985 Prix d'[[France 2|Antenne II]], Paris (Festival [[Cin\u00e9ma du R\u00e9el|Cinema du Re\u00e9l)]] for ''Searching for El Dorado''; 2nd Price Cine-stud Film Fest, Amsterdam for ''Searching for El Dorado''; Best Male Actor (International Film Festival Moskow) for Detlef K\u00fcgow in ''Wodzeck''\n* 1989 Honorary Mention at 4th Medikinale International Parma, Italy for ''Bikini \u2013 mon amour''; Honorary Mention at Red Cross and Health Film Fest Varna, Bulgaria for ''Bikini \u2013 mon amour''\n* 1990 Best Screenplay (Festival Imag Fic, Madrid) for ''Earthbound''; Best Artistic Contribution (Festival Europa Cinema, Viareggio)  for ''Earthbound''; Prix de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration international del Cine Club (Festival Figuera da Foz, Portugal)  for ''Earthbound''\n* 1994 Film Prize of the City of Munich (lifetime achievement)\n\n== Retrospectives ==\n\n* 1987 Low Budget Festival Hamburg, Germany\n* 1989 Film Week Onikon Cinema Herdecke, Germany\n* 1990 West Virginia Film Festival, Charleston, USA\n* 1993 Film Museum D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany\n* 1994 Film Museum Munich, Germany\n* 2018 Breitwand Cinema Gauting, Germany\n\n== Social Engagement ==\n\n* 1990\u20132000 Sponsor \u201cAward for the Outstanding Documentary\u201c ([[Internationales Dokumentarfilmfestival M\u00fcnchen|International Documentary Film Festival Munich]]) \n* 2010 start of charity NGO \u201cFoundation Oliver Herbrich Children's Fund\u201d\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n== Further reading ==\n*[https://portal.dnb.de/opac.htm?method=simpleSearch&query=1062258479 Literature by Oliver Herbrich] in the [[German National Library]]\n*[https://search.onb.ac.at/primo-explore/search?institution=43ACC_ONB&vid=ONB&tab=default_tab&search_scope=ONB_gesamtbestand&mode=basic&displayMode=full&bulkSize=10&highlight=true&dum=true&query=any,contains,Oliver%20Herbrich&displayField=all&lang=de_DE Literature by Oliver Herbrich] in the [[Austrian National Library]]\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://oliver-herbrich.wixsite.com/archiv/english Oliver Herbrich Filmarchive] (English)\n*[https://www.filmportal.de/en/person/oliver-herbrich_f31295e67ff5a3cfe03053d50b373efb Oliver Herbrich] on filmportal.de (English)\n*[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0378688/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1 Oliver Herbrich] on IMDb.com (English)\n*[https://www.zweitausendeins.de/filmlexikon/?sucheNach=personNr&wert=44 Oliver Herbrich] in Lexikon des int.

His works of criticism include ''Shakespeare in Art'' (1901) and ''Japanese Art'' (1904).

Due to his age and health conditions, Hartmann was one of only a few Japanese Americans on the West Coast to avoid the [[Internment of Japanese Americans|mass incarceration]] during World War II, although the FBI and local officials visited the ranch often to conduct investigations.<ref name=Densho/>  In 1944, he died while visiting another daughter in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]]. A collection of his papers is held at the University of California, Riverside, including correspondence related to his obtaining permission to remain in Banning during the war.\n\n== Involvement in anarchist movement ==\n\nThe following biography of Sadakichi Hartmann is taken from Paul Avrich's ''The Modern School Movememnt'' from page 134-138\n\n\"Next to [[Hippolyte_Havel|Havel]], the most exotic personality at the [[Ferrer_Center_and_Colony|Ferrer Center]] was Sadakichi Hartmann. Hartmann's father was a German merchant, his mother a Japanese woman who died soon after childbirth, and Sadakichi, according to [[Manuel_Komroff|Manuel Komroff]], \"inherited the worst traits of both races.\" Like Havel, he was an inverterate sponger and drinker (\"a tremendous boozehound,\" to quote Maurice Hollod). Sadakichi in Japanese means \"steady luck,\" or \"fortunate if constant.\" \"The moniker means 'Gimme some dough,'\" quipped [[W._C._Fields|W. C. Fields]], who knew him from his Hollywood years. According to [[John_Barrymore|John Barrymore]], he was \"presumably sired by Mephistopheles out of Madame Butterfly.\"\n\nBorn in Nagasaki in 1867, Sadakichi was sent to Germany to be raised in the household of a wealthy Hamburg uncle, \"among whose books and art treasures,\" he would recall, \"I spent my childhood, and whom I have to thank for my first appreciation of art.\" For his education he was sent to a naval academy at Kiel, but he rebelled against the strict military discipline and ran away to Paris, whereupon his father disinherited him and shipped him off to relations in Philadelphia. Arriving in 1882, he worked at a succession of menial jobs while reading in the library at night. When he learned that Walt Whitman lived across the river in Camden, New Jersey, he visited the aging poet and they fried eggs together, recited verses, and discussed literature and art.\n\nSadakichi emerged as a man of diverse artistic talents, \"poet, writer, painter, and a marvelous reader of the poems and stories of Whitman and Poe,\" as [[Emma_Goldman|Emma Goldman]] describes him. He wrote fiction, drama, poetry, essays, and sketches, half a dozen books and hundreds of articles in the fields of painting and photography, including important studies of Japanese and American art. In the 1880's and '90's he was already informing the American public, in wide range of magazines and newspapers, both in German and English, anout Ibsen and the French Symbolists, and introducing Japanese art and literature to women's clubs of Philadelphia, Boston, and New York. He was probably the first person, according to [[Kenneth_Rexroth|Kenneth Rexroth]], to write English haiku (\"White petals afloat / On a winding woodland stream / What else is life's dream?\"). In 1897 he produced the first psychedelic light show, and in 1902 held his first \"perfume concert.\" He also fave lessons in body language, mostly to \"young women, fascinated by his rakish good looks, restless energy, and courtly manners.\"\n\nEzra Pound, with whom he corresponded, placed him at the head of the lost legion of American avant-garde writers of the fin-de-siecle era, and Alfred Stieglitz considered him one of the best critics of photography in the United States. (He was a regular contributor to Stieglitz's ''Camera Work'', writing as \"Sidney Allan\" when he was not under his own name or initials.)\n\nIn physique Sadakachi was tall and thin - so thin, a friend remarked, that he \"looked as if he only exhaled and never inhaled.\" Immensely photogenic in spite of his rotting teeth, he was incapable of being photographed badly. Thousands of pictures were taken of him, not one without interest. Attractive to women, he sired a dozen children, most of whom he gave the names of flowers or herbs. In 1891 he married Elizabeth Blanche Walsh, the daughter of an English colonel, who bore him five of his children and served as his secretary for many years. Long after he deserted her in 1910, she still spoke of him with loyalty and affection, once saying: \"He was three parts genius and one part devil, and I was in love with all four parts.\"\n\n\"Sadakichi is singular, never plural,\" [[Gertrude_Stein|Gertrude Stein]] remarked. Vain, stubborn, eccentric, he was capable of the most outlandish behaviour. On one occasion, masquerading as a Japanese prince with an escort of costumed companions, he hoodwinked the City of New York into holding a parade down Broadway. \"A grotesque etched in flesh by the drunken Goya of Heaven, wrote [[Benjamin_De_Casseres|Benjamin De Casseres]] of Sadakichi. \"A grinning, obscene gargoyle on the Temple of American Letters. Superman bum. Half Gof, half Hooligan; all artist. Anarch, sadist, satyr. A fusion of Japanese and German, the ghastly experiment of an Occidental on the person of an Oriental. Sublime, ridiculous, impossible. A genius of the ateliers, picture studios, ginmills, and East Side lobscouse restaurants. A dancing dervish, with graceful, Gargantuan feet and a mouth like the Cloaca Maxima. A painter out of Hakusai, Manet, Whistler. Result: fantastic realism. A colosal ironist, a suave pessimist, a Dionysiac Wobbly.\" \n\nIn a philosophical sense at least, Sadakichi was also an anarchist. He called on [[Peter_Kropotkin|Kropotkin]] when the Russian prince visited New York in 1897 on his first lecture tour of America. He attended anarchist meetings, mingled in anarchist circles, was friendly with Goldman and [[Alexander_Berkman|Berkman]], and contributed to [[Mother_Earth_(magazine)|Mother Earth]] and other anarchist publications. Among his pieces was a poem to [[Francisco_Ferrer|Ferrer]], and Tobias Sigel of the Detroit Modern School was his old friend and physician. Regarding life and art as \"the twin flames of revolt,\" he refused to be herded along by prevailing tastes and standards, and he rejected \"stagnant crowd-thinking and mass-meeting morality.\" Unlike Havel, however, he remained on the periphery of the anarchist movement, a sympathizer rather than an activist, too cynical perhaps to believe in a successful libertarian revolution that would inaugurate the stateless millennium. \"I personally do not believe in reform,\" he wrote to a friend. \"Human nature in itself (in all of us) is so beastly and nasty that reform is impossible.\"\n\nFor several years the Ferrer Center was Sadakichi's chief point of contact with the anarchists. \"He fell in love with the Ferrer gang,\" Maurice Hollod recalls, \"for they were the very warp and woof of what he stood for.\" An admirer of Henri and Bellows, he drifted in and out of their art class, \"loaded with fire-water and bacchanalic spirits.\" (On such occasions, of course, work from nude models had to be suspended.)\n\nA gifted reciter and performer, Sadakichi became one of the Center's star attractions. When he opened his mouth to speak, says Manuel Komroff, he was toothless \"except two tusks,\" but he had \"a fine, sonorous voice, which today would be thought too dramatic.\" Apart from declaiming his own verse, he read from Whitman and Poe and [[Amy_Lowell|Amy Lowell]], from [[Leo_Tolstoy|Tolstoy]] and [[Ambrose_Bierce|Ambrose Bierce]]. He staged shadow pictures and perfume concerts, pantomimes and hand dances. \"Nobody danced like Sadakichi,\" was the general verdict.\n\nThe high point, however, arrived when he read from his cycle of symbolist dramas, ''Confucius, Buddha, Christ,'' and ''Mohammed'' (\"providing Sadakichi doesn't change his mind\", the programs warned). When ''Christ'', which [[James_Huneker|James Gibbons Huneker]] pronounced \"absolutely the most daring of all decadent productions,\" was published in Boston in 1893, the work was immediately confiscated and burned, and Sadakichi himself was arrested and spent Christmas week in the Charles Street jail. ''Buddha'', published in 1897, was described by [[Vance_Thompson|Vance Thompson]] as \"strange, gaudy, fantastic - a thing all color and incense; something as gilded and monstrous and uncouth as the temple of Benares.\" When Sadakichi read from ''Christ'' at the Ferrer Center in 1915, Maurice Hollod was in the audience. \"The first night,\" he remembers, \"limousines pulled up with women in fur coats and lorgnettes, things never seen on 107th Street before! During the intermission he drank a pint of liquor to get primed for the second act. During one particularly obscene segment, the rich ladies all got up and walked out.\"\n\nVery poor during these years, Sadakichi subsisted on handouts and small sums earned from his articles and sketches. [[Hutchins_Hapgood|Hutchins Hapgood]] remembers visiting his apartment one day and \"admiring him tremendously because of the way he could quietly sit and work or talk while the children, like flies, dropped all over him. Certainly a man who could accommodate himself as beautifully to the life of the young had something.\" And yet he could not maintain a secure existence. Unable to discipline his unruly talents, he alternated, as his biographers have noted, between \"the Bohemian stance and the role of a serious scholar.\" He was an important historian of art, observed a pupil of Henri and Bellows, but he was also an opportunist, \"a con-man who sought patrons and felt the world owed him something.\" To Jacques Rudome, who taught French at the Center, he was a \"half-baked genius with great promise that blew up in smoke,\" like one of his perfume concerts.\" <ref>{{cite book |last1=Avrich |first1=Paul |title=The Modern School Movement |date=2006 |publisher=AK Press |location=Oakland CA |isbn=1-904859097 |pages=134\u2013138}}</ref> \n\n\n[[File:Sadakichi At the Ferrer Centre.jpg|thumb|\"Sadakichi, trying hard to be a great man, went frying eggs with the great whitman]]\n\n==Bibliography==\n*''Christ: A Dramatic Poem in Three Acts'' (play, 1893)\n*''Buddha: A Drama in Twelve Scenes'' (play, 1897)\n*''Mohammed'' (play, 1899)\n*''Schopenhauer in the Air: Seven Stories'' (1899)\n*''Shakespeare in Art'' (1900)\n*''A History of American Art'' (1901)\n*''Japanese Art'' (1903) [https://archive.org/details/japaneseart00hartuoft]\n*''Drifting Flowers of the Sea and Other Poems'' (1904) [https://archive.org/details/driftingflowers00hartgoog/page/n7]\n*''Landscape and Figure Composition'' (1910) [https://archive.org/details/landscapeandfig00hartgoog/page/n11]\n*''My Theory of Soul Atoms'' (1910) [https://books.google.com/books/about/My_Theory_of_Soul_atoms.html?id=J69mHQAACAAJ]\n*''The Whistler Book'' (1910) [https://archive.org/details/whistlerbook017052mbp]\n*''My Rubaiyat'' (1913) [https://archive.org/details/myrubaiyat00hartrich]\n*''Permanent Peace: Is it a Dream?''

Due to his age and health conditions, Hartmann was one of only a few Japanese Americans on the West Coast to avoid the [[Internment of Japanese Americans|mass incarceration]] during World War II, although the FBI and local officials visited the ranch often to conduct investigations.<ref name=Densho/>  In 1944, he died while visiting another daughter in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]]. A collection of his papers is held at the University of California, Riverside, including correspondence related to his obtaining permission to remain in Banning during the war.\n\n== Involvement in anarchist movement ==\n\nThe following biography of Sadakichi Hartmann is taken from Paul Avrich's ''The Modern School Movememnt'' from page 134-138\n\n\"Next to [[Hippolyte_Havel|Havel]], the most exotic personality at the [[Ferrer_Center_and_Colony|Ferrer Center]] was Sadakichi Hartmann. Hartmann's father was a German merchant, his mother a Japanese woman who died soon after childbirth, and Sadakichi, according to [[Manuel_Komroff|Manuel Komroff]], \"inherited the worst traits of both races.\" Like Havel, he was an inverterate sponger and drinker (\"a tremendous boozehound,\" to quote Maurice Hollod). Sadakichi in Japanese means \"steady luck,\" or \"fortunate if constant.\" \"The moniker means 'Gimme some dough,'\" quipped [[W._C._Fields|W. C. Fields]], who knew him from his Hollywood years. According to [[John_Barrymore|John Barrymore]], he was \"presumably sired by Mephistopheles out of Madame Butterfly.\"\n\nBorn in Nagasaki in 1867, Sadakichi was sent to Germany to be raised in the household of a wealthy Hamburg uncle, \"among whose books and art treasures,\" he would recall, \"I spent my childhood, and whom I have to thank for my first appreciation of art.\" For his education he was sent to a naval academy at Kiel, but he rebelled against the strict military discipline and ran away to Paris, whereupon his father disinherited him and shipped him off to relations in Philadelphia. Arriving in 1882, he worked at a succession of menial jobs while reading in the library at night. When he learned that Walt Whitman lived across the river in Camden, New Jersey, he visited the aging poet and they fried eggs together, recited verses, and discussed literature and art.\n\nSadakichi emerged as a man of diverse artistic talents, \"poet, writer, painter, and a marvelous reader of the poems and stories of Whitman and Poe,\" as [[Emma_Goldman|Emma Goldman]] describes him. He wrote fiction, drama, poetry, essays, and sketches, half a dozen books and hundreds of articles in the fields of painting and photography, including important studies of Japanese and American art. In the 1880's and '90's he was already informing the American public, in wide range of magazines and newspapers, both in German and English, anout Ibsen and the French Symbolists, and introducing Japanese art and literature to women's clubs of Philadelphia, Boston, and New York. He was probably the first person, according to [[Kenneth_Rexroth|Kenneth Rexroth]], to write English haiku (\"White petals afloat / On a winding woodland stream / What else is life's dream?\"). In 1897 he produced the first psychedelic light show, and in 1902 held his first \"perfume concert.\" He also fave lessons in body language, mostly to \"young women, fascinated by his rakish good looks, restless energy, and courtly manners.\"\n\nEzra Pound, with whom he corresponded, placed him at the head of the lost legion of American avant-garde writers of the fin-de-siecle era, and Alfred Stieglitz considered him one of the best critics of photography in the United States. (He was a regular contributor to Stieglitz's ''Camera Work'', writing as \"Sidney Allan\" when he was not under his own name or initials.)\n\nIn physique Sadakachi was tall and thin - so thin, a friend remarked, that he \"looked as if he only exhaled and never inhaled.\" Immensely photogenic in spite of his rotting teeth, he was incapable of being photographed badly. Thousands of pictures were taken of him, not one without interest. Attractive to women, he sired a dozen children, most of whom he gave the names of flowers or herbs. In 1891 he married Elizabeth Blanche Walsh, the daughter of an English colonel, who bore him five of his children and served as his secretary for many years. Long after he deserted her in 1910, she still spoke of him with loyalty and affection, once saying: \"He was three parts genius and one part devil, and I was in love with all four parts.\"\n\n\"Sadakichi is singular, never plural,\" [[Gertrude_Stein|Gertrude Stein]] remarked. Vain, stubborn, eccentric, he was capable of the most outlandish behaviour. On one occasion, masquerading as a Japanese prince with an escort of costumed companions, he hoodwinked the City of New York into holding a parade down Broadway. \"A grotesque etched in flesh by the drunken Goya of Heaven, wrote [[Benjamin_De_Casseres|Benjamin De Casseres]] of Sadakichi. \"A grinning, obscene gargoyle on the Temple of American Letters. Superman bum. Half Gof, half Hooligan; all artist. Anarch, sadist, satyr. A fusion of Japanese and German, the ghastly experiment of an Occidental on the person of an Oriental. Sublime, ridiculous, impossible. A genius of the ateliers, picture studios, ginmills, and East Side lobscouse restaurants. A dancing dervish, with graceful, Gargantuan feet and a mouth like the Cloaca Maxima. A painter out of Hakusai, Manet, Whistler. Result: fantastic realism. A colosal ironist, a suave pessimist, a Dionysiac Wobbly.\" \n\nIn a philosophical sense at least, Sadakichi was also an anarchist. He called on [[Peter_Kropotkin|Kropotkin]] when the Russian prince visited New York in 1897 on his first lecture tour of America. He attended anarchist meetings, mingled in anarchist circles, was friendly with Goldman and [[Alexander_Berkman|Berkman]], and contributed to [[Mother_Earth_(magazine)|Mother Earth]] and other anarchist publications. Among his pieces was a poem to [[Francisco_Ferrer|Ferrer]], and Tobias Sigel of the Detroit Modern School was his old friend and physician. Regarding life and art as \"the twin flames of revolt,\" he refused to be herded along by prevailing tastes and standards, and he rejected \"stagnant crowd-thinking and mass-meeting morality.\" Unlike Havel, however, he remained on the periphery of the anarchist movement, a sympathizer rather than an activist, too cynical perhaps to believe in a successful libertarian revolution that would inaugurate the stateless millennium. \"I personally do not believe in reform,\" he wrote to a friend. \"Human nature in itself (in all of us) is so beastly and nasty that reform is impossible.\"\n\nFor several years the Ferrer Center was Sadakichi's chief point of contact with the anarchists. \"He fell in love with the Ferrer gang,\" Maurice Hollod recalls, \"for they were the very warp and woof of what he stood for.\" An admirer of Henri and Bellows, he drifted in and out of their art class, \"loaded with fire-water and bacchanalic spirits.\" (On such occasions, of course, work from nude models had to be suspended.)\n\nA gifted reciter and performer, Sadakichi became one of the Center's star attractions. When he opened his mouth to speak, says Manuel Komroff, he was toothless \"except two tusks,\" but he had \"a fine, sonorous voice, which today would be thought too dramatic.\" Apart from declaiming his own verse, he read from Whitman and Poe and [[Amy_Lowell|Amy Lowell]], from [[Leo_Tolstoy|Tolstoy]] and [[Ambrose_Bierce|Ambrose Bierce]]. He staged shadow pictures and perfume concerts, pantomimes and hand dances. \"Nobody danced like Sadakichi,\" was the general verdict.\n\nThe high point, however, arrived when he read from his cycle of symbolist dramas, ''Confucius, Buddha, Christ,'' and ''Mohammed'' (\"providing Sadakichi doesn't change his mind\", the programs warned). When ''Christ'', which [[James_Huneker|James Gibbons Huneker]] pronounced \"absolutely the most daring of all decadent productions,\" was published in Boston in 1893, the work was immediately confiscated and burned, and Sadakichi himself was arrested and spent Christmas week in the Charles Street jail. ''Buddha'', published in 1897, was described by [[Vance_Thompson|Vance Thompson]] as \"strange, gaudy, fantastic - a thing all color and incense; something as gilded and monstrous and uncouth as the temple of Benares.\" When Sadakichi read from ''Christ'' at the Ferrer Center in 1915, Maurice Hollod was in the audience. \"The first night,\" he remembers, \"limousines pulled up with women in fur coats and lorgnettes, things never seen on 107th Street before!

After the audience votes for their favorite performances, the celebrity with the fewest votes is eliminated from the competition and takes off their mask, revealing their identity.<ref>{{cite web|last=Birnbaum|first=Debra|title=Fox Orders ''Masked Singer'' Reality Series; Nick Cannon to Host|url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/fox-masked-singer-reality-series-nick-cannon-1202893337/|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=April 9, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191102132907/https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/fox-masked-singer-reality-series-nick-cannon-1202893337/|archive-date=November 2, 2019|date=August 2, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Stone|first=Natalie|title=''The Masked Singer'' Renewed for Season 3, to Premiere After 2020 Super Bowl|url=https://people.com/tv/the-masked-singer-renewed-for-season-3/|website=[[People (magazine)|People]]|access-date=April 9, 2020|date=May 13, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200220055111/https://people.com/tv/the-masked-singer-renewed-for-season-3/|archive-date=February 20, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"TFC Credits Jan 2019\">{{cite press release|title=Fox Reveals a Second Season of Television's #1 New Show and #1 Unscripted Series, ''The Masked Singer''|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2019/01/30/fox-reveals-a-second-season-of-televisions-number-1-new-show-and-number-1-unscripted-series-the-masked-singer-546112/20190130fox01/|via=[[The Futon Critic]]|publisher=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]|access-date=April 9, 2020|date=January 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe series has been broadcast on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] since January 2, 2019, and has aired three seasons thus far, the first of which was produced by [[Endemol Shine North America]].
