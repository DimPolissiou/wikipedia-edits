The city fielded a team in the [[New York State League (1885\u20131917)|New York State League]] from 1899\u20131917, then was without professional baseball until [[1939 in baseball|1939]], except for one year, [[1924 in baseball|1924]], when the '''Utica Utes,''' a member of an earlier edition of the [[New York\u2013Pennsylvania League (1923\u201337)|New York\u2013Pennsylvania League]], moved to [[Oneonta, New York]], in midseason.\n\n===The first Blue Sox team===\nThe first Blue Sox team can be traced to the  '''Utica Braves''' of the Class C [[Canadian\u2013American League]], formed when the former Auburn Bouleys were moved to Utica by Amby McConnell and Father Harold Martin. The Utica Braves were initially a [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]] [[farm team]] in 1939 and kept the nickname through 1942. The Braves were also affiliated with the [[Detroit Tigers]] in 1941 and the [[Springfield Rifles (baseball)|Springfield Rifles]] in 1942.<ref>{{Cite web|title = 1943 Utica Braves Statistics -- Minor Leagues  {{!}} Baseball-Reference.com|url = https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/team.cgi?id=b7afb2a6|website = Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate = 2015-07-22}}</ref>\n\nIn [[1943 in baseball|1943]], Utica moved up to the Class A [[Eastern League (baseball)|Eastern League]] and became an affiliate of the [[Philadelphia Phillies]]. The nickname Blue Sox dates to [[1944 in baseball|1944]] when their parent team was unofficially called the \"Philadelphia Blue Jays\".  The Blue Sox of the 1940s played in a ballpark in the northern part of the city called McConnell Field, which was named after the team owner and former pro player from Utica.\n\nMany of the Blue Sox players of the 1940s later became the ''Whiz Kids'' of the [[1950 in baseball|1950]] [[National League]] champion  Phillies. \n\nFuture Philadelphia stars such as [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Famer]] [[Richie Ashburn]], who came to Utica as a [[catcher]] but within a month was moved to [[center fielder|center field]] by his [[manager (baseball)|manager]], [[Eddie Sawyer]], to utilize his speed. \n\nOthers, including [[Stan Lopata]] and [[Granny Hamner]], all took the field for both Utica and Philadelphia during the late 1940s.\n\nEddie Sawyer, manager of the Blue Sox in 1945 and 1947 and later for seven more years in Philadelphia, once said, \"We had great ballclubs in a bad ballpark.\" Ashburn recalled  the peculiar way the field was laid out, with center field to the west. \"The sun would set over it\", he once said. \"I never got a hit up there in the first five innings in 150 games, and I still hit .300.\"{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n[[Murnane Field]] was considered one of the worst baseball layouts in the NY-P league with right field sloping downhill drastically by the time it hit the fence.\n\n===Second Blue Sox team===\nThe name Blue Sox was resurrected in the Short-Season A classification [[New York\u2013Penn League]]. \n\nA new NY-P franchise began in 1977 as the Utica Blue Jays, playing at Murnane Field, being the first affiliate in the Toronto Blue Jays organization, from 1977\u20131980. That team included Toronto's first ever draft pick, Tom Goffena. The line up also included future major leaguers Jesse Barfield, David Wells and Paul Hodgson. \n\nToronto withdrew their affiliation after the 1980 season and the club played as an independent, under the name Blue Sox, from 1981 through 1983. The ownership of that team included Miles Wolff (Durham Bulls), actor/writer Brian Doyle Murray and his brother, comedian Bill Murray. Bill Murray sang the national anthem for the Blue Sox 1981 home opener. The independent Utica Blue Sox won the NY-P championship in 1983.\n\nThe team became an affiliate with the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] from 1986\u20131987, the [[Chicago White Sox]] from 1988\u201392 and the [[Boston Red Sox]] from 1993\u20131995. In 1996 the team became affiliated with the [[Florida Marlins]] and were renamed the '''Utica Marlins'''; however, the team was renamed the Blue Sox the very next season. Among the notable players who were once Utica Blue Sox players; Larry Walker, Miguel Cabrera, Adrian Gonzales, Andy Ashby, Jason Grimsley and Esteban Beltre.\n\nBy the end of the 2001 season, the city needed a standard level ball park and Donovan Stadium at Murnane Field was in need of renovations and repairs in order to keep the Blue Sox team in the league. On February 7, 2002, [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]] and  the Ripken Professional Baseball Association purchased the Blue Sox and moved the club to [[Aberdeen, Maryland]], where it became the [[Aberdeen IronBirds]].\n\nFor a time in the late 1980s, [[Morganna|Morganna the Kissing Bandit]] owned a share of the Blue Sox.<ref name=\"York\">{{cite news|last=York|first=Marty|title=Morganna riding the buss to success in the minor leagues|work=The Globe and Mail|date=1989-06-27}}</ref>\n\n==In media==\nAcclaimed author and journalist [[Roger Kahn]] (''The Boys of Summer'') wrote about his year as a part owner of the team for the 1983 championship season.

His father was a renowned inventor<ref>{{Cite patent|title=Fire fighting airplane|gdate=1956-09-22|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US2895693A/en}}</ref> and metallurgist who worked and consulted for aerospace and engineering firms.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2015/06/22/guy-on-a-bike-remembering-cecil-behringer/|title=Guy On A Bike: Remembering Cecil Behringer|date=2015-06-22|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-02}}</ref>  The two collaborated together to create Behringer Bicycles after he convinced Cecil, a champion six day bike racer during the [[Great Depression]], to create modern race bicycles using cutting edge manufacturing methods his father was developing in the mid 1970s.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R9kDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA79&lpg=PA79&dq=cecil+behringer&source=bl&ots=RygouNIpmn&sig=ACfU3U1LqRBGnJwOvi9uje8EPaqqcH-p-w&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjeo7no4bHnAhXVLs0KHVxUD-Q4ChDoATABegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=cecil%20behringer&f=false|title=Popular Mechanics|last=Magazines|first=Hearst|date=July 1982|publisher=Hearst Magazines|language=en}}</ref>  James decided after several years working at Behringer Bicycles to pursue his passion of music. \n\n== Career ==\nHe began his professional career working with the local Minneapolis band, Good Vibrations.  After leaving Good Vibrations, he joined [[Gypsy (band)|The James Walsh Gypsy Band]].  He became the lead guitarist and cowriter for the group, going on to record two albums, including the recently released ''Muscle Shoals'' album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gypsy-queen.net/muscleshoals.html|title=Gypsy - Muscle Shoals|website=www.gypsy-queen.net|access-date=2020-02-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/412304-James-Walsh-Gypsy-Band|title=James Walsh Gypsy Band|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2020-02-02}}</ref>\n\nMoving to Florida after Gypsy disbanded, he was introduced to [[Bobby Caldwell]] by a radio DJ who had heard Behringer's demo tapes.  Caldwell invited him to join in writing his new album and they spent two years recording ''August Moon'', which was critically well received in Japan and went on to receive Gold certification.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn 1984 he was hired to work with the platinum selling artist [[Laura Branigan]] as a guitarist and background singer on her [[Self Control (album)|''Self Control'']] album tour.

Once the Lorber tour was completed Behringer spent some time writing his own songs and built his first home recording studio.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jefflorberfansite.blog29.fc2.com/blog-entry-101.html|title=Jeff Lorber Japanese fansite, by fans, for fans... {{!}}Karyn White performs \"Facts of Love\" with Jeff Lorber (1986)|website=jefflorberfansite.blog29.fc2.com|access-date=2020-02-02}}</ref>\n\nIn 1988, Behringer was hired to perform on tour with the Japanese new age artist [[Kitar\u014d|Kitaro]].

By 1653, though, English and Dutch farmers moved into the area and founded a community called '''Whitepot''', which was a part of the [[Elmhurst, Queens|Township of Newtown]]. Whitepot is believed to be so named because the original Dutch settlers named the area \"Whiteput\", or \"hollow creek\"; later, English settlers Anglicized the name.<ref name=fny/> The Remsen family created a burial ground, which is still located on Alderton Street near Metropolitan Avenue. The colonists also founded the Whitepot School, which operated until the late 19th century.<ref name=fny/>\n\nIn the Hempstead Swamp, which turned out to be good for farming, the colonists cultivated hay, straw, rye, corn, oats, and vegetables.<ref name=fny/> The original Dutch, English, and German farmers sold their produce in Manhattan; by the end of the 19th century, though, Chinese farmers moved in and sold their goods exclusively to Chinatown.<ref name=fny/>\n\nThe settlement was renamed '''Rego Park''' after the Real Good Construction Company, which began development of the area in 1925.<ref name=\"NYTimes.com 1930\"/> \"Rego\" comes from the first two letters of the first two words of the company's name. The company built 525 eight-room houses costing $8,000 each. Stores were built in 1926 on [[Queens Boulevard]] and 63rd Drive, and apartment buildings were built in 1927\u20131928.<ref>{{Cite enc-nyc}}</ref> In 1930, the [[Independent Subway System]] began work on eight [[IND Queens Boulevard Line]] stations in the area, at a cost of $5 million.

Rego Park's boundaries include [[Queens Boulevard]], the [[Interstate 495 (New York)|Long Island Expressway]], [[Woodhaven Boulevard]], and Yellowstone Boulevard. There is a large [[Jewish]] population in the neighborhood, which features high-rise apartment buildings and detached houses, as well as a large commercial zone.\n\nRego Park is located in [[Queens Community Board 6|Queens Community District 6]] and its ZIP Code is 11374.<ref name=\"NYCPlanning\"/> It is patrolled by the [[New York City Police Department]]'s 112th Precinct.<ref name=\"NYPD 112th Precinct\"/> Politically, Rego Park is represented by the [[New York City Council]]'s 29th District and a small part of the 24th and 25th Districts.<ref>[http://www.nyc.gov/html/dc/downloads/pdf/queens.pdf Current City Council Districts for Queens County], [[New York City]]. Accessed May 5, 2017.</ref>\n\n==History==\nRego Park is built on a [[swamp]] called the [[Hempstead Swamp]], which once extended to [[St. John's Cemetery (Queens)|St. John's Cemetery]] in Middle Village. By 1653, though, English and Dutch farmers moved into the area and founded a community called '''Whitepot''', which was a part of the [[Elmhurst, Queens|Township of Newtown]]. Whitepot is believed to be so named because the original Dutch settlers named the area \"Whiteput\", or \"hollow creek\"; later, English settlers Anglicized the name.<ref name=fny/> The Remsen family created a burial ground, which is still located on Alderton Street near Metropolitan Avenue. The colonists also founded the Whitepot School, which operated until the late 19th century.<ref name=fny/>\n\nIn the Hempstead Swamp, which turned out to be good for farming, the colonists cultivated hay, straw, rye, corn, oats, and vegetables.<ref name=fny/> The original Dutch, English, and German farmers sold their produce in Manhattan; by the end of the 19th century, though, Chinese farmers moved in and sold their goods exclusively to Chinatown.<ref name=fny/>\n\nThe settlement was renamed '''Rego Park''' after the Real Good Construction Company, which began development of the area in 1925.<ref name=\"NYTimes.com 1930\"/> \"Rego\" comes from the first two letters of the first two words of the company's name. The company built 525 eight-room houses costing $8,000 each. Stores were built in 1926 on [[Queens Boulevard]] and 63rd Drive, and apartment buildings were built in 1927\u20131928.<ref>{{Cite enc-nyc}}</ref> In 1930, the [[Independent Subway System]] began work on eight [[IND Queens Boulevard Line]] stations in the area, at a cost of $5 million.

Firefighters scrambled to keep the windswept flames from reaching an apartment house behind the stores, a new [[Key Food]] supermarket across Austin Street, or the [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] gas station just across the drive. The library caved in before flames could damage the electrical wires lining the railroad. A new library eventually opened across the street (on the former site of the Shell gas station).

[[Chicago metropolitan area|Chicagoland]], Chicago's [[metropolitan area]], encompasses over 65% of the state's population. The [[Port of Chicago]] connects the state to international ports via two main routes: from the [[Great Lakes]], via the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]], to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and from the [[Great Lakes]] to the [[Mississippi River]], via the [[Illinois Waterway]] to the [[Illinois River]]. The Mississippi River, the [[Ohio River]], and the [[Wabash River]] form parts of the boundaries of Illinois. For decades, Chicago's [[O'Hare International Airport]] has been ranked as one of the world's busiest airports. Illinois has long had a reputation as a [[bellwether]] both in [[Will it play in Peoria?|social and cultural terms]]<ref name=\"so\" /> and, through the 1980s, in [[swing states|politics]].\n\nThe capital of Illinois is [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]], which is located in the central part of the state. Although today Illinois's largest population center is in its northeast, the state's European population grew first in the west as the French settled lands near the Mississippi River, when the region was known as [[Illinois Country]] and was part of [[New France]].

[[Northern Illinois]] is dominated by [[Chicago metropolitan area]], or Chicagoland, which is the city of Chicago and its suburbs, and the adjoining exurban area into which the metropolis is expanding. As defined by the federal government, the Chicago metro area includes several counties in Illinois, [[Indiana]], and [[Wisconsin]], and has a population of over 9.8&nbsp;million. Chicago itself is a cosmopolitan city, densely populated, industrialized, the transportation hub of the nation, and settled by a wide variety of ethnic groups. The city of [[Rockford, Illinois|Rockford]], Illinois's third-largest city and center of the state's fourth largest metropolitan area, sits along Interstates [[Interstate 39|39]] and [[Interstate 90|90]] some {{convert|75|mi|km}} northwest of Chicago. The [[Quad Cities]] region, located along the [[Mississippi River]] in northern Illinois, had a population of 381,342 in 2011.\n\nThe midsection of Illinois is the second major division, called [[Central Illinois]]. It is an area of mainly [[prairie]] and known as the Heart of Illinois. It is characterized by small towns and medium\u2013small cities. The western section (west of the Illinois River) was originally part of the [[Military Tract of 1812]] and forms the conspicuous western bulge of the state. Agriculture, particularly [[maize|corn]] and [[soybean]]s, as well as educational institutions and manufacturing centers, figure prominently in Central Illinois. Cities include [[Peoria, Illinois|Peoria]]; [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]], the state capital; [[Quincy, Illinois|Quincy]]; [[Decatur, Illinois|Decatur]]; [[Bloomington-Normal, Illinois|Bloomington-Normal]]; and [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]]-[[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]].<ref name=\"Nelson\"/>\n\nThe third division is [[Southern Illinois]], comprising the area south of [[U.S. Route 50 in Illinois|U.S. Route 50]], including [[Southern Illinois|Little Egypt]], near the juncture of the [[Mississippi River]] and [[Ohio River]]. Southern Illinois is the site of the ancient city of [[Cahokia]], as well as the site of the first state capital at [[Kaskaskia, Illinois|Kaskaskia]], which today is separated from the rest of the state by the Mississippi River.<ref name=\"Nelson\"/><ref name=\"Horsley\">{{cite book |last=Horsley |first=A.

Bush]] became the first Republican to win the presidency without carrying either Illinois or [[Vermont]]. Local politician and Chicago resident [[Barack Obama]] easily won the state's 21 electoral votes in [[2008 United States presidential election in Illinois|2008]], with 61.9% of the vote. In 2010, incumbent Governor [[Pat Quinn (politician)|Pat Quinn]] was re-elected with 47% of the vote, while Republican Mark Kirk was elected to the Senate with 48% of the vote. In 2012, President Obama easily carried Illinois again, with 58% to Republican candidate [[Mitt Romney]]'s 41%.

In [[2018 Illinois gubernatorial election|2018]], Democrat [[J. B. Pritzker|JB Pritzker]] defeated the incumbent Bruce Rauner for the governorship with 54% of the vote.\n\n===History of corruption===\n\n{{main|Political corruption in Illinois}}\n\nPolitics in the state have been infamous for highly visible corruption cases, as well as for crusading reformers, such as governors [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] and [[James R. Thompson]]. In 2006, former Governor [[George Ryan]] was convicted of racketeering and bribery, leading to a six-and-a-half-year prison sentence. In 2008, then-Governor [[Rod Blagojevich]] was served with a criminal complaint on corruption charges, stemming from allegations that he conspired to sell the vacated Senate seat left by President [[Barack Obama]] to the highest bidder. Subsequently, on December 7, 2011, [[Rod Blagojevich]] was sentenced to 14 years in prison for those charges, as well as perjury while testifying during the case, totaling 18 convictions. Blagojevich was impeached and convicted by the legislature, resulting in his removal from office. In the late 20th century, Congressman [[Dan Rostenkowski]] was imprisoned for mail fraud; former governor and federal judge [[Otto Kerner, Jr.]] was imprisoned for bribery; Secretary of State [[Paul Powell (politician)|Paul Powell]] was investigated and found to have gained great wealth through bribes, and State Auditor of Public Accounts (Comptroller) [[Orville Hodge]] was imprisoned for embezzlement. In 1912, William Lorimer, the GOP boss of Chicago, was expelled from the U.S. Senate for bribery and in 1921, Governor [[Len Small]] was found to have defrauded the state of a million dollars.<ref name=\"Biles\"/><ref name=\"Horsley\"/><ref>{{cite book |title= Grafters and Goo Goos: corruption and reform in Chicago, 1833\u20132003|last= Merriner|first= James L.|year= 2004|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|location= Carbondale|isbn= 978-0-8093-2571-9|oclc= 52720998}}</ref>\n\n===U.S. presidential elections===\n\n{{Main|United States presidential elections in Illinois}}\n\nIllinois has shown a strong presence in presidential elections. Three presidents have claimed Illinois as their political base when running for president: [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Ulysses S. Grant]], and most recently [[Barack Obama]]. Lincoln was born in [[Kentucky]], but he moved to Illinois at age 21. He served in the [[Illinois General Assembly|General Assembly]] and represented the [[Illinois's 7th congressional district|7th congressional district]] in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] before his election to the presidency in 1860. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was born in [[Ohio]] and had a military career that precluded settling down, but on the eve of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and approaching middle age, he moved to Illinois and thus utilized the state as his home and political base when running for President. [[Barack Obama]] was born in [[Hawaii]] and made Illinois his home after graduating from [[law school]], and later represented Illinois in the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]]. He then became president in 2008, running as a candidate from his Illinois base.\n\n[[Ronald Reagan]] was born in Illinois, in the city of [[Tampico, Illinois|Tampico]], raised in [[Dixon, Illinois]], and educated at [[Eureka College]], outside [[Peoria, Illinois|Peoria]]. Reagan later moved to [[California]] during his young adulthood. He then became an actor, and later became [[Governor of California|California's Governor]] before being elected president.\n\n[[Hillary Clinton]] was born and raised in the suburbs of Chicago and became the first woman to represent a major political party in the general election of the U.S. presidency. Clinton ran from a platform based in [[New York (state)|New York State]].\n\n===African-American U.S. senators===\n\n[[List of African-American United States Senators|Nine African-Americans]] have served as members of the [[United States Senate]]. Three of them have represented Illinois, the most of any single state: [[Carol Moseley Braun|Carol Moseley-Braun]], [[Barack Obama]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/history/h_multi_sections_and_teasers/Photo_Exhibit_African_American_Senators.htm |title=U.S. Senate: Art & History Home |publisher=Senate.gov |accessdate=February 7, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180702035451/https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/history/h_multi_sections_and_teasers/Photo_Exhibit_African_American_Senators.htm |archive-date=July 2, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> and [[Roland Burris]], who was appointed to replace Obama after his election to the presidency. Moseley-Braun was the first African-American woman to become a U.S. Senator.\n\n===Political families===\n\nThree families from Illinois have played particularly prominent roles in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], gaining both statewide and national fame.\n\n====Stevenson====\n\nThe [[Stevenson family]], initially rooted in central Illinois and later based in the Chicago metropolitan area, has provided four generations of Illinois officeholders.\n* [[Adlai Stevenson I]] (1835\u20131914) was a Vice President of the United States, as well as a [[Congressman]]\n* [[Lewis Stevenson (politician)|Lewis Stevenson]] (1868\u20131929), son of Adlai, served as [[Illinois Secretary of State]].\n* [[Adlai Stevenson II]] (1900\u20131965), son of Lewis, served as [[Governor of Illinois]] and as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations; he was also the Democratic party's presidential nominee in [[1952 United States presidential election|1952]] and [[1956 United States presidential election|1956]], losing both elections to [[Dwight Eisenhower]].\n* [[Adlai Stevenson III]] (1930\u2013), son of Adlai II, served ten years as a [[United States Senator]].\n\n====Daley====\n\nThe [[Daley family]]'s powerbase was in Chicago.\n* [[Richard J. Daley]] (1902\u20131976) served as [[Mayor of Chicago]] from 1955 to his death.\n* [[Richard M. Daley]] (1942\u2013), son of Richard J, was Chicago's longest-serving mayor, in office from 1989 to 2011.\n* [[William M. Daley]] (1948\u2013), another son of Richard J, is a former [[White House Chief of Staff]] and has served in a variety of appointed positions.\n\n====Pritzker====\n\nThe [[Pritzker family]] is based in Chicago and have played important roles both in the private and public sectors.\n* [[Jay Pritzker]] (1922-1999), co-founder of [[Hyatt Hotel]] based in Chicago.\n* [[Penny Pritzker]] (1959- ), 38th [[United States Secretary of Commerce]] under President [[Barack Obama]].\n* [[J.B. Pritzker]] (1965- ), current and 43rd [[Governor of Illinois]] and co-founder of the Pritzker Group.\n\n==Education==\n===Illinois State Board of education===\n\n{{main|Illinois State Board of Education}}\n\nThe Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE) is autonomous of the governor and the state legislature, and administers [[public education]] in the state. Local municipalities and their respective [[school district]]s operate individual public schools, but the ISBE audits performance of public schools with the [[Illinois School Report Card]]. The ISBE also makes recommendations to state leaders concerning education spending and policies.\n\n===Primary and secondary schools===\n\n{{see also|List of school districts in Illinois|List of high schools in Illinois}}\n\nEducation is compulsory from ages 7 to 17 in Illinois. Schools are commonly, but not exclusively, divided into three tiers of primary and secondary education: elementary school, [[middle school]] or [[Middle school|junior high school]], and high school. District territories are often complex in structure. Many areas in the state are actually located in ''two'' school districts\u2014one for high school, the other for elementary and middle schools. And such districts do not necessarily share boundaries. A given high school may have several elementary districts that feed into it, yet some of those feeder districts may themselves feed into multiple high school districts.\n\n===Colleges and universities===\n\n{{mainlist|List of colleges and universities in Illinois}}\n[[File:MainLibrary Urbana Illinois 4582.jpg|thumb|The [[Main Library (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign)|Main Library]] of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]] is home to [[The Rare Book & Manuscript Library (University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign)|the Rare Book & Manuscript Library]].]]\n\nUsing the criterion established by [[the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching]], there are eleven \"National Universities\" in the state. {{As of|2010|8|19}}, six of these rank in the \"first tier\" (that is, the top quartile) among the top 500 National Universities in the United States, as determined by the ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' rankings: the [[University of Chicago]] (3), [[Northwestern University]] (10), the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]] (41), [[Loyola University Chicago]] (89), the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] (108), [[DePaul University]] (123), [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] (129), [[Illinois State University]] (149), [[Southern Illinois University Carbondale]] (153), and [[Northern Illinois University]] (194).<ref name=\"usnews\">{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/national-universities-rankings/state+IL|title=Best Colleges 2010\u2014National Universities Rankings|date=August 19, 2009|accessdate=May 31, 2016|website=[[U.S. News & World Report]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105090520/http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/national-universities-rankings/state+IL|archive-date=January 5, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe University of Chicago is continuously ranked as one of the world's top ten universities on various independent university rankings, and its [[Booth School of Business]], along with Northwestern's [[Kellogg School of Management]] consistently rank within the top five graduate business schools in the country and top ten globally.

Currently there is trackwork on the Chicago\u2013St. Louis line to bring the maximum speed up to {{convert|110|mph|abbr=on}}, which would reduce the trip time by an hour and a half. Nearly every North American railway meets at Chicago, making it the largest and most active rail hub in the country. Extensive commuter rail is provided in the city proper and some immediate suburbs by the [[Chicago Transit Authority]]'s [[Chicago \"L\"|'L']] system. One of the largest suburban commuter rail system in the United States, operated by [[Metra]], uses existing rail lines to provide direct commuter rail access for hundreds of suburbs to the city and beyond.\n\nIn addition to the state's rail lines, the [[Mississippi River]] and [[Illinois River]] provide major transportation routes for the state's agricultural interests. [[Lake Michigan]] gives Illinois access to the Atlantic Ocean by way of the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]].\n\n====Interstate highway system====\n\n{{Main|List of Interstate Highways in Illinois}}\n\nThe Interstate Highways in Illinois are all segments of the [[Interstate Highway System]] that are owned and maintained by the state.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/interstate/faq.cfm|title=Interstate Frequently Asked Questions\u201450th Anniversary\u2014Interstate System\u2014Highway History\u2014Federal Highway Administration|website=www.fhwa.dot.gov|access-date=May 3, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIllinois has the distinction of having the most primary (two-digit) interstates pass through it among all the 50 states with 13.

The [[Port of Chicago]] connects the state to international ports via two main routes: from the [[Great Lakes]], via the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]], to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and from the [[Great Lakes]] to the [[Mississippi River]], via the [[Illinois Waterway]] to the [[Illinois River]]. The Mississippi River, the [[Ohio River]], and the [[Wabash River]] form parts of the boundaries of Illinois. For decades, Chicago's [[O'Hare International Airport]] has been ranked as one of the world's busiest airports. Illinois has long had a reputation as a [[bellwether]] both in [[Will it play in Peoria?|social and cultural terms]]<ref name=\"so\" /> and, through the 1980s, in [[swing states|politics]].\n\nThe capital of Illinois is [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]], which is located in the central part of the state. Although today Illinois's largest population center is in its northeast, the state's European population grew first in the west as the French settled lands near the Mississippi River, when the region was known as [[Illinois Country]] and was part of [[New France]]. Following the [[American Revolutionary War]], American settlers began arriving from [[Kentucky]] in the 1780s via the Ohio River, and the population grew from south to north. In 1818, Illinois achieved [[List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union|statehood]]. Following increased commercial activity in the Great Lakes after the construction of the [[Erie Canal]], Chicago was founded in the 1830s on the banks of the [[Chicago River]] at one of the few natural harbors on the southern section of [[Lake Michigan]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chipublib.org/digital/lake/CFDHarbor.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516035020/http://www.chipublib.org/digital/lake/CFDHarbor.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 16, 2008|title=Page Not Found\u2014Chicago Public Library|date=May 16, 2008}}</ref> [[John Deere (inventor)|John Deere]]'s invention of the self-scouring [[plough|steel plow]] turned Illinois's rich [[prairie]] into some of the world's most productive and valuable farmland, attracting [[immigrant]] farmers from [[German American|Germany]] and [[Swedish American|Sweden]].

[[Northern Illinois]] is dominated by [[Chicago metropolitan area]], or Chicagoland, which is the city of Chicago and its suburbs, and the adjoining exurban area into which the metropolis is expanding. As defined by the federal government, the Chicago metro area includes several counties in Illinois, [[Indiana]], and [[Wisconsin]], and has a population of over 9.8&nbsp;million. Chicago itself is a cosmopolitan city, densely populated, industrialized, the transportation hub of the nation, and settled by a wide variety of ethnic groups. The city of [[Rockford, Illinois|Rockford]], Illinois's third-largest city and center of the state's fourth largest metropolitan area, sits along Interstates [[Interstate 39|39]] and [[Interstate 90|90]] some {{convert|75|mi|km}} northwest of Chicago. The [[Quad Cities]] region, located along the [[Mississippi River]] in northern Illinois, had a population of 381,342 in 2011.\n\nThe midsection of Illinois is the second major division, called [[Central Illinois]]. It is an area of mainly [[prairie]] and known as the Heart of Illinois. It is characterized by small towns and medium\u2013small cities. The western section (west of the Illinois River) was originally part of the [[Military Tract of 1812]] and forms the conspicuous western bulge of the state. Agriculture, particularly [[maize|corn]] and [[soybean]]s, as well as educational institutions and manufacturing centers, figure prominently in Central Illinois. Cities include [[Peoria, Illinois|Peoria]]; [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]], the state capital; [[Quincy, Illinois|Quincy]]; [[Decatur, Illinois|Decatur]]; [[Bloomington-Normal, Illinois|Bloomington-Normal]]; and [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]]-[[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]].<ref name=\"Nelson\"/>\n\nThe third division is [[Southern Illinois]], comprising the area south of [[U.S. Route 50 in Illinois|U.S. Route 50]], including [[Southern Illinois|Little Egypt]], near the juncture of the [[Mississippi River]] and [[Ohio River]]. Southern Illinois is the site of the ancient city of [[Cahokia]], as well as the site of the first state capital at [[Kaskaskia, Illinois|Kaskaskia]], which today is separated from the rest of the state by the Mississippi River.<ref name=\"Nelson\"/><ref name=\"Horsley\">{{cite book |last=Horsley |first=A.

Bush]] became the first Republican to win the presidency without carrying either Illinois or [[Vermont]]. Local politician and Chicago resident [[Barack Obama]] easily won the state's 21 electoral votes in [[2008 United States presidential election in Illinois|2008]], with 61.9% of the vote. In 2010, incumbent Governor [[Pat Quinn (politician)|Pat Quinn]] was re-elected with 47% of the vote, while Republican Mark Kirk was elected to the Senate with 48% of the vote. In 2012, President Obama easily carried Illinois again, with 58% to Republican candidate [[Mitt Romney]]'s 41%.

In [[2018 Illinois gubernatorial election|2018]], Democrat [[J. B. Pritzker|JB Pritzker]] defeated the incumbent Bruce Rauner for the governorship with 54% of the vote.\n\n===History of corruption===\n\n{{main|Political corruption in Illinois}}\n\nPolitics in the state have been infamous for highly visible corruption cases, as well as for crusading reformers, such as governors [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] and [[James R. Thompson]]. In 2006, former Governor [[George Ryan]] was convicted of racketeering and bribery, leading to a six-and-a-half-year prison sentence. In 2008, then-Governor [[Rod Blagojevich]] was served with a criminal complaint on corruption charges, stemming from allegations that he conspired to sell the vacated Senate seat left by President [[Barack Obama]] to the highest bidder. Subsequently, on December 7, 2011, [[Rod Blagojevich]] was sentenced to 14 years in prison for those charges, as well as perjury while testifying during the case, totaling 18 convictions. Blagojevich was impeached and convicted by the legislature, resulting in his removal from office. In the late 20th century, Congressman [[Dan Rostenkowski]] was imprisoned for mail fraud; former governor and federal judge [[Otto Kerner, Jr.]] was imprisoned for bribery; Secretary of State [[Paul Powell (politician)|Paul Powell]] was investigated and found to have gained great wealth through bribes, and State Auditor of Public Accounts (Comptroller) [[Orville Hodge]] was imprisoned for embezzlement. In 1912, William Lorimer, the GOP boss of Chicago, was expelled from the U.S. Senate for bribery and in 1921, Governor [[Len Small]] was found to have defrauded the state of a million dollars.<ref name=\"Biles\"/><ref name=\"Horsley\"/><ref>{{cite book |title= Grafters and Goo Goos: corruption and reform in Chicago, 1833\u20132003|last= Merriner|first= James L.|year= 2004|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|location= Carbondale|isbn= 978-0-8093-2571-9|oclc= 52720998}}</ref>\n\n===U.S. presidential elections===\n\n{{Main|United States presidential elections in Illinois}}\n\nIllinois has shown a strong presence in presidential elections. Three presidents have claimed Illinois as their political base when running for president: [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Ulysses S. Grant]], and most recently [[Barack Obama]]. Lincoln was born in [[Kentucky]], but he moved to Illinois at age 21. He served in the [[Illinois General Assembly|General Assembly]] and represented the [[Illinois's 7th congressional district|7th congressional district]] in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] before his election to the presidency in 1860. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was born in [[Ohio]] and had a military career that precluded settling down, but on the eve of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and approaching middle age, he moved to Illinois and thus utilized the state as his home and political base when running for President. [[Barack Obama]] was born in [[Hawaii]] and made Illinois his home after graduating from [[law school]], and later represented Illinois in the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]]. He then became president in 2008, running as a candidate from his Illinois base.\n\n[[Ronald Reagan]] was born in Illinois, in the city of [[Tampico, Illinois|Tampico]], raised in [[Dixon, Illinois]], and educated at [[Eureka College]], outside [[Peoria, Illinois|Peoria]]. Reagan later moved to [[California]] during his young adulthood. He then became an actor, and later became [[Governor of California|California's Governor]] before being elected president.\n\n[[Hillary Clinton]] was born and raised in the suburbs of Chicago and became the first woman to represent a major political party in the general election of the U.S. presidency. Clinton ran from a platform based in [[New York (state)|New York State]].\n\n===African-American U.S. senators===\n\n[[List of African-American United States Senators|Nine African-Americans]] have served as members of the [[United States Senate]]. Three of them have represented Illinois, the most of any single state: [[Carol Moseley Braun|Carol Moseley-Braun]], [[Barack Obama]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/history/h_multi_sections_and_teasers/Photo_Exhibit_African_American_Senators.htm |title=U.S. Senate: Art & History Home |publisher=Senate.gov |accessdate=February 7, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180702035451/https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/history/h_multi_sections_and_teasers/Photo_Exhibit_African_American_Senators.htm |archive-date=July 2, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> and [[Roland Burris]], who was appointed to replace Obama after his election to the presidency. Moseley-Braun was the first African-American woman to become a U.S. Senator.\n\n===Political families===\n\nThree families from Illinois have played particularly prominent roles in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], gaining both statewide and national fame.\n\n====Stevenson====\n\nThe [[Stevenson family]], initially rooted in central Illinois and later based in the Chicago metropolitan area, has provided four generations of Illinois officeholders.\n* [[Adlai Stevenson I]] (1835\u20131914) was a Vice President of the United States, as well as a [[Congressman]]\n* [[Lewis Stevenson (politician)|Lewis Stevenson]] (1868\u20131929), son of Adlai, served as [[Illinois Secretary of State]].\n* [[Adlai Stevenson II]] (1900\u20131965), son of Lewis, served as [[Governor of Illinois]] and as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations; he was also the Democratic party's presidential nominee in [[1952 United States presidential election|1952]] and [[1956 United States presidential election|1956]], losing both elections to [[Dwight Eisenhower]].\n* [[Adlai Stevenson III]] (1930\u2013), son of Adlai II, served ten years as a [[United States Senator]].\n\n====Daley====\n\nThe [[Daley family]]'s powerbase was in Chicago.\n* [[Richard J. Daley]] (1902\u20131976) served as [[Mayor of Chicago]] from 1955 to his death.\n* [[Richard M. Daley]] (1942\u2013), son of Richard J, was Chicago's longest-serving mayor, in office from 1989 to 2011.\n* [[William M. Daley]] (1948\u2013), another son of Richard J, is a former [[White House Chief of Staff]] and has served in a variety of appointed positions.\n\n====Pritzker====\n\nThe [[Pritzker family]] is based in Chicago and have played important roles both in the private and public sectors.\n* [[Jay Pritzker]] (1922-1999), co-founder of [[Hyatt Hotel]] based in Chicago.\n* [[Penny Pritzker]] (1959- ), 38th [[United States Secretary of Commerce]] under President [[Barack Obama]].\n* [[J.B. Pritzker]] (1965- ), current and 43rd [[Governor of Illinois]] and co-founder of the Pritzker Group.\n\n==Education==\n===Illinois State Board of education===\n\n{{main|Illinois State Board of Education}}\n\nThe Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE) is autonomous of the governor and the state legislature, and administers [[public education]] in the state. Local municipalities and their respective [[school district]]s operate individual public schools, but the ISBE audits performance of public schools with the [[Illinois School Report Card]]. The ISBE also makes recommendations to state leaders concerning education spending and policies.\n\n===Primary and secondary schools===\n\n{{see also|List of school districts in Illinois|List of high schools in Illinois}}\n\nEducation is compulsory from ages 7 to 17 in Illinois. Schools are commonly, but not exclusively, divided into three tiers of primary and secondary education: elementary school, [[middle school]] or [[Middle school|junior high school]], and high school. District territories are often complex in structure. Many areas in the state are actually located in ''two'' school districts\u2014one for high school, the other for elementary and middle schools. And such districts do not necessarily share boundaries. A given high school may have several elementary districts that feed into it, yet some of those feeder districts may themselves feed into multiple high school districts.\n\n===Colleges and universities===\n\n{{mainlist|List of colleges and universities in Illinois}}\n[[File:MainLibrary Urbana Illinois 4582.jpg|thumb|The [[Main Library (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign)|Main Library]] of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]] is home to [[The Rare Book & Manuscript Library (University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign)|the Rare Book & Manuscript Library]].]]\n\nUsing the criterion established by [[the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching]], there are eleven \"National Universities\" in the state. {{As of|2010|8|19}}, six of these rank in the \"first tier\" (that is, the top quartile) among the top 500 National Universities in the United States, as determined by the ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' rankings: the [[University of Chicago]] (3), [[Northwestern University]] (10), the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]] (41), [[Loyola University Chicago]] (89), the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] (108), [[DePaul University]] (123), [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] (129), [[Illinois State University]] (149), [[Southern Illinois University Carbondale]] (153), and [[Northern Illinois University]] (194).<ref name=\"usnews\">{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/national-universities-rankings/state+IL|title=Best Colleges 2010\u2014National Universities Rankings|date=August 19, 2009|accessdate=May 31, 2016|website=[[U.S. News & World Report]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105090520/http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/national-universities-rankings/state+IL|archive-date=January 5, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe University of Chicago is continuously ranked as one of the world's top ten universities on various independent university rankings, and its [[Booth School of Business]], along with Northwestern's [[Kellogg School of Management]] consistently rank within the top five graduate business schools in the country and top ten globally.

Nearly every North American railway meets at Chicago, making it the largest and most active rail hub in the country. Extensive commuter rail is provided in the city proper and some immediate suburbs by the [[Chicago Transit Authority]]'s [[Chicago \"L\"|'L']] system. One of the largest suburban commuter rail system in the United States, operated by [[Metra]], uses existing rail lines to provide direct commuter rail access for hundreds of suburbs to the city and beyond.\n\nIn addition to the state's rail lines, the [[Mississippi River]] and [[Illinois River]] provide major transportation routes for the state's agricultural interests.

Multiple incomplete but well-preserved specimens were discovered in the [[Gobi Desert]] in the 1970s, and in 1979 the genus and species '''''Segnosaurus galbinensis''''' were named. The generic name ''Segnosaurus'' means \"slow lizard\" and the specific name ''galbinensis'' refers to the [[Galbin]] region. The known material of this dinosaur includes the lower jaw, neck and tail vertebrae, the pelvis, shoulder girdle, and limb bones. Parts of the specimens have gone missing or become damaged since they were collected.\n\n''Segnosaurus'' was a large-bodied [[therizinosaur]] that is estimated to have been about {{convert|6\u20137|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and to have weighed about {{convert|1.3|MT|ST|abbr=on}}. It would have been bipedal, with the trunk of its body tilted upwards. The head was small with a beak at the tip of the jaws, and the neck was long and slender. The lower jaw was down-turned at the front and the teeth were distinct in having additional {{Dinogloss|denticles}} as well as third cutting edges in some of the hindmost teeth. The forelimbs were robust and had three fingers which bore large claws, and the feet had four toes supporting the foot\u2014apart from therizinosaurs, all [[theropods]] had three-toed feet. The front of the pelvis was adapted to support the enlarged belly. The [[pubic bone]] was turned backwards, a feature that is only seen in birds and the dinosaurs most closely related to them.\n\nThe affinities of ''Segnosaurus'' were originally obscure and it received its own theropod family, Segnosauridae, and later when related genera were identified, an [[infraorder]], Segnosauria. Alternative classification schemes were proposed until more complete relatives were described in the 1990s, which confirmed them as theropods. The new fossils also showed Segnosauridae was a [[junior synonym]] of the earlier named family Therizinosauridae. ''Segnosaurus'' and its relatives are thought to have been slow-moving animals that, as indicated by their unusual features, were mainly herbivorous, whereas most other theropod groups were carnivorous. Therizinosaurs probably used their long forelimbs, long necks, and beaks when [[Browsing (herbivory)|browsing]], and large guts for processing food. ''Segnosaurus'' is known from the [[Bayan Shireh Formation]], where it lived alongside the fellow therizinosaurs ''[[Erlikosaurus]]'' and ''[[Enigmosaurus]]''; these related genera were probably [[niche partitioned]].\n\n==History of discovery==\n[[File:Cretaceous-aged dinosaur fossil localities of Mongolia.PNG|thumb|left|upright=1.4|[[Cretaceous]]-aged dinosaur fossil localities of Mongolia; ''Segnosaurus'' was found by areas C and D (right, Amtgay and Khara-Khutul localities)]]\n\nIn 1973, a joint [[Soviet]]\u2013Mongolian expedition investigating the [[Bayan Shireh Formation]] at the Amtgay locality in the [[Gobi Desert]] of southeastern Mongolia discovered fossils that included the partial skeleton of an unknown [[dinosaur]]. Through 1974 and 1975, more remains were uncovered at the Amtgay and Khara-Khutul localities; though the skeletons were incomplete, the recovered bones were well-preserved. Other localities listed in the literature include Bayshin-Tsav and Urilbe-Khuduk. These fossils were scientifically [[species description|described]] in 1979 by the paleontologist [[Altangerel Perle]], who named the new [[genus]] and species ''Segnosaurus galbiensis''. The generic name is derived from the Latin word ''segnis'' (\"slow\") and the [[Ancient Greek]] ''sauros'' (\"lizard\"). The [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] refers to the [[Galbin]] region of the Gobi Desert.<ref name=\"Perle1979\">{{Cite journal |last=Perle |first=A. |author-link=Altangerel Perle |year=1979 |title=Segnosauridae \u2013 novoe semeistvo teropod is posdnego mela Mongolii |trans-title=Segnosauridae \u2013 a new family of Theropoda from the Lower Cretaceous of Mongolia |url=http://paleoglot.org/files/Perle%2079.pdf |url-status=live |journal=Trudy \u2013 Sovmestnaya Sovetsko-Mongol'skaya Paleontologicheskaya Ekspeditsiya |language=Russian |volume=8 |pages=45\u201355 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128221548/http://paleoglot.org/files/Perle%2079.pdf |archive-date=2012-11-28 |translator-last=Siskron |translator-first=C. |translator2-last=Welles |translator2-first=S.

More bones bearing the specimen number IGM 100/82 were located but were not mentioned in Perle's description, while the whereabouts of some paratype elements was unknown.<ref name=\"barsbold1983\">{{Cite journal |last=Barsbold |first=R. |year=1983 |title=Khishchnye dinosavry mela Mongoliy|trans-title=Carnivorous dinosaurs from the Cretaceous of Mongolia |url=https://paleoglot.org/files/Barsbold_83.pdf |url-status=live |journal=Transactions of the Joint Soviet-Mongolian Paleontological Expedition |volume=19 |pages=51\u201352, 76, 108\u2013109 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313031010/http://paleoglot.org/files/barsbold_83.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-13 |access-date=2019-09-21|language=Russian|translator-last=Siskron |translator-first=C. |translator2-last=Welles |translator2-first=S.

The nearly complete right hemimandible (half of the mandible) is {{convert|379|mm|in|abbr=on}} long from front to back, {{convert|55.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} at the highest point, and {{convert|24.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} at the lowest. The {{Dinogloss|dentary bone}}, the tooth-bearing bone forming most of the mandible's front part, was complex in shape compared to those of early therizinosaurs. The tooth-bearing part was almost rectangular and sloped downwards in side view with a pronounced arc throughout the upper length of the front end\u2014more extreme than what is known in other therizinosaurs. The front-most part of the dentary was strongly deflected downwards at about a 30 degree angle, a unique feature for this genus. When each hemimandible is articulated with the other, they form a broadly U-shaped, toothless mandibular symphysis that projects upwards towards the front as in ''Erlikosaurus'' and ''[[Neimongosaurus]]''. The expansive, toothless front region of the dentary spans {{convert|25.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} on the right hemimandible of the holotype. Proportionally, the toothless part of the dentary is 20% of its tooth row, which is {{convert|150.3|mm|in|abbr=on}} long. By comparison, the toothless region of ''Erlikosaurus'' was about 12% of the tooth row's length and was almost absent in ''Jianchangosaurus''. The height of the dentary diminished towards the hindmost extend of the tooth row, whereafter it sharply fanned out to contact the {{Dinogloss|surangular}} bone behind it; by contrast, the hind part of the dentary in ''Erlikosaurus'' gradually approached the surungular in a gentle arc.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\">{{cite journal|last1=Zanno|first1=L.

The teeth were restricted to the front two thirds of the dentary, which bore 24 {{Dinogloss|alveoli}} (tooth sockets) in a manner similar to ''Jianchangosaurus'' but different from ''Erlikosaurus'', in which nearly the entire dentary was toothed, bearing 31 alveoli. The tooth row of ''Segnosaurus'' was inset and demarcated by a shelf on the outer side as it was in all derived (or \"advanced\") therizinosaurs. Unlike in other related taxa, the shelf was restricted to the hind part of the dentary and the raised rim that defined it was not as pronounced. ''Segnosaurus'' was unique in having a low ridge rising between the fifth and fourteenth alveoli that divided the dentary into two almost-equally sized front and hind parts. Just above this ridge, the dentary was pierced by a row of {{Dinogloss|foramina}} as in ''Jianchangosaurus'' and ''[[Alxasaurus]]'', which became less regular by the region around the mandibular symphysis, where the two halves of the mandible met at the front. This row was instead directly in line with and on the side of the ridge in ''Erlikosaurus''. The {{Dinogloss|Meckelian groove}} that ran along the inner side of the mandible, was placed further down than in ''Erlikosaurus'' and had a consistent depth until the thirteenth tooth position, whereafter it widened. The lower jaw elements behind the dentary (the {{Dinogloss|splenial}}, surangular, {{Dinogloss|angular}}, and {{Dinogloss|prearticular}} bones) were distinct from those of other therizinosaurs, being gracile and linear, and contributing to the hind part of the hemimandible being elongate and almost rectangular.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/> The surangular was long and sword-shaped, the angular was wing-like in shape, the prearticular was narrow and curved, and the splenial was thin and triangular in outline. The external mandibular fenestra, an opening at the outer side of the mandible, was larger than that of ''Erlikosaurus'' because the surangular was shallow from top to bottom.<ref name=\"Perle1979\" />\n\n[[File:Mesial dentary teeth of Segnosaurus.png|thumb|upright|Frontmost dentary teeth, showing folded {{Dinogloss|carinae}} (lf) and accessory {{Dinogloss|denticles}} (ad)]]\n''Segnosaurus'' had the fewest teeth in the dentary; 24 in each half determined from the number of sockets, as well as the largest teeth known among therizinosaurs. The dentary teeth were foliodont (leaf-shaped) and bore enlarged, relatively tall, sideways compressed crowns with a slight recurvature at the upper margin of the tips. By comparison, the teeth of ''Erlikosaurus'' were smaller, symmetrical, and simpler. The bases of the crowns increased slightly in size hindwards across the tooth row, which reflected a decrease in sideways compression. The front surfaces of the crowns and outward-facing sides were convex while the inward-facing sides were concave. A thickened ridge ran along the longitude of the inward-facing side near the upper half of the crown, which was flanked by weak grooves near the front and back edges of the teeth, reaching almost to the cervix (neck; the transition between the crown and root) of the teeth. In general, the 18 front-most teeth were relatively homodont (of the same type), though the crown of the second tooth was relatively shorter and more tapered; this may also have been true for the first tooth, but it was not preserved. The teeth further back in the row also decreased in relative height hindwards. By comparison, the front four to five dentary teeth of ''Erlikosaurus'' were conidont (cone-shaped) with a gradual transition to foliodont teeth.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/><ref name=\"Perle1979\" />\n\nThe dentary teeth were tightly packed, but not pressed closely together, with the tooth crowns approaching each other at mid-length. The {{Dinogloss|denticles}} (serrations) were large and bulbous, diminishing slightly in size towards the tooth tips, with about 5\u20136 denticles per {{convert|3|mm|in|abbr=on}}. The front {{Dinogloss|carinae}} (cutting edges) folded upwards to overlap the inner surface of the crowns on the third to eighteenth teeth, but such folds were absent on the second and probably first crowns. The denticles were roughly perpendicular with the tip of the tooth crowns, but parallel to the crown height on the front side fold and triangular facet on the hind side. There was a series of accessory denticles (in addition to those on the carinae) that projected from the front surfaces of the carinal folds, which made the front edges of the crowns more broadly roughened. The carinae of the hind edges were also very modified, and bifurcated (split in two) near the cervix, where they formed a flattened triangular, raised facet, which projected from the tooth crown and contacted or approached the folded carinae on the front edge of the crowns behind them (this arrangement is present in teeth 2\u201312). Such split carinae are known from other [[tetanuran]] theropods, where they are considered abnormalities caused by trauma, aberrant [[tooth replacement]], or genetic factors. Though the condition in ''Segnosaurus'' was similar, it was uniformly expressed across the teeth of both dentaries, and does not appear to have been an abnormality, but served to roughen the contacts between tooth bases.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/>\n\nThe 22nd and 23rd dentary teeth of ''Segnosaurus'' were significantly smaller than the rest, almost conidont, and had an additional third carina with denticles on their inner sides. Most of the other hindmost tooth crowns are damaged so their complete features are unknown. The additional carina on tooth 23 appears to have been fully denticulated while the denticles were restricted to the basal side of the crown in tooth 22. ''Segnosaurus'' was unique among all known theropods in possessing triple carinae. The 14th alveolus on the right dentary of the holotype is walled over by seemingly [[pathological]] (due to injury or disease) bone growth but the teeth in that part of the dentary are damaged so it is not possible to determine how the teeth were affected by this. The teeth in the same area of the left dentary bear triple carinae, though this dentary has no external indications of pathology that could have led to this condition, thus it cannot be concluded nor ruled out that this feature is the result of a pathology. ''Segnosaurus'' [[Polyphyodont|replaced its teeth]] in waves running from back to front of the jaws, that encompassed two to three erupting crowns. Some of the fully erupted teeth have wear on the carinae of their hind sides, unlike what is seen in other therizinosaurs. The texture of the {{Dinogloss|enamel}} appears to have been broadly irregular and the roots of the teeth were almost circular.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/>\n\n===Postcranial skeleton===\n[[File:Segno.jpg|thumb|[[paleoart|Life restoration]]]]\n\nThe {{Dinogloss|scapula}} (shoulder blade) of ''Segnosaurus'' was straight and flat at the upper end, and was fused to the coracoid bone, forming the scapulocoracoid. The coracoid was very wide, rectangular in outline, and thick at the middle. The massive humerus was {{convert|560|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length; it had an almost-cylindrical shaft and well-defined condyles for articulation with the radius and ulna of the lower arm. The deltopectoral crest, where the [[deltoid muscle]] was attached to the upper front of the humerus, was well-developed.<ref name=Perle1979/> The humerus was distinct from those of other therizinosaurs, being straight rather than [[sigmoid shaped]] and not expanded or deflected forwards at its upper end. The humerus was also not expanded at the middle, and the [[entepicondyle]] was not well-developed. The lack of these features was more similar to [[ornithomimosaurs]] and [[troodontids]] than to other therizinosaurs.<ref name=Zanno2010/> The radius was also massive\u2014about 60 percent of the humerus\u2014with a straight shaft. The ulna was thicker than the radius and slightly longer\u2014about 70 percent of the humerus\u2014and slightly twisted along its middle axis. The hand was [[tridactyl]] (three-fingered). The {{Dinogloss|phalanx bones}} of the fingers were flattened from top to bottom and the articular depressions on their sides were not very developed. The first phalanx of the first finger was long and thin while the first and second phalanxes of the second finger were short. The ungual of the third finger was somewhat longer than the second phalanx and quite flat from top to bottom, which may have been a unique feature of ''Segnosaurus''. This ungual was sharpy curved, very pointed, and compressed from side to side. The lower tubercle, where the flexor tendons attached to the ungual, was thick and robust.<ref name=Perle1979/><ref name=Zanno2010/><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /><ref name=\"Dinosauria2\">{{cite book| last1 = Clark | first1 = J.

Some features of the pelvis were similar to that of ''[[Nothronychus]]'', particularly the ischia, but it is uncertain whether these similarities were due to them having a common ancestor to the exclusion of other derived therizinosaurids, or because they retained basal features since lost in other relatives. The ischium of ''Segnosaurus'' was distinct from that of ''Nothronychus'' in that it had an almost-rectangular obturator process and an almost-circular obturator foramen. The pelvis was distinct from that of ''[[Enigmosaurus]]'' by its deep obturator process not fusing with its counterpart at the middle, by its unfused pubic boot, and because the lower part of the pubic shaft was wide from front to back. ''Segnosaurus'' was distinct from both ''Nothronychus'' and ''Enigmosaurus'' in having a deep {{Dinogloss|brevis fossa}} (a groove where the [[caudofemoralis brevis muscle]] of the tail originated) and because its pubic boot lacked a well developed hindwards projection.<ref name=Zanno2010/>\n\nThe femur was straight with an oval cross-section and was {{convert|840|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length. The head of the femur was placed on a long \"neck\" and the lower condyles were well-defined. The tibia was straight, slightly shorter than the femur, and twisted along its axis. The fibula was long and narrowed towards its lower end. The metatarsus of the foot was short, massive, and consisted of five bones\u2014four of which functioned as support elements and terminated in four toes. Functionally tetradactyl (four-toed) feet were unique to derived therizinosaurs; basal therizinosaurs and all other theropods had tridactyl feet in which the first toe was short and did not reach the ground. Externally, the metatarsus was similar to, though proportionally larger than, those of [[prosauropods]], an early [[evolutionary grade]] of [[sauropodomorphs]]. The epiphyses on the upper metatarsals were hypertrophied (enlarged), a distinctive feature of the genus. The first toe was shorter than the others but was of equal functional importance; the second and third toes were equally long while the fourth was thinnest. The toe ungual was robust, sharply curved, flat at the side, and more pointed than those of prosauropods. The lower tubercle where the flexor ligaments attached was robust. While the lack of strong compression of the toe unguals distinguished ''Segnosaurus'' from ''Erlikosaurus'' from the same formation, the lack of compression was common among therizinosaurs and therefore not unique to ''Segnosaurus''.<ref name=Perle1979/><ref name=Zanno2010/><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /> The cervical vertebrae were platycoelous and had large, massive centra (bodies) and low neural arches. The sacrum consisted of six, firmly fused  vertebrae; the centra of these vertebrae were broadened and relatively elongated, and each centrum was slightly longer than their width. The neural spines here were not very long but surpassed the level of the ilia. The caudal (tail) vertebrae closest to the body were massive, high, and somewhat compressed from side to side. The neural arch was low with a small neural canal. The caudal vertebrae closer to the tip of the tail were platycoelous and had short, massive centra. The transverse processes of the caudal vertebrae and the ribs were robust and elongated.<ref name=Perle1979/><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" />\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:Erlikosaurus skull and foot.jpg|thumb|Skull and foot bones of ''[[Erlikosaurus]]'', which together with ''Segnosaurus'' (both from Mongolia) became the basis of the new [[infraorder]] Segnosauria; this group is now a [[junior synonym]] of [[Therizinosauria]]]]\n\n''Segnosaurus'' and its relatives, which are now recognized as therizinosaurs (\"scythe reptiles\"), were long considered an enigmatic group.

He tentatively classified Segnosauridae as theropods, traditionally thought of as the \"meat-eating\" dinosaurs, pointing to similarities in the mandible and its front teeth. Using features of their humeri and hand claws, he distinguished Segnosauridae from the theropod families [[Deinocheiridae]] and Therizinosauridae, which were then only known from the genera ''[[Deinocheirus]]'' and ''Therizinosaurus'', respectively, mainly represented by large forelimbs found in Mongolia.<ref name=Perle1979/> Later in 1979, Barsbold and Perle found the pelvic features of segnosaurids and dromaeosaurids were so different from those of \"true\" theropods that they should be separated into three taxa of the same rank, possibly at the level of [[infraorder]] within [[Saurischia]], one of the two main divisions of dinosaurs\u2014the other being [[Ornithischia]].<ref name=\"Barsbold&Perle1979\" />\n\nIn 1980, Barsbold and Perle named the new theropod infraorder Segnosauria, containing only Segnosauridae. In the same article, they named the new genus ''Erlikosaurus'' (known from a well-preserved skull and partial skeleton)\u2014which they tentatively considered a segnosaurid\u2014and reported a partial pelvis of an undetermined segnosaurian, both from the same formation as ''Segnosaurus''. The specimens provided relatively complete data on this group; they were united by their opisthopubic pelvis, slender mandible, and the toothless front of their jaws. Barsbold and Perle stated that, though some of their features resembled those of ornithischians and sauropods, these similarities were superficial and distinct when examined in detail. While they were essentially different from other theropods\u2014perhaps due to diverging from them relatively early\u2014and warranted a new infraorder, they did show similarities with the theropods. Because the ''Erlikosaurus'' specimen lacked a pelvis, the authors were unsure that the undetermined segnosaurian could belong to the same genus, in which case they would consider it part of a separate family.<ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /> Though ''Erlikosaurus'' was difficult to compare directly to ''Segnosaurus'' because its remains were incomplete, Perle stated in 1981 there was no justification for separating it into another family.<ref name=Perle1981>{{cite journal | last=Perle | first=A. |author-link=Altangerel Perle |year=1981 |title=Noviy segnozavrid iz verchnego mela Mongolii |journal=Trudy \u2013 Sovmestnaya Sovetsko-Mongol'skaya Paleontologicheskaya Ekspeditsiya |volume=15 |pages=50\u201359|language=Russian|trans-title=New Segnosauridae from the Upper Cretaceous of Mongolia|translator-last=Siskron |translator-first=C. |translator2-last=Welles |translator2-first=S.

He found segnosaurs to be similar to prosauropods in the morphology of their snout, mandible, and hindfoot; to ornithischians in their cheek, palate, pubis, and ankle; and to early dinosaurs in other respects.

In this way, he considered segnosaurians to have a comparable position to herbivorous dinosaurs in general, as [[monotremes]] have to mammals.

While ''Alxasaurus'' was similar in some respects to prosauropods, the detailed morphology of its limbs linked it to ''Therizinosaurus'' and segnosaurs. Because its fore and hindlimbs were preserved, ''Alxasaurus'' showed that Perle's assignment of segnosaurian hindlimbs to ''Therizinosaurus'' was probably correct. Russell and Dong therefore proposed that Segnosauridae was a [[junior synonym]] of the older name Therizinosauridae, and that ''Alxasaurus'' was the most completely known representative so far. They also named the new higher taxonomic rank [[Therizinosauroidea]] to contain ''Alxasaurus'' and Therizinosauridae because the new genus was somewhat different from its relatives. They concluded that therizinosaurs were tetanuran theropods, most closely related to ornithomimids, troodontids, and oviraptorids, which they placed together in the group [[Oviraptorosauria]] (because they found [[Maniraptora]]\u2014the conventional grouping of these\u2014invalid, and the higher level taxonomy of theropods was in flux).<ref name=\"Alxasaurus\">{{cite journal |last1=Russell |first1=D.

The eggs were found in a single [[stratigraphic layer]], suggesting the dinosaurs nested at the site on a single occasion and did not exhibit [[site fidelity]] (always returning to the same site to breed).<ref name=\"MongoliaEggs\">{{cite journal |title=First record of a dinosaur nesting colony from Mongolia reveals nesting behavior of therizinosauroids |journal=Hokkaido University |url=https://www.global.hokudai.ac.jp/blog/first-record-of-a-dinosaur-nesting-colony-from-mongolia-reveals-nesting-behavior-of-therizinosauroids/ |access-date=2019-12-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191221194650/https://www.global.hokudai.ac.jp/blog/first-record-of-a-dinosaur-nesting-colony-from-mongolia-reveals-nesting-behavior-of-therizinosauroids/ |archive-date=2019-12-21 |url-status=live |date=2013}}</ref>\n\n===Diet and feeding===\n[[File:Therizinosaurian mandibular morphology.png|thumb|left|Right half of the holotype mandible shown from the inner side (A), the top (C), and bottom (D), and the left half shown from the inner side (B), compared with the mandibles of other therizinosaurs (to scale in lower right)]]\n\nThe unusual features of therizinosaurs have led to several interpretations of their feeding behavior; there is no direct evidence of their diet, such as stomach contents and feeding traces. In 1970, [[Anatoly K. Rozhdestvensky]] suggested ''Therizinosaurus''\u2014the only member of the group known at the time\u2014used its large claws to open [[termite mounds]] or gather fruits from trees.<ref name=\"Dinosauria2\"/> Barsbold and Perle pointed out in 1979 and 1980 that their peculiar features probably reflected a different evolutionary direction than those of more typical theropods, many of which were considered effective, active predators. Their delicate jaws, small, weak teeth and beaks, and short, compact feet indicated they would not have used the armaments of other theropods to procure food, but could have preyed on fish.<ref name=\"Barsbold&Perle1979\" /><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /> In 1983, Barsbold said the horny beak at the front of the jaws and weakened teeth at the back were common features among herbivorous dinosaurs but not of carnivorous theropods, and speculated this might indicate segnosaurs had shifted to herbivory.<ref name=barsbold1983/> In 1984, Paul suggested they were herbivorous due to the similarities of their skulls to those of prosauropod and ornithischian dinosaurs, which include horny beaks, inset rows of teeth, and a shelf at the side of the jaws that indicated the presence of cheeks. Like ornithischians, they could therefore crop, manipulate, and chew plants in a sophisticated manner. He also suggested the ilia of the pelvis had sideways-flaring blades at the front similar to those of sauropods to support a large gut that was used to ferment and process food.<ref name=\"Paul1984\"/> Norman stated in 1985 the possibility ''Segnosaurus'' was an aquatic fish eater could explain its small, pointed teeth and broad and perhaps webbed feet, but found it mysterious why it should have a horny beak.<ref name=\"DBN85\"/>\n\n[[File:Erliansaurus bellamanus.jpg|thumb|Restoration of ''[[Erliansaurus]]'' in a \"sitting\" pose that therizinosaurs may have employed during feeding]]\nIn 1993, Russell and Dong considered the small size of the head, blunt beaks and large body weights of therizinosaurs consistent with herbivory.<ref name=\"Alxasaurus\"/> In 1993 and 1997, Russell suggested therizinosaurs would have \"sat\" on their pelvises and supported their bodies on their hind limbs while using their long arms, claws, and flexible necks to reach leaves from trees and bushes with their beaks. They could have reached even higher while standing and browsing bipedally. This parallels the way some herbivorous mammals use their forelimbs to manipulate vegetation; Russell considered the extinct [[chalicotheres]] and [[ground sloth]]s, as well as [[gorilla]]s, adaptively convergent with therizinosaurs. Because therizinosaur remains are often found in [[sediments]] deposited in river and lake environments, Russell said they may have browsed on [[riparian]] bushes and trees.<ref name=Russell1997>{{cite book |last=Russell |first=D.

He found this consistent with Rozhdestvensky's suggestion that therizinosaurs may have fed on [[social insects]].<ref name=\"Nessov\" /> In a 2006 conference abstract, Sara Burch presented the inferred range of motion in the arms of the therizinosaur ''Neimongosaurus'' and concluded the overall motion at the {{Dinogloss|glenoid}}-humeral joint at the shoulder was roughly circular, and directed sideways and slightly downwards, which diverged from the more oval, backwards-and-downwards-directed ranges of other theropods. This ability to extend their arms considerably forwards may have helped therizinosars reach and grasp for foliage.<ref name=\"burch2006\">{{Cite conference |last=Burch |first=S. |year=2006 |title=The range of motion of the glenohumeral joint of the therizinosaur ''Neimongosaurus yangi'' (Dinosauria: Theropoda) |conference=Chicago Biological Investigator |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=20}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Zanno and colleagues stated therizinosaurs were the most-widely regarded candidates for herbivory among theropods and listed features associated with this diet. These included small, densely packed, coarse serrations; lanceolate (lance-shaped) teeth with a low replacement rate; a beak at the front of the jaws; an inset tooth row that suggests fleshy cheeks; an elongated neck; a small skull; a very large gut capacity as indicated by the rib circumference at the trunk and the outwards flaring processes of the ilia; and the loss of [[cursorial]] (related to running) adaptations in the hind limbs, including development of functionally tetradactyl feet. Zanno and colleagues found the clades at the base of Maniraptora\u2014Ornithomimosauria, Therizinosauria, and Oviraptorosauria\u2014had either direct or morphological evidence for herbivory, which would mean either this diet evolved independently multiple times in coelurosaurian theropods or that the primitive condition of the group was at least facultative herbivory with carnivory only emerging in more derived maniraptorans.<ref name=\"Zanno2009\">{{cite journal |last1=Zanno |first1=L.

In genera where both neck and forelimb elements are preserved, however, the necks were equal in length or longer than the forelimbs, so pulling vegetation would only make sense if lower parts of long branches were pulled down to access out-of-reach parts of trees.<ref name=\"Claws\"/>\n\n[[File:Dentary teeth of Segnosaurus.png|thumb|upright|Hindmost dentary teeth showing the third cutting edge (lc), unique to ''Segnosaurus'' among theropods]]\nZanno and colleagues stated in 2016 that therizinosaurs were generally accepted to fall within the spectrum of [[omnivory]] and herbivory, with a trend towards intensified herbivory. While various anatomical features have been used to support this idea, tooth morphology had been considered relatively simplistic and with few unique specializations compared to other herbivorous dinosaurs. The few modifications include the increased symmetry in the teeth of ''Erlikosaurus'' and the enlargement of denticles in ''Segnosaurus''. Zanno and collegaues identified novel, complex features in the dentary teeth of ''Segnosaurus'', including the presence of additional carinae and folded carinae with denticulated front edges, which indicate ''Segnosaurus'' had a higher degree of oral food processing than other therizinosaurs. These traits together created a roughened, shredding surface near the base of the tooth crowns that was unique to ''Segnosaurus'' and suggest it consumed unique food resources or used highly specialized feeding strategies. Because multiple geological formations show evidence of [[sympatric]] therizinosaur species\u2014related species that lived in the same area at the same time\u2014it is possible [[niche partitioning]] between them could have played a role in the group's evolutionary success. This is supported by ''Segnosaurus'' with its highly specialized dentition being a contemporary of ''Erlikosaurus'' with its relatively indistinct teeth, indicating their partitioning in food acquisition, processing, or resources. This conclusion is also strengthened by the large difference in estimated body masses of sympatric therizinosaurs in the Bayan Shireh Formation, which was up to 500%.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/>\n\nIn a 2017 study of niche partitioning in therizinosaurs through digital simulations, Lautenschlager found the dentaries of ''Segnosaurus'' experienced one of the lowest stress magnitudes during extrinsic feeding scenarios. ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' were aided by the down-turned tip of the lower jaws and symphyseal regions, and probably also by beaks, which are known to mitigate stress and strain. By contrast, the straighter and more elongated dentaries of basal therizinosaurs\u2014typical of their coelurosaurian ancestors\u2014had the highest magnitudes of stress and strain. A downwards-pulling motion of the head while gripping vegetation was more likely than a sideways or upwards movement, though such behavior would be more likely in ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' with their stress-mitigating jaws. Difference in relative bite force between the sympatric ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' show the former would have been able to feed on tougher vegetation while the overall robustness of the latter suggests greater flexibility in its manner of feeding, because stress levels stayed low across feeding simulations. Lautenschlager agreed the two taxa were adapted to different modes of feeding and food selection; ''Segnosaurus'' was more adapted to using its dentition to procure or process food while ''Erlikosaurus'' mostly used its beak for cropping and its neck musculature while foraging. The difference in size between ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' (the former of which is estimated to have weighed more than the latter) indicates these effects were increased and that there were further mechanisms partitioning their resources, such as different heights. Because other therizinosaur taxa were more divided in time and space, other factors than competition within their group may also have contributed to their variation, such as adaptations to different flora and competition with other kinds of herbivores.<ref name=\"Niche\">{{cite journal |last1=Lautenschlager |first1=S. |title=Functional niche partitioning in Therizinosauria provides new insights into the evolution of theropod herbivory |journal=Palaeontology |date=2017 |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=375\u2013387 |doi=10.1111/pala.12289|url=http://pure-oai.bham.ac.uk/ws/files/39402933/FUNCTIONAL_NICHE_PARTITIONING_IN_THERIZINOSAURIA_REVISED2.pdf }}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Loredana Macaluso and colleagues pointed out that the hips of therizinosaurs were peculiar because the shaft of the pubic bone was rotated backwards whereas the pubic boot was strongly projected forwards. While the larger gut associated with herbivory was able to push the shaft backwards, they suggested the pubic boot was restrained by [[ventilatory muscles]] that were crucial for cuirassal ventilation\u2014breathing with extra [[air sacs]]\u2014which shows the importance of this mode of respiration.<ref name=\"Macaluso\">{{cite journal |last1=Macaluso |first1=L. |last2=Tschopp |first2=E. |last3=Mannion |first3=P. |title=Evolutionary changes in pubic orientation in dinosaurs are more strongly correlated with the ventilation system than with herbivory |journal=Palaeontology |date=2018 |volume=61 |issue=5 |pages=703\u2013719 |doi=10.1111/pala.12362}}</ref> In a 2019 study of jaw musculature, Ali Nabavizadeh concluded therizinosaurs were mainly orthal feeders\u2014moving their jaws up and down\u2014and raised their jaws isognathously whereby the upper and lower teeth of each side [[Occlusion (dentistry)|occluded]] (contacted each other) at once.

Multiple incomplete but well-preserved specimens were discovered in the [[Gobi Desert]] in the 1970s, and in 1979 the genus and species '''''Segnosaurus galbinensis''''' were named. The generic name ''Segnosaurus'' means \"slow lizard\" and the specific name ''galbinensis'' refers to the [[Galbin]] region. The known material of this dinosaur includes the lower jaw, neck and tail vertebrae, the pelvis, shoulder girdle, and limb bones. Parts of the specimens have gone missing or become damaged since they were collected.\n\n''Segnosaurus'' was a large-bodied [[therizinosaur]] that is estimated to have been about {{convert|6\u20137|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and to have weighed about {{convert|1.3|MT|ST|abbr=on}}. It would have been bipedal, with the trunk of its body tilted upwards. The head was small with a beak at the tip of the jaws, and the neck was long and slender. The lower jaw was down-turned at the front and the teeth were distinct in having additional {{Dinogloss|denticles}} as well as third cutting edges in some of the hindmost teeth. The forelimbs were robust and had three fingers which bore large claws, and the feet had four toes supporting the foot\u2014apart from therizinosaurs, all [[theropods]] had three-toed feet. The front of the pelvis was adapted to support the enlarged belly. The [[pubic bone]] was turned backwards, a feature that is only seen in birds and the dinosaurs most closely related to them.\n\nThe affinities of ''Segnosaurus'' were originally obscure and it received its own theropod family, Segnosauridae, and later when related genera were identified, an [[infraorder]], Segnosauria. Alternative classification schemes were proposed until more complete relatives were described in the 1990s, which confirmed them as theropods. The new fossils also showed Segnosauridae was a [[junior synonym]] of the earlier named family Therizinosauridae. ''Segnosaurus'' and its relatives are thought to have been slow-moving animals that, as indicated by their unusual features, were mainly herbivorous, whereas most other theropod groups were carnivorous. Therizinosaurs probably used their long forelimbs, long necks, and beaks when [[Browsing (herbivory)|browsing]], and large guts for processing food. ''Segnosaurus'' is known from the [[Bayan Shireh Formation]], where it lived alongside the fellow therizinosaurs ''[[Erlikosaurus]]'' and ''[[Enigmosaurus]]''; these related genera were probably [[niche partitioned]].\n\n==History of discovery==\n[[File:Cretaceous-aged dinosaur fossil localities of Mongolia.PNG|thumb|left|upright=1.4|[[Cretaceous]]-aged dinosaur fossil localities of Mongolia; ''Segnosaurus'' was found by areas C and D (right, Amtgay and Khara-Khutul localities)]]\n\nIn 1973, a joint [[Soviet]]\u2013Mongolian expedition investigating the [[Bayan Shireh Formation]] at the Amtgay locality in the [[Gobi Desert]] of southeastern Mongolia discovered fossils that included the partial skeleton of an unknown [[dinosaur]]. Through 1974 and 1975, more remains were uncovered at the Amtgay and Khara-Khutul localities; though the skeletons were incomplete, the recovered bones were well-preserved. Other localities listed in the literature include Bayshin-Tsav and Urilbe-Khuduk. These fossils were scientifically [[species description|described]] in 1979 by the paleontologist [[Altangerel Perle]], who named the new [[genus]] and species ''Segnosaurus galbiensis''. The generic name is derived from the Latin word ''segnis'' (\"slow\") and the [[Ancient Greek]] ''sauros'' (\"lizard\").

The nearly complete right hemimandible (half of the mandible) is {{convert|379|mm|in|abbr=on}} long from front to back, {{convert|55.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} at the highest point, and {{convert|24.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} at the lowest. The {{Dinogloss|dentary bone}}, the tooth-bearing bone forming most of the mandible's front part, was complex in shape compared to those of early therizinosaurs. The tooth-bearing part was almost rectangular and sloped downwards in side view with a pronounced arc throughout the upper length of the front end\u2014more extreme than what is known in other therizinosaurs. The front-most part of the dentary was strongly deflected downwards at about a 30 degree angle, a unique feature for this genus. When each hemimandible is articulated with the other, they form a broadly U-shaped, toothless mandibular symphysis that projects upwards towards the front as in ''Erlikosaurus'' and ''[[Neimongosaurus]]''. The expansive, toothless front region of the dentary spans {{convert|25.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} on the right hemimandible of the holotype. Proportionally, the toothless part of the dentary is 20% of its tooth row, which is {{convert|150.3|mm|in|abbr=on}} long. By comparison, the toothless region of ''Erlikosaurus'' was about 12% of the tooth row's length and was almost absent in ''Jianchangosaurus''. The height of the dentary diminished towards the hindmost extend of the tooth row, whereafter it sharply fanned out to contact the {{Dinogloss|surangular}} bone behind it; by contrast, the hind part of the dentary in ''Erlikosaurus'' gradually approached the surungular in a gentle arc.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\">{{cite journal|last1=Zanno|first1=L.

The teeth were restricted to the front two thirds of the dentary, which bore 24 {{Dinogloss|alveoli}} (tooth sockets) in a manner similar to ''Jianchangosaurus'' but different from ''Erlikosaurus'', in which nearly the entire dentary was toothed, bearing 31 alveoli. The tooth row of ''Segnosaurus'' was inset and demarcated by a shelf on the outer side as it was in all derived (or \"advanced\") therizinosaurs. Unlike in other related taxa, the shelf was restricted to the hind part of the dentary and the raised rim that defined it was not as pronounced. ''Segnosaurus'' was unique in having a low ridge rising between the fifth and fourteenth alveoli that divided the dentary into two almost-equally sized front and hind parts. Just above this ridge, the dentary was pierced by a row of {{Dinogloss|foramina}} as in ''Jianchangosaurus'' and ''[[Alxasaurus]]'', which became less regular by the region around the mandibular symphysis, where the two halves of the mandible met at the front. This row was instead directly in line with and on the side of the ridge in ''Erlikosaurus''. The {{Dinogloss|Meckelian groove}} that ran along the inner side of the mandible, was placed further down than in ''Erlikosaurus'' and had a consistent depth until the thirteenth tooth position, whereafter it widened. The lower jaw elements behind the dentary (the {{Dinogloss|splenial}}, surangular, {{Dinogloss|angular}}, and {{Dinogloss|prearticular}} bones) were distinct from those of other therizinosaurs, being gracile and linear, and contributing to the hind part of the hemimandible being elongate and almost rectangular.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/> The surangular was long and sword-shaped, the angular was wing-like in shape, the prearticular was narrow and curved, and the splenial was thin and triangular in outline. The external mandibular fenestra, an opening at the outer side of the mandible, was larger than that of ''Erlikosaurus'' because the surangular was shallow from top to bottom.<ref name=\"Perle1979\" />\n\n[[File:Mesial dentary teeth of Segnosaurus.png|thumb|upright|Frontmost dentary teeth, showing folded {{Dinogloss|carinae}} (lf) and accessory {{Dinogloss|denticles}} (ad)]]\n''Segnosaurus'' had the fewest teeth in the dentary; 24 in each half determined from the number of sockets, as well as the largest teeth known among therizinosaurs. The dentary teeth were foliodont (leaf-shaped) and bore enlarged, relatively tall, sideways compressed crowns with a slight recurvature at the upper margin of the tips. By comparison, the teeth of ''Erlikosaurus'' were smaller, symmetrical, and simpler. The bases of the crowns increased slightly in size hindwards across the tooth row, which reflected a decrease in sideways compression. The front surfaces of the crowns and outward-facing sides were convex while the inward-facing sides were concave. A thickened ridge ran along the longitude of the inward-facing side near the upper half of the crown, which was flanked by weak grooves near the front and back edges of the teeth, reaching almost to the cervix (neck; the transition between the crown and root) of the teeth. In general, the 18 front-most teeth were relatively homodont (of the same type), though the crown of the second tooth was relatively shorter and more tapered; this may also have been true for the first tooth, but it was not preserved. The teeth further back in the row also decreased in relative height hindwards. By comparison, the front four to five dentary teeth of ''Erlikosaurus'' were conidont (cone-shaped) with a gradual transition to foliodont teeth.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/><ref name=\"Perle1979\" />\n\nThe dentary teeth were tightly packed, but not pressed closely together, with the tooth crowns approaching each other at mid-length. The {{Dinogloss|denticles}} (serrations) were large and bulbous, diminishing slightly in size towards the tooth tips, with about 5\u20136 denticles per {{convert|3|mm|in|abbr=on}}. The front {{Dinogloss|carinae}} (cutting edges) folded upwards to overlap the inner surface of the crowns on the third to eighteenth teeth, but such folds were absent on the second and probably first crowns. The denticles were roughly perpendicular with the tip of the tooth crowns, but parallel to the crown height on the front side fold and triangular facet on the hind side. There was a series of accessory denticles (in addition to those on the carinae) that projected from the front surfaces of the carinal folds, which made the front edges of the crowns more broadly roughened. The carinae of the hind edges were also very modified, and bifurcated (split in two) near the cervix, where they formed a flattened triangular, raised facet, which projected from the tooth crown and contacted or approached the folded carinae on the front edge of the crowns behind them (this arrangement is present in teeth 2\u201312). Such split carinae are known from other [[tetanuran]] theropods, where they are considered abnormalities caused by trauma, aberrant [[tooth replacement]], or genetic factors. Though the condition in ''Segnosaurus'' was similar, it was uniformly expressed across the teeth of both dentaries, and does not appear to have been an abnormality, but served to roughen the contacts between tooth bases.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/>\n\nThe 22nd and 23rd dentary teeth of ''Segnosaurus'' were significantly smaller than the rest, almost conidont, and had an additional third carina with denticles on their inner sides. Most of the other hindmost tooth crowns are damaged so their complete features are unknown. The additional carina on tooth 23 appears to have been fully denticulated while the denticles were restricted to the basal side of the crown in tooth 22. ''Segnosaurus'' was unique among all known theropods in possessing triple carinae. The 14th alveolus on the right dentary of the holotype is walled over by seemingly [[pathological]] (due to injury or disease) bone growth but the teeth in that part of the dentary are damaged so it is not possible to determine how the teeth were affected by this. The teeth in the same area of the left dentary bear triple carinae, though this dentary has no external indications of pathology that could have led to this condition, thus it cannot be concluded nor ruled out that this feature is the result of a pathology. ''Segnosaurus'' [[Polyphyodont|replaced its teeth]] in waves running from back to front of the jaws, that encompassed two to three erupting crowns. Some of the fully erupted teeth have wear on the carinae of their hind sides, unlike what is seen in other therizinosaurs. The texture of the {{Dinogloss|enamel}} appears to have been broadly irregular and the roots of the teeth were almost circular.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/>\n\n===Postcranial skeleton===\n[[File:Segno.jpg|thumb|[[paleoart|Life restoration]]]]\n\nThe {{Dinogloss|scapula}} (shoulder blade) of ''Segnosaurus'' was straight and flat at the upper end, and was fused to the coracoid bone, forming the scapulocoracoid. The coracoid was very wide, rectangular in outline, and thick at the middle. The massive humerus was {{convert|560|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length; it had an almost-cylindrical shaft and well-defined condyles for articulation with the radius and ulna of the lower arm. The deltopectoral crest, where the [[deltoid muscle]] was attached to the upper front of the humerus, was well-developed.<ref name=Perle1979/> The humerus was distinct from those of other therizinosaurs, being straight rather than [[sigmoid shaped]] and not expanded or deflected forwards at its upper end. The humerus was also not expanded at the middle, and the [[entepicondyle]] was not well-developed. The lack of these features was more similar to [[ornithomimosaurs]] and [[troodontids]] than to other therizinosaurs.<ref name=Zanno2010/> The radius was also massive\u2014about 60 percent of the humerus\u2014with a straight shaft. The ulna was thicker than the radius and slightly longer\u2014about 70 percent of the humerus\u2014and slightly twisted along its middle axis. The hand was [[tridactyl]] (three-fingered). The {{Dinogloss|phalanx bones}} of the fingers were flattened from top to bottom and the articular depressions on their sides were not very developed. The first phalanx of the first finger was long and thin while the first and second phalanxes of the second finger were short. The ungual of the third finger was somewhat longer than the second phalanx and quite flat from top to bottom, which may have been a unique feature of ''Segnosaurus''. This ungual was sharpy curved, very pointed, and compressed from side to side. The lower tubercle, where the flexor tendons attached to the ungual, was thick and robust.<ref name=Perle1979/><ref name=Zanno2010/><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /><ref name=\"Dinosauria2\">{{cite book| last1 = Clark | first1 = J.

Some features of the pelvis were similar to that of ''[[Nothronychus]]'', particularly the ischia, but it is uncertain whether these similarities were due to them having a common ancestor to the exclusion of other derived therizinosaurids, or because they retained basal features since lost in other relatives. The ischium of ''Segnosaurus'' was distinct from that of ''Nothronychus'' in that it had an almost-rectangular obturator process and an almost-circular obturator foramen. The pelvis was distinct from that of ''[[Enigmosaurus]]'' by its deep obturator process not fusing with its counterpart at the middle, by its unfused pubic boot, and because the lower part of the pubic shaft was wide from front to back. ''Segnosaurus'' was distinct from both ''Nothronychus'' and ''Enigmosaurus'' in having a deep {{Dinogloss|brevis fossa}} (a groove where the [[caudofemoralis brevis muscle]] of the tail originated) and because its pubic boot lacked a well developed hindwards projection.<ref name=Zanno2010/>\n\nThe femur was straight with an oval cross-section and was {{convert|840|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length. The head of the femur was placed on a long \"neck\" and the lower condyles were well-defined. The tibia was straight, slightly shorter than the femur, and twisted along its axis. The fibula was long and narrowed towards its lower end. The metatarsus of the foot was short, massive, and consisted of five bones\u2014four of which functioned as support elements and terminated in four toes. Functionally tetradactyl (four-toed) feet were unique to derived therizinosaurs; basal therizinosaurs and all other theropods had tridactyl feet in which the first toe was short and did not reach the ground. Externally, the metatarsus was similar to, though proportionally larger than, those of [[prosauropods]], an early [[evolutionary grade]] of [[sauropodomorphs]]. The epiphyses on the upper metatarsals were hypertrophied (enlarged), a distinctive feature of the genus. The first toe was shorter than the others but was of equal functional importance; the second and third toes were equally long while the fourth was thinnest. The toe ungual was robust, sharply curved, flat at the side, and more pointed than those of prosauropods. The lower tubercle where the flexor ligaments attached was robust. While the lack of strong compression of the toe unguals distinguished ''Segnosaurus'' from ''Erlikosaurus'' from the same formation, the lack of compression was common among therizinosaurs and therefore not unique to ''Segnosaurus''.<ref name=Perle1979/><ref name=Zanno2010/><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /> The cervical vertebrae were platycoelous and had large, massive centra (bodies) and low neural arches. The sacrum consisted of six, firmly fused  vertebrae; the centra of these vertebrae were broadened and relatively elongated, and each centrum was slightly longer than their width. The neural spines here were not very long but surpassed the level of the ilia. The caudal (tail) vertebrae closest to the body were massive, high, and somewhat compressed from side to side. The neural arch was low with a small neural canal. The caudal vertebrae closer to the tip of the tail were platycoelous and had short, massive centra. The transverse processes of the caudal vertebrae and the ribs were robust and elongated.<ref name=Perle1979/><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" />\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:Erlikosaurus skull and foot.jpg|thumb|Skull and foot bones of ''[[Erlikosaurus]]'', which together with ''Segnosaurus'' (both from Mongolia) became the basis of the new [[infraorder]] Segnosauria; this group is now a [[junior synonym]] of [[Therizinosauria]]]]\n\n''Segnosaurus'' and its relatives, which are now recognized as therizinosaurs (\"scythe reptiles\"), were long considered an enigmatic group.

Using features of their humeri and hand claws, he distinguished Segnosauridae from the theropod families [[Deinocheiridae]] and Therizinosauridae, which were then only known from the genera ''[[Deinocheirus]]'' and ''Therizinosaurus'', respectively, mainly represented by large forelimbs found in Mongolia.<ref name=Perle1979/> Later in 1979, Barsbold and Perle found the pelvic features of segnosaurids and dromaeosaurids were so different from those of \"true\" theropods that they should be separated into three taxa of the same rank, possibly at the level of [[infraorder]] within [[Saurischia]], one of the two main divisions of dinosaurs\u2014the other being [[Ornithischia]].<ref name=\"Barsbold&Perle1979\" />\n\nIn 1980, Barsbold and Perle named the new theropod infraorder Segnosauria, containing only Segnosauridae. In the same article, they named the new genus ''Erlikosaurus'' (known from a well-preserved skull and partial skeleton)\u2014which they tentatively considered a segnosaurid\u2014and reported a partial pelvis of an undetermined segnosaurian, both from the same formation as ''Segnosaurus''. The specimens provided relatively complete data on this group; they were united by their opisthopubic pelvis, slender mandible, and the toothless front of their jaws. Barsbold and Perle stated that, though some of their features resembled those of ornithischians and sauropods, these similarities were superficial and distinct when examined in detail. While they were essentially different from other theropods\u2014perhaps due to diverging from them relatively early\u2014and warranted a new infraorder, they did show similarities with the theropods. Because the ''Erlikosaurus'' specimen lacked a pelvis, the authors were unsure that the undetermined segnosaurian could belong to the same genus, in which case they would consider it part of a separate family.<ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /> Though ''Erlikosaurus'' was difficult to compare directly to ''Segnosaurus'' because its remains were incomplete, Perle stated in 1981 there was no justification for separating it into another family.<ref name=Perle1981>{{cite journal | last=Perle | first=A. |author-link=Altangerel Perle |year=1981 |title=Noviy segnozavrid iz verchnego mela Mongolii |journal=Trudy \u2013 Sovmestnaya Sovetsko-Mongol'skaya Paleontologicheskaya Ekspeditsiya |volume=15 |pages=50\u201359|language=Russian|trans-title=New Segnosauridae from the Upper Cretaceous of Mongolia|translator-last=Siskron |translator-first=C. |translator2-last=Welles |translator2-first=S.

While ''Alxasaurus'' was similar in some respects to prosauropods, the detailed morphology of its limbs linked it to ''Therizinosaurus'' and segnosaurs. Because its fore and hindlimbs were preserved, ''Alxasaurus'' showed that Perle's assignment of segnosaurian hindlimbs to ''Therizinosaurus'' was probably correct. Russell and Dong therefore proposed that Segnosauridae was a [[junior synonym]] of the older name Therizinosauridae, and that ''Alxasaurus'' was the most completely known representative so far. They also named the new higher taxonomic rank [[Therizinosauroidea]] to contain ''Alxasaurus'' and Therizinosauridae because the new genus was somewhat different from its relatives. They concluded that therizinosaurs were tetanuran theropods, most closely related to ornithomimids, troodontids, and oviraptorids, which they placed together in the group [[Oviraptorosauria]] (because they found [[Maniraptora]]\u2014the conventional grouping of these\u2014invalid, and the higher level taxonomy of theropods was in flux).<ref name=\"Alxasaurus\">{{cite journal |last1=Russell |first1=D.

In 1970, [[Anatoly K. Rozhdestvensky]] suggested ''Therizinosaurus''\u2014the only member of the group known at the time\u2014used its large claws to open [[termite mounds]] or gather fruits from trees.<ref name=\"Dinosauria2\"/> Barsbold and Perle pointed out in 1979 and 1980 that their peculiar features probably reflected a different evolutionary direction than those of more typical theropods, many of which were considered effective, active predators. Their delicate jaws, small, weak teeth and beaks, and short, compact feet indicated they would not have used the armaments of other theropods to procure food, but could have preyed on fish.<ref name=\"Barsbold&Perle1979\" /><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /> In 1983, Barsbold said the horny beak at the front of the jaws and weakened teeth at the back were common features among herbivorous dinosaurs but not of carnivorous theropods, and speculated this might indicate segnosaurs had shifted to herbivory.<ref name=barsbold1983/> In 1984, Paul suggested they were herbivorous due to the similarities of their skulls to those of prosauropod and ornithischian dinosaurs, which include horny beaks, inset rows of teeth, and a shelf at the side of the jaws that indicated the presence of cheeks. Like ornithischians, they could therefore crop, manipulate, and chew plants in a sophisticated manner. He also suggested the ilia of the pelvis had sideways-flaring blades at the front similar to those of sauropods to support a large gut that was used to ferment and process food.<ref name=\"Paul1984\"/> Norman stated in 1985 the possibility ''Segnosaurus'' was an aquatic fish eater could explain its small, pointed teeth and broad and perhaps webbed feet, but found it mysterious why it should have a horny beak.<ref name=\"DBN85\"/>\n\n[[File:Erliansaurus bellamanus.jpg|thumb|Restoration of ''[[Erliansaurus]]'' in a \"sitting\" pose that therizinosaurs may have employed during feeding]]\nIn 1993, Russell and Dong considered the small size of the head, blunt beaks and large body weights of therizinosaurs consistent with herbivory.<ref name=\"Alxasaurus\"/> In 1993 and 1997, Russell suggested therizinosaurs would have \"sat\" on their pelvises and supported their bodies on their hind limbs while using their long arms, claws, and flexible necks to reach leaves from trees and bushes with their beaks. They could have reached even higher while standing and browsing bipedally. This parallels the way some herbivorous mammals use their forelimbs to manipulate vegetation; Russell considered the extinct [[chalicotheres]] and [[ground sloth]]s, as well as [[gorilla]]s, adaptively convergent with therizinosaurs.

Zanno and colleagues found the clades at the base of Maniraptora\u2014Ornithomimosauria, Therizinosauria, and Oviraptorosauria\u2014had either direct or morphological evidence for herbivory, which would mean either this diet evolved independently multiple times in coelurosaurian theropods or that the primitive condition of the group was at least facultative herbivory with carnivory only emerging in more derived maniraptorans.<ref name=\"Zanno2009\">{{cite journal |last1=Zanno |first1=L.

In genera where both neck and forelimb elements are preserved, however, the necks were equal in length or longer than the forelimbs, so pulling vegetation would only make sense if lower parts of long branches were pulled down to access out-of-reach parts of trees.<ref name=\"Claws\"/>\n\n[[File:Dentary teeth of Segnosaurus.png|thumb|upright|Hindmost dentary teeth showing the third cutting edge (lc), unique to ''Segnosaurus'' among theropods]]\nZanno and colleagues stated in 2016 that therizinosaurs were generally accepted to fall within the spectrum of [[omnivory]] and herbivory, with a trend towards intensified herbivory. While various anatomical features have been used to support this idea, tooth morphology had been considered relatively simplistic and with few unique specializations compared to other herbivorous dinosaurs. The few modifications include the increased symmetry in the teeth of ''Erlikosaurus'' and the enlargement of denticles in ''Segnosaurus''. Zanno and collegaues identified novel, complex features in the dentary teeth of ''Segnosaurus'', including the presence of additional carinae and folded carinae with denticulated front edges, which indicate ''Segnosaurus'' had a higher degree of oral food processing than other therizinosaurs. These traits together created a roughened, shredding surface near the base of the tooth crowns that was unique to ''Segnosaurus'' and suggest it consumed unique food resources or used highly specialized feeding strategies. Because multiple geological formations show evidence of [[sympatric]] therizinosaur species\u2014related species that lived in the same area at the same time\u2014it is possible [[niche partitioning]] between them could have played a role in the group's evolutionary success. This is supported by ''Segnosaurus'' with its highly specialized dentition being a contemporary of ''Erlikosaurus'' with its relatively indistinct teeth, indicating their partitioning in food acquisition, processing, or resources. This conclusion is also strengthened by the large difference in estimated body masses of sympatric therizinosaurs in the Bayan Shireh Formation, which was up to 500%.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/>\n\nIn a 2017 study of niche partitioning in therizinosaurs through digital simulations, Lautenschlager found the dentaries of ''Segnosaurus'' experienced one of the lowest stress magnitudes during extrinsic feeding scenarios. ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' were aided by the down-turned tip of the lower jaws and symphyseal regions, and probably also by beaks, which are known to mitigate stress and strain. By contrast, the straighter and more elongated dentaries of basal therizinosaurs\u2014typical of their coelurosaurian ancestors\u2014had the highest magnitudes of stress and strain. A downwards-pulling motion of the head while gripping vegetation was more likely than a sideways or upwards movement, though such behavior would be more likely in ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' with their stress-mitigating jaws. Difference in relative bite force between the sympatric ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' show the former would have been able to feed on tougher vegetation while the overall robustness of the latter suggests greater flexibility in its manner of feeding, because stress levels stayed low across feeding simulations. Lautenschlager agreed the two taxa were adapted to different modes of feeding and food selection; ''Segnosaurus'' was more adapted to using its dentition to procure or process food while ''Erlikosaurus'' mostly used its beak for cropping and its neck musculature while foraging. The difference in size between ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' (the former of which is estimated to have weighed more than the latter) indicates these effects were increased and that there were further mechanisms partitioning their resources, such as different heights. Because other therizinosaur taxa were more divided in time and space, other factors than competition within their group may also have contributed to their variation, such as adaptations to different flora and competition with other kinds of herbivores.<ref name=\"Niche\">{{cite journal |last1=Lautenschlager |first1=S. |title=Functional niche partitioning in Therizinosauria provides new insights into the evolution of theropod herbivory |journal=Palaeontology |date=2017 |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=375\u2013387 |doi=10.1111/pala.12289|url=http://pure-oai.bham.ac.uk/ws/files/39402933/FUNCTIONAL_NICHE_PARTITIONING_IN_THERIZINOSAURIA_REVISED2.pdf }}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Loredana Macaluso and colleagues pointed out that the hips of therizinosaurs were peculiar because the shaft of the pubic bone was rotated backwards whereas the pubic boot was strongly projected forwards.

The syndicate expanded over years to include other members of the Adams' Irish family and close childhood friends.

MI5, in a unique inter-departmental collaboration the first of its kind after the [[Cold War]] ended, played a leading part in the electronic war against organised crime\u2014and turned its sights on Adams's international criminal cartel.

He, for example, was allegedly caught on tape, in 1998, telling his adviser Solly Nahome that he did not want to be involved with a particular illegal deal, which would affect his legitimate business. The Inland Revenue was suspicious enough to ask Adams to explain how he had amassed his personal fortune including his \u00a32 million house and his collection of valuable antiques.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Adams invented a range of unlikely occupations, including jeweller and public relations executive.

At trial he was also ordered to pay an unprecedented \u00a36 million criminal assets embargo, or face an additional five years' imprisonment on top of his seven-year term. On appeal the criminal assets embargo was later reduced by appeal judges to \u00a31m largely due to the CPS not having sufficient material evidence, bank accounts or traceable assets to locate and verify Adams' criminal wealth.
