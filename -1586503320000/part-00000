A very kind hearted, good natured fellow who is always there when needed. One of his dreams is to fly. With the help of his friend Dr. Cecil, he tries again and again to fly, and eventually is told that the reason he can't is because ducks became too terrestrial. Bill's main appearance difference, apart from his smallness, is his bow tie which he changes every year at the Ducktown Picnic. Bill lives in an apartment with his pet [[Blue-and-yellow macaw|parrot]], Jerry. He's been called a \"gator lover\" for his rare efforts to turn alligators into allies of Ducktown.\n*'''Aldo''' ([[Dave Ward (voice actor)|Dave Ward]]) \u2013 A lumbering but kind-hearted [[American alligator|alligator]] from the town of Swampwood. He's Bill's best friend, though he often receives grief from his fellow gators on being a \"duck lover\". Has a blind Uncle Artie and a baby cousin Andy. Once was the cook at the bowling ball factory, he transferred to the assembly line after he befriended Bill, as he didn't want to cook any more ducks. He also fights urges so won't eat ducks. \n*'''Bev''' ([[Kathleen Barr]]) \u2013 Owner of the Decoy Cafe, where many ducks go to eat. She's a sweet duck who also has an alias, Madam Bevousky, as whom she offers [[fortune telling]] services to the residents of Ducktown. She is also the focus of Bill's romantic interests.\n*'''Ed, Oly and Waddle''' ([[Louis Chirillo]], [[Phil Hayes (actor)|Phil Hayes]] and [[Jay Brazeau]]) \u2013 Three brothers and friends of Bill who live next door to him. These three goofy & lazy freeloaders are similar to [[the Three Stooges]] and tend to scheme their way into things and are usually the ones behind some prank or plot, from which they always try to distance themselves when things go awry. Ed wears a tropical shirt and speaks with a [[New York (state)|New York]] [[accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]]. Oly wears a green [[beret]], has big, soft feathers (as seen in \"Fowl Weather Feathers\") and speaks with a \"[[beatnik]]\" accent. Waddle is the shortest and fattest and has a more childlike voice.\n*'''Cecil''' ([[Ian James Corlett]]) \u2013 Ducktown's only [[dentist]] and an [[inventor]], Cecil speaks with a [[British English|British]] accent and is always there to offer advice to Bill or the others. Naturally, Aldo is typically his only customer, being the only person in town who actually has teeth. He also provides beak adjustments for the ducks. \n*'''Claire''' \u2013 Cecil's wife who was scared of alligators, just like Aldo in the first episode.\n*'''Fred''' ([[Phil Hayes (actor)|Phil Hayes]]) \u2013 a melancholy, but sometimes nervously hyper [[Adelie penguin|penguin]], who migrated from [[Antarctica]] to Ducktown (possibly to get away from the [[killer whales]] & [[leopard seals]]), in which he has a citizenship. He's somewhat of a loner most of the time, always seen surrounding himself with bags of ice or air conditioning to remain comfortable in the intolerable (to him) heat. Has a duck girlfriend, Dot Cable, and a fashionable cousin, Gelata.\n*'''Raoul''' ([[Michael Benyaer]]) \u2013 A [[Hispanic]] [[crow]] who tends to be the freeloading troublemaker in Ducktown, and likes trading insults with Bill. He especially enjoys mocking Bill's attempts to fly.\n*'''Drill Sergeant Duck''' ([[Cathy Weseluck]]) \u2013 A tough police duck who makes it hard for Aldo to come into Ducktown, as she also is the leader of the ''Duck Defense League,'' an anti-gator organization.\n*Other characters that have appeared in the show have been voiced by [[Dale Wilson (actor)|Dale Wilson]], [[Brian Dobson (actor)|Brian Dobson]], [[Sylvia Zaradic]], [[Chantal Strand]], [[Chiara Zanni]], [[Pauline Newstone]], [[Paul Dobson (actor)|Paul Dobson]], [[Lee Tockar]], [[Garry Chalk (actor)|Garry Chalk]], [[Jay Brazeau]], and [[Scott McNeil]].\n\n==Merchandise==\n''Sitting Ducks'' proved to be a big hit with the European children's show market, and as a result toys, clothing and other merchandise were created.

Their bodies were similar to the modern gray sharks, but the shape of the teeth is strikingly similar to that of a tiger shark. The teeth are numerous, relatively small, with a curved crown and serrated, up to 2.5 \u2013 3&nbsp;cm in height (the only representative of the Mesozoic [[Lamniformes]] with serrated teeth). Large numbers of fossil [[Tooth|teeth]] have been found in Europe, North Africa, and North America.{{citationneeded|date=February 2019}}\n\n''Squalicorax'' was a coastal [[predator]], but also [[Scavenger|scavenged]] as evidenced by a ''Squalicorax'' tooth found embedded in the [[metatarsal]] (foot) bone of a terrestrial [[hadrosaurid]] [[dinosaur]] that most likely died on land and ended up in the water.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/3515295|jstor=3515295|title=Scavenging by Sharks of the Genus Squalicorax in the Late Cretaceous of North America|journal=PALAIOS|volume=12|issue=1|pages=71\u201383|year=1997|last1=Schwimmer|first1=David R.|last2=Stewart|first2=J.

Its length reached almost 3 m. It lived during the [[Cenomanian]] to early [[Santonian]] ([[Campanian]]). Complete skeletons are known from sediments of the Western Inland Sea of the [[Cretaceous]] in Kansas, South Dakota, and Wyoming, all in the USA. The teeth are also found in France, the Czech Republic, Canada, and Morocco. Given the small teeth, this species is considered a hunter of small prey. However, teeth marks on the bones of marine reptiles are evidence that these shark also fed on carrion. The body shape and structure of the trunk [[placoid scale]]s indicate the ability to swim quickly. A fully articulated  1.9-m long [[fossil]] skeleton of ''Squalicorax falcatus'' has been found in Kansas, evidence of its presence in the [[Western Interior Seaway]].\n* ''Squalicorax kaupi'' (Agassiz, 1843) is from the late Santonian to the late [[Maastrichtian]] of North America, New Zealand, Japan, Africa, Europe, Kazakhstan, Jordan. and other places. It  was slightly larger than the preceding species, of which it was probably an ancestor.\n* ''Squalicorax pristodontus'' (Agassiz, 1843) is the largest species, more than 5 m long. From the size of its largest known teeth, it can be estimated that ''S. pristodontus'' grew to 5&nbsp;m (16.5&nbsp;ft) in length. It lived during the late Campanian to early Maastrichtian of North America, France, the Netherlands, Egypt, Morocco, and Madagascar. The relatively complete remains (vertebrae and fragments of jaws) have been found in marine sediments in North America. It is the species with the largest teeth, these teeth being loosely spaced and relatively very large in comparison with other species. In this genus of sharks, studies have shown no precise correlation between the size of the teeth and the length of the body. They could eat relatively large prey and carrion.\n* ''Squalicorax volgensis'' - the oldest species of the genus, from the Early Cretaceous of the Volga \u2013 has been described by L. Glickman ''et al.'' in 1971. The teeth of this species had virtually no serration. They are known from the [[Albian]] to the [[Turonian]] Age in Eastern and Western Europe, as well as Texas.\n\nThe world's largest and most complete semiarticulated fossil of ''Squalicorax'' was  found in 2014 in stores of the Canadian Fossil Discovery Centre in [[Morden, Manitoba]], in Canada, where it is now displayed.

Each day, the genies grant Leah three wishes, but they often make mistakes. Each episode features Leah working together with the genies to resolve the problems they unintentionally cause, all while keeping Shimmer and Shine a secret from her next door neighbor and best friend Zac.\n\nIn the second season, the characters are transported to Zahramay Falls, a magical land where Shimmer and Shine live. Leah reveals her genies' existence to Zac, who is given a genie of his own, named Kaz. Shimmer and Shine continue to grant Leah wishes in Zahramay Falls and befriend the sovereign of the land, Princess Samira. The season includes Samira's pet peacock, Roya and Leah's pet fox, Parisa. Also, Zeta, a villainous sorceress, and finally, Zeta's dragon, Nazboo.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Shimmer and Shine episodes}}\n{{:List of Shimmer and Shine episodes}}\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Humans and genies===\n*Shimmer (voiced by [[Eva Bella]] in US, and [[Mia Wiltshire]] in UK) \u2013 An optimistic genie with blue eyes and pink hair. She is enthusiastic and encouraging. She loves cleaning, glitter, and collecting genie bottles. Her pet is a [[gibbon monkey]] named Tala.\n*Shine (voiced by [[Isabella Cramp]] in US, [[Elie Simons]] and [[Mia Hope]] in UK) \u2013 A courageous genie with purple eyes and blue hair. She is an animal lover and is often hungry. Her pet is a [[Bengal tiger]] cub named Nahal. Due to her love of animals, she is very knowledgeable about the behaviors of magical creatures native to Zahramay Falls. Unlike her sister, she hates cleaning. A running gag involves Shine saying \"It's like I always say...\" only to humorously reveal that she has just made up whatever she says next.\n*Leah (voiced by [[Alina Foley]] in US, and [[Claudia Burns]] in UK) \u2013 A blonde girl with green eyes who owns a genie bottle necklace, which includes Shimmer and Shine.<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Sweetest Thing |minutes=3 |series=Shimmer and Shine |quote=Boom Zahramay! Your best friends are on the way.}}</ref> Although Shimmer and Shine usually mess up her wishes, Leah is patient and forgiving with them. Originally, she was forced to keep her genies' existence a secret from her close friend Zac, but revealed her secret to him after being transported to Zahramay Falls. In the second season, Princess Samira grants Leah and Zac's wish to visit Zahramay Falls whenever they want. While visiting her genies in Zahramay Falls, Leah magically dons a genie disguise in order to blend in, as humans are normally not allowed in Zahramay Falls.\n*Zac (voiced by [[Blake Bertrand]] in the first two seasons, [[Justin Felbinger]], and later [[Ethan Jones]] in season three and onward in US, and [[Innis Robertson-Pinnel]] in UK) \u2013 Leah's neighbor with red hair and blue eyes, and best human friend. In the first season, he is oblivious to the fact that Leah has genies. Whenever something strange or unusual happens, he responds to it in a carefree manner. He also has a habit of telling humorous experiences he has had to Leah. In the second season, he learns that Leah has genies and gets a genie of his own named Kaz.\n*Princess Samira (voiced by [[Nikki SooHoo]] in US, and [[Cariad Lloyd]] in UK) \u2013 The ruler of Zahramay Falls with violet eyes and ice blue hair with darker blue tips, who is in charge of checking up on all the genies in training. She can grant wishes along with the younger genies. She occasionally rewards genies with magic Genie Gems that can have a variety of magical effects. She acts as Shimmer and Shine's mentor and teacher. Despite Zeta being her self-proclaimed rival, Samira likes Zeta and is willing to give her a second chance at becoming a genie-in-training, which in season three is revealed to be due to her past friendship with Zeta when they were both students under Empress Caliana and hopes that Zeta and her can one day become friends again.\n*Zeta the Sorceress (voiced by [[Lacey Chabert]] in US & UK) \u2013 A resident of Zahramay Falls with green eyes and purple hair, who is Princess Samira's rival and wishes to replace her as the most powerful person in Zahramay Falls. Zeta is a sorceress instead of a genie, as she has no desire to grant the wishes of others, relying on magic potions and magical items. Her plans are almost always thwarted by Shimmer, Shine, and Leah. However, her own arrogance and ignorance can cause her to foil her own schemes as well. Despite the trouble she causes, the girls and Zac don't hold it against her and generally try to be friendly towards her when not foiling her schemes. Though she tends to be antagonistic towards Leah and her genies, she can be civil towards them at times and even work with them such when she finds herself and/or Nazboo in danger usually when her schemes backfire, which usually results in them saving her. Before becoming a sorceress, she was a genie-in-training under Empress Caliana along with Samira, whom Zeta befriended when she was a new student, though later quit school due to her jealousy of Samira and decided to become a sorceress instead, though despite her current rivalry with Samira is shown to cherish their past friendship as she held onto a feather pen Samira gave her when they first met along with a picture of the two of them together when they were both still friends.\n*Kaz (voiced by [[Jet Jurgensmeyer]] in US, and [[Harrison Noble]] in UK) \u2013 A genie in training with blue eyes and magenta hair who becomes Zac's genie in the second season. In contrast to Zac's easy-going and adventurous personality, Kaz is more cautious and scared easily. Despite their contrasting personalities, Zac and Kaz work well together and can be brave when he has to be. His cautious nature also means he puts more thought into how he grants Zac's wishes. Like most genies in Zahramay Falls, he has his own magic carpet, though sometimes uses Zac's Super Zoom Flyer, a magic carpet wished up by Zac. Kaz has a pet Ziffilon named Zain, who summoned by one of Zac's wishes after he learned that Kaz always wanted a Ziffilon as a pet. Though he and Zac get along well, he occasionally becomes unenthusiastic when granting wishes for Zac he would prefer not too. He was initially afraid of Zac's dog Rocket due to being unfamiliar with dogs, though eventually overcame his fear after Zac and the girls reminded him of how other genies were initially scared of Zain before they got to know him.\n*Empress Caliana (voiced by [[Barbara Eden]]) \u2013 Princess Samira's famous, semi-retired mentor with purple eyes and blonde hair with pink tips. Caliana was the one who gave Samira her special necklace back when she was a little genie-in-training. Empress Caliana was a great explorer when she was a little girl and made many groundbreaking discoveries, such as finding the Caliana Caves. She is also old friends with Rohan, the normally shy crystalline golem that guards the caves. When Zeta and Samira were younger, Caliana taught genies-in-training at her school in Genie Hall, where Zeta was her top student. While praising Zeta's potion making skills, she tried to teach her to be more considerate of others and assigned Samira to sit next to Zeta when Samira was a new student which lead to Samira befriending Zeta, though Zeta eventually became jealous of Samira when she became the class's new top student, which eventually led Zeta to quit school and decide to become a Sorceress instead after her attempt to sabotage Samira backfired, though Caliana expressed hope to Samira that she would one day return. \n*Captain Zora (voiced by [[Kellie Pickler]] from the season two finale, [[Kate Higgins]] from season three and onward) \u2013 A pirate genie who is Shine's idol. She is absentminded at times and can be very clumsy and forgetful, especially when she is on an adventure. She owns a flying pirate ship that she sometimes accidentally docks in odd places. Shine loves pirate genies and Captain Zora is her favorite of them all, so she gets very nervous and sometimes cannot talk clearly when she is around Zora.\n*Layla (voiced by [[Danica McKellar]]) \u2013 An ice genie who is a good friend of Princess Samira. She possesses an ice gem necklace that gives her freezing powers and keeps her body cold. She originally lived in a genie bottle buried on a sandy beach in Zahramay Falls, but it was accidentally broken by Leah and her genies. She currently lives in an ice palace.\n*Shaya (voiced by [[Kin Santiago]] in Season 2 through 3 and [[Hudson West]]) \u2013 A lightning genie in training who rides around on a flying cloud-board and can generate magical lightning. Leah and her genies help him catch a run away magic lightning bolt he created while practicing his magic. Though he is reluctant to work with Leah and her genies at first, he eventually learns the value of teamwork from them.\n*Nila (voiced by [[Mila Brener]] in US, and [[Kimani Arthur]] in UK) \u2013 A mermaid who lives in the waters near Zahramay Falls. Leah and her genies befriend Nila after Leah wishes to find a Mermaid after learning they are real. She helps the girls obtain the Mermaid Gem to change the girls back to their non-mermaid selves after Leah accidentally uses up her wishes which leaves the girls trapped in Mermaid form. After Nila and the girls obtain the gem by befriending its lonely Guardian, she teaches them the spell to activate the gem's power which can both transform into Mermaids as well as undo the transformation allowing the girls to visit Nila and go on underwater adventures with her. \n*Imma  (voiced by [[Grace Kaufman]]) \u2013 The Waterfall Genie who oversees the source of the rainbow waterfalls of Zahramay Falls in Rainbow Zahramay. The girls befriend her after Samira sends them on their first adventure to Rainbow Zahramay to investigate the cause of a weird mist produced by the falls that disrupts magic in Zahramay Falls and help Imma resolve the problem. Imma can use water magic that allows her to manipulate water using her magic staff which she also uses to activate the locks that control the flow of rainbow water to the falls.\n* Wishy Washy Genie (voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]]) \u2013 A male genie whose powerful magic is to remove or fix a wish that cannot be used on other genies.

She is also the Gem Princess in charge of giving all the Genie Gems their magic.\n*Nadia (voiced by [[Brittany Snow]] in Season 3 and [[Lana McKissack]] in Season 4) \u2013 The Dream Genie who is the only genie capable of granting wishes involving dreams and specializes in dream magic which involve using magic dust. She is also in charge of crafting special dreams for everyone in Zahramay Falls. As a result, she knows about everyone in Zahramay Falls. However it is rare for her to make dreams actually come true. \n*Ezri (voiced by [[Gunnar Sizemore]]) \u2013 Nadia's assistant who like Nadia knows about everybody in Zahramay Falls as he recognizes Leah, Shimmer, Shine, and even Zeta on first meeting them.\n*Misha (voiced by [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]] in Season 3 and [[Kailey Snider]] in Season 4) \u2013 The Animal Genie who helps all the genies in Zarahmay Falls find their pets.\n*Princess Adara (voiced by [[Tania Gunadi]]) \u2013 The beautiful stardust princess of Zarahmay Skies.\n*Rubi (voiced by [[Luna Bella]]) \u2013 The Rainbow Genie of Zarahmay Skies.\n*Shaun (voiced by [[Ramone Hamilton]]) \u2013 Shaya's twin brother who's a cloud genie.\n\n===Animals===\nAll animals in the series are voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]].\n*Tala \u2013 Shimmer's pet [[gibbon monkey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nick-asia.com/shows/shimmer-and-shine/characters/tala/41pirj|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707235316/http://www.nick-asia.com/shows/shimmer-and-shine/characters/tala/41pirj|archivedate=July 7, 2017|title=Tala from Shimmer and Shine \u2013 Nick Asia|work=[[Nickelodeon (Southeast Asia)|Nickelodeon Southeast Asia]]|publisher=[[Viacom International|Viacom International, Inc.]]|accessdate=July 7, 2017}}</ref> She has green eyes and wears white pearls, like Shimmer does.

She has a talent for playing the keyboard.\n*Rocket \u2013 Zac's pet beagle who appears in several episodes of the first season and reappears in the third season. He is a rambunctious dog with a tendency to drool and chew on things which often causes trouble, though is simply an overly playful pouch who means no real harm. He has encountered Shimmer, Shine, Tala, and Nahal at various times. The only pet native to Leah and Zac's world, he eventually is wished to Zahramay Falls by Zac though is mistakenly seen as a monster by genies like Kaz and animals native to genie world like Parisa and Zain who are unfamiliar with dogs at first due to dogs not being native to their world, with the exception of Shimmer, Shine, Tala, Nahal, and Samira. After helping Zac stop Zeta from stealing Samira's staff, Samira permits Rocket to accompany Zac when he visits Zahramay Falls. \n*Nazboo \u2013 Zeta's talking pet dragon, who caters to her every need and acts as Zeta's underling. He has teal scales, purple eyes, white horns, a white tummy, and blue toes. He is somewhat clumsy and often accidentally causes Zeta's schemes to backfire. He can also get easily distracted by food or anything that piques his interest. He also enjoys getting an occasional tummy rub from Zeta. Though he acts as Zeta's underling most of the time, he is friendly towards Leah, Zac, and their genies as well as their pets to the point he often greets them by saying \"''Hi, Friends!''\" even in the middle of one of Zeta's schemes. Unlike Zeta, he is generally more considerate of others and prefers to play fair in competitions though usually assists Zeta in cheating. In the third season, he is revealed to be from Manetikar, The Land of Dragons and befriended Zeta when she came to Manetikar to find a dragon for a pet. Feeling sorry for Zeta after her attempt to make one of the larger flying dragons her pet failed, he agreed to become her pet and went home with her to her lair in Zahramay Falls, where he has lived ever since. He has a sister and two brothers who resemble him in appearance and personality.\n*Roya \u2013 Princess Samira's pet peacock, who resides in her palace. Roya is the polar opposite of Shimmer and Shine's pets, as she would much rather show off her feathers or practice walking gracefully than play or dance. Unlike Samira, Roya has a strong dislike for Zeta and Nazboo, to the point of literally chasing them out of Samira's Palace on one occasion. Once a year, she sheds a special feather with the ability to repair any magical object. \n*Parisa \u2013 Leah's pet Zahramay fox who possesses the ability to camouflage herself, making her practically invisible, whenever she wants. she also has a talent for painting. Parisa is introduced midway through the second season. Like Kaz and Zain, she was initially scared of Rocket, due to being unfamiliar with dogs, though not to the same degree that Kaz and Zain were.\n*Zain \u2013 Kaz's pet Ziffilon (a griffin-like creature). Kaz had always wanted a pet Ziffilon before getting Zain, so Zac uses one of his wishes to wish up a Ziffilon for Kaz. Zain is by far the largest of the pets, as he is big enough for Kaz to ride on his back, though despite his size Zain gets scared easily even more so than Kaz. Like most Ziffilons his favorite food is Zlam Berries and is originally from Ziffilon Island. Though he gets along with the other pets, he is frightened by Rocket at first due to being unfamiliar with dogs though after Zac reminds Kaz and Zain how other genies were scared of Zain at first, he and Kaz manage to overcome their initial fear of Rocket. \n*Zoomicorns \u2013 Winged Unicorns native to Zahramay Falls and Rainbow Zahramay introduced in the second season. They are friendly and helpful creatures who occasionally aid the girls and allow them to ride them. There is also a game called Zoomicorn Toss, where players ride flying Zahramay Cloud Boards while trying to throw rings around a Zoomicorn's horn as it flies around, without the use of magic as using magic is considered unfair. The only known named Zoomicorn, is Gleam who lives in Rainbow Zahramay that is a friend of the Glitter Genie Afina whom the girls meet and befriend during one of their adventures in Rainbow Zahramay in the third season. \n*Scallywag \u2013 The magical pet of the Pirate Genie Captain Zora, who helps Zora remember things that she forgets such as names and the meaning of words and phrases used by pirates. Scallywag flies around by spinning her tail in helicopter like fashion. Her magic goes out of control when scared, causing random magic effects. \n*Nazboo's Family \u2013 Nazboo's three siblings Razboo, Kazboo, and Frank who are introduced in the third season. They are all small flightless dragons that resemble Nazboo in appearance and share his friendly, playful nature as well as his love of food and tummy rubs. Nazboo and his siblings tend to get into trouble when they are together, much to Zeta's frustration and annoyance. Nazboo's sister Razboo has purple scales and wears a dark pink bow on her head. His brother Kazboo has dark green scales and a purple mohawk, while his brother Frank has blue scales and wears a light pink bowtie. Like their brother, Razboo, Kazboo, and Frank all have purple eyes, blue toes, and white bellies and horns. While Kazboo and Razboo are capable of speech like Nazboo, Frank's vocabulary is apparently limited to saying his own name, which doesn't rhyme with his other siblings' names.\n*Gleam \u2013 A blue glitter Zoomicorn native Rainbow Zarahmay.\n*Lulu \u2013 Misha's pet Panda.\n*Zahrora, Zoomdust, and Zadazzle \u2013 three Zarahcorns.\n*Dahliza \u2013 Princess Adara's Zarahcorn.\n*Fuzzle Whuzzles \u2013 Little creatures in Rainbow Zarahmay.\n*Azah \u2013 Rubi's Zarahcorn.\n\n==Production==\n''Shimmer and Shine'' is based on an unreleased pilot that took six months to develop in 2013, with a reported completion date of September 2013.

Each day, the genies grant Leah three wishes, but they often make mistakes. Each episode features Leah working together with the genies to resolve the problems they unintentionally cause, all while keeping Shimmer and Shine a secret from her next door neighbor and best friend Zac.\n\nIn the second season, the characters are transported to Zahramay Falls, a magical land where Shimmer and Shine live. Leah reveals her genies' existence to Zac, who is given a genie of his own, named Kaz. Shimmer and Shine continue to grant Leah wishes in Zahramay Falls and befriend the sovereign of the land, Princess Samira. The season includes Samira's pet peacock, Roya and Leah's pet fox, Parisa. Also, Zeta, a villainous sorceress, and finally, Zeta's dragon, Nazboo.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Shimmer and Shine episodes}}\n{{:List of Shimmer and Shine episodes}}\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Humans and genies===\n*Shimmer (voiced by [[Eva Bella]] in US, and [[Mia Wiltshire]] in UK) \u2013 An optimistic genie with blue eyes and pink hair. She is enthusiastic and encouraging. She loves cleaning, glitter, and collecting genie bottles. Her pet is a [[gibbon monkey]] named Tala.\n*Shine (voiced by [[Isabella Cramp]] in US, [[Elie Simons]] and [[Mia Hope]] in UK) \u2013 A courageous genie with purple eyes and blue hair. She is an animal lover and is often hungry. Her pet is a [[Bengal tiger]] cub named Nahal. Due to her love of animals, she is very knowledgeable about the behaviors of magical creatures native to Zahramay Falls. Unlike her sister, she hates cleaning. A running gag involves Shine saying \"It's like I always say...\" only to humorously reveal that she has just made up whatever she says next.\n*Leah (voiced by [[Alina Foley]] in US, and [[Claudia Burns]] in UK) \u2013 A blonde girl with green eyes who owns a genie bottle necklace, which includes Shimmer and Shine.<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Sweetest Thing |minutes=3 |series=Shimmer and Shine |quote=Boom Zahramay! Your best friends are on the way.}}</ref> Although Shimmer and Shine usually mess up her wishes, Leah is patient and forgiving with them. Originally, she was forced to keep her genies' existence a secret from her close friend Zac, but revealed her secret to him after being transported to Zahramay Falls. In the second season, Princess Samira grants Leah and Zac's wish to visit Zahramay Falls whenever they want. While visiting her genies in Zahramay Falls, Leah magically dons a genie disguise in order to blend in, as humans are normally not allowed in Zahramay Falls.\n*Zac (voiced by [[Blake Bertrand]] in the first two seasons, [[Justin Felbinger]], and later [[Ethan Jones]] in season three and onward in US, and [[Innis Robertson-Pinnel]] in UK) \u2013 Leah's neighbor with red hair and blue eyes, and best human friend. In the first season, he is oblivious to the fact that Leah has genies. Whenever something strange or unusual happens, he responds to it in a carefree manner. He also has a habit of telling humorous experiences he has had to Leah. In the second season, he learns that Leah has genies and gets a genie of his own named Kaz.\n*Princess Samira (voiced by [[Nikki SooHoo]] in US, and [[Cariad Lloyd]] in UK) \u2013 The ruler of Zahramay Falls with violet eyes and ice blue hair with darker blue tips, who is in charge of checking up on all the genies in training. She can grant wishes along with the younger genies. She occasionally rewards genies with magic Genie Gems that can have a variety of magical effects. She acts as Shimmer and Shine's mentor and teacher. Despite Zeta being her self-proclaimed rival, Samira likes Zeta and is willing to give her a second chance at becoming a genie-in-training, which in season three is revealed to be due to her past friendship with Zeta when they were both students under Empress Caliana and hopes that Zeta and her can one day become friends again.\n*Zeta the Sorceress (voiced by [[Lacey Chabert]] in US & UK) \u2013 A resident of Zahramay Falls with green eyes and purple hair, who is Princess Samira's rival and wishes to replace her as the most powerful person in Zahramay Falls. Zeta is a sorceress instead of a genie, as she has no desire to grant the wishes of others, relying on magic potions and magical items. Her plans are almost always thwarted by Shimmer, Shine, and Leah. However, her own arrogance and ignorance can cause her to foil her own schemes as well. Despite the trouble she causes, the girls and Zac don't hold it against her and generally try to be friendly towards her when not foiling her schemes. Though she tends to be antagonistic towards Leah and her genies, she can be civil towards them at times and even work with them such when she finds herself and/or Nazboo in danger usually when her schemes backfire, which usually results in them saving her. Before becoming a sorceress, she was a genie-in-training under Empress Caliana along with Samira, whom Zeta befriended when she was a new student, though later quit school due to her jealousy of Samira and decided to become a sorceress instead, though despite her current rivalry with Samira is shown to cherish their past friendship as she held onto a feather pen Samira gave her when they first met along with a picture of the two of them together when they were both still friends.\n*Kaz (voiced by [[Jet Jurgensmeyer]] in US, and [[Harrison Noble]] in UK) \u2013 A genie in training with blue eyes and magenta hair who becomes Zac's genie in the second season. In contrast to Zac's easy-going and adventurous personality, Kaz is more cautious and scared easily. Despite their contrasting personalities, Zac and Kaz work well together and can be brave when he has to be. His cautious nature also means he puts more thought into how he grants Zac's wishes. Like most genies in Zahramay Falls, he has his own magic carpet, though sometimes uses Zac's Super Zoom Flyer, a magic carpet wished up by Zac. Kaz has a pet Ziffilon named Zain, who summoned by one of Zac's wishes after he learned that Kaz always wanted a Ziffilon as a pet. Though he and Zac get along well, he occasionally becomes unenthusiastic when granting wishes for Zac he would prefer not too. He was initially afraid of Zac's dog Rocket due to being unfamiliar with dogs, though eventually overcame his fear after Zac and the girls reminded him of how other genies were initially scared of Zain before they got to know him.\n*Empress Caliana (voiced by [[Barbara Eden]]) \u2013 Princess Samira's famous, semi-retired mentor with purple eyes and blonde hair with pink tips. Caliana was the one who gave Samira her special necklace back when she was a little genie-in-training. Empress Caliana was a great explorer when she was a little girl and made many groundbreaking discoveries, such as finding the Caliana Caves. She is also old friends with Rohan, the normally shy crystalline golem that guards the caves. When Zeta and Samira were younger, Caliana taught genies-in-training at her school in Genie Hall, where Zeta was her top student. While praising Zeta's potion making skills, she tried to teach her to be more considerate of others and assigned Samira to sit next to Zeta when Samira was a new student which lead to Samira befriending Zeta, though Zeta eventually became jealous of Samira when she became the class's new top student, which eventually led Zeta to quit school and decide to become a Sorceress instead after her attempt to sabotage Samira backfired, though Caliana expressed hope to Samira that she would one day return. \n*Captain Zora (voiced by [[Kellie Pickler]] from the season two finale, [[Kate Higgins]] from season three and onward) \u2013 A pirate genie who is Shine's idol. She is absentminded at times and can be very clumsy and forgetful, especially when she is on an adventure. She owns a flying pirate ship that she sometimes accidentally docks in odd places. Shine loves pirate genies and Captain Zora is her favorite of them all, so she gets very nervous and sometimes cannot talk clearly when she is around Zora.\n*Layla (voiced by [[Danica McKellar]]) \u2013 An ice genie who is a good friend of Princess Samira. She possesses an ice gem necklace that gives her freezing powers and keeps her body cold. She originally lived in a genie bottle buried on a sandy beach in Zahramay Falls, but it was accidentally broken by Leah and her genies. She currently lives in an ice palace.\n*Shaya (voiced by [[Kin Santiago]] in Season 2 through 3 and [[Hudson West]]) \u2013 A lightning genie in training who rides around on a flying cloud-board and can generate magical lightning. Leah and her genies help him catch a run away magic lightning bolt he created while practicing his magic. Though he is reluctant to work with Leah and her genies at first, he eventually learns the value of teamwork from them.\n*Nila (voiced by [[Mila Brener]] in US, and [[Kimani Arthur]] in UK) \u2013 A mermaid who lives in the waters near Zahramay Falls. Leah and her genies befriend Nila after Leah wishes to find a Mermaid after learning they are real. She helps the girls obtain the Mermaid Gem to change the girls back to their non-mermaid selves after Leah accidentally uses up her wishes which leaves the girls trapped in Mermaid form. After Nila and the girls obtain the gem by befriending its lonely Guardian, she teaches them the spell to activate the gem's power which can both transform into Mermaids as well as undo the transformation allowing the girls to visit Nila and go on underwater adventures with her. \n*Imma  (voiced by [[Grace Kaufman]]) \u2013 The Waterfall Genie who oversees the source of the rainbow waterfalls of Zahramay Falls in Rainbow Zahramay. The girls befriend her after Samira sends them on their first adventure to Rainbow Zahramay to investigate the cause of a weird mist produced by the falls that disrupts magic in Zahramay Falls and help Imma resolve the problem. Imma can use water magic that allows her to manipulate water using her magic staff which she also uses to activate the locks that control the flow of rainbow water to the falls.\n* Wishy Washy Genie (voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]]) \u2013 A male genie whose powerful magic is to remove or fix a wish that cannot be used on other genies. He can be very wishy washy, just like his name. But while on their adventure to find his home, the children help him make decisions.\n*Ayla (voiced by [[Liliana Mumy]]) \u2013 A hair-changing genie who has the power to change hairstyles.\n*Minu (voiced by [[Kitana Turnbull]]) \u2013 A flitter genie.\n*Afina (voiced by [[Julie Nathanson]]) \u2013 The Glitter Genie who lives in a glittery palace on a cloud in Rainbow Zarahmay.\n*Princess Ula (voiced by [[Tatyana Ali]]) \u2013 The ruler of Rainbow Zarahmay.

However it is rare for her to make dreams actually come true. \n*Ezri (voiced by [[Gunnar Sizemore]]) \u2013 Nadia's assistant who like Nadia knows about everybody in Zahramay Falls as he recognizes Leah, Shimmer, Shine, and even Zeta on first meeting them.\n*Misha (voiced by [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]] in Season 3 and [[Kailey Snider]] in Season 4) \u2013 The Animal Genie who helps all the genies in Zarahmay Falls find their pets.\n*Princess Adara (voiced by [[Tania Gunadi]]) \u2013 The beautiful stardust princess of Zarahmay Skies.\n*Rubi (voiced by [[Luna Bella]]) \u2013 The Rainbow Genie of Zarahmay Skies.\n*Shaun (voiced by [[Ramone Hamilton]]) \u2013 Shaya's twin brother who's a cloud genie.\n\n===Animals===\nAll animals in the series are voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]].\n*Tala \u2013 Shimmer's pet [[gibbon monkey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nick-asia.com/shows/shimmer-and-shine/characters/tala/41pirj|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707235316/http://www.nick-asia.com/shows/shimmer-and-shine/characters/tala/41pirj|archivedate=July 7, 2017|title=Tala from Shimmer and Shine \u2013 Nick Asia|work=[[Nickelodeon (Southeast Asia)|Nickelodeon Southeast Asia]]|publisher=[[Viacom International|Viacom International, Inc.]]|accessdate=July 7, 2017}}</ref> She has green eyes and wears white pearls, like Shimmer does.

The only pet native to Leah and Zac's world, he eventually is wished to Zahramay Falls by Zac though is mistakenly seen as a monster by genies like Kaz and animals native to genie world like Parisa and Zain who are unfamiliar with dogs at first due to dogs not being native to their world, with the exception of Shimmer, Shine, Tala, Nahal, and Samira.

He has a sister and two brothers who resemble him in appearance and personality.\n*Roya \u2013 Princess Samira's pet peacock, who resides in her palace.

Like Kaz and Zain, she was initially scared of Rocket, due to being unfamiliar with dogs, though not to the same degree that Kaz and Zain were.\n*Zain \u2013 Kaz's pet Ziffilon (a griffin-like creature). Kaz had always wanted a pet Ziffilon before getting Zain, so Zac uses one of his wishes to wish up a Ziffilon for Kaz. Zain is by far the largest of the pets, as he is big enough for Kaz to ride on his back, though despite his size Zain gets scared easily even more so than Kaz. Like most Ziffilons his favorite food is Zlam Berries and is originally from Ziffilon Island. Though he gets along with the other pets, he is frightened by Rocket at first due to being unfamiliar with dogs though after Zac reminds Kaz and Zain how other genies were scared of Zain at first, he and Kaz manage to overcome their initial fear of Rocket. \n*Zoomicorns \u2013 Winged Unicorns native to Zahramay Falls and Rainbow Zahramay introduced in the second season. They are friendly and helpful creatures who occasionally aid the girls and allow them to ride them. There is also a game called Zoomicorn Toss, where players ride flying Zahramay Cloud Boards while trying to throw rings around a Zoomicorn's horn as it flies around, without the use of magic as using magic is considered unfair. The only known named Zoomicorn, is Gleam who lives in Rainbow Zahramay that is a friend of the Glitter Genie Afina whom the girls meet and befriend during one of their adventures in Rainbow Zahramay in the third season. \n*Scallywag \u2013 The magical pet of the Pirate Genie Captain Zora, who helps Zora remember things that she forgets such as names and the meaning of words and phrases used by pirates. Scallywag flies around by spinning her tail in helicopter like fashion. Her magic goes out of control when scared, causing random magic effects. \n*Nazboo's Family \u2013 Nazboo's three siblings Razboo, Kazboo, and Frank who are introduced in the third season. They are all small flightless dragons that resemble Nazboo in appearance and share his friendly, playful nature as well as his love of food and tummy rubs. Nazboo and his siblings tend to get into trouble when they are together, much to Zeta's frustration and annoyance. Nazboo's sister Razboo has purple scales and wears a dark pink bow on her head. His brother Kazboo has dark green scales and a purple mohawk, while his brother Frank has blue scales and wears a light pink bowtie. Like their brother, Razboo, Kazboo, and Frank all have purple eyes, blue toes, and white bellies and horns. While Kazboo and Razboo are capable of speech like Nazboo, Frank's vocabulary is apparently limited to saying his own name, which doesn't rhyme with his other siblings' names.\n*Gleam \u2013 A blue glitter Zoomicorn native Rainbow Zarahmay.\n*Lulu \u2013 Misha's pet Panda.\n*Zahrora, Zoomdust, and Zadazzle \u2013 three Zarahcorns.\n*Dahliza \u2013 Princess Adara's Zarahcorn.\n*Fuzzle Whuzzles \u2013 Little creatures in Rainbow Zarahmay.\n*Azah \u2013 Rubi's Zarahcorn.\n\n==Production==\n''Shimmer and Shine'' is based on an unreleased pilot that took six months to develop in 2013, with a reported completion date of September 2013.

Consumption had to be organized through a [[cooperative federation|union of cooperatives]] - local self-governing [[consumer cooperatives|consumer societies]], united in a common federation. Economic life should be organized by the joint arrangements of these two associations, for which it was necessary to create special economic councils, elected from production and consumer organizations. Political and military power should have been concentrated in the hands of political councils elected by the working people on a territorial basis.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe Ukrainian Left Socialist Revolutionaries (led by [[Yakov Brown]]) believed that along with economic and political councils, councils on ethnic issues should elected by representatives of various ethnic communities of workers - [[Jews]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Russians]], [[Greeks]], etc., which, in their opinion, would be especially relevant for multinational Ukraine. Each person received the right to freely \"enroll\" in any community of their choice - ethnicity was considered by the Left Socialist Revolutionaries to be a matter of free self-determination of a person, the result of his personal choice, and not a question of blood.

By December 2014, only the\nTucson, Del Rio, and Laredo sectors continued to participate in Streamline.

This is in contrast to the historical policy of [[catch and release (U.S. immigration policy)|catch and release]] and even to the policy of deporting people through [[expedited removal]] or after formal removal proceedings. Under Operation Streamline, immigration violations are processed under the ''criminal'' justice system.<ref name=hrw/><ref name=nytimes>{{cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/12/us/split-second-justice-as-us-cracks-down-on-border-crossers.html?_r=1|title = Detainees Sentenced in Seconds in \u2018Streamline\u2019 Justice on Border|date = February 11, 2014|accessdate = August 17, 2015|newspaper = [[New York Times]]|last = Santons|first = Fernanda}}</ref>\n\nThe penalties that Operation Streamline carries for immigrants are as follows:<ref name=berkeley/>\n\n* First-time offenders are prosecuted for misdemeanor illegal entry (8 U.S.C. Section 1325) that carries a six-month maximum sentence.\n* Any migrant who has been deported in the past and attempts to re-enter without authorization can be charged with felony re-entry that carries a two-year sentence but can involve up to a 20-year maximum if the migrant has a criminal record.\n\nAbout 99% of people prosecuted under Operation Streamline plead guilty.<ref name=berkeley/> According to the ''[[Washington Post]]'', this is because those who plead guilty are likely to get substantially shorter prison terms than the theoretical maximum, whereas those who do not plead guilty are likely to get close to the maximum sentence.<ref name=wapo>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/under-operation-streamline-fast-track-proceedings-for-illegal-immigrants/2014/02/10/87529d24-919d-11e3-97d3-f7da321f6f33_story.html|title = Under Operation Streamline, fast-track proceedings for illegal immigrants|last = Partlow|first = Joshua|date = February 10, 2014|accessdate = August 17, 2015|newspaper = [[Washington Post]]}}</ref>\n\nThe annual cost of Operation Streamline in [[Arizona]] alone was estimated as $120 million for court proceedings and $50 million for detention and incarceration.<ref name=nmd>{{cite web|url=http://forms.nomoredeaths.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/nmd_fact_sheet_operation_streamline.pdf|title = Fact Sheet: Operation Streamline|date = March 1, 2012|accessdate = August 17, 2015|publisher = No More Deaths}}</ref>\n\n=== Bundling and rapid processing of cases ===\nAnother distinguishing feature of Operation Streamline is that cases are not heard individually, but rather in large groups, with many people caught crossing the border together generally being processed in one case.<ref name=hrw/><ref name=nytimes/> According to a ''[[New York Times]]'' report, a single court case in [[Tucson, Arizona]] can have up to 70 defendants, the upper limit being set by the physical capacity of the court. The time taken to decide the cases varies between 30 minutes (or 25 seconds per defendant) and 2 hours 35 minutes (or a little over 2 minutes per defendant).<ref name=nytimes/>\n\n=== Relationship with expedited removal ===\n[[Expedited removal]] is a removal procedure where a person who has recently entered the United States without authorization and does not qualify for some particular exemptions may be removed without going through formal removal proceedings. A person who is sentenced through Operation Streamline may be subject to expedited removal after completing his or her prison term.<ref name=oser>{{cite web|url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1263&context=blrlj|title = Prosecuting the Persecuted: How Operation Streamline and Expedited Removal Violate Article 31 of the Convention on the Status of Refugees and 1967 Protocol|last = Puhl|first = Emily|publisher = Berkeley La Raza Law Journal}}</ref>\n\nExpedited removal may apply not just to people caught by [[United States Border Patrol]] in the act of border-crossing but also people who have recently crossed a border and are living in the United States. Also, although expedited removal may be applied ''after'' criminal prosecution through Operation Streamline, it is itself an administrative procedure and does not involve the criminal justice system.\n\nIn terms of historical timeline, the rollout of Operation Streamline started at around the time that the rollout of expedited removal was being completed. Expedited removal was expanded to all border sectors by September 2005 and the entire border zone by March 2006, whereas Operation Streamline launched in December 2005.\n\n=== Relationship with reinstatement of removal ===\n[[Reinstatement of removal]] is a removal procedure where a person who had a previous order of removal and subsequently departed the United States, and then re-entered without authorization, may be removed by \"reinstating\" the previous order. Like expedited removal, it is an administrative procedure that does not involve the criminal justice system. Like expedited removal, it may be applied to a person making a repeat unauthorized entry after the person has gone through the Operation Streamline court process.\n\n=== Relationship with credible fear ===\nIn principle, a person being subject to criminal prosecution via Operation Streamline should have the opportunity to request asylum and get scheduled for a [[credible fear]] interview. However, due to the rapid processing of these cases, many people do not get this opportunity, and may have to serve their prison term despite being eligible for asylum. After the prison term is completed and they are being processed for expedited removal, they are asked if they would like to request asylum and, if so, are scheduled for the credible fear interview.<ref name=oser/>\n\n== History ==\n=== Initial launch in Del Rio (December 2005) ===\nAn initial version of Operation Streamline was proposed by the [[United States Border Patrol]] for [[Del Rio, Texas]] in response to a significant increase in the number of apprehended non-Mexican migrants, from 10,000 in 2004 to 15,000 in 2005.<ref name=grassroots>{{cite web|url=http://grassrootsleadership.org/sites/default/files/uploads/GRL_Sept2012_Report-final.pdf|title = Operation Streamline: Costs and Consequences|publisher = Grassroots Leadership|date = September 1, 2012|accessdate = August 19, 2015}}</ref> The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Texas requested a change to the proposal: in order to avoid running afoul of equal protection, the courts would need to criminally prosecute all migrants, not just those from Mexico.<ref name=grassroots/> Note that many other related programs, such as the [[expedited removal]] procedure, do treat people differently based on nationality: those from Mexico or Canada without a criminal record are not subject to expedited removal, whereas people from other countries may be subject to expedited removal despite the absence of a criminal record. However, the provisions of these programs do not run afoul of equal protection because they are not administered through the criminal justice system.\n\nAfter approval from then [[Department of Homeland Security]] Secretary [[Michael Chertoff]], Operation Streamline became active starting December 2005:  all unauthorized border-crossers in the [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]] area of the Del Rio sector would be prosecuted criminally for unlawful entry and re-entry.<ref name=grassroots/>\n\n=== Rollout to other border sectors ===\nOperation Streamline was gradually rolled out in other parts of the United States border:<ref name=mpi/><ref name=grassroots/>\n\n* [[Yuma, Arizona]] in December 2006\n* [[Laredo, Texas]] in November 2007\n* [[Tucson, Arizona]] in January 2008\n* [[McAllen, Texas]] and [[Brownsville, Texas]] (the [[Rio Grande Valley]] sectors) in June 2008\n\nBy 2010, every US-Mexico border sector not in California had implemented Operation Streamline.<ref name=grassroots/>\n\n=== Legal challenge ===\nIn December, 2009, it was decided in United States v. Roblero-Solis that en masse judicial proceedings like those in Operation Streamline violated Rule 11 in the [[Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure]]. Rule 11 states that the court must determine that a guilty plea is voluntarily made by addressing the defendant personally in court.

By December 2014, only the\nTucson, Del Rio, and Laredo sectors continued to participate in Streamline.

This is in contrast to the historical policy of [[catch and release (U.S. immigration policy)|catch and release]] and even to the policy of deporting people through [[expedited removal]] or after formal removal proceedings.

Section 1325) that carries a six-month maximum sentence.\n* Any migrant who has been deported in the past and attempts to re-enter without authorization can be charged with felony re-entry that carries a two-year sentence but can involve up to a 20-year maximum if the migrant has a criminal record.\n\nAbout 99% of people prosecuted under Operation Streamline plead guilty.<ref name=berkeley/> According to the ''[[Washington Post]]'', this is because those who plead guilty are likely to get substantially shorter prison terms than the theoretical maximum, whereas those who do not plead guilty are likely to get close to the maximum sentence.<ref name=wapo>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/under-operation-streamline-fast-track-proceedings-for-illegal-immigrants/2014/02/10/87529d24-919d-11e3-97d3-f7da321f6f33_story.html|title = Under Operation Streamline, fast-track proceedings for illegal immigrants|last = Partlow|first = Joshua|date = February 10, 2014|accessdate = August 17, 2015|newspaper = [[Washington Post]]}}</ref>\n\nThe annual cost of Operation Streamline in [[Arizona]] alone was estimated as $120 million for court proceedings and $50 million for detention and incarceration.<ref name=nmd>{{cite web|url=http://forms.nomoredeaths.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/nmd_fact_sheet_operation_streamline.pdf|title = Fact Sheet: Operation Streamline|date = March 1, 2012|accessdate = August 17, 2015|publisher = No More Deaths}}</ref>\n\n=== Bundling and rapid processing of cases ===\nAnother distinguishing feature of Operation Streamline is that cases are not heard individually, but rather in large groups, with many people caught crossing the border together generally being processed in one case.<ref name=hrw/><ref name=nytimes/> According to a ''[[New York Times]]'' report, a single court case in [[Tucson, Arizona]] can have up to 70 defendants, the upper limit being set by the physical capacity of the court. The time taken to decide the cases varies between 30 minutes (or 25 seconds per defendant) and 2 hours 35 minutes (or a little over 2 minutes per defendant).<ref name=nytimes/>\n\n=== Relationship with expedited removal ===\n[[Expedited removal]] is a removal procedure where a person who has recently entered the United States without authorization and does not qualify for some particular exemptions may be removed without going through formal removal proceedings. A person who is sentenced through Operation Streamline may be subject to expedited removal after completing his or her prison term.<ref name=oser>{{cite web|url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1263&context=blrlj|title = Prosecuting the Persecuted: How Operation Streamline and Expedited Removal Violate Article 31 of the Convention on the Status of Refugees and 1967 Protocol|last = Puhl|first = Emily|publisher = Berkeley La Raza Law Journal}}</ref>\n\nExpedited removal may apply not just to people caught by [[United States Border Patrol]] in the act of border-crossing but also people who have recently crossed a border and are living in the United States. Also, although expedited removal may be applied ''after'' criminal prosecution through Operation Streamline, it is itself an administrative procedure and does not involve the criminal justice system.\n\nIn terms of historical timeline, the rollout of Operation Streamline started at around the time that the rollout of expedited removal was being completed. Expedited removal was expanded to all border sectors by September 2005 and the entire border zone by March 2006, whereas Operation Streamline launched in December 2005.\n\n=== Relationship with reinstatement of removal ===\n[[Reinstatement of removal]] is a removal procedure where a person who had a previous order of removal and subsequently departed the United States, and then re-entered without authorization, may be removed by \"reinstating\" the previous order. Like expedited removal, it is an administrative procedure that does not involve the criminal justice system. Like expedited removal, it may be applied to a person making a repeat unauthorized entry after the person has gone through the Operation Streamline court process.\n\n=== Relationship with credible fear ===\nIn principle, a person being subject to criminal prosecution via Operation Streamline should have the opportunity to request asylum and get scheduled for a [[credible fear]] interview. However, due to the rapid processing of these cases, many people do not get this opportunity, and may have to serve their prison term despite being eligible for asylum. After the prison term is completed and they are being processed for expedited removal, they are asked if they would like to request asylum and, if so, are scheduled for the credible fear interview.<ref name=oser/>\n\n== History ==\n=== Initial launch in Del Rio (December 2005) ===\nAn initial version of Operation Streamline was proposed by the [[United States Border Patrol]] for [[Del Rio, Texas]] in response to a significant increase in the number of apprehended non-Mexican migrants, from 10,000 in 2004 to 15,000 in 2005.<ref name=grassroots>{{cite web|url=http://grassrootsleadership.org/sites/default/files/uploads/GRL_Sept2012_Report-final.pdf|title = Operation Streamline: Costs and Consequences|publisher = Grassroots Leadership|date = September 1, 2012|accessdate = August 19, 2015}}</ref> The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Texas requested a change to the proposal: in order to avoid running afoul of equal protection, the courts would need to criminally prosecute all migrants, not just those from Mexico.<ref name=grassroots/> Note that many other related programs, such as the [[expedited removal]] procedure, do treat people differently based on nationality: those from Mexico or Canada without a criminal record are not subject to expedited removal, whereas people from other countries may be subject to expedited removal despite the absence of a criminal record. However, the provisions of these programs do not run afoul of equal protection because they are not administered through the criminal justice system.\n\nAfter approval from then [[Department of Homeland Security]] Secretary [[Michael Chertoff]], Operation Streamline became active starting December 2005:  all unauthorized border-crossers in the [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]] area of the Del Rio sector would be prosecuted criminally for unlawful entry and re-entry.<ref name=grassroots/>\n\n=== Rollout to other border sectors ===\nOperation Streamline was gradually rolled out in other parts of the United States border:<ref name=mpi/><ref name=grassroots/>\n\n* [[Yuma, Arizona]] in December 2006\n* [[Laredo, Texas]] in November 2007\n* [[Tucson, Arizona]] in January 2008\n* [[McAllen, Texas]] and [[Brownsville, Texas]] (the [[Rio Grande Valley]] sectors) in June 2008\n\nBy 2010, every US-Mexico border sector not in California had implemented Operation Streamline.<ref name=grassroots/>\n\n=== Legal challenge ===\nIn December, 2009, it was decided in United States v. Roblero-Solis that en masse judicial proceedings like those in Operation Streamline violated Rule 11 in the [[Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure]]. Rule 11 states that the court must determine that a guilty plea is voluntarily made by addressing the defendant personally in court. The Roblero-Solis case determined that \u201cpersonally\u201d means that the judge must address the defendant in a person-to-person manner.<ref name=Nazarian>{{cite journal|last1=Nazarian|first1=E.|title=Crossing Over:  Assessing Operation Streamline and the Rights of Immigrant Criminal Defendants at the Border|journal=Loyola of Los Angeles Law Review|date=2011|volume=44|pages=1399\u20131430|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/lla44&collection=journals&page=1399|archiveurl=http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2761&context=llr |archivedate=2011 }}</ref>\n\n=== Protests ===\nStarting February 2013, Operation Streamline has been protested by activists in [[Arizona]] and [[Texas]], the two main states where it is operational.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grassrootsleadership.org/OperationStreamline|title = Operation Streamline|publisher = Grassroots Leadership|accessdate = August 23, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/20/operation-streamline-protest-tucson-arizona-texas_n_2724637.html|title = Operation Streamline, Immigration Enforcement Program, Protested In Arizona And Texas|last = Planas|first = Roque|date = February 22, 2013|accessdate = August 23, 2015|work = [[Huffington Post]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://nacla.org/blog/2015/07/26/civil-disobedience-against-operation-streamline|title = Civil Disobedience against Operation Streamline.

Also, it is not applied to people from Mexico or Canada unless they have a criminal history.\n* [[Reinstatement of removal]] is a fast-track removal process where somebody who re-entered after having left the United States after a past order of removal is removed again by \"reinstating\" the previous order. This too is a purely administrative procedure and does not involve criminal charges.\n* [[Credible fear]]: Anybody who expresses a fear of persecution or torture, or requests asylum, at any stage of the removal process, may appear for a credible fear interview where the interviewing officer attempts to assess whether the person's fear is credible. If so, the person cannot be subject to expedited removal and must go through formal removal proceedings.\n* [[Secure Border Initiative]]\n* [[Catch and release (U.S. immigration policy)]], a protocol historically followed by immigration enforcement agencies in the United States  where people caught for being in unlawful immigration status are released while they wait for a hearing with an immigration judge. \n*[[Trump administration family separation policy]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Immigration to the United States]]\n", "name_user": "2601:283:8203:9b80:e014:2483:9489:2d29", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Streamline"}
