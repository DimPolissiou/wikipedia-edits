In the video, Hanna focused on the image accompanying the article rather than the information about her murder, leading to backlash from her community. Soon after, on February 13, 2020, Hanna posted a video in which she read an apology she sent to Bianca's mother. Hanna explained as she skimmed through the article, she missed the body of text next to Bianca's photo and said she would not have included it if she had understood its context. Hanna also read messages from a conversation she had with Bianca's mother where said she appreciated Hanna's apology and that she reached out to her personally. Her video included a link to the Bianca Michelle Devins Memorial Scholarship Fund, and Hanna stated that the ad revenue from this video contributed to that fund.<ref>{{Citation|title=For Bianca.|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OX-g_MZdW9c|language=en|access-date=2020-02-14}}</ref>\n\n== Filmography ==\n===Film, television and web series===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Film / Show / Web\n!Role\n!Notes\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| 2014\n| ''[[Access Hollywood]]''\n| Herself\n| 1 episode\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| 2014\u201315\n| ''[[Thomas Sanders (entertainer)|Sanders Shorts]]''\n| Friend, girlfriend\n| 2 episodes\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"6\" |2015\n| ''Anxt''\n| Herself\n| Full series\n|-\n| ''Teens Wanna Know''\n| Herself\n| 1 episode\n|-\n| ''Dance Showdown''\n| Herself\n| Dancer; won the competition\n|-\n| ''Occupy Alice''\n| Melissa Krass\n| Short film\n|-\n| ''Oscar's Hotel for Fantastical Creatures''\n| Snow Pea\n| 1 episode\n|-\n| ''Janoskians: Untold and Untrue''\n| Herself\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"4\" | 2016\n| ''[[Laid in America]]''\n| Lindsey\n|\n|-\n| ''Dance Showdown''\n| Herself\n| Judge (6 episodes)\n|-\n| AwesomenessTV's ''Betch!''\n| Laura\n| 1 episode\n|-\n|[[Verizon Communications|Verizon]] advertisement\n| Herself\n|Commercial\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"5\" | 2017\n| ''[[Escape the Night]]''\n| The Vaudevillian\n| 7 episodes (season 2)\n|-\n| ''Fantasies''\n| Herself\n| Guest star (1 episode)\n|-\n| ''[[MTV Video Music Awards]]''\n| Herself\n| Backstage host\n|-\n| Smosh's ''You Posted That?''\n| Herself\n| Contestant (1 episode)\n|-\n| Romeo Lacoste's ''Tattoo Roulette''\n| Herself\n| Special assistant to the host (1 episode)\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| 2017\u201318\n| [[MTV|MTV's]] ''[[Total Request Live]]''\n| Herself\n| Rotating co-host\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"4\" | 2018\n| ''[[Escape the Night]]''\n| The Vaudevillian\n| Season 3 season finale (flashback clip)\n|-\n| [[Shane Dawson|Shane Dawson's]] ''The Truth About TanaCon''\n| Herself\n| Miniseries.

On December 26, 2019 he uploaded video proof of the phone call.  Also in this video, James said that Hanna called him back 10 minutes after the prank call and revealed that she had made the prank call.

Hanna promptly deleted the 2011 tweet and tweeted an apology, saying at the age of 20 she thought it was funny and that she's \"sorry to anyone who was hurt by this, i think it's gross, too\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/GabbieHanna/status/1211458432844222464?s=19|title=Gabbie Hanna adresses pedophilia joke|last=Gabbie Hanna|first=@gabbiehanna|date=December 29, 2019|website=[[Twitter]]|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=December 30, 2019}}</ref> Hanna later added on her podcast that multiple old tweets that people were digging up against her were [[Bo Burnham]] quotes and at the time, certain jokes were considered comical that would not be in the present day.<ref>{{Cite news|url= https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=T4_PIAZe4XU|title=Our Thoughts on NikkieTutorials Coming Out|work=Box of Thoughts Podcast|accessdate=January 28, 2020}}</ref>\n\n====2020: Bianca Devins====\nOn January 23, 2020, Hanna uploaded a video titled \"Transforming into a TikTok E-Girl\" where she included an article from Vox: \"E-girl definition: What is an e-girl? - Vox\". In the video, Hanna focused on the image accompanying the article rather than the information about her murder, leading to backlash from her community. Soon after, on February 13, 2020, Hanna posted a video in which she read an apology she sent to Bianca's mother. Hanna explained as she skimmed through the article, she missed the body of text next to Bianca's photo and said she would not have included it if she had understood its context. Hanna also read messages from a conversation she had with Bianca's mother where said she appreciated Hanna's apology and that she reached out to her personally. Her video included a link to the Bianca Michelle Devins Memorial Scholarship Fund, and Hanna stated that the ad revenue from this video contributed to that fund.<ref>{{Citation|title=For Bianca.|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OX-g_MZdW9c|language=en|access-date=2020-02-14}}</ref>\n\n== Filmography ==\n===Film, television and web series===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Film / Show / Web\n!Role\n!Notes\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| 2014\n| ''[[Access Hollywood]]''\n| Herself\n| 1 episode\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| 2014\u201315\n| ''[[Thomas Sanders (entertainer)|Sanders Shorts]]''\n| Friend, girlfriend\n| 2 episodes\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"6\" |2015\n| ''Anxt''\n| Herself\n| Full series\n|-\n| ''Teens Wanna Know''\n| Herself\n| 1 episode\n|-\n| ''Dance Showdown''\n| Herself\n| Dancer; won the competition\n|-\n| ''Occupy Alice''\n| Melissa Krass\n| Short film\n|-\n| ''Oscar's Hotel for Fantastical Creatures''\n| Snow Pea\n| 1 episode\n|-\n| ''Janoskians: Untold and Untrue''\n| Herself\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"4\" | 2016\n| ''[[Laid in America]]''\n| Lindsey\n|\n|-\n| ''Dance Showdown''\n| Herself\n| Judge (6 episodes)\n|-\n| AwesomenessTV's ''Betch!''\n| Laura\n| 1 episode\n|-\n|[[Verizon Communications|Verizon]] advertisement\n| Herself\n|Commercial\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"5\" | 2017\n| ''[[Escape the Night]]''\n| The Vaudevillian\n| 7 episodes (season 2)\n|-\n| ''Fantasies''\n| Herself\n| Guest star (1 episode)\n|-\n| ''[[MTV Video Music Awards]]''\n| Herself\n| Backstage host\n|-\n| Smosh's ''You Posted That?''\n| Herself\n| Contestant (1 episode)\n|-\n| Romeo Lacoste's ''Tattoo Roulette''\n| Herself\n| Special assistant to the host (1 episode)\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| 2017\u201318\n| [[MTV|MTV's]] ''[[Total Request Live]]''\n| Herself\n| Rotating co-host\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"4\" | 2018\n| ''[[Escape the Night]]''\n| The Vaudevillian\n| Season 3 season finale (flashback clip)\n|-\n| [[Shane Dawson|Shane Dawson's]] ''The Truth About TanaCon''\n| Herself\n| Miniseries.
