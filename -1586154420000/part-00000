More specifically it is used to describe the expeditionary campaigns of the [[British Army]] in the Kingdom of Kandy in 1803 and 1815.\n\n==Hello==\nHello world this is kalindu delpachitre u can follow me in Instagram name is kalindu_del\n\n==First war (1803\u20131805)==\n[[Image:Central province1.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Terrain near Kandy; much of the Kingdom was mountainous, thickly forested and malarial, and the routes to Kandy were kept secret and well-guarded.]]\n\nThe first Kandyan war was precipitated by the intrigues of a minister of [[Sri Vikrama Rajasinha|Sri Kalindu Delpachitre]] Pilimatalawe, who defected to the British and offered to show them the way through central Sri Lanka's winding mountain passes to the [[Kandy|capital city]]. Enraged, the kingdom of Mount lavinia had the minister's family executed.\n\nThe British dispatched two separate forces into Kandyan territory - one, under Major-General [[Hay MacDowall]], from [[Colombo]], and another, under a Colonel Barbut, from Trincomalee. These included [[King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry|51st Regiment of Foot]], the [[Green Howards|19th Regiment of Foot]], the Malay (Muslim) 1st Ceylon Regiment, the all-Sinhalese 2nd Ceylon, and the mixed Sinhalese Malay 3rd Ceylon. In the Kandyan army, at least one contingent was under the command of a Malay (and hence Muslim) prince called 'Sangunglo',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rootsweb.com/~lkawgw/malays1.htm |title=Malays |publisher=Rootsweb.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> an interesting commentary on the multiethnic nature of the mountainous kingdom. After fierce fighting the British force found Senkadagala deserted in February 1803. They swiftly established a garrison, crowned Muttusami as the new, puppet, king of Kandy, and set about subduing the remainder of the kingdom.\n\nDespite these early successes the army soon suffered a number of setbacks. The Chief Minister responsible for guiding the British into Kandy had greatly inflated the extent of the king's unpopularity, and resistance proved fierce. The Kandyans resorted to fighting a guerilla war (much the same tactic as they had adopted against the Portuguese and the Dutch) and proved difficult to dislodge.

Ehelepola had been involved in several intrigues against the by now deeply unpopular Sri Vikrama Rajasinghe since his appointment in 1810. In 1814 his actions were revealed and the noble fled to British territory.

Kandyan troops soon crossed the British-Kandyan border seeking Ehelepola, and attacked the British garrison at Sitawaka - of itself enough provocation for Brownrigg to dispatch a force to Kandy.<ref name=\"answers.com\"/> The situation was only worsened by the arrival of a group of British traders who Sri Vikrama Rajasingha had ordered mutilated at Hanguranketha.<ref name=\"lankalibrary.com\"/>\n\nThe British forces met scant resistance and entered Kandy on the 10th of February, 1815, accompanied by John d'Oyly; Brownrigg informed the Admiralty that 'Let by the invitation of the chiefs and welcomed by the acclamations of the people, the forces of His Britannic Majesty, have entered the Kandyan territory and penetrated to the capital. Divine Providence has blessed their efforts with uniform success and complete victory. The ruler of the interior provinces has fallen into their hands and the government remains at the disposal of His Majesty's Representative'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lankalibrary.com/geo/kandy4.htm |title=WWW Virtual Library - Sri Lanka: Haputale |publisher=Lankalibrary.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> Sometime later [[Sri Vikrama Rajasinghe]]'s hiding place was discovered; the deposed king was exiled with his harem, to [[Vellore Fort]] in [[India]], where he died 17 years later. His son, and potential heir, died childless in 1842.\n\nThe single most important event following the arrival of British forces in Kandy  was the signing of the [[Kandyan Convention]]. Essentially a treaty of annexation, it was agreed to in March 1815 after negotiations between John d'Oyly and the nobles of Kandy. The central points of the agreement were:\n\n# 'Sri Wickrema Rajasinha', the '[[Malabars|Malabari]]' king, [is] to forfeit all claims to the throne of Kandy.\n# The king is declared fallen and deposed and the hereditary claim of his dynasty, abolished and extinguished.\n# All his male relatives are banished from the island.\n# The dominion is vested in the sovereign of the British Empire, to be exercised through colonial governors, except in the case of the Adikarams, Disavas, Mohottalas, Korales, Vidanes and other subordinate officers reserving the rights, privileges and powers within their respective ranks.\n# The religion of Buddhism is declared inviolable and its rights to be maintained and protected.\n# All forms of physical torture and mutilations are abolished.\n# The governor alone can sentence a person to death and all capital publishments to take place in the presence of accredited agents of the government.\n# All civil and criminal justice over Kandyan to be administered according to the established norms and customs of the country, the government reserving to itself the rights of interposition when and where necessary.\n# Other non-Kandyan's position [is] to remain [as privileged as previously] according to British law.\n# The proclamation annexing the Three and Four Korales and Sabaragamuwa is repealed.\n# The dues and revenues to be collected for the King of England as well as for the maintenance of internal establishments in the island.\n# The Governor alone can facilitate trade and commerce.\n\nThe signatories of the convention were Governor Brownrigg, Ehelepola and the lords (called 'Dissawes' in [[Sinhalese language|Sinhalese]]) Molligoda, Pilimatalawe the Elder, Pilimatalawa the Younger, Monerawila, Molligoda the Younger, Dullewe, Ratwatte, Millawa, Galgama and Galegoda. The signatures were witnessed by d'Oyly, who became British Resident and effective governor in the area, and his private secretary James Sutherland.\n\nThe convention is interesting in many ways. It represents the theoretically voluntary transferral of authority in Kandy to the British, and indeed later events showed that the Kandyan nobility did hope that they were simply replacing one malleable master (the Nayakkar monarchy) with another (the British). Indeed, Ehelepola appears to have hoped that the new master would not be the British at all, but himself.<ref name=\"spur.asn.au\"/>\n\n[[Image:Zahntempel Kandy.jpg|right|thumb|175px|The Sri Dalada Maligawa, in Kandy, home to the sacred Tooth Relic of the Buddha. The Kandyan Convention afforded Buddhism 'protection', but less than fifty years later the British had constructed a church within the sacred precinct.]]\n\nThe nobles and religious potentates of Kandy were also adamant in including clause 5 concerning the protection of Buddhism. Later in 1815 the heads of the Buddhist monasteries at Malwatte and Asgiriya both met Governor Brownrigg and extracted guarantee that Buddhism would not be compromised.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rootsweb.com/~lkawgw/kandycon.html |title=The 1815 Kandyan Convention at the Audience Hall |publisher=Rootsweb.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> This included a ban on proselytising and mission schools.\n\n==Third war (1817\u20131818)==\n{{main article|Uva Rebellion}}\n\nIt took the ruling families of Kandy less than two years to realise that the authority of the British government was a fundamentally different beast to that of the (deposed) Nayakkar monarchy. Discontent with British activities soon boiled over into open rebellion, commencing in the duchy of Uva in 1817. Generally called the 'Uva Rebellion', it is also known as the [[Third Kandyan War]]. In many ways the third name is more appropriate, as the rebellion (which soon developed into a guerilla war of the kind the Kandyans had fought against European powers for some time) was centred on the Kandyan nobility and their unhappiness with developments under British rule since 1815. However it is the last uprising of this kind and Britain's response essentially liquidated the old aristocracy and ensured future rebellions would take on a much more subdued character.\n\nThe [[Ceylon Medal]] was instituted by the Ceylonese Government in 1819, the only gallantry medal struck for the Kandyan Wars.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Walsh|first1=Robin|title=16 June 1818: deaths of Private James Sutherland and Private William Chandler (73rd Regt)|url=https://www.mq.edu.au/macquarie-archive/under/documents/1818/4july.html|website=Under a Tropical Sun|publisher=Macquarie University|accessdate=30 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nThe British capture of the kingdom of Kandy marked not only the end of the 400-year-old Kingdom of Kandy, but also of all native political independence. Kandy, as a result of its geographical and political isolation, had developed unique cultural and social structures that were now subject to the intense pressures of subjugation and underwent immense upheaval and change.\n\nBefore 1815, much of Kandy's territory had been underdeveloped with unreliable dirt-track roads for access, apart from a few 'royal roads'. The British proceeded to transform the hill country by constructing roads across previously inaccessible terrain (such as the [[Kadugannawa_Pass#History|Kadugannawa Pass]]), and, in 1867, building the first railway. The other big transformation was the introduction of [[Ceylon tea|tea]] to central Sri Lanka in 1867 and the massive settlement of Tamils in the region. Central Sri Lanka is now dominated by the vast tea estates that helped make Sri Lanka the world's biggest exporter of tea for a while, and were still owned by British companies in 1971.\n\nA lasting legacy of the same war in [[Ireland]] is the traditional anti-war and anti-recruiting song \"[[Johnny I Hardly Knew Ye]]\", depicting a soldier from [[Athy]], [[County Kildare]] who comes home horribly mutilated from the war in \"Sulloon\" (Ceylon).\n\n==See also==\n* [[Matale rebellion]]\n* [[Kandyan Convention]]\n* [[Colonial history of Sri Lanka]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{citation |last=Powell |first=Geoffrey |title=The Kandyan Wars |location=London |year=1973}}\n* {{citation |last=Pieris |first=Ralph |title=Sinhalese Social Organization: The Kandyan Period |location=Colombo |year=1956}}\n* {{citation |last=Wickremesekara |first=Channa |title=Military Organisation in Pre-Modern Sri Lanka: The Army of the Kandyan Kings |year=2004 |journal=The Journal of South Asian Studies |volume=XXVII |number=2&nbsp;August 2004 |pages=133\u2013151 |doi=10.1080/1479027042000236616}}\n{{refend}}\n\n{{British colonial campaigns}}\n{{Armed Conflicts Involving Sri Lanka}}\n{{Kandyan period topics}}\n{{British Ceylon period topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kandyan Wars}}\n[[Category:Kandyan period]]\n[[Category:Wars involving Sri Lanka]]\n[[Category:Wars involving the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:19th-century military history of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:18th-century conflicts]]\n[[Category:19th-century conflicts]]\n[[Category:Kingdom of Kandy]]\n[[Category:History of Kandy]]\n[[Category:British Ceylon]]\n[[Category:19th century in Sri Lanka]]\n[[Category:18th century in Sri Lanka]]\n[[Category:1790s in Asia]]\n[[Category:1800s in Asia]]\n[[Category:1815 in Asia]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|British Army expeditionary campaigns}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{cleanup|reason=Terms and text like \"intrigues\", \"command of a Malay (and hence Muslim)\" \"Perhaps most worrying\" may have been OK for the 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, but not for 2017 Wikipedia|date=May 2017}}\n{{more citations needed|date=May 2017}}\n{{unreliable sources|date=May 2017}}\n}}\n{{infobox military conflict\n| conflict    = Kandyan Wars\n| partof      =\n| image       = Hindoostanmap1812.jpg\n| image_size  = 250px\n| caption     = The Indian subcontinent on the eve of the Second Kandyan War; the entirety of Sri Lanka is shown as being under British control, when in fact the kingdom of Kandy endured in the mountainous interior.\n| date        = 1796\u20131818\n| place       = [[Kingdom of Kandy]]\n| coordinates =\n| map_type    =\n| latitude    =\n| longitude   =\n| map_size    =\n| map_caption =\n| map_label   =\n| territory   =\n| result      = British victory\n* End of 2,357 years of Sinhalese independence<ref name=\"Wright\">{{cite book|last=Wright|first=Arnold|title=Twentieth century impressions of Ceylon: its history, people, commerce, industries, and resources|year=1999|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=978-81-206-1335-5|page=65|edition=2 (illustrated)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eUF_rS8FEoIC&dq=Twentieth+century+impressions+of+Ceylon:+its+history,+people,+commerce&source=gbs_navlinks_s}}</ref>\n| status      =\n| combatant1  = [[File:King of Kandy.svg|25px]] [[Kingdom of Kandy|Kandy]]\n| combatant2  = {{flag|British Empire}}\n| combatant3  =\n| commander1  = King [[Vikrama Rajasinha]]\nDissawa [[Lewke]]\n| commander2  ={{flagicon|Kingdom of Great Britain}}[[Frederick North, 5th Earl of Guilford]]<br>\n{{flagicon|Kingdom of Great Britain}} [[Hay MacDowall]]<br>{{flagicon|Kingdom of Great Britain}} [[Adam Davy (soldier)|Adam Davy]]<br>{{flagicon|Kingdom of Great Britain}} [[B.

More specifically it is used to describe the expeditionary campaigns of the [[British Army]] in the Kingdom of Kandy in 1803 and 1815.\n\n==Background==\nFrom 1638\u201358, the [[Dutch East India company]] had intervened in the [[Sinhalese\u2013Portuguese War]], capturing all the [[Portuguese Ceylon|Portuguese possessions on the island]] of [[Ceylon]] (now called Sri Lanka). They established the colony of [[Dutch Ceylon]], controlling the coasts and lowlands, whilst the [[Kingdom of Kandy]] maintained their independence in the mountainous eastern interior. In 1795 the [[Dutch Republic]] was [[Batavian Revolution|overthrown with French assistance]], forming the [[Batavian Republic]] as a [[puppet state]]. Britain, which was [[War of the First Coalition|at war with France]], feared that influence would result in French control or use of the strategically important port of [[Trincomalee]] and others on the island. Following the [[Kew Letters]] of 1795, the [[Invasion of Ceylon (1795)|British occupied Dutch possessions]] in Sri Lanka. These included not only Trincomalee but [[Batticaloa]], [[Galle]], and [[Jaffna]], as well as the entirety of Sri Lanka's lowlying coastal areas. The new colony of [[British Ceylon]] was determined to expand and control the entirety of the island, and had reformed traditional social structures like the caste system and the ''rajakariya'' (lit. \"kingwork\", labour and or tithes owed to the Kandyan king). This added to the tension between them and the still independent Kingdom of Kandy.\n\nMountainous central Sri Lanka remained independent, having resisted 250 years of European attempts to control Ceylon. Kandy was now under the rule of the [[Madurai Nayak Dynasty|Nayaka]] kings of [[Kandy|Senkadagala]]. Early British attempts at securing a treaty with mountainous kingdom were rejected.<ref>{{citation |last=Coddrington |first=Humphrey Eilliam |title=A Short History of Lanka |chapter=10 |year=1926 |publisher=Macmillan & Co |location=London |url=http://lakdiva.org/codrington/chap10.html}}. Retrieved on 23&nbsp;August 2008.</ref> The internal stability of Kandy was shaky, as king [[Sri Vikrama Rajasinha]] found himself being constantly undermined and intrigued against by powerful [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] nobles. He also faced a potential usurper in the form of Muttusami, brother-in-law of the previous king Rajadhirajasingha, who had fled to British controlled lands in the early 19th century and had been agitating against the beleaguered king ever since.<ref name=\"san.beck.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.san.beck.org/2-10-Marathas1707-1818.html|title=''san.beck.org''|publisher=|accessdate=23 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest British garrison numbered about 6,000 which was increased through the recruitment of local sepoys, and the forces of the Empire further enjoyed exclusive access to the sea. Kandy, in contrast, had the advantage of being situated in difficult, mountainous terrain, and could also draw on four hundred years of experience resisting European colonists.\n\n==First war (1803\u20131805)==\n[[Image:Central province1.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Terrain near Kandy; much of the Kingdom was mountainous, thickly forested and malarial, and the routes to Kandy were kept secret and well-guarded.]]\n\nThe first Kandyan war was precipitated by the intrigues of a minister of [[Sri Vikrama Rajasinha]], Pilimatalawe, who defected to the British and offered to show them the way through central Sri Lanka's winding mountain passes to the [[Kandy|capital city]]. Enraged, the [[King of Kandy]] had the minister's family executed.\n\nThe British dispatched two separate forces into Kandyan territory - one, under Major-General [[Hay MacDowall]], from [[Colombo]], and another, under a Colonel Barbut, from Trincomalee. These included [[King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry|51st Regiment of Foot]], the [[Green Howards|19th Regiment of Foot]], the Malay (Muslim) 1st Ceylon Regiment, the all-Sinhalese 2nd Ceylon, and the mixed Sinhalese Malay 3rd Ceylon. In the Kandyan army, at least one contingent was under the command of a Malay (and hence Muslim) prince called 'Sangunglo',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rootsweb.com/~lkawgw/malays1.htm |title=Malays |publisher=Rootsweb.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> an interesting commentary on the multiethnic nature of the mountainous kingdom. After fierce fighting the British force found Senkadagala deserted in February 1803. They swiftly established a garrison, crowned Muttusami as the new, puppet, king of Kandy, and set about subduing the remainder of the kingdom.\n\nDespite these early successes the army soon suffered a number of setbacks. The Chief Minister responsible for guiding the British into Kandy had greatly inflated the extent of the king's unpopularity, and resistance proved fierce. The Kandyans resorted to fighting a guerilla war (much the same tactic as they had adopted against the Portuguese and the Dutch) and proved difficult to dislodge. Disease ravaged the garrison left behind in Senkadagala to secure the capital. Perhaps most worrying for them, a number of native sepoys defected to the Kandyans, including a soldier of Malay descent called 'William O'Deen' or 'Odeen', who years later became the first Sri Lankan exiled to Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lankalibrary.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?p=805&sid=ed9e35ac4c934a2cb5636328ff7cab3b |title=LANKALIBRARY FORUM \u2022 View topic - Malayan Drum Major Odeen -1st Ceylonese Soldier in Australia |publisher=Lankalibrary.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2003/06/29/fea14.html |title=Online edition of Sunday Observer - Business |publisher=Sundayobserver.lk |date=2003-06-29 |accessdate=2012-08-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205003329/http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2003/06/29/fea14.html |archivedate=2012-02-05 }}</ref>\n\nThe Kandyans counter-attacked in March and seized Senkadagala.

Ehelepola had been involved in several intrigues against the by now deeply unpopular Sri Vikrama Rajasinghe since his appointment in 1810. In 1814 his actions were revealed and the noble fled to British territory. The furious king had Ehelepola's entire family put to death in various gruesome ways.<ref name=\"lankalibrary.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lankalibrary.com/geo/ehelepola3.htm |title=Ehelepola Medduma Bandara |publisher=Lankalibrary.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> The deaths shocked the Kandyan [[aristocracy]] who now openly revolted against the king, who torched his palace and fled to a fortress at [[Hanguranketha]].\n\nJohn d'Oyly, in the meanwhile, had been advising Governor Brownrigg for some time that Kandy's nobles were ready to cooperate with any British attempt at dislodging Sri Vikrama Rajasinghe. Kandyan troops soon crossed the British-Kandyan border seeking Ehelepola, and attacked the British garrison at Sitawaka - of itself enough provocation for Brownrigg to dispatch a force to Kandy.<ref name=\"answers.com\"/> The situation was only worsened by the arrival of a group of British traders who Sri Vikrama Rajasingha had ordered mutilated at Hanguranketha.<ref name=\"lankalibrary.com\"/>\n\nThe British forces met scant resistance and entered Kandy on the 10th of February, 1815, accompanied by John d'Oyly; Brownrigg informed the Admiralty that 'Let by the invitation of the chiefs and welcomed by the acclamations of the people, the forces of His Britannic Majesty, have entered the Kandyan territory and penetrated to the capital. Divine Providence has blessed their efforts with uniform success and complete victory. The ruler of the interior provinces has fallen into their hands and the government remains at the disposal of His Majesty's Representative'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lankalibrary.com/geo/kandy4.htm |title=WWW Virtual Library - Sri Lanka: Haputale |publisher=Lankalibrary.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> Sometime later [[Sri Vikrama Rajasinghe]]'s hiding place was discovered; the deposed king was exiled with his harem, to [[Vellore Fort]] in [[India]], where he died 17 years later. His son, and potential heir, died childless in 1842.\n\nThe single most important event following the arrival of British forces in Kandy  was the signing of the [[Kandyan Convention]]. Essentially a treaty of annexation, it was agreed to in March 1815 after negotiations between John d'Oyly and the nobles of Kandy. The central points of the agreement were:\n\n# 'Sri Wickrema Rajasinha', the '[[Malabars|Malabari]]' king, [is] to forfeit all claims to the throne of Kandy.\n# The king is declared fallen and deposed and the hereditary claim of his dynasty, abolished and extinguished.\n# All his male relatives are banished from the island.\n# The dominion is vested in the sovereign of the British Empire, to be exercised through colonial governors, except in the case of the Adikarams, Disavas, Mohottalas, Korales, Vidanes and other subordinate officers reserving the rights, privileges and powers within their respective ranks.\n# The religion of Buddhism is declared inviolable and its rights to be maintained and protected.\n# All forms of physical torture and mutilations are abolished.\n# The governor alone can sentence a person to death and all capital publishments to take place in the presence of accredited agents of the government.\n# All civil and criminal justice over Kandyan to be administered according to the established norms and customs of the country, the government reserving to itself the rights of interposition when and where necessary.\n# Other non-Kandyan's position [is] to remain [as privileged as previously] according to British law.\n# The proclamation annexing the Three and Four Korales and Sabaragamuwa is repealed.\n# The dues and revenues to be collected for the King of England as well as for the maintenance of internal establishments in the island.\n# The Governor alone can facilitate trade and commerce.\n\nThe signatories of the convention were Governor Brownrigg, Ehelepola and the lords (called 'Dissawes' in [[Sinhalese language|Sinhalese]]) Molligoda, Pilimatalawe the Elder, Pilimatalawa the Younger, Monerawila, Molligoda the Younger, Dullewe, Ratwatte, Millawa, Galgama and Galegoda. The signatures were witnessed by d'Oyly, who became British Resident and effective governor in the area, and his private secretary James Sutherland.\n\nThe convention is interesting in many ways. It represents the theoretically voluntary transferral of authority in Kandy to the British, and indeed later events showed that the Kandyan nobility did hope that they were simply replacing one malleable master (the Nayakkar monarchy) with another (the British). Indeed, Ehelepola appears to have hoped that the new master would not be the British at all, but himself.<ref name=\"spur.asn.au\"/>\n\n[[Image:Zahntempel Kandy.jpg|right|thumb|175px|The Sri Dalada Maligawa, in Kandy, home to the sacred Tooth Relic of the Buddha. The Kandyan Convention afforded Buddhism 'protection', but less than fifty years later the British had constructed a church within the sacred precinct.]]\n\nThe nobles and religious potentates of Kandy were also adamant in including clause 5 concerning the protection of Buddhism. Later in 1815 the heads of the Buddhist monasteries at Malwatte and Asgiriya both met Governor Brownrigg and extracted guarantee that Buddhism would not be compromised.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rootsweb.com/~lkawgw/kandycon.html |title=The 1815 Kandyan Convention at the Audience Hall |publisher=Rootsweb.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> This included a ban on proselytising and mission schools.\n\n==Third war (1817\u20131818)==\n{{main article|Uva Rebellion}}\n\nIt took the ruling families of Kandy less than two years to realise that the authority of the British government was a fundamentally different beast to that of the (deposed) Nayakkar monarchy. Discontent with British activities soon boiled over into open rebellion, commencing in the duchy of Uva in 1817. Generally called the 'Uva Rebellion', it is also known as the [[Third Kandyan War]]. In many ways the third name is more appropriate, as the rebellion (which soon developed into a guerilla war of the kind the Kandyans had fought against European powers for some time) was centred on the Kandyan nobility and their unhappiness with developments under British rule since 1815. However it is the last uprising of this kind and Britain's response essentially liquidated the old aristocracy and ensured future rebellions would take on a much more subdued character.\n\nThe [[Ceylon Medal]] was instituted by the Ceylonese Government in 1819, the only gallantry medal struck for the Kandyan Wars.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Walsh|first1=Robin|title=16 June 1818: deaths of Private James Sutherland and Private William Chandler (73rd Regt)|url=https://www.mq.edu.au/macquarie-archive/under/documents/1818/4july.html|website=Under a Tropical Sun|publisher=Macquarie University|accessdate=30 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nThe British capture of the kingdom of Kandy marked not only the end of the 400-year-old Kingdom of Kandy, but also of all native political independence. Kandy, as a result of its geographical and political isolation, had developed unique cultural and social structures that were now subject to the intense pressures of subjugation and underwent immense upheaval and change.\n\nBefore 1815, much of Kandy's territory had been underdeveloped with unreliable dirt-track roads for access, apart from a few 'royal roads'. The British proceeded to transform the hill country by constructing roads across previously inaccessible terrain (such as the [[Kadugannawa_Pass#History|Kadugannawa Pass]]), and, in 1867, building the first railway. The other big transformation was the introduction of [[Ceylon tea|tea]] to central Sri Lanka in 1867 and the massive settlement of Tamils in the region. Central Sri Lanka is now dominated by the vast tea estates that helped make Sri Lanka the world's biggest exporter of tea for a while, and were still owned by British companies in 1971.\n\nA lasting legacy of the same war in [[Ireland]] is the traditional anti-war and anti-recruiting song \"[[Johnny I Hardly Knew Ye]]\", depicting a soldier from [[Athy]], [[County Kildare]] who comes home horribly mutilated from the war in \"Sulloon\" (Ceylon).\n\n==See also==\n* [[Matale rebellion]]\n* [[Kandyan Convention]]\n* [[Colonial history of Sri Lanka]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{citation |last=Powell |first=Geoffrey |title=The Kandyan Wars |location=London |year=1973}}\n* {{citation |last=Pieris |first=Ralph |title=Sinhalese Social Organization: The Kandyan Period |location=Colombo |year=1956}}\n* {{citation |last=Wickremesekara |first=Channa |title=Military Organisation in Pre-Modern Sri Lanka: The Army of the Kandyan Kings |year=2004 |journal=The Journal of South Asian Studies |volume=XXVII |number=2&nbsp;August 2004 |pages=133\u2013151 |doi=10.1080/1479027042000236616}}\n{{refend}}\n\n{{British colonial campaigns}}\n{{Armed Conflicts Involving Sri Lanka}}\n{{Kandyan period topics}}\n{{British Ceylon period topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kandyan Wars}}\n[[Category:Kandyan period]]\n[[Category:Wars involving Sri Lanka]]\n[[Category:Wars involving the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:19th-century military history of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:18th-century conflicts]]\n[[Category:19th-century conflicts]]\n[[Category:Kingdom of Kandy]]\n[[Category:History of Kandy]]\n[[Category:British Ceylon]]\n[[Category:19th century in Sri Lanka]]\n[[Category:18th century in Sri Lanka]]\n[[Category:1790s in Asia]]\n[[Category:1800s in Asia]]\n[[Category:1815 in Asia]]\n", "name_user": "113.59.217.103", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Kalindu)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kandyan_Wars"}
