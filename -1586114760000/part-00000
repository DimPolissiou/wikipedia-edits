It was preceded by a popular [[revolt]] against the Argentine government, rallying behind the motto \"All of them must go!\" ({{Lang-es|\u00a1Que se vayan todos!}}), which caused the [[resignation]] of then-president [[Fernando de la R\u00faa]], giving way to a period of political instability during which five government officials performed the duties of the [[President of Argentina|Argentinian presidency]]. This period of instability occurred during the larger period of crisis known as the [[1998\u20132002 Argentine great depression|Argentine great depression]], an economic, political, and social crisis that lasted from 1998 until 2002.\n\nThe December 2001 crisis was a direct response to the government's imposition of \"Corral\" policies ({{Lang-es|[[Corralito]]}}) at the behest of economic minister [[Domingo Cavallo]], which restricted people's ability to withdraw [[cash]] from banks. Rioting and protests became widespread on 19 December 2001, immediately following the president's declaration of a state of emergency and his resignation on the following day. A state of extreme institutional instability continued for the next twelve days, during which the successor president [[Adolfo Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1]] resigned as well. While the degree of instability subsided, the events of December 2001 would become a blow against the legitimacy of the [[Argentine government]] that would persist for the following years.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe majority of the participants in the protests were unaffiliated with any political party or organization. Over the course of the protests, 39 people were killed by [[police]] and security forces. Of the 39 killed, nine were [[Minor (law)|minors]], which is an indication of the degree of repression ordered by the government to oppose the protests.\n\n== Background ==\n{{History of Argentina}}\n\n=== The Argentinian economy ===\n{{Main article|1998\u20132002 Argentine great depression}}[[Fernando de la R\u00faa]], as the candidate for the [[Alliance for Work, Justice and Education]] , had assumed the role of president in December 1999 in the middle of a recession, which was caused in part by the [[Convertibility plan]] ({{Lang-es|Ley de Convertibilidad}}) passed in 1991 which pegged the value of the [[Argentine peso]] to the [[United States dollar]].\n\nWhile political reforms under the previous president [[Carlos Menem]] had succeeded in reducing [[inflation]], the downsides of his economic policies became more and more apparent starting in 1997.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} Maintaining the convertibility of pesos to dollars required the government of Argentina to obtain an abundant supply of American dollars. At first, this supply was maintained by the [[privatization]] of nearly all of the Argentinian [[State (polity)|state's]] industries and [[pension]] funds. As the privatization process was completed, Argentina's [[agriculture]] [[export]]-based economy was unable to maintain a sufficient flow of dollars to the state, and the system began to require more and more [[sovereign debt]].\n\n=== Fernando de la R\u00faa's presidency ===\nOne of the key factors leading to the victory of the ''Alliance'' in the 1999 elections was its promise to uphold the convertibility plan. One of de la R\u00faa's campaign slogans declared \"With me, one peso, one dollar\" ({{Lang-es|Conmigo, un peso, un d\u00f3lar}}). Despite a changing international economic situation (including economic downturns in [[Brazil]], one of Argentina's key economic partners), and mounting demands for increased [[monetary sovereignty]],{{By whom|date=April 2018}} the ''Alliance'' committed itself to maintain the status quo at all costs.\n\n==== October 2000 Crisis ====\nDe la R\u00faa's political situation was precarious. His arrival to power in 1999 had been possible thanks to the [[Alliance for Work, Justice and Education]]  ({{Lang-es|Alianza para el Trabajo, la Justicia y la Educaci\u00f3n}}), a coalition formed by the [[Radical Civic Union]] and the [[Front for a Country in Solidarity|FrePaSo]], which managed to defeat the incumbent [[Justicialist Party]] (the [[Peronism|Peronist]] party) in that year's presidential elections. However, the Alliance (as it was known) failed to achieve a majority in the [[Argentine Senate|Senate]] and the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]], and lost the provincial elections to the Peronists, who then remained in charge of large and critical districts such as the [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]], [[C\u00f3rdoba Province (Argentina)|C\u00f3rdoba]] and [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]] provinces.\n\nThe government coalition was strained from the first moment; the FrePaSo leaders resented being \"junior members\" of the government (being forced to that position after losing their bid to the Governorship of Buenos Aires), while the Radicals were divided between their left- and right-leaning factions (De la R\u00faa was a leader of the party's conservatives), especially regarding economic policy. In late 2000 a [[political scandal]] broke out when it was reported that [[Secretar\u00eda de Inteligencia|SIDE]], Argentina's [[intelligence service]], had paid massive [[bribe]]s to a number of senators to approve a controversial Labor Reform Act. The head of SIDE, Fernando de Santiba\u00f1es, was a personal friend of De la R\u00faa. The crisis came to a head on October 2000 when Vice President [[Carlos \u00c1lvarez (vice-president)|Carlos \u00c1lvarez]] resigned, citing De la R\u00faa's unwillingness to tackle corruption.\n\n==== March 2001 Crisis ====\nDe la R\u00faa's economic policies suffered a severe blow in March 2001 when Economy Minister [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Machinea]] resigned from office. He was briefly replaced by the then-Defense Minister [[Ricardo L\u00f3pez Murphy]], who himself was forced to resign following negative reception to his shock program. After only two weeks in office, L\u00f3pez Murphy was replaced by [[Domingo Cavallo]], who had previously served as Economy Minister between 1991 and 1996, and who was the original author of the Convertibility plan during Menem's presidency.\n\nBecause of the worsening economic situation and mounting foreign debt, the government enacted two enormous campaigns of debt-expansion and [[refinancing]] under the supervision of the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), named \"The armoring\" ({{Lang-es|El blindaje}}) and \"The [[Megacanje|Megaexchange]]\"  ({{Lang-es|El Megacanje}}) respectively. From the first moment, there were allegations of corruption and [[money laundering]] about the ''megacanje''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe crisis also caused the resignation of all the FrePaSo Cabinet ministers, leaving de la R\u00faa without political support. The [[Elections in Argentina, 2001|congressional elections of October 2001]] were a disaster for the government, which lost many of its seats in the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies to the Peronists. The election results marked also a growing unrest within Argentina's voters, who took to cast millions of null or blank votes. The Peronists seized the opportunity to appoint Senator [[Ram\u00f3n Puerta]] to be President Pro-Tempore of the Argentine Senate, a situation which added to De la R\u00faa's political weakness since in the Argentine system the President Pro-Tempore of the Senate is next in line for the Presidency after the Vice President. With no Vice President of its own, Puerta's designation meant that De la R\u00faa had a virtual Peronist Vice President.\n\nSocial unrest was also growing. Since the late 1990s, protest movements had formed in Argentina, notably the [[piquetero]]s (\"picketeers\"), initially made up of unemployed workers. The piqueteros [[blockade]]d major roads and highways demanding government subsidies and other [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] measures. They featured prominently during the March 2001 crisis.\n\nThe crisis reached a breaking point on 29 November 2001, as major [[investor]]s began to withdraw their deposits from the banks, summarily causing the collapse of the Argentinian banking system due to [[capital flight]]. This was compounded by the IMF's decision to refuse to refinance Argentina's debt.\n\n=== Corralito ===\n{{main article|Corralito}}\nAt the beginning of December 2001, the IMF cut off the flow of funds to Argentina and capital flight became uncontrollable, with 25% of all the money in Argentinian banks having been withdrawn since the beginning of 2001. On 2 December, Finance Minister Cavallo announced a national cash-withdrawal limit of $250/week. Popular opinion was very negative, especially amongst the [[middle class]] (bearing in mind that the weekly withdrawal limit was higher than the total savings of the majority of the Argentinian population), for whom the economic crisis caused a breach of political confidence. Protests were held throughout December, although the largest and most important protests were those held on 19 and 20 December.\n\nAlthough people could still use their money via [[credit card]]s, [[cheque|check]]s and other forms of non-cash payments, the enforcement of these measures caused delays and problems for the general population and especially for businesses. Massive queues at every bank and growing reports of political crisis contributed to inflame Argentina's political scenario.\n\nDe la R\u00faa's position had become unsustainable, and an attempt by the [[Catholic Church]] to mediate between the government and the opposition in mid-December failed. Between 16 and 19 December there were several incidents involving unemployed activists and protesters which demanded the handing-out of food bags from supermarkets. These incidents ended up with outright looting of [[supermarket]]s and [[convenience store]]s on 18 December, taking place on [[Rosario]] and the [[Greater Buenos Aires]] areas.\n\n=== General strike and looting ===\nOn 13 December, the [[General Confederation of Labour (Argentina)|General Confederation of Labour]] and the [[Argentine Workers' Central Union]] declared their seventh [[general strike]] against the policies of de la R\u00faa's government. The strike had a high participation rate, including strikes in sectors that rarely participated in general strikes, such as the [[financial sector]] and un-[[unionized]] workplaces.\n\nDuring the time of the strike, there were riots in the [[working class]] neighborhoods of some cities, largely instigated by the striking ''piqueteros''. Looting occurred in various commercial districts in the country's interior and in [[Buenos Aires]]. Thousands of people participated in looting, truck-robbery, and street-blocking. From 13 to 19 December, seven people were killed by security forces and shopowners.\n\n== 19 December ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2007}}\n[[File:De.la.rua.ogv|thumb|250px|right|19 December 2001, [[President of Argentina|President]] [[Fernando de la R\u00faa|De la R\u00faa]] declares the [[state of emergency|state of siege]] throughout the country. Following the broadcast, a strong \"[[cacerolazo]]\" took place in Buenos Aires and other major cities of Argentina, and thousands took the streets and main plazas in protest. (video in Spanish)]]\n\nThroughout the day new lootings took place, and the Government believed that Peronist agitators were fueling the protests, especially in the province of [[Province of Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires]]. This came after noting that the lootings often took place in Peronist-governed towns, and that the [[Buenos Aires Provincial Police]] (which ultimately answered to Buenos Aires Governor [[Carlos Ruckauf]], a top Peronist) was strangely mild in restoring order. With violence mounting across Argentina's major cities, President De la R\u00faa began to consider alternative measures to restore order.\n\nThe first option considered was to deploy the military to contain the violence. However, Argentine legislation forbids military intervention in domestic security matters unless the police and security forces are overwhelmed, a situation quickly pointed out by the Chairman of the Joint General Staff and the Chiefs of Staff of the [[Argentine Army|Army]], [[Argentine Navy|Navy]] and [[Argentine Air Force|Air Force]]. The military also pointed out that they would only intervene if their deployment was authorized by a law voted in Congress, something impossible given the Peronist majority in both Houses. The Argentine military was unwilling to take the blame if violence grew worse, learning from what had previously happened when President [[Isabel Per\u00f3n]] issued an [[Operativo_Independencia#February_1975_\"annihilation_decree\"|executive order commanding them to fight the subversive guerrilla]] movements of the 1970s (see [[Dirty War]]).\n\nWith military intervention no longer an option, De la R\u00faa resorted to declare a [[state of siege]] (essentially a [[state of emergency]]) throughout the country, deploying the [[Polic\u00eda Federal Argentina|Federal Police]], the [[Gendarmer\u00eda Nacional Argentina|National Gendarmerie]] (border guard) and the [[Prefectura Naval Argentina|Naval Prefecture]] (coast guard) to contain the growing violence.\n\nLater that night, De la R\u00faa addressed the nation to announce the state of siege and to call the Peronists to negotiate a \"government of national unity\". Following the broadcast, spontaneous ''[[cacerolazo]]s'' (\"pot banging\") took place throughout Buenos Aires and other major cities, signaling the middle-class' own unrest. 19 December concluded with the resignation of Domingo Cavallo, who had lost whatever support he had within the government. Groups of protesters mobilized throughout Buenos Aires, some of them arriving to [[Plaza de Mayo]], where there were incidents with the Federal Police forces.\n\n== 20 December ==\n[[File:Crisis 20 diciembre 2001.jpg|thumb|Police intervention in the conflict]]\n\nWhat had begun as rioting by unemployed and leftist-leaning groups had turned into a middle-class protest with the ''cacerolazos'', and the resignation of Cavallo did nothing to calm down the situation.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1721201.stm Crisis grips Argentina] [[BBC News]], 20 December 2001</ref> The De la R\u00faa administration had agreed with the military to participate in an emergency handing-out of food, however, the plan failed due to lack of cooperation from the Ministry of Social Development.\n\nThroughout the morning, groups of protesters converged on Plaza de Mayo despite the state of siege.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1720607.stm Argentina plunges into turmoil] BBC News, 20 December 2001</ref> The [[Argentine Federal Police|Federal Police]], acting under orders from the government, proceeded to try to control the protests. An attempt by a federal judge to halt police operations was disregarded, and the situation worsened with the arrival of new groups of protesters.\n\nAs violence expanded, President De la R\u00faa tried to impose censorship on all news outlets from Buenos Aires. The idea was to use the state of siege to force the television networks to stop transmitting current events and broadcast emergency programming. This plan also failed because De la R\u00faa's own Media Secretary refused to carry out his instructions. The state's repression was thus broadcast both within Argentina and abroad, causing further mobilizations toward the Plaza.\n\nViolent incidents between the police and protesters spread throughout the country. The most notorious ones took place at the Plaza de Mayo, where five people were killed. Some claim that the deaths were provoked by covert elements of the [[Buenos Aires Provincial Police]] in an attempt to further destabilize De la R\u00faa.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nWith his options steadily being reduced, De la R\u00faa went onto national television at 4 p.m. to offer the Peronists to join the government and try to bring some peace to the country. At that time, a caucus of Peronist governors was taking place at a country villa in the province of [[San Luis Province|San Luis]]. Three hours later, Humberto Roggero, head of the Peronist bloc of the House of Deputies, announced that the Peronist Party would not be a part of a \"government of national unity\".\n\nWhen he heard the Peronists' response, De la R\u00faa decided to resign from office.<ref>[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0A12FC355A0C728EDDAB0994D9404482 \"Argentine Leader, his Nation frayed, abruptly resigns\"]  by Clifford Krauss. ''[[The New York Times]]'', 21 December 2001</ref> The situation on Plaza de Mayo (right in front of the [[Casa Rosada]], the Presidential Palace) was still too violent for De la R\u00faa to leave by car to his official residence at Olivos. Thus, the President's security detail decided to take him out of the Casa Rosada on board an Air Force helicopter. The iconic{{cn|date=October 2019}} images of De la R\u00faa's \"escape\" by helicopter were broadcast throughout the country.\nThe violence slowly abated. By the end of the day, 26 people had died, five of them in Buenos Aires. \n\nWith \u00c1lvarez having resigned a year earlier, the President Pro-Tempore of the Senate, [[Ram\u00f3n Puerta]], took over as Interim President until Congress could appoint a successor to De la R\u00faa.\n\n=== Victims and criminal investigation ===\n{{See also|Pocho Lepratti}}\nAll told, 36 people were killed by police forces during the December riots, including 7 children. The largest incidence of violence was in the Plaza de Mayo of Buenos Aires, in what would become known in Argentina as the \"Plaza de Mayo Massacre\" ({{Lang-es|Masacre de Plaza de Mayo}}), where 5 people were killed and 227 were injured. These crimes were investigated and brought to court. Seventeen people were charged with murder, attempted murder, including the then-Secretary of Security Enrique Mathov and the former head of the Argentinian Federal Police, Ruben Santos.\n\nWhile various officials and police officers have been charged and sentenced to prison, as of 2016 the majority of cases pertaining to violence during the December riots have not moved forward.\n\n== Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1 Administration ==\n[[File:Adolfo Rodr\u00edguez Saa.JPG|thumb|[[Adolfo Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1]] at his office in the ''[[Casa Rosada]]'']]\nAccording to the Acephaly Act, Puerta would only be President until the Legislative Assembly (a joint session of the Senate and the House of Deputies) convened and appointed a new President from either one member of Congress or a provincial governor to complete the resigning President's period.\n\nThe Peronist governors assembled at San Luis -arguably the most powerful men in Argentina at the period- were divided on whom to nominate. There were three \"natural candidates\", who were the governors of the three largest provinces: [[Carlos Ruckauf]] of Buenos Aires, [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel de la Sota]] of [[C\u00f3rdoba Province (Argentina)|C\u00f3rdoba]] and [[Carlos Reutemann]] of [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]]. As a temporary arrangement, the governors decided to nominate [[Adolfo Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1]], Governor of San Luis. The Peronists' easy majority in both houses of Congress ensured that Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1 was elected on 22 December.\n\nWhile de la R\u00faa's term expired in 2003, some argued that only a president legitimated by popular vote would be able to bring Argentina out of the crisis. To that end, Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1 was designated as interim president for only three months, until presidential elections were held on 3 March. If needed, a [[ballotage in Argentina|ballotage]] would be held on 17 March. The winner would take office on 5 April for the balance of de la R\u00faa's term. \n\nHowever, Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1 didn't seem at all satisfied with being a caretaker president. From the first moment, Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1 embarked on ambitious projects aimed at giving him popularity. In his inaugural speech, he announced that Argentina would [[default (finance)|default]] on its foreign debt, an announcement received by rousing applause from the members of Congress. He then proceeded to announce the issuing of a \"third currency\" (alongside the peso and the dollar) to boost consumption. Later on, Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1 announced that he would extradite every former military officer charged with human rights abuses during the Dirty War who was requested by foreign courts. Another measure was to stand down the state of siege.\n\nThere were also some unpopular designations to the Cabinet. The most notorious one was the appointment of former Mayor of Buenos Aires [[Carlos Grosso]], arguably one of the most corrupt figures in Argentine politics. Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1 also courted the powerful Peronist [[trade unions]] in a move that was recognized as an attempt to wrestle power from the other Peronist governors.\n\nNew riots and ''cacerolazos'' took place on Buenos Aires, with some protesters entering the Congress Palace and burning furniture. On 30 December, Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1 called for a summit of Peronist governors at the Presidential holiday retreat of Chapadmalal, {{convert|19|km|abbr=off}} south of [[Mar del Plata]]. Of the fourteen Peronist governors, only five attended. Realizing that he lacked support from his own party, Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1 returned to his home province to announce his own resignation to the Presidency after barely a week in office.\n\n== Designation of Eduardo Duhalde ==\n[[Image:Duhalde.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Former President Eduardo Duhalde (2002\u20132003)]]\nRam\u00f3n Puerta refused to take over as interim President again, resigning as President Pro-Tempore of the Senate. With no President, Vice President or President Pro-Tempore of the Senate, the Presidency of Argentina was placed in the hands of the next-in-line: [[Eduardo Cama\u00f1o]], who was the Speaker of the House of Deputies.\n\nCama\u00f1o was to take over until a new Legislative Assembly was convened. The Assembly convened on 1 January 2002, and debated extensively before designating Senator [[Eduardo Duhalde]] as President almost at midnight.\n\nDuhalde was one of the top leaders of the Peronist Party. However, many had thought that Duhalde's political career was ruined after his defeat in the [[Elections in Argentina, 1999|1999 presidential elections]]. In an ironic twist of events, Duhalde was called to complete the term of the man who beat him in the elections, Fernando de la R\u00faa. This was not to be a provisional presidency, as Duhalde was designated to complete the interrupted term of De la R\u00faa until the [[Elections in Argentina, 2003|2003 presidential elections]].\n\nWith regard to the economy Duhalde and his Economy Minister [[Jorge Remes Lenicov]] decided on an even more extreme freezing of the bank deposits, which was then coupled with the so-called ''pesificaci\u00f3n'' (\"peso-ification\", a forced transformation of all dollar-denominated accounts into pesos at an arbitrary fixed [[exchange rate]]), and a regulated [[devaluation]]. The fixed exchange rate system was abandoned soon afterwards, which was followed by a large [[depreciation (currency)|depreciation]].\n\n== Social changes ==\nDuring the unrest millions of people formed [[Participatory democracy|neighbourhood assemblies]], occupied unused land and factories, created [[barter]] and [[Mutual aid (organization theory)|mutual aid]] networks, implemented workers' self-management across hundreds of factories and rejected trade unionism and political parties.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Que Se Vayan Todos: Argentina's Popular Rebellion|last=Whitney|first=Jennifer|publisher=Kersplebedeb|year=2003|isbn=|location=Montreal|pages=56}}</ref> Around a third of the population participated in these creations and these efforts have been repeatedly praised by [[Anarchism|anarchists]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Anarchy Works|last=Gelderloos|first=Peter|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[1989 riots in Argentina]]\n* [[List of cases of police brutality in Argentina]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Sources and further reading ==\n* {{cite book \n|last= Reato\n|first= Ceferino\n|date= 2015\n|title= Doce noches\n|trans-title= Twelve nights\n|language= Spanish\n|location= Argentina\n|publisher= Sudamericana\n|isbn= 978-950-07-5203-9}}\n* {{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/americas/12/19/argentina.riots/ |title=Argentina in state of siege after deadly riots |publisher=CNN.com |date=20 December 2001}}\n* {{cite web |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/americas/12/20/argentina/index.html |title=Argentina teeters on possible economic collapse |publisher=CNN.com |date=21 December 2001 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024022128/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/americas/12/20/argentina/index.html |archivedate=24 October 2007 }}\n* {{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1721103.stm |title=The events that triggered Argentina's crisis |publisher=BBC News -

It was preceded by a popular [[revolt]] against the Argentine government, rallying behind the motto \"All of them must go!\" ({{Lang-es|\u00a1Que se vayan todos!}}), which caused the [[resignation]] of then-president [[Fernando de la R\u00faa]], giving way to a period of political instability during which five government officials performed the duties of the [[President of Argentina|Argentinian presidency]]. This period of instability occurred during the larger period of crisis known as the [[1998\u20132002 Argentine great depression|Argentine great depression]], an economic, political, and social crisis that lasted from 1998 until 2002.\n\nThe December 2001 crisis was a direct response to the government's imposition of \"Corral\" policies ({{Lang-es|[[Corralito]]}}) at the behest of economic minister [[Domingo Cavallo]], which restricted people's ability to withdraw [[cash]] from banks. Rioting and protests became widespread on 19 December 2001, immediately following the president's declaration of a state of emergency and his resignation on the following day. A state of extreme institutional instability continued for the next twelve days, during which the successor president [[Adolfo Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1]] resigned as well. While the degree of instability subsided, the events of December 2001 would become a blow against the legitimacy of the [[Argentine government]] that would persist for the following years.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe majority of the participants in the protests were unaffiliated with any political party or organization. Over the course of the protests, 39 people were killed by [[police]] and security forces. Of the 39 killed, nine were [[Minor (law)|minors]], which is an indication of the degree of repression ordered by the government to oppose the protests.\n\n== Background ==\n{{History of Argentina}}\n\n=== The Argentinian economy ===\n{{Main article|1998\u20132002 Argentine great depression}}[[Fernando de la R\u00faa]], as the candidate for the [[Alliance for Work, Justice and Education]] , had assumed the role of president in December 1999 in the middle of a recession, which was caused in part by the [[Convertibility plan]] ({{Lang-es|Ley de Convertibilidad}}) passed in 1991 which pegged the value of the [[Argentine peso]] to the [[United States dollar]].\n\nWhile political reforms under the previous president [[Carlos Menem]] had succeeded in reducing [[inflation]], the downsides of his economic policies became more and more apparent starting in 1997.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} Maintaining the convertibility of pesos to dollars required the government of Argentina to obtain an abundant supply of American dollars. At first, this supply was maintained by the [[privatization]] of nearly all of the Argentinian [[State (polity)|state's]] industries and [[pension]] funds. As the privatization process was completed, Argentina's [[agriculture]] [[export]]-based economy was unable to maintain a sufficient flow of dollars to the state, and the system began to require more and more [[sovereign debt]].\n\n=== Fernando de la R\u00faa's presidency ===\nOne of the key factors leading to the victory of the ''Alliance'' in the 1999 elections was its promise to uphold the convertibility plan. One of de la R\u00faa's campaign slogans declared \"With me, one peso, one dollar\" ({{Lang-es|Conmigo, un peso, un d\u00f3lar}}). Despite a changing international economic situation (including economic downturns in [[Brazil]], one of Argentina's key economic partners), and mounting demands for increased [[monetary sovereignty]],{{By whom|date=April 2018}} the ''Alliance'' committed itself to maintain the status quo at all costs.\n\n==== October 2000 Crisis ====\nDe la R\u00faa's political situation was precarious. His arrival to power in 1999 had been possible thanks to the [[Alliance for Work, Justice and Education]]  ({{Lang-es|Alianza para el Trabajo, la Justicia y la Educaci\u00f3n}}), a coalition formed by the [[Radical Civic Union]] and the [[Front for a Country in Solidarity|FrePaSo]], which managed to defeat the incumbent [[Justicialist Party]] (the [[Peronism|Peronist]] party) in that year's presidential elections. However, the Alliance (as it was known) failed to achieve a majority in the [[Argentine Senate|Senate]] and the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]], and lost the provincial elections to the Peronists, who then remained in charge of large and critical districts such as the [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]], [[C\u00f3rdoba Province (Argentina)|C\u00f3rdoba]] and [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]] provinces.\n\nThe government coalition was strained from the first moment; the FrePaSo leaders resented being \"junior members\" of the government (being forced to that position after losing their bid to the Governorship of Buenos Aires), while the Radicals were divided between their left- and right-leaning factions (De la R\u00faa was a leader of the party's conservatives), especially regarding economic policy. In late 2000 a [[political scandal]] broke out when it was reported that [[Secretar\u00eda de Inteligencia|SIDE]], Argentina's [[intelligence service]], had paid massive [[bribe]]s to a number of senators to approve a controversial Labor Reform Act. The head of SIDE, Fernando de Santiba\u00f1es, was a personal friend of De la R\u00faa. The crisis came to a head on October 2000 when Vice President [[Carlos \u00c1lvarez (vice-president)|Carlos \u00c1lvarez]] resigned, citing De la R\u00faa's unwillingness to tackle corruption.\n\n==== March 2001 Crisis ====\nDe la R\u00faa's economic policies suffered a severe blow in March 2001 when Economy Minister [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Machinea]] resigned from office. He was briefly replaced by the then-Defense Minister [[Ricardo L\u00f3pez Murphy]], who himself was forced to resign following negative reception to his shock program. After only two weeks in office, L\u00f3pez Murphy was replaced by [[Domingo Cavallo]], who had previously served as Economy Minister between 1991 and 1996, and who was the original author of the Convertibility plan during Menem's presidency.\n\nBecause of the worsening economic situation and mounting foreign debt, the government enacted two enormous campaigns of debt-expansion and [[refinancing]] under the supervision of the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), named \"The armoring\" ({{Lang-es|El blindaje}}) and \"The [[Megacanje|Megaexchange]]\"  ({{Lang-es|El Megacanje}}) respectively. From the first moment, there were allegations of corruption and [[money laundering]] about the ''megacanje''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe crisis also caused the resignation of all the FrePaSo Cabinet ministers, leaving de la R\u00faa without political support. The [[Elections in Argentina, 2001|congressional elections of October 2001]] were a disaster for the government, which lost many of its seats in the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies to the Peronists. The election results marked also a growing unrest within Argentina's voters, who took to cast millions of null or blank votes. The Peronists seized the opportunity to appoint Senator [[Ram\u00f3n Puerta]] to be President Pro-Tempore of the Argentine Senate, a situation which added to De la R\u00faa's political weakness since in the Argentine system the President Pro-Tempore of the Senate is next in line for the Presidency after the Vice President. With no Vice President of its own, Puerta's designation meant that De la R\u00faa had a virtual Peronist Vice President.\n\nSocial unrest was also growing. Since the late 1990s, protest movements had formed in Argentina, notably the [[piquetero]]s (\"picketeers\"), initially made up of unemployed workers. The piqueteros [[blockade]]d major roads and highways demanding government subsidies and other [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] measures. They featured prominently during the March 2001 crisis.\n\nThe crisis reached a breaking point on 29 November 2001, as major [[investor]]s began to withdraw their deposits from the banks, summarily causing the collapse of the Argentinian banking system due to [[capital flight]]. This was compounded by the IMF's decision to refuse to refinance Argentina's debt.\n\n=== Corralito ===\n{{main article|Corralito}}\nAt the beginning of December 2001, the IMF cut off the flow of funds to Argentina and capital flight became uncontrollable, with 25% of all the money in Argentinian banks having been withdrawn since the beginning of 2001. On 2 December, Finance Minister Cavallo announced a national cash-withdrawal limit of $250/week. Popular opinion was very negative, especially amongst the [[middle class]] (bearing in mind that the weekly withdrawal limit was higher than the total savings of the majority of the Argentinian population), for whom the economic crisis caused a breach of political confidence. Protests were held throughout December, although the largest and most important protests were those held on 19 and 20 December.\n\nAlthough people could still use their money via [[credit card]]s, [[cheque|check]]s and other forms of non-cash payments, the enforcement of these measures caused delays and problems for the general population and especially for businesses. Massive queues at every bank and growing reports of political crisis contributed to inflame Argentina's political scenario.\n\nDe la R\u00faa's position had become unsustainable, and an attempt by the [[Catholic Church]] to mediate between the government and the opposition in mid-December failed. Between 16 and 19 December there were several incidents involving unemployed activists and protesters which demanded the handing-out of food bags from supermarkets. These incidents ended up with outright looting of [[supermarket]]s and [[convenience store]]s on 18 December, taking place on [[Rosario]] and the [[Greater Buenos Aires]] areas.\n\n=== General strike and looting ===\nOn 13 December, the [[General Confederation of Labour (Argentina)|General Confederation of Labour]] and the [[Argentine Workers' Central Union]] declared their seventh [[general strike]] against the policies of de la R\u00faa's government. The strike had a high participation rate, including strikes in sectors that rarely participated in general strikes, such as the [[financial sector]] and un-[[unionized]] workplaces.\n\nDuring the time of the strike, there were riots in the [[working class]] neighborhoods of some cities, largely instigated by the striking ''piqueteros''. Looting occurred in various commercial districts in the country's interior and in [[Buenos Aires]]. Thousands of people participated in looting, truck-robbery, and street-blocking. From 13 to 19 December, seven people were killed by security forces and shopowners.\n\n== 19 December ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2007}}\n[[File:De.la.rua.ogv|thumb|250px|right|19 December 2001, [[President of Argentina|President]] [[Fernando de la R\u00faa|De la R\u00faa]] declares the [[state of emergency|state of siege]] throughout the country. Following the broadcast, a strong \"[[cacerolazo]]\" took place in Buenos Aires and other major cities of Argentina, and thousands took the streets and main plazas in protest. (video in Spanish)]]\n\nThroughout the day new lootings took place, and the Government believed that Peronist agitators were fueling the protests, especially in the province of [[Province of Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires]]. This came after noting that the lootings often took place in Peronist-governed towns, and that the [[Buenos Aires Provincial Police]] (which ultimately answered to Buenos Aires Governor [[Carlos Ruckauf]], a top Peronist) was strangely mild in restoring order. With violence mounting across Argentina's major cities, President De la R\u00faa began to consider alternative measures to restore order.\n\nThe first option considered was to deploy the military to contain the violence. However, Argentine legislation forbids military intervention in domestic security matters unless the police and security forces are overwhelmed, a situation quickly pointed out by the Chairman of the Joint General Staff and the Chiefs of Staff of the [[Argentine Army|Army]], [[Argentine Navy|Navy]] and [[Argentine Air Force|Air Force]]. The military also pointed out that they would only intervene if their deployment was authorized by a law voted in Congress, something impossible given the Peronist majority in both Houses. The Argentine military was unwilling to take the blame if violence grew worse, learning from what had previously happened when President [[Isabel Per\u00f3n]] issued an [[Operativo_Independencia#February_1975_\"annihilation_decree\"|executive order commanding them to fight the subversive guerrilla]] movements of the 1970s (see [[Dirty War]]).\n\nWith military intervention no longer an option, De la R\u00faa resorted to declare a [[state of siege]] (essentially a [[state of emergency]]) throughout the country, deploying the [[Polic\u00eda Federal Argentina|Federal Police]], the [[Gendarmer\u00eda Nacional Argentina|National Gendarmerie]] (border guard) and the [[Prefectura Naval Argentina|Naval Prefecture]] (coast guard) to contain the growing violence.\n\nLater that night, De la R\u00faa addressed the nation to announce the state of siege and to call the Peronists to negotiate a \"government of national unity\". Following the broadcast, spontaneous ''[[cacerolazo]]s'' (\"pot banging\") took place throughout Buenos Aires and other major cities, signaling the middle-class' own unrest. 19 December concluded with the resignation of Domingo Cavallo, who had lost whatever support he had within the government. Groups of protesters mobilized throughout Buenos Aires, some of them arriving to [[Plaza de Mayo]], where there were incidents with the Federal Police forces.\n\n== 20 December ==\n[[File:Crisis 20 diciembre 2001.jpg|thumb|Police intervention in the conflict]]\n\nWhat had begun as rioting by unemployed and leftist-leaning groups had turned into a middle-class protest with the ''cacerolazos'', and the resignation of Cavallo did nothing to calm down the situation.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1721201.stm Crisis grips Argentina] [[BBC News]], 20 December 2001</ref> The De la R\u00faa administration had agreed with the military to participate in an emergency handing-out of food, however, the plan failed due to lack of cooperation from the Ministry of Social Development.\n\nThroughout the morning, groups of protesters converged on Plaza de Mayo despite the state of siege.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1720607.stm Argentina plunges into turmoil] BBC News, 20 December 2001</ref> The [[Argentine Federal Police|Federal Police]], acting under orders from the government, proceeded to try to control the protests. An attempt by a federal judge to halt police operations was disregarded, and the situation worsened with the arrival of new groups of protesters.\n\nAs violence expanded, President De la R\u00faa tried to impose censorship on all news outlets from Buenos Aires. The idea was to use the state of siege to force the television networks to stop transmitting current events and broadcast emergency programming. This plan also failed because De la R\u00faa's own Media Secretary refused to carry out his instructions. The state's repression was thus broadcast both within Argentina and abroad, causing further mobilizations toward the Plaza.\n\nViolent incidents between the police and protesters spread throughout the country. The most notorious ones took place at the Plaza de Mayo, where five people were killed. Some claim that the deaths were provoked by covert elements of the [[Buenos Aires Provincial Police]] in an attempt to further destabilize De la R\u00faa.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nWith his options steadily being reduced, De la R\u00faa went onto national television at 4 p.m. to offer the Peronists to join the government and try to bring some peace to the country. At that time, a caucus of Peronist governors was taking place at a country villa in the province of [[San Luis Province|San Luis]]. Three hours later, Humberto Roggero, head of the Peronist bloc of the House of Deputies, announced that the Peronist Party would not be a part of a \"government of national unity\".\n\nWhen he heard the Peronists' response, De la R\u00faa decided to resign from office.<ref>[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0A12FC355A0C728EDDAB0994D9404482 \"Argentine Leader, his Nation frayed, abruptly resigns\"]  by Clifford Krauss. ''[[The New York Times]]'', 21 December 2001</ref> The situation on Plaza de Mayo (right in front of the [[Casa Rosada]], the Presidential Palace) was still too violent for De la R\u00faa to leave by car to his official residence at Olivos. Thus, the President's security detail decided to take him out of the Casa Rosada on board an Air Force helicopter. The iconic{{cn|date=October 2019}} images of De la R\u00faa's \"escape\" by helicopter were broadcast throughout the country.\nThe violence slowly abated. By the end of the day, 26 people had died, five of them in Buenos Aires. \n\nWith \u00c1lvarez having resigned a year earlier, the President Pro-Tempore of the Senate, [[Ram\u00f3n Puerta]], took over as Interim President until Congress could appoint a successor to De la R\u00faa.\n\n=== Victims and criminal investigation ===\n{{See also|Pocho Lepratti}}\nAll told, 36 people were killed by police forces during the December riots, including 7 children. The largest incidence of violence was in the Plaza de Mayo of Buenos Aires, in what would become known in Argentina as the \"Plaza de Mayo Massacre\" ({{Lang-es|Masacre de Plaza de Mayo}}), where 5 people were killed and 227 were injured. These crimes were investigated and brought to court. Seventeen people were charged with murder, attempted murder, including the then-Secretary of Security Enrique Mathov and the former head of the Argentinian Federal Police, Ruben Santos.\n\nWhile various officials and police officers have been charged and sentenced to prison, as of 2016 the majority of cases pertaining to violence during the December riots have not moved forward.\n\n== Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1 Administration ==\n[[File:Adolfo Rodr\u00edguez Saa.JPG|thumb|[[Adolfo Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1]] at his office in the ''[[Casa Rosada]]'']]\nAccording to the Acephaly Act, Puerta would only be President until the Legislative Assembly (a joint session of the Senate and the House of Deputies) convened and appointed a new President from either one member of Congress or a provincial governor to complete the resigning President's period.\n\nThe Peronist governors assembled at San Luis -arguably the most powerful men in Argentina at the period- were divided on whom to nominate. There were three \"natural candidates\", who were the governors of the three largest provinces: [[Carlos Ruckauf]] of Buenos Aires, [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel de la Sota]] of [[C\u00f3rdoba Province (Argentina)|C\u00f3rdoba]] and [[Carlos Reutemann]] of [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]]. As a temporary arrangement, the governors decided to nominate [[Adolfo Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1]], Governor of San Luis. The Peronists' easy majority in both houses of Congress ensured that Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1 was elected on 22 December.\n\nWhile de la R\u00faa's term expired in 2003, some argued that only a president legitimated by popular vote would be able to bring Argentina out of the crisis. To that end, Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1 was designated as interim president for only three months, until presidential elections were held on 3 March. If needed, a [[ballotage in Argentina|ballotage]] would be held on 17 March. The winner would take office on 5 April for the balance of de la R\u00faa's term. \n\nHowever, Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1 didn't seem at all satisfied with being a caretaker president. From the first moment, Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1 embarked on ambitious projects aimed at giving him popularity. In his inaugural speech, he announced that Argentina would [[default (finance)|default]] on its foreign debt, an announcement received by rousing applause from the members of Congress. He then proceeded to announce the issuing of a \"third currency\" (alongside the peso and the dollar) to boost consumption. Later on, Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1 announced that he would extradite every former military officer charged with human rights abuses during the Dirty War who was requested by foreign courts. Another measure was to stand down the state of siege.\n\nThere were also some unpopular designations to the Cabinet. The most notorious one was the appointment of former Mayor of Buenos Aires [[Carlos Grosso]], arguably one of the most corrupt figures in Argentine politics. Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1 also courted the powerful Peronist [[trade unions]] in a move that was recognized as an attempt to wrestle power from the other Peronist governors.\n\nNew riots and ''cacerolazos'' took place on Buenos Aires, with some protesters entering the Congress Palace and burning furniture. On 30 December, Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1 called for a summit of Peronist governors at the Presidential holiday retreat of Chapadmalal, {{convert|19|km|abbr=off}} south of [[Mar del Plata]]. Of the fourteen Peronist governors, only five attended. Realizing that he lacked support from his own party, Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1 returned to his home province to announce his own resignation to the Presidency after barely a week in office.\n\n== Designation of Eduardo Duhalde ==\n[[Image:Duhalde.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Former President Eduardo Duhalde (2002\u20132003)]]\nRam\u00f3n Puerta refused to take over as interim President again, resigning as President Pro-Tempore of the Senate. With no President, Vice President or President Pro-Tempore of the Senate, the Presidency of Argentina was placed in the hands of the next-in-line: [[Eduardo Cama\u00f1o]], who was the Speaker of the House of Deputies.\n\nCama\u00f1o was to take over until a new Legislative Assembly was convened. The Assembly convened on 1 January 2002, and debated extensively before designating Senator [[Eduardo Duhalde]] as President almost at midnight.\n\nDuhalde was one of the top leaders of the Peronist Party. However, many had thought that Duhalde's political career was ruined after his defeat in the [[Elections in Argentina, 1999|1999 presidential elections]]. In an ironic twist of events, Duhalde was called to complete the term of the man who beat him in the elections, Fernando de la R\u00faa. This was not to be a provisional presidency, as Duhalde was designated to complete the interrupted term of De la R\u00faa until the [[Elections in Argentina, 2003|2003 presidential elections]].\n\nWith regard to the economy Duhalde and his Economy Minister [[Jorge Remes Lenicov]] decided on an even more extreme freezing of the bank deposits, which was then coupled with the so-called ''pesificaci\u00f3n'' (\"peso-ification\", a forced transformation of all dollar-denominated accounts into pesos at an arbitrary fixed [[exchange rate]]), and a regulated [[devaluation]]. The fixed exchange rate system was abandoned soon afterwards, which was followed by a large [[depreciation (currency)|depreciation]].\n\n== Social changes ==\nDuring the unrest millions of people formed [[Participatory democracy|neighbourhood assemblies]], occupied unused land and factories, created [[barter]] and [[Mutual aid (organization theory)|mutual aid]] networks, implemented workers' self-management across hundreds of factories and rejected trade unionism and political parties.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Que Se Vayan Todos: Argentina's Popular Rebellion|last=Whitney|first=Jennifer|publisher=Kersplebedeb|year=2003|isbn=|location=Montreal|pages=56}}</ref> Around a third of the population participated in these creations and these efforts have been repeatedly praised by [[Anarchism|anarchists]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Anarchy Works|last=Gelderloos|first=Peter|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[1989 riots in Argentina]]\n* [[List of cases of police brutality in Argentina]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Sources and further reading ==\n* {{cite book \n|last= Reato\n|first= Ceferino\n|date= 2015\n|title= Doce noches\n|trans-title= Twelve nights\n|language= Spanish\n|location= Argentina\n|publisher= Sudamericana\n|isbn= 978-950-07-5203-9}}\n* {{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/americas/12/19/argentina.riots/ |title=Argentina in state of siege after deadly riots |publisher=CNN.com |date=20 December 2001}}\n* {{cite web |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/americas/12/20/argentina/index.html |title=Argentina teeters on possible economic collapse |publisher=CNN.com |date=21 December 2001 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024022128/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/americas/12/20/argentina/index.html |archivedate=24 October 2007 }}\n* {{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1721103.stm |title=The events that triggered Argentina's crisis |publisher=BBC News - Business |date=21 December 2001}}\n* {{cite journal|url=http://www.sunysb.edu/sociol/faculty/Auyero/Food%20Riots%203.pdf |title=The Dynamics of Collective Violence: Dissecting Food Riots in Contemporary Argentina |author=Javier Auyero, Timothy Patrick Moran |publisher=Department of Sociology, State University of New York \u2013 Stony Brook |format=PDF |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070615180050/http://www.sunysb.edu/sociol/faculty/Auyero/Food%20Riots%203.pdf |archivedate=15 June 2007 }}\n* {{cite journal |url=http://www.wdm.org.uk/campaigns/cambriefs/debt/stateunrest3/unrest3i.htm |author=Mark Ellis-Jones |title=States of unrest III: Resistance to IMF and World Bank policies in poor countries: Argentina |publisher=World Development Movement |date=April 2003 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051109185014/http://www.wdm.org.uk/campaigns/cambriefs/debt/stateunrest3/unrest3i.htm |archivedate=9 November 2005 }}\n\n{{Argentina topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:December 2001 Riots In Argentina}}\n[[Category:Emergency laws]]\n[[Category:Protest marches]]\n[[Category:Economic history of Argentina]]\n[[Category:Protests in Argentina]]\n[[Category:Riots and civil disorder in Argentina]]\n[[Category:Police misconduct in Argentina]]\n[[Category:2001 riots]]\n[[Category:2001 in Argentina]]\n[[Category:Presidency of Fernando de la R\u00faa]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:2001 protests]]\n[[Category:December 2001 events in South America]]\n", "name_user": "Charicaric", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_2001_riots_in_Argentina"}

Population estimates cannot be considered accurate to more than two decimal digits;\nfor example, world population for the year 2012 was estimated at\n7.02,  7.06 and 7.08 billion by the  [[United States Census Bureau]], the [[Population Reference Bureau]]  and the [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]], respectively, corresponding to \na spread of estimates of the order of 0.8%.\n\n==Deep prehistory==\n{{further|Paleodemography}}\n[[File:Population curve.svg|thumb|350px|Graph of world population over the past 12,000 years ([[Holocene]]).]]\nAs a general rule, the confidence of estimates on historical world population decreases for the more distant past. \nRobust population data exists only for the last two or three centuries. Until the late 18th century, few governments had ever performed an accurate census. In many early attempts, such as in [[Census in Egypt|Ancient Egypt]] and the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], the focus was on counting merely a subset of the population for purposes of taxation or military service.<ref>Kurt, A.

London: Routledge. p. 695.</ref>  \nPublished estimates for the 1st century (\"[[AD 1]]\") suggest an uncertainty of the order of 50% (estimates range between 150 and 330 million).\nSome estimates extend their timeline into deep prehistory, to \"[[10,000 BC]]\", i.e. the  [[Holocene|early Holocene]],  when world population estimates range roughly between one and ten million (with an uncertainty of up to an order of magnitude).<ref>Thomlinson (1975): \"one to ten million\".</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 22560092 | doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2012.04.003 | pmc=3376494 | volume=90 | issue=5 | title=Mitochondrial DNA signals of late glacial recolonization of Europe from near eastern refugia | year=2012 | journal=Am.

At this time human populations consisted entirely of non-sedentary [[hunter-gatherer]] populations, with [[anatomically modern humans]] existing alongside [[Archaic humans|archaic human varieties]], some of which are still ancestral to the modern human population due to  [[archaic human admixture with modern humans|interbreeding with modern humans]] during the [[Upper Paleolithic]]. \nEstimates of the size of these populations are a topic of [[paleoanthropology]]. A late human [[population bottleneck]] is postulated by some scholars at approximately 70,000 years ago, during the [[Toba catastrophe theory|Toba catastrophe]], when ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' population may have dropped to as low as between 1,000 and 10,000 individuals.<ref name=ambrose1998>{{cite journal\n | author=Stanley H.

Our findings are consistent with this hypothesis, but, depending on the mutation rate, we find either an effective population size of NA = 12,000 (95% C.I. = 9,000\u201315,500 when averaging over all three demographic models) using the mutation rate calibrated with the human-chimp divergence or an effective population size of NA = 32,500 individuals (95% C.I. = 27,500\u201334,500) using the mutation rate given by whole-genome trio analysis (The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium 2010) (supplementary figure 4 and table 6, Supplementary Material online).

Relating the estimated effective population size to the census population size during the Pleistocene is a difficult task because there are many factors affecting the effective population size (Charlesworth 2009). Nevertheless, based on published estimates of the ratio between effective and census population size, a comprehensive value on the order of 10% has been found by Frankham (1995).

An estimate on the \"total number of people who have ever lived\" as of 1995 was calculated by Haub (1995) at \"about 105 billion births since the dawn of the human race\" with a cut-off date at 50,000 BC (beginning of the Upper Paleolithic), and an inclusion of a high infant mortality rate throughout pre-modern history.<ref>Haub (1995): \"Life expectancy at birth probably averaged only about 10 years for most of human history.  Estimates of average life expectancy in Iron Age France have been put at only 10 or 12 years. Under these conditions, the birth rate would have to be about 80 per 1,000 people just for the species to survive. ... Our birth rate assumption will greatly affect the estimate of the number of persons ever born. Infant mortality in the human  race's earliest days is thought to have been very high\u2014perhaps 500 infant deaths per 1,000 births, or even higher. ...\nBirth rates were set at 80 per 1,000 per year through 1 A.D. and at 60 per 1,000 from 2 A.D. to 1750.

fraught with great uncertainties, and few of the published estimates have [[confidence interval]]s; in the absence of a straightforward means to assess the error of such estimates, a rough idea of expert consensus can be gained by comparing the values given in independent publications. Population estimates cannot be considered accurate to more than two decimal digits;\nfor example, world population for the year 2012 was estimated at\n7.02,  7.06 and 7.08 billion by the  [[United States Census Bureau]], the [[Population Reference Bureau]]  and the [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]], respectively, corresponding to \na spread of estimates of the order of 0.8%.\n\n==Deep prehistory==\n{{further|Paleodemography}}\n[[File:Population curve.svg|thumb|350px|Graph of world population over the past 12,000 years ([[Holocene]]).]]\nAs a general rule, the confidence of estimates on historical world population decreases for the more distant past. \nRobust population data exists only for the last two or three centuries. Until the late 18th century, few governments had ever performed an accurate census. In many early attempts, such as in [[Census in Egypt|Ancient Egypt]] and the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], the focus was on counting merely a subset of the population for purposes of taxation or military service.<ref>Kurt, A.

At this time human populations consisted entirely of non-sedentary [[hunter-gatherer]] populations, with [[anatomically modern humans]] existing alongside [[Archaic humans|archaic human varieties]], some of which are still ancestral to the modern human population due to  [[archaic human admixture with modern humans|interbreeding with modern humans]] during the [[Upper Paleolithic]]. \nEstimates of the size of these populations are a topic of [[paleoanthropology]]. A late human [[population bottleneck]] is postulated by some scholars at approximately 70,000 years ago, during the [[Toba catastrophe theory|Toba catastrophe]], when ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' population may have dropped to as low as between 1,000 and 10,000 individuals.<ref name=ambrose1998>{{cite journal\n | author=Stanley H.

Our findings are consistent with this hypothesis, but, depending on the mutation rate, we find either an effective population size of NA = 12,000 (95% C.I. = 9,000\u201315,500 when averaging over all three demographic models) using the mutation rate calibrated with the human-chimp divergence or an effective population size of NA = 32,500 individuals (95% C.I. = 27,500\u201334,500) using the mutation rate given by whole-genome trio analysis (The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium 2010) (supplementary figure 4 and table 6, Supplementary Material online).

Relating the estimated effective population size to the census population size during the Pleistocene is a difficult task because there are many factors affecting the effective population size (Charlesworth 2009). Nevertheless, based on published estimates of the ratio between effective and census population size, a comprehensive value on the order of 10% has been found by Frankham (1995).

An estimate on the \"total number of people who have ever lived\" as of 1995 was calculated by Haub (1995) at \"about 105 billion births since the dawn of the human race\" with a cut-off date at 50,000 BC (beginning of the Upper Paleolithic), and an inclusion of a high infant mortality rate throughout pre-modern history.<ref>Haub (1995): \"Life expectancy at birth probably averaged only about 10 years for most of human history.  Estimates of average life expectancy in Iron Age France have been put at only 10 or 12 years. Under these conditions, the birth rate would have to be about 80 per 1,000 people just for the species to survive. ... Our birth rate assumption will greatly affect the estimate of the number of persons ever born. Infant mortality in the human  race's earliest days is thought to have been very high\u2014perhaps 500 infant deaths per 1,000 births, or even higher. ...\nBirth rates were set at 80 per 1,000 per year through 1 A.D. and at 60 per 1,000 from 2 A.D. to 1750.

In 1888 Tigers fixture list started to expand outside the midlands, on 10 March they traveled to [[Valley Parade]] in Bradford to play [[Manningham F.C.]], the forerunners of soccer side [[Bradford City]].  The 1888\u201389 season saw Tigers welcome back Manningham as well as [[Oldham R.L.F.C.|Oldham]] and [[Swinton Lions|Swinton]], [[Cardiff Harlequins RFC|Cardiff Harlequins]] became the club's first [[Wales|Welsh]] opponents.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Farmer|first1=Stuart|last2=Hands|first2=David|title=Tigers - Official history of Leicester Football Club|publisher=The Rugby DevelopmentFoundation|isbn=978-0-9930213-0-5|page=20}}</ref>  Leicester also reached their first Midland Counties Cup Final that year losing, again, to Moseley in front of 4,000 fans in Coventry.\n\n1889-90 saw Tigers travel to [[Wales]] for the first time playing [[Cardiff RFC|Cardiff]] and [[Newport RFC|Newport]] on consecutive days, the Monday and Tuesday of Easter week.

In the final [[Nuneaton R.F.C.|Nuneaton]] were beaten 20\u20133.  For the next three seasons Leicester had the better of Moseley beating them in the final each year, before seeing off Rugby in the final of 1903.

The inquiry was not only into professionalism but also the transfers of Jackson & Jackett as well as [[Alf Kewney]] and [[Thomas Hogarth (rugby union)|Tom Hogarth]].  On 30 January 1909, the day Leicester hosted an [[England national rugby union team|England]] v [[France national rugby union team|France]] test match, the [[Rugby Football Union|RFU]] announced the outcome of the inquiry clearing the club on all charges in what has been described as a [[Whitewashing (censorship)|whitewash]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Farmer|first1=Stuart|last2=Hands|first2=David|title=Tigers - Official history of Leicester Football Club|publisher=The Rugby DevelopmentFoundation|isbn=978-0-9930213-0-5|page=60}}</ref>\n\nAs if to refute the notion that the Tigers were made up purely of imported players there were 12 locals selected for the 1909 Midland Counties Cup Final against [[Coventry R.F.C.|Coventry]].

The roof of the Crumbie Stand had been damaged in air raids, there was a collapsed wall at the Welford Road end and significant repairs to the clubhouse were required where the Army had bored holes into the floor.

The practice of being an \"invitation\" club featuring only a First XV was to stop and Tigers were to adopt a more traditional membership club based approach with multiple sides.  The \"A XV\" was to be re-introduced under the name \"Extra First XV\" with a third \"Colts XV\" also formed.  With only one side, the club had been suffering losing players because of a lack of regular rugby for those on the fringes of the starting side.

Tigers scored 122 tries and 657 points that season. Moves towards a return to competitive rugby were made with discussion held on leagues or a knock out cup. Tigers president Nick Hughes favoured regional pools before a national knock out tournament.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Farmer|first1=Stuart|last2=Hands|first2=David|title=Tigers - Official history of Leicester Football Club|publisher=The Rugby DevelopmentFoundation|isbn=978-0-9930213-0-5|page=168}}</ref>\n\nDespite usually returning more wins than losses Leicester's standing at the time was not what it is now.

The [[Rugby Football Union|RFU]] introduced for the first time a national [[1971-72 John Player Cup|Knockout Cup]] competition for clubs and on 16 November 1971 Tigers played their first competitive cup match since 1914, a 10\u20133 defeat to [[Nottingham R.F.C.|Nottingham]] at their Beeston ground.\n\nAlso introduced that season was Tigers' first \"Youth\" XV, based on the Leicester Ravens a collection of the best 14 and 15 year olds in the county.  Their first game was on 15 April 1972 and they made an immediate impact, captain of that side was Steve Kenney who would score the winning try in the [[1978-79 John Player Cup|1979 Cup Final]].

There was still no joy in the Cup with a first round defeat to [[Northampton Saints|Northampton]] also meaning Tigers failed to qualify the next season.

This forced the club into the Midlands qualifiers for the only time.  They beat [[Nottingham R.F.C.|Nottingham]], local junior club [[Leicester Lions RFC|Westleigh]] and [[Kettering Rugby Football Club|Kettering]] to qualify for the [[1976-77 John Player Cup|1976-77 Cup]] where a win against [[Wakefield RFC|Wakefield]] lead to a second round defeat against [[Moseley Rugby Football Club|Moseley]].\n\nThis era saw a huge increase in the popularity of the [[Barbarian F.C.|Barbarians]] annual fixture which crowds of 15,000 in 1973 & 1975, 17,000 in 1974 and 21,000 in 1976.

The game ended in a 6\u20133 loss to the Cherry and Whites; the attendance was 25,282 more than double the previous season.

The main difference from the merit table was all sides would now have to play all other sides in a round robin, though a fixtures dispute meant the Tigers v Gloucester match was not played.  Tigers hit the top of the league on 28 November following a 21\u20133 win away at [[Moseley R.F.C.|Moseley]] and stayed there losing only one match all season.  When they beat [[Waterloo R.F.C.|Waterloo]] in front of 7,130 supporters on the last day of the [[1987\u201388 Courage League|1987-88 season]], Easter Monday 4 April, the Tigers became England's first official champions.\n\nTigers finished the season on 37 points, one ahead of nearest rivals [[Wasps RFC|Wasps]].\n\n===New generation emerges as progress falters (1988-92)===\n\nThe [[1988-89 Courage League]] saw Tigers slump to 6th in the league, their joint worst ever finish, but more joy was to be had in the [[1988-89 Pilkington Cup|Cup]] as Tigers beat Liverpool St Helens (37-6), Rosslyn Park (23-9), Wasps (22-18) and Quins (16-7) to set up a final with Bath.  In what was [[Dusty Hare]]'s 394th and last game for the club Tigers lead 6\u20130 at half time but lost 10\u20136 with [[Stuart Barnes]] scoring Bath's winning try in the 78th minute.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Farmer|first1=Stuart|last2=Hands|first2=David|title=Tigers - Official history of Leicester Football Club|publisher=The Rugby DevelopmentFoundation|isbn=978-0-9930213-0-5|page=226}}</ref>\n\n[[Martin Johnson (rugby union)|Martin Johnson]] made his debut for the First XV in February 1989 whilst [[Les Cusworth]] retired at the end of the 1989/90 season.  In August 1990 Leicester appointed their first paid official: Tony Russ, who had led [[Saracen F.C.|Saracens]] to promotion then 4th place in the league before accepting the role of \"Director of Coaching\" at Leicester.\n\n[[Neil Back]] joined that summer and made his debut at home against [[Bedford Blues|Bedford]], whilst [[Graham Rowntree]] was promoted from the club's youth ranks and made his debut in October against [[Oxford University]].  The changing of the guard from Cup winning team of the early 80s was complete when [[Paul Dodge]] retired at the end of the 1990/91 season.\n\nThe early 1990s saw the emergence of Leicester's renowned ABC Club, so called because of the letters the front row players wore on their shirts; [[Graham Rowntree]] played loosehead and wore \"A\", hooker [[Richard Cockerill]] wore \"B\" and [[Darren Garforth]] played tighthead prop and wore \"C\".  The trio started 166 games together between 1992 and 2002, Garforth and Rowntree started another 72 games together at prop, but with different hookers.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Farmer|first1=Stuart|last2=Hands|first2=David|title=Tigers - Official history of Leicester Football Club|publisher=The Rugby DevelopmentFoundation|isbn=978-0-9930213-0-5|page=492}}</ref>\n\n===Mid Nineties success and near misses (1993-98)===\n\nFrom 1993 Leicester enjoyed a remarkable nine trophies in 10 years. This streak started when a young pack featuring Rowntree, Cockerill, Garforth, [[Matt Poole|Poole]], [[Martin Johnson (rugby union)|Johnson]] and [[Neil Back|Back]] defeated [[London Scottish F.C.|London Scottish]], [[Nottingham Rugby|Nottingham]], [[Exeter Chiefs|Exeter]] and [[Northampton Saints|Northampton]] to set up a [[Twickenham Stadium|Twickenham]] date with [[Harlequin F.C.|Harlequins]] who they defeated 23\u201316 in the [[1992-93 Pilkington Cup|1993 cup final]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Farmer|first1=Stuart|last2=Hands|first2=David|title=Tigers - Official history of Leicester Football Club|publisher=The Rugby DevelopmentFoundation|isbn=978-0-9930213-0-5|page=241}}</ref> In 1993/94 season Tigers made the [[1993-94 Pilkington Cup|cup final]] but this time Leicester fell short to rivals [[Bath Rugby|Bath]], losing 21\u20139. Leicester were also runners up in the [[1993-94 English Premiership (rugby union)|league]] to Bath.\n\nLeicester were [[1994-95 English Premiership (rugby union)|English champions again in 1995]], that season the league was played in two main blocks with sporadic fixtures in between; the first 9 games were played on consecutive weekends from 10 September 1994 to 5 November 1994, two games were played in January 1995, one in February 1995 and one at the beginning of March 1995 before finishing with 5 games in 6 weeks from 25 March to 29 April. In the first period Tigers won 7, drew against Bath away, and lost to Bristol to leave them 2nd in the table. Against [[Orrell R.U.F.C.|Orrell]] on 14 January 1995 [[Martin Johnson (rugby union)|Martin Johnson]] captained Leicester for the first time, regular captain [[Dean Richards (rugby union)|Dean Richards]] and vice captain [[John Wells (rugby union)|John Wells]] being unavailable. Tigers won 29\u201319.\n\nPreparations for the [[1995 Rugby World Cup]] which started in May were deemed all important so England players Johnson and [[Rory Underwood]], missed Leicester's February league match against [[Gloucester Rugby|Gloucester]] where Leicester slipped to a second defeat. Leicester returned to the top after a win against [[West Hartlepool R.F.C.|West Hartlepool]] and had crucial wins against [[Bath Rugby|Bath]] and [[Sale Sharks|Sale]].

Leicester's [[Heineken Cup]] debut was against [[Leinster Rugby|Leinster]] at [[Donnybrook Stadium|Donnybrook]]. Leicester beat [[Leinster Rugby|Leinster]], [[Border Reivers (rugby)|Scottish Borders]], [[Section Paloise|Pau]] and [[Llanelli RFC|Llanelli]] in the group stage before beating Harlequins (quarter finals) and [[Stade Toulousain|Toulouse]] (semi finals) to set up [[1997 Heineken Cup Final|the final]] against [[CA Brive|Brive]]. The match was close at half time, Leicester were behind 8-6 but the French side ran riot in the second half to win 28\u20139.  Tigers faltered in the league but did secure silverware beating [[Sale Sharks|Sale]] 9\u20133 in the [[1996-97 Pilkington Cup|1997 Pilkington Cup Final]].  That summer [[Martin Johnson (rugby union)|Martin Johnson]] was named as captain of the [[1997 British Lions tour to South Africa]]; [[Eric Miller (rugby union)|Eric Miller]], [[Graham Rowntree]], [[Neil Back]], [[Austin Healey]] and [[Will Greenwood]] were also named as tourists.\n\nThe 1997/98 season started with the [[1997-98 Heineken Cup|Heineken Cup]] and Leicester secured a quarter final play off after finishing second in their group containing [[Leinster Rugby|Leinster]], [[Stade Toulousain|Toulouse]] and Amatori Milan. Tigers beat the Italian side twice but lost away to Leinster and at home to Toulouse. In the quarter final play off Leicester beat [[Glasgow Warriors|Glasgow]] 90-19 but lost in the quarter final proper away to [[Section Paloise|Pau]]. Domestically Tigers were a mixed bag, winning 12, losing 8 and drawing 2 games to finish 4th in the [[1997-98 English Premiership (rugby union)|Allied Dunbar Premiership]]. In February 1998 [[Dean Richards (rugby union)|Dean Richards]] was appointed as Director of Rugby following [[Bob Dwyer]]'s sacking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12308959.Leicester_sack_Dwyer_as_Richards_takes_over/|title=Leicester sack Dwyer as Richards takes over|publisher=The Herald, Scotland|date=18 February 1998|accessdate=24 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rugby-union-deano-moves-in-as-tigers-sack-dwyer-1145544.html|title=Rugby Union: Deano moves in as Tigers sack Dwyer|publisher=The Independent|date=18 February 1998|accessdate=24 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Six Titles in Four Years, Deano's golden years (1998-2003)===\n\nFollowing a dispute between the English clubs and European Cup organisers there was no English involvement in the [[1998-99 Heineken Cup]]; this led to an expanded [[1998-99 English Premiership (rugby union)|Premiership]] of 14 clubs and 28 games. Tigers started the new season well with a 49\u201315 win against [[Harlequin F.C.|Harlequins]] and wins against [[London Scottish F.C.|London Scottish]], [[Northampton Saints|Northampton]] and [[Bedford Blues|Bedford]] to see Tigers top the table at the end of September. Losses against [[Saracen F.C.|Saracens]] and [[London Irish]] in rounds 5 & 7 saw Tigers slip to 3rd in October; Leicester regained the lead in the table after victories against [[Richmond F.C.|Richmond]] and [[West Hartlepool RFC|West Hartlepool]] and were never to lose it despite a loss to Wasps two weeks later. Dreams of the double were dashed by Richmond in the quarter finals of the cup, Johnson received a white card (at the time signifying 10 minutes in the sin bin) and during his absence the Londoners scored their two tries in a 15\u201313 win. The next week Johnson was sin binned again, this time in a league match against closest challengers Northampton, but even with [[Pat Howard]] also sin binned and Leicester down to 13 men for a period so outstanding was Johnson's play they won 22\u201315.

Tigers started the season poorly, losing two of the first three games.  Even with three other wins Leicester finished the World Cup period in 8th position in the league. English clubs returned to European competition but in the [[1999-2000 Heineken Cup pool stage|1999-2000 Heineken Cup]] Leicester lost four pool games to exit at the first stage.\n\nHowever they were to only lose one further Premiership game, away to [[Saracen F.C.|Saracens]] in December. Tigers retained their title on 14 May 2000 with a 30\u201323 win against [[Bristol Rugby|Bristol]] at the [[Memorial Stadium (Bristol)|Memorial Ground]].  The trophy was presented the next week at [[Welford Road Stadium|Welford Road]] following their 13th consecutive league win, a 43\u201325 win against Premiership runners-up Bath.\n\nHaving dominated domestic rugby for the previous two years Leicester were desperate to avenge their [[1997 Heineken Cup Final]] defeat and claim their first European title. Local rivals [[Northampton Saints]] had claimed the [[1999-2000 Heineken Cup|previous season's title]] with perennial rivals Bath claiming the title in 1998. Tigers were drawn with [[Section Paloise|Pau]], [[Glasgow Warriors|Glasgow]] and [[Pontypridd RFC|Pontypridd]] in their [[2000-01 Heineken Cup pool stage|Heineken Cup pool]].  Wins at home to Pau and away to Glasgow preceded a loss in Wales to Pontypridd that was quickly avenged a week later at [[Welford Road Stadium|Welford Road]].  Two wins in the final two pool games led to a January quarter final against [[Swansea RFC|Swansea]] which Leicester won 41\u201310.\n\nDomestically Leicester were again top of the table and at this stage 11 points clear of [[Northampton Saints|Northampton]] in second place. The gap was pushed to 18 points on 10 March 2001 when Tigers beat Northampton at [[Franklin's Gardens]] and Tigers' third successive [[English Premiership (rugby union)|English league title]] was formally sealed on 17 March 2001 against [[Newcastle Falcons|Newcastle]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Farmer|first1=Stuart|last2=Hands|first2=David|title=Tigers - Official history of Leicester Football Club|publisher=The Rugby DevelopmentFoundation|isbn=978-0-9930213-0-5|page=268}}</ref>\n\nWith the domestic title sealed, Leicester went into the [[2000-01 Heineken Cup|Heineken Cup]] semi finals against [[Gloucester Rugby|Gloucester]]. [[Leon Lloyd]]'s try gave Leicester a 19\u201315 win, despite [[Martin Johnson (rugby union)|Martin Johnson]] spending time in the sin bin, to set up the final in the [[Parc des Princes]] against [[Stade Francais]]. In [[2001 Heineken Cup Final|the final]] Johnson was again sin binned but thanks to tries from [[Neil Back]] and two from Leon Lloyd Tigers prevailed winning 34\u201330 to secure the club's first continental title.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/club/3005773/Leicester-rule-in-bear-pit.html|title=Leicester rule in bear pit|date=19 May 2001|accessdate=3 February 2017}}</ref> Tigers had won the inaugural Premiership play offs the week before so also sealed an unprecedented treble.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/in_depth/2000/heineken_cup/1339721.stm|title=European glory seals Leicester treble|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=19 May 2001 |accessdate=7 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nThat summer [[Martin Johnson (rugby union)|Martin Johnson]] was named captain for the [[2001 British and Irish Lions tour to Australia]], becoming the first man to lead two tours; [[Austin Healey]] and [[Neil Back]] were also named in the original touring squad whilst [[Dorian West]] and [[Martin Corry (rugby union)|Martin Corry]] were to join the tour as injury replacements.\n\nLeicester became the first side to retain a European title after beating [[Munster Rugby|Munster]] in 2002.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/european/2008245.stm|title=Tigers retain European Cup|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=25 May 2002 |accessdate=7 September 2014}}</ref> Leicester also retained their Premiership title. They opened the season with a loss away to Newcastle, having rested their summer Lions, but try bonus point wins in their next three games quickly saw Leicester return to the top of the table. The [[2001-02 Heineken Cup pool stage|Heineken Cup pool]] stages started with wins against [[Llanelli RFC|Llanelli]] and Calvisano. Back to back wins against [[USA Perpignan]] in October and November saw Leicester through as group winners but a loss to Llanelli in the final round allowed the Welsh side through to the knock out stages as a best runner up.  In the quarter final Leicester faced [[Leinster Rugby|Leinster]] at [[Welford Road Stadium|Welford Road]] winning 29\u201318.\n\nAfter only two defeats in 17 Premiership matches Leicester had the chance to seal the title against [[Wasps RFC|London Wasps]] but in a remarkable game lost 24\u201336, Wasps scores came from ten penalties and two drop goals.  Leicester secure their fourth successive title against [[Newcastle Falcons|Newcastle]] on 13 April 2002 at Welford Road. This brought the club's total to six championship, tying Bath's record.\n\nTwo weeks later Johnson captained Leicester as they traveled to Nottingham's [[City Ground]] for the Heineken Cup semi final against Llanelli.

The roof of the Crumbie Stand had been damaged in air raids, there was a collapsed wall at the Welford Road end and significant repairs to the clubhouse were required where the Army had bored holes into the floor.

The practice of being an \"invitation\" club featuring only a First XV was to stop and Tigers were to adopt a more traditional membership club based approach with multiple sides.  The \"A XV\" was to be re-introduced under the name \"Extra First XV\" with a third \"Colts XV\" also formed.  With only one side, the club had been suffering losing players because of a lack of regular rugby for those on the fringes of the starting side.

Tigers scored 122 tries and 657 points that season. Moves towards a return to competitive rugby were made with discussion held on leagues or a knock out cup.

The main difference from the merit table was all sides would now have to play all other sides in a round robin, though a fixtures dispute meant the Tigers v Gloucester match was not played.  Tigers hit the top of the league on 28 November following a 21-3 win away at [[Moseley R.F.C.|Moseley]] and stayed there losing only one match all season.  When they beat [[Waterloo R.F.C.|Waterloo]] in front of 7,130 supporters on the last day of the [[1987\u201388 Courage League|1987-88 season]], Easter Monday 4 April, the Tigers became England's first official champions.\n\nTigers finished the season on 37 points, one ahead of nearest rivals [[Wasps RFC|Wasps]].\n\n===New generation emerges as progress falters (1988-92)===\n\nThe [[1988-89 Courage League]] saw Tigers slump to 6th in the league, their joint worst ever finish, but more joy was to be had in the [[1988-89 Pilkington Cup|Cup]] as Tigers beat Liverpool St Helens (37-6), Rosslyn Park (23-9), Wasps (22-18) and Quins (16-7) to set up a final with Bath.

Leicester were also runners up in the [[1993-94 English Premiership (rugby union)|league]] to Bath.\n\nLeicester were [[1994-95 English Premiership (rugby union)|English champions again in 1995]], that season the league was played in two main blocks with sporadic fixtures in between; the first 9 games were played on consecutive weekends from 10 September 1994 to 5 November 1994, two games were played in January 1995, one in February 1995 and one at the beginning of March 1995 before finishing with 5 games in 6 weeks from 25 March to 29 April. In the first period Tigers won 7, drew against Bath away, and lost to Bristol to leave them 2nd in the table. Against [[Orrell R.U.F.C.|Orrell]] on 14 January 1995 [[Martin Johnson (rugby union)|Martin Johnson]] captained Leicester for the first time, regular captain [[Dean Richards (rugby union)|Dean Richards]] and vice captain [[John Wells (rugby union)|John Wells]] being unavailable. Tigers won 29-19.\n\nPreparations for the [[1995 Rugby World Cup]] which started in May were deemed all important so England players Johnson and [[Rory Underwood]], missed Leicester's February league match against [[Gloucester Rugby|Gloucester]] where Leicester slipped to a second defeat. Leicester returned to the top after a win against [[West Hartlepool R.F.C.|West Hartlepool]] and had crucial wins against [[Bath Rugby|Bath]] and [[Sale Sharks|Sale]].

Leicester's [[Heineken Cup]] debut was against [[Leinster Rugby|Leinster]] at [[Donnybrook Stadium|Donnybrook]]. Leicester beat [[Leinster Rugby|Leinster]], [[Border Reivers (rugby)|Scottish Borders]], [[Section Paloise|Pau]] and [[Llanelli RFC|Llanelli]] in the group stage before beating Harlequins (quarter finals) and [[Stade Toulousain|Toulouse]] (semi finals) to set up [[1997 Heineken Cup Final|the final]] against [[CA Brive|Brive]]. The match was close at half time, Leicester were behind 8-6 but the French side ran riot in the second half to win 28-9.  Tigers faltered in the league but did secure silverware beating [[Sale Sharks|Sale]] 9-3 in the [[1996-97 Pilkington Cup|1997 Pilkington Cup Final]].  That summer [[Martin Johnson (rugby union)|Martin Johnson]] was named as captain of the [[1997 British Lions tour to South Africa]]; [[Eric Miller (rugby union)|Eric Miller]], [[Graham Rowntree]], [[Neil Back]], [[Austin Healey]] and [[Will Greenwood]] were also named as tourists.\n\nThe 1997/98 season started with the [[1997-98 Heineken Cup|Heineken Cup]] and Leicester secured a quarter final play off after finishing second in their group containing [[Leinster Rugby|Leinster]], [[Stade Toulousain|Toulouse]] and Amatori Milan. Tigers beat the Italian side twice but lost away to Leinster and at home to Toulouse. In the quarter final play off Leicester beat [[Glasgow Warriors|Glasgow]] 90-19 but lost in the quarter final proper away to [[Section Paloise|Pau]]. Domestically Tigers were a mixed bag, winning 12, losing 8 and drawing 2 games to finish 4th in the [[1997-98 English Premiership (rugby union)|Allied Dunbar Premiership]]. In February 1998 [[Dean Richards (rugby union)|Dean Richards]] was appointed as Director of Rugby following [[Bob Dwyer]]'s sacking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12308959.Leicester_sack_Dwyer_as_Richards_takes_over/|title=Leicester sack Dwyer as Richards takes over|publisher=The Herald, Scotland|date=18 February 1998|accessdate=24 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rugby-union-deano-moves-in-as-tigers-sack-dwyer-1145544.html|title=Rugby Union: Deano moves in as Tigers sack Dwyer|publisher=The Independent|date=18 February 1998|accessdate=24 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Six Titles in Four Years, Deano's golden years (1998-2003)===\n\nFollowing a dispute between the English clubs and European Cup organisers there was no English involvement in the [[1998-99 Heineken Cup]]; this led to an expanded [[1998-99 English Premiership (rugby union)|Premiership]] of 14 clubs and 28 games. Tigers started the new season well with a 49-15 win against [[Harlequin F.C.|Harlequins]] and wins against [[London Scottish F.C.|London Scottish]], [[Northampton Saints|Northampton]] and [[Bedford Blues|Bedford]] to see Tigers top the table at the end of September. Losses against [[Saracen F.C.|Saracens]] and [[London Irish]] in rounds 5 & 7 saw Tigers slip to 3rd in October; Leicester regained the lead in the table after victories against [[Richmond F.C.|Richmond]] and [[West Hartlepool RFC|West Hartlepool]] and were never to lose it despite a loss to Wasps two weeks later. Dreams of the double were dashed by Richmond in the quarter finals of the cup, Johnson received a white card (at the time signifying 10 minutes in the sin bin) and during his absence the Londoners scored their two tries in a 15-13 win. The next week Johnson was sin binned again, this time in a league match against closest challengers Northampton, but even with [[Pat Howard]] also sin binned and Leicester down to 13 men for a period so outstanding was Johnson's play they won 22-15.

Tigers started the season poorly, losing two of the first three games.  Even with three other wins Leicester finished the World Cup period in 8th position in the league. English clubs returned to European competition but in the [[1999-2000 Heineken Cup pool stage|1999-2000 Heineken Cup]] Leicester lost four pool games to exit at the first stage.\n\nHowever they were to only lose one further Premiership game, away to [[Saracen F.C.|Saracens]] in December. Tigers retained their title on 14 May 2000 with a 30-23 win against [[Bristol Rugby|Bristol]] at the [[Memorial Stadium (Bristol)|Memorial Ground]].  The trophy was presented the next week at [[Welford Road Stadium|Welford Road]] following their 13th consecutive league win, a 43-25 win against Premiership runners-up Bath.\n\nHaving dominated domestic rugby for the previous two years Leicester were desperate to avenge their [[1997 Heineken Cup Final]] defeat and claim their first European title. Local rivals [[Northampton Saints]] had claimed the [[1999-2000 Heineken Cup|previous season's title]] with perennial rivals Bath claiming the title in 1998. Tigers were drawn with [[Section Paloise|Pau]], [[Glasgow Warriors|Glasgow]] and [[Pontypridd RFC|Pontypridd]] in their [[2000-01 Heineken Cup pool stage|Heineken Cup pool]].  Wins at home to Pau and away to Glasgow preceded a loss in Wales to Pontypridd that was quickly avenged a week later at [[Welford Road Stadium|Welford Road]].  Two wins in the final two pool games led to a January quarter final against [[Swansea RFC|Swansea]] which Leicester won 41-10.\n\nDomestically Leicester were again top of the table and at this stage 11 points clear of [[Northampton Saints|Northampton]] in second place. The gap was pushed to 18 points on 10 March 2001 when Tigers beat Northampton at [[Franklin's Gardens]] and Tigers' third successive [[English Premiership (rugby union)|English league title]] was formally sealed on 17 March 2001 against [[Newcastle Falcons|Newcastle]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Farmer|first1=Stuart|last2=Hands|first2=David|title=Tigers - Official history of Leicester Football Club|publisher=The Rugby DevelopmentFoundation|isbn=978-0-9930213-0-5|page=268}}</ref>\n\nWith the domestic title sealed, Leicester went into the [[2000-01 Heineken Cup|Heineken Cup]] semi finals against [[Gloucester Rugby|Gloucester]].

They opened the season with a loss away to Newcastle, having rested their summer Lions, but try bonus point wins in their next three games quickly saw Leicester return to the top of the table. The [[2001-02 Heineken Cup pool stage|Heineken Cup pool]] stages started with wins against [[Llanelli RFC|Llanelli]] and Calvisano. Back to back wins against [[USA Perpignan]] in October and November saw Leicester through as group winners but a loss to Llanelli in the final round allowed the Welsh side through to the knock out stages as a best runner up.  In the quarter final Leicester faced [[Leinster Rugby|Leinster]] at [[Welford Road Stadium|Welford Road]] winning 29-18.\n\nAfter only two defeats in 17 Premiership matches Leicester had the chance to seal the title against [[Wasps RFC|London Wasps]] but in a remarkable game lost 24-36, Wasps scores came from ten penalties and two drop goals.  Leicester secure their fourth successive title against [[Newcastle Falcons|Newcastle]] on 13 April 2002 at Welford Road. This brought the club's total to six championship, tying Bath's record.\n\nTwo weeks later Johnson captained Leicester as they traveled to Nottingham's [[City Ground]] for the Heineken Cup semi final against Llanelli.

However Leicester failed to win an unprecedented treble, by losing the [[Heineken Cup]] Final at Twickenham on 20 May to [[Wasps RFC|Wasps]].\n\nIt was announced on 28 December 2006 that the head coach [[Pat Howard]] would leave the club at the end of the season, to return to his native Australia.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/leicester/content/articles/2006/12/28/pat_howard_leaving_feature.shtml Howard returns home] \u2013 BBC News, 28 December 2006</ref>  He was succeeded by the then-head coach of {{nrut|Argentina}}, [[Marcelo Loffreda]] after the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/my_club/leicester/6576815.stm Loffreda named as new Tigers boss] \u2013 BBC News, 25 April 2007</ref>  Loffreda guided Leicester through the group stages of the EDF cup to the semi final where they defeated [[Wasps RFC|Wasps]] in a knock-out game for the first time since the 1980s.  This set up a rematch of the previous years final against the Ospreys, which Leicester lost. After losing all away games in the Heineken Cup that season Leicester failed to progress to the quarter finals.  In the league Leicester struggled until a last minute last day try by [[Tom Varndell]] beat [[Harlequin F.C.|Harlequins]] to set up a rematch of the previous seasons Premiership Final against Gloucester. Once again Leicester were successful late on, this time utilising [[Andy Goode]]'s kicking to secure a last minute victory. In the final they had no such luck losing to perennial rivals Wasps. After this final; despite guiding Leicester to two Twickenham finals and only being in the job seven-months Loffreda was sacked.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/jun/07/premiership.leicestertigers|title=Leicester sack Loffreda and plan future with a director of coaching|publisher=The Guardian|date=7 June 2008|accessdate=29 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Cockerill takes the reins (2009-16)===\n\n[[File:Geordan Murphy.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Geordan Murphy, pictured in 2012, played 322 games for Leicester between 1997 and 2013.

It is located to the south of the city of [[Graz]], between the [[Mur (river)|Mur]] and [[Sulm (Austria)|Sulm]] rivers.\n\nThe town is the capital of the [[Leibnitz (district)|Leibnitz political district]], which covers about 727&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, within which more than 80,000 people live. Leibnitz acts as a cultural, educational, judicial and economic focus for the surrounding district.\n\n==History==\nAlthough the center of the current town is only about 3&nbsp;km away from the archaeological site of [[Flavia Solva]], Leibnitz cannot claim direct successorship to this Roman [[municipium]] founded in the 1st century, and finally destroyed in the early 5th century. When [[History of Bavaria|Bavarian]] settlers moved into the area during the 9th century, superseding and gradually absorbing the [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] population that had established itself during the previous half-millennium, all recollection of the Roman city had long since faded.\n\nThe first documented version of the name Leibnitz reads ''Lipnizza'' and can be found in a scroll issued by emperor [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto the Great]] dated 7 March 970. However, a different settlement \u2013 the ''civitas Zuib'' (or ''Sulb''; both names recall the Roman ''Solva'') \u2013 was actually closer to the site of the present town than the ''civitas Lipnizza'' which was located on the nearby Frauenberg hill, where human occupation had persisted since the Neolithic age. Later, when the civilian settlement moved back and down to the Mur valley while the dwelling on the hill remained a fortified place, the name was transformed to ''Libniz'' and ''Libenizze'' (12th century), ''Leibentz'' and ''Leybencz'' (13th and 14th century), and finally ''Leybnitz'' (14th and 15th century). \n\nDuring the 12th century the settlement and its surrounding area, including the [[Sulm (Austria)|Sulm]] valley to the west, became territories of the [[Archbishopric of Salzburg]] and remained so for more than 400 years. The relocation of the civilian settlement was initiated (or at least heavily supported) by Archbishop Konradin of Salzburg, probably by 1130. In March 1170, Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Barbarossa]] discussed matters associated with Salzburg's authority in Leibnitz, and an imperial document dated 14 June 1178 granted full jurisdiction to Salzburg.\n\nThe transition decades from the [[Middle Ages]] proved extremely turbulent and destructive to the area around Leibnitz, as it was to all the south-east parts of modern Austria. The fact that Leibnitz was not fortified certainly contributed to the decision of Archbishop Bernhard von Rorer in 1479 to hand the township over to the invading [[Hungary|Hungarians]]; their occupation collapsed in 1490 and Austria quickly reclaimed Leibnitz, severely punishing those leading citizens who had collaborated with the Hungarians.\n\nIn the 18th and early 19th century, when Leibnitz had about 1,000 occupants, the town burned to the ground twice, on 29 May 1709 and again on 8\u20139 September 1829. By 1883 the population had risen to 2,471 and on 27 April 1913 [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] emperor [[Franz Josef&nbsp;I of Austria]] formally elevated Leibnitz to city rank.\n\nBy 1 January 1968 the population of Leibnitz had reached 6,641 but its relative importance and vitality had severely declined since [[Lower Styria]] had fallen to [[Yugoslavia]] in 1919 as a consequence of [[World War&nbsp;I]], severing the city's vital connections to the south and effectively making it all but a \"dead-border township.\" From the 1970s onward, when it became easier for Yugoslav citizens to travel to Austria, Leibnitz started to experience a marked economic reinvigoration which gained momentum with the establishment of [[Slovenia]] as an independent state in 1991, and its entry into the [[European Union]] in 2004.\n\n==Local council==\nThe elections in 2015 showed the following results:\n* 16 seats [[SP\u00d6]]\n* 8 seats [[\u00d6VP]]\n* 4 seats [[FP\u00d6]]\n* 2 seats The Greens - The Green Alternative\n* 1 seat ''B\u00fcrgerforum Leibnitz''\n\n==Main sights==\n* The ruins of the Roman settlement of [[Flavia Solva]] near the village [[Wagna]]\n* [[Schloss Seggau]], a castle situated above the town on the Seggauberg. Founded in the 12th century by Archbishop Konrad&nbsp;I of [[Salzburg]], it now accommodates a conference center\n* The church on the Frauenberg on the hill (381 m) of the same name\n* Leibnitz Abbey\n\n==Culture and recreation==\nLeibnitz has a [[Movie theater|cinema]], an [[ice rink]] located in the center, and an open-air [[swimming pool]] with [[campsite]] and [[tennis]] courts. These facilities are enjoyed both by locals and passing tourist traffic on its way to the [[Adriatic]].\n\nInteresting annual events include a fall festival with harvest thanksgiving procession, Leibnitz \"wine week\" and a \"[[Paganism in the Eastern Alps#Perchten|Perchtenlauf]]\".\n\nThe [[vineyard]]-rich hilly countryside is home to many traditional wine-drinking establishments known as \"[[Heuriger|Buschenschenke]]\", where the local produce can be readily tasted.\n\nThe area is also crisscrossed by cycle trails, which are particularly popular in summer and fall.

It is located to the south of the city of [[Graz]], between the [[Mur (river)|Mur]] and [[Sulm (Austria)|Sulm]] rivers.\n\nThe town is the capital of the [[Leibnitz (district)|Leibnitz political district]], which covers about 727&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, within which more than 80,000 people live. Leibnitz acts as a cultural, educational, judicial and economic focus for the surrounding district.\n\n==History==\nAlthough the center of the current town is only about 3&nbsp;km away from the archaeological site of [[Flavia Solva]], Leibnitz cannot claim direct successorship to this Roman [[municipium]] founded in the 1st century, and finally destroyed in the early 5th century. When [[History of Bavaria|Bavarian]] settlers moved into the area during the 9th century, superseding and gradually absorbing the [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] population that had established itself during the previous half-millennium, all recollection of the Roman city had long since faded.\n\nThe first documented version of the name Leibnitz reads ''Lipnizza'' and can be found in a scroll issued by emperor [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto the Great]] dated 7 March 970. However, a different settlement \u2013 the ''civitas Zuib'' (or ''Sulb''; both names recall the Roman ''Solva'') \u2013 was actually closer to the site of the present town than the ''civitas Lipnizza'' which was located on the nearby Frauenberg hill, where human occupation had persisted since the Neolithic age. Later, when the civilian settlement moved back and down to the Mur valley while the dwelling on the hill remained a fortified place, the name was transformed to ''Libniz'' and ''Libenizze'' (12th century), ''Leibentz'' and ''Leybencz'' (13th and 14th century), and finally ''Leybnitz'' (14th and 15th century). \n\nDuring the 12th century the settlement and its surrounding area, including the [[Sulm (Austria)|Sulm]] valley to the west, became territories of the [[Archbishopric of Salzburg]] and remained so for more than 400 years. The relocation of the civilian settlement was initiated (or at least heavily supported) by Archbishop Konradin of Salzburg, probably by 1130. In March 1170, Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Barbarossa]] discussed matters associated with Salzburg\u2019s authority in Leibnitz, and an imperial document dated 14 June 1178 granted full jurisdiction to Salzburg.\n\nThe transition decades from the [[Middle Ages]] proved extremely turbulent and destructive to the area around Leibnitz, as it was to all the south-east parts of modern Austria. The fact that Leibnitz was not fortified certainly contributed to the decision of Archbishop Bernhard von Rorer in 1479 to hand the township over to the invading [[Hungary|Hungarians]]; their occupation collapsed in 1490 and Austria quickly reclaimed Leibnitz, severely punishing those leading citizens who had collaborated with the Hungarians.\n\nIn the 18th and early 19th century, when Leibnitz had about 1,000 occupants, the town burned to the ground twice, on 29 May 1709 and again on 8\u20139 September 1829. By 1883 the population had risen to 2,471 and on 27 April 1913 [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] emperor [[Franz Josef&nbsp;I of Austria]] formally elevated Leibnitz to city rank.\n\nBy 1 January 1968 the population of Leibnitz had reached 6,641 but its relative importance and vitality had severely declined since [[Lower Styria]] had fallen to [[Yugoslavia]] in 1919 as a consequence of [[World War&nbsp;I]], severing the city\u2019s vital connections to the south and effectively making it all but a \"dead-border township.\" From the 1970s onward, when it became easier for Yugoslav citizens to travel to Austria, Leibnitz started to experience a marked economic reinvigoration which gained momentum with the establishment of [[Slovenia]] as an independent state in 1991, and its entry into the [[European Union]] in 2004.\n\n==Local council==\nThe elections in 2015 showed the following results:\n* 16 seats [[SP\u00d6]]\n* 8 seats [[\u00d6VP]]\n* 4 seats [[FP\u00d6]]\n* 2 seats The Greens - The Green Alternative\n* 1 seat ''B\u00fcrgerforum Leibnitz''\n\n==Main sights==\n* The ruins of the Roman settlement of [[Flavia Solva]] near the village [[Wagna]]\n* [[Schloss Seggau]], a castle situated above the town on the Seggauberg. Founded in the 12th century by Archbishop Konrad&nbsp;I of [[Salzburg]], it now accommodates a conference center\n* The church on the Frauenberg on the hill (381 m) of the same name\n* Leibnitz Abbey\n\n==Culture and recreation==\nLeibnitz has a [[Movie theater|cinema]], an [[ice rink]] located in the center, and an open-air [[swimming pool]] with [[campsite]] and [[tennis]] courts. These facilities are enjoyed both by locals and passing tourist traffic on its way to the [[Adriatic]].\n\nInteresting annual events include a fall festival with harvest thanksgiving procession, Leibnitz \"wine week\" and a \"[[Paganism in the Eastern Alps#Perchten|Perchtenlauf]]\".\n\nThe [[vineyard]]-rich hilly countryside is home to many traditional wine-drinking establishments known as \"[[Heuriger|Buschenschenke]]\", where the local produce can be readily tasted.\n\nThe area is also crisscrossed by cycle trails, which are particularly popular in summer and fall. Leibnitz is situated on a branch of the cycle track which runs alongside the Mur river from Graz to the Slovenian border. Another cycle track alongside the river Sulm leads to [[Gleinst\u00e4tten]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\n Leibnitz town hall 21-12-2005.jpg|<center>Town Hall</center>\n Leibnitz parish church21-12-2005.jpg|<center>Catholic church of<br/>Saint James</center>\n Seggau castle near Leibnitz 21-12- 2005.jpg|<center>Seggau Castle<br/>(near Leibnitz)</center>\n Leibnitz2008.JPG|<center>Harvest Festival Procession (2008)</center>\n Perchtenlauf2009.jpg|<center>Procession with [[Perchta]]<br/>(November 2009)</center>\n</gallery>\n\n==Economy==\nThe area surrounding Leibnitz (known as the \"Leibnitzer Feld\") is extensively cultivated, the main crops being [[maize]] and [[pumpkin]].
