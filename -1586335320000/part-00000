The composition and powers of the Senate are established in Chapter I of the [[Constitution of Australia]]. There are a total of 76 Senators: 12 are elected from each of the six [[states and territories of Australia|Australian states]] regardless of population and 2 from each of the two autonomous internal [[states and territories of Australia|Australian territories]] (the [[Australian Capital Territory]] and the [[Northern Territory]]). Senators are popularly elected under the [[single transferable vote]] system of [[proportional representation]].\n\nUnlike upper houses in other [[Westminster system|Westminster-style parliamentary systems]], the Senate is vested with significant powers, including the capacity to reject all bills, including budget and appropriation bills, initiated by the government in the House of Representatives, making it a distinctive hybrid of British [[Westminster system|Westminster bicameralism]] and United States-style [[bicameralism]]. As a result of proportional representation, the chamber features a multitude of parties vying for power. The governing party or coalition, which has to maintain the confidence of the lower house, has not held a majority in the Senate since 2005-2007 (and before that since 1981) and usually needs to negotiate with other parties and independents to get legislation passed.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=George|last2=Brennan|first2=Sean|last3=Lynch|first3=Andrew|title=Blackshield and Williams Australian constitutional law and theory : commentary and materials|date=2014|publisher=Federation Press|location=Annandale, NSW|isbn=9781862879188|page=415|edition=6th}}</ref>\n\n==Origins and role==\n[[File:Australian Senate 1923.jpg|thumb|The Australian Senate in 1923]]\nThe [[Constitution of Australia|Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act (Imp.)]] of 1900 established the Senate as part of the system of [[dominion]] government in newly [[Federation of Australia|federated Australia]]. From a comparative governmental perspective, the Australian Senate exhibits distinctive characteristics. Unlike upper Houses in other [[Westminster system]] governments, the Senate is not a vestigial body with limited legislative power. Rather it was intended to play \u2013 and does play \u2013 an active role in legislation. Rather than being modeled solely after the [[House of Lords]], as the [[Senate of Canada]] was, the Australian Senate was in part modeled after the [[United States Senate]], by giving equal representation to each state and equal powers with the lower house.<ref name=\"Part V\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/~/link.aspx?_id=AFF6CA564BC3465AA325E73053DED4AA&_z=z#chapter-01_part-05_53|title=Part V - Powers of the Parliament|language=en-AU|access-date=13 May 2017}}</ref> The Constitution intended to give less populous states added voice in a Federal legislature, while also providing for the revising role of an upper house in the Westminster system.\n\nAlthough the [[Prime Minister of Australia]] and [[Treasurer of Australia]], by convention, are members of the House of Representatives (after [[John Gorton]] was appointed prime minister in 1968, he resigned from the Senate and was elected to the House), other members of the [[Cabinet of Australia]] may come from either house,<ref name=\"senatebrief14\">{{cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/Senate_Briefs/Brief14 |title=No. 14 - Ministers in the Senate |date=December 2016 |website=Senate Briefs |publisher=Parliament of Australia}}</ref> and the two Houses have almost equal legislative power.<ref name=\"Part V\"/> As with most upper chambers in [[bicameralism|bicameral parliament]]s, the Senate cannot introduce or amend [[appropriation bill]]s (bills that authorise government expenditure of public revenue) or bills that impose taxation, that role being reserved for the lower house; it can only approve, reject or defer them. That degree of equality between the Senate and House of Representatives reflects the desire of the Constitution's authors to address smaller states' desire for strong powers for the Senate as a way of ensuring that the interests of more populous states as represented in the House of Representatives did not totally dominate the government. This situation was also partly due to the age of the Australian constitution&nbsp; it was enacted before the confrontation in 1909 in Britain between the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] and the [[House of Lords]], which ultimately resulted in the restrictions placed on the powers of the House of Lords by the [[Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949]].\n\nIn practice, however, most legislation (except for [[private member's bill]]s) in the Australian Parliament is initiated by the Government, which has control over the lower house. It is then passed to the Senate, which has the opportunity to amend the bill, pass or reject it. In the majority of cases, voting takes place along [[Party line (politics)|party lines]], although there are occasional [[conscience vote]]s.\n\n[[File:Senate, Old Parliament House, Canberra.JPG|thumb|The Senate chamber at [[Old Parliament House, Canberra]], where the Parliament met between 1927 and 1988.]]\n\n==Electoral system==\n{{see also|Electoral system of Australia}} \nThe system for electing senators has changed several times since [[Federation of Australia|Federation]]. The original arrangement involved a [[first-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post]] and [[Plurality-at-large voting|block voting]] or \"winner takes all\" system, on a state-by-state basis. This was replaced in 1919 by [[preferential block voting]]. Block voting tended to produce [[Landslide victory|landslide]] majorities and even \"wipe-outs\". For instance, from 1920 to 1923 the [[Nationalist Party (Australia)|Nationalist Party]] held all but one of the 36 seats, and from 1947 to 1950, the [[Australian Labor Party]] held all but three.\n\nIn 1948, [[single transferable vote]] with [[proportional representation]] on a state-by-state basis became the method for electing Senators. This had the effect of limiting the government's ability to control the chamber, and has helped the rise of Australian minor parties.<ref name = \"electing\" />\n\nFrom the [[1984 Australian federal election|1984 election]] onwards, [[group voting tickets in Australia|group ticket voting]] was introduced, in order to reduce a high rate of informal voting that arose from the requirement that each candidate be given a preference, and to allow small parties and independent candidates a reasonable chance of winning a seat. This allowed voters to select a single party \"Above the Line\" to distribute their preferences on their behalf, but voters were still able to vote directly for individual candidates and distribute their own preferences if they wished \"Below the Line\" by numbering every box.<ref name=\"Antony Green\">{{cite web |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-09-23/the-origin-of-senate-group-ticket-voting-and-it-didnt-come-from-/9388658 |title=The Origin of Senate Group Ticket Voting, and it didn't come from the Major Parties |author=[[Antony Green]] |date=23 September 2015 |publisher=ABC |accessdate=20 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn [[2016 Australian federal election|2016]], group tickets were abolished to avoid undue influence of preference deals amongst parties that were seen as distorting election results<ref name=\"ABC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-26/aec-advertising-campaign-on-way-senators-are-elected/7356308|title=Senate voting changes explained in AEC advertisements|date=26 April 2016|website=abc.net.au|accessdate=9 August 2018}}</ref> and  a form of [[optional preferential voting]] was introduced. As a result of the changes, voters may assign their preferences for parties above the line (numbering as many boxes as they wish), or individual candidates below the line, and are not required to fill all of the boxes. Both above and below the line voting now use [[optional preferential voting]]. For above the line, voters are instructed to number at least their first six preferences; however, a \"savings provision\" is in place to ensure that ballots will still be counted if less than six are given. For below the line, voters are required to number at least their first 12 preferences. Voters are free to continue numbering as many preferences as they like beyond the minimum number specified. Another savings provision allows ballot papers with at least 6 below the line preferences to be formal. The voting changes make it more difficult for new small parties and independent candidates to be elected to the Senate, but also allow a voter to voluntarily \"exhaust\" preferences \u2014 that is, to ensure their vote cannot flow to specific candidates or Parties \u2014 in the event that none of the voter's candidates preferences are elected.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://theconversation.com/explainer-how-does-preferential-voting-work-in-the-senate-116347 |title=Explainer: how does preferential voting work in the Senate? |author=Stephen Morey |date=2 May 2019 |publisher=The Conversation |accessdate=27 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe changes were subject to a challenge in front of [[High Court of Australia]] by sitting South Australian Senator [[Bob Day]] of the [[Family First Party]]. The senator argued that the changes meant the senators would not be \"directly chosen by the people\" as required by the constitution. The High Court rejected Day's challenge unanimously, deciding that both above the line and below the line voting were consistent with the constitution.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/13/high-court-rejects-bob-day-appeal-and-finds-senate-voting-changes-are-legal High court rejects Bob Day appeal and finds Senate voting changes are legal], [[The Guardian]], 13 May 2016</ref><ref name=2016DAY>''Day v Australian Electoral Officer for the State of South Australia'' {{Cite AustLII|HCA|20|2016}}</ref>\n\n===Ballot paper===\nThe Australian Senate voting paper under the single transferable vote proportional representation system resembles the following example (shown in two parts), which shows the candidates for [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] senate representation in the [[2016 Australian federal election|2016 federal election]].\n\n[[File:Victorian-senate-paper-folded-01.png|640x640px|thumb|center|Senate ballot paper used in Victoria for 2016]]\n\nTo vote correctly, electors must either:\n* Vote for at least six parties above the thick black line, by writing the numbers 1-6 in party boxes.

Once a candidate has been elected with votes reaching the quota amount, any votes they receive in addition to this may be distributed to other candidates as preferences.\n\nWith an odd number of seats in a half-Senate election (3 or 5), 50.1% of the vote wins a majority (2/3) or (3/5).\n\nWith an even number of seats in a half-Senate election (6), 57.1% of the vote is needed to win a majority of seats (4/6).\n\nThe ungrouped candidates in the far right column do not have a box above the line. Therefore, they can only get a primary (number 1) vote from electors who vote below the line.  For this reason, some independents register as a group, either with other independents or by themselves, such as group B in the above example.\n\nNames of parties can be shown only if the parties are registered, which requires, among other things, a minimum of 500 members.\n\n=== Order of parties ===\nThe order of parties on the ballot papers and the order of ungrouped candidates are determined by a random ballot conducted by the Electoral Commission.\n\n=== Deposit ===\nCandidates, parties and groups pay a deposit of $2000 per candidate, which is forfeited if they fail to achieve 4% of the primary vote.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.aec.gov.au/Elections/candidates/ |title=Candidate information |date=17 October 2019 |publisher=[[Australian Electoral Commission]] |accessdate=27 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Public subsidy ===\nCandidates, parties and groups earn a public subsidy if they gain at least 4% of the primary vote.

The Constitution originally provided for six senators for each state, resulting in a total of 36 senators.\n\nThe Constitution permits the Parliament to increase the number of senators, provided that equal numbers of senators from each original state are maintained; accordingly, in 1948, Senate representation was increased from 6 to 10 senators for each state, increasing the total to 60.\n\nIn 1975, the two territories, the [[Northern Territory]] and the [[Australian Capital Territory]], were given an entitlement to elect two senators each for the first time, bringing the number to 64.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/sota1973408/ |title=Senate (Representation of Territories) Act 1973.

Retrieved August 2007.</ref>\n\n===Term===\nSenators normally serve fixed six-year terms (from 1 July to 30 June). At most federal elections, the seats of 40 of the 76 Senators (half of the 72 Senators from the six states and all four of the Senators from the territories) are contested, along with the entire House of Representatives; such an election is sometimes known as a half-Senate election. The seats of Senators elected at a half-Senate election are not contested at the next election, provided it is a half-Senate election. However, under some circumstances, the entire Senate (and the House of Representatives) is dissolved early, in what is known as a [[double dissolution]]. Following a double dissolution, half the Senators representing states serve terms ending on the third 30 June following the election (two to three years) and the rest serve a five to six-year term. [[Section 13 of the Constitution of Australia#Allocation of terms|Section 13 of the Constitution]] requires the Senate to allocate long and short terms amongst its members. The term of Senators representing a territory expires at the same time as there is an election for the House of Representatives. While there is no constitutional requirement for the election of Senators to take place at the same time as those for members of the House of Representatives, the government usually synchronises the dates of elections for the Senate and House of Representatives.\n\nSection 13 of the Constitution requires that in half-Senate elections, the election of State senators shall take place within one year before the places become vacant. The actual election date is determined by the Governor of each State, who acts on the advice of the State Premier. The Governors almost always act on the recommendation of the Governor-General, with the last independent Senate election writ being issued by the Governor of Queensland during the [[Gair Affair]] in 1974.\n\nSlightly more than half of the Senate is contested at each general election (half of the 72 state senators, and all four of the territory senators), along with the entire House of Representatives. Except in the case of a [[double dissolution]], senators for the states are elected for fixed terms of six years, commencing on 1 July following the election, and ceasing on 30 June six years later.\n\nThe term of the four senators from the territories is not fixed, but is defined by the dates of the general elections for the House of Representatives, the period between which can vary greatly, to a maximum of three years and three months. Territory senators commence their terms on the day that they are elected. Their terms expire the day prior to the following general election day.<ref>[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/sota1973408/s6.html ''Section 6 of the Senate (Representation of Territories) Act 1973'']. Retrieved August 2010.</ref>\n\nWhile there is no constitutional requirement for the election of Senators to take place at the same time as those for members of the House of Representatives, the government usually synchronises the dates of elections for the Senate and House of Representatives. However, because their terms do not coincide, the incoming Parliament will for some time comprise the new House of Representatives and the old Senate, except for the senators representing the territories, until the new senators start their term on the next 1 July.\n\nFollowing a double dissolution, all 76 senators face re-election. If there is an early House election outside the 12-month period in which Senate elections can occur, the synchronisation of the election will be disrupted, and there can be half-Senate elections without a concurrent House election. The last time this occurred was on [[1970 Australian Senate election|21 November 1970]].\n\n===Quota Size===\nThe number of votes that a candidate must receive to be elected to the senate is referred to as a 'Quota'. The quota is worked out by dividing the number of formal votes by one more than the number of vacancies to be filled and then adding one to the result.<ref name = \"count\">https://aec.gov.au/Voting/counting/files/senate-count-process.pdf</ref> The 2019 senate election was a half senate election, so 6 senate vacancies were contested in each state.

[[Tasmania]], with a population of around 500,000, elects the same number of senators as [[New South Wales]], which has a population of over 7 million. Because of this imbalance, governments favoured by the more populous states are occasionally frustrated by the extra power the smaller states have in the Senate, to the degree that former Prime Minister [[Paul Keating]] famously referred to the Senate's members as \"unrepresentative swill\".<ref>[http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22chamber%2Fhansardr%2F1992-11-04%2F0030%22 Question without Notice: Loan Council Arrangements] House Hansard,</ref> The proportional election system within each state ensures that the Senate incorporates more political diversity than the lower house, which is basically a [[Two-party system|two party]] body.

When the Senate had an odd number of Senators retiring at an election (3 or 5), 51% of the vote would lead to a clear majority of 3 out of 5 per state. With an even number of Senators retiring at an election, it takes 57% of the vote to win 4 out of 6 seats, which may be insurmountable. This gives the House an unintended extra advantage in joint sittings but not in ordinary elections, where the Senate may be too evenly balanced to get House legislation through.\n\nThe Government does not need the support of the Senate to stay in office; however, the Senate can block or defer supply, an action that precipitated a [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|constitutional crisis in 1975]]. However, if the governing party does not have a majority in the Senate, it can often find its agenda frustrated in the upper house. This can be the case even when the government has a large majority in the House.\n\n===Parties===\nThe overwhelming majority of senators have always been elected as representatives of political parties. Parties which currently have representation in the Senate are:\n* [[Coalition (Australia)|The Coalition]] \u2013 [[Liberal Party of Australia]], [[National Party of Australia]]\n* [[Australian Labor Party]]\n* [[Australian Greens]]\n* [[Pauline Hanson's One Nation]]\n* [[Centre Alliance]]\n* [[Jacqui Lambie Network]]\n\nOther parties that have achieved Senate representation in the past include the [[Australian Conservatives]], [[United Australia Party (2013)|United Australia]], [[Derryn Hinch's Justice Party]], [[Family First Party]], [[Australian Democrats]], [[Palmer United Party]], [[Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party]], [[Nuclear Disarmament Party]], [[Liberal Movement (Australia)|Liberal Movement]], [[Liberal Democratic Party (Australia)|Liberal Democratic Party]], the [[Democratic Labour Party (Australia)|Democratic Labour Party]] and the related but separate [[Democratic Labor Party (historical)|Democratic Labor Party]].\n\nDue to the need to obtain votes statewide, [[Independent politicians in Australia|independent candidates]] have difficulty getting elected. The exceptions in recent times have been elected in less populous States\u2014the former Tasmanian Senator [[Brian Harradine]] and the former South Australian Senator [[Nick Xenophon]]. It is less uncommon for a senator initially elected representing a party to become an independent, most recently in the cases of Senator [[Lucy Gichuhi]] resigning from Family First, Senators [[Rod Culleton]] and [[Fraser Anning]] resigning from One Nation, and Senator [[Steve Martin (Australian politician)|Steve Martin]] being expelled from the Jacqui Lambie Network.\n\nThe Australian Senate serves as a model for some politicians in Canada, particularly in the Western provinces, who wish to reform the [[Senate of Canada|Canadian Senate]] so that it takes a more active legislative role.<ref>Ted Morton, [http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Research_and_Education/pops/pop39/morton 'Senate Envy: Why Western Canada Wants What Australia Has'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514175438/http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Research_and_Education/pops/pop39/morton |date=14 May 2013 }}, ''Senate Envy and Other Lectures in the Senate Occasional Lecture Series, 2001\u20132002'', Department of the Senate, Canberra.</ref>\n\nThere are also small factions in the United Kingdom (both from the right and left) who wish to the see the House of Lords take on a structure similar to that of the Australian Senate.<ref>{{cite book| last = Renwick| first = Alan| authorlink =| title = House of Lords Reform: A Briefing Paper | publisher = Political Studies Association| year = 2011| url = https://www.psa.ac.uk/sites/default/files/HL%20Reform%20briefing%20paper.pdf| isbn = }}</ref>\n\n===Casual vacancies===\n{{see also|Casual vacancies in the Australian Parliament|List of Australian Senate appointments}}\nSection 15 of the Constitution provides that a [[Casual vacancies in the Australian Parliament|casual vacancy]] of a State senator shall be filled by the State Parliament. If the previous senator was a member of a particular political party the replacement must come from the same party, but the State Parliament may choose not to fill the vacancy, in which case Section 11 requires the Senate to proceed regardless. If the State Parliament happens to be in recess when the vacancy occurs, the Constitution provides that the State Governor can appoint someone to fill the place until fourteen days after the State Parliament resumes sitting.\n\n== Procedure ==\n[[File:Senate panorama.jpg|thumb|400px|The Australian Senate]]\n\n=== Work ===\nThe Australian Senate typically sits for 50 to 60 days a year.{{efn|Figures are available for each year on the Senate StatsNet.}} Most of those days are grouped into 'sitting fortnights' of two four-day weeks. These are in turn arranged in three periods: the autumn sittings, from February to April; the winter sittings, which commence with the delivery of the budget in the House of Representatives on the first sitting day of May and run through to June or July; and the spring sittings, which commence around August and continue until December, and which typically contain the largest number of the year's sitting days.\n\nThe senate has a regular schedule that structures its typical working week.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/work/routineofbus.htm |title=Senate weekly routine of business |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=7 November 2011 |publisher=Australian Senate |access-date= |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126125039/http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/work/routineofbus.htm |archive-date=26 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n====Dealing with legislation====\nAll [[bill (law)|bills]] must be passed by a majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate before they become law. Most bills originate in the House of Representatives, and the great majority are introduced by the government.\n\nThe usual procedure is for notice to be given by a government minister the day before the bill is introduced into the Senate. Once introduced the bill goes through several stages of consideration. It is given a [[reading (legislature)|first reading]], which represents the bill's formal introduction into the chamber.\n\n<blockquote>The first reading is followed by debate on the principle or policy of the bill (the second reading debate). Agreement to the bill in principle is indicated by a second reading, after which the detailed provisions of the bill are considered by one of a number of methods (see below). Bills may also be referred by either House to their specialised standing or select committees. Agreement to the policy and the details is confirmed by a third and final reading. These processes ensure that a bill is systematically considered before being agreed to.<ref>Australian Senate, [http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/pubs/briefs/brief08.htm 'The Senate and Legislation'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924114919/http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/pubs/briefs/brief08.htm |date=24 September 2008 }}, ''Senate Brief'', No. 8, 2008, Department of the Senate, Canberra.</ref></blockquote>\nThe Senate has detailed rules in its standing orders that govern how a bill is considered at each stage.<ref>Australian Senate, [http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/pubs/guides/briefno09.htm 'Consideration of legislation'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926083250/http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/pubs/guides/briefno09.htm |date=26 September 2008 }}, ''Brief Guides to Senate Procedure'', No. 9, Department of the Senate, Canberra.</ref> This process of consideration can vary greatly in the amount of time taken. Consideration of some bills is completed in a single day, while complex or controversial legislation may take months to pass through all stages of Senate scrutiny. The Constitution provides that if the Senate vote is equal, the question shall pass in the negative.\n\n====Committees====\n{{Main|Australian Senate committees}}\n[[Image:AustralianSenateCommitteeRm.JPG|thumb|alt=A meeting room containing a large horseshoe-shaped desk, with red leather office chairs surrounding its outside edge, a microphone mounted in the desk in front of each chair|A Senate committee room in Parliament House, Canberra]]\n[[File:Australian Parliament Parliamentary Committees.webm|thumb|left|A short video on Australian Parliamentary Committees]]\nIn addition to the work of the main chamber, the Senate also has a large number of [[Australian Senate committees|committees]] which deal with matters referred to them by the Senate. These committees also conduct hearings three times a year in which the government's budget and operations are examined. These are known as estimates hearings. Traditionally dominated by scrutiny of government activities by non-government senators, they provide the opportunity for all senators to ask questions of ministers and public officials. This may occasionally include government senators examining activities of independent publicly funded bodies, or pursuing issues arising from previous governments' terms of office. There is however a convention that senators do not have access to the files and records of previous governments when there has been an election resulting in a change in the party in government. Once a particular inquiry is completed the members of the committee can then produce a report, to be tabled in Parliament, outlining what they have discovered as well as any recommendations that they have produced for the Government to consider.<ref name = \"odgcom\">{{cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/Odgers_Australian_Senate_Practice/Chapter_16 |title=Odgers' Australian Senate Practice Fourteenth Edition Chapter 16 - Committees|date=2017 |accessdate=19 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe ability of the Houses of Parliament to establish committees is referenced in Section 49 of the Constitution, which states that, \"''The powers, privileges, and immunities of the Senate and of the House of Representatives, and of the members and the committees of each House, shall be such as are declared by the Parliament, and until declared shall be those of the Commons House of Parliament of the United Kingdom, and of its members and committees, at the establishment of the Commonwealth.''\"<ref name=\"con49\">[[Constitution of Australia]], section 49.</ref><ref name = \"odgcom\"/>\n\nParliamentary committees can be given a wide range of powers. One of the most significant powers is the ability to summon people to attend hearings in order to give evidence and submit documents. Anyone who attempts to hinder the work of a Parliamentary committee may be found to be in [[contempt of Parliament]]. There are a number of ways that witnesses can be found in contempt, these include; refusing to appear before a committee when summoned, refusing to answer a question during a hearing or to produce a document, or later being found to have lied to or misled a committee. Anyone who attempts to influence a witness may also be found in contempt.<ref name=\"com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/Powers_practice_and_procedure/00_-_Infosheets/Infosheet_4_-_Committees |title=Infosheet 4 - Committees |publisher=aph.gov.au |date= |accessdate=22 February 2017}}</ref> Other powers include the ability to meet throughout Australia, to establish subcommittees and to take evidence in both public and private hearings.<ref name = \"odgcom\"/>\n\nProceedings of committees are considered to have the same legal standing as proceedings of Parliament. They are recorded by [[Hansard]], except for private hearings, and also operate under [[Parliamentary privilege]]. Every participant, including committee members and witnesses giving evidence, is protected from being prosecuted under any civil or criminal action for anything they may say during a hearing. Written evidence and documents received by a committee are also protected.<ref name=\"com\"/><ref name = \"odgcom\"/>\n\n====Holding governments to account====\nOne of the functions of the Senate, both directly and through its [[Australian Senate committees|committees]], is to scrutinise government activity. The vigour of this scrutiny has been fuelled for many years by the fact that the party in government has seldom had a majority in the Senate. Whereas in the House of Representatives the government's majority has sometimes limited that chamber's capacity to implement executive scrutiny, the opposition and minor parties have been able to use their Senate numbers as a basis for conducting inquiries into government operations. When the [[Howard Government]] won control of the Senate in 2005, it sparked a debate about the effectiveness of the Senate in holding the government of the day accountable for its actions. Government members argued that the Senate continued to be a forum of vigorous debate, and its committees continued to be active.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.financeminister.gov.au/media/2006/mr_432006.html |title=Media Release 43/2006 \u2013 Senate remains robust under Government majority |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=30 June 2006 |website= |publisher= |access-date= |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927145249/http://www.financeminister.gov.au/media/2006/mr_432006.html |archive-date=27 September 2007}}</ref> The Opposition leader in the Senate suggested that the government had attenuated the scrutinising activities of the Senate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chrisevans.alp.org.au/news/1105/senatespeeches10-01.php |title=Senator Chris Evans, The tyranny of the majority (speech) |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=10 November 2005 |website= |publisher= |access-date= |quote=\"Labor has accused the Government of 'ramming' bills through the Senate \u2013 but Labor \"guillotined\" Parliamentary debate more than twice the number of times in their 13 years in Government than the Coalition has over the last decade.

These votes are called ''divisions'' in the case of Senate business, or ''ballots'' where the vote is to choose a senator to fill an office of the Senate (such as the [[President of the Senate (Australia)|President]]).<ref>''Senate Standing Orders'', numbers 7, 10, 98\u2013105, 163</ref>\n\nParty discipline in [[Politics of Australia|Australian politics]] is extremely tight, so divisions almost always are decided on party lines. Nevertheless, the existence of minor parties holding the balance of power in the Senate has made divisions in that chamber more important and occasionally more dramatic than in the House of Representatives.\n\nWhen a division is to be held, bells ring throughout the parliament building for four minutes, during which time senators must go to the chamber. At the end of that period the doors are locked and a vote is taken, by identifying and counting senators according to the side of the chamber on which they sit (ayes to the right of the chair, noes to the left). The whole procedure takes around eight minutes. Senators with commitments that keep them from the chamber may make arrangements in advance to be 'paired' with a senator of the opposite political party, so that their absence does not affect the outcome of the vote.\n\nThe Senate contains an even number of senators, so a tied vote is a real prospect (which regularly occurs when the party numbers in the chamber are finely balanced). [[Section 23 of the Constitution of Australia|Section 23 of the Constitution]] requires that in the event of a tied division, the question is resolved in the negative. The system is however different for ballots for offices such as the President. If such a ballot is tied, the [[Clerk of the Australian Senate|Clerk of the Senate]] decides the outcome by the drawing of lots. In reality, conventions govern most ballots, so this situation does not arise.\n\n====Political parties and voting outcomes====\nThe extent to which party discipline determines the outcome of parliamentary votes is highlighted by the rarity with which members of the same political party will find themselves on opposing sides of a vote.

In such an event, the entirety of the Senate faces re-election, as does the House of Representatives, rather than only about half the chamber as is normally the case. After a double dissolution election, if the bills in question are reintroduced, and if they again fail to pass the Senate, the Governor-General may agree to a ''joint sitting'' of the two Houses in an attempt to pass the bills. [[Joint Sitting of the Australian Parliament of 1974|Such a sitting]] has only occurred once, in 1974.\n\nThe double dissolution mechanism is not available for bills that originate in the Senate and are blocked in the lower house.\n\nAfter a double dissolution election, section 13 of the Constitution requires the Senate to divide the senators into two classes, with the first class having a three-year \"short term\", and the second class a six-year \"long term\". The Senate may adopt any approach it wants to determine how to allocate the long and short terms, however two methods are currently 'on the table':\n* \"elected-order\" method, where the Senators elected first attain a six-year term. This approach tends to favour minor party candidates as it gives greater weight to their first preference votes;<ref name=\"whichones\">{{cite web\n| url         = http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-07-05/election-2016-new-senate-terms-explained/7571406\n| title       = Election 2016: How do we decide which senators are in for three years and which are in for six?\n| author      = Uma Patel\n| publisher   = Australian Broadcasting Corporation\n| date        = 6 July 2016}}</ref> or\n* re-count method, where the long terms are allocated to those Senators who would have been elected first if the election had been a standard half-Senate election.<ref name=\"longnshort\">{{cite web\n| url         = http://blogs.abc.net.au/antonygreen/2016/04/how-long-and-short-terms-are-allocated-after-a-double-dissolution.html\n| title       = How Long and Short Senate Terms are Allocated After a Double Dissolution\n| author      = [[Antony Green]]\n| publisher   = Australian Broadcasting Corporation\n| date        = 25 April 2016}}</ref> This method is likely to be preferred by the major parties in the Senate where it would deliver more six-year terms to their members.<ref name=whichones />\n\nThe Senate applied the \"elected-order\" method following the [[1987 Australian federal election|1987 double dissolution election]].<ref name=longnshort /> Since that time the Senate has passed resolutions on several occasions indicating its intention to use the re-count method to allocate seats at any future double dissolution, which Green describes as a fairer approach but notes could be ignored if a majority of Senators opted for the \"elected-order\" method instead.<ref name=longnshort /> In both double dissolution elections since 1987, the \"elected order\" method was used.\n\nOn 8 October 2003, the then Prime Minister [[John Howard]] initiated public discussion of whether the mechanism for the resolution of deadlocks between the Houses should be reformed.

Because of the principles of responsible government a Prime Minister who cannot obtain supply, including money for carrying on the ordinary services of government, must either advise a general election or resign. If he refuses to do this I have the authority and indeed the duty under the Constitution to withdraw his Commission as Prime Minister. The position in Australia is quite different from a position in the United Kingdom. Here the confidence of both Houses on supply is necessary to ensure its provision. In United Kingdom the confidence of the House of Commons alone is necessary. But both here and in the United Kingdom the duty of the Prime Minister is the same in a most important aspect \u2013 if he cannot get supply he must resign or advise an election.|author=Governor-General [[John Kerr (governor-general)|Sir John Kerr]]|source=Statement (dated 11 November 1975)<ref name=kerr>{{cite web|last1=Kerr|first1=John|title=Statement from John Kerr (dated 11 November 1975) explaining his decisions.|url=http://whitlamdismissal.com/documents/kerr-statement.shtml|website=WhitlamDismissal.com|accessdate=11 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223060041/http://whitlamdismissal.com/documents/kerr-statement.shtml|archive-date=23 February 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>}}\n\nThe constitutional text denies the Senate the power to originate or amend appropriation bills, in deference to the conventions of the classical [[Westminster system]]. Under a traditional Westminster system, the [[executive (government)|executive]] government is responsible for its use of public funds to the lower house, which has the power to bring down a government by [[Loss of supply|blocking its access to supply]]&nbsp;\u2013 i.e. [[revenue]] appropriated through taxation. The arrangement as expressed in the Australian Constitution, however, still leaves the Senate with the power to reject supply bills or defer their passage&nbsp;\u2013 undoubtedly one of the Senate's most powerful abilities.\n\nThe ability to block supply was exercised in the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis]]. The [[Opposition (Australia)|Opposition]] used its numbers in the Senate to defer supply bills, refusing to deal with them until an election was called for both Houses of Parliament, an election which it hoped to win. The [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] of the day, [[Gough Whitlam]], contested the legitimacy of the blocking and refused to resign. The crisis brought to a head two Westminster conventions that, under the Australian constitutional system, were in conflict&nbsp;\u2013 firstly, that a government may continue to govern for as long as it has the support of the [[lower house]], and secondly, that a government that no longer has access to supply must either resign or be dismissed. The crisis was resolved in November 1975 when Governor-General [[John Kerr (governor-general)|Sir John Kerr]] dismissed Whitlam's government and appointed a caretaker government on condition that elections for both Houses of parliament be held.<ref name=kerr/> This action in itself was a source of controversy and debate at that time on the proper usage of the Senate's ability to block supply.\n\nThe blocking of supply alone cannot force a double dissolution. There must be legislation repeatedly blocked by the Senate which the government can then choose to use as a trigger for a double dissolution.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Green|first1=Antony|title=An Early Double Dissolution?

The composition and powers of the Senate are established in Chapter I of the [[Constitution of Australia]]. There are a total of 76 Senators: 12 are elected from each of the six [[states and territories of Australia|Australian states]] regardless of population and 2 from each of the two autonomous internal [[states and territories of Australia|Australian territories]] (the [[Australian Capital Territory]] and the [[Northern Territory]]). Senators are popularly elected under the [[single transferable vote]] system of [[proportional representation]].\n\nUnlike upper houses in other [[Westminster system|Westminster-style parliamentary systems]], the Senate is vested with significant powers, including the capacity to reject all bills, including budget and appropriation bills, initiated by the government in the House of Representatives, making it a distinctive hybrid of British [[Westminster system|Westminster bicameralism]] and United States-style [[bicameralism]]. As a result of proportional representation, the chamber features a multitude of parties vying for power. The governing party or coalition, which has to maintain the confidence of the lower house, has not held a majority in the Senate since 2005-2007 (and before that since 1981) and usually needs to negotiate with other parties and independents to get legislation passed.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=George|last2=Brennan|first2=Sean|last3=Lynch|first3=Andrew|title=Blackshield and Williams Australian constitutional law and theory : commentary and materials|date=2014|publisher=Federation Press|location=Annandale, NSW|isbn=9781862879188|page=415|edition=6th}}</ref>\n\n==Origins and role==\n[[File:Australian Senate 1923.jpg|thumb|The Australian Senate in 1923]]\nThe [[Constitution of Australia|Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act (Imp.)]] of 1900 established the Senate as part of the system of [[dominion]] government in newly [[Federation of Australia|federated Australia]]. From a comparative governmental perspective, the Australian Senate exhibits distinctive characteristics. Unlike upper Houses in other [[Westminster system]] governments, the Senate is not a vestigial body with limited legislative power. Rather it was intended to play \u2013 and does play \u2013 an active role in legislation. Rather than being modeled solely after the [[House of Lords]], as the [[Senate of Canada]] was, the Australian Senate was in part modeled after the [[United States Senate]], by giving equal representation to each state and equal powers with the lower house.<ref name=\"Part V\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/~/link.aspx?_id=AFF6CA564BC3465AA325E73053DED4AA&_z=z#chapter-01_part-05_53|title=Part V - Powers of the Parliament|language=en-AU|access-date=13 May 2017}}</ref> The Constitution intended to give less populous states added voice in a Federal legislature, while also providing for the revising role of an upper house in the Westminster system.\n\nAlthough the [[Prime Minister of Australia]] and [[Treasurer of Australia]], by convention, are members of the House of Representatives (after [[John Gorton]] was appointed prime minister in 1968, he resigned from the Senate and was elected to the House), other members of the [[Cabinet of Australia]] may come from either house,<ref name=\"senatebrief14\">{{cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/Senate_Briefs/Brief14 |title=No. 14 - Ministers in the Senate |date=December 2016 |website=Senate Briefs |publisher=Parliament of Australia}}</ref> and the two Houses have almost equal legislative power.<ref name=\"Part V\"/> As with most upper chambers in [[bicameralism|bicameral parliament]]s, the Senate cannot introduce or amend [[appropriation bill]]s (bills that authorise government expenditure of public revenue) or bills that impose taxation, that role being reserved for the lower house; it can only approve, reject or defer them. That degree of equality between the Senate and House of Representatives reflects the desire of the Constitution's authors to address smaller states' desire for strong powers for the Senate as a way of ensuring that the interests of more populous states as represented in the House of Representatives did not totally dominate the government. This situation was also partly due to the age of the Australian constitution&nbsp; it was enacted before the confrontation in 1909 in Britain between the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] and the [[House of Lords]], which ultimately resulted in the restrictions placed on the powers of the House of Lords by the [[Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949]].\n\nIn practice, however, most legislation (except for [[private member's bill]]s) in the Australian Parliament is initiated by the Government, which has control over the lower house. It is then passed to the Senate, which has the opportunity to amend the bill, pass or reject it. In the majority of cases, voting takes place along [[Party line (politics)|party lines]], although there are occasional [[conscience vote]]s.\n\n[[File:Senate, Old Parliament House, Canberra.JPG|thumb|The Senate chamber at [[Old Parliament House, Canberra]], where the Parliament met between 1927 and 1988.]]\n\n==Electoral system==\n{{see also|Electoral system of Australia}} \nThe system for electing senators has changed several times since [[Federation of Australia|Federation]]. The original arrangement involved a [[first-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post]] and [[Plurality-at-large voting|block voting]] or \"winner takes all\" system, on a state-by-state basis. This was replaced in 1919 by [[preferential block voting]]. Block voting tended to produce [[Landslide victory|landslide]] majorities and even \"wipe-outs\". For instance, from 1920 to 1923 the [[Nationalist Party (Australia)|Nationalist Party]] held all but one of the 36 seats, and from 1947 to 1950, the [[Australian Labor Party]] held all but three.\n\nIn 1948, [[single transferable vote]] with [[proportional representation]] on a state-by-state basis became the method for electing Senators. This had the effect of limiting the government's ability to control the chamber, and has helped the rise of Australian minor parties.<ref name = \"electing\" />\n\nFrom the [[1984 Australian federal election|1984 election]] onwards, [[group voting tickets in Australia|group ticket voting]] was introduced, in order to reduce a high rate of informal voting that arose from the requirement that each candidate be given a preference, and to allow small parties and independent candidates a reasonable chance of winning a seat. This allowed voters to select a single party \"Above the Line\" to distribute their preferences on their behalf, but voters were still able to vote directly for individual candidates and distribute their own preferences if they wished \"Below the Line\" by numbering every box.<ref name=\"Antony Green\">{{cite web |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-09-23/the-origin-of-senate-group-ticket-voting-and-it-didnt-come-from-/9388658 |title=The Origin of Senate Group Ticket Voting, and it didn't come from the Major Parties |author=[[Antony Green]] |date=23 September 2015 |publisher=ABC |accessdate=20 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn [[2016 Australian federal election|2016]], group tickets were abolished to avoid undue influence of preference deals amongst parties that were seen as distorting election results<ref name=\"ABC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-26/aec-advertising-campaign-on-way-senators-are-elected/7356308|title=Senate voting changes explained in AEC advertisements|date=26 April 2016|website=abc.net.au|accessdate=9 August 2018}}</ref> and  a form of [[optional preferential voting]] was introduced. As a result of the changes, voters may assign their preferences for parties above the line (numbering as many boxes as they wish), or individual candidates below the line, and are not required to fill all of the boxes. Both above and below the line voting now use [[optional preferential voting]]. For above the line, voters are instructed to number at least their first six preferences; however, a \"savings provision\" is in place to ensure that ballots will still be counted if less than six are given. For below the line, voters are required to number at least their first 12 preferences. Voters are free to continue numbering as many preferences as they like beyond the minimum number specified. Another savings provision allows ballot papers with at least 6 below the line preferences to be formal. The voting changes make it more difficult for new small parties and independent candidates to be elected to the Senate, but also allow a voter to voluntarily \"exhaust\" preferences \u2014 that is, to ensure their vote cannot flow to specific candidates or Parties \u2014 in the event that none of the voter's candidates preferences are elected.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://theconversation.com/explainer-how-does-preferential-voting-work-in-the-senate-116347 |title=Explainer: how does preferential voting work in the Senate? |author=Stephen Morey |date=2 May 2019 |publisher=The Conversation |accessdate=27 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe changes were subject to a challenge in front of [[High Court of Australia]] by sitting South Australian Senator [[Bob Day]] of the [[Family First Party]]. The senator argued that the changes meant the senators would not be \"directly chosen by the people\" as required by the constitution. The High Court rejected Day's challenge unanimously, deciding that both above the line and below the line voting were consistent with the constitution.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/13/high-court-rejects-bob-day-appeal-and-finds-senate-voting-changes-are-legal High court rejects Bob Day appeal and finds Senate voting changes are legal], [[The Guardian]], 13 May 2016</ref><ref name=2016DAY>''Day v Australian Electoral Officer for the State of South Australia'' {{Cite AustLII|HCA|20|2016}}</ref>\n\n===Ballot paper===\nThe Australian Senate voting paper under the single transferable vote proportional representation system resembles the following example (shown in two parts), which shows the candidates for [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] senate representation in the [[2016 Australian federal election|2016 federal election]].\n\n[[File:Victorian-senate-paper-folded-01.png|640x640px|thumb|center|Senate ballot paper used in Victoria for 2016]]\n\nTo vote correctly, electors must either:\n* Vote for at least six parties above the thick black line, by writing the numbers 1-6 in party boxes.

Once a candidate has been elected with votes reaching the quota amount, any votes they receive in addition to this may be distributed to other candidates as preferences.\n\nWith an odd number of seats in a half-Senate election (3 or 5), 50.1% of the vote wins a majority (2/3) or (3/5).\n\nWith an even number of seats in a half-Senate election (6), 57.1% of the vote is needed to win a majority of seats (4/6).\n\nThe ungrouped candidates in the far right column do not have a box above the line. Therefore, they can only get a primary (number 1) vote from electors who vote below the line.  For this reason, some independents register as a group, either with other independents or by themselves, such as group B in the above example.\n\nNames of parties can be shown only if the parties are registered, which requires, among other things, a minimum of 500 members.\n\n=== Order of parties ===\nThe order of parties on the ballot papers and the order of ungrouped candidates are determined by a random ballot conducted by the Electoral Commission.\n\n=== Deposit ===\nCandidates, parties and groups pay a deposit of $2000 per candidate, which is forfeited if they fail to achieve 4% of the primary vote.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.aec.gov.au/Elections/candidates/ |title=Candidate information |date=17 October 2019 |publisher=[[Australian Electoral Commission]] |accessdate=27 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Public subsidy ===\nCandidates, parties and groups earn a public subsidy if they gain at least 4% of the primary vote.

A [[1967 Australian referendum (Parliament)|referendum]] in 1967 to eliminate the nexus was rejected.\n\nThe size of the Senate has changed over the years. The Constitution originally provided for six senators for each state, resulting in a total of 36 senators.\n\nThe Constitution permits the Parliament to increase the number of senators, provided that equal numbers of senators from each original state are maintained; accordingly, in 1948, Senate representation was increased from 6 to 10 senators for each state, increasing the total to 60.\n\nIn 1975, the two territories, the [[Northern Territory]] and the [[Australian Capital Territory]], were given an entitlement to elect two senators each for the first time, bringing the number to 64.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/sota1973408/ |title=Senate (Representation of Territories) Act 1973.

Retrieved August 2007.</ref>\n\n===Term===\nSenators normally serve fixed six-year terms (from 1 July to 30 June). At most federal elections, the seats of 40 of the 76 Senators (half of the 72 Senators from the six states and all four of the Senators from the territories) are contested, along with the entire House of Representatives; such an election is sometimes known as a half-Senate election. The seats of Senators elected at a half-Senate election are not contested at the next election, provided it is a half-Senate election. However, under some circumstances, the entire Senate (and the House of Representatives) is dissolved early, in what is known as a [[double dissolution]]. Following a double dissolution, half the Senators representing states serve terms ending on the third 30 June following the election (two to three years) and the rest serve a five to six-year term. [[Section 13 of the Constitution of Australia#Allocation of terms|Section 13 of the Constitution]] requires the Senate to allocate long and short terms amongst its members. The term of Senators representing a territory expires at the same time as there is an election for the House of Representatives. While there is no constitutional requirement for the election of Senators to take place at the same time as those for members of the House of Representatives, the government usually synchronises the dates of elections for the Senate and House of Representatives.\n\nSection 13 of the Constitution requires that in half-Senate elections, the election of State senators shall take place within one year before the places become vacant. The actual election date is determined by the Governor of each State, who acts on the advice of the State Premier. The Governors almost always act on the recommendation of the Governor-General, with the last independent Senate election writ being issued by the Governor of Queensland during the [[Gair Affair]] in 1974.\n\nSlightly more than half of the Senate is contested at each general election (half of the 72 state senators, and all four of the territory senators), along with the entire House of Representatives. Except in the case of a [[double dissolution]], senators for the states are elected for fixed terms of six years, commencing on 1 July following the election, and ceasing on 30 June six years later.\n\nThe term of the four senators from the territories is not fixed, but is defined by the dates of the general elections for the House of Representatives, the period between which can vary greatly, to a maximum of three years and three months. Territory senators commence their terms on the day that they are elected. Their terms expire the day prior to the following general election day.<ref>[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/sota1973408/s6.html ''Section 6 of the Senate (Representation of Territories) Act 1973'']. Retrieved August 2010.</ref>\n\nWhile there is no constitutional requirement for the election of Senators to take place at the same time as those for members of the House of Representatives, the government usually synchronises the dates of elections for the Senate and House of Representatives. However, because their terms do not coincide, the incoming Parliament will for some time comprise the new House of Representatives and the old Senate, except for the senators representing the territories, until the new senators start their term on the next 1 July.\n\nFollowing a double dissolution, all 76 senators face re-election. If there is an early House election outside the 12-month period in which Senate elections can occur, the synchronisation of the election will be disrupted, and there can be half-Senate elections without a concurrent House election. The last time this occurred was on [[1970 Australian Senate election|21 November 1970]].\n\n===Quota Size===\nThe number of votes that a candidate must receive to be elected to the senate is referred to as a 'Quota'. The quota is worked out by dividing the number of formal votes by one more than the number of vacancies to be filled and then adding one to the result.<ref name = \"count\">https://aec.gov.au/Voting/counting/files/senate-count-process.pdf</ref> The 2019 senate election was a half senate election, so 6 senate vacancies were contested in each state. At this election, the quotas in each state were:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

[[Tasmania]], with a population of around 500,000, elects the same number of senators as [[New South Wales]], which has a population of over 7 million. Because of this imbalance, governments favoured by the more populous states are occasionally frustrated by the extra power the smaller states have in the Senate, to the degree that former Prime Minister [[Paul Keating]] famously referred to the Senate's members as \"unrepresentative swill\".<ref>[http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22chamber%2Fhansardr%2F1992-11-04%2F0030%22 Question without Notice: Loan Council Arrangements] House Hansard,</ref> The proportional election system within each state ensures that the Senate incorporates more political diversity than the lower house, which is basically a [[Two-party system|two party]] body.

When the Senate had an odd number of Senators retiring at an election (3 or 5), 51% of the vote would lead to a clear majority of 3 out of 5 per state. With an even number of Senators retiring at an election, it takes 57% of the vote to win 4 out of 6 seats, which may be insurmountable. This gives the House an unintended extra advantage in joint sittings but not in ordinary elections, where the Senate may be too evenly balanced to get House legislation through.\n\nThe Government does not need the support of the Senate to stay in office; however, the Senate can block or defer supply, an action that precipitated a [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|constitutional crisis in 1975]]. However, if the governing party does not have a majority in the Senate, it can often find its agenda frustrated in the upper house. This can be the case even when the government has a large majority in the House.\n\n===Parties===\nThe overwhelming majority of senators have always been elected as representatives of political parties. Parties which currently have representation in the Senate are:\n* [[Coalition (Australia)|The Coalition]] \u2013 [[Liberal Party of Australia]], [[National Party of Australia]]\n* [[Australian Labor Party]]\n* [[Australian Greens]]\n* [[Pauline Hanson's One Nation]]\n* [[Centre Alliance]]\n* [[Jacqui Lambie Network]]\n\nOther parties that have achieved Senate representation in the past include the [[Australian Conservatives]], [[United Australia Party (2013)|United Australia]], [[Derryn Hinch's Justice Party]], [[Family First Party]], [[Australian Democrats]], [[Palmer United Party]], [[Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party]], [[Nuclear Disarmament Party]], [[Liberal Movement (Australia)|Liberal Movement]], [[Liberal Democratic Party (Australia)|Liberal Democratic Party]], the [[Democratic Labour Party (Australia)|Democratic Labour Party]] and the related but separate [[Democratic Labor Party (historical)|Democratic Labor Party]].\n\nDue to the need to obtain votes statewide, [[Independent politicians in Australia|independent candidates]] have difficulty getting elected. The exceptions in recent times have been elected in less populous States\u2014the former Tasmanian Senator [[Brian Harradine]] and the former South Australian Senator [[Nick Xenophon]]. It is less uncommon for a senator initially elected representing a party to become an independent, most recently in the cases of Senator [[Lucy Gichuhi]] resigning from Family First, Senators [[Rod Culleton]] and [[Fraser Anning]] resigning from One Nation, and Senator [[Steve Martin (Australian politician)|Steve Martin]] being expelled from the Jacqui Lambie Network.\n\nThe Australian Senate serves as a model for some politicians in Canada, particularly in the Western provinces, who wish to reform the [[Senate of Canada|Canadian Senate]] so that it takes a more active legislative role.<ref>Ted Morton, [http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Research_and_Education/pops/pop39/morton 'Senate Envy: Why Western Canada Wants What Australia Has'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514175438/http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Research_and_Education/pops/pop39/morton |date=14 May 2013 }}, ''Senate Envy and Other Lectures in the Senate Occasional Lecture Series, 2001\u20132002'', Department of the Senate, Canberra.</ref>\n\nThere are also small factions in the United Kingdom (both from the right and left) who wish to the see the House of Lords take on a structure similar to that of the Australian Senate.<ref>{{cite book| last = Renwick| first = Alan| authorlink =| title = House of Lords Reform: A Briefing Paper | publisher = Political Studies Association| year = 2011| url = https://www.psa.ac.uk/sites/default/files/HL%20Reform%20briefing%20paper.pdf| isbn = }}</ref>\n\n===Casual vacancies===\n{{see also|Casual vacancies in the Australian Parliament|List of Australian Senate appointments}}\nSection 15 of the Constitution provides that a [[Casual vacancies in the Australian Parliament|casual vacancy]] of a State senator shall be filled by the State Parliament. If the previous senator was a member of a particular political party the replacement must come from the same party, but the State Parliament may choose not to fill the vacancy, in which case Section 11 requires the Senate to proceed regardless. If the State Parliament happens to be in recess when the vacancy occurs, the Constitution provides that the State Governor can appoint someone to fill the place until fourteen days after the State Parliament resumes sitting.\n\n== Procedure ==\n[[File:Senate panorama.jpg|thumb|400px|The Australian Senate]]\n\n=== Work ===\nThe Australian Senate typically sits for 50 to 60 days a year.{{efn|Figures are available for each year on the Senate StatsNet.}} Most of those days are grouped into 'sitting fortnights' of two four-day weeks. These are in turn arranged in three periods: the autumn sittings, from February to April; the winter sittings, which commence with the delivery of the budget in the House of Representatives on the first sitting day of May and run through to June or July; and the spring sittings, which commence around August and continue until December, and which typically contain the largest number of the year's sitting days.\n\nThe senate has a regular schedule that structures its typical working week.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/work/routineofbus.htm |title=Senate weekly routine of business |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=7 November 2011 |publisher=Australian Senate |access-date= |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126125039/http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/work/routineofbus.htm |archive-date=26 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n====Dealing with legislation====\nAll [[bill (law)|bills]] must be passed by a majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate before they become law. Most bills originate in the House of Representatives, and the great majority are introduced by the government.\n\nThe usual procedure is for notice to be given by a government minister the day before the bill is introduced into the Senate. Once introduced the bill goes through several stages of consideration. It is given a [[reading (legislature)|first reading]], which represents the bill's formal introduction into the chamber.\n\n<blockquote>The first reading is followed by debate on the principle or policy of the bill (the second reading debate). Agreement to the bill in principle is indicated by a second reading, after which the detailed provisions of the bill are considered by one of a number of methods (see below). Bills may also be referred by either House to their specialised standing or select committees. Agreement to the policy and the details is confirmed by a third and final reading. These processes ensure that a bill is systematically considered before being agreed to.<ref>Australian Senate, [http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/pubs/briefs/brief08.htm 'The Senate and Legislation'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924114919/http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/pubs/briefs/brief08.htm |date=24 September 2008 }}, ''Senate Brief'', No. 8, 2008, Department of the Senate, Canberra.</ref></blockquote>\nThe Senate has detailed rules in its standing orders that govern how a bill is considered at each stage.<ref>Australian Senate, [http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/pubs/guides/briefno09.htm 'Consideration of legislation'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926083250/http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/pubs/guides/briefno09.htm |date=26 September 2008 }}, ''Brief Guides to Senate Procedure'', No. 9, Department of the Senate, Canberra.</ref> This process of consideration can vary greatly in the amount of time taken. Consideration of some bills is completed in a single day, while complex or controversial legislation may take months to pass through all stages of Senate scrutiny. The Constitution provides that if the Senate vote is equal, the question shall pass in the negative.\n\n====Committees====\n{{Main|Australian Senate committees}}\n[[Image:AustralianSenateCommitteeRm.JPG|thumb|alt=A meeting room containing a large horseshoe-shaped desk, with red leather office chairs surrounding its outside edge, a microphone mounted in the desk in front of each chair|A Senate committee room in Parliament House, Canberra]]\n[[File:Australian Parliament Parliamentary Committees.webm|thumb|left|A short video on Australian Parliamentary Committees]]\nIn addition to the work of the main chamber, the Senate also has a large number of [[Australian Senate committees|committees]] which deal with matters referred to them by the Senate. These committees also conduct hearings three times a year in which the government's budget and operations are examined. These are known as estimates hearings. Traditionally dominated by scrutiny of government activities by non-government senators, they provide the opportunity for all senators to ask questions of ministers and public officials. This may occasionally include government senators examining activities of independent publicly funded bodies, or pursuing issues arising from previous governments' terms of office. There is however a convention that senators do not have access to the files and records of previous governments when there has been an election resulting in a change in the party in government. Once a particular inquiry is completed the members of the committee can then produce a report, to be tabled in Parliament, outlining what they have discovered as well as any recommendations that they have produced for the Government to consider.<ref name = \"odgcom\">{{cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/Odgers_Australian_Senate_Practice/Chapter_16 |title=Odgers' Australian Senate Practice Fourteenth Edition Chapter 16 - Committees|date=2017 |accessdate=19 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe ability of the Houses of Parliament to establish committees is referenced in Section 49 of the Constitution, which states that, \"''The powers, privileges, and immunities of the Senate and of the House of Representatives, and of the members and the committees of each House, shall be such as are declared by the Parliament, and until declared shall be those of the Commons House of Parliament of the United Kingdom, and of its members and committees, at the establishment of the Commonwealth.''\"<ref name=\"con49\">[[Constitution of Australia]], section 49.</ref><ref name = \"odgcom\"/>\n\nParliamentary committees can be given a wide range of powers. One of the most significant powers is the ability to summon people to attend hearings in order to give evidence and submit documents. Anyone who attempts to hinder the work of a Parliamentary committee may be found to be in [[contempt of Parliament]]. There are a number of ways that witnesses can be found in contempt, these include; refusing to appear before a committee when summoned, refusing to answer a question during a hearing or to produce a document, or later being found to have lied to or misled a committee. Anyone who attempts to influence a witness may also be found in contempt.<ref name=\"com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/Powers_practice_and_procedure/00_-_Infosheets/Infosheet_4_-_Committees |title=Infosheet 4 - Committees |publisher=aph.gov.au |date= |accessdate=22 February 2017}}</ref> Other powers include the ability to meet throughout Australia, to establish subcommittees and to take evidence in both public and private hearings.<ref name = \"odgcom\"/>\n\nProceedings of committees are considered to have the same legal standing as proceedings of Parliament. They are recorded by [[Hansard]], except for private hearings, and also operate under [[Parliamentary privilege]]. Every participant, including committee members and witnesses giving evidence, is protected from being prosecuted under any civil or criminal action for anything they may say during a hearing. Written evidence and documents received by a committee are also protected.<ref name=\"com\"/><ref name = \"odgcom\"/>\n\n====Holding governments to account====\nOne of the functions of the Senate, both directly and through its [[Australian Senate committees|committees]], is to scrutinise government activity. The vigour of this scrutiny has been fuelled for many years by the fact that the party in government has seldom had a majority in the Senate. Whereas in the House of Representatives the government's majority has sometimes limited that chamber's capacity to implement executive scrutiny, the opposition and minor parties have been able to use their Senate numbers as a basis for conducting inquiries into government operations. When the [[Howard Government]] won control of the Senate in 2005, it sparked a debate about the effectiveness of the Senate in holding the government of the day accountable for its actions. Government members argued that the Senate continued to be a forum of vigorous debate, and its committees continued to be active.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.financeminister.gov.au/media/2006/mr_432006.html |title=Media Release 43/2006 \u2013 Senate remains robust under Government majority |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=30 June 2006 |website= |publisher= |access-date= |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927145249/http://www.financeminister.gov.au/media/2006/mr_432006.html |archive-date=27 September 2007}}</ref> The Opposition leader in the Senate suggested that the government had attenuated the scrutinising activities of the Senate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chrisevans.alp.org.au/news/1105/senatespeeches10-01.php |title=Senator Chris Evans, The tyranny of the majority (speech) |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=10 November 2005 |website= |publisher= |access-date= |quote=\"Labor has accused the Government of 'ramming' bills through the Senate \u2013 but Labor \"guillotined\" Parliamentary debate more than twice the number of times in their 13 years in Government than the Coalition has over the last decade.

These votes are called ''divisions'' in the case of Senate business, or ''ballots'' where the vote is to choose a senator to fill an office of the Senate (such as the [[President of the Senate (Australia)|President]]).<ref>''Senate Standing Orders'', numbers 7, 10, 98\u2013105, 163</ref>\n\nParty discipline in [[Politics of Australia|Australian politics]] is extremely tight, so divisions almost always are decided on party lines. Nevertheless, the existence of minor parties holding the balance of power in the Senate has made divisions in that chamber more important and occasionally more dramatic than in the House of Representatives.\n\nWhen a division is to be held, bells ring throughout the parliament building for four minutes, during which time senators must go to the chamber. At the end of that period the doors are locked and a vote is taken, by identifying and counting senators according to the side of the chamber on which they sit (ayes to the right of the chair, noes to the left). The whole procedure takes around eight minutes. Senators with commitments that keep them from the chamber may make arrangements in advance to be 'paired' with a senator of the opposite political party, so that their absence does not affect the outcome of the vote.\n\nThe Senate contains an even number of senators, so a tied vote is a real prospect (which regularly occurs when the party numbers in the chamber are finely balanced). [[Section 23 of the Constitution of Australia|Section 23 of the Constitution]] requires that in the event of a tied division, the question is resolved in the negative. The system is however different for ballots for offices such as the President. If such a ballot is tied, the [[Clerk of the Australian Senate|Clerk of the Senate]] decides the outcome by the drawing of lots. In reality, conventions govern most ballots, so this situation does not arise.\n\n====Political parties and voting outcomes====\nThe extent to which party discipline determines the outcome of parliamentary votes is highlighted by the rarity with which members of the same political party will find themselves on opposing sides of a vote. The exceptions are where a [[conscience vote]] is allowed by one or more of the political parties; and occasions where a member of a political party [[crossing the floor|crosses the floor]] of the chamber to vote against the instructions of their [[whip (politics)|party whip]]. Crossing the floor very rarely occurs, but is more likely in the Senate than in the House of Representatives.<ref>Deirdre McKeown, Rob Lundie and Greg Baker, [http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/rn/2005-06/06rn11.pdf 'Crossing the floor in the Federal Parliament 1950 \u2013 August 2004'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003132418/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/rn/2005-06/06rn11.pdf |date=3 October 2008 }}, ''Research Note'', No. 11, 2005\u201306, Department of Parliamentary Services, Canberra.</ref>\n\nOne feature of the government having a majority in both chambers between 1 July 2005 and the 2007 elections was the potential for an increased emphasis on internal differences between members of the government coalition parties.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://democratic.audit.anu.edu.au/papers/20050630_uhr.pdf |title=How Democratic is Parliament?

In such an event, the entirety of the Senate faces re-election, as does the House of Representatives, rather than only about half the chamber as is normally the case. After a double dissolution election, if the bills in question are reintroduced, and if they again fail to pass the Senate, the Governor-General may agree to a ''joint sitting'' of the two Houses in an attempt to pass the bills. [[Joint Sitting of the Australian Parliament of 1974|Such a sitting]] has only occurred once, in 1974.\n\nThe double dissolution mechanism is not available for bills that originate in the Senate and are blocked in the lower house.\n\nAfter a double dissolution election, section 13 of the Constitution requires the Senate to divide the senators into two classes, with the first class having a three-year \"short term\", and the second class a six-year \"long term\". The Senate may adopt any approach it wants to determine how to allocate the long and short terms, however two methods are currently 'on the table':\n* \"elected-order\" method, where the Senators elected first attain a six-year term.

Under a traditional Westminster system, the [[executive (government)|executive]] government is responsible for its use of public funds to the lower house, which has the power to bring down a government by [[Loss of supply|blocking its access to supply]]&nbsp;\u2013 i.e. [[revenue]] appropriated through taxation. The arrangement as expressed in the Australian Constitution, however, still leaves the Senate with the power to reject supply bills or defer their passage&nbsp;\u2013 undoubtedly one of the Senate's most powerful abilities.\n\nThe ability to block supply was exercised in the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis]]. The [[Opposition (Australia)|Opposition]] used its numbers in the Senate to defer supply bills, refusing to deal with them until an election was called for both Houses of Parliament, an election which it hoped to win. The [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] of the day, [[Gough Whitlam]], contested the legitimacy of the blocking and refused to resign. The crisis brought to a head two Westminster conventions that, under the Australian constitutional system, were in conflict&nbsp;\u2013 firstly, that a government may continue to govern for as long as it has the support of the [[lower house]], and secondly, that a government that no longer has access to supply must either resign or be dismissed.

Electronica Allah''' (born September 19, 1976), known professionally as '''Jay Electronica''', is an American [[rapper]], [[record producer]], and [[songwriter]] from [[New Orleans|New Orleans, Louisiana]].\n\n==Early life==\nInspired by [[LL Cool J]], Jay Electronica began rapping at the age of 10. He grew up in the [[Magnolia Projects]] in [[New Orleans]] and attended the all-boys parochial high school [[St. Augustine High School (New Orleans)|St. Augustine High School]] and was a part of the famed Marching 100 band where he played multiple instruments.<ref>https://www.spin.com/2010/06/jay-electronica-man-or-myth/</ref>\n\nElectronica left New Orleans on January 1, 1996 with the intention of moving to [[New York City]] but took a stop in [[Atlanta]]. Electronica was struck by \"all the now hiring signs because of the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Olympics]],\" there he accepted the teachings of [[Elijah Muhammad]] via the [[Five-Percent Nation]] before moving on to becoming a registered member of the [[Nation of Islam]] at its headquarters in [[Chicago]].\n\n==Career==\nJay Electronica released his first mixtape [[Act I: Eternal Sunshine (The Pledge)]] via MySpace.

Germanic tribe...\"{{sfn|Howatson|2011}} }} people who along with the [[Ostrogoths]] constituted the two major branches of the [[Goths]].{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=843}} These tribes flourished and spread throughout the late [[Roman Empire]] in [[Late Antiquity]], or what is known as the [[Migration Period]]. The Visigoths emerged from earlier Gothic groups, the [[Thervingi]], who had moved into the Roman Empire beginning in 376 and had defeated the Romans at the [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378.{{sfn|Heather|1998|pp=52\u201357, 300\u2013301}} Relations between the Romans and the Visigoths were variable, alternately warring with one another and making treaties when convenient.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=843}} The Visigoths under [[Alaric I]] invaded Italy and [[sack of Rome (410)|sacked Rome in 410]]. After the Visigoths sacked Rome, they began settling down, first in southern [[Gaul]] and eventually in [[Hispania]], where they founded the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] and maintained a presence from the 5th to the 8th centuries AD.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|pp=843\u2013844}}\n\nThe Visigoths first settled in southern Gaul as ''[[foederati]]'' to the Romans \u2013 a relationship established in 418. However, they soon fell out with their Roman hosts (for reasons that are now obscure) and established their own kingdom with its [[Capital city|capital]] at [[Toulouse]]. They next extended their authority into [[Hispania]] at the expense of the [[Suebi]] and [[Vandals]]. In 507, however, their rule in Gaul was ended by the [[Franks]] under [[Clovis I]], who defeated them in the [[Battle of Vouill\u00e9]]. After that, the Visigoth kingdom was limited to [[Hispania]], and they never again held territory north of the [[Pyrenees]] other than [[Septimania]]. A small, elite group of Visigoths came to dominate the governance of that region at the expense of those who had previously ruled there, particularly in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] province of [[Spania]] and the [[Kingdom of the Suebi]].\n\nIn or around 589, the Visigoths under [[Reccared I]] converted from [[Arianism]] to [[Nicene Christianity]], gradually adopting the culture of their Hispano-Roman subjects.{{sfn|Claude|1998|pp=119\u2013120}} Their legal code, the ''[[Visigothic Code]]'' (completed in 654) abolished the longstanding practice of applying different laws for Romans and Visigoths. Once legal distinctions were no longer being made between ''Romani'' and ''Gothi'', they became known collectively as ''Hispani''. In the century that followed, the region was dominated by the [[Councils of Toledo]] and the episcopacy. Little else is known about the Visigoths' history during the 7th century, since records are relatively sparse. In 711 or 712, an [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|invading force of Arabs and Berbers]] defeated the Visigoths in the [[Battle of Guadalete]]. Their king, [[Roderic]], and many members of their governing elite were killed, and their kingdom rapidly collapsed.\n\nDuring their governance of [[Hispania]], the Visigoths [[Visigothic art and architecture|built several churches]] that survive. They also left many artifacts, which have been discovered in increasing numbers by archaeologists in recent times. The [[Treasure of Guarrazar]] of [[votive crown]]s and crosses is the most spectacular. They founded the only new cities in western Europe from the fall of the Western half of the Roman Empire until the rise of the [[Carolingian dynasty]]. Many Visigothic names are still in use in modern [[List of Spanish words of Germanic origin#Names|Spanish]] and [[List of Portuguese words of Germanic origin#Names|Portuguese]]. Their most notable legacy, however, was the ''[[Visigothic Code]]'', which served, among other things, as the basis for court procedure in most of Christian [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] until the [[Late Middle Ages]], centuries after the demise of the kingdom.\n\n==Nomenclature: Vesi, Ostrogothi, Tervingi, Greuthungi==\n\nAmong the first references to Gothic tribes by Roman and Greek authors in the 4th century, appear the \"Vesi\", from which the name \"Visigoths\" derives, along with (among others), the \"[[Ostrogoths|Ostrogothi]]\", \"[[Thervingi]]\", and \"[[Greuthungi]]\". Based upon the medieval writer [[Jordanes]], whose work concerning the origins of the Goths is unreliable for many facts, scholars traditionally treated the terms \"Vesi\" and \"Tervingi\" as referring to one particular tribe, while the terms \"Ostrogothi\" and \"Greuthungi\" were used to refer to another. More specifically, Jordanes identified the Visigoth (Vesi) kings from [[Alaric I]] to [[Alaric II]] as the successors of the 4th century Tervingian king [[Athanaric]], and the Ostrogoth kings from [[Theoderic the Great]] to [[Theodahad]] as the heirs of the Greuthungi king [[Ermanaric]].{{sfn|Heather|1998|pp=300\u2013301}}\n\n[[Herwig Wolfram]], a scholar who still recently defends the equation of Vesi with the Tervingi, argues that while primary sources occasionally list all four names (as in, for example, ''Gruthungi, Austrogothi, Tervingi, Visi''), whenever they mention two different tribes, they always refer either to \"the Vesi and the Ostrogothi\" or to \"the Tervingi and the Greuthungi\", and they never pair them up in any other combination. In addition, Wolfram interprets the ''[[Notitia Dignitatum]]'' as equating the Vesi with the Tervingi in a reference to the years 388\u2013391.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=24-25}} On the other hand, another other recent interpretation of the ''Notitia'' is that the two names, Vesi and Tervingi, are found in different places in the list, \"a clear indication that we are dealing with two different army units, which must also presumably mean that they are, after all, perceived as two different peoples\".{{sfn|Christensen|2002|p=219}} Peter Heather has written that Wolfram's position is \"entirely arguable, but so is the opposite\".{{sfn|Heather|1999|p=75}}\n\n[[File:Gutthiuda.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|right|Gutthiuda{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}]]\n\nWolfram believes that \"Vesi\" and \"Ostrogothi\" were terms each tribe used to boastfully describe itself and argues that \"Tervingi\" and \"Greuthungi\" were geographical identifiers each tribe used to describe the other.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} This would explain why the latter terms dropped out of use shortly after 400, when the Goths were displaced by the [[Huns#Before Attila|Hunnic invasions]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=24}} Wolfram believes that the people Zosimus describes were those Tervingi who had remained behind after the Hunnic conquest.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=387, fn57}} For the most part, all of the terms discriminating between different Gothic tribes gradually disappeared after they moved into the Roman Empire.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} \n\nMany recent scholars, such as [[Peter Heather]], have concluded that Visigothic group identity emerged only within the Roman Empire.{{sfn|Heather|1998|pp=52\u201357, 130\u2013178, 302\u2013309}} [[Roger Collins]] also believes that the Visigothic identity emerged from the [[Gothic War (376\u2013382)|Gothic War of 376\u2013382]] when a collection of Tervingi, Greuthungi, and other \"barbarian\" contingents banded together in multiethnic ''[[foederati]]'' (Wolfram's \"federate armies\") under Alaric I in the eastern [[Balkans]], since they had become a multi ethnic group and could no longer claim to be exclusively Tervingian.{{sfn|Collins|2004|pp=22\u201324}}\n\nIn 456 and 458, the poet [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] used the old term Vesi to refer to the Visigoths in Gaul.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|p=219}}{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}}\n\nThe term \"Visigoth\" itself, based upon the older \"Vesi\", is first found in 507 in what is now France. [[Cassiodorus]], a Roman in the service of Theodoric the Great, invented the term \"Visigothic\" to match that of \"Ostrogothic\", terms he thought of as signifying \"western Goths\" and \"eastern Goths\" respectively.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} The western\u2013eastern division was a simplification (and a literary device) of 6th century historians; political realities were more complex.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} Further, Cassiodorus used the term \"Goths\" to refer only to the Ostrogoths, whom he served, and reserved the geographical term \"Visigoths\" for the Gallo-Spanish Goths.

In 469, the Visigoths were called the \"Alaric Goths\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} The [[Frankish Table of Nations]], probably of Byzantine or Italian origin, referred to one of the two peoples as the ''Walagothi'', meaning \"Roman Goths\" (from Germanic *''[[walhaz]]'', foreign).

Eventually the Gothic language died as a result of contact with other European people during the [[Middle Ages]].{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=844}}\n\nLong struggles between the neighboring Vandili and Lugii people with the Goths may have contributed to their earlier exodus into mainland Europe. The vast majority of them settled between the [[Oder]] and [[Vistula]] rivers until overpopulation (according to Gothic legends or tribal sagas) forced them to move south and east, where they settled just north of the [[Black Sea]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=42\u201343}} However, this legend is not supported by archaeological evidence so its validity is disputable. Historian Malcolm Todd contends that while this large ''en masse'' migration is possible, the movement of Gothic peoples south-east was more likely the result of warrior bands moving closer to the wealth of [[Ukraine]] and the cities of the Black Sea coast. Perhaps what is most notable about the Gothic people in this regard was that by the middle of the 3rd century AD, they were \"the most formidable military power beyond the lower Danube frontier\".{{sfn|Todd|2000|pp=149\u2013150}}{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=42\u201355}}\n\n====Contact with Rome====\n[[File:Tezaurul de la Pietroasele Closca MNIR Tezaur.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Pietroasele Treasure]] discovered in Romania, attributed to the Visigoths{{sfn|Odobescu|1889|p=1-100}}]]\nThroughout the third and fourth centuries there were numerous conflicts and exchanges of varying types between the Goths and their neighbors. After the Romans withdrew from the territory of Dacia, the local population was subjected to constant invasions by the migratory tribes, among the first being the Goths.{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|p=11}} In 238, the Goths invaded across the Danube into the Roman province of [[Moesia]], pillaging and exacting payment through hostage taking. During the war with the Persians that year, Goths also appeared in the Roman armies of [[Gordian III]].{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=150}} When subsidies to the Goths were stopped, the Goths organized and in 250 joined a major barbarian invasion led by the Germanic king, Kniva.{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=150}} Success on the battlefield against the Romans inspired additional invasions into the northern [[Balkans]] and deeper into [[Anatolia]].{{sfn|Todd|2000|pp=150\u2013151}} Starting in approximately 255, the Goths added a new dimension to their attacks by taking to the sea and invading harbors which brought them into conflict with the Greeks as well. When the city of [[Pityus]] fell to the Goths in 256, the Goths were further emboldened. Sometime between 266\u2013267, the Goths raided Greece but when they attempted to move into the Bosporus straits to attack Byzantium, they were repulsed. Along with other Germanic tribes, they attacked further into Anatolia, assaulting Crete and Cyprus on the way; shortly thereafter, they pillaged Troy and the temple of Artemis at Ephesus.{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=151}} Throughout the reign of emperor [[Constantine the Great]], the Visigoths continued to conduct raids on Roman territory south of the Danube River.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=844}} By 332, relations between the Goths and Romans were stabilized by a treaty but this was not to last.{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=152}}\n\n===War with Rome (376\u2013382)===\n{{Main|Gothic War (376\u2013382)}}\nThe Goths remained in [[Dacia]] until 376, when one of their leaders, [[Fritigern]], appealed to the Roman emperor [[Valens]] to be allowed to settle with his people on the south bank of the [[Danube River|Danube]]. Here, they hoped to find refuge from the [[Huns]].{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|pp=844\u2013845}} Valens permitted this, as he saw in them \"a splendid recruiting ground for his army\".{{sfn|Fuller|1998|p=55}} However, a [[famine]] broke out and Rome was unwilling to supply them with either the food they were promised or the land. Generally, the Goths were abused by the Romans,{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=845}} who began forcing the now starving Goths to trade away their children so as to stave off starvation.{{sfn|Durant|1950|p=24}} Open revolt ensued, leading to 6 years of plundering throughout the Balkans, the death of a Roman Emperor and a disastrous defeat of the Roman army.{{sfn|Durant|1950|pp=24\u201325}}\n\nThe [[Battle of Adrianople (378)|Battle of Adrianople]] in 378 was the decisive moment of the war.

Fourth-century Roman soldier and historian [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] ended his chronology of Roman history with this battle.{{sfn|Katz|1955|pp=88\u201389}}\n\nDespite the severe consequences for Rome, Adrianople was not nearly as productive overall for the Visigoths and their gains were short-lived. Still confined to a small and relatively impoverished province of the Empire, another Roman army was being gathered against them, an army which also had amid its ranks other disaffected Goths.{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=154}} Intense campaigns against the Visigoths followed their victory at Adrianople for upwards of three years. Approach routes across the Danube provinces were effectively sealed off by concerted Roman efforts, and while there was no decisive victory to claim, it was essentially a Roman triumph ending in a treaty in 382. The treaty struck with the Goths was to be the first ''foedus'' on imperial Roman soil. It required these semi-autonomous Germanic tribes to raise troops for the Roman army in exchange for arable land and freedom from Roman legal structures within the Empire.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=179\u2013180}}{{Efn|Other sources dispute the contents of the supposed \"treaty\" and claim it was a Gothic surrender.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=180\u2013181}} }}\n\n===Reign of Alaric I===\n[[File:Alaric entering Athens.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|right|An illustration of [[Alaric I|Alaric]] entering [[Athens]] in 395]]\n{{Main|Alaric I}}\nThe new emperor, [[Theodosius I]], made peace with the rebels, and this peace held essentially unbroken until Theodosius died in 395.{{sfn|Burns|2003|pp=322, 374}} In that year, the Visigoths' most famous king, [[Alaric I]], made a bid for the throne, but controversy and intrigue erupted between the East and West, as General [[Stilicho]] tried to maintain his position in the empire.{{sfn|Heather|2013|pp=153\u2013160}} Theodosius was succeeded by his incompetent sons: [[Arcadius]] in the east and [[Flavius Augustus Honorius|Honorius]] in the west. In 397, Alaric was named military commander of the eastern Illyrian prefecture by Arcadius.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=845}}\n\nOver the next 15 years, an uneasy peace was broken by occasional conflicts between Alaric and the powerful Germanic generals who commanded the Roman armies in the east and west, wielding the real power of the empire.{{sfn|Heather|2013|pp=183\u2013223}} Finally, after the western general Stilicho was executed by Honorius in 408 and the Roman legions massacred the families of thousands of barbarian soldiers who were trying to assimilate into the Roman empire, Alaric decided to march on Rome.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|pp=204\u2013205}} After two defeats in Northern Italy and a siege of Rome ended by a negotiated pay-off, Alaric was cheated by another Roman faction. He resolved to cut the city off by capturing its port. On August 24, 410, however, Alaric's troops entered Rome through the [[Salarian Gate]], and [[sack of Rome (410)|sacked the city]].{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=214\u2013217}} However, Rome, while still the official capital, was no longer the ''de facto'' seat of the government of the Western Roman Empire. From the late 370s up to 402, [[Milan]] was the seat of government, but after the siege of Milan the Imperial Court moved to [[Ravenna]] in 402. Honorius visited Rome often, and after his death in 423 the emperors resided mostly there. Rome's fall severely shook the Empire's confidence, especially in the West. Loaded with booty, Alaric and the Visigoths extracted as much as they could with the intention of leaving Italy from Basilicata to northern [[Africa]]. Alaric died before the disembarkation and was buried supposedly near the ruins of Croton. He was succeeded by his wife's brother.{{sfn|Collins|1999|pp=63\u201365}}\n\n===Visigothic Kingdom===\n{{Main|Visigothic Kingdom}}\n[[File:Europe and the Near East at 476 AD.png|thumb|upright=1.6|Europe at the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD]]\n\nThe Visigothic Kingdom was a Western European power in the 5th to 7th centuries, created in Gaul when the Romans lost their control of the western half of their empire. For a brief period, the Visigoths controlled the strongest kingdom in Western Europe.{{sfn|Williams|2004|p=51}} In response to the invasion of [[Hispania|Roman Hispania]] of 409 by the [[Vandals]], [[Alans]] and [[Suebi]], [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]], the emperor in the West, enlisted the aid of the Visigoths to regain control of the territory. From 408 to 410 the Visigoths caused so much damage to Rome and the immediate periphery that nearly a decade later, the provinces in and around the city were only able to contribute one-seventh of their previous tax shares.{{sfn|Heather|2005|p=434}}\n\nIn 418, Honorius rewarded his Visigothic [[foederati|federates]] by giving them land in [[Gallia Aquitania]] on which to settle after they had attacked the four tribes \u2013 Sueves, Asding and Siling Vandala and Alans \u2013 who had crossed the Rhine near Mainz the last day of 409 and eventually were invited into Spain by a Roman usurper in the Fall of 409 (the latter two tribes were devastated). This was probably done under ''hospitalitas'', the rules for billeting army soldiers.{{sfn|Sivan|1987|pp=759\u2013772}} The settlement formed the nucleus of the future Visigothic kingdom that would eventually expand across the [[Pyrenees]] and onto the Iberian peninsula. That Visigothic settlement proved paramount to Europe's future as had it not been for the Visigothic warriors who fought side-by-side with the Roman troops under general [[Flavius Aetius]], it is perhaps possible that [[Attila]] would have seized control of Gaul, rather than the Romans being able to retain dominance.{{sfn|Burns|2003|p=382}}\n\nThe Visigoths' second great king, [[Euric]], unified the various quarreling factions among the Visigoths and, in 475, forced the Roman government to come to terms, but the emperor did not legally recognize Gothic sovereignty; instead the emperor was content to be called a friend (''amicus'') to the Visigoths, while requiring them to address him as lord (''dominus'').{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=186\u2013187}} Between 471\u2013476, Euric captured most of southern Gaul.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|p=358}} According to historian J.

There were also deep sectarian splits among the Catholic population of the peninsula which contributed to the toleration of the Arian Visigoths on the peninsula. The Visigoths scorned to interfere among Catholics but were interested in decorum and public order.{{Efn|At least one high-ranking Visigoth, [[Zerezindo]], ''dux'' of Baetica, was a Catholic in the mid-6th century.}} King [[Liuvigild]] (568\u2013586), attempted to restore political unity between the Visigothic-Arian elite and the Hispano-Roman Nicene Catholic population through a doctrinal settlement of compromise on matters of faith, but this failed.{{sfn|Heather|2013|p=325}} Sources indicate that the Iberian Visigoths maintained their Christian Arianism, especially the Visigothic elite until the end of Liuvigild's reign.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|pp=265\u2013269}} When Reccared I converted to Catholicism, he sought to unify the kingdom under a single faith.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|p=304}}{{sfn|Mathisen|Sivan|1999|p=40}}\n\n[[File:Wisi San Pedro de la Nave e chapiteau a.jpg|thumb|left|Capital from the Visigothic church of [[San Pedro de la Nave]], [[province of Zamora]]]]\n\nWhen the Visigoths took over Spain, [[Jews]] constituted a large and ancient proportion of the population. Many were farmers, but they worked in a wide range of occupations, and were a major component of the urbanized population of the larger towns particularly of eastern Spain. During the period in which the Visigoths adhered to Arianism, the situation of the Jews seems to have remained relatively good.  Previous Roman and Byzantine law determined their status, and it already sharply discriminated against them, but royal jurisdiction was in any case quite limited: local lords and populations related to Jews as they saw fit. We read of rabbis being asked by non-Jews to bless their fields, for example.{{sfn|Graetz|1894|p=44}} Historian Jane Gerber relates that some of the Jews \"held ranking posts in the government or the army; others were recruited and organized for garrison service; still others continued to hold senatorial rank\".{{sfn|Gerber|1992|p=9}} In general, then, they were well respected and well-treated by the Visigothic kings, that is, until their transition from Arianism to Catholicism.{{sfn|Roth|1994|pp=35\u201340}}\n\nCatholic conversion across Visigothic society reduced much of the friction between their people and the native Spanish population.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=847}} One chief purpose of this conversion was to unify the realm under the Church, and one of the key complaints of the Church had long been that Jews had too much status, prosperity and influence. Local nobles relied on their Jewish and non-Jewish sectors of the population to enhance the local economy and the noble's independent power. Visigothic political structure had traditionally given extensive powers to local nobles (who even elected their kings), so the king was in many ways merely 'the first amongst equals,' and central authority was weak. The status of the Jews therefore impacted local aristocrats both symbolically and politically.\n\nKing Reccared convened the Third Council of Toledo to settle religious disputations related to the religious conversion from Arianism to Catholicism.{{sfn|Collins|1999|pp=211\u2013212}} The discriminatory laws passed at this Council seem not to have been universally enforced, however, as indicated by several more Councils of Toledo that repeated these laws and extended their stringency.  These entered canon law and became legal precedents in other parts of Europe as well.  The culmination of this process occurred under King Sisibut, who decreed a forced Christian conversion upon all Jews in Spain.{{sfn|Collins|2000|p=60}} This mandate apparently achieved only partial success: similar decrees were repeated by later kings as central power was consolidated. These laws either prescribed forcible baptism of the Jews or forbade circumcision, Jewish rites, and the observance of the Sabbath and other festivals. Throughout the seventh century, Jews were flogged, executed, had their property confiscated, were subjected to ruinous taxes, forbidden to trade and, at times, dragged to the baptismal font. Many were obliged to accept Christianity but continued privately to observe the Jewish religion and practices.{{sfn|Gonzalez-Salinero|1999|pp=140\u2013147}} The decree of 613 set off a century of torment for Spanish Jewry, which was only ended by the Muslim conquest.{{Efn|Cf. the extensive accounts of Visigothic Jewish history by Heinrich Graetz, ''History of the Jews'', Vol. 3 (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1956 reprint [1894]), pp. 43\u201352 (on Sisibut, pp. 47\u201349); Salo W.

With the conversion of the Visigothic kings to [[Chalcedonian Christianity]], the bishops increased their power, until, at the [[Fourth Council of Toledo]] in 633, they selected a king from among the royal family, a practice previously reserved for nobles. This was the same synod that declared that all Jews must be [[baptism|baptised]].

Germanic tribe...\"{{sfn|Howatson|2011}} }} people who along with the [[Ostrogoths]] constituted the two major branches of the [[Goths]].{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=843}} These tribes flourished and spread throughout the late [[Roman Empire]] in [[Late Antiquity]], or what is known as the [[Migration Period]]. The Visigoths emerged from earlier Gothic groups, the [[Thervingi]], who had moved into the Roman Empire beginning in 376 and had defeated the Romans at the [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378.{{sfn|Heather|1998|pp=52\u201357, 300\u2013301}} Relations between the Romans and the Visigoths were variable, alternately warring with one another and making treaties when convenient.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=843}} The Visigoths under [[Alaric I]] invaded Italy and [[sack of Rome (410)|sacked Rome in 410]]. After the Visigoths sacked Rome, they began settling down, first in southern [[Gaul]] and eventually in [[Hispania]], where they founded the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] and maintained a presence from the 5th to the 8th centuries AD.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|pp=843\u2013844}}\n\nThe Visigoths first settled in southern Gaul as ''[[foederati]]'' to the Romans \u2013 a relationship established in 418. However, they soon fell out with their Roman hosts (for reasons that are now obscure) and established their own kingdom with its [[Capital city|capital]] at [[Toulouse]]. They next extended their authority into [[Hispania]] at the expense of the [[Suebi]] and [[Vandals]]. In 507, however, their rule in Gaul was ended by the [[Franks]] under [[Clovis I]], who defeated them in the [[Battle of Vouill\u00e9]]. After that, the Visigoth kingdom was limited to [[Hispania]], and they never again held territory north of the [[Pyrenees]] other than [[Septimania]]. A small, elite group of Visigoths came to dominate the governance of that region at the expense of those who had previously ruled there, particularly in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] province of [[Spania]] and the [[Kingdom of the Suebi]].\n\nIn or around 589, the Visigoths under [[Reccared I]] converted from [[Arianism]] to [[Nicene Christianity]], gradually adopting the culture of their Hispano-Roman subjects.{{sfn|Claude|1998|pp=119\u2013120}} Their legal code, the ''[[Visigothic Code]]'' (completed in 654) abolished the longstanding practice of applying different laws for Romans and Visigoths. Once legal distinctions were no longer being made between ''Romani'' and ''Gothi'', they became known collectively as ''Hispani''. In the century that followed, the region was dominated by the [[Councils of Toledo]] and the episcopacy. Little else is known about the Visigoths' history during the 7th century, since records are relatively sparse. In 711 or 712, an [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|invading force of Arabs and Berbers]] defeated the Visigoths in the [[Battle of Guadalete]]. Their king, [[Roderic]], and many members of their governing elite were killed, and their kingdom rapidly collapsed.\n\nDuring their governance of [[Hispania]], the Visigoths [[Visigothic art and architecture|built several churches]] that survive. They also left many artifacts, which have been discovered in increasing numbers by archaeologists in recent times. The [[Treasure of Guarrazar]] of [[votive crown]]s and crosses is the most spectacular. They founded the only new cities in western Europe from the fall of the Western half of the Roman Empire until the rise of the [[Carolingian dynasty]]. Many Visigothic names are still in use in modern [[List of Spanish words of Germanic origin#Names|Spanish]] and [[List of Portuguese words of Germanic origin#Names|Portuguese]]. Their most notable legacy, however, was the ''[[Visigothic Code]]'', which served, among other things, as the basis for court procedure in most of Christian [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] until the [[Late Middle Ages]], centuries after the demise of the kingdom.\n\n==Nomenclature: Vesi, Ostrogothi, Tervingi, Greuthungi==\n\nAmong the first references to Gothic tribes by Roman and Greek authors in the 4th century, appear the \"Vesi\", from which the name \"Visigoths\" derives, along with (among others), the \"[[Ostrogoths|Ostrogothi]]\", \"[[Thervingi]]\", and \"[[Greuthungi]]\". Based upon the medieval writer [[Jordanes]], whose work concerning the origins of the Goths is unreliable for many facts, scholars traditionally treated the terms \"Vesi\" and \"Tervingi\" as referring to one particular tribe, while the terms \"Ostrogothi\" and \"Greuthungi\" were used to refer to another. More specifically, Jordanes identified the Visigoth (Vesi) kings from [[Alaric I]] to [[Alaric II]] as the successors of the 4th century Tervingian king [[Athanaric]], and the Ostrogoth kings from [[Theoderic the Great]] to [[Theodahad]] as the heirs of the Greuthungi king [[Ermanaric]].{{sfn|Heather|1998|pp=300\u2013301}}\n\n[[Herwig Wolfram]], a scholar who still recently defends the equation of Vesi with the Tervingi, argues that while primary sources occasionally list all four names (as in, for example, ''Gruthungi, Austrogothi, Tervingi, Visi''), whenever they mention two different tribes, they always refer either to \"the Vesi and the Ostrogothi\" or to \"the Tervingi and the Greuthungi\", and they never pair them up in any other combination. In addition, Wolfram interprets the ''[[Notitia Dignitatum]]'' as equating the Vesi with the Tervingi in a reference to the years 388\u2013391.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=24-25}} On the other hand, another other recent interpretation of the ''Notitia'' is that the two names, Vesi and Tervingi, are found in different places in the list, \"a clear indication that we are dealing with two different army units, which must also presumably mean that they are, after all, perceived as two different peoples\".{{sfn|Christensen|2002|p=219}} Peter Heather has written that Wolfram's position is \"entirely arguable, but so is the opposite\".{{sfn|Heather|1999|p=75}}\n\n[[File:Gutthiuda.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|right|Gutthiuda{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}]]\n\nWolfram believes that \"Vesi\" and \"Ostrogothi\" were terms each tribe used to boastfully describe itself and argues that \"Tervingi\" and \"Greuthungi\" were geographical identifiers each tribe used to describe the other.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} This would explain why the latter terms dropped out of use shortly after 400, when the Goths were displaced by the [[Huns#Before Attila|Hunnic invasions]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=24}} Wolfram believes that the people Zosimus describes were those Tervingi who had remained behind after the Hunnic conquest.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=387, fn57}} For the most part, all of the terms discriminating between different Gothic tribes gradually disappeared after they moved into the Roman Empire.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} \n\nMany recent scholars, such as [[Peter Heather]], have concluded that Visigothic group identity emerged only within the Roman Empire.{{sfn|Heather|1998|pp=52\u201357, 130\u2013178, 302\u2013309}} [[Roger Collins]] also believes that the Visigothic identity emerged from the [[Gothic War (376\u2013382)|Gothic War of 376\u2013382]] when a collection of Tervingi, Greuthungi, and other \"barbarian\" contingents banded together in multiethnic ''[[foederati]]'' (Wolfram's \"federate armies\") under Alaric I in the eastern [[Balkans]], since they had become a multi ethnic group and could no longer claim to be exclusively Tervingian.{{sfn|Collins|2004|pp=22\u201324}}\n\nIn 456 and 458, the poet [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] used the old term Vesi to refer to the Visigoths in Gaul.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|p=219}}{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}}\n\nThe term \"Visigoth\" itself, based upon the older \"Vesi\", is first found in 507 in what is now France. [[Cassiodorus]], a Roman in the service of Theodoric the Great, invented the term \"Visigothic\" to match that of \"Ostrogothic\", terms he thought of as signifying \"western Goths\" and \"eastern Goths\" respectively.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} The western\u2013eastern division was a simplification (and a literary device) of 6th century historians; political realities were more complex.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} Further, Cassiodorus used the term \"Goths\" to refer only to the Ostrogoths, whom he served, and reserved the geographical term \"Visigoths\" for the Gallo-Spanish Goths. This usage was adopted by the Visigoths themselves in their communications with the [[Byzantine Empire]] and was still in use in the 7th century.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}}\n\nOther names for other Gothic divisions abounded. In 469, the Visigoths were called the \"Alaric Goths\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} The [[Frankish Table of Nations]], probably of Byzantine or Italian origin, referred to one of the two peoples as the ''Walagothi'', meaning \"Roman Goths\" (from Germanic *''[[walhaz]]'', foreign). This probably refers to the Romanized Visigoths after their entry into Spain.{{sfn|Goffart|1983|pp=125\u2013126}}\n\n===Etymology of Tervingi and Vesi/Visigothi===\nThe name ''Tervingi'' may mean \"forest people\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} This is supported by evidence that geographic descriptors were commonly used to distinguish people living north of the [[Black Sea]] both before and after Gothic settlement there, by evidence of forest-related names among the Tervingi, and by the lack of evidence for an earlier date for the name pair Tervingi\u2013Greuthungi than the late 3rd century.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=387\u2013388, fn58}} That the name ''Tervingi'' has pre-Pontic, possibly Scandinavian, origins still has support today.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=387, fn58}}\n\nThe Visigoths are called ''Wesi'' or ''Wisi'' by [[Trebellius Pollio]], Claudian, and Sidonius Apollinaris.{{sfn|Stevenson|1899|p=36, fn15}} The word is [[Gothic language|Gothic]] for \"good\", implying the \"good or worthy people\",{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} related to Gothic ''iusiza'' \"better\" and a reflex of [[Proto Indo-European Language|Indo-European]] *''wesu'' \"good\", akin to [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''gwiw'' \"excellent\", [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] ''eus'' \"good\", [[Sanskrit]] ''v\u00e1su-\u015f'' \"id.\". Jordanes relates the tribe's name to a river, though this is most likely a [[folk etymology]] or legend like his similar story about the Greuthung name.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=387, fn58}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Visigoth migrations.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.35|Migrations of the main column of the Visigoths]]\n\n===Early origins===\nThe Visigoths emerged from the Gothic tribes, most likely a derivative name for the [[Gutones]], a people believed to have their origins in [[Scandinavia]] and who migrated southeastwards into eastern Europe.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=39\u201340}} Such understanding of their origins is largely the result of Gothic traditions and their true genesis as a people is as obscure as that of the [[Franks]] and [[Alamanni]].{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=149}} The Visigoths spoke an eastern Germanic language that was distinct by the 4th century. Eventually the Gothic language died as a result of contact with other European people during the [[Middle Ages]].{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=844}}\n\nLong struggles between the neighboring Vandili and Lugii people with the Goths may have contributed to their earlier exodus into mainland Europe. The vast majority of them settled between the [[Oder]] and [[Vistula]] rivers until overpopulation (according to Gothic legends or tribal sagas) forced them to move south and east, where they settled just north of the [[Black Sea]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=42\u201343}} However, this legend is not supported by archaeological evidence so its validity is disputable. Historian Malcolm Todd contends that while this large ''en masse'' migration is possible, the movement of Gothic peoples south-east was more likely the result of warrior bands moving closer to the wealth of [[Ukraine]] and the cities of the Black Sea coast. Perhaps what is most notable about the Gothic people in this regard was that by the middle of the 3rd century AD, they were \"the most formidable military power beyond the lower Danube frontier\".{{sfn|Todd|2000|pp=149\u2013150}}{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=42\u201355}}\n\n====Contact with Rome====\n[[File:Tezaurul de la Pietroasele Closca MNIR Tezaur.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Pietroasele Treasure]] discovered in Romania, attributed to the Visigoths{{sfn|Odobescu|1889|p=1-100}}]]\nThroughout the third and fourth centuries there were numerous conflicts and exchanges of varying types between the Goths and their neighbors. After the Romans withdrew from the territory of Dacia, the local population was subjected to constant invasions by the migratory tribes, among the first being the Goths.{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|p=11}} In 238, the Goths invaded across the Danube into the Roman province of [[Moesia]], pillaging and exacting payment through hostage taking. During the war with the Persians that year, Goths also appeared in the Roman armies of [[Gordian III]].{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=150}} When subsidies to the Goths were stopped, the Goths organized and in 250 joined a major barbarian invasion led by the Germanic king, Kniva.{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=150}} Success on the battlefield against the Romans inspired additional invasions into the northern [[Balkans]] and deeper into [[Anatolia]].{{sfn|Todd|2000|pp=150\u2013151}} Starting in approximately 255, the Goths added a new dimension to their attacks by taking to the sea and invading harbors which brought them into conflict with the Greeks as well. When the city of [[Pityus]] fell to the Goths in 256, the Goths were further emboldened. Sometime between 266\u2013267, the Goths raided Greece but when they attempted to move into the Bosporus straits to attack Byzantium, they were repulsed. Along with other Germanic tribes, they attacked further into Anatolia, assaulting Crete and Cyprus on the way; shortly thereafter, they pillaged Troy and the temple of Artemis at Ephesus.{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=151}} Throughout the reign of emperor [[Constantine the Great]], the Visigoths continued to conduct raids on Roman territory south of the Danube River.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=844}} By 332, relations between the Goths and Romans were stabilized by a treaty but this was not to last.{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=152}}\n\n===War with Rome (376\u2013382)===\n{{Main|Gothic War (376\u2013382)}}\nThe Goths remained in [[Dacia]] until 376, when one of their leaders, [[Fritigern]], appealed to the Roman emperor [[Valens]] to be allowed to settle with his people on the south bank of the [[Danube River|Danube]]. Here, they hoped to find refuge from the [[Huns]].{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|pp=844\u2013845}} Valens permitted this, as he saw in them \"a splendid recruiting ground for his army\".{{sfn|Fuller|1998|p=55}} However, a [[famine]] broke out and Rome was unwilling to supply them with either the food they were promised or the land. Generally, the Goths were abused by the Romans,{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=845}} who began forcing the now starving Goths to trade away their children so as to stave off starvation.{{sfn|Durant|1950|p=24}} Open revolt ensued, leading to 6 years of plundering throughout the Balkans, the death of a Roman Emperor and a disastrous defeat of the Roman army.{{sfn|Durant|1950|pp=24\u201325}}\n\nThe [[Battle of Adrianople (378)|Battle of Adrianople]] in 378 was the decisive moment of the war. The Roman forces were slaughtered and the Emperor [[Valens]] was killed during the fighting.{{sfn|Sarris|2002|p=36}} Precisely how Valens fell remains uncertain but Gothic legend tells of how the emperor was taken to a farmhouse, which was set on fire above his head, a tale made more popular by its symbolic representation of a heretical emperor receiving hell's torment.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=178\u2013179}} Many of Rome's leading officers and some of their most elite fighting men died during the battle which struck a major blow to Roman prestige and the Empire's military capabilities.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=179}} Adrianople shocked the Roman world and eventually forced the Romans to negotiate with and settle the tribe within the empire's boundaries, a development with far-reaching consequences for the eventual [[fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall of Rome]]. Fourth-century Roman soldier and historian [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] ended his chronology of Roman history with this battle.{{sfn|Katz|1955|pp=88\u201389}}\n\nDespite the severe consequences for Rome, Adrianople was not nearly as productive overall for the Visigoths and their gains were short-lived. Still confined to a small and relatively impoverished province of the Empire, another Roman army was being gathered against them, an army which also had amid its ranks other disaffected Goths.{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=154}} Intense campaigns against the Visigoths followed their victory at Adrianople for upwards of three years. Approach routes across the Danube provinces were effectively sealed off by concerted Roman efforts, and while there was no decisive victory to claim, it was essentially a Roman triumph ending in a treaty in 382. The treaty struck with the Goths was to be the first ''foedus'' on imperial Roman soil. It required these semi-autonomous Germanic tribes to raise troops for the Roman army in exchange for arable land and freedom from Roman legal structures within the Empire.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=179\u2013180}}{{Efn|Other sources dispute the contents of the supposed \"treaty\" and claim it was a Gothic surrender.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=180\u2013181}} }}\n\n===Reign of Alaric I===\n[[File:Alaric entering Athens.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|right|An illustration of [[Alaric I|Alaric]] entering [[Athens]] in 395]]\n{{Main|Alaric I}}\nThe new emperor, [[Theodosius I]], made peace with the rebels, and this peace held essentially unbroken until Theodosius died in 395.{{sfn|Burns|2003|pp=322, 374}} In that year, the Visigoths' most famous king, [[Alaric I]], made a bid for the throne, but controversy and intrigue erupted between the East and West, as General [[Stilicho]] tried to maintain his position in the empire.{{sfn|Heather|2013|pp=153\u2013160}} Theodosius was succeeded by his incompetent sons: [[Arcadius]] in the east and [[Flavius Augustus Honorius|Honorius]] in the west. In 397, Alaric was named military commander of the eastern Illyrian prefecture by Arcadius.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=845}}\n\nOver the next 15 years, an uneasy peace was broken by occasional conflicts between Alaric and the powerful Germanic generals who commanded the Roman armies in the east and west, wielding the real power of the empire.{{sfn|Heather|2013|pp=183\u2013223}} Finally, after the western general Stilicho was executed by Honorius in 408 and the Roman legions massacred the families of thousands of barbarian soldiers who were trying to assimilate into the Roman empire, Alaric decided to march on Rome.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|pp=204\u2013205}} After two defeats in Northern Italy and a siege of Rome ended by a negotiated pay-off, Alaric was cheated by another Roman faction. He resolved to cut the city off by capturing its port. On August 24, 410, however, Alaric's troops entered Rome through the [[Salarian Gate]], and [[sack of Rome (410)|sacked the city]].{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=214\u2013217}} However, Rome, while still the official capital, was no longer the ''de facto'' seat of the government of the Western Roman Empire. From the late 370s up to 402, [[Milan]] was the seat of government, but after the siege of Milan the Imperial Court moved to [[Ravenna]] in 402. Honorius visited Rome often, and after his death in 423 the emperors resided mostly there. Rome's fall severely shook the Empire's confidence, especially in the West. Loaded with booty, Alaric and the Visigoths extracted as much as they could with the intention of leaving Italy from Basilicata to northern [[Africa]]. Alaric died before the disembarkation and was buried supposedly near the ruins of Croton. He was succeeded by his wife's brother.{{sfn|Collins|1999|pp=63\u201365}}\n\n===Visigothic Kingdom===\n{{Main|Visigothic Kingdom}}\n[[File:Europe and the Near East at 476 AD.png|thumb|upright=1.6|Europe at the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD]]\n\nThe Visigothic Kingdom was a Western European power in the 5th to 7th centuries, created in Gaul when the Romans lost their control of the western half of their empire. For a brief period, the Visigoths controlled the strongest kingdom in Western Europe.{{sfn|Williams|2004|p=51}} In response to the invasion of [[Hispania|Roman Hispania]] of 409 by the [[Vandals]], [[Alans]] and [[Suebi]], [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]], the emperor in the West, enlisted the aid of the Visigoths to regain control of the territory. From 408 to 410 the Visigoths caused so much damage to Rome and the immediate periphery that nearly a decade later, the provinces in and around the city were only able to contribute one-seventh of their previous tax shares.{{sfn|Heather|2005|p=434}}\n\nIn 418, Honorius rewarded his Visigothic [[foederati|federates]] by giving them land in [[Gallia Aquitania]] on which to settle after they had attacked the four tribes \u2013 Sueves, Asding and Siling Vandala and Alans \u2013 who had crossed the Rhine near Mainz the last day of 409 and eventually were invited into Spain by a Roman usurper in the Fall of 409 (the latter two tribes were devastated). This was probably done under ''hospitalitas'', the rules for billeting army soldiers.{{sfn|Sivan|1987|pp=759\u2013772}} The settlement formed the nucleus of the future Visigothic kingdom that would eventually expand across the [[Pyrenees]] and onto the Iberian peninsula. That Visigothic settlement proved paramount to Europe's future as had it not been for the Visigothic warriors who fought side-by-side with the Roman troops under general [[Flavius Aetius]], it is perhaps possible that [[Attila]] would have seized control of Gaul, rather than the Romans being able to retain dominance.{{sfn|Burns|2003|p=382}}\n\nThe Visigoths' second great king, [[Euric]], unified the various quarreling factions among the Visigoths and, in 475, forced the Roman government to come to terms, but the emperor did not legally recognize Gothic sovereignty; instead the emperor was content to be called a friend (''amicus'') to the Visigoths, while requiring them to address him as lord (''dominus'').{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=186\u2013187}} Between 471\u2013476, Euric captured most of southern Gaul.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|p=358}} According to historian J.

It goes into more detail than a modern constitution commonly does and reveals a great deal about Visigothic social structure.{{sfn|Collins|2004|pp=6\u20138}}\n\nOne of the greatest contributions of the Visigoths to [[family law]] was their protection of the property rights of married women, which was continued by [[Law of Spain|Spanish law]] and ultimately evolved into the [[community property]] system now in force throughout the majority of western Europe.{{sfn|Coolidge|2011|pp=17\u201325}}\n\n===Religion===\nBefore the [[Middle Ages]], the Visigoths, as well as other Germanic peoples, followed what is now referred to as [[Germanic paganism]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|pp=58, 66, 72\u201374}} While the Germanic peoples were slowly converted to [[Christianity]] by varying means, many elements of the pre-Christian culture and indigenous beliefs remained firmly in place after the conversion process, particularly in the more rural and distant regions.{{sfn|James|2009|pp=215\u2013225}}\n\nThe Visigoths, [[Ostrogoths]], and [[Vandals]] were [[Christianized]] while they were still outside the bounds of the [[Roman Empire]]; however, they converted to [[Arianism]] rather than to the [[Nicene Christianity|Nicene version]] (Trinitarianism) followed by most Romans, who considered them [[Christian heresy|heretics]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|pp=75\u201379}} There was a religious gulf between the Visigoths, who had for a long time adhered to Arianism, and their Catholic subjects in Hispania. There were also deep sectarian splits among the Catholic population of the peninsula which contributed to the toleration of the Arian Visigoths on the peninsula. The Visigoths scorned to interfere among Catholics but were interested in decorum and public order.{{Efn|At least one high-ranking Visigoth, [[Zerezindo]], ''dux'' of Baetica, was a Catholic in the mid-6th century.}} King [[Liuvigild]] (568\u2013586), attempted to restore political unity between the Visigothic-Arian elite and the Hispano-Roman Nicene Catholic population through a doctrinal settlement of compromise on matters of faith, but this failed.{{sfn|Heather|2013|p=325}} Sources indicate that the Iberian Visigoths maintained their Christian Arianism, especially the Visigothic elite until the end of Liuvigild's reign.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|pp=265\u2013269}} When Reccared I converted to Catholicism, he sought to unify the kingdom under a single faith.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|p=304}}{{sfn|Mathisen|Sivan|1999|p=40}}\n\n[[File:Wisi San Pedro de la Nave e chapiteau a.jpg|thumb|left|Capital from the Visigothic church of [[San Pedro de la Nave]], [[province of Zamora]]]]\n\nWhen the Visigoths took over Spain, [[Jews]] constituted a large and ancient proportion of the population. Many were farmers, but they worked in a wide range of occupations, and were a major component of the urbanized population of the larger towns particularly of eastern Spain. During the period in which the Visigoths adhered to Arianism, the situation of the Jews seems to have remained relatively good.  Previous Roman and Byzantine law determined their status, and it already sharply discriminated against them, but royal jurisdiction was in any case quite limited: local lords and populations related to Jews as they saw fit. We read of rabbis being asked by non-Jews to bless their fields, for example.{{sfn|Graetz|1894|p=44}} Historian Jane Gerber relates that some of the Jews \"held ranking posts in the government or the army; others were recruited and organized for garrison service; still others continued to hold senatorial rank\".{{sfn|Gerber|1992|p=9}} In general, then, they were well respected and well-treated by the Visigothic kings, that is, until their transition from Arianism to Catholicism.{{sfn|Roth|1994|pp=35\u201340}}\n\nCatholic conversion across Visigothic society reduced much of the friction between their people and the native Spanish population.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=847}} One chief purpose of this conversion was to unify the realm under the Church, and one of the key complaints of the Church had long been that Jews had too much status, prosperity and influence. Local nobles relied on their Jewish and non-Jewish sectors of the population to enhance the local economy and the noble's independent power. Visigothic political structure had traditionally given extensive powers to local nobles (who even elected their kings), so the king was in many ways merely 'the first amongst equals,' and central authority was weak. The status of the Jews therefore impacted local aristocrats both symbolically and politically.\n\nKing Reccared convened the Third Council of Toledo to settle religious disputations related to the religious conversion from Arianism to Catholicism.{{sfn|Collins|1999|pp=211\u2013212}} The discriminatory laws passed at this Council seem not to have been universally enforced, however, as indicated by several more Councils of Toledo that repeated these laws and extended their stringency.  These entered canon law and became legal precedents in other parts of Europe as well.  The culmination of this process occurred under King Sisibut, who decreed a forced Christian conversion upon all Jews in Spain.{{sfn|Collins|2000|p=60}} This mandate apparently achieved only partial success: similar decrees were repeated by later kings as central power was consolidated. These laws either prescribed forcible baptism of the Jews or forbade circumcision, Jewish rites, and the observance of the Sabbath and other festivals. Throughout the seventh century, Jews were flogged, executed, had their property confiscated, were subjected to ruinous taxes, forbidden to trade and, at times, dragged to the baptismal font. Many were obliged to accept Christianity but continued privately to observe the Jewish religion and practices.{{sfn|Gonzalez-Salinero|1999|pp=140\u2013147}} The decree of 613 set off a century of torment for Spanish Jewry, which was only ended by the Muslim conquest.{{Efn|Cf. the extensive accounts of Visigothic Jewish history by Heinrich Graetz, ''History of the Jews'', Vol. 3 (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1956 reprint [1894]), pp. 43\u201352 (on Sisibut, pp. 47\u201349); Salo W.

Cohen and D. Sorkin, ''The Oxford Handbook of Jewish Studies'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 156.}}\n\nThe political aspects of the imposition of Church power cannot be ignored in these matters. With the conversion of the Visigothic kings to [[Chalcedonian Christianity]], the bishops increased their power, until, at the [[Fourth Council of Toledo]] in 633, they selected a king from among the royal family, a practice previously reserved for nobles. This was the same synod that declared that all Jews must be [[baptism|baptised]]. As far as the Visigoths were concerned, the time for religious pluralism \"was past\".{{sfn|Lim|1999|pp=209\u2013210}} By the end of the 7th century, Catholic conversion made the Visigoths less distinguishable from the indigenous Roman citizens of the Iberian peninsula; when the last Visigothic strongholds fell to the Muslim armies, whose subsequent invasions transformed Spain from the beginning of the 8th century, their Gothic identity faded.{{sfn|Collins|2000|pp=60\u201362}}\n\nIn the eighth through 11th centuries, the [[muladi|''muwallad'']] clan of the [[Banu Qasi]] claimed descent from the Visigothic [[Count Cassius]].{{sfn|Fletcher|2006|p=45}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Germanic culture}}\n*[[Romano-Germanic culture]]\n*[[Germanic peoples]]\n*[[Arianism]]\n*[[Thiufa]]\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{notelist}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n* {{cite book| last=Arce |first=Javier| chapter=The City of Merida (Emerita) in the Vitas Patrum Emeritensium (Vith Century) | title=East and West, Modes of Communication: Proceedings of the First Plenary Conference at Merida  | editor1=Evangelos Chrysos | editor2=Ian Wood| volume=Vol. 5 [Transformation of the Roman World] | year = 1999| location = Leiden | publisher = Brill | isbn=978-9-00410-929-2|ref = harv}}\n*{{cite book | last=Burns | first=Thomas | year=2003 | title= Rome and the Barbarians, 100 B.C.\u2013A.D. 400 | place= Baltimore, MD | publisher= Johns Hopkins University Press | isbn= 978-0-80187-306-5 | ref = harv}}\n*{{cite book | last=Bury | first=J.

It features [[George Kennedy]]'s final film performance before his death in 2016.\n\n==Plot==\nJim Bennett is a [[Los Angeles]] literature professor who uses gambling as a way of self-destruction. He ends up owing $240,000 to Lee, the proprietor of an exclusive, high-stakes underground gambling ring, and another $50,000 to Neville Baraka, a [[loan shark]]. Lee gives Jim seven days to pay off his debts or be murdered.\n\nDuring one of his classes, Jim begins an awkward discussion of literary excellence based on [[Shakespeare]] as an example, discussing how almost all aspiring writers fail to accomplish literary excellence. Jim singles out some exemplary athletes in his class for discussion. First he picks Dexter, an emerging tennis star; he later confronts a basketball student star, Lamar Allen, who does not pay attention in class but intends to become an [[NBA]] basketball player. Jim expresses his extremist view on achieving excellence in one's field or vocation of choice. If you can't be exemplary, Jim reasons, then you might as well resign yourself to mediocrity. Making a general comment to the class, he tells them that no one but Amy Phillips, a quiet student, is capable of a career in literature. Jim identifies Amy as a potential writing prodigy based on her previous writings in his class, as well as having previously encountered her working surreptitiously as a waitress at the underground gambling house. Amy develops a personal interest in Jim, which he reciprocates.\n\nAfter the class, Jim visits his mother Roberta at the family's luxury estate, but she says that she will not give him any more money. Jim considers borrowing money from Frank (another loan shark) to consolidate his debts and buy himself some time, but refuses to do so after Frank's demands include that Jim admit \u201cI am not a man\u201d. Jim convinces Roberta to give him enough money to pay off his debts, expressing no gratitude to her, then gambles it all away during a trip to a casino with Amy. Baraka kidnaps Jim, has him tied-up and tortured, and then confronts him with an ultimatum\u2014if he does not convince Lamar to [[Point shaving|win one of his college basketball games by a margin of 7 points or less]], he will murder Amy.\n\nJim goes to Frank, who advises him to change his version of a \"fuck you\" attitude towards life by getting enough money to build a safe house and make reliable low yield investments, for protection against his severe gambling losses. Frank lends him $260,000 to pay his debt to Lee, but also threatens to kill everyone in Jim's personal life if he is not repaid. Lee's men assault Jim when he comes to ask Lee to stake him $150,000, saying the only way he can pay his full $410,000 debt to Lee and Frank is to gamble and win. He uses the $150,000 to bribe Lamar into going along with the basketball point-shaving scheme. Jim sends Dexter to [[Las Vegas]] to bet on the game with the $260,000 he got from Frank. Lamar succeeds, barely, so Jim uses his winnings to pay his debt to Baraka, denying he knows anything about the large bet made in Vegas.\n\nJim then convinces both Lee and Frank to meet him in a neutral gambling den, where he wagers enough money to pay both men off\u2014if he wins\u2014on a single roulette spin. Successful, he leaves the money at the club for Lee and Frank. The payment to Frank is more than he owed; Frank finds Jim and offers to give back the \u201ccream\u201d but, to Frank's amusement, Jim responds \u201cFuck you\u201d. On an apparent adrenaline rush, Jim runs miles through the city to arrive at Amy's apartment; he is broke, but free from debt.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Mark Wahlberg]] as Jim Bennett\n* [[John Goodman]] as Frank\n* [[Brie Larson]] as Amy Phillips\n* [[Michael K.

It features [[George Kennedy]]'s final film performance before his death in 2016.\n\n==Plot==\nJim Bennett is a [[Los Angeles]] literature professor who uses gambling as a way of self-destruction. He ends up owing $240,000 to Lee, the proprietor of an exclusive, high-stakes underground gambling ring, and another $50,000 to Neville Baraka, a [[loan shark]]. Lee gives Jim seven days to pay off his debts or be murdered.\n\nDuring one of his classes, Jim begins an awkward discussion of literary excellence based on Shakespeare as an example, discussing how almost all aspiring writers fail to accomplish literary excellence. Jim singles out some exemplary athletes in his class for discussion. First he picks Dexter, an emerging tennis star; he later confronts a basketball student star, Lamar Allen, who does not pay attention in class but intends to become an [[NBA]] basketball player. Jim expresses his extremist view on achieving excellence in one's field or vocation of choice. If you can't be exemplary, Jim reasons, then you might as well resign yourself to mediocrity. Making a general comment to the class, he tells them that no one but Amy Phillips, a quiet student, is capable of a career in literature. Jim identifies Amy as a potential writing prodigy based on her previous writings in his class, as well as having previously encountered her working surreptitiously as a waitress at the underground gambling house. Amy develops a personal interest in Jim, which he reciprocates.\n\nAfter the class, Jim visits his mother Roberta at the family's luxury estate, but she says that she will not give him any more money. Jim considers borrowing money from Frank (another loan shark) to consolidate his debts and buy himself some time, but refuses to do so after Frank's demands include that Jim admit \u201cI am not a man\u201d. Jim convinces Roberta to give him enough money to pay off his debts, expressing no gratitude to her, then gambles it all away during a trip to a casino with Amy. Baraka kidnaps Jim, has him tied-up and tortured, and then confronts him with an ultimatum\u2014if he does not convince Lamar to [[Point shaving|win one of his college basketball games by a margin of 7 points or less]], he will murder Amy.\n\nJim goes to Frank, who advises him to change his version of a \"fuck you\" attitude towards life by getting enough money to build a safe house and make reliable low yield investments, for protection against his severe gambling losses. Frank lends him $260,000 to pay his debt to Lee, but also threatens to kill everyone in Jim's personal life if he is not repaid. Lee's men assault Jim when he comes to ask Lee to stake him $150,000, saying the only way he can pay his full $410,000 debt to Lee and Frank is to gamble and win. He uses the $150,000 to bribe Lamar into going along with the basketball point-shaving scheme. Jim sends Dexter to [[Las Vegas]] to bet on the game with the $260,000 he got from Frank. Lamar succeeds, barely, so Jim uses his winnings to pay his debt to Baraka, denying he knows anything about the large bet made in Vegas.\n\nJim then convinces both Lee and Frank to meet him in a neutral gambling den, where he wagers enough money to pay both men off\u2014if he wins\u2014on a single roulette spin. Successful, he leaves the money at the club for Lee and Frank. The payment to Frank is more than he owed; Frank finds Jim and offers to give back the \u201ccream\u201d but, to Frank's amusement, Jim responds \u201cFuck you\u201d. On an apparent adrenaline rush, Jim runs miles through the city to arrive at Amy's apartment; he is broke, but free from debt.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Mark Wahlberg]] as Jim Bennett\n* [[John Goodman]] as Frank\n* [[Brie Larson]] as Amy Phillips\n* [[Michael K.

In 1898, the British introduced coffee to the [[East Godavari]] district in [[Pamuluru]] before it spread to Araku in the early 19th century. After independence, the [[Andhra Pradesh Forest Department]] took up coffee plantations in the valley and by 1956, the [[Coffee Board of India]] appointed Girijan Cooperative Corporation (GCC) for its promotion through local tribal farmers. In a significant development, the Naidu Government and [[SpiceJet]], the third largest airline in the country by number of domestic passengers carried, came forward to serve the organic brew of Araku to its passengers. SpiceJet air hostesses would make special announcements about the brand and its significance, and about the coffee plantations in Araku Valley. To increase visits to tourist places located around Araku Valley, a scheme of scratch cards was introduced. Cards would be given to every passenger and two lucky passengers, along with their families, would receive free accommodation in Araku Valley and the tourism department would pay to the airline towards promotion of Araku Coffee. The brand became so popular and exotic that Naidu gifted them to Korean and Russian delegates during their visits and the coffee was marketed in all the international investor meetings organized by the state.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/Naidu-markets-Araku-coffee-at-womens-meet/articleshow/51893052.cms|title=Naidu markets Araku coffee at women's meet|date=19 April 2016 |work=The Times of India|language=en|access-date=16 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yovizag.com/araku-coffee-exotic-brand/|title=Coffee From Araku - Our Very Own Exotic Brand |date=27 May 2017|website=Yo Vizag|language=en-US|access-date=16 March 2020}}</ref> Naidu once said that Araku Valley\u2019s tribal coffee is competing with Columbian and Sumatran coffee in the international market.
