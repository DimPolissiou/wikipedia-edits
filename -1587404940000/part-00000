Created by [[Namco]]'s [[Project Soul]] division, she first appeared in the original ''[[Soulcalibur (video game)|Soulcalibur]]'' and its subsequent sequels, later appearing in various merchandise related to the series. She was voiced in Japanese by [[Yumi T\u014dma]] between ''[[Soulcalibur (video game)|Soulcalibur]]'' and ''[[Soulcalibur III]]'', [[Kanako T\u014dj\u014d]] between ''[[Soulcalibur Legends]]'' and ''[[Soulcalibur: Broken Destiny]],'' and [[Miyuki Sawashiro]] in ''[[Soulcalibur V]]'', and ''[[Soulcalibur VI]]''; in English, she was voiced by Renee Hewitt in ''[[Soulcalibur II]]'' and [[Lani Minella]] for the remainder of the series.\n\nIn the game, she is the [[illegitimacy|illegitimate]] daughter of undead pirate [[Cervantes de Leon]] who was raised by a [[nobility|noble]] family until her father became obsessed with the cursed sword, Soul Edge, leading to his death and later her mother's. Desiring to destroy the sword, she creates a segmented, animated blade-whip, only to become Soul Edge's pawn and learn that it intends to use her as its next host. After an attack by Cervantes results in the loss of her soul, Ivy uses a temporary artificial one to keep herself alive, and continues after the blade.\n\nIvy is considered one of the most prominent characters in the series as well as one of its mainstays, having appeared in every installment since ''Soulcalibur''. She is often referred to as the series' [[pin-up model|poster girl]]. Since her introduction, Ivy has been regarded as an attractive and strong character by critics, and has been noted for her sex appeal. Critical reception varies, with some saying the character's oversexualization is unnecessary, while others have argued that her sexuality is an essential aspect of her character design and has allowed for her to be more recognizable.\n\n==Conception and history==\nAs a character introduced in ''Soulcalibur'', Ivy's [[signature weapon]], a \"snake sword\" designed to be unique amongst the other weapons in the game, was selected before other elements of the character. Her design and concept were then built to revolve around it, starting with gender, then physical measurements, and lastly background details.

Created by [[Namco]]'s [[Project Soul]] division, she first appeared in the original ''[[Soulcalibur (video game)|Soulcalibur]]'' and its subsequent sequels, later appearing in various merchandise related to the series. She was voiced in Japanese by [[Yumi T\u014dma]] between ''[[Soulcalibur (video game)|Soulcalibur]]'' and ''[[Soulcalibur III]]'', [[Kanako T\u014dj\u014d]] between ''[[Soulcalibur Legends]]'' and ''[[Soulcalibur: Broken Destiny]],'' and [[Miyuki Sawashiro]] in ''[[Soulcalibur V]]'', and ''[[Soulcalibur VI]]''; in English, she was voiced by Renee Hewitt in ''[[Soulcalibur II]]'' and [[Lani Minella]] for the remainder of the series.\n\nIn the game, she is the [[illegitimacy|illegitimate]] daughter of undead pirate [[Cervantes de Leon]] who was raised by a [[nobility|noble]] family until her father became obsessed with the cursed sword, Soul Edge, leading to his death and later her mother's. Desiring to destroy the sword, she creates a segmented, animated blade-whip, only to become Soul Edge's pawn and learn that it intends to use her as its next host. After an attack by Cervantes results in the loss of her soul, Ivy uses a temporary artificial one to keep herself alive, and continues after the blade.\n\nIvy is considered one of the most prominent characters in the series as well as one of its mainstays, having appeared in every installment since ''Soulcalibur''. She is often referred to as the series' [[pin-up model|poster girl]]. Since her introduction, Ivy has been regarded as an attractive and strong character by critics, and has been noted for her sex appeal.

In early childhood, moved with his family to Lonqu\u00e9n. His father was illiterate and encouraged his children to work from an early age to help the family survive, rather than attend school. By the age of 6, Jara was already working on the land. His father could not support the family on his earnings as a peasant at the Ruiz-Tagle estate, nor was he able to find stable work. He took to drinking and became increasingly violent. His relationship with his wife deteriorated, and he left the family to look for work when V\u00edctor was still a child.\n\nJara's mother raised him and his siblings, and insisted that they get a good education. A [[mestiza]] with deep [[Araucanian]] roots in southern Chile, she was [[autodidactic|self-taught]], and played the guitar and the piano. She also performed as a singer, with a repertory of traditional folk songs that she used for local functions like weddings and funerals.<ref>Jara, Joan. ''V\u00edctor: An Unfinished Song'', 24-27</ref>\n\nShe died when Jara was 15, leaving him to make his own way. He began to study to be an accountant, but soon moved into a [[seminary]], where he studied for the priesthood. After a couple of years, however, he became disillusioned with the [[Catholic Church]] and left the seminary. Subsequently, he spent several years in army service before returning to his hometown to pursue interests in [[folk music]] and [[theatre|theater]].<ref name=\"notablebiographies.com\">{{Cite web|title = Victor Jara Biography - life, family, childhood, children, parents, death, wife, school|url = http://www.notablebiographies.com/supp/Supplement-Fl-Ka/Jara-Victor.html|website = www.notablebiographies.com|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}</ref>\n\n==Artistic work==\nAfter joining the choir at the [[University of Chile]] in Santiago, Jara was convinced by a choir-mate to pursue a career in theater. He subsequently joined the university's theater program and earned a scholarship for talent.<ref name=\"notablebiographies.com\" /> He appeared in several of the university's plays, gravitating toward those with social themes, such as Russian playwright [[Maxim Gorky]]'s ''The Lower Depths'', a depiction of the hardships of lower-class life.<ref name=\"notablebiographies.com\" />\n\nIn 1957, he met [[Violeta Parra]], a singer who had steered folk music in Chile away from the rote reproduction of rural materials toward modern song composition rooted in traditional forms, and who had established musical community centers called ''pe\u00f1as'' to incorporate folk music into the everyday life of modern Chileans. Jara absorbed these lessons and began singing with a group called Cuncum\u00e9n, with whom he continued his explorations of Chile's traditional music.<ref name=\"notablebiographies.com\" /> He was deeply influenced by the folk music of Chile and other Latin American countries, and by artists such as Parra, [[Atahualpa Yupanqui]], and the poet [[Pablo Neruda]].\n\nIn the 1960s, Jara started specializing in folk music and sang at Santiago's La Pe\u00f1a de Los Parra, owned by [[\u00c1ngel Parra]]. Through these activities, he became involved in the [[Nueva canci\u00f3n|Nueva Canci\u00f3n]] movement of Latin American folk music. He released his first album, ''Canto a lo humano'', in 1966, and by 1970, he had left his theater work in favor of a career in music. His songs were inspired by a combination of traditional folk music and left-wing political activism. From this period, some of his best-known songs are \"Plegaria a un Labrador\" (\"Prayer to a Worker\") and \"Te Recuerdo Amanda\" (\"I Remember You Amanda\").\n\n==Political activism==\nEarly in his recording career, Jara showed a knack for antagonizing conservative Chileans, releasing a traditional comic song called \"La beata\" that depicted a religious woman with a crush on the priest to whom she goes for [[Confession (religion)|confession]]. The song was banned on radio stations and removed from record shops, but the controversy only added to Jara's reputation among young and progressive Chileans.<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\">[http://www.news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/165363.stm \"'They Couldn't Kill His Songs,'\"] BBC News, World: Americas]</ref> More serious in the eyes of the Chilean right wing was Jara's growing identification with the socialist movement led by [[Salvador Allende]]. After visits to [[Cuba]] and the [[Soviet Union]] in the early 1960s, Jara had joined the [[Communist Party of Chile|Communist Party]]. The personal met the political in his songs about the poverty he had experienced firsthand.<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\" />\n\nJara's songs spread outside Chile and were performed by American folk artists.<ref name=\"allmusic.com\">\"Victor Jara,\" ''All Music Guide'', http://www.allmusic.com (16 January 2007)</ref> His popularity was due not only to his songwriting skills but also to his exceptional power as a performer. He took a decisive turn toward political confrontation with his 1969 song \"Preguntas por Puerto Montt\" (\"Questions About Puerto Montt\"), which took direct aim at a government official who had ordered police to attack squatters in the town of [[Puerto Montt]]. The Chilean political situation deteriorated after the official was assassinated, and right-wing thugs beat up Jara on one occasion.<ref name=\"allmusic.com\" />\n\nIn 1970, Jara supported Allende, the [[Popular Unity (Chile)|Popular Unity]] coalition candidate for president, volunteering for political work and playing free concerts.<ref>Jara, Joan. ''V\u00edctor: An Unfinished Song,''</ref> He composed \"[[Venceremos (song)|Venceremos]]\" (\"We Will Triumph\"), the theme song of Allende's Popular Unity movement, and welcomed Allende's election to the Chilean presidency in 1970. After the election, Jara continued to speak in support of Allende and played an important role in the new administration's efforts to reorient Chilean culture.<ref>Mularski, Jedrek.

He set poems by Pablo Neruda to music and performed at a ceremony honoring him after Neruda received the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1972. Throughout rumblings of a right-wing coup, Jara held on to his teaching job at [[University of Santiago, Chile#Universidad T\u00e9cnica del Estado|Chile's Technical University]]. His popular success during this time, as both a musician and a Communist, earned him a concert in [[Moscow]]. So successful was he that the Soviet Union tried to latch onto his popularity, claiming in their media that his vocal prowess was the result of surgery he had undergone while in Moscow.<ref>{{Cite book|title = OUR MAN IN CHILE, OR VICTOR JARA'S POSTHUMOUS LIFE IN SOVIET MEDIA AND POPULAR CULTURE|last = Minkova|first = Yuliya|publisher = Virginia Tech|year = 2013|isbn = |location = |pages = 608}}</ref>\n\nBacked by the United States, which opposed Allende's [[socialist]] politics, the Chilean military staged a [[1973 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat on September 11, 1973]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Hitchens |first=Christopher |title=The Trial of Henry Kissinger |year=2001 |publisher=Twelve |location=New York |isbn=978-1455522972 |page=304}}</ref> resulting in the death of Allende and the installation of [[Augusto Pinochet]] as dictator.

The troops prohibited civilians from entering or leaving the university premises. During the afternoon of 12 September 1973, military personnel entered the university and illegally detained hundreds of professors, students, and administrators. V\u00edctor Jara was among those arbitrarily detained on the campus and was subsequently transferred to Chile Stadium, where he was tortured and killed. \n* In the course of transporting and processing the civilian prisoners, Captain Fernando Polanco Gallardo, a commanding officer in military intelligence, recognized Jara as the well-known folk singer whose songs addressed social inequality, and who had supported President Allende's government. Captain Polanco separated Jara from the group and beat him severely. He then transferred Jara, along with some of the other civilians, to the stadium.\n* Throughout his detention in the locker room of the stadium, Jara was in the physical custody of Lieutenant Barrientos, soldiers under his command, or other members of the Chilean Army who acted in accordance with the army's plan to commit human rights abuses against civilians.\n* The arbitrary detention, torture, and extrajudicial killing of Jara and other detainees were part of a widespread, systematic attack on civilians by the Chilean Army from 11\u201315 September 1973.

His exact place of birth is uncertain. For some, he was born in [[San Ignacio, Chile|San Ignacio]], near Chill\u00e1n; but there are also rumors he could have been born in Quiriquina, one of the small towns nearby San Ignacio. In early childhood, moved with his family to Lonqu\u00e9n. His father was illiterate and encouraged his children to work from an early age to help the family survive, rather than attend school. By the age of 6, Jara was already working on the land. His father could not support the family on his earnings as a peasant at the Ruiz-Tagle estate, nor was he able to find stable work. He took to drinking and became increasingly violent. His relationship with his wife deteriorated, and he left the family to look for work when V\u00edctor was still a child.\n\nJara's mother raised him and his siblings, and insisted that they get a good education. A [[mestiza]] with deep [[Araucanian]] roots in southern Chile, she was [[autodidactic|self-taught]], and played the guitar and the piano. She also performed as a singer, with a repertory of traditional folk songs that she used for local functions like weddings and funerals.<ref>Jara, Joan. ''V\u00edctor: An Unfinished Song'', 24-27</ref>\n\nShe died when Jara was 15, leaving him to make his own way. He began to study to be an accountant, but soon moved into a [[seminary]], where he studied for the priesthood. After a couple of years, however, he became disillusioned with the [[Catholic Church]] and left the seminary. Subsequently, he spent several years in army service before returning to his hometown to pursue interests in [[folk music]] and [[theatre|theater]].<ref name=\"notablebiographies.com\">{{Cite web|title = Victor Jara Biography - life, family, childhood, children, parents, death, wife, school|url = http://www.notablebiographies.com/supp/Supplement-Fl-Ka/Jara-Victor.html|website = www.notablebiographies.com|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}</ref>\n\n==Artistic work==\nAfter joining the choir at the [[University of Chile]] in Santiago, Jara was convinced by a choir-mate to pursue a career in theater. He subsequently joined the university's theater program and earned a scholarship for talent.<ref name=\"notablebiographies.com\" /> He appeared in several of the university's plays, gravitating toward those with social themes, such as Russian playwright [[Maxim Gorky]]'s ''The Lower Depths'', a depiction of the hardships of lower-class life.<ref name=\"notablebiographies.com\" />\n\nIn 1957, he met [[Violeta Parra]], a singer who had steered folk music in Chile away from the rote reproduction of rural materials toward modern song composition rooted in traditional forms, and who had established musical community centers called ''pe\u00f1as'' to incorporate folk music into the everyday life of modern Chileans. Jara absorbed these lessons and began singing with a group called Cuncum\u00e9n, with whom he continued his explorations of Chile's traditional music.<ref name=\"notablebiographies.com\" /> He was deeply influenced by the folk music of Chile and other Latin American countries, and by artists such as Parra, [[Atahualpa Yupanqui]], and the poet [[Pablo Neruda]].\n\nIn the 1960s, Jara started specializing in folk music and sang at Santiago's La Pe\u00f1a de Los Parra, owned by [[\u00c1ngel Parra]]. Through these activities, he became involved in the [[Nueva canci\u00f3n|Nueva Canci\u00f3n]] movement of Latin American folk music. He released his first album, ''Canto a lo humano'', in 1966, and by 1970, he had left his theater work in favor of a career in music. His songs were inspired by a combination of traditional folk music and left-wing political activism. From this period, some of his best-known songs are \"Plegaria a un Labrador\" (\"Prayer to a Worker\") and \"Te Recuerdo Amanda\" (\"I Remember You Amanda\").\n\n==Political activism==\nEarly in his recording career, Jara showed a knack for antagonizing conservative Chileans, releasing a traditional comic song called \"La beata\" that depicted a religious woman with a crush on the priest to whom she goes for [[Confession (religion)|confession]]. The song was banned on radio stations and removed from record shops, but the controversy only added to Jara's reputation among young and progressive Chileans.<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\">[http://www.news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/165363.stm \"'They Couldn't Kill His Songs,'\"] BBC News, World: Americas]</ref> More serious in the eyes of the Chilean right wing was Jara's growing identification with the socialist movement led by [[Salvador Allende]]. After visits to [[Cuba]] and the [[Soviet Union]] in the early 1960s, Jara had joined the [[Communist Party of Chile|Communist Party]]. The personal met the political in his songs about the poverty he had experienced firsthand.<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\" />\n\nJara's songs spread outside Chile and were performed by American folk artists.<ref name=\"allmusic.com\">\"Victor Jara,\" ''All Music Guide'', http://www.allmusic.com (16 January 2007)</ref> His popularity was due not only to his songwriting skills but also to his exceptional power as a performer. He took a decisive turn toward political confrontation with his 1969 song \"Preguntas por Puerto Montt\" (\"Questions About Puerto Montt\"), which took direct aim at a government official who had ordered police to attack squatters in the town of [[Puerto Montt]]. The Chilean political situation deteriorated after the official was assassinated, and right-wing thugs beat up Jara on one occasion.<ref name=\"allmusic.com\" />\n\nIn 1970, Jara supported Allende, the [[Popular Unity (Chile)|Popular Unity]] coalition candidate for president, volunteering for political work and playing free concerts.<ref>Jara, Joan. ''V\u00edctor: An Unfinished Song,''</ref> He composed \"[[Venceremos (song)|Venceremos]]\" (\"We Will Triumph\"), the theme song of Allende's Popular Unity movement, and welcomed Allende's election to the Chilean presidency in 1970. After the election, Jara continued to speak in support of Allende and played an important role in the new administration's efforts to reorient Chilean culture.<ref>Mularski, Jedrek.

Amherst: Cambria Press. {{ISBN|9781604978889}}.</ref>\n\nHe and his wife, [[Joan Jara]], were key participants in a cultural renaissance that swept Chile, organizing cultural events that supported the country's new socialist government. He set poems by Pablo Neruda to music and performed at a ceremony honoring him after Neruda received the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1972. Throughout rumblings of a right-wing coup, Jara held on to his teaching job at [[University of Santiago, Chile#Universidad T\u00e9cnica del Estado|Chile's Technical University]]. His popular success during this time, as both a musician and a Communist, earned him a concert in [[Moscow]]. So successful was he that the Soviet Union tried to latch onto his popularity, claiming in their media that his vocal prowess was the result of surgery he had undergone while in Moscow.<ref>{{Cite book|title = OUR MAN IN CHILE, OR VICTOR JARA'S POSTHUMOUS LIFE IN SOVIET MEDIA AND POPULAR CULTURE|last = Minkova|first = Yuliya|publisher = Virginia Tech|year = 2013|isbn = |location = |pages = 608}}</ref>\n\nBacked by the United States, which opposed Allende's [[socialist]] politics, the Chilean military staged a [[1973 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat on September 11, 1973]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Hitchens |first=Christopher |title=The Trial of Henry Kissinger |year=2001 |publisher=Twelve |location=New York |isbn=978-1455522972 |page=304}}</ref> resulting in the death of Allende and the installation of [[Augusto Pinochet]] as dictator.

The troops prohibited civilians from entering or leaving the university premises. During the afternoon of 12 September 1973, military personnel entered the university and illegally detained hundreds of professors, students, and administrators. V\u00edctor Jara was among those arbitrarily detained on the campus and was subsequently transferred to Chile Stadium, where he was tortured and killed. \n* In the course of transporting and processing the civilian prisoners, Captain Fernando Polanco Gallardo, a commanding officer in military intelligence, recognized Jara as the well-known folk singer whose songs addressed social inequality, and who had supported President Allende's government. Captain Polanco separated Jara from the group and beat him severely.
