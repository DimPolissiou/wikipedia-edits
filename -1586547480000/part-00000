Along with his father, [[Heinrich Parler]], he is one of the most prominent and influential craftsmen of the [[Middle Ages]]. Born and apprenticed in the town of [[Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd]], Peter worked at several important late Medieval building sites, including Strasbourg, Cologne, and Nuremberg. After 1356 he lived in [[Prague]], capital of the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] and seat of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], where he created his most famous works: [[St. Vitus Cathedral]] and the [[Charles Bridge]].\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:M\u00fcnster-GD-Vorderansicht.JPG|thumb|The choir of Holy Cross Minster, [[Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd]], Germany]]\nLittle is known about the earliest youth of Peter Parler. His father, [[Heinrich Parler|Heinrich Parler the Elder]], was a stonemason at [[Cologne Cathedral]]. Around 1333, when Peter was born, Heinrich was invited by the [[free imperial city]] of [[Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd]] to take over construction of a large new parish church, Holy Cross Minster.<ref>Klemm, p. 177</ref> Peter was already working alongside his father on the church when the cornerstone of the [[choir (architecture)|choir]] was laid in 1351. This is presumably also where his apprenticeship was completed. The division of the choir by a continuous balustrade demonstrates what would become his trademark style. The arched section at the southern portal of the church can also be attributed to Peter.<ref>Leiprecht, Helga (1993). [http://www.weller.to/rub/gmuend/gmuend.htm \"Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd: The Oldest Staufer Town\"] (in English). Translated by Craig Sanders. Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd: Clemens Weller. Retrieved 23 Jan 2017.</ref> The designs developed by the father and son team at Holy Cross were unique and mark an important milestone in late Gothic architecture and sculpture.<ref>Pinkus, p. 122</ref>\n\nPeter then set off on the so-called \"[[Journeyman years|Wandering Years]]\" ({{lang-de|Wanderjahre}}), the Medieval German tradition of working as a travelling craftsman after completing apprenticeship. On these visits he learned the most important concepts of Gothic construction techniques in Central Europe. He visited Cologne, perhaps [[Paris]], and certainly spent time in [[Strasbourg]] \u2013 precise knowledge of [[Strasbourg Cathedral]] can be seen in his subsequent buildings.<ref name=\"Baragli, p. 363\">Baragli, p. 363.</ref> While working in Cologne he met Druda (Gertrud), daughter of the resident architect Bartholom\u00e4us von Hamm. They eventually married and had four children: three sons, of which two went on to become known master builders in their own right, and a daughter.<ref name=\"Grueber, p. 275\">Grueber, p. 275.</ref>\n\nWhile undocumented, some scholars believe Parler traveled to [[England in the Late Middle Ages|England]] during this period, while others find the possibility unlikely. The idea arises because certain detailed and concealed technical devices appear in his later work which could have only been obtained through first-hand experience and not from any architectural drawings.<ref>Pekol, Banu (2011).

Retrieved 23 Jan 2017.</ref> What is definitely known is that masons at Strasbourg implemented specific craft methods from western England in the late 1200s, which points to knowledge of [[English Gothic architecture|English Gothic]] architectural methods in the [[Rhineland]].<ref>Wilson, 1992</ref> Since Peter Parler spent time working at Strasbourg, it is much more likely his knowledge of these methods came from there.<ref name=\"Schock-Werner, p. 72\">Schock-Werner, p. 72.</ref> In particular, the vaults he later designed at St. Vitus Cathedral were most probably modeled after the St. Catherine Chapel of Strasbourg Cathedral.<ref>Pekol, 2011</ref>\n\n== Nuremberg ==\n[[File:Nuremberg Frauenkirche edit.jpg|thumb|[[Frauenkirche, Nuremberg]], Germany, where the first sculpture by Peter Parler can be directly identified (1352\u20131356)]] \nSometime after 1352 Peter joined the construction works at the [[Frauenkirche, Nuremberg|Frauenkirche]] in [[Nuremberg]] as the ''parlier'', or chief site assistant alongside his father. The exact date and his precise role are unclear. The foundations of the church had already been laid in 1351 on the initiative of [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor]], who envisioned it as a center for holding imperial ceremonies. This is reflected in the carved [[coats of arms]] of the Emperor, the seven [[Prince-elector]]s, and the city of [[Rome]] where the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s were [[Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|crowned]]. Here the first sculptures can be directly ascribed to Peter, among them a prominent figure of [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zacharias]].<ref name=\"Schock-Werner, p. 72\"/>\n\nCharles also commissioned the building of [[Lauf Castle|Wenzelsburg Castle]] at [[Lauf an der Pegnitz]], near Nuremberg.<ref>Boukal, Jan (2016). [http://charles700.cuni.cz/KARELEN-43.html \"Foundation work of Charles IV.\"] 700th Anniversary of Charles University. Prague. Retrieved 23 Jan 2017.</ref> Built on the ruins of an older castle, its ambitious architecture can be directly connected to the Parlers and Peter probably worked there as a sculptor.<ref name=\"Baragli, p. 363\"/> By 1355 their sophisticated style had come to the attention of Charles IV and Peter was called to work in Prague, the capitol of the new Kingdom of Bohemia and seat of the Emperor. The year of this appointment is not entirely clear since the documentary inscription in Prague was partially painted over in the 15th century. Today research usually sets the date to 1356,<ref>Schmidt, 1970</ref> which accounts for a pause in construction in both Nuremberg and Prague, as well as information that he was at least 23 years old at the time of his appointment.<ref name=\"Schock-Werner, p. 72\"/>\n\n== Prague ==\n[[File:St Vitus Prague September 2016-2.jpg|thumb|Interior of St. Vitus Cathedral, clearly showing the Parler-style balustrade]]\n{{Main article|History of Prague#Renaissance}}\nUpon his ascension to the throne as [[King of Bohemia]] in 1347, Charles IV established his capital at Prague. At the time it consisted of two autonomous Medieval towns on each side of the [[Vltava river]] ({{lang-de|Moldau}}): the [[Old Town (Prague)|Old Town]] on the right and the [[Mal\u00e1 Strana]] with [[Prague Castle]] above it on the left. In 1348 he ordered construction of the [[New Town, Prague|New Town]] adjacent to the existing [[Old Town (Prague)|Old Town]], founded [[Charles University]], began reconstruction of the castle, and restarted work on the cathedral. To accomplish this ambitious building program he recruited the best architects he could find. First was [[Matthias of Arras]], who died in 1352. When elected [[Holy Roman Emperor]] in 1355, Charles determined to make Prague the showcase capital of [[Central Europe]] and recruited Peter Parler to execute this grand vision. The period would launch what became known as Prague's \"golden era\" and it soon was the largest European city after [[Constantinople]], [[Paris]], and [[Granada]].<ref>Blau, p. 47.</ref>\n\n=== St. Vitus Cathedral ===\n{{Main article|St. Vitus Cathedral}}\nWhen Peter arrived in Prague in 1356 at the age of 23, his immediate assignment was to take over the construction site at St. Vitus Cathedral, which had languished since the death of Matthias of Arras in 1352. It is indicative of Peter's talents that the most important building in the Empire was then entrusted to such a young architect.<ref name=\"Baragli, p. 363\"/><ref name=\"Bork, p. 201\">Bork, p. 201.</ref> Peter continued the works at St. Vitus from the ambulatory and chapels, which were partially complete, and gradually changed the Matthias plan while keeping continual references to the original vision.<ref name=\"Schock-Werner, p. 72\"/>\n\n=== Charles Bridge ===\n[[File:Prague 07-2016 View from Petrinska Tower img2.jpg|thumb|Charles Bridge and the Old Town Bridge Tower]]\n{{Main article|Charles Bridge}}\nIn 1342, just prior to the reign of Charles IV, the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] Judith Bridge across the Vltava was severely damaged in a flood. It had been the first stone bridge to connect each bank of the river. In 1357, Charles commissioned Peter to build a new structure to reconnect the growing city, now consisting of 4 districts. The first foundation stone was ceremonially laid in the presence of the Emperor on 9 July 1357 at 5:31 am. The exact time is known because the architect had the [[palindromic number]] 135797531 carved into the bridge's tower, having been chosen by the royal astrologists as the most auspicious for starting construction. Due to the complexity of the engineering project, and the large number of other projects underway, construction lasted until 1402.<ref>Blau, p. 46</ref>\n\nThe east tower of the Bridge, Old Town Bridge Tower, was also built by Peter Parler. Its arch contains a [[net vault]] that was the first of its kind in Bohemia.<ref>Gajdosova, Jana (2015).

He also built the ''All Saints' Chapel'' inside the Royal Palace of Prague Castle. After a fire in 1541 it was redecorated in the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style. Between 1360\u201378 Parler built the chancel of the [[Bartholomew the Apostle|St. Bartholomew]] church in [[Kol\u00edn]]. Peter is also responsible for various tombs, shrines and sculptures at various sites in and around Prague, including at [[Kutn\u00e1 Hora]].<ref>Curl, Wilson. p. 551</ref>\n\n== Family and personal life ==\n[[File:Petr Parler nahrdeska.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Peter Parler in St. Vitus Cathedral]]\nThe [[Parler family]] grew large and its many members worked at Gothic construction sites all over [[Central Europe]] and [[Northern Italy]]. Peter's branch of the family began with his marriage to his first wife, Gertrude. Although their wedding date is not exactly known, by 1360 they were raising three sons and a daughter:\n\n* [[Johann Parler|Johann Parler the Younger]]: born around 1359, educated in Prague, worked alongside his father on St. Vitus.

He then went on to become master stonemason at [[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna]].<ref>Schock-Werner, p. 69.</ref> \n* Their daughter appears around 1383 as the wife of a Michael from Cologne, possibly the son of another cathedral architect named Michael (1364\u20131387).<ref name=\"Grueber, p. 275\"/>\n\nAfter 1360, Peter owned a house in [[St. George's Square (Prague Castle)|Prague Castle Square]] and had been elected city alderman. His first wife Gertrude died in the late 1360s and he returned to Cologne to dispose of her inheritance in 1370. He then married Elisabeth Agnes von Bur in 1380 and in the same year bought a second house on Castle Square. From this marriage two more children were born: Johann, who possibly became a stonemason in [[Zagreb]]; and Paul, about whom no information survives.<ref>Schock-Werner, p. 70.</ref> He may have had other children as well.<ref name=\"Grueber, p. 275\"/> The purchase of the houses, the marriage of his daughter, and the number of his children led to some legal disputes. Peter Parler is known to have relinquished both houses to his second wife and their children.<ref>Neuwirth, p. 7.</ref>\n\nPeter was granted citizenship in Prague in 1379.<ref name=\"Baragli, p. 363\"/> By his old age he had become a wealthy man and was still active as an architect. His name appears as Cathedral Master ({{lang-de|Dombaumeister}}) on a panel at St. Vitus as late as 1396.<ref>Grueber, p. 279.</ref> He died in Prague in 1399 and was buried at St. Vitus Cathedral, with his sons Peter and Wenzel carrying on his work.\n\n==Legacy==\nPeter Parler was one of the most well-known and influential craftsman of the Middle Ages.<ref name=\"Bork, p. 201\"/><ref>Curl/Wilson, p. 551</ref> The designs of both him and his father became known as the \"Parler style\" and spread throughout Central Europe.

Along with his father, [[Heinrich Parler]], he is one of the most prominent and influential craftsmen of the [[Middle Ages]]. Born and apprenticed in the town of [[Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd]], Peter worked at several important late Medieval building sites, including Strasbourg, Cologne, and Nuremberg. After 1356 he lived in [[Prague]], capital of the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] and seat of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], where he created his most famous works: [[St. Vitus Cathedral]] and the [[Charles Bridge]].\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:M\u00fcnster-GD-Vorderansicht.JPG|thumb|The choir of Holy Cross Minster, [[Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd]], Germany]]\nLittle is known about the earliest youth of Peter Parler. His father, [[Heinrich Parler|Heinrich Parler the Elder]], was a stonemason at [[Cologne Cathedral]]. Around 1333, when Peter was born, Heinrich was invited by the [[free imperial city]] of [[Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd]] to take over construction of a large new parish church, Holy Cross Minster.<ref>Klemm, p. 177</ref> Peter was already working alongside his father on the church when the cornerstone of the [[choir (architecture)|choir]] was laid in 1351. This is presumably also where his apprenticeship was completed. The division of the choir by a continuous balustrade demonstrates what would become his trademark style. The arched section at the southern portal of the church can also be attributed to Peter.<ref>Leiprecht, Helga (1993). [http://www.weller.to/rub/gmuend/gmuend.htm \"Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd: The Oldest Staufer Town\"] (in English). Translated by Craig Sanders. Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd: Clemens Weller. Retrieved 23 Jan 2017.</ref> The designs developed by the father and son team at Holy Cross were unique and mark an important milestone in late Gothic architecture and sculpture.<ref>Pinkus, p. 122</ref>\n\nPeter then set off on the so-called \"[[Journeyman years|Wandering Years]]\" ({{lang-de|Wanderjahre}}), the Medieval German tradition of working as a travelling craftsman after completing apprenticeship. On these visits he learned the most important concepts of Gothic construction techniques in Central Europe. He visited Cologne, perhaps [[Paris]], and certainly spent time in [[Strasbourg]] \u2013 precise knowledge of [[Strasbourg Cathedral]] can be seen in his subsequent buildings.<ref name=\"Baragli, p. 363\">Baragli, p. 363.</ref> While working in Cologne he met Druda (Gertrud), daughter of the resident architect Bartholom\u00e4us von Hamm. They eventually married and had four children: three sons, of which two went on to become known master builders in their own right, and a daughter.<ref name=\"Grueber, p. 275\">Grueber, p. 275.</ref>\n\nWhile undocumented, some scholars believe Parler traveled to [[England in the Late Middle Ages|England]] during this period, while others find the possibility unlikely. The idea arises because certain detailed and concealed technical devices appear in his later work which could have only been obtained though first-hand experience and not from any architectural drawings.<ref>Pekol, Banu (2011).

Retrieved 23 Jan 2017.</ref> What is definitely known is that masons at Strasbourg implemented specific craft methods from western England in the late 1200s, which points to knowledge of [[English Gothic architecture|English Gothic]] architectural methods in the [[Rhineland]].<ref>Wilson, 1992</ref> Since Peter Parler spent time working at Strasbourg, it is much more likely his knowledge of these methods came from there.<ref name=\"Schock-Werner, p. 72\">Schock-Werner, p. 72.</ref> In particular, the vaults he later designed at St. Vitus Cathedral were most probably modeled after the St. Catherine Chapel of Strasbourg Cathedral.<ref>Pekol, 2011</ref>\n\n== Nuremberg ==\n[[File:Nuremberg Frauenkirche edit.jpg|thumb|[[Frauenkirche, Nuremberg]], Germany, where the first sculpture by Peter Parler can be directly identified (1352\u20131356)]] \nSometime after 1352 Peter joined the construction works at the [[Frauenkirche, Nuremberg|Frauenkirche]] in [[Nuremberg]] as the ''parlier'', or chief site assistant alongside his father. The exact date and his precise role are unclear. The foundations of the church had already been laid in 1351 on the initiative of [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor]], who envisioned it as a center for holding imperial ceremonies. This is reflected in the carved [[coats of arms]] of the Emperor, the seven [[Prince-elector]]s, and the city of [[Rome]] where the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s were [[Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|crowned]]. Here the first sculptures can be directly ascribed to Peter, among them a prominent figure of [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zacharias]].<ref name=\"Schock-Werner, p. 72\"/>\n\nCharles also commissioned the building of [[Lauf Castle|Wenzelsburg Castle]] at [[Lauf an der Pegnitz]], near Nuremberg.<ref>Boukal, Jan (2016). [http://charles700.cuni.cz/KARELEN-43.html \"Foundation work of Charles IV.\"] 700th Anniversary of Charles University. Prague. Retrieved 23 Jan 2017.</ref> Built on the ruins of an older castle, its ambitious architecture can be directly connected to the Parlers and Peter probably worked there as a sculptor.<ref name=\"Baragli, p. 363\"/> By 1355 their sophisticated style had come to the attention of Charles IV and Peter was called to work in Prague, the capitol of the new Kingdom of Bohemia and seat of the Emperor. The year of this appointment is not entirely clear since the documentary inscription in Prague was partially painted over in the 15th century. Today research usually sets the date to 1356,<ref>Schmidt, 1970</ref> which accounts for a pause in construction in both Nuremberg and Prague, as well as information that he was at least 23 years old at the time of his appointment.<ref name=\"Schock-Werner, p. 72\"/>\n\n== Prague ==\n[[File:St Vitus Prague September 2016-2.jpg|thumb|Interior of St. Vitus Cathedral, clearly showing the Parler-style balustrade]]\n{{Main article|History of Prague#Renaissance}}\nUpon his ascension to the throne as [[King of Bohemia]] in 1347, Charles IV established his capital at Prague. At the time it consisted of two autonomous Medieval towns on each side of the [[Vltava river]] ({{lang-de|Moldau}}): the [[Old Town (Prague)|Old Town]] on the right and the [[Mal\u00e1 Strana]] with [[Prague Castle]] above it on the left. In 1348 he ordered construction of the [[New Town, Prague|New Town]] adjacent to the existing [[Old Town (Prague)|Old Town]], founded [[Charles University]], began reconstruction of the castle, and restarted work on the cathedral. To accomplish this ambitious building program he recruited the best architects he could find. First was [[Matthias of Arras]], who died in 1352. When elected [[Holy Roman Emperor]] in 1355, Charles determined to make Prague the showcase capital of [[Central Europe]] and recruited Peter Parler to execute this grand vision. The period would launch what became known as Prague's \"golden era\" and it soon was the largest European city after [[Constantinople]], [[Paris]], and [[Granada]].<ref>Blau, p. 47.</ref>\n\n=== St. Vitus Cathedral ===\n{{Main article|St. Vitus Cathedral}}\nWhen Peter arrived in Prague in 1356 at the age of 23, his immediate assignment was to take over the construction site at St. Vitus Cathedral, which had languished since the death of Matthias of Arras in 1352. It is indicative of Peter's talents that the most important building in the Empire was then entrusted to such a young architect.<ref name=\"Baragli, p. 363\"/><ref name=\"Bork, p. 201\">Bork, p. 201.</ref> Peter continued the works at St. Vitus from the ambulatory and chapels, which were partially complete, and gradually changed the Matthias plan while keeping continual references to the original vision.<ref name=\"Schock-Werner, p. 72\"/>\n\n=== Charles Bridge ===\n[[File:Prague 07-2016 View from Petrinska Tower img2.jpg|thumb|Charles Bridge and the Old Town Bridge Tower]]\n{{Main article|Charles Bridge}}\nIn 1342, just prior to the reign of Charles IV, the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] Judith Bridge across the Vltava was severely damaged in a flood. It had been the first stone bridge to connect each bank of the river. In 1357, Charles commissioned Peter to build a new structure to reconnect the growing city, now consisting of 4 districts. The first foundation stone was ceremonially laid in the presence of the Emperor on 9 July 1357 at 5:31 am. The exact time is known because the architect had the [[palindromic number]] 135797531 carved into the bridge's tower, having been chosen by the royal astrologists as the most auspicious for starting construction. Due to the complexity of the engineering project, and the large number of other projects underway, construction lasted until 1402.<ref>Blau, p. 46</ref>\n\nThe east tower of the Bridge, Old Town Bridge Tower, was also built by Peter Parler. Its arch contains a [[net vault]] that was the first of its kind in Bohemia.<ref>Gajdosova, Jana (2015).

Retrieved 24 Jan 2017.</ref>\n\n=== Other Works ===\nApart from the cathedral and the bridge, Peter was also the main designer of the [[New Town, Prague|New Town of Prague]]. He also built the ''All Saints' Chapel'' inside the Royal Palace of Prague Castle. After a fire in 1541 it was redecorated in the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style. Between 1360\u201378 Parler built the chancel of the [[Bartholomew the Apostle|St. Bartholomew]] church in [[Kol\u00edn]]. Peter is also responsible for various tombs, shrines and sculptures at various sites in and around Prague, including at [[Kutn\u00e1 Hora]].<ref>Curl, Wilson. p. 551</ref>\n\n== Family and personal life ==\n[[File:Petr Parler nahrdeska.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Peter Parler in St. Vitus Cathedral]]\nThe [[Parler family]] grew large and its many members worked at Gothic construction sites all over [[Central Europe]] and [[Northern Italy]]. Peter's branch of the family began with his marriage to his first wife, Gertrude. Although their wedding date is not exactly known, by 1360 they were raising three sons and a daughter:\n\n* [[Johann Parler|Johann Parler the Younger]]: born around 1359, educated in Prague, worked alongside his father on St. Vitus.

He then went on to become master stonemason at [[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna]].<ref>Schock-Werner, p. 69.</ref> \n* Their daughter appears around 1383 as the wife of a Michael from Cologne, possibly the son of another cathedral architect named Michael (1364\u20131387).<ref name=\"Grueber, p. 275\"/>\n\nAfter 1360, Peter owned a house in [[St. George's Square (Prague Castle)|Prague Castle Square]] and had been elected city alderman. His first wife Gertrude died in the late 1360s and he returned to Cologne to dispose of her inheritance in 1370. He then married Elisabeth Agnes von Bur in 1380 and in the same year bought a second house on Castle Square. From this marriage two more children were born: Johann, who possibly became a stonemason in [[Zagreb]]; and Paul, about whom no information survives.<ref>Schock-Werner, p. 70.</ref> He may have had other children as well.<ref name=\"Grueber, p. 275\"/> The purchase of the houses, the marriage of his daughter, and the number of his children led to some legal disputes. Peter Parler is known to have relinquished both houses to his second wife and their children.<ref>Neuwirth, p. 7.</ref>\n\nPeter was granted citizenship in Prague in 1379.<ref name=\"Baragli, p. 363\"/> By his old age he had become a wealthy man and was still active as an architect. His name appears as Cathedral Master ({{lang-de|Dombaumeister}}) on a panel at St. Vitus as late as 1396.<ref>Grueber, p. 279.</ref> He died in Prague in 1399 and was buried at St. Vitus Cathedral, with his sons Peter and Wenzel carrying on his work.\n\n==Legacy==\nPeter Parler was one of the most well-known and influential craftsman of the Middle Ages.<ref name=\"Bork, p. 201\"/><ref>Curl/Wilson, p. 551</ref> The designs of both him and his father became known as the \"Parler style\" and spread throughout Central Europe. Significant examples include: [[St. Martin's Church, Landshut]] (begun 1389); [[St. Lorenz, Nuremberg]] (nave begun 1400); St. George's Minster, [[Dinkelsb\u00fchl]] (begun 1448); [[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna]] (south tower begun 1368); and numerous other examples across the [[Hanseatic League]] from the [[Netherlands]] to [[Poland]]. Examples can also be found in [[Scandinavia]], such as at St. Mary's, [[Helsing\u00f8r]], [[Denmark]].<ref>Yarwood, p. 92.</ref>\n\nA demonstration of just how far his ideas went can be found at [[Seville Cathedral]], begun in 1402 and today still the largest Gothic cathedral in the world.<ref>{{cite web |last=Quintero |first=Josephine |url=http://www.andalucia.com/cities/seville/cathedral.htm |title=Seville Cathedral, The City of Seville main sights, Andalucia, Southern Spain |publisher=Andalucia.com |date= |accessdate=23 Jan 2017}}</ref> The standard Gothic verticality of the central space is broken up by a [[balustrade]] at the boundary with the [[clerestory]] windows.

The Kahal leaders viewed Hasidism as a movement that threatened the social order and their economic and social standing; the leaders presented the Vilna Gaon with false evidence, thus inciting him to lash out at the Hasidim.
