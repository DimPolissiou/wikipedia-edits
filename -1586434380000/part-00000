He made his senior debut for [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in 2017 and in the same year helped his nation claim the [[2017 FIFA Confederations Cup]] where his return of three goals earned him the tournament's Golden Boot award.\n\n==Club career==\n===VfB Stuttgart===\nAn academy graduate of [[VfB Stuttgart]], Werner represented the club at various youth levels.

His notable films include ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961), ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), ''[[Jacqueline Susann's Once Is Not Enough (film)|Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975), ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' (1979), ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade]]'' (1981), ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' (1990), ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1991), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), ''[[Hollywood Ending]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Congressman]]'' (2016). For his debut performance in ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), Hamilton won a [[Golden Globe Award]] and was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award]]. He has received one additional BAFTA nomination and two additional Golden Globe nominations.\n\nHamilton began his film career in 1958 and although he has a substantial body of work in film and television he is, perhaps, most famous for his debonair style and his perpetual suntan. [[Bo Derek]] writes in her autobiography that \"there was an ongoing contest between [[John Derek|John]] [Derek] and George Hamilton as to who was tanner\".<ref>Derek, Bo (with Mark Seal) (2002), ''Riding Lessons: Everything That Matters in Life I Learned from Horses'', ReganBooks HarperCollins, {{ISBN|0060394374}}, p.212</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nHamilton was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], the middle of three boys with an older maternal half brother and a younger full brother, and lived in [[Blytheville, Arkansas]]. He is the eldest son of bandleader [[George Hamilton (musician)|George \"Spike\" Hamilton]].<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/43/George-Hamilton.html George Hamilton Biography (1939\u2013)<!-- Bot generated title -->] from filmreference.com</ref>\n\nHis stepfathers were Carleton Hunt and Jesse Spalding; his stepmother was June Howard, with whom Hamilton said he had an affair when he was 12 years old which was shortly after she married his father.<ref>Beifuss, John.

November 4, 2008</ref>\n\nHamilton attended the [[Hackley School]] in [[Tarrytown, New York]], graduating in 1957.<ref name=\"PAGESIX\">Burroni, Christine, [https://pagesix.com/20George Hamilton reminisces about his high school days\"], ''pagesix.com'', October 21, 2017</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Early appearances===\nHamilton's first roles were in TV. He appeared on such shows as ''[[The Veil (TV series)|The Veil]]'' (playing an Indian), ''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'' and ''[[Cimarron City]]''.\n\nHis first film role was a lead, ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), directed by [[Denis Sanders]]. Although shot in 1958 it was not released until the following year.\n\nHowever the film was seen by [[Vincente Minnelli]] who thought Hamilton would be ideal for the younger son in ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), a Southern melodrama with [[Robert Mitchum]]. Hamilton was duly cast and the film was popular. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] signed him to a long-term contract.\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nMGM cast Hamilton in support of [[Natalie Wood]] and [[Robert Wagner]] in the melodrama ''[[All the Fine Young Cannibals]]'' (1960) which flopped at the box office.\n\nHamilton's next film was far more popular, the beach party comedy ''[[Where the Boys Are]]'' (1960). This was a hit and remains one of his best known movies.\n\nHamilton wanted to do more serious material, however, so he appeared in the lower budgeted ''[[Angel Baby (1961 film)|Angel Baby]]'' (1961), a drama about an evangelist, for [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]]. It had minimal commercial or critical impact. For [[United Artists]] he supported [[Lana Turner]] in a melodrama, ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961).\n\nMGM tried to change his image by putting him in a Western, ''[[A Thunder of Drums]]'' (1961) alongside [[Richard Boone]]; the film was mildly popular.\n\nHamilton lobbied hard for the role of the Italian husband in ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), another melodrama, with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. The film lost money but Hamilton received excellent notices. It was shot in Italy, and MGM kept Hamilton in that country to play a role in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]'' (1962), an unsuccessful attempt to repeat the success of ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952).\n\nHamilton had an excellent part in ''[[The Victors (film)|The Victors]]'' (1963), an anti-war drama from [[Carl Foreman]]. It was a box office disappointment but was critically acclaimed. Hamilton had another good role in ''[[Act One (film)|Act One]]'' (1963), playing [[Moss Hart]], but the movie was poorly received. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'' and ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]''.\n\nAfter making a cameo in ''[[Looking for Love (film)|Looking for Love]]'' (1964), Hamilton appeared in another biopic, ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), playing [[Hank Williams]]. The movie was not widely seen but had its fans and Hamilton's performance received some praise. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[The Rogues (TV series)|The Rogues]]'' and ''[[Ben Casey]]''.\n\nHamilton went to Mexico to support [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]] in ''[[Viva Maria!]]'' (1965). It was directed by [[Louis Malle]] who cast Hamilton on the strength of his performance in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]''. Malle said \"he was a personal choice and I am happy with him.... He's more interested in being in the social columns&nbsp;\u2013 I don't understand&nbsp;\u2013 when he should be one of the greatest of his generation.\"<ref>He Blunted U.S. Blue Pencil Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times (June 29, 1965: C8</ref> The film was hugely popular in Europe, but did not break through to the US.\n\nHamilton made a movie in France, ''[[That Man George]]'' (1965) and appeared in a production of ''[[A Farewell to Arms (miniseries)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1966) on TV, opposite [[Vanessa Redgrave]].\n\nHe returned to MGM to make a romantic comedy with [[Sandra Dee]], ''[[Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding!]]'' (1967), which was mildly popular. At Columbia he co-starred with [[Glenn Ford]] in a Western ''[[A Time for Killing]]'' (1967), originally directed by [[Roger Corman]] then [[Phil Karlson]].\n\nHamilton played a cat burglar in MGM's ''[[Jack of Diamonds (1967 film)|Jack of Diamonds]]'' (1967). It was produced by Sandy Howard who said Hamilton was \"a hot commodity these days\" because he was dating [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s daughter.<ref>Lynda Johnson Gets A Job at McCall's: LYNDA BIRD GETS A JOB AT M'CALL'S By TERENCE SMITH.

He portrayed a trouble shooter for the US State Department in Paris helping US citizens. This series was canceled in March 1970.\n\nHe starred in the TV films ''[[Togetherness (film)|Togetherness]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'', a 1971 compilation of two episodes of ''[[Harold Robbins' The Survivors]]''.\n\n===Producer===\nHamilton decided to move into producing to give himself greater control over his career. He produced and played the title role in ''[[Evel Knievel (1971 film)|Evel Knievel]]'' (1971). Hamilton had the script rewritten by [[John Milius]] who later called Hamilton \"a wonderful guy, totally underrated. A great con-man, that's what he really is. He always said, 'I'll be remembered as a third-rate actor when in fact, I'm a first-rate con man'.\"<ref name=\"nat\">Segaloff, Nat, \"John Milius: The Good Fights\", ''Backstory 4: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s'', Ed. [[Patrick McGilligan (biographer)|Patrick McGilligan]], Uni of California 2006 p 289</ref>\n\nHe appeared in a TV movie, ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'' (1973), and had a support role as a wealthy rancher whose wife was trying to leave him in the western, ''[[The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing (film)|The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing]]'', starring [[Burt Reynolds]] (1973).\n\nHe produced and appeared in ''[[Medusa (1973 film)|Medusa]]'' (1973). He starred in the TV movie ''[[The Dead Don't Die (1975 film)|The Dead Don't Die]]'' (1975) and had a support role in ''[[Jacqueline Susann's Once Is Not Enough (film)|Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975). On a 1975 episode of ''[[Columbo]]'', Hamilton played a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to commit a murder, whose arrogant assertions in his own defence establish that he was in fact at the scene of the crime. \n\nHamilton guest starred on episodes of ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', ''[[The Eddie Capra Mysteries]]'', ''[[Gibbsville (TV series)|Gibbsville]]'', ''[[Supertrain]]'', and ''[[Sword of Justice (TV series)|Sword of Justice]]''.\n\nHe had support roles in ''[[The Strange Possession of Mrs. Oliver]]'' (1977), ''[[The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington]]'' (1977), ''[[Killer on Board]]'' (1977), ''[[Sextette]]'' (1978), ''[[The Users (film)|The Users]]'' (1978), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979), ''[[Institute for Revenge]]'' (1979), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979) and ''[[Death Car on the Freeway]]'' (1979).\n\n===''Love at First Bite''===\nA surprise blockbuster hit came his way in 1979 when Hamilton showed a flair for comedy in ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' which was the story of [[Count Dracula]]'s pursuit of a young Manhattanite model, played by [[Susan Saint James]]. The movie included such scenes as Dracula and his conquest dancing to \"[[I Love the Nightlife]]\" at a disco. The film's box-office success created a popularity surge for Hamilton, who also served as executive producer.\n\nHe returned to TV for ''[[The Seekers (miniseries)|The Seekers]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Great Cash Giveaway Getaway]]'' (1979) then he did a ''Love at First Bite'' style comedy, 1981's ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade]]'', which he produced.\n\nHowever, ''Zorro'' was not as popular as ''Love at First Bite'' and film leads dried up quickly. He focused on television: ''[[Malibu (film)|Malibu]]'' (1983) and ''[[Two Fathers' Justice]]'' (1985).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Hamilton starred in the sixth season of the ABC [[Aaron Spelling]]-produced nighttime television serial ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''.\n\nHe supported [[Joan Collins]] in the miniseries ''[[Monte Carlo (miniseries)|Monte Carlo]]'' (1986) and had the lead in a short lived series ''[[Spies (TV series)|Spies]]'' (1987).  He supported [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in ''[[Poker Alice (film)|Poker Alice]]'' (1987).\n\n===1990s===\nA break for Hamilton came in 1990 when [[Francis Ford Coppola]] cast him as the Corleone family's lawyer in a much-anticipated film, ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.\n\nFor the second time, he portrayed a murderer on the television series ''[[Columbo]]'', starring as the host of a TV true-crime show in the 1991 episode \"[[List of Columbo episodes|Caution: Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health]].\" He had previously been in the 1975 episode \"A Deadly State of Mind\".\n\nHamilton had small roles in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1991), ''[[Once Upon a Crime]]'' (1992) and ''[[Amore! (1993 film)|Amore!]]'' (1993) and guest starred on ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]]'' and ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]''. He went to Germany to make ''[[Das Paradies am Ende der Berge]]'' (1993) and did ''[[Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent]]'' (1994), ''[[Vanished (1995 film)|Vanished]]'' (1995), and ''[[Playback (1996 film)|Playback]]'' (1996), as well as guest starring on shows like ''[[Bonnie (TV series)|Bonnie]]'', ''[[Hart to Hart]]'' and ''The Guilt''.\n\nHe was in ''[[Meet Wally Sparks]]'' (1997), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), and ''[[Rough Riders (miniseries)|Rough Riders]]'' (1997). With his matinee-idol looks it was sometimes noted that Hamilton physically resembled [[Warren Beatty]]. Beatty's political satire ''[[Bulworth]]'' (1998) contained a running gag about this with Hamilton appearing as himself in a brief cameo. Hamilton had a regular role on the short lived TV series ''[[Jenny (TV series)|Jenny]]'' (1997).\n\nHe was in ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]'' (1998), ''[[P.T. Barnum (film)|P.T. Barnum]]'' (1999) and ''[[She's Too Tall]]'' (1999). He was a semi-regular celebrity guest on the 1998-99 syndicated version of ''[[Match Game]]''\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003, Hamilton hosted ''[[The Family (U.S. TV series)|The Family]]'' which was a reality television series on ABC for one season. The program starred ten members from a traditional Italian-American family, each fighting for a $1,000,000 prize. In 2006, Hamilton competed in the second season of ABC's ''Dancing with the Stars''<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancing/ Dancing With The Stars]&nbsp;\u2013 ABC.com</ref> with professional [[Edyta Sliwinska]] in which they lasted until the sixth round. At age 66 and recovering from knee injuries, Hamilton, unable to match the limber dance moves of his younger competitors, charmed the audience and judges with endearingly silly dances utilizing props including a [[Zorro]] mask and the sword from ''Zorro, The Gay Blade''.\n\nIn 2006, it was rumored that Hamilton would replace [[Bob Barker]] on ''[[The Price Is Right (American game show)|The Price Is Right]]''. He auditioned for the show and in March 2007, [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] reported that Hamilton was a frontrunner to replace Barker. According to [[Reuters]], Hamilton was one of the final three contenders to host the show, alongside [[Mark Steines]] and [[Todd Newton]].<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSN1624240720070416 Trio remaining in Price line] from Reuters</ref> Soon thereafter, however, [[Drew Carey]] was named as Barker's successor.

For his debut performance in ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), Hamilton won a [[Golden Globe Award]] and was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award]]. He has received one additional BAFTA nomination and two additional Golden Globe nominations.\n\nHamilton began his film career in 1958 and although he has a substantial body of work in film and television he is, perhaps, most famous for his debonair style and his perpetual suntan.

He appeared on such shows as ''[[The Veil (TV series)|The Veil]]'' (playing an Indian), ''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'' and ''[[Cimarron City]]''.\n\nHis first film role was a lead, ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), directed by [[Denis Sanders]]. Although shot in 1958 it was not released until the following year.\n\nHowever the film was seen by [[Vincente Minnelli]] who thought Hamilton would be ideal for the younger son in ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), a Southern melodrama with [[Robert Mitchum]]. Hamilton was duly cast and the film was popular. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] signed him to a long-term contract.\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nMGM cast Hamilton in support of [[Natalie Wood]] and [[Robert Wagner]] in the melodrama ''[[All the Fine Young Cannibals]]'' (1960) which flopped at the box office.\n\nHamilton's next film was far more popular, the beach party comedy ''[[Where the Boys Are]]'' (1960). This was a hit and remains one of his best known movies.\n\nHamilton wanted to do more serious material, however, so he appeared in the lower budgeted ''[[Angel Baby (1961 film)|Angel Baby]]'' (1961), a drama about an evangelist, for [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]]. It had minimal commercial or critical impact. For [[United Artists]] he supported [[Lana Turner]] in a melodrama, ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961).\n\nMGM tried to change his image by putting him in a Western, ''[[A Thunder of Drums]]'' (1961) alongside [[Richard Boone]]; the film was mildly popular.\n\nHamilton lobbied hard for the role of the Italian husband in ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), another melodrama, with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. The film lost money but Hamilton received excellent notices. It was shot in Italy, and MGM kept Hamilton in that country to play a role in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]'' (1962), an unsuccessful attempt to repeat the success of ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952).\n\nHamilton had an excellent part in ''[[The Victors (film)|The Victors]]'' (1963), an anti-war drama from [[Carl Foreman]]. It was a box office disappointment but was critically acclaimed. Hamilton had another good role in ''[[Act One (film)|Act One]]'' (1963), playing [[Moss Hart]], but the movie was poorly received. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'' and ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]''.\n\nAfter making a cameo in ''[[Looking for Love (film)|Looking for Love]]'' (1964), Hamilton appeared in another biopic, ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), playing [[Hank Williams]]. The movie was not widely seen but had its fans and Hamilton's performance received some praise. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[The Rogues (TV series)|The Rogues]]'' and ''[[Ben Casey]]''.\n\nHamilton went to Mexico to support [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]] in ''[[Viva Maria!]]'' (1965). It was directed by [[Louis Malle]] who cast Hamilton on the strength of his performance in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]''. Malle said \"he was a personal choice and I am happy with him.... He's more interested in being in the social columns&nbsp;\u2013 I don't understand&nbsp;\u2013 when he should be one of the greatest of his generation.\"<ref>He Blunted U.S. Blue Pencil Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times (June 29, 1965: C8</ref> The film was hugely popular in Europe, but did not break through to the US.\n\nHamilton made a movie in France, ''[[That Man George]]'' (1965) and appeared in a production of ''[[A Farewell to Arms (miniseries)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1966) on TV, opposite [[Vanessa Redgrave]].\n\nHe returned to MGM to make a romantic comedy with [[Sandra Dee]], ''[[Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding!]]'' (1967), which was mildly popular. At Columbia he co-starred with [[Glenn Ford]] in a Western ''[[A Time for Killing]]'' (1967), originally directed by [[Roger Corman]] then [[Phil Karlson]].\n\nHamilton played a cat burglar in MGM's ''[[Jack of Diamonds (1967 film)|Jack of Diamonds]]'' (1967). It was produced by Sandy Howard who said Hamilton was \"a hot commodity these days\" because he was dating [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s daughter.<ref>Lynda Johnson Gets A Job at McCall's: LYNDA BIRD GETS A JOB AT M'CALL'S By TERENCE SMITH.

He portrayed a trouble shooter for the US State Department in Paris helping US citizens. This series was canceled in March 1970.\n\nHe starred in the TV films ''[[Togetherness (film)|Togetherness]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'', a 1971 compilation of two episodes of ''[[Harold Robbins' The Survivors]]''.\n\n===Producer===\nHamilton decided to move into producing to give himself greater control over his career. He produced and played the title role in ''[[Evel Knievel (1971 film)|Evel Knievel]]'' (1971). Hamilton had the script rewritten by [[John Milius]] who later called Hamilton \"a wonderful guy, totally underrated. A great con-man, that's what he really is. He always said, 'I'll be remembered as a third-rate actor when in fact, I'm a first-rate con man'.\"<ref name=\"nat\">Segaloff, Nat, \"John Milius: The Good Fights\", ''Backstory 4: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s'', Ed. [[Patrick McGilligan (biographer)|Patrick McGilligan]], Uni of California 2006 p 289</ref>\n\nHe appeared in a TV movie, ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'' (1973), and had a support role as a wealthy rancher whose wife was trying to leave him in the western, ''[[The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing (film)|The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing]]'', starring [[Burt Reynolds]] (1973).\n\nHe produced and appeared in ''[[Medusa (1973 film)|Medusa]]'' (1973). He starred in the TV movie ''[[The Dead Don't Die (1975 film)|The Dead Don't Die]]'' (1975) and had a support role in ''[[Jacqueline Susann's Once Is Not Enough (film)|Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975). On a 1975 episode of ''[[Columbo]]'', Hamilton played a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to commit a murder, whose arrogant assertions in his own defence establish that he was in fact at the scene of the crime. \n\nHamilton guest starred on episodes of ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', ''[[The Eddie Capra Mysteries]]'', ''[[Gibbsville (TV series)|Gibbsville]]'', ''[[Supertrain]]'', and ''[[Sword of Justice (TV series)|Sword of Justice]]''.\n\nHe had support roles in ''[[The Strange Possession of Mrs. Oliver]]'' (1977), ''[[The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington]]'' (1977), ''[[Killer on Board]]'' (1977), ''[[Sextette]]'' (1978), ''[[The Users (film)|The Users]]'' (1978), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979), ''[[Institute for Revenge]]'' (1979), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979) and ''[[Death Car on the Freeway]]'' (1979).\n\n===''Love at First Bite''===\nA surprise blockbuster hit came his way in 1979 when Hamilton showed a flair for comedy in ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' which was the story of [[Count Dracula]]'s pursuit of a young Manhattanite model, played by [[Susan Saint James]]. The movie included such scenes as Dracula and his conquest dancing to \"[[I Love the Nightlife]]\" at a disco. The film's box-office success created a popularity surge for Hamilton, who also served as executive producer.\n\nHe returned to TV for ''[[The Seekers (miniseries)|The Seekers]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Great Cash Giveaway Getaway]]'' (1979) then he did a ''Love at First Bite'' style comedy, 1981's ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade]]'', which he produced.\n\nHowever, ''Zorro'' was not as popular as ''Love at First Bite'' and film leads dried up quickly. He focused on television: ''[[Malibu (film)|Malibu]]'' (1983) and ''[[Two Fathers' Justice]]'' (1985).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Hamilton starred in the sixth season of the ABC [[Aaron Spelling]]-produced nighttime television serial ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''.\n\nHe supported [[Joan Collins]] in the miniseries ''[[Monte Carlo (miniseries)|Monte Carlo]]'' (1986) and had the lead in a short lived series ''[[Spies (TV series)|Spies]]'' (1987).  He supported [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in ''[[Poker Alice (film)|Poker Alice]]'' (1987).\n\n===1990s===\nA break for Hamilton came in 1990 when [[Francis Ford Coppola]] cast him as the Corleone family's lawyer in a much-anticipated film, ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.\n\nFor the second time, he portrayed a murderer on the television series ''[[Columbo]]'', starring as the host of a TV true-crime show in the 1991 episode \"[[List of Columbo episodes|Caution: Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health]].\" He had previously been in the 1975 episode \"A Deadly State of Mind\".\n\nHamilton had small roles in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1991), ''[[Once Upon a Crime]]'' (1992) and ''[[Amore! (1993 film)|Amore!]]'' (1993) and guest starred on ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]]'' and ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]''. He went to Germany to make ''[[Das Paradies am Ende der Berge]]'' (1993) and did ''[[Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent]]'' (1994), ''[[Vanished (1995 film)|Vanished]]'' (1995), and ''[[Playback (1996 film)|Playback]]'' (1996), as well as guest starring on shows like ''[[Bonnie (TV series)|Bonnie]]'', ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]]'', ''[[Hart to Hart]]'' and ''The Guilt''.\n\nHe was in ''[[Meet Wally Sparks]]'' (1997), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), and ''[[Rough Riders (miniseries)|Rough Riders]]'' (1997). With his matinee-idol looks it was sometimes noted that Hamilton physically resembled [[Warren Beatty]]. Beatty's political satire ''[[Bulworth]]'' (1998) contained a running gag about this with Hamilton appearing as himself in a brief cameo. Hamilton had a regular role on the short lived TV series ''[[Jenny (TV series)|Jenny]]'' (1997).\n\nHe was in ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]'' (1998), ''[[P.T. Barnum (film)|P.T. Barnum]]'' (1999) and ''[[She's Too Tall]]'' (1999). He was a semi-regular celebrity guest on the 1998-99 syndicated version of ''[[Match Game]]''\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003, Hamilton hosted ''[[The Family (U.S. TV series)|The Family]]'' which was a reality television series on ABC for one season. The program starred ten members from a traditional Italian-American family, each fighting for a $1,000,000 prize. In 2006, Hamilton competed in the second season of ABC's ''Dancing with the Stars''<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancing/ Dancing With The Stars]&nbsp;\u2013 ABC.com</ref> with professional [[Edyta Sliwinska]] in which they lasted until the sixth round. At age 66 and recovering from knee injuries, Hamilton, unable to match the limber dance moves of his younger competitors, charmed the audience and judges with endearingly silly dances utilizing props including a [[Zorro]] mask and the sword from ''Zorro, The Gay Blade''.\n\nIn 2006, it was rumored that Hamilton would replace [[Bob Barker]] on ''[[The Price Is Right (American game show)|The Price Is Right]]''. He auditioned for the show and in March 2007, [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] reported that Hamilton was a frontrunner to replace Barker. According to [[Reuters]], Hamilton was one of the final three contenders to host the show, alongside [[Mark Steines]] and [[Todd Newton]].<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSN1624240720070416 Trio remaining in Price line] from Reuters</ref> Soon thereafter, however, [[Drew Carey]] was named as Barker's successor.

Previously, Indonesia also hosted in [[1979 Southeast Asian Games|1979]] and [[1987 Southeast Asian Games|1987]]. The capital city of [[Jakarta]] hosted all three of the previous Games prior to this. Palembang became the third SEA Games non-capital host city, after [[Chiang Mai]] ([[1995 Southeast Asian Games|1995]]) and [[Nakhon Ratchasima]] ([[2007 Southeast Asian Games|2007]]), both in [[Thailand]]. Around 5,965 athletes from 11 participating nations participated at the games which featured 545 events in 44 sports. The biggest competitor, sports, and events in Southeast Asian Games history.\n\nThe games was held  from 11 to 22 November 2011, although several events had commenced from 3 November 2011. The games was opened by [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]], the [[President of Indonesia]] at the [[Gelora Sriwijaya Stadium]] in Palembang.\n\nThe final medal tally was led by host [[Indonesia at the 2011 Southeast Asian Games|Indonesia]], followed by [[Thailand at the 2011 Southeast Asian Games|Thailand]] and [[Vietnam at the 2011 Southeast Asian Games|Vietnam]], while [[Timor-Leste at the 2011 Southeast Asian Games|Timor-Leste]] won its first ever Southeast Asian Games gold medal. Several Games and national records were broken during the games. Although there were several controversies, the Games were deemed generally successful with its promotion for conservative effort on endangered fauna species namely the [[komodo dragon]] through the mascot and with the rising standard of competition amongst the Southeast Asian nations.\n\nDespite not held in the capital city Jakarta, but the opening ceremony in this edition was dubbed by international media from around the world as the most magnificent, luxurious, and spectacular opening ceremony in Southeast Asian Games history with special showcase of lightning and gigantic fireworks. Washington Post USA and The Guardian UK November edition make this opening ceremony as their newspaper headlines. The 26th SEA Games opening ceremony in Palembang was the first SEA Games to utilise spider camera, large [[LED]] screen and [[large-format projection]] technology provided by Australian-based Electric Canvas. The mass dance performance featured \"The Glory of [[Srivijaya]]\" as the theme.\n==Organisation==\n\n===Host city===\n{{Location map many\n |Indonesia\n |label=Palembang |marksize=8\n    |pos=right\n    |lat_deg=2|lat_min=59|lat_dir=S\n    |lon_deg=104|lon_min=45|lon_dir=E\n|label2=Jakarta\n    |mark2size=8\n    |pos2=bottom  \n    |lat2_deg=6|lat2_min=12|lat2_dir=S\n    |lon2_deg=106|lon2_min=48|lon2_dir=E\n |width=300\n |float=left\n |caption=Co-hosts of 2011 Southeast Asian Games\n}}\n[[Palembang]], the capital city of [[South Sumatra]] was the main host of the games,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/only-two-cities-to-host-sea-games/386928 |title=Only Two Cities to Host SEA Games |date=21 July 2010 |accessdate=28 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724055758/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/only-two-cities-to-host-sea-games/386928 |archive-date=24 July 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://olahraga.kompas.com/read/xml/2009/11/14/23320364/Indonesia.Targetkan.Juara.Umum.SEA.Games.2011|title=Indonesia Targetkan Juara Umum SEA Games 2011|date=8 August 2010|accessdate=28 November 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091120015544/http://olahraga.kompas.com/read/xml/2009/11/14/23320364/indonesia.targetkan.juara.umum.sea.games.2011| archivedate= 20 November 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> while the nation's capital [[Jakarta]] was the co-host.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/sports/indonesian-president-makes-jakarta-a-co-host-for-2011-southeast-asian-games/389974|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120917194425/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/sports/indonesian-president-makes-jakarta-a-co-host-for-2011-southeast-asian-games/389974|url-status=dead|archive-date=17 September 2012|title=Indonesian President Makes Jakarta a Co-host For 2011 Southeast Asian Games|date=7 August 2010|accessdate=8 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=pt. kompas cyber media |url=http://nasional.kompas.com/read/2011/01/14/0424142/Jumlah.Nomor.Tidak.Akan.Berkurang.Banyak |title=Jumlah Nomor Tidak Akan Berkurang Banyak |publisher=Nasional.kompas.com |date=14 January 2011 |accessdate=2 June 2011}}</ref>\nAs the main host, [[Palembang]] only held 22 of 42 sports, the rest was held by the co-host city.

On his maternal side, Ingham's ancestors were mostly from Hebden Bridge and [[Heptonstall]], while his maternal grandmother Jane Vernon descended from Staffordshire coal miners.\n\n==Press secretary to Margaret Thatcher==\nIngham spent 11 years as [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s chief [[press secretary]] in [[No. 10 Downing Street]] when she as Prime Minister. In 1989\u201390 he was also head of the [[Government Information Office]]. In the course of his civil service career he was also press secretary to [[Barbara Castle]], [[Robert Carr]], [[Maurice Macmillan]], [[Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington|Lord Carrington]], [[Eric Varley]] and [[Tony Benn]].\n\nAlthough a career civil servant, Ingham gained a reputation for being a highly effective propagandist for the [[Thatcherite]] cause.  The phrase [[spin doctor]] did not enter common parlance until after his retirement, but he was nevertheless considered a gifted exponent in what came to be known as the \"black arts\" of [[Spin doctor|spin]].{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn those days, Downing Street briefings were \"[[Journalism sourcing#Using confidential information|off the record]]\", meaning that information given out by Ingham could be attributed only to \"senior government sources\". Occasionally he used this deniability to brief against the government's own ministers, such as when he described the [[leader of the House of Commons]] [[John Biffen]] as a \"semi-detached\" member of the government.<ref>{{cite book |last= Harris|first=Robert |title= 'Good and Faithful Servant' \u2013 The Unauthorised Biography of Bernard Ingham|year= 1990|publisher= Faber and Faber|location= London|isbn= 0-571-16547-8|page=146}}</ref> Biffen was dropped at the next reshuffle. This blurring of the distinction between his nominally neutral role as a civil servant and a more partisan role as apologist and promoter of [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s policies led the late [[Christopher Hitchens]] to characterise Ingham as \"a nugatory individual\" and to criticise what he saw as the negative consequences of Ingham's time as Thatcher's press secretary: \"During his time in office, Fleet Street took several steps towards an American system of Presidentially-managed coverage and sound-bite deference, without acquiring any of the American constitutional protection in return.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hitchens |first=Christopher |title=What is this Bernard? |journal=London Review of Books |date=10 January 1991 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=9 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1987 Downing Street berated the ''Sun'' newspaper in a storm over honours. Thatcher was said to be furious, and Ingham, the Prime Minister's Press Secretary, sent correspondence to the Sun, for an explanation as to the honours list, given in confidence, being published.\n<ref>From the archive, 31 December 1987: Downing Street berates Sun in honours storm | From the Guardian | The Guardian |\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/dec/31/archive-1987-sun-honours-storm</ref>\n\nIn 1989, three years after the [[Westland affair|Westland helicopter scandal]] led to the resignation of Defence Secretary [[Michael Heseltine]], former cabinet minister [[Leon Brittan]] revealed in a [[Channel 4]] programme that Ingham was one of two senior Downing Street officials who had approved the leaking of a crucial letter from the then [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor General]] [[Patrick Mayhew, Baron Mayhew of Twysden|Patrick Mayhew]], in which he questioned some of the statements that Heseltine had made about the takeover contest of the Westland helicopter company. Brittan's claim that Ingham and [[Charles Powell, Baron Powell of Bayswater|Charles Powell]] had approved the leak of the letter led to calls from some Labour MPs for there to be a new inquiry into the Westland affair.<ref>{{cite news |last=Trotter |first=Stuart |title=Westland affair re-opened by Brittan |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&dat=19890406&id=VTFAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QFkMAAAAIBAJ&pg=6355,1388601 |accessdate=8 February 2014 |newspaper=The Glasgow Herald |date=6 April 1989}}</ref>\n\nIngham was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] on Thatcher's resignation \u2013 and retirement \u2013 in 1990.

I picked it up eagerly, refusing to believe that someone so close to the top for so long could fail to reveal, even by mistake, a single interesting piece of information\" and he was particularly scathing about Ingham's prose style, offering the following quotation from ''Kill the Messenger'' as representative of Ingham's use of English: \"Like a mighty oak, it took more than one axe to bring Mrs Thatcher down. In November 1990 they were cutting into this solid timber from all angles. The frenzy was fearsome to behold. Heaven preserve us from political axe-men in a state of panic.

On his maternal side, Ingham's ancestors were mostly from Hebden Bridge and [[Heptonstall]], while his maternal grandmother Jane Vernon descended from Staffordshire coal miners.\n\n==Press secretary to Margaret Thatcher==\nIngham spent 11 years as [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s chief [[press secretary]] in [[No. 10 Downing Street]] when she as Prime Minister. In 1989\u201390 he was also head of the [[Government Information Office]]. In the course of his civil service career he was also press secretary to [[Barbara Castle]], [[Robert Carr]], [[Maurice Macmillan]], [[Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington|Lord Carrington]], [[Eric Varley]] and [[Tony Benn]].\n\nAlthough a career civil servant, Ingham gained a reputation for being a highly effective propagandist for the [[Thatcherite]] cause.  The phrase [[spin doctor]] did not enter common parlance until after his retirement, but he was nevertheless considered a gifted exponent in what came to be known as the \"black arts\" of [[Spin doctor|spin]].{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn those days, Downing Street briefings were \"[[Journalism sourcing#Using confidential information|off the record]]\", meaning that information given out by Ingham could be attributed only to \"senior government sources\". Occasionally he used this deniability to brief against the government's own ministers, such as when he described the [[leader of the House of Commons]] [[John Biffen]] as a \"semi-detached\" member of the government.<ref>{{cite book |last= Harris|first=Robert |title= 'Good and Faithful Servant' \u2013 The Unauthorised Biography of Bernard Ingham|year= 1990|publisher= Faber and Faber|location= London|isbn= 0-571-16547-8|page=146}}</ref> Biffen was dropped at the next reshuffle. This blurring of the distinction between his nominally neutral role as a civil servant and a more partisan role as apologist and promoter of [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s policies led the late [[Christopher Hitchens]] to characterise Ingham as \"a nugatory individual\" and to criticise what he saw as the negative consequences of Ingham's time as Thatcher's press secretary: \"During his time in office, Fleet Street took several steps towards an American system of Presidentially-managed coverage and sound-bite deference, without acquiring any of the American constitutional protection in return.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hitchens |first=Christopher |title=What is this Bernard? |journal=London Review of Books |date=10 January 1991 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=9 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1987 Downing Street berated the ''Sun'' newspaper in a storm over honours. Thatcher was said to be furious, and Ingham, the Prime Minister's Press Secretary, sent correspondence to the Sun, for an explanation as to the honours list, given in confidence, being published.\n<ref>From the archive, 31 December 1987: Downing Street berates Sun in honours storm | From the Guardian | The Guardian |\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/dec/31/archive-1987-sun-honours-storm</ref>\n\nIn 1989, three years after the [[Westland affair|Westland helicopter scandal]] led to the resignation of Defence Secretary [[Michael Heseltine]], former cabinet minister [[Leon Brittan]] revealed in a [[Channel 4]] programme that Ingham was one of two senior Downing Street officials who had approved the leaking of a crucial letter from the then [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor General]] [[Patrick Mayhew, Baron Mayhew of Twysden|Patrick Mayhew]], in which he questioned some of the statements that Heseltine had made about the takeover contest of the Westland helicopter company. Brittan's claim that Ingham and [[Charles Powell, Baron Powell of Bayswater|Charles Powell]] had approved the leak of the letter led to calls from some Labour MPs for there to be a new inquiry into the Westland affair.<ref>{{cite news |last=Trotter |first=Stuart |title=Westland affair re-opened by Brittan |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&dat=19890406&id=VTFAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QFkMAAAAIBAJ&pg=6355,1388601 |accessdate=8 February 2014 |newspaper=The Glasgow Herald |date=6 April 1989}}</ref>\n\nIngham was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] on Thatcher's resignation \u2013 and retirement \u2013 in 1990.

[[Paul Foot (campaigner)|Paul Foot]], a [[Marxism|Marxist]] journalist, commented that \"...&nbsp;there is no information in this book. I picked it up eagerly, refusing to believe that someone so close to the top for so long could fail to reveal, even by mistake, a single interesting piece of information\" and he was particularly scathing about Ingham's prose style, offering the following quotation from ''Kill the Messenger'' as representative of Ingham's use of English: \"Like a mighty oak, it took more than one axe to bring Mrs Thatcher down. In November 1990 they were cutting into this solid timber from all angles. The frenzy was fearsome to behold. Heaven preserve us from political axe-men in a state of panic.

[[Aidy Boothroyd]] was later appointed Lambert's successor and the club spent most of the season in the [[English Football League play-offs|play-off]] positions. A late season collapse in form meant the U's dropped out of the play-offs with seven games remaining, but were not able to return, eventually finishing in eighth, eight points shy of the play-offs. Eighth place was still the fourth best-ever league result in the club's history.\n\nIn the cups, Colchester were eliminated in the first rounds of the League Cup and Football League Trophy, but progressed to the third round of the FA Cup. After beating [[Bromley F.C.|Bromley]] and then [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]], Colchester faced [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] but were beaten 7\u20130 at [[Deepdale]] following five second half goals.\n\n==Season overview==\n[[Paul Lambert]] vowed he would have a mass clear out of players over the summer as each player was called in to meet him to discuss their future before May was over. He had identified his transfer targets with chairman [[Robbie Cowling]] willing to fund those ambitions. Incoming were [[Ashley Vincent]], following a loan spell last season, as well as [[Lee Beevers]], [[David Fox (footballer)|David Fox]], [[Magnus Okuonghae]] and [[Ben Williams (footballer, born 1982)|Ben Williams]], all on permanent deals. Outgoing was [[Mark Yeates]], last season's top scorer, who joined [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] for \u00a3450,000.\n\nLambert's contracted outcasts were consigned to training with the youth team and denied squad numbers and a place in the squad photo. [[Chris Coyne]] left the club to return to his native Australia, while [[Jamie Guy]], [[Matt Heath]], [[Philip Ifil]], [[Johnnie Jackson]], [[Matt Lockwood]] and [[John White (footballer, born 1986)|John White]] were all among those affected by Lambert's managerial tactics. He then brought in [[Hamilton Academical F.C.|Hamilton Academical]] [[Forward (association football)|forward]] [[Jo\u00ebl Thomas]] in a long protracted transfer deal for \u00a3125,000.\n\nThree days prior to the season opener against [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], the club announced the signing of former striker [[Kevin Lisbie]] on loan from [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]. He scored twice on his second debut for the club as Colchester thrashed Norwich 7\u20131 at [[Carrow Road]]. A week later, Colchester remained at the top of [[EFL League One|League One]] following a 2\u20131 win over [[Yeovil Town F.C.|Yeovil Town]]. Norwich City contacted Robbie Cowling following the game asking to approach Lambert regarding their vacant manager position after they had sacked [[Bryan Gunn]] following the U's famous victory. Cowling initially refused, but later relented with Lambert declaring his interest in joining City. Cowling offered Lambert the chance to talk to Norwich on the proviso no offer could be accepted until compensation was discussed and agreed between the two clubs. Compensation was never agreed and Lambert resigned with Colchester due to host [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] the same day. Lambert's assistants [[Ian Culverhouse]] and Gary Karsa also resigned the day after his appointment at Norwich.\n\nCowling vowed to take Norwich to a [[English Football League|Football League]] tribunal. In the meantime, former [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] manager [[Aidy Boothroyd]] was unveiled on 3 September as Lambert's replacement. He enjoyed a nine game unbeaten run following his appointment, while making the loan signings of [[Danny Batth]], [[Kayode Odejayi]] and [[John-Joe O'Toole]]. The latter two were then signed on a permanent basis in the January transfer window.\n\nWith the Lambert compensation issue still continuing into January, and with the U's set to host Lambert's Norwich in the league, Cowling refused to allocate additional tickets to the travelling Norwich fans for the fixture. Cowling claimed he would prefer the stadium have an empty seat than one occupied by another Norwich City fan. The game itself attracted a record attendance of 10,064, but Norwich gained revenge over the U's, winning 5\u20130 on the day.\n\nAt the end of February, Colchester's form took a negative turn, suffering an eight game winless run and dropped from third place to seventh and outside of the [[English Football League play-offs|play-off]] places for only the second time this season. With seven games remaining, Colchester were unable to make a return to the play-off spots and would eventually finish eighth, eight points away from the play-offs, yet a result that was their fourth best-ever league result.\n\nColchester were eliminated from the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] in the first round by [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]], while Gillingham beat the U's following a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]] in the [[EFL Trophy|Football League Trophy]]. In the [[FA Cup]], the U's beat [[Bromley F.C.|Bromley]] and [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]] on their way to the third round, but were heavily beaten 7\u20130 at [[Deepdale]] by [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] in the game prior to their 5\u20130 home defeat by Norwich.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cu-fc.com/news/2013/august/the-1990s-and-2000s/ |title=The 1990s and 2000s |last=Hudson |first=Matt |date=11 August 2013 |publisher=Colchester United FC |accessdate=11 December 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==Players==\n{{updated|match played 8 May 2010.}}<ref name=\"apps\">{{cite web |url=https://www.coludata.co.uk/content.php?pg=appearances&pd=1010#frmft=True&pg=appearances&pd=1010&fsea=70&fplist=all&flgcup=all&fcompstShowAll=&fdfaShowAll= |title=Appearances |publisher=Coludata.co.uk |accessdate=12 December 2018 }}</ref><ref name=\"FS\">{{cite web |url=http://www.footballsquads.co.uk/eng/2009-2010/flone/colches.htm |title=Colchester United |publisher=FootballSquads |accessdate=12 December 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.11v11.com/teams/colchester-united/tab/players/season/2010/ |title=All Colchester United football club players: 2010 |publisher=11v11.com |accessdate=12 December 2018 }}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%; width:100%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#2191CC; color:white; border:1px solid #F7C408; text-align:center;\"| No.\n! style=\"background:#2191CC; color:white; border:1px solid #F7C408; text-align:center;\"| Name\n! style=\"background:#2191CC; color:white; border:1px solid #F7C408; text-align:center;\"| Position\n! style=\"background:#2191CC; color:white; border:1px solid #F7C408; text-align:center;\"| Nationality\n! style=\"background:#2191CC; color:white; border:1px solid #F7C408; text-align:center;\"| Place of birth\n! style=\"background:#2191CC; color:white; border:1px solid #F7C408; text-align:center;\"| Date of birth\n! style=\"background:#2191CC; color:white; border:1px solid #F7C408; text-align:center;\"| Apps\n! style=\"background:#2191CC; color:white; border:1px solid #F7C408; text-align:center;\"| Goals\n! style=\"background:#2191CC; color:white; border:1px solid #F7C408; text-align:center;\"| Signed from\n! style=\"background:#2191CC; color:white; border:1px solid #F7C408; text-align:center;\"| Date signed\n! style=\"background:#2191CC; color:white; border:1px solid #F7C408; text-align:center;\"| Fee\n|-\n! colspan=\"13\" style=\"background:#dcdcdc; text-align:center;\"| Goalkeepers\n|-\n|1||[[Ben Williams (footballer, born 1982)|Ben Williams]]||[[Goalkeeper (association football)|GK]]||{{flagicon|ENG}}||[[Manchester]]||{{birth date and age2 |2009|6|1|1982|8|27|df=y}}||0||0||{{flagicon|ENG}} [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]]||10 July 2009||Undisclosed\n|-\n|12||[[Mark Cousins (footballer)|Mark Cousins]]||[[Goalkeeper (association football)|GK]]||{{flagicon|ENG}}||[[Chelmsford]]||{{birth date and age2 |2009|6|1|1987|1|9|df=y}}||15||0||[[Colchester United F.C.

Alongside competing in the League One, the club also participated in the [[FA Cup]], the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] and the [[EFL Trophy|Football League Trophy]].\n\nFollowing a famous 7\u20131 opening day win at [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], [[Manager (association football)|manager]] [[Paul Lambert]] left Colchester for the Canaries under a storm surrounding compensation. [[Aidy Boothroyd]] was later appointed Lambert's successor and the club spent most of the season in the [[English Football League play-offs|play-off]] positions. A late season collapse in form meant the U's dropped out of the play-offs with seven games remaining, but were not able to return, eventually finishing in eighth, eight points shy of the play-offs. Eighth place was still the fourth best-ever league result in the club's history.\n\nIn the cups, Colchester were eliminated in the first rounds of the League Cup and Football League Trophy, but progressed to the third round of the FA Cup. After beating [[Bromley F.C.|Bromley]] and then [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]], Colchester faced [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] but were beaten 7\u20130 at [[Deepdale]] following five second half goals.\n\n==Season overview==\n[[Paul Lambert]] vowed he would have a mass clear out of players over the summer as each player was called in to meet him to discuss their future before May was over. He had identified his transfer targets with chairman [[Robbie Cowling]] willing to fund those ambitions. Incoming were [[Ashley Vincent]], following a loan spell last season, as well as [[Lee Beevers]], [[David Fox (footballer)|David Fox]], [[Magnus Okuonghae]] and [[Ben Williams (footballer, born 1982)|Ben Williams]], all on permanent deals. Outgoing was [[Mark Yeates]], last seasons top scorer, who joined [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] for \u00a3450,000.\n\nLambert's contracted outcasts were consigned to training with the youth team and denied squad numbers and a place in the squad photo. [[Chris Coyne]] left the club to return to his native Australia, while [[Jamie Guy]], [[Matt Heath]], [[Philip Ifil]], [[Johnnie Jackson]], [[Matt Lockwood]] and [[John White (footballer, born 1986)|John White]] were all among those affected by Lambert's managerial tactics. He then brought in [[Hamilton Academical F.C.|Hamilton Academical]] [[Forward (association football)|forward]] [[Jo\u00ebl Thomas]] in a long protracted transfer deal for \u00a3125,000.\n\nThree days prior to the season opener against [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], the club announced the signing of former striker [[Kevin Lisbie]] on loan from [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]. He scored twice on his second debut for the club as Colchester thrashed Norwich 7\u20131 at [[Carrow Road]]. A week later, Colchester remained at the top of [[EFL League One|League One]] following a 2\u20131 win over [[Yeovil Town F.C.|Yeovil Town]]. Norwich City contacted Robbie Cowling following the game asking to approach Lambert regarding their vacant manager position after they had sacked [[Bryan Gunn]] following the U's famous victory. Cowling initially refused, but later relented with Lambert declaring his interest in joining City. Cowling offered Lambert the chance to talk to Norwich on the proviso no offer could be accepted until compensation was discussed and agreed between the two clubs. Compensation was never agreed and Lambert resigned with Colchester due to host [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] the same day. Lambert's assistants [[Ian Culverhouse]] and Gary Karsa also resigned the day after his appointment at Norwich.\n\nCowling vowed to take Norwich to a [[English Football League|Football League]] tribunal. In the meantime, former [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] manager [[Aidy Boothroyd]] was unveiled on 3 September as Lambert's replacement. He enjoyed a nine game unbeaten run following his appointment, while making the loan signings of [[Danny Batth]], [[Kayode Odejayi]] and [[John-Joe O'Toole]]. The latter two were then signed on a permanent basis in the January transfer window.\n\nWith the Lambert compensation issue still continuing into January, and with the U's set to host Lambert's Norwich in the league, Cowling refused to allocate additional tickets to the travelling Norwich fans for the fixture. Cowling claimed he would prefer the stadium have an empty seat than one occupied by another Norwich City fan. The game itself attracted a record attendance of 10,064, but Norwich gained revenge over the U's, winning 5\u20130 on the day.\n\nAt the end of February, Colchester's form took a negative turn, suffering an eight game winless run and dropped from third place to seventh and outside of the [[English Football League play-offs|play-off]] places for only the second time this season. With seven games remaining, Colchester were unable to make a return to the play-off spots and would eventually finish eighth, eight points away from the play-offs, yet a result that was their fourth best-ever league result.\n\nColchester were eliminated from the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] in the first round by [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]], while Gillingham beat the U's following a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]] in the [[EFL Trophy|Football League Trophy]]. In the [[FA Cup]], the U's beat [[Bromley F.C.|Bromley]] and [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]] on their way to the third round, but were heavily beaten 7\u20130 at [[Deepdale]] by [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] in the game prior to their 5\u20130 home defeat by Norwich.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cu-fc.com/news/2013/august/the-1990s-and-2000s/ |title=The 1990s and 2000s |last=Hudson |first=Matt |date=11 August 2013 |publisher=Colchester United FC |accessdate=11 December 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==Players==\n{{updated|match played 8 May 2010.}}<ref name=\"apps\">{{cite web |url=https://www.coludata.co.uk/content.php?pg=appearances&pd=1010#frmft=True&pg=appearances&pd=1010&fsea=70&fplist=all&flgcup=all&fcompstShowAll=&fdfaShowAll= |title=Appearances |publisher=Coludata.co.uk |accessdate=12 December 2018 }}</ref><ref name=\"FS\">{{cite web |url=http://www.footballsquads.co.uk/eng/2009-2010/flone/colches.htm |title=Colchester United |publisher=FootballSquads |accessdate=12 December 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.11v11.com/teams/colchester-united/tab/players/season/2010/ |title=All Colchester United football club players: 2010 |publisher=11v11.com |accessdate=12 December 2018 }}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%; width:100%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#2191CC; color:white; border:1px solid #F7C408; text-align:center;\"| No.\n! style=\"background:#2191CC; color:white; border:1px solid #F7C408; text-align:center;\"| Name\n! style=\"background:#2191CC; color:white; border:1px solid #F7C408; text-align:center;\"| Position\n! style=\"background:#2191CC; color:white; border:1px solid #F7C408; text-align:center;\"| Nationality\n! style=\"background:#2191CC; color:white; border:1px solid #F7C408; text-align:center;\"| Place of birth\n! style=\"background:#2191CC; color:white; border:1px solid #F7C408; text-align:center;\"| Date of birth\n! style=\"background:#2191CC; color:white; border:1px solid #F7C408; text-align:center;\"| Apps\n! style=\"background:#2191CC; color:white; border:1px solid #F7C408; text-align:center;\"| Goals\n! style=\"background:#2191CC; color:white; border:1px solid #F7C408; text-align:center;\"| Signed from\n! style=\"background:#2191CC; color:white; border:1px solid #F7C408; text-align:center;\"| Date signed\n! style=\"background:#2191CC; color:white; border:1px solid #F7C408; text-align:center;\"| Fee\n|-\n! colspan=\"13\" style=\"background:#dcdcdc; text-align:center;\"| Goalkeepers\n|-\n|1||[[Ben Williams (footballer, born 1982)|Ben Williams]]||[[Goalkeeper (association football)|GK]]||{{flagicon|ENG}}||[[Manchester]]||{{birth date and age2 |2009|6|1|1982|8|27|df=y}}||0||0||{{flagicon|ENG}} [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]]||10 July 2009||Undisclosed\n|-\n|12||[[Mark Cousins (footballer)|Mark Cousins]]||[[Goalkeeper (association football)|GK]]||{{flagicon|ENG}}||[[Chelmsford]]||{{birth date and age2 |2009|6|1|1987|1|9|df=y}}||15||0||[[Colchester United F.C.

It was the 21st&nbsp;[[FIFA World Cup]], a worldwide football tournament held once every four years. It was the 11th&nbsp;time the championships had been held in Europe, and the first time they were held in Eastern Europe. At an estimated cost of over $14.2&nbsp;billion, it was the most expensive World Cup to date.\n\nThe finals involved 32 teams, of which 31 came through [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualifying competitions]], while as the host nation [[Russia national football team|Russia]] qualified automatically. Of the 32, 20 had also appeared in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 event]], while both [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] and [[Panama national football team|Panama]] made their first appearances at the World Cup. 64 matches were played in 12 venues across 11 cities. [[Germany national football team|Germany]], the defending champions, were eliminated in the group stage. Host nation Russia was eliminated in the quarter-finals. In the [[2018 FIFA World Cup Final|final]], [[France national football team|France]] played [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] on 15&nbsp;July at the [[Luzhniki Stadium]] in [[Moscow]]. France won the match 4\u20132 to claim their second World Cup.\n\nThe event featured a number of accolades. Croatian player [[Luka Modri\u0107]] was voted the tournament's best player winning the Golden Ball. England's [[Harry Kane]] scored the most goals during the tournament with six. [[Thibaut Courtois]] won the Golden Glove awarded to the [[goalkeeper]] with the most [[clean sheet]]s. The event was praised for the quality of football but criticised for being a distraction from [[Doping in Russia|doping allegations]] and public relations within Russia. It has been estimated that more than three million people attended games during the tournament.\n\n==Host selection==\n{{Main|Russia 2018 FIFA World Cup bid}}\n[[File:Russia 2018 World Cup.jpeg|thumb|Russian bid personnel celebrate the awarding of the 2018 World Cup to Russia on 2 December 2010.]]\n[[File:Vladimir Putin FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour kick-off ceremony.jpg|thumb|President [[Vladimir Putin]] holding the [[FIFA World Cup Trophy]] at a pre-tournament ceremony in Moscow on 9&nbsp;September 2017]]\n[[File:Russia 100 Rubles 2018 FIFA World Cup.jpg|thumb|upright|The 100-[[Russian ruble|ruble]] commemorative banknote celebrates the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

As such, there were eventually four bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, two of which were joint bids: England, Russia, Netherlands/Belgium, and Portugal/Spain.<ref name=\"xBccj\" />\n\nThe 22-member [[FIFA Council|FIFA Executive Committee]] convened in [[Z\u00fcrich]] on 2&nbsp;December 2010 to vote to select the hosts of both tournaments.<ref name=\"WFQKr\" /> Russia won the right to be the 2018 host in the second round of voting.

Garcia]], a US attorney, to investigate and produce [[Garcia Report|a report]] on the corruption allegations. Although the report was never published, FIFA released a 42-page summary of its findings as determined by German judge [[Hans-Joachim Eckert]].

Russia has come across as friendly and hospitable: a stark contrast with the country's authoritarian image. All the foreign fans I have spoken to are pleasantly surprised.\"<ref name=\"91I71\" />\n\nFIFA president [[Gianni Infantino]] stated: \"Everyone discovered a beautiful country, a welcoming country, that is keen to show the world that everything that has been said before might not be true. A lot of preconceived ideas have been changed because people have seen the true nature of Russia.\"<ref name=\"kVyG9\" /> Infantino has proclaimed Russia 2018 to be \"the best World Cup ever\", as 98% of the stadiums were sold out, there were three billion viewers on TV around the world and seven million fans visited the fan fests.<ref name=\"kl1QG\" />\n\nHowever, the tournament was called a distraction from the international isolation and economic difficulties Russia has been facing.<ref name=\"FhofV\" /><ref name=\"ve3Sg\" /><ref name=\"M6MSu\" />\n\n==Broadcasting rights==\n{{Main|2018 FIFA World Cup broadcasting rights}}\nFIFA, through several companies, sold the broadcasting rights for the 2018 FIFA World Cup to various local broadcasters. After having tested the technology at limited matches of the [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup]],<ref name=\"wPguj\" /> and the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] (via private tests and public viewings in the host city of [[Rio de Janeiro]]),<ref name=\"kVsNi\" /> the 2018 World Cup was the first World Cup in which all matches were produced in [[4K resolution|4K]] [[Ultra-high-definition television|ultra high definition]]. Host Broadcast Services (HBS) stated that at least 75% of the broadcast cut of each match would come from 4K cameras (covering the majority of main angles), with instant replays and some camera angles being converted up from [[1080p]] high definition sources with limited degradation in quality. These broadcasts were made available from selected rightsholders and television providers.<ref name=\"TCu23\" /><ref name=\"0j6eE\" /><ref name=\"6j06c\" />\n\nIn February 2018, Ukrainian rightsholder [[UA:PBC]] stated that it would not broadcast the World Cup. This came in the wake of growing boycotts of the tournament among the [[Football Federation of Ukraine]] and sports minister [[Ihor Zhdanov]].<ref name=\"Xv82A\" /><ref name=\"0gvp3\" /> Additionally, the Football Federation of Ukraine refused to accredit journalists for the World Cup and waived their quota of tickets.<ref name=\"MLa57\" /> However, the Ukrainian state TV still broadcast the World Cup, and more than four million Ukrainians watched the opening match.<ref name=\"YqvyD\" />\n\nBroadcast rights to the tournament in the Middle East were hampered by an ongoing [[2017\u201318 Qatar diplomatic crisis|diplomatic crisis in Qatar]], which saw Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates cut diplomatic ties with Qatar\u2014the home country of FIFA's Middle East and Africa rightsholder [[beIN Sports]]\u2014in June 2017, over its [[Qatar and state-sponsored terrorism|alleged state support of terrorist groups]]. On 2&nbsp;June 2018, beIN pulled its channels from [[Du (company)|Du]] and [[Etisalat]], but with service to the latter restored later that day. Etisalat subsequently announced that it would air the World Cup in the UAE, and continue to offer beIN normally and without interruptions.<ref name=\"y5Kr4\" /><ref name=\"mvmPW\" /><ref name=\"jyl42\" /> In Saudi Arabia, beIN was banned from doing business; as a result, its channels and other content have been widely and illegally repackaged by a broadcaster identifying itself as \"[[beoutQ]]\". While FIFA attempted to negotiate the sale of a package consisting of Saudi matches and the final indirectly, they were unable to do so. On 12&nbsp;July 2018, FIFA stated that it had \"engaged counsel to take legal action in Saudi Arabia and is working alongside other sports rights owners that have also been affected to protect its interests.\"<ref name=\"NIzbW\" /><ref name=\"6N9LV\" />\n\nIn the United States, the 2018 World Cup was the first men's World Cup whose English rights were held by [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]], and Spanish rights held by [[Telemundo Deportes|Telemundo]]. The elimination of the United States in qualifying led to concerns that US interest and viewership of this World Cup would be reduced, noting that \"casual\" viewers of U.S. matches caused them to peak at 16.5&nbsp;million viewers in 2014, and how much Fox paid for the rights. During a launch event prior to the elimination, Fox stated that it had planned to place a secondary focus on the Mexican team in its coverage to take advantage of their popularity among [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]]. Fox stated that it was still committed to broadcasting a significant amount of tournament coverage.<ref name=\"lJrJH\" /><ref name=\"Oo1hn\" /><ref name=\"1M4WS\" /> Viewership was down overall over 2014; match scheduling was not as favourable to viewers in the Americas as it was in 2014. Many matches aired in the morning hours, although Telemundo's broadcast of the Mexico-Sweden Group F match was announced as being its most-watched weekday [[Daytime television|daytime]] program in network history.<ref name=\"wx1ZL\" /><ref name=\"UFMpG\" />\n\nUnlike previous tournaments, where the rights were bundled with those of South Korea, [[Korean Central Television]] acquired rights to the 2018 World Cup within North Korea. Broadcasts only began with the round of 16, and matches were tape delayed and edited for time. In addition, matches involving Japan were excluded from the broadcasts, due to [[Japan\u2013North Korea relations|strained relations and campaigns against the country]].<ref name=\"iscoP\"

[[List of men's national association football teams|men's national teams]] and took place between 14&nbsp;June and 15&nbsp;July 2018 in Russia. It was the 21st&nbsp;[[FIFA World Cup]], a worldwide football tournament held once every four years. It was the 11th&nbsp;time the championships had been held in Europe, and the first time they were held in Eastern Europe. At an estimated cost of over $14.2&nbsp;billion, it was the most expensive World Cup to date.\n\nThe finals involved 32 teams, of which 31 came through [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualifying competitions]], while as the host nation [[Russia national football team|Russia]] qualified automatically. Of the 32, 20 had also appeared in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 event]], while both [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] and [[Panama national football team|Panama]] made their first appearances at the World Cup. 64 matches were played in 12 venues across 11 cities. [[Germany national football team|Germany]], the defending champions, were eliminated in the group stage. Host nation Russia was eliminated in the quarter-finals. In the [[2018 FIFA World Cup Final|final]], [[France national football team|France]] played [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] on 15&nbsp;July at the [[Luzhniki Stadium]] in [[Moscow]]. France won the match 4\u20132 to claim their second World Cup.\n\nThe event featured a number of accolades. Croatian player [[Luka Modri\u0107]] was voted the tournament's best player winning the Golden Ball. England's [[Harry Kane]] scored the most goals during the tournament with six. [[Thibaut Courtois]] won the Golden Glove awarded to the [[goalkeeper]] with the most [[clean sheet]]s. The event was praised for the quality of football but criticised for being a distraction from [[Doping in Russia|doping allegations]] and public relations within Russia. It has been estimated that more than three million people attended games during the tournament.\n\n==Host selection==\n{{Main|Russia 2018 FIFA World Cup bid}}\n[[File:Russia 2018 World Cup.jpeg|thumb|Russian bid personnel celebrate the awarding of the 2018 World Cup to Russia on 2 December 2010.]]\n[[File:Vladimir Putin FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour kick-off ceremony.jpg|thumb|President [[Vladimir Putin]] holding the [[FIFA World Cup Trophy]] at a pre-tournament ceremony in Moscow on 9&nbsp;September 2017]]\n[[File:Russia 100 Rubles 2018 FIFA World Cup.jpg|thumb|upright|The 100-[[Russian ruble|ruble]] commemorative banknote celebrates the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

As such, there were eventually four bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, two of which were joint bids: England, Russia, Netherlands/Belgium, and Portugal/Spain.<ref name=\"xBccj\" />\n\nThe 22-member [[FIFA Council|FIFA Executive Committee]] convened in [[Z\u00fcrich]] on 2&nbsp;December 2010 to vote to select the hosts of both tournaments.<ref name=\"WFQKr\" /> Russia won the right to be the 2018 host in the second round of voting. The Portugal/Spain bid came second, and that from Belgium/Netherlands third. England, which was bidding to host its second tournament, was eliminated in the first round.<ref name=\"kKxiB\" />\n\nThe voting results were:<ref name=\"xBccj\" />\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+2018 FIFA bidding (majority 12 votes)\n!rowspan=2|Bidders\n!colspan=2|Votes\n|-\n!Round 1\n!Round 2\n|-\n|'''Russia'''\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|9\n|{{yes|13}}\n|-\n|Portugal / Spain\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|7\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|7\n|-\n|Belgium / Netherlands\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|4\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|2\n|-\n|England\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|2\n|{{no result|Eliminated}}\n|}\n\n===Host selection criticism===\nThe choice of Russia as host has been challenged. Controversial issues included the level of racism in Russian football,<ref name=\"emKvG\" /><ref name=\"LlUcj\" /><ref name=\"hjJfX\" /> human rights abuses by the Russian government,<ref name=\"hkImm\" /> and discrimination against [[LGBT]] people in wider Russian society.<ref name=\"qKYJ4\" /><ref name=\"rMyFt\" /> Russia's involvement in the [[War in Donbass|ongoing conflict in Ukraine]] had also prompted calls for the tournament to be moved, particularly following the [[annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation of Crimea]].<ref name=\"eGuva\" /><ref name=\"tQHRS\" /> In 2014, FIFA president Sepp Blatter stated that \"the World Cup has been given and voted to Russia and we are going forward with our work\".<ref name=\"UeAW8\" />\n\nAllegations of [[corruption]] in the bidding processes and concerns over bribery on the part of the Russian team and corruption by FIFA members for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups led to threats from England's [[The Football Association|FA]] to boycott the tournament.<ref name=\"mZGjr\" /> They claimed that four members of the executive committee had requested bribes to vote for England, and [[Sepp Blatter]] had said it had already been arranged before the vote that Russia would win.<ref name=\"sRBCC\" /> FIFA appointed [[Michael J. Garcia]], a US attorney, to investigate and produce [[Garcia Report|a report]] on the corruption allegations. Although the report was never published, FIFA released a 42-page summary of its findings as determined by German judge [[Hans-Joachim Eckert]]. Eckert's summary cleared Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing, but was denounced by critics as a whitewash.<ref name=\"APfire\" /> Because of the controversy, the FA refused to accept Eckert's absolving Russia from blame. [[Greg Dyke]] called for a re-examination of the affair and [[David Bernstein (executive)|David Bernstein]] called for a boycott of the World Cup.<ref name=\"zt9ZM\" /><ref name=\"2xMiJ\" /> Garcia criticised the summary as being \"materially incomplete\" with \"erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions\", and appealed to FIFA's Appeal Committee.<ref name=\"K7Ghy\" /><ref name=\"WhatNow\" /> The committee declined to hear his appeal, so Garcia resigned to protest of FIFA's conduct, citing a \"lack of leadership\" and lack of confidence in Eckert's independence of Eckert.<ref name=\"0U57X\" />\n\nOn 3 June 2015, the [[FBI]] confirmed that federal authorities were investigating the bidding and awarding processes for the 2018 and [[2022 FIFA World Cup|2022 World Cups]].<ref name=\"r8Bz2\" /><ref name=\"lgRB1\" /> In an interview published on 7&nbsp;June 2015, [[Domenico Scala (manager)|Domenico Scala]], the head of FIFA's Audit And Compliance Committee, stated that \"should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled\".<ref name=\"BBC News\" /><ref name=\"Owen Gibson\" /> [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]] and former British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] attended a meeting with FIFA vice-president [[Chung Mong-joon]] in which a vote-trading deal for the right to host the 2018 World Cup in [[England 2018 FIFA World Cup bid|England]] was discussed.<ref name=\"SNVa0\" /><ref name=\"oJlN3\" />\n\n==Teams==\n\n===Qualification===\n{{Main|2018 FIFA World Cup qualification}}\nFor the first time in the history of the FIFA World Cup, all eligible nations\u2014the 209 [[List of FIFA Member Associations|FIFA member associations]] except automatically qualified hosts Russia\u2014applied to enter the qualifying process.<ref name=\"riaYh\" /> [[Zimbabwe national football team|Zimbabwe]] and [[Indonesia national football team|Indonesia]] were later disqualified before playing their first matches,<ref name=\"zimbabwe\" /><ref name=\"indonesia\" /> while [[Gibraltar national football team|Gibraltar]] and [[Kosovo national football team|Kosovo]], who joined FIFA on 13&nbsp;May 2016 after the qualifying draw but before European qualifying had begun, also entered the competition.<ref name=\"k8fRX\" /> Places in the tournament were allocated to continental confederations, with the allocation unchanged from the 2014 World Cup.<ref name=\"fifa20150320\" /><ref name=\"hstri\" /> The first qualification game, between [[Timor-Leste national football team|Timor-Leste]] and [[Mongolia national football team|Mongolia]], began in [[Dili]] on 12&nbsp;March 2015 as part of the [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)|AFC's qualification]],<ref name=\"45Ip9\" /><ref name=\"L1urj\" /><ref name=\"crlmz\" /> and the main qualifying draw took place at the [[Konstantinovsky Palace]] in [[Strelna]], [[Saint Petersburg]], on 25&nbsp;July 2015.<ref name=\"lzli9\" /><ref name=\"press release\" />\n\nOf the 32&nbsp;nations qualified to play at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, 20&nbsp;countries competed at the previous tournament in [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014]]. Both Iceland and Panama qualified for the first time, with the former becoming the [[List of countries and dependencies by population|smallest country in terms of population]] to reach the World Cup.<ref name=\"oGTMb\" /> Other teams returning after absences of at least three tournaments included: Egypt, returning to the finals after their last appearance in 1990; Morocco, who last competed in 1998; Peru, who last appeared in 1982; and Senegal, competing for the second time after reaching the quarter-finals in 2002. It was the first time three [[Nordic countries]] (Denmark, Iceland and Sweden) and four [[Arab world|Arab nations]] (Egypt, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia) qualified for the World Cup.<ref name=\"vviY2\" />\n\nNotable teams that failed to qualify included: four-time champions [[Italy national football team|Italy]] (for the first time since 1958), who were knocked out in a qualification play-off by quarter-finalists Sweden, and three-time runners-up and third placed in 2014 the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] (for the first time since 2002). Four reigning continental champions: [[2017 Africa Cup of Nations]] winners [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]]; two-time [[Copa Am\u00e9rica]] champions and [[2017 FIFA Confederations Cup|2017 Confederations Cup]] runners-up [[Chile national football team|Chile]]; [[2016 OFC Nations Cup]] winners [[New Zealand national football team|New Zealand]]; and [[2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup]] champions the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] (for the first time since 1986) also failed to qualify.

Pot one contained the hosts Russia (who were automatically assigned to position A1) and the best seven teams.

the [[International Football Association Board]]'s decision to incorporate [[video assistant referee]]s (VARs) into the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the game]] (LOTG) on

/>\n\nVAR operations for all games were operated from a single headquarters in Moscow, which received live video of the games and were in radio contact with the on-field referees.<ref name=\":0\" /> Systems were in place for communicating VAR-related information to broadcasters and visuals on stadiums' large screens were used for the fans in attendance.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nVAR had a significant impact on several games.<ref name=\"nh0b0\" /> On 15&nbsp;June 2018, [[Diego Costa]]'s goal against Portugal became the first World Cup goal based on a VAR decision;<ref name=\"isPIb\" /> the first penalty as a result of a VAR decision was awarded to France in their match against Australia on 16&nbsp;June and resulted in a goal by [[Antoine Griezmann]].<ref name=\"iQyFC\" /> A record number of penalties were awarded in the tournament, a phenomenon partially attributed to VAR.<ref name=\"zeD2b\" /> Overall, the new technology was both praised and criticised by commentators.<ref name=\"neijv\" /> FIFA declared the implementation of VAR a success after the first week of competition.<ref name=\"swBxZ\" />\n\n==Venues==\nRussia proposed the following host cities: [[Kaliningrad]], [[Kazan]], [[Krasnodar]], [[Moscow]], [[Nizhny Novgorod]], [[Rostov-on-Don]], [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Samara]], [[Saransk]], [[Sochi]], [[Volgograd]], [[Yaroslavl]], and [[Yekaterinburg]].<ref name=\"b9r6N\" /> Each city was located in [[European Russia]], except [[Yekaterinburg]],<ref name=\"S3sSt\" /> which is located very close to the Europe-Asia border, to reduce travel time for the teams in the huge country. The bid evaluation report stated: \"The Russian bid proposes 13 host cities and 16 stadiums, thus exceeding FIFA's minimum requirement. Three of the 16 stadiums would be renovated, and 13 would be newly constructed.\"<ref name=\"Z1hqZ\" />\n\nIn October 2011, Russia reduced the number of stadiums from 16 to 14. Construction of the proposed [[Podolsk]] stadium in the Moscow region was cancelled by the regional government. Also, in the capital, [[Otkritie Arena]] was competing with [[VTB Arena|Dynamo Stadium]] over which would be constructed first.<ref name=\"8DESn\" />{{dead link|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe final choice of host cities was announced on 29&nbsp;September 2012. The number of cities was reduced further to 11 and the number of stadiums to 12 as Krasnodar and Yaroslavl were dropped from the final list. Of the 12 stadiums used for the tournament, three (Luzhniki, Yekaterinburg and Sochi) had been extensively renovated and the other nine were brand new; $11.8&nbsp;billion was spent on hosting the tournament.<ref name=\"VKrDx\" />\n\nSepp Blatter had said in July 2014 that, given the concerns over the completion of venues in Russia, the number of venues for the tournament may be reduced from 12 to 10.<ref name=\"Sy4OR\" /> He also said, \"We are not going to be in a situation, as is the case of one, two or even three stadiums [[2010 FIFA World Cup|in South Africa]], where it is a problem of what you do with these stadiums\".<ref name=\"saakov\" />\n[[File:EstadioCentral2017-01-26.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of the Yekaterinburg Central Stadium in January 2017]] \nIn October 2014, on their first official visit to Russia, FIFA's inspection committee and its head, Chris Unger, visited St. Petersburg, Sochi, Kazan and both Moscow venues. They were satisfied with the progress.<ref name=\"u01d8\" /> On 8&nbsp;October 2015, FIFA and the local organising committee agreed on the official names of the stadiums to be used during the tournament.<ref name=\"AL037\" /> Of the twelve venues, the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow and the Saint Petersburg Stadium\u2014the two largest stadiums in Russia\u2014were used most; both hosted seven matches. Sochi, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara each hosted six matches, including one quarter-final match each, while the Spartak Stadium in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don hosted five matches, including one round-of-16 match each. Volgograd, Kaliningrad, Yekaterinburg and Saransk each hosted four matches, but did not host any knockout stage games.\n\n===Stadiums===\n[[File:Bel-Tun (26).jpg|thumb|{{Center|Exterior of Otkrytie Arena}}{{Center| in Moscow}}]]\nTwelve stadiums in eleven Russian cities were built or renovated for the FIFA World Cup.

It hosted its first match on 5&nbsp;September 2014.\n* Nizhny Novgorod: Nizhny Novgorod Stadium (new). Construction of this stadium commenced in 2015 and was completed in December 2017.<ref name=\"L1mHo\" />\n* Rostov-on-Don: Rostov Arena (new).

The stadium in Saransk was scheduled to be commissioned in 2012 in time for the opening of the all-Russian [[Spartakiad]], but the plan was revised. The opening was rescheduled to 2017. The arena hosted its first match on 21&nbsp;April 2018.\n* Sochi: Fisht Stadium (renovated). This stadium hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of the [[2014 Winter Olympics]]. Afterwards, it was renovated in preparation for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2018 World Cup.\n* Volgograd: Volgograd Arena (new). The main Volgograd arena was built on the demolished [[Central Stadium (Volgograd)|Central Stadium]] site, at the foot of the [[Mamayev Kurgan]] memorial complex. It was commissioned on 3&nbsp;April 2018.<ref name=\"j2Lhd\" />\n* Yekaterinburg: Ekaterinburg Arena (renovated). The Central Stadium of Yekaterinburg had been renovated for the FIFA World Cup.

Russia has come across as friendly and hospitable: a stark contrast with the country's authoritarian image. All the foreign fans I have spoken to are pleasantly surprised.\"<ref name=\"91I71\" />\n\nFIFA president [[Gianni Infantino]] stated: \"Everyone discovered a beautiful country, a welcoming country, that is keen to show the world that everything that has been said before might not be true. A lot of preconceived ideas have been changed because people have seen the true nature of Russia.\"<ref name=\"kVyG9\" /> Infantino has proclaimed Russia 2018 to be \"the best World Cup ever\", as 98% of the stadiums were sold out, there were three billion viewers on TV around the world and seven million fans visited the fan fests.<ref name=\"kl1QG\" />\n\nHowever, the tournament was called a distraction from the international isolation and economic difficulties Russia has been facing.<ref name=\"FhofV\" /><ref name=\"ve3Sg\" /><ref name=\"M6MSu\" />\n\n==Broadcasting rights==\n{{Main|2018 FIFA World Cup broadcasting rights}}\nFIFA, through several companies, sold the broadcasting rights for the 2018 FIFA World Cup to various local broadcasters. After having tested the technology at limited matches of the [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup]],<ref name=\"wPguj\" /> and the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] (via private tests and public viewings in the host city of [[Rio de Janeiro]]),<ref name=\"kVsNi\" /> the 2018 World Cup was the first World Cup in which all matches were produced in [[4K resolution|4K]] [[Ultra-high-definition television|ultra high definition]]. Host Broadcast Services (HBS) stated that at least 75% of the broadcast cut of each match would come from 4K cameras (covering the majority of main angles), with instant replays and some camera angles being converted up from [[1080p]] high definition sources with limited degradation in quality. These broadcasts were made available from selected rightsholders and television providers.<ref name=\"TCu23\" /><ref name=\"0j6eE\" /><ref name=\"6j06c\" />\n\nIn February 2018, Ukrainian rightsholder [[UA:PBC]] stated that it would not broadcast the World Cup. This came in the wake of growing boycotts of the tournament among the [[Football Federation of Ukraine]] and sports minister [[Ihor Zhdanov]].<ref name=\"Xv82A\" /><ref name=\"0gvp3\" /> Additionally, the Football Federation of Ukraine refused to accredit journalists for the World Cup and waived their quota of tickets.<ref name=\"MLa57\" /> However, the Ukrainian state TV still broadcast the World Cup, and more than four million Ukrainians watched the opening match.<ref name=\"YqvyD\" />\n\nBroadcast rights to the tournament in the Middle East were hampered by an ongoing [[2017\u201318 Qatar diplomatic crisis|diplomatic crisis in Qatar]], which saw Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates cut diplomatic ties with Qatar\u2014the home country of FIFA's Middle East and Africa rightsholder [[beIN Sports]]\u2014in June 2017, over its [[Qatar and state-sponsored terrorism|alleged state support of terrorist groups]]. On 2&nbsp;June 2018, beIN pulled its channels from [[Du (company)|Du]] and [[Etisalat]], but with service to the latter restored later that day. Etisalat subsequently announced that it would air the World Cup in the UAE, and continue to offer beIN normally and without interruptions.<ref name=\"y5Kr4\" /><ref name=\"mvmPW\" /><ref name=\"jyl42\" /> In Saudi Arabia, beIN was banned from doing business; as a result, its channels and other content have been widely and illegally repackaged by a broadcaster identifying itself as \"[[beoutQ]]\". While FIFA attempted to negotiate the sale of a package consisting of Saudi matches and the final indirectly, they were unable to do so. On 12&nbsp;July 2018, FIFA stated that it had \"engaged counsel to take legal action in Saudi Arabia and is working alongside other sports rights owners that have also been affected to protect its interests.\"<ref name=\"NIzbW\" /><ref name=\"6N9LV\" />\n\nIn the United States, the 2018 World Cup was the first men's World Cup whose English rights were held by [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]], and Spanish rights held by [[Telemundo Deportes|Telemundo]]. The elimination of the United States in qualifying led to concerns that US interest and viewership of this World Cup would be reduced, noting that \"casual\" viewers of U.S. matches caused them to peak at 16.5&nbsp;million viewers in 2014, and how much Fox paid for the rights. During a launch event prior to the elimination, Fox stated that it had planned to place a secondary focus on the Mexican team in its coverage to take advantage of their popularity among [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]]. Fox stated that it was still committed to broadcasting a significant amount of tournament coverage.<ref name=\"lJrJH\" /><ref name=\"Oo1hn\" /><ref name=\"1M4WS\" /> Viewership was down overall over 2014; match scheduling was not as favourable to viewers in the Americas as it was in 2014. Many matches aired in the morning hours, although Telemundo's broadcast of the Mexico-Sweden Group F match was announced as being its most-watched weekday [[Daytime television|daytime]] program in network history.<ref name=\"wx1ZL\" /><ref name=\"UFMpG\" />\n\nUnlike previous tournaments, where the rights were bundled with those of South Korea, [[Korean Central Television]] acquired rights to the 2018 World Cup within North Korea. Broadcasts only began with the round of 16, and matches were tape delayed and edited for time. In addition, matches involving Japan were excluded from the broadcasts, due to [[Japan\u2013North Korea relations|strained relations and campaigns against the country]].<ref name=\"iscoP\"
