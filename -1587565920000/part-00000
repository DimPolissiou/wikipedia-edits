For developed countries, reduction of HCFC consumption and production began in 2004 and 2010, respectively, with 100% reduction set for 2020.

They are not found anywhere in nature. HCFC production began to take off after countries agreed to phase out the use of CFCs in the 1980s, which were found to be destroying the ozone layer. Like CFCs, HCFCs are used for refrigeration, aerosol propellants, foam manufacture and air conditioning. Unlike the CFCs, however, most HCFCs are broken down in the lowest part of the atmosphere and pose a much smaller risk to the ozone layer. Nevertheless, HCFCs are very potent [[greenhouse gas]]es, despite their very low atmospheric concentrations, measured in parts per trillion (million million).\n\nThe HCFCs are transitional CFCs replacements, used as [[refrigerant]]s, solvents, blowing agents for plastic foam manufacture, and fire extinguishers. In terms of [[ozone depletion potential]] (ODP), in comparison to CFCs that have ODP 0.6 \u2013 1.0, these HCFCs have lower ODPs (0.01 \u2013 0.5). In terms of [[global warming potential]] (GWP), in comparison to CFCs that have GWP 4,680 \u2013 10,720, HCFCs have lower GWPs (76 \u2013 2,270).\n\n=== Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) ===\n\nOn January 1, 2019 the [[Kigali accord|Kigali Amendment]] to the Montreal Protocol came into force.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ozone.unep.org/ozone-timeline|website=ozone.unep.org|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> Under the Kigali Amendment countries promised to reduce the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) by more than 80% over the next 30 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2001308090/kigali-amendment-heralds-new-dawn-for-climate-change-action|title=Kigali Amendment heralds new dawn for climate change action|last=Msuya|first=Joyce|website=The Standard|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> By December 27, 2018, 65 countries had ratified the Amendment.<ref name=\"standardmedia_Msuya_20190102\">{{Cite web| last = Msuya| first = Joyce |publisher=Standard Media| title = Kigali Amendment heralds new dawn for climate change action| work = The Standard| access-date=January 2, 2019| url = https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2001308090/kigali-amendment-heralds-new-dawn-for-climate-change-action |date=January 2, 2019}}</ref>\n\nProduced mostly in developed countries, [[Organofluorine chemistry#Hydrofluorocarbons|hydrofluorocarbons]] (HFCs) replaced CFCs and HCFCs.

They discovered that CFC molecules were stable enough to remain in the atmosphere until they got up into the middle of the [[stratosphere]] where they would finally (after an average of 50\u2013100 years for two common CFCs) be broken down by [[ultraviolet radiation]] releasing a [[chlorine]] atom. Rowland and Molina then proposed that these chlorine atoms might be expected to cause the breakdown of large amounts of ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) in the stratosphere. Their argument was based upon an analogy to contemporary work by [[Paul J. Crutzen]] and Harold Johnston, which had shown that nitric oxide (NO) could catalyze the destruction of ozone. (Several other scientists, including [[Ralph Cicerone]], Richard Stolarski, Michael McElroy, and Steven Wofsy had independently proposed that chlorine could catalyze ozone loss, but none had realized that CFCs were a potentially large source of chlorine.) Crutzen, Molina and Rowland were awarded the 1995 [[Nobel Prize for Chemistry]] for their work on this problem.\n\nThe environmental consequence of this discovery was that, since stratospheric ozone absorbs most of the ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation reaching the surface of the planet, depletion of the ozone layer by CFCs would lead to an increase in UV-B radiation at the surface, resulting in an increase in skin cancer and other impacts such as damage to crops and to marine phytoplankton.\n\nBut the Rowland-Molina hypothesis was strongly disputed by representatives of the aerosol and halocarbon industries. The chair of the board of [[DuPont]] was quoted as saying that ozone depletion theory is \"a science fiction tale...a load of rubbish...utter nonsense\". [[Robert Abplanalp]], the president of Precision Valve Corporation (and inventor of the first practical aerosol spray can valve), wrote to the Chancellor of UC Irvine to complain about Rowland's public statements (Roan, p.&nbsp;56.)\n\nAfter publishing their pivotal paper in June 1974, Rowland and Molina testified at a\nhearing before the U.S. House of Representatives in December 1974. As a result, significant funding was made available to study various aspects of the problem and to confirm the initial findings. In 1976, the U.S. [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS) released a report that confirmed the scientific credibility of the ozone depletion hypothesis.<ref name=\"NAS1976\">{{cite book | last = National Academy of Sciences | authorlink = United States National Academy of Sciences | title = Halocarbons, effects on stratospheric ozone | year = 1976 | location = Washington, DC | pages = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=a2YrAAAAYAAJ&dq=Halocarbons:+Effects+on+Stratospheric+Ozone | doi =  | isbn = }}</ref> NAS continued to publish assessments of related science for the next decade.\n\nThen, in 1985, [[British Antarctic Survey]] scientists [[Joe Farman]], [[Brian G. Gardiner (meteorologist)|Brian Gardiner]] and [[Jon Shanklin]] published results of abnormally low ozone concentrations above [[Halley Bay]] near the [[South Pole]]. They speculated that this was connected to increased levels of CFCs in the atmosphere. It took several other attempts to establish the Antarctic losses as real and significant, especially after NASA had retrieved matching data from its satellite recordings. The impact of these studies, the metaphor 'ozone hole', and the colourful visual representation in a time lapse animation proved shocking enough for negotiators in Montreal, Canada to take the issue seriously.<ref>Grundmann, Reiner, Transnational Environmental Policy: Reconstructing Ozone, London: Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415-22423-3}}</ref>\n\nAlso in 1985, 20 nations, including most of the major CFC producers, signed the [[Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer|Vienna Convention]], which established a framework for negotiating international regulations on ozone-depleting substances<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ozone.unep.org/treaties/vienna-convention|website=ozone.unep.org|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>. After the discovery of the ozone hole \nby SAGE 2 it only took 18 months to reach a binding agreement in Montreal, Canada.\n\nBut the CFC industry did not give up that easily. As late as 1986, the Alliance for Responsible CFC Policy (an association representing the CFC industry founded by [[DuPont]]) was still arguing that the science was too uncertain to justify any action. In 1987, DuPont testified before the US Congress that \"We believe there is no imminent crisis that demands unilateral regulation.\"<ref name=Doyle1991>{{cite news|last1=Doyle|first1=Jack|title=DuPont's Disgraceful Deeds: The Environmental Record of E.I.

Currently, 147 of the 196 Parties to the Montreal Protocol meet these criteria (they are referred to as Article 5 countries).\n\nIt embodies the principle agreed at the [[Earth Summit|United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] in 1992 that countries have a common but differentiated responsibility to protect and manage the global commons.\n\nThe Fund is managed by an Executive Committee with an equal representation of seven industrialized and seven Article 5 countries, which are elected annually by a Meeting of the Parties. The Committee reports annually to the Meeting of the Parties on its operations. The work of the Multilateral Fund on the ground in developing countries is carried out by four Implementing Agencies, which have contractual agreements with the Executive Committee:<ref>{{cite book|title=Creating a real change for the environment|year=2007|publisher=Secretariat of the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol|url=http://www.multilateralfund.org/InformationandMedia/publications/default.aspx}}</ref>\n\n* [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP), through its [[UNEP OzonAction|OzonAction Programme]].\n* [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP).\n* [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]] (UNIDO).\n* [[World Bank]].\n\nUp to 20 percent of the contributions of contributing parties can also be delivered through their bilateral agencies in the form of eligible projects and activities.\n\nThe fund is replenished on a three-year basis by the donors. Pledges amount to US$3.1 billion over the period 1991 to 2005. Funds are used, for example, to finance the conversion of existing manufacturing processes, train personnel, pay royalties and patent rights on new technologies, and establish national ozone offices.\n\n== Parties ==\nAs of 23 June 2015, all countries in the United Nations, the [[Cook Islands]], [[Holy See]], [[Niue]] as well as the [[European Union]] have ratified the original Montreal Protocol (see external link below),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXVII-2-a&chapter=27&lang=en |title=2. a Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer Montreal, 16 September 1987|publisher=United Nations |accessdate=25 August 2018}}</ref> with [[South Sudan]] being the last country to ratify the agreement, bringing the total to 197.

Also, the concentration of the HCFCs increased drastically at least partly because of many uses (e.g. used as solvents or refrigerating agents) CFCs were substituted with HCFCs. While there have been reports of attempts by individuals to circumvent the ban, e.g. by smuggling CFCs from undeveloped to developed nations, the overall level of compliance has been high. Statistical analysis from 2010 show a clear positive signal from the Montreal Protocol to the stratospheric ozone.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Evidence for the effectiveness of the Montreal Protocol to protect the ozone layer|journal=Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics |volume=10|issue=24|pages=12161\u201312171| date=22 December 2010 |doi=10.5194/acp-10-12161-2010|last1=M\u00e4der|first1=J.

The Montreal Protocol currently calls for a complete phase-out of HCFCs by 2030, but does not place any restriction on HFCs. Since the CFCs themselves are equally powerful greenhouse gases, the mere substitution of HFCs for CFCs does not significantly increase the rate of anthropogenic climate change, but over time a steady increase in their use could increase the danger that human activity will change the climate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/ggrpt/other_gases.html |title=EIA \u2013 Emissions of the Greenhouse Gases in the United States 2005 |publisher=www.eia.doe.gov |accessdate=2010-09-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110421074012/http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/ggrpt/other_gases.html |archivedate=21 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nPolicy experts have advocated for increased efforts to link ozone protection efforts to climate protection efforts.<ref>Mario Molina, Durwood Zaelke, K.

The phasing-out of the less damaging [[HCFC]]s only began in 1996 and will go on until a complete phasing-out is achieved by 2030.\n\nThere were a few exceptions for \"essential uses\" where no acceptable substitutes were initially found (for example, in the past metered dose inhalers commonly used to treat asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were exempt) or [[Halomethane|Halon]] fire suppression systems used in submarines and aircraft (but not in general industry).\n\nThe substances in Group I of Annex A are:\n\n* CFCl<sub>3</sub> ([[Trichlorofluoromethane|CFC-11]])\n* CF<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> ([[Dichlorodifluoromethane|CFC-12]])\n* C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>3</sub>Cl<sub>3</sub> ([[CFC-113]])\n* C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>([[CFC-114]])\n* C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>5</sub>Cl ([[CFC-115]])\n\nThe provisions of the Protocol include the requirement that the Parties to the Protocol base their future decisions on the current scientific, environmental, technical, and economic information that is assessed through panels drawn from the worldwide expert communities. To provide that input to the decision-making process, advances in understanding on these topics were assessed in 1989, 1991, 1994, 1998 and 2002 in a series of reports entitled [[Scientific assessment of ozone depletion]], by the Scientific Assessment Panel (SAP).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ozone.unep.org/en/assessment-panels/scientific-assessment-panel|title=Scientific Assessment Panel {{!}} OZONE SECRETARIAT|website=ozone.unep.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180424202422/http://ozone.unep.org/en/assessment-panels/scientific-assessment-panel|archive-date=24 April 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990 a Technology and Economic Assessment Panel was also established as the technology and economics advisory body to the Montreal Protocol Parties.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ozone.unep.org/en/assessment-panels/technology-and-economic-assessment-panel|title=Technology and Economic Assessment Panel {{!}} OZONE SECRETARIAT|website=ozone.unep.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180126070701/http://ozone.unep.org/en/assessment-panels/technology-and-economic-assessment-panel|archive-date=26 January 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Technology and Economic Assessment Panel (TEAP) provides, at the request of Parties, technical information related to the alternative technologies that have been investigated and employed to make it possible to virtually eliminate use of Ozone Depleting Substances (such as CFCs and Halons), that harm the ozone layer.

For developed countries, reduction of HCFC consumption and production began in 2004 and 2010, respectively, with 100% reduction set for 2020.  Developing countries agreed to start reducing its consumption and production of HCFCs by 2015, with 100% reduction set for 2030.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ozone.unep.org/montreal-protocol-substances-deplete-ozone-layer/32506|title=The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer|date=|website=United Nations Environment Programme|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=16 Nov 2018}}</ref>\n\nHydrochlorofluorocarbons, commonly known as HCFCs, are a group of man-made compounds containing hydrogen, chlorine, fluorine and carbon. They are not found anywhere in nature. HCFC production began to take off after countries agreed to phase out the use of CFCs in the 1980s, which were found to be destroying the ozone layer. Like CFCs, HCFCs are used for refrigeration, aerosol propellants, foam manufacture and air conditioning. Unlike the CFCs, however, most HCFCs are broken down in the lowest part of the atmosphere and pose a much smaller risk to the ozone layer. Nevertheless, HCFCs are very potent [[greenhouse gas]]es, despite their very low atmospheric concentrations, measured in parts per trillion (million million).\n\nThe HCFCs are transitional CFCs replacements, used as [[refrigerant]]s, solvents, blowing agents for plastic foam manufacture, and fire extinguishers. In terms of [[ozone depletion potential]] (ODP), in comparison to CFCs that have ODP 0.6 \u2013 1.0, these HCFCs have lower ODPs (0.01 \u2013 0.5). In terms of [[global warming potential]] (GWP), in comparison to CFCs that have GWP 4,680 \u2013 10,720, HCFCs have lower GWPs (76 \u2013 2,270).\n\n=== Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) ===\n\nOn January 1, 2019 the [[Kigali accord|Kigali Amendment]] to the Montreal Protocol came into force. Under the Kigali Amendment countries promised to reduce the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) by more than 80% over the next 30 years.

They discovered that CFC molecules were stable enough to remain in the atmosphere until they got up into the middle of the [[stratosphere]] where they would finally (after an average of 50\u2013100 years for two common CFCs) be broken down by [[ultraviolet radiation]] releasing a [[chlorine]] atom. Rowland and Molina then proposed that these chlorine atoms might be expected to cause the breakdown of large amounts of ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) in the stratosphere. Their argument was based upon an analogy to contemporary work by [[Paul J. Crutzen]] and Harold Johnston, which had shown that nitric oxide (NO) could catalyze the destruction of ozone. (Several other scientists, including [[Ralph Cicerone]], Richard Stolarski, Michael McElroy, and Steven Wofsy had independently proposed that chlorine could catalyze ozone loss, but none had realized that CFCs were a potentially large source of chlorine.) Crutzen, Molina and Rowland were awarded the 1995 [[Nobel Prize for Chemistry]] for their work on this problem.\n\nThe environmental consequence of this discovery was that, since stratospheric ozone absorbs most of the ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation reaching the surface of the planet, depletion of the ozone layer by CFCs would lead to an increase in UV-B radiation at the surface, resulting in an increase in skin cancer and other impacts such as damage to crops and to marine phytoplankton.\n\nBut the Rowland-Molina hypothesis was strongly disputed by representatives of the aerosol and halocarbon industries. The chair of the board of [[DuPont]] was quoted as saying that ozone depletion theory is \"a science fiction tale...a load of rubbish...utter nonsense\". [[Robert Abplanalp]], the president of Precision Valve Corporation (and inventor of the first practical aerosol spray can valve), wrote to the Chancellor of UC Irvine to complain about Rowland's public statements (Roan, p.&nbsp;56.)\n\nAfter publishing their pivotal paper in June 1974, Rowland and Molina testified at a\nhearing before the U.S. House of Representatives in December 1974. As a result, significant funding was made available to study various aspects of the problem and to confirm the initial findings. In 1976, the U.S. [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS) released a report that confirmed the scientific credibility of the ozone depletion hypothesis.<ref name=\"NAS1976\">{{cite book | last = National Academy of Sciences | authorlink = United States National Academy of Sciences | title = Halocarbons, effects on stratospheric ozone | year = 1976 | location = Washington, DC | pages = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=a2YrAAAAYAAJ&dq=Halocarbons:+Effects+on+Stratospheric+Ozone | doi =  | isbn = }}</ref> NAS continued to publish assessments of related science for the next decade.\n\nThen, in 1985, [[British Antarctic Survey]] scientists [[Joe Farman]], [[Brian G. Gardiner (meteorologist)|Brian Gardiner]] and [[Jon Shanklin]] published results of abnormally low ozone concentrations above [[Halley Bay]] near the [[South Pole]]. They speculated that this was connected to increased levels of CFCs in the atmosphere. It took several other attempts to establish the Antarctic losses as real and significant, especially after NASA had retrieved matching data from its satellite recordings. The impact of these studies, the metaphor 'ozone hole', and the colourful visual representation in a time lapse animation proved shocking enough for negotiators in Montreal, Canada to take the issue seriously.<ref>Grundmann, Reiner, Transnational Environmental Policy: Reconstructing Ozone, London: Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415-22423-3}}</ref>\n\nAlso in 1985, 20 nations, including most of the major CFC producers, signed the [[Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer|Vienna Convention]], which established a framework for negotiating international regulations on ozone-depleting substances. After the discovery of the ozone hole \nby SAGE 2 it only took 18 months to reach a binding agreement in Montreal, Canada.\n\nBut the CFC industry did not give up that easily. As late as 1986, the Alliance for Responsible CFC Policy (an association representing the CFC industry founded by [[DuPont]]) was still arguing that the science was too uncertain to justify any action. In 1987, DuPont testified before the US Congress that \"We believe there is no imminent crisis that demands unilateral regulation.\"<ref name=Doyle1991>{{cite news|last1=Doyle|first1=Jack|title=DuPont's Disgraceful Deeds: The Environmental Record of E.I.

Heckert would write in a letter to the United States Senate, \"we will not produce a product unless it can be made, used, handled and disposed of safely and consistent with appropriate safety, health and environmental quality criteria.

Currently, 147 of the 196 Parties to the Montreal Protocol meet these criteria (they are referred to as Article 5 countries).\n\nIt embodies the principle agreed at the [[Earth Summit|United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] in 1992 that countries have a common but differentiated responsibility to protect and manage the global commons.\n\nThe Fund is managed by an Executive Committee with an equal representation of seven industrialized and seven Article 5 countries, which are elected annually by a Meeting of the Parties. The Committee reports annually to the Meeting of the Parties on its operations. The work of the Multilateral Fund on the ground in developing countries is carried out by four Implementing Agencies, which have contractual agreements with the Executive Committee:<ref>{{cite book|title=Creating a real change for the environment|year=2007|publisher=Secretariat of the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol|url=http://www.multilateralfund.org/InformationandMedia/publications/default.aspx}}</ref>\n\n* [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP), through its [[UNEP OzonAction|OzonAction Programme]].\n* [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP).\n* [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]] (UNIDO).\n* [[World Bank]].\n\nUp to 20 percent of the contributions of contributing parties can also be delivered through their bilateral agencies in the form of eligible projects and activities.\n\nThe fund is replenished on a three-year basis by the donors. Pledges amount to US$3.1 billion over the period 1991 to 2005. Funds are used, for example, to finance the conversion of existing manufacturing processes, train personnel, pay royalties and patent rights on new technologies, and establish national ozone offices.\n\n== Parties ==\nAs of 23 June 2015, all countries in the United Nations, the [[Cook Islands]], [[Holy See]], [[Niue]] as well as the [[European Union]] have ratified the original Montreal Protocol (see external link below),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXVII-2-a&chapter=27&lang=en |title=2. a Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer Montreal, 16 September 1987|publisher=United Nations |accessdate=25 August 2018}}</ref> with [[South Sudan]] being the last country to ratify the agreement, bringing the total to 197.

Also, the concentration of the HCFCs increased drastically at least partly because of many uses (e.g. used as solvents or refrigerating agents) CFCs were substituted with HCFCs. While there have been reports of attempts by individuals to circumvent the ban, e.g. by smuggling CFCs from undeveloped to developed nations, the overall level of compliance has been high.

The Montreal Protocol currently calls for a complete phase-out of HCFCs by 2030, but does not place any restriction on HFCs. Since the CFCs themselves are equally powerful greenhouse gases, the mere substitution of HFCs for CFCs does not significantly increase the rate of anthropogenic climate change, but over time a steady increase in their use could increase the danger that human activity will change the climate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/ggrpt/other_gases.html |title=EIA \u2013 Emissions of the Greenhouse Gases in the United States 2005 |publisher=www.eia.doe.gov |accessdate=2010-09-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110421074012/http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/ggrpt/other_gases.html |archivedate=21 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nPolicy experts have advocated for increased efforts to link ozone protection efforts to climate protection efforts.<ref>Mario Molina, Durwood Zaelke, K.

The style differs from other forms of hardcore in terms of a faster tempo, usually above 200 BPM, and a loud & distorted offbeat bassline. \n\nIn the 1990s, [[drum machine]]s and [[Sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]] were used to make this style. As technology developed, [[digital audio workstation|DAWs]] such as [[Ableton]] and [[Cubase]] became the standard for production. Modern frenchcore is often performed with live musical performers and sampling alongside a DJ set.  \n\n==History==\n\nFrenchcore is a product of the [[rave]] and [[freetekno]] scenes in [[France]] dating back to the early 1990s. The first frenchcore act, Micropoint, was founded by DJ Radium and Al Core in 1992.

A frenchcore track typically either has a melody accompanied with the kick & bass harmonically, or the kick & bass on its own in a rhythm focused form. \n\nTempo wise, frenchcore is usually performed around at around 200 [[beats per minute]] with variation. Since frenchcore tracks are produced at different tempos and performers have to account for their timeslots and different types of events, the tempos within a frenchcore set can vary from 180 BPM all the way to 220 or more, with artists sometimes ending their performances with terrorcore or speedcore. Since uptempo hardcore lies in a similar BPM range, frenchcore artists often mix in uptempo tracks into their sets. Artists from both genres often perform on stage side by side together mixing both genres in one set. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theharddata.com/2018/02/05/bkjn-vs-partyraiser-review-20-january-2018/|title=BKJN VS.

King Edward promises to return lands to the nobility in exchange for their [[homage (feudal)|homage]]. After the formalities have ended, Bruce spars with Edward's heir, the [[Edward II of England|Prince of Wales]], and the King weds Bruce to his goddaughter, [[Elizabeth de Burgh]]. [[James Douglas, Lord of Douglas|James Douglas]] arrives to ask for the restoration of his ancestral lands but is dismissed by Edward, on the basis of the previous Lord Douglas's treason. The King and the Prince depart from Scotland, leaving its management to Comyn and Bruce, under the supervision of the Earl of Pembroke, [[Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Aymer de Valence]]. Elizabeth arrives to marry Bruce. On the wedding night, he respects his reluctant wife's wishes and delays the consummation. Bruce witnesses Englishmen conscripting his servants to the King's army. Not long after, his father, the [[Robert de Brus, 6th Lord of Annandale|Lord of Annandale]], passes away, lamenting the loss of his friendship with the King of England, while admitting it may have been a mistake to trust Edward.\n\nTwo years later, after collecting taxes, Bruce notes how unpopular the English are. There is rioting after the public display of the [[hanged, drawn and quartered|quartered]] body of [[William Wallace]], which spurs Bruce to plan another revolt. He discusses the issue with his family, who agree with him. Bruce tries to persuade John Comyn to join him, but the latter refuses and threatens to inform Edward about the plan. In a panic, Bruce stabs Comyn to death. The incident compels the clergy of Scotland to offer a pardon to Bruce, bargaining that he supports the Catholic Church in Scotland and he accepts the [[Crown of Scotland]]. Bruce accepts the deal, but King Edward soon hears of it. He declares Bruce an outlaw and, at his son's request, sends the Prince of Wales to crush the uprising, under the dragon banner, symbolizing the abandonment of chivalry and representing King Edward's order that no quarter to be shown to any supporter of Bruce.\n\nBruce calls a council of the nobles, where most refuse to break their oaths to Edward. Despite the lack of expected support, Bruce heads to [[Scone, Scotland|Scone]], where he is to be crowned. On the road, he encounters Douglas, who pledges his allegiance if Robert will help Douglas reclaim his birthright. In Scone, Bruce is crowned [[List of Scottish monarchs|king of Scots]]. The ambitious de Valence decides to move against Bruce before the Prince arrives. Bruce wishes to avoid bloodshed and challenges de Valence to single combat. De Valence accepts but insists on delaying the duel a day, as it is Sunday. During the night, at Methven, Bruce finally consummates his marriage, but the English launch a surprise attack. Bruce sends his wife and [[Marjorie Bruce]], to safety with his brother [[Nigel de Brus|Nigel]], and stays to fight a [[Battle of Methven|losing battle]], during which most of the Scottish army is killed. Bruce escapes with fifty men. The group takes [[Aonghus \u00d3g of Islay|Angus]]' advice and flees to [[Islay]]. While traveling there, [[John of Argyll|John MacDougall]] parleys with them. He is bitter about the murder of his cousin Comyn but allows the army to pass but later [[Battle of Loch Ryan|attacks]] Bruce's entourage as they're trying to cross [[Loch Ryan]]. Some of them get away in boats, but they cannot prevent the death of Robert the Bruce's brother [[Alexander de Brus|Alexander]].\n\nPrince Edward arrives in Scotland and searches for Bruce at [[Kildrummy Castle]], only to find Bruce's wife, daughter, and brother. The sadistic prince has his brother hanged and drawn, and has Bruce's daughter and wife taken to England. Bruce's company meets up with Lord Mackinnon, who refuses to lend them any men. The band presses on with their voyage to Islay anyway; there, they learn of the fall of Kildrummy Castle. Bruce decides to take back the castle through stealth. The successful operation inspires Bruce to begin [[guerilla warfare]]. Shortly thereafter, Bruce is reunited with his other brother, [[Thomas de Brus|Thomas]]. In England, Marjorie is separated from her stepmother Elizabeth to be given religious instruction by nuns. After Edward hears that [[Douglas Castle]] has been re-taken, he goes after Bruce himself. He offers Elizabeth a pardon if she will annul her marriage to Robert, but she refuses and is placed in a hanging cage.\n\nThe following year, King Edward dies shortly after arriving in Scotland, and the Prince of Wales takes control of his father's forces. In defiance of his father's dying wishes, he orders his late father's burial in Scotland. Bruce decides to fight the new king in a [[pitched battle]] at [[Loudoun Hill]], despite being outnumbered six to one. Clan Mackinnon arrives to aid Bruce. Edward's army is composed almost entirely of cavalry, so Robert overcomes this army's size disadvantage by ensuring that during [[Battle of Loudoun Hill|the battle]],  the English cavalry charge into a spear wall hidden by a ditch, and thus incur heavy losses. Many horsemen attempt to attack the flanks but become bogged down in the mud, just as the Scots anticipated. As the English knights fall from their horses, many are slain, and the battle becomes an open brawl, wherein the ferocious Scots prevail over the disoriented English soldiers. Realising the battle is hopeless, de Valence orders a retreat. However, determined to kill his nemesis, Edward does not join the retreat. Instead, he engages in a duel with Bruce as the Scots look on. Although Bruce prevails, he allows Edward to leave unharmed. The epilogue reveals that Elizabeth was released as a part of a hostage exchange. The Prince of Wales was crowned King Edward II, only to be killed by his own lords. Three hundred years later, Robert's [[James VI and I|descendant]] unified the [[Acts of Union 1707|crowns of England and Scotland]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Chris Pine]] as [[Robert the Bruce]]\n* [[Aaron Taylor-Johnson]] as [[James Douglas, Lord of Douglas]]<ref name=\"THR2\">{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2017/07/aaron-taylor-johnson-scottish-hero-james-douglas-outlaw-king-robert-the-bruce-chris-pine-1202137331/|title=Aaron Taylor-Johnson Plays Scottish hero James Douglas|last=Fleming Jri|first=Mike|date=27 July 2017|work= Deadline|access-date=27 July 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n* [[Florence Pugh]] as [[Elizabeth de Burgh]]<ref name=\"THR3\">{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2017/08/florence-pugh-outlaw-king-netflix-cast-1202144081/|title=Florence Pugh Nabs Lead in Netflix's 'Outlaw King'|last=Fleming Jri|first=Mike|date=7 August 2017|work= Deadline|access-date=7 August 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n* [[Billy Howle]] as [[Edward II of England|Edward, Prince of Wales]]<ref name=\"THR4\">{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2017/08/david-mackenzies-outlaw-king-billy-howle-netflix-1202152073/|title=David Mackenzie's 'Outlaw King' Adds Billy Howle|last=N'Duka|first=Amanda|date=18 August 2017|work= Deadline|access-date=18 August 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n*[[Tony Curran]] as [[Aonghus \u00d3g of Islay|Angus MacDonald]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/TonyCurran69/status/892173597795418112|title=Tony Curran on Twitter|date=31 July 2017|website=Twitter|access-date=30 August 2017}}</ref>\n* Lorne MacFadyen as [[Nigel de Brus|Neil Bruce]]\n* [[Alastair Mackenzie]] as Lord Atholl{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n* [[James Cosmo]] as [[Robert de Brus, 6th Lord of Annandale]]{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n* [[Callan Mulvey]] as [[John Comyn III, Lord of Badenoch]]<ref name=\"Callan\">{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/callan-mulvey-netflix-scottish-drama-outlaw-king-exclusive-1202550524/|title=Film News Roundup: Callan Mulvey Joins Chris Pine\u2019s Scottish Drama \u2018Outlaw King\u2019|date=7 September 2017|work=Variety|access-date=8 September 2017}}</ref>\n* Stephen McMillan as Drew Forfar, Squire\n* Paul Blair as [[William de Lamberton|Bishop Lamberton]]\n* [[Stephen Dillane]] as [[Edward I of England|King Edward I of England]]\n* [[Steven Cree]] as [[Christopher Seton]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/MrStevenCree/status/907232931680325633|title=Steven Cree on Twitter|date=11 September 2017|website=Twitter|access-date=28 September 2017}}</ref>\n*Kim Allan as [[Isabella MacDuff, Countess of Buchan]]\n* [[Sam Spruell]] as [[Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke]]\n* Rebecca Robin as [[Margaret of France, Queen of England]]\n* [[Jamie Maclachlan]] as Roger De Mowbray\n* [[Benny Young]] as [[Simon Fraser (died 1306)|Sir Simon Fraser]]\n* [[Clive Russell]] as Lord MacKinnon of Skye\n* [[Josie O'Brien]] as [[Marjorie Bruce]]\n\n==Production==\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on 28 August 2017 on location in both Scotland and England.

In truth, he began his rebellion a full year after  Wallace's death. During the intermediate period, Edward I became suspicious of Robert I and ordered him to stay at Kildrummy Castle.<ref name=\"dailyhistory\" />\n\nThe film shows Robert I marrying Elizabeth de Burgh after surrendering to Edward I. In reality, Bruce's second marriage occurred years before in 1302. \n\nThe film's depiction of Edward II's role in the Battle of Loudoun Hill is heavily flawed. It is unlikely that he was present at the battle in any capacity. Moreover, it is certain that he would not have challenged Bruce to [[single combat]]. Even if he had been present and challenged Bruce to personal combat, a hostage as valuable as Edward II would not have been allowed to flee.<ref name=\"dailyhistory\">{{cite web |url=https://www.dailyhistory.org/How_Historically_Accurate_is_the_Outlaw_King%3F |website=Dailyhistory|title=How Historically Accurate is the Outlaw King?|accessdate=30 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe title character in ''Outlaw King'' is that of an enigmatic and well-behaved man of the people who desires to restore Scotland to its inhabitants. However, historian Fiona Watson notes the real Robert I was most likely cold, canny, and driven by his personal ambition.<ref name=\"Scotsman\">{{cite web |last1=Finlay |first1=Greig |title=What 'Outlaw King' gets wrong - according to a historian |url=https://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/culture/film/what-outlaw-king-gets-wrong-according-to-a-historian-1-4829285 |website=Scotsman.com |language=en|accessdate=30 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe color yellow is mostly absent from the clothing of the fighting men. In contrast, yellow dye was not only the most common dye in Scotland during the period, it was highly favored by the fighters with the means to afford it. Historian Fergus Cannan notes that while many historical writers comment on its prevalence, it remains absent from appearances in popular culture related to Scottish history.<ref name=\"Ranker\">{{cite web |last1=Carlton |first1=Genevieve |title=Everything 'Outlaw King' Gets Wrong About History And Robert The Bruce |url=https://www.ranker.com/list/historical-inaccuracies-in-the-outlaw-king/genevieve-carlton |website=Ranker |language=en|accessdate=30 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe film depicts the character of Edward II as a cruel and oppressive person who is eager to succeed his father despite any historical evidence of Edward II having displayed such traits. On the contrary, Edward II was reluctant to assume the mantle of kingship and was known to be generous with his servants.<ref name=\"Ranker\" />\n\nThe film portrays Edward I dying before the battle of Loudoun Hill when, in actuality, he died several months later. Furthermore, the film implies that Edward I was buried where he died when, in fact, he was interred at Westminster Abbey in London.\n\nIn the film, when Robert I tells his brothers about his plan to start a rebellion, [[artichoke]]s can be seen on the table.

The film largely takes place during the 3-year historical period from 1304, when Bruce decides to rebel against the rule of [[Edward I]] over Scotland, thus becoming an \"outlaw\", up to the 1307 [[Battle of Loudoun Hill]].

King Edward promises to return lands to the nobility in exchange for their [[homage (feudal)|homage]]. After the formalities have ended, Bruce spars with Edward's heir, the [[Edward II of England|Prince of Wales]], and the King weds Bruce to his goddaughter, [[Elizabeth de Burgh]]. [[James Douglas, Lord of Douglas|James Douglas]] arrives to ask for the restoration of his ancestral lands but is dismissed by Edward, on the basis of the previous Lord Douglas's treason. The King and the Prince depart from Scotland, leaving its management to Comyn and Bruce, under the supervision of the Earl of Pembroke, [[Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Aymer de Valence]]. Elizabeth arrives to marry Bruce. On the wedding night, he respects his reluctant wife's wishes and delays the consummation. Bruce witnesses Englishmen conscripting his servants to the King's army. Not long after, his father, the [[Robert de Brus, 6th Lord of Annandale|Lord of Annandale]], passes away, lamenting the loss of his friendship with the King of England, while admitting it may have been a mistake to trust Edward.\n\nTwo years later, after collecting taxes, Bruce notes how unpopular the English are. There is rioting after the public display of the [[hanged, drawn and quartered|quartered]] body of [[William Wallace]], which spurs Bruce to plan another revolt. He discusses the issue with his family, who agree with him. Bruce tries to persuade John Comyn to join him, but the latter refuses and threatens to inform Edward about the plan. In a panic, Bruce stabs Comyn to death. The incident compels the clergy of Scotland to offer a pardon to Bruce, bargaining that he supports the Catholic Church in Scotland and he accepts the [[Crown of Scotland]]. Bruce accepts the deal, but King Edward soon hears of it. He declares Bruce an outlaw and, at his son's request, sends the Prince of Wales to crush the uprising, under the dragon banner, symbolizing the abandonment of chivalry and representing King Edward's order that no quarter to be shown to any supporter of Bruce.\n\nBruce calls a council of the nobles, where most refuse to break their oaths to Edward. Despite the lack of expected support, Bruce heads to [[Scone, Scotland|Scone]], where he is to be crowned. On the road, he encounters Douglas, who pledges his allegiance if Robert will help Douglas reclaim his birthright. In Scone, Bruce is crowned [[List of Scottish monarchs|king of Scots]]. The ambitious de Valence decides to move against Bruce before the Prince arrives. Bruce wishes to avoid bloodshed and challenges de Valence to single combat. De Valence accepts but insists on delaying the duel a day, as it is Sunday. During the night, at Methven, Bruce finally consummates his marriage, but the English launch a surprise attack. Bruce sends his wife and [[Marjorie Bruce]], to safety with his brother [[Nigel de Brus|Nigel]], and stays to fight a [[Battle of Methven|losing battle]], during which most of the Scottish army is killed. Bruce escapes with fifty men. The group takes [[Aonghus \u00d3g of Islay|Angus]]' advice and flees to [[Islay]]. While traveling there, [[John of Argyll|John MacDougall]] parleys with them. He is bitter about the murder of his cousin Comyn but allows the army to pass but later [[Battle of Loch Ryan|attacks]] Bruce's entourage as they're trying to cross [[Loch Ryan]]. Some of them get away in boats, but they cannot prevent the death of Robert the Bruce's brother [[Alexander de Brus|Alexander]].\n\nPrince Edward arrives in Scotland and searches for Bruce at [[Kildrummy Castle]], only to find Bruce's wife, daughter, and brother. The sadistic prince has his brother hanged and drawn, and has Bruce's daughter and wife taken to England. Bruce's company meets up with Lord Mackinnon, who refuses to lend them any men. The band presses on with their voyage to Islay anyway; there, they learn of the fall of Kildrummy Castle. Bruce decides to take back the castle through stealth. The successful operation inspires Bruce to begin [[guerilla warfare]]. Shortly thereafter, Bruce is reunited with his other brother, [[Thomas de Brus|Thomas]]. In England, Marjorie is separated from her stepmother Elizabeth to be given religious instruction by nuns. After Edward hears that [[Douglas Castle]] has been re-taken, he goes after Bruce himself. He offers Elizabeth a pardon if she will annul her marriage to Robert, but she refuses and is placed in a hanging cage.\n\nThe following year, King Edward dies shortly after arriving in Scotland, and the Prince of Wales takes control of his father's forces. In defiance of his father's dying wishes, he orders his late father's burial in Scotland. Bruce decides to fight the new king in a [[pitched battle]] at [[Loudoun Hill]], despite being outnumbered six to one. Clan Mackinnon arrives to aid Bruce. Edward's army is composed almost entirely of cavalry, so Robert overcomes this army's size disadvantage by ensuring that during [[Battle of Loudoun Hill|the battle]],  the English cavalry charge into a spear wall hidden by a ditch, and thus incur heavy losses. Many horsemen attempt to attack the flanks but become bogged down in the mud, just as the Scots anticipated. As the English knights fall from their horses, many are slain, and the battle becomes an open brawl, wherein the ferocious Scots prevail over the disoriented English soldiers. Realising the battle is hopeless, de Valence orders a retreat. However, determined to kill his nemesis, Edward does not join the retreat. Instead, he engages in a duel with Bruce as the Scots look on. Although Bruce prevails, he allows Edward to leave unharmed. The epilogue reveals that Elizabeth was released as a part of a hostage exchange. The Prince of Wales was crowned King Edward II, only to be killed by his own lords. Three hundred years later, Robert's [[James VI and I|descendant]] unified the [[Acts of Union 1707|crowns of England and Scotland]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Chris Pine]] as [[Robert the Bruce]]\n* [[Aaron Taylor-Johnson]] as [[James Douglas, Lord of Douglas]]<ref name=\"THR2\">{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2017/07/aaron-taylor-johnson-scottish-hero-james-douglas-outlaw-king-robert-the-bruce-chris-pine-1202137331/|title=Aaron Taylor-Johnson Plays Scottish hero James Douglas|last=Fleming Jri|first=Mike|date=27 July 2017|work= Deadline|access-date=27 July 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n* [[Florence Pugh]] as [[Elizabeth de Burgh]]<ref name=\"THR3\">{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2017/08/florence-pugh-outlaw-king-netflix-cast-1202144081/|title=Florence Pugh Nabs Lead in Netflix's 'Outlaw King'|last=Fleming Jri|first=Mike|date=7 August 2017|work= Deadline|access-date=7 August 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n* [[Billy Howle]] as [[Edward II of England|Edward, Prince of Wales]]<ref name=\"THR4\">{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2017/08/david-mackenzies-outlaw-king-billy-howle-netflix-1202152073/|title=David Mackenzie's 'Outlaw King' Adds Billy Howle|last=N'Duka|first=Amanda|date=18 August 2017|work= Deadline|access-date=18 August 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n*[[Tony Curran]] as [[Aonghus \u00d3g of Islay|Angus MacDonald]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/TonyCurran69/status/892173597795418112|title=Tony Curran on Twitter|date=31 July 2017|website=Twitter|access-date=30 August 2017}}</ref>\n* Lorne MacFadyen as [[Nigel de Brus|Neil Bruce]]\n* [[Alastair Mackenzie]] as Lord Atholl{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n* [[James Cosmo]] as [[Robert de Brus, 6th Lord of Annandale]]{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n* [[Callan Mulvey]] as [[John Comyn III, Lord of Badenoch]]<ref name=\"Callan\">{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/callan-mulvey-netflix-scottish-drama-outlaw-king-exclusive-1202550524/|title=Film News Roundup: Callan Mulvey Joins Chris Pine\u2019s Scottish Drama \u2018Outlaw King\u2019|date=7 September 2017|work=Variety|access-date=8 September 2017}}</ref>\n* Stephen McMillan as Drew Forfar, Squire\n* Paul Blair as [[William de Lamberton|Bishop Lamberton]]\n* [[Stephen Dillane]] as [[Edward I of England|King Edward I of England]]\n* [[Steven Cree]] as [[Christopher Seton]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/MrStevenCree/status/907232931680325633|title=Steven Cree on Twitter|date=11 September 2017|website=Twitter|access-date=28 September 2017}}</ref>\n*Kim Allan as [[Isabella MacDuff, Countess of Buchan]]\n* [[Sam Spruell]] as [[Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke]]\n* Rebecca Robin as [[Margaret of France, Queen of England]]\n* [[Jamie Maclachlan]] as Roger De Mowbray\n* [[Benny Young]] as [[Simon Fraser (died 1306)|Sir Simon Fraser]]\n* [[Clive Russell]] as Lord MacKinnon of Skye\n* [[Josie O'Brien]] as [[Marjorie Bruce]]\n\n==Production==\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on 28 August 2017 on location in both Scotland and England.

In truth, he began his rebellion a full year after  Wallace's death. During the intermediate period, Edward I became suspicious of Robert I and ordered him to stay at Kildrummy Castle.<ref name=\"dailyhistory\" />\n\nThe film shows Robert I marrying Elizabeth de Burgh after surrendering to Edward I. In reality, Bruce's second marriage occurred years before in 1302. \n\nThe film's depiction of Edward II's role in the Battle of Loudoun Hill is heavily flawed. It is unlikely that he was present at the battle in any capacity. Moreover, it is certain that he would not have challenged Bruce to [[single combat]]. Even if he had been present and challenged Bruce to personal combat, a hostage as valuable as Edward II would not have been allowed to flee.<ref name=\"dailyhistory\">{{cite web |url=https://www.dailyhistory.org/How_Historically_Accurate_is_the_Outlaw_King%3F |website=Dailyhistory|title=How Historically Accurate is the Outlaw King?|accessdate=30 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe title character in ''Outlaw King'' is that of an enigmatic and well-behaved man of the people who desires to restore Scotland to its inhabitants. However, historian Fiona Watson notes the real Robert I was most likely cold, canny, and driven by his personal ambition.<ref name=\"Scotsman\">{{cite web |last1=Finlay |first1=Greig |title=What 'Outlaw King' gets wrong - according to a historian |url=https://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/culture/film/what-outlaw-king-gets-wrong-according-to-a-historian-1-4829285 |website=Scotsman.com |language=en|accessdate=30 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe color yellow is mostly absent from the clothing of the fighting men. In contrast, yellow dye was not only the most common dye in Scotland during the period, it was highly favored by the fighters with the means to afford it. Historian Fergus Cannan notes that while many historical writers comment on its prevalence, it remains absent from appearances in popular culture related to Scottish history.<ref name=\"Ranker\">{{cite web |last1=Carlton |first1=Genevieve |title=Everything 'Outlaw King' Gets Wrong About History And Robert The Bruce |url=https://www.ranker.com/list/historical-inaccuracies-in-the-outlaw-king/genevieve-carlton |website=Ranker |language=en|accessdate=30 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe film depicts the character of Edward II as a cruel and oppressive person who is eager to succeed his father despite any historical evidence of Edward II having displayed such traits.

He wrote several books in [[Potawatomi]] and founded [[St. Ignatius, Montana|St. Ignatius]] Mission among the [[Kalispel Indians|Kalispel]]. Hoecken died of malaria sailing up the [[Missouri River]].\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Christiaan J. A. Hoeken (1808-1851).png|thumb|Christiaan J. A. Hoeken (1808-1851)]]\n\n===Dutch period===\nChristian Hoecken (born ''Christiaan Hoeken'') was the oldest son of Jacobus Hoeken and Johanna Vermeer. He was born in [[Tilburg]] (The Netherlands) and baptized the same day, February 28, 1808.<ref>https://www.openarch.nl/rat:2cd709de-3863-11e0-bcd1-8edf61960649,</ref> The Hoecken's were very religious; Jacobus was chairman of the parochial choir and all six children would leave the house joining a religious order.<ref name=Weijters>Cees Weijters, study of: C.Hoecken, A.Hoecken, C.Smarius, Regionaal Archief Tilburg, collection Weijters nr 422, inventory nr 8.</ref>\n\nChristian attended two Dutch catholic [[seminary|seminaries]] in his region (the nowadays southern province [[North Brabant|Noord-Brabant]]) namely [[Gymnasium Beekvliet|Beekvliet]] (1821) and Herlaar (1829). Hoecken was ordained a priest March 20, 1832.<ref name=Weijters/> He was then send to the United States 'to work among the [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]]' and 'strengthen the young catholic church oversea'. In September that year his ship set sail to [[Maryland]],<ref>Prayer card, printed by A van der Voort & Sons, Tilburg, The Netherlands, 1851 (see photo gallery)</ref> arriving there august 7. He would never see his parents again. Hoecken was a pioneer in the sense that many fathers and sisters from his home region followed him to the US, among which his younger brother [[Adrianus Hoecken|Adrian]].\n\n===Novitiate===\nHoecken settled at the [[Jesuit]] [[St. Stanislaus Seminary]] in [[Florissant, Missouri]], for his [[novitiate]]. In 1833 the mission among the Indians was entrusted to the Jesuits. In 1836 Hoecken was ready to go out and work as a missionary. He would work 15 years among the first nations and was one of the first companions of father [[Pierre-Jean De Smet|De Smet]].\n\n===Kickapoo mission===\nIn 1836 Hoecken started helping the [[Flanders|Flamish]] ([[Belgian]]) missionary [[Charles Felix Van Quickenborne|Van Quickenborne]] and three of his assistant fathers ([[Andrew Mazella]], [[Edmund Barry]] and [[George Miles (missionary)|George Miles]]) in founding a mission among the [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoos]] in nowadays [[Kansas]]. The mission post was installed at Salt Creek close to the [[Missouri river]], between two Indian settlements and 5 miles from the army post [[Fort Leavenworth]] (nowadays [[Kansas City]]). Hoeckens' group had a budget of 1.000 dollars of their superiors (the [[Jesuit]] order) and 500 dollars promised by the government (the [[Indian Commission]]) if and when a school would start. A school and a two-storey building were constructed indeed, but the mission failed. Few Kickapoo attended [[mass (liturgy)|mass]] and only 14 children were [[baptized]], that is in a camp just outside the fort in 1837. After the death of Van Quickenborne in august that year Hoecken remained a few months at the post, that was to be abandoned.<ref name=\"6AINLK\">[http://www.smac.edu/?TimeLine1827to1847 \"The History of St. Mary's Academy & College\"]</ref>\n\n===Potawatomi missions===\nHoecken succeeded Van Quickenborne at the Saint-Stanislaus mission among the [[Potawatomi]] on [[Osage River]], Kansas. He gave his flock lessons in [[agriculture]]. In 1838 Hoecken visited a group of 150 Potawatomi that were displaced from [[Wabash River]], Indiana, to southeastern Kansas. It took an eight days walk to reach the tribe and he visited them three times that year. In januari he stayed for two and a half weeks for the marriage of chief [[Nesswawke]]'s two daughters. He then returned in May and in October 1838. When he returned in May, the [[Jesuit]] fathers De Smet and [[Pierre Verhaegen]] were just establishing 'St. Joseph's Mission' at [[Council Bluffs]], Iowa.<ref name=\"K99TAK\">\"History of the Kickapoo mission and parish, the first Catholic church in Kansas\", par Wm. W. Graves, Gilbert J. Garraghan et George Towle, page 48 [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=wu.89064442692;view=1up;seq=68]</ref> But there was little succes in persuading the tribal members -sometimes called Bluff Indians- to convert to Christianity.\n\nIn November 1838 Hoecken took over the charge of [[Benjamin Petit|father Petit]] who had joined another group of Potawatomi in a forced 660 miles march to new reservation lands. [[St. Mary's Mission (Kansas)|St Mary's Mission]] at [[Sugar Creek (Missouri River)|Sugar Creek]], which he founded in 1839 by building a church and a school, was the true ending point of the [[Potawatomi Trail of Death]].<ref>McKee, \"The Centennial of 'The Trail of Death',\" pp. 27 and 39.</ref> Two years later [[Rose Philippine Duchesne|mother Duchesne]] joined this mission station in the eastern Kansas reservation. Father [[Felix Verreydt]] succeeded Hoecken at Sugar Creek, enabling him to visit other tribes in Kansas and the upper-Missouri region.\n\nIn a letter to his parents (dec 22, 1839) Hoecken refers to his first missionary activities speaking of the '[[Kickapoo people|Kieke-Paux]]' and the '[[Estawabiniers]]' on the river banks of the 'Osagis'. Many of the Indians were ill and Hoecken cared for them the best he could, baptizing some of them. Then, 'in another place', father Petit came to him with 750 'savages', including 350 catholic. Armed with a large axe father Hoecken took the lead and in three days a church was ready. But \"it was not more than a stable of Betlehem\", he writes. In March 1839 the Indians moved again to a place 14 miles away and by Lent, they were moving on again, with father Hoecken amidst them. He writes: \"At holy mass, the savages sang spiritual songs in their own language. I learned their language in a short time. After 2 or 3 months it was my duty to hear confession in their language. In the beginning it seems very difficult, but indeed it is not.\"\n\n===St.Ignatius and other missions===\nHoecken next visited the [[Ottawas]], strategically converted their chief, and tried to banish [[alcohol intoxication]] from among the tribe. After that he preached among the [[Sioux]], [[Gros Ventres]], [[Arikaree|Ricaree]], [[Mandans]], and [[Assiniboine people|Assiniboins]], of whom he reported to have baptized about 400 persons.\n\nIn 1843 Hoecken founded the mission of [[St. Ignatius, Montana|St. Ignatius]] among the [[Kalispel Indians|Kalispiels]]. He built a church thirty miles above the mouth of [[Clark Fork River|Clark's River]], and converted most of the tribe, at the same time teaching them to build [[log house]]s and sow grain. From this station he visited the [[Zingomenes]] and four other tribes, and completed the conversion of the [[Shuyelpi]] Indians that had been begun by father [[Pierre-Jean De Smet|De Smet]]. He then went to [[St. Louis]].\n\n=== Early death ===\nHoecken died of [[malaria]] at the age of 43 while sailing up the [[Missouri River]] back to his post in St. Louis, June 19, 1851. He was aboard the ''Saint-Ange'', a [[steamboat]] piloted by [[Joseph LaBarge]]<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bowdern |first=T.

Hoecken was in company of De Smet and a group of about 24 [[fur trade]]rs from Canada, Amerika, France, Ireland, Germany, Switzerland and Italy when 'different diseases' deployed, causing the death of nine passengers. The day before, Hoecken had taken [[confession]] of De Smet, who was seriously ill as well; but De Smet recovered.<ref>https://g-geschiedenis.eu/2015/09/21/zwartrok-bij-de-roodhuiden/ article 21-09-2015</ref> From [[St. Louis University]] the latter wrote a detailed report of father Hoecken's death to [[University of Lyon|Lyon]] and [[University of Paris|Paris]], the Jezuit centres in France. \nHoecken was provisionally buried near [[Council Bluffs]]. One month later he was interred alongside with his confr\u00e8res at the [[St. Stanislaus Seminary|Jesuit seminary in Florissant]].<ref>''Lettre du R.P.P.J.de Smet, de la Compagnie de J\u00e9sus \u00e0 MM les Membres des Conseils centraux de Lyon et de Paris.

In 1833 the mission among the Indians was entrusted to the Jesuits. In 1836 Hoecken was ready to go out and work as a missionary. He would work 15 years among the first nations and was one of the first companions of father [[Pierre-Jean De Smet|De Smet]]. \n\n===Kickapoo mission===\nIn 1836 Hoecken started helping the [[Flanders|Flamish]] ([[Belgian]]) missionary [[Charles Felix Van Quickenborne|Van Quickenborne]] and three of his assistant fathers ([[Andrew Mazella]], [[Edmund Barry]] and [[George Miles (missionary)|George Miles]]) in founding a mission among the [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoos]] in nowadays [[Kansas]]. The mission post was installed at Salt Creek close to the [[Missouri river]], between two Indian settlements and 5 miles from the army post [[Fort Leavenworth]] (nowadays [[Kansas City]]). Hoeckens' group had a budget of 1.000 dollars of their superiors (the [[Jesuit]] order) and 500 dollars promised by the government (the [[Indian Commission]]) if and when a school would start. A school and a two-storey building were constructed indeed, but the mission failed. Few Kickapoo attended [[mass]] and only 14 children were [[baptized]], that is in a camp just outside the fort in 1837. After the death of Van Quickenborne in august that year Hoecken remained a few months at the post, that was to be abandoned.<ref name=\"6AINLK\">\"The History of St. Mary's Academy & College\" [http://www.smac.edu/?TimeLine1827to1847]</ref> \n\n===Potawatomi missions===\nHoecken succeeded Van Quickenborne at the Saint-Stanislaus mission among the [[Potawatomi]] on [[Osage River]], Kansas. He gave his flock lessons in [[agriculture]]. In 1838 Hoecken visited a group of 150 Potawatomi that were displaced from [[Wabash River]], Indiana, to southeastern Kansas. It took an eight days walk to reach the tribe and he visited them three times that year. In januari he stayed for two and a half weeks for the marriage of chief [[Nesswawke]]'s two daughters. He then returned in May and in October 1838. When he returned in May, the [[Jesuit]] fathers De Smet and [[Pierre Verhaegen]] were just establishing 'St. Joseph's Mission' at [[Council Bluffs]], Iowa.<ref name=\"K99TAK\">\"History of the Kickapoo mission and parish, the first Catholic church in Kansas\", par Wm. W. Graves, Gilbert J. Garraghan et George Towle, page 48 [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=wu.89064442692;view=1up;seq=68]</ref> But there was little succes in persuading the tribal members -sometimes called Bluff Indians- to convert to Christianity.\n\nIn November 1838 Hoecken took over the charge of [[Benjamin Petit|father Petit]] who had joined another group of Potawatomi in a forced 660 miles march to new reservation lands. [[St. Mary's Mission (Kansas)|St Mary's Mission]] at [[Sugar Creek (Missouri River)|Sugar Creek]], which he founded in 1839 by building a church and a school, was the true ending point of the [[Potawatomi Trail of Death]].<ref>McKee, \"The Centennial of 'The Trail of Death',\" pp. 27 and 39.</ref> Two years later [[Rose Philippine Duchesne|mother Duchesne]] joined this mission station in the eastern Kansas reservation. Father [[Felix Verreydt]] succeeded Hoecken at Sugar Creek, enabling him to visit other tribes in Kansas and the upper-Missouri region.\n\nIn a letter to his parents (dec 22, 1839) Hoecken refers to his first missionary activities speaking of the '[[Kickapoo people|Kieke-Paux]]' and the '[[Estawabiniers]]' on the river banks of the 'Osagis'. Many of the Indians were ill and Hoecken cared for them the best he could, baptizing some of them. Then, 'in another place', father Petit came to him with 750 'savages', including 350 catholic. Armed with a large axe father Hoecken took the lead and in three days a church was ready. But \"it was not more than a stable of Betlehem\", he writes. In March 1839 the Indians moved again to a place 14 miles away and by Lent, they were moving on again, with father Hoecken amidst them. He writes: \"At holy mass, the savages sang spiritual songs in their own language. I learned their language in a short time. After 2 or 3 months it was my duty to hear confession in their language. In the beginning it seems very difficult, but indeed it is not.\"\n\n===St.Ignatius and other missions===\nHoecken next visited the [[Ottawas]], strategically converted their chief, and tried to banish [[alcohol intoxication]] from among the tribe. After that he preached among the [[Sioux]], [[Gros Ventres]], [[Arikaree|Ricaree]], [[Mandans]], and [[Assiniboine people|Assiniboins]], of whom he reported to have baptized about 400 persons.\n\nIn 1843 Hoecken founded the mission of [[St. Ignatius, Montana|St. Ignatius]] among the [[Kalispel Indians|Kalispiels]]. He built a church thirty miles above the mouth of [[Clark Fork River|Clark's River]], and converted most of the tribe, at the same time teaching them to build [[log house]]s and sow grain. From this station he visited the [[Zingomenes]] and four other tribes, and completed the conversion of the [[Shuyelpi]] Indians that had been begun by father [[Pierre-Jean De Smet|De Smet]]. He then went to [[St. Louis]].\n\n=== Early death ===\nHoecken died of [[malaria]] at the age of 43 while sailing up the [[Missouri River]] back to his post in St. Louis, June 19, 1851. He was aboard the ''Saint-Ange'', a [[steamboat]] piloted by [[Joseph LaBarge]]<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bowdern |first=T.

Hoecken was in company of De Smet and a group of about 24 [[fur trade]]rs from Canada, Amerika, France, Ireland, Germany, Switzerland and Italy when 'different diseases' deployed, causing the death of nine passengers. The day before, Hoecken had taken [[confession]] of De Smet, who was seriously ill as well; but De Smet recovered.<ref>https://g-geschiedenis.eu/2015/09/21/zwartrok-bij-de-roodhuiden/ article 21-09-2015</ref> From [[St. Louis University]] the latter wrote a detailed report of father Hoecken's death to [[University of Lyon|Lyon]] and [[University of Paris|Paris]], the Jezuit centres in France. \nHoecken was provisionally buried near [[Council Bluffs]]. One month later he was interred alongside with his confr\u00e8res at the [[St. Stanislaus Seminary|Jesuit seminary in Florissant]].<ref>''Lettre du R.P.P.J.de Smet, de la Compagnie de J\u00e9sus \u00e0 MM les Membres des Conseils centraux de Lyon et de Paris.

He first gave notice of his rising talent by taking part in two title fights (albeit unsuccessful) for the World Kickboxing Network (W.K.N) European and world titles in 2001 and 2002 respectively.

As a member of the strongest [[Muay Thai]] gym in [[Belarus]] and possibly [[Europe]], he gained experience from training alongside champions such as [[Andrei Kulebin]], [[Dmitry Shakuta]], [[Dmitry Valent]], [[Vasily Shish]] and Aliaksei Pekarchyk.  He first gave notice of his rising talent by taking part in two title fights (albeit unsuccessful) for the World Kickboxing Network (W.K.N) European and world titles in 2001 and 2002 respectively.  Andrei also competed in amateur competition, picking up a silver medal at the amateur European championships held in Cyprus in 2002<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://www.muaythaitv.com/pages/fighters/fighter.php?s_id=257\n| title=Andrei KOTSUR - MUAYTHAITV (mentions I.M.T.F. championships win in titles section)\n| last= \n| first= \n| accessdate=2011-07-07\n| publisher=www.muaythaitv.com\n}}</ref> as well as winning gold two years later at the [[World Association of Kickboxing Organizations|W.A.K.O.]] European championships in [[Budva]].\n\nIn 2003 Andrei won his first pro title, winning an eight-man tournament in Italy to win up the \"King of the Ring\" European grand prix at 65&nbsp;kg (143&nbsp;lbs).<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://www.kingsmuaythai.com/index_en/k_fighter03_en.php\n| title=History of Gym \"Kick Fighter\" 2003 (mentions winning King of the Ring title)\n| last= \n| first= \n| accessdate=2011-07-07\n| publisher=www.kingsmuaythai.com\n}}</ref>  He  then followed this up by going to Australia where he defeated Australian based [[Thai people|Thai]] Rhino Pichitchai to claim the I.M.T.F. World Profi Cup.  More titles followed the next year as Andrei won first the W.K.N. European title, giving him a shot against world champion Dan Rawlings, who he promptly defeated by decision when the United States team came to Belarus.  The following year Andrei gained revenge against a previous opponent who had defeated him, knocking out nine time world champion Osman Yigin in the second round of their match to hold on to his W.K.N. world title.  Another successful defence followed as Andrei headed to [[Turin, Italy]] where he finished the Italian challenger via a brutal flurry of elbows in the third round.\n\nIn 2006 Andrei headed to [[England]] where he faced [[World Association of Kickboxing Organizations|WAKO-Pro]] world champion Kieran Keddle in a bout for the vacant W.P.K.L. world title.  Andrei was unsuccessful after five rounds as the English fighter dominated him but despite the loss would take part in a number of cards across the country over the next couple of years, defeating the likes of Richard Cadden and Nico Verresen but losing to Luke Turner in what was quite an upset as Luke was an upcoming fighter who was standing in for Kostur's original opponent multiple world champion [[Liam Harrison (kickboxer)|Liam Harrison]].<ref>\n{{cite web\n| url=http://www.badcompany.co.uk/article.asp?newsid=364\n| title=Congratulations Luke Turner - The story of Rocky Balboa!\n| accessdate=2011-07-07\n| work=badcompany.co.uk\n| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326173542/http://www.badcompany.co.uk/article.asp?newsid=364\n| archive-date=2012-03-26\n| url-status=dead\n}}\n</ref>  Sandwiched between the matches in England was a loss against legendary Full-Contact champion Samir Mohammed in [[Paris]] and a victory over a Thai opponent to claim the W.P.K.A. world title, both in 2009.\n\nAndrei returned to England in 2010, winning an eight-man tournament in Birmingham where he defeated three local fighters in one night to be crowned champion.  He also faced and lost to a [[Thai people|Thai]] fighter Prathet Sor Thannikel at a Muay Thai show in [[Crawley]].  He is currently looking to take part in the W.K.N.
