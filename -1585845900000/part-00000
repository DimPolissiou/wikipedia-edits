Hundreds? Can anyone find this?

circulating in the blood.<ref name=\"Molina2018\"/> Over the initial weeks of infection, parasite replication is brought under control by the production of [[antibodies]] and the activation of the

The episode was reported by Darwin in his diaries of [[the Voyage of the Beagle]] as occurring in March 1835 to the east of the [[Andes]] near [[Mendoza Province|Mendoza]]. Darwin was young and generally in good health, though six months previously he had been ill for a month near [[Valparaiso]], but in 1837, almost a year after he returned to England, he began to suffer intermittently from a strange group of [[symptom]]s, becoming incapacitated for much of the rest of his life.

In the Twentieth Century the designation was used for a temporary expeditionary formation of the [[British Army during the Second World War]]. Initially there were ten Independent Companies, who were raised from volunteers from [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] divisions in April 1940. They were intended for [[guerrilla]]-style operations in the [[Allied campaign in Norway]]. The companies were disbanded after returning to Britain at the end of the campaign but another company, No. 11 Company, was formed from volunteers from the first ten Independent Companies on 14 June 1940, and took part in the first British commando raid, [[Operation Collar (commando raid)|Operation Collar]].<ref name=mo13>Moreman, p.13</ref>\n\n==Origins==\nEarly in 1940, the British Army had been making plans for a campaign in Norway, ostensibly to support [[Finland]] in the [[Winter War]] against Russia, who then had a [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|pact of alliance]] with Germany. When the Finns capitulated on 12 March 1940, the troops assigned to the operation were instead sent to France.<ref name=Wilkinson50>Wilkinson and Astley (2010), p.50</ref> Nevertheless, contingency planning continued. As part of this, [[Special Operations Executive|MI(R)]], a department of the [[War Office]] responsible for irregular operations, was asked to plan for raids on the Norwegian coast. The department's head, Colonel J.C.F Holland, summoned Lieutenant Colonel [[Colin Gubbins]], leading MI(R)'s mission in Paris, to prepare and train the troops.<ref name=Wilkinson50/>\n\nOn 9 April, the Germans launched [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung]], occupying [[Oslo]] and [[Narvik]] and several other ports in Norway, taking the allies by surprise. On 13 April, Holland submitted MI(R)'s first proposals to the War Office. He intended to break up the [[Lovat Scouts]] to form the raiding parties. However, the Scouts' commanding officer (Lieutenant Colonel Leslie Melville) objected, and instead Holland proposed to form the Independent Companies.<ref name=Wilkinson50/>\n\n==Companies==\nTen companies were formed from volunteers from [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] divisions still stationed in Great Britain:<ref>http://www.commandoveterans.org (Retrieved 8 Mar 2012)</ref>\n\n* No. 1 Independent Company formed from [[52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division]]\n* No. 2 Independent Company formed from [[53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division]]\n* No. 3 Independent Company formed from [[54th (East Anglian) Infantry Division]]\n* No. 4 Independent Company formed from [[55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division|55th (West Lancashire) Motor Division]]\n* No. 5 Independent Company formed from [[56th (London) Infantry Division|1st (London) Division]]\n* No. 6 Independent Company formed from [[9th (Highland) Infantry Division]]\n* No. 7 Independent Company formed from [[15th (Scottish) Infantry Division]]\n* No. 8 Independent Company formed from [[18th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|18th (East Anglian) Infantry Division]]\n* No. 9 Independent Company formed from [[38th (Welsh) Infantry Division]]\n* No. 10 Independent Company formed from [[66th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|66th Infantry Division]]\n\nThe establishment of each company was 21 officers and 268 other ranks,<ref name=\"mo13\"/> organised as three platoons, each of three sections. Some personnel from the [[Royal Engineers]] and [[Royal Corps of Signals|Royal Signals]] were attached to each company headquarters. As the companies were intended to be mobile in rough terrain and to operate independently for several days, they were lightly equipped. Each company's only heavy weapons were [[Bren light machine gun]]s, a single [[Boys anti-tank rifle]] and some [[2-inch mortar]]s in a Support section. The companies therefore were unsuitable for holding fixed defences or mounting rearguard actions.<ref name=Wilkinson51>Wilkinson and Astley (2010), p.51</ref>\n\nGubbins realised that the soldiers and junior officers of the newly raised companies were untrained in mountain and irregular warfare. He therefore requested that twenty picked officers of the [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]], with experience of the [[Military history of the North-West Frontier|North-West Frontier]], be attached to the Independent Companies. The selected officers flew from [[Karachi]] to Britain aboard the [[Imperial Airways]] flying boat ''Cathay''.<ref>{{cite book| last=Milton| first=Giles| authorlink=Giles Milton| title=The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare| year=2016| publisher=[[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]]| location=London| isbn=978-1-444-79895-1| page=53}}</ref>\n\n==Norwegian Campaign==\n{{main|Actions in Nordland}}\nFormal approval for the establishment of the Independent Companies was given only on 20 April. No. 1 Independent Company nevertheless first embarked for Norway on 27 April.<ref name=Wilkinson50/>\n\nOn 2 May, Gubbins was given command of \"Scissorsforce\", consisting of Nos. 1, 3, 4, and 5 Independent Companies, and ordered to prevent the Germans occupying [[Bod\u00f8]], [[Mo i Rana|Mo]] and [[Mosj\u00f8en]]. Part of the force (Nos. 4 and 5 Independent Companies) arrived at Mosj\u00f8en on 8 May. Early on 10 May, they successfully ambushed the leading Germans advancing on Mosj\u00f8en from the south, but were harassed by [[Luftwaffe]] aircraft during the long daylight hours and were outmatched by the main body of German ''[[Gebirgsj\u00e4ger]]'' (mountain troops). Exhausted, they were withdrawn by a Norwegian coaster to Bod\u00f8 on 11 May.<ref>Wilkinson and Astley, pp.52\u201353</ref>\n\nOn 10 May also, 300 ''Gebirgsj\u00e4ger'' with two mountain guns disembarked from the commandeered coaster {{SS|Nordnorge|1923|2}} at [[Hemnesberget]], roughly midway between Mosj\u00f8en and Mo. A platoon of No. 1 Independent Company and some Norwegian reservists defending the town were outnumbered and forced to escape by boat after a stiff resistance. No. 1 Independent Company and some Norwegian troops attacked the next day but failed to dislodge the Germans, who had been reinforced and resupplied by seaplanes.<ref>Adams (1989), pp.73\u201374</ref>\n\nGubbins's force was then placed under the command of [[24th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|24th (Guards) Brigade]] at Bod\u00f8. The destroyer carrying the brigade's commander (Brigadier [[William Fraser (British Army officer)|William Fraser]]) was put out of action by the Luftwaffe, and Gubbins assumed command of the brigade.<ref>Wilkinson and Astley (2010), p.54</ref> Nos. 1 and 3 Independent Companies of the former \"Scissorsforce\", reinforced by No. 2 Independent Company which had recently landed at Bod\u00f8,<ref>Wilkinson and Astley (2010), p.62</ref> thereafter generally fought in rearguard actions while attached to the brigade's infantry units in several [[actions in Nordland]], until all British troops were withdrawn from Bod\u00f8 in the early hours of 1 June.<ref>Wilkinson and Astley (2010), p.66</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe ten Independent Companies were disbanded after the Norwegian campaign. While most of their men were returned to their parent units and formations, calls were being made throughout the Army for men to join the new [[British Commandos|Commando]] units.

In the Twentieth Century the designation was used for a temporary expeditionary formation of the [[British Army during the Second World War]]. Initially there were ten Independent Companies, who were raised from volunteers from [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] divisions in April 1940. They were intended for [[guerrilla]]-style operations in the [[Allied campaign in Norway]]. The companies were disbanded after returning to Britain at the end of the campaign but another company, No. 11 Company, was formed from volunteers from the first ten Independent Companies on 14 June 1940, and took part in the first British commando raid, [[Operation Collar (commando raid)|Operation Collar]].<ref name=mo13>Moreman, p.13</ref>\n\n==Origins==\nEarly in 1940, the British Army had been making plans for a campaign in Norway, ostensibly to support [[Finland]] in the [[Winter War]] against Russia, who then had a [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|pact of alliance]] with Germany. When the Finns capitulated on 12 March 1940, the troops assigned to the operation were instead sent to France.<ref name=Wilkinson50>Wilkinson and Astley (2010), p.50</ref> Nevertheless, contingency planning continued. As part of this, [[Special Operations Executive|MI(R)]], a department of the [[War Office]] responsible for irregular operations, was asked to plan for raids on the Norwegian coast. The department's head, Colonel J.C.F Holland, summoned Lieutenant Colonel [[Colin Gubbins]], leading MI(R)'s mission in Paris, to prepare and train the troops.<ref name=Wilkinson50/>\n\nOn 9 April, the Germans launched [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung]], occupying [[Oslo]] and [[Narvik]] and several other ports in Norway, taking the allies by surprise. On 13 April, Holland submitted MI(R)'s first proposals to the War Office. He intended to break up the [[Lovat Scouts]] to form the raiding parties. However, the Scouts' commanding officer (Lieutenant Colonel Leslie Melville) objected, and instead Holland proposed to form the Independent Companies.<ref name=Wilkinson50/>\n\n==Companies==\nTen companies were formed from volunteers from [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] divisions still stationed in Great Britain:<ref>http://www.commandoveterans.org (Retrieved 8 Mar 2012)</ref>\n\n* No. 1 Independent Company formed from [[52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division]]\n* No. 2 Independent Company formed from [[53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division]]\n* No. 3 Independent Company formed from [[54th (East Anglian) Infantry Division]]\n* No. 4 Independent Company formed from [[55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division|55th (West Lancashire) Motor Division]]\n* No. 5 Independent Company formed from [[56th (London) Infantry Division|1st (London) Division]]\n* No. 6 Independent Company formed from [[9th (Highland) Infantry Division]]\n* No. 7 Independent Company formed from [[15th (Scottish) Infantry Division]]\n* No. 8 Independent Company formed from [[18th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|18th (East Anglian) Infantry Division]]\n* No. 9 Independent Company formed from [[38th (Welsh) Infantry Division]]\n* No. 10 Independent Company formed from [[66th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|66th Infantry Division]]\n\nThe establishment of each company was 21 officers and 268 other ranks,<ref name=\"mo13\"/> organised as three platoons, each of three sections. Some personnel from the [[Royal Engineers]] and [[Royal Corps of Signals|Royal Signals]] were attached to each company headquarters. As the companies were intended to be mobile in rough terrain and to operate independently for several days, they were lightly equipped. Each company's only heavy weapons were [[Bren light machine gun]]s, a single [[Boys anti-tank rifle]] and some [[2-inch mortar]]s in a Support section. The companies therefore were unsuitable for holding fixed defences or mounting rearguard actions.<ref name=Wilkinson51>Wilkinson and Astley (2010), p.51</ref>\n\nGubbins realised that the soldiers and junior officers of the newly raised companies were untrained in mountain and irregular warfare. He therefore requested that twenty picked officers of the [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]], with experience of the [[Military history of the North-West Frontier|North-West Frontier]], be attached to the Independent Companies. The selected officers flew from [[Karachi]] to Britain aboard the [[Imperial Airways]] flying boat ''Cathay''.<ref>{{cite book| last=Milton| first=Giles| authorlink=Giles Milton| title=The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare| year=2016| publisher=[[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]]| location=London| isbn=978-1-444-79895-1| page=53}}</ref>\n\n==Norwegian Campaign==\n{{main|Actions in Nordland}}\nFormal approval for the establishment of the Independent Companies was given only on 20 April. No. 1 Independent Company nevertheless first embarked for Norway on 27 April.<ref name=Wilkinson50/>\n\nOn 2 May, Gubbins was given command of \"Scissorsforce\", consisting of Nos. 1, 3, 4, and 5 Independent Companies, and ordered to prevent the Germans occupying [[Bod\u00f8]], [[Mo i Rana|Mo]] and [[Mosj\u00f8en]]. Part of the force (Nos. 4 and 5 Independent Companies) arrived at Mosj\u00f8en on 8 May. Early on 10 May, they successfully ambushed the leading Germans advancing on Mosj\u00f8en from the south, but were harassed by [[Luftwaffe]] aircraft during the long daylight hours and were outmatched by the main body of German ''[[Gebirgsj\u00e4ger]]'' (mountain troops). Exhausted, they were withdrawn by a Norwegian coaster to Bod\u00f8 on 11 May.<ref>Wilkinson and Astley, pp.52\u201353</ref>\n\nOn 10 May also, 300 ''Gebirgsj\u00e4ger'' with two mountain guns disembarked from the commandeered coaster {{SS|Nordnorge|1923|2}} at [[Hemnesberget]], roughly midway between Mosj\u00f8en and Mo. A platoon of No. 1 Independent Company and some Norwegian reservists defending the town were outnumbered and forced to escape by boat after a stiff resistance. No. 1 Independent Company and some Norwegian troops attacked the next day but failed to dislodge the Germans, who had been reinforced and resupplied by seaplanes.<ref>Adams (1989), pp.73\u201374</ref>\n\nGubbins's force was then placed under the command of [[24th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|24th (Guards) Brigade]] at Bod\u00f8. The destroyer carrying the brigade's commander (Brigadier [[William Fraser (British Army officer)|William Fraser]]) was put out of action by the Luftwaffe, and Gubbins assumed command of the brigade.<ref>Wilkinson and Astley (2010), p.54</ref> Nos. 1 and 3 Independent Companies of the former \"Scissorsforce\", reinforced by No. 2 Independent Company which had recently landed at Bod\u00f8,<ref>Wilkinson and Astley (2010), p.62</ref> thereafter generally fought in rearguard actions while attached to the brigade's infantry units in several [[actions in Nordland]], until all British troops were withdrawn from Bod\u00f8 in the early hours of 1 June.<ref>Wilkinson and Astley (2010), p.66</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe ten Independent Companies were disbanded after the Norwegian campaign. While most of their men were returned to their parent units and formations, calls were being made throughout the Army for men to join the new [[British Commandos|Commando]] units. Those men from the Independent Companies who volunteered were formed on 14 June into No. 11 Independent Company, with an establishment of 25 officers and 350 [[Other ranks (UK)|other ranks]].

As a [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] officer he led two expeditions under authority of President [[Thomas Jefferson]] through the new [[Louisiana Purchase]] territory, first in 1805\u20131806 to reconnoiter the upper northern reaches of the [[Mississippi River]], and then in 1806\u20131807 to explore the Southwest to the fringes of the northern Spanish-colonial settlements of [[New Mexico]] and [[Texas]]. Pike's expeditions coincided with other Jeffersonian expeditions, including the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] (1804\u20131806) and the [[Red River Expedition (1806)|Thomas Freeman and Peter Custis expedition]] up the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] (1806).<ref name=\"Berry\">{{cite book |editor1-first=Trey |editor1-last=Berry |editor2-first=Pam |editor2-last=Beasley |editor3-first=Jeanne |editor3-last=Clements |year=2006 |title=The Forgotten Expedition, 1804\u20131805: The Louisiana Purchase Journals of Dunbar and Hunter |page=xi |publisher=Louisiana State University Press |isbn=978-0-8071-3165-7}}</ref>\n\nPike's second expedition crossed the [[Rocky Mountains]] into what is now southern [[Colorado]], which led to his capture by the Spanish colonial authorities near [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], who sent Pike and his men to [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] (present-day [[Mexico]]), for interrogation. Later in 1807, Pike and some of his men were escorted by the Spanish through Texas and released near American territory in [[Louisiana]].\n\nIn 1810, Pike published an account of his expeditions, a book so popular that it was translated into [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[French language|French]], and [[German language|German]] languages, for publication in [[Europe]]. He later achieved the rank of brigadier general in the American Army and served during the [[War of 1812]], until he was killed during the [[Battle of York]], in April 1813, outside the then [[Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] colonial capital of [[Upper Canada]] (later Toronto, [[Ontario]]).\n\n==Early and family life==\n\n===Early life and education===\nPike was born during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], on January 5, 1779, near Lamberton,<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Washington |last=Irving |title=Biographical Memoir of the Late Brigadier General Zebulon Montgomery Pike |magazine=[[Analectic Magazine]] |volume=4 |date=November 1814 |page=380}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Thomas |last=Wilson |title=The Biography of the Principal American Military and Naval Heroes; Comprehending Details of Their Achievements During the Revolutionary and Late Wars |volume=II |edition=Second |location=New York |publisher=John Low |year=1822 |page=9}}</ref> now called [[Lamington, New Jersey|Lamington]] in [[Bedminster, New Jersey]],<ref>{{cite journal |first=William J. |last=Backes |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XUMVAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA245#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=General Zebulon M.

General [[James Wilkinson]], appointed Governor of the Upper [[Louisiana Territory]] and headquartered there, became his mentor.\n\nIn 1796 Pike shadowed the expedition of General [[Georges Henri Victor Collot]], a French officer who had been tasked to tour the Mississippi frontier, and draw maps that France might use if it were to try and seize this lightly settled territory from the nascent USA.<ref name=Herald-Leader2017-03-19/>\n\n===First Pike Expedition===\nIn the summer of 1805, Wilkinson ordered Pike to locate the source of the [[Mississippi River]], explore the northern portion of the newly created [[Louisiana Territory]], and expel Canadian fur traders illegally trading in the borders of the United States. Pike left St. Louis on August 9, 1805, proceeding upstream by [[pirogue]]. They reached the [[Pike Island|confluence]] of the Mississippi and [[Minnesota River]]s on September 21, where he negotiated a [[Pike's Purchase|treaty]] with the [[Dakota people|Dakota]], purchasing the future site of [[Fort Snelling]]. The expedition proceeded further upriver, stopping to construct a winter camp at the mouth of the Swan River, south of present-day [[Little Falls, Minnesota|Little Falls]], on October 16. On December 10, they continued upstream along the now-frozen river on foot, visiting a number of British [[North West Company]] fur posts along the way.\n\nThey reached the fur post at [[Leech Lake]] on February 1, and stayed nearly three weeks. Pike informed the traders they were within the boundaries of the United States, and henceforth required to abide by its laws and regulations. Pike met with many prominent [[Ojibwe]] chiefs, prevailing on them to surrender the medals and flags given to them as tokens of allegiance by the British, and offering American replacement [[Indian Peace Medal|medals]]. He also relayed the United States' desire that the Ojibwe and Dakota cease their mutual hostility, and invited the chiefs to attend a peace conference in St. Louis (all declined the invitation to travel through several thousand miles of hostile territory). On February 10, they ceremonially shot the [[British ensign|British red ensign]] from the fur company's flag pole, replacing it with an [[Star-Spangled Banner (flag)|American flag]]. On a short side trip (February 12 to 14), Pike traveled to the North West Company fur post on [[Cass Lake (Minnesota)|Upper Red Cedar Lake]] (now commonly known as Cass Lake), erroneously designating the lake as the ultimate source of the Mississippi, and taking celestial observations to determine its [[latitude]].\n\nPike and his men left [[Leech Lake]] on February 18, carrying diplomatic tokens from the Ojibwe chiefs to present to the Dakota chiefs as a gesture of reconciliation, arriving at their winter encampment on March 5. They re-embarked in their pirogues for the downriver journey on April 7, reaching St. Louis on April 20. Pike's was the second expedition dispatched by the government into its new territory, and the first to return.\n\n===Second Pike Expedition===\n{{main|Pike expedition}}\n[[File:Pikes Peak by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pikes Peak]], central Colorado]]\nAfter Pike returned from this first expedition, General Wilkinson almost immediately ordered him to mount a second expedition, this time to explore, map, and find the headwaters of the [[Arkansas River|Arkansas]] and Red rivers. Additional objectives of this exploratory expedition into the southwestern part of the Louisiana Territory were to evaluate natural resources and establish friendly relations with Native Americans.\n\nBeginning July 15, 1806, Pike led what became known as the \"Pike Expedition\". General Wilkinson's son James served as one of his lieutenants, although it now seems that Wilkinson planned that the Spanish who controlled Mexico would capture him and his men.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nIn early November 1806, Pike and his team sighted and tried to climb to the summit of the peak later named after him ([[Pikes Peak]]). They made it as far as Mt. Rosa, located southeast of Pikes Peak, before giving up the ascent in waist-deep snow. They had already gone almost two days without food.\n\nThey then continued south, searching for the Red River's headwaters, and built a fort for shelter during the winter. However, they had crossed the border, whether through confusion or deliberation. [[Spain|Spanish]] authorities captured Pike and some of his party in what was then northern New Mexico (now part of southern [[Colorado]]) on February 26, 1807.\n\nPike and his men were taken to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] then to the capital of [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]] province, and presented to Commandant General Salcedo, who was governor of the state.<ref>{{cite web |last=Buescher |first=John |url=http://teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/24290 |title=Trailing Lewis and Clark |publisher=TeachingHistory.org |accessdate=July 12, 2011}}</ref> Pike was treated well and invited to formal social dinners, but still not quite given the treatment of a visiting dignitary, and his men were kept prisoner. Salcedo housed Pike with Juan Pedro Walker, a cartographer who also acted as an  interpreter. Walker transcribed and translated Pike's confiscated documents, including his journal. Spanish authorities feared the spread of both democracy and Protestant Christian sects that might undermine their rule.\n\nDuring this time, Pike had access to various maps of the southwest and learned about Mexico's discontent with Spanish rule. Spain filed official protests with the United States about Pike's expedition, but since the nations were not at war (and Spain was rebelling against Napoleon's brother, who was fighting England in the [[Peninsular War]]), Commandant Salcedo released the military men. The Spanish escorted Pike and most of his men north, releasing them at the Louisiana border on July 1, 1807. However, some of Pike's soldiers were held for years in Mexico.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n===War of 1812===\nPike was promoted to captain during the southwestern expedition. In 1811, Lt. Col. Zebulon M. Pike with the 4th Infantry Regiment fought at the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]]. He was promoted to colonel of the 15th Infantry Regiment in July 1812. Pike's military career also included service as deputy [[quartermaster]]-general in [[New Orleans]] and [[inspector-general]] during the [[War of 1812]].\n\nPike was promoted to brigadier general in March 1813.<ref name=\"collier\">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Valkenburg |first=Samuel Van |editor=William D.

On this expedition, Pike commanded combat troops in the [[Battle of York|successful attack]] on [[York, Upper Canada|York]] (now [[Toronto]]), on April 27, 1813. Pike was killed, along with numerous other American troops, by flying rocks and other debris when the withdrawing British garrison blew up its ammunition magazine as Pike's troops approached Fort York.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Peppiatt|first1=Liam|title=Chapter 31B: Fort York|url=http://www.landmarksoftoronto.com/fort-york/|website=Robertson's Landmarks of Toronto}}</ref>  His body was brought by ship back to Sackets Harbor, where his remains were buried at the military cemetery.<ref>[https://books.google.ca/books?id=2nN0DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA105&dq=zebulon+pike+sackets+harbor+cemetery&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiYzoS_35bfAhWEJjQIHfZoDgQQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=zebulon%20pike%20sackets%20harbor%20cemetery&f=false ''Graves of Upstate New York'']</ref>\n\n==Journals==\nThe Spanish authorities confiscated Pike's journals, which were not recovered by the United States from Mexico until the 1900s. Pike wrote an account from memory of his expeditions, which was published in 1810 as ''The expeditions of Zebulon Montgomery Pike to Headwaters of the Mississippi River, through Louisiana Territory, and in New Spain, during the Years 1805-6-7''.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=XrMlAAAAMAAJ |title=The expeditions of Zebulon Montgomery Pike to headwaters of the Mississippi River, through Louisiana Territory, and in New Spain, during the years 1805-6-7 |first=Zebulon Montgomery |last=Pike |editor=Elliott Coues |publisher=Ross & Haines |year=1965 |publication-date=1895}}</ref> It was popular; was later translated into [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[French language|French]], and [[German language|German]] editions; and became required reading for all American explorers who followed him in the 19th century.\n\nPike's capture by the Spanish and travel through the Southwest gave Pike insight into the region. For example, he described the politics in Chihuahua, which led to the [[Mexican independence]] movement, and described trade conditions in the Spanish territories of New Mexico and Chihuahua, which contributed to development of the [[Santa Fe Trail]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nIn some eastern regions of North America a tradition or legend pervades often referred to as \"The Lost City of Palanor\" or \"Zebulon's Amulet\" which have been attributed to Pike's journals. The myth, said to be derived from a missing portion of Pike's confiscated journals, is usually told in two segments. The first sequence involves Pike receiving an amulet from a native chieftain as a reward for the rescue of the chief's daughter. The second is a description of Pike's discovery of the lost city \"Palanor,\" said to be built by pre-Columbian European settlers, and his decision to bury the amulet there.\n\n==Legacy==\nAs Olsen (2006) shows, after Pike's death in battle, his military accomplishments were widely celebrated in terms of biographies, mourning memorials, paintings, poems, and songs, and he became the namesake for dozens of towns, counties, and ships. His memory faded after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] but rebounded in 1906, at the centennial of his Southwest Expedition.

As a [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] officer he led two expeditions under authority of President [[Thomas Jefferson]] through the new [[Louisiana Purchase]] territory, first in 1805\u20131806 to reconnoiter the upper northern reaches of the [[Mississippi River]], and then in 1806\u20131807 to explore the Southwest to the fringes of the northern Spanish-colonial settlements of [[New Mexico]] and [[Texas]]. Pike's expeditions coincided with other Jeffersonian expeditions, including the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] (1804\u20131806) and the [[Red River Expedition (1806)|Thomas Freeman and Peter Custis expedition]] up the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] (1806).<ref name=\"Berry\">{{cite book |editor1-first=Trey |editor1-last=Berry |editor2-first=Pam |editor2-last=Beasley |editor3-first=Jeanne |editor3-last=Clements |year=2006 |title=The Forgotten Expedition, 1804\u20131805: The Louisiana Purchase Journals of Dunbar and Hunter |page=xi |publisher=Louisiana State University Press |isbn=978-0-8071-3165-7}}</ref>\n\nPike's second expedition crossed the [[Rocky Mountains]] into what is now southern [[Colorado]], which led to his capture by the Spanish colonial authorities near [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], who sent Pike and his men to [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] (present-day [[Mexico]]), for interrogation. Later in 1807, Pike and some of his men were escorted by the Spanish through Texas and released near American territory in [[Louisiana]].\n\nIn 1810, Pike published an account of his expeditions, a book so popular that it was translated into [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[French language|French]], and [[German language|German]] languages, for publication in [[Europe]]. He later achieved the rank of brigadier general in the American Army and served during the [[War of 1812]], until he was killed during the [[Battle of York]], in April 1813, outside the then [[Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] colonial capital of [[Upper Canada]] (later Toronto, [[Ontario]]).\n\n==Early and family life==\n\n===Early life and education===\nPike was born during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], on January 5, 1779, near Lamberton,<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Washington |last=Irving |title=Biographical Memoir of the Late Brigadier General Zebulon Montgomery Pike |magazine=[[Analectic Magazine]] |volume=4 |date=November 1814 |page=380}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Thomas |last=Wilson |title=The Biography of the Principal American Military and Naval Heroes; Comprehending Details of Their Achievements During the Revolutionary and Late Wars |volume=II |edition=Second |location=New York |publisher=John Low |year=1822 |page=9}}</ref> now called [[Lamington, New Jersey|Lamington]] in [[Bedminster, New Jersey]],<ref>{{cite journal |first=William J. |last=Backes |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XUMVAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA245#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=General Zebulon M.

General [[James Wilkinson]], appointed Governor of the Upper [[Louisiana Territory]] and headquartered there, became his mentor.\n\nIn 1796 Pike shadowed the expedition of General [[Georges Henri Victor Collot]], a French officer who had been tasked to tour the Mississippi frontier, and draw maps that France might use if it were to try and seize this lightly settled territory from the nascent USA.<ref name=Herald-Leader2017-03-19/>\n\n===First Pike Expedition===\nIn the summer of 1805, Wilkinson ordered Pike to locate the source of the [[Mississippi River]], explore the northern portion of the newly created [[Louisiana Territory]], and expel Canadian fur traders illegally trading in the borders of the United States. Pike left St. Louis on August 9, 1805, proceeding upstream by [[pirogue]]. They reached the [[Pike Island|confluence]] of the Mississippi and [[Minnesota River]]s on September 21, where he negotiated a [[Pike's Purchase|treaty]] with the [[Dakota people|Dakota]], purchasing the future site of [[Fort Snelling]]. The expedition proceeded further upriver, stopping to construct a winter camp at the mouth of the Swan River, south of present-day [[Little Falls, Minnesota|Little Falls]], on October 16. On December 10, they continued upstream along the now-frozen river on foot, visiting a number of British [[North West Company]] fur posts along the way.\n\nThey reached the fur post at [[Leech Lake]] on February 1, and stayed nearly three weeks. Pike informed the traders they were within the boundaries of the United States, and henceforth required to abide by its laws and regulations. Pike met with many prominent [[Ojibwe]] chiefs, prevailing on them to surrender the medals and flags given to them as tokens of allegiance by the British, and offering American replacement [[Indian Peace Medal|medals]]. He also relayed the United States' desire that the Ojibwe and Dakota cease their mutual hostility, and invited the chiefs to attend a peace conference in St. Louis (all declined the invitation to travel through several thousand miles of hostile territory). On February 10, they ceremonially shot the [[British ensign|British red ensign]] from the fur company's flag pole, replacing it with an [[Star-Spangled Banner (flag)|American flag]]. On a short side trip (February 12 to 14), Pike traveled to the North West Company fur post on [[Cass Lake (Minnesota)|Upper Red Cedar Lake]] (now commonly known as Cass Lake), erroneously designating the lake as the ultimate source of the Mississippi, and taking celestial observations to determine its [[latitude]].\n\nPike and his men left [[Leech Lake]] on February 18, carrying diplomatic tokens from the Ojibwe chiefs to present to the Dakota chiefs as a gesture of reconciliation, arriving at their winter encampment on March 5. They re-embarked in their pirogues for the downriver journey on April 7, reaching St. Louis on April 20. Pike's was the second expedition dispatched by the government into its new territory, and the first to return.\n\n===Second Pike Expedition===\n{{main|Pike expedition}}\n[[File:Pikes Peak by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pikes Peak]], central Colorado]]\nAfter Pike returned from this first expedition, General Wilkinson almost immediately ordered him to mount a second expedition, this time to explore, map, and find the headwaters of the [[Arkansas River|Arkansas]] and Red rivers. Additional objectives of this exploratory expedition into the southwestern part of the Louisiana Territory were to evaluate natural resources and establish friendly relations with Native Americans.\n\nBeginning July 15, 1806, Pike led what became known as the \"Pike Expedition\". General Wilkinson's son James served as one of his lieutenants, although it now seems that Wilkinson planned that the Spanish who controlled Mexico would capture him and his men.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nIn early November 1806, Pike and his team sighted and tried to climb to the summit of the peak later named after him ([[Pikes Peak]]). They made it as far as Mt. Rosa, located southeast of Pikes Peak, before giving up the ascent in waist-deep snow. They had already gone almost two days without food.\n\nThey then continued south, searching for the Red River's headwaters, and built a fort for shelter during the winter. However, they had crossed the border, whether through confusion or deliberation. [[Spain|Spanish]] authorities captured Pike and some of his party in what was then northern New Mexico (now part of southern [[Colorado]]) on February 26, 1807.\n\nPike and his men were taken to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] then to the capital of [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]] province, and presented to Commandant General Salcedo, who was governor of the state.<ref>{{cite web |last=Buescher |first=John |url=http://teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/24290 |title=Trailing Lewis and Clark |publisher=TeachingHistory.org |accessdate=July 12, 2011}}</ref> Pike was treated well and invited to formal social dinners, but still not quite given the treatment of a visiting dignitary, and his men were kept prisoner. Salcedo housed Pike with Juan Pedro Walker, a cartographer who also acted as an  interpreter. Walker transcribed and translated Pike's confiscated documents, including his journal. Spanish authorities feared the spread of both democracy and Protestant Christian sects that might undermine their rule.\n\nDuring this time, Pike had access to various maps of the southwest and learned about Mexico's discontent with Spanish rule. Spain filed official protests with the United States about Pike's expedition, but since the nations were not at war (and Spain was rebelling against Napoleon's brother, who was fighting England in the [[Peninsular War]]), Commandant Salcedo released the military men. The Spanish escorted Pike and most of his men north, releasing them at the Louisiana border on July 1, 1807. However, some of Pike's soldiers were held for years in Mexico.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n===War of 1812===\nPike was promoted to captain during the southwestern expedition. In 1811, Lt. Col. Zebulon M. Pike with the 4th Infantry Regiment fought at the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]]. He was promoted to colonel of the 15th Infantry Regiment in July 1812. Pike's military career also included service as deputy [[quartermaster]]-general in [[New Orleans]] and [[inspector-general]] during the [[War of 1812]].\n\nPike was promoted to brigadier general in March 1813.<ref name=\"collier\">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Valkenburg |first=Samuel Van |editor=William D.

On this expedition, Pike commanded combat troops in the [[Battle of York|successful attack]] on [[York, Upper Canada|York]] (now [[Toronto]]), on April 27, 1813.

For example, he described the politics in Chihuahua, which led to the [[Mexican independence]] movement, and described trade conditions in the Spanish territories of New Mexico and Chihuahua, which contributed to development of the [[Santa Fe Trail]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n==Legacy==\nAs Olsen (2006) shows, after Pike's death in battle, his military accomplishments were widely celebrated in terms of biographies, mourning memorials, paintings, poems, and songs, and he became the namesake for dozens of towns, counties, and ships. His memory faded after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] but rebounded in 1906, at the centennial of his Southwest Expedition. His 20th-century reputation focused on his exploration, and his name appeared often on natural features, such as dams, islands, lakes, and parks.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Michael L. |last=Olsen |title=Zebulon Pike and American Popular Culture \u2013 or \u2013 Has Pike Peaked? |journal=Kansas History |date=Spring 2006 |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=48\u201359 |url=https://www.kshs.org/publicat/history/2006spring_olsen.pdf}}</ref>\n\nPike was honored in 1901 by [[William Jackson Palmer|General William Jackson Palmer]] with a marble statue placed near the main entrance of the Antlers Hotel.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=William J.

Since then, greed and hatred has taken over humanity and has been deteriorating it for past 6000 years. To end this, a mystical sect of saints known as \"Suryanshis\" chose a man to rise up against all odds and defeat the evil prevailing within society. He was taught the way to energise the 7 chakras of body through Kundalini Yoga that helped him get mystical and supernatural powers. During his training, he also conducted the ritual of death in order to get total control over his powers by entering the holy fire and immersing his physical body in it. When the five natural elements of life, fire, earth, water, wind and sky invigorated his body, he gains superpowers and becomes a [[Superhuman]]. At last, he takes a pledge to finish corruption and injustice in society and fight the evil prevailing in the world. Due to his heroic initial works, he is named Shaktimaan by a reporter, [[Shaktimaan#Geeta Vishwas|Geeta Vishwas]]. Later, it is revealed that\nShaktimaan was the rebirth of Shri Satya who was part of the Suryanshi Sect during the Mahabharata era 5,000 years ago.\n\nHis alter-ego is a funny geek named Pandit Gangadhar Vidyadhar Mayadhar Omkarnath Shastri, who works as a photographer in a daily newspaper office to maintain his secret identity as Shaktimaan and speaks pure [[Hindi]].\n\nShaktimaan's nemesis is Tamraj Kilvish, who is the living embodiment of the evil and dark forces of the world.\n\nShaktimaan is another common human being, but reincarnation of Shri Satya, but has got his internal spiritual powers ignited with the continuous and typical practice of [[Hindu Philosophy|Hindu philosophical]] and cultural values system and activities like [[Yoga|Yog Sadhna]] and [[Meditation]]. Also, he follows the morals and ethical values of truth, non-violence, and values stated in books like the [[Bhagavad Gita]].\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Mukesh Khanna]] as Pandit Gangadhar Vidyadhar Mayadhar Omkarnath Shastri / Shaktimaan, Major Ranjeet Singh (Shaktimaan's Father), Shree Satya (Previous Incarnation of Shaktimaan), Evil Clone Shaktimaan\n* [[Kitu Gidwani]] as Geeta Vishwas (Episode 1-16)\n* [[Vaishnavi Mahant]] as Geeta Vishwas (Episode 16-520)\n* [[Surendra Pal]] as Tamraj Kilvish / Guru Sarvagya\n* [[Tom Alter]] as Mahaguru\n* [[Lalit Parimoo]] as Dr. Jaikaal\n* [[Arun Bakshi]] as Dr. Jaikaal (in last few episodes)\n* Raman Khatri as Sahab / Kumar Ranjan\n* Sharad Smart as Satyaprakash Nirala, the 1st editor of ''Aaj Ki Awaaz''\n* [[Raju Shrivastav]] as Durandhar Singh, the 2nd editor of ''Aaj Ki Awaaz''\n* [[Manjeet Kullar]] as Kaushalya / Maharani Shavalika, Shaktimaan's biological mother\n* [[Ashwini Kalsekar]] as Shalaaka / Kaali Billi\n* [[Dolly Minhas]] as Shaliyaa / Safed Billi, elder sister and guardian of Shalaaka\n* [[Kishore Bhanushali]] as Naurangee the thief\n* [[Rajendra Gupta]] as Prof. Vishwas, paranormal scientist, Geeta Vishwas's father.\n* Jay Mishra as Ghosh Babu\n* [[Nawab Shah (actor)|Nawab Shah]] as Mayor JJ \"Jai Kumar Janardhan\" / Kakodar\n* [[Deepshikha Nagpal]] as Paroma and Sheraali (dual roles)\n* Sunila Karambelkar as Queen Mayaadri and Natasha in starting episodes\n* Brij Mohan Pandey as Bankelal / Toyman\n* Sanjeev Chaddha as Shudhanshu ji\n* Ajit Mehra as Shwami Ji\n* [[Arun Bali]] as Dayal Chopra, Businessman and owner of Aaj Ki Awaz\n* [[Zahida Parveen]] as Nisha Saluja, reporter who replaced Geeta at Aaj Ki Awaz\n* Hemal Dharia as Hemal\n* Sharad Smart as Satya Prakash Nirala\n* Urmila Amar as Leela Lautekar\n*[[Nupur Alankar]] as Kaamini, Film gossip writer at ''Aaj Ki Awaaz''\n* [[Shikha Swaroop]] as Alien (special appearance)\n* [[Goga Kapoor]] as Bilas Rao\n* Zeena Bhatia as Matandeeka Witch\n* [[Deepraj Rana]] as Inspector Jai Singh, a Corrupt Police officer.\n* [[Urvashi Dholakia]] as Maansi Sharma\n* Annu Kashyap as Teemira / Behroopia\n* [[Neelam Mehra]] as Maansi\n* Shravani Goswami as Shalini (Bengali Bahu)\n* Durgesh Nandini as Rachna (Punjabi Bahu)\n* Manav Sohal as Shalini's husband\n\n== Production ==\n''Shaktimaan'' was conceptualised by Khanna in 1981, when he was working on a film with [[Rajshri Productions]]. He narrated the idea to producer Rajkumar Barjatya, who liked it, and the two adapted it into a film titled ''Akash''. In November 1997, ''[[Screen (magazine)|Screen]]'' reported quoted him: \"I would watch my nephew sitting glued to the TV whenever ''Power Zone'' came on, shooting with imaginary [[laser guns]], or operating some imaginary hi-fi gadget in his own little world. That's when it struck me that if I made ''Shaktimaan'' I would have a readymade audience of kids who are always most impressed with [[Special effects|SFX]] tricks.\" Over the development of the titular character, Khanna said, \"In Indian mythology there are a lot of strong characters but no super-heroes. All we get to see are [[Superman]] or [[Spider-Man|Spiderman]], who are alien concepts. That's why I decided to create an Indian super-hero, Shaktimaan, who is born out of a [[yagna]], and a result of all the creative energies of the universe. A superhero who can fly...disappear. And when he is not in his super-hero [[Dual role|avataar]] he's a bumbling photographer who always misses scoop much to the chagrin of his boss Kitu Gidwani.\" He added that the attire of Shaktimaan's alter ego, \"complete with buck teeth and floppy hair\" was inspired by American comedian [[Jerry Lewis]].<ref name=\"screen\">{{cite web |title=Mukesh Khanna: No More Mthologicals |url=http://www.screenindia.com/nov14/tele1.htm |website=Screen |accessdate=14 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031031211440/http://www.screenindia.com/nov14/tele1.htm |archivedate=31 October 2003 |date=November 1997}}</ref>\n\nHaving wanted the \"best ever\" special effects seen on Indian television, following the series' airing, Khanna felt that it \"[fell] short of [his] expectations\".

They are followers of the star ''Sun''. As part of training, he trained with [[Kundalini Yoga]] to awake the 7 chakras of body and gain 'supernatural' powers from them. To gain complete control over his powers he performed the ritual of death. However, this did not cause death but made him more alive than when he was a normal man. He also performed [[Yajna]] in which he entered the fire himself and dissolved his body in fire. Then, the five elements of life, i.e. fire, wind, water, earth, sky revived his body giving him special powers from them. Thus after leaving his mortal body he was given a superhuman form to fight against the evil in the world as Shaktimaan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgrZ2ofIcT8|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 1|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter Shaktimaan was created he set out to destroy his archenemy Kilvish. But, as the Mahaguru ([[Tom Alter]]) explained, Kilvish can only be defeated after evil is destroyed. Shaktimaan's mission is to destroy the sin within people, not the sinned people. Shaktimaan's adventures show him pursuing justice and saving his friends while Kilvish and his minions plot to defeat him.\n\n=== Powers ===\nShaktimaan has superhuman powers which lie inside his body in his seven chakras of [[Kundalini energy|Kundalini]] attained through meditation. Shaktimaan worships God through the symbol [[Om]]. Truthfulness is his motto. He can even separate his body into five different bodies of fire, wind, water, earth and sky.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuTDNEmCzB8|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 43|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref> He is an expert, skilled and intelligent fighter and has fought with super-skilled enemies. He possesses physical powers like unlimited speed (up to the speed of light), strength, durability as well as psychic powers like telepathy, teleportation, telekinesis etc.\nAlthough he possesses godlike powers, his only weakness is a crystal (Papmani) possessed by Tamraj Kilvish which can be used to defeat and even kill him. This makes him powerless because it is filled with the evil of the world and is the source of the black powers. But he regains his strength after the crystal is taken away from him. He can be killed if the crystal is placed in front of him and he is treated violently to the verge of death. Shaktimaan also gets brief premonitions about the incidents that are going to happen to him in future. This can be observed in kashtak's episode, Geeta going to jail and in kapala's reappearance episodes.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cuwX6vm8dqw | title = Shaktimaan episode 172}}</ref>\n\nShaktimaan's powers are virtually limitless. He can do practically anything he imagines. The only limit to his powers is his own belief in himself and his knowledge of how to manifest his powers. His powers come from his chakras. (Note: Although we'll call them chakras in the vedas, in the series dialogue they will also be called energy centers.)\n\nThe seven chakras in his body which give him powers are:\n* Energy Chakra (1): This chakra gives Shaktimaan super strength enabling him to fly, shoot fire from his hands, emit rays from his fingertips, blow a stream of freezing air, or send out protective force fields which nothing can penetrate (provided he can maintain his willpower and not give in). Shaktimaan's strength allows him to physically penetrate anything and lift any object.\n* Creative Chakra (2): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power to manifest things out of thin air.\n* Astral Chakra (3): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power to control his astral body (a semi-transparent, ethereal duplicate of himself) which can fly, walk through walls, see inside objects, etc.\n* Heart Chakra (4): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power to control the will of others, but only for good. He can will people to do the right thing, see the error in their ways. This power is most useful when Shaktimaan needs to stop someone who is under the control of Kilvish from doing evil.\n* Vibration Chakra (5): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power to control all types of vibrations, including sound waves, light waves, healing warmth, etc. He can also use it to hear ultrasonic sounds, and can speed up the vibrations of his own atoms allowing him to transport himself in space or time. This can be very useful for getting out of dangerous situations.\n* Psychic Chakra (6): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power of the \"third eye\" which enables him to read minds and see anywhere in the world at any distance. He can sense impending danger and see things at any corner of the world.\n\nThe source of power of Shaktimaan is Kundalini,\n\nThere are seven chakras in the Kundalini\n\n* 1. Muladhar Chakra *\n\nThis gives control over the Earth element.\n\nPhysical force like gravitation, gravitational force etc.\n\n*2. Swadhishthan *\n\nWater element control\n\nJalajgraman, living in water, fearlessness etc.\n\n* 3 Manipura Chakra *\n\nFire control\n\nComplete knowledge of yoga, without living water, food or living of air, travel by sky, journey of invisibility, velocity equal to light, knowledge of all languages, knowledge of languages of birds and tree plants\n\nNature control such as climate climatic earthquake, leadership capacity, hypnotism, meditation, removal of all types of rays such as xray vision, medicine as well as knowledge of Ayurveda\n\n* 4. [[Anahata (Heart Chakra)|Anahata Chakra]] *\n\nAir control\n\nNirvikalpa Samadhi, Proximity to Brahma, Trikalagalyta, Doordarshan, Kalnagna, Time Control, such as Time Travel\n\nTelepathy, foreign entry (entering the living or dead body of another)\n\nKnowledge of the action of cosmic intersection, going into different planets, stars, realms, and multiverse, entering 26 dimensions, watching the above-mentioned places from a distance\n\nTo see the invisible, the philosophy of Goddesses, rejuvenation, attracting all, the pace of mind, the meditation and manifestation,\n\nHypnotism\n\n* 5 vishuddh chakra *\n\nSky control\n\nThe establishment of Saraswati, which has knowledge of ancient and modern science\n\nThe ability to betray, curse and boast\nKnowledge of entire texts\nLiterature composition, stream flow discourse,\nSong music and dance art\nTo hold many bodies like yours or different\n\nOn the other hand, Hanuman ji swallowed the sun upon the desire to make the body bigger by the desire.\n\nKnowing the subtle mysteries of the universe,\n\nRevealing any substance from zero, turning one thing into another,\n\nChange of form, philosophy of brahman\n\nEuthanasia (immortality), hypnosis and hipnotism\n\n* 6. Agya chakra *\n\nControl over the whole universe\n\nDevour someone\n\nAwakening of ternate\n\nTo give someone infinite powers, to make their own, to make the unsuccessful success, to remove all types of rays, such as power rays, xray vision, becoming like God, attaining Brahmana\n\n* 7. Sahasrara Chakra *\n\nControl over entire universes (multiverses)\n\nAbility to compose, follow, and destroy the universe\n\nTo be equal to Parabrahma, infinite power, nature is adorned for obedience\n\n=== Personal life ===\nTo avoid being an easy prey of Tamraj Kilvish, Shaktimaan adopted a different identity as\nPandit Gangadhar Vidyadhar Mayadhar Omkarnath Shastri in the society. The character Gangadhar is completely opposite to that of Shaktimaan in all aspects e.g. appearance, intelligence while he speaks pure [[Hindi language|Hindi]]. Whenever he gets any important job to do, he says that he has written a book on it which had never been published. Staying in the society as a common person helped him to get knowledge about crime. He got a job of a photographer for the newspaper ''Aaj Ki Awaaz'' after being interviewed by [[Shaktimaan#Geeta Vishwas|Geeta Vishwas]]. After a few weeks, he became a co-reporter working with Geeta. Through a series of incidents and the fact that he could never capture a photo of Shaktimaan, Geeta came to know about the dual identity of Shaktimaan, which was previously known only to Suryanshis. After ''Aaj Ki Awaaz'' was shut down, Gangadhar became a Hindi professor at a junior college. Later, he left the college to work for a news channel ''KR TV'' with Geeta.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n=== Main characters ===\n\n==== Geeta Vishwas ====\nGeeta Vishwas ([[Vaishnavi Mahant]], previously [[Kitu Gidwani]]), the female lead in the serial, used to work as a brave news reporter in ''Aaj Ki Awaaz''. She was the first to report about Shaktimaan in newspaper and named the superhero as ''Shaktimaan''. Incidentally, she was the only reporter to get interviews of Shaktimaan as Gangadhar used to accompany her as photographer in missions. She died in a crash planned by Dr. Jackal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0r8M4plt9c|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 101|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref> As Shaktimaan loved her, he brought her back to life again using his power which resulted in losing his powers temporarily due to his ''against the nature actions''. Geeta came to know about this after Shaktimaan regained power with the vow that he will never repeat the same mistake again. To ensure this, she planned to leave the country. In the lead up to that situation, she got to know about Shaktimaan's dual character for the third time. But unlike first two occasions, Shaktimaan didn't erase it from Geeta's memory this time as she promised to keep it secret forever.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9y8GUm3-UbA|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 109|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nOne year later<sup>\u2021</sup>, after ''Aaj Ki Awaaz'' was shut down, its staff members persuaded Geeta in returning to India to join them to release Shaktimaan comics. Later she teamed up with Gangadhar again and joined ''KR TV''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtPBVkdn6Yc&list|title=shaktimaan 22 12 2010 0002|publisher=YouTube.com |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref> as a television reporter while working for the comics simultaneously.\n\n<sup>\u2021</sup>&nbsp;\u2013 ''When the journalist character Geeta Vishwas was written out of the series, fan protests prompted the producers to bring her back.''<ref name=interview>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiantelevision.com/interviews/actor/vaishnavi.htm |title=An Interview with vaishnavi Mahant |publisher=Indiantelevision.com |date=12 October 2001 |accessdate=7 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Enemies ===\n\n==== Main enemies ====\n; Jackal and Kilvish\nTamraj Kilvish is Shaktimaan's archenemy. Tamraj means King of Darkness (''tama'' = darkness, ''raj'' = king). He has lived 6000 years and is the source of evil in the world. He intends to rule the world by spreading darkness, hatred, sin and evil. It is said that the source of his strength is one-half of the \"Shakti Punj\" (the half which is referred to as \"shaktiman\") which he managed to retain after he originally obtained the entire Shakti Punj by deceit from Shri Satya (Satya means truth), the founder of the Suryavanshi. However, it is also mentioned that the source of his strength is the evil that is committed by people in this world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LB9JLeGRUIk|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 70|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nIt was later revealed that only Shri Satya can kill Tamraj Kilvish. After a death-defying adventure, Shaktimaan was told that he is the rebirth of Shri Satya. Shri Satya had given the exact time of the child's birth and the place before he died about 6000 years ago. Tamraj also knows this and this is the main reason he is frightened by the appearance of Shaktimaan as he knows that only Shaktimaan can kill Tamraj. He murdered Shaktimaan's parents and his adoptive father, Pandit Vidyadhar Shastri.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/s/shakti.htm |title=International Hero&nbsp;\u2013 Shaktimaan |accessdate=25 November 2011}}</ref> He and his minions plot to kill him but always fail. His minions include Electric-man (who can shoot lightning bolts from his body), Stone-man (who can shoot stones from his body), Plastica (who can stretch any part of her body), Dr. Jackal (an evil scientist) and others. Dr. Jackal has helped Kilvish in his various schemes by cloning Shaktimaan and also by turning aliens against him.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=189133 |newspaper=Indian Express |title=Bad Boys |date=21 June 2006 |author=Tushar Abhichandani |accessdate=23 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060919194526/http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=189133 |archivedate=19 September 2006  }}</ref>\n\nIn the television series, Kilvish is often treated as the personification of darkness itself even though he was once a human being who later becomes very powerful and commits many evil deeds. In an attempt to become immortal, he left his mortal body and took an ethereal body which can't be killed but Shaktimaan is told that he has to kill all the evil in the world to destroy Tamraj's ethereal body. Kilvish's trademark quote is \"Andhera Kaayam Rahe\" (May Darkness Prevail), which is also used by his followers.\n\nKilvish's character evolves as the series progresses. In the beginning episodes of Shaktimaan, his face is never shown and his voice is different from the voice that he uses in the later episodes of Shaktimaan, in which his role is played by [[Surendra Pal]]. Later his face deforms to become a distorted wolf-like face.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bakwaasbybiswas.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/kilwis.jpg|title=Bakwaas by Biswas (WordPress blog)|accessdate= 13 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n; Dr. Jackal\nDr. Jackal is an evil scientist who works for Kilvish. His earlier intention was not that of becoming evil, but when he was denied scholarship for research, Kilvish provided him with funds and labs, thus making him a supporter of Kilvish & an evil scientist.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iof2Ce4egp8|title=Shaktimaan Episode&nbsp;\u2013 224|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\nThough he is overall a brilliant scientist, his specialisation is cloning and various energy rays.\nHis creations against Shaktimaan include Kekda Man (a clone formed by fusing cells of Crab & human), followed by Jonk Jonkaa (a clone using leech), an evil clone of Shaktimaan, Plastica,\nLightman, 3D image, Super-heroine Sunanda and others. He also invented a height control solution and fictional EC- rays.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l14zW_E1VzI|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 120|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83uDEE69YlY|title=Shaktimaan Episode&nbsp;\u2013 28|publisher=YouTube.com 3 |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buecO_bwsls|title=Shaktimaan Episode&nbsp;\u2013 301|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-lG6uoeh7E|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 162|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVVTrBXe18s|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 38|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJf6yZZdkes|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 41 |publisher=YouTube.com |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDNhyZ5abCE|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 42 |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n; Sahab\nSahab is an organised criminal and drug lord. Like Shaktimaan he also possesses double identity, the other being that of a law-abiding industrialist and Mayor, known as Kumar Ranjan. Except for Tamraj Kilvish (and later Dr. Jackal), no one knows that Sahab and Kumar Ranjan are the same person, thus making this his biggest strength. Through his criminal mind, Sahab keeps plotting ways to create trouble for Shaktimaan or to defame him and to find out about the real identity of Shaktimaan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsseb6UtzyA&list|title=shaktimaan 10 1 2011 0002|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n==== Other enemies ====\n; Kakodar\nKakodar is a sorcerer with the visage of a devil who was imprisoned in a statue nearly five hundred years ago. He could only be freed if a good person removes a thread from his neck. It is unclear whether he was cursed by an enemy or punished by Tamraj to end up imprisoned. In the present day, the mayor of Mumbai, Jai Kumar Janardhan a.k.a. JJ (Nawab Shah) was deceived by his personal assistant Mathur (Deepak Bhatia) to break the thread and free him. Mayor JJ died in shock at seeing Kakodar's true form. As instructed by Madhur, Kakodar possessed JJ's body and decided to spread ''Andhera'' (darkness).\n\nHe was the primary super villain in the first part of the series as he uses JJ's wealth and power to hatch plots to kill Shaktimaan but always failed. Unlike most of other assailants of Shaktimaan, he is very sharp and analytical. He even tries to approach Tarendra, an all knowing sentient being of light, to know the truth about Shaktimaan. He is cunning enough to be able to use mental manipulation to trick Shaktimaan on occasion. This put the hero into a dilemma, and self-doubt drained him of his powers temporarily.\n\nThe full extent of his powers is not revealed. On an occasion, JJ's girlfriend Zuby realises that JJ is possessed by a demon and tries to reveal him in public. He uses hypnosis to drive her mad so that the public will ignore her statements. He has a potent and fatal poison inside him that he can spit out of his mouth which affects everyone except Shaktimaan. Shaktimaan and Kakodar end things in a fight when Kakodar turns into his real form and Shaktimaan turns him back to a statue.\n\n; Natasha\nNatasha (Sunila) was also a demonic evil woman sent by Kilvish. Along with Mathur she serves JJ/Kakodar. She was JJ's secretary before he was possessed. She has the ability to change her appearance. She kills a C.B.I. officer and takes her appearance to interrogate Gangadhar and Geeta on one occasion. Her powers were greatly diminished due to Shaktimaan defeating Kakodar. To regain power she and Madhur decide to sacrifice Shaktimaan. For this they kidnap the son of a scientist to get the formula of ''invisible man'' which may help defeating Shaktimaan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dHANSmJg6A|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 24 |publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n; Madhur\nMadhur (Deepak Bhatia) is one of the two trusted demonic accomplices of JJ/Kakodar along with Natasha. He initially served JJ as his personal assistant (PA) before he was possessed, but was secretly preparing the stage for Kakodar's entry under Tamraj's directions. His true identity is revealed after Kakodar is released from his imprisonment. Not many of his powers are revealed in the series. He has the ability to change his appearance at will, but not shape shift to assume someone else's body. He also loses his powers when Kakodar was defeated by Shaktimaan.\n\n; Electric-man\nHe was the first synthetic villain faced by Shaktimaan. Dr. Chandola, an evil scientist, created him. Dr. Chandola claims that Electric man was his son, whom he killed so that he can resurrect the dead body with electricity. When he comes to life he kills Dr. Chandola. Without recognising friend from foe he kills everyone in his path and spreads destruction in the city. His powers include shooting electricity from eyes and electrocution on contact. Finding him difficult to restrain, Shaktimaan grabs him and tunnels deep into the earth, pushing him deep underground.\n\n; Kapala\nKapala is a corrupted tantrik who serves Tamraj Kilvish. His primary skill is his shape shifting to inanimate objects such as vehicles and weapons. He also has many other magical devices and servants under his control. One such device is metal plate he wears around his neck that has the power to steal his opponent's strength. The villain Stone man was created from his magic skull. Shaktimaan destroys both the metal plate and the magic skull. He has an odd sense of humor as he makes jokes while fighting Shaktimaan. There are occasions where he serves as a comic relief.

Since then, greed and hatred has taken over humanity and has been deteriorating it for past 6000 years. To end this, a mystical sect of saints known as \"Suryanshis\" chose a man to rise up against all odds and defeat the evil prevailing within society. He was taught the way to energise the 7 chakras of body through Kundalini Yoga that helped him get mystical and supernatural powers. During his training, he also conducted the ritual of death in order to get total control over his powers by entering the holy fire and immersing his physical body in it. When the five natural elements of life, fire, earth, water, wind and sky invigorated his body, he gains superpowers and becomes a [[Superhuman]]. At last, he takes a pledge to finish corruption and injustice in society and fight the evil prevailing in the world. Due to his heroic initial works, he is named Shaktimaan by a reporter, [[Shaktimaan#Geeta Vishwas|Geeta Vishwas]]. Later, it is revealed that\nShaktimaan was the rebirth of Shri Satya who was part of the Suryanshi Sect during the Mahabharata era 5,000 years ago.\n\nHis alter-ego is a funny geek named Pandit Gangadhar Vidyadhar Mayadhar Omkarnath Shastri, who works as a photographer in a daily newspaper office to maintain his secret identity as Shaktimaan and speaks pure [[Hindi]].\n\nShaktimaan's nemesis is Tamraj Kilvish, who is the living embodiment of the evil and dark forces of the world.\n\nShaktimaan is another common human being, but reincarnation of Shri Satya, but has got his internal spiritual powers ignited with the continuous and typical practice of [[Hindu Philosophy|Hindu philosophical]] and cultural values system and activities like [[Yoga|Yog Sadhna]] and [[Meditation]]. Also, he follows the morals and ethical values of truth, non-violence, and values stated in books like the [[Bhagavad Gita]].\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Mukesh Khanna]] as Pandit Gangadhar Vidyadhar Mayadhar Omkarnath Shastri / Shaktimaan, Major Ranjeet Singh (Shaktimaan's Father), Shree Satya (Previous Incarnation of Shaktimaan), Evil Clone Shaktimaan\n* [[Kitu Gidwani]] as Geeta Vishwas (Episode 1-16)\n* [[Vaishnavi Mahant]] as Geeta Vishwas (Episode 16-520)\n* [[Surendra Pal]] as Tamraj Kilvish / Guru Sarvagya\n* [[Tom Alter]] as Mahaguru\n* [[Lalit Parimoo]] as Dr. Jaikaal\n* [[Arun Bakshi]] as Dr. Jaikaal (in last few episodes)\n* Raman Khatri as Sahab / Kumar Ranjan\n* Sharad Smart as Satyaprakash Nirala, the 1st editor of ''Aaj Ki Awaaz''\n* [[Raju Shrivastav]] as Durandhar Singh, the 2nd editor of ''Aaj Ki Awaaz''\n* [[Manjeet Kullar]] as Kaushalya / Maharani Shavalika, Shaktimaan's biological mother\n* [[Ashwini Kalsekar]] as Shalaaka / Kaali Billi\n* [[Dolly Minhas]] as Shaliyaa / Safed Billi, elder sister and guardian of Shalaaka\n* [[Kishore Bhanushali]] as Naurangee the thief\n* [[Rajendra Gupta]] as Prof. Vishwas, paranormal scientist, Geeta Vishwas's father.\n* Jay Mishra as Ghosh Babu\n* [[Nawab Shah (actor)|Nawab Shah]] as Mayor JJ \"Jai Kumar Janardhan\" / Kakodar\n* [[Deepshikha Nagpal]] as Paroma and Sheraali (dual roles)\n* Sunila Karambelkar as Queen Mayaadri and Natasha in starting episodes\n* Brij Mohan Pandey as Bankelal / Toyman\n* Sanjeev Chaddha as Shudhanshu ji\n* Ajit Mehra as Shwami Ji\n* [[Arun Bali]] as Dayal Chopra, Businessman and owner of Aaj Ki Awaz\n* [[Zahida Parveen]] as Nisha Saluja, reporter who replaced Geeta at Aaj Ki Awaz\n* Hemal Dharia as Hemal\n* Sharad Smart as Satya Prakash Nirala\n* Urmila Amar as Leela Lautekar\n*[[Nupur Alankar]] as Kaamini, Film gossip writer at ''Aaj Ki Awaaz''\n* [[Shikha Swaroop]] as Alien (special appearance)\n* [[Goga Kapoor]] as Bilas Rao\n* Zeena Bhatia as Matandeeka Witch\n* [[Deepraj Rana]] as Inspector Jai Singh, a Corrupt Police officer.\n* [[Urvashi Dholakia]] as Maansi Sharma\n* Annu Kashyap as Teemira / Behroopia\n* [[Neelam Mehra]] as Maansi\n* Shravani Goswami as Shalini (Bengali Bahu)\n* Durgesh Nandini as Rachna (Punjabi Bahu)\n* Manav Sohal as Shalini's husband\n\n== Production ==\n''Shaktimaan'' was conceptualised by Khanna in 1981, when he was working on a film with [[Rajshri Productions]]. He narrated the idea to producer Rajkumar Barjatya, who liked it, and the two adapted it into a film titled ''Akash''. In November 1997, ''[[Screen (magazine)|Screen]]'' reported quoted him: \"I would watch my nephew sitting glued to the TV whenever ''Power Zone'' came on, shooting with imaginary [[laser guns]], or operating some imaginary hi-fi gadget in his own little world. That's when it struck me that if I made ''Shaktimaan'' I would have a readymade audience of kids who are always most impressed with [[Special effects|SFX]] tricks.\" Over the development of the titular character, Khanna said, \"In Indian mythology there are a lot of strong characters but no super-heroes. All we get to see are [[Superman]] or [[Spider-Man|Spiderman]], who are alien concepts. That's why I decided to create an Indian super-hero, Shaktimaan, who is born out of a [[yagna]], and a result of all the creative energies of the universe. A superhero who can fly...disappear. And when he is not in his super-hero [[Dual role|avataar]] he's a bumbling photographer who always misses scoop much to the chagrin of his boss Kitu Gidwani.\" He added that the attire of Shaktimaan's alter ego, \"complete with buck teeth and floppy hair\" was inspired by American comedian [[Jerry Lewis]].<ref name=\"screen\">{{cite web |title=Mukesh Khanna: No More Mthologicals |url=http://www.screenindia.com/nov14/tele1.htm |website=Screen |accessdate=14 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031031211440/http://www.screenindia.com/nov14/tele1.htm |archivedate=31 October 2003 |date=November 1997}}</ref>\n\nHaving wanted the \"best ever\" special effects seen on Indian television, following the series' airing, Khanna felt that it \"[fell] short of [his] expectations\". He added, \"When I had planned the serial I wanted the kind of special effects seen in ''Superman'', ''Spiderman'' and ''[[Terminator (franchise)|Terminator]]''. Maybe I was too ambitious. [[Computer graphics]] has just arrived in India and there is lack of trained professionals here.\" He further said, the special effects for each episode costed him {{INR}}2 [[lakh]], and {{INR}}10 lakh overall.<ref name=\"screen\"/>\nIn 2004 Sign language interpretation was launched for the social message given in the end of the episodes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20040201/spectrum/tv.htm|title=The Sunday Tribune - Spectrum - Television|website=www.tribuneindia.com}}</ref>\n\nThe series was sponsored by [[Parle-G]] from its first episode.<ref name=\"screen\"/>\n\nIn 2019, Mukesh Khanna revealed through his YouTube channel that the show had to be cancelled because the high broadcasting charges were bringing him losses, and not due to complaints of children imitating stunts from the show as popularly believed.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.amarujala.com/photo-gallery/entertainment/bollywood/mukesh-khanna-on-shaktimaan-why-this-show-off-air|title=14 \u0938\u093e\u0932 \u092c\u093e\u0926 \u092e\u0941\u0915\u0947\u0936 \u0916\u0928\u094d\u0928\u093e \u0928\u0947 \u092c\u092f\u093e\u0902 \u0915\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0926\u0930\u094d\u0926, \u0907\u0938 \u0935\u091c\u0939 \u0938\u0947 \u092c\u0902\u0926 \u0915\u0930\u0928\u093e \u092a\u0921\u093c\u093e \u0925\u093e '\u0936\u0915\u094d\u0924\u093f\u092e\u093e\u0928'|newspaper=[[Amar Ujala]]}}</ref>\n\n\n==Broadcast==\nThe series ran for 450 episodes from 13 September 1997 to 27 March 2005 on [[DD National]].<ref name=\"date\"/> Reruns of the series also aired on   [[STAR Utsav]] and [[Dangal TV]].<ref name=\"archive.org12\">{{cite web|url=http://app.indya.com:80/epg/asp/displaySchedules.asp?ddChannelName=starutsav|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090516180410/http://app.indya.com:80/epg/asp/displaySchedules.asp?ddChannelName=starutsav|archivedate=2009-05-16|title=STAR - Programme Guide|date=16 May 2009}}</ref> \n\nRe-edited version of the series premiered on [[Pogo TV]] in 2006, The series was also dubbed in English language for the network.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/west-bengal/screen-on-off/cid/1275205|title=Screen On & Off|website=www.telegraphindia.com}}</ref><ref name=\"archive.org18\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pogo.tv/tvschedule|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218185837/http://www.pogo.tv/tvschedule|archivedate=2015-02-18|title=TV Schedule - POGO!

They are followers of the star ''Sun''. As part of training, he trained with [[Kundalini Yoga]] to awake the 7 chakras of body and gain 'supernatural' powers from them. To gain complete control over his powers he performed the ritual of death. However, this did not cause death but made him more alive than when he was a normal man. He also performed [[Yajna]] in which he entered the fire himself and dissolved his body in fire. Then, the five elements of life, i.e. fire, wind, water, earth, sky revived his body giving him special powers from them. Thus after leaving his mortal body he was given a superhuman form to fight against the evil in the world as Shaktimaan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgrZ2ofIcT8|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 1|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter Shaktimaan was created he set out to destroy his archenemy Kilvish. But, as the Mahaguru ([[Tom Alter]]) explained, Kilvish can only be defeated after evil is destroyed. Shaktimaan's mission is to destroy the sin within people, not the sinned people. Shaktimaan's adventures show him pursuing justice and saving his friends while Kilvish and his minions plot to defeat him.\n\n=== Powers ===\nShaktimaan has superhuman powers which lie inside his body in his seven chakras of [[Kundalini energy|Kundalini]] attained through meditation. Shaktimaan worships God through the symbol [[Om]]. Truthfulness is his motto. He can even separate his body into five different bodies of fire, wind, water, earth and sky.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuTDNEmCzB8|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 43|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref> He is an expert, skilled and intelligent fighter and has fought with super-skilled enemies. He possesses physical powers like unlimited speed (up to the speed of light), strength, durability as well as psychic powers like telepathy, teleportation, telekinesis etc.\nAlthough he possesses godlike powers, his only weakness is a crystal (Papmani) possessed by Tamraj Kilvish which can be used to defeat and even kill him. This makes him powerless because it is filled with the evil of the world and is the source of the black powers. But he regains his strength after the crystal is taken away from him. He can be killed if the crystal is placed in front of him and he is treated violently to the verge of death. Shaktimaan also gets brief premonitions about the incidents that are going to happen to him in future. This can be observed in kashtak's episode, Geeta going to jail and in kapala's reappearance episodes.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cuwX6vm8dqw | title = Shaktimaan episode 172}}</ref>\n\nShaktimaan's powers are virtually limitless. He can do practically anything he imagines. The only limit to his powers is his own belief in himself and his knowledge of how to manifest his powers. His powers come from his chakras. (Note: Although we'll call them chakras in the vedas, in the series dialogue they will also be called energy centers.)\n\nThe seven chakras in his body which give him powers are:\n* Energy Chakra (1): This chakra gives Shaktimaan super strength enabling him to fly, shoot fire from his hands, emit rays from his fingertips, blow a stream of freezing air, or send out protective force fields which nothing can penetrate (provided he can maintain his willpower and not give in). Shaktimaan's strength allows him to physically penetrate anything and lift any object.\n* Creative Chakra (2): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power to manifest things out of thin air.\n* Astral Chakra (3): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power to control his astral body (a semi-transparent, ethereal duplicate of himself) which can fly, walk through walls, see inside objects, etc.\n* Heart Chakra (4): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power to control the will of others, but only for good. He can will people to do the right thing, see the error in their ways. This power is most useful when Shaktimaan needs to stop someone who is under the control of Kilvish from doing evil.\n* Vibration Chakra (5): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power to control all types of vibrations, including sound waves, light waves, healing warmth, etc. He can also use it to hear ultrasonic sounds, and can speed up the vibrations of his own atoms allowing him to transport himself in space or time. This can be very useful for getting out of dangerous situations.\n* Psychic Chakra (6): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power of the \"third eye\" which enables him to read minds and see anywhere in the world at any distance. He can sense impending danger and see things at any corner of the world.\n\nThe source of power of Shaktimaan is Kundalini,\n\nThere are seven chakras in the Kundalini\n\n* 1.

The character Gangadhar is completely opposite to that of Shaktimaan in all aspects e.g. appearance, intelligence while he speaks pure [[Hindi language|Hindi]]. Whenever he gets any important job to do, he says that he has written a book on it which had never been published. Staying in the society as a common person helped him to get knowledge about crime. He got a job of a photographer for the newspaper ''Aaj Ki Awaaz'' after being interviewed by [[Shaktimaan#Geeta Vishwas|Geeta Vishwas]]. After a few weeks, he became a co-reporter working with Geeta. Through a series of incidents and the fact that he could never capture a photo of Shaktimaan, Geeta came to know about the dual identity of Shaktimaan, which was previously known only to Suryanshis. After ''Aaj Ki Awaaz'' was shut down, Gangadhar became a Hindi professor at a junior college. Later, he left the college to work for a news channel ''KR TV'' with Geeta.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n=== Main characters ===\n\n==== Geeta Vishwas ====\nGeeta Vishwas ([[Vaishnavi Mahant]], previously [[Kitu Gidwani]]), the female lead in the serial, used to work as a brave news reporter in ''Aaj Ki Awaaz''. She was the first to report about Shaktimaan in newspaper and named the superhero as ''Shaktimaan''. Incidentally, she was the only reporter to get interviews of Shaktimaan as Gangadhar used to accompany her as photographer in missions. She died in a crash planned by Dr. Jackal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0r8M4plt9c|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 101|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref> As Shaktimaan loved her, he brought her back to life again using his power which resulted in losing his powers temporarily due to his ''against the nature actions''. Geeta came to know about this after Shaktimaan regained power with the vow that he will never repeat the same mistake again. To ensure this, she planned to leave the country. In the lead up to that situation, she got to know about Shaktimaan's dual character for the third time. But unlike first two occasions, Shaktimaan didn't erase it from Geeta's memory this time as she promised to keep it secret forever.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9y8GUm3-UbA|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 109|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nOne year later<sup>\u2021</sup>, after ''Aaj Ki Awaaz'' was shut down, its staff members persuaded Geeta in returning to India to join them to release Shaktimaan comics.

Tamraj means King of Darkness (''tama'' = darkness, ''raj'' = king). He has lived 6000 years and is the source of evil in the world. He intends to rule the world by spreading darkness, hatred, sin and evil. It is said that the source of his strength is one-half of the \"Shakti Punj\" (the half which is referred to as \"shaktiman\") which he managed to retain after he originally obtained the entire Shakti Punj by deceit from Shri Satya (Satya means truth), the founder of the Suryavanshi. However, it is also mentioned that the source of his strength is the evil that is committed by people in this world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LB9JLeGRUIk|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 70|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nIt was later revealed that only Shri Satya can kill Tamraj Kilvish. After a death-defying adventure, Shaktimaan was told that he is the rebirth of Shri Satya. Shri Satya had given the exact time of the child's birth and the place before he died about 6000 years ago. Tamraj also knows this and this is the main reason he is frightened by the appearance of Shaktimaan as he knows that only Shaktimaan can kill Tamraj. He murdered Shaktimaan's parents and his adoptive father, Pandit Vidyadhar Shastri.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/s/shakti.htm |title=International Hero&nbsp;\u2013 Shaktimaan |accessdate=25 November 2011}}</ref> He and his minions plot to kill him but always fail. His minions include Electric-man (who can shoot lightning bolts from his body), Stone-man (who can shoot stones from his body), Plastica (who can stretch any part of her body), Dr. Jackal (an evil scientist) and others. Dr. Jackal has helped Kilvish in his various schemes by cloning Shaktimaan and also by turning aliens against him.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=189133 |newspaper=Indian Express |title=Bad Boys |date=21 June 2006 |author=Tushar Abhichandani |accessdate=23 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060919194526/http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=189133 |archivedate=19 September 2006  }}</ref>\n\nIn the television series, Kilvish is often treated as the personification of darkness itself even though he was once a human being who later becomes very powerful and commits many evil deeds. In an attempt to become immortal, he left his mortal body and took an ethereal body which can't be killed but Shaktimaan is told that he has to kill all the evil in the world to destroy Tamraj's ethereal body. Kilvish's trademark quote is \"Andhera Kaayam Rahe\" (May Darkness Prevail), which is also used by his followers.\n\nKilvish's character evolves as the series progresses. In the beginning episodes of Shaktimaan, his face is never shown and his voice is different from the voice that he uses in the later episodes of Shaktimaan, in which his role is played by [[Surendra Pal]]. Later his face deforms to become a distorted wolf-like face.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bakwaasbybiswas.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/kilwis.jpg|title=Bakwaas by Biswas (WordPress blog)|accessdate= 13 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n; Dr. Jackal\nDr. Jackal is an evil scientist who works for Kilvish. His earlier intention was not that of becoming evil, but when he was denied scholarship for research, Kilvish provided him with funds and labs, thus making him a supporter of Kilvish & an evil scientist.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iof2Ce4egp8|title=Shaktimaan Episode&nbsp;\u2013 224|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\nThough he is overall a brilliant scientist, his specialisation is cloning and various energy rays.\nHis creations against Shaktimaan include Kekda Man (a clone formed by fusing cells of Crab & human), followed by Jonk Jonkaa (a clone using leech), an evil clone of Shaktimaan, Plastica,\nLightman, 3D image, Super-heroine Sunanda and others. He also invented a height control solution and fictional EC- rays.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l14zW_E1VzI|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 120|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83uDEE69YlY|title=Shaktimaan Episode&nbsp;\u2013 28|publisher=YouTube.com 3 |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buecO_bwsls|title=Shaktimaan Episode&nbsp;\u2013 301|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-lG6uoeh7E|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 162|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVVTrBXe18s|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 38|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJf6yZZdkes|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 41 |publisher=YouTube.com |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDNhyZ5abCE|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 42 |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n; Sahab\nSahab is an organised criminal and drug lord. Like Shaktimaan he also possesses double identity, the other being that of a law-abiding industrialist and Mayor, known as Kumar Ranjan. Except for Tamraj Kilvish (and later Dr. Jackal), no one knows that Sahab and Kumar Ranjan are the same person, thus making this his biggest strength. Through his criminal mind, Sahab keeps plotting ways to create trouble for Shaktimaan or to defame him and to find out about the real identity of Shaktimaan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsseb6UtzyA&list|title=shaktimaan 10 1 2011 0002|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n==== Other enemies ====\n; Kakodar\nKakodar is a sorcerer with the visage of a devil who was imprisoned in a statue nearly five hundred years ago. He could only be freed if a good person removes a thread from his neck. It is unclear whether he was cursed by an enemy or punished by Tamraj to end up imprisoned. In the present day, the mayor of Mumbai, Jai Kumar Janardhan a.k.a. JJ (Nawab Shah) was deceived by his personal assistant Mathur (Deepak Bhatia) to break the thread and free him. Mayor JJ died in shock at seeing Kakodar's true form. As instructed by Madhur, Kakodar possessed JJ's body and decided to spread ''Andhera'' (darkness).\n\nHe was the primary super villain in the first part of the series as he uses JJ's wealth and power to hatch plots to kill Shaktimaan but always failed. Unlike most of other assailants of Shaktimaan, he is very sharp and analytical. He even tries to approach Tarendra, an all knowing sentient being of light, to know the truth about Shaktimaan. He is cunning enough to be able to use mental manipulation to trick Shaktimaan on occasion. This put the hero into a dilemma, and self-doubt drained him of his powers temporarily.\n\nThe full extent of his powers is not revealed. On an occasion, JJ's girlfriend Zuby realises that JJ is possessed by a demon and tries to reveal him in public. He uses hypnosis to drive her mad so that the public will ignore her statements. He has a potent and fatal poison inside him that he can spit out of his mouth which affects everyone except Shaktimaan. Shaktimaan and Kakodar end things in a fight when Kakodar turns into his real form and Shaktimaan turns him back to a statue.\n\n; Natasha\nNatasha (Sunila) was also a demonic evil woman sent by Kilvish. Along with Mathur she serves JJ/Kakodar. She was JJ's secretary before he was possessed. She has the ability to change her appearance. She kills a C.B.I. officer and takes her appearance to interrogate Gangadhar and Geeta on one occasion. Her powers were greatly diminished due to Shaktimaan defeating Kakodar. To regain power she and Madhur decide to sacrifice Shaktimaan. For this they kidnap the son of a scientist to get the formula of ''invisible man'' which may help defeating Shaktimaan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dHANSmJg6A|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 24 |publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n; Madhur\nMadhur (Deepak Bhatia) is one of the two trusted demonic accomplices of JJ/Kakodar along with Natasha. He initially served JJ as his personal assistant (PA) before he was possessed, but was secretly preparing the stage for Kakodar's entry under Tamraj's directions. His true identity is revealed after Kakodar is released from his imprisonment. Not many of his powers are revealed in the series. He has the ability to change his appearance at will, but not shape shift to assume someone else's body. He also loses his powers when Kakodar was defeated by Shaktimaan.\n\n; Electric-man\nHe was the first synthetic villain faced by Shaktimaan. Dr. Chandola, an evil scientist, created him. Dr. Chandola claims that Electric man was his son, whom he killed so that he can resurrect the dead body with electricity. When he comes to life he kills Dr. Chandola. Without recognising friend from foe he kills everyone in his path and spreads destruction in the city. His powers include shooting electricity from eyes and electrocution on contact. Finding him difficult to restrain, Shaktimaan grabs him and tunnels deep into the earth, pushing him deep underground.\n\n; Kapala\nKapala is a corrupted tantrik who serves Tamraj Kilvish. His primary skill is his shape shifting to inanimate objects such as vehicles and weapons. He also has many other magical devices and servants under his control. One such device is metal plate he wears around his neck that has the power to steal his opponent's strength. The villain Stone man was created from his magic skull. Shaktimaan destroys both the metal plate and the magic skull. He has an odd sense of humor as he makes jokes while fighting Shaktimaan. There are occasions where he serves as a comic relief. This is in contrast to other villains who are stark and serious. He also has a very fragile ego and falls victim to taunts. His main accessory is a trident. Shaktimaan eventually turns him into stone and shatters him at one instance. However, in later episodes of Shaktimaan, he is shown resurrected back to life. He is played by Faqira.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41PAj7P6qKk&list|title=shaktimaan 28 12 2010 0003|publisher=YouTube.com |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUChETYxkQo|title=shaktimaan 8 12 2010 0001 |publisher=YouTube.com |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n; Khali-Bali\nKhali and Bali are two dwarvish green and red imps. Their names originate from the Urdu word Khalbali which means commotion. Throughout their appearances they constantly argue and reconcile with each other over inane reasons. They claim to eat humans but there is no evidence regarding the same. They can combine to form a single full size demon. This demon wears a green and red garb. Their power is insignificant when they are separated but when they both combine they become as physically strong as a full-fledged demon. Not much is shown regarding any psychic powers they possess.\n\n; Kashtak\nDuring an archaeological dig in the ''qila''(fort) at Bhangdu Khati, the lead archaeologist Prof. Hussain and his assistant Hema discover a sarcophagus and a mysteriously untarnished sword made out of an unknown metal in the ruins. Hema accidentally opens the sarcophagus and unleashes Kashtak, a servant of Tamraj Kilvish. Kashtak used to terrorise the world and was imprisoned nearly 2500 years ago by the curse of Komalatha, a lady sage. [[Shaktimaan#Geeta Vishwas|Geeta Vishwas]] turns out to be the reincarnation of Komalatha. His sword ''Khadgi'' has many powers imbued in them such as telekinesis, petrification and resurrection and control of his army. In the series it is enhanced with the power of mind control by Tamraj. When he controls the mind of a scientist to create a weapon of mass destruction, Shaktimaan stops him .<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVda1QKR54s|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 30|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n; Kekda Man\nKekda man (Crab man) is one of the two dangerous clones of Dr. Jackal (along with Jonk Jonkaa). He is a clone created by Dr. Jackal by fusing cells of crab and a kidnapped Suryanshi. Dr. Jackal managed to twist the mind of the pure Suryanshi to become the Kekda man. He can breathe fire which contains an extremely dangerous poison that even impeded Shaktimaan. Shaktimaan left an illusion of him behind and narrowly escaped. Because he returns with only the illusion, Kekda man is destroyed by his short tempered creator.\n\n; Jonk Jonkaa\nJonk (leech) is one of the two most dangerous clones of Dr. Jackal (along with Kekda Man); He was created by fusing genes of humans and alien leech from Mars. He has the power to eat any form of matter and grow larger in size. He was killed by Geeta and the campers using salt. Shaktimaan is however captured in a flying prison in the process.\n\n; Evil clone Shaktimaan\nAfter capturing Shaktimaan, Dr. Jackal makes a clone of him, but twists his mind to be a servant of darkness. The evil clone is created stronger than Shaktimaan, and is unleashed on the world. When the real Shaktimaan escapes his prison, he challenges the evil clone to a fight. He then captures the clone and sends him into deep space.\n\n; Shalaka\nShalaka is a cat girl who has pledged to eliminate Shaktimaan. She first appears in episode 125 of the series in which she tries to harm Geeta. She is an accomplice of Tamraj Kilvish. She has a sister named Shaliyaa.

She later realises that the cat was her sister, Shaliyaa.\n\n; Teemiraa\nShe was another devil magician sent by Tamraaj to kill Shaktimaan in childhood but she failed.

Wallace wrote to [[Francis Knollys, 1st Viscount Knollys|Lord Knollys]], the [[Private Secretary to the Sovereign|king's private secretary]]: {{quote|What we have, as a nation, to fear is, I submit, not megalomania of the vulgar type called ''Swelled Head'', but the quiet persistent carrying out of a well-considered policy which aims at destroying our naval supremacy, with a view to appropriating a large portion of our colonial Empire.\"<ref>Roderick R.

Each thyroglobulin molecule contains approximately 100-120 tyrosine residues, but only a small number (20) of these are subject to iodination by [[thyroperoxidase]] in the follicular [[colloid]].

Circulating thyroglobulin has a half-life of 65 hours. Following thyroidectomy, it may take many weeks before thyroglobulin levels become undetectable. Thyroglobulin levels may be tested regularly for a few weeks or months following the removal of the thyroid.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/thyroglobulin/|title=Thyroglobulin: MedlinePlus Lab Test Information|website=medlineplus.gov|language=en|access-date=2019-05-06}}</ref> After thyroglobulin levels become undetectable (following thyroidectomy), levels can be serially monitored.{{what?|date=April 2016}}  \n\nA subsequent elevation of the thyroglobulin level is an indication of recurrence of papillary or follicular thyroid carcinoma. In other words, a rise in thyroglobulin levels in the blood may be a sign that thyroid cancer cells are growing and/or the cancer is spreading.<ref name=\":0\" /> Hence, thyroglobulin levels in the blood are mainly used as a [[tumor marker]]<ref name=\"urlACS :: Tumor Markers\">{{cite web | url = http://www.cancer.org/docroot/PED/content/PED_2_3X_Tumor_Markers.asp | publisher = American Cancer Society | title = ACS :: Tumor Markers  | work = | accessdate = 2009-03-28}}</ref> <ref name=\":0\" /> for certain kinds of [[thyroid cancer]] (particularly papillary or follicular thyroid cancer).  Thyroglobulin is not produced by medullary or anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. \n\nThyroglobulin levels are tested via a simple blood test. Tests are often ordered after thyroid cancer treatment. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Thyroglobulin antibodies ===\nIn the clinical laboratory, thyroglobulin testing can be complicated by the presence of anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (ATAs), alternatively referred to as TgAb. Anti-thyroglobulin antibodies are present in 1 in 10 normal individuals, and a greater percentage of patients with thyroid carcinoma. The presence of these antibodies can result in falsely low (or rarely falsely high) levels of reported thyroglobulin, a problem that can be somewhat circumvented by concomitant testing for the presence of ATAs.

The presence of these antibodies can result in falsely low (or rarely falsely high) levels of reported thyroglobulin, a problem that can be somewhat circumvented by concomitant testing for the presence of ATAs.
