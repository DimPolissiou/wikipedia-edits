''Thunder And Rainbows'' (1991, [[Sunnyside Records]]), by \"Jazz from Keystone\", is a trio album with Kirkland, [[Charles Fambrough]], and [[Jeff \"Tain\" Watts]].<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/album/thunder-and-rainbows-sunnyside-mw0000622864 Allmusic]</ref>\n\nLeading up to and on June 1\u20133, 1998, Kirkland worked with long-time associate Jeff \"Tain\" Watts on the drummer's debut recording ''Citizen Tain''. According to producer Delfeayo Marsalis, \"He was clearly not in good shape.\" When asked about going to the doctor, Kirkland responded, \"After the session. If I go now, they'll make me check into a hospital.\" On June 4, doctors told Kirkland he had a congestive heart condition that required an operation. He attributed his poor health to twenty years of touring without adequate vacations and exercise, and deemed his chances of surviving any surgery 50/50 or less. Fearful of having a cardiac procedure, Kirkland accepted his fate and was soon on the road with Branford Marsalis again. On November 7, 1998, Kirkland attended Marsalis's wedding in [[New Rochelle, New York]].  Kirkland was found dead in his Queens apartment on Friday, November 13, 1998.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/15/nyregion/body-of-jazz-pianist-is-found-police-seek-cause-of-death.html NYtimes obituary]</ref>\n\nThe official doctor's report listed his death as due to [[congestive heart failure]]. He was survived by his mother, a brother and two sisters.\n\n==Discography==\n\n===As leader===\n*''[[Kenny Kirkland (album)|Kenny Kirkland]]'' (1991)\n\n===As sideman===\n'''With [[Stone Alliance]]'''\n*''Heads Up'' (PM, 1980)   \n'''With [[Franco Ambrosetti]]'''\n*''[[Wings (Franco Ambrosetti album)|Wings]]'' (Enja, 1984)               \n'''With [[Carla Bley]]'''\n* ''[[Heavy Heart (album)|Heavy Heart]]'' (Watt, 1984)\n'''With [[Michael Brecker]]'''\n* ''[[Michael Brecker (album)|Michael Brecker]]'' (1987)\n'''With [[Chico Freeman]]'''\n*''[[Peaceful Heart, Gentle Spirit]]'' (Contemporary, 1980)\n*''[[Pied Piper]]'' (Jdc Records, 1999)\n'''With [[Kenny Garrett]]'''\n* ''[[Black Hope]] '' (1992)\n* ''Songbook'' (1997)\n'''With [[Dizzy Gillespie]]'''\n* ''[[Closer to the Source (Dizzy Gillespie album)|Closer to the Source]]'' (Atlantic, 1984)\n* ''[[New Faces (album)|New Faces]]'' (GRP, 1985)\n'''With [[Billy Hart]]'''\n*''[[Rah (Billy Hart album)|Rah]]'' (Gramavision, 1988)\n'''With [[Jay Hoggard]]'''\n*[[Rain Forest (Jay Hoggard album)|Rain Forest]](1980)   \n'''With [[Robert Hurst (musician)|Robert Hurst]]'''\n* ''One for Namesake'' (1994)\n'''With [[Elvin Jones]]'''\n* ''[[Earth Jones]]'' (Palo Alto, 1982)\n* ''[[Brother John (album)|Brother John]]'' (1982)\n'''With [[David Liebman]]'''\n* ''What It Is'' (CBS/Sony Inc 1980)\n'''With [[Wynton Marsalis]]'''\n* ''[[Wynton Marsalis (album)|Wynton Marsalis]]'' (1981)\n* ''[[Think of One]]'' (1983)\n* ''[[Hot House Flowers (album)|Hot House Flowers]]'' (1984)\n* ''[[Black Codes (From the Underground)|Black Codes]]'' (1985)\n'''With [[Branford Marsalis]]'''\n* ''Scenes in the City'' (1983)\n* ''Royal Garden Blues'' (1985)\n* ''Renaissance'' (1986)\n* ''[[Random Abstract (Branford Marsalis album)|Random Abstract]]'' (1987)\n* ''[[Crazy People Music (album)|Crazy People Music]]'' (1990)\n* ''[[Mo' Better Blues#Soundtrack|Mo' Better Blues]]'' Soundtrack (1990)\n* ''[[I Heard You Twice the First Time (album)|I Heard You Twice the First Time]]'' (1992)\n* ''[[Requiem (Branford Marsalis album)|Requiem]]'' (1999)\n'''With [[Delfeayo Marsalis]]'''\n* ''Pontius Pilate's Decision'' (1992)\n'''With [[Lew Soloff]]'''\n* ''But Beautiful'' (1987)\n'''With Sting'''\n* ''[[The Dream of the Blue Turtles]]'' (1985)\n* ''[[Bring on the Night]]'' (1986)\n* ''[[...Nothing Like the Sun]]'' (1987)\n* ''[[...Nada como el sol]]'' (1988)\n* ''[[The Soul Cages]]'' (1991)\n* ''[[Mercury Falling]]'' (1996)\n'''With [[Miroslav Vitous]]'''\n* ''[[First Meeting (Miroslav Vitou\u0161 album)|First Meeting]]'' (ECM, 1979)\n* ''[[Miroslav Vitous Group]]'' (ECM, 1980)\n'''With Jeff \"Tain\" Watts'''\n* ''Megawatts'' (1991)\n* ''Citizen Tain'' (1999)\n'''With [[John Scofield]]'''\n* ''[[Who's Who?]]'' (1979)\n'''With [[Arturo Sandoval]]'''\n* ''[[I Remember Clifford (album)|I Remember Clifford]]'' (1992)\n'''With [[Terence Blanchard]]'''\n* ''Jazz in Film'' (1999)\n'''With [[Hiram Bullock]]'''\n* '' From All Sides '' (1986)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.stonealliance.com/Kirkland/DailyTelegraph.htm Obituary reprinted from the Daily Telegraph]\n{{Branford Marsalis Quartet|state=autocollapse}} \n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kirkland, Kenny}}\n[[Category:1955 births]]\n[[Category:1998 deaths]]\n[[Category:African-American musicians]]\n[[Category:American jazz keyboardists]]\n[[Category:American jazz pianists]]\n[[Category:American male pianists]]\n[[Category:American male musicians]]\n[[Category:GRP Records artists]]\n[[Category:Manhattan School of Music alumni]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Brooklyn]]\n[[Category:20th-century American pianists]]\n[[Category:Jazz musicians from New York (state)]]\n[[Category:20th-century American male musicians]]\n[[Category:Male jazz musicians]]\n[[Category:GRP All-Star Big Band members]]\n[[Category:Branford Marsalis Quartet members]]\n[[Category:The Tonight Show Band members]]\n[[Category:A&M Records artists]]\n", "name_user": "Paploo", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDiscography", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Kirkland"}
