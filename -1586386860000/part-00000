These added Gothic features such as towers and battlements outside and elaborate decoration inside to create \"gloomth\" to suit Walpole's collection of antiquarian objects, contrasting with the more cheerful or \"riant\"<ref>The term is from French, literally meaning 'laughing'.</ref> garden. The interior included a [[Robert Adam]] fireplace; parts of the exterior were designed by [[James Essex]]. The garden contained a large seat shaped like a [[Rococo]] sea shell, which was recreated in the 2012 restoration of the garden, one of the many examples of [[historic garden conservation]] in the UK.\n\n==Under Horace Walpole==\n\n=== Purchase and planning ===\n[[File:Strawberry Hill.jpg|thumb|left|One of the towers]]\n\nIn May 1747, [[Horace Walpole]] took a lease on a small 17th-century house that was \"little more than a cottage\", with {{convert|5|acre|m2}} of land from a Mrs. Chenevix. Horace was under familial and political pressure to establish a country seat, especially a family castle, which was a fashionable practice during the period.<ref name=\"Strawberry Hill\">{{cite journal|last1=Lewis|first1=W.S.|title=The Genesis of Strawberry Hill|journal=Metropolitan Museum Studies|date=August 1934|volume=5|issue=1|page=57}}</ref> The following year he purchased the house which the original owner, a coachman, had named \"Chopped Straw Hall\". This was intolerable to Walpole, \"his residence ought, he thought, to possess some distinctive appellation; of a very different character...\" Finding an old lease that described his land as \"Strawberry Hill Shot\", Walpole adopted this new name for his soon to be \"elegant villa\".<ref name=Call722>Calloway et al. 1980, pp.7\u201322.</ref><ref name=Warb1128>Warburton 1851, pp.11\u201328.</ref>\n\nIn stages, Walpole rebuilt the house to his own specifications, giving it a Gothic style and expanding the property to {{convert|46|acre|m2}} over the years. As Rosemary Hill notes, \"Strawberry Hill was the first house without any existing medieval fabric to be [re]built from scratch in the Gothic style and the first to be based on actual historic examples, rather than an extrapolation of the Gothic vocabulary first developed by [[William Kent]]. As such it has a claim to be the starting point of the Gothic Revival.\"<ref>Hill, Rosemary, [http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article7130418.ece \"Welcome to Strawberry Hill: Chronology and Architecture at the Service of Horace Walpole\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615095835/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article7130418.ece |date=15 June 2011}}. ''Times Literary Supplement'', 19 May 2010.</ref>\n\nWalpole and two friends, including the connoisseur and amateur architect, John Chute (1701\u20131776), and draughtsman and designer, [[Richard Bentley (writer)|Richard Bentley]] (1708\u20131782), called themselves a \"Committee of Taste\" or \"Strawberry Committee\"<ref>Fothergill 1983, p.42.</ref> which would modify the architecture of the building. Bentley left the group abruptly after an argument in 1761. Chute had an \"eclectic but rather dry style\" and was in charge of designing most of the exterior of the house and some of the interior. To Walpole, he was an \"oracle of taste\". Walpole often disagreed with Bentley on some of his wayward schemes, but admired his talent for illustration.<ref name=Call722 />\n\n=== Construction ===\n[[File:Strawberryhill.jpg|right|thumb|An 18th-century engraving of the villa]]\n\nWilliam Robinson of the Royal [[Office of Works]] contributed professional experience in overseeing construction. They looked at many examples of architecture in England and in other countries, adapting such works as the chapel at [[Westminster Abbey]] built by Henry VII for inspiration for the fan vaulting of the gallery, without any pretence at scholarship. Chimney-pieces were improvised from engravings of tombs at Westminster and Canterbury and Gothic stone fretwork blind details were reproduced by painted wallpapers, while in the Round Tower added in 1771, the chimney-piece was based on the tomb of [[Edward the Confessor]] \"improved by [[Robert Adam|Mr. Adam]]\".\n\nHe incorporated many of the exterior details of cathedrals into the interior of the house. Externally there seemed to be two predominant styles 'mixed'; a style based on castles with turrets and battlements, and a style based on Gothic cathedrals with arched windows and stained glass.\n\nThe building evolved similarly to how a medieval cathedral often evolved over time, with no fixed plan from the beginning. Indeed, Michael Snodin argues, \"the most striking external feature of Strawberry Hill was its irregular plan and broken picturesque silhouette\".<ref name=Call722 /> Walpole added new features over a thirty-year period, as he saw fit.\n\nThe first stage to make, in Walpole's words, a 'little Gothic castle' began in 1749 and was complete by 1753, a second stage began in 1760, and there were other modifications such as work on the great north bedchamber in 1772, and the \"[[Lady Diana Beauclerk|Beauclerk]] Tower\" of the third phase of alterations, completed to designs of a professional architect, [[James Essex]], in 1776. The total cost came to about \u00a320,720.<ref name=Call722 />\n\nWalpole's 'little Gothic castle' has significance as one of the most influential individual buildings of such Rococo \"Gothick\" architecture which prefigured the later developments of the nineteenth century [[Gothic revival]], and for increasing the use of Gothic designs for houses. This style has variously been described as Georgian Gothic, Strawberry Hill Gothic, or Georgian Rococo.\n\n=== Interior and collection ===\n[[File:Robert Adam fireplace, Round room, Strawberry Hill.jpg|The Robert Adam fireplace in the round room|left|thumb]]\n\nWalpole's eccentric and unique style on the inside rooms of Strawberry Hill complemented the Gothic exterior. The house is described by Walpole as \"the scene that inspired, the author of ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]''\", though Michael Snodin has observed: \"it is an interesting comment on 18th-century sensibility that the melancholy interiors of ''The Castle of Otranto'' were suggested by the light, elegant, even whimsical rooms at Strawberry Hill\".<ref name=Call722 />\n\n[[File:2-page spread from A Description of Strawberry-Hill by Horace Walpole 1774.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75<!--format for double image-->|2-page spread from Walpole's ''A Description of Strawberry-Hill'', 1774, itemising his collection. On the right-hand page is the gothic detail \"[Portrait of] The same [[Sir Kenelm Digby|lady Digby]], as she was found dead in her bed;\"]]\n\nThe interiors of Walpole's \"little play-thing house\" were intended to be \"settings of Gothic 'gloomth' for Walpole's collection\". His collection of curious, singular, antiquarian objects was well publicized; Walpole himself published two editions of ''A Description of the Villa of Mr. Horace Walpole at Strawberry Hill''<ref>{{cite web |last1=Walpole |first1=Horace |title=texts A description of the villa of Horace Walpole, youngest son of Sir Robert Walpole earl of Orford, at Strawberry-hill, near Twickenham.

The character of the rooms at Strawberry Hill was \"created and dictated\" by Walpole's taste for antiquarianism. Though even without the collection present, the house \"retains a fairy-tale quality\".<ref name=Call722 />\n\nHorace Walpole's Strawberry Hill Collection of several thousand items can still be viewed today. The Lewis Walpole Library of Yale University now has a database which \"encompasses the entire range of art and artifacts from Walpole's collections, including all items whose location is currently known and those as yet untraced but known through a variety of historical records\".<ref name=LWL>[http://lwlimages.library.yale.edu/strawberryhill/ \"Horace Walpole's Strawberry Hill Collection\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002000044/http://lwlimages.library.yale.edu/strawberryhill/ |date=2 October 2011 }}. The Lewis Walpole Library, Yale University. 28 March 2011.</ref>\n\n=== Gardens ===\n[[File:Strawberry Hill SE Sandby.jpg|thumb|left|18th-century [[watercolour]] by [[Paul Sandby]]]]\n\nWalpole was as meticulous in designing and developing his gardens as he was improving his house, though \"his ignorance of horticulture at first embarrassed him a little\".<ref name=Warb1128 /> Improvements on the grounds were started even before work on the house. \nIn an essay titled \"On Modern Gardening\", Walpole expresses his own ideas as reflected in his Strawberry Hill grounds. Walpole's taste in landscape and gardening moved away from the traditional, formal layout of \"parterre, terraces, marble urns, statued fountains and \u2018canals measured by the line'\". The French or Italian taste seemed, to Walpole, alien to the English climate \"resulting in symmetrical and unnatural gardens\". Trees and shrubs were planted in \"natural groupings\" on the lawn. Walpole preferred to see all nature as a garden. He did not however appreciate the extravagant \"romantic grotto and that favorite eighteenth-century conceit, the hermitage\".<ref>Fothergill 1983, pp.44\u20135.</ref>\n\nFrom \"On Modern Gardening\": \"the fairest scenes, that depend on themselves alone, weary when often seen. The Doric portico, the Palladian bridge, the Gothic ruin, the Chinese pagoda, that surprise the stranger, soon lose their charms to their surfeited master. But the ornament whose merit soonest fades, is the hermitage, or scene adapted to contemplation. It is almost comic to set aside a quarter of one's garden to be melancholy in.\"<ref>Walpole 1931, p.60.</ref> Here, Walpole's separation of style between his house and grounds can be seen. A friend, Horace Mann, assumed that Walpole's garden would be similarly Gothic. Walpole responded; \"Gothic is merely architecture, and as one has a satisfaction in imprinting the gloomth of abbeys and cathedrals on one's house, so one's garden, on the contrary, is to be nothing but ''riant'', and the gaiety of nature\".<ref>Fothergill 1983, p.45.</ref>\n\nWalpole saw the modern English garden as a point of perfection: \"we have given the true model of gardening to the world; let other countries mimic or corrupt our taste; but let it reign here on its verdant throne, original by its elegant simplicity, and proud of no other art than that of softening nature's harshness and copying her graceful touch\". He was a follower of William Kent, one of the originators of the English landscape garden.<ref>Walpole 1931, pp.64\u20135.</ref><ref>Fothergill 1983, p.44.</ref>\n\nThe gardens are Grade II* listed on the [[Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England|Register of Historic Parks and Gardens]].<ref name=NHLEGarden>{{NHLE|num=1000214|desc=Strawberry Hill|access-date=14 August 2017|mode=cs2}}</ref>\n\n==== Shell bench ====\nOne particular attraction of Walpole's gardens was a Rococo garden seat carved to resemble a large sea shell. \"This shell was one of Mr. Walpole's favourite inventions \u2013 for Strawberry Hill was crammed with inventions and contrivances. It was a seat in the form of a huge bivalve of a species not easily recognized, which generally elicited a vast amount of wonder and admiration from his visitors\". This bench, a rustic cottage, and a [[Chapel in the Wood, Strawberry Hill|chapel in the woods]] show Walpole's charmingly eccentric taste.<ref>Warburton 1851, p.461.</ref>\n\nThe seat was originally placed at the corner of Walpole's estate, where Walpole and his visitors could view the river and the landscape beyond. Although only two drawings of the original bench survive, \"the garden is as far as possible being restored to its original appearance. Walpole's extraordinary Shell Bench has been recreated\" according to the Strawberry Hill website.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.strawberryhillhouse.org.uk/gardens.php |title=Strawberry Hill House \u2013 The Garden |work=The Strawberry Hill Trust |accessdate=15 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117034454/http://www.strawberryhillhouse.org.uk/gardens.php |archivedate=17 January 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Visitors ===\nEven in Walpole's lifetime, Strawberry Hill drew many visitors to admire the architecture, grounds, and Walpole's carefully cultivated collection. According to [[Elliot Warburton]], \"Strawberry Hill in its new form soon became the marvel of the neighbourhood \u2013 a little later became the town talk \u2013 in a short time a theme of frequent comment even in distant parts of the country\". \"The highest personages of the realm\" including the royal family came to visit Strawberry Hill, as well as more common sightseers. These visitors became an incessant addition to Strawberry Hill, and as delighted as Walpole was to share his vision, they became a bit of a nuisance to him. \nWhile Walpole gave tours to the more important visitors, he shrank from less dignified attention and \"retreated to his cottage in the flower garden\" while his housekeeper gave tours to the public.<ref name=LWL />\n\nIn a letter to George Montagu in 1763, Walpole complained: \"I have but a minute's time in answering your letter, my house is full of people, and has been so from the instant I breakfasted, and more are coming- in short, I keep an inn; the sign, the Gothic Castle...my whole time is passed in giving tickets for seeing it, and hiding myself when it is seen- take my advice, never build a charming house for yourself between London and Hampton-court, everybody will live in it but you.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.library.yale.edu/hwcorrespondence/page.asp?vol=10&page=98|title=Yale edition of Walpole's correspondence|website=images.library.yale.edu|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018212933/http://images.library.yale.edu/hwcorrespondence/page.asp?vol=10&page=98|archivedate=18 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Warburton notes that while Walpole may have been annoyed from time to time, he also came to see his estate contributing to the public's enjoyment when he had doubts about his endeavour. \"He arrives at the conclusion that all he has done is for the benefit of others rather than for himself\".<ref>Fothergill 1983, p.65.</ref><ref>Warburton 1851, pp.480\u20131.</ref>\n\n=== Chronology ===\n\nA list of important dates in Horace Walpole's life surrounding Strawberry Hill:<ref>Calloway et al. 1980, p.3.</ref>\n* 1739 \u2013 Sets off with Thomas Gray on the [[Grand Tour]]; visits France and Italy; meets John Chute in Florence\n* 1745 \u2013 Father dies, leaving Horace his fortune and a house on Arlington Street\n* 1747 \u2013 Finds and leases Strawberry Hill\n* 1749 \u2013 Purchases Strawberry Hill\n* 1750 \u2013 Forms the \"Committee on Taste\" with John Chute and Richard Bentley to start planning the Gothic development of Strawberry Hill\n* 1753 - Building completed (first stage)\n* 1757 \u2013 Sets up Strawberry Hill Press\n* 1764 \u2013 ''The Castle of Otranto'' is published\n* 1774 \u2013 Prints ''A Description of the Villa of Mr. Horace Walpole''\n* 1784 \u2013 Prints ''A Description of the Villa of Mr. Horace Walpole'' with new additions and illustrations\n\n==Later owners==\n\nAfter Walpole's death, the house passed first to his cousin [[Anne Seymour Damer]], then in 1797 to [[John Waldegrave, 6th Earl Waldegrave|John Waldegrave]], a grandson of [[Maria Walpole]], the illegitimate daughter of Walpole's older brother Edward. In the first half of the 19th century, two successive owners, brothers John and [[George Waldegrave, 7th Earl Waldegrave|George Waldegrave]], spent most of the family fortune, culminating in a \"Great Sale\" lasting twenty-four days held in the grounds in 1842 which left the house stripped of virtually all its contents.<ref name=G0910 /> From 1883\u20131887 the property was owned by [[Hermann de Stern|Baron Hermann de Stern]] (1815\u20131887), a German-born British banker.<ref name=\"conlabhermann\">{{cite web|title=HERMANN DE STERN 1883-1887|url=http://www.conlab.org/pages/StrawHillIndex/Occupants/OccHermStern.html|website=Architectural Conservation Laboratory|publisher=University of Pennsylvania School of Design|accessdate=April 24, 2016}}</ref> In 1923, it was bought by the Roman Catholic [[St Mary's University, Twickenham|St Mary's University College]], renamed St Mary's University, Twickenham in 2014.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.strawberryhillhouse.org.uk/st-marys-college.php | title=St Mary's University College | work=The Strawberry Hill Trust | accessdate=15 January 2013 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730064042/http://www.strawberryhillhouse.org.uk/st-marys-college.php | archivedate=30 July 2012 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== 21st century ==\nIn 2004, Strawberry Hill featured in the TV series ''[[Restoration (TV series)|Restoration]]''.

It is the type example of the \"Strawberry Hill Gothic\" style of architecture,<ref name=G0910>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/sep/23/strawberry-hill-open-public-gothic | title=Strawberry Hill will open doors to public once again | work=The Guardian | accessdate=15 January 2013 | date=12 September 2010 | last=Kennedy | first=Maev | url-status=live | archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20130116232732/https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/sep/23/strawberry-hill-open-public-gothic | archivedate=16 January 2013 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> and it prefigured the nineteenth-century Gothic Revival.\n\nWalpole rebuilt the existing house in stages starting in 1749, 1760, 1772 and 1776. These added Gothic features such as towers and battlements outside and elaborate decoration inside to create \"gloomth\" to suit Walpole's collection of antiquarian objects, contrasting with the more cheerful or \"riant\"<ref>The term is from French, literally meaning 'laughing'.</ref> garden. The interior included a [[Robert Adam]] fireplace; parts of the exterior were designed by [[James Essex]]. The garden contained a large seat shaped like a [[Rococo]] sea shell, which was recreated in the 2012 restoration of the garden, one of the many examples of [[historic garden conservation]] in the UK.\n\n==Under Horace Walpole==\n\n=== Purchase and planning ===\n[[File:Strawberry Hill.jpg|thumb|left|One of the towers]]\n\nIn May 1747, [[Horace Walpole]] took a lease on a small 17th-century house that was \"little more than a cottage\", with {{convert|5|acre|m2}} of land from a Mrs. Chenevix. Horace was under familial and political pressure to establish a country seat, especially a family castle, which was a fashionable practice during the period.<ref name=\"Strawberry Hill\">{{cite journal|last1=Lewis|first1=W.S.|title=The Genesis of Strawberry Hill|journal=Metropolitan Museum Studies|date=August 1934|volume=5|issue=1|page=57}}</ref> The following year he purchased the house which the original owner, a coachman, had named \"Chopped Straw Hall\". This was intolerable to Walpole, \"his residence ought, he thought, to possess some distinctive appellation; of a very different character...\" Finding an old lease that described his land as \"Strawberry Hill Shot\", Walpole adopted this new name for his soon to be \"elegant villa\".<ref name=Call722>Calloway et al. 1980, pp.7\u201322.</ref><ref name=Warb1128>Warburton 1851, pp.11\u201328.</ref>\n\nIn stages, Walpole rebuilt the house to his own specifications, giving it a Gothic style and expanding the property to {{convert|46|acre|m2}} over the years. As Rosemary Hill notes, \"Strawberry Hill was the first house without any existing medieval fabric to be [re]built from scratch in the Gothic style and the first to be based on actual historic examples, rather than an extrapolation of the Gothic vocabulary first developed by [[William Kent]]. As such it has a claim to be the starting point of the Gothic Revival.\"<ref>Hill, Rosemary, [http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article7130418.ece \"Welcome to Strawberry Hill: Chronology and Architecture at the Service of Horace Walpole\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615095835/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article7130418.ece |date=15 June 2011}}. ''Times Literary Supplement'', 19 May 2010.</ref>\n\nWalpole and two friends, including the connoisseur and amateur architect, John Chute (1701\u20131776), and draughtsman and designer, [[Richard Bentley (writer)|Richard Bentley]] (1708\u20131782), called themselves a \"Committee of Taste\" or \"Strawberry Committee\"<ref>Fothergill 1983, p.42.</ref> which would modify the architecture of the building. Bentley left the group abruptly after an argument in 1761. Chute had an \"eclectic but rather dry style\" and was in charge of designing most of the exterior of the house and some of the interior. To Walpole, he was an \"oracle of taste\". Walpole often disagreed with Bentley on some of his wayward schemes, but admired his talent for illustration.<ref name=Call722 />\n\n=== Construction ===\n[[File:Strawberryhill.jpg|right|thumb|An 18th-century engraving of the villa]]\n\nWilliam Robinson of the Royal [[Office of Works]] contributed professional experience in overseeing construction. They looked at many examples of architecture in England and in other countries, adapting such works as the chapel at [[Westminster Abbey]] built by Henry VII for inspiration for the fan vaulting of the gallery, without any pretence at scholarship. Chimney-pieces were improvised from engravings of tombs at Westminster and Canterbury and Gothic stone fretwork blind details were reproduced by painted wallpapers, while in the Round Tower added in 1771, the chimney-piece was based on the tomb of [[Edward the Confessor]] \"improved by [[Robert Adam|Mr. Adam]]\".\n\nHe incorporated many of the exterior details of cathedrals into the interior of the house. Externally there seemed to be two predominant styles 'mixed'; a style based on castles with turrets and battlements, and a style based on Gothic cathedrals with arched windows and stained glass.\n\nThe building evolved similarly to how a medieval cathedral often evolved over time, with no fixed plan from the beginning. Indeed, Michael Snodin argues, \"the most striking external feature of Strawberry Hill was its irregular plan and broken picturesque silhouette\".<ref name=Call722 /> Walpole added new features over a thirty-year period, as he saw fit.\n\nThe first stage to make, in Walpole's words, a 'little Gothic castle' began in 1749 and was complete by 1753, a second stage began in 1760, and there were other modifications such as work on the great north bedchamber in 1772, and the \"[[Lady Diana Beauclerk|Beauclerk]] Tower\" of the third phase of alterations, completed to designs of a professional architect, [[James Essex]], in 1776. The total cost came to about \u00a320,720.<ref name=Call722 />\n\nWalpole's 'little Gothic castle' has significance as one of the most influential individual buildings of such Rococo \"Gothick\" architecture which prefigured the later developments of the nineteenth century [[Gothic revival]], and for increasing the use of Gothic designs for houses. This style has variously been described as Georgian Gothic, Strawberry Hill Gothic, or Georgian Rococo.\n\n=== Interior and collection ===\n[[File:Robert Adam fireplace, Round room, Strawberry Hill.jpg|The Robert Adam fireplace in the round room|left|thumb]]\n\nWalpole's eccentric and unique style on the inside rooms of Strawberry Hill complemented the Gothic exterior. The house is described by Walpole as \"the scene that inspired, the author of ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]''\", though Michael Snodin has observed: \"it is an interesting comment on 18th-century sensibility that the melancholy interiors of ''The Castle of Otranto'' were suggested by the light, elegant, even whimsical rooms at Strawberry Hill\".<ref name=Call722 />\n\n[[File:2-page spread from A Description of Strawberry-Hill by Horace Walpole 1774.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75<!--format for double image-->|2-page spread from Walpole's ''A Description of Strawberry-Hill'', 1774, itemising his collection. On the right-hand page is the gothic detail \"[Portrait of] The same [[Sir Kenelm Digby|lady Digby]], as she was found dead in her bed;\"]]\n\nThe interiors of Walpole's \"little play-thing house\" were intended to be \"settings of Gothic 'gloomth' for Walpole's collection\". His collection of curious, singular, antiquarian objects was well publicized; Walpole himself published two editions of ''A Description of the Villa of Mr. Horace Walpole at Strawberry Hill''<ref>{{cite web |last1=Walpole |first1=Horace |title=texts A description of the villa of Horace Walpole, youngest son of Sir Robert Walpole earl of Orford, at Strawberry-hill, near Twickenham.

The character of the rooms at Strawberry Hill was \"created and dictated\" by Walpole's taste for antiquarianism. Though even without the collection present, the house \"retains a fairy-tale quality\".<ref name=Call722 />\n\nHorace Walpole's Strawberry Hill Collection of several thousand items can still be viewed today. The Lewis Walpole Library of Yale University now has a database which \"encompasses the entire range of art and artifacts from Walpole's collections, including all items whose location is currently known and those as yet untraced but known through a variety of historical records\".<ref name=LWL>[http://lwlimages.library.yale.edu/strawberryhill/ \"Horace Walpole's Strawberry Hill Collection\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002000044/http://lwlimages.library.yale.edu/strawberryhill/ |date=2 October 2011 }}. The Lewis Walpole Library, Yale University. 28 March 2011.</ref>\n\n=== Gardens ===\n[[File:Strawberry Hill SE Sandby.jpg|thumb|left|18th-century [[watercolour]] by [[Paul Sandby]]]]\n\nWalpole was as meticulous in designing and developing his gardens as he was improving his house, though \"his ignorance of horticulture at first embarrassed him a little\".<ref name=Warb1128 /> Improvements on the grounds were started even before work on the house. \nIn an essay titled \"On Modern Gardening\", Walpole expresses his own ideas as reflected in his Strawberry Hill grounds. Walpole's taste in landscape and gardening moved away from the traditional, formal layout of \"parterre, terraces, marble urns, statued fountains and \u2018canals measured by the line'\". The French or Italian taste seemed, to Walpole, alien to the English climate \"resulting in symmetrical and unnatural gardens\". Trees and shrubs were planted in \"natural groupings\" on the lawn. Walpole preferred to see all nature as a garden. He did not however appreciate the extravagant \"romantic grotto and that favorite eighteenth-century conceit, the hermitage\".<ref>Fothergill 1983, pp.44\u20135.</ref>\n\nFrom \"On Modern Gardening\": \"the fairest scenes, that depend on themselves alone, weary when often seen. The Doric portico, the Palladian bridge, the Gothic ruin, the Chinese pagoda, that surprise the stranger, soon lose their charms to their surfeited master. But the ornament whose merit soonest fades, is the hermitage, or scene adapted to contemplation. It is almost comic to set aside a quarter of one's garden to be melancholy in.\"<ref>Walpole 1931, p.60.</ref> Here, Walpole's separation of style between his house and grounds can be seen. A friend, Horace Mann, assumed that Walpole's garden would be similarly Gothic. Walpole responded; \"Gothic is merely architecture, and as one has a satisfaction in imprinting the gloomth of abbeys and cathedrals on one's house, so one's garden, on the contrary, is to be nothing but ''riant'', and the gaiety of nature\".<ref>Fothergill 1983, p.45.</ref>\n\nWalpole saw the modern English garden as a point of perfection: \"we have given the true model of gardening to the world; let other countries mimic or corrupt our taste; but let it reign here on its verdant throne, original by its elegant simplicity, and proud of no other art than that of softening nature's harshness and copying her graceful touch\". He was a follower of William Kent, one of the originators of the English landscape garden.<ref>Walpole 1931, pp.64\u20135.</ref><ref>Fothergill 1983, p.44.</ref>\n\nThe gardens are Grade II* listed on the [[Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England|Register of Historic Parks and Gardens]].<ref name=NHLEGarden>{{NHLE|num=1000214|desc=Strawberry Hill|access-date=14 August 2017|mode=cs2}}</ref>\n\n==== Shell bench ====\nOne particular attraction of Walpole's gardens was a Rococo garden seat carved to resemble a large sea shell. \"This shell was one of Mr. Walpole's favourite inventions \u2013 for Strawberry Hill was crammed with inventions and contrivances. It was a seat in the form of a huge bivalve of a species not easily recognized, which generally elicited a vast amount of wonder and admiration from his visitors\". This bench, a rustic cottage, and a [[Chapel in the Wood, Strawberry Hill|chapel in the woods]] show Walpole's charmingly eccentric taste.<ref>Warburton 1851, p.461.</ref>\n\nThe seat was originally placed at the corner of Walpole's estate, where Walpole and his visitors could view the river and the landscape beyond. Although only two drawings of the original bench survive, \"the garden is as far as possible being restored to its original appearance. Walpole's extraordinary Shell Bench has been recreated\" according to the Strawberry Hill website.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.strawberryhillhouse.org.uk/gardens.php |title=Strawberry Hill House \u2013 The Garden |work=The Strawberry Hill Trust |accessdate=15 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117034454/http://www.strawberryhillhouse.org.uk/gardens.php |archivedate=17 January 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Visitors ===\nEven in Walpole's lifetime, Strawberry Hill drew many visitors to admire the architecture, grounds, and Walpole's carefully cultivated collection. According to [[Elliot Warburton]], \"Strawberry Hill in its new form soon became the marvel of the neighbourhood \u2013 a little later became the town talk \u2013 in a short time a theme of frequent comment even in distant parts of the country\". \"The highest personages of the realm\" including the royal family came to visit Strawberry Hill, as well as more common sightseers. These visitors became an incessant addition to Strawberry Hill, and as delighted as Walpole was to share his vision, they became a bit of a nuisance to him. \nWhile Walpole gave tours to the more important visitors, he shrank from less dignified attention and \"retreated to his cottage in the flower garden\" while his housekeeper gave tours to the public.<ref name=LWL />\n\nIn a letter to George Montagu in 1763, Walpole complained: \"I have but a minute's time in answering your letter, my house is full of people, and has been so from the instant I breakfasted, and more are coming- in short, I keep an inn; the sign, the Gothic Castle...my whole time is passed in giving tickets for seeing it, and hiding myself when it is seen- take my advice, never build a charming house for yourself between London and Hampton-court, everybody will live in it but you.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.library.yale.edu/hwcorrespondence/page.asp?vol=10&page=98|title=Yale edition of Walpole's correspondence|website=images.library.yale.edu|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018212933/http://images.library.yale.edu/hwcorrespondence/page.asp?vol=10&page=98|archivedate=18 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Warburton notes that while Walpole may have been annoyed from time to time, he also came to see his estate contributing to the public's enjoyment when he had doubts about his endeavour. \"He arrives at the conclusion that all he has done is for the benefit of others rather than for himself\".<ref>Fothergill 1983, p.65.</ref><ref>Warburton 1851, pp.480\u20131.</ref>\n\n=== Chronology ===\n\nA list of important dates in Horace Walpole's life surrounding Strawberry Hill:<ref>Calloway et al. 1980, p.3.</ref>\n* 1739 \u2013 Sets off with Thomas Gray on the [[Grand Tour]]; visits France and Italy; meets John Chute in Florence\n* 1745 \u2013 Father dies, leaving Horace his fortune and a house on Arlington Street\n* 1747 \u2013 Finds and leases Strawberry Hill\n* 1749 \u2013 Purchases Strawberry Hill\n* 1750 \u2013 Forms the \"Committee on Taste\" with John Chute and Richard Bentley to start planning the Gothic development of Strawberry Hill\n* 1753 - Building completed (first stage)\n* 1757 \u2013 Sets up Strawberry Hill Press\n* 1764 \u2013 ''The Castle of Otranto'' is published\n* 1774 \u2013 Prints ''A Description of the Villa of Mr. Horace Walpole''\n* 1784 \u2013 Prints ''A Description of the Villa of Mr. Horace Walpole'' with new additions and illustrations\n\n==Later owners==\n\nAfter Walpole's death, the house passed first to his cousin [[Anne Seymour Damer]], then in 1797 to [[John Waldegrave, 6th Earl Waldegrave|John Waldegrave]], a grandson of [[Maria Walpole]], the illegitimate daughter of Walpole's older brother Edward. In the first half of the 19th century, two successive owners, brothers John and [[George Waldegrave, 7th Earl Waldegrave|George Waldegrave]], spent most of the family fortune, culminating in a \"Great Sale\" lasting twenty-four days held in the grounds in 1842 which left the house stripped of virtually all its contents.<ref name=G0910 /> From 1883\u20131887 the property was owned by [[Hermann de Stern|Baron Hermann de Stern]] (1815\u20131887), a German-born British banker.<ref name=\"conlabhermann\">{{cite web|title=HERMANN DE STERN 1883-1887|url=http://www.conlab.org/pages/StrawHillIndex/Occupants/OccHermStern.html|website=Architectural Conservation Laboratory|publisher=University of Pennsylvania School of Design|accessdate=April 24, 2016}}</ref> In 1923, it was bought by the Roman Catholic [[St Mary's University, Twickenham|St Mary's University College]], renamed St Mary's University, Twickenham in 2014.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.strawberryhillhouse.org.uk/st-marys-college.php | title=St Mary's University College | work=The Strawberry Hill Trust | accessdate=15 January 2013 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730064042/http://www.strawberryhillhouse.org.uk/st-marys-college.php | archivedate=30 July 2012 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== 21st century ==\nIn 2004, Strawberry Hill featured in the TV series ''[[Restoration (TV series)|Restoration]]''.

And if they didn't like it, when they looked at their phones they could just click something else; ... we are all so used to being entertained at the click of a button.\"\n\n\"So when you're [busking] on the street, .. to command [your] attention, people would be like: 'again! again!' .. 'more! more!' .. or they would just leave. So if you replace [the lyric]: 'dance for me, dance for me' with 'sing for me, sing for me,' it's pretty literal,\" she said.<ref>https://www.novafm.com.au/show/smallzys-surgery/tones-and-i-explains-how-she-went-busker-festival-performer-within-year/</ref>\n\n==Music video==\nThe music video was produced by Visible Studios, directed by Liam Kelly and Nick Kozakis and released on 24 June 2019.<ref name=\"Dance Monkey video\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0hyYWKXF0Q|title=Tones and I \u2013 Dance Monkey (Official Video)|via=YouTube|date=24 June 2019|accessdate=20 July 2019}}</ref> The video follows \"Mr. Tones\" ([[Tones and I]]), an elderly man who sneaks out of his home to have a dance party at a golf course with other senior citizens.

Working in the [[bebop]] and [[hard bop]] idioms early in his career, Coltrane helped pioneer the use of [[Modal jazz|modes]] and was at the forefront of [[free jazz]]. He led at least fifty recording sessions  and appeared on many albums by other musicians, including trumpeter [[Miles Davis]] and pianist [[Thelonious Monk]]. Over the course of his career, Coltrane's music took on an increasingly spiritual dimension. He remains one of the most influential saxophonists in music history. He received many posthumous awards, including [[canonization]] by the [[African Orthodox Church]] and a [[Pulitzer Prize]] in 2007.<ref name=pulitzer>{{cite web |url=http://www.pulitzer.org/citation/2007-Special-Awards-and-Citations |title=The 2007 Pulitzer Prize Winners: Special Awards and Citations |accessdate=June 29, 2009 |publisher=The Pulitzer Prizes}} With reprint of short biography.</ref> His second wife was pianist and harpist [[Alice Coltrane]].

Heath recalls an incident in a hotel in San Francisco when after a complaint was issued, Coltrane took the horn out of his mouth and practiced fingering for a full hour.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yaf6TNfuDuk|title=John Coltrane's Work Ethic|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=7 December 2019}}</ref> Such was his dedication it was common for him to fall asleep with the horn still in his mouth or practice a single note for hours on end.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uEkIAQAAMAAJ&q=coltrane+asleep+horn&dq=coltrane+asleep+horn|author=Woideck, Carl|title=The John Coltrane Companion: Five Decades of Commentary|publisher=Schirmer Books|p=29|year=1998|isbn=9780028647906}}</ref>\n\nAn important moment in the progression of Coltrane's musical development occurred on June 5, 1945, when he saw [[Charlie Parker]] perform for the first time. In a ''DownBeat'' magazine article in 1960 he recalled, \"the first time I heard Bird play, it hit me right between the eyes.\" Parker became an idol, and they played together occasionally in the late 1940s. He was a member of groups led by [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Earl Bostic]], and [[Johnny Hodges]] in the early to mid-1950s.\n\n===1955\u20131957: Miles and Monk period===\nIn the summer of 1955, Coltrane was freelancing in Philadelphia while studying with guitarist [[Dennis Sandole]] when he received a call from Davis. The trumpeter, whose success during the late forties had been followed by several years of decline in activity and reputation, due in part to his struggles with [[heroin]], was again active and about to form a quintet. Coltrane was with this edition of the Davis band (known as the \"First Great Quintet\"\u2014along with [[Red Garland]] on piano, [[Paul Chambers]] on bass, and [[Philly Joe Jones]] on drums) from October 1955 to April 1957 (with a few absences). During this period Davis released several influential recordings that revealed the first signs of Coltrane's growing ability. This quintet, represented by two marathon recording sessions for [[Prestige Records|Prestige]] in 1956, resulted in the albums ''[[Cookin' with The Miles Davis Quintet|Cookin'<nowiki/>]]'', ''[[Relaxin' with The Miles Davis Quintet|Relaxin'<nowiki/>]]'', ''[[Workin' with The Miles Davis Quintet|Workin']]'', and ''[[Steamin' with The Miles Davis Quintet|Steamin']]''. The \"First Great Quintet\" disbanded due in part to Coltrane's heroin addiction.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/07/movies/critic-s-notebook-the-miracle-of-coltrane-dead-at-40-still-vital-at-75.html|title=CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK; The Miracle of Coltrane: Dead at 40, Still Vital at 75|first=Ben|last=Ratliff|date=December 7, 2001|accessdate=March 29, 2019|website=Nytimes.com}}</ref>\n\nDuring the later part of 1957 Coltrane worked with [[Thelonious Monk]] at New York's [[Five Spot Caf\u00e9]], and played in Monk's quartet (July\u2013December 1957), but, owing to contractual conflicts, took part in only one official studio recording session with this group. Coltrane recorded many albums for Prestige under his own name at this time, but Monk refused to record for his old label.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blackthen.com/john-coltrane-legendary-revolutionary-saxophonist-history-jazz-music/|title=John Coltrane: Legendary and Revolutionary Saxophonist in the History of Jazz Music|website=Blackthen.com|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> A private recording made by Juanita Naima Coltrane of a 1958 reunion of the group was issued by Blue Note Records as ''Live at the Five Spot\u2014Discovery!'' in 1993. A high quality tape of a concert given by this quartet in November 1957 was also found later, and was released by Blue Note in 2005. Recorded by [[Voice of America]], the performances confirm the group's reputation, and the resulting album, ''[[Thelonious Monk Quartet with John Coltrane at Carnegie Hall]]'', is widely acclaimed.\n\n''[[Blue Train (album)|Blue Train]]'', Coltrane's sole date as leader for Blue Note, featuring trumpeter [[Lee Morgan]], bassist [[Paul Chambers]], and trombonist [[Curtis Fuller]], is often considered his best album from this period. Four of its five tracks are original Coltrane compositions, and the title track, \"Moment's Notice\", and \"[[Lazy Bird]]\", have become standards. Both tunes employed the first examples of his chord substitution cycles known as [[Coltrane changes]].\n\n===1958: Davis and Coltrane===\nColtrane rejoined Davis in January 1958. In October of that year, jazz critic [[Ira Gitler]] coined the term \"[[sheets of sound]]\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.allaboutjazz.com/john-coltrane-sheets-of-sound.php|title=Jazz news: John Coltrane: Sheets of Sound|website=News.allaboutjazz.com|accessdate=October 15, 2019}}</ref> to describe the style Coltrane developed with Monk and was perfecting in Davis's group, now a sextet. His playing was compressed, with rapid runs cascading in hundreds of notes per minute. He stayed with Davis until April 1960, working with alto saxophonist [[Cannonball Adderley]]; pianists [[Red Garland]], [[Bill Evans]], and [[Wynton Kelly]]; bassist [[Paul Chambers]]; and drummers [[Philly Joe Jones]] and [[Jimmy Cobb]]. During this time he participated in the Davis sessions ''[[Milestones (Miles Davis album)|Milestones]]'' and ''[[Kind of Blue]]'', and the concert recordings ''[[Miles & Monk at Newport]]'' (1963) and ''[[Jazz at the Plaza Vol. I|Jazz at the Plaza]] (1958)''.\n\n===1959\u20131961: Period with Atlantic Records===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2018}}\nAt the end of this period Coltrane recorded ''[[Giant Steps]]'' (1959), his first album as leader for [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]] which contained only his compositions. The album's title track is generally considered to have one of the most difficult chord progressions of any widely played jazz composition. ''Giant Steps'' uses [[Coltrane changes]]. His development of these altered chord progression cycles led to further experimentation with improvised melody and harmony that he continued throughout his career.\n{| border=\"0\"  style=\"float:right; font-size:100%; color:black; width:130px;\"\n|\n{{Listen|pos = right\n |filename = Giant Steps.ogg\n |title = 'Giant Steps'\n |description = One of Coltrane's most acclaimed recordings, \"Giant Steps\" features harmonic structures more complex than were used by most musicians of the time.\n}}\n|}\n\nColtrane formed his first quartet for live performances in 1960 for an appearance at the Jazz Gallery in New York City. After moving through different personnel, including [[Steve Kuhn]], [[Pete La Roca]], and [[Billy Higgins]], he kept pianist [[McCoy Tyner]], bassist [[Steve Davis (bassist)|Steve Davis]], and drummer [[Elvin Jones]]. Tyner, a native of Philadelphia, had been a friend of Coltrane for some years, and the two men had an understanding that Tyner would join the band when he felt ready. ''[[My Favorite Things (John Coltrane album)|My Favorite Things]]'' (1961) was the first album recorded by this band. It was Coltrane's first album on [[soprano saxophone]], which he began playing with Miles Davis. It was considered an unconventional move because the instrument was not as popular in jazz as other types of saxophone.\n\n===1961\u20131962: First years with Impulse Records===\n[[File:JohnColtrane1961.jpg|left|thumb|Coltrane in Amsterdam, 1961)]]\n\nIn May 1961, Coltrane's contract with Atlantic was bought by [[Impulse! Records|Impulse!]].<ref name=\"Ratliff\">{{cite book |last1=Ratliff |first1=Ben |title=Coltrane: The story of a Sound |url=https://archive.org/details/coltranestoryofs0000ratl |url-access=registration |date=2007 |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |location=New York |isbn=978-0-374-12606-3 |edition=1st}}</ref> The move to Impulse! meant that Coltrane resumed his recording relationship with engineer [[Rudy Van Gelder]], who had recorded his and Davis's sessions for Prestige. He recorded most of his albums for Impulse! at Van Gelder's studio in [[Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey]].\n\nBy early 1961, bassist Davis had been replaced by [[Reggie Workman]], while [[Eric Dolphy]] joined the group as a second horn. The quintet had a celebrated and extensively recorded residency at the [[Village Vanguard]], which demonstrated Coltrane's new direction. It included the most experimental music he had played, influenced by Indian [[ragas]], [[modal jazz]], and [[free jazz]]. [[John Gilmore (musician)|John Gilmore]], a longtime saxophonist with musician [[Sun Ra]], was particularly influential; after hearing a Gilmore performance, Coltrane is reported to have said, \"He's got it! Gilmore's got the concept!\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Corbett |first=John |title=John Gilmore: The Hard Bop Homepage |journal=[[Down Beat]]}}</ref> The most celebrated of the Vanguard tunes, the 15-minute blues \"Chasin' the 'Trane\", was strongly inspired by Gilmore's music.<ref name=\"kofsky\">{{cite book |first=Frank |last=Kofsky |title=Black Nationalism and the Revolution in Music: John Coltrane: An Interview |publisher=Pathfinder Press |year=1970 |page=235 }}</ref>\n\nDuring this period, critics were divided in their estimation of Coltrane, who had radically altered his style. Audiences, too, were perplexed; in France he was booed during his final tour with Davis. In 1961, ''Down Beat'' magazine called Coltrane and Dolphy players of \"anti-jazz\" in an article that bewildered and upset the musicians.<ref name=\"kofsky\" /> Coltrane admitted some of his early solos were based mostly on technical ideas. Furthermore, Dolphy's angular, voice-like playing earned him a reputation as a figurehead of the \"New Thing\", also known as free jazz, a movement led by [[Ornette Coleman]] which was denigrated by some jazz musicians (including Davis) and critics. But as Coltrane's style developed, he was determined to make every performance \"a whole expression of one's being\".<ref>Nisenson, p. 179</ref>\n\n===1962\u20131965: Classic Quartet period===\n{{Listen|pos = right\n |filename = In a Sentimental Mood sample.ogg\n |title = 'In a Sentimental Mood'\n |description = The romantic ballad features Coltrane with pianist Duke Ellington.\n}}\nIn 1962, Dolphy departed and [[Jimmy Garrison]] replaced Workman as bassist. From then on, the \"Classic Quartet\", as it came to be known, with Tyner, Garrison, and Jones, produced searching, spiritually driven work. Coltrane was moving toward a more harmonically static style that allowed him to expand his improvisations rhythmically, melodically, and motivically. Harmonically complex music was still present, but on stage Coltrane heavily favored continually reworking his \"standards\": \"Impressions\", \"My Favorite Things\", and \"I Want to Talk About You\".\n\nThe criticism of the quintet with Dolphy may have affected Coltrane. In contrast to the radicalism of his 1961 recordings at the Village Vanguard, his studio albums in the following two years (with the exception of ''[[Coltrane (1962 album)|Coltrane]]'', 1962, which featured a blistering version of [[Harold Arlen]]'s \"Out of This World\") were much more conservative. He recorded an album of ballads and participated in album collaborations with [[Duke Ellington and John Coltrane|Duke Ellington]] and singer [[John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman|Johnny Hartman]], a baritone who specialized in ballads. The album ''[[Ballads (John Coltrane album)|Ballads]]'' (recorded 1961\u201362) is emblematic of Coltrane's versatility, as the quartet shed new light on old-fashioned standards such as \"It's Easy to Remember\". Despite a more polished approach in the studio, in concert the quartet continued to balance \"standards\" and its own more exploratory and challenging music, as can be heard on the ''[[Impressions (John Coltrane album)|Impressions]]'' (recorded 1961\u201363), ''[[Live at Birdland (1964 John Coltrane album)|Live at Birdland]]'' and ''[[Newport '63]]'' (both recorded 1963). ''Impressions'' consists of two extended jams including the title track along with \"Dear Old Stockholm\", \"After the Rain\" and a blues. Coltrane later said he enjoyed having a \"balanced catalogue.\"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nNZQCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT192&lpg=PT192&dq=%22Coltrane+later+said+he+enjoyed+having+a+%22balanced+catalogue.%22%22#v=onepage&q=%22Coltrane+later+said+he+enjoyed+having+a+%22balanced+catalogue.%22%22&f=false|title=The History of Jazz and the Jazz Musicians|date=March 13, 2013|publisher=Lulu Press, Inc|accessdate=March 29, 2019|via=Google Books|isbn=9781257544486}}</ref>\n\nOn March 6, 1963, the group entered [[Van Gelder Studio]] in New Jersey and recorded a session that was lost for decades after its master tape was destroyed by Impulse Records to cut down on storage space.

A culmination of much of Coltrane's work up to this point, this four-part suite is an ode to his faith in and love for God. These spiritual concerns characterized much of Coltrane's composing and playing from this point onwards\u2014as can be seen from album titles such as ''Ascension'', ''Om'' and ''Meditations''. The fourth movement of ''A Love Supreme'', \"Psalm\", is, in fact, a musical setting for an original poem to God written by Coltrane, and printed in the album's liner notes. Coltrane plays almost exactly one note for each syllable of the poem, and bases his phrasing on the words. The album was composed at [[John Coltrane Home|Coltrane's home]] in [[Dix Hills, New York|Dix Hills]] on Long Island.\n\nThe quartet played ''A Love Supreme'' live only once\u2014in July 1965 at a concert in [[Antibes]], France.\n<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jazzwisemagazine.com/breaking-news/13655-50th-anniversary-of-coltrane-s-a-love-supreme-celebrated-by-gary-crosby-quartet-southbank |title=50th anniversary of Coltrane's A Love Supreme celebrated by Gary Crosby Quartet at Southbank |last=Flynn |first=Mike|website=Jazzwisemagazine.com|access-date=July 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===1965: Avant-garde jazz and the second quartet===\n[[File:PharoahSanders.jpg|thumb|right|As Coltrane's interest in jazz became experimental, he added Pharoah Sanders (center; circa 1978) to his ensemble.]]\nIn his late period, Coltrane showed an interest in the [[avant-garde jazz]] of Ornette Coleman,<ref>{{cite web|last=Richardson|first=Mark|title=New York Is Killing Me: Albert Ayler\u2019s Life and Death in the Jazz Capital|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/from-the-pitchfork-review/9857-new-york-is-killing-me-albert-aylers-life-and-death-in-the-jazz-capital/|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=April 28, 2016|accessdate=January 16, 2020}}</ref> [[Albert Ayler]],<ref name=\"beta\">{{cite web|last=Beta|first=Andy|title=Astral Traveling: The Ecstasy of Spiritual Jazz|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/pitchfork-essentials/9724-astral-traveling-the-ecstasy-of-spiritual-jazz/|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=September 25, 2015|accessdate=January 16, 2020}}</ref> and Sun Ra.

A series of recordings with the Classic Quartet in the first half of 1965 show Coltrane's playing becoming abstract, with greater incorporation of devices like [[multiphonics]], use of overtones, and playing in the [[altissimo]] register, as well as a mutated return of Coltrane's sheets of sound. In the studio, he all but abandoned soprano saxophone to concentrate on tenor. The quartet responded by playing with increasing freedom. The group's evolution can be traced through the albums ''[[The John Coltrane Quartet Plays]]'', ''[[Living Space (album)|Living Space]]'', ''[[Transition (John Coltrane album)|Transition]]'', ''[[New Thing at Newport]]'', ''[[Sun Ship]]'', and ''[[First Meditations]]''.\n\nIn June 1965, he went into Van Gelder's studio with ten other musicians (including Shepp,<ref name=\"aceves\">{{cite web|last=Aceves|first=Rusty|title=A Look Back At John Coltrane's Ascension|url=https://www.sfjazz.org/onthecorner/look-back-john-coltranes-ascension|work=[[SFJAZZ Center]]|date=January 27, 2017|accessdate=January 16, 2020}}</ref> [[Pharoah Sanders]],<ref name=\"aceves\"/> [[Freddie Hubbard]],<ref name=\"aceves\"/> [[Marion Brown]], and [[John Tchicai]]<ref name=\"aceves\"/>) to record ''[[Ascension (John Coltrane album)|Ascension]]'', a 38-minute piece that included solos by young avant-garde musicians.<ref name=\"bray\"/> The album was controversial primarily for the collective improvisation sections that separated the solos. After recording with the quartet over the next few months, Coltrane invited Sanders to join the band in September 1965. While Coltrane frequently used over-blowing as an emotional exclamation-point, Sanders would overblow entire solos, resulting in a constant screaming and screeching in the [[altissimo]] range of the instrument.\n\n===1965\u20131967: Adding to the quartet===\n[[File:Rashied Ali.jpg|thumb|Percussionist Rashied Ali (pictured in 2007) augmented Coltrane's sound.]]\n\nBy late 1965, Coltrane was regularly augmenting his group with Sanders and other free jazz musicians. [[Rashied Ali]] joined the group as a second drummer. This was the end of the quartet. Claiming he was unable to hear himself over the two drummers, Tyner left the band shortly after the recording of ''[[Meditations (John Coltrane album)|Meditations]]''. Jones left in early 1966, dissatisfied by sharing drumming duties with Ali. After Coltrane's death, Tyner and Jones  in interviews expressed displeasure with the music's direction, while incorporating some of the free-jazz form's intensity in their solo work.\n\nThere is speculation that in 1965 Coltrane began using [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]],<ref>Porter, pp. 265\u2013266.</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=John Coltrane: Divine Wind|journal=The Wire |date=January 30, 2008 |first=Howard |last=Mandel |issue=221 |url=http://www.thewire.co.uk/articles/539/?pageno=5|accessdate=June 29, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929010714/http://www.thewire.co.uk/articles/539/?pageno=5|archivedate=September 29, 2009}}</ref> informing the \"cosmic\" transcendence of his late period. After the departure of Tyner and Jones, Coltrane led a quintet with Sanders on tenor saxophone, his second wife [[Alice Coltrane]] on piano, Garrison on bass, and Ali on drums. Coltrane and Sanders were described by [[Nat Hentoff]] as \"[[glossolalia|speaking in tongues]]\". When touring, the group was known for playing long versions of their repertoire, many stretching beyond 30 minutes to an hour. In concert, solos by band members often extended beyond fifteen minutes.\n\nThe group can be heard on several concert recordings from 1966, including ''[[Live at the Village Vanguard Again!]]'' and ''[[Live in Japan (John Coltrane album)|Live in Japan]]''. In 1967, Coltrane entered the studio several times. Although pieces with Sanders have surfaced (the unusual \"To Be\" has both men on flute), most of the recordings were either with the quartet minus Sanders (''[[Expression (album)|Expression]]'' and ''[[Stellar Regions]]'') or as a duo with Ali. The latter duo produced six performances that appear on the album ''[[Interstellar Space]]''.\n\n===1967: Death===\nColtrane died of liver cancer at the age of 40 on July 17, 1967, at [[North Shore LIJ Health System#Hospitals|Huntington Hospital]] on Long Island. His funeral was held four days later at St. Peter's Lutheran Church in New York City. The service was started by the Albert Ayler Quartet and finished by the Ornette Coleman Quartet. Coltrane is buried at Pinelawn Cemetery in Farmingdale, New York.\n\nBiographer Lewis Porter suggested that the cause of Coltrane's illness was hepatitis, although he also attributed the disease to Coltrane's heroin use.<ref>Porter, p. 292</ref> Coltrane's death surprised many in the music community who were unaware of his condition. Miles Davis said, \"Coltrane's death shocked everyone, took everyone by surprise. I knew he hadn't looked too good... But I didn't know he was that sick\u2014or even sick at all.\"<ref>Porter, p. 290</ref>\n\n==Instruments==\nIn 1947, when he joined [[King Kolax]]'s band, Coltrane switched to tenor saxophone, the instrument he became known for playing.<ref name=\"Ruhlmann\">{{cite web |last1=Ruhlmann |first1=William |title=John Coltrane |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/john-coltrane-mn0000175553/biography |website=AllMusic |accessdate=November 25, 2018}}</ref> In the early 1960s, during his engagement with Atlantic, he played soprano saxophone.<ref name=\"Ruhlmann\" />\n\nHis preference for playing melody higher on the range of the tenor saxophone is attributed to his  training on alto horn and clarinet.

He would often have a spare drum set on concert stages that he would play. His interest in the drums and his penchant for having solos with the drums resonated on tracks such as \"Pursuance\" and \"The Drum Thing\" from ''[[A Love Supreme]]'' and ''[[Crescent (John Coltrane album)|Crescent]]'', respectively. It resulted in the album ''[[Interstellar Space]]'' with Ali.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allaboutjazz.com/rashied-ali-rashied-ali-by-hank-shteamer.php |title=Rashied Ali |last=Jazz |first=All About |website=All About Jazz |access-date=March 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\nColtrane's tenor ([[Selmer Mark VI]], serial number 125571, dated 1965) and soprano (Selmer Mark VI, serial number 99626, dated 1962) saxophones were auctioned on February 20, 2005 to raise money for the John Coltrane Foundation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://drrick.com/trane/trane.htm|publisher=drrick.com|title=John Coltrane's Saxophones |accessdate=April 7, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAlthough he rarely played alto, he owned a prototype Yamaha alto saxophone given to him by the company as an endorsement in 1966. He can be heard playing it on live albums recorded in Japan, such as ''Second Night in Tokyo'', and is pictured using it on the cover of the compilation ''[[Live in Japan (John Coltrane album)|Live in Japan]]''.

He was influenced by religion and spirituality beginning in childhood. His maternal grandfather, the Reverend William Blair, was a minister at an [[African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church]]<ref name=\"Porter5-6\">Porter, pp. 5-6</ref><ref>Lavezzoli, p. 270</ref> in [[High Point, North Carolina]], and his paternal grandfather, the Reverend William H. Coltrane, was an A.M.E. Zion minister in [[Hamlet, North Carolina]].<ref name=\"Porter5-6\"/> Critic Norman Weinstein noted the parallel between Coltrane's music and his experience in the southern church,<ref name=\"Weinstein\">{{cite book |last1=Weinstein |first1=Norman C. |title=A Night in Tunisia: Imaginings of Africa in Jazz |date=1933 |publisher=Hal Leonard |isbn=0-87910-167-9 |page=61 }}</ref> which included practicing music there as a youth.\n\nIn 1955, Coltrane married Naima (n\u00e9e Juanita Grubbs). Naima Coltrane, a Muslim convert, heavily influenced his spirituality. When they married, she had a five-year-old daughter named Antonia, later named Syeeda. Coltrane adopted Syeeda. He met Naima at the home of bassist Steve Davis in Philadelphia. The love ballad he wrote to honor his wife, \"Naima\", was Coltrane's favorite composition. In 1956 the couple left Philadelphia with their six-year-old daughter in tow and moved to New York City. In August 1957, Coltrane, Naima and Syeeda moved into an apartment on 103rd St. and Amsterdam Ave. in New York. A few years later, John and Naima Coltrane purchased a home at 116-60 Mexico Street in [[St. Albans, Queens]].<ref name=\"PorterDeVito2013\">{{cite book |last1=Porter |first1=Lewis |last2=DeVito |first2=Chris |last3=Wild |first3=David |title=The John Coltrane Reference |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IvlVu9XCoxUC&pg=PA323|accessdate=November 25, 2018 |date=April 26, 2013 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-135-11257-8 |pages=323\u2013 }}</ref> This is the house where they would break up in 1963.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jazzwax.com/2009/06/john-coltrane-naima.html |title=John Coltrane: Naima |website=JazzWax.com|date=June 15, 2009 |accessdate=January 16, 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170121195221/http://www.jazzwax.com/2009/06/john-coltrane-naima.html |archivedate=January 21, 2017}}</ref>\n\nAbout the break up, Naima said in J. C. Thomas's ''Chasin' the Trane'', \"I could feel it was going to happen sooner or later, so I wasn't really surprised when John moved out of the house in the summer of 1963. He didn't offer any explanation. He just told me there were things he had to do, and he left only with his clothes and his horns. He stayed in a hotel sometimes, other times with his mother in Philadelphia. All he said was, 'Naima, I'm going to make a change.' Even though I could feel it coming, it hurt, and I didn't get over it for at least another year.\" But Coltrane kept a close relationship with Naima, even calling her in 1964 to tell her that 90% of his playing would be prayer. They remained in touch until his death in 1967. Naima Coltrane died of a heart attack in October 1996.\n\nIn 1957, Coltrane had a religious experience that may have helped him overcome the heroin addiction<ref>Porter, p. 61</ref><ref name=\"Lavezzoli271\">Lavezzoli, p. 271</ref> and alcoholism<ref name=\"Lavezzoli271\"/> he had struggled with since 1948.<ref>Lavezzoli, pp. 272\u2013273</ref> In the liner notes of ''A Love Supreme'', Coltrane states that in 1957 he experienced \"by the grace of God, a spiritual awakening which was to lead me to a richer, fuller, more productive life. At that time, in gratitude, I humbly asked to be given the means and privilege to make others happy through music.\" The liner notes appear to mention God in a [[Universalism|Universalist]] sense and do not advocate one religion over another.<ref>[http://www.jindustry.com/xtra/coltrane/html/saintjohn.html John Coltrane's liner notes to ''A Love Supreme'', December 1964] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608155911/http://www.jindustry.com/xtra/coltrane/html/saintjohn.html |date=June 8, 2011 }}</ref> Further evidence of this universal view can be found in the liner notes of ''Meditations'' (1965) in which Coltrane declares, \"I believe in all religions.\"<ref name=\"Lavezzoli286\">Lavezzoli, p. 286</ref>\n\nIn 1963, he met pianist [[Alice Coltrane|Alice McLeod]].<ref name=\"Lavezzoli281\">Lavezzoli, p. 281</ref> He and Alice moved in together and had two sons before he became \"officially divorced from Naima in 1966, at which time [he] and Alice were immediately married.\"<ref name=\"Lavezzoli286\"/> John Jr. was born in 1964, Ravi in 1965, and Oranyan (\"Oran\") in 1967.<ref name=\"Lavezzoli286\"/> According to the musician Peter Lavezzoli, \"Alice brought happiness and stability to John's life, not only because they had children, but also because they shared many of the same spiritual beliefs, particularly a mutual interest in Indian philosophy.

The last of these describes, in Lavezzoli's words, a \"search for universal truth, a journey that Coltrane had also undertaken. Yogananda believed that both Eastern and Western spiritual paths were efficacious, and wrote of the similarities between [[Krishna]] and Christ. This openness to different traditions resonated with Coltrane, who studied the [[Qur'an]], the [[Bible]], [[Kabbalah]], and [[astrology]] with equal sincerity.\"<ref>Lavezzoli, pp. 280\u2013281</ref> He also explored [[Hinduism]], [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], [[African history]], the philosophical teachings of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]],<ref>{{cite web |title= John Coltrane, \"A Love Supreme\" and GOD |author= Emmett G.

Coltrane described ''Om'' as the \"first syllable, the primal word, the word of power\".<ref>Porter, p. 265</ref> The 29-minute recording contains chants from the Hindu ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]''<ref>Lavezzoli, p. 285: \"Coltrane and one or two other musicians begin and end the piece by chanting in unison a verse from chapter nine (\"The Yoga of Mysticism\") of the ''Bhagavad Gita'': Rites that the [[Vedas]] ordain, and the rituals taught by the scriptures: all these I am, and the offering made to the ghosts of the fathers, herbs of healing and food, the mantram, the clarified butter. I the [[oblation]], and I the flame into which it is offered. I am the sire of the world, and this world's mother and grandsire. I am he who awards to each the fruit of his action. I make all things clean. I am ''Om!''\"</ref> and the Buddhist ''[[Tibetan Book of the Dead]]'',<ref>Nisenson, p. 183</ref> and a recitation of a passage describing the primal verbalization \"om\" as a cosmic/spiritual common denominator in all things.\n\nColtrane's spiritual journey was interwoven with his investigation of world music. He believed in not only a universal musical structure that transcended ethnic distinctions, but also being able to harness the mystical language of music itself. His study of Indian music led him to believe that certain sounds and scales could \"produce specific emotional meanings.\" According to Coltrane, the goal of a musician was to understand these forces, control them, and elicit a response from the audience. He said, \"I would like to bring to people something like happiness. I would like to discover a method so that if I want it to rain, it will start right away to rain. If one of my friends is ill, I'd like to play a certain song and he will be cured; when he'd be broke, I'd bring out a different song and immediately he'd receive all the money he needed.\"<ref>Porter, p. 211</ref>\n\n== Veneration ==\n{{Infobox saint\n| name = Saint John William Coltrane\n| image = JohnColtraneWiki.jpg\n| caption = Coltrane icon at St. John Coltrane African Orthodox Church\n| birth_date = {{birth date|mf=yes|1926|9|23}}\n| birth_place = Hamlet, North Carolina, US\n| death_date = {{death date and age |1967|07|17|1926|09|23}}\n| death_place = Huntington, New York, US\n| venerated_in = [[African Orthodox Church]]\n| patronage = All Artists\n}}\n\n{{URL|1=http://articles.sfgate.com/1998-06-16/music/17722625_1_saint-john-coltrane-patron-saint-black-jesus|2=Information about Coltrane's canonization}}\n\n\nAfter Coltrane's death, a congregation called the Yardbird Temple in [[San Francisco]] began worshiping him as God incarnate.<ref name=\"Sunday\">{{cite news |last=Freedman |first=Samuel G. |title=Sunday religion, inspired by Saturday nights |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/01/us/01religion.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=November 25, 2018 |date=December 1, 2007}}</ref> The group was named after Charlie Parker, whom they equated to [[John the Baptist]].<ref name=\"Sunday\" /> The congregation became affiliated with the [[African Orthodox Church]]; this involved changing Coltrane's status from a god to a saint.<ref name=\"Sunday\" /> The resultant St.&nbsp;John Coltrane African Orthodox Church, San Francisco, is the only African Orthodox church that incorporates Coltrane's music and his lyrics as prayers in its liturgy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://elvispelvis.com/jazzchurch.htm |title=The Jazz Church |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060812213403/http://elvispelvis.com/jazzchurch.htm |archive-date=August 12, 2006 |first=Gordon |last=Polatnick |website=www.elvispelvis.com}}</ref>\n\nSamuel G.

He led at least fifty recording sessions  and appeared on many albums by other musicians, including trumpeter [[Miles Davis]] and pianist [[Thelonious Monk]]. Over the course of his career, Coltrane's music took on an increasingly spiritual dimension. He remains one of the most influential saxophonists in music history.

In a ''DownBeat'' magazine article in 1960 he recalled, \"the first time I heard Bird play, it hit me right between the eyes.\" Parker became an idol, and they played together occasionally in the late 1940s.

The trumpeter, whose success during the late forties had been followed by several years of decline in activity and reputation, due in part to his struggles with [[heroin]], was again active and about to form a quintet. Coltrane was with this edition of the Davis band (known as the \"First Great Quintet\"\u2014along with [[Red Garland]] on piano, [[Paul Chambers]] on bass, and [[Philly Joe Jones]] on drums) from October 1955 to April 1957 (with a few absences). During this period Davis released several influential recordings that revealed the first signs of Coltrane's growing ability. This quintet, represented by two marathon recording sessions for [[Prestige Records|Prestige]] in 1956, resulted in the albums ''[[Cookin' with The Miles Davis Quintet|Cookin'<nowiki/>]]'', ''[[Relaxin' with The Miles Davis Quintet|Relaxin'<nowiki/>]]'', ''[[Workin' with The Miles Davis Quintet|Workin']]'', and ''[[Steamin' with The Miles Davis Quintet|Steamin']]''. The \"First Great Quintet\" disbanded due in part to Coltrane's heroin addiction.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/07/movies/critic-s-notebook-the-miracle-of-coltrane-dead-at-40-still-vital-at-75.html|title=CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK; The Miracle of Coltrane: Dead at 40, Still Vital at 75|first=Ben|last=Ratliff|date=December 7, 2001|accessdate=March 29, 2019|website=Nytimes.com}}</ref>\n\nDuring the later part of 1957 Coltrane worked with [[Thelonious Monk]] at New York's [[Five Spot Caf\u00e9]], and played in Monk's quartet (July\u2013December 1957), but, owing to contractual conflicts, took part in only one official studio recording session with this group. Coltrane recorded many albums for Prestige under his own name at this time, but Monk refused to record for his old label.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blackthen.com/john-coltrane-legendary-revolutionary-saxophonist-history-jazz-music/|title=John Coltrane: Legendary and Revolutionary Saxophonist in the History of Jazz Music|website=Blackthen.com|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> A private recording made by Juanita Naima Coltrane of a 1958 reunion of the group was issued by Blue Note Records as ''Live at the Five Spot\u2014Discovery!'' in 1993. A high quality tape of a concert given by this quartet in November 1957 was also found later, and was released by Blue Note in 2005. Recorded by [[Voice of America]], the performances confirm the group's reputation, and the resulting album, ''[[Thelonious Monk Quartet with John Coltrane at Carnegie Hall]]'', is widely acclaimed.\n\n''[[Blue Train (album)|Blue Train]]'', Coltrane's sole date as leader for Blue Note, featuring trumpeter [[Lee Morgan]], bassist [[Paul Chambers]], and trombonist [[Curtis Fuller]], is often considered his best album from this period. Four of its five tracks are original Coltrane compositions, and the title track, \"Moment's Notice\", and \"[[Lazy Bird]]\", have become standards. Both tunes employed the first examples of his chord substitution cycles known as [[Coltrane changes]].\n\n===1958: Davis and Coltrane===\nColtrane rejoined Davis in January 1958. In October of that year, jazz critic [[Ira Gitler]] coined the term \"[[sheets of sound]]\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.allaboutjazz.com/john-coltrane-sheets-of-sound.php|title=Jazz news: John Coltrane: Sheets of Sound|website=News.allaboutjazz.com|accessdate=October 15, 2019}}</ref> to describe the style Coltrane developed with Monk and was perfecting in Davis's group, now a sextet. His playing was compressed, with rapid runs cascading in hundreds of notes per minute. He stayed with Davis until April 1960, working with alto saxophonist [[Cannonball Adderley]]; pianists [[Red Garland]], [[Bill Evans]], and [[Wynton Kelly]]; bassist [[Paul Chambers]]; and drummers [[Philly Joe Jones]] and [[Jimmy Cobb]]. During this time he participated in the Davis sessions ''[[Milestones (Miles Davis album)|Milestones]]'' and ''[[Kind of Blue]]'', and the concert recordings ''[[Miles & Monk at Newport]]'' (1963) and ''[[Jazz at the Plaza Vol. I|Jazz at the Plaza]] (1958)''.\n\n===1959\u20131961: Period with Atlantic Records===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2018}}\nAt the end of this period Coltrane recorded ''[[Giant Steps]]'' (1959), his first album as leader for [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]] which contained only his compositions. The album's title track is generally considered to have one of the most difficult chord progressions of any widely played jazz composition. ''Giant Steps'' uses [[Coltrane changes]]. His development of these altered chord progression cycles led to further experimentation with improvised melody and harmony that he continued throughout his career.\n{| border=\"0\"  style=\"float:right; font-size:100%; color:black; width:130px;\"\n|\n{{Listen|pos = right\n |filename = Giant Steps.ogg\n |title = 'Giant Steps'\n |description = One of Coltrane's most acclaimed recordings, \"Giant Steps\" features harmonic structures more complex than were used by most musicians of the time.\n}}\n|}\n\nColtrane formed his first quartet for live performances in 1960 for an appearance at the Jazz Gallery in New York City. After moving through different personnel, including [[Steve Kuhn]], [[Pete La Roca]], and [[Billy Higgins]], he kept pianist [[McCoy Tyner]], bassist [[Steve Davis (bassist)|Steve Davis]], and drummer [[Elvin Jones]]. Tyner, a native of Philadelphia, had been a friend of Coltrane for some years, and the two men had an understanding that Tyner would join the band when he felt ready. ''[[My Favorite Things (John Coltrane album)|My Favorite Things]]'' (1961) was the first album recorded by this band. It was Coltrane's first album on [[soprano saxophone]], which he began playing with Miles Davis. It was considered an unconventional move because the instrument was not as popular in jazz as other types of saxophone.\n\n===1961\u20131962: First years with Impulse Records===\n[[File:JohnColtrane1961.jpg|left|thumb|Coltrane in Amsterdam, 1961)]]\n\nIn May 1961, Coltrane's contract with Atlantic was bought by [[Impulse!

He recorded most of his albums for Impulse! at Van Gelder's studio in [[Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey]].\n\nBy early 1961, bassist Davis had been replaced by [[Reggie Workman]], while [[Eric Dolphy]] joined the group as a second horn. The quintet had a celebrated and extensively recorded residency at the [[Village Vanguard]], which demonstrated Coltrane's new direction. It included the most experimental music he had played, influenced by Indian [[ragas]], [[modal jazz]], and [[free jazz]]. [[John Gilmore (musician)|John Gilmore]], a longtime saxophonist with musician [[Sun Ra]], was particularly influential; after hearing a Gilmore performance, Coltrane is reported to have said, \"He's got it! Gilmore's got the concept!\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Corbett |first=John |title=John Gilmore: The Hard Bop Homepage |journal=[[Down Beat]]}}</ref> The most celebrated of the Vanguard tunes, the 15-minute blues \"Chasin' the 'Trane\", was strongly inspired by Gilmore's music.<ref name=\"kofsky\">{{cite book |first=Frank |last=Kofsky |title=Black Nationalism and the Revolution in Music: John Coltrane: An Interview |publisher=Pathfinder Press |year=1970 |page=235 }}</ref>\n\nDuring this period, critics were divided in their estimation of Coltrane, who had radically altered his style. Audiences, too, were perplexed; in France he was booed during his final tour with Davis. In 1961, ''Down Beat'' magazine called Coltrane and Dolphy players of \"anti-jazz\" in an article that bewildered and upset the musicians.<ref name=\"kofsky\" /> Coltrane admitted some of his early solos were based mostly on technical ideas. Furthermore, Dolphy's angular, voice-like playing earned him a reputation as a figurehead of the \"New Thing\", also known as free jazz, a movement led by [[Ornette Coleman]] which was denigrated by some jazz musicians (including Davis) and critics. But as Coltrane's style developed, he was determined to make every performance \"a whole expression of one's being\".<ref>Nisenson, p. 179</ref>\n\n===1962\u20131965: Classic Quartet period===\n{{Listen|pos = right\n |filename = In a Sentimental Mood sample.ogg\n |title = 'In a Sentimental Mood'\n |description = The romantic ballad features Coltrane with pianist Duke Ellington.\n}}\nIn 1962, Dolphy departed and [[Jimmy Garrison]] replaced Workman as bassist. From then on, the \"Classic Quartet\", as it came to be known, with Tyner, Garrison, and Jones, produced searching, spiritually driven work. Coltrane was moving toward a more harmonically static style that allowed him to expand his improvisations rhythmically, melodically, and motivically. Harmonically complex music was still present, but on stage Coltrane heavily favored continually reworking his \"standards\": \"Impressions\", \"My Favorite Things\", and \"I Want to Talk About You\".\n\nThe criticism of the quintet with Dolphy may have affected Coltrane. In contrast to the radicalism of his 1961 recordings at the Village Vanguard, his studio albums in the following two years (with the exception of ''[[Coltrane (1962 album)|Coltrane]]'', 1962, which featured a blistering version of [[Harold Arlen]]'s \"Out of This World\") were much more conservative. He recorded an album of ballads and participated in album collaborations with [[Duke Ellington and John Coltrane|Duke Ellington]] and singer [[John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman|Johnny Hartman]], a baritone who specialized in ballads. The album ''[[Ballads (John Coltrane album)|Ballads]]'' (recorded 1961\u201362) is emblematic of Coltrane's versatility, as the quartet shed new light on old-fashioned standards such as \"It's Easy to Remember\". Despite a more polished approach in the studio, in concert the quartet continued to balance \"standards\" and its own more exploratory and challenging music, as can be heard on the ''[[Impressions (John Coltrane album)|Impressions]]'' (recorded 1961\u201363), ''[[Live at Birdland (1964 John Coltrane album)|Live at Birdland]]'' and ''[[Newport '63]]'' (both recorded 1963). ''Impressions'' consists of two extended jams including the title track along with \"Dear Old Stockholm\", \"After the Rain\" and a blues. Coltrane later said he enjoyed having a \"balanced catalogue.\"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nNZQCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT192&lpg=PT192&dq=%22Coltrane+later+said+he+enjoyed+having+a+%22balanced+catalogue.%22%22#v=onepage&q=%22Coltrane+later+said+he+enjoyed+having+a+%22balanced+catalogue.%22%22&f=false|title=The History of Jazz and the Jazz Musicians|date=March 13, 2013|publisher=Lulu Press, Inc|accessdate=March 29, 2019|via=Google Books|isbn=9781257544486}}</ref>\n\nOn March 6, 1963, the group entered [[Van Gelder Studio]] in New Jersey and recorded a session that was lost for decades after its master tape was destroyed by Impulse Records to cut down on storage space.

A culmination of much of Coltrane's work up to this point, this four-part suite is an ode to his faith in and love for God. These spiritual concerns characterized much of Coltrane's composing and playing from this point onwards\u2014as can be seen from album titles such as ''Ascension'', ''Om'' and ''Meditations''. The fourth movement of ''A Love Supreme'', \"Psalm\", is, in fact, a musical setting for an original poem to God written by Coltrane, and printed in the album's liner notes. Coltrane plays almost exactly one note for each syllable of the poem, and bases his phrasing on the words. The album was composed at [[John Coltrane Home|Coltrane's home]] in [[Dix Hills, New York|Dix Hills]] on Long Island.\n\nThe quartet played ''A Love Supreme'' live only once\u2014in July 1965 at a concert in [[Antibes]], France.\n<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jazzwisemagazine.com/breaking-news/13655-50th-anniversary-of-coltrane-s-a-love-supreme-celebrated-by-gary-crosby-quartet-southbank |title=50th anniversary of Coltrane's A Love Supreme celebrated by Gary Crosby Quartet at Southbank |last=Flynn |first=Mike|website=Jazzwisemagazine.com|access-date=July 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===1965: Avant-garde jazz and the second quartet===\n[[File:PharoahSanders.jpg|thumb|right|As Coltrane's interest in jazz became experimental, he added Pharoah Sanders (center; circa 1978) to his ensemble.]]\nIn his late period, Coltrane showed an interest in the [[avant-garde jazz]] of Ornette Coleman,<ref>{{cite web|last=Richardson|first=Mark|title=New York Is Killing Me: Albert Ayler\u2019s Life and Death in the Jazz Capital|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/from-the-pitchfork-review/9857-new-york-is-killing-me-albert-aylers-life-and-death-in-the-jazz-capital/|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=April 28, 2016|accessdate=January 16, 2020}}</ref> [[Albert Ayler]],<ref name=\"beta\">{{cite web|last=Beta|first=Andy|title=Astral Traveling: The Ecstasy of Spiritual Jazz|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/pitchfork-essentials/9724-astral-traveling-the-ecstasy-of-spiritual-jazz/|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=September 25, 2015|accessdate=January 16, 2020}}</ref> and Sun Ra.

A series of recordings with the Classic Quartet in the first half of 1965 show Coltrane's playing becoming abstract, with greater incorporation of devices like [[multiphonics]], use of overtones, and playing in the [[altissimo]] register, as well as a mutated return of Coltrane's sheets of sound. In the studio, he all but abandoned soprano saxophone to concentrate on tenor. The quartet responded by playing with increasing freedom. The group's evolution can be traced through the albums ''[[The John Coltrane Quartet Plays]]'', ''[[Living Space (album)|Living Space]]'', ''[[Transition (John Coltrane album)|Transition]]'', ''[[New Thing at Newport]]'', ''[[Sun Ship]]'', and ''[[First Meditations]]''.\n\nIn June 1965, he went into Van Gelder's studio with ten other musicians (including Shepp,<ref name=\"aceves\">{{cite web|last=Aceves|first=Rusty|title=A Look Back At John Coltrane's Ascension|url=https://www.sfjazz.org/onthecorner/look-back-john-coltranes-ascension|work=[[SFJAZZ Center]]|date=January 27, 2017|accessdate=January 16, 2020}}</ref> [[Pharoah Sanders]],<ref name=\"aceves\"/> [[Freddie Hubbard]],<ref name=\"aceves\"/> [[Marion Brown]], and [[John Tchicai]]<ref name=\"aceves\"/>) to record ''[[Ascension (John Coltrane album)|Ascension]]'', a 38-minute piece that included solos by young avant-garde musicians.<ref name=\"bray\"/> The album was controversial primarily for the collective improvisation sections that separated the solos. After recording with the quartet over the next few months, Coltrane invited Sanders to join the band in September 1965. While Coltrane frequently used over-blowing as an emotional exclamation-point, Sanders would overblow entire solos, resulting in a constant screaming and screeching in the [[altissimo]] range of the instrument.\n\n===1965\u20131967: Adding to the quartet===\n[[File:Rashied Ali.jpg|thumb|Percussionist Rashied Ali (pictured in 2007) augmented Coltrane's sound.]]\n\nBy late 1965, Coltrane was regularly augmenting his group with Sanders and other free jazz musicians. [[Rashied Ali]] joined the group as a second drummer. This was the end of the quartet. Claiming he was unable to hear himself over the two drummers, Tyner left the band shortly after the recording of ''[[Meditations (John Coltrane album)|Meditations]]''. Jones left in early 1966, dissatisfied by sharing drumming duties with Ali. After Coltrane's death, Tyner and Jones  in interviews expressed displeasure with the music's direction, while incorporating some of the free-jazz form's intensity in their solo work.\n\nThere is speculation that in 1965 Coltrane began using [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]],<ref>Porter, pp. 265\u2013266.</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=John Coltrane: Divine Wind|journal=The Wire |date=January 30, 2008 |first=Howard |last=Mandel |issue=221 |url=http://www.thewire.co.uk/articles/539/?pageno=5|accessdate=June 29, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929010714/http://www.thewire.co.uk/articles/539/?pageno=5|archivedate=September 29, 2009}}</ref> informing the \"cosmic\" transcendence of his late period. After the departure of Tyner and Jones, Coltrane led a quintet with Sanders on tenor saxophone, his second wife [[Alice Coltrane]] on piano, Garrison on bass, and Ali on drums. Coltrane and Sanders were described by [[Nat Hentoff]] as \"[[glossolalia|speaking in tongues]]\". When touring, the group was known for playing long versions of their repertoire, many stretching beyond 30 minutes to an hour. In concert, solos by band members often extended beyond fifteen minutes.\n\nThe group can be heard on several concert recordings from 1966, including ''[[Live at the Village Vanguard Again!]]'' and ''[[Live in Japan (John Coltrane album)|Live in Japan]]''. In 1967, Coltrane entered the studio several times. Although pieces with Sanders have surfaced (the unusual \"To Be\" has both men on flute), most of the recordings were either with the quartet minus Sanders (''[[Expression (album)|Expression]]'' and ''[[Stellar Regions]]'') or as a duo with Ali. The latter duo produced six performances that appear on the album ''[[Interstellar Space]]''.\n\n===1967: Death===\nColtrane died of liver cancer at the age of 40 on July 17, 1967, at [[North Shore LIJ Health System#Hospitals|Huntington Hospital]] on Long Island. His funeral was held four days later at St. Peter's Lutheran Church in New York City. The service was started by the Albert Ayler Quartet and finished by the Ornette Coleman Quartet. Coltrane is buried at Pinelawn Cemetery in Farmingdale, New York.\n\nBiographer Lewis Porter suggested that the cause of Coltrane's illness was hepatitis, although he also attributed the disease to Coltrane's heroin use.<ref>Porter, p. 292</ref> Coltrane's death surprised many in the music community who were unaware of his condition. Miles Davis said, \"Coltrane's death shocked everyone, took everyone by surprise. I knew he hadn't looked too good... But I didn't know he was that sick\u2014or even sick at all.\"<ref>Porter, p. 290</ref>\n\n==Instruments==\nIn 1947, when he joined [[King Kolax]]'s band, Coltrane switched to tenor saxophone, the instrument he became known for playing.<ref name=\"Ruhlmann\">{{cite web |last1=Ruhlmann |first1=William |title=John Coltrane |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/john-coltrane-mn0000175553/biography |website=AllMusic |accessdate=November 25, 2018}}</ref> In the early 1960s, during his engagement with Atlantic, he played soprano saxophone.<ref name=\"Ruhlmann\" />\n\nHis preference for playing melody higher on the range of the tenor saxophone is attributed to his  training on alto horn and clarinet.

He would often have a spare drum set on concert stages that he would play. His interest in the drums and his penchant for having solos with the drums resonated on tracks such as \"Pursuance\" and \"The Drum Thing\" from ''[[A Love Supreme]]'' and ''[[Crescent (John Coltrane album)|Crescent]]'', respectively.

He was influenced by religion and spirituality beginning in childhood. His maternal grandfather, the Reverend William Blair, was a minister at an [[African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church]]<ref name=\"Porter5-6\">Porter, pp. 5-6</ref><ref>Lavezzoli, p. 270</ref> in [[High Point, North Carolina]], and his paternal grandfather, the Reverend William H.

Naima Coltrane, a Muslim convert, heavily influenced his spirituality. When they married, she had a five-year-old daughter named Antonia, later named Syeeda. Coltrane adopted Syeeda. He met Naima at the home of bassist Steve Davis in Philadelphia. The love ballad he wrote to honor his wife, \"Naima\", was Coltrane's favorite composition. In 1956 the couple left Philadelphia with their six-year-old daughter in tow and moved to New York City. In August 1957, Coltrane, Naima and Syeeda moved into an apartment on 103rd St. and Amsterdam Ave. in New York.

C. Thomas's ''Chasin' the Trane'', \"I could feel it was going to happen sooner or later, so I wasn't really surprised when John moved out of the house in the summer of 1963. He didn't offer any explanation. He just told me there were things he had to do, and he left only with his clothes and his horns. He stayed in a hotel sometimes, other times with his mother in Philadelphia. All he said was, 'Naima, I'm going to make a change.' Even though I could feel it coming, it hurt, and I didn't get over it for at least another year.\" But Coltrane kept a close relationship with Naima, even calling her in 1964 to tell her that 90% of his playing would be prayer. They remained in touch until his death in 1967. Naima Coltrane died of a heart attack in October 1996.\n\nIn 1957, Coltrane had a religious experience that may have helped him overcome the heroin addiction<ref>Porter, p. 61</ref><ref name=\"Lavezzoli271\">Lavezzoli, p. 271</ref> and alcoholism<ref name=\"Lavezzoli271\"/> he had struggled with since 1948.<ref>Lavezzoli, pp. 272\u2013273</ref> In the liner notes of ''A Love Supreme'', Coltrane states that in 1957 he experienced \"by the grace of God, a spiritual awakening which was to lead me to a richer, fuller, more productive life. At that time, in gratitude, I humbly asked to be given the means and privilege to make others happy through music.\" The liner notes appear to mention God in a [[Universalism|Universalist]] sense and do not advocate one religion over another.<ref>[http://www.jindustry.com/xtra/coltrane/html/saintjohn.html John Coltrane's liner notes to ''A Love Supreme'', December 1964] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608155911/http://www.jindustry.com/xtra/coltrane/html/saintjohn.html |date=June 8, 2011 }}</ref> Further evidence of this universal view can be found in the liner notes of ''Meditations'' (1965) in which Coltrane declares, \"I believe in all religions.\"<ref name=\"Lavezzoli286\">Lavezzoli, p. 286</ref>\n\nIn 1963, he met pianist [[Alice Coltrane|Alice McLeod]].<ref name=\"Lavezzoli281\">Lavezzoli, p. 281</ref> He and Alice moved in together and had two sons before he became \"officially divorced from Naima in 1966, at which time [he] and Alice were immediately married.\"<ref name=\"Lavezzoli286\"/> John Jr. was born in 1964, Ravi in 1965, and Oranyan (\"Oran\") in 1967.<ref name=\"Lavezzoli286\"/> According to the musician Peter Lavezzoli, \"Alice brought happiness and stability to John's life, not only because they had children, but also because they shared many of the same spiritual beliefs, particularly a mutual interest in Indian philosophy. Alice also understood what it was like to be a professional musician.\"<ref name=\"Lavezzoli286\"/>\n\nAfter ''A Love Supreme'', many of the titles of his songs and albums had spiritual connotations: ''Ascension'', ''Meditations'', ''Om'', ''Selflessness'', \"Amen\", \"Ascent\", \"Attaining\", \"Dear Lord\", \"Prayer and Meditation Suite\", and \"The Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost\".<ref name=\"Lavezzoli286\"/> His collection of books included ''[[The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna]]'', the [[Bhagavad Gita]], and [[Paramahansa Yogananda]]'s ''[[Autobiography of a Yogi]]''. The last of these describes, in Lavezzoli's words, a \"search for universal truth, a journey that Coltrane had also undertaken. Yogananda believed that both Eastern and Western spiritual paths were efficacious, and wrote of the similarities between [[Krishna]] and Christ. This openness to different traditions resonated with Coltrane, who studied the [[Qur'an]], the [[Bible]], [[Kabbalah]], and [[astrology]] with equal sincerity.\"<ref>Lavezzoli, pp. 280\u2013281</ref> He also explored [[Hinduism]], [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], [[African history]], the philosophical teachings of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]],<ref>{{cite web |title= John Coltrane, \"A Love Supreme\" and GOD |author= Emmett G.

Coltrane described ''Om'' as the \"first syllable, the primal word, the word of power\".<ref>Porter, p. 265</ref> The 29-minute recording contains chants from the Hindu ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]''<ref>Lavezzoli, p. 285: \"Coltrane and one or two other musicians begin and end the piece by chanting in unison a verse from chapter nine (\"The Yoga of Mysticism\") of the ''Bhagavad Gita'': Rites that the [[Vedas]] ordain, and the rituals taught by the scriptures: all these I am, and the offering made to the ghosts of the fathers, herbs of healing and food, the mantram, the clarified butter. I the [[oblation]], and I the flame into which it is offered. I am the sire of the world, and this world's mother and grandsire. I am he who awards to each the fruit of his action. I make all things clean. I am ''Om!''\"</ref> and the Buddhist ''[[Tibetan Book of the Dead]]'',<ref>Nisenson, p. 183</ref> and a recitation of a passage describing the primal verbalization \"om\" as a cosmic/spiritual common denominator in all things.\n\nColtrane's spiritual journey was interwoven with his investigation of world music. He believed in not only a universal musical structure that transcended ethnic distinctions, but also being able to harness the mystical language of music itself. His study of Indian music led him to believe that certain sounds and scales could \"produce specific emotional meanings.\" According to Coltrane, the goal of a musician was to understand these forces, control them, and elicit a response from the audience. He said, \"I would like to bring to people something like happiness. I would like to discover a method so that if I want it to rain, it will start right away to rain. If one of my friends is ill, I'd like to play a certain song and he will be cured; when he'd be broke, I'd bring out a different song and immediately he'd receive all the money he needed.\"<ref>Porter, p. 211</ref>\n\n== Veneration ==\n{{Infobox saint\n| name = Saint John William Coltrane\n| image = JohnColtraneWiki.jpg\n| caption = Coltrane icon at St. John Coltrane African Orthodox Church\n| birth_date = {{birth date|mf=yes|1926|9|23}}\n| birth_place = Hamlet, North Carolina, US\n| death_date = {{death date and age |1967|07|17|1926|09|23}}\n| death_place = Huntington, New York, US\n| venerated_in = [[African Orthodox Church]]\n| patronage = All Artists\n}}\n\n{{URL|1=http://articles.sfgate.com/1998-06-16/music/17722625_1_saint-john-coltrane-patron-saint-black-jesus|2=Information about Coltrane's canonization}}\n\n\nAfter Coltrane's death, a congregation called the Yardbird Temple in [[San Francisco]] began worshiping him as God incarnate.<ref name=\"Sunday\">{{cite news |last=Freedman |first=Samuel G. |title=Sunday religion, inspired by Saturday nights |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/01/us/01religion.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=November 25, 2018 |date=December 1, 2007}}</ref> The group was named after Charlie Parker, whom they equated to [[John the Baptist]].<ref name=\"Sunday\" /> The congregation became affiliated with the [[African Orthodox Church]]; this involved changing Coltrane's status from a god to a saint.<ref name=\"Sunday\" /> The resultant St.&nbsp;John Coltrane African Orthodox Church, San Francisco, is the only African Orthodox church that incorporates Coltrane's music and his lyrics as prayers in its liturgy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://elvispelvis.com/jazzchurch.htm |title=The Jazz Church |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060812213403/http://elvispelvis.com/jazzchurch.htm |archive-date=August 12, 2006 |first=Gordon |last=Polatnick |website=www.elvispelvis.com}}</ref>\n\nSamuel G.

The tournament was inspired by [[Premier League Darts]], which is organized by the professional darts organisation, [[Professional Darts Corporation|PDC]]. The idea to play this tournament was created during the world-wide pandemic of [[COVID-19|Covid-19]]. The meaning of the competition is, apart from the fight against the coronavirus, also an introduction of more Czech players to the general public. For players it is a great opportunity to practice and compete during this hard time and to gain much needed experience for future years of their careers.<ref>https://isport.blesk.cz/clanek/ostatni-dalsi-sporty-sipky/377640/sipky-i-v-dobe-koronaviru-startuje-ceska-obdoba-premier-league.html</ref>\n\n== Format ==\nThe format of the tournament is very similar to Premier League Darts, which is organised by the [[Professional Darts Corporation|PDC]]. The main difference is the absence of a draw, each match has a winner and a loser. Each match starts with a [[bullseye (target)|bulls-eye]] shootout, which decides who will start the match. The first player to throw on the bulls-eye is the one that is listed as the first in the schedule. Values of the shootout are: 50 - the red middle; 25 - the green middle; outside. If both players score the same value, the shootout continues in the reversed order until the decision.\n\n'''Phase 1:'''  In the first phase of the competition (9 rounds), ten players play each other. Phase 1 matches have a maximum of eleven legs, allowing for the winner being first to six. At the end of Phase 1, the two bottom players are eliminated from the competition.\n\n'''Phase 2:''' In the second phase of the competition (7 rounds), eight remaining players play again each other. Phase 2 matches have a maximum of thirteen legs, allowing for the winner being first to seven. At the end of Phase 2, the bottom four players in the league table are eliminated from the competition. The first four players in the league table qualify for the Play-off.\n\n'''Play-off:''' The top four players in the league table contest the two knockout semi-finals with 1st playing 4th and 2nd playing 3rd. The semi-finals are first to 10 legs (best of 19). The two winning semi-finalists meet in the final which is also best of 19.\n\n== Venues ==\nDue to the [[coronavirus outbreak]] and regulations from the government of the [[Czech Republic]], all players will play from their home. All players have a [[webcam]] prepared in their home environment, through which it is possible to watch every thrown dart. After each throw, players announce their score. Viewers see both [[dartboard]]s at the same time, along with the scoreboard which is powered by [[DartConnect]].\n\n{{Location map+ | Czechia\n| width=700\n| caption=Map of player's locations\n| float=left\n| places =\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Fulnek\n    | lat_deg = 49.71\n    | lon_deg = 17.90 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Zderaz\n    | position=bottom\n    | lat_deg = 49.82\n    | lon_deg = 16.10 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = \u00davaly\n    | lat_deg = 50.07\n    | lon_deg = 14.73 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Prague\n    | position=left\n    | lat_deg = 50.08\n    | lon_deg = 14.41 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9\n    | lat_deg = 50.21\n    | lon_deg = 15.83 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = \u00dasobrno\n    | lat_deg = 49.59\n    | lon_deg = 16.78 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Bouzov\n    | position=left\n    | lat_deg = 49.70\n    | lon_deg = 16.89 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Po\u0159\u00ed\u010d\u00ed u Litomy\u0161le\n    | position=top\n    | lat_deg = 49.80\n    | lon_deg = 16.19 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Uni\u010dov\n    | position=top\n    | lat_deg = 49.77\n    | lon_deg = 17.12 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = N\u00e1vs\u00ed\n    | lat_deg = 49.58\n    | lon_deg = 18.76 }}\n}}\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br><br><br><br>\n<br><br><br><br>\n<br><br><br><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n== Prize money ==\nThe first edition of the tournament does not include any prize money for players.

The tournament was inspired by [[Premier League Darts]], which is organized by the professional darts organisation, [[Professional Darts Corporation|PDC]]. The idea to play this tournament was created during the world-wide pandemic of [[COVID-19|Covid-19]]. The meaning of the competition is, apart from the fight against the coronavirus, also an introduction of more Czech players to the general public. For players it is a great opportunity to practice and compete during this hard time and to gain much needed experience for future years of their careers.<ref>https://isport.blesk.cz/clanek/ostatni-dalsi-sporty-sipky/377640/sipky-i-v-dobe-koronaviru-startuje-ceska-obdoba-premier-league.html</ref>\n\n== Format ==\nThe format of the tournament is very similar to Premier League Darts, which is organised by the [[Professional Darts Corporation|PDC]]. The main difference is the absence of a draw, each match has a winner and a loser. Each match starts with a [[bullseye (target)|bulls-eye]] shootout, which decides who will start the match. The first player to throw on the bulls-eye is the one that is listed as the first in the schedule. Values of the shootout are: 50 - the red middle; 25 - the green middle; outside. If both players score the same value, the shootout continues in the reversed order until the decision.\n\n'''Phase 1:'''  In the first phase of the competition (9 rounds), ten players play each other. Phase 1 matches have a maximum of eleven legs, allowing for the winner being first to six. At the end of Phase 1, the two bottom players are eliminated from the competition.\n\n'''Phase 2:''' In the second phase of the competition (7 rounds), eight remaining players play again each other. Phase 2 matches have a maximum of thirteen legs, allowing for the winner being first to seven. At the end of Phase 2, the bottom four players in the league table are eliminated from the competition. The first four players in the league table qualify for the Play-off.\n\n'''Play-off:''' The top four players in the league table contest the two knockout semi-finals with 1st playing 4th and 2nd playing 3rd. The semi-finals are first to 10 legs (best of 19). The two winning semi-finalists meet in the final which is also best of 19.\n\n== Venues ==\nDue to the [[coronavirus outbreak]] and regulations from the government of the [[Czech Republic]], all players will play from their home. All players have a [[webcam]] prepared in their home environment, through which it is possible to watch every thrown dart. After each throw, players announce their score. Viewers see both [[dartboard]]s at the same time, along with the scoreboard which is powered by [[DartConnect]].\n\n{{Location map+ | Czechia\n| width=700\n| caption=Map of player's locations\n| float=left\n| places =\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Fulnek\n    | lat_deg = 49.71\n    | lon_deg = 17.90 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Zderaz\n    | position=bottom\n    | lat_deg = 49.82\n    | lon_deg = 16.10 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = \u00davaly\n    | lat_deg = 50.07\n    | lon_deg = 14.73 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Prague\n    | position=left\n    | lat_deg = 50.08\n    | lon_deg = 14.41 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9\n    | lat_deg = 50.21\n    | lon_deg = 15.83 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = \u00dasobrno\n    | lat_deg = 49.59\n    | lon_deg = 16.78 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Bouzov\n    | position=left\n    | lat_deg = 49.70\n    | lon_deg = 16.89 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Po\u0159\u00ed\u010d\u00ed u Litomy\u0161le\n    | position=top\n    | lat_deg = 49.80\n    | lon_deg = 16.19 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Uni\u010dov\n    | position=top\n    | lat_deg = 49.77\n    | lon_deg = 17.12 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = N\u00e1vs\u00ed\n    | lat_deg = 49.58\n    | lon_deg = 18.76 }}\n}}\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br><br><br><br>\n<br><br><br><br>\n<br><br><br><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n== Prize money ==\nThe first edition of the tournament does not include any prize money for players.

Other players have experience from international tournaments and are the best players in Czech Republic.

No. EDU-33-13-00022-E.</ref>\n\n===Data collection and assessment===\n\nIn order to improve school performance across the state, NYSED developed a [[Data Warehouse]] for the purposes of [[data reporting|tracking performance data]] connected to state examinations. Each K-12 public school student is assigned a unique 10-digit identifier (NYSSIS)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.p12.nysed.gov/irs/sirs/documentation/nyssisguide.pdf|title=NYSSIS User Guide|accessdate=24 February 2011 |work=NYSED web site}}</ref> which is captured in the SIRS database (NYS Student Information Repository System) for the purposes of data assessment in connection with state examinations and school report card analysis from state to the local level. The state's Education Data Portal partners with [[inBloom]] to integrate student data.<ref>EngageNY Portal Privacy Parent FAQ, NYSED Race to the Top http://usny.nysed.gov/rttt/data/edp-privacy-parent-faq.html</ref>\n\nAs student test results are analyzed and checked for accuracy the Data Warehouse system allows for certain data characteristics to be collected and processed for further school improvement and decision making at the local as well as statewide level.\n\n* Level 0 (regional) represents the regional or local level where individual schools, at the district level, input state assessment results and check for accuracy in data reporting (for example, School district level). Schools often use software utilities and online analytical tools to make school improvement decisions and examine changes in overall curriculum planning at a district wide level.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://datacentral.esboces.org/docs/20-2010-11%20esbric%20sds%20service%20guide.pdf|title=Eastern Suffolk BOCES Service Guide 2010-2011|accessdate=24 February 2011|work=Eastern Suffolk BOCES web site|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726034208/http://datacentral.esboces.org/docs/20-2010-11%20esbric%20sds%20service%20guide.pdf|archivedate=26 July 2011}}</ref>\n* Level 1 (regional) represents a second regional or local level where data is placed after Level 0 data has been submitted for aggregate processing. For example, [[Board of Cooperative Educational Services#List of Regional Information Centers .28RICs.29|New York State BOCES Regional Information Center (RIC)]] or large city level.\n* Level 1C (regional) represents repository data ready for migration to the state repository level\n* Level 2 (statewide) represents a statewide repository where data is moved. Includes name and unique identifier for comparative and independent school performance and analysis.\n* Level 3 (statewide) represents locked assessment data used for state use, such as school report cards and decisions involving accountability. For privacy reasons, no names are used and unique identifiers are encrypted.\n\nMany districts throughout the state have been advised to develop both Data Administrator or Chief Information Officer positions as well as Data Committees to examine the validity and accuracy of submissions to various levels of the data warehouse.\n\n===School report cards===\nWith much recent focus on school accountability, New York State Education Department uses a systematic approach to determining how tests and other assessment data can be reported to local schools and the communities they support.\n\n===Accountability===\nSchools who fall short of reaching state standards are given a state designation of [http://www.p12.nysed.gov/accountability/APA/SURR/SURR_home.html SURR] (Schools Under Registration Review) and have only two years to turn around their rating according to the accountability division of NYSED. Each year, the Commissioner publishes a report highlighting which schools have been taken off the list and which schools have been added.\n\n==Teaching license requirements==\nIn order to teach in New York, the applicant must hold a valid New York State Teaching License. Most new certified teachers come from state-accredited teaching programs in [[college]]s or [[university|universities]] either in New York or another state that has a reciprocal agreement with New York. Prior to initial certification, prospective teachers must pass:\n\n*the Educating All Students Test (EAS)\n*a Content Specialty Test (CST) appropriate to the subject the applicant wishes to teach.\n*Pearson's edTPA Portfolio assessment system\n\nThis initial teacher certification is temporary and expires after five years. Candidates may expect to pay, as of 2014, up to eight hundred dollars for certification tests and requirements.\n\nTo obtain a professional certificate, the applicant must have completed a state-accredited teacher education program at a college/university and hold a master's degree or above, and must have completed three years of full-time teaching experience. New York no longer offers ''permanent'' certification to those who were not certified prior to February 2004. To maintain a professional certificate, a teacher must complete 100 hours of professional development every five years. These professional development hours are decreased by a few percentages for every year teaching in a non-public school. One does not have to teach in New York State to maintain their certificate as many New York certified teachers teach in Connecticut and New Jersey.\n\n===Foreign teachers and career changers===\nCareer changers and others who did not graduate from a teacher education program can earn a teaching certificate by completing the above-mentioned tests, completing satisfactory education coursework in college, and finally apply for a license for teaching with the ''NYSED Office of Teaching Initiatives.'' Some new teachers have college degrees in an academic field (e.g. [[English studies|English]] or [[history]] but do not have a teaching certificate. If they wish to enter teaching, they must have a [[Bachelor's degree|baccalaureate]] degree with a satisfactory [[GPA]], take all of the above-mentioned tests, and apply for a license with the Office of Teaching Initiatives.\n\nPrograms such as the [[New York City Teaching Fellows]] allow uncertified teachers to teach under a transitional license, provided that they have received a bachelor's degree, passed the LAST and the CST in their area, and are enrolled in a cooperating master's degree program.  Teachers with a Transitional B license have three years to apply for their Initial Certification, which requires completion of student teaching, education coursework, subject-area coursework, and the ATS-W exam.\n\n===Teachers from another state===\nApplicants who hold a certificate from another state, or who have completed an approved program that would lead to a teaching certificate in another state, may be eligible for a New York teaching certificate through interstate reciprocity.<ref>{{cite web|title=Applicants from Other States (Interstate Reciprocity)|url=http://www.highered.nysed.gov/tcert/certificate/teachrecother.html|work=NY Teacher Certification web page|publisher=New York State Education Department|accessdate=22 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Other educational professions===\nThe department also oversees and awards the Pupil Personnel Certificate, which is certification for other professionals who have direct contact with students. This includes the following fields: School Social Worker, School Psychologist, School Counselor, School Attendance Teacher, School Nurse Teacher and School [[dental hygienist|Dental Hygiene]] Teacher.  These certificates are still permanent unless revoked with cause.\n\n===Literacy requirement===\nIn March 2017, the Board of Regents eliminated a literacy test for prospective teachers because, according to the New York Times, \"the test proved controversial because black and Hispanic candidates passed it at significantly lower rates than white candidates.\"<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/13/nyregion/ny-regents-teacher-exams-alst.html?_r=0 Regents Drop Teacher Literacy Test Seen as Discriminatory], New York Times, March 13, 2017</ref>\n\n==Professional licensing==\nIn addition to licensing teachers, the department coordinates licensing for all other professions (except for law) that must receive state licenses, such as [[physician]]s, [[nurse practitioner]]s, [[accountant]]s, and [[social worker]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|New York (state)|Education}}\n*[[Mathematics education in New York]]\n*[[Global Studies]]\n*[[List of school districts in New York]]\n*[[University of the State of New York]]\n*[[New York State Summer School of the Arts]]\n*[[New York City Department of Education]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references />\n\n==References==\n*[http://www.highered.nysed.gov/tcert/certificate/ Certification: Office of Teaching Initiatives]\n*[[DeSales High School (Geneva, New York)|DeSales High School]]'s [http://www.desaleshs.org/PDF_Files/StudentHandbook2006.pdf Student/Parent Handbook]\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n*[http://www.nysed.gov New York State Education Department] (official website)\n*[https://govt.westlaw.com/nycrr/Browse/Home/NewYork/NewYorkCodesRulesandRegulations?guid=I0e0f8c60aab711ddae51f9dc2e7e68c4&originationContext=documenttoc&transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default) Education Department] in the [[New York Codes, Rules and Regulations]]\n{{NewYorkStateExecutiveDepartments}}\n{{K-12 Education agencies in the US}}\n{{coord missing|New York (state)}}\n\n[[Category:New York state government departments|Education]]\n[[Category:Education in New York (state)|Department of Education]]\n[[Category:State departments of education of the United States]]\n[[Category:Standardized tests in the United States]]\n[[Category:New York State Education Department| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{Redirect|New York Department of Education ONLINE \nschool system serving New York City|New York City Department of Education}}\n{{Redirect|NYSED|the umbrella organization for numerous executive agencies of New York state government|New York State Executive Department}}\n{{Infobox government agency\n| agency_name     = Education Department\n| type            = department\n| nativename      = \n| nativename_a    = \n| nativename_r    = \n| logo            = \n| logo_width      = \n| logo_caption    = \n| seal            = \n| seal_width      = \n| seal_caption    = \n| picture         = File:NYSED Building Night 2.JPG\n| picture_width   = \n| picture_caption = The [[New York State Department of Education Building|State Education Building]] in [[Albany, New York|Albany]]\n| formed          = <!-- {{Start date|YYYY|MM|DD}} OR {{Start date and age|YYYY|MM|DD}} -->\n| preceding1      = \n| preceding2      = \n<!-- (etc.) -->\n| dissolved       = \n| superseding     = \n| jurisdiction    = [[New York (state)|New York]]\n| headquarters    = \n| coordinates     = <!--{{coord|LATITUDE|LONGITUDE|type:landmark_region:US|display=inline,title}}-->\n| motto           = \n| employees       = \n| budget          = \n| prime_minister_name  = \n| minister1_name  = \n| minister1_pfo   = \n| minister2_name  = \n| minister2_pfo   = \n<!-- (etc.) -->\n| deputyminister1_name = \n| deputyminister1_pfo  = \n| deputyminister2_name = \n| deputyminister2_pfo  = \n<!-- (etc.) -->\n| chief1_name     = [[Beth Berlin]]\n| chief1_position = [[Interim Commissioner of Education of the State of New York|Interim Commissioner of Education]]\n| chief2_name     = \n| chief2_position = \n<!-- (etc.) -->\n| director_general     = \n| agency_type     = \n| parent_department = \n| parent_agency   = \n| child1_agency   = \n| child2_agency   = \n<!-- (etc.) -->\n| keydocument1    = [[Consolidated Laws of New York|Education Law]]\n<!-- (etc.) -->\n| website         = {{URL|http://www.nysed.gov}}\n| footnotes       = \n| map             = \n| map_width       = \n| map_caption     = \n}}\n{{Education in the U.S.}}\nThe '''New York State Education Department''' ('''NYSED''') is the department of the [[Government of New York (state)|New York state government]]<ref>[[Education Law]] \u00a7 101. \"There shall continue to be in the state government an education department.

Each K-12 public school student is assigned a unique 10-digit identifier (NYSSIS)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.p12.nysed.gov/irs/sirs/documentation/nyssisguide.pdf|title=NYSSIS User Guide|accessdate=24 February 2011 |work=NYSED web site}}</ref> which is captured in the SIRS database (NYS Student Information Repository System) for the purposes of data assessment in connection with state examinations and school report card analysis from state to the local level. The state's Education Data Portal partners with [[inBloom]] to integrate student data.<ref>EngageNY Portal Privacy Parent FAQ, NYSED Race to the Top http://usny.nysed.gov/rttt/data/edp-privacy-parent-faq.html</ref>\n\nAs student test results are analyzed and checked for accuracy the Data Warehouse system allows for certain data characteristics to be collected and processed for further school improvement and decision making at the local as well as statewide level.\n\n* Level 0 (regional) represents the regional or local level where individual schools, at the district level, input state assessment results and check for accuracy in data reporting (for example, School district level). Schools often use software utilities and online analytical tools to make school improvement decisions and examine changes in overall curriculum planning at a district wide level.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://datacentral.esboces.org/docs/20-2010-11%20esbric%20sds%20service%20guide.pdf|title=Eastern Suffolk BOCES Service Guide 2010-2011|accessdate=24 February 2011|work=Eastern Suffolk BOCES web site|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726034208/http://datacentral.esboces.org/docs/20-2010-11%20esbric%20sds%20service%20guide.pdf|archivedate=26 July 2011}}</ref>\n* Level 1 (regional) represents a second regional or local level where data is placed after Level 0 data has been submitted for aggregate processing. For example, [[Board of Cooperative Educational Services#List of Regional Information Centers .28RICs.29|New York State BOCES Regional Information Center (RIC)]] or large city level.\n* Level 1C (regional) represents repository data ready for migration to the state repository level\n* Level 2 (statewide) represents a statewide repository where data is moved. Includes name and unique identifier for comparative and independent school performance and analysis.\n* Level 3 (statewide) represents locked assessment data used for state use, such as school report cards and decisions involving accountability. For privacy reasons, no names are used and unique identifiers are encrypted.\n\nMany districts throughout the state have been advised to develop both Data Administrator or Chief Information Officer positions as well as Data Committees to examine the validity and accuracy of submissions to various levels of the data warehouse.\n\n===School report cards===\nWith much recent focus on school accountability, New York State Education Department uses a systematic approach to determining how tests and other assessment data can be reported to local schools and the communities they support.\n\n===Accountability===\nSchools who fall short of reaching state standards are given a state designation of [http://www.p12.nysed.gov/accountability/APA/SURR/SURR_home.html SURR] (Schools Under Registration Review) and have only two years to turn around their rating according to the accountability division of NYSED. Each year, the Commissioner publishes a report highlighting which schools have been taken off the list and which schools have been added.\n\n==Teaching license requirements==\nIn order to teach in New York, the applicant must hold a valid New York State Teaching License. Most new certified teachers come from state-accredited teaching programs in [[college]]s or [[university|universities]] either in New York or another state that has a reciprocal agreement with New York. Prior to initial certification, prospective teachers must pass:\n\n*the Educating All Students Test (EAS)\n*a Content Specialty Test (CST) appropriate to the subject the applicant wishes to teach.\n*Pearson's edTPA Portfolio assessment system\n\nThis initial teacher certification is temporary and expires after five years. Candidates may expect to pay, as of 2014, up to eight hundred dollars for certification tests and requirements.\n\nTo obtain a professional certificate, the applicant must have completed a state-accredited teacher education program at a college/university and hold a master's degree or above, and must have completed three years of full-time teaching experience. New York no longer offers ''permanent'' certification to those who were not certified prior to February 2004. To maintain a professional certificate, a teacher must complete 100 hours of professional development every five years. These professional development hours are decreased by a few percentages for every year teaching in a non-public school. One does not have to teach in New York State to maintain their certificate as many New York certified teachers teach in Connecticut and New Jersey.\n\n===Foreign teachers and career changers===\nCareer changers and others who did not graduate from a teacher education program can earn a teaching certificate by completing the above-mentioned tests, completing satisfactory education coursework in college, and finally apply for a license for teaching with the ''NYSED Office of Teaching Initiatives.'' Some new teachers have college degrees in an academic field (e.g. [[English studies|English]] or [[history]] but do not have a teaching certificate. If they wish to enter teaching, they must have a [[Bachelor's degree|baccalaureate]] degree with a satisfactory [[GPA]], take all of the above-mentioned tests, and apply for a license with the Office of Teaching Initiatives.\n\nPrograms such as the [[New York City Teaching Fellows]] allow uncertified teachers to teach under a transitional license, provided that they have received a bachelor's degree, passed the LAST and the CST in their area, and are enrolled in a cooperating master's degree program.  Teachers with a Transitional B license have three years to apply for their Initial Certification, which requires completion of student teaching, education coursework, subject-area coursework, and the ATS-W exam.\n\n===Teachers from another state===\nApplicants who hold a certificate from another state, or who have completed an approved program that would lead to a teaching certificate in another state, may be eligible for a New York teaching certificate through interstate reciprocity.<ref>{{cite web|title=Applicants from Other States (Interstate Reciprocity)|url=http://www.highered.nysed.gov/tcert/certificate/teachrecother.html|work=NY Teacher Certification web page|publisher=New York State Education Department|accessdate=22 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Other educational professions===\nThe department also oversees and awards the Pupil Personnel Certificate, which is certification for other professionals who have direct contact with students. This includes the following fields: School Social Worker, School Psychologist, School Counselor, School Attendance Teacher, School Nurse Teacher and School [[dental hygienist|Dental Hygiene]] Teacher.  These certificates are still permanent unless revoked with cause.\n\n===Literacy requirement===\nIn March 2017, the Board of Regents eliminated a literacy test for prospective teachers because, according to the New York Times, \"the test proved controversial because black and Hispanic candidates passed it at significantly lower rates than white candidates.\"<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/13/nyregion/ny-regents-teacher-exams-alst.html?_r=0 Regents Drop Teacher Literacy Test Seen as Discriminatory], New York Times, March 13, 2017</ref>\n\n==Professional licensing==\nIn addition to licensing teachers, the department coordinates licensing for all other professions (except for law) that must receive state licenses, such as [[physician]]s, [[nurse practitioner]]s, [[accountant]]s, and [[social worker]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|New York (state)|Education}}\n*[[Mathematics education in New York]]\n*[[Global Studies]]\n*[[List of school districts in New York]]\n*[[University of the State of New York]]\n*[[New York State Summer School of the Arts]]\n*[[New York City Department of Education]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references />\n\n==References==\n*[http://www.highered.nysed.gov/tcert/certificate/ Certification: Office of Teaching Initiatives]\n*[[DeSales High School (Geneva, New York)|DeSales High School]]'s [http://www.desaleshs.org/PDF_Files/StudentHandbook2006.pdf Student/Parent Handbook]\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n*[http://www.nysed.gov New York State Education Department] (official website)\n*[https://govt.westlaw.com/nycrr/Browse/Home/NewYork/NewYorkCodesRulesandRegulations?guid=I0e0f8c60aab711ddae51f9dc2e7e68c4&originationContext=documenttoc&transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default) Education Department] in the [[New York Codes, Rules and Regulations]]\n{{NewYorkStateExecutiveDepartments}}\n{{K-12 Education agencies in the US}}\n{{coord missing|New York (state)}}\n\n[[Category:New York state government departments|Education]]\n[[Category:Education in New York (state)|Department of Education]]\n[[Category:State departments of education of the United States]]\n[[Category:Standardized tests in the United States]]\n[[Category:New York State Education Department| ]]\n", "name_user": "Captian Perry", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added more Coronavirus updates and fixes to the grammar in that subsection.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Education_Department"}

Its official designation is '''Mitsubishi Navy Type 1 attack bomber''' (\u4e00\u5f0f\u9678\u4e0a\u653b\u6483\u6a5f, \u4e00\u5f0f\u9678\u653b ''Ichishiki rikuj\u014d k\u014dgeki ki, Ichishikirikk\u014d'') and was commonly referred to by Japanese Navy pilots as {{nihongo|''Hamaki''|\u8449\u5dfb|extra=\"cigar\", lit. \"leaf roll\"}} due to the cylindrical shape of its fuselage. The [[World War II Allied names for Japanese aircraft|Allied reporting name]] was \"'''Betty'''\".<ref name=Francillon/>\n\nDesigned to a strict specification to succeed the [[Mitsubishi G3M]] already in service, the G4M boasted very good performance and excellent range and was considered the best land-based naval bomber at the time.<ref name=Francillon/> This was achieved by its structural lightness and an almost total lack of protection for the crew, with no armor plating or [[self-sealing fuel tank]]s.<ref name=murphy-mcnniece>{{cite book |last1=Murphy |first1=Justin D. |last2=McNiece |first2=Mathew A. |title=Military Aircraft, 1919-1945: An Illustrated History of Their Impact |year=1979 |publisher=Putnam & Company Limited |location=London |isbn=1851094989 |pages=150\u2013151}}</ref> The G4M was officially adopted on 2 April 1941 but the aforementioned problems would prove to be a severe drawback, often suffering heavy losses; [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]] pilots nicknamed the G4M \"The Flying Lighter\" as it was extremely prone to ignition after a few hits.<ref name=Francillon/><ref name=\"marting4m\"/><ref name=murphy-mcnniece/> It was not until later variants of the G4M2 and G4M3 that self-sealing fuel tanks, armor protection for the crew and better defensive armament was installed.\n\nNevertheless, the G4M would become the Navy's primary land-based bomber. It is the most widely produced and most famous bomber operated by the Japanese during  World War II and it served in nearly all battles during the [[Pacific War]].<ref name=Francillon/><ref name=murphy-mcnniece/> The aircraft is also known for being the [[mothership]] that carried the [[Yokosuka MXY-7 Ohka]], a purpose-built anti-ship suicide weapon during the final years of the war.<ref name=osamutagaya>{{cite book |last=Tagaya |first=Osamu |title=Mitsubishi Type 1 Rikko \u2018Betty\u2019 Units of World War 2|year=2001 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |location= |isbn=184176082X |pages=90\u201395}}</ref> Of the 2400 G4Ms produced, no intact aircraft have survived.\n\n==Design and development==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}\nThe G4Ms predecessor the [[Mitsubishi G3M]] went into service in 1937 in China.<ref name=Smithsonian>{{cite web |title=Mitsubishi G4M3 Model 34 BETTY |url=https://www.si.edu/object/nasm_A19600336000 |website=Smithsonian Institution |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |accessdate=1 October 2019 |language=en}}</ref>  Only two months later the Japanese Navy issued specifications to Mitsubishi.<ref name=Smithsonian/>  The specifications, unprecedented at the time, called for a twin-engine, land-based, attack bomber with a top speed of {{convert|398|km/h|mph}}, altitude of {{convert|3,000|m|ft}}, and a range of {{convert|4,722|km|mi}} unloaded (with bombs and torpedoes), and a range of {{convert|3,700|km|mi}} when carrying an {{convert|800|kg|lb}} torpedo or the same weight in bombs.<ref name=Smithsonian/>\n\nThe G4M was designed for a long range and high speed at the time of its introduction.  In order to meet the Navy's specifications a Mitsubishi team lead by Kiro Honjo did not incorporate [[self-sealing fuel tanks]] and armor plating to save weight and extend range.<ref name=Smithsonian/> This consequently made both the G4M and the Zero, which Mitsubishi used the same design features, vulnerable to machine gun and cannon fire.<ref name=Smithsonian/>  Consequently, Allied fighter pilots to give it derisive nicknames such as \"the flying lighter\"<ref name=Smithsonian/> \"the one-shot lighter\", \"the flying [[Zippo]]\" and \"the flying cigar\" because of their tendency to ignite from damage to the wing fuel tanks after being hit by gunfire.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} The pilots of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] called the G4M the \"''hamaki''\" (\"cigar\"), however this was due to its shape.<ref name=Smithsonian/>  Due to deficiencies of the G3M in warding off concentrated fighter attacks Honjo incorporated {{convert|7.7| mm|inch|abbr=on}} guns in the nose, on top and both sides of the fuselage and in the tail a {{convert|20|mm|inch|abbr=on}} cannon was added.<ref name=Smithsonian/>\n\n[[File:G4M-49.jpg |thumb|right|A Mitsubishi G4M1; with a non-standard roundel - a white square instead of the white circle surrounding the [[hinomaru]].]]\n\nWhen used for medium- to high-altitude bombing against stationary land targets like supply depots, seaports or airfields, it was much harder to intercept. Using its long range and high speed, the G4M could appear from any direction, and then it could be gone before any fighters intercepted them. The 20&nbsp;mm cannon in its tail turret was much heavier armament than was commonly carried by bombers of either side, making aerial attacks from the rear quite dangerous for the Allied fighter aircraft. Sometimes, assuming they did not catch fire after being hit in the wings by flak from the ground or by machine gun bullets from enemy fighters, G4Ms also proved to be able to remain airborne despite being badly damaged. For example, after the attack of the ''751 [[K\u014dk\u016btai]]'' (air group) on the [[USS Chicago (CA-29)|USS ''Chicago'']] during the [[Battle of Rennell Island]], three out of four surviving aircraft (of the original eleven) returned despite flying with only one engine.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nAs the war continued improved bomber designs failed to materialize and Mitsubishi began creating additional versions to fulfill various news missions as well as eliminate the weakness in the design including various engine and weapon variants.  The G4M2 redesign failed  to shore up the G4Ms vulnerability to weapons fire.<ref name=Smithsonian/>\n\n===First flight===\nThe first G4M prototype left Mitsubishi's Nagoya plant in September 1939 disassembled and loaded in five ox-drawn farm carts to Kagamigahara <!-- Kakamigahara, Gifu?

The G4M Model ''11'' was prominent in attacks on Allied shipping from 1941 to early 1944, but after that it became increasingly easy prey for Allied fighters.\n\nThe G4M was first used in combat on 13 September 1940 in [[Mainland China]], when 27 \"Bettys\" and [[Mitsubishi C5M]]s of 1st ''Rengo [[K\u014dk\u016btai]]'' (a mixed force including elements of the ''Kanoya'' and ''Kizarazu'' ''[[K\u014dk\u016btai]]'') departed from [[Taipei]], [[\u014cmura, Nagasaki|Omura]], and [[Jeju City]] to attack [[Hankou District|Hankow]]. The bombers and the reconnaissance aircraft were escorted by 13 [[A6M Zero]]s of 12th{{Clarify|date=August 2013|reason=Should this be '1st', '12th' or something else?}} ''K\u014dk\u016btai'' led by the IJN lieutenant, Saburo Shindo. A similar operation occurred in May 1941. In December 1941, 107 G4Ms based on [[Formosa]] of 1st ''K\u014dk\u016btai'' and ''Kanoya K\u014dk\u016btai'' belonging to the 21st ''Koku Sentai'' (air flotilla) crossed the [[Luzon Strait]] en route to bombing the [[Philippines]]; this was the beginning of Japanese invasions in the [[Southwest Pacific Theater]].\n[[File:Mitsubishi G4M1 bombers attack the invasion force between Guadalcanal and Tulagi on 8 August 1942 (80-G-17066).jpg|thumb|right|IJN aviators pressed home a torpedo attack against American ships off Guadalcanal on 8 August 1942, suffering heavy losses. The plane on the left and at extreme low-level (approximately five meters) was flown by Jun Takahashi, who was still alive in 2016.]]\n\nIn its first year of combat the G4M was a success, attacking U.S. Army air base [[Clark Air Base|Clark Field]], [[Philippines]] on December 8, 1941 and taking part in the operation to sink [[HMS Prince of Wales (53)|HMS ''Prince of Wales'']] and [[HMS Repulse (1916)|HMS ''Repulse'']] two days later.  Against weak fighter opposition the G4M attacked targets ranging as far as the Aleutians to Australia using its long range, the drawbacks of no self-sealing fuel tanks and armor not presenting themselves as problems at this point.<ref name=Smithsonian/>\n\nThe G4M's most notable use as a torpedo bomber was in the [[sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|sinking of ''Prince of Wales'' and ''Repulse'']] off the eastern coast of [[British Malaya|Malaya]] on 10 December 1941. The G4Ms attacked along with older [[Mitsubishi G3M]] \"Nell\" bombers, which made high-level bombing runs. ''Prince of Wales'' and ''Repulse'' were the first two [[capital ship]]s to be sunk exclusively by air attacks during a war, while in open waters. The bomber crews were from the Kanoya Air Group of Kanoya K\u014dk\u016btai (751 Ku), Genzan Air Group of Genzan K\u014dk\u016btai (753 Ku), and the Mihoro Air Group of Mihoro K\u014dk\u016btai (701 Ku), trained in torpedo attacks at an altitude of less than {{convert|10|m|-1}}, and in long-range over-ocean navigation, so they could attack naval targets moving quickly at sea. Nine G4Ms participated in the long-range bombing raid of [[Katherine, Northern Territory]], on 22 March 1942 (the deepest inland attack on Australian territory during the war at over 200 miles from the coast). G4Ms later made many attacks against Allied ships and also land targets during the six-month-long [[Guadalcanal Campaign]] (in the [[Solomon Islands]]) in late 1942.\n\nOn 8 August 1942, during the second day of the U.S. Marine landings on Guadalcanal, 23 IJNAF torpedo-carrying G4M1s attacked American ships at Lunga Point. 18 of the G4M1s were shot down, by very heavy anti-aircraft fire and carrier-based [[Grumman F4F Wildcat|F4F]] fighters. In all 18 Japanese crews&nbsp;\u2013 approximately 120 aviators&nbsp;\u2013 were lost at the beginning of August 1942. More than 100 G4M1s and their pilots and crews were lost (with no replacements or substitutes available) during the many battles over and near Guadalcanal (August to October 1942).<ref>{{Harvnb|Fumio|1958|p=?.}}</ref> In the two days of the [[Battle of Rennell Island]], 29 and 30 January 1943, 10 out of 43 G4M1s were shot down during night torpedo attacks, all by U.S. Navy anti-aircraft fire. About 70 Japanese aviators, including [[Lieutenant Commander]] Higai, were killed during that battle.\n\n[[File:Crashed Mitsubishi G4M floating off Tulagi on 8 August 1942 (80-G-K-383).jpg|thumb|right|Crashed G4M1 floating at Tulagi 8 August 1942]]\n\nProbably the best-known incident involving a G4M during the war was the attack resulting in the [[Operation Vengeance|death of Admiral Yamamoto]]. On 18 April 1943, sixteen [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning|P-38 Lightnings]] of the [[339th Flight Test Squadron|339th Fighter Squadron]] of the [[347th Fighter Group]], [[Thirteenth Air Force]], shot down a G4M1 of the 705th Kokutai with the tailcode \"T1-323\", carrying Admiral Yamamoto.\n\n[[File:Yamamoto's airplane crash.jpg|thumb|right|Yamamoto's G4M1 in the aftermath of the attack]]\n\nThe G4M Model ''11'' was replaced by the Models ''22'', ''22a/b'', ''24a/b'', ''25'', ''26'', and ''27'' from June 1943 onward, giving service in [[New Guinea]], [[the Solomons]], and the South Pacific area, in defense of the [[Marianas]] and finally in [[Okinawa]]. Other G4Ms received field modifications, resulting in the Model ''24j''. This model carried the [[Yokosuka MXY7]] ''Ohka'' Model ''11'' suicide flying bomb, beginning on 21 March 1945, with disastrous results due to heavy Allied fighter opposition.\n\nAfter the loss of Okinawa, G4Ms constituted the main weapon of the land-based Japanese naval bomber force. It consisted of 20 K\u014dk\u016btai at the end of the war. This included the testing air group, which was equipped in 1944\u201345 with the latest version G4M3 Models ''34'' and ''36'', though these arrived too late to affect the course of the war.\n\nFrom November 1944 to January 1945, G4Ms were one of the main types of aircraft used in the [[Japanese air attacks on the Mariana Islands]], and plans to use converted G4Ms to land [[commando]]s on the islands were developed in mid-1945 and cancelled only at the end of the war.\n\nAs part of the negotiations for the [[surrender of Japan]], two demilitarized G4Ms, given the call-signs [[Bataan 1 and Bataan 2]], flew to [[Iejima|Ie Shima]], carrying the first surrender delegations on the first leg of their flight to [[Manila]]. The G4Ms were painted white with green crosses, and were escorted by American P-38 fighters.<ref name=\"Gallagher\">{{cite book|last=Gallagher|first=James P|title=Meatballs and Dead Birds: A Photo Gallery of Destroyed Japanese Aircraft in World War II|year=2004|publisher=Stackpole Books|location=USA|isbn=9780811731614|pages=154}}</ref>\n\nThe G4M's intended successor was the [[Yokosuka P1Y]] Ginga, although because of production problems, the changeover was only begun by the time the war ended.\n\n==Variants==\n\n===G4M1===\n;G4M1 prototypes: ('''Mitsubishi Navy Type 1 attack bomber''') / ('''Mitsubishi Navy Experimental 12-Shi land attacker''').

The first bomber model of series, with {{convert|1140|kW|hp|abbr=on}} [[Mitsubishi Kasei|Mitsubishi MK4A \"Kasei\" Model 11]] engines driving three-blade propellers. The following modifications were made during production:\n* March 1942: the first aircraft (241st production example) fitted with [[Mitsubishi Kasei|Mitsubishi MK4E \"Kasei\" Model 15]] engines with larger [[supercharger]]s for better high altitude performance, became standard in August 1942 from 406th aircraft onwards.

It differed from the preceding model in having [[Mitsubishi Kasei|Mitsubishi MK4P \"Kasei\" Model 21]] engines with VDM electric four-blade propellers capable of full feathering function, redesigned main wings with LB type [[laminar flow]] airfoil.{{#tag:ref|LB type laminar airfoil was designed by Professor Tani of Tokyo University in 1937.|group=N}} and widened tail horizontal stabilizer wing area, which improved service ceiling to {{convert|8950|m|ft|abbr=on}} and maximum speed to {{convert|437|kph|kn mph|abbr=on}}. Main wing fuel tanks were enlarged to {{convert|6490|l|USgal impgal|abbr=on}} which increased the range to {{convert|6000|km|nmi mi|abbr=on}} (overloaded, one way). An electrically powered dorsal turret featuring a {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on|3}} [[Type 99 cannon]] was introduced in place of G4M1's dorsal position with a {{convert|7.7|mm|in|abbr=on|3}} [[Type 92 machine gun]], total guns armed were two {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on|3}} [[Type 99 cannon]]s (one tail turret, one top turret), and four {{convert|7.7|mm|in|abbr=on|3}} [[Type 92 machine gun]]s (one nose, two waist, and one cockpit side). External differences also included increased nose glazing, flush side gun positions instead of blisters, and rounded tips of wings and tail surfaces. These major improvements also made it possible for the G4M2 to carry more powerful bombs; one {{convert|1055|kg|lb|abbr=on}} [[Navy Type 91 Kai-7 aerial torpedo]] or one {{convert|800|kg|lb|abbr=on}} bomb or two {{convert|500|kg|lb|abbr=on}} bombs or one {{convert|800|kg|lb|abbr=on}} [[Type 3 No. 31 bomb]] (ray-detective type bomb) and twelve {{convert|60|kg|lb|abbr=on}} bombs.

Its official designation is '''Mitsubishi Navy Type 1 attack bomber''' (\u4e00\u5f0f\u9678\u4e0a\u653b\u6483\u6a5f, \u4e00\u5f0f\u9678\u653b ''Ichishiki rikuj\u014d k\u014dgeki ki, Ichishikirikk\u014d'') and was commonly referred to by Japanese Navy pilots as {{nihongo|''Hamaki''|\u8449\u5dfb|extra=\"cigar\", lit. \"leaf roll\"}} due to the cylindrical shape of its fuselage. The [[World War II Allied names for Japanese aircraft|Allied reporting name]] was \"'''Betty'''\".<ref name=Francillon/>\n\nDesigned to a strict specification to succeed the [[Mitsubishi G3M]] already in service, the G4M boasted very good performance and excellent range and was considered the best land-based naval bomber at the time.<ref name=Francillon/> This was achieved by its structural lightness and an almost total lack of protection for the crew, with no armor plating or [[self-sealing fuel tank]]s.<ref name=murphy-mcnniece>{{cite book |last1=Murphy |first1=Justin D. |last2=McNiece |first2=Mathew A. |title=Military Aircraft, 1919-1945: An Illustrated History of Their Impact |year=1979 |publisher=Putnam & Company Limited |location=London |isbn=1851094989 |pages=150\u2013151}}</ref> The G4M was officially adopted on 2 April 1941 but the lack of armour and self-sealing fuel tanks would prove to be a severe drawback, often suffering heavy losses; [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]] pilots nicknamed the G4M \"The Flying Lighter\" as it was extremely prone to ignition after a few hits.<ref name=Francillon/><ref name=\"marting4m\"/><ref name=murphy-mcnniece/> It was not until later variants of the G4M2 and G4M3 that self-sealing fuel tanks, armor protection for the crew and better defensive armament was installed.\n\nNevertheless, the G4M would become the Navy's primary land-based bomber. It is the most widely produced and most famous bomber operated by the Japanese during  World War II and it served in nearly all battles during the [[Pacific War]].<ref name=Francillon/><ref name=murphy-mcnniece/> The aircraft is also known for being the [[mothership]] that carried the [[Yokosuka MXY-7 Ohka]], a purpose-built anti-ship suicide weapon during the final years of the war.<ref name=osamutagaya>{{cite book |last=Tagaya |first=Osamu |title=Mitsubishi Type 1 Rikko \u2018Betty\u2019 Units of World War 2|year=2001 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |location= |isbn=184176082X |pages=90\u201395}}</ref> Of the 2400 G4Ms produced, no intact aircraft have survived.\n\n==Design and development==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}\nThe G4Ms predecessor the [[Mitsubishi G3M]] went into service in 1937 in China.<ref name=Smithsonian>{{cite web |title=Mitsubishi G4M3 Model 34 BETTY |url=https://www.si.edu/object/nasm_A19600336000 |website=Smithsonian Institution |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |accessdate=1 October 2019 |language=en}}</ref>  Only two months later the Japanese Navy issued specifications to Mitsubishi.<ref name=Smithsonian/>  The specifications, unprecedented at the time, called for a twin-engine, land-based, attack bomber with a top speed of {{convert|398|km/h|mph}}, altitude of {{convert|3,000|m|ft}}, and a range of {{convert|4,722|km|mi}} unloaded (with bombs and torpedoes), and a range of {{convert|3,700|km|mi}} when carrying an {{convert|800|kg|lb}} torpedo or the same weight in bombs.<ref name=Smithsonian/>\n\nThe G4M was designed for a long range and high speed at the time of its introduction.  In order to meet the Navy's specifications a Mitsubishi team lead by Kiro Honjo did not incorporate [[self-sealing fuel tanks]] and armor plating to save weight and extend range.<ref name=Smithsonian/> This consequently made both the G4M and the Zero, which Mitsubishi used the same design features, vulnerable to machine gun and cannon fire.<ref name=Smithsonian/>  Consequently, Allied fighter pilots to give it derisive nicknames such as \"the flying lighter\"<ref name=Smithsonian/> \"the one-shot lighter\", \"the flying [[Zippo]]\" and \"the flying cigar\" because of their tendency to ignite from damage to the wing fuel tanks after being hit by gunfire.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} The pilots of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] called the G4M the \"''hamaki''\" (\"cigar\"), however this was due to its shape.<ref name=Smithsonian/>  Due to deficiencies of the G3M in warding off concentrated fighter attacks Honjo incorporated {{convert|7.7| mm|inch|abbr=on}} guns in the nose, on top and both sides of the fuselage and in the tail a {{convert|20|mm|inch|abbr=on}} cannon was added.<ref name=Smithsonian/>\n\n[[File:G4M-49.jpg |thumb|right|A Mitsubishi G4M1; with a non-standard roundel - a white square instead of the white circle surrounding the [[hinomaru]].]]\n\nWhen used for medium- to high-altitude bombing against stationary land targets like supply depots, seaports or airfields, it was much harder to intercept. Using its long range and high speed, the G4M could appear from any direction, and then it could be gone before any fighters intercepted them. The 20&nbsp;mm cannon in its tail turret was much heavier armament than was commonly carried by bombers of either side, making aerial attacks from the rear quite dangerous for the Allied fighter aircraft. Sometimes, assuming they did not catch fire after being hit in the wings by flak from the ground or by machine gun bullets from enemy fighters, G4Ms also proved to be able to remain airborne despite being badly damaged. For example, after the attack of the ''751 [[K\u014dk\u016btai]]'' (air group) on the [[USS Chicago (CA-29)|USS ''Chicago'']] during the [[Battle of Rennell Island]], three out of four surviving aircraft (of the original eleven) returned despite flying with only one engine.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nAs the war continued improved bomber designs failed to materialize and Mitsubishi began creating additional versions to fulfill various news missions as well as eliminate the weakness in the design including various engine and weapon variants.  The G4M2 redesign failed  to shore up the G4Ms vulnerability to weapons fire.<ref name=Smithsonian/>\n\n===First flight===\nThe first G4M prototype left Mitsubishi's Nagoya plant in September 1939 disassembled and loaded in five ox-drawn farm carts to Kagamigahara <!-- Kakamigahara, Gifu?

These were all commonly used in anti-ship roles. The G4M Model ''11'' was prominent in attacks on Allied shipping from 1941 to early 1944, but after that it became increasingly easy prey for Allied fighters.\n\nThe G4M was first used in combat on 13 September 1940 in [[Mainland China]], when 27 \"Bettys\" and [[Mitsubishi C5M]]s of 1st ''Rengo [[K\u014dk\u016btai]]'' (a mixed force including elements of the ''Kanoya'' and ''Kizarazu'' ''[[K\u014dk\u016btai]]'') departed from [[Taipei]], [[\u014cmura, Nagasaki|Omura]], and [[Jeju City]] to attack [[Hankou District|Hankow]]. The bombers and the reconnaissance aircraft were escorted by 13 [[A6M Zero]]s of 12th{{Clarify|date=August 2013|reason=Should this be '1st', '12th' or something else?}} ''K\u014dk\u016btai'' led by the IJN lieutenant, Saburo Shindo. A similar operation occurred in May 1941. In December 1941, 107 G4Ms based on [[Formosa]] of 1st ''K\u014dk\u016btai'' and ''Kanoya K\u014dk\u016btai'' belonging to the 21st ''Koku Sentai'' (air flotilla) crossed the [[Luzon Strait]] en route to bombing the [[Philippines]]; this was the beginning of Japanese invasions in the [[Southwest Pacific Theater]].\n[[File:Mitsubishi G4M1 bombers attack the invasion force between Guadalcanal and Tulagi on 8 August 1942 (80-G-17066).jpg|thumb|right|IJN aviators pressed home a torpedo attack against American ships off Guadalcanal on 8 August 1942, suffering heavy losses. The plane on the left and at extreme low-level (approximately five meters) was flown by Jun Takahashi, who was still alive in 2016.]]\n\nIn its first year of combat the G4M was a success, attacking U.S. Army air base [[Clark Air Base|Clark Field]], [[Philippines]] on December 8, 1941 and taking part in the operation to sink [[HMS Prince of Wales (53)|HMS ''Prince of Wales'']] and [[HMS Repulse (1916)|HMS ''Repulse'']] two days later.  Against weak fighter opposition the G4M attacked targets ranging as far as the Aleutians to Australia using its long range, the drawbacks of no self-sealing fuel tanks and armor not presenting themselves as problems at this point.<ref name=Smithsonian/>\n\nThe G4M's most notable use as a torpedo bomber was in the [[sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|sinking of ''Prince of Wales'' and ''Repulse'']] off the eastern coast of [[British Malaya|Malaya]] on 10 December 1941. The G4Ms attacked along with older [[Mitsubishi G3M]] \"Nell\" bombers, which made high-level bombing runs. ''Prince of Wales'' and ''Repulse'' were the first two [[capital ship]]s to be sunk exclusively by air attacks during a war, while in open waters. The bomber crews were from the Kanoya Air Group of Kanoya K\u014dk\u016btai (751 Ku), Genzan Air Group of Genzan K\u014dk\u016btai (753 Ku), and the Mihoro Air Group of Mihoro K\u014dk\u016btai (701 Ku), trained in torpedo attacks at an altitude of less than {{convert|10|m|-1}}, and in long-range over-ocean navigation, so they could attack naval targets moving quickly at sea. Nine G4Ms participated in the long-range bombing raid of [[Katherine, Northern Territory]], on 22 March 1942 (the deepest inland attack on Australian territory during the war at over 200 miles from the coast). G4Ms later made many attacks against Allied ships and also land targets during the six-month-long [[Guadalcanal Campaign]] (in the [[Solomon Islands]]) in late 1942.\n\nOn 8 August 1942, during the second day of the U.S. Marine landings on Guadalcanal, 23 IJNAF torpedo-carrying G4M1s attacked American ships at Lunga Point. 18 of the G4M1s were shot down, by very heavy anti-aircraft fire and carrier-based [[Grumman F4F Wildcat|F4F]] fighters. In all 18 Japanese crews&nbsp;\u2013 approximately 120 aviators&nbsp;\u2013 were lost at the beginning of August 1942. More than 100 G4M1s and their pilots and crews were lost (with no replacements or substitutes available) during the many battles over and near Guadalcanal (August to October 1942).<ref>{{Harvnb|Fumio|1958|p=?.}}</ref> In the two days of the [[Battle of Rennell Island]], 29 and 30 January 1943, 10 out of 43 G4M1s were shot down during night torpedo attacks, all by U.S. Navy anti-aircraft fire. About 70 Japanese aviators, including [[Lieutenant Commander]] Higai, were killed during that battle.\n\n[[File:Crashed Mitsubishi G4M floating off Tulagi on 8 August 1942 (80-G-K-383).jpg|thumb|right|Crashed G4M1 floating at Tulagi 8 August 1942]]\n\nProbably the best-known incident involving a G4M during the war was the attack resulting in the [[Operation Vengeance|death of Admiral Yamamoto]]. On 18 April 1943, sixteen [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning|P-38 Lightnings]] of the [[339th Flight Test Squadron|339th Fighter Squadron]] of the [[347th Fighter Group]], [[Thirteenth Air Force]], shot down a G4M1 of the 705th Kokutai with the tailcode \"T1-323\", carrying Admiral Yamamoto.\n\n[[File:Yamamoto's airplane crash.jpg|thumb|right|Yamamoto's G4M1 in the aftermath of the attack]]\n\nThe G4M Model ''11'' was replaced by the Models ''22'', ''22a/b'', ''24a/b'', ''25'', ''26'', and ''27'' from June 1943 onward, giving service in [[New Guinea]], [[the Solomons]], and the South Pacific area, in defense of the [[Marianas]] and finally in [[Okinawa]]. Other G4Ms received field modifications, resulting in the Model ''24j''. This model carried the [[Yokosuka MXY7]] ''Ohka'' Model ''11'' suicide flying bomb, beginning on 21 March 1945, with disastrous results due to heavy Allied fighter opposition.\n\nAfter the loss of Okinawa, G4Ms constituted the main weapon of the land-based Japanese naval bomber force. It consisted of 20 K\u014dk\u016btai at the end of the war. This included the testing air group, which was equipped in 1944\u201345 with the latest version G4M3 Models ''34'' and ''36'', though these arrived too late to affect the course of the war.\n\nFrom November 1944 to January 1945, G4Ms were one of the main types of aircraft used in the [[Japanese air attacks on the Mariana Islands]], and plans to use converted G4Ms to land [[commando]]s on the islands were developed in mid-1945 and cancelled only at the end of the war.\n\nAs part of the negotiations for the [[surrender of Japan]], two demilitarized G4Ms, given the call-signs [[Bataan 1 and Bataan 2]], flew to [[Iejima|Ie Shima]], carrying the first surrender delegations on the first leg of their flight to [[Manila]]. The G4Ms were painted white with green crosses, and were escorted by American P-38 fighters.<ref name=\"Gallagher\">{{cite book|last=Gallagher|first=James P|title=Meatballs and Dead Birds: A Photo Gallery of Destroyed Japanese Aircraft in World War II|year=2004|publisher=Stackpole Books|location=USA|isbn=9780811731614|pages=154}}</ref>\n\nThe G4M's intended successor was the [[Yokosuka P1Y]] Ginga, although because of production problems, the changeover was only begun by the time the war ended.\n\n==Variants==\n\n===G4M1===\n;G4M1 prototypes: ('''Mitsubishi Navy Type 1 attack bomber''') / ('''Mitsubishi Navy Experimental 12-Shi land attacker''').

These MK4E-engined aircraft have often (erroneously) been referred as the \"G4M1 Model 12\".\n* Summer 1942: propeller [[Spinner (aircraft)|spinners]] introduced\n* March 1943: from 663rd machine onwards, {{convert|30|mm|in|abbr=on|3}} rubber ply sheets installed beneath the wing outer surfaces to protect the underside of the fuel tanks (speed reduced by {{convert|9|kph|kn mph|abbr=on}} and range by {{convert|315|km|nmi mi|abbr=on}}, {{convert|5|mm|in|abbr=on|3}} [[Vehicle armour|armour plates]] added into tail gunner's compartment.\n* Spring 1943: outer half of the tail cone cut away in order to improve tail gunner's field of fire.\n* August 1943: a completely redesigned tail cone, with reduced framing and wide V-shaped cut out; this form of tail cone was also used in all G4M2 models.\n* September 1943: individual exhaust stacks from 954th airframe onwards\n\nProduction of the G4M1 ended in January 1944.\n\n===G4M2===\nThe first of the four G4M2 prototypes flew in December 1942 ('''Mitsubishi Navy Type 1 Attack Bomber Model 22'''). It differed from the preceding model in having [[Mitsubishi Kasei|Mitsubishi MK4P \"Kasei\" Model 21]] engines with VDM electric four-blade propellers capable of full feathering function, redesigned main wings with LB type [[laminar flow]] airfoil.{{#tag:ref|LB type laminar airfoil was designed by Professor Tani of Tokyo University in 1937.|group=N}} and widened tail horizontal stabilizer wing area, which improved service ceiling to {{convert|8950|m|ft|abbr=on}} and maximum speed to {{convert|437|kph|kn mph|abbr=on}}. Main wing fuel tanks were enlarged to {{convert|6490|l|USgal impgal|abbr=on}} which increased the range to {{convert|6000|km|nmi mi|abbr=on}} (overloaded, one way). An electrically powered dorsal turret featuring a {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on|3}} [[Type 99 cannon]] was introduced in place of G4M1's dorsal position with a {{convert|7.7|mm|in|abbr=on|3}} [[Type 92 machine gun]], total guns armed were two {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on|3}} [[Type 99 cannon]]s (one tail turret, one top turret), and four {{convert|7.7|mm|in|abbr=on|3}} [[Type 92 machine gun]]s (one nose, two waist, and one cockpit side). External differences also included increased nose glazing, flush side gun positions instead of blisters, and rounded tips of wings and tail surfaces. These major improvements also made it possible for the G4M2 to carry more powerful bombs; one {{convert|1055|kg|lb|abbr=on}} [[Navy Type 91 Kai-7 aerial torpedo]] or one {{convert|800|kg|lb|abbr=on}} bomb or two {{convert|500|kg|lb|abbr=on}} bombs or one {{convert|800|kg|lb|abbr=on}} [[Type 3 No. 31 bomb]] (ray-detective type bomb) and twelve {{convert|60|kg|lb|abbr=on}} bombs. The G4M2 entered service in mid-1943.\n\n[[File:G4M Type 1 Attack Bomber Betty launching Baka G4M-10.jpg|thumb|right|G4M2e Model 24 ''Tei'' launching a suicide [[Yokosuka MXY-7 Ohka]] \"Baka\" (wind tunnel model experiment)]]\n[[File:Betty bomber Darwin (AWM P02822-001).jpg|thumb|right|Betty bombers during an [[Air raids on Australia, 1942\u201343|air raid over Darwin, Australia]].]]\n\n;G4M2 Model 22: ('''Mitsubishi Navy Type 1 Attack Bomber Model 22''') the base model, the first production example completed in July 1943.

It resulted in the fall of the Sikh Empire, and the annexation of the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] and what subsequently became the [[North-West Frontier Province]], by the East India Company.\n\nOn 19 April 1848 [[Patrick Alexander Vans Agnew|Patrick Vans Agnew]] of the civil service and Lieutenant William Anderson of the Bombay European regiment, having been sent to take charge of [[Multan]] from [[Diwan Mulraj]] Chopra, were murdered there, and within a short time the [[Sikh]] troops joined in open rebellion. [[Governor-General of India]] [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]] agreed with [[Hugh Gough, 1st Viscount Gough|Sir Hugh Gough]], the commander-in-chief, that the [[British East India Company]]'s military forces were neither adequately equipped with transport and supplies, nor otherwise prepared to take the field immediately. He also foresaw the spread of the rebellion, and the necessity that must arise, not merely for the capture of Multan, but also for the entire subjugation of the [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. He therefore resolutely delayed to strike, organized a strong army for operations in November, and himself proceeded to the Punjab. Despite the brilliant successes gained by [[Herbert Benjamin Edwardes|Herbert Edwardes]] against Mulraj, and Gough's indecisive victories at [[Battle of Ramnagar|Ramnagar]] in November, at [[Battle of Sadulapur|Sadulapur]] in December, and at the [[Battle of Chillianwala]] on 13 January 1849, the stubborn resistance at Multan showed that the task required the utmost resources of the government. At length, on 22 January, Multan was taken by General Whish, who was thus set at liberty to join Gough's army. On 21 February, Gough won a complete victory at the [[Battle of Gujrat]]. The Sikh army was pursued to [[Rawalpindi]], where it laid down its arms, and their Afghan allies retreated from the Punjab.\n\nAfter the victory at Gujarat, Lord Dalhousie annexed the Punjab for the East India Company in 1849. For his services the Earl of Dalhousie received the thanks of the British parliament and a step in the peerage, as marquess.\n\n==Background of the War==\nThe Sikh Confederacy [[Misl]]s of the Punjab were consolidated into an Empire and expanded by Maharaja [[Ranjit Singh]] during the early years of the nineteenth century. During the same period, the British East India Company's territories had been expanded until they were adjacent to the Punjab. Ranjit Singh maintained an uneasy alliance with the East India Company, while increasing the military strength of the [[Sikh Khalsa Army]], which also saw itself as the embodiment of the state and religion, to deter British aggression against his state and to expand Sikh territory to the north and north west, capturing territory from [[Afghanistan]] and [[Kashmir]].\n\nWhen Ranjit Singh died in 1839, the Sikh Empire began to fall into disorder. There was a succession of short-lived rulers at the central [[Durbar (court)|Durbar]] (court), and increasing tension between the Army and the Durbar. The East India Company began to build up its military strength on the borders of the Punjab. Eventually, the increasing tension goaded the Sikh Army to invade British territory, under weak and possibly treacherous leaders.<ref name=eos>{{cite web |url=http://www.learnpunjabi.org/eos/index.aspx\n|title=ANGLO-SIKH WAR I (1845-46) |last1=Hasrat |first=B. J.\n|website=Encyclopaedia of Sikhism\n|publisher=Punjabi University Patiala\n|access-date=}}</ref>\nThe hard-fought [[First Anglo-Sikh War]] ended in defeat for the Sikh Army.\n\n===Aftermath of the First Anglo-Sikh War===\nAt the end of the war, the Sikh Empire was forced to cede some valuable territory (the [[Jullundur Doab]]) to the East India Company, and [[Gulab Singh]], the ruler of [[Jammu]], was allowed to acquire entire [[Jammu]] and [[Kashmir]] from the Sikh Empire by a large cash payment to the East India Company. Some of the Sikh Army were forced to make an expedition to oust the Governor of Kashmir in favour of Gulab Singh.<ref>Hernon 2002, p.575</ref>\n\nThe infant Maharaja [[Duleep Singh]] of the Sikh Empire was allowed to retain his throne, but a British Resident, Sir [[Henry Montgomery Lawrence|Henry Lawrence]], controlled the policy of the Durbar. Duleep Singh's mother, Maharani [[Jind Kaur]], continually tried to regain some of her former influence as Regent and was eventually exiled by Lawrence. While some Sikh generals and courtiers welcomed her dismissal, others resented Lawrence's action.<ref>Hernon 2002, p.576</ref>  Furthermore, the Sikh Sardars were forced to considerably reduce their territorial and judicial control leaving only four Sardars in charge of the judiciary, with Sardar Chattar Singh Atariwalla controlling the area between the [[Jhelum]] and the [[Indus]], Sardar Kahan Singh Mann controlling [[Lahore]], Sardar Ram Singh Jallawala controlling the Chaj [[Doab]], and Sardar [[Lehna Singh Majithia]] controlling the [[Manjha]] including lands south east of the [[Ravi River|Ravi]] up to the hills and down to [[Kasur]].<ref>Khushwant Singh, A History of the Sikhs (1839-1974), Vol. II, p. 62.</ref>\n\nSome of the Sikh Army had to be kept in being, since many predominantly [[Muslim]] areas of the Sikh Empire threatened to ally with [[Dost Mohammed Khan]] in Afghanistan or to lapse into disorder, and only force of arms could keep them in subjugation. The British were unwilling to incur the financial and manpower costs of using large numbers of British or [[Bengal Army]] units for this task. To the contrary, the [[Governor-General of India]], [[Henry Hardinge, 1st Viscount Hardinge|Viscount Hardinge]] sought to make economies after the war by reducing the size of the Bengal Army by 50,000 men. The [[Sardars]] (generals) of the Sikh Army naturally resented carrying out the orders of comparatively junior British officers and administrators.\n\nEarly in 1848, Sir Henry Lawrence, who was ill, departed on leave to England. Although it was assumed that his younger brother [[John Lawrence, 1st Baron Lawrence|John Lawrence]] would be appointed in his place, [[James Andrew Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]], who had replaced Lord Hardinge as Governor-General, appointed Sir [[Sir Frederick Currie, 1st Baronet|Frederick Currie]] instead. Currie was a legalist, based in [[Calcutta]], who was unfamiliar with military matters and with the Punjab.<ref>Allen 2000, pp. 145\u2013146</ref> While the Lawrences were comparatively informal and familiar with the junior officers who were Residents and Agents in the various districts of the Punjab, Currie was stiffer in manner and was inclined to treat his subordinates' reports with caution. In particular, he refused to act on reports from [[James Abbott (Indian Army officer)|James Abbott]], the Political Agent in Hazara, who was convinced that Sardar [[Chattar Singh Attariwalla]], the Sikh Governor of [[Hazara, Pakistan|Hazara]], was actively plotting a rebellion with other [[Sardar|Sirdars]].\n\n==First outbreak==\nThe city of [[Multan]] was part of the Sikh kingdom, having been captured by Ranjit Singh in 1818. In 1848, it was governed by a [[Hindu]] viceroy, [[Dewan Mulraj]]. After the end of the First Anglo-Sikh war, Mulraj had behaved independently. When he was required by the British-controlled Durbar in [[Lahore]] to pay an increased tax assessment and revenues which were in arrears, Mulraj attempted to give up power to his son, so as to maintain his family's position as rulers. Currie instead urged Sardar Kahan Singh Mann, a Sikh noble, to succeed the governorship and commanded a British Political Agent, Lieutenant [[Patrick Alexander Vans Agnew|Patrick Vans Agnew]], to accompany him.\n\nOn 18 April 1848, Vans Agnew arrived at Multan with another officer, Lieutenant William Anderson, and a small escort. Mulraj handed over the keys of the fortress, but as Vans Agnew's party attempted to take possession, they were attacked by a party of Mulraj's irregular troops, and a mob from the city. Both officers were wounded, and were rescued by Sardar Kahan Singh Mann. They were taken to a mosque outside the city. Their escorts defected to Mulraj, and the officers were murdered by the mob the next day.<ref>Allen 2000, pp. 149\u2013150</ref>\n\nMulraj later claimed that he had not instigated these attacks, but he was committed to rebellion because of them.<ref>Hernon 2002, p. 578</ref> He presented Vans Agnew's head to Sardar Kahan Singh Mann, and told him to take it back to Lahore.<ref>Allen 2000, p. 150</ref> The news of the killings spread over the Punjab, and unrest and disquiet increased. Large numbers of Sikh soldiers deserted the regiments loyal to the Durbar to join those prepared to rebel under the leadership of Mulraj and disaffected Sirdars.\n\n===Subsequent outbreaks===\nLieutenant [[Herbert Edwardes]], the British Political Agent in [[Bannu]], had been near Multan in April but was unable to save Vans Agnew. He hastily levied some [[Pakhtun]] irregular troops, and together with some Sikh regiments, defeated Mulraj's army at the [[Battle of Kineyri]] near the [[Chenab River]] on 18 June. He drove them back to the city but was unable to attack the fortified city itself.\n\nMeanwhile, on learning of the events at Multan, Currie wrote to Sir [[Hugh Gough, 1st Viscount Gough|Hugh Gough]], the Commander in Chief of the Bengal Army, recommending that a major British force should at once move upon Multan. However Gough, supported by Dalhousie, the Governor General, declined to order major units of the East India Company to the Punjab until the end of the hot weather and monsoon seasons, which would not be until November.<ref>Malleson, p. 40</ref> Instead, Currie ordered only a small force from the Bengal Army under General Whish to begin the siege of the city, joined by several contingents of locally recruited irregulars and detachments of the [[Sikh Khalsa Army]]. These forces joined Edwardes at Multan between 18 and 28 August. To the alarm of several Political Agents, the force from the Sikh Army included a large contingent commanded by Sardar [[Sher Singh Attariwalla]], Chattar Singh's son.\n\nSome Agents were already taking action to forestall outbreaks of rebellion. Captain [[John Nicholson (East India Company officer)|John Nicholson]], leading irregular cavalry based at [[Peshawar]], seized the vital fort of [[Attock]] on the [[Indus River]] from its Sikh garrison while they were still unprepared, or undecided on rebellion. Nicholson's force then linked up with James Abbott's local Hazara levies to capture the [[Margalla Hills]] which separated Hazara from the other parts of the Punjab. When Chattar Singh openly rebelled in August, his force was unable to leave Hazara without fighting a battle. Although Chattar Singh twice succeeded in capturing the passes through the hills, he nevertheless failed to take advantage of this (possibly because of dissension among his senior officers and continual harassment by pro-British irregulars), and retreated into Hazara.\n\nOn 14 September, Sher Singh's army openly rebelled at Multan. He did not join Mulraj however. He and Mulraj conferred at a carefully chosen neutral site, at which it was agreed that Mulraj would give some money from his treasury to Sher Singh's army, which would march north into the Central Punjab and ultimately rejoin Chattar Singh. Meanwhile, Whish was forced to raise the siege until he was reinforced.\n\n==Course of the war==\nAs the cold weather began in November, substantial contingents from the East India Company's armies at last took the field.\n\nA contingent from the [[Bombay Army]] (administered separately from the Bengal Army) had been ordered to reinforce Whish and besiege Multan. This force was delayed by a petty squabble over seniority and could arrive only when its first commander (who was senior to Whish and refused to serve under him) was replaced by a more junior officer. Whish's army was supplied and reinforced by sea and river transport up the rivers Indus and Chenab.\n\nSir Hugh Gough led his main force against Sher Singh's army, which defended the line of the River Chenab against Gough for several weeks. On 22 November, the Sikhs repelled a British cavalry attack on a bridgehead on the eastern side of the river at the [[Battle of Ramnagar]]. Although they subsequently withdrew from their exposed bridgehead, the Sikhs regarded the battle as a victory and their morale was raised. Gough forced his way across the Chenab in December and outflanked the Sikhs defending the fords, but his cavalry then paused to await infantry reinforcements, allowing the Sikhs to withdraw without interference.\n\nAt the start of 1849, Amir Dost Mohammed Khan of Afghanistan sided with the rebellious Sikhs, who agreed to cede the city of Peshawar and its surrounding area which had been conquered by Ranjit Singh early in the nineteenth century. Dost Mohammed Khan's support of the Sikhs was cautious, but when 3,500 Afghan horsemen approached the vital fort of Attock on the Indus River, its garrison of Muslim troops installed earlier by Nicholson defected. This allowed Chattar Singh to move out of Hazara and march west and then south, intending to link up with Sher Singh's army. Dalhousie had earlier ordered Gough to halt operations while waiting for Multan to fall, which would allow Whish to reinforce him. Learning of the fall of Attock, he instead ordered Gough to destroy Sher Singh's army before Chattar Singh could join him.\n\nGough unexpectedly encountered Sher Singh's position near the [[Jhelum River]] on 13 January 1849. Sher Singh had cunningly concealed his army, and Gough was faced with the choice of withdrawing, or attacking when it was late in the day. Gough unhesitatingly took the latter course. The resulting [[Battle of Chillianwala]] was desperately fought. Gough's troops, attacking into thick scrub without effective artillery support, suffered heavy losses. Some units lost their colours (which was regarded as a disgrace) and part of one British cavalry regiment fled in panic, resulting in the loss of four guns, also reckoned a humiliation. Sher Singh's army was also hard hit, losing twelve of its own guns.\n\nThree days of heavy rain followed, discouraging both sides from renewing battle. After both armies had faced each other for three days without renewing the action, both withdrew. Sher Singh continued northwards to join Chattar Singh, which made the battle into a strategic British defeat.\n\nThere was much alarm at the losses Gough had suffered. His tactics were severely criticised and he was replaced by General [[Charles James Napier]], although the order did not arrive until after hostilities had ceased.<ref>James 1997, p. 117</ref> Some junior officers reckoned that the true cause of the setback lay lower down the ranks. Promotion in both the British and Bengal armies came slowly, and by the time officers were appointed to command regiments and brigades, they were too old, and worn out by harsh climate and disease. At Chillianwala, several senior officers had proved unable to command their units effectively.<ref>Allen 2000, p.192</ref>\n\n===Last battles===\n[[File:The Battle of Gujrat.jpg|thumb|400px|The [[Battle of Gujrat]], the most decisive battle of the second Anglo-Sikh war]]\nMeanwhile, Whish's force completed their siege works around Multan, their batteries opened fire and made a breach in the defences, which the infantry stormed. Mulraj surrendered on 22 January. He was imprisoned for the remainder of his life. The ending of the siege allowed Whish to reinforce Gough. In particular, Whish's division had large numbers of heavy guns, which the Sikhs lacked.\n\nAs Gough's army closed in on the Sikh Army, Sher Singh attempted a last outflanking move, sending cavalry to cross the Chenab, and re-cross in Gough's rear. They were thwarted by heavy rains which made the river difficult to cross, and by British irregular cavalry led by [[Harry Burnett Lumsden]] and [[William Stephen Raikes Hodson|William Hodson]]. On 13 February, Gough attacked the Sikh Army at the [[Battle of Gujrat]]. Here, he began the battle with a three-hour bombardment from almost 100 guns, which drove the Sikhs from their hasty entrenchments. He then sent his cavalry and horse artillery after them in a pursuit which lasted for four hours.\n\nOn 12 March, Chattar Singh and Sher Singh surrendered near Rawalpindi. Some 20,000 men (mainly irregular cavalry) laid down their arms. The Afghan contingent hastily withdrew through Attock and Peshawar, which the British reoccupied. Dost Mohammed Khan later signed a treaty acknowledging British possession of these cities.\n\nOn 30 March, Duleep Singh held his last court at Lahore, at which he signed away all claims to the rule of the Punjab. A proclamation by Dalhousie, annexing the Punjab, was then read out. For his services the Earl of Dalhousie received the thanks of the British parliament and a step in the peerage, as Marquess. Gough also received rewards for his services, although his tactics at Chillianwala were to be questioned for the remainder of his life. Many of the junior British Political Agents who had organised local resistance to the Sikh Armies were to have distinguished later careers.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Sikh defeat had resulted from several causes. Their administration of the population of the Punjab had been poor, which meant that their large armies found it difficult to find enough food. Finally, the East India Company had brought overwhelming force against them.\n\nThe Sikh Wars gave the two sides a mutual respect for each other's fighting prowess (although the war itself had been unchivalrously fought; the Sikhs took no prisoners at Chillianwala, and the British had taken no prisoners at [[Battle of Gujrat|Gujrat]]).{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nThere was an increased recruitment of people from various communities of the Punjab in the Punjab Irregular Force under British command. These recruits fought for the East India Company during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], against the mutineers and other opponents (mostly high-caste Hindus from Eastern provinces, and forces or loyalists of Shia, Maratha and Mughal rulers). These Punjabi recruits had especially little sympathy with the Hindu mutineers of the Bengal Army, ironically contributed to by the latter's role in helping the British in the Anglo-Sikh wars. A long history of enmity of the Sikhs with Mughal rule did not help the mutineers' cause either, given their choice of [[Bahadur Shah Zafar]] as a symbolic leader.\n\n==Battle honour==\nThe battle honour \"''[[Punjaub]]''\" was distributed with a free hand to all regiments employed in the operations of the Anglo-Sikh Wars during 1848\u201349 vide Gazette of the Governor General 277 of 1849, and the list of regiments honoured was issued vide.

It resulted in the fall of the Sikh Empire, and the annexation of the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] and what subsequently became the [[North-West Frontier Province]], by the East India Company.\n\nOn 19 April 1848 [[Patrick Alexander Vans Agnew|Patrick Vans Agnew]] of the civil service and Lieutenant William Anderson of the Bombay European regiment, having been sent to take charge of [[Multan]] from [[Diwan Mulraj]] Chopra, were murdered there, and within a short time the [[Sikh]] troops joined in open rebellion. [[Governor-General of India]] [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]] agreed with [[Hugh Gough, 1st Viscount Gough|Sir Hugh Gough]], the commander-in-chief, that the [[British East India Company]]'s military forces were neither adequately equipped with transport and supplies, nor otherwise prepared to take the field immediately. He also foresaw the spread of the rebellion, and the necessity that must arise, not merely for the capture of Multan, but also for the entire subjugation of the [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. He therefore resolutely delayed to strike, organized a strong army for operations in November, and himself proceeded to the Punjab. Despite the brilliant successes gained by [[Herbert Benjamin Edwardes|Herbert Edwardes]] against Mulraj, and Gough's indecisive victories at [[Battle of Ramnagar|Ramnagar]] in November, at [[Battle of Sadulapur|Sadulapur]] in December, and at the [[Battle of Chillianwala]] on 13 January 1849, the stubborn resistance at Multan showed that the task required the utmost resources of the government. At length, on 22 January, Multan was taken by General Whish, who was thus set at liberty to join Gough's army. On 21 February, Gough won a complete victory at the [[Battle of Gujrat]]. The Sikh army was pursued to [[Rawalpindi]], where it laid down its arms, and their Afghan allies retreated from the Punjab.\n\nAfter the victory at Gujarat, Lord Dalhousie annexed the Punjab for the East India Company in 1849. For his services the Earl of Dalhousie received the thanks of the British parliament and a step in the peerage, as marquess.\n\n==Background of the War==\nThe Sikh Confederacy [[Misl]]s of the Punjab were consolidated into an Empire and expanded by Maharaja [[Ranjit Singh]] during the early years of the nineteenth century. During the same period, the British East India Company's territories had been expanded until they were adjacent to the Punjab. Ranjit Singh maintained an uneasy alliance with the East India Company, while increasing the military strength of the [[Sikh Khalsa Army]], which also saw itself as the embodiment of the state and religion, to deter British aggression against his state and to expand Sikh territory to the north and north west, capturing territory from [[Afghanistan]] and [[Kashmir]].\n\nWhen Ranjit Singh died in 1839, the Sikh Empire began to fall into disorder. There was a succession of short-lived rulers at the central [[Durbar (court)|Durbar]] (court), and increasing tension between the Army and the Durbar. The East India Company began to build up its military strength on the borders of the Punjab. Eventually, the increasing tension goaded the Sikh Army to invade British territory, under weak and possibly treacherous leaders.<ref name=eos>{{cite web |url=http://www.learnpunjabi.org/eos/index.aspx\n|title=ANGLO-SIKH WAR I (1845-46) |last1=Hasrat |first=B. J.\n|website=Encyclopaedia of Sikhism\n|publisher=Punjabi University Patiala\n|access-date=}}</ref>\nThe hard-fought [[First Anglo-Sikh War]] ended in defeat for the Sikh Army.\n\n===Aftermath of the First Anglo-Sikh War===\nAt the end of the war, the Sikh Empire was forced to cede some valuable territory (the [[Jullundur Doab]]) to the East India Company, and [[Gulab Singh]], the ruler of [[Jammu]], was allowed to acquire entire [[Jammu]] and [[Kashmir]] from the Sikh Empire by a large cash payment to the East India Company. Some of the Sikh Army were forced to make an expedition to oust the Governor of Kashmir in favour of Gulab Singh.<ref>Hernon 2002, p.575</ref>\n\nThe infant Maharaja [[Duleep Singh]] of the Sikh Empire was allowed to retain his throne, but a British Resident, Sir [[Henry Montgomery Lawrence|Henry Lawrence]], controlled the policy of the Durbar. Duleep Singh's mother, Maharani [[Jind Kaur]], continually tried to regain some of her former influence as Regent and was eventually exiled by Lawrence. While some Sikh generals and courtiers welcomed her dismissal, others resented Lawrence's action.<ref>Hernon 2002, p.576</ref>  Furthermore, the Sikh Sardars were forced to considerably reduce their territorial and judicial control leaving only four Sardars in charge of the judiciary, with Sardar Chattar Singh Atariwalla controlling the area between the [[Jhelum]] and the [[Indus]], Sardar Kahan Singh Mann controlling [[Lahore]], Sardar Ram Singh Jallawala controlling the Chaj [[Doab]], and Sardar [[Lehna Singh Majithia]] controlling the [[Manjha]] including lands south east of the [[Ravi River|Ravi]] up to the hills and down to [[Kasur]].<ref>Khushwant Singh, A History of the Sikhs (1839-1974), Vol. II, p. 62.</ref>\n\nSome of the Sikh Army had to be kept in being, since many predominantly [[Muslim]] areas of the Sikh Empire threatened to ally with [[Dost Mohammed Khan]] in Afghanistan or to lapse into disorder, and only force of arms could keep them in subjugation. The British were unwilling to incur the financial and manpower costs of using large numbers of British or [[Bengal Army]] units for this task. To the contrary, the [[Governor-General of India]], [[Henry Hardinge, 1st Viscount Hardinge|Viscount Hardinge]] sought to make economies after the war by reducing the size of the Bengal Army by 50,000 men. The [[Sardars]] (generals) of the Sikh Army naturally resented carrying out the orders of comparatively junior British officers and administrators.\n\nEarly in 1848, Sir Henry Lawrence, who was ill, departed on leave to England. Although it was assumed that his younger brother [[John Lawrence, 1st Baron Lawrence|John Lawrence]] would be appointed in his place, [[James Andrew Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]], who had replaced Lord Hardinge as Governor-General, appointed Sir [[Sir Frederick Currie, 1st Baronet|Frederick Currie]] instead. Currie was a legalist, based in [[Calcutta]], who was unfamiliar with military matters and with the Punjab.<ref>Allen 2000, pp. 145\u2013146</ref> While the Lawrences were comparatively informal and familiar with the junior officers who were Residents and Agents in the various districts of the Punjab, Currie was stiffer in manner and was inclined to treat his subordinates' reports with caution. In particular, he refused to act on reports from [[James Abbott (Indian Army officer)|James Abbott]], the Political Agent in Hazara, who was convinced that Sardar [[Chattar Singh Attariwalla]], the Sikh Governor of [[Hazara, Pakistan|Hazara]], was actively plotting a rebellion with other [[Sardar|Sirdars]].\n\n==First outbreak==\nThe city of [[Multan]] was part of the Sikh kingdom, having been captured by Ranjit Singh in 1818. In 1848, it was governed by a [[Hindu]] viceroy, [[Dewan Mulraj]]. After the end of the First Anglo-Sikh war, Mulraj had behaved independently. When he was required by the British-controlled Durbar in [[Lahore]] to pay an increased tax assessment and revenues which were in arrears, Mulraj attempted to give up power to his son, so as to maintain his family's position as rulers. Currie instead urged Sardar Kahan Singh Mann, a Sikh noble, to succeed the governorship and commanded a British Political Agent, Lieutenant [[Patrick Alexander Vans Agnew|Patrick Vans Agnew]], to accompany him.\n\nOn 18 April 1848, Vans Agnew arrived at Multan with another officer, Lieutenant William Anderson, and a small escort. Mulraj handed over the keys of the fortress, but as Vans Agnew's party attempted to take possession, they were attacked by a party of Mulraj's irregular troops, and a mob from the city. Both officers were wounded, and were rescued by Sardar Kahan Singh Mann. They were taken to a mosque outside the city. Their escorts defected to Mulraj, and the officers were murdered by the mob the next day.<ref>Allen 2000, pp. 149\u2013150</ref>\n\nMulraj later claimed that he had not instigated these attacks, but he was committed to rebellion because of them.<ref>Hernon 2002, p. 578</ref> He presented Vans Agnew's head to Sardar Kahan Singh Mann, and told him to take it back to Lahore.<ref>Allen 2000, p. 150</ref> The news of the killings spread over the Punjab, and unrest and disquiet increased. Large numbers of Sikh soldiers deserted the regiments loyal to the Durbar to join those prepared to rebel under the leadership of Mulraj and disaffected Sirdars.\n\n===Subsequent outbreaks===\nLieutenant [[Herbert Edwardes]], the British Political Agent in [[Bannu]], had been near Multan in April but was unable to save Vans Agnew. He hastily levied some [[Pakhtun]] irregular troops, and together with some Sikh regiments, defeated Mulraj's army at the [[Battle of Kineyri]] near the [[Chenab River]] on 18 June. He drove them back to the city but was unable to attack the fortified city itself.\n\nMeanwhile, on learning of the events at Multan, Currie wrote to Sir [[Hugh Gough, 1st Viscount Gough|Hugh Gough]], the Commander in Chief of the Bengal Army, recommending that a major British force should at once move upon Multan. However Gough, supported by Dalhousie, the Governor General, declined to order major units of the East India Company to the Punjab until the end of the hot weather and monsoon seasons, which would not be until November.<ref>Malleson, p. 40</ref> Instead, Currie ordered only a small force from the Bengal Army under General Whish to begin the siege of the city, joined by several contingents of locally recruited irregulars and detachments of the [[Sikh Khalsa Army]]. These forces joined Edwardes at Multan between 18 and 28 August. To the alarm of several Political Agents, the force from the Sikh Army included a large contingent commanded by Sardar [[Sher Singh Attariwalla]], Chattar Singh's son.\n\nSome Agents were already taking action to forestall outbreaks of rebellion. Captain [[John Nicholson (East India Company officer)|John Nicholson]], leading irregular cavalry based at [[Peshawar]], seized the vital fort of [[Attock]] on the [[Indus River]] from its Sikh garrison while they were still unprepared, or undecided on rebellion. Nicholson's force then linked up with James Abbott's local Hazara levies to capture the [[Margalla Hills]] which separated Hazara from the other parts of the Punjab. When Chattar Singh openly rebelled in August, his force was unable to leave Hazara without fighting a battle. Although Chattar Singh twice succeeded in capturing the passes through the hills, he nevertheless failed to take advantage of this (possibly because of dissension among his senior officers and continual harassment by pro-British irregulars), and retreated into Hazara.\n\nOn 14 September, Sher Singh's army openly rebelled at Multan. He did not join Mulraj however. He and Mulraj conferred at a carefully chosen neutral site, at which it was agreed that Mulraj would give some money from his treasury to Sher Singh's army, which would march north into the Central Punjab and ultimately rejoin Chattar Singh. Meanwhile, Whish was forced to raise the siege until he was reinforced.\n\n==Course of the war==\nAs the cold weather began in November, substantial contingents from the East India Company's armies at last took the field.\n\nA contingent from the [[Bombay Army]] (administered separately from the Bengal Army) had been ordered to reinforce Whish and besiege Multan. This force was delayed by a petty squabble over seniority and could arrive only when its first commander (who was senior to Whish and refused to serve under him) was replaced by a more junior officer. Whish's army was supplied and reinforced by sea and river transport up the rivers Indus and Chenab.\n\nSir Hugh Gough led his main force against Sher Singh's army, which defended the line of the River Chenab against Gough for several weeks. On 22 November, the Sikhs repelled a British cavalry attack on a bridgehead on the eastern side of the river at the [[Battle of Ramnagar]]. Although they subsequently withdrew from their exposed bridgehead, the Sikhs regarded the battle as a victory and their morale was raised. Gough forced his way across the Chenab in December and outflanked the Sikhs defending the fords, but his cavalry then paused to await infantry reinforcements, allowing the Sikhs to withdraw without interference.\n\nAt the start of 1849, Amir Dost Mohammed Khan of Afghanistan sided with the rebellious Sikhs, who agreed to cede the city of Peshawar and its surrounding area which had been conquered by Ranjit Singh early in the nineteenth century. Dost Mohammed Khan's support of the Sikhs was cautious, but when 3,500 Afghan horsemen approached the vital fort of Attock on the Indus River, its garrison of Muslim troops installed earlier by Nicholson defected. This allowed Chattar Singh to move out of Hazara and march west and then south, intending to link up with Sher Singh's army. Dalhousie had earlier ordered Gough to halt operations while waiting for Multan to fall, which would allow Whish to reinforce him. Learning of the fall of Attock, he instead ordered Gough to destroy Sher Singh's army before Chattar Singh could join him.\n\nGough unexpectedly encountered Sher Singh's position near the [[Jhelum River]] on 13 January 1849. Sher Singh had cunningly concealed his army, and Gough was faced with the choice of withdrawing, or attacking when it was late in the day. Gough unhesitatingly took the latter course. The resulting [[Battle of Chillianwala]] was desperately fought. Gough's troops, attacking into thick scrub without effective artillery support, suffered heavy losses. Some units lost their colours (which was regarded as a disgrace) and part of one British cavalry regiment fled in panic, resulting in the loss of four guns, also reckoned a humiliation. Sher Singh's army was also hard hit, losing twelve of its own guns.\n\nThree days of heavy rain followed, discouraging both sides from renewing battle. After both armies had faced each other for three days without renewing the action, both withdrew. Sher Singh continued northwards to join Chattar Singh, which made the battle into a strategic British defeat.\n\nThere was much alarm at the losses Gough had suffered. His tactics were severely criticised and he was replaced by General [[Charles James Napier]], although the order did not arrive until after hostilities had ceased.<ref>James 1997, p. 117</ref> Some junior officers reckoned that the true cause of the setback lay lower down the ranks. Promotion in both the British and Bengal armies came slowly, and by the time officers were appointed to command regiments and brigades, they were too old, and worn out by harsh climate and disease. At Chillianwala, several senior officers had proved unable to command their units effectively.<ref>Allen 2000, p.192</ref>\n\n===Last battles===\n[[File:The Battle of Gujrat.jpg|thumb|400px|The [[Battle of Gujrat]], the most decisive battle of the second Anglo-Sikh war]]\nMeanwhile, Whish's force completed their siege works around Multan, their batteries opened fire and made a breach in the defences, which the infantry stormed. Mulraj surrendered on 22 January. He was imprisoned for the remainder of his life. The ending of the siege allowed Whish to reinforce Gough. In particular, Whish's division had large numbers of heavy guns, which the Sikhs lacked.\n\nAs Gough's army closed in on the Sikh Army, Sher Singh attempted a last outflanking move, sending cavalry to cross the Chenab, and re-cross in Gough's rear. They were thwarted by heavy rains which made the river difficult to cross, and by British irregular cavalry led by [[Harry Burnett Lumsden]] and [[William Stephen Raikes Hodson|William Hodson]]. On 13 February, Gough attacked the Sikh Army at the [[Battle of Gujrat]]. Here, he began the battle with a three-hour bombardment from almost 100 guns, which drove the Sikhs from their hasty entrenchments. He then sent his cavalry and horse artillery after them in a pursuit which lasted for four hours.\n\nOn 12 March, Chattar Singh and Sher Singh surrendered near Rawalpindi. Some 20,000 men (mainly irregular cavalry) laid down their arms. The Afghan contingent hastily withdrew through Attock and Peshawar, which the British reoccupied. Dost Mohammed Khan later signed a treaty acknowledging British possession of these cities.\n\nOn 30 March, Duleep Singh held his last court at Lahore, at which he signed away all claims to the rule of the Punjab. A proclamation by Dalhousie, annexing the Punjab, was then read out. For his services the Earl of Dalhousie received the thanks of the British parliament and a step in the peerage, as Marquess. Gough also received rewards for his services, although his tactics at Chillianwala were to be questioned for the remainder of his life. Many of the junior British Political Agents who had organised local resistance to the Sikh Armies were to have distinguished later careers.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Sikh defeat had resulted from several causes.

The latter flows into Turnagain Arm from the northern side. The mountains at its head are high and rugged and form the divide between the waters that flow to Turnagain Arm and those tributary to [[Knik Arm]]. They are broken at the head of Crow Creek by Crow Creek Pass at an altitude of about {{convert|3400|feet}}, which affords a fairly good route from Crow Creek to Raven Creek, a tributary of [[Eagle River (Cook Inlet)|Eagle River]]. From its source in the pass to its mouth, Crow Creek is about {{convert|5|miles}} long. Near its head, it is precipitous, descending in waterfalls and rapids for a vertical distance of over {{convert|1000|feet}} within {{convert|1|mile}} of the pass. It is fed by several small glaciers, and during the summer its waters are turbid. Below the pass the stream emerges from its narrow stream-cut gorge into a gravel-filled basin.\n\nThe basin is bordered at its lower end by a terminal moraine from a lateral valley, and the gravel fill is the result of the lessened gradient behind this morainal dam. Through its boulder-like channel across the moraine the stream descends in rapids, to emerge into a narrow gravel-floored valley bordered by benchlike terraces of gravel and snowing no rock outcrops. These conditions prevail to a point within half a mile of the mouth of the valley, where the stream enters a rock canyon, with nearly vertical walls, that extends to its mouth. Throughout the basin of Crow Creek, the bedrock consists predominantly of interbedded argillites or shales and graywackes, with some conglomerates, cut by numerous granitic dikes and sills. Locally, the shale beds have been metamorphosed, with the development of slaty cleavage, and in places the metamorphism has been intense enough to produce a somewhat schistose structure. The prevailing strike of the beds in this basin is northeast, but locally the beds diverge considerably from this general trend. Near the mouth of Crow Creek, they dip prevailingly at high angles to the southeast, but at the head of the valley folding has occurred, and the general trend of the structure swings around to an easterly direction.<ref name=USGS1917 />\n\n==Physiography==\nThe physiographic history of Crow Creek is highly complex, but the deep excavations made during the progress of mining have yielded much valuable information concerning it. <ref name=\"USGS1917\">{{cite book|author=United States Geological Survey|title=Bulletin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vn4lAQAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA174|edition=Public domain|year=1917|publisher=The Survey|pages=174\u2013}}</ref>\n\n==Geologic history==\nDuring the general retreat of the ice following the intense glaciation of the region, the Crow and Glacier creek glaciers separated. The Crow Creek glacier retreated the more rapidly because of its smaller area of ice supply, but the Glacier Creek glacier retreated sufficiently to allow the escape of the Crow Creek waters, which cut a gorge of considerable depth in the bedrock. A later advance of the Glacier Creek glacier, accompanied probably by a slight advance of the Crow Creek glacier, pounded the Crow Creek waters with a resultant deposition of their load and the filling of the gorge and of part of the valley with water-laid sediments. With the final retreat of the glaciers to their present position, Crow Creek cut a new channel through the fluvioglacial deposits, deviating somewhat from its former channel and exposing the latter where the channels cross.<ref name=\"MartinJohnson1915\">{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=George Curtis|last2=Johnson|first2=Bertrand Leroy|last3=Grant|first3=Ulysses Sherman|title=Geology and Mineral Resources of Kenai Peninsula, Alaska|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LqkPAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA191|edition=Public domain|year=1915|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|pages=191\u2013}}</ref>\n\n==Mining==\n{{Infobox NRHP\n  | name = Crow Creek Consolidated Gold Mining Company\n  | nrhp_type = \n  | image = CROW CREEK CONSOLIDATED GOLD MINING COMPANY.jpg\n  | caption = The Crow Creek Mine is located at mile 0.3 of Crow Creek Road, which turns off the Alyeska Highway at mile 0.3.

In the years preceding 1903, most of the mining was done by pick and shovel on the most easily accessible gold-bearing gravels. The ground mined included the so-called Eagan bar, near the mouth of the stream, the present rock canyon, and some of the surface gravels above the canyon. In 1903 and 1904, hydraulic methods were used, but difficulty was experienced in reaching bedrock above the rock canyon. While the early history of this ground is not clear, it is known that eight partners, locally known as the \"Crow Creek boys,\" were mining in 1904 in the vicinity of the rock canyon on the lower portion of the stream, and that late in 1904, an old, deeply filled rock channel lying northeast of the present canyon was discovered.\n\nFrom 1905 to 1914 the efforts of the several companies operating at this place were in large part directed to removing the gravels above and in this old channel for the purpose of obtaining a bedrock drain to the gravel basin above the present canyon. The Crow Creek Consolidated Mining Co. was organized and operated until 1906. In 1907, the property was sold to the Nutter-Dawson Co., and in 1914 this concern was reorganized into the Alaska Crow Creek Mining Co.\n\nThe Alaska Crow Creek Mining Company operated a hydraulic operation. There were approximately 30 creek and bench claims in the group covering several miles of the creek bed. Much of the company's attention was expended in an effort to get the property in a good working condition and it was not until the fall of 1915 that the work was completed. The gravels toward the lower end of the creek, a greater portion of which were comparatively barren, were sluiced out to bedrock and a flume built to bypass the stream around this point. A bedrock flume {{convert|2200|feet}} long, {{convert|5|feet}} wide, and {{convert|5|feet}} deep was built in this cut on a grade of seven inches to the box length ({{convert|12|feet}}). At the intake, the floor of the first box was manganese steel plates. The next seven had railroad iron for riffles and from there. 14-inch sawed, wooden blocks were used. A ditch, about {{convert|1|mile}} long, conveyed the water from the upper portion of Crow Creek to the penstock, which gave a fall of from {{convert|300|-|400|feet}} at the bottom of the pit. The main pipe line is {{convert|2|feet}} in diameter. Several giants wereoperated, according to the stage of the water. The property was equipped with a complete sawmill which furnished lumber for the flume and dwellings.<ref name=\"Mines1913\">{{cite book|author=United States.

Near the mouth of Crow Creek, they dip prevailingly at high angles to the southeast, but at the head of the valley folding has occurred, and the general trend of the structure swings around to an easterly direction.<ref name=USGS1917 />\n\n==Physiography==\nThe physiographic history of Crow Creek is highly complex, but the deep excavations made during the progress of mining have yielded much valuable information concerning it. <ref name=\"USGS1917\">{{cite book|author=United States Geological Survey|title=Bulletin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vn4lAQAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA174|edition=Public domain|year=1917|publisher=The Survey|pages=174\u2013}}</ref>\n\n==Geologic history==\nDuring the general retreat of the ice following the intense glaciation of the region, the Crow and Glacier creek glaciers separated. The Crow Creek glacier retreated the more rapidly because of its smaller area of ice supply, but the Glacier Creek glacier retreated sufficiently to allow the escape of the Crow Creek waters, which cut a gorge of considerable depth in the bedrock. A later advance of the Glacier Creek glacier, accompanied probably by a slight advance of the Crow Creek glacier, pounded the Crow Creek waters with a resultant deposition of their load and the filling of the gorge and of part of the valley with water-laid sediments. With the final retreat of the glaciers to their present position, Crow Creek cut a new channel through the fluvioglacial deposits, deviating somewhat from its former channel and exposing the latter where the channels cross.<ref name=\"MartinJohnson1915\">{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=George Curtis|last2=Johnson|first2=Bertrand Leroy|last3=Grant|first3=Ulysses Sherman|title=Geology and Mineral Resources of Kenai Peninsula, Alaska|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LqkPAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA191|edition=Public domain|year=1915|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|pages=191\u2013}}</ref>\n\n==Mining==\n{{Infobox NRHP\n  | name = Crow Creek Consolidated Gold Mining Company\n  | nrhp_type = \n  | image = CROW CREEK CONSOLIDATED GOLD MINING COMPANY.jpg\n  | caption = The Crow Creek Mine is located at mile 0.3 of Crow Creek Road, which turns off the Alyeska Highway at mile 0.3.

In the years preceding 1903, most of the mining was done by pick and shovel on the most easily accessible gold-bearing gravels. The ground mined included the so-called Eagan bar, near the mouth of the stream, the present rock canyon, and some of the surface gravels above the canyon. In 1903 and 1904, hydraulic methods were used, but difficulty was experienced in reaching bedrock above the rock canyon. While the early history of this ground is not clear, it is known that eight partners, locally known as the \"Crow Creek boys,\" were mining in 1904 in the vicinity of the rock canyon on the lower portion of the stream, and that late in 1904, an old, deeply filled rock channel lying northeast of the present canyon was discovered.\n\nFrom 1905 to 1914 the efforts of the several companies operating at this place were in large part directed to removing the gravels above and in this old channel for the purpose of obtaining a bedrock drain to the gravel basin above the present canyon. The Crow Creek Consolidated Mining Co. was organized and operated until 1906. In 1907, the property was sold to the Nutter-Dawson Co., and in 1914 this concern was reorganized into the Alaska Crow Creek Mining Co.\n\nThe Alaska Crow Creek Mining Company operated a hydraulic operation. There were approximately 30 creek and bench claims in the group covering several miles of the creek bed. Much of the company's attention was expended in an effort to get the property in a good working condition and it was not until the fall of 1915 that the work was completed. The gravels toward the lower end of the creek, a greater portion of which were comparatively barren, were sluiced out to bedrock and a flume built to bypass the stream around this point. A bedrock flume {{convert|2200|feet}} long, {{convert|5|feet}} wide, and {{convert|5|feet}} deep was built in this cut on a grade of seven inches to the box length ({{convert|12|feet}}). At the intake, the floor of the first box was manganese steel plates. The next seven had railroad iron for riffles and from there. 14-inch sawed, wooden blocks were used. A ditch, about {{convert|1|mile}} long, conveyed the water from the upper portion of Crow Creek to the penstock, which gave a fall of from {{convert|300|-|400|feet}} at the bottom of the pit. The main pipe line is {{convert|2|feet}} in diameter. Several giants wereoperated, according to the stage of the water. The property was equipped with a complete sawmill which furnished lumber for the flume and dwellings.<ref name=\"Mines1913\">{{cite book|author=United States.
