This will help determine the accuracy and effectiveness of various instruments that survey [[Geology of Mars|Martian geology]] from orbit.\n* Search for iron-containing minerals, identify and quantify relative amounts of specific mineral types that contain water or were formed in water, such as iron-bearing carbonates.\n* Characterize the [[mineralogy]] and textures of rocks and soils and determine the processes that created them.\n* Search for geological clues to the [[Environmental science|environmental conditions]] that existed when liquid water was present.\n* Assess whether those environments were conducive to life.\n\nNASA sought evidence of life on Mars, beginning with the question of whether the Martian environment was ever suitable for life. Life forms known to science require water, so the history of [[water on Mars]] is a critical piece of knowledge. Although the Mars Exploration Rovers did not have the ability to detect life directly, they offered very important information on the habitability of the environment during the planet's history.\n\n==Design and construction==\n\n[[File:Mars Exploration Rover.jpg|thumb|right|Annotated rover diagram]]\n[[File:MER Spirit Lander Pan Sol16-A18R1 br2.jpg|thumb|right|''Spirit'' rover images its lander on the surface of Mars on January 18/19, 2004 (''Spirit'' Sol 16)<ref>[http://marsrover.nasa.gov/gallery/press/spirit/20040121a.html NASA.gov], MER-A 20040121a</ref>]]\n[[File:Spirit rock abrasion tool.jpg|thumb|The piece of metal with the American flag on Spirit's rock abrasion tool is made of aluminum recovered from the site of the World Trade Center towers.]]\n{{main|Mars Exploration Rover}}\n{{see also|Comparison of embedded computer systems on board the Mars rovers}}\n\n''Spirit'' (and its twin, ''[[Opportunity rover|Opportunity]]'') are six-wheeled, [[solar panel|solar-powered]] robots standing {{convert|1.5|m|ft|sp=us}} high, {{convert|2.3|m|ft|sp=us}} wide and {{convert|1.6|m|ft|sp=us}} long and weighing {{convert|180|kg|lb}}.

It was the highest resolution image taken on the surface of another planet. According to the camera designer Jim Bell of [[Cornell University]], the panoramic mosaic consists of four pancam images high by three wide. The picture shown originally had a full size of 4,000 by 3,000 [[pixels]]. However, a complete pancam panorama is even 8 times larger than that, and could be taken in stereo (i.e., two complete pictures, making the resolution twice as large again.) The colors are fairly accurate. (For a technical explanation, see [http://areo.info/mer/ colors outside the range of the human eye].)\n\nThe MER pancams are black-and-white instruments. Thirteen rotating filter wheels produce multiple images of the same scene at different wavelengths. Once received on Earth, these images can be combined to produce color images.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lyle.org/~markoff/methods.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050424065044/http://www.lyle.org/~markoff/methods.html|url-status=dead|title=MER color imagery, methods|archivedate=April 24, 2005}}</ref>\n\n==== Sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|01|21}} flash memory management anomaly ====\nOn January 21, 2004 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|01|21}}), ''Spirit'' abruptly ceased communicating with mission control. The next day the rover radioed a 7.8 bit/s beep, confirming that it had received a transmission from Earth but indicating that the craft believed it was in a fault mode. Commands would only be responded to intermittently. This was described as a very serious anomaly, but potentially recoverable if it were a software or memory corruption issue rather than a serious hardware failure. ''Spirit'' was commanded to transmit engineering data, and on January 23 sent several short low-bitrate messages before finally transmitting 73 megabits via [[X band]] to ''[[Mars Odyssey]]''. The readings from the engineering data suggested that the rover was not staying in sleep mode. As such, it was wasting its battery energy and overheating \u2013 risk factors that could potentially destroy the rover if not fixed soon. On sol 20, the command team sent it the command SHUTDWN_DMT_TIL (\"Shutdown Dammit Until\") to try to cause it to suspend itself until a given time. It seemingly ignored the command.\n\nThe leading theory at the time was that the rover was stuck in a \"reboot loop\". The rover was programmed to reboot if there was a fault aboard. However, if there was a fault that occurred during reboot, it would continue to reboot forever. The fact that the problem persisted through reboot suggested that the error was not in RAM, but in either the [[flash memory]], the [[EEPROM]], or a hardware fault. The last case would likely doom the rover. Anticipating the potential for errors in the flash memory and EEPROM, the designers had made it so that the rover could be booted without ever touching the flash memory. The radio itself could decode a limited command set \u2013 enough to tell the rover to reboot without using flash. Without access to flash memory the reboot cycle was broken.\n\nOn January 24, 2004 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|01|24}}) the rover repair team announced that the problem was with ''Spirit'''s flash memory and the software that wrote to it. The flash hardware was believed to be working correctly but the file management module in the software was \"not robust enough\" for the operations the ''Spirit'' was engaged in when the problem occurred, indicating that the problem was caused by a software bug as opposed to faulty hardware. NASA engineers finally came to the conclusion that there were too many files on the file system, which was a relatively minor problem. Most of these files contained unneeded in-flight data. After realizing what the problem was, the engineers deleted some files, and eventually reformatted the entire flash memory system. On February 6 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|02|06}}), the rover was restored to its original working condition, and science activities resumed.<ref name=\"planetary\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20110719212649/http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00000702/ Planetary Blog].</ref>\n\n==== First intentional grinding of a rock on Mars ====\n[[File:Rat post grind.jpg|thumb|right|Digital camera (the [[Pancam]]) image of a Mars rock (called [[Adirondack (Mars)|Adirondack]]) taken after a [[Rock Abrasion Tool|RAT]] grind (the rock grinding tool)]]\nFor the first intentional grinding of a rock on Mars, the ''Spirit'' team chose a rock called \"[[Adirondack (Mars)|Adirondack]]\". To make the drive there, the rover turned 40 degrees in short arcs totaling {{convert|95|cm}}. It then turned in place to face the target rock and drove four short moves straightforward totaling {{cvt|1.9|m}}. Adirondack was chosen over another rock called \"Sashimi\", which was closer to the rover, as Adirondack's surface was smoother, making it more suitable for the [[Rock Abrasion Tool]] (aka \"RAT\").<ref>{{cite press release |last=Webster |first=Guy |date=January 19, 2004 |title=Spirit Drives to a Rock Called 'Adirondack' for Close Inspection |url=https://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mer/newsroom/pressreleases/20040119a.html |publisher=NASA |access-date=2018-01-02}}</ref>\n\n''Spirit'' made a small depression in the rock, {{convert|45.5|mm}} in diameter and {{convert|2.65|mm}} deep.

Raymond Arvidson, the McDonnell University Professor and chair of Earth and Planetary Sciences at [[Washington University in St. Louis]], reported during a NASA press conference: \"If we found this rock on Earth, we would say it is a volcanic rock that had a little fluid moving through it.\" In contrast to the rocks found by the twin rover ''Opportunity'', this one was formed from [[magma]] and then acquired bright material in small crevices, which look like crystallized minerals. If this interpretation holds true, the minerals were most likely dissolved in water, which was either carried inside the rock or interacted with it at a later stage, after it formed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20040305a.html|title=Mars Exploration Rover|last=mars.nasa.gov|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref>\n\n==== Bonneville crater ====\nOn sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|03|11}} March 11, 2004, ''Spirit'' reached [[Bonneville (crater)|Bonneville crater]] after a {{convert|400|yd|m|adj=on|sp=us}} journey.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} This crater is about {{convert|200|m|yd|sp=us}} across with a floor about {{convert|10|m|yd|sp=us}} [[Crater depth|below]] the surface.<ref>{{cite web |title=Surfical geology of the Spirit rover traverse in Gusev Crater: dry and desiccating since the Hesperian |url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/earlymars2004/pdf/8055.pdf |conference=Second Conference on Early Mars (2004) |accessdate=January 26, 2009 |author=Golombek|page=1 |quote=The rim is ~{{convert|3|m|ft|sp=us}} high and although the crater is shallow (~{{convert|10|m|ft|sp=us}} deep)|display-authors=etal}}</ref> JPL decided that it would be a bad idea to send the rover down into the crater, as they saw no targets of interest inside. ''Spirit'' drove along the southern rim and continued to the southwest towards the Columbia Hills.\n{{wide image|PIA05591 Spirit's Destination (panorama).jpg|800px|Bonneville Crater}}\n\n''Spirit'' reached Missoula crater on sol 105. The crater is roughly {{convert|100|yd|m|sp=us}} across and {{convert|20|yd|m|sp=us}} deep. Missoula crater was not considered a high priority target due to the older rocks it contained. The rover skirted the northern rim, and continued to the southeast.\nIt then reached Lahontan crater on sol 118, and drove along the rim until sol 120. Lahontan is about {{convert|60|yd|m|sp=us}} across and about {{convert|10|yd|m|sp=us}} deep. A long, snaking sand dune stretches away from its southwestern side, and ''Spirit'' went around it, because loose sand dunes present an unknown risk to the ability of the rover wheels to get traction.\n\n==== Columbia Hills ====\n''Spirit'' drove from Bonneville crater in a direct line to the Columbia Hills. The route was only directly controlled by the engineers when the terrain was difficult to navigate; otherwise, the rover drove in an autonomous mode. On sol 159, ''Spirit'' reached the first of many targets at the base of the [[Columbia Hills (Mars)|Columbia Hills]] called West Spur. Hank's Hollow was studied for 23 sols. Within Hank's Hollow was the strange-looking rock dubbed \"[[Pot of Gold (Mars)|Pot of Gold]]\". Analysing this rock was difficult for Spirit, because it lay in a slippery area. After a detailed analysis with the AXPS-and the M\u00f6\u00dfbauer instrument it was detected that it contains hematite.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2004-161 | title = Mars Rovers Surprises Continue | work = JPL website | accessdate = 2006-10-06}}</ref> This kind of rock can  be built in connection with water.\n\nAs the produced energy from the solar panels was lowering due to the setting sun and dust the Deep Sleep Mode was introduced. In this mode the rover was shut down completely during the night in order to save energy, even if the instruments would fail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll_2004.html#sol171|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref> The route was selected so that the rover's panels were tilted as much as possible towards the winter sun.\n\nFrom here, ''Spirit'' took a northerly path along the base of the hill towards the target Wooly Patch, which was studied from sol 192 to sol 199. By sol 203, ''Spirit'' had driven southward up the hill and arrived at the rock dubbed \"Clovis\". Clovis was ground and analyzed from sol 210 to sol 225. Following Clovis came the targets of Ebenezer (Sols 226\u2013235), Tetl (sol 270), Uchben and Palinque (Sols 281\u2013295), and Lutefisk (Sols 296\u2013303). From Sols 239 to 262, ''Spirit'' powered down for [[solar conjunction]], when communications with the Earth are blocked. Slowly, ''Spirit'' made its way around the summit of Husband Hill, and at sol 344 was ready to climb over the newly designated \"Cumberland Ridge\" and into \"[[Larry's Lookout]]\" and \"Tennessee Valley\". ''Spirit'' also did some communication tests with the ESA orbiter ''[[Mars Express]]'' though most of the communication was usually done with the NASA orbiters ''[[2001 Mars Odyssey|Mars Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Mars Global Surveyor]]''.\n\n=== 2005 ===\n\n==== Driving up to Husband Hill ====\n''Spirit'' had now been on Mars for one Earth year and was driving slowly uphill towards the top of Husband Hill. This was difficult because there were many rocky obstacles and sandy parts. This lead frequently to a slippage and the route could not be driven as planned. In February ''Spirit'''s computer received a software update in order to drive more autonomously.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll_2005.html#sol416|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref> On sol 371, ''Spirit'' arrived at a rock named \"Peace\" near the top of Cumberland Ridge. ''Spirit'' ground ''Peace'' with the RAT on sol 373. By sol 390 (mid-February 2005), ''Spirit'' was advancing towards \"Larry's Lookout\", by driving up the hill in reverse. The scientists at this time were trying to conserve as much energy as possible for the climb.\n\n''Spirit'' also investigated some targets along the way, including the soil target, \"Paso Robles\", which contained the highest amount of salt found on the red planet. The soil also contained a high amount of [[phosphorus]] in its composition, however not nearly as high as another rock sampled by ''Spirit'', \"Wishstone\". Squyres said of the discovery, \"We're still trying to work out what this means, but clearly, with this much salt around, water had a hand here\".\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nImage:Pot of gold-Close-med.jpg|[[Pot of Gold (Mars)|Pot of Gold rock]]\nImage:Gusev - Colina Husband.jpg|''Spirit'''s traverse up Husband Hill\nImage:Spirit PIA03230.jpg|''Spirit'' artificially added to image (taken by itself) of Larry's Lookout\nImage:MarsSunset.jpg|Martian sunset by ''Spirit'' at Gusev crater, May 19, 2005.\n</gallery>\n\n==== Dust devils ====\nOn March 9, 2005 (probably during the Martian night), the rover's solar panel efficiency jumped from the original ~60%  to 93%, followed on March 10, by the sighting of [[dust devils]]. NASA scientists speculate a dust devil must have swept the solar panels clean, possibly significantly extending the duration of the mission. This also marks the first time dust devils had been spotted by ''Spirit'' or ''Opportunity'', and is easily one of the top highlights of the mission to date. Dust devils had previously only been photographed by the ''[[Mars Pathfinder|Pathfinder]]'' probe.\n\nMission members monitoring ''Spirit'' on Mars reported on March 12, 2005 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2005|03|12}}), that a lucky encounter with a dust devil had cleaned the robot's solar panels. Energy levels dramatically increased and daily science work was anticipated to be expanded.<ref>{{cite web | last = David | first = Leonard | date = March 12, 2005 | url = http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/spirit_dust_050312.html | title = Spirit Gets A Dust Devil Once-Over | publisher = Space.com | accessdate =December 1, 2006}}</ref>\n \n[[File:Marsdustdevil2.gif|thumb|center|800px|Video of a dust devil on Mars, photographed by ''Spirit''.

Here it was found that Husband Hill has two summits, with one a little higher than the other. On August 21 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2005|08|24}})<ref>{{cite web |title=Rover Update: 2005: All |url=https://mars.nasa.gov/mer/mission/rover-status/spirit/2005/all/#sol579 |website=mars.nasa.gov |accessdate=23 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref>, ''Spirit'' reached the real summit of Husband Hill. The rover was the first spacecraft to climb atop a mountain on another planet. The whole distance driven totaled 4971 meters.\nThe summit itself was flat. ''Spirit'' took a 360 degree panorama in real color, which included the whole Gusev crater. At night the rover observed the moons [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] and [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]] in order to determine their orbits better.<ref name=\"nasa_2010_189\">{{cite web \n|authors=Staff |title=NASA Rover Finds Clue to Mars' Past And Environment for Life |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/news/mer20100603.html |work=[[NASA]] |date=2010-06-03 |accessdate=2011-05-25}}</ref> On sol 656 ''Spirit'' surveyed the Mars sky and the opacity of the atmosphere with its pancam to make a coordinated science campaign with the Hubble Space Telescope in Earth orbit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll_2005.html#sol655|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref>\n\nFrom the peak ''Spirit'' spotted a striking formation, which was dubbed \"Home Plate\". This was an interesting target, but ''Spirit'' would be driven later to the McCool Hill to tilt its solar panels towards the sun in the coming winter. At the end of October the rover was driven downhill and to Home Plate. On the way down ''Spirit'' reached the rock formation named \"Comanche\" on sol 690. Scientists used data from all three spectrometers to find out that about one-fourth of the composition of Comanche is magnesium iron carbonate. That concentration is 10 times higher than for any previously identified carbonate in a Martian rock. Carbonates originate in wet, near-neutral conditions but dissolve in acid. The find at Comanche is the first unambiguous evidence from the Mars Exploration Mission rovers for a past Martian environment that may have been more favorable to life than the wet but acidic conditions indicated by the rovers' earlier finds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/multimedia/gallery/comanche-no-label.html|title=NASA \u2013 Carbonate-Containing Martian Rocks (False Color)|website=www.nasa.gov}}</ref>\n\n{{Wide image|Everest Panorama from Mars.jpg|1100px|View from the Summit taken by ''Spirit'' on August 23, 2005, as the rover completed the climb up Husband Hill.}}\n\n=== 2006 ===\n\n==== Driving to McCool Hill ====\nIn 2006 ''Spirit'' drove towards an area dubbed Home Plate, and reached it in February. For events in 2006 by NASA see [http://marsrover.nasa.gov/mission/status_spirit_2006.html NASA Spirit Archive 2006]\n\n''Spirit's'' next stop was originally planned to be the north face of [[McCool Hill]], where ''Spirit'' would receive adequate sunlight during the Martian winter. On March 16, 2006 JPL announced that ''Spirit's'' troublesome front wheel had stopped working altogether. Despite this, ''Spirit'' was still making progress toward McCool Hill because the control team programmed the rover to drive toward McCool Hill backwards, dragging its broken wheel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll.html#sol778|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref>  In late March, ''Spirit'' encountered loose soil that was impeding its progress toward McCool Hill. A decision was made to terminate attempts to reach McCool Hill and instead park on a nearby ridge named Low Ridge Haven.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right \n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Home plate anim.gif\n| width1    = {{#expr: (130 * 331 / 285 ) round 0}}\n| alt1      = \n| caption1  = Curious rock near edge of \"Home Plate\" with a jutting portion.

The rover made its first drive, a short turn to position targets of interest within reach of the robotic arm, in early November 2006, following the shortest days of winter and solar conjunction when communications with Earth were severely limited.\n\nWhile at Low Ridge, ''Spirit'' imaged two rocks of similar chemical nature to that of ''Opportunity'''s [[Heat Shield Rock]], a [[meteorite]] on the surface of Mars. Named \"Zhong Shan\" for [[Sun Yat-sen]] and \"Allan Hills\" for the [[Allan Hills|location]] in [[Antarctica]] where several Martian meteorites have been found, they stood out against the background rocks that were darker. Further spectrographic testing is being done to determine the exact composition of these rocks, which may turn out to also be meteorites.\n\n=== 2007 ===\n\n==== Software upgrade ====\nOn January 4, 2007 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2007|01|04}}), both rovers received new flight software to the onboard computers. The update was received just in time for the third anniversary of their landing. The new systems let the rovers decide whether or not to transmit an image, and whether or not to extend their arms to examine rocks, which would save much time for scientists as they would not have to sift through hundreds of images to find the one they want, or examine the surroundings to decide to extend the arms and examine the rocks.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2007/01/04/tech-mars.html | work=CBC News | title=Old rovers learn new tricks | date=January 4, 2007}}</ref>\n\n====Silica Valley====\n[[File:Spirit Mars Silica April 20 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Rover exposes silica-rich dust]]\n''Spirit'''s dead wheel turned out to have a silver lining. As it was traveling in March 2007, pulling the dead wheel behind, the wheel scraped off the upper layer of the Martian soil, uncovering a patch of ground that scientists say shows evidence of a past environment that would have been perfect for microbial life. It is similar to areas on Earth where water or steam from hot springs came into contact with volcanic rocks. On Earth, these are locations that tend to teem with bacteria, said rover chief scientist [[Steve Squyres]]. \"We're really excited about this,\" he told a meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU). The area is extremely rich in [[Silicon dioxide|silica]]\u2013the main ingredient of window glass. The researchers have now concluded that the bright material must have been produced in one of two ways. One: hot-spring deposits produced when water dissolved silica at one location and then carried it to another (i.e. a geyser). Two: acidic steam rising through cracks in rocks  stripped them of their mineral components, leaving silica behind. \"The important thing is that whether it is one hypothesis or the other, the implications for the former habitability of Mars are pretty much the same,\" Squyres explained to BBC News. Hot water provides an environment in which [[microbe]]s can thrive and the precipitation of that silica entombs and preserves them. Squyres added, \"You can go to [[hot spring]]s and you can go to [[fumarole]]s and at either place on Earth it is teeming with life \u2013 [[Microorganism|microbial life]].\"<ref name=\"Amos\">{{cite news  | last = Amos  | first = Jonathan    | title = Mars robot unearths microbe clue   | work = NASA says its robot rover Spirit has made one of its most significant discoveries on the surface of Mars. |publisher=BBC News  | date = December 11, 2007 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7137793.stm  | accessdate =December 12, 2007 }}</ref><ref name=\"20071210a\">{{cite web  | last = Bertster  | first =  Guy   | title = Mars Rover Investigates Signs of Steamy Martian Past  | work = Press Release  | publisher = Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California  | date = December 10, 2007  | url = http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20071210a.html  | accessdate =December 12, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==== Global dust storm and Home Plate ====\nDuring 2007 ''Spirit'' spent several months near the base of the Home Plate plateau. On sol 1306 ''Spirit'' climbed onto the eastern edge of the plateau. In September and October it examined rocks and soils at several locations on the southern half of the plateau. On November 6, ''Spirit'' had reached the western edge of Home Plate, and started taking pictures for a panoramic overview of the western valley, with Grissom Hill and Husband Hill visible. The panorama image was published on NASA's website on January 3, 2008 to little attention, until January 23, when an independent website published a magnified detail of the image that showed a rock feature a few centimeters high resembling a humanoid figure seen from the side with its right arm partially raised.<ref>[http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00001305/ Planetary.org] Emily Lakdawalla, ''Teeny little Bigfoot on Mars'', January 23, 2008 | 12:41 PST | 20:41 UTC</ref><ref>{{Cite APOD |date=January 29, 2008 |title=Spirit's West Valley Panorama image |access-date=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Mars Spirit rover's solar panels covered with Dust - October 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Circular projection showing ''Spirit'''s solar panels covered in dust \u2013 October 2007]]\nTowards the end of June 2007, a series of dust storms began clouding the Martian atmosphere with dust. The storms intensified and by July 20, both ''Spirit'' and ''Opportunity'' were facing the real possibility of system failure due to lack of energy. NASA released a statement to the press that said (in part) \"We're rooting for our rovers to survive these storms, but they were never designed for conditions this intense\".<ref>{{Cite press| url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2007-080| accessdate=August 21, 2009| title=NASA Mars Rovers Braving Severe Dust Storms| date=July 27, 2007| publisher=[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]}}</ref> The key problem caused by the dust storms was a dramatic reduction in solar energy caused by there being so much dust in the atmosphere that it was blocking 99 percent of direct sunlight to ''Opportunity'', and slightly more to ''Spirit''.\n\nNormally the solar arrays on the rovers are able to generate up to {{Convert|700|Wh}} of energy per [[Martian day]]. After the storms, the amount of energy generated was greatly reduced to {{Convert|128|Wh}}. If the rovers generate less than {{Convert|150|Wh}} per day they must start draining their batteries to run survival heaters. If the batteries run dry, key electrical elements are likely to fail due to the intense cold. Both rovers were put into the lowest-power setting in order to wait out the storms. In early August the storms began to clear slightly, allowing the rovers to successfully charge their batteries. They were kept in hibernation in order to wait out the remainder of the storm.<ref>{{Cite press| url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20070807a.html| accessdate=August 21, 2009| title=Martian Skies Brighten Slightly| date=August 7, 2007| publisher=[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]}}</ref>\n\n=== 2008 ===\n\n==== Hibernating ====\nThe main concern was the energy level for ''Spirit''. To increase the amount of light hitting the solar panels, the rover was parked in the northern part of Home Plate on as steep a slope as possible. It was expected that the level of dust cover on the solar panels would increase by 70 percent and that a slope of 30 degrees would be necessary to survive the winter. In February, a tilt of 29.9 degrees was achieved. Extra energy was available at times, and a high definition panorama named ''Bonestell'' was produced. At other times when there was only enough solar energy to recharge the batteries, communication with Earth was minimized and all unnecessary instruments were switched off. At winter solstice the energy production declined to 235 watt hours per sol.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll_2008.html|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref>\n\n==== Winter dust storm ====\nOn November 10, 2008, a large dust storm further reduced the output of the solar panels to {{Convert|89|Wh}} per day\u2014a critically low level.<ref>{{Cite press| url=http://marsrovers.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20081110a.html |accessdate=August 21, 2009|title=Dust Storm Cuts Energy Supply of NASA Mars Rover Spirit| date= November 10, 2008| publisher=[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]}}</ref> NASA officials were hopeful that ''Spirit'' would survive the storm, and that the energy level would rise once the storm had passed and the skies started clearing.

It is also possible that the rover had experienced a mission clock fault. If that had happened, the rover would have lost track of time and tried to remain asleep until enough sunlight struck the solar arrays to wake it. This state is called \"Solar Groovy.\" If the rover woke up from a mission clock fault, it would only listen. Starting on July 26, 2010 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2010|07|26}}), a new procedure to address the possible mission clock fault was implemented.\n\nEach sol, the Deep Space Network mission controllers sent a set of X-band \"Sweep & Beep\" commands. If the rover had experienced a mission clock fault and then had been awoken during the day, it would have listened during brief, 20-minute intervals during each hour awake. Due to the possible clock fault, the timing of these 20-minute listening intervals was not known, so multiple \"Sweep & Beep\" commands were sent. If the rover heard one of these commands, it would have responded with an X-band beep signal, updating the mission controllers on its status and allowing them to investigate the state of the rover further.

These rocks can be classified in different ways. The amounts and types of minerals make the rocks primitive basalts\u2014also called picritic basalts. The rocks are similar to ancient terrestrial rocks called basaltic [[komatiites]]. Rocks of the plains also resemble the basaltic [[shergottite]]s, meteorites that came from Mars. One classification system compares the amount of alkali elements to the amount of silica on a graph; in this system, Gusev plains rocks lie near the junction of basalt, [[picrobasalt]], and [[tephrite]]. The Irvine-Barager classification calls them basalts.<ref name=\"McSween2004\" />\nPlains rocks have been very slightly altered, probably by thin films of water because they are softer and contain veins of light colored material that may be bromine compounds, as well as coatings or rinds.

Sulfate was found, and it needs water to form. \nWishstone contained a great deal of plagioclase, some olivine, and [[anhydrate]] (a sulfate). Peace rocks showed [[sulfur]] and strong evidence for bound water, so hydrated sulfates are suspected. Watchtower class rocks lack olivine consequently they may have been altered by water. The Independence class showed some signs of clay (perhaps montmorillonite a member of the smectite group). Clays require fairly long term exposure to water to form.\nOne type of soil, called Paso Robles, from the Columbia Hills, may be an evaporate deposit because it contains large amounts of sulfur, [[phosphorus]], [[calcium]], and iron.<ref name=\"Ming2005JE002560\" />\nAlso, MB found that much of the iron in Paso Robles soil was of the oxidized, Fe<sup>3+</sup> form, which would happen if water had been present.<ref name=\"Bell\" />\n\nTowards the middle of the six-year mission (a mission that was supposed to last only 90 days), large amounts of pure [[silica]] were found in the soil.<ref name=\"Sky & Telescope\">{{cite web|url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/news/19177609.html|title=Mars Rover Uncovers Ancient Hot Springs|publisher=SkyandTelescope.com|date=2008-05-22|accessdate=2012-08-01}}</ref>  The silica could have come from the interaction of soil with acid vapors produced by volcanic activity in the presence of water or from water in a hot spring environment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/mer-20070521.html|title=NASA \u2013 Mars Rover Spirit Unearths Surprise Evidence of Wetter Past|website=www.nasa.gov}}</ref>\n\nAfter ''Spirit'' stopped working scientists studied old data from the Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer, or [[Mini-TES]] and confirmed the presence of large amounts of [[carbonate]]-rich rocks, which means that regions of the planet may have once harbored water.

However, in the Columbia Hills there was clear evidence for a moderate amount of aqueous weathering. The evidence included sulfates and the minerals goethite and carbonates that only form in the presence of water. It is believed that Gusev crater may have held a lake long ago, but it has since been covered by igneous materials. All the dust contains a magnetic component that was identified as magnetite with some titanium. Furthermore, the thin coating of dust that covers everything on Mars is the same in all parts of Mars.\n\n==Astronomy==\n{{see also|Astronomy on Mars}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = PIA05547-Spirit Rover-Earth seen from Mars.png\n| width1 = {{#expr: (200 * (1194 / 1007)) round 0}}\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = [[Earth]] from Mars\n| image2 = Phobos & Deimos full thumb.png\n| width2 = {{#expr: (200 * (200 / 213)) round 0}}\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = Night sky of Mars showing [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]] (left) and [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] (right) in front of [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]], as seen by [[Mars Exploration Rover]] ''Spirit'' on August 26, 2005.

It also took the first photo of Earth from the surface of another planet in early March 2004.\n\nIn late 2005, ''Spirit'' took advantage of a favorable energy situation to make multiple nighttime observations of both of Mars' moons [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] and [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]].<ref name=\"pancam\">Jim Bell (Cornell University) et al. [http://pancam.astro.cornell.edu/pancam_instrument/projects_2.html Pancam Projects: Spirit Night-time Imaging]. Retrieved 2008-10-21</ref> These observations included a \"[[lunar eclipse|lunar]]\" (or rather phobian) [[eclipse]] as ''Spirit'' watched Phobos disappear into Mars' shadow. Some of ''Spirit'''s star gazing was designed to look for a predicted [[meteor shower]] caused by [[Halley's Comet]], and although at least four imaged streaks were suspect meteors, they could not be unambiguously differentiated from those caused by cosmic rays.<ref name=\"pancam\" />\n\nA [[transit of Mercury from Mars]] took place on January 12, 2005 from about 14:45 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] to 23:05 UTC. Theoretically, this could have been observed by both ''Spirit'' and ''[[Opportunity rover|Opportunity]]''; however, camera resolution did not permit seeing Mercury's [[Arc second|6.1\"]] angular diameter. They were able to observe transits of [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]] across the Sun, but at [[Arc minute|2']] angular diameter, Deimos is about 20 times larger than Mercury's 6.1\" angular diameter. Ephemeris data generated by [[JPL Horizons]] indicates that ''Opportunity'' would have been able to observe the transit from the start until local sunset at about 19:23 UTC Earth time, while ''Spirit'' would have been able to observe it from local sunrise at about 19:38 UTC until the end of the transit.{{Clarify|date=October 2008}}<!-- the nasa.gov URL does not state any of this; need instructions on how to verify this --><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?horizons|title=HORIZONS System|first=Alan|last=Chamberlin|website=ssd.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref>\n\n==Equipment wear and failures==\nBoth rovers passed their original mission time of 90 sols many times over.

Engineers began driving the rover backwards, dragging the dead wheel. Although this resulted in changes to driving techniques, the dragging effect became a useful tool, partially clearing away soil on the surface as the rover traveled, thus allowing areas to be imaged that would normally be inaccessible. However, in mid-December 2009, to the surprise of the engineers, the right front wheel showed slight movement in a wheel-test on sol 2113 and clearly rotated with normal resistance on three of four wheel-tests on sol 2117, but stalled on the fourth. On November 29, 2009 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2009|11|29}}), the right rear wheel also stalled and remained inoperable for the remainder of the mission.\n\nScientific instruments also experienced degradation as a result of exposure to the harsh Martian environment and use over a far longer period than had been anticipated by the mission planners.

The mission received several extensions and lasted about 2,208 sols. On August 11, 2007, ''Spirit'' obtained the second longest operational duration on the surface of Mars for a lander or rover at 1282 Sols, one sol longer than the [[Viking 2]] lander. Viking 2 was powered by a nuclear cell whereas ''Spirit'' is powered by solar arrays. Until ''Opportunity'' overtook it on May 19, 2010, the Mars probe with longest operational period was [[Viking 1]] that lasted for 2245 Sols on the surface of Mars. On March 22, 2010, ''Spirit'' sent its last communication, thus falling just over a month short of surpassing Viking 1's operational record.

In particular, samples sought will include those that have minerals deposited by water-related processes such as [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], [[Water vapor|evaporation]], [[Sedimentary rock|sedimentary cementation]] or [[hydrothermal activity]].\n* Determine the distribution and composition of minerals, rocks, and soils surrounding the landing sites.\n* Determine what [[Geology of Mars|geologic processes]] have shaped the local terrain and influenced the chemistry. Such processes could include water or wind erosion, sedimentation, hydrothermal mechanisms, volcanism, and cratering.\n* Perform calibration and validation of surface observations made by [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]] instruments. This will help determine the accuracy and effectiveness of various instruments that survey [[Geology of Mars|Martian geology]] from orbit.\n* Search for iron-containing minerals, identify and quantify relative amounts of specific mineral types that contain water or were formed in water, such as iron-bearing carbonates.\n* Characterize the [[mineralogy]] and textures of rocks and soils and determine the processes that created them.\n* Search for geological clues to the [[Environmental science|environmental conditions]] that existed when liquid water was present.\n* Assess whether those environments were conducive to life.\n\nNASA sought evidence of life on Mars, beginning with the question of whether the Martian environment was ever suitable for life. Life forms known to science require water, so the history of [[water on Mars]] is a critical piece of knowledge. Although the Mars Exploration Rovers did not have the ability to detect life directly, they offered very important information on the habitability of the environment during the planet's history.\n\n==Design and construction==\n\n[[File:Mars Exploration Rover.jpg|thumb|right|Annotated rover diagram]]\n[[File:MER Spirit Lander Pan Sol16-A18R1 br2.jpg|thumb|right|''Spirit'' rover images its lander on the surface of Mars on January 18/19, 2004 (''Spirit'' Sol 16)<ref>[http://marsrover.nasa.gov/gallery/press/spirit/20040121a.html NASA.gov], MER-A 20040121a</ref>]]\n[[File:Spirit rock abrasion tool.jpg|thumb|The piece of metal with the American flag on Spirit's rock abrasion tool is made of aluminum recovered from the site of the World Trade Center towers.]]\n{{main|Mars Exploration Rover}}\n{{see also|Comparison of embedded computer systems on board the Mars rovers}}\n\n''Spirit'' (and its twin, ''[[Opportunity rover|Opportunity]]'') are six-wheeled, [[solar panel|solar-powered]] robots standing {{convert|1.5|m|ft|sp=us}} high, {{convert|2.3|m|ft|sp=us}} wide and {{convert|1.6|m|ft|sp=us}} long and weighing {{convert|180|kg|lb}}.

It was the highest resolution image taken on the surface of another planet. According to the camera designer Jim Bell of [[Cornell University]], the panoramic mosaic consists of four pancam images high by three wide. The picture shown originally had a full size of 4,000 by 3,000 [[pixels]]. However, a complete pancam panorama is even 8 times larger than that, and could be taken in stereo (i.e., two complete pictures, making the resolution twice as large again.) The colors are fairly accurate. (For a technical explanation, see [http://areo.info/mer/ colors outside the range of the human eye].)\n\nThe MER pancams are black-and-white instruments. Thirteen rotating filter wheels produce multiple images of the same scene at different wavelengths. Once received on Earth, these images can be combined to produce color images.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lyle.org/~markoff/methods.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050424065044/http://www.lyle.org/~markoff/methods.html|url-status=dead|title=MER color imagery, methods|archivedate=April 24, 2005}}</ref>\n\n==== Sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|01|21}} flash memory management anomaly ====\nOn January 21, 2004 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|01|21}}), ''Spirit'' abruptly ceased communicating with mission control. The next day the rover radioed a 7.8 bit/s beep, confirming that it had received a transmission from Earth but indicating that the craft believed it was in a fault mode. Commands would only be responded to intermittently. This was described as a very serious anomaly, but potentially recoverable if it were a software or memory corruption issue rather than a serious hardware failure. ''Spirit'' was commanded to transmit engineering data, and on January 23 sent several short low-bitrate messages before finally transmitting 73 megabits via [[X band]] to ''[[Mars Odyssey]]''. The readings from the engineering data suggested that the rover was not staying in sleep mode. As such, it was wasting its battery energy and overheating \u2013 risk factors that could potentially destroy the rover if not fixed soon. On sol 20, the command team sent it the command SHUTDWN_DMT_TIL (\"Shutdown Dammit Until\") to try to cause it to suspend itself until a given time. It seemingly ignored the command.\n\nThe leading theory at the time was that the rover was stuck in a \"reboot loop\". The rover was programmed to reboot if there was a fault aboard. However, if there was a fault that occurred during reboot, it would continue to reboot forever. The fact that the problem persisted through reboot suggested that the error was not in RAM, but in either the [[flash memory]], the [[EEPROM]], or a hardware fault. The last case would likely doom the rover. Anticipating the potential for errors in the flash memory and EEPROM, the designers had made it so that the rover could be booted without ever touching the flash memory. The radio itself could decode a limited command set \u2013 enough to tell the rover to reboot without using flash. Without access to flash memory the reboot cycle was broken.\n\nOn January 24, 2004 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|01|24}}) the rover repair team announced that the problem was with ''Spirit'''s flash memory and the software that wrote to it. The flash hardware was believed to be working correctly but the file management module in the software was \"not robust enough\" for the operations the ''Spirit'' was engaged in when the problem occurred, indicating that the problem was caused by a software bug as opposed to faulty hardware. NASA engineers finally came to the conclusion that there were too many files on the file system, which was a relatively minor problem. Most of these files contained unneeded in-flight data. After realizing what the problem was, the engineers deleted some files, and eventually reformatted the entire flash memory system. On February 6 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|02|06}}), the rover was restored to its original working condition, and science activities resumed.<ref name=\"planetary\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20110719212649/http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00000702/ Planetary Blog].</ref>\n\n==== First intentional grinding of a rock on Mars ====\n[[File:Rat post grind.jpg|thumb|right|Digital camera (the [[Pancam]]) image of a Mars rock (called [[Adirondack (Mars)|Adirondack]]) taken after a [[Rock Abrasion Tool|RAT]] grind (the rock grinding tool)]]\nFor the first intentional grinding of a rock on Mars, the ''Spirit'' team chose a rock called \"[[Adirondack (Mars)|Adirondack]]\".

Adirondack was chosen over another rock called \"Sashimi\", which was closer to the rover, as Adirondack's surface was smoother, making it more suitable for the [[Rock Abrasion Tool]] (aka \"RAT\").<ref>{{cite press release |last=Webster |first=Guy |date=January 19, 2004 |title=Spirit Drives to a Rock Called 'Adirondack' for Close Inspection |url=https://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mer/newsroom/pressreleases/20040119a.html |publisher=NASA |access-date=2018-01-02}}</ref>\n\n''Spirit'' made a small depression in the rock, {{convert|45.5|mm}} in diameter and {{convert|2.65|mm}} deep.

Raymond Arvidson, the McDonnell University Professor and chair of Earth and Planetary Sciences at [[Washington University in St. Louis]], reported during a NASA press conference: \"If we found this rock on Earth, we would say it is a volcanic rock that had a little fluid moving through it.\" In contrast to the rocks found by the twin rover ''Opportunity'', this one was formed from [[magma]] and then acquired bright material in small crevices, which look like crystallized minerals. If this interpretation holds true, the minerals were most likely dissolved in water, which was either carried inside the rock or interacted with it at a later stage, after it formed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20040305a.html|title=Mars Exploration Rover|last=mars.nasa.gov|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref>\n\n==== Bonneville crater ====\nOn sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|03|11}} March 11, 2004, ''Spirit'' reached [[Bonneville (crater)|Bonneville crater]] after a {{convert|400|yd|m|adj=on|sp=us}} journey.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} This crater is about {{convert|200|m|yd|sp=us}} across with a floor about {{convert|10|m|yd|sp=us}} [[Crater depth|below]] the surface.<ref>{{cite web |title=Surfical geology of the Spirit rover traverse in Gusev Crater: dry and desiccating since the Hesperian |url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/earlymars2004/pdf/8055.pdf |conference=Second Conference on Early Mars (2004) |accessdate=January 26, 2009 |author=Golombek|page=1 |quote=The rim is ~{{convert|3|m|ft|sp=us}} high and although the crater is shallow (~{{convert|10|m|ft|sp=us}} deep)|display-authors=etal}}</ref> JPL decided that it would be a bad idea to send the rover down into the crater, as they saw no targets of interest inside. ''Spirit'' drove along the southern rim and continued to the southwest towards the Columbia Hills.\n{{wide image|PIA05591 Spirit's Destination (panorama).jpg|800px|Bonneville Crater}}\n\n''Spirit'' reached Missoula crater on sol 105. The crater is roughly {{convert|100|yd|m|sp=us}} across and {{convert|20|yd|m|sp=us}} deep. Missoula crater was not considered a high priority target due to the older rocks it contained. The rover skirted the northern rim, and continued to the southeast.\nIt then reached Lahontan crater on sol 118, and drove along the rim until sol 120. Lahontan is about {{convert|60|yd|m|sp=us}} across and about {{convert|10|yd|m|sp=us}} deep. A long, snaking sand dune stretches away from its southwestern side, and ''Spirit'' went around it, because loose sand dunes present an unknown risk to the ability of the rover wheels to get traction.\n\n==== Columbia Hills ====\n''Spirit'' drove from Bonneville crater in a direct line to the Columbia Hills. The route was only directly controlled by the engineers when the terrain was difficult to navigate; otherwise, the rover drove in an autonomous mode. On sol 159, ''Spirit'' reached the first of many targets at the base of the [[Columbia Hills (Mars)|Columbia Hills]] called West Spur. Hank's Hollow was studied for 23 sols. Within Hank's Hollow was the strange-looking rock dubbed \"[[Pot of Gold (Mars)|Pot of Gold]]\". Analysing this rock was difficult for Spirit, because it lay in a slippery area. After a detailed analysis with the AXPS-and the M\u00f6\u00dfbauer instrument it was detected that it contains hematite.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2004-161 | title = Mars Rovers Surprises Continue | work = JPL website | accessdate = 2006-10-06}}</ref> This kind of rock can  be built in connection with water.\n\nAs the produced energy from the solar panels was lowering due to the setting sun and dust the Deep Sleep Mode was introduced. In this mode the rover was shut down completely during the night in order to save energy, even if the instruments would fail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll_2004.html#sol171|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref> The route was selected so that the rover's panels were tilted as much as possible towards the winter sun.\n\nFrom here, ''Spirit'' took a northerly path along the base of the hill towards the target Wooly Patch, which was studied from sol 192 to sol 199. By sol 203, ''Spirit'' had driven southward up the hill and arrived at the rock dubbed \"Clovis\". Clovis was ground and analyzed from sol 210 to sol 225. Following Clovis came the targets of Ebenezer (Sols 226\u2013235), Tetl (sol 270), Uchben and Palinque (Sols 281\u2013295), and Lutefisk (Sols 296\u2013303). From Sols 239 to 262, ''Spirit'' powered down for [[solar conjunction]], when communications with the Earth are blocked. Slowly, ''Spirit'' made its way around the summit of Husband Hill, and at sol 344 was ready to climb over the newly designated \"Cumberland Ridge\" and into \"[[Larry's Lookout]]\" and \"Tennessee Valley\". ''Spirit'' also did some communication tests with the ESA orbiter ''[[Mars Express]]'' though most of the communication was usually done with the NASA orbiters ''[[2001 Mars Odyssey|Mars Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Mars Global Surveyor]]''.\n\n=== 2005 ===\n\n==== Driving up to Husband Hill ====\n''Spirit'' had now been on Mars for one Earth year and was driving slowly uphill towards the top of Husband Hill. This was difficult because there were many rocky obstacles and sandy parts. This lead frequently to a slippage and the route could not be driven as planned. In February ''Spirit'''s computer received a software update in order to drive more autonomously.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll_2005.html#sol416|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref> On sol 371, ''Spirit'' arrived at a rock named \"Peace\" near the top of Cumberland Ridge. ''Spirit'' ground ''Peace'' with the RAT on sol 373. By sol 390 (mid-February 2005), ''Spirit'' was advancing towards \"Larry's Lookout\", by driving up the hill in reverse. The scientists at this time were trying to conserve as much energy as possible for the climb.\n\n''Spirit'' also investigated some targets along the way, including the soil target, \"Paso Robles\", which contained the highest amount of salt found on the red planet. The soil also contained a high amount of [[phosphorus]] in its composition, however not nearly as high as another rock sampled by ''Spirit'', \"Wishstone\". Squyres said of the discovery, \"We're still trying to work out what this means, but clearly, with this much salt around, water had a hand here\".\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nImage:Pot of gold-Close-med.jpg|[[Pot of Gold (Mars)|Pot of Gold rock]]\nImage:Gusev - Colina Husband.jpg|''Spirit'''s traverse up Husband Hill\nImage:Spirit PIA03230.jpg|''Spirit'' artificially added to image (taken by itself) of Larry's Lookout\nImage:MarsSunset.jpg|Martian sunset by ''Spirit'' at Gusev crater, May 19, 2005.\n</gallery>\n\n==== Dust devils ====\nOn March 9, 2005 (probably during the Martian night), the rover's solar panel efficiency jumped from the original ~60%  to 93%, followed on March 10, by the sighting of [[dust devils]]. NASA scientists speculate a dust devil must have swept the solar panels clean, possibly significantly extending the duration of the mission. This also marks the first time dust devils had been spotted by ''Spirit'' or ''Opportunity'', and is easily one of the top highlights of the mission to date. Dust devils had previously only been photographed by the ''[[Mars Pathfinder|Pathfinder]]'' probe.\n\nMission members monitoring ''Spirit'' on Mars reported on March 12, 2005 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2005|03|12}}), that a lucky encounter with a dust devil had cleaned the robot's solar panels. Energy levels dramatically increased and daily science work was anticipated to be expanded.<ref>{{cite web | last = David | first = Leonard | date = March 12, 2005 | url = http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/spirit_dust_050312.html | title = Spirit Gets A Dust Devil Once-Over | publisher = Space.com | accessdate =December 1, 2006}}</ref>\n \n[[File:Marsdustdevil2.gif|thumb|center|800px|Video of a dust devil on Mars, photographed by ''Spirit''.

Here it was found that Husband Hill has two summits, with one a little higher than the other. On August 21 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2005|08|24}})<ref>{{cite web |title=Rover Update: 2005: All |url=https://mars.nasa.gov/mer/mission/rover-status/spirit/2005/all/#sol579 |website=mars.nasa.gov |accessdate=23 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref>, ''Spirit'' reached the real summit of Husband Hill. The rover was the first spacecraft to climb atop a mountain on another planet. The whole distance driven totaled 4971 meters.\nThe summit itself was flat. ''Spirit'' took a 360 degree panorama in real color, which included the whole Gusev crater. At night the rover observed the moons [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] and [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]] in order to determine their orbits better.<ref name=\"nasa_2010_189\">{{cite web \n|authors=Staff |title=NASA Rover Finds Clue to Mars' Past And Environment for Life |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/news/mer20100603.html |work=[[NASA]] |date=2010-06-03 |accessdate=2011-05-25}}</ref> On sol 656 ''Spirit'' surveyed the Mars sky and the opacity of the atmosphere with its pancam to make a coordinated science campaign with the Hubble Space Telescope in Earth orbit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll_2005.html#sol655|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref>\n\nFrom the peak ''Spirit'' spotted a striking formation, which was dubbed \"Home Plate\". This was an interesting target, but ''Spirit'' would be driven later to the McCool Hill to tilt its solar panels towards the sun in the coming winter. At the end of October the rover was driven downhill and to Home Plate. On the way down ''Spirit'' reached the rock formation named \"Comanche\" on sol 690. Scientists used data from all three spectrometers to find out that about one-fourth of the composition of Comanche is magnesium iron carbonate. That concentration is 10 times higher than for any previously identified carbonate in a Martian rock. Carbonates originate in wet, near-neutral conditions but dissolve in acid. The find at Comanche is the first unambiguous evidence from the Mars Exploration Mission rovers for a past Martian environment that may have been more favorable to life than the wet but acidic conditions indicated by the rovers' earlier finds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/multimedia/gallery/comanche-no-label.html|title=NASA \u2013 Carbonate-Containing Martian Rocks (False Color)|website=www.nasa.gov}}</ref>\n\n{{Wide image|Everest Panorama from Mars.jpg|1100px|View from the Summit taken by ''Spirit'' on August 23, 2005, as the rover completed the climb up Husband Hill.}}\n\n=== 2006 ===\n\n==== Driving to McCool Hill ====\nIn 2006 ''Spirit'' drove towards an area dubbed Home Plate, and reached it in February. For events in 2006 by NASA see [http://marsrover.nasa.gov/mission/status_spirit_2006.html NASA Spirit Archive 2006]\n\n''Spirit's'' next stop was originally planned to be the north face of [[McCool Hill]], where ''Spirit'' would receive adequate sunlight during the Martian winter. On March 16, 2006 JPL announced that ''Spirit's'' troublesome front wheel had stopped working altogether. Despite this, ''Spirit'' was still making progress toward McCool Hill because the control team programmed the rover to drive toward McCool Hill backwards, dragging its broken wheel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll.html#sol778|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref>  In late March, ''Spirit'' encountered loose soil that was impeding its progress toward McCool Hill. A decision was made to terminate attempts to reach McCool Hill and instead park on a nearby ridge named Low Ridge Haven.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right \n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Home plate anim.gif\n| width1    = {{#expr: (130 * 331 / 285 ) round 0}}\n| alt1      = \n| caption1  = Curious rock near edge of \"Home Plate\" with a jutting portion.

Scientific observations were conducted with ''Spirit's'' robotic arm.\n\n==== Low Ridge Haven ====\n[[File:PIA08576-Spirit Rover-Possible Meteorites at Low Ridge.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Possible meteorites found at Low Ridge]]\nReaching the ridge on April 9, 2006 and parking on the ridge with an 11\u00b0 incline to the north, ''Spirit'' spent the next eight months on the ridge, spending that time undertaking observations of changes in the surrounding area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mars/missions/mer/mer-20060412.html|title=NASA \u2013 NASA Mars Rovers Head for New Sites After Studying Layers|website=www.nasa.gov}}</ref>  No drives were attempted because of the low energy levels the rover was experiencing during the Martian winter. The rover made its first drive, a short turn to position targets of interest within reach of the robotic arm, in early November 2006, following the shortest days of winter and solar conjunction when communications with Earth were severely limited.\n\nWhile at Low Ridge, ''Spirit'' imaged two rocks of similar chemical nature to that of ''Opportunity'''s [[Heat Shield Rock]], a [[meteorite]] on the surface of Mars. Named \"Zhong Shan\" for [[Sun Yat-sen]] and \"Allan Hills\" for the [[Allan Hills|location]] in [[Antarctica]] where several Martian meteorites have been found, they stood out against the background rocks that were darker. Further spectrographic testing is being done to determine the exact composition of these rocks, which may turn out to also be meteorites.\n\n=== 2007 ===\n\n==== Software upgrade ====\nOn January 4, 2007 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2007|01|04}}), both rovers received new flight software to the onboard computers. The update was received just in time for the third anniversary of their landing. The new systems let the rovers decide whether or not to transmit an image, and whether or not to extend their arms to examine rocks, which would save much time for scientists as they would not have to sift through hundreds of images to find the one they want, or examine the surroundings to decide to extend the arms and examine the rocks.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2007/01/04/tech-mars.html | work=CBC News | title=Old rovers learn new tricks | date=January 4, 2007}}</ref>\n\n====Silica Valley====\n[[File:Spirit Mars Silica April 20 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Rover exposes silica-rich dust]]\n''Spirit'''s dead wheel turned out to have a silver lining. As it was traveling in March 2007, pulling the dead wheel behind, the wheel scraped off the upper layer of the Martian soil, uncovering a patch of ground that scientists say shows evidence of a past environment that would have been perfect for microbial life. It is similar to areas on Earth where water or steam from hot springs came into contact with volcanic rocks. On Earth, these are locations that tend to teem with bacteria, said rover chief scientist [[Steve Squyres]]. \"We're really excited about this,\" he told a meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU). The area is extremely rich in [[Silicon dioxide|silica]]\u2013the main ingredient of window glass. The researchers have now concluded that the bright material must have been produced in one of two ways. One: hot-spring deposits produced when water dissolved silica at one location and then carried it to another (i.e. a geyser). Two: acidic steam rising through cracks in rocks  stripped them of their mineral components, leaving silica behind. \"The important thing is that whether it is one hypothesis or the other, the implications for the former habitability of Mars are pretty much the same,\" Squyres explained to BBC News. Hot water provides an environment in which [[microbe]]s can thrive and the precipitation of that silica entombs and preserves them. Squyres added, \"You can go to [[hot spring]]s and you can go to [[fumarole]]s and at either place on Earth it is teeming with life \u2013 [[Microorganism|microbial life]].\"<ref name=\"Amos\">{{cite news  | last = Amos  | first = Jonathan    | title = Mars robot unearths microbe clue   | work = NASA says its robot rover Spirit has made one of its most significant discoveries on the surface of Mars. |publisher=BBC News  | date = December 11, 2007 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7137793.stm  | accessdate =December 12, 2007 }}</ref><ref name=\"20071210a\">{{cite web  | last = Bertster  | first =  Guy   | title = Mars Rover Investigates Signs of Steamy Martian Past  | work = Press Release  | publisher = Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California  | date = December 10, 2007  | url = http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20071210a.html  | accessdate =December 12, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==== Global dust storm and Home Plate ====\nDuring 2007 ''Spirit'' spent several months near the base of the Home Plate plateau. On sol 1306 ''Spirit'' climbed onto the eastern edge of the plateau. In September and October it examined rocks and soils at several locations on the southern half of the plateau. On November 6, ''Spirit'' had reached the western edge of Home Plate, and started taking pictures for a panoramic overview of the western valley, with Grissom Hill and Husband Hill visible. The panorama image was published on NASA's website on January 3, 2008 to little attention, until January 23, when an independent website published a magnified detail of the image that showed a rock feature a few centimeters high resembling a humanoid figure seen from the side with its right arm partially raised.<ref>[http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00001305/ Planetary.org] Emily Lakdawalla, ''Teeny little Bigfoot on Mars'', January 23, 2008 | 12:41 PST | 20:41 UTC</ref><ref>{{Cite APOD |date=January 29, 2008 |title=Spirit's West Valley Panorama image |access-date=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Mars Spirit rover's solar panels covered with Dust - October 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Circular projection showing ''Spirit'''s solar panels covered in dust \u2013 October 2007]]\nTowards the end of June 2007, a series of dust storms began clouding the Martian atmosphere with dust. The storms intensified and by July 20, both ''Spirit'' and ''Opportunity'' were facing the real possibility of system failure due to lack of energy. NASA released a statement to the press that said (in part) \"We're rooting for our rovers to survive these storms, but they were never designed for conditions this intense\".<ref>{{Cite press| url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2007-080| accessdate=August 21, 2009| title=NASA Mars Rovers Braving Severe Dust Storms| date=July 27, 2007| publisher=[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]}}</ref> The key problem caused by the dust storms was a dramatic reduction in solar energy caused by there being so much dust in the atmosphere that it was blocking 99 percent of direct sunlight to ''Opportunity'', and slightly more to ''Spirit''.\n\nNormally the solar arrays on the rovers are able to generate up to {{Convert|700|Wh}} of energy per [[Martian day]]. After the storms, the amount of energy generated was greatly reduced to {{Convert|128|Wh}}. If the rovers generate less than {{Convert|150|Wh}} per day they must start draining their batteries to run survival heaters. If the batteries run dry, key electrical elements are likely to fail due to the intense cold. Both rovers were put into the lowest-power setting in order to wait out the storms. In early August the storms began to clear slightly, allowing the rovers to successfully charge their batteries. They were kept in hibernation in order to wait out the remainder of the storm.<ref>{{Cite press| url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20070807a.html| accessdate=August 21, 2009| title=Martian Skies Brighten Slightly| date=August 7, 2007| publisher=[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]}}</ref>\n\n=== 2008 ===\n\n==== Hibernating ====\nThe main concern was the energy level for ''Spirit''. To increase the amount of light hitting the solar panels, the rover was parked in the northern part of Home Plate on as steep a slope as possible. It was expected that the level of dust cover on the solar panels would increase by 70 percent and that a slope of 30 degrees would be necessary to survive the winter. In February, a tilt of 29.9 degrees was achieved. Extra energy was available at times, and a high definition panorama named ''Bonestell'' was produced. At other times when there was only enough solar energy to recharge the batteries, communication with Earth was minimized and all unnecessary instruments were switched off. At winter solstice the energy production declined to 235 watt hours per sol.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll_2008.html|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref>\n\n==== Winter dust storm ====\nOn November 10, 2008, a large dust storm further reduced the output of the solar panels to {{Convert|89|Wh}} per day\u2014a critically low level.<ref>{{Cite press| url=http://marsrovers.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20081110a.html |accessdate=August 21, 2009|title=Dust Storm Cuts Energy Supply of NASA Mars Rover Spirit| date= November 10, 2008| publisher=[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]}}</ref> NASA officials were hopeful that ''Spirit'' would survive the storm, and that the energy level would rise once the storm had passed and the skies started clearing.

It is also possible that the rover had experienced a mission clock fault. If that had happened, the rover would have lost track of time and tried to remain asleep until enough sunlight struck the solar arrays to wake it. This state is called \"Solar Groovy.\" If the rover woke up from a mission clock fault, it would only listen. Starting on July 26, 2010 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2010|07|26}}), a new procedure to address the possible mission clock fault was implemented.\n\nEach sol, the Deep Space Network mission controllers sent a set of X-band \"Sweep & Beep\" commands. If the rover had experienced a mission clock fault and then had been awoken during the day, it would have listened during brief, 20-minute intervals during each hour awake. Due to the possible clock fault, the timing of these 20-minute listening intervals was not known, so multiple \"Sweep & Beep\" commands were sent. If the rover heard one of these commands, it would have responded with an X-band beep signal, updating the mission controllers on its status and allowing them to investigate the state of the rover further.

However, in the Columbia Hills there was clear evidence for a moderate amount of aqueous weathering. The evidence included sulfates and the minerals goethite and carbonates that only form in the presence of water. It is believed that Gusev crater may have held a lake long ago, but it has since been covered by igneous materials. All the dust contains a magnetic component that was identified as magnetite with some titanium. Furthermore, the thin coating of dust that covers everything on Mars is the same in all parts of Mars.\n\n==Astronomy==\n{{see also|Astronomy on Mars}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = PIA05547-Spirit Rover-Earth seen from Mars.png\n| width1 = {{#expr: (200 * (1194 / 1007)) round 0}}\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = [[Earth]] from Mars\n| image2 = Phobos & Deimos full thumb.png\n| width2 = {{#expr: (200 * (200 / 213)) round 0}}\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = Night sky of Mars showing [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]] (left) and [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] (right) in front of [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]], as seen by [[Mars Exploration Rover]] ''Spirit'' on August 26, 2005.

It also took the first photo of Earth from the surface of another planet in early March 2004.\n\nIn late 2005, ''Spirit'' took advantage of a favorable energy situation to make multiple nighttime observations of both of Mars' moons [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] and [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]].<ref name=\"pancam\">Jim Bell (Cornell University) et al. [http://pancam.astro.cornell.edu/pancam_instrument/projects_2.html Pancam Projects: Spirit Night-time Imaging]. Retrieved 2008-10-21</ref> These observations included a \"[[lunar eclipse|lunar]]\" (or rather phobian) [[eclipse]] as ''Spirit'' watched Phobos disappear into Mars' shadow. Some of ''Spirit'''s star gazing was designed to look for a predicted [[meteor shower]] caused by [[Halley's Comet]], and although at least four imaged streaks were suspect meteors, they could not be unambiguously differentiated from those caused by cosmic rays.<ref name=\"pancam\" />\n\nA [[transit of Mercury from Mars]] took place on January 12, 2005 from about 14:45 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] to 23:05 UTC. Theoretically, this could have been observed by both ''Spirit'' and ''[[Opportunity rover|Opportunity]]''; however, camera resolution did not permit seeing Mercury's [[Arc second|6.1\"]] angular diameter. They were able to observe transits of [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]] across the Sun, but at [[Arc minute|2']] angular diameter, Deimos is about 20 times larger than Mercury's 6.1\" angular diameter. Ephemeris data generated by [[JPL Horizons]] indicates that ''Opportunity'' would have been able to observe the transit from the start until local sunset at about 19:23 UTC Earth time, while ''Spirit'' would have been able to observe it from local sunrise at about 19:38 UTC until the end of the transit.{{Clarify|date=October 2008}}<!-- the nasa.gov URL does not state any of this; need instructions on how to verify this --><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?horizons|title=HORIZONS System|first=Alan|last=Chamberlin|website=ssd.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref>\n\n==Equipment wear and failures==\nBoth rovers passed their original mission time of 90 sols many times over. The extended time on the surface, and therefore additional stress on components, resulted in some issues developing.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/>\n\nOn March 13, 2006 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2006|03|13}}), the right front wheel ceased working<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-b.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/mer/images.cfm/images.cfm?id=1906|title=JPL.NASA.GOV: Mars Exploration Rovers|website=www-b.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref> after having covered {{Convert|4.2|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} on Mars. Engineers began driving the rover backwards, dragging the dead wheel. Although this resulted in changes to driving techniques, the dragging effect became a useful tool, partially clearing away soil on the surface as the rover traveled, thus allowing areas to be imaged that would normally be inaccessible. However, in mid-December 2009, to the surprise of the engineers, the right front wheel showed slight movement in a wheel-test on sol 2113 and clearly rotated with normal resistance on three of four wheel-tests on sol 2117, but stalled on the fourth. On November 29, 2009 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2009|11|29}}), the right rear wheel also stalled and remained inoperable for the remainder of the mission.\n\nScientific instruments also experienced degradation as a result of exposure to the harsh Martian environment and use over a far longer period than had been anticipated by the mission planners. Over time, the diamond in the resin grinding surface of the [[Rock Abrasion Tool]] wore down, after that the device could only be used to brush targets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/rover/Roverextension.html|title=NASA\u02bcs Mars rovers and Steve Squyres keep going and going \u2013 Cornell Chronicle|website=www.news.cornell.edu}}</ref> All of the other science instruments and engineering cameras continued to function until contact was lost; however, towards the end of ''Spirit'''s life, the [[MIMOS II]] [[M\u00f6ssbauer spectrometer]] took much longer to produce results than it did earlier in the mission because of the decay of its [[cobalt]]-57 gamma ray source that has a half life of 271 days.\n\n==Honors==\n[[File:MarsSunsetCut.jpg|thumb|right|Martian sunset in 2005 by ''Spirit'']]\n\n===To rover===\nTo commemorate ''Spirit'''s great contribution to the [[exploration of Mars]], the [[asteroid]]  [[37452 Spirit]] has been named after it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.nasa.gov/spotlight/20041011.html|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: Spotlight|website=marsrovers.nasa.gov}}</ref> The name was proposed by [[Ingrid van Houten-Groeneveld]] who along with [[Cornelis Johannes van Houten]] and [[Tom Gehrels]] discovered the asteroid on September 24, 1960.\n\n[[Reuben H.

August 14 at the [[China Agricultural University Gymnasium]].\n\nThis [[Greco-Roman wrestling]] competition consists of a single-elimination tournament, with a [[repechage]] used to determine the winner of two bronze medals. The two finalists face off for gold and silver medals. Each wrestler who loses to one of the two finalists moves into the repechage, culminating in a pair of bronze medal matches featuring the semifinal losers each facing the remaining repechage opponent from their half of the bracket.\n\nEach bout consists of up to three rounds, lasting two minutes apiece. The wrestler who scores more points in each round is the winner of that rounds; the bout ends when one wrestler has won two rounds (and thus the match).\n\n==Schedule==\n<small>All times are [[China

{"title_page": "Ear mite", "text_new": "{{short description|Common name of many species of mites that live in the ears of animals and humans}}\n[[File:Ear mite 1.JPG|thumb|''[[Otodectes cynotis]]'']]\n\n'''Ear mites''' are [[mite]]s that live in the [[ear]]s of animals and humans. The most commonly seen [[species]] in veterinary medicine is ''[[Otodectes cynotis]]'' (Gk. ''oto''=ear, ''dectes''=biter, ''cynotis''=of the dog). This species, despite its name, is also responsible for 90% of ear mite infections in cats.\n\nIn veterinary practice, ear mite infections in dogs and cats may present as a disease that causes intense itching in one or both ears, which in turn triggers scratching at the affected ear. An unusually dark colored ear wax ([[cerumen]]) may also be produced. Cats, as well as dogs with erect ears that have control over ear direction, may be seen with one or both ear pinnas held at an odd or flattened angle.\n\nThe most common lesion associated with ear mites is an open or crusted (\"scabbed\") skin wound at the back or base of the ear, caused by abrasion of the skin by hind limb claws, as the ear has been scratched in an attempt to relieve the itching. This lesion often becomes secondarily infected and crusted from ordinary skin bacteria, so that the common presentation of ear mites is such a wound appearing on the back or base of one or both ears. This is accompanied by the Pinnal-Pedal Reflex that appears as reflex scratching motions of the hind limb when the ear is manipulated (this test is positive as well in other mite infections of the outside and rim of the ear pinnas in [[mange]]). When the ear mite infection is treated, such wounds resolve spontaneously, and this resolution may be speeded with application of topical antibiotics.\n\nThe most common ear mite (as well as mange mite) treatments currently use the antiparasitics [[ivermectin]] and [[selamectin]], usually as topical preparations. Ivermectin is available as a direct water-based liquid that is squeezed into the ear canal and massaged at the base of the ear to distribute the medication. Selamectin is available as a once-a-month preparation that can be applied to the animal's skin, which prevents mite infestation over that time.\nThey also host swinger parties.\n\n==Contagion==\nEar mites spread rapidly, and can be transmitted from even brief physical contact with other animals. In pets, ear mites most commonly affect [[cat]]s, [[ferret]]s, and to a lesser extent [[dog]]s. Humans can rarely be infected with ear mites.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=17488924 |year=2007 |last1=Al-Arfaj |first1=AM |last2=Mullen |first2=GR |last3=Rashad |first3=R |last4=Abdel-Hameed |first4=A |last5=Oconnor |first5=BM |last6=Alkhalife |first6=IS |last7=Dute |first7=RR |title=A human case of otoacariasis involving a histiostomatid mite (Acari: Histiostomatidae) |volume=76 |issue=5 |pages=967\u201371 |journal=The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene |url=http://www.ajtmh.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17488924 |doi=10.4269/ajtmh.2007.76.967|doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=19588062 |year=2009 |last1=Klemm |first1=E |last2=Haroske |first2=G |last3=Wollina |first3=U |title=Otitis externa and myringitis due to demodicidosis |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=73\u20136 |journal=Acta Dermatovenerologica Alpina, Pannonica et Adriatica |url=http://www.zsd.si/ACTA/PUBLIC_HTML/acta-apa-09-2/6.pdf |access-date=2011-11-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425154643/http://www.zsd.si/ACTA/PUBLIC_HTML/acta-apa-09-2/6.pdf |archive-date=2012-04-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7CLzqMCmqE{{MEDRS |date=November 2011}}</ref> Infected animals have a large amount of crumbly dark brown material in their ears.

[[Greco-Roman wrestling]] competition consists of a single-elimination tournament, with a [[repechage]] used to determine the winner of two bronze medals. The two finalists face off for gold and silver medals. Each wrestler who loses to one of the two finalists moves into the repechage, culminating in a pair of bronze medal matches featuring the semifinal losers each facing the remaining repechage opponent from their half of the bracket.\n\nEach bout consists of up to three rounds, lasting two minutes apiece. The wrestler who scores more points in each round is the winner of that rounds; the bout ends when one wrestler has won two rounds (and thus the match).\n\nThe winner of the event, [[Mija\u00edn L\u00f3pez]], won his second Olympic title.\n\n==Schedule==\n<small>All times are [[British Summer Time]] ([[UTC+01:00]])</small>\n{|class = \"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

He also provided a complete solution to the four cubes problem as in [[Plato's number]] {{nowrap|3{{sup|3}} + 4{{sup|3}} + 5{{sup|3}} {{=}} 6{{sup|3}}}} or the [[taxicab number]] 1729.<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Dunham |editor-first=William |year=2007 |title=The Genius of Euler: Reflections on His Life and Work |publisher=The MAA |isbn=978-0-88385-558-4 |page=220 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M4-zUnrSxNoC&pg=PA220}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Titus, III |first=Piezas |year=2005 |title=Euler's Extended Conjecture |url=http://www.oocities.org/titus_piezas/Equalsums.htm }}</ref> The general solution of the equation\n:<math>x_1^3+x_2^3=x_3^3+x_4^3</math>\nis\n:<math>x_1 = 1-(a-3b)(a^2+3b^2), \\quad x_2 = (a+3b)(a^2+3b^2)-1</math>\n:<math>x_3 = (a+3b)-(a^2+3b^2)^2, \\quad x_4 = (a^2+3b^2)^2-(a-3b)</math>\nwhere {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are any integers.\n\n== Counterexamples ==\nEuler's conjecture was disproven by [[Leon J.

It is unknown whether the conjecture fails or holds for any value {{math|''k'' \u2265 6}}.\n\n== Background ==\nEuler was aware of the equality {{nowrap|59{{sup|4}} + 158{{sup|4}} {{=}} 133{{sup|4}} + 134{{sup|4}}}} involving sums of four fourth powers; this however is not a [[counterexample]] because no term is isolated on one side of the equation. He also provided a complete solution to the four cubes problem as in [[Plato's number]] {{nowrap|3{{sup|3}} + 4{{sup|3}} + 5{{sup|3}} {{=}} 6{{sup|3}}}} or the [[taxicab number]] 1729.<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Dunham |editor-first=William |year=2007 |title=The Genius of Euler: Reflections on His Life and Work |publisher=The MAA |isbn=978-0-88385-558-4 |page=220 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M4-zUnrSxNoC&pg=PA220}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Titus, III |first=Piezas |year=2005 |title=Euler's Extended Conjecture |url=http://www.oocities.org/titus_piezas/Equalsums.htm }}</ref> The general solution of the equation\n:<math>x_1^3+x_2^3=x_3^3+x_4^3</math>\nis\n:<math>x_1 = 1-(a-3b)(a^2+3b^2), \\quad x_2 = (a+3b)(a^2+3b^2)-1</math>\n:<math>x_3 = (a+3b)-(a^2+3b^2)^2, \\quad x_4 = (a^2+3b^2)^2-(a-3b)</math>\nwhere {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are any integers.\n\n== Counterexamples ==\nEuler's conjecture was disproven by [[Leon J.

Born in the south of France at [[Cannes]], of British parents, in 1910 he settled in London, where he was an associate of [[Spencer Gore (artist)|Spencer Gore]] and [[Harold Gilman]] and a key member of the [[Camden Town Group]].\n\n==Early years and studies==\nCharles Isaac Ginner was born on 4 March 1878 in Cannes, the second son of Isaac Benjamin Ginner, a British doctor. He had a younger sister, [[Ruby Ginner|Ruby]] (b. 1886; who became the dance teacher Ruby Dyer). He was educated in Cannes at the [[Institut Stanislas]].\n\nAt an early age, Ginner formed the intention of becoming a painter, but his parents disapproved. When he was sixteen, he suffered from [[typhoid]] and double pneumonia and travelled in a tramp steamer around the south Atlantic and the Mediterranean to convalesce; on returning to Cannes, he worked in an engineer's office, and in 1899, at the age of 21, moved to Paris to study architecture.\n\nIn 1904, his parents withdrew their opposition to his becoming a painter, and Ginner entered the [[Academie Vitti]], where [[Henri-Jean Guillaume Martin|Henri Martin]] was teaching but where Ginner worked mostly under [[Paul Gervais (painter)|Paul Gervais]], who disapproved of Ginner's use of bright colours. In 1905, Ginner moved to the [[Ecole des Beaux Arts]], but in 1906, after Gervais had left, he returned to Vitti's, where his principal teacher was [[Hermenegildo Anglada Camarasa]], who disapproved of Ginner's admiration for [[Vincent van Gogh]].\n\n==Painting career==\nIn 1908, Ginner left Vitti's and worked on his own in Paris, taking [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul Gauguin]] and [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]] for his guides.\n\nIn 1909, Ginner visited [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina, where he held his first one-person show, which helped to introduce post-Impressionism to South America. His oil paintings showed the influence of Van Gogh, with their heavy impasto paint.\n\nIn 1910 Ginner went to London, to serve on the Hanging Committee of the [[Allied Artists Association]]'s third exhibition. [[Harold Gilman]] and [[Spencer Gore (artist)|Spencer Gore]] became his friends and persuaded him to settle in London. He lived at first in Battersea, but afterwards in Camden Town, where he was a neighbour of Gilman and Gore and regularly attended the Saturday afternoons at 19 Fitzroy Street, meeting [[Robert Bevan]], [[John Nash (artist)|John Nash]], Albert Rothenstein, [[Christopher R. W. Nevinson]], [[Jacob Epstein]], Walter Bayes, [[Walter Sickert]] and [[Lucien Pissarro]]. In 1911, he became a member of the [[Camden Town Group]]; in 1913 of the [[London Group]]; in 1914 of the [[Cumberland Market Group]].<ref name=\"Grove\">\"Cumberland Market Group\", [http://www.oxfordartonline.com Grove Art Online](subscription). Retrieved 20 September 2008.</ref> In 1914 in the ''New Age'' he spelt out the artistic creed known as [[Neorealism (art)|New Realism]]. In the same year he showed jointly with Gilman at the [[Goupil Gallery]].\n\nDuring [[World War I]], in about 1916, Ginner was called up, serving firstly in the [[Royal Army Ordnance Corps]], secondly in the Intelligence Corps and lastly for the Canadian War Records, for which he made a painting of a powder-filling factory in Hereford.\n\nIn 1919, on Gilman's death, he published an appreciation of the artist in ''Art and Letters''. In 1920 he became a member of the [[New English Art Club]].\n\nDuring [[World War II]] he was again an Official War Artist, and specialised in painting harbour scenes and bombed buildings in London. In 1942 he became an [[Associate of the Royal Academy]], where he advocated the admission of younger artists.\n\nIn 1950, he was awarded a [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]].\n\nGinner painted buildings in an urban context, as in his painting ''Plymouth Pier from The Hoe''. His watercolours are unmistakable, with meticulous detailing of trees and buildings.\n\nThe [[Tate]] Gallery in London and many other galleries hold his work. The [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]], London, has a typically precise self-portrait.\n\nHe died in London on 6 January 1952. The [[Arts Council of Great Britain]] held a touring memorial in 1953-4.\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Helena Bonett, 'Charles Ginner 1878\u20131952', artist biography, January 2011, in Helena Bonett, Ysanne Holt, Jennifer Mundy (eds.), ''The Camden Town Group in Context'', Tate, May 2012, http://www.tate.org.uk/art/research-publications/camden-town-group/charles-ginner-r1105346\n* Robert Upstone, ''Modern Painters: The Camden Town Group'', exhibition catalogue, [[Tate Britain]], London, 2008 {{ISBN|1-85437-781-7}}\n* J.

In 1905, Ginner moved to the [[Ecole des Beaux Arts]], but in 1906, after Gervais had left, he returned to Vitti's, where his principal teacher was [[Hermenegildo Anglada Camarasa]], who disapproved of Ginner's admiration for [[Vincent van Gogh]].\n\n==Painting career==\nIn 1908, Ginner left Vitti's and worked on his own in Paris, taking [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul Gauguin]] and [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]] for his guides.\n\nIn 1909, Ginner visited [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina, where he held his first one-person show, which helped to introduce post-Impressionism to South America. His oil paintings showed the influence of Van Gogh, with their heavy impasto paint.\n\nIn 1910 Ginner went to London, to serve on the Hanging Committee of the [[Allied Artists Association]]'s third exhibition. [[Harold Gilman]] and [[Spencer Gore (artist)|Spencer Gore]] became his friends and persuaded him to settle in London. He lived at first in Battersea, but afterwards in Camden Town, where he was a neighbour of Gilman and Gore and regularly attended the Saturday afternoons at 19 Fitzroy Street, meeting [[Robert Bevan]], [[John Nash (artist)|John Nash]], Albert Rothenstein, [[Christopher R. W. Nevinson]], [[Jacob Epstein]], Walter Bayes, [[Walter Sickert]] and [[Lucien Pissarro]]. In 1911, he became a member of the [[Camden Town Group]]; in 1913 of the [[London Group]]; in 1914 of the [[Cumberland Market Group]].<ref name=\"Grove\">\"Cumberland Market Group\", [http://www.oxfordartonline.com Grove Art Online](subscription). Retrieved 20 September 2008.</ref> In 1914 in the ''New Age'' he spelt out the artistic creed known as [[Neorealism (art)|New Realism]]. In the same year he showed jointly with Gilman at the [[Goupil Gallery]].\n\nDuring [[World War I]], in about 1916, Ginner was called up, serving firstly in the [[Royal Army Ordnance Corps]], secondly in the Intelligence Corps and lastly for the Canadian War Records, for which he made a painting of a powder-filling factory in Hereford.\n\nIn 1919, on Gilman's death, he published an appreciation of the artist in ''Art and Letters''. In 1920 he became a member of the [[New English Art Club]].\n\nDuring [[World War II]] he was again an Official War Artist, and specialised in painting harbour scenes and bombed buildings in London. In 1942 he became an [[Associate of the Royal Academy]], where he advocated the admission of younger artists.\n\nIn 1950, he was awarded a [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]].\n\nGinner painted buildings in an urban context, as in his painting ''Plymouth Pier from The Hoe''. His watercolours are unmistakable, with meticulous detailing of trees and buildings.\n\nThe [[Tate]] Gallery in London and many other galleries hold his work. The [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]], London, has a typically precise self-portrait.\n\nHe died in London on 6 January 1952. The [[Arts Council of Great Britain]] held a touring memorial in 1953-4.\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Helena Bonett, 'Charles Ginner 1878\u20131952', artist biography, January 2011, in Helena Bonett, Ysanne Holt, Jennifer Mundy (eds.), ''The Camden Town Group in Context'', Tate, May 2012, http://www.tate.org.uk/art/research-publications/camden-town-group/charles-ginner-r1105346\n* Robert Upstone, ''Modern Painters: The Camden Town Group'', exhibition catalogue, [[Tate Britain]], London, 2008 {{ISBN|1-85437-781-7}}\n* J.

{"title_page": "Spike-timing-dependent plasticity", "text_new": "'''Spike-timing-dependent plasticity''' ('''STDP''') is a biological process that adjusts the strength of connections between neurons in the brain. The process adjusts the connection strengths based on the relative timing of a particular neuron's output and input [[action potential]]s (or spikes). The STDP process partially explains the activity-dependent development of nervous systems, especially with regard to [[long-term potentiation]] and [[long-term depression]].\n\n== Process ==\n\nUnder the STDP process, if an input spike to a neuron tends, on average, to occur immediately ''before'' that neuron's output spike, then that particular input is made somewhat stronger. If an input spike tends, on average, to occur immediately ''after'' an output spike, then that particular input is made somewhat weaker hence: \"spike-timing-dependent plasticity\". Thus, inputs that might be the cause of the post-synaptic neuron's excitation are made even more likely to contribute in the future, whereas inputs that are not the cause of the post-synaptic spike are made less likely to contribute in the future. The process continues until a subset of the initial set of connections remain, while the influence of all others is reduced to 0. Since a neuron produces an output spike when many of its inputs occur within a brief period, the subset of inputs that remain are those that tended to be correlated in time. In addition, since the inputs that occur before the output are strengthened, the inputs that provide the earliest indication of correlation will eventually become the final input to the neuron.\n\n== History ==\nIn 1973, M.

Bell and co-workers also found a form of STDP in the cerebellum. Henry Markram used dual patch clamping techniques to repetitively activate pre-synaptic neurons 10 milliseconds before activating the post-synaptic target neurons, and found the strength of the synapse increased. When the activation order was reversed so that the pre-synaptic neuron was activated 10 milliseconds after its post-synaptic target neuron, the strength of the pre-to-post synaptic connection decreased.

This phenomenon has been observed in various other preparations, with some variation in the time-window relevant for plasticity. Several reasons for timing-dependent plasticity have been suggested. For example, STDP might provide a substrate for Hebbian learning during development,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Gerstner W, Kempter R, van Hemmen JL, Wagner H | title= A neuronal learning rule for sub-millisecond temporal coding. | journal = Nature | volume =  383|pages = 76\u201378 |date=September 1996 | pmid = 8779718 | doi=10.1038/383076a0 | issue=6595| url= http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/97773 | bibcode= 1996Natur.383...76G }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Song S, Miller KD, Abbott LF |title=Competitive Hebbian learning through spike-timing-dependent synaptic plasticity |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=3 |issue=9 |pages=919\u201326 |date=September 2000 |pmid=10966623 |doi=10.1038/78829 }}</ref> or, as suggested by Taylor<ref name=\"MMT\" /> in 1973, the associated Hebbian and anti-Hebbian learning rules might create informationally efficient coding in bundles of related neurons.

Due to their high permeability for calcium, they generate a local chemical signal that is largest when the [[Neural backpropagation|back-propagating action potential]] in the dendrite arrives shortly after the synapse was active (''pre-post spiking''). Large postsynaptic calcium transients are known to trigger synaptic potentiation ([[Long-term potentiation]]). The mechanism for spike-timing-dependent depression is less well understood, but often involves either postsynaptic voltage-dependent calcium entry/[[mGluR]] activation, or retrograde [[endocannabinoids]] and presynaptic [[NMDAR]]s.\n\n== From Hebbian rule to STDP ==\n\nAccording to the [[Hebbian theory|Hebbian rule]], synapses increase their efficiency if the synapse persistently takes part in firing the postsynaptic target neuron. An often-used simplification is ''those who fire together, wire together'', but if two neurons fire exactly at the same time, then one cannot have caused, or taken part in firing the other. Instead, to take part in firing the postsynaptic neuron, the presynaptic neuron needs to fire just before the postsynaptic neuron. Experiments that stimulated two connected neurons with varying interstimulus asynchrony confirmed the importance of temporal precedence implicit in Hebb's principle: the [[Chemical synapse|presynaptic]] neuron has to fire just before the [[Chemical synapse|postsynaptic]] neuron for the synapse to be potentiated.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Caporale N. |author2=Dan Y. | year = 2008 | title = Spike timing-dependent plasticity: a Hebbian learning rule | url = | journal = Annual Review of Neuroscience | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 25\u201346 | doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.31.060407.125639 | pmid=18275283}}</ref> In addition, it has become evident that the presynaptic neural firing needs to consistently predict the postsynaptic firing for synaptic plasticity to occur robustly,<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Bauer E.

Bell and co-workers also found a form of STDP in the cerebellum. Henry Markram used dual patch clamping techniques to repetitively activate pre-synaptic neurons 10 milliseconds before activating the post-synaptic target neurons, and found the strength of the synapse increased. When the activation order was reversed so that the pre-synaptic neuron was activated 10 milliseconds after its post-synaptic target neuron, the strength of the pre-to-post synaptic connection decreased.

This phenomenon has been observed in various other preparations, with some variation in the time-window relevant for plasticity. Several reasons for timing-dependent plasticity have been suggested. For example, STDP might provide a substrate for Hebbian learning during development,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Gerstner W, Kempter R, van Hemmen JL, Wagner H | title= A neuronal learning rule for sub-millisecond temporal coding. | journal = Nature | volume =  383|pages = 76\u201378 |date=September 1996 | pmid = 8779718 | doi=10.1038/383076a0 | issue=6595| url= http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/97773 | bibcode= 1996Natur.383...76G }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Song S, Miller KD, Abbott LF |title=Competitive Hebbian learning through spike-timing-dependent synaptic plasticity |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=3 |issue=9 |pages=919\u201326 |date=September 2000 |pmid=10966623 |doi=10.1038/78829 }}</ref> or, as suggested by Taylor<ref name=\"MMT\" /> in 1973, the associated Hebbian and anti-Hebbian learning rules might create informationally efficient coding in bundles of related neurons.

Due to their high permeability for calcium, they generate a local chemical signal that is largest when the [[Neural backpropagation|back-propagating action potential]] in the dendrite arrives shortly after the synapse was active (''pre-post spiking''). Large postsynaptic calcium transients are known to trigger synaptic potentiation ([[Long-term potentiation]]). The mechanism for spike-timing-dependent depression is less well understood, but often involves either postsynaptic voltage-dependent calcium entry/[[mGluR]] activation, or retrograde [[endocannabinoids]] and presynaptic [[NMDAR]]s.\n\n== From Hebbian rule to STDP ==\n\nAccording to the [[Hebbian theory|Hebbian rule]], synapses increase their efficiency if the synapse persistently takes part in firing the postsynaptic target neuron. An often-used simplification is ''those who fire together, wire together'', but if two neurons fire exactly at the same time, then one cannot have caused, or taken part in firing the other. Instead, to take part in firing the postsynaptic neuron, the presynaptic neuron needs to fire just before the postsynaptic neuron. Experiments that stimulated two connected neurons with varying interstimulus asynchrony confirmed the importance of temporal precedence implicit in Hebb's principle: the [[Chemical synapse|presynaptic]] neuron has to fire just before the [[Chemical synapse|postsynaptic]] neuron for the synapse to be potentiated.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Caporale N. |author2=Dan Y. | year = 2008 | title = Spike timing-dependent plasticity: a Hebbian learning rule | url = | journal = Annual Review of Neuroscience | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 25\u201346 | doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.31.060407.125639 | pmid=18275283}}</ref> In addition, it has become evident that the presynaptic neural firing needs to consistently predict the postsynaptic firing for synaptic plasticity to occur robustly,<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Bauer E.
