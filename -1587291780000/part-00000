[[David Ray Griffin]] and [[Alex Jones]] have asserted that large parts of the plane, including the main body of the engine, landed miles away from the main wreckage site, too far away for an ordinary plane crash. Jones says that planes usually leave a small debris field when they crash, and that this is not compatible with reports of wreckage found farther away from the main crash site. One person claimed that the main body of the engine was found miles away from the main wreckage site with damage comparable to that which a heat-seeking missile would do to an airliner.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /><ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\" />\n\nAccording to some theories, the plane had to be shot down by the government because passengers had found out about the alleged plot.<ref name=\"women.timesonline.co.uk\"/>\n\nAccording to Phil Mol\u00e9 of ''[[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|Skeptic]]'' magazine, \"[this] claim rests largely on unsupported assertions that the main body of the engine and other large parts of the plane turned up miles from the main wreckage site, too far away to have resulted from an ordinary crash.

They join the movement for different reasons, loosely self-assemble to fill different roles and are united by their shared mistrust in experts and the establishment (government and reputable sources of knowledge), and conspiratorial stance. Through their engagement, they each find their own fulfillment and satisfaction. Together, they contribute to the persistence, resilience and exaggerated claims of acceptance (in general public) of the movement. These three groups are:<ref name=Bartlett>{{cite journal |last1=Bartlett |first1=Jamie |last2=Miller |first2=Carl |title=A Bestiary of the 9/11 Truth Movement: Notes from the Front Line |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |volume=35.4 |issue=July/August |pages=43\u201346 |year=2011 |publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/a_bestiary_of_the_9_11_truth_movement_notes_from_the_front_line |accessdate=May 29, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001051753/http://www.csicop.org/si/show/a_bestiary_of_the_9_11_truth_movement_notes_from_the_front_line |archive-date=October 1, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n* Hard Core: The organizers and active members of the various 9/11 Truth Movement organizations. They produce the information, spot the anomalies and technical inconsistencies, provide the technical base and form the theories. While they claim to be only interested in facts and to use [[scientific method]], they commit the logical fallacy of '[[confirmation bias]]' by pre-determining the outcome, then searching for corroborating evidence while ignoring the vast body of [[peer-review]]ed, independent, consensual research which contradict their theories. They supply the physical structure of the movement by organizing events, seminars, discussions, marches and distributing flyers and pamphlets. Their numbers are relatively small but they are tight-knit and highly connected. Their worldview favors 'super-conspiracy', a master plan that is behind conspiracies which they believe they are uncovering.<ref name=Bartlett/>\n* Critically turned: They are the young students and political activists whose affiliation with the 9/11 Truth Movement often is rooted from their dissatisfaction and anger at the established political and social order. Their sense of justice and [[idealism]] propels them to activism against perceived oppression and social injustice. Their penchant to use Internet, especially [[social media]], and tech savvy make them the propaganda machine for the movement. They produce [[YouTube]] videos and films with cool, countercultural content, make good use of pop culture parody and eye-catching graphics. The countercultural street cred of their productions buy them broad appeal and exposure to millions of people.<ref name=Bartlett/>\n* Illiterati: They are the movement's mass membership backbone, a large, diffuse group which give the movement exaggerated claims of popularity and influence. Participation in the 9/11 Truth Movement, to this group of people, is as much a social and recreational pursuit as the quest for truth. Their partaking is mostly through [[web 2.0]] social networking and YouTube. Their commentaries often are emotional and they make no pretense to be accurate, balanced or to show genuine intent to find truth. Involvement with the movement that fit their worldview gives them a sense of identity and belonging, which they find more appealing than the facts and evidences of the 9/11 terrorist attack itself.<ref name=Bartlett/>\n\n== Media reaction ==\nWhile discussion and coverage of these theories is mainly confined to Internet pages, books, documentary films, and conversation, a number of mainstream news outlets around the world have covered the issue.\n\nThe Norwegian version of the July 2006 ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'' sparked interest when they ran, on their own initiative, a three-page main story on the 9/11 attacks and summarized the various types of 9/11 conspiracy theories (which were not specifically endorsed by the newspaper, only recensed).<ref>[http://www.lmd.no/index.php?article=947 11.September \u2013 en innsidejobb?], Norwegian edition of ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', July 2006.

Thomas pointed out that when [[Jesse Ventura]] hired [[New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology|New Mexico Tech]] to conduct a demonstration showing nanothermite slicing through a large steel beam, the nanothermite produced copious flame and smoke but no damage to the beam, even though it was in a horizontal, and therefore optimally positioned.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Thomas | first1=Dave | title=The 9/11 Truth Movement: The Top Conspiracy Theory, a Decade Later | journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] | date=July\u2013August 2011 | pages=34\u201340 | volume=35 | issue=4 | url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/the_9_11_truth_movement_the_top_conspiracy_theory_a_decade_later/ | access-date=September 11, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120923074425/http://www.csicop.org/si/show/the_9_11_truth_movement_the_top_conspiracy_theory_a_decade_later | archive-date=September 23, 2012 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) concluded the accepted version was more than sufficient to explain the collapse of the buildings.

Jones says that planes usually leave a small debris field when they crash, and that this is not compatible with reports of wreckage found farther away from the main crash site.

Most no-planes adherents, including [[Thierry Meyssan]] and Reynolds, assert that either CGI of a passenger plane was overlaid onto a winged cruise missile or military aircraft, or that computer-generated images of a passenger plane were inserted into the video footage and plane-shaped explosive cut-outs were planted in the buildings in order to create the impression of plane impact.<ref>[Weekend Live, Fox News, September 10, 2006|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reQZT9Hzvt8]</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/apr/01/september11.france|title=US invented air attack on Pentagon, claims French book|last=Henley|first=Jon|date=2002-04-01|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-04-25|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>The Great Derangement, Matt Taibbi, New York, 2009</ref> Some truth movement veterans have repeatedly refuted the \"no-plane\" claims.<ref name=\"women.timesonline.co.uk\"/><ref name=\"msnbc\">{{Cite news| url = http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003250424_911conspire09.html| title = WP: 9/11 conspiracy theories| author = Michael Powell| date = September 8, 2006| publisher = [[MSNBC]]| accessdate = June 13, 2010| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100723110251/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003250424_911conspire09.html| archivedate = July 23, 2010| url-status = dead| df = mdy-all}}</ref> In fact, discussion of no-plane theories has been banned from certain conspiracy theory websites and advocates have sometimes been threatened with violence by posters at other conspiracy theory websites.<ref name=Yoda>{{cite web|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2007-08-09/news/the-yoda-of-9-11/5 |title=The Yoda of 9/11|page=5 |work=Phoenix News|publisher=Phoenixnewtimes.com |date= |accessdate=July 20, 2009}}</ref>\n\n== Cover-up allegations ==\nPaul Zarembka, in his book, ''The Hidden History of 9/11'', states that the debris from ground zero was removed without a proper forensic investigation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/sep/12/911thebigcoverup|title=9/11 \u2013 the big cover-up?|author=Peter Tatchell|publisher=Guardian News and Media, Ltd.|date=September 12, 2007|accessdate=January 12, 2010 | location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100110223812/http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2007/sep/12/911thebigcoverup| archivedate=January 10, 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=o9jo_In37aEC&pg=PA95&dq=9/11+coverup+debris+removal|title=The hidden history of 9-11-2001|author=Paul Zermebka|publisher=Elsevier JAI|year=2006|pages=94, 95|isbn=978-0-7623-1305-1}}</ref>\n\n=== Cockpit recorders ===\n[[File:Flight 77 CVR.jpg|thumb|The [[cockpit voice recorder]] from [[American Airlines Flight 77|Flight 77]] was heavily damaged from the impact and resulting fire.]]\nAccording to the 9/11 Commission Report, both black boxes from Flight 77 and both black boxes from Flight 93 were recovered.

They produce the information, spot the anomalies and technical inconsistencies, provide the technical base and form the theories. While they claim to be only interested in facts and to use [[scientific method]], they commit the logical fallacy of '[[confirmation bias]]' by pre-determining the outcome, then searching for corroborating evidence while ignoring the vast body of [[peer-review]]ed, independent, consensual research which contradict their theories. They supply the physical structure of the movement by organizing events, seminars, discussions, marches and distributing flyers and pamphlets. Their numbers are relatively small but they are tight-knit and highly connected. Their worldview favors 'super-conspiracy', a master plan that is behind conspiracies which they believe they are uncovering.<ref name=Bartlett/>\n* Critically turned: They are the young students and political activists whose affiliation with the 9/11 Truth Movement often is rooted from their dissatisfaction and anger at the established political and social order. Their sense of justice and [[idealism]] propels them to activism against perceived oppression and social injustice. Their penchant to use Internet, especially [[social media]], and tech savvy make them the propaganda machine for the movement. They produce [[YouTube]] videos and films with cool, countercultural content, make good use of pop culture parody and eye-catching graphics. The countercultural street cred of their productions buy them broad appeal and exposure to millions of people.<ref name=Bartlett/>\n* Illiterati: They are the movement's mass membership backbone, a large, diffuse group which give the movement exaggerated claims of popularity and influence. Participation in the 9/11 Truth Movement, to this group of people, is as much a social and recreational pursuit as the quest for truth. Their partaking is mostly through [[web 2.0]] social networking and YouTube. Their commentaries often are emotional and they make no pretense to be accurate, balanced or to show genuine intent to find truth. Involvement with the movement that fit their worldview gives them a sense of identity and belonging, which they find more appealing than the facts and evidences of the 9/11 terrorist attack itself.<ref name=Bartlett/>\n\n== Media reaction ==\nWhile discussion and coverage of these theories is mainly confined to Internet pages, books, documentary films, and conversation, a number of mainstream news outlets around the world have covered the issue.\n\nThe Norwegian version of the July 2006 ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'' sparked interest when they ran, on their own initiative, a three-page main story on the 9/11 attacks and summarized the various types of 9/11 conspiracy theories (which were not specifically endorsed by the newspaper, only recensed).<ref>[http://www.lmd.no/index.php?article=947 11.September \u2013 en innsidejobb?], Norwegian edition of ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', July 2006.

According to an international poll that same year, huge majorities in Muslim countries prefer to believe baseless conspiracy theories rather than listen to the mainstream facts of what happened on September 11, 2001, in New York City and Washington. Although al-Qaeda occasionally brags about its \"achievement,\" 75 percent of Egyptian citizens, for example, still deny that Arabs carried out the attacks, as a Pew study reported in July 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/getting-egypts-morsi-to-give-up-911-conspiracy-rhetoric/2012/09/11/4ca304ea-fb97-11e1-8adc-499661afe377_story.html |title=Getting Egypt's Morsi to give up his 9/11 'truther' talk by Robert Satloff and Eric Trager of the Washington Post September 11, 2012 |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04}}</ref>\n\n== Legal cases ==\nArmy specialist April Gallop filed suit claiming that Vice President [[Dick Cheney]], Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]], and other Bush administration officials orchestrated the 9/11 attacks and that the Pentagon was hit by an attack ordered by Cheney.

Her lawyers filed an appeal to the [[U.S. Court of Appeals]] which in April 2010 issued a [[show cause order]] why the lawyers and Gallop should not be sanctioned for filing a frivolous lawsuit. Her lawyers asked that the judges on the Court of Appeals recuse themselves because their emotions made them prejudge the case and abuse their power. On October 14, 2011, the judges sanctioned her lawyers $15,000 each for both the frivolous lawsuits and the accusations of prejudice.

Claims that the furnishings belonged to his daughter or had been sold to a Scottish merchant in London, Robert English, were disregarded. Some goods at Aldersgate were sold in October 1648. It also came to light that Mary had lent \u00a32,000 to the [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Cleveland|Earl of Cleveland]] and obtained property in Hackney and Stepney, and \u00a31000 to Elizabeth Ashfield, a neighbour in Aldersgate, gaining her lands at North Barsteed in Suffolk.<ref>''Calendar of the Proceedings of the Committee for Advance of Money, 1642-1656'', part 2 (London, 1888), p. 948-952, the [[National Library of Scotland]] holds related papers and charters from the archive of the [[Marquess of Tweeddale|Tweeddale]] archive, including the Lauderdale's marriage contract, and the executry papers MS 14547.</ref> A challenge to the administration of the will by a third-party William Dudley, demonstrating that goods belonged not to Lauderdale but to his daughter, and that the executors had not been lawfully appointed, failed in 1658.

As an ardent Party supporter, he worked vigorously to gain noble and royal support for it, and eventually became an upper privy councillor and [[adjutant]] to Propaganda Minister [[Joseph Goebbels]]. In 1939, Friedrich Christian was asked to become king of [[Iceland]] by Icelanders sympathetic to the Nazi party, but refused due to the opposition of Foreign Minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]].\n\nAfter [[World War II]], the prince devoted his writings to defending the record of the Third Reich, producing such works as ''Was Hitler Really a Dictator?'' (a personal account of the German leader) and ''\"Als die goldne Abendsonne...\" Aus meinen Tageb\u00fcchern der Jahre 1933\u20131937'' (the prince's personal diaries).\n\n==Family and early life==\nPrince Friedrich Christian of Schaumburg-Lippe was the eighth and youngest son of [[Georg, Prince of Schaumburg-Lippe|Georg]], the reigning Prince of Schaumburg-Lippe, and his consort [[Princess Marie Anne of Saxe-Altenburg]].

A year before the founding, the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] pushed for the need to advance the systematic study of [[social sciences]] as well. In fact, [[Sidney Webb|Sidney]] and [[Beatrice Webb]] used the curriculum of the [[Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris]] (best known as ''\"[[Sciences Po]]\"''), which covered the full range of the social sciences, as part of their inspiration for moulding the LSE's educational purpose. LSE was opened in October 1895 at No. 9 John Street, [[Adelphi, London|Adelphi]], originally as a [[continuing education|night school]] to bring higher education to the working classes.\n\n[[File:LondonSchoolofEconomics cford.jpg|thumb|left|The LSE's arms appear above the main entrance to the Old Building, which opened in 1922.]]\n\nThe School expanded rapidly and was moved along with its newly established library, the [[British Library of Political and Economic Science]] to No. 10 Adelphi Terrace in September 1896, continuing to expand through the next couple of years thanks to Shaw. In 1902, [[Coefficients (dining club)|The Coefficients]] dining club was regularly meeting in the Library, and they affected the development of LSE along with the Fabians and the [[Suffragettes]] movement (who also first met at LSE). In 1900, the School became officially recognised as a Faculty of Economics within the much larger [[University of London]] in Bloomsbury, and began enrolling students for bachelor's degrees and doctorates in the same year.  At the same time, the LSE began expanding into other areas of [[social sciences]], including, initially, geography (in 1902) and philosophy (in 1903), pioneering the study of [[international relations]], as well as teaching [[history]], [[law]], [[psychology]] and [[sociology]]. By 1902, it was apparent the School had and would continue to outgrow its Adelphi Terrace location, and moved to its present campus in [[Clare Market]] off the [[Aldwych]] and aside [[Kingsway (London)|Kingsway]] - not far from [[Whitehall]], in 1902.

LSE in this sense must be looked at as the father of modern economics studies. Under Beveridge, [[Friedrich Hayek]] was appointed as a professor and he brought about the ascendancy of the LSE through his famous debates with [[John Maynard Keynes]].\n\nIn 1939, with the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], LSE's Houghton Street campus became home to the Ministry for Economic Warfare, whilst following discussions between school Director, Carr-Saunders and [[Winston Churchill]], it was agreed to temporarily relocate the school to Cambridge, where it took over [[Peterhouse]].

Hayek's works continue to influence the study of economics across the globe. At the other extreme, during these years [[Harold Joseph Laski]], a professor of political science at the LSE was influential in British politics as an advocate of far left policies.

Hayek's works continue to influence the study of economics across the globe. At the other extreme, during these years [[Harold Joseph Laski]], a professor of political science at the LSE was influential in British politics as an advocate of far left policies. Many renowned world leaders including [[John F. Kennedy]] (and his brother [[Robert F. Kennedy]]) studied under his guidance at the LSE.\n\n==Recent history==\n[[File:Anthony_Giddens_at_the_Progressive_Governance_Converence,_Budapest,_Hungary,_2004_October.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Sociologist [[Anthony Giddens]] is a recent former Director of the LSE, and a key proponent of [[Third Way (centrism)|third way]] politics.]]\n\nWhile the LSE's initial reputation was that of a socialist-leaning institution, this had changed by the 1960s, with LSE Director [[Walter Adams (historian)|Walter Adams]] fighting hard to remove LSE from its Fabian roots. This led to many [[student protests]], which also involved [[Lionel Robbins]], who had returned to LSE as chairman of governors, having been a member of staff for many years.\n\n[[Anthony Giddens]], the former Director of the LSE, stands as the creator of the [[Third way (centrism)|\"Third Way\"]] followed by both [[Tony Blair]] (who unveiled the [[Fabian Window]] at LSE in 2005) and [[Bill Clinton]].

They were closely related to, or a subdivision of, the [[Goths]].\n\nThey are first mentioned by Roman sources in the third century. In the 4th century, they were among the peoples incorporated into the [[Huns|Hunnic Empire]], within which they formed one of the most important parts. After the death of [[Attila]], the Gepids under their leader [[Ardaric]], led an alliance of other peoples who had been in the empire, and defeated the sons of Attila and their remaining allies at the [[Battle of Nedao]] in 454. The Gepids and their allies subsequently founded kingdoms on the [[Middle Danube]], bordering on the [[Roman Empire]]. The '''Gepid Kingdom''', was one of the most important and long-lasting of these, centered on [[Sirmium]], and sometimes referred to as '''Gepidia'''.<ref>[[Jordanes]], ''[[Getica]]'', [https://www.ucalgary.ca/~vandersp/Courses/texts/jordgeti.html#XII XII.74]: ''Haec Gotia, quam Daciam appellavere maiores, quae nunc ut diximus Gepidia dicitur''. Rough translation: \"This [[Dacia|Gothia]], which our ancestors called [[Dacia]], we now call [[Gepidia]].\"</ref> It covered a large part of the [[Roman Dacia|former Roman province of Dacia]], north of the Danube, and compared to other Middle Danubian kingdoms it remained relatively un-involved with Rome. \n\nThe Gepids were defeated by the [[Kingdom of the Lombards|Lombards]] and [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]] a century later in 567,[[Constantinople]] giving no support to the Gepids. Some Gepids joined the Lombards in their subsequent conquest of Italy, some moved into Roman territory, and other Gepids still lived in the area of the old kingdom after it was conquered by the Avars.\n\n==Name==\nThe most common Latin spellings of the Gepid name in plural used a \"p\", but varied concerning the vowels: Gepidae, Gipidae, Gipedae, Gipides. Similarly, Procopius writing in Greek uses a stem \u03b3\u03b7\u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4- which should be transliterated as Giped-. All these forms are interpreted by modern linguists as Gothic-influenced. Forms from [[Lombard language|Langobard]], [[Old Norse]] and [[Old English]] however indicate that the \"p\" was really a \"b\" sound, and modern linguists reconstruct the original Germanic form as *''G\u00edbidoz'', based on the Germanic verb \"to give\" (as still found in English) and apparently indicating that they named themselves gifted or rewarded or generous.{{sfn|Neumann|1998}}\n\nThe Gepids are generally equated to the people mentioned in the Old English ''[[Widsith]]'' and ''[[Beowulf]]'', as ''{{lang|ang|Gif\u00f0as}}'' or {{lang|ang|Gef\u00feas}}. These names are etymologically equivalent Old English forms of Gepidae; they could not have arisen through borrowing from attested Latin forms.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Neidorf |first=Leonard |title=The Gepids in Beowulf |journal=ANQ |pages=1\u20134 |year=2019 |doi=10.1080/0895769X.2019.1584028}}</ref> [[Walter Goffart]] has objected to the identification of the Old English ''{{lang|ang|Gif\u00f0as}}'' and {{lang|ang|Gef\u00feas}} with the Gepids.<ref>{{harvnb|Goffart|2006|p=333}}: \"no serious arguments substantiating the identification seem to me to have been set out\".</ref>\n\n===Medieval etymologies===\n[[Jordanes]] in the 6th century, reported in his Gothic origins story the ''[[Getica]]'', that the name of the Gepids came from ''gepanta'', an insult in Gothic meaning \"sluggish, stolid\" (''pigra''), because the Gepids had lagged behind their Gothic kin when they migrated more than a thousand years earlier.<ref name = Yeat>{{cite web | author = Jordanes | title = Goths | publisher = Harbour net | language = Latin, English | others = Yeat, Theedrich ''tr.'' | url = http://www.harbornet.com/folks/theedrich/Goths/Goths1.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-03 | quote = For undoubtedly they too trace their origin from the stock of the Goths, but because, as I have said, ''gepanta'' means something slow and stolid, the name ''Giped'' arose as a spontaneous taunt.

The much later (12th century) Byzantine ''[[Etymologicum Magnum]]'' interprets the name using the Greek word for children, making the Gepids ''G\u0113t\u00edpaides'' (\u0393\u03b7\u03c4\u03af\u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2) meaning \"children of the Goths (equated to [[Getae]])\". All three of these texts follow a tradition of seeing the Gepids as \"offshoots or close relatives of the Goths\".<ref>See {{harvtxt|Pohl|1998|p=131}} (in German) and {{harvtxt|Goffart|2006|pp=199-200}} (in English).</ref>\n\n==Language==\n{{Infobox language | name =Gepid | altname =Gepidan<br>Gepidian | region = [[Dacia]] | ethnicity = Gepids | extinct = ? | familycolor =Indo-European | fam2 =[[Germanic languages|Germanic]] | fam3 = [[East Germanic languages|East Germanic]] | linglist =1el\n}}\nThere is little direct evidence for the original language of the Gepids, but they were clearly Gothic in culture during the period when the Romans reported upon them.

One of these three ships proved to be slower than the others, as is usually the case, and thus is said to have given the tribe their name, for in their language ''gepanta'' means slow. Hence it came to pass that gradually and by corruption the name Gepidae was coined for them by way of reproach.

They were closely related to, or a subdivision of, the [[Goths]].\n\nThey are first mentioned by Roman sources in the third century. In the 4th century, they were among the peoples incorporated into the [[Huns|Hunnic Empire]], within which they formed one of the most important parts. After the death of [[Attila]], the Gepids under their leader [[Ardaric]], led an alliance of other peoples who had been in the empire, and defeated the sons of Attila and their remaining allies at the [[Battle of Nedao]] in 454. The Gepids and their allies subsequently founded kingdoms on the [[Middle Danube]], bordering on the [[Roman Empire]]. The '''Gepid Kingdom''', was one of the most important and long-lasting of these, centered on [[Sirmium]], and sometimes referred to as '''Gepidia'''.<ref>[[Jordanes]], ''[[Getica]]'', [https://www.ucalgary.ca/~vandersp/Courses/texts/jordgeti.html#XII XII.74]: ''Haec Gotia, quam Daciam appellavere maiores, quae nunc ut diximus Gepidia dicitur''. Rough translation: \"This [[Dacia|Gothia]], which our ancestors called [[Dacia]], we now call [[Gepidia]].\"</ref> It covered a large part of the [[Roman Dacia|former Roman province of Dacia]], north of the Danube, and compared to other Middle Danubian kingdoms it remained relatively un-involved with Rome. \n\nThe Gepids were defeated by the [[Kingdom of the Lombards|Lombards]] and [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]] a century later in 567,[[Constantinople]] giving no support to the Gepids. Some Gepids joined the Lombards in their subsequent conquest of Italy, some moved into Roman territory, and other Gepids still lived in the area of the old kingdom after it was conquered by the Avars.\n\n==Name==\nThe most common Latin spellings of the Gepid name in plural used a \"p\", but varied concerning the vowels: Gepidae, Gipidae, Gipedae, Gipides. Similarly, Procopius writing in Greek uses a stem \u03b3\u03b7\u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4- which should be transliterated as Giped-. All these forms are interpreted by modern linguists as Gothic-influenced. Forms from [[Lombard language|Langobard]], [[Old Norse]] and [[Old English]] however indicate that the \"p\" was really a \"b\" sound, and modern linguists reconstruct the original Germanic form as *''G\u00edbidoz'', based on the Germanic verb \"to give\" (as still found in English) and apparently indicating that they named themselves gifted or rewarded or generous.{{sfn|Neumann|1998}}\n\nThe Gepids are generally equated to the people mentioned in the Old English ''[[Widsith]]'' and ''[[Beowulf]]'', as ''{{lang|ang|Gif\u00f0as}}'' or {{lang|ang|Gef\u00feas}}. These names are etymologically equivalent Old English forms of Gepidae; they could not have arisen through borrowing from attested Latin forms.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Neidorf |first=Leonard |title=The Gepids in Beowulf |journal=ANQ |pages=1\u20134 |year=2019 |doi=10.1080/0895769X.2019.1584028}}</ref> [[Walter Goffart]] has objected to the identification of the Old English ''{{lang|ang|Gif\u00f0as}}'' and {{lang|ang|Gef\u00feas}} with the Gepids.<ref>{{harvnb|Goffart|2006|p=333}}: \"no serious arguments substantiating the identification seem to me to have been set out\".</ref>\n\n===Medieval etymologies===\n[[Jordanes]] in the 6th century, reported in his Gothic origins story the ''[[Getica]]'', that the name of the Gepids came from ''gepanta'', an insult in Gothic meaning \"sluggish, stolid\" (''pigra''), because the Gepids had lagged behind their Gothic kin when they migrated more than a thousand years earlier.<ref name = Yeat>{{cite web | author = Jordanes | title = Goths | publisher = Harbour net | language = Latin, English | others = Yeat, Theedrich ''tr.'' | url = http://www.harbornet.com/folks/theedrich/Goths/Goths1.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-03 | quote = For undoubtedly they too trace their origin from the stock of the Goths, but because, as I have said, ''gepanta'' means something slow and stolid, the name ''Giped'' arose as a spontaneous taunt. I do not believe the name itself is very far from wrong, for they are slow of thought and too sluggish for quick movement of their bodies.}}</ref>\n\n[[Isidore of Seville]] in his etymologies, interpreted the second part of the Gepid name as \"feet\" (Latin ''pedes'') and explained that the Gepids were known for going into battle on foot (''pedestri''), rather than mounted.
