Although the Bichon breed type are originally Spanish, used as sailing dogs, also as herding dogs sometimes, the French developed them into a gentle [[Lap dog|lap-dog]] variety. The Bichon type arose from the [[water dog]]s, and is descended from the [[poodle]]-type dogs<!--Do not say \"Standard Poodle\" here; not possible, since the modern standardized poodle breeds did not exist then.--> and either the [[Barbet (dog)|Barbet]] or one of the [[Water spaniel (disambiguation)|water spaniel]] class of breeds. Modern Bichons have developed into four categories: the Bichon Frise or Tenerife, the [[Maltese dog|Maltese]], the [[Bolognese dog|Bolognese]], and the [[Havanese dog|Havanese]], often treated as separate breeds.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.thesprucepets.com/bichon-frise-dog-breed-profile-1117940| title=Bichon Frise: Dog Breed Profile| last=Stregowski | first=Jenny | work=sprucepets.com}}</ref>\n\nBecause of their merry disposition, the ancestral Bichons travelled much and were often used as [[barter]] by [[Italy|Italian]] sailors as they moved from continent to continent.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/66745/11-fluffy-facts-about-bichon-frise| title=11 Fluffy Facts About the Bichon Frise| work=mentalfloss.com}}</ref> The dogs found early success in [[Spain]] and it is generally believed that Spanish seamen introduced the early breed to the [[Tenerife]] in the [[Canary Islands]]. In the 14th century, Italian sailors rediscovered the dogs on their voyages and are credited with returning them to continental Europe,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bichon.org/history-of-the-bichon-frise/ |title=History of the Bichon Frise |work=bichon.org}}</ref> where they became great favorites of Italian nobility. As was the style with dogs in the courts, their coats were cut \"lion style\", like a modern-day [[Portuguese Water Dog]].\n\nThe Tenerife, often simply called the Bichon, had success in [[France]] during the [[Renaissance]] under [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] (1515\u20131547), but its popularity increased in the court of [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] (1574\u20131589), when it had become popular amongst French nobility as both a court companion and lap dog.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.dogproductpicker.com/bichon-frise-breed-info/| title=Bichon Frise Breed Information - All You Need To Know}}</ref> The breed also enjoyed considerable success in Spain as a favorite of the [[Infanta]]s and painters of the Spanish school often included them in their works. For example, the famous artist, [[Francisco de Goya]], included a Bichon in several of his works.\n\nInterest in the breed was renewed during the rule of [[Napoleon III]], but then waned until the late 19th century when it became the \"common dog\", running the streets, accompanying the [[organ grinder]]s of Barbary, leading the [[Blindness|blind]], and doing tricks in circuses and fairs.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.purina.com.au/dogs/breeds/bichon-frise#.XSeK8OtKi70| title=Bichon Frise| work=purina.com.au}}</ref> After World War I, they had begun to become popular again in France and were bred by French breeders.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.britannica.com/animal/bichon-frise#ref191395| title=Bichon Frise| work=britannica.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.smartfarmzone.com/bichon-frise-king-henry-iiis-favorite-pet-dog/| title=Bichon Frise: Henry III's Favorite Pet Dog| work=smartfarmzone.com}}</ref>\n\nOn 5 March 1933, the official standard of the breed was adopted by the [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Centrale Canine]], the national kennel club for France.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/bichon-frise/detail/#history |title=Bichon Frise Page |work=AKC.org |publisher=[[American Kennel Club]] |date=2012 |accessdate=10 October 2012}}</ref> This was largely due to the success of the French-speaking Belgian author [[Herg\u00e9]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'', which featured a small, fluffy, white [[fox terrier]] dog named Milou (Snowy in the English editions). As the breed was known by two names at that time, Tenerife and Bichon, the president of the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale]] proposed a name based on the characteristics that the dogs presented \u2013 the Bichon \u00c0 Poil Fris\u00e9, later shortened to Bichon Fris\u00e9. (\"Fris\u00e9\" means \"curly\", referring to the breed's coat.) On 18 October 1934, the Bichon Fris\u00e9 was admitted to the [[stud book]] of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Centrale Canine.\n\nThe Bichon was brought to the [[United States]] in 1955.<ref name=\":0\" /> The first US-born Bichon litter was whelped in 1956. In 1959 and 1960, two breeders in different parts of the US acquired Bichons, which provided the origins for the breed's further development in that country.\n\nThe Bichon Frise became eligible to enter the AKC's Miscellaneous Class on 1 September 1971. In October 1972, the breed was admitted to registration in the ''American Kennel Club Stud Book''. On 4 April 1973, the breed became eligible to show in the Non-Sporting Group at AKC [[Conformation show|dog shows]]. In 2001, a Bichon Frise named J.R. won best-in-show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. In the United States, the Bichon Frise was ranked the 40th most popular breed in 2013 according to the [[American Kennel Club]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.akc.org/news/the-most-popular-dog-breeds-in-america/ |work=AKC.org |publisher=American Kennel Club |title=2013 Dog Registration Statistics Historical Comparisons & Notable Trends |date=2014 |access-date=30 April 2014}}</ref> \n\nThe Bichon was introduced into Australia in the 1970s and since its introduction has proved successful as both a show and companion dog.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pedigree.com.au/dog-breed-information/dog-breed-gallery/Bichon-Frise/| title=Bichon Frise| work=pedigree.com}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n\n=== Appearance ===\n[[File:Toby the Bichon Fris\u00e9.jpg|thumb|Bichon Frise in a pet trim]]\n\nThe Bichon Frise is a small dog that weighs approximately 5\u201310&nbsp;kg (10\u201320&nbsp;lbs) and stands 23\u201330&nbsp;cm (9\u201312&nbsp;in) at the [[withers]], but slightly larger dogs are not uncommon. The skull is slightly rounded and the muzzle is not pointy. The tail is groomed to be long and curly and is carried over the back. It has a black nose and dark round eyes; its white hair consists of a curly, dense coat with little shedding (much like a poodle in this respect), although many of the breed do tend to have less curly hair than others. A small amount of buff, cream, or apricot colour may be seen around its ears, snout, paws or body, but normally these colours do not exceed 10% of its body. FCI/AKC Standard coat colour is pure white; other colours such as apricot or grey are not recognised. A white coat is preferred in the show ring. The head and legs are proportionate in size to the body, and the ears and tail are natural (not [[Docking (animal)|''docked'']] or ''cropped'').<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.fci.be/uploaded_files/215gb98_en.doc |publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale]] |work=FCI.be |title=FCI-Standard No. 215: Bichon Frise (Bichon \u00e0 poil fris\u00e9) |date=11 May 1998 |access-date=20 February 2018 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120831203023/http://www.fci.be/uploaded_files/215gb98_en.doc |archive-date=31 August 2012}}</ref> The coat is trimmed often to make the hair seem like an even length. Bichon Frises can have a [[dog intelligence|medium-high intelligence]]. they are sometimes found in grocery stores eating radishes\n\n===Temperament===\n\nThe [[American Kennel Club]] refers to the Bichon Frise as \"merry\" and \"curious\",<ref name=\":0\" /> and the breed standard calls for a dog that is \"gentle mannered, sensitive, playful and affectionate.\" The dogs are generally very sociable and do well with an owner who takes them along on outings and are affectionate and intelligent. Bichons do well with children because they are playful and have lots of energy. If affiliated with a particular territory and encouraged by owners, they can become very territorial.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/bichon-frise/ |title=Meet the Breeds: Bichon Frise |work=AKC.org |publisher=American Kennel Club |date=2012 |access-date=10 October 2012}}</ref> Developed as a companion-dog breed, the Bichon Frise tends to get along well with both children and other animals. Bichon Frises are very obedient if training is started early and continued constantly.\n\nThough not considered a [[retriever]] or a water dog by modern standards, the Bichon type, due to their ancestry as sailors' dogs, have an affinity for water and enjoy retrieving. On the boats, however, the animals' role was that of [[companion dog]].\n\n===Grooming===\n[[File:Honey Dreams Dancer & Sahra.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Two Bichons Frises in Show Cut]] Bichon Frises have coats that require a diligent grooming schedule. Grooming helps remove loose hair, and the curl in the coat helps prevent dead hair and [[dander]] from escaping into the environment, as with the poodle's coat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dogplay.com/Articles/MyArticles/hair_vs_fur.html |title=Hair vs Fur |publisher=Dogplay.com |date= |accessdate=10 October 2012}}</ref> The coat is combed to remove loose hair, mats, and tangles. Bichon Frises may need grooming approximately every four to eight weeks. This breed tends to have hair growing within the ear canals, that if not plucked regularly, can trap moisture, bacteria, and yeast, creating an unbalanced microbiome in the ear. This may lead to excessive head shaking, causing an ear hematoma. As Bichon Frises are white dogs, frequent bathing is required to maintain the colour.\n\nBichon Frises are considered to be [[hypoallergenic]] as they do not readily shed ([[moult]]).<ref name=\"Gopets\">{{cite web |url= http://www.gopetsamerica.com/dogs/dogs-that-do-not-shed.aspx |title=Dogs that do not shed \u2013 Retrieved 7 September 2008 |publisher=Go Pets America |date=25 July 2010 |accessdate=10 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.dogmal.com/hypoallergenic-dog-breeds/| title=Top 15 Hypoallergenic Dog Breeds| work=dogmal.com}}</ref> Bichon Frises are suitable for people with allergies.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.akc.org/about/faq-allergies/ |title=Dogs and Allergies |work=AKC.org |publisher=American Kennel Club |date=2012 |access-date=10 October 2012}}</ref> It is important to note that human sensitivity to dog fur, dander, and saliva varies considerably. Although hair, dander, and saliva can be minimised, they are still present and can stick to \"clothes and the carpets and furnishings in your home\"; inhaling the allergens, or being licked by the dog, can trigger a reaction in a sensitive person.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/pet-allergy/DS00859/DSECTION=causes |title=Pet allergy \u2013 Symptoms and causes |publisher=[[Mayo Clinic]] |work=MayoClinic.com |access-date=11 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bichon Frise.jpg|thumb|Bichon Frise, Pet Cut]]\n\n===Lifespan===\nBichon Frises in the UK, the United States, and Canada (according to surveys of their owners) have an average life span of about 12\u201313 years or older, with Bichon Frises in the UK tending to live longer than Bichon Frises in North America, though the record age was lower in the UK.<ref name=\"Cassidy Data\">{{cite web |url= http://users.pullman.com/lostriver/breeddata.htm |work=Dog Longevity |title=Breed Longevity Data |editor-first=Kelly M. |editor-last=Cassidy |date=1 February 2008 |access-date=20 February 2018}}{{self-published source|reason=Just some vet's personal website.

Sammi was an American Kennel Club approved dog sourced from St Louis Missouri and died peacefully surrounded by her family with the care of the Northbrook Animal Clinic.\n\nIn a 2004 UK Kennel Club survey, the leading causes of Bichon Frise death were old age (23.5%) and cancer (21%).<ref name=\"KC Survey\" /> In a 2007 US/Canadian breeders survey, the leading causes of death were cancer (22%), unknown causes (14%), hematologic (11%), and old age (10%).<ref name=\"BFCA surveys\" /> Hematologic causes of death were divided between [[autoimmune hemolytic anemia]] (AIHA) and immune-mediated [[thrombocytopenia]] (ITP). AIHA and ITP were responsible for the greatest number of Bichon Frise \"years lost\" (a measure of the extent to which a condition kills members of a breed prematurely). While cancer is a more common cause of death than AIHA and ITP, Bichon Frises that died of cancer died at a median age of 12.5 years.<ref name=\"BFCA surveys\" /> Hematologic deaths occurred at a median age of only 5 years. Bichon Frises in the UK survey had a lower rate of hematologic deaths (3%) than in the USA/Canada survey (11%).<ref name=\"KC Survey\" />\n\n=== Health concerns ===\nBichon Frises are prone to scratching and chewing on themselves in the summer because of the warm and moist air, which commonly results in serious skin conditions. They are comparatively hypoallergenic, but they themselves suffer from allergies to fleas, ticks, chemicals, pollen, dust, etc. Loose knee joints, ear infections, cataracts, diabetes, and heart disease are also common.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bichonhealth.org/Health.htm|title=Bichon Frise Club of America - Health Resource Center - Health Articles|website=Bichonhealth.org|accessdate=11 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nBichons are also prone to [[liver shunt]]s. These often go undetected until later in life, leading to complications that cannot be addressed, and therefore liver failure. Bichons who are underweight, runts of the litter, or have negative reactions to foods high in protein are more likely to be suffering from a shunt. When detected early, shunt often can be corrected through surgery. However, the later in life the shunt is detected, the lower the likelihood of surgery being successful. Shunts can be kept under control through special low-protein diets and through medications to support liver function, help flush toxins that build up in the kidneys and liver, and control seizures that often occur as a symptom of the shunt. Without surgery, Bichons with shunts on average live to be 4\u20136 years old. Other symptoms include dark urine, lethargy, loss of appetite, and increased thirst. Seizures come in all forms; episodes of seizures can begin early in life but may go undetected. Early seizures can appear as a hypnotic state or an episode of vertigo. \n\n===AIHA and ITP===\nAutoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA, also called immune-mediated hemolytic anemia, or IMHA) and immune-mediated thrombocytopenia (ITP) are responsible for many premature Bichon Frise deaths. These diseases can strike with little or no warning and kill very quickly. In AIHA, the dog's immune system attacks its own red blood cells, leading to severe, life-threatening anemia. Symptoms include weakness, loss of energy, lack of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, rapid heart rate, rapid breathing, dark urine, and pale or yellow gums.<ref name=\"McDonald\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bichonhealth.org/HealthInfo/Hemolytic.asp |title=Immune Mediated Hemolytic Anemia |first=Nancy |last=McDonald |work=BichonHealth.org |publisher=Bichon Frise Club of America |date=2013 |access-date=20 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928131226/http://www.bichonhealth.org/HealthInfo/Hemolytic.asp |archive-date=28 September 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nITP often accompanies AIHA.<ref name=\"Merck Veterinary Manual\">[http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/60205.htm Merck Veterinary Manual online.

Although the Bichon breed type are originally Spanish, used as sailing dogs, also as herding dogs sometimes, the French developed them into a gentle [[Lap dog|lap-dog]] variety. The Bichon type arose from the [[water dog]]s, and is descended from the [[poodle]]-type dogs<!--Do not say \"Standard Poodle\" here; not possible, since the modern standardized poodle breeds did not exist then.--> and either the [[Barbet (dog)|Barbet]] or one of the [[Water spaniel (disambiguation)|water spaniel]] class of breeds. Modern Bichons have developed into four categories: the Bichon Frise or Tenerife, the [[Maltese dog|Maltese]], the [[Bolognese dog|Bolognese]], and the [[Havanese dog|Havanese]], often treated as separate breeds.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.thesprucepets.com/bichon-frise-dog-breed-profile-1117940| title=Bichon Frise: Dog Breed Profile| last=Stregowski | first=Jenny | work=sprucepets.com}}</ref>\n\nBecause of their merry disposition, the ancestral Bichons travelled much and were often used as [[barter]] by [[Italy|Italian]] sailors as they moved from continent to continent.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/66745/11-fluffy-facts-about-bichon-frise| title=11 Fluffy Facts About the Bichon Frise| work=mentalfloss.com}}</ref> The dogs found early success in [[Spain]] and it is generally believed that Spanish seamen introduced the early breed to the [[Tenerife]] in the [[Canary Islands]]. In the 14th century, Italian sailors rediscovered the dogs on their voyages and are credited with returning them to continental Europe,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bichon.org/history-of-the-bichon-frise/ |title=History of the Bichon Frise |work=bichon.org}}</ref> where they became great favorites of Italian nobility. As was the style with dogs in the courts, their coats were cut \"lion style\", like a modern-day [[Portuguese Water Dog]].\n\nThe Tenerife, often simply called the Bichon, had success in [[France]] during the [[Renaissance]] under [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] (1515\u20131547), but its popularity increased in the court of [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] (1574\u20131589), when it had become popular amongst French nobility as both a court companion and lap dog.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.dogproductpicker.com/bichon-frise-breed-info/| title=Bichon Frise Breed Information - All You Need To Know}}</ref> The breed also enjoyed considerable success in Spain as a favorite of the [[Infanta]]s and painters of the Spanish school often included them in their works. For example, the famous artist, [[Francisco de Goya]], included a Bichon in several of his works.\n\nInterest in the breed was renewed during the rule of [[Napoleon III]], but then waned until the late 19th century when it became the \"common dog\", running the streets, accompanying the [[organ grinder]]s of Barbary, leading the [[Blindness|blind]], and doing tricks in circuses and fairs.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.purina.com.au/dogs/breeds/bichon-frise#.XSeK8OtKi70| title=Bichon Frise| work=purina.com.au}}</ref> After World War I, they had begun to become popular again in France and were bred by French breeders.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.britannica.com/animal/bichon-frise#ref191395| title=Bichon Frise| work=britannica.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.smartfarmzone.com/bichon-frise-king-henry-iiis-favorite-pet-dog/| title=Bichon Frise: Henry III's Favorite Pet Dog| work=smartfarmzone.com}}</ref>\n\nOn 5 March 1933, the official standard of the breed was adopted by the [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Centrale Canine]], the national kennel club for France.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/bichon-frise/detail/#history |title=Bichon Frise Page |work=AKC.org |publisher=[[American Kennel Club]] |date=2012 |accessdate=10 October 2012}}</ref> This was largely due to the success of the French-speaking Belgian author [[Herg\u00e9]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'', which featured a small, fluffy, white [[fox terrier]] dog named Milou (Snowy in the English editions). As the breed was known by two names at that time, Tenerife and Bichon, the president of the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale]] proposed a name based on the characteristics that the dogs presented \u2013 the Bichon \u00c0 Poil Fris\u00e9, later shortened to Bichon Fris\u00e9. (\"Fris\u00e9\" means \"curly\", referring to the breed's coat.) On 18 October 1934, the Bichon Fris\u00e9 was admitted to the [[stud book]] of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Centrale Canine.\n\nThe Bichon was brought to the [[United States]] in 1955.<ref name=\":0\" /> The first US-born Bichon litter was whelped in 1956. In 1959 and 1960, two breeders in different parts of the US acquired Bichons, which provided the origins for the breed's further development in that country.\n\nThe Bichon Frise became eligible to enter the AKC's Miscellaneous Class on 1 September 1971. In October 1972, the breed was admitted to registration in the ''American Kennel Club Stud Book''. On 4 April 1973, the breed became eligible to show in the Non-Sporting Group at AKC [[Conformation show|dog shows]]. In 2001, a Bichon Frise named J.R. won best-in-show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. In the United States, the Bichon Frise was ranked the 40th most popular breed in 2013 according to the [[American Kennel Club]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.akc.org/news/the-most-popular-dog-breeds-in-america/ |work=AKC.org |publisher=American Kennel Club |title=2013 Dog Registration Statistics Historical Comparisons & Notable Trends |date=2014 |access-date=30 April 2014}}</ref> \n\nThe Bichon was introduced into Australia in the 1970s and since its introduction has proved successful as both a show and companion dog.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pedigree.com.au/dog-breed-information/dog-breed-gallery/Bichon-Frise/| title=Bichon Frise| work=pedigree.com}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n\n=== Appearance ===\n[[File:Toby the Bichon Fris\u00e9.jpg|thumb|Bichon Frise in a pet trim]]\n\nThe Bichon Frise is a small dog that weighs approximately 5\u201310&nbsp;kg (10\u201320&nbsp;lbs) and stands 23\u201330&nbsp;cm (9\u201312&nbsp;in) at the [[withers]], but slightly larger dogs are not uncommon. The skull is slightly rounded and the muzzle is not pointy. The tail is groomed to be long and curly and is carried over the back. It has a black nose and dark round eyes; its white hair consists of a curly, dense coat with little shedding (much like a poodle in this respect), although many of the breed do tend to have less curly hair than others. A small amount of buff, cream, or apricot colour may be seen around its ears, snout, paws or body, but normally these colours do not exceed 10% of its body. FCI/AKC Standard coat colour is pure white; other colours such as apricot or grey are not recognised. A white coat is preferred in the show ring. The head and legs are proportionate in size to the body, and the ears and tail are natural (not [[Docking (animal)|''docked'']] or ''cropped'').<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.fci.be/uploaded_files/215gb98_en.doc |publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale]] |work=FCI.be |title=FCI-Standard No. 215: Bichon Frise (Bichon \u00e0 poil fris\u00e9) |date=11 May 1998 |access-date=20 February 2018 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120831203023/http://www.fci.be/uploaded_files/215gb98_en.doc |archive-date=31 August 2012}}</ref> The coat is trimmed often to make the hair seem like an even length. Bichon Frises can have a [[dog intelligence|medium-high intelligence]].\n\n===Temperament===\n\nThe [[American Kennel Club]] refers to the Bichon Frise as \"merry\" and \"curious\",<ref name=\":0\" /> and the breed standard calls for a dog that is \"gentle mannered, sensitive, playful and affectionate.\" The dogs are generally very sociable and do well with an owner who takes them along on outings and are affectionate and intelligent. Bichons do well with children because they are playful and have lots of energy. If affiliated with a particular territory and encouraged by owners, they can become very territorial.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/bichon-frise/ |title=Meet the Breeds: Bichon Frise |work=AKC.org |publisher=American Kennel Club |date=2012 |access-date=10 October 2012}}</ref> Developed as a companion-dog breed, the Bichon Frise tends to get along well with both children and other animals. Bichon Frises are very obedient if training is started early and continued constantly.\n\nThough not considered a [[retriever]] or a water dog by modern standards, the Bichon type, due to their ancestry as sailors' dogs, have an affinity for water and enjoy retrieving. On the boats, however, the animals' role was that of [[companion dog]].\n\n===Grooming===\n[[File:Honey Dreams Dancer & Sahra.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Two Bichons Frises in Show Cut]] Bichon Frises have coats that require a diligent grooming schedule. Grooming helps remove loose hair, and the curl in the coat helps prevent dead hair and [[dander]] from escaping into the environment, as with the poodle's coat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dogplay.com/Articles/MyArticles/hair_vs_fur.html |title=Hair vs Fur |publisher=Dogplay.com |date= |accessdate=10 October 2012}}</ref> The coat is combed to remove loose hair, mats, and tangles. Bichon Frises may need grooming approximately every four to eight weeks. This breed tends to have hair growing within the ear canals, that if not plucked regularly, can trap moisture, bacteria, and yeast, creating an unbalanced microbiome in the ear. This may lead to excessive head shaking, causing an ear hematoma. As Bichon Frises are white dogs, frequent bathing is required to maintain the colour.\n\nBichon Frises are considered to be [[hypoallergenic]] as they do not readily shed ([[moult]]).<ref name=\"Gopets\">{{cite web |url= http://www.gopetsamerica.com/dogs/dogs-that-do-not-shed.aspx |title=Dogs that do not shed \u2013 Retrieved 7 September 2008 |publisher=Go Pets America |date=25 July 2010 |accessdate=10 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.dogmal.com/hypoallergenic-dog-breeds/| title=Top 15 Hypoallergenic Dog Breeds| work=dogmal.com}}</ref> Bichon Frises are suitable for people with allergies.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.akc.org/about/faq-allergies/ |title=Dogs and Allergies |work=AKC.org |publisher=American Kennel Club |date=2012 |access-date=10 October 2012}}</ref> It is important to note that human sensitivity to dog fur, dander, and saliva varies considerably.

Sammi was an American Kennel Club approved dog sourced from St Louis Missouri and died peacefully surrounded by her family with the care of the Northbrook Animal Clinic.\n\nIn a 2004 UK Kennel Club survey, the leading causes of Bichon Frise death were old age (23.5%) and cancer (21%).<ref name=\"KC Survey\" /> In a 2007 US/Canadian breeders survey, the leading causes of death were cancer (22%), unknown causes (14%), hematologic (11%), and old age (10%).<ref name=\"BFCA surveys\" /> Hematologic causes of death were divided between [[autoimmune hemolytic anemia]] (AIHA) and immune-mediated [[thrombocytopenia]] (ITP). AIHA and ITP were responsible for the greatest number of Bichon Frise \"years lost\" (a measure of the extent to which a condition kills members of a breed prematurely). While cancer is a more common cause of death than AIHA and ITP, Bichon Frises that died of cancer died at a median age of 12.5 years.<ref name=\"BFCA surveys\" /> Hematologic deaths occurred at a median age of only 5 years. Bichon Frises in the UK survey had a lower rate of hematologic deaths (3%) than in the USA/Canada survey (11%).<ref name=\"KC Survey\" />\n\n=== Health concerns ===\nBichon Frises are prone to scratching and chewing on themselves in the summer because of the warm and moist air, which commonly results in serious skin conditions. They are comparatively hypoallergenic, but they themselves suffer from allergies to fleas, ticks, chemicals, pollen, dust, etc. Loose knee joints, ear infections, cataracts, diabetes, and heart disease are also common.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bichonhealth.org/Health.htm|title=Bichon Frise Club of America - Health Resource Center - Health Articles|website=Bichonhealth.org|accessdate=11 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nBichons are also prone to [[liver shunt]]s. These often go undetected until later in life, leading to complications that cannot be addressed, and therefore liver failure. Bichons who are underweight, runts of the litter, or have negative reactions to foods high in protein are more likely to be suffering from a shunt. When detected early, shunt often can be corrected through surgery. However, the later in life the shunt is detected, the lower the likelihood of surgery being successful. Shunts can be kept under control through special low-protein diets and through medications to support liver function, help flush toxins that build up in the kidneys and liver, and control seizures that often occur as a symptom of the shunt. Without surgery, Bichons with shunts on average live to be 4\u20136 years old. Other symptoms include dark urine, lethargy, loss of appetite, and increased thirst. Seizures come in all forms; episodes of seizures can begin early in life but may go undetected. Early seizures can appear as a hypnotic state or an episode of vertigo. \n\n===AIHA and ITP===\nAutoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA, also called immune-mediated hemolytic anemia, or IMHA) and immune-mediated thrombocytopenia (ITP) are responsible for many premature Bichon Frise deaths. These diseases can strike with little or no warning and kill very quickly. In AIHA, the dog's immune system attacks its own red blood cells, leading to severe, life-threatening anemia. Symptoms include weakness, loss of energy, lack of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, rapid heart rate, rapid breathing, dark urine, and pale or yellow gums.<ref name=\"McDonald\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bichonhealth.org/HealthInfo/Hemolytic.asp |title=Immune Mediated Hemolytic Anemia |first=Nancy |last=McDonald |work=BichonHealth.org |publisher=Bichon Frise Club of America |date=2013 |access-date=20 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928131226/http://www.bichonhealth.org/HealthInfo/Hemolytic.asp |archive-date=28 September 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nITP often accompanies AIHA.<ref name=\"Merck Veterinary Manual\">[http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/60205.htm Merck Veterinary Manual online.

Ivan leaves the room while Raymond talks with Delaney and learns that she came to Erinsborough to see Leo Tanaka, as she fell in love with him while he was working at Raymond's club in Sydney. She then tells him that Leo was the one who went to the police about his money laundering, not Mannix. Raymond and Ivan decide to shoot Leo, and Raymond tells Ivan to get Leo alone so there are no witnesses. Ivan finds Leo in The Waterhole and fires the gun, but Terese Willis jumps in front of Leo taking the bullet. Ivan flees the scene and calls Raymond to tell him what happened. Raymond leaves Delaney and comes down to the complex, where he spots Leo and the police. He enters Harold's Caf\u00e9 and the customers assume he is just a hotel guest. [[Mark Brennan (Neighbours)|Mark Brennan]] ([[Scott McGregor (model)|Scott McGregor]]) and [[Ned Willis]] (Ben Hall) find Ivan on Power Road trying to break into a car. Mark confronts him and Ned tackles him to the ground.\n\nRaymond tries to leave the caf\u00e9, but [[Elly Conway]] ([[Jodi Anasta]]) tells him to stay put as the police are continuing to sweep the area for Ivan's partner. She later tells him that he can go, but he notices that she does not tell anyone else and realises that she knows the police are looking for him. He pulls out his gun and orders Elly to collect all the phones, [[Yashvi Rebecchi]] (Olivia Junkeer) to lock the door and [[Chloe Brennan (Neighbours)|Chloe Brennan]] ([[April Rose Pengilly]]) to barricade it. He then hears [[Kirsha Rebecchi]] (Vani Dhir) on the phone to the police. He orders everyone to get on the ground, and asks the police to get him a van. Elly convinces him that he cannot take all the hostages with him, and he eventually lets an older couple and the children go. She tells him to just take her with him, but Chloe argues that he should take her instead. Raymond fires the gun at the ceiling and tells them to shut up. Leo comes to the caf\u00e9 and Raymond lets him inside, where he confronts his role in sending him and Ivan to prison. Leo asks him to think about Delaney, but Raymond refuses to listen and raises his gun to shoot just as the police come inside and tackle him to the ground.

Aaron later talks with Vera about how he and David have fallen in love with Regina, and he offers to buy her. Vera tells him that Regina was bequeathed to her, and if he wants Regina then they will have to go through a judge. David and Aaron eventually decide to let Regina go with Vera, who presents them with a vets bill before leaving for Bendigo. Vera later meets with [[Melissa Lohan]] (Jacqui Purvis) about selling Valerie's house. She then walks through the Lassiter's complex where [[Leo Tanaka]] (Tim Kano) is vandalising a Valentine's Day display. He throws a large floral display which hits Vera and knocks her to the ground. Leo's family see that she is okay and ask her not to call the police. [[Sheila Canning]] ([[Colette Mann]]) talks with Vera and asks her not to sue Leo. She mentions that his father [[Paul Robinson (Neighbours)|Paul Robinson]] ([[Stefan Dennis]]) is actually the one with the money, and implies the accident could have happened to anyone with all the decorations hanging up, so Vera sues Lassiters. Vera comes to Lassiters to hear a public apology from Leo, but he gets into an argument with Paul and [[Terese Willis]] ([[Rebekah Elmaloglou]]), causing Vera to leave.

Mel comes to [[Ramsay Street]] to see Chloe, who shuts the door on her and refuses to talk to her. Mel tells Aaron that she is remorseful for stealing from Chloe and leaving her in debt, so he arranges for them to talk. Mel apologises to Chloe for leaving her and tells her she will pay her back. Chloe and Mel agree to be friends again. Mel reads about the Robinson Pines housing development and introduces herself to Paul Robinson in the hope of securing a job as a sales agent, but Paul turns her down as his daughter [[Amy Williams (Neighbours)|Amy Williams]] ([[Zoe Cramond]]) has a team in place.

Bea accuses Mel of starting the fire, after seeing her giving money to Heath. Lucas later agrees to sell the garage, along with other Power Road business owners. Chloe also accuses Mel of starting the fire, after learning that she threw out a faulty power board from Number 24. Mel denies everything, but Chloe tells her that she no longer trusts her and ends their relationship. Mel replies that no one will want Chloe when she becomes sick and leaves. Elly confronts Mel the following day for almost killing her sister, but Mel accuses her of undermining her relationship with Chloe, and threatens to tell Mark about the kiss.

They tell Paul and Terese that they are staying with friends, and set up camp away from the others. Harlow sends Gary a text message about Prue's lies. Harlow feels pressured to have sex by Hendrix and they argue. She leaves and comes across Bea, who is trapped in a mineshaft with a broken leg. Harlow jumps down to help, but she also becomes trapped. Finn returns to check if Bea is still alive and throw rocks down. He then throws a snake down, which bites Harlow when she and Bea try to catch it in a rucksack. Gary tries to save them, but is killed by Finn, who also pushes Elly into the mineshaft. The others eventually find them, and they jump down to avoid a fire that engulfs the island. After being rescued, Harlow is taken to Erinsborough Hospital and placed in an induced coma. Paul blames Hendrix for Harlow's condition and initially bans him from seeing her. After waking up from her coma, Harlow listens to a voicemail on her phone, that was left by Prue and hears an explosion. She asks Paul where her mother is, and he tells her that she died. They later learn that she was killed by a bomb that Finn had left for Paul's sister [[Lucy Robinson (Neighbours)|Lucy Robinson]] ([[Melissa Bell (actor)|Melissa Bell]]).\n\nHarlow was discharged from the hospital, but still mourn over the loss of her mother. Harlow kept Prue's final voice message from her phone and kept listening to it. Harlow drops her phone, and Paul and Terese learn that Harlow's been listening to Prue's voice message. Paul tries to take her phone and with a struggle, Paul accidentally deletes the message, upsetting Harlow. [[Mark Brennan (Neighbours)|Mark Brennan]], was told by Hendrix of the incident and tells Harlow that the police has a copy of Prue's message and offers to give Harlow a copy of it, which is she accepts. Roxy hosts a memorial party for Prue, and Harlow was unable to join, but with some encouragement from Hendrix, Harlow joins the party. That night, Harlow walks Hendrix home, where she decided to sleep with him and they had sex. The next day, Harlow realised she regret about sleeping with Hendrix and told Terese and Roxy, but is unaware that Paul overheard it and confronts Hendrix on his own. Harlow is furious when Paul accuses Hendrix for taking advantage of her and threatening him to stay away. Harlow apologises to Hendrix for Paul's behaviour, but still clashes with Paul for being unfair with Hendrix and purposely rips and scribbles Paul's paperwork. Harlow gets involved with a police raid with Mackenzie when the police raided inside Mackenzie's apartment that she shares with Mannix Foster, who is a criminal. Harlow continues to clash with Paul and refuses to talk to him. After getting some advice from David, Harlow apologises to Paul and they made peace, but she quickly learns from David, who confronts Paul for making Aaron hide stolen goods, that Mannix stole.\n\n==Mackenzie Hargreaves==\n{{Infobox soap character\n| series = Neighbours\n| name = Mackenzie Hargreaves\n| portrayer = [[Georgie Stone]]\n| introducer = [[Jason Herbison]]\n| first = {{start date|2019|8|30|df=y}}\n| classification = [[List of Neighbours characters#Present characters|Current; regular]]\n| spinoffs= ''[[Neighbours: Erinsborough High]]'' (2019)\n| occupation = Student\n| home = [[Ramsay Street#No. 30|30 Ramsay Street]]\n| mother = Sarah Hargreaves\n| father = [[#Grant Hargreaves|Grant Hargreaves]]\n| aunts = [[List of Neighbours characters (2020)#Trish Symington|Trish Symington]]\n}}\n'''Mackenzie Hargreaves''', played by [[Georgie Stone]], made her first appearance on 30 August 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/neighbours/a28729021/neighbours-spoilers-elly-suffers-another-baby-scare|title=Neighbours spoiler: Elly suffers another baby scare|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"WW\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nowtolove.com.au/celebrity/tv/neighbours-mackenzie-georgie-stone-57103|title=Exclusive: Meet Georgie Stone, the amazing transgender activist about to star on Neighbours|date=22 July 2019|work=[[The Australian Women's Weekly]]|accessdate=22 July 2019}}</ref> She is the show's first transgender character,<ref name=\"Anderton\"/> and the second trans actress to portray a trans character on Australian television.<ref name=\"WW\"/> Stone's casting was announced on 23 March 2019.<ref name=\"Anderton\">{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/neighbours/a26915706/neighbours-first-transgender-character-georgie-stone-guest-role/|title=Neighbours to introduce its first transgender character as Georgie Stone joins the soap in guest role|last=Anderton|first=Joe|date=23 March 2019|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=18 June 2019}}</ref> She had approached the show about introducing a transgender character in 2018.

When Yashvi fails an English test, Mackenzie suggests that she asks to resit it and explain the reason why she failed. Yashvi is sure she knows Mackenzie from some where, but Mackenzie assures her that they have never met and she has never lived in Bourke, where Yashvi and her family are from. However, Mackenzie later hides a Bourke keyring in her pocket, which later falls out in the cafe owned by Yashvi's parents. Fellow student [[#Richie Amblin|Richie Amblin]] (Lachlan Miller) asks Mackenzie to the school dance, but she turns him down as she might be gone by the time it happens. Mackenzie later comes to Yashvi's father [[Shane Rebecchi]] (Nicholas Coghlan) and tells him that he used to know her mother, Sarah, and he was the reason she wanted to go to Erinsborough High. She asks him to find her father [[#Grant Hargreaves|Grant Hargreaves]] ([[Paul Mercurio]]), who she has not seen in years. When Yashvi suspects that Mackenzie is Shane's love child, he asks her to tell his family who she is. Mackenzie explains to Yashvi that she used to know her as Michael, and she tells the Rebecchi family that she has always known that she was a girl, but her father struggled to accept her, so she and her mother moved away. Now, she wants her father in her life. Yashvi apologises for jumping to conclusions.\n\nMackenzie panics when someone overhears Yashvi mention that she is trans, as she was bullied at her last school. Yashvi works out that it was Richie and accidentally outs Mackenzie while arguing with him. Mackenzie rejects Yashvi's apology, as she feels Yashvi does not know what she is apologising for. She also tells Principal [[Susan Kennedy]] ([[Jackie Woodburne]]) that she plans to stay at the school. Mackenzie later explains to Yashvi that not only did she out her, but she said that Mackenzie used to be a boy, which she finds offensive as she has always been a girl. She accepts Yashvi's apology, but asks for some time. Mackenzie and Yashvi reconcile after Yashvi tries to remove some transphobic graffiti from the girls' toilet door. Shortly after, Mackenzie finds a threatening note in her locker and Susan suggests Mackenzie use the disabled toilets, until the culprit has been found. Yashvi leads the students in a protest against the injustice, which Richie joins, much to the disdain of his friend [[#Ollie Sudekis|Ollie Sudekis]] (Ellmir Asipi). Susan realises that she has made a mistake and apologises to Mackenzie. Ollie makes transphobic comments to Mackenzie, resulting in Shane pushing him up against a wall. Mackenzie is grateful for Shane's support.\n\nAt [[Sheila Canning]]'s ([[Colette Mann]]) birthday party, Mackenzie meets and flirts with [[Hendrix Greyson]] (Benny Turland). She tells him that she is transgender, and he says it does not change anything, before they kiss. Shane gets a strong lead on Grant's whereabouts, and Mackenzie tells him about the day her father burnt all her feminine belongings. Shane later admits that he told Grant she was transgender. Shane's wife [[Dipi Rebecchi]] (Sharon Johal) finds Mackenzie at a butterfly house, and convinces her to come back to Erinsborough. Mackenzie tells her that she cannot forgive Shane and will not speak to him again. Hendrix manipulates Mackenzie into asking him to the school formal. Shane and Dipi inform Mackenzie that Grant is coming to Erinsborough. Mackenzie's first interaction with her father is awkward, as he calls her by her old name. Grant says that Mackenzie is and always will be male to him, causing her to walk out. Yashvi and Harlow comfort her, and when she meets with Grant again, he makes an effort by calling her Mackenzie. She invites him to the school dance, but he fails to turn up and leaves town. Mackenzie neglects Hendrix to spend time with Yashvi and Harlow, and she later sees him kissing [[#Olivia Lane|Olivia Lane]] (Grace O'Sullivan). Shane dances with Mackenzie during the father-daughter dance. She forgives him and assures him that Grant's views are not his responsibility. Mackenzie asserts that although she has not reconciled with her father, she still feels like she has found family in Erinsborough.\n\nIn the spin-off ''Erinsborough High'', Mackenzie and Richie admit their feelings for each other and begin dating, despite her concerns about Richie being more sexually experienced than she is. Before she can tell him that she has not had [[gender reassignment surgery]], Richie tells her that he knows as he did some research, and he still wants date her. The following year, Mackenzie helps Harlow with her unexpected feelings for Hendrix. She contemplates studying law after finishing school, and asks [[Toadie Rebecchi]] ([[Ryan Moloney]]) for advice. Mackenzie attends The Waterhole's Mardi Gras party and tells Hendrix to treat Harlow right, after learning they have feelings for each other. Mackenzie's aunt [[List of Neighbours characters (2020)#Trish Symington|Trish Symington]] (Katherine Tonkin) plans to move to Fremantle, but Mackenzie refuses to go and decides to ask the Rebecchis if she can stay with them, however, she realises that they are grieving for a friend and decides not to approach them. [[Roxy Willis]] (Zima Anderson) helps Mackenzie convince Trish that she is living at Number 22, while she secretly stays in Trish's apartment. As she struggles alone, Roxy suggests Mackenzie gets a housemate and [[Mannix Foster]] (Sam Webb) moves in. Mackenzie is suspicious of Mannix when he puts a lock on his bedroom door and wants to be informed if guests are coming over. While Harlow is visiting, the police raid the apartment and Mackenzie learns that Mannix is a criminal.

He hands her a tissue and decides to keep her company. Scarlett explains that her fianc\u00e9 Rex called off their wedding in the middle of the ceremony, and she has maxed out her credit card paying for a flight home. Ned buys them some drinks. Scarlett sees Ned's phone passcode as he enters it, and later deletes a text message about an available flight. Before Ned leaves for a hotel, they take a selfie together. A week later, Scarlett comes to Erinsborough and Ned notices her in the local cafe. She tells him that she is on a personal tour of the country and thought she would start with Erinsborough after he told her about it. Realising that Ned works at Lassiters Hotel, Scarlett mentions that she has plenty of hospitality experience. She later places a suitcase behind porter [[#Trevor Nugent|Trevor Nugent]] (Warwick Sadler), causing him to trip over. With Trevor hospitalised, Ned offers Scarlett a job covering his shifts. To thank him, Scarlett buys them lunch, which is interrupted by Ned's girlfriend [[Yashvi Rebecchi]] (Olivia Junkeer). After they leave, Scarlett looks at a scrapbook, which contains information about her failed wedding and deceased family, and admires the selfie she took of herself and Ned. When Scarlett mentions that she is lonely, Ned gives her a tour of the area and they book dinner for three at [[Erinsborough#The 82|The 82]]. Scarlett attempts to cause trouble between Ned and Yashvi by bringing up their age gap, before mentioning that she and Ned met at the airport, which upsets Yashvi as Ned did not tell her. \n\nScarlett tries to befriend Yashvi and moves into the spare room at Number 32 Ramsay Street. She spies on Ned while he showering and takes photos of him. After learning about how protective Ned can be around his former girlfriend [[Bea Nilsson]] ([[Bonnie Anderson (singer)|Bonnie Anderson]]), Scarlett sabotages Bea's microphone lead and calls Ned to The Waterhole on the pretext of a mix up with his shifts. Just as he goes to leave, Bea receives an electric shock. Ned helps break the connection and takes her to the hospital, making him late to meet Yashvi. Scarlett gives Yashvi an edited version of what happened to Bea and plays up Ned's involvement in helping her, which leads to them taking a break from their relationship. Scarlett uses the opportunity to get closer to Ned, and she learns that Bea has developed a heart arrhythmia from the electric shock. Scarlett soon declares that her former boyfriend Rex is stalking her, and Ned offers to stay over at Number 32 for the night.

He accidentally spills soda in his lap, causing him to lose control of the car and he crashes into a marquee at Lassiters, injuring Harlow. Pierce threatens to report him to the police, but when Harlow's grandfather [[Paul Robinson (Neighbours)|Paul Robinson]] ([[Stefan Dennis]]) confronts Hendrix, Pierce takes the blame, saying he asked Hendrix to park his car.

Prue asks after Harlow, and learns that she has not mentioned Prue much. Prue explains that she is in the wellness industry and tells Paul and Terese about the philosophies she lives her life by. Prue notices a man, Graham, watching her and cuts the meeting short. As she walks off, Graham asks how it went and Prue tells him that Paul and Terese seem kind and are looking after Harlow. He then tells her that it is time to let Harlow go because if she is not with them, she is against them. Prue sends Harlow a text asking her not to worry if she does not hear from her for a while. Just over a month later, Prue comes to Erinsborough and voices her disapproval about Harlow's living arrangement, as Paul and Terese's hotel has been caught up in a sex tape scandal.

Prue befriends [[Gary Canning]] ([[Damien Richardson (actor)|Damien Richardson]]) at The Waterhole and they go on several dates. Harlow worries that her mother has forgotten her, but Prue makes sure to prioritise her and they start to reconnect. \n\nPrue receives phone calls from the Restoration Order demanding payment, and she is tempted to steal from the till at The 82, but Gary catches her.

Gary asks to hear more about the Order and he later lends her the money she needs. Prue also attempts to convince Harlow that they could make a good life for themselves in London. When she catches Terese drinking wine, knowing that she is an alcoholic, Prue asks her to support her plan to take Harlow home to the UK and Terese agrees.

However, as they stop at a [[milk bar]], Harlow recalls Prue telling Terese to \"trust in the process\" and realises that she is still in the Order.

She begs her mother to stay in Erinsborough with her, but Prue leaves her outside the shop and flies back to London.\n\nThe following year, Prue returns to Erinsborough claiming that she has left the Restoration Order. She tries to repair her relationship with Harlow. During a barbecue at the Cannings, Prue and Gary announce that they are engaged, shocking Harlow and Gary's family. After attempting to rebuild her relationship with Harlow, it is revealed that Prue did not leave the Order \u2013 rather, she was forced out due to a lack of finances. Upon finding out, Gary calls off the wedding and decides to join his son on the glamping trip. Prue takes the box containing their honeymoon destination and follows him in her car.

They do not get a chance to talk to Robert, who leaves when his father Paul Robinson enters the room. Harlow tells David, Aaron and Paul that she is Robert's daughter, and that her mother met him while backpacking in Tasmania. They invite her to stay with them in Erinsborough. Paul introduces Harlow to his fianc\u00e9e, [[Terese Willis]] ([[Rebekah Elmaloglou]]), who she instantly bonds with, and invites her to live with them, after she says she wants to get to know Paul for herself. Paul initially struggles to talk to Harlow about Robert, but he eventually gives her a letter he wrote to his son that explains their relationship. Terese's niece [[Roxy Willis]] (Zima Anderson) takes an instant dislike to Harlow and the two girls struggle to get along. Harlow enrols at Erinsborough High and befriends [[Yashvi Rebecchi]] (Olivia Junkeer). After Paul is attacked, Roxy claims that [[Gary Canning]] ([[Damien Richardson (actor)|Damien Richardson]]) is responsible. Harlow notices that Gary's mother [[Sheila Canning]] ([[Colette Mann]]) is nervous and soon finds that she has hidden a bloodied crowbar in her recycling bin. Harlow hands it into the police, who arrest Sheila. Roxy soon confesses that her former boyfriend attacked Paul. Harlow later calls out Roxy's immature behaviour when she realises Roxy has not apologised to Gary.\n\nTerese gives Harlow and Roxy the use of her daughter's car, Hermione, causing them to clash again when Roxy gives it a make-over. After Roxy tries on Terese's wedding dress and rips it, Harlow tells Terese what happened, but is surprised when Terese accepts that it was just an accident. When Roxy confronts her for telling Terese, Harlow throws food at her and they fight. They are interrupted by the arrival of Harlow's grandmother, [[Gail Robinson (Neighbours)|Gail Lewis]] ([[Fiona Corke]]). Gail plans to take Harlow to Tasmania with her, after seeing how bad the relationship between her and Roxy is. She changes her mind when she learns that Harlow is doing well in school and wants to stay in Erinsborough. Harlow discovers Roxy has a casual relationship with [[Mark Brennan (Neighbours)|Mark Brennan]] ([[Scott McGregor (model)|Scott McGregor]]) and blackmails Roxy into doing her chores and giving her custody of the car. She also learns that Gail was involved in a conspiracy against Paul and encourages Gail to go and be with her daughter New York. She later tells [[Ned Willis]] (Ben Hall) that she thought Gail came to Erinsborough to get to know her. Ned encourages her to say goodbye to Gail properly. While Terese and Paul are honeymooning in London, they decide to meet Harlow's mother, [[#Prue Wallace|Prue Wallace]] ([[Denise van Outen]]). Harlow tries to put them off and tells [[Amy Williams (Neighbours)|Amy Williams]] ([[Zoe Cramond]]) that Prue is in a cult. After Mark publicly humiliates Roxy, Harlow and Sheila encourage her to end the relationship, which she does.\n\nHarlow repeatedly clashes with [[Hendrix Greyson]] (Benny Turland), who attempts to sabotage her presentation at school. During the school dance, Harlow confronts Hendrix for kissing [[Olivia Lane]] (Grace O'Sullivan) in front of his date [[Mackenzie Hargreaves]] ([[Georgie Stone]]). Olivia accuses Harlow for being jealous, and Hendrix kisses her. She then slaps him. During a Melbourne Cup event at Lassiters, Harlow is injured when Hendrix crashes into a marquee, trapping her inside. Roxy frees her and Harlow thanks her for caring. She refuses to accept Hendrix's half-hearted apology. Days later, Harlow and Roxy find the Melbourne Cup trophy in the boot of their car. After taking some photos with it, they bring it back to Terese, who initially accuses Roxy of taking it, however, Harlow believes it was Hendrix and CCTV confirms he was responsible.\n\nWhen David gets involved in a hit-and-run accident, and needs a kidney transplant, Harlow couldn't be tested, as she's a minor. As non of the David's family members are a possible match for David, Harlow decide to turns to Robert, but Paul disagrees on her idea, but she went to him anyway, with Roxy. When Paul finds out, he is furious at Harlow for disobeying him, but agrees as David is running out of time. Robert goes to the hospital with the police, but later escapes. He calls Harlow to meet him, and she agrees to go. Harlow persuade him to save David, and he returns to the hospital with Harlow and the police. The surgery became a success and Robert returns to prison and David is recovering. Harlow decides to get private tutoring lessons and ask former school teacher [[Finn Kelly]]) [[Rob Mills]]) to tutor her. Harlow develop a crush on Hendrix and tells Mackenzie about her crush on Hendrix, [[Karl Kennedy]], overheard her and mistook her having a crush on Finn and told Finn's girlfriend, [[Bea Nilsson]] ([[Bonnie Anderson (singer)|Bonnie Anderson]]). Harlow heard what happened and informs Bea that she doesn't have a crush on Finn, and Bea believes her.\n\nHarlow became suspicious of Hendrix, when he shows up to her home, shirtless and tries to seduce him in a classroom, but he pulls away and Harlow admits to him that she doesn't like him that way. However, her feelings for Hendrix continues. While practicing her driving lessons with Terese, Harlow accidentally hit and killed Terese's daughter [[Piper Willis]]' (Mavournee Hazel) cat, Clementine, while reversing the car through the driveway. Hendrix, who has a close bond with Clementine, blames Harlow for her death. Harlow decide to hold a funeral for Clementine and invites Hendrix to say goodbye. After burying Clementine, Hendrix apologises to Harlow for being harsh and Harlow gives Hendrix one of Clementine's toys. They almost kiss, but Harlow sneezes at Hendrix's face. Harlow attends to the Waterhole Mardi Gras party with Mackenzie and overheard Paul and Gary arguing about Prue returning to Erinsborough and is mad at Gary for not telling her. Hendrix comforts Harlow and they share a kiss. Harlow began to avoid Hendrix's texts, as she is stressed about her mother's return to Erinsborough, but later told Hendrix the reason why she didn't answer his messages.\n\nWhen Prue arrives, Harlow struggles to trust her, but she attends a welcome barbecue with Paul and Terese. There, Gary and Pure announce they are engaged. Harlow and Gary's son, [[Kyle Canning]] ([[Chris Milligan]]) are opposed to the engagement and the wedding, which is happening at the Lassiter's Wedding Expo. Harlow and Hendrix talk about their kiss and she gently rejects him, preferring them to stay frenemies, which he accepts. Hendrix later tells her that he wants to earn her trust and asks her out on a date, which is a success. Prue convinces Harlow to be there at her wedding, but while planning Prue's hen's party, Harlow discovers a notification of an email from the Order on her mother's laptop. She realises that her mother lied to her and Gary about leaving the Order and she confronts Prue, before being comforted by Hendrix.\n\nHarlow and Hendrix decide to travel to [[Pierce Greyson]]'s ([[Tim Robards]]) island, where some of their friends and neighbours have gathered for [[Elly Conway]]'s ([[Jodi Anasta]]) birthday. They tell Paul and Terese that they are staying with friends, and set up camp away from the others. Harlow sends Gary a text message about Prue's lies. Harlow feels pressured to have sex by Hendrix and they argue. She leaves and comes across Bea, who is trapped in a mineshaft with a broken leg. Harlow jumps down to help, but she also becomes trapped. Finn returns to check if Bea is still alive and throw rocks down. He then throws a snake down, which bites Harlow when she and Bea try to catch it in a rucksack. Gary tries to save them, but is killed by Finn, who also pushes Elly into the mineshaft. The others eventually find them, and they jump down to avoid a fire that engulfs the island. After being rescued, Harlow is taken to Erinsborough Hospital and placed in an induced coma. Paul blames Hendrix for Harlow's condition and initially bans him from seeing her. After waking up from her coma, Harlow listens to a voicemail on her phone, that was left by Prue and hears an explosion. She asks Paul where her mother is, and he tells her that she died. They later learn that she was killed by a bomb that Finn had left for Paul's sister [[Lucy Robinson (Neighbours)|Lucy Robinson]] ([[Melissa Bell (actor)|Melissa Bell]]).\n\nHarlow was discharged from the hospital, but still mourn over the loss of her mother. Harlow kept Prue's final voice message from her phone and kept listening to it. Harlow drops her phone, and Paul and Terese learn that Harlow's been listening to Prue's voice message. Paul tries to take her phone and with a struggle, Paul accidentally deletes the message, upsetting Harlow. [[Mark Brennan (Neighbours)|Mark Brennan]], was told by Hendrix of the incident and tells Harlow that the police has a copy of Prue's message and offers to give Harlow a copy of it, which is she accepts. Roxy hosts a memorial party for Prue, and Harlow was unable to join, but with some encouragement from Hendrix, Harlow joins the party. That night, Harlow walks Hendrix home, where she decided to sleep with him and they had sex. The next day, Harlow realised she regret about sleeping with Hendrix and told Terese and Roxy, but is unaware that Paul overheard it and confronts Hendrix on his own. Harlow is furious when Paul accuses Hendrix for taking advantage of her and threatening him to stay away. Harlow apologises to Hendrix for Paul's behaviour, but still clashes with Paul for being unfair with Hendrix and purposely rips and scribbles Paul's paperwork. Harlow gets involved with a police raid with Mackenzie when the police raided inside Mackenzie's apartment that she shares with Mannix Foster, who is a criminal. Harlow continues to clash with Paul and refuses to talk to him. After getting some advice from David, Harlow apologises to Paul and they made peace, but she quickly learns from David, who confronts Paul for making Aaron hide stolen goods, that Mannix stole.\n\n==Mackenzie Hargreaves==\n{{Infobox soap character\n| series = Neighbours\n| name = Mackenzie Hargreaves\n| portrayer = [[Georgie Stone]]\n| introducer = [[Jason Herbison]]\n| first = {{start date|2019|8|30|df=y}}\n| classification = [[List of Neighbours characters#Present characters|Current; regular]]\n| spinoffs= ''[[Neighbours: Erinsborough High]]'' (2019)\n| occupation = Student\n| home = [[Ramsay Street#No. 30|30 Ramsay Street]]\n| mother = Sarah Hargreaves\n| father = [[#Grant Hargreaves|Grant Hargreaves]]\n| aunts = [[List of Neighbours characters (2020)#Trish Symington|Trish Symington]]\n}}\n'''Mackenzie Hargreaves''', played by [[Georgie Stone]], made her first appearance on 30 August 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/neighbours/a28729021/neighbours-spoilers-elly-suffers-another-baby-scare|title=Neighbours spoiler: Elly suffers another baby scare|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"WW\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nowtolove.com.au/celebrity/tv/neighbours-mackenzie-georgie-stone-57103|title=Exclusive: Meet Georgie Stone, the amazing transgender activist about to star on Neighbours|date=22 July 2019|work=[[The Australian Women's Weekly]]|accessdate=22 July 2019}}</ref> She is the show's first transgender character,<ref name=\"Anderton\"/> and the second trans actress to portray a trans character on Australian television.<ref name=\"WW\"/> Stone's casting was announced on 23 March 2019.<ref name=\"Anderton\">{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/neighbours/a26915706/neighbours-first-transgender-character-georgie-stone-guest-role/|title=Neighbours to introduce its first transgender character as Georgie Stone joins the soap in guest role|last=Anderton|first=Joe|date=23 March 2019|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=18 June 2019}}</ref> She had approached the show about introducing a transgender character in 2018.

When Yashvi fails an English test, Mackenzie suggests that she asks to resit it and explain the reason why she failed. Yashvi is sure she knows Mackenzie from some where, but Mackenzie assures her that they have never met and she has never lived in Bourke, where Yashvi and her family are from. However, Mackenzie later hides a Bourke keyring in her pocket, which later falls out in the cafe owned by Yashvi's parents. Fellow student [[#Richie Amblin|Richie Amblin]] (Lachlan Miller) asks Mackenzie to the school dance, but she turns him down as she might be gone by the time it happens. Mackenzie later comes to Yashvi's father [[Shane Rebecchi]] (Nicholas Coghlan) and tells him that he used to know her mother, Sarah, and he was the reason she wanted to go to Erinsborough High. She asks him to find her father [[#Grant Hargreaves|Grant Hargreaves]] ([[Paul Mercurio]]), who she has not seen in years. When Yashvi suspects that Mackenzie is Shane's love child, he asks her to tell his family who she is. Mackenzie explains to Yashvi that she used to know her as Michael, and she tells the Rebecchi family that she has always known that she was a girl, but her father struggled to accept her, so she and her mother moved away. Now, she wants her father in her life. Yashvi apologises for jumping to conclusions.\n\nMackenzie panics when someone overhears Yashvi mention that she is trans, as she was bullied at her last school. Yashvi works out that it was Richie and accidentally outs Mackenzie while arguing with him. Mackenzie rejects Yashvi's apology, as she feels Yashvi does not know what she is apologising for. She also tells Principal [[Susan Kennedy]] ([[Jackie Woodburne]]) that she plans to stay at the school. Mackenzie later explains to Yashvi that not only did she out her, but she said that Mackenzie used to be a boy, which she finds offensive as she has always been a girl. She accepts Yashvi's apology, but asks for some time. Mackenzie and Yashvi reconcile after Yashvi tries to remove some transphobic graffiti from the girls' toilet door. Shortly after, Mackenzie finds a threatening note in her locker and Susan suggests Mackenzie use the disabled toilets, until the culprit has been found. Yashvi leads the students in a protest against the injustice, which Richie joins, much to the disdain of his friend [[#Ollie Sudekis|Ollie Sudekis]] (Ellmir Asipi). Susan realises that she has made a mistake and apologises to Mackenzie. Ollie makes transphobic comments to Mackenzie, resulting in Shane pushing him up against a wall. Mackenzie is grateful for Shane's support.\n\nAt [[Sheila Canning]]'s ([[Colette Mann]]) birthday party, Mackenzie meets and flirts with [[Hendrix Greyson]] (Benny Turland). She tells him that she is transgender, and he says it does not change anything, before they kiss. Shane gets a strong lead on Grant's whereabouts, and Mackenzie tells him about the day her father burnt all her feminine belongings. Shane later admits that he told Grant she was transgender. Shane's wife [[Dipi Rebecchi]] (Sharon Johal) finds Mackenzie at a butterfly house, and convinces her to come back to Erinsborough. Mackenzie tells her that she cannot forgive Shane and will not speak to him again. Hendrix manipulates Mackenzie into asking him to the school formal. Shane and Dipi inform Mackenzie that Grant is coming to Erinsborough. Mackenzie's first interaction with her father is awkward, as he calls her by her old name. Grant says that Mackenzie is and always will be male to him, causing her to walk out. Yashvi and Harlow comfort her, and when she meets with Grant again, he makes an effort by calling her Mackenzie. She invites him to the school dance, but he fails to turn up and leaves town. Mackenzie neglects Hendrix to spend time with Yashvi and Harlow, and she later sees him kissing [[#Olivia Lane|Olivia Lane]] (Grace O'Sullivan). Shane dances with Mackenzie during the father-daughter dance. She forgives him and assures him that Grant's views are not his responsibility. Mackenzie asserts that although she has not reconciled with her father, she still feels like she has found family in Erinsborough.\n\nIn the spin-off ''Erinsborough High'', Mackenzie and Richie admit their feelings for each other and begin dating, despite her concerns about Richie being more sexually experienced than she is. Before she can tell him that she has not had [[gender reassignment surgery]], Richie tells her that he knows as he did some research, and he still wants date her. The following year, Mackenzie helps Harlow with her unexpected feelings for Hendrix. She contemplates studying law after finishing school, and asks [[Toadie Rebecchi]] ([[Ryan Moloney]]) for advice. Mackenzie attends The Waterhole's Mardi Gras party and tells Hendrix to treat Harlow right, after learning they have feelings for each other. Mackenzie's aunt [[List of Neighbours characters (2020)#Trish Symington|Trish Symington]] (Katherine Tonkin) plans to move to Fremantle, but Mackenzie refuses to go and decides to ask the Rebecchis if she can stay with them, however, she realises that they are grieving for a friend and decides not to approach them. [[Roxy Willis]] (Zima Anderson) helps Mackenzie convince Trish that she is living at Number 22, while she secretly stays in Trish's apartment. As she struggles alone, Roxy suggests Mackenzie gets a housemate and [[Mannix Foster]] (Sam Webb) moves in. Mackenzie is suspicious of Mannix when he puts a lock on his bedroom door and wants to be informed if guests are coming over. While Harlow is visiting, the police raid the apartment and Mackenzie learns that Mannix is a criminal. Shane and Dipi invite Mackenzie to stay with them and she accepts.\n\n==Scarlett Brady==\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series = Neighbours\n|name = Scarlett Brady\n|portrayer = [[Christie Whelan Browne]]\n|introducer = [[Jason Herbison]]\n|first = {{start date|2019|9|9|df=y}}\n|last = {{end date|2019|10|31|df=y}}\n|classification = [[Recurring characters of Neighbours#B|Former; recurring]]\n|occupation = Porter\n}}\n'''Scarlett Brady''', played by [[Christie Whelan Browne]], made her first appearance on 9 September 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/neighbours/a28882381/neighbours-spoilers-ned-willis-scarlett-brady-meet/|title=Neighbours hints at trouble for Ned Willis as newcomer Scarlett arrives|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=1 September 2019|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=1 September 2019}}</ref> Whelan Browne's casting and her character details were announced on 17 June 2019.<ref name=\"Haddrick\">{{cite web|url=https://www.newidea.com.au/australian-actress-christie-whelan-browne-to-join-neighbours-cast|title=Christie Whelan Browne announces she is joining this popular Aussie soap|last=Haddrick|first=Milly|date=17 June 2019|work=[[New Idea]]|accessdate=17 June 2019}}</ref> She admitted that was lucky to get the role and was unsure as to how it happened.

Scarlett sees Ned's phone passcode as he enters it, and later deletes a text message about an available flight. Before Ned leaves for a hotel, they take a selfie together. A week later, Scarlett comes to Erinsborough and Ned notices her in the local cafe. She tells him that she is on a personal tour of the country and thought she would start with Erinsborough after he told her about it. Realising that Ned works at Lassiters Hotel, Scarlett mentions that she has plenty of hospitality experience. She later places a suitcase behind porter [[#Trevor Nugent|Trevor Nugent]] (Warwick Sadler), causing him to trip over. With Trevor hospitalised, Ned offers Scarlett a job covering his shifts.

Just as he goes to leave, Bea receives an electric shock. Ned helps break the connection and takes her to the hospital, making him late to meet Yashvi. Scarlett gives Yashvi an edited version of what happened to Bea and plays up Ned's involvement in helping her, which leads to them taking a break from their relationship. Scarlett uses the opportunity to get closer to Ned, and she learns that Bea has developed a heart arrhythmia from the electric shock. Scarlett soon declares that her former boyfriend Rex is stalking her, and Ned offers to stay over at Number 32 for the night. When she learns Yashvi is coming over, Scarlett lays down next to a sleeping Ned on the couch, so Yashvi catches them together. Yashvi then breaks up with Ned. Scarlett claims Rex has threatened her, and she later pays someone to throw a brick through the kitchen window, so Ned will stay with her. Scarlett initiates a kiss between them and they have sex, but Scarlett notices that Ned regrets it. She then tells Yashvi what happened and pretends to be attracted to [[Kyle Canning]] ([[Chris Milligan]]) to make Ned jealous. \n\n[[Paul Robinson (Neighbours)|Paul Robinson]] ([[Stefan Dennis]]) learns that Scarlett has lied about working in hotels and attempts to fire her, but she reveals that she found a hidden camera in one of the rooms and will go to the press if he does. Scarlett pretends that she has lost her phone at The 82 and while she and Ned are looking for it, he is struck by a speeding motorbike and suffers a dislocated shoulder. Scarlett insists that Ned moves into Number 32 and she soon seduces him. Yashvi confronts Scarlett about her former boyfriend [[#Scott Mayfair|Scott Mayfair]] (Tom Jackson), who says that she tried to kill him, but Scarlett insists that Scott is lying. She then convinces Ned to leave town for a country B&B. To celebrate Halloween, Ned and Scarlett dress up, but Ned is thrown when Scarlett wears a wedding dress and starts talking about their future. Scarlett tells Ned they are meant to be together, but when he tries to leave, she stabs him with a cheese knife. She then chases Ned through the maze, as Bea and Yashvi enter to rescue Ned. Scarlett slashes Yashvi's leg, while Bea helps Ned to escape. He collapses by a tree, where Scarlett finds him and attempts to kill him. Yashvi tackles her to the ground and Scarlett is arrested. At the police station, Paul turns up to goad Scarlett, who replies with \"trick or treat\". Paul later learns that the footage from the hidden camera has been given to the press.\n\n==Hendrix Greyson==\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series = Neighbours\n|name = Hendrix Greyson\n|portrayer = Benny Turland\n|introducer = [[Jason Herbison]]\n|first = {{start date|2019|9|13|df=y}}\n|classification = [[List of Neighbours characters#Present characters|Current; regular]]\n|spinoffs = ''[[Neighbours: Erinsborough High]]'' (2019)\n|occupation = Student \n|home = [[Ramsay Street#No. 24|24 Ramsay Street]]\n|father = [[Pierce Greyson]]\n|mother = [[Lisa Rowsthorn]]\n|stepmother = [[Chloe Brennan (Neighbours)|Chloe Brennan]]\n|sisters = Alana Greyson\n}}\n'''Hendrix Greyson''', played by Benny Turland, made his first appearance on 13 September 2019.<ref name=\"Son\">{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/neighbours/a28882514/neighbours-spoilers-pierce-greyson-son-hendrix/|title=Neighbours bringing in Pierce Greyson's son as new regular character|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=1 September 2019|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=1 September 2019}}</ref> The character and Turland's casting was announced on 1 September.
