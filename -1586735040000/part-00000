During the making of the track, four additional studios (Roundhouse, [[Sarm East Studios]], [[Scorpio Sound]], and [[Wessex Sound Studios]]) were used.{{Sfn|Cunningham|1995}} According to some band members, Mercury mentally prepared the song beforehand and directed the band throughout.{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}} Mercury used a [[C.

May stated that he wanted to compose \"a little tune that would be a counterpart to the main melody; I didn't just want to play the melody\". The guitarist said that his better material stems from this way of working: in which he thought of the tune before playing it: \"the fingers tend to be predictable unless being led by the brain.\"{{Sfn | BBC| 2004b}} According to Baker, \"the end of the song was much heavier because it was one of the first mixes to be done with [[mix automation|automation]]...

The narrator introduces himself as \"just a poor boy\" but declares that he \"needs no sympathy\" because he is \"easy come, easy go\" and then \"little high, little low\" (when heard in [[Stereophonic sound|stereo]], the words \"little high\" come from the left speaker whereas the \"little low\" comes from the right); [[Diatonic and chromatic|chromatic]] [[Outside (jazz)|side-slipping]] on \"easy come, easy go\" highlights the dream-like atmosphere.

After it plays twice, Mercury's vocals enter. Over the course of the section, the vocals evolve from a softly sung harmony to an impassioned solo performance by Mercury. The narrator explains to his mother that he has \"just killed a man,\" with \"a gun against his head\" and in doing so, has thrown his life away. This \"confessional\" section, Whiteley comments, is \"affirmative of the nurturant and life-giving force of the feminine and the need for absolution\".{{Sfn|Whiteley|2006|p=252}} In the middle of the verse (1:19), Taylor's drums enter, and a descending chromatic run leads to a temporary modulation to E{{Music|flat}} major (up one fourth). The narrator makes the second of several invocations to his \"mama\" in the new key, continuing the original theme. The narrator explains his regret over \"mak[ing] you cry\" and urging \"mama\" to \"carry on as if nothing really matters\". A brief, descending variation of the piano phrase connects to the second verse.\n\nThen the piano intro plays, marking the start of the second verse. As the ballad proceeds into its second verse, the speaker confesses how ashamed he is by his act of murder (as May enters on guitar and mimics the upper range of the piano at 1:50). May imitates a [[bell tree]] during the line \"sends shivers down my spine\", by playing the strings of his guitar on the other side of the bridge. The narrator bids the world goodbye announcing he has \"got to go\" and prepares to \"face the truth\" admitting \"I don't want to die / I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.\" This is where the guitar solo enters.\n\n===Guitar solo (2:37\u20133:05)===\nTowards the end of the ballad section, the band builds in intensity, incorporating a guitar solo (in E{{Music|flat}} major) played and originally composed by Mercury, later improvised by May.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-34651067|title=Brian May on 40 years of Bohemian Rhapsody: 'I still listen to it in the car'|last=May|first=Brian|date=29 October 2015|website=BBC|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The intensity continues to build, but once the bass line completes its descent establishing modulation to the new key (A major), the entire band cuts out abruptly at 3:03 except for quiet, staccato [[A major]] quaver (eighth-note) chords on the piano, marking the start of the \"Opera\" section.\n\n===Opera (3:05\u20134:07)===\n{{Listen\n|filename = QueenBohemianRhapsody_Opera.ogg\n|title = \"Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the fandango?\"\n|description = The operatic segment enters immediately as May's solo abruptly concludes. This vast shift in style is just one example of how the song rapidly changes throughout its running time.\n}}\nA rapid series of rhythmic and harmonic changes introduces a pseudo-operatic midsection, which contains the bulk of the elaborate vocal multi-tracking, depicting the narrator's descent into hell. While the underlying pulse of the song is maintained, the dynamics vary greatly from bar to bar, from only Mercury's voice accompanied by a piano to a multi-voice choir supported by drums, bass, piano, and [[timpani]]. The choir effect was created by having May, Mercury, and Taylor repeatedly sing their vocal parts, resulting in 180 separate overdubs. These overdubs were then combined into successive submixes. According to Roger Taylor, the voices of May, Mercury and himself combined created a wide vocal range: \"Brian could get down quite low, Freddie had a powerful voice through the middle, and I was good at the high stuff.\" The band wanted to create \"a [[Wall of Sound|wall of sound]], that starts down and goes all the way up\".{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}} The band used the [[bell effect]] for lyrics \"Magnifico\" and \"Let me go\". Also, on \"Let him go\", Taylor singing the top section carries his note on further after the rest of the \"choir\" have stopped singing.\n\nLyrical references in this passage include [[Scaramouche]], the [[fandango]], [[Galileo Galilei]], [[The Barber of Seville (play)|Figaro]], [[Beelzebub]] and [[Basmala|Bismillah]], as rival factions fight over the narrator's soul, some wishing to \"let [him] go\" and \"spare him his life from this monstrosity\", while others sending him \"thunderbolts and lightning,/very, very fright'ning [him]\". According to ''Freddie Mercury: The Definitive Biography'' by [[Lesley-Ann Jones]]' theory: It is also figurative representation of the four members, Mercury, May, Taylor and Deacon respectively. The section concludes with a full choral treatment of the lyric \"[[Beelzebub]] has a [[devil]] put aside for me!\", on a block [[B-flat major|B{{Music|flat}} major]] chord. Roger Taylor tops the final chord with a [[falsetto]] B{{Music|flat}} in the [[scientific pitch notation|fifth octave]] (B{{Music|flat}}5).\n\nUsing the 24-track technology available at the time, the \"opera\" section took about three weeks to finish.{{Sfn|Chiu|2005}} Producer Roy Thomas Baker said \"Every time Freddie came up with another 'Galileo', I would add another piece of tape to the reel.\"{{Sfn|Cunningham|1995}} Baker recalls that they kept wearing out the tape, which meant having to do transfers.{{Sfn|Chiu|2005}}\n\n=== Hard rock (4:07\u20134:54)===\nThe operatic section leads into a rock interlude with a [[riff|guitar riff]] written by Mercury. At 4:15, a [[double tracking|quadruple-tracked]] Mercury (in stereo, the four parts are panned two on the left and two on the right) sings angry lyrics addressed to an unspecified \"you\", accusing them of betrayal and abuse and insisting \"can't do this to me, baby\", before the final lines conclude that the singer \"just gotta get right outta\" an unspecified \"here\". Three ascending guitar runs follow. Mercury then plays a similar B{{Music|flat}} run on the piano, as the song builds up to the finale with a [[Andantino (music)|''ritardando'']].\n\n===Outro (4:54\u20135:55)===\nAfter Mercury plays ascending octaves of notes from the B{{Music|flat}} [[Key of D Mixolydian mode (scale)|mixolydian]] mode (composed of the notes from the E{{Music|flat}} scale), the song then returns to the tempo and form of the introduction, initially in E{{Music|flat}} major, before quickly modulating to [[C minor]], only to soon go through an abrupt short series of modulations, bringing it back to [[C minor]] again in time for the final \"nothing really matters\" section. A guitar accompanies the chorus \"ooh, ooh yeah, ooh yeah.\" A double-tracked twin guitar melody is played through an amplifier designed by John Deacon, affectionately nicknamed the \"[[Deacy Amp]]\". Mercury's line \"Nothing really matters{{nbsp}}...\" appears again, \"cradled by light piano arpeggios suggesting both resignation (minor tonalities) and a new sense of freedom in the wide vocal span\".{{Sfn|Whiteley|2006|p=253}} After the line \"nothing really matters\" is repeated multiple times, the song finally concludes in the key of E{{Music|flat}} major, but then changes again to F major just before it ends. The final line, \"Any way the wind blows\", is followed by the quiet sound of a large [[tam-tam]] that finally expels the tension built up throughout the song.\n\n==Lyrics==\n''[[The New York Times]]'' commented that \"the song's most distinct feature is the fatalistic lyrics\". Mercury refused to explain his composition other than to say it was about relationships; the band is still protective of the song's secret.{{Sfn|Chiu|2005}} Brian May supports suggestions that the song contained veiled references to Mercury's personal traumas. He recalls \"Freddie was a very complex person: flippant and funny on the surface, but he concealed insecurities and problems in squaring up his life with his childhood. He never explained the lyrics, but I think he put a lot of himself into that song.\"{{Sfn|Black|2002}} May, though, says the band had agreed that the core of a lyric was a private issue for the composer.{{Sfn|Chiu|2005}} In a [[BBC Three]] documentary about the making of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", Roger Taylor maintains that the true meaning of the song is \"fairly self-explanatory with just a bit of nonsense in the middle\".{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}}\n\n{{quote box\n| salign = left\n| quote = It's one of those songs which has such a fantasy feel about it.

In the explanation, Queen states that \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" is about a young man who has accidentally killed someone and, like [[Faust]], sold his soul to the devil. On the night before his execution, he calls for God saying, \"[[Basmala|Bismillah]]\" (\"In the name of God\" in Arabic), and with the help of angels, regains his soul from [[Devil (Islam)|Shaitan]] (the devil in Islam).{{Sfn|BBC|2004a}}\n\nDespite this, critics, both journalistic and academic, have speculated over the meaning behind the song's lyrics. Some believe the lyrics describe a suicidal murderer haunted by demons or depict events just preceding an execution. The latter explanation points to [[Albert Camus]]'s novel ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'', in which a young man confesses to an impulsive murder and has an epiphany before he is executed, as probable inspiration. Others believe the lyrics were only written to fit with the music, and have no meaning; the DJ, television entertainer and comedian [[Kenny Everett]], who played an influential role in popularising the single on his radio show on [[Capital London|Capital Radio]], quoted Mercury as claiming the lyrics were simply \"random rhyming nonsense\".{{Sfn|Black|2002}}\n\nStill, others interpreted them as Mercury's way of dealing with personal issues.{{Sfn|Chiu|2005}} Music scholar Sheila Whiteley observes that Mercury reached a turning point in his personal life in the year he wrote \"Bohemian Rhapsody\".{{Sfn|Whiteley|2006|p=252}} He had been living with Mary Austin for seven years but had just embarked on his first love affair with a man. She suggests that the song provides an insight into Mercury's emotional state at the time, \"living with Mary ('Mamma', as in [[Mother Mary]]) and wanting to break away ('Mamma Mia let me go')\".{{Sfn|Whiteley|2006|p=253}} Others suggest it as veiled reference to [[coming out]], and dealing with the grave repercussions of the [[sodomy law]]s of the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/is-queens-bohemian-rhapsody-actually-about-coming-out-guy-branum-book-excerpt/|title=Is Queen's \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" Actually About Coming Out? - Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com|accessdate=7 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n[[File:Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen US vinyl red label.png|thumb|One of Side-A labels of the US single release]]\nWhen the band wanted to release the single in 1975, various executives suggested to them that, at 5 minutes and 55 seconds, it was too long and would never be a hit.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bohemian rhapsody celebrates 40 YEARS: 19 things you didn't know about the queen anthem |url=http://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/music/615750/Bohemian-Rhapsody-facts-Queen-40-years-anniversary |work=Express Online |date=30 October 2015 |access-date=28 September 2016}}</ref> The song was played to other musicians who commented the band had no hope of it ever being played on radio.{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}} According to producer Roy Thomas Baker, he and the band bypassed this corporate decision by playing the song for [[Capital Radio]] DJ [[Kenny Everett]]: \"we had a reel-to-reel copy but we told him he could only have it if he promised not to play it. 'I won't play it,' he said, winking ...\"{{Sfn|Cunningham|1995}} Their plan worked\u2014Everett teased his listeners by playing only parts of the song. Audience demand intensified when Everett played the full song on his show 14 times in two days.{{Sfn|Chiu|2005}} Hordes of fans attempted to buy the single the following Monday, only to be told by record stores that it had not yet been released.{{Sfn|Cunningham|1995}} The same weekend, Paul Drew, who ran the [[RKO General]] stations in the States, heard the track on Everett's show in London. Drew managed to get a copy of the tape and started to play it in the States, which forced the hand of Queen's US label, [[Elektra Records|Elektra]]. In an interview with ''[[Sound on Sound]]'', Baker reflects that \"it was a strange situation where radio on both sides of the Atlantic was breaking a record that the record companies said would never get airplay!\"{{Sfn|Cunningham|1995}} Eventually the unedited single was released, with \"I'm in Love with My Car\" as the [[B-side]]. Following Everett's escapade in October 1975, [[Eric Hall]], a record plugger, gave a copy to [[David Hamilton (broadcaster)|David \"Diddy\" Hamilton]] to play on his weekday Radio One show.

The second was upon its re-release (as a double A-side single with \"[[These Are the Days of Our Lives]]\") in 1991 following Mercury's death, staying at number one for five weeks.\n\nIn the United States, the single was also a success, although to a lesser extent than in the UK. The single, released in December 1975, reached number nine on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] for sales of one million copies.<ref name=\"RIAA\" /> In a retrospective article, [[Anthony DeCurtis]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' explained why the song performed less strongly in the US charts by saying that it is \"the quintessential example of the kind of thing that doesn't exactly go over well in America\".{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}} Its chart run of 24 weeks, however, placed it at number 18 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s year-end chart, higher than some number ones of the year.<ref name=\"BillboardYE1976\" /> With the Canadian record-buying public, the single fared better, reaching number one in the ''RPM'' national singles chart for the week ending 1 May 1976.<ref name=\"RPMTop100\"/>\n\n\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was re-released as a double A-side cassette single with \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\" in January 1992 following the death of Freddie Mercury, with proceeds going to the [[Magic Johnson Foundation]] for AIDS research.

A promo video also allowed the artist to have their music broadcast and accompanied by their own choice of visuals, rather than dancers such as [[Pan's People]]. According to May, the video was produced so that the band could avoid miming on ''Top of the Pops'', since they would have looked off miming to such a complex song.{{Sfn|Black|2002}} He also said that the band knew they would be set to appear at [[Dundee]]'s [[Caird Hall]] on tour and unable to appear on the programme anyway.{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}} The video has been hailed as launching the MTV age.{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}}\n\nThe band used Trillion, a subsidiary of [[Trident Studios]], their former management company and recording studio. They hired one of their trucks and got it to [[Elstree Studios]], where the band were rehearsing for their tour. The video was directed by [[Bruce Gowers]], who had directed a video of the band's 1974 performance at the [[Rainbow Theatre]] in London, and was recorded by cameraman Barry Dodd and [[assistant director]]/[[floor manager]] Jim McCutcheon. The video was recorded in just four hours on 10 November 1975, at a cost of \u00a34,500.{{Sfn|Hodkinson|2004|p=192}} Gowers reported that the band was involved in the discussion of the video and the end result, and \"was a co-operative to that extent, but there was only one leader.\"{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}}\n\nThe video opens with a shot of the four band members in near darkness as they sing the ''a cappella'' part. The lights fade up, and the shots cross-fade into close-ups of Freddie. The composition of the shot is the same as [[Mick Rock]]'s cover photograph for their second album ''[[Queen II]]''. The photo, inspired by a photograph of actress [[Marlene Dietrich]], was the band's favourite image of themselves.{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}} The video then fades into them playing their instruments. In the opera section of the video, the scene reverts to the ''Queen II'' standing positions, after which they perform once again on stage during the hard rock segment. In the closing seconds of the video Roger Taylor is depicted stripped to the waist, striking the [[Gong|tam tam]] in the manner of the trademark of the [[Rank Organisation]]'s [[Gongman]], familiar in the UK as the opening of all Rank film productions.\n\nAll of the special effects were achieved during the recording, rather than editing. The visual effect of Mercury's face cascading away (during the echoed line \"Magnifico\") was accomplished by pointing the camera at a monitor, giving [[optical feedback|visual feedback]], a glare analogous to [[audio feedback]]. The honeycomb illusion was created using a shaped lens. The video was edited within five hours because it was due to be broadcast the same week in which it was taped. The video was sent to the BBC as soon as it was completed and aired for the first time on ''Top of the Pops'' in November 1975.{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}} After a few weeks at number one, an edit of the video was created.

The UK music papers reacted with bemusement, recognising that the song was original and technically accomplished, but they mostly remained indifferent. Pete Erskine of ''[[NME]]'' observed that, \"It'll be interesting to see whether it'll be played in its entirety on the radio. It's performed extremely well, but more in terms of production than anything else... Someone somewhere has decided that the boys' next release must sound 'epic'. And it does.

'Bohemian Rhapsody' is full of drama, passion and romance and sounds rather like one of those mini-opera affairs that [[Pete Townshend|Pete Townsend]] [''sic''] used to tack on to the end of [[The Who|Who]] albums\", before concluding, \"The significance of the composition eludes me totally, though I must admit to finding it horrifically fascinating.

It's a classic example of the unity in diversity that high-minded musical commentators have heard in the symphonies of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] or the operas of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]].

They observed both songs were \"a slow, introspective beginning and gradual climb to a raging metal jam and back again\", with the notable distinction being \"while Zeppelin meshed [[Folk music|folk]] influences with heavy metal, Queen opted for the light grandeur of the operetta as part of its hard rock\". They said \"for sheer cleverness alone, not to mention May's riveting electric work, 'Bohemian Rhapsody' rightfully became one of the top singles of 1975 and established Queen in the elite of seventies rock bands\".<ref name=\"Prown/Newquist\"/>\n\nIn 2015, ''[[The Economist]]'' described it as \"one of the most innovative pieces of the progressive rock era\".

As the heavy rock segment followed, the band would return to the stage.\n}}\nThe ''a cappella'' opening was too complex to perform live, so Mercury tried various ways of introducing the song. When the song \"Mustapha\" became a live favourite, Mercury would often sub in that song's ''a cappella'' opening, which was easier to reproduce live as it was only one voice. During the [[Hot Space Tour]], and occasionally at other times, Mercury would do a piano improvisation (generally the introduction to \"Death on Two Legs\") that ended with the first notes of the song. Often, the preceding song would end, and Mercury would sit at the piano, say a quick word and start playing the ballad section.\n[[File:Hannover7907.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Three members of the group during a live performance in Hanover. From left to right, John Deacon (stood casually), Roger Taylor (playing, sat at drum kit), and Brian May (appears to be playing intensely).

Behind that is a large set of multicoloured lights raised above the stage.|From left to right: Deacon, Taylor and May in concert in [[Hanover]] in 1979. Behind the drum kit is the [[tam-tam]] used at the end of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\".]]\nInitially following the song's release, the operatic middle section proved a problem for the band. Because of extensive multi-tracking, it could not be performed on stage. The band did not have enough of a break between the [[Sheer Heart Attack Tour|Sheer Heart Attack]] and [[A Night at the Opera Tour|A Night at the Opera]] tours to find a way to make it work live, so they split the song into three sections that were played throughout the night. The opening and closing ballads were played as part of a medley, with \"[[Killer Queen]]\" and \"March of the Black Queen\" taking the place of the operatic and hard rock sections. In 1976 concerts where the same medley was played, the operatic section from the album would be played from tape as the introduction to the setlist. During this playback, Mercury would appear briefly to sing live for the line, \"I see a little sillhouetto of a man\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jonh-ingham.blogspot.ca/2007/02/queen-riot-at-opera.html|title=Queen: A Riot At The Opera|author=Ingham, John|date=29 November 1975|accessdate=4 December 2014}}</ref> As the song segued into the hard rock section, the band would emerge on the smoke filled stage\u2014the playback would end at this point, and the hard rock section would be performed live (without the final ballad section, which appeared later in the set).\n\nStarting with the [[A Day at the Races Tour]] in 1977, the band adopted their lasting way of playing the song live. The opening ballad would be played on stage, and after Brian May's guitar solo, the lights would go down, the band would leave the stage, and the operatic section would be played from tape, while coloured stage lights provided a light show based around the voices of the opera section. Most playings of the opera section from the tape would often be accompanied by a portion of the song's music video containing the footage used for the operatic portion of the song. Other playings would be played over montages of footage filmed from the band members' other experiences throughout their daily lives. A blast of [[pyrotechnics]] after Roger Taylor's high note on the final \"for me\" would announce the band's return for the hard rock section and closing ballad. Queen played the song in this form all through the Magic Tour of 1986. This style was also used for [[the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert]], with [[Elton John]] singing the opening ballad and then after the taped operatic section, [[Axl Rose]] singing the hard rock section. John and Rose sang the closing ballad part together in a duet.\n\n\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was performed by [[Queen + Paul Rodgers]] throughout their tours, accompanied by a video of Mercury.{{Sfn|Daily Telegraph|2008}} Footage from the ''[[Live at Wembley '86]]'' was used for the [[Queen + Paul Rodgers Tour|2005-6 tour]], and the [[Queen Rock Montreal|1981 Montreal performance]] used for the [[Rock the Cosmos Tour]]. As with the Queen tours, the band went backstage for the operatic section, which was accompanied by a video tribute to Freddie Mercury. When the hard rock section began, the lights came back up to the full band on stage, including Rodgers, who took over lead vocals. Rodgers duetted with the recording of Mercury for the \"outro\" section, allowing the audience to sing the final \"Nothing really matters to me\", while the taped Mercury took a bow for the crowd. Rodgers would then repeat the line, and the final line (\"Any way the wind blows\") was delivered with one last shot of Mercury smiling at the audience. Commenting upon this staging, Brian May says that they \"had to rise to the challenge of getting Freddie in there in a way which gave him his rightful place, but without demeaning Paul in any way. It also kept us live and 'present', although conscious and proud of our past, as we logically should be.\"{{Sfn|Chiu|2005}}\n\nSince 2012, May and Taylor have toured with former ''[[American Idol]]'' contestant [[Adam Lambert]] under the name [[Queen + Adam Lambert]] (following two one-off performances together in 2009 and 2011), with \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" regularly included at the end of their set.<ref>{{cite news |first=Dave |last=Simpson |title=Queen and Adam Lambert review \u2013 an unlikely union, but it works |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/14/queen-adam-lambert-live-review-arena-newcastle |newspaper=The Guardian |date=14 January 2015 |accessdate=16 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |first=Ellise |last=Shafer |title=Queen and Adam Lambert Play the Hits, Pay Tribute to Freddie Mercury at L.A.

In its early stages I almost rejected it, but then it grew. We started deciding on a single about halfway through. There were a few contenders\u2014we were thinking of \"[[The Prophet's Song]]\" at one point\u2014but then \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" seemed the one. There was a time when the others wanted to chop it around a bit, but I refused. If it was going to be released, it would be in its entirety. We knew it was very risky, but we had so much confidence in that song\u2014I did anyway. I felt, underneath it all, that if it was successful it would earn a lot of respect. People were all going, You're joking, they'll never play it, you'll only hear the first few bars and then they'll fade it out. We had numerous rows. EMI were shocked\u2014a six-minute single? You must be joking! The same in America\u2014oh, you just got away with it in Britain.<ref>Freddie Mercury Interview, January 1976, ''Sounds''</ref>|Freddie Mercury, 1976}}\n\n{{quote|When we finished the album, the ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|Night at the Opera]]'' album, that was the track on it that we thought we were gonna release as a single in the UK first. And when we released it in Britain we didn't necessarily think it'd be released in America, cause we know even over here, you know, the AM tastes are even more [hesitates] stricter. Anyway we did have thoughts about even in the UK, perhaps editing it down at all, but we listened to it over and over again and there was no way we could edit it. We tried a few ideas, but if you edited it, you always lost some part of the song, so we had to leave it all in. And luckily it took off anyway.|John Deacon, 1977}}\n\n{{quote|The vocal harmonies was something we wanted to do from the beginning, as we are always keen to do that kind of thing. We wanted to be a group that could do the heaviness of hard rock, but also have harmonies swooping around all over the place. We thought there was some real power and emotion in that combination.

Then we went out to eat dinner.\"  Guitarist [[Brian May]] said the band thought that Mercury's blueprint for the song was \"intriguing and original, and worthy of work\".{{Sfn|Chiu|2005}} According to May, much of Queen's material was written in the studio, but this song \"was all in Freddie's mind\" before they started.{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}} In an interview during the band's Australian tour early in 1985, Mercury said, \"It was basically three songs that I wanted to put out and I just put the three together.\"<ref>{{cite av media|title=Freddie Mercury-Interview in Sydney 1985 (1080p) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2RoYpUoRkY |date=6 January 2014|website=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nQueen spent a month rehearsing at [[Ridge Farm Studio]] in [[Surrey]] in mid-1975, and drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]] recalled that \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was one of the songs the band worked on while they were at Ridge Farm.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jessica |last=Salter |title=Roger Taylor remembers rehearsing with Queen in 1975 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/8344914/Roger-Taylor-remembers-rehearsing-with-Queen-in-1975.html |newspaper=[[Daily Telegraph]] |date=26 February 2011 |accessdate=12 March 2019}}</ref> Recording began on 24 August 1975 at [[Rockfield Studios|Rockfield Studio 1]] near [[Monmouth]], [[South Wales]], after a three-week rehearsal at [[Penrhos, Herefordshire|Penrhos Court]], near [[Kington, Herefordshire]]. During the making of the track, four additional studios (Roundhouse, [[Sarm East Studios]], [[Scorpio Sound]], and [[Wessex Sound Studios]]) were used.{{Sfn|Cunningham|1995}} According to some band members, Mercury mentally prepared the song beforehand and directed the band throughout.{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}} Mercury used a [[C. Bechstein]] concert grand piano, which he played in the promotional video and the UK tour. Due to the elaborate nature of the song, it was recorded in various sections.{{Sfn|Hodkinson|2004|p=192}} The piano was the same one [[Paul McCartney]] had used to record [[the Beatles]]' song \"[[Hey Jude]]\".<ref name=\"Horton\"/>\n\nBaker recalled in 1999:\n\n{{quote|\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was totally insane, but we enjoyed every minute of it. It was basically a joke, but a successful joke. [Laughs]. We had to record it in three separate units. We did the whole beginning bit, then the whole middle bit and then the whole end. It was complete madness. The middle part started off being just a couple of seconds, but Freddie kept coming in with more \"Galileos\" and we kept on adding to the opera section, and it just got bigger and bigger.

In the end, eighth-generation tapes were used.{{Sfn|Cunningham|1995}} The various sections of tape containing the desired sub-mixes had to be [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|spliced]] (cut and assembled in the correct sequence). May recalled placing a tape in front of the light and being able to see through it, as the tape had been used so many times.{{Sfn|Classic Albums | 2006}} A similar story was told in 1977 by Taylor regarding the elaborate overdubs and sub-mixes for \"The March of The Black Queen\" for the album ''[[Queen II]]''.

May stated that he wanted to compose \"a little tune that would be a counterpart to the main melody; I didn't just want to play the melody\". The guitarist said that his better material stems from this way of working: in which he thought of the tune before playing it: \"the fingers tend to be predictable unless being led by the brain.\"{{Sfn | BBC| 2004b}} According to Baker, \"the end of the song was much heavier because it was one of the first mixes to be done with [[mix automation|automation]]... If you really listen to it, the ballad starts off clean, and as the opera section gets louder and louder, the vocals get more and more distorted. You can still hear this on the CD.

The lyrics question whether life is \"real\" or \"just fantasy caught in a [[landslide]]\" before concluding that there can be \"no escape from reality\".\n\nAfter 20 seconds, the grand piano enters, the song modulates briefly to E{{Music|flat}} major and Mercury's voice alternates with the other vocal parts. The narrator introduces himself as \"just a poor boy\" but declares that he \"needs no sympathy\" because he is \"easy come, easy go\" and then \"little high, little low\" (when heard in [[Stereophonic sound|stereo]], the words \"little high\" come from the left speaker whereas the \"little low\" comes from the right); [[Diatonic and chromatic|chromatic]] [[Outside (jazz)|side-slipping]] on \"easy come, easy go\" highlights the dream-like atmosphere. The end of this section is marked by the bass entrance and the cross-handed piano [[vamp (music)|vamp]] in B{{Music|flat}}.\n\n===Ballad (0:49\u20132:37)===\n{{Listen\n|filename = QueenBohemianRhapsody Mama.ogg\n|title = \"Mama, just killed a man\"\n|description = This sample features the distinctive piano phrase in B{{Music|flat}} and the first line of the first verse.\n}}\nThe piano begins in B{{Music|flat}} major along with the entrance of [[John Deacon]]'s bass guitar, marking the onset of this section. After it plays twice, Mercury's vocals enter. Over the course of the section, the vocals evolve from a softly sung harmony to an impassioned solo performance by Mercury. The narrator explains to his mother that he has \"just killed a man,\" with \"a gun against his head\" and in doing so, has thrown his life away. This \"confessional\" section, Whiteley comments, is \"affirmative of the nurturant and life-giving force of the feminine and the need for absolution\".{{Sfn|Whiteley|2006|p=252}} In the middle of the verse (1:19), Taylor's drums enter, and a descending chromatic run leads to a temporary modulation to E{{Music|flat}} major (up one fourth). The narrator makes the second of several invocations to his \"mama\" in the new key, continuing the original theme. The narrator explains his regret over \"mak[ing] you cry\" and urging \"mama\" to \"carry on as if nothing really matters\". A brief, descending variation of the piano phrase connects to the second verse.\n\nThen the piano intro plays, marking the start of the second verse. As the ballad proceeds into its second verse, the speaker confesses how ashamed he is by his act of murder (as May enters on guitar and mimics the upper range of the piano at 1:50). May imitates a [[bell tree]] during the line \"sends shivers down my spine\", by playing the strings of his guitar on the other side of the bridge. The narrator bids the world goodbye announcing he has \"got to go\" and prepares to \"face the truth\" admitting \"I don't want to die / I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.\" This is where the guitar solo enters.\n\n===Guitar solo (2:37\u20133:05)===\nTowards the end of the ballad section, the band builds in intensity, incorporating a guitar solo (in E{{Music|flat}} major) played and originally composed by Mercury, later improvised by May.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-34651067|title=Brian May on 40 years of Bohemian Rhapsody: 'I still listen to it in the car'|last=May|first=Brian|date=29 October 2015|website=BBC|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The intensity continues to build, but once the bass line completes its descent establishing modulation to the new key (A major), the entire band cuts out abruptly at 3:03 except for quiet, staccato [[A major]] quaver (eighth-note) chords on the piano, marking the start of the \"Opera\" section.\n\n===Opera (3:05\u20134:07)===\n{{Listen\n|filename = QueenBohemianRhapsody_Opera.ogg\n|title = \"Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the fandango?\"\n|description = The operatic segment enters immediately as May's solo abruptly concludes. This vast shift in style is just one example of how the song rapidly changes throughout its running time.\n}}\nA rapid series of rhythmic and harmonic changes introduces a pseudo-operatic midsection, which contains the bulk of the elaborate vocal multi-tracking, depicting the narrator's descent into hell. While the underlying pulse of the song is maintained, the dynamics vary greatly from bar to bar, from only Mercury's voice accompanied by a piano to a multi-voice choir supported by drums, bass, piano, and [[timpani]]. The choir effect was created by having May, Mercury, and Taylor repeatedly sing their vocal parts, resulting in 180 separate overdubs. These overdubs were then combined into successive submixes. According to Roger Taylor, the voices of May, Mercury and himself combined created a wide vocal range: \"Brian could get down quite low, Freddie had a powerful voice through the middle, and I was good at the high stuff.\" The band wanted to create \"a [[Wall of Sound|wall of sound]], that starts down and goes all the way up\".{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}} The band used the [[bell effect]] for lyrics \"Magnifico\" and \"Let me go\". Also, on \"Let him go\", Taylor singing the top section carries his note on further after the rest of the \"choir\" have stopped singing.\n\nLyrical references in this passage include [[Scaramouche]], the [[fandango]], [[Galileo Galilei]], [[The Barber of Seville (play)|Figaro]], [[Beelzebub]] and [[Basmala|Bismillah]], as rival factions fight over the narrator's soul, some wishing to \"let [him] go\" and \"spare him his life from this monstrosity\", while others sending him \"thunderbolts and lightning,/very, very fright'ning [him]\". According to ''Freddie Mercury: The Definitive Biography'' by [[Lesley-Ann Jones]]' theory: It is also figurative representation of the four members, Mercury, May, Taylor and Deacon respectively. The section concludes with a full choral treatment of the lyric \"[[Beelzebub]] has a [[devil]] put aside for me!\", on a block [[B-flat major|B{{Music|flat}} major]] chord. Roger Taylor tops the final chord with a [[falsetto]] B{{Music|flat}} in the [[scientific pitch notation|fifth octave]] (B{{Music|flat}}5).\n\nUsing the 24-track technology available at the time, the \"opera\" section took about three weeks to finish.{{Sfn|Chiu|2005}} Producer Roy Thomas Baker said \"Every time Freddie came up with another 'Galileo', I would add another piece of tape to the reel.\"{{Sfn|Cunningham|1995}} Baker recalls that they kept wearing out the tape, which meant having to do transfers.{{Sfn|Chiu|2005}}\n\n=== Hard rock (4:07\u20134:54)===\nThe operatic section leads into a rock interlude with a [[riff|guitar riff]] written by Mercury. At 4:15, a [[double tracking|quadruple-tracked]] Mercury (in stereo, the four parts are panned two on the left and two on the right) sings angry lyrics addressed to an unspecified \"you\", accusing them of betrayal and abuse and insisting \"can't do this to me, baby\", before the final lines conclude that the singer \"just gotta get right outta\" an unspecified \"here\". Three ascending guitar runs follow. Mercury then plays a similar B{{Music|flat}} run on the piano, as the song builds up to the finale with a [[Andantino (music)|''ritardando'']].\n\n===Outro (4:54\u20135:55)===\nAfter Mercury plays ascending octaves of notes from the B{{Music|flat}} [[Key of D Mixolydian mode (scale)|mixolydian]] mode (composed of the notes from the E{{Music|flat}} scale), the song then returns to the tempo and form of the introduction, initially in E{{Music|flat}} major, before quickly modulating to [[C minor]], only to soon go through an abrupt short series of modulations, bringing it back to [[C minor]] again in time for the final \"nothing really matters\" section. A guitar accompanies the chorus \"ooh, ooh yeah, ooh yeah.\" A double-tracked twin guitar melody is played through an amplifier designed by John Deacon, affectionately nicknamed the \"[[Deacy Amp]]\". Mercury's line \"Nothing really matters{{nbsp}}...\" appears again, \"cradled by light piano arpeggios suggesting both resignation (minor tonalities) and a new sense of freedom in the wide vocal span\".{{Sfn|Whiteley|2006|p=253}} After the line \"nothing really matters\" is repeated multiple times, the song finally concludes in the key of E{{Music|flat}} major, but then changes again to F major just before it ends. The final line, \"Any way the wind blows\", is followed by the quiet sound of a large [[tam-tam]] that finally expels the tension built up throughout the song.\n\n==Lyrics==\n''[[The New York Times]]'' commented that \"the song's most distinct feature is the fatalistic lyrics\". Mercury refused to explain his composition other than to say it was about relationships; the band is still protective of the song's secret.{{Sfn|Chiu|2005}} Brian May supports suggestions that the song contained veiled references to Mercury's personal traumas. He recalls \"Freddie was a very complex person: flippant and funny on the surface, but he concealed insecurities and problems in squaring up his life with his childhood. He never explained the lyrics, but I think he put a lot of himself into that song.\"{{Sfn|Black|2002}} May, though, says the band had agreed that the core of a lyric was a private issue for the composer.{{Sfn|Chiu|2005}} In a [[BBC Three]] documentary about the making of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", Roger Taylor maintains that the true meaning of the song is \"fairly self-explanatory with just a bit of nonsense in the middle\".{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}}\n\n{{quote box\n| salign = left\n| quote = It's one of those songs which has such a fantasy feel about it. I think people should just listen to it, think about it, and then make up their own minds as to what it says to them... \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" didn't just come out of thin air.

Why not?\n| source = \u2014Freddie Mercury{{Sfn|Davis|1993|p=20}}\n| align = left\n| width = 33%\n}}\n\nWhen the band released a ''Greatest Hits'' cassette in Iran, a leaflet in [[Farsi language|Persian]] was included with translation and explanations (refers to a book published in Iran called ''The March of the Black Queen'' by Sarah Sefati and Farhad Arkani, which included the whole biography of the band and complete lyrics with Persian translation (2000)). In the explanation, Queen states that \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" is about a young man who has accidentally killed someone and, like [[Faust]], sold his soul to the devil. On the night before his execution, he calls for God saying, \"[[Basmala|Bismillah]]\" (\"In the name of God\" in Arabic), and with the help of angels, regains his soul from [[Devil (Islam)|Shaitan]] (the devil in Islam).{{Sfn|BBC|2004a}}\n\nDespite this, critics, both journalistic and academic, have speculated over the meaning behind the song's lyrics. Some believe the lyrics describe a suicidal murderer haunted by demons or depict events just preceding an execution. The latter explanation points to [[Albert Camus]]'s novel ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'', in which a young man confesses to an impulsive murder and has an epiphany before he is executed, as probable inspiration. Others believe the lyrics were only written to fit with the music, and have no meaning; the DJ, television entertainer and comedian [[Kenny Everett]], who played an influential role in popularising the single on his radio show on [[Capital London|Capital Radio]], quoted Mercury as claiming the lyrics were simply \"random rhyming nonsense\".{{Sfn|Black|2002}}\n\nStill, others interpreted them as Mercury's way of dealing with personal issues.{{Sfn|Chiu|2005}} Music scholar Sheila Whiteley observes that Mercury reached a turning point in his personal life in the year he wrote \"Bohemian Rhapsody\".{{Sfn|Whiteley|2006|p=252}} He had been living with Mary Austin for seven years but had just embarked on his first love affair with a man. She suggests that the song provides an insight into Mercury's emotional state at the time, \"living with Mary ('Mamma', as in [[Mother Mary]]) and wanting to break away ('Mamma Mia let me go')\".{{Sfn|Whiteley|2006|p=253}} Others suggest it as veiled reference to [[coming out]], and dealing with the grave repercussions of the [[sodomy law]]s of the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/is-queens-bohemian-rhapsody-actually-about-coming-out-guy-branum-book-excerpt/|title=Is Queen's \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" Actually About Coming Out? - Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com|accessdate=7 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n[[File:Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen US vinyl red label.png|thumb|One of Side-A labels of the US single release]]\nWhen the band wanted to release the single in 1975, various executives suggested to them that, at 5 minutes and 55 seconds, it was too long and would never be a hit.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bohemian rhapsody celebrates 40 YEARS: 19 things you didn't know about the queen anthem |url=http://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/music/615750/Bohemian-Rhapsody-facts-Queen-40-years-anniversary |work=Express Online |date=30 October 2015 |access-date=28 September 2016}}</ref> The song was played to other musicians who commented the band had no hope of it ever being played on radio.{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}} According to producer Roy Thomas Baker, he and the band bypassed this corporate decision by playing the song for [[Capital Radio]] DJ [[Kenny Everett]]: \"we had a reel-to-reel copy but we told him he could only have it if he promised not to play it. 'I won't play it,' he said, winking ...\"{{Sfn|Cunningham|1995}} Their plan worked\u2014Everett teased his listeners by playing only parts of the song. Audience demand intensified when Everett played the full song on his show 14 times in two days.{{Sfn|Chiu|2005}} Hordes of fans attempted to buy the single the following Monday, only to be told by record stores that it had not yet been released.{{Sfn|Cunningham|1995}} The same weekend, Paul Drew, who ran the [[RKO General]] stations in the States, heard the track on Everett's show in London. Drew managed to get a copy of the tape and started to play it in the States, which forced the hand of Queen's US label, [[Elektra Records|Elektra]]. In an interview with ''[[Sound on Sound]]'', Baker reflects that \"it was a strange situation where radio on both sides of the Atlantic was breaking a record that the record companies said would never get airplay!\"{{Sfn|Cunningham|1995}} Eventually the unedited single was released, with \"I'm in Love with My Car\" as the [[B-side]]. Following Everett's escapade in October 1975, [[Eric Hall]], a record plugger, gave a copy to [[David Hamilton (broadcaster)|David \"Diddy\" Hamilton]] to play on his weekday Radio One show.

The second was upon its re-release (as a double A-side single with \"[[These Are the Days of Our Lives]]\") in 1991 following Mercury's death, staying at number one for five weeks.\n\nIn the United States, the single was also a success, although to a lesser extent than in the UK. The single, released in December 1975, reached number nine on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] for sales of one million copies.<ref name=\"RIAA\" /> In a retrospective article, [[Anthony DeCurtis]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' explained why the song performed less strongly in the US charts by saying that it is \"the quintessential example of the kind of thing that doesn't exactly go over well in America\".{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}} Its chart run of 24 weeks, however, placed it at number 18 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s year-end chart, higher than some number ones of the year.<ref name=\"BillboardYE1976\" /> With the Canadian record-buying public, the single fared better, reaching number one in the ''RPM'' national singles chart for the week ending 1 May 1976.<ref name=\"RPMTop100\"/>\n\n\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was re-released as a double A-side cassette single with \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\" in January 1992 following the death of Freddie Mercury, with proceeds going to the [[Magic Johnson Foundation]] for AIDS research.

A promo video also allowed the artist to have their music broadcast and accompanied by their own choice of visuals, rather than dancers such as [[Pan's People]]. According to May, the video was produced so that the band could avoid miming on ''Top of the Pops'', since they would have looked off miming to such a complex song.{{Sfn|Black|2002}} He also said that the band knew they would be set to appear at [[Dundee]]'s [[Caird Hall]] on tour and unable to appear on the programme anyway.{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}} The video has been hailed as launching the MTV age.{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}}\n\nThe band used Trillion, a subsidiary of [[Trident Studios]], their former management company and recording studio. They hired one of their trucks and got it to [[Elstree Studios]], where the band were rehearsing for their tour. The video was directed by [[Bruce Gowers]], who had directed a video of the band's 1974 performance at the [[Rainbow Theatre]] in London, and was recorded by cameraman Barry Dodd and [[assistant director]]/[[floor manager]] Jim McCutcheon. The video was recorded in just four hours on 10 November 1975, at a cost of \u00a34,500.{{Sfn|Hodkinson|2004|p=192}} Gowers reported that the band was involved in the discussion of the video and the end result, and \"was a co-operative to that extent, but there was only one leader.\"{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}}\n\nThe video opens with a shot of the four band members in near darkness as they sing the ''a cappella'' part. The lights fade up, and the shots cross-fade into close-ups of Freddie. The composition of the shot is the same as [[Mick Rock]]'s cover photograph for their second album ''[[Queen II]]''. The photo, inspired by a photograph of actress [[Marlene Dietrich]], was the band's favourite image of themselves.{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}} The video then fades into them playing their instruments. In the opera section of the video, the scene reverts to the ''Queen II'' standing positions, after which they perform once again on stage during the hard rock segment. In the closing seconds of the video Roger Taylor is depicted stripped to the waist, striking the [[Gong|tam tam]] in the manner of the trademark of the [[Rank Organisation]]'s [[Gongman]], familiar in the UK as the opening of all Rank film productions.\n\nAll of the special effects were achieved during the recording, rather than editing. The visual effect of Mercury's face cascading away (during the echoed line \"Magnifico\") was accomplished by pointing the camera at a monitor, giving [[optical feedback|visual feedback]], a glare analogous to [[audio feedback]].

The UK music papers reacted with bemusement, recognising that the song was original and technically accomplished, but they mostly remained indifferent. Pete Erskine of ''[[NME]]'' observed that, \"It'll be interesting to see whether it'll be played in its entirety on the radio. It's performed extremely well, but more in terms of production than anything else... Someone somewhere has decided that the boys' next release must sound 'epic'. And it does.

'Bohemian Rhapsody' is full of drama, passion and romance and sounds rather like one of those mini-opera affairs that [[Pete Townshend|Pete Townsend]] [''sic''] used to tack on to the end of [[The Who|Who]] albums\", before concluding, \"The significance of the composition eludes me totally, though I must admit to finding it horrifically fascinating.

He said it was \"unique at this point to hear a hit single in this style\", it was \"more accessible than other music of the genre\" and was \"able to communicate beyond the usual confines of the style\".<ref name=\"Eisentraut\"/> Author and progressive rock historian Stephen Lambe called it a \"remarkable\" single and said it \"provides a neat but coincidental bridge between prog in its prime and the move to more aggressive songwriting\", suggesting the song \"feels like a grotesque (although probably unintentional) parody of progressive rock\".<ref name=\"Lambe\"/> ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide|The New Rolling Stone Album Guide]]'' described it as \"either a prog-rock benchmark or the most convoluted [[novelty song]] ever recorded\".<ref>{{cite book|editor1=Nathan Brackett|editor2=Christian Hoard|title=The New Rolling Stone Album Guide|year=2004|page=[https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac/page/668 668]|publisher=Simon & Schuster Ltd|isbn=978-0743201698|url=https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac/page/668}}</ref> Writing for the [[BBC]] in 2015, the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''{{'}}s music critic [[Greg Kot]] called it a \"prog-rock pocket [[operetta]]\" and said the song's \"reign as a work of wigged-out genius rather than a dated gimmick testifies to its go-for-broke attitude\u2014one that has resonated across generations\".<ref name=\"Kot\"/>\n\nIn 2009, ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s music critic, [[Tom Service]], examined the song's relationship with the traditions of [[classical music]], describing its popularity as \"one of the strangest musical phenomena out there\":\n\n{{quote|The precedents of Bohemian Rhapsody are as much in the 19th-century classical traditions of rhapsodic, quasi-improvisational reveries\u2014like, say, the piano works of [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]] or [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]] or the tone-poems of [[Richard Strauss|Strauss]] or [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]]\u2014as they are in prog-rock or the contemporary pop of 1975. That's because the song manages a sleight of musical hand that only a handful of real master-musicians have managed: the illusion that its huge variety of styles\u2014from intro, to ballad, to operatic excess, to hard-rock, to reflective coda\u2014are unified into a single statement, a drama that somehow makes sense. It's a classic example of the unity in diversity that high-minded musical commentators have heard in the symphonies of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] or the operas of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]. And that's exactly what the piece is: a miniature operatic-rhapsodic-symphonic-tone-poem.<ref name=\"service\"/>}}\n\nComparison was also made between the song and [[Led Zeppelin]]'s 1971 epic \"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\" by music writers [[Pete Prown]] and [[HP Newquist]]. They observed both songs were \"a slow, introspective beginning and gradual climb to a raging metal jam and back again\", with the notable distinction being \"while Zeppelin meshed [[Folk music|folk]] influences with heavy metal, Queen opted for the light grandeur of the operetta as part of its hard rock\". They said \"for sheer cleverness alone, not to mention May's riveting electric work, 'Bohemian Rhapsody' rightfully became one of the top singles of 1975 and established Queen in the elite of seventies rock bands\".<ref name=\"Prown/Newquist\"/>\n\nIn 2015, ''[[The Economist]]'' described it as \"one of the most innovative pieces of the progressive rock era\".

Gracyk suggests that beginning the tape in the middle of the song after \"the lyrics which provide the song's narrative ... forces the film's audience to respond to its presence in the scene without the 'commentary' of the lyrics\".{{Sfn|Gracyk|2007|p=63}} Helped by the song, the soundtrack album of the film was a major hit.{{Sfn|Gracyk|2007|p=65}}\n\nIn connection with this, a new video was released, interspersing excerpts from the film with footage from the original Queen video, along with some live footage of the band. Myers was horrified that the record company had mixed clips from ''Wayne's World'' with Queen's original video, fearing that this would upset the band. He said, \"they've just [[Urination|whizzed]] on a [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]].\" He asked the record company to tell Queen that the video was not his idea, and that he apologised to them.

As the heavy rock segment followed, the band would return to the stage.\n}}\nThe ''a cappella'' opening was too complex to perform live, so Mercury tried various ways of introducing the song. When the song \"Mustapha\" became a live favourite, Mercury would often sub in that song's ''a cappella'' opening, which was easier to reproduce live as it was only one voice. During the [[Hot Space Tour]], and occasionally at other times, Mercury would do a piano improvisation (generally the introduction to \"Death on Two Legs\") that ended with the first notes of the song. Often, the preceding song would end, and Mercury would sit at the piano, say a quick word and start playing the ballad section.\n[[File:Hannover7907.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Three members of the group during a live performance in Hanover. From left to right, John Deacon (stood casually), Roger Taylor (playing, sat at drum kit), and Brian May (appears to be playing intensely).

Behind the drum kit is the [[tam-tam]] used at the end of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\".]]\nInitially following the song's release, the operatic middle section proved a problem for the band. Because of extensive multi-tracking, it could not be performed on stage. The band did not have enough of a break between the [[Sheer Heart Attack Tour|Sheer Heart Attack]] and [[A Night at the Opera Tour|A Night at the Opera]] tours to find a way to make it work live, so they split the song into three sections that were played throughout the night. The opening and closing ballads were played as part of a medley, with \"[[Killer Queen]]\" and \"March of the Black Queen\" taking the place of the operatic and hard rock sections. In 1976 concerts where the same medley was played, the operatic section from the album would be played from tape as the introduction to the setlist. During this playback, Mercury would appear briefly to sing live for the line, \"I see a little sillhouetto of a man\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jonh-ingham.blogspot.ca/2007/02/queen-riot-at-opera.html|title=Queen: A Riot At The Opera|author=Ingham, John|date=29 November 1975|accessdate=4 December 2014}}</ref> As the song segued into the hard rock section, the band would emerge on the smoke filled stage\u2014the playback would end at this point, and the hard rock section would be performed live (without the final ballad section, which appeared later in the set).\n\nStarting with the [[A Day at the Races Tour]] in 1977, the band adopted their lasting way of playing the song live. The opening ballad would be played on stage, and after Brian May's guitar solo, the lights would go down, the band would leave the stage, and the operatic section would be played from tape, while coloured stage lights provided a light show based around the voices of the opera section. Most playings of the opera section from the tape would often be accompanied by a portion of the song's music video containing the footage used for the operatic portion of the song. Other playings would be played over montages of footage filmed from the band members' other experiences throughout their daily lives. A blast of [[pyrotechnics]] after Roger Taylor's high note on the final \"for me\" would announce the band's return for the hard rock section and closing ballad. Queen played the song in this form all through the Magic Tour of 1986. This style was also used for [[the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert]], with [[Elton John]] singing the opening ballad and then after the taped operatic section, [[Axl Rose]] singing the hard rock section. John and Rose sang the closing ballad part together in a duet.\n\n\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was performed by [[Queen + Paul Rodgers]] throughout their tours, accompanied by a video of Mercury.{{Sfn|Daily Telegraph|2008}} Footage from the ''[[Live at Wembley '86]]'' was used for the [[Queen + Paul Rodgers Tour|2005-6 tour]], and the [[Queen Rock Montreal|1981 Montreal performance]] used for the [[Rock the Cosmos Tour]]. As with the Queen tours, the band went backstage for the operatic section, which was accompanied by a video tribute to Freddie Mercury. When the hard rock section began, the lights came back up to the full band on stage, including Rodgers, who took over lead vocals. Rodgers duetted with the recording of Mercury for the \"outro\" section, allowing the audience to sing the final \"Nothing really matters to me\", while the taped Mercury took a bow for the crowd. Rodgers would then repeat the line, and the final line (\"Any way the wind blows\") was delivered with one last shot of Mercury smiling at the audience.

In its early stages I almost rejected it, but then it grew. We started deciding on a single about halfway through. There were a few contenders\u2014we were thinking of \"[[The Prophet's Song]]\" at one point\u2014but then \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" seemed the one. There was a time when the others wanted to chop it around a bit, but I refused. If it was going to be released, it would be in its entirety. We knew it was very risky, but we had so much confidence in that song\u2014I did anyway. I felt, underneath it all, that if it was successful it would earn a lot of respect. People were all going, You're joking, they'll never play it, you'll only hear the first few bars and then they'll fade it out. We had numerous rows. EMI were shocked\u2014a six-minute single? You must be joking! The same in America\u2014oh, you just got away with it in Britain.<ref>Freddie Mercury Interview, January 1976, ''Sounds''</ref>|Freddie Mercury, 1976}}\n\n{{quote|When we finished the album, the ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|Night at the Opera]]'' album, that was the track on it that we thought we were gonna release as a single in the UK first. And when we released it in Britain we didn't necessarily think it'd be released in America, cause we know even over here, you know, the AM tastes are even more [hesitates] stricter. Anyway we did have thoughts about even in the UK, perhaps editing it down at all, but we listened to it over and over again and there was no way we could edit it. We tried a few ideas, but if you edited it, you always lost some part of the song, so we had to leave it all in. And luckily it took off anyway.|John Deacon, 1977}}\n\n{{quote|The vocal harmonies was something we wanted to do from the beginning, as we are always keen to do that kind of thing. We wanted to be a group that could do the heaviness of hard rock, but also have harmonies swooping around all over the place. We thought there was some real power and emotion in that combination. The guitar solo was pretty much off the cuff, except I think I had plenty of time to think about that one. I remember playing along with it in the studio for a while when other things were being done. I knew what kind of melody I wanted to play.|Brian May, 1982}}\n\n==Personnel==\n{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}}\n* [[Freddie Mercury]] \u2013 lead and backing vocals, piano, [[Opera#Operatic voices|operatic vocals]] (middle register)\n* [[Brian May]] \u2013 electric guitar, operatic vocals (low register)\n* [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]] \u2013 drums, [[timpani]], [[gong]], operatic vocals (high register)\n* [[John Deacon]] \u2013 bass guitar\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Bohemian Rhapsody cover versions]]\n* [[List of best-selling singles]]\n* [[List of best-selling singles in the United Kingdom]]\n* [[List of best-selling singles in the United States]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book|last=Hodkinson|first=Mark|year=2004|title=Queen: The Early Years|publisher=Music Sales Ltd|isbn=1-84449-012-2|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Pope|first=Rob|year=2002|title=The English Studies Book: An Introduction to Language, Literature and Culture|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-25709-3|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite news|work=BBC News|date=15 June 2011|title=Smashed Hits: What is a Bohemian Rhapsody?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-13761091|accessdate=25 September 2017|ref={{SfnRef|BBC|2011}}}}\n* {{cite book|last=Corn|first=John|year=2005|title=Britain Since 1948|publisher=Folens Publishers|isbn=1-84303-985-0|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Heatley|first=Michael|year=2008|title=Massive Music Moments|publisher=Collins and Brown|isbn=1-84340-493-1|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite video|people=Directed by Carl Johnston|date=4 December 2004|title=The Story of Bohemian Rhapsody|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0438465/|medium=Television production|publisher=BBC|ref={{SfnRef|BBC|2004b}}}}\n* {{cite book|last=Peraino|first=Judith|year=2005|title=Listening to the Sirens: Musical Technologies of Queer Identity from Homer to Hedwig|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0-520-21587-7|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite news|last=Chiu|first=David|title=Unconventional Queen Hit Still Rocks After 30 Years|work=The New York Times|accessdate=12 April 2010|url=https://nytimes.com/2005/12/27/arts/music/27quee.html?ex=1293339600anden=5825caa9f4db1fb0andei=5090|ref=harv|date=27 December 2005}}\n* {{cite news|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London|title=Muppets' Bohemian Rhapsody takes YouTube by storm|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/6714562/Muppets-Bohemian-Rhapsody-takes-YouTube-by-storm.html|accessdate=10 April 2010|ref={{SfnRef|Daily Telegraph|2009}}|first=Nick|last=Allen|date=3 December 2009}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Davis|first=Andy|year=1993|title=Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody|work=Record Collector|issue=167|page=20|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite web |last=Black |first=Johnny |year=2002 |title=The Greatest Songs Ever!

Its sweeping landscape and surrounding mountain range have been the muse of treasured American artists from Remington to Borein to Gollings, and the setting for rich cultural traditions integral to the American Indian tribes inhabiting this region. Today, it serves as a gleaming example of Wyoming's transformation, and continues to delight and inspire artists and guests from around the world.\n\nAt the heart of The Brinton Museum is the art, historic documents, books and furnishings that made up Bradford Brinton's original collection, which showcase the elegant and eclectic tastes of this well-educated Western gentleman. The permanent collection is on display in long-term exhibitions in the new facility as well as in its original setting in the Brinton Ranch House, and complemented by frequently changing shows featuring art of the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries. Each exhibition has been thoughtfully curated to tell a distinctive story of the American West through historical and contemporary perspectives. Through careful preservation and discriminating acquisition of new pieces, The Brinton honors the art and craftsmanship of the West and Bradford Brinton's intent to support both.\n\nThe Brinton's world-class staff guides visitors to understand celebrated artists of the past, their works, and how they\u2019ve inspired contemporary artists to explore and expand the art of the American West. Through home and museum tours, hands-on educational programming, artists\u2019 series and a variety of special events that celebrate The Brinton and the riches of the Quarter Circle A Ranch, students of all ages leave The Brinton Museum with a deeper connection to art, American history, and the spectacular environment that surrounds them.\n\n== Today ==\nThe Brinton Museum opened its new state-of-the-art Forrest E. Mars, Jr. Building on June 15, 2015. Located on the 620-acre historic Quarter Circle A Ranch in Big Horn, WY, the new 24,000-square-foot $15.8-million, eco-conscious museum houses one of the most significant and extensive 19th and 20th century Western and American Indian Art collections in the U.S. featuring [[Frederic Remington]], [[Charles Russell]], [[Thomas Moran]], [[Edward Borein]], [[Winold Reiss]], and the largest [[Hans Kleiber]] collection in the world. It includes four galleries, a museum store and the Brinton Bistro, which offers indoor and outdoor dining with 180-degree views of the Bighorn Mountains. Many generous private donors and foundations helped to make the new Forrest E. Mars, Jr. Building possible.\n\nThe new three-story space was designed by the Sheridan, WY Architecture/ Engineering firm of Malone Belton Abel P.C. to reveal and honor the beauty of the area, while aligning with the natural geography of the ranch. Nestled into the hillside, it is anchored by a two-foot thick, 51-foot high, 209-foot long arced structural rammed earth wall, the tallest in North America. Principal Architect Timothy Belton, AIA, explains the design as symbolically integrating the space, honoring both the original family that began the collection and the spiritual nature of its American Indian Art collections. Climate-controlled galleries and a 4,000-square foot high-tech storage facility can now accommodate thousands of pieces of art, allowing The Brinton Museum to better preserve and exhibit current and new works and collections by iconic artists.\n\nConstruction of the new spaces and storage facility allowed The Brinton Museum to receive The Gallatin Collection,gifted to the museum by Fr. Peter Powell of the Foundation for the Preservation of American Indian Art and Culture in Chicago. Originally compiled by the Gallatin Family in Big Horn, highlights of the collection have been on view at the Art Institute of Chicago for more than 45 years. The complete collection features more than 100 pieces of American Indian art and artifacts, 60 of which are on permanent display in The Brinton Museum's new John and Adrienne Mars American Indian Gallery.\n\nBradford Brinton's sister, Helen Brinton, founded The Brinton Museum in 1960, and it was opened to the public as the Bradford Brinton Memorial in June 1961. Her mission was to share Brinton's original collection of art, historic documents, books and furnishings assembled in the early 1900s, which showcase the elegant and eclectic tastes of a well-educated Western gentleman who befriended and supported the top artists of his time. Today, The Brinton Museum showcases its historic and contemporary collections in long-term and changing exhibitions in the original Brinton Ranch House and throughout its new Western, American Indian and contemporary galleries. The Quarter Circle A Ranch also includes expansive gardens and a greenhouse, Little Goose Creek Lodge, and multiple 1900s-era buildings such as the Carriage Barn that houses a historic automobile, J.I. Case truck and various farm implements, and a saddle barn full of horse gear. In the next two years, The Brinton Museum also will convert its original 5,000-square-foot museum space into an education center.\n\n\u201cThe Brinton Museum is the only museum in the U.S. that maintains a significant historic and ever-expanding Western and American Indian art collection on a beautifully maintained historic property at the foot of a mountain range,\u201d said Schuster. \u201cThe art, as well as the Quarter Circle A Ranch property, are an American treasure.\u201d\n\nThe ranch was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on August 10, 1976.<ref name=\"nris\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.bbmandm.org/ Brinton Museum website]\n*{{NRHP url|id=76001961|title=Photos from the NRHP nomination|photos=y}}\n\n{{National Register of Historic Places}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Ranches on the National Register of Historic Places in Wyoming]]\n[[Category:Houses completed in 1893]]\n[[Category:Museums in Sheridan County, Wyoming]]\n[[Category:Farm museums in Wyoming]]\n[[Category:Art museums in Wyoming]]\n[[Category:National Register of Historic Places in Sheridan County, Wyoming]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|Bradford Brinton's collection of Indian art|Frank Brinton's collection of early cinema |Brinton Collection}}\n{{Infobox NRHP\n  | name = The Brinton Museum\n  | nrhp_type = \n  | image = \n  | caption = \n  | nearest_city= [[Big Horn, Wyoming]]\n  | coordinates = {{coord|44|38|26|N|107|00|53|W|display=inline,title}}\n| locmapin = Wyoming#USA\n  | built = {{Start date|1893}}\n  | added = August 10, 1976\n  | area = {{convert|611|acre}}\n  | governing_body = Private \n  | refnum = 76001961<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n}}\nThe Brinton Museum located on the '''Quarter Circle A Ranch''' and formerly known as the Bradford Brinton Memorial Museum, is a museum and historic [[ranch]] located {{convert|2|mi}} southwest of [[Big Horn, Wyoming|Big Horn]], [[Wyoming]].

No, as in life, there's beauty in uncertainty.\" While praising Glover's songwriting and the features on ''3.15.20'', Jones criticized the production and vocals on a few of the album's tracks.<ref name=\"COS\"/> ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s reviewer Dean Van Nguyen acclaimed the album, saying that \"The actor, comedian and musician Donald Glover has made the first truly outstanding album of the decade, offsetting cultural examinations with moments of sweet levity.\" Nguyen further stated that the themes of the album fits to the present day insecurities with the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], saying that \"The disruption caused by the coronavirus forces us to question how strong the foundations of civilisation really are. Glover never could have seen the pandemic coming when he was recording the album, yet at a time when much of what we thought was strong is weak - what we thought was eternal is potentially fleeting \u2013 ''3.15.20'' captures the insecurity of lived reality and the humanity that truly defines our existence.\"<ref name=\"Nguyen\"/> Sam Moore of ''[[NME]]'' gave the album a favorable review, particularly praising Glover's decision to bring up more private matters on the album, referring to the song \"47.48\". Moore wrote that \"The rolling groove of '47.48' is another highlight: Glovers doomy proclamations about the violent and unjust aspects of society ('little boys playing 'round, shot down') eventually subside for a more optimistic outlook for the future as Glover sweetly interacts with his young son Legend about the people they each love.\" Moore continued by saying that \"Glover\u2019s willingness to share such a candid moment on record is particularly interesting given his past proclivity towards keeping his private life largely offline, and may be a sign that the star is beginning to let his guard down as the outside world continues to try to peer in.\"<ref name=\"NME\"/>\n\nSome reviews were more mixed. Debbie Ijaduola of [[Clash (magazine)|''Clash'']] unfavorably compared the album to Childish Gambino's previous efforts, stating that \"Lacking the strong narrative thrust so apparent on his [Glover's] past albums, the project is incredibly disappointing. From what it looks like, it seems like there was a reason he said he was quitting music.\" However, Ijaduola highlighted the songs \"Algorhythm\", \"42.26\" and \"47.48\" as the album's most enjoyable tracks.<ref name=\"Clash\"/> ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''{{'}}s critic Paul A. Thompson stated that \"''3.15.20'' is studded with little hooks and big ideas that serve as lures. Its spiritual largesse is weighed down by impulses carried halfway to their endpoints and moments of frustrating pretense.\" Thompson, alike other reviewers, praised the song \"47.48\", saying that the track \"sounds like a locked-in house band; the lyrics are actually about a crushing and ever-present violence, and the tension mesmerizes. That song ends with a conversation between Glover and his young son about love-sweeter than it sounds on paper, chilling given the juxtaposition.\"<ref name=\"PF\"/>\n\n== Track listing ==\nCredits are adapted from [[Tidal (service)|Tidal]].\n\n{{Track listing\n| extra_column = Producer(s)\n| total_length = 57:44\n| title_width = 20%\n| writing_width = 50%\n| extra_width = 30%\n\n| title1 = 0.00\n| writer1 = {{hlist|[[Donald Glover]]|[[James Francies|James Francies, Jr.]]|Denise Renee}}\n| extra1 = D.

No, as in life, there's beauty in uncertainty.\" While praising Glover's songwriting and the features on ''3.15.20'', Jones criticized the production and vocals on a few of the album's tracks.<ref name=\"COS\"/> ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s reviewer Dean Van Nguyen acclaimed the album, saying that \"The actor, comedian and musician Donald Glover has made the first truly outstanding album of the decade, offsetting cultural examinations with moments of sweet levity.\" Nguyen further stated that the themes of the album fits to the present day insecurities with the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], saying that \"The disruption caused by the coronavirus forces us to question how strong the foundations of civilisation really are. Glover never could have seen the pandemic coming when he was recording the album, yet at a time when much of what we thought was strong is weak - what we thought was eternal is potentially fleeting \u2013 ''3.15.20'' captures the insecurity of lived reality and the humanity that truly defines our existence.\"<ref name=\"Nguyen\"/> Sam Moore of ''[[NME]]'' gave the album a favorable review, particularly praising Glover's decision to bring up more private matters on the album, referring to the song \"47.48\". Moore wrote that \"The rolling groove of '47.48' is another highlight: Glovers doomy proclamations about the violent and unjust aspects of society ('little boys playing 'round, shot down') eventually subside for a more optimistic outlook for the future as Glover sweetly interacts with his young son Legend about the people they each love.\" Moore continued by saying that \"Glover\u2019s willingness to share such a candid moment on record is particularly interesting given his past proclivity towards keeping his private life largely offline, and may be a sign that the star is beginning to let his guard down as the outside world continues to try to peer in.\"<ref name=\"NME\"/>\n\nSome reviews were more mixed. Debbie Ijaduola of [[Clash (magazine)|''Clash'']] unfavorably compared the album to Childish Gambino's previous efforts, stating that \"Lacking the strong narrative thrust so apparent on his [Glover's] past albums, the project is incredibly disappointing. From what it looks like, it seems like there was a reason he said he was quitting music.\" However, Ijaduola highlighted the songs \"Algorhythm\", \"42.26\" and \"47.48\" as the album's most enjoyable tracks.<ref name=\"Clash\"/> ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''{{'}}s critic Paul A. Thompson stated that \"''3.15.20'' is studded with little hooks and big ideas that serve as lures. Its spiritual largesse is weighed down by impulses carried halfway to their endpoints and moments of frustrating pretense.\" Thompson, alike other reviewers, praised the song \"47.48\", saying that the track \"sounds like a locked-in house band; the lyrics are actually about a crushing and ever-present violence, and the tension mesmerizes. That song ends with a conversation between Glover and his young son about love-sweeter than it sounds on paper, chilling given the juxtaposition.\"<ref name=\"PF\"/>\n\n== Track listing ==\nCredits are adapted from [[Tidal (service)|Tidal]].\n\n{{Track listing\n| extra_column = Producer(s)\n| total_length = 57:44\n| title_width = 20%\n| writing_width = 50%\n| extra_width = 30%\n\n| title1 = 0.00\n| writer1 = {{hlist|[[Donald Glover]]|[[James Francies|James Francies, Jr.]]|Denise Renee}}\n| extra1 = D.
