This is a problem because advances in other fields of science are beginning to analyze large cell populations, increasing the need for a device that can monitor cells at such a level of sight. Cells cannot be used in many ways other than their main purpose, like detecting harmful substances. Merging this science with forms of nanotechnology could result in incredibly accurate detection methods. The preserving of human lives like protecting against bioterrorism is the biggest area of work being done in bioelectronics. Governments are starting to demand devices and materials that detect chemical and biological threats. The more the size of the devices decrease, there will be an increase in performance and capabilities.<ref name=\"nist\" />\n\n==See also ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=25em|\n*[[Biocomputer]]\n*[[Bioelectrochemical reactor]]\n*[[Bioelectrochemistry]]\n*[[Biosensors]]\n*[[Biological machine]]\n*[[Biomedical engineering]]\n*[[Dielectrophoresis]]\n*[[Electrochemical engineering]]\n*[[Electrophysiology]]\n*[[Electrotroph]]\n*[[Galvanism]]\n*[[GHK current equation]]\n*[[Hodgkin\u2013Huxley model]]\n*[[Implant (medicine)]]\n*[[Membrane potential]]\n*[[Multielectrode array]]\n*[[Nernst\u2013Planck equation]]\n*[[Neurophysics]]\n*[[Patch clamp]]\n*[[Quantitative models of the action potential]]\n*[[Saltatory conduction]]\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links ==\n{{wiktionary-inline|bioelectronics}}\n*[http://www.answers.com/topic/bioelectronics-1 Biolectronics] at Answers.com\n\n{{use mdy dates|date=April 2013}}\n\n[[Category:Electronics]]\n[[Category:Biotechnology]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Field of research in the convergence of biology and electronics}}\n{{for|article related to implanted bio-electronic devices and bioelectronic medicine|Implant (medicine)}}\n'''Bioelectronics''' is a field of research in the convergence of [[biology]] and [[electronics]].\n\n==Definitions==\n[[Image:Protein translation.gif|thumb|300px| A [[ribosome]] is a [[biological machine]] that utilizes [[protein dynamics]]]]\nAt the first C.E.C.

It was the most sophisticated form of electrical stimulation. It improved the impedance of electrodes in electrical stimulation, resulting in better recordings and reducing \"harmful electrochemical side reactions.\" Organic Electrochemical Transistors (OECT) were invented in 1984 by Mark Wrighton and colleagues, which had the ability to transport ions. This improved signal-to-noise ratio and gives for low measured impedance.

This is a problem because advances in other fields of science are beginning to analyze large cell populations, increasing the need for a device that can monitor cells at such a level of sight. Cells cannot be used in many ways other than their main purpose, like detecting harmful substances. Merging this science with forms of nanotechnology could result in incredibly accurate detection methods. The preserving of human lives like protecting against bioterrorism is the biggest area of work being done in bioelectronics. Governments are starting to demand devices and materials that detect chemical and biological threats. The more the size of the devices decrease, there will be an increase in performance and capabilities.<ref name=\"nist\" />\n\n==See also ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=25em|\n*[[Biocomputer]]\n*[[Bioelectrochemical reactor]]\n*[[Bioelectrochemistry]]\n*[[Biosensors]]\n*[[Biological machine]]\n*[[Biomedical engineering]]\n*[[Dielectrophoresis]]\n*[[Electrochemical engineering]]\n*[[Electrophysiology]]\n*[[Electrotroph]]\n*[[Galvanism]]\n*[[GHK current equation]]\n*[[Hodgkin\u2013Huxley model]]\n*[[Implant (medicine)]]\n*[[Membrane potential]]\n*[[Multielectrode array]]\n*[[Nernst\u2013Planck equation]]\n*[[Neurophysics]]\n*[[Patch clamp]]\n*[[Quantitative models of the action potential]]\n*[[Saltatory conduction]]\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links ==\n{{wiktionary-inline|bioelectronics}}\n*[http://www.answers.com/topic/bioelectronics-1 Biolectronics] at Answers.com\n\n{{use mdy dates|date=April 2013}}\n\n[[Category:Electronics]]\n[[Category:Biotechnology]]\n", "name_user": "MBirkholz", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eMaterials", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioelectronics"}

In June 1565 he was sent to pursue his education in France, having a yearly pension granted him by [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], payable out of her French dowry.  He spent two years at the [[University of Paris|universities of Paris]] and Orleans.  On 4 January 1568 he was confirmed by royal charter in the bishopric of Galloway and [[Abbot of Tongland|abbacy]] of [[Tongland Abbey|Tongland]], vacated in his favour by his father; the charter specifies his skill in classical and oriental tongues.  At this time he was in France, in the service of the Protestant leader, Prince [[Louis I Conde|Louis of Conde]], but he soon came to England, entered the service of [[Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk|Thomas, Duke of Norfolk]], and attended him at the conferences of York (October 1568) and Westminster (November 1568), held for the purpose of considering Mary's guilt.\n\nWhen Norfolk was sent to the [[Tower of London|Tower]] (October 1569), Gordon transferred his services to Mary herself, and seems to have remained with her till January 1572, when she was deprived of her household.  Mary commended him to the French king, and he enjoyed the post of gentleman ordinary of the privy chamber to [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]], [[Henry III of France|Henry III]], and [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], with a yearly pension of four hundred crowns.  He saved the lives of several countrymen at the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]], but never renounced Protestantism.  In 1574 he exhibited his [[Hebrew]] learning in a public disputation at [[Avignon]] with the chief rabbi Benetrius.  By his marriage in  1576 with Antoinette, widowed daughter of [[Rene de Marolles]], he acquired an estate which gave him the style of \"Sieur of Longorme\".  With the [[see of Galloway]] his connection was never more than nominal, the revenues going to his father or to his brother George.\n\nGordon is mentioned in 1588 as Bishop of Galloway; but he resigned his rights before 8 July 1586.  His first wife died in 1591.  He married in 1594 a strong Protestant, [[Genevieve Petau de Maulette|Genevieve]], daughter of Fran\u00e7ois Petau, sieur of [[Maulette]]. On 18 July 1594 in Paris, he signs the marriage contract between Suzanne Hotman and her first husband John Menteith, calling himself \"Gentleman of the Bedchamber of the King [and] Seigneur of Boullay-Thierry\".  In 1601 he was selected by the Duchess of [[Duchy of Lorraine|Lorraine]], sister of Henry IV, to take part with [[Daniel Tilenus]] and [[Pierre Du Moulin]] in a public disputation against [[Du Perron]] (afterwards cardinal), who had been charged with the task of converting her to the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nOn the accession of [[James I of England|James I]] to the English throne (1603), Gordon published in French and English a strongly Protestant [[panegyric]] of congratulation and, in the same year, a piece in Latin [[elegiac]]s addressed to Prince Henry.

In June 1565 he was sent to pursue his education in France, having a yearly pension granted him by [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], payable out of her French dowry.  He spent two years at the [[University of Paris|universities of Paris]] and Orleans.  On 4 January 1568 he was confirmed by royal charter in the bishopric of Galloway and [[Abbot of Tongland|abbacy]] of [[Tongland Abbey|Tongland]], vacated in his favour by his father; the charter specifies his skill in classical and oriental tongues.  At this time he was in France, in the service of the Protestant leader, Prince [[Louis I Conde|Louis of Conde]], but he soon came to England, entered the service of [[Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk|Thomas, Duke of Norfolk]], and attended him at the conferences of York (October 1568) and Westminster (November 1568), held for the purpose of considering Mary's guilt.\n\nWhen Norfolk was sent to the [[Tower of London|Tower]] (October 1569), Gordon transferred his services to Mary herself, and seems to have remained with her till January 1572, when she was deprived of her household.  Mary commended him to the French king, and he enjoyed the post of gentleman ordinary of the privy chamber to [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]], [[Henry III of France|Henry III]], and [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], with a yearly pension of four hundred crowns.  He saved the lives of several countrymen at the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]], but never renounced Protestantism.  In 1574 he exhibited his [[Hebrew]] learning in a public disputation at [[Avignon]] with the chief rabbi Benetrius.  By his marriage in  1576 with Antoinette, widowed daughter of [[Rene de Marolles]], he acquired an estate which gave him the style of \"Sieur of Longorme\".  With the [[see of Galloway]] his connection was never more than nominal, the revenues going to his father or to his brother George.\n\nGordon is mentioned in 1588 as Bishop of Galloway; but he resigned his rights before 8 July 1586.  His first wife died in 1591.  He married in 1594 a strong Protestant, [[Genevieve Petau de Maulette|Genevieve]], daughter of Fran\u00e7ois Petau, sieur of [[Maulette]]. On 18 July 1594 in Paris, he signs the marriage contract between Suzanne Hotman and her first husband John Menteith, calling himself \"Gentleman of the Bedchamber of the King [and] Seigneur of Boullay-Thierry\".  In 1601 he was selected by the Duchess of [[Duchy of Lorraine|Lorraine]], sister of Henry IV, to take part with [[Daniel Tilenus]] and [[Pierre Du Moulin]] in a public disputation against [[Du Perron]] (afterwards cardinal), who had been charged with the task of converting her to the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nOn the accession of [[James I of England|James I]] to the English throne (1603), Gordon published in French and English a strongly Protestant [[panegyric]] of congratulation and, in the same year, a piece in Latin [[elegiac]]s addressed to Prince Henry. James called him to England and nominated him in October to the deanery of Salisbury, whereupon he was ordained in his 59th year.  He was present at the [[Hampton Court conference]] in January 1604 as \"deane of Sarum\",' though he was not confirmed until 24 February.

RSF claims to be heirs of the [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] party founded in 1905 and took its present form in 1986 following a split in Sinn F\u00e9in. RSF members take seats when elected to local government in the [[Republic of Ireland]], but do not recognise the validity of the [[Partition of Ireland]]. It subsequently does not recognise the legitimacy of the parliaments of Northern Ireland ([[Stormont House|Stormont]]) or the Republic of Ireland ([[Leinster House]]), so the party does not register itself with them.\n\nThe party emerged around the supporters of [[Ruair\u00ed \u00d3 Br\u00e1daigh]] and [[D\u00e1ith\u00ed \u00d3 Conaill]]. As [[Irish republican legitimism|Irish republican legitimists]], they rejected the reformism of [[Gerry Adams]] and other members of Sinn F\u00e9in who supported abandoning the policy of [[abstentionism]]. They support the [[\u00c9ire Nua]] policy which allows for devolution of power to provincial governments. RSF holds that the [[Irish Republic (1916)|Irish Republic]] [[Proclamation of the Irish Republic|proclaimed in 1916]] continues to exist, and that the Continuity Irish Republican Army Council is its ''[[de jure]]'' government.<ref>[http://www.rsf.ie/page1.html Republican Sinn F\u00e9in] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130129081032/http://www.rsf.ie/page1.html |date=29 January 2013 }}. Retrieved 22 February 2013.</ref>\n\nThe organisation views itself as representing \"true\" or \"traditional\" [[Irish republicanism]], while in the mainstream media the organisation is portrayed as a political expression of \"[[dissident republicanism]]\". Republican Sinn F\u00e9in rejects the [[Good Friday Agreement]] and the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]]; as part of this they assert that Irish republicans have the [[Physical force Irish republicanism|right to use militant means]] to \"defend the Irish Republic\" and considers the [[Continuity Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) to be the legitimate army of the Irish Republic.\n\n==History==\n{{About||early history|History of Sinn F\u00e9in|}}\n\nThe modern origins of the party date from the mid 1980s. The decision to form, reorganise or reconstitute, as its supporters see it, the organisation was taken in response to [[Gerry Adams]]-led [[Sinn F\u00e9in]]'s decision at its 1986 ''[[ard fheis]]'' to end its policy of [[abstentionism]] and to allow elected Sinn F\u00e9in [[Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la]] (TDs) to take their seats in [[Leinster House]]'s [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/abstentionism/source.htm|title=CAIN: Issues: Abstentionism: Sinn Fein Ard Fheis 1-2 November 1986 - Details of Source Material|publisher=|accessdate=25 July 2015}}</ref> Those who went on to form RSF opposed this move as it signalled a departure from the traditional republican analysis, which viewed the D\u00e1il as an illegal assembly set up by an act of Westminster. They argued that republicans owed their allegiance to the [[Irish Republic]], maintaining that this state existed ''de jure'' and that its authority rested with the [[IRA Army Council]]. (See: [[Irish republican legitimatism]])\n\n{{Quote|\nWith regard to councils, Sinn F\u00e9in has always been in the councils and that is as near to the enemy system that we dare to go. Sitting in Leinster House is not a revolutionary activity. Once you go in there, once you sign the roll of the House and accept the institutions of the state, once you accept their rulings, you will not be able to do it according to your rules. You will have to go according to their rules and they can stand up and gang up on you and put you out on the street and keep you out on the street.\n\nAnd those in Leinster House, who have done everything; the firing-squads, the prison cells, the internment camps, the hunger strikes; the lot and weren't able to break this movement, that they can come and say \"At last, we have them toeing the line, it took us 65 years, but they have come in from the cold, they have come in from the wilderness and we have them now.\" Never!

In protest, they staged a walkout from the ardfheis and reconvened the ardfheis at another venue. RSF subsequently claimed that the delegates who had voted to drop abstentionism had in effect expelled themselves from the party. It is on this basis that RSF views itself as the only party entitled to the name of Sinn F\u00e9in and the sole legitimate successor to the original Sinn F\u00e9in established in 1905.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rsf.ie/100years.htm |title=Sinn F\u00e9in 100 years of unbroken continuity 1905-2005 |publisher=Rsf.ie |accessdate=2010-11-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726142448/http://rsf.ie/100years.htm |archive-date=26 July 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>  Supporters of abstentionism also claimed that the vote at the ardfheis was gerrymandered. Journalist Ed Moloney, for example, points out that in 1986 the number of votes at the ardfheis, which reflects the size of Sinn F\u00e9in, almost doubled from 1985 to 1986, and then reverted to the 1985 level in 1987.<ref name=Moloneyp296>{{cite book | last = Moloney | first = Ed | title = A Secret History of the IRA | year = 2003 | page = 296 | isbn = 0-14-101041-X}}</ref>\n\nAdams-led Provisional Sinn F\u00e9in argued that a previous ''ardfheis'' in 1983 amended the constitution so that \"no aspect of the constitution and rules be closed to discussion\".

RSF rejects the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] of 1921 which led to the creation of the [[Irish Free State]] and [[Northern Ireland]] as an act of treason and refer to it as the \"Treaty of Surrender.\" The regime sitting in [[Leinster House]] is regarded by RSF as being founded as an illegitimate British-puppet state (and latterly a fiefdom of Brussels) analogous to [[Vichy France]] during [[World War II]] and the assembly at [[Stormont House]] as a more overt manifestation of \"occupation.\" It quotes [[Wolfe Tone]] who said of an urgent need to \"break the connection with England, the never-failing source of all our political evils\" in calling for the \"complete overthrow of British rule in Ireland\".\n\nIt also refuses to recognise the validity of the [[Good Friday Agreement]] as it argues that the referendum on the agreement did not offer the people of Ireland the choice of living in a united Ireland, and that the referendum was invalid since separate polls were held in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.<ref name=\"rsf\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rsf.ie/motion99.htm |title=Republican Sinn F\u00e9in ardfheis / National Conference 1999 |publisher=Rsf.ie |date=2000-01-01 |accessdate=2010-11-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206014850/http://www.rsf.ie/motion99.htm |archive-date=6 February 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> It also opposes the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] as it believes that this further entrenches British presence in Ireland, and that \"those nationalists who took their seats in the new Stormont\" were \"guilty of treachery to the Irish Republic\".\n\nRepublican Sinn F\u00e9in does not consider the [[Defence Forces (Ireland)|Defence Forces]] (descended from the pro-Treaty [[National Army (Ireland)|National Army]] of the [[Irish Civil War]]) to be the armed forces of the Irish Republic, rather it claims that the Irish Republican Army is the only organisation that has the right to the title of the ''[[\u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann]]''. This includes in succession; the [[Irish Republican Army (1917\u201322)]], the [[Irish Republican Army (1922\u201369)]], the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (1969\u201386) and since then the [[Continuity Irish Republican Army]]. These organisations are all considered by it to simply be the one Irish Republican Army founded by the merger of the [[Irish Volunteers]] and the [[Irish Citizen Army]].\n\n===Foreign affairs===\nRepublican Sinn F\u00e9in maintains that Ireland should remain independent of large power blocks and thus is a [[Eurosceptic]] party. The people who would go on to found RSF, while they were still members of Provisional Sinn F\u00e9in in 1972 opposed Ireland being brought into the [[European Economic Community]], which later became the [[European Union]]. RSF in any case does not recognise the [[Single European Act]], [[Maastricht Treaty]], [[Amsterdam Treaty]], [[Treaty of Nice]] and [[Treaty of Lisbon]] as it applies to Ireland, because these agreements were ratified by what it sees as completely \"illegitimate\" regimes at Leinster House in [[Dublin]] and (for the north) [[Westminster Palace]] in [[London]].\n\nIn a more general sense, it says there is a \"danger of the growing European Union becoming a world superpower in its own right\" and that it could be a participant in potential \"resource wars\" of the 21st century, something it says Ireland cannot support as it would end up \"swapping British domination for European domination\". It further criticised the EU as taking a \"highly centralised political and economic power-bloc\" whose decision making is made in what they termed \"completely undemocratic institutions\"; and that EU bureaucrats work against the interest of small farmers and restructure industry so that the EU centre can prosper at Ireland's expense. Amongst all these issues it said that Ireland's neutrality is under threat.\n\nRSF says that because of [[History of Ireland|Ireland's history]] as a \"colonial possession\" it supports other national liberation struggles around the world and \"feel[s] a sense of solidarity with all peoples who are struggling for freedom and justice\".  The party calls itself \"[[internationalism (politics)|internationalist]]\" as it says it recognises that \"we all have a common identity as human beings, as members of the great family of peoples [and] we wish to play our role in this wider world community on the basis of equality and respect for the rights of others\". In that vein, it supports [[debt relief]] for [[Third World|developing countries]]. It also advocates Ireland's neutrality in avoiding military alliances and power blocs.\n\n===Cultural policy===\nOther policies of the RSF include the [[separation of church and state]] and the importance of the [[Irish language]] \"to the Irish [[National identity|identity]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsf.ie/page1.html|title=About|accessdate=25 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924092350/http://www.rsf.ie/page1.html|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It is also [[abstentionist]] as both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland were created by acts of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] against what it called the \"wishes of the Irish people\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsf.ie/intro.htm|title=Introduction|accessdate=25 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924092349/http://www.rsf.ie/intro.htm|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Social policy===\nIt stands on a platform of the establishment of social justice based on what it describes as the principles of Irish Republican [[Socialism]], based on the 1916 [[proclamation of the Irish Republic|proclamation of an Irish Republic]].

RSF strenuously rejects the allegation that it is the \"political wing\" of the Continuity IRA, as it denies any assertion that the latter is its \"military wing\".\n\n===Position of foreign governments===\nSome foreign governments in the [[Anglosphere]] have taken a public position against Republican Sinn F\u00e9in; the [[United States State Department]] lists the party as a \"[[U.S. State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations|terrorist organisation]]\" along with the Continuity IRA. The State Department states that the CIRA \"is a terrorist splinter group formed in 1994 as the clandestine armed wing of Republican Sinn F\u00e9in, which split from Sinn F\u00e9in in 1986. 'Continuity' refers to the group's belief that it is carrying on the original Irish Republican Army's (IRA) policy of being the army of the [[Irish Republic]].

RSF claims to be heirs of the [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] party founded in 1905 and took its present form in 1986 following a split in Sinn F\u00e9in. RSF members take seats when elected to local government in the [[Republic of Ireland]], but do not recognise the validity of the [[Partition of Ireland]]. It subsequently does not recognise the legitimacy of the parliaments of Northern Ireland ([[Stormont House|Stormont]]) or the Republic of Ireland ([[Leinster House]]), so the party does not register itself with them.\n\nThe party emerged around the supporters of [[Ruair\u00ed \u00d3 Br\u00e1daigh]] and [[D\u00e1ith\u00ed \u00d3 Conaill]]. As [[Irish republican legitimism|Irish republican legitimists]], they rejected the reformism of [[Gerry Adams]] and other members of Sinn F\u00e9in who supported abandoning the policy of [[abstentionism]]. They support the [[\u00c9ire Nua]] policy which allows for devolution of power to provincial governments. RSF holds that the [[Irish Republic (1916)|Irish Republic]] [[Proclamation of the Irish Republic|proclaimed in 1916]] continues to exist, and that the Continuity Irish Republican Army Council is its ''[[de jure]]'' government.<ref>[http://www.rsf.ie/page1.html Republican Sinn F\u00e9in] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130129081032/http://www.rsf.ie/page1.html |date=29 January 2013 }}.

Republican Sinn F\u00e9in rejects the [[Good Friday Agreement]] and the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]]; as part of this they assert that Irish republicans have the [[Physical force Irish republicanism|right to use militant means]] to \"defend the Irish Republic\" and considers the [[Continuity Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) to be the legitimate army of the Irish Republic.\n\n==History==\n{{About||early history|History of Sinn F\u00e9in|}}\n\nThe modern origins of the party date from the mid 1980s. The decision to form, reorganise or reconstitute, as its supporters see it, the organisation was taken in response to [[Gerry Adams]]-led [[Sinn F\u00e9in]]'s decision at its 1986 ''[[ard fheis]]'' to end its policy of [[abstentionism]] and to allow elected Sinn F\u00e9in [[Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la]] (TDs) to take their seats in [[Leinster House]]'s [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/abstentionism/source.htm|title=CAIN: Issues: Abstentionism: Sinn Fein Ard Fheis 1-2 November 1986 - Details of Source Material|publisher=|accessdate=25 July 2015}}</ref> Those who went on to form RSF opposed this move as it signalled a departure from the traditional republican analysis, which viewed the D\u00e1il as an illegal assembly set up by an act of Westminster. They argued that republicans owed their allegiance to the [[Irish Republic]], maintaining that this state existed ''de jure'' and that its authority rested with the [[IRA Army Council]]. (See: [[Irish republican legitimatism]])\n\n{{Quote|\nWith regard to councils, Sinn F\u00e9in has always been in the councils and that is as near to the enemy system that we dare to go. Sitting in Leinster House is not a revolutionary activity. Once you go in there, once you sign the roll of the House and accept the institutions of the state, once you accept their rulings, you will not be able to do it according to your rules. You will have to go according to their rules and they can stand up and gang up on you and put you out on the street and keep you out on the street.\n\nAnd those in Leinster House, who have done everything; the firing-squads, the prison cells, the internment camps, the hunger strikes; the lot and weren't able to break this movement, that they can come and say \"At last, we have them toeing the line, it took us 65 years, but they have come in from the cold, they have come in from the wilderness and we have them now.\" Never!

In protest, they staged a walkout from the ardfheis and reconvened the ardfheis at another venue. RSF subsequently claimed that the delegates who had voted to drop abstentionism had in effect expelled themselves from the party. It is on this basis that RSF views itself as the only party entitled to the name of Sinn F\u00e9in and the sole legitimate successor to the original Sinn F\u00e9in established in 1905.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rsf.ie/100years.htm |title=Sinn F\u00e9in 100 years of unbroken continuity 1905-2005 |publisher=Rsf.ie |accessdate=2010-11-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726142448/http://rsf.ie/100years.htm |archive-date=26 July 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>  Supporters of abstentionism also claimed that the vote at the ardfheis was gerrymandered. Journalist Ed Moloney, for example, points out that in 1986 the number of votes at the ardfheis, which reflects the size of Sinn F\u00e9in, almost doubled from 1985 to 1986, and then reverted to the 1985 level in 1987.<ref name=Moloneyp296>{{cite book | last = Moloney | first = Ed | title = A Secret History of the IRA | year = 2003 | page = 296 | isbn = 0-14-101041-X}}</ref>\n\nAdams-led Provisional Sinn F\u00e9in argued that a previous ''ardfheis'' in 1983 amended the constitution so that \"no aspect of the constitution and rules be closed to discussion\".

RSF rejects the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] of 1921 which led to the creation of the [[Irish Free State]] and [[Northern Ireland]] as an act of treason and refer to it as the \"Treaty of Surrender.\" The regime sitting in [[Leinster House]] is regarded by RSF as being founded as an illegitimate British-puppet state (and latterly a fiefdom of Brussels) analogous to [[Vichy France]] during [[World War II]] and the assembly at [[Stormont House]] as a more overt manifestation of \"occupation.\" It quotes [[Wolfe Tone]] who said of an urgent need to \"break the connection with England, the never-failing source of all our political evils\" in calling for the \"complete overthrow of British rule in Ireland\".\n\nIt also refuses to recognise the validity of the [[Good Friday Agreement]] as it argues that the referendum on the agreement did not offer the people of Ireland the choice of living in a united Ireland, and that the referendum was invalid since separate polls were held in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.<ref name=\"rsf\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rsf.ie/motion99.htm |title=Republican Sinn F\u00e9in ardfheis / National Conference 1999 |publisher=Rsf.ie |date=2000-01-01 |accessdate=2010-11-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206014850/http://www.rsf.ie/motion99.htm |archive-date=6 February 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> It also opposes the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] as it believes that this further entrenches British presence in Ireland, and that \"those nationalists who took their seats in the new Stormont\" were \"guilty of treachery to the Irish Republic\".\n\nRepublican Sinn F\u00e9in does not consider the [[Defence Forces (Ireland)|Defence Forces]] (descended from the pro-Treaty [[National Army (Ireland)|National Army]] of the [[Irish Civil War]]) to be the armed forces of the Irish Republic, rather it claims that the Irish Republican Army is the only organisation that has the right to the title of the ''[[\u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann]]''. This includes in succession; the [[Irish Republican Army (1917\u201322)]], the [[Irish Republican Army (1922\u201369)]], the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (1969\u201386) and since then the [[Continuity Irish Republican Army]]. These organisations are all considered by it to simply be the one Irish Republican Army founded by the merger of the [[Irish Volunteers]] and the [[Irish Citizen Army]].\n\n===Foreign affairs===\nRepublican Sinn F\u00e9in maintains that Ireland should remain independent of large power blocks and thus is a [[Eurosceptic]] party. The people who would go on to found RSF, while they were still members of Provisional Sinn F\u00e9in in 1972 opposed Ireland being brought into the [[European Economic Community]], which later became the [[European Union]]. RSF in any case does not recognise the [[Single European Act]], [[Maastricht Treaty]], [[Amsterdam Treaty]], [[Treaty of Nice]] and [[Treaty of Lisbon]] as it applies to Ireland, because these agreements were ratified by what it sees as completely \"illegitimate\" regimes at Leinster House in [[Dublin]] and (for the north) [[Westminster Palace]] in [[London]].\n\nIn a more general sense, it says there is a \"danger of the growing European Union becoming a world superpower in its own right\" and that it could be a participant in potential \"resource wars\" of the 21st century, something it says Ireland cannot support as it would end up \"swapping British domination for European domination\". It further criticised the EU as taking a \"highly centralised political and economic power-bloc\" whose decision making is made in what they termed \"completely undemocratic institutions\"; and that EU bureaucrats work against the interest of small farmers and restructure industry so that the EU centre can prosper at Ireland's expense. Amongst all these issues it said that Ireland's neutrality is under threat.\n\nRSF says that because of [[History of Ireland|Ireland's history]] as a \"colonial possession\" it supports other national liberation struggles around the world and \"feel[s] a sense of solidarity with all peoples who are struggling for freedom and justice\".  The party calls itself \"[[internationalism (politics)|internationalist]]\" as it says it recognises that \"we all have a common identity as human beings, as members of the great family of peoples [and] we wish to play our role in this wider world community on the basis of equality and respect for the rights of others\". In that vein, it supports [[debt relief]] for [[Third World|developing countries]]. It also advocates Ireland's neutrality in avoiding military alliances and power blocs.\n\n===Cultural policy===\nOther policies of the RSF include the [[separation of church and state]] and the importance of the [[Irish language]] \"to the Irish [[National identity|identity]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsf.ie/page1.html|title=About|accessdate=25 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924092350/http://www.rsf.ie/page1.html|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It is also [[abstentionist]] as both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland were created by acts of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] against what it called the \"wishes of the Irish people\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsf.ie/intro.htm|title=Introduction|accessdate=25 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924092349/http://www.rsf.ie/intro.htm|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Social policy===\nIt stands on a platform of the establishment of social justice based on what it describes as the principles of Irish Republican [[Socialism]], based on the 1916 [[proclamation of the Irish Republic|proclamation of an Irish Republic]].

As a consequence of this dispute, a number of people resigned from RSF and formed the [[Concerned Group for Republican Prisoners]] to raise funds and provide moral support for the former Continuity IRA-aligned prisoners they supported. However a majority of the prisoners chose to return and the organisation as of 2011 is defunct.\n\nIn August 2010 it was reported that members of the Limerick cumann were expelled, and had first adopted the name Limerick Independent Republican Organisation, before changing it to Real Sinn F\u00e9in, then simply Republican Sinn F\u00e9in, and finally Continuity Sinn F\u00e9in.<ref>''Saoirse'', August 2010</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.continuitysinnfein.org/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=12 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222074956/http://www.continuitysinnfein.org/ |archive-date=22 December 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In the following years two opposing groups in Limerick, one loyal to local man Joe Lynch, the other loyal to the leadership in Dublin under Des Dalton, claimed to be the \"real\" Republican Sinn F\u00e9in.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.limerickleader.ie/news/leader-local/dissidents-in-limerick-at-war-over-army-threats-1-4657762 | title=Dissidents in Limerick at War | work=News | date=8 January 2013 | agency=Limerick Leader | accessdate=2013-04-13 | author=Hurley, David}}</ref>\n\n==Relationship to other republican organisations==\n\nRSF sees itself as forming part of a wider [[Republican Movement (Ireland)|Republican Movement]] with a number of organisations which share a similar or identical ideological and political perspective. These include (but are not limited to) the [[Continuity IRA]], [[Cumann na mBan]], [[Fianna \u00c9ireann]], [[Cabhair]] and the [[National Commemoration Committee]] and the Republican Prisoners Action Group.{{cn|date=February 2020}} Across these organisations there is believed to be some level of dual membership with RSF. RSF strenuously rejects the allegation that it is the \"political wing\" of the Continuity IRA, as it denies any assertion that the latter is its \"military wing\".\n\n===Position of foreign governments===\nSome foreign governments in the [[Anglosphere]] have taken a public position against Republican Sinn F\u00e9in; the [[United States State Department]] lists the party as a \"[[U.S. State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations|terrorist organisation]]\" along with the Continuity IRA. The State Department states that the CIRA \"is a terrorist splinter group formed in 1994 as the clandestine armed wing of Republican Sinn F\u00e9in, which split from Sinn F\u00e9in in 1986. 'Continuity' refers to the group's belief that it is carrying on the original Irish Republican Army's (IRA) policy of being the army of the [[Irish Republic]]. CIRA's alleged aliases, Continuity Army Council and Republican Sinn F\u00e9in, were also designated as FTOs.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/45323.pdf |title=Country Reports on Terrorism: Chapter 6 Terrorist Groups |publisher=State.gov | page=97|accessdate=2013-02-22}}</ref> The British government currently lists the Continuity Army Council and the Irish Republican Army as a \"terrorist group\" under the ''[[Terrorism Act 2000]],'' but does not mention Republican Sinn F\u00e9in.\n\n==Electoral participation==\n[[Image:Dankeating.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Irish War of Independence veteran and RSF Patron [[Dan Keating]]]]\nThough the RSF's policy of abstentionism means that it would not take seats in [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]], the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] or the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|British House of Commons]], if elected, it has contested local elections in the Republic and Assembly elections in Northern Ireland in 2007.\n\n===First elections===\nIt initially planned to field 23 candidates, including three sitting councillors elected for Sinn F\u00e9in in 1985, in the 1989 local government elections in Northern Ireland.

The voyage lasted more than nine months and resulted in 169 cases of sickness and 25 deaths on a ship of 376 men. With the support of the Japanese Navy, he conducted an experiment in which another ship was deployed on the same route, except that its crew was fed a diet of meat, fish, barley, rice, and beans. At the end of the voyage, this crew had only 14 cases of beriberi and no deaths. This convinced Takaki and the Japanese Navy that diet was the cause.<ref name=Takaki/> In 1884, Takaki observed that beriberi was common among low-ranking crew who were often provided free rice and thus ate little else, but not among crews of Western navies, nor among Japanese officers who consumed a more varied diet.\n\nIn 1897, [[Christiaan Eijkman]], a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[physician]] and [[pathologist]], demonstrated that beriberi is caused by poor diet, and discovered that feeding unpolished rice (instead of the polished variety) to chickens helped to prevent beriberi. The following year, Sir [[Frederick Hopkins]] postulated that some foods contained \"accessory factors\"\u2014in addition to proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and salt\u2014that were necessary for the functions of the human body.<ref name=\"Challem\">{{cite web | first = Jack | last = Challem | year = 1997 | url = http://www.thenutritionreporter.com/history_of_vitamins.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100608223713/http://www.thenutritionreporter.com/history_of_vitamins.html | archivedate = 8 June 2010 | title = The Past, Present and Future of Vitamins}}{{MEDRS|date=July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{citation | url = http://nobelprize.org/educational_games/medicine/vitamin_b1/eijkman.html | title = Christiaan Eijkman, Beriberi and Vitamin B1 | publisher = Nobelprize.org, Nobel Media AB | accessdate = 8 July 2013 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100117191212/http://nobelprize.org/educational_games/medicine/vitamin_b1/eijkman.html | archivedate = 17 January 2010 }}</ref> In 1901, [[Gerrit Grijns]], a Dutch physician and assistant to [[Christiaan Eijkman]] in the Netherlands, correctly interpreted beriberi as a deficiency syndrome,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Grijns |first1=G. |year=1901 |title=Over polyneuritis gallinarum |journal=Geneeskundig Tijdschrift voor Nederlandsch-Indie |volume=43 |pages=3\u2013110}}</ref> and between 1910 and 1913, [[Edward Bright Vedder]] established that an extract of [[rice bran]] is a treatment for beriberi.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} In 1929, Eijkman and Hopkins were awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine]] for their discoveries.\n\n===Etymology===\nAlthough according to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], the term \"beriberi\" comes from a [[Sinhala language|Sinhalese]] phrase meaning \"weak, weak\" or \"I cannot, I cannot\", the word being [[reduplication|duplicated]] for emphasis,<ref>[[Oxford English Dictionary]]: \"Beri-beri&nbsp;... a Cingalese word, f. ''beri'' weakness, the reduplication being intensive&nbsp;...\", page 203, 1937</ref> the origin of the phrase is questionable. It has also been suggested to come from Hindi, Arabic and a few other languages, with many meanings like \"weakness\", \"sailor\" and even \"sheep\". Such suggested origins were listed by [[Heinrich Botho Scheube]] among others. [[Edward Vedder]] wrote in his book ''Beriberi'' (1913) that \"it is impossible to definitely trace the origin of the word beriberi\". Word ''berbere'' was used in writing at least as early as 1568 by [[Diogo do Couto]], when he described the deficiency in India.<ref>HA Smith, p. 118-119</ref>\n\n\"Kakke\", which is a Japanese synonym for thiamine deficiency, comes from the way \"jiao qi\" is pronounced in Japanese.<ref name=\":2\">HA Smith, p. 149</ref> \"Jiao qi\" is an old word used in Chinese medicine to describe beriberi.<ref name=\":0\" /> \"Kakke\" is supposed to have entered into the Japanese language sometime between the 6th and 8th centuries.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Other animals==\n\n===Poultry===\nAs most feedstuffs used in poultry diets contain enough quantities of vitamins to meet the requirements in this species, deficiencies in this vitamin do not occur with commercial diets. This was, at least, the opinion in the 1960s.<ref>''Merck Veterinary Manual'', ed 1967, pp 1440-1441.</ref>\n\nMature chickens show signs three weeks after being fed a deficient diet. In young chicks, it can appear before two weeks of age.\n\nOnset is sudden in young chicks. There is anorexia and an unsteady gait. Later on, there are locomotor signs, beginning with an apparent paralysis of the flexor of the toes. The characteristic position is called \"stargazing\", meaning a chick \"sitting on its hocks and the head in [[opisthotonos]]\".\n\nResponse to administration of the vitamin is rather quick, occurring a few hours later.<ref>R.E. Austic and M.L. Scott, Nutritional deficiency diseases, in ''Diseases of poultry'', ed. by M.S.

In riboflavin deficiency, the \"curled toes\" is a characteristic symptom. Muscle tremor is typical of avian encephalomyelitis. A therapeutic [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] can be tried by supplementing thiamine only in the affected bird. If the animals do not respond in a few hours, thiamine deficiency can be excluded.\n\n===Ruminants===\n[[Polioencephalomalacia]] (PEM) is the most common thiamine deficiency disorder in young ruminant and nonruminant animals.  Symptoms of PEM include a profuse, but transient, diarrhea, listlessness, circling movements, star gazing or opisthotonus (head drawn back over neck), and muscle tremors.<ref>National Research Council. 1996. ''Nutrient Requirements of Beef Cattle'', Seventh Revised Ed. Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press.</ref> The most common cause is high-carbohydrate feeds, leading to the overgrowth of thiaminase-producing bacteria, but dietary ingestion of thiaminase (e.g., in [[bracken]] fern), or inhibition of thiamine absorption by high sulfur intake are also possible.<ref>[http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/102000.htm Polioencephalomalacia: Introduction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303233122/http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm%2Fbc%2F102000.htm |date=2016-03-03 }}, ''Merck Veterinary Manual''</ref>  Another cause of PEM is ''Clostridium sporogenes'' or ''Bacillus aneurinolyticus'' infection.

beriberi include weight loss, [[emotion]]al disturbances, impaired [[sensory perception]], [[muscle weakness|weakness]] and [[pain]] in the limbs, and periods of irregular [[heart rate]]. [[Edema]] (swelling of bodily tissues) is common. It may increase the amount of [[lactic acid]] and [[pyruvic acid]] within the blood. In advanced cases, the disease may cause [[high-output cardiac failure]] and death.\n\nSymptoms may occur concurrently with those of [[Wernicke's encephalopathy]], a primarily neurological thiamine-deficiency related condition.\n\nBeriberi is divided into four categories as follows.

Hong called the illness by the name ''jiao qi'', which can be interpreted as \"foot [[qi]]\". He described the symptoms to include swelling, weakness and numbness of the feet. He also acknowledged that the illness could be deadly, and claimed that it could be cured by eating certain foods such as fermented soybeans in wine. Better known examples of early descriptions of \"foot qi\" are by [[Chao Yuanfang]] (who lived during 550\u2013630) in his book ''Zhu bing yuan hou lun'' (Sources and Symptoms of All Diseases)<ref name=\":0\">HA Smith, p. 26-28</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Benedict|first=CA|date=2018-10-25|title=Forgotten Disease: Illnesses Transformed in Chinese Medicine by Hilary A.

The voyage lasted more than nine months and resulted in 169 cases of sickness and 25 deaths on a ship of 376 men. With the support of the Japanese Navy, he conducted an experiment in which another ship was deployed on the same route, except that its crew was fed a diet of meat, fish, barley, rice, and beans. At the end of the voyage, this crew had only 14 cases of beriberi and no deaths. This convinced Takaki and the Japanese Navy that diet was the cause.<ref name=Takaki/> In 1884, Takaki observed that beriberi was common among low-ranking crew who were often provided free rice and thus ate little else, but not among crews of Western navies, nor among Japanese officers who consumed a more varied diet.\n\nIn 1897, [[Christiaan Eijkman]], a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[physician]] and [[pathologist]], demonstrated that beriberi is caused by poor diet, and discovered that feeding unpolished rice (instead of the polished variety) to chickens helped to prevent beriberi. The following year, Sir [[Frederick Hopkins]] postulated that some foods contained \"accessory factors\"\u2014in addition to proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and salt\u2014that were necessary for the functions of the human body.<ref name=\"Challem\">{{cite web | first = Jack | last = Challem | year = 1997 | url = http://www.thenutritionreporter.com/history_of_vitamins.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100608223713/http://www.thenutritionreporter.com/history_of_vitamins.html | archivedate = 8 June 2010 | title = The Past, Present and Future of Vitamins}}{{MEDRS|date=July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{citation | url = http://nobelprize.org/educational_games/medicine/vitamin_b1/eijkman.html | title = Christiaan Eijkman, Beriberi and Vitamin B1 | publisher = Nobelprize.org, Nobel Media AB | accessdate = 8 July 2013 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100117191212/http://nobelprize.org/educational_games/medicine/vitamin_b1/eijkman.html | archivedate = 17 January 2010 }}</ref> In 1901, [[Gerrit Grijns]], a Dutch physician and assistant to [[Christiaan Eijkman]] in the Netherlands, correctly interpreted beriberi as a deficiency syndrome,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Grijns |first1=G. |year=1901 |title=Over polyneuritis gallinarum |journal=Geneeskundig Tijdschrift voor Nederlandsch-Indie |volume=43 |pages=3\u2013110}}</ref> and between 1910 and 1913, [[Edward Bright Vedder]] established that an extract of [[rice bran]] is a treatment for beriberi.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} In 1929, Eijkman and Hopkins were awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine]] for their discoveries.\n\n===Etymology===\nAlthough according to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], the term \"beriberi\" comes from a [[Sinhala language|Sinhalese]] phrase meaning \"weak, weak\" or \"I cannot, I cannot\", the word being [[reduplication|duplicated]] for emphasis,<ref>[[Oxford English Dictionary]]: \"Beri-beri&nbsp;... a Cingalese word, f. ''beri'' weakness, the reduplication being intensive&nbsp;...\", page 203, 1937</ref> the origin of the phrase is questionable. It has also been suggested to come from Hindi, Arabic and a few other languages, with many meanings like \"weakness\", \"sailor\" and even \"sheep\". Such suggested origins were listed by [[Heinrich Botho Scheube]] among others. [[Edward Vedder]] wrote in his book ''Beriberi'' (1913) that \"it is impossible to definitely trace the origin of the word beriberi\". Word ''berbere'' was used in writing at least as early as 1568 by [[Diogo do Couto]], when he described the deficiency in India.<ref>HA Smith, p. 118-119</ref>\n\n\"Kakke\", which is a Japanese synonym for thiamine deficiency, comes from the way \"jiao qi\" is pronounced in Japanese.<ref name=\":2\">HA Smith, p. 149</ref> \"Jiao qi\" is an old word used in Chinese medicine to describe beriberi.<ref name=\":0\" /> \"Kakke\" is supposed to have entered into the Japanese language sometime between the 6th and 8th centuries.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Other animals==\n\n===Poultry===\nAs most feedstuffs used in poultry diets contain enough quantities of vitamins to meet the requirements in this species, deficiencies in this vitamin do not occur with commercial diets. This was, at least, the opinion in the 1960s.<ref>''Merck Veterinary Manual'', ed 1967, pp 1440-1441.</ref>\n\nMature chickens show signs three weeks after being fed a deficient diet. In young chicks, it can appear before two weeks of age.\n\nOnset is sudden in young chicks. There is anorexia and an unsteady gait. Later on, there are locomotor signs, beginning with an apparent paralysis of the flexor of the toes. The characteristic position is called \"stargazing\", meaning a chick \"sitting on its hocks and the head in [[opisthotonos]]\".\n\nResponse to administration of the vitamin is rather quick, occurring a few hours later.<ref>R.E. Austic and M.L. Scott, Nutritional deficiency diseases, in ''Diseases of poultry'', ed. by M.S.

In riboflavin deficiency, the \"curled toes\" is a characteristic symptom. Muscle tremor is typical of avian encephalomyelitis. A therapeutic [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] can be tried by supplementing thiamine only in the affected bird. If the animals do not respond in a few hours, thiamine deficiency can be excluded.\n\n===Ruminants===\n[[Polioencephalomalacia]] (PEM) is the most common thiamine deficiency disorder in young ruminant and nonruminant animals.  Symptoms of PEM include a profuse, but transient, diarrhea, listlessness, circling movements, star gazing or opisthotonus (head drawn back over neck), and muscle tremors.<ref>National Research Council. 1996. ''Nutrient Requirements of Beef Cattle'', Seventh Revised Ed. Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press.</ref>  The most common cause is high-carbohydrate feeds, leading to the overgrowth of thiaminase-producing bacteria, but dietary ingestion of thiaminase (e.g., in [[bracken]] fern), or inhibition of thiamine absorption by high sulfur intake are also possible.<ref>[http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/102000.htm Polioencephalomalacia: Introduction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303233122/http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm%2Fbc%2F102000.htm |date=2016-03-03 }}, ''Merck Veterinary Manual''</ref>  Another cause of PEM is ''Clostridium sporogenes'' or ''Bacillus aneurinolyticus'' infection.
