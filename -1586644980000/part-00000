''[[Screen Daily]]'', 10 September 2019.</ref> It was released on the streaming service on 20 March 2020.\n\n==Plot==\nGoreng awakes in a concrete cell marked with the number 48. His roommate, Trimagasi, explains that they are in a tower-style facility in which food is delivered via a platform that travels from the top, stopping for a fixed period on each floor. Those on lower levels are able to eat only what those at the top leave them, and they cannot hoard food (the cell is heated or cooled to fatal levels if food is kept). Every month, people are randomly reassigned to a new level. Each resident is allowed to bring one item in with them, Goreng choosing a copy of ''[[Don Quixote]]'', and Trimagasi a self-sharpening knife. \n\nOne day, a bloodied woman named Miharu rides down on the platform, and Trimagasi explains that she descends the pit every month in search of her child. Goreng sees her being attacked by the two people on the level below, and he considers jumping down to help her, but she kills them both and rides the platform down again.\n\nAs they talk, it is revealed that Goreng volunteered to spend six months in the \"Vertical Self-Management Center\" in exchange for a diploma, and Trimagasi is serving a year-long sentence for manslaughter. Over the month, they become friendly, but on the day of the room shuffle, Goreng wakes up tied to the bed. They have been reassigned to level 171, where the platform is expected to be empty of food when it arrives. Trimagasi explains that he plans to cut strips of Goreng's flesh to sustain them both. On the eighth day, Trimagasi cuts into Goreng's leg but is attacked by Miharu as she comes down the platform. She frees Goreng and he kills Trimagasi. Miharu cuts some of Trimagasi's flesh, feeding Goreng and eating some herself before continuing down. \n\nThe following month, Goreng awakes on level 33 with a woman, Imoguiri, as a cellmate. The only thing she brought with her was her dog. Goreng recognizes her as the Administration official who interviewed him before sending him to the cells. She tells Goreng that she believes there are 200 floors. She says she was unaware of the horrible conditions and volunteered to try to fix things when she was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Imoguiri rations her food and attempts to convince those below to do so as well, but they ignore her until Goreng threatens to defecate in their food.\n\nGoreng encounters Miharu once again as she rides down on the platform but she appears critically injured, presumably from being in a fight on the higher levels. Goreng and Imoguiri grab her off the platform and tend to her wounds. Goreng explains to Imoguiri about Miharu's search for her child, but Imoguiri says nobody under the age of 16 is allowed into the facility and says Miharu entered alone. \n\nGoreng awakens to see Miharu and Imoguiri in a standoff, as Miharu has eaten Imoguiri's dog.  Goreng awakens the following month on level 202 and finds that Imoguiri has hanged herself. Goreng eats her flesh to survive, experiencing hallucinations of her and Trimagasi instructing him to do so. He then awakens the following month on level 6. His roommate, Baharat, attempts to climb up  through the upper level with the help of those above using a rope he brought into the pit. The couple living first help him, but end up defecating in his face, and pushing him back down. Estimating that there are around 250 levels, Goreng makes a plan to ride the platform down, rationing the food so all get a share, and convinces Baharat to go with him.\n\nAs they descend, they hand out portions to the prisoners, attacking those who refuse to cooperate. Going down, they encounter Miharu fighting two other residents and try to help her, but she is killed, and both men are injured. Goreng and Baharat continue to descend, eventually passing level 250 and reaching level 333 where the platform stops. Goreng notices a child hiding under the bed, and assumes it is Miharu's son. He gets off the platform, followed hesitantly by Baharat, only to have the platform continue downward, leaving them behind. They then discover the child is actually a girl, who turns out to be Miharu's  daughter. Despite Baharat's reluctance, they feed her an untouched [[panna cotta]] they had been saving as a \"message\" for the Administrators at the top. \n\nGoreng passes out and dreams of Baharat telling him that \"the girl is the message.\" The next day, Goreng finds Baharat dead after succumbing to his injuries, and takes the child with him when the platform arrives; they descend to the bottom of the pit where he once again sees Trimagasi, who tells him that \"the message requires no bearer.\" Goreng gets off the platform and walks away with Trimagasi, both turning to watch as the girl is transported upwards.\n\n== Cast==\n[[File:El hoyo prentsaurrekoa rueda de prensa.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cast and crew members at a press conference.]]\n* [[Iv\u00e1n Massagu\u00e9]] as ''Goreng'', named after ''[[:wiktionary:goreng|gor\u00e8ng]]'', which means \"fried\" in Malay/Indonesian.\n* Zorion Eguileor ([[:eu:Zorion_Egileor|eu]]) as ''Trimagasi'', named after terima kasih, which stands for \"thank you\" in Malay/Indonesian language\n* [[Antonia San Juan]] as ''Imoguiri'', named after ''[[Imogiri]]'', a royal graveyard in Indonesia. \n* [[Emilio Buale Coka]] as ''Baharat'', named after ''[[baharat]]'', a spice blend used in Turkish and Greek cuisine.\n* Alexandra Masangkay as ''Miharu'' \n* Eric L.

It is a system bound to cause conflict, as inmates at the top levels can eat as much as they can, leaving increasingly little for those below.<ref name=nicholson/>\n\nThe film's cast includes [[Iv\u00e1n Massagu\u00e9]], [[Antonia San Juan]], Zorion Eguileor, [[Emilio Buale Coka]] and Alexandra Masangkay.<ref name=nicholson/>\n\nThe film premiered at the [[2019 Toronto International Film Festival]], where it won the [[Toronto International Film Festival People's Choice Award: Midnight Madness|People's Choice Award for Midnight Madness]].<ref>Jessica Wong, [https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/tiff19-awards-1.5284085 \"TIFF 2019: Jojo Rabbit captures TIFF People's Choice Award\"].

''[[Screen Daily]]'', 10 September 2019.</ref> It was released on the streaming service on 20 March 2020.\n\n==Plot==\nGoreng awakes in a concrete cell marked with the number 48. His roommate, Trimagasi, explains that they are in a tower-style facility in which food is delivered via a platform that travels from the top, stopping for a fixed period on each floor. Those on lower levels are able to eat only what those at the top leave them, and they cannot hoard food (the cell is heated or cooled to fatal levels if food is kept). Every month, people are randomly reassigned to a new level. Each resident is allowed to bring one item in with them, Goreng choosing a copy of ''[[Don Quixote]]'', and Trimagasi a self-sharpening knife. \n\nOne day, a bloodied woman named Miharu rides down on the platform, and Trimagasi explains that she descends the pit every month in search of her child. Goreng sees her being attacked by the two people on the level below, and he considers jumping down to help her, but she kills them both and rides the platform down again.\n\nAs they talk, it is revealed that Goreng volunteered to spend six months in the \"Vertical Self-Management Center\" in exchange for a diploma, and Trimagasi is serving a year-long sentence for manslaughter. Over the month, they become friendly, but on the day of the room shuffle, Goreng wakes up tied to the bed. They have been reassigned to level 171, where the platform is expected to be empty of food when it arrives. Trimagasi explains that he plans to cut strips of Goreng's flesh to sustain them both. On the eighth day, Trimagasi cuts into Goreng's leg but is attacked by Miharu as she comes down the platform. She frees Goreng and he kills Trimagasi. Miharu cuts some of Trimagasi's flesh, feeding Goreng and eating some herself before continuing down. \n\nThe following month, Goreng awakes on level 33 with a woman, Imoguiri, as a cellmate. The only thing she brought with her was her dog. Goreng recognizes her as the Administration official who interviewed him before sending him to the cells. She tells Goreng that she believes there are 200 floors. She says she was unaware of the horrible conditions and volunteered to try to fix things when she was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Imoguiri rations her food and attempts to convince those below to do so as well, but they ignore her until Goreng threatens to defecate in their food.\n\nGoreng encounters Miharu once again as she rides down on the platform but she appears critically injured, presumably from being in a fight on the higher levels. Goreng and Imoguiri grab her off the platform and tend to her wounds. Goreng explains to Imoguiri about Miharu's search for her child, but Imoguiri says nobody under the age of 16 is allowed into the facility and says Miharu entered alone. \n\nGoreng awakens to see Miharu and Imoguiri in a standoff, as Miharu has eaten Imoguiri's dog.  Goreng awakens the following month on level 202 and finds that Imoguiri has hanged herself. Goreng eats her flesh to survive, experiencing hallucinations of her and Trimagasi instructing him to do so. He then awakens the following month on level 6. His roommate, Baharat, attempts to climb up  through the upper level with the help of those above using a rope he brought into the pit. The couple living first help him, but end up defecating in his face, and pushing him back down. Estimating that there are around 250 levels, Goreng makes a plan to ride the platform down, rationing the food so all get a share, and convinces Baharat to go with him.\n\nAs they descend, they hand out portions to the prisoners, attacking those who refuse to cooperate. Going down, they encounter Miharu fighting two other residents and try to help her, but she is killed, and both men are injured. Goreng and Baharat continue to descend, eventually passing level 250 and reaching level 333 where the platform stops. Goreng notices a child hiding under the bed, and assumes it is Miharu's son. He gets off the platform, followed hesitantly by Baharat, only to have the platform continue downward, leaving them behind. They then discover the child is actually a girl, who turns out to be Miharu's  daughter. Despite Baharat's reluctance, they feed her an untouched [[panna cotta]] they had been saving as a \"message\" for the Administrators at the top. \n\nGoreng passes out and dreams of Baharat telling him that \"the girl is the message.\" The next day, Goreng finds Baharat dead after succumbing to his injuries, and takes the child with him when the platform arrives; they descend to the bottom of the pit where he once again sees Trimagasi, who tells him that \"the message requires no bearer.\" Goreng gets off the platform and walks away with Trimagasi, both turning to watch as the girl is transported upwards.\n\n== Cast==\n[[File:El hoyo prentsaurrekoa rueda de prensa.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cast and crew members at a press conference.]]\n* [[Iv\u00e1n Massagu\u00e9]] as ''Goreng'', named after ''[[:wiktionary:goreng|gor\u00e8ng]]'', which means \"fried\" in Malay/Indonesian.\n* Zorion Eguileor ([[:eu:Zorion_Egileor|eu]]) as ''Trimagasi'', named after terima kasih, which stands for \"thank you\" in Malay/Indonesian language\n* [[Antonia San Juan]] as ''Imoguiri'', named after ''[[Imogiri]]'', a royal graveyard in Indonesia. \n* [[Emilio Buale Coka]] as ''Baharat'', named after ''[[baharat]]'', a spice blend used in Turkish and Greek cuisine.\n* Alexandra Masangkay as ''Miharu'' \n* Eric L.
