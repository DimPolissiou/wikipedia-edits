Each client on the network then collects the reports from the server and independently checks their local contact logs for a TCN contained in the report. If a matching TCN is found, then the user has come in close contact with an infected patient, and is warned by the client. Since each device locally verifies contact logs, and thus contact logs are never transmitted to third parties, the central reporting server cannot by itself ascertain the identity or contact log of any client in the network. This is in contrast to competing protocols like BlueTrace, where the central reporting server receives and processes client contact logs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@frankvolkel/tracetogether-under-the-hood-7d5e509aeb5d|title=TraceTogether: under the hood|last=Liauw|first=\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddec Frank|date=2020-04-09|website=Medium|language=en|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>\n\n== Temporary contact numbers ==\nThe entire protocol is based on the principle of ''temporary contact numbers'' (TCN), a unique and anonymous 128-bit identifier generated deterministically from a seed value on a client device. TCNs are used to identify people with which a user has come in contact, and the seed is used to compactly report infection to a central reporting server. TCN reports are authenticated to be genuine by a secret held only by the client.\n\n=== Generation ===\n\nTo generate a TCN, first a ''report authorization key'' (RAK) and ''report verification key'' (RVK) are created as the signing and verification keys of a signature scheme (RAK-RVK pair). In the reference implementation this pair is created using the [[Ed25519]] signature scheme.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/TCNCoalition/TCN/blob/main/src/keys.rs|title=TCNCoalition/TCN/src/keys.rs|last=|first=|date=|website=GitHub|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref>{{Rp|line. 13}} Then, using the RAK an initial ''temporary contact key'' (TCK) is generated using the algorithm <math>\ntck_{0} = H\\_tck(rak)\n</math>, where <math>\nH\\_tck()\n</math> is the [[SHA-2|SHA-256]] [[hash function]] as <math>\nH\\_tck(s) = SHA256(\\text{b'H}\\_\\text{TCK'}||s)\n</math>. This TCK is not used to generate any TCNs, but is used in the next TCK; where all future TCKs are calculated using the algorithm <math>\ntck_{i} = H\\_tck(rvk || tck_{i-1})\n</math>. A 128 bit TCN is then generated from a given TCK using the algorithm <math>\ntcn_{i>0} = H\\_tcn(le\\_u16(i) || tck_{i})\n</math>, where  <math>\nle\\_u16()\n</math> formats a supplied number as a [[little endian]] unsigned 2 byte integer,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://docs.rs/nom/2.2.1/nom/fn.le_u16.html|title=nom::le_u16 - Rust|website=docs.rs|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref> and <math>\nH\\_tcn()\n</math> is the SHA-256 hash function as <math>\nH\\_tcn(s) = SHA256(\\text{b'H}\\_\\text{TCN'}||s)[0:128]\n</math>. The following diagram demonstrates the key derivation process:[[File:TCN_Protocol_Key_Generation.svg|center]]TCNs are unique to each device encounter, and RAK-RVK pairs are cycled at regular intervals to allow a client to report only specific periods of contact. \n\n=== Reporting ===\nWhen a client wishes to submit a report for the TCN indicies <math>\ns > 0\n</math> to <math>\ne\n</math>, it structures the report as <math>\nreport = rvk || tck_{s - 1} || le\\_u16(s) || le\\_u16(e) || memo\n</math>. A signature is then calculated using the RAK, and it is transmitted to the server as <math>\ns\\_report = report||sig\n</math>.\n\nBecause any given TCK can only be used to derive an equal or higher indexed TCNs, by submitting <math>\ntck_{s-1}\n</math> no encounters prior to <math>\ntcn_{s-1}\n</math> can be calculated. However there is no upper limit to encounters calculated using the same RAK-RVK pair, which is why they are cycled often. To prevent clients calculating unused TCNs, <math>\ne\n</math> indicates the last TCN index generated with the given RVK.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/TCNCoalition/tcn-client-android/blob/develop/tcn-client-android/src/main/java/org/tcncoalition/tcnclient/TcnKeys.kt|title=TCNCoalition/tcn-client-android/src/main/java/org/tcncoalition/tcnclient/TcnKeys.kt|last=|first=|date=|website=GitHub|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref>{{Rp|lines. 49-61}} Additionally, since the RVK is used to calculate a TCK, and <math>\ntck_{s-1}\n</math> is provided, no valid TCNs in the reporting period can be derived from an illegitimate report. The only correct TCN calculable from a mismatched RVK and <math>\ntck_{s-1}\n</math> is <math>\ntcn_{s-1}\n</math>, the TCN before the start of the reporting period.\n\nOnce a report is received, clients individually recalculate TCKs and TCNs for a given period using the original algorithms:<math display=\"block\">\n\\begin{array}{lcr}\ntck_s = H\\_tck(rvk || tck_{s-1})\\\\\ntcn_{s} = H\\_tcn(le\\_u16(s) || tck_{s})\\\\\ntck_{s+1} = H\\_tck(rvk || tck_{s})\\\\\ntcn_{s+1} = H\\_tcn(le\\_u16(s+1) || tck_{s+1})\\\\\n...\\\\\ntck_{e} = H\\_tck(rvk || tck_{e-1})\\\\\ntcn_{e} = H\\_tcn(le\\_u16(e) || tck_{e})\n\\end{array}\n</math>This is used by client devices to check their local contact logs for potential encounters with the infected patient, but has the dual benefit of verifying reports since false reports will never produce matching TCNs.\n\n=== Memo ===\nIn the report structure, the memo is a space for freeform messages that differ between TCN implementations. The section is between 2 and 257 bytes, and made up of a tag identifying the specific implementation, as well as a data and data length pair. It is formatted as  <math>\nmemo = tag || len(data) || data\n</math>. The data is standardized for different tags, and can be as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Tag\n!Data standard\n|-\n|{{Code|code=0x0}}\n|[[CoEpi]] symptom report v1\n|-\n|{{Code|code=0x1}}\n|[[CovidWatch]] test result v1\n|-\n|{{Code|code=0x2-0xfe}}\n|Allocated for future official TCN apps or versions\n|-\n|{{Code|code=0xff}}\n|Reserved (can be used to add more than 256 types later)\n|}\n\n== Technical specification ==\nThe protocol can be divided into two responsibilities: an encounter between two devices running TCN apps, and the notification of potential infection to users that came in contact with a patient. For the purposes of this specification, these areas are named the ''encounter handshake'', and ''infection reporting''. The ''encounter handshake'' runs on Bluetooth LE and defines how two devices acknowledge each other's presence. The ''infection reporting'' is built on [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTPS]] and defines how infection notices are distributed among clients.\n\n=== Encounter handshake ===\nWhen two devices come within range of each other, they exchange a handshake containing TCNs. In order to achieve this the encounter handshake operates in two modes (both with two sub-modes), broadcast oriented and connection oriented. Broadcast oriented operates using the modes broadcaster and observer, while connection oriented operates using peripheral and central. The two modes are used to circumvent certain device limitations, particularly in regard to iOS restrictions in place before version 13.4.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/fcww2x/feature_ios_134_beta_enables_ble_long_range/|title=r/iOSBeta - [Feature] IOS 13.4 beta enables BLE long range support (iPhone 11/11 Pro only)|website=reddit|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref> In both modes the protocol is identified with the 16 bit [[Universally unique identifier|UUID]] {{Code|code=0xC019}}.\n\nIn broadcast mode, a broadcaster advertises a 16-byte TCN using the service data field of the advertisement data. The observer reads the TCN from this field. In connection-oriented mode, the peripheral advertises using the UUID. The service exposes a read and writeable packet for sharing TCNs. After sharing a TCN, the central disconnects from the peripheral.\n\n=== Infection reporting ===\nWhen a user tests positive for infection, they upload a signed report allowing the past 14 days of encounters to be calculated to a central server. On a regular basis, client devices download reports from the server and check their local contact logs using the verification algorithm. If there is a matching record, the app notifies the user to potential infection.\n\n== TCN Coalition ==\nOn 5 April 2020, the global [[TCN Coalition]] was founded by groups that had coalesced around what was essentially the same approach and largely overlapping protocols, with the goal to reduce fragmentation, and enable global interoperability of tracing and alerting apps, a key aspect of achieving widespread adoption.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite web|url=https://tcn-coalition.org/|title=TCN Coalition \u00b7 A Global Coalition for Privacy-First Digital Contact Tracing Protocols to Fight

Each client on the network then collects the reports from the server and independently checks their local contact logs for a TCN contained in the report. If a matching TCN is found, then the user has come in close contact with an infected patient, and is warned by the client. Since each device locally verifies contact logs, and thus contact logs are never transmitted to third parties, the central reporting server cannot by itself ascertain the identity or contact log of any client in the network. This is in contrast to competing protocols like BlueTrace, where the central reporting server receives and processes client contact logs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@frankvolkel/tracetogether-under-the-hood-7d5e509aeb5d|title=TraceTogether: under the hood|last=Liauw|first=\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddec Frank|date=2020-04-09|website=Medium|language=en|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>\n\n== Temporary Contact Numbers ==\nThe entire protocol is based on the principle of Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN), a unique and anonymous 128 bit identifier generated deterministically from a seed value on a client device. TCNs are used to identify people with which a user has come in contact, and the seed is used to compactly report infection to a central reporting server. TCN reports are authenticated to be genuine by a secret held only by the client.\n\n=== Generation ===\n\nTo generate a TCN, first a ''report authorization key'' (RAK) and ''report verification key'' (RVK) are created as the signing and verification keys of a signature scheme (RAK-RVK pair). In the reference implementation this pair is created using the [[Ed25519]] signature scheme.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/TCNCoalition/TCN/blob/main/src/keys.rs|title=TCNCoalition/TCN/src/keys.rs|last=|first=|date=|website=GitHub|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref>{{Rp|line. 13}} Then, using the RAK an initial ''temporary contact key'' (TCK) is generated using the algorithm <math>\ntck_{0} = H\\_tck(rak)\n</math>, where <math>\nH\\_tck()\n</math> is the [[SHA-2|SHA-256]] [[hash function]] as <math>\nH\\_tck(s) = SHA256(\\text{b'H}\\_\\text{TCK'}||s)\n</math>. This TCK is not used to generate any TCNs, but is used in the next TCK; where all future TCKs are calculated using the algorithm <math>\ntck_{i} = H\\_tck(rvk || tck_{i-1})\n</math>. A 128 bit TCN is then generated from a given TCK using the algorithm <math>\ntcn_{i>0} = H\\_tcn(le\\_u16(i) || tck_{i})\n</math>, where  <math>\nle\\_u16()\n</math> formats a supplied number as a [[little endian]] unsigned 2 byte integer,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://docs.rs/nom/2.2.1/nom/fn.le_u16.html|title=nom::le_u16 - Rust|website=docs.rs|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref> and <math>\nH\\_tcn()\n</math> is the SHA-256 hash function as <math>\nH\\_tcn(s) = SHA256(\\text{b'H}\\_\\text{TCN'}||s)[0:128]\n</math>. The following diagram demonstrates the key derivation process:[[File:TCN_Protocol_Key_Generation.svg|center]]TCNs are unique to each device encounter, and RAK-RVK pairs are cycled at regular intervals to allow a client to report only specific periods of contact. \n\n=== Reporting ===\nWhen a client wishes to submit a report for the TCN indicies <math>\ns > 0\n</math> to <math>\ne\n</math>, it structures the report as <math>\nreport = rvk || tck_{s - 1} || le\\_u16(s) || le\\_u16(e) || memo\n</math>. A signature is then calculated using the RAK, and it is transmitted to the server as <math>\ns\\_report = report||sig\n</math>.\n\nBecause any given TCK can only be used to derive an equal or higher indexed TCNs, by submitting <math>\ntck_{s-1}\n</math> no encounters prior to <math>\ntcn_{s-1}\n</math> can be calculated. However there is no upper limit to encounters calculated using the same RAK-RVK pair, which is why they are cycled often. To prevent clients calculating unused TCNs, <math>\ne\n</math> indicates the last TCN index generated with the given RVK.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/TCNCoalition/tcn-client-android/blob/develop/tcn-client-android/src/main/java/org/tcncoalition/tcnclient/TcnKeys.kt|title=TCNCoalition/tcn-client-android/src/main/java/org/tcncoalition/tcnclient/TcnKeys.kt|last=|first=|date=|website=GitHub|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref>{{Rp|lines. 49-61}} Additionally, since the RVK is used to calculate a TCK, and <math>\ntck_{s-1}\n</math> is provided, no valid TCNs in the reporting period can be derived from an illegitimate report. The only correct TCN calculable from a mismatched RVK and <math>\ntck_{s-1}\n</math> is <math>\ntcn_{s-1}\n</math>, the TCN before the start of the reporting period.\n\nOnce a report is received, clients individually recalculate TCKs and TCNs for a given period using the original algorithms:<math display=\"block\">\n\\begin{array}{lcr}\ntck_s = H\\_tck(rvk || tck_{s-1})\\\\\ntcn_{s} = H\\_tcn(le\\_u16(s) || tck_{s})\\\\\ntck_{s+1} = H\\_tck(rvk || tck_{s})\\\\\ntcn_{s+1} = H\\_tcn(le\\_u16(s+1) || tck_{s+1})\\\\\n...\\\\\ntck_{e} = H\\_tck(rvk || tck_{e-1})\\\\\ntcn_{e} = H\\_tcn(le\\_u16(e) || tck_{e})\n\\end{array}\n</math>This is used by client devices to check their local contact logs for potential encounters with the infected patient, but has the dual benefit of verifying reports since false reports will never produce matching TCNs.\n\n=== Memo ===\nIn the report structure, the memo is a space for freeform messages that differ between TCN implementations. The section is between 2 and 257 bytes, and made up of a tag identifying the specific implementation, as well as a data and data length pair. It is formatted as  <math>\nmemo = tag || len(data) || data\n</math>. The data is standardized for different tags, and can be as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Tag\n!Data standard\n|-\n|{{Code|code=0x0}}\n|[[CoEpi]] symptom report v1\n|-\n|{{Code|code=0x1}}\n|[[CovidWatch]] test result v1\n|-\n|{{Code|code=0x2-0xfe}}\n|Allocated for future official TCN apps or versions\n|-\n|{{Code|code=0xff}}\n|Reserved (can be used to add more than 256 types later)\n|}\n\n== Technical specification ==\nThe protocol can be divided into two responsibilities: an encounter between two devices running TCN apps, and the notification of potential infection to users that came in contact with a patient. For the purposes of this specification, these areas are named the ''encounter handshake'', and ''infection reporting''. The ''encounter handshake'' runs on Bluetooth LE and defines how two devices acknowledge each other's presence. The ''infection reporting'' is built on [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTPS]] and defines how infection notices are distributed among clients.\n\n=== Encounter handshake ===\nWhen two devices come within range of each other, they exchange a handshake containing TCNs. In order to achieve this the encounter handshake operates in two modes (both with two sub-modes), broadcast oriented and connection oriented. Broadcast oriented operates using the modes broadcaster and observer, while connection oriented operates using peripheral and central. The two modes are used to circumvent certain device limitations, particularly in regard to iOS restrictions in place before version 13.4.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/fcww2x/feature_ios_134_beta_enables_ble_long_range/|title=r/iOSBeta - [Feature] IOS 13.4 beta enables BLE long range support (iPhone 11/11 Pro only)|website=reddit|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref> In both modes the protocol is identified with the 16 bit [[Universally unique identifier|UUID]] {{Code|code=0xC019}}.\n\nIn broadcast mode, a broadcaster advertises a 16-byte TCN using the service data field of the advertisement data. The observer reads the TCN from this field. In connection-oriented mode, the peripheral advertises using the UUID. The service exposes a read and writeable packet for sharing TCNs. After sharing a TCN, the central disconnects from the peripheral.\n\n=== Infection reporting ===\nWhen a user tests positive for infection, they upload a signed report allowing the past 14 days of encounters to be calculated to a central server. On a regular basis, client devices download reports from the server and check their local contact logs using the verification algorithm. If there is a matching record, the app notifies the user to potential infection.\n\n== TCN Coalition ==\nOn 5 April 2020, the global [[TCN Coalition]] was founded by groups that had coalesced around what was essentially the same approach and largely overlapping protocols, with the goal to reduce fragmentation, and enable global interoperability of tracing and alerting apps, a key aspect of achieving widespread adoption.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite web|url=https://tcn-coalition.org/|title=TCN Coalition \u00b7 A Global Coalition for Privacy-First Digital Contact Tracing Protocols to Fight COVID-19|website=tcn-coalition.org|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref> The TCN Coalition also helped establish the [[Data Rights for Digital Contact Tracing and Alerting]] framework, which functions as a bill of rights for users of such apps.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dcta-datarights.com/|title=Data Rights for Digital Contact Tracing and Alerting \u00b7 Overview|last=Reed <questions@dcta-datarights.org>|first=Harper|website=dcta-datarights.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\nCurrently the protocol is currently used by TCN Coalition members [[CoEpi]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.miragenews.com/will-smartphones-help-us-keep-covid-19-under-control/,%20https://www.miragenews.com/will-smartphones-help-us-keep-covid-19-under-control|title=Will Smartphones Help Us Keep COVID-19 Under Control? {{!}} Mirage News|last=News|first=Mirage|date=2020-04-15|website=www.miragenews.com|language=en-AU|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Co-Epi/app-android|date=2020-04-19|url=https://github.com/Co-Epi/app-android|publisher=CoEpi|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref> and [[CovidWatch]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.covid-watch.org/|title=Covid Watch|website=www.covid-watch.org|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref><ref name=\":2\" /> and was likely a source of inspiration for the similar [[Google / Apple contact tracing project]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://covid-watch.org/press_releases/google_apple_press_release|title=Covid Watch Celebrates Apple and Google\u2019s COVID-19 Contact Tracing Announcement|last=|first=|date=|website=www.covid-watch.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref><ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[BlueTrace]]\n* [[Google / Apple contact tracing project]]\n*[[Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing]]\n\n== References ==\n\n<references />{{2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic}}{{FOSS}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n* [https://tcn-coalition.org/ TCN Coalition]\n* [https://github.com/TCNCoalition/TCN Specification and reference implementation]\n\n[[Category:Application layer protocols]]\n[[Category:Computer-related introductions in 2020]]\n[[Category:Software associated with the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]]\n[[Category:Bluetooth software]]\n[[Category:Medical software]]\n[[Category:Android (operating system) software]]\n[[Category:IOS software]]\n[[Category:2020 software]]\n[[Category:Software using the MIT license]]\n[[Category:Digital contact tracing protocols]]\n", "name_user": "Nyq", "label": "safe", "comment": "Decapitalized acronym expansion as perMOS:CAPSACRS, decapitalized common noun", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCN_Protocol"}

[[Tom Nook]] is a [[Japanese raccoon dog|tanuki]] character who functions as both a shop owner and real estate broker, giving the player a loan for their house and allowing them to pay it back with no interest. He is one of the only residents of the town to follow a [[Capitalism|capitalist]] ethos. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/tom-nook-needs-to-get-with-the-times-1829149177|title=Tom Nook Needs To Get With The Times|last=Jackson|first=Gita|website=Kotaku|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-18}}</ref> [[Mr. Resetti]] is a mole character who appears from underground whenever players shut off the game without saving, berating them for circumventing one of the game's systems.

Gameplay is [[Nonlinear gameplay|open-ended]]: players have no defined objectives, but are instead encouraged to spend their time in the village performing any number of activities, which include collecting items, planting plants or other items, and socializing with the village's residents. ''Animal Crossing'' games are played in [[Real time (media)|real time]], utilizing the [[video game console]]'s internal clock and calendar. Thus, passage of time in the game world reflects that in reality, as well as the current season and time of day. Some in-game events, such as holidays or the growth of a tree, occur at certain times or require some duration of time to have passed.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_preview\"/>\n\nOne notable feature of the ''Animal Crossing'' series is the high level of customization available, some of which affects the outcome of the game.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_review\" /> The [[player character]] is both named and gendered by the real life player at the start of the game, and their appearance can be modified by buying or designing custom clothes and accessories or changing the hairstyle (introduced in ''[[Animal Crossing: Wild World|Wild World]]''). The player's house can also be furnished, decorated, and later expanded: the player can purchase and collect furniture and place it anywhere in the house, as well as change both the wallpaper and floor designs. While its terrain, building locations, and initial residents are randomly generated when the game is first begun (except in ''Animal Crossing: New Leaf'', in which the player decides between four given towns, and ''Animal Crossing: New Horizons'', in which the player similarly decides between four given islands), the village's name and anthem, as well as some of the residents' catchphrases, are also determined by the player.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_review\"/>\n\nCollecting items is a major facet of ''Animal Crossing'': the player can explore the village and gather objects, including fruit from trees, seashells, and discarded items. Nearly all objects can be sold for Bells, the in-game currency. Players collect objects to obtain more Bells, which can then be used to buy furniture and clothing, purchase home expansions, invest in stocks, and play games. A number of specialized tools are available for other activities such as fishing and insect collecting. Special items, such as fossils and paintings, may be donated to the village museum. The player can choose to socialize with the other animal residents by engaging in conversation, sending and receiving letters, bartering, or playing hide-and-seek. Residents may move in or out of the village depending on the player's actions.\n\nAll installments of ''Animal Crossing'' allow some form of communication between players, both offline and [[Online game|online]]. A single village can house up to four human players, though only one can be exploring the village at any given time.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_preview\">{{cite web| title=Animal Crossing Preview |last=Schneider |first=Peer |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2002/05/30/animal-crossing |date=May 30, 2002 |publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=February 13, 2017}}</ref> The players can interact via written messages through the village post office or bulletin board.

Some in-game events, such as holidays or the growth of a tree, occur at certain times or require some duration of time to have passed.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_preview\"/>\n\nOne notable feature of the ''Animal Crossing'' series is the high level of customization available, some of which affects the outcome of the game.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_review\" /> The [[player character]] is both named and gendered by the real life player at the start of the game, and their appearance can be modified by buying or designing custom clothes and accessories or changing the hairstyle (introduced in ''[[Animal Crossing: Wild World|Wild World]]''). The player's house can also be furnished, decorated, and later expanded: the player can purchase and collect furniture and place it anywhere in the house, as well as change both the wallpaper and floor designs. While its terrain, building locations, and initial residents are randomly generated when the game is first begun (except in ''Animal Crossing: New Leaf'', in which the player decides between four given towns, and ''Animal Crossing: New Horizons'', in which the player similarly decides between four given islands), the village's name and anthem, as well as some of the residents' catchphrases, are also determined by the player.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_review\"/>\n\nCollecting items is a major facet of ''Animal Crossing'': the player can explore the village and gather objects, including fruit from trees, seashells, and discarded items. Nearly all objects can be sold for Bells, the in-game currency. Players collect objects to obtain more Bells, which can then be used to buy furniture and clothing, purchase home expansions, invest in stocks, and play games. A number of specialized tools are available for other activities such as fishing and insect collecting. Special items, such as fossils and paintings, may be donated to the village museum. The player can choose to socialize with the other animal residents by engaging in conversation, sending and receiving letters, bartering, or playing hide-and-seek. Residents may move in or out of the village depending on the player's actions.\n\nAll installments of ''Animal Crossing'' allow some form of communication between players, both offline and [[Online game|online]]. A single village can house up to four human players, though only one can be exploring the village at any given time.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_preview\">{{cite web| title=Animal Crossing Preview |last=Schneider |first=Peer |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2002/05/30/animal-crossing |date=May 30, 2002 |publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=February 13, 2017}}</ref> The players can interact via written messages through the village post office or bulletin board.

The SEAP Games was conceptualised by Luang Sukhum Nayaoradit, then Vice-President of the [[Thailand Olympic Committee]]. The proposed rationale was that a regional sports event will help promote co-operation, understanding and relations among countries in the Southeast Asian region.\n\nSix countries, Burma (now [[Myanmar]]), [[Kampuchea]] (now [[Cambodia]]), [[Laos]], [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]] (now [[Malaysia]]), [[Thailand]] and [[Vietnam]] were the founding members. These countries agreed to hold the Games biennially in June 1959 and SEAP Games Federation Committee was formed thereafter.<ref name=\"charter\"/>\n\nThe first SEAP Games were held in [[Bangkok]] from 12\u201317 December 1959 comprising more than 527 athletes and officials from Thailand, Burma (now Myanmar), Malaya (now Malaysia), Singapore, South Vietnam and Laos participating in 12 sports.\n\nAt the 8th SEAP Games in 1975, the SEAP Federation considered the inclusion of [[Brunei]], [[Indonesia]] and the [[Philippines]]. These countries were formally admitted in 1977, the same year when SEAP Federation changed their name to the ''Southeast Asian Games Federation'' (SEAGF), and the games were known as the '''Southeast Asian Games'''. [[East Timor]] was admitted at the [[2003 Southeast Asian Games|22nd Southeast Asian Games]] in [[Vietnam]].\n\nThe [[2009 Southeast Asian Games]] was the first time Laos has ever hosted a Southeast Asian Games (Laos had previously declined hosting the 1965 Southeast Asian Peninsular Games citing financial difficulties). Running from 9\u201318 December, it has also commemorated the 50 years of the Southeast Asian Games, held in [[Vientiane]], [[Laos]].\n\n==Logo==\nThe Southeast Asian Games logo was introduced during the 1959 edition in Bangkok, depicting six rings that represent the six founding members and was used until the 1997 edition in Jakarta. The number of rings increased to 10 during the 1999 edition in Brunei to reflect the inclusion of Singapore which was admitted into the Southeast Asian Games Federation in 1961 and Brunei, Indonesia, and the Philippines which joined the organization in 1977. The number of rings was again increased to 11 during the 2011 games in Indonesia to reflect the federation's newest member, East Timor which was admitted in 2003.\n\n==Participating NOCs==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#E8E8E8\"\n!

She reached this milestone during the [[2005 Southeast Asian Games|2005 Games]], overtaking the previous record of 39 gold medals set by another Singaporean swimmer [[Patricia Chan]].\n\n==Criticism==\nThe games is unique in that it has no official limits to the number of sports to be contested, and the range can be decided by the organizing host pending approval by the Southeast Asian Games Federation. Aside from core sports that must be featured, the host is free to drop or introduce other events.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/2103469/southeast-asian-games-yet-win-gold-sporting-spirit|title=Southeast Asian Games yet to win gold for sporting spirit|agency=[[South China Morning Post]]|author=Pattharapong Rattanasevee |date=21 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThis leeway has resulted in hosts maximizing their medal hauls by dropping sports disadvantageous to themselves relative to their peers and the introduction of obscure sports, often at short notice, thus preventing most other nations from building credible opponents. Examples of these include:\n\n* At the [[2001 Southeast Asian Games]], Malaysia introduced [[p\u00e9tanque]], and [[netball]].\n* At the [[2003 Southeast Asian Games]], Vietnam added [[fin swimming]] and [[Jianzi|shuttlecock]], and had the wushu offer 28 golds from 16 in 2001.\n* In the [[2005 Southeast Asian Games]], the [[Philippines]] added [[Eskrima|arnis]], a demonstration sport in 2003, with six sets of medals, and it won three golds. Also added were baseball, dancesport and softball.\n* At the [[2007 Southeast Asian Games]], [[Thailand]] added categories of [[sepak takraw]] and used a new kind of ball used by its athletes for a year but never used by other countries. [[Futsal]] was also added. Thailand won nearly all medals in the event.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sports |url=http://english.vietnamnet.vn/en/sports/5317/sea-games-or-a-village-festival.html |title=VietNamNet - SEA Games or a village festival &#124; SEA Games or a village festival |publisher=English.vietnamnet.vn |date= |accessdate=2 June 2011}}</ref>\n* In the [[2011 Southeast Asian Games]], [[Indonesia]] dropped the team events in table tennis and shrunk the medals offered in shooting to just 14 golds from 19 in 2009 and 33 in 2007.

The games is under regulation of the [[Southeast Asian Games Federation]] with supervision by the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) and the [[Olympic Council of Asia]].\n\n==History==\nThe Southeast Asian Games owes its origins to the '''''South East Asian Peninsular Games''''' or '''''SEAP Games'''''. On 22 May 1958, delegates from the countries in Southeast Asian Peninsula attending the [[1958 Asian Games|Asian Games]] in Tokyo, Japan had a meeting and agreed to establish a sport organisation. The SEAP Games was conceptualised by Luang Sukhum Nayaoradit, then Vice-President of the [[Thailand Olympic Committee]]. The proposed rationale was that a regional sports event will help promote co-operation, understanding and relations among countries in the Southeast Asian region.\n\nSix countries, Burma (now [[Myanmar]]), [[Kampuchea]] (now [[Cambodia]]), [[Laos]], [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]] (now [[Malaysia]]), [[Thailand]] and [[Vietnam]] were the founding members. These countries agreed to hold the Games biennially in June 1959 and SEAP Games Federation Committee was formed thereafter.<ref name=\"charter\"/>\n\nThe first SEAP Games were held in [[Bangkok]] from 12\u201317 December 1959 comprising more than 527 athletes and officials from Thailand, Burma (now Myanmar), Malaya (now Malaysia), Singapore, South Vietnam and Laos participating in 12 sports.\n\nAt the 8th SEAP Games in 1975, the SEAP Federation considered the inclusion of [[Brunei]], [[Indonesia]] and the [[Philippines]]. These countries were formally admitted in 1977, the same year when SEAP Federation changed their name to the ''Southeast Asian Games Federation'' (SEAGF), and the games were known as the '''Southeast Asian Games'''. [[East Timor]] was admitted at the [[2003 Southeast Asian Games|22nd Southeast Asian Games]] in [[Vietnam]].\n\nThe [[2009 Southeast Asian Games]] was the first time Laos has ever hosted a Southeast Asian Games (Laos had previously declined hosting the 1965 Southeast Asian Peninsular Games citing financial difficulties). Running from 9\u201318 December, it has also commemorated the 50 years of the Southeast Asian Games, held in [[Vientiane]], [[Laos]].\n\n==Logo==\nThe Southeast Asian Games logo was introduced during the 1959 edition in Bangkok, depicting six rings that represent the six founding members and was used until the 1997 edition in Jakarta. The number of rings increased to 10 during the 1999 edition in Brunei to reflect the inclusion of Singapore which was admitted into the Southeast Asian Games Federation in 1961 and Brunei, Indonesia, and the Philippines which joined the organization in 1977. The number of rings was again increased to 11 during the 2011 games in Indonesia to reflect the federation's newest member, East Timor which was admitted in 2003.\n\n==Participating NOCs==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#E8E8E8\"\n!

As the designated host, [[Cambodia]] was not able to host the event due to unsettling in-country conditions, along with a disagreement with the [[International Amateur Athletic Federation]]. The 3rd SEAP Games then passed to [[Laos]] as hosts, but they begged off the 1965 event citing financial difficulties.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the SEA Games |url=http://www.olympic.org.my/web/gamesrecords/sea/sea_history.htm |work=www.olympic.org.my |accessdate=26 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041217101809/http://www.olympic.org.my/web/gamesrecords/sea/sea_history.htm |archivedate=17 December 2004 }}</ref>\n\n==Sports==\n{{Main article|Southeast Asian Games sports}}\nAccording to the SEAGF Charter and Rules, a host nation must stage a minimum of 22 sports: the two compulsory sports from Category 1 (athletics and aquatics), in addition to a minimum of 14 sports from Category 2, and a maximum of 8 sports from Category 3 (shaded grey in the table below).

The [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) does not use codes for South Vietnam anymore after the unification with North Vietnam.\n*{{note|4|[4]}} \u2013 Competed as Burma until 1987.\n*{{note|5|[5]}} \u2013 Competed as Kampuchea, and Khmer Republic.</small>\n\n==List of multiple Southeast Asian Games medalists==\n{{Main|List of multiple Southeast Asian Games medalists}}\nVarious individuals have won multiple medals at the Games, including the preceding Southeast Asian Peninsular Games. \n\nAs of 2019, Singaporean swimmer [[Joscelin Yeo]] has won the most Southeast Asian Games medals with 55 (40 gold, 12 silver, 3 bronze). She reached this milestone during the [[2005 Southeast Asian Games|2005 Games]], overtaking the previous record of 39 gold medals set by another Singaporean swimmer [[Patricia Chan]].\n\n==Criticism==\nThe games is unique in that it has no official limits to the number of sports to be contested, and the range can be decided by the organizing host pending approval by the Southeast Asian Games Federation. Aside from core sports that must be featured, the host is free to drop or introduce other events.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/2103469/southeast-asian-games-yet-win-gold-sporting-spirit|title=Southeast Asian Games yet to win gold for sporting spirit|agency=[[South China Morning Post]]|author=Pattharapong Rattanasevee |date=21 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThis leeway has resulted in hosts maximizing their medal hauls by dropping sports disadvantageous to themselves relative to their peers and the introduction of obscure sports, often at short notice, thus preventing most other nations from building credible opponents. Examples of these include:\n\n* At the [[2001 Southeast Asian Games]], Malaysia introduced [[p\u00e9tanque]], and [[netball]].\n* At the [[2003 Southeast Asian Games]], Vietnam added [[fin swimming]] and [[Jianzi|shuttlecock]], and had the wushu offer 28 golds from 16 in 2001.\n* In the [[2005 Southeast Asian Games]], the [[Philippines]] added [[Eskrima|arnis]], a demonstration sport in 2003, with six sets of medals, and it won three golds. Also added were baseball, dancesport and softball.\n* At the [[2007 Southeast Asian Games]], [[Thailand]] added categories of [[sepak takraw]] and used a new kind of ball used by its athletes for a year but never used by other countries. [[Futsal]] was also added. Thailand won nearly all medals in the event.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sports |url=http://english.vietnamnet.vn/en/sports/5317/sea-games-or-a-village-festival.html |title=VietNamNet - SEA Games or a village festival &#124; SEA Games or a village festival |publisher=English.vietnamnet.vn |date= |accessdate=2 June 2011}}</ref>\n* In the [[2011 Southeast Asian Games]], [[Indonesia]] dropped the team events in table tennis and shrunk the medals offered in shooting to just 14 golds from 19 in 2009 and 33 in 2007.

Although the case was deemed cold at the time, Boyd's second investigation leads to a surprise turn of events, spurring the killer out of hiding, and forcing him to abduct a second girl, Jodie Whitemore. Realising that his actions have resulted in the girl's abduction, Boyd is forced to play catch-up as the killer sends him information regarding the girl's whereabouts. Boyd has Alice Miller's body exhumed, hoping that new DNA tests may reveal the killer's true identity, and provide clues as to the location of the missing girl, Jodie. However, the killer is keen to kill again, and it's a race against time for Boyd to save the missing girl. When the team pinpoint the girl's location, they use Mel as bait to lure the killer out. However, their plan soon backfires, when Boyd discovers that the kidnapper is looking for more than money - he wants revenge on Boyd's team - and Mel is in danger.\n\n''During this episode, we see Boyd with his wife and two-year-old son, who are never seen again in later episodes. They were written out in favour of a totally different storyline after the pilot. The opening scene of \"Burn Out\" explicitly shows that Boyd had a son who has vanished years before and would have been 25 in the timeframe of the episode. The whole story of Boyd's (presumably) dead son is told in the second part of \"Blind Beggar\". Storylines about abused, missing or dead children remained a recurring theme in the series throughout the nine series.

Boyd later discovers that Marina's father died in a car accident a few years previously in the same street, and that Marina refuses to accept that his death was simply an accident. Boyd is intrigued, and reluctantly agrees to investigate. Frankie performs forensic tests on Marina's father's car, and proves that he was still alive after the crash, and could have easily escaped. However, the answers they uncover may mean that the danger to Marina is much greater than any of them had thought possible. Boyd has Marina's uncle, Mike Coleman, and her mother, Gwen, brought in for questioning, while Frankie searches their house. As she finds items that were recovered from the car nine years ago, she suspects that Perry Coleman was being blackmailed by Rod Brogan.

The team set about trying to pinpoint the identity of the body, which appears to have been buried with the accoutrements of certain Catholic rituals. However, an unusual piece of evidence - a message in Braille buried with the corpse, turns out to be a passage from one of St. Paul's letters to the Corinthians and proves to be a vital clue in identifying both the victim, and the killer. As the team suspect that the body was never meant to be discovered, the hunt continues for the murderer, until former church reverend Father Stuart is brutually murdered in similar circumstances. Suspecting that he may have known the identity of the killer, Boyd decides to dig deeper, and the team uncover some long hidden family secrets while questioning the community and congregation.

When new evidence casts doubt upon her version of her events, Boyd decides to challenge the validity of the conviction, and decides to investigate further in order to discover what really happened that night. Suspecting that her son may have been present at the time of the murders, Boyd begins to wonder if Annie is covering for somebody else, suspecting that they may have been responsible. When his theory is proven right, Annie re-unites with her long lost son, who she believed to be responsible, but was in fact, simply a witness, and the hunt for the real killer continues.

The problem is, the list of suspects fails to help narrow down the identity of the killer. At the time of her death, she was being stalked by an obsessive whom she had met online, was struggling with an ex-husband who didn't want to let her go, and was also being harassed by the father of her unborn child. When the stalker confesses to killing her, Grace isn't entirely convinced he is telling the truth. Matters take a turn for the worse when the stalker's body is found nailed to a bridge over a river. Determined to get to the bottom of the case, Boyd makes use of dubious tactics to coach the killer into making a mistake.

The team take a second look at Rice's crimes, prompted by Boyd's unshakeable belief that Rice had claimed other, hitherto undiscovered victims. Boyd, who has personal links to the case, and Grace decide to use Mel to lure a confession from Rice, but the plan goes horribly wrong when Rice tries to stab Mel. Reluctantly choosing to continue using his assistance, Boyd tries to protect Dr. Delaney from repeating her terrifying ordeal at the hands of a copycat assailant. It becomes apparent that Rice might have help on the outside, and it soon becomes crucial that Boyd confronts Dr. Delaney, to find out what went on during her captivity.

Grace is intrigued by this strange expression of guilt, but Boyd and the rest of the team are tempted to dismiss it as the meanderings of a dying man. However, the investigation takes a rather abrupt turn when Frankie discovers that Newman did not die of natural causes - and was murdered in such a way as to make it look so. The team soon realize there is a lot more to Newman than they first imagined. Added to all that, there is a link to a famous fifties trial as a result of which, a gangster was hanged for killing two policemen. Recent inquiries into Newman's past and the identities of the possible twelve murder victims uncover a connection to the infamous trial and execution.

Boyd's progress on the case is hampered not only by a Home Office audit, which means the team will be shadowed throughout, but also by the fact that the original investigation was conducted by one of his old flames, with whom he is desperate to rekindle a relationship. As the team continue with their investigation at Whitehall, they quickly discover the atmosphere to be very dark and secretive, and soon realise that only cunning tactics will allow them to flush out Katherine's killer, and eliminate those who simply slept with her in an attempt to get her pregnant.

However, when evidence points to another assailant, he is forced to let his original suspect go - which later results in a suicide attempt. Feeling guilty that he persecuted the wrong person, Boyd goes on a manhunt in order to discover the real identity of her killer. When Joanna's sister, Clara, informs Boyd that she is being followed, he suspects that the killer is going to strike again, and uses Clara as bait to lure him out.

The identity of the victims reveal that the film's content may not be so fictional after all. And when Spencer looks into his family history, he discovers that his father may be linked to the mysterious men involved. Just as Boyd believes he has cracked the case, the gangster responsible for the bodies behind the walls decides it's time to avenge old wounds, and the unearthing of past events provokes more murders and an international turf war between old rivals. As events start to become even more complicated, Boyd realises that Spencer's family history is the key to unravelling the mystery, and Spencer is forced to confront his mother and discover the truth about the reason his father left.\n\n''In the opening sequence of this story's first episode, Mel is promoted to Detective Sergeant.''\n\n''Featuring [[Richard McCabe]] as Karl Meerman, [[Sharon D.

Boyd initially suspects that the man's death may be due to the fact he was a conscientious objector in the Second World War, but the team suspect otherwise. When the body of a second victim, William Davies, is found in similar circumstances almost fifty-six years after the first murder, the trail of clues leads Grace to discover the unsolved murder of Norman Taylor that took place thirteen years after the first victim and follows the same ''modus operandi'' (MO) - a nine-inch nail through the head. Spence discovers that Taylor and Western were in the same regiment during the war, and that Davies was also a member of the same regiment, albeit under a different name. Realising that the killer is trying to pick off the survivors of the regiment one by one, Boyd and the team try to track down the survivors before they meet the same fate.\n\n''Featuring [[Michael Byrne (actor)|Michael Byrne]] as Joe Brackley, [[Geoffrey Bayldon]] as Edward Atkinson, [[Clive Wood]] as Neil Clayton, [[JJ Feild]] as Adam Western and [[Andi Osho]] as Policewoman.''\n | LineColor= 009FE9\n}}\n{{Episode list\n | EpisodeNumber=29\u201330\n | Title= False Flag\n | Aux1= [[Stephen Davis (screenwriter)|Stephen Davis]]\n | Aux2= [[Suri Krishnamma]]\n | OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2004|7|18|df=y}}<br>{{Start date|2004|7|19|df=y}}\n | Aux4= 8.11<br>7.95\n | ShortSummary= Boyd and his team face a race against time after a skeleton found in a condemned garage triggers a tragic chain of events. The skeleton is that of garage owner, Gerald Doyle, a student who was reported missing in 1981. An unexploded car bomb found at the scene points to terrorist activity as the cause of death. However, Doyle\u2019s parents produce a set of his diaries, which reveal that he was actually a mole for the intelligence services. The team begin to feel like they are being watched, and their fears are confirmed when they find unauthorised surveillance equipment in Boyd's car. As they discover their victim may have not have been as guilty as they once thought, a witness Boyd questioned as a part of the investigation commits suicide - leading them to find a link to an assassination.

Thirteen years since their disappearance, and the police are no closer to finding Cindy. Boyd uncovers evidence that Jason has been in contact with Cindy within the past six weeks, and thus realises that she must also still be alive. But when Jason disappears from hospital, the team are forced to spring into action and track him down - and discover how the twins were taken - and why. Meanwhile, Mel searches for her biological mother, and Spence makes use of his first job as an Inspector. As the team link the twins' disappearance to Dr. Roper, the man driving the car which hit Jason, they find him dead, after being stabbed repeatedly with a kitchen knife in his own home. They then unravel his past, and discover some dark secrets which could lead to two families being blown apart. As the team attempt to work out Cindy's identity, the race is on to try to find her.

However, Frankie remains unconvinced, and upon investigation, discovers the gun used was linked to two unsolved murders from the 1970s and 1980s. Now convinced that deputy manager Tim Denby did not kill himself, the investigation into the ownership of the gun gets underway. However, shortly before tests can begin, a masked man takes Frankie hostage in her lab and uses her to steal the gun out of her possession. The case becomes even more complicated when the gun is found to have been involved in nine separate contract killings. When the gun is used in the murder of local hotshot Phil Brown, the team suspect that his former hitman Sam Jacobs may be responsible, and that Denby's murder may have been the result of mistaken identity, with Brown having sent his gofer Mark Andrews to kill Jacobs, but then shooting the wrong man by accident, as he has trouble with his vision.\n\n''In this episode, the narration is done in a non-linear way.

Both victims had the word \"Sorry\" carved into their backs, were tied to a bed and then had semen poured over them, to perhaps signify that they were homosexuals. As the latest victim has a brother linked to organised crime, DSI Andy Bulmer and his team from NCIS are all over the case, and suspect that Barac's death may be related to his activities rather than the work of a serial killer. Boyd takes an instant dislike to Bulmer, but soon finds a bond with Bulmer's profiler, Greta. When Bulmer's right hand man, DS Dave Marvin, and Marvin's informant, Graham Penn, are both murdered in similar circumstances, Boyd suspects that the killings may be linked to a paedophile group grooming young girls, and that the perpetrator may be someone who was abused as a child. The case begins to unravel, however, when the man spotted at the scene of every crime arrives at the unit, and announces himself to be Greta's father.\n\n''The title of the episode is derived from [[Elton John]]'s song \"[[Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word]]\". \n\n''Featuring [[Phil Daniels]] as DSI Bulmer, [[Emma Fielding]] as Dr. Greta Simpson, [[Julian Glover]] as William Laurence, [[Phyllida Law]] as Mrs. Carstairs, [[James Dreyfus]] as Raymond Carstairs and [[Paul Reynolds (actor)|Paul Reynolds]] as DS Dave Marvin.''\n | LineColor= 009FE9\n}}\n{{Episode list\n | EpisodeNumber=37\u201338\n | Title= Shadowplay\n | Aux1= Ed Whitmore\n | Aux2= Andy Hay\n | OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2004|8|15|df=y}}<br>{{Start date|2004|8|16|df=y}}\n | Aux4= 8.35<br>8.55\n | ShortSummary= Boyd and the team are tasked with investigating the case of a young woman, with a history of psychiatric problems, who murders her family by setting the family home on fire, when the circumstances surrounding the incident are linked with a similar case from three years previously, in which both women claim they were told to commit the crimes by a mysterious character only known as 'The Shepherd'. Suspecting that the psychiatrist linked to the two woman may be the guilty party, Grace and Spence look into similar cases from the past five years, and discover that a third case, that of suicide victim Judy Walsh, is also linked to the same psychiatrist. Mel is keen to keep his name out of the investigation, mainly due to the fact she has fallen in love with him. But as the web of lies begins to unravel, The Shepherd's latest victim sees red, and sends Mel plummeting to her death. Ridden with guilt, Boyd re-evaluates the evidence, and discovers that the son of the original victims may hold the key to the entire case, but is it too late to save his latest conquest?

Boyd and the team's investigation of a shifty businessman leads them to uncover a pharmaceutical conspiracy involving fake drugs to treat AIDS.

The convict does make a revelation - but what he has to say causes the detective to re-examine the facts of the old case from every possible angle to assure himself of the man's guilt. Meanwhile, the detectives interview Stella Goodman, the latest applicant for Mel's job. Boyd is suspended from duty following a hit-and-run incident, but he claims he can't remember what happened. The rest of the cold case squad are convinced he's guilty though he was actually framed, but nevertheless continue to seek the truth in the Eddie Vine case.

The other corpse has been dead for far longer and it seems both murders could be the work of an unlikely suspect. The team are convinced Dr Nick Henderson is behind the murders, and Stella puts together damning evidence against him. However, before he can be arrested, he disappears without trace and his wife vanishes as well. The squad soon realise she could be the next victim and embark on a race against time to find her.

At the same time, Grace receives threats and a macabre package, a jar of pickled severed fingers. The team work out the identity of the killer, an old acquaintance of Tony Green's from prison who is harbouring a grudge against Grace. She decides to confront him personally, but gets more than she bargained for when she stumbles upon the kidnap victim. During the investigation, Spencer and Stella are seen building what appears to be an efficient working relationship. Spencer also sees some of his certainties about himself shaken up during one of the interviews and is obviously uncomfortable about it.

The team are forced to release Hunt from custody. Boyd arranges to have him followed to prevent any more murders, but the body of a girl soon turns up, drowned in the local swimming pool.

Eve discovers that the teenager is in fact Davy's brother, and that the events on the night of his death were linked to the ear. Meanwhile, Stella is attacked by a wayward dog at a woodland shrine where a mysterious nun, who seems to have stigmata, warns her to leave without collecting the evidence required. Boyd is suspicious of Sean Killigan, the contractor on whose construction site Davy's body was found and also the man who brought Joe to the hospital, and his wife Ester.

However, troubled by the appearance of a so-called journalist, Lisa Tobin, investigating the case, Grace does a little investigating of her own, and discovers that the journalist is none other that Catherine's biological daughter.

Attempting to track him down to discover how he knew about the buried corpse, Boyd discovers that not only is he unable to remember killing his parents, he has started taking [[LSD]] to try and remember who was responsible for the corpse in the garden. When the team talk to former patient Heather Hardiss, they discover that Lennon's doctor, Parke, took all of the patients out of the mental institution in 1967 and instead treated them in a hippy squat, which happens to be the exact same house where the body was found in the garden. Suspecting that Lennon may be trying to unearth Parke as the killer, Boyd follows Lennon on his quest to discover what really happened that night, and who the real killer is. The team is shaken early in the episode when Grace quits after a severe row with Boyd.

Tracking down the file, he discovers that the case is that of a young girl found stabbed to death on an East London street in May 1945. Boyd discovers that the last person to look at the file was his former colleague Mel Silver, two weeks before her death, and that the pendant sent to Mel after her death belonged to the young girl in question. Discovering that the dagger is in fact the murder weapon, Boyd finds out that it was found by two Polish builders working for the Dusniak family, who then took it to a dealer who is subsequently murdered. After a Mossad agent becomes actively involved in the case, Boyd progressively realizes that the Dusniak family may not be who they claim to be. The family's solicitor, Dennis Holland, admits to Boyd that the head of the family, Abigail forced him to witness her father, Marek, signing over powers of attorney to her, shortly before his death by suicide with a cyanide pill. And when Abigail's grandson, Ben, disappears from the local Synagogue, new revelations link the case to some of the darkest events of 65 years before.\n\n''[[Claire Goose]] as Detective Sergeant Mel Silver appears in flashback sequences (actually footage from the Series 4 episode \"Shadowplay\").''\n\n''Featuring [[Michelle Forbes]] as Sarah, [[Eileen Atkins]] as Abigail Dusniak, [[Pip Torrens]] as Dennis Hollandand, [[Jim Norton (Irish actor)|Jim Norton]] as David Dusniak and [[Bo Poraj]] as Viktor Cyrak.''  \n |LineColor=EBD704\n}}\n|}\n\n===Series 7 (2008)===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|- style=\"color:#ffffff;\"\n! style=\"background:#43C210;\"| Episode\n! style=\"background:#43C210;\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#43C210;\"| Directed by\n! style=\"background:#43C210;\"| Written by\n! style=\"background:#43C210;\"| Original airdate\n! style=\"background:#43C210;\"| Viewers<br>(millions)<ref name=\"barb.co.uk\"/>\n{{Episode list\n | EpisodeNumber=63\u201364\n | Title= Missing Persons\n | Aux1= [[Tim Fywell]]\n | Aux2= Declan Croghan \n | OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2008|4|14|df=y}}<br>{{Start date|2008|4|15|df=y}}\n | Aux4= 7.19<br>7.12\n | ShortSummary= When the investigation into a woman defending her daughter from a mugger throws up a link to an unsolved murder from 1993, Boyd and the team investigate. Evidence of a video cassette at the scene leads them to suspect a case involving prostitution, sexual violence and [[snuff movie]]s, but when the DNA of the woman defending her daughter turns out to belong to Lore Dutana, a Basque national with links to [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]], Boyd suspects that he has unearthed the remains of a terrorist cell. And when Lore goes on the run, the team unearth even more secrets, including links to an Algerian pimp known as BB, who may not exactly be who he says he is. However, little does Lore suspect that one of her old allies, Una Doyle, is out for revenge, and that her children are in danger. As the mystery begins to reveal itself, stories of terrorist organisations training together at an army camp in Libya proves to be the link between the victim, Lore and Una. Boyd attempts to smoke out Una and discover the real truth about what happened that night, and who is responsible for the unsolved 1993 death. In this episode, Boyd finds his son, Luke, in a secure mental unit.

At the time, two initial suspects, Michael Kelleher and Terry Ryan, were questioned, after spending time under Reading in prison. However, they had straight alibis for the night of his death, and no evidence was found at the scene to connect them to the case. It soon transpires that Reading was beating and sexually abusing some of his seriously ill inmates, but before Boyd can get to Michael Kelleher, he escapes on a routine visit to hospital, and then, with the help of his old adversary, kidnaps the prison psychiatrist, who he believes is responsible for the disappearance of six former inmates after they were released. On the trail of Kelleher, Eve finds the burial site of the six bodies, as well as the freshly buried body of Kelleher's friend, Ryan. When Boyd discovers the true identity of the killer, he races to the seaside in the hope of finding the prison doctor.

Initially, the team suspect the victim to be Francis Duggan, a soldier who disappeared six months after his tour of duty in Iraq and has never been seen since. However, medical records prove that Duggan is not the victim, and for long, Duggan re-appears to attend to his terminally ill mother. New evidence shows the victim to be Mark Bennett, a soldier with a grievance, after his corporal slept with his girlfriend behind his back. The team also find out about the possible involvement of a [[Academi|Blackwater-like]] British security firm led by a retired Colonel. The night of the regimental dinner proves to be the key in the entire investigation, but it soon transpires that Bennett had bigger fish to fry than his corporal. And when a woman from Iraq turns up, wanting to prove that the soldiers were working for an Iraqi war-lord who had her son killed, the real truth behind Bennett's beef begins to come to light. After  Duggan is shot dead to prevent him from talking, Boyd discovers the real suspect for Mark Bennett's murder.

The man is soon identified as George Andrews, a neo-Nazi skinhead who was a member of the local right wing activist group alongside thug leader Jim Brown. Eve discovers a picture of a man was shoved down his throat shortly before his death, and the photo is identified as Charles Aniyeke, the only victim of a hospice fire in 1990 from which he was unable to escape. Boyd soon discovers that Andrews was in fact Sam Cohen, Aniyeke's lover, who was not an actual neo-Nazi, but infiltrated the gang in order to get the evidence - a video tape - of the gang killing Aniyeke. However, the investigation takes an unexpected turn when Brown kidnaps a young Muslim who has been having an affair with his daughter. The team are forced to race against time to find the location of the missing boy, while also having to discover the reason why every single member of the neo-Nazi gang is going to die from AIDS.

Boyd believes the case may be linked to a number of protests which occurred the year before, as the protestors regularly used the tunnels to sleep or camp in. However, Grace suspects that Deardon's death may be a ritualistic killing, a fact which Boyd is sceptical of at first. When the three friends from Deardon's pub quiz team, the Awkward Squad, are all sent letters with the words 'time to pay' on the front, they all start to remember the tragic events that occurred that night, and begin hallucinating and seeing Deardon's ghost. When two of the three men, Josh Findlay and Harold Bloom, die of heart attacks after having convulsions, the third man is forced to come clean about what really happened, which forces Deardon's son to resent one of his idols.

Eve takes a particularly personal interest in the case, having excavated mass graves in the region, and having discovered the body of the victim herself. The key to the road traffic accident is discovered to be the homeless girl who questioned Boyd in \"Missing Persons\", and who happens to have known Luke when he was living on the streets. During the first part of the episode, it becomes clear that neither Boyd nor Eve have informed the rest of the team of Luke's death. Boyd cannot even deal with the funeral arrangements, leaving Eve to sort it out with the mortuary, which proves too much of a burden for her. When Eve manages to identify the contents of a stolen handbag, the team stumble upon a hospital laboratory worker, Anna, using the laboratory to store pure samples of heroin, to be used in a major drug deal. However, the two men she is working with lose their cool when Boyd and the team come hot on their tail and use Anna as bait to allow themselves some time, and get to their real target - a North London cafe owner whose activities during the Balkans War are somewhat questionable. When both suspects are hauled in, it is a simple matter of uncovering who is responsible for the murder of the mother and child found in the mass grave. The unravelling of the case prompts Boyd to deal with his own grief and he is last seen claiming Luke's body from the mortuary.\n\n''Featuring [[Sean Harris]] as Radovan Sredinic, [[Jacek Koman]] as Max Fowler / Jovan Petropecic, [[Anna Madeley]] as Anna Vaspovic, [[Ron Cook]] as Dr. Milan Vaspovic and [[Branka Kati\u0107]] as Jasni Vaspovic.''\n | LineColor=43C210\n}}\n|}\n\n===Series 8 (2009)===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|- style=\"color:#ffffff;\"\n! style=\"background:#260A45;\"| Episode\n! style=\"background:#260A45;\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#260A45;\"| Directed by \n! style=\"background:#260A45;\"| Written by\n! style=\"background:#260A45;\"| Original airdate\n! style=\"background:#260A45;\"| Viewers<br />(millions)<ref name=\"barb.co.uk\"/>\n{{Episode list\n | EpisodeNumber=75\u201376\n | Title= Magdalene 26\n | Aux1=Andy Hay<ref name=\"8.01\">{{cite web|url=http://www.locatetv.com/tv/waking-the-dead/season-8/6441836|title=LocateTV.com Is Closed|publisher=locatetv.com|accessdate=7 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722203659/http://www.locatetv.com/tv/waking-the-dead/season-8/6441836|archive-date=22 July 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n | Aux2=Declan Croghan<ref name=\"8.01\"/> \n | OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2009|9|6|df=y}}<br>{{Start date|2009|9|7|df=y}}\n | Aux4=6.86<br>6.99\n | ShortSummary= A naked woman is found wandering through woodland with no recollection of how she got there, but Boyd is more concerned that her DNA has flagged up as appearing at a murder scene in a Soho brothel in 1967.

Boyd unravels a plot which involves the woman's business partner, attempting to reclaim six million pounds he lost in a dodgy stock deal, and three Turkish men, who originally invested the money and now want it back. However, a more pressing matter comes to hand, when it is discovered that the woman has an identical twin, and that the Turkish men have kidnapped her by mistake. When it is discovered that the twin was actually the one present in the brothel, the entire story begins to piece itself together.

However, his outlandish techniques and open DNA searches allow him to pinpoint a suspect, Jason Bloch, from whom he illegally takes a DNA sample, in order to prove Bloch was one of Gemma's rapists. Bloch refuses to identify his accomplice, so it is once more up to Boyd to use some cunning tactics and old-school methods in order to flush out the other culprit.

After discovering that a similar disappearance took place twenty five-years ago - that of a nine-year-old boy David Drew - and after the sudden death of the doctor, Boyd suspects that Claire's death has seemingly unleashed a predator - The Bag Man - straight from her childhood nightmare.\n\n''Featuring [[Alice Krige]] as Karen Harding, [[Anna Hope]] as Claire Somers, [[Philip Wright (actor)|Philip Wright]] <ref name=\"amandahowardassociates\">{{cite web|url=http://www.amandahowardassociates.co.uk/actors/actor.php?client=philip-wright|title=AHA &#124; Philip Wright|publisher=amandahowardassociates.co.uk|accessdate=7 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325220139/http://www.amandahowardassociates.co.uk/actors/actor.php?client=philip-wright|archive-date=25 March 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> as Peter Broading and [[Georgina Rich]] as Teresa Harding.''\n | LineColor=A92236\n}}\n{{Episode list\n | EpisodeNumber=87\u201388\n | Title= Solidarity\n | Aux1=Andy Hay<ref name=\"9.05\"/>\n | Aux2=Ed Whitmore<ref name=\"9.05\">http://www.tvtv.co.uk/tvtv/web/programdetails.vm?programmeId=53920252&lang=en&epgView=list&groupid=0&tref=Search{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n | OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2011|3|27|df=y}}<br> {{Start date|2011|3|28|df=y}}\n | Aux4=6.72<br>6.55\n | ShortSummary= The remains of missing political activist Piers Kennedy are found in a wall beneath London's sewer system, leading the team to re-open the case.

The trouble is, however, of the four people involved with the hijack, two are already dead - Piers and one of his college associates, Hugo Christie - and the killer is on the look-out for the third perpetrator, Hugo's sister, Lucy.

Unable to understand why his DNA had never been entered into the database, and the even weirder fact that his body had been cremated just two weeks after it was found, Sarah discovers that Karl had been on a watchlist as a possible national threat, following the 7/7 bombings in London, and the fact that his mother reported him to the authorities following his conversion to Islam after he fell in love with a Muslim girl, Naz. Suspecting that he may have been part of a terrorist cell, Boyd discovers that his peers have taken false identities, meaning that not even Karl knew exactly who he was dealing with. Discovering that Naz was actually an informant for the secret services, on the request of fellow lover Mohammed, Boyd uncovers what really happened on the night of Karl's death. But the security services are determined to prevent Boyd from blowing the whistle, and hatch a dangerous plan to take him out.

Angered by the decision, he decides his last case at the unit will be re-investigating his very first - the disappearance of sixteen homeless boys from the Waterloo Bridge area between 1979 and 1982. Although he had not managed to make any headway the first time round, a search of records of unidentified bodies finds a match to one of the missing boys, Pele. And further investigation leads the team directly to a torture chamber just south of the M11. However, when Eve discovers evidence that relates to another murder, Boyd finds himself entangled in a chain of events involving a prisoner being beaten to death, the killing of three police officers, the death of the sixteen boys and an Assistant Commissioner trying to protect the killer.

Although the case was deemed cold at the time, Boyd's second investigation leads to a surprise turn of events, spurring the killer out of hiding, and forcing him to abduct a second girl, Jodie Whitemore. Realising that his actions have resulted in the girl's abduction, Boyd is forced to play catch-up as the killer sends him information regarding the girl's whereabouts. Boyd has Alice Miller's body exhumed, hoping that new DNA tests may reveal the killer's true identity, and provide clues as to the location of the missing girl, Jodie. However, the killer is keen to kill again, and it's a race against time for Boyd to save the missing girl. When the team pinpoint the girl's location, they use Mel as bait to lure the killer out. However, their plan soon backfires, when Boyd discovers that the kidnapper is looking for more than money - he wants revenge on Boyd's team - and Mel is in danger.\n\n''During this episode, we see Boyd with his wife and two-year-old son, who are never seen again in later episodes. They were written out in favour of a totally different storyline after the pilot. The opening scene of \"Burn Out\" explicitly shows that Boyd had a son who has vanished years before and would have been 25 in the timeframe of the episode. The whole story of Boyd's (presumably) dead son is told in the second part of \"Blind Beggar\". Storylines about abused, missing or dead children remained a recurring theme in the series throughout the nine series.

Boyd later discovers that Marina's father died in a car accident a few years previously in the same street, and that Marina refuses to accept that his death was simply an accident. Boyd is intrigued, and reluctantly agrees to investigate. Frankie performs forensic tests on Marina's father's car, and proves that he was still alive after the crash, and could have easily escaped. However, the answers they uncover may mean that the danger to Marina is much greater than any of them had thought possible. Boyd has Marina's uncle, Mike Coleman, and her mother, Gwen, brought in for questioning, while Frankie searches their house.

However, an unusual piece of evidence - a message in Braille buried with the corpse, turns out to be a passage from one of St. Paul's letters to the Corinthians and proves to be a vital clue in identifying both the victim, and the killer. As the team suspect that the body was never meant to be discovered, the hunt continues for the murderer, until former church reverend Father Stuart is brutually murdered in similar circumstances.

The problem is, the list of suspects fails to help narrow down the identity of the killer. At the time of her death, she was being stalked by an obsessive whom she had met online, was struggling with an ex-husband who didn't want to let her go, and was also being harassed by the father of her unborn child. When the stalker confesses to killing her, Grace isn't entirely convinced he is telling the truth. Matters take a turn for the worse when the stalker's body is found nailed to a bridge over a river.

However, the investigation takes a rather abrupt turn when Frankie discovers that Newman did not die of natural causes - and was murdered in such a way as to make it look so. The team soon realize there is a lot more to Newman than they first imagined. Added to all that, there is a link to a famous fifties trial as a result of which, a gangster was hanged for killing two policemen.

But was it real? Further renovation works at the house reveal three more bodies buried within, and a dark day for Spencer, who used to live in the house as a child with his mother and father. The identity of the victims reveal that the film's content may not be so fictional after all. And when Spencer looks into his family history, he discovers that his father may be linked to the mysterious men involved. Just as Boyd believes he has cracked the case, the gangster responsible for the bodies behind the walls decides it's time to avenge old wounds, and the unearthing of past events provokes more murders and an international turf war between old rivals. As events start to become even more complicated, Boyd realises that Spencer's family history is the key to unravelling the mystery, and Spencer is forced to confront his mother and discover the truth about the reason his father left.\n\n''In the opening sequence of this story's first episode, Mel is promoted to Detective Sergeant.''\n\n''Featuring [[Richard McCabe]] as Karl Meerman, [[Sharon D.

Boyd initially suspects that the man's death may be due to the fact he was a conscientious objector in the Second World War, but the team suspect otherwise. When the body of a second victim, William Davies, is found in similar circumstances almost fifty-six years after the first murder, the trail of clues leads Grace to discover the unsolved murder of Norman Taylor that took place thirteen years after the first victim and follows the same ''modus operandi'' (MO) - a nine-inch nail through the head. Spence discovers that Taylor and Western were in the same regiment during the war, and that Davies was also a member of the same regiment, albeit under a different name. Realising that the killer is trying to pick off the survivors of the regiment one by one, Boyd and the team try to track down the survivors before they meet the same fate.\n\n''Featuring [[Michael Byrne (actor)|Michael Byrne]] as Joe Brackley, [[Geoffrey Bayldon]] as Edward Atkinson, [[Clive Wood]] as Neil Clayton, [[JJ Feild]] as Adam Western and [[Andi Osho]] as Policewoman.''\n | LineColor= 009FE9\n}}\n{{Episode list\n | EpisodeNumber=29\u201330\n | Title= False Flag\n | Aux1= [[Stephen Davis (screenwriter)|Stephen Davis]]\n | Aux2= [[Suri Krishnamma]]\n | OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2004|7|18|df=y}}<br>{{Start date|2004|7|19|df=y}}\n | Aux4= 8.11<br>7.95\n | ShortSummary= Boyd and his team face a race against time after a skeleton found in a condemned garage triggers a tragic chain of events. The skeleton is that of garage owner, Gerald Doyle, a student who was reported missing in 1981. An unexploded car bomb found at the scene points to terrorist activity as the cause of death. However, Doyle\u2019s parents produce a set of his diaries, which reveal that he was actually a mole for the intelligence services. The team begin to feel like they are being watched, and their fears are confirmed when they find unauthorised surveillance equipment in Boyd's car. As they discover their victim may have not have been as guilty as they once thought, a witness Boyd questioned as a part of the investigation commits suicide - leading them to find a link to an assassination.

Thirteen years since their disappearance, and the police are no closer to finding Cindy. Boyd uncovers evidence that Jason has been in contact with Cindy within the past six weeks, and thus realises that she must also still be alive. But when Jason disappears from hospital, the team are forced to spring into action and track him down - and discover how the twins were taken - and why. Meanwhile, Mel searches for her biological mother, and Spence makes use of his first job as an Inspector. As the team link the twins' disappearance to Dr. Roper, the man driving the car which hit Jason, they find him dead, after being stabbed repeatedly with a kitchen knife in his own home. They then unravel his past, and discover some dark secrets which could lead to two families being blown apart. As the team attempt to work out Cindy's identity, the race is on to try to find her.

However, Frankie remains unconvinced, and upon investigation, discovers the gun used was linked to two unsolved murders from the 1970s and 1980s. Now convinced that deputy manager Tim Denby did not kill himself, the investigation into the ownership of the gun gets underway. However, shortly before tests can begin, a masked man takes Frankie hostage in her lab and uses her to steal the gun out of her possession. The case becomes even more complicated when the gun is found to have been involved in nine separate contract killings. When the gun is used in the murder of local hotshot Phil Brown, the team suspect that his former hitman Sam Jacobs may be responsible, and that Denby's murder may have been the result of mistaken identity, with Brown having sent his gofer Mark Andrews to kill Jacobs, but then shooting the wrong man by accident, as he has trouble with his vision.\n\n''In this episode, the narration is done in a non-linear way.

Both victims had the word \"Sorry\" carved into their backs, were tied to a bed and then had semen poured over them, to perhaps signify that they were homosexuals. As the latest victim has a brother linked to organised crime, DSI Andy Bulmer and his team from NCIS are all over the case, and suspect that Barac's death may be related to his activities rather than the work of a serial killer. Boyd takes an instant dislike to Bulmer, but soon finds a bond with Bulmer's profiler, Greta. When Bulmer's right hand man, DS Dave Marvin, and Marvin's informant, Graham Penn, are both murdered in similar circumstances, Boyd suspects that the killings may be linked to a paedophile group grooming young girls, and that the perpetrator may be someone who was abused as a child. The case begins to unravel, however, when the man spotted at the scene of every crime arrives at the unit, and announces himself to be Greta's father.\n\n''The title of the episode is derived from [[Elton John]]'s song \"[[Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word]]\". \n\n''Featuring [[Phil Daniels]] as DSI Bulmer, [[Emma Fielding]] as Dr. Greta Simpson, [[Julian Glover]] as William Laurence, [[Phyllida Law]] as Mrs. Carstairs, [[James Dreyfus]] as Raymond Carstairs and [[Paul Reynolds (actor)|Paul Reynolds]] as DS Dave Marvin.''\n | LineColor= 009FE9\n}}\n{{Episode list\n | EpisodeNumber=37\u201338\n | Title= Shadowplay\n | Aux1= Ed Whitmore\n | Aux2= Andy Hay\n | OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2004|8|15|df=y}}<br>{{Start date|2004|8|16|df=y}}\n | Aux4= 8.35<br>8.55\n | ShortSummary= Boyd and the team are tasked with investigating the case of a young woman, with a history of psychiatric problems, who murders her family by setting the family home on fire, when the circumstances surrounding the incident are linked with a similar case from three years previously, in which both women claim they were told to commit the crimes by a mysterious character only known as 'The Shepherd'. Suspecting that the psychiatrist linked to the two woman may be the guilty party, Grace and Spence look into similar cases from the past five years, and discover that a third case, that of suicide victim Judy Walsh, is also linked to the same psychiatrist. Mel is keen to keep his name out of the investigation, mainly due to the fact she has fallen in love with him. But as the web of lies begins to unravel, The Shepherd's latest victim sees red, and sends Mel plummeting to her death. Ridden with guilt, Boyd re-evaluates the evidence, and discovers that the son of the original victims may hold the key to the entire case, but is it too late to save his latest conquest?

Boyd and the team's investigation of a shifty businessman leads them to uncover a pharmaceutical conspiracy involving fake drugs to treat AIDS.

The convict does make a revelation - but what he has to say causes the detective to re-examine the facts of the old case from every possible angle to assure himself of the man's guilt. Meanwhile, the detectives interview Stella Goodman, the latest applicant for Mel's job. Boyd is suspended from duty following a hit-and-run incident, but he claims he can't remember what happened. The rest of the cold case squad are convinced he's guilty though he was actually framed, but nevertheless continue to seek the truth in the Eddie Vine case.

The other corpse has been dead for far longer and it seems both murders could be the work of an unlikely suspect. The team are convinced Dr Nick Henderson is behind the murders, and Stella puts together damning evidence against him. However, before he can be arrested, he disappears without trace and his wife vanishes as well. The squad soon realise she could be the next victim and embark on a race against time to find her.

At the same time, Grace receives threats and a macabre package, a jar of pickled severed fingers. The team work out the identity of the killer, an old acquaintance of Tony Green's from prison who is harbouring a grudge against Grace. She decides to confront him personally, but gets more than she bargained for when she stumbles upon the kidnap victim. During the investigation, Spencer and Stella are seen building what appears to be an efficient working relationship. Spencer also sees some of his certainties about himself shaken up during one of the interviews and is obviously uncomfortable about it.

The team are forced to release Hunt from custody. Boyd arranges to have him followed to prevent any more murders, but the body of a girl soon turns up, drowned in the local swimming pool. Boyd takes a personal interest in the case and gradually loses control of his actions. He ultimately leaks the suspect's name to a journalist hoping to uncover more information.

Eve discovers that the teenager is in fact Davy's brother, and that the events on the night of his death were linked to the ear. Meanwhile, Stella is attacked by a wayward dog at a woodland shrine where a mysterious nun, who seems to have stigmata, warns her to leave without collecting the evidence required. Boyd is suspicious of Sean Killigan, the contractor on whose construction site Davy's body was found and also the man who brought Joe to the hospital, and his wife Ester. Joe awakes from his coma to hear Davy is dead, unaware that after the fight on the night of his death, someone else had decided to go after Davy.

Boyd is relieved when Ahmed comes off hunger strike, on the instruction of his daughter, but soon becomes startled by the number of false alarms in finding the missing Mahdi skull.

However, troubled by the appearance of a so-called journalist, Lisa Tobin, investigating the case, Grace does a little investigating of her own, and discovers that the journalist is none other that Catherine's biological daughter.

However, on the same day, the wallets of three murder victims from the past are sent anonymously to the wife of one of the victims. Jenson was the prime suspect at the time of the three murders, but was deemed mentally unfit to stand trial, and was instead committed to the psychiatric unit. The teams investigation leads them to discover a systematic scheme of abuse in a care home during the 1970s and 1980s, and pinpoints the connection between the three victims that was originally unidentified at the time of the original investigation. The first victim, Harry Valentine, was the housemaster who regularly beat the children, a fact which care home owner Bruno Rivelli claims to know nothing about. The second, Dr. Reilly, was a physician who treated the injuries caused by Valentine, but failed to report the cause.

They discover that Daniel was committed to a mental institution after killing both of his parents, but his psychiatrist suspects he is cutting adrift and becoming something new. Attempting to track him down to discover how he knew about the buried corpse, Boyd discovers that not only is he unable to remember killing his parents, he has started taking [[LSD]] to try and remember who was responsible for the corpse in the garden. When the team talk to former patient Heather Hardiss, they discover that Lennon's doctor, Parke, took all of the patients out of the mental institution in 1967 and instead treated them in a hippy squat, which happens to be the exact same house where the body was found in the garden. Suspecting that Lennon may be trying to unearth Parke as the killer, Boyd follows Lennon on his quest to discover what really happened that night, and who the real killer is. The team is shaken early in the episode when Grace quits after a severe row with Boyd.

Tracking down the file, he discovers that the case is that of a young girl found stabbed to death on an East London street in May 1945. Boyd discovers that the last person to look at the file was his former colleague Mel Silver, two weeks before her death, and that the pendant sent to Mel after her death belonged to the young girl in question. Discovering that the dagger is in fact the murder weapon, Boyd finds out that it was found by two Polish builders working for the Dusniak family, who then took it to a dealer who is subsequently murdered. After a Mossad agent becomes actively involved in the case, Boyd progressively realizes that the Dusniak family may not be who they claim to be. The family's solicitor, Dennis Holland, admits to Boyd that the head of the family, Abigail forced him to witness her father, Marek, signing over powers of attorney to her, shortly before his death by suicide with a cyanide pill. And when Abigail's grandson, Ben, disappears from the local Synagogue, new revelations link the case to some of the darkest events of 65 years before.\n\n''[[Claire Goose]] as Detective Sergeant Mel Silver appears in flashback sequences (actually footage from the Series 4 episode \"Shadowplay\").''\n\n''Featuring [[Michelle Forbes]] as Sarah, [[Eileen Atkins]] as Abigail Dusniak, [[Pip Torrens]] as Dennis Hollandand, [[Jim Norton (Irish actor)|Jim Norton]] as David Dusniak and [[Bo Poraj]] as Viktor Cyrak.''  \n |LineColor=EBD704\n}}\n|}\n\n===Series 7 (2008)===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|- style=\"color:#ffffff;\"\n! style=\"background:#43C210;\"| Episode\n! style=\"background:#43C210;\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#43C210;\"| Directed by\n! style=\"background:#43C210;\"| Written by\n! style=\"background:#43C210;\"| Original airdate\n! style=\"background:#43C210;\"| Viewers<br>(millions)<ref name=\"barb.co.uk\"/>\n{{Episode list\n | EpisodeNumber=63\u201364\n | Title= Missing Persons\n | Aux1= [[Tim Fywell]]\n | Aux2= Declan Croghan \n | OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2008|4|14|df=y}}<br>{{Start date|2008|4|15|df=y}}\n | Aux4= 7.19<br>7.12\n | ShortSummary= When the investigation into a woman defending her daughter from a mugger throws up a link to an unsolved murder from 1993, Boyd and the team investigate. Evidence of a video cassette at the scene leads them to suspect a case involving prostitution, sexual violence and [[snuff movie]]s, but when the DNA of the woman defending her daughter turns out to belong to Lore Dutana, a Basque national with links to [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]], Boyd suspects that he has unearthed the remains of a terrorist cell. And when Lore goes on the run, the team unearth even more secrets, including links to an Algerian pimp known as BB, who may not exactly be who he says he is. However, little does Lore suspect that one of her old allies, Una Doyle, is out for revenge, and that her children are in danger. As the mystery begins to reveal itself, stories of terrorist organisations training together at an army camp in Libya proves to be the link between the victim, Lore and Una. Boyd attempts to smoke out Una and discover the real truth about what happened that night, and who is responsible for the unsolved 1993 death.

At the time, two initial suspects, Michael Kelleher and Terry Ryan, were questioned, after spending time under Reading in prison. However, they had straight alibis for the night of his death, and no evidence was found at the scene to connect them to the case. It soon transpires that Reading was beating and sexually abusing some of his seriously ill inmates, but before Boyd can get to Michael Kelleher, he escapes on a routine visit to hospital, and then, with the help of his old adversary, kidnaps the prison psychiatrist, who he believes is responsible for the disappearance of six former inmates after they were released. On the trail of Kelleher, Eve finds the burial site of the six bodies, as well as the freshly buried body of Kelleher's friend, Ryan. When Boyd discovers the true identity of the killer, he races to the seaside in the hope of finding the prison doctor.

Initially, the team suspect the victim to be Francis Duggan, a soldier who disappeared six months after his tour of duty in Iraq and has never been seen since. However, medical records prove that Duggan is not the victim, and for long, Duggan re-appears to attend to his terminally ill mother. New evidence shows the victim to be Mark Bennett, a soldier with a grievance, after his corporal slept with his girlfriend behind his back. The team also find out about the possible involvement of a [[Academi|Blackwater-like]] British security firm led by a retired Colonel. The night of the regimental dinner proves to be the key in the entire investigation, but it soon transpires that Bennett had bigger fish to fry than his corporal. And when a woman from Iraq turns up, wanting to prove that the soldiers were working for an Iraqi war-lord who had her son killed, the real truth behind Bennett's beef begins to come to light. After  Duggan is shot dead to prevent him from talking, Boyd discovers the real suspect for Mark Bennett's murder.

The man is soon identified as George Andrews, a neo-Nazi skinhead who was a member of the local right wing activist group alongside thug leader Jim Brown. Eve discovers a picture of a man was shoved down his throat shortly before his death, and the photo is identified as Charles Aniyeke, the only victim of a hospice fire in 1990 from which he was unable to escape. Boyd soon discovers that Andrews was in fact Sam Cohen, Aniyeke's lover, who was not an actual neo-Nazi, but infiltrated the gang in order to get the evidence - a video tape - of the gang killing Aniyeke. However, the investigation takes an unexpected turn when Brown kidnaps a young Muslim who has been having an affair with his daughter. The team are forced to race against time to find the location of the missing boy, while also having to discover the reason why every single member of the neo-Nazi gang is going to die from AIDS.

Boyd believes the case may be linked to a number of protests which occurred the year before, as the protestors regularly used the tunnels to sleep or camp in. However, Grace suspects that Deardon's death may be a ritualistic killing, a fact which Boyd is sceptical of at first. When the three friends from Deardon's pub quiz team, the Awkward Squad, are all sent letters with the words 'time to pay' on the front, they all start to remember the tragic events that occurred that night, and begin hallucinating and seeing Deardon's ghost. When two of the three men, Josh Findlay and Harold Bloom, die of heart attacks after having convulsions, the third man is forced to come clean about what really happened, which forces Deardon's son to resent one of his idols.

Eve takes a particularly personal interest in the case, having excavated mass graves in the region, and having discovered the body of the victim herself. The key to the road traffic accident is discovered to be the homeless girl who questioned Boyd in \"Missing Persons\", and who happens to have known Luke when he was living on the streets. During the first part of the episode, it becomes clear that neither Boyd nor Eve have informed the rest of the team of Luke's death. Boyd cannot even deal with the funeral arrangements, leaving Eve to sort it out with the mortuary, which proves too much of a burden for her. When Eve manages to identify the contents of a stolen handbag, the team stumble upon a hospital laboratory worker, Anna, using the laboratory to store pure samples of heroin, to be used in a major drug deal. However, the two men she is working with lose their cool when Boyd and the team come hot on their tail and use Anna as bait to allow themselves some time, and get to their real target - a North London cafe owner whose activities during the Balkans War are somewhat questionable. When both suspects are hauled in, it is a simple matter of uncovering who is responsible for the murder of the mother and child found in the mass grave. The unravelling of the case prompts Boyd to deal with his own grief and he is last seen claiming Luke's body from the mortuary.\n\n''Featuring [[Sean Harris]] as Radovan Sredinic, [[Jacek Koman]] as Max Fowler / Jovan Petropecic, [[Anna Madeley]] as Anna Vaspovic, [[Ron Cook]] as Dr. Milan Vaspovic and [[Branka Kati\u0107]] as Jasni Vaspovic.''\n | LineColor=43C210\n}}\n|}\n\n===Series 8 (2009)===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|- style=\"color:#ffffff;\"\n! style=\"background:#260A45;\"| Episode\n! style=\"background:#260A45;\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#260A45;\"| Directed by \n! style=\"background:#260A45;\"| Written by\n! style=\"background:#260A45;\"| Original airdate\n! style=\"background:#260A45;\"| Viewers<br />(millions)<ref name=\"barb.co.uk\"/>\n{{Episode list\n | EpisodeNumber=75\u201376\n | Title= Magdalene 26\n | Aux1=Andy Hay<ref name=\"8.01\">{{cite web|url=http://www.locatetv.com/tv/waking-the-dead/season-8/6441836|title=LocateTV.com Is Closed|publisher=locatetv.com|accessdate=7 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722203659/http://www.locatetv.com/tv/waking-the-dead/season-8/6441836|archive-date=22 July 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n | Aux2=Declan Croghan<ref name=\"8.01\"/> \n | OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2009|9|6|df=y}}<br>{{Start date|2009|9|7|df=y}}\n | Aux4=6.86<br>6.99\n | ShortSummary= A naked woman is found wandering through woodland with no recollection of how she got there, but Boyd is more concerned that her DNA has flagged up as appearing at a murder scene in a Soho brothel in 1967.

Boyd unravels a plot which involves the woman's business partner, attempting to reclaim six million pounds he lost in a dodgy stock deal, and three Turkish men, who originally invested the money and now want it back. However, a more pressing matter comes to hand, when it is discovered that the woman has an identical twin, and that the Turkish men have kidnapped her by mistake. When it is discovered that the twin was actually the one present in the brothel, the entire story begins to piece itself together.

However, his outlandish techniques and open DNA searches allow him to pinpoint a suspect, Jason Bloch, from whom he illegally takes a DNA sample, in order to prove Bloch was one of Gemma's rapists. Bloch refuses to identify his accomplice, so it is once more up to Boyd to use some cunning tactics and old-school methods in order to flush out the other culprit.

As the investigation into how or when the girl was kidnapped gets underway, the team discover that shortly before her death, Claire visited a local private clinic in order to obtain some pills to help her with depression. When it is discovered that the doctor of the clinic is in fact the sister of the abducted girl, the puzzle begins to piece together, but CCTV footage spurs Grace into believing that she also had a connection to the doctor in question. After discovering that a similar disappearance took place twenty five-years ago - that of a nine-year-old boy David Drew - and after the sudden death of the doctor, Boyd suspects that Claire's death has seemingly unleashed a predator - The Bag Man - straight from her childhood nightmare.\n\n''Featuring [[Alice Krige]] as Karen Harding, [[Anna Hope]] as Claire Somers, [[Philip Wright (actor)|Philip Wright]] <ref name=\"amandahowardassociates\">{{cite web|url=http://www.amandahowardassociates.co.uk/actors/actor.php?client=philip-wright|title=AHA &#124; Philip Wright|publisher=amandahowardassociates.co.uk|accessdate=7 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325220139/http://www.amandahowardassociates.co.uk/actors/actor.php?client=philip-wright|archive-date=25 March 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> as Peter Broading and [[Georgina Rich]] as Teresa Harding.''\n | LineColor=A92236\n}}\n{{Episode list\n | EpisodeNumber=87\u201388\n | Title= Solidarity\n | Aux1=Andy Hay<ref name=\"9.05\"/>\n | Aux2=Ed Whitmore<ref name=\"9.05\">http://www.tvtv.co.uk/tvtv/web/programdetails.vm?programmeId=53920252&lang=en&epgView=list&groupid=0&tref=Search{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n | OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2011|3|27|df=y}}<br> {{Start date|2011|3|28|df=y}}\n | Aux4=6.72<br>6.55\n | ShortSummary= The remains of missing political activist Piers Kennedy are found in a wall beneath London's sewer system, leading the team to re-open the case. They discover that Piers was a former marine, who after retiring from duty, discovered he was suffering from a terminal bone marrow disease, leading his last act to be to infiltrate a peace movement against nuclear weapons and trying to discredit it by hijacking a nuclear convoy on a deserted country lane one night in 1983. The trouble is, however, of the four people involved with the hijack, two are already dead - Piers and one of his college associates, Hugo Christie - and the killer is on the look-out for the third perpetrator, Hugo's sister, Lucy. Discovering that the entire case may be built around the fact that the other perpetrator, Murray Stuart, who murdered an MOD policeman at the scene, has a videotape of the entire incident. The problem is, however, that Murray and Grace were lovers back in the day, forcing Boyd to use Grace as bait to lure Murray out of hiding, and discover the truth behind Piers' brutal murder.\n\n''Featuring [[Adam Rayner]] as Piers Kennedy, [[Frances Tomelty]] as MI5 Agent Jane Hussey, [[Anna Chancellor]] as Lucy Christie, [[John Shrapnel]] as John Christie and [[Jack Shepherd (actor)|Jack Shepherd]] as Ralph Palmer.''\n | LineColor=A92236\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber=89\u201390\n | Title= Conviction\n | Aux1=[[Tim Fywell]]\n | Aux2=Timothy Prager<ref name=\"9.07\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/proginfo/tv/2011/wk14/sun.shtml|title=BBC - Press Office - Network TV Programme Information BBC Week 14 Sunday 3 April 2011|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=7 August 2016}}</ref> \n | OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2011|4|3|df=y}}<br>{{Start date|2011|4|4|df=y}}\n | Aux4=7.20<br>6.73\n | ShortSummary= The investigation into the disappearance of medical student Karl Barclay is re-opened when his DNA is connected to an unidentified corpse found in a reservoir six years ago. Unable to understand why his DNA had never been entered into the database, and the even weirder fact that his body had been cremated just two weeks after it was found, Sarah discovers that Karl had been on a watchlist as a possible national threat, following the 7/7 bombings in London, and the fact that his mother reported him to the authorities following his conversion to Islam after he fell in love with a Muslim girl, Naz. Suspecting that he may have been part of a terrorist cell, Boyd discovers that his peers have taken false identities, meaning that not even Karl knew exactly who he was dealing with. Discovering that Naz was actually an informant for the secret services, on the request of fellow lover Mohammed, Boyd uncovers what really happened on the night of Karl's death. But the security services are determined to prevent Boyd from blowing the whistle, and hatch a dangerous plan to take him out. An unexpected consequence is the revelation of the true circumstances of Sarah's dismissal from Counter Terrorism.\n\n''Featuring [[Claire Benedict]] <ref name=\"tv2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/people/claire-benedict/|title=Claire Benedict - TV.com|author=TV.com|publisher=tv.com|accessdate=7 August 2016}}</ref> as Lisbetta Barclay, [[Don Warrington]] as Gideon Barclay, [[Tom Goodman-Hill]] as Tristin, [[Ashley Chin]] as Jakob Barclay, Amber Agha <ref name=\"imdb2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1457760/|title=Amber Aga - IMDb|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=7 August 2016}}</ref> as Nazeem Ahmed, [[Clive Wood]] as John Carney and Babatunde Aleshe <ref name=\"locatetv\">{{cite web|url=http://www.locatetv.com/person/babatunde-aleshe/376248|title=LocateTV.com Is Closed|publisher=locatetv.com|accessdate=7 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822075725/http://www.locatetv.com/person/babatunde-aleshe/376248|archive-date=22 August 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> as Karl Barclay.''\n | LineColor=A92236\n}}\n{{Episode list\n | EpisodeNumber=91\u201392\n | Title= Waterloo\n | Aux1=Andy Hay\n | Aux2=Ed Whitmore<ref name=\"9.09\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/proginfo/tv/2011/wk15/sun.shtml|title=BBC - Press Office - Network TV Programme Information BBC Week 15 Sunday 10 April 2011|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=7 August 2016}}</ref> \n | OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2011|4|10|df=y}}<br>{{Start date|2011|4|11|df=y}}\n | Aux4=7.03<br>7.24\n | ShortSummary= Boyd is informed by Deputy Chief Commissioner Maureen Smith that his time at the cold case unit is about to run out, and that the Met are interested in relocating him into a teaching post.

Although he had not managed to make any headway the first time round, a search of records of unidentified bodies finds a match to one of the missing boys, Pele. And further investigation leads the team directly to a torture chamber just south of the M11. However, when Eve discovers evidence that relates to another murder, Boyd finds himself entangled in a chain of events involving a prisoner being beaten to death, the killing of three police officers, the death of the sixteen boys and an Assistant Commissioner trying to protect the killer. And when he is framed for Sarah's murder, Boyd realises that time is finally running out, and that he must use his knowledge to fight for justice against a powerful adversary.\n\n''Featuring [[George Rainsford (actor)|George Rainsford]] as Luke Boyd (in flashback sequences taken from Series 7 footage), [[Elizabeth Rider]] as Deputy Chief Commissioner Maureen Smith, [[Paul McGann]] as Assistant Chief Commissioner Anthony Nicholson, [[David Bradley (English actor)|David Bradley]] as George Barlow  and [[Louis Mahoney]] as Reverend Dennis Grant.''\n | LineColor=A92236\n}}\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Waking the Dead episodes}}\n[[Category:BBC-related lists]]\n[[Category:Lists of British crime drama television series episodes]]\n[[Category:Lists of British mystery television series episodes]]\n[[Category:Waking the Dead (TV series)| Episodes]]\n", "name_user": "Eagleash", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSeries 8 (2009):Sp.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Waking_the_Dead_episodes"}

It was started in June 2003\u2014in a building that has been operating as a restaurant since the 1930s.  It is a member of the [[Downtown Dining Alliance]] and the [[U.S. Federation of Worker Cooperatives]].  It is known for its quirky, eclectic, down-home atmosphere, with boxes of old [[Trivial Pursuit]] cards on the tables.<ref name=\"Manners\">\"A Little App Happy\" by Doug Manners, Daily News-Record; September 20, 2011.</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe Little Grill has been a restaurant in Harrisonburg, Virginia since the 1930s; before that it was a bathhouse for a nearby swimming pool. In the early 1980s, Christopher Boyer, working for then owner and \"master chef\" Maria Prytula\u2014a Ukrainian-born artist and poet (d. 2012)<ref name=Obituary>{{cite news|title=Obituaries: Maria O. Prytula|url=http://www.dnronline.com/obituaries|newspaper=Daily-News Record|date=October 23, 2012}}</ref>\u2014started renting the place out on weekend nights to present rock shows and theater.  The restaurant's \"hippified\" atmosphere began during this period. Chris bought the restaurant in 1985 with blues musician and Little Grill cook, Bob Driver\u2014at which point the [[diner]] became a full-service restaurant serving three meals a day, with live entertainment on the weekends. John Eckman bought out Boyer's share of the business in 1986, and he and Driver sold the restaurant to Tom Kildea in 1990.  Kildea sold the restaurant to his former employee Ron Copeland in 1992.<ref name=\"About\">[http://littlegrillcollective.com/about-us/history History] Little Grill Collective webpage.</ref>\n\nCopeland introduced menu changes aimed at appealing to healthy-minded diners and [[vegetarian]]s. He also removed from sale all products produced by [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] such as [[Coca-Cola]], [[Anheuser-Busch]], [[Miller beer|Miller]], [[Coors Brewing Company|Coors]], and [[Folgers Coffee|Folgers]] from the restaurant.\n[[Image:Michael Good serving.JPG|thumb|left|Michael Good serves salad at the Free Food For All Soup Kitchen May 23, 2008]]\n\n===Free Food For All Soup Kitchen===\nCopeland's initial contribution was a Free Food For All Soup Kitchen, which served hot, homemade noon meals at the diner without charge to \"anyone in the world\" every Monday from October 1992 on.  This soup kitchen led to the long-term creation of Our Community Place<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ourcommunityplace.org/|title=Our Community Place &#124; Promoting personal growth and community well-being.|accessdate=July 18, 2019}}</ref> which now exists in a former [[Salvation Army]] building across the street.\n\n===Worker-owned cooperative===\nWhen Copeland decided to sell the Grill, after feeling a [[religious calling]] to Christian [[seminary]], individual employees he approached were not interested in buying.  He considered some sort of group ownership, and began researching models found in [[The Cheeseboard Collective]] in [[Berkeley, California]] and the [[Mondragon Corporation|Mondragon cooperatives]] in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque region]] of [[Spain]]; key features of a collective being a vote for each owner, and share of profits apportioned according to labor input (not capital).  In 2002, regular meetings began with Grill workers with an aim toward forming a [[Worker Cooperative|worker-owned corporation]]\u2014which would ultimately be called The Little Grill Cooperative. In June 2003, this new collective purchased the restaurant from Copeland, using what they called \"community financing\" to procure the down payment. Since then the collective aimed to work for localizing the food and creating what they regards as \"a healthy work environment for a fulfilling job experience\".<ref name=\"About\"/>\n[[Image:Little Grill Collective Main Street Harrisonburg VA May 2008.jpg|thumb|View looking northward from across N.

Each new worker-owner at Little Grill buys into the business to solidify ownership. Profits are distributed to the members \"on the basis of patronage (buying at, working at or selling through the business).\" Business control is exercised by membership on a one-member/one-vote basis.<ref>[http://littlegrillcollective.com/about-us/worker-owned-collectives Worker-owned Collectives] Little Grill Collective webpage.</ref>\n\nThe ratio of worker-owners to employees fluctuates regularly, generally being about half owners, half employees. Employees have the opportunity to become owners after working a minimum of 6 months. Coordinators are designated for many operational aspects of the restaurant such as: \"arts and entertainment (music and art shows), back of house (kitchen systems and food ordering), financial (bills, payroll and taxes), front of house (training, dining room), human resources (schedule and hiring), human relations (evaluations, mediations), maintenance (building repairs, inspections), public relations (advertising), and retail foods (catering).\" Coordinators have autonomy to make certain decisions and spend money without consulting with the group.

Touring acts working their way down [[Interstate 81]], perhaps from larger music markets up north such as Philadelphia or New York, to southern regions often stop in to perform. Local and regional acts which have appeared there include:  [[The Hackensaw Boys]], [[The Steel Wheels]], and Joe Overton and the Clear Blue Sky.  Many employees (and shared owners) of the Little Grill have been musicians, often appearing there themselves.  Owner Chris Howdyshell, who emcees the weekly open mic and puts on special shows, has formed Red River Rollercoaster and The Dish Dogs\u2014often performing on the Little Grill stage.  He draws personnel from the Grill, such as Ashley Hunter and Joshua Vana.  Past musicians who have worked there include Robert St. Ours (founder of [[The Hackensaw Boys]]), his brother Phillip St. Ours (founder of Pantherburn), Billy Brett and Terry Turtle (founders of Buck Gooter), Lara Mack and Kyle Oehmke (both members of The Dish Dogs).

It was started in June 2003\u2014in a building that has been operating as a restaurant since the 1930s.  It is a member of the [[Downtown Dining Alliance]] and the [[U.S. Federation of Worker Cooperatives]].  It is known for its quirky, eclectic, down-home atmosphere, with boxes of old [[Trivial Pursuit]] cards on the tables.<ref name=\"Manners\">\"A Little App Happy\" by Doug Manners, Daily News-Record; September 20, 2011.</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe Little Grill has been a restaurant in Harrisonburg, Virginia since the 1930s; before that it was a bathhouse for a nearby swimming pool. In the early 1980s, Christopher Boyer, working for then owner and \"master chef\" Maria Prytula\u2014a Ukrainian-born artist and poet (d. 2012)<ref name=Obituary>{{cite news|title=Obituaries: Maria O. Prytula|url=http://www.dnronline.com/obituaries|newspaper=Daily-News Record|date=October 23, 2012}}</ref>\u2014started renting the place out on weekend nights to present rock shows and theater.  The restaurant's \"hippified\" atmosphere began during this period. Chris bought the restaurant in 1985 with blues musician and Little Grill cook, Bob Driver\u2014at which point the [[diner]] became a full-service restaurant serving three meals a day, with live entertainment on the weekends. John Eckman bought out Boyer's share of the business in 1986, and he and Driver sold the restaurant to Tom Kildea in 1990.  Kildea sold the restaurant to his former employee Ron Copeland in 1992.<ref name=\"About\">[http://littlegrillcollective.com/about-us/history History] Little Grill Collective webpage.</ref>\n\nCopeland introduced menu changes aimed at appealing to healthy-minded diners and [[vegetarian]]s. He also removed from sale all products produced by [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] such as [[Coca-Cola]], [[Anheuser-Busch]], [[Miller beer|Miller]], [[Coors Brewing Company|Coors]], and [[Folgers Coffee|Folgers]] from the restaurant.\n[[Image:Michael Good serving.JPG|thumb|left|Michael Good serves salad at the Free Food For All Soup Kitchen May 23, 2008]]\n\n===Free Food For All Soup Kitchen===\nCopeland's initial contribution was a Free Food For All Soup Kitchen, which served hot, homemade noon meals at the diner without charge to \"anyone in the world\" every Monday from October 1992 on.  This soup kitchen led to the long-term creation of Our Community Place<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ourcommunityplace.org/|title=Our Community Place &#124; Promoting personal growth and community well-being.|accessdate=July 18, 2019}}</ref> which now exists in a former [[Salvation Army]] building across the street.\n\n===Worker-owned cooperative===\nWhen Copeland decided to sell the Grill, after feeling a [[religious calling]] to Christian [[seminary]], individual employees he approached were not interested in buying.  He considered some sort of group ownership, and began researching models found in [[The Cheeseboard Collective]] in [[Berkeley, California]] and the [[Mondragon Corporation|Mondragon cooperatives]] in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque region]] of [[Spain]]; key features of a collective being a vote for each owner, and share of profits apportioned according to labor input (not capital).  In 2002, regular meetings began with Grill workers with an aim toward forming a [[Worker Cooperative|worker-owned corporation]]\u2014which would ultimately be called The Little Grill Cooperative. In June 2003, this new collective purchased the restaurant from Copeland, using what they called \"community financing\" to procure the down payment. Since then the collective aimed to work for localizing the food and creating what they regards as \"a healthy work environment for a fulfilling job experience\".<ref name=\"About\"/>\n[[Image:Little Grill Collective Main Street Harrisonburg VA May 2008.jpg|thumb|View looking northward from across N.

Employees have the opportunity to become owners after working a minimum of 6 months.

Local and regional acts which have appeared there include:  [[The Hackensaw Boys]], [[The Steel Wheels]], and Joe Overton and the Clear Blue Sky.  Many employees (and shared owners) of the Little Grill have been musicians, often appearing there themselves.  Owner Chris Howdyshell, who emcees the weekly open mic and puts on special shows, has formed Red River Rollercoaster and The Dish Dogs\u2014often performing on the Little Grill stage.

This reunion was the first time that many of the original members of Route 11 Boys had performed together, and marked a return to Old Crow for Fuqua, a return to Harrisonburg for Secor, and a collective return to where it all began for all of them.\n\nHaving recently lost one of its original founders, the group had been going through a difficult time and was in need of a renewal. As Secor recounts:\n\n{{quote|After Willie (Watson) departed things were just kind of haywire for a while. Critter and I got to talking about wanting to play some [[Conjunto]] down in [[San Antonio]], or maybe go back up to [[Maine]] like we'd done in the Route 11 Boys. Both of things as a way of getting back to the reason we set out making music in the first place. What we decided on was heading back up the valley and playing at the Little Grill where we'd literally first got started. Being back home again was full of pure goodness and renewal, just to sing with an old pal in an old haunt. For some folks it was like we'd never left Rockingham County. As we pulled outta town, we picked up a hitchiker (sic), a kid we knew from high school, and dropped him off at his Mom's house in [[Weyers Cave, Virginia|Weyer's Cave]] (sic) just like time hadn't flinched.<ref name=Mateer>{{cite news|last=Mateer|first=Chris|title=Interview: Ketch, Critter, & Morgan of Old Crow Medicine Show Discuss \"Carry Me Back\"|url=http://www.nodepression.com/profiles/blogs/interview-ketch-critter-morgan-of-old-crow-medicine-show-discuss|accessdate=26 October 2013|newspaper=No Depression|date=16 July 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131026154326/http://www.nodepression.com/profiles/blogs/interview-ketch-critter-morgan-of-old-crow-medicine-show-discuss|archivedate=26 October 2013}}</ref>}}\n\nFuqua concurs that the \"whole 'Ketch and Critter' tour\" that year \"was pretty special\":\n\n{{quote|It is hard to describe all the emotions that I felt as Ketch and I rolled off the [[Cumberland Plateau|Cumberland plateau]] (sic) and into the [[Great Smoky Mountains|Smokies]], then up to our old home place in the snowy Shenandoah Valley.

We have always remained the best of friends, but at the core of our friendship, among many other things, is this passion for music, an old, [[bardic]] spirit that needed to be rekindled.<ref name=Mateer />}}\n\nExtra special was the visit to the Grill for Fuqua:\n\n{{quote|The highlight of the trip for me was playing at the Little Grill . .
