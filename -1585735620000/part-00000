(Dutch TV series)|''Wie is de Mol?'']] (\"Who is the Mole?\") aired in the winter of 2005. After the series took a year off the air, [[Angela Groothuizen]] returned to host her final season. The season took place in Australia, returning to the first country the series visited, and the island of Bali in Indonesia. The season premiered on January 14, 2005. The Reunion aired on March 18, 2005 where [[Marc-Marie Huijbregts]] was declared the winner of the season, earning a grand total of \u20ac23,000.-. Huijbregts, alongside his runner-up {{ill|Lottie Hellingman|nl}}, had successfully unmasked [[Yvon Jaspers]] as the Mole of 2005.\n\n==Format==\nFollowed the same format as its [[De Mol (TV series)|Belgian predecessor]], this was the first season which had ten Dutch celebrities travel to [[Australia]] and [[Bali|Bali, Indonesia]] to complete Assignments to earn money for the group pot. However, one of the ten is the titular Mole (de Mol), the one designated to sabotage the assignments and cause the group to earn the least amount of money for the winner's pot as possible. Every few days, players would take a 20-question [[multiple choice]] test about the identity of the Mole. Once the test is complete, the candidates await their results in an Execution ceremony. The candidate with the worst score is executed from the game, while in the event of the tie the candidate who completed their test the slowest is executed. The season plays out until there are three remaining candidates, where they must complete a final test (consisting of 40 questions). The candidate with the highest score, or had completed their test the fastest in a tie, is declared the winner and receives the group's pot.<ref>{{cite web |title=Info - Wie is de Mol? |url=https://wieisdemol.avrotros.nl/info/ |website=Wie is de Mol |publisher=AVROTROS |accessdate=1 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nTwo twists were implemented throughout the season, where at every Execution Ceremony, Angela would reveal the percent of questions that candidates got correct about the Mole.

(Dutch TV series)|''Wie is de Mol?'']] (\"Who is the Mole?\") aired in the winter of 2005. After the series took a year off the air, [[Angela Groothuizen]] returned to host her final season. The season took place in Australia, returning to the first country the series visited, and the island of Bali in Indonesia. The season premiered on January 14, 2005. The Reunion aired on March 18, 2005 where [[Marc-Marie Huijbregts]] was declared the winner of the season, earning a grand total of \u20ac23,000.-. Huijbregts, alongside his runner-up {{ill|Lottie Hellingman|nl}}, had successfully unmasked [[Yvon Jaspers]] as the Mole of 2005.\n\n==Format==\nFollowed the same format as its [[De Mol (TV series)|Belgian predecessor]], this was the first season which had ten Dutch celebrities travel to [[Australia]] and [[Bali|Bali, Indonesia]] to complete Assignments to earn money for the group pot. However, one of the ten is the titular Mole (de Mol), the one designated to sabotage the assignments and cause the group to earn the least amount of money for the winner's pot as possible. Every few days, players would take a 20-question [[multiple choice]] test about the identity of the Mole. Once the test is complete, the candidates await their results in an Execution ceremony. The candidate with the worst score is executed from the game, while in the event of the tie the candidate who completed their test the slowest is executed. The season plays out until there are three remaining candidates, where they must complete a final test (consisting of 40 questions). The candidate with the highest score, or had completed their test the fastest in a tie, is declared the winner and receives the group's pot.<ref>{{cite web |title=Info - Wie is de Mol? |url=https://wieisdemol.avrotros.nl/info/ |website=Wie is de Mol |publisher=AVROTROS |accessdate=1 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nTwo twists were implemented throughout the season, where at every Execution Ceremony, Angela would reveal the percent of questions that candidates got correct about the Mole. After from the second test onwards, if the candidates had a smaller percentage of correct answers than the previous test, two candidates would be executed from the game instead of one. The Double Execution would only happen once throughout the season, if the candidates had failed to keep their percent up.\n\nSecondly, Candidates were approached over the phone via a messager from the Mole throughout the season. At every opportunity, if the Candidates accepted the Mole's offer to sabotage assignments, they would automatically earn 5 correct answers on their next test, regardless of how they performed in the tests.\n\n==Candidates==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\n!Name\n!Day Exited\n!Result\n|-\n|[[Yvon Jaspers]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 16\n|style=background:lightgray;|'''The Mole'''\n|-\n|{{nowrap|[[Marc-Marie Huijbregts]]}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 16\n|'''Winner'''\n|-\n|{{ill|Lottie Hellingman|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 16\n|Runner-Up\n|-\n|{{ill|Isabelle Brinkman|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 15\n|3rd place\n|-\n|{{ill|Sander de Heer|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 12\n|4th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Gijs Staverman|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 10\n|rowspan=2|5th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Jim de Groot|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 10\n|-\n|[[Victoria Koblenko]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 8\n|7th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Yvonne van den Hurk|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 6\n|8th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Roeland Fernhout|fr}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 5\n|Withdrew\n|}\n\n==Candidates Progress==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"2\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:96%\"\n!

He is known for his ability to adapt to a variety of genres, and both his [[ambidextrous]] and his [[open-handed drumming]] styles. He plays the drums and sings backing vocals in the band. Beauford was ranked number 10 by a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine reader's poll in 2010 for greatest drummers of all-time.<ref name=\"RS greatest drummers poll\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/blogs/staff-blog/readers-rock-list-best-drummers-20100208 |title=Readers' Rock List: Best Drummers |date=February 8, 2010 |publisher=Rolling Stone magazine |accessdate=April 25, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110413094911/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/blogs/staff-blog/readers-rock-list-best-drummers-20100208 |archivedate=April 13, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n== Background ==\nBeauford was first exposed to the drums at age three. At the time, his father had bought tickets to a [[Buddy Rich]] concert and could not find someone to watch his son, so he took young Beauford along to the show. Beauford was mesmerized by Buddy Rich on stage.  After that show, Beauford's father bought his son a tin drum set with paper heads, since Beauford showed so much interest in learning the instrument. Beauford began performing professionally when he was nine.<ref name=\"official website1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.davematthewsband.com/#/band|title=Carter Beauford|year=2009|publisher=Official DMB website|accessdate=2009-07-11}}</ref>\n\nBeauford explains his unusual playing style in his instructional video \"Under The Table & Drumming\", attributing his use of left-hand-lead on a right-handed kit to playing his own kit in front of a mirror as a child in an attempt to emulate his favorite drummers, like [[Buddy Rich]]. He unknowingly set up his drums in reverse of whichever performer and set that he had in mind, in an attempt to make the mirrored image of himself match that of the audience's perspective, as he had seen it on stage and TV. This helped him to become completely [[ambidextrous]] at a very early age, albeit by accident.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\n=== Secrets, Dave Matthews Band ===\n[[File:TATM DMB 1998 - picture 2.jpg|thumb|Members from [[Toots and the Maytals|Toots & the Maytals]] and [[Dave Matthews Band]] when performing together in 1998. [[Paul Douglas (musician)|Paul Douglas]] (left), Carter Beauford (back), [[LeRoi Moore]] (front), [[Toots Hibbert]] (right).]]\nEventually, he joined Secrets, a [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]-based [[jazz fusion]] band. Other members included childhood friend and next-door neighbor saxophonist [[LeRoi Moore]], trumpeter [[John D'earth]], vocalist Dawn Thompson, bassist Keith Horne, keyboardist [[Butch Taylor]], keyboardist Dane Bryant, saxophonist Eddie Williams and [[Virtuoso|virtuoso guitarist]] [[Tim Reynolds]].  Secrets performed throughout Virginia, at places such as The Jewish Mother in Virginia Beach, and at Miller's, the bar in Charlottesville where [[Dave Matthews]] worked as a [[bartender]]. Beauford also played [[jazz]] in Blue Indigo with LeRoi Moore, [[Sal Soghoian]], and George Melvin. Blue Indigo performed regularly at Tokyo Rose and Miller's, and was featured at the [[Celebration of the Arts Festival|Delaware Water Gap Jazz Festival]]. Eventually, Matthews approached both Beauford and Moore regarding some music he had written that he wished to record. Beauford agreed to perform on a demo, which is how he became involved with the group that was to become the Dave Matthews Band.\n\n== Collaboration ==\nBeauford has also worked with other artists on [[Jam session|jam]] projects, including [[Vertical Horizon]], [[Carlos Santana]], [[Rashawn Ross]], [[John Popper]] (of [[Blues Traveler]]), [[Tim Reynolds]], [[B\u00e9la Fleck]] and [[Victor Wooten]]; both alone and within [[B\u00e9la Fleck and the Flecktones]].<ref name=\"Allmusic1\">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=carter-beauford-p147832/credits|pure_url=yes}}|title=Carter Beauford|last=Griffith|first=J.T.|year=2010|work=All Music review|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=October 14, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Equipment==\n[[File:Carter Beauford.jpg|thumb|180px|Beauford behind his drum kit with the Dave Matthews Band]]\nBeauford uses a [[Yamaha Drums]] Recording Custom drum kit, a [[Ludwig-Musser|Ludwig]] Alex Van Halen Signature Rosewood snare drum, 6.5x14\" with a die-cast hoop on the batter side and a triple flanged hoop snare side, [[Zildjian]] cymbals, [[Remo]] drumheads, Vic Firth sticks and mallets, [[Yamaha]] and [[Drum Workshop]] hardware including a [[Yamaha]] Hex-Rack since the 2008 Summer Tour and various [[Latin Percussion]] [[Cowbell (instrument)|cowbell]]s, [[Woodblock (instrument)|woodblocks]] and other assorted percussion equipment.  He also uses [[FootJoy]] golf gloves rather than traditional drum gloves.

He is known for his ability to adapt to a variety of genres, and both his [[ambidextrous]] and his [[open-handed drumming]] styles. He plays the drums and sings backing vocals in the band. Beauford was ranked number 10 by a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine reader's poll in 2010 for greatest drummers of all-time.<ref name=\"RS greatest drummers poll\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/blogs/staff-blog/readers-rock-list-best-drummers-20100208 |title=Readers' Rock List: Best Drummers |date=February 8, 2010 |publisher=Rolling Stone magazine |accessdate=April 25, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110413094911/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/blogs/staff-blog/readers-rock-list-best-drummers-20100208 |archivedate=April 13, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n== Background ==\nBeauford was first exposed to the drums at age three. At the time, his father had bought tickets to a [[Buddy Rich]] concert and could not find someone to watch his son, so he took young Beauford along to the show. Beauford was mesmerized by Buddy Rich on stage.  After that show, Beauford's father bought his son a tin drum set with paper heads, since Beauford showed so much interest in learning the instrument. Beauford began performing professionally when he was nine.<ref name=\"official website1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.davematthewsband.com/#/band|title=Carter Beauford|year=2009|publisher=Official DMB website|accessdate=2009-07-11}}</ref>\n\nBeauford explains his unusual playing style in his instructional video \"Under The Table & Drumming\", attributing his use of left-hand-lead on a right-handed kit to playing his own kit in front of a mirror as a child in an attempt to emulate his favorite drummers, like [[Buddy Rich]]. He unknowingly set up his drums in reverse of whichever performer and set that he had in mind, in an attempt to make the mirrored image of himself match that of the audience's perspective, as he had seen it on stage and TV. This helped him to become completely [[ambidextrous]] at a very early age, albeit by accident.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\n=== Secrets, Dave Matthews Band ===\n[[File:TATM DMB 1998 - picture 2.jpg|thumb|Members from [[Toots and the Maytals|Toots & the Maytals]] and [[Dave Matthews Band]] when performing together in 1998. [[Paul Douglas (musician)|Paul Douglas]] (left), Carter Beauford (back), [[LeRoi Moore]] (front), [[Toots Hibbert]] (right).]]\nEventually, he joined Secrets, a [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]-based [[jazz fusion]] band. Other members included childhood friend and next-door neighbor saxophonist [[LeRoi Moore]], trumpeter [[John D'earth]], vocalist Dawn Thompson, bassist Keith Horne, keyboardist [[Butch Taylor]], keyboardist Dane Bryant, saxophonist Eddie Williams and [[Virtuoso|virtuoso guitarist]] [[Tim Reynolds]].  Secrets performed throughout Virginia, at places such as The Jewish Mother in Virginia Beach, and at Miller's, the bar in Charlottesville where [[Dave Matthews]] worked as a [[bartender]]. Beauford also played [[jazz]] in Blue Indigo with LeRoi Moore, [[Sal Soghoian]], and George Melvin. Blue Indigo performed regularly at Tokyo Rose and Miller's, and was featured at the [[Celebration of the Arts Festival|Delaware Water Gap Jazz Festival]]. Eventually, Matthews approached both Beauford and Moore regarding some music he had written that he wished to record. Beauford agreed to perform on a demo, which is how he became involved with the group that was to become the Dave Matthews Band.\n\n== Collaboration ==\nBeauford has also worked with other artists on [[Jam session|jam]] projects, including [[Vertical Horizon]], [[Carlos Santana]], [[Rashawn Ross]], [[John Popper]] (of [[Blues Traveler]]), [[Tim Reynolds]], [[B\u00e9la Fleck]] and [[Victor Wooten]]; both alone and within [[B\u00e9la Fleck and the Flecktones]].<ref name=\"Allmusic1\">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=carter-beauford-p147832/credits|pure_url=yes}}|title=Carter Beauford|last=Griffith|first=J.T.|year=2010|work=All Music review|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=October 14, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Equipment==\n[[File:Carter Beauford.jpg|thumb|180px|Beauford behind his drum kit with the Dave Matthews Band]]\nBeauford uses a [[Yamaha Drums]] Recording Custom drum kit, a [[Ludwig-Musser|Ludwig]] Alex Van Halen Signature Rosewood snare drum, 6.5x14\" with a die-cast hoop on the batter side and a triple flanged hoop snare side, [[Zildjian]] cymbals, [[Remo]] drumheads, Vic Firth sticks and mallets, [[Yamaha]] and [[Drum Workshop]] hardware including a [[Yamaha]] Hex-Rack since the 2008 Summer Tour and various [[Latin Percussion]] [[Cowbell (instrument)|cowbell]]s, [[Woodblock (instrument)|woodblocks]] and other assorted percussion equipment.
