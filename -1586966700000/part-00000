He has held concerts in Japan's largest stadiums, including [[Nippon Budokan]], [[Yokohama Arena]], [[Yokohama Stadium]], [[Zozo Marine Stadium|Chiba Marine Stadium]], [[MetLife Dome|Seibu Dome]], [[NHK Hall]], and [[Osaka-j\u014d Hall|Osaka Castle Hall]].\n\nOe has also written and produced music for many artists, including [[Seiko Matsuda]], [[Misato Watanabe]], [[Hiromi Go]], [[Hikaru Genji (band)|Hikaru Genji]] and [[Sayuri Ishikawa]].\n\nHe has composed music for the soundtrack of the film ''[[Doraemon: Nobita's Great Adventure in the South Seas]]'', as well as \"Believe\" which was featured in [[Sanrio Puroland]].\n\n== Early life ==\nSenri Oe was born on September 6, 1960, in Fujiidera city [[Osaka]], [[Japan]]. Oe began playing piano at the age of three, and was classically trained by his junior high school teacher Yumi Nara, who would go on to become an acclaimed opera singer. After each of their lessons, Nara would encourage Oe to improvise, and eventually Oe began to compose.\n\nUpon being introduced to music by The Carpenters, Captain & Tenille and Gilbert O'Sullivan, Oe decided to become a singer-songwriter. Soon after, Oe's music repertoire expanded to include jazz musicians such as Chris Conor, Bill Evans, Thelonius Monk, Antonio Carlos Jobim, Winton Kelly, Miles Davis and Charlie Parker.\n\nIn 1975, Oe participated in the final [[Yamaha Popular Song Contest]] POPCON (akin to American Idol).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chicagomusicguide.com/featured-artist-senri-oe/|title=FEATURED ARTIST - Senri Oe|date=2018-06-24|website=Chicago Music Guide|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref>\n\nIn 1980, Oe entered [[Kwansei Gakuin University]] and majored in economics while simultaneously beginning to pursue a professional music career. He formed his first bands during his time at university, was scouted by [[Sony Music Entertainment Japan|Sony Music]] and signed to [[Epic Records Japan|Epic Sony]] Japan in 1981.\n\n== Music career ==\n\n=== 1983-1984: Early pop career and debut album ===\nOn February 27, 1983, Oe performed on [[Sapporo Television Broadcasting|STV Radio]]'s Sunday Jumbo Special in Sapporo, Hokkaido, granting him his initial exposure as a professional musician. Within this segment, Oe began a ten-minute performance in which he improvised a song on live radio.\n\nOe soon released his first single \"Wallabee Shoes  (\u30ef\u30e9\u30d3\u30fc\u306c\u304e\u3059\u3066\u3066),\" followed by his debut album, WAKUWAKU. Quickly garnering popularity, \"Wallabee Shoes\" charted at No. 10 in Sapporo radio.\n\nOe appeared on [[All Night Fuji]] (Akin to Saturday Night Live in Japan) on Channel 8 alongside [[Epic Records Japan|Epic Sony]] label-mates [[Wham!|Wham]] from Britain.\n\n=== 1985-2007: Greater pop music career success ===\nDirectly after graduating from [[Kwansei Gakuin University]], Oe rose to fame in November 1984 with the success of his sixth single, \"10 People, 10 Colors (\u5341\u4eba\u5341\u8272).\" His third album, Miseinen (\u672a\u6210\u5e74) Juvenile charted at No. 5 on [[Oricon]] (Japanese equivalent to the Billboard weekly chart).\n\nWith his now growing popularity across Japan, Oe toured performing in Japan's largest venues and stadiums, including [[Nippon Budokan]] (with [[seating capacity]] of 14,471, akin to Madison Square Garden) to promote his fifth album, AVEC Tour Final, in 1987.\n\nOe's seventh album 1234 was awarded Album of the Year in the third [[Japan Gold Disc Award|Gold Disc Awards]] (Japan's equivalent of the Grammy Awards) in the Pop Male Solo Artist Category.\n\nContinuing to tour large venues throughout Japan, Oe released the album, ''Sloppy Joe'', on March 25, 1989, which charted at No. 2 on the [[Oricon]] (Japan's equivalent of Billboard weekly chart).\n\nMeanwhile, Oe appeared as an actor on television for the first time, in the dramatic show entitled Kimi Ga Uso Wo Tuita.\n\nOe's ninth album, APOLLO, was the first of his albums to be recorded in New York City. The album was released to critical acclaim, charting at No.1 in the [[Oricon]] weekly chart on September, 21st 1990. Following APOLLO's success, Oe again toured in stadiums ([[Yokohama Stadium]], [[MetLife Dome|Seibu Dome]], [[Zozo Marine Stadium|Chiba Marine Stadium]], [[Yokohama Arena]], [[Osaka-j\u014d Hall|Osaka Castle Hall]]).\n\nOe's single \"Never See You Again (\u683c\u597d\u60aa\u3044\u3075\u3089\u308c\u304b\u305f) Kakko Warui Furare Kata\" was released in September 1990 and was his highest-charting single to date, charting at No.2 in the Oricon weekly chart.\n\nWhile continuing to record and perform, in 2000 Oe established his own record label, Station Kids Records, an imprint of Sony Music Entertainment Japan.\n\nOe also began to branch out to musical composition beyond pop music. Among these projects, he scored the soundtrack for the film Noto No Hanayome,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1217486/|title=Senri Oe|website=IMDb|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> [[Sanrio Puroland]] Park's Musical titled Believe, music for the performances of illusionist [[Princess Tenko]] Play, for Destiny. Also, notably, Oe scored music for the Japanese animated film ''[[Doraemon: Nobita's Great Adventure in the South Seas]]'', as well as \"Kono Hoshino Dokokade\" by Yasuda Sisters.\n\n=== 2008-2012: Career shift to jazz ===\nOn December 22, 2007, Oe announced that he would study jazz music in [[School of Jazz (The New School)|The New School for Jazz]] and moved to Manhattan on January 10, 2008, with his then puppy, a [[dachshund]] named Peace.\n\nSince Oe was fifteen years old, he was intent on learning jazz music theory at school. Due to his pop singer-songwriter career unexpectedly taking off, he chose to pause his jazz aspirations later in life.\n\n=== 2012-Present: Beginning of jazz pianist career ===\nAfter graduating from The New School for Jazz, Oe launched his jazz record label in 2012. It was called \"Peace Never Die\" Records, abbreviated to PND Records. His dog, Peace, also appeared in PND's logo. Peace has received a certificate which allows her to officially qualify as an emotional support dog for Oe.\n\nOe's jazz debut album was ''Boys Mature Slow''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jazzmusicarchives.com/video/senri-oe/5600|title=SENRI OE Boys mature slow /Senri Oe (video)|website=JazzMusicArchives.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref>\n\nFollowing conversations with former Tokyo Jazz Festival producer, Atsuko Yashima, Oe concluded that his second album's style could expand to include for a jazz 'big band' ensemble.\n\nOe composed eleven pieces for his next album, ''Spooky Hotel'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kennedy-center.org/artist/B214393|title=Senri Oe|website=www.kennedy-center.org|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> which was released in 2013.\n\nFollowing ''Spooky Hotel'', Oe's big band performed in the Tokyo Jazz Festival at Tokyo Forum A Hall.\n\nOe  worked towards composing for a drum-less trio was entitled Collective Scribble;<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bluenote.co.jp/jp/reports/2015/05/05/senri-oe-ny-trio-collective-scribble-tour-2015.html|title=Senri Oe Trio Bluenote collective Scribble|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Oe remarked that here, saxophone and piano combined with upright bass, \"like a drawing scribble.\"\n\nAt the same time, Oe was creating his fourth jazz vocal album, ''Answer July'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jazzspeaks.org/senri-oe-record-release-answer-july/|title=Senri Oe Record Release: Answer July|website=Jazz Speaks|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://musicalmemoirs.wordpress.com/2016/07/15/new-cd-releases-reflect-sounds-of-summer-and-celebrate-men-of-jazz/|title=NEW CD RELEASES REFLECT SOUNDS OF SUMMER and CELEBRATE MEN OF JAZZ|date=2016-07-15|website=Musicalmemoirs's Blog|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> with [[Sheila Jordan]], [[Jon Hendricks]], [[Theo Bleckmann]] and [https://laurenkinhan.com/about/ Lauren Kinhan].\n\n''Answer July'' was a Grammy-nominated consideration album in the Best Jazz Album in 2017.\n\nIn addition, Oe challenged himself to adopt the concept of combining pop with jazz in his fifth studio jazz album ''Boys & Girls'',<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.axs.com/interview-j-pop-star-turned-jazz-man-senri-oe-talks-solo-piano-for-det-132772|title=Interview: J-Pop star-turned-jazz man Senri Oe talks solo piano for Detroit Jazz Fest|work=AXS|access-date=2019-10-31|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/music/2018/04/11/detroit-jazz-festival-chick-corea-bassist-esparanza-spaulding-drummer-terri-lyne-carrington/33738717/|title=2018 Detroit Jazz Fest lineup boasts diversity|website=Detroit News|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.khon2.com/living-808/japanese-superstar-senri-oe-plays-the-blue-note/|title=Japanese Superstar Senri Oe plays the Blue Note|date=2019-05-21|website=KHON2|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fox2detroit.com/mornings/jazz-pianist-senri-oe-performs|title=Jazz pianist Senri Oe performs|date=2018-09-03|website=FOX 2 Detroit|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jazziz.com/a-whole-new-world-senri-oe-gets-his-kicks-as-a-jazz-pianist/|title=A Whole New World: Senri Oe Gets His Kicks As a Jazz Pianist|last=Magazine|first=JAZZIZ|date=2018-12-15|website=JAZZIZ Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> released in 2018.

He has held concerts in Japan's largest stadiums, including [[Nippon Budokan]], [[Yokohama Arena]], [[Yokohama Stadium]], [[Zozo Marine Stadium|Chiba Marine Stadium]], [[MetLife Dome|Seibu Dome]], [[NHK Hall]], and [[Osaka-j\u014d Hall|Osaka Castle Hall]].\n\nOe has also written and produced music for many artists, including [[Seiko Matsuda]], [[Misato Watanabe]], [[Hiromi Go]], [[Hikaru Genji (band)|Hikaru Genji]] and [[Sayuri Ishikawa]].\n\nHe has composed music for the soundtrack of the film ''[[Doraemon: Nobita's Great Adventure in the South Seas]]'', as well as \"Believe\" which was featured in [[Sanrio Puroland]].\n\n== Early life ==\nSenri Oe was born on September 6, 1960, in Fujiidera city [[Osaka]], [[Japan]]. Oe began playing piano at the age of three, and was classically trained by his junior high school teacher Yumi Nara, who would go on to become an acclaimed opera singer. After each of their lessons, Nara would encourage Oe to improvise, and eventually Oe began to compose.\n\nUpon being introduced to music by The Carpenters, Captain & Tenille and Gilbert O'Sullivan, Oe decided to become a singer-songwriter. Soon after, Oe's music repertoire expanded to include jazz musicians such as Chris Conor, Bill Evans, Thelonius Monk, Antonio Carlos Jobim, Winton Kelly, Miles Davis and Charlie Parker.\n\nIn 1975, Oe participated in the final [[Yamaha Popular Song Contest]] POPCON (akin to American Idol).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chicagomusicguide.com/featured-artist-senri-oe/|title=FEATURED ARTIST - Senri Oe|date=2018-06-24|website=Chicago Music Guide|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref>\n\nIn 1980, Oe entered [[Kwansei Gakuin University]] and majored in economics while simultaneously beginning to pursue a professional music career. He formed his first bands during his time at university, was scouted by [[Sony Music Entertainment Japan|Sony Music]] and signed to [[Epic Records Japan|Epic Sony]] Japan in 1981.\n\n== Music career ==\n\n=== 1983-1984: Early pop career and debut album ===\nOn February 27, 1983, Oe performed on [[Sapporo Television Broadcasting|STV Radio]]'s Sunday Jumbo Special in Sapporo, Hokkaido, granting him his initial exposure as a professional musician. Within this segment, Oe began a ten-minute performance in which he improvised a song on live radio.\n\nOe soon released his first single \"Wallabee Shoes  (\u30ef\u30e9\u30d3\u30fc\u306c\u304e\u3059\u3066\u3066),\" followed by his debut album, WAKUWAKU. Quickly garnering popularity, \"Wallabee Shoes\" charted at No. 10 in Sapporo radio.\n\nOe appeared on [[All Night Fuji]] (Akin to Saturday Night Live in Japan) on Channel 8 alongside [[Epic Records Japan|Epic Sony]] label-mates [[Wham!|Wham]] from Britain.\n\n=== 1985-2007: Greater pop music career success ===\nDirectly after graduating from [[Kwansei Gakuin University]], Oe rose to fame in November 1984 with the success of his sixth single, \"10 People, 10 Colors (\u5341\u4eba\u5341\u8272).\" His third album, Miseinen (\u672a\u6210\u5e74) Juvenile charted at No. 5 on [[Oricon]] (Japanese equivalent to the Billboard weekly chart).\n\nWith his now growing popularity across Japan, Oe toured performing in Japan's largest venues and stadiums, including [[Nippon Budokan]] (with [[seating capacity]] of 14,471, akin to Madison Square Garden) to promote his fifth album, AVEC Tour Final, in 1987.\n\nOe's seventh album 1234 was awarded Album of the Year in the third [[Japan Gold Disc Award|Gold Disc Awards]] (Japan's equivalent of the Grammy Awards) in the Pop Male Solo Artist Category.\n\nContinuing to tour large venues throughout Japan, Oe released the album, ''Sloppy Joe'', on March 25, 1989, which charted at No. 2 on the [[Oricon]] (Japan's equivalent of Billboard weekly chart).\n\nMeanwhile, Oe appeared as an actor on television for the first time, in the dramatic show entitled Kimi Ga Uso Wo Tuita.\n\nOe's ninth album, APOLLO, was the first of his albums to be recorded in New York City. The album was released to critical acclaim, charting at No.1 in the [[Oricon]] weekly chart on September, 21st 1990. Following APOLLO's success, Oe again toured in stadiums ([[Yokohama Stadium]], [[MetLife Dome|Seibu Dome]], [[Zozo Marine Stadium|Chiba Marine Stadium]], [[Yokohama Arena]], [[Osaka-j\u014d Hall|Osaka Castle Hall]]).\n\nOe's single \"Never See You Again (\u683c\u597d\u60aa\u3044\u3075\u3089\u308c\u304b\u305f) Kakko Warui Furare Kata\" was released in September 1990 and was his highest-charting single to date, charting at No.2 in the Oricon weekly chart.\n\nWhile continuing to record and perform, in 2000 Oe established his own record label, Station Kids Records, an imprint of Sony Music Entertainment Japan.\n\nOe also began to branch out to musical composition beyond pop music. Among these projects, he scored the soundtrack for the film Noto No Hanayome,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1217486/|title=Senri Oe|website=IMDb|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> [[Sanrio Puroland]] Park's Musical titled Believe, music for the performances of illusionist [[Princess Tenko]] Play, for Destiny. Also, notably, Oe scored music for the Japanese animated film ''[[Doraemon: Nobita's Great Adventure in the South Seas]]'', as well as \"Kono Hoshino Dokokade\" by Yasuda Sisters.\n\n=== 2008-2012: Career shift to jazz ===\nOn December 22, 2007, Oe announced that he would study jazz music in [[School of Jazz (The New School)|The New School for Jazz]] and moved to Manhattan on January 10, 2008, with his then puppy, a [[dachshund]] named Peace.\n\nSince Oe was fifteen years old, he was intent on learning jazz music theory at school. Due to his pop singer-songwriter career unexpectedly taking off, he chose to pause his jazz aspirations later in life.\n\n=== 2012-Present: Beginning of jazz pianist career ===\nAfter graduating from The New School for Jazz, Oe launched his jazz record label in 2012. It was called \"Peace Never Die\" Records, abbreviated to PND Records. His dog, Peace, also appeared in PND's logo. Peace has received a certificate which allows her to officially qualify as an emotional support dog for Oe.\n\nOe's jazz debut album was ''Boys Mature Slow''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jazzmusicarchives.com/video/senri-oe/5600|title=SENRI OE Boys mature slow /Senri Oe (video)|website=JazzMusicArchives.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref>\n\nFollowing conversations with former Tokyo Jazz Festival producer, Atsuko Yashima, Oe concluded that his second album's style could expand to include for a jazz 'big band' ensemble.\n\nOe composed eleven pieces for his next album, ''Spooky Hotel'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kennedy-center.org/artist/B214393|title=Senri Oe|website=www.kennedy-center.org|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> which was released in 2013.\n\nFollowing ''Spooky Hotel'', Oe's big band performed in the Tokyo Jazz Festival at Tokyo Forum A Hall.\n\nOe's progress again toward composing for a drumless trio was entitled Collective Scribble;<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bluenote.co.jp/jp/reports/2015/05/05/senri-oe-ny-trio-collective-scribble-tour-2015.html|title=Senri Oe Trio Bluenote collective Scribble|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Oe remarked that here, saxophone and piano combined with upright bass, \"like a drawing scribble.\"\n\nAt the same time, Oe was creating his fourth jazz vocal album, ''Answer July'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jazzspeaks.org/senri-oe-record-release-answer-july/|title=Senri Oe Record Release: Answer July|website=Jazz Speaks|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://musicalmemoirs.wordpress.com/2016/07/15/new-cd-releases-reflect-sounds-of-summer-and-celebrate-men-of-jazz/|title=NEW CD RELEASES REFLECT SOUNDS OF SUMMER and CELEBRATE MEN OF JAZZ|date=2016-07-15|website=Musicalmemoirs's Blog|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> with Sheila Jordan, Jon Hendricks, Theo Bleckmann and Lauren Kinham\n\n''Answer July'' was a Grammy-nominated consideration album in the Best Jazz Album in 2017.\n\nIn addition, Oe challenged himself to adopt the concept of combining pop with jazz in his fifth studio jazz album ''Boys & Girls'',<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.axs.com/interview-j-pop-star-turned-jazz-man-senri-oe-talks-solo-piano-for-det-132772|title=Interview: J-Pop star-turned-jazz man Senri Oe talks solo piano for Detroit Jazz Fest|work=AXS|access-date=2019-10-31|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/music/2018/04/11/detroit-jazz-festival-chick-corea-bassist-esparanza-spaulding-drummer-terri-lyne-carrington/33738717/|title=2018 Detroit Jazz Fest lineup boasts diversity|website=Detroit News|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.khon2.com/living-808/japanese-superstar-senri-oe-plays-the-blue-note/|title=Japanese Superstar Senri Oe plays the Blue Note|date=2019-05-21|website=KHON2|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fox2detroit.com/mornings/jazz-pianist-senri-oe-performs|title=Jazz pianist Senri Oe performs|date=2018-09-03|website=FOX 2 Detroit|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jazziz.com/a-whole-new-world-senri-oe-gets-his-kicks-as-a-jazz-pianist/|title=A Whole New World: Senri Oe Gets His Kicks As a Jazz Pianist|last=Magazine|first=JAZZIZ|date=2018-12-15|website=JAZZIZ Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> released in 2018.

It is believed that it may have originally been part of the [[Handsworth, West Midlands|Handsworth]] parish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=36165|title=West Bromwich: Churches \u2013 British History Online|website=www.british-history.ac.uk}}</ref> A [[Benedictine]] [[priory]] existed in West Bromwich from the 12th century around which the settlement of ''Broomwich Heath'' grew. In 1727, the town became a stop on the coaching road between London and [[Shrewsbury, Shropshire|Shrewsbury]] and the beginning of its growth dates from this time. The prefix 'West' serves to distinguish it from the village of [[Castle Bromwich]], around {{convert|8|mi|0}} to the east on the other side of Birmingham.\n\n===Development===\nIn the 19th century, coal deposits were discovered, ensuring that the town grew rapidly as an industrial centre, with industries such as spring, gun and nail making developing. Well before the end of the 19th century, West Bromwich had established itself as a prominent area to match older neighbouring towns including [[Dudley]] and [[Walsall]].\n\n{{Historical populations\n| source =<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/STS/WestBromwich/#Census|title=Genuki: West Bromwich, Staffordshire|first=|last=GENUKI|website=www.genuki.org.uk}}</ref>\n| 1801 | 5687\n| 1811 | 7485\n| 1821 | 9505\n| 1831 | 15377\n| 1841 | 26121\n| 1851 | 34581\n| 1861 | 41795\n| 1871 | 47918\n| 1881 | 56295\n| 1891 | 59538\n| 1901 | 65175\n| 1950 | 89000\n| 1991 | 146386\n}}\n\nIn 1888, West Bromwich became a [[county borough]], incorporating the village of [[Great Barr]]. It was expanded in 1966, acquiring most of the [[borough]] of [[Tipton]] and [[Wednesbury]] [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]] as well as a small section of [[Coseley]] urban district, before joining with the neighbouring county borough of [[County Borough of Warley|Warley]] (which contained the towns of [[Rowley Regis]], [[Oldbury, West Midlands|Oldbury]] and [[Smethwick]]) in 1974 to form the [[Metropolitan Borough of Sandwell]].\n\nCharlemont Hall, built during the 1750s, stood on the west side of the present Charlemont Crescent, in the [[Charlemont and Grove Vale]] district of the town. Charlemont Hall was described c. 1800 as \"a lofty neat-looking house of brick, faced with stone, with iron palisades etc. in front.\" An east wing was added in 1855. The last occupant was the widow of Thomas Jones, town clerk of Wednesbury 1897\u20131921. The house was demolished in 1948, and is now covered by a number of smaller detached homes. Much of the surrounding area was developed during the 1960s as the Charlemont Farm housing estate, which is a mix of private and [[Public housing in the United Kingdom|council housing]].\n\nThe population of West Bromwich suffered heavily in the [[Cholera epidemic of 1831]] which spread northwards into the town. A temporary board of health was set up and a hospital opened in the former Revivalist chapel in Spon Lane. The natural gradual slope of the land provided drainage within the soil, however, urbanisation made this increasingly difficult and drainage along the streets was described as inadequate. The [[West Bromwich Town Improvement Commissioners]] was established in 1854, and they tackled the drainage problem in the town. They appointed members to new titles and in the 1880s bought land in Friar Park for a sewerage farm.\n\nUnder the [[Reform Act 1832]], West Bromwich became part of the new southern division of [[Staffordshire]], and under the [[Reform Act 1867]] it was transferred to the parliamentary borough of Wednesbury.<ref name=\"BHO p history\">{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=36164&strquery=west+bromwich|title=West Bromwich: Parliamentary history \u2013 British History Online|website=www.british-history.ac.uk}}</ref> Under the [[Redistribution of Seats Act of 1885]], the borough of West Bromwich became a parliamentary borough returning one member. In 1885, it was held by the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] but from 1886 to 1906 it was held by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] before being held by the Liberal Party again until 1910 when the Conservative Party regained the area which they held until 1918 under the representation of [[Viscount Lewisham]].<ref name=\"BHO p history\" /> In 1918, it was won by [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] who have held it since, except for the period between 1931 and 1935 when it held by the [[National Unionist]]s.<ref name=\"BHO p history\" />\n\n[[File:West Bromwich Library.jpg|thumb|West Bromwich Library]]\n\n===20th century===\nBy the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, many of the older houses built to house workers during the [[Industrial Revolution]] were becoming unfit for human habitation{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}  Sanitation was inadequate, decay was rife, and the homes were becoming a danger to the health and safety of their inhabitants. After the end of the war, the local council started building new homes to rehouse people from the rundown town centre. However, there are still many late 19th century and early 20th century buildings around the centre of West Bromwich.\n\nThe first [[Council housing]] in West Bromwich was built in 1920 on the Tantany Estate to the north of the town centre. Within 20 years, several thousand council houses had been built by West Bromwich County Borough Council. The largest developments were mostly in the north of the town, including the Charlemont Farm Estate around Walsall Road, and the Friar Park Estate near the border with Wednesbury.<ref name=wbgt>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=36157|title=West Bromwich: The growth of the town \u2013 British History Online|website=www.british-history.ac.uk}}</ref>\n \n[[File:2015-03-07 - ThinkTank - Sasha Taylor - 03.JPG|thumb|World War II fund-raising badge, sold during \"War Weapons Week\", 15\u201322 March 1941]]\n\nThe town suffered significant damage from air raids in [[World War II]], with 58 civilian deaths, most in the raids of 19 November 1940 around Oak Road and Lombard Street to the west of the town centre. There were a few other less severe raids during the war on parts of West Bromwich including Stone Cross and Tantany, with no fatalities. This occurred on the same night as the [[Birmingham Blitz]], which resulted in thousands of casualties, as well as the less severe raids on nearby [[Dudley]] and [[Tipton]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/4005019/WEST%20BROMWICH,%20COUNTY%20BOROUGH|title=Cemetery}}</ref>\n\nThe first major postwar council housing development was the Harvills Hawthorn Estate near Hill Top, which was completed in 1948.<ref name=wbgt />\n\nMass immigration from the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] took place in West Bromwich during the 1950s and 1960s, with most of these hailing from the [[Indian subcontinent]], although a significant number of [[British African-Caribbean community|Afro-Caribbean]] immigrants also settled in West Bromwich. The majority of these immigrants settled in the older parts of the town that were mostly made up of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian period|Edwardian]] terraced houses.\n\nThe local road network was also massively improved during the 1960s and 1970s. West Bromwich is at the extreme northern end of the [[M5 motorway]], with junction 1 serving the town on the [[A41 road]]. Traffic passing through West Bromwich on the main route from [[Wolverhampton]] to [[Birmingham]] was soon diverted along the new dual carriageway, the ''Northern Loop Road'' (also known as ''The Expressway''), after its opening in 1972, with another dual carriageway being built to link The Expressway with neighbouring [[Oldbury, West Midlands|Oldbury]].\n\n[[File:The local government structure within the Black Country (Pre-1966).png|thumb|The local government structure within North Worcestershire and South Staffordshire \u2013 Prior to the ''West Midlands Order 1965'' reorganisation]]\n\nWest Bromwich County Borough was expanded in 1966 to include the bulk of [[Tipton]] and [[Wednesbury]], while a small part of the south-eastern section of the town was absorbed into the new [[Warley County Borough]] which was centered on neighbouring [[Oldbury, West Midlands|Oldbury]], [[Smethwick]] and [[Rowley Regis]]. The actual town boundaries of West Bromwich were also altered at this time, placing the Friar Park estate in Wednesbury, while the [[Hateley Heath]] area of Wednesbury was now within the borders of West Bromwich township.\n\nAs with many other parts of the [[English Midlands|Midlands]], West Bromwich was hit badly by the [[recession]]s of the mid-1970s and early 1980s, resulting in mass unemployment across the town, exceeding 20% in some districts.\n\nQueen's Square shopping centre opened in the town centre in 1971, providing shoppers with a 60-unit indoor shopping centre and an 850-space [[multi-storey car park]]. It cost \u00a33million to build.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queenssquaresc.co.uk/showPage.aspx?fldPageID=18|title=Queen's Square Shopping Centre<!-- Bot generated title -->|publisher=}}</ref> The smaller King's Square shopping centre also opened in the town in 1971.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.completelyretail.co.uk/scheme/Kings-Square-Sandwell-Centre-West-Bromwich/index.html|title=Kings Square Sandwell Centre, West Bromwich \u2013 Completely Retail|first=Completely|last=Group|website=www.completelyretail.co.uk}}</ref> On 8 December 2011, 40 years after the opening of Queen's Square, Sandwell Council announced that Queen's Square would be refurbished at a cost of \u00a35million. By this stage, the centre was falling into disrepair and only 33 of the 61 available units were occupied. Once again, West Bromwich had been hit hard by another [[Late 2000s recession|recession]], with local unemployment running high again, as well as a high vacancy rate for commercial and industrial units.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/news/2011/12/08/5m-revamp-for-west-bromwich-shopping-centre/|title=\u00a35m revamp for West Bromwich shopping centre|website=www.expressandstar.com}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bromford Lane, West Bromwich - geograph.org.uk - 107925.jpg|thumb|Bromford Lane, West Bromwich.

West Bromwich's fortunes as a retail centre were affected by the Merry Hill development. This contributed to the closure of its [[Marks and Spencer]] store on 25 August 1990, along with the Dudley store, to be replaced by a new store at Merry Hill, with most of the staff at the new store being transferred from either West Bromwich or Dudley. [[British Home Stores]] also pulled out of the town around the same time, and a new store at Merry Hill which opened in November 1989 and also spelled the end of the Dudley store. The town lost another big retail name in 2005 when the [[Littlewoods]] store closed as part of the retailer's decision to switch wholly to online shopping; the unit has since been taken over by [[New Look (clothing retailer)|New Look]]. Retail developments around Oldbury, beginning with the [[SavaCentre]] hypermarket in 1980, have also affected trade in West Bromwich.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.propertyweek.com/a-little-extra-help/3066474.article|title=A little extra help|publisher=}}</ref> The [[Late 2000s recession|recession beginning in 2008]] has pushed the town centre further into decline, a notable casualty being the [[Woolworths Group|Woolworths]] store which closed on 30 December 2008 as a result of the retailer going into liquidation; the building was not re-occupied until [[Home Bargains]] took it over in 2012.\n\nSeveral more factories have closed in more recent years as manufacturers look to countries where the labour is cheaper, but West Bromwich remains a relatively busy industrial area despite the decline of the last 35 years.\n\n[[File:Forge Mill Lake, Sandwell Valley Country Park - geograph.org.uk - 1579402.jpg|thumb|Forge Mill Lake, Sandwell Valley Country Park]]\n\nWest Bromwich's road links were further enhanced in 1995 on the completion of the [[Black Country Spine Road]] which also by-passes Wednesbury and the east of [[Bilston]]. The completion of this new road opened up several square miles of previously inaccessible land, and has allowed several major businesses to set up along the route. This has helped relieve some of the unemployment problems in West Bromwich, although most parts of the town still have the highest unemployment rates in the West Midlands.\n\n===21st century===\nWest Bromwich was among the many towns and cities in England affected by the [[2011 England riots|widespread rioting]] in August 2011. On 9 August, shops closed their doors early to combat looting and vandalism; this was followed by widespread acts of vandalism and violence followed. Police closed the main roads leading into the town until the following morning.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/news/2011/08/10/masked-youths-rampage-through-west-bromwich/|title=Masked youths rampage through West Bromwich|website=www.expressandstar.com}}</ref>\n\nThe town has enjoyed something of an economic revival since 11 July 2013, when the New Square shopping and entertainment complex opened in the town centre on land adjoining the existing Queen's Square shopping centre. Hundreds of jobs have been created and the town has attracted retailers including Next, JD Sports, [[Primark]] and [[Bank Fashion]], as well as an [[Odeon Cinemas|Odeon cinema]], several food and drink outlets, and a Tesco Extra superstore.\n\nThe mixed success of [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.]] has also had a significant impact on the town's economy, particularly during the club's successful era of the 1960s and 1970s when it frequently competed in the top division of English football, won the [[FA Cup]] and qualified for European competitions on several occasions. Attendances were high during this era, but slumped during the 1980s when the club's on-the-field fortunes began to decline and culminated in relegation in 1986, at a time which the local economy had already suffered a sharp decline. Albion did not play in the top flight again until 2002, and remained a regular presence in the [[FA Premier League]] until 2018, during which time the club attracted a level of average attendance not seen since the late 1970s.\n\nThe archives for West Bromwich Borough are held at [[Sandwell Community History and Archives Service]].\n\n==Governance==\n[[File:westbromcrest.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The coat of arms of West Bromwich County Borough Council.]]\n\nThe town is divided into two constituencies; [[West Bromwich East (UK Parliament constituency)|West Bromwich East]] and [[West Bromwich West (UK Parliament constituency)|West Bromwich West]].\n\nWest Bromwich East is served by [[Nicola Richards]] ([[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]) who was elected on 12 December 2019.\n\nWest Bromwich West is served by [[Shaun Bailey (West Bromwich MP)|Shaun Bailey]] ([[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]) who was elected on 12 December 2019.

The club was founded in 1878 and in 1888 it became one of the 12 founder members of the [[The Football League|Football League]]. It won the [[Football League Championship|league championship]] in [[1919-20 Football League|1920]] and has won the [[FA Cup]] five times, most recently in [[1968 FA Cup Final|1968]],and won the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] in [[1965\u201366 Football League Cup|1966]]. Albion were based in and around the centre of West Bromwich during their formative years, but moved further out of the town in 1900 when they switched to their current ground, [[The Hawthorns]]. All traces of the original structures are long gone; the present structures were added to the stadium in 1979, 1994 and most recently 2001. At an altitude of 551 feet, The Hawthorns is the highest football ground (above sea level) in the country.\n\nEngineering and chemicals are important to the town's economy, as it played a crucial part in the [[Industrial Revolution]] during the 19th century and still retains many manufacturing jobs to this day, despite a steady nationwide decline in this sector since the 1970s.\n\n[[Sandwell General Hospital]] (on the site of the former Hallam Hospital) is located near the town centre. It is currently part of the [[Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust]], one of the largest NHS teaching trusts in the United Kingdom.\n\n[[File:Oakhouse.jpg|thumb|right|Oak House, West Bromwich.]]\n\n[[William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth]] had his seat at [[Sandwell Hall]]. Legge was unusual as an aristocrat of this period by being a [[Methodist]] and attending the [[Wednesbury]] Methodist meetings, where fellow Methodists \u2013 many of them [[colliery|collier]]s and [[droving|drover]]s \u2013 knew him as \"Brother Earl\".\n\n[[West Bromwich Town Hall]], situated in the centre of the High Street, is a Grade II listed building.  It was built between 1874 and 1875 in brick and stone to an Italian Gothic design, and its interior reflects the Victorian interest in Gothic and Medieval architecture.  Its Grand Organ, built in 1862, is considered to be of historic importance for its musical and technical qualities.<ref>http://www.westbromwichguide.110mb.com/the_town_hall.htm</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/place/place_page.jsp?p_id=914|title=History of West Bromwich, in Sandwell and Staffordshire \u2013 Map and description|website=www.visionofbritain.org.uk}}</ref>\n\n[[File:The Public Building.jpg|thumb|right|The Public, by Will Alsop]]\n\n[[West Bromwich Manor House]], Hall Green Road, was built by the de Marnham family in the late 13th century as the centre of their agricultural estate in West Bromwich only the Great Hall survives of the original complex of living quarters, agricultural barns, sheds and ponds. Successive occupants modernised and extended the Manor House until it was described in 1790 as \"a large pile of irregular half-timbered buildings, black and white, and surrounded with numerous out-houses and lofty walls.\"  The Manor House was saved from demolition in the 1950s by West Bromwich Corporation which carried out an extensive and sympathetic restoration of this nationally important building.\n\nThe [[Oak House, West Bromwich|Oak House]] is an historic building in the [[Greets Green]] area. Its exact date of origin is uncertain, but in 1634 it was owned by the Turtons. [[John Wesley]] preached there twice in the late 1700s. Reuben Farley gave it to the town as a museum, with the formal opening on 25 July 1898. In 1949 it was protected as a Grade II* Listed Building.\n\n[[File:Tame Sandwell Forge Mill.JPG|thumb|right|The lakes and pools within Sandwell Valley are home to a wide range of water fowl and also play host to migrating birds.]]\n\nIn August 2009, [[The Public, West Bromwich|The Public]] arts centre designed by architect Will Alsop fully opened. By 2013, the venue was attracting nearly 400,000 visitors a year and was bringing leading national and international artists to the town. Originally beset by problems before opening, in May 2013, it was revealed that Sandwell Council were considering borrowing a substantial amount of money to repurpose the \u00a370 million building and lease it to Sandwell College to provide a new sixth form centre to complement the recently opened Central Campus in the town.<ref>{{cite news|last=Haywood|first=Bob|title=Investors in The Public could be set to sue|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/local-news/investors-public-west-brom-could-3871460|newspaper=Birmingham Mail|date=19 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nA large portion of the town centre has been procured by [[Tesco]] for the development of a Tesco Extra store and shopping centre called [[New Square, West Bromwich]] which has been built on top of the old hospital. Since the early 2000s the tenants of homes and businesses have slowly moved out of the site to make way for the development.  Cronehills Primary School (staff and pupils) relocated to the newly built Eaton Valley Primary School, which opened in September 2009.  The police station relocated to a brand new building the other site of the ring road. Major works started on the site during October 2011 and the development was due to be complete by late spring 2013.\n\n[[Sandwell Valley]] contains [[Sandwell Valley Country Park]] and [[Sandwell Valley RSPB reserve|Sandwell Valley RSPB nature reserve]]. The 660 acre country park is located on the [[River Tame, West Midlands|River Tame]] in the middle of the urban [[conurbation]] between [[Birmingham]] and West Bromwich.

Other Christian denominations are present, including Roman Catholic, [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]], [[Methodist]], [[Baptist]], Elim [[Pentecostal]], [[Assemblies of God]] and other independent churches. The deanery of West Bromwich is under the Anglican [[Diocese of Lichfield]].\n\nWest Bromwich has four mosques. With two on Dartmouth street, one serving the Bangladeshi sunni community and the other, the Pakistani sunni community. The reason for the separate mosques is due to historic differences in opinions between imams of the berelvi community (Pakistani) and other sunni denominations. The largest mosque in West Bromwich is the Madinatul Uloon Al-Islamiyah Madrasa on Moor street which accommodates all Muslim Sunni denominations and follows the [[Deobandi]] school of thought. The fourth mosque opened in 2016 and follows the Bangladeshi [[fultoli]] teachings.\n\nThe Bangladeshi mosque on Dartmouth street (the Jami Masjid and Islamic Centre) is currently fundraising to rebuild a purpose built mosque to accommodate more worshippers. Currently, they have obtained the land they require for this rebuild but are lacking crucial funding required for the ambitious multi-million pound rebuild. The Jami Masjid and Islamic Centre was the first mosque in the area, of Bangladeshi origin. Madinatul Uloom Al-Islamiyah, located at Moor street is based at an abandoned church and was converted into a functioning mosque in 2001. The mosque also functions as a [[madrasa]], meaning that it offers taught classes and hosts Islamic events including an annual jalsa (Islamic gathering). It currently (and since 2003) offers Islamic evening classes to hundreds of children and has plans in the future to offer higher education to adults who desire to pursue Islamic studies at a higher level. The premises consists of two large prayer halls and an assortment of classrooms. This mosque is regularly attended by mostly people of Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Arab ethnicity (in order of proportions of worshippers from each ethnicity) - but what sets this mosque apart from others in West Bromwich, is that it is used regularly by people of many ethnicities, unlike other mosques in West Bromwich which are primarily used by people of one ethnicity.\n\nThere are also a large{{Vague|date=August 2011}} number of [[Sikh]]s in the area. There are many [[Gurudwara]]s. Sikhs have settled in the area since 1950, when the first influx of immigrants came. The oldest Gurdwara in West Bromwich is the Gurdwara Guru Har Rai Sahib Ji on High Street. Other Gurdwara's include Guru Nanak Gurdwara on Edward Street and Gurdwara Sachkhand Ishar Darbar on Vicarage Road.\n\n[[Hinduism|Hindus]] have had a formal place of worship in West Bromwich since the opening of the Shree Krishna Mandir<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skm-wb.org/|title=Shree Krishna Temple \u2013 West Bromwich|first=|last=TheThemeLab|website=www.skm-wb.org}}</ref> in 1974, in a converted church once called Ebenezer [[Congregational]] Chapel, which had closed in 1971.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=36168&strquery=west+bromwich|title=West Bromwich: Hindus \u2013 British History Online|website=www.british-history.ac.uk}}</ref> It was damaged by fire on 8 December 1992, the same date that a Mandir in Birmingham and another in Coventry were damaged in arson attacks.

Improvements are underway at A41 junction by West Bromwich town centre after a \u00a325 million project grant was awarded to the area to cut congestion for commuters. The junction, which is where The Expressway meets All saints way, currently carries over 60,000 vehicles a day, and is close to Junction 1 of the M5 The project involves the creation of a dual carriageway underpass, beneath an improved roundabout. This work began in June 2010 and should hopefully be completed in Autumn 2012. West Bromwich has its own bus station in the town centre, with connections to Birmingham and other major towns in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands region]].\n\n[[West Bromwich railway station]] was opened by the [[Great Western Railway]] on its [[Birmingham Snow Hill-Wolverhampton Low Level Line|route]] between [[Birmingham Snow Hill railway station|Birmingham Snow Hill]] and [[Wolverhampton Low Level railway station|Wolverhampton Low Level]] on 14 November 1854. The trackbed of that line is now served by the [[Midland Metro]] light rail (tram) system giving West Bromwich 7 tram stops: [[The Hawthorns tram stop]], [[Kenrick Park tram stop]], [[Trinity Way tram stop]], [[West Bromwich Central tram stop]], [[Lodge Road West Bromwich Town Hall tram stop]], [[Dartmouth Street tram stop]] and [[Dudley Street Guns Village tram stop]]. The nearest main-line railway station is now [[Sandwell & Dudley railway station]], approximately {{convert|1|mi|0}} away in [[Oldbury, West Midlands|Oldbury]] town centre.

There was previously a [[railway station|Newton Road railway station]] on Newton Road which was located a mile away from the town centre. It was on the Grand Junction Railway that ran from [[Birmingham New Street railway station|Birmingham New Street]] to [[Stafford railway station|Stafford]] via [[Wolverhampton railway station|Wolverhampton High Level]] and [[Walsall railway station|Walsall]]. This station closed in 1945 although it moved two times between 1863 and 1902, only the line remains in use for the services from Walsall to Birmingham, Wolverhampton and [[Liverpool Lime Street railway station|Liverpool Lime Street]].\n\nThe nearest airport which is approximately {{convert|16|mi|km}} away, is [[Birmingham Airport]], which can be reached by tram to [[Birmingham New Street railway station|Birmingham New Street]] and train to [[Birmingham International railway station|Birmingham International]].\n\nCarters Green, High Street and the beginning of Birmingham Road formed the original main route through West Bromwich as part of [[Thomas Telford]]'s London to [[Holyhead]] route in the early 19th century. This later formed part of the [[A41 road]] which links London with [[Merseyside]], taking in the midlands, [[Shropshire]], Warwickshire, [[Oxfordshire]], Buckinghamshire and [[Hertfordshire]] on the way. However, the route through central West Bromwich was by-passed in 1973 on the completion of the Expressway, a two-mile (3&nbsp;km) dual carriageway beginning at Carters Green and finishing at Junction 1 of the recently completed [[M5 motorway]] on Birmingham Road. The original A41 road through the centre of West Bromwich was downgraded to an unclassified route.\n\nAround this time, West Bromwich Ringway was opened, circulating the main shopping areas.\n\nFurther revolution came to the local road network in 1995 with the completion of the [[Black Country Spine Road]] which stretches from Carters Green to [[Bilston]] via [[Wednesbury]], forming another new section of the A41.\n\nWest Bromwich has a large [[West Bromwich bus station|bus station]] managed by [[Transport for West Midlands]] (previously [[West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive|Centro]]) and served by a large number of routes, both locally to places such as [[Oldbury, West Midlands|Oldbury]], [[Smethwick]] and [[Stone Cross]] as well as regional bus routes to places such as [[Birmingham]], [[Wolverhampton]] and [[Walsall]]. Stands are lettered a through to z. The main bus operators serving the bus station are [[National Express West Midlands]] and [[Diamond West Midlands]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nxbus.co.uk/local/west-midlands/?site%5Bsearch%5D=west+bromwich&show%5Broutes%5D=1|title=Local National Express West Midlands|website=nxbus.co.uk}}</ref><ref>http://diamondbuses.com/services/WestMidlands_5.html#westMidlandsTab</ref>\n\n==Education==\nThe largest educational provider in the town is the Central Campus of [[Sandwell College]]. This is housed in a \u00a377 million building opened in February 2012. The college is capable of enrolling over 5,000 students each year across many curriculum areas. Central Sixth delivers the college's A-Level programme covering some thirty different subject areas. Facilities in the Central Campus include a Boeing 737 fuselage used for training aircabin crew and a dental surgery used to train dental nurses. Central Campus also offers a wide variety of apprenticeships and a small number of Higher Education programmes.\n\nThe town is served by five secondary schools: [[George Salter Academy]], [[Health Futures UTC]], [[the Phoenix Collegiate]], [[Q3 Academy]] and [[Sandwell Academy]]. A new secondary school, West Bromwich Collegiate Academy, opened in September 2019.\n\nThe town has 21 primary schools in total. Some of which are [http://www.lodgeprimaryschool.co.uk Lodge Primary School], St. John Bosco RC Primary School,Ryders Green Primary School,  All Saints' CofE Primary School, St Mary Magdalene, Hateley Heath and Eaton Valley.\n\nSandwell Academy serves the whole of West Bromwich (along with the rest of Sandwell), Phoenix Collegiate Academy serves the area around [[Hateley Heath]], [[Tantany]], [[Charlemont and Grove Vale]] and [[Stone Cross, West Midlands]]. George Salter Academy serves the west of the town near the border with [[Tipton]]. Q3 Academy serves the north-eastern part of the town around [[Great Barr]].\n\nThe area was also served by Churchfields High School, approximately {{convert|1|mi|0}} to the north of the town centre. Due to constant closure rumours, less and less pupils began enrolling to attend the school and it was closed in July 2001. The site has since been redeveloped for housing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.school-index.co.uk/urn/104004.php|title=school-index.co.uk|website=www.school-index.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n[[File:The Three Degrees statue - New Square, West Bromwich (48488490306).jpg|thumb|upright|right|Statue of ''the Three Degrees'' by [[Graham Ibbeson]], in West Bromwich]]\n[[File:WBA The Great Escape.jpg|thumb|right|Fans spill onto [[the Hawthorns]] pitch following West Bromwich Albion's escape from relegation in 2005.]]\n\n==Sport==\n===Football===\nThe town's sport scene is dominated by [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], a football club who were founded in the town in 1878 by workers from [[Salter Housewares|George Salter's Spring Works]] in West Bromwich. They played at a number of sites near the town centre until they moved to their current home, [[The Hawthorns]] on Birmingham Road (on the borders of [[Smethwick]] and [[Handsworth, West Midlands|Handsworth]]) in 1900.\n\nWest Brom were among the 12 founder members of the [[Football League]] in 1888 (the first professional football league in the world), along with their two fiercest local rivals, [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]]. Albion have spent the majority of their existence in the top tier of English football.\n\nThe club has won nine major trophies; five [[FA Cup]]s (1888, 1892, 1931, 1954, 1968), one [[Football League Championship|league title]] title (1920), one [[Football League Cup]] (1966), and two [[FA Community Shield|Charity Shields]] (1920, 1954). The victory that came in 1968 was their most recent major trophy, when they won the FA Cup with a 1\u20130 win over [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]]. They enjoyed further success in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when they finished in the top five league positions three times in four seasons as well as reaching a [[UEFA Cup]] quarter-final. They currently play in the [[EFL Championship]], the second tier of English football, having been relegated from the [[Premier League]] in May 2018.\n\nNotable former players of West Bromwich Albion include [[Ronnie Allen]] (who later had two spells as the club's manager), [[Bryan Robson]] (who was also later the club's manager), [[Laurie Cunningham]] (the first black player to play for the senior [[England national football team|England national team]], but died in 1989 at age 33), [[Tony Brown (English footballer)|Tony Brown]] (the club's all-time leading goalscorer) and [[Jeff Astle]] (who scored the club's winning goal in the [[1968 FA Cup Final]] and remained a cult figure among Albion fans).\n\n===Cricket===\nThe local cricket team is [[West Bromwich Dartmouth Cricket Club]], and is based in the town.

It is believed that it may have originally been part of the [[Handsworth, West Midlands|Handsworth]] parish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=36165|title=West Bromwich: Churches \u2013 British History Online|website=www.british-history.ac.uk}}</ref> A [[Benedictine]] [[priory]] existed in West Bromwich from the 12th century around which the settlement of ''Broomwich Heath'' grew. In 1727, the town became a stop on the coaching road between London and [[Shrewsbury, Shropshire|Shrewsbury]] and the beginning of its growth dates from this time. The prefix 'West' serves to distinguish it from the village of [[Castle Bromwich]], around {{convert|8|mi|0}} to the east on the other side of Birmingham.\n\n===Development===\nIn the 19th century, coal deposits were discovered, ensuring that the town grew rapidly as an industrial centre, with industries such as spring, gun and nail making developing. Well before the end of the 19th century, West Bromwich had established itself as a prominent area to match older neighbouring towns including [[Dudley]] and [[Walsall]].\n\n{{Historical populations\n| source =<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/STS/WestBromwich/#Census|title=Genuki: West Bromwich, Staffordshire|first=|last=GENUKI|website=www.genuki.org.uk}}</ref>\n| 1801 | 5687\n| 1811 | 7485\n| 1821 | 9505\n| 1831 | 15377\n| 1841 | 26121\n| 1851 | 34581\n| 1861 | 41795\n| 1871 | 47918\n| 1881 | 56295\n| 1891 | 59538\n| 1901 | 65175\n| 1950 | 89000\n| 1991 | 146386\n}}\n\nIn 1888, West Bromwich became a [[county borough]], incorporating the village of [[Great Barr]]. It was expanded in 1966, acquiring most of the [[borough]] of [[Tipton]] and [[Wednesbury]] [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]] as well as a small section of [[Coseley]] urban district, before joining with the neighbouring county borough of [[County Borough of Warley|Warley]] (which contained the towns of [[Rowley Regis]], [[Oldbury, West Midlands|Oldbury]] and [[Smethwick]]) in 1974 to form the [[Metropolitan Borough of Sandwell]].\n\nCharlemont Hall, built during the 1750s, stood on the west side of the present Charlemont Crescent, in the [[Charlemont and Grove Vale]] district of the town. Charlemont Hall was described c. 1800 as \"a lofty neat-looking house of brick, faced with stone, with iron palisades etc. in front.\" An east wing was added in 1855. The last occupant was the widow of Thomas Jones, town clerk of Wednesbury 1897\u20131921. The house was demolished in 1948, and is now covered by a number of smaller detached homes. Much of the surrounding area was developed during the 1960s as the Charlemont Farm housing estate, which is a mix of private and [[Public housing in the United Kingdom|council housing]].\n\nThe population of West Bromwich suffered heavily in the [[Cholera epidemic of 1831]] which spread northwards into the town. A temporary board of health was set up and a hospital opened in the former Revivalist chapel in Spon Lane. The natural gradual slope of the land provided drainage within the soil, however, urbanisation made this increasingly difficult and drainage along the streets was described as inadequate. The [[West Bromwich Town Improvement Commissioners]] was established in 1854, and they tackled the drainage problem in the town. They appointed members to new titles and in the 1880s bought land in Friar Park for a sewerage farm.\n\nUnder the [[Reform Act 1832]], West Bromwich became part of the new southern division of [[Staffordshire]], and under the [[Reform Act 1867]] it was transferred to the parliamentary borough of Wednesbury.<ref name=\"BHO p history\">{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=36164&strquery=west+bromwich|title=West Bromwich: Parliamentary history \u2013 British History Online|website=www.british-history.ac.uk}}</ref> Under the [[Redistribution of Seats Act of 1885]], the borough of West Bromwich became a parliamentary borough returning one member. In 1885, it was held by the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] but from 1886 to 1906 it was held by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] before being held by the Liberal Party again until 1910 when the Conservative Party regained the area which they held until 1918 under the representation of [[Viscount Lewisham]].<ref name=\"BHO p history\" /> In 1918, it was won by [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] who have held it since, except for the period between 1931 and 1935 when it held by the [[National Unionist]]s.<ref name=\"BHO p history\" />\n\n[[File:West Bromwich Library.jpg|thumb|West Bromwich Library]]\n\n===20th century===\nBy the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, many of the older houses built to house workers during the [[Industrial Revolution]] were becoming unfit for human habitation{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}  Sanitation was inadequate, decay was rife, and the homes were becoming a danger to the health and safety of their inhabitants. After the end of the war, the local council started building new homes to rehouse people from the rundown town centre. However, there are still many late 19th century and early 20th century buildings around the centre of West Bromwich.\n\nThe first [[Council housing]] in West Bromwich was built in 1920 on the Tantany Estate to the north of the town centre. Within 20 years, several thousand council houses had been built by West Bromwich County Borough Council. The largest developments were mostly in the north of the town, including the Charlemont Farm Estate around Walsall Road, and the Friar Park Estate near the border with Wednesbury.<ref name=wbgt>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=36157|title=West Bromwich: The growth of the town \u2013 British History Online|website=www.british-history.ac.uk}}</ref>\n \n[[File:2015-03-07 - ThinkTank - Sasha Taylor - 03.JPG|thumb|World War II fund-raising badge, sold during \"War Weapons Week\", 15\u201322 March 1941]]\n\nThe town suffered significant damage from air raids in [[World War II]], with 58 civilian deaths, most in the raids of 19 November 1940 around Oak Road and Lombard Street to the west of the town centre. There were a few other less severe raids during the war on parts of West Bromwich including Stone Cross and Tantany, with no fatalities. This occurred on the same night as the [[Birmingham Blitz]], which resulted in thousands of casualties, as well as the less severe raids on nearby [[Dudley]] and [[Tipton]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/4005019/WEST%20BROMWICH,%20COUNTY%20BOROUGH|title=Cemetery}}</ref>\n\nThe first major postwar council housing development was the Harvills Hawthorn Estate near Hill Top, which was completed in 1948.<ref name=wbgt />\n\nMass immigration from the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] took place in West Bromwich during the 1950s and 1960s, with most of these hailing from the [[Indian subcontinent]], although a significant number of [[British African-Caribbean community|Afro-Caribbean]] immigrants also settled in West Bromwich. The majority of these immigrants settled in the older parts of the town that were mostly made up of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian period|Edwardian]] terraced houses.\n\nThe local road network was also massively improved during the 1960s and 1970s. West Bromwich is at the extreme northern end of the [[M5 motorway]], with junction 1 serving the town on the [[A41 road]]. Traffic passing through West Bromwich on the main route from [[Wolverhampton]] to [[Birmingham]] was soon diverted along the new dual carriageway, the ''Northern Loop Road'' (also known as ''The Expressway''), after its opening in 1972, with another dual carriageway being built to link The Expressway with neighbouring [[Oldbury, West Midlands|Oldbury]].\n\n[[File:The local government structure within the Black Country (Pre-1966).png|thumb|The local government structure within North Worcestershire and South Staffordshire \u2013 Prior to the ''West Midlands Order 1965'' reorganisation]]\n\nWest Bromwich County Borough was expanded in 1966 to include the bulk of [[Tipton]] and [[Wednesbury]], while a small part of the south-eastern section of the town was absorbed into the new [[Warley County Borough]] which was centered on neighbouring [[Oldbury, West Midlands|Oldbury]], [[Smethwick]] and [[Rowley Regis]]. The actual town boundaries of West Bromwich were also altered at this time, placing the Friar Park estate in Wednesbury, while the [[Hateley Heath]] area of Wednesbury was now within the borders of West Bromwich township.\n\nAs with many other parts of the [[English Midlands|Midlands]], West Bromwich was hit badly by the [[recession]]s of the mid-1970s and early 1980s, resulting in mass unemployment across the town, exceeding 20% in some districts.\n\nQueen's Square shopping centre opened in the town centre in 1971, providing shoppers with a 60-unit indoor shopping centre and an 850-space [[multi-storey car park]]. It cost \u00a33million to build.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queenssquaresc.co.uk/showPage.aspx?fldPageID=18|title=Queen's Square Shopping Centre<!-- Bot generated title -->|publisher=}}</ref> The smaller King's Square shopping centre also opened in the town in 1971.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.completelyretail.co.uk/scheme/Kings-Square-Sandwell-Centre-West-Bromwich/index.html|title=Kings Square Sandwell Centre, West Bromwich \u2013 Completely Retail|first=Completely|last=Group|website=www.completelyretail.co.uk}}</ref> On 8 December 2011, 40 years after the opening of Queen's Square, Sandwell Council announced that Queen's Square would be refurbished at a cost of \u00a35million. By this stage, the centre was falling into disrepair and only 33 of the 61 available units were occupied. Once again, West Bromwich had been hit hard by another [[Late 2000s recession|recession]], with local unemployment running high again, as well as a high vacancy rate for commercial and industrial units.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/news/2011/12/08/5m-revamp-for-west-bromwich-shopping-centre/|title=\u00a35m revamp for West Bromwich shopping centre|website=www.expressandstar.com}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bromford Lane, West Bromwich - geograph.org.uk - 107925.jpg|thumb|Bromford Lane, West Bromwich.

Steam trams ran along the road between 1885 and 1929.]]\n\nMany local towns, particularly Dudley, lost many of their major stores around the time that the [[Merry Hill Shopping Centre]] which was developed at [[Brierley Hill]] during the second half of the 1980s as businesses looked to take advantage of the [[Enterprise Zone]] incentives that the centre offered. West Bromwich's fortunes as a retail centre were affected by the Merry Hill development. This contributed to the closure of its [[Marks and Spencer]] store on 25 August 1990, along with the Dudley store, to be replaced by a new store at Merry Hill, with most of the staff at the new store being transferred from either West Bromwich or Dudley. [[British Home Stores]] also pulled out of the town around the same time, and a new store at Merry Hill which opened in November 1989 and also spelled the end of the Dudley store. The town lost another big retail name in 2005 when the [[Littlewoods]] store closed as part of the retailer's decision to switch wholly to online shopping; the unit has since been taken over by [[New Look (clothing retailer)|New Look]]. Retail developments around Oldbury, beginning with the [[SavaCentre]] hypermarket in 1980, have also affected trade in West Bromwich.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.propertyweek.com/a-little-extra-help/3066474.article|title=A little extra help|publisher=}}</ref> The [[Late 2000s recession|recession beginning in 2008]] has pushed the town centre further into decline, a notable casualty being the [[Woolworths Group|Woolworths]] store which closed on 30 December 2008 as a result of the retailer going into liquidation; the building was not re-occupied until [[Home Bargains]] took it over in 2012.\n\nSeveral more factories have closed in more recent years as manufacturers look to countries where the labour is cheaper, but West Bromwich remains a relatively busy industrial area despite the decline of the last 35 years.\n\n[[File:Forge Mill Lake, Sandwell Valley Country Park - geograph.org.uk - 1579402.jpg|thumb|Forge Mill Lake, Sandwell Valley Country Park]]\n\nWest Bromwich's road links were further enhanced in 1995 on the completion of the [[Black Country Spine Road]] which also by-passes Wednesbury and the east of [[Bilston]]. The completion of this new road opened up several square miles of previously inaccessible land, and has allowed several major businesses to set up along the route. This has helped relieve some of the unemployment problems in West Bromwich, although most parts of the town still have the highest unemployment rates in the West Midlands.\n\n===21st century===\nWest Bromwich was among the many towns and cities in England affected by the [[2011 England riots|widespread rioting]] in August 2011. On 9 August, shops closed their doors early to combat looting and vandalism; this was followed by widespread acts of vandalism and violence followed. Police closed the main roads leading into the town until the following morning.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/news/2011/08/10/masked-youths-rampage-through-west-bromwich/|title=Masked youths rampage through West Bromwich|website=www.expressandstar.com}}</ref>\n\nThe town has enjoyed something of an economic revival since 11 July 2013, when the New Square shopping and entertainment complex opened in the town centre on land adjoining the existing Queen's Square shopping centre. Hundreds of jobs have been created and the town has attracted retailers including Next, JD Sports, [[Primark]] and [[Bank Fashion]], as well as an [[Odeon Cinemas|Odeon cinema]], several food and drink outlets, and a Tesco Extra superstore.\n\nThe mixed success of [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.]] has also had a significant impact on the town's economy, particularly during the club's successful era of the 1960s and 1970s when it frequently competed in the top division of English football, won the [[FA Cup]] and qualified for European competitions on several occasions. Attendances were high during this era, but slumped during the 1980s when the club's on-the-field fortunes began to decline and culminated in relegation in 1986, at a time which the local economy had already suffered a sharp decline. Albion did not play in the top flight again until 2002, and remained a regular presence in the [[FA Premier League]] until 2018, during which time the club attracted a level of average attendance not seen since the late 1970s.\n\nThe archives for West Bromwich Borough are held at [[Sandwell Community History and Archives Service]].\n\n==Governance==\n[[File:westbromcrest.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The coat of arms of West Bromwich County Borough Council.]]\n\nThe town is divided into two constituencies; [[West Bromwich East (UK Parliament constituency)|West Bromwich East]] and [[West Bromwich West (UK Parliament constituency)|West Bromwich West]].\n\nWest Bromwich East is served by [[Nicola Richards]] ([[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]) who was elected on 12 December 2019.\n\nWest Bromwich West is served by [[Shaun Bailey (West Bromwich MP)|Shaun Bailey]] ([[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]) who was elected on 12 December 2019.

It won the [[Football League Championship|league championship]] in [[1919-20 Football League|1920]] and has won the [[FA Cup]] five times, most recently in [[1968 FA Cup Final|1968]],and won the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] in [[1965\u201366 Football League Cup|1966]]. Albion were based in and around the centre of West Bromwich during their formative years, but moved further out of the town in 1900 when they switched to their current ground, [[The Hawthorns]]. All traces of the original structures are long gone; the present structures were added to the stadium in 1979, 1994 and most recently 2001. At an altitude of 551 feet, The Hawthorns is the highest football ground (above sea level) in the country.\n\nEngineering and chemicals are important to the town's economy, as it played a crucial part in the [[Industrial Revolution]] during the 19th century and still retains many manufacturing jobs to this day, despite a steady nationwide decline in this sector since the 1970s.\n\n[[Sandwell General Hospital]] (on the site of the former Hallam Hospital) is located near the town centre. It is currently part of the [[Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust]], one of the largest NHS teaching trusts in the United Kingdom.\n\n[[File:Oakhouse.jpg|thumb|right|Oak House, West Bromwich.]]\n\n[[William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth]] had his seat at [[Sandwell Hall]]. Legge was unusual as an aristocrat of this period by being a [[Methodist]] and attending the [[Wednesbury]] Methodist meetings, where fellow Methodists \u2013 many of them [[colliery|collier]]s and [[droving|drover]]s \u2013 knew him as \"Brother Earl\".\n\n[[West Bromwich Town Hall]], situated in the centre of the High Street, is a Grade II listed building.  It was built between 1874 and 1875 in brick and stone to an Italian Gothic design, and its interior reflects the Victorian interest in Gothic and Medieval architecture.  Its Grand Organ, built in 1862, is considered to be of historic importance for its musical and technical qualities.<ref>http://www.westbromwichguide.110mb.com/the_town_hall.htm</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/place/place_page.jsp?p_id=914|title=History of West Bromwich, in Sandwell and Staffordshire \u2013 Map and description|website=www.visionofbritain.org.uk}}</ref>\n\n[[File:The Public Building.jpg|thumb|right|The Public, by Will Alsop]]\n\n[[West Bromwich Manor House]], Hall Green Road, was built by the de Marnham family in the late 13th century as the centre of their agricultural estate in West Bromwich only the Great Hall survives of the original complex of living quarters, agricultural barns, sheds and ponds. Successive occupants modernised and extended the Manor House until it was described in 1790 as \"a large pile of irregular half-timbered buildings, black and white, and surrounded with numerous out-houses and lofty walls.\"  The Manor House was saved from demolition in the 1950s by West Bromwich Corporation which carried out an extensive and sympathetic restoration of this nationally important building.\n\nThe [[Oak House, West Bromwich|Oak House]] is an historic building in the [[Greets Green]] area. Its exact date of origin is uncertain, but in 1634 it was owned by the Turtons. [[John Wesley]] preached there twice in the late 1700s. Reuben Farley gave it to the town as a museum, with the formal opening on 25 July 1898. In 1949 it was protected as a Grade II* Listed Building.\n\n[[File:Tame Sandwell Forge Mill.JPG|thumb|right|The lakes and pools within Sandwell Valley are home to a wide range of water fowl and also play host to migrating birds.]]\n\nIn August 2009, [[The Public, West Bromwich|The Public]] arts centre designed by architect Will Alsop fully opened. By 2013, the venue was attracting nearly 400,000 visitors a year and was bringing leading national and international artists to the town. Originally beset by problems before opening, in May 2013, it was revealed that Sandwell Council were considering borrowing a substantial amount of money to repurpose the \u00a370 million building and lease it to Sandwell College to provide a new sixth form centre to complement the recently opened Central Campus in the town.<ref>{{cite news|last=Haywood|first=Bob|title=Investors in The Public could be set to sue|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/local-news/investors-public-west-brom-could-3871460|newspaper=Birmingham Mail|date=19 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nA large portion of the town centre has been procured by [[Tesco]] for the development of a Tesco Extra store and shopping centre called [[New Square, West Bromwich]] which has been built on top of the old hospital. Since the early 2000s the tenants of homes and businesses have slowly moved out of the site to make way for the development.  Cronehills Primary School (staff and pupils) relocated to the newly built Eaton Valley Primary School, which opened in September 2009.  The police station relocated to a brand new building the other site of the ring road. Major works started on the site during October 2011 and the development was due to be complete by late spring 2013.\n\n[[Sandwell Valley]] contains [[Sandwell Valley Country Park]] and [[Sandwell Valley RSPB reserve|Sandwell Valley RSPB nature reserve]]. The 660 acre country park is located on the [[River Tame, West Midlands|River Tame]] in the middle of the urban [[conurbation]] between [[Birmingham]] and West Bromwich. The [[RSPB]] nature reserve is adjacent, and attracts over 150 different bird species.<ref name=\"Forbes\">{{cite book|last1=Forbes|first1=Peter|last2=Hackett|first2=Peter|last3=Hextell|first3=Tim|title=Birds of the Sandwell Valley|year=2000|publisher=Sandwell Valley Naturalists' Club|isbn=978-0951153222}}</ref> There are also two farms on the site that are open to the public: Sandwell Park Farm and Forge Mill Farm.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==Religion==\nWest Bromwich is a culturally diverse area with many places of worship for several different religions.\n\nThe [[Church of England]] provides the most places of worship across the geographically wider [[West Bromwich Deanery]] (taking in West Bromwich, Hill Top, Stone Cross, Carter's Green, Holy Trinity, All Saint's, St Andrew's, St Francis, Friar Park and others) which contains nine [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] churches. Other Christian denominations are present, including Roman Catholic, [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]], [[Methodist]], [[Baptist]], Elim [[Pentecostal]], [[Assemblies of God]] and other independent churches. The deanery of West Bromwich is under the Anglican [[Diocese of Lichfield]].\n\nWest Bromwich has four mosques. With two on Dartmouth street, one serving the Bangladeshi sunni community and the other, the Pakistani sunni community. The reason for the separate mosques is due to historic differences in opinions between imams of the berelvi community (Pakistani) and other sunni denominations. The largest mosque in West Bromwich is the Madinatul Uloon Al-Islamiyah Madrasa on Moor street which accommodates all Muslim Sunni denominations and follows the [[Deobandi]] school of thought. The fourth mosque opened in 2016 and follows the Bangladeshi [[fultoli]] teachings.\n\nThe Bangladeshi mosque on Dartmouth street (the Jami Masjid and Islamic Centre) is currently fundraising to rebuild a purpose built mosque to accommodate more worshippers. Currently, they have obtained the land they require for this rebuild but are lacking crucial funding required for the ambitious multi-million pound rebuild. The Jami Masjid and Islamic Centre was the first mosque in the area, of Bangladeshi origin. Madinatul Uloom Al-Islamiyah, located at Moor street is based at an abandoned church and was converted into a functioning mosque in 2001. The mosque also functions as a [[madrasa]], meaning that it offers taught classes and hosts Islamic events including an annual jalsa (Islamic gathering). It currently (and since 2003) offers Islamic evening classes to hundreds of children and has plans in the future to offer higher education to adults who desire to pursue Islamic studies at a higher level. The premises consists of two large prayer halls and an assortment of classrooms. This mosque is regularly attended by mostly people of Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Arab ethnicity (in order of proportions of worshippers from each ethnicity) - but what sets this mosque apart from others in West Bromwich, is that it is used regularly by people of many ethnicities, unlike other mosques in West Bromwich which are primarily used by people of one ethnicity.\n\nThere are also a large{{Vague|date=August 2011}} number of [[Sikh]]s in the area. There are many [[Gurudwara]]s. Sikhs have settled in the area since 1950, when the first influx of immigrants came. The oldest Gurdwara in West Bromwich is the Gurdwara Guru Har Rai Sahib Ji on High Street. Other Gurdwara's include Guru Nanak Gurdwara on Edward Street and Gurdwara Sachkhand Ishar Darbar on Vicarage Road.\n\n[[Hinduism|Hindus]] have had a formal place of worship in West Bromwich since the opening of the Shree Krishna Mandir<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skm-wb.org/|title=Shree Krishna Temple \u2013 West Bromwich|first=|last=TheThemeLab|website=www.skm-wb.org}}</ref> in 1974, in a converted church once called Ebenezer [[Congregational]] Chapel, which had closed in 1971.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=36168&strquery=west+bromwich|title=West Bromwich: Hindus \u2013 British History Online|website=www.british-history.ac.uk}}</ref> It was damaged by fire on 8 December 1992, the same date that a Mandir in Birmingham and another in Coventry were damaged in arson attacks.

Improvements are underway at A41 junction by West Bromwich town centre after a \u00a325 million project grant was awarded to the area to cut congestion for commuters. The junction, which is where The Expressway meets All saints way, currently carries over 60,000 vehicles a day, and is close to Junction 1 of the M5 The project involves the creation of a dual carriageway underpass, beneath an improved roundabout. This work began in June 2010 and should hopefully be completed in Autumn 2012. West Bromwich has its own bus station in the town centre, with connections to Birmingham and other major towns in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands region]].\n\n[[West Bromwich railway station]] was opened by the [[Great Western Railway]] on its [[Birmingham Snow Hill-Wolverhampton Low Level Line|route]] between [[Birmingham Snow Hill railway station|Birmingham Snow Hill]] and [[Wolverhampton Low Level railway station|Wolverhampton Low Level]] on 14 November 1854. The trackbed of that line is now served by the [[Midland Metro]] light rail (tram) system giving West Bromwich 7 tram stops: [[The Hawthorns tram stop]], [[Kenrick Park tram stop]], [[Trinity Way tram stop]], [[West Bromwich Central tram stop]], [[Lodge Road West Bromwich Town Hall tram stop]], [[Dartmouth Street tram stop]] and [[Dudley Street Guns Village tram stop]]. The nearest main-line railway station is now [[Sandwell & Dudley railway station]], approximately {{convert|1|mi|0}} away in [[Oldbury, West Midlands|Oldbury]] town centre. Though services to [[Stourbridge Junction railway station|Stourbridge Junction]], [[Worcester Shrub Hill railway station|Worcester Shrub Hill]], [[Worcester Foregate Street railway station|Worcester Foregate Street]], and [[Birmingham Snow Hill railway station|Birmingham Snow Hill]], [[Birmingham Moor Street railway station|Birmingham Moor Street]] call at [[The Hawthorns railway station]]. There was previously a [[railway station|Newton Road railway station]] on Newton Road which was located a mile away from the town centre. It was on the Grand Junction Railway that ran from [[Birmingham New Street railway station|Birmingham New Street]] to [[Stafford railway station|Stafford]] via [[Wolverhampton railway station|Wolverhampton High Level]] and [[Walsall railway station|Walsall]]. This station closed in 1945 although it moved two times between 1863 and 1902, only the line remains in use for the services from Walsall to Birmingham, Wolverhampton and [[Liverpool Lime Street railway station|Liverpool Lime Street]].\n\nThe nearest airport which is approximately {{convert|16|mi|km}} away, is [[Birmingham Airport]], which can be reached by tram to [[Birmingham New Street railway station|Birmingham New Street]] and train to [[Birmingham International railway station|Birmingham International]].\n\nCarters Green, High Street and the beginning of Birmingham Road formed the original main route through West Bromwich as part of [[Thomas Telford]]'s London to [[Holyhead]] route in the early 19th century. This later formed part of the [[A41 road]] which links London with [[Merseyside]], taking in the midlands, [[Shropshire]], Warwickshire, [[Oxfordshire]], Buckinghamshire and [[Hertfordshire]] on the way. However, the route through central West Bromwich was by-passed in 1973 on the completion of the Expressway, a two-mile (3&nbsp;km) dual carriageway beginning at Carters Green and finishing at Junction 1 of the recently completed [[M5 motorway]] on Birmingham Road. The original A41 road through the centre of West Bromwich was downgraded to an unclassified route.\n\nAround this time, West Bromwich Ringway was opened, circulating the main shopping areas.\n\nFurther revolution came to the local road network in 1995 with the completion of the [[Black Country Spine Road]] which stretches from Carters Green to [[Bilston]] via [[Wednesbury]], forming another new section of the A41.\n\nWest Bromwich has a large [[West Bromwich bus station|bus station]] managed by [[Transport for West Midlands]] (previously [[West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive|Centro]]) and served by a large number of routes, both locally to places such as [[Oldbury, West Midlands|Oldbury]], [[Smethwick]] and [[Stone Cross]] as well as regional bus routes to places such as [[Birmingham]], [[Wolverhampton]] and [[Walsall]]. Stands are lettered a through to z. The main bus operators serving the bus station are [[National Express West Midlands]] and [[Diamond West Midlands]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nxbus.co.uk/local/west-midlands/?site%5Bsearch%5D=west+bromwich&show%5Broutes%5D=1|title=Local National Express West Midlands|website=nxbus.co.uk}}</ref><ref>http://diamondbuses.com/services/WestMidlands_5.html#westMidlandsTab</ref>\n\n==Education==\nThe largest educational provider in the town is the Central Campus of [[Sandwell College]]. This is housed in a \u00a377 million building opened in February 2012. The college is capable of enrolling over 5,000 students each year across many curriculum areas. Central Sixth delivers the college's A-Level programme covering some thirty different subject areas. Facilities in the Central Campus include a Boeing 737 fuselage used for training aircabin crew and a dental surgery used to train dental nurses. Central Campus also offers a wide variety of apprenticeships and a small number of Higher Education programmes.\n\nThe town is served by five secondary schools: [[George Salter Academy]], [[Health Futures UTC]], [[the Phoenix Collegiate]], [[Q3 Academy]] and [[Sandwell Academy]]. A new secondary school, West Bromwich Collegiate Academy, opened in September 2019.\n\nThe town has 21 primary schools in total. Some of which are [http://www.lodgeprimaryschool.co.uk Lodge Primary School], St. John Bosco RC Primary School,Ryders Green Primary School,  All Saints' CofE Primary School, St Mary Magdalene, Hateley Heath and Eaton Valley.\n\nSandwell Academy serves the whole of West Bromwich (along with the rest of Sandwell), Phoenix Collegiate Academy serves the area around [[Hateley Heath]], [[Tantany]], [[Charlemont and Grove Vale]] and [[Stone Cross, West Midlands]]. George Salter Academy serves the west of the town near the border with [[Tipton]]. Q3 Academy serves the north-eastern part of the town around [[Great Barr]].\n\nThe area was also served by Churchfields High School, approximately {{convert|1|mi|0}} to the north of the town centre. Due to constant closure rumours, less and less pupils began enrolling to attend the school and it was closed in July 2001. The site has since been redeveloped for housing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.school-index.co.uk/urn/104004.php|title=school-index.co.uk|website=www.school-index.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n[[File:The Three Degrees statue - New Square, West Bromwich (48488490306).jpg|thumb|upright|right|Statue of ''the Three Degrees'' by [[Graham Ibbeson]], in West Bromwich]]\n[[File:WBA The Great Escape.jpg|thumb|right|Fans spill onto [[the Hawthorns]] pitch following West Bromwich Albion's escape from relegation in 2005.]]\n\n==Sport==\n===Football===\nThe town's sport scene is dominated by [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], a football club who were founded in the town in 1878 by workers from [[Salter Housewares|George Salter's Spring Works]] in West Bromwich. They played at a number of sites near the town centre until they moved to their current home, [[The Hawthorns]] on Birmingham Road (on the borders of [[Smethwick]] and [[Handsworth, West Midlands|Handsworth]]) in 1900.\n\nWest Brom were among the 12 founder members of the [[Football League]] in 1888 (the first professional football league in the world), along with their two fiercest local rivals, [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]]. Albion have spent the majority of their existence in the top tier of English football.\n\nThe club has won nine major trophies; five [[FA Cup]]s (1888, 1892, 1931, 1954, 1968), one [[Football League Championship|league title]] title (1920), one [[Football League Cup]] (1966), and two [[FA Community Shield|Charity Shields]] (1920, 1954). The victory that came in 1968 was their most recent major trophy, when they won the FA Cup with a 1\u20130 win over [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]]. They enjoyed further success in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when they finished in the top five league positions three times in four seasons as well as reaching a [[UEFA Cup]] quarter-final. They currently play in the [[EFL Championship]], the second tier of English football, having been relegated from the [[Premier League]] in May 2018.\n\nNotable former players of West Bromwich Albion include [[Ronnie Allen]] (who later had two spells as the club's manager), [[Bryan Robson]] (who was also later the club's manager), [[Laurie Cunningham]] (the first black player to play for the senior [[England national football team|England national team]], but died in 1989 at age 33), [[Tony Brown (English footballer)|Tony Brown]] (the club's all-time leading goalscorer) and [[Jeff Astle]] (who scored the club's winning goal in the [[1968 FA Cup Final]] and remained a cult figure among Albion fans).\n\n===Cricket===\nThe local cricket team is [[West Bromwich Dartmouth Cricket Club]], and is based in the town. The club was founded in 1834. It is a founder member of the [[Birmingham and District Premier League|Birmingham and District Cricket League]], the oldest cricket league in the world.

There is evidence for schoolboys playing a \"football\" ball game in Aberdeen in 1633 (some references cite 1636) which is notable as an early allusion to what some have considered to be passing the ball. The word \"pass\" in the most recent translation is derived from \"huc percute\" (strike it here) and later \"repercute pilam\" (strike the ball again) in the original Latin. It is not certain that the ball was being struck between members of the same team. The original word translated as \"goal\" is \"metum\", literally meaning the \"pillar at each end of the circus course\" in a Roman chariot race. There is a reference to \"get hold of the ball before [another player] does\" (Praeripe illi pilam si possis agere) suggesting that handling of the ball was allowed. One sentence states in the original 1930 translation \"Throw yourself against him\" (Age, objice te illi).\n\nKing [[Henry IV of England]] also presented one of the earliest documented uses of the English word \"football\", in 1409, when he issued a proclamation forbidding the levying of money for \"foteball\".<ref name=Magoun/><ref name=Etymology>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=football |title=Online Etymology Dictionary (no date), \"football\" |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=19 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628050902/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=football |archive-date=28 June 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThere is also an account in [[Latin]] from the end of the 15th century of football being played at [[Caunton|Caunton, Nottinghamshire]].

For example, ''calcio'' players could punch, shoulder charge, and kick opponents. Blows below the belt were allowed. The game is said to have originated as a military training exercise. In 1580, Count Giovanni de' Bardi di Vernio wrote ''Discorso sopra 'l giuoco del Calcio Fiorentino''. This is sometimes said to be the earliest code of rules for any football game.

Female footballers still face similar problems in some parts of the world.\n\n== Establishment of modern codes ==\n\n=== English public schools ===\n{{Main|English public school football games}}\nWhile football continued to be played in various forms throughout Britain, its [[public school (England)|public schools]] (equivalent to private schools in other countries) are widely credited with four key achievements in the creation of modern football codes. First of all, the evidence suggests that they were important in taking football away from its \"mob\" form and turning it into an organised team sport. Second, many early descriptions of football and references to it were recorded by people who had studied at these schools. Third, it was teachers, students and former students from these schools who first codified football games, to enable matches to be played between schools. Finally, it was at English public schools that the division between \"kicking\" and \"running\" (or \"carrying\") games first became clear.\n\nThe earliest evidence that games resembling football were being played at English public schools \u2013 mainly attended by boys from the upper, upper-middle and professional classes \u2013 comes from the ''Vulgaria'' by William Herman in 1519. Herman had been headmaster at [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[Winchester College|Winchester]] colleges and his [[Latin]] textbook includes a translation exercise with the phrase \"We wyll playe with a ball full of wynde\".<ref>A history of Winchester College. by Arthur F Leach.

Mulcaster's writings refer to teams (\"sides\" and \"parties\"), positions (\"standings\"), a referee (\"judge over the parties\") and a coach \"(trayning maister)\". Mulcaster's \"footeball\" had evolved from the disordered and violent forms of traditional football:\n\n{{quote|[s]ome smaller number with such overlooking, sorted into sides and standings, not meeting with their bodies so boisterously to trie their strength: nor shouldring or shuffing one an other so barbarously ... may use footeball for as much good to the body, by the chiefe use of the legges.<ref>\nFrancis Peabody Magoun.

Players were not allowed to pass the ball forward, either by foot or by hand. They could only dribble with their feet, or advance the ball in a ''[[Scrum (rugby)|scrum]]'' or similar ''formation''. However, offside laws began to diverge and develop differently at each school, as is shown by the rules of football from Winchester, [[Rugby School|Rugby]], [[Harrow School|Harrow]] and [[Cheltenham School|Cheltenham]], during between 1810 and 1850.<ref name=Carosi/> The first known codes \u2013 in the sense of a set of rules \u2013 were those of Eton in 1815<ref name=\"Richard William Cox 2002 243\">{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of British Football |first=Richard William |last=Cox |first2=Dave |last2=Russell |first3=Wray |last3=Vamplew |publisher=Routledge |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-7146-5249-8 |page=243 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JKbb02bg6zYC |access-date=23 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325125959/https://books.google.com/books?id=JKbb02bg6zYC |archive-date=25 March 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> and [[Aldenham]] in 1825.<ref name=\"Richard William Cox 2002 243\"/>)\n\nDuring the early 19th century, most working class people in Britain had to work six days a week, often for over twelve hours a day. They had neither the time nor the inclination to engage in sport for recreation and, at the time, many [[Child labour#Industrial Revolution|children were part of the labour force]]. [[Feast day]] football played on the streets was in decline. Public school boys, who enjoyed some freedom from work, became the inventors of organised football games with formal codes of rules.\n\nFootball was adopted by a number of public schools as a way of encouraging competitiveness and keeping youths fit. Each school drafted its own rules, which varied widely between different schools and were changed over time with each new intake of pupils. Two schools of thought developed regarding rules. Some schools favoured a game in which the ball could be carried (as at Rugby, [[Marlborough College|Marlborough]] and Cheltenham), while others preferred a game where kicking and dribbling the ball was promoted (as at Eton, Harrow, [[Westminster School|Westminster]] and [[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]]). The division into these two camps was partly the result of circumstances in which the games were played. For example, Charterhouse and Westminster at the time had restricted playing areas; the boys were confined to playing their ball game within the school [[cloisters]], making it difficult for them to adopt rough and tumble running games.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009|reason=For the whole paragraph}}\n\n[[File:Rugby School 850.jpg|thumb|Although the [[Rugby School]] (pictured) became famous due to a version that [[rugby football]] was invented there in 1823, most sports historians refuse this version stating it is apocryphal]]\n[[William Webb Ellis]], a pupil at Rugby School, is said to have \"with a fine disregard for the rules of football, ''as played in his time'' [emphasis added], first took the ball in his arms and ran with it, thus creating the distinctive feature of the rugby game.\" in 1823. This act is usually said to be the beginning of [[Rugby football]], but there is little evidence that it occurred, and most sports historians believe the story to be apocryphal. The act of 'taking the ball in his arms' is often misinterpreted as 'picking the ball up' as it is widely believed that Webb Ellis' 'crime' was handling the ball, as in modern association football, however handling the ball at the time was often permitted and in some cases compulsory,<ref>example of ball handling in early football from English writer [[William Hone]], writing in 1825 or 1826, quotes the social commentator Sir [[Frederick Morton Eden]], regarding \"Foot-Ball\", as played at [[Scone, Scotland]], Scotland:\n:''The game was this: he who at any time got the ball into his hands, run [sic] with it till overtaken by one of the opposite part; and then, if he could shake himself loose from those on the opposite side who seized him, he run on; if not, he threw the ball from him, unless it was wrested from him by the other party'', but no person was allowed to kick it.

Inter-school sporting competitions became possible. However, it was difficult for schools to play each other at football, as each school played by its own rules. The solution to this problem was usually that the match be divided into two halves, one half played by the rules of the host \"home\" school, and the other half by the visiting \"away\" school.\n\nThe ''modern'' rules of many football codes were formulated during the mid- or late- 19th century. This also applies to other sports such as lawn bowls, lawn tennis, etc. The major impetus for this was the patenting of the world's first [[lawnmower]] in 1830. This allowed for the preparation of modern ovals, playing fields, pitches, grass courts, etc.<ref>ABC Radio National ''Ockham's Razor'', first broadcast 6 June 2010.</ref>\n\nApart from Rugby football, the public school codes have barely been played beyond the confines of each school's playing fields. However, many of them are still played at the schools which created them (see [[Football#Surviving UK school games|Surviving UK school games]] below).\n\n[[File:The Football Game.

Before 1850, many British children had to work six days a week, for more than twelve hours a day. From 1850, they could not work before 6&nbsp;a.m. (7&nbsp;a.m. in winter) or after 6&nbsp;p.m. on weekdays (7&nbsp;p.m. in winter); on Saturdays they had to cease work at 2&nbsp;p.m. These changes meant that working class children had more time for games, including various forms of football.\n\nThe earliest known matches between public schools are as follows:\n[[File:Foot Ball, Kingston-upon-Thames, Shrove Tuesday, Feb. 24th, 1846.jpg|thumb|230px|Football match in the 1846 [[Shrove Tuesday]] in [[Kingston upon Thames]], [[England]]]]\n* 9 December 1834: Eton School v.

The code was largely independent of the public school rules, the most significant difference being the lack of an ''offside'' rule.\n\nThe code was responsible for many innovations that later spread to association football. These included [[wikt:free kick|free kick]]s, [[corner kick]]s, handball, [[throw-in]]s and the crossbar.<ref>{{cite book |first=Brendan |last=Murphy |title=From Sheffield with Love |year=2007 |pages=41\u201343 |publisher=Sports Book Limited |isbn=978-1-899807-56-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D9PVkQEACAAJ }}</ref> By the 1870s they became the dominant code in the north and midlands of England.

The origins of an organised game of football known today as Australian rules football can be traced back to 1858 in [[Melbourne]], the capital city of [[Victoria (state)|Victoria]].\n\nIn July 1858, [[Tom Wills]], an Australian-born cricketer educated at [[Rugby School]] in England, wrote a letter to ''[[Bell's Life in Victoria|Bell's Life in Victoria & Sporting Chronicle]]'', calling for a \"foot-ball club\" with a \"code of laws\" to keep cricketers fit during winter.<ref>{{cite web |title=Letter from Tom Wills |work=MCG website |url=http://www.mcg.org.au/default.asp?pg=footballdisplay&articleid=37 |accessdate=14 July 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060625081726/http://www.mcg.org.au/default.asp?pg=footballdisplay&articleid=37 |archivedate=25 June 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This is considered by historians to be a defining moment in the creation of Australian rules football.

One week later, Wills umpired a schoolboys match between [[Melbourne Grammar School]] and [[Scotch College (Melbourne)|Scotch College]]. Following these matches, organised football in Melbourne rapidly increased in popularity.\n\n[[File:Australianfootball1866.jpg|thumb|Wood engraving of an Australian rules football match at the [[Yarra Park|Richmond Paddock]], [[Melbourne]], 1866]]\nWills and others involved in these early matches formed the [[Melbourne Football Club]] (the oldest surviving Australian football club) on 14 May 1859. Club members Wills, [[William Hammersley]], [[J. B. Thompson]] and [[Thomas H. Smith]] met with the intention of forming a set of rules that would be widely adopted by other clubs. The committee debated rules used in English public school games; Wills pushed for various [[rugby football]] rules he learnt during his schooling. The first rules share similarities with these games, and were shaped to suit to Australian conditions. [[H. C. A. Harrison]], a seminal figure in Australian football, recalled that his cousin Wills wanted \"a game of our own\".<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Hibbins |first1=Gillian |last2=Mancini |first2=Anne |title=Running with the Ball: Football's Foster Father |publisher=Lynedoch Publications |year=1987 |pages=118\u2013119 |isbn=978-0-7316-0481-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oR3wAAAAMAAJ }}</ref> The code was distinctive in the prevalence of the [[Mark (Australian football)|mark]], [[Free kick (Australian rules football)|free kick]], [[Tackle (football move)#Australian rules football|tackling]], lack of an offside rule and that players were specifically penalised for [[Handball (Australian rules football)|throwing the ball]].\n\nThe Melbourne football rules were widely distributed and gradually adopted by the other Victorian clubs. The rules were updated several times during the 1860s to accommodate the rules of other influential Victorian football clubs. A significant redraft in 1866 by H. C. A. Harrison's committee accommodated the [[Geelong Football Club]]'s rules, making the game then known as \"Victorian Rules\" increasingly distinct from other codes. It soon adopted cricket fields and an oval ball, used specialised goal and behind posts, and featured [[running bounce|bouncing the ball while running]] and [[specky|spectacular high marking]]. The game spread quickly to other [[Australian states and territories|Australian colonies]]. Outside its heartland in southern Australia, the code experienced a significant period of decline following World War I but has since grown throughout Australia and in [[Australian football around the world|other parts of the world]], and the [[Australian Football League]] emerged as the dominant professional competition.\n\n=== Football Association ===\n{{Main|The Football Association}}\n\n{{multiple image\n| perrow = 4\n| total_width = 600\n | image1 = 1872_engl_v_scotland_ralston.jpg\n | width1 =  \n | alt1 =  \n | image2 = 1872_engl_v_scotland-2.jpg\n | alt2 =\n | width2 =  \n | image3 = 1872_engl_v_scotland-3.jpg\n | alt3 =\n | width3 =  \n | image4 = 1872_engl_v_scotland-4.jpg\n | width4 =  \n | footer = The first [[Association football|football]] international, [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] versus [[England national football team|England]]. Once kept by the [[Rugby Football Union]] as an early example of [[rugby football]].\n}}\n\nDuring the early 1860s, there were increasing attempts in England to unify and reconcile the various public school games. In 1862, J. C. Thring, who had been one of the driving forces behind the original Cambridge Rules, was a master at [[Uppingham School]] and he issued his own rules of what he called \"The Simplest Game\" (these are also known as the Uppingham Rules). In early October 1863 another new revised version of the Cambridge Rules was drawn up by a seven member committee representing former pupils from Harrow, Shrewsbury, Eton, Rugby, Marlborough and Westminster.\n\nAt the [[Freemasons' Tavern]], Great Queen Street, London on the evening of 26 October 1863, representatives of several football clubs in the [[County of London|London Metropolitan area]] met for the inaugural meeting of [[The Football Association]] (FA). The aim of the Association was to establish a single unifying code and regulate the playing of the game among its members. Following the first meeting, the public schools were invited to join the association. All of them declined, except Charterhouse and Uppingham. In total, six meetings of the FA were held between October and December 1863. After the third meeting, a draft set of rules were published. However, at the beginning of the fourth meeting, attention was drawn to the recently published Cambridge Rules of 1863. The Cambridge rules differed from the draft FA rules in two significant areas; namely running with (carrying) the ball and [[hacking (rugby)|hacking]] (kicking opposing players in the shins). The two contentious FA rules were as follows:\n\n{{quote|IX. A player shall be entitled to run with the ball towards his adversaries' goal if he makes a fair catch, or catches the ball on the first bound; but in case of a fair catch, if he makes his mark he shall not run.<br /><!--Leave it here: two rules, two lines. -->\nX. If any player shall run with the ball towards his adversaries' goal, any player on the opposite side shall be at liberty to charge, hold, trip or hack him, or to wrest the ball from him, but no player shall be held and hacked at the same time.<ref>Peter Shortell.

Most of the delegates supported this, but [[F. M. Campbell]], the representative from [[Blackheath Rugby Club|Blackheath]] and the first FA treasurer, objected. He said: \"hacking is the true football\". However, the motion to ban running with the ball in hand and hacking was carried and Blackheath withdrew from the FA. After the final meeting on 8 December, the FA published the \"[[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of Football]]\", the first comprehensive set of rules for the game later known as Association Football. The term \"soccer\", in use since the late 19th century, derives from an [[Oxford \"-er\"|Oxford University abbreviation]] of \"Association\".<ref name=OEDsoccer>{{cite journal |date=June 2011 |title=soccer, n |journal=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/183733 |accessdate=1 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe first FA rules still contained elements that are no longer part of association football, but which are still recognisable in other games (such as Australian football and rugby football): for instance, a player could make a fair catch and claim a ''[[Mark (Australian football)|mark]]'', which entitled him to a free kick; and if a player touched the ball behind the opponents' goal line, his side was entitled to a ''free kick'' at goal, from 15&nbsp;yards (13.5&nbsp;metres) in front of the goal line.\n\n=== Rugby football ===\n{{Main|History of rugby union}}\n[[File:Last scrimmage buckman.jpg|thumb|''The Last Scrimmage'' by Edwin Buckman, depicting a rugby scrum in 1871]]\nIn [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], by 1870, there were 49 clubs playing variations of the Rugby school game.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/timeline1870s.htm|title=Rugby Football History|website=rugbyfootballhistory.com|access-date=7 November 2019}}</ref> There were also \"rugby\" clubs in Ireland, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. However, there was no generally accepted set of rules for rugby until 1871, when 21 clubs from London came together to form the [[Rugby Football Union]] (RFU).

One observer, Father W. Ferris, described two main forms of ''caid'' during this period: the \"field game\" in which the object was to put the ball through arch-like goals, formed from the boughs of two trees; and the epic \"cross-country game\" which took up most of the daylight hours of a Sunday on which it was played, and was won by one team taking the ball across a parish boundary. \"Wrestling\", \"holding\" opposing players, and carrying the ball were all allowed.\n\nBy the 1870s, Rugby and Association football had started to become popular in Ireland. [[Trinity College Dublin]] was an early stronghold of Rugby (see the [[Football#Other developments in the 1850s|Developments in the 1850s]] section, above). The rules of the English FA were being distributed widely. Traditional forms of ''caid'' had begun to give way to a \"rough-and-tumble game\" which allowed tripping.\n\nThere was no serious attempt to unify and codify Irish varieties of football, until the establishment of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA) in 1884. The GAA sought to promote traditional Irish sports, such as [[hurling]] and to reject imported games like Rugby and Association football. The first Gaelic football rules were drawn up by [[Maurice Davin]] and published in the ''United Ireland'' magazine on 7 February 1887.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://usgaa.org/gaelic-football/|title=Gaelic Football|website=USGAA|access-date=7 November 2019}}</ref> Davin's rules showed the influence of games such as hurling and a desire to formalise a distinctly Irish code of football. The prime example of this differentiation was the lack of an offside rule (an attribute which, for many years, was shared only by other Irish games like hurling, and by Australian rules football).\n\n=== Schism in Rugby football ===\n[[File:Reverend marshall.jpg|thumb|An English cartoon from the 1890s lampooning the divide in rugby football which led to the formation of [[rugby league]]. The caricatures are of Rev. Frank Marshall, an arch-opponent of player payments, and James Miller, a long-time opponent of Marshall. The caption reads:\n\nMarshall: \"Oh, fie, go away naughty boy, I don't play with boys who can\u2019t afford to take a holiday for football any day they like!\"\n\nMiller: \"Yes, that's just you to a T; you\u2019d make it so that no lad whose father wasn\u2019t a millionaire could play at all in a really good team. For my part I see no reason why the men who make the money shouldn\u2019t have a share in the spending of it.\"]]\n{{Further|History of rugby league}}\nThe [[International Rugby Board|International Rugby Football Board]] (IRFB) was founded in 1886<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.world.rugby/news/204311?lang=en|title=IRFB Formed|last=worldrugby.org|website=world.rugby|access-date=7 November 2019}}</ref>, but rifts were beginning to emerge in the code. [[professional sports|Professionalism]] had already begun to creep into the various codes of football.\n\nIn England, by the 1890s, a long-standing [[Rugby Football Union]] ban on ''professional'' players was causing regional tensions within rugby football, as many players in northern England were working class and could not afford to take time off to train, travel, play and recover from injuries. This was not very different from what had occurred ten years earlier in soccer in Northern England but the authorities reacted very differently in the RFU, attempting to alienate the working class support in Northern England. In 1895, following a dispute about a player being paid broken time payments, which replaced wages lost as a result of playing rugby, representatives of the northern clubs met in [[Huddersfield]] to form the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Rugby Football Union]] (NRFU). The new body initially permitted only various types of player wage replacements. However, within two years, NRFU players could be paid, but they were required to have a job outside sport.\n\nThe demands of a professional league dictated that rugby had to become a better \"spectator\" sport. Within a few years the NRFU rules had started to diverge from the RFU, most notably with the abolition of the ''[[line-out (rugby union)|line-out]]''. This was followed by the replacement of the ''[[Playing rugby union#Ruck|ruck]]'' with the \"play-the-ball ruck\", which allowed a two-player ruck contest between the tackler at marker and the player tackled. ''[[Rugby union gameplay#Maul|Mauls]]'' were stopped once the ball carrier was held, being replaced by a play-the ball-ruck. The separate Lancashire and Yorkshire competitions of the NRFU merged in 1901, forming the Northern Rugby League, the first time the name [[rugby league]] was used officially in England.\n\nOver time, the RFU form of rugby, played by clubs which remained members of national federations affiliated to the IRFB, became known as [[rugby union]].\n\n=== Globalisation of association football ===\n{{Main|History of FIFA}}\nThe need for a single body to oversee association football had become apparent by the beginning of the 20th century, with the increasing popularity of international fixtures. The English Football Association had chaired many discussions on setting up an international body, but was perceived as making no progress. It fell to associations from seven other European countries: France, Belgium, Denmark, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland, to form an international association. The ''F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association'' ([[FIFA]]) was founded in Paris on 21 May 1904.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/who-we-are/history/index.html|title=History of FIFA - Foundation|last=FIFA.com|publisher=FIFA|access-date=7 November 2019}}</ref> Its first president was [[Robert Gu\u00e9rin]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/who-we-are/history/index.html|title=History of FIFA - Foundation|last=FIFA.com|publisher=FIFA|access-date=7 November 2019}}</ref> The French name and acronym has remained, even outside French-speaking countries.\n\n=== Further divergence of the two rugby codes ===\nRugby league rules diverged significantly from rugby union in 1906, with the reduction of the team from 15 to 13 players. In 1907, a New Zealand professional rugby team toured Australia and Britain, receiving an enthusiastic response, and professional [[rugby league in Australia|rugby leagues were launched in Australia]] the following year. However, the rules of professional games varied from one country to another, and negotiations between various national bodies were required to fix the exact rules for each international match. This situation endured until 1948, when at the instigation of the French league, the [[Rugby League International Federation]] (RLIF) was formed at a meeting in [[Bordeaux]].\n\nDuring the second half of the 20th century, the rules changed further. In 1966, rugby league officials borrowed the American football concept of ''[[Down (football)|downs]]'': a team was allowed to retain possession of the ball for four tackles (rugby union retains the original rule that a player who is tackled and brought to the ground must release the ball immediately).  The maximum number of tackles was later increased to six (in 1971), and in rugby league this became known as the [[Playing rugby league#Six tackle rule|''six tackle rule'']].\n\nWith the advent of full-time professionals in the early 1990s, and the consequent speeding up of the game, the five metre off-side distance between the two teams became 10&nbsp;metres, and the replacement rule was superseded by various interchange rules, among other changes.\n\nThe laws of rugby union also changed during the 20th century, although less significantly than those of rugby league. In particular, goals from ''[[mark (rugby)|marks]]'' were abolished, kicks directly ''[[Touch (rugby)|into touch]]'' from outside the ''[[Rugby pitch|22 metre]]'' line were penalised, new laws were put in place to determine who had possession following an inconclusive ''[[Ruck (Rugby union)|ruck]]'' or ''[[Rugby union gameplay#Maul|maul]]'', and the lifting of players in ''[[line-out (rugby union)|line-out]]s'' was legalised.\n\nIn 1995, rugby union became an \"open\" game, that is one which allowed professional players.<ref>{{cite web |title=History of the RFU |url=http://www.rfu.com/AboutTheRFU/History.aspx |publisher=[[Rugby Football Union]] |accessdate=28 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100422210444/http://www.rfu.com/AboutTheRFU/History.aspx |archivedate=22 April 2010}}</ref> Although the original dispute between the two codes has now disappeared \u2013 and despite the fact that officials from both forms of rugby football have sometimes mentioned the possibility of re-unification \u2013 the rules of both codes and their culture have diverged to such an extent that such an event is unlikely in the foreseeable future.\n\n== Use of the word \"football\" ==\n{{details|Football (word)}}\nThe word ''football'', when used in reference to a specific game can mean any one of those described above. Because of this, much friendly controversy has occurred over the term ''football'', primarily because it is used in different ways in different parts of the [[English-speaking world]]. Most often, the word \"football\" is used to refer to the code of football that is considered dominant within a particular region. So, effectively, what the word \"football\" means usually depends on where one says it.\n[[File:The Sportsman 1910-11-25 Football.png|thumb|Heading from The Sportsman (London) front page of 25 November 1910, illustrating the continued use of the word \"football\" to encompass both association football and rugby]]\nIn each of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada, one football code is known solely as \"football\", while the others generally require a qualifier. In New Zealand, \"football\" historically referred to [[rugby union]], but more recently may be used unqualified to refer to association football. The sport meant by the word \"football\" in Australia is either [[Australian rules football]] or [[rugby league]], depending on local popularity (which largely conforms to the [[Barassi Line]]). In [[francophone]] [[Quebec]], where [[Canadian football]] is more popular, the Canadian code is known as {{lang|fr|le football}} while American football is known as {{lang|fr|le football am\u00e9ricain}} and association football is known as {{lang|fr|le soccer}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.federation-soccer.qc.ca/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=149&Itemid=34 |title=The governing body is the \"F\u00e9d\u00e9ration de soccer du Qu\u00e9bec\" |publisher=Federation-soccer.qc.ca |accessdate=16 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304192131/http://www.federation-soccer.qc.ca/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=149&Itemid=34 |archivedate=4 March 2012 }}</ref> \n\nOf the 45 national [[FIFA]] (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association) affiliates in which English is an official or primary language, most currently use ''Football'' in their organisations' official names; the FIFA affiliates in [[Canadian Soccer Association|Canada]] and the [[United States Soccer Federation|United States]] use ''Soccer'' in their names.

There is evidence for schoolboys playing a \"football\" ball game in Aberdeen in 1633 (some references cite 1636) which is notable as an early allusion to what some have considered to be passing the ball. The word \"pass\" in the most recent translation is derived from \"huc percute\" (strike it here) and later \"repercute pilam\" (strike the ball again) in the original Latin. It is not certain that the ball was being struck between members of the same team. The original word translated as \"goal\" is \"metum\", literally meaning the \"pillar at each end of the circus course\" in a Roman chariot race. There is a reference to \"get hold of the ball before [another player] does\" (Praeripe illi pilam si possis agere) suggesting that handling of the ball was allowed. One sentence states in the original 1930 translation \"Throw yourself against him\" (Age, objice te illi).\n\nKing [[Henry IV of England]] also presented one of the earliest documented uses of the English word \"football\", in 1409, when he issued a proclamation forbidding the levying of money for \"foteball\".<ref name=Magoun/><ref name=Etymology>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=football |title=Online Etymology Dictionary (no date), \"football\" |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=19 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628050902/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=football |archive-date=28 June 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThere is also an account in [[Latin]] from the end of the 15th century of football being played at [[Caunton|Caunton, Nottinghamshire]].

For example, ''calcio'' players could punch, shoulder charge, and kick opponents. Blows below the belt were allowed. The game is said to have originated as a military training exercise. In 1580, Count Giovanni de' Bardi di Vernio wrote ''Discorso sopra 'l giuoco del Calcio Fiorentino''. This is sometimes said to be the earliest code of rules for any football game. The game was not played after January 1739 (until it was revived in May 1930).\n\n=== Official disapproval and attempts to ban football ===\n{{Main|Attempts to ban football games}}\nThere have been many attempts to ban football, from the [[middle ages]] through to the modern day.

Female footballers still face similar problems in some parts of the world.\n\n== Establishment of modern codes ==\n\n=== English public schools ===\n{{Main|English public school football games}}\nWhile football continued to be played in various forms throughout Britain, its [[public school (England)|public schools]] (equivalent to private schools in other countries) are widely credited with four key achievements in the creation of modern football codes. First of all, the evidence suggests that they were important in taking football away from its \"mob\" form and turning it into an organised team sport. Second, many early descriptions of football and references to it were recorded by people who had studied at these schools. Third, it was teachers, students and former students from these schools who first codified football games, to enable matches to be played between schools. Finally, it was at English public schools that the division between \"kicking\" and \"running\" (or \"carrying\") games first became clear.\n\nThe earliest evidence that games resembling football were being played at English public schools \u2013 mainly attended by boys from the upper, upper-middle and professional classes \u2013 comes from the ''Vulgaria'' by William Herman in 1519. Herman had been headmaster at [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[Winchester College|Winchester]] colleges and his [[Latin]] textbook includes a translation exercise with the phrase \"We wyll playe with a ball full of wynde\".<ref>A history of Winchester College. by Arthur F Leach.

Mulcaster's writings refer to teams (\"sides\" and \"parties\"), positions (\"standings\"), a referee (\"judge over the parties\") and a coach \"(trayning maister)\". Mulcaster's \"footeball\" had evolved from the disordered and violent forms of traditional football:\n\n{{quote|[s]ome smaller number with such overlooking, sorted into sides and standings, not meeting with their bodies so boisterously to trie their strength: nor shouldring or shuffing one an other so barbarously ... may use footeball for as much good to the body, by the chiefe use of the legges.<ref>\nFrancis Peabody Magoun.

Wedderburn refers to what has been translated into modern English as \"keeping goal\" and makes an allusion to passing the ball (\"strike it here\"). There is a reference to \"get hold of the ball\", suggesting that some handling was allowed. It is clear that the tackles allowed included the charging and holding of opposing players (\"drive that man back\").<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Shared Origins of Football, Rugby, and Soccer |last=Rowley |first=Christopher |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |year=2015 |isbn=9781442246195 |location= |pages=86 |via=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HmBoCgAAQBAJ }}</ref>\n\nA more detailed description of football is given in [[Francis Willughby]]'s ''Book of Games'', written in about 1660.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P-io9DcBllkC&pg=PA168&lpg=PA168&vq=football&dq=willughby+book+of+sports |title=Francis Willughby, 1660\u201372, '&#39;Book of Games'&#39; |publisher= |date= |accessdate=19 June 2010 |isbn=978-1-85928-460-5 |year=2003}}</ref> Willughby, who had studied at [[Bishop Vesey's Grammar School]], [[Sutton Coldfield]], is the first to describe goals and a distinct playing field: \"a close that has a gate at either end.

He also mentions tactics (\"leaving some of their best players to guard the goal\"); scoring (\"they that can strike the ball through their opponents' goal first win\") and the way teams were selected (\"the players being equally divided according to their strength and nimbleness\"). He is the first to describe a \"law\" of football: \"they must not strike [an opponent's leg] higher than the ball\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://spartacus-educational.com/Fpublic.htm|title=Football in Public Schools|website=Spartacus Educational|access-date=7 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Emmerson|first=Craig|title=the role of the public schools in the development of sport in the nineteenth century|url=https://www.academia.edu/7298549/the_role_of_the_public_schools_in_the_development_of_sport_in_the_nineteenth_century}}</ref>\n\nEnglish public schools were the first to codify football games. In particular, they devised the first ''[[offside (sport)|offside]]'' rules, during the late 18th century.<ref name=Carosi>{{Cite web |url=http://www.kenaston.org/download/KenAstonRefereeSociety/offside_history-JulianCarosi.pdf |title=Julian Carosi, 2006, \"The History of Offside\" |access-date=5 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502105003/http://www.kenaston.org/download/KenAstonRefereeSociety/offside_history-JulianCarosi.pdf |archive-date=2 May 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> In the earliest manifestations of these rules, players were \"off their side\" if they simply stood between the ball and the goal which was their objective. Players were not allowed to pass the ball forward, either by foot or by hand. They could only dribble with their feet, or advance the ball in a ''[[Scrum (rugby)|scrum]]'' or similar ''formation''. However, offside laws began to diverge and develop differently at each school, as is shown by the rules of football from Winchester, [[Rugby School|Rugby]], [[Harrow School|Harrow]] and [[Cheltenham School|Cheltenham]], during between 1810 and 1850.<ref name=Carosi/> The first known codes \u2013 in the sense of a set of rules \u2013 were those of Eton in 1815<ref name=\"Richard William Cox 2002 243\">{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of British Football |first=Richard William |last=Cox |first2=Dave |last2=Russell |first3=Wray |last3=Vamplew |publisher=Routledge |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-7146-5249-8 |page=243 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JKbb02bg6zYC |access-date=23 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325125959/https://books.google.com/books?id=JKbb02bg6zYC |archive-date=25 March 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> and [[Aldenham]] in 1825.<ref name=\"Richard William Cox 2002 243\"/>)\n\nDuring the early 19th century, most working class people in Britain had to work six days a week, often for over twelve hours a day. They had neither the time nor the inclination to engage in sport for recreation and, at the time, many [[Child labour#Industrial Revolution|children were part of the labour force]]. [[Feast day]] football played on the streets was in decline. Public school boys, who enjoyed some freedom from work, became the inventors of organised football games with formal codes of rules.\n\nFootball was adopted by a number of public schools as a way of encouraging competitiveness and keeping youths fit. Each school drafted its own rules, which varied widely between different schools and were changed over time with each new intake of pupils. Two schools of thought developed regarding rules. Some schools favoured a game in which the ball could be carried (as at Rugby, [[Marlborough College|Marlborough]] and Cheltenham), while others preferred a game where kicking and dribbling the ball was promoted (as at Eton, Harrow, [[Westminster School|Westminster]] and [[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]]). The division into these two camps was partly the result of circumstances in which the games were played. For example, Charterhouse and Westminster at the time had restricted playing areas; the boys were confined to playing their ball game within the school [[cloisters]], making it difficult for them to adopt rough and tumble running games.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009|reason=For the whole paragraph}}\n\n[[File:Rugby School 850.jpg|thumb|Although the [[Rugby School]] (pictured) became famous due to a version that [[rugby football]] was invented there in 1823, most sports historians refuse this version stating it is apocryphal]]\n[[William Webb Ellis]], a pupil at Rugby School, is said to have \"with a fine disregard for the rules of football, ''as played in his time'' [emphasis added], first took the ball in his arms and ran with it, thus creating the distinctive feature of the rugby game.\" in 1823. This act is usually said to be the beginning of [[Rugby football]], but there is little evidence that it occurred, and most sports historians believe the story to be apocryphal. The act of 'taking the ball in his arms' is often misinterpreted as 'picking the ball up' as it is widely believed that Webb Ellis' 'crime' was handling the ball, as in modern association football, however handling the ball at the time was often permitted and in some cases compulsory,<ref>example of ball handling in early football from English writer [[William Hone]], writing in 1825 or 1826, quotes the social commentator Sir [[Frederick Morton Eden]], regarding \"Foot-Ball\", as played at [[Scone, Scotland]], Scotland:\n:''The game was this: he who at any time got the ball into his hands, run [sic] with it till overtaken by one of the opposite part; and then, if he could shake himself loose from those on the opposite side who seized him, he run on; if not, he threw the ball from him, unless it was wrested from him by the other party'', but no person was allowed to kick it.

Inter-school sporting competitions became possible. However, it was difficult for schools to play each other at football, as each school played by its own rules. The solution to this problem was usually that the match be divided into two halves, one half played by the rules of the host \"home\" school, and the other half by the visiting \"away\" school.\n\nThe ''modern'' rules of many football codes were formulated during the mid- or late- 19th century. This also applies to other sports such as lawn bowls, lawn tennis, etc. The major impetus for this was the patenting of the world's first [[lawnmower]] in 1830. This allowed for the preparation of modern ovals, playing fields, pitches, grass courts, etc.<ref>ABC Radio National ''Ockham's Razor'', first broadcast 6 June 2010.</ref>\n\nApart from Rugby football, the public school codes have barely been played beyond the confines of each school's playing fields. However, many of them are still played at the schools which created them (see [[Football#Surviving UK school games|Surviving UK school games]] below).\n\n[[File:The Football Game. Thomas Webster, 1839, 1.jpg|thumb|300px|''A Football Game'' (1839) by British painter [[Thomas Webster (painter)|Thomas Webster]]]]\nPublic schools' dominance of sports in the UK began to wane after the [[Factory Act 1850|''Factory Act'' of 1850]], which significantly increased the recreation time available to working class children. Before 1850, many British children had to work six days a week, for more than twelve hours a day. From 1850, they could not work before 6&nbsp;a.m. (7&nbsp;a.m. in winter) or after 6&nbsp;p.m. on weekdays (7&nbsp;p.m. in winter); on Saturdays they had to cease work at 2&nbsp;p.m. These changes meant that working class children had more time for games, including various forms of football.\n\nThe earliest known matches between public schools are as follows:\n[[File:Foot Ball, Kingston-upon-Thames, Shrove Tuesday, Feb. 24th, 1846.jpg|thumb|230px|Football match in the 1846 [[Shrove Tuesday]] in [[Kingston upon Thames]], [[England]]]]\n* 9 December 1834: Eton School v.

The code was largely independent of the public school rules, the most significant difference being the lack of an ''offside'' rule.\n\nThe code was responsible for many innovations that later spread to association football. These included [[wikt:free kick|free kick]]s, [[corner kick]]s, handball, [[throw-in]]s and the crossbar.<ref>{{cite book |first=Brendan |last=Murphy |title=From Sheffield with Love |year=2007 |pages=41\u201343 |publisher=Sports Book Limited |isbn=978-1-899807-56-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D9PVkQEACAAJ }}</ref> By the 1870s they became the dominant code in the north and midlands of England.

The origins of an organised game of football known today as Australian rules football can be traced back to 1858 in [[Melbourne]], the capital city of [[Victoria (state)|Victoria]].\n\nIn July 1858, [[Tom Wills]], an Australian-born cricketer educated at [[Rugby School]] in England, wrote a letter to ''[[Bell's Life in Victoria|Bell's Life in Victoria & Sporting Chronicle]]'', calling for a \"foot-ball club\" with a \"code of laws\" to keep cricketers fit during winter.<ref>{{cite web |title=Letter from Tom Wills |work=MCG website |url=http://www.mcg.org.au/default.asp?pg=footballdisplay&articleid=37 |accessdate=14 July 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060625081726/http://www.mcg.org.au/default.asp?pg=footballdisplay&articleid=37 |archivedate=25 June 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This is considered by historians to be a defining moment in the creation of Australian rules football.

One week later, Wills umpired a schoolboys match between [[Melbourne Grammar School]] and [[Scotch College (Melbourne)|Scotch College]]. Following these matches, organised football in Melbourne rapidly increased in popularity.\n\n[[File:Australianfootball1866.jpg|thumb|Wood engraving of an Australian rules football match at the [[Yarra Park|Richmond Paddock]], [[Melbourne]], 1866]]\nWills and others involved in these early matches formed the [[Melbourne Football Club]] (the oldest surviving Australian football club) on 14 May 1859. Club members Wills, [[William Hammersley]], [[J. B. Thompson]] and [[Thomas H. Smith]] met with the intention of forming a set of rules that would be widely adopted by other clubs. The committee debated rules used in English public school games; Wills pushed for various [[rugby football]] rules he learnt during his schooling. The first rules share similarities with these games, and were shaped to suit to Australian conditions. [[H. C. A. Harrison]], a seminal figure in Australian football, recalled that his cousin Wills wanted \"a game of our own\".<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Hibbins |first1=Gillian |last2=Mancini |first2=Anne |title=Running with the Ball: Football's Foster Father |publisher=Lynedoch Publications |year=1987 |pages=118\u2013119 |isbn=978-0-7316-0481-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oR3wAAAAMAAJ }}</ref> The code was distinctive in the prevalence of the [[Mark (Australian football)|mark]], [[Free kick (Australian rules football)|free kick]], [[Tackle (football move)#Australian rules football|tackling]], lack of an offside rule and that players were specifically penalised for [[Handball (Australian rules football)|throwing the ball]].\n\nThe Melbourne football rules were widely distributed and gradually adopted by the other Victorian clubs. The rules were updated several times during the 1860s to accommodate the rules of other influential Victorian football clubs. A significant redraft in 1866 by H. C. A. Harrison's committee accommodated the [[Geelong Football Club]]'s rules, making the game then known as \"Victorian Rules\" increasingly distinct from other codes. It soon adopted cricket fields and an oval ball, used specialised goal and behind posts, and featured [[running bounce|bouncing the ball while running]] and [[specky|spectacular high marking]]. The game spread quickly to other [[Australian states and territories|Australian colonies]]. Outside its heartland in southern Australia, the code experienced a significant period of decline following World War I but has since grown throughout Australia and in [[Australian football around the world|other parts of the world]], and the [[Australian Football League]] emerged as the dominant professional competition.\n\n=== Football Association ===\n{{Main|The Football Association}}\n\n{{multiple image\n| perrow = 4\n| total_width = 600\n | image1 = 1872_engl_v_scotland_ralston.jpg\n | width1 =  \n | alt1 =  \n | image2 = 1872_engl_v_scotland-2.jpg\n | alt2 =\n | width2 =  \n | image3 = 1872_engl_v_scotland-3.jpg\n | alt3 =\n | width3 =  \n | image4 = 1872_engl_v_scotland-4.jpg\n | width4 =  \n | footer = The first [[Association football|football]] international, [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] versus [[England national football team|England]]. Once kept by the [[Rugby Football Union]] as an early example of [[rugby football]].\n}}\n\nDuring the early 1860s, there were increasing attempts in England to unify and reconcile the various public school games. In 1862, J. C. Thring, who had been one of the driving forces behind the original Cambridge Rules, was a master at [[Uppingham School]] and he issued his own rules of what he called \"The Simplest Game\" (these are also known as the Uppingham Rules). In early October 1863 another new revised version of the Cambridge Rules was drawn up by a seven member committee representing former pupils from Harrow, Shrewsbury, Eton, Rugby, Marlborough and Westminster.\n\nAt the [[Freemasons' Tavern]], Great Queen Street, London on the evening of 26 October 1863, representatives of several football clubs in the [[County of London|London Metropolitan area]] met for the inaugural meeting of [[The Football Association]] (FA). The aim of the Association was to establish a single unifying code and regulate the playing of the game among its members. Following the first meeting, the public schools were invited to join the association. All of them declined, except Charterhouse and Uppingham. In total, six meetings of the FA were held between October and December 1863. After the third meeting, a draft set of rules were published. However, at the beginning of the fourth meeting, attention was drawn to the recently published Cambridge Rules of 1863. The Cambridge rules differed from the draft FA rules in two significant areas; namely running with (carrying) the ball and [[hacking (rugby)|hacking]] (kicking opposing players in the shins). The two contentious FA rules were as follows:\n\n{{quote|IX. A player shall be entitled to run with the ball towards his adversaries' goal if he makes a fair catch, or catches the ball on the first bound; but in case of a fair catch, if he makes his mark he shall not run.<br /><!--Leave it here: two rules, two lines. -->\nX. If any player shall run with the ball towards his adversaries' goal, any player on the opposite side shall be at liberty to charge, hold, trip or hack him, or to wrest the ball from him, but no player shall be held and hacked at the same time.<ref>Peter Shortell.

Most of the delegates supported this, but [[F. M. Campbell]], the representative from [[Blackheath Rugby Club|Blackheath]] and the first FA treasurer, objected. He said: \"hacking is the true football\". However, the motion to ban running with the ball in hand and hacking was carried and Blackheath withdrew from the FA. After the final meeting on 8 December, the FA published the \"[[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of Football]]\", the first comprehensive set of rules for the game later known as Association Football. The term \"soccer\", in use since the late 19th century, derives from an [[Oxford \"-er\"|Oxford University abbreviation]] of \"Association\".<ref name=OEDsoccer>{{cite journal |date=June 2011 |title=soccer, n |journal=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/183733 |accessdate=1 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe first FA rules still contained elements that are no longer part of association football, but which are still recognisable in other games (such as Australian football and rugby football): for instance, a player could make a fair catch and claim a ''[[Mark (Australian football)|mark]]'', which entitled him to a free kick; and if a player touched the ball behind the opponents' goal line, his side was entitled to a ''free kick'' at goal, from 15&nbsp;yards (13.5&nbsp;metres) in front of the goal line.\n\n=== Rugby football ===\n{{Main|History of rugby union}}\n[[File:Last scrimmage buckman.jpg|thumb|''The Last Scrimmage'' by Edwin Buckman, depicting a rugby scrum in 1871]]\nIn [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], by 1870, there were 49 clubs playing variations of the Rugby school game.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/timeline1870s.htm|title=Rugby Football History|website=rugbyfootballhistory.com|access-date=7 November 2019}}</ref> There were also \"rugby\" clubs in Ireland, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. However, there was no generally accepted set of rules for rugby until 1871, when 21 clubs from London came together to form the [[Rugby Football Union]] (RFU). The first official RFU rules were adopted in June 1871.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.englandrugby.com/about-rfu/the-rfu|title=RFU|website=englandrugby.com|access-date=7 November 2019}}</ref> These rules allowed passing the ball.

One observer, Father W. Ferris, described two main forms of ''caid'' during this period: the \"field game\" in which the object was to put the ball through arch-like goals, formed from the boughs of two trees; and the epic \"cross-country game\" which took up most of the daylight hours of a Sunday on which it was played, and was won by one team taking the ball across a parish boundary. \"Wrestling\", \"holding\" opposing players, and carrying the ball were all allowed.\n\nBy the 1870s, Rugby and Association football had started to become popular in Ireland. [[Trinity College Dublin]] was an early stronghold of Rugby (see the [[Football#Other developments in the 1850s|Developments in the 1850s]] section, above). The rules of the English FA were being distributed widely. Traditional forms of ''caid'' had begun to give way to a \"rough-and-tumble game\" which allowed tripping.\n\nThere was no serious attempt to unify and codify Irish varieties of football, until the establishment of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA) in 1884. The GAA sought to promote traditional Irish sports, such as [[hurling]] and to reject imported games like Rugby and Association football. The first Gaelic football rules were drawn up by [[Maurice Davin]] and published in the ''United Ireland'' magazine on 7 February 1887.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://usgaa.org/gaelic-football/|title=Gaelic Football|website=USGAA|access-date=7 November 2019}}</ref> Davin's rules showed the influence of games such as hurling and a desire to formalise a distinctly Irish code of football. The prime example of this differentiation was the lack of an offside rule (an attribute which, for many years, was shared only by other Irish games like hurling, and by Australian rules football).\n\n=== Schism in Rugby football ===\n[[File:Reverend marshall.jpg|thumb|An English cartoon from the 1890s lampooning the divide in rugby football which led to the formation of [[rugby league]]. The caricatures are of Rev. Frank Marshall, an arch-opponent of player payments, and James Miller, a long-time opponent of Marshall. The caption reads:\n\nMarshall: \"Oh, fie, go away naughty boy, I don't play with boys who can\u2019t afford to take a holiday for football any day they like!\"\n\nMiller: \"Yes, that's just you to a T; you\u2019d make it so that no lad whose father wasn\u2019t a millionaire could play at all in a really good team. For my part I see no reason why the men who make the money shouldn\u2019t have a share in the spending of it.\"]]\n{{Further|History of rugby league}}\nThe [[International Rugby Board|International Rugby Football Board]] (IRFB) was founded in 1886<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.world.rugby/news/204311?lang=en|title=IRFB Formed|last=worldrugby.org|website=world.rugby|access-date=7 November 2019}}</ref>, but rifts were beginning to emerge in the code. [[professional sports|Professionalism]] had already begun to creep into the various codes of football.\n\nIn England, by the 1890s, a long-standing [[Rugby Football Union]] ban on ''professional'' players was causing regional tensions within rugby football, as many players in northern England were working class and could not afford to take time off to train, travel, play and recover from injuries. This was not very different from what had occurred ten years earlier in soccer in Northern England but the authorities reacted very differently in the RFU, attempting to alienate the working class support in Northern England. In 1895, following a dispute about a player being paid broken time payments, which replaced wages lost as a result of playing rugby, representatives of the northern clubs met in [[Huddersfield]] to form the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Rugby Football Union]] (NRFU). The new body initially permitted only various types of player wage replacements. However, within two years, NRFU players could be paid, but they were required to have a job outside sport.\n\nThe demands of a professional league dictated that rugby had to become a better \"spectator\" sport. Within a few years the NRFU rules had started to diverge from the RFU, most notably with the abolition of the ''[[line-out (rugby union)|line-out]]''. This was followed by the replacement of the ''[[Playing rugby union#Ruck|ruck]]'' with the \"play-the-ball ruck\", which allowed a two-player ruck contest between the tackler at marker and the player tackled. ''[[Rugby union gameplay#Maul|Mauls]]'' were stopped once the ball carrier was held, being replaced by a play-the ball-ruck. The separate Lancashire and Yorkshire competitions of the NRFU merged in 1901, forming the Northern Rugby League, the first time the name [[rugby league]] was used officially in England.\n\nOver time, the RFU form of rugby, played by clubs which remained members of national federations affiliated to the IRFB, became known as [[rugby union]].\n\n=== Globalisation of association football ===\n{{Main|History of FIFA}}\nThe need for a single body to oversee association football had become apparent by the beginning of the 20th century, with the increasing popularity of international fixtures. The English Football Association had chaired many discussions on setting up an international body, but was perceived as making no progress. It fell to associations from seven other European countries: France, Belgium, Denmark, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland, to form an international association. The ''F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association'' ([[FIFA]]) was founded in Paris on 21 May 1904.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/who-we-are/history/index.html|title=History of FIFA - Foundation|last=FIFA.com|publisher=FIFA|access-date=7 November 2019}}</ref> Its first president was [[Robert Gu\u00e9rin]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/who-we-are/history/index.html|title=History of FIFA - Foundation|last=FIFA.com|publisher=FIFA|access-date=7 November 2019}}</ref> The French name and acronym has remained, even outside French-speaking countries.\n\n=== Further divergence of the two rugby codes ===\nRugby league rules diverged significantly from rugby union in 1906, with the reduction of the team from 15 to 13 players. In 1907, a New Zealand professional rugby team toured Australia and Britain, receiving an enthusiastic response, and professional [[rugby league in Australia|rugby leagues were launched in Australia]] the following year. However, the rules of professional games varied from one country to another, and negotiations between various national bodies were required to fix the exact rules for each international match. This situation endured until 1948, when at the instigation of the French league, the [[Rugby League International Federation]] (RLIF) was formed at a meeting in [[Bordeaux]].\n\nDuring the second half of the 20th century, the rules changed further. In 1966, rugby league officials borrowed the American football concept of ''[[Down (football)|downs]]'': a team was allowed to retain possession of the ball for four tackles (rugby union retains the original rule that a player who is tackled and brought to the ground must release the ball immediately).  The maximum number of tackles was later increased to six (in 1971), and in rugby league this became known as the [[Playing rugby league#Six tackle rule|''six tackle rule'']].\n\nWith the advent of full-time professionals in the early 1990s, and the consequent speeding up of the game, the five metre off-side distance between the two teams became 10&nbsp;metres, and the replacement rule was superseded by various interchange rules, among other changes.\n\nThe laws of rugby union also changed during the 20th century, although less significantly than those of rugby league. In particular, goals from ''[[mark (rugby)|marks]]'' were abolished, kicks directly ''[[Touch (rugby)|into touch]]'' from outside the ''[[Rugby pitch|22 metre]]'' line were penalised, new laws were put in place to determine who had possession following an inconclusive ''[[Ruck (Rugby union)|ruck]]'' or ''[[Rugby union gameplay#Maul|maul]]'', and the lifting of players in ''[[line-out (rugby union)|line-out]]s'' was legalised.\n\nIn 1995, rugby union became an \"open\" game, that is one which allowed professional players.<ref>{{cite web |title=History of the RFU |url=http://www.rfu.com/AboutTheRFU/History.aspx |publisher=[[Rugby Football Union]] |accessdate=28 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100422210444/http://www.rfu.com/AboutTheRFU/History.aspx |archivedate=22 April 2010}}</ref> Although the original dispute between the two codes has now disappeared \u2013 and despite the fact that officials from both forms of rugby football have sometimes mentioned the possibility of re-unification \u2013 the rules of both codes and their culture have diverged to such an extent that such an event is unlikely in the foreseeable future.\n\n== Use of the word \"football\" ==\n{{details|Football (word)}}\nThe word ''football'', when used in reference to a specific game can mean any one of those described above. Because of this, much friendly controversy has occurred over the term ''football'', primarily because it is used in different ways in different parts of the [[English-speaking world]]. Most often, the word \"football\" is used to refer to the code of football that is considered dominant within a particular region. So, effectively, what the word \"football\" means usually depends on where one says it.\n[[File:The Sportsman 1910-11-25 Football.png|thumb|Heading from The Sportsman (London) front page of 25 November 1910, illustrating the continued use of the word \"football\" to encompass both association football and rugby]]\nIn each of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada, one football code is known solely as \"football\", while the others generally require a qualifier.
