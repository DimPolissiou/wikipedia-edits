His writings examine free will, consciousness, [[intelligence]] and happiness.\n\nHarari writes about the \"[[Behavioral modernity|cognitive revolution]]\" occurring roughly 70,000 years ago when ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' supplanted the rival [[Neanderthals]], developed language skills and structured societies, and ascended as [[apex predator]]s, aided by the [[First Agricultural Revolution|agricultural revolution]] and accelerated by the [[Scientific revolution|scientific]] method, which have allowed humans to approach near mastery over their environment. His books also examine the possible consequences of a futuristic [[Biotechnology|biotechnological]] world in which intelligent biological organisms are surpassed by their own creations; he has said

This created the Alexandrian Era whose first day was the first day of the [[proleptic calendar|proleptic]] Alexandrian civil year in progress, 29 August 5493 BC. This year was eleven Paschal cycles of 532 years each before the Alexandrian year beginning 29 August 360, which itself was four [[Metonic cycle|19-year cycles]] after the [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]] of the Diocletian Era on 29 August 284.

These movements were nationalist and revolutionary not Islamic but their view that terrorism could be effective in reaching their political goals generated the first phase of modern international terrorism. In the late 1960s, Palestinian secular movements such as [[Fatah|Al Fatah]] and the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (PFLP) began to target civilians outside the immediate arena of conflict. Following Israel's [[Six-Day War|1967 defeat of Arab forces]], Palestinian leaders began to see that the [[Arab world]] was unable to militarily confront Israel. During the same time, lessons drawn from [[revolutionary movement]]s in Latin America, North Africa, Southeast Asia as well as during the Jewish struggle against Britain in Palestine, saw the Palestinians turn away from [[guerrilla warfare]] towards urban terrorism. These movements were secular in nature but their international organization served to spread terrorist tactics worldwide.<ref name=\":4\" />\n \nReligiously motivated groups grew after the failure of Arab nationalism in the [[Six-Day War]] against Israel.

Islamists often identify what they see as a historical struggle between [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], dating back as far as the [[Crusades]], among other historical conflicts between practitioners of the two respective religions. [[Osama bin Laden]], for example, almost invariably described his enemies as aggressive and his call for action against them as defensive. [[Defensive jihad]] differs from offensive jihad by being \"[[fard]] al-ayn\", or a personal obligation of all Muslims, rather than \"fard al-kifaya\", a communal obligation, that is, some Muslims may perform it but it is not required of others. Hence, framing a fight as defensive has the advantage of both appearing to be a victim rather than appearing to be an aggressor, and giving the struggle the very highest religious priority for all good Muslims.\n\nMany of the violent terrorist groups use the name of jihad to fight against certain Western nations and [[Israel]]. An example is bin Laden's al-Qaeda, which is also known as \"International Islamic Front for Jihad Against the Jews and Crusaders\". Most militant Islamists oppose Israel's policies, and they often oppose its very existence.\n\nAccording to [[U.S. Army]] Colonel Dale C. Eikmeier, \"ideology\", rather than any individual or group, is the \"center of gravity\" of al-Qaeda and related groups, and that ideology is a \"collection of violent Islamic thought called [[Qutbism]]\".<ref name=\"eikmeier\"/> He summarizes the tenets of Qutbism as being:\n* A belief that Muslims have deviated from true Islam and must return to \"pure Islam\" as originally practiced during the time of [[Muhammad]].\n* The path to \"pure Islam\" is only through a literal and strict interpretation of the [[Quran]] and [[Hadith]], along with implementation of Muhammad's commands.\n* Muslims should interpret the original sources individually without being bound to follow the interpretations of Islamic scholars.\n* That any interpretation of the Quran from a historical, contextual perspective is a corruption, and that the majority of Islamic history and the [[Fiqh|classical jurisprudential tradition]] is mere sophistry.<ref name=\"eikmeier\"/>\n\nThe historic rivalry between [[Hinduism|Hindus]] and Muslims in the [[South Asia|Indian subcontinent]] has also often been the primary motive behind some of the most deadly terrorist attacks in India. According to a [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] report, India topped the list of countries most affected by Islamic terrorism.\n\nIn addition, Islamist militants, scholars, and leaders opposed Western society for what they see as [[Morality|immoral]] [[secularism]]. Islamists have claimed that such unrestricted free speech has led to the proliferation of [[pornography]], [[immorality]], [[secularism]], [[homosexuality]], [[feminism]], and many other ideas that Islamists often oppose. Although bin Laden almost always emphasized the alleged oppression of Muslims by America and Jews when talking about the need for jihad in his messages, in his \"Letter to America\", he answered the question, \"What are we calling you to, and what do we want from you?\" with\n\n<blockquote>We call you to be a people of manners, principles, honour, and purity; to reject the immoral acts of fornication, homosexuality, intoxicants, gambling's, and trading with interest (...) You separate religion from your policies, (...) You are the nation that permits Usury, which has been forbidden by all the religions (...) You are a nation that permits the production, trading and usage of intoxicants (...) You are a nation that permits acts of immorality (...) You are a nation that permits gambling in its all forms. (...) You use women to serve passengers, visitors, and strangers to increase your profit margins. You then rant that you support the liberation of women.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/nov/24/theobserver Full text: bin Laden's 'letter to America'] accessed 24 May 2007</ref></blockquote>\n\nGiven their perceived [[piety]], ''[[The Times]]'' noted the irony when an investigation discovered that Jihadists were seeking anonymity through some of the same networks used to distribute [[child pornography]].

The bombers, and their sympathizers often believe that suicide bombers, as martyrs ([[Shahid|shaheed]]) to the cause of jihad against the enemy, will receive the rewards of [[Jannah|paradise]] for their actions.\n\n===Hijackings===\nIslamic terrorism sometimes employs the hijacking of passenger vehicles. The most infamous were the [[September 11 attacks|\"9/11\"]] attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people on a single day in 2001, effectively ending the era of [[aircraft hijacking]].\n\n===Kidnappings and executions===\n{{Main|Beheading in Islamism}}\n{{see also|Beheading video|ISIL beheading incidents}}\n\nAlong with bombings and hijackings, Islamic terrorists have made extensive use of highly publicised kidnappings and executions, often circulating videos of the acts for use as propaganda. A frequent form of execution by these groups is [[decapitation]], another is shooting. In the 1980s, a series of abductions of American citizens by Hezbollah during the [[Lebanese Civil War]] resulted in the 1986 [[Iran\u2013Contra affair]]. During the chaos of the [[Iraq War]], more than 200 kidnappings [[Foreign hostages in Iraq|foreign hostages]] (for various reasons and by various groups, including purely criminal) gained great international notoriety, even as the great majority (thousands) of victims were Iraqis. In 2007, the [[kidnapping of Alan Johnston]] by [[Army of Islam (Gaza Strip)|Army of Islam]] resulted in the British government meeting a Hamas member for the first time.\n\n[[Islamism|Islamist]] militants, including [[Boko Haram]], [[Hamas]], [[al-Qaeda]] and the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]], have used [[kidnapping]] as a method of fundraising, as a means of bargaining for political concessions, and as a way of intimidating potential opponents.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Shay|first1=Shaul|title=Global Jihad and the Tactic of Terror Abduction: A Comprehensive Review of Islamic Terrorist Organizations|date=December 2013|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1845196110}}</ref>\n\n[[Michael Rubin]] argued in 2005 that hostage-taking became popular among terrorist groups as a tactic that can hold the attention of a public that had become inured to mass death techniques such as [[suicide bombing]], and that it can garner significant \"political and diplomatic\" payoff. Rubin writes that Islamist kidnappers have the additional, \"ideological goals\" of using hostages both to \"shock the outside world\" and to \"appeal to their own constituency\", and that the public humiliation of hostages is a specific Islamist goal. He also deems hostage taking as an effective technique for cowing a population by making governments appear weak and by inspiring fear of opposing the Islamists.

France is seen as the spearhead directed against jihadist groups in Africa, just as the United States is seen as the main force opposing jihadist groups elsewhere. France's former foreign policies such as that as its colonization of Muslim countries is also brought up in jihadist propaganda, for example that the influence of French education, culture and political institutions had served to erase the Muslim identity of those colonies and their inhabitants.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Bindner|first=Laurence|date=2018|title=Jihadists' Grievance Narratives against France|url=https://icct.nl/publication/jihadists-grievance-narratives-against-france/|journal=Terrorism and Counter-Terrorism Studies|volume=|pages=4\u20138|doi=10.19165/2018.2.01|via=|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n* France's secular domestic policies (''[[La\u00efcit\u00e9]]'') which jihadists perceive to be hostile towards Islam.

For instance, [[Marianne]], the national emblem of France, is considered a \"a false idol\" by jihadists and the French to be \"idol worshippers\". France also has no law against blasphemy and an [[Anti-clericalism|anticlerical]] satirical press which is less respectful towards religion than that of the US or the United Kingdom.

In the [[Moscow theater hostage crisis]] in October 2002, three Chechen separatist groups took an estimated 850 people hostage in the Russian capital; at least 129 hostages died during the storming by Russian special forces, all but one killed by the chemicals used to subdue the attackers (whether this attack would more properly be called a [[nationalism|nationalist]] rather than an Islamist attack is in question).

These movements were nationalist and revolutionary not Islamic but their view that terrorism could be effective in reaching their political goals generated the first phase of modern international terrorism. In the late 1960s, Palestinian secular movements such as [[Fatah|Al Fatah]] and the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (PFLP) began to target civilians outside the immediate arena of conflict. Following Israel's [[Six-Day War|1967 defeat of Arab forces]], Palestinian leaders began to see that the [[Arab world]] was unable to militarily confront Israel. During the same time, lessons drawn from [[revolutionary movement]]s in Latin America, North Africa, Southeast Asia as well as during the Jewish struggle against Britain in Palestine, saw the Palestinians turn away from [[guerrilla warfare]] towards urban terrorism. These movements were secular in nature but their international organization served to spread terrorist tactics worldwide.<ref name=\":4\" />\n \nReligiously motivated groups grew after the failure of Arab nationalism in the [[Six-Day War]] against Israel.

Since their beginning in 1994, the Pakistani-supported [[Taliban]] militia in Afghanistan has gained several characteristics traditionally associated with [[state sponsors of terrorism|state-sponsors of terrorism]], providing logistical support, travel documentation, and training facilities. Since 1989 the increasing willingness of religious extremists to strike targets outside immediate country or regional areas highlights the global nature of contemporary terrorism.

Islamists often identify what they see as a historical struggle between [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], dating back as far as the [[Crusades]], among other historical conflicts between practitioners of the two respective religions. [[Osama bin Laden]], for example, almost invariably described his enemies as aggressive and his call for action against them as defensive. [[Defensive jihad]] differs from offensive jihad by being \"[[fard]] al-ayn\", or a personal obligation of all Muslims, rather than \"fard al-kifaya\", a communal obligation, that is, some Muslims may perform it but it is not required of others. Hence, framing a fight as defensive has the advantage of both appearing to be a victim rather than appearing to be an aggressor, and giving the struggle the very highest religious priority for all good Muslims.\n\nMany of the violent terrorist groups use the name of jihad to fight against certain Western nations and [[Israel]]. An example is bin Laden's al-Qaeda, which is also known as \"International Islamic Front for Jihad Against the Jews and Crusaders\". Most militant Islamists oppose Israel's policies, and they often oppose its very existence.\n\nAccording to [[U.S. Army]] Colonel Dale C. Eikmeier, \"ideology\", rather than any individual or group, is the \"center of gravity\" of al-Qaeda and related groups, and that ideology is a \"collection of violent Islamic thought called [[Qutbism]]\".<ref name=\"eikmeier\"/> He summarizes the tenets of Qutbism as being:\n* A belief that Muslims have deviated from true Islam and must return to \"pure Islam\" as originally practiced during the time of [[Muhammad]].\n* The path to \"pure Islam\" is only through a literal and strict interpretation of the [[Quran]] and [[Hadith]], along with implementation of Muhammad's commands.\n* Muslims should interpret the original sources individually without being bound to follow the interpretations of Islamic scholars.\n* That any interpretation of the Quran from a historical, contextual perspective is a corruption, and that the majority of Islamic history and the [[Fiqh|classical jurisprudential tradition]] is mere sophistry.<ref name=\"eikmeier\"/>\n\nThe historic rivalry between [[Hinduism|Hindus]] and Muslims in the [[South Asia|Indian subcontinent]] has also often been the primary motive behind some of the most deadly terrorist attacks in India. According to a [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] report, India topped the list of countries most affected by Islamic terrorism.\n\nIn addition, Islamist militants, scholars, and leaders opposed Western society for what they see as [[Morality|immoral]] [[secularism]]. Islamists have claimed that such unrestricted free speech has led to the proliferation of [[pornography]], [[immorality]], [[secularism]], [[homosexuality]], [[feminism]], and many other ideas that Islamists often oppose. Although bin Laden almost always emphasized the alleged oppression of Muslims by America and Jews when talking about the need for jihad in his messages, in his \"Letter to America\", he answered the question, \"What are we calling you to, and what do we want from you?\" with\n\n<blockquote>We call you to be a people of manners, principles, honour, and purity; to reject the immoral acts of fornication, homosexuality, intoxicants, gambling's, and trading with interest (...) You separate religion from your policies, (...) You are the nation that permits Usury, which has been forbidden by all the religions (...) You are a nation that permits the production, trading and usage of intoxicants (...) You are a nation that permits acts of immorality (...) You are a nation that permits gambling in its all forms.

Wide majorities say such attacks are, at most, rarely acceptable. The shift of attitudes against terror has been especially dramatic in Jordan, where 29% of Jordanians were recorded as viewing suicide-attacks as often or sometimes justified (down from 57% in May 2005). In the largest majority-Muslim nation, Indonesia, 74% of respondents agree that terrorist attacks are \"never justified\" (a substantial increase from the 41% level to which support had risen in March 2004); in Pakistan, that figure is 86%; in Bangladesh, 81%; and in Iran, 80%.<ref name=\"australia.to\"/>\n* A poll conducted in Osama bin Laden's home country of Saudi Arabia in December 2008 shows that his compatriots have dramatically turned against him, his organisation, Saudi volunteers in Iraq, and terrorism in general.

The bombers, and their sympathizers often believe that suicide bombers, as martyrs ([[Shahid|shaheed]]) to the cause of jihad against the enemy, will receive the rewards of [[Jannah|paradise]] for their actions.\n\n===Hijackings===\nIslamic terrorism sometimes employs the hijacking of passenger vehicles. The most infamous were the [[September 11 attacks|\"9/11\"]] attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people on a single day in 2001, effectively ending the era of [[aircraft hijacking]].\n\n===Kidnappings and executions===\n{{Main|Beheading in Islamism}}\n{{see also|Beheading video|ISIL beheading incidents}}\n\nAlong with bombings and hijackings, Islamic terrorists have made extensive use of highly publicised kidnappings and executions, often circulating videos of the acts for use as propaganda. A frequent form of execution by these groups is [[decapitation]], another is shooting. In the 1980s, a series of abductions of American citizens by Hezbollah during the [[Lebanese Civil War]] resulted in the 1986 [[Iran\u2013Contra affair]]. During the chaos of the [[Iraq War]], more than 200 kidnappings [[Foreign hostages in Iraq|foreign hostages]] (for various reasons and by various groups, including purely criminal) gained great international notoriety, even as the great majority (thousands) of victims were Iraqis. In 2007, the [[kidnapping of Alan Johnston]] by [[Army of Islam (Gaza Strip)|Army of Islam]] resulted in the British government meeting a Hamas member for the first time.\n\n[[Islamism|Islamist]] militants, including [[Boko Haram]], [[Hamas]], [[al-Qaeda]] and the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]], have used [[kidnapping]] as a method of fundraising, as a means of bargaining for political concessions, and as a way of intimidating potential opponents.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Shay|first1=Shaul|title=Global Jihad and the Tactic of Terror Abduction: A Comprehensive Review of Islamic Terrorist Organizations|date=December 2013|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1845196110}}</ref>\n\n[[Michael Rubin]] argued in 2005 that hostage-taking became popular among terrorist groups as a tactic that can hold the attention of a public that had become inured to mass death techniques such as [[suicide bombing]], and that it can garner significant \"political and diplomatic\" payoff.

The three main reasons France is attacked are, in no particular order:<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n* France's foreign policy towards Muslim countries and jihadist fronts. France is seen as the spearhead directed against jihadist groups in Africa, just as the United States is seen as the main force opposing jihadist groups elsewhere. France's former foreign policies such as that as its colonization of Muslim countries is also brought up in jihadist propaganda, for example that the influence of French education, culture and political institutions had served to erase the Muslim identity of those colonies and their inhabitants.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Bindner|first=Laurence|date=2018|title=Jihadists' Grievance Narratives against France|url=https://icct.nl/publication/jihadists-grievance-narratives-against-france/|journal=Terrorism and Counter-Terrorism Studies|volume=|pages=4\u20138|doi=10.19165/2018.2.01|via=|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n* France's secular domestic policies (''[[La\u00efcit\u00e9]]'') which jihadists perceive to be hostile towards Islam.

For instance, [[Marianne]], the national emblem of France, is considered a \"a false idol\" by jihadists and the French to be \"idol worshippers\". France also has no law against blasphemy and an [[Anti-clericalism|anticlerical]] satirical press which is less respectful towards religion than that of the US or the United Kingdom.
