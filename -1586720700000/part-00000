A theorem states that ''n'' is prime if and only if all such functions ''p''<sub>''n''</sub> are algebra endomorphisms.\n\nIn-between these two conditions lies the definition of '''Carmichael number of order m''' for any positive integer ''m'' as any composite number ''n'' such that ''p''<sub>''n''</sub> is an endomorphism on every '''Z'''<sub>''n''</sub>-algebra that can be generated as '''Z'''<sub>''n''</sub>-[[module (mathematics)|module]] by ''m'' elements. Carmichael numbers of order 1 are just the ordinary Carmichael numbers.\n\n===An order 2 Carmichael number===\nAccording to Howe, 17 \u00b7 31 \u00b7 41 \u00b7 43 \u00b7 89 \u00b7 97 \u00b7 167 \u00b7 331 is an order 2 Carmichael number.

(The oddness of Carmichael numbers also follows from the fact that <math>-1</math> is a [[Fermat primality test|Fermat witness]] for any even composite number.)\nFrom the criterion it also follows that Carmichael numbers are [[Cyclic number (group theory)|cyclic]].<ref>[http://www.numericana.com/data/crump.htm Carmichael Multiples of Odd Cyclic Numbers] \"Any divisor of a Carmichael number must be an odd cyclic number\"</ref><ref>Proof sketch: If <math>n</math> is square-free but not cyclic, <math>p_i \\mid p_j - 1</math> for two prime factors <math>p_i</math> and <math>p_j</math> of <math>n</math>.

For any nonzero prime ideal <math>\\mathfrak p</math> in <math>{\\mathcal O}_K</math>, we have <math>\\alpha^{{\\rm N}(\\mathfrak p)} \\equiv \\alpha \\bmod {\\mathfrak p}</math> for all <math>\\alpha</math> in <math>{\\mathcal O}_K</math>, where <math>{\\rm N}(\\mathfrak p)</math> is the norm of the ideal <math>\\mathfrak p</math>. (This generalizes Fermat's little theorem, that <math>m^p \\equiv m \\bmod p</math> for all integers ''m'' when ''p'' is prime.) Call a nonzero ideal <math>\\mathfrak a</math> in <math>{\\mathcal O}_K</math> Carmichael if it is not a prime ideal and <math>\\alpha^{{\\rm N}(\\mathfrak a)} \\equiv \\alpha \\bmod {\\mathfrak a}</math> for all <math>\\alpha \\in {\\mathcal O}_K</math>, where <math>{\\rm N}(\\mathfrak a)</math> is the norm of the ideal <math>\\mathfrak a</math>.  When ''K'' is <math>\\mathbf Q</math>, the ideal <math>\\mathfrak a</math> is principal, and if we let ''a'' be its positive generator then the ideal <math>\\mathfrak a = (a)</math> is Carmichael exactly when ''a'' is a Carmichael number in the usual sense.\n\nWhen ''K'' is larger than the rationals it is easy to write down Carmichael ideals in <math>{\\mathcal O}_K</math>: for any prime number ''p'' that splits completely in ''K'', the principal ideal <math>p{\\mathcal O}_K</math> is a Carmichael ideal. Since infinitely many prime numbers split completely in any number field, there are infinitely many Carmichael ideals in <math>{\\mathcal O}_K</math>. For example, if ''p'' is any prime number that is 1 mod 4, the ideal (''p'') in the Gaussian integers '''Z'''[''i''] is a Carmichael ideal.\n\nBoth prime and Carmichael numbers satisfy the following equality:\n:<math>\\gcd \\left(\\sum_{x=1}^{n-1} x^{n-1}, n\\right)=1</math>\n\n==Lucas\u2013Carmichael number==\n\n{{main|Lucas\u2013Carmichael number}}\n\nA positive composite integer <math>n</math> is a Lucas\u2013Carmichael number if and only if <math>n</math> is [[square-free integer|square-free]], and for all [[prime divisor]]s <math>p</math> of <math>n</math>, it is true that <math>p + 1 \\mid n + 1</math>.

The first Quasi\u2013Carmichael numbers are:\n\n: 35, 77, 143, 165, 187, 209, 221, 231, 247, 273, 299, 323, 357, 391, 399, 437, 493, 527, 561, 589, 598, 713, 715, 899, 935, 943, 989, 1015, 1073, 1105, 1147, 1189, 1247, 1271, 1295, 1333, 1517, 1537, 1547, 1591, 1595, 1705, 1729, ... {{OEIS|A257750}}\n\n== Kn\u00f6del number==\n\n{{main|Kn\u00f6del number}}\n\nAn ''n''-'''Kn\u00f6del number''' for a given [[positive integer]] ''n'' is a [[composite number]] ''m'' with the property that each ''i''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''m'' [[coprime]] to ''m'' satisfies <math>i^{m - n} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{m}</math>. The ''n'' = 1 case are Carmichael numbers.\n\n==Higher-order Carmichael numbers==\nCarmichael numbers can be generalized using concepts of [[abstract algebra]].\n\nThe above definition states that a composite integer ''n'' is Carmichael\nprecisely when the ''n''th-power-raising function ''p''<sub>''n''</sub> from the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] '''Z'''<sub>''n''</sub> of integers modulo ''n'' to itself is the identity function. The identity is the only '''Z'''<sub>''n''</sub>-[[algebra over a field|algebra]] [[endomorphism]] on '''Z'''<sub>''n''</sub> so we can restate the definition as asking that ''p''<sub>''n''</sub> be an algebra endomorphism of '''Z'''<sub>''n''</sub>.\nAs above, ''p''<sub>''n''</sub> satisfies the same property whenever ''n'' is prime.\n\nThe ''n''th-power-raising function ''p''<sub>''n''</sub> is also defined on any '''Z'''<sub>''n''</sub>-algebra '''A'''. A theorem states that ''n'' is prime if and only if all such functions ''p''<sub>''n''</sub> are algebra endomorphisms.\n\nIn-between these two conditions lies the definition of '''Carmichael number of order m''' for any positive integer ''m'' as any composite number ''n'' such that ''p''<sub>''n''</sub> is an endomorphism on every '''Z'''<sub>''n''</sub>-algebra that can be generated as '''Z'''<sub>''n''</sub>-[[module (mathematics)|module]] by ''m'' elements. Carmichael numbers of order 1 are just the ordinary Carmichael numbers.\n\n===An order 2 Carmichael number===\nAccording to Howe, 17 \u00b7 31 \u00b7 41 \u00b7 43 \u00b7 89 \u00b7 97 \u00b7 167 \u00b7 331 is an order 2 Carmichael number.

Platts played a single first-class game for MCC against [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]] in June 1870 which resulted in tragedy. He was fast bowling on a badly laid wicket at [[Lord's]] when the ball struck the batsman [[George Summers (cricketer)|George Summers]] on the head. Summers retired hurt and appeared to recover, but died four days later. [[W. G. Grace]] was also playing for MCC in the match and commented on the incident \"...the bowler was not in the least to blame for the catastrophe, but he was terribly cut up, and I shall never forget his mental distraction.\"<ref name=\"Bygone\"/> Platts later turned out against All England XI's, first for Lichfield when he took 10 wickets in the match, and then for Wirksworth where he was upstaged by another future Derbyshire player [[Dove Gregory]].\n\nAfter [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club]] was established, Platts played in the club's first match in the [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1871|1871 season]] against [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]] in May, and for thirteen years thereafter. Although undistinguished in the first game, he came in to bowl in the second match that season and took 5 for 34. During the [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1872|1872 season]] he took 5\u201351 in the first innings of the second match against Lancashire. He took four wickets in the [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1873|1873 season]], while his batting scores improved significantly in the [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1874|1874 season]]. All through these early years Platt appeared in matches involving All England XIs and United South of England XIs sometimes for them and sometimes against them. He was usually against the side in which W. G. Grace was playing. At Birmingham in 1874 he was bowled by Grace, but in 1876, turning out for an assortment of clubs including Swansea, Barrow, Birmingham and Stockport, he took Grace's wicket twice. For [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1876|Derbyshire in the 1876 season]] he was top scorer with 235. His first-class bowling took a step forward and he took 6\u201368 for Derbyshire against [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent]]. In the [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1877|1877 season]] he made his top score of 115 against [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]], which was the club's first century, and topped the scoring for Derbyshire again with 432. He took 5\u201318 against Lancashire that year. He continued playing other matches for and against other clubs, although this tailed out in the early 1880s. By 1881 he was running the \"Rose and Crown\" public house at Chellaston as well as being a professional cricketer.<ref>British Census 1881 RG11 3387/48 p16</ref>\n\nIn the [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1880|1880 season]] he took 5\u201326 against [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]], in the [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1881|1881 season]] 6\u201339 against Lancashire and in the [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1882|1882 season]] 5\u201348 against Lancashire. Platts played against a line-up of Australians several times during the early part of the decade, fixtures intended to help the young members of the international side do their homework for possible upcoming Test fixtures against [[England national cricket team|England]]. After the final one of these in which he participated, Platts played one final game, and, having continued steadily up the order during his career, played his penultimate game in the [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1884|1884 season]] as an opener.<ref>[https://cricketarchive.com/Players/32/32094/32094.html John Platts at Cricket Archive]</ref>\n\nPlatts was a left-handed batsman and a right-arm round-arm slow bowler, with the added bonus of some occasionally fiendish pace to his straight-arm action.\n\nPlatts started umpiring in 1885 immediately after he stopped playing and took 69 first-class games until 1896.\n\nLater, John Platts was diagnosed with tuberculosis and died at his home in August 1898, at the age of 49.<ref name=\"Bygone\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Platts, John}}\n[[Category:1848 births]]\n[[Category:1898 deaths]]\n[[Category:English cricketers]]\n[[Category:Derbyshire cricketers]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Derby]]\n[[Category:Marylebone Cricket Club cricketers]]\n[[Category:North v South cricketers]]\n[[Category:Non-international England cricketers]]\n[[Category:People from Chellaston]]\n[[Category:Players of the North cricketers]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|English cricketer}}\n{{for2|the reference book writer|[[John Platts (Unitarian)]]|the British scholar of languages|[[John Thompson Platts]]}}\n{{EngvarB|date=August 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2013}}\n{{Infobox cricketer\n|          name = John Platts\n|            fullname = John Thomas Brown Dumelow Platts\n|          birth_date = {{Birth date|1848|11|23|df=yes}}\n|        birth_place = [[Chellaston]], Derbyshire, England\n|          death_date = {{Death date and age|1898|8|6|1848|11|23|df=yes}}\n|        death_place = [[Derby]], Derbyshire, England\n|             batting = Left-handed\n|             bowling = Right arm [[Fast bowling|fast]], later [[Fast bowling#Categorisation of fast bowling|slow]]\n| club1 = [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC)\n| year1 = 1870\n|               club2 = [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club|Derbyshire]]\n|               year2 = [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1871|1871]]\u2013[[Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1884|1884]]\n| type1 = [[First-class cricket|First-class]]\n| debutdate1 = 13 June\n| debutyear1 = 1870\n| debutfor1 = MCC\n| debutagainst1 = [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]]\n| lastdate1 = 4 August\n| lastyear1 = 1884\n| lastfor1 = [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club|Derbyshire]]\n| lastagainst1 = [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]]\n|             columns = 1\n|             column1 = [[First-class cricket|First-class]]\n|            matches1 = 97\n|               runs1 = 2,237\n|            bat avg1 = 12.85\n|           100s/50s1 = 1/5\n|          top score1 = 115\n|         deliveries1 = 8,671\n|            wickets1 = 195\n|           bowl avg1 = 18.83\n|            fivefor1 = 7\n|             tenfor1 = 0\n|       best bowling1 = 6/39\n|  catches/stumpings1 = 56/\u2013\n|                date = 18 July\n|                year = 2010\n|              source = https://cricketarchive.com/Players/32/32094/32094.html CricketArchive\n}}\n'''John Thomas Brown Dumelow Platts''' (23 November 1848 \u2013 6 August 1898) was an English [[cricket]]er who played for [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club|Derbyshire]] between 1871 and 1884.

He was fast bowling on a badly laid wicket at [[Lord's]] when the ball struck the batsman [[George Summers (cricketer)|George Summers]] on the head. Summers retired hurt and appeared to recover, but died four days later. [[W. G. Grace]] was also playing for MCC in the match and commented on the incident \"...the bowler was not in the least to blame for the catastrophe, but he was terribly cut up, and I shall never forget his mental distraction.\"<ref name=\"Bygone\"/> Platts later turned out against All England XI's, first for Lichfield when he took 10 wickets in the match, and then for Wirksworth where he was upstaged by another future Derbyshire player [[Dove Gregory]].\n\nAfter [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club]] was established, Platts played in the club's first match in the [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1871|1871 season]] against [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]] in May, and for thirteen years thereafter. Although undistinguished in the first game, he came in to bowl in the second match that season and took 5 for 34. During the [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1872|1872 season]] he took 5\u201351 in the first innings of the second match against Lancashire. He took four wickets in the [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1873|1873 season]], while his batting scores improved significantly in the [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1874|1874 season]]. All through these early years Platt appeared in matches involving All England XIs and United South of England XIs sometimes for them and sometimes against them. He was usually against the side in which W. G. Grace was playing. At Birmingham in 1874 he was bowled by Grace, but in 1876, turning out for an assortment of clubs including Swansea, Barrow, Birmingham and Stockport, he took Grace's wicket twice. For [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1876|Derbyshire in the 1876 season]] he was top scorer with 235. His first-class bowling took a step forward and he took 6\u201368 for Derbyshire against [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent]]. In the [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1877|1877 season]] he made his top score of 115 against [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]], which was the club's first century, and topped the scoring for Derbyshire again with 432. He took 5\u201318 against Lancashire that year. He continued playing other matches for and against other clubs, although this tailed out in the early 1880s. By 1881 he was running the \"Rose and Crown\" public house at Chellaston as well as being a professional cricketer.<ref>British Census 1881 RG11 3387/48 p16</ref>\n\nIn the [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1880|1880 season]] he took 5\u201326 against [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]], in the [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1881|1881 season]] 6\u201339 against Lancashire and in the [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1882|1882 season]] 5\u201348 against Lancashire. Platts played against a line-up of Australians several times during the early part of the decade, fixtures intended to help the young members of the international side do their homework for possible upcoming Test fixtures against [[England national cricket team|England]]. After the final one of these in which he participated, Platts played one final game, and, having continued steadily up the order during his career, played his penultimate game in the [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1884|1884 season]] as an opener.<ref>[https://cricketarchive.com/Players/32/32094/32094.html John Platts at Cricket Archive]</ref>\n\nPlatts was a left-handed batsman and a right-arm round-arm slow bowler, with the added bonus of some occasionally fiendish pace to his straight-arm action.\n\nPlatts started umpiring in 1885 immediately after he stopped playing and took 69 first-class games until 1896.\n\nLater, John Platts was diagnosed with tuberculosis and died at his home in August 1898, at the age of 49.<ref name=\"Bygone\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Platts, John}}\n[[Category:1848 births]]\n[[Category:1898 deaths]]\n[[Category:English cricketers]]\n[[Category:Derbyshire cricketers]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Derby]]\n[[Category:Marylebone Cricket Club cricketers]]\n[[Category:North v South cricketers]]\n[[Category:Non-international England cricketers]]\n[[Category:People from Chellaston]]\n[[Category:Players of the North cricketers]]\n", "name_user": "Nihiltres", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:Simplified hatnote syntax", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Platts"}

The 130 [[First class travel|First Class]] [[Cabin (ship)|cabins]] had access to lounges, bars, [[smoking room]] and a Tropical [[Verandah]]. For the very wealthy there were two Deluxe Suites with lounge, bedroom, two bathrooms, private deck (Veranda).  She had 18 [[Travel class|Second Class]] 18 cabins. They was for day passenger a [[Tweendeck]] and a [[cafeteria]].\n\n==World war 2==\nWith the outbreak of [[World war 2]] the SS ''Op Ten Noort'' was taken over by the Royal Dutch Navy in December of 1941 as she docked in Jakarta. There she was refit into a hospital ship. She was painted all white ship, with huge red crosses. The Dutch Government officially reported the [[Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] at the [[Swedish embassy]] in [[Tokyo]] of the change to SS ''Op Ten Noort''. She was now an operational hospital ship, as thus would not be part of the war effort, that is would not transport any weapons or active troops. On February 4, 1942 The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and [[Ministry of the Navy (Japan)|Naval Ministry]] acknowledges ''Op Ten Noort'' status change though the Swedish embassy. On February 21, 1941, completed she departed on her first trip to help wounded [[Allies of World War II|allies]]. But only a few hours out of port, the ''Op Ten Noort'' was bombed by the Empire of Japan in the [[Java Sea]]. One surgeon and three nurses were killed, eleven were badly wounded. Dutch Government sent a strong note of protest of the bombing to the Japan, through the Embassy of Sweden. After repairs, on 28 February 1942 she was commandeered by the [[Japanese destroyer Amatsukaze (1939)|Japanese destroyer Amatsukaze]] and [[Japanese destroyer Murasame (1935)|Japanese destroyer Murasame]] near [[Bawean Island]], stopping her rescue work again. Japanese forced her crew to transport their [[POW]]s to [[List of Japanese-run internment camps during World War II|Japan POW camps]]. The first POW move was that of 59 POWs from the [[USS Perch (SS-176)|USS ''Perch'']] that were on the [[Japanese destroyer Ushio (1930)|Japanese destroyer ''Ushi'']]. By the end of March 1942 she had 970 POWs, most from the 800 survivors from [[HMS Exeter (68)|HMS ''Exeter'']] that sank on March 1, 1942. The [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] were kept in very poor conditions and feed only a cup of rice a day, called [[List of Japanese hell ships|Japanese hell ships]].  <ref>[https://www.britain-at-war.org.uk/WW2/Alf_King/html/japanese_pow.htm Japanese POW by Alf King]</ref> On 20 December 1942 she became the HMHS ''Tenno Maru'' an official Japanese Hospital Ship. The Dutch ship crew was taken off the ship and became POWs at Camp Myoshi, near [[Yokohama]]. Japan had signed the [[Hague Convention of 1907|Hague Convention X of 1907]] that stated attacking a hospital ship is a war crime.<ref name=\"hague10\">{{cite web |date= October 18, 1907|url = http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hague10.asp|title = Convention for the adaptation to maritime war of the principles of the Geneva Convention|publisher = [[Yale University]]| accessdate = August 2, 2009 | last= |quote=}}</ref><ref>[https://archive.vn/20130616131847/http://www.minbuza.nl/en/key-topics/treaties/search-the-treaty-database/1899/7/002339.html Convention for the adaptation to maritime warfare of the principles of the Geneva Convention of 22 August 1864]</ref><ref>[http://www.combinedfleet.com/Hikawa2_t.htm combinedfleet.com ''Hikawa Maru No.2''] </ref>\n\nWith the war coming to an end, the ship was changed in October of 1944. A second dummy smokestack was added to \"hide her\". She was renamed the HMHS ''Hikawa Maru No.2''. She both served as a hospital ship and transport war cargo. For the latter part of 1944 and into 1945 she traveled from Singapore and Manila with a cargo of looted gold and other valuable Japanese conquests. The weeks before Japan surrender she arrived in Japan with gold, platinum, diamonds and gems. On August 15, 1945, the Japanese officially announce surrender. To cover up the war crimes and to hide the stolen loot, the ship was sunk on August 17, 1945, at [[Wakasa Bay]] in 400 feet of water. To sink her two 328 pound explosive charges were place in the bottom of the hull.
