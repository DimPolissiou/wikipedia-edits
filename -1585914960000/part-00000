In 1943, a Democratic Federal Yugoslavia was proclaimed by the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan resistance]]. In 1944 King [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter II]], then living in exile, recognised it as the legitimate government. The monarchy was subsequently abolished in November 1945. Yugoslavia was renamed the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia in 1946, when a communist government was established. It acquired the territories of [[Istria]], [[Rijeka]], and [[Zadar]] from Italy. Partisan leader [[Josip Broz Tito]] ruled the country as president until his death in 1980. In 1963, the country was renamed again, as the ''[[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]'' (SFRY).\n\nThe six constituent republics that made up the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFRY]] were the [[Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|SR Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Socialist Republic of Croatia|SR Croatia]], [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia|SR Macedonia]], [[Socialist Republic of Montenegro|SR Montenegro]], [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|SR Serbia]], and [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia|SR Slovenia]].

The name was created by the combination of the Slavic words \"jug\" (south) and \"slaveni\" (Slavs). Yugoslavia was the result of the [[Corfu Declaration]], as a project of the Serbian Parliament in exile and the Serbian royal [[Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasty]], who became the Yugoslav royal dynasty.\n\n==Kingdom of Yugoslavia==\n{{Main|Kingdom of Yugoslavia}}\n{{multiple image\n|align=right\n|direction=vertical\n|width=210\n|header=\n|image1=\n|image2=Banovine Jugoslavia.png|caption2=[[Subdivisions of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Banovinas]] of Yugoslavia, 1929\u201339. After 1939 the Sava and Littoral banovinas were merged into the [[Banovina of Croatia]].\n}}\n\nThe country was formed in 1918 immediately after World War I as the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes by union of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] and the [[Kingdom of Serbia]]. It was commonly referred to at the time as the \"[[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles]] state\". Later, the government renamed the country leading to the first official use of ''Yugoslavia'' in 1929.\n\n===King Alexander===\nOn 20 June 1928, Serb deputy [[Puni\u0161a Ra\u010di\u0107]] shot at five members of the opposition Croatian Peasant Party in the [[Parliament of Yugoslavia|National Assembly]] resulting in the death of two deputies on the spot and that of leader [[Stjepan Radi\u0107]] a few weeks later.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=73}} On 6 January 1929, [[King of Yugoslavia|King]] [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander I]] suspended the constitution, banned national political parties, assumed executive power and renamed the country Yugoslavia.<ref>{{cite web |url =http://www.indiana.edu/~league/1929.htm |title =Chronology 1929 |author =''[[Indiana University]]'' |publisher =indiana.edu |date =October 2002 |access-date =8 February 2014 |archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20150222035557/http://www.indiana.edu/~league/1929.htm |archive-date =22 February 2015 |url-status =live }}</ref> He hoped to curb separatist tendencies and mitigate nationalist passions.

None of these three regimes favored the policy pursued by Alexander I. In fact, Italy and Germany wanted to revise the international treaties signed after World War I, and the Soviets were determined to regain their positions in Europe and pursue a more active international policy.\n\nAlexander attempted to create a centralised Yugoslavia. He decided to abolish Yugoslavia's historic regions, and new internal boundaries were drawn for provinces or banovinas. The banovinas were named after rivers. Many politicians were jailed or kept under police surveillance. The effect of Alexander's dictatorship was to further alienate the non-Serbs from the idea of unity.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xcp7OXQE0FMC&pg=PA624 |title=The Balkans since 1453 |page=624 |isbn=9781850655510 |last1=Stavrianos |first1=Leften Stavros |year=2000 |access-date=17 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016040853/https://books.google.com/books?id=xcp7OXQE0FMC&pg=PA624 |archive-date=16 October 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> During his reign the flags of Yugoslav nations were banned. Communist ideas were banned also.\n\nThe king was assassinated in [[Marseille]] during an official visit to France in 1934 by [[Vlado Chernozemski]], an experienced marksman from [[Ivan Mihailov]]'s [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] with the cooperation of the [[Usta\u0161e]], a Croatian fascist revolutionary organisation. Alexander was succeeded by his eleven-year-old son [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter II]] and a regency council headed by his cousin, [[Prince Paul of Yugoslavia|Prince Paul]].\n\n===1934\u20131941===\nThe international political scene in the late 1930s was marked by growing intolerance between the principal figures, by the aggressive attitude of the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regimes and by the certainty that the order set up after World War I was losing its strongholds and its sponsors were losing their strength. Supported and pressured by [[Italian fascism|Fascist Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany]], Croatian leader [[Vladko Ma\u010dek]] and his party managed the creation of the [[Banovina of Croatia]] (Autonomous Region with significant internal self-government) in 1939. The agreement specified that Croatia was to remain part of Yugoslavia, but it was hurriedly building an independent political identity in international relations. The entire kingdom was to be federalised but World War II stopped the fulfillment of those plans.\n\nPrince Paul submitted to the fascist pressure and signed the [[Tripartite Pact]] in Vienna on 25 March 1941, hoping to still keep Yugoslavia out of the war. But this was at the expense of popular support for Paul's regency. Senior military officers were also opposed to the treaty and launched a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] when the king returned on [[Yugoslav military coup of March 27, 1941|27 March]]. Army General [[Du\u0161an Simovi\u0107]] seized power, arrested the Vienna delegation, exiled Paul, and ended the regency, giving 17-year-old [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|King Peter]] full powers.

The [[Independent State of Croatia]] was established as a [[Nazi]] satellite state, ruled by the fascist militia known as the [[Usta\u0161e]] that came into existence in 1929, but was relatively limited in its activities until 1941. German troops occupied [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] and [[Herzegovina]] as well as part of [[Serbia]] and [[Slovenia]], while other parts of the country were occupied by [[Bulgaria]], Hungary, and Italy. From 1941\u201345, the Croatian [[Usta\u0161e]] regime murdered around 500,000 people, 250,000 were expelled, and another 200,000 were forced to convert to [[Catholicism]].\n\nFrom the start, the Yugoslav resistance forces consisted of two factions: the communist-led [[Yugoslav Partisans]] and the royalist [[Chetniks]], with the former receiving Allied recognition only at the Tehran conference (1943). The heavily pro-Serbian Chetniks were led by [[Dra\u017ea Mihajlovi\u0107]], while the pan-Yugoslav oriented Partisans were led by [[Josip Broz Tito]].\n\nThe Partisans initiated a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] campaign that developed into the largest resistance army in occupied Western and Central Europe. The Chetniks were initially supported by the exiled royal government and the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], but they soon focused increasingly on combating the Partisans rather than the occupying Axis forces. By the end of the war, the Chetnik movement transformed into a collaborationist Serb nationalist militia completely dependent on Axis supplies.<ref>7David Martin, Ally Betrayed: The Uncensored Story of Tito and Mihailovich, (New York: Prentice Hall, 1946), 34.</ref> The highly mobile Partisans, however, carried on their guerrilla warfare with great success. Most notable of the victories against the occupying forces were the battles of [[Battle of Neretva|Neretva]] and [[Battle of Sutjeska|Sutjeska]].\n\nOn 25 November 1942, the [[AVNOJ|Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia]] was convened in [[Biha\u0107]], modern day [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The council reconvened on 29 November 1943, in [[Jajce]], also in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and established the basis for post-war organisation of the country, establishing a federation (this date was celebrated as Republic Day after the war).\n\nThe [[Yugoslav Partisans]] were able to expel the Axis from Serbia in 1944 and the rest of Yugoslavia in 1945. The [[Red Army]] provided limited assistance with the liberation of [[Belgrade]] and withdrew after the war was over. In May 1945, the Partisans met with Allied forces outside former Yugoslav borders, after also taking over [[Trieste]] and parts of the southern Austrian provinces of [[Styria]] and [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]]. However, the Partisans withdrew from Trieste in June of the same year under heavy pressure from Stalin, who did not want a confrontation with the other Allies.\n\nWestern attempts to reunite the Partisans, who denied the supremacy of the old government of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], and the \u00e9migr\u00e9s loyal to the king led to the [[Tito-\u0160uba\u0161i\u0107 Agreement]] in June 1944; however, [[Marshal of Yugoslavia|Marshal]] Josip Broz Tito was in control and was determined to lead an independent communist state, starting as a prime minister.  He had the support of Moscow and London and led by far the strongest partisan force with 800,000 men.<ref>Michael Lees, ''The Rape of Serbia: The British Role in Tito's Grab for Power, 1943\u20131944'' (1990).</ref><ref>{{cite book|author1=James R.

Tito, at first went along and rejected the Marshall plan. However, in 1948 Tito broke decisively with Stalin on other issues, making Yugoslavia an independent communist state. Yugoslavia requested American aid. American leaders were internally divided, but finally agreed and began sending money on a small scale in 1949, and on a much larger scale 1950\u201353. The American aid was not part of the Marshall plan.<ref>{{cite book|author=John R.

In Slovenia the recognized minorities were Hungarians and Italians.\n\n[[Vojvodina]] and [[Kosovo|Kosovo-Metohija]] formed a part of the Republic of [[Serbia]] but those provinces also formed part of the federation, which led to the unique situation that [[Central Serbia]] did not have its own assembly but a joint assembly with its provinces represented in it.\n\n==SFR Yugoslavia==\n[[File:Josip Broz Tito uniform portrait.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|right|Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]]]]\n{{Main|Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia}}\n\nOn 7 April 1963, the nation changed its official name to [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] and Josip Broz Tito was named [[President for life]]. In the SFRY, each republic and province had its own constitution, supreme court, parliament, president and prime minister. At the top of the Yugoslav government were the President (Tito), the federal Prime Minister, and the federal Parliament (a collective Presidency was formed after Tito's death in 1980). Also important were the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia|Communist Party]] general secretaries for each republic and province, and the general secretary of Central Committee of the Communist Party.\n\nTito was the most powerful person in the country, followed by republican and provincial premiers and presidents, and Communist Party presidents. Slobodan Penezi\u0107 Krcun, Tito's chief of secret police in Serbia, fell victim to a dubious traffic incident after he started to complain about Tito's politics. Minister of the interior [[Aleksandar Rankovi\u0107]] lost all of his titles and rights after a major disagreement with Tito regarding state politics. Some influential ministers in government, such as [[Edvard Kardelj]] or [[Stane Dolanc]], were more important than the Prime Minister.\n\nFirst cracks in the tightly governed system surfaced when [[1968 student demonstrations in Belgrade|students in Belgrade and several other cities joined]] the worldwide [[protests of 1968]]. President Josip Broz Tito gradually stopped the protests by giving in to some of the students' demands and saying that \"students are right\" during a televised speech. But in the following years, he dealt with the leaders of the protests by sacking them from university and Communist party posts.<ref>{{cite journal |last=\u017dilnik |first=\u017delimir |url=http://www.ghi-dc.org/files/publications/bu_supp/supp006/bus6_181.pdf |title=Yugoslavia: \"Down with the Red Bourgeoisie!\" |issue=1968: Memories and Legacies of a Global Revolt |journal=Bulletin of the GHI |year=2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004072155/http://www.ghi-dc.org/files/publications/bu_supp/supp006/bus6_181.pdf |archivedate=4 October 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nA more severe sign of disobedience was so-called [[Croatian Spring]] of 1970 and 1971, when students in Zagreb organised demonstrations for greater civil liberties and greater Croatian autonomy, followed by mass manifestations across Croatia. The regime stifled the public protest and incarcerated the leaders, but many key Croatian representatives in the Party silently supported this cause, lobbying within the Party ranks for a reorganisation of the country. As a result, a new [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution|Constitution]] was ratified in 1974, which gave more rights to the individual republics in Yugoslavia and provinces in Serbia.\n\n===Ethnic tensions and economic crisis===\nThe Yugoslav federation was constructed against a double background: an inter-war Yugoslavia which had been dominated by the Serbian ruling class; and a war-time division of the country, as [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany]] split the country apart and endorsed an extreme Croatian nationalist faction called the [[Usta\u0161e]]. A small faction of Bosniak nationalists joined the Axis forces and attacked Serbs while extreme Serb nationalists engaged in attacks on Bosniaks and Croats.\n\n[[Yugoslav Partisans]] took over the country at the end of the war and banned nationalism from being publicly promoted. Overall relative peace was retained under Tito's rule, though nationalist protests did occur, but these were usually repressed and nationalist leaders were arrested and some were executed by Yugoslav officials. However, the \"[[Croatian Spring]]\" protest in the 1970s was backed by large numbers of Croats who claimed that Yugoslavia remained a Serb hegemony and demanded that Serbia's powers be reduced.\n\nTito, whose home republic was Croatia, was concerned over the stability of the country and responded in a manner to appease both Croats and Serbs: he ordered the arrest of the Croat protestors, while at the same time conceding to some of their demands. In 1974, Serbia's influence in the country was significantly reduced as autonomous provinces were created in ethnic Albanian-majority populated Kosovo and the mixed-populated [[Vojvodina]].\n\nThese autonomous provinces held the same voting power as the republics but unlike the republics, they could not legally separate from Yugoslavia. This concession satisfied Croatia and Slovenia, but in Serbia and in the new autonomous province of Kosovo, reaction was different. Serbs saw the new constitution as conceding to Croat and ethnic Albanian nationalists. Ethnic Albanians in Kosovo saw the creation of an autonomous province as not being enough, and demanded that Kosovo become a constituent republic with the right to separate from Yugoslavia. This created tensions within the Communist leadership, particularly among Communist Serb officials who resented the 1974 constitution as weakening Serbia's influence and jeopardising the unity of the country by allowing the republics the right to separate.\n\nAccording to official statistics, from the 1950s to the early 1980s, Yugoslavia was among the fastest growing countries, approaching the ranges reported in South Korea and other miracle countries. The unique socialist system in Yugoslavia, where factories were [[worker cooperative]]s and decision-making was less centralized than in other socialist countries, may have led to the stronger growth. However, even if the absolute value of the growth rates was not as high as indicated by the official statistics, both the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia were characterized by surprisingly high growth rates of both income and education during the 1950s.\n\nThe period of European growth ended after the oil price shock in 1970s. Following that, in Yugoslavia an economic crisis erupted, and that as a product of disastrous errors by Yugoslav governments, such as borrowing vast amounts of Western capital in order to fund growth through exports.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy. From 1500 to the Present.|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=64|isbn=978-1-107-50718-0}}</ref> At the same time, Western economies went into recession, decreasing demand for Yugoslavian imports, creating a large debt problem.\n\nIn 1989, according to official sources, 248 firms were declared bankrupt or were liquidated and 89,400 workers were laid off. During the first nine months of 1990 directly following the adoption of the IMF programme, another 889 enterprises with a combined work-force of 525,000 workers suffered the same fate. In other words, in less than two years \"the trigger mechanism\" (under the Financial Operations Act) had led to the layoff of more than 600,000 workers out of a total industrial workforce of the order of 2.7&nbsp;million. An additional 20% of the work force, or half a million people, were not paid wages during the early months of 1990 as enterprises sought to avoid bankruptcy. The largest concentrations of bankrupt firms and lay-offs were in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia and Kosovo. Real earnings were in a free fall and social programmes had collapsed; creating within the population an atmosphere of social despair and hopelessness. This was a critical turning point in the events to follow.\n\n==Breakup==\n{{Main|Breakup of Yugoslavia}}\n[[File:Breakup of Yugoslavia-TRY2.gif|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Breakup of Yugoslavia]]\nThough the 1974 Constitution reduced the power of the federal government, Tito's authority substituted for this weakness until his death in 1980.\n\nAfter Tito's death on 4 May 1980, [[Ethnic hatred|ethnic tensions]] grew in Yugoslavia. The legacy of the [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution|Constitution of 1974]] was used to throw the system of decision-making into a state of paralysis, made all the more hopeless as the conflict of interests had become irreconcilable. The Albanian majority in Kosovo demanded the status of a republic in the [[1981 protests in Kosovo]] while Serbian authorities suppressed this sentiment and proceeded to reduce the province's autonomy.<ref>John B. Allcock, et al. eds., ''Conflict in the Former Yugoslavia: An Encyclopedia'' (1998)</ref>\n\nIn 1986, the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] drafted a memorandum addressing some burning issues concerning the position of Serbs as the most numerous people in Yugoslavia. The largest Yugoslav republic in territory and population, Serbia's influence over the regions of Kosovo and Vojvodina was reduced by the 1974 Constitution. Because its two autonomous provinces had de facto prerogatives of full-fledged republics, Serbia found that its hands were tied, for the republican government was restricted in making and carrying out decisions that would apply to the provinces. Since the provinces had a vote in the Federal Presidency Council (an eight-member council composed of representatives from the six republics and the two autonomous provinces), they sometimes even entered into coalition with other republics, thus outvoting Serbia. Serbia's political impotence made it possible for others to exert pressure on the 2 million Serbs (20% of the total Serbian population) living outside Serbia.\n\nSerbian communist leader [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]] sought to restore pre-1974 Serbian sovereignty.  After Tito's death, Milosevic made his way to becoming the next superior figure and political official for Serbia.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The World Transformed 1945 to the Present|last=Hunt|first=Michael|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-19-937102-0|location=New York|pages=522}}</ref> Other republics, especially Slovenia and Croatia, denounced this move as a revival of [[greater Serbia]]n hegemonism. Through a series of moves known as the \"[[anti-bureaucratic revolution]]\", Milo\u0161evi\u0107 succeeded in reducing the autonomy of [[Vojvodina]] and of [[Kosovo|Kosovo and Metohija]], but both entities retained a vote in the Yugoslav Presidency Council. The very instrument that reduced Serbian influence before was now used to increase it: in the eight-member Council, Serbia could now count on four votes at a minimum: Serbia proper, then-loyal Montenegro, Vojvodina, and Kosovo.\n\nAs a result of these events, [[Albanians in Kosovo|ethnic Albanian]] miners in [[Kosovo]] organised the [[1989 Kosovo miners' strike]], which dovetailed into ethnic conflict between the Albanians and the non-Albanians in the province. At around 80% of the [[Demographics of Kosovo#1968-1989: Autonomy|population of Kosovo in the 1980s]], ethnic-Albanians were the majority.  With Milosevic gaining control over Kosovo in 1989, the original residency changed drastically leaving only a minimum amount of Serbians left in the region.<ref name=\":0\" /> The number of [[Slavs]] in Kosovo (mainly Serbs) was quickly declining for several reasons, among them the ever-increasing ethnic tensions and subsequent emigration from the area. By 1999 the Slavs formed as little as 10% of the total population in Kosovo.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Slovenia]], under the presidency of [[Milan Ku\u010dan]], and [[Croatia]] supported the Albanian miners and their struggle for formal recognition. Initial strikes turned into widespread demonstrations demanding a Kosovan republic. This angered Serbia's leadership which proceeded to use police force, and later even the [[Yugoslav People's Army|Federal Army]] was sent to the province by the order of the Serbia-held majority in the Yugoslav Presidency Council.\n\nIn January 1990, the extraordinary 14th Congress of the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] was convened. For most of the time, the Slovene and Serbian delegations were arguing over the future of the League of Communists and Yugoslavia. The Serbian delegation, led by Milo\u0161evi\u0107, insisted on a policy of \"''one person, one vote''\", which would empower the plurality population, the [[Serbs]]. In turn, the Slovenes, supported by Croats, sought to reform Yugoslavia by devolving even more power to republics, but were voted down. As a result, the Slovene and Croatian delegations left the Congress and the all-Yugoslav Communist party was dissolved.\n\nThe constitutional crisis that inevitably followed resulted in a rise of nationalism in all republics: Slovenia and Croatia voiced demands for looser ties within the Federation.  Following the fall of communism in Eastern Europe, each of the republics held multi-party elections in 1990. Slovenia and Croatia held the elections in April since their communist parties chose to cede power peacefully. Other Yugoslav republics\u2014especially Serbia\u2014were more or less dissatisfied with the democratisation in two of the republics and proposed different sanctions (e.g. Serbian \"customs tax\" for Slovene products) against the two, but as the year progressed, other republics' communist parties saw the inevitability of the democratisation process; in December, as the last member of the federation, Serbia held parliamentary elections which confirmed former communists' rule in this republic.\n\nThe unresolved issues however remained. In particular, Slovenia and Croatia elected governments oriented towards greater autonomy of the republics (under [[Milan Ku\u010dan]] and [[Franjo Tu\u0111man]], respectively), since it became clear that Serbian domination attempts and increasingly different levels of democratic standards were becoming increasingly incompatible. Serbia and Montenegro elected candidates who favoured Yugoslav unity.\n\nThe Croat quest for independence led to large Serb communities within Croatia rebelling and trying to secede from the Croat republic. Serbs in Croatia would not accept a status of a national minority in a sovereign Croatia, since they would be demoted from the status of a constituent nation of the entirety of Yugoslavia.\n\n===Yugoslav Wars===\n{{Main|Yugoslav Wars}}\nThe war broke out when the new regimes tried to replace Yugoslav civilian and military forces with secessionist forces. When, in August 1990, Croatia attempted to replace police in the Serb populated Croat Krajina by force, the population first looked for refuge in the Yugoslavian Army barracks, while the army remained passive. The civilians then organised armed resistance. These armed conflicts between the Croatian armed forces (\"police\") and civilians mark the beginning of the Yugoslav war that inflamed the region. Similarly, the attempt to replace Yugoslav frontier police by Slovene police forces provoked regional armed conflicts which finished with a minimal number of victims.<ref name=\"Allcock, 1998\">Allcock, et al. eds., ''Conflict in the Former Yugoslavia: An Encyclopedia'' (1998)</ref>\n\nA similar attempt in Bosnia and Herzegovina led to a war that lasted more than three years (see below). The results of all these conflicts are almost complete emigration of the Serbs from all three regions, massive displacement of the populations in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and establishment of the three new independent states. The separation of Macedonia was peaceful, although the Yugoslav Army occupied the peak of the Stra\u017ea mountain on the Macedonian soil.\n\nSerbian uprisings in Croatia began in August 1990 by blocking roads leading from the Dalmatian coast towards the interior almost a year before Croatian leadership made any move towards independence. These uprisings were more or less discreetly backed up by the Serb-dominated federal army (JNA). The Serbs in Croatia proclaimed \"Serb autonomous areas\", later united into the [[Republic of Serb Krajina]]. The federal army tried to disarm the territorial defence forces of Slovenia (republics had their local defence forces similar to the Home Guard) in 1990 but was not completely successful. Still, Slovenia began to covertly import arms to replenish its armed forces.\n\nCroatia also embarked upon the illegal import of arms, (following the disarmament of the republics' armed forces by the federal army) mainly from Hungary, and were under constant surveillance which produced a [[\u0160pegelj Tapes|video of a secret meeting]] between the Croatian Defence minister Martin \u0160pegelj and the two men, filmed by the Yugoslav counter-intelligence (''KOS, Kontra-obavje\u0161tajna slu\u017eba''). \u0160pegelj announced that they were at war with the army and gave instructions about arms smuggling as well as methods of dealing with the Yugoslav Army's officers stationed in Croatian cities. Serbia and JNA used this discovery of Croatian rearmament for propaganda purposes. Guns were also fired from army bases through Croatia. Elsewhere, tensions were running high. In the same month, the Army leaders met with the Presidency of Yugoslavia in an attempt to get them to declare a [[state of emergency]] which would allow for the army to take control of the country. The army was seen as an arm of the Serbian government by that time so the consequence feared by the other republics was to be total Serbian domination of the union. The representatives of Serbia, Montenegro, Kosovo, and Vojvodina voted for the decision, while all other republics, Croatia, Slovenia, Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, voted against. The tie delayed an escalation of conflicts, but not for long.<ref name=\"Allcock, 1998\"/>\n\nFollowing the first multi-party election results, in the autumn of 1990, the republics of Slovenia and Croatia proposed transforming Yugoslavia into a loose [[confederation]] of six republics. By this proposal, republics would have right to self-determination. However [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107|Milo\u0161evi\u0107]] rejected all such proposals, arguing that like Slovenes and Croats, the Serbs (having in mind Croatian Serbs) should also have a right to self-determination.\n\nOn 9 March 1991, demonstrations were held against Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 in [[Belgrade]], but the police and the military were deployed in the streets to restore order, killing two people. In late March 1991, the [[Plitvice Lakes incident]] was one of the first sparks of open war in Croatia. The [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA), whose superior officers were mainly of Serbian ethnicity, maintained an impression of being neutral, but as time went on, they got more and more involved in state politics.\n\nOn 25 June 1991, Slovenia and Croatia became the first republics to declare [[independence]] from Yugoslavia. The federal customs officers in Slovenia on the border crossings with Italy, Austria, and Hungary mainly just changed uniforms since most of them were local Slovenes. The following day (26 June), the Federal Executive Council specifically ordered the army to take control of the \"internationally recognized borders\", leading to the [[Ten-Day War]]. As Slovenia and Croatia fought towards independence, &nbsp;the Serbian and Croatian forces indulged into a violent and perilous rivalry.&nbsp;<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe [[Yugoslav People's Army]] forces, based in barracks in Slovenia and Croatia, attempted to carry out the task within the next 48 hours. However, because of misinformation given to the Yugoslav Army conscripts that the Federation was under attack by foreign forces and the fact that the majority of them did not wish to engage in a war on the ground where they served their conscription, the Slovene territorial defence forces retook most of the posts within several days with only minimal loss of life on both sides.\n\nThere was a suspected incident of a war crime, as the Austrian [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF TV network]] showed [[Ten-Day War#Holmec incident|footage]] of three Yugoslav Army soldiers surrendering to the territorial defence force, before gunfire was heard and the troops were seen falling down. However, none were killed in the incident. There were however numerous cases of destruction of civilian property and civilian life by the Yugoslav People's Army, including houses and a church. A civilian airport, along with a hangar and aircraft inside the hangar, was bombarded; truck drivers on the road from Ljubljana to Zagreb and Austrian journalists at the [[Ljubljana Airport]] were killed.\n\nA ceasefire was eventually agreed upon. According to the [[Brioni Agreement]], recognised by representatives of all republics, the international community pressured Slovenia and Croatia to place a three-month [[Debt moratorium|moratorium]] on their independence.\n\nDuring these three months, the Yugoslav Army completed its pull-out from Slovenia, but in Croatia, a bloody [[War in Croatia|war]] broke out in the autumn of 1991. Ethnic Serbs, who had created their own state [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]] in heavily Serb-populated regions resisted the police forces of the Republic of Croatia who were trying to bring that breakaway region back under Croatian jurisdiction. In some strategic places, the Yugoslav Army acted as a buffer zone; in most others it was protecting or aiding Serbs with resources and even manpower in their confrontation with the new Croatian army and their police force.\n\nIn September 1991, the [[Republic of Macedonia]] also declared independence, becoming the only former republic to gain sovereignty without resistance from the Belgrade-based Yugoslav authorities. 500 US soldiers were then deployed under the UN banner to monitor Macedonia's northern borders with the Republic of Serbia. Macedonia's first president, [[Kiro Gligorov]], maintained good relations with Belgrade and the other breakaway republics and there have to date been no problems between Macedonian and Serbian border police even though small pockets of Kosovo and the [[Pre\u0161evo]] valley complete the northern reaches of the historical region known as Macedonia (Prohor P\u010dinjski part), which would otherwise create a border dispute if ever Macedonian nationalism should resurface (''see [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization|VMRO]]''). This was despite the fact that the Yugoslav Army refused to abandon its military infrastructure on the top of the Stra\u017ea Mountain up to the year 2000.\n\nAs a result of the conflict, the [[United Nations Security Council]] unanimously adopted [[UN Security Council Resolution 721]] on 27 November 1991, which paved the way to the establishment of [[peacekeeping]] operations in Yugoslavia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nato.int/ifor/un/u911127a.htm |title=Resolution 721 |date=25 September 1991 |work=N.A.T.O. |accessdate=21 July 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060629130641/http://www.nato.int/ifor/un/u911127a.htm |archive-date=29 June 2006 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina in November 1991, the Bosnian Serbs held a referendum which resulted in an overwhelming vote in favour of forming a Serbian republic within the borders of Bosnia and Herzegovina and staying in a common state with Serbia and Montenegro. On 9 January 1992, the self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb assembly proclaimed a separate \"Republic of the Serb people of Bosnia and Herzegovina\". The referendum and creation of SARs were proclaimed [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] by the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina and declared illegal and invalid. However, in February\u2013March 1992, the government held a national referendum on Bosnian independence from Yugoslavia. That referendum was in turn declared contrary to the BiH and the Federal constitution by the federal Constitutional Court in Belgrade and the newly established Bosnian Serb government.\n\nThe referendum was largely boycotted by the Bosnian Serbs. The Federal court in Belgrade did not decide on the matter of the referendum of the Bosnian Serbs. The turnout was somewhere between 64\u201367% and 98% of the voters voted for independence. It was not clear what the two-thirds majority requirement actually meant and whether it was satisfied. The republic's government declared its independence on 5 April, and the Serbs immediately declared the independence of ''Republika Srpska''. The [[Bosnian war|war in Bosnia]] followed shortly thereafter.\n\n===Timeline===\nVarious dates are considered the end of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia:\n*25 June 1991, when [[Croatia]] and [[Slovenia]] declared independence\n*8 September 1991, following a referendum the [[Republic of Macedonia]] declared independence\n*8 October 1991, when the 9 July moratorium on Slovene and Croatian secession ended and Croatia restated its independence in the Croatian Parliament (that day is celebrated as Independence Day in Croatia)\n*15 January 1992, when Slovenia and Croatia were internationally recognised by most European countries\n*6 April 1992, full recognition of [[Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia and Herzegovina]]'s independence by the U.S. and most European states\n*28 April 1992, the [[Serbia and Montenegro|Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] is formed\n*14 December 1995, the [[Dayton Agreement]] is signed by the leaders of FR Yugoslavia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Croatia\n\n==New states==\n===Succession, 1992\u20132003===\n{{multiple image\n|align=right\n|direction=vertical\n|width=250\n|header=\n|image1=Map of war in Yugoslavia, 1992.png|caption1=Yugoslavia at the time of its dissolution, early 1992\n|image2=Former Yugoslavia 2008.PNG|caption2=The state of affairs of the territory of the former Yugoslavia, 2008\n}}\nAs the [[Yugoslav Wars]] raged through Croatia and Bosnia, the republics of Serbia and Montenegro, which remained relatively untouched by the war, formed a [[rump state]] known as the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (FRY) in 1992.

The [[Serbo-Croatian language]] is linguistically a single language, with several literary and spoken variants since the language of the government was imposed where other languages dominated ([[Socialist Republic of Slovenia|Slovenia]], [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]). Now, separate sociolinguistic standards exist for the [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] languages.\n\nRemembrance of the time of the joint state and its positive attributes is referred to as ''[[Yugonostalgia]]''.\nMany aspects of Yugonostalgia refer to the socialist system and the sense of social security it provided.

Of the many religions, Islam, Roman Catholicism, Judaism, and Protestantism, as well as various [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Orthodox]] faiths, composed the religions of Yugoslavia, comprising over 40 in all. The religious demographics of Yugoslavia changed dramatically since World War II. A census taken in 1921 and later in 1948 show that 99% of the population appeared to be deeply involved with their religion and practices. With postwar government programs of modernisation and urbanisation, the percentage of religious believers took a dramatic plunge. Connections between religious belief and nationality posed a serious threat to the post-war Communist government's policies on national unity and state structure.<ref name=\"atheism.about.com\">{{cite web |url=http://atheism.about.com/library/world/KZ/bl_YugoReligionDemography.htm |title=Yugoslavia \u2013 Religious Demographics |publisher=Atheism.about.com |date=2009-12-16 |accessdate=2013-04-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424102013/http://atheism.about.com/library/world/KZ/bl_YugoReligionDemography.htm |archive-date=24 April 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAfter the rise of communism, a survey taken in 1964 showed that just over 70% of the total population of Yugoslavia considered themselves to be religious believers.

The places of lowest religious concentration were [[Slovenia]] 65.4%, [[Serbia]] with 63.7% and [[Croatia]] with 63.6%.

In 1944 King [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter II]], then living in exile, recognised it as the legitimate government. The monarchy was subsequently abolished in November 1945. Yugoslavia was renamed the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia in 1946, when a communist government was established. It acquired the territories of [[Istria]], [[Rijeka]], and [[Zadar]] from Italy. Partisan leader [[Josip Broz Tito]] ruled the country as president until his death in 1980. In 1963, the country was renamed again, as the ''[[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]'' (SFRY).\n\nThe six constituent republics that made up the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFRY]] were the [[Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|SR Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Socialist Republic of Croatia|SR Croatia]], [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia|SR Macedonia]], [[Socialist Republic of Montenegro|SR Montenegro]], [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|SR Serbia]], and [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia|SR Slovenia]].

The name was created by the combination of the Slavic words \"jug\" (south) and \"slaveni\" (Slavs). Yugoslavia was the result of the [[Corfu Declaration]], as a project of the Serbian Parliament in exile and the Serbian royal [[Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasty]], who became the Yugoslav royal dynasty.\n\n==Kingdom of Yugoslavia==\n{{Main|Kingdom of Yugoslavia}}\n{{multiple image\n|align=right\n|direction=vertical\n|width=210\n|header=\n|image1=\n|image2=Banovine Jugoslavia.png|caption2=[[Subdivisions of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Banovinas]] of Yugoslavia, 1929\u201339. After 1939 the Sava and Littoral banovinas were merged into the [[Banovina of Croatia]].\n}}\n\nThe country was formed in 1918 immediately after World War I as the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes by union of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] and the [[Kingdom of Serbia]]. It was commonly referred to at the time as the \"[[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles]] state\". Later, the government renamed the country leading to the first official use of ''Yugoslavia'' in 1929.\n\n===King Alexander===\nOn 20 June 1928, Serb deputy [[Puni\u0161a Ra\u010di\u0107]] shot at five members of the opposition Croatian Peasant Party in the [[Parliament of Yugoslavia|National Assembly]] resulting in the death of two deputies on the spot and that of leader [[Stjepan Radi\u0107]] a few weeks later.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=73}} On 6 January 1929, [[King of Yugoslavia|King]] [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander I]] suspended the constitution, banned national political parties, assumed executive power and renamed the country Yugoslavia.<ref>{{cite web |url =http://www.indiana.edu/~league/1929.htm |title =Chronology 1929 |author =''[[Indiana University]]'' |publisher =indiana.edu |date =October 2002 |access-date =8 February 2014 |archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20150222035557/http://www.indiana.edu/~league/1929.htm |archive-date =22 February 2015 |url-status =live }}</ref> He hoped to curb separatist tendencies and mitigate nationalist passions.

None of these three regimes favored the policy pursued by Alexander I. In fact, Italy and Germany wanted to revise the international treaties signed after World War I, and the Soviets were determined to regain their positions in Europe and pursue a more active international policy.\n\nAlexander attempted to create a centralised Yugoslavia. He decided to abolish Yugoslavia's historic regions, and new internal boundaries were drawn for provinces or banovinas. The banovinas were named after rivers. Many politicians were jailed or kept under police surveillance. The effect of Alexander's dictatorship was to further alienate the non-Serbs from the idea of unity.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xcp7OXQE0FMC&pg=PA624 |title=The Balkans since 1453 |page=624 |isbn=9781850655510 |last1=Stavrianos |first1=Leften Stavros |year=2000 |access-date=17 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016040853/https://books.google.com/books?id=xcp7OXQE0FMC&pg=PA624 |archive-date=16 October 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> During his reign the flags of Yugoslav nations were banned. Communist ideas were banned also.\n\nThe king was assassinated in [[Marseille]] during an official visit to France in 1934 by [[Vlado Chernozemski]], an experienced marksman from [[Ivan Mihailov]]'s [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] with the cooperation of the [[Usta\u0161e]], a Croatian fascist revolutionary organisation. Alexander was succeeded by his eleven-year-old son [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter II]] and a regency council headed by his cousin, [[Prince Paul of Yugoslavia|Prince Paul]].\n\n===1934\u20131941===\nThe international political scene in the late 1930s was marked by growing intolerance between the principal figures, by the aggressive attitude of the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regimes and by the certainty that the order set up after World War I was losing its strongholds and its sponsors were losing their strength. Supported and pressured by [[Italian fascism|Fascist Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany]], Croatian leader [[Vladko Ma\u010dek]] and his party managed the creation of the [[Banovina of Croatia]] (Autonomous Region with significant internal self-government) in 1939. The agreement specified that Croatia was to remain part of Yugoslavia, but it was hurriedly building an independent political identity in international relations. The entire kingdom was to be federalised but World War II stopped the fulfillment of those plans.\n\nPrince Paul submitted to the fascist pressure and signed the [[Tripartite Pact]] in Vienna on 25 March 1941, hoping to still keep Yugoslavia out of the war. But this was at the expense of popular support for Paul's regency. Senior military officers were also opposed to the treaty and launched a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] when the king returned on [[Yugoslav military coup of March 27, 1941|27 March]]. Army General [[Du\u0161an Simovi\u0107]] seized power, arrested the Vienna delegation, exiled Paul, and ended the regency, giving 17-year-old [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|King Peter]] full powers.

The [[Independent State of Croatia]] was established as a [[Nazi]] satellite state, ruled by the fascist militia known as the [[Usta\u0161e]] that came into existence in 1929, but was relatively limited in its activities until 1941. German troops occupied [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] and [[Herzegovina]] as well as part of [[Serbia]] and [[Slovenia]], while other parts of the country were occupied by [[Bulgaria]], Hungary, and Italy. From 1941\u201345, the Croatian [[Usta\u0161e]] regime murdered around 500,000 people, 250,000 were expelled, and another 200,000 were forced to convert to [[Catholicism]].\n\nFrom the start, the Yugoslav resistance forces consisted of two factions: the communist-led [[Yugoslav Partisans]] and the royalist [[Chetniks]], with the former receiving Allied recognition only at the Tehran conference (1943). The heavily pro-Serbian Chetniks were led by [[Dra\u017ea Mihajlovi\u0107]], while the pan-Yugoslav oriented Partisans were led by [[Josip Broz Tito]].\n\nThe Partisans initiated a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] campaign that developed into the largest resistance army in occupied Western and Central Europe. The Chetniks were initially supported by the exiled royal government and the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], but they soon focused increasingly on combating the Partisans rather than the occupying Axis forces. By the end of the war, the Chetnik movement transformed into a collaborationist Serb nationalist militia completely dependent on Axis supplies.<ref>7David Martin, Ally Betrayed: The Uncensored Story of Tito and Mihailovich, (New York: Prentice Hall, 1946), 34.</ref> The highly mobile Partisans, however, carried on their guerrilla warfare with great success. Most notable of the victories against the occupying forces were the battles of [[Battle of Neretva|Neretva]] and [[Battle of Sutjeska|Sutjeska]].\n\nOn 25 November 1942, the [[AVNOJ|Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia]] was convened in [[Biha\u0107]], modern day [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The council reconvened on 29 November 1943, in [[Jajce]], also in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and established the basis for post-war organisation of the country, establishing a federation (this date was celebrated as Republic Day after the war).\n\nThe [[Yugoslav Partisans]] were able to expel the Axis from Serbia in 1944 and the rest of Yugoslavia in 1945. The [[Red Army]] provided limited assistance with the liberation of [[Belgrade]] and withdrew after the war was over. In May 1945, the Partisans met with Allied forces outside former Yugoslav borders, after also taking over [[Trieste]] and parts of the southern Austrian provinces of [[Styria]] and [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]]. However, the Partisans withdrew from Trieste in June of the same year under heavy pressure from Stalin, who did not want a confrontation with the other Allies.\n\nWestern attempts to reunite the Partisans, who denied the supremacy of the old government of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], and the \u00e9migr\u00e9s loyal to the king led to the [[Tito-\u0160uba\u0161i\u0107 Agreement]] in June 1944; however, [[Marshal of Yugoslavia|Marshal]] Josip Broz Tito was in control and was determined to lead an independent communist state, starting as a prime minister.  He had the support of Moscow and London and led by far the strongest partisan force with 800,000 men.<ref>Michael Lees, ''The Rape of Serbia: The British Role in Tito's Grab for Power, 1943\u20131944'' (1990).</ref><ref>{{cite book|author1=James R.

Tito, at first went along and rejected the Marshall plan. However, in 1948 Tito broke decisively with Stalin on other issues, making Yugoslavia an independent communist state. Yugoslavia requested American aid. American leaders were internally divided, but finally agreed and began sending money on a small scale in 1949, and on a much larger scale 1950\u201353. The American aid was not part of the Marshall plan.<ref>{{cite book|author=John R.

In Slovenia the recognized minorities were Hungarians and Italians.\n\n[[Vojvodina]] and [[Kosovo|Kosovo-Metohija]] formed a part of the Republic of [[Serbia]] but those provinces also formed part of the federation, which led to the unique situation that [[Central Serbia]] did not have its own assembly but a joint assembly with its provinces represented in it.\n\n==SFR Yugoslavia==\n[[File:Josip Broz Tito uniform portrait.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|right|Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]]]]\n{{Main|Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia}}\n\nOn 7 April 1963, the nation changed its official name to [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] and Josip Broz Tito was named [[President for life]]. In the SFRY, each republic and province had its own constitution, supreme court, parliament, president and prime minister. At the top of the Yugoslav government were the President (Tito), the federal Prime Minister, and the federal Parliament (a collective Presidency was formed after Tito's death in 1980). Also important were the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia|Communist Party]] general secretaries for each republic and province, and the general secretary of Central Committee of the Communist Party.\n\nTito was the most powerful person in the country, followed by republican and provincial premiers and presidents, and Communist Party presidents. Slobodan Penezi\u0107 Krcun, Tito's chief of secret police in Serbia, fell victim to a dubious traffic incident after he started to complain about Tito's politics. Minister of the interior [[Aleksandar Rankovi\u0107]] lost all of his titles and rights after a major disagreement with Tito regarding state politics. Some influential ministers in government, such as [[Edvard Kardelj]] or [[Stane Dolanc]], were more important than the Prime Minister.\n\nFirst cracks in the tightly governed system surfaced when [[1968 student demonstrations in Belgrade|students in Belgrade and several other cities joined]] the worldwide [[protests of 1968]]. President Josip Broz Tito gradually stopped the protests by giving in to some of the students' demands and saying that \"students are right\" during a televised speech. But in the following years, he dealt with the leaders of the protests by sacking them from university and Communist party posts.<ref>{{cite journal |last=\u017dilnik |first=\u017delimir |url=http://www.ghi-dc.org/files/publications/bu_supp/supp006/bus6_181.pdf |title=Yugoslavia: \"Down with the Red Bourgeoisie!\" |issue=1968: Memories and Legacies of a Global Revolt |journal=Bulletin of the GHI |year=2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004072155/http://www.ghi-dc.org/files/publications/bu_supp/supp006/bus6_181.pdf |archivedate=4 October 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nA more severe sign of disobedience was so-called [[Croatian Spring]] of 1970 and 1971, when students in Zagreb organised demonstrations for greater civil liberties and greater Croatian autonomy, followed by mass manifestations across Croatia. The regime stifled the public protest and incarcerated the leaders, but many key Croatian representatives in the Party silently supported this cause, lobbying within the Party ranks for a reorganisation of the country. As a result, a new [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution|Constitution]] was ratified in 1974, which gave more rights to the individual republics in Yugoslavia and provinces in Serbia.\n\n===Ethnic tensions and economic crisis===\nThe Yugoslav federation was constructed against a double background: an inter-war Yugoslavia which had been dominated by the Serbian ruling class; and a war-time division of the country, as [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany]] split the country apart and endorsed an extreme Croatian nationalist faction called the [[Usta\u0161e]]. A small faction of Bosniak nationalists joined the Axis forces and attacked Serbs while extreme Serb nationalists engaged in attacks on Bosniaks and Croats.\n\n[[Yugoslav Partisans]] took over the country at the end of the war and banned nationalism from being publicly promoted. Overall relative peace was retained under Tito's rule, though nationalist protests did occur, but these were usually repressed and nationalist leaders were arrested and some were executed by Yugoslav officials. However, the \"[[Croatian Spring]]\" protest in the 1970s was backed by large numbers of Croats who claimed that Yugoslavia remained a Serb hegemony and demanded that Serbia's powers be reduced.\n\nTito, whose home republic was Croatia, was concerned over the stability of the country and responded in a manner to appease both Croats and Serbs: he ordered the arrest of the Croat protestors, while at the same time conceding to some of their demands. In 1974, Serbia's influence in the country was significantly reduced as autonomous provinces were created in ethnic Albanian-majority populated Kosovo and the mixed-populated [[Vojvodina]].\n\nThese autonomous provinces held the same voting power as the republics but unlike the republics, they could not legally separate from Yugoslavia. This concession satisfied Croatia and Slovenia, but in Serbia and in the new autonomous province of Kosovo, reaction was different. Serbs saw the new constitution as conceding to Croat and ethnic Albanian nationalists. Ethnic Albanians in Kosovo saw the creation of an autonomous province as not being enough, and demanded that Kosovo become a constituent republic with the right to separate from Yugoslavia. This created tensions within the Communist leadership, particularly among Communist Serb officials who resented the 1974 constitution as weakening Serbia's influence and jeopardising the unity of the country by allowing the republics the right to separate.\n\nAccording to official statistics, from the 1950s to the early 1980s, Yugoslavia was among the fastest growing countries, approaching the ranges reported in South Korea and other miracle countries. The unique socialist system in Yugoslavia, where factories were [[worker cooperative]]s and decision-making was less centralized than in other socialist countries, may have led to the stronger growth. However, even if the absolute value of the growth rates was not as high as indicated by the official statistics, both the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia were characterized by surprisingly high growth rates of both income and education during the 1950s.\n\nThe period of European growth ended after the oil price shock in 1970s. Following that, in Yugoslavia an economic crisis erupted, and that as a product of disastrous errors by Yugoslav governments, such as borrowing vast amounts of Western capital in order to fund growth through exports.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy. From 1500 to the Present.|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=64|isbn=978-1-107-50718-0}}</ref> At the same time, Western economies went into recession, decreasing demand for Yugoslavian imports, creating a large debt problem.\n\nIn 1989, according to official sources, 248 firms were declared bankrupt or were liquidated and 89,400 workers were laid off. During the first nine months of 1990 directly following the adoption of the IMF programme, another 889 enterprises with a combined work-force of 525,000 workers suffered the same fate. In other words, in less than two years \"the trigger mechanism\" (under the Financial Operations Act) had led to the layoff of more than 600,000 workers out of a total industrial workforce of the order of 2.7&nbsp;million. An additional 20% of the work force, or half a million people, were not paid wages during the early months of 1990 as enterprises sought to avoid bankruptcy. The largest concentrations of bankrupt firms and lay-offs were in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia and Kosovo. Real earnings were in a free fall and social programmes had collapsed; creating within the population an atmosphere of social despair and hopelessness. This was a critical turning point in the events to follow.\n\n==Breakup==\n{{Main|Breakup of Yugoslavia}}\n[[File:Breakup of Yugoslavia-TRY2.gif|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Breakup of Yugoslavia]]\nThough the 1974 Constitution reduced the power of the federal government, Tito's authority substituted for this weakness until his death in 1980.\n\nAfter Tito's death on 4 May 1980, [[Ethnic hatred|ethnic tensions]] grew in Yugoslavia. The legacy of the [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution|Constitution of 1974]] was used to throw the system of decision-making into a state of paralysis, made all the more hopeless as the conflict of interests had become irreconcilable. The Albanian majority in Kosovo demanded the status of a republic in the [[1981 protests in Kosovo]] while Serbian authorities suppressed this sentiment and proceeded to reduce the province's autonomy.<ref>John B. Allcock, et al. eds., ''Conflict in the Former Yugoslavia: An Encyclopedia'' (1998)</ref>\n\nIn 1986, the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] drafted a memorandum addressing some burning issues concerning the position of Serbs as the most numerous people in Yugoslavia. The largest Yugoslav republic in territory and population, Serbia's influence over the regions of Kosovo and Vojvodina was reduced by the 1974 Constitution. Because its two autonomous provinces had de facto prerogatives of full-fledged republics, Serbia found that its hands were tied, for the republican government was restricted in making and carrying out decisions that would apply to the provinces. Since the provinces had a vote in the Federal Presidency Council (an eight-member council composed of representatives from the six republics and the two autonomous provinces), they sometimes even entered into coalition with other republics, thus outvoting Serbia. Serbia's political impotence made it possible for others to exert pressure on the 2 million Serbs (20% of the total Serbian population) living outside Serbia.\n\nSerbian communist leader [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]] sought to restore pre-1974 Serbian sovereignty.  After Tito's death, Milosevic made his way to becoming the next superior figure and political official for Serbia.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The World Transformed 1945 to the Present|last=Hunt|first=Michael|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-19-937102-0|location=New York|pages=522}}</ref> Other republics, especially Slovenia and Croatia, denounced this move as a revival of [[greater Serbia]]n hegemonism. Through a series of moves known as the \"[[anti-bureaucratic revolution]]\", Milo\u0161evi\u0107 succeeded in reducing the autonomy of [[Vojvodina]] and of [[Kosovo|Kosovo and Metohija]], but both entities retained a vote in the Yugoslav Presidency Council. The very instrument that reduced Serbian influence before was now used to increase it: in the eight-member Council, Serbia could now count on four votes at a minimum: Serbia proper, then-loyal Montenegro, Vojvodina, and Kosovo.\n\nAs a result of these events, [[Albanians in Kosovo|ethnic Albanian]] miners in [[Kosovo]] organised the [[1989 Kosovo miners' strike]], which dovetailed into ethnic conflict between the Albanians and the non-Albanians in the province. At around 80% of the [[Demographics of Kosovo#1968-1989: Autonomy|population of Kosovo in the 1980s]], ethnic-Albanians were the majority.  With Milosevic gaining control over Kosovo in 1989, the original residency changed drastically leaving only a minimum amount of Serbians left in the region.<ref name=\":0\" /> The number of [[Slavs]] in Kosovo (mainly Serbs) was quickly declining for several reasons, among them the ever-increasing ethnic tensions and subsequent emigration from the area. By 1999 the Slavs formed as little as 10% of the total population in Kosovo.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Slovenia]], under the presidency of [[Milan Ku\u010dan]], and [[Croatia]] supported the Albanian miners and their struggle for formal recognition. Initial strikes turned into widespread demonstrations demanding a Kosovan republic. This angered Serbia's leadership which proceeded to use police force, and later even the [[Yugoslav People's Army|Federal Army]] was sent to the province by the order of the Serbia-held majority in the Yugoslav Presidency Council.\n\nIn January 1990, the extraordinary 14th Congress of the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] was convened. For most of the time, the Slovene and Serbian delegations were arguing over the future of the League of Communists and Yugoslavia. The Serbian delegation, led by Milo\u0161evi\u0107, insisted on a policy of \"''one person, one vote''\", which would empower the plurality population, the [[Serbs]]. In turn, the Slovenes, supported by Croats, sought to reform Yugoslavia by devolving even more power to republics, but were voted down. As a result, the Slovene and Croatian delegations left the Congress and the all-Yugoslav Communist party was dissolved.\n\nThe constitutional crisis that inevitably followed resulted in a rise of nationalism in all republics: Slovenia and Croatia voiced demands for looser ties within the Federation.  Following the fall of communism in Eastern Europe, each of the republics held multi-party elections in 1990. Slovenia and Croatia held the elections in April since their communist parties chose to cede power peacefully. Other Yugoslav republics\u2014especially Serbia\u2014were more or less dissatisfied with the democratisation in two of the republics and proposed different sanctions (e.g. Serbian \"customs tax\" for Slovene products) against the two, but as the year progressed, other republics' communist parties saw the inevitability of the democratisation process; in December, as the last member of the federation, Serbia held parliamentary elections which confirmed former communists' rule in this republic.\n\nThe unresolved issues however remained. In particular, Slovenia and Croatia elected governments oriented towards greater autonomy of the republics (under [[Milan Ku\u010dan]] and [[Franjo Tu\u0111man]], respectively), since it became clear that Serbian domination attempts and increasingly different levels of democratic standards were becoming increasingly incompatible. Serbia and Montenegro elected candidates who favoured Yugoslav unity.\n\nThe Croat quest for independence led to large Serb communities within Croatia rebelling and trying to secede from the Croat republic. Serbs in Croatia would not accept a status of a national minority in a sovereign Croatia, since they would be demoted from the status of a constituent nation of the entirety of Yugoslavia.\n\n===Yugoslav Wars===\n{{Main|Yugoslav Wars}}\nThe war broke out when the new regimes tried to replace Yugoslav civilian and military forces with secessionist forces. When, in August 1990, Croatia attempted to replace police in the Serb populated Croat Krajina by force, the population first looked for refuge in the Yugoslavian Army barracks, while the army remained passive. The civilians then organised armed resistance. These armed conflicts between the Croatian armed forces (\"police\") and civilians mark the beginning of the Yugoslav war that inflamed the region. Similarly, the attempt to replace Yugoslav frontier police by Slovene police forces provoked regional armed conflicts which finished with a minimal number of victims.<ref name=\"Allcock, 1998\">Allcock, et al. eds., ''Conflict in the Former Yugoslavia: An Encyclopedia'' (1998)</ref>\n\nA similar attempt in Bosnia and Herzegovina led to a war that lasted more than three years (see below). The results of all these conflicts are almost complete emigration of the Serbs from all three regions, massive displacement of the populations in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and establishment of the three new independent states. The separation of Macedonia was peaceful, although the Yugoslav Army occupied the peak of the Stra\u017ea mountain on the Macedonian soil.\n\nSerbian uprisings in Croatia began in August 1990 by blocking roads leading from the Dalmatian coast towards the interior almost a year before Croatian leadership made any move towards independence. These uprisings were more or less discreetly backed up by the Serb-dominated federal army (JNA). The Serbs in Croatia proclaimed \"Serb autonomous areas\", later united into the [[Republic of Serb Krajina]]. The federal army tried to disarm the territorial defence forces of Slovenia (republics had their local defence forces similar to the Home Guard) in 1990 but was not completely successful. Still, Slovenia began to covertly import arms to replenish its armed forces.\n\nCroatia also embarked upon the illegal import of arms, (following the disarmament of the republics' armed forces by the federal army) mainly from Hungary, and were under constant surveillance which produced a [[\u0160pegelj Tapes|video of a secret meeting]] between the Croatian Defence minister Martin \u0160pegelj and the two men, filmed by the Yugoslav counter-intelligence (''KOS, Kontra-obavje\u0161tajna slu\u017eba''). \u0160pegelj announced that they were at war with the army and gave instructions about arms smuggling as well as methods of dealing with the Yugoslav Army's officers stationed in Croatian cities. Serbia and JNA used this discovery of Croatian rearmament for propaganda purposes. Guns were also fired from army bases through Croatia. Elsewhere, tensions were running high. In the same month, the Army leaders met with the Presidency of Yugoslavia in an attempt to get them to declare a [[state of emergency]] which would allow for the army to take control of the country. The army was seen as an arm of the Serbian government by that time so the consequence feared by the other republics was to be total Serbian domination of the union. The representatives of Serbia, Montenegro, Kosovo, and Vojvodina voted for the decision, while all other republics, Croatia, Slovenia, Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, voted against. The tie delayed an escalation of conflicts, but not for long.<ref name=\"Allcock, 1998\"/>\n\nFollowing the first multi-party election results, in the autumn of 1990, the republics of Slovenia and Croatia proposed transforming Yugoslavia into a loose [[confederation]] of six republics. By this proposal, republics would have right to self-determination. However [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107|Milo\u0161evi\u0107]] rejected all such proposals, arguing that like Slovenes and Croats, the Serbs (having in mind Croatian Serbs) should also have a right to self-determination.\n\nOn 9 March 1991, demonstrations were held against Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 in [[Belgrade]], but the police and the military were deployed in the streets to restore order, killing two people. In late March 1991, the [[Plitvice Lakes incident]] was one of the first sparks of open war in Croatia. The [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA), whose superior officers were mainly of Serbian ethnicity, maintained an impression of being neutral, but as time went on, they got more and more involved in state politics.\n\nOn 25 June 1991, Slovenia and Croatia became the first republics to declare [[independence]] from Yugoslavia. The federal customs officers in Slovenia on the border crossings with Italy, Austria, and Hungary mainly just changed uniforms since most of them were local Slovenes. The following day (26 June), the Federal Executive Council specifically ordered the army to take control of the \"internationally recognized borders\", leading to the [[Ten-Day War]]. As Slovenia and Croatia fought towards independence, &nbsp;the Serbian and Croatian forces indulged into a violent and perilous rivalry.&nbsp;<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe [[Yugoslav People's Army]] forces, based in barracks in Slovenia and Croatia, attempted to carry out the task within the next 48 hours. However, because of misinformation given to the Yugoslav Army conscripts that the Federation was under attack by foreign forces and the fact that the majority of them did not wish to engage in a war on the ground where they served their conscription, the Slovene territorial defence forces retook most of the posts within several days with only minimal loss of life on both sides.\n\nThere was a suspected incident of a war crime, as the Austrian [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF TV network]] showed [[Ten-Day War#Holmec incident|footage]] of three Yugoslav Army soldiers surrendering to the territorial defence force, before gunfire was heard and the troops were seen falling down. However, none were killed in the incident. There were however numerous cases of destruction of civilian property and civilian life by the Yugoslav People's Army, including houses and a church. A civilian airport, along with a hangar and aircraft inside the hangar, was bombarded; truck drivers on the road from Ljubljana to Zagreb and Austrian journalists at the [[Ljubljana Airport]] were killed.\n\nA ceasefire was eventually agreed upon. According to the [[Brioni Agreement]], recognised by representatives of all republics, the international community pressured Slovenia and Croatia to place a three-month [[Debt moratorium|moratorium]] on their independence.\n\nDuring these three months, the Yugoslav Army completed its pull-out from Slovenia, but in Croatia, a bloody [[War in Croatia|war]] broke out in the autumn of 1991. Ethnic Serbs, who had created their own state [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]] in heavily Serb-populated regions resisted the police forces of the Republic of Croatia who were trying to bring that breakaway region back under Croatian jurisdiction. In some strategic places, the Yugoslav Army acted as a buffer zone; in most others it was protecting or aiding Serbs with resources and even manpower in their confrontation with the new Croatian army and their police force.\n\nIn September 1991, the [[Republic of Macedonia]] also declared independence, becoming the only former republic to gain sovereignty without resistance from the Belgrade-based Yugoslav authorities. 500 US soldiers were then deployed under the UN banner to monitor Macedonia's northern borders with the Republic of Serbia. Macedonia's first president, [[Kiro Gligorov]], maintained good relations with Belgrade and the other breakaway republics and there have to date been no problems between Macedonian and Serbian border police even though small pockets of Kosovo and the [[Pre\u0161evo]] valley complete the northern reaches of the historical region known as Macedonia (Prohor P\u010dinjski part), which would otherwise create a border dispute if ever Macedonian nationalism should resurface (''see [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization|VMRO]]''). This was despite the fact that the Yugoslav Army refused to abandon its military infrastructure on the top of the Stra\u017ea Mountain up to the year 2000.\n\nAs a result of the conflict, the [[United Nations Security Council]] unanimously adopted [[UN Security Council Resolution 721]] on 27 November 1991, which paved the way to the establishment of [[peacekeeping]] operations in Yugoslavia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nato.int/ifor/un/u911127a.htm |title=Resolution 721 |date=25 September 1991 |work=N.A.T.O. |accessdate=21 July 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060629130641/http://www.nato.int/ifor/un/u911127a.htm |archive-date=29 June 2006 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina in November 1991, the Bosnian Serbs held a referendum which resulted in an overwhelming vote in favour of forming a Serbian republic within the borders of Bosnia and Herzegovina and staying in a common state with Serbia and Montenegro. On 9 January 1992, the self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb assembly proclaimed a separate \"Republic of the Serb people of Bosnia and Herzegovina\". The referendum and creation of SARs were proclaimed [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] by the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina and declared illegal and invalid. However, in February\u2013March 1992, the government held a national referendum on Bosnian independence from Yugoslavia. That referendum was in turn declared contrary to the BiH and the Federal constitution by the federal Constitutional Court in Belgrade and the newly established Bosnian Serb government.\n\nThe referendum was largely boycotted by the Bosnian Serbs. The Federal court in Belgrade did not decide on the matter of the referendum of the Bosnian Serbs. The turnout was somewhere between 64\u201367% and 98% of the voters voted for independence. It was not clear what the two-thirds majority requirement actually meant and whether it was satisfied. The republic's government declared its independence on 5 April, and the Serbs immediately declared the independence of ''Republika Srpska''. The [[Bosnian war|war in Bosnia]] followed shortly thereafter.\n\n===Timeline===\nVarious dates are considered the end of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia:\n*25 June 1991, when [[Croatia]] and [[Slovenia]] declared independence\n*8 September 1991, following a referendum the [[Republic of Macedonia]] declared independence\n*8 October 1991, when the 9 July moratorium on Slovene and Croatian secession ended and Croatia restated its independence in the Croatian Parliament (that day is celebrated as Independence Day in Croatia)\n*15 January 1992, when Slovenia and Croatia were internationally recognised by most European countries\n*6 April 1992, full recognition of [[Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia and Herzegovina]]'s independence by the U.S. and most European states\n*28 April 1992, the [[Serbia and Montenegro|Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] is formed\n*14 December 1995, the [[Dayton Agreement]] is signed by the leaders of FR Yugoslavia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Croatia\n\n==New states==\n===Succession, 1992\u20132003===\n{{multiple image\n|align=right\n|direction=vertical\n|width=250\n|header=\n|image1=Map of war in Yugoslavia, 1992.png|caption1=Yugoslavia at the time of its dissolution, early 1992\n|image2=Former Yugoslavia 2008.PNG|caption2=The state of affairs of the territory of the former Yugoslavia, 2008\n}}\nAs the [[Yugoslav Wars]] raged through Croatia and Bosnia, the republics of Serbia and Montenegro, which remained relatively untouched by the war, formed a [[rump state]] known as the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (FRY) in 1992.

The [[Serbo-Croatian language]] is linguistically a single language, with several literary and spoken variants since the language of the government was imposed where other languages dominated ([[Socialist Republic of Slovenia|Slovenia]], [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]). Now, separate sociolinguistic standards exist for the [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] languages.\n\nRemembrance of the time of the joint state and its positive attributes is referred to as ''[[Yugonostalgia]]''.\nMany aspects of Yugonostalgia refer to the socialist system and the sense of social security it provided.

Of the many religions, Islam, Roman Catholicism, Judaism, and Protestantism, as well as various [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Orthodox]] faiths, composed the religions of Yugoslavia, comprising over 40 in all. The religious demographics of Yugoslavia changed dramatically since World War II. A census taken in 1921 and later in 1948 show that 99% of the population appeared to be deeply involved with their religion and practices. With postwar government programs of modernisation and urbanisation, the percentage of religious believers took a dramatic plunge. Connections between religious belief and nationality posed a serious threat to the post-war Communist government's policies on national unity and state structure.<ref name=\"atheism.about.com\">{{cite web |url=http://atheism.about.com/library/world/KZ/bl_YugoReligionDemography.htm |title=Yugoslavia \u2013 Religious Demographics |publisher=Atheism.about.com |date=2009-12-16 |accessdate=2013-04-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424102013/http://atheism.about.com/library/world/KZ/bl_YugoReligionDemography.htm |archive-date=24 April 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAfter the rise of communism, a survey taken in 1964 showed that just over 70% of the total population of Yugoslavia considered themselves to be religious believers.

The places of lowest religious concentration were [[Slovenia]] 65.4%, [[Serbia]] with 63.7% and [[Croatia]] with 63.6%.

As a parliamentary party participating in legislative elections, the NSB had some success during the 1930s. It remained the only legal party in the Netherlands during most of the [[Netherlands in World War II|Second World War]].\n\n==Party history==\n===1931\u20131940===\nThe NSB was founded in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] in 1931 during a period when several [[nationalist]], fascist and national socialist parties were founded. The founders were [[Anton Mussert]], who became the party's leader, and [[Cornelis van Geelkerken]]. The party based its program on Italian fascism and German national socialism: however, unlike the latter, before 1936 the party was not [[anti-semitism|anti-semitic]] and even had Jewish members.\n\nIn 1933, after a year of building an organization, the party organized its first public meeting, a ''[[Landtag|Landdag]]'' in Utrecht which was attended by 600 party militants. Here the party presented itself. After that, the party's support began to grow. In the same year, the government forbade civil servants to be members.\n\nIn the provincial elections of 1935, the party gained eight percent of the votes and two seats in the [[Senate of the Netherlands|Senate]]. This was achieved against the background of the economic hardship of the [[Great Depression]]. Mussert's image as a reliable politician and his pragmatism allowed him to unite the different types of fascism and contributed to the party's success. This was bolstered by the party's strong organization and its political strategy, which was not oriented towards revolution but a democratic and legal take over of the country. By 1936, the party was holding annual mass meetings near [[Lunteren]] in Gelderland and, in 1938, it built the [[Muur van Mussert]] there, a wall which was supposed to be one element in a set of buildings and monuments inspired by the [[Nazi party rally grounds]] in [[Nuremberg]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cult.tpo.nl/2015/12/03/mini-docu-de-muur-van-mussert/|title=Mini-docu: De Muur van Mussert|last=Paternotte|first=Bas|date=3 December 2015|publisher=ThePostOnline|language=Dutch|accessdate=6 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1936, under the influence of [[Meinoud Rost van Tonningen]], the party became openly anti-semitic. Rost van Tonningen began to question Mussert's leadership, with the support of the German [[Nazi Party]], increasing divisions within the party. This led to decreased support for the party and a strong [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] reaction of the political parties, trade unions and churches. In the [[Dutch general election, 1937|1937 general elections]], the party gained only four percent of the votes and four seats in the [[House of Representatives of the Netherlands|House of Representatives]], although it increased its representation in the [[Senate of the Netherlands|Senate]] to five seats. In parliament, the NSB MPs showed little respect for parliamentary procedures and rules. Many NSB MPs were called to order by the chairman of parliament for physical and verbal violence. In the provincial election of 1939, the party also gained four percent of the votes.\n\n===1940\u20131945===\nAfter the [[Second World War]] broke out, the NSB sympathized with the Germans and advocated strict neutrality for the Netherlands. In May 1940, 800 NSB members and sympathizers were put in custody by the Dutch government,<ref>Jong 1956, p73.</ref> after the German invasion. Soon after the [[Battle of the Netherlands|Dutch defeat]] on 14 May 1940, they were set free by German troops. In June 1940, Mussert delivered a speech in [[Lunteren]] in which he called for the Netherlands to embrace the Germans and renounce the [[Dutch Monarchy]], which had fled to London.\n\nIn 1940 the [[Netherlands in World War II|German occupation]] government had outlawed all socialist and communist parties; in 1941 it forbade all parties, except for the NSB. The NSB openly collaborated with the occupation forces. Its membership grew to about 100,000. The NSB played an important role in lower government and civil service; every new mayor appointed by the German occupation government was a member of the NSB. On the national level, Mussert had expected he would be made leader of an independent Dutch state allied to Germany; in reality, however, the Austrian national socialist [[Arthur Seyss-Inquart]] was in charge of an occupation government. Mussert had several meetings with [[Adolf Hitler]] in which he pleaded for an independent Netherlands, but he was unsuccessful. Although Seyss-Inquart had proposed that Mussert should be made [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands]], he was only given the honorary title 'Leader of the Dutch People', and he was allowed to build a marginal State Secretariat, but he was given little or no actual power. His influence in the party waned at the expense of Rost van Tonningen and other more pro-German members. Beginning in the summer of 1943, many male members of the NSB were organized in the [[34th SS Volunteer Grenadier Division Landstorm Nederland|Landwacht]], which helped the government control the population.\n\nOn 4 September 1944, the Allied forces conquered [[Antwerp]] and the NSB expected the fall of the Netherlands to come soon. On 5 September, most of the NSB's leadership fled to Germany and the party's organization fell apart, on what is known as ''Dolle Dinsdag'' (Mad Tuesday).\n\nAfter the [[German Instrument of Surrender|German surrender on 6 May 1945]], the NSB was outlawed. Mussert was arrested the following day. Many of the members of the NSB were arrested, but only a few were convicted. Mussert was executed on 7 May 1946.\n\nThere were no attempts to continue the organization illegally.\n[[File:WWII Dutch NSB cap.jpg|thumb|Dutch WWII NSB (Nationaal-Socialistische Beweging ) cap]]\n[[File:WWII Dutch NSB armband.jpg|thumb|WWII Dutch NSB (Nationaal-Socialistische Beweging ) armband]]\n\n{{Nazism sidebar}}\n\n==Ideology and issues==\nThe NSB started out as a classical fascist party, which based itself on the principles of [[F\u00fchrerprinzip|leadership]]. It wanted a fascist state with a compliant government, fascist order and state control. It put the \"national interest\" above the individual interest and the interest of social groups, ([[pillarization|pillars]]) that had characterized Dutch society.

As a parliamentary party participating in legislative elections, the NSB had some success during the 1930s. It remained the only legal party in the Netherlands during most of the [[Netherlands in World War II|Second World War]].\n\n==Party history==\n===1931\u20131940===\nThe NSB was founded in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] in 1931 during a period when several [[nationalist]], fascist and national socialist parties were founded. The founders were [[Anton Mussert]], who became the party's leader, and [[Cornelis van Geelkerken]]. The party based its program on Italian fascism and German national socialism, however unlike the latter before 1936 the party was not [[anti-semitism|anti-semitic]] and even had Jewish members.\n\nIn 1933, after a year of building an organization, the party organized its first public meeting, a ''[[Landtag|Landdag]]'' in Utrecht which was attended by 600 party militants. Here the party presented itself. After that the party's support began to grow. In the same year the government forbade civil servants to be members of the NSB.\n\nIn the provincial elections of 1935 the party gained 8 percent of the votes and two seats in the [[Senate of the Netherlands|Senate]]. This result was achieved against the background of the economic hardship of the [[Great Depression]]. Mussert's image as a reliable politician and his pragmatism allowed him to unite the different types of fascism and contributed to the party's success. This was bolstered by the party's strong organization and its political strategy, which was not oriented towards violent revolution but a democratic legal take over of the country. By 1936 the party had begun holding annual mass meetings near [[Lunteren]] in Gelderland, and in 1938 it built the [[Muur van Mussert]] there, a wall which was supposed to be one element in a set of buildings and monuments inspired by the [[Nazi party rally grounds]] in [[Nuremberg]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cult.tpo.nl/2015/12/03/mini-docu-de-muur-van-mussert/|title=Mini-docu: De Muur van Mussert|last=Paternotte|first=Bas|date=3 December 2015|publisher=ThePostOnline|language=Dutch|accessdate=6 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1936, under influence of [[Meinoud Rost van Tonningen]] the party became openly anti-semitic. Rost van Tonningen began to question Mussert's leadership with support of the German [[Nazi Party]], raising internal divisions within the party. This led to decreased support for the party and a strong [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] reaction of the political parties, trade unions and churches. In the [[Dutch general election, 1937|1937 general elections]] the party gained only 4 percent of the votes and four seats in the [[House of Representatives of the Netherlands|House of Representatives]], however it increased its representation in the [[Senate of the Netherlands|Senate]] to five seats. In parliament the NSB MPs showed little respect for parliamentary procedures and rules. Many NSB MPs were called to order by the chairman of parliament for physical and verbal violence. In the provincial election of 1939 the party also gained 4 percent of the votes.\n\n===1940\u20131945===\nAfter the [[Second World War]] broke out, the NSB sympathized with the Germans and advocated strict neutrality for the Netherlands. In May 1940, 800 NSB members and sympathizers were put in custody by the Dutch government,<ref>Jong 1956, p73.</ref> after the German invasion. Soon after the [[Battle of the Netherlands|Dutch defeat]] on 14 May 1940, they were set free by German troops. In June 1940, Mussert delivered a speech in [[Lunteren]] in which he called for the Netherlands to embrace the Germans and renounce the [[Dutch Monarchy]], which had fled to London.\n\nIn 1940 the [[Netherlands in World War II|German occupation]] government had outlawed all socialist and communist parties; in 1941 it forbade all parties, except for the NSB. The NSB openly collaborated with the occupation forces. Its membership grew to about 100,000. The NSB played an important role in lower government and civil service; every new mayor appointed by the German occupation government was a member of the NSB. On the national level, Mussert had expected he would be made leader of an independent Dutch state allied to Germany; in reality, however, the Austrian national socialist [[Arthur Seyss-Inquart]] was in charge of an occupation government. Mussert had several meetings with [[Adolf Hitler]] in which he pleaded for an independent Netherlands, but he was unsuccessful. Although Seyss-Inquart had proposed that Mussert should be made [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands]], he was only given the honorary title 'Leader of the Dutch People', and he was allowed to build a marginal State Secretariat, but he was given little or no actual power. His influence in the party waned at the expense of Rost van Tonningen and other more pro-German members. Beginning in the summer of 1943, many male members of the NSB were organized in the [[34th SS Volunteer Grenadier Division Landstorm Nederland|Landwacht]], which helped the government control the population.\n\nOn 4 September 1944, the Allied forces conquered [[Antwerp]] and the NSB expected the fall of the Netherlands to come soon. On 5 September, most of the NSB's leadership fled to Germany and the party's organization fell apart, on what is known as ''Dolle Dinsdag'' (Mad Tuesday).\n\nAfter the [[German Instrument of Surrender|German surrender on 6 May 1945]], the NSB was outlawed. Mussert was arrested the following day. Many of the members of the NSB were arrested, but only a few were convicted. Mussert was executed on 7 May 1946.\n\nThere were no attempts to continue the organization illegally.\n[[File:WWII Dutch NSB cap.jpg|thumb|Dutch WWII NSB (Nationaal-Socialistische Beweging ) cap]]\n[[File:WWII Dutch NSB armband.jpg|thumb|WWII Dutch NSB (Nationaal-Socialistische Beweging ) armband]]\n\n{{Nazism sidebar}}\n\n==Ideology and issues==\nThe NSB started out as a classical fascist party, which based itself on the principles of [[F\u00fchrerprinzip|leadership]]. It wanted a fascist state with a compliant government, fascist order and state control. It put the \"national interest\" above the individual interest and the interest of social groups, ([[pillarization|pillars]]) that had characterized Dutch society. The party was anti-parliamentary and authoritarian. Its program, which was modeled on the program of the German Nazi Party, lacked reference to [[anti-semitism|anti-semitic]] or [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|racist ideology]] of the Nazi Party. After 1936, under the influence of [[Meinoud Rost van Tonningen]], the party became more oriented towards the Nazi Party and took over its anti-semitic and racist ideas.

Between 1931 and 1935 the party had its own paramilitary organization, the black uniformed ''[[Weerbaarheidsafdeling]]'' (WA), similar to the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' of the Nazi Party. It was refounded in 1940.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2021622/detail_no_jsp_action_detail_imid_78393.html|title=De WA (Weerbaarheidsafdeling) van de NSB|work=[[Europeana]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=8 September 2014}}</ref>  It also founded its own youth organization, ''[[Nationale Jeugdstorm]]'' (Youthstorm); a farmers' organization; and a daily newspaper, ''Het Nationale Dagblad'' (The National Daily).\n\nIn 1940 the NSB formed the [[Nederlandsche SS]] (Dutch SS), it had up to 7,000 members.\n\nThe term \"NSB'er\" has become synonymous with traitor in the Netherlands, and is used as an insult, especially in the context of ratting somebody out to authorities.\n\nA grim joke after World War II, made by Dutch Resistance fighters, is that former NSB members insisted that their acronym actually stood for \"Niet So [zo] Bedoeld\" or \"I didn't mean it\" as they attempted to downplay their treachery.\n\n<gallery>\nNSBUtrecht1941.jpg|NSB Meeting (Utrecht 1941)\nNSB1941.jpg|NSB Meeting<br />(The Hague 1941)\nNSBHouZeeDenHaag1941.jpg|HouZee<br />(The Hague 1941)\n</gallery>\n\n===Relationships to other parties===\nThe NSB was methodically isolated by other parties.

It lies close to the capital city Bucharest and it had close connections with the capital city throughout the centuries. Ploie\u0219ti lies at the 25\u00b0E meridian and the 44\u00b055\u2019N parallel (north). The city occupies a total surface of around 60&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, out of which 35&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> is suburban settlements. There exist two rivers in the proximity of the city: [[Prahova river]], on the south-west, briefly passes through the city through the [[Brazi]] settlement and [[Teleajen River]] passes through the [[Blejoi]], [[Bucov]], [[Berceni, Bucharest|Berceni]] villages. The city lies on [[D\u00e2mbu River]], which springs from the hills around the [[B\u0103icoi]] town. Nowadays the [[D\u00e2mbu River]] doesn't have a high flow rate.\n\n=== Nearest towns ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n! rowspan=2 valign=top | Town \n! rowspan=2 valign=top align=right| Direction \n! colspan=3 | Distance\n|-\n! straight-line distance\n! road distance\n! rail distance\n|-\n|[[Bucharest]] || S || 56&nbsp;km || 60&nbsp;km || 59&nbsp;km\n|-\n|[[Br\u0103ila]] || E || 155&nbsp;km || 170&nbsp;km || 176&nbsp;km\n|-\n|[[Pite\u0219ti]] || W || 91&nbsp;km || 111&nbsp;km || 149&nbsp;km\n|-\n|[[Bra\u0219ov]] || NW || 86&nbsp;km || 114&nbsp;km || 110&nbsp;km\n|-\n|[[T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te]] || V || 46&nbsp;km || 51&nbsp;km || 52&nbsp;km\n|-\n|[[Buz\u0103u]] || NE || 66&nbsp;km || 71&nbsp;km || 69&nbsp;km\n|-\n|[[Urziceni]] || SE || 55&nbsp;km ||60&nbsp;km || 55&nbsp;km\n|}\n\n===Climate===\nThe climate is similar to that of the nation's capital, [[Bucharest]].  According to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], the city falls within the temperate [[humid continental climate]](Dfa) of the hot summer type. The average annual temperature is 10.5&nbsp;\u00b0C, with record minimum registered on 25 January 1952 of -30&nbsp;\u00b0C while record maximum was registered on 19 July 2007 of 43&nbsp;\u00b0C. On average, around 17 days are very cold, 26 cold, 99 warm and 30 tropical, while the rest have a moderate temperature.\n\nAverage annual precipitations are 600&nbsp;mm; 30\u201340&nbsp;mm in January and 88&nbsp;mm in June. Precipitations range between 963.9&nbsp;mm registered in 1901 and 305.3&nbsp;mm registered in 1930. Throughout the year, there are on average 104 days with rain, 26 with snow, 112 with clear skies, 131 with clouds and 122 with no sunshine. The climate of Ploie\u0219ti is influenced by the winds coming from north-east (40%) and south-east (23%), having an average speed of 3.1&nbsp;m/s. On average, there are 11 days throughout the year with wind speed exceeding 11&nbsp;m/s and only 2 days characterised by winds over 16&nbsp;m/s.

The surrounding landscape is influenced by its position around the Prahova river, whose stream bed lies 25&nbsp;km west. The [[Teleajen River]] passes through the city while the [[D\u00e2mbu River]] passes through the north-eastern neighbourhoods.\n\nThe vegetation of Ploie\u0219ti used to be characterised by a plain forest, made up predominantly of pedunculate oak trees (''[[Quercus robur]]''). Other varieties of oak trees such as the sessile oak (''[[Quercus petraea]]'') also existed. Remnants of the old forest still exist and some trees are currently protected, such as two old oak trees in [[B\u0103rc\u0103ne\u0219ti, Prahova|Ghighiu]], on the southern periphery of the city.\n\nIn current times the vegetation is typical of urban settlements, made up of ornamental plants, plantations of [[chestnuts]], [[Populus tremula|aspen]] and [[black locust]]. Parks and other green areas are limited: the main boulevard area, the park next to the Sala Sporturilor, the park from the northern part of the city, the \"Mihai Viteazul\" park and another park next to the Bucov barrier. These occupy only around 85.5 ha, resulting in 3.2 m2 of green space per inhabitant.\n\n[[File:Arteziana-ceas-1.jpg|thumb|200px|Central park]]\n\nAround the city one can also observe several endangered trees, which are protected by law. These include the giant redwood (''[[Sequoiadendron giganteum]]'') from the garden of the \"Paul Constantinescu\" museum. There also exist trees that have adapted to the local climate, such as [[Common fig|figs]]. In some neighbourhoods more fruit trees and flowers are currently being planted.\n\n==Politics==\nThe Ploie\u0219ti City Council, elected in the [[2016 Romanian local election|2016 local elections]], is made up of 27 councillors, with the following party composition:\n\n{| cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"background:#ccc\" | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n! style=\"background:#ccc\" | Party\n! style=\"background:#ccc\" | Seats\n! style=\"background:#ccc\" colspan=\"11\" | Current Council\n|-\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PSD}} |\n| [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social Democratic Party]]\n| style=\"text-align: right\" | '''11'''\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PSD}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PSD}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PSD}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PSD}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PSD}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PSD}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PSD}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PSD}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PSD}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PSD}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PSD}} | &nbsp;\n|-\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PNL}} |\n| [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party]]\n| style=\"text-align: right\" | '''10'''\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PNL}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PNL}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PNL}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PNL}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PNL}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PNL}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PNL}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PNL}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PNL}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PNL}} | &nbsp;\n|-\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/ALDE}} |\n| [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats (Romania)|Alliance of Liberals and Democrats]]\n| style=\"text-align: right\" | '''4'''\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/ALDE}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/ALDE}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/ALDE}} | &nbsp;\n|-\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PMP}} |\n| [[People's Movement Party]]\n| style=\"text-align: right\" | '''2'''\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PMP}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PMP}} | &nbsp;\n|-\n|}\n\nThere exist approximatively 88,104 flats that are located in 21,172 buildings. 93% of the households have access to clean water, 90% have access to the sewage network, 98% have access to electricity and 78% are connected to the district heating system.\n\n=== Metropolitan area ===\n[[File:Ploiesti Metropolitan Area 2009.jpg|thumb|300px|Ploie\u0219ti metropolitan area]]\n{{Main|Ploie\u0219ti metropolitan area}}\n\nThe metropolitan area of Ploie\u0219ti comprises 13 satellite towns.

It lies close to the capital city Bucharest and it had close connections with the capital city throughout the centuries. Ploie\u0219ti lies at the 25\u00b0E meridian and the 44\u00b055\u2019N parallel (north). The city occupies a total surface of around 60&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, out of which 35&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> is suburban settlements. There exist two rivers in the proximity of the city: [[Prahova river]], on the south-west, briefly passes through the city through the [[Brazi]] settlement and [[Teleajen River]] passes through the [[Blejoi]], [[Bucov]], [[Berceni, Bucharest|Berceni]] villages. The city lies on [[D\u00e2mbu River]], which springs from the hills around the [[B\u0103icoi]] town. Nowadays the [[D\u00e2mbu River]] doesn't have a high flow rate.\n\n=== Nearest towns ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n! rowspan=2 valign=top | Town \n! rowspan=2 valign=top align=right| Direction \n! colspan=3 | Distance\n|-\n! straight-line distance\n! road distance\n! rail distance\n|-\n|[[Bucharest]] || S || 56&nbsp;km || 60&nbsp;km || 59&nbsp;km\n|-\n|[[Br\u0103ila]] || E || 155&nbsp;km || 170&nbsp;km || 176&nbsp;km\n|-\n|[[Pite\u0219ti]] || W || 91&nbsp;km || 111&nbsp;km || 149&nbsp;km\n|-\n|[[Bra\u0219ov]] || NW || 86&nbsp;km || 114&nbsp;km || 110&nbsp;km\n|-\n|[[T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te]] || V || 46&nbsp;km || 51&nbsp;km || 52&nbsp;km\n|-\n|[[Buz\u0103u]] || NE || 66&nbsp;km || 71&nbsp;km || 69&nbsp;km\n|-\n|[[Urziceni]] || SE || 55&nbsp;km ||60&nbsp;km || 55&nbsp;km\n|}\n\n===Climate===\nThe climate is similar to that of the nation's capital, [[Bucharest]].  According to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], the city falls within the temperate [[humid continental climate]](Dfa) of the hot summer type. The average annual temperature is 10.5&nbsp;\u00b0C, with record minimum registered on 25 January 1952 of -30&nbsp;\u00b0C while record maximum was registered on 19 July 2007 of 43&nbsp;\u00b0C. On average, around 17 days are very cold, 26 cold, 99 warm and 30 tropical, while the rest have a moderate temperature.\n\nAverage annual precipitations are 600&nbsp;mm; 30\u201340&nbsp;mm in January and 88&nbsp;mm in June. Precipitations range between 963.9&nbsp;mm registered in 1901 and 305.3&nbsp;mm registered in 1930. Throughout the year, there are on average 104 days with rain, 26 with snow, 112 with clear skies, 131 with clouds and 122 with no sunshine. The climate of Ploie\u0219ti is influenced by the winds coming from north-east (40%) and south-east (23%), having an average speed of 3.1&nbsp;m/s. On average, there are 11 days throughout the year with wind speed exceeding 11&nbsp;m/s and only 2 days characterised by winds over 16&nbsp;m/s.

The surrounding landscape is influenced by its position around the Prahova river, whose stream bed lies 25&nbsp;km west. The [[Teleajen River]] passes through the city while the [[D\u00e2mbu River]] passes through the north-eastern neighbourhoods.\n\nThe vegetation of Ploie\u0219ti used to be characterised by a plain forest, made up predominantly of pedunculate oak trees (''[[Quercus robur]]''). Other varieties of oak trees such as the sessile oak (''[[Quercus petraea]]'') also existed. Remnants of the old forest still exist and some trees are currently protected, such as two old oak trees in [[B\u0103rc\u0103ne\u0219ti, Prahova|Ghighiu]], on the southern periphery of the city.\n\nIn current times the vegetation is typical of urban settlements, made up of ornamental plants, plantations of [[chestnuts]], [[Populus tremula|aspen]] and [[black locust]]. Parks and other green areas are limited: the main boulevard area, the park next to the Sala Sporturilor, the park from the northern part of the city, the \"Mihai Viteazul\" park and another park next to the Bucov barrier. These occupy only around 85.5 ha, resulting in 3.2 m2 of green space per inhabitant.\n\n[[File:Arteziana-ceas-1.jpg|thumb|200px|Central park]]\n\nAround the city one can also observe several endangered trees, which are protected by law. These include the giant redwood (''[[Sequoiadendron giganteum]]'') from the garden of the \"Paul Constantinescu\" museum. There also exist trees that have adapted to the local climate, such as [[Common fig|figs]]. In some neighbourhoods more fruit trees and flowers are currently being planted.\n\n==Politics==\nThe Ploie\u0219ti City Council, elected in the [[2016 Romanian local election|2016 local elections]], is made up of 27 councillors, with the following party composition:\n\n{| cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"background:#ccc\" | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n! style=\"background:#ccc\" | Party\n! style=\"background:#ccc\" | Seats\n! style=\"background:#ccc\" colspan=\"11\" | Current Council\n|-\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PSD}} |\n| [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social Democratic Party]]\n| style=\"text-align: right\" | '''11'''\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PSD}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PSD}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PSD}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PSD}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PSD}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PSD}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PSD}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PSD}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PSD}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PSD}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PSD}} | &nbsp;\n|-\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PNL}} |\n| [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party]]\n| style=\"text-align: right\" | '''10'''\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PNL}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PNL}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PNL}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PNL}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PNL}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PNL}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PNL}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PNL}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PNL}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PNL}} | &nbsp;\n|-\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/ALDE}} |\n| [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats (Romania)|Alliance of Liberals and Democrats]]\n| style=\"text-align: right\" | '''4'''\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/ALDE}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/ALDE}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/ALDE}} | &nbsp;\n|-\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PMP}} |\n| [[People's Movement Party]]\n| style=\"text-align: right\" | '''2'''\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PMP}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PMP}} | &nbsp;\n|-\n|}\n\nThere exist approximatively 88,104 flats that are located in 21,172 buildings. 93% of the households have access to clean water, 90% have access to the sewage network, 98% have access to electricity and 78% are connected to the district heating system.\n\n=== Metropolitan area ===\n[[File:Ploiesti Metropolitan Area 2009.jpg|thumb|300px|Ploie\u0219ti metropolitan area]]\n{{Main|Ploie\u0219ti metropolitan area}}\n\nThe metropolitan area of Ploie\u0219ti comprises 13 satellite towns.

The [[Turkic people|Turkic]] [[Kipchaks]] had followed the [[Tauri]]ans, [[Greeks in pre-Roman Crimea|Greeks]], [[Goths]], [[Huns]], [[Sarmatians]] and [[Scythians]] in Crimea. The [[Mongols]] who [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|invaded the Russian principalities]] under [[Batu Khan]], incorporated the Kipchaks of the south Ukrainian plains into their forces in the 1240s. This amalgam of Mongols and Kipchkaks, which gradually converted to Islam, became known as [[Tatars]].

The Tatars of Crimea and the neighbouring steppes continued their domination even with the decline of Mongol rule in the 1300s. The [[Great stand on the Ugra river|liberation of Russia]] from the [[Golden Horde]] in 1480 could not end their power either, and by this time the Tatar [[Giray dynasty]] had already established an independent [[khanate]] in Crimea and the neighbouring territory.
