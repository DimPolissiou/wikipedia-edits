The characters of [[Fred Flintstone]], [[Barney Rubble]] and [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] were only featured together during the opening title sequence and in brief bumpers between segments.<ref name=Daytime>{{cite book |last1=Hyatt |first1=Wesley |title=The Encyclopedia of Daytime Television |date=1997 |publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications |isbn=978-0823083152 |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofda00hyat/page/160/mode/2up|accessdate=19 March 2020|page=160}}</ref> The unusual combination of a Marvel superhero and ''The Flintstones'' was possible because, at this time, [[Marvel Comics]] owned the rights to several Hanna-Barbera franchises and were, in fact, publishing comic books based upon them; ''The Flintstones'' was one of these.\n\nFor the 1979\u201380 season, the series was expanded to a 90-minute timeslot with the addition of ''[[The New Shmoo]]'' episodes and broadcast under the new title '''''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Shmoo]]'''''.\n\nLike many animated series created by Hanna-Barbera in the 1970s, the show contained a [[Laugh track#Making their own|laugh track]], one of their last productions to do so.\n\n==The Thing==\nThe first segment, a very loose adaptation of [[Marvel Comics]]' character the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], consisted of stories following the adventures of a scrawny, red-headed teenager named Benjy Grimm (voiced by Wayne Morton)<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |page=210}}</ref> who changes into the monstrous and mighty Thing (voiced by Joe Baker) by touching together magic rings and reciting the words \"Thing ring, do your thing!\", releasing an explosion of energy that causes orange rocks to hurl in from every direction and transform him into the stone-skinned superhero. When the Thing spoke, his good-naturedly gruff [[Brooklyn]]-accented voice was based on that of comedian [[Jimmy Durante]].\n\nThe stories centered mostly around Benjy at Centerville High School with his friends, the beautiful brunette Betty Harkness (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]), her snooty rich boyfriend Ronald Radford (voiced by [[John Erwin]]), and Betty's blond [[tomboy]] younger sister Kelly (voiced by Noelle North), with minimal adult supervision provided by teacher Miss Twilly (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]). Only Kelly and her scientist father Dr. Harkness (voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]]) know Benjy's secret identity.\n\nWhen not battling various [[mad scientist]]s and getting involved in [[Scooby-Doo]]-style mysteries, the Thing spent most of his time using his superhuman strength to protect his pals from everyday dangers and the nasty [[practical joke]]s of leather-clad bully Spike (voiced by [[Art Metrano]]) and his biker buddies Stretch and Turkey in the [[Yancy Street Gang]].\n \nOther members of the [[Fantastic Four]] did not appear in the show, and the portrayal of the Thing and his origin story differed greatly from the original comics.<ref>{{cite news|title= Fantastic Four on TV|newspaper= [[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/797/797130p2.html|accessdate=September 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\nTwenty-six 11-minute episodes of ''The Thing'' were produced; two shorts aired per show.\n\n''The Thing'' segments are owned by [[WarnerMedia]], through [[Hanna-Barbera]], [[Warner Bros. Animation]] and [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment]], but the character is owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]] due to their purchase of Marvel Comics in late 2009.\n\n===Other appearances===\nIn ''[[Future Foundation|FF]]'' #8,

by [[Hanna-Barbera]] which aired on [[NBC]] from September 8, 1979 to December 1, 1979.<ref name=Woolery>{{cite book |last1=Woolery |first1=George W. |title=Children's Television: The First

(comics)|Thing]])\n\nDespite the show's title, the two segments remained separate and did not crossover with one another. The characters of [[Fred Flintstone]], [[Barney Rubble]] and [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] were only featured together during the opening title sequence and in brief bumpers between segments.<ref name=Daytime>{{cite book |last1=Hyatt |first1=Wesley |title=The Encyclopedia of Daytime Television |date=1997 |publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications |isbn=978-0823083152 |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofda00hyat/page/160/mode/2up|accessdate=19 March 2020|page=160}}</ref> The unusual combination of a Marvel superhero and ''The Flintstones'' was possible because, at this time, [[Marvel Comics]] owned the rights to several Hanna-Barbera franchises and were, in fact, publishing comic books based upon them; ''The Flintstones'' was one of these.\n\nFor the 1979\u201380 season, the series was expanded to a 90-minute timeslot with the addition of ''[[The New Shmoo]]'' episodes and broadcast under the new title '''''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Shmoo]]'''''.\n\nLike many animated series created by Hanna-Barbera in the 1970s, the show contained a [[Laugh track#Making their own|laugh track]], one of their last productions to do so.\n\n==The Thing==\nThe first segment, a very loose adaptation of [[Marvel Comics]]' character the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], consisted of stories following the adventures of a scrawny, red-headed teenager named Benjy Grimm (voiced by Wayne Morton)<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |page=210}}</ref> who changes into the monstrous and mighty Thing (voiced by Joe Baker) by touching together magic rings and reciting the words \"Thing ring, do your thing!\", releasing an explosion of energy that causes orange rocks to hurl in from every direction and transform him into the stone-skinned superhero. When the Thing spoke, his good-naturedly gruff [[Brooklyn]]-accented voice was based on that of comedian [[Jimmy Durante]].\n\nThe stories centered mostly around Benjy at Centerville High School with his friends, the beautiful brunette Betty Harkness (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]), her snooty rich boyfriend Ronald Radford (voiced by [[John Erwin]]), and Betty's blond [[tomboy]] younger sister Kelly (voiced by Noelle North), with minimal adult supervision provided by teacher Miss Twilly (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]). Only Kelly and her scientist father Dr. Harkness (voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]]) know Benjy's secret identity.\n\nWhen not battling various [[mad scientist]]s and getting involved in [[Scooby-Doo]]-style mysteries, the Thing spent most of his time using his superhuman strength to protect his pals from everyday dangers and the nasty [[practical joke]]s of leather-clad bully Spike (voiced by [[Art Metrano]]) and his biker buddies Stretch and Turkey in the [[Yancy Street Gang]].\n \nOther members of the [[Fantastic Four]] did not appear in the show, and the portrayal of the Thing and his origin story differed greatly from the original comics.<ref>{{cite news|title= Fantastic Four on TV|newspaper= [[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/797/797130p2.html|accessdate=September 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\nTwenty-six 11-minute episodes of ''The Thing'' were produced; two shorts aired per show.\n\n''The Thing'' segments are owned by [[WarnerMedia]], through [[Hanna-Barbera]], [[Warner Bros. Animation]] and [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment]], but the character is owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]] due to their purchase of Marvel Comics in late 2009.\n\n===Other appearances===\nIn ''[[Future Foundation|FF]]'' #8,

{"title_page": "Life insurance", "text_new": "'''[https://www.insurancetopguides.com/insurance/why-should-you-get-life-insurance/ Life insurance]''' (or '''life assurance''', especially in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]) is a contract between an [[insurance policy]] holder and an [[insurance|insurer or assurer]], where the insurer promises to pay a designated [[beneficiary]] a sum of money (the benefit) in exchange for a premium, upon the death of an insured person (often the policy holder). Depending on the contract, other events such as [[terminal illness]] or [[critical illness]] can also trigger payment. The policy holder typically pays a premium, either regularly or as one lump sum. Other expenses, such as funeral expenses, can also be included in the benefits. \n\nLife policies are legal contracts and the terms of the contract describe the limitations of the insured events. Specific exclusions are often written into the contract to limit the liability of the insurer; common examples are claims relating to suicide, fraud, war, riot, and civil commotion.\n\nModern life insurance bears some similarity to the [[asset management]] industry<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.investopedia.com/features/industryhandbook/insurance.asp|title=The Industry Handbook: The Insurance Industry|date=2004-01-07|work=Investopedia|access-date=2018-11-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180907000042/https://www.investopedia.com/features/industryhandbook/insurance.asp|archive-date=2018-09-07|url-status=live|language=en-US}}</ref> and life insurers have diversified their products into retirement products such as [[Annuity (American)|annuities]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.valueline.com/Stocks/Industries/Industry_Overview__Life_Insurance.aspx#.W_4wr5NKiAx|title=Industry Overview: Life Insurance|website=www.valueline.com|publisher=[[ValueLine]]|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}</ref> \n\n<u>Life-based contracts tend to fall into two major categories:</u>\n\n* Protection policies: designed to provide a benefit, typically a lump sum payment, in the event of a specified occurrence.

The [[Presbyterianism in the United States|Presbyterian]] Synods in [[Synod of Philadelphia|Philadelphia]] and [[Synod of New York|New York City]] created the Corporation for Relief of Poor and Distressed Widows and Children of Presbyterian Ministers in 1759; [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]] priests organized a similar fund in 1769. Between 1787 and 1837 more than two dozen life insurance companies were started, but fewer than half a dozen survived. In the 1870s, military officers banded together to found both the Army ([[AAFMAA]]) and the [[Navy Mutual Aid Association]] (Navy Mutual), inspired by the plight of widows and orphans left stranded in the West after the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn|Battle of the Little Big Horn]], and of the families of U.S. sailors who died at sea.\n\n==Overview==\n\n===Parties to contract===\nThe person responsible for making payments for a policy is the policy owner, while the insured is the person whose death will trigger payment of the death benefit. The owner and insured may or may not be the same person. For example, if Joe buys a policy on his own life, he is both the owner and the insured. But if Jane, his wife, buys a policy on Joe's life, she is the owner and he is the insured. The policy owner is the guarantor and they will be the person to pay for the policy. The insured is a participant in the contract, but not necessarily a party to it.\n\n[[File:Chart of a life insurance.jpg|thumb|Chart of a life insurance]]\n\nThe beneficiary receives policy proceeds upon the insured person's death. The owner designates the beneficiary, but the beneficiary is not a party to the policy. The owner can change the beneficiary unless the policy has an irrevocable beneficiary designation. If a policy has an irrevocable beneficiary, any beneficiary changes, policy assignments, or cash value borrowing would require the agreement of the original beneficiary.\n\nIn cases where the policy owner is not the insured (also referred to as the ''celui qui vit'' or CQV), insurance companies have sought to limit policy purchases to those with an [[insurable interest]] in the CQV. For life insurance policies, close family members and business partners will usually be found to have an insurable interest. The insurable interest requirement usually demonstrates that the purchaser will actually suffer some kind of loss if the CQV dies. Such a requirement prevents people from benefiting from the purchase of purely speculative policies on people they expect to die. With no insurable interest requirement, the risk that a purchaser would murder the CQV for insurance proceeds would be great. In at least one case, an insurance company which sold a policy to a purchaser with no insurable interest (who later murdered the CQV for the proceeds), was found liable in court for contributing to the [[wrongful death]] of the victim (''Liberty National Life v. Weldon'', 267 Ala.171 (1957)).\n\n===Contract terms===\nSpecial exclusions may apply, such as suicide clauses, whereby the policy becomes null and void if the insured dies by [[suicide]] within a specified time (usually two years after the purchase date; some states provide a statutory one-year suicide clause). Any misrepresentations by the insured on the application may also be grounds for nullification. Most US states specify a maximum contestability period, often no more than two years. Only if the insured dies within this period will the insurer have a legal right to contest the claim on the basis of misrepresentation and request additional information before deciding whether to pay or deny the claim.\n\nThe face amount of the policy is the initial amount that the policy will pay at the death of the insured or when the policy [[Maturity (finance)|matures]], although the actual death benefit can provide for greater or lesser than the face amount. The policy matures when the insured dies or reaches a specified age (such as 100 years old).\n\n===Costs, insurability, and underwriting===\nThe insurance company calculates the policy prices (premiums) at a level sufficient to fund claims, cover administrative costs, and provide a profit. The cost of insurance is determined using mortality tables calculated by [[actuary|actuaries]]. Mortality tables are statistically based tables showing expected annual mortality rates of people at different ages. Put simply, people are more likely to die as they get older and the mortality tables enable the insurance companies to calculate the risk and increase premiums with age accordingly. Such estimates can be important in taxation regulation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement/article/0,,id=103045,00.html#12|title=IRS Retirement Plans FAQs regarding Revenue Ruling 2002-62|website=irs.gov|accessdate=14 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120808064248/http://www.irs.gov/retirement/article/0,,id=103045,00.html#12|archivedate=8 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-irbs/irb02-42.pdf|title=IRS Bulletin No. 2002\u201342|website=irs.gov|accessdate=14 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170502202442/https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-irbs/irb02-42.pdf|archivedate=2 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the SOA 1975-80 Basic Select & Ultimate tables were the typical reference points, while the 2001 VBT and 2001 CSO tables were published more recently.

At the end of 10 years, the mortality of that 25-year-old, non-smoking male is 0.66/1000/year. Consequently, in a group of one thousand 25-year-old males with a $100,000 policy, all of average health, a life insurance company would have to collect approximately $50 a year from each participant to cover the relatively few expected claims. (0.35 to 0.66 expected deaths in each year \u00d7 $100,000 payout per death = $35 per policy.) Other costs, such as administrative and sales expenses, also need to be considered when setting the premiums. A 10-year policy for a 25-year-old non-smoking male with preferred medical history may get offers as low as $90 per year for a $100,000 policy in the competitive US life insurance market.\n\nMost of the revenue received by insurance companies consists of premiums, but revenue from investing the premiums forms an important source of profit for most life insurance companies. [[Group Insurance]] policies are an exception to this.\n\nIn the United States, life insurance companies are never legally required to provide coverage to everyone, with the exception of [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]] compliance requirements. Insurance companies alone determine insurability, and some people are deemed uninsurable. The policy can be declined or rated (increasing the premium amount to compensate for the higher risk), and the amount of the premium will be proportional to the face value of the policy.\n\nMany companies separate applicants into four general categories. These categories are ''preferred best'', ''preferred'', ''standard'', and ''tobacco''. Preferred best is reserved only for the healthiest individuals in the general population. This may mean, that the proposed insured has no adverse medical history, is not under medication, and has no family history of early-onset [[cancer]], [[diabetes]], or other conditions.<ref>{{cite web|title=How do Insurance Rating Classifications Work?|url=http://seniorlifepolicies.com/how-do-insurance-rating-classifications-work/|accessdate=4 November 2011}}{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Preferred means that the proposed insured is currently under medication and has a family history of particular illnesses. Most people are in the standard category.\n\nPeople in the tobacco category typically have to pay higher premiums due to the higher mortality.

If the insured's death is suspicious and the policy amount is large, the insurer may investigate the circumstances surrounding the death before deciding whether it has an obligation to pay the claim.\n\nPayment from the policy may be as a lump sum or as an [[Annuity (financial contracts)|annuity]], which is paid in regular installments for either a specified period or [[Life annuity|for the beneficiary's lifetime]].<ref name=\"OECD2016\">{{cite book|author=OECD|title=Life Annuity Products and Their Guarantees|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9_GmDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA10|date=5 December 2016|publisher=OECD Publishing|isbn=978-92-64-26531-8|pages=10\u201313}}</ref>\n\n===Insurance vs assurance===\nThe specific uses of the terms \u201cinsurance\u201d and \u201cassurance\u201d are sometimes confused. In general, in jurisdictions where both terms are used, \u201cinsurance\u201d refers to providing coverage for an event that ''might'' happen (fire, theft, flood, etc.), while \u201cassurance\u201d is the provision of coverage for an event that is ''certain'' to happen. In the United States, both forms of coverage are called \u201cinsurance\u201d for reasons of simplicity in companies selling both products.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} By some definitions, \u201cinsurance\u201d is any coverage that determines benefits based on actual losses whereas \u201cassurance\u201d is coverage with predetermined benefits irrespective of the losses incurred.\n\nLife insurance may be divided into two basic classes: temporary and permanent; or the following subclasses: term, universal, [[Whole life insurance|whole life]], and endowment life insurance.\n\n===Term insurance===\n{{Main|Term life insurance}}\n\n[[Term assurance]] provides life insurance coverage for a specified term. The policy does not accumulate cash value. Term insurance is significantly less expensive than an equivalent permanent policy but will become higher with age. Policy holders can save to provide for increased term premiums or decrease insurance needs (by paying off debts or saving to provide for survivor needs).<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Black |first1=Kenneth, Jr. |last2=Skipper |first2=Harold D., Jr. |title=Life Insurance |edition=4th |year=1994 |page=94 |isbn=0135329957}}</ref>\n\n''[[Mortgage life insurance]]'' insures a loan secured by real property and usually features a level premium amount for a declining policy face value because what is insured is the principal and interest outstanding on a mortgage that is constantly being reduced by mortgage payments. The face amount of the policy is always the amount of the principal and interest outstanding that are paid should the applicant die before the final installment is paid.\n\n==== Group life insurance ====\n''Group life insurance'' (also known as ''wholesale life insurance'' or ''institutional life insurance'') is term insurance covering a group of people, usually employees of a company, members of a union or association, or members of a pension or [[superannuation]] fund. Individual proof of insurability is not normally a consideration in its underwriting. Rather, the underwriter considers the size, turnover, and financial strength of the group. Contract provisions will attempt to exclude the possibility of [[adverse selection]]. Group life insurance often allows members exiting the group to maintain their coverage by buying individual coverage. The underwriting is carried out for the whole group instead of individuals.\n\n===Permanent life insurance===\n''Permanent life insurance'' is life insurance that covers the remaining lifetime of the insured. A permanent insurance policy accumulates a [[cash value]] up to its date of maturation. The owner can access the money in the cash value by withdrawing money, borrowing the cash value, or surrendering the policy and receiving the surrender value.\n\nThe three basic types of permanent insurance are ''whole life'', ''universal life'', and ''endowment''.\n\n====Whole life====\n{{Main|Whole life insurance}}\nWhole life insurance provides lifetime coverage for a set premium amount (see main article for a full explanation of the many variations and options).\n\n====Universal life coverage====\n[[Universal life insurance]] (ULl) is a relatively new insurance product, intended to combine permanent insurance coverage with greater flexibility in premium payments, along with the potential for greater growth of cash values. There are several types of universal life insurance policies, including ''interest-sensitive'' (also known as \u201ctraditional fixed universal life insurance\u201d), ''variable universal life (VUL)'', ''guaranteed death benefit'', and has ''equity-indexed universal life insurance''.\n\nUniversal life insurance policies have cash values. Paid-in premiums increase their cash values; administrative and other costs reduce their cash values.\n\nUniversal life insurance addresses the perceived disadvantages of whole life\u2014namely that premiums and death benefits are fixed. With universal life, both the premiums and death benefit are flexible. With the exception of guaranteed-death-benefit universal life policies, universal life policies trade their greater flexibility off for fewer guarantees.\n\n\u201cFlexible death benefit\u201d means the policy owner can choose to decrease the death benefit. The death benefit can also be increased by the policy owner, usually requiring new underwriting. Another feature of flexible death benefit is the ability to choose option A or option B death benefits and to change those options over the course of the life of the insured. Option A is often referred to as a \"level death benefit\"; death benefits remain level for the life of the insured, and premiums are lower than policies with Option B death benefits, which pay the policy's cash value\u2014i.e., a face amount plus earnings/interest. If the cash value grows over time, the death benefits do too. If the cash value declines, the death benefit also declines. Option B policies normally feature higher premiums than option A policies.\n\n====Endowments====\n{{main|Endowment policy}}\nThe endowment policy is a life insurance contract designed to pay a lump sum after a specific term (on its 'maturity') or on death. Typical maturities are ten, fifteen or twenty years up to a certain age limit. Some policies also pay out in the case of critical illness.\n\nPolicies are typically traditional with-profits or unit-linked (including those with unitized with-profits funds).\n\nEndowments can be cashed in early (or surrendered) and the holder then receives the surrender value which is determined by the insurance company depending on how long the policy has been running and how much has been paid into it.\n\n====Accidental death====\nAccidental death insurance is a type of limited life insurance that is designed to cover the insured should they die as the result of an accident. \u201cAccidents\u201d run the gamut from abrasions to catastrophes but normally do not include deaths resulting from non-accident-related health problems or suicide. Because they only cover accidents, these policies are much less expensive than other life insurance policies.\n\nSuch insurance can also be ''[[accidental death and dismemberment insurance]]'' or ''AD&D''. In an AD&D policy, benefits are available not only for accidental death but also for the loss of limbs or body functions such as sight and hearing.\n\nAccidental death and AD&D policies ''very rarely pay'' a benefit, either because the cause of death is not covered by the policy or because death occurs well after the accident, by which time the premiums have gone unpaid. To know what coverage they have, insureds should always review their policies. Risky activities such as parachuting, flying, professional sports, or military service are often omitted from coverage.\n\nAccidental death insurance can also supplement standard life insurance as a [[rider (contract)|rider]]. If a rider is purchased, the policy generally pays double the face amount if the insured dies from an accident. This was once called ''[[double indemnity (insurance)|double indemnity]] insurance''. In some cases, triple indemnity coverage may be available.\n\n==== Senior and pre-need products ====\nInsurance companies have in recent years developed products for niche markets, most notably targeting seniors in an ageing population. These are often low to moderate face value whole life insurance policies, allowing senior citizens to purchase affordable insurance later in life. This may also be marketed as ''final expense insurance'' and usually have death benefits between $2,000 and $40,000. One reason for their popularity is that they only require answers to simple \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d questions, while most policies require a medical exam to qualify. As with other policy types, the range of premiums can vary widely and should be scrutinized prior to purchase, as should the reliability of the companies.\n\nHealth questions can vary substantially between exam and no-exam policies. It may be possible for individuals with certain conditions to qualify for one type of coverage and not another.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}  Because seniors sometimes are not fully aware of the policy provisions it is important to make sure that policies last for a lifetime and that premiums do not increase every 5 years as is common in some circumstances.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n''Pre-need life insurance policies'' are limited premium payment, whole life policies that are usually purchased by older applicants, though they are available to everyone. This type of insurance is designed to cover specific [[funeral]] expenses that the applicant has designated in a contract with a [[funeral home]]. The policy's death benefit is initially based on the funeral cost at the time of prearrangement, and it then typically grows as interest is credited. In exchange for the policy owner's designation, the funeral home typically guarantees that the proceeds will cover the cost of the funeral, no matter when death occurs. Excess proceeds may go either to the insured's estate, a designated beneficiary, or the funeral home as set forth in the contract. Purchasers of these policies usually make a single premium payment at the time of prearrangement, but some companies also allow premiums to be paid over as much as ten years.\n\n==Related products==\n''Riders'' are modifications to the insurance policy added at the same time the policy is issued. These riders change the basic policy to provide some feature desired by the policy owner. A common rider is ''accidental death'' (see above). Another common rider is a ''premium waiver'', which waives future premiums if the insured becomes disabled.\n\n''Joint life insurance'' is either term or permanent life insurance that insures two or more persons, with proceeds payable on the death of ''either''.\n\n===Unit Linked Insurance Plans===\n{{Main|Unit-linked insurance plan}}\nThese are unique insurance plans which are basically a mutual fund and term insurance plan rolled into one. The investor doesn't participate in the profits of the plan per se, but gets returns based on the returns on the funds he or she had chosen.\n\nSee the main article for a full explanation of the various features and variations.\n\n===With-profits policies===\n{{Main|With-profits policy}}\nSome policies afford the policyholder a share of the profits of the insurance company\u2014these are termed [[with-profits policy|with-profits policies]]. Other policies provide no rights to a share of the profits of the company\u2014these are ''non-profit'' policies.\n\nWith-profits policies are used as a form of [[collective investment scheme]] to achieve capital growth. Other policies offer a guaranteed return not dependent on the company's underlying investment performance; these are often referred to as ''without-profit'' policies, which may be construed as a misnomer.\n\n==Taxation==\n\n=== India ===\nAccording to the section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (of Indian penal code) premiums paid towards a valid life insurance policy can be exempted from the taxable income. Along with life insurance premium, section 80C allows exemption for other financial instruments such as Employee Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS), National Savings Certificate (NSC), health insurance premium are some of them. The total amount that can be exempted from the taxable income for section 80C is capped at a maximum of INR 150,000.<ref>{{cite web |title=Section - 80C, Income-tax Act, 1961-2018:B.\u2014Deductions in respect of certain payments |url=https://www.incometaxindia.gov.in/pages/acts/income-tax-act.aspx |website=Income Tax India |accessdate=6 November 2018}}</ref> The exemptions are eligible for individuals (Indian citizens) or Hindu Undivided Family (HUF).\n\n===Australia===\nWhere the life insurance is provided through a superannuation fund, contributions made to fund insurance premiums are tax deductible for self-employed persons and substantially self-employed persons and employers. However where life insurance is held outside of the superannuation environment, the premiums are generally not tax deductible. For insurance through a superannuation fund, the annual deductible contributions to the superannuation funds are subject to age limits. These limits apply to employers making deductible contributions. They also apply to self-employed persons and substantially self-employed persons. Included in these overall limits are insurance premiums. This means that no additional deductible contributions can be made for the funding of insurance premiums. Insurance premiums can, however, be funded by undeducted contributions. For further information on deductible contributions see \u201cunder what conditions can an employer claim a deduction for contributions made on behalf of their employees?\u201d and \u201cwhat is the definition of substantially self-employed?\u201d. The insurance premium paid by the superannuation fund can be claimed by the fund as a deduction to reduce the 15% tax on contributions and earnings. (Ref: ITAA 1936, Section 279).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://law.ato.gov.au/atolaw/view.htm?docid=%22AID%2FAID201076%2F00001%22 |title=ITAA 1936, Section 279 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828093936/http://law.ato.gov.au/atolaw/view.htm?docid=%22AID%2FAID201076%2F00001%22 |archivedate=2011-08-28 }}</ref>\n\n===South Africa===\nPremiums paid by a [[policyholder]] are not deductible from taxable income, although premiums paid via an approved [[pension fund]] registered in terms of the Income Tax Act are permitted to be deducted from personal income tax (whether these premiums are nominally being paid by the employer or employee). The benefits arising from life assurance policies are generally not taxable as income to beneficiaries (again in the case of approved benefits, these fall under retirement or withdrawal taxation rules from [[South African Revenue Service|SARS]]). Investment return within the policy will be taxed within the life policy and paid by the life assurer depending on the nature of the policyholder (whether natural person, company-owned, untaxed or a retirement fund).\n\n===United States===\nPremiums paid by the policy owner are normally not deductible for federal and state [[income tax]] purposes, and proceeds paid by the insurer upon the death of the insured are not included in gross income for federal and state income tax purposes.<ref>Internal Revenue Code \u00a7 101(a)(1)</ref> However, if the proceeds are included in the \"estate\" of the deceased, it is likely they will be subject to federal and state [[Estate tax (United States)|estate and inheritance tax]].\n\nCash value increases within the policy are not subject to income taxes unless certain events occur. For this reason, insurance policies can be a legal and legitimate [[tax shelter]] wherein savings can increase without taxation until the owner withdraws the money from the policy. In flexible-premium policies, large deposits of premium could cause the contract to be considered a ''modified endowment contract'' by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS), which negates many of the tax advantages associated with life insurance. The insurance company, in most cases, will inform the policy owner of this danger before deciding their premium.\n\nThe tax ramifications of life insurance are complex. The policy owner would be well advised to carefully consider them. As always, both the [[United States Congress]] and state legislatures can change the tax laws at any time.\n\nIn 2018, a [[fiduciary]] standard rule on retirement products by the [[United States Department of Labor]] posed a possible risk.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/financial-services/articles/insurance-industry-outlook.html|title=2018 Insurance Industry Outlook {{!}} Deloitte US|website=Deloitte United States|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\nPremiums are not usually deductible against income tax or [[corporation tax]], however qualifying policies issued prior to 14 March 1984 do still attract LAPR ([[Life Assurance Premium Relief]]) at 15% (with the net premium being collected from the policyholder).\n\nNon-investment life policies do not normally attract either income tax or [[capital gains tax]] on a claim. If the policy has as investment element such as an endowment policy, whole of life policy or an investment bond then the tax treatment is determined by the qualifying status of the policy.\n\nQualifying status is determined at the outset of the policy if the contract meets certain criteria. Essentially, long term contracts (10+ years) tend to be qualifying policies and the proceeds are free from income tax and capital gains tax. Single premium contracts and those running for a short term are subject to income tax depending upon the marginal rate in the year a gain is made. All UK insurers pay a special rate of corporation tax on the profits from their life book; this is deemed as meeting the lower rate (20% in 2005-06) of liability for policyholders. Therefore, a policyholder who is a higher-rate taxpayer (40% in 2005-06), or becomes one through the transaction, must pay tax on the gain at the difference between the higher and the lower rate. This gain is reduced by applying a calculation called [[top-slicing]] based on the number of years the policy has been held. Although this is complicated, the taxation of life assurance-based investment contracts may be beneficial compared to alternative equity-based collective investment schemes ([[unit trust]]s, [[investment trust]]s and [[Open-ended investment company|OEICs]]). One feature which especially favors investment bonds is the \u201c5% cumulative allowance\u201d\u2014the ability to draw 5% of the original investment amount each policy year without being subject to any taxation on the amount withdrawn. If not used in one year, the 5% allowance can roll over into future years, subject to a maximum tax-deferred withdrawal of 100% of the premiums payable. The withdrawal is deemed by the [[HMRC]] (Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs) to be a payment of capital and therefore, the tax liability is deferred until maturity or surrender of the policy. This is an especially useful [[tax planning]] tool for higher rate taxpayers who expect to become basic rate taxpayers at some predictable point in the future, as at this point the deferred tax liability will not result in tax being due.\n\nThe proceeds of a life policy will be included in the estate for [[death duty]] (in the UK, [[inheritance tax]]) purposes. Policies written in [[Trust law|trust]] may fall outside the estate. Trust law and taxation of trusts can be complicated, so any individual intending to use trusts for tax planning would usually seek professional advice from an [[independent financial adviser]] and/or a [[solicitor]].\n\n====Pension term assurance====\nAlthough available before April 2006, from this date [[pension term assurance]] became widely available in the UK. Most UK insurers adopted the name \"life insurance with tax relief\" for the product. Pension term assurance is effectively normal term life assurance with tax relief on the premiums. All premiums are paid at a net of basic rate tax at 22%, and higher-rate tax payers can gain an extra 18% tax relief via their tax return. Although not suitable for all, PTA briefly became one of the most common forms of life assurance sold in the UK until, [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]] [[Gordon Brown]] announced the withdrawal of the scheme in his pre-budget announcement on 6 December 2006.\n\n==Stranger originated==\n''Stranger-originated life insurance'' or [[Stranger-originated life insurance|STOLI]] is a life insurance policy that is held or financed by a person who has no relationship to the insured person. Generally, the purpose of life insurance is to provide peace of mind by assuring that financial loss or hardship will be alleviated in the event of the insured person's death. STOLI has often been used as an investment technique whereby investors will encourage someone (usually an elderly person) to purchase life insurance and name the investors as the beneficiary of the policy. This undermines the primary purpose of life insurance, as the investors would incur no financial loss should the insured person die. In some jurisdictions, there are laws to discourage or prevent STOLI.\n\n==Criticism==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2011}}\nAlthough some aspects of the application process (such as [[underwriting]] and insurable interest provisions) make it difficult, life insurance policies have been used to facilitate exploitation and [[ fraud]]. In the case of life insurance, there is a possible motive to purchase a life insurance policy, particularly if the face value is substantial, and then [[murder]] the insured. Usually, the larger the claim and/or the more serious the incident, the larger and more intense the ensuing investigation by police and insurer investigators.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insurancefraud.org/impact_statmnt.htm|title=Fraud: why should you worry?|first=dennis jay, jim quiggle, howard goldblatt, kendra smith, jennifer|last=tchinnosian|website=www.insurancefraud.org|accessdate=14 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113034803/http://www.insurancefraud.org/impact_statmnt.htm|archivedate=13 November 2012}}</ref> The [[television series]] ''[[Forensic Files]]'' has included episodes that feature this scenario. There was also a documented case in Los Angeles in 2006 where two elderly women were accused of taking in homeless men and assisting them. As part of their assistance, they took out life insurance for the men. After the contestability period ended on the policies, the women are alleged to have had the men killed via [[hit-and-run]] vehicular homicide.<ref>{{cite news |title=Two Elderly Women Indicted on Fraud Charges in Deaths of LA Hit-Run |publisher=Insurance Journal |date=June 1, 2006 |url=http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/west/2006/06/01/69022.htm |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104095818/http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/west/2006/06/01/69022.htm |archivedate=November 4, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nRecently, [[viatical settlement]]s have created problems for life insurance providers. A viatical settlement involves the purchase of a life insurance policy from an elderly or terminally ill policy holder. The policy holder sells the policy (including the right to name the beneficiary) to a purchaser for a price discounted from the policy value. The seller has cash in hand, and the purchaser will realize a [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] when the seller dies and the proceeds are delivered to the purchaser. In the meantime, the purchaser continues to pay the premiums. Although both parties have reached an agreeable settlement, insurers are troubled by this trend. Insurers calculate their rates with the assumption that a certain portion of policy holders will seek to redeem the cash value of their insurance policies before death. They also expect that a certain portion will stop paying premiums and forfeit their policies. However, viatical settlements ensure that such policies will with absolute certainty be paid out. Some purchasers, in order to take advantage of the potentially large profits, have even actively sought to collude with uninsured elderly and terminally ill patients, and created policies that would have not otherwise been purchased. These policies are guaranteed losses from the insurers' perspective.\n\nOn April 17, 2016, a report by [[Lesley Stahl]] on ''[[60 Minutes]]'' claimed that life insurance companies do not pay significant numbers of beneficiaries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-life-insurance-investigation-lesley-stahl/|title=Life insurance industry under investigation|website=cbsnews.com|accessdate=14 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208180314/https://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-life-insurance-investigation-lesley-stahl/|archivedate=8 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Corporate-owned life insurance]]\n* [[Critical illness insurance]]\n* [[Economic capital]]\n* [[Estate planning]]\n* [[False insurance claims]]\n* [[General insurance]]\n* [[Internal Revenue Code section 79]]\n* [[Life expectancy]]\n* [[Pet insurance]]\n* [[Retirement plan]]ning\n* [[Return of premium life insurance]]\n* [[Segregated fund]]s\n* [[Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance]]\n* [[Term life insurance]]\n* [[Tontine]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n===Specific references===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n=== General sources ===\n* {{cite book|author=Kutty, Shashidharan|title=Managing Life Insurance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yU58gTDHwoMC&pg=PT545 |date=12 August 2008|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt.

Depending on the contract, other events such as [[terminal illness]] or [[critical illness]] can also trigger payment. The policy holder typically pays a premium, either regularly or as one lump sum. Other expenses, such as funeral expenses, can also be included in the benefits. \n\nLife policies are legal contracts and the terms of the contract describe the limitations of the insured events.

The [[Presbyterianism in the United States|Presbyterian]] Synods in [[Synod of Philadelphia|Philadelphia]] and [[Synod of New York|New York City]] created the Corporation for Relief of Poor and Distressed Widows and Children of Presbyterian Ministers in 1759; [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]] priests organized a similar fund in 1769. Between 1787 and 1837 more than two dozen life insurance companies were started, but fewer than half a dozen survived. In the 1870s, military officers banded together to found both the Army ([[AAFMAA]]) and the [[Navy Mutual Aid Association]] (Navy Mutual), inspired by the plight of widows and orphans left stranded in the West after the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn|Battle of the Little Big Horn]], and of the families of U.S. sailors who died at sea.\n\n==Overview==\n\n===Parties to contract===\nThe person responsible for making payments for a policy is the policy owner, while the insured is the person whose death will trigger payment of the death benefit. The owner and insured may or may not be the same person. For example, if Joe buys a policy on his own life, he is both the owner and the insured. But if Jane, his wife, buys a policy on Joe's life, she is the owner and he is the insured. The policy owner is the guarantor and they will be the person to pay for the policy. The insured is a participant in the contract, but not necessarily a party to it.\n\n[[File:Chart of a life insurance.jpg|thumb|Chart of a life insurance]]\n\nThe beneficiary receives policy proceeds upon the insured person's death. The owner designates the beneficiary, but the beneficiary is not a party to the policy. The owner can change the beneficiary unless the policy has an irrevocable beneficiary designation. If a policy has an irrevocable beneficiary, any beneficiary changes, policy assignments, or cash value borrowing would require the agreement of the original beneficiary.\n\nIn cases where the policy owner is not the insured (also referred to as the ''celui qui vit'' or CQV), insurance companies have sought to limit policy purchases to those with an [[insurable interest]] in the CQV. For life insurance policies, close family members and business partners will usually be found to have an insurable interest. The insurable interest requirement usually demonstrates that the purchaser will actually suffer some kind of loss if the CQV dies. Such a requirement prevents people from benefiting from the purchase of purely speculative policies on people they expect to die. With no insurable interest requirement, the risk that a purchaser would murder the CQV for insurance proceeds would be great. In at least one case, an insurance company which sold a policy to a purchaser with no insurable interest (who later murdered the CQV for the proceeds), was found liable in court for contributing to the [[wrongful death]] of the victim (''Liberty National Life v. Weldon'', 267 Ala.171 (1957)).\n\n===Contract terms===\nSpecial exclusions may apply, such as suicide clauses, whereby the policy becomes null and void if the insured dies by [[suicide]] within a specified time (usually two years after the purchase date; some states provide a statutory one-year suicide clause). Any misrepresentations by the insured on the application may also be grounds for nullification. Most US states specify a maximum contestability period, often no more than two years. Only if the insured dies within this period will the insurer have a legal right to contest the claim on the basis of misrepresentation and request additional information before deciding whether to pay or deny the claim.\n\nThe face amount of the policy is the initial amount that the policy will pay at the death of the insured or when the policy [[Maturity (finance)|matures]], although the actual death benefit can provide for greater or lesser than the face amount. The policy matures when the insured dies or reaches a specified age (such as 100 years old).\n\n===Costs, insurability, and underwriting===\nThe insurance company calculates the policy prices (premiums) at a level sufficient to fund claims, cover administrative costs, and provide a profit. The cost of insurance is determined using mortality tables calculated by [[actuary|actuaries]]. Mortality tables are statistically based tables showing expected annual mortality rates of people at different ages. Put simply, people are more likely to die as they get older and the mortality tables enable the insurance companies to calculate the risk and increase premiums with age accordingly. Such estimates can be important in taxation regulation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement/article/0,,id=103045,00.html#12|title=IRS Retirement Plans FAQs regarding Revenue Ruling 2002-62|website=irs.gov|accessdate=14 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120808064248/http://www.irs.gov/retirement/article/0,,id=103045,00.html#12|archivedate=8 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-irbs/irb02-42.pdf|title=IRS Bulletin No. 2002\u201342|website=irs.gov|accessdate=14 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170502202442/https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-irbs/irb02-42.pdf|archivedate=2 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the SOA 1975-80 Basic Select & Ultimate tables were the typical reference points, while the 2001 VBT and 2001 CSO tables were published more recently.

At the end of 10 years, the mortality of that 25-year-old, non-smoking male is 0.66/1000/year. Consequently, in a group of one thousand 25-year-old males with a $100,000 policy, all of average health, a life insurance company would have to collect approximately $50 a year from each participant to cover the relatively few expected claims. (0.35 to 0.66 expected deaths in each year \u00d7 $100,000 payout per death = $35 per policy.) Other costs, such as administrative and sales expenses, also need to be considered when setting the premiums. A 10-year policy for a 25-year-old non-smoking male with preferred medical history may get offers as low as $90 per year for a $100,000 policy in the competitive US life insurance market.\n\nMost of the revenue received by insurance companies consists of premiums, but revenue from investing the premiums forms an important source of profit for most life insurance companies. [[Group Insurance]] policies are an exception to this.\n\nIn the United States, life insurance companies are never legally required to provide coverage to everyone, with the exception of [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]] compliance requirements. Insurance companies alone determine insurability, and some people are deemed uninsurable. The policy can be declined or rated (increasing the premium amount to compensate for the higher risk), and the amount of the premium will be proportional to the face value of the policy.\n\nMany companies separate applicants into four general categories. These categories are ''preferred best'', ''preferred'', ''standard'', and ''tobacco''. Preferred best is reserved only for the healthiest individuals in the general population. This may mean, that the proposed insured has no adverse medical history, is not under medication, and has no family history of early-onset [[cancer]], [[diabetes]], or other conditions.<ref>{{cite web|title=How do Insurance Rating Classifications Work?|url=http://seniorlifepolicies.com/how-do-insurance-rating-classifications-work/|accessdate=4 November 2011}}{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Preferred means that the proposed insured is currently under medication and has a family history of particular illnesses. Most people are in the standard category.\n\nPeople in the tobacco category typically have to pay higher premiums due to the higher mortality.

If the insured's death is suspicious and the policy amount is large, the insurer may investigate the circumstances surrounding the death before deciding whether it has an obligation to pay the claim.\n\nPayment from the policy may be as a lump sum or as an [[Annuity (financial contracts)|annuity]], which is paid in regular installments for either a specified period or [[Life annuity|for the beneficiary's lifetime]].<ref name=\"OECD2016\">{{cite book|author=OECD|title=Life Annuity Products and Their Guarantees|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9_GmDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA10|date=5 December 2016|publisher=OECD Publishing|isbn=978-92-64-26531-8|pages=10\u201313}}</ref>\n\n===Insurance vs assurance===\nThe specific uses of the terms \u201cinsurance\u201d and \u201cassurance\u201d are sometimes confused. In general, in jurisdictions where both terms are used, \u201cinsurance\u201d refers to providing coverage for an event that ''might'' happen (fire, theft, flood, etc.), while \u201cassurance\u201d is the provision of coverage for an event that is ''certain'' to happen. In the United States, both forms of coverage are called \u201cinsurance\u201d for reasons of simplicity in companies selling both products.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} By some definitions, \u201cinsurance\u201d is any coverage that determines benefits based on actual losses whereas \u201cassurance\u201d is coverage with predetermined benefits irrespective of the losses incurred.\n\nLife insurance may be divided into two basic classes: temporary and permanent; or the following subclasses: term, universal, [[Whole life insurance|whole life]], and endowment life insurance.\n\n===Term insurance===\n{{Main|Term life insurance}}\n\n[[Term assurance]] provides life insurance coverage for a specified term. The policy does not accumulate cash value. Term insurance is significantly less expensive than an equivalent permanent policy but will become higher with age. Policy holders can save to provide for increased term premiums or decrease insurance needs (by paying off debts or saving to provide for survivor needs).<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Black |first1=Kenneth, Jr. |last2=Skipper |first2=Harold D., Jr. |title=Life Insurance |edition=4th |year=1994 |page=94 |isbn=0135329957}}</ref>\n\n''[[Mortgage life insurance]]'' insures a loan secured by real property and usually features a level premium amount for a declining policy face value because what is insured is the principal and interest outstanding on a mortgage that is constantly being reduced by mortgage payments. The face amount of the policy is always the amount of the principal and interest outstanding that are paid should the applicant die before the final installment is paid.\n\n==== Group life insurance ====\n''Group life insurance'' (also known as ''wholesale life insurance'' or ''institutional life insurance'') is term insurance covering a group of people, usually employees of a company, members of a union or association, or members of a pension or [[superannuation]] fund. Individual proof of insurability is not normally a consideration in its underwriting. Rather, the underwriter considers the size, turnover, and financial strength of the group. Contract provisions will attempt to exclude the possibility of [[adverse selection]]. Group life insurance often allows members exiting the group to maintain their coverage by buying individual coverage. The underwriting is carried out for the whole group instead of individuals.\n\n===Permanent life insurance===\n''Permanent life insurance'' is life insurance that covers the remaining lifetime of the insured. A permanent insurance policy accumulates a [[cash value]] up to its date of maturation. The owner can access the money in the cash value by withdrawing money, borrowing the cash value, or surrendering the policy and receiving the surrender value.\n\nThe three basic types of permanent insurance are ''whole life'', ''universal life'', and ''endowment''.\n\n====Whole life====\n{{Main|Whole life insurance}}\nWhole life insurance provides lifetime coverage for a set premium amount (see main article for a full explanation of the many variations and options).\n\n====Universal life coverage====\n[[Universal life insurance]] (ULl) is a relatively new insurance product, intended to combine permanent insurance coverage with greater flexibility in premium payments, along with the potential for greater growth of cash values. There are several types of universal life insurance policies, including ''interest-sensitive'' (also known as \u201ctraditional fixed universal life insurance\u201d), ''variable universal life (VUL)'', ''guaranteed death benefit'', and has ''equity-indexed universal life insurance''.\n\nUniversal life insurance policies have cash values. Paid-in premiums increase their cash values; administrative and other costs reduce their cash values.\n\nUniversal life insurance addresses the perceived disadvantages of whole life\u2014namely that premiums and death benefits are fixed. With universal life, both the premiums and death benefit are flexible. With the exception of guaranteed-death-benefit universal life policies, universal life policies trade their greater flexibility off for fewer guarantees.\n\n\u201cFlexible death benefit\u201d means the policy owner can choose to decrease the death benefit. The death benefit can also be increased by the policy owner, usually requiring new underwriting. Another feature of flexible death benefit is the ability to choose option A or option B death benefits and to change those options over the course of the life of the insured. Option A is often referred to as a \"level death benefit\"; death benefits remain level for the life of the insured, and premiums are lower than policies with Option B death benefits, which pay the policy's cash value\u2014i.e., a face amount plus earnings/interest. If the cash value grows over time, the death benefits do too. If the cash value declines, the death benefit also declines. Option B policies normally feature higher premiums than option A policies.\n\n====Endowments====\n{{main|Endowment policy}}\nThe endowment policy is a life insurance contract designed to pay a lump sum after a specific term (on its 'maturity') or on death. Typical maturities are ten, fifteen or twenty years up to a certain age limit. Some policies also pay out in the case of critical illness.\n\nPolicies are typically traditional with-profits or unit-linked (including those with unitized with-profits funds).\n\nEndowments can be cashed in early (or surrendered) and the holder then receives the surrender value which is determined by the insurance company depending on how long the policy has been running and how much has been paid into it.\n\n====Accidental death====\nAccidental death insurance is a type of limited life insurance that is designed to cover the insured should they die as the result of an accident. \u201cAccidents\u201d run the gamut from abrasions to catastrophes but normally do not include deaths resulting from non-accident-related health problems or suicide. Because they only cover accidents, these policies are much less expensive than other life insurance policies.\n\nSuch insurance can also be ''[[accidental death and dismemberment insurance]]'' or ''AD&D''. In an AD&D policy, benefits are available not only for accidental death but also for the loss of limbs or body functions such as sight and hearing.\n\nAccidental death and AD&D policies ''very rarely pay'' a benefit, either because the cause of death is not covered by the policy or because death occurs well after the accident, by which time the premiums have gone unpaid. To know what coverage they have, insureds should always review their policies. Risky activities such as parachuting, flying, professional sports, or military service are often omitted from coverage.\n\nAccidental death insurance can also supplement standard life insurance as a [[rider (contract)|rider]]. If a rider is purchased, the policy generally pays double the face amount if the insured dies from an accident. This was once called ''[[double indemnity (insurance)|double indemnity]] insurance''. In some cases, triple indemnity coverage may be available.\n\n==== Senior and pre-need products ====\nInsurance companies have in recent years developed products for niche markets, most notably targeting seniors in an ageing population. These are often low to moderate face value whole life insurance policies, allowing senior citizens to purchase affordable insurance later in life. This may also be marketed as ''final expense insurance'' and usually have death benefits between $2,000 and $40,000. One reason for their popularity is that they only require answers to simple \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d questions, while most policies require a medical exam to qualify. As with other policy types, the range of premiums can vary widely and should be scrutinized prior to purchase, as should the reliability of the companies.\n\nHealth questions can vary substantially between exam and no-exam policies. It may be possible for individuals with certain conditions to qualify for one type of coverage and not another.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}  Because seniors sometimes are not fully aware of the policy provisions it is important to make sure that policies last for a lifetime and that premiums do not increase every 5 years as is common in some circumstances.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n''Pre-need life insurance policies'' are limited premium payment, whole life policies that are usually purchased by older applicants, though they are available to everyone. This type of insurance is designed to cover specific [[funeral]] expenses that the applicant has designated in a contract with a [[funeral home]]. The policy's death benefit is initially based on the funeral cost at the time of prearrangement, and it then typically grows as interest is credited. In exchange for the policy owner's designation, the funeral home typically guarantees that the proceeds will cover the cost of the funeral, no matter when death occurs. Excess proceeds may go either to the insured's estate, a designated beneficiary, or the funeral home as set forth in the contract. Purchasers of these policies usually make a single premium payment at the time of prearrangement, but some companies also allow premiums to be paid over as much as ten years.\n\n==Related products==\n''Riders'' are modifications to the insurance policy added at the same time the policy is issued. These riders change the basic policy to provide some feature desired by the policy owner. A common rider is ''accidental death'' (see above). Another common rider is a ''premium waiver'', which waives future premiums if the insured becomes disabled.\n\n''Joint life insurance'' is either term or permanent life insurance that insures two or more persons, with proceeds payable on the death of ''either''.\n\n===Unit Linked Insurance Plans===\n{{Main|Unit-linked insurance plan}}\nThese are unique insurance plans which are basically a mutual fund and term insurance plan rolled into one. The investor doesn't participate in the profits of the plan per se, but gets returns based on the returns on the funds he or she had chosen.\n\nSee the main article for a full explanation of the various features and variations.\n\n===With-profits policies===\n{{Main|With-profits policy}}\nSome policies afford the policyholder a share of the profits of the insurance company\u2014these are termed [[with-profits policy|with-profits policies]]. Other policies provide no rights to a share of the profits of the company\u2014these are ''non-profit'' policies.\n\nWith-profits policies are used as a form of [[collective investment scheme]] to achieve capital growth. Other policies offer a guaranteed return not dependent on the company's underlying investment performance; these are often referred to as ''without-profit'' policies, which may be construed as a misnomer.\n\n==Taxation==\n\n=== India ===\nAccording to the section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (of Indian penal code) premiums paid towards a valid life insurance policy can be exempted from the taxable income. Along with life insurance premium, section 80C allows exemption for other financial instruments such as Employee Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS), National Savings Certificate (NSC), health insurance premium are some of them. The total amount that can be exempted from the taxable income for section 80C is capped at a maximum of INR 150,000.<ref>{{cite web |title=Section - 80C, Income-tax Act, 1961-2018:B.\u2014Deductions in respect of certain payments |url=https://www.incometaxindia.gov.in/pages/acts/income-tax-act.aspx |website=Income Tax India |accessdate=6 November 2018}}</ref> The exemptions are eligible for individuals (Indian citizens) or Hindu Undivided Family (HUF).\n\n===Australia===\nWhere the life insurance is provided through a superannuation fund, contributions made to fund insurance premiums are tax deductible for self-employed persons and substantially self-employed persons and employers. However where life insurance is held outside of the superannuation environment, the premiums are generally not tax deductible. For insurance through a superannuation fund, the annual deductible contributions to the superannuation funds are subject to age limits. These limits apply to employers making deductible contributions. They also apply to self-employed persons and substantially self-employed persons. Included in these overall limits are insurance premiums. This means that no additional deductible contributions can be made for the funding of insurance premiums. Insurance premiums can, however, be funded by undeducted contributions. For further information on deductible contributions see \u201cunder what conditions can an employer claim a deduction for contributions made on behalf of their employees?\u201d and \u201cwhat is the definition of substantially self-employed?\u201d. The insurance premium paid by the superannuation fund can be claimed by the fund as a deduction to reduce the 15% tax on contributions and earnings. (Ref: ITAA 1936, Section 279).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://law.ato.gov.au/atolaw/view.htm?docid=%22AID%2FAID201076%2F00001%22 |title=ITAA 1936, Section 279 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828093936/http://law.ato.gov.au/atolaw/view.htm?docid=%22AID%2FAID201076%2F00001%22 |archivedate=2011-08-28 }}</ref>\n\n===South Africa===\nPremiums paid by a [[policyholder]] are not deductible from taxable income, although premiums paid via an approved [[pension fund]] registered in terms of the Income Tax Act are permitted to be deducted from personal income tax (whether these premiums are nominally being paid by the employer or employee). The benefits arising from life assurance policies are generally not taxable as income to beneficiaries (again in the case of approved benefits, these fall under retirement or withdrawal taxation rules from [[South African Revenue Service|SARS]]). Investment return within the policy will be taxed within the life policy and paid by the life assurer depending on the nature of the policyholder (whether natural person, company-owned, untaxed or a retirement fund).\n\n===United States===\nPremiums paid by the policy owner are normally not deductible for federal and state [[income tax]] purposes, and proceeds paid by the insurer upon the death of the insured are not included in gross income for federal and state income tax purposes.<ref>Internal Revenue Code \u00a7 101(a)(1)</ref> However, if the proceeds are included in the \"estate\" of the deceased, it is likely they will be subject to federal and state [[Estate tax (United States)|estate and inheritance tax]].\n\nCash value increases within the policy are not subject to income taxes unless certain events occur. For this reason, insurance policies can be a legal and legitimate [[tax shelter]] wherein savings can increase without taxation until the owner withdraws the money from the policy. In flexible-premium policies, large deposits of premium could cause the contract to be considered a ''modified endowment contract'' by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS), which negates many of the tax advantages associated with life insurance. The insurance company, in most cases, will inform the policy owner of this danger before deciding their premium.\n\nThe tax ramifications of life insurance are complex. The policy owner would be well advised to carefully consider them. As always, both the [[United States Congress]] and state legislatures can change the tax laws at any time.\n\nIn 2018, a [[fiduciary]] standard rule on retirement products by the [[United States Department of Labor]] posed a possible risk.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/financial-services/articles/insurance-industry-outlook.html|title=2018 Insurance Industry Outlook {{!}} Deloitte US|website=Deloitte United States|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\nPremiums are not usually deductible against income tax or [[corporation tax]], however qualifying policies issued prior to 14 March 1984 do still attract LAPR ([[Life Assurance Premium Relief]]) at 15% (with the net premium being collected from the policyholder).\n\nNon-investment life policies do not normally attract either income tax or [[capital gains tax]] on a claim. If the policy has as investment element such as an endowment policy, whole of life policy or an investment bond then the tax treatment is determined by the qualifying status of the policy.\n\nQualifying status is determined at the outset of the policy if the contract meets certain criteria. Essentially, long term contracts (10+ years) tend to be qualifying policies and the proceeds are free from income tax and capital gains tax. Single premium contracts and those running for a short term are subject to income tax depending upon the marginal rate in the year a gain is made. All UK insurers pay a special rate of corporation tax on the profits from their life book; this is deemed as meeting the lower rate (20% in 2005-06) of liability for policyholders. Therefore, a policyholder who is a higher-rate taxpayer (40% in 2005-06), or becomes one through the transaction, must pay tax on the gain at the difference between the higher and the lower rate. This gain is reduced by applying a calculation called [[top-slicing]] based on the number of years the policy has been held. Although this is complicated, the taxation of life assurance-based investment contracts may be beneficial compared to alternative equity-based collective investment schemes ([[unit trust]]s, [[investment trust]]s and [[Open-ended investment company|OEICs]]). One feature which especially favors investment bonds is the \u201c5% cumulative allowance\u201d\u2014the ability to draw 5% of the original investment amount each policy year without being subject to any taxation on the amount withdrawn. If not used in one year, the 5% allowance can roll over into future years, subject to a maximum tax-deferred withdrawal of 100% of the premiums payable. The withdrawal is deemed by the [[HMRC]] (Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs) to be a payment of capital and therefore, the tax liability is deferred until maturity or surrender of the policy. This is an especially useful [[tax planning]] tool for higher rate taxpayers who expect to become basic rate taxpayers at some predictable point in the future, as at this point the deferred tax liability will not result in tax being due.\n\nThe proceeds of a life policy will be included in the estate for [[death duty]] (in the UK, [[inheritance tax]]) purposes. Policies written in [[Trust law|trust]] may fall outside the estate. Trust law and taxation of trusts can be complicated, so any individual intending to use trusts for tax planning would usually seek professional advice from an [[independent financial adviser]] and/or a [[solicitor]].\n\n====Pension term assurance====\nAlthough available before April 2006, from this date [[pension term assurance]] became widely available in the UK. Most UK insurers adopted the name \"life insurance with tax relief\" for the product. Pension term assurance is effectively normal term life assurance with tax relief on the premiums. All premiums are paid at a net of basic rate tax at 22%, and higher-rate tax payers can gain an extra 18% tax relief via their tax return. Although not suitable for all, PTA briefly became one of the most common forms of life assurance sold in the UK until, [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]] [[Gordon Brown]] announced the withdrawal of the scheme in his pre-budget announcement on 6 December 2006.\n\n==Stranger originated==\n''Stranger-originated life insurance'' or [[Stranger-originated life insurance|STOLI]] is a life insurance policy that is held or financed by a person who has no relationship to the insured person. Generally, the purpose of life insurance is to provide peace of mind by assuring that financial loss or hardship will be alleviated in the event of the insured person's death. STOLI has often been used as an investment technique whereby investors will encourage someone (usually an elderly person) to purchase life insurance and name the investors as the beneficiary of the policy. This undermines the primary purpose of life insurance, as the investors would incur no financial loss should the insured person die. In some jurisdictions, there are laws to discourage or prevent STOLI.\n\n==Criticism==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2011}}\nAlthough some aspects of the application process (such as [[underwriting]] and insurable interest provisions) make it difficult, life insurance policies have been used to facilitate exploitation and [[ fraud]]. In the case of life insurance, there is a possible motive to purchase a life insurance policy, particularly if the face value is substantial, and then [[murder]] the insured. Usually, the larger the claim and/or the more serious the incident, the larger and more intense the ensuing investigation by police and insurer investigators.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insurancefraud.org/impact_statmnt.htm|title=Fraud: why should you worry?|first=dennis jay, jim quiggle, howard goldblatt, kendra smith, jennifer|last=tchinnosian|website=www.insurancefraud.org|accessdate=14 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113034803/http://www.insurancefraud.org/impact_statmnt.htm|archivedate=13 November 2012}}</ref> The [[television series]] ''[[Forensic Files]]'' has included episodes that feature this scenario. There was also a documented case in Los Angeles in 2006 where two elderly women were accused of taking in homeless men and assisting them.

A viatical settlement involves the purchase of a life insurance policy from an elderly or terminally ill policy holder. The policy holder sells the policy (including the right to name the beneficiary) to a purchaser for a price discounted from the policy value. The seller has cash in hand, and the purchaser will realize a [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] when the seller dies and the proceeds are delivered to the purchaser. In the meantime, the purchaser continues to pay the premiums. Although both parties have reached an agreeable settlement, insurers are troubled by this trend. Insurers calculate their rates with the assumption that a certain portion of policy holders will seek to redeem the cash value of their insurance policies before death. They also expect that a certain portion will stop paying premiums and forfeit their policies. However, viatical settlements ensure that such policies will with absolute certainty be paid out. Some purchasers, in order to take advantage of the potentially large profits, have even actively sought to collude with uninsured elderly and terminally ill patients, and created policies that would have not otherwise been purchased.

The supporting cast features [[Mae Busch]], [[Matt Moore (actor)|Matt Moore]], [[Victor McLaglen]] and [[Harry Earles]].\n\nThe film was [[remake|remade]] in 1930 as a [[talkie]]. In both the 1925 and the [[The Unholy Three (1930 film)|1930 version]], the roles of Professor Echo and Tweedledee are played by Chaney and Earles respectively. The films were based on the novel of the same name by [[Tod Robbins]].\n\n==Plot==\nThree performers leave a [[sideshow]] after Tweedledee ([[Harry Earles]]), the [[midget]], assaults a young heckler and sparks a melee. The three join together in an \"unholy\" plan to become wealthy. Prof. Echo, the [[ventriloquist]], assumes the role of Mrs. O'Grady, a kindly old grandmother, who runs a pet shop, while Tweedledee plays her grandchild. Hercules ([[Victor McLaglen]]), the [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]], works in the shop along with the unsuspecting Hector McDonald ([[Matt Moore (actor)|Matt Moore]]). Echo's girlfriend, pickpocket Rosie O'Grady ([[Mae Busch]]), pretends to be his granddaughter.\n\nUsing what they learn from delivering pets, the trio later commit burglaries, with their wealthy buyers as victims. On Christmas Eve, John Arlington (an uncredited [[Charles Wellesley]]) telephones to complain that the \"talking\" parrot (aided by Echo's ventriloquism) he bought will not speak. When \"Granny\" O'Grady visits him to coax the bird into performing, \"she\" takes along grandson \"Little Willie\". While there, they learn that a valuable ruby necklace is in the house. They decide to steal it that night. As Echo is too busy, the other two grow impatient and decide to go ahead without him.\n\nThe next day, Echo is furious to read in the newspaper that Arlington was killed and his three-year-old daughter badly injured in the robbery. Hercules shows no remorse whatsoever, relating how Arlington pleaded for his life. When a police investigator shows up at the shop, the trio become fearful and decide to frame Hector, hiding the jewelry in his room.\n\nMeanwhile, Hector proposes to Rosie. She turns him down, but he overhears her crying after he leaves. To his joy, she confesses she loves him, but was ashamed of her shady past. When the police take him away, Rosie tells the trio that she will exonerate him, forcing them to abduct her and flee to a mountain cabin. Echo takes along his large pet ape (who terrifies Hercules).\n\nIn the spring, Hector is brought to trial. Rosie pleads with Echo to save Hector, promising to stay with him if he does. After Echo leaves for the city, Tweedledee overhears Hercules asking Rosie to run away with him (and the loot). The midget releases the ape. Hercules kills the midget before the ape gets him.\n\nAt the trial, Echo agonizes over what to do, but finally rushes forward and confesses all. Both he and Hector are set free. When Rosie goes to Echo to keep her promise, he lies and says he was only kidding. He tells her to go to Hector. Echo returns to the sideshow, giving his spiel to the customers: \"That's all there is to life, friends, ... a little laughter ... a little tear.\"\n\n==Themes==\nAs is common of a Tod Browning film, circus life and unusual bodies play a central role in this movie along with great use of trompe l\u2019oeil.<ref name=\":0\">Thomas, Randal Kerry. \"Symbolic Structure of the Circus in the Films of Tod Browning.\" June 1977.

The main plot of the movie revolves around the character\u2019s abilities to pass themselves off convincingly as something they are not, an illusion the movie peels back and reasserts for both the other characters and for the audience themselves. Contrary to the usual use of this effect, Browning makes it a point to disillusion the audience and display the workings of the illusion to create a different sort of viewing stimulation.<ref>Manon, Hugh S. \"Seeing Through Seeing Through: The \"Trompe l'Oeil\" Effect and Bodily Difference in the Cinema of Tod Browning.\" 2006.

When Echo removes the ape from his cage, the shot shows Echo (with his back turned to the camera) unlocking the cage and walking the ape to the truck. The ape appears to be roughly the same size as Echo. This effect was achieved by having midget actor Harry Earles (who played \"Tweedledee\" in the film) play Echo for these brief shots, and then cutting to Chaney, making it seem as though the ape is gigantic.

The modern welfare system is based on the concept of entitlement to the basic means of being a productive member of [[society]] both as an organic function of society and as compensation for the socially useful labor provided. A single mother's contribution to society is not based on [[informal sector|formal employment]], but on the notion that provision of welfare for children is a necessary social expense. In some career contexts, caring work is devalued and [[motherhood]] is seen as a barrier to employment.<ref>{{cite journal | last =Lessa | first = Iara | title=Discursive struggles within social welfare: Restaging teen motherhood | journal= [[The British Journal of Social Work]] | volume=36 | issue = 2 | pages=283\u2013298 | doi=10.1093/bjsw/bch256 | date = February 2006 }}</ref> Single mothers were previously marginalized in spite of their significant role in the socializing of [[children]] due to views that an individual can only contribute meaningfully to society through \"gainful\" employment as well as a cultural bias against unwed mothers. When the father's sole task was seen as the breadwinner, his marginalization was primarily a function of class condition. Solo fatherhood brings additional trials due to society being less accepting of males 'getting away with' not working and the general invisibility/lack of acknowledgment of single fathers in society.

Feminists argued that men and women should equally participate in the labor force, in the public and private sector, and in the home.

In some places today, women are still marginalized from [[Executive (management)|executive]] positions and continue to earn less than men in [[Senior management|upper management]] positions.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/equal-pay | title=Did You Know That Women Are Still Paid Less Than Men? | publisher=White House | accessdate=February 7, 2013 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121226155540/http://www.whitehouse.gov/equal-pay | archivedate=December 26, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nAnother example of individual marginalization is the exclusion of individuals with [[disabilities]] from the [[Labour (economics)|labor]] force.

Major contributors include race, income, employment status, social class, geographic location, personal habits and appearance, education, religion, and political affiliation.\n\n===Global and structural===\n\n[[Globalization]] (global-capitalism), immigration, social welfare, and policy are broader social structures that have the potential to contribute negatively to one's access to resources and services, resulting in the social exclusion of individuals and groups. Similarly, increasing use of information technology and the company [[outsourcing]] have contributed to [[job insecurity]] and a widening gap between the rich and the poor. Alphonse, George & Moffat (2007) discuss how globalization sets forth a decrease in the role of the state with an increase in support from various \"corporate sectors resulting in gross inequalities, injustices and marginalization of various vulnerable groups\" (p.&nbsp;1). Companies are outsourcing, jobs are lost, the [[cost of living]] continues to rise, and the land is being [[expropriate]]d by large companies. Material goods are made in large abundances and sold at cheaper costs, while in India for example, the [[poverty line]] is lowered in order to mask the number of individuals who are actually living in poverty as a result of globalization. Globalization and structural forces aggravate poverty and continue to push individuals to the margins of society, while governments and large corporations do not address the issues (George, P, SK8101, lecture, October 9, 2007).\n\nCertain language and the meaning attached to language can cause universalizing discourses that are influenced by the Western world, which is what Sewpaul (2006) describes as the \"potential to dilute or even [[annihilate]] local cultures and traditions and to deny context-specific realities\" (p.&nbsp;421). What Sewpaul (2006) is implying is that the effect of dominant global discourses can cause individual and cultural displacement, as well as an experience of \"de-localization\", as individual notions of security and safety are jeopardized (p.&nbsp;422). Insecurity and fear of an unknown future and instability can result in displacement, exclusion, and forced [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] into the dominant group. For many, it further pushes them to the margins of society or enlists new members to the outskirts because of global-capitalism and dominant discourses (Sewpaul, 2006).\n\nWith the prevailing notion of globalization, we now see the rise of [[immigration]] as the world gets smaller and smaller with millions of individuals relocating each year. This is not without hardship and struggle of what a newcomer thought was going to be a new life with new opportunities. Ferguson, Lavalette, & Whitmore (2005) discuss how immigration has had a strong link to the access of welfare support programs. Newcomers are constantly bombarded with the inability to access a country's resources because they are seen as \"undeserving foreigners\" (p.&nbsp;132). With this comes a denial of access to [[public housing]], [[health care]] benefits, [[employment]] support services, and [[social security]] benefits (Ferguson et al., 2005). Newcomers are seen as undeserving, or that they must prove their [[entitlement]] in order to gain access to basic support necessities. It is clear that individuals are [[Exploitation of labor|exploited]] and marginalized within the country they have emigrated (Ferguson et al., 2005).\n\n[[Welfare state]]s and social policies can also exclude individuals from basic necessities and support programs. Welfare payments were proposed to assist individuals in accessing a small amount of [[material wealth]] (Young, 2000). Young (2000) further discusses how \"the provision of the welfare itself produces new injustice by depriving those dependent on it of rights and freedoms that others have\u2026marginalization is unjust because it blocks the opportunity to exercise capacities in socially defined and recognized way\" (p.&nbsp;41). There is the notion that by providing a minimal amount of welfare support, an individual will be free from marginalization. In fact, welfare support programs further lead to injustices by restricting certain behaviour, as well the individual is mandated to other agencies. The individual is forced into a new system of rules while facing [[social stigma]] and [[stereotypes]] from the dominant group in society, further marginalizing and excluding individuals (Young, 2000). Thus, social policy and welfare provisions reflect the dominant notions in society by constructing and reinforcing categories of people and their needs. It ignores the unique-subjective human essence, further continuing the cycle of dominance (Wilson & Beresford, 2000).\n\n===Unemployment===\n{{see also|Blacklisting|Involuntary unemployment}}\nWhilst recognising the multi-dimensionality of exclusion, policy work undertaken in the [[European Union]] focused{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} on [[unemployment]] as a key cause of, or at least correlating with, social exclusion. This is because, in modern societies, paid work is not only the principal source of income with which to buy services but is also the fount of individuals' identity and feeling of self-worth. Most people's social networks and a sense of embeddedness in society also revolve around their work. Many of the indicators of extreme social exclusion, such as poverty and homelessness, depend on monetary income which is normally derived from work. Social exclusion can be a possible result of long-term unemployment, especially in countries with weak welfare safety nets.<ref>Furlong, Andy. ''Youth Studies: An Introduction''. Routledge, 2013, p. 31.</ref> Much policy to reduce exclusion thus focuses on the labour market:\n* On the one hand, to make individuals at risk of exclusion more attractive to employers, i.e. more \"employable\".\n* On the other hand, to encourage (and/or oblige) employers to be more inclusive in their employment policies.\n\nThe EU's [[EQUAL Community Initiative]] investigated ways to increase the inclusiveness of the labor market. Work on social exclusion more broadly is carried out through the [[Open Method of Coordination]] (OMC) among the Member State governments.\n\n===Religion===\n{{see also|Shunning#in religion}}\nSome religious traditions recommend [[excommunication]] of individuals said to deviate from religious teaching, and in some instances [[shunning]] by family members. Some religious organizations permit the censure of critics.\n\nAcross societies, individuals and communities can be socially excluded on the basis of their religious beliefs. Social hostility against religious minorities and [[communal violence]] occur in areas where governments do not have policies restricting the religious practise of minorities.

Based on the UK's [[Social Exclusion Unit]], established by Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] in 1997, Rann established the Social Inclusion Initiative in 2002. It was headed by Monsignor [[David Cappo]] and was serviced by a unit within the department of Premier and Cabinet.

A non-judgmental and unbiased attitude is necessary on the part of the social worker. The worker must begin to understand [[oppression]] and marginalization as a systemic problem, not the fault of the individual.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWorking under an anti-oppression perspective would then allow the social worker to understand the lived, subjective experiences of the individual, as well as their cultural, historical and social background. The worker should recognize the individual as political in the process of becoming a valuable member of society and the structural factors that contribute to oppression and marginalization (Mullaly, 2007).<ref name=\":0\" /> Social workers must take a firm stance on naming and labeling global forces that impact individuals and communities who are then left with no support, leading to marginalization or further marginalization from the society they once knew (George, P, SK8101, lecture, October 9, 2007).\n\nThe social worker should be constantly [[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexive]], work to raise the consciousness, [[Empowerment|empower]], and understand the lived subjective realities of individuals living in a fast-paced world, where fear and insecurity constantly subjugate the individual from the collective whole, perpetuating the dominant forces, while silencing the oppressed.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sakamoto|first=Izumi|last2=Pitner|first2=Ronald O.|date=June 2005|title=Use of Critical Consciousness in Anti-Oppressive Social Work Practice: Disentangling Power Dynamics at Personal and Structural Levels|url=https://academic.oup.com/bjsw/article-abstract/35/4/435/1716745|journal=The British Journal of Social Work|volume= 35| issue = 4|pages=435\u2013452|doi=10.1093/bjsw/bch190}}</ref>\n\nSome individuals and groups who are not professional social workers build relationships with marginalized persons by providing [[relational care]] and support, for example, through [[homeless ministry]].

Major contributors include race, income, employment status, social class, geographic location, personal habits and appearance, education, religion, and political affiliation.\n\n===Global and structural===\n\n[[Globalization]] (global-capitalism), immigration, social welfare, and policy are broader social structures that have the potential to contribute negatively to one's access to resources and services, resulting in the social exclusion of individuals and groups. Similarly, increasing use of information technology and the company [[outsourcing]] have contributed to [[job insecurity]] and a widening gap between the rich and the poor. Alphonse, George & Moffat (2007) discuss how globalization sets forth a decrease in the role of the state with an increase in support from various \"corporate sectors resulting in gross inequalities, injustices and marginalization of various vulnerable groups\" (p.&nbsp;1). Companies are outsourcing, jobs are lost, the [[cost of living]] continues to rise, and the land is being [[expropriate]]d by large companies. Material goods are made in large abundances and sold at cheaper costs, while in India for example, the [[poverty line]] is lowered in order to mask the number of individuals who are actually living in poverty as a result of globalization. Globalization and structural forces aggravate poverty and continue to push individuals to the margins of society, while governments and large corporations do not address the issues (George, P, SK8101, lecture, October 9, 2007).\n\nCertain language and the meaning attached to language can cause universalizing discourses that are influenced by the Western world, which is what Sewpaul (2006) describes as the \"potential to dilute or even [[annihilate]] local cultures and traditions and to deny context-specific realities\" (p.&nbsp;421). What Sewpaul (2006) is implying is that the effect of dominant global discourses can cause individual and cultural displacement, as well as an experience of \"de-localization\", as individual notions of security and safety are jeopardized (p.&nbsp;422). Insecurity and fear of an unknown future and instability can result in displacement, exclusion, and forced [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] into the dominant group. For many, it further pushes them to the margins of society or enlists new members to the outskirts because of global-capitalism and dominant discourses (Sewpaul, 2006).\n\nWith the prevailing notion of globalization, we now see the rise of [[immigration]] as the world gets smaller and smaller with millions of individuals relocating each year. This is not without hardship and struggle of what a newcomer thought was going to be a new life with new opportunities. Ferguson, Lavalette, & Whitmore (2005) discuss how immigration has had a strong link to the access of welfare support programs. Newcomers are constantly bombarded with the inability to access a country's resources because they are seen as \"undeserving foreigners\" (p.&nbsp;132). With this comes a denial of access to [[public housing]], [[health care]] benefits, [[employment]] support services, and [[social security]] benefits (Ferguson et al., 2005). Newcomers are seen as undeserving, or that they must prove their [[entitlement]] in order to gain access to basic support necessities. It is clear that individuals are [[Exploitation of labor|exploited]] and marginalized within the country they have emigrated (Ferguson et al., 2005).\n\n[[Welfare state]]s and social policies can also exclude individuals from basic necessities and support programs. Welfare payments were proposed to assist individuals in accessing a small amount of [[material wealth]] (Young, 2000). Young (2000) further discusses how \"the provision of the welfare itself produces new injustice by depriving those dependent on it of rights and freedoms that others have\u2026marginalization is unjust because it blocks the opportunity to exercise capacities in socially defined and recognized way\" (p.&nbsp;41). There is the notion that by providing a minimal amount of welfare support, an individual will be free from marginalization. In fact, welfare support programs further lead to injustices by restricting certain behaviour, as well the individual is mandated to other agencies. The individual is forced into a new system of rules while facing [[social stigma]] and [[stereotypes]] from the dominant group in society, further marginalizing and excluding individuals (Young, 2000). Thus, social policy and welfare provisions reflect the dominant notions in society by constructing and reinforcing categories of people and their needs. It ignores the unique-subjective human essence, further continuing the cycle of dominance (Wilson & Beresford, 2000).\n\n===Unemployment===\n{{see also|Blacklisting|Involuntary unemployment}}\nWhilst recognising the multi-dimensionality of exclusion, policy work undertaken in the [[European Union]] focused{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} on [[unemployment]] as a key cause of, or at least correlating with, social exclusion. This is because, in modern societies, paid work is not only the principal source of income with which to buy services but is also the fount of individuals' identity and feeling of self-worth. Most people's social networks and a sense of embeddedness in society also revolve around their work. Many of the indicators of extreme social exclusion, such as poverty and homelessness, depend on monetary income which is normally derived from work. Social exclusion can be a possible result of long-term unemployment, especially in countries with weak welfare safety nets.<ref>Furlong, Andy. ''Youth Studies: An Introduction''. Routledge, 2013, p. 31.</ref> Much policy to reduce exclusion thus focuses on the labour market:\n* On the one hand, to make individuals at risk of exclusion more attractive to employers, i.e. more \"employable\".\n* On the other hand, to encourage (and/or oblige) employers to be more inclusive in their employment policies.\n\nThe EU's [[EQUAL Community Initiative]] investigated ways to increase the inclusiveness of the labor market. Work on social exclusion more broadly is carried out through the [[Open Method of Coordination]] (OMC) among the Member State governments.\n\n===Religion===\n{{see also|Shunning#in religion}}\nSome religious traditions recommend [[excommunication]] of individuals said to deviate from religious teaching, and in some instances [[shunning]] by family members. Some religious organizations permit the censure of critics.\n\nAcross societies, individuals and communities can be socially excluded on the basis of their religious beliefs. Social hostility against religious minorities and [[communal violence]] occur in areas where governments do not have policies restricting the religious practise of minorities.

The first [[Minister for Social Inclusion]] was Premier of South Australia [[Mike Rann]], who took the portfolio in 2004. Based on the UK's [[Social Exclusion Unit]], established by Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] in 1997, Rann established the Social Inclusion Initiative in 2002. It was headed by Monsignor [[David Cappo]] and was serviced by a unit within the department of Premier and Cabinet. Cappo sat on the Executive Committee of the [[South Australian Cabinet]] and was later appointed Social Inclusion Commissioner with wide powers to address social disadvantage.  Cappo was allowed to roam across agencies given that most social disadvantage has multiple causes necessitating a \"joined up\" rather than a single agency response.<ref>ABC News, 28 April 2006,\"Cappo appointed Social Inclusion Commissioner\"</ref> The Initiative drove a big investment by the South Australian Government in strategies to combat [[homelessness]], including establishing Common Ground, building high quality inner city apartments for \"rough sleeping\" homeless people, the Street to Home initiative<ref>Street to Home, sacommunity.org</ref> and the ICAN flexible learning program designed to improve school retention rates.

Mullaly (2007) describes how \"the personal is political\" and the need for recognizing that social problems are indeed connected with larger structures in society, causing various forms of oppression amongst individuals resulting in marginalization.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The New Structural Social Work|last=Mullaly|first=Bob|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0195419061|location=|pages=252\u2013286}}</ref> It is also important for the social worker to recognize the intersecting nature of oppression. A non-judgmental and unbiased attitude is necessary on the part of the social worker. The worker must begin to understand [[oppression]] and marginalization as a systemic problem, not the fault of the individual.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWorking under an anti-oppression perspective would then allow the social worker to understand the lived, subjective experiences of the individual, as well as their cultural, historical and social background. The worker should recognize the individual as political in the process of becoming a valuable member of society and the structural factors that contribute to oppression and marginalization (Mullaly, 2007).<ref name=\":0\" /> Social workers must take a firm stance on naming and labeling global forces that impact individuals and communities who are then left with no support, leading to marginalization or further marginalization from the society they once knew (George, P, SK8101, lecture, October 9, 2007).\n\nThe social worker should be constantly [[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexive]], work to raise the consciousness, [[Empowerment|empower]], and understand the lived subjective realities of individuals living in a fast-paced world, where fear and insecurity constantly subjugate the individual from the collective whole, perpetuating the dominant forces, while silencing the oppressed.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sakamoto|first=Izumi|last2=Pitner|first2=Ronald O.|date=June 2005|title=Use of Critical Consciousness in Anti-Oppressive Social Work Practice: Disentangling Power Dynamics at Personal and Structural Levels|url=https://academic.oup.com/bjsw/article-abstract/35/4/435/1716745|journal=The British Journal of Social Work|volume= 35| issue = 4|pages=435\u2013452|doi=10.1093/bjsw/bch190}}</ref>\n\nSome individuals and groups who are not professional social workers build relationships with marginalized persons by providing [[relational care]] and support, for example, through [[homeless ministry]].

In Italy, \"''esclusione sociale''\" is defined as [[poverty]] combined with [[social alienation]], by the [[statute]] n. 328 (11-8-2000), that instituted a state investigation commission named \"''Commissione di indagine sull'Esclusione Sociale''\" (CIES) to make an annual report to the government on legally expected issues of social exclusion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lavoro.gov.it/Lavoro/CIES/|title=''Commissione di Indagine sull'Esclusione Sociale'', accessed February 07, 2013|website=lavoro.gov.it|accessdate=22 October 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117133555/http://www.lavoro.gov.it/Lavoro/CIES/|archivedate=17 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]], a document on [[international human rights instruments]] affirms that \"[[extreme poverty]] and social exclusion constitute a violation of [[human dignity]] and that urgent steps are necessary to achieve better knowledge of extreme poverty and its causes, including those related to the program of development, in order to promote the human rights of the poorest, and to put an end to extreme poverty and social exclusion and promote the enjoyment of the fruits of social progress.
