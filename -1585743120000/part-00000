The copyright holder is typically the work's creator, or a publisher or other business to whom copyright has been assigned. Copyright holders routinely invoke legal and technological measures to prevent and penalize copyright infringement.\n\nCopyright infringement disputes are usually resolved through direct negotiation, a [[notice and take down]] process, or litigation in [[civil court]]. Egregious or large-scale commercial infringement, especially when it involves [[counterfeit]]ing, is sometimes prosecuted via the [[criminal justice]] system. Shifting public expectations, advances in digital technology, and the increasing reach of the Internet have led to such widespread, anonymous infringement that copyright-dependent industries now focus less on pursuing individuals who seek and share copyright-protected content online, and more on expanding copyright law to recognize and penalize, as indirect infringers, the service providers and software distributors who are said to facilitate and encourage individual acts of infringement by others.\n\nEstimates of the actual economic impact of copyright infringement vary widely and depend on many factors. Nevertheless, copyright holders, industry representatives, and legislators have long characterized copyright infringement as piracy or theft \u2013 language which some U.S. courts now regard as [[pejorative]] or otherwise contentious.<ref name=Dowling /><ref name=Hotfile_TF>{{Cite web\n  | title = MPAA Banned From Using Piracy and Theft Terms in Hotfile Trial\n  | accessdate = November 30, 2013\n  | url = http://torrentfreak.com/mpaa-banned-from-using-piracy-and-theft-terms-in-hotfile-trial-131129/| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131130144431/http://torrentfreak.com/mpaa-banned-from-using-piracy-and-theft-terms-in-hotfile-trial-131129/| archivedate= 30 November 2013| url-status= live| date = 2013-11-29\n }}</ref><ref name=Hotfile_TD>{{Cite web\n  | title = MPAA Banned From Using Piracy and Theft Terms in Hotfile Trial\n  | accessdate = November 30, 2013\n  | url = http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20131130/15263725410/surprise-mpaa-told-it-cant-use-terms-piracy-theft-stealing-during-hotfile-trial.shtml| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131203072723/http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20131130/15263725410/surprise-mpaa-told-it-cant-use-terms-piracy-theft-stealing-during-hotfile-trial.shtml| archivedate= 3 December 2013| url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n== Terminology ==\nThe terms ''piracy'' and ''theft'' are often associated with copyright infringement.<ref name=\"Cara\" /><ref name=\"Nick\">{{cite web|title=Game of Thrones: Another case for piracy|url=http://www.abc.net.au/technology/articles/2014/04/08/3980980.htm|work=ABC technology+games|publisher=ABC|accessdate=21 April 2014|author=Nick Ross|date=8 April 2014}}</ref> The original meaning of ''[[wikt:piracy|piracy]]'' is \"robbery or illegal violence at sea\",<ref>{{cite web|title=piracy|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/piracy?s=t|work=Dictionary.com|publisher=Dictionary.com, LLC|accessdate=21 April 2014|year=2014}}</ref> but the term has been in use for centuries as a synonym for acts of copyright infringement.<ref name=\"Dekker\">T.

When this outsourced litigator appears to have no intention of taking any copyright infringement cases to trial, but rather only takes them just far enough through the legal system to identify and exact settlements from suspected infringers, critics commonly refer to the party as a \"[[copyright troll]]\".

[[Misdemeanor]] infringement has a very low threshold in terms of number of copies and the value of the infringed works.\n\nThe [[Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement|ACTA trade agreement]], signed in May 2011 by the United States, Japan, and the EU, requires that its parties add criminal penalties, including incarceration and fines, for copyright and trademark infringement, and obligated the parties to actively police for infringement.<ref name=Xuan_p211 /><ref name=Bitton>Miriam Bitton (2012) [http://www.law.northwestern.edu/jclc/backissues/v102/n1/1021_67.Bitton.pdf Rethinking the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement's Criminal Copyright Enforcement Measures] The Journal of Criminal Law & Criminology 102(1):67\u2013117</ref><ref>{{cite web| title = The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement&nbsp;\u2013 Summary of Key Elements Under Discussion| work = transparency paper| publisher = Swiss federation of Intellectual Property| date = November 2009| url = https://www.ige.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/Juristische_Infos/e/transparency_paper.pdf| accessdate = 8 June 2010 }}</ref>\n\n''[[United States v.

Maximum penalties can be five years in [[prison]] and up to $250,000 in [[Fine (penalty)|fines]]. The NET Act also raised [[statutory damages for copyright infringement|statutory damages]] by 50%.

The Directive was not intended to legitimize file-sharing, but rather the common practice of [[space shifting]] copyright-protected content from a legally purchased [[compact disc|CD]] (for example) to certain kinds of devices and media, provided rights holders are compensated and no copy protection measures are circumvented. Rights-holder compensation takes various forms, depending on the country, but is generally either a levy on \"recording\" devices and media, or a tax on the content itself. In some countries, such as Canada, the applicability of such laws to copying onto general-purpose storage devices like computer hard drives, portable media players, and phones, for which no levies are collected, has been the subject of debate and further efforts to reform copyright law.\n\nIn some countries, the personal copying exemption explicitly requires that the content being copied was obtained legitimately \u2013 i.e., from authorized sources, not file-sharing networks. Other countries, such as the Netherlands, make no such distinction; the exemption there had been assumed, even by the government, to apply to any such copying, even from file-sharing networks. However, in April 2014, the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]] ruled that \"national legislation which makes no distinction between private copies made from lawful sources and those made from counterfeited or pirated sources cannot be tolerated.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2014-04/cp140058en.pdf | date=April 10, 2014 |title=The amount of the levy payable for making private copies of a protected work may not take unlawful reproductions into account |publisher=Court of Justice of the European Union}}</ref>\n\n==== Legality of uploading ====\nAlthough downloading or other private copying is sometimes permitted, public distribution \u2013 by uploading or otherwise offering to share copyright-protected content \u2013 remains illegal in most, if not all countries. For example, in Canada, even though it was once legal to download any copyrighted file as long as it was for noncommercial use, it was still illegal to distribute the copyrighted files (e.g. by uploading them to a [[P2P network]]).<ref>{{cite news|date=2003-12-12|url=http://news.cnet.com/Canada+deems+P2P+downloading+legal/2100-1025_3-5121479.html?tag=st.rc.targ_mb\n|title=Canada deems P2P downloading legal|accessdate=2012-12-27|publisher=CNET News}}</ref>\n\n==== Relaxed penalties ====\nSome countries, like Canada and Germany, have limited the penalties for non-commercial copyright infringement. For example, Germany has passed a bill to limit the fine for individuals accused of sharing movies and series to \u20ac800-900. Canada's [[Copyright Modernization Act]] claims that statutory damages for non-commercial copyright infringement are capped at C$5,000 but this only applies to copies that have been made without the breaking of any \"digital lock\". However, this only applies to \"bootleg distribution\" and not non-commercial use.<ref>For a discussion, see [http://copyright.infringementadvisor.com/2012/11/5000-cap-on-non-commercial-copyright.html Copyright Infringement Advisor] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413150715/http://copyright.infringementadvisor.com/2012/11/5000-cap-on-non-commercial-copyright.html |date=2014-04-13 }} : ''Cap on Non-Commercial Copyright Damages''</ref>\n\n=== DMCA and anti-circumvention laws ===\nTitle I of the U.S. [[DMCA]], the [[WIPO Copyright and Performances and Phonograms Treaties Implementation Act]] has provisions that prevent persons from \"circumvent[ing] a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work\".

The first laws on online intermediaries' liability were passed from the mid-1990s onwards.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nThe debate has shifted away from questions about liability for specific content, including that which may infringe copyright, towards whether online intermediaries should be ''generally'' responsible for content accessible through their services or infrastructure.<ref>{{cite web| last = Edwards| first = Lilian | last2 = Waelde| first2 = Charlotte| title = Online Intermediaries and Liability for Copyright Infringement| work = Keynote paper at WIPO Workshop on Online Intermediaries and Liability for Copyright, Geneva| publisher = World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO)| year = 2005| page = 5| url = http://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/1842/2305/1/wipo-onlineintermediaries.pdf| accessdate =1 September 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (1998) and the European [[E-Commerce Directive]] (2000) provide online intermediaries with limited statutory immunity from liability for copyright infringement. Online intermediaries hosting content that infringes copyright are not liable, so long as they do not know about it and take actions once the infringing content is brought to their attention. In U.S. law this is characterized as \"[[Safe harbor (law)|safe harbor]]\" provisions. Under European law, the governing principles for Internet Service Providers are \"mere conduit\", meaning that they are neutral 'pipes' with no knowledge of what they are carrying; and 'no obligation to monitor' meaning that they cannot be given a general mandate by governments to monitor content. These two principles are a barrier for certain forms of online copyright enforcement and they were the reason behind an attempt to amend the European [[Telecoms Package]] in 2009 to support new measures against copyright infringement.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Horten| first = Monica | title = The Copyright Enforcement Enigma&nbsp;\u2013 Internet Politics and the Telecoms Package | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | year = 2012| pages = 104\u2013106| url = http://www.palgrave.com/products/title.aspx?PID=526246| isbn =978-0-230-32171-7}}</ref>\n\n==== Peer-to-peer issues ====\n[[Peer-to-peer file sharing]] intermediaries have been denied access to safe harbor provisions in relation to copyright infringement.

These intermediaries may include the author, publishers and marketers of [[peer-to-peer]] networking software, and the websites that allow users to download such software. In the case of the BitTorrent protocol, intermediaries may include the [[torrent tracker]] and any websites or search engines which facilitate access to torrent files. Torrent files do not contain copyrighted content, but they may make reference to files that do, and they may point to trackers which coordinate the sharing of those files. Some torrent indexing and search sites, such as The Pirate Bay, now encourage the use of [[magnet URI scheme|magnet links]], instead of direct links to torrent files, creating another layer of indirection; using such links, torrent files are obtained from other peers, rather than from a particular website.\n\nSince the late 1990s, copyright holders have taken legal actions against a number of peer-to-peer intermediaries, such as pir, [[Grokster]], [[eMule]], [[SoulSeek]], [[BitTorrent (company)|BitTorrent]] and [[Limewire]], and case law on the liability of Internet service providers (ISPs) in relation to copyright infringement has emerged primarily in relation to these cases.<ref>{{cite web| last = Edwards| first = Lilian | last2 = Waelde| first2 = Charlotte| title = Online Intermediaries and Liability for Copyright Infringement| work = Keynote paper at WIPO Workshop on Online Intermediaries and Liability for Copyright, Geneva| publisher = World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO)| year = 2005| page = 7| url = http://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/1842/2305/1/wipo-onlineintermediaries.pdf| accessdate =1 September 2010}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, whether and to what degree any of these types of intermediaries have secondary liability is the subject of ongoing litigation. The decentralised structure of [[peer-to-peer networks]], in particular, does not sit easily with existing laws on online intermediaries' liability. The BitTorrent protocol established an entirely decentralised network architecture in order to distribute large files effectively. Recent developments in peer-to-peer technology towards more complex network configurations are said to have been driven by a desire to avoid liability as intermediaries under existing laws.<ref>{{cite web| last = Edwards| first = Lilian | last2 = Waelde| first2 = Charlotte| title = Online Intermediaries and Liability for Copyright Infringement| work = Keynote paper at WIPO Workshop on Online Intermediaries and Liability for Copyright, Geneva| publisher = World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO)| year = 2005| page = 9| url = http://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/1842/2305/1/wipo-onlineintermediaries.pdf| accessdate =1 September 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Limitations ==\nCopyright law does not grant authors and publishers absolute control over the use of their work.

POSAR, with its added features and additional facilities, offers something more to the legal and the judicial domain than what the AFC test offers. These additional features and facilities make the test more sensitive to the technical and legal requirements of software copyright infringement.\n\n== Preventive measures ==\nThe BSA outlined four strategies that governments can adopt to reduce software piracy rates in its 2011 piracy study results:\n\n* \"Increase public education and raise awareness about software piracy and IP rights in cooperation with industry and law enforcement.\"\n* \"Modernize protections for software and other copyrighted materials to keep pace with new innovations such as cloud computing and the proliferation of networked mobile devices.\"\n* \"Strengthen enforcement of IP laws with dedicated resources, including specialized enforcement units, training for law enforcement and judiciary officials, improved cross-border cooperation among law enforcement agencies, and fulfillment of obligations under the World Trade Organization's Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS).\"\n* \"Lead by example by using only fully licensed software, implementing software asset management (SAM) programs, and promoting the use of legal software in state-owned enterprises, and among all contractors and suppliers.\"<ref name=\"Study\" />\n\n=== Legal ===\nCorporations and legislatures take different types of preventive measures to deter copyright infringement, with much of the focus since the early 1990s being on preventing or reducing digital methods of infringement. Strategies include education, civil & criminal legislation, and international agreements,<ref name=\"Gopal\">Ram D. Gopal and G. Lawrence Sanders. \"International Software Piracy: Analysis of Key Issues and Impacts.\" Information Systems Research 9, no. 4 (December 1998): 380\u2013397.</ref> as well as publicizing anti-piracy litigation successes and imposing forms of digital media copy protection, such as controversial [[digital rights management|DRM]] technology and [[anti-circumvention]] laws, which limit the amount of control consumers have over the use of products and content they have purchased.\n\nLegislatures have reduced infringement by narrowing the scope of what is considered infringing. Aside from upholding international copyright treaty obligations to provide general limitations and exceptions,<ref name=Berne10 /> nations have enacted compulsory licensing laws applying specifically to digital works and uses. For example, in the U.S., the DMCA, an implementation of the 1996 [[WIPO Copyright Treaty]], considers digital transmissions of audio recordings to be licensed as long as a designated copyright collective's royalty and reporting requirements are met.<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode|17|514(f)\u2013(g)}}; see [[SoundExchange]].</ref> The DMCA also provides safe harbor for digital service providers whose users are suspected of copyright infringement, thus reducing the likelihood that the providers themselves will be considered directly infringing.<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode|17|512(a)\u2013(d)}}; see [[Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act]].</ref>\n\nSome copyright owners voluntarily reduce the scope of what is considered infringement by employing relatively permissive, \"open\" licensing strategies: rather than privately negotiating license terms with individual users who must first seek out the copyright owner and ask for permission, the copyright owner publishes and distributes the work with a prepared license that anyone can use, as long as they adhere to certain conditions.

In one decision, US District Court Judge [[James Parker Jones|James P.

A [[Jupiter Research]] study in 2000 found that \"Napster users were 45 percent more likely to have increased their music purchasing habits than online music fans who don't use the software were.\"<ref>Aram Sinnreich, \"Digital Music Subscriptions: Post-Napster Product Formats,\" Jupiter Research (2000).</ref> This indicated that users of peer-to-peer sharing did not hurt the profits of the music industry, but in fact may have increased it.\n\nProfessor Aram Sinnreich, in his book ''The Piracy Crusade'', states that the connection between declining music sales and the creation of peer to peer file sharing sites such as Napster is tenuous, based on correlation rather than causation. He argues that the industry at the time was undergoing artificial expansion, what he describes as a \"'perfect bubble'\u2014a confluence of economic, political, and technological forces that drove the aggregate value of music sales to unprecedented heights at the end of the twentieth century\".\n\nSinnreich cites multiple causes for the [[economic bubble]], including the CD format replacement cycle; the shift from music specialty stores to wholesale suppliers of music and 'minimum advertised pricing'; and the economic expansion of 1991\u20132001. He believes that with the introduction of new digital technologies, the bubble burst, and the industry suffered as a result.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Piracy Crusade: How the Music Industry's War on Sharing Destroys Markets and Erodes Civil Liberties|last=Sinnreich|first=Aram|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|year=2013|isbn=978-1-62534-052-8|location=|pages=94\u2013118}}</ref>\n\n=== Economic impact of infringement in emerging markets ===\nThe 2011 Business Software Alliance Piracy Study Standard, estimates the total commercial value of illegally copied software to be at $59 billion in 2010, with emerging markets accounting for $31.9 billion, over half of the total. Furthermore, mature markets for the first time received less PC shipments than emerging economies in 2010. In addition with software infringement rates of 68 percent comparing to 24 percent of mature markets, emerging markets thus possess the majority of the global increase in the commercial value of counterfeit software.

The copyright holder is typically the work's creator, or a publisher or other business to whom copyright has been assigned. Copyright holders routinely invoke legal and technological measures to prevent and penalize copyright infringement.\n\nCopyright infringement disputes are usually resolved through direct negotiation, a [[notice and take down]] process, or litigation in [[civil court]]. Egregious or large-scale commercial infringement, especially when it involves [[counterfeit]]ing, is sometimes prosecuted via the [[criminal justice]] system. Shifting public expectations, advances in digital technology, and the increasing reach of the Internet have led to such widespread, anonymous infringement that copyright-dependent industries now focus less on pursuing individuals who seek and share copyright-protected content online, and more on expanding copyright law to recognize and penalize, as indirect infringers, the service providers and software distributors who are said to facilitate and encourage individual acts of infringement by others.\n\nEstimates of the actual economic impact of copyright infringement vary widely and depend on many factors. Nevertheless, copyright holders, industry representatives, and legislators have long characterized copyright infringement as piracy or theft \u2013 language which some U.S. courts now regard as [[pejorative]] or otherwise contentious.<ref name=Dowling /><ref name=Hotfile_TF>{{Cite web\n  | title = MPAA Banned From Using Piracy and Theft Terms in Hotfile Trial\n  | accessdate = November 30, 2013\n  | url = http://torrentfreak.com/mpaa-banned-from-using-piracy-and-theft-terms-in-hotfile-trial-131129/| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131130144431/http://torrentfreak.com/mpaa-banned-from-using-piracy-and-theft-terms-in-hotfile-trial-131129/| archivedate= 30 November 2013| url-status= live| date = 2013-11-29\n }}</ref><ref name=Hotfile_TD>{{Cite web\n  | title = MPAA Banned From Using Piracy and Theft Terms in Hotfile Trial\n  | accessdate = November 30, 2013\n  | url = http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20131130/15263725410/surprise-mpaa-told-it-cant-use-terms-piracy-theft-stealing-during-hotfile-trial.shtml| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131203072723/http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20131130/15263725410/surprise-mpaa-told-it-cant-use-terms-piracy-theft-stealing-during-hotfile-trial.shtml| archivedate= 3 December 2013| url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n== Terminology ==\nThe terms ''piracy'' and ''theft'' are often associated with copyright infringement.<ref name=\"Cara\" /><ref name=\"Nick\">{{cite web|title=Game of Thrones: Another case for piracy|url=http://www.abc.net.au/technology/articles/2014/04/08/3980980.htm|work=ABC technology+games|publisher=ABC|accessdate=21 April 2014|author=Nick Ross|date=8 April 2014}}</ref> The original meaning of ''[[wikt:piracy|piracy]]'' is \"robbery or illegal violence at sea\",<ref>{{cite web|title=piracy|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/piracy?s=t|work=Dictionary.com|publisher=Dictionary.com, LLC|accessdate=21 April 2014|year=2014}}</ref> but the term has been in use for centuries as a synonym for acts of copyright infringement.<ref name=\"Dekker\">T.

The Directive was not intended to legitimize file-sharing, but rather the common practice of [[space shifting]] copyright-protected content from a legally purchased [[compact disc|CD]] (for example) to certain kinds of devices and media, provided rights holders are compensated and no copy protection measures are circumvented. Rights-holder compensation takes various forms, depending on the country, but is generally either a levy on \"recording\" devices and media, or a tax on the content itself. In some countries, such as Canada, the applicability of such laws to copying onto general-purpose storage devices like computer hard drives, portable media players, and phones, for which no levies are collected, has been the subject of debate and further efforts to reform copyright law.\n\nIn some countries, the personal copying exemption explicitly requires that the content being copied was obtained legitimately \u2013 i.e., from authorized sources, not file-sharing networks. Other countries, such as the Netherlands, make no such distinction; the exemption there had been assumed, even by the government, to apply to any such copying, even from file-sharing networks. However, in April 2014, the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]] ruled that \"national legislation which makes no distinction between private copies made from lawful sources and those made from counterfeited or pirated sources cannot be tolerated.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2014-04/cp140058en.pdf | date=April 10, 2014 |title=The amount of the levy payable for making private copies of a protected work may not take unlawful reproductions into account |publisher=Court of Justice of the European Union}}</ref>\n\n==== Legality of uploading ====\nAlthough downloading or other private copying is sometimes permitted, public distribution \u2013 by uploading or otherwise offering to share copyright-protected content \u2013 remains illegal in most, if not all countries. For example, in Canada, even though it was once legal to download any copyrighted file as long as it was for noncommercial use, it was still illegal to distribute the copyrighted files (e.g. by uploading them to a [[P2P network]]).<ref>{{cite news|date=2003-12-12|url=http://news.cnet.com/Canada+deems+P2P+downloading+legal/2100-1025_3-5121479.html?tag=st.rc.targ_mb\n|title=Canada deems P2P downloading legal|accessdate=2012-12-27|publisher=CNET News}}</ref>\n\n==== Relaxed penalties ====\nSome countries, like Canada and Germany, have limited the penalties for non-commercial copyright infringement. For example, Germany has passed a bill to limit the fine for individuals accused of sharing movies and series to \u20ac800-900. Canada's [[Copyright Modernization Act]] claims that statutory damages for non-commercial copyright infringement are capped at C$5,000 but this only applies to copies that have been made without the breaking of any \"digital lock\". However, this only applies to \"bootleg distribution\" and not non-commercial use.<ref>For a discussion, see [http://copyright.infringementadvisor.com/2012/11/5000-cap-on-non-commercial-copyright.html Copyright Infringement Advisor] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413150715/http://copyright.infringementadvisor.com/2012/11/5000-cap-on-non-commercial-copyright.html |date=2014-04-13 }} : ''Cap on Non-Commercial Copyright Damages''</ref>\n\n=== DMCA and anti-circumvention laws ===\nTitle I of the U.S. [[DMCA]], the [[WIPO Copyright and Performances and Phonograms Treaties Implementation Act]] has provisions that prevent persons from \"circumvent[ing] a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work\".

The first laws on online intermediaries' liability were passed from the mid-1990s onwards.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nThe debate has shifted away from questions about liability for specific content, including that which may infringe copyright, towards whether online intermediaries should be ''generally'' responsible for content accessible through their services or infrastructure.<ref>{{cite web| last = Edwards| first = Lilian | last2 = Waelde| first2 = Charlotte| title = Online Intermediaries and Liability for Copyright Infringement| work = Keynote paper at WIPO Workshop on Online Intermediaries and Liability for Copyright, Geneva| publisher = World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO)| year = 2005| page = 5| url = http://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/1842/2305/1/wipo-onlineintermediaries.pdf| accessdate =1 September 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (1998) and the European [[E-Commerce Directive]] (2000) provide online intermediaries with limited statutory immunity from liability for copyright infringement. Online intermediaries hosting content that infringes copyright are not liable, so long as they do not know about it and take actions once the infringing content is brought to their attention. In U.S. law this is characterized as \"[[Safe harbor (law)|safe harbor]]\" provisions. Under European law, the governing principles for Internet Service Providers are \"mere conduit\", meaning that they are neutral 'pipes' with no knowledge of what they are carrying; and 'no obligation to monitor' meaning that they cannot be given a general mandate by governments to monitor content. These two principles are a barrier for certain forms of online copyright enforcement and they were the reason behind an attempt to amend the European [[Telecoms Package]] in 2009 to support new measures against copyright infringement.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Horten| first = Monica | title = The Copyright Enforcement Enigma&nbsp;\u2013 Internet Politics and the Telecoms Package | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | year = 2012| pages = 104\u2013106| url = http://www.palgrave.com/products/title.aspx?PID=526246| isbn =978-0-230-32171-7}}</ref>\n\n==== Peer-to-peer issues ====\n[[Peer-to-peer file sharing]] intermediaries have been denied access to safe harbor provisions in relation to copyright infringement.

These intermediaries may include the author, publishers and marketers of [[peer-to-peer]] networking software, and the websites that allow users to download such software. In the case of the BitTorrent protocol, intermediaries may include the [[torrent tracker]] and any websites or search engines which facilitate access to torrent files. Torrent files do not contain copyrighted content, but they may make reference to files that do, and they may point to trackers which coordinate the sharing of those files. Some torrent indexing and search sites, such as The Pirate Bay, now encourage the use of [[magnet URI scheme|magnet links]], instead of direct links to torrent files, creating another layer of indirection; using such links, torrent files are obtained from other peers, rather than from a particular website.\n\nSince the late 1990s, copyright holders have taken legal actions against a number of peer-to-peer intermediaries, such as pir, [[Grokster]], [[eMule]], [[SoulSeek]], [[BitTorrent (company)|BitTorrent]] and [[Limewire]], and case law on the liability of Internet service providers (ISPs) in relation to copyright infringement has emerged primarily in relation to these cases.<ref>{{cite web| last = Edwards| first = Lilian | last2 = Waelde| first2 = Charlotte| title = Online Intermediaries and Liability for Copyright Infringement| work = Keynote paper at WIPO Workshop on Online Intermediaries and Liability for Copyright, Geneva| publisher = World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO)| year = 2005| page = 7| url = http://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/1842/2305/1/wipo-onlineintermediaries.pdf| accessdate =1 September 2010}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, whether and to what degree any of these types of intermediaries have secondary liability is the subject of ongoing litigation. The decentralised structure of [[peer-to-peer networks]], in particular, does not sit easily with existing laws on online intermediaries' liability. The BitTorrent protocol established an entirely decentralised network architecture in order to distribute large files effectively. Recent developments in peer-to-peer technology towards more complex network configurations are said to have been driven by a desire to avoid liability as intermediaries under existing laws.<ref>{{cite web| last = Edwards| first = Lilian | last2 = Waelde| first2 = Charlotte| title = Online Intermediaries and Liability for Copyright Infringement| work = Keynote paper at WIPO Workshop on Online Intermediaries and Liability for Copyright, Geneva| publisher = World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO)| year = 2005| page = 9| url = http://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/1842/2305/1/wipo-onlineintermediaries.pdf| accessdate =1 September 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Limitations ==\nCopyright law does not grant authors and publishers absolute control over the use of their work.

Some of these limitations, especially regarding what qualifies as original, are embodied only in case law (judicial precedent), rather than in statutes.\n\nIn the U.S., for example, copyright case law contains a [[substantial similarity]] requirement to determine whether the work was copied. Likewise, courts may require computer software to pass an [[Abstraction-Filtration-Comparison test]] (AFC Test)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifosslr.org/ifosslr/article/download/30/54 |title=Copyright in Open Source Software&nbsp;\u2013 Understanding the Boundaries |publisher=Ifosslr.org |accessdate=2012-09-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.linux.com/news/feature-8-cores-budget-building-better-workstation/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213110414/http://www.linux.com/archive/feature/113252|url-status=dead|title=Feature: 8 Cores on a Budget- Building a Better Workstation|date=September 11, 2008|archivedate=February 13, 2010}}</ref> to determine if it is too abstract to qualify for protection, or too dissimilar to an original work to be considered infringing.

POSAR, with its added features and additional facilities, offers something more to the legal and the judicial domain than what the AFC test offers. These additional features and facilities make the test more sensitive to the technical and legal requirements of software copyright infringement.\n\n== Preventive measures ==\nThe BSA outlined four strategies that governments can adopt to reduce software piracy rates in its 2011 piracy study results:\n\n* \"Increase public education and raise awareness about software piracy and IP rights in cooperation with industry and law enforcement.\"\n* \"Modernize protections for software and other copyrighted materials to keep pace with new innovations such as cloud computing and the proliferation of networked mobile devices.\"\n* \"Strengthen enforcement of IP laws with dedicated resources, including specialized enforcement units, training for law enforcement and judiciary officials, improved cross-border cooperation among law enforcement agencies, and fulfillment of obligations under the World Trade Organization's Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS).\"\n* \"Lead by example by using only fully licensed software, implementing software asset management (SAM) programs, and promoting the use of legal software in state-owned enterprises, and among all contractors and suppliers.\"<ref name=\"Study\" />\n\n=== Legal ===\nCorporations and legislatures take different types of preventive measures to deter copyright infringement, with much of the focus since the early 1990s being on preventing or reducing digital methods of infringement. Strategies include education, civil & criminal legislation, and international agreements,<ref name=\"Gopal\">Ram D. Gopal and G. Lawrence Sanders. \"International Software Piracy: Analysis of Key Issues and Impacts.\" Information Systems Research 9, no. 4 (December 1998): 380\u2013397.</ref> as well as publicizing anti-piracy litigation successes and imposing forms of digital media copy protection, such as controversial [[digital rights management|DRM]] technology and [[anti-circumvention]] laws, which limit the amount of control consumers have over the use of products and content they have purchased.\n\nLegislatures have reduced infringement by narrowing the scope of what is considered infringing. Aside from upholding international copyright treaty obligations to provide general limitations and exceptions,<ref name=Berne10 /> nations have enacted compulsory licensing laws applying specifically to digital works and uses. For example, in the U.S., the DMCA, an implementation of the 1996 [[WIPO Copyright Treaty]], considers digital transmissions of audio recordings to be licensed as long as a designated copyright collective's royalty and reporting requirements are met.<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode|17|514(f)\u2013(g)}}; see [[SoundExchange]].</ref> The DMCA also provides safe harbor for digital service providers whose users are suspected of copyright infringement, thus reducing the likelihood that the providers themselves will be considered directly infringing.<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode|17|512(a)\u2013(d)}}; see [[Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act]].</ref>\n\nSome copyright owners voluntarily reduce the scope of what is considered infringement by employing relatively permissive, \"open\" licensing strategies: rather than privately negotiating license terms with individual users who must first seek out the copyright owner and ask for permission, the copyright owner publishes and distributes the work with a prepared license that anyone can use, as long as they adhere to certain conditions. This has the effect of reducing infringement \u2013 and the burden on courts \u2013 by simply permitting certain types of uses under terms that the copyright owner considers reasonable.

In one decision, US District Court Judge [[James Parker Jones|James P.

Daniel Dove; the decision, entered November 7, 2008, can be viewed at http://www.vawd.uscourts.gov/OPINIONS/JONES/207CR15REST.PDF</ref> indicating profit-loss estimates were likely extremely off.\n\nOther critics of industry estimates argue that those who use peer-to-peer sharing services, or practice \"piracy\" are actually more likely to pay for music. A [[Jupiter Research]] study in 2000 found that \"Napster users were 45 percent more likely to have increased their music purchasing habits than online music fans who don't use the software were.\"<ref>Aram Sinnreich, \"Digital Music Subscriptions: Post-Napster Product Formats,\" Jupiter Research (2000).</ref> This indicated that users of peer-to-peer sharing did not hurt the profits of the music industry, but in fact may have increased it.\n\nProfessor Aram Sinnreich, in his book ''The Piracy Crusade'', states that the connection between declining music sales and the creation of peer to peer file sharing sites such as Napster is tenuous, based on correlation rather than causation. He argues that the industry at the time was undergoing artificial expansion, what he describes as a \"'perfect bubble'\u2014a confluence of economic, political, and technological forces that drove the aggregate value of music sales to unprecedented heights at the end of the twentieth century\".\n\nSinnreich cites multiple causes for the [[economic bubble]], including the CD format replacement cycle; the shift from music specialty stores to wholesale suppliers of music and 'minimum advertised pricing'; and the economic expansion of 1991\u20132001. He believes that with the introduction of new digital technologies, the bubble burst, and the industry suffered as a result.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Piracy Crusade: How the Music Industry's War on Sharing Destroys Markets and Erodes Civil Liberties|last=Sinnreich|first=Aram|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|year=2013|isbn=978-1-62534-052-8|location=|pages=94\u2013118}}</ref>\n\n=== Economic impact of infringement in emerging markets ===\nThe 2011 Business Software Alliance Piracy Study Standard, estimates the total commercial value of illegally copied software to be at $59 billion in 2010, with emerging markets accounting for $31.9 billion, over half of the total. Furthermore, mature markets for the first time received less PC shipments than emerging economies in 2010. In addition with software infringement rates of 68 percent comparing to 24 percent of mature markets, emerging markets thus possess the majority of the global increase in the commercial value of counterfeit software.

The machine was based on [[open architecture]], and third-party suppliers sprang up to provide peripheral devices, expansion cards, and software. [[influence of the IBM PC on the personal computer market|IBM had a substantial influence]] on the personal computer market in standardizing a platform for personal computers, and \"IBM compatible\" became an important criterion for sales growth.

Later models followed in the trend: For example, the [[IBM Portable Personal Computer]], [[IBM Personal Computer XT|PC/XT]], and [[IBM Personal Computer/AT|PC AT]] are IBM machine types 5155, 5160, and 5170, respectively.<ref>Likewise, IBM's early PC video display monitors have similar numbers: The IBM Monochrome Display (IBM's [[Monochrome Display Adapter|MDA]] monitor) is machine type 5151, the IBM Color Display (their [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]] monitor) is machine type 5153, and the IBM Enhanced Color Display (their [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]] monitor)) is machine type 5154.<!-- These names for the IBM PC monitors are taken from the section headings of the IBM Personal Computer Options and Adapters Technical Reference manual. --></ref>\n\nFollowing SCAMP, the IBM [[Boca Raton, Florida]] Laboratory created several single-user computer design concepts to support Lowe's ongoing effort to convince IBM there was a strategic opportunity in the personal computer business. A selection of these early IBM design concepts created by Hardy is highlighted in the book ''DELETE: A Design History of Computer Vapourware''. One such concept in 1977, code-named Aquarius, is a working prototype utilizing advanced [[bubble memory]] cartridges.

The 801 processor was more than an order of magnitude more powerful than the [[Intel 8088]], and the operating system more advanced than the [[PC DOS 1.0]] operating system from [[Microsoft]]. Ruling out an in-house solution made the team's job much easier and may have avoided a delay in the schedule, but the ultimate consequences of this decision for IBM were far-reaching.\n\nIBM had recently developed the [[IBM System/23 Datamaster]] business microcomputer, which uses a processor and other chips from Intel; familiarity with them and the immediate availability of the 8088 was a reason for choosing it for the PC. The 62-pin expansion bus slots were designed to be similar to the Datamaster slots. Differences from the Datamaster include avoiding an [[all-in-one PC|all-in-one design]] while limiting the computer's size so that it fits on a standard desktop with the keyboard (also similar to the Datamaster's), and {{frac|5|1|4}}\" disk drives instead of 8\".

Some programs are time sensitive to a particular speed class. Older programs will not take advantage of newer higher-resolution and higher-color display standards, while some newer programs require newer display adapters.<!-- An example is Majhongg by Nels Anderson, which supports no less than EGA graphics -->  (Note that as the display adapter was an adapter card in all of these IBM models, newer display hardware could easily be, and often was, retrofitted to older models.)  A few programs, typically very early ones, are written for and require a specific version of the IBM PC BIOS ROM.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}  Most notably, [[BASICA]] which was dependent on the BIOS ROM had a sister program called [[GW-BASIC]] which supported more functions, was 100% backwards compatible and could run independently from the BIOS ROM.\n\n===Original PC===\n[[File:IMB PC-IMG 7271.jpg|thumb|IBM PC 5150]]\nThe [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]] video card, with a suitable modulator, could use an NTSC [[television]] set or an RGBi monitor for display; IBM's RGBi monitor was their display model 5153. The other option that was offered by IBM was an [[Monochrome Display Adapter|MDA]] and their [[IBM 5151|monochrome display model 5151]]. It was possible to install both an MDA and a CGA card and use both monitors concurrently<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seasip.info/VintagePC/dualhead.html|title=Dual-Head operation on vintage PCs|publisher=}}</ref> if supported by the application program. For example, [[AutoCAD]], [[Lotus 1-2-3]] and others allowed use of a CGA Monitor for graphics and a separate [[monochrome monitor]] for text menus. Some model 5150 PCs with CGA monitors and a printer port also included the MDA adapter by default, because IBM provided the MDA port and printer port on the same adapter card; it was in fact an MDA/printer port combo card.\n\nAlthough [[Compact Cassette|cassette tape]] was originally envisioned by IBM as a low-budget storage alternative, the most commonly used medium was the [[floppy disk]]. The 5150 was available with one or two {{frac|5|1|4}}\" floppy drives \u2013 with two drives the program disc(s) would be in drive A, while drive B would hold the disc(s) for working files; with one drive the user had to swap program and file discs into the single drive. For models without any drives or storage medium, IBM intended users to connect their own cassette recorder via the 5150's cassette socket. The cassette tape socket was physically the same [[DIN connector|DIN plug]] as the keyboard socket and next to it, but electrically completely different.\n\nA [[hard disk drive]] could not be installed into the 5150's system unit without changing to a higher-rated power supply (although later drives with lower power consumption have been known to work with the standard 63.5 Watt unit). The \"IBM 5161 Expansion Chassis\" came with its own power supply and one 10&nbsp;MB hard disk and allowed the installation of a second hard disk.<ref>Scott Mueller ''Upgrading and Repairing PCs, Second Edition'', Que Books, 1992, {{ISBN|0-88022-856-3}} page 48</ref> Without the expansion chassis perhaps one free slot remains after installing necessary cards,<ref name=\"freeze19851216\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cC8EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA43&pg=PA43#v=onepage&f=true | title=Leading Edge: Superior Value In IBM-PC Clone Market Contest | work=InfoWorld | date=1985-12-16 | accessdate=22 July 2014 | author=Freeze, Ken | pages=43}}</ref> as a working configuration requires that some of the slots be occupied by display, disk, and I/O adapters, as none of these were built into the 5150's motherboard; the only motherboard external connectors are the keyboard and cassette ports.The system unit has five expansion slots, and the expansion unit has eight; however, one of the system unit's slots and one of the expansion unit's slots have to be occupied by the Extender Card and Receiver Card, respectively, which are needed to connect the expansion unit to the system unit and make the expansion unit's other slots available, for a total of 11 slots.\n\nThe simple [[PC speaker]] sound hardware was also on board.\n\nThe original PC's maximum memory using IBM parts was 256&nbsp;[[Kilobyte|kB]], achievable through the installation of 64&nbsp;kB on the motherboard and three 64 kB expansion cards. The processor was an [[Intel 8088]] running at 4.77&nbsp;[[megahertz|MHz]], 4/3 the standard NTSC [[color burst]] frequency of 315/88&nbsp;=&nbsp;3.579{{Overline|54}}{{Efn|[[Repeating decimal#Notation|Repeating decimal notation]]}}&nbsp;MHz. (In early units, the Intel 8088 used was a 1978 version, later were 1978/81/2 versions of the Intel chip; second-sourced [[AMD]]s were used after 1983){{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}. Some owners replaced the 8088 with an [[NEC V20]] for a slight increase in processing speed and support for real mode 80186 instructions. The V20 gained its speed increase through the use of a hardware multiplier which the 8088 lacked. An [[Intel 8087]] [[coprocessor]] could also be added for hardware floating-point arithmetic.\n\nIBM sold the first IBM PCs in configurations with 16 or 64&nbsp;kB of [[random-access memory|RAM]] preinstalled using either nine or thirty-six 16-[[kilobit]] [[DRAM]] chips. (The ninth bit was used for [[parity bit|parity]] checking of memory.) In November 1982, the hardware was changed to allow the use of 64-Kbit chips (as opposed to the original 16-Kbit chips) - the same RAM configuration as the soon-to-be-released IBM XT. (64 kB in one bank, expandable to 256kB by populating the other three banks.)\n\nAlthough the TV-compatible video board, cassette port and [[Federal Communications Commission]] Class B certification were all aimed at making it a [[home computer]],{{r|bradley199009}} the original PC proved too expensive for the home market. At introduction, a PC with 64 kB of RAM and a single 5.25-inch floppy drive and monitor sold for {{nowrap|[[United States dollar|US $]]3,005}} ({{Inflation|US|3005|1981|fmt=eq}}), while the cheapest configuration ({{nowrap|US $1,565}}) that had no floppy drives, only 16&nbsp;kB RAM, and no monitor (again, under the expectation that users would connect their existing TV sets and cassette recorders) proved too unattractive and low-spec, even for its time (cf. footnotes to the above IBM PC range table).<ref>[http://www.tmworld.com/article/CA187350.html Whence Came the IBM PC Test and Measurement World] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217120019/http://www.tmworld.com/article/CA187350.html |date=2007-12-17 }}, retrieved March 2,</ref><ref>Gene Smart and Andrew Reinhardt, ''15 years of Bits, Bytes and Other Great Moments'', ''[[BYTE Magazine]]'', September 1990 pg. 382</ref> While the 5150 did not become a top selling home computer, its floppy-based configuration became an unexpectedly large success with businesses.\n\n===XT===\n{{Main|IBM Personal Computer XT}}\n\nThe \"IBM Personal Computer XT\", IBM model 5160, was introduced two years after the PC and featured a 10 megabyte hard drive. It had eight expansion slots but the same processor and clock speed as the PC. The XT had no cassette jack, but still had the Cassette Basic interpreter in ROMs.\n\nThe XT could take 256&nbsp;kB of memory on the main board (using 64&nbsp;kbit DRAM); later models were expandable to 640&nbsp;kB. The remaining 384 kilobytes of the 8088 address space (between 640 KB and 1 MB) were used for the BIOS ROM, adapter ROM and RAM space, including video RAM space. It was usually sold with a [[Monochrome Display Adapter]] (MDA) video card or a CGA video card.\n\nThe eight expansion slots were the same as the model 5150 but were spaced closer together. Although rare, a card designed for the 5150 could be wide enough to obstruct the adjacent slot in an XT.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.howard81.co.uk/upload/vcf/xt/newxt/xt_mainboard2.JPG|title=Howard81.co.uk|publisher=|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627010207/http://www.howard81.co.uk/upload/vcf/xt/newxt/xt_mainboard2.JPG|archive-date=2008-06-27|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.howard81.co.uk/upload/vcf/5150/5150_mainboard(highres).JPG|title=Howard81.co.uk|publisher=}}</ref>  Because of the spacing, an XT motherboard would not fit into a case designed for the PC motherboard, but the slots and peripheral cards were compatible. The XT expansion bus (later called \"8-bit [[Industry Standard Architecture]]\" (ISA) by competitors) was retained in the IBM AT, which added connectors for some slots to allow 16-bit transfers; 8-bit cards could be used in an AT.\n\n===XT/370===\n{{main|PC-based IBM-compatible mainframes}}\nThe \"IBM Personal Computer XT/370\" was an XT with three custom 8-bit cards: the processor card (370PC-P) contained a modified [[Motorola 68000]] chip, microcoded to execute [[System/370]] instructions, a second 68000 to handle bus arbitration and memory transfers, and a modified 8087 to emulate the S/370 [[floating point]] instructions. The second card (370PC-M) connected to the first and contained 512 kB of memory. The third card (PC3277-EM), was a 3270 terminal emulator necessary to install the system software for the VM/PC software to run the processors.\n\nThe computer booted into DOS, then ran the VM/PC Control Program.<ref>[http://www.corestore.org/XT370-1.jpg Corestore.org]</ref><ref>Muller, Guide to repairing and upgrading PCs 6th edition</ref>\n\n===PCjr===\n{{Main|IBM PCjr}}\nThe \"IBM PCjr\" was IBM's first attempt to enter the market for relatively inexpensive educational and home-use personal computers. The PCjr, IBM model number 4860, retained the IBM PC's 8088 CPU and BIOS interface for compatibility, but its cost and differences in the PCjr's architecture, as well as other design and implementation decisions (chief among these was the use of a \"chiclet\" keyboard, which was difficult to type with), eventually led to the PCjr, and the related [[IBM JX]], being commercial failures.\n\n===Portable===\n{{Main|IBM Portable Personal Computer}}\nThe \"IBM Portable Personal Computer\" 5155 model 68 was an early portable computer developed by IBM after the success of Compaq's suitcase-size portable machine (the Compaq Portable). It was released in February 1984, and was eventually replaced by the IBM Convertible.\n\nThe Portable was an XT motherboard, transplanted into a Compaq-style luggable case. The system featured 256 kilobytes of memory (expandable to 512&nbsp;KB), an added CGA card connected to an internal monochrome (amber) composite monitor, and one or two half-height 5.25\" 360&nbsp;KB floppy disk drives. Unlike the Compaq Portable, which used a dual-mode monitor and special display card, IBM used a stock CGA board and a composite monitor, which had lower resolution. It could however, display color if connected to an external monitor or television.\n\n===AT===\n{{Main|IBM Personal Computer/AT}}\n\nThe \"IBM Personal Computer/AT\" (model 5170), announced August 15, 1984, used an [[Intel 80286]] processor, originally running at 6&nbsp;MHz. It had a 16-[[bit]] ISA bus and 20&nbsp;MB [[hard drive]]. A faster model, running at 8&nbsp;MHz and sporting a 30-megabyte hard disk<ref>i.e. 33% more speed, 50% more disk space</ref> was introduced in 1986.<ref>PC Magazine, Sept. 30, 1986, pp. 179-184</ref>\n\nThe AT was designed to support multitasking; the new SysRq ([[system request]]) key, little noted and often overlooked, is part of this design, as is the 80286 itself, the first Intel 16-bit processor with multitasking features (i.e. the 80286 protected mode). IBM made some attempt at marketing the AT as a multi-user machine, but it sold mainly as a faster PC for power users. For the most part, IBM PC/ATs were used as more powerful DOS (single-tasking) personal computers, in the literal sense of the PC name.\n\nEarly PC/ATs were plagued with reliability problems, in part because of some software and hardware incompatibilities, but mostly related to the internal 20&nbsp;MB hard disk, and High Density Floppy Disk Drive.<ref>The opening sentence of an April 29, 1986 PC Magazine article reads \"If you own an IBM PC AT and your hard disk hasn't crashed yet, don't worry &ndash; it probably will.\" [https://web.archive.org/web/20121104075857/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-3760999.html highbeam.com] & [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P2-3760999.html encyclopedia.com] (the latter a Chicago Sun-Times article citing the PC Magazine story). IBM recovered, although with mixed comments, as noted in the Sept. 30, 1986 PC Magazine article, \"The Two Faces of IBM's 8-MHz AT,\" pp. 179 - 184.</ref>\n\nWhile some people blamed IBM's [[hard disk controller]] card and others blamed the hard disk manufacturer [[Computer Memories Inc.]] (CMI), the IBM controller card worked fine with other drives, including CMI's 33-MB model. The problems introduced doubt about the computer and, for a while, even about the 286 architecture in general, but after IBM replaced the 20&nbsp;MB CMI drives, the PC/AT proved reliable and became a lasting industry standard.\n\nIBM AT's Drive parameter table listed the CMI-33 as having 615 cylinders instead of the 640 the drive was designed with, as to make the size an even 30 MB. Those who re-used the drives mostly found that the 616th cylinder was bad due to it being used as a landing area.\n\n===AT/370===\nThe \"IBM Personal Computer AT/370\" was an AT with two custom 16-bit cards, running almost exactly the same setup as the XT/370.\n\n===Convertible===\n{{Main|IBM PC Convertible}}\nThe IBM PC Convertible, released April 3, 1986, was IBM's first laptop computer and was also the first IBM computer to utilize the 3.5\" floppy disk which went on to become the standard. Like modern laptops, it featured power management and the ability to run from batteries. It was the follow-up to the IBM Portable and was model number 5140. The concept and the design of the body was made by the German industrial designer [[Richard Sapper]].\n\nIt utilized an Intel 80c88 CPU (a CMOS version of the Intel 8088) running at 4.77&nbsp;MHz, 256 kB of RAM (expandable to 640 kB), dual 720 kB 3.5\" floppy drives, and a monochrome CGA-compatible LCD screen at a price of $2,000. It weighed {{convert|13|lb|kg}} and featured a built-in carrying handle.\n\nThe PC Convertible had expansion capabilities through a proprietary ISA bus-based port on the rear of the machine. Extension modules, including a small printer and a video output module, could be snapped into place. The machine could also take an internal modem, but there was no room for an internal hard disk.\n\n===Next-generation IBM PS/2===\nThe [[IBM PS/2]] line was introduced in 1987. The Model 30 at the bottom end of the lineup was very similar to earlier models; it used an 8086 processor and an ISA bus. The Model 30 was not \"IBM compatible\" in that it did not have standard 5.25-inch drive bays; it came with a 3.5-inch floppy drive and optionally a 3.5-inch-sized hard disk. Most models in the PS/2 line further departed from \"IBM compatible\" by replacing the ISA bus completely with [[Micro Channel architecture|Micro Channel Architecture]]. The MCA bus was not received well by the customer base for PC's, since it was proprietary to IBM. It was rarely implemented by any of the other PC-compatible makers. Eventually IBM would abandon this architecture entirely and return to the standard ISA bus.\n\n==Technology==\n\n===Electronics===\n[[File:IBM PC Motherboard (1981).jpg|thumb|Original IBM Personal Computer motherboard, IBM 5150. It has five expansion slots (an interface later called \"PC/XT-bus\" by IBM and \"8-bit [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]]\" by other manufacturers of compatible computers), and two DIN connectors for keyboard and cassette interface.]]\nThe main circuit board in a PC is called the [[motherboard]] (IBM terminology calls it a ''planar''). This mainly carries the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] and [[computer memory|RAM]], and has a [[computer bus|bus]] with slots for expansion cards. Also on the motherboard are the ROM subsystem, DMA and IRQ controllers, coprocessor socket, sound (PC speaker, tone generation) circuitry, and keyboard interface. The original PC also has a cassette interface.\n\nThe bus used in the original PC became very popular, and it was later named [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]]. It was originally known as the PC-bus or XT-bus; the term ''ISA'' arose later when industry leaders chose to continue manufacturing machines based on the IBM PC AT architecture rather than license the [[IBM Personal System/2|PS/2]] architecture and its [[Micro Channel architecture|Micro Channel]] bus from IBM. The XT-bus was then retroactively named ''8-bit ISA'' or ''XT ISA'', while the unqualified term ''ISA'' usually refers to the 16-bit AT-bus (as better defined in the ISA specifications). The AT-bus is an extension of the PC-/XT-bus and is in use to this day in computers for industrial use, where its relatively low speed, 5-volt signals, and relatively simple, straightforward design (all by year 2011 standards) give it technical advantages (e.g. noise immunity for reliability).\n\n[[File:KL Quadram Quadboard.jpg|right|thumb|Quadram Quadboard]]\nA monitor and any floppy or hard disk drives are connected to the motherboard through cables connected to graphics adapter and disk controller cards, respectively, installed in expansion slots. Each expansion slot on the motherboard has a corresponding opening in the back of the computer case through which the card can expose connectors; a blank metal cover plate covers this case opening (to prevent dust and debris intrusion and control airflow) when no expansion card is installed. Memory expansion beyond the amount installable on the motherboard was also done with boards installed in expansion slots, and I/O devices such as parallel, serial, or network ports were likewise installed as individual expansion boards. For this reason, it was easy to fill the five expansion slots of the PC, or even the eight slots of the XT, even without installing any special hardware. Companies like Quadram and AST addressed this with their popular multi-I/O cards which combine several peripherals on one adapter card that uses only one slot; Quadram offered the QuadBoard and AST the SixPak.\n\n[[Intel]] 8086 and [[Intel 8088|8088]]-based PCs require [[expanded memory]] (EMS) boards to work with more than 640&nbsp;kB of memory. (Though the 8088 can address one [[megabyte]] of memory, the last 384&nbsp;kB of that is used or reserved for the BIOS ROM, BASIC ROM, extension ROMs installed on adapter cards, and memory address space used by devices including display adapter RAM and even the 64&nbsp;kB EMS page frame itself.) The original IBM PC AT used an [[Intel 80286]] processor which can access up to 16&nbsp;MB of memory (though standard [[DOS]] applications cannot use more than one megabyte without using additional APIs). Intel 80286-based computers running under [[OS/2]] can work with the maximum memory.\n\n===Peripheral integrated circuits===\nThe set of peripheral chips selected for the original IBM PC defined the functionality of an IBM compatible. These became the de facto base for later [[application-specific integrated circuit]]s (ASICs) used in compatible products.\n\nThe original system chips were one [[Intel 8259]] programmable interrupt controller (PIC) (at I/O address {{nowrap|0x20}}), one [[Intel 8237]] direct memory access (DMA) controller (at I/O address {{nowrap|0x00}}), and an [[Intel 8253]] programmable interval timer (PIT) (at I/O address {{nowrap|0x40}}). The PIT provides the {{nowrap|18.2 Hz}} clock ticks, dynamic memory refresh timing, and can be used for speaker output;<ref>[http://www.arl.wustl.edu/~lockwood/class/cs306/lecture/l16.html wustl.edu - ECE306 Lecture 16] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724180117/http://www.arl.wustl.edu/~lockwood/class/cs306/lecture/l16.html |date=2011-07-24 }}</ref> one DMA channel is used to perform the memory refresh.\n\nThe mathematics [[coprocessor]] was the Intel [[x87#8087|8087]] using I/O address 0xF0. This was an option for users who needed extensive floating-point arithmetic, such as users of computer-aided drafting.\n\nThe IBM PC AT added a second, slave 8259 PIC (at I/O address {{nowrap|0xA0}}), a second 8237 DMA controller for 16-bit DMA (at I/O address {{nowrap|0xC0}}), a DMA address register (implemented with a 74LS612 IC) (at I/O address {{nowrap|0x80}}),<ref>The DMA address register extends the 16-bit transfer memory address capacity of the 8237 to 24 bits</ref> and a [[Motorola]] MC146818 [[real-time clock]] (RTC) with [[nonvolatile BIOS memory|nonvolatile memory]] (NVRAM) used for system configuration (replacing the DIP switches and jumpers used for this purpose in PC and PC/XT models (at I/O address {{nowrap|0x70}}).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece391/references/mc146818.pdf |title=illinois.edu - Real time clock plus RAM |access-date=May 20, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814010211/http://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece391/references/mc146818.pdf |archive-date=August 14, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> On expansion cards, the [[Intel 8255]] programmable peripheral interface (PPI) (at I/O addresses {{nowrap|0x378}} is used for parallel I/O controls the printer,<ref>[http://www.ctv.es/pckits/tutorial.html ctv.se - PC KITS-tutorial page (parallel port, joystick port)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728124053/http://www.ctv.es/pckits/tutorial.html |date=2011-07-28 }}</ref> and the [[8250 UART|8250]] universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter (UART) (at I/O address {{nowrap|0x3F8}} or {{nowrap|0x3E8}}) controls the serial communication at the (pseudo-)<ref>The IBM PC serial port is not strictly RS-232, since it uses TTL signal levels, whereas RS-232 requires signals of +/- 3 to 15 volts; some signal levels that are valid for a TTL high state, and all signal levels that represent a TTL low state, fall within the forbidden range of -3 to +3 volts for standard RS-232. (However, it is not difficult to design and construct a level converter that will convert between IBM serial port and standard RS-232 signals.)</ref> [[RS-232]] port.\n\n===Joystick port===\nIBM offered a [[Game port|Game Control Adapter]] for the PC,{{r|lemmons198110}} which supported analog joysticks similar to those on the Apple II. Although analog controls proved inferior for arcade-style games, they were an asset in certain other genres such as [[flight simulator]]s. The joystick port on the IBM PC supported two controllers, but required a Y-splitter cable to connect both at once. It remained the standard joystick interface on IBM compatibles until being replaced by [[USB]] during the 2000s.\n\n===Keyboard===\n{{main|IBM PC keyboard}}\n[[File:IBM_Model_F_XT.png|thumb|The original keyboard for the IBM 5150 and XT]]\n\nThe keyboard that came with the IBM 5150 was an extremely reliable and high-quality electronic keyboard originally developed in North Carolina for the Datamaster.{{r|bradley199009}} Each key was rated to be reliable to over 100 million keystrokes. For the IBM PC, a separate keyboard housing was designed with a novel usability feature that allowed users to adjust the keyboard angle for personal comfort. Compared with the keyboards of other small computers at the time, the [[IBM PC keyboard]] was far superior and played a significant role in establishing a high-quality impression. For example, the industrial design of the adjustable keyboard, together with the system unit, was recognized with a major design award.<ref name=ID/> ''[[Byte (magazine)|Byte]]'' magazine in the fall of 1981 went so far as to state that the keyboard was 50% of the reason to buy an IBM PC. The importance of the keyboard was definitely established when the 1983 [[IBM PCjr]] flopped, in very large part for having a much different and mediocre [[Chiclet keyboard]] that made a poor impression on customers. Oddly enough, the same thing almost happened to the original IBM PC when in early 1981 management seriously considered substituting a cheaper and lower quality keyboard. This mistake was narrowly avoided on the advice of one of the original development engineers.\n\nHowever, the original 1981 IBM PC 83-key [[computer keyboard|keyboard]] was criticized by typists for its non-standard placement of the {{Key press |[[Return key|Return]]}} and left {{Key press |[[Shift key|Shift]]}} keys, and because it did not have separate cursor and numeric pads that were popular on the pre-PC [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[VT100]] series video terminals. In 1982, [[Key Tronic]] introduced a 101-key PC keyboard, albeit not with the now-familiar layout. In 1984, IBM corrected the {{Key press |Return}} and left {{Key press |Shift}} keys on its AT keyboard, but shortened the {{Key press |[[Backspace key|Backspace]]}} key, making it harder to reach. In 1986, IBM introduced the 101 key [[Enhanced Keyboard]], which added the separate cursor and numeric key pads, relocated all the function keys and the {{Key press |[[Ctrl key|Ctrl]]}} keys, and the {{Key press |[[Esc key|Esc]]}} key was also relocated to the opposite side of the keyboard. The Enhanced Keyboard was an option for the PC XT/AT in 1986, both of which were also available with their original keyboards, and introduced the key layout that's still the industry standard.\n\nAnother feature of the original keyboard is the relatively loud \"click\" sound each key made when pressed. Since typewriter users were accustomed to keeping their eyes on the hardcopy they were typing from and had come to rely on the mechanical sound that was made as each character was typed onto the paper to ensure that they had pressed the key hard enough (and only once), the PC keyboard used a keyswitch that produced a click and tactile bump intended to provide that same reassurance.\n\nThe IBM PC keyboard is very robust and flexible. The low-level interface for each key is the same: each key sends a signal when it is pressed and another signal when it is released. An integrated microcontroller in the keyboard scans the keyboard and encodes a \"scan code\" and \"release code\" for each key as it is pressed and released separately. Any key can be used as a shift key, and a large number of keys can be held down simultaneously and separately sensed. The controller in the keyboard handles typematic operation, issuing periodic repeat scan codes for a depressed key and then a single release code when the key is finally released.\n\nAn \"IBM PC compatible\" may have a keyboard that does not recognize every key combination a true IBM PC does, such as shifted cursor keys. In addition, the \"compatible\" vendors sometimes used proprietary keyboard interfaces, preventing the keyboard from being replaced.\n\nAlthough the PC/XT and AT used the same style of keyboard connector, the low-level protocol for reading the keyboard was different between these two series. The AT keyboard uses a bidirectional interface which allows the computer to send commands to the keyboard. An AT keyboard could not be used in an XT, nor the reverse. Third-party keyboard manufacturers provided a switch on some of their keyboards to select either the AT-style or XT-style protocol for the keyboard.\n\n{{See also|Keyboard layout}}\n\n===Character set===\nThe original IBM PC used the 7-bit [[ASCII]] alphabet as its basis, but extended it to 8 bits with nonstandard character codes. This character set was not suitable for some international applications, and soon a veritable cottage industry emerged providing variants of the original character set in various national variants. In IBM tradition, these variants were called [[code page]]s. These codings are now obsolete, having been replaced by more systematic and standardized forms of character coding, such as [[ISO 8859-1]], [[Windows-1251]] and [[Unicode]]. The original character set is known as [[code page 437]].\n\n===Storage media===\n\n====Cassette tape====\n{{Main|IBM cassette tape}}\n\nIBM equipped the model 5150 with a cassette port for connecting a [[Compact cassette#Data recording|cassette]] drive and assumed that home users would purchase the low-end model and save files to cassette tapes as was typical of home computers of the time. However, adoption of the floppy- and monitor-less configuration was low; few (if any) IBM PCs left the factory without a floppy disk drive installed. Also, DOS was not available on cassette tape, only on floppy disks (hence \"Disk Operating System\"). 5150s with just external cassette recorders for storage could only use the built-in ROM BASIC as their operating system. As DOS saw increasing adoption, the incompatibility of DOS programs with PCs that used only cassettes for storage made this configuration even less attractive. The ROM BIOS supported cassette operations.\n\n[[IBM Cassette tape|The IBM PC cassette interface]] encodes data using frequency modulation with a variable data rate. Either a one or a zero is represented by a single cycle of a square wave, but the square wave frequencies differ by a factor of two, with ones having the lower frequency. Therefore, the bit periods for zeros and ones also differ by a factor of two, with the unusual effect that a data stream with more zeros than ones will use less tape (and time) than an equal-length (in bits) data stream containing more ones than zeros, or equal numbers of each.\n\nIBM also had an exclusive license agreement with Microsoft to include BASIC in the ROM of the PC; clone manufacturers could not have ROM BASIC on their machines, but it also became a problem as the XT, AT, and PS/2 eliminated the cassette port and IBM was still required to install the (now useless) BASIC with them. The agreement finally expired in 1991 when Microsoft replaced BASICA/GW-BASIC with [[QBASIC]]. The main core BASIC resided in ROM and \"linked\" up with the RAM-resident BASIC.COM/BASICA.COM included with PC DOS (they provided disk support and other extended features not present in ROM BASIC). Because BASIC was over 50 kB in size, this served a useful function during the first three years of the PC when machines only had 64\u2013128 kB of memory, but became less important by 1985. For comparison, clone makers such as Compaq were forced to include a version of BASIC that resided entirely in RAM.\n\n====Floppy diskettes====\n[[File:IBM Floppy Drive With DOS.jpg|right|thumb|Tandon 5.25-inch [[Disk storage|Diskette Drive]] with a partially inserted double-density diskette containing DOS 1.1.]]\n\nThe first IBM 5150 PCs had two 5.25-inch 160&nbsp;KiB single sided double density (SSDD) [[floppy disk]] drives. As two heads drives became available in the spring of 1982, later IBM PC and compatible computers could read 320&nbsp;KiB double sided double density (DSDD) disks with software support of MS-DOS&nbsp;1.25 and higher. The same type of physical diskette media could be used for both drives but a disk formatted for double-sided use could not be read on a single-sided drive. PC DOS&nbsp;2.0 added support for 180&nbsp;KiB and 360&nbsp;KiB SSDD and DSDD floppy disks, using the same physical media again.\n\nThe disks were [[Modified Frequency Modulation]] (MFM) coded in 512-byte sectors, and were soft-sectored.<ref>{{cite book|last=IBM|title=Technical Reference: Personal Computer Hardware Reference Library|publisher=IBM Corp.|date=July 1982|edition=Revised|pages=2\u201393|id=6025008}}</ref> They contained 40 tracks per side at the 48 track per inch (TPI) density,<ref>Sometimes the tracks were also referred as cylinders, which is technically correct and analogous to hard drive cylinders. One floppy disk track equaled one cylinder, however with double-sided floppies, only the first side's cylinder numbers were identical to the track numbers; on the second side, the cylinders 1-40 corresponded to tracks 41-80 of the formatted floppy.<!-- Does anyone know whether SSDD drives could read files stored on the first 40 tracks of a DSDD formatted floppy?--></ref> and initially were formatted to contain eight sectors per track. This meant that SSDD disks initially had a formatted capacity of 160&nbsp;kB,<ref>163,840 bytes, i.e. 512 bytes \u00d7 8 sectors \u00d7 40 tracks on the one side used</ref> while DSDD disks had a capacity of 320&nbsp;kB.<ref>327,680 bytes, i.e. 512 bytes \u00d7 8 sectors \u00d7 40 tracks \u00d7 2 sides</ref> However, the PC DOS&nbsp;2.0 and later operating systems allowed formatting the disks with nine sectors per track. This yielded a formatted capacity of 180&nbsp;kB with SSDD disks/drives,<ref>184,320 bytes, i.e. 512 bytes \u00d7 9 sectors \u00d7 40 tracks on the one side used</ref> and 360 kB with DSDD disks/drives.<ref>368,640 bytes, i.e. 512 bytes \u00d7 9 sectors \u00d7 40 tracks \u00d7 2 sides</ref> The ''unformatted'' capacity of the floppy disks was advertised as \"250KB\" for SSDD and \"500KB\" for DSDD (\"KB\" ambiguously referring to either 1000 or 1024 bytes; essentially the same for rounded-off values), however these \"raw\" 250/500&nbsp;kB were not the same thing as the usable formatted capacity; under DOS, the maximum capacity for SSDD and DSDD disks was 180&nbsp;kB and 360&nbsp;kB, respectively. Regardless of type, the [[file system]] of all floppy disks (under DOS) was [[FAT12]].\n\nAfter the upgraded 64k-256k motherboard PCs arrived in early 1983, single-sided drives and the cassette model were discontinued.\n\nIBM's original floppy disk controller card also included an external 37-pin D-shell connector. This allowed users to connect additional external floppy drives by third party vendors, but IBM did not offer their own external floppies until 1986.\n\nThe industry-standard way of setting floppy drive numbers was via setting jumper switches on the drive unit, however IBM chose to instead use a method known as the \"cable twist\" which had a floppy data cable with a bend in the middle of it that served as a switch for the drive motor control. This eliminated the need for users to adjust jumpers while installing a floppy drive.\n\n====Fixed disks====\n[[File:ST 225 20MB drive and WDC controller.jpg|thumb|20MB [[Seagate Technology|Seagate]] ST-225 with a controller card by [[Western Digital]]]]\n\nThe 5150 could not itself power hard drives without retrofitting a stronger power supply, but IBM later offered the 5161 Expansion Unit, which not only provided more expansion slots, but also included a 10&nbsp;MB (later 20&nbsp;MB) hard drive powered by the 5161's own separate 130-watt power supply. The IBM 5161 Expansion Unit was released in early 1983.\n\nDuring the first year of the IBM PC, it was commonplace for users to install third-party Winchester hard disks which generally connected to the floppy controller and required a patched version of PC DOS which treated them as a giant floppy disk (there was no subdirectory support).\n\nIBM began offering hard disks with the XT, however the original PC was never sold with them. Nonetheless, many users installed hard disks and upgraded power supplies in them.\n\nAfter floppy disks became obsolete in the early 2000s, the letters A and B became unused. But for 25 years, virtually all DOS-based PC software assumed the program installation drive was C, so the primary HDD continues to be \"the C drive\" even today.\nOther operating system families (e.g. Unix) are not bound to these designations.\n\n====OS support====\n[[File:IBM DOS 1.1 Manual and Disk.jpg|right|upright|thumb|IBM Disk Operating System version 1.1 by Microsoft]]\n\nWhich operating system IBM customers would choose was at first unclear.<ref name=\"freibergeros19811005\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JT0EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA3&ots=UIUJBsfNdl&pg=RA1-PA50#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=Some Confusion at the Heart of IBM Microcomputer / Which Operating System Will Prevail? | work=InfoWorld | date=1981-10-05 | accessdate=1 January 2015 | author=Freiberger, Paul | pages=50\u201351}}</ref>{{r|morgan198201}} Although the company expected that most would use [[PC DOS]]{{r|bunnell19820405}} IBM supported using [[CP/M-86]]\u2014which became available six months after DOS<ref name=\"edlin19820607\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w_OhaFDePS4C&lpg=RA2-PA18&pg=RA2-PA43#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=CP/M Arrives | work=PC Magazine | date=June\u2013July 1982 | accessdate=21 October 2013 | author=Edlin, Jim | page=43}}</ref>\u2014or [[UCSD Pascal|UCSD p-System]] as operating systems.{{r|lemmons198110}} IBM promised that it would not favor one operating system over the others; the CP/M-86 support surprised Gates, who claimed that IBM was \"blackmailed into it\".{{r|freibergeros19811005}} IBM was correct, nonetheless, in its expectation; one survey found that 96.3% of PCs were ordered with the $40 DOS compared to 3.4% for the $240 CP/M-86.<ref name=\"pcommuniques198302\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7wCiNAUEuAMC&lpg=PA360&pg=PA53#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=PCommuniques | work=PC Magazine | date=February 1983 | accessdate=21 October 2013 | page=53}}</ref>\n\nThe IBM PC's ROM BASIC and BIOS supported cassette tape storage. PC DOS itself did not support cassette tape storage. PC DOS version 1.00 supported only 160&nbsp;kB SSDD floppies, but version 1.1, which was released nine months after the PC's introduction, supported 160&nbsp;kB SSDD and 320&nbsp;kB DSDD floppies. Support for the slightly larger nine sector per track 180&nbsp;kB and 360&nbsp;kB formats arrived 10 months later in March 1983.\n\n===BIOS===\nThe [[BIOS]] (Basic Input/Output System) provided the core ROM code for the PC. It contained a library of functions that software could call for basic tasks such as video output, keyboard input, and disk access in addition to interrupt handling, loading the operating system on boot-up, and testing memory and other system components.\n\nThe original IBM PC BIOS was 8k in size and occupied four 2k ROM chips on the motherboard, with a fifth and sixth empty slot left for any extra ROMs the user wished to install. IBM offered three different BIOS revisions during the PC's lifespan. The initial BIOS was dated April 1981 and came on the earliest models with single-sided floppy drives and PC DOS 1.00. The second version was dated October 1981 and arrived on the \"Revision B\" models sold with double-sided drives and PC DOS 1.10. It corrected some bugs, but was otherwise unchanged. Finally, the third BIOS version was dated October 1982 and found on all IBM PCs with the newer 64k-256k motherboard. This revision was more-or-less identical to the XT's BIOS. It added support for detecting ROMs on expansion cards as well as the ability to use 640k of memory (the earlier BIOS revisions had a limit of 544k). Unlike the XT, the original PC remained functionally unchanged from 1983 until its discontinuation in early 1987 and did not get support for 101-key keyboards or 3.5\" floppy drives, nor was it ever offered with half-height floppies.\n\n===Video output===\nIBM initially offered two video adapters for the PC, the [[Color Graphics Adapter|Color/Graphics Adapter]] and the [[Monochrome Display and Printer Adapter]]. CGA was intended to be a typical home computer display; it had NTSC output and could be connected to a composite monitor or a TV set with an RF modulator in addition to RGB for digital RGBI-type monitors, although IBM did not offer their own RGB monitor until 1983. Supported graphics modes were 40 or 80\u00d725 color text with 8\u00d78 character resolution, 320\u00d7200 bitmap graphics with two fixed 4-color palettes, or 640\u00d7200 monochrome graphics.\n\nThe MDA card and its companion 5151 monitor supported only 80\u00d725 text with a 9\u00d714 character resolution (total pixel resolution was 720\u00d7350). It was mainly intended for the business market and so also included a printer port.\n\nDuring 1982, the first third-party video card for the PC appeared when Hercules Computer Technologies released a clone of the MDA that could use bitmap graphics. Although not supported by the BIOS, the [[Hercules Graphics Card|Hercules Graphics Adapter]] became extremely popular for business use due to allowing sharp, high resolution graphics plus text and itself was widely cloned by other manufacturers.\n\nIn 1985, after the launch of the IBM AT, the new [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter]] became available which could support 320\u00d7200 or 640\u00d7200 in 16 colors in addition to high-resolution 640\u00d7350 16 color graphics.\n\nIBM also offered a video board for the PC, XT, and AT known as the [[Professional Graphics Adapter]] during 1984\u201386, mainly intended for CAD design. It was extremely expensive, required a special monitor, and was rarely ordered by customers.\n\n[[VGA]] graphics cards could also be installed in IBM PCs and XTs, although they were introduced after the computer's discontinuation.\n\n===Serial port addresses and interrupts===\nThe [[serial port]] is an [[8250 UART|8250]] or a derivative (such as the 16450 or [[16550 UART|16550]]), mapped to eight consecutive IO addresses and one interrupt request line.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! COM port\n! IRQ\n! Base port address &#91;[[Hexadecimal|Hex]]&#93;\n|-\n| COM1\n| IRQ4\n| 3F8\n|-\n| COM2\n| IRQ3\n| 2F8\n|-\n| COM3\n| IRQ4\n| 3E8\n|-\n| COM4\n| IRQ3\n| 2E8\n|}\n\nOnly COM1: and COM2: addresses were defined by the original PC. Attempts to share IRQ3 and IRQ4 to use additional ports require special measures in hardware and software, since shared IRQs were not defined in the original PC design. The most typical devices plugged into the serial port were [[modem]]s and [[mouse (computing)|mice]]. [[Plotter]]s and serial printers were also among the more commonly used serial peripherals, and there were numerous other more unusual uses such as operating [[cash register]]s, factory equipment, and connecting [[Computer terminal|terminal]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/pc-hardware-in/0596003536/ch01s03.html|title=System Resources - PC Hardware in a Nutshell, Second Edition [Book]|website=www.oreilly.com|language=en|access-date=2019-05-03}}</ref>\n\n===Printer port===\nIBM made a deal with Japan-based [[Epson]] to produce printers for the PC and all IBM-branded printers were manufactured by that company (Epson of course also sold printers with their own name). There was a considerable amount of controversy when IBM included a printer port on the PC that did not follow the industry-standard [[Centronics]] design, and it was rumored that this had been done to prevent customers from using non-Epson/IBM printers with their machines (plugging a Centronics printer into an IBM PC could damage the printer, the parallel port, or both). Although third-party cards were available with Centronics ports on them, PC clones quickly copied the IBM printer port and by the late 80s, it had largely displaced the Centronics standard.\n\n==Reception==\n''BYTE'' wrote in October 1981 that the IBM PC's \"hardware is impressive, but even more striking are two decisions made by IBM: to use outside suppliers already established in the microcomputer industry, and to provide information and assistance to independent, small-scale software writers and manufacturers of peripheral devices\". It praised the \"smart\" hardware design and stated that its price was not much higher than the 8-bit machines from Apple and others. The reviewer admitted that the computer \"came as a shock. I expected that the giant would stumble by overestimating or underestimating the capabilities the public wants and stubbornly insisting on incompatibility with the rest of the microcomputer world. But IBM didn't stumble at all; instead, the giant jumped leagues in front of the competition\". He concluded that \"the only disappointment about the IBM Personal Computer is its dull name\".<ref name=\"lemmons198110\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1981-10/1981_10_BYTE_06-10_Local_Networks#page/n27/mode/2up | title=The IBM Personal Computer / First Impressions | work=BYTE | date=October 1981 | accessdate=19 October 2013 | author=Lemmons, Phil | page=36}}</ref>\n\nIn a more detailed review in January 1982, ''BYTE'' called the IBM PC \"a synthesis of the best the microcomputer industry has offered to date ... as well designed on the inside as it is on the outside\". The magazine praised the keyboard as \"bar none, the best ... on any microcomputer\", describing the unusual Shift key locations as \"minor [problems] compared to some of the gigantic mistakes made on almost every other microcomputer keyboard\". The review also complimented IBM's manuals, which it predicted \"will set the standard for all microcomputer documentation in the future. Not only are they well packaged, well organized, and easy to understand, but they are also ''complete''\". Observing that detailed technical information was available \"much earlier ... than it has been for other machines\", the magazine predicted that \"given a reasonable period of time, plenty of hardware and software will probably be developed for\" the computer. The review stated that although the IBM PC cost more than comparably configured Apple II and TRS-80 computers, and the insufficient number of slots for all desirable expansion cards was its most serious weakness, \"you get a ''lot'' more for your money\". He concluded, \"In two years or so, I think [it] will be one of the most popular and best-supported ... IBM should be proud of the people who designed it\".<ref name=\"williams198201\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1982-01/1982_01_BYTE_07-01_The_IBM_Personal_Computer#page/n37/mode/2up | title=A Closer Look at the IBM Personal Computer | work=BYTE | date=January 1982 | accessdate=19 October 2013 | author=Williams, Gregg | page=36}}</ref>\n\nIn a special 1984 issue dedicated to the IBM PC, ''BYTE'' concluded that the PC had succeeded both because of its features like an 80-column screen, open architecture, and high-quality keyboard, and \"the failure of other major companies to provide these same fundamental features earlier.

In June 2006, IBM PC and XT models were still in use at the majority of U.S. [[National Weather Service]] upper-air observing sites, used to process data as it is returned from the ascending [[radiosonde]], attached to a [[weather balloon]], although they have been slowly phased out. Factors that have contributed to the 5150 PC's longevity are its flexible modular design, its open technical standard (making information needed to adapt, modify, and repair it readily available), use of few special nonstandard parts, and rugged high-standard IBM manufacturing, which provided for exceptional long-term reliability and durability.\n\nSome of the mechanical aspects of the slot specifications are still used in current PCs. A few systems still come with PS/2 style keyboard and mouse connectors.\n\n==Collectability==\nThe IBM model 5150 Personal Computer has become a collectable among vintage computer collectors, due to the system being the first true \u201cPC\u201d as we know them today. {{As of|2007}}, the system had a market value of $50\u2013$500.<ref name=\"McCracken2007\">{{cite web|last1=McCracken|first1=Harry|title=The Most Collectible PCs of All Time|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/136242/article.html|website=PCWorld|accessdate=25 September 2017|language=en|date=27 August 2007}}</ref>  The IBM model 5150 has proven to be reliable; despite their age of 30 years or more, some still function as they did when new.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/237878/can_you_do_real_work_with_the_30yearold_ibm_5150.html|title=Can You Do Real Work With the 30-Year-Old IBM 5150?|publisher=|date=2011-08-11}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[386SLC]]\n*[[Macintosh|Apple Macintosh]]\n*[[Amiga|Commodore Amiga]]\n*[[Atari ST]]\n*[[Conventional memory]]\n*[[IBM 5120]]\n*[[IBM Aptiva]]\n*[[IBM PCjr]]\n*[[IBM Portable Personal Computer]]\n*[[Token ring|IBM token ring]] networks\n*[[Input/Output Base Address]]\n*[[List of IBM products]]\n*[[ThinkCentre]]\n*[[ThinkPad]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n;Cited references\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n;General references\n{{Refbegin}}\n*Norton, Peter (1986).

It is [[IBM]] model number '''5150''' and was introduced on August 12, 1981. It was created by a team of engineers and designers under the direction of [[Don Estridge]] in [[Boca Raton, Florida]].\n\nThe generic term \"personal computer\" (\"PC\") was in use years before 1981, applied as early as 1972 to the [[PARC (company)|Xerox PARC]]'s [[Xerox Alto|Alto]], but the term \"PC\" came to mean more specifically a desktop microcomputer compatible with IBM's ''Personal Computer'' branded products. The machine was based on [[open architecture]], and third-party suppliers sprang up to provide peripheral devices, expansion cards, and software. [[influence of the IBM PC on the personal computer market|IBM had a substantial influence]] on the personal computer market in standardizing a platform for personal computers, and \"IBM compatible\" became an important criterion for sales growth.

The 801 processor was more than an order of magnitude more powerful than the [[Intel 8088]], and the operating system more advanced than the [[PC DOS 1.0]] operating system from [[Microsoft]]. Ruling out an in-house solution made the team's job much easier and may have avoided a delay in the schedule, but the ultimate consequences of this decision for IBM were far-reaching.\n\nIBM had recently developed the [[IBM System/23 Datamaster]] business microcomputer, which uses a processor and other chips from Intel; familiarity with them and the immediate availability of the 8088 was a reason for choosing it for the PC. The 62-pin expansion bus slots were designed to be similar to the Datamaster slots. Differences from the Datamaster include avoiding an [[all-in-one PC|all-in-one design]] while limiting the computer's size so that it fits on a standard desktop with the keyboard (also similar to the Datamaster's), and {{frac|5|1|4}}\" disk drives instead of 8\".

Some programs are time sensitive to a particular speed class. Older programs will not take advantage of newer higher-resolution and higher-color display standards, while some newer programs require newer display adapters.<!-- An example is Majhongg by Nels Anderson, which supports no less than EGA graphics -->  (Note that as the display adapter was an adapter card in all of these IBM models, newer display hardware could easily be, and often was, retrofitted to older models.)  A few programs, typically very early ones, are written for and require a specific version of the IBM PC BIOS ROM.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}  Most notably, [[BASICA]] which was dependent on the BIOS ROM had a sister program called [[GW-BASIC]] which supported more functions, was 100% backwards compatible and could run independently from the BIOS ROM.\n\n===Original PC===\n[[File:IMB PC-IMG 7271.jpg|thumb|IBM PC 5150]]\nThe [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]] video card, with a suitable modulator, could use an NTSC [[television]] set or an RGBi monitor for display; IBM's RGBi monitor was their display model 5153. The other option that was offered by IBM was an [[Monochrome Display Adapter|MDA]] and their [[IBM 5151|monochrome display model 5151]]. It was possible to install both an MDA and a CGA card and use both monitors concurrently<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seasip.info/VintagePC/dualhead.html|title=Dual-Head operation on vintage PCs|publisher=}}</ref> if supported by the application program. For example, [[AutoCAD]], [[Lotus 1-2-3]] and others allowed use of a CGA Monitor for graphics and a separate [[monochrome monitor]] for text menus. Some model 5150 PCs with CGA monitors and a printer port also included the MDA adapter by default, because IBM provided the MDA port and printer port on the same adapter card; it was in fact an MDA/printer port combo card.\n\nAlthough [[Compact Cassette|cassette tape]] was originally envisioned by IBM as a low-budget storage alternative, the most commonly used medium was the [[floppy disk]]. The 5150 was available with one or two {{frac|5|1|4}}\" floppy drives \u2013 with two drives the program disc(s) would be in drive A, while drive B would hold the disc(s) for working files; with one drive the user had to swap program and file discs into the single drive. For models without any drives or storage medium, IBM intended users to connect their own cassette recorder via the 5150's cassette socket. The cassette tape socket was physically the same [[DIN connector|DIN plug]] as the keyboard socket and next to it, but electrically completely different.\n\nA [[hard disk drive]] could not be installed into the 5150's system unit without changing to a higher-rated power supply (although later drives with lower power consumption have been known to work with the standard 63.5 Watt unit). The \"IBM 5161 Expansion Chassis\" came with its own power supply and one 10&nbsp;MB hard disk and allowed the installation of a second hard disk.<ref>Scott Mueller ''Upgrading and Repairing PCs, Second Edition'', Que Books, 1992, {{ISBN|0-88022-856-3}} page 48</ref> Without the expansion chassis perhaps one free slot remains after installing necessary cards,<ref name=\"freeze19851216\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cC8EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA43&pg=PA43#v=onepage&f=true | title=Leading Edge: Superior Value In IBM-PC Clone Market Contest | work=InfoWorld | date=1985-12-16 | accessdate=22 July 2014 | author=Freeze, Ken | pages=43}}</ref> as a working configuration requires that some of the slots be occupied by display, disk, and I/O adapters, as none of these were built into the 5150's motherboard; the only motherboard external connectors are the keyboard and cassette ports.The system unit has five expansion slots, and the expansion unit has eight; however, one of the system unit's slots and one of the expansion unit's slots have to be occupied by the Extender Card and Receiver Card, respectively, which are needed to connect the expansion unit to the system unit and make the expansion unit's other slots available, for a total of 11 slots.\n\nThe simple [[PC speaker]] sound hardware was also on board.\n\nThe original PC's maximum memory using IBM parts was 256&nbsp;[[Kilobyte|kB]], achievable through the installation of 64&nbsp;kB on the motherboard and three 64 kB expansion cards. The processor was an [[Intel 8088]] running at 4.77&nbsp;[[megahertz|MHz]], 4/3 the standard NTSC [[color burst]] frequency of 315/88&nbsp;=&nbsp;3.579{{Overline|54}}{{Efn|[[Repeating decimal#Notation|Repeating decimal notation]]}}&nbsp;MHz. (In early units, the Intel 8088 used was a 1978 version, later were 1978/81/2 versions of the Intel chip; second-sourced [[AMD]]s were used after 1983){{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}. Some owners replaced the 8088 with an [[NEC V20]] for a slight increase in processing speed and support for real mode 80186 instructions. The V20 gained its speed increase through the use of a hardware multiplier which the 8088 lacked. An [[Intel 8087]] [[coprocessor]] could also be added for hardware floating-point arithmetic.\n\nIBM sold the first IBM PCs in configurations with 16 or 64&nbsp;kB of [[random-access memory|RAM]] preinstalled using either nine or thirty-six 16-[[kilobit]] [[DRAM]] chips. (The ninth bit was used for [[parity bit|parity]] checking of memory.) In November 1982, the hardware was changed to allow the use of 64-Kbit chips (as opposed to the original 16-Kbit chips) - the same RAM configuration as the soon-to-be-released IBM XT. (64 kB in one bank, expandable to 256kB by populating the other three banks.)\n\nAlthough the TV-compatible video board, cassette port and [[Federal Communications Commission]] Class B certification were all aimed at making it a [[home computer]],{{r|bradley199009}} the original PC proved too expensive for the home market. At introduction, a PC with 64 kB of RAM and a single 5.25-inch floppy drive and monitor sold for {{nowrap|[[United States dollar|US $]]3,005}} ({{Inflation|US|3005|1981|fmt=eq}}), while the cheapest configuration ({{nowrap|US $1,565}}) that had no floppy drives, only 16&nbsp;kB RAM, and no monitor (again, under the expectation that users would connect their existing TV sets and cassette recorders) proved too unattractive and low-spec, even for its time (cf. footnotes to the above IBM PC range table).<ref>[http://www.tmworld.com/article/CA187350.html Whence Came the IBM PC Test and Measurement World] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217120019/http://www.tmworld.com/article/CA187350.html |date=2007-12-17 }}, retrieved March 2,</ref><ref>Gene Smart and Andrew Reinhardt, ''15 years of Bits, Bytes and Other Great Moments'', ''[[BYTE Magazine]]'', September 1990 pg. 382</ref> While the 5150 did not become a top selling home computer, its floppy-based configuration became an unexpectedly large success with businesses.\n\n===XT===\n{{Main|IBM Personal Computer XT}}\n\nThe \"IBM Personal Computer XT\", IBM model 5160, was introduced two years after the PC and featured a 10 megabyte hard drive. It had eight expansion slots but the same processor and clock speed as the PC. The XT had no cassette jack, but still had the Cassette Basic interpreter in ROMs.\n\nThe XT could take 256&nbsp;kB of memory on the main board (using 64&nbsp;kbit DRAM); later models were expandable to 640&nbsp;kB. The remaining 384 kilobytes of the 8088 address space (between 640 KB and 1 MB) were used for the BIOS ROM, adapter ROM and RAM space, including video RAM space. It was usually sold with a [[Monochrome Display Adapter]] (MDA) video card or a CGA video card.\n\nThe eight expansion slots were the same as the model 5150 but were spaced closer together. Although rare, a card designed for the 5150 could be wide enough to obstruct the adjacent slot in an XT.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.howard81.co.uk/upload/vcf/xt/newxt/xt_mainboard2.JPG|title=Howard81.co.uk|publisher=|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627010207/http://www.howard81.co.uk/upload/vcf/xt/newxt/xt_mainboard2.JPG|archive-date=2008-06-27|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.howard81.co.uk/upload/vcf/5150/5150_mainboard(highres).JPG|title=Howard81.co.uk|publisher=}}</ref>  Because of the spacing, an XT motherboard would not fit into a case designed for the PC motherboard, but the slots and peripheral cards were compatible. The XT expansion bus (later called \"8-bit [[Industry Standard Architecture]]\" (ISA) by competitors) was retained in the IBM AT, which added connectors for some slots to allow 16-bit transfers; 8-bit cards could be used in an AT.\n\n===XT/370===\n{{main|PC-based IBM-compatible mainframes}}\nThe \"IBM Personal Computer XT/370\" was an XT with three custom 8-bit cards: the processor card (370PC-P) contained a modified [[Motorola 68000]] chip, microcoded to execute [[System/370]] instructions, a second 68000 to handle bus arbitration and memory transfers, and a modified 8087 to emulate the S/370 [[floating point]] instructions. The second card (370PC-M) connected to the first and contained 512 kB of memory. The third card (PC3277-EM), was a 3270 terminal emulator necessary to install the system software for the VM/PC software to run the processors.\n\nThe computer booted into DOS, then ran the VM/PC Control Program.<ref>[http://www.corestore.org/XT370-1.jpg Corestore.org]</ref><ref>Muller, Guide to repairing and upgrading PCs 6th edition</ref>\n\n===PCjr===\n{{Main|IBM PCjr}}\nThe \"IBM PCjr\" was IBM's first attempt to enter the market for relatively inexpensive educational and home-use personal computers. The PCjr, IBM model number 4860, retained the IBM PC's 8088 CPU and BIOS interface for compatibility, but its cost and differences in the PCjr's architecture, as well as other design and implementation decisions (chief among these was the use of a \"chiclet\" keyboard, which was difficult to type with), eventually led to the PCjr, and the related [[IBM JX]], being commercial failures.\n\n===Portable===\n{{Main|IBM Portable Personal Computer}}\nThe \"IBM Portable Personal Computer\" 5155 model 68 was an early portable computer developed by IBM after the success of Compaq's suitcase-size portable machine (the Compaq Portable). It was released in February 1984, and was eventually replaced by the IBM Convertible.\n\nThe Portable was an XT motherboard, transplanted into a Compaq-style luggable case. The system featured 256 kilobytes of memory (expandable to 512&nbsp;KB), an added CGA card connected to an internal monochrome (amber) composite monitor, and one or two half-height 5.25\" 360&nbsp;KB floppy disk drives. Unlike the Compaq Portable, which used a dual-mode monitor and special display card, IBM used a stock CGA board and a composite monitor, which had lower resolution. It could however, display color if connected to an external monitor or television.\n\n===AT===\n{{Main|IBM Personal Computer/AT}}\n\nThe \"IBM Personal Computer/AT\" (model 5170), announced August 15, 1984, used an [[Intel 80286]] processor, originally running at 6&nbsp;MHz. It had a 16-[[bit]] ISA bus and 20&nbsp;MB [[hard drive]]. A faster model, running at 8&nbsp;MHz and sporting a 30-megabyte hard disk<ref>i.e. 33% more speed, 50% more disk space</ref> was introduced in 1986.<ref>PC Magazine, Sept. 30, 1986, pp. 179-184</ref>\n\nThe AT was designed to support multitasking; the new SysRq ([[system request]]) key, little noted and often overlooked, is part of this design, as is the 80286 itself, the first Intel 16-bit processor with multitasking features (i.e. the 80286 protected mode). IBM made some attempt at marketing the AT as a multi-user machine, but it sold mainly as a faster PC for power users. For the most part, IBM PC/ATs were used as more powerful DOS (single-tasking) personal computers, in the literal sense of the PC name.\n\nEarly PC/ATs were plagued with reliability problems, in part because of some software and hardware incompatibilities, but mostly related to the internal 20&nbsp;MB hard disk, and High Density Floppy Disk Drive.<ref>The opening sentence of an April 29, 1986 PC Magazine article reads \"If you own an IBM PC AT and your hard disk hasn't crashed yet, don't worry &ndash; it probably will.\" [https://web.archive.org/web/20121104075857/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-3760999.html highbeam.com] & [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P2-3760999.html encyclopedia.com] (the latter a Chicago Sun-Times article citing the PC Magazine story). IBM recovered, although with mixed comments, as noted in the Sept. 30, 1986 PC Magazine article, \"The Two Faces of IBM's 8-MHz AT,\" pp. 179 - 184.</ref>\n\nWhile some people blamed IBM's [[hard disk controller]] card and others blamed the hard disk manufacturer [[Computer Memories Inc.]] (CMI), the IBM controller card worked fine with other drives, including CMI's 33-MB model. The problems introduced doubt about the computer and, for a while, even about the 286 architecture in general, but after IBM replaced the 20&nbsp;MB CMI drives, the PC/AT proved reliable and became a lasting industry standard.\n\nIBM AT's Drive parameter table listed the CMI-33 as having 615 cylinders instead of the 640 the drive was designed with, as to make the size an even 30 MB. Those who re-used the drives mostly found that the 616th cylinder was bad due to it being used as a landing area.\n\n===AT/370===\nThe \"IBM Personal Computer AT/370\" was an AT with two custom 16-bit cards, running almost exactly the same setup as the XT/370.\n\n===Convertible===\n{{Main|IBM PC Convertible}}\nThe IBM PC Convertible, released April 3, 1986, was IBM's first laptop computer and was also the first IBM computer to utilize the 3.5\" floppy disk which went on to become the standard. Like modern laptops, it featured power management and the ability to run from batteries. It was the follow-up to the IBM Portable and was model number 5140. The concept and the design of the body was made by the German industrial designer [[Richard Sapper]].\n\nIt utilized an Intel 80c88 CPU (a CMOS version of the Intel 8088) running at 4.77&nbsp;MHz, 256 kB of RAM (expandable to 640 kB), dual 720 kB 3.5\" floppy drives, and a monochrome CGA-compatible LCD screen at a price of $2,000. It weighed {{convert|13|lb|kg}} and featured a built-in carrying handle.\n\nThe PC Convertible had expansion capabilities through a proprietary ISA bus-based port on the rear of the machine. Extension modules, including a small printer and a video output module, could be snapped into place. The machine could also take an internal modem, but there was no room for an internal hard disk.\n\n===Next-generation IBM PS/2===\nThe [[IBM PS/2]] line was introduced in 1987. The Model 30 at the bottom end of the lineup was very similar to earlier models; it used an 8086 processor and an ISA bus. The Model 30 was not \"IBM compatible\" in that it did not have standard 5.25-inch drive bays; it came with a 3.5-inch floppy drive and optionally a 3.5-inch-sized hard disk. Most models in the PS/2 line further departed from \"IBM compatible\" by replacing the ISA bus completely with [[Micro Channel architecture|Micro Channel Architecture]]. The MCA bus was not received well by the customer base for PC's, since it was proprietary to IBM. It was rarely implemented by any of the other PC-compatible makers. Eventually IBM would abandon this architecture entirely and return to the standard ISA bus.\n\n==Technology==\n\n===Electronics===\n[[File:IBM PC Motherboard (1981).jpg|thumb|Original IBM Personal Computer motherboard, IBM 5150. It has five expansion slots (an interface later called \"PC/XT-bus\" by IBM and \"8-bit [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]]\" by other manufacturers of compatible computers), and two DIN connectors for keyboard and cassette interface.]]\nThe main circuit board in a PC is called the [[motherboard]] (IBM terminology calls it a ''planar''). This mainly carries the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] and [[computer memory|RAM]], and has a [[computer bus|bus]] with slots for expansion cards. Also on the motherboard are the ROM subsystem, DMA and IRQ controllers, coprocessor socket, sound (PC speaker, tone generation) circuitry, and keyboard interface. The original PC also has a cassette interface.\n\nThe bus used in the original PC became very popular, and it was later named [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]]. It was originally known as the PC-bus or XT-bus; the term ''ISA'' arose later when industry leaders chose to continue manufacturing machines based on the IBM PC AT architecture rather than license the [[IBM Personal System/2|PS/2]] architecture and its [[Micro Channel architecture|Micro Channel]] bus from IBM. The XT-bus was then retroactively named ''8-bit ISA'' or ''XT ISA'', while the unqualified term ''ISA'' usually refers to the 16-bit AT-bus (as better defined in the ISA specifications). The AT-bus is an extension of the PC-/XT-bus and is in use to this day in computers for industrial use, where its relatively low speed, 5-volt signals, and relatively simple, straightforward design (all by year 2011 standards) give it technical advantages (e.g. noise immunity for reliability).\n\n[[File:KL Quadram Quadboard.jpg|right|thumb|Quadram Quadboard]]\nA monitor and any floppy or hard disk drives are connected to the motherboard through cables connected to graphics adapter and disk controller cards, respectively, installed in expansion slots. Each expansion slot on the motherboard has a corresponding opening in the back of the computer case through which the card can expose connectors; a blank metal cover plate covers this case opening (to prevent dust and debris intrusion and control airflow) when no expansion card is installed. Memory expansion beyond the amount installable on the motherboard was also done with boards installed in expansion slots, and I/O devices such as parallel, serial, or network ports were likewise installed as individual expansion boards. For this reason, it was easy to fill the five expansion slots of the PC, or even the eight slots of the XT, even without installing any special hardware. Companies like Quadram and AST addressed this with their popular multi-I/O cards which combine several peripherals on one adapter card that uses only one slot; Quadram offered the QuadBoard and AST the SixPak.\n\n[[Intel]] 8086 and [[Intel 8088|8088]]-based PCs require [[expanded memory]] (EMS) boards to work with more than 640&nbsp;kB of memory. (Though the 8088 can address one [[megabyte]] of memory, the last 384&nbsp;kB of that is used or reserved for the BIOS ROM, BASIC ROM, extension ROMs installed on adapter cards, and memory address space used by devices including display adapter RAM and even the 64&nbsp;kB EMS page frame itself.) The original IBM PC AT used an [[Intel 80286]] processor which can access up to 16&nbsp;MB of memory (though standard [[DOS]] applications cannot use more than one megabyte without using additional APIs). Intel 80286-based computers running under [[OS/2]] can work with the maximum memory.\n\n===Peripheral integrated circuits===\nThe set of peripheral chips selected for the original IBM PC defined the functionality of an IBM compatible. These became the de facto base for later [[application-specific integrated circuit]]s (ASICs) used in compatible products.\n\nThe original system chips were one [[Intel 8259]] programmable interrupt controller (PIC) (at I/O address {{nowrap|0x20}}), one [[Intel 8237]] direct memory access (DMA) controller (at I/O address {{nowrap|0x00}}), and an [[Intel 8253]] programmable interval timer (PIT) (at I/O address {{nowrap|0x40}}). The PIT provides the {{nowrap|18.2 Hz}} clock ticks, dynamic memory refresh timing, and can be used for speaker output;<ref>[http://www.arl.wustl.edu/~lockwood/class/cs306/lecture/l16.html wustl.edu - ECE306 Lecture 16] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724180117/http://www.arl.wustl.edu/~lockwood/class/cs306/lecture/l16.html |date=2011-07-24 }}</ref> one DMA channel is used to perform the memory refresh.\n\nThe mathematics [[coprocessor]] was the Intel [[x87#8087|8087]] using I/O address 0xF0.

(However, it is not difficult to design and construct a level converter that will convert between IBM serial port and standard RS-232 signals.)</ref> [[RS-232]] port.\n\n===Joystick port===\nIBM offered a [[Game port|Game Control Adapter]] for the PC,{{r|lemmons198110}} which supported analog joysticks similar to those on the Apple II. Although analog controls proved inferior for arcade-style games, they were an asset in certain other genres such as [[flight simulator]]s. The joystick port on the IBM PC supported two controllers, but required a Y-splitter cable to connect both at once. It remained the standard joystick interface on IBM compatibles until being replaced by [[USB]] during the 2000s.\n\n===Keyboard===\n{{main|IBM PC keyboard}}\n[[File:IBM_Model_F_XT.png|thumb|The original keyboard for the IBM 5150 and XT]]\n\nThe keyboard that came with the IBM 5150 was an extremely reliable and high-quality electronic keyboard originally developed in North Carolina for the Datamaster.{{r|bradley199009}} Each key was rated to be reliable to over 100 million keystrokes. For the IBM PC, a separate keyboard housing was designed with a novel usability feature that allowed users to adjust the keyboard angle for personal comfort. Compared with the keyboards of other small computers at the time, the [[IBM PC keyboard]] was far superior and played a significant role in establishing a high-quality impression. For example, the industrial design of the adjustable keyboard, together with the system unit, was recognized with a major design award.<ref name=ID/> ''[[Byte (magazine)|Byte]]'' magazine in the fall of 1981 went so far as to state that the keyboard was 50% of the reason to buy an IBM PC. The importance of the keyboard was definitely established when the 1983 [[IBM PCjr]] flopped, in very large part for having a much different and mediocre [[Chiclet keyboard]] that made a poor impression on customers. Oddly enough, the same thing almost happened to the original IBM PC when in early 1981 management seriously considered substituting a cheaper and lower quality keyboard. This mistake was narrowly avoided on the advice of one of the original development engineers.\n\nHowever, the original 1981 IBM PC 83-key [[computer keyboard|keyboard]] was criticized by typists for its non-standard placement of the {{Key press |[[Return key|Return]]}} and left {{Key press |[[Shift key|Shift]]}} keys, and because it did not have separate cursor and numeric pads that were popular on the pre-PC [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[VT100]] series video terminals. In 1982, [[Key Tronic]] introduced a 101-key PC keyboard, albeit not with the now-familiar layout. In 1984, IBM corrected the {{Key press |Return}} and left {{Key press |Shift}} keys on its AT keyboard, but shortened the {{Key press |[[Backspace key|Backspace]]}} key, making it harder to reach. In 1986, IBM introduced the 101 key [[Enhanced Keyboard]], which added the separate cursor and numeric key pads, relocated all the function keys and the {{Key press |[[Ctrl key|Ctrl]]}} keys, and the {{Key press |[[Esc key|Esc]]}} key was also relocated to the opposite side of the keyboard. The Enhanced Keyboard was an option for the PC XT/AT in 1986, both of which were also available with their original keyboards, and introduced the key layout that's still the industry standard.\n\nAnother feature of the original keyboard is the relatively loud \"click\" sound each key made when pressed. Since typewriter users were accustomed to keeping their eyes on the hardcopy they were typing from and had come to rely on the mechanical sound that was made as each character was typed onto the paper to ensure that they had pressed the key hard enough (and only once), the PC keyboard used a keyswitch that produced a click and tactile bump intended to provide that same reassurance.\n\nThe IBM PC keyboard is very robust and flexible. The low-level interface for each key is the same: each key sends a signal when it is pressed and another signal when it is released. An integrated microcontroller in the keyboard scans the keyboard and encodes a \"scan code\" and \"release code\" for each key as it is pressed and released separately. Any key can be used as a shift key, and a large number of keys can be held down simultaneously and separately sensed. The controller in the keyboard handles typematic operation, issuing periodic repeat scan codes for a depressed key and then a single release code when the key is finally released.\n\nAn \"IBM PC compatible\" may have a keyboard that does not recognize every key combination a true IBM PC does, such as shifted cursor keys. In addition, the \"compatible\" vendors sometimes used proprietary keyboard interfaces, preventing the keyboard from being replaced.\n\nAlthough the PC/XT and AT used the same style of keyboard connector, the low-level protocol for reading the keyboard was different between these two series. The AT keyboard uses a bidirectional interface which allows the computer to send commands to the keyboard. An AT keyboard could not be used in an XT, nor the reverse. Third-party keyboard manufacturers provided a switch on some of their keyboards to select either the AT-style or XT-style protocol for the keyboard.\n\n{{See also|Keyboard layout}}\n\n===Character set===\nThe original IBM PC used the 7-bit [[ASCII]] alphabet as its basis, but extended it to 8 bits with nonstandard character codes. This character set was not suitable for some international applications, and soon a veritable cottage industry emerged providing variants of the original character set in various national variants. In IBM tradition, these variants were called [[code page]]s. These codings are now obsolete, having been replaced by more systematic and standardized forms of character coding, such as [[ISO 8859-1]], [[Windows-1251]] and [[Unicode]]. The original character set is known as [[code page 437]].\n\n===Storage media===\n\n====Cassette tape====\n{{Main|IBM cassette tape}}\n\nIBM equipped the model 5150 with a cassette port for connecting a [[Compact cassette#Data recording|cassette]] drive and assumed that home users would purchase the low-end model and save files to cassette tapes as was typical of home computers of the time. However, adoption of the floppy- and monitor-less configuration was low; few (if any) IBM PCs left the factory without a floppy disk drive installed. Also, DOS was not available on cassette tape, only on floppy disks (hence \"Disk Operating System\"). 5150s with just external cassette recorders for storage could only use the built-in ROM BASIC as their operating system. As DOS saw increasing adoption, the incompatibility of DOS programs with PCs that used only cassettes for storage made this configuration even less attractive. The ROM BIOS supported cassette operations.\n\n[[IBM Cassette tape|The IBM PC cassette interface]] encodes data using frequency modulation with a variable data rate. Either a one or a zero is represented by a single cycle of a square wave, but the square wave frequencies differ by a factor of two, with ones having the lower frequency. Therefore, the bit periods for zeros and ones also differ by a factor of two, with the unusual effect that a data stream with more zeros than ones will use less tape (and time) than an equal-length (in bits) data stream containing more ones than zeros, or equal numbers of each.\n\nIBM also had an exclusive license agreement with Microsoft to include BASIC in the ROM of the PC; clone manufacturers could not have ROM BASIC on their machines, but it also became a problem as the XT, AT, and PS/2 eliminated the cassette port and IBM was still required to install the (now useless) BASIC with them. The agreement finally expired in 1991 when Microsoft replaced BASICA/GW-BASIC with [[QBASIC]]. The main core BASIC resided in ROM and \"linked\" up with the RAM-resident BASIC.COM/BASICA.COM included with PC DOS (they provided disk support and other extended features not present in ROM BASIC). Because BASIC was over 50 kB in size, this served a useful function during the first three years of the PC when machines only had 64\u2013128 kB of memory, but became less important by 1985. For comparison, clone makers such as Compaq were forced to include a version of BASIC that resided entirely in RAM.\n\n====Floppy diskettes====\n[[File:IBM Floppy Drive With DOS.jpg|right|thumb|Tandon 5.25-inch [[Disk storage|Diskette Drive]] with a partially inserted double-density diskette containing DOS 1.1.]]\n\nThe first IBM 5150 PCs had two 5.25-inch 160&nbsp;KiB single sided double density (SSDD) [[floppy disk]] drives. As two heads drives became available in the spring of 1982, later IBM PC and compatible computers could read 320&nbsp;KiB double sided double density (DSDD) disks with software support of MS-DOS&nbsp;1.25 and higher. The same type of physical diskette media could be used for both drives but a disk formatted for double-sided use could not be read on a single-sided drive. PC DOS&nbsp;2.0 added support for 180&nbsp;KiB and 360&nbsp;KiB SSDD and DSDD floppy disks, using the same physical media again.\n\nThe disks were [[Modified Frequency Modulation]] (MFM) coded in 512-byte sectors, and were soft-sectored.<ref>{{cite book|last=IBM|title=Technical Reference: Personal Computer Hardware Reference Library|publisher=IBM Corp.|date=July 1982|edition=Revised|pages=2\u201393|id=6025008}}</ref> They contained 40 tracks per side at the 48 track per inch (TPI) density,<ref>Sometimes the tracks were also referred as cylinders, which is technically correct and analogous to hard drive cylinders. One floppy disk track equaled one cylinder, however with double-sided floppies, only the first side's cylinder numbers were identical to the track numbers; on the second side, the cylinders 1-40 corresponded to tracks 41-80 of the formatted floppy.<!-- Does anyone know whether SSDD drives could read files stored on the first 40 tracks of a DSDD formatted floppy?--></ref> and initially were formatted to contain eight sectors per track. This meant that SSDD disks initially had a formatted capacity of 160&nbsp;kB,<ref>163,840 bytes, i.e. 512 bytes \u00d7 8 sectors \u00d7 40 tracks on the one side used</ref> while DSDD disks had a capacity of 320&nbsp;kB.<ref>327,680 bytes, i.e. 512 bytes \u00d7 8 sectors \u00d7 40 tracks \u00d7 2 sides</ref> However, the PC DOS&nbsp;2.0 and later operating systems allowed formatting the disks with nine sectors per track. This yielded a formatted capacity of 180&nbsp;kB with SSDD disks/drives,<ref>184,320 bytes, i.e. 512 bytes \u00d7 9 sectors \u00d7 40 tracks on the one side used</ref> and 360 kB with DSDD disks/drives.<ref>368,640 bytes, i.e. 512 bytes \u00d7 9 sectors \u00d7 40 tracks \u00d7 2 sides</ref> The ''unformatted'' capacity of the floppy disks was advertised as \"250KB\" for SSDD and \"500KB\" for DSDD (\"KB\" ambiguously referring to either 1000 or 1024 bytes; essentially the same for rounded-off values), however these \"raw\" 250/500&nbsp;kB were not the same thing as the usable formatted capacity; under DOS, the maximum capacity for SSDD and DSDD disks was 180&nbsp;kB and 360&nbsp;kB, respectively. Regardless of type, the [[file system]] of all floppy disks (under DOS) was [[FAT12]].\n\nAfter the upgraded 64k-256k motherboard PCs arrived in early 1983, single-sided drives and the cassette model were discontinued.\n\nIBM's original floppy disk controller card also included an external 37-pin D-shell connector. This allowed users to connect additional external floppy drives by third party vendors, but IBM did not offer their own external floppies until 1986.\n\nThe industry-standard way of setting floppy drive numbers was via setting jumper switches on the drive unit, however IBM chose to instead use a method known as the \"cable twist\" which had a floppy data cable with a bend in the middle of it that served as a switch for the drive motor control. This eliminated the need for users to adjust jumpers while installing a floppy drive.\n\n====Fixed disks====\n[[File:ST 225 20MB drive and WDC controller.jpg|thumb|20MB [[Seagate Technology|Seagate]] ST-225 with a controller card by [[Western Digital]]]]\n\nThe 5150 could not itself power hard drives without retrofitting a stronger power supply, but IBM later offered the 5161 Expansion Unit, which not only provided more expansion slots, but also included a 10&nbsp;MB (later 20&nbsp;MB) hard drive powered by the 5161's own separate 130-watt power supply. The IBM 5161 Expansion Unit was released in early 1983.\n\nDuring the first year of the IBM PC, it was commonplace for users to install third-party Winchester hard disks which generally connected to the floppy controller and required a patched version of PC DOS which treated them as a giant floppy disk (there was no subdirectory support).\n\nIBM began offering hard disks with the XT, however the original PC was never sold with them. Nonetheless, many users installed hard disks and upgraded power supplies in them.\n\nAfter floppy disks became obsolete in the early 2000s, the letters A and B became unused. But for 25 years, virtually all DOS-based PC software assumed the program installation drive was C, so the primary HDD continues to be \"the C drive\" even today.\nOther operating system families (e.g. Unix) are not bound to these designations.\n\n====OS support====\n[[File:IBM DOS 1.1 Manual and Disk.jpg|right|upright|thumb|IBM Disk Operating System version 1.1 by Microsoft]]\n\nWhich operating system IBM customers would choose was at first unclear.<ref name=\"freibergeros19811005\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JT0EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA3&ots=UIUJBsfNdl&pg=RA1-PA50#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=Some Confusion at the Heart of IBM Microcomputer / Which Operating System Will Prevail? | work=InfoWorld | date=1981-10-05 | accessdate=1 January 2015 | author=Freiberger, Paul | pages=50\u201351}}</ref>{{r|morgan198201}} Although the company expected that most would use [[PC DOS]]{{r|bunnell19820405}} IBM supported using [[CP/M-86]]\u2014which became available six months after DOS<ref name=\"edlin19820607\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w_OhaFDePS4C&lpg=RA2-PA18&pg=RA2-PA43#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=CP/M Arrives | work=PC Magazine | date=June\u2013July 1982 | accessdate=21 October 2013 | author=Edlin, Jim | page=43}}</ref>\u2014or [[UCSD Pascal|UCSD p-System]] as operating systems.{{r|lemmons198110}} IBM promised that it would not favor one operating system over the others; the CP/M-86 support surprised Gates, who claimed that IBM was \"blackmailed into it\".{{r|freibergeros19811005}} IBM was correct, nonetheless, in its expectation; one survey found that 96.3% of PCs were ordered with the $40 DOS compared to 3.4% for the $240 CP/M-86.<ref name=\"pcommuniques198302\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7wCiNAUEuAMC&lpg=PA360&pg=PA53#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=PCommuniques | work=PC Magazine | date=February 1983 | accessdate=21 October 2013 | page=53}}</ref>\n\nThe IBM PC's ROM BASIC and BIOS supported cassette tape storage. PC DOS itself did not support cassette tape storage. PC DOS version 1.00 supported only 160&nbsp;kB SSDD floppies, but version 1.1, which was released nine months after the PC's introduction, supported 160&nbsp;kB SSDD and 320&nbsp;kB DSDD floppies. Support for the slightly larger nine sector per track 180&nbsp;kB and 360&nbsp;kB formats arrived 10 months later in March 1983.\n\n===BIOS===\nThe [[BIOS]] (Basic Input/Output System) provided the core ROM code for the PC. It contained a library of functions that software could call for basic tasks such as video output, keyboard input, and disk access in addition to interrupt handling, loading the operating system on boot-up, and testing memory and other system components.\n\nThe original IBM PC BIOS was 8k in size and occupied four 2k ROM chips on the motherboard, with a fifth and sixth empty slot left for any extra ROMs the user wished to install. IBM offered three different BIOS revisions during the PC's lifespan. The initial BIOS was dated April 1981 and came on the earliest models with single-sided floppy drives and PC DOS 1.00. The second version was dated October 1981 and arrived on the \"Revision B\" models sold with double-sided drives and PC DOS 1.10. It corrected some bugs, but was otherwise unchanged. Finally, the third BIOS version was dated October 1982 and found on all IBM PCs with the newer 64k-256k motherboard. This revision was more-or-less identical to the XT's BIOS. It added support for detecting ROMs on expansion cards as well as the ability to use 640k of memory (the earlier BIOS revisions had a limit of 544k). Unlike the XT, the original PC remained functionally unchanged from 1983 until its discontinuation in early 1987 and did not get support for 101-key keyboards or 3.5\" floppy drives, nor was it ever offered with half-height floppies.\n\n===Video output===\nIBM initially offered two video adapters for the PC, the [[Color Graphics Adapter|Color/Graphics Adapter]] and the [[Monochrome Display and Printer Adapter]]. CGA was intended to be a typical home computer display; it had NTSC output and could be connected to a composite monitor or a TV set with an RF modulator in addition to RGB for digital RGBI-type monitors, although IBM did not offer their own RGB monitor until 1983. Supported graphics modes were 40 or 80\u00d725 color text with 8\u00d78 character resolution, 320\u00d7200 bitmap graphics with two fixed 4-color palettes, or 640\u00d7200 monochrome graphics.\n\nThe MDA card and its companion 5151 monitor supported only 80\u00d725 text with a 9\u00d714 character resolution (total pixel resolution was 720\u00d7350). It was mainly intended for the business market and so also included a printer port.\n\nDuring 1982, the first third-party video card for the PC appeared when Hercules Computer Technologies released a clone of the MDA that could use bitmap graphics. Although not supported by the BIOS, the [[Hercules Graphics Card|Hercules Graphics Adapter]] became extremely popular for business use due to allowing sharp, high resolution graphics plus text and itself was widely cloned by other manufacturers.\n\nIn 1985, after the launch of the IBM AT, the new [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter]] became available which could support 320\u00d7200 or 640\u00d7200 in 16 colors in addition to high-resolution 640\u00d7350 16 color graphics.\n\nIBM also offered a video board for the PC, XT, and AT known as the [[Professional Graphics Adapter]] during 1984\u201386, mainly intended for CAD design. It was extremely expensive, required a special monitor, and was rarely ordered by customers.\n\n[[VGA]] graphics cards could also be installed in IBM PCs and XTs, although they were introduced after the computer's discontinuation.\n\n===Serial port addresses and interrupts===\nThe [[serial port]] is an [[8250 UART|8250]] or a derivative (such as the 16450 or [[16550 UART|16550]]), mapped to eight consecutive IO addresses and one interrupt request line.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! COM port\n! IRQ\n! Base port address &#91;[[Hexadecimal|Hex]]&#93;\n|-\n| COM1\n| IRQ4\n| 3F8\n|-\n| COM2\n| IRQ3\n| 2F8\n|-\n| COM3\n| IRQ4\n| 3E8\n|-\n| COM4\n| IRQ3\n| 2E8\n|}\n\nOnly COM1: and COM2: addresses were defined by the original PC. Attempts to share IRQ3 and IRQ4 to use additional ports require special measures in hardware and software, since shared IRQs were not defined in the original PC design. The most typical devices plugged into the serial port were [[modem]]s and [[mouse (computing)|mice]]. [[Plotter]]s and serial printers were also among the more commonly used serial peripherals, and there were numerous other more unusual uses such as operating [[cash register]]s, factory equipment, and connecting [[Computer terminal|terminal]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/pc-hardware-in/0596003536/ch01s03.html|title=System Resources - PC Hardware in a Nutshell, Second Edition [Book]|website=www.oreilly.com|language=en|access-date=2019-05-03}}</ref>\n\n===Printer port===\nIBM made a deal with Japan-based [[Epson]] to produce printers for the PC and all IBM-branded printers were manufactured by that company (Epson of course also sold printers with their own name). There was a considerable amount of controversy when IBM included a printer port on the PC that did not follow the industry-standard [[Centronics]] design, and it was rumored that this had been done to prevent customers from using non-Epson/IBM printers with their machines (plugging a Centronics printer into an IBM PC could damage the printer, the parallel port, or both). Although third-party cards were available with Centronics ports on them, PC clones quickly copied the IBM printer port and by the late 80s, it had largely displaced the Centronics standard.\n\n==Reception==\n''BYTE'' wrote in October 1981 that the IBM PC's \"hardware is impressive, but even more striking are two decisions made by IBM: to use outside suppliers already established in the microcomputer industry, and to provide information and assistance to independent, small-scale software writers and manufacturers of peripheral devices\". It praised the \"smart\" hardware design and stated that its price was not much higher than the 8-bit machines from Apple and others. The reviewer admitted that the computer \"came as a shock. I expected that the giant would stumble by overestimating or underestimating the capabilities the public wants and stubbornly insisting on incompatibility with the rest of the microcomputer world. But IBM didn't stumble at all; instead, the giant jumped leagues in front of the competition\". He concluded that \"the only disappointment about the IBM Personal Computer is its dull name\".<ref name=\"lemmons198110\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1981-10/1981_10_BYTE_06-10_Local_Networks#page/n27/mode/2up | title=The IBM Personal Computer / First Impressions | work=BYTE | date=October 1981 | accessdate=19 October 2013 | author=Lemmons, Phil | page=36}}</ref>\n\nIn a more detailed review in January 1982, ''BYTE'' called the IBM PC \"a synthesis of the best the microcomputer industry has offered to date ... as well designed on the inside as it is on the outside\". The magazine praised the keyboard as \"bar none, the best ... on any microcomputer\", describing the unusual Shift key locations as \"minor [problems] compared to some of the gigantic mistakes made on almost every other microcomputer keyboard\". The review also complimented IBM's manuals, which it predicted \"will set the standard for all microcomputer documentation in the future. Not only are they well packaged, well organized, and easy to understand, but they are also ''complete''\". Observing that detailed technical information was available \"much earlier ... than it has been for other machines\", the magazine predicted that \"given a reasonable period of time, plenty of hardware and software will probably be developed for\" the computer. The review stated that although the IBM PC cost more than comparably configured Apple II and TRS-80 computers, and the insufficient number of slots for all desirable expansion cards was its most serious weakness, \"you get a ''lot'' more for your money\". He concluded, \"In two years or so, I think [it] will be one of the most popular and best-supported ... IBM should be proud of the people who designed it\".<ref name=\"williams198201\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1982-01/1982_01_BYTE_07-01_The_IBM_Personal_Computer#page/n37/mode/2up | title=A Closer Look at the IBM Personal Computer | work=BYTE | date=January 1982 | accessdate=19 October 2013 | author=Williams, Gregg | page=36}}</ref>\n\nIn a special 1984 issue dedicated to the IBM PC, ''BYTE'' concluded that the PC had succeeded both because of its features like an 80-column screen, open architecture, and high-quality keyboard, and \"the failure of other major companies to provide these same fundamental features earlier.

In June 2006, IBM PC and XT models were still in use at the majority of U.S. [[National Weather Service]] upper-air observing sites, used to process data as it is returned from the ascending [[radiosonde]], attached to a [[weather balloon]], although they have been slowly phased out. Factors that have contributed to the 5150 PC's longevity are its flexible modular design, its open technical standard (making information needed to adapt, modify, and repair it readily available), use of few special nonstandard parts, and rugged high-standard IBM manufacturing, which provided for exceptional long-term reliability and durability.\n\nSome of the mechanical aspects of the slot specifications are still used in current PCs. A few systems still come with PS/2 style keyboard and mouse connectors.\n\n==Collectability==\nThe IBM model 5150 Personal Computer has become a collectable among vintage computer collectors, due to the system being the first true \u201cPC\u201d as we know them today. {{As of|2007}}, the system had a market value of $50\u2013$500.<ref name=\"McCracken2007\">{{cite web|last1=McCracken|first1=Harry|title=The Most Collectible PCs of All Time|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/136242/article.html|website=PCWorld|accessdate=25 September 2017|language=en|date=27 August 2007}}</ref>  The IBM model 5150 has proven to be reliable; despite their age of 30 years or more, some still function as they did when new.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/237878/can_you_do_real_work_with_the_30yearold_ibm_5150.html|title=Can You Do Real Work With the 30-Year-Old IBM 5150?|publisher=|date=2011-08-11}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[386SLC]]\n*[[Macintosh|Apple Macintosh]]\n*[[Amiga|Commodore Amiga]]\n*[[Atari ST]]\n*[[Conventional memory]]\n*[[IBM 5120]]\n*[[IBM Aptiva]]\n*[[IBM PCjr]]\n*[[IBM Portable Personal Computer]]\n*[[Token ring|IBM token ring]] networks\n*[[Input/Output Base Address]]\n*[[List of IBM products]]\n*[[ThinkCentre]]\n*[[ThinkPad]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n;Cited references\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n;General references\n{{Refbegin}}\n*Norton, Peter (1986).

Very little is known about his life, other than he lived in Watery Lane, [[Tipton]], Staffordshire.
