It was the main residence of the emperors of the [[Mughal Dynasty]] until 1638, when the capital was shifted from Agra to [[Delhi]]. Before capture by the British, the last Indian rulers to have occupied it were the Marathas. In 1983, the Agra fort was inscribed as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Agra Fort - World HeritageCentre|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/251|website= UNESCO.ORG}}</ref> It is about 2.5&nbsp;km northwest of its more famous sister monument, the [[Taj Mahal]]. The fort can be more accurately described as a walled cities.\n\nIt had been used by the early mughal rulers. The Fort stands on an ancient site and was traditionally known as ''Badalgarh.'' It was captured by Ghaznavi for some time but in the 15th century A.D. the [[Chauhan]] [[Rajput|Rajputs]] occupied it. Soon after, Agra assumed the status of capital when [[Sikandar Lodi]] (A.D. 1487&ndash;1517) shifted his capital from Delhi and constructed a few buildings in the pre-existing Fort at Agra. After the first battle of Panipat (A.D. 1526) Mughals captured the fort and ruled from it. In A.D. 1530, [[Humayun]] was crowned in it. The Fort got its present appearance during the reign of Akbar (A.D. 1556&ndash;1605).\n\n==History==\n[[File:Maharaja Hemu Bhargava - Victor of Twenty Two Pitched Battles, 1910s.jpg|thumb|left|Agra Fort captured by [[Hemu]] before the [[Battle of Delhi (1556)]].]]\nAfter the [[First Battle of Panipat]] in 1526, [[Babur]] stayed in the fort, in the palace of Ibrahim Lodi. He later built a [[baoli]] (step well) in it. His successor, [[Humayun]], was crowned in the fort in 1530. He was defeated at [[Bilgram]] in 1540 by [[Sher Shah Suri]]. The fort remained with the Suris till 1555, when Humayun recaptured it. [[Adil Shah Suri]]'s general, [[Hemu]], recaptured Agra in 1556 and pursued its fleeing governor to Delhi where he met the Mughals in the [[Battle of Tughlaqabad]].<ref name=\"jnsarkar\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qoRDAAAAYAAJ | title=Military History of India | publisher=Orient Longman | last=Sarkar | first=Jadunath | authorlink=Jadunath Sarkar | year=1960 | pages=66\u201367}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Diwan-E-Aam Inside.JPG|thumb|''Diwan-i-Aam'', Hall of Public Audience]]\n[[File:Sheeshmahal.jpg|thumb|Effect produced by lighting candles in Sheesh Mahal, Agra Fort.]]\nRealising the importance of its central situation, Akbar made it his capital and arrived in Agra in 1558. His historian, [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abul Fazl]], recorded that this was a brick fort known as 'Badalgarh'. It was in a ruined condition and Akbar had it rebuilt with red [[sandstone]] from Barauli area Dhaulpur district, in [[Rajasthan]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Architects laid the foundation and it was built with bricks in the inner core with sandstone on external surfaces. Some 4,000 builders worked on it daily for eight years, completing it in 1573.<ref>https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.55649/page/n381/mode/1up</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://asi.nic.in/asi_monu_whs_agrafort.asp |title=Agra Fort (1983), Uttar Pradesh \u2013 Archaeological Survey of India |accessdate=19 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091203060952/http://www.asi.nic.in/asi_monu_whs_agrafort.asp |archive-date=3 December 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIt was only during the reign of Akbar's grandson, [[Shah Jahan]], that the site took on its current state. Shah Jahan built the beautiful Taj Mahal in the memory of his wife, [[Mumtaz Mahal]]. Unlike his grandfather, Shah Jahan tended to have buildings made from [[white marble]]. He destroyed some of the earlier buildings inside the fort to make his own.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nThe fort was under the Jat rulers of Bharatpur for 13 Years. In the fort, they built the Ratan Singh ki haveli. The fort was invaded and captured by the [[Maratha Empire]] in the early 18th century. Thereafter, it changed hands between the Marathas and their foes many times. After their catastrophic defeat at [[Third Battle of Panipat]] by [[Ahmad Shah Abdali]] in 1761, Marathas remained out of the region for the next decade. Finally [[Mahadji Shinde]] took the fort in 1785. It was lost by the Marathas to the [[East India Company|British]] during the [[Second Anglo-Maratha War]], in 1803.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nThe fort was the site of a battle during the [[Indian rebellion of 1857]], which caused the end of the [[British East India Company]]'s rule in India, and led to a century of direct rule of India by [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n==Layout==\n[[File:Plan du fort d'Agra (1901).jpg|thumb|widthpx|Plan of the Red Fort, Agra from [[Murray's Handbooks for Travellers]] 1911]]\nThe {{convert|380000|m2|acre|adj=on|abbr=on}} fort has a semicircular plan, its chord lies parallel to the river Yamuna and its walls are seventy feet high. Double ramparts have massive circular bastions at intervals, with [[battlements]], [[embrasures]], [[machicolations]] and string courses. Four gates were provided on its four sides, one Khizri gate opening on to the river.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nTwo of the fort's gates are notable: the \"Delhi Gate\" and the \"Lahore Gate.\" The Lahore Gate is also popularly also known as the \"Amar Singh Gate,\" for [[Amar Singh Rathore]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nThe monumental Delhi Gate, which faces the city on the western side of the fort, is considered the grandest of the four gates and a masterpiece of [[Akbar]]'s time. It was built circa 1568 both to enhance security and as the king's formal gate, and includes features related to both. It is embellished with intricate inlay work in [[white marble]]. A wooden [[drawbridge]] was used to cross the moat and reach the gate from the mainland; inside, an inner gateway called Hathi Pol (\"Elephant Gate\") \u2013 guarded by two life-sized stone [[elephants]] with their riders \u2013 added another layer of security. The drawbridge, slight ascent, and 90-degree turn between the outer and inner gates make the entrance impregnable. During a siege, attackers would employ elephants to crush a fort's gates. Without a level, straight run-up to gather speed, however, that thing is prevented by this layout.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nBecause the [[Indian military]] (the [[50th Parachute Brigade (India)|Parachute Brigade]] in particular) is still using the northern portion of the Agra Fort, the Delhi Gate cannot be used by the public. Tourists enter via the Amar Singh Gate.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nThe site is very important in terms of architectural history. [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abul Fazal]] recorded that five hundred buildings in the beautiful designs of [[Bengal]] and [[Gujarat]] were built in the fort. Some of them were demolished by [[Shah Jahan]] to make way for his white marble palaces. Most of the others were destroyed by the British troops of East India Company between 1803 and 1862 for raising barracks. Hardly thirty Mughal buildings have survived on the south-eastern side, facing the river, such as the Delhi Gate and Akbar Gate and one palace \u2013 \"Bengali Mahal\".\n\nAkbar Darwazza (Akbar Gate) was renamed Amar Singh Gate by Shah Jahan.  The gate is similar in design to the Delhi Gate. Both are built of red sandstone.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nThe Bengali Mahal is built of red sandstone and is now split into [[Akbari Mahal]] and [[Jahangiri Mahal]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n== Other Historic sites inside Agra Fort ==\n\n* '''Jahangir's Hauz''' (tank) A.D. 1610: This monolithic tank (hauz) was used for bathing. It is 5 feet high, 8 feet in diameter and 25 feet in circumference. On the external side of the rim there is an inscription in Persian which mentions it as ''<nowiki/>'Hauz-e-Jahangir''<nowiki/>'. It was first discovered near the courtyard of Akbar's palace. In A.D. 1843 and later it was placed in front of Diwan-e-Am. In 1862, it was shifted to public garden (Company Bagh) where it suffered much damage. Later, Sir John Marshall brought it back to Agra Fort and placed there. Due to this hauz, the palace became famous as Jahangiri Mahal though it is part of Akbar's Bengali mahal.\n* '''Shahjahani Mahal''' (1628-35 A.D.): It is situated in between the white marble Khas Mahal and the red stone Jahangiri Mahal and is set transitionally in between these two residential complexes of two different ages. It is the earliest attempt of the Mughal emperor Shahjahan to convert an existing red stone building in accordance with his taste and it was his earliest palace in Agra Fort. It has a large hall, side rooms and an octagonal tower on the riverside. The skeletal construction of brick and red stone was all redone with a thick white stucco plaster and colourfully painted in floral designs. The whole palace once glistened white like white marble. On the face towards the Khas Mahal, is a large spacious white marble dalan, composed of five arches, supported on double pillars and protected externally by a chhajja. Its closed western bay houses, the Ghaznin gate, Babur's baoli and a well are situated beneath it. \n*'''Ghaznin Gate''' (1030 A.D.): The gate originally belonged to the tomb of Mahmud Ghaznavi at Ghazni. It was brought from there by the British in1842. Lord Ellenborough, the Governor General, in historic proclamation claimed, that these were the sandalwood gates of Somnath which Mahmud had taken to Ghazni in 1025, and the British had thus avenged an insult of 800 years back. This false claim was made just to win the goodwill of the Indian people. The gate is, in fact, made of local deodar wood of Ghazni and not of sandalwood. The style of decoration bears no resemblance to ancient Gujrati woodwork. There is also an Arabic inscription carved on the upper part. It mentions Mahmud with his epithets. Sir John Marshall had placed here a notice-board which described the whole episode about this gate. It is 16.5 feet high and 13.5 feet broad and its wight is about half a ton. It is made up of geometrical, hexagonal and octagonal panels which have been fixed, one with the help of the other into the frame without rivets. The idea to restore it at Somnath was ultimately given up and the gate was abandoned. Since then, it is stored in a room. \n*'''Jahangir's Chain of Justice''' (C. 1605 A.D.): This is the spot where Mughal king Jahangir instituted his 'chain of justice'(Zanjir-i-Adl) in c. 1605 A.D. He records in his memoir that after his accession, the first order he gave, \"was for the fastening up of the chain of justice so that if those engaged in the administration of justice should delay or practice hypocrisy, the aggrieved might come to this chain and shake it so that its noise might attract my attention.\" It was made of pure gold. It was 80' in length and had 60 bells. Its weight was 1 Quintal. One end was fastened to the battlements of the Shah-Burj and the other end to a stone post on the bank of the river. This is not a myth. Contemporary foreign travellers like William Hawkins personally saw it. It has also been depicted in a contemporary painting made in 1620 A.D. This was a way to redress the grievances of the people who could approach the king, the highest judicial authority of the empire, directly, without fee, fear or formality for immediate relief. There was no distinction of caste or creed or between poor and rich. Jahangir's administration of justice 'Adl-i-Jahangir' became a legend in Indian history.\n*'''The Muthamman Burj''' (Shah-Burj) & '''Jharokha''' (1632 -1640 A.D.): This beautiful palace surmounts the largest bastion of Agra Fort on the riverside, facing the East. It was originally built of red stone by Akbar who used it for jharokha darshan, as well as for sun worship, everyday at sunrise. Jehangir also used it as jharokha, as is faithfully shown in his painting made in 1620. He also instituted his 'Adl-i-Janjir'(the chain of justice) on its south side. Owing to its octagonal plan, it was called 'Muthamman Burj'. It has also been mentioned as 'Shah-Burj'(the imperial or king's tower) by Persian historians and foreign travellers. Its name jasmine tower or 'Samman-Burj' as recorded by the contemporary historian Lahauri is a misnomer. It was rebuilt with white marble by Shah Jehan around 1632-1640 A.D. He also used it for jharokha darshan which was an indispensable a Mughal institution as was 'Durbar'. It is an octagonal building, five external sides of which make a dalan overlooking the river. Each side has pillar and bracket openings, the eastern most side projects forward and accommodates a jharokha majestically. On the western side of this palace is a spacious dalan with Shah-Nasin (alcoves). A shallow water-basin (kunda) is sunk in its pavement. It is profusely inlaid. This dalan opens on a court which has a chabutara projected by a jali screen, on its northern side, a series of rooms leading to Shish Mahal on its western side; and a colonnade (dalan) with a room attached to its on the southern side. It is, thus, a large complex entirely built of white marble. It has deep niches on the walls, to break the monotony. Dados have repetitive stylized creepers inlaid on borders and carved plants on the centre pillars, brackets and lintels also bear exquisitely inlaid designs and it is one of the most ornamented buildings of Shah Jehan. This palace is directly connected to the Diwan-i-Khas, Shish Mahal, Khas Mahal, and other palaces. and it was from here that the Mughal emperor governed the whole country. This burj offers full and majestic view of Taj Mahal and Shah Jehan spent eight years (1658-1666 A.D.) of his imprisonment in this complex, and it is said that he died here. His body was taken by boat to the Taj Mahal and buried.\n*'''Shish Mahal''' (A.D. 1631-40): It was built by Mughal Emperor Shahjahan as a part of summer palace. Its most distinctive feature is glass mosaic work done on its walls and ceiling. These glass pieces have high mirror quality which glittered and twinkled in thousand ways in semi-dark interior. The glass was imported from Haleb of Syria. Shahjahan built glass palace also at Lahore and Delhi, but this is the finest of all.  \n\n==In popular culture==\n*The Agra Fort won the [[Aga Khan Award for Architecture]] in 2004.

It was the main residence of the emperors of the [[Mughal Dynasty]] until 1638, when the capital was shifted from Agra to [[Delhi]]. Before capture by the British, the last Indian rulers to have occupied it were the Marathas. In 1983, the Agra fort was inscribed as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Agra Fort - World HeritageCentre|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/251|website= UNESCO.ORG}}</ref> It is about 2.5&nbsp;km northwest of its more famous sister monument, the [[Taj Mahal]]. The fort can be more accurately described as a walled cities.\n\nIt had been used by the early mughal rulers. The Fort stands on an ancient site and was traditionally known as ''Badalgarh.'' It was captured by Ghaznavi for some time but in the 15th century A.D. the [[Chauhan]] [[Rajput|Rajputs]] occupied it. Soon after, Agra assumed the status of capital when [[Sikandar Lodi]] (A.D. 1487&ndash;1517) shifted his capital from Delhi and constructed a few buildings in the pre-existing Fort at Agra. After the first battle of Panipat (A.D. 1526) Mughals captured the fort and ruled from it. In A.D. 1530, [[Humayun]] was crowned in it. The Fort got its present appearance during the reign of Akbar (A.D. 1556&ndash;1605).\n\n==History==\n[[File:Maharaja Hemu Bhargava - Victor of Twenty Two Pitched Battles, 1910s.jpg|thumb|left|Agra Fort captured by [[Hemu]] before the [[Battle of Delhi (1556)]].]]\nAfter the [[First Battle of Panipat]] in 1526, [[Babur]] stayed in the fort, in the palace of Ibrahim Lodi. He later built a [[baoli]] (step well) in it. His successor, [[Humayun]], was crowned in the fort in 1530. He was defeated at [[Bilgram]] in 1540 by [[Sher Shah Suri]]. The fort remained with the Suris till 1555, when Humayun recaptured it. [[Adil Shah Suri]]'s general, [[Hemu]], recaptured Agra in 1556 and pursued its fleeing governor to Delhi where he met the Mughals in the [[Battle of Tughlaqabad]].<ref name=\"jnsarkar\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qoRDAAAAYAAJ | title=Military History of India | publisher=Orient Longmans | last=Sarkar | first=Jadunath | authorlink=Jadunath Sarkar | year=1960 | pages=66\u201367}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Diwan-E-Aam Inside.JPG|thumb|''Diwan-i-Aam'', Hall of Public Audience]]\n[[File:Sheeshmahal.jpg|thumb|Effect produced by lighting candles in Sheesh Mahal, Agra Fort.]]\nRealising the importance of its central situation, Akbar made it his capital and arrived in Agra in 1558. His historian, [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abul Fazl]], recorded that this was a brick fort known as 'Badalgarh'. It was in a ruined condition and Akbar had it rebuilt with red [[sandstone]] from Barauli area Dhaulpur district, in [[Rajasthan]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Architects laid the foundation and it was built with bricks in the inner core with sandstone on external surfaces. Some 4,000 builders worked on it daily for eight years, completing it in 1573.<ref>https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.55649/page/n381/mode/1up</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://asi.nic.in/asi_monu_whs_agrafort.asp |title=Agra Fort (1983), Uttar Pradesh \u2013 Archaeological Survey of India |accessdate=19 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091203060952/http://www.asi.nic.in/asi_monu_whs_agrafort.asp |archive-date=3 December 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIt was only during the reign of Akbar's grandson, [[Shah Jahan]], that the site took on its current state. Shah Jahan built the beautiful Taj Mahal in the memory of his wife, [[Mumtaz Mahal]]. Unlike his grandfather, Shah Jahan tended to have buildings made from [[white marble]]. He destroyed some of the earlier buildings inside the fort to make his own.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nThe fort was under the Jat rulers of Bharatpur for 13 Years. In the fort, they built the Ratan Singh ki haveli. The fort was invaded and captured by the [[Maratha Empire]] in the early 18th century. Thereafter, it changed hands between the Marathas and their foes many times. After their catastrophic defeat at [[Third Battle of Panipat]] by [[Ahmad Shah Abdali]] in 1761, Marathas remained out of the region for the next decade. Finally [[Mahadji Shinde]] took the fort in 1785. It was lost by the Marathas to the [[East India Company|British]] during the [[Second Anglo-Maratha War]], in 1803.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nThe fort was the site of a battle during the [[Indian rebellion of 1857]], which caused the end of the [[British East India Company]]'s rule in India, and led to a century of direct rule of India by [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n==Layout==\n[[File:Plan du fort d'Agra (1901).jpg|thumb|widthpx|Plan of the Red Fort, Agra from [[Murray's Handbooks for Travellers]] 1911]]\nThe {{convert|380000|m2|acre|adj=on|abbr=on}} fort has a semicircular plan, its chord lies parallel to the river Yamuna and its walls are seventy feet high. Double ramparts have massive circular bastions at intervals, with [[battlements]], [[embrasures]], [[machicolations]] and string courses. Four gates were provided on its four sides, one Khizri gate opening on to the river.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nTwo of the fort's gates are notable: the \"Delhi Gate\" and the \"Lahore Gate.\" The Lahore Gate is also popularly also known as the \"Amar Singh Gate,\" for [[Amar Singh Rathore]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nThe monumental Delhi Gate, which faces the city on the western side of the fort, is considered the grandest of the four gates and a masterpiece of [[Akbar]]'s time. It was built circa 1568 both to enhance security and as the king's formal gate, and includes features related to both. It is embellished with intricate inlay work in [[white marble]]. A wooden [[drawbridge]] was used to cross the moat and reach the gate from the mainland; inside, an inner gateway called Hathi Pol (\"Elephant Gate\") \u2013 guarded by two life-sized stone [[elephants]] with their riders \u2013 added another layer of security. The drawbridge, slight ascent, and 90-degree turn between the outer and inner gates make the entrance impregnable. During a siege, attackers would employ elephants to crush a fort's gates. Without a level, straight run-up to gather speed, however, that thing is prevented by this layout.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nBecause the [[Indian military]] (the [[50th Parachute Brigade (India)|Parachute Brigade]] in particular) is still using the northern portion of the Agra Fort, the Delhi Gate cannot be used by the public. Tourists enter via the Amar Singh Gate.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nThe site is very important in terms of architectural history. [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abul Fazal]] recorded that five hundred buildings in the beautiful designs of [[Bengal]] and [[Gujarat]] were built in the fort. Some of them were demolished by [[Shah Jahan]] to make way for his white marble palaces. Most of the others were destroyed by the British troops of East India Company between 1803 and 1862 for raising barracks. Hardly thirty Mughal buildings have survived on the south-eastern side, facing the river, such as the Delhi Gate and Akbar Gate and one palace \u2013 \"Bengali Mahal\".\n\nAkbar Darwazza (Akbar Gate) was renamed Amar Singh Gate by Shah Jahan.  The gate is similar in design to the Delhi Gate. Both are built of red sandstone.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nThe Bengali Mahal is built of red sandstone and is now split into [[Akbari Mahal]] and [[Jahangiri Mahal]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n== Other Historic sites inside Agra Fort ==\n\n* '''Jahangir's Hauz''' (tank) A.D. 1610: This monolithic tank (hauz) was used for bathing. It is 5 feet high, 8 feet in diameter and 25 feet in circumference. On the external side of the rim there is an inscription in Persian which mentions it as ''<nowiki/>'Hauz-e-Jahangir''<nowiki/>'. It was first discovered near the courtyard of Akbar's palace. In A.D. 1843 and later it was placed in front of Diwan-e-Am. In 1862, it was shifted to public garden (Company Bagh) where it suffered much damage. Later, Sir John Marshall brought it back to Agra Fort and placed there. Due to this hauz, the palace became famous as Jahangiri Mahal though it is part of Akbar's Bengali mahal.\n* '''Shahjahani Mahal''' (1628-35 A.D.): It is situated in between the white marble Khas Mahal and the red stone Jahangiri Mahal and is set transitionally in between these two residential complexes of two different ages. It is the earliest attempt of the Mughal emperor Shahjahan to convert an existing red stone building in accordance with his taste and it was his earliest palace in Agra Fort. It has a large hall, side rooms and an octagonal tower on the riverside. The skeletal construction of brick and red stone was all redone with a thick white stucco plaster and colourfully painted in floral designs. The whole palace once glistened white like white marble. On the face towards the Khas Mahal, is a large spacious white marble dalan, composed of five arches, supported on double pillars and protected externally by a chhajja. Its closed western bay houses, the Ghaznin gate, Babur's baoli and a well are situated beneath it. \n*'''Ghaznin Gate''' (1030 A.D.): The gate originally belonged to the tomb of Mahmud Ghaznavi at Ghazni. It was brought from there by the British in1842. Lord Ellenborough, the Governor General, in historic proclamation claimed, that these were the sandalwood gates of Somnath which Mahmud had taken to Ghazni in 1025, and the British had thus avenged an insult of 800 years back. This false claim was made just to win the goodwill of the Indian people. The gate is, in fact, made of local deodar wood of Ghazni and not of sandalwood. The style of decoration bears no resemblance to ancient Gujrati woodwork. There is also an Arabic inscription carved on the upper part. It mentions Mahmud with his epithets. Sir John Marshall had placed here a notice-board which described the whole episode about this gate. It is 16.5 feet high and 13.5 feet broad and its wight is about half a ton. It is made up of geometrical, hexagonal and octagonal panels which have been fixed, one with the help of the other into the frame without rivets. The idea to restore it at Somnath was ultimately given up and the gate was abandoned. Since then, it is stored in a room. \n*'''Jahangir's Chain of Justice''' (C. 1605 A.D.): This is the spot where Mughal king Jahangir instituted his 'chain of justice'(Zanjir-i-Adl) in c. 1605 A.D. He records in his memoir that after his accession, the first order he gave, \"was for the fastening up of the chain of justice so that if those engaged in the administration of justice should delay or practice hypocrisy, the aggrieved might come to this chain and shake it so that its noise might attract my attention.\" It was made of pure gold. It was 80' in length and had 60 bells. Its weight was 1 Quintal. One end was fastened to the battlements of the Shah-Burj and the other end to a stone post on the bank of the river. This is not a myth. Contemporary foreign travellers like William Hawkins personally saw it. It has also been depicted in a contemporary painting made in 1620 A.D. This was a way to redress the grievances of the people who could approach the king, the highest judicial authority of the empire, directly, without fee, fear or formality for immediate relief. There was no distinction of caste or creed or between poor and rich. Jahangir's administration of justice 'Adl-i-Jahangir' became a legend in Indian history.\n*'''The Muthamman Burj''' (Shah-Burj) & '''Jharokha''' (1632 -1640 A.D.): This beautiful palace surmounts the largest bastion of Agra Fort on the riverside, facing the East. It was originally built of red stone by Akbar who used it for jharokha darshan, as well as for sun worship, everyday at sunrise. Jehangir also used it as jharokha, as is faithfully shown in his painting made in 1620. He also instituted his 'Adl-i-Janjir'(the chain of justice) on its south side. Owing to its octagonal plan, it was called 'Muthamman Burj'. It has also been mentioned as 'Shah-Burj'(the imperial or king's tower) by Persian historians and foreign travellers. Its name jasmine tower or 'Samman-Burj' as recorded by the contemporary historian Lahauri is a misnomer. It was rebuilt with white marble by Shah Jehan around 1632-1640 A.D. He also used it for jharokha darshan which was an indispensable a Mughal institution as was 'Durbar'. It is an octagonal building, five external sides of which make a dalan overlooking the river. Each side has pillar and bracket openings, the eastern most side projects forward and accommodates a jharokha majestically. On the western side of this palace is a spacious dalan with Shah-Nasin (alcoves). A shallow water-basin (kunda) is sunk in its pavement. It is profusely inlaid. This dalan opens on a court which has a chabutara projected by a jali screen, on its northern side, a series of rooms leading to Shish Mahal on its western side; and a colonnade (dalan) with a room attached to its on the southern side. It is, thus, a large complex entirely built of white marble. It has deep niches on the walls, to break the monotony. Dados have repetitive stylized creepers inlaid on borders and carved plants on the centre pillars, brackets and lintels also bear exquisitely inlaid designs and it is one of the most ornamented buildings of Shah Jehan. This palace is directly connected to the Diwan-i-Khas, Shish Mahal, Khas Mahal, and other palaces. and it was from here that the Mughal emperor governed the whole country. This burj offers full and majestic view of Taj Mahal and Shah Jehan spent eight years (1658-1666 A.D.) of his imprisonment in this complex, and it is said that he died here. His body was taken by boat to the Taj Mahal and buried.\n*'''Shish Mahal''' (A.D. 1631-40): It was built by Mughal Emperor Shahjahan as a part of summer palace. Its most distinctive feature is glass mosaic work done on its walls and ceiling. These glass pieces have high mirror quality which glittered and twinkled in thousand ways in semi-dark interior. The glass was imported from Haleb of Syria. Shahjahan built glass palace also at Lahore and Delhi, but this is the finest of all.  \n\n==In popular culture==\n*The Agra Fort won the [[Aga Khan Award for Architecture]] in 2004.

Indiana borders [[Lake Michigan]] to the northwest, [[Michigan]] to the north, [[Ohio]] to the east, [[Kentucky]] to the south and southeast, and [[Illinois]] to the west.\n\nBefore becoming a territory, various [[indigenous peoples]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] inhabited Indiana for thousands of years. Since its founding as a territory, settlement patterns in Indiana have reflected regional cultural segmentation present in the [[Eastern United States]]; the state's northernmost tier was settled primarily by people from [[New England]] and [[New York (state)|New York]], Central Indiana by migrants from the [[Mid-Atlantic (United States)|Mid-Atlantic]] states and from adjacent Ohio, and [[Southern Indiana]] by settlers from the Southern states, particularly Kentucky and [[Tennessee]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/286017/Indiana/279873/Settlement-patterns-and-demographic-trends |title=Indiana \u2013 Settlement patterns and demographic trends |publisher=eb.com |author1=William Vincent D'Antonio |author2=Robert L.

The people developed new tools as well as techniques to cook food, an important step in civilization. These new tools included different types of spear points and knives, with various forms of [[Nock (arrow)|notches]]. They made ground-stone tools such as stone axes, woodworking tools and grinding stones. During the latter part of the period, they built earthwork [[mound]]s and [[midden]]s, which showed settlements were becoming more permanent. The Archaic period ended at about 1500 BC, although some Archaic people lived until 700 BC.<ref name=\"HIS\"/>\n\nThe [[Woodland period]] began around 1500 BC, when new cultural attributes appeared. The people created ceramics and pottery, and extended their cultivation of plants. An early Woodland period group named the [[Adena culture|Adena people]] had elegant burial rituals, featuring log tombs beneath earth mounds. In the middle of the Woodland period, the [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell people]] began to develop long-range trade of [[Good (economics)|goods]]. Nearing the end of the stage, the people developed highly productive cultivation and adaptation of agriculture, growing such crops as [[Maize|corn]] and [[Squash (plant)|squash]]. The Woodland period ended around 1000 AD.<ref name=\"HIS\"/>\n\nThe [[Mississippian culture]] emerged, lasting from 1000 AD until the 15th century, shortly before the arrival of Europeans. During this stage, the people created large urban settlements designed according to their cosmology, with large mounds and plazas defining ceremonial and public spaces. The concentrated settlements depended on the agricultural surpluses. One such complex was the [[Angel Mounds]]. They had large public areas such as plazas and platform mounds, where leaders lived or conducted rituals. Mississippian civilization collapsed in Indiana during the mid-15th century for reasons that remain unclear.<ref name=\"HIS\"/>\n\nThe historic Native American tribes in the area at the time of European encounter spoke different languages of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] family. They included the [[Shawnee]], [[Miami people|Miami]], and [[Illiniwek|Illini]]. Refugee tribes from eastern regions, including the Delaware who settled in the White and Whitewater River Valleys, later joined them.\n\n===European exploration and sovereignty===\n\n{{Main|New France|Canada (New France)|Louisiana (New France)|Illinois Country|French and Indian War|Treaty of Paris (1763)|Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|Indian Reserve (1763)|American Revolutionary War|Western theater of the American Revolutionary War|Treaty of Paris (1783)}}\n[[File:Natives guiding french explorers through indiana.jpg|thumb|Native Americans guide French explorers through Indiana, as depicted by [[Maurice Thompson]] in ''Stories of Indiana'']]\n\nIn 1679, French explorer [[Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]] was the first European to cross into Indiana after reaching present-day [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]] at the [[St. Joseph River (Lake Michigan)|Saint Joseph River]].<ref>Allison, p. 17.</ref> He returned the following year to learn about the region. French-Canadian [[fur trade]]rs soon arrived, bringing blankets, jewelry, tools, whiskey and weapons to trade for skins with the Native Americans.\n\nBy 1702, [[Louis Juchereau de St. Denis|Sieur Juchereau]] established the first trading post near [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]]. In 1715, [[Jean Baptiste Bissot, Sieur de Vincennes|Sieur de Vincennes]] built [[Fort Miami (Indiana)|Fort Miami]] at [[Kekionga]], now [[Fort Wayne]]. In 1717, another Canadian, [[Picote de Beletre]], built [[Fort Ouiatenon]] on the [[Wabash River]], to try to control Native American trade routes from [[Lake Erie]] to the [[Mississippi River]].\n\nIn 1732, Sieur de Vincennes built a second fur trading post at Vincennes. French Canadian settlers, who had left the earlier post because of hostilities, returned in larger numbers. In a period of a few years, British colonists arrived from the East and contended against the Canadians for control of the lucrative fur trade. Fighting between the French and British colonists occurred throughout the 1750s as a result.\n\nThe Native American tribes of Indiana sided with the French Canadians during the [[French and Indian War]] (also known as the [[Seven Years' War]]). With British victory in 1763, the French were forced to cede to the British crown all their lands in North America east of the Mississippi River and north and west of the [[Thirteen Colonies|colonies]].\n\nThe tribes in Indiana did not give up: they captured [[Fort Ouiatenon]] and [[Forts of Fort Wayne, Indiana#Fort Miami|Fort Miami]] during [[Pontiac's Rebellion]]. The British royal proclamation of 1763 designated the land west of the Appalachians for Native American use, and excluded British colonists from the area, which the Crown called \"Indian Territory\".\n\nIn 1775, the [[American Revolutionary War]] began as the colonists sought self-government and independence from the British. The majority of the fighting took place near the East Coast, but the Patriot military officer [[George Rogers Clark]] called for an army to help fight the British in the west.<ref>Brill, p. 31\u201332.</ref> Clark's army won significant battles and took over [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]] and [[Fort Sackville]] on February 25, 1779.<ref name=\"NO\">{{cite web| title =Northwest Ordinance of 1787 | publisher=State of Indiana| url =http://www.in.gov/history/2695.htm#events| accessdate =July 24, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the war, Clark managed to cut off British troops, who were attacking the eastern colonists from the west. His success is often credited for changing the course of the American Revolutionary War.<ref>Brill, p. 33.</ref> At the end of the war, through the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]], the British crown ceded their claims to the land south of the Great Lakes to the newly formed United States, including Native American lands.\n\n===The frontier===\n\n{{Main|Northwest Ordinance|Northwest Territory|Organic act#List of organic acts|Indiana Territory}}\n{{multiple image | direction = vertical | width = 210\n|image1=Indiana Indian treaties.svg\n|alt1=A colorful map of Indiana with treaty names\n|image2=Indiana, 1817.jpg\n|alt2=A crude map of Indiana with only a handful of southern counties delineated\n|caption2=Above: a map showing extent of the treaty lands.

About half the state was acquired in the [[Treaty of St. Mary's]] from the Miami in 1818. Purchases were not complete until the [[Treaty of Mississinewas]] in 1826 acquired the last of the reserved Native American lands in the northeast.\n\nA portrait of the Indiana frontier about 1810: The frontier was defined by the [[Treaty of Fort Wayne (1809)|Treaty of Fort Wayne]] in 1809, adding much of the southwestern lands around Vincennes and southeastern lands adjacent to Cincinnati, to areas along the Ohio River as part of U.S. territory. Settlements were military outposts such as Fort Ouiatenon in the northwest and Fort Miami (later Fort Wayne) in the northeast, Fort Knox and Vincennes settlement on the lower Wabash. Other settlements included Clarksville (across from Louisville), Vevay, and Corydon along the Ohio River, the Quaker Colony in Richmond on the eastern border, and Conner's Post (later Connersville) on the east central frontier. Indianapolis would not be populated for 15 more years, and central and northern Indiana Territory remained wilderness populated primarily by Indigenous communities. Only two counties in the extreme southeast, Clark and Dearborn, had been organized by European settlers. Land titles issued out of Cincinnati were sparse. Settler migration was chiefly via flatboat on the Ohio River westerly, and by wagon trails up the Wabash/White River Valleys (west) and Whitewater River Valleys (east).\n\nIn 1810, the [[Shawnee]] tribal chief [[Tecumseh]] and his brother [[Tenskwatawa]] encouraged other indigenous tribes in the territory to resist European settlement. Tensions rose and the US authorized Harrison to launch a preemptive expedition against [[Tecumseh's Confederacy]]; the US gained victory at the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]] on November 7, 1811. Tecumseh was killed in 1813 during the [[Battle of Thames]]. After his death, armed resistance to United States control ended in the region. Most Native American tribes in the state were later [[Indian removals in Indiana|removed]] to west of the [[Mississippi River]] in the 1820s and 1830s after US negotiations and the purchase of their lands.<ref>Brill, pp. 36\u201337.</ref>\n\n===Statehood and settlement===\n\n[[File:Historic American Buildings Survey Lester Jones, Photographer May 24, 1940.

The explanation appears to be certain factors in the labor market. First, much of the heavy manufacturing, such as industrial machinery and steel, requires highly skilled labor, and firms are often willing to locate where hard-to-train skills already exist. Second, Indiana's labor force is primarily in medium-sized and smaller cities rather than in very large and expensive metropolises.

The southeastern part of the state is served by the [[Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport]] also across the Ohio River in [[Hebron, Kentucky]]. Most residents of [[Northwest Indiana]], which is primarily in the [[Chicago Metropolitan Area]], use the two Chicago airports, [[O'Hare International Airport]] and [[Chicago Midway International Airport]].\n\n====Highways====\n\n[[File:I-69 Construction Indiana.jpg|thumb|The [[Interstate 69 in Indiana|Interstate 69]] extension project in [[Monroe County, Indiana|Monroe County]]]]\n\nThe major U.S. [[List of Interstate Highways in Indiana|Interstate highways in Indiana]] are [[Interstate 64 in Indiana|I-64]], [[Interstate 65 in Indiana|I-65]], [[Interstate 265 in Indiana|I-265]], [[Interstate 465|I-465]], [[Interstate 865|I-865]], [[Interstate 69 in Indiana|I-69]], [[Interstate 469|I-469]], [[Interstate 70 in Indiana|I-70]], [[Interstate 74 in Indiana|I-74]], [[Interstate 80 in Indiana|I-80]], [[Interstate 90 in Indiana|I-90]], [[Interstate 94 in Indiana|I-94]], and [[Interstate 275 (Ohio\u2013Indiana\u2013Kentucky)|I-275]]. The various highways intersecting in and around [[Indianapolis]], along with its historical status as a major railroad hub, and the canals that once crossed Indiana, are the source of the state's motto, the Crossroads of America. There are also many [[List of U.S. Routes in Indiana|U.S. routes]] and [[List of State Roads in Indiana|state highways]] maintained by the [[Indiana Department of Transportation]]. These are numbered according to the same convention as [[U.S. Highways]]. Indiana allows highways of different classifications to have the same number. For example, I-64 and [[Indiana State Road 64]] both exist (rather close to each other) in Indiana, but are two distinct roads with no relation to one another.\n\nA $3 billion project extending I-69 is underway. The project was divided into six sections, with the first five sections (linking [[Evansville, Indiana|Evansville]] to [[Martinsville, Indiana|Martinsville]]) now complete.

Such systems are easier to implement in the glacially flattened northern and central portions of the state. Rural counties in the southern third of the state are less likely to have grids and more likely to rely on unsystematic road names (for example, Crawford, Harrison, Perry, Scott, and Washington Counties).\n\nThere are also counties in the northern portions of the state that have never implemented a grid, or have only partially implemented one. Some counties are also laid out in an almost diamond-like grid system (e.g., Clark, Floyd, Gibson, and Knox Counties). Such a system is also almost useless in those situations as well. Knox County once operated two different grid systems for county roads because the county was laid out using two different survey grids, but has since decided to use road names and combine roads instead.\n\nNotably, the county road grid system of St. Joseph County, whose major city is South Bend, uses perennial (tree) names (i.e. Ash, Hickory, Ironwood, etc.) in alphabetical order for North-South roads and Presidential and other noteworthy names (i.e., Adams, Edison, Lincoln Way, etc.) in alphabetical order for East-West roads. There are exceptions to this rule in downtown South Bend and Mishawaka. Hamilton county just continues the numbered street system from Downtown Indianapolis from 96th Street at the Marion County line to 296th street at the Tipton County line.\n\n====Rail====\n\n[[File:07 21 09 006xRP - Flickr - drewj1946.jpg|thumb|A [[South Shore Line|South Shore]] commuter train in [[Michigan City, Indiana|Michigan City]]]]\n\nIndiana has more than 4,255 railroad route miles, of which 91 percent are operated by Class I railroads, principally [[CSX Transportation]] and the [[Norfolk Southern Railway]]. Other [[Class I railroad]]s in Indiana include the [[Canadian National Railway]] and [[Soo Line Railroad]], a [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] subsidiary, as well as [[Amtrak]]. The remaining miles are operated by 37 regional, local, and switching and terminal railroads. The [[South Shore Line (NICTD)|South Shore Line]] is one of the country's most notable commuter rail systems, extending from Chicago to [[South Bend]]. Indiana is implementing an extensive rail plan prepared in 2002 by the [[Parsons Corporation]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Indiana Rail Plan | publisher=Indiana Department of Transportation | url=http://www.in.gov/indot/3065.htm}}</ref> Many recreational trails, such as the [[Monon Trail]] and [[Cardinal Greenway]], have been created from [[rails-to-trails|abandoned rails routes]].\n\n====Ports====\n\n[[File:Towboat Ben McCool upbound on Ohio River with two tank barges (1 of 6) 87j082.jpg|thumb|Barges are a common sight along the [[Ohio River]].

In the 1840s, [[Caleb Mills]] pressed the need for tax-supported schools, and in 1851 his advice was included in the new state constitution. In 1843 the Legislature ruled that African Americans could not attend the public schools, leading to the foundation of [[Union Literary Institute]] and other schools for them, funded by donations or the students themselves.\n\nAlthough the growth of the public school system was held up by legal entanglements, many public elementary schools were in use by 1870. Most children in Indiana attend public schools, but nearly 10% attend private schools and [[parochial school]]s. About one-half of all college students in Indiana are enrolled in state-supported four-year schools.\n\nIndiana public schools have gone through several changes throughout Indiana's history. Modern, public school standards, have been implemented all throughout the state. These new standards were adopted in April 2014. The overall goal of these new state standards is to ensure Indiana students have the necessary skills and requirements needed to enter college or the workforce upon high school graduation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Indiana Academic Standards |url=https://www.doe.in.gov/standards |website=Indiana Department of Education |publisher=Indiana Department of Education |accessdate=November 4, 2018}}</ref> State standards can be found for nearly every major subject taught in Indiana public schools.

Its capital and largest city is [[Indianapolis]]. Indiana was admitted to the United States as the 19th U.S. state on December 11, 1816. Indiana borders [[Lake Michigan]] to the northwest, [[Michigan]] to the north, [[Ohio]] to the east, [[Kentucky]] to the south and southeast, and [[Illinois]] to the west.\n\nBefore becoming a territory, various [[indigenous peoples]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] inhabited Indiana for thousands of years. Since its founding as a territory, settlement patterns in Indiana have reflected regional cultural segmentation present in the [[Eastern United States]]; the state's northernmost tier was settled primarily by people from [[New England]] and [[New York (state)|New York]], Central Indiana by migrants from the [[Mid-Atlantic (United States)|Mid-Atlantic]] states and from adjacent Ohio, and [[Southern Indiana]] by settlers from the Southern states, particularly Kentucky and [[Tennessee]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/286017/Indiana/279873/Settlement-patterns-and-demographic-trends |title=Indiana \u2013 Settlement patterns and demographic trends |publisher=eb.com |author1=William Vincent D'Antonio |author2=Robert L.

On May 7, 1800, the [[United States Congress]] passed legislation to divide the [[Northwest Territory]] into two areas and named the western section the [[Indiana Territory]]. In 1816, when Congress passed an Enabling Act to begin the process of establishing statehood for Indiana, a part of this territorial land became the geographic area for the new state.<ref>A portion of the Northwest Territory's eastern section became the state of [[Ohio]] in 1803. The [[Michigan Territory]] was established in 1805 from part of the Indiana Territory's northern lands and four years later, in 1809, the Illinois counties were separated from the Indiana Territory to create the [[Illinois Territory]].

Divided into small groups, the Paleo-Indians were [[nomad]]s who hunted large [[Game (food)|game]] such as [[mastodons]].

The people developed new tools as well as techniques to cook food, an important step in civilization. These new tools included different types of spear points and knives, with various forms of [[Nock (arrow)|notches]]. They made ground-stone tools such as stone axes, woodworking tools and grinding stones. During the latter part of the period, they built earthwork [[mound]]s and [[midden]]s, which showed settlements were becoming more permanent. The Archaic period ended at about 1500 BC, although some Archaic people lived until 700 BC.<ref name=\"HIS\"/>\n\nThe [[Woodland period]] began around 1500 BC, when new cultural attributes appeared. The people created ceramics and pottery, and extended their cultivation of plants. An early Woodland period group named the [[Adena culture|Adena people]] had elegant burial rituals, featuring log tombs beneath earth mounds. In the middle of the Woodland period, the [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell people]] began to develop long-range trade of [[Good (economics)|goods]]. Nearing the end of the stage, the people developed highly productive cultivation and adaptation of agriculture, growing such crops as [[Maize|corn]] and [[Squash (plant)|squash]]. The Woodland period ended around 1000 AD.<ref name=\"HIS\"/>\n\nThe [[Mississippian culture]] emerged, lasting from 1000 AD until the 15th century, shortly before the arrival of Europeans. During this stage, the people created large urban settlements designed according to their cosmology, with large mounds and plazas defining ceremonial and public spaces. The concentrated settlements depended on the agricultural surpluses. One such complex was the [[Angel Mounds]]. They had large public areas such as plazas and platform mounds, where leaders lived or conducted rituals. Mississippian civilization collapsed in Indiana during the mid-15th century for reasons that remain unclear.<ref name=\"HIS\"/>\n\nThe historic Native American tribes in the area at the time of European encounter spoke different languages of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] family. They included the [[Shawnee]], [[Miami people|Miami]], and [[Illiniwek|Illini]]. Refugee tribes from eastern regions, including the Delaware who settled in the White and Whitewater River Valleys, later joined them.\n\n===European exploration and sovereignty===\n\n{{Main|New France|Canada (New France)|Louisiana (New France)|Illinois Country|French and Indian War|Treaty of Paris (1763)|Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|Indian Reserve (1763)|American Revolutionary War|Western theater of the American Revolutionary War|Treaty of Paris (1783)}}\n[[File:Natives guiding french explorers through indiana.jpg|thumb|Native Americans guide French explorers through Indiana, as depicted by [[Maurice Thompson]] in ''Stories of Indiana'']]\n\nIn 1679, French explorer [[Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]] was the first European to cross into Indiana after reaching present-day [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]] at the [[St. Joseph River (Lake Michigan)|Saint Joseph River]].<ref>Allison, p. 17.</ref> He returned the following year to learn about the region. French-Canadian [[fur trade]]rs soon arrived, bringing blankets, jewelry, tools, whiskey and weapons to trade for skins with the Native Americans.\n\nBy 1702, [[Louis Juchereau de St. Denis|Sieur Juchereau]] established the first trading post near [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]]. In 1715, [[Jean Baptiste Bissot, Sieur de Vincennes|Sieur de Vincennes]] built [[Fort Miami (Indiana)|Fort Miami]] at [[Kekionga]], now [[Fort Wayne]]. In 1717, another Canadian, [[Picote de Beletre]], built [[Fort Ouiatenon]] on the [[Wabash River]], to try to control Native American trade routes from [[Lake Erie]] to the [[Mississippi River]].\n\nIn 1732, Sieur de Vincennes built a second fur trading post at Vincennes. French Canadian settlers, who had left the earlier post because of hostilities, returned in larger numbers. In a period of a few years, British colonists arrived from the East and contended against the Canadians for control of the lucrative fur trade. Fighting between the French and British colonists occurred throughout the 1750s as a result.\n\nThe Native American tribes of Indiana sided with the French Canadians during the [[French and Indian War]] (also known as the [[Seven Years' War]]). With British victory in 1763, the French were forced to cede to the British crown all their lands in North America east of the Mississippi River and north and west of the [[Thirteen Colonies|colonies]].\n\nThe tribes in Indiana did not give up: they captured [[Fort Ouiatenon]] and [[Forts of Fort Wayne, Indiana#Fort Miami|Fort Miami]] during [[Pontiac's Rebellion]].

About half the state was acquired in the [[Treaty of St. Mary's]] from the Miami in 1818. Purchases were not complete until the [[Treaty of Mississinewas]] in 1826 acquired the last of the reserved Native American lands in the northeast.\n\nA portrait of the Indiana frontier about 1810: The frontier was defined by the [[Treaty of Fort Wayne (1809)|Treaty of Fort Wayne]] in 1809, adding much of the southwestern lands around Vincennes and southeastern lands adjacent to Cincinnati, to areas along the Ohio River as part of U.S. territory. Settlements were military outposts such as Fort Ouiatenon in the northwest and Fort Miami (later Fort Wayne) in the northeast, Fort Knox and Vincennes settlement on the lower Wabash. Other settlements included Clarksville (across from Louisville), Vevay, and Corydon along the Ohio River, the Quaker Colony in Richmond on the eastern border, and Conner's Post (later Connersville) on the east central frontier. Indianapolis would not be populated for 15 more years, and central and northern Indiana Territory remained wilderness populated primarily by Indigenous communities. Only two counties in the extreme southeast, Clark and Dearborn, had been organized by European settlers. Land titles issued out of Cincinnati were sparse. Settler migration was chiefly via flatboat on the Ohio River westerly, and by wagon trails up the Wabash/White River Valleys (west) and Whitewater River Valleys (east).\n\nIn 1810, the [[Shawnee]] tribal chief [[Tecumseh]] and his brother [[Tenskwatawa]] encouraged other indigenous tribes in the territory to resist European settlement. Tensions rose and the US authorized Harrison to launch a preemptive expedition against [[Tecumseh's Confederacy]]; the US gained victory at the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]] on November 7, 1811. Tecumseh was killed in 1813 during the [[Battle of Thames]]. After his death, armed resistance to United States control ended in the region. Most Native American tribes in the state were later [[Indian removals in Indiana|removed]] to west of the [[Mississippi River]] in the 1820s and 1830s after US negotiations and the purchase of their lands.<ref>Brill, pp. 36\u201337.</ref>\n\n===Statehood and settlement===\n\n[[File:Historic American Buildings Survey Lester Jones, Photographer May 24, 1940.

The explanation appears to be certain factors in the labor market. First, much of the heavy manufacturing, such as industrial machinery and steel, requires highly skilled labor, and firms are often willing to locate where hard-to-train skills already exist. Second, Indiana's labor force is primarily in medium-sized and smaller cities rather than in very large and expensive metropolises. This makes it possible for firms to offer somewhat lower wages for these skills than would normally be paid. Firms often see in Indiana a chance to obtain higher than average skills at lower than average wages.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Manufacturers in Indiana | publisher=Purdue University Center for Rural Development | date=July 19, 1998}}</ref>\n\n===Business===\n\nIn 2016, Indiana was home to seven [[Fortune 500]] companies with a combined $142.5 billion in revenue.<ref>{{cite web|title=Indiana Businesses Shuffle on Fortune 500|first=Dan|last=McGowan|publisher=Inside Indiana Business|url=http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/story/32221981/indiana-businesses-shuffle-around-on-fortune-500|date=June 14, 2016|accessdate=September 1, 2017}}</ref> [[Columbus, Indiana|Columbus]]-based [[Cummins, Inc.]] and Indianapolis-based [[Eli Lilly and Company]] and [[Simon Property Group]] were recognized in ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' publication's \"2017 World's Most Admired Companies List\", ranking in each of their respective industries.<ref>{{cite news|title=3 Indiana companies make Fortune's 2017 World's Most Admired Companies List|first=Allison|last=Carter|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|url=http://www.indystar.com/story/news/2017/02/20/3-indiana-companies-make-fortunes-2017-worlds-most-admired-companies-list/98149374/|date=February 20, 2017|accessdate=September 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Northwest Indiana]] has been the largest steel producing center in the U.S. since 1975 and accounted for 27 percent of American-made steel in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|title=Indiana leads nation in steel production|first=Joseph|last=Pete|publisher=Northwest Indiana Times|url=http://www.nwitimes.com/business/steel/indiana-leads-nation-in-steel-production/article_def40810-528e-5a98-acc2-ebab79de08a2.html|date=May 31, 2017|accessdate=September 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIndiana is home to the international headquarters and research facilities of pharmaceutical company [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]] in Indianapolis, the state's largest corporation, as well as the world headquarters of Mead Johnson Nutritionals in Evansville.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wndu.com/news/112005/news_46007.php|title=WNDU-TV: News Story: Bayer is leaving Elkhart \u2013 November 16, 2005}}</ref> Overall, Indiana ranks fifth among all U.S. states in total sales and shipments of pharmaceutical products and second highest in the number of biopharmaceutical related jobs.<ref>{{cite web | title=Economy & Demographics | publisher=Terre Haute Economic Development Co. | url=http://www.terrehauteareaedc.com/econ_industry.htm | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716101025/http://www.terrehauteareaedc.com/econ_industry.htm | url-status=dead | archive-date=July 16, 2006 | accessdate=January 30, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIndiana is within the U.S. [[Corn Belt]] and [[Grain Belt]].

The southeastern part of the state is served by the [[Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport]] also across the Ohio River in [[Hebron, Kentucky]].

The various highways intersecting in and around [[Indianapolis]], along with its historical status as a major railroad hub, and the canals that once crossed Indiana, are the source of the state's motto, the Crossroads of America. There are also many [[List of U.S. Routes in Indiana|U.S. routes]] and [[List of State Roads in Indiana|state highways]] maintained by the [[Indiana Department of Transportation]]. These are numbered according to the same convention as [[U.S. Highways]]. Indiana allows highways of different classifications to have the same number. For example, I-64 and [[Indiana State Road 64]] both exist (rather close to each other) in Indiana, but are two distinct roads with no relation to one another.\n\nA $3 billion project extending I-69 is underway. The project was divided into six sections, with the first five sections (linking [[Evansville, Indiana|Evansville]] to [[Martinsville, Indiana|Martinsville]]) now complete.

Such systems are easier to implement in the glacially flattened northern and central portions of the state. Rural counties in the southern third of the state are less likely to have grids and more likely to rely on unsystematic road names (for example, Crawford, Harrison, Perry, Scott, and Washington Counties).\n\nThere are also counties in the northern portions of the state that have never implemented a grid, or have only partially implemented one. Some counties are also laid out in an almost diamond-like grid system (e.g., Clark, Floyd, Gibson, and Knox Counties). Such a system is also almost useless in those situations as well. Knox County once operated two different grid systems for county roads because the county was laid out using two different survey grids, but has since decided to use road names and combine roads instead.\n\nNotably, the county road grid system of St. Joseph County, whose major city is South Bend, uses perennial (tree) names (i.e. Ash, Hickory, Ironwood, etc.) in alphabetical order for North-South roads and Presidential and other noteworthy names (i.e., Adams, Edison, Lincoln Way, etc.) in alphabetical order for East-West roads. There are exceptions to this rule in downtown South Bend and Mishawaka. Hamilton county just continues the numbered street system from Downtown Indianapolis from 96th Street at the Marion County line to 296th street at the Tipton County line.\n\n====Rail====\n\n[[File:07 21 09 006xRP - Flickr - drewj1946.jpg|thumb|A [[South Shore Line|South Shore]] commuter train in [[Michigan City, Indiana|Michigan City]]]]\n\nIndiana has more than 4,255 railroad route miles, of which 91 percent are operated by Class I railroads, principally [[CSX Transportation]] and the [[Norfolk Southern Railway]].

In 1843 the Legislature ruled that African Americans could not attend the public schools, leading to the foundation of [[Union Literary Institute]] and other schools for them, funded by donations or the students themselves.\n\nAlthough the growth of the public school system was held up by legal entanglements, many public elementary schools were in use by 1870. Most children in Indiana attend public schools, but nearly 10% attend private schools and [[parochial school]]s. About one-half of all college students in Indiana are enrolled in state-supported four-year schools.\n\nIndiana public schools have gone through several changes throughout Indiana's history. Modern, public school standards, have been implemented all throughout the state. These new standards were adopted in April 2014. The overall goal of these new state standards is to ensure Indiana students have the necessary skills and requirements needed to enter college or the workforce upon high school graduation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Indiana Academic Standards |url=https://www.doe.in.gov/standards |website=Indiana Department of Education |publisher=Indiana Department of Education |accessdate=November 4, 2018}}</ref> State standards can be found for nearly every major subject taught in Indiana public schools. Mathematics, English/Language Arts, Science, and Social Studies are among the top, prioritized standards. In 2017, the Indiana Department of Education reported that the state's overall graduation rates were 87.19% for waivered graduations and 80.10% for non-waiver graduations.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Baker |first1=Adam |title=Indiana Department of Education Releases 2017 Graduation Rates |url=https://www.doe.in.gov/news/indiana-department-education-releases-2017-graduation-rates |website=Indiana Department of Education |publisher=Indiana Department of Education |accessdate=November 4, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe largest educational institution is [[Indiana University]], the [[Indiana University Bloomington|flagship campus]] of which was endorsed as Indiana Seminary in 1820.

name=seds-issschedule/> The mission is contracted by [[NASA]] and will be flown by [[SpaceX]] using a [[Dragon 2|Cargo Dragon]]. This will be the first flight for SpaceX under NASA's [[Commercial Resupply Services#Commercial Resupply Services phase 2|CRS-2]] contract awarded in January 2016.\n\n==Cargo Dragon==\nSpaceX plans to reuse the Cargo Dragons up to five (5) times. The Crew Dragon capsules used on missions with astronauts, are not planned to be reused (initially). The Cargo Dragon will launch without SuperDraco abort engines, without seats, cockpit controls and the life support system required to sustain astronauts in space.<ref name=teslarati-20200217/> This newer design provides several benefits, including a faster process to recover, refurbish and re-fly versus the earlier Dragon CRS design used for ISS cargo missions.<ref name=sfn20190802/>\n\nBeginning with the CRS-21 mission, the new Dragon Cargo capsules will splash down under parachutes in the Atlantic Ocean east of Florida, rather than the current recovery zone in the Pacific Ocean west of Baja California. This was a NASA preference, added to CRS-2.<ref name=sfn20190802/><ref name=nasa-oif-18016/>\n\n==Primary payload==\nNASA contracted for the CRS-21 mission from SpaceX and therefore determines the primary payload, date of launch, and [[orbital elements|orbital parameters]] for the [[SpaceX Dragon|Cargo Dragon]].<ref name=NASA-SpX21-Overview/>\n\n* '''Science investigations:'''   {{cvt|0|lb|order=flip}}\n* '''Vehicle hardware:'''         {{cvt|0|lb|order=flip}}\n* '''Crew supplies:'''            {{cvt|0|lb|order=flip}}\n* '''Spacewalk equipment:'''      {{cvt|0|lb|order=flip}}\n* '''Computer resources:'''       {{cvt|0|lb|order=flip}}\n* '''External payloads:''' BISHOP {{cvt|0|lb|order=flip}}\n\n''' Bishop''' formerly known as NanoRacks Airlock Module, is a small commercial airlock module attached to Node 3 ([[Tranquility (ISS module)|Tranquility module]]) of the ISS.<ref name=Bishop2020/> The NanoRacks Airlock Module will offer five times the satellite deployment volume than current opportunities (Japanese [[Kibo (ISS module)|Kibo module]] airlock) available today.

It is housed in the building used for the \u201cPavilion of Promise\u201d at [[Expo 88|World Expo 88]], and the [[South Brisbane Dry Dock]] which was built in the 1870s and was {{convert|313|ft|m|0}} long and {{convert|60|ft|m|0}} wide. In 1887 the dock was extended to {{convert|430|ft|m|0}} due to the increasing size of vessels.<ref name=\"qmma\" />\n\nThe museum also includes a library that stocks documents, pictures and other relevant artifacts relating to maritime history. There are several maps that show how early navigators created accurate charts. \n\nInformation is also provided about some of the 1,500 plus shipwrecks that have occurred along the Queensland coast including the [[Great Barrier Reef]].\n\n== Vessels ==\n\nThe {{convert|121|ft|m|0}}<ref>[http://www.maritimemuseum.com.au/Collections/forceful.htm ''Forceful'' specs]</ref> [[Forceful (tugboat)|steam tug ''Forceful'']], the only remaining working coal-fired steam tug in [[Queensland]], is berthed at the Museum wharf and there are regular sailings down the Brisbane River. It was built in 1925 by Alex Stephen & Son Ltd., [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]]. In 1941 it was chartered by the government for service in the Middle East, but did not sail because [[Japan]] entered [[World War II]]. She was then requisitioned by the [[Royal Australian Navy]] and became known as HMAS ''Forceful''.
