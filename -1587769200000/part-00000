It was intended to connect the thinly populated west of the island, and it opened in 1889. At Newport it relied on the existing [[Isle of Wight Central Railway]]'s [[Newport railway station (Isle of Wight Central Railway)|station]], but trains entering it had to shunt back from the junction. The IoWCR worked the line.\n\nThe line was never commercially successful, and a break with the IoWCR in 1913 obliged the FY&NR hastily to build its own [[Newport railway station (Freshwater, Yarmouth and Newport Railway)|Newport station]] and acquire locomotives and rolling stock while in receivership.\n\nAfter the [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]] absorbed the FY&NR in 1923, the SR developed holiday traffic, but it was highly seasonal and the heavy losses resulted in the line's closure in 1953.\n\n==Concept and construction==\n[[File:FY&NR.png|thumb|System map of the Freshwater, Yarmouth and Newport Railway]]\nBy 1880 the Isle of Wight was well supplied with railways in its eastern and northern areas, connecting [[Ryde]] with [[Newport, Isle of Wight|Newport]] and [[Cowes]], and Ryde and Newport with [[Sandown]] and [[Ventnor]]. The more beautiful, but more thinly-populated west was untouched. Newport was the industrial centre on the island, and its geographical position on the [[River Medina]] made it a natural connection point. The Cowes and Newport Railway had a junction station there.\n\nIn 1868 a Bouldnor, Yarmouth and Freshwater Railway was proposed, but it did not proceed.<ref name = blackburn>Alan Blackburn and John Mackett, ''Freshwater, Yarmouth and Newport Railway'', Forge Books, Bracknell, second edition 1988, {{ISBN|0 904662 17 9}}</ref> In 1872 a Freshwater, Bouldnor and Newport Railway was promoted; [[Bouldnor]] is a hamlet a mile or so east of Yarmouth; this venture was unsuccessful.<ref name = robbins>Michael Robbins, ''The Isle of wight (Newport Junction) Railway'', in the Railway Magazine, October 1959</ref>\n\nA parliamentary bill was submitted for a line connecting [[Freshwater, Isle of Wight|Freshwater]] and Newport, and this received [[royal assent]] on 26 August 1880,<ref name = bennett>{{cite book |last=Bennett |first=A. |title=Southern Holiday Lines in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight |location=Cheltenham |publisher=Runpast |year=1994 |isbn=1-870754-31-X }}</ref><ref name = maycock>{{cite book |last1=Maycock |first1=R.J. |last2=Silsbury |first2=R. |title=The Freshwater, Yarmouth and Newport Railway |location=Usk |publisher=Oakwood |year=2003 |isbn=0-85361-601-9 }}</ref> authorising the ''Freshwater, Yarmouth and Isle of Wight Railway''.

The line was constructed with passing loops at [[Carisbrooke]], [[Ningwood]] and Yarmouth. The line was opened for goods traffic on 10 September 1888 and for passengers on 20 July 1889.\n\n==Opening==\nAn inaugural train was run on 10 August 1888 hauled by an [[0-6-0]] tank engine that had been used by the contractor constructing the line, and named ''Freshwater'' for the occasion. For this demonstration run the locomotive pulled a single mineral wagon fitted with seats.

The junction with the Cowes and Newport line was on the Cowes side of Newport station, and faced Cowes, so that the FY&NR trains running to Newport had to [[Run-round loop|run round]] at the point of junction and run back to the station. (The Board had been required to give a formal undertaking that propelling without running round would not be carried out.<ref name = blackburn/> After many years a dispensation was procured from the [[Board of Trade]] permitting propelling for the short distance between the junction and the station.)\n\n==End of the working agreement==\n[[File:Yarmouth (IOW) Railway Station.jpg|thumb|Yarmouth station in 2008]]\nFrom the outset the working agreement between the FY&NR and the IoWCR was contentious, due to the supposed inadequacy of structures and earthworks, for which the IoWCR was unwilling to accept the liability. The IoWCR may have suggested that a third-party contractor take that responsibility, for the FY&NR wrote to the IoWCR stating that \"the principle of our line being maintained by any other person than the working company is not feasible. We find that there is no such case in the whole railway systems of Great Britain.\"<ref name = liability>Letter from FY&NR to IoWCR prior to July 1889, partly quoted in Blackburn, page 11</ref>\n\nWhether the FY&NR did the maintenance by direct labour or by contract, it was inadequate from the outset. There were also several disputes about charges for the use of stations. A further review of the working agreement in 1896 resulted in a 14-year arrangement, by which the IoWCR got 45% of traffic receipts.<ref name = blackburn/>\n\nIn 1910 that agreement expired, and the IoWCR was once more concerned that renewal of the working agreement committed them to steeply rising expenditure due to life expiry of much of the original FY&NR equipment, and discussions took place over the future working charge. In 1911 an 18-month agreement was settled, in which the IoWCR took 75% of receipts, their obligation including most infrastructure maintenance. The FY&NR agreed but was unhappy, and sought advice from [[Sam Fay]] of the [[Great Central Railway]], who had a residence on the island. Fay recommended that the FY&NR should work its own line, and the FY&NR decided to proceed on that basis, procuring some passenger coaches from the [[Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway]], then starting electric passenger services with new stock. The FY&NR gave notice that they would work their line from 1 July 1913, and that they would not use the IoWCR station at Newport (to avoid the toll for its use).\n\nThe FY&NR provided its own station, a short distance before the point of junction at Newport. Goods sidings too had to be provided there. White refers to the station as being \"a small corrugated iron one\" but he meant the booking office; the platform and the accommodation generally was remarkably extensive.<ref name = white>H P White, ''A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 2: Southern England'', Phoenix House Limited, London, 1961</ref> The IoWCR had acquired additional passenger coaches under the 1911 agreement, and the FY&NR were obliged under that agreement to buy them on. They had to issue debenture stock to pay for them.<ref name = blackburn/><ref name = mitchell/>\n\nBlackburn and Mackett state:\n<blockquote>Some accounts of the events leading to the break between the two companies imply that it was the IWCR who took the initiative by banning the Freshwater Company's trains from Newport station, and even that they forced the FYN to run its own services by refusing to work the line. No evidence could be found to support these views. On the contrary it appears that the FYN were entirely responsible for the break. Naturally there was some opposition from the Central, and Harry Willmott, who owned some FYN stock, tried to organise some of the other shareholders to veto the proposal to build another station at Newport, but was unable to get sufficient votes. It also appears that after the break the IWCR did all they could to facilitate the exchange of passengers, luggage and parcels between the two stations.<ref name = blackburn16>Blackburn and Mackett, page 16</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe engine power the FY&NR procured now consisted of two locomotives only, indicating the limited volume of traffic it was running. They were second-hand 0-6-0 tank engines, dating from 1902 and 1876. The 1902 locomotive, no. 1, was the youngest to work on the Island and one of only two built in the twentieth century.<ref name = mitchell>Vic Mitchell and Keith Smith, ''Branch Lines to Newport'', Middleton Press, Midhurst, 1985, {{ISBN|0 906 520 26 6}}</ref> No. 2 was only fitted with the vacuum brake and consequently could only work one set of coaches, which were similarly fitted.

This resulted in complaints to the Railway and Canal Commissioners, who put pressure on the companies to ameliorate the situation, and from 1914 most FY&NR passenger trains resumed using the IoWCR station, although running beyond that point remained discontinued.\n\n==A Solent tunnel==\n[[File:Watchingwellhalt old station.jpg|thumb|The former Watchingwell station building]]\nIn 1900 a proposal was put forward to construct a tunnel under the [[Solent]] connecting the FY&NR with the mainland network at [[Lymington]]. The idea got as far as an authorising Act of Parliament of 1901, incorporating the South Western & Isle of Wight Junction Railway. Nothing came of the scheme, but it was revived in 1913 as a means of reviving the finances of the FY&NR. However raising the capital for the works was problematical, and the onset of [[World War I]] put paid to the idea.<ref name = jones/>\n\nIt was suggested again after 1923, but at the time the [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]] had invested heavily in piers and ferryboats, and were opposed to the idea; the local authorities too considered it unacceptably expensive.<ref name = dendy/> In fact in 1932 Dendy Marshall wrote to ''The Engineer'' magazine, proposing a tunnel with a revival of the atmospheric system. In a {{convert|3|mi|spell=in|adj=on|0}} smooth-walled tunnel; there would be trains of \"one carriage fitted with about half a dozen transverse fins of [[india-rubber]] nearly fitting the tunnel\". Powerful fans would propel the vehicle at up to {{cvt|60|mph}}.<ref name = atmos>Letter from Dendy Marshall partly quoted in Blackburn, page 13</ref>\n\n==Grouping of the railways==\nAfter [[World War I]] the Government considered the future of the railways of Great Britain, and passed the [[Railways Act 1921]]. In a process referred to as the \"grouping\", this set up four new railway companies which were to take over nearly all the existing companies. The [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)|Southern Railway]] absorbed all lines on the Isle of Wight from 1 January 1923, except for the FY&NR. The compensation to shareholders was to be negotiated, and although the FY&NR was in receivership, it argued that its prospects were good because of the hoped-for Lymington tunnel connection, and it attempted to obtain a better financial settlement. The negotiation dragged on and it was not until 1 August 1923 that the transfer took place. During the hiatus period, the FY&NR trains had to revert to using the separate station at Newport, with renewed inconvenience to passengers.<ref name = jones/>\n\nThe Southern Railway brought new vigour to the railways of the island, and a new Tourist Express was laid on in the summer months, with limited stops, linking Freshwater with [[Sandown]]. This started as the ''East and West Through Train'', a name shown on carriage roofboards in 1932, and it proved a considerable success. In the following year further trains of this type were run, and the previous year's East and West Through Train was extended from Sandown to Ventnor, and named ''The Tourist'' in the public timetable. A through fast train from [[Ryde]] to Freshwater was also introduced, the first such for twenty years.<ref name = allen/> The crossing loop at Ningwood was lengthened to {{convert|400|ft}} in 1936 to accommodate these services, while the loops at Carisbrooke and Yarmouth were removed.<ref name = mitchell/>\n\nIn the summer of 1939 there were thirteen trains in each direction with extra trains on Saturdays, and eight each way on Sundays. The journey time was about 37 minutes.<ref name = jones/>\n\n==The final years==\nThe traffic on the line had always been highly seasonal, and the thin population in its area meant that the financial situation was precarious. Road transport of passengers and goods became increasingly dominant from the 1930s and further accelerated after [[World War II]], and the losses on the line were unsustainable in the face of the low volume of custom. The line closed on 21 September 1953.<ref name=\"Paye\">{{cite book |last=Paye |first=Peter |title=Isle of Wight Railways remembered |location=Oxford |publisher=OPC |year=1990 |isbn=0-86093-212-5 |ref=harv }}</ref> The locomotive used on the final journey was ''Alverstone'', built in 1891 and brought to the Island in 1926.\n\n===Stations===\n\nThe line opened on 20 July 1889 and closed on 21 September 1953.\n\n* [[Freshwater (Isle of Wight) railway station|Freshwater]];\n* [[Yarmouth (Isle of Wight) railway station|Yarmouth]];\n* [[Ningwood railway station|Ningwood]];\n* [[Calbourne & Shalfleet railway station|Calbourne & Shalfleet]];\n* [[Watchingwell Halt railway station|Watchingwell]]; opened 20 July 1889 as a private station for Sir John Stephen Barrington Simeon; publicly advertised in 1923 and 1924;\n* [[Carisbrooke railway station|Carisbrooke]];\n* [[Newport railway station (Freshwater, Yarmouth and Newport Railway)|Newport (FY&NR station)]]; opened 14 July 1913; closed 1 August 1923; intermittent use from 1914;\n* [[Newport railway station (Isle of Wight Central Railway)|Newport]]; Isle of Wight Central Railway (former Cowes and Newport Railway) station.<ref name = mitchell/><ref name = quick>M E Quick, ''Railway Passenger Stations in England Scotland and Wales\u2014A Chronology'', The Railway and Canal Historical Society, 2002</ref>\n\n===Gradients===\nThe first {{convert|3|mi|0|adj=on}} section of the line from Freshwater followed easy gradients, but then a climb of 1 in 64 followed for a mile, and that was the ruling gradient for {{convert|6|mi|0}} of largely [[wikt:switchback|switchback]] (sawtooth) profile to beyond Watchingwell.

The idea got as far as an authorising Act of Parliament of 1901, incorporating the South Western & Isle of Wight Junction Railway. Nothing came of the scheme, but it was revived in 1913 as a means of reviving the finances of the FY&NR. However raising the capital for the works was problematical, and the onset of [[World War I]] put paid to the idea.<ref name = jones/>\n\nIt was suggested again after 1923, but at the time the [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]] had invested heavily in piers and ferryboats, and were opposed to the idea; the local authorities too considered it unacceptably expensive.<ref name = dendy/> In fact in 1932 Dendy Marshall wrote to ''The Engineer'' magazine, proposing a tunnel with a revival of the atmospheric system. In a {{convert|3|mi|spell=in|adj=on|0}} smooth-walled tunnel; there would be trains of \"one carriage fitted with about half a dozen transverse fins of [[india-rubber]] nearly fitting the tunnel\". Powerful fans would propel the vehicle at up to {{cvt|60|mph}}.<ref name = atmos>Letter from Dendy Marshall partly quoted in Blackburn, page 13</ref>\n\n==Grouping of the railways==\nAfter [[World War I]] the Government considered the future of the railways of Great Britain, and passed the [[Railways Act 1921]]. In a process referred to as the \"grouping\", this set up four new railway companies which were to take over nearly all the existing companies. The [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)|Southern Railway]] absorbed all lines on the Isle of Wight from 1 January 1923, except for the FY&NR. The compensation to shareholders was to be negotiated, and although the FY&NR was in receivership, it argued that its prospects were good because of the hoped-for Lymington tunnel connection, and it attempted to obtain a better financial settlement. The negotiation dragged on and it was not until 1 August 1923 that the transfer took place. During the hiatus period, the FY&NR trains had to revert to using the separate station at Newport, with renewed inconvenience to passengers.<ref name = jones/>\n\nThe Southern Railway brought new vigour to the railways of the island, and a new Tourist Express was laid on in the summer months, with limited stops, linking Freshwater with [[Sandown]]. This started as the ''East and West Through Train'', a name shown on carriage roofboards in 1932, and it proved a considerable success. In the following year further trains of this type were run, and the previous year's East and West Through Train was extended from Sandown to Ventnor, and named ''The Tourist'' in the public timetable. A through fast train from [[Ryde]] to Freshwater was also introduced, the first such for twenty years.<ref name = allen/> The crossing loop at Ningwood was lengthened to {{convert|400|ft}} in 1936 to accommodate these services, while the loops at Carisbrooke and Yarmouth were removed.<ref name = mitchell/>\n\nIn the summer of 1939 there were thirteen trains in each direction with extra trains on Saturdays, and eight each way on Sundays. The journey time was about 37 minutes.<ref name = jones/>\n\n==The final years==\nThe traffic on the line had always been highly seasonal, and the thin population in its area meant that the financial situation was precarious. Road transport of passengers and goods became increasingly dominant from the 1930s and further accelerated after [[World War II]], and the losses on the line were unsustainable in the face of the low volume of custom. The line closed on 21 September 1953.<ref name=\"Paye\">{{cite book |last=Paye |first=Peter |title=Isle of Wight Railways remembered |location=Oxford |publisher=OPC |year=1990 |isbn=0-86093-212-5 |ref=harv }}</ref> The locomotive used on the final journey was ''Alverstone'', built in 1891 and brought to the Island in 1926.\n\n==Topography==\n{| {{Railway line header}}\n{{BS-header|Freshwater, Yarmouth and Newport Railway}}\n{{BS-table}}\n{{BS4|exKBHFa|||||[[Freshwater (Isle of Wight) railway station|Freshwater]]}}\n{{BS4|exBHF|O1=HUBaq|BOOT|O2=HUBeq||||[[Yarmouth (Isle of Wight) railway station|Yarmouth]]|''[[London and South Western Railway|L&SWR]] ferry to {{rws|Lymington Pier||Lymington}}''}}\n{{BS4|exHST|||||[[Ningwood (Isle of Wight) railway station|Ningwood]]}}\n{{BS4|exHST|||||[[Calbourne & Shalfleet railway station|Calbourne and Shalfleet]]}}\n{{BS4|expHST|||||[[Watchingwell Halt (Isle of Wight) railway station|Watchingwell]]}}\n{{BS4|exHST|||||[[Carisbrooke railway station|Carisbrooke]]}}\n{{BS4|exSTR|exCONTg|||||''[[Isle of Wight Central Railway|IoWCR]] to {{rws|Cowes}}''}}\n{{BS4|exSTR|exSTR|O2=POINTERg@fq|||||''FY&NR trains reverse''}}\n{{BS4|exHST|exSTR||||[[Newport railway station (FY&NR Isle of Wight)|Newport (FY&NR)]]}}\n{{BS4|exSTRl|exABZgr||}}\n{{BS4||exBHF||||[[Newport railway station (IoWCR Isle of Wight)|Newport (IoWCR)]]}}\n{{BS4||exSTR|WASSER|exCONTg|||''[[Isle of Wight Central Railway|IoWCR]] to {{rws|Ryde St John's Road||Ryde}}''}}\n{{BS4||exSTRl|exhKRZWaeq|exABZr+r|||''[[River Medina]]''}}\n{{BS4|||WASSER|exCONTf|||''[[Isle of Wight Central Railway|IoWCR]] to {{rws|Sandown}}''}}\n|}\n|}\n\n===Stations===\n\nThe line opened on 20 July 1889 and closed on 21 September 1953.\n\n* [[Freshwater (Isle of Wight) railway station|Freshwater]];\n* [[Yarmouth (Isle of Wight) railway station|Yarmouth]];\n* [[Ningwood railway station|Ningwood]];\n* [[Calbourne & Shalfleet railway station|Calbourne & Shalfleet]];\n* [[Watchingwell Halt railway station|Watchingwell]]; opened 20 July 1889 as a private station for Sir John Stephen Barrington Simeon; publicly advertised in 1923 and 1924;\n* [[Carisbrooke railway station|Carisbrooke]];\n* [[Newport railway station (Freshwater, Yarmouth and Newport Railway)|Newport (FY&NR station)]]; opened 14 July 1913; closed 1 August 1923; intermittent use from 1914;\n* [[Newport railway station (Isle of Wight Central Railway)|Newport]]; Isle of Wight Central Railway (former Cowes and Newport Railway) station.<ref name = mitchell/><ref name = quick>M E Quick, ''Railway Passenger Stations in England Scotland and Wales\u2014A Chronology'', The Railway and Canal Historical Society, 2002</ref>\n\n===Gradients===\nThe first {{convert|3|mi|0|adj=on}} section of the line from Freshwater followed easy gradients, but then a climb of 1 in 64 followed for a mile, and that was the ruling gradient for {{convert|6|mi|0}} of largely [[wikt:switchback|switchback]] (sawtooth) profile to beyond Watchingwell.

Centuries later the [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]] lived there, eventually being expelled after the U.S. Government gave land grants to Revolutionary War soldiers in lieu of pay. Property originally bestowed in this area to Elijah Backus, [[Jonathan Dayton]] and Andrew Marker was sold as farm property to a number of different families in the 1800s.\n\nBrothers and real estate developers King and Ben Thompson founded Upper Arlington. They purchased the original 840 acres of land, south of present-day Lane Avenue, from James T. Miller in 1913. It was directly adjacent to the [[Marble Cliff Quarry Co.]] They first referred to the area as the \"Country Club District\" modeled after the Country Club development in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], but by 1917 the community had become known as \"Upper Arlington\" in reference to its southern neighbor of Arlington (now known as [[Marble Cliff]]). The Upper Arlington Company was incorporated that year and by 1920 operated out of a field office built in Miller Park; that building also served as a street-car shelter house and is presently the Miller Park branch of the Upper Arlington Library.\n\nThe development proceeded according to the [[Garden city movement|Garden City]]\u2013inspired plan by [[Landscape architecture|landscape architect]] William Pitkin, Jr., which called for following the contours of the land to form curving streets copiously lined with trees rather than a gridded street layout. This design style gave the oldest district in Upper Arlington (at its southernmost end) its distinctively pleasant, park-like feel, featuring numerous small green spaces.\n\nIn 1916, the development was interrupted when the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] used the area as a temporary training camp called Camp Willis after Ohio's [[Governor of Ohio|governor]] at the time, [[Frank B. Willis]]. Thousands of servicemen were trained at Camp Willis and then dispatched against [[Pancho Villa]] on the [[Mexico|Mexican]] border. The camp was dismantled by September 1916. Development resumed shortly afterwards, and on March 20, 1918, Upper Arlington incorporated as a village with a population of 200. James T. Miller, the original landowner, served as the first mayor. The Mallway business district, which was constructed in the 1920s, was the first commercial district in Upper Arlington.\n\nMany restrictions existed as Upper Arlington developed. Some of these involved creating open, green spaces, maintenance of parks, generous setbacks ensuring large front and corner lawns, and carefully controlled development of separate areas for businesses and multi-family housing. From 1920 to 1945, the city enforced racially restrictive covenants in property deeds. From 1930 to 1945, 77.3% of the 22 new subdivisions built in the Columbus, Ohio area either explicitly prohibited African Americans or permitted only whites.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Krueckeberg|first=Donald A.|date=January 1996|title=Reviews : Planning for the Private Interest: Land Use Controls and Residential Patterns in Columbus, Ohio, 1900-1970.

Most annexation occurred in the late 1940s through 1960. The two largest annexations occurred in 1954 and 1955, by which the city nearly doubled its surface area. Henderson Road has been Upper Arlington's northern border since 1969.\n\nThe annexed property was part of Perry Township, which had been home to numerous farm residents and their families in the 1800s. One such resident was Pleasant Litchford, a former slave who migrated north after buying his freedom, and who became a notable citizen in the African-American community. The current high school sits on property owned by Pleasant Litchford until his death in 1879. The property was annexed into Upper Arlington in the 1950s.\n\nOther Perry Township farming family names from the 1800s include Kennedy, Kenny, Legg, and Trapp. The McCoy, Richards, Lakin, Matthews, Delashmutt, Phenegar, Slyh, Zollinger, Bickett, Wills and Walcutt families were connected in some way by marriage and have descendants living in Upper Arlington. Richards and McCoy family reunions were held for decades; their first was in 1895, with 109 in attendance.\n[[File:Founding Families.jpg|left|thumb|Richards & McCoy Reunion]]\n\nThe post\u2013[[World War II]] housing boom led to the development of many new housing tracts north of Lane Avenue. The newer developments took on a much different character from the older core of the city, being mostly organized along normal street grids and with classic [[ranch-style house]]s like those found in the area called River Ridge. By the 1960s, as the city grew north, the houses were larger and the neighborhoods more consistent with the intent, if not style, of the original section south of Lane Avenue. The southern half of the city, designated as the \"Upper Arlington Historic District\" (or colloquially \"Old Arlington\" or \"South of Lane\"), was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1985.\n\n==Geography==\nUpper Arlington is bordered on the west by the [[Scioto River]], on the north and east by Columbus, and on the south by [[Marble Cliff, Ohio|Marble Cliff]] and [[Grandview Heights, Ohio|Grandview Heights]]. The [[Olentangy River]] and the main campus of the [[Ohio State University]] are a short distance to the east of Upper Arlington. Downtown Columbus lies to the southeast, its skyline visible across the OSU farmland research facilities extending along Upper Arlington's eastern border.\n\nThe city is around 800&nbsp;ft elevation located between the Olentangy and Scioto rivers. Two ravines cut through the city. The Slate Run in the northwest corner flows into the [[Scioto River]]. However, the Turkey Run is longer. It originates in the north then runs southwards until it makes an eastward bend around Reed Rd. Then, it flows eastwards through the OSU Golf Course. The run is used as a storm drain at points, has been dammed in the Ohio State course and runs through concrete pipes at two points. The soil is [[Till|glacial till]] and is suitable for agriculture, supporting a research farm operated by [[The Ohio State University]].\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|9.87|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|9.84|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.03|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061959/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|archive-date=2012-01-25|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1920= 620\n|1930= 3059\n|1940= 5370\n|1950= 9024\n|1960= 28486\n|1970= 38727\n|1980= 35648\n|1990= 34128\n|2000= 33686\n|2010= 33771\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=35522\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 30, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref><ref name=Census1930>{{cite web|title=Population: Ohio|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/03815512v1ch08.pdf|work=1930 US Census|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=28 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Census1960\">{{cite web|title=Number of Inhabitants: Ohio|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/37749197v1p37_ch02.pdf|work=18th Census of the United States|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=\"Census1990\">{{cite web|title=Ohio: Population and Housing Unit Counts|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen1990/cph2/cph-2-37.pdf|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"CensusPopEst\">{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=25 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archive-date=11 June 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the 2010 census, the population was 33,771 persons, 16,157 male (47.84%) and 17,614 female (52.16%).

As of 2000, the Upper Arlington Board of Education was the city's largest employer. The district provides an early education school, five elementary schools, two middle schools, and a high school. Burbank Early Education School serves students before the elementary level and was created during a period when the population demanded fewer elementary buildings. The district offers an optional [[Alternative education|informal/progressive style of education]] through Wickliffe Elementary and Barrington Elementary in addition to conventional program. Other elementary schools include Greensview, Tremont and Windermere.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uaschools.org/|title=Upper Arlington City Schools|website=www.uaschools.org|access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref>\n\nHastings Middle School was built in the 1960s and serves the northern area of the district.

The City Council is elected by citizens and then hires a professional City Manager to run day-to-day operations and implement policy passed by Council.\n\nUpper Arlington's Community Development Department coordinates the many aspects involved in the City's growth, development and preservation Building, Planning and Property Maintenance divisions, with development projects guided and served by an award-winning, streamlined review and zoning process. An Economic Development Division provides a range of services to help existing, new and expanding businesses grow and be successful in the community while diversifying and expanding the range of businesses, and amenities available to residents and strengthening the tax base. The Engineering Division manages the City's public infrastructure\u2014such as roads, waterlines, sanitary and storm sewer systems, and public right-of-way\u2014with a 10-year Capital Improvement Program in place to ensure proactive reinvestment in these critical community assets. The Public Works Division focuses on vital services that keep motorists traveling safely within our community throughout the seasons, including minor road repairs, street cleaning, snow removal and leaf collection.\n\nThe City is always looking for innovative ways to bring the best care and public safety to the community. This is done through a variety of services including: CARES, Bike Helmets for Kids, Blood Pressure Checks, CPR Training, and Safe Baby Training. Upper Arlington's Fire Division also staffs all medic trucks with at least two paramedics and all fire apparatus with at least one paramedic at all times. The Police Division provides 24-hour service and is an integral part of developing and maintaining a safe and secure community.\n\nThe Parks & Recreation Department fulfills the recreational, cultural and educational needs of the community through an exciting array of programs and activities, as well as maintaining the City's beautiful parks, street trees and other public spaces.

Prior to 1967, the libraries in Upper Arlington were branches of the Grandview Heights Public Library. After circulation at the Upper Arlington branches surpassed their parent library, Mayor John Dunkel spearheaded an effort to challenge a law prohibiting new library systems in Ohio.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ualibrary.org/|title=Upper Arlington Public Library|website=Upper Arlington Public Library|language=en|access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref> Thanks to his perseverance, the Ohio General Assembly passed Ohio House Bill No. 494 in 1967, allowing Upper Arlington to independently establish and govern its own library system. Celebrating its 50th anniversary in 2017, the Upper Arlington Library System is considered a community jewel, providing opportunities for lifelong learning and fellowship.\n\n==Sister city==\nThe city is sister cities with [[St. Andrews]], [[Scotland]].\n\n==Notable people==\n*[[John W.

Centuries later the [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]] lived there, eventually being expelled after the U.S. Government gave land grants to Revolutionary War soldiers in lieu of pay. Property originally bestowed in this area to Elijah Backus, [[Jonathan Dayton]] and Andrew Marker was sold as farm property to a number of different families in the 1800s.\n\nBrothers and real estate developers King and Ben Thompson founded Upper Arlington. They purchased the original 840 acres of land, south of present-day Lane Avenue, from James T. Miller in 1913. It was directly adjacent to the [[Marble Cliff Quarry Co.]] They first referred to the area as the \"Country Club District\" modeled after the Country Club development in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], but by 1917 the community became known as \"Upper Arlington\" in reference to its southern neighbor of Arlington (now known as [[Marble Cliff]]). The Upper Arlington Company was incorporated that year and by 1920 operated out of a field office built in Miller Park; that building also served as a street-car shelter house and is presently the Miller Park branch of the Upper Arlington Library.\n\nThe development proceeded according to the [[Garden city movement|Garden City]]\u2013inspired plan by [[Landscape architecture|landscape architect]] William Pitkin, Jr., which called for following the contours of the land to form curving streets copiously lined with trees rather than a gridded street layout. This design style gave the oldest district in Upper Arlington (at its southernmost end) its distinctively pleasant, park-like feel, featuring numerous small green spaces.\n\nIn 1916, the development was interrupted when the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] used the area as a temporary training camp called Camp Willis after Ohio's [[Governor of Ohio|governor]] at the time, [[Frank B. Willis]]. Thousands of servicemen were trained at Camp Willis and then dispatched against [[Pancho Villa]] on the [[Mexico|Mexican]] border. The camp was dismantled by September 1916. Development resumed shortly afterwards, and on March 20, 1918, Upper Arlington incorporated as a village with a population of 200. James T. Miller, the original landowner, served as the first mayor. The Mallway business district, which was constructed in the 1920s, was the first commercial district in Upper Arlington.\n\nMany restrictions existed as Upper Arlington developed. Some of these involved creating open, green spaces, maintenance of parks, generous setbacks ensuring large front and corner lawns, and carefully controlled development of separate areas for businesses and multi-family housing. From 1920 to 1945, the city enforced racially restrictive covenants in property deeds. From 1930 to 1945, 77.3% of the 22 new subdivisions built in the Columbus, Ohio area either explicitly prohibited African Americans or permitted only whites.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Krueckeberg|first=Donald A.|date=January 1996|title=Reviews : Planning for the Private Interest: Land Use Controls and Residential Patterns in Columbus, Ohio, 1900-1970.

Most annexation occurred in the late 1940s through 1960. The two largest annexations occurred in 1954 and 1955, by which the city nearly doubled its surface area. Henderson Road has been Upper Arlington's northern border since 1969.\n\nThe annexed property was part of Perry Township, which had been home to numerous farm residents and their families in the 1800s. One such resident was Pleasant Litchford, a former slave who migrated north after buying his freedom, and who became a notable citizen in the African-American community. The current high school sits on property owned by Pleasant Litchford until his death in 1879. The property was annexed into Upper Arlington in the 1950s.\n\nOther Perry Township farming family names from the 1800s include Kennedy, Kenny, Legg, and Trapp. The McCoy, Richards, Lakin, Matthews, Delashmutt, Phenegar, Slyh, Zollinger, Bickett, Wills and Walcutt families were connected in some way by marriage and have descendants living in Upper Arlington. Richards and McCoy family reunions were held for decades; their first was in 1895, with 109 in attendance.\n[[File:Founding Families.jpg|left|thumb|Richards & McCoy Reunion]]\n\nThe post\u2013[[World War II]] housing boom led to the development of many new housing tracts north of Lane Avenue. The newer developments took on a much different character from the older core of the city, being mostly organized along normal street grids and with classic [[ranch-style house]]s like those found in the area called River Ridge. By the 1960s, as the city grew north, the houses were larger and the neighborhoods more consistent with the intent, if not style, of the original section south of Lane Avenue. The southern half of the city, designated as the \"Upper Arlington Historic District\" (or colloquially \"Old Arlington\" or \"South of Lane\"), was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1985.\n\n==Geography==\nUpper Arlington is bordered on the west by the [[Scioto River]], on the north and east by Columbus, and on the south by [[Marble Cliff, Ohio|Marble Cliff]] and [[Grandview Heights, Ohio|Grandview Heights]]. The [[Olentangy River]] and the main campus of the [[Ohio State University]] are a short distance to the east of Upper Arlington. Downtown Columbus lies to the southeast, its skyline visible across the OSU farmland research facilities extending along Upper Arlington's eastern border.\n\nThe city is around 800&nbsp;ft elevation located between the Olentangy and Scioto rivers. Two ravines cut through the city. The Slate Run in the northwest corner flows into the [[Scioto River]]. However, the Turkey Run is longer.
