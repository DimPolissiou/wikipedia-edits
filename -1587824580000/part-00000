A preliminary version of the character also appears in the novel ''[[Go Set a Watchman]]'', written in the mid-1950s but not published until 2015. Atticus is a lawyer and resident of the fictional Maycomb County, Alabama, and the father of Jeremy \"Jem\" Finch and Jean Louise \"Scout\" Finch. Lee based the character on her own father, [[Amasa Coleman Lee]], an Alabama lawyer, who, like Atticus, represented black defendants in a highly publicized criminal trial.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=''Who was Atticus Finch?'' |work=Texas Bar Journal |volume=73 |issue=6 |first1=Talmage |last1=Boston |date=June 2010 |pages=484\u2013485 |url=http://www.texasbar.com/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Texas_Bar_Journal&Template=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&ContentID=9585 |format=PDF |access-date=2013-02-05}}</ref> ''[[Book (magazine)|Book]]'' magazine's list of ''The 100 Best Characters in Fiction Since 1900'' names Finch as the seventh best fictional character of 20th-century literature.<ref name=infoplease>{{Cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipea/A0932846.html |title=''Book Magazine's'' The 100 Best Characters in Fiction Since 1900 |publisher=InfoPlease.com |access-date=2010-05-21}}</ref><ref name=NPR>{{Cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/programs/totn/features/2002/mar/020319.chohdsfsdhfaracters.html |title=100 Best Characters in Fiction Since 1900 |author=''Book'' Magazine, March/April 2002 |date=March 2002 |work=Talk of the Nation |publisher=[[NPR]] |access-date=November 17, 2011}}{{Dead link|date=May 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> In 2003, the [[American Film Institute]] voted Atticus Finch, as portrayed in an [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Academy Award]]-winning performance by [[Gregory Peck]] in the [[To Kill a Mockingbird (film)|1962 film adaptation]], as the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes & Villains|greatest hero of all American cinema]].<ref name=AFI_greatest_hero>{{Cite web|url=http://connect.afi.com/site/DocServer/handv100.pdf?docID=246 |title=AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains |publisher=afi.com |access-date=2010-05-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807135547/http://connect.afi.com/site/DocServer/handv100.pdf?docID=246 |archivedate=August 7, 2011 |df=mdy}}</ref> In the 2018 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[To Kill a Mockingbird (2018 play)|stage play]] adapted by [[Aaron Sorkin]], Finch is portrayed by various actors including [[Jeff Daniels]], [[Ed Harris]], [[Greg Kinnear]], [[Rhys Ifans]] and [[Richard Thomas (actor)|Richard Thomas]].\n\n== Effect on the legal profession ==\nClaudia Durst Johnson has commented about critiques of the novel, saying, \"A greater volume of critical readings has been amassed by two legal scholars in law journals than by all the literary scholars in literary journals\".<ref>Johnson, ''Boundaries'' pp. 25\u201327</ref> Alice Petry remarked, \"Atticus has become something of a [[folk hero]] in legal circles and is treated almost as if he were an actual person\".<ref>Petry, p. xxiii</ref> Examples of Atticus Finch's impact on the legal profession are plentiful.

According to Jethva and others, the post-monsoon custom is to prepare the crop fields by deliberately burning the residual stubble between October and November.<ref name=\"Jethva2018\" /><ref name=\"Singh2017\"/> As crop productivity per hectare has increased with mechanised harvesting, this has led to the practice becoming more widespread in the northern and northwestern regions of India in the months when Diwali is observed.<ref name=\"Jethva2018\" /> The smoke from the burning of the fields is carried by seasonal winds over the floodplain, where it is inverted by the colder winds and spread throughout the region for much of the winter. Other contributors to the poor air quality include daily vehicular and industrial activity along with the burning of other biomass.<ref name=\"Jethva2018\">{{cite journal | last=Jethva | first=Hiren | last2=Chand | first2=Duli | last3=Torres | title=Agricultural Burning and Air Quality over Northern India: A Synergistic Analysis using NASA's A-train Satellite Data and Ground Measurements | journal=Aerosol and Air Quality Research | volume=18 | issue=7 | year=2018 | doi=10.4209/aaqr.2017.12.0583 | pages=1756\u20131773| doi-access=free }}</ref><ref name=\"Singh2017\">{{cite book | last=Singh | first=Jabrinder | last2=Singhal | first2=Naveen | last3=Singhal | first3=Shailey | last4=Sharma | title=Advances in Health and Environment Safety | chapter=Environmental Implications of Rice and Wheat Stubble Burning in North-Western States of India | publisher=Springer | year=2017 | isbn=978-981-10-7121-8 | doi=10.1007/978-981-10-7122-5_6 | pages=47\u201355}}</ref>\n\nA study of residential areas of Delhi in 2006-08, found that concentration of [[particulate matter]] as well as [[sulphur dioxide]] increased on the day of Diwali relative to other days of the month and that the increase could be exacerbated by prevailing meteorological conditions; there was also a correlated increase in [[noise pollution|ambient noise levels]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Papiya | first1 = M. | last2 = Mamta | first2 = P.  |title=Impact of Diwali celebrations on urban air and noise quality in Delhi City, India |journal=Environmental Monitoring & Assessment |volume=184 |issue=1 |pages=209\u2013215 |year=2012 |doi=10.1007/s10661-011-1960-7}}</ref> Another study of air pollution in Delhi found that the PM{{sub|2.5}} levels in 2015 and 2016 did rise over Diwali, but these higher levels were \"a result of contribution from fireworks on the Diwali night, trans-regional movement of pollutants due to crop residue burning, low wind speed, and high humidity\".

According to Jethva and others, the post-monsoon custom is to prepare the crop fields by deliberately burning the residual stubble between October and November.<ref name=\"Jethva2018\" /><ref name=\"Singh2017\"/> As crop productivity per hectare has increased with mechanised harvesting, this has led to the practice becoming more widespread in the northern and northwestern regions of India in the months when Diwali is observed.<ref name=\"Jethva2018\" /> The smoke from the burning of the fields is carried by seasonal winds over the floodplain, where it is inverted by the colder winds and spread throughout the region for much of the winter. Other contributors to the poor air quality include daily vehicular and industrial activity along with the burning of other biomass.<ref name=\"Jethva2018\">{{cite journal | last=Jethva | first=Hiren | last2=Chand | first2=Duli | last3=Torres | title=Agricultural Burning and Air Quality over Northern India: A Synergistic Analysis using NASA's A-train Satellite Data and Ground Measurements | journal=Aerosol and Air Quality Research | volume=18 | issue=7 | year=2018 | doi=10.4209/aaqr.2017.12.0583 | pages=1756\u20131773| doi-access=free }}</ref><ref name=\"Singh2017\">{{cite book | last=Singh | first=Jabrinder | last2=Singhal | first2=Naveen | last3=Singhal | first3=Shailey | last4=Sharma | title=Advances in Health and Environment Safety | chapter=Environmental Implications of Rice and Wheat Stubble Burning in North-Western States of India | publisher=Springer | year=2017 | isbn=978-981-10-7121-8 | doi=10.1007/978-981-10-7122-5_6 | pages=47\u201355}}</ref>\n\nA study of residential areas of Delhi in 2006-08, found that concentration of [[particulate matter]] as well as [[sulphur dioxide]] increased on the day of Diwali relative to other days of the month and that the increase could be exacerbated by prevailing meteorological conditions; there was also a correlated increase in [[noise pollution|ambient noise levels]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Papiya | first1 = M. | last2 = Mamta | first2 = P.  |title=Impact of Diwali celebrations on urban air and noise quality in Delhi City, India |journal=Environmental Monitoring & Assessment |volume=184 |issue=1 |pages=209\u2013215 |year=2012 |doi=10.1007/s10661-011-1960-7}}</ref> Another study of air pollution in Delhi found that the PM{{sub|2.5}} levels in 2015 and 2016 did rise over Diwali, but these higher levels were \"a result of contribution from fireworks on the Diwali night, trans-regional movement of pollutants due to crop residue burning, low wind speed, and high humidity\".

Bacteria can increase in number very quickly, which enables them to [[evolution|evolve]] rapidly. Should some bacteria survive a chemical attack, they give rise to new generations composed completely of bacteria that have resistance to the particular chemical used. Under a sustained chemical attack, the surviving bacteria in successive generations are increasingly resistant to the chemical used, and ultimately the chemical is rendered ineffective.

[[Chlorine]] and [[oxygen]] are strong oxidizers, so their compounds figure heavily here.\n\n*[[Electrolyzed water]] or \"Anolyte\" is an oxidizing, acidic hypochlorite solution made by [[electrolysis]] of [[sodium chloride]] into [[sodium hypochlorite]] and hypochlorous acid. Anolyte has an oxidation-reduction potential of +600 to +1200 mV and a typical pH range of 3.5\u2013\u20138.5, but the most potent solution is produced at a controlled pH 5.0\u20136.3 where the predominant oxychlorine species is [[hypochlorous acid]].\n*[[Hydrogen peroxide]] is used in [[hospital]]s to disinfect surfaces and it is used in solution alone or in combination with other chemicals as a high level disinfectant. Hydrogen peroxide is sometimes mixed with [[colloidal silver]]. It is often preferred because it causes far fewer [[allergic]] reactions than alternative disinfectants. Also used in the food packaging industry to disinfect foil containers. A 3% solution is also used as an antiseptic.\n* [[Vaporized hydrogen peroxide|Hydrogen peroxide vapor]] is used as a [[Sterilization (microbiology)|medical sterilant]] and as room disinfectant. Hydrogen peroxide has the advantage that it decomposes to form oxygen and water thus leaving no long term residues, but hydrogen peroxide as with most other strong oxidants is hazardous, and solutions are a primary irritant. The vapor is hazardous to the respiratory system and eyes and consequently the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] permissible exposure limit is 1 ppm (29 CFR 1910.1000 Table Z-1) calculated as an eight-hour time weighted average and the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|NIOSH]] immediately dangerous to life and health limit is 75 ppm.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/intridl4.html |title=CDC - Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health Concentrations (IDLH): Chemical Listing and Documentation of Revised IDLH Values - NIOSH Publications and Products |publisher=Cdc.gov |date=31 July 2009 |accessdate=10 November 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121117012820/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/intridl4.html |archivedate=17 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Therefore, engineering controls, personal protective equipment, gas monitoring etc. should be employed where high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide are used in the workplace.

It is chemically aggressive and destroys many organic compounds, resulting in rapid decolorization and deodorization in addition to disinfection. Ozone decomposes relatively quickly. However, due to this characteristic of ozone, tap water chlorination cannot be entirely replaced by ozonation, as the ozone would decompose already in the water piping. Instead, it is used to remove the bulk of oxidizable matter from the water, which would produce small amounts of [[organochloride]]s if treated with chlorine only. Regardless, ozone has a very wide range of applications from municipal to industrial water treatment due to its powerful reactivity. \n*[[Potassium permanganate]] (KMnO<sub>4</sub>) is a purplish-black crystalline powder that colours everything it touches, through a strong oxidising action. This includes staining \"stainless\" steel, which somehow limits its use and makes it necessary to use plastic or glass containers.  It is used to disinfect [[aquarium]]s and is  used in some community swimming pools as a foot disinfectant before entering the pool. Typically, a large shallow basin of KMnO<sub>4</sub> / water solution is kept near the pool ladder. Participants are required to step in the basin and then go into the pool. Additionally, it is widely used to disinfect community water ponds and wells in tropical countries, as well as to disinfect the mouth before pulling out teeth. It can be applied to wounds in dilute solution.\n\n=== Peroxy and peroxo acids ===\n[[Peroxy acid|Peroxycarboxylic acids and inorganic peroxo acids]] are strong oxidants and extremely effective disinfectants.\n\n* [[Peroxyformic acid]]\n* [[Peracetic acid]]\n* [[Peroxypropionic acid]]\n* [[Monoperoxyglutaric acid]]\n* [[Monoperoxysuccinic acid]]\n* [[Peroxybenzoic acid]]\n* [[Peroxyanisic acid]]\n* [[meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid|Chloroperbenzoic acid]]\n* [[Monoperoxyphthalic acid]]\n* [[Peroxymonosulfuric acid]]\n\n===Phenolics===\n[[Phenols|Phenolics]] are active ingredients in some household disinfectants.

Anolyte has an oxidation-reduction potential of +600 to +1200 mV and a typical pH range of 3.5\u2013\u20138.5, but the most potent solution is produced at a controlled pH 5.0\u20136.3 where the predominant oxychlorine species is [[hypochlorous acid]].\n*[[Hydrogen peroxide]] is used in [[hospital]]s to disinfect surfaces and it is used in solution alone or in combination with other chemicals as a high level disinfectant. Hydrogen peroxide is sometimes mixed with [[colloidal silver]]. It is often preferred because it causes far fewer [[allergic]] reactions than alternative disinfectants. Also used in the food packaging industry to disinfect foil containers. A 3% solution is also used as an antiseptic.\n* [[Vaporized hydrogen peroxide|Hydrogen peroxide vapor]] is used as a [[Sterilization (microbiology)|medical sterilant]] and as room disinfectant. Hydrogen peroxide has the advantage that it decomposes to form oxygen and water thus leaving no long term residues, but hydrogen peroxide as with most other strong oxidants is hazardous, and solutions are a primary irritant. The vapor is hazardous to the respiratory system and eyes and consequently the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] permissible exposure limit is 1 ppm (29 CFR 1910.1000 Table Z-1) calculated as an eight-hour time weighted average and the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|NIOSH]] immediately dangerous to life and health limit is 75 ppm.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/intridl4.html |title=CDC - Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health Concentrations (IDLH): Chemical Listing and Documentation of Revised IDLH Values - NIOSH Publications and Products |publisher=Cdc.gov |date=31 July 2009 |accessdate=10 November 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121117012820/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/intridl4.html |archivedate=17 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Therefore, engineering controls, personal protective equipment, gas monitoring etc. should be employed where high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide are used in the workplace. Vaporized hydrogen peroxide is one of the chemicals approved for decontamination of anthrax spores from contaminated buildings, such as occurred during the [[2001 anthrax attacks]] in the U.S. It has also been shown to be effective in removing exotic animal viruses, such as avian influenza and [[Newcastle disease]] from equipment and surfaces.\n* The antimicrobial action of hydrogen peroxide can be enhanced by [[surfactant]]s and organic acids. The resulting chemistry is known as Accelerated Hydrogen Peroxide. A 2% solution, stabilized for extended use, achieves high-level disinfection in 5 minutes, and is suitable for disinfecting medical equipment made from hard plastic, such as in [[endoscope]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Omidbakhsh|title= A new peroxide-based flexible endoscope-compatible high-level disinfectant |journal=American Journal of Infection Control |volume=34 |issue=9 |pages=571\u2013577 |year=2006 | pmid=17097451 |doi= 10.1016/j.ajic.2006.02.003|display-authors=etal}}</ref>  The evidence available suggests that products based on Accelerated Hydrogen Peroxide, apart from being good germicides, are safer for humans and benign to the environment.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Sattar|title= A product based on accelerated hydrogen peroxide: Evidence for broad-spectrum activity |journal=Canadian Journal of Infection Control |pages=123\u2013130 |date=Winter 1998 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n*[[Ozone]] is a gas used for disinfecting water, laundry, foods, air, and surfaces. It is chemically aggressive and destroys many organic compounds, resulting in rapid decolorization and deodorization in addition to disinfection. Ozone decomposes relatively quickly. However, due to this characteristic of ozone, tap water chlorination cannot be entirely replaced by ozonation, as the ozone would decompose already in the water piping. Instead, it is used to remove the bulk of oxidizable matter from the water, which would produce small amounts of [[organochloride]]s if treated with chlorine only. Regardless, ozone has a very wide range of applications from municipal to industrial water treatment due to its powerful reactivity. \n*[[Potassium permanganate]] (KMnO<sub>4</sub>) is a purplish-black crystalline powder that colours everything it touches, through a strong oxidising action. This includes staining \"stainless\" steel, which somehow limits its use and makes it necessary to use plastic or glass containers.  It is used to disinfect [[aquarium]]s and is  used in some community swimming pools as a foot disinfectant before entering the pool. Typically, a large shallow basin of KMnO<sub>4</sub> / water solution is kept near the pool ladder. Participants are required to step in the basin and then go into the pool. Additionally, it is widely used to disinfect community water ponds and wells in tropical countries, as well as to disinfect the mouth before pulling out teeth. It can be applied to wounds in dilute solution.\n\n=== Peroxy and peroxo acids ===\n[[Peroxy acid|Peroxycarboxylic acids and inorganic peroxo acids]] are strong oxidants and extremely effective disinfectants.\n\n* [[Peroxyformic acid]]\n* [[Peracetic acid]]\n* [[Peroxypropionic acid]]\n* [[Monoperoxyglutaric acid]]\n* [[Monoperoxysuccinic acid]]\n* [[Peroxybenzoic acid]]\n* [[Peroxyanisic acid]]\n* [[meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid|Chloroperbenzoic acid]]\n* [[Monoperoxyphthalic acid]]\n* [[Peroxymonosulfuric acid]]\n\n===Phenolics===\n[[Phenols|Phenolics]] are active ingredients in some household disinfectants.

It is rather corrosive to the skin and sometimes toxic to sensitive people. Impure preparations of phenol were originally made from [[coal tar]], and these contained low concentrations of other [[aromatic hydrocarbon]]s including [[benzene]], which is an [[International Agency for Research on Cancer|IARC]] [[List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens|Group 1]] [[carcinogen]].\n* [[2-Phenylphenol|''o''-Phenylphenol]] is often used instead of [[phenol]], since it is somewhat less corrosive.\n* [[Chloroxylenol]] is the principal ingredient in [[Dettol]], a household disinfectant and [[antiseptic]].\n* [[Hexachlorophene]] is a phenolic that was once used as a germicidal additive to some household products but was banned due to suspected harmful effects.\n* [[Thymol]], derived from the herb thyme, is the active ingredient in some \"broad spectrum\" disinfectants that often bear ecological claims. It is used as a stabilizer in pharmaceutic preparations. It has been used for its antiseptic, antibacterial, and antifungal actions, and was formerly used as a vermifuge.<ref name=\"nih.gov\">{{cite web|url=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov|title=The PubChem Project|website=pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808222031/http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/|archivedate=8 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> \n* [[Amylmetacresol]] is found in [[Strepsils]], a throat disinfectant.\n* Although not a phenol, [[2,4-dichlorobenzyl alcohol]] has similar effects as phenols, but it cannot inactivate viruses.\n\n===Quaternary ammonium compounds===\n\n[[Quaternary ammonium compounds]] (\"quats\"), such as [[benzalkonium chloride]], are a large group of related compounds. Some concentrated formulations have been shown to be effective low-level disinfectants. Quaternary ammonia at or above 200ppm plus alcohol solutions exhibit efficacy against difficult to kill non-enveloped viruses such as [[norovirus]], [[rotavirus]], or [[polio virus]].<ref name=\"cdc.gov\"/>  Newer synergous, low-alcohol formulations are highly effective broad-spectrum disinfectants with quick contact times (3\u20135 minutes) against bacteria, enveloped viruses, pathogenic fungi, and [[mycobacteria]].  Quats are biocides that also kill algae and are used as an additive in large-scale industrial water systems to minimize undesired biological growth.\n\n=== Inorganic compounds ===\n==== Chlorine ====\nThis group comprises aqueous solution of [[chlorine]], [[hypochlorite]], or [[hypochlorous acid]]. Occasionally, chlorine-releasing compounds and their salts are included in this group. Frequently, a concentration of < 1 ppm of available chlorine is sufficient to kill bacteria and viruses, spores and mycobacteria requiring higher concentrations.\nChlorine has been used for applications, such as the deactivation of pathogens in drinking water, swimming pool water and wastewater, for the disinfection of household areas and for textile bleaching<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lenntech.com/processes/disinfection/chemical/disinfectants-chlorine.htm|title=chlorine as disinfectant for water|website=www.lenntech.com|access-date=2019-12-12}}</ref>\n* [[Sodium hypochlorite]]\n* [[Calcium hypochlorite]]\n* [[Monochloramine]]\n* [[Chloramine-T]]\n* [[Trichloroisocyanuric acid]]\n* [[Chlorine dioxide]]\n* [[Hypochlorous acid]]\n\n==== Iodine ====\n* [[Iodine]]\n* [[Iodophor]]s\n==== Acids and bases ====\n* [[Sodium hydroxide]]\n* [[Potassium hydroxide]]\n* [[Calcium hydroxide]]\n* [[Magnesium hydroxide]]\n* [[Sulfurous acid]]\n* [[Sulfur dioxide]]\n====Metals====\n{{main|Oligodynamic effect}}\n\n=== Terpenes ===\n* [[Thymol]]\n* [[Pine oil]]\n\n===Other===\nThe [[biguanide]] [[polymer]] [[polyaminopropyl biguanide]] is specifically bactericidal at very low concentrations (10&nbsp;mg/l).

Phenol is the standard, and the corresponding rating system is called the \"[[Phenol coefficient]]\". The disinfectant to be tested is compared with phenol on a standard microbe (usually ''[[Salmonella typhi]]'' or ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]''). Disinfectants that are more effective than phenol have a coefficient &gt; 1. Those that are less effective have a coefficient &lt; 1.\n\nThe standard European approach for disinfectant validation consists of a basic suspension test, a quantitative suspension test (with low and high levels of organic material added to act as \u2018interfering substances\u2019) and a two part simulated-use surface test.<ref name=Sandle>{{cite book | editor = Sandle T | title = The CDC Handbook: A Guide to Cleaning and Disinfecting Cleanrooms  | edition = 1st | publisher = Grosvenor House Publishing Limited | year = 2012 | isbn = 978-1781487686}}</ref>\n\nA less specific measurement of effectiveness is the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) classification into either ''high'', ''intermediate'' or ''low'' levels of disinfection. \"High-level disinfection kills all organisms, except high levels of bacterial spores\" and is done with a chemical germicide marketed as a sterilant by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA). \"Intermediate-level disinfection kills mycobacteria, most viruses, and bacteria with a chemical germicide registered as a 'tuberculocide' by the Environmental Protection Agency.

As a young child, his father, a musician, showed him a love for the music that is now what keeps their family together. From a young age, De Jes\u00fas had the ability to play instruments that was incredible and that's where his love for music comes from. He has shown his skills at [[beatboxing]].

On his next tour, Brown flew the [[Northrop F-5|F-5E Tiger II]] with the [[527th Space Aggressor Squadron|527th Aggressor Squadron]] at [[RAF Alconbury|Royal Air Force station Alconbury]] in [[England]].{{sfn|Crickmore|2003|p=144}}\n\nIn 1985, he was selected to attend the [[U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School]] (TPS) at [[Edwards Air Force Base]] in [[California]] and graduated with Class 86A.<ref name=TPS50_p108>{{cite book |title = USAF Test Pilot School 50 Years and Beyond |year=1994 |page = 108}}</ref> His fellow students presented Brown with the [[Onizuka Prop Wash Award]] as the student who contributed most to class spirit and morale.<ref name=TPS50_p220>{{cite book |title = USAF Test Pilot School 50 Years and Beyond |year=1994 |page = 220}}</ref> The Prop Wash Award is dedicated to the memory of TPS graduate Colonel [[Ellison Onizuka]] who died as a member of the crew of the [[Space Shuttle Challenger|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'']] in 1986.<ref name=TPS50_p220/> Following graduation, Brown tested the [[A-7 Corsair II]], all models of the [[F-15 Eagle]], and performed flight trials on a number of classified prototype aircraft. In 1992, after sixteen years of service, Brown separated from the Air Force.{{sfn|Rogers|2006}}\n\n==Civilian career==\nBrown interviewed with [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] for a test pilot position but, because of reduced military spending after the end of the [[Cold War]], no openings were available. He joined [[United Airlines]] in 1992 and flew the [[Boeing 737]] over North and Central America.

Aware of a similar situation that resulted in the loss of an F-117, Brown idled the ailing engine rather than shut it down. The second engine began losing power during the landing approach. Brown's unconventional technique to handling the initial problem allowed him to narrowly avoid a much more serious situation.{{sfn|Karlin|2008}}\n\nIn 2006, Brown was the lead test pilot for the F-22 Raptor program at Edwards Air Force Base.{{sfn|Rodela|2006}} By 2008, Brown had logged over 7,600 flight hours in 124 different types of aircraft.{{sfn|Karlin|2008}} In July 2011, Brown was promoted to Chief Test Pilot of the F-22 Raptor program for Lockheed Martin. In 2012, he became the first test pilot to reach 1,000 flight hours in the F-22.

On his next tour, Brown flew the [[Northrop F-5|F-5E Tiger II]] with the [[527th Space Aggressor Squadron|527th Aggressor Squadron]] at [[RAF Alconbury|Royal Air Force station Alconbury]] in [[England]].{{sfn|Crickmore|2003|p=144}}\n\nIn 1985, he was selected to attend the [[U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School]] (TPS) at [[Edwards Air Force Base]] in [[California]] and graduated with Class 86A.<ref name=TPS50_p108>{{cite book |title = USAF Test Pilot School 50 Years and Beyond |year=1994 |page = 108}}</ref> His fellow students presented Brown with the [[Onizuka Prop Wash Award]] as the student who contributed most to class spirit and morale.<ref name=TPS50_p220>{{cite book |title = USAF Test Pilot School 50 Years and Beyond |year=1994 |page = 220}}</ref> The Prop Wash Award is dedicated to the memory of TPS graduate Colonel [[Ellison Onizuka]] who died as a member of the crew of the [[Space Shuttle Challenger|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'']] in 1986.<ref name=TPS50_p220/> Following graduation, Brown tested the [[A-7 Corsair II]], all models of the [[F-15 Eagle]], and performed flight trials on a number of classified prototype aircraft. In 1992, after sixteen years of service, Brown separated from the Air Force.{{sfn|Rogers|2006}}\n\n==Civilian career==\nBrown interviewed with [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] for a test pilot position but, because of reduced military spending after the end of the [[Cold War]], no openings were available. He joined [[United Airlines]] in 1992 and flew the [[Boeing 737]] over North and Central America. Pursuing his boyhood dream, Brown applied to the NASA astronaut-training program but was rejected because of an abnormal electrocardiogram.{{sfn|Karlin|2008}}\n\n===F-117 Nighthawk===\n[[File:JB Brown Lead IRRCA Test Pilot 1998.jpg|right|thumb|JB Brown prepares for an F-117 test mission]]\nIn 1994, he was hired by the Lockheed Skunk Works as a test pilot for the F-117 Nighthawk, where he helped develop and test improvements to the weapons system that proved valuable in [[Operation Allied Force]] and [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]].{{sfn|Rodela|2006}} One such improvement was the Integrated Real-time Information into the Cockpit/Real-time Information Out of the Cockpit for Combat Aircraft (IRRCA) project. In 1998 as IRRCA lead test pilot, Brown flew a simulated combat mission to demonstrate the ability to receive real-time mission updates from a satellite and automatically alter the F-117's planned route.{{sfn|Crickmore|2003|p=143}}<ref name=F117_IRRCA>{{cite news|title=F-117 testers evaluate real-time information capability |url=http://www.edwards.af.mil/archive/1998/9809_F117.html |work=Desert Wings |publisher=USAF Flight Test Center Public Affairs |location=Edwards Air Force Base, California |date=September 1998 |accessdate=January 13, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901182557/http://www.edwards.af.mil/archive/1998/9809_F117.html |archivedate=September 1, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The flight also demonstrated reception of text and imagery of the alternate target.{{sfn|Crickmore|2003|p=143}} Brown encouraged young engineers by presenting lectures such as ''Braking the F-117 Stealth Fighter'' given to the [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]] student chapter at the [[University of California, San Diego]].{{sfn|Lowry|1999}} He continued his education and earned a [[Master of Science]] degree in [[Management]] from [[Troy University|Troy State University]] in [[Alabama]] and completed graduate study in [[mechanical engineering]] at [[California State University, Fresno]].{{sfn|Rogers|2006}}\n\n===F-22 Raptor===\n[[File:JB Brown launches AIM-9 2002.jpg|right|thumb|Flying Raptor 4007, JB Brown launches an AIM-9 missile]]\nIn 2002, after eight years with F-117 program, Brown transferred to the [[F-22 Raptor]].{{sfn|Rodela|2006}} In this new role, he evaluated updated versions of the avionics software and improved the pilot-vehicle interface.{{sfn|Karlin|2008}} On November 22, 2002, Brown flew the mission that completed all Pentagon-mandated flight test goals needed to start the next phase of the program.<ref name=Raptor_Test_Goals>{{cite book |title=F/A-22 Raptor Meets Program's Final 2002 Flight-Test Goal |year = 2002}}</ref>{{sfn|Bierstine|2002}} On this mission, Brown fired an [[AIM-9 Sidewinder|AIM-9M Sidewinder]] missile at a supersonic QF-4 unmanned drone flying several miles directly ahead of the F-22.<ref name=Raptor_Test_Goals/> The unarmed missile passed close enough to the target to be assessed a lethal hit, satisfying the criteria needed to start the Dedicated Initial Operational Test & Evaluation (DIOTE) phase the following year.<ref name=Raptor_Test_Goals/>{{sfn|Bierstine|2002}}\n\nBrown has successfully dealt with many F-22 emergencies including a fuel leak at 30,000 feet while traveling at nearly the speed of sound.{{sfn|Puckett|2005}} On another flight, a mechanical problem affected one of the two jet engines shortly after take off. Aware of a similar situation that resulted in the loss of an F-117, Brown idled the ailing engine rather than shut it down. The second engine began losing power during the landing approach. Brown's unconventional technique to handling the initial problem allowed him to narrowly avoid a much more serious situation.{{sfn|Karlin|2008}}\n\nIn 2006, Brown was the lead test pilot for the F-22 Raptor program at Edwards Air Force Base.{{sfn|Rodela|2006}} By 2008, Brown had logged over 7,600 flight hours in 124 different types of aircraft.{{sfn|Karlin|2008}} In July 2011, Brown was promoted to Chief Test Pilot of the F-22 Raptor program for Lockheed Martin. In 2012, he became the first test pilot to reach 1,000 flight hours in the F-22. Including his hours in the F-117, Brown had more flight time in stealth jets than any other pilot in the world.{{sfn|Reynolds|2012}}\n\n===Skunk Works and NTPS===\nIn 2013, Brown accepted the position of Chief of Flight Operations for the Lockheed Martin Skunk Works providing flight test oversight for evaluations of new technologies.{{sfn|Reynolds|2015}} Brown retired from Lockheed in January 2016 and joined the National Test Pilot School (NTPS) as chief operations officer and test pilot instructor.<ref name=NTPS-2016>{{cite web |title = James E.
