It is modeled after the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA).\n\n==History and mission==\n\n===Legislative history===\nThe concept of ARPA-E was initially conceived by a report by the [[National Academies of the United States|National Academies]] entitled ''Rising Above the Gathering Storm: Energizing and Employing America for a Brighter Economic Future''.  The report recognized a U.S. need to stimulate innovation and develop clean, affordable, and reliable energy.<ref>ARPA-E  FY2010 Annual Report, http://arpa-e.energy.gov/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=JPgM-ETf-o0%3d&tabid=438.</ref>  ARPA-E was officially created by the [[America COMPETES Act]] <!-- H.R. 364 ? -->, authored by Congressman [[Bart Gordon]],<ref>https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-bill/5325?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22America+Competes+Act+2007%22%5D%7D</ref> within the [[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE) in 2007, though without a budget.

ARPA-E has four objectives:\n\n# To bring a freshness, excitement, and sense of mission to energy research that will attract the U.S.'s best and brightest minds; \n# To focus on creative, transformation energy research that the industry cannot, or will not support due to its high risk, but that has high reward potential; \n# To utilize an ARPA-like organization that is flat, nimble, and sparse, capable of sustaining for long periods of time those projects whose promise remains real, while phasing out programs that do not prove to be as promising as anticipated; and \n# To create a new tool to bridge the gap between basic energy research and development/industrial innovation.<ref name=\"About ARPA-E\"/>\n\n=== Launch ===\nPresident [[Barack Obama]] announced the launch of the Advanced Research Projects Agency\u2013Energy (ARPA-E) on April 27, 2009 as part of an announcement about federal investment in research and development and science education. Soon after its launch, ARPA-E released its first [[Funding Opportunity Announcement]] for the new agency, offering $151 million in total with individual awards ranging from $500,000 to $9 million.

This goal is similar to the work of the U.S. Department of Energy's [[Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy|Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)]] which advances clean energy projects according to established roadmaps.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://energy.gov/eere/downloads/eere-strategic-plan|title=EERE Strategic Plan {{!}} Department of Energy|website=energy.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-01-18}}</ref>, However, ARPA-E also funds advanced technology in other spaces such as natural gas and grid technology.<ref>https://arpa-e.energy.gov/?q=arpa-e-programs/monitor</ref> <ref>https://arpa-e.energy.gov/?q=arpa-e-programs/move</ref> <ref>https://arpa-e.energy.gov/?q=arpa-e-programs/grid-data</ref>ARPA-E does not fund incremental improvements to existing technologies; nor roadmaps established by existing DOE programs.<ref>\u201cOne of ARPA-E\u2019s strengths is its focus on funding high-risk, potentially transformative technologies and overlooked, \u201coff-roadmap\u201d opportunities pursued by neither private firms nor other funding agencies, including other programs and offices within DoE.\u201d (NASEM report on ARPA-E, Finding 4-4).  https://www.nap.edu/catalog/24778/an-assessment-of-arpa-e</ref>\n\n== Project creation and the review process ==\n\nARPA-E programs are created through a process of rigorous debate surrounding the technical/scientific merits and challenges of potential research areas and must satisfy both concepts of \u201ctechnology push\u201d\u2014the technical merit of innovative platform technologies that can be applied to energy systems\u2014and \u201cmarket pull\u201d\u2014the potential market impact and cost-effectiveness of the technology.\n\n=== Project creation ===\n{{Advert|date=August 2018}}\nThe detailed program creation process begins with a \u201cdeep dive\u201d: a process of thoroughly exploring an aspect of the energy problem to identify potential topics for program development. ARPA-E Program Directors then hold technical workshops to gather input from the world's leading experts about current state-of-the-art technologies and new technological opportunities that lie on the horizon. By bringing together experts from all walks of science, technology, and business, ARPA-E breaks down silos between disciplines. This cross-disciplinary inquiry is essential to bridge the gap between basic and applied \nresearch and development. ARPA-E workshops bring together the best and the brightest to identify technical challenges and opportunities that connect science to technology and markets\u2014linking knowledge of what science is capable of to what technology can achieve and what the market needs. To date, ARPA-E has hosted or co-hosted 13 technical workshops.\n\nFollowing each workshop, the Program Director proposes a new program and defends the program against a set of criteria that justifies its creation. After intense, \u201cconstructive confrontation\u201d and debate involving all ARPA-E Program Directors, the Program Director refines the program, incorporating internal and external feedback, and seeks approval from the Director. If successful, a new ARPA-E program is created, and a solicitation, or funding opportunity announcement (FOA), is released, soliciting project proposals.\n\n=== Peer review process ===\n\nThe ARPA-E peer review process is designed to help drive toward subsequent program success. During proposal review, ARPA-E solicits external inputs to make sure that it is funding the best technologies. ARPA-E taps the expertise of dozens of the leading experts in the world in a particular field for in-depth proposal reviews. The involvement of world-class scientists, engineers, and leaders from the technical community brings expertise and knowledge to the process. ARPA-E reviewers evaluate applications over several weeks, and \nthen come together for a review panel.\n\nOne notable facet of ARPA-E's evaluation process is the opportunity for the applicant to read reviewers\u2019 comments and to provide a rebuttal that the Agency reviews before making funding decisions. The applicant response period allows ARPA-E to avoid misunderstandings by asking clarifying questions that enable ARPA-E to make the most informed decisions during the project selection process and identify the most compelling and meritorious ideas for support.<ref>ARPA-E FY2010 Annual Report, http://arpa-e.energy.gov/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=JPgM-ETf-o0%3d&tabid=438.</ref>\n\n== Funding and awards ==\n\n=== First funding opportunity ===\nThe U.S. Department of Energy and ARPA-E awarded $151 million in [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act]] funds on October 26, 2009 for 37 energy research projects. It supported [[renewable energy]] technologies for [[solar cell]]s, [[wind turbine]]s, [[geothermal drilling]], [[biofuel]]s, and [[biomass energy crop]]s.

IMPAACT awarded projects such as GE's Global Research Center's \"CO2 Capture Process Using Phase-Changing Absorbents,\" which focuses on a liquid that turns into a solid powder when reacting with carbon dioxide.<ref name=\"arpa-e.energy.gov\"/>\n\n=== Third funding opportunity ===\n\nOn March 2, 2010, at the inaugural ARPA-E Energy Innovation Summit, U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu announced a third funding opportunity for ARPA-E projects.  Like the second funding opportunity, ARPA-E solicited projects by category: Grid-Scale Rampable Intermittent Dispatchable Storage (GRIDS), Agile Delivery of Electrical Power Technology (ADEPT), and Building Energy Efficiency Through Innovative Thermodevices (BEET-IT).  GRIDS welcomed projects that focused on widespread deployment of cost-effective grid-scale energy storage in two specific areas: 1) proof of concept storage component projects focused on validating new, over-the-horizon electrical energy storage concepts, and 2) advanced system prototypes that address critical shortcomings of existing grid-scale energy storage technologies.  ADEPT focused on investing in materials for fundamental advances in soft magnetics, high voltage switches, and reliable, high-density charge storage in three categories: 1) fully integrated, chip-scale power converters for applications including, but not limited to, compact, efficient drivers for solid-state lighting, distributed micro-inverters for photovoltaics, and single-chip power supplies for computers, 2) kilowatt scale package integrated power converters by enabling applications such as low-cost, efficient inverters for grid-tied photovoltaics and variable speed motors, and 3) lightweight, solid-state, medium voltage energy conversion for high power applications such as solid-state electrical substations and wind turbine generators.  BEET-IT solicited projects regarding energy efficient cooling technologies and air conditioners (AC) for buildings to save energy and reduce GHG emissions in the following areas:  1) cooling systems that use refrigerants with low global warming potential; 2) energy efficient air conditioning (AC) systems for warm and humid climates with an increased coefficient of performance (COP); and 3) vapor compression AC systems for hot climates for re-circulating air loads with an increased COP.<ref>DOE Announces $100 Million Available for Innovative Research, {{cite web|url=http://arpa-e.energy.gov/media/news/tabid/83/vw/1/itemid/19/doe-announces-%24100-million-available-for-innovative-research-projects.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309142001/http://arpa-e.energy.gov/media/news/tabid/83/vw/1/itemid/19/doe-announces-%24100-million-available-for-innovative-research-projects.aspx |archivedate=2012-03-09 }}</ref>\n\nSecretary Chu announced the selection of 43 projects under GRIDS, ADEPT, and BEET-IT on July 12, 2010.

This goal is similar to the work of the U.S. Department of Energy's [[Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy|Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)]] which advances clean energy projects according to established roadmaps.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://energy.gov/eere/downloads/eere-strategic-plan|title=EERE Strategic Plan {{!}} Department of Energy|website=energy.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-01-18}}</ref>, However, ARPA-E also funds advanced technology in other spaces such as natural gas and grid technology.<ref>https://arpa-e.energy.gov/?q=arpa-e-programs/monitor</ref> <ref>https://arpa-e.energy.gov/?q=arpa-e-programs/move</ref> <ref>https://arpa-e.energy.gov/?q=arpa-e-programs/grid-data</ref>ARPA-E does not fund incremental improvements to existing technologies; nor roadmaps established by existing DOE programs.<ref>\u201cOne of ARPA-E\u2019s strengths is its focus on funding high-risk, potentially transformative technologies and overlooked, \u201coff-roadmap\u201d opportunities pursued by neither private firms nor other funding agencies, including other programs and offices within DoE.\u201d (NASEM report on ARPA-E, Finding 4-4).  https://www.nap.edu/catalog/24778/an-assessment-of-arpa-e</ref>\n\n== Project creation and the review process ==\n\nARPA-E programs are created through a process of rigorous debate surrounding the technical/scientific merits and challenges of potential research areas and must satisfy both concepts of \u201ctechnology push\u201d\u2014the technical merit of innovative platform technologies that can be applied to energy systems\u2014and \u201cmarket pull\u201d\u2014the potential market impact and cost-effectiveness of the technology.\n\n=== Project creation ===\n{{Advert|date=August 2018}}\nThe detailed program creation process begins with a \u201cdeep dive\u201d: a process of thoroughly exploring an aspect of the energy problem to identify potential topics for program development. ARPA-E Program Directors then hold technical workshops to gather input from the world's leading experts about current state-of-the-art technologies and new technological opportunities that lie on the horizon. By bringing together experts from all walks of science, technology, and business, ARPA-E breaks down silos between disciplines. This cross-disciplinary inquiry is essential to bridge the gap between basic and applied \nresearch and development. ARPA-E workshops bring together the best and the brightest to identify technical challenges and opportunities that connect science to technology and markets\u2014linking knowledge of what science is capable of to what technology can achieve and what the market needs. To date, ARPA-E has hosted or co-hosted 13 technical workshops.\n\nFollowing each workshop, the Program Director proposes a new program and defends the program against a set of criteria that justifies its creation. After intense, \u201cconstructive confrontation\u201d and debate involving all ARPA-E Program Directors, the Program Director refines the program, incorporating internal and external feedback, and seeks approval from the Director. If successful, a new ARPA-E program is created, and a solicitation, or funding opportunity announcement (FOA), is released, soliciting project proposals.\n\n=== Peer review process ===\n\nThe ARPA-E peer review process is designed to help drive toward subsequent program success. During proposal review, ARPA-E solicits external inputs to make sure that it is funding the best technologies. ARPA-E taps the expertise of dozens of the leading experts in the world in a particular field for in-depth proposal reviews. The involvement of world-class scientists, engineers, and leaders from the technical community brings expertise and knowledge to the process. ARPA-E reviewers evaluate applications over several weeks, and \nthen come together for a review panel.\n\nOne notable facet of ARPA-E's evaluation process is the opportunity for the applicant to read reviewers\u2019 comments and to provide a rebuttal that the Agency reviews before making funding decisions. The applicant response period allows ARPA-E to avoid misunderstandings by asking clarifying questions that enable ARPA-E to make the most informed decisions during the project selection process and identify the most compelling and meritorious ideas for support.<ref>ARPA-E FY2010 Annual Report, http://arpa-e.energy.gov/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=JPgM-ETf-o0%3d&tabid=438.</ref>\n\n== Funding and awards ==\n\n=== First funding opportunity ===\nThe U.S. Department of Energy and ARPA-E awarded $151 million in [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act]] funds on October 26, 2009 for 37 energy research projects. It supported [[renewable energy]] technologies for [[solar cell]]s, [[wind turbine]]s, [[geothermal drilling]], [[biofuel]]s, and [[biomass energy crop]]s. The grants also supported [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] technologies, including [[power electronics]] and [[engine-generator]]s for [[advanced vehicle]]s, devices for [[waste heat recovery]], [[smart glass]] and control systems for [[smart building]]s, [[light-emitting diode]]s (LEDs), [[reverse-osmosis membrane]]s for [[water desalination]], [[catalyst]]s to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, improved [[fuel cell]] membranes, and more energy-dense [[magnetic material]]s for electronic components.

Like the second funding opportunity, ARPA-E solicited projects by category: Grid-Scale Rampable Intermittent Dispatchable Storage (GRIDS), Agile Delivery of Electrical Power Technology (ADEPT), and Building Energy Efficiency Through Innovative Thermodevices (BEET-IT).  GRIDS welcomed projects that focused on widespread deployment of cost-effective grid-scale energy storage in two specific areas: 1) proof of concept storage component projects focused on validating new, over-the-horizon electrical energy storage concepts, and 2) advanced system prototypes that address critical shortcomings of existing grid-scale energy storage technologies.  ADEPT focused on investing in materials for fundamental advances in soft magnetics, high voltage switches, and reliable, high-density charge storage in three categories: 1) fully integrated, chip-scale power converters for applications including, but not limited to, compact, efficient drivers for solid-state lighting, distributed micro-inverters for photovoltaics, and single-chip power supplies for computers, 2) kilowatt scale package integrated power converters by enabling applications such as low-cost, efficient inverters for grid-tied photovoltaics and variable speed motors, and 3) lightweight, solid-state, medium voltage energy conversion for high power applications such as solid-state electrical substations and wind turbine generators.  BEET-IT solicited projects regarding energy efficient cooling technologies and air conditioners (AC) for buildings to save energy and reduce GHG emissions in the following areas:  1) cooling systems that use refrigerants with low global warming potential; 2) energy efficient air conditioning (AC) systems for warm and humid climates with an increased coefficient of performance (COP); and 3) vapor compression AC systems for hot climates for re-circulating air loads with an increased COP.<ref>DOE Announces $100 Million Available for Innovative Research, {{cite web|url=http://arpa-e.energy.gov/media/news/tabid/83/vw/1/itemid/19/doe-announces-%24100-million-available-for-innovative-research-projects.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309142001/http://arpa-e.energy.gov/media/news/tabid/83/vw/1/itemid/19/doe-announces-%24100-million-available-for-innovative-research-projects.aspx |archivedate=2012-03-09 }}</ref>\n\nSecretary Chu announced the selection of 43 projects under GRIDS, ADEPT, and BEET-IT on July 12, 2010.

He is the son of former [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and Danish international goalkeeper [[Peter Schmeichel]].\n\nSchmeichel began his career with [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], but he had loan spells with [[Darlington F.C.|Darlington]], [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] and [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]] before he made his Manchester City debut. Although Schmeichel appeared to have made the City number 1 jersey his own at the start of the 2007\u201308 season, the emergence of [[Joe Hart]] resulted in Schmeichel being loaned to [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]]. The signing of Republic of Ireland international [[Shay Given]] in January 2009 meant that Schmeichel fell even further down the pecking order at City, and in August 2009, he was allowed to link up with former manager [[Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson]] at [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]]. He spent only one season with the Magpies as, while it was a very successful one for the club and the player himself, changes to the club's financial position made his departure necessary and his contract was terminated by mutual consent. He joined [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] in May 2010, but again, his tenure at the club would only last one season before he was the subject of a transfer to Leicester City, where he would again work under Eriksson. Schmeichel has gone on to play over 300 competitive games for Leicester, winning the Championship in the 2013\u201314 season and the Premier League in 2015\u201316.\n\nHe played 17 games for the [[Denmark national under-21 football team|Denmark national under-21 team]].

He is the son of former [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and Danish international goalkeeper [[Peter Schmeichel]].\n\nSchmeichel began his career with [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], but he had loan spells with [[Darlington F.C.|Darlington]], [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] and [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]] before he made his Manchester City debut. Although Schmeichel appeared to have made the City number 1 jersey his own at the start of the 2007\u201308 season, the emergence of [[Joe Hart]] resulted in Schmeichel being loaned to [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]]. The signing of Republic of Ireland international [[Shay Given]] in January 2009 meant that Schmeichel fell even further down the pecking order at City, and in August 2009, he was allowed to link up with former manager [[Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson]] at [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]]. He spent only one season with the Magpies as, while it was a very successful one for the club and the player himself, changes to the club's financial position made his departure necessary and his contract was terminated by mutual consent. He joined [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] in May 2010, but again, his tenure at the club would only last one season before he was the subject of a transfer to Leicester City, where he would again work under Eriksson. Schmeichel has gone on to play over 300 competitive games for Leicester, winning the Championship in the 2013\u201314 season and the Premier League in 2015\u201316.\n\nHe played 17 games for the [[Denmark national under-21 football team|Denmark national under-21 team]].

{"title_page": "Homogeneous charge compression ignition", "text_new": "'''Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition ''' ('''HCCI''') is a form of [[internal combustion engine|internal combustion]] in which well-mixed [[fuel]] and [[oxidizer]] (typically air) are compressed to the point of auto-ignition. As in other forms of [[combustion]], this [[exothermic reaction]] releases energy that can be transformed in an engine into [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] and heat.\n\nHCCI combines characteristics of conventional [[gasoline engine]] and [[diesel engine]]s. Gasoline engines combine ''homogeneous charge''  (HC) with ''[[spark ignition]]'' (SI), abbreviated as HCSI. Modern direct injection diesel engines combine ''[[stratified charge]]'' (SC) with ''[[compression ignition]]'' (CI), abbreviated as SCCI.\n\nAs in HCSI, HCCI injects fuel during the intake stroke. However, rather than using an electric discharge (spark) to ignite a portion of the mixture, HCCI raises density and temperature by compression until the entire mixture reacts spontaneously.\n\nStratified charge compression ignition also relies on temperature and density increase resulting from compression. However, it injects fuel later, during the compression stroke. Combustion occurs at the boundary of the fuel and air, producing higher emissions, but allowing a [[Lean burn|leaner]] and higher temperature compression burn, producing greater efficiency.\n\n[[control theory|Controlling]] HCCI requires microprocessor control and physical understanding of the ignition process. HCCI designs achieve gasoline engine-like emissions with diesel engine-like efficiency.\n\nHCCI engines achieve extremely low levels of [[Nitrogen oxide|oxides of nitrogen]] emissions ({{chem|NO|x}}) without a [[catalytic converter]]. Hydrocarbons (unburnt fuels and oils) and carbon monoxide emissions still require  treatment to meet [[automobile emissions control]] regulations.\n\nRecent research has shown that the hybrid fuels combining different reactivities (such as gasoline and diesel) can help in controlling HCCI ignition and burn rates. RCCI, or [[reactivity controlled compression ignition]], has been demonstrated to provide highly efficient, low emissions operation over wide load and speed ranges.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.engr.wisc.edu/news/headlines/2009/Aug03.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225044550/http://www.engr.wisc.edu/news/headlines/2009/Aug03.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2010-02-25 |title=College of Engineering @ The University of Wisconsin-Madison, initiatives in energy, health, nanotechnology, security, and information technology |publisher=Engr.wisc.edu |accessdate=2014-03-31 }}</ref>.\n\n== History ==\n\nHCCI engines have a long history, even though HCCI has not been as widely implemented as spark ignition or diesel injection. It is essentially an [[Otto cycle|Otto combustion cycle]]. HCCI was popular before electronic [[ignition system|spark ignition]] was used. One example is the [[Hot bulb engine|hot-bulb engine]] which used a hot vaporization chamber to help mix fuel with air. The extra heat combined with compression induced the conditions for combustion. Another example is the [[Carbureted compression ignition model engine|\"diesel\" model aircraft engine]].\n\n== Operation ==\n\n=== Methods ===\n\nA mixture of fuel and air ignites when the concentration and temperature of reactants is sufficiently high. The concentration and/or temperature can be increased in several different ways:\n\n* Increasing compression ratio\n* Pre-heating of induction gases\n* Forced induction\n* Retained or re-inducted exhaust gases\n\nOnce ignited, combustion occurs very quickly. When auto-ignition occurs too early or with too much chemical energy, combustion is too fast and high in-cylinder pressures can destroy an engine. For this reason, HCCI is typically operated at lean overall fuel mixtures.\n\n=== Advantages ===\n\n* Since HCCI engines are fuel-lean, they can operate at diesel-like compression ratios (>15), thus achieving 30% higher efficiencies than conventional SI gasoline engines.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | first1 = Fuquan\n | last1  = Zhao\n | first2 = Thomas W.\n | last2  = Asmus\n | first3 = Dennis N.\n | last3  = Assanis\n | first4 = John E.\n | last4  = Dec\n | first5 = James A.\n | last5  = Eng\n | first6 = Paul M.\n | last6  = Najt\n | title = Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) Engines: Key Research and Development Issues\n | publisher = [[Society of Automotive Engineers]]\n | location = Warrendale, PA, USA\n | year = 2003\n | pages = 11\u201312\n | isbn = 0-7680-1123-X }}\n</ref>\n* Homogeneous mixing of fuel and air leads to cleaner combustion and lower emissions.

In a typical [[gasoline engine]], a spark is used to ignite the pre-mixed fuel and air. In [[Diesel engines]], combustion begins when the fuel is injected into pre-compressed air. In both cases, combustion timing is explicitly controlled. In an HCCI engine, however, the homogeneous mixture of fuel and air is compressed and combustion begins whenever sufficient pressure and temperature are reached. This means that no well-defined combustion initiator provides direct control. Engines must be designed so that ignition conditions occur at the desired timing. To achieve dynamic operation, the [[control system]] must manage the conditions that induce combustion. Options include the compression ratio, inducted gas temperature, inducted gas pressure, fuel-air ratio, or quantity of retained or re-inducted exhaust. Several control approaches are discussed below.\n\n==== Compression ratio ====\n\nTwo compression ratios are significant. The ''[[geometric compression ratio]]'' can be changed with a movable plunger at the top of the [[cylinder head]]. This system is used in diesel [[Model engine|model aircraft engines]]. The ''[[effective compression ratio]]'' can be reduced from the geometric ratio by closing the intake valve either very late or very early with [[variable valve actuation]] ([[variable valve timing]] that enables the [[Miller cycle]]). Both approaches require energy to achieve fast response. Additionally, implementation is expensive, but is effective.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | first1 = Goran | last1  = Haraldsson\n | first2 = Jari | last2  = Hyvonen\n | first3 = Per | last3  = Tunestal\n | first4 = Bengt | last4  = Johansson\n | year = 2002\n | title = SAE Technical Paper 2002-01-2858\n | volume = <!-- -->\n | chapter = HCCI Combustion Phasing in a Multi Cylinder Engine Using Variable Compression Ratio\n | series = SAE Technical Paper Series\n | doi = 10.4271/2002-01-2858\n}}</ref> The effect of compression ratio on HCCI combustion has also been studied extensively.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n | last1 = Aceves | first1 = S.

The exhaust has dual effects on HCCI combustion. It dilutes the fresh charge, delaying ignition and reducing the chemical energy and engine output. Hot combustion products conversely increase gas temperature in the cylinder and advance ignition. Control of combustion timing HCCI engines using EGR has been shown experimentally.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n | first1 = Michael\n | last1  = Au\n | first2 = J.

VVA can achieve this via either:\n\n* Controlling the effective compression ratio: VVA on intake can control the point at which the intake valve closes. Retarding past bottom dead center (BDC), changes the compression ratio, altering the in-cylinder pressure-time envelope.\n* Controlling the amount of hot exhaust gas retained in the combustion chamber: VVA can control the amount of hot EGR within the combustion chamber, either by valve re-opening or changes in valve overlap. Balancing the percentage of cooled external EGR with the hot internal EGR generated by a VVA system, makes it possible to control the in-cylinder temperature.\n\nWhile electro-hydraulic and camless VVA systems offer control over the valve event, the componentry for such systems is currently complicated and expensive. Mechanical variable lift and duration systems, however, although more complex than a standard valvetrain, are cheaper and less complicated. It is relatively simple to configure such systems to achieve the necessary control over the valve lift curve.\n\n==== Fuel mixture ====\n\nAnother means to extend the operating range is to control the onset of ignition and the heat release rate<ref>[http://www.cmclinnovations.com/userstories/userstory1.html Controlling Heat Release Using Advanced Fuels] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405164105/http://www.cmclinnovations.com/userstories/userstory1.html |date=2011-04-05 }}</ref><ref>\n{{cite journal\n | last = Smallbone\n | first = Andrew\n | author2 = Amit Bhave\n | author3 = Neal M.

Ignition timing varies with the ratio of these fuels.\n* In-chamber blending: One fuel can be injected in the intake duct (port injection) and the other directly into the cylinder.\n\n==== Direct Injection: PCCI or PPCI Combustion ====\n\nCompression Ignition Direct Injection (CIDI) combustion is a well-established means of controlling ignition timing and heat release rate and is adopted in [[diesel engine]] combustion. [[Partially premixed combustion|Partially Pre-mixed Charge Compression Ignition]] (PPCI) also known as Premixed Charge Compression Ignition (PCCI) is a compromise offering the control of CIDI combustion with the reduced exhaust gas emissions of HCCI, specifically lower [[soot]].<ref name=\"Kal\">{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1115/1.4000602|title = Low NOx and Low Smoke Operation of a Diesel Engine Using Gasolinelike Fuels|journal = Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power|volume = 132|issue = 9|year = 2010|last1 = Kalghatgi|first1 = Gautam|last2 = Hildingsson|first2 = Leif|last3 = Johansson|first3 = Bengt}}</ref> The heat release rate is controlled by preparing the combustible mixture in such a way that combustion occurs over a longer time duration making it less prone to [[engine knocking|knocking]]. This is done by timing the injection event such that a range of air/fuel ratios spread across the combustion cylinder when ignition begins. Ignition occurs in different regions of the combustion chamber at different times - slowing the heat release rate. This mixture is designed to minimize the number of fuel-rich pockets, reducing soot formation.<ref name=\"cmcl2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cmclinnovations.com/userstories/userstory2.html |title=Partially-Premixed Compression Ignition (PPCI) and Low-Temperature Combustion (LTC) modes |website=Cmcl |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309041652/http://www.cmclinnovations.com/userstories/userstory2.html |archive-date=2012-03-09 |url-status=dead |access-date=2016-04-06 |quote=One promising approach is that of Partially-Premixed Compression Ignition (PPCI) or Low Temperature Combustion (LTC) mode.

Hence at any point in time, only a fraction of the total fuel is burning. This results in low peak pressures and low energy release rates. In HCCI however, the entire fuel/air mixture ignites and burns over a much smaller time interval, resulting in high peak pressures and high energy release rates. To withstand the higher pressures, the engine has to be structurally stronger. Several strategies have been proposed to lower the rate of combustion and peak pressure. Mixing fuels, with different autoignition properties, can lower the combustion speed.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n | last = Mack\n | first = J. Hunter\n | author2 = Daniel L. Flowers\n | author3 = Bruce A.

These engines can withstand a boost in power because the heat release rate in these engines is slow. However, in HCCI engines increasing the fuel/air ratio results in higher peak pressures and heat release rates. In addition, many viable HCCI control strategies require thermal preheating of the fuel, which reduces the density and hence the mass of the air/fuel charge in the combustion chamber, reducing power. These factors make increasing the power in HCCI engines challenging.\n\nOne technique is to use fuels with different [[autoignition]] properties. This lowers the heat release rate and peak pressures and makes it possible to increase the equivalence ratio. Another way is to thermally stratify the charge so that different points in the compressed charge have different temperatures and burn at different times, lowering the heat release rate and making it possible to increase power.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n | last = Sjoberg\n | first = Magnus\n | author2 = John E.

This low peak temperature reduces the formation of {{chem|NO|x}}, but it also leads to incomplete burning of fuel, especially near combustion chamber walls. This produces relatively high carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions. An oxidizing catalyst can remove the regulated species, because the exhaust is still oxygen-rich.\n\n=== Difference from knock ===\n\nEngine knock or pinging occurs when some of the unburnt gases ahead of the flame in an SI engine spontaneously ignite. This gas is compressed as the flame propagates and the pressure in the combustion chamber rises. The high pressure and corresponding high temperature of unburnt reactants can cause them to spontaneously ignite. This causes a shock wave to traverse from the end gas region and an expansion wave to traverse into the end gas region. The two waves reflect off the boundaries of the combustion chamber and interact to produce high amplitude [[standing waves]], thus forming a primitive thermoacoustic device where the resonance is amplified by the increased heat release during the wave travel similar to a [[Rijke tube]].\n\nA similar ignition process occurs in HCCI. However, rather than part of the reactant mixture igniting by compression ahead of a flame front, ignition in HCCI engines occurs due to piston compression more or less simultaneously in the bulk of the compressed charge. Little or no pressure differences occur between the different regions of the gas, eliminating any shock wave and knocking, but the rapid pressure rise is still present and desirable from the point of seeking maximum efficiency from near-ideal isochoric heat addition.\n\n=== Simulation of HCCI Engines ===\n\nComputational models for simulating combustion and heat release rates of HCCI engines require detailed chemistry models.<ref name=\"cmcl1\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www-pls.llnl.gov/?url=science_and_technology-chemistry-combustion |title=Combustion Chemistry |publisher=Pls.llnl.gov |accessdate=2014-03-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140817184821/https://www-pls.llnl.gov/?url=science_and_technology-chemistry-combustion |archivedate=2014-08-17 }}<br/>http://www.cmclinnovations.com/?page_id=67</ref> This is largely because ignition is more sensitive to chemical kinetics than to turbulence/spray or spark processes as are typical in SI and diesel engines.

As in other forms of [[combustion]], this [[exothermic reaction]] releases energy that can be transformed in an engine into [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] and heat.\n\nHCCI combines characteristics of conventional [[gasoline engine]] and [[diesel engine]]s. Gasoline engines combine ''homogeneous charge''  (HC) with ''[[spark ignition]]'' (SI), abbreviated as HCSI. Modern direct injection diesel engines combine ''[[stratified charge]]'' (SC) with ''[[compression ignition]]'' (CI), abbreviated as SCCI.\n\nAs in HCSI, HCCI injects fuel during the intake stroke. However, rather than using an electric discharge (spark) to ignite a portion of the mixture, HCCI raises density and temperature by compression until the entire mixture reacts spontaneously.\n\nStratified charge compression ignition also relies on temperature and density increase resulting from compression. However, it injects fuel later, during the compression stroke. Combustion occurs at the boundary of the fuel and air, producing higher emissions, but allowing a [[Lean burn|leaner]] and higher temperature compression burn, producing greater efficiency.\n\n[[control theory|Controlling]] HCCI requires microprocessor control and physical understanding of the ignition process. HCCI designs achieve gasoline engine-like emissions with diesel engine-like efficiency.\n\nHCCI engines achieve extremely low levels of [[Nitrogen oxide|oxides of nitrogen]] emissions ({{chem|NO|x}}) without a [[catalytic converter]]. Hydrocarbons (unburnt fuels and oils) and carbon monoxide emissions still require  treatment to meet [[automobile emissions control]] regulations.\n\nRecent research has shown that the hybrid fuels combining different reactivities (such as gasoline and diesel) can help in controlling HCCI ignition and burn rates. RCCI, or [[reactivity controlled compression ignition]], has been demonstrated to provide highly efficient, low emissions operation over wide load and speed ranges.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.engr.wisc.edu/news/headlines/2009/Aug03.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225044550/http://www.engr.wisc.edu/news/headlines/2009/Aug03.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2010-02-25 |title=College of Engineering @ The University of Wisconsin-Madison, initiatives in energy, health, nanotechnology, security, and information technology |publisher=Engr.wisc.edu |accessdate=2014-03-31 }}</ref>.\n\n== History ==\n\nHCCI engines have a long history, even though HCCI has not been as widely implemented as spark ignition or diesel injection.

One example is the [[Hot bulb engine|hot-bulb engine]] which used a hot vaporization chamber to help mix fuel with air. The extra heat combined with compression induced the conditions for combustion. Another example is the [[Carbureted compression ignition model engine|\"diesel\" model aircraft engine]].\n\n== Operation ==\n\n=== Methods ===\n\nA mixture of fuel and air ignites when the concentration and temperature of reactants is sufficiently high. The concentration and/or temperature can be increased in several different ways:\n\n* Increasing compression ratio\n* Pre-heating of induction gases\n* Forced induction\n* Retained or re-inducted exhaust gases\n\nOnce ignited, combustion occurs very quickly. When auto-ignition occurs too early or with too much chemical energy, combustion is too fast and high in-cylinder pressures can destroy an engine. For this reason, HCCI is typically operated at lean overall fuel mixtures.\n\n=== Advantages ===\n\n* Since HCCI engines are fuel-lean, they can operate at diesel-like compression ratios (>15), thus achieving 30% higher efficiencies than conventional SI gasoline engines.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | first1 = Fuquan\n | last1  = Zhao\n | first2 = Thomas W.\n | last2  = Asmus\n | first3 = Dennis N.\n | last3  = Assanis\n | first4 = John E.\n | last4  = Dec\n | first5 = James A.\n | last5  = Eng\n | first6 = Paul M.\n | last6  = Najt\n | title = Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) Engines: Key Research and Development Issues\n | publisher = [[Society of Automotive Engineers]]\n | location = Warrendale, PA, USA\n | year = 2003\n | pages = 11\u201312\n | isbn = 0-7680-1123-X }}\n</ref>\n* Homogeneous mixing of fuel and air leads to cleaner combustion and lower emissions.

In a typical [[gasoline engine]], a spark is used to ignite the pre-mixed fuel and air. In [[Diesel engines]], combustion begins when the fuel is injected into pre-compressed air. In both cases, combustion timing is explicitly controlled. In an HCCI engine, however, the homogeneous mixture of fuel and air is compressed and combustion begins whenever sufficient pressure and temperature are reached. This means that no well-defined combustion initiator provides direct control. Engines must be designed so that ignition conditions occur at the desired timing. To achieve dynamic operation, the [[control system]] must manage the conditions that induce combustion. Options include the compression ratio, inducted gas temperature, inducted gas pressure, fuel-air ratio, or quantity of retained or re-inducted exhaust. Several control approaches are discussed below.\n\n==== Compression ratio ====\n\nTwo compression ratios are significant. The ''[[geometric compression ratio]]'' can be changed with a movable plunger at the top of the [[cylinder head]]. This system is used in diesel [[Model engine|model aircraft engines]]. The ''[[effective compression ratio]]'' can be reduced from the geometric ratio by closing the intake valve either very late or very early with [[variable valve actuation]] ([[variable valve timing]] that enables the [[Miller cycle]]). Both approaches require energy to achieve fast response. Additionally, implementation is expensive, but is effective.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | first1 = Goran | last1  = Haraldsson\n | first2 = Jari | last2  = Hyvonen\n | first3 = Per | last3  = Tunestal\n | first4 = Bengt | last4  = Johansson\n | year = 2002\n | title = SAE Technical Paper 2002-01-2858\n | volume = <!-- -->\n | chapter = HCCI Combustion Phasing in a Multi Cylinder Engine Using Variable Compression Ratio\n | series = SAE Technical Paper Series\n | doi = 10.4271/2002-01-2858\n}}</ref> The effect of compression ratio on HCCI combustion has also been studied extensively.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n | last1 = Aceves | first1 = S.

The simplest temperature control method uses resistance heaters to vary the inlet temperature, but this approach is too slow to change on a cycle-to-cycle frequency.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n | last = Flowers\n | first = Daniel L.\n | author2 = S.

The exhaust has dual effects on HCCI combustion. It dilutes the fresh charge, delaying ignition and reducing the chemical energy and engine output. Hot combustion products conversely increase gas temperature in the cylinder and advance ignition. Control of combustion timing HCCI engines using EGR has been shown experimentally.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n | first1 = Michael\n | last1  = Au\n | first2 = J.

VVA can achieve this via either:\n\n* Controlling the effective compression ratio: VVA on intake can control the point at which the intake valve closes. Retarding past bottom dead center (BDC), changes the compression ratio, altering the in-cylinder pressure-time envelope.\n* Controlling the amount of hot exhaust gas retained in the combustion chamber: VVA can control the amount of hot EGR within the combustion chamber, either by valve re-opening or changes in valve overlap. Balancing the percentage of cooled external EGR with the hot internal EGR generated by a VVA system, makes it possible to control the in-cylinder temperature.\n\nWhile electro-hydraulic and camless VVA systems offer control over the valve event, the componentry for such systems is currently complicated and expensive. Mechanical variable lift and duration systems, however, although more complex than a standard valvetrain, are cheaper and less complicated. It is relatively simple to configure such systems to achieve the necessary control over the valve lift curve.\n\n==== Fuel mixture ====\n\nAnother means to extend the operating range is to control the onset of ignition and the heat release rate<ref>[http://www.cmclinnovations.com/userstories/userstory1.html Controlling Heat Release Using Advanced Fuels] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405164105/http://www.cmclinnovations.com/userstories/userstory1.html |date=2011-04-05 }}</ref><ref>\n{{cite journal\n | last = Smallbone\n | first = Andrew\n | author2 = Amit Bhave\n | author3 = Neal M.

Ignition timing varies with the ratio of these fuels.\n* In-chamber blending: One fuel can be injected in the intake duct (port injection) and the other directly into the cylinder.\n\n==== Direct Injection: PCCI or PPCI Combustion ====\n\nCompression Ignition Direct Injection (CIDI) combustion is a well-established means of controlling ignition timing and heat release rate and is adopted in [[diesel engine]] combustion. [[Partially premixed combustion|Partially Pre-mixed Charge Compression Ignition]] (PPCI) also known as Premixed Charge Compression Ignition (PCCI) is a compromise offering the control of CIDI combustion with the reduced exhaust gas emissions of HCCI, specifically lower [[soot]].<ref name=\"Kal\">{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1115/1.4000602|title = Low NOx and Low Smoke Operation of a Diesel Engine Using Gasolinelike Fuels|journal = Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power|volume = 132|issue = 9|year = 2010|last1 = Kalghatgi|first1 = Gautam|last2 = Hildingsson|first2 = Leif|last3 = Johansson|first3 = Bengt}}</ref> The heat release rate is controlled by preparing the combustible mixture in such a way that combustion occurs over a longer time duration making it less prone to [[engine knocking|knocking]]. This is done by timing the injection event such that a range of air/fuel ratios spread across the combustion cylinder when ignition begins. Ignition occurs in different regions of the combustion chamber at different times - slowing the heat release rate. This mixture is designed to minimize the number of fuel-rich pockets, reducing soot formation.<ref name=\"cmcl2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cmclinnovations.com/userstories/userstory2.html |title=Partially-Premixed Compression Ignition (PPCI) and Low-Temperature Combustion (LTC) modes |website=Cmcl |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309041652/http://www.cmclinnovations.com/userstories/userstory2.html |archive-date=2012-03-09 |url-status=dead |access-date=2016-04-06 |quote=One promising approach is that of Partially-Premixed Compression Ignition (PPCI) or Low Temperature Combustion (LTC) mode.

Hence at any point in time, only a fraction of the total fuel is burning. This results in low peak pressures and low energy release rates. In HCCI however, the entire fuel/air mixture ignites and burns over a much smaller time interval, resulting in high peak pressures and high energy release rates. To withstand the higher pressures, the engine has to be structurally stronger. Several strategies have been proposed to lower the rate of combustion and peak pressure. Mixing fuels, with different autoignition properties, can lower the combustion speed.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n | last = Mack\n | first = J. Hunter\n | author2 = Daniel L. Flowers\n | author3 = Bruce A.

These engines can withstand a boost in power because the heat release rate in these engines is slow. However, in HCCI engines increasing the fuel/air ratio results in higher peak pressures and heat release rates. In addition, many viable HCCI control strategies require thermal preheating of the fuel, which reduces the density and hence the mass of the air/fuel charge in the combustion chamber, reducing power. These factors make increasing the power in HCCI engines challenging.\n\nOne technique is to use fuels with different [[autoignition]] properties. This lowers the heat release rate and peak pressures and makes it possible to increase the equivalence ratio. Another way is to thermally stratify the charge so that different points in the compressed charge have different temperatures and burn at different times, lowering the heat release rate and making it possible to increase power.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n | last = Sjoberg\n | first = Magnus\n | author2 = John E.

This low peak temperature reduces the formation of {{chem|NO|x}}, but it also leads to incomplete burning of fuel, especially near combustion chamber walls. This produces relatively high carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions. An oxidizing catalyst can remove the regulated species, because the exhaust is still oxygen-rich.\n\n=== Difference from knock ===\n\nEngine knock or pinging occurs when some of the unburnt gases ahead of the flame in an SI engine spontaneously ignite. This gas is compressed as the flame propagates and the pressure in the combustion chamber rises. The high pressure and corresponding high temperature of unburnt reactants can cause them to spontaneously ignite. This causes a shock wave to traverse from the end gas region and an expansion wave to traverse into the end gas region. The two waves reflect off the boundaries of the combustion chamber and interact to produce high amplitude [[standing waves]], thus forming a primitive thermoacoustic device where the resonance is amplified by the increased heat release during the wave travel similar to a [[Rijke tube]].\n\nA similar ignition process occurs in HCCI. However, rather than part of the reactant mixture igniting by compression ahead of a flame front, ignition in HCCI engines occurs due to piston compression more or less simultaneously in the bulk of the compressed charge. Little or no pressure differences occur between the different regions of the gas, eliminating any shock wave and knocking, but the rapid pressure rise is still present and desirable from the point of seeking maximum efficiency from near-ideal isochoric heat addition.\n\n=== Simulation of HCCI Engines ===\n\nComputational models for simulating combustion and heat release rates of HCCI engines require detailed chemistry models.<ref name=\"cmcl1\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www-pls.llnl.gov/?url=science_and_technology-chemistry-combustion |title=Combustion Chemistry |publisher=Pls.llnl.gov |accessdate=2014-03-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140817184821/https://www-pls.llnl.gov/?url=science_and_technology-chemistry-combustion |archivedate=2014-08-17 }}<br/>http://www.cmclinnovations.com/?page_id=67</ref> This is largely because ignition is more sensitive to chemical kinetics than to turbulence/spray or spark processes as are typical in SI and diesel engines.

Many of those men were at [[Normandy]] on [[D-Day]].\n\nIn the 1940s, Morro Bay developed an [[abalone]] fishing industry; it peaked in 1957, and stocks of abalone have declined significantly due to overfishing.<ref>Susan McBride and Fred F.

The plant was built in the 1950s, and Dynegy had hoped to modernize it with a new [[combined cycle]] plant. The plant was operating at relatively low capacity factors (approximately 5%) under contract with PG&E, due primarily to economics. The plant was staffed with 44 employees. A portion of the city's budget came from taxes on the [[natural gas]] the plant burned. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) and the courts are wrestling with how to interpret the [[Clean Water Act]] (CWA) and its applicability to power plants. The EPA has ruled that the local Regional Water Quality Control Boards are responsible for ensuring that the current and the future plant are permitted and regulated.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe modernization proposal was rejected, and the plant closed in February 2014. Continued operation would have required expensive upgrades by 2015. The 650-[[megawatt]] plant operated around the clock during the energy crisis of 2000, but the plant had been operating at just one-sixth of that capacity in the recent years preceding its closure.<ref>[http://www.sanluisobispo.com/2014/02/05/2910352/dynegy-officially-closes-morro.html Dynegy officially closes the Morro Bay Power Plant] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140722134018/http://www.sanluisobispo.com/2014/02/05/2910352/dynegy-officially-closes-morro.html |date=July 22, 2014 }}, San Luis Obispo Tribune, February 5, 2014</ref> Future uses of the site and/or plant are undetermined, as of December 2016.\n\nIn 2018, a joint venture of German energy company EnBW and Seattle-based Trident Winds announced its plan to obtain the power plant's grid connection to connect a 650 MW floating [[Offshore wind power|offshore wind park]] comprising up to 100 floating wind turbines and a floating substation situated some 30 miles off the coast.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.offshorewind.biz/2018/06/11/enbw-dives-deep-into-us-offshore-wind/|title=EnBW Dives Deep Into US Offshore Wind|date=2018-06-11|website=Offshore Wind|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-26}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:BlackHillMorroBayPanorama.jpg|thumb|center|750px|A panoramic view of Morro Bay (near side of sandspit), [[Estero Bay (California)|Estero bay]] (far side of sandspit), Los Osos, Baywood Park, Chorro Valley, and Hollister Peak, from Black Hill]]\n[[File:Islands in Morro Bay, California.png|thumb|Several low-lying islands (Unit Island and [[Wednesday Island (California)]] visible) are present in the southern portion of Morro Bay]]\n\nMorro Bay is the name of the large estuary that is situated along the northern shores of the bay itself.

It is the only all-weather small craft commercial and recreational harbor between [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] and [[Monterey, California|Monterey]]. Morro Rock was originally surrounded by water, but the Army built a large artificial [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwater]] and road across the north end of the harbor, linking Morro Rock and the mainland. Some of the rock used for this and for the artificial breakwaters was quarried from Morro Rock itself. Other rock was imported by barge from [[Santa Catalina Island, California|Catalina Island]]. The bay extends inland and parallels the shore for a distance of about 6.4&nbsp;km (4 miles) south of its entrance at Morro Rock. Morro Bay is recognized for protection by the [[California Bays and Estuaries Policy]].<ref name=\"swrcb\">State Water Resources Control Board ''Water Quality Control Policy for the Enclosed Bays and Estuaries of California'' (1974) State of California</ref>\n\nOnly relatively small craft are capable of passing the harbor channel. A large natural [[spit (landform)|sandspit]], augmented by breakwaters, protects the harbor from the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the west. At its northern end, remains of a bridge that used to connect the shore with the sandspit can be seen. Morro Bay Harbor's channel silts up and must be [[dredging|dredged]] every three to four years. Previously, the Shark Inlet connected the back bay to the ocean. Some have proposed reopening it to slow the sedimentation that is filling up the bay. There has also been work on reducing [[erosion]] in the Chorro Creek [[drainage basin|watershed]] to reduce the amount of sediment coming into the bay to form bottom layers of [[bay mud]]. Chorro Creek is the bay's largest tributary. It forms an estuary in the back bay between Morro Bay and Los Osos. The second largest tributary, and the only other significant one, is Los Osos Creek, which empties into the far south end of the back bay.\n\nThe [[United States Coast Guard]] regards the harbor as one of the most dangerous in the entire nation, while others put it in the top six on the [[West Coast of the United States]]. In 1995, the Army Corps of Engineering deepened and expanded the channel to improve safety. From 1979 to 1987, 21 lives were lost in boating accidents alone. Mariners are strongly urged to seek local advice prior to making use of the channel, especially when whitecaps or wind-blown water is evident or a [[small craft advisory]] is in effect.  Deaths have resulted from sightseers and fisherman being swept off the rocks of the breakwater surrounding Morro Rock. They often approach too closely to the waves and are caught off guard when a big wave set comes in. The slippery and jagged rocks only add to the danger. Public access to the breakwater has been revoked and those who venture beyond the signs do so at their own peril.\n\nCoast Guard Station Morro Bay operates three [[47-foot Motor Lifeboat]]s. Limited transient vessel services are available. Yachtsmen may wish to contact the Morro Bay Yacht Club. A public boat launch ramp is available at the far south end of the Embarcadero.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Morro Bay Docks.jpg|Tiny Morro Bay harbor\nFile:Morro Bay California seagulls.jpg|A flock of [[western gull]]s in Morro Bay, California\nFile:A newborn baby Sea Otter, Enhydra lutris, Morro Bay.jpg|A newborn [[Enhydra lutris|sea otter]] in Morro Bay, just offshore from Morro Rock.

However, there is some slightly deeper water in the channels. The largest channel continues from the bay's main channel, winding its way towards [[Los Osos, California|Los Osos]], on the southern end of the bay. The second largest breaks off from the largest about halfway to Los Osos and takes an extremely windy route to the sandspit. A few small channels on the landward side formed by runoff meet the largest channel as well. The narrow, unmarked channels are very hard to navigate and are filled with [[zostera|eel grass]], which can snag the [[boat]] or clog the [[propeller]]. They are easiest to find at low tide, but if the tide is too low, the boat may run aground because the channels are only a few feet deeper than the surrounding water. An alternative to searching for the channels is to cross at very high tide.\n\n===Marine Protected Areas===\n[[Morro Bay State Marine Recreational Management Area and Morro Bay State Marine Reserve]] are marine protected areas offshore from Morro Bay. Like underwater parks, these marine protected areas help conserve ocean wildlife and marine ecosystems.\n[[File:Morro Bay, CA, jjron 23.03.2012.jpg|thumb|center|800px|A panoramic view of [[Estero Bay (California)|Estero bay]], with the town of [[Cayucos]] on the left, Morro Bay/Morro Rock center, and [[Point Buchon]]/[[Montana de Oro]] State Park on the right]]\n\n===Climate===\nMorro Bay experiences a mild [[Mediterranean climate#warm-summer Mediterranean climate|warm-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Csb'') characteristic of coastal California featuring dry, warm summers and wet, mild winters. The city is located next to the [[Pacific Ocean]], which helps moderate temperatures and create an overall pleasant mild year-round climate, resulting in warmer winters and cooler summers compared with places farther inland, such as [[Atascadero, California|Atascadero]]. Summers in Morro Bay are cool for a city located on the [[35th parallel north]] latitude, with July averaging around {{convert|60|\u00b0F}}.

The plant was built in the 1950s, and Dynegy had hoped to modernize it with a new [[combined cycle]] plant. The plant was operating at relatively low capacity factors (approximately 5%) under contract with PG&E, due primarily to economics. The plant was staffed with 44 employees. A portion of the city's budget came from taxes on the [[natural gas]] the plant burned. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) and the courts are wrestling with how to interpret the [[Clean Water Act]] (CWA) and its applicability to power plants. The EPA has ruled that the local Regional Water Quality Control Boards are responsible for ensuring that the current and the future plant are permitted and regulated.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe modernization proposal was rejected, and the plant closed in February 2014. Continued operation would have required expensive upgrades by 2015. The 650-[[megawatt]] plant operated around the clock during the energy crisis of 2000, but the plant had been operating at just one-sixth of that capacity in the recent years preceding its closure.<ref>[http://www.sanluisobispo.com/2014/02/05/2910352/dynegy-officially-closes-morro.html Dynegy officially closes the Morro Bay Power Plant] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140722134018/http://www.sanluisobispo.com/2014/02/05/2910352/dynegy-officially-closes-morro.html |date=July 22, 2014 }}, San Luis Obispo Tribune, February 5, 2014</ref> Future uses of the site and/or plant are undetermined, as of December 2016.\n\nIn 2018, a joint venture of German energy company EnBW and Seattle-based Trident Winds announced its plan to obtain the power plant's grid connection to connect a 650 MW floating [[Offshore wind power|offshore wind park]] comprising up to 100 floating wind turbines and a floating substation situated some 30 miles off the coast.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.offshorewind.biz/2018/06/11/enbw-dives-deep-into-us-offshore-wind/|title=EnBW Dives Deep Into US Offshore Wind|date=2018-06-11|website=Offshore Wind|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-26}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:BlackHillMorroBayPanorama.jpg|thumb|center|750px|A panoramic view of Morro Bay (near side of sandspit), [[Estero Bay (California)|Estero bay]] (far side of sandspit), Los Osos, Baywood Park, Chorro Valley, and Hollister Peak, from Black Hill]]\n[[File:Islands in Morro Bay, California.png|thumb|Several low-lying islands (Unit Island and [[Wednesday Island (California)]] visible) are present in the southern portion of Morro Bay]]\n\nMorro Bay is the name of the large estuary that is situated along the northern shores of the bay itself.

It is the only all-weather small craft commercial and recreational harbor between [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] and [[Monterey, California|Monterey]]. Morro Rock was originally surrounded by water, but the Army built a large artificial [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwater]] and road across the north end of the harbor, linking Morro Rock and the mainland. Some of the rock used for this and for the artificial breakwaters was quarried from Morro Rock itself. Other rock was imported by barge from [[Santa Catalina Island, California|Catalina Island]]. The bay extends inland and parallels the shore for a distance of about 6.4&nbsp;km (4 miles) south of its entrance at Morro Rock. Morro Bay is recognized for protection by the [[California Bays and Estuaries Policy]].<ref name=\"swrcb\">State Water Resources Control Board ''Water Quality Control Policy for the Enclosed Bays and Estuaries of California'' (1974) State of California</ref>\n\nOnly relatively small craft are capable of passing the harbor channel. A large natural [[spit (landform)|sandspit]], augmented by breakwaters, protects the harbor from the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the west. At its northern end, remains of a bridge that used to connect the shore with the sandspit can be seen. Morro Bay Harbor's channel silts up and must be [[dredging|dredged]] every three to four years. Previously, the Shark Inlet connected the back bay to the ocean. Some have proposed reopening it to slow the sedimentation that is filling up the bay. There has also been work on reducing [[erosion]] in the Chorro Creek [[drainage basin|watershed]] to reduce the amount of sediment coming into the bay to form bottom layers of [[bay mud]]. Chorro Creek is the bay's largest tributary. It forms an estuary in the back bay between Morro Bay and Los Osos. The second largest tributary, and the only other significant one, is Los Osos Creek, which empties into the far south end of the back bay.\n\nThe [[United States Coast Guard]] regards the harbor as one of the most dangerous in the entire nation, while others put it in the top six on the [[West Coast of the United States]]. In 1995, the Army Corps of Engineering deepened and expanded the channel to improve safety. From 1979 to 1987, 21 lives were lost in boating accidents alone. Mariners are strongly urged to seek local advice prior to making use of the channel, especially when whitecaps or wind-blown water is evident or a [[small craft advisory]] is in effect.  Deaths have resulted from sightseers and fisherman being swept off the rocks of the breakwater surrounding Morro Rock. They often approach too closely to the waves and are caught off guard when a big wave set comes in. The slippery and jagged rocks only add to the danger. Public access to the breakwater has been revoked and those who venture beyond the signs do so at their own peril.\n\nCoast Guard Station Morro Bay operates three [[47-foot Motor Lifeboat]]s. Limited transient vessel services are available. Yachtsmen may wish to contact the Morro Bay Yacht Club. A public boat launch ramp is available at the far south end of the Embarcadero.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Morro Bay Docks.jpg|Tiny Morro Bay harbor\nFile:Morro Bay California seagulls.jpg|A flock of [[western gull]]s in Morro Bay, California\nFile:A newborn baby Sea Otter, Enhydra lutris, Morro Bay.jpg|A newborn [[Enhydra lutris|sea otter]] in Morro Bay, just offshore from Morro Rock.

However, there is some slightly deeper water in the channels. The largest channel continues from the bay's main channel, winding its way towards [[Los Osos, California|Los Osos]], on the southern end of the bay. The second largest breaks off from the largest about halfway to Los Osos and takes an extremely windy route to the sandspit. A few small channels on the landward side formed by runoff meet the largest channel as well. The narrow, unmarked channels are very hard to navigate and are filled with [[zostera|eel grass]], which can snag the [[boat]] or clog the [[propeller]]. They are easiest to find at low tide, but if the tide is too low, the boat may run aground because the channels are only a few feet deeper than the surrounding water. An alternative to searching for the channels is to cross at very high tide.\n\n===Marine Protected Areas===\n[[Morro Bay State Marine Recreational Management Area and Morro Bay State Marine Reserve]] are marine protected areas offshore from Morro Bay. Like underwater parks, these marine protected areas help conserve ocean wildlife and marine ecosystems.\n[[File:Morro Bay, CA, jjron 23.03.2012.jpg|thumb|center|800px|A panoramic view of [[Estero Bay (California)|Estero bay]], with the town of [[Cayucos]] on the left, Morro Bay/Morro Rock center, and [[Point Buchon]]/[[Montana de Oro]] State Park on the right]]\n\n===Climate===\nMorro Bay experiences a mild [[Mediterranean climate#warm-summer Mediterranean climate|warm-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Csb'') characteristic of coastal California featuring dry, warm summers and wet, mild winters. The city is located next to the [[Pacific Ocean]], which helps moderate temperatures and create an overall pleasant mild year-round climate, resulting in warmer winters and cooler summers compared with places farther inland, such as [[Atascadero, California|Atascadero]]. Summers in Morro Bay are cool for a city located on the [[35th parallel north]] latitude, with July averaging around {{convert|60|\u00b0F}}.

The formal name of the airport is still '''Copenhagen Airport, Kastrup''', to distinguish it from [[Roskilde Airport]], whose formal name is ''Copenhagen Airport, Roskilde''.\n\n==History==\nThe airport was inaugurated 20 April 1925 and was one of the first civil airports in the world. It consisted of a large, impressive terminal built of wood, a couple of hangars, a balloon mast, a hydroplane landing stage and a few grassy meadows that could be used as runways. The grass on the runways was kept short by sheep, which were shepherded away before take-offs and landings. From 1932 to 1939, takeoffs and landings increased from 6,000 to 50,000 and passenger number increased to 72,000. Between 1936 and 1939, a new terminal was built, considered one of the finest examples of [[Functionalism (architecture)#Nordic \"funkis\"|Nordic functionalism]]. The terminal was designed by [[Vilhelm Lauritzen]], who was considered a pioneer among architects, in terms not only of architecture and construction, but also of service and passenger comfort.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cph.dk/en/about-cph/profile/History/The-pioneer-era/|title=The pioneer era|accessdate=10 May 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402114836/http://www.cph.dk/en/about-cph/profile/History/The-pioneer-era/|archivedate=2 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the years of [[World War II]], the Copenhagen airport was closed for civil operations except for periodic flights to destinations in [[Sweden]], [[Germany]], and [[Austria]]. In the summer of 1941 the first hard-surface runway opened. It was {{convert|1400|m}} long and {{convert|65|m}} wide. When [[World War II]] ended in May 1945, Copenhagen had the most modern international airport in [[Europe]], because the airport remained untouched by actual acts of war.\n\nOn 1 August 1947, [[Scandinavian Airlines]] (SAS) was founded, an important event for the Copenhagen Airport, as Copenhagen was to be the main hub for the airline. Traffic increased rapidly in the first years SAS operated. On 26 January 1947, a [[KLM]] Douglas DC-3 \"Dakota\" [[1947 KLM Douglas DC-3 Copenhagen accident|crashed]] at the airport after stopping en route to [[Stockholm]]. 22 people on board died, including the Swedish prince [[Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of V\u00e4sterbotten|Gustav Adolf]] and the American opera singer [[Grace Moore]]. In 1948 Copenhagen airport was third largest airport in Europe with 150 daily takeoffs and almost 300,000 passengers for the year. The airport continued its rapid growth. The terminal was expanded several times and new hangars were erected.\n\nIn 1954, Scandinavian Airlines begins the world's first trans-polar route, flying initially to [[Los Angeles]]. The route proved to be a publicity coup, and for some years Copenhagen became a popular transit point for Hollywood stars and producers flying to Europe \u2013 also the airport handled 11,000 tonnes of freight per year. In 1956, the airport handled 1 million passengers per year and won the award{{clarify|date=April 2015|reason=which award?}} for the world's best airport. The runways were lengthened and fitted with technically advanced equipment.\n\n[[File:Kastrup Airport (12).jpg|thumb|Kastrup Airport in the 1960s.]]\nBy 10 May 1960, when the new airport terminal (now Terminal 2) was inaugurated, the daily number of jet operations had increased to 28, and still traffic kept on growing. The large new airport terminal soon became too small, and in 1969 yet another huge expansion programme was launched. Domestic traffic was relocated to a new domestic terminal (the eastern part of Terminal 1). The (current) international terminal was supplemented with a new pier (C) and a separate arrivals hall (the building between Terminals 2 and 3). A new control tower and {{convert|3600|m}} of additional runways allowed take-offs and landings to take place at the same time. When the comprehensive expansion was completed in 1972, the number of take-offs and landings exceeded 180,000 and there were more than eight million passengers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cph.dk/en/about-cph/profile/History/Interkontinental-1940-1972/|title=Interkontinental 1940\u20131972|accessdate=10 May 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518091030/http://www.cph.dk/en/about-cph/profile/History/Interkontinental-1940-1972/|archivedate=18 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1970s, airport traffic continued to grow, but the airport was not expanded further. A new large airport located at the island of [[Saltholm]] (with a connecting bridge to [[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]]) was on the drawing board. It would be a huge investment, and the proposal was evaluated thoroughly by many experts. In 1980, however, the Danish parliament instead decided to expand the capacity of Copenhagen airport to 20\u201322 million passengers by the year 2000. This solution was far cheaper than building a new airport and because the new types of aircraft were less noisy, an airport on Saltholm did not offer a decisive environmental gain. In 1973 the airport handled 8 million passengers per year. The third (long) runway opened and the dual runway system (04L/22R-04R/22L) opened, strongly expanding the starts and landings capacity.\n\nThe expansion of the airport began in 1982, after the necessary period of planning. The intention was not to build Europe's largest airport, but to build transit passengers' favourite airport. A stay at the airport was supposed to be an integral part of the travel experience. Efficiency and precision were obvious demands, but focus was also on generating an oasis where international travellers could relax: beautiful architecture, Scandinavian design, and pleasant, light, and comfortable surroundings with plenty of shops, restaurants, and other facilities providing enjoyment and pleasure. The new cargo terminal was built in the eastern area of the airport.\n\nA number of important construction projects were completed in 1998: a pier connecting the domestic and international terminals; a new arrivals hall; new modern baggage handling facilities; an underground railway station with two large underground parking facilities with 2400 spaces opens; and above it all the spacious and impressive delta-shaped terminal (Terminal 3) with 17 million passengers capacity. The first stage of the new Pier D was completed in the spring of 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cph.dk/en/about-cph/profile/History/Hub-1973-1999/|title=Hub 1973\u20131999|accessdate=10 May 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103000938/http://www.cph.dk/en/about-cph/profile/History/Hub-1973-1999/|archivedate=3 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn 1 July 2000 the [[\u00d8resund Bridge]] opened which connects Denmark and Sweden by motorway and train. In 2001 the five-star [[Hilton Worldwide|Hilton]] hotel opened with 382 rooms. In 2006 for the first time in its history Copenhagen airport exceeded 20 million passengers and reached 20,900,000 passengers. In October 2007 the metro station opened, connecting the airport to the [[Copenhagen Metro]]. A new control tower opened in 2008 by [[Naviair]] as part of a major renovation of the ATC system. Airport officials announced plans to build a new low-cost terminal at the facility.

An all new Terminal 4 has been discussed, but replaced by plans to expand the current facilities in appropriate increments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cph.dk/om-cph/profil/expandingcph/|title=Expanding CPH|accessdate=10 May 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502044934/http://www.cph.dk/om-cph/profil/expandingcph/|archivedate=2 May 2015}}</ref> Copenhagen Airport says passengers have easy transfer possibilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cph.dk/for-rejsen/transferpassagerer/|title=Transferpassagerer|accessdate=10 May 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150425152241/http://www.cph.dk/for-rejsen/transferpassagerer|archivedate=25 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nPreviously all domestic flights departed from Terminal 1, but from 29 March 2015 all departures have been collected in Terminals 2 and 3,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cph.dk/om-cph/presse/nyheder/bedre-forhold-for-indenrigs/|title=Bedre forhold for indenrigs|accessdate=10 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402144038/http://www.cph.dk/om-cph/presse/nyheder/bedre-forhold-for-indenrigs/|archive-date=2 April 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cph.dk/om-cph/presse/nyheder/central-placering-af-indenrigs-i-cph/|title=Central placering af Indenrigs i CPH|accessdate=10 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524103351/http://www.cph.dk/om-cph/presse/nyheder/central-placering-af-indenrigs-i-cph|archive-date=24 May 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> and Pier C was expanded with another jetbridge at DKK 10M to facilitate the Emirates [[Airbus A380]] to Dubai from December 2015,<ref name=\"cph2015-04\">\"[http://www.cph.dk/en/about-cph/press/news/emirates-a380/ Emirates to deploy the world's biggest aircraft on its Copenhagen service] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409075803/https://www.cph.dk/en/about-cph/press/news/emirates-a380/ |date=9 April 2016 }}\" ''CPH press'', 9 April 2015.</ref><ref name=\"ci2015-04\">\"[http://www.check-in.dk/-cph-a380-er-en-milepael-for-os CPH: A380 er en milep\u00e6l for os] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017045742/http://www.check-in.dk/-cph-a380-er-en-milepael-for-os |date=17 October 2015 }}\" ''Check-in.dk'', 10 April 2015.</ref> which was the first 2-class A380 carrying 615 passengers.<ref name=cpA380/><ref>\"[http://www.check-in.dk/verdenspremiere-i-cph-paa-615-saeders-fly Verdenspremiere i CPH p\u00e5 615-s\u00e6ders fly]\" ''Check-in.dk'', 10 April 2015.</ref>\n\nA new pier, to be called Pier E, is under construction and will be fully finished in 2020.<ref>[https://www.cph.dk/en/about-cph/press/news/2017/1/cph-two-construction-projects-with-a-price-tag-of-dkk-1.2-billion-to-create-additional-capacity-for-passengers-and-aircraft CPH: Two construction projects with a price tag of DKK 1.2 billion to create additional capacity for passengers and aircrafts &#91;sic&#93;]</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"nolines\">\nFile:Cph airport letters.jpg|Welcome sign\nFile:Copenhagen Airport Mai 2009 PD 105.JPG|Check-in desks at Terminal 2\nFile:Copenhagen Airport Mai 2009 PD 086.JPG|Exterior of Terminal 3\nFile:Baggage Claim at CPH.jpg|Baggage claim inside Terminal 3\n</gallery>\n\n===Runways===\nDespite the short distance to the city centre, approaches to, and departures from, the airport are above water due to the heading of the dual parallel runway system (04R/22L & 04L/22R). Those runways point to the [[\u00d8resund]] strait, close in both directions. The supplementary runway (30/12) oriented perpendicular to the main runways also has its approach or departure over \u00d8resund in one direction. In the opposite direction, the 30/12 runway has noise restrictions as flight happens close over residential areas.<ref>Rasmussen, Thyge. \"[http://www.dmi.dk/nyheder/arkiv/nyheder-2015/04/flytrafik-som-vinden-blaeser/ Flytrafik som vinden bl\u00e6ser] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419100959/http://www.dmi.dk/nyheder/arkiv/nyheder-2015/04/flytrafik-som-vinden-blaeser/ |date=19 April 2015 }}\" with [[Wind rose]].

In case of fog, the runway 22L is equipped with an [[Instrument landing system|ILS of category III C]] system, which allows modern aircraft to land in zero sight. Runway 04R/22L was widened by 4 meters in each side at DKK 30M to accommodate the Airbus A380, as part of a general concrete renewal program of DKK 300M.<ref name=cpA380/><ref

These trains, running as local services between Copenhagen city centre and [[Helsing\u00f8r]], have a dense stopping pattern inside Denmark. \u00d8resundst\u00e5g also operates regional and intercity trains to destinations across the south of Sweden: [[Malm\u00f6]], [[Gothenburg]], [[Kalmar]], [[Karlskrona]], and [[Kristianstad]].\n*[[DSB (railway company)|DSB]], the Danish national rail operator, have InterCity and InterCityExpress trains calling at this station. Domestic destinations include [[Esbjerg]], [[Aarhus]], [[Aalborg]] and [[S\u00f8nderborg]]. DSB additionally runs trains to border cities of Germany and Sweden, such as [[Flensburg]] (Germany) and [[Ystad]] (Sweden), where a ferry connects the station to the Danish island of [[Bornholm]].\n* Swedish [[SJ AB|SJ]] runs several high-speed trains with daily departures between [[Copenhagen]] central station (K\u00f8benhavn H) and [[Stockholm]] central station (Stockholm C) and [[Gothenburg]] (G\u00f6teborg).

The Metro station is two floors above the underground rail station and continues on elevated tracks until it goes underground after 5 stations. The metro trains run very frequently; in rush hours every four minutes, outside rush hours and on weekends every six minutes, and every 15/20 minutes during night time.\n\n===Road===\n* [[Movia (transit agency)|Movia]] buses 5C, 35, 36 and Gr\u00e5hundbus line 999 all stop at the airport; bus 888, express-bus to [[Jutland]], also stops at the airport. Movia bus 2A stops near the airport. There are long-distance buses to Sweden and Norway operated by Swebus: 820 to Oslo via Gothenburg and 832 to Uppsala via Stockholm. GoByBus and Bus4You also operate the same routes.\n* The [[European route E20|E20]] motorway runs right by the airport. The E20 uses the toll road \u00d8resund Bridge to Sweden.

In 2015, 6.1% of passengers travelled to and from other Danish airports, 83.5% to/from other European airports, and 10.4% were intercontinental passengers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cph.dk/en/about-cph/press/news/cph-copenhagen-airport-grew-passenger-traffic-by-one-millions-in-2015/|title=About CPH \u2013 News|publisher=CPH Airport|accessdate=15 January 2016}}</ref> The airport is owned by [[K\u00f8benhavns Lufthavne]], which also operates [[Roskilde Airport]].

The formal name of the airport is still '''Copenhagen Airport, Kastrup''', to distinguish it from [[Roskilde Airport]], whose formal name is ''Copenhagen Airport, Roskilde''.\n\n==History==\nThe airport was inaugurated 20 April 1925 and was one of the first civil airports in the world. It consisted of a large, impressive terminal built of wood, a couple of hangars, a balloon mast, a hydroplane landing stage and a few grassy meadows that could be used as runways. The grass on the runways was kept short by sheep, which were shepherded away before take-offs and landings. From 1932 to 1939, takeoffs and landings increased from 6,000 to 50,000 and passenger number increased to 72,000. Between 1936 and 1939, a new terminal was built, considered one of the finest examples of [[Functionalism (architecture)#Nordic \"funkis\"|Nordic functionalism]]. The terminal was designed by [[Vilhelm Lauritzen]], who was considered a pioneer among architects, in terms not only of architecture and construction, but also of service and passenger comfort.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cph.dk/en/about-cph/profile/History/The-pioneer-era/|title=The pioneer era|accessdate=10 May 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402114836/http://www.cph.dk/en/about-cph/profile/History/The-pioneer-era/|archivedate=2 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the years of [[World War II]], the Copenhagen airport was closed for civil operations except for periodic flights to destinations in [[Sweden]], [[Germany]], and [[Austria]]. In the summer of 1941 the first hard-surface runway opened. It was {{convert|1400|m}} long and {{convert|65|m}} wide. When [[World War II]] ended in May 1945, Copenhagen had the most modern international airport in [[Europe]], because the airport remained untouched by actual acts of war.\n\nOn 1 August 1947, [[Scandinavian Airlines]] (SAS) was founded, an important event for the Copenhagen Airport, as Copenhagen was to be the main hub for the airline. Traffic increased rapidly in the first years SAS operated. On 26 January 1947, a [[KLM]] Douglas DC-3 \"Dakota\" [[1947 KLM Douglas DC-3 Copenhagen accident|crashed]] at the airport after stopping en route to [[Stockholm]]. 22 people on board died, including the Swedish prince [[Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of V\u00e4sterbotten|Gustav Adolf]] and the American opera singer [[Grace Moore]]. In 1948 Copenhagen airport was third largest airport in Europe with 150 daily takeoffs and almost 300,000 passengers for the year. The airport continued its rapid growth. The terminal was expanded several times and new hangars were erected.\n\nIn 1954, Scandinavian Airlines begins the world's first trans-polar route, flying initially to [[Los Angeles]]. The route proved to be a publicity coup, and for some years Copenhagen became a popular transit point for Hollywood stars and producers flying to Europe \u2013 also the airport handled 11,000 tonnes of freight per year. In 1956, the airport handled 1 million passengers per year and won the award{{clarify|date=April 2015|reason=which award?}} for the world's best airport. The runways were lengthened and fitted with technically advanced equipment.\n\n[[File:Kastrup Airport (12).jpg|thumb|Kastrup Airport in the 1960s.]]\nBy 10 May 1960, when the new airport terminal (now Terminal 2) was inaugurated, the daily number of jet operations had increased to 28, and still traffic kept on growing. The large new airport terminal soon became too small, and in 1969 yet another huge expansion programme was launched. Domestic traffic was relocated to a new domestic terminal (the eastern part of Terminal 1). The (current) international terminal was supplemented with a new pier (C) and a separate arrivals hall (the building between Terminals 2 and 3). A new control tower and {{convert|3600|m}} of additional runways allowed take-offs and landings to take place at the same time. When the comprehensive expansion was completed in 1972, the number of take-offs and landings exceeded 180,000 and there were more than eight million passengers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cph.dk/en/about-cph/profile/History/Interkontinental-1940-1972/|title=Interkontinental 1940\u20131972|accessdate=10 May 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518091030/http://www.cph.dk/en/about-cph/profile/History/Interkontinental-1940-1972/|archivedate=18 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1970s, airport traffic continued to grow, but the airport was not expanded further. A new large airport located at the island of [[Saltholm]] (with a connecting bridge to [[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]]) was on the drawing board. It would be a huge investment, and the proposal was evaluated thoroughly by many experts. In 1980, however, the Danish parliament instead decided to expand the capacity of Copenhagen airport to 20\u201322 million passengers by the year 2000. This solution was far cheaper than building a new airport and because the new types of aircraft were less noisy, an airport on Saltholm did not offer a decisive environmental gain. In 1973 the airport handled 8 million passengers per year. The third (long) runway opened and the dual runway system (04L/22R-04R/22L) opened, strongly expanding the starts and landings capacity.\n\nThe expansion of the airport began in 1982, after the necessary period of planning. The intention was not to build Europe's largest airport, but to build transit passengers' favourite airport. A stay at the airport was supposed to be an integral part of the travel experience. Efficiency and precision were obvious demands, but focus was also on generating an oasis where international travellers could relax: beautiful architecture, Scandinavian design, and pleasant, light, and comfortable surroundings with plenty of shops, restaurants, and other facilities providing enjoyment and pleasure. The new cargo terminal was built in the eastern area of the airport.\n\nA number of important construction projects were completed in 1998: a pier connecting the domestic and international terminals; a new arrivals hall; new modern baggage handling facilities; an underground railway station with two large underground parking facilities with 2400 spaces opens; and above it all the spacious and impressive delta-shaped terminal (Terminal 3) with 17 million passengers capacity. The first stage of the new Pier D was completed in the spring of 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cph.dk/en/about-cph/profile/History/Hub-1973-1999/|title=Hub 1973\u20131999|accessdate=10 May 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103000938/http://www.cph.dk/en/about-cph/profile/History/Hub-1973-1999/|archivedate=3 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn 1 July 2000 the [[\u00d8resund Bridge]] opened which connects Denmark and Sweden by motorway and train. In 2001 the five-star [[Hilton Worldwide|Hilton]] hotel opened with 382 rooms. In 2006 for the first time in its history Copenhagen airport exceeded 20 million passengers and reached 20,900,000 passengers. In October 2007 the metro station opened, connecting the airport to the [[Copenhagen Metro]]. A new control tower opened in 2008 by [[Naviair]] as part of a major renovation of the ATC system. Airport officials announced plans to build a new low-cost terminal at the facility. On 31 October 2010 the new low cost terminal CPH Go opened by [[easyJet]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cph.dk/en/about-cph/profile/History/The-airport-today-2000/|title=The airport today 2000+|accessdate=10 May 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103000704/http://www.cph.dk/en/about-cph/profile/History/The-airport-today-2000/|archivedate=3 January 2015}}</ref> In 2013 the airport handled a new record of 24,067,030 passengers.

These trains, running as local services between Copenhagen city centre and [[Helsing\u00f8r]], have a dense stopping pattern inside Denmark. \u00d8resundst\u00e5g also operates regional and intercity trains to destinations across the south of Sweden: [[Malm\u00f6]], [[Gothenburg]], [[Kalmar]], [[Karlskrona]], and [[Kristianstad]].\n*[[DSB (railway company)|DSB]], the Danish national rail operator, have InterCity and InterCityExpress trains calling at this station. Domestic destinations include [[Esbjerg]], [[Aarhus]], [[Aalborg]] and [[S\u00f8nderborg]]. DSB additionally runs trains to border cities of Germany and Sweden, such as [[Flensburg]] (Germany) and [[Ystad]] (Sweden), where a ferry connects the station to the Danish island of [[Bornholm]].\n* Swedish [[SJ AB|SJ]] runs several high-speed trains with daily departures between [[Copenhagen]] central station (K\u00f8benhavn H) and [[Stockholm]] central station (Stockholm C) and [[Gothenburg]] (G\u00f6teborg).

The Metro station is two floors above the underground rail station and continues on elevated tracks until it goes underground after 5 stations. The metro trains run very frequently; in rush hours every four minutes, outside rush hours and on weekends every six minutes, and every 15/20 minutes during night time.\n\n===Road===\n* [[Movia (transit agency)|Movia]] buses 5C, 35, 36 and Gr\u00e5hundbus line 999 all stop at the airport; bus 888, express-bus to [[Jutland]], also stops at the airport. Movia bus 2A stops near the airport. There are long-distance buses to Sweden and Norway operated by Swebus: 820 to Oslo via Gothenburg and 832 to Uppsala via Stockholm. GoByBus and Bus4You also operate the same routes.\n* The [[European route E20|E20]] motorway runs right by the airport. The E20 uses the toll road \u00d8resund Bridge to Sweden. The airport has 8,600 parking spaces.\n\n==Incidents and accidents==\n[[File:C-47.jpg|thumb|right|A Douglas Dakota, similar to the KLM aircraft that crashed in 1947.]]\n*{{Timeline-event|date={{Start date|1947|01|26|df=y}}|event= [[Douglas Dakota]] (DC-3), PH-TCR of [[KLM]] crashed after takeoff from Copenhagen, killing all 22 on board, including [[Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of V\u00e4sterbotten|Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden]] (father of present king [[Carl XVI Gustaf]]) and American singer and actress [[Grace Moore]].

Soon after the Douglas DC-3 aircraft took off, it climbed to an altitude of about 50 metres (150&nbsp;feet), [[Stall (flight)|stalled]], and plummeted nose-first to the ground where it exploded on impact.

He also felt that Burns did not properly explain why American generals ordered their forces to fight so fiercely for seemingly meaningless hills; Moyar feels that engaging the Viet Cong in sparsely populated areas was a superior option to letting them draw near populated cities, where American airpower and artillery would require more careful use. Moyar also contended that Burns and Novick should have more strongly emphasized the amount of foreign aid that the North Vietnamese received from the Chinese and that both Vietnams were not entirely self-sufficient. He also believed that Nixon, a mercurial president who expressed many contradictory opinions, could not be taken entirely seriously in the tape excerpts used in the documentary wherein he appears to express a desire to cut South Vietnam loose immediately after the 1972 elections and the Paris Peace Accords, while the documentary let the excerpts stand as seeming fact.<ref name=\"moyar\" />\n\nScholar [[Thomas Bass]] criticizes the film for its \"urge toward healing and reconciliation, rather than truth\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bass|first=Thomas A.|date=July 2017|title=America's Amnesia|url=https://mekongreview.com/americas-amnesia/|journal=[[Mekong Review]]|issue=8}}</ref> Bass's main objection is that the film perpetuates the narrative of the two Vietnams that justified U.S. involvement, arguing that \"Southern Vietnam was never an independent country\" and that [[Edward Lansdale]] played a role in that U.S. creation. He notes the prominent feature of [[Duong Van Mai Elliott]] in promoting this view, and the absence of a [[Daniel Ellsberg]] interview. Bass contends that this, together with the film's reliance on architects of the war such as \"former generals, CIA agents and government officials, who are not identified by rank or title, but merely by their names and anodyne descriptions\" is deemed as evidence of the film's \"conservative credentials\". ''[[Newsweek]]'' echoed Bass's objection that the movie obscures facts about the root causes of the war and its framing by the United States.<ref name=\"Newsweek\" >{{cite news |last=Stein |first=Jeff |date=September 17, 2017 |title= Vietnam War: New Ken Burns Documentary Dismisses the Origins of the Futile, Disastrous Conflict |url= http://www.newsweek.com/vietnam-ken-burns-vietnam-war-doc-documentary-pbs-666582 |work=Newsweek}}</ref>\n\nUniversity of Chicago historian Mark Philip Bradley gave the mini-series a mixed review, saying \"it is mainly unsuccessful at evoking the complexities of Vietnam\u2019s past...

He also felt that Burns did not properly explain why American generals ordered their forces to fight so fiercely for seemingly meaningless hills; Moyar feels that engaging the Viet Cong in sparsely populated areas was a superior option to letting them draw near populated cities, where American airpower and artillery would require more careful use. Moyar also contended that Burns and Novick should have more strongly emphasized the amount of foreign aid that the North Vietnamese received from the Chinese and that both Vietnams were not entirely self-sufficient. He also believed that Nixon, a mercurial president who expressed many contradictory opinions, could not be taken entirely seriously in the tape excerpts used in the documentary wherein he appears to express a desire to cut South Vietnam loose immediately after the 1972 elections and the Paris Peace Accords, while the documentary let the excerpts stand as seeming fact.<ref name=\"moyar\" />\n\nScholar [[Thomas Bass]] criticizes the film for its \"urge toward healing and reconciliation, rather than truth\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bass|first=Thomas A.|date=July 2017|title=America's Amnesia|url=https://mekongreview.com/americas-amnesia/|journal=[[Mekong Review]]|issue=8}}</ref> Bass's main objection is that the film perpetuates the narrative of the two Vietnams that justified U.S. involvement, arguing that \"Southern Vietnam was never an independent country\" and that [[Edward Lansdale]] played a role in that U.S. creation. He notes the prominent feature of [[Duong Van Mai Elliott]] in promoting this view, and the absence of a [[Daniel Ellsberg]] interview. Bass contends that this, together with the film\u2019s reliance on architects of the war such as \"former generals, CIA agents and government officials, who are not identified by rank or title, but merely by their names and anodyne descriptions\" is deemed as evidence of the film's \"conservative credentials\".

In May 1951 two crates were delivered to Churchill's London home. In a thank-you letter Churchill called the drink \"Commemoration Lager\". In Denmark the drink was called {{lang|da|P\u00e5skebryg}}&nbsp;(\"Easter Brew\"), but the Easter Brew has since been replaced by a weaker beer ({{lang|da|Carls P\u00e5ske}}). For the British market Carlsberg called the drink Special Brew, and production was started in [[Northampton]] in the 1950s.\n\nAt 7.5% alcohol (previously 9%, then 8% for a short time), Special Brew is part of a group of strong lagers that are termed \"super-strength\" in the UK and [[malt liquor]] in the USA. This beer is often associated with street alcoholics.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2005/oct/03/drugsandalcohol.homelessness | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Matthew | last=Weaver | title=Call for ban on super-strength 'tramp juice' | date=3 October 2005}}</ref>\n\nA single can (440mL) of Special Brew contains 3.5 [[Unit of alcohol|units of alcohol]] (previously 4.5 units) whilst the maximum recommended daily intake for a man is two units.

Since then, the Elephant has been a famous part of the Carlsberg family, especially after the strong Elephant Beer was created in 1955 under the name Export Lager Beer featuring the Elephant label.

It was designed by [[Thorvald Bindesb\u00f8ll]].<ref name=\"Carl\"/>\n\nIn Denmark the beer is often known as ''Hof'' ([[Noble court|court]]) due to its [[Royal warrant of appointment|Royal Warrant]].

It was initially brewed by Carlsberg to commemorate a visit to Denmark by [[Winston Churchill]] in 1950.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.carlsberggroup.com/brands/Pages/Carlsbergspecialbrew.aspx |title=Carlsberg Group \u2013 Carlsberg Special Brew |publisher=www.carlsberggroup.com |accessdate=7 March 2011}}</ref> The flavour incorporates \"cognac flavours among its tasting notes\" as Churchill was partial to brandy. In May 1951 two crates were delivered to Churchill's London home. In a thank-you letter Churchill called the drink \"Commemoration Lager\". In Denmark the drink was called {{lang|da|P\u00e5skebryg}}&nbsp;(\"Easter Brew\"), but the Easter Brew has since been replaced by a weaker beer ({{lang|da|Carls P\u00e5ske}}). For the British market Carlsberg called the drink Special Brew, and production was started in [[Northampton]] in the 1950s.\n\nAt 7.5% alcohol (previously 9%, then 8% for a short time), Special Brew is part of a group of strong lagers that are termed \"super-strength\" in the UK and [[malt liquor]] in the USA. This beer is often associated with street alcoholics.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2005/oct/03/drugsandalcohol.homelessness | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Matthew | last=Weaver | title=Call for ban on super-strength 'tramp juice' | date=3 October 2005}}</ref>\n\nA single can (440mL) of Special Brew contains 3.5 [[Unit of alcohol|units of alcohol]] (previously 4.5 units) whilst the maximum recommended daily intake for a man is two units. In January 2015, it was reported that Carlsberg would reduce the units per can to less than four, in line with a UK government pledge that no single can should contain more than four units. The change, a reduction either in the size of the can from 500mL to 440mL, or the alcoholic strength of the beer, was considered for implementation in 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-30795336 |title=The secret history of Special Brew |publisher=BBC |accessdate=13 January 2015}}</ref> Both changes were made; the cans have since been reduced to 440 mL, and the ABV reduced from 9% to 8%, then another drop to 7.5%.\n\n=== Elephant beer ===\n[[Image:Elefantporten (Carlsberg).jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Elephant Gate and Tower, Carlsberg|Elephant Gate]] in Copenhagen, Denmark]] \n[[Image:Carlsberg Elephant Beer.jpg|thumb|upright|50px|Elephant beer]]\nIn 1901, at brewer Carl Jacobsen's initiative, the Architect Professor J. L. Dahlerup created a tower resting on four elephants carved in granite from the Danish island of [[Bornholm]]. Jacobsen's inspiration was the obelisk supporting an elephant on the [[Piazza della Minerva]] in Rome.<ref>[http://www.visitcarlsberg.dk/history/Footprints/Valby/Pages/TheElephantTower.aspx Visit Carlsberg]</ref> The four elephants each bear the initial of one of Carl Jacobsen's children: Theodora, Paula, Helge and Vagn. This became known as The Elephant Gate and is a landmark entrance to the brewery. \n\nTo the west of the gate, Carl Jacobsen's motto was inscribed: Laboremus pro Patria (Let us work for our country). Since then, the Elephant has been a famous part of the Carlsberg family, especially after the strong Elephant Beer was created in 1955 under the name Export Lager Beer featuring the Elephant label. The Elephant is still brewed in Carlsberg Breweries in Copenhagen and exported around the world.
