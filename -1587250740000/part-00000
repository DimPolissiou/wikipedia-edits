SAS was first again, flying Europe to [[Tokyo]] via [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] with [[Douglas DC-7C]]s in February 1957; [[Air France]] [[Lockheed L-1649 Starliner]] (which was the final version of the [[Lockheed Constellation]]) and [[KLM]] [[DC-7C]] aircraft followed in 1958.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blog.klm.com/to-tokyo-with-a-dc-7-over-the-north-pole/|title=To Tokyo with a DC-7 over the North Pole|date=23 November 2014|website=KLM Blog}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Cold War]], the Arctic region was a buffer zone between the [[Soviet Union]] and North America. Civilian flights from Europe to the Asian [[Far East]] were prohibited from crossing the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries, Soviet Union or [[China]], and either had to fly via the [[Middle East]] or fly across Arctic North America and Greenland with a refueling stop in Anchorage. These Cold War tracks extended from the northern Alaskan coast across [[Greenland]] to Europe. [[Korean Air Lines Flight 902]] operated with a [[Boeing 707]] was shot down over the USSR by a [[Soviet Air Force]] fighter aircraft in 1978 after the flight crew made gross navigational errors attempting to fly the assigned polar route.\n\nIn April 1967 [[Japan Air Lines]] (JAL) began an experimental service between Tokyo and Europe via Moscow across Siberia. This service used an [[Aeroflot]] [[Tupolev Tu-114]], with one JAL flight crew and mixed JAL and Aeroflot cabin crew. However, Japan Air Lines dropped the service in 1969.\n\nDuring the Cold War, [[Anchorage International Airport]] (ANC) in [[Alaska]] was a technical stop for a number of airlines flying the polar route between western [[Europe]] and [[Tokyo]]. According to the July 1, 1983 edition of the Worldwide [[Official Airline Guide]] (OAG), [[Air France]], [[British Airways]], [[Japan Air Lines]] (JAL), [[KLM Royal Dutch Airlines]], [[Lufthansa]], [[Sabena]] and [[Scandinavian Airlines]] (SAS) were all operating flights between [[Japan]] and western Europe which included a stop in Anchorage.<ref>http://www.departedflights.com, July 1, 1983 Worldwide Official Airline Guide (OAG), Tokyo-Anchorage flight schedules</ref> Most of these international airlines were operating earlier model [[Boeing 747]] aircraft on the route at this time, although Sabena and SAS were instead operating [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30]] aircraft on their respective polar route services via Anchorage. U.S. based air carrier [[Western Airlines]] also flew a polar route during the early 1980s between [[London Gatwick Airport]] and [[Honolulu]] using DC-10-30 aircraft, with these flights also making a stop in Anchorage.<ref>http://www.departedflights.com, March 1, 1981 Western Airlines system timetable</ref>\n\nThe only airline that still flies this type of route between Europe and Anchorage is [[Condor Airlines]], flying from [[Frankfurt Airport| Frankfurt (EDDF)]] to Anchorage without an eastward continuation using a [[Boeing 767]]. This will soon be joined by a flight by [[Eurowings]], also from Frankfurt, using an [[Airbus A330]].\n\n[[Finnair]] was the first airline to fly non-stop via the Arctic Ocean - Alaska polar route without a technical stop. This service began in 1983 and was flown with a [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30]] wide body jetliner between Tokyo and [[Helsinki]].<ref>http://www.departedflights.com, July 1, 1983 Worldwide Official Airline Guide (OAG), Tokyo-Helsinki flight schedules</ref><ref name=Sunnuntaisivut>{{cite journal | last = Huhtanen | first = Ann-Mari | authorlink = | editor = | editor-link = | date = 7 September 2014 | month = | title = Perhana, se tulee suoraan kohti.

Russian [[Long-Range Aviation]] now perform some of the same types of training flights, testing the readiness of [[Alaskan Command]] and [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] interceptors.<ref>[https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/military/2017/04/21/russian-military-planes-intercepted-off-alaska-for-4th-straight-night/ Russian military planes approach Alaska for 4th straight night], Anchorage Daily News, Published April 21, 2017.</ref>\n\n===After the Cold War===\nImmediately after the Cold War, a number of direct southern routes had opened up between Europe and Asia over the Black Sea and southern former Soviet republics across Afghanistan, and by the mid-1990s, over China. In Russia's eastern and Arctic regions there were significant problems with lack of [[English language|English-speaking]] controllers, lack of radio facilities, poor radar coverage, poor ATC capacity, and a lack of funds. To solve these issues, [[RACGAT]] (Russian-American Coordinating Group for Air Traffic) was formed in 1993.

Hence, the \"westbound\" flight from Buenos Aires would actually travel south-east south of [[Cape Town]], over the southern [[Indian Ocean]] and on to Perth, while the true \"eastbound\" flight would also head south-east south of [[Tasmania]] and [[New Zealand]], over the [[South Seas|South Pacific]] and on to South America. If this route becomes operational, a Buenos Aires\u2013Singapore return flight would possibly be the fastest [[circumnavigation]] available with commercial airliners, although Perth\u2013Buenos Aires return would be faster but without passing the [[Equator]].\n\n==Operational considerations==\nThe FAA's policy letter ''Guidance for Polar Operations'' (March 5, 2001) outlines a number of special requirements for polar flight, which includes two cold-weather suits, special communication capability, designation of Arctic [[diversion airport]]s and firm recovery plans for stranded passengers, and fuel freeze strategy and monitoring requirements.<ref name=\"boeing.com\"/>\n\n[[Jet fuel]] freeze temperatures range between {{convert|-40|and|-50|C|abbr=on}}. These temperatures are frequently encountered at cruise altitude throughout the world with no effect since the fuel retains heat from lower elevations, but the intense cold and extended duration of polar flights may cause fuel temperature to approach its freezing point. Jet A grade with a maximum freeze point of {{convert|-40|C|abbr=on}} is used in the U.S., while Jet A1 grade with a maximum freeze point of {{convert|-47|C|abbr=on}} is used elsewhere.<ref>[ASTM specification D1655]</ref> Modern long-distance airliners are equipped to alert flight crew when fuel temperatures reach {{convert|3|C-change|abbr=on}} above these levels. The crew must then change altitude, though in some cases due to the low [[stratosphere]] over polar regions and its inversion properties the air may actually be somewhat warmer at higher altitudes.<ref name=\"boeing.com\"/>\n\nThe alerts are typically set at {{convert|3|C-change|abbr=on}} above the specified maximum freeze point. This provides a {{convert|3|C-change|abbr=on}} safety margin from the solidification temperature. However, fuels produced at the refineries are often better than the spec values; for example, it is not uncommon to find Jet A fuels that have measured freeze point better (colder) than the specified maximum of {{convert|-40|C|abbr=on}}. In that way, the safety margin is even larger than {{convert|3|C-change|abbr=on}}. On the other hand, the temperature probe that delivers fuel temperature information to the flight deck is not located in the coldest part of the fuel tanks. The difference between the recorded and the coldest fuel temperature varies depending on a variety of factors, especially the circulation of fuel in the tanks and duration of cold soak. It is, therefore, prudent to have a safety margin.\n\nFor polar flights, FAA allows,<ref>https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/73587</ref> under certain conditions, the measured freeze point be used instead of assuming the spec value in ASTM D1655. This gives the airlines more flexibility in flight planning.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Geography}}\n* [[Longest flights]]\n* [[Great circle]]\n* [[Antarctica]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20020329000146/http://www.racgat.com/ RACGAT website] \u2013 archived in 2003\n* [http://www.flightradar24.com/blog/flight-paths-and-great-circles-or-why-you-flew-over-greenland/ Flightradar24 blog page \u2013 Why you flew over Greenland]\n\n{{Arctic topics}}\n\n[[Category:Air traffic control]]\n[[Category:Air navigation]]\n[[Category:Polar regions of the Earth]]\n[[Category:Airline routes]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=September 2014}}\n[[Image:PolarRoute.png|right|500px|General arrangement of polar routes in the late 20th century (left) and in the 2000s (center) and in the Southern Hemisphere (right).]]\n\nA '''polar route''' is an [[Flight path|aircraft route]] across the uninhabited polar ice cap regions.

Civilian flights from Europe to the Asian [[Far East]] were prohibited from crossing the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries, Soviet Union or [[China]], and either had to fly via the [[Middle East]] or fly across Arctic North America and Greenland with a refueling stop in Anchorage. These Cold War tracks extended from the northern Alaskan coast across [[Greenland]] to Europe. [[Korean Air Lines Flight 902]] operated with a [[Boeing 707]] was shot down over the USSR by a [[Soviet Air Force]] fighter aircraft in 1978 after the flight crew made gross navigational errors attempting to fly the assigned polar route.\n\nIn April 1967 [[Japan Air Lines]] (JAL) began an experimental service between Tokyo and Europe via Moscow across Siberia. This service used an [[Aeroflot]] [[Tupolev Tu-114]], with one JAL flight crew and mixed JAL and Aeroflot cabin crew. However, Japan Air Lines dropped the service in 1969.\n\nDuring the Cold War, [[Anchorage International Airport]] (ANC) in [[Alaska]] was a technical stop for a number of airlines flying the polar route between western [[Europe]] and [[Tokyo]].

Nonstop flights between [[South Africa]] and [[New Zealand]], or between [[Perth|Perth, Australia]] and certain destinations in [[South America]] (including [[Buenos Aires]] and [[S\u00e3o Paulo]]), would overfly Antarctica, but no airline has scheduled such flights.\n\nFlights between Australia and South America and between Australia and South Africa pass near the Antarctic coastline. Depending on the winds, the [[Qantas]] flight QFA63 from [[Sydney Airport|Sydney]] to [[O. R. Tambo International Airport|Johannesburg-O. R. Tambo]], or the return flight QFA64, sometimes flies over the Antarctic Circle to 71\u00b0 latitude as well and allowing views of the icecap.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gotravelyourway.com/2013/07/20/qantas-flight-qf63-from-sydney-to-johannesburg/ |title=gotravelyourway}}</ref>{{Better source|reason=The link has no information this flight at 71\u00b0 latitude. |date=September 2019}} [[Qantas]] QFA27 and QFA28 fly nonstop between [[Sydney Airport|Sydney]] and [[Comodoro Arturo Merino Ben\u00edtez International Airport|Santiago de Chile]], the most southerly polar route. Depending on winds, this flight may reach 55\u00b0 south latitude. Until 2014, [[Aerol\u00edneas Argentinas]] flew nonstop between [[Sydney Airport|Sydney]] and [[Ministro Pistarini International Airport|Buenos Aires]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://flightaware.com/live/flight/ARG1180 |title=Flightaware website}}</ref>{{Better source|reason=The link is to a flight which no longer operates and only shows a great circle route, not actual flight path.|date=September 2014}} Previously, QANTAS also operated QFA17 and QFA18 between Sydney, Australia and Buenos Aires, Argentina. Nowadays, LATAM operates LAN804 and LAN805 between Melbourne, Australia, and Santiago, Chile, and Air New Zealand operates ANZ30 and ANZ31 between Auckland, New Zealand and Buenos Aires, Argentina all with similarly south-running routes.\n\nThe polar route across the remote southern Pacific Ocean between South America and Oceania was pioneered by [[Aerolineas Argentinas]], which began service between Buenos Aires via Rio Gallegos to Auckland in the 1980s with a [[Boeing 747-200]] aircraft. Aerolineas Argentinas later operated to Sydney, but ended its flights to New Zealand and Australia in 2014.<ref name=\"SC: AA flights\">{{cite web|last1=Chui|first1=Sam|title=Aerolineas Argentinas Transpolar Flight \"Vuelo Transpolar\" Sydney \u2013 Buenos Aires|url=https://samchui.com/2014/03/21/aerolineas-argentinas-vuelo-transpolar-sydney-buenos-aires-southern-polar-flight/#.WNCYS3-7Fnk|website=Sam Chui Aviation & Travel|accessdate=21 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nBecause of [[ETOPS]] limitations on twin-engined aircraft\u2014the maximum distance the aircraft can operate from an airport for emergency landings\u2014only four-engined aircraft such as the [[Boeing 747]], [[Airbus A340]], and Airbus A380 can or could operate routes near Antarctica. Twin-engined aircraft must fly further north, closer to potential diversion airports; for example, when [[Virgin Australia]] operated their VA 15 and VA 16 flights between Melbourne and Johannesburg on twin-engined Boeing 777 aircraft with a 180-minute ETOPS rating, the flight was two hours longer than a Qantas flight from Sydney to Johannesburg.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Freed|first1=Jamie|title=Virgin Australia brings back direct flights to Johannesburg through South African Airways codeshare|url=http://www.bordermail.com.au/story/2596703/virgin-australia-brings-back-direct-flights-to-johannesburg-through-south-african-airways-codeshare/|accessdate=21 March 2017|work=The Border Mail|date=1 October 2014}}</ref> [[Air New Zealand]] flight ANZ30 and ANZ31 flies nonstop between [[Auckland Airport|Auckland]] and [[Ministro Pistarini International Airport|Buenos Aires-Ezeiza]]; in 2015, government regulators approved its twin-engined Boeing 777-200ER aircraft that operate the route for a 330-minute ETOPS rating (i.e. its 777 aircraft can fly a maximum 330 minutes away from the nearest diversion airport), an increase from its previous 240-minute ETOPS rating.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Carey|first1=Bill|title=Air New Zealand 777 Makes First 330-Minute ETOPS Flight|url=http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/air-transport/2015-12-02/air-new-zealand-777-makes-first-330-minute-etops-flight|accessdate=21 March 2017|work=AINonline|publisher=The Convention News Company, Inc.|date=2 December 2015}}</ref> [[LATAM Chile|LATAM Airlines]] began their LAN800 and LAN801 nonstop flights between [[Comodoro Arturo Merino Ben\u00edtez International Airport|Santiago de Chile]] and [[Sydney Airport|Sydney]] via [[Auckland Airport|Auckland]] in April 2015 with twin-engined Boeing 787 aircraft with a 330-minute ETOPS rating.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Leaman|first1=Aaron|title=Flight test: Auckland to Santiago on LATAM's Boeing 787-9|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/travel/news/82400804/flight-test-auckland-to-santiago-on-latams-boeing-7879|accessdate=21 March 2017|work=Stuff|date=31 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Clark|first1=Peter|title=PICTURE: LAN avails of 787 ETOPS certification|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/picture-lan-avails-of-787-etops-certification-411442/|accessdate=21 March 2017|work=Flight Global|date=22 April 2015}}</ref> LATAM has announced a nonstop flight between Santiago de Chile and Melbourne (LAN804/LAN805) to begin in October 2017.<ref>{{cite news|title=LATAM to serve Melbourne-Santiago nonstop from October 2017|url=http://australianaviation.com.au/2016/12/latam-to-serve-melbourne-santiago-nonstop-from-october-2017/|accessdate=21 March 2017|work=Australian Aviation|date=5 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Flynn|first1=David|title=LATAM to fly Melbourne-Santiago from October 2017|url=https://www.ausbt.com.au/latam-to-fly-melbourne-santiago|accessdate=21 March 2017|work=Australian Business Traveller|date=5 December 2016}}</ref> In late 2019, LATAM began direct flights between Santiago and Sydney (LA802/LAN803) competing with the existing QANTAS (QFA27/QFA28) flights on the same route. \n\nThe southernmost flight route with plausible airports would be between [[Ministro Pistarini International Airport|Buenos Aires]] and [[Perth Airport|Perth]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greatcirclemapper.net/en/great-circle-mapper.html?route=SAEZ-YPPH&aircraft=73&speed= |title=Great Circle Mapper: EZE-PER |website=Great Circle Mapper }}</ref> With a 175\u00b0 (S) [[Course (navigation)#Aircraft heading|heading]], the route's [[great circle]] exceeds 85\u00b0 S and would be within {{convert|500|km|order=flip}} of the [[South Pole]]. Currently, no commercial airliners operates this {{convert|6800|nmi|mi km|adj=on}} route. However, in February, 2018, it was stated that [[Norwegian Air Argentina]] is considering this \"less than 15 hours\" trans-polar flight between [[South America]] and [[Asia]], with a stop-over in Perth enroute [[Singapore]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thewest.com.au/travel/air-aviation/perth-stopover-on-world-first-flight-linking-south-america-and-asia-to-boost-wa-tourism-ng-b88751880z|title=World-first South American flight to boost WA tourism|date=25 February 2018|website=The West Australian}}</ref> They will not fly over the [[South Pole]], but around [[Antarctica]] taking advantage of the strong winds which circle that continent in an easterly direction. Hence, the \"westbound\" flight from Buenos Aires would actually travel south-east south of [[Cape Town]], over the southern [[Indian Ocean]] and on to Perth, while the true \"eastbound\" flight would also head south-east south of [[Tasmania]] and [[New Zealand]], over the [[South Seas|South Pacific]] and on to South America. If this route becomes operational, a Buenos Aires\u2013Singapore return flight would possibly be the fastest [[circumnavigation]] available with commercial airliners, although Perth\u2013Buenos Aires return would be faster but without passing the [[Equator]].\n\n==Operational considerations==\nThe FAA's policy letter ''Guidance for Polar Operations'' (March 5, 2001) outlines a number of special requirements for polar flight, which includes two cold-weather suits, special communication capability, designation of Arctic [[diversion airport]]s and firm recovery plans for stranded passengers, and fuel freeze strategy and monitoring requirements.<ref name=\"boeing.com\"/>\n\n[[Jet fuel]] freeze temperatures range between {{convert|-40|and|-50|C|abbr=on}}. These temperatures are frequently encountered at cruise altitude throughout the world with no effect since the fuel retains heat from lower elevations, but the intense cold and extended duration of polar flights may cause fuel temperature to approach its freezing point. Jet A grade with a maximum freeze point of {{convert|-40|C|abbr=on}} is used in the U.S., while Jet A1 grade with a maximum freeze point of {{convert|-47|C|abbr=on}} is used elsewhere.<ref>[ASTM specification D1655]</ref> Modern long-distance airliners are equipped to alert flight crew when fuel temperatures reach {{convert|3|C-change|abbr=on}} above these levels. The crew must then change altitude, though in some cases due to the low [[stratosphere]] over polar regions and its inversion properties the air may actually be somewhat warmer at higher altitudes.<ref name=\"boeing.com\"/>\n\nThe alerts are typically set at {{convert|3|C-change|abbr=on}} above the specified maximum freeze point. This provides a {{convert|3|C-change|abbr=on}} safety margin from the solidification temperature. However, fuels produced at the refineries are often better than the spec values; for example, it is not uncommon to find Jet A fuels that have measured freeze point better (colder) than the specified maximum of {{convert|-40|C|abbr=on}}. In that way, the safety margin is even larger than {{convert|3|C-change|abbr=on}}. On the other hand, the temperature probe that delivers fuel temperature information to the flight deck is not located in the coldest part of the fuel tanks. The difference between the recorded and the coldest fuel temperature varies depending on a variety of factors, especially the circulation of fuel in the tanks and duration of cold soak. It is, therefore, prudent to have a safety margin.\n\nFor polar flights, FAA allows,<ref>https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/73587</ref> under certain conditions, the measured freeze point be used instead of assuming the spec value in ASTM D1655. This gives the airlines more flexibility in flight planning.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Geography}}\n* [[Longest flights]]\n* [[Great circle]]\n* [[Antarctica]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20020329000146/http://www.racgat.com/ RACGAT website] \u2013 archived in 2003\n* [http://www.flightradar24.com/blog/flight-paths-and-great-circles-or-why-you-flew-over-greenland/ Flightradar24 blog page \u2013 Why you flew over Greenland]\n\n{{Arctic topics}}\n\n[[Category:Air traffic control]]\n[[Category:Air navigation]]\n[[Category:Polar regions of the Earth]]\n[[Category:Airline routes]]\n", "name_user": "Miss Zeyneb", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAntarctica", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_route"}
