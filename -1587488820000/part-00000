There are [[biogeochemistry|biogeochemical]] cycles for the chemical elements [[calcium cycle|calcium]], [[carbon cycle|carbon]], [[hydrogen cycle|hydrogen]], [[mercury cycle|mercury]], [[nitrogen cycle|nitrogen]], [[oxygen cycle|oxygen]], [[phosphorus cycle|phosphorus]], [[selenium cycle|selenium]], and [[sulfur cycle|sulfur]]; molecular cycles for [[water cycle|water]] and [[silica cycle|silica]]; macroscopic cycles such as the [[rock cycle]]; as well as human-induced cycles for synthetic compounds such as [[polychlorinated biphenyl]] (PCB). In some cycles there are ''reservoirs'' where a substance remains for a long period of time.\n\n== Systems ==\n[[Image:Plagiomnium affine laminazellen.jpeg|thumb|[[Chloroplasts]] conduct [[photosynthesis]] and are found  in [[plant cell]]s and other [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] organisms. These are Chloroplasts visible in the cells of ''Plagiomnium affine'' \u2014 Many-fruited Thyme-moss.]]\nEcological systems ([[ecosystem]]s) have many biogeochemical cycles operating as a part of the system, for example the water cycle, the carbon cycle, the nitrogen cycle, etc.\nAll chemical elements occurring in organisms are part of biogeochemical cycles. In addition to being a part of living organisms, these chemical elements also cycle through abiotic factors of ecosystems such as water ([[hydrosphere]]), land ([[lithosphere]]), and/or the air ([[atmosphere]]).<ref name=\"enviroliteracy.org\">{{cite web|title=Biogeochemical Cycles|url=http://www.enviroliteracy.org/subcategory.php/198.html|publisher=The Environmental Literacy Council|accessdate=20 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe living factors of the planet can be referred to collectively as the biosphere. All the nutrients\u2014such as [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], [[phosphorus]], and [[sulfur]]\u2014used in ecosystems by living organisms are a part of a ''closed system''; therefore, these chemicals are recycled instead of being lost and replenished constantly such as in an open system.<ref name=\"enviroliteracy.org\"/>\n\nThe flow of energy in an ecosystem is an ''open system''; the sun constantly gives the planet energy in the form of light while it is eventually used and lost in the form of heat throughout the [[trophic level]]s of a food web.  Carbon is used to make carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, the major sources of [[food energy]].  These compounds are oxidized to release carbon dioxide, which can be captured by plants to make organic compounds.  The [[chemical reaction]] is powered by the light energy of the sun.\n\nSunlight is required to combine carbon with hydrogen and oxygen into an energy source, but ecosystems in the [[deep sea]], where no sunlight can penetrate, obtain energy from sulfur. [[Hydrogen sulfide]] near [[hydrothermal vent]]s can be utilized by organisms such as the [[giant tube worm]].  In the [[sulfur cycle]], sulfur can be forever recycled as a source of energy.  Energy can be released through the [[oxidation]] and [[redox|reduction]] of sulfur compounds (e.g., oxidizing elemental sulfur to [[sulfite]] and then to [[sulfate]]).\n\nAlthough the Earth constantly receives energy from the sun, its chemical composition is essentially fixed, as additional matter is only occasionally added by meteorites. Because this chemical composition is not replenished like energy, all processes that depend on these chemicals must be recycled. These cycles include both the living biosphere and the nonliving lithosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere.\n\n== Reservoirs ==\n[[Image:Coal anthracite.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|Coal is a reservoir of [[carbon]].]]\nThe chemicals are sometimes held for long periods of time in one place. This place is called a ''reservoir'', which, for example, includes such things as [[coal]] deposits that are storing [[carbon]] for a long period of time.<ref name=\"carbon\">{{cite web|last1=Baedke|first1=Steve J.|last2=Fichter|first2=Lynn S.|title=Biogeochemical Cycles: Carbon Cycle|url=http://csmgeo.csm.jmu.edu/geollab/idls/carboncycle.htm|website=Supplimental Lecture Notes for Geol 398|publisher=James Madison University|accessdate=20 November 2017}}</ref> When chemicals are held for only short periods of time, they are being held in ''exchange pools''. Examples of exchange pools include plants and animals.<ref name=\"carbon\" />\n\nPlants and animals utilize carbon to produce carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, which can then be used to build their internal structures or to obtain energy.  Plants and animals temporarily use carbon in their systems and then release it back into the air or surrounding medium.  Generally, reservoirs are abiotic factors whereas exchange pools are biotic factors. Carbon is held for a relatively short time in plants and animals in comparison to coal deposits. The amount of time that a chemical is held in one place is called its ''[[residence time]]''.<ref name=\"carbon\" />\n\n== Important cycles ==\n\nThe most well-known and important biogeochemical cycles are shown below:\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"180\" heights=\"150\">\nImage:Carbon cycle-cute diagram.svg|alt=Diagram of the carbon cycle|[[Carbon cycle]]\nImage:Nitrogen_Cycle.jpg|alt=Diagram of the nitrogen cycle|[[Nitrogen cycle]]\nImage:WhalePump.jpg|alt=Diagram of the nutrient cycle|[[Nutrient cycle]]\nImage:Oxygen cycle.svg|alt=Diagram of the oxygen cycle|[[Oxygen cycle]]\nImage:phoscycle-EPA.jpg|alt=Diagram of the phosphorus cycle|[[Phosphorus cycle]]\nImage:SulfurCycle copy.jpg|alt=Diagram of the sulfur cycle|[[Sulfur cycle]]\nImage:Rockcycle.jpg|alt=Diagram of the rock cycle|[[Rock cycle]]\nImage:Water cycle.png|alt=Diagram of the water cycle|[[Water cycle]]\n</gallery>\nThere are many biogeochemical cycles that are currently being studied for the first time as [[climate change]] and human impacts are drastically changing the speed, intensity, and balance of these relatively unknown cycles. These newly studied biogeochemical cycles include \n* the [[mercury cycle]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Mercury Cycling in the Environment|url=http://wi.water.usgs.gov/mercury/mercury-cycling.html|website=Wisconsin Water Science Center|publisher=United States Geological Survey|date=10 January 2013|accessdate=20 November 2017}}</ref> and \n* the human-caused cycle of PCBs.<ref>{{cite book |title=Organic contaminants that leave traces : sources, transport and fate |publisher=Ifremer |isbn=9782759200139 |pages=22\u201323}}</ref>\n\nBiogeochemical cycles always involve hot equilibrium states: a balance in the cycling of the element between compartments. However, overall balance may involve compartments distributed on a global scale.\n\nAs biogeochemical cycles describe the movements of substances on the entire globe, the study of these is inherently multidisciplinary.  The carbon cycle may be related to research in [[ecology]] and [[atmospheric sciences]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=McGuire|first=1A. D. |last2=Lukina|first2=N.

The concept came into common use with [[Unix]] text-processing utilities. Different [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntaxes]] for writing regular expressions have existed since the 1980s<!---introduction of POSIX and Perl--->, one being the [[POSIX]] standard and another, widely used, being the [[Perl]] syntax.\n\nRegular expressions are used in [[search engine]]s, search and replace dialogs of [[word processor]]s and [[text editor]]s, in text processing utilities such as [[sed]] and [[AWK]] and in [[lexical analysis]]. Many [[programming language]]s provide regex capabilities either built-in or via [[Library (computing)|libraries]].<!-- not too much info here.

Most other languages offer regexes via a library.-->\n\n==History==\nRegular expressions originated in 1951, when mathematician [[Stephen Cole Kleene]] described [[regular language]]s using his mathematical notation called ''regular events''.{{sfn|Kleene|1951}}<ref name = \"Leung, New Mexico State University, 2010\" >{{ Cite web | url = https://www.cs.nmsu.edu/historical-projects/Projects/kleene.9.16.10.pdf | title = Regular Languages and Finite Automata | access-date = 13 August 2019 | first = Hing | last = Leung | date = 16 September 2010 | website = [[New Mexico State University]] | quote = The concept of regular events was introduced by Kleene via the definition of regular expressions. | format = pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131205193130/https://www.cs.nmsu.edu/historical-projects/Projects/kleene.9.16.10.pdf | archive-date = 5 December 2013  | df = dmy-all }}</ref> These arose in [[theoretical computer science]], in the subfields of [[automata theory]] (models of computation) and the description and classification of [[formal language]]s. Other early implementations of [[pattern matching]] include the [[SNOBOL]] language, which did not use regular expressions, but instead its own pattern matching constructs.\n\nRegular expressions entered popular use from 1968 in two uses: pattern matching in a text editor{{sfn|Thompson|1968}} and lexical analysis in a compiler.{{sfn|Johnson|Porter|Ackley|Ross|1968}} Among the first appearances of regular expressions in program form was when [[Ken Thompson]] built Kleene's notation into the editor [[QED (text editor)|QED]] as a means to match patterns in [[text file]]s.{{sfn|Thompson|1968}}<ref name=\"Beautiful Code Kernighan\">{{cite book | last1 = Kernighan | first1 = Brian | authorlink1 = Brian Kernighan | title = Beautiful Code | chapter = A Regular Expressions Matcher | publisher = [[O'Reilly Media]] | pages = 1\u20132 | chapter-url = http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr09/cos333/beautiful.html | accessdate = 2013-05-15 | isbn = 978-0-596-51004-6| date = 2007-08-08 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/dmr/qed.html |title=An incomplete history of the QED Text Editor |last1=Ritchie |first1=Dennis M. |publisher= |accessdate=9 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990221023422/http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/dmr/qed.html |archive-date=1999-02-21 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>{{sfn|Aho|Ullman|1992|loc=10.11 Bibliographic Notes for Chapter 10, p. 589}} For speed, Thompson implemented regular expression matching by [[just-in-time compilation]] (JIT) to [[IBM 7094]] code on the [[Compatible Time-Sharing System]], an important early example of JIT compilation.{{sfn|Aycock|2003|loc=2. JIT Compilation Techniques, 2.1 Genesis, p. 98}} He later added this capability to the Unix editor [[ed (text editor)|ed]], which eventually led to the popular search tool [[grep]]'s use of regular expressions (\"grep\" is a word derived from the command for regular expression searching in the ed editor: <code>g/''re''/p</code> meaning \"Global search for Regular Expression and Print matching lines\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://catb.org/jargon/html/G/grep.html | title=Jargon File 4.4.7: grep | author=[[Eric S.

Ross]] implemented a tool based on regular expressions that is used for [[lexical analysis]] in [[compiler]] design.{{sfn|Johnson|Porter|Ackley|Ross|1968}}\n\nMany variations of these original forms of regular expressions were used in [[Unix]]{{sfn|Aho|Ullman|1992|loc=10.11 Bibliographic Notes for Chapter 10, p. 589}} programs at [[Bell Labs]] in the 1970s, including [[vi]], [[Lex programming tool|lex]], [[sed]], [[AWK]], and [[expr]], and in other programs such as [[Emacs]]. Regexes were subsequently adopted by a wide range of programs, with these early forms standardized in the [[POSIX.2]] standard in 1992.\n\nIn the 1980s the more complicated regexes arose in [[Perl]], which originally derived from a regex library written by [[Henry Spencer]] (1986), who later wrote an implementation of ''Advanced Regular Expressions'' for [[Tcl]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tcl.tk/doc/howto/regexp81.html | title = New Regular Expression Features in Tcl 8.1 | accessdate = 2013-10-11}}</ref> The Tcl library is a hybrid [[Nondeterministic finite automaton|NFA]]/[[Deterministic finite automaton|DFA]] implementation with improved performance characteristics.

These rules maintain existing features of Perl 5.x regexes, but also allow [[Backus\u2013Naur form|BNF]]-style definition of a [[recursive descent parser]] via sub-rules.\n\nThe use of regexes in structured information standards for document and database modeling started in the 1960s and expanded in the 1980s when industry standards like [[Standard Generalized Markup Language|ISO SGML]] (precursored by ANSI \"GCA 101-1983\") consolidated. The kernel of the [[XML schema#Validation|structure specification language]] standards consists of regexes. Its use is evident in the [[Document Type Definition|DTD]] element group syntax.\n\nStarting in 1997, [[Philip Hazel]] developed [[Perl Compatible Regular Expressions|PCRE]] (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions), which attempts to closely mimic Perl's regex functionality and is used by many modern tools including [[PHP]] and [[Apache HTTP Server]].\n\nToday, regexes are widely supported in programming languages, text processing programs (particularly [[Lexical analysis|lexers]]), advanced text editors, and some other programs. Regex support is part of the [[standard library]] of many programming languages, including [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]], and is built into the syntax of others, including Perl and [[ECMAScript]]. Implementations of regex functionality is often called a '''regex engine''', and a number of libraries are available for reuse. In the late 2010s, several companies started to offer hardware, [[FPGA]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://grovf.com/products/gregex|title=GROVF {{!}} Big Data Analytics Acceleration|website=grovf.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref>, [[GPU]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bkase.github.io/CUDA-grep/finalreport.html|title=CUDA grep|website=bkase.github.io|access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref> implementations of [[PCRE]] compatible '''regex engines''' that are faster compared to [[Central processing unit|CPU]] implementations'''.'''\n\n==Basic concepts==\nA regular expression, often called a ''pattern'', specifies a [[Set (computer science)|set]] of strings required for a particular purpose. A simple way to specify a finite set of strings is to list its [[Data element|elements]] or members. However, there are often more concise ways: for example, the set containing the three strings \"Handel\", \"H\u00e4ndel\", and \"Haendel\" can be specified by the pattern <code>H(\u00e4|ae?)ndel</code>; we say that this pattern ''matches'' each of the three strings. In most [[formalism (mathematics)|formalism]]s, if there exists at least one regular expression that matches a particular set then there exists an infinite number of other regular expressions that also match it\u2014the specification is not unique. Most formalisms provide the following operations to construct regular expressions.\n\n;Boolean \"or\"\n:A [[vertical bar]] separates alternatives. For example, {{code|lang=perl|code=gray{{!}}grey}} can match \"gray\" or \"grey\".\n;Grouping\n:[[Parentheses]] are used to define the scope and precedence of the [[Operator (programming)|operators]] (among other uses). For example, <code>gray|grey</code> and {{code|lang=perl|code=gr(a{{!}}e)y}} are equivalent patterns which both describe the set of \"gray\" or \"grey\".\n;Quantification\n:A [[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantifier]] after a [[Lexical analysis#Token|token]] (such as a character) or group specifies how often that a preceding element is allowed to occur. The most common quantifiers are the [[question mark]] <code>?</code>, the [[asterisk]] <code>*</code> (derived from the [[Kleene star]]), and the [[plus sign]] <code>+</code> ([[Kleene plus]]).\n:{|\n| style=\"width:15px; vertical-align:top;\" | <code>'''?'''</code>\n|The question mark indicates ''zero or one'' occurrences of the preceding element. For example, <code><!--DON'T CHANGE THIS TO \"colo?r\"! REGULAR EXPRESSIONS DON'T WORK LIKE WILDCARDS!--><!--Why not? Give reason in main context.!-->colou?r</code> matches both \"color\" and \"colour\".\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" | <code>'''<nowiki>*</nowiki>'''</code>\n|The asterisk indicates ''zero or more'' occurrences of the preceding element. For example, <code>ab*c</code> matches \"ac\", \"abc\", \"abbc\", \"abbbc\", and so on.\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" | <code>'''+'''</code>\n|The plus sign indicates ''one or more'' occurrences of the preceding element. For example, <code>ab+c</code> matches \"abc\", \"abbc\", \"abbbc\", and so on, but not \"ac\".\n|-\n|<code>'''{n}'''</code><ref name=\"grep\">grep(1) man page</ref>\n| The preceding item is matched exactly ''n'' times.\n|-\n|<code>'''{min,}'''</code><ref name=\"grep\"/>\n| The preceding item is matched ''min'' or more times.\n|-\n|<code>'''{min,max}'''</code><ref name=\"grep\"/>\n| The preceding item is matched at least ''min'' times, but not more than ''max'' times.\n|}\n;Wildcard\nThe wildcard <code>'''.'''</code> matches any character. For example, <code>a.b</code> matches any string that contains an \"a\", then any other character and then a \"b\", <code>a.*b</code> matches any string that contains an \"a\" and a \"b\" at some later point.\n\nThese constructions can be combined to form arbitrarily complex expressions, much like one can construct arithmetical expressions from numbers and the operations +, \u2212, \u00d7, and \u00f7. For example, <code>H(ae?|\u00e4)ndel</code> and {{code|lang=perl|code=H(a{{!}}ae{{!}}\u00e4)ndel}} are both valid patterns which match the same strings as the earlier example, <code>H(\u00e4|ae?)ndel</code>.\n\nThe precise [[syntax]] for regular expressions varies among tools and with context; more detail is given in {{slink||Syntax}}.\n\n==Formal language theory==\nRegular expressions describe [[regular language]]s in [[Formal language|formal language theory]]. They have the same expressive power as [[regular grammar]]s.\n\n===Formal definition===\nRegular expressions consist of constants, which denote sets of strings, and operator symbols, which denote operations over these sets. The following definition is standard, and found as such in most textbooks on formal language theory.<ref name=\"HopcroftMotwaniUllman01\">{{harvtxt|Hopcroft|Motwani|Ullman|2000}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Sipser|1998}}</ref> Given a finite [[alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]] \u03a3, the following constants are defined\nas regular expressions:\n*(''empty set'') \u2205 denoting the set \u2205.\n*(''[[empty string]]'') \u03b5 denoting the set containing only the \"empty\" string, which has no characters at all.\n*(''[[string literal|literal character]]'') <code>a</code> in \u03a3 denoting the set containing only the character ''a''.\n\nGiven regular expressions R and S, the following operations over them are defined\nto produce regular expressions:\n* (''[[concatenation]]'') ''RS'' denotes the set of strings that can be obtained by concatenating a string in R and a string in S. For example, let R = {\"ab\", \"c\"}, and S = {\"d\", \"ef\"}. Then, RS = {\"abd\", \"abef\", \"cd\", \"cef\"}.\n*(''[[alternation (formal language theory)|alternation]]'') ''R'' | ''S'' denotes the [[set union]] of sets described by ''R'' and ''S''. For example, if R describes {\"ab\", \"c\"} and S describes {\"ab\", \"d\", \"ef\"}, expression ''R'' | ''S'' describes {\"ab\", \"c\", \"d\", \"ef\"}.\n*(''[[Kleene star]]'') ''R''* denotes the smallest [[subset|superset]] of the set described by ''R'' that contains \u03b5 and is [[Closure (mathematics)|closed]] under string concatenation. This is the set of all strings that can be made by concatenating any finite number (including zero) of strings from the set described by ''R''. For example, {\"0\",\"1\"}* is the set of all finite [[binary string]]s (including the empty string), and {\"ab\", \"c\"}* = {\u03b5, \"ab\", \"c\", \"abab\", \"abc\", \"cab\", \"cc\", \"ababab\", \"abcab\", ... }.\n\nTo avoid parentheses it is assumed that the Kleene star has the highest priority, then concatenation and then alternation. If there is no ambiguity then parentheses may be omitted. For example, <code>(ab)c</code> can be written as <code>abc</code>, and <code>a|(b(c*))</code> can be written as <code>a|bc*</code>.\nMany textbooks use the symbols \u222a, +, or \u2228 for alternation instead of the vertical bar.\n\n'''Examples:'''\n*<code>a|b*</code> denotes {\u03b5, \"a\", \"b\", \"bb\", \"bbb\", ...}\n*<code>(a|b)*</code> denotes the set of all strings with no symbols other than \"a\" and \"b\", including the empty string: {\u03b5, \"a\", \"b\", \"aa\", \"ab\", \"ba\", \"bb\", \"aaa\", ...}\n*<code>ab*(c|\u03b5)</code> denotes the set of strings starting with \"a\", then zero or more \"b\"s and finally optionally a \"c\": {\"a\", \"ac\", \"ab\", \"abc\", \"abb\", \"abbc\", ...}\n*<code>(0|(1(01*0)*1))*</code> denotes the set of binary numbers that are multiples of 3: { \u03b5, \"0\", \"00\", \"11\", \"000\", \"011\", \"110\", \"0000\", \"0011\", \"0110\", \"1001\", \"1100\", \"1111\", \"00000\", ... }\n\n===Expressive power and compactness===\nThe formal definition of regular expressions is minimal on purpose, and avoids defining <code>?</code> and <code>+</code>\u2014these can be expressed as follows: <code>a+</code> = <code>aa*</code>, and <code>a?</code> = <code>(a|\u03b5)</code>. Sometimes the [[set complement|complement]] operator is added, to give a ''generalized regular expression''; here ''R<sup>c</sup>'' matches all strings over \u03a3* that do not match ''R''. In principle, the complement operator is redundant, because it doesn't grant any more expressive power. However, it can make a regular expression much more concise\u2014eliminating all complement operators from a regular expression can cause a [[Double exponential function|double exponentially]] blow-up of its length.<ref>{{harvtxt|Gelade|Neven|2008}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Gruber|Holzer|2008}}</ref>\n\nRegular expressions in this sense can express the regular languages, exactly the class of languages accepted by [[deterministic finite automata]]. There is, however, a significant difference in compactness. Some classes of regular languages can only be described by deterministic finite automata whose size grows [[exponential growth|exponentially]] in the size of the shortest equivalent regular expressions. The standard example here is the languages\n''L<sub>k</sub>'' consisting of all strings over the alphabet {''a'',''b''} whose ''k''<sup>th</sup>-from-last letter equals&nbsp;''a''. On one hand, a regular expression describing ''L''<sub>4</sub> is given by\n<math>(a\\mid b)^*a(a\\mid b)(a\\mid b)(a\\mid b)</math>.\n\nGeneralizing this pattern to ''L<sub>k</sub>'' gives the expression:\n<math>(a\\mid b)^*a\\underbrace{(a\\mid b)(a\\mid b)\\cdots(a\\mid b)}_{k-1\\text{ times}}. \\, </math>\n\nOn the other hand, it is known that every deterministic finite automaton accepting the language ''L<sub>k</sub>'' must have at least 2<sup>''k''</sup> states. Luckily, there is a simple mapping from regular expressions to the more general [[nondeterministic finite automata]] (NFAs) that does not lead to such a blowup in size; for this reason NFAs are often used as alternative representations of regular languages. NFAs are a simple variation of the type-3 [[formal grammar|grammars]] of the [[Chomsky hierarchy]].<ref name=\"HopcroftMotwaniUllman01\"/>\n\nIn the opposite direction, there are many languages easily described by a DFA that are not easily described a regular expression. For instance, determining the validity of a given [[ISBN]] requires computing the modulus of the integer base 11, and can be easily implemented with an 11-state DFA. However, a regular expression to answer the same problem of divisibility by 11 is at least multiple megabytes in length.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nGiven a regular expression, [[Thompson's construction algorithm]] computes an equivalent nondeterministic finite automaton. A conversion in the opposite direction is achieved by [[Kleene's algorithm]].\n\nFinally, it is worth noting that many real-world \"regular expression\" engines implement features that cannot be described by the regular expressions in the sense of formal language theory; rather, they implement ''regexes''. See [[#Patterns for non-regular languages|below]] for more on this.\n\n===Deciding equivalence of regular expressions===\nAs seen in many of the examples above, there is more than one way to construct a regular expression to achieve the same results.\n\nIt is possible to write an [[algorithm]] that, for two given regular expressions, decides whether the described languages are equal; the algorithm reduces each expression to a [[minimal deterministic finite state machine]], and determines whether they are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] (equivalent).\n\nAlgebraic laws for regular expressions can be obtained using a method by Gischer which is best explained along an example: In order to check whether (''X''+''Y'')<sup>*</sup> and (''X''<sup>*</sup> ''Y''<sup>*</sup>)<sup>*</sup> denote the same regular language, for all regular expressions ''X'', ''Y'', it is necessary and sufficient to check whether the particular regular expressions (''a''+''b'')<sup>*</sup> and (''a''<sup>*</sup> ''b''<sup>*</sup>)<sup>*</sup> denote the same language over the alphabet \u03a3={''a'',''b''}. More generally, an equation ''E''=''F'' between regular-expression terms with variables holds if, and only if, its instantiation with different variables replaced by different symbol constants holds.<ref>{{cite report | url= | author=Jay L.

The simplest atom is a literal, but grouping parts of the pattern to match an atom will require using <code>(&nbsp;)</code> as metacharacters. Metacharacters help form: ''atoms''; ''quantifiers'' telling how many atoms (and whether it is a [[#Lazy_matching|''greedy'' quantifier]] or not); a logical OR character, which offers a set of alternatives, and a logical NOT character, which negates an atom's existence; and backreferences to refer to previous atoms of a completing pattern of atoms. A match is made, not when all the atoms of the string are matched, but rather when all the pattern atoms in the regex have matched. The idea is to make a small pattern of characters stand for a large number of possible strings, rather than compiling a large list of all the literal possibilities.\n\nDepending on the regex processor there are about fourteen metacharacters, characters that may or may not have their [[literal (computer programming)|literal]] character meaning, depending on context, or whether they are \"escaped\", i.e. preceded by an [[escape sequence]], in this case, the backslash <code>\\</code>. Modern and POSIX extended regexes use metacharacters more often than their literal meaning, so to avoid \"backslash-osis\" or [[leaning toothpick syndrome]] it makes sense to have a metacharacter escape to a literal mode; but starting out, it makes more sense to have the four bracketing metacharacters <code>(&nbsp;)</code> and <code>{&nbsp;}</code> be primarily literal, and \"escape\" this usual meaning to become metacharacters. Common standards implement both. The usual metacharacters are <code> {}[]()^$.|*+?</code> and <code>\\</code>. The usual characters that become metacharacters when escaped are <code>dswDSW</code> and <code>N</code>.\n\n===Delimiters===\nWhen entering a regex in a programming language, they may be represented as a usual string literal, hence usually quoted; this is common in C, Java, and Python for instance, where the regex <code>re</code> is entered as <code>\"re\"</code>. However, they are often written with slashes as [[delimiter]]s, as in <code>/re/</code> for the regex <code>re</code>. This originates in [[Ed (text editor)|ed]], where <code>/</code> is the editor command for searching, and an expression <code>/re/</code> can be used to specify a range of lines (matching the pattern), which can be combined with other commands on either side, most famously <code>g/re/p</code> as in [[grep]] (\"global regex print\"), which is included in most [[Unix]]-based operating systems, such as [[Linux]] distributions. A similar convention is used in [[sed]], where search and replace is given by <code>s/re/replacement/</code> and patterns can be joined with a comma to specify a range of lines as in <code>/re1/,/re2/</code>. This notation is particularly well known due to its use in [[Perl]], where it forms part of the syntax distinct from normal string literals. In some cases, such as sed and Perl, alternative delimiters can be used to avoid collision with contents, and to avoid having to escape occurrences of the delimiter character in the contents. For example, in sed the command <code>s,/,X,</code> will replace a <code>/</code> with an <code>X</code>, using commas as delimiters.\n\n===Standards===\n{{anchor|POSIX}}The [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] [[POSIX]] standard has three sets of compliance: '''BRE''' (Basic Regular Expressions),<ref>ISO/IEC 9945-2:1993 ''Information technology \u2013 Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) \u2013 Part 2: Shell and Utilities'', successively revised as ISO/IEC 9945-2:2002 ''Information technology \u2013 Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) \u2013 Part 2: System Interfaces'', ISO/IEC 9945-2:2003, and currently ISO/IEC/IEEE 9945:2009 ''Information technology \u2013 Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX\u00ae) Base Specifications, Issue 7''</ref> '''ERE''' (Extended Regular Expressions), and '''SRE''' (Simple Regular Expressions). SRE is [[Deprecation|deprecated]],<ref>The Single Unix Specification (Version 2)</ref> in favor of BRE, as both provide [[backward compatibility]]. The subsection below covering the ''character classes'' applies to both BRE and ERE.\n\nBRE and ERE work together. ERE adds <code>?</code>, <code>+</code>, and <code>|</code>, and it removes the need to escape the metacharacters <code>(&nbsp;)</code> and <code>{&nbsp;}</code>, which are ''required'' in BRE. Furthermore, as long as the POSIX standard syntax for regexes is adhered to, there can be, and often is, additional syntax to serve specific (yet POSIX compliant) applications. Although POSIX.2 leaves some implementation specifics undefined, BRE and ERE provide a \"standard\" which has since been adopted as the default syntax of many tools, where the choice of BRE or ERE modes is usually a supported option. For example, [[GNU]] <code>grep</code> has the following options: \"<code>grep -E</code>\" for ERE, and \"<code>grep -G</code>\" for BRE (the default), and \"<code>grep -P</code>\" for [[Perl]] regexes.\n\nPerl regexes have become a de facto standard, having a rich and powerful set of atomic expressions. Perl has no \"basic\" or \"extended\" levels. As in POSIX EREs, <code>(&nbsp;)</code> and <code>{&nbsp;}</code> are treated as metacharacters unless escaped; other metacharacters are known to be literal or symbolic based on context alone. Additional functionality includes [[#Lazy matching|lazy matching]], [[backreferences]], named capture groups, and [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive]] patterns.\n\n====POSIX basic and extended====\nIn the [[POSIX]] standard, Basic Regular Syntax ('''BRE''') requires that the [[metacharacter]]s <code>(&nbsp;)</code> and <code>{&nbsp;}</code> be designated <code>\\(\\)</code> and <code>\\{\\}</code>, whereas Extended Regular Syntax ('''ERE''') does not.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Metacharacter\n! Description\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!<code>^</code>\n|Matches the starting position within the string. In line-based tools, it matches the starting position of any line.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!<code>.</code>\n|Matches any single character (many applications exclude [[newline]]s, and exactly which characters are considered newlines is flavor-, character-encoding-, and platform-specific, but it is safe to assume that the line feed character is included). Within POSIX bracket expressions, the dot character matches a literal dot. For example, <code>a.c</code> matches \"abc\", etc., but <code>[a.c]</code> matches only \"a\", \".\", or \"c\".\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!<code>[&nbsp;]</code>\n|A bracket expression. Matches a single character that is contained within the brackets. For example, <code>[abc]</code> matches \"a\", \"b\", or \"c\". <code>[a-z]</code> specifies a range which matches any lowercase letter from \"a\" to \"z\". These forms can be mixed: <code>[abcx-z]</code> matches \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"x\", \"y\", or \"z\", as does <code>[a-cx-z]</code>.\nThe <code>-</code> character is treated as a literal character if it is the last or the first (after the <code>^</code>, if present) character within the brackets: <code>[abc-]</code>, <code>[-abc]</code>. Note that backslash escapes are not allowed. The <code>]</code> character can be included in a bracket expression if it is the first (after the <code>^</code>) character: <code>[]abc]</code>.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!<code>[^&nbsp;]</code>\n|Matches a single character that is not contained within the brackets. For example, <code>[^abc]</code> matches any character other than \"a\", \"b\", or \"c\". <code>[^a-z]</code> matches any single character that is not a lowercase letter from \"a\" to \"z\". Likewise, literal characters and ranges can be mixed.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!<code>$</code>\n|Matches the ending position of the string or the position just before a string-ending newline. In line-based tools, it matches the ending position of any line.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!<code>( )</code>\n|Defines a marked subexpression. The string matched within the parentheses can be recalled later (see the next entry, <code>\\''n''</code>). A marked subexpression is also called a block or capturing group. '''BRE mode requires {{nowrap|<code>\\(&nbsp;\\)</code>}}'''.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!<code>\\''n''</code>\n|Matches what the ''n''th marked subexpression matched, where ''n'' is a digit from 1 to 9. This construct is vaguely defined in the POSIX.2 standard. Some tools allow referencing more than nine capturing groups. Also known as a backreference.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!<code>*</code>\n|Matches the preceding element zero or more times. For example, <code>ab*c</code> matches \"ac\", \"abc\", \"abbbc\", etc. <code>[xyz]*</code> matches \"\", \"x\", \"y\", \"z\", \"zx\", \"zyx\", \"xyzzy\", and so on. <code>(ab)*</code> matches \"\", \"ab\", \"abab\", \"ababab\", and so on.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!{{nowrap|<code>{''m'',''n''}</code>}}\n|Matches the preceding element at least ''m'' and not more than ''n'' times. For example, <code>a{3,5}</code> matches only \"aaa\", \"aaaa\", and \"aaaaa\". This is not found in a few older instances of regexes. '''BRE mode requires <code>{{nowrap|\\{''m'',''n''\\}}}</code>'''.\n\n|}\n\n'''Examples:'''\n*<code>.at</code> matches any three-character string ending with \"at\", including \"hat\", \"cat\", and \"bat\".\n*<code>[hc]at</code> matches \"hat\" and \"cat\".\n*<code>[^b]at</code> matches all strings matched by <code>.at</code> except \"bat\".\n*<code>[^hc]at</code> matches all strings matched by <code>.at</code> other than \"hat\" and \"cat\".\n*<code>^[hc]at</code> matches \"hat\" and \"cat\", but only at the beginning of the string or line.\n*<code>[hc]at$</code> matches \"hat\" and \"cat\", but only at the end of the string or line.\n*<code>\\[.\\]</code> matches any single character surrounded by \"[\" and \"]\" since the brackets are escaped, for example: \"[a]\" and \"[b]\".\n*<code>s.*</code> matches s followed by zero or more characters, for example: \"s\" and \"saw\" and \"seed\".\n\n====POSIX extended====\nThe meaning of metacharacters [[escape character|escaped]] with a backslash is reversed for some characters in the POSIX Extended Regular Expression ('''ERE''') syntax. With this syntax, a backslash causes the metacharacter to be treated as a literal character. So, for example, <code>\\(&nbsp;\\)</code> is now <code>(&nbsp;)</code> and <code>\\{&nbsp;\\}</code> is now <code>{&nbsp;}</code>. Additionally, support is removed for <code>\\''n''</code> backreferences and the following metacharacters are added:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Metacharacter\n! Description\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!<code>?</code>\n|Matches the preceding element zero or one time. For example, <code>ab?c</code> matches only \"ac\" or \"abc\".\n|-\n!<code>+</code>\n|Matches the preceding element one or more times. For example, <code>ab+c</code> matches \"abc\", \"abbc\", \"abbbc\", and so on, but not \"ac\".\n|-\n!<code><nowiki>|</nowiki></code>\n|The choice (also known as alternation or set union) operator matches either the expression before or the expression after the operator. For example, <code><nowiki>abc|def</nowiki></code> matches \"abc\" or \"def\".</td>\n|}\n\n'''Examples:'''\n*<code>[hc]?at</code> matches \"at\", \"hat\", and \"cat\".\n*<code>[hc]*at</code> matches \"at\", \"hat\", \"cat\", \"hhat\", \"chat\", \"hcat\", \"cchchat\", and so on.\n*<code>[hc]+at</code> matches \"hat\", \"cat\", \"hhat\", \"chat\", \"hcat\", \"cchchat\", and so on, but not \"at\".\n*<code>cat|dog</code> matches \"cat\" or \"dog\".\n\nPOSIX Extended Regular Expressions can often be used with modern Unix utilities by including the [[command line]] flag <var>-E</var>.\n\n====Character classes====\nThe character class is the most basic regex concept after a literal match. It makes one small sequence of characters match a larger set of characters. For example, <source lang=\"ragel\" inline>[A-Z]</source> could stand for the uppercase alphabet in the English language, and <source lang=\"ragel\" inline>\\d</source> could mean any digit. Character classes apply to both POSIX levels.\n\nWhen specifying a range of characters, such as <source lang=\"ragel\" inline>[a-Z]</source> (i.e. lowercase ''<source lang=\"ragel\" inline>a</source>'' to uppercase ''<source lang=\"ragel\" inline>Z</source>''), the computer's locale settings determine the contents by the numeric ordering of the character encoding. They could store digits in that sequence, or the ordering could be ''abc\u2026zABC\u2026Z'', or ''aAbBcC\u2026zZ''. So the POSIX standard defines a character class, which will be known by the regex processor installed. Those definitions are in the following table:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! POSIX !!

For example, <source lang=\"ragel\" inline>[[:upper:]ab]</source> matches the uppercase letters and lowercase \"a\" and \"b\".\n\nAn additional non-POSIX class understood by some tools is <source lang=\"ragel\" inline>[:word:]</source>, which is usually defined as <source lang=\"ragel\" inline>[:alnum:]</source> plus underscore. This reflects the fact that in many programming languages these are the characters that may be used in identifiers. The editor [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]] further distinguishes ''word'' and ''word-head'' classes (using the notation <source lang=\"ragel\" inline>\\w</source> and <source lang=\"ragel\" inline>\\h</source>) since in many programming languages the characters that can begin an identifier are not the same as those that can occur in other positions: numbers are generally excluded, so an identifier would look like <source lang=\"ragel\" inline>\\h\\w*</source> or <source lang=\"ragel\" inline>[[:alpha:]_][[:alnum:]_]*</source> in POSIX notation.\n\nNote that what the POSIX regex standards call ''character classes'' are commonly referred to as ''POSIX character classes'' in other regex flavors which support them. With most other regex flavors, the term ''character class'' is used to describe what POSIX calls ''bracket expressions''.\n\n===Perl and PCRE===\n{{See also|Perl Compatible Regular Expressions}}\nBecause of its expressive power and (relative) ease of reading, many other utilities and programming languages have adopted syntax similar to [[Perl]]'s &mdash; for example, [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[JavaScript]], [[Julia (programming language)|Julia]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[Qt (software)|Qt]], Microsoft's [[.NET Framework]], and [[XML Schema (W3C)|XML Schema]]. Some languages and tools such as [[Boost C++ Libraries|Boost]] and [[PHP]] support multiple regex flavors. Perl-derivative regex implementations are not identical and usually implement a subset of features found in Perl 5.0, released in 1994. Perl sometimes does incorporate features initially found in other languages. For example, Perl 5.10 implements syntactic extensions originally developed in PCRE and Python.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html#PCRE%2fPython-Support | title= Perl Regular Expression Documentation |publisher=perldoc.perl.org | accessdate=January 8, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Lazy matching===\nIn Python and some<!---should be 'many', or 'most', or 'a few', or ...?---> other implementations (e.g. Java), the three common quantifiers (<code>*</code>, <code>+</code> and <code>?</code>) are [[greedy algorithm|greedy]] by default because they match as many characters as possible.<ref name=py-re>{{cite web|title=Regular Expression Syntax|url=https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax|website=Python 3.5.0 documentation|publisher=[[Python Software Foundation]]|accessdate=10 October 2015}}</ref> The regex <code>\".+\"</code> (including the double-quotes) applied to the string\n\n \"Ganymede,\" he continued, \"is the largest moon in the Solar System.\"\n\nmatches the entire line (because the entire line begins and ends with a double-quote) instead of matching only the first part, <code>\"Ganymede,\"</code>. The aforementioned quantifiers may, however, be made ''lazy'' or ''minimal'' or ''reluctant'', matching as few characters as possible, by appending a question mark: <code>\".+?\"</code> matches only <code>\"Ganymede,\"</code>.<ref name=py-re/>\n\nHowever, the whole sentence can still be matched in some circumstances. The question-mark operator does not change the meaning of the dot operator, so this still can match the double-quotes in the input. A pattern like <code>\".*?\" EOF</code> will still match the whole input if this is the string:\n\n \"Ganymede,\" he continued, \"is the largest moon in the Solar System.\" EOF\n\nTo ensure that the double-quotes cannot be part of the match, the dot has to be replaced, e. g. like this: <code>\"[^\"]*\"</code> This will match a quoted text part without additional double-quotes in it. (By removing possibilities for a fixed suffix to be matched, one also transforms the lazy-match to a greedy-match.)\n\n===Possessive matching===\nIn Java, quantifiers may be made ''possessive'' by appending a plus sign, which disables backing off (in a backtracking engine), even if doing so would allow the overall match to succeed:<ref name=es-re>{{cite web|title=Essential classes: Regular Expressions: Quantifiers: Differences Among Greedy, Reluctant, and Possessive Quantifiers|url=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/regex/quant.html#difs|website=The Java Tutorials|publisher=[[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]|accessdate=23 December 2016}}</ref> While the regex <code>\".*\"</code> applied to the string\n\n \"Ganymede,\" he continued, \"is the largest moon in the Solar System.\"\n\nmatches the entire line, the regex <code>\".*+\"</code> does {{em|not match at all}}, because <code>.*+</code> consumes the entire input, including the final <code>\"</code>. Thus, possessive quantifiers are most useful with negated character classes, e.g. <code>\"[^\"]*+\"</code>, which matches <code>\"Ganymede,\"</code> when applied to the same string.\n\nAnother common extension serving the same function is atomic grouping, which disables backtracking for a parenthesized group. The typical syntax is {{mono|1=(?&gt;group)}}. For example, while {{mono|1=^(wi{{!}}w)i$}} matches both {{mono|wi}} and {{mono|wii}}, {{mono|1=^(?&gt;wi{{!}}w)i$}} only matches {{mono|wii}} because the engine is forbidden from backtracking and try with setting the group as \"w\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Atomic Grouping |url=https://www.regular-expressions.info/atomic.html |website=Regex Tutorial |accessdate=24 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nPossessive quantifiers are easier to implement than greedy and lazy quantifiers, and are typically more efficient at runtime.<ref name=es-re/>\n\n==Patterns for non-regular languages==\nMany features found in virtually all modern regular expression libraries provide an expressive power that far exceeds the [[regular language]]s. For example, many implementations allow grouping subexpressions with parentheses and recalling the value they match in the same expression (''{{visible anchor|backreferences}}''). This means that, among other things, a pattern can match strings of repeated words like \"papa\" or \"WikiWiki\", called ''squares'' in formal language theory. The pattern for these strings is <code>(.+)\\1</code>.\n\nThe language of squares is not regular, nor is it [[context-free language|context-free]], due to the [[Pumping lemma for context-free languages|pumping lemma]]. However, [[pattern matching]] with an unbounded number of backreferences, as supported by numerous modern tools, is still [[context-sensitive language|context sensitive]].<ref>{{cite journal | author=Cezar C\u00e2mpeanu and Kai Salomaa, and Sheng Yu | title=A Formal Study of Practical Regular Expressions | journal=International Journal of Foundations of Computer Science | volume=14 | number=6 | pages=1007\u20131018 | url=http://137.149.157.5/Articles/index.php?aid=1<!---This url was taken from C\u00e2mpeanu's publications page http://www.csit.upei.ca/~ccampeanu/Research/RJ--->| date=Dec 2003 | doi=10.1142/S012905410300214X }} Theorem 3 (p.9)</ref> The general problem of matching any number of backreferences is [[NP-complete]], growing exponentially by the number of backref groups used.<ref>{{cite web |title=Perl Regular Expression Matching is NP-Hard |url=https://perl.plover.com/NPC/ |website=perl.plover.com}}</ref>\n\nHowever, many tools, libraries, and engines that provide such constructions still use the term ''regular expression'' for their patterns. This has led to a nomenclature where the term regular expression has different meanings in [[formal language|formal language theory]] and pattern matching. For this reason, some people have taken to using the term ''regex'', ''regexp'', or simply ''pattern'' to describe the latter. [[Larry Wall]], author of the Perl programming language, writes in an essay about the design of Raku:\n\n{{bq|1=\"Regular expressions\" [\u2026] are only marginally related to real regular expressions. Nevertheless, the term has grown with the capabilities of our pattern matching engines, so I'm not going to try to fight linguistic necessity here. I will, however, generally call them \"regexes\" (or \"regexen\", when I'm in an Anglo-Saxon mood).<ref name=\"Apocalypse5\"/>}}\n\nOther features not found in describing regular languages include assertions. These include the ubiquitous {{mono|^}} and {{mono|$}}, as well as some more sophiscated extensions like lookaround. They define the surrounding of a match and don't spill into the match itself, a feature only relevant for the use-case of string searching. Some of them can be simulated in a regular language by treating the surroundings as a part of the language as well.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wandering Logic |title=How to simulate lookaheads and lookbehinds in finite state automata? |url=https://cs.stackexchange.com/a/40058 |website=Computer Science Stack Exchange |accessdate=24 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|Implementations}}Implementations and running times==\nThere are at least three different [[algorithm]]s that decide whether and how a given regex matches a string.\n\nThe oldest and fastest relies on a result in formal language theory that allows every [[nondeterministic finite automaton]] (NFA) to be transformed into a [[deterministic finite automaton]] (DFA). The DFA can be constructed explicitly and then run on the resulting input string one symbol at a time. Constructing the DFA for a regular expression of size ''m'' has the time and memory cost of [[Big O notation|''O'']](2<sup>''m''</sup>), but it can be run on a string of size ''n'' in time ''O''(''n'').  Note that the size of the expression is the size after abbreviations, such as numeric quantifiers, have been expanded.\n\nAn alternative approach is to simulate the NFA directly, essentially building each DFA state on demand and then discarding it at the next step. This keeps the DFA implicit and avoids the exponential construction cost, but running cost rises to ''O''(''mn''). The explicit approach is called the DFA algorithm and the implicit approach the NFA algorithm. Adding caching to the NFA algorithm is often called the \"lazy DFA\" algorithm, or just the DFA algorithm without making a distinction. These algorithms are fast, but using them for recalling grouped subexpressions, lazy quantification, and similar features is tricky.<ref>{{harvtxt|Cox|2007}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Laurikari|2009}}</ref> Modern implementations include the re1-re2-sregex family based on Cox's code.\n\nThe third algorithm is to match the pattern against the input string by [[backtracking]]. This algorithm is commonly called NFA, but this terminology can be confusing. Its running time can be exponential, which simple implementations exhibit when matching against expressions like {{code|lang=perl|code=(a{{!}}aa)*b}} that contain both alternation and unbounded quantification and force the algorithm to consider an exponentially increasing number of sub-cases. This behavior can cause a security problem called [[Regular expression Denial of Service]] (ReDoS).\n\nAlthough backtracking implementations only give an exponential guarantee in the worst case, they provide much greater flexibility and expressive power. For example, any implementation which allows the use of backreferences, or implements the various extensions introduced by Perl, must include some kind of backtracking. Some implementations try to provide the best of both algorithms by first running a fast DFA algorithm, and revert to a potentially slower backtracking algorithm only when a backreference is encountered during the match. GNU grep (and the underlying gnulib DFA) uses such a strategy.<ref>{{cite web |title=gnulib/lib/dfa.c |url=https://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=gnulib.git;a=blob;f=lib/dfa.c |quote=If the scanner detects a transition on backref, it returns a kind of \"semi-success\" indicating that the match will have to be verified with a backtracking matcher.}}</ref>\n\nSublinear runtime algorithms have been achieved using [[Boyer\u2013Moore string-search algorithm|Boyer-Moore (BM) based algorithms]] and related DFA optimization techniques such as the reverse scan.<ref>{{cite arXiv |last=Kearns |first=Steven |eprint=1308.3822 |title=Sublinear Matching With Finite Automata Using Reverse Suffix Scanning |date=August 2013}}</ref> GNU grep, which supports a wide variety of POSIX syntaxes and extensions, uses BM for a first-pass prefiltering, and then uses an implicit DFA.

In terms of historical implementations, regexes were originally written to use [[American Standard Code for Information Interchange|ASCII]] characters as their token set though regex libraries have supported numerous other [[character set]]s. Many modern regex engines offer at least some support for [[Unicode]]. In most respects it makes no difference what the character set is, but some issues do arise when extending regexes to support Unicode.\n\n* '''Supported encoding'''. Some regex libraries expect to work on some particular encoding instead of on abstract Unicode characters. Many of these require the [[UTF-8]] encoding, while others might expect [[UTF-16]], or [[UTF-32]]. In contrast, Perl and Java are agnostic on encodings, instead operating on decoded characters internally.\n* '''Supported Unicode range'''. Many regex engines support only the [[Basic Multilingual Plane]], that is, the characters which can be encoded with only 16 bits. Currently (as of 2016) only a few regex engines (e.g., Perl's and Java's) can handle the full 21-bit Unicode range.\n* '''Extending ASCII-oriented constructs to Unicode'''. For example, in ASCII-based implementations, character ranges of the form <code>[x-y]</code> are valid wherever ''x'' and ''y'' have [[code point]]s in the range [0x00,0x7F] and codepoint(''x'') \u2264 codepoint(''y''). The natural extension of such character ranges to Unicode would simply change the requirement that the endpoints lie in [0x00,0x7F] to the requirement that they lie in [0x0000,0x10FFFF]. However, in practice this is often not the case. Some implementations, such as that of [[Gawk (GNU package)|gawk]], do not allow character ranges to cross Unicode blocks. A range like [0x61,0x7F] is valid since both endpoints fall within the Basic Latin block, as is [0x0530,0x0560] since both endpoints fall within the Armenian block, but a range like [0x0061,0x0532] is invalid since it includes multiple Unicode blocks. Other engines, such as that of the [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]] editor, allow block-crossing but the character values must not be more than 256 apart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/pattern.html#/%5B%5D |title=Vim documentation: pattern |publisher=Vimdoc.sourceforge.net |accessdate=2013-09-25}}</ref>\n* '''Case insensitivity'''. Some case-insensitivity flags affect only the ASCII characters. Other flags affect all characters. Some engines have two different flags, one for ASCII, the other for Unicode. Exactly which characters belong to the POSIX classes also varies.\n* '''Cousins of case insensitivity'''. As ASCII has case distinction, case insensitivity became a logical feature in text searching. Unicode introduced alphabetic scripts without case like [[Devan\u0101gar\u012b|Devanagari]]. For these, [[case sensitivity]] is not applicable. For scripts like Chinese, another distinction seems logical: between traditional and simplified. In Arabic scripts, insensitivity to [[IMFI|initial, medial, final, and isolated position]] may be desired. In Japanese, insensitivity between [[hiragana]] and [[katakana]] is sometimes useful.\n* '''Normalization'''. Unicode has [[Unicode#Combining characters|combining characters]]. Like old typewriters, plain letters can be followed by one or more non-spacing symbols (usually diacritics like accent marks) to form a single printing character, but also provides precomposed characters, i.e. characters that already include one or more combining characters. A sequence of a character + combining character should be matched with the identical single precomposed character. The process of standardizing sequences of characters + combining characters is called normalization.\n* '''New control codes'''. Unicode introduced amongst others, [[byte order mark]]s and text direction markers. These codes might have to be dealt with in a special way.\n* '''Introduction of character classes for Unicode blocks, scripts, and numerous other character properties'''. Block properties are much less useful than script properties, because a block can have code points from several different scripts, and a script can have code points from several different blocks.<ref name=\"unicode\">{{cite web\n| title = UTS#18 on Unicode Regular Expressions, Annex A: Character Blocks\n| url = http://unicode.org/reports/tr18/#Character_Blocks\n| accessdate = 2010-02-05}}</ref> In [[Perl]] and the {{Javadoc:SE|package=java.util.regex|java/util/regex}} library, properties of the form <code>\\p{InX}</code> or <code>\\p{Block=X}</code> match characters in block ''X'' and <code>\\P{InX}</code> or <code>\\P{Block=X}</code> matches code points not in that block. Similarly, <code>\\p{Armenian}</code>, <code>\\p{IsArmenian}</code>, or <code>\\p{Script=Armenian}</code> matches any character in the Armenian script. In general, <code>\\p{X}</code> matches any character with either the binary property ''X'' or the general category ''X''. For example, <code>\\p{Lu}</code>, <code>\\p{Uppercase_Letter}</code>, or <code>\\p{GC=Lu}</code> matches any uppercase letter. Binary properties that are ''not'' general categories include <code>\\p{White_Space}</code>, <code>\\p{Alphabetic}</code>, <code>\\p{Math}</code>, and <code>\\p{Dash}</code>. Examples of non-binary properties are <code>\\p{Bidi_Class=Right_to_Left}</code>, <code>\\p{Word_Break=A_Letter}</code>, and <code>\\p{Numeric_Value=10}</code>.\n\n==Uses==\nRegexes are useful in a wide variety of [[text processing]] tasks, and more generally [[string processing]], where the data need not be textual. Common applications include [[data validation]], [[data scraping]] (especially [[web scraping]]), [[data wrangling]], simple [[parsing]], the production of [[syntax highlighting]] systems, and many other tasks.\n\nWhile regexes would be useful on Internet [[Search engine (computing)|search engine]]s, processing them across the entire database could consume excessive computer resources depending on the complexity and design of the regex. Although in many cases system administrators can run regex-based queries internally, most search engines do not offer regex support to the public. Notable exceptions: [[Google Code Search]], [[Exalead]]. Google Code Search has been shut down as of January 2012.<ref>{{cite web |first=Bradley |last=Horowitz |author-link=Bradley Horowitz |url=https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/10/fall-sweep.html |title=A fall sweep |date=24 October 2011 |access-date=4 May 2019 |work=[[Google Blog]]}}</ref>\nIt used a trigram index to speed queries.<ref>{{cite web |last=Cox |first=Russ |date=January 2012 |url=https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp4.html |title=Regular Expression Matching with a Trigram Index, or How Google Code Search Worked |access-date=4 May 2019 |work=swtch.com}}</ref>\n\n==Examples==\nThe specific syntax rules vary depending on the specific implementation, [[programming language]], or [[Library (computing)|library]] in use. Additionally, the functionality of regex implementations can vary between [[Software versioning|version]]s.\n\nBecause regexes can be difficult to both explain and understand without examples, interactive websites for testing regexes are a useful resource for learning regexes by experimentation.\nThis section provides a basic description of some of the properties of regexes by way of illustration.\n\nThe following conventions are used in the examples.<ref name=\"clarify000\">The character 'm' is not always required to specify a [[Perl]] match operation. For example, <code>m/[^abc]/</code> could also be rendered as <code>/[^abc]/</code>. The 'm' is only necessary if the user wishes to specify a match operation without using a forward-slash as the regex [[delimiter]]. Sometimes it is useful to specify an alternate regex delimiter in order to avoid \"[[delimiter collision]]\". See '[http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html perldoc perlre]' for more details.</ref>\n\n metacharacter(s) ;; the metacharacters column specifies the regex syntax being demonstrated\n =~ m//           ;; indicates a regex '''match''' operation in Perl\n =~ s///          ;; indicates a regex '''substitution''' operation in Perl\n\nAlso worth noting is that these regexes are all Perl-like syntax. Standard [[#POSIX Basic Regular Expressions|POSIX]] regular expressions are different.\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, the following examples conform to the [[Perl]] programming language, release 5.8.8, January 31, 2006. This means that other implementations may lack support for some parts of the syntax shown here (e.g. basic vs. extended regex, <code>\\( \\)</code> vs. <code>()</code>, or lack of <code>\\d</code> instead of [[POSIX]] <code>[:digit:]</code>).\n\nThe syntax and conventions used in these examples coincide with that of other programming environments as well.<ref>E.g., see ''[[Java (programming language)|Java]] [[O'Reilly Media#In a Nutshell|in a Nutshell]]'', p. 213; ''[[Python (programming language)|Python]] Scripting for Computational Science'', p. 320; Programming [[PHP]], p. 106.</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

This is known as the [[induction of regular languages]], and is part of the general problem of [[grammar induction]] in [[computational learning theory]]. Formally, given examples of strings in a regular language, and perhaps also given examples of strings ''not'' in that regular language, it is possible to induce a grammar for the language, i.e., a regular expression that generates that language. Not all regular languages can be induced in this way (see [[language identification in the limit]]), but many can.

Usually such patterns are used by [[string searching algorithm]]s for \"find\" or \"find and replace\" operations on [[String (computer science)|strings]], or for input validation. It is a technique developed in [[theoretical computer science]] and [[formal language]] theory.\n\nThe concept arose in the 1950s when the American mathematician [[Stephen Cole Kleene]] formalized the description of a ''[[regular language]]''. The concept came into common use with [[Unix]] text-processing utilities. Different [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntaxes]] for writing regular expressions have existed since the 1980s<!---introduction of POSIX and Perl--->, one being the [[POSIX]] standard and another, widely used, being the [[Perl]] syntax.\n\nRegular expressions are used in [[search engine]]s, search and replace dialogs of [[word processor]]s and [[text editor]]s, in text processing utilities such as [[sed]] and [[AWK]] and in [[lexical analysis]]. Many [[programming language]]s provide regex capabilities either built-in or via [[Library (computing)|libraries]].<!-- not too much info here. Put it into its own chapter--><!--, built-in (for example [[Perl language structure#Regular expressions|Perl]], [[JavaScript]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[AWK]], and [[Tcl]]) and others via a [[standard library]] (for example [[.NET Framework|.NET languages]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[C POSIX library#regex.h|POSIX C]], and [[C++]] since [[C++11#regex|C++11]]). Most other languages offer regexes via a library.-->\n\n==Patterns==\nThe phrase ''regular expressions'', also called ''regexes'', is often used to mean the specific, standard textual syntax for representing patterns for matching text, as distinct from the mathematical notation described below. Each character in a regular expression (that is, each character in the string describing its pattern) is either a [[metacharacter]], having a special meaning, or a regular character that has a literal meaning. For example, in the regex <code>a.</code>, ''a'' is a literal character which matches just 'a', while '.' is a metacharacter that matches every character except a newline. Therefore, this regex matches, for example, 'a ', or 'ax', or 'a0'. Together, metacharacters and literal characters can be used to identify text of a given pattern, or process a number of instances of it. Pattern matches may vary from a precise equality to a very general similarity, as controlled by the metacharacters. For example, <code>.</code> is a very general pattern, <code><nowiki>[a-z]</nowiki></code> (match all lower case letters from 'a' to 'z') is less general and <code>a</code> is a precise pattern (matches just 'a'). The metacharacter syntax is designed specifically to represent prescribed targets in a concise and flexible way to direct the automation of [[text processing]] of a variety of input data, in a form easy to type using a standard [[ASCII]] [[computer keyboard|keyboard]].\n\nA very simple case of a regular expression in this syntax is to locate a word spelled two different ways in a [[text editor]], the regular expression <code>seriali[sz]e</code> matches both \"serialise\" and \"serialize\". [[Wildcard character|Wildcards]] also achieve this, but are more limited in what they can pattern, as they have fewer metacharacters and a simple language-base.\n\nThe usual context of [[wildcard character]]s is in [[glob (programming)|globbing]] similar names in a list of files, whereas regexes are usually employed in applications that pattern-match text strings in general. For example, the regex <source lang=\"ragel\" inline>^[ \\t]+|[ \\t]+$</source> matches excess whitespace at the beginning or end of a line. An advanced regular expression that matches any numeral is <source lang=\"ragel\" inline>[+-]?(\\d+(\\.\\d+)?|\\.\\d+)([eE][+-]?\\d+)?</source>.\n\n[[File:Thompson-kleene-star.svg|right|thumb|[[Thompson's construction algorithm|Translating]] the [[Kleene star]]<br/>(''s''* means 'zero or more of ''s'' ')]]\nA '''regex processor''' translates a regular expression in the above syntax into an internal representation which can be executed and matched against a [[string (computing)|string]] representing the text being searched in. One possible approach is the [[Thompson's construction algorithm]] to construct a [[nondeterministic finite automaton]] (NFA), which is then [[Powerset construction|made deterministic]] and the resulting [[deterministic finite automaton]] (DFA) is run on the target text string to recognize substrings that match the regular expression.\nThe picture shows the NFA scheme <code>''N''(''s''*)</code> obtained from the regular expression <code>''s''*</code>, where ''s'' denotes a simpler regular expression in turn, which has already been [[Recursion (computer science)|recursively]] translated to the NFA ''N''(''s'').\n\n==History==\nRegular expressions originated in 1951, when mathematician [[Stephen Cole Kleene]] described [[regular language]]s using his mathematical notation called ''regular events''.{{sfn|Kleene|1951}}<ref name = \"Leung, New Mexico State University, 2010\" >{{ Cite web | url = https://www.cs.nmsu.edu/historical-projects/Projects/kleene.9.16.10.pdf | title = Regular Languages and Finite Automata | access-date = 13 August 2019 | first = Hing | last = Leung | date = 16 September 2010 | website = [[New Mexico State University]] | quote = The concept of regular events was introduced by Kleene via the definition of regular expressions. | format = pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131205193130/https://www.cs.nmsu.edu/historical-projects/Projects/kleene.9.16.10.pdf | archive-date = 5 December 2013  | df = dmy-all }}</ref> These arose in [[theoretical computer science]], in the subfields of [[automata theory]] (models of computation) and the description and classification of [[formal language]]s. Other early implementations of [[pattern matching]] include the [[SNOBOL]] language, which did not use regular expressions, but instead its own pattern matching constructs.\n\nRegular expressions entered popular use from 1968 in two uses: pattern matching in a text editor{{sfn|Thompson|1968}} and lexical analysis in a compiler.{{sfn|Johnson|Porter|Ackley|Ross|1968}} Among the first appearances of regular expressions in program form was when [[Ken Thompson]] built Kleene's notation into the editor [[QED (text editor)|QED]] as a means to match patterns in [[text file]]s.{{sfn|Thompson|1968}}<ref name=\"Beautiful Code Kernighan\">{{cite book | last1 = Kernighan | first1 = Brian | authorlink1 = Brian Kernighan | title = Beautiful Code | chapter = A Regular Expressions Matcher | publisher = [[O'Reilly Media]] | pages = 1\u20132 | chapter-url = http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr09/cos333/beautiful.html | accessdate = 2013-05-15 | isbn = 978-0-596-51004-6| date = 2007-08-08 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/dmr/qed.html |title=An incomplete history of the QED Text Editor |last1=Ritchie |first1=Dennis M. |publisher= |accessdate=9 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990221023422/http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/dmr/qed.html |archive-date=1999-02-21 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>{{sfn|Aho|Ullman|1992|loc=10.11 Bibliographic Notes for Chapter 10, p. 589}} For speed, Thompson implemented regular expression matching by [[just-in-time compilation]] (JIT) to [[IBM 7094]] code on the [[Compatible Time-Sharing System]], an important early example of JIT compilation.{{sfn|Aycock|2003|loc=2. JIT Compilation Techniques, 2.1 Genesis, p. 98}} He later added this capability to the Unix editor [[ed (text editor)|ed]], which eventually led to the popular search tool [[grep]]'s use of regular expressions (\"grep\" is a word derived from the command for regular expression searching in the ed editor: <code>g/''re''/p</code> meaning \"Global search for Regular Expression and Print matching lines\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://catb.org/jargon/html/G/grep.html | title=Jargon File 4.4.7: grep | author=[[Eric S.

Ross]] implemented a tool based on regular expressions that is used for [[lexical analysis]] in [[compiler]] design.{{sfn|Johnson|Porter|Ackley|Ross|1968}}\n\nMany variations of these original forms of regular expressions were used in [[Unix]]{{sfn|Aho|Ullman|1992|loc=10.11 Bibliographic Notes for Chapter 10, p. 589}} programs at [[Bell Labs]] in the 1970s, including [[vi]], [[Lex programming tool|lex]], [[sed]], [[AWK]], and [[expr]], and in other programs such as [[Emacs]]. Regexes were subsequently adopted by a wide range of programs, with these early forms standardized in the [[POSIX.2]] standard in 1992.\n\nIn the 1980s the more complicated regexes arose in [[Perl]], which originally derived from a regex library written by [[Henry Spencer]] (1986), who later wrote an implementation of ''Advanced Regular Expressions'' for [[Tcl]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tcl.tk/doc/howto/regexp81.html | title = New Regular Expression Features in Tcl 8.1 | accessdate = 2013-10-11}}</ref> The Tcl library is a hybrid [[Nondeterministic finite automaton|NFA]]/[[Deterministic finite automaton|DFA]] implementation with improved performance characteristics.

These rules maintain existing features of Perl 5.x regexes, but also allow [[Backus\u2013Naur form|BNF]]-style definition of a [[recursive descent parser]] via sub-rules.\n\nThe use of regexes in structured information standards for document and database modeling started in the 1960s and expanded in the 1980s when industry standards like [[Standard Generalized Markup Language|ISO SGML]] (precursored by ANSI \"GCA 101-1983\") consolidated. The kernel of the [[XML schema#Validation|structure specification language]] standards consists of regexes. Its use is evident in the [[Document Type Definition|DTD]] element group syntax.\n\nStarting in 1997, [[Philip Hazel]] developed [[Perl Compatible Regular Expressions|PCRE]] (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions), which attempts to closely mimic Perl's regex functionality and is used by many modern tools including [[PHP]] and [[Apache HTTP Server]].\n\nToday, regexes are widely supported in programming languages, text processing programs (particularly [[Lexical analysis|lexers]]), advanced text editors, and some other programs. Regex support is part of the [[standard library]] of many programming languages, including [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]], and is built into the syntax of others, including Perl and [[ECMAScript]]. Implementations of regex functionality is often called a '''regex engine''', and a number of libraries are available for reuse. In the late 2010s, several companies started to offer hardware, [[FPGA]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://grovf.com/products/gregex|title=GROVF {{!}} Big Data Analytics Acceleration|website=grovf.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref>, [[GPU]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bkase.github.io/CUDA-grep/finalreport.html|title=CUDA grep|website=bkase.github.io|access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref> implementations of [[PCRE]] compatible '''regex engines''' that are faster compared to [[Central processing unit|CPU]] implementations'''.'''\n\n==Basic concepts==\nA regular expression, often called a ''pattern'', specifies a [[Set (computer science)|set]] of strings required for a particular purpose. A simple way to specify a finite set of strings is to list its [[Data element|elements]] or members. However, there are often more concise ways: for example, the set containing the three strings \"Handel\", \"H\u00e4ndel\", and \"Haendel\" can be specified by the pattern <code>H(\u00e4|ae?)ndel</code>; we say that this pattern ''matches'' each of the three strings. In most [[formalism (mathematics)|formalism]]s, if there exists at least one regular expression that matches a particular set then there exists an infinite number of other regular expressions that also match it\u2014the specification is not unique. Most formalisms provide the following operations to construct regular expressions.\n\n;Boolean \"or\"\n:A [[vertical bar]] separates alternatives. For example, {{code|lang=perl|code=gray{{!}}grey}} can match \"gray\" or \"grey\".\n;Grouping\n:[[Parentheses]] are used to define the scope and precedence of the [[Operator (programming)|operators]] (among other uses). For example, <code>gray|grey</code> and {{code|lang=perl|code=gr(a{{!}}e)y}} are equivalent patterns which both describe the set of \"gray\" or \"grey\".\n;Quantification\n:A [[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantifier]] after a [[Lexical analysis#Token|token]] (such as a character) or group specifies how often that a preceding element is allowed to occur. The most common quantifiers are the [[question mark]] <code>?</code>, the [[asterisk]] <code>*</code> (derived from the [[Kleene star]]), and the [[plus sign]] <code>+</code> ([[Kleene plus]]).\n:{|\n| style=\"width:15px; vertical-align:top;\" | <code>'''?'''</code>\n|The question mark indicates ''zero or one'' occurrences of the preceding element. For example, <code><!--DON'T CHANGE THIS TO \"colo?r\"! REGULAR EXPRESSIONS DON'T WORK LIKE WILDCARDS!--><!--Why not? Give reason in main context.!-->colou?r</code> matches both \"color\" and \"colour\".\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" | <code>'''<nowiki>*</nowiki>'''</code>\n|The asterisk indicates ''zero or more'' occurrences of the preceding element. For example, <code>ab*c</code> matches \"ac\", \"abc\", \"abbc\", \"abbbc\", and so on.\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" | <code>'''+'''</code>\n|The plus sign indicates ''one or more'' occurrences of the preceding element. For example, <code>ab+c</code> matches \"abc\", \"abbc\", \"abbbc\", and so on, but not \"ac\".\n|-\n|<code>'''{n}'''</code><ref name=\"grep\">grep(1) man page</ref>\n| The preceding item is matched exactly ''n'' times.\n|-\n|<code>'''{min,}'''</code><ref name=\"grep\"/>\n| The preceding item is matched ''min'' or more times.\n|-\n|<code>'''{min,max}'''</code><ref name=\"grep\"/>\n| The preceding item is matched at least ''min'' times, but not more than ''max'' times.\n|}\n;Wildcard\nThe wildcard <code>'''.'''</code> matches any character. For example, <code>a.b</code> matches any string that contains an \"a\", then any other character and then a \"b\", <code>a.*b</code> matches any string that contains an \"a\" and a \"b\" at some later point.\n\nThese constructions can be combined to form arbitrarily complex expressions, much like one can construct arithmetical expressions from numbers and the operations +, \u2212, \u00d7, and \u00f7. For example, <code>H(ae?|\u00e4)ndel</code> and {{code|lang=perl|code=H(a{{!}}ae{{!}}\u00e4)ndel}} are both valid patterns which match the same strings as the earlier example, <code>H(\u00e4|ae?)ndel</code>.\n\nThe precise [[syntax]] for regular expressions varies among tools and with context; more detail is given in {{slink||Syntax}}.\n\n==Formal language theory==\nRegular expressions describe [[regular language]]s in [[Formal language|formal language theory]]. They have the same expressive power as [[regular grammar]]s.\n\n===Formal definition===\nRegular expressions consist of constants, which denote sets of strings, and operator symbols, which denote operations over these sets. The following definition is standard, and found as such in most textbooks on formal language theory.<ref name=\"HopcroftMotwaniUllman01\">{{harvtxt|Hopcroft|Motwani|Ullman|2000}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Sipser|1998}}</ref> Given a finite [[alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]] \u03a3, the following constants are defined\nas regular expressions:\n*(''empty set'') \u2205 denoting the set \u2205.\n*(''[[empty string]]'') \u03b5 denoting the set containing only the \"empty\" string, which has no characters at all.\n*(''[[string literal|literal character]]'') <code>a</code> in \u03a3 denoting the set containing only the character ''a''.\n\nGiven regular expressions R and S, the following operations over them are defined\nto produce regular expressions:\n* (''[[concatenation]]'') ''RS'' denotes the set of strings that can be obtained by concatenating a string in R and a string in S. For example, let R = {\"ab\", \"c\"}, and S = {\"d\", \"ef\"}. Then, RS = {\"abd\", \"abef\", \"cd\", \"cef\"}.\n*(''[[alternation (formal language theory)|alternation]]'') ''R'' | ''S'' denotes the [[set union]] of sets described by ''R'' and ''S''. For example, if R describes {\"ab\", \"c\"} and S describes {\"ab\", \"d\", \"ef\"}, expression ''R'' | ''S'' describes {\"ab\", \"c\", \"d\", \"ef\"}.\n*(''[[Kleene star]]'') ''R''* denotes the smallest [[subset|superset]] of the set described by ''R'' that contains \u03b5 and is [[Closure (mathematics)|closed]] under string concatenation. This is the set of all strings that can be made by concatenating any finite number (including zero) of strings from the set described by ''R''. For example, {\"0\",\"1\"}* is the set of all finite [[binary string]]s (including the empty string), and {\"ab\", \"c\"}* = {\u03b5, \"ab\", \"c\", \"abab\", \"abc\", \"cab\", \"cc\", \"ababab\", \"abcab\", ... }.\n\nTo avoid parentheses it is assumed that the Kleene star has the highest priority, then concatenation and then alternation. If there is no ambiguity then parentheses may be omitted. For example, <code>(ab)c</code> can be written as <code>abc</code>, and <code>a|(b(c*))</code> can be written as <code>a|bc*</code>.\nMany textbooks use the symbols \u222a, +, or \u2228 for alternation instead of the vertical bar.\n\n'''Examples:'''\n*<code>a|b*</code> denotes {\u03b5, \"a\", \"b\", \"bb\", \"bbb\", ...}\n*<code>(a|b)*</code> denotes the set of all strings with no symbols other than \"a\" and \"b\", including the empty string: {\u03b5, \"a\", \"b\", \"aa\", \"ab\", \"ba\", \"bb\", \"aaa\", ...}\n*<code>ab*(c|\u03b5)</code> denotes the set of strings starting with \"a\", then zero or more \"b\"s and finally optionally a \"c\": {\"a\", \"ac\", \"ab\", \"abc\", \"abb\", \"abbc\", ...}\n*<code>(0|(1(01*0)*1))*</code> denotes the set of binary numbers that are multiples of 3: { \u03b5, \"0\", \"00\", \"11\", \"000\", \"011\", \"110\", \"0000\", \"0011\", \"0110\", \"1001\", \"1100\", \"1111\", \"00000\", ... }\n\n===Expressive power and compactness===\nThe formal definition of regular expressions is minimal on purpose, and avoids defining <code>?</code> and <code>+</code>\u2014these can be expressed as follows: <code>a+</code> = <code>aa*</code>, and <code>a?</code> = <code>(a|\u03b5)</code>. Sometimes the [[set complement|complement]] operator is added, to give a ''generalized regular expression''; here ''R<sup>c</sup>'' matches all strings over \u03a3* that do not match ''R''. In principle, the complement operator is redundant, because it doesn't grant any more expressive power. However, it can make a regular expression much more concise\u2014eliminating all complement operators from a regular expression can cause a [[Double exponential function|double exponentially]] blow-up of its length.<ref>{{harvtxt|Gelade|Neven|2008}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Gruber|Holzer|2008}}</ref>\n\nRegular expressions in this sense can express the regular languages, exactly the class of languages accepted by [[deterministic finite automata]]. There is, however, a significant difference in compactness. Some classes of regular languages can only be described by deterministic finite automata whose size grows [[exponential growth|exponentially]] in the size of the shortest equivalent regular expressions. The standard example here is the languages\n''L<sub>k</sub>'' consisting of all strings over the alphabet {''a'',''b''} whose ''k''<sup>th</sup>-from-last letter equals&nbsp;''a''. On one hand, a regular expression describing ''L''<sub>4</sub> is given by\n<math>(a\\mid b)^*a(a\\mid b)(a\\mid b)(a\\mid b)</math>.\n\nGeneralizing this pattern to ''L<sub>k</sub>'' gives the expression:\n<math>(a\\mid b)^*a\\underbrace{(a\\mid b)(a\\mid b)\\cdots(a\\mid b)}_{k-1\\text{ times}}. \\, </math>\n\nOn the other hand, it is known that every deterministic finite automaton accepting the language ''L<sub>k</sub>'' must have at least 2<sup>''k''</sup> states. Luckily, there is a simple mapping from regular expressions to the more general [[nondeterministic finite automata]] (NFAs) that does not lead to such a blowup in size; for this reason NFAs are often used as alternative representations of regular languages. NFAs are a simple variation of the type-3 [[formal grammar|grammars]] of the [[Chomsky hierarchy]].<ref name=\"HopcroftMotwaniUllman01\"/>\n\nIn the opposite direction, there are many languages easily described by a DFA that are not easily described a regular expression. For instance, determining the validity of a given [[ISBN]] requires computing the modulus of the integer base 11, and can be easily implemented with an 11-state DFA. However, a regular expression to answer the same problem of divisibility by 11 is at least multiple megabytes in length.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nGiven a regular expression, [[Thompson's construction algorithm]] computes an equivalent nondeterministic finite automaton. A conversion in the opposite direction is achieved by [[Kleene's algorithm]].\n\nFinally, it is worth noting that many real-world \"regular expression\" engines implement features that cannot be described by the regular expressions in the sense of formal language theory; rather, they implement ''regexes''. See [[#Patterns for non-regular languages|below]] for more on this.\n\n===Deciding equivalence of regular expressions===\nAs seen in many of the examples above, there is more than one way to construct a regular expression to achieve the same results.\n\nIt is possible to write an [[algorithm]] that, for two given regular expressions, decides whether the described languages are equal; the algorithm reduces each expression to a [[minimal deterministic finite state machine]], and determines whether they are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] (equivalent).\n\nAlgebraic laws for regular expressions can be obtained using a method by Gischer which is best explained along an example: In order to check whether (''X''+''Y'')<sup>*</sup> and (''X''<sup>*</sup> ''Y''<sup>*</sup>)<sup>*</sup> denote the same regular language, for all regular expressions ''X'', ''Y'', it is necessary and sufficient to check whether the particular regular expressions (''a''+''b'')<sup>*</sup> and (''a''<sup>*</sup> ''b''<sup>*</sup>)<sup>*</sup> denote the same language over the alphabet \u03a3={''a'',''b''}. More generally, an equation ''E''=''F'' between regular-expression terms with variables holds if, and only if, its instantiation with different variables replaced by different symbol constants holds.<ref>{{cite report | url= | author=Jay L.

As simple as the regular expressions are, there is no method to systematically rewrite them to some normal form. The lack of axiom in the past led to the [[star height problem]]. In 1991, [[Dexter Kozen]] axiomatized regular expressions as a [[Kleene algebra#History|Kleene algebra]], using equational and [[Horn clause]] axioms.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kozen|1991}}{{page needed|date=February 2015}}</ref>\nAlready in 1964, Redko had proved that no finite set of purely equational axioms can characterize the algebra of regular languages.<ref>{{cite journal| author=V.N.

The pattern is composed of a sequence of ''atoms''. An atom is a single point within the regex pattern which it tries to match to the target string. The simplest atom is a literal, but grouping parts of the pattern to match an atom will require using <code>(&nbsp;)</code> as metacharacters. Metacharacters help form: ''atoms''; ''quantifiers'' telling how many atoms (and whether it is a [[#Lazy_matching|''greedy'' quantifier]] or not); a logical OR character, which offers a set of alternatives, and a logical NOT character, which negates an atom's existence; and backreferences to refer to previous atoms of a completing pattern of atoms. A match is made, not when all the atoms of the string are matched, but rather when all the pattern atoms in the regex have matched. The idea is to make a small pattern of characters stand for a large number of possible strings, rather than compiling a large list of all the literal possibilities.\n\nDepending on the regex processor there are about fourteen metacharacters, characters that may or may not have their [[literal (computer programming)|literal]] character meaning, depending on context, or whether they are \"escaped\", i.e. preceded by an [[escape sequence]], in this case, the backslash <code>\\</code>. Modern and POSIX extended regexes use metacharacters more often than their literal meaning, so to avoid \"backslash-osis\" or [[leaning toothpick syndrome]] it makes sense to have a metacharacter escape to a literal mode; but starting out, it makes more sense to have the four bracketing metacharacters <code>(&nbsp;)</code> and <code>{&nbsp;}</code> be primarily literal, and \"escape\" this usual meaning to become metacharacters. Common standards implement both. The usual metacharacters are <code> {}[]()^$.|*+?</code> and <code>\\</code>. The usual characters that become metacharacters when escaped are <code>dswDSW</code> and <code>N</code>.\n\n===Delimiters===\nWhen entering a regex in a programming language, they may be represented as a usual string literal, hence usually quoted; this is common in C, Java, and Python for instance, where the regex <code>re</code> is entered as <code>\"re\"</code>. However, they are often written with slashes as [[delimiter]]s, as in <code>/re/</code> for the regex <code>re</code>. This originates in [[Ed (text editor)|ed]], where <code>/</code> is the editor command for searching, and an expression <code>/re/</code> can be used to specify a range of lines (matching the pattern), which can be combined with other commands on either side, most famously <code>g/re/p</code> as in [[grep]] (\"global regex print\"), which is included in most [[Unix]]-based operating systems, such as [[Linux]] distributions. A similar convention is used in [[sed]], where search and replace is given by <code>s/re/replacement/</code> and patterns can be joined with a comma to specify a range of lines as in <code>/re1/,/re2/</code>. This notation is particularly well known due to its use in [[Perl]], where it forms part of the syntax distinct from normal string literals. In some cases, such as sed and Perl, alternative delimiters can be used to avoid collision with contents, and to avoid having to escape occurrences of the delimiter character in the contents. For example, in sed the command <code>s,/,X,</code> will replace a <code>/</code> with an <code>X</code>, using commas as delimiters.\n\n===Standards===\n{{anchor|POSIX}}The [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] [[POSIX]] standard has three sets of compliance: '''BRE''' (Basic Regular Expressions),<ref>ISO/IEC 9945-2:1993 ''Information technology \u2013 Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) \u2013 Part 2: Shell and Utilities'', successively revised as ISO/IEC 9945-2:2002 ''Information technology \u2013 Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) \u2013 Part 2: System Interfaces'', ISO/IEC 9945-2:2003, and currently ISO/IEC/IEEE 9945:2009 ''Information technology \u2013 Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX\u00ae) Base Specifications, Issue 7''</ref> '''ERE''' (Extended Regular Expressions), and '''SRE''' (Simple Regular Expressions). SRE is [[Deprecation|deprecated]],<ref>The Single Unix Specification (Version 2)</ref> in favor of BRE, as both provide [[backward compatibility]]. The subsection below covering the ''character classes'' applies to both BRE and ERE.\n\nBRE and ERE work together. ERE adds <code>?</code>, <code>+</code>, and <code>|</code>, and it removes the need to escape the metacharacters <code>(&nbsp;)</code> and <code>{&nbsp;}</code>, which are ''required'' in BRE. Furthermore, as long as the POSIX standard syntax for regexes is adhered to, there can be, and often is, additional syntax to serve specific (yet POSIX compliant) applications. Although POSIX.2 leaves some implementation specifics undefined, BRE and ERE provide a \"standard\" which has since been adopted as the default syntax of many tools, where the choice of BRE or ERE modes is usually a supported option. For example, [[GNU]] <code>grep</code> has the following options: \"<code>grep -E</code>\" for ERE, and \"<code>grep -G</code>\" for BRE (the default), and \"<code>grep -P</code>\" for [[Perl]] regexes.\n\nPerl regexes have become a de facto standard, having a rich and powerful set of atomic expressions. Perl has no \"basic\" or \"extended\" levels. As in POSIX EREs, <code>(&nbsp;)</code> and <code>{&nbsp;}</code> are treated as metacharacters unless escaped; other metacharacters are known to be literal or symbolic based on context alone. Additional functionality includes [[#Lazy matching|lazy matching]], [[backreferences]], named capture groups, and [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive]] patterns.\n\n====POSIX basic and extended====\nIn the [[POSIX]] standard, Basic Regular Syntax ('''BRE''') requires that the [[metacharacter]]s <code>(&nbsp;)</code> and <code>{&nbsp;}</code> be designated <code>\\(\\)</code> and <code>\\{\\}</code>, whereas Extended Regular Syntax ('''ERE''') does not.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Metacharacter\n! Description\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!<code>^</code>\n|Matches the starting position within the string. In line-based tools, it matches the starting position of any line.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!<code>.</code>\n|Matches any single character (many applications exclude [[newline]]s, and exactly which characters are considered newlines is flavor-, character-encoding-, and platform-specific, but it is safe to assume that the line feed character is included). Within POSIX bracket expressions, the dot character matches a literal dot. For example, <code>a.c</code> matches \"abc\", etc., but <code>[a.c]</code> matches only \"a\", \".\", or \"c\".\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!<code>[&nbsp;]</code>\n|A bracket expression. Matches a single character that is contained within the brackets. For example, <code>[abc]</code> matches \"a\", \"b\", or \"c\". <code>[a-z]</code> specifies a range which matches any lowercase letter from \"a\" to \"z\". These forms can be mixed: <code>[abcx-z]</code> matches \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"x\", \"y\", or \"z\", as does <code>[a-cx-z]</code>.\nThe <code>-</code> character is treated as a literal character if it is the last or the first (after the <code>^</code>, if present) character within the brackets: <code>[abc-]</code>, <code>[-abc]</code>. Note that backslash escapes are not allowed. The <code>]</code> character can be included in a bracket expression if it is the first (after the <code>^</code>) character: <code>[]abc]</code>.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!<code>[^&nbsp;]</code>\n|Matches a single character that is not contained within the brackets. For example, <code>[^abc]</code> matches any character other than \"a\", \"b\", or \"c\". <code>[^a-z]</code> matches any single character that is not a lowercase letter from \"a\" to \"z\". Likewise, literal characters and ranges can be mixed.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!<code>$</code>\n|Matches the ending position of the string or the position just before a string-ending newline. In line-based tools, it matches the ending position of any line.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!<code>( )</code>\n|Defines a marked subexpression. The string matched within the parentheses can be recalled later (see the next entry, <code>\\''n''</code>). A marked subexpression is also called a block or capturing group. '''BRE mode requires {{nowrap|<code>\\(&nbsp;\\)</code>}}'''.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!<code>\\''n''</code>\n|Matches what the ''n''th marked subexpression matched, where ''n'' is a digit from 1 to 9. This construct is vaguely defined in the POSIX.2 standard. Some tools allow referencing more than nine capturing groups. Also known as a backreference.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!<code>*</code>\n|Matches the preceding element zero or more times. For example, <code>ab*c</code> matches \"ac\", \"abc\", \"abbbc\", etc. <code>[xyz]*</code> matches \"\", \"x\", \"y\", \"z\", \"zx\", \"zyx\", \"xyzzy\", and so on. <code>(ab)*</code> matches \"\", \"ab\", \"abab\", \"ababab\", and so on.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!{{nowrap|<code>{''m'',''n''}</code>}}\n|Matches the preceding element at least ''m'' and not more than ''n'' times. For example, <code>a{3,5}</code> matches only \"aaa\", \"aaaa\", and \"aaaaa\". This is not found in a few older instances of regexes. '''BRE mode requires <code>{{nowrap|\\{''m'',''n''\\}}}</code>'''.\n\n|}\n\n'''Examples:'''\n*<code>.at</code> matches any three-character string ending with \"at\", including \"hat\", \"cat\", and \"bat\".\n*<code>[hc]at</code> matches \"hat\" and \"cat\".\n*<code>[^b]at</code> matches all strings matched by <code>.at</code> except \"bat\".\n*<code>[^hc]at</code> matches all strings matched by <code>.at</code> other than \"hat\" and \"cat\".\n*<code>^[hc]at</code> matches \"hat\" and \"cat\", but only at the beginning of the string or line.\n*<code>[hc]at$</code> matches \"hat\" and \"cat\", but only at the end of the string or line.\n*<code>\\[.\\]</code> matches any single character surrounded by \"[\" and \"]\" since the brackets are escaped, for example: \"[a]\" and \"[b]\".\n*<code>s.*</code> matches s followed by zero or more characters, for example: \"s\" and \"saw\" and \"seed\".\n\n====POSIX extended====\nThe meaning of metacharacters [[escape character|escaped]] with a backslash is reversed for some characters in the POSIX Extended Regular Expression ('''ERE''') syntax. With this syntax, a backslash causes the metacharacter to be treated as a literal character. So, for example, <code>\\(&nbsp;\\)</code> is now <code>(&nbsp;)</code> and <code>\\{&nbsp;\\}</code> is now <code>{&nbsp;}</code>. Additionally, support is removed for <code>\\''n''</code> backreferences and the following metacharacters are added:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Metacharacter\n! Description\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!<code>?</code>\n|Matches the preceding element zero or one time. For example, <code>ab?c</code> matches only \"ac\" or \"abc\".\n|-\n!<code>+</code>\n|Matches the preceding element one or more times. For example, <code>ab+c</code> matches \"abc\", \"abbc\", \"abbbc\", and so on, but not \"ac\".\n|-\n!<code><nowiki>|</nowiki></code>\n|The choice (also known as alternation or set union) operator matches either the expression before or the expression after the operator. For example, <code><nowiki>abc|def</nowiki></code> matches \"abc\" or \"def\".</td>\n|}\n\n'''Examples:'''\n*<code>[hc]?at</code> matches \"at\", \"hat\", and \"cat\".\n*<code>[hc]*at</code> matches \"at\", \"hat\", \"cat\", \"hhat\", \"chat\", \"hcat\", \"cchchat\", and so on.\n*<code>[hc]+at</code> matches \"hat\", \"cat\", \"hhat\", \"chat\", \"hcat\", \"cchchat\", and so on, but not \"at\".\n*<code>cat|dog</code> matches \"cat\" or \"dog\".\n\nPOSIX Extended Regular Expressions can often be used with modern Unix utilities by including the [[command line]] flag <var>-E</var>.\n\n====Character classes====\nThe character class is the most basic regex concept after a literal match. It makes one small sequence of characters match a larger set of characters. For example, <source lang=\"ragel\" inline>[A-Z]</source> could stand for the uppercase alphabet in the English language, and <source lang=\"ragel\" inline>\\d</source> could mean any digit. Character classes apply to both POSIX levels.\n\nWhen specifying a range of characters, such as <source lang=\"ragel\" inline>[a-Z]</source> (i.e. lowercase ''<source lang=\"ragel\" inline>a</source>'' to uppercase ''<source lang=\"ragel\" inline>Z</source>''), the computer's locale settings determine the contents by the numeric ordering of the character encoding. They could store digits in that sequence, or the ordering could be ''abc\u2026zABC\u2026Z'', or ''aAbBcC\u2026zZ''. So the POSIX standard defines a character class, which will be known by the regex processor installed. Those definitions are in the following table:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! POSIX !!

For example, <source lang=\"ragel\" inline>[[:upper:]ab]</source> matches the uppercase letters and lowercase \"a\" and \"b\".\n\nAn additional non-POSIX class understood by some tools is <source lang=\"ragel\" inline>[:word:]</source>, which is usually defined as <source lang=\"ragel\" inline>[:alnum:]</source> plus underscore. This reflects the fact that in many programming languages these are the characters that may be used in identifiers. The editor [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]] further distinguishes ''word'' and ''word-head'' classes (using the notation <source lang=\"ragel\" inline>\\w</source> and <source lang=\"ragel\" inline>\\h</source>) since in many programming languages the characters that can begin an identifier are not the same as those that can occur in other positions: numbers are generally excluded, so an identifier would look like <source lang=\"ragel\" inline>\\h\\w*</source> or <source lang=\"ragel\" inline>[[:alpha:]_][[:alnum:]_]*</source> in POSIX notation.\n\nNote that what the POSIX regex standards call ''character classes'' are commonly referred to as ''POSIX character classes'' in other regex flavors which support them. With most other regex flavors, the term ''character class'' is used to describe what POSIX calls ''bracket expressions''.\n\n===Perl and PCRE===\n{{See also|Perl Compatible Regular Expressions}}\nBecause of its expressive power and (relative) ease of reading, many other utilities and programming languages have adopted syntax similar to [[Perl]]'s &mdash; for example, [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[JavaScript]], [[Julia (programming language)|Julia]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[Qt (software)|Qt]], Microsoft's [[.NET Framework]], and [[XML Schema (W3C)|XML Schema]]. Some languages and tools such as [[Boost C++ Libraries|Boost]] and [[PHP]] support multiple regex flavors. Perl-derivative regex implementations are not identical and usually implement a subset of features found in Perl 5.0, released in 1994. Perl sometimes does incorporate features initially found in other languages. For example, Perl 5.10 implements syntactic extensions originally developed in PCRE and Python.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html#PCRE%2fPython-Support | title= Perl Regular Expression Documentation |publisher=perldoc.perl.org | accessdate=January 8, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Lazy matching===\nIn Python and some<!---should be 'many', or 'most', or 'a few', or ...?---> other implementations (e.g. Java), the three common quantifiers (<code>*</code>, <code>+</code> and <code>?</code>) are [[greedy algorithm|greedy]] by default because they match as many characters as possible.<ref name=py-re>{{cite web|title=Regular Expression Syntax|url=https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax|website=Python 3.5.0 documentation|publisher=[[Python Software Foundation]]|accessdate=10 October 2015}}</ref> The regex <code>\".+\"</code> (including the double-quotes) applied to the string\n\n \"Ganymede,\" he continued, \"is the largest moon in the Solar System.\"\n\nmatches the entire line (because the entire line begins and ends with a double-quote) instead of matching only the first part, <code>\"Ganymede,\"</code>. The aforementioned quantifiers may, however, be made ''lazy'' or ''minimal'' or ''reluctant'', matching as few characters as possible, by appending a question mark: <code>\".+?\"</code> matches only <code>\"Ganymede,\"</code>.<ref name=py-re/>\n\nHowever, the whole sentence can still be matched in some circumstances. The question-mark operator does not change the meaning of the dot operator, so this still can match the double-quotes in the input. A pattern like <code>\".*?\" EOF</code> will still match the whole input if this is the string:\n\n \"Ganymede,\" he continued, \"is the largest moon in the Solar System.\" EOF\n\nTo ensure that the double-quotes cannot be part of the match, the dot has to be replaced, e. g. like this: <code>\"[^\"]*\"</code> This will match a quoted text part without additional double-quotes in it. (By removing possibilities for a fixed suffix to be matched, one also transforms the lazy-match to a greedy-match.)\n\n===Possessive matching===\nIn Java, quantifiers may be made ''possessive'' by appending a plus sign, which disables backing off (in a backtracking engine), even if doing so would allow the overall match to succeed:<ref name=es-re>{{cite web|title=Essential classes: Regular Expressions: Quantifiers: Differences Among Greedy, Reluctant, and Possessive Quantifiers|url=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/regex/quant.html#difs|website=The Java Tutorials|publisher=[[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]|accessdate=23 December 2016}}</ref> While the regex <code>\".*\"</code> applied to the string\n\n \"Ganymede,\" he continued, \"is the largest moon in the Solar System.\"\n\nmatches the entire line, the regex <code>\".*+\"</code> does {{em|not match at all}}, because <code>.*+</code> consumes the entire input, including the final <code>\"</code>. Thus, possessive quantifiers are most useful with negated character classes, e.g. <code>\"[^\"]*+\"</code>, which matches <code>\"Ganymede,\"</code> when applied to the same string.\n\nAnother common extension serving the same function is atomic grouping, which disables backtracking for a parenthesized group. The typical syntax is {{mono|1=(?&gt;group)}}. For example, while {{mono|1=^(wi{{!}}w)i$}} matches both {{mono|wi}} and {{mono|wii}}, {{mono|1=^(?&gt;wi{{!}}w)i$}} only matches {{mono|wii}} because the engine is forbidden from backtracking and try with setting the group as \"w\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Atomic Grouping |url=https://www.regular-expressions.info/atomic.html |website=Regex Tutorial |accessdate=24 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nPossessive quantifiers are easier to implement than greedy and lazy quantifiers, and are typically more efficient at runtime.<ref name=es-re/>\n\n==Patterns for non-regular languages==\nMany features found in virtually all modern regular expression libraries provide an expressive power that far exceeds the [[regular language]]s. For example, many implementations allow grouping subexpressions with parentheses and recalling the value they match in the same expression (''{{visible anchor|backreferences}}''). This means that, among other things, a pattern can match strings of repeated words like \"papa\" or \"WikiWiki\", called ''squares'' in formal language theory. The pattern for these strings is <code>(.+)\\1</code>.\n\nThe language of squares is not regular, nor is it [[context-free language|context-free]], due to the [[Pumping lemma for context-free languages|pumping lemma]]. However, [[pattern matching]] with an unbounded number of backreferences, as supported by numerous modern tools, is still [[context-sensitive language|context sensitive]].<ref>{{cite journal | author=Cezar C\u00e2mpeanu and Kai Salomaa, and Sheng Yu | title=A Formal Study of Practical Regular Expressions | journal=International Journal of Foundations of Computer Science | volume=14 | number=6 | pages=1007\u20131018 | url=http://137.149.157.5/Articles/index.php?aid=1<!---This url was taken from C\u00e2mpeanu's publications page http://www.csit.upei.ca/~ccampeanu/Research/RJ--->| date=Dec 2003 | doi=10.1142/S012905410300214X }} Theorem 3 (p.9)</ref> The general problem of matching any number of backreferences is [[NP-complete]], growing exponentially by the number of backref groups used.<ref>{{cite web |title=Perl Regular Expression Matching is NP-Hard |url=https://perl.plover.com/NPC/ |website=perl.plover.com}}</ref>\n\nHowever, many tools, libraries, and engines that provide such constructions still use the term ''regular expression'' for their patterns. This has led to a nomenclature where the term regular expression has different meanings in [[formal language|formal language theory]] and pattern matching. For this reason, some people have taken to using the term ''regex'', ''regexp'', or simply ''pattern'' to describe the latter. [[Larry Wall]], author of the Perl programming language, writes in an essay about the design of Raku:\n\n{{bq|1=\"Regular expressions\" [\u2026] are only marginally related to real regular expressions. Nevertheless, the term has grown with the capabilities of our pattern matching engines, so I'm not going to try to fight linguistic necessity here. I will, however, generally call them \"regexes\" (or \"regexen\", when I'm in an Anglo-Saxon mood).<ref name=\"Apocalypse5\"/>}}\n\nOther features not found in describing regular languages include assertions. These include the ubiquitous {{mono|^}} and {{mono|$}}, as well as some more sophiscated extensions like lookaround. They define the surrounding of a match and don't spill into the match itself, a feature only relevant for the use-case of string searching. Some of them can be simulated in a regular language by treating the surroundings as a part of the language as well.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wandering Logic |title=How to simulate lookaheads and lookbehinds in finite state automata? |url=https://cs.stackexchange.com/a/40058 |website=Computer Science Stack Exchange |accessdate=24 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|Implementations}}Implementations and running times==\nThere are at least three different [[algorithm]]s that decide whether and how a given regex matches a string.\n\nThe oldest and fastest relies on a result in formal language theory that allows every [[nondeterministic finite automaton]] (NFA) to be transformed into a [[deterministic finite automaton]] (DFA). The DFA can be constructed explicitly and then run on the resulting input string one symbol at a time. Constructing the DFA for a regular expression of size ''m'' has the time and memory cost of [[Big O notation|''O'']](2<sup>''m''</sup>), but it can be run on a string of size ''n'' in time ''O''(''n'').  Note that the size of the expression is the size after abbreviations, such as numeric quantifiers, have been expanded.\n\nAn alternative approach is to simulate the NFA directly, essentially building each DFA state on demand and then discarding it at the next step. This keeps the DFA implicit and avoids the exponential construction cost, but running cost rises to ''O''(''mn''). The explicit approach is called the DFA algorithm and the implicit approach the NFA algorithm. Adding caching to the NFA algorithm is often called the \"lazy DFA\" algorithm, or just the DFA algorithm without making a distinction. These algorithms are fast, but using them for recalling grouped subexpressions, lazy quantification, and similar features is tricky.<ref>{{harvtxt|Cox|2007}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Laurikari|2009}}</ref> Modern implementations include the re1-re2-sregex family based on Cox's code.\n\nThe third algorithm is to match the pattern against the input string by [[backtracking]]. This algorithm is commonly called NFA, but this terminology can be confusing. Its running time can be exponential, which simple implementations exhibit when matching against expressions like {{code|lang=perl|code=(a{{!}}aa)*b}} that contain both alternation and unbounded quantification and force the algorithm to consider an exponentially increasing number of sub-cases. This behavior can cause a security problem called [[Regular expression Denial of Service]] (ReDoS).\n\nAlthough backtracking implementations only give an exponential guarantee in the worst case, they provide much greater flexibility and expressive power. For example, any implementation which allows the use of backreferences, or implements the various extensions introduced by Perl, must include some kind of backtracking. Some implementations try to provide the best of both algorithms by first running a fast DFA algorithm, and revert to a potentially slower backtracking algorithm only when a backreference is encountered during the match. GNU grep (and the underlying gnulib DFA) uses such a strategy.<ref>{{cite web |title=gnulib/lib/dfa.c |url=https://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=gnulib.git;a=blob;f=lib/dfa.c |quote=If the scanner detects a transition on backref, it returns a kind of \"semi-success\" indicating that the match will have to be verified with a backtracking matcher.}}</ref>\n\nSublinear runtime algorithms have been achieved using [[Boyer\u2013Moore string-search algorithm|Boyer-Moore (BM) based algorithms]] and related DFA optimization techniques such as the reverse scan.<ref>{{cite arXiv |last=Kearns |first=Steven |eprint=1308.3822 |title=Sublinear Matching With Finite Automata Using Reverse Suffix Scanning |date=August 2013}}</ref> GNU grep, which supports a wide variety of POSIX syntaxes and extensions, uses BM for a first-pass prefiltering, and then uses an implicit DFA.

One naive method that duplicates a non-backtracking NFA for each backreference note has a complexity of {{tmath|{\\mathrm O}(n^{2k+2})}} time and {{tmath|{\\mathrm O}(n^{2k+1})}} space for a haystack of length n and k backreferences in the RegExp.<ref>{{cite web |title=travisdowns/polyregex |url=https://github.com/travisdowns/polyregex |date=5 July 2019}}</ref> A very recent theoretical work based on memory automata gives a tighter bound based on \"active\" variable nodes used, and a polynomial possibility for some backreferenced regexps.<ref>{{cite arXiv |last=Schmid |first=Markus L. |eprint=1903.05896 |title=Regular Expressions with Backreferences: Polynomial-Time Matching Techniques |date=March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Unicode==\nIn theoretical terms, any token set can be matched by regular expressions as long as it is pre-defined. In terms of historical implementations, regexes were originally written to use [[American Standard Code for Information Interchange|ASCII]] characters as their token set though regex libraries have supported numerous other [[character set]]s. Many modern regex engines offer at least some support for [[Unicode]]. In most respects it makes no difference what the character set is, but some issues do arise when extending regexes to support Unicode.\n\n* '''Supported encoding'''. Some regex libraries expect to work on some particular encoding instead of on abstract Unicode characters. Many of these require the [[UTF-8]] encoding, while others might expect [[UTF-16]], or [[UTF-32]]. In contrast, Perl and Java are agnostic on encodings, instead operating on decoded characters internally.\n* '''Supported Unicode range'''. Many regex engines support only the [[Basic Multilingual Plane]], that is, the characters which can be encoded with only 16 bits. Currently (as of 2016) only a few regex engines (e.g., Perl's and Java's) can handle the full 21-bit Unicode range.\n* '''Extending ASCII-oriented constructs to Unicode'''. For example, in ASCII-based implementations, character ranges of the form <code>[x-y]</code> are valid wherever ''x'' and ''y'' have [[code point]]s in the range [0x00,0x7F] and codepoint(''x'') \u2264 codepoint(''y''). The natural extension of such character ranges to Unicode would simply change the requirement that the endpoints lie in [0x00,0x7F] to the requirement that they lie in [0x0000,0x10FFFF]. However, in practice this is often not the case. Some implementations, such as that of [[Gawk (GNU package)|gawk]], do not allow character ranges to cross Unicode blocks. A range like [0x61,0x7F] is valid since both endpoints fall within the Basic Latin block, as is [0x0530,0x0560] since both endpoints fall within the Armenian block, but a range like [0x0061,0x0532] is invalid since it includes multiple Unicode blocks. Other engines, such as that of the [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]] editor, allow block-crossing but the character values must not be more than 256 apart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/pattern.html#/%5B%5D |title=Vim documentation: pattern |publisher=Vimdoc.sourceforge.net |accessdate=2013-09-25}}</ref>\n* '''Case insensitivity'''. Some case-insensitivity flags affect only the ASCII characters. Other flags affect all characters. Some engines have two different flags, one for ASCII, the other for Unicode. Exactly which characters belong to the POSIX classes also varies.\n* '''Cousins of case insensitivity'''. As ASCII has case distinction, case insensitivity became a logical feature in text searching. Unicode introduced alphabetic scripts without case like [[Devan\u0101gar\u012b|Devanagari]]. For these, [[case sensitivity]] is not applicable. For scripts like Chinese, another distinction seems logical: between traditional and simplified. In Arabic scripts, insensitivity to [[IMFI|initial, medial, final, and isolated position]] may be desired. In Japanese, insensitivity between [[hiragana]] and [[katakana]] is sometimes useful.\n* '''Normalization'''. Unicode has [[Unicode#Combining characters|combining characters]]. Like old typewriters, plain letters can be followed by one or more non-spacing symbols (usually diacritics like accent marks) to form a single printing character, but also provides precomposed characters, i.e. characters that already include one or more combining characters. A sequence of a character + combining character should be matched with the identical single precomposed character. The process of standardizing sequences of characters + combining characters is called normalization.\n* '''New control codes'''. Unicode introduced amongst others, [[byte order mark]]s and text direction markers. These codes might have to be dealt with in a special way.\n* '''Introduction of character classes for Unicode blocks, scripts, and numerous other character properties'''. Block properties are much less useful than script properties, because a block can have code points from several different scripts, and a script can have code points from several different blocks.<ref name=\"unicode\">{{cite web\n| title = UTS#18 on Unicode Regular Expressions, Annex A: Character Blocks\n| url = http://unicode.org/reports/tr18/#Character_Blocks\n| accessdate = 2010-02-05}}</ref> In [[Perl]] and the {{Javadoc:SE|package=java.util.regex|java/util/regex}} library, properties of the form <code>\\p{InX}</code> or <code>\\p{Block=X}</code> match characters in block ''X'' and <code>\\P{InX}</code> or <code>\\P{Block=X}</code> matches code points not in that block. Similarly, <code>\\p{Armenian}</code>, <code>\\p{IsArmenian}</code>, or <code>\\p{Script=Armenian}</code> matches any character in the Armenian script. In general, <code>\\p{X}</code> matches any character with either the binary property ''X'' or the general category ''X''. For example, <code>\\p{Lu}</code>, <code>\\p{Uppercase_Letter}</code>, or <code>\\p{GC=Lu}</code> matches any uppercase letter. Binary properties that are ''not'' general categories include <code>\\p{White_Space}</code>, <code>\\p{Alphabetic}</code>, <code>\\p{Math}</code>, and <code>\\p{Dash}</code>. Examples of non-binary properties are <code>\\p{Bidi_Class=Right_to_Left}</code>, <code>\\p{Word_Break=A_Letter}</code>, and <code>\\p{Numeric_Value=10}</code>.\n\n==Uses==\nRegexes are useful in a wide variety of [[text processing]] tasks, and more generally [[string processing]], where the data need not be textual. Common applications include [[data validation]], [[data scraping]] (especially [[web scraping]]), [[data wrangling]], simple [[parsing]], the production of [[syntax highlighting]] systems, and many other tasks.\n\nWhile regexes would be useful on Internet [[Search engine (computing)|search engine]]s, processing them across the entire database could consume excessive computer resources depending on the complexity and design of the regex. Although in many cases system administrators can run regex-based queries internally, most search engines do not offer regex support to the public. Notable exceptions: [[Google Code Search]], [[Exalead]]. Google Code Search has been shut down as of January 2012.<ref>{{cite web |first=Bradley |last=Horowitz |author-link=Bradley Horowitz |url=https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/10/fall-sweep.html |title=A fall sweep |date=24 October 2011 |access-date=4 May 2019 |work=[[Google Blog]]}}</ref>\nIt used a trigram index to speed queries.<ref>{{cite web |last=Cox |first=Russ |date=January 2012 |url=https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp4.html |title=Regular Expression Matching with a Trigram Index, or How Google Code Search Worked |access-date=4 May 2019 |work=swtch.com}}</ref>\n\n==Examples==\nThe specific syntax rules vary depending on the specific implementation, [[programming language]], or [[Library (computing)|library]] in use. Additionally, the functionality of regex implementations can vary between [[Software versioning|version]]s.\n\nBecause regexes can be difficult to both explain and understand without examples, interactive websites for testing regexes are a useful resource for learning regexes by experimentation.\nThis section provides a basic description of some of the properties of regexes by way of illustration.\n\nThe following conventions are used in the examples.<ref name=\"clarify000\">The character 'm' is not always required to specify a [[Perl]] match operation. For example, <code>m/[^abc]/</code> could also be rendered as <code>/[^abc]/</code>. The 'm' is only necessary if the user wishes to specify a match operation without using a forward-slash as the regex [[delimiter]]. Sometimes it is useful to specify an alternate regex delimiter in order to avoid \"[[delimiter collision]]\". See '[http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html perldoc perlre]' for more details.</ref>\n\n metacharacter(s) ;; the metacharacters column specifies the regex syntax being demonstrated\n =~ m//           ;; indicates a regex '''match''' operation in Perl\n =~ s///          ;; indicates a regex '''substitution''' operation in Perl\n\nAlso worth noting is that these regexes are all Perl-like syntax. Standard [[#POSIX Basic Regular Expressions|POSIX]] regular expressions are different.\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, the following examples conform to the [[Perl]] programming language, release 5.8.8, January 31, 2006. This means that other implementations may lack support for some parts of the syntax shown here (e.g. basic vs. extended regex, <code>\\( \\)</code> vs. <code>()</code>, or lack of <code>\\d</code> instead of [[POSIX]] <code>[:digit:]</code>).\n\nThe syntax and conventions used in these examples coincide with that of other programming environments as well.<ref>E.g., see ''[[Java (programming language)|Java]] [[O'Reilly Media#In a Nutshell|in a Nutshell]]'', p. 213; ''[[Python (programming language)|Python]] Scripting for Computational Science'', p. 320; Programming [[PHP]], p. 106.</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

This is known as the [[induction of regular languages]], and is part of the general problem of [[grammar induction]] in [[computational learning theory]]. Formally, given examples of strings in a regular language, and perhaps also given examples of strings ''not'' in that regular language, it is possible to induce a grammar for the language, i.e., a regular expression that generates that language. Not all regular languages can be induced in this way (see [[language identification in the limit]]), but many can. For example, the set of examples {1, 10, 100}, and negative set (of counterexamples) {11, 1001, 101, 0} can be used to induce the regular expression 1\u22c50* (1 followed by zero or more 0s).\n\n==See also==\n* [[Comparison of regular-expression engines]]\n* [[Extended Backus\u2013Naur form]]\n* [[Matching wildcards]]\n* [[Regular tree grammar]]\n* [[Thompson's construction]] \u2013 converts a regular expression into an equivalent [[nondeterministic finite automaton|nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA)]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Aho\n | first = Alfred V.\n | author-link =Alfred Aho\n | year = 1990\n | title = Algorithms for finding patterns in strings\n | editor-last = van Leeuwen\n | editor-first = Jan | editor-link = Jan van Leeuwen\n | work = Handbook of Theoretical Computer Science, volume A: Algorithms and Complexity\n | publisher = The MIT Press\n | pages = 255\u2013300\n | ref = harv\n | postscript = <!--None-->\n}}\n* {{cite book\n | last1 = Aho\n | first1 = Alfred V.\n | last2 = Ullman\n | first2 = Jeffrey D.\n | authorlink2 = Jeffrey Ullman\n | year = 1992\n | title = Foundations of Computer Science\n | url = http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/focs.html\n | chapter = Chapter 10.

After his victory at the [[Battle of Wilson's Creek]], [[Sterling Price]] and the [[Missouri State Guard]] moved further north into [[Missouri]].  A force of [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] troops under [[James H. Lane (Senator)|James H. Lane]] moved from [[Fort Scott, Kansas]] to attempt to intercept Price's army, and set an ambush along [[Dry Wood Creek]] in Vernon County.  Price's Missouri State Guard troops outnumbered Lane's [[Kansas]] troops, and forced Lane to retreat to Fort Scott after a two hour skirmish.  In their retreat, Lane's troops abandoned their supplies and mules to the Missourians. Price followed up his victory by continuing his northward march, culminating in the [[Siege of Lexington]].\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|Missouri in the American Civil War}}\n\nAfter the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] in 1861, [[Missouri]] was considered to be a [[Border states (American Civil War)|border state]], as [[Slavery in the United States|slavery was legal]] within the state, but it did not vote to [[Secession in the United States|secede]].  [[Governor of Missouri]] [[Claiborne F. Jackson]] supported the [[Confederate States of America]], and began to use [[militia]] to support the Confederate cause in Missouri by marching towards the [[arsenal]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]].  [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Nathaniel Lyon]], commander of the Union forces in St. Louis, acted quickly by forcing Jackson's militia to surrender in the [[Camp Jackson affair]].  After the debacle at Camp Jackson, Jackson formed a new organization named the [[Missouri State Guard]] and appointed [[Sterling Price]] to command it.  Lyon moved to confront Price's new force, defeating it at the [[Battle of Boonville]].  Price and the Missouri State Guard retreated to the vicinity of [[Springfield, Missouri|Springfield]] in southwestern Missouri, where it was joined by a [[Confederate States Army]] force commanded by Brigadier General [[Benjamin McCulloch]].  On August 10, Lyon decided to attack the combined forces of Price and McCulloch while they were encamped along [[Wilsons Creek, Missouri|Wilsons Creek]], despite being outnumbered by the Confederates and Missourians by a factor of over two-to-one.  In the ensuing [[Battle of Wilson's Creek]], the Union forces were defeated and Lyon was killed.{{sfn|Kennedy|1998|pp=19{{endash}}23}}\n\nAfter Wilson's Creek, the Union army retreated to [[Rolla, Missouri]].  McCulloch and his forces withdrew to [[Arkansas]], and Price's Missouri State Guard occupied Springfield.{{sfn|Monaghan|1984|p=182}}  [[John C. Fremont]] arrived to take control of Union forces in the state, and [[James H. Lane (Senator)|James H. Lane]] took command of several [[Kansas]] regiments stationed at [[Fort Scott, Kansas|Fort Scott]].  Meanwhile, Price began to advance north with a force estimated to number at either 6,000<ref name=\"ohio state\">{{cite web |title=Dry Wood Creek (Big Dry Wood Creek, Battle of the Mules) |url=https://ehistory.osu.edu/battles/dry-wood-creek-big-dry-wood-creek-battle-mules |website=ehistory.osu |publisher=Ohio State University |accessdate=16 March 2020}}</ref> or 10,000 men.{{sfn|Monaghan|1984|p=184}}  In response to Price's incursion, Fremont declared Missouri to be subject to [[martial law]].{{sfn|Monaghan|1984|pp=182\u2013185}}\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Dry Wood Creek Battlefield Missouri.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=Map of Dry Wood Creek Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program|Dry Wood Creek battlefield]]\n\nLane sent his forces, estimated to number either 600<ref name=\"ohio state\" /> or 1,200 men, out to intercept Price's army, and set an ambush along [[Dry Wood Creek]] in [[Vernon County, Missouri]] on September 2.{{sfn|Gerteis|2012|p=99}}  The area around Dry Wood Creek was wooded, giving Lane the element of surprise.  The leading portions of the Missouri State Guard fell into Lane's trap.  Price then brought up more troops, and the Missourians' numerical advantage was a deciding factor in the engagement.  Lane's [[skirmishers]] were driven back from an advanced position, and the main Union force used the covers of the woods to hold of Price for about two hours.  However, Price's men eventually overwhelmed the Kansans, and Lane's troops retreated to Fort Scott.  During the retreat, Lane's men abandoned their supplies and mules to the Missouri State Guard.  Price stated that an important factor in the victory was the fighting experience the Missouri State Guard had gained at Wilson's Creek.{{sfn|Gerteis|2012|pp=99\u2013100}}  The capture of the mules led the battle to be sometimes known as the \"Battle of the Mules\".<ref name=\"ohio state\" /> After defeating Lane, Price's army then headed north to [[Johnson County, Missouri]].{{sfn|Gerteis|2012|p=100}}\n\nIn a report filed after the battle, Lane states that his forces lost five men killed and six wounded.<ref name=\"lane battle report\">{{cite web |last1=Lane |first1=James H. |title=Action at Dry Wood Creek |url=https://ehistory.osu.edu/books/official-records/003/0163 |website=ehistory.osu.edu |publisher=Ohio State University |accessdate=16 March 2020}}</ref>  In his post-action report, Price estimated his loss to be two men killed and twenty-three wounded, although he noted that most of the wounds were not serious.<ref name=\"official records\">{{cite web |title=The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies: Series 1, Volume 53 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=coo.31924080779543&view=1up&seq=443 |website=babel.hathitrust.org |publisher=United States War Department |accessdate=16 March 2020 |pages=435{{endash}}436}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath and legacy==\nAfter reaching Johnson County, Price continued to [[Lexington, Missouri]], where a Union garrison was defending the town.

After his victory at the [[Battle of Wilson's Creek]], [[Sterling Price]] and the [[Missouri State Guard]] moved further north into [[Missouri]].  A force of [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] troops under [[James H. Lane (Senator)|James H. Lane]] moved from [[Fort Scott, Kansas]] to attempt to intercept Price's army, and set an ambush along [[Dry Wood Creek]] in Vernon County.  Price's Missouri State Guard troops outnumbered Lane's [[Kansas]] troops, and forced Lane to retreat to Fort Scott after a two hour skirmish.  In their retreat, Lane's troops abandoned their supplies and mules to the Missourians. Price followed up his victory by continuing his northward march, culminating in the [[Siege of Lexington]].\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|Missouri in the American Civil War}}\n\nAfter the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] in 1861, [[Missouri]] was considered to be a [[Border states (American Civil War)|border state]], as [[Slavery in the United States|slavery was legal]] within the state, but it did not vote to [[Secession in the United States|secede]].  [[Governor of Missouri]] [[Claiborne F. Jackson]] supported the [[Confederate States of America]], and began to use [[militia]] to support the Confederate cause in Missouri by marching towards the [[arsenal]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]].  [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Nathaniel Lyon]], commander of the Union forces in St. Louis, acted quickly by forcing Jackson's militia to surrender in the [[Camp Jackson affair]].  After the debacle at Camp Jackson, Jackson formed a new organization named the [[Missouri State Guard]] and appointed [[Sterling Price]] to command it.  Lyon moved to confront Price's new force, defeating it at the [[Battle of Boonville]].  Price and the Missouri State Guard retreated to the vicinity of [[Springfield, Missouri|Springfield]] in southwestern Missouri, where it was joined by a [[Confederate States Army]] force commanded by Brigadier General [[Benjamin McCulloch]].  On August 10, Lyon decided to attack the combined forces of Price and McCulloch while they were encamped along [[Wilsons Creek, Missouri|Wilsons Creek]], despite being outnumbered by the Confederates and Missourians by a factor of over two-to-one.  In the ensuing [[Battle of Wilson's Creek]], the Union forces were defeated and Lyon killed.{{sfn|Kennedy|1998|pp=19{{endash}}23}}\n\nAfter Wilson's Creek, the Union army retreated to [[Rolla, Missouri]].  McCulloch and his forces withdrew to [[Arkansas]], and Price's Missouri State Guard occupied Springfield.{{sfn|Monaghan|1984|p=182}}  [[John C. Fremont]] arrived to take control of Union forces in the state, and [[James H. Lane (Senator)|James H.

The leading portions of the Missouri State Guard fell into Lane's trap.  Price then brought up more troops, and the Missourians' numerical advantage was a deciding factor in the engagement.  Lane's [[skirmishers]] were driven back from an advanced position, and the main Union force used the covers of the woods to hold of Price for about two hours.  However, Price's men eventually overwhelmed the Kansans, and Lane's troops retreated to Fort Scott.  During the retreat, Lane's men abandoned their supplies and mules to the Missouri State Guard.  Price stated that an important factor in the victory was the fighting experience the Missouri State Guard had gained at Wilson's Creek.{{sfn|Gerteis|2012|pp=99\u2013100}}  The capture of the mules led the battle to be sometimes known as the \"Battle of the Mules\".<ref name=\"ohio state\" /> After defeating Lane, Price's army then headed north to [[Johnson County, Missouri]].{{sfn|Gerteis|2012|p=100}}\n\nIn a report filed after the battle, Lane states that his forces lost five men killed and six wounded.<ref name=\"lane battle report\">{{cite web |last1=Lane |first1=James H. |title=Action at Dry Wood Creek |url=https://ehistory.osu.edu/books/official-records/003/0163 |website=ehistory.osu.edu |publisher=Ohio State University |accessdate=16 March 2020}}</ref>  In his post-action report, Price estimated his loss to be two men killed and twenty-three wounded, although he noted that most of the wounds were not serious.<ref name=\"official records\">{{cite web |title=The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies: Series 1, Volume 53 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=coo.31924080779543&view=1up&seq=443 |website=babel.hathitrust.org |publisher=United States War Department |accessdate=16 March 2020 |pages=435{{endash}}436}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath and legacy==\nAfter reaching Johnson County, Price continued to [[Lexington, Missouri]], where a Union garrison was defending the town.

The [[Spanish Empire|Spanish crown]] restricted immigration to its overseas possessions to Catholics with \"pure\" ancestry, (''[[limpieza de sangre]]''),  that is, without taint of Jewish or Muslim ancestors. Prospective immigrants had to obtain a license from the [[Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n|House of Trade]] in Seville, Spain, attesting to their religious status and ancestry. So-called [[New Christians]], that is Jewish converts to Catholicism, were forbidden from immigrating for fear they had falsely claimed conversion and were in fact [[crypto-Jews]] passing as Christians.<ref>Fisher, John R. \"Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n\" in ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'', vol. 1, pp.&nbsp;589\u201390. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996.</ref> During the period when Spain and Portugal had the same monarch (1580-1640), many Portuguese merchants immigrated to Mexico. Religious authorities suspected they were crypto-Jews. The [[Mexican Inquisition]] was established in 1571 and arrested, tried, and then turned those convicted over to civil authorities for corporal, sometimes capital, punishment in [[auto de fe|autos de fe]].\n\nEarly Spanish immigrants to Mexico included men who became crown or ecclesiastical officials, those with connections to the privileged group of conquerors who had access to indigenous labor and tribute via the [[encomienda]], but also Spaniards who saw economic opportunity in Mexico. Not all Spaniards were of noble heritage ([[hidalgo|hidalgos]]); many were merchants and miners, as well as artisans of various types. Spanish women immigrated from the conquest era onward, most usually because they joined family members who had already immigrated. Their presence helped consolidate the Spanish colony. Spaniards founded cities, sometimes on the sites of indigenous cities, the most prominent being [[Mexico City]] founded on the ruins of Aztec [[Tenochtitlan]]. Spaniards preferred living in cities and with so many immigrant artisans present from an early period, Spanish material culture was replicated in Mexico by tailors, leather workers, bakers, makers of weapons, construction workers, book sellers, and medical specialists (barber-surgeons). In 1550, of the 8,000 Spanish immigrants in Mexico City, around ten percent were artisans.<ref>Altman, Ida. \"Spanish Society in Mexico City After the Conquest.\" Hispanic American Historical Review'' (1991)71(3):413-45.</ref><ref>Altman, Ida et al.

After the fall of [[First Mexican Empire|the monarchy]] of Agust\u00edn de Iturbide in 1823, the newly established [[Constitution of 1824|federal republic]] promulgated a new law regarding immigration, the [[General Colonization Law]]. The Spanish crown's controls over foreigners doing business in Mexico were no longer in place, and some British businessmen took an interest in silver mining in northern Mexico.<ref>Villalobos Vel\u00e1squez, Rosario.

The Mexican government gave a license to [[Stephen F. Austin]] to colonize areas in Texas, with the proviso that they be or become Catholics and learn Spanish, largely honored in the breach as more and more settlers arrived. Most settlers were from the slave-holding areas of the southern U.S. and brought their slaves with them to cultivate the rich soil of east Texas. The experiment in colonization in Texas went disastrously wrong for Mexico, with Anglo-Texans and some Mexican [[Texian]]s rebelling against Mexico's central government and gaining defacto [[Texas Revolution|independence]] in 1836.  However, Mexicans of various ideological stripes called for  attracting immigrants to Mexico in the nineteenth century.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the [[American Civil War]] (1861-1865), a number of Southerners from the failed [[Confederate States of America]] moved to Mexico.<ref>Wahlstrom, Todd W. ''The Southern Exodus to Mexico: Migration Across the Borderlands After the American Civil War''.

Some did assimilate culturally, learning Spanish and sometimes marrying into elite Mexican families, but many others kept a separate identity and U.S. citizenship.<ref>Hart, John Mason. ''Empire and Revolution: The Americans in Mexico since the Civil War''. Berkeley: University of California Press 2002.</ref> British, French, and German immigrants also became distinct immigrant groups during the [[Porfiriato]].\n\nMass [[Chinese immigration to Mexico]] began in the 1876, following mass single-male migrations to Cuba and to Peru where they worked as field laborers [[coolies]]. Chinese men immigrated mainly to northern Mexico, and the flow of migration increased following the passage of the 1882 [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] in the U.S. Some then entered the U.S. illegally, but many more stayed in the borderlands area on the Mexican side, where they entered commerce as entrepreneurs of small-scale businesses, creating dry-goods stores and laundries in mining and agricultural towns, as well as small-scale manufacturing and truck farming. They came to monopolize the small-business sector. Chinese merchant houses were established in Pacific coast ports, such as [[Guaymas]], hiring their country-men. There was significant anti-Chinese feeling in northern Mexico, which intensified during the Mexican Revolution.<ref>Hu-Dehart, Evelyn. \"Racism and Anti-Chinese Persecution in Mexico.\" Amerasia  9:2 (1982).</ref> They were expelled from Sonora in the 1930s and their businesses nationalized.<ref>Hu-Dehart, Evelyn. \"Chinese\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'' .

It replaces the two large immigration categories\u2014immigrant and nonimmigrant\u2014with the categories of \u201cvisitor\u201d and \u201ctemporary resident\u201d, while keeping the status of \u201cpermanent resident\u201d. In the General Law of Population the two categories incorporate over 30 different types of foreigners\u2014i.e. distinguished visitor, religious minister, etc.\u2014each with its own stipulations and requirements to qualify for entry and stay. Under the new law the requirements are simplified, basically differentiating those foreigners who are allowed to work and those who are not. The law also expedites the permanent resident application process for retirees and other foreigners.

The [[Spanish Empire|Spanish crown]] restricted immigration to its overseas possessions to Catholics with \"pure\" ancestry, (''[[limpieza de sangre]]''),  that is, without taint of Jewish or Muslim ancestors. Prospective immigrants had to obtain a license from the [[Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n|House of Trade]] in Seville, Spain, attesting to their religious status and ancestry. So-called [[New Christians]], that is Jewish converts to Catholicism, were forbidden from immigrating for fear they had falsely claimed conversion and were in fact [[crypto-Jews]] passing as Christians.<ref>Fisher, John R. \"Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n\" in ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'', vol. 1, pp.&nbsp;589\u201390. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996.</ref> During the period when Spain and Portugal had the same monarch (1580-1640), many Portuguese merchants immigrated to Mexico. Religious authorities suspected they were crypto-Jews. The [[Mexican Inquisition]] was established in 1571 and arrested, tried, and then turned those convicted over to civil authorities for corporal, sometimes capital, punishment in [[auto de fe|autos de fe]].\n\nEarly Spanish immigrants to Mexico included men who became crown or ecclesiastical officials, those with connections to the privileged group of conquerors who had access to indigenous labor and tribute via the [[encomienda]], but also Spaniards who saw economic opportunity in Mexico. Not all Spaniards were of noble heritage ([[hidalgo|hidalgos]]); many were merchants and miners, as well as artisans of various types. Spanish women immigrated from the conquest era onward, most usually because they joined family members who had already immigrated. Their presence helped consolidate the Spanish colony. Spaniards founded cities, sometimes on the sites of indigenous cities, the most prominent being [[Mexico City]] founded on the ruins of Aztec [[Tenochtitlan]]. Spaniards preferred living in cities and with so many immigrant artisans present from an early period, Spanish material culture was replicated in Mexico by tailors, leather workers, bakers, makers of weapons, construction workers, book sellers, and medical specialists (barber-surgeons). In 1550, of the 8,000 Spanish immigrants in Mexico City, around ten percent were artisans.<ref>Altman, Ida. \"Spanish Society in Mexico City After the Conquest.\" Hispanic American Historical Review'' (1991)71(3):413-45.</ref><ref>Altman, Ida et al.

Except for the Portuguese, many of these other Europeans assimilated into larger Hispanic society.<ref>Altman, ''The Early History of Greater Mexico'', p. 263.</ref> Seventeenth-century English Dominican friar [[Thomas Gage (priest)|Thomas Gage]] spent a few years in central Mexico and Guatemala and wrote a colorful memoir of his time there, but he returned to England and renounced Catholicism.<ref>''Thomas Gage's Travels in the New World'', J.E.S.

After the fall of [[First Mexican Empire|the monarchy]] of Agust\u00edn de Iturbide in 1823, the newly established [[Constitution of 1824|federal republic]] promulgated a new law regarding immigration, the [[General Colonization Law]]. The Spanish crown's controls over foreigners doing business in Mexico were no longer in place, and some British businessmen took an interest in silver mining in northern Mexico.<ref>Villalobos Vel\u00e1squez, Rosario.

Mexico City: The British Council/Archivo Hist\u00f3rico y Museo Miner\u00eda 2004.</ref> The Mexican government sought to populate areas of the north as a buffer against indigenous attacks. The Mexican government gave a license to [[Stephen F. Austin]] to colonize areas in Texas, with the proviso that they be or become Catholics and learn Spanish, largely honored in the breach as more and more settlers arrived. Most settlers were from the slave-holding areas of the southern U.S. and brought their slaves with them to cultivate the rich soil of east Texas. The experiment in colonization in Texas went disastrously wrong for Mexico, with Anglo-Texans and some Mexican [[Texian]]s rebelling against Mexico's central government and gaining defacto [[Texas Revolution|independence]] in 1836.  However, Mexicans of various ideological stripes called for  attracting immigrants to Mexico in the nineteenth century.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the [[American Civil War]] (1861-1865), a number of Southerners from the failed [[Confederate States of America]] moved to Mexico.<ref>Wahlstrom, Todd W. ''The Southern Exodus to Mexico: Migration Across the Borderlands After the American Civil War''. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2015.</ref>  Another group migrating to Mexico were [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Mexico|Mormons]], who sought religious freedom to practice polygamy, and founded colonies in northern Mexico.<ref>Hardy, B.

Carmon. \"Cultural\" Encystment\" as a Cause of the Mormon Exodus from Mexico in 1912.\" Pacific Historical Review 34.4 (1965): 439-454.</ref>\n\nDuring the late nineteenth century when Mexican President [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]] (r.1876-1800, 1884-1911) pursued a policy of modernization and development, many from the U.S. settled in Mexico, pursuing roles as financiers, industrialists, investors, and agri-business investors, and farmers. Some did assimilate culturally, learning Spanish and sometimes marrying into elite Mexican families, but many others kept a separate identity and U.S. citizenship.<ref>Hart, John Mason. ''Empire and Revolution: The Americans in Mexico since the Civil War''. Berkeley: University of California Press 2002.</ref> British, French, and German immigrants also became distinct immigrant groups during the [[Porfiriato]].\n\nMass [[Chinese immigration to Mexico]] began in the 1876, following mass single-male migrations to Cuba and to Peru where they worked as field laborers [[coolies]]. Chinese men immigrated mainly to northern Mexico, and the flow of migration increased following the passage of the 1882 [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] in the U.S. Some then entered the U.S. illegally, but many more stayed in the borderlands area on the Mexican side, where they entered commerce as entrepreneurs of small-scale businesses, creating dry-goods stores and laundries in mining and agricultural towns, as well as small-scale manufacturing and truck farming. They came to monopolize the small-business sector. Chinese merchant houses were established in Pacific coast ports, such as [[Guaymas]], hiring their country-men. There was significant anti-Chinese feeling in northern Mexico, which intensified during the Mexican Revolution.<ref>Hu-Dehart, Evelyn. \"Racism and Anti-Chinese Persecution in Mexico.\" Amerasia  9:2 (1982).</ref> They were expelled from Sonora in the 1930s and their businesses nationalized.<ref>Hu-Dehart, Evelyn. \"Chinese\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'' .

It replaces the two large immigration categories\u2014immigrant and nonimmigrant\u2014with the categories of \u201cvisitor\u201d and \u201ctemporary resident\u201d, while keeping the status of \u201cpermanent resident\u201d. In the General Law of Population the two categories incorporate over 30 different types of foreigners\u2014i.e. distinguished visitor, religious minister, etc.\u2014each with its own stipulations and requirements to qualify for entry and stay. Under the new law the requirements are simplified, basically differentiating those foreigners who are allowed to work and those who are not. The law also expedites the permanent resident application process for retirees and other foreigners. For granting permanent residency, the law proposes using a point system based on factors such as level of education, employment experience, and scientific and technological knowledge.<ref>Gonzalez-Murphy, Laura. \"Protecting Immigrant Rights in Mexico: Understanding the State-Civil Society Nexus,\"  Routledge, New York, Forthcoming 2013</ref>\n\nAccording to Article 81 of the Law and Article 70 of the regulations to the law\u2014published on 28 September 2012\u2014 immigration officials are the only ones that can conduct immigration procedures although the Federal Police may assist but only under the request and guidance of the Institute of Migration. Verification procedures cannot be conducted in migrant shelters run by civil society organizations or by individuals that engage in providing humanitarian assistance to immigrants.\n\nUndocumented immigration has been a problem for Mexico, especially since the 1970s.

The followers of this religion address the founder as \"Meivazhi Salai Aandavargal ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0bae\u0bc6\u0baf\u0bcd\u0bb5\u0bb4\u0bbf \u0b9a\u0bbe\u0bb2\u0bc8 \u0b86\u0ba3\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bb5\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bcd meyva\u1e3bi C\u0101lai \u0101\u1e47\u1e6davarka\u1e37)\". The main source of the early life and history of Salai Aandavargal are mostly extracted from the Meivazhi scriptures written by the early followers of the religion and also from contents written by Salai Aandavargal himself.\n\n=== Biography of Salai Aandavargal ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\n\"Aadhi Maanmiyam ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0b86\u0ba4\u0bbf \u0bae\u0bbe\u0ba3\u0bcd\u0bae\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bae\u0bcd)\", one of the volumes of Meivazhi scriptures, narrates the real name, early life and experiences of Salai Andavargal. According to the scripture, Aandavargal was born in 1857 at Markampatti, a village in Oddanchatram Taluk, [[Dindigul district]], [[Tamil Nadu]]. He was named Khader Badsha Rowther by his parents - his father being Jamal Hussain Rowther and mother Periya Thayi. He had his primary education in the village elementary school and followed the profession of his father as an agriculturist. As a youth, he had a keen interest in spirituality. He met many false gurus and initially believed that [[hatha yoga]] was the only way to achieve the highest spiritual realization. But he realized later that people were pretending to be saints for the sake of earning money and their own selfish purposes. He migrated to Kasukkaranpalayam, a village in Perundurai taluk, [[Erode]] in [[Tamil Nadu]] after his marriage to Suleka Bivi and worked as a wholesale paddy merchant. He had a daughter named Aisuamma and he almost gave up on spirituality. But It was during this period, that he met his [[satguru]] Shri Thanigai Mani Piran (real name is Mohamed Saligh also known as Pattaiyar), who was stated to be more than 600 years old and who revealed to Salai Aandavargal about his true form. Shri Thanigai Mani Piran was also the GURU of [[Ramalinga Swamigal]]. He baptized Salai Aandavargal through Brahmopadhesam ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0baa\u0bcd\u0bb0\u0bb9\u0bcd\u0bae\u0bcb\u0baa\u0bbe\u0ba4\u0bc7\u0b9a\u0bae\u0bcd Prahm\u014dp\u0101t\u0113cam), the spiritual rebirth, at Kasukkaranpalayam, [[Erode]]. Thereafter, Salai Aandavargal followed his satguru all over South India, renouncing his profession, wife, children and everything to attain the highest spiritual enlightenment. When Aandavargal finished his travels with his guru, he was ordered to tend to a flock of sheep at Reddiyapatti village in [[Dindigul]] district for a year. This is celebrated annually as the \"([[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0b86\u0b9f\u0bc1 \u0bae\u0bc7\u0baf\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bc1 \u0ba4\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bcb\u0bb2\u0b95\u0bcd \u0b95\u0bbe\u0b9f\u0bcd\u0b9a\u0bbf \u0100\u1e6du m\u0113yppu tirukk\u014dlak k\u0101\u1e6dci)\" festival. The first meeting of Salai Andavargal and his guru is celebrated by the followers as a festival during [[Purnima|pournami day]] of the [[Panguni Uthiram|Panguni]] month (April), as the \"([[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0baa\u0bbf\u0bb1\u0bb5\u0bbe \u0ba8\u0bbe\u0bb3\u0bcd \u0baa\u0bbf\u0bb1\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bc1 \u0ba4\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0ba8\u0bbe\u0bb3\u0bcd Pi\u1e5fav\u0101 n\u0101\u1e37 pi\u1e5fappu tirun\u0101\u1e37)\" festival.\n\n=== Tapas ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\nThereafter he was directed to observe severe [[Tapas (Sanskrit)|Tapas]] in the cave on the western side of [[Thiruparankundram]] hill (near [[Madurai]]) which he carried out for many years the wakefulness and near starvation diet of Prickly pear. Thereby he acquired divine symbols (sannadams) in his sacred hand \u2013 such us [[Udukai]], [[Trishula]], [[Shankhu]], [[Sudarshana Chakra]], Villu, Vaal, [[Gada (mace)]], Angusam, Paasam, Modhagam, [[Vel]] and finally the \u201cKhill Namam\" (Crescent moon). The Crescent moon is the ultimate divine symbol, which is now used by his followers as their religion's righteous symbol. Aandavargal acquiring the holy symbol is commemorated by celebrating the festival of \u201c([[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0b95\u0bcb\u0b9f\u0bbe\u0baf\u0bc1\u0ba4 \u0b9a\u0ba9\u0bcd\u0ba9\u0ba4\u0ba4\u0bcd \u0ba4\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bbe\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bc1 \u0b95\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95\u0ba8\u0ba4\u0bcd \u0ba4\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0ba8\u0bbe\u0bb3\u0bcd Kodaayudha Sannathath Thirukkappu Kangganath Thirunall) in the month of [[Vaisakha|Vaikasi]] (June).\n\nWhen the savant understood that his disciple Salai Andavargal is fully endowed with wit and power to commence his holy mission \u201cMeivazhi\u201d(True Path), he christened him \u201cMaarganadhar\u201d and departed from him after persuading Salai Andavargal to proceed forward alone in his holy mission.\n\nCladding himself in a saffron robe, Andavargal first preached to [[Sannyasa|sanyasis]] and Saints, but thereupon he understood that most of the sanyasis were impostors not because of their ignorance but deliberation to loot innocent people's money for satisfying their lust and hunger. Finally, Andavargal gave up the garb of sanyasi and took to preaching family people engaged in worldly occupations. Later at Tiruppattur in [[Sivaganga]] district, [[Tamil Nadu]], he married Panimathi Nachiyar as per his Guru's wish.\n\n=== Religious attributes of Salai Aandavargal ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\nIt is claimed that the Heavenly Tokens which distinguish Meivazhi Salai Andavargal from the mushrooms of impostors, masquerading as master all over the world, and identify him as the only true Master of the Age, are:\n*that he has conquered slumber and sleep.\n*that his Breath never passes out of His nostrils.\n*that he has practically overcome the need for food.\n\n=== Goal of Meivazhi ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\n# Meivazhi Salai Aandavargal's mission, unparalleled in the history of the spiritual hierarchy, consists of bringing home to man the Lost truth that the very purpose of religion is to rescue him from the death-throes, eradicating the falsehoods and half-truths about religions among many other spiritual values.\n# Baptizing with the spirit, thereby enlightening and expanding the dark and constricted heart and opening the vistas of soul, a series of eternal revelations;\n# Warning against the impending disaster and destruction, the whole universe is facing.\n# Offering mankind a helping hand to escape the 'sting of death' and to win the 'victory of the grave', and\n# Resurrecting the dead even many days after their final departure from the mortal coil to reach their rendezvous (heavenly destination), which is the Abode of Bliss.\n\n==Beliefs of Meivazhi==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\nMan is an Astral being originally created by God in Heaven along with all the other Angels. But, as explained by every major religion which came upon Earth, Man was banished from Heaven after consuming a fruit created by Satan despite God's warnings, ending in a cursed state, containing both Good and Evil, within himself. Consequently, Man became unfit for living in Heaven and sent to Earth for a period of repentance. Man has been living on Earth ever since and so was Satan. God had always reminded Man that both Good and Evil exists within himself and that all he had to do to, was get in touch with his good side to reach God and Heaven. Man was given a choice to choose whichever he wanted. He could choose the Good side to reach God or otherwise, he could stay on Earth. Satan, who was more powerful than mankind and not visible to the cursed human form, was also banished to Earth and had shown no signs of repentance ever since. Satan has been corrupting mankind in whatever ways possible to prevent mankind from going back to Heaven. Most of the sufferings faced by Mankind are not because of God, but the absence of God, which emboldens Satan to wreak havoc among mankind and rule over the Earth.\n\nDuring the initial days on Earth, known as the [[Satya Yuga]], Mankind was well aware of their descent and was well-connected with God. Therefore, Satan was well under control. Satan never went anywhere close to mankind when they were in touch with God. However, when mankind forgets their origins and God, Satan gets an opportunity to corrupt them and use them for perpetuating evil deeds. The Satya Yuga came to an end and [[Treta Yuga]] started, when a portion of Mankind started to forget their origins and Satan successfully infiltrated them. Subsequently, the [[Dvapara Yuga]] saw a majority of mankind forgetting their origin and many of them were corrupted by Satan, manipulating them to believe in worldly ideas and lust after materialistic possessions, provoking them to commit heinous sins and fight amongst themselves for obtaining worldly possessions.\n\nGod had noticed these developments all along and knew that Mankind had no chance against Satan by themselves and would definitely need guidance. Therefore, God along with several other Angels had always been on Earth under various identities amongst different sectors of mankind spread across various continents, teaching them their true origin. All the different identities were shadows of the same God. All the religion in the world were started with the only purpose of making mankind realize their origins and to reach back to the one God who created them.\n\nBut despite God's efforts, Satan was also living amongst mankind during all those times, and had actively worked against the teachings of God, manipulating mankind to believe in multiple religious beliefs, multiple gods and fragmented them into different groups. Satan had managed to manipulate mankind, and create chaos amongst mankind, making them believe in multiple Gods and pitted followers of one fragment against each other. This led to utter chaos and mankind would no longer believe even the true God. Religion became a mere mockery serving no purpose. A large portion of Mankind was following religions only in name, but do not know its purpose nor they know the true God. Mankind was obsessed with materialistic possessions, totally unaware of their astral origin.\n\nTo make things worse, many Angels sent by God in the human form were tortured and even crucified by the corrupted mankind, because of disbelief and hatred under the influence of Satan. This led to the beginning of the [[Kali Yuga]], where many angels feared visiting earth due to the extent of torture meted out by mankind and most angels had returned to Heaven declaring the mankind ungrateful. The Crucification of an angel was a turning point, where God decided to put an end to Satan by destroying its world and banish it to Hell along with its followers. However, God decided to give a final opportunity to mankind before putting an end to Satan and its followers. Therefore, God, who had visiting mankind under 9 identities since the Satya Yuga, decided to visit mankind, for the final time to make them understand their true nature and their destiny. Many angels had prophesied this visit as the beginning of the Kalki Yuga, popularly explained under [[Kalki Purana]].\n\nIt is absolutely believed that Meivazhi Salai marks the beginning of this Kalki Yuga, where its founder had united almost every major religion such a Hinduism, Christianity, Islam, etc... into one community, which is no ordinary feat. Meivazhi religion preaches the oneness of all religion at its core and the true purpose of every religion on earth. Further, Meivazhi Salai strives to make mankind realize the forgotten origins and destiny of mankind to reach Heaven. Meivazhi religion constantly reminds its followers that God and evil are both within themselves and to always remember the true God at Heart, to reach Heaven. Also, its founder had instructed the followers to not worship his statues or photos, which are merely a temporary identity of god and not the god himself. Therefore, the followers of Meivazhi do not worship any statues or photos. The Meivazhi Religion teaches its followers that the only thing mankind ought to pray to God is for protecting their soul from Satan and not for any other materialistic possessions.\n\nIt is believed that the sign that a Man has reached God is that the person's physical self will become [[Incorruptibility|incorruptible]] when he dies. The soul will rest within oneself during death and hence, the person shows signs of incorruptibility. Although this may sound very strange for a majority of people, this incorruptibility very commonly occurs to the followers of the Meivazhi religion. There were instances where even non-followers, who had visited the Meivazhi Salai and prayed, acknowledging the God within themselves, have shown signs of incorruptibility. It is believed that most non-followers follow a religion, which is lost and followed only in name without even knowing that God lies within himself. People search for God in the skies, oceans, rocks and everywhere, unaware of the whereabouts of true God, and die without fulfilling their most basic purpose of finding God within their lifetime. When this happens, their soul leaves their physical selves in search of God everywhere else and will either be reborn or enslaved by Satan. Eventually, their body will decompose. But when their soul settles within themselves and reaches God, the body will never decompose, as seen in many saints.\n\n===End of the world prophecy===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\nAs stated by every other major religion on Earth, the Meivazhi religion also reiterates the end of the world prophecies and the destruction of the world during the Kali Yuga, and it is further believed by its followers that the Kali Yuga, the final phase of the world has already started. \n\n== Claims of incorruptibility ==\nThe Followers of Meivazhi believe that a person's attainment of Heaven or Hell can be ascertained by their body, by observing 10 signs after death showing Immortal Proofs of Salvation at the time of death, as said to be happening in Meivazhi, showing real majestic victory over the force of death:\n* No bad stench of the body showing only pleasant aroma of the body. No discharge of foul-smelling liquid.\n* No stiffening of the body, thus showing signs of the flexibility of parts.\n* The body will be light in weight like a flower-basket.\n* The body sweats as the time passes.\n* The complete body exhibits warmness.\n* The natural conditions of the throat path. Hence the body takes in the Holy Water when given.\n* The knuckles giving out sound when cracked, all continuing in the living state.\n* The disappearance of deformities such as hunchback, with which they may have been afflicted.\n* The pure and pleasant state of the body reflecting youthfulness and cheeriness blooming on the face.\n* The body does not decay after death and also, the earth does not affect the body.\n\n== Meivazhi Scriptures ==\nMeivazhi has its own Holy scriptures running up to four volumes in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] language.\n\n* Volume I ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0b86\u0ba4\u0bbf \u0bae\u0bc6\u0baf\u0bcd \u0b89\u0ba4\u0baf \u0baa\u0bc2\u0bb0\u0ba3 \u0bb5\u0bc7\u0ba4\u0bbe\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bae\u0bcd \u0100ti mey utaya p\u016bra\u1e47a v\u0113t\u0101ntam) \n* Volume II ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0b86\u0ba3\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bb5\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bcd \u0bae\u0bbe\u0ba9\u0bcd\u0bae\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bae\u0bcd \u0100\u1e47\u1e6davarka\u1e37 m\u0101\u1e49miyam)\n* Volume III ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0b8e\u0bae\u0ba9\u0bcd \u0baa\u0b9f\u0bb0\u0bcd \u0b85\u0b9f\u0bbf\u0baa\u0b9f\u0bc1 \u0b95\u0bca\u0b9f\u0bbe\u0baf\u0bc2\u0ba4\u0b95\u0bcd \u0b95\u0bc2\u0bb0\u0bcd Ema\u1e49 pa\u1e6dar a\u1e6dipa\u1e6du ko\u1e6d\u0101y\u016btak k\u016br)\n* Volume IV ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0b8e\u0bae\u0ba9\u0bcd \u0baa\u0b9f\u0bb0\u0bcd \u0b85\u0b9f\u0bbf\u0baa\u0b9f\u0bc1 \u0ba4\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bc1 \u0bae\u0bc6\u0baf\u0bcd\u0b9e\u0bcd\u0b9e\u0bbe\u0ba9\u0b95\u0bcd \u0b95\u0bca\u0bb0\u0bb2\u0bcd Ema\u1e49 pa\u1e6dar a\u1e6dipa\u1e6du tiru mey\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e49ak koral)\n\n== Meivazhi Sabha ==\nThe first Meivazhi Ashram was founded at Rajagambeeram village in [[Sivaganga district]], [[Tamil Nadu]]. In one of the Meivazhi Vedas, namely \"Aadhi Maanmiyam\", at Chapter 2, page 7, it is stated that the Village Rajagambeeram was previously known as [[Shambhala]] during the times of [[Narada]]. The second Meivazhi Asharam was started at [[Tirupathur, Sivaganga|Tirupathur]], a panchayat town in  [[Sivaganga district]], [[Tamil Nadu]], where the Sabha was initially registered on 19 June 1933. From small beginnings, the number of followers gradually increased, year by year. By 1939, the sabha was shifted to Madurai (Aruppukottai Road). But in 1942, during the Second World War, the British Government acquired the entire place in Madurai and paid a compensation of Rs.1,37,750.00 to Meivazhi Sabha. Consequently, the sabha had to be shifted to a different place. The prophetic carvings encoded in the lentil stones of the Ashram hall, inscribed in the year 1940 reads \"\u0b86\u0bb2\u0baf\u0bae\u0bcd \u0bae\u0bbe\u0bb1 \u0b85\u0bb0\u0b9a\u0bc1 \u0bae\u0bbe\u0bb1\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd\" (Change of Government with the change of Temple\u2019) in the old Meivazhi Ashram (in the Madurai Aerodrome campus) remains as a monument. The sabha was later shifted to a land at Pappancahivayal, [[Pudukkottai district]], [[Tamil Nadu]] where Aandavargal purchased a jungle land for about Rs.6,000.00 and cleared it for habitation. The sabha was re-registered on 10 June 1944 in the, then Pudukkottai State, where it has been functioning ever since. This place is the present [[Meivazhi Salai]]. The Control of the Sabha was under Meivazhi Salai Aandavargal till 1976, after which he entered a very deep meditative state. The place where he started meditating has become a shrine for the followers of Meivazhi and is called as the \"Ponnaranga Devalayam ([[Tamil Language|Tamil]]: \u0baa\u0bca\u0ba9\u0bcd\u0ba9\u0bb0\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95 \u0ba4\u0bc7\u0bb5\u0bbe\u0bb2\u0baf\u0bae\u0bcd, Po\u1e49\u1e49ara\u1e45ka t\u0113v\u0101layam), meaning \"The Golden Temple\". All the Prayers, Rituals and Festivals are held around this Shrine. The followers faced a credibility crisis in March 1976, when Customs and Excise Department officers raided the hermitage in a weeklong operation that unearthed gold and silver ornaments from the Pudukottai campus. The government sued them for illegal hoarding of wealth, but eventually it lost the case.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Dress code for entering the Ashram ===\nMeivazhi followers have a mandatory dress code for entering the ashram. Men who have received the upadhesam, the highest level of spiritual teaching (known as Anandars), wear saffron shirts and traditional Hindu panchakacham trousers. Males who have not received it wear white turbans and clothes other than saffron, and in dark colours. Women who have received upadhesam wear sarees and cover their head with a saffron scarf, while other women cover their head with the end of the sarees.\n\n=== Practices and rituals===\nThe followers of Meivazhi do not worship any idols, tombs or any materialistic subjects, but they focus on the god within themselves whenever they pray. The rituals and festivals, which take place near the temple are merely a reminder for its followers to always focus on the god within them and to never forget the god who created them. Daily rituals take place around-the-clock at the Ponnaranga Devalayam, throughout the year. The most significant prayer ritual for the followers is the evening one, which is attended by the most people on any given day. The followers refer to the prayer rituals as 'Vanakkam ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0bb5\u0ba3\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bae\u0bcd Va\u1e47akkam)', literally meaning 'Hello' or 'Greeting' in English, possibly referring to the meeting of Human soul with the God.\n\n1.

The followers of this religion address the founder as \"Meivazhi Salai Aandavargal ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0bae\u0bc6\u0baf\u0bcd\u0bb5\u0bb4\u0bbf \u0b9a\u0bbe\u0bb2\u0bc8 \u0b86\u0ba3\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bb5\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bcd meyva\u1e3bi C\u0101lai \u0101\u1e47\u1e6davarka\u1e37)\". The main source of the early life and history of Salai Aandavargal are mostly extracted from the Meivazhi scriptures written by the early followers of the religion and also from contents written by Salai Aandavargal himself.\n\n=== Biography of Salai Aandavargal ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\n\"Aadhi Maanmiyam ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0b86\u0ba4\u0bbf \u0bae\u0bbe\u0ba3\u0bcd\u0bae\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bae\u0bcd)\", one of the volumes of Meivazhi scriptures, narrates the real name, early life and experiences of Salai Andavargal. According to the scripture, Aandavargal was born in 1857 at Markampatti, a village in Oddanchatram Taluk, [[Dindigul district]], [[Tamil Nadu]]. He was named Khader Badsha Rowther by his parents - his father being Jamal Hussain Rowther and mother Periya Thayi. He had his primary education in the village elementary school and followed the profession of his father as an agriculturist. As a youth, he had a keen interest in spirituality. He met many false gurus and initially believed that [[hatha yoga]] was the only way to achieve the highest spiritual realization. But he realized later that people were pretending to be saints for the sake of earning money and their own selfish purposes. He migrated to Kasukkaranpalayam, a village in Perundurai taluk, [[Erode]] in [[Tamil Nadu]] after his marriage to Suleka Bivi and worked as a wholesale paddy merchant. He had a daughter named Aisuamma and he almost gave up on spirituality. But It was during this period, that he met his [[satguru]] Shri Thanigai Mani Piran (real name is Mohamed Saligh also known as Pattaiyar), who was stated to be more than 600 years old and who revealed to Salai Aandavargal about his true form. Shri Thanigai Mani Piran was also the GURU of [[Ramalinga Swamigal]]. He baptized Salai Aandavargal through Brahmopadhesam ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0baa\u0bcd\u0bb0\u0bb9\u0bcd\u0bae\u0bcb\u0baa\u0bbe\u0ba4\u0bc7\u0b9a\u0bae\u0bcd Prahm\u014dp\u0101t\u0113cam), the spiritual rebirth, at Kasukkaranpalayam, [[Erode]]. Thereafter, Salai Aandavargal followed his satguru all over South India, renouncing his profession, wife, children and everything to attain the highest spiritual enlightenment. When Aandavargal finished his travels with his guru, he was ordered to tend to a flock of sheep at Reddiyapatti village in [[Dindigul]] district for a year. This is celebrated annually as the \"([[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0b86\u0b9f\u0bc1 \u0bae\u0bc7\u0baf\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bc1 \u0ba4\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bcb\u0bb2\u0b95\u0bcd \u0b95\u0bbe\u0b9f\u0bcd\u0b9a\u0bbf \u0100\u1e6du m\u0113yppu tirukk\u014dlak k\u0101\u1e6dci)\" festival. The first meeting of Salai Andavargal and his guru is celebrated by the followers as a festival during [[Purnima|pournami day]] of the [[Panguni Uthiram|Panguni]] month (April), as the \"([[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0baa\u0bbf\u0bb1\u0bb5\u0bbe \u0ba8\u0bbe\u0bb3\u0bcd \u0baa\u0bbf\u0bb1\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bc1 \u0ba4\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0ba8\u0bbe\u0bb3\u0bcd Pi\u1e5fav\u0101 n\u0101\u1e37 pi\u1e5fappu tirun\u0101\u1e37)\" festival.\n\n=== Tapas ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\nThereafter he was directed to observe severe [[Tapas (Sanskrit)|Tapas]] in the cave on the western side of [[Thiruparankundram]] hill (near [[Madurai]]) which he carried out for many years the wakefulness and near starvation diet of Prickly pear. Thereby he acquired divine symbols (sannadams) in his sacred hand \u2013 such us [[Udukai]], [[Trishula]], [[Shankhu]], [[Sudarshana Chakra]], Villu, Vaal, [[Gada (mace)]], Angusam, Paasam, Modhagam, [[Vel]] and finally the \u201cKhill Namam\" (Crescent moon). The Crescent moon is the ultimate divine symbol, which is now used by his followers as their religion's righteous symbol. Aandavargal acquiring the holy symbol is commemorated by celebrating the festival of \u201c([[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0b95\u0bcb\u0b9f\u0bbe\u0baf\u0bc1\u0ba4 \u0b9a\u0ba9\u0bcd\u0ba9\u0ba4\u0ba4\u0bcd \u0ba4\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bbe\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bc1 \u0b95\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95\u0ba8\u0ba4\u0bcd \u0ba4\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0ba8\u0bbe\u0bb3\u0bcd Kodaayudha Sannathath Thirukkappu Kangganath Thirunall) in the month of [[Vaisakha|Vaikasi]] (June).\n\nWhen the savant understood that his disciple Salai Andavargal is fully endowed with wit and power to commence his holy mission \u201cMeivazhi\u201d(True Path), he christened him \u201cMaarganadhar\u201d and departed from him after persuading Salai Andavargal to proceed forward alone in his holy mission.\n\nCladding himself in a saffron robe, Andavargal first preached to [[Sannyasa|sanyasis]] and Saints, but thereupon he understood that most of the sanyasis were impostors not because of their ignorance but deliberation to loot innocent people's money for satisfying their lust and hunger. Finally, Andavargal gave up the garb of sanyasi and took to preaching family people engaged in worldly occupations. Later at Tiruppattur in [[Sivaganga]] district, [[Tamil Nadu]], he married Panimathi Nachiyar as per his Guru's wish.\n\n=== Religious attributes of Salai Aandavargal ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\nIt is claimed that the Heavenly Tokens which distinguish Meivazhi Salai Andavargal from the mushrooms of impostors, masquerading as master all over the world, and identify him as the only true Master of the Age, are:\n*that he has conquered slumber and sleep.\n*that his Breath never passes out of His nostrils.\n*that he has practically overcome the need for food.\n\n=== Goal of Meivazhi ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\n# Meivazhi Salai Aandavargal's mission, unparalleled in the history of the spiritual hierarchy, consists of bringing home to man the Lost truth that the very purpose of religion is to rescue him from the death-throes, eradicating the falsehoods and half-truths about religions among many other spiritual values.\n# Baptizing with the spirit, thereby enlightening and expanding the dark and constricted heart and opening the vistas of soul, a series of eternal revelations;\n# Warning against the impending disaster and destruction, the whole universe is facing.\n# Offering mankind a helping hand to escape the 'sting of death' and to win the 'victory of the grave', and\n# Resurrecting the dead even many days after their final departure from the mortal coil to reach their rendezvous (heavenly destination), which is the Abode of Bliss.\n\n==Beliefs of Meivazhi==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\nMan is an Astral being originally created by God in Heaven along with all the other Angels. But, as explained by every major religion which came upon Earth, Man was banished from Heaven after consuming a fruit created by Satan despite God's warnings, ending in a cursed state, containing both Good and Evil, within himself. Consequently, Man became unfit for living in Heaven and sent to Earth for a period of repentance. Man has been living on Earth ever since and so was Satan. God had always reminded Man that both Good and Evil exists within himself and that all he had to do to, was get in touch with his good side to reach God and Heaven. Man was given a choice to choose whichever he wanted. He could choose the Good side to reach God or otherwise, he could stay on Earth. Satan, who was more powerful than mankind and not visible to the cursed human form, was also banished to Earth and had shown no signs of repentance ever since. Satan has been corrupting mankind in whatever ways possible to prevent mankind from going back to Heaven. Most of the sufferings faced by Mankind are not because of God, but the absence of God, which emboldens Satan to wreak havoc among mankind and rule over the Earth.\n\nDuring the initial days on Earth, known as the [[Satya Yuga]], Mankind was well aware of their descent and was well-connected with God. Therefore, Satan was well under control. Satan never went anywhere close to mankind when they were in touch with God. However, when mankind forgets their origins and God, Satan gets an opportunity to corrupt them and use them for perpetuating evil deeds. The Satya Yuga came to an end and [[Treta Yuga]] started, when a portion of Mankind started to forget their origins and Satan successfully infiltrated them. Subsequently, the [[Dvapara Yuga]] saw a majority of mankind forgetting their origin and many of them were corrupted by Satan, manipulating them to believe in worldly ideas and lust after materialistic possessions, provoking them to commit heinous sins and fight amongst themselves for obtaining worldly possessions.\n\nGod had noticed these developments all along and knew that Mankind had no chance against Satan by themselves and would definitely need guidance. Therefore, God along with several other Angels had always been on Earth under various identities amongst different sectors of mankind spread across various continents, teaching them their true origin. All the different identities were shadows of the same God. All the religion in the world were started with the only purpose of making mankind realize their origins and to reach back to the one God who created them.\n\nBut despite God's efforts, Satan was also living amongst mankind during all those times, and had actively worked against the teachings of God, manipulating mankind to believe in multiple religious beliefs, multiple gods and fragmented them into different groups. Satan had managed to manipulate mankind, and create chaos amongst mankind, making them believe in multiple Gods and pitted followers of one fragment against each other. This led to utter chaos and mankind would no longer believe even the true God. Religion became a mere mockery serving no purpose. A large portion of Mankind was following religions only in name, but do not know its purpose nor they know the true God. Mankind was obsessed with materialistic possessions, totally unaware of their astral origin.\n\nTo make things worse, many Angels sent by God in the human form were tortured and even crucified by the corrupted mankind, because of disbelief and hatred under the influence of Satan. This led to the beginning of the [[Kali Yuga]], where many angels feared visiting earth due to the extent of torture meted out by mankind and most angels had returned to Heaven declaring the mankind ungrateful. The Crucification of an angel was a turning point, where God decided to put an end to Satan by destroying its world and banish it to Hell along with its followers. However, God decided to give a final opportunity to mankind before putting an end to Satan and its followers. Therefore, God, who had visiting mankind under 9 identities since the Satya Yuga, decided to visit mankind, for the final time to make them understand their true nature and their destiny. Many angels had prophesied this visit as the beginning of the Kalki Yuga, popularly explained under [[Kalki Purana]].\n\nIt is absolutely believed that Meivazhi Salai marks the beginning of this Kalki Yuga, where its founder had united almost every major religion such a Hinduism, Christianity, Islam, etc... into one community, which is no ordinary feat. Meivazhi religion preaches the oneness of all religion at its core and the true purpose of every religion on earth. Further, Meivazhi Salai strives to make mankind realize the forgotten origins and destiny of mankind to reach Heaven. Meivazhi religion constantly reminds its followers that God and evil are both within themselves and to always remember the true God at Heart, to reach Heaven. Also, its founder had instructed the followers to not worship his statues or photos, which are merely a temporary identity of god and not the god himself. Therefore, the followers of Meivazhi do not worship any statues or photos. The Meivazhi Religion teaches its followers that the only thing mankind ought to pray to God is for protecting their soul from Satan and not for any other materialistic possessions.\n\nIt is believed that the sign that a Man has reached God is that the person's physical self will become [[Incorruptibility|incorruptible]] when he dies. The soul will rest within oneself during death and hence, the person shows signs of incorruptibility. Although this may sound very strange for a majority of people, this incorruptibility very commonly occurs to the followers of the Meivazhi religion. There were instances where even non-followers, who had visited the Meivazhi Salai and prayed, acknowledging the God within themselves, have shown signs of incorruptibility. It is believed that most non-followers follow a religion, which is lost and followed only in name without even knowing that God lies within himself. People search for God in the skies, oceans, rocks and everywhere, unaware of the whereabouts of true God, and die without fulfilling their most basic purpose of finding God within their lifetime. When this happens, their soul leaves their physical selves in search of God everywhere else and will either be reborn or enslaved by Satan. Eventually, their body will decompose. But when their soul settles within themselves and reaches God, the body will never decompose, as seen in many saints.\n\n===End of the world prophecy===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\nAs stated by every other major religion on Earth, the Meivazhi religion also reiterates the end of the world prophecies and the destruction of the world during the Kalki Yuga, and it is further believed by its followers that the Kalki Yuga, the final phase of the world has already started. Its founder had mentioned that the destruction will take place on during Hijri 1,500 (between 21.07.2077 and 19.08.2077) in the Second Volume of Meivazhi Scripture, 'Maanmiyam'.\n\n== Claims of incorruptibility ==\nThe Followers of Meivazhi believe that a person's attainment of Heaven or Hell can be ascertained by their body, by observing 10 signs after death showing Immortal Proofs of Salvation at the time of death, as said to be happening in Meivazhi, showing real majestic victory over the force of death:\n* No bad stench of the body showing only pleasant aroma of the body. No discharge of foul-smelling liquid.\n* No stiffening of the body, thus showing signs of the flexibility of parts.\n* The body will be light in weight like a flower-basket.\n* The body sweats as the time passes.\n* The complete body exhibits warmness.\n* The natural conditions of the throat path. Hence the body takes in the Holy Water when given.\n* The knuckles giving out sound when cracked, all continuing in the living state.\n* The disappearance of deformities such as hunchback, with which they may have been afflicted.\n* The pure and pleasant state of the body reflecting youthfulness and cheeriness blooming on the face.\n* The body does not decay after death and also, the earth does not affect the body.\n\n== Meivazhi Scriptures ==\nMeivazhi has its own Holy scriptures running up to four volumes in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] language.\n\n* Volume I ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0b86\u0ba4\u0bbf \u0bae\u0bc6\u0baf\u0bcd \u0b89\u0ba4\u0baf \u0baa\u0bc2\u0bb0\u0ba3 \u0bb5\u0bc7\u0ba4\u0bbe\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bae\u0bcd \u0100ti mey utaya p\u016bra\u1e47a v\u0113t\u0101ntam) \n* Volume II ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0b86\u0ba3\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bb5\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bcd \u0bae\u0bbe\u0ba9\u0bcd\u0bae\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bae\u0bcd \u0100\u1e47\u1e6davarka\u1e37 m\u0101\u1e49miyam)\n* Volume III ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0b8e\u0bae\u0ba9\u0bcd \u0baa\u0b9f\u0bb0\u0bcd \u0b85\u0b9f\u0bbf\u0baa\u0b9f\u0bc1 \u0b95\u0bca\u0b9f\u0bbe\u0baf\u0bc2\u0ba4\u0b95\u0bcd \u0b95\u0bc2\u0bb0\u0bcd Ema\u1e49 pa\u1e6dar a\u1e6dipa\u1e6du ko\u1e6d\u0101y\u016btak k\u016br)\n* Volume IV ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0b8e\u0bae\u0ba9\u0bcd \u0baa\u0b9f\u0bb0\u0bcd \u0b85\u0b9f\u0bbf\u0baa\u0b9f\u0bc1 \u0ba4\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bc1 \u0bae\u0bc6\u0baf\u0bcd\u0b9e\u0bcd\u0b9e\u0bbe\u0ba9\u0b95\u0bcd \u0b95\u0bca\u0bb0\u0bb2\u0bcd Ema\u1e49 pa\u1e6dar a\u1e6dipa\u1e6du tiru mey\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e49ak koral)\n\n== Meivazhi Sabha ==\nThe first Meivazhi Ashram was founded at Rajagambeeram village in [[Sivaganga district]], [[Tamil Nadu]]. In one of the Meivazhi Vedas, namely \"Aadhi Maanmiyam\", at Chapter 2, page 7, it is stated that the Village Rajagambeeram was previously known as [[Shambhala]] during the times of [[Narada]]. The second Meivazhi Asharam was started at [[Tirupathur, Sivaganga|Tirupathur]], a panchayat town in  [[Sivaganga district]], [[Tamil Nadu]], where the Sabha was initially registered on 19 June 1933. From small beginnings, the number of followers gradually increased, year by year. By 1939, the sabha was shifted to Madurai (Aruppukottai Road). But in 1942, during the Second World War, the British Government acquired the entire place in Madurai and paid a compensation of Rs.1,37,750.00 to Meivazhi Sabha. Consequently, the sabha had to be shifted to a different place. In the same year, the sabha was shifted to a land at Pappancahivayal, [[Pudukkottai district]], [[Tamil Nadu]] where Aandavargal purchased a jungle land for about Rs.6,000.00 and cleared it for habitation. The sabha was re-registered on 10 June 1944 in the, then Pudukkottai State, where it has been functioning ever since. This place is the present [[Meivazhi Salai]]. The Control of the Sabha was under Meivazhi Salai Aandavargal till 1976, after which he entered a very deep meditative state. The place where he started meditating has become a shrine for the followers of Meivazhi and is called as the \"Ponnaranga Devalayam ([[Tamil Language|Tamil]]: \u0baa\u0bca\u0ba9\u0bcd\u0ba9\u0bb0\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95 \u0ba4\u0bc7\u0bb5\u0bbe\u0bb2\u0baf\u0bae\u0bcd, Po\u1e49\u1e49ara\u1e45ka t\u0113v\u0101layam), meaning \"The Golden Temple\". All the Prayers, Rituals and Festivals are held around this Shrine.\n\n=== Dress code for entering the Ashram ===\nMeivazhi followers have a mandatory dress code for entering the ashram. Men who have received the upadhesam, the highest level of spiritual teaching (known as Anandars), wear saffron shirts and traditional Hindu panchakacham trousers. Males who have not received it wear white turbans and clothes other than saffron, and in dark colours. Women who have received upadhesam wear sarees and cover their head with a saffron scarf, while other women cover their head with the end of the sarees.\n\n=== Practices and rituals===\nThe followers of Meivazhi do not worship any idols, tombs or any materialistic subjects, but they focus on the god within themselves whenever they pray. The rituals and festivals, which take place near the temple are merely a reminder for its followers to always focus on the god within them and to never forget the god who created them. Daily rituals take place around-the-clock at the Ponnaranga Devalayam, throughout the year. The most significant prayer ritual for the followers is the evening one, which is attended by the most people on any given day. The followers refer to the prayer rituals as 'Vanakkam ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0bb5\u0ba3\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bae\u0bcd Va\u1e47akkam)', literally meaning 'Hello' or 'Greeting' in English, possibly referring to the meeting of Human soul with the God.\n\n1.

Meivazhi Salai Aandavargal Prophecised that \"Aalayam Maara  Arasum Maarum\" meaning \"when the Shrine changes, government also changes\" was the time of Indian Independence. Then the Aalayam was moved to the present Ural hills. The sect faced a credibility crisis in March 1976, when Customs and Excise Department officers raided the hermitage in a week long operation that unearthed gold and silver ornaments from the Pudukottai campus. \u201cThe items were buried because there were no cupboards or other storage facilities in the Pudukottai ashram,\u201d says Mr. Mudaliar. \u201cThe government sued us for illegal hoarding of wealth, but eventually it lost the case.\u201d But few newspapers did false allegations for their Newspaper circulation during that time, but then the truth was revealed to everyone that the compensation given by British government was converted to gold as Advised by Andavargal, as Money can go valueless during crisis or anytime but not gold. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/the-way-of-meivazhi-salai-where-all-faiths-merge/article22437404.ece|title=The way of Meivazhi Salai, where all faiths merge|last=January 13|first=Nahla Nainar|last2=May 15|first2=2018 ISSUE DATE|website=The Hindu|language=en|access-date=2018-01-13|last3=January 13|first3=2018UPDATED|last4=Ist|first4=2018 20:50}}</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}} Nainar, Nahla (2018-01-13). \"The way of Meivazhi Salai, where all faiths merge\".

As the British war effort during [[World War One]] demanded the reallocation of resources from British India to the European war fronts, some tribesmen from Afghanistan crossed the Durand Line in 1917 to attack British posts in an attempt to gain territory and weaken the legitimacy of the border. The validity of the Durand Line, however, was re-affirmed in 1919 by the Afghan government with the signing of the [[Treaty of Rawalpindi]],<ref>Robson, ''Crisis on the Frontier'' pp. 136\u20137</ref> which ended the [[Third Anglo-Afghan War]] \u2013 a war in which Waziri tribesmen allied themselves with the forces of Afghanistan's King [[Amanullah]] in their resistance to British rule.  The Wazirs and other tribes, taking advantage of instability on the frontier, [[Waziristan campaign (1919\u201320)|continued to resist British occupation until 1920]] \u2013 even after Afghanistan had signed a peace treaty with the British.\n\nBritish campaigns to subdue tribesmen along the Durand Line, as well as three Anglo-Afghan wars, made travel between Afghanistan and the densely populated heartlands of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa increasingly difficult. The two regions were largely isolated from one another from the start of the Second Anglo-Afghan War in 1878 until the start of [[World War II]] in 1939 when conflict along the Afghan frontier largely dissipated. Concurrently, the British continued their large public works projects in the region, and extended the [[Great Indian Peninsula Railway]] into the region, which connected the modern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region to the plains of India to the east. Other projects, such as the [[Attock Bridge]], [[Islamia College University]], [[Khyber train safari|Khyber Railway]], and establishment of [[cantonments]] in [[Peshawar]], [[Kohat]], [[Mardan]], and [[Nowshera Cantonment|Nowshera]] further cemented British rule in the region.

The enraged tribesmen mustered two large lashkars 10,000 strong and battled the [[Bannu Brigade]], with heavy casualties on both sides. Widespread lawlessness erupted as tribesmen blocked roads, overran outposts and ambushed convoys. The British retaliated by sending two columns converging in the Khaisora river valley. They suppressed the agitation by imposing fines and by destroying the houses of the ringleaders, including that of Haji [[Mirzali Khan]] (Faqir of Ipi). However, the pyrrhic nature of the victory and the subsequent withdrawal of the troops was credited by the Wazirs to be a manifestation of the power of Mirzali Khan. He succeeded in inducing a semblance of tribal unity, as the British noticed with dismay, among various sections of Tori Khel Wazirs, the [[Mahsud]] and the [[Bettani]].

In trying to highlight the separateness and vulnerability of Muslims in a religiously diverse public space, the directives of the NWFP ulama began to veer away from simple religious injunctions to take on a communalist tone. The ulama highlighted 'threats' posed by Hindus to Muslims in the province. Accusations of improper behaviour and molestation of Muslim women were levelled against 'Hindu shopkeepers' in Nowshera. Sermons given by two JUS-connected maulvis in Nowshera declared the Hindus the 'enemies' of Islam and Muslims.

In 1936, a Hindu girl was abducted by a Muslim in Bannu and then married to him. The government demanded the girl's return, But popular Muslim opinion, supported by a resolution passed by the Jamiyatul Ulama Bannu, demanded that she stay, stating that she had come of her free will, had converted to Islam, and was now lawfully married and had to remain with her husband.

As the British war effort during [[World War One]] demanded the reallocation of resources from British India to the European war fronts, some tribesmen from Afghanistan crossed the Durand Line in 1917 to attack British posts in an attempt to gain territory and weaken the legitimacy of the border. The validity of the Durand Line, however, was re-affirmed in 1919 by the Afghan government with the signing of the [[Treaty of Rawalpindi]],<ref>Robson, ''Crisis on the Frontier'' pp. 136\u20137</ref> which ended the [[Third Anglo-Afghan War]] \u2013 a war in which Waziri tribesmen allied themselves with the forces of Afghanistan's King [[Amanullah]] in their resistance to British rule.  The Wazirs and other tribes, taking advantage of instability on the frontier, [[Waziristan campaign (1919\u201320)|continued to resist British occupation until 1920]] \u2013 even after Afghanistan had signed a peace treaty with the British.\n\nBritish campaigns to subdue tribesmen along the Durand Line, as well as three Anglo-Afghan wars, made travel between Afghanistan and the densely populated heartlands of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa increasingly difficult. The two regions were largely isolated from one another from the start of the Second Anglo-Afghan War in 1878 until the start of [[World War II]] in 1939 when conflict along the Afghan frontier largely dissipated. Concurrently, the British continued their large public works projects in the region, and extended the [[Great Indian Peninsula Railway]] into the region, which connected the modern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region to the plains of India to the east. Other projects, such as the [[Attock Bridge]], [[Islamia College University]], [[Khyber train safari|Khyber Railway]], and establishment of [[cantonments]] in [[Peshawar]], [[Kohat]], [[Mardan]], and [[Nowshera Cantonment|Nowshera]] further cemented British rule in the region.

British Indian court ruled against the marriage of a Hindu-converted Muslim girl at Bannu, after the girl's family filed a case of abduction and forced conversion.

The enraged tribesmen mustered two large lashkars 10,000 strong and battled the [[Bannu Brigade]], with heavy casualties on both sides. Widespread lawlessness erupted as tribesmen blocked roads, overran outposts and ambushed convoys. The British retaliated by sending two columns converging in the Khaisora river valley. They suppressed the agitation by imposing fines and by destroying the houses of the ringleaders, including that of Haji [[Mirzali Khan]] (Faqir of Ipi). However, the pyrrhic nature of the victory and the subsequent withdrawal of the troops was credited by the Wazirs to be a manifestation of the power of Mirzali Khan. He succeeded in inducing a semblance of tribal unity, as the British noticed with dismay, among various sections of Tori Khel Wazirs, the [[Mahsud]] and the [[Bettani]]. He cemented his position as a religious leader by declaring a Jihad against the British. This move also helped rally support from Pashtun tribesmen across the border.\n\nSuch controversies stirred up anti-Hindu sentiments amongst the province's Muslim population.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Haroon|first=Sana|year=2008|title=The Rise of Deobandi Islam in the North-West Frontier Province and Its Implications in Colonial India and Pakistan 1914\u20131996|jstor=27755911|journal=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society|volume=18|issue=1|pages=55|quote=The stance of the central JUH was pro-Congress, and accordingly the JUS supported the Congressite Khudai Khidmatgars through to the elections of 1937.
