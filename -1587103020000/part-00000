It is directly across the river from [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. The power station closed in 1981.\n\nPrior to redevelopment, the power station was a {{Convert|200|m|abbr=on}} long, [[steel frame]]d, brick [[Cladding (construction)|clad]] building with a substantial central chimney standing {{Convert|99|m|abbr=on}}. The structure was roughly divided into three main areas each running east\u2013west \u2013 the huge main [[Turbine Hall]] in the centre, with the [[Mechanical room|boiler house]] to the north and the switch house to the south.\n\n=== Initial redevelopment ===\nFor many years after closure Bankside Power station was at risk of being demolished by developers. Many people campaigned for the building to be saved and put forward suggestions for possible new uses. An application to [[listed building|list]] the building was refused. In April 1994 the [[Tate]] Gallery announced that Bankside would be the home for the new Tate Modern. In July of the same year, an international competition was launched to select an architect for the new gallery. Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron of [[Herzog & de Meuron]] were announced as the winning architects in January 1995. The \u00a3134&nbsp;million conversion to the Tate Modern started in June 1995 and completed in January 2000.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/local/10439829.Tate_Modern_builders_win___400m_Battersea_Power_Station_contract/|title=Tate Modern builders Carillion win \u00a3400m Battersea Power Station contract|publisher=Your local Guardian|date=23 May 2013|accessdate=27 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe most obvious external change was the two-story glass extension on one half of the roof. Much of the original internal structure remained, including the cavernous main turbine hall, which retained the overhead travelling crane. An [[electrical substation]], taking up the Switch House in the southern third of the building, remained on-site and owned by the French power company [[EDF Energy]] while Tate took over the northern Boiler House for Tate Modern's main exhibition spaces.\n\n[[File:Panoramic view from Tate Modern balcony.JPG|300px|thumb|Panoramic view from Tate Modern balcony]]\nThe history of the site as well as information about the conversion was the basis for a 2008 documentary ''Architects Herzog and de Meuron: Alchemy of Building & Tate Modern''. This challenging conversion work was carried by [[Carillion]].<ref name=\"auto\" />\n\n=== Opening and initial reception ===\nTate Modern was opened by [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]] on 11 May 2000.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/8/newsid_2519000/2519069.stm|title=2000: Sneak preview of new Tate Modern|publisher=BBC|accessdate=15 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nTate Modern received 5.25&nbsp;million visitors in its first year.

The tower was to be built over the old oil storage tanks, which would be converted to a performance art space.

Each of those floors is split into a large east and west wing with at least 11 rooms in each. Space between these wings is also used for smaller galleries on levels 2 and 4. The Boiler House shows art from 1900 to the present day.<ref name=\"map\">Tate Modern Visitor Map June 2016</ref>\n\nThe Switch House has eleven floors, numbered 0 to 10. Levels 0, 2, 3 and 4 contain gallery space. Level 0 consists of the Tanks, spaces converted from the power station's original fuel oil tanks, while all other levels are housed in the tower extension building constructed above them. The Switch House shows art from 1960 to the present day.<ref name=\"map\" />\n\nThe Turbine Hall is a single large space running the whole length of the building between the Boiler House and the Switch House. At six stories tall it represents the full height of the original power station building. It is cut by bridges between the Boiler House and the Switch House on levels 1 and 4 but the space is otherwise undivided. The western end consists of a gentle ramp down from the entrance and provides access to both sides on level 0. The eastern end provides a very large space that can be used to show exceptionally large artworks due its unusual height.\n\n== Exhibitions ==\n\n=== Collection exhibitions ===\n[[File:Tate.modern.interior.london.arp.jpg|thumb|right|A gallery at Tate Modern.]]\nThe main collection displays consist of 8 areas with a named theme or subject.

It is directly across the river from [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. The power station closed in 1981.\n\nPrior to redevelopment, the power station was a {{Convert|200|m|abbr=on}} long, [[steel frame]]d, brick [[Cladding (construction)|clad]] building with a substantial central chimney standing {{Convert|99|m|abbr=on}}. The structure was roughly divided into three main areas each running east\u2013west \u2013 the huge main [[Turbine Hall]] in the centre, with the [[Mechanical room|boiler house]] to the north and the switch house to the south.\n\n=== Initial redevelopment ===\nFor many years after closure Bankside Power station was at risk of being demolished by developers. Many people campaigned for the building to be saved and put forward suggestions for possible new uses. An application to [[listed building|list]] the building was refused. In April 1994 the [[Tate]] Gallery announced that Bankside would be the home for the new Tate Modern. In July of the same year, an international competition was launched to select an architect for the new gallery. Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron of [[Herzog & de Meuron]] were announced as the winning architects in January 1995. The \u00a3134&nbsp;million conversion to the Tate Modern started in June 1995 and completed in January 2000.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/local/10439829.Tate_Modern_builders_win___400m_Battersea_Power_Station_contract/|title=Tate Modern builders Carillion win \u00a3400m Battersea Power Station contract|publisher=Your local Guardian|date=23 May 2013|accessdate=27 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe most obvious external change was the two-story glass extension on one half of the roof. Much of the original internal structure remained, including the cavernous main turbine hall, which retained the overhead travelling crane. An [[electrical substation]], taking up the Switch House in the southern third of the building, remained on-site and owned by the French power company [[EDF Energy]] while Tate took over the northern Boiler House for Tate Modern's main exhibition spaces.\n\n[[File:Panoramic view from Tate Modern balcony.JPG|300px|thumb|Panoramic view from Tate Modern balcony]]\nThe history of the site as well as information about the conversion was the basis for a 2008 documentary ''Architects Herzog and de Meuron: Alchemy of Building & Tate Modern''. This challenging conversion work was carried by [[Carillion]].<ref name=\"auto\" />\n\n=== Opening and initial reception ===\nTate Modern was opened by [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]] on 11 May 2000.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/8/newsid_2519000/2519069.stm|title=2000: Sneak preview of new Tate Modern|publisher=BBC|accessdate=15 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nTate Modern received 5.25&nbsp;million visitors in its first year.

The Switch House shows art from 1960 to the present day.<ref name=\"map\" />\n\nThe Turbine Hall is a single large space running the whole length of the building between the Boiler House and the Switch House. At six stories tall it represents the full height of the original power station building. It is cut by bridges between the Boiler House and the Switch House on levels 1 and 4 but the space is otherwise undivided. The western end consists of a gentle ramp down from the entrance and provides access to both sides on level 0.

Tate]]'' demanding the Tate to \"disengage from [[BP]] as a sponsor, and stop allowing Tate to be used to deflect attention away from the devastating impacts that BP has around the world.\" BP is criticised for operations in relation with [[Petroleum exploration in the Arctic]], the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]], [[Oil sands]] and [[climate change]]. The artists involved in the protests are referring to a deal between BP and the Tate: BP pays \u00a3224,000 a year to the Tate. The Tate presents the brand BP in return. In June 2015 a group of artists occupied Tate Modern for 25 hours.<ref>The Guardian, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/14/tate-modern-climate-activists-bp-protest Climate activists leave Tate Modern after all-night protest against BP]</ref><ref>''[https://liberatetate.wordpress.com/liberating-tate/open-letter-to-nicholas-serota/ Liberate Tate]''</ref>\n\n== Selections from the permanent collection of paintings ==\n<gallery widths=\"180px\" heights=\"180px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Albert Gleizes, 1911, Portrait de Jacques Nayral, oil on canvas, 161.9 x 114 cm, Tate Modern, London.jpg|[[Albert Gleizes]], 1911, ''[[Portrait of Jacques Nayral (Gleizes)|Portrait de Jacques Nayral]]'', oil on canvas, 161.9 x 114&nbsp;cm.

It is a recognized academic institution, accredited by the Council for Higher Education (CHE), and as a public institution is partially financed by the Planning and Budget Committee (PBC).\n\nApproximately 3,500 students are enrolled at the college, 2,500 of whom are studying for academic degrees, and 1,000 of whom are studying in programs for professional certification, continuing studies programs, preparatory programs for completing high school matriculation certificates, and designated preparatory programs for students aiming to register for particular academic tracks.\n\n== History ==\nAchva Academic College was established in 1971 by the [[Beer Tuvia]] Regional Council, [1] as a teachers' college. In the early 1970s, the college offered study programs for technicians and practical mechanical engineers, construction and industrial management, together with study programs in teaching including two-year tracks in early childhood education and one-year programs for aides in early childhood educational settings.\n\nIn 1993, the college was approved by the CHE to offer study programs under the academic supervision of [[Ben-Gurion University]]. This was followed in 1995 by the CHE allowing Achva to award B.Ed. degrees subject to its approval in early childhood, elementary and middle school tracks, from its departments of education, literature, history, mathematics, sciences, Judaic studies, Hebrew language, and special education. In 1998, the CHE approval became full accreditation for Achva to grant these degrees at its discretion. At the same time, Arabic, English, and computers were added to the fields in which Achva was authorized to grant B.Ed. degrees.\n\nUnder the guidance of the CHE, in 1997, the college instituted a separation, administratively distinguishing the Academic College of Education from the college under the auspices and supervision of Ben-Gurion University.\n\nAn independent, non-profit association, by the name of Achva, was established in September 2000 under the academic auspices of Ben-Gurion University. Over the years, it conducted 12 general study programs for bachelor's degrees.\n\nIn 2009, Achva College under the auspices of Ben-Gurion University became recognized as an independent academic institution and was granted accreditation for awarding independent B.Sc. degrees in life sciences. As a result, two academic institutions were established on the same campus, one beside the other with separate management, presidents, executive directors, and separate employee labor committees.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nBy 2012, following a long process and the recommendation of the labor committees and the work of professional steering committees, a strategy was devised for the unification of the two colleges on the Achva campus. The CHE approved the unification that year under the name of Achva Academic College.\n\nOver the years, there were programs at the college which were transitional passageways to Ben-Gurion University for excelling students. The college severed itself from the university in 2012 as the unified structure formed one distinctive college with two undergraduate schools \u2013 one in education and one in the sciences, and an additional school of graduate studies for master's degrees.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n== The School of Sciences ==\nThe School of Sciences grants bachelor's degrees for a variety of tracks of study in the fields of life sciences, social sciences and humanities.\n\n=== Tracks of study in the School of Sciences ===\n\n\u2022\tB.A. in communication disorders\n\u2022\tB.Sc. in life sciences\n\u2022\tB.Sc. in life sciences with a specialization in agrotech and in environment and sustainability \n\u2022\tB.Sc. in management information systems\n\u2022\tB.A. in psychology\n\u2022\tB.A. in psychology, human resources track\n\u2022\tB.A. on a multidisciplinary track with evening studies and emphases on a combination of clusters of study, including: human resources, psychology, education, conflict and \n        crisis management, visual culture and art, Hebrew literature, history of ideas, history, folklore and popular culture, sociology, environment and sustainability\n\n== The School of Education ==\nThe School of Education grants bachelor's degrees in education (B.Ed.) and teaching certificates, for a variety of tracks of study and fields of specialization.\n\n=== Tracks of undergraduate study in education ===\n\n\u2022\tEarly childhood education\n\u2022\tSpecial education\n\u2022\tElementary school education\n\u2022\tMiddle school education\n\u2022\tTrack for Arabic-speaking students\n\n=== Fields of specialization on the various tracks of study ===\n\n\u2022\tMathematics\n\u2022\tEnglish\n\u2022\tNatural sciences\n\u2022\tLiterature\n\u2022\tHebrew language\n\u2022\tHistory\n\n== School of Graduate Studies ==\nThe School of Graduate Studies grants master's degrees in education, M.Ed., and in teaching, M.Teach for a variety of tracks of study.\n\n=== Tracks of study for masters' degrees ===\n\n\u2022\tM.Teach* and teaching certificate in the fields of mathematics, sciences, literature, language, or history.\n\u2022\tM.Ed. in special education\n\u2022\tM.Ed. in teaching Jewish culture\n\u2022\tM.Ed. in math education for elementary school \n\u2022\tM.Ed. in education management systems (tracks with and without theses)\n*Granting of the degree is contingent upon approval by the CHE.\n\n== Research centers in combined and integrated fields of study ==\nThere are two research centers in combined and integrated fields:\n\nThe Center for Sustainability and Agrotech \u2013 conducting research and working in the fields of pedagogy and teaching for learning about environmental sustainability, life sciences, education, ecology, etc.\n\nCenter of Neuropedagogy \u2013 established in 2016 by a team of researchers at the college, headed by Prof. Isaac Friedman.

The college was founded as a day training college with 19 students and eight members of staff, notable among whom were Messrs Kodjo Haizel and F.N. Gberbie, both of whom became principals of the college. The College was relocated at its present site at East Legon on 10 January 1985.<ref name=\":2\"/> It became a boarding institution in 2001.\n\nThe College has run the following programmes since its foundation:\n* Certificate \u2018A\u2019 4-year Post Middle\n* Certificate \u2018A\u2019 2-year Post Secondary\n* 2-year Modular Post Middle for Pupil Teachers.\n* Certificate \u2018A\u2019 3- year Post Secondary (Group One)\n* Certificate \u2018A\u2019 3-year Post Secondary (Group Two)\n* 3-year Diploma in Basic Education.\n* Untrained Teachers 4-year Diploma in Basic Education.\n\nAlthough the college remained the only day teacher training college in the country, until 2001, it performed very well both academically and professionally. It has produced many students who are eminent in several spheres of national life. Many of the past students, tutors of the college have won the best Teacher Awards. In 2007 the college won the Inter Colleges Spelling \u2018B\u2019 Competition at the zonal level.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.t-tel.org/hub|title=Learning Hub - T-TEL|website=www.t-tel.org|access-date=2019-07-25}}</ref>\n\nAccra Training College was honored by the visit of the wife of the President of the [[United States]] of America, Mrs. [[Laura Bush]] and the President of the Republic of Ghana, H.E. [[John Kufuor]] to launch a programme to produce reading materials for Basic Schools in 2006.

This investment thesis was expressed by purchasing [[credit default swap]]s against the securitizations he deemed to be most unstable, which essentially was a manner of [[shorting]] the bonds using synthetic instruments. After purchasing the positions for his flagship fund in 2006, Bass raised additional capital for a special fund dedicated exclusively to capitalizing on the opportunity that existed in the market place.
