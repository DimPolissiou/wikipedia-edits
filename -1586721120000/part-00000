A versatile player, he was often seen in central defence, although he played in most outfield positions during his career.\n\nHe started his professional career as a teenager, playing as a [[forward (association football)|striker]] for [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]]. He helped them win the [[1993\u201394 Scottish Cup]]. Towards the end of his time with United, oh Christian Dailly I'd let you shag my wife began playing as a [[Defender (association football)|central defender]]. He moved to English [[Premier League]] club [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] in 1996. After two seasons with Derby, Dailly moved to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] for a transfer fee of \u00a35,350,000. During his time with Blackburn, the club were relegated in [[1998\u201399 in English football|1999]] and oh Christian Dailly I want curly hair too lost his place in the team.\n\nHe moved to [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] in 2001 for \u00a31,700,000. During his time with West Ham, the club were relegated in [[2002\u201303 in English football|2003]] but won promotion in [[2004\u201305 in English football|2005]]. Dailly appeared as a substitute in the [[2006 FA Cup Final]], which West Ham lost on [[penalty shootout (association football)|penalties]] to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. After a loan spell with [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], Dailly moved to [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] in January 2008. He helped the team reach the [[2008 UEFA Cup Final]]. His final appearance for Rangers was as a substitute in the [[2009 Scottish Cup Final]], which Rangers won 1\u20130 against [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]]. After a two-year spell with [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] and short stints with [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] and [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]], Dailly retired in 2012.\n\nDailly made 67 full international appearances for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] between 1997 and 2008. He was part of the Scotland squad at the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]]. Dailly is also the record cap-holder for the [[Scotland national under-21 football team|Scotland under-21]] team, having made 35 appearances between 1990 and 1996.\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Dundee United===\nDailly was born in [[Dundee]] and first signed professional terms with [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] on 2 August 1990, aged sixteen years old. He became the youngest-ever player to appear for Dundee United when he made his first-team debut on 21 August 1990, though this record has since been broken by [[Greg Cameron]]. Playing as a striker and scoring in each of his first three games, Dailly quickly shot to prominence, making his [[Scotland national under-21 football team|Scotland Under 21 side]] debut just a month later. He won the [[Scottish Youth Cup]] with the club in 1990\u201391.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.scottishfa.co.uk/news/famous-faces-youth-cup-final/ | title=Famous Faces \u2013 Youth Cup Final | publisher=[[Scottish Football Association|SFA]] | date=19 May 2015 | accessdate=15 May 2019}}</ref> In his debut season, Dailly managed five goals in eighteen appearances. His debut season would become his most prolific, and the 1991\u201392 season brought just eight games with no goals. In the 1992\u201393 season, Dailly scored four from fourteen appearances and firmly established himself as a regular in the 1993\u201394 season with 38 league appearances, and not only another four goals, but also the [[Scottish Cup]], when his shot rebounded off the post for [[Craig Brewster]] to score the only goal against [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]].\n\nThe [[1994\u201395 Dundee United F.C. season|1994\u201395]] season ended in disappointment with relegation, with yet another four goals from 33 games. In [[1995\u201396 Dundee United F.C. season|1995\u201396]], Dailly was firmly established as a central defender and started the season as United's club captain, although he was subsequently replaced by [[David Bowman (footballer born 1964)|Dave Bowman]]. He scored just once in 30 appearances. It was an important goal though, as it ensured United drew the away leg of the short-lived league-playoff against [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]], and subsequently won the home leg to gain promotion at the first opportunity. This proved to be Dailly's final game for Dundee United, as he joined Derby County in August 1996 for \u00a3500,000, with a further \u00a3500,000 payable dependent on his international career, which was later paid.\n\n===Derby County===\nDailly joined Derby County at the start of the [[1996\u201397 Derby County F.C. season|1996\u201397]] season, following Derby's promotion to the [[Premier League|FA Premier League]]. In his debut English season, Dailly missed just two games, with his three goals helping Derby to 12th place and six points clear of relegation. In the [[1997\u201398 Derby County F.C. season|1997\u201398]] season, Dailly made 30 appearances and scored once; Derby fared even better, with the club finishing ninth and just two points from European football. In [[1998\u201399 Derby County F.C. season|1998\u201399]], Dailly played just once, coincidentally against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], the club to which he was then transferred.\n\n===Blackburn Rovers===\nDailly joined Rovers in August 1998 for \u00a35.35m but a [[1998\u201399 Blackburn Rovers F.C. season|tumultuous]] season followed with Dailly not finding a settled position and an injury meaning he played just seventeen times. To make matters worse, Rovers were relegated from the [[Premier League|FA Premier League]] as Dailly suffered relegation for the second time in his career. In the [[Football League First Division|First Division]], Dailly appeared 43 times in a hectic [[1999\u20132000 Blackburn Rovers F.C. season|1999\u20132000]] season, which saw him score four goals. However, he fell out of favour with new boss [[Graeme Souness]] and in January 2001, after making just nine appearances that season, Dailly left for [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] in a \u00a31.75m deal and returned to the Premier League. During his spell at Blackburn he played in a testimonial match for [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] \u2013 scoring a late consolation goal against Liverpool in the Ronnie Moran testimonial match on 13 May 2000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ronniemoran.com/testimonial.htm |title=Testimonial match versus Celtic, 13 May 2000 |publisher=Ronnie Moran |date= |accessdate=11 August 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928093657/http://www.ronniemoran.com/testimonial.htm |archive-date=28 September 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===West Ham United===\nFollowing his transfer from Blackburn to the Hammers for a fee of \u00a31.7m he made twelve appearances in [[2000\u201301 West Ham United F.C. season|2000\u201301]], helping the Hammers to 15th place. He also played in their 1\u20130 victory over Manchester United at [[Old Trafford]] in the FA Cup.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/1140138.stm\n|title=Di Canio sinks Man Utd\n|publisher=BBC Sport\n|date=28 January 2001\n|accessdate=14 August 2009}}</ref> The following season, Dailly played every minute of every game as West Ham finished in seventh place. [[2002\u201303 West Ham United F.C. season|2002\u201303]] proved to be a low point, as Daily suffered relegation for a third time. Playing 26 times, West Ham were relegated with the highest number of points since the 1995\u201396 change to 20 teams, a total of 42.\n\nDailly was to go on and score twice from 43 games as West Ham finished in the Division One play-off positions in [[2003\u201304 West Ham United F.C. season|2003\u201304]]. He scored the winner against [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] in the play-off semi-final to send them to the final<ref name=\"posemi\">{{cite web |accessdate=2012-01-11|publisher=www.sportinglife.com| url=http://www.sportinglife.com/football/cc_championship/westham/reports/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=soccer/04/05/18/SOCCER_West_Ham.html&TEAMHD=westham&DIV=nat1&TEAM=WEST--HAM&RH=West--Ham&PREV_SEASON=2002 | title=West Ham 2 Ipswich 0 (Agg: 2\u20131)}}</ref> but they failed to win promotion.

A versatile player, he was often seen in central defence, although he played in most outfield positions during his career.\n\nHe started his professional career as a teenager, playing as a [[forward (association football)|striker]] for [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]]. He helped them win the [[1993\u201394 Scottish Cup]]. Towards the end of his time with United, Dailly began playing as a [[Defender (association football)|central defender]]. He moved to English [[Premier League]] club [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] in 1996. After two seasons with Derby, Dailly moved to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] for a transfer fee of \u00a35,350,000. During his time with Blackburn, the club were relegated in [[1998\u201399 in English football|1999]] and Dailly lost his place in the team.\n\nHe moved to [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] in 2001 for \u00a31,700,000. During his time with West Ham, the club were relegated in [[2002\u201303 in English football|2003]] but won promotion in [[2004\u201305 in English football|2005]]. Dailly appeared as a substitute in the [[2006 FA Cup Final]], which West Ham lost on [[penalty shootout (association football)|penalties]] to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. After a loan spell with [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], Dailly moved to [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] in January 2008. He helped the team reach the [[2008 UEFA Cup Final]]. His final appearance for Rangers was as a substitute in the [[2009 Scottish Cup Final]], which Rangers won 1\u20130 against [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]]. After a two-year spell with [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] and short stints with [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] and [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]], Dailly retired in 2012.\n\nDailly made 67 full international appearances for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] between 1997 and 2008. He was part of the Scotland squad at the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]]. Dailly is also the record cap-holder for the [[Scotland national under-21 football team|Scotland under-21]] team, having made 35 appearances between 1990 and 1996.\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Dundee United===\nDailly was born in [[Dundee]] and first signed professional terms with [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] on 2 August 1990, aged sixteen years old. He became the youngest-ever player to appear for Dundee United when he made his first-team debut on 21 August 1990, though this record has since been broken by [[Greg Cameron]]. Playing as a striker and scoring in each of his first three games, Dailly quickly shot to prominence, making his [[Scotland national under-21 football team|Scotland Under 21 side]] debut just a month later. He won the [[Scottish Youth Cup]] with the club in 1990\u201391.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.scottishfa.co.uk/news/famous-faces-youth-cup-final/ | title=Famous Faces \u2013 Youth Cup Final | publisher=[[Scottish Football Association|SFA]] | date=19 May 2015 | accessdate=15 May 2019}}</ref> In his debut season, Dailly managed five goals in eighteen appearances. His debut season would become his most prolific, and the 1991\u201392 season brought just eight games with no goals. In the 1992\u201393 season, Dailly scored four from fourteen appearances and firmly established himself as a regular in the 1993\u201394 season with 38 league appearances, and not only another four goals, but also the [[Scottish Cup]], when his shot rebounded off the post for [[Craig Brewster]] to score the only goal against [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]].\n\nThe [[1994\u201395 Dundee United F.C. season|1994\u201395]] season ended in disappointment with relegation, with yet another four goals from 33 games. In [[1995\u201396 Dundee United F.C. season|1995\u201396]], Dailly was firmly established as a central defender and started the season as United's club captain, although he was subsequently replaced by [[David Bowman (footballer born 1964)|Dave Bowman]]. He scored just once in 30 appearances. It was an important goal though, as it ensured United drew the away leg of the short-lived league-playoff against [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]], and subsequently won the home leg to gain promotion at the first opportunity. This proved to be Dailly's final game for Dundee United, as he joined Derby County in August 1996 for \u00a3500,000, with a further \u00a3500,000 payable dependent on his international career, which was later paid.\n\n===Derby County===\nDailly joined Derby County at the start of the [[1996\u201397 Derby County F.C. season|1996\u201397]] season, following Derby's promotion to the [[Premier League|FA Premier League]]. In his debut English season, Dailly missed just two games, with his three goals helping Derby to 12th place and six points clear of relegation. In the [[1997\u201398 Derby County F.C. season|1997\u201398]] season, Dailly made 30 appearances and scored once; Derby fared even better, with the club finishing ninth and just two points from European football. In [[1998\u201399 Derby County F.C. season|1998\u201399]], Dailly played just once, coincidentally against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], the club to which he was then transferred.\n\n===Blackburn Rovers===\nDailly joined Rovers in August 1998 for \u00a35.35m but a [[1998\u201399 Blackburn Rovers F.C. season|tumultuous]] season followed with Dailly not finding a settled position and an injury meaning he played just seventeen times. To make matters worse, Rovers were relegated from the [[Premier League|FA Premier League]] as Dailly suffered relegation for the second time in his career. In the [[Football League First Division|First Division]], Dailly appeared 43 times in a hectic [[1999\u20132000 Blackburn Rovers F.C. season|1999\u20132000]] season, which saw him score four goals. However, he fell out of favour with new boss [[Graeme Souness]] and in January 2001, after making just nine appearances that season, Dailly left for [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] in a \u00a31.75m deal and returned to the Premier League. During his spell at Blackburn he played in a testimonial match for [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] \u2013 scoring a late consolation goal against Liverpool in the Ronnie Moran testimonial match on 13 May 2000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ronniemoran.com/testimonial.htm |title=Testimonial match versus Celtic, 13 May 2000 |publisher=Ronnie Moran |date= |accessdate=11 August 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928093657/http://www.ronniemoran.com/testimonial.htm |archive-date=28 September 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===West Ham United===\nFollowing his transfer from Blackburn to the Hammers for a fee of \u00a31.7m he made twelve appearances in [[2000\u201301 West Ham United F.C. season|2000\u201301]], helping the Hammers to 15th place. He also played in their 1\u20130 victory over Manchester United at [[Old Trafford]] in the FA Cup.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/1140138.stm\n|title=Di Canio sinks Man Utd\n|publisher=BBC Sport\n|date=28 January 2001\n|accessdate=14 August 2009}}</ref> The following season, Dailly played every minute of every game as West Ham finished in seventh place. [[2002\u201303 West Ham United F.C. season|2002\u201303]] proved to be a low point, as Daily suffered relegation for a third time. Playing 26 times, West Ham were relegated with the highest number of points since the 1995\u201396 change to 20 teams, a total of 42.\n\nDailly was to go on and score twice from 43 games as West Ham finished in the Division One play-off positions in [[2003\u201304 West Ham United F.C. season|2003\u201304]]. He scored the winner against [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] in the play-off semi-final to send them to the final<ref name=\"posemi\">{{cite web |accessdate=2012-01-11|publisher=www.sportinglife.com| url=http://www.sportinglife.com/football/cc_championship/westham/reports/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=soccer/04/05/18/SOCCER_West_Ham.html&TEAMHD=westham&DIV=nat1&TEAM=WEST--HAM&RH=West--Ham&PREV_SEASON=2002 | title=West Ham 2 Ipswich 0 (Agg: 2\u20131)}}</ref> but they failed to win promotion.

His first goal came in just his second match, and just four days after his international debut, when his early goal helped Scotland to a 3\u20132 away victory over [[Malta national football team|Malta]] in a friendly match.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nDailly had a long Scotland career, winning 67 caps and scoring 6 goals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/scottish_football_players.cfm?page=138|title=International Roll of Honour|publisher=Scottish Football Association|accessdate=17 June 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011104402/http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/scottish_football_players.cfm?page=138|archivedate=11 October 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> He captained Scotland a total of 12 times and was selected for the Scotland squad at the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]].
