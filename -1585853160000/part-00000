The First Arab-Khazar War began during the first phase of [[Muslim conquests|Muslim expansion]]. By 640, Muslim forces had reached Armenia; in 642 they launched their first raid across the Caucasus under [[Abd ar-Rahman ibn Rabiah]]. In 652 Arab forces advanced on the Khazar capital, [[Balanjar]], but were [[Battle of Balanjar (650s)|defeated]], suffering heavy losses; according to Persian historians such as [[Abu Jafar Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]], both sides in the battle used [[catapult]]s against the opposing troops. A number of Russian sources give the name of a Khazar khagan from this period as [[List of Khazar rulers|Irbis]] and describe him as a scion of the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk royal house, the Ashina. Whether Irbis ever existed is open to debate, as is whether he can be identified with one of the many G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk rulers of the same name.\n\nDue to the outbreak of the [[First Fitna|First Muslim Civil War]] and other priorities, the Arabs refrained from repeating an attack on the Khazars until the early 8th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Mako|2010|p=45}}</ref> The Khazars launched a few raids into Transcaucasian principalities under Muslim dominion, including a large-scale raid in 683\u2013685 during the [[Second Fitna|Second Muslim Civil War]] that rendered much booty and many prisoners.<ref name=\"Brook 2010 126\u20137\">{{harvnb|Brook|2010|pp=126\u2013127}}</ref> There is evidence from the account of al-Tabari that the Khazars formed a united front with the remnants of the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks in Transoxiana.\n\n[[File:Map of the Caucasus, 740 CE.svg|thumb|300px|{{center|Caucasus region, c. 740}}]]\n\nThe Second Arab-Khazar War began with a series of raids across the Caucasus in the early 8th century. The Umayyads tightened their grip on Armenia in 705 after suppressing a large-scale rebellion. In 713 or 714, Umayyad general [[Maslamah ibn Abd al-Malik|Maslamah]] conquered Derbent and drove deeper into Khazar territory. The Khazars launched raids in response into [[Caucasian Albania|Albania]] and [[Iranian Azerbaijan]] but were driven back by the Arabs under [[Hasan ibn al-Nu'man]].<ref>{{harvnb|Brook|2010|p=127}}</ref> The conflict escalated in 722 with an invasion by 30,000 Khazars into Armenia inflicting a crushing defeat. Caliph [[Yazid II]] responded, sending 25,000 Arab troops north, swiftly driving the Khazars back across the Caucasus, recovering Derbent, and advancing on Balanjar. The Arabs [[Battle of Balanjar (723)|broke through the Khazar defence]] and stormed the city; most of its inhabitants were killed or enslaved, but a few managed to flee north.<ref name=\"Brook 2010 126\u20137\"/> Despite their success, the Arabs had not yet defeated the Khazar army, and they retreated south of the Caucasus.\n\nIn 724, Arab general [[al-Jarrah ibn Abdallah al-Hakami]] inflicted a crushing defeat on the Khazars in a long battle between the rivers [[Cyrus (river)|Cyrus]] and [[Araxes]], then moved on to capture [[Tiflis]], bringing [[Caucasian Iberia]] under Muslim suzerainty. The Khazars struck back in 726, led by a prince named [[Barjik]], launching a major invasion of Albania and Azerbaijan; by 729, the Arabs had lost control of northeastern Transcaucasia and were thrust again into the defensive. In 730, Barjik invaded Iranian Azerbaijan and [[Battle of Ardabil|defeated]] Arab forces at [[Ardabil]], killing the general [[al-Djarrah al-Hakami]] and briefly occupying the town. Barjik was defeated and killed the next year at [[Mosul]], where he directed Khazar forces from a throne mounted with al-Djarrah's severed head {{citation needed|date=November 2016}}. In 737, Marwan Ibn Muhammad entered Khazar territory under the guise of seeking a truce. He then launched a surprise attack in which The Qaghan fled north and the Khazars surrendered.<ref name=\"Khazar Studies\">{{cite book|last1=Golden|first1=Peter B.|title=Khazar Studies|date=1980|page=64}}</ref> The Arabs did not have resources to influence affairs of Transcaucasia.<ref name=\"Khazar Studies\"/> The Qa\u011fan was forced to accept terms involving conversion to Islam, and to subject himself to the Caliphate, but the accommodation was short-lived as a combination of internal instability among the Umayyads and Byzantine support undid the agreement within three years, and the Khazars re-asserted their independence.<ref>{{harvnb|Wasserstein|2007|pp=375\u2013376}}</ref> The suggestion that the Khazars adopted [[Judaism]] as early as 740 is based on the idea that, in part, it was, a re-assertion of independence with regard to both Byzantium and the Caliphate, while conforming to a general Eurasian trend to embrace a world religion.<ref>{{harvnb|Beckwith|2009|p=149}}:'The Khazars, the close allies of the Byzantines, adopted Judaism, as their official religion, apparently by 740, three years after an invasion by the Arabs under Marwan ibn Muhammad. Marwan had used treachery against a Khazar envoy to gain peaceful entrance to Khazar territory. He then declared his dishonourable intentions and pressed deep into Khazar territory, only subsequently releasing the envoy. The Arabs devastated the horse herds, seized many Khazars and others as captives, and forced much of the population to flee into the Ural Mountains. Marwan\u2019s terms were that the kaghan and his Khazars should convert to Islam. Having no choice, the kaghan agreed, and the Arabs returned home in triumph. As soon as the Arabs were gone, the kaghan renounced Islam \u2013 with, one may assume, great vehemence. The Khazar Dynasty\u2019s conversion to Judaism is best explained by this specific historical background, together with the fact that the mid-eighth century was an age in  which the major Eurasian states proclaimed their adherence to distinctive world religions. Adopting Judaism also was politically astute: it meant the Khazars avoided having to accept the overlordship (jhowever theoretical) of the Arab caliph or the Byzantine emperor.'</ref>\n\nWhatever the impact of Marwan's campaigns, warfare between the Khazars and the Arabs ceased for more than two decades after 737. Arab raids continued until 741, but their control in the region was limited as maintaining a large garrison at Derbent further depleted the already overstretched army. A [[Third Fitna|third Muslim civil war]] soon broke out, leading to the Abbasid Revolution and the fall of the Umayyad dynasty in 750.\n\nIn 758, the [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] [[al-Mansur]] attempted to strengthen diplomatic ties with the Khazars, ordering [[Yazid ibn Usayd al-Sulami]], one of his nobles and the [[Ostikanate of Arminiya|military governor of Armenia]], to take a royal Khazar bride. Yazid married a daughter of Khazar Khagan [[Baghatur]], but she died inexplicably, possibly in childbirth. Her attendants returned home, convinced that some Arab faction had poisoned her, and her father was enraged. Khazar general [[Ras Tarkhan]] invaded south of the Caucasus in 762\u2013764, devastating Albania, Armenia, and Iberia, and capturing Tiflis. Thereafter relations became increasingly cordial between the Khazars and the Abbasids, whose foreign policies were generally less expansionist than the Umayyads, broken only by a series of raids in 799 over another failed marriage alliance.\n\n===Rise of the Rus' and the collapse of the Khazarian state===\n[[File:Varangian routes.png|thumb|300px|Trade routes of the Black Sea region, 8th\u201311th centuries]]\n\nBy the 9th century, groups of [[Varangians|Varangian Rus']], developing a powerful warrior-merchant system, began probing south down the waterways controlled by the Khazars and their protectorate, the [[Volga Bulgaria]]ns, partially in pursuit of the Arab silver that flowed north for hoarding through the Khazarian-Volga Bulgarian trading zones,<ref>{{harvnb|Moss|2002|p=16}}.

Something of its nature may be deduced from what we know of the rites and beliefs of contiguous tribes, such as the North Caucasian Huns. [[Horse sacrifice]]s were made to this supreme deity. Rites involved offerings to fire, water, and the moon, to remarkable creatures, and to \"gods of the road\" (cf. Old T\u00fcrk ''yol tengri'', perhaps a god of fortune). Sun amulets were widespread as cultic ornaments. A tree cult was also maintained. Whatever was struck by lightning, man or object, was considered a sacrifice to the high god of heaven. The afterlife, to judge from excavations of aristocratic tumuli, was much a continuation of life on earth, warriors being interred with their weapons, horses, and sometimes with human sacrifices: the funeral of one ''tudrun'' in 711-12 saw 300 soldiers killed to accompany him to the otherworld. [[Ancestor worship]] was observed. The key religious figure appears to have been a [[shamanism|shaman]]-like ''qam'',<ref>{{harvnb|Golden|2007|pp=131\u2013133}}</ref> and it was these (''qozm\u00edm'') that were, according to the Khazar Hebrew conversion stories, driven out.\n\nMany sources suggest, and a notable number of scholars have argued, that the charismatic \u0100sh\u01d0n\u00e0 clan played a germinal role in the early Khazar state, although Zuckerman dismisses the widespread notion of their pivotal role as a 'phantom'. The \u0100sh\u01d0n\u00e0 were closely associated with the [[Tengrism|Tengri cult]], whose practices involved rites performed to assure a tribe of heaven's protective providence.<ref>{{harvnb|Whittow |1996|p=220}}</ref> The qa\u011fan was deemed to rule by virtue of ''qut'', \"the heavenly mandate/good fortune to rule.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Golden|2007b|p=133}}. {{harvnb|Whittow|1996|p=220}} notes that this native institution, given the constant, lengthy, military and acculturating pressures on the tribes from China to the East, was influenced also by the [[Sinocentrism|sinocentric]] doctrine of the [[Mandate of Heaven|Mandate of Heaven (Ti\u0101nm\u00ecng:(\u5929\u547d)]], which signaled legitimacy of rule.</ref>\n\n===Christianity===\nKhazaria long served as a [[buffer state]] between the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine empire]] and both the nomads of the northern steppes and the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad empire]], after serving as Byzantium's proxy against the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian Persian empire]].

By 640, Muslim forces had reached Armenia; in 642 they launched their first raid across the Caucasus under [[Abd ar-Rahman ibn Rabiah]]. In 652 Arab forces advanced on the Khazar capital, [[Balanjar]], but were [[Battle of Balanjar (650s)|defeated]], suffering heavy losses; according to Persian historians such as [[Abu Jafar Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]], both sides in the battle used [[catapult]]s against the opposing troops.

The Arabs [[Battle of Balanjar (723)|broke through the Khazar defence]] and stormed the city; most of its inhabitants were killed or enslaved, but a few managed to flee north.<ref name=\"Brook 2010 126\u20137\"/> Despite their success, the Arabs had not yet defeated the Khazar army, and they retreated south of the Caucasus.\n\nIn 724, Arab general [[al-Jarrah ibn Abdallah al-Hakami]] inflicted a crushing defeat on the Khazars in a long battle between the rivers [[Cyrus (river)|Cyrus]] and [[Araxes]], then moved on to capture [[Tiflis]], bringing [[Caucasian Iberia]] under Muslim suzerainty. The Khazars struck back in 726, led by a prince named [[Barjik]], launching a major invasion of Albania and Azerbaijan; by 729, the Arabs had lost control of northeastern Transcaucasia and were thrust again into the defensive.

Marwan had used treachery against a Khazar envoy to gain peaceful entrance to Khazar territory. He then declared his dishonourable intentions and pressed deep into Khazar territory, only subsequently releasing the envoy. The Arabs devastated the horse herds, seized many Khazars and others as captives, and forced much of the population to flee into the Ural Mountains. Marwan\u2019s terms were that the kaghan and his Khazars should convert to Islam. Having no choice, the kaghan agreed, and the Arabs returned home in triumph. As soon as the Arabs were gone, the kaghan renounced Islam \u2013 with, one may assume, great vehemence. The Khazar Dynasty\u2019s conversion to Judaism is best explained by this specific historical background, together with the fact that the mid-eighth century was an age in  which the major Eurasian states proclaimed their adherence to distinctive world religions. Adopting Judaism also was politically astute: it meant the Khazars avoided having to accept the overlordship (jhowever theoretical) of the Arab caliph or the Byzantine emperor.'</ref>\n\nWhatever the impact of Marwan's campaigns, warfare between the Khazars and the Arabs ceased for more than two decades after 737. Arab raids continued until 741, but their control in the region was limited as maintaining a large garrison at Derbent further depleted the already overstretched army.

Khazar general [[Ras Tarkhan]] invaded south of the Caucasus in 762\u2013764, devastating Albania, Armenia, and Iberia, and capturing Tiflis. Thereafter relations became increasingly cordial between the Khazars and the Abbasids, whose foreign policies were generally less expansionist than the Umayyads, broken only by a series of raids in 799 over another failed marriage alliance.\n\n===Rise of the Rus' and the collapse of the Khazarian state===\n[[File:Varangian routes.png|thumb|300px|Trade routes of the Black Sea region, 8th\u201311th centuries]]\n\nBy the 9th century, groups of [[Varangians|Varangian Rus']], developing a powerful warrior-merchant system, began probing south down the waterways controlled by the Khazars and their protectorate, the [[Volga Bulgaria]]ns, partially in pursuit of the Arab silver that flowed north for hoarding through the Khazarian-Volga Bulgarian trading zones,<ref>{{harvnb|Moss|2002|p=16}}.

Something of its nature may be deduced from what we know of the rites and beliefs of contiguous tribes, such as the North Caucasian Huns. [[Horse sacrifice]]s were made to this supreme deity. Rites involved offerings to fire, water, and the moon, to remarkable creatures, and to \"gods of the road\" (cf. Old T\u00fcrk ''yol tengri'', perhaps a god of fortune). Sun amulets were widespread as cultic ornaments. A tree cult was also maintained. Whatever was struck by lightning, man or object, was considered a sacrifice to the high god of heaven. The afterlife, to judge from excavations of aristocratic tumuli, was much a continuation of life on earth, warriors being interred with their weapons, horses, and sometimes with human sacrifices: the funeral of one ''tudrun'' in 711-12 saw 300 soldiers killed to accompany him to the otherworld.

She says:\n{{quote|\"We kept them both going side by side. There are two sides to the work; the shiny side and the dark side. That kind of reflects the two personalities within us.\"<ref name=\"Zenth\">Zenth, Torben [http://www.kopenhagen.dk/interviews/interviews/interviews_2007/interview_tim_noble_sue_webster/ \"Interview: Tim Noble and Sue Webster\"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20110719125022/http://www.kopenhagen.dk/interviews/interviews/interviews_2007/interview_tim_noble_sue_webster/ |date=19 July 2011 }} 21 March 2007</ref>}}\n\nThe influence of music on their art, particularly [[punk rock]], has been of great importance to them since they began their earliest collaborations: Says Noble:\n{{quote|\"I think anything that's a bit of a rocket up the arse, anything that kicks against the routine, against the mundane things that close down your mind, is a refreshing and good thing. Punk did that very successfully&nbsp;... it offered a direct and instant means of producing products or things.\"<ref name=\"Calder\">Calder, Diane, [https://web.archive.org/web/20011217133859/http://artscenecal.com/ArticlesFile/Archive/Articles2001/Articles1201/TNobleA.html \"Review of Gagosian Show\"] 2001</ref>}}\n\nAdds Webster:\n{{quote|\"When we make a piece of work we're constantly looking for something that will take our breath away because if it does that to us we've pushed it as far as it will go. We like to look at every different way of making it, it can be very simple or very complicated, but we don't feel satisfied until we've both given it a good going over.\"<ref>Gaskin, Vivienne [http://bak.spc.org/everything/e/hard/texts2/1suetim.html] ''Everything'', 1997</ref>}}\n\nSir [[Norman Rosenthal]], the former Exhibitions Secretary of the Royal Academy, writes:\n{{quote|\"At the most immediate and most important level, [Tim] Noble and [Sue] Webster's work symbolizes a pair of artists clearly besotted and totally in love with each other, artists who are only interested in picturing themselves: sometimes surrounded by detritus; other times by pastiches of contemporary neon advertising. An antiaesthetic of vulgarity rules on the surface of their work.\"<ref name=\"Rosenthal\">Rosenthal, Norman \"The Magic Arts of Noble & Webster&nbsp;\u2013 Tim and Sue\" in ''Wasted Youth'' New York: Rizzoli International Publications, US, 2009</ref>}}\n\n===Shadow sculptures===\nThe Shadow Sculptures incorporate diverse materials including household rubbish, scrap metal and taxidermy animals. By shining light onto these assemblages they are transformed into highly accurate shadow profiles of the artists.<ref>[http://www.blainsouthern.com/artists/tim-noble-and-sue-webster] Blain|Southern website</ref><ref>[http://www.gagosian.com/artists/tim-noble-and-sue-webster/] Gagosian gallery website</ref>\n\n[[File:Miss Understood and Mr Meanor, 1997.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Miss Understood & Mr Meanor, 1997]]Discussing their shadow works, Webster commented: \"''Our work is incredibly unsocial. There has to be complete darkness because you need to give the light and then to take it away again.''\"<ref>[http://www.theartnewspaper.com] Louisa Buck \"Alchemists?\", ''The Art Newspaper'', 1 October 2000</ref>\n\nTheir first shadow sculpture, 'Miss Understood and Mr Meanor', 1997 (''right''), came into existence through experimentation with the assemblage of personal items and domestic trash.<ref name=\"Deitch\"/> The silhouettes are formed by lights shining on mounds of rubbish, which includes broken sunglasses and pin badges for rock bands. In this particular work the artist's heads are severed and impaled on stakes.<ref name=\"Deitch\"/> The work was destroyed in the 2004 [[Momart]] warehouse fire, along with a number of other well-known works from the Saatchi Collection.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_pictures/3751125.stm] BBC Online 26 May 2004</ref><ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/may/27/thebritartfire.arts1] The Guardian 27 May 2004</ref>\n\nThrough their shadow sculptures they managed to fuse the abstract and the representational, a pursuit that consumed the likes of [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Willem de Kooning]] and [[Francis Bacon]].<ref name=\"Deitch\"/> This became even more apparent with their second major shadow sculpture, 'Dirty White Trash (with Gulls)', 1998 (''left''), which expanded the innovations of 'Miss Understood and Mr Meanor'.<ref name=\"MoMA\">[http://ps1.org/exhibitions/view/60] MoMA PS1</ref> This work is composed of a new kind of self-portrait, sculpted out of six months' worth of the artists' rubbish; the remains of everything they needed to survive during the time it took to make the work. A single light source illuminates the pile of rubbish thus casting a portrait in shadow, which contrasts sharply with the materials used to create it; the artists leaning against each other, back to back, enjoying a glass of wine and a cigarette.<ref name=\"MoMA\"/>\n\nJeffrey Deitch, the director of the [[Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art]], writes:\n{{quote|\"''Dirty White Trash (with Gulls)'' is a confluence of beauty and filth, form and anti-form. It is a work of art made out of the process of its own conception, an embodiment of formalist logic. At the same time, it is a negation of everything that formalism stands for&nbsp;... The artist is at the center of the work. It is deliberately entertaining, and revels in its own theatricality.\"<ref name=\"Deitch\"/>}}\n\nAnother work, 'British Wildlife' was created after Noble's father died in 2000. Using his collection of taxidermy animals, it is an assemblage of forty-six birds, forty mammals, and two stuffed fish, including a whole swan and even the pet crow Noble kept as a child.<ref name=\"Deitch\"/> The shadow formed by this mass of animals fittingly depicts back to back busts of the artists in a pose of grief.<ref>[http://allvisualarts.org/Exhibitions/VanitasTheTransienceofEarthlyPleasures.aspx All Visual Arts website]</ref>\n\nIn September 2000, they were invited to participate in 'Apocalypse', the [[Royal Academy]]'s follow up to the infamous [[Sensation exhibition]] of 1997. For this they presented 'The Undesirables', which comprises a mountain of detritus collected from outside Tim and Sue's house with a shadow image of the artists hovering above.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/may/03/fiachragibbons] Sensation's over, now it's Apocalypse. Guardian, May 2000</ref> The appearance of a huge pile of rubbish in one of the largest galleries within the Royal Academy was intentionally radical and shocking, created to challenge viewers' assumptions about art.<ref>Louisa Buck \"Alchemists?\", ''The Art Newspaper'', 1 October 2000</ref>\n\nIn 2006, an exhibition of their work was held at the [[Freud Museum]], entitled 'Polymorphous Perverse'.<ref>Januszczak, Waldemar [http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/article663518.ece \"Grotto Fabulous\"] The Sunday Times, 17 December 2006</ref>'Black Narcissus', a sculpture made of black silicone casts of Webster's fingers and Noble's penis in various states of arousal, was placed in [[Sigmund Freud]]'s study next to a bust of Freud himself. When illuminated the sculpture cast a double profile portrait of the artists, illustrating how sexuality influences our perception of reality reflecting the sexuality that Freud discovered at the core of human life. Another work, 'Scarlett', 2006 (see below video on 'External link') was a \"''worktable on which numerous bizarre mechanical toys are working and seemingly in the process of being made; a nightmarish setting of repressed sexual and sadomasochistic fantasies and transgressions.''\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.freud.org.uk/exhibitions/10512/polymorphous-perverse/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107114859/http://www.freud.org.uk/exhibitions/10512/polymorphous-perverse/ |archivedate=7 January 2011 |df=dmy-all }} The Freud Museum website</ref>\n\n===Light sculptures===\nThe light sculptures, created in tandem with their shadow investigations, are constructed out of computer sequenced light-bulbs that perpetually flash, sending out messages of, often simultaneous, love and hate. The sculptures reference the iconic [[pop culture]] symbols of Britain and America, recalling carnival shows and signage typical of working-class sea-side Britain, [[Piccadilly Circus]], [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] and [[Times Square]].<ref name=\"Deitch\"/>\n\n[[File:Puny Undernourished Kid, 2004.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Puny Undernourished Kid & Girlfriend From Hell, (Diptych) 2004]]\n\nAs with almost all of their work, many of the Light Sculptures are meant to be contradictory, and to produce conflicting feelings in the viewer. This is certainly the case with their early light sculpture, 'Toxic Schizophrenia', 1997. The relentlessly flashing heart with a knife stuck through it fuses a Christian emblem with a clich\u00e9 rock 'n' roll tattoo. As with the shadow sculptures, duality lies at its core; the work represents romance and pain, love and hate, friendship and alienation, negative and positive.<ref name=\"Rosenthal\"/>\n\nThe same contradictions resonate at the centre of their later work, 'Sacrificial Heart', 2008, a three-dimensional rotating version of 'Toxic Schizophrenia', which, like the earlier work, is both repellent and strangely alluring.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/reviews/tim-noble-and-sue-webster-gagosian-gallery-london-768435.html Darwent, Charles, Review of Gagosian show, London] ''The Independent'', 6 January 2008</ref><ref>[http://www.gagosian.com/exhibitions/2007-12-12_tim-noble-and-sue-webster/] Gagosian Gallery website</ref>'Toxic Schizophrenia (Hyper Version)' was their first permanent public sculpture, unveiled at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Denver, May 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mcadenver.org/index.php/about/noble_webster |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229215724/http://mcadenver.org/index.php/about/noble_webster |archivedate=29 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }} MCA Denver website</ref>\n\nContradictions and irony abound in the works exhibited at the [[Gagosian]], Beverley Hills exhibition, 'Instant Gratification', 2001.<ref name=\"Calder\"/> The twenty foot long revision of their original 1997 'Forever' is inextricably linked to the artist's earlier trips to Las Vegas, playing with the traditional connotations of the word, as the constantly flashing lights reinforce the idea of 'forever'.<ref name=\"Deitch\"/>\n\nWith 'A Pair of Dollars' they attempted to form an ironic response to the art market and art fairs, creating what Noble described as a 'vulgar' artwork, to demonstrate their annoyance with this system.<ref name=\"Zenth\"/> However, he has since acknowledged the failure of this irony, due to the huge success of the piece.<ref name=\"Zenth\"/>\n\n'Puny Undernourished Kid & Girlfriend from Hell' (''Puny Undernourished Kid shown left''), represents another return to earlier work, as it derives from cartoon-like drawings that Noble and Webster had made of each other ten years before.<ref name=\"Deitch\"/> These large neon figures are covered with neon tattoos of aggressive and forceful statements, clearly demonstrating the influence of punk rock on the artists.<ref name=\"Holzwarth\" />\n\n===Metal sculptures===\n'The Crack' (2004), is one in a series of welded metal sculptures which appear at first glance as abstract works in the tradition of [[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]] and Anthony Caro, while they actually work to reverse this abstraction into figuration.<ref name=\"Deitch\"/>\n\n'The Crack', a vertical column-like form, is possibly the most difficult of the artists' shadow works to decipher. Instead of focusing on the usual black silhouettes cast on the wall, the viewer must instead focus on the white space around the shadow, which reveals the naked bodies of the artists facing each other. This perceptual challenge brings to mind [[Ernst Gombrich]]'s discussion of perception in his famous 1960 book, 'Art and Illusion'.<ref>Gombrich, Ernst ''Art and Illusion: A Study in the Psychology of Pictorial Representation'' New York, 1960</ref> 'The Crack' displays at one moment an abstract shape that is perhaps reminiscent of a heroic mountain landscape by [[Clyfford Still]], with its cracks and gullies; gradually we begin to perceive the full-length naked profiles of our friends approaching each other, nipples touching, as though they are about to make love again for the millionth time.''<ref name=\"Rosenthal\"/>\n\n===The New Barbarians===\n[[File:The New Barbarians Tim Noble and Sue Webster.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The New Barbarians, 1997-9]]In 1997, Tim Noble and Sue Webster commissioned a sculptor from [[Madame Tussauds]] to help them create a life-size sculpture of themselves as [[australopithecines]]. Called 'The New Barbarians' (''left''), the work is based upon a diorama at the [[American Museum of Natural History]], New York, which shows a reconstruction of two early ancestors of the human species.<ref>[http://www.chisenhale.org.uk/archive/exhibitions/index.php?id=57] The Chisendale Gallery website</ref> The artists produced a version of these figures overlaid with their own facial features. The sculptures are installed so that they stand in isolation in an apparently infinite space. Their hairlessness evokes conflicting connotations; they could be the first humans or the last \u2013 cave people, or the survivors of a [[nuclear holocaust]].<ref name=\"Deitch\"/> Thus, the work continues the artist's concern with conflicting themes of impermanence and immortality. A year after beginning 'The New Barbarians' they made another version of the work, 'Masters of the Universe', 1998\u20132000. This uses the same sculptural model as the earlier work but is covered with hair.\n\n===''Electric Fountain''===\nThe 35-foot tall 'Electric Fountain', constructed from steel, neon tubing and 3,390 LED bulbs, was exhibited at [[Rockefeller Plaza]], New York, February 2008.<ref>Vogel, Carol [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/21/arts/design/21foun.html \"3 Coins Might Short Out This Fountain\"] ''The New York Times'', 21 February 2008</ref> 'Electric Fountain' (''see 'External links' below for video clip'') represents the artist's take on the world's oldest form of public art, the fountain. Said Webster: \"Electric Fountain mimics the tradition of a fountain as a monument found in public squares around the world, but its magic lies in the emulation of light where water should be.\" The fountain can be seen as both a celebration of contemporary culture and an ambiguous comment on the nature of consumer society, embodying themes that are often present in the duo's work.<ref name=\"Holzwarth\" />\n\n===''The Dirty House''===\nIn 2001, Tim Noble and Sue Webster bought a dilapidated early twentieth-century furniture factory in the East End of London, which would become their studio space.

A single light source illuminates the pile of rubbish thus casting a portrait in shadow, which contrasts sharply with the materials used to create it; the artists leaning against each other, back to back, enjoying a glass of wine and a cigarette.<ref name=\"MoMA\"/>\n\nJeffrey Deitch, the director of the [[Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art]], writes:\n{{quote|\"''Dirty White Trash (with Gulls)'' is a confluence of beauty and filth, form and anti-form. It is a work of art made out of the process of its own conception, an embodiment of formalist logic. At the same time, it is a negation of everything that formalism stands for&nbsp;... The artist is at the center of the work. It is deliberately entertaining, and revels in its own theatricality.\"<ref name=\"Deitch\"/>}}\n\nAnother work, 'British Wildlife' was created after Noble's father died in 2000. Using his collection of taxidermy animals, it is an assemblage of forty-six birds, forty mammals, and two stuffed fish, including a whole swan and even the pet crow Noble kept as a child.<ref name=\"Deitch\"/> The shadow formed by this mass of animals fittingly depicts back to back busts of the artists in a pose of grief.<ref>[http://allvisualarts.org/Exhibitions/VanitasTheTransienceofEarthlyPleasures.aspx All Visual Arts website]</ref>\n\nIn September 2000, they were invited to participate in 'Apocalypse', the [[Royal Academy]]'s follow up to the infamous [[Sensation exhibition]] of 1997.

When illuminated the sculpture cast a double profile portrait of the artists, illustrating how sexuality influences our perception of reality reflecting the sexuality that Freud discovered at the core of human life. Another work, 'Scarlett', 2006 (see below video on 'External link') was a \"''worktable on which numerous bizarre mechanical toys are working and seemingly in the process of being made; a nightmarish setting of repressed sexual and sadomasochistic fantasies and transgressions.''\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.freud.org.uk/exhibitions/10512/polymorphous-perverse/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107114859/http://www.freud.org.uk/exhibitions/10512/polymorphous-perverse/ |archivedate=7 January 2011 |df=dmy-all }} The Freud Museum website</ref>\n\n===Light sculptures===\nThe light sculptures, created in tandem with their shadow investigations, are constructed out of computer sequenced light-bulbs that perpetually flash, sending out messages of, often simultaneous, love and hate.

This is certainly the case with their early light sculpture, 'Toxic Schizophrenia', 1997. The relentlessly flashing heart with a knife stuck through it fuses a Christian emblem with a clich\u00e9 rock 'n' roll tattoo. As with the shadow sculptures, duality lies at its core; the work represents romance and pain, love and hate, friendship and alienation, negative and positive.<ref name=\"Rosenthal\"/>\n\nThe same contradictions resonate at the centre of their later work, 'Sacrificial Heart', 2008, a three-dimensional rotating version of 'Toxic Schizophrenia', which, like the earlier work, is both repellent and strangely alluring.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/reviews/tim-noble-and-sue-webster-gagosian-gallery-london-768435.html Darwent, Charles, Review of Gagosian show, London] ''The Independent'', 6 January 2008</ref><ref>[http://www.gagosian.com/exhibitions/2007-12-12_tim-noble-and-sue-webster/] Gagosian Gallery website</ref>'Toxic Schizophrenia (Hyper Version)' was their first permanent public sculpture, unveiled at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Denver, May 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mcadenver.org/index.php/about/noble_webster |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229215724/http://mcadenver.org/index.php/about/noble_webster |archivedate=29 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }} MCA Denver website</ref>\n\nContradictions and irony abound in the works exhibited at the [[Gagosian]], Beverley Hills exhibition, 'Instant Gratification', 2001.<ref name=\"Calder\"/> The twenty foot long revision of their original 1997 'Forever' is inextricably linked to the artist's earlier trips to Las Vegas, playing with the traditional connotations of the word, as the constantly flashing lights reinforce the idea of 'forever'.<ref name=\"Deitch\"/>\n\nWith 'A Pair of Dollars' they attempted to form an ironic response to the art market and art fairs, creating what Noble described as a 'vulgar' artwork, to demonstrate their annoyance with this system.<ref name=\"Zenth\"/> However, he has since acknowledged the failure of this irony, due to the huge success of the piece.<ref name=\"Zenth\"/>\n\n'Puny Undernourished Kid & Girlfriend from Hell' (''Puny Undernourished Kid shown left''), represents another return to earlier work, as it derives from cartoon-like drawings that Noble and Webster had made of each other ten years before.<ref name=\"Deitch\"/> These large neon figures are covered with neon tattoos of aggressive and forceful statements, clearly demonstrating the influence of punk rock on the artists.<ref name=\"Holzwarth\" />\n\n===Metal sculptures===\n'The Crack' (2004), is one in a series of welded metal sculptures which appear at first glance as abstract works in the tradition of [[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]] and Anthony Caro, while they actually work to reverse this abstraction into figuration.<ref name=\"Deitch\"/>\n\n'The Crack', a vertical column-like form, is possibly the most difficult of the artists' shadow works to decipher. Instead of focusing on the usual black silhouettes cast on the wall, the viewer must instead focus on the white space around the shadow, which reveals the naked bodies of the artists facing each other. This perceptual challenge brings to mind [[Ernst Gombrich]]'s discussion of perception in his famous 1960 book, 'Art and Illusion'.<ref>Gombrich, Ernst ''Art and Illusion: A Study in the Psychology of Pictorial Representation'' New York, 1960</ref> 'The Crack' displays at one moment an abstract shape that is perhaps reminiscent of a heroic mountain landscape by [[Clyfford Still]], with its cracks and gullies; gradually we begin to perceive the full-length naked profiles of our friends approaching each other, nipples touching, as though they are about to make love again for the millionth time.''<ref name=\"Rosenthal\"/>\n\n===The New Barbarians===\n[[File:The New Barbarians Tim Noble and Sue Webster.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The New Barbarians, 1997-9]]In 1997, Tim Noble and Sue Webster commissioned a sculptor from [[Madame Tussauds]] to help them create a life-size sculpture of themselves as [[australopithecines]]. Called 'The New Barbarians' (''left''), the work is based upon a diorama at the [[American Museum of Natural History]], New York, which shows a reconstruction of two early ancestors of the human species.<ref>[http://www.chisenhale.org.uk/archive/exhibitions/index.php?id=57] The Chisendale Gallery website</ref> The artists produced a version of these figures overlaid with their own facial features. The sculptures are installed so that they stand in isolation in an apparently infinite space. Their hairlessness evokes conflicting connotations; they could be the first humans or the last \u2013 cave people, or the survivors of a [[nuclear holocaust]].<ref name=\"Deitch\"/> Thus, the work continues the artist's concern with conflicting themes of impermanence and immortality. A year after beginning 'The New Barbarians' they made another version of the work, 'Masters of the Universe', 1998\u20132000. This uses the same sculptural model as the earlier work but is covered with hair.\n\n===''Electric Fountain''===\nThe 35-foot tall 'Electric Fountain', constructed from steel, neon tubing and 3,390 LED bulbs, was exhibited at [[Rockefeller Plaza]], New York, February 2008.<ref>Vogel, Carol [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/21/arts/design/21foun.html \"3 Coins Might Short Out This Fountain\"] ''The New York Times'', 21 February 2008</ref> 'Electric Fountain' (''see 'External links' below for video clip'') represents the artist's take on the world's oldest form of public art, the fountain. Said Webster: \"Electric Fountain mimics the tradition of a fountain as a monument found in public squares around the world, but its magic lies in the emulation of light where water should be.\" The fountain can be seen as both a celebration of contemporary culture and an ambiguous comment on the nature of consumer society, embodying themes that are often present in the duo's work.<ref name=\"Holzwarth\" />\n\n===''The Dirty House''===\nIn 2001, Tim Noble and Sue Webster bought a dilapidated early twentieth-century furniture factory in the East End of London, which would become their studio space.

Up until that point, Israel's economy had been essentially based on agriculture, mining and secondary sectors such as diamond polishing and manufacturing in textiles, fertilizers and plastics.\n\nThe key factor which enabled high-tech industries based on information and communication technologies to take root and flourish in Israel was investment by the defense and aerospace industries, which spawned new technologies and know-how. Israel devoted 17.1% of its GDP to military expenditure in 1988. Even though this share had dropped to 5.8% of GDP by 2016, Israel military spending remains among the highest in the world. For the purposes of comparison, the United States devoted 5.7% of its GDP to military expenditure in 1988 and 3.3% in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sipri.org/databases/milex|title=Military expenditure databases|last=|first=|date=|website=Stockholm International Peace Research Institute|accessdate=17 May 2017}}</ref> This heavy investment in defence and aerospace formed the basis for Israel's high-tech industries in medical devices, electronics, telecommunications, computer software and hardware.\n\nThe massive [[Russian immigration to Israel in the 1990s|Russian immigration]] of the 1990s reinforced this phenomenon, doubling the number of engineers and scientists in Israel overnight. Between 1989 and 2006, about 979 000 Russian Jews and their relatives migrated to Israel, which had a population of just 4.5 million in 1989.<ref name=\":0a\" />\n\nThe purchase of [[Mirabilis (company)|Mirabilis]] in 1998 was the first big exit of high tech in Israel and caused rush of Israeli companies as part of [[Dot-com bubble]].\n\nToday, Israel has the world's most research-intensive business sector; in 2013, it alone performed 3.49% of GDP. Competitive grants and tax incentives are the two main policy instruments supporting business research and development. Thanks to government incentives and the availability of highly trained human capital, Israel has become an attractive location for the research centres of leading multinationals. The country's national innovation ecosystem relies on both foreign multinationals and large corporate investors in research and development, as well as on start-ups. According to the Israel Venture Capital Database, 264 foreign research centres are currently active in Israel. Many of these centres are owned by large multinational firms that have acquired Israeli companies, technology and know-how and transformed them through mergers and acquisitions into their own local research facilities. The activity of some research centres even spans more than three decades, such as those of Intel, Applied Materials, Motorola and IBM.<ref name=\":0a\" />\n\nIn 2011, foreign research centres employed 33,700 workers through local subsidiaries, two-thirds of whom (23,700) worked in research and development. The same year, these research centres spent a total of NIS 14.17 billion on research and development across the full spectrum of industry, up from 17% over the previous year.<ref name=\":0a\" />\n\n== Higher education policy ==\n\n=== Sixth Higher Education Plan ===\nIsrael's higher education system is regulated by the Council for Higher Education and its Planning and Budgeting Committee. The Israeli higher education system operates under a multi-year plan agreed upon by the Planning and Budgeting Committee (PBC) and the Ministry of Finance. Each plan determines policy objectives and, accordingly, the budgets to be allocated in order to achieve these objectives.<ref name=\":0a\" />\n\nThe annual government allocation to universities totalled about US$1 750 million in 2015, providing 50\u201375% of their operating budgets. Much of the remainder of their operating budget (15\u201320%) comes from annual student tuition fees, which are uniform at about US$2 750 per year. The ''Sixth Higher Education Plan'' (2011\u20132016) makes provision for a 30% rise in the Council for Higher Education's budget. The ''Sixth Plan'' changes the budgeting model of the PBC by placing greater emphasis on excellence in research, along with quantitative measures for the number of students. Under this model, 75% of the committee's budget (NIS 7 billion over six years) is being allocated to institutions offering higher education. The ''Sixth Higher Education Plan'' launched the Israeli Centres of Research Excellence (I-CORE) programme in October 2011. This reflects a renewed interest in funding academic research and constitutes a strong indication of a reversal in government policy.<ref name=\":0a\" />\n\n=== Israeli Centres of Research Excellence ===\nThe Israeli Centres of Research Excellence (I-CORE) programme, which dates from 2011, envisions the establishment of cross-institutional clusters of top researchers in specific fields and returning young Israeli scientists from abroad, with each centre being endowed with state-of-the-art research infrastructure. The ''Sixth Higher Education Plan'' invests NIS 300 million over six years in upgrading and renovating academic infrastructure and research facilities.<ref name=\":0a\" />\n\nI-CORE is run jointly by the Council for Higher Education's Planning and Budgeting Committee and the Israel Science Foundation. By 2015, 16 centres had been established in two waves across a wide spectrum of research areas: six specialize in life sciences and medicine, five in the exact sciences and engineering, three in social sciences and law and two in humanities. Each centre of excellence has been selected via a peer review process conducted by the Israel Science Foundation. By May 2014, around 60 young researchers had been absorbed into these centres, many of whom had previously worked abroad.<ref name=\":0a\" />\n\nThe research topics of each centre are selected through a broad bottom-up process consisting of consultations with the Israeli academic community, in order to ensure that they reflect the genuine priorities and scientific interests of Israeli researchers.<ref name=\":0a\" />\n\nI-CORE is funded by the Council for Higher Education, the host institutions and strategic business partners, with a total budget of NIS 1.35 billion (US$365 million). The original goal was to set up 30 centres of research excellence in Israel by 2016. However, the establishment of the remaining 14 centres has provisionally been shelved, for lack of sufficient external capital.<ref name=\":0a\" />\n\nIn 2013\u20132014, the Planning and Budgeting Committee's budget for the entire I-CORE programme amounted to NIS 87.9 million, equivalent to about 1% of the total for higher education that year. This budget appears to be insufficient to create the critical mass of researchers in various academic fields and thus falls short of the programme's objective. The level of government support for the centres of excellence has grown each year since 2011 as new centres have been established and is expected to reach NIS 93.6 million by 2015\u20132016 before dropping to 33.7 million in 2017\u20132018. According to the funding model, government support should represent one-third ofall funding, another third being funded by the participating universities and the remaining third by donors or investors.<ref name=\":0a\" />\n\n=== University recruitment targets ===\nIn the 2012\u20132013 academic year, there were 4,066 faculty members. The targets fixed by the Planning and Budgeting Committee for faculty recruitment are ambitious: universities are to recruit another 1 600 senior faculty within the six-year period \u2013 about half of whom will occupy new positions and half will replace faculty expected to retire. This will constitute a net increase of more than 15% in university faculty. In colleges, another 400 new positions are to be created, entailing a 25% net increase. The new faculty will be hired via the institutions\u2019 regular recruitment channels, some in specific research areas, through the Israeli Centers of Research Excellence program.<ref name=\":0a\" />\n\nThe increase in faculty numbers will also reduce the student-to-faculty ratio, the target being to achieve a ratio of 21.5 university students to every faculty member, compared to 24.3 at present, and 35 students for every faculty member in colleges, compared to 38 at present. This increase in the number of faculty positions, alongside the upgrading of research and teaching infrastructure and the increase in competitive research funds, should help Israel to staunch brain drain by enabling the best Israeli researchers at home and abroad to conduct their academic work in Israel, if they so wish, at institutions offering the highest academic standards.<ref name=\":0a\" />\n\nThe new budgeting scheme described above is mainly concerned with the human and research infrastructure in universities. Most of the physical development (e.g. buildings) and scientific infrastructure (e.g. laboratories and expensive equipment) of universities comes from philanthropic donations, primarily from the American Jewish community (CHE, 2014). This latter source of funding has greatly compensated for the lack of sufficient government funding for universities up until now but it is expected to diminish significantly in the years to come. Unless the government invests more in research infrastructure, Israel's universities will be ill-equipped and insufficiently funded to meet the challenges of the 21st century.<ref name=\":0a\" />\n\n=== Expanding access to higher education ===\nIsrael has offered virtually universal access to its universities and academic colleges since the wave of Jewish immigration from the former Soviet Union in the 1990s prompted the establishment of numerous tertiary institutions to absorb the additional demand. However, the Arab and ultra-orthodox minorities still attend university in insufficient numbers. The ''Sixth Higher Education Plan'' places emphasis on encouraging minority groups to enroll in higher education. Two years after the ''Mahar'' program was implemented in late 2012 for the ultra-orthodox population, student enrollment had grown by 1400. Twelve new programs for ultra-orthodox students have since been established, three of them on university campuses. Meanwhile, the Pluralism and Equal Opportunity in Higher Education program addresses the barriers to integration of the Arab minority in the higher education system. Its scope ranges from providing secondary-school guidance through preparation for academic studies to offering students comprehensive support in their first year of study, a stage normally characterized by a high drop-out rate. The program renews the ''Ma\u2019of'' fund supporting outstanding young Arab faculty members. Since the introduction of this program in 1995, the ''Ma\u2019of'' fund has opened tenure track opportunities for nearly 100 Arab lecturers, who act as role models for younger Arab students embarking on their own academic careers.<ref name=\":0a\" />\n\n== Science, technology and innovation policy ==\n\n=== Policy framework ===\nAlthough Israel does not have an \u2018umbrella type\u2019 policy for science, technology and innovation optimizing priorities and allocating resources, it does implement, ''de facto'', an undeclared set of best practices combining bottom-up and top-down processes via government offices, such as those of the Chief Scientist or the Minister of Science, Technology and Space, as well as ad hoc organizations like the Telem forum. The procedure for selecting research projects for the Israeli centers for research excellence is one example of this bottom-up process.<ref name=\":0a\" />\n\nIsrael has no specific legislation regulating the transfer of knowledge from the academic sector to the general public and industry. Nevertheless, the Israeli government influences policy formulation by universities and technology transfer by providing incentives and subsidies through programmes such as Magnet and Magneton, as well as through regulation. There were attempts in 2004 and 2005 to introduce bills encouraging the transfer of knowledge and technology for the public benefit but, as these attempts failed, each university has since defined its own policy.<ref name=\":0a\" />\n\nThe Israeli economy is driven by industries based on electronics, computers and communication technologies, the result of over 50 years of investment in the country's defence infrastructure. Israeli defence industries have traditionally focused on electronics, avionics and related systems. The development of these systems has given Israeli high-tech industries a qualitative edge in civilian spin-offs in the software, communications and Internet sectors. However, the next waves of high technologies are expected to emanate from other disciplines, including molecular biology, biotechnology and pharmaceuticals, nanotechnology, material sciences and chemistry, in intimate synergy with information and communication technologies. These disciplines are rooted in the basic research laboratories of universities rather than the defence industries. This poses a dilemma. In the absence of a national policy for universities, let alone for the higher education system as a whole, it is not clear how these institutions will manage to supply the knowledge, skills and human resources needed for these new science-based industries.<ref name=\":0a\" />\n\n=== Evaluation of science policy instruments ===\nThe country's various policy instruments are evaluated by the Council for Higher Education, the National Council for Research and Development, the Office of the Chief Scientist, the Academy of Sciences and Humanities and the Ministry of Finance. In recent years, the Magnet administration in the Office of the Chief Scientist has initiated several evaluations of its own policy instruments, most of which have been carried out by independent research institutions. One such evaluation was carried out in 2010 by the Samuel Neaman Institute; it concerned the Nofar programme within the Magnet directorate. Nofar tries to bridge basic and applied research, before the commercial potential of a project has caught the eye of industry. The main recommendation was for Nofar to extend programme funding to emerging technological domains beyond biotechnology and nanotechnology. The Office of the Chief Scientist accepted this recommendation and, consequently, decided to fund projects in the fields of medical devices, water and energy technology and multidisciplinary research.<ref name=\":0a\" />\n\nAn additional evaluation was carried out in 2008 by Applied Economics, an economic and management research-based consultancy, on the contribution of the high-tech sector to economic productivity in Israel. It found that the output per worker in companies that received support from the Office of the Chief Scientist was 19% higher than in \u2018twin\u2019 companies that had not received this support. The same year, a committee headed by Israel Makov examined the Office of the Chief Scientist's support for research and development in large companies. The committee found economic justification for providing incentives for these companies.<ref name=\":0a\" />\n\n===  Research funding programmes ===\nThe Israeli Science Foundation is the main source of research funding in Israel and receives administrative support from the Academy of Sciences and Humanities. The foundation provides competitive grants in three areas: exact sciences and technology; life sciences and medicine; and humanities and social sciences. Complementary funding is provided by binational foundations, such as the [[USA\u2013Israel Binational Science Foundation]] (est. 1972) and the [[German\u2013Israeli Foundation for Scientific Research and Development]] (est. 1986).<ref name=\":0a\" />\n\nThe Ministry of Science, Technology and Space funds thematic research centres and is responsible for international scientific co-operation. The Ministry's National Infrastructure Programme aims to create a critical mass of knowledge in national priority fields and to nurture the younger generation of scientists. Investment in the programme mainly takes the form of research grants, scholarships and knowledge centres. Over 80% of the ministry's budget is channelled towards research in academic institutions and research institutes, as well as towards revamping scientific infrastructure by upgrading existing research facilities and establishing new ones. In 2012, the ministry resolved to invest NIS 120 million over three years in four designated priority areas for research: brain science; supercomputing and cybersecurity; oceanography; and alternative transportation fuels. An expert panel headed by the Chief Scientist in the Ministry of Science, Technology and Space chose these four broad disciplines in the belief that they would be likely to exert the greatest practical impact on Israeli life in the near future.<ref name=\":0a\" />\n\nThe main ongoing programmes managed by the Office of the Chief Scientist within the Ministry of the Economy are: the Research and Development Fund; Magnet Tracks (est. 1994; Tnufa (est. 2001) and the Incubator Programme (est.1991). Between 2010 and 2014, the Office of the Chief Scientist initiated several new programmes:<ref name=\":0a\" />\n* Grand Challenges Israel (since 2014): an Israeli contribution to the Grand Challenges in Global Health programme, which is dedicated to tackling global health and food security challenges in developing countries; Grand Challenges Israel is offering grants of up to NIS 500 000 at the proof of concept/feasibility study stage.\n* Research and development in the field of space technology (2012): encourages research to find technological solutions in various fields.\n* Technological Entrepreneurship Incubators (2014): encourages entrepreneurial technology and supports start-up technology companies.\n* Magnet \u2013 Kamin programme (2014) provides direct support for applied research in academia that has potential for commercial application.\n* Cyber \u2013 Kidma programme (2014): promotes Israel's cybersecurity industry.\n* Cleantech \u2013 Renewable Energy Technology Centre (2012): supports research through projects involving private\u2013public partnerships in the field of renewable energy.\n* Life Sciences Fund (2010): finances the projects of Israeli companies, with emphasis on biopharmaceuticals, established together with the Ministry of Finance and the private sector.\n* Biotechnology \u2013 Tzatam programme (2011): provides equipment to support research and development in life sciences. The Chief Scientist supports industrial organizations and the PBC provides research institutions with assistance.\n* Investment in high-tech industries (2011): encourages financial institutions to invest in knowledge-based industries, through a collaboration between the Office of the Chief Scientist and the Ministry of Finance.\nAnother source of public research funding is the Forum for National Research and Development Infrastructure (Telem). This voluntary partnership involves the Office of the Chief Scientist of the Ministry of the Economy and the Ministry of Science, Technology and Space, the Planning and Budgeting Committee and the Ministry of Finance. Telem projects focus on establishing infrastructure for research and development in areas that are of common interest to most Telem partners. These projects are financed by the Telem members\u2019 own resources.<ref name=\":0a\" />\n\n=== Trends in research funding ===\nIn 2014, Israel topped the world for research &nbsp;intensity, reflecting the importance of research and innovation for the economy. Since 2008, however, Israel's research intensity has weakened somewhat (4.21% of GDP in 2013), even as this ratio has experienced impressive growth in the Republic of Korea (4.15% in 2014), Denmark (3.06% in 2013) and Germany (2.94% in 2013). The OECD average was 2.40% of GDP in 2014. Business expenditure on research and development (BERD) continues to account for ~84% of GERD, or 3.49% of GDP.<ref name=\":0a\" />\n\nThe share of higher education in gross domestic expenditure on research and development (GERD) has decreased since 2003 from 0.69% of GDP to 0.59% of GDP (2013). Despite this drop, Israel ranks 8th among OECD countries for this indicator. The lion's share of GERD (45.6%) in Israel is financed by foreign companies, reflecting the large scale of activity by foreign multinational companies and research centres in the country.<ref name=\":0a\" />\n\nThe share of foreign funding in university-performed research is also quite significant (21.8%). By the end of 2014, Israel had received \u20ac875.6 million from the European Union's (EU's) Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2007\u20132013), 70% of which had gone to universities. Its successor, [[Horizon 2020]] (2014\u20132020), has been endowed with nearly \u20ac80 billion in funding, making it the EU's most ambitious research and innovation programme ever. As of February 2015, Israel had received \u20ac119.8 million from the Horizon 2020 programme.<ref name=\":0a\" />\n\nIn 2013, more than half (51.5%) of government spending was allocated to university research and an additional 29.9% to the development of industrial technologies. Research expenditure on health and the environment has doubled in absolute terms in the past decade but still accounts for less than 1% of total government GERD. Israel is unique among OECD countries in its distribution of government support by objective. Israel ranks at the bottom in government support of research in health care, environmental quality and infrastructure development.<ref name=\":0a\" />\n\nThere has been insufficient government funding for universities in recent years. University research in Israel is largely grounded in basic research, even though it also engages in applied research and partnerships with industry. Basic research in Israel only accounted for 13% of research expenditure in 2013, compared to 16% in 2006. There has since been an increase in General University Funds and those destined for non-oriented research.<ref name=\":0a\" />\n\n=== Trends in human resources ===\nIn 2012, there were 77 282 full-time equivalent researchers in Israel, 82% of whom had acquired an academic education, 10% of whom were practical engineers and technicians and 8% of whom held other qualifications. Eight out of ten (83.8%) were employed in the business sector, 1.1% in the government sector, 14.4% in the higher education sector and 0.7% in non-profit institutions.<ref name=\":0a\" />\n\nIn 2011, 28% of senior academic staff were women, up by 5% over the previous decade (from 25% in 2005). Although the representation of women has increased, it remains very low in engineering (14%), physical sciences (11%), mathematics and computer sciences (10%) relative to education (52%) and paramedical occupations (63%).<ref name=\":0a\" />\n\nThere is a visible ageing of scientists and engineers in some fields. For instance, about three-quarters of researchers in the physical sciences are over the age of 50 and the proportion is even higher for practical engineers and technicians. The shortage of professional staff will be a major handicap for the national innovation system in the coming years, as the growing demand for engineers and technical professionals begins to outpace supply.&nbsp;<ref name=\":0a\" />\n\nDuring the 2012/2013 academic year, 34% of bachelor's degrees were obtained in fields related to science and engineering in Israel. This compares well with the proportion in the Republic of Korea (40%) and most Western countries (about 30% on average). The proportion of Israeli graduates in scientific disciplines and engineering was slightly lower at the master's level (27%) but dominated at PhD level (56%).<ref name=\":0a\" />\n\nRecent statistics support the assertion that Israel may be living on the \u2018fruits of the past\u2019, that is to say, on the heavy investment made in primary, secondary and tertiary education during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. Between 2007 and 2013, the number of graduates in physical sciences, biological sciences and agriculture dropped, even though the total number of university graduates progressed by 19% (to 39 654). Recent data reveal that Israeli educational achievements in the core curricular subjects of mathematics and science are low in comparison to other OECD countries, as revealed by the exam results of Israeli 15-year olds in the OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment. Public spending on primary education has also fallen below the OECD average. The public education budget accounted for 6.9% of GDP in 2002 but only 5.6% in 2011. The share of this budget going to tertiary education has remained stable at 16\u201318% but, as a share of GDP, has passed under the bar of 1%. There is concern at the deteriorating quality of teachers at all levels of education and the lack of stringent demands on students to strive for excellence.<ref name=\":0a\" />\n\nIn recent years, Israel encountered the problem of shortage of specialists in the [[High tech|high-tech industry]].

Consequently, the number of Israeli publications per million inhabitants also declined: between 2008 and 2013, it dropped from 1 488 to 1 431; this trend reflects a relative constancy in scholarly output in the face of relatively high population growth (1.1% in 2014) for a developed country and near-zero growth in the number of full-time equivalent researchers in universities. Between 2005 and 2014, Israeli scientific output was particularly high in life sciences. Israeli universities do particularly well in computer science but publications in this field tend to appear mostly in conference proceedings, which are not included in the Web of Science.<ref name=\":0a\" />\n\nIsraeli publications have a high citation rate and a high share of papers count among the 10 percent most-cited.

This evolution has been a corollary of the rise of the electronics industry and information technology services, along with a surge in the number of research personnel following the wave of immigration from the former Soviet Union.<ref name=\":0a\" />\n\nIsrael has no specific legislation regulating the transfer of knowledge from the academic sector to the general public and industry.  There were attempts in 2004 and 2005 to introduce bills encouraging the transfer of knowledge and technology for the public benefit but, as these attempts failed, each university has since defined its own policy.<ref name=\":0a\" />\n\n=== University-industry collaboration ===\nAll Israeli research universities have technology transfer offices. Recent research conducted by the Samuel Neaman Institute has revealed that, between 2004 and 2013, the universities\u2019 share of patent applications constituted 10\u201312% of the total inventive activity of Israeli applicants. This is one of the highest shares in the world and is largely due to the intensive activity of the universities\u2019 technology transfer offices. The Weizmann Institute's technology transfer office, Yeda, has been ranked the third-most profitable in the world. Through exemplary university\u2013industry collaboration, the Weizmann Institute of Science and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries have discovered and developed the Copaxone drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Copaxone is Teva's biggest-selling drug, with US$1.68 billion in sales in the first half of 2011. Since the drug's approval by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1996, it is estimated that the Weizmann Institute of Science has earned nearly US$2 billion in royalties from the commercialization of its intellectual property.<ref name=\":0a\" />\n\n=== International technology transfer ===\nIn 2007, the [[United Nations]] General Assembly's [[United Nations General Assembly Second Committee|Economic and Financial Committee]] adopted an Israeli-sponsored draft resolution on agricultural technology transfer to developing countries. The resolution called on developed countries to make their knowledge and know-how accessible to the developing world as part of the UN campaign to eradicate hunger and dire poverty by 2015.

Between 2004 and 2013, the Israeli venture capital industry played a fundamental role in funding the development of Israel's high-tech sector. In 2013, Israeli companies had raised more venture capital as a share of GDP than companies in any other country as it attracted US$2 346 million alone during that year. Today, Israel is considered one of the biggest venture capital centers in the world outside the United States of America. Several factors have contributed to this growth. These include tax exemptions on Israeli venture capital, funds established in conjunction with large international banks and financial companies and the involvement of major organizations desirous to capitalize on the strengths of Israeli high-tech companies. These organizations include some of the world's largest multinational technology companies, including [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Cisco Systems|Cisco]], [[Google]], [[IBM]], [[Intel]], [[Microsoft]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[Siemens]] and [[Samsung]]. In recent years, the share of venture capital invested in the growth stages of enterprises has flourished at the expense of early stage investments.<ref name=\":0a\" /> Nowadays, Israeli companies are considered to be more popular than their American peers. For comparison, investments volume in Israeli startups grew by 140% during 2014-2018 and investments in technological startups from the U.S. grew by 64%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://8allocate.com/article/through-the-thorns-to-the-stars-israeli-startups-ecosystem-2019/|title=Through the Thorns to the Stars: Israeli Startups Ecosystem 2019|date=2019-07-08|website=8allocate|language=en-US|accessdate=2019-10-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Start-Up Nation Central's Annual Ecosystem 2019 Report|url=https://lp.startupnationcentral.org/annualreport/|journal=Start-Up Nation Central|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n== Intellectual property rights ==\nIntellectual property rights in Israel protect copyright and performers\u2019 rights, trademarks, geographical indicators, patents, industrial designs, topographies of integrated circuits, plant breeds and undisclosed business secrets. Both contemporary Israeli legislation and case law are influenced by laws and practices in modern countries, particularly Anglo-American law, the emerging body of EU law and proposals by international organizations.<ref name=\":0a\" />\n\nIsrael has made a concerted effort to improve the economy's ability to benefit from an enhanced system of intellectual property rights. This includes increasing the resources of the Israel Patent Office, upgrading enforcement activities and implementing programmes to bring ideas funded by government research to the market. Between 2002 and 2012, foreigners accounted for nearly 80% of the patent applications filed with the Israel Patent Office. A sizeable{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=May 2017}} share of foreign applicants seeking protection from the Israel Patent Office are pharmaceutical companies such as F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Janssen, Novartis, Merck, Bayer-Schering, Sanofi-Aventis and Pfizer, which happen to be the main business competitors of Israel's own Teva Pharmaceutical Industries.<ref name=\":0a\" />\n\nIsrael ranks tenth in the world for the number of patent applications filed with the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) by country of residence of the first-named inventor. Israeli inventors file far more applications with USPTO (5 436 in 2011) than with the [[European Patent Office]] (EPO). Moreover, the number of Israeli filings with EPO dropped from 1400 to 1063 between 2006 and 2011. This preference for USPTO is largely because foreign research centres implanted in Israel are primarily owned by US firms such as [[IBM]], Intel, Sandisk, Microsoft, Applied Materials, Qualcomm, Motorola, Google or Hewlett\u2013Packard. The inventions of these companies are attributed to Israel as the inventor of the patent but not as the owner (applicant or assignee). The loss of intellectual property into the hands of multinationals occurs mainly through the recruitment of the best Israeli talent by the local research centres of multinational firms. Although the Israeli economy benefits from the activity of the multinationals\u2019 subsidiaries through job creation and other means, the advantages are relatively small compared to the potential economic gains that might have been achieved, had this intellectual property been utilized to support and foster the expansion of mature Israeli companies of a considerable size.<ref name=\":0a\" />\n\n== Applied science and engineering ==\n\n=== Energy ===\n\n==== Solar power ====\n{{Further|Solar power in Israel}}\n[[File:Solar dish at Ben-Gurion National Solar Energy Center in Israel.jpg|thumb|The world's largest solar parabolic dish at the [[Ben-Gurion National Solar Energy Center]]<ref name=Register>{{cite news |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/01/25/faiman_negev_solar_plan/ |title=Giant solar plants in Negev could power Israel's future |first=John |last=Lettice |newspaper=The Register |date=25 January 2008}}</ref>|alt=A horizontal parabolic dish, with a triangular structure on its top.]]\nAs of 2014, Israel leads the 2014 Global Cleantech Innovation Index.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cleantechinnvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Cleantech-Innovation-Index-2014.pdf|title=The Global Cleantech Innovation Index 2014|author=|date=|website=CleanTechInnvest.com|accessdate=16 May 2017}}</ref>\nThe country's lack of conventional energy sources has spurred extensive research and development of alternative energy sources and Israel has developed innovative technologies in the [[Solar power in Israel|solar energy field]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Seven solar technologies from Israel that could change our planet |first=Karin |last=Kloosterman |url=http://israel21c.org/environment/seven-solar-technologies-from-israel-that-could-change-our-planet/ |newspaper=ISRAEL21c |date=27 October 2009 |accessdate=14 October 2012}}</ref> Israel has become the world's largest per capita user of solar water heaters in the home.

This multidisciplinary task-force brings together Technion's top researchers in energy science and technology from over nine different faculties. GTEP's 4-point strategy targets research and development of alternative fuels; renewable energy sources; energy storage and conversion; and energy conservation. GTEP is presently the only center in Israel offering graduate studies in energy science and technology to bring the energy skills and know-how to address the energy challenges of the future.\n\n==== Natural gas ====\nSince 1999, large reserves of natural gas have been discovered off Israel's coast. This fossil fuel has become the primary fuel for electricity generation in Israel and is gradually replacing oil and coal. &nbsp;In 2010, 37% of electricity in Israel was generated from natural gas, leading to savings of US$1.4 billion for the economy. In 2015, this rate is expected to surpass 55%.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=Israel.

This is giving companies a competitive advantage by reducing their energy costs and lowering national emissions. Since early 2013, almost the entire natural gas consumption of Israel has been supplied by the Tamar field, an Israeli\u2013American private partnership. The estimated reserves amount to about 1 000 BCM, securing Israel's energy needs for many decades to come and making Israel a potentially major regional exporter of natural gas. In 2014, initial export agreements were signed with the Palestinian Authority, Jordan and Egypt; there are also plans to export natural gas to Turkey and the EU via Greece.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 2011, the government asked the Academy of Sciences and Humanities to convene a panel of experts to consider the full range of implications of the most recent discoveries of natural gas. The panel recommended encouraging research into fossil fuels, training engineers and focusing research efforts on the impact of gas production on the Mediterranean Sea's ecosystem. The Mediterranean Sea Research Centre of Israel was established in 2012 with an initial budget of NIS 70 million; new study programmes have since been launched at the centre to train engineers and other professionals for the oil and gas industry. Meanwhile, the Office of the Chief Scientist, among others, plans to use Israel's fledgling natural gas industry as a stepping stone to building capacity in advanced technology and opening up opportunities for Israeli innovation targeting the global oil and gas markets.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Space science and technology ===\n{{Further|Israel Space Agency}}\n[[File:Shavit Ofek7a.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Ofek-7]] satellite launch through [[Shavit]] vehicle]]\nDuring the 1970s  and 1980s Israel began developing the [[infrastructure]] needed for research and development in [[space exploration]] and related sciences.

Major acquisitions of Israeli start-ups in 2014 include Intellinx, purchased by Bottomline Technologies, and Cyvera, purchased by Palo Alto Networks.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe National Cyber Bureau has estimated that the number of Israeli cyberdefence companies had doubled in the past five years to about 300 by 2014. Israeli companies account for an estimated 10% of global sales, which currently total an estimated US$60 billion. Total research spending on cyberdefence in Israel quadrupled between 2010 and 2014 from US$50 million to US$200 million, bringing Israel's spending to about 15% of global research spending on cyberdefence in 2014. Cybersecurity technologies are exported by Israel in accordance with the Wassenaar Arrangement, a multilateral agreement on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technologies.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Hydraulic engineering ===\n{{See also|Water supply and sanitation in Israel}}\nSince rain falls only in the winter, and largely in the northern part of the country, irrigation and [[Hydraulic engineering|water engineering]] is vital to the country's economic survival and growth. Large-scale projects to direct water from rivers and reservoirs in the north, to make optimal use of groundwater, and to reclaim flood overflow and sewage have been undertaken. The largest such project was a national water distribution system called the National Carrier, completed in 1964, flowing from the country's biggest freshwater lake, the [[Sea of Galilee]], to the northern [[Negev]] desert, through huge channels, pipes and tunnels.<ref>Sachar, Howard M., \u201cA history of Israel: from the rise of Zionism to our time\u201d, Alfred A.

Up until that point, Israel's economy had been essentially based on agriculture, mining and secondary sectors such as diamond polishing and manufacturing in textiles, fertilizers and plastics.\n\nThe key factor which enabled high-tech industries based on information and communication technologies to take root and flourish in Israel was investment by the defense and aerospace industries, which spawned new technologies and know-how. Israel devoted 17.1% of its GDP to military expenditure in 1988. Even though this share had dropped to 5.8% of GDP by 2016, Israel military spending remains among the highest in the world. For the purposes of comparison, the United States devoted 5.7% of its GDP to military expenditure in 1988 and 3.3% in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sipri.org/databases/milex|title=Military expenditure databases|last=|first=|date=|website=Stockholm International Peace Research Institute|access-date=17 May 2017}}</ref> This heavy investment in defence and aerospace formed the basis for Israel's high-tech industries in medical devices, electronics, telecommunications, computer software and hardware.\n\nThe massive [[Russian immigration to Israel in the 1990s|Russian immigration]] of the 1990s reinforced this phenomenon, doubling the number of engineers and scientists in Israel overnight. Between 1989 and 2006, about 979 000 Russian Jews and their relatives migrated to Israel, which had a population of just 4.5 million in 1989.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe purchase of [[Mirabilis (company)|Mirabilis]] in 1998 was the first big exit of high tech in Israel and caused rush of Israeli companies as part of [[Dot-com bubble]].\n\nToday, Israel has the world's most research-intensive business sector; in 2013, it alone performed 3.49% of GDP. Competitive grants and tax incentives are the two main policy instruments supporting business research and development. Thanks to government incentives and the availability of highly trained human capital, Israel has become an attractive location for the research centres of leading multinationals. The country's national innovation ecosystem relies on both foreign multinationals and large corporate investors in research and development, as well as on start-ups. According to the Israel Venture Capital Database, 264 foreign research centres are currently active in Israel. Many of these centres are owned by large multinational firms that have acquired Israeli companies, technology and know-how and transformed them through mergers and acquisitions into their own local research facilities. The activity of some research centres even spans more than three decades, such as those of Intel, Applied Materials, Motorola and IBM.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 2011, foreign research centres employed 33,700 workers through local subsidiaries, two-thirds of whom (23,700) worked in research and development. The same year, these research centres spent a total of NIS 14.17 billion on research and development across the full spectrum of industry, up from 17% over the previous year.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Higher education policy ==\n\n=== Sixth Higher Education Plan ===\nIsrael's higher education system is regulated by the Council for Higher Education and its Planning and Budgeting Committee. The Israeli higher education system operates under a multi-year plan agreed upon by the Planning and Budgeting Committee (PBC) and the Ministry of Finance. Each plan determines policy objectives and, accordingly, the budgets to be allocated in order to achieve these objectives.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe annual government allocation to universities totalled about US$1 750 million in 2015, providing 50\u201375% of their operating budgets. Much of the remainder of their operating budget (15\u201320%) comes from annual student tuition fees, which are uniform at about US$2 750 per year. The ''Sixth Higher Education Plan'' (2011\u20132016) makes provision for a 30% rise in the Council for Higher Education's budget. The ''Sixth Plan'' changes the budgeting model of the PBC by placing greater emphasis on excellence in research, along with quantitative measures for the number of students. Under this model, 75% of the committee's budget (NIS 7 billion over six years) is being allocated to institutions offering higher education. The ''Sixth Higher Education Plan'' launched the Israeli Centres of Research Excellence (I-CORE) programme in October 2011. This reflects a renewed interest in funding academic research and constitutes a strong indication of a reversal in government policy.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Israeli Centres of Research Excellence ===\nThe Israeli Centres of Research Excellence (I-CORE) programme, which dates from 2011, envisions the establishment of cross-institutional clusters of top researchers in specific fields and returning young Israeli scientists from abroad, with each centre being endowed with state-of-the-art research infrastructure. The ''Sixth Higher Education Plan'' invests NIS 300 million over six years in upgrading and renovating academic infrastructure and research facilities.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nI-CORE is run jointly by the Council for Higher Education's Planning and Budgeting Committee and the Israel Science Foundation. By 2015, 16 centres had been established in two waves across a wide spectrum of research areas: six specialize in life sciences and medicine, five in the exact sciences and engineering, three in social sciences and law and two in humanities. Each centre of excellence has been selected via a peer review process conducted by the Israel Science Foundation. By May 2014, around 60 young researchers had been absorbed into these centres, many of whom had previously worked abroad.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe research topics of each centre are selected through a broad bottom-up process consisting of consultations with the Israeli academic community, in order to ensure that they reflect the genuine priorities and scientific interests of Israeli researchers.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nI-CORE is funded by the Council for Higher Education, the host institutions and strategic business partners, with a total budget of NIS 1.35 billion (US$365 million). The original goal was to set up 30 centres of research excellence in Israel by 2016. However, the establishment of the remaining 14 centres has provisionally been shelved, for lack of sufficient external capital.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 2013\u20132014, the Planning and Budgeting Committee's budget for the entire I-CORE programme amounted to NIS 87.9 million, equivalent to about 1% of the total for higher education that year. This budget appears to be insufficient to create the critical mass of researchers in various academic fields and thus falls short of the programme's objective. The level of government support for the centres of excellence has grown each year since 2011 as new centres have been established and is expected to reach NIS 93.6 million by 2015\u20132016 before dropping to 33.7 million in 2017\u20132018. According to the funding model, government support should represent one-third ofall funding, another third being funded by the participating universities and the remaining third by donors or investors.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== University recruitment targets ===\nIn the 2012\u20132013 academic year, there were 4,066 faculty members. The targets fixed by the Planning and Budgeting Committee for faculty recruitment are ambitious: universities are to recruit another 1 600 senior faculty within the six-year period \u2013 about half of whom will occupy new positions and half will replace faculty expected to retire. This will constitute a net increase of more than 15% in university faculty. In colleges, another 400 new positions are to be created, entailing a 25% net increase. The new faculty will be hired via the institutions\u2019 regular recruitment channels, some in specific research areas, through the Israeli Centers of Research Excellence program.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe increase in faculty numbers will also reduce the student-to-faculty ratio, the target being to achieve a ratio of 21.5 university students to every faculty member, compared to 24.3 at present, and 35 students for every faculty member in colleges, compared to 38 at present. This increase in the number of faculty positions, alongside the upgrading of research and teaching infrastructure and the increase in competitive research funds, should help Israel to staunch brain drain by enabling the best Israeli researchers at home and abroad to conduct their academic work in Israel, if they so wish, at institutions offering the highest academic standards.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe new budgeting scheme described above is mainly concerned with the human and research infrastructure in universities. Most of the physical development (e.g. buildings) and scientific infrastructure (e.g. laboratories and expensive equipment) of universities comes from philanthropic donations, primarily from the American Jewish community (CHE, 2014). This latter source of funding has greatly compensated for the lack of sufficient government funding for universities up until now but it is expected to diminish significantly in the years to come. Unless the government invests more in research infrastructure, Israel's universities will be ill-equipped and insufficiently funded to meet the challenges of the 21st century.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Expanding access to higher education ===\nIsrael has offered virtually universal access to its universities and academic colleges since the wave of Jewish immigration from the former Soviet Union in the 1990s prompted the establishment of numerous tertiary institutions to absorb the additional demand. However, the Arab and ultra-orthodox minorities still attend university in insufficient numbers. The ''Sixth Higher Education Plan'' places emphasis on encouraging minority groups to enroll in higher education. Two years after the ''Mahar'' program was implemented in late 2012 for the ultra-orthodox population, student enrollment had grown by 1400. Twelve new programs for ultra-orthodox students have since been established, three of them on university campuses. Meanwhile, the Pluralism and Equal Opportunity in Higher Education program addresses the barriers to integration of the Arab minority in the higher education system. Its scope ranges from providing secondary-school guidance through preparation for academic studies to offering students comprehensive support in their first year of study, a stage normally characterized by a high drop-out rate. The program renews the ''Ma\u2019of'' fund supporting outstanding young Arab faculty members. Since the introduction of this program in 1995, the ''Ma\u2019of'' fund has opened tenure track opportunities for nearly 100 Arab lecturers, who act as role models for younger Arab students embarking on their own academic careers.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Science, technology and innovation policy ==\n\n=== Policy framework ===\nAlthough Israel does not have an \u2018umbrella type\u2019 policy for science, technology and innovation optimizing priorities and allocating resources, it does implement, ''de facto'', an undeclared set of best practices combining bottom-up and top-down processes via government offices, such as those of the Chief Scientist or the Minister of Science, Technology and Space, as well as ad hoc organizations like the Telem forum. The procedure for selecting research projects for the Israeli centers for research excellence is one example of this bottom-up process.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIsrael has no specific legislation regulating the transfer of knowledge from the academic sector to the general public and industry. Nevertheless, the Israeli government influences policy formulation by universities and technology transfer by providing incentives and subsidies through programmes such as Magnet and Magneton, as well as through regulation. There were attempts in 2004 and 2005 to introduce bills encouraging the transfer of knowledge and technology for the public benefit but, as these attempts failed, each university has since defined its own policy.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe Israeli economy is driven by industries based on electronics, computers and communication technologies, the result of over 50 years of investment in the country's defence infrastructure. Israeli defence industries have traditionally focused on electronics, avionics and related systems. The development of these systems has given Israeli high-tech industries a qualitative edge in civilian spin-offs in the software, communications and Internet sectors. However, the next waves of high technologies are expected to emanate from other disciplines, including molecular biology, biotechnology and pharmaceuticals, nanotechnology, material sciences and chemistry, in intimate synergy with information and communication technologies. These disciplines are rooted in the basic research laboratories of universities rather than the defence industries. This poses a dilemma. In the absence of a national policy for universities, let alone for the higher education system as a whole, it is not clear how these institutions will manage to supply the knowledge, skills and human resources needed for these new science-based industries.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Evaluation of science policy instruments ===\nThe country's various policy instruments are evaluated by the Council for Higher Education, the National Council for Research and Development, the Office of the Chief Scientist, the Academy of Sciences and Humanities and the Ministry of Finance. In recent years, the Magnet administration in the Office of the Chief Scientist has initiated several evaluations of its own policy instruments, most of which have been carried out by independent research institutions. One such evaluation was carried out in 2010 by the Samuel Neaman Institute; it concerned the Nofar programme within the Magnet directorate. Nofar tries to bridge basic and applied research, before the commercial potential of a project has caught the eye of industry. The main recommendation was for Nofar to extend programme funding to emerging technological domains beyond biotechnology and nanotechnology. The Office of the Chief Scientist accepted this recommendation and, consequently, decided to fund projects in the fields of medical devices, water and energy technology and multidisciplinary research.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAn additional evaluation was carried out in 2008 by Applied Economics, an economic and management research-based consultancy, on the contribution of the high-tech sector to economic productivity in Israel. It found that the output per worker in companies that received support from the Office of the Chief Scientist was 19% higher than in \u2018twin\u2019 companies that had not received this support. The same year, a committee headed by Israel Makov examined the Office of the Chief Scientist's support for research and development in large companies. The committee found economic justification for providing incentives for these companies.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===  Research funding programmes ===\nThe Israeli Science Foundation is the main source of research funding in Israel and receives administrative support from the Academy of Sciences and Humanities. The foundation provides competitive grants in three areas: exact sciences and technology; life sciences and medicine; and humanities and social sciences. Complementary funding is provided by binational foundations, such as the [[USA\u2013Israel Binational Science Foundation]] (est. 1972) and the [[German\u2013Israeli Foundation for Scientific Research and Development]] (est. 1986).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe Ministry of Science, Technology and Space funds thematic research centres and is responsible for international scientific co-operation. The Ministry's National Infrastructure Programme aims to create a critical mass of knowledge in national priority fields and to nurture the younger generation of scientists. Investment in the programme mainly takes the form of research grants, scholarships and knowledge centres. Over 80% of the ministry's budget is channelled towards research in academic institutions and research institutes, as well as towards revamping scientific infrastructure by upgrading existing research facilities and establishing new ones. In 2012, the ministry resolved to invest NIS 120 million over three years in four designated priority areas for research: brain science; supercomputing and cybersecurity; oceanography; and alternative transportation fuels. An expert panel headed by the Chief Scientist in the Ministry of Science, Technology and Space chose these four broad disciplines in the belief that they would be likely to exert the greatest practical impact on Israeli life in the near future.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe main ongoing programmes managed by the Office of the Chief Scientist within the Ministry of the Economy are: the Research and Development Fund; Magnet Tracks (est. 1994; Tnufa (est. 2001) and the Incubator Programme (est.1991). Between 2010 and 2014, the Office of the Chief Scientist initiated several new programmes:<ref name=\":0\" />\n* Grand Challenges Israel (since 2014): an Israeli contribution to the Grand Challenges in Global Health programme, which is dedicated to tackling global health and food security challenges in developing countries; Grand Challenges Israel is offering grants of up to NIS 500 000 at the proof of concept/feasibility study stage.\n* Research and development in the field of space technology (2012): encourages research to find technological solutions in various fields.\n* Technological Entrepreneurship Incubators (2014): encourages entrepreneurial technology and supports start-up technology companies.\n* Magnet \u2013 Kamin programme (2014) provides direct support for applied research in academia that has potential for commercial application.\n* Cyber \u2013 Kidma programme (2014): promotes Israel's cybersecurity industry.\n* Cleantech \u2013 Renewable Energy Technology Centre (2012): supports research through projects involving private\u2013public partnerships in the field of renewable energy.\n* Life Sciences Fund (2010): finances the projects of Israeli companies, with emphasis on biopharmaceuticals, established together with the Ministry of Finance and the private sector.\n* Biotechnology \u2013 Tzatam programme (2011): provides equipment to support research and development in life sciences. The Chief Scientist supports industrial organizations and the PBC provides research institutions with assistance.\n* Investment in high-tech industries (2011): encourages financial institutions to invest in knowledge-based industries, through a collaboration between the Office of the Chief Scientist and the Ministry of Finance.\nAnother source of public research funding is the Forum for National Research and Development Infrastructure (Telem). This voluntary partnership involves the Office of the Chief Scientist of the Ministry of the Economy and the Ministry of Science, Technology and Space, the Planning and Budgeting Committee and the Ministry of Finance. Telem projects focus on establishing infrastructure for research and development in areas that are of common interest to most Telem partners. These projects are financed by the Telem members\u2019 own resources.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Trends in research funding ===\nIn 2014, Israel topped the world for research &nbsp;intensity, reflecting the importance of research and innovation for the economy. Since 2008, however, Israel's research intensity has weakened somewhat (4.21% of GDP in 2013), even as this ratio has experienced impressive growth in the Republic of Korea (4.15% in 2014), Denmark (3.06% in 2013) and Germany (2.94% in 2013). The OECD average was 2.40% of GDP in 2014. Business expenditure on research and development (BERD) continues to account for ~84% of GERD, or 3.49% of GDP.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe share of higher education in gross domestic expenditure on research and development (GERD) has decreased since 2003 from 0.69% of GDP to 0.59% of GDP (2013). Despite this drop, Israel ranks 8th among OECD countries for this indicator. The lion's share of GERD (45.6%) in Israel is financed by foreign companies, reflecting the large scale of activity by foreign multinational companies and research centres in the country.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe share of foreign funding in university-performed research is also quite significant (21.8%). By the end of 2014, Israel had received \u20ac875.6 million from the European Union's (EU's) Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2007\u20132013), 70% of which had gone to universities. Its successor, [[Horizon 2020]] (2014\u20132020), has been endowed with nearly \u20ac80 billion in funding, making it the EU's most ambitious research and innovation programme ever. As of February 2015, Israel had received \u20ac119.8 million from the Horizon 2020 programme.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 2013, more than half (51.5%) of government spending was allocated to university research and an additional 29.9% to the development of industrial technologies. Research expenditure on health and the environment has doubled in absolute terms in the past decade but still accounts for less than 1% of total government GERD. Israel is unique among OECD countries in its distribution of government support by objective. Israel ranks at the bottom in government support of research in health care, environmental quality and infrastructure development.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThere has been insufficient government funding for universities in recent years. University research in Israel is largely grounded in basic research, even though it also engages in applied research and partnerships with industry. Basic research in Israel only accounted for 13% of research expenditure in 2013, compared to 16% in 2006. There has since been an increase in General University Funds and those destined for non-oriented research.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Trends in human resources ===\nIn 2012, there were 77 282 full-time equivalent researchers in Israel, 82% of whom had acquired an academic education, 10% of whom were practical engineers and technicians and 8% of whom held other qualifications. Eight out of ten (83.8%) were employed in the business sector, 1.1% in the government sector, 14.4% in the higher education sector and 0.7% in non-profit institutions.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 2011, 28% of senior academic staff were women, up by 5% over the previous decade (from 25% in 2005). Although the representation of women has increased, it remains very low in engineering (14%), physical sciences (11%), mathematics and computer sciences (10%) relative to education (52%) and paramedical occupations (63%).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThere is a visible ageing of scientists and engineers in some fields. For instance, about three-quarters of researchers in the physical sciences are over the age of 50 and the proportion is even higher for practical engineers and technicians. The shortage of professional staff will be a major handicap for the national innovation system in the coming years, as the growing demand for engineers and technical professionals begins to outpace supply.&nbsp;<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDuring the 2012/2013 academic year, 34% of bachelor's degrees were obtained in fields related to science and engineering in Israel. This compares well with the proportion in the Republic of Korea (40%) and most Western countries (about 30% on average). The proportion of Israeli graduates in scientific disciplines and engineering was slightly lower at the master's level (27%) but dominated at PhD level (56%).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nRecent statistics support the assertion that Israel may be living on the \u2018fruits of the past\u2019, that is to say, on the heavy investment made in primary, secondary and tertiary education during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. Between 2007 and 2013, the number of graduates in physical sciences, biological sciences and agriculture dropped, even though the total number of university graduates progressed by 19% (to 39 654). Recent data reveal that Israeli educational achievements in the core curricular subjects of mathematics and science are low in comparison to other OECD countries, as revealed by the exam results of Israeli 15-year olds in the OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment. Public spending on primary education has also fallen below the OECD average. The public education budget accounted for 6.9% of GDP in 2002 but only 5.6% in 2011. The share of this budget going to tertiary education has remained stable at 16\u201318% but, as a share of GDP, has passed under the bar of 1%. There is concern at the deteriorating quality of teachers at all levels of education and the lack of stringent demands on students to strive for excellence.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn recent years, Israel encountered the problem of shortage of specialists in the [[High tech|high-tech industry]].

Their orientation is based on  applied science and the dissemination of scientific knowledge to the general population. To date, seven centers are working with significant academic impact and relevance to the region.\n<br />\n\n== Scientific output ==\nThe number of Israeli publications stagnated between 2005 and 2014, according to Thomson Reuters' Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded). Consequently, the number of Israeli publications per million inhabitants also declined: between 2008 and 2013, it dropped from 1 488 to 1 431; this trend reflects a relative constancy in scholarly output in the face of relatively high population growth (1.1% in 2014) for a developed country and near-zero growth in the number of full-time equivalent researchers in universities. Between 2005 and 2014, Israeli scientific output was particularly high in life sciences. Israeli universities do particularly well in computer science but publications in this field tend to appear mostly in conference proceedings, which are not included in the Web of Science.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIsraeli publications have a high citation rate and a high share of papers count among the 10 percent most-cited. The share of papers with foreign co-authors is almost twice the OECD average, which is typical of small countries with a developed scientific and technological ecosystem. A team of 50 Israeli scientists work full-time at [[CERN]], the European Organization for Nuclear Research, which operates the [[Large Hadron Collider]] in Switzerland. Israel was granted observer status in 1991 before becoming a fully fledged member in 2014.

This evolution has been a corollary of the rise of the electronics industry and information technology services, along with a surge in the number of research personnel following the wave of immigration from the former Soviet Union.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIsrael has no specific legislation regulating the transfer of knowledge from the academic sector to the general public and industry.  There were attempts in 2004 and 2005 to introduce bills encouraging the transfer of knowledge and technology for the public benefit but, as these attempts failed, each university has since defined its own policy.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== University-industry collaboration ===\nAll Israeli research universities have technology transfer offices. Recent research conducted by the Samuel Neaman Institute has revealed that, between 2004 and 2013, the universities\u2019 share of patent applications constituted 10\u201312% of the total inventive activity of Israeli applicants. This is one of the highest shares in the world and is largely due to the intensive activity of the universities\u2019 technology transfer offices. The Weizmann Institute's technology transfer office, Yeda, has been ranked the third-most profitable in the world. Through exemplary university\u2013industry collaboration, the Weizmann Institute of Science and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries have discovered and developed the Copaxone drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Copaxone is Teva's biggest-selling drug, with US$1.68 billion in sales in the first half of 2011. Since the drug's approval by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1996, it is estimated that the Weizmann Institute of Science has earned nearly US$2 billion in royalties from the commercialization of its intellectual property.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== International technology transfer ===\nIn 2007, the [[United Nations]] General Assembly's [[United Nations General Assembly Second Committee|Economic and Financial Committee]] adopted an Israeli-sponsored draft resolution on agricultural technology transfer to developing countries. The resolution called on developed countries to make their knowledge and know-how accessible to the developing world as part of the UN campaign to eradicate hunger and dire poverty by 2015. The initiative is an outgrowth of Israel's many years of contributing its know-how to developing nations, especially Africa, in the spheres of agriculture, fighting desertification, rural development, irrigation, medical development, computers and the empowerment of women.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/PressRoom/2007/Pages/UN%20adopts%20Israeli-sponsored%20resolution%20on%20Agricultural%20Technology%20for%20Development%2011-Dec-2007.aspx|title=UN adopts Israeli-sponsored resolution on \"Agricultural Technology for Development\"|date=11 December 2007|publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs|access-date=15 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Venture capital ==\nAs new technology companies require money and [[seed capital]] to grow and thrive, Israel's science and technology sector is backed by a strong venture capital industry. Between 2004 and 2013, the Israeli venture capital industry played a fundamental role in funding the development of Israel's high-tech sector. In 2013, Israeli companies had raised more venture capital as a share of GDP than companies in any other country as it attracted US$2 346 million alone during that year. Today, Israel is considered one of the biggest venture capital centers in the world outside the United States of America. Several factors have contributed to this growth. These include tax exemptions on Israeli venture capital, funds established in conjunction with large international banks and financial companies and the involvement of major organizations desirous to capitalize on the strengths of Israeli high-tech companies. These organizations include some of the world's largest multinational technology companies, including [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Cisco Systems|Cisco]], [[Google]], [[IBM]], [[Intel]], [[Microsoft]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[Siemens]] and [[Samsung]]. In recent years, the share of venture capital invested in the growth stages of enterprises has flourished at the expense of early stage investments.<ref name=\":0\" /> Nowadays, Israeli companies are considered to be more popular than their American peers. For comparison, investments volume in Israeli startups grew by 140% during 2014-2018 and investments in technological startups from the U.S. grew by 64%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://8allocate.com/article/through-the-thorns-to-the-stars-israeli-startups-ecosystem-2019/|title=Through the Thorns to the Stars: Israeli Startups Ecosystem 2019|date=2019-07-08|website=8allocate|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Start-Up Nation Central's Annual Ecosystem 2019 Report|url=https://lp.startupnationcentral.org/annualreport/|journal=Start-Up Nation Central|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n== Intellectual property rights ==\nIntellectual property rights in Israel protect copyright and performers\u2019 rights, trademarks, geographical indicators, patents, industrial designs, topographies of integrated circuits, plant breeds and undisclosed business secrets. Both contemporary Israeli legislation and case law are influenced by laws and practices in modern countries, particularly Anglo-American law, the emerging body of EU law and proposals by international organizations.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIsrael has made a concerted effort to improve the economy's ability to benefit from an enhanced system of intellectual property rights. This includes increasing the resources of the Israel Patent Office, upgrading enforcement activities and implementing programmes to bring ideas funded by government research to the market. Between 2002 and 2012, foreigners accounted for nearly 80% of the patent applications filed with the Israel Patent Office. A sizeable{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=May 2017}} share of foreign applicants seeking protection from the Israel Patent Office are pharmaceutical companies such as F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Janssen, Novartis, Merck, Bayer-Schering, Sanofi-Aventis and Pfizer, which happen to be the main business competitors of Israel's own Teva Pharmaceutical Industries.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIsrael ranks tenth in the world for the number of patent applications filed with the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) by country of residence of the first-named inventor. Israeli inventors file far more applications with USPTO (5 436 in 2011) than with the [[European Patent Office]] (EPO). Moreover, the number of Israeli filings with EPO dropped from 1400 to 1063 between 2006 and 2011. This preference for USPTO is largely because foreign research centres implanted in Israel are primarily owned by US firms such as [[IBM]], Intel, Sandisk, Microsoft, Applied Materials, Qualcomm, Motorola, Google or Hewlett\u2013Packard. The inventions of these companies are attributed to Israel as the inventor of the patent but not as the owner (applicant or assignee). The loss of intellectual property into the hands of multinationals occurs mainly through the recruitment of the best Israeli talent by the local research centres of multinational firms. Although the Israeli economy benefits from the activity of the multinationals\u2019 subsidiaries through job creation and other means, the advantages are relatively small compared to the potential economic gains that might have been achieved, had this intellectual property been utilized to support and foster the expansion of mature Israeli companies of a considerable size.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Applied science and engineering ==\n\n=== Energy ===\n\n==== Solar power ====\n{{Further|Solar power in Israel}}\n[[File:Solar dish at Ben-Gurion National Solar Energy Center in Israel.jpg|thumb|The world's largest solar parabolic dish at the [[Ben-Gurion National Solar Energy Center]]<ref name=Register>{{cite news |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/01/25/faiman_negev_solar_plan/ |title=Giant solar plants in Negev could power Israel's future |first=John |last=Lettice |newspaper=The Register |date=25 January 2008}}</ref>|alt=A horizontal parabolic dish, with a triangular structure on its top.]]\nAs of 2014, Israel leads the 2014 Global Cleantech Innovation Index.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cleantechinnvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Cleantech-Innovation-Index-2014.pdf|title=The Global Cleantech Innovation Index 2014|author=|date=|website=CleanTechInnvest.com|access-date=16 May 2017}}</ref>\nThe country's lack of conventional energy sources has spurred extensive research and development of alternative energy sources and Israel has developed innovative technologies in the [[Solar power in Israel|solar energy field]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Seven solar technologies from Israel that could change our planet |first=Karin |last=Kloosterman |url=http://israel21c.org/environment/seven-solar-technologies-from-israel-that-could-change-our-planet/ |newspaper=ISRAEL21c |date=27 October 2009 |access-date=14 October 2012}}</ref> Israel has become the world's largest per capita user of solar water heaters in the home.

GTEP is presently the only center in Israel offering graduate studies in energy science and technology to bring the energy skills and know-how to address the energy challenges of the future.\n\n==== Natural gas ====\nSince 1999, large reserves of natural gas have been discovered off Israel's coast. This fossil fuel has become the primary fuel for electricity generation in Israel and is gradually replacing oil and coal. &nbsp;In 2010, 37% of electricity in Israel was generated from natural gas, leading to savings of US$1.4 billion for the economy. In 2015, this rate is expected to surpass 55%.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=Israel.

This is giving companies a competitive advantage by reducing their energy costs and lowering national emissions. Since early 2013, almost the entire natural gas consumption of Israel has been supplied by the Tamar field, an Israeli\u2013American private partnership. The estimated reserves amount to about 1 000 BCM, securing Israel's energy needs for many decades to come and making Israel a potentially major regional exporter of natural gas. In 2014, initial export agreements were signed with the Palestinian Authority, Jordan and Egypt; there are also plans to export natural gas to Turkey and the EU via Greece.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 2011, the government asked the Academy of Sciences and Humanities to convene a panel of experts to consider the full range of implications of the most recent discoveries of natural gas.

Those with cat allergies may react worse to direct contact with Sphynx cats than other breeds; even though reports exist that some people with allergies successfully tolerate Sphynx cats, they are fewer than those who have allergic reactions, according to David Rosenstreich, MD, the director of the Division of Allergy and Immunology at the [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]] and [[Montefiore Medical Center]] in the [[Bronx]], New York City, New York.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.ankhamun.com/Hypoallergenic%20cats.htm |url-status= dead| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110718192703/http://www.ankhamun.com/Hypoallergenic%20cats.htm| archivedate= July 18, 2011 |title= The Big Question, What about allergies? |website= Ankhamun.com |accessdate= February 9, 2017}}</ref> These positive reports may be cases of [[Allergy to cats#Desensitizing|desensitizing]], wherein the \"hairless\" cat gave the owner optimism to try to own a cat, eventually leading to the positive situation of their own adaptation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nSphynx cats can also have more ear wax than most hairy domestic cats because they have little to no hair in their ears.

Windows 10 also introduced the [[Microsoft Edge]] [[web browser]], a [[virtual desktop]] system, a window and desktop management feature called [[Task View]], support for [[Fingerprint recognition|fingerprint]] and [[face recognition]] login, new security features for enterprise environments, and [[DirectX 12]].\n\nWindows 10 received mostly positive reviews upon its original release in July 2015. Critics praised Microsoft's decision to provide a desktop-oriented interface in line with previous versions of Windows, contrasting the tablet-oriented approach of 8, although Windows 10's touch-oriented user interface mode was criticized for containing regressions upon the touch-oriented interface of Windows 8. Critics also praised the improvements to Windows 10's bundled software over Windows 8.1, [[Xbox Live]] integration, as well as the functionality and capabilities of the [[Cortana]] personal assistant and the replacement of [[Internet Explorer]] with Edge. However, media outlets have been critical of changes to operating system behaviors, including mandatory [[Windows Update|update]] installation, [[digital privacy|privacy]] concerns over data collection performed by the OS for Microsoft and its partners and the [[adware]]-like tactics used to promote the operating system on its release.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/3073457/how-microsofts-nasty-new-windows-10-pop-up-tricks-you-into-upgrading.html|title=How Microsoft's tricky new Windows 10 pop-up deceives you into upgrading|last=Chacos|first=Brad|date=May 22, 2016|work=[[PC World]]|publisher=[[IDG]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=May 14, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Microsoft's goal to have Windows 10 installed on over a billion devices within three years of its release failed<ref name=zdnet-onebillion/> (though it managed to reach the goal almost 5 years later),<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21116762/microsoft-windows-10-active-devices-billion-7-support |title = Microsoft hits its goal of 1 billion devices running Windows 10|date = March 16, 2020}}</ref> {{as of|2020|04|alt=by April 2020}} an estimated 70.98% of traditional PCs running Windows are running Windows 10,<ref name =\"share\">{{Cite web|url=https://gs.statcounter.com/windows-version-market-share/desktop/worldwide/#monthly-201701-202001|title=Desktop Windows Version Market Share Worldwide|website=StatCounter Global Stats|language=en|access-date=April 2, 2020}}</ref> and thus 55% <!--54.72558% calculated from 70.98% x 77.1% \"Total percentage of Windows\" for desktop OS's multiplied by percentage of Windows 10 for Windows desktop OS.--> of all traditional PCs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/worldwide/#monthly-201701-202003|title=Desktop Operating System Market Share Worldwide|last=|first=|date=|website=StatCounter Global Stats|language=en|access-date=April 2, 2020}}</ref><ref name =\"share\"/> Across all platforms (PC, mobile, tablet and console), 35% <!--34.96%--> of devices run some kind of Windows, Windows 10 or older.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share#monthly-201807-202003|title=Operating System Market Share Worldwide|website=StatCounter Global Stats|language=en|access-date=April 2, 2020}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Development ==\nAt the [[Microsoft Inspire|Microsoft Worldwide Partner Conference]] in 2011, Andrew Lees, the chief of Microsoft's mobile technologies, said that the company intended to have a single [[software ecosystem]] for PCs, phones, tablets, and other devices. \"We won't have an ecosystem for PCs, and one for phones, and one for tablets{{nsmdns}}they'll all come together.\"<ref name=\"UniversalOS\">{{cite web|url=https://blog.chron.com/techblog/2011/07/microsoft-envisions-a-universal-os-but-it-might-not-be-called-windows/|title=Microsoft envisions a universal OS, but it might not be called Windows|last=Silverman|first=Dwight|date=July 15, 2011|work=[[Houston Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|accessdate=May 14, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"SingleEcosystem\">{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2011/07/14/microsoft-one-ecosystem-pcs-tablets-phones-tvs-windows-brand-over |title=Microsoft says it will have a 'single ecosystem' for PCs, tablets, phones, and TVs... and is 'Windows' dead? |last=Patel |first=Nilay |date=July 14, 2011 |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |work=[[The Verge]] |accessdate=May 26, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2013, technology writer [[Mary Jo Foley]] reported that Microsoft was working on an update to Windows 8 codenamed \"Threshold\", after a planet in Microsoft's ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'' video game franchise.<ref name=zdnet-threshold /> Similarly to \"Blue\" (which became Windows 8.1),<ref name=\"pcw-whatisblue\">{{cite web | url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2027618/is-windows-blue-a-set-of-coordinated-updates-for-all-microsoft-products-.html | title=Is 'Windows Blue' a set of coordinated updates for all Microsoft products? | publisher=[[IDG]] | work=[[PC World]] | date=February 8, 2013 | last=Chacos | first=Brad | accessdate=April 7, 2015}}</ref> Foley called Threshold a \"wave of operating systems\" across multiple Microsoft platforms and services, scheduled for the second quarter of 2015.

By default, Windows requires a PIN to consist of four digits, but can be configured to permit more complex pins. However, a PIN is not a simpler [[password]]. While passwords are transmitted to [[domain controller]]s, PINs are not. They are tied to one device, and if compromised, only one device is affected. Backed by a [[Trusted Platform Module]] (TPM) chip, Windows uses PINs to create strong asymmetric key pairs. As such, the authentication token transmitted to the server is harder to crack. In addition, whereas weak passwords may be broken via [[rainbow table]]s, TPM causes the much-simpler Windows PINs to be resilient to [[brute-force attack]]s.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Halfin |first1=Dani |last2=Syfuhs |first2=Steve |title=Why a PIN is better than a password |url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-why-pin-is-better-than-password |website=Microsoft Docs |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=October 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nWhen Windows 10 was first introduced, multi-factor authentication was provided by two components: Windows Hello and Passport (not to be confused with [[Microsoft account|the Passport platform of 1998]]).

The level of compression used is dependent on a performance assessment performed during installations or by [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEMs]], which tests how much compression can be used without harming operating system performance. Furthermore, the Refresh and Reset functions use runtime system files instead, making a separate recovery partition redundant, allowing patches and updates to remain installed following the operation, and further reducing the amount of space required for Windows 10 by up to 12{{nbsp}}GB. These functions replace the [[Features new to Windows 8#Installation|WIMBoot mode]] introduced on Windows 8.1 Update, which allowed OEMs to configure low-capacity devices with flash-based storage to use Windows system files out of the compressed [[Windows Imaging Format|WIM image]] typically used for installation and recovery.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thurrott.com/windows/windows-10/2062/microsoft-explains-os-compression-in-windows-10 |title=Microsoft Explains OS Compression in Windows 10 |last1=Thurrot |first1=Paul |date=March 16, 2015 |website=Thurrot.com |publisher=[[WP:SPS|self-published]] |access-date=March 17, 2015}}{{better source|date=September 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-promises-drastic-cuts-in-disk-space-use-for-windows-10/|title=Microsoft promises drastic cuts in disk space use for Windows 10|last1=Bott|first1=Ed|authorlink=Ed Bott|date=March 16, 2015|website=ZDnet|publisher=CBS Interactive|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=March 17, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"winblog-compression\">{{cite web|url=https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2015/03/16/how-windows-10-achieves-its-compact-footprint/|title=How Windows 10 achieves its compact footprint|last=|first=|date=March 16, 2015|website=Windows Experience Blog|publisher=Microsoft|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=April 22, 2019}}</ref> Windows 10 also includes a function in its Settings app that allows users to view a breakdown of how their device's storage capacity is being used by different types of files, and determine whether certain types of files are saved to internal storage or an [[SD card]] by default.<ref name=techrepublic-storagesense>{{cite web |title= Leaked Windows 10 Build 9901 shows smarter Storage Sense |url= http://www.techrepublic.com/article/leaked-windows-10-build-9901-shows-smarter-storage-sense/ |first=Tony |last=Bradley|website=TechRepublic |date=December 17, 2014|accessdate=March 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Online services and functionality ===\nWindows 10 introduces a new default [[web browser]], [[Microsoft Edge]].

If Windows{{nbsp}}10 is reinstalled cleanly and there have not been any significant hardware changes since installation (such as a motherboard change), the online activation process will automatically recognize the system's digital entitlement if no product key is entered during installations. However, unique product keys are still distributed within retail copies of Windows{{nbsp}}10.

The Microsoft Edge web browser was praised for its performance, although it was not in a feature-complete state at launch. While considering them a \"great idea in principle\", concerns were shown for Microsoft's focus on the universal app ecosystem, noting that\n<blockquote>\nIt's by no means certain that developers are going to flock to Windows{{nbsp}}10 from [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] simply because they can convert their apps easily. It may well become a no-brainer for them, but at the moment a conscious decision is still required.<ref name=\"tr-review\">{{cite web|url=http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/software/operating-systems/windows-10-1267364/review/|title=Windows 10 Review|work=[[TechRadar]]|publisher=Future plc|accessdate=July 30, 2015}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n''[[Engadget]]'' was similarly positive, noting that the upgrade process was painless and that Windows{{nbsp}}10's user interface had balanced aspects of Windows{{nbsp}}8 with those of previous versions with a more mature aesthetic. Cortana's always-on [[voice detection]] was considered to be its \"true strength\", also citing its query capabilities and personalization features, but noting that it was not as pre-emptive as [[Google Now]]. Windows{{nbsp}}10's stock applications were praised for being improved over their Windows 8 counterparts, and for supporting windowed modes. The Xbox app was also praised for its Xbox One streaming functionality, although recommending its use over a wired network due to inconsistent quality over Wi-Fi. In conclusion, it was argued that \"Windows{{nbsp}}10 delivers the most refined desktop experience ever from Microsoft, and yet it's so much more than that. It's also a decent tablet OS, and it's ready for a world filled with hybrid devices. And, barring another baffling screwup, it looks like a significant step forward for mobile.

Microsoft Edge was praised for being \"tremendously promising\", and \"a much better browser than Internet Explorer ever was\", but criticized it for its lack of functionality on-launch. In conclusion, contrasting Windows{{nbsp}}8 as being a \"reliable\" platform albeit consisting of unfinished concepts, Windows{{nbsp}}10 was considered \"the best Windows yet\" and was praised for having a better overall concept in its ability to be \"comfortable and effective\" across a wide array of form factors, but that it was buggier than previous versions of Windows were on-launch.<ref name=ars-review>{{cite web|title=Review: Windows 10 is the best version yet\u2014once the bugs get fixed|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/07/review-windows-10-is-the-best-version-yet-once-the-bugs-get-fixed/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=July 31, 2015}}</ref> ''[[ExtremeTech]]'' felt that Windows{{nbsp}}10 restricted the choices of users, citing its more opaque setting menus, forcing users to give up bandwidth for the peer-to-peer distribution of updates, and for taking away user control of specific functions, such as updates, explaining that \"it feels, once again, as if Microsoft has taken the seed of a good idea, like providing users with security updates automatically, and shoved the throttle to maximum.\"<ref name=extremetech-privacysettings /> Windows 10 has also received criticism due to deleting files without user permission after auto updates.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.howtogeek.com/243581/windows-10-may-delete-your-programs-without-asking/|title=Windows 10 May Delete Your Programs Without Asking|date=Jan 4, 2018|last=Hoffman|first=Chris|website=How-To Geek|access-date=Feb 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\nCritics have noted that Windows{{nbsp}}10 heavily emphasizes [[freemium]] services, and contains various advertising facilities.

In particular, it was pointed out that Microsoft's internal testing departments had been prominently affected by a major round of layoffs undertaken by the company in 2014. Microsoft relies primarily on user testing and bug reports via the Windows Insider program (which may not always be of sufficient quality to identify a bug), as well as correspondence with OEMs and other stakeholders. In the wake of the known folder redirection data loss bug in the version 1809, it was pointed out that bug reports describing the issue had been present on the [[Feedback Hub]] app for several months prior to the public release. Following the incident, Microsoft updated Feedback Hub so that users may specify the severity of a particular bug report. When announcing the resumption of 1809's rollout, Microsoft stated that it planned to be more transparent in its handling of update quality in the future, through a series of blog posts that will detail its testing process and the planned development of a \"dashboard\" that will indicate the rollout progress of future updates.<ref>{{Cite

Universal apps can be designed to run across multiple Microsoft product families with nearly identical code{{nsmdns}}including [[Personal computer|PCs]], [[tablet computer|tablets]], [[smartphone]]s, [[embedded system]]s, [[Xbox One]], [[Surface Hub]] and [[Windows Mixed Reality|Mixed Reality]]. The Windows user interface was revised to handle transitions between a mouse-oriented interface and a [[touchscreen]]-optimized interface based on available input devices{{nsmdns}}particularly on [[2-in-1 PC]]s, both interfaces include an updated [[Start menu]] which incorporates elements of [[Windows 7]]'s traditional Start menu with the tiles of [[Windows 8]]. Windows 10 also introduced the [[Microsoft Edge]] [[web browser]], a [[virtual desktop]] system, a window and desktop management feature called [[Task View]], support for [[Fingerprint recognition|fingerprint]] and [[face recognition]] login, new security features for enterprise environments, and [[DirectX 12]].\n\nWindows 10 received mostly positive reviews upon its original release in July 2015. Critics praised Microsoft's decision to provide a desktop-oriented interface in line with previous versions of Windows, contrasting the tablet-oriented approach of 8, although Windows 10's touch-oriented user interface mode was criticized for containing regressions upon the touch-oriented interface of Windows 8. Critics also praised the improvements to Windows 10's bundled software over Windows 8.1, [[Xbox Live]] integration, as well as the functionality and capabilities of the [[Cortana]] personal assistant and the replacement of [[Internet Explorer]] with Edge. However, media outlets have been critical of changes to operating system behaviors, including mandatory [[Windows Update|update]] installation, [[digital privacy|privacy]] concerns over data collection performed by the OS for Microsoft and its partners and the [[adware]]-like tactics used to promote the operating system on its release.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/3073457/how-microsofts-nasty-new-windows-10-pop-up-tricks-you-into-upgrading.html|title=How Microsoft's tricky new Windows 10 pop-up deceives you into upgrading|last=Chacos|first=Brad|date=May 22, 2016|work=[[PC World]]|publisher=[[IDG]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=May 14, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Microsoft's goal to have Windows 10 installed on over a billion devices within three years of its release failed<ref name=zdnet-onebillion/> (though it managed to reach the goal almost 5 years later),<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21116762/microsoft-windows-10-active-devices-billion-7-support |title = Microsoft hits its goal of 1 billion devices running Windows 10|date = March 16, 2020}}</ref> {{as of|2020|04|alt=by April 2020}} it was estimated that 70.98% of all traditional PCs running Windows used that version,<ref name =\"share\">{{Cite web|url=https://gs.statcounter.com/windows-version-market-share/desktop/worldwide/#monthly-201701-202001|title=Desktop Windows Version Market Share Worldwide|website=StatCounter Global Stats|language=en|access-date=April 2, 2020}}</ref> and thus 55% <!--54.72558% calculated from 70.98% x 77.1% \"Total percentage of Windows\" for desktop OS's multiplied by percentage of Windows 10 for Windows desktop OS.--> of all traditional PCs were running Windows 10.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/worldwide/#monthly-201701-202003|title=Desktop Operating System Market Share Worldwide|last=|first=|date=|website=StatCounter Global Stats|language=en|access-date=April 2, 2020}}</ref><ref name =\"share\"/> Across all platforms (PC, mobile, tablet and console), 35% <!--34.96%--> of devices run some kind of Windows, Windows 10 or older.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share#monthly-201807-202003|title=Operating System Market Share Worldwide|website=StatCounter Global Stats|language=en|access-date=April 2, 2020}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Development ==\nAt the [[Microsoft Inspire|Microsoft Worldwide Partner Conference]] in 2011, Andrew Lees, the chief of Microsoft's mobile technologies, said that the company intended to have a single [[software ecosystem]] for PCs, phones, tablets, and other devices. \"We won't have an ecosystem for PCs, and one for phones, and one for tablets{{nsmdns}}they'll all come together.\"<ref name=\"UniversalOS\">{{cite web|url=https://blog.chron.com/techblog/2011/07/microsoft-envisions-a-universal-os-but-it-might-not-be-called-windows/|title=Microsoft envisions a universal OS, but it might not be called Windows|last=Silverman|first=Dwight|date=July 15, 2011|work=[[Houston Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|accessdate=May 14, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"SingleEcosystem\">{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2011/07/14/microsoft-one-ecosystem-pcs-tablets-phones-tvs-windows-brand-over |title=Microsoft says it will have a 'single ecosystem' for PCs, tablets, phones, and TVs... and is 'Windows' dead? |last=Patel |first=Nilay |date=July 14, 2011 |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |work=[[The Verge]] |accessdate=May 26, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2013, technology writer [[Mary Jo Foley]] reported that Microsoft was working on an update to Windows 8 codenamed \"Threshold\", after a planet in Microsoft's ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'' video game franchise.<ref name=zdnet-threshold /> Similarly to \"Blue\" (which became Windows 8.1),<ref name=\"pcw-whatisblue\">{{cite web | url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2027618/is-windows-blue-a-set-of-coordinated-updates-for-all-microsoft-products-.html | title=Is 'Windows Blue' a set of coordinated updates for all Microsoft products? | publisher=[[IDG]] | work=[[PC World]] | date=February 8, 2013 | last=Chacos | first=Brad | accessdate=April 7, 2015}}</ref> Foley called Threshold a \"wave of operating systems\" across multiple Microsoft platforms and services, scheduled for the second quarter of 2015.

By default, Windows requires a PIN to consist of four digits, but can be configured to permit more complex pins. However, a PIN is not a simpler [[password]]. While passwords are transmitted to [[domain controller]]s, PINs are not. They are tied to one device, and if compromised, only one device is affected. Backed by a [[Trusted Platform Module]] (TPM) chip, Windows uses PINs to create strong asymmetric key pairs. As such, the authentication token transmitted to the server is harder to crack. In addition, whereas weak passwords may be broken via [[rainbow table]]s, TPM causes the much-simpler Windows PINs to be resilient to [[brute-force attack]]s.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Halfin |first1=Dani |last2=Syfuhs |first2=Steve |title=Why a PIN is better than a password |url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-why-pin-is-better-than-password |website=Microsoft Docs |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=October 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nWhen Windows 10 was first introduced, multi-factor authentication was provided by two components: Windows Hello and Passport (not to be confused with [[Microsoft account|the Passport platform of 1998]]).

The system can reduce the storage footprint of Windows by approximately 1.5{{nbsp}}GB for [[32-bit]] systems and 2.6{{nbsp}}GB for [[64-bit computing|64-bit]] systems. The level of compression used is dependent on a performance assessment performed during installations or by [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEMs]], which tests how much compression can be used without harming operating system performance.

If Windows{{nbsp}}10 is reinstalled cleanly and there have not been any significant hardware changes since installation (such as a motherboard change), the online activation process will automatically recognize the system's digital entitlement if no product key is entered during installations. However, unique product keys are still distributed within retail copies of Windows{{nbsp}}10.

The Microsoft Edge web browser was praised for its performance, although it was not in a feature-complete state at launch. While considering them a \"great idea in principle\", concerns were shown for Microsoft's focus on the universal app ecosystem, noting that\n<blockquote>\nIt's by no means certain that developers are going to flock to Windows{{nbsp}}10 from [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] simply because they can convert their apps easily. It may well become a no-brainer for them, but at the moment a conscious decision is still required.<ref name=\"tr-review\">{{cite web|url=http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/software/operating-systems/windows-10-1267364/review/|title=Windows 10 Review|work=[[TechRadar]]|publisher=Future plc|accessdate=July 30, 2015}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n''[[Engadget]]'' was similarly positive, noting that the upgrade process was painless and that Windows{{nbsp}}10's user interface had balanced aspects of Windows{{nbsp}}8 with those of previous versions with a more mature aesthetic. Cortana's always-on [[voice detection]] was considered to be its \"true strength\", also citing its query capabilities and personalization features, but noting that it was not as pre-emptive as [[Google Now]]. Windows{{nbsp}}10's stock applications were praised for being improved over their Windows 8 counterparts, and for supporting windowed modes. The Xbox app was also praised for its Xbox One streaming functionality, although recommending its use over a wired network due to inconsistent quality over Wi-Fi. In conclusion, it was argued that \"Windows{{nbsp}}10 delivers the most refined desktop experience ever from Microsoft, and yet it's so much more than that. It's also a decent tablet OS, and it's ready for a world filled with hybrid devices. And, barring another baffling screwup, it looks like a significant step forward for mobile.

Microsoft Edge was praised for being \"tremendously promising\", and \"a much better browser than Internet Explorer ever was\", but criticized it for its lack of functionality on-launch. In conclusion, contrasting Windows{{nbsp}}8 as being a \"reliable\" platform albeit consisting of unfinished concepts, Windows{{nbsp}}10 was considered \"the best Windows yet\" and was praised for having a better overall concept in its ability to be \"comfortable and effective\" across a wide array of form factors, but that it was buggier than previous versions of Windows were on-launch.<ref name=ars-review>{{cite web|title=Review: Windows 10 is the best version yet\u2014once the bugs get fixed|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/07/review-windows-10-is-the-best-version-yet-once-the-bugs-get-fixed/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=July 31, 2015}}</ref> ''[[ExtremeTech]]'' felt that Windows{{nbsp}}10 restricted the choices of users, citing its more opaque setting menus, forcing users to give up bandwidth for the peer-to-peer distribution of updates, and for taking away user control of specific functions, such as updates, explaining that \"it feels, once again, as if Microsoft has taken the seed of a good idea, like providing users with security updates automatically, and shoved the throttle to maximum.\"<ref name=extremetech-privacysettings /> Windows 10 has also received criticism due to deleting files without user permission after auto updates.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.howtogeek.com/243581/windows-10-may-delete-your-programs-without-asking/|title=Windows 10 May Delete Your Programs Without Asking|date=Jan 4, 2018|last=Hoffman|first=Chris|website=How-To Geek|access-date=Feb 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\nCritics have noted that Windows{{nbsp}}10 heavily emphasizes [[freemium]] services, and contains various advertising facilities.

In particular, it was pointed out that Microsoft's internal testing departments had been prominently affected by a major round of layoffs undertaken by the company in 2014. Microsoft relies primarily on user testing and bug reports via the Windows Insider program (which may not always be of sufficient quality to identify a bug), as well as correspondence with OEMs and other stakeholders. In the wake of the known folder redirection data loss bug in the version 1809, it was pointed out that bug reports describing the issue had been present on the [[Feedback Hub]] app for several months prior to the public release. Following the incident, Microsoft updated Feedback Hub so that users may specify the severity of a particular bug report. When announcing the resumption of 1809's rollout, Microsoft stated that it planned to be more transparent in its handling of update quality in the future, through a series of blog posts that will detail its testing process and the planned development of a \"dashboard\" that will indicate the rollout progress of future updates.<ref>{{Cite

She served as Deputy Executive Director of ITC from June 2014 to January 2020.\n\nTembo served as the executive director of the [[Enhanced Integrated Framework]] from October 2008 until October 2013. She has also held several senior positions in the [[Government of Zambia]], notably as Chief Trade Negotiator and Director of Foreign Trade in the Ministry of Commerce, Trade and Industry of Zambia from 2004 until 2008.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nTembo was born in 1961 in [[Lusaka]], [[Zambia]]. She grew up in the Zambian capital with her six siblings, where her parents worked as educationalists. Tembo attended Roma Girls\u2019 Secondary School and proceeded to the [[University of Zambia]], where she obtained a Degree in Economics with African Development Studies. She has also completed a number of post graduate and skills building initiatives.\n\n== Career ==\nTembo joined the Zambian civil service in 1985 as an economist in the National Commission for Development Planning. In 1990 she joined Meridien Biao Bank where she was in charge of operations for one of its largest branches.\n\nIn 1995, Tembo returned to the public sector as a Senior Economist responsible for regional integration programmes in the Ministry of Commerce, Trade and Industry.\n\nFrom 2000 until 2003, Tembo served as Deputy Team Leader on a [[USAID]] RAPID project in [[Gaborone]], [[Botswana]], supporting member states of the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC) in the implementation of the SADC Trade Protocol.\n\nIn 2003 and 2004, Tembo served as a Trade and Investment Advisor on the USAID-funded Zambia Trade and Investment Enhancement Project (ZAMTIE) project in Lusaka, providing support to the Ministry of Commerce, Trade and Industry and the private sector.\n\nIn May 2004, the then President of the Republic of Zambia, [[Levy Mwanawasa]] appointed Tembo as Zambia\u2019s Chief Trade Negotiator and Director of Foreign Trade in the Ministry of Commerce, Trade and Industry. One of her key responsibilities during this period was to lead the Zambian technical team in its capacity as coordinator of the group of [[Least Developed Countries]] (LDCs) during the [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 2005]]. Among the agreements reached in Hong Kong was the decision to extend duty and quota-free market access to LDCs and the Aid-for-Trade agenda, an initiative that seeks to place a spotlight on the role of trade related capacity building in supporting growth and sustainable development with the aim of ensuring for poverty reduction. A key feature of this was the establishment of the [[Enhanced Integrated Framework]], a multi-donor initiative hosted by the WTO.\n\nTembo was in 2008 appointed to lead the Enhanced Integrated Framework by then WTO Director-General [[Pascal Lamy]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Enhanced Integrated Framework establishes an Executive Secretariat, welcomes Executive Director |url=https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/pres08_e/pr541_e.htm |website=WTO.org |publisher=World Trade Organization |accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref> During her tenure as Executive Director of the Enhanced Integrated Framework, from October 2008 to October 2013, Tembo spearheaded the establishment of the initiative (formerly the Integrated Framework), which sought to address the trade-related technical assistance needs and supply side constraints of the Least Developed Countries.\n\nTembo oversaw the effort of making the Enhanced Integrated Framework operational in 2010. By 30 April 2012, the initiative was supported by a multi-donor trust fund with paid-up capital of $165 million. During this period Tembo led the resource mobilisation and outreach efforts and managed the implementation of wide-ranging projects in the LDCs.\n\nIn June 2014, Tembo was appointed Deputy Executive Director of the [[International Trade Centre]]. During this period she led the operations of ITC, including oversight of project delivery, resource mobilisation and project and financial management.

As a [[sky deity]], she was the mother or consort of the sky god [[Horus]] and the [[sun god]] [[Ra]], both of whom were connected with kingship, and thus she was the symbolic mother of their earthly representatives, the [[pharaoh]]s. She was one of several goddesses who acted as the [[Eye of Ra]], Ra's feminine counterpart, and in this form she had a vengeful [[Aspect (religion)|aspect]] that protected her from her enemies. Her beneficent side represented music, dance, joy, love, sexuality and maternal care, and she acted as the consort of several male deities and the mother of their sons. These two aspects of the goddess exemplified the [[women in ancient Egypt|Egyptian conception]] of [[femininity]]. Hathor crossed boundaries between worlds, helping deceased [[ancient Egyptian conception of the soul|souls]] in the transition to the [[ancient Egyptian afterlife beliefs|afterlife]].\n\nHathor was often depicted as a [[Cattle in religion|cow]], symbolizing her maternal and celestial aspect, although her most common form was a woman wearing a headdress of cow horns and a sun disk. She could also be represented as a lioness, cobra, or [[Ficus sycomorus|sycamore tree]].\n\nCattle goddesses similar to Hathor were portrayed in [[art of ancient Egypt|Egyptian art]] in the fourth millennium BC, but she may not have appeared until the [[Old Kingdom]] (c. 2686\u20132181 BC). With the patronage of Old Kingdom rulers she became one of Egypt's most important deities. More [[Egyptian temple|temples]] were dedicated to her than to any other goddess; her most prominent temple was [[Dendera Temple complex|Dendera]] in [[Upper Egypt]]. She was also worshipped in the temples of her male consorts. The Egyptians connected her with foreign lands such as [[Nubia]] and [[Canaan]] and their valuable goods, such as [[incense]] and [[semiprecious]] stones, and some of the peoples in those lands adopted her worship. In [[Egypt]], she was one of the deities commonly invoked in private prayers and [[votive offerings]], particularly by women desiring children.\n\nDuring the [[New Kingdom]] (c. 1550\u20131070 BC), goddesses such as [[Mut]] and [[Isis]] encroached on Hathor's position in royal ideology, but she remained one of the most widely worshipped deities. After the end of the New Kingdom, Hathor was increasingly overshadowed by Isis, but she continued to be venerated until the [[decline of ancient Egyptian religion|extinction of ancient Egyptian religion]] in the early centuries AD.\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Narmer Palette, Egypt, c. 3100 BC - Royal Ontario Museum - DSC09726.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Stone slate carved with reliefs|Replica of the [[Narmer Palette]], c. 31st century BC. The face of a woman with the horns and ears of a cow, representing Hathor or [[Bat (goddess)|Bat]], appears twice at the top of the palette and in a row below the belt of the king.]]\n[[File:Narmer palette 83d40m hathor atop columns below belt of king.png|thumb|right|Detail on the Narmar Palette below the belt of the king shows Hathor atop four columns]]\nImages of [[Ancient Egyptian cattle|cattle]] appear frequently in the [[art of ancient Egypt|artwork]] of [[Predynastic Egypt]] (before c. 3100 BC), as do images of women with upraised, curved arms reminiscent of the shape of bovine horns. Both types of imagery may represent [[ancient Egyptian deities|goddesses]] connected with [[Cattle in religion|cattle]].{{sfn|Hassan|1992|p=15}} Cows are [[cattle in religion and mythology|venerated in many cultures]], including ancient Egypt, as symbols of motherhood and nourishment, because they care for their calves and supply humans of all ages with milk. The [[list of ancient Egyptian palettes#Gerzeh Palette|Gerzeh Palette]], a [[cosmetic palette|stone palette]] from the [[Naqada II]] period of prehistory (c. 3500\u20133200 BC), shows the silhouette of a cow's head with inward-curving horns surrounded by stars. The palette suggests that this cow was also linked with the sky, as were several goddesses from later times who were represented in this form: Hathor, [[Mehet-Weret]], and [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]].{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=15\u201317}}\n\nDespite these early precedents, Hathor is not unambiguously mentioned or depicted until the [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt|Fourth Dynasty]] (c. 2613\u20132494 BC) of the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]],{{sfn|Wilkinson|1999|pp=244\u2013245}} although several artifacts that refer to her may date to the [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|Early Dynastic Period]] (c. 3100\u20132686 BC).{{sfn|Gillam|1995|p=214}} When Hathor does clearly appear, her horns curve outward, rather than inward like those in Predynastic art.{{sfn|Fischer|1962|pp=11\u201313}}\n\nA bovine deity with inward-curving horns appears on the [[Narmer Palette]] from near the start of Egyptian history, both atop the palette and on the belt or apron of the king, [[Narmer]]. The Egyptologist Henry George Fischer suggested this deity may be [[Bat (goddess)|Bat]], a goddess who was later depicted with a woman's face and inward-curling horns, seemingly reflecting the curve of the cow horns.{{sfn|Fischer|1962|pp=11\u201313}} The Egyptologist Lana Troy, however, identifies a passage in the ''[[Pyramid Texts]]'' from the late Old Kingdom that connects Hathor with the \"apron\" of the king, reminiscent of the goddess on Narmer's garments, and suggests the goddess on the Narmer Palette is Hathor rather than Bat,{{sfn|Wilkinson|1999|pp=244\u2013245}}{{sfn|Troy|1986|p=54}} and the motif resembles the head of Hathor atop the columns of temples built throughout many dynasties. \n\nIn the Fourth Dynasty, Hathor rose rapidly to prominence.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=81\u201383}} She supplanted an early crocodile god who was worshipped at [[Dendera]] in [[Upper Egypt]] to become Dendera's patron deity, and she increasingly absorbed the cult of Bat in the neighboring region of [[Hu, Egypt|Hu]], so that in the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] (c. 2055\u20131650 BC) the two deities fused into one.{{sfn|Fischer|1962|pp=7, 14\u201315}} The theology surrounding the [[pharaoh]] in the Old Kingdom, unlike that of earlier times, focused heavily on the sun god [[Ra]] as [[king of the gods]] and father and patron of the earthly king. Hathor ascended with Ra and became his mythological wife, and thus divine mother of the pharaoh.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=81\u201383}}\n\n==Roles==\nHathor took many forms and appeared in a wide variety of roles.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=77, 145}} The Egyptologist Robyn Gillam suggests that these diverse forms emerged when the royal goddess promoted by the Old Kingdom court subsumed many local goddesses worshipped by the general populace, who were then treated as manifestations of her.{{sfn|Gillam|1995|pp=217\u2013218}} Egyptian texts often speak of the manifestations of the goddess as \"Seven Hathors\"{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=77, 145}} or, less commonly, of many more Hathors\u2014as many as 362.{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|pp=71\u201372}} For these reasons, Gillam calls her \"a type of deity rather than a single entity\".{{sfn|Gillam|1995|pp=217\u2013218}} Hathor's diversity reflects the diversity of traits that the Egyptians associated with goddesses. More than any other deity, she exemplifies the [[women in ancient Egypt|Egyptian perception]] of [[femininity]].{{sfn|Troy|1986|pp=53\u201354}}\n\n===Sky goddess===\nHathor was given the [[epithet]]s \"mistress of the sky\" and \"mistress of the stars\", and was said to dwell in the sky with Ra and other sun deities. Egyptians thought of the sky as a body of water through which the sun god sailed, and they connected it with the waters from which, according to their [[ancient Egyptian creation myths|creation myths]], the sun emerged at the beginning of time. This cosmic mother goddess was often represented as a cow. Hathor and Mehet-Weret were both thought of as the cow who birthed the sun god and placed him between her horns. Like Nut, Hathor was said to give birth to the sun god each dawn.{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|pp=31\u201334, 46\u201347}}\n\nHathor's [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] name was ''\u1e25wt-\u1e25rw''{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|p=130}} or ''\u1e25wt-\u1e25r''.{{sfn|Billing|2004|p=39}} It is typically translated \"house of Horus\" but can also be rendered as \"my house is the sky\".{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|pp=25, 48}} The falcon god [[Horus]] represented, among other things, the sun and sky. The \"house\" referred to may be the sky in which Horus lives, or the goddess's womb from which he, as a sun god, is born each day.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=140}}\n\n===Solar goddess===\n{{further|Eye of Ra}}\nHathor was a [[solar deity]], a feminine counterpart to sun gods such as Horus and Ra, and was a member of the divine entourage that accompanied Ra as he sailed through the sky in his [[barque#Barques and barque shrines in Ancient Egypt|barque]].{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=140}} She was commonly called the \"Golden One\", referring to the radiance of the sun, and texts from [[Dendera Temple complex|her temple at Dendera]] say \"her rays illuminate the whole earth.\"{{sfn|Richter|2016|pp=128, 184\u2013185}} She was sometimes fused with another goddess, [[Nebethetepet]], whose name can mean \"Lady of the Offering\", \"Lady of Contentment\",{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=156}} or \"Lady of the Vulva\".{{sfn|Pinch|1993|p=155}} At Ra's cult center of [[Heliopolis (ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]], Hathor-Nebethetepet was worshipped as his consort,{{sfn|Quirke|2001|pp=102\u2013105}} and the Egyptologist Rudolf Anthes argued that Hathor's name referred to a mythical \"house of Horus\" at Heliopolis that was connected with the ideology of kingship.{{sfn|Gillam|1995|p=218}}\n\nShe was one of many goddesses to take the role of the Eye of Ra, a feminine personification of the disk of the sun and an extension of Ra's own power. Ra was sometimes portrayed inside the disk, which Troy interprets as meaning that the Eye goddess was thought of as a womb from which the sun god was born. Hathor's seemingly contradictory roles as mother, wife, and daughter of Ra reflected the daily cycle of the sun. At sunset the god entered the body of the goddess, impregnating her and fathering the deities born from her womb at sunrise: himself and the Eye goddess, who would later give birth to him. Ra gave rise to his daughter, the Eye goddess, who in turn gave rise to him, her son, in a cycle of constant regeneration.{{sfn|Troy|1986|pp=21\u201323, 25\u201327}}\n\nThe Eye of Ra protected the sun god from his enemies and was often represented as a [[uraeus]], or rearing [[cobra]], or as a lioness.{{sfn|Pinch|2004|pp=129\u2013130}} A form of the Eye of Ra known as \"Hathor of the Four Faces\", represented by a set of four cobras, was said to face in each of the [[cardinal directions]] to watch for threats to the sun god.{{sfn|Ritner|1990|p=39}} A group of myths, known from the [[New Kingdom]] (c. 1550\u20131070 BC) onward, describe what happens when the Eye goddess rampages uncontrolled. In the [[ancient Egyptian funerary texts|funerary text]] known as the ''[[Book of the Heavenly Cow]]'', Ra sends Hathor as the Eye of Ra to punish humans for plotting rebellion against his rule. She becomes the lioness goddess [[Sekhmet]] and massacres the rebellious humans, but Ra decides to prevent her from killing all humanity. He orders that beer be dyed red and poured out over the land. The Eye goddess drinks the beer, mistaking it for blood, and in her inebriated state reverts to being the benign and beautiful Hathor.{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|pp=169\u2013170}} Related to this story is the myth of the Distant Goddess, from the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late]] and [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]] periods. The Eye goddess, sometimes in the form of Hathor, rebels against Ra's control and rampages freely in a foreign land: [[Ancient Libya|Libya]] west of Egypt or [[Nubia]] to the south. Weakened by the loss of his Eye, Ra sends another god, such as [[Thoth]], to bring her back to him.{{sfn|Pinch|2004|pp=71\u201374}} Once pacified, the goddess returns to become the consort of the sun god or of the god who brings her back.{{sfn|Pinch|2004|p=130}} The two aspects of the Eye goddess\u2014violent and dangerous versus beautiful and joyful\u2014reflected the Egyptian belief that women, as the Egyptologist Carolyn Graves-Brown puts it, \"encompassed both extreme passions of fury and love.\"{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|pp=169\u2013170}}\n\n===Music, dance, and joy===\n[[File:Funerary banquet of Nebamun.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|alt=Painting of elaborately dressed men and women. Some women clap and play flutes while others dance.|Banquet scene from the tomb chapel of [[Nebamun]], 14th century BC. Its imagery of music and dancing alludes to Hathor.{{sfn|Harrington|2016|pp=132\u2013134}}]]\nEgyptian religion celebrated the sensory pleasures of life, believed to be among the gods' gifts to humanity. Egyptians ate, drank, danced, and played music at their religious festivals. They perfumed the air with flowers and [[incense]]. Many of Hathor's epithets link her to celebration; she is called the mistress of music, dance, garlands, [[myrrh]], and drunkenness. In hymns and temple reliefs, musicians play tambourines, harps, lyres, and sistra in Hathor's honor.{{sfn|Finnestad|1999|pp=113\u2013115}} The [[sistrum]], a rattle-like instrument, was particularly important in Hathor's worship. Sistra had erotic connotations and, by extension, alluded to the creation of new life.{{sfn|Manniche|2010|pp=13\u201314, 16\u201317}}\n\nThese aspects of Hathor were linked with the myth of the Eye of Ra. The Eye was pacified by beer in the story of the Destruction of Mankind. In some versions of the Distant Goddess myth, the wandering Eye's wildness abated when she was appeased with products of civilization like music, dance, and wine. The water of the annual [[inundation of the Nile]], colored red by sediment, was likened to wine, and to the red-dyed beer in the Destruction of Mankind. Festivals during the inundation therefore incorporated drink, music, and dance as a way to appease the returning goddess.{{sfn|Poo|2009|pp=153\u2013157}} A text from the [[Temple of Edfu]] says of Hathor, \"the gods play the sistrum for her, the goddesses dance for her to dispel her bad temper.\"{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|p=57}} A hymn to the goddess [[Raet-Tawy]] as a form of Hathor at the temple of [[Medamud]] describes the [[Festival of Drunkenness]] as part of her mythic return to Egypt.{{sfn|Darnell|1995|p=48}} Women carry bouquets of flowers, drunken revelers play drums, and people and animals from foreign lands dance for her as she enters the temple's festival booth. The noise of the celebration drives away hostile powers and ensures the goddess will remain in her joyful form as she awaits the male god of the temple, her mythological consort [[Montu]], whose son she will bear.{{sfn|Darnell|1995|pp=54, 62, 91\u201394}}\n\n===Sexuality, beauty, and love===\nHathor's joyful, ecstatic side indicates her feminine, procreative power. In some creation myths she helped produce the world itself.{{sfn|Pinch|2004|p=138}} [[Atum]], a creator god who contained all things within himself, was said to have produced his children [[Shu (Egyptian god)|Shu]] and [[Tefnut]], and thus begun the process of creation, by masturbating. The hand he used for this act, the Hand of Atum, represented the female aspect of himself and could be personified by Hathor, Nebethetepet, or another goddess, [[Iusaaset]].{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=99, 141, 156}} In a late creation myth from the [[Ptolemaic Period]] (332\u201330 BC), the god [[Khonsu]] is put in a central role, and Hathor is the goddess with whom Khonsu mates to enable creation.{{sfn|Cruz-Uribe|1994|pp=185, 187\u2013188}}\n\nHathor could be the consort of many male gods, of whom Ra was only the most prominent. [[Mut]] was the usual consort of [[Amun]], the preeminent deity during the New Kingdom who was often linked with Ra. But Mut was rarely portrayed alongside Amun in contexts related to sex or fertility, and in those circumstances, Hathor or [[Isis]] stood at his side instead.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=155}} In the late periods of Egyptian history, the form of Hathor from Dendera and the form of Horus from Edfu were considered husband and wife{{sfn|Lesko|1999|p=127}} and in different versions of the myth of the Distant Goddess, Hathor-Raettawy was the consort of Montu{{sfn|Darnell|1995|pp=47, 69}} and Hathor-Tefnut the consort of Shu.{{sfn|Pinch|2004|p=197}}\n\nHathor's sexual side was seen in some [[Ancient Egyptian literature#Narrative tales and stories|short stories]]. In a cryptic fragment of a Middle Kingdom story, known as \"The Tale of the Herdsman\", a herdsman encounters a hairy, animal-like goddess in a marsh and reacts with terror. On another day he encounters her as a nude, alluring woman. Most [[Egyptologists]] who study this story think this woman is Hathor or a goddess like her, one who can be wild and dangerous or benign and erotic. Thomas Schneider interprets the text as implying that between his two encounters with the goddess the herdsman has done something to pacify her.{{sfn|Schneider|2007|pp=315\u2013317}} In \"[[The Contendings of Horus and Set]]\", a New Kingdom short story about the [[Osiris myth#Conflict of Horus and Set|dispute between those two gods]], Ra is upset after being insulted by another god, [[Babi (mythology)|Babi]], and lies on his back alone. After some time, Hathor exposes her genitals to Ra, making him laugh and get up again to perform his duties as ruler of the gods. Life and order were thought to be dependent on Ra's activity, and the story implies that Hathor averted the disastrous consequences of his idleness. Her act may have lifted Ra's spirits partly because it sexually aroused him, although why he laughed is not fully understood.{{sfn|Morris|2007|pp=198\u2013199, 201, 207}}\n\nHathor was praised for her beautiful hair. Egyptian literature contains allusions to a myth not clearly described in any surviving texts, in which Hathor lost a lock of hair that represented her sexual allure. One text compares this loss with Horus's loss of his [[Eye of Horus|divine Eye]] and [[Set (mythology)|Set]]'s loss of his testicles during the struggle between the two gods, implying that the loss of Hathor's lock was as catastrophic for her as the maiming of Horus and Set was for them.{{sfn|Selden|1998|pp=346\u2013348}}\n\nHathor was called \"mistress of love\", as an extension of her sexual aspect. In the series of love poems from Papyrus Chester Beatty I, from the [[Twentieth Dynasty]] (c. 1189\u20131077 BC), men and women ask Hathor to bring their lovers to them: \"I prayed to her [Hathor] and she heard my prayer. She destined my mistress [loved one] for me. And she came of her own free will to see me.\"{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|pp=40\u201341}}\n\n===Motherhood and queenship===\n[[File:Hatshepsut temple5.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Relief of a cow with a disk between her horns. A human wearing a crown drinks from her udders.|Hathor as a cow suckling [[Hatshepsut]], a female pharaoh, at Hatshepsut's [[temple of Hatshepsut|temple at Deir el-Bahari]], 15th century BC]]\nHathor was considered the mother of various child deities. As suggested by her name, she was often thought of as both Horus's mother and consort.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=82\u201383}} As both the king's wife and his heir's mother, Hathor was the mythic counterpart of human queens.{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|p=130}}\n\nIsis and Osiris were considered Horus's parents in the [[Osiris myth]] as far back as the late Old Kingdom, but the relationship between Horus and Hathor may be older still. If so, Horus only came to be linked with Isis and Osiris as the Osiris myth emerged during the Old Kingdom.{{sfn|Hart|2005|p=62}} Even after Isis was firmly established as Horus's mother, Hathor continued to appear in this role, especially when nursing the pharaoh. Images of the Hathor-cow with a child in a papyrus thicket represented his mythological upbringing in a secluded marsh. Goddesses' milk was a sign of divinity and royal status. Thus, images in which Hathor nurses the pharaoh represent his right to rule.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=175\u2013176}} Hathor's relationship with Horus gave a healing aspect to her character, as she was said to have restored Horus's missing eye or eyes after Set attacked him.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=140}} In the version of this episode in \"The Contendings of Horus and Set\", Hathor finds Horus with his eyes torn out and heals the wounds with gazelle's milk.{{sfn|Pinch|2004|pp=131\u2013132}}\n\nBeginning in the [[Late Period of Egypt|Late Period]] (664\u2013323 BC), temples focused on the worship of a divine family: an adult male deity, his wife, and their immature son. Satellite buildings, known as [[mammisis]], were built in celebration of the birth of the local child deity. The child god represented the cyclical renewal of the cosmos and an archetypal heir to the kingship.{{sfn|Meeks|Favard-Meeks|1996|pp=183\u2013184}} Hathor was the mother in many of these local triads of gods. At Dendera, the mature Horus of Edfu was the father and Hathor the mother, while their child was [[Ihy]], a god whose name meant \"sistrum-player\" and who personified the jubilation associated with the instrument.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=132\u2013133}} At [[Kom Ombo]], Hathor's local form, Tasenetnofret, was mother to Horus's son Panebtawy.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=123, 168}} Other children of Hathor included a minor deity from the town of Hu, named Neferhotep,{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=132\u2013133}} and several child forms of Horus.{{sfn|Hart|2005|p=71}}\n\nThe milky sap of the [[ficus sycomorus|sycamore tree]], which the Egyptians regarded as a symbol of life, became one of her symbols.{{sfn|Roberts|2000|pp=26\u201327}} The milk was equated with water of the Nile inundation and thus fertility.{{sfn|Richter|2016|pp=179\u2013182}} In the late Ptolemaic and [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman Periods]], many temples contained a creation myth that adapted long-standing ideas about creation.{{sfn|McClain|2011|pp=3\u20136}} The version from Hathor's temple at Dendera emphasizes that she, as a female solar deity, was the first being to emerge from the primordial waters that preceded creation, and her life-giving light and milk nourished all living things.{{sfn|Richter|2016|pp=169\u2013172, 185}}\n\nLike [[Meskhenet]], another goddess who presided over birth, Hathor was connected with ''[[shai]]'', the Egyptian concept of [[fate]], particularly when she took the form of the Seven Hathors. In two New Kingdom works of fiction, \"[[The Tale of Two Brothers]]\" and \"[[The Tale of the Doomed Prince]]\", the Hathors appear at the births of major characters and foretell the manner of their deaths.{{sfn|Hoffmeier|2001|pp=507\u2013508}}\n\nHathor's maternal aspects can be compared with those of Isis and Mut, yet there are many contrasts between them. Isis's devotion to her husband and care for their child represented a more socially acceptable form of love than Hathor's uninhibited sexuality,{{sfn|Griffiths|2001|p=189}} and Mut's character was more authoritative than sexual.{{sfn|te Velde|2001|p=455}} The text of the first century AD [[Papyrus Insinger]] likens a faithful wife, the mistress of a household, to Mut, while comparing Hathor to a strange woman who tempts a married man.{{sfn|te Velde|2001|p=455}}\n\n===Foreign lands and goods===\nEgypt maintained trade relations with the coastal cities of [[Syria (region)|Syria]] and [[Canaan]], particularly [[Byblos]], placing Egyptian religion in contact with the [[ancient Canaanite religion|religions of that region]].{{sfn|Hollis|2009|p=2}} At some point, perhaps as early as the Old Kingdom, the Egyptians began to refer to the patron goddess of Byblos, [[Baalat Gebal]], as a local form of Hathor.{{sfn|Espinel|2002|pp=117\u2013119}} So strong was Hathor's link to Byblos that texts from Dendera say she resided there.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=139}} The Egyptians sometimes equated [[Anat]], an aggressive Canaanite goddess who came to be worshipped in Egypt during the New Kingdom, with Hathor.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=137}} Some Canaanite artworks depict a nude goddess with a curling wig taken from Hathor's iconography.{{sfn|Cornelius|2004|p=45}} Which goddess these images represent is not known, but the Egyptians adopted her iconography and came to regard her as an independent deity, [[Qetesh]],{{sfn|Cornelius|2004|pp=96\u201397}} whom they associated with Hathor.{{sfn|Hart|2005|p=132}}\n\nHathor's solar character may have played a role in linking her with trade: she was believed to protect ships on the Nile and in the seas beyond Egypt, as she protected the barque of Ra in the sky.{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|pp=72\u201374}} The mythological wandering of the Eye goddess in Nubia or Libya gave her a connection with those lands as well.{{sfn|Darnell|1995|pp=93\u201394}}\n\nHathor was closely connected with the [[Sinai Peninsula]],{{sfn|Hart|2005|p=65}} which was not considered part of Egypt proper but was the site of Egyptian mines for copper, [[turquoise]], and [[malachite]] during the Middle and New Kingdoms.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|p=52}} One of Hathor's epithets, \"Lady of ''Mefkat''\", may have referred specifically to turquoise or to all blue-green minerals. She was also called \"Lady of [[Egyptian faience|Faience]]\", a blue-green ceramic that Egyptians likened to turquoise.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=49\u201350}}{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=143}} Hathor was also worshipped at various quarries and mining sites in Egypt's [[Eastern Desert]], such as the [[amethyst]] mines of Wadi el-Hudi, where she was sometimes called \"Lady of Amethyst\".{{sfn|Espinel|2005|pp=61, 65\u201366}}\n\nSouth of Egypt, Hathor's influence was thought to have extended over the [[land of Punt]], which lay along the Red Sea coast and was a major source for the incense with which Hathor was linked, as well as with Nubia, northwest of Punt.{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|pp=72\u201374}} The [[autobiography of Harkhuf]], an official in the [[Sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Sixth Dynasty]] (c. 2345\u20132181 BC), describes his expedition to a land in or near Nubia, from which he brought back great quantities of [[ebony]], panther skins, and incense for the king. The text describes these exotic goods as Hathor's gift to the pharaoh.{{sfn|Hart|2005|p=65}} Egyptian expeditions to mine gold in Nubia introduced her cult to the region during the Middle and New Kingdoms,{{sfn|Yellin|2012|pp=125\u2013128}} and New Kingdom pharaohs built several temples to her in the portions of Nubia that they ruled.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|pp=227\u2013230}}\n\n===Afterlife===\n[[Image:BD Hathor Mistress of the West.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Painting of a cow whose head protrudes from a hill, in front of which stand papyrus stalks and a pyramidal chapel|Hathor, in bovine form, emerges from a hill representing the [[Theban necropolis]], in a copy of the ''[[Book of the Dead]]'' from the 13th century BC]]\nHathor was one of several goddesses believed to assist deceased souls in the [[ancient Egyptian afterlife beliefs|afterlife]].{{sfn|Assmann|2005|p=153}} One of these was [[Imentet]], the goddess of the west, who personified the [[necropolises]], or clusters of tombs, on the west bank of the Nile, and the realm of the afterlife itself. She was often regarded as a specialized manifestation of Hathor.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=145\u2013146}}\n\nJust as she crossed the boundary between Egypt and foreign lands, Hathor passed through the boundary between the living and the [[Duat]], the realm of the dead.{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|p=166}} She helped the spirits of deceased humans enter the Duat and was closely linked with tomb sites, where that transition began.{{sfn|Meeks|Favard-Meeks|1996|pp=88, 164}} The [[Theban necropolis]], for example, was often portrayed as a stylized mountain with the cow of Hathor emerging from it.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=179\u2013180}} Her role as a sky goddess was also linked to the afterlife. Because the sky goddess\u2014either Nut or Hathor\u2014assisted Ra in his daily rebirth, she had an important part in [[Egyptian afterlife beliefs]], according to which deceased humans were reborn like the sun god.{{sfn|Vischak|2001|p=82}} Coffins, tombs, and the underworld itself were interpreted as the womb of this goddess, from which the deceased soul would be reborn.{{sfn|Assmann|2005|pp=170\u2013173}}{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=39\u201340, 110}}\n\nNut, Hathor, and Imentet could each, in different texts, lead the deceased into a place where they would receive food and drink for eternal sustenance. Thus, Hathor, as Imentet, often appears on tombs, welcoming the deceased person as her child into a blissful afterlife.{{sfn|Assmann|2005|pp=152\u2013154, 170\u2013173}} In New Kingdom funerary texts and artwork, the afterlife was often illustrated as a pleasant, fertile garden, over which Hathor sometimes presided.{{sfn|Billing|2004|pp=42\u201343}} The welcoming afterlife goddess was often portrayed as a goddess in the form of a tree, giving water to the deceased. Nut most commonly filled this role, but the tree goddess was sometimes called Hathor instead.{{sfn|Billing|2004|pp=37\u201338}}\n\nThe afterlife also had a sexual aspect. In the Osiris myth, the murdered god [[Osiris]] was resurrected when he copulated with Isis and conceived Horus. In solar ideology, Ra's union with the sky goddess allowed his own rebirth. Sex therefore enabled the rebirth of the deceased, and goddesses like Isis and Hathor served to rouse the deceased to new life. But they merely stimulated the male deities' regenerative powers, rather than playing the central role.{{sfn|Cooney|2010|pp=227\u2013229}}\n\nAncient Egyptians prefixed the names of the deceased with Osiris's name to connect them with his resurrection. For example, a woman named [[Henutmehyt]] would be dubbed \"Osiris-Henutmehyt\". Over time they increasingly associated the deceased with both male and female divine powers.{{sfn|Cooney|2010|pp=227\u2013229, 235\u2013236}} As early as the late Old Kingdom, women were sometimes said to join the worshippers of Hathor in the afterlife, just as men joined the following of Osiris. In the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt|Third Intermediate Period]] (c. 1070\u2013664 BC), Egyptians began to add Hathor's name to that of deceased women in place of that of Osiris. In some cases, women were called \"Osiris-Hathor\", indicating that they benefited from the revivifying power of both deities. In these late periods, Hathor was sometimes said to rule the afterlife as Osiris did.{{sfn|Smith|2017|pp=251\u2013254}}\n\n==Iconography==\nHathor was often depicted as a cow bearing the sun disk between her horns, especially when shown nursing the king. She could also appear as a woman with the head of a cow. Her most common form, however, was a woman wearing a headdress of the horns and sun disk, often with a red or turquoise sheath dress, or a dress combining both colors. Sometimes the horns stood atop a low [[modius (headdress)|modius]] or the vulture headdress that [[Egyptian queens]] often wore in the New Kingdom. Because Isis adopted the same headdress during the New Kingdom, the two goddesses can be distinguished only if labeled in writing. When in the role of Imentet, Hathor wore the [[emblem of the west]] upon her head instead of the horned headdress.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=143\u2013144, 148}} The Seven Hathors were sometimes portrayed as a set of seven cows, accompanied by a minor sky and afterlife deity called the Bull of the West.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=77, 175}}\n\nSome animals other than cattle could represent Hathor. The uraeus was a common motif in Egyptian art and could represent a variety of goddesses who were identified with the Eye of Ra.{{sfn|Pinch|2004|pp=198\u2013199}} When Hathor was depicted as a uraeus, it represented the ferocious and protective aspects of her character. She also appeared as a lioness, and this form had a similar meaning.{{sfn|Roberts|1997|pp=8\u201310}} In contrast, the [[domestic cat]], which was sometimes connected with Hathor, often represented the Eye goddess's pacified form.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=190\u2013197}} When portrayed as a sycamore tree, Hathor was usually shown with the upper body of her human form emerging from the trunk.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=168\u2013169}}\n\nLike other goddesses, Hathor might carry a stalk of papyrus as a staff, though she could instead hold a ''[[Was-sceptre|was]]'' staff, a symbol of power that was usually restricted to male deities.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=143}} The only goddesses who used the ''was'' were those, like Hathor, who were linked with the Eye of Ra.{{sfn|Graham|2001|p=166}} She also commonly carried a sistrum or a ''menat'' necklace. The sistrum came in two varieties: a simple loop shape or the more complex ''naos'' sistrum, which was shaped to resemble a ''[[Cella#Egyptian temples|naos]]'' shrine and flanked by [[volute]]s resembling the antennae of the Bat emblem.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=153\u2013159}} The ''[[menat]]'' necklace, made up of many strands of beads, was shaken in ceremonies in Hathor's honor, similarly to the sistrum.{{sfn|Hart|2005|p=65}} Images of it were sometimes seen as personifications of Hathor herself.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|p=278}} Mirrors were another of her symbols, because in Egypt they were often made of gold or bronze and therefore symbolized the sun disk, and because they were connected with beauty and femininity. Some mirror handles were made in the shape of Hathor's face.{{sfn|Wilkinson|1993|pp=32, 83}}\n\nHathor was sometimes represented as a human face with bovine ears, seen from the front rather than in the profile-based perspective that was typical of Egyptian art. When she appears in this form, the tresses on either side of her face often curl into loops. This mask-like face was placed on the [[capital (architecture)|capitals]] of columns beginning in the late Old Kingdom. Columns of this style were used in many temples to Hathor and other goddesses.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=135\u2013139}} These columns have two or four faces, which may represent the duality between different aspects of the goddess or the watchfulness of Hathor of the Four Faces. The designs of Hathoric columns have a complex relationship with those of sistra. Both styles of sistrum can bear the Hathor mask on the handle, and Hathoric columns often incorporate the ''naos'' sistrum shape above the goddess's head.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=153\u2013159}}\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"220px\">\nFile:Hathor Amulet MET DP136527.jpg|alt=Refer to caption|Amulet of Hathor as a [[uraeus]] wearing a ''naos'' headdress, early to mid-first millennium BC\nFile:Hathor's head.

Hathor was one of the few deities to receive such donations.{{sfn|Goedicke|1978|pp=118\u2013123}} Late Old Kingdom rulers especially promoted the cult of Hathor in the provinces, as a way of binding those regions to the royal court. She may have absorbed the traits of contemporary provincial goddesses.{{sfn|Morris|2011|pp=75\u201376}}\n\nMany female royals, though not reigning queens, held positions in the cult during the Old Kingdom.{{sfn|Gillam|1995|pp=222\u2013226, 231}} [[Mentuhotep II]], who became the first pharaoh of the Middle Kingdom despite having no relation to the Old Kingdom rulers, sought to legitimize his rule by portraying himself as Hathor's son. The first images of the Hathor-cow suckling the king date to his reign, and several priestesses of Hathor were depicted as though they were his wives, although he may not have actually married them.{{sfn|Gillam|1995|p=231}}{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|pp=135\u2013136}} In the course of the Middle Kingdom, queens were increasingly seen as directly embodying the goddess, just as the king embodied Ra.{{sfn|Gillam|1995|p=234}} The emphasis on the queen as Hathor continued through the New Kingdom. Queens were portrayed with the headdress of Hathor beginning in the late Eighteenth Dynasty. An image of the [[sed festival]] of [[Amenhotep III]], meant to celebrate and renew his rule, shows the king together with Hathor and his queen [[Tiye]], which could mean that the king symbolically married the goddess in the course of the festival.{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|pp=132\u2013133}}\n\n[[Hatshepsut]], a woman who ruled as a pharaoh in the early New Kingdom, emphasized her relationship to Hathor in a different way.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=105\u2013107}} She used [[ancient Egyptian royal titulary|names and titles]] that linked her to a variety of goddesses, including Hathor, so as to legitimize her rule in what was normally a male position.{{sfn|Robins|1999|pp=107\u2013112}} She built several temples to Hathor and placed her own [[Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut|mortuary temple]], which incorporated a chapel dedicated to the goddess, at [[Deir el-Bahari]], which had been a cult site of Hathor since the Middle Kingdom.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=105\u2013107}}\n\nThe preeminence of Amun during the New Kingdom gave greater visibility to his consort Mut, and in the course of the period, Isis began appearing in roles that traditionally belonged to Hathor alone, such as that of the goddess in the solar barque. Despite the growing prominence of these deities, Hathor remained important, particularly in relation to fertility, sexuality, and queenship, throughout the New Kingdom.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=119\u2013120, 178\u2013179}}\n\nAfter the New Kingdom, Isis increasingly overshadowed Hathor and other goddesses as she took on their characteristics.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|p=129}} In the [[Ptolemaic period]] (305\u201330 BC), when [[Greeks]] governed Egypt and [[Ancient Greek religion|their religion]] developed a complex relationship with that of Egypt, the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] adopted and modified the Egyptian ideology of kingship. Beginning with [[Arsinoe II]], wife of [[Ptolemy II]], the Ptolemies closely linked their queens with Isis and with several Greek goddesses, particularly their own goddess of love and sexuality, [[Aphrodite]].{{sfn|Selden|1998|pp=312, 339}} Nevertheless, when the Greeks referred to Egyptian gods by the names of their own gods (a practice called ''[[interpretatio Graeca]]''), they sometimes called Hathor Aphrodite.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=141}} Traits of Isis, Hathor, and Aphrodite were all combined to justify the treatment of Ptolemaic queens as goddesses. Thus, the poet [[Callimachus]] alluded to the myth of Hathor's lost lock of hair when praising [[Berenice II]] for sacrificing her own hair to Aphrodite,{{sfn|Selden|1998|pp=346\u2013348}} and iconographic traits that Isis and Hathor shared, such as the bovine horns and vulture headdress, appeared on images portraying Ptolemaic queens as Aphrodite.{{sfn|Cheshire|2007|pp=157\u2013163}}\n\n===Temples in Egypt===\n[[File:Dendera hypostyle hall crosswise.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Room with tall stone columns topped by faces of women.

During the New Kingdom era, the temple of Hathor of the Southern Sycomore was her main temple in Memphis.{{sfn|Gillam|1995|pp=219\u2013221}} At that site she was described as the daughter of the city's main deity, [[Ptah]].{{sfn|Vischak|2001|p=82}} The cult of Ra and Atum at Heliopolis, northeast of Memphis, included a temple to Hathor-Nebethetepet that was probably built in the Middle Kingdom. A willow and a sycomore tree stood near the sanctuary and may have been worshipped as manifestations of the goddess.{{sfn|Quirke|2001|pp=102\u2013105}} A few cities farther north in the [[Nile Delta]], such as [[Yamu]] and [[Terenuthis]], also had temples to her.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|pp=108, 111}}\n\nAs the rulers of the Old Kingdom made an effort to develop towns in Upper and [[Middle Egypt]], several cult centers of Hathor were founded across the region, at sites such as [[Cusae]], [[Akhmim]], and [[Naga ed-Der]].{{sfn|Gillam|1995|pp=226, 229}} In the [[First Intermediate Period]] (c. 2181\u20132055) her cult statue from Dendera was periodically carried to the Theban necropolis. During the beginning of the Middle Kingdom, Mentuhotep II established a permanent cult center for her in the necropolis at Deir el-Bahari.{{sfn|Goedicke|1991|pp=245, 252}} The nearby village of [[Deir el-Medina]], home to the tomb workers of the necropolis during the New Kingdom, also contained temples of Hathor. One continued to function and was periodically rebuilt as late as the Ptolemaic Period, centuries after the village was abandoned.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|pp=189\u2013190}}\n\nDendera, Hathor's oldest temple in Upper Egypt, dates to at least to the Fourth Dynasty.{{sfn|Gillam|1995|p=227}} After the end of the Old Kingdom it surpassed her Memphite temples in importance.{{sfn|Vischak|2001|p=83}} Many kings made additions to the temple complex through Egyptian history. The last version of the temple was built in the Ptolemaic and Roman Periods and is today one of the best-preserved Egyptian temples from that time.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|pp=149\u2013151}}\n\nIn the Old Kingdom, most priests of Hathor, including the highest ranks, were women. Many of these women were members of the royal family.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=240\u2013241}} In the course of the Middle Kingdom, women were increasingly excluded from the highest priestly positions, at the same time that queens were becoming more closely tied to Hathor's cult. Thus, non-royal women disappeared from the high ranks of Hathor's priesthood,{{sfn|Gillam|1995|pp=233\u2013234}} although women continued to serve as musicians and singers in temple cults across Egypt.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=243\u2013244}}\n\nThe most frequent temple rite for any deity was the daily offering ritual, in which the cult image, or statue, of a deity would be clothed and given food.{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=328}} The daily ritual was largely the same in every Egyptian temple,{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=328}} although the goods given as offerings could vary according to which deity received them.{{sfn|Meeks|Favard-Meeks|1996|pp=126\u2013128}} Wine and beer were common offerings in all temples, but especially in rituals in Hathor's honor,{{sfn|Poo|2010|pp=2\u20133}} and she and the goddesses related to her often received sistra and ''menat'' necklaces.{{sfn|Meeks|Favard-Meeks|1996|pp=126\u2013128}} In Late and Ptolemaic times, they were also offered a pair of mirrors, representing the sun and the moon.{{sfn|Derriks|2001|pp=421\u2013422}}\n\n===Festivals===\nMany of Hathor's annual festivals were celebrated with drinking and dancing that served a ritual purpose. Revelers at these festivals may have aimed to reach a state of [[religious ecstasy]], which was otherwise rare or nonexistent in ancient Egyptian religion. Graves-Brown suggests that celebrants in Hathor's festivals aimed to reach an [[altered state of consciousness]] to allow them interact with the divine realm.{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|pp=166\u2013169}} An example is the Festival of Drunkenness, commemorating the return of the Eye of Ra, which was celebrated on the twentieth day of the [[Thout|month of Thout]] at temples to Hathor and to other Eye goddesses. It was celebrated as early as the Middle Kingdom, but it is best known from Ptolemaic and Roman times.{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|pp=166\u2013169}} The dancing, eating and drinking that took place during the Festival of Drunkenness represented the opposite of the sorrow, hunger, and thirst that the Egyptians associated with death. Whereas the rampages of the Eye of Ra brought death to humans, the Festival of Drunkenness celebrated life, abundance, and joy.{{sfn|Frandsen|1999|pp=131, 142\u2013143}}\n\nIn a local Theban festival known as the [[Beautiful Festival of the Valley]], which began to be celebrated in the Middle Kingdom, the cult image of Amun from the [[Precinct of Amun-Re|Temple of Karnak]] visited the temples in the Theban Necropolis while members of the community went to the tombs of their deceased relatives to drink, eat, and celebrate.{{sfn|Teeter|2011|pp=67\u201368}} Hathor was not involved in this festival until the early New Kingdom,{{sfn|Sadek|1988|p=49}} after which Amun's overnight stay in the temples at Deir el-Bahari came to be seen as his sexual union with her.{{sfn|Teeter|2011|p=70}}\n\nSeveral temples in Ptolemaic times, including that of Dendera, observed the Egyptian new year with a series of ceremonies in which images of the temple deity were supposed to be revitalized by contact with the sun god. On the days leading up to the new year, Dendera's statue of Hathor was taken to the ''[[wabet]]'', a specialized room in the temple, and placed under a ceiling decorated with images of the sky and sun. On the first day of the new year, the first day of the [[Thoth (month)|month of Thoth]], the Hathor image was carried up to the roof to be bathed in genuine sunlight.{{sfn|Meeks|Favard-Meeks|1996|pp=193\u2013198}}\n\nThe best-documented festival focused on Hathor is another Ptolemaic celebration, the Festival of the Beautiful Reunion. It took place over fourteen days in the month of [[Epiphi]].{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|p=93}}{{sfn|Richter|2016|p=4}} Hathor's cult image from Dendera was carried by boat to several temple sites to visit the gods of those temples. The endpoint of the journey was the Temple of Horus at [[Edfu]], where the Hathor statue from Dendera met that of Horus of Edfu and the two were placed together.{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|p=94}} On one day of the festival, these images were carried out to a shrine where primordial deities such as the sun god and the [[Ennead]] were said to be buried. The texts say the divine couple performed offering rites for these entombed gods.{{sfn|Verner|2013|pp=437\u2013439}} Many Egyptologists regard this festival as a [[hieros gamos|ritual marriage]] between Horus and Hathor, although Martin Stadler challenges this view, arguing that it instead represented the rejuvenation of the buried creator gods.{{sfn|Stadler|2008|pp=4\u20136}} C. J. Bleeker thought the Beautiful Reunion was another celebration of the return of the Distant Goddess, citing allusions in the temple's festival texts to the myth of the solar eye.{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|pp=98\u2013101}} Barbara Richter argues that the festival represented all three things at once. She points out that the birth of Horus and Hathor's son Ihy was celebrated at Dendera nine months after the Festival of the Beautiful Reunion, implying that Hathor's visit to Horus represented Ihy's conception.{{sfn|Richter|2016|pp=4, 202\u2013205}}\n\nThe third month of the [[Egyptian calendar]], [[Hathor (month)|Hathor or Athyr]], was named for the goddess. Festivities in her honor took place throughout the month, although they are not recorded in the texts from Dendera.{{sfn|Verner|2013|p=43}}\n\n===Worship outside Egypt===\n[[File:Temple of Hathor in Timna Park in summer 2011 (1).JPG|thumb|upright|right|alt=Foundations of a small stone wall at the base of a desert cliff|Remains of the Hathor shrine in the [[Timna Valley]]]]\nEgyptian kings as early as the Old Kingdom donated goods to the temple of Baalat Gebal in Byblos, using the syncretism of Baalat with Hathor to cement their close trading relationship with Byblos.{{sfn|Espinel|2002|pp=116\u2013118}} A temple to Hathor as Lady of Byblos was built during the reign of [[Thutmose III]], although it may simply have been a shrine within the temple of Baalat.{{sfn|Traunecker|2001|p=110}} After the breakdown of the New Kingdom, Hathor's prominence in Byblos diminished along with Egypt's trade links to the city. A few artifacts from the early first millennium BC suggest that the Egyptians began equating Baalat with Isis at that time.{{sfn|Zernecke|2013|pp=227\u2013230}} A myth about Isis's presence in Byblos, related by the Greek author [[Plutarch]] in his work ''On Isis and Osiris'' in the 2nd century AD, suggests that by his time Isis had entirely supplanted Hathor in the city.{{sfn|Hollis|2009|pp=4\u20135}}\n\nEgyptians in the Sinai built a few temples in the region. The largest was a complex dedicated primarily to Hathor as patroness of mining at [[Serabit el-Khadim]], on the west side of the peninsula.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|pp=238\u2013239}} It was occupied from the middle of the Middle Kingdom to near the end of the New.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=55\u201357}} The [[Timna Valley]], on the fringes of the Egyptian empire on the east side of the peninsula, was the site of seasonal mining expeditions during the New Kingdom. It included a shrine to Hathor that was probably deserted during the off-season. The local [[Midianites]], whom the Egyptians used as part of the mining workforce, may have given offerings to Hathor as their overseers did. After the Egyptians abandoned the site in the Twentieth Dynasty, however, the Midianites converted the shrine to a tent shrine devoted to their own deities.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=59\u201369}}\n\nIn contrast, the Nubians in the south fully incorporated Hathor into their religion. During the New Kingdom, when most of Nubia was under Egyptian control, pharaohs dedicated several temples in Nubia to Hathor, such as those at [[Faras]] and [[Mirgissa]].{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|pp=227\u2013230}} Amenhotep III and [[Ramesses II]] both built temples in Nubia that celebrated their respective queens as manifestations of female deities, including Hathor: Amenhotep's wife Tiye at [[Sedeinga]]{{sfn|Morkot|2012|pp=325\u2013326}} and Ramesses's wife [[Nefertari]] at the [[Abu Simbel temples#Small Temple|Small Temple of Abu Simbel]].{{sfn|Fisher|2012|pp=357\u2013358}} The independent Kingdom of Kush, which emerged in Nubia after the collapse of the New Kingdom, based its beliefs about [[List of monarchs of Kush|Kushite kings]] on the royal ideology of Egypt. Therefore, Hathor, Isis, Mut, and Nut were all seen as the mythological mother of each Kushite king and equated with his female relatives, such as the ''[[kandake]]'', the Kushite queen or [[queen mother]], who had prominent roles in Kushite religion.{{sfn|Kendall|2010b}} At [[Jebel Barkal]], a site sacred to Amun, the Kushite king [[Taharqa]] built a pair of temples, one dedicated to Hathor and [[Temple of Mut, Jebel Barkal|one to Mut]] as consorts of Amun, replacing New Kingdom Egyptian temples that may have been dedicated to these same goddesses.{{sfn|Kendall|2010a|pp=1, 12}} But Isis was the most prominent of the Egyptian goddesses worshipped in Nubia, and her status there increased over time. Thus, in the Meroitic period of Nubian history (c. 300 BC \u2013 AD 400), Hathor appeared in temples mainly as a companion to Isis.{{sfn|Yellin|2012|pp=128, 133}}\n\n===Popular worship===\n[[File:Plaque of a woman giving birth assisted by Hathor.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Plaque showing a woman squatting while cow-headed women stand at either side|Ptolemaic plaque of a woman giving birth assisted by two figures of Hathor, fourth to first century BC]]\nIn addition to formal and public rituals at temples, Egyptians privately worshipped deities for personal reasons, including at their homes. Birth was hazardous for both mother and child in ancient Egypt, yet children were much desired. Thus fertility and safe childbirth are among the most prominent concerns in their popular religion, and fertility deities such as Hathor and [[Taweret]] were commonly worshipped in household shrines. Egyptian women squatted on bricks while giving birth, and the only known surviving birth brick from ancient Egypt is decorated with an image of a woman holding her child flanked by images of Hathor.{{sfn|Ritner|2008|pp=173\u2013175, 181}} In Roman times, [[terracotta]] figurines, sometimes found in a domestic context, depicted a woman with an elaborate headdress exposing her genitals, as Hathor did to cheer up Ra.{{sfn|Morris|2007|pp=218\u2013219}} The meaning of these figurines is not known,{{sfn|Sandri|2012|pp=637\u2013638}} but they are often thought to represent Hathor or Isis combined with Aphrodite making a gesture that represented fertility or protection against evil.{{sfn|Morris|2007|pp=218\u2013219}}\n\nHathor was one of a handful of deities, including Amun, Ptah, and Thoth, who were commonly prayed to for help with personal problems.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=349\u2013351}} Many Egyptians left offerings at temples or small shrines dedicated to the gods they prayed to. Most offerings to Hathor were used for their symbolism, not for their intrinsic value. Cloths painted with images of Hathor were common, as were plaques and figurines depicting her animal forms. Different types of offerings may have symbolized different goals on the part of the donor, but their meaning is usually unknown. Images of Hathor alluded to her mythical roles, like depictions of the maternal cow in the marsh.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=119, 347, 354\u2013355}} Offerings of sistra may have been meant to appease the goddess's dangerous aspects and bring out her positive ones,{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=157\u2013158}} while [[phalli]] represented a prayer for fertility, as shown by an inscription found on one example.{{sfn|Lesko|2008|pp=203\u2013204}}\n\nSome Egyptians also left written prayers to Hathor, inscribed on [[stela]]e or written as graffiti.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=349\u2013351}} Prayers to some deities, such as Amun, show that they were thought to punish wrongdoers and heal people who repented for their misbehavior. In contrast, prayers to Hathor mention only the benefits she could grant, such as abundant food during life and a well-provisioned burial after death.{{sfn|Sadek|1988|pp=89, 114\u2013115}}\n\n===Funerary practices===\n[[File:Nuovo regno, la dea hathor accoglie seth I, dalla valle dei re, 1294-1279 ac ca..JPG|thumb|right|upright|alt=Relief of Hathor holding a man's hand and lifting her menat necklace for him to grasp|Hathor welcoming [[Seti I]] into the afterlife, 13th century BC]]\nAs an afterlife deity, Hathor appeared frequently in funerary texts and art. In the early New Kingdom, for instance, Osiris, [[Anubis]], and Hathor were the three deities most commonly found in royal tomb decoration.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|p=110}} In that period she often appeared as the goddess welcoming the dead into the afterlife.{{sfn|Assmann|2005|p=171}} Other images referred to her more obliquely. Reliefs in Old Kingdom tombs show men and women performing a ritual called \"shaking the papyrus\". The significance of this rite is not known, but inscriptions sometimes say it was performed \"for Hathor\", and shaking papyrus stalks produces a rustling sound that may have been likened to the rattling of a sistrum.{{sfn|Woods|2011|pp=314\u2013316}} Other Hathoric imagery in tombs included the cow emerging from the mountain of the necropolis{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=179\u2013180}} and the seated figure of the goddess presiding over a garden in the afterlife.{{sfn|Billing|2004|pp=42\u201343}} Images of Nut were often painted or incised inside coffins, indicating that the coffin was her womb, from which the occupant would be reborn in the afterlife. In the Third Intermediate Period, Hathor began to be placed on the floor of the coffin, with Nut on the interior of the lid.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=39\u201340, 110}}\n\nTomb art from the Eighteenth Dynasty often shows people drinking, dancing, and playing music, as well as holding ''menat'' necklaces and sistra\u2014all imagery that alluded to Hathor. These images may represent private feasts that were celebrated in front of tombs to commemorate the people buried there, or they may show gatherings at temple festivals such as the Beautiful Festival of the Valley.{{sfn|Harrington|2016|pp=132\u2013136, 144\u2013147}} Festivals were thought to allow contact between the human and divine realms, and by extension, between the living and the dead. Thus, texts from tombs often expressed a wish that the deceased would be able to participate in festivals, primarily those dedicated to Osiris.{{sfn|Assmann|2005|p=225}} Tombs' festival imagery, however, may refer to festivals involving Hathor, such as the Festival of Drunkenness, or to the private feasts, which were also closely connected with her. Drinking and dancing at these feasts may have been meant to intoxicate the celebrants, as at the Festival of Drunkenness, allowing them to commune with the spirits of the deceased.{{sfn|Harrington|2016|pp=132\u2013136, 144\u2013147}}\n\nHathor was said to supply offerings to deceased people as early as the Old Kingdom, and spells to enable both men and women to join her retinue in the afterlife appeared as early as the ''[[Coffin Texts]]'' in the Middle Kingdom.{{sfn|Smith|2017|pp=251\u2013254}} Some burial goods that portray deceased women as goddesses may depict these women as followers of Hathor, although whether the imagery refers to Hathor or Isis is not known. The link between Hathor and deceased women was maintained into the Roman Period, the last stage of ancient Egyptian religion before its [[decline of ancient Egyptian religion|extinction]].{{sfn|Smith|2017|pp=384\u2013389}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cattle in religion and mythology]]\n* [[List of solar deities]]\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n==Works cited==\n{{refbegin|40em}}\n* {{cite book | last=Assmann | first=Jan |authorlink=Jan Assmann |others= Translated by David Lorton | title=Death and Salvation in Ancient Egypt |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rL2y0T6ukuYC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false | publisher= Cornell University Press | year =2005 |origyear= German edition 2001 | isbn = 978-0801442414 | ref = harv}}\n* {{cite journal |author-last=Billing |author-first=Nils |title=Writing an Image: The Formulation of the Tree Goddess Motif in the Book of the Dead, Ch. 59 |journal=[[Studien zur Alt\u00e4gyptischen Kultur]] |volume=32 |pages=35\u201350 |date=2004 |jstor=25152905 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Bleeker |first=C.

As a [[sky deity]], she was the mother or consort of the sky god [[Horus]] and the [[sun god]] [[Ra]], both of whom were connected with kingship, and thus she was the symbolic mother of their earthly representatives, the [[pharaoh]]s. She was one of several goddesses who acted as the [[Eye of Ra]], Ra's feminine counterpart, and in this form she had a vengeful [[Aspect (religion)|aspect]] that protected him from his enemies. Her beneficent side represented music, dance, joy, love, sexuality and maternal care, and she acted as the consort of several male deities and the mother of their sons. These two aspects of the goddess exemplified the [[women in ancient Egypt|Egyptian conception]] of [[femininity]]. Hathor crossed boundaries between worlds, helping deceased [[ancient Egyptian conception of the soul|souls]] in the transition to the [[ancient Egyptian afterlife beliefs|afterlife]].\n\nHathor was often depicted as a [[Cattle in religion|cow]], symbolizing her maternal and celestial aspect, although her most common form was a woman wearing a headdress of cow horns and a sun disk. She could also be represented as a lioness, cobra, or [[Ficus sycomorus|sycamore tree]].\n\nCattle goddesses similar to Hathor were portrayed in [[art of ancient Egypt|Egyptian art]] in the fourth millennium BC, but she may not have appeared until the [[Old Kingdom]] (c. 2686\u20132181 BC). With the patronage of Old Kingdom rulers she became one of Egypt's most important deities. More [[Egyptian temple|temples]] were dedicated to her than to any other goddess; her most prominent temple was [[Dendera Temple complex|Dendera]] in [[Upper Egypt]]. She was also worshipped in the temples of her male consorts. The Egyptians connected her with foreign lands such as [[Nubia]] and [[Canaan]] and their valuable goods, such as [[incense]] and [[semiprecious]] stones, and some of the peoples in those lands adopted her worship. In [[Egypt]], she was one of the deities commonly invoked in private prayers and [[votive offerings]], particularly by women desiring children.\n\nDuring the [[New Kingdom]] (c. 1550\u20131070 BC), goddesses such as [[Mut]] and [[Isis]] encroached on Hathor's position in royal ideology, but she remained one of the most widely worshipped deities. After the end of the New Kingdom, Hathor was increasingly overshadowed by Isis, but she continued to be venerated until the [[decline of ancient Egyptian religion|extinction of ancient Egyptian religion]] in the early centuries AD.\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Narmer Palette, Egypt, c. 3100 BC - Royal Ontario Museum - DSC09726.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Stone slate carved with reliefs|Replica of the [[Narmer Palette]], c. 31st century BC. The face of a woman with the horns and ears of a cow, representing Hathor or [[Bat (goddess)|Bat]], appears twice at the top of the palette and in a row below the belt of the king.]]\n[[File:Narmer palette 83d40m hathor atop columns below belt of king.png|thumb|right|Detail on the Narmar Palette below the belt of the king shows Hathor atop four columns]]\nImages of [[Ancient Egyptian cattle|cattle]] appear frequently in the [[art of ancient Egypt|artwork]] of [[Predynastic Egypt]] (before c. 3100 BC), as do images of women with upraised, curved arms reminiscent of the shape of bovine horns. Both types of imagery may represent [[ancient Egyptian deities|goddesses]] connected with [[Cattle in religion|cattle]].{{sfn|Hassan|1992|p=15}} Cows are [[cattle in religion and mythology|venerated in many cultures]], including ancient Egypt, as symbols of motherhood and nourishment, because they care for their calves and supply humans of all ages with milk. The [[list of ancient Egyptian palettes#Gerzeh Palette|Gerzeh Palette]], a [[cosmetic palette|stone palette]] from the [[Naqada II]] period of prehistory (c. 3500\u20133200 BC), shows the silhouette of a cow's head with inward-curving horns surrounded by stars. The palette suggests that this cow was also linked with the sky, as were several goddesses from later times who were represented in this form: Hathor, [[Mehet-Weret]], and [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]].{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=15\u201317}}\n\nDespite these early precedents, Hathor is not unambiguously mentioned or depicted until the [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt|Fourth Dynasty]] (c. 2613\u20132494 BC) of the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]],{{sfn|Wilkinson|1999|pp=244\u2013245}} although several artifacts that refer to her may date to the [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|Early Dynastic Period]] (c. 3100\u20132686 BC).{{sfn|Gillam|1995|p=214}} When Hathor does clearly appear, her horns curve outward, rather than inward like those in Predynastic art.{{sfn|Fischer|1962|pp=11\u201313}}\n\nA bovine deity with inward-curving horns appears on the [[Narmer Palette]] from near the start of Egyptian history, both atop the palette and on the belt or apron of the king, [[Narmer]]. The Egyptologist Henry George Fischer suggested this deity may be [[Bat (goddess)|Bat]], a goddess who was later depicted with a woman's face and inward-curling horns, seemingly reflecting the curve of the cow horns.{{sfn|Fischer|1962|pp=11\u201313}} The Egyptologist Lana Troy, however, identifies a passage in the ''[[Pyramid Texts]]'' from the late Old Kingdom that connects Hathor with the \"apron\" of the king, reminiscent of the goddess on Narmer's garments, and suggests the goddess on the Narmer Palette is Hathor rather than Bat,{{sfn|Wilkinson|1999|pp=244\u2013245}}{{sfn|Troy|1986|p=54}} and the motif resembles the head of Hathor atop the columns of temples built throughout many dynasties. \n\nIn the Fourth Dynasty, Hathor rose rapidly to prominence.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=81\u201383}} She supplanted an early crocodile god who was worshipped at [[Dendera]] in [[Upper Egypt]] to become Dendera's patron deity, and she increasingly absorbed the cult of Bat in the neighboring region of [[Hu, Egypt|Hu]], so that in the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] (c. 2055\u20131650 BC) the two deities fused into one.{{sfn|Fischer|1962|pp=7, 14\u201315}} The theology surrounding the [[pharaoh]] in the Old Kingdom, unlike that of earlier times, focused heavily on the sun god [[Ra]] as [[king of the gods]] and father and patron of the earthly king. Hathor ascended with Ra and became his mythological wife, and thus divine mother of the pharaoh.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=81\u201383}}\n\n==Roles==\nHathor took many forms and appeared in a wide variety of roles.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=77, 145}} The Egyptologist Robyn Gillam suggests that these diverse forms emerged when the royal goddess promoted by the Old Kingdom court subsumed many local goddesses worshipped by the general populace, who were then treated as manifestations of her.{{sfn|Gillam|1995|pp=217\u2013218}} Egyptian texts often speak of the manifestations of the goddess as \"Seven Hathors\"{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=77, 145}} or, less commonly, of many more Hathors\u2014as many as 362.{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|pp=71\u201372}} For these reasons, Gillam calls her \"a type of deity rather than a single entity\".{{sfn|Gillam|1995|pp=217\u2013218}} Hathor's diversity reflects the diversity of traits that the Egyptians associated with goddesses. More than any other deity, she exemplifies the [[women in ancient Egypt|Egyptian perception]] of [[femininity]].{{sfn|Troy|1986|pp=53\u201354}}\n\n===Sky goddess===\nHathor was given the [[epithet]]s \"mistress of the sky\" and \"mistress of the stars\", and was said to dwell in the sky with Ra and other sun deities. Egyptians thought of the sky as a body of water through which the sun god sailed, and they connected it with the waters from which, according to their [[ancient Egyptian creation myths|creation myths]], the sun emerged at the beginning of time. This cosmic mother goddess was often represented as a cow. Hathor and Mehet-Weret were both thought of as the cow who birthed the sun god and placed him between her horns. Like Nut, Hathor was said to give birth to the sun god each dawn.{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|pp=31\u201334, 46\u201347}}\n\nHathor's [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] name was ''\u1e25wt-\u1e25rw''{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|p=130}} or ''\u1e25wt-\u1e25r''.{{sfn|Billing|2004|p=39}} It is typically translated \"house of Horus\" but can also be rendered as \"my house is the sky\".{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|pp=25, 48}} The falcon god [[Horus]] represented, among other things, the sun and sky. The \"house\" referred to may be the sky in which Horus lives, or the goddess's womb from which he, as a sun god, is born each day.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=140}}\n\n===Solar goddess===\n{{further|Eye of Ra}}\nHathor was a [[solar deity]], a feminine counterpart to sun gods such as Horus and Ra, and was a member of the divine entourage that accompanied Ra as he sailed through the sky in his [[barque#Barques and barque shrines in Ancient Egypt|barque]].{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=140}} She was commonly called the \"Golden One\", referring to the radiance of the sun, and texts from [[Dendera Temple complex|her temple at Dendera]] say \"her rays illuminate the whole earth.\"{{sfn|Richter|2016|pp=128, 184\u2013185}} She was sometimes fused with another goddess, [[Nebethetepet]], whose name can mean \"Lady of the Offering\", \"Lady of Contentment\",{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=156}} or \"Lady of the Vulva\".{{sfn|Pinch|1993|p=155}} At Ra's cult center of [[Heliopolis (ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]], Hathor-Nebethetepet was worshipped as his consort,{{sfn|Quirke|2001|pp=102\u2013105}} and the Egyptologist Rudolf Anthes argued that Hathor's name referred to a mythical \"house of Horus\" at Heliopolis that was connected with the ideology of kingship.{{sfn|Gillam|1995|p=218}}\n\nShe was one of many goddesses to take the role of the Eye of Ra, a feminine personification of the disk of the sun and an extension of Ra's own power. Ra was sometimes portrayed inside the disk, which Troy interprets as meaning that the Eye goddess was thought of as a womb from which the sun god was born. Hathor's seemingly contradictory roles as mother, wife, and daughter of Ra reflected the daily cycle of the sun. At sunset the god entered the body of the goddess, impregnating her and fathering the deities born from her womb at sunrise: himself and the Eye goddess, who would later give birth to him. Ra gave rise to his daughter, the Eye goddess, who in turn gave rise to him, her son, in a cycle of constant regeneration.{{sfn|Troy|1986|pp=21\u201323, 25\u201327}}\n\nThe Eye of Ra protected the sun god from his enemies and was often represented as a [[uraeus]], or rearing [[cobra]], or as a lioness.{{sfn|Pinch|2004|pp=129\u2013130}} A form of the Eye of Ra known as \"Hathor of the Four Faces\", represented by a set of four cobras, was said to face in each of the [[cardinal directions]] to watch for threats to the sun god.{{sfn|Ritner|1990|p=39}} A group of myths, known from the [[New Kingdom]] (c. 1550\u20131070 BC) onward, describe what happens when the Eye goddess rampages uncontrolled. In the [[ancient Egyptian funerary texts|funerary text]] known as the ''[[Book of the Heavenly Cow]]'', Ra sends Hathor as the Eye of Ra to punish humans for plotting rebellion against his rule. She becomes the lioness goddess [[Sekhmet]] and massacres the rebellious humans, but Ra decides to prevent her from killing all humanity. He orders that beer be dyed red and poured out over the land. The Eye goddess drinks the beer, mistaking it for blood, and in her inebriated state reverts to being the benign and beautiful Hathor.{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|pp=169\u2013170}} Related to this story is the myth of the Distant Goddess, from the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late]] and [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]] periods. The Eye goddess, sometimes in the form of Hathor, rebels against Ra's control and rampages freely in a foreign land: [[Ancient Libya|Libya]] west of Egypt or [[Nubia]] to the south. Weakened by the loss of his Eye, Ra sends another god, such as [[Thoth]], to bring her back to him.{{sfn|Pinch|2004|pp=71\u201374}} Once pacified, the goddess returns to become the consort of the sun god or of the god who brings her back.{{sfn|Pinch|2004|p=130}} The two aspects of the Eye goddess\u2014violent and dangerous versus beautiful and joyful\u2014reflected the Egyptian belief that women, as the Egyptologist Carolyn Graves-Brown puts it, \"encompassed both extreme passions of fury and love.\"{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|pp=169\u2013170}}\n\n===Music, dance, and joy===\n[[File:Funerary banquet of Nebamun.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|alt=Painting of elaborately dressed men and women. Some women clap and play flutes while others dance.|Banquet scene from the tomb chapel of [[Nebamun]], 14th century BC. Its imagery of music and dancing alludes to Hathor.{{sfn|Harrington|2016|pp=132\u2013134}}]]\nEgyptian religion celebrated the sensory pleasures of life, believed to be among the gods' gifts to humanity. Egyptians ate, drank, danced, and played music at their religious festivals. They perfumed the air with flowers and [[incense]]. Many of Hathor's epithets link her to celebration; she is called the mistress of music, dance, garlands, [[myrrh]], and drunkenness. In hymns and temple reliefs, musicians play tambourines, harps, lyres, and sistra in Hathor's honor.{{sfn|Finnestad|1999|pp=113\u2013115}} The [[sistrum]], a rattle-like instrument, was particularly important in Hathor's worship. Sistra had erotic connotations and, by extension, alluded to the creation of new life.{{sfn|Manniche|2010|pp=13\u201314, 16\u201317}}\n\nThese aspects of Hathor were linked with the myth of the Eye of Ra. The Eye was pacified by beer in the story of the Destruction of Mankind. In some versions of the Distant Goddess myth, the wandering Eye's wildness abated when she was appeased with products of civilization like music, dance, and wine. The water of the annual [[inundation of the Nile]], colored red by sediment, was likened to wine, and to the red-dyed beer in the Destruction of Mankind. Festivals during the inundation therefore incorporated drink, music, and dance as a way to appease the returning goddess.{{sfn|Poo|2009|pp=153\u2013157}} A text from the [[Temple of Edfu]] says of Hathor, \"the gods play the sistrum for her, the goddesses dance for her to dispel her bad temper.\"{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|p=57}} A hymn to the goddess [[Raet-Tawy]] as a form of Hathor at the temple of [[Medamud]] describes the [[Festival of Drunkenness]] as part of her mythic return to Egypt.{{sfn|Darnell|1995|p=48}} Women carry bouquets of flowers, drunken revelers play drums, and people and animals from foreign lands dance for her as she enters the temple's festival booth. The noise of the celebration drives away hostile powers and ensures the goddess will remain in her joyful form as she awaits the male god of the temple, her mythological consort [[Montu]], whose son she will bear.{{sfn|Darnell|1995|pp=54, 62, 91\u201394}}\n\n===Sexuality, beauty, and love===\nHathor's joyful, ecstatic side indicates her feminine, procreative power. In some creation myths she helped produce the world itself.{{sfn|Pinch|2004|p=138}} [[Atum]], a creator god who contained all things within himself, was said to have produced his children [[Shu (Egyptian god)|Shu]] and [[Tefnut]], and thus begun the process of creation, by masturbating. The hand he used for this act, the Hand of Atum, represented the female aspect of himself and could be personified by Hathor, Nebethetepet, or another goddess, [[Iusaaset]].{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=99, 141, 156}} In a late creation myth from the [[Ptolemaic Period]] (332\u201330 BC), the god [[Khonsu]] is put in a central role, and Hathor is the goddess with whom Khonsu mates to enable creation.{{sfn|Cruz-Uribe|1994|pp=185, 187\u2013188}}\n\nHathor could be the consort of many male gods, of whom Ra was only the most prominent. [[Mut]] was the usual consort of [[Amun]], the preeminent deity during the New Kingdom who was often linked with Ra. But Mut was rarely portrayed alongside Amun in contexts related to sex or fertility, and in those circumstances, Hathor or [[Isis]] stood at his side instead.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=155}} In the late periods of Egyptian history, the form of Hathor from Dendera and the form of Horus from Edfu were considered husband and wife{{sfn|Lesko|1999|p=127}} and in different versions of the myth of the Distant Goddess, Hathor-Raettawy was the consort of Montu{{sfn|Darnell|1995|pp=47, 69}} and Hathor-Tefnut the consort of Shu.{{sfn|Pinch|2004|p=197}}\n\nHathor's sexual side was seen in some [[Ancient Egyptian literature#Narrative tales and stories|short stories]]. In a cryptic fragment of a Middle Kingdom story, known as \"The Tale of the Herdsman\", a herdsman encounters a hairy, animal-like goddess in a marsh and reacts with terror. On another day he encounters her as a nude, alluring woman. Most [[Egyptologists]] who study this story think this woman is Hathor or a goddess like her, one who can be wild and dangerous or benign and erotic. Thomas Schneider interprets the text as implying that between his two encounters with the goddess the herdsman has done something to pacify her.{{sfn|Schneider|2007|pp=315\u2013317}} In \"[[The Contendings of Horus and Set]]\", a New Kingdom short story about the [[Osiris myth#Conflict of Horus and Set|dispute between those two gods]], Ra is upset after being insulted by another god, [[Babi (mythology)|Babi]], and lies on his back alone. After some time, Hathor exposes her genitals to Ra, making him laugh and get up again to perform his duties as ruler of the gods. Life and order were thought to be dependent on Ra's activity, and the story implies that Hathor averted the disastrous consequences of his idleness. Her act may have lifted Ra's spirits partly because it sexually aroused him, although why he laughed is not fully understood.{{sfn|Morris|2007|pp=198\u2013199, 201, 207}}\n\nHathor was praised for her beautiful hair. Egyptian literature contains allusions to a myth not clearly described in any surviving texts, in which Hathor lost a lock of hair that represented her sexual allure. One text compares this loss with Horus's loss of his [[Eye of Horus|divine Eye]] and [[Set (mythology)|Set]]'s loss of his testicles during the struggle between the two gods, implying that the loss of Hathor's lock was as catastrophic for her as the maiming of Horus and Set was for them.{{sfn|Selden|1998|pp=346\u2013348}}\n\nHathor was called \"mistress of love\", as an extension of her sexual aspect. In the series of love poems from Papyrus Chester Beatty I, from the [[Twentieth Dynasty]] (c. 1189\u20131077 BC), men and women ask Hathor to bring their lovers to them: \"I prayed to her [Hathor] and she heard my prayer. She destined my mistress [loved one] for me. And she came of her own free will to see me.\"{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|pp=40\u201341}}\n\n===Motherhood and queenship===\n[[File:Hatshepsut temple5.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Relief of a cow with a disk between her horns. A human wearing a crown drinks from her udders.|Hathor as a cow suckling [[Hatshepsut]], a female pharaoh, at Hatshepsut's [[temple of Hatshepsut|temple at Deir el-Bahari]], 15th century BC]]\nHathor was considered the mother of various child deities. As suggested by her name, she was often thought of as both Horus's mother and consort.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=82\u201383}} As both the king's wife and his heir's mother, Hathor was the mythic counterpart of human queens.{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|p=130}}\n\nIsis and Osiris were considered Horus's parents in the [[Osiris myth]] as far back as the late Old Kingdom, but the relationship between Horus and Hathor may be older still. If so, Horus only came to be linked with Isis and Osiris as the Osiris myth emerged during the Old Kingdom.{{sfn|Hart|2005|p=62}} Even after Isis was firmly established as Horus's mother, Hathor continued to appear in this role, especially when nursing the pharaoh. Images of the Hathor-cow with a child in a papyrus thicket represented his mythological upbringing in a secluded marsh. Goddesses' milk was a sign of divinity and royal status. Thus, images in which Hathor nurses the pharaoh represent his right to rule.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=175\u2013176}} Hathor's relationship with Horus gave a healing aspect to her character, as she was said to have restored Horus's missing eye or eyes after Set attacked him.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=140}} In the version of this episode in \"The Contendings of Horus and Set\", Hathor finds Horus with his eyes torn out and heals the wounds with gazelle's milk.{{sfn|Pinch|2004|pp=131\u2013132}}\n\nBeginning in the [[Late Period of Egypt|Late Period]] (664\u2013323 BC), temples focused on the worship of a divine family: an adult male deity, his wife, and their immature son. Satellite buildings, known as [[mammisis]], were built in celebration of the birth of the local child deity. The child god represented the cyclical renewal of the cosmos and an archetypal heir to the kingship.{{sfn|Meeks|Favard-Meeks|1996|pp=183\u2013184}} Hathor was the mother in many of these local triads of gods. At Dendera, the mature Horus of Edfu was the father and Hathor the mother, while their child was [[Ihy]], a god whose name meant \"sistrum-player\" and who personified the jubilation associated with the instrument.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=132\u2013133}} At [[Kom Ombo]], Hathor's local form, Tasenetnofret, was mother to Horus's son Panebtawy.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=123, 168}} Other children of Hathor included a minor deity from the town of Hu, named Neferhotep,{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=132\u2013133}} and several child forms of Horus.{{sfn|Hart|2005|p=71}}\n\nThe milky sap of the [[ficus sycomorus|sycamore tree]], which the Egyptians regarded as a symbol of life, became one of her symbols.{{sfn|Roberts|2000|pp=26\u201327}} The milk was equated with water of the Nile inundation and thus fertility.{{sfn|Richter|2016|pp=179\u2013182}} In the late Ptolemaic and [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman Periods]], many temples contained a creation myth that adapted long-standing ideas about creation.{{sfn|McClain|2011|pp=3\u20136}} The version from Hathor's temple at Dendera emphasizes that she, as a female solar deity, was the first being to emerge from the primordial waters that preceded creation, and her life-giving light and milk nourished all living things.{{sfn|Richter|2016|pp=169\u2013172, 185}}\n\nLike [[Meskhenet]], another goddess who presided over birth, Hathor was connected with ''[[shai]]'', the Egyptian concept of [[fate]], particularly when she took the form of the Seven Hathors. In two New Kingdom works of fiction, \"[[The Tale of Two Brothers]]\" and \"[[The Tale of the Doomed Prince]]\", the Hathors appear at the births of major characters and foretell the manner of their deaths.{{sfn|Hoffmeier|2001|pp=507\u2013508}}\n\nHathor's maternal aspects can be compared with those of Isis and Mut, yet there are many contrasts between them. Isis's devotion to her husband and care for their child represented a more socially acceptable form of love than Hathor's uninhibited sexuality,{{sfn|Griffiths|2001|p=189}} and Mut's character was more authoritative than sexual.{{sfn|te Velde|2001|p=455}} The text of the first century AD [[Papyrus Insinger]] likens a faithful wife, the mistress of a household, to Mut, while comparing Hathor to a strange woman who tempts a married man.{{sfn|te Velde|2001|p=455}}\n\n===Foreign lands and goods===\nEgypt maintained trade relations with the coastal cities of [[Syria (region)|Syria]] and [[Canaan]], particularly [[Byblos]], placing Egyptian religion in contact with the [[ancient Canaanite religion|religions of that region]].{{sfn|Hollis|2009|p=2}} At some point, perhaps as early as the Old Kingdom, the Egyptians began to refer to the patron goddess of Byblos, [[Baalat Gebal]], as a local form of Hathor.{{sfn|Espinel|2002|pp=117\u2013119}} So strong was Hathor's link to Byblos that texts from Dendera say she resided there.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=139}} The Egyptians sometimes equated [[Anat]], an aggressive Canaanite goddess who came to be worshipped in Egypt during the New Kingdom, with Hathor.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=137}} Some Canaanite artworks depict a nude goddess with a curling wig taken from Hathor's iconography.{{sfn|Cornelius|2004|p=45}} Which goddess these images represent is not known, but the Egyptians adopted her iconography and came to regard her as an independent deity, [[Qetesh]],{{sfn|Cornelius|2004|pp=96\u201397}} whom they associated with Hathor.{{sfn|Hart|2005|p=132}}\n\nHathor's solar character may have played a role in linking her with trade: she was believed to protect ships on the Nile and in the seas beyond Egypt, as she protected the barque of Ra in the sky.{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|pp=72\u201374}} The mythological wandering of the Eye goddess in Nubia or Libya gave her a connection with those lands as well.{{sfn|Darnell|1995|pp=93\u201394}}\n\nHathor was closely connected with the [[Sinai Peninsula]],{{sfn|Hart|2005|p=65}} which was not considered part of Egypt proper but was the site of Egyptian mines for copper, [[turquoise]], and [[malachite]] during the Middle and New Kingdoms.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|p=52}} One of Hathor's epithets, \"Lady of ''Mefkat''\", may have referred specifically to turquoise or to all blue-green minerals. She was also called \"Lady of [[Egyptian faience|Faience]]\", a blue-green ceramic that Egyptians likened to turquoise.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=49\u201350}}{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=143}} Hathor was also worshipped at various quarries and mining sites in Egypt's [[Eastern Desert]], such as the [[amethyst]] mines of Wadi el-Hudi, where she was sometimes called \"Lady of Amethyst\".{{sfn|Espinel|2005|pp=61, 65\u201366}}\n\nSouth of Egypt, Hathor's influence was thought to have extended over the [[land of Punt]], which lay along the Red Sea coast and was a major source for the incense with which Hathor was linked, as well as with Nubia, northwest of Punt.{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|pp=72\u201374}} The [[autobiography of Harkhuf]], an official in the [[Sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Sixth Dynasty]] (c. 2345\u20132181 BC), describes his expedition to a land in or near Nubia, from which he brought back great quantities of [[ebony]], panther skins, and incense for the king. The text describes these exotic goods as Hathor's gift to the pharaoh.{{sfn|Hart|2005|p=65}} Egyptian expeditions to mine gold in Nubia introduced her cult to the region during the Middle and New Kingdoms,{{sfn|Yellin|2012|pp=125\u2013128}} and New Kingdom pharaohs built several temples to her in the portions of Nubia that they ruled.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|pp=227\u2013230}}\n\n===Afterlife===\n[[Image:BD Hathor Mistress of the West.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Painting of a cow whose head protrudes from a hill, in front of which stand papyrus stalks and a pyramidal chapel|Hathor, in bovine form, emerges from a hill representing the [[Theban necropolis]], in a copy of the ''[[Book of the Dead]]'' from the 13th century BC]]\nHathor was one of several goddesses believed to assist deceased souls in the [[ancient Egyptian afterlife beliefs|afterlife]].{{sfn|Assmann|2005|p=153}} One of these was [[Imentet]], the goddess of the west, who personified the [[necropolises]], or clusters of tombs, on the west bank of the Nile, and the realm of the afterlife itself. She was often regarded as a specialized manifestation of Hathor.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=145\u2013146}}\n\nJust as she crossed the boundary between Egypt and foreign lands, Hathor passed through the boundary between the living and the [[Duat]], the realm of the dead.{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|p=166}} She helped the spirits of deceased humans enter the Duat and was closely linked with tomb sites, where that transition began.{{sfn|Meeks|Favard-Meeks|1996|pp=88, 164}} The [[Theban necropolis]], for example, was often portrayed as a stylized mountain with the cow of Hathor emerging from it.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=179\u2013180}} Her role as a sky goddess was also linked to the afterlife. Because the sky goddess\u2014either Nut or Hathor\u2014assisted Ra in his daily rebirth, she had an important part in [[Egyptian afterlife beliefs]], according to which deceased humans were reborn like the sun god.{{sfn|Vischak|2001|p=82}} Coffins, tombs, and the underworld itself were interpreted as the womb of this goddess, from which the deceased soul would be reborn.{{sfn|Assmann|2005|pp=170\u2013173}}{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=39\u201340, 110}}\n\nNut, Hathor, and Imentet could each, in different texts, lead the deceased into a place where they would receive food and drink for eternal sustenance. Thus, Hathor, as Imentet, often appears on tombs, welcoming the deceased person as her child into a blissful afterlife.{{sfn|Assmann|2005|pp=152\u2013154, 170\u2013173}} In New Kingdom funerary texts and artwork, the afterlife was often illustrated as a pleasant, fertile garden, over which Hathor sometimes presided.{{sfn|Billing|2004|pp=42\u201343}} The welcoming afterlife goddess was often portrayed as a goddess in the form of a tree, giving water to the deceased. Nut most commonly filled this role, but the tree goddess was sometimes called Hathor instead.{{sfn|Billing|2004|pp=37\u201338}}\n\nThe afterlife also had a sexual aspect. In the Osiris myth, the murdered god [[Osiris]] was resurrected when he copulated with Isis and conceived Horus. In solar ideology, Ra's union with the sky goddess allowed his own rebirth. Sex therefore enabled the rebirth of the deceased, and goddesses like Isis and Hathor served to rouse the deceased to new life. But they merely stimulated the male deities' regenerative powers, rather than playing the central role.{{sfn|Cooney|2010|pp=227\u2013229}}\n\nAncient Egyptians prefixed the names of the deceased with Osiris's name to connect them with his resurrection. For example, a woman named [[Henutmehyt]] would be dubbed \"Osiris-Henutmehyt\". Over time they increasingly associated the deceased with both male and female divine powers.{{sfn|Cooney|2010|pp=227\u2013229, 235\u2013236}} As early as the late Old Kingdom, women were sometimes said to join the worshippers of Hathor in the afterlife, just as men joined the following of Osiris. In the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt|Third Intermediate Period]] (c. 1070\u2013664 BC), Egyptians began to add Hathor's name to that of deceased women in place of that of Osiris. In some cases, women were called \"Osiris-Hathor\", indicating that they benefited from the revivifying power of both deities. In these late periods, Hathor was sometimes said to rule the afterlife as Osiris did.{{sfn|Smith|2017|pp=251\u2013254}}\n\n==Iconography==\nHathor was often depicted as a cow bearing the sun disk between her horns, especially when shown nursing the king. She could also appear as a woman with the head of a cow. Her most common form, however, was a woman wearing a headdress of the horns and sun disk, often with a red or turquoise sheath dress, or a dress combining both colors. Sometimes the horns stood atop a low [[modius (headdress)|modius]] or the vulture headdress that [[Egyptian queens]] often wore in the New Kingdom. Because Isis adopted the same headdress during the New Kingdom, the two goddesses can be distinguished only if labeled in writing. When in the role of Imentet, Hathor wore the [[emblem of the west]] upon her head instead of the horned headdress.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=143\u2013144, 148}} The Seven Hathors were sometimes portrayed as a set of seven cows, accompanied by a minor sky and afterlife deity called the Bull of the West.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=77, 175}}\n\nSome animals other than cattle could represent Hathor. The uraeus was a common motif in Egyptian art and could represent a variety of goddesses who were identified with the Eye of Ra.{{sfn|Pinch|2004|pp=198\u2013199}} When Hathor was depicted as a uraeus, it represented the ferocious and protective aspects of her character. She also appeared as a lioness, and this form had a similar meaning.{{sfn|Roberts|1997|pp=8\u201310}} In contrast, the [[domestic cat]], which was sometimes connected with Hathor, often represented the Eye goddess's pacified form.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=190\u2013197}} When portrayed as a sycamore tree, Hathor was usually shown with the upper body of her human form emerging from the trunk.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=168\u2013169}}\n\nLike other goddesses, Hathor might carry a stalk of papyrus as a staff, though she could instead hold a ''[[Was-sceptre|was]]'' staff, a symbol of power that was usually restricted to male deities.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=143}} The only goddesses who used the ''was'' were those, like Hathor, who were linked with the Eye of Ra.{{sfn|Graham|2001|p=166}} She also commonly carried a sistrum or a ''menat'' necklace. The sistrum came in two varieties: a simple loop shape or the more complex ''naos'' sistrum, which was shaped to resemble a ''[[Cella#Egyptian temples|naos]]'' shrine and flanked by [[volute]]s resembling the antennae of the Bat emblem.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=153\u2013159}} The ''[[menat]]'' necklace, made up of many strands of beads, was shaken in ceremonies in Hathor's honor, similarly to the sistrum.{{sfn|Hart|2005|p=65}} Images of it were sometimes seen as personifications of Hathor herself.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|p=278}} Mirrors were another of her symbols, because in Egypt they were often made of gold or bronze and therefore symbolized the sun disk, and because they were connected with beauty and femininity. Some mirror handles were made in the shape of Hathor's face.{{sfn|Wilkinson|1993|pp=32, 83}}\n\nHathor was sometimes represented as a human face with bovine ears, seen from the front rather than in the profile-based perspective that was typical of Egyptian art. When she appears in this form, the tresses on either side of her face often curl into loops. This mask-like face was placed on the [[capital (architecture)|capitals]] of columns beginning in the late Old Kingdom. Columns of this style were used in many temples to Hathor and other goddesses.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=135\u2013139}} These columns have two or four faces, which may represent the duality between different aspects of the goddess or the watchfulness of Hathor of the Four Faces. The designs of Hathoric columns have a complex relationship with those of sistra. Both styles of sistrum can bear the Hathor mask on the handle, and Hathoric columns often incorporate the ''naos'' sistrum shape above the goddess's head.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=153\u2013159}}\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"220px\">\nFile:Hathor Amulet MET DP136527.jpg|alt=Refer to caption|Amulet of Hathor as a [[uraeus]] wearing a ''naos'' headdress, early to mid-first millennium BC\nFile:Hathor's head.

Hathor was one of the few deities to receive such donations.{{sfn|Goedicke|1978|pp=118\u2013123}} Late Old Kingdom rulers especially promoted the cult of Hathor in the provinces, as a way of binding those regions to the royal court. She may have absorbed the traits of contemporary provincial goddesses.{{sfn|Morris|2011|pp=75\u201376}}\n\nMany female royals, though not reigning queens, held positions in the cult during the Old Kingdom.{{sfn|Gillam|1995|pp=222\u2013226, 231}} [[Mentuhotep II]], who became the first pharaoh of the Middle Kingdom despite having no relation to the Old Kingdom rulers, sought to legitimize his rule by portraying himself as Hathor's son. The first images of the Hathor-cow suckling the king date to his reign, and several priestesses of Hathor were depicted as though they were his wives, although he may not have actually married them.{{sfn|Gillam|1995|p=231}}{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|pp=135\u2013136}} In the course of the Middle Kingdom, queens were increasingly seen as directly embodying the goddess, just as the king embodied Ra.{{sfn|Gillam|1995|p=234}} The emphasis on the queen as Hathor continued through the New Kingdom. Queens were portrayed with the headdress of Hathor beginning in the late Eighteenth Dynasty. An image of the [[sed festival]] of [[Amenhotep III]], meant to celebrate and renew his rule, shows the king together with Hathor and his queen [[Tiye]], which could mean that the king symbolically married the goddess in the course of the festival.{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|pp=132\u2013133}}\n\n[[Hatshepsut]], a woman who ruled as a pharaoh in the early New Kingdom, emphasized her relationship to Hathor in a different way.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=105\u2013107}} She used [[ancient Egyptian royal titulary|names and titles]] that linked her to a variety of goddesses, including Hathor, so as to legitimize her rule in what was normally a male position.{{sfn|Robins|1999|pp=107\u2013112}} She built several temples to Hathor and placed her own [[Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut|mortuary temple]], which incorporated a chapel dedicated to the goddess, at [[Deir el-Bahari]], which had been a cult site of Hathor since the Middle Kingdom.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=105\u2013107}}\n\nThe preeminence of Amun during the New Kingdom gave greater visibility to his consort Mut, and in the course of the period, Isis began appearing in roles that traditionally belonged to Hathor alone, such as that of the goddess in the solar barque. Despite the growing prominence of these deities, Hathor remained important, particularly in relation to fertility, sexuality, and queenship, throughout the New Kingdom.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=119\u2013120, 178\u2013179}}\n\nAfter the New Kingdom, Isis increasingly overshadowed Hathor and other goddesses as she took on their characteristics.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|p=129}} In the [[Ptolemaic period]] (305\u201330 BC), when [[Greeks]] governed Egypt and [[Ancient Greek religion|their religion]] developed a complex relationship with that of Egypt, the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] adopted and modified the Egyptian ideology of kingship. Beginning with [[Arsinoe II]], wife of [[Ptolemy II]], the Ptolemies closely linked their queens with Isis and with several Greek goddesses, particularly their own goddess of love and sexuality, [[Aphrodite]].{{sfn|Selden|1998|pp=312, 339}} Nevertheless, when the Greeks referred to Egyptian gods by the names of their own gods (a practice called ''[[interpretatio Graeca]]''), they sometimes called Hathor Aphrodite.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=141}} Traits of Isis, Hathor, and Aphrodite were all combined to justify the treatment of Ptolemaic queens as goddesses. Thus, the poet [[Callimachus]] alluded to the myth of Hathor's lost lock of hair when praising [[Berenice II]] for sacrificing her own hair to Aphrodite,{{sfn|Selden|1998|pp=346\u2013348}} and iconographic traits that Isis and Hathor shared, such as the bovine horns and vulture headdress, appeared on images portraying Ptolemaic queens as Aphrodite.{{sfn|Cheshire|2007|pp=157\u2013163}}\n\n===Temples in Egypt===\n[[File:Dendera hypostyle hall crosswise.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Room with tall stone columns topped by faces of women.

During the New Kingdom era, the temple of Hathor of the Southern Sycomore was her main temple in Memphis.{{sfn|Gillam|1995|pp=219\u2013221}} At that site she was described as the daughter of the city's main deity, [[Ptah]].{{sfn|Vischak|2001|p=82}} The cult of Ra and Atum at Heliopolis, northeast of Memphis, included a temple to Hathor-Nebethetepet that was probably built in the Middle Kingdom. A willow and a sycomore tree stood near the sanctuary and may have been worshipped as manifestations of the goddess.{{sfn|Quirke|2001|pp=102\u2013105}} A few cities farther north in the [[Nile Delta]], such as [[Yamu]] and [[Terenuthis]], also had temples to her.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|pp=108, 111}}\n\nAs the rulers of the Old Kingdom made an effort to develop towns in Upper and [[Middle Egypt]], several cult centers of Hathor were founded across the region, at sites such as [[Cusae]], [[Akhmim]], and [[Naga ed-Der]].{{sfn|Gillam|1995|pp=226, 229}} In the [[First Intermediate Period]] (c. 2181\u20132055) her cult statue from Dendera was periodically carried to the Theban necropolis. During the beginning of the Middle Kingdom, Mentuhotep II established a permanent cult center for her in the necropolis at Deir el-Bahari.{{sfn|Goedicke|1991|pp=245, 252}} The nearby village of [[Deir el-Medina]], home to the tomb workers of the necropolis during the New Kingdom, also contained temples of Hathor. One continued to function and was periodically rebuilt as late as the Ptolemaic Period, centuries after the village was abandoned.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|pp=189\u2013190}}\n\nDendera, Hathor's oldest temple in Upper Egypt, dates to at least to the Fourth Dynasty.{{sfn|Gillam|1995|p=227}} After the end of the Old Kingdom it surpassed her Memphite temples in importance.{{sfn|Vischak|2001|p=83}} Many kings made additions to the temple complex through Egyptian history. The last version of the temple was built in the Ptolemaic and Roman Periods and is today one of the best-preserved Egyptian temples from that time.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|pp=149\u2013151}}\n\nIn the Old Kingdom, most priests of Hathor, including the highest ranks, were women. Many of these women were members of the royal family.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=240\u2013241}} In the course of the Middle Kingdom, women were increasingly excluded from the highest priestly positions, at the same time that queens were becoming more closely tied to Hathor's cult. Thus, non-royal women disappeared from the high ranks of Hathor's priesthood,{{sfn|Gillam|1995|pp=233\u2013234}} although women continued to serve as musicians and singers in temple cults across Egypt.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=243\u2013244}}\n\nThe most frequent temple rite for any deity was the daily offering ritual, in which the cult image, or statue, of a deity would be clothed and given food.{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=328}} The daily ritual was largely the same in every Egyptian temple,{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=328}} although the goods given as offerings could vary according to which deity received them.{{sfn|Meeks|Favard-Meeks|1996|pp=126\u2013128}} Wine and beer were common offerings in all temples, but especially in rituals in Hathor's honor,{{sfn|Poo|2010|pp=2\u20133}} and she and the goddesses related to her often received sistra and ''menat'' necklaces.{{sfn|Meeks|Favard-Meeks|1996|pp=126\u2013128}} In Late and Ptolemaic times, they were also offered a pair of mirrors, representing the sun and the moon.{{sfn|Derriks|2001|pp=421\u2013422}}\n\n===Festivals===\nMany of Hathor's annual festivals were celebrated with drinking and dancing that served a ritual purpose. Revelers at these festivals may have aimed to reach a state of [[religious ecstasy]], which was otherwise rare or nonexistent in ancient Egyptian religion. Graves-Brown suggests that celebrants in Hathor's festivals aimed to reach an [[altered state of consciousness]] to allow them interact with the divine realm.{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|pp=166\u2013169}} An example is the Festival of Drunkenness, commemorating the return of the Eye of Ra, which was celebrated on the twentieth day of the [[Thout|month of Thout]] at temples to Hathor and to other Eye goddesses. It was celebrated as early as the Middle Kingdom, but it is best known from Ptolemaic and Roman times.{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|pp=166\u2013169}} The dancing, eating and drinking that took place during the Festival of Drunkenness represented the opposite of the sorrow, hunger, and thirst that the Egyptians associated with death. Whereas the rampages of the Eye of Ra brought death to humans, the Festival of Drunkenness celebrated life, abundance, and joy.{{sfn|Frandsen|1999|pp=131, 142\u2013143}}\n\nIn a local Theban festival known as the [[Beautiful Festival of the Valley]], which began to be celebrated in the Middle Kingdom, the cult image of Amun from the [[Precinct of Amun-Re|Temple of Karnak]] visited the temples in the Theban Necropolis while members of the community went to the tombs of their deceased relatives to drink, eat, and celebrate.{{sfn|Teeter|2011|pp=67\u201368}} Hathor was not involved in this festival until the early New Kingdom,{{sfn|Sadek|1988|p=49}} after which Amun's overnight stay in the temples at Deir el-Bahari came to be seen as his sexual union with her.{{sfn|Teeter|2011|p=70}}\n\nSeveral temples in Ptolemaic times, including that of Dendera, observed the Egyptian new year with a series of ceremonies in which images of the temple deity were supposed to be revitalized by contact with the sun god. On the days leading up to the new year, Dendera's statue of Hathor was taken to the ''[[wabet]]'', a specialized room in the temple, and placed under a ceiling decorated with images of the sky and sun. On the first day of the new year, the first day of the [[Thoth (month)|month of Thoth]], the Hathor image was carried up to the roof to be bathed in genuine sunlight.{{sfn|Meeks|Favard-Meeks|1996|pp=193\u2013198}}\n\nThe best-documented festival focused on Hathor is another Ptolemaic celebration, the Festival of the Beautiful Reunion. It took place over fourteen days in the month of [[Epiphi]].{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|p=93}}{{sfn|Richter|2016|p=4}} Hathor's cult image from Dendera was carried by boat to several temple sites to visit the gods of those temples. The endpoint of the journey was the Temple of Horus at [[Edfu]], where the Hathor statue from Dendera met that of Horus of Edfu and the two were placed together.{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|p=94}} On one day of the festival, these images were carried out to a shrine where primordial deities such as the sun god and the [[Ennead]] were said to be buried. The texts say the divine couple performed offering rites for these entombed gods.{{sfn|Verner|2013|pp=437\u2013439}} Many Egyptologists regard this festival as a [[hieros gamos|ritual marriage]] between Horus and Hathor, although Martin Stadler challenges this view, arguing that it instead represented the rejuvenation of the buried creator gods.{{sfn|Stadler|2008|pp=4\u20136}} C.

Bleeker thought the Beautiful Reunion was another celebration of the return of the Distant Goddess, citing allusions in the temple's festival texts to the myth of the solar eye.{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|pp=98\u2013101}} Barbara Richter argues that the festival represented all three things at once. She points out that the birth of Horus and Hathor's son Ihy was celebrated at Dendera nine months after the Festival of the Beautiful Reunion, implying that Hathor's visit to Horus represented Ihy's conception.{{sfn|Richter|2016|pp=4, 202\u2013205}}\n\nThe third month of the [[Egyptian calendar]], [[Hathor (month)|Hathor or Athyr]], was named for the goddess. Festivities in her honor took place throughout the month, although they are not recorded in the texts from Dendera.{{sfn|Verner|2013|p=43}}\n\n===Worship outside Egypt===\n[[File:Temple of Hathor in Timna Park in summer 2011 (1).JPG|thumb|upright|right|alt=Foundations of a small stone wall at the base of a desert cliff|Remains of the Hathor shrine in the [[Timna Valley]]]]\nEgyptian kings as early as the Old Kingdom donated goods to the temple of Baalat Gebal in Byblos, using the syncretism of Baalat with Hathor to cement their close trading relationship with Byblos.{{sfn|Espinel|2002|pp=116\u2013118}} A temple to Hathor as Lady of Byblos was built during the reign of [[Thutmose III]], although it may simply have been a shrine within the temple of Baalat.{{sfn|Traunecker|2001|p=110}} After the breakdown of the New Kingdom, Hathor's prominence in Byblos diminished along with Egypt's trade links to the city. A few artifacts from the early first millennium BC suggest that the Egyptians began equating Baalat with Isis at that time.{{sfn|Zernecke|2013|pp=227\u2013230}} A myth about Isis's presence in Byblos, related by the Greek author [[Plutarch]] in his work ''On Isis and Osiris'' in the 2nd century AD, suggests that by his time Isis had entirely supplanted Hathor in the city.{{sfn|Hollis|2009|pp=4\u20135}}\n\nEgyptians in the Sinai built a few temples in the region. The largest was a complex dedicated primarily to Hathor as patroness of mining at [[Serabit el-Khadim]], on the west side of the peninsula.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|pp=238\u2013239}} It was occupied from the middle of the Middle Kingdom to near the end of the New.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=55\u201357}} The [[Timna Valley]], on the fringes of the Egyptian empire on the east side of the peninsula, was the site of seasonal mining expeditions during the New Kingdom. It included a shrine to Hathor that was probably deserted during the off-season. The local [[Midianites]], whom the Egyptians used as part of the mining workforce, may have given offerings to Hathor as their overseers did. After the Egyptians abandoned the site in the Twentieth Dynasty, however, the Midianites converted the shrine to a tent shrine devoted to their own deities.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=59\u201369}}\n\nIn contrast, the Nubians in the south fully incorporated Hathor into their religion. During the New Kingdom, when most of Nubia was under Egyptian control, pharaohs dedicated several temples in Nubia to Hathor, such as those at [[Faras]] and [[Mirgissa]].{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|pp=227\u2013230}} Amenhotep III and [[Ramesses II]] both built temples in Nubia that celebrated their respective queens as manifestations of female deities, including Hathor: Amenhotep's wife Tiye at [[Sedeinga]]{{sfn|Morkot|2012|pp=325\u2013326}} and Ramesses's wife [[Nefertari]] at the [[Abu Simbel temples#Small Temple|Small Temple of Abu Simbel]].{{sfn|Fisher|2012|pp=357\u2013358}} The independent Kingdom of Kush, which emerged in Nubia after the collapse of the New Kingdom, based its beliefs about [[List of monarchs of Kush|Kushite kings]] on the royal ideology of Egypt. Therefore, Hathor, Isis, Mut, and Nut were all seen as the mythological mother of each Kushite king and equated with his female relatives, such as the ''[[kandake]]'', the Kushite queen or [[queen mother]], who had prominent roles in Kushite religion.{{sfn|Kendall|2010b}} At [[Jebel Barkal]], a site sacred to Amun, the Kushite king [[Taharqa]] built a pair of temples, one dedicated to Hathor and [[Temple of Mut, Jebel Barkal|one to Mut]] as consorts of Amun, replacing New Kingdom Egyptian temples that may have been dedicated to these same goddesses.{{sfn|Kendall|2010a|pp=1, 12}} But Isis was the most prominent of the Egyptian goddesses worshipped in Nubia, and her status there increased over time. Thus, in the Meroitic period of Nubian history (c. 300 BC \u2013 AD 400), Hathor appeared in temples mainly as a companion to Isis.{{sfn|Yellin|2012|pp=128, 133}}\n\n===Popular worship===\n[[File:Plaque of a woman giving birth assisted by Hathor.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Plaque showing a woman squatting while cow-headed women stand at either side|Ptolemaic plaque of a woman giving birth assisted by two figures of Hathor, fourth to first century BC]]\nIn addition to formal and public rituals at temples, Egyptians privately worshipped deities for personal reasons, including at their homes. Birth was hazardous for both mother and child in ancient Egypt, yet children were much desired. Thus fertility and safe childbirth are among the most prominent concerns in their popular religion, and fertility deities such as Hathor and [[Taweret]] were commonly worshipped in household shrines. Egyptian women squatted on bricks while giving birth, and the only known surviving birth brick from ancient Egypt is decorated with an image of a woman holding her child flanked by images of Hathor.{{sfn|Ritner|2008|pp=173\u2013175, 181}} In Roman times, [[terracotta]] figurines, sometimes found in a domestic context, depicted a woman with an elaborate headdress exposing her genitals, as Hathor did to cheer up Ra.{{sfn|Morris|2007|pp=218\u2013219}} The meaning of these figurines is not known,{{sfn|Sandri|2012|pp=637\u2013638}} but they are often thought to represent Hathor or Isis combined with Aphrodite making a gesture that represented fertility or protection against evil.{{sfn|Morris|2007|pp=218\u2013219}}\n\nHathor was one of a handful of deities, including Amun, Ptah, and Thoth, who were commonly prayed to for help with personal problems.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=349\u2013351}} Many Egyptians left offerings at temples or small shrines dedicated to the gods they prayed to. Most offerings to Hathor were used for their symbolism, not for their intrinsic value. Cloths painted with images of Hathor were common, as were plaques and figurines depicting her animal forms. Different types of offerings may have symbolized different goals on the part of the donor, but their meaning is usually unknown. Images of Hathor alluded to her mythical roles, like depictions of the maternal cow in the marsh.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=119, 347, 354\u2013355}} Offerings of sistra may have been meant to appease the goddess's dangerous aspects and bring out her positive ones,{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=157\u2013158}} while [[phalli]] represented a prayer for fertility, as shown by an inscription found on one example.{{sfn|Lesko|2008|pp=203\u2013204}}\n\nSome Egyptians also left written prayers to Hathor, inscribed on [[stela]]e or written as graffiti.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=349\u2013351}} Prayers to some deities, such as Amun, show that they were thought to punish wrongdoers and heal people who repented for their misbehavior. In contrast, prayers to Hathor mention only the benefits she could grant, such as abundant food during life and a well-provisioned burial after death.{{sfn|Sadek|1988|pp=89, 114\u2013115}}\n\n===Funerary practices===\n[[File:Nuovo regno, la dea hathor accoglie seth I, dalla valle dei re, 1294-1279 ac ca..JPG|thumb|right|upright|alt=Relief of Hathor holding a man's hand and lifting her menat necklace for him to grasp|Hathor welcoming [[Seti I]] into the afterlife, 13th century BC]]\nAs an afterlife deity, Hathor appeared frequently in funerary texts and art. In the early New Kingdom, for instance, Osiris, [[Anubis]], and Hathor were the three deities most commonly found in royal tomb decoration.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|p=110}} In that period she often appeared as the goddess welcoming the dead into the afterlife.{{sfn|Assmann|2005|p=171}} Other images referred to her more obliquely. Reliefs in Old Kingdom tombs show men and women performing a ritual called \"shaking the papyrus\". The significance of this rite is not known, but inscriptions sometimes say it was performed \"for Hathor\", and shaking papyrus stalks produces a rustling sound that may have been likened to the rattling of a sistrum.{{sfn|Woods|2011|pp=314\u2013316}} Other Hathoric imagery in tombs included the cow emerging from the mountain of the necropolis{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=179\u2013180}} and the seated figure of the goddess presiding over a garden in the afterlife.{{sfn|Billing|2004|pp=42\u201343}} Images of Nut were often painted or incised inside coffins, indicating that the coffin was her womb, from which the occupant would be reborn in the afterlife. In the Third Intermediate Period, Hathor began to be placed on the floor of the coffin, with Nut on the interior of the lid.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=39\u201340, 110}}\n\nTomb art from the Eighteenth Dynasty often shows people drinking, dancing, and playing music, as well as holding ''menat'' necklaces and sistra\u2014all imagery that alluded to Hathor. These images may represent private feasts that were celebrated in front of tombs to commemorate the people buried there, or they may show gatherings at temple festivals such as the Beautiful Festival of the Valley.{{sfn|Harrington|2016|pp=132\u2013136, 144\u2013147}} Festivals were thought to allow contact between the human and divine realms, and by extension, between the living and the dead. Thus, texts from tombs often expressed a wish that the deceased would be able to participate in festivals, primarily those dedicated to Osiris.{{sfn|Assmann|2005|p=225}} Tombs' festival imagery, however, may refer to festivals involving Hathor, such as the Festival of Drunkenness, or to the private feasts, which were also closely connected with her. Drinking and dancing at these feasts may have been meant to intoxicate the celebrants, as at the Festival of Drunkenness, allowing them to commune with the spirits of the deceased.{{sfn|Harrington|2016|pp=132\u2013136, 144\u2013147}}\n\nHathor was said to supply offerings to deceased people as early as the Old Kingdom, and spells to enable both men and women to join her retinue in the afterlife appeared as early as the ''[[Coffin Texts]]'' in the Middle Kingdom.{{sfn|Smith|2017|pp=251\u2013254}} Some burial goods that portray deceased women as goddesses may depict these women as followers of Hathor, although whether the imagery refers to Hathor or Isis is not known. The link between Hathor and deceased women was maintained into the Roman Period, the last stage of ancient Egyptian religion before its [[decline of ancient Egyptian religion|extinction]].{{sfn|Smith|2017|pp=384\u2013389}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cattle in religion and mythology]]\n* [[List of solar deities]]\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n==Works cited==\n{{refbegin|40em}}\n* {{cite book | last=Assmann | first=Jan |authorlink=Jan Assmann |others= Translated by David Lorton | title=Death and Salvation in Ancient Egypt |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rL2y0T6ukuYC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false | publisher= Cornell University Press | year =2005 |origyear= German edition 2001 | isbn = 978-0801442414 | ref = harv}}\n* {{cite journal |author-last=Billing |author-first=Nils |title=Writing an Image: The Formulation of the Tree Goddess Motif in the Book of the Dead, Ch. 59 |journal=[[Studien zur Alt\u00e4gyptischen Kultur]] |volume=32 |pages=35\u201350 |date=2004 |jstor=25152905 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Bleeker |first=C.
