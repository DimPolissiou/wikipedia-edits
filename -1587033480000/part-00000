Because of range expansion, the American mink is classed as a [[least-concern species]] by the [[IUCN]].<ref name=\"iucn\"/> Since the extinction of the [[sea mink]], the American mink is the only extant member of the [[genus]] ''Neovison''. The American mink is a [[carnivore]] that feeds on rodents, fish, crustaceans, frogs, and birds. In its [[Introduced species|introduced]] range in Europe it has been classified as an [[invasive species]] linked to declines in [[European mink]], [[Pyrenean desman]], and [[European water vole|water vole]] populations.

The winter fur's tone is generally very dark blackish-tawny to light-tawny. Colour is evenly distributed over all the body, with the under side being only slightly lighter than the back. The [[guard hair]]s are bright and dark-tawny, often approaching black on the spine. The underfur on the back is very wavy and greyish-tawny with a bluish tint. The tail is darker than the trunk and sometimes becomes pure black on the tip. The chin and lower lip are white. Captive individuals tend to develop irregular white patches on the lower surface of their bodies, though escaped individuals from [[Tartaria]] gradually lost these patches. The summer fur is generally shorter, sparser and duller than the winter fur.<ref name=\"s1392\"/> The thick underfur and oily guard hairs render the pelage water-resistant, with the length of the guard hairs being intermediate between those of [[otter]]s and [[European polecat|polecats]], thus indicating the American mink is incompletely adapted to an aquatic life. It [[moulting|moults]] twice a year, during spring and autumn.<ref name=\"f663\"/> It does not turn white in winter.<ref name=\"s873\">{{Harvnb|Seton|1909|p=873}}</ref> A variety of different colour mutations have arisen from experimental breeding on fur farms.<ref name=\"h488\"/>\n\n===Locomotion===\nOn land, the American mink moves by a bounding gait, with speeds of up to {{convert|6.5|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. It also climbs trees and swims well.<ref name=\"h489\"/> During swimming, the mink propels itself primarily through undulating movements of the trunk. When [[Underwater diving|diving]], it undergoes [[bradycardia]], which is likely an adaptation to conserve [[oxygen]].<ref name=\"f663\"/> In warm water ({{convert|24|C|F}}), the American mink can swim for three hours without stopping, but in cold water it can die within 27 minutes.<ref name=\"s1410\">{{Harvnb|Heptner|Sludskii|2002|pp=1410\u20131411}}</ref> It generally dives to depths of {{convert|30|cm|in|order=flip|abbr=on}} for 10 seconds, though depths of 3 m lasting 60 seconds have been recorded. It typically catches fish after five- to 20-second chases.<ref name=\"h489\"/>\n\n===Senses and scent glands===\nThe American mink relies heavily on [[Visual perception|sight]] when foraging. Its [[eyesight]] is clearer on land than underwater. Its [[auditory perception]] is high enough to detect the [[ultrasonics|ultrasonic]] vocalisations (1\u201316 [[kHz]]) of rodent prey. Its sense of smell is comparatively weak. Its two [[anal gland]]s are used for [[scent marking]], either through defecation or by rubbing the anal region on the ground. The secretions of the anal glands are composed of 2,2-[[dimethyl]][[thietane]], 2-[[ethyl group|ethylthietane]], cyclic [[disulfide]], 3,3-dimethyl-1,2-dithiacyclopentane, and [[indole]]. When stressed, the American mink can expel the contents of its anal glands at a distance of {{convert|30|cm|in|0|order=flip|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"f663\"/> Scent glands may also be located on the throat and chest.<ref name=\"h491\">{{Harvnb|Harris|Yalden|2008|p=491}}</ref> The smell produced by these scent glands was described by [[Clinton Hart Merriam]] as more unbearable than that produced by [[skunk]]s, and added it was \"one of the few substances, of animal, vegetable, or mineral origin, that has, on land or sea, rendered me aware of the existence of the abominable sensation called [[nausea]]\".<ref name=\"m67\">{{Harvnb|Merriam|1886|p=67}}</ref>\n\n==Behaviour==\n\n===Social and territorial behaviours===\n[[File:Angrylouisianamink.png|thumb|left|A southern mink (''N. v. vulgivagus'') in a threatening posture]]\n[[File:Slick Mink.jpg|200 px|thumb|American mink emerges from a pond.]]\nAmerican mink territories are held by individual animals with minimal intrasex overlap, but with extensive overlap between animals of the opposite sex. Most territories are in undisturbed, rocky coastal habitats with broad [[littoral zone]]s and dense cover. Some are on estuaries, rivers and canals near urban areas. Home ranges are typically {{convert|1|\u2013|6|km|mi|abbr=off}} long, with male territories larger than females'.<ref name=\"h489\"/> As long as it is close to water, the American mink is not fussy about its choice of den. Mink dens typically consist of long burrows in [[river bank]]s, holes under [[Wooden log|log]]s, [[tree stump]]s, or [[root]]s and hollow [[tree]]s, though dens located in rock crevices, drains, and nooks under stone piles and bridges are occasionally selected. The burrows they dig themselves are typically about four inches in diameter and may continue along for {{convert|10|\u2013|12|ft|cm}} at a depth of {{convert|2|\u2013|3|ft|cm}}. The American mink may nest in burrows dug previously by [[muskrat]]s, [[badger]]s and [[skunk]]s, and may also dig dens in old [[ant hill]]s. The nesting chamber is at the end of a four-inch tunnel, and is about a foot in diameter. It is warm, dry, and lined with straw and feathers.<ref name=\"s879\">{{Harvnb|Seton|1909|pp=879\u2013880}}</ref> The American mink's dens are characterized by a large number of entrances and twisting passages. The number of exits varies from one to eight.<ref name=\"s1410\"/>\n\nThe American mink normally only vocalises during close encounters with other minks or predators. The sounds it emits include piercing shrieks and hisses when threatened and muffled chuckling sounds when mating. Kits squeak repeatedly when separated from their mothers.<ref name=\"h491\"/> [[Ernest Thompson Seton]] reported hearing minks growl and snarl when confronting a threat.<ref name=\"s877\">{{Harvnb|Seton|1909|p=877}}</ref> During aggressive interactions, this mink asserts its dominance by arching its back, puffing up, and lashing its tail, stamping and scraping the ground with its feet, and opening its mouth in a threat-gape.

The mating process is violent, with the male typically biting the female on the nape of the neck and pinning her with his forefeet. [[Mating]] lasts from 10 minutes to four hours. Females are receptive for seven- to 10-day intervals during the three-week breeding season, and can mate with multiple males. Along with the [[striped skunk]], the American mink is among the only mammals to mate in spring that have a short delay before implantation. This [[delayed implantation]] allows pregnant minks to keep track of environmental conditions and select an ideal time and place for [[parturition]].<ref name=\"f663\"/>\n\nThe [[gestation period]] lasts from 40 to 75 days, with actual embryonic development taking place after 30\u201332 days, indicating implantation delay can last from eight to 45 days.

Maximum heaviness occurs in autumn.<ref name=\"s1397\">{{Harvnb|Heptner|Sludskii|2002|pp=1397\u20131399}}</ref>\n[[File:Minkpaws.png|thumb|150 px|American mink paws, as illustrated by [[Ernest Thompson Seton]]]]\n\n===Fur===\nThe American mink's winter fur is denser, longer, softer, and more close-fitting than that of the European mink. The winter fur's tone is generally very dark blackish-tawny to light-tawny. Colour is evenly distributed over all the body, with the under side being only slightly lighter than the back. The [[guard hair]]s are bright and dark-tawny, often approaching black on the spine. The underfur on the back is very wavy and greyish-tawny with a bluish tint. The tail is darker than the trunk and sometimes becomes pure black on the tip. The chin and lower lip are white. Captive individuals tend to develop irregular white patches on the lower surface of their bodies, though escaped individuals from [[Tartaria]] gradually lost these patches. The summer fur is generally shorter, sparser and duller than the winter fur.<ref name=\"s1392\"/> The thick underfur and oily guard hairs render the pelage water-resistant, with the length of the guard hairs being intermediate between those of [[otter]]s and [[European polecat|polecats]], thus indicating the American mink is incompletely adapted to an aquatic life. It [[moulting|moults]] twice a year, during spring and autumn.<ref name=\"f663\"/> It does not turn white in winter.<ref name=\"s873\">{{Harvnb|Seton|1909|p=873}}</ref> A variety of different colour mutations have arisen from experimental breeding on fur farms.<ref name=\"h488\"/>\n\n===Locomotion===\nOn land, the American mink moves by a bounding gait, with speeds of up to {{convert|6.5|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. It also climbs trees and swims well.<ref name=\"h489\"/> During swimming, the mink propels itself primarily through undulating movements of the trunk. When [[Underwater diving|diving]], it undergoes [[bradycardia]], which is likely an adaptation to conserve [[oxygen]].<ref name=\"f663\"/> In warm water ({{convert|24|C|F}}), the American mink can swim for three hours without stopping, but in cold water it can die within 27 minutes.<ref name=\"s1410\">{{Harvnb|Heptner|Sludskii|2002|pp=1410\u20131411}}</ref> It generally dives to depths of {{convert|30|cm|in|order=flip|abbr=on}} for 10 seconds, though depths of 3 m lasting 60 seconds have been recorded. It typically catches fish after five- to 20-second chases.<ref name=\"h489\"/>\n\n===Senses and scent glands===\nThe American mink relies heavily on [[Visual perception|sight]] when foraging. Its [[eyesight]] is clearer on land than underwater. Its [[auditory perception]] is high enough to detect the [[ultrasonics|ultrasonic]] vocalisations (1\u201316 [[kHz]]) of rodent prey. Its sense of smell is comparatively weak. Its two [[anal gland]]s are used for [[scent marking]], either through defecation or by rubbing the anal region on the ground. The secretions of the anal glands are composed of 2,2-[[dimethyl]][[thietane]], 2-[[ethyl group|ethylthietane]], cyclic [[disulfide]], 3,3-dimethyl-1,2-dithiacyclopentane, and [[indole]]. When stressed, the American mink can expel the contents of its anal glands at a distance of {{convert|30|cm|in|0|order=flip|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"f663\"/> Scent glands may also be located on the throat and chest.<ref name=\"h491\">{{Harvnb|Harris|Yalden|2008|p=491}}</ref> The smell produced by these scent glands was described by [[Clinton Hart Merriam]] as more unbearable than that produced by [[skunk]]s, and added it was \"one of the few substances, of animal, vegetable, or mineral origin, that has, on land or sea, rendered me aware of the existence of the abominable sensation called [[nausea]]\".<ref name=\"m67\">{{Harvnb|Merriam|1886|p=67}}</ref>\n\n==Behaviour==\n\n===Social and territorial behaviours===\n[[File:Angrylouisianamink.png|thumb|left|A southern mink (''N. v. vulgivagus'') in a threatening posture]]\n[[File:Slick Mink.jpg|200 px|thumb|American mink emerges from a pond.]]\nAmerican mink territories are held by individual animals with minimal intrasex overlap, but with extensive overlap between animals of the opposite sex. Most territories are in undisturbed, rocky coastal habitats with broad [[littoral zone]]s and dense cover. Some are on estuaries, rivers and canals near urban areas. Home ranges are typically {{convert|1|\u2013|6|km|mi|abbr=off}} long, with male territories larger than females'.<ref name=\"h489\"/> As long as it is close to water, the American mink is not fussy about its choice of den. Mink dens typically consist of long burrows in [[river bank]]s, holes under [[Wooden log|log]]s, [[tree stump]]s, or [[root]]s and hollow [[tree]]s, though dens located in rock crevices, drains, and nooks under stone piles and bridges are occasionally selected. The burrows they dig themselves are typically about four inches in diameter and may continue along for {{convert|10|\u2013|12|ft|cm}} at a depth of {{convert|2|\u2013|3|ft|cm}}. The American mink may nest in burrows dug previously by [[muskrat]]s, [[badger]]s and [[skunk]]s, and may also dig dens in old [[ant hill]]s. The nesting chamber is at the end of a four-inch tunnel, and is about a foot in diameter. It is warm, dry, and lined with straw and feathers.<ref name=\"s879\">{{Harvnb|Seton|1909|pp=879\u2013880}}</ref> The American mink's dens are characterized by a large number of entrances and twisting passages. The number of exits varies from one to eight.<ref name=\"s1410\"/>\n\nThe American mink normally only vocalises during close encounters with other minks or predators. The sounds it emits include piercing shrieks and hisses when threatened and muffled chuckling sounds when mating. Kits squeak repeatedly when separated from their mothers.<ref name=\"h491\"/> [[Ernest Thompson Seton]] reported hearing minks growl and snarl when confronting a threat.<ref name=\"s877\">{{Harvnb|Seton|1909|p=877}}</ref> During aggressive interactions, this mink asserts its dominance by arching its back, puffing up, and lashing its tail, stamping and scraping the ground with its feet, and opening its mouth in a threat-gape.

The mating process is violent, with the male typically biting the female on the nape of the neck and pinning her with his forefeet. [[Mating]] lasts from 10 minutes to four hours. Females are receptive for seven- to 10-day intervals during the three-week breeding season, and can mate with multiple males. Along with the [[striped skunk]], the American mink is among the only mammals to mate in spring that have a short delay before implantation. This [[delayed implantation]] allows pregnant minks to keep track of environmental conditions and select an ideal time and place for [[parturition]].<ref name=\"f663\"/>\n\nThe [[gestation period]] lasts from 40 to 75 days, with actual embryonic development taking place after 30\u201332 days, indicating implantation delay can last from eight to 45 days. The young are born from April to June, in litters consisting of four kits on average.<ref name=\"f663\"/> The litters are often multiply sired.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Thom | first1 = Michael D. | display-authors = etal | year = 2004 | title = Female American mink, Mustela vison, mate multiply in a free-choice environment | url = http://atrium.lib.uoguelph.ca/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10214/4719/Thom%20et%20al.%202004.pdf?sequence=1 | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 67 | issue = 5| pages = 975\u2013984 | doi = 10.1016/j.anbehav.2003.09.008 }}</ref> Exceptionally large litters of 11 kits have been recorded in Tartaria and 16 in the United States.<ref name=\"s1413\"/> The kits are blind at birth, weighing six grams and possessing a short coat of fine, silver-white hairs.<ref name=\"f663\"/> The kits are dependent on their mother's milk, which contains 3.8% [[lipid]]s, 6.2% [[protein]], 4.6% [[lactose]] and 10.66% mineral salts.<ref name=\"s1413\"/> Their eyes open after 25 days, with [[weaning]] occurring after five weeks.

It kills [[vertebrate]] prey by biting the back of the head or neck, leaving [[canine teeth|canine]] puncture marks {{convert|9|-|11|mm|abbr=on}} apart.<ref name=\"h487\">{{Harvnb|Harris|Yalden|2008|p=487}}</ref> The American mink often kills birds, including larger species like [[seagull]]s and [[cormorant]]s, by drowning. In its natural range, fish are its primary prey. Although inferior to the [[North American river otter]] in hunting fish, [[John James Audubon|Audubon]] and [[John Bachman|Bachman]] once reported seeing a mink carrying a foot-long [[trout]]. A similar sighting was also confirmed in 2019 within the [[Cattaraugus Creek]], New York watershed. Mink inhabiting the [[prairie]] sloughs primarily target [[frog]]s, [[tadpole]]s, and [[mice]].<ref name=\"s883\">{{Harvnb|Seton|1909|pp=883\u2013884}}</ref> It is a formidable predator of [[muskrat]]s, which are chased underwater and killed in their own burrows. Among the rodents killed by the American mink in its native range are rats and mice of the [[genus|genera]] ''[[Hesperomys]]'', ''[[Microtus]]'', ''[[Sigmodon]]'', and ''[[Neotoma]]''. [[Marsh rabbit]]s are frequently taken in marshy or swampy tracts.<ref name=\"c178\">{{Harvnb|Coues|1877|p=178}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Tatarstan|Tartaria]], the American mink's most important food items are [[vole]]s, fish, crustaceans, frogs, and aquatic insects. In winter, aquatic foods predominate, while land-based prey increases in importance during the spring. Within the [[Altai Mountains]], the American mink feeds predominantly on mammals such as rodents, shrews, and moles, as well as birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish. Among the 11 different bird species preyed upon by minks in Altai are [[dipper]]s and [[pine grosbeak]]s. Among fish, small species predominate in the diet of minks in Altai, and include; [[minnow]]s, [[Gudgeon (fish)|gudgeon]]s, and wide-headed [[sculpin]]s. In the [[Sverdlovsk Oblast|Sverdlovsk]] and [[Irkutsk Oblast]]s, mouse-like rodents are their most important foods, followed by birds, fish and insects. In the [[Russian Far East]], where crustaceans are scarce, the American mink feeds extensively on [[amphipod]]s.<ref name=\"s1407\">{{Harvnb|Heptner|Sludskii|2002|pp=1407\u20131408}}</ref> In the [[British Isles]], dietary composition varies seasonally and regionally. [[European rabbit]]s are the most commonly taken prey in areas where they are common, especially in summer. A range of small rodents and insectivores are preyed upon, but to a lesser degree. [[European hare]]s are occasionally attacked. Minks in Britain prey on several bird species, with [[duck]]s, [[moorhen]]s, and [[coot]]s being most frequently targeted on lakes and rivers, while [[gull]]s are taken in coastal habitats. Marine species preyed upon in Britain include [[European eel]]s, rock-pool fish such as [[blenny]], [[shore crab]]s and [[crayfish]].<ref name=\"h492\">{{Harvnb|Harris|Yalden|2008|p=492}}</ref> American minks have been implicated in the decline of the [[European water vole|water vole]] in the United Kingdom and linked to the decline of waterfowl across their range in Europe.

Domestic mink are larger than wild mink, which may cause problems with the ecosystem when they escape. Minks are solitary, territorial animals and are intolerant of other minks. In times of overpopulation, they control their own numbers by either killing each other through direct conflict or by causing weaker minks to be driven from territory until starvation sets in.<ref name=Dunstone>Dunstone, N.

Mink [[scarf|scarves]] and [[Stole (vestment)|stole]]s are also manufactured.

They are harvested in late November and December.

By the 1921\u201322 season college hockey adopted the increasingly more common 6\u2013aside format with the abandonment of the second center/rover position and the two point men being renamed as 'defensemen'.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pHE9AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA587&lpg=PA587&dq=yale+adams+hockey+1904&source=bl&ots=oze36Q8R0l&sig=ACfU3U25_Z0x19u11JQOCshhFGn_h84hhw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiUiuDdnfzmAhXIs1kKHYo8DUoQ6AEwDXoECAwQAQ#v=onepage&q=yale%20adams%20hockey%201904&f=false |title=The H Book of Harvard Athletics 1852-1922 |work=Harvard University |accessdate=January 21, 2020}}</ref> The change from point men to defensemen comes as a result of an alignment change where instead of lining up one in front of the other, the two defensive players would play beside one another.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hockeyhistorysis.blogspot.com/2012/09/evolution-of-hockey-positions.html |title=Evolution of Hockey Positions  |work=Hockey Histories |accessdate=January 21, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe ice surfaces that the players played on were not of a uniform size. Rinks like the [[St. Nicholas Rink]] or [[Duquesne Gardens]] were few and far between and quite often teams would only be able to play on frozen ponds. Slightly more consistent were the length of games, however, there was no set game time. Most were played as two 20-minute halves but some games had 15- or 25-minute halves and others were one 40-minute period.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tech.mit.edu/archives/VOL_024/TECH_V024_S0200_P003.pdf |title=The Tech Vol. 24 No. 48 P. 3 |work=The Tech |date=February 15, 1905 |accessdate=January 21, 2020}}</ref> Occasionally games were not able to be played entirely at one time so the teams would arrange to meet at a later date to finish the match.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tech.mit.edu/V21/PDF/V21-N16.pdf |title=The Tech Vol. 21 N. 16 |work=The Tech |date=February 20, 1902 |accessdate=January 18, 2020}}</ref> Overtime after a tie did not always occur, as ice times at public skating rinks were constrained, but even when teams were able to play extra frames the rules were somewhat flexible; because there were no lights illuminating the ponds, games could only be played while the sun was shining and in the winter months dusk came quickly. The teams would attempt to finish the game with a winner decided but even after multiple overtimes ties did result.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/dartmouthsports.com/documents/2012/5/18/845640.pdf |title=Year-By-Year results |work=Dartmouth Big Green |accessdate=January 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Stabilizing the game===\n[[File:Harvard Stadium - 1910 Hockey (Hi-Res).jpg|thumb|right|200px|alt=Harvard Stadium circa 1910|The two rinks at Harvard Stadium]]\nFrom the start college hockey teams were rarely in a place of surety. In the 10 years since John's Hopkins' exit in 1898 at least a dozen teams were forced to cancel seasons or suspend their program entirely, including some of the more financially sound institutions like [[Cornell University]] and [[Brown University]]. The two main factors in this were interest from the student body and the lack of available or good ice. While the interest conundrum required a more nuanced solution, the ice troubles had a more tangible answer. Teams near to public skating rinks would be able to hold their games at venues where ice conditions could be ensured but at the start, with so few available, some programs came up with novel solutions. One such idea came from [[Harvard University]] who, after completing construction of their [[Harvard Stadium|football stadium]] in 1904, decided to erect two open-air rinks on the field for the team to use.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://d2o2figo6ddd0g.cloudfront.net/k/1/ky6ab0n88wjbyr/Timeline_of_Tradition.pdf |title=Timeline of Tradition |work=Harvard Crimson |accessdate=January 6, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAs rinks continued to be built in areas near to the colleges, specifically the [[Matthews Arena|Boston Arena]], [[New Haven Arena]] and [[Philadelphia Arena|Philadelphia Ice Palace]], college teams had more and more ice rinks available to them and with most using artificial ice the teams were no longer dependent on weather conditions. Owing to the popularity of the game the first on-campus, purpose-built arena was constructed by [[Princeton University]] in 1923.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.roamingtherinks.com/hobey-baker-memorial-rink |title=Hobey Baker Memorial Rink - Home of the Princeton University Tigers |work=Roaming the Rinks |accessdate=January 21, 2020}}</ref> Most schools were content with buying ice time from local rink operators while others simply didn't want to fund the building of their own version of the [[Hobey Baker Memorial Rink]]. As the weather warmed in the 1930s and 40s many of these teams would be forced to decide whether they were willing to financially support their ice hockey programs or not. [[Army Black Knights men's ice hockey|Army]], for instance, had [[Smith Rink]] built in 1930 while [[Cornell Big Red men's ice hockey|Cornell]] struggled with the ice on [[Ithaca, New York#Points of interest|Beebe Lake]] until after [[World War II]].\n\n===World War I aftermath===\nThe vast majority of teams ceased operating in 1917 after the [[United States]] entered [[World War I]]. This made sense as many of the students who would otherwise be playing had instead joined the military. Because the war ended in November 1918 most of the teams returned to the ice for the 1918\u201319 season and while the game continued to grow around [[New England]] an interesting development happened shortly after the armistice was signed.\n\nColleges in the [[Midwestern United States|midwest]] began their own ice hockey programs. At the beginning these were typically restricted to upper-echelon universities like the [[University of Minnesota]] or the [[University of Michigan]] but some of the smaller schools got into the game as well. From the [[Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference|MIAC]]'s foundation in 1920, member schools have played ice hockey<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.miacathletics.com/sports/mice/recordbook |title=MIAC Men's Hockey Recordbook |work=MIAC |accessdate=January 21, 2020}}</ref> and were able to establish the first consistent lower-tier competition in college hockey.\n\n===Surviving the Depression===\nWhile college ice hockey flourished in the 1920s the [[Great Depression]] did have an impact on the game in the '30s. Most schools that had established programs made the effort to keep their teams going but some less-acclaimed teams like [[Penn Quakers men's ice hockey|Pennsylvania]] or [[Columbia Lions|Columbia]] decided that ice hockey wasn't worth the cost. Some of the smaller schools like [[RPI Engineers men's ice hockey|Rensselaer]] had no choice but to suspend their programs as they did not have the resources that a [[Harvard University|Harvard]] or [[Yale University|Yale]] did. After the first half of the 1930s, however, the depression lessened and schools were able to found or restart their programs. The game continued to expand west with the addition of [[Gonzaga University|Gonzaga]], [[University of Southern California|USC]], [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] and others,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://gozags.com/news/2006/2/23/Gonzaga_s_Short_But_Rich_Hockey_History.aspx |title=Gonzaga's Short, But Rich Hockey History |work=Gonzaga Bulldogs |date=February 23, 2006 |accessdate=January 22, 2020}}</ref> however, none of the Pacific-coast teams would make it to the 1950s.\n\n===World War II hiatus===\nAs had happened during the first world war, the majority of universities suspended their ice hockey teams during [[World War II]]. Most of teams that were active just prior to the U.S.' entry played during the 1942\u201343 season but were mothballed afterwards. There were notable exceptions such as Yale and [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]], who continued to play through the duration of the war, but many teams returned to the ice for an abbreviated 1945\u201346 season. One benefit to college hockey that resulted from the war was the [[G.I. Bill]] which helped returning servicemen pay for a college education. With a much larger student body and a resulting influx in cash, colleges were more able to afford to support an ice hockey team.\n\n===NCAA Tournament===\nBy 1947 college ice hockey was still a regional sport, being localized in the northeast and northern Midwest (with a few exceptions) but despite the low number of teams playing, the NCAA finally instituted a national tournament. At the start the tournament invited two participants from the two regions: east and west. The east region was loosely defined as any college east of the [[Pennsylvania]]-[[Ohio]] border with all other teams being lumped into the west region. The tournament was held at the [[Broadmoor World Arena (1938)|Broadmoor World Arena]] for the first ten years. Partially due to a lack of competition, [[Michigan Wolverines men's ice hockey|Michigan]] was invited to participate in each of the first ten tournaments and won six [[List of NCAA Division I men's ice hockey champions|National Championships]] in that time.<ref>{{cite web|title=All-Time Championship Tournament records and results|url=http://web1.ncaa.org/web_files/stats/m_ice_hockey_champs_records/2008/d1/D1champs.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]|accessdate=2009-02-23}}</ref>\n<!---\nOne sizeable result of the NCAA tournament was that teams who wanted to participate would have to meet NCAA guidelines for several aspects of their teams. These rules included the amount of financial aid any one student could receive, whether or not the student was eligible due to pro/amateur status and restricted the number of years a student could be on the varsity team to three. The three-year varsity rule was only applied to NCAA Tournament games, meaning that the teams could play four-year lettermen in as many games as they wanted to but those players would not be allowed to participate in the Tournament. This specific case caused an undefeated [[Clarkson Golden Knights men's ice hockey|Clarkson]] team to decline the invitation to the [[1956 NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Tournament|1956]]--->\n\n==NCAA==\n{{Main|List of NCAA ice hockey programs}}\n[[File:BGvMIhky.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bowling Green Falcons men's ice hockey|Bowling Green]] vs. [[Michigan Wolverines men's ice hockey|Michigan]] hockey game]]\n\nThe National Collegiate Athletic Association has conducted national championships for men's ice hockey since 1948, and women's ice hockey since 2001.\n\nU.S. college hockey players must be deemed eligible for NCAA competition by the NCAA Eligibility Center, a process that examines a student-athlete's academic qualifications and amateur status.

The winner of each regional advances to the Frozen Four to compete for the national championship. For many years, 5 teams earned automatic bids through winning conference tournament championships, while 11 earned at-large berths through a selection committee. With the addition of the Big Ten Hockey Conference for the 2013\u201314 season, the tournament now features 6 automatic qualifiers, and 10 at-large bids. The ranking system that is used to determine the at-large teams is known as the Pairwise Rankings, which uses a number of ranking factors to create a scoring system for all NCAA Division I teams.\n[[File:Hockey d1.png|thumb|A map of all NCAA Division I men's hockey teams.]]\n\nIn 2015\u201316, there were 60 schools competing in Division I, with 59 of them organized into six conferences, plus one team ([[Arizona State Sun Devils men's ice hockey|Arizona State]]) playing as an independent program with no conference affiliation.

On a faceoff players were typically arranged as either four [[Forward (ice hockey)|forwards]], two [[Defenceman|point men]] and one [[goaltender]] or three [[Forward (ice hockey)|forwards]], one [[Rover (ice hockey)|rover]] two [[Defenceman|point men]] and one [[goaltender]].\n\nIn the four forward setup the players were arranged from a faceoff as a left and right wing on the outside and a left and right center on the inside. The two point men and goaltender were typically arrayed in a line from center ice to the goal as coverpoint, point and goaltender. If viewed from above the players would form a ' T '.\n\nIf a rover was used instead there would only be one center. The rover would line up either in a defensive or offensive position depending on the need. The remaining five positions would be unchanged. By the 1921\u201322 season college hockey adopted the increasingly more common 6\u2013aside format with the abandonment of the second center/rover position and the two point men being renamed as 'defensemen'.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pHE9AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA587&lpg=PA587&dq=yale+adams+hockey+1904&source=bl&ots=oze36Q8R0l&sig=ACfU3U25_Z0x19u11JQOCshhFGn_h84hhw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiUiuDdnfzmAhXIs1kKHYo8DUoQ6AEwDXoECAwQAQ#v=onepage&q=yale%20adams%20hockey%201904&f=false |title=The H Book of Harvard Athletics 1852-1922 |work=Harvard University |accessdate=January 21, 2020}}</ref> The change from point men to defensemen comes as a result of an alignment change where instead of lining up one in front of the other, the two defensive players would play beside one another.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hockeyhistorysis.blogspot.com/2012/09/evolution-of-hockey-positions.html |title=Evolution of Hockey Positions  |work=Hockey Histories |accessdate=January 21, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe ice surfaces that the players played on were not of a uniform size. Rinks like the [[St. Nicholas Rink]] or [[Duquesne Gardens]] were few and far between and quite often teams would only be able to play on frozen ponds. Slightly more consistent were the length of games, however, there was no set game time. Most were played as two 20-minute halves but some games had 15- or 25-minute halves and others were one 40-minute period.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tech.mit.edu/archives/VOL_024/TECH_V024_S0200_P003.pdf |title=The Tech Vol. 24 No. 48 P. 3 |work=The Tech |date=February 15, 1905 |accessdate=January 21, 2020}}</ref> Occasionally games were not able to be played entirely at one time so the teams would arrange to meet at a later date to finish the match.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tech.mit.edu/V21/PDF/V21-N16.pdf |title=The Tech Vol. 21 N. 16 |work=The Tech |date=February 20, 1902 |accessdate=January 18, 2020}}</ref> Overtime after a tie did not always occur, as ice times at public skating rinks were constrained, but even when teams were able to play extra frames the rules were somewhat flexible; because there were no lights illuminating the ponds, games could only be played while the sun was shining and in the winter months dusk came quickly. The teams would attempt to finish the game with a winner decided but even after multiple overtimes ties did result.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/dartmouthsports.com/documents/2012/5/18/845640.pdf |title=Year-By-Year results |work=Dartmouth Big Green |accessdate=January 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Stabilizing the game===\n[[File:Harvard Stadium - 1910 Hockey (Hi-Res).jpg|thumb|right|200px|alt=Harvard Stadium circa 1910|The two rinks at Harvard Stadium]]\nFrom the start college hockey teams were rarely in a place of surety. In the 10 years since John's Hopkins' exit in 1898 at least a dozen teams were forced to cancel seasons or suspend their program entirely, including some of the more financially sound institutions like [[Cornell University]] and [[Brown University]]. The two main factors in this were interest from the student body and the lack of available or good ice. While the interest conundrum required a more nuanced solution, the ice troubles had a more tangible answer. Teams near to public skating rinks would be able to hold their games at venues where ice conditions could be ensured but at the start, with so few available, some programs came up with novel solutions. One such idea came from [[Harvard University]] who, after completing construction of their [[Harvard Stadium|football stadium]] in 1904, decided to erect two open-air rinks on the field for the team to use.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://d2o2figo6ddd0g.cloudfront.net/k/1/ky6ab0n88wjbyr/Timeline_of_Tradition.pdf |title=Timeline of Tradition |work=Harvard Crimson |accessdate=January 6, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAs rinks continued to be built in areas near to the colleges, specifically the [[Matthews Arena|Boston Arena]], [[New Haven Arena]] and [[Philadelphia Arena|Philadelphia Ice Palace]], college teams had more and more ice rinks available to them and with most using artificial ice the teams were no longer dependent on weather conditions. Owing to the popularity of the game the first on-campus, purpose-built arena was constructed by [[Princeton University]] in 1923.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.roamingtherinks.com/hobey-baker-memorial-rink |title=Hobey Baker Memorial Rink - Home of the Princeton University Tigers |work=Roaming the Rinks |accessdate=January 21, 2020}}</ref> Most schools were content with buying ice time from local rink operators while others simply didn't want to fund the building of their own version of the [[Hobey Baker Memorial Rink]]. As the weather warmed in the 1930s and 40s many of these teams would be forced to decide whether they were willing to financially support their ice hockey programs or not. [[Army Black Knights men's ice hockey|Army]], for instance, had [[Smith Rink]] built in 1930 while [[Cornell Big Red men's ice hockey|Cornell]] struggled with the ice on [[Ithaca, New York#Points of interest|Beebe Lake]] until after [[World War II]].\n\n===World War I aftermath===\nThe vast majority of teams ceased operating in 1917 after the [[United States]] entered [[World War I]]. This made sense as many of the students who would otherwise be playing had instead joined the military. Because the war ended in November 1918 most of the teams returned to the ice for the 1918\u201319 season and while the game continued to grow around [[New England]] an interesting development happened shortly after the armistice was signed.\n\nColleges in the [[Midwestern United States|midwest]] began their own ice hockey programs. At the beginning these were typically restricted to upper-echelon universities like the [[University of Minnesota]] or the [[University of Michigan]] but some of the smaller schools got into the game as well. From the [[Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference|MIAC]]'s foundation in 1920, member schools have played ice hockey<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.miacathletics.com/sports/mice/recordbook |title=MIAC Men's Hockey Recordbook |work=MIAC |accessdate=January 21, 2020}}</ref> and were able to establish the first consistent lower-tier competition in college hockey.\n\n===Surviving the Depression===\nWhile college ice hockey flourished in the 1920s the [[Great Depression]] did have an impact on the game in the '30s. Most schools that had established programs made the effort to keep their teams going but some less-acclaimed teams like [[Penn Quakers men's ice hockey|Pennsylvania]] or [[Columbia Lions|Columbia]] decided that ice hockey wasn't worth the cost. Some of the smaller schools like [[RPI Engineers men's ice hockey|Rensselaer]] had no choice but to suspend their programs as they did not have the resources that a [[Harvard University|Harvard]] or [[Yale University|Yale]] did. After the first half of the 1930s, however, the depression lessened and schools were able to found or restart their programs. The game continued to expand west with the addition of [[Gonzaga University|Gonzaga]], [[University of Southern California|USC]], [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] and others,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://gozags.com/news/2006/2/23/Gonzaga_s_Short_But_Rich_Hockey_History.aspx |title=Gonzaga's Short, But Rich Hockey History |work=Gonzaga Bulldogs |date=February 23, 2006 |accessdate=January 22, 2020}}</ref> however, none of the Pacific-coast teams would make it to the 1950s.\n\n===World War II hiatus===\nAs had happened during the first world war, the majority of universities suspended their ice hockey teams during [[World War II]]. Most of teams that were active just prior to the U.S.' entry played during the 1942\u201343 season but were mothballed afterwards. There were notable exceptions such as Yale and [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]], who continued to play through the duration of the war, but many teams returned to the ice for an abbreviated 1945\u201346 season. One benefit to college hockey that resulted from the war was the [[G.I. Bill]] which helped returning servicemen pay for a college education. With a much larger student body and a resulting influx in cash, colleges were more able to afford to support an ice hockey team.\n\n===NCAA Tournament===\nBy 1947 college ice hockey was still a regional sport, being localized in the northeast and northern Midwest (with a few exceptions) but despite the low number of teams playing, the NCAA finally instituted a national tournament. At the start the tournament invited two participants from the two regions: east and west. The east region was loosely defined as any college east of the [[Pennsylvania]]-[[Ohio]] border with all other teams being lumped into the west region. The tournament was held at the [[Broadmoor World Arena (1938)|Broadmoor World Arena]] for the first ten years. Partially due to a lack of competition, [[Michigan Wolverines men's ice hockey|Michigan]] was invited to participate in each of the first ten tournaments and won six [[List of NCAA Division I men's ice hockey champions|National Championships]] in that time.<ref>{{cite web|title=All-Time Championship Tournament records and results|url=http://web1.ncaa.org/web_files/stats/m_ice_hockey_champs_records/2008/d1/D1champs.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]|accessdate=2009-02-23}}</ref>\n<!---\nOne sizeable result of the NCAA tournament was that teams who wanted to participate would have to meet NCAA guidelines for several aspects of their teams. These rules included the amount of financial aid any one student could receive, whether or not the student was eligible due to pro/amateur status and restricted the number of years a student could be on the varsity team to three. The three-year varsity rule was only applied to NCAA Tournament games, meaning that the teams could play four-year lettermen in as many games as they wanted to but those players would not be allowed to participate in the Tournament.

Twenty-one schools are Division II or III athletic programs that \"play up\" to Division I in hockey, and 16 schools that are full Division I members are in the [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|Football Bowl Subdivision]], six of which compete in the [[Big Ten Conference]].\n\nThe [[NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship|NCAA Division I Championship]] is a 16-team, single-elimination tournament, divided into four, 4-team regional tournaments. The winner of each regional advances to the Frozen Four to compete for the national championship. For many years, 5 teams earned automatic bids through winning conference tournament championships, while 11 earned at-large berths through a selection committee. With the addition of the Big Ten Hockey Conference for the 2013\u201314 season, the tournament now features 6 automatic qualifiers, and 10 at-large bids. The ranking system that is used to determine the at-large teams is known as the Pairwise Rankings, which uses a number of ranking factors to create a scoring system for all NCAA Division I teams.\n[[File:Hockey d1.png|thumb|A map of all NCAA Division I men's hockey teams.]]\n\nIn 2015\u201316, there were 60 schools competing in Division I, with 59 of them organized into six conferences, plus one team ([[Arizona State Sun Devils men's ice hockey|Arizona State]]) playing as an independent program with no conference affiliation.

The [[Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference]] sponsored D-I men's hockey, but dropped the sport in 2003.\n\nThe [[Hobey Baker Memorial Award]] honors the top player in men's Division I hockey. The [[Mike Richter Award]] honors the top goaltender in Division I.\n\n====Division II====\nThe NCAA does not currently sponsor a championship in Division II, as there is only one conference that currently sponsors hockey, the [[Northeast-10 Conference]].

{"title_page": "P3M3", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{advert|date=November 2011}}\n{{Buzzword|date=July 2011}}\n}}\n\n'''P3M3''' (also known as the '''Portfolio, Programme and Project Management Maturity Model''') is a management maturity model looking across an organization at how it delivers its projects, programmes and portfolio(s). P3M3 is unique in that it looks at the whole system and not just at the processes.<ref>{{cite web|title=What is P3M3\u00ae?|url=https://www.axelos.com/best-practice-solutions/p3m3/what-is-p3m3/|publisher=AXELOS|accessdate=7 December 2016}}</ref>  The hierarchical approach enables organisations to assess their current capability and then plot a roadmap for improvement prioritised by those KPAs which will make the biggest impact on performance.\n\n== Context ==\nP3M3 is owned by [[Axelos]], a joint venture between the UK Government and Capita which took ownership of the materials in Jan 2014. Prior to this, P3M3 was owned by the [[Office of Government Commerce]] (OGC), a department within the [[UK Government]] with a remit to help public sector organisations improve their efficiency, gain better value for money from procurements and deliver improved success from programmes and projects.\n\nThe P3M3 aims to provide an assessment and measurement score for the portfolio, programme and project-related activities within process areas that contribute to achieving a successful project outcome. The levels described within the P3M3 indicate how key process areas can be structured hierarchically to define a progression of capability which an organisation can use to set goals and plan their improvement journey.\n\nThere have been 3 versions of P3M3\nVersion 1 was issued in 2005 - this model worked on the basis that organisational maturity started with project management, then moved to programme management with portfolio management maturity coming at the highest level off maturity\nVersion 2 was released in 2008 - this version included the 7 Perspectives and created a model which recognised that project, programme and portfolio maturity were not incremental and enabled the assessment of each model independently.\nVersion 3 was released in 2015 - this version provided for deeper analysis and diagnostics by the inclusion of Threads, which run through each of the Perspectives. \n\nThe levels facilitate organisational transitions from an immature state to become a mature and capable organisation with an objective basis for judging quality and solving programme and project issues.\n\nP3M3 assessments can be applied both to portfolio, programme and/or project management activities being carried out  across an organisation.\n\nP3M3 is made up of 3 models, which can be assessed individually or as a group:\n1. Project Management\n2. Programme Management\n3. Portfolio Management \n\nFor each of the models, P3M3 reviews the maturity and performance against 7 perspectives:\n\n1. Organisational Governance\n2. Benefits and/or Requirements Management \n3. Financial Controls\n4. Risk Management \n5. Stakeholder Management\n6. Resource Management \n7. Management Controls \n\nIn 2015 the concept of Threads was added to enable better diagnostics, these apply to all perspectives:\n1. Assurance\n2. Asset Management (optional)\n3. Behaviours\n4. Commercial sell (optional)\n5. Commercial buy (optional)\n6. Information and knowledge management \n7. Infrastructure and tools\n8. Planning\n9. Organisation\n10. Techniques\n11. Process \n13. Model integration\n\n== Assessments ==\n\nCompanies and organisations can utilise the P3M3 model via materials available on the Axelos web-site on a self-assessment basis.  The assessment itself provides a measure which indicates maturity.  Being assessed provides useful business information, but does not provide an award or accreditation to the business being assessed.

P3M3 is unique in that it looks at the whole system and not just at the processes.<ref>{{cite web|title=What is P3M3\u00ae?|url=https://www.axelos.com/best-practice-solutions/p3m3/what-is-p3m3/|publisher=AXELOS|accessdate=7 December 2016}}</ref>  The hierarchical approach enables organisations to assess their current capability and then plot a roadmap for improvement prioritised by those KPAs which will make the biggest impact on performance.\n\n== Context ==\nP3M3 is owned by [[Axelos]], a joint venture between the UK Government and Capita which took ownership of the materials in Jan 2014. Prior to this, P3M3 was owned by the [[Office of Government Commerce]] (OGC), a department within the [[UK Government]] with a remit to help public sector organisations improve their efficiency, gain better value for money from procurements and deliver improved success from programmes and projects.\n\nThe P3M3 aims to provide an assessment and measurement score for the portfolio, programme and project-related activities within process areas that contribute to achieving a successful project outcome. The levels described within the P3M3 indicate how key process areas can be structured hierarchically to define a progression of capability which an organisation can use to set goals and plan their improvement journey.\n\nThere have been 3 versions of P3M3\nVersion 1 was issued in 2005 - this model worked on the basis that organisational maturity started with project management, then moved to programme management with portfolio management maturity coming at the highest level off maturity\nVersion 2 was released in 2008 - this version included the 7 Perspectives and created a model which recognised that project, programme and portfolio maturity were not incremental and enabled the assessment of each model independently.\nVersion 3 was released in 2015 - this version provided for deeper analysis and diagnostics by the inclusion of Threads, which run through each of the Perspectives. \n\nThe levels facilitate organisational transitions from an immature state to become a mature and capable organisation with an objective basis for judging quality and solving programme and project issues.\n\nP3M3 assessments can be applied both to portfolio, programme and/or project management activities being carried out  across an organisation.\n\nP3M3 is made up of 3 models, which can be assessed individually or as a group:\n1. Project Management\n2. Programme Management\n3. Portfolio Management \n\nFor each of the models, P3M3 reviews the maturity and performance against 7 perspectives:\n\n1. Organisational Governance\n2. Benefits and/or Requirements Management \n3. Financial Controls\n4. Risk Management \n5. Stakeholder Management\n6. Resource Management \n7. Management Controls \n\nIn 2015 the concept of Threads was added to enable better diagnostics, these apply to all perspectives:\n1. Assurance\n2. Asset Management (optional)\n3. Behaviours\n4. Commercial sell (optional)\n5. Commercial buy (optional)\n6. Information and knowledge management \n7. Infrastructure and tools\n8. Planning\n9. Organisation\n10. Techniques\n11. Process \n13. Model integration\n\n== Assessments ==\n\nCompanies and organisations can utilise the P3M3 model via materials available on the Axelos web-site on a self-assessment basis.  The assessment itself provides a measure which indicates maturity.  Being assessed provides useful business information, but does not provide an award or accreditation to the business being assessed. See accreditation.\n\nThere is some advantage in having a third party carry out such assessments to ensure objectivity and impartiality.  Some hire an individual specialist to undertake the self-assessment on their behalf, or engage an accredited consultancy company to perform this as a service.\n\nP3M3 accredited consulting companies are usually able to offer a suite of assessments:\n*PRINCE2 Maturity Model(P2MM)\n*Project Management Maturity Model(PJM3)\n*Programme  Management Maturity Model(PGM3)\n*Portfolio Management Maturity Model(PFM3)\n\nLead author history\n*2008 Version 2 - Rod Sowden\n*2015 Version 3 - joint lead authors - Rod Sowden & Andy Murray\n\n== Accreditation ==\nThe accreditation scheme offered by Axelos is aimed at consulting companies, for such to become accredited in the provision of P3M3 assessments.\n\nUnlike other related methodologies such as PRINCE2 and MSP, Etc., there is not a similar accreditation for individual practitioners.

The archdiocese is a jurisdiction of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]]. As of 2015, there were over 120 parishes and eight monasteries in the four diocesan districts of the archdiocese.\n\n== Archbishop of Australia ==\n[[Archbishop Stylianos]] was the [[primate (bishop)|primate]] of the Greek Orthodox Church of Australia. He was appointed to the position in 1975. The archbishop was a theologian of international standing.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} He was the co-chairman of the official dialogue between the Roman Catholic and Orthodox churches. He won an award for poetry and wrote 16 collections. He died in 2019.<ref>[http://www.greekorthodox.org.au/?page_id=3678 Articles by Archbishop Stylianos]</ref> On 9 May 2019, his successor, Bishop [[Makarios Griniezakis|Makarios]], was elected by the Holy Synod of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarchate]] as Archbishop of Australia.<ref>https://greekcitytimes.com/2019/05/10/metropolitan-makarios-of-christoupolis-elected-as-the-new-archbishop-of-australia/</ref> Archbishop [[Makarios Griniezakis|Makarios]] was enthroned in front of thousands of faithful on 29 June 2019 at the Cathedral of the Annunciation of the [[Theotokos]].\n\n==History==\nThe first churches founded by Greek Orthodox in Australia were Holy Trinity in [[Surry Hills]], [[Sydney]] (1898), and Annunciation of the Theotokos in [[East Melbourne]] (1900). The first priest to serve the religious needs of the Greek Orthodox population in Sydney and Melbourne was Archimandrite Dorotheos Bakaliaros. In March 1924, the \"Metropolis of Australia and New Zealand\" was established under the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate]] to cover the expanding Greek population, which by 1927 numbered over 10,000 and had established churches in Sydney, [[Melbourne]], [[Brisbane]], [[Perth]] and [[Port Pirie]] in [[South Australia]]. The first metropolitan of the new province of the Ecumenical Patriarchate was [[Metropolitan Christoforos of Australia|Christoforos Knitis]] of Serres. In 1929, Metropolitan Christoforos returned to his homeland, [[Samos]]. He died on 7 August 1959.\n\nIn 1931, [[Timotheos Evangelinidis]] was elected as the second Metropolitan of Australia and New Zealand. He arrived in Australia on 28 January 1932 and presided over the church in Australia and New Zealand until 1947 when he was elected Metropolitan of Rhodes. On 22 April of that year, [[Theophylactos Papathanasopoulos]] was elected as the third metropolitan. On 2 August 1958, Metropolitan Theophylactos was killed in a car accident. In February 1959 the assistant bishop of the Archdiocese of America, Bishop [[Ezekiel Tsoukalas]] of Nazianzos, was elected Metropolitan of Australia. He arrived in Sydney on 27 April 1959.\n\nOn 1 September 1959, the Metropolis of Australia and New Zealand was elevated to an archdiocese and Metropolitan Ezekiel to an archbishop. Archbishop Ezekiel's episcopacy coincided with a period of great expansion in the numbers of Greek Orthodox in Australia through immigration, and many of the parishes that the church has today were formed under his guidance.

The archdiocese is a jurisdiction of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]]. As of 2015, there were over 120 parishes and eight monasteries in the four diocesan districts of the archdiocese.\n\n== Archbishop of Australia ==\n[[Archbishop Stylianos]] was the [[primate (bishop)|primate]] of the Greek Orthodox Church of Australia. He was appointed to the position in 1975. The archbishop was a theologian of international standing.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} He was the co-chairman of the official dialogue between the Roman Catholic and Orthodox churches. He won an award for poetry and wrote 16 collections. He died in 2019.<ref>[http://www.greekorthodox.org.au/?page_id=3678 Articles by Archbishop Stylianos]</ref> On 9 May 2019, his successor, Bishop [[Makarios Griniezakis|Makarios]], was elected by the Holy Synod of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarchate]] as Archbishop of Australia.<ref>https://greekcitytimes.com/2019/05/10/metropolitan-makarios-of-christoupolis-elected-as-the-new-archbishop-of-australia/</ref> Archbishop [[Makarios Griniezakis|Makarios]] was enthroned in front of thousands of faithful on 29 June 2019 at the Cathedral of the Annunciation of the [[Theotokos]].\n\n==History==\nThe first churches founded by Greek Orthodox in Australia were Holy Trinity in [[Surry Hills]], [[Sydney]] (1898), and Annunciation of the Theotokos in [[East Melbourne]] (1900). The first priest to serve the religious needs of the Greek Orthodox population in Sydney and Melbourne was Archimandrite Dorotheos Bakaliaros. In March 1924, the \"Metropolis of Australia and New Zealand\" was established under the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate]] to cover the expanding Greek population, which by 1927 numbered over 10,000 and had established churches in Sydney, [[Melbourne]], [[Brisbane]], [[Perth]] and [[Port Pirie]] in [[South Australia]]. The first metropolitan of the new province of the Ecumenical Patriarchate was [[Metropolitan Christoforos of Australia|Christoforos Knitis]] of Serres. In 1929, Metropolitan Christoforos returned to his homeland, [[Samos]]. He died on 7 August 1959.\n\nIn 1931, [[Timotheos Evangelinidis]] was elected as the second Metropolitan of Australia and New Zealand. He arrived in Australia on 28 January 1932 and presided over the church in Australia and New Zealand until 1947 when he was elected Metropolitan of Rhodes. On 22 April of that year, [[Theophylactos Papathanasopoulos]] was elected as the third metropolitan. On 2 August 1958, Metropolitan Theophylactos was killed in a car accident. In February 1959 the assistant bishop of the Archdiocese of America, Bishop [[Ezekiel Tsoukalas]] of Nazianzos, was elected Metropolitan of Australia. He arrived in Sydney on 27 April 1959.\n\nOn 1 September 1959, the Metropolis of Australia and New Zealand was elevated to an archdiocese and Metropolitan Ezekiel to an archbishop. Archbishop Ezekiel's episcopacy coincided with a period of great expansion in the numbers of Greek Orthodox in Australia through immigration, and many of the parishes that the church has today were formed under his guidance. In August 1974, the Holy and Sacred Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate elevated Archbishop Ezekiel to the titular see of Metropolitan of [[Pisidia]].<ref>{{cite book\n| last                  = Tamis\n| first                 = Anastasios\n| authorlink            = \n| title                 = The Greeks in Australia\n|trans-title=| url                   = \n| archiveurl            = \n| archivedate           = \n| accessdate            = \n| type                  = \n| edition               = \n| series                = \n| volume                = \n| date                  = \n| origyear              = \n| year                  = 2005\n| month                 = \n| publisher             = Cambridge University Press\n| location              = \n| language              = \n| isbn                  = 978-0-521-54743-7\n| page                  = 94\n| pages                 = \n| nopp                  = \n}}</ref> He died in [[Athens]] in July 1987.

The film's score and soundtrack is composed by [[Yuvan Shankar Raja]]. The film was released on 9 December 2016 to positive reviews and performed well at the box office.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Plot|film|date=March 2017}} <!-- as of this note, word count is 1118 words. per WP:FILMPLOT should be 400 to 700 words -->\nThe film starts with the narration of major events which get unfolded during the phase of eight years in [[Chennai]] and the current situation of their core members, their marriages, and their career growth. After a brief introduction the story later shifts to the present.\n\nThe major part of the story is Raghuvaran aka Raghu ([[Jai (actor)|Jai]]) and Anuradha's ([[Sana Althaf]]) marriage which is about to take place in Anu's native place in [[Theni]] district. Here they meet their old friend Aravind by chance whose local cricket team along with Oor Kaavalan ([[Mahat Raghavendra]]) and plays cricket against Maruthupandi aka Maruthu ([[Vaibhav Reddy|Vaibhav]])'s team. First they promise to play in an intoxicated stat and later refuse to play because of their wives. But, without any one's knowledge they play the semi-finals match and win the match.\n\nAfter the winning party, they come to know that Raghu had tied knot with Soppanasundari ([[Manisha Yadav]]), the girl who danced with them in the party, but before everyone knows that Raghu removes the Thali from her even without her knowledge. On the day of engagement, Gopi, Karthik, Pazhani, Ezhumalai, and Seenu come to know Maruthu had clicked a picture of Raghu and Soppanasundari, and he was the one who sent her to the party. He blackmails them to [[match fixing|lose the match]] against them. Except Aravind, everyone in the team comes to know about the picture in the middle of the match so everyone plays poorly and loses the match. Before the match gets over, the picture becomes viral. This is because Maruthu's friend Ganeshan (Abhinay Vaddi), who loves Anu from his childhood, wants to marry her, so he posts the picture in [[Facebook]] and WhatsApp.\n\nThe marriage gets stopped and the friends get separated. After a few days, Raghu was getting ready to move to Bangalore. The friends including the Rockers team members John ([[Inigo Prabakaran]]), Sundar (Jeeva), and Manohar Anna convince and promise Raghu that they will help him reunite with Anu. After lying to their wives, the friends team goes to Anu's village to convince her parents. There Raghu gets a shock about Anu's marriage engagement with Ganeshan. On the way, Raghu and his friends get into a fight with Maruthu and friends. The villagers gets angry on Raghu and his friends fearing they came to stop the marriage and they want them to go back to Chennai immediately. However, Aravind comes to their rescue and says everyone that they have come to play the tournament match, not to stop the marriage. At first, everyone including Raghu refuses to play the match. But, to convince Anu and family they accept to play the match in the name of Chennai Sharks. Raghu meets Anu in a temple and tells her that the photo is a fake one and she asks him to prove it. Raghu and his friends [[photo manipulation|edit the photo of every men]] in the village with some women and release it go viral. Anu gets convinced and warns Raghu that everyone is coming to the place where they are staying. Raghu asks her to meet him immediately. With the help of Anu's grandmother ([[Sachu]]) they meet in the ambulance, but Maruthu chases them.\n\nRaghu and his friends reach the police station, and Anu goes with her father. With the help of the sports minister ([[Shanmugasundaram]]), they reach safe to their shelter. The next day in the semi-finals, they play with Usilampatti Bad Boys with whom the Sharks have already played a bet match and lost Gopi's bat as bet but this time, the Sharks won the match and the bat returns to Gopi again.\n\nThe next day, Anu's family is moving to [[Tirupati|Tirupathi]] for her marriage.

The film's score and soundtrack is composed by [[Yuvan Shankar Raja]]. The film was released on 9 December 2016 to positive reviews and performed well at the box office.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Plot|film|date=March 2017}} <!-- as of this note, word count is 1118 words. per WP:FILMPLOT should be 400 to 700 words -->\nThe film starts with the narration of major events which get unfolded during the phase of eight years in [[Chennai]] and the current situation of their core members, their marriages, and their career growth.\n\nThe Sharks team is now coached and headed by Gopi ([[Vijay Vasanth]]), who trains the local guys to take forward the legacy of the team founded by his father in the late 80s. Now he owns a battery shop along with the mechanic shop as seen in the first film. He is married to Poonam ([[Anjena Kirti]]), a North Indian girl from [[Sowcarpet]].\n\nKarthik ([[Shiva (actor)|Shiva]]) owns a finance company provided the support from his brother Guna ([[Sampath Raj]]). Along with that Karthik also reviews films online. He is married to Selvi ([[Vijayalakshmi Ahathian|Vijayalakshmi]]), who is Pazhani's ([[Nithin Sathya]]) sister.\n\nPazhani had failed in police selection due to lack of height, but still hasn't given up plans to move abroad for better fortune. He is married to  Ezhumalai's ([[Ajay Raj]]) sister Uma (Krithika). She is more suspicious of her husband and ridicules him most of the time.\n\nEzhumalai now runs a travel service. He owns a couple of ambulances and his wife Stella (Maheswari Chanakyan) is a naive woman, who believes all of Ezhumalai's lies.\n\nSeenivasan aka Seenu ([[Premji Amaren]]) is still a bachelor who runs a supermarket and always want to enjoy the company of his friends, but they try to convince to get him married, so there wouldn\u2019t be a need for them to accompany him. The wives of the above-said team members oppose their husband\u2019s friendship with Seenu thinking he is one forcing their husbands to have drinking sessions and also wasting time. Imran (Ranjith) migrates to Mumbai, which is not heard of.\n\nShanmugham (Prasanna) is working in the U.S as a software engineer, and Udhay (Arun) has disappeared from the place. The young college student Karthik (Arivu), who is away from Chennai, remains in touch with his friends by phone.\n\nAravind ([[Arvind Akash]]) had eloped with a rich girl and had also stolen one and half lakh rupees kept as prize money for the cricket tournament and ran away with the girl. Somehow they manage to conduct the tournament but at the cost of some humiliations. Manohar Anna ([[Ilavarasu]]), the saloon owner still remains the same and proudly boasts that he is the manager of the Sharks team. After the introduction of all the team members there is a shift to the storyline.\n\nThe major part of the story is Raghuvaran aka Raghu ([[Jai (actor)|Jai]]) and Anuradha's ([[Sana Althaf]]) marriage which is about to take place in Anu's native place in [[Theni]] district. Here they meet their old friend Aravind by chance whose local cricket team along with Oor Kaavalan ([[Mahat Raghavendra]]) and plays cricket against Maruthupandi aka Maruthu ([[Vaibhav Reddy|Vaibhav]])'s team. First they promise to play in an intoxicated stat and later refuse to play because of their wives. But, without any one's knowledge they play the semi-finals match and win the match.\n\nAfter the winning party, they come to know that Raghu had tied knot with Soppanasundari ([[Manisha Yadav]]), the girl who danced with them in the party, but before everyone knows that Raghu removes the Thali from her even without her knowledge. On the day of engagement, Gopi, Karthik, Pazhani, Ezhumalai, and Seenu come to know Maruthu had clicked a picture of Raghu and Soppanasundari, and he was the one who sent her to the party. He blackmails them to [[match fixing|lose the match]] against them. Except Aravind, everyone in the team comes to know about the picture in the middle of the match so everyone plays poorly and loses the match. Before the match gets over, the picture becomes viral. This is because Maruthu's friend Ganeshan (Abhinay Vaddi), who loves Anu from his childhood, wants to marry her, so he posts the picture in [[Facebook]] and WhatsApp.\n\nThe marriage gets stopped and the friends get separated. After a few days, Raghu was getting ready to move to Bangalore. The friends including the Rockers team members John ([[Inigo Prabakaran]]), Sundar (Jeeva), and Manohar Anna convince and promise Raghu that they will help him reunite with Anu. After lying to their wives, the friends team goes to Anu's village to convince her parents. There Raghu gets a shock about Anu's marriage engagement with Ganeshan. On the way, Raghu and his friends get into a fight with Maruthu and friends. The villagers gets angry on Raghu and his friends fearing they came to stop the marriage and they want them to go back to Chennai immediately. However, Aravind comes to their rescue and says everyone that they have come to play the tournament match, not to stop the marriage. At first, everyone including Raghu refuses to play the match. But, to convince Anu and family they accept to play the match in the name of Chennai Sharks. Raghu meets Anu in a temple and tells her that the photo is a fake one and she asks him to prove it. Raghu and his friends [[photo manipulation|edit the photo of every men]] in the village with some women and release it go viral. Anu gets convinced and warns Raghu that everyone is coming to the place where they are staying. Raghu asks her to meet him immediately. With the help of Anu's grandmother ([[Sachu]]) they meet in the ambulance, but Maruthu chases them.\n\nRaghu and his friends reach the police station, and Anu goes with her father. With the help of the sports minister ([[Shanmugasundaram]]), they reach safe to their shelter. The next day in the semi-finals, they play with Usilampatti Bad Boys with whom the Sharks have already played a bet match and lost Gopi's bat as bet but this time, the Sharks won the match and the bat returns to Gopi again.\n\nThe next day, Anu's family is moving to [[Tirupati|Tirupathi]] for her marriage. At night before Anu family's, Raghu comes with his friends to elope with Anu but Maruthu comes. Next day after the toss Seenu calls Aravind and tells him to stay safe as because Raghu and Anu had eloped and married and they were returning to Chennai. Then it is revealed that Maruthu had helped Raghu to elope with Anu. \n\nDuring the Finals, it is shown that Aravind is left with no team members by his side except one local guy, it is followed by a hilarious scene where the Villagers including Anu's father Chase Aravind, One of the sharks team member asks when will aravind reform and grow into a responsible man, Seenu replies that it will be in the shown in the next part hinting a possible sequel.

In contrast, the name of the other Gothic people known from this period, the Greuthungi, may mean \"steppe-people\", with an etymology connected to a word for sand or gravel.

Svennung who believed that the Tervingi were Scadinavian \"ox people\".<ref name=\"Wolfram387n58\"/>\n\n==History==\n\n===Third century===\nThe Thervingi were possibly among the Goths who invaded the [[Roman Empire]] in the year 268.<ref>Also Eutropius (in ''Breviarium ab urbe condita'', 9, 8) cites 320.000 armed;</ref><ref>Santo Mazzarino.

However, the Goths were defeated in battle that summer near the modern [[Italy|Italian]]-[[Slovenia]]n border and then routed in the [[Battle of Naissus]] that September. Over the next three years they were driven back over the [[Danube River]] in a series of campaigns by the emperors [[Claudius II|Claudius II Gothicus]] and [[Aurelian]].\n\nIn the problematic [[Historia Augusta]] article for Emperor Claudius Gothicus (reigned 268-270), the following list of \"[[Scythian]]\" peoples is given who had been conquered by the emperor when he earned his title \"Gothicus\": \"''peuci trutungi austorgoti uirtingi sigy pedes celtae etiam eruli''\". These words are traditionally edited by modern to include well-known peoples: \"''[[Peuci]], Grutungi, Tervingi, Visi, Gipedes, [[Celts|Celtae]] etiam et [[Heruli|Eruli]]''\". This was therefore sometimes argued to be the first record of the Tervingi. However, apart from the reconstructions needed, historians today believe this document was made around 400, and thus 100 years later.<ref name=chr/>\n\nThe Thervingi, along with several other Gothic groups they are distinguished from, are first mentioned in a [[panegyric]] to the emperor [[Maximian]] (285\u2013305), delivered in or shortly after 291 (perhaps delivered at [[Trier]] on 20 April 292<ref>Guizot, I, 357.</ref>).<ref name=\"Wolfram24\">Wolfram, 24.</ref> It was traditionally ascribed to [[Claudius Mamertinus]].<ref>''Genethl. Max.'' 17, 1.</ref> \n\nThis panegyric can be interpreted in different way. After mentioning Moorish peoples fighting each other, it turns to Europe where two different conflicts are described in a way which makes it unclear which conflict the Tervingi were involved in: \"The Goths utterly destroy the [[Burgundians]], and again the [[Alamanni]] wear arms for the conquered, and the Tervingi too, another group of Goths, with the help of a band of [[Taifali]] join battle with the [[Vandals]] and [[Gepids]]\".<ref>{{citation|title=In Praise of Later Roman Emperors: The Panegyrici Latini |url=https://books.google.be/books?id=0WlC_UtU8M4C&lpg=PA101 |pages=100-101}}.

He wrote that the province of [[Dacia]] now (''nunc'') contained Taifali, Vicotali, and Tervingi. However, once again the texts which have survived have major variants: Terbingi, Tervulgi, Terviginti and \u03a4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b2\u03af\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 (Tervitai).<ref name=chr/> This would place the Tervingi near the [[Carpathians]], north of the Danube, which is consistent with what is known of the likely positions of the Taifali, Gepids and Vandals mentioned in the panegyric.\n\n===Fourth century===\nAccording to Jordanes, who does not mention the Tervingi, the Gothic ruler [[Ariaric]] was forced to sign a treaty with [[Constantine the Great]] in 332 after his son [[Constantine II (emperor)|Constantine II]] decisively defeated the Goths. After that time, substantial numbers of valuable Roman gold medallions was distributed in Gothic territories from [[Netherlands]] to [[Ukraine]], and have been discovered by archaeologists. They demonstrate the Roman influence among the Goths.<ref>Aleksander BURSCHE (2000), [https://www.academia.edu/13467247 Roman Gold Medallions in Barbaricum. Symbols of power and prestige of Germanic elite in Late Antiquity.]</ref>\n\nIn 367, the Roman Emperor [[Valens]] attacked the Thervingi north of the Danube river in retribution for their having supported the [[Procopius (usurper)|usurper Procopius]], who had died in 366. However, he was unable to hit them directly, because apparently the bulk of the Goths retreated to the ''Montes Serrorum'' (which is probably the south Carpathians). [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] says that Valens could not find anyone to fight with (''nullum inveniret quem superare poterat vel terrere'') and even implies that all of them fled, horror-struck, to the mountains (''omnes formidine perciti... montes petivere Serrorum''). In the following year, the flooding of the Danube prevented the Romans from crossing the river. \n\nIn 369, Valens finally penetrated deep into the Gothic territory, winning a series of skirmishes with Greuthungi, who are mentioned here for the first time in a classical record. [[Athanaric]] who was, in this passage, described by Ammianus as their most powerful judge \"''iudicem potentissimum''\" (implying he was a leader of the Greuthingi) was compelled to flee, and then make a peace agreement in the middle of the Danube, promising to never set foot on Roman soil.<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' book 27, chapter 5, 5-9; Further reading for this episode: Heather, Peter, 1996, ''The Goths'', Oxford, Clarendon Press, p.&nbsp;62; Heather, Peter, 1991, ''Goths and Romans 332\u2013489'', Oxford, Clarendon Press, p.&nbsp;86; Heather, Peter & Matthews, John, 1991, ''Goths in the Fourth Century'', Liverpool, Liverpool University Press, pp.&nbsp;17\u201326.</ref> In later parts of his text however, Ammianus describes Athanaric as a judge (''iudex'') of the Tervingi, who was attacked by Greuthungi who had joined the [[Huns]].<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' book 31, chapter 4, 13.</ref>\n\n===Gothic War (376\u2013382)===\n{{main|Gothic War (376\u2013382)}}\nThe Thervingi remained in western [[Scythia]] (probably modern Moldavia and Wallachia){{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} until 376, when one of their leaders, Fritigern, appealed to the Roman emperor Valens to be allowed to settle with his people on the south bank of the Danube. The vision that there, they hoped to find refuge from the Huns, is today contested by historians. It is more likely that they settled because of peace negotiations following the first Gothic War.<ref>Pieter Hoppenbrouwers and Wim Blockmans, ''Introduction to Medieval Europe'' 8th version, (Amsterdam: Bert Bakker, 2016): 43.</ref> Valens permitted this. However, a famine broke out and Rome was unwilling to supply them with the food they were promised nor the land; open revolt ensued leading to 6 years of plundering and destruction throughout the Balkans, the death of a Roman Emperor and the destruction of an entire Roman army.\nThe [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378 was the decisive moment of the war. The Roman forces were slaughtered; the Emperor Valens was killed during the fighting, shocking the Roman world and eventually forcing the Romans to negotiate with and settle the Barbarians on Roman land, a new trend with far reaching consequences for the eventual fall of the Roman Empire.\n\n==Archaeology==\n{{main|Chernyakhov culture}}\nIn time and geographical area, the Thervingi and their neighbors the Greuthungi correspond to the archaeological S\u00eentana de Mure\u015f-Chernyakhov Culture.\n\n===Settlement pattern===\nChernyakhov settlements cluster in open ground in river valleys. The houses include sunken-floored dwellings, surface dwellings, and stall-houses. The largest known settlement (Budesty) is 35 hectares.<ref>Heather, Peter & Matthews, John, 1991, ''The Goths in the Fourth Century'', Liverpool, Liverpool University Press, pp. 52\u201354.</ref> Most settlements are open and unfortified; some forts are also known. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n===Burial practices===\nS\u00eentana de Mure\u015f cemeteries are better known than S\u00eentana de Mure\u015f settlements.<ref>Heather, Peter & Matthews, John, 1991, ''Goths in the Fourth Century,'' Liverpool, Liverpool University Press, p. 54.</ref>\n\nS\u00eentana de Mure\u015f cemeteries show the same basic characteristics as other Chernyakhov cemeteries. These include both [[cremation]] and [[inhumation]] burials; among the latter the head is to the north. Some graves were left empty. Grave goods often include pottery, bone combs, and iron tools, but almost never any weapons.<ref>Heather, Peter & Matthews, John, 1991, ''Goths in the Fourth Century,'' Liverpool, Liverpool University Press, pp. 54\u201356.</ref>\n\n==Religion==\n{{main|Germanic paganism|Gothic Christianity}}\n\nThe original religion of the Thervingi is Wodinism, though [[Sabbas the Goth|Saba or Sava]]'s martyrology and [[Wulfila]]'s Bible translation may provide clues. Some months and days were holy, and cult observance and [[Bl\u00f3t|ceremonies]] were compulsory with their piety. Roman prisoners brought [[Christianity]] to the Thervingi. This spread fast enough that several Therving kings and their supporters persecuted the Christian Thervingi, as attested by the story of [[Wereka and Batwin]], and many of whom fled to [[Moesia]] in the Roman Empire. [[Ulfilas|Wulfila]] translated the [[Bible]] into Gothic during this exile.<ref>[[Philostorgius]], ''Church History'', book 2, chapter 5.</ref>\n\nSettled in Dacia, the Thervingi [[Christianization|adopted]] [[Arianism]], at the time in power in the Eastern Empire, a branch of [[Christianity]] that believed that [[Jesus]] was not an aspect of [[God]] in the [[Holy Trinity|Trinity]], but a demigod. This belief was in opposition to the tenets of [[Catholicism]], which achieved a religious monopoly in the late 4th and 5th century.\n\n==Language==\n{{main|Gothic language|Gothic alphabet}}\nAs a branch of the [[Goths]], the Thervinigi spoke Thervinigi [[dialect]] of [[Gothic language|Gothic]], an extinct [[East Germanic languages|East Germanic language]].\n\n==Relationship with the Visigoths==\n[[Image:Gutthiuda.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Gutthiuda, the country of Visigoths (Thervingi)]]\n\nBased upon the medieval writer [[Jordanes]] who described identified the Visigothic kings from [[Alaric I]] to [[Alaric II]] as the heirs of the 4th-century Thervingian \"judge\" (''iudex'') [[Athanaric]], Visigoths have traditionally been treated as successors of the Thervingi.<ref>Heather, pp. 52\u201357, 300\u2013301.</ref>\n \nIn defense of this equation, Herwig Wolfram, interprets the ''Notitia Dignitatum'' to equate the [[Vesi]] with the Thervingi in the period 388\u2013391;<ref name=\"Wolfram24\"/> According to [[Herwig Wolfram]], the primary sources either use the terminology of Thervingi/Greuthungi or Vesi/Ostrogothi and never mix the pairs.<ref name=\"Wolfram24\"/>\n\nOn the other hand, another other recent interpretation of the ''Notitia'' is that the two names, Vesi and Tervingi, are found in different places in the list, \"a clear indication that we are dealing with two different army units, which must also presumably mean that they are, after all, perceived as two different peoples\".<ref>{{cite book|first=Arne S\u00f8by |last=Christensen |title=Cassiodorus, Jordanes and the History of the Goths: Studies in a Migration Myth |year=2002|url=https://books.google.be/books?id=AcLDHOqOt4cC |page=219}}</ref> Peter Heather has written that Wolfram's position is \"entirely arguable, but so is the opposite\".<ref>{{citation|editor-last=Heather|editor1-first=Heather |title=The Visigoths from the Migration Period to the Seventh Century: An Ethnographic Perspective|year=1999 |url=https://books.google.be/books?id=0QLwfButJokC |p=75}}</ref>\n\nWolfram believes that the terms Thervingi and Greuthungi were older geographical identifiers used by each tribe to describe the other.<ref name=\"Wolfram25\"/> The terminology therefore dropped out of use after the Goths were displaced by the [[Hunnic invasions]].In contrast he proposes that the terms \"Vesi\" and \"Ostrogothi\" were used by the peoples to boastfully describe themselves.<ref name=\"Wolfram25\"/> Thus, the Thervingi would have called themselves Vesi.\n\n==Leaders==\n\n===Pagan kings===\n*[[Athanaric]] (369\u2013381)\n*[[Rothesteus]] (underking)<ref>''Passion of St. Saba''</ref>\n\n===Rebel leaders===\n*[[Fritigern]] (c. 376\u2013c. 380)\n\n\n{{Portal|Ancient Germanic culture}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Germanic peoples}}\n\n[[Category:Early Germanic peoples]]\n[[Category:Goths]]\n[[Category:Visigoths]]\n", "text_old": "{{distinguish|Thuringii}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:Chernyakhov.PNG|right|250px|thumb|\n{{legend|#0f0|[[G\u00f6taland]]}}\n{{legend|#f08|[[Gotland]]}}\n{{legend|#f00|[[Wielbark culture]] in the early 3rd century}}\n{{legend|#f80|[[Chernyakhov culture]] in the early 4th century}}\n{{legend|#80f|[[Roman Empire]]}}]]\nThe '''Thervingi''', '''Tervingi''', or '''Teruingi''' (sometimes pluralised '''Tervings''' or '''Thervings''') were a [[Goths|Gothic]] people of the plains north of the [[Lower Danube]] and west of the [[Dniester]] River in the 3rd and the 4th centuries.

Symbols of power and prestige of Germanic elite in Late Antiquity.]</ref>\n\nIn 367, the Roman Emperor [[Valens]] attacked the Thervingi north of the Danube river in retribution for their having supported the [[Procopius (usurper)|usurper Procopius]], who had died in 366. However, he was unable to hit them directly, because apparently the bulk of the Goths retreated to the ''Montes Serrorum'' (which is probably the south Carpathians). [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] says that Valens could not find anyone to fight with (''nullum inveniret quem superare poterat vel terrere'') and even implies that all of them fled, horror-struck, to the mountains (''omnes formidine perciti... montes petivere Serrorum''). In the following year, the flooding of the Danube prevented the Romans from crossing the river. \n\nIn 369, Valens finally penetrated deep into the Gothic territory, winning a series of skirmishes with Greuthungi, who are mentioned here for the first time in a classical record. [[Athanaric]] who was, in this passage, described by Ammianus as their most powerful judge \"''iudicem potentissimum''\" (implying he was a leader of the Greuthingi) was compelled to flee, and then make a peace agreement in the middle of the Danube, promising to never set foot on Roman soil.<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' book 27, chapter 5, 5-9; Further reading for this episode: Heather, Peter, 1996, ''The Goths'', Oxford, Clarendon Press, p.&nbsp;62; Heather, Peter, 1991, ''Goths and Romans 332\u2013489'', Oxford, Clarendon Press, p.&nbsp;86; Heather, Peter & Matthews, John, 1991, ''Goths in the Fourth Century'', Liverpool, Liverpool University Press, pp.&nbsp;17\u201326.</ref> In later parts of his text however, Ammianus describes Athanaric as a judge (''iudex'') of the Tervingi, who was attacked by Greuthungi who had joined the [[Huns]].<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' book 31, chapter 4, 13.</ref>\n\n===Gothic War (376\u2013382)===\n{{main|Gothic War (376\u2013382)}}\nThe Thervingi remained in western [[Scythia]] (probably modern Moldavia and Wallachia){{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} until 376, when one of their leaders, Fritigern, appealed to the Roman emperor Valens to be allowed to settle with his people on the south bank of the Danube. The vision that there, they hoped to find refuge from the Huns, is today contested by historians. It is more likely that they settled because of peace negotiations following the first Gothic War.<ref>Pieter Hoppenbrouwers and Wim Blockmans, ''Introduction to Medieval Europe'' 8th version, (Amsterdam: Bert Bakker, 2016): 43.</ref> Valens permitted this. However, a famine broke out and Rome was unwilling to supply them with the food they were promised nor the land; open revolt ensued leading to 6 years of plundering and destruction throughout the Balkans, the death of a Roman Emperor and the destruction of an entire Roman army.\nThe [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378 was the decisive moment of the war. The Roman forces were slaughtered; the Emperor Valens was killed during the fighting, shocking the Roman world and eventually forcing the Romans to negotiate with and settle the Barbarians on Roman land, a new trend with far reaching consequences for the eventual fall of the Roman Empire.\n\n==Archaeology==\n{{main|Chernyakhov culture}}\nIn time and geographical area, the Thervingi and their neighbors the Greuthungi correspond to the archaeological S\u00eentana de Mure\u015f-Chernyakhov Culture.\n\n===Settlement pattern===\nChernyakhov settlements cluster in open ground in river valleys. The houses include sunken-floored dwellings, surface dwellings, and stall-houses. The largest known settlement (Budesty) is 35 hectares.<ref>Heather, Peter & Matthews, John, 1991, ''The Goths in the Fourth Century'', Liverpool, Liverpool University Press, pp. 52\u201354.</ref> Most settlements are open and unfortified; some forts are also known. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n===Burial practices===\nS\u00eentana de Mure\u015f cemeteries are better known than S\u00eentana de Mure\u015f settlements.<ref>Heather, Peter & Matthews, John, 1991, ''Goths in the Fourth Century,'' Liverpool, Liverpool University Press, p. 54.</ref>\n\nS\u00eentana de Mure\u015f cemeteries show the same basic characteristics as other Chernyakhov cemeteries. These include both [[cremation]] and [[inhumation]] burials; among the latter the head is to the north. Some graves were left empty. Grave goods often include pottery, bone combs, and iron tools, but almost never any weapons.<ref>Heather, Peter & Matthews, John, 1991, ''Goths in the Fourth Century,'' Liverpool, Liverpool University Press, pp. 54\u201356.</ref>\n\n==Religion==\n{{main|Germanic paganism|Gothic Christianity}}\n\nThe original religion of the Thervingi is Wodinism, though [[Sabbas the Goth|Saba or Sava]]'s martyrology and [[Wulfila]]'s Bible translation may provide clues. Some months and days were holy, and cult observance and [[Bl\u00f3t|ceremonies]] were compulsory with their piety. Roman prisoners brought [[Christianity]] to the Thervingi. This spread fast enough that several Therving kings and their supporters persecuted the Christian Thervingi, as attested by the story of [[Wereka and Batwin]], and many of whom fled to [[Moesia]] in the Roman Empire. [[Ulfilas|Wulfila]] translated the [[Bible]] into Gothic during this exile.<ref>[[Philostorgius]], ''Church History'', book 2, chapter 5.</ref>\n\nSettled in Dacia, the Thervingi [[Christianization|adopted]] [[Arianism]], at the time in power in the Eastern Empire, a branch of [[Christianity]] that believed that [[Jesus]] was not an aspect of [[God]] in the [[Holy Trinity|Trinity]], but a demigod. This belief was in opposition to the tenets of [[Catholicism]], which achieved a religious monopoly in the late 4th and 5th century.\n\n==Language==\n{{main|Gothic language|Gothic alphabet}}\nAs a branch of the [[Goths]], the Thervinigi spoke Thervinigi [[dialect]] of [[Gothic language|Gothic]], an extinct [[East Germanic languages|East Germanic language]].\n\n==Relationship with the Visigoths==\n[[Image:Gutthiuda.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Gutthiuda, the country of Visigoths (Thervingi)]]\n\nBased upon the medieval writer [[Jordanes]] who described identified the Visigothic kings from [[Alaric I]] to [[Alaric II]] as the heirs of the 4th-century Thervingian \"judge\" (''iudex'') [[Athanaric]], Visigoths have traditionally been treated as successors of the Thervingi.<ref>Heather, pp. 52\u201357, 300\u2013301.</ref>\n \nIn defense of this equation, Herwig Wolfram, interprets the ''Notitia Dignitatum'' to equate the [[Vesi]] with the Thervingi in the period 388\u2013391;<ref name=\"Wolfram24\"/> According to [[Herwig Wolfram]], the primary sources either use the terminology of Thervingi/Greuthungi or Vesi/Ostrogothi and never mix the pairs.<ref name=\"Wolfram24\"/>\n\nOn the other hand, another other recent interpretation of the ''Notitia'' is that the two names, Vesi and Tervingi, are found in different places in the list, \"a clear indication that we are dealing with two different army units, which must also presumably mean that they are, after all, perceived as two different peoples\".<ref>{{cite book|first=Arne S\u00f8by |last=Christensen |title=Cassiodorus, Jordanes and the History of the Goths: Studies in a Migration Myth |year=2002|url=https://books.google.be/books?id=AcLDHOqOt4cC |page=219}}</ref> Peter Heather has written that Wolfram's position is \"entirely arguable, but so is the opposite\".<ref>{{citation|editor-last=Heather|editor1-first=Heather |title=The Visigoths from the Migration Period to the Seventh Century: An Ethnographic Perspective|year=1999 |url=https://books.google.be/books?id=0QLwfButJokC |p=75}}</ref>\n\nWolfram believes that the terms Thervingi and Greuthungi were older geographical identifiers used by each tribe to describe the other.<ref name=\"Wolfram25\"/> The terminology therefore dropped out of use after the Goths were displaced by the [[Hunnic invasions]].In contrast he proposes that the terms \"Vesi\" and \"Ostrogothi\" were used by the peoples to boastfully describe themselves.<ref name=\"Wolfram25\"/> Thus, the Thervingi would have called themselves Vesi.\n\n==Leaders==\n\n===Pagan kings===\n*[[Athanaric]] (369\u2013381)\n*[[Rothesteus]] (underking)<ref>''Passion of St. Saba''</ref>\n\n===Rebel leaders===\n*[[Fritigern]] (c. 376\u2013c. 380)\n\n\n{{Portal|Ancient Germanic culture}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Germanic peoples}}\n\n[[Category:Early Germanic peoples]]\n[[Category:Goths]]\n[[Category:Visigoths]]\n", "name_user": "Andrew Lancaster", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eThird century", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thervingi"}

Fronted by singer-songwriter [[Jay Kay]], the band were a prominent component of the London-based funk/jazz movement of the 1990s. Their sound draws from [[List of musical genres of the African diaspora|black music]] of the 1970s, and their lyrics and visual concepts occasionally deal with social and environmental idealism. They also drew from [[Rock music|rock]], [[electronica]] and [[Latin music]], and on stage perform with several musicians in the band playing live. Over the years, Kay has consistently remained as the leader through several line-up changes.\n\nThe band d\u00e9buted with \"[[When You Gonna Learn]]\" under [[Acid Jazz Records|Acid Jazz records]], which led to Kay signing a record deal with [[S2_Records|Sony Soho<sup>2</sup>]]. While under this label, the group released a string of million-selling albums containing singles that have reached various charts worldwide, including the 1998 single \"[[Deeper Underground]]\", which topped in the UK, while having moderate success in the US within the Dance charts. All eight of the band's albums have entered the UK top 10. Three of them, ''[[Emergency on Planet Earth]]'' (1993), ''[[Synkronized]]'' (1999), ''[[A Funk Odyssey]]'' (2001), along with [[High Times: Singles 1992\u20132006|their greatest hits compilation]], charted at number 1.\n\nJamiroquai have sold more than 26 million albums worldwide as of 2017. Their third album ''[[Travelling Without Moving]]'' (1996), received a [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] for the best-selling funk album in history. The music video for the album's lead single, \"[[Virtual Insanity]]\", was named [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]] at the [[1997 MTV Video Music Awards]]. The group has won an [[Ivor Novello Awards|Ivor Novello Award]] for Outstanding Song Collection from the [[British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors]], as well as one [[Grammy Award]], two [[MTV Video Music Award]]s, and two [[Billboard Music Award|''Billboard'' Music Award]]s.

Their third album ''[[Travelling Without Moving]]'' (1996), received a [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] for the best-selling funk album in history.

The company was founded in June 2009 by [[Mike Wilson (executive)|Mike Wilson]], Harry Miller and Rick Stults, alongside business partners Nigel Lowrie and Graeme Struthers. The three founders had previously operated [[Gathering of Developers]] and [[Gamecock Media Group]], which published games on developer-friendly terms, but due to the high cost associated with releasing retail games saw themselves acquired and dissolved by larger companies. To avoid this, Devolver Digital instead turned to [[digital distribution]] channels.\n\nDevolver Digital started by publishing high-definition remakes of games in the ''[[Serious Sam]]'' series of games. After success with these remakes and [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] games based on the series, Devolver Digital began publishing games from other, smaller independent studios, one of the first being their breakout title, ''[[Hotline Miami]]''. The company also operates '''Devolver Digital Films''' for [[film distribution]], and majority-owns publisher [[Good Shepherd Entertainment]]. As of January 2020, Devolver Digital employs 20 people.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Founding and initial development (2009\u20132012) ===\nDevolver Digital was founded in [[Austin, Texas]], by [[Mike Wilson (executive)|Mike Wilson]], Harry Miller and Rick Stults.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2009/06/25/gamecock-gathering-of-developers-founders-re-emerge-as-devolver/ |title=Gamecock, Gathering of Developers founders re-emerge as Devolver Digital |first=Christopher |last=Grant |date=June 25, 2009 |website=[[Engadget]] |access-date=August 26, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729181511/https://www.engadget.com/2009/06/25/gamecock-gathering-of-developers-founders-re-emerge-as-devolver/ |archive-date=July 29, 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/what-to-play/meet-devolver-digital-gamings-own-death-row-records/ |title=Meet Devolver Digital, gaming's own Death Row Records |first=Kirk |last=McKeand |date=August 31, 2016 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |access-date=November 27, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181127193508/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/what-to-play/meet-devolver-digital-gamings-own-death-row-records/ |archive-date=November 27, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"PCGamesN: Five years\">{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/if-first-you-dont-succeed-mike-wilson-five-years-devolver-and-lifetime-publishing-struggles |title=If at first you don't succeed: Mike Wilson on five years of Devolver, and a lifetime of publishing struggles |first=Rob |last=Zacny |date=June 30, 2014 |website=[[PCGamesN]] |access-date=November 27, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181127200548/https://www.pcgamesn.com/if-first-you-dont-succeed-mike-wilson-five-years-devolver-and-lifetime-publishing-struggles |archive-date=November 27, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> The three had previously co-founded publishing companies [[Gathering of Developers]] in 1998, and [[Gamecock Media Group]] in 2007.<ref name=\"PCGamesN: Five years\" /><ref name=\"The Verge: Ten years\">{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/5/18652878/devolver-digital-anniversary-hotline-miami-serious-sam-indie-gaming |title=Why gaming's most influential indie label has stayed small for a decade |first=Andrew |last=Webster |date=June 5, 2019 |website=[[The Verge]] |access-date=June 8, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190608034955/https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/5/18652878/devolver-digital-anniversary-hotline-miami-serious-sam-indie-gaming |archive-date=June 8, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"GIbiz: Gamecock\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/gamecock-co-founders-start-new-publishing-company |title=Gamecock co-founders start new publishing company |first=Kath |last=Brice |date=June 26, 2009 |website=[[GamesIndustry.biz]] |access-date=September 8, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180908164908/https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/gamecock-co-founders-start-new-publishing-company |archive-date=September 8, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> With both Gathering of Developers and Gamecock Media Group, the co-founders had envisioned a publishing model wherein the publisher would handle all logistical aspects of releasing a game, so that the developer could focus on developing the game itself.<ref name=\"The Verge: Ten years\" /> This included offering deals wherein the developers could keep all rights to their games.<ref name=\"The Verge: Ten years\" /> However, at the time of these companies' existences, the primary distribution channel for games was [[retail]], which was very costly.<ref name=\"The Verge: Ten years\" /> As a result, both companies saw themselves acquired by larger companies at some point, and were dissolved shortly thereafter.<ref name=\"The Verge: Ten years\" /> Devolver Digital thus aimed at not producing games in physical forms, and instead focusing publishing efforts for [[digital distribution]] platforms, such as [[Steam (software)|Steam]].<ref name=\"The Verge: Ten years\" />\n\nDevolver Digital started with six people, including the three founders, as well as founding partners Nigel Lowrie and Graeme Struthers, also prior business partners of Wilson.<ref name=\"The Verge: Ten years\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/how-devolver-digital-is-redefining-videogame-publishing/ |title=How Devolver Digital is redefining videogame publishing |first=Steven |last=Messner |date=September 23, 2016 |website=[[PC Gamer]] |access-date=September 8, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180908202308/https://www.pcgamer.com/how-devolver-digital-is-redefining-videogame-publishing/ |archive-date=September 8, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> The company's establishment was announced on June 25, 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://kotaku.com/gamecock-resurrected-as-devolver-digital-5302626 |title=Gamecock Resurrected As Devolver Digital?

The company was founded in June 2009 by [[Mike Wilson (executive)|Mike Wilson]], Harry Miller and Rick Stults, alongside business partners Nigel Lowrie and Graeme Struthers. The three founders had previously operated [[Gathering of Developers]] and [[Gamecock Media Group]], which published games on developer-friendly terms, but due to the high cost associated with releasing retail games saw themselves acquired and dissolved by larger companies. To avoid this, Devolver Digital instead turned to [[digital distribution]] channels.\n\nDevolver Digital started by publishing high-definition remakes of games in the ''[[Serious Sam]]'' series of games. After success with these remakes and [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] games based on the series, Devolver Digital began publishing games from other, smaller independent studios, one of the first being their breakout title, ''[[Hotline Miami]]''. The company also operates '''Devolver Digital Films''' for [[film distribution]], and majority-owns publisher [[Good Shepherd Entertainment]]. As of January 2020, Devolver Digital employs 20 people.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Founding and initial development (2009\u20132012) ===\nDevolver Digital was founded in [[Austin, Texas]], by [[Mike Wilson (executive)|Mike Wilson]], Harry Miller and Rick Stults.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2009/06/25/gamecock-gathering-of-developers-founders-re-emerge-as-devolver/ |title=Gamecock, Gathering of Developers founders re-emerge as Devolver Digital |first=Christopher |last=Grant |date=June 25, 2009 |website=[[Engadget]] |access-date=August 26, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729181511/https://www.engadget.com/2009/06/25/gamecock-gathering-of-developers-founders-re-emerge-as-devolver/ |archive-date=July 29, 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/what-to-play/meet-devolver-digital-gamings-own-death-row-records/ |title=Meet Devolver Digital, gaming's own Death Row Records |first=Kirk |last=McKeand |date=August 31, 2016 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |access-date=November 27, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181127193508/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/what-to-play/meet-devolver-digital-gamings-own-death-row-records/ |archive-date=November 27, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"PCGamesN: Five years\">{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/if-first-you-dont-succeed-mike-wilson-five-years-devolver-and-lifetime-publishing-struggles |title=If at first you don't succeed: Mike Wilson on five years of Devolver, and a lifetime of publishing struggles |first=Rob |last=Zacny |date=June 30, 2014 |website=[[PCGamesN]] |access-date=November 27, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181127200548/https://www.pcgamesn.com/if-first-you-dont-succeed-mike-wilson-five-years-devolver-and-lifetime-publishing-struggles |archive-date=November 27, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> The three had previously co-founded publishing companies [[Gathering of Developers]] in 1998, and [[Gamecock Media Group]] in 2007.<ref name=\"PCGamesN: Five years\" /><ref name=\"The Verge: Ten years\">{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/5/18652878/devolver-digital-anniversary-hotline-miami-serious-sam-indie-gaming |title=Why gaming's most influential indie label has stayed small for a decade |first=Andrew |last=Webster |date=June 5, 2019 |website=[[The Verge]] |access-date=June 8, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190608034955/https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/5/18652878/devolver-digital-anniversary-hotline-miami-serious-sam-indie-gaming |archive-date=June 8, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"GIbiz: Gamecock\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/gamecock-co-founders-start-new-publishing-company |title=Gamecock co-founders start new publishing company |first=Kath |last=Brice |date=June 26, 2009 |website=[[GamesIndustry.biz]] |access-date=September 8, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180908164908/https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/gamecock-co-founders-start-new-publishing-company |archive-date=September 8, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> With both Gathering of Developers and Gamecock Media Group, the co-founders had envisioned a publishing model wherein the publisher would handle all logistical aspects of releasing a game, so that the developer could focus on developing the game itself.<ref name=\"The Verge: Ten years\" /> This included offering deals wherein the developers could keep all rights to their games.<ref name=\"The Verge: Ten years\" /> However, at the time of these companies' existences, the primary distribution channel for games was [[retail]], which was very costly.<ref name=\"The Verge: Ten years\" /> As a result, both companies saw themselves acquired by larger companies at some point, and were dissolved shortly thereafter.<ref name=\"The Verge: Ten years\" /> Devolver Digital thus aimed at not producing games in physical forms, and instead focusing publishing efforts for [[digital distribution]] platforms, such as [[Steam (software)|Steam]].<ref name=\"The Verge: Ten years\" />\n\nDevolver Digital started with six people, including the three founders, as well as founding partners Nigel Lowrie and Graeme Struthers, also prior business partners of Wilson.<ref name=\"The Verge: Ten years\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/how-devolver-digital-is-redefining-videogame-publishing/ |title=How Devolver Digital is redefining videogame publishing |first=Steven |last=Messner |date=September 23, 2016 |website=[[PC Gamer]] |access-date=September 8, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180908202308/https://www.pcgamer.com/how-devolver-digital-is-redefining-videogame-publishing/ |archive-date=September 8, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> The company's establishment was announced on June 25, 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://kotaku.com/gamecock-resurrected-as-devolver-digital-5302626 |title=Gamecock Resurrected As Devolver Digital?

He was the first known physician to describe completely, and in detail, the [[systemic circulation]] and properties of blood being pumped to the brain and the rest of the body by the [[heart]], though earlier writers, such as [[Realdo Colombo]], [[Michael Servetus]], and [[Jacques Dubois]], had provided precursors of the theory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cryptojews.com/Amatus%20Lusitanus.htm|title=There's a reasonable basis to assume that it was Dr. Amatus who first discovered the \"Blood circulation\" phenomena|accessdate=8 December 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403121512/http://www.cryptojews.com/Amatus%20Lusitanus.htm|archivedate=3 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.questia.com/read/9426369/aubrey-s-brief-lives | title=Malter Warner | work=Aubrey's Brief Lives | publisher=Michigan U.

Records and personal descriptions delineate him as an overall calm, diligent, and intelligent man whose \"sons... revered, consulted and implicitly trusted in him... (they) made their father the treasurer of their wealth when they acquired great estates...(He) kept, employed, and improved their gainings to their great advantage.\"{{sfn|Power|p=4}} Thomas Harvey's portrait can still be seen in the central panel of a wall of the dining-room at Rolls Park, [[Chigwell]], in [[Essex]]. William was the eldest of nine children, seven sons and two daughters, of Thomas and his wife Joan Halke. \n\nNotable family connections include [[Heneage Finch, 1st Earl of Nottingham]], who married William's niece Elizabeth Harvey, and the diplomat Sir [[Daniel Harvey (diplomat)|Daniel Harvey]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} His great nephew was the naval hero [[Eliab Harvey]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.218</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life and the University of Padua===\nHarvey's initial education was carried out in Folkestone, where he learned [[Latin]]. He then entered the [[King's School, Canterbury|King's School]] ([[Canterbury]]). Harvey stayed at the King's School for five years, after which he [[matriculated]] at [[Gonville and Caius College]] in [[Cambridge]] in 1593.\n\nHarvey graduated as a Bachelor of Arts from Caius in 1597.<ref>{{acad|id=HRVY593W|name=Harvie, William}}</ref> He then travelled through France and Germany to Italy, where he entered the [[University of Padua]], in 1599.\n\nDuring Harvey's years of study there, he developed a relationship with [[Hieronymus Fabricius|Fabricius]] and read Fabricius's ''De Venarum Ostiolis''.\n\nHarvey graduated as a Doctor of Medicine at the age of 24 from the University of Padua on 25 April 1602. Harvey had\n\n<blockquote>\"conducted himself so wonderfully well in the examination and had shown such skill, memory and learning that he had far surpassed even the great hopes which his examiners had formed of him.\"{{sfn|Power|pp=26\u201327}}</blockquote>\n\n===The College of Physicians, marriage and Saint Bartholomew's Hospital===\nAfter graduating from Padua, Harvey immediately returned to England where he obtained the degree of Doctor of Medicine from the [[University of Cambridge]] that same year, and became a fellow of [[Gonville and Caius College]]. Following this, Harvey established himself in London, joining the [[Royal College of Physicians]] on 5 October 1604.\n\nA few weeks after his admission, Harvey married Elizabeth Browne, \"daughter of [[Lancelot Browne]] Dr. Physic\" (a medical doctor).{{sfn|Power|p=29}} They had no children.\n\nHarvey was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians on 5 June 1607, which earned him the [[Post-nominal letters]] FRCP. He then accepted a position at [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]] that he was to occupy for almost all the rest of his life. Succeeding Dr Wilkinson on 14 October 1609, he became the Physician in charge at [[St Bartholomew's Hospital|St&nbsp;Bartholomew's Hospital]], which enjoined him, \"in God's most holy name\" to \"endeavor yourself to do the best of your knowledge in the profession of physic to the poor then present, or any other of the poor at any time of the week which shall be sent home unto you by the Hospitaller... You shall not, for favor, lucre or gain, appoint or write anything for the poor but such good and wholesome things as you shall think with your best advice will do the poor good, without any affection or respect to be had to the apothecary. And you shall take no gift or reward... for your counsel... This you will promise to do as you shall answer before God... \"{{sfn|Power|pp=35\u201336}}\n\nHarvey earned around thirty-three pounds a year and lived in a small house in [[Ludgate]], although two houses in [[West Smithfield]] were attached as fringe benefits to the post of Physician. At this point, the physician's function consisted of a simple but thorough analysis of patients who were brought to the hospital once a week and the subsequent writing of prescriptions.{{fact|date=January 2019}}\n\n===Lumleian Lecturer===\nThe next important phase of Harvey's life began with his appointment to the office of [[Lumleian lectures|Lumleian lecturer]] on 4 August 1615.<ref>{{cite journal |title=De Motu Cordis: the Lumleian Lecture of 1616: an imagined playlet concerning the discovery of the circulation of the blood by William Harvey. |journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine |volume=100 |issue=4 |pages=199\u2013204 |pmid=17404345 |pmc=1847732 |year=2007 |last1=Silverman |first1=M.

He seems to have similarly served various [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]], including [[Francis Bacon|Lord Chancellor Bacon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-Harvey|title=William Harvey, English physician|last=Gregory|first=Andrew|work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref>{{sfn|Power|p=71}} Bacon entirely failed to impress the more practical minded Harvey, who refused to regard him as a great philosopher. He said of him \"He writes philosophy like a Lord Chancellor.\"{{sfn|Power|p=72}}\n\nIn 1628 he published in [[Frankfurt]] his completed treatise on the circulation of the blood, the ''[[De Motu Cordis]]''. As a result of negative comments by other physicians Harvey \"fell mightily in his practice\",{{sfn|Power|p=74}} but continued advancing his career. He was re-elected 'Censor' of the College of Physicians in 1629, having been elected for the first time in 1613 and the second time in 1625. Eventually, Harvey was also elected Treasurer of the College.{{fact|date=January 2019}}\n\n===Witchcraft trials===\nHarvey was a prominent sceptic regarding allegations of witchcraft. He was one of the examiners of four women from Lancashire accused of witchcraft in 1634, and as a consequence of his report, all of them were acquitted.<ref>{{cite book|title=Life of Harvey|last=Power|first=d'Arcey|publisher=Longmans, Green, & co.|ref=harv}}</ref><ref>''BMJ'' 18 September 1926</ref> Earlier, in 1632, while travelling with the King to [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]], he had been sent to investigate a woman accused of being a witch. Initially he told her that he was a wizard and had come to discuss the Craft with her, and asked whether she had a familiar. She put down a saucer of milk and called to a toad which came out and drank the milk. He then sent her out to fetch some ale, and killed the toad and dissected it, concluding that it was a perfectly ordinary animal and not supernatural in any way. When the woman returned she was naturally very angry and upset, but Harvey eventually silenced her by stating that he was the King's Physician, sent to discover whether she were a witch, and if she were, to have her apprehended.<ref>''Selected Writings of Joseph Needham'' ed Mansell Davies</ref>\n\n===Excursions abroad, election as physician to Charles I and the English Civil War===\nAt the age of fifty-two, Harvey received commands by the king to accompany the [[Duke of Lennox]] during his trip abroad. This voyage \u2013 the first after Harvey's return from [[Padua]] \u2013 lasted three years, taking Harvey through the countries of France and Spain during the [[Mantuan War]] and [[Plague (disease)|Plague]]. During this journey he wrote to [[Viscount Dorchester]]:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"I can complain that by the way we could scarce see a dog, crow, kite, raven or any other bird, or anything to anatomize, only some few miserable people, the relics of the war and the plague where famine had made anatomies before I came. It is scarce credible in so rich, populous, and plentiful countries as these were that so much misery and desolation, poverty and famine should in so short a time be, as we have seen. I interpret it well that it will be a great motive for all here to have and procure assurance of settled [[peace]]. It is time to leave fighting when there is nothing to eat, nothing to be kept, and nothing to be gotten\".{{sfn|Power|pp=85\u201386}}\n</blockquote>\n\nHaving returned to England in 1632. Harvey accompanied King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] wherever he went as 'Physician in Ordinary'.  In particular, Charles's hunting expeditions gave Harvey access to many deer carcasses; it was upon them that Harvey made many observations and developed his theories. Harvey returned to Italy in October 1636, dining at the English College, Rome, as a guest of the Jesuits there. It is possible he met Galileo in Florence en route.<ref>[[Edward Chaney]], ''The Grand Tour and the Great Rebellion: Richard Lassels and 'The Voyage of Italy' in the Seventeenth Century'' (Geneva-Turin, 1985), pp. 291\u201393.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[English Civil War]] a mob of citizen-soldiers opposed to the King entered Harvey's lodgings, stole his goods, and scattered his papers. The papers consisted of \"the records of a large number of dissections ... of diseased bodies, with his observations on the development on insects, and a series of notes on comparative anatomy.\"{{sfn|Power|p=125}} During this period, Harvey maintained his position, helped the wounded on several occasions and protected the King's children during the [[Battle of Edgehill]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Stewart|first=D.|date=1946|title=Harvey and the Battle of Edgehill|journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal|volume=55|issue=4|pages=405|pmid=20323936|pmc=1583020}}</ref>\n\nThe conflicts of the Civil War soon led King Charles to [[Oxford]], with Harvey attending, where the physician was made \"Doctor of Physic\" in 1642 and later [[Warden (college)|Warden]] of [[Merton College]] in 1645. \"In [[Oxford]] he (Harvey) very soon settled down to his accustomed pursuits, unmindful of the clatter of arms and of the constant marching and countermarching around him, for the city remained the base of operations until its surrender... \"{{sfn|Power|p=130}}\n\n===Harvey's later years, death and burial===\nThe surrender of Oxford in 1645 marks the beginning of Harvey's gradual retirement from public life and duties. Now sixty-eight years old and childless, Harvey had lost three brothers and his wife by this time. He thus decided to return to London, and lived with his brothers Eliab and Daniel at different periods. Having retired from [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]] and his various other aforementioned positions, he passed most of this time reading general literature. Several attempts to bring Harvey back into the 'working world' were made, however; here is an excerpt of one of Harvey's answers:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"Would you be the man who should recommend me to quit the peaceful haven where I now pass my life and launch again upon the faithless sea? You know full well what a storm my former lucubrations raised. Much better is it oftentimes to grow wise at home and in private, than by publishing what you have amassed with infinite labour, to stir up tempests that may rob you of peace and quiet for the rest of your days.\"{{sfn|Power|pp=150\u2013151}}\n</blockquote>\n\nHarvey died at [[Roehampton]] in the house of his brother Eliab on 3 June 1657. Descriptions of the event seem to show that he died of a [[cerebral haemorrhage]] from vessels long injured by [[gout]]: it is highly probable that the left [[middle cerebral artery]] malfunctioned, leading to a gradual accumulation of blood in the brain which eventually overwhelmed it. There exists a fairly detailed account of what happened on that day.  Harvey\n\n<blockquote>\n\"went to speak and found that he had the dead palsy in his tongue; then he saw what was to become of him. He knew there were then no hopes of his recovery, so presently he sends for his young nephews to come up to him. He then made signs (for seized with the dead palsy in his tongue he could not speak) to let him blood his tongue, which did him little or no good, and so ended his days, dying in the evening of the day on which he was stricken, the palsy giving him an easy passport.\"{{sfn|Power|pp=166\u2013167}}\n</blockquote>\n\nHis [[will (law)|will]] distributed his material goods and wealth throughout his extended family and also left a substantial amount of money to the [[Royal College of Physicians]].\n\nHarvey was buried in [[Hempstead, Essex|Hempstead]], Essex. The funeral procession started on 26 June 1657, leading Harvey to be placed in the 'Harvey Chapel' built by Eliab. The conditions of Harvey's burial are also known: \"Harvey was laid in the chapel between the bodies of his two nieces, and like them he was lapt in lead, coffin less\".{{sfn|Power|p=169}} On [[St. Luke's Day]], 18 October 1883, Harvey's remains were reinterred, the leaden case carried from the vault by eight Fellows of the [[College of Physicians]], and deposited in a sarcophagus containing his works and an inscription:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"The body of William Harvey lapt in lead, simply soldered, was laid without shell or enclosure of any kind in the Harvey vault of this Church of [[Hempstead, Essex|Hempstead]], Essex, in June 1657. In the course of time the lead enclosing the remains was, from expose and natural decay, so seriously damaged as to endanger its preservation, rendering some repair of it the duty of those interested in the memory of the illustrious discoverer of the circulation of the Blood. The [[Royal College of Physicians]], of which corporate body Harvey was a munificent Benefactor did in the years 1882\u20131883, by permission of the Representatives of the Harvey family, undertake this duty. In accordance with this determination the leaden mortuary chest containing the remains of Harvey was repaired, and was, as far as possible, restored to its original state... \"{{sfn|Power|pp=174\u2013175}}\n</blockquote>\n\n==''De Motu Cordis'' (''Anatomical Account of the Motion of the Heart and Blood'')==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=March 2018}}<!--also, most of this content probably should go into the book article-->\n{{main|Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus}}\n[[Image:William Harvey ( 1578-1657) Venenbild.jpg|right|thumb|An experiment from Harvey's ''de Motu Cordis'']]\n\nPublished in 1628 in the city of [[Frankfurt]] (host to an [[Frankfurt Book Fair|annual book fair]] that Harvey knew would allow immediate dispersion of his work), the 72-page ''[[Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus]]'' contains the mature account of the [[pulmonary circulation|circulation of the blood]]. Opening with a dedication to King Charles I, the [[quarto]] has 17 chapters which give a clear and connected account of the action of the heart and the consequent movement of the blood around the body in a circuit. Having only a tiny lens at his disposal, Harvey was not able to reach the adequate pictures that were attained through such microscopes used by [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]]; thus he had to resort to theory {{en dash}} and not practical evidence {{en dash}} in certain parts of his book. After the first chapter, which simply outlines past ideas and accepted rules regarding the heart and lungs, Harvey moves on to a fundamental premise to his treatise, stating that it was important to study the heart when it was active in order to truly comprehend its true movement; a task which even he found of great difficulty, as he says:\n\n<blockquote>\n \"...I found the task so truly arduous... that I was almost tempted to think... that the movement of the heart was only to be comprehended by God. For I could neither rightly perceive at first when the [[Systole (medicine)|systole]] and when the [[diastole]] took place by reason of the rapidity of the movement...\"{{sfn|Power|p=193}}\n</blockquote>\n\nThis initial thought led Harvey's ambition and assiduousness to a detailed analysis of the overall structure of the heart (studied with less hindrances in cold-blooded animals). After this, Harvey goes analyses the [[artery|arteries]], showing how their pulsation depends upon the contraction of the [[left ventricle]], while the contraction of the [[right ventricle]] propels its charge of blood into the [[pulmonary artery]]. Whilst doing this, the physician reiterates the fact that these two [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricles]] move together almost simultaneously and not independently as had been thought previously by his predecessors. This discovery was made while observing the heart of such animals as the [[eel]] and several other types of fish; indeed, the general study of countless animals was of utmost importance to the physician: among the ones already cited, one can add the study of the [[snail]], the [[invisible shrimp]], the [[chicken|chick]] before its hatching and even the pigeon. A digression to an experiment can be made to this note: using the inactive heart of a dead [[pigeon]] and placing upon it a finger wet with [[saliva]], Harvey was able to witness a transitory and yet incontrovertible pulsation. He had just witnessed the heart's ability to recover from [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Niebaeur |first1=Ashley |title=Chapter 7, Heart failure |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK2218/ |website=NCBI|publisher=Remedica |year=2004 }}</ref>\nAs early as the 17th century, William Harvey had already discerned the existence of the [[Ductus arteriosus]] and explained its relative function. Here he says, \"...in [[embryo]]s, whilst the lungs are in a state of inaction, performing no function, subject to no movement any more than if they had not been present, Nature uses the two ventricles of the heart as if they formed but one for the transmission of the blood.\"{{sfn|Power|pp=202\u2013203}} However, the apex of Harvey's work is probably the eighth chapter, in which he deals with the actual quantity of blood passing through the heart from the [[vein]]s to the arteries. Coming into conflict with [[Galen]]'s accepted view of the [[liver]] as the origin of venous blood, Harvey estimated the capacity of the heart, how much blood is expelled through each [[Muscle contraction|pump]] of the heart, and the number of times the heart beats in a half an hour. All of these estimates were purposefully low, so that people could see the vast amount of blood Galen's theory required the liver to produce. He estimated that the capacity of the heart was {{convert|1.5|impfloz|ml|lk=on}}, and that every time the heart pumps, {{frac|8}} of that blood is expelled. This led to Harvey's estimate that about {{convert|1/6|impfloz|ml}} of blood went through the heart every time it pumped. The next estimate he used was that the heart beats 1,000 times every half an hour, which gave 10 pounds 6 ounces of blood in a half an hour, and when this number was multiplied by 48 half hours in a day he realised that the liver would have to produce 498 pounds of blood in a day, more than the weight of the whole body.\n\nHaving this simple but essential mathematical proportion at hand \u2013 which proved the overall impossible aforementioned role of the liver \u2013 Harvey went on to prove how the blood circulated in a circle by means of countless experiments initially done on [[snake|serpents]] and fish: tying their veins and arteries in separate periods of time, Harvey noticed the modifications which occurred; indeed, as he tied the veins, the heart would become empty, while as he did the same to the arteries, the organ would swell up. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Billimoria |first1=Aspi |title=Pioneers in Cardiology: William Harvey |url=http://www.japi.org/june_2012/16_pic_william_harvey.html |website=JAPI}}</ref>\n\nThis process was later performed on the human body (in the image on the right): the physician tied a tight ligature onto the upper arm of a person. This would cut off blood flow from the arteries and the veins. When this was done, the arm below the [[ligature (medicine)|ligature]] was cool and pale, while above the ligature it was warm and swollen. The ligature was loosened slightly, which allowed blood from the arteries to come into the arm, since arteries are deeper in the flesh than the veins. When this was done, the opposite effect was seen in the lower arm. It was now warm and swollen. The veins were also more visible, since now they were full of blood. Harvey then noticed little bumps in the veins, which he realised were the [[Vein valve|valves of the veins]] discovered by his teacher, [[Hieronymus Fabricius]]. Harvey tried to push blood in the vein down the arm, but to no avail. When he tried to push it up the arm, it moved quite easily. The same effect was seen in other veins of the body, except the veins in the neck. Those veins were different from the others \u2013 they did not allow blood to flow up, but only down. This led Harvey to believe that the veins allowed blood to flow to the heart, and the valves maintained the one way flow.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Friedland |first1=Gerald |title=Discovery of the function of the heart and circulation of blood |pmc=3721262 }}</ref>\n\nContrary to a popular misconception, Harvey did not predict the existence of [[capillary|capillaries]]. His observations convinced him that direct connection between veins and arteries are unnecessary; he wrote \"blood permeates the pores\" in the flesh and it is \"absorbed and imbibed from every part\" by the veins.<ref>As cited in: Douglas Allchin, \"Pseudohistory and Pseudoscience\", ''Science & Education'' 13: 179\u2013195, 2004</ref>\n\n=== Reception ===\nHarvey's discovery of the circulation of the blood was based on inference, not direct observation, and was incompatible with the prevailing paradigm at the time.<ref name=\":0\" />  That paradigm held, among other things, that the blood could flow from one side of the heart to the other. Harvey knew that he was facing an uphill battle:<blockquote>\"But what remains to be said about the quantity and source of the blood which thus passes, is of so novel and unheard-of character that I not only fear injury to myself from the envy of a few, but I tremble lest I have mankind at large for my enemies, so much doth want and custom, that become as another nature, and doctrine once sown and that hath struck deep root, and respect for antiquity, influence all men : still the die is cast, and my trust is in my love of truth, and the candour that inheres in cultivated minds.\"</blockquote>\nHarvey's premonitions<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Sociology of Science|last=B.

Galen believed that blood passed between the ventricles by means of invisible pores. According to Galen's views, the venous system was quite separate from the arterial system, except when they came in contact through the unseen pores. Arabic scholar [[Ibn al-Nafis]] had disputed aspects of Galen's views, providing a model that seems to imply a form of [[pulmonary circulation]] in his Commentary on Anatomy in [[Avicenna]]'s Canon (1242). Al-Nafis stated that blood moved from the heart to the lungs, where it mixed with air, and then back to the heart, from which it spread to the rest of the body.<ref>{{cite journal | pmc = 1390327 | pmid=17856795 | volume=104 | title=A FORGOTTEN CHAPTER IN THE HISTORY OF THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD | year=1936 | journal=Ann.

The [[Harveian Society of London]] is a medical society founded in 1831 based in The Medical Society of London, Chandos Street, in Cavendish Square. The [[Royal College of Physicians]] of London holds an annual lecture established by William Harvey in 1656 called the [[Harveian Oration]]. The [[Harvey Club of London]] was founded in Canada in 1919 and is based in the [[University of Western Ontario]]. The [[Harvey Society]], found in 1905, is based in New York City and hosts an annual lecture series on recent advances in biomedical sciences.\n\n== Personality ==\nIn terms of his personality, information shows that William Harvey was seen as a \"...humorous but extremely precise man...\",{{sfn|Power|p=145}} how he was often so immersed in his own thoughts that he would often suffer from [[insomnia]] (cured with a simple walk through the house), and how he was always ready for an open and direct conversation. He also loved the darkness, for it is said that it was there where \"...he could best contemplate\", thus sometimes hiding out in caves. A heavy drinker of coffee, Harvey would walk out combing his hair every morning full of energy and enthusiastic spirit through the fields. We have also come to understand Harvey's somewhat unorthodox method of dealing with his [[gout]], here cited completely: \"...his [Harvey's] cure was thus: he would sit with his legs bare...put them into a pail of water till he was almost dead with cold, then betake himself to his stove, and so 'twas gone\".{{sfn|Power|p=144}} Apart from the already mentioned love of literature, Harvey was also an intense and dedicated observer of [[bird watching|birds]] during his free time: several long and detailed passages of citations could be written delineating his observations in such places as the \"[[Pile of Boulders]]\" (a small island in Lancashire) and '[[Bass Rock]]' (island off the East Coast of [[Scotland]]).{{fact|date=January 2019}}\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nImage:William Harvey ( 1578-1657).jpg|William Harvey\nImage:William Harvey-Foto.jpg | Color portrait\nImage:SS-harvey.jpg | William Harvey, after a painting by [[Cornelius Jansen]]\nImage:William Harvey.jpg| William Harvey\n</gallery>\n\n==Works==\n* {{cite book |author=Harvey, William |title=On the Motion of the Heart and Blood in Animals |publisher=George Bell and Sons |location=London |year=1889 |url=https://archive.org/details/onmotionheartan00harvgoog|quote=william harvey. }}\n* {{cite book |author1=Harvey, William |author2=Franklin, Kenneth J.

Initially he told her that he was a wizard and had come to discuss the Craft with her, and asked whether she had a familiar. She put down a saucer of milk and called to a toad which came out and drank the milk. He then sent her out to fetch some ale, and killed the toad and dissected it, concluding that it was a perfectly ordinary animal and not supernatural in any way. When the woman returned she was naturally very angry and upset, but Harvey eventually silenced her by stating that he was the King's Physician, sent to discover whether she were a witch, and if she were, to have her apprehended.<ref>''Selected Writings of Joseph Needham'' ed Mansell Davies</ref>\n\n===Excursions abroad, election as physician to Charles I and the English Civil War===\nAt the age of fifty-two, Harvey received commands by the king to accompany the [[Duke of Lennox]] during his trip abroad. This voyage \u2013 the first after Harvey's return from [[Padua]] \u2013 lasted three years, taking Harvey through the countries of France and Spain during the [[Mantuan War]] and [[Plague (disease)|Plague]]. During this journey he wrote to [[Viscount Dorchester]]:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"I can complain that by the way we could scarce see a dog, crow, kite, raven or any other bird, or anything to anatomize, only some few miserable people, the relics of the war and the plague where famine had made anatomies before I came. It is scarce credible in so rich, populous, and plentiful countries as these were that so much misery and desolation, poverty and famine should in so short a time be, as we have seen. I interpret it well that it will be a great motive for all here to have and procure assurance of settled [[peace]]. It is time to leave fighting when there is nothing to eat, nothing to be kept, and nothing to be gotten\".{{sfn|Power|pp=85\u201386}}\n</blockquote>\n\nHaving returned to England in 1632. Harvey accompanied King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] wherever he went as 'Physician in Ordinary'.  In particular, Charles's hunting expeditions gave Harvey access to many deer carcasses; it was upon them that Harvey made many observations and developed his theories. Harvey returned to Italy in October 1636, dining at the English College, Rome, as a guest of the Jesuits there. It is possible he met Galileo in Florence en route.<ref>[[Edward Chaney]], ''The Grand Tour and the Great Rebellion: Richard Lassels and 'The Voyage of Italy' in the Seventeenth Century'' (Geneva-Turin, 1985), pp. 291\u201393.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[English Civil War]] a mob of citizen-soldiers opposed to the King entered Harvey's lodgings, stole his goods, and scattered his papers. The papers consisted of \"the records of a large number of dissections ... of diseased bodies, with his observations on the development on insects, and a series of notes on comparative anatomy.\"{{sfn|Power|p=125}} During this period, Harvey maintained his position, helped the wounded on several occasions and protected the King's children during the [[Battle of Edgehill]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Stewart|first=D.|date=1946|title=Harvey and the Battle of Edgehill|journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal|volume=55|issue=4|pages=405|pmid=20323936|pmc=1583020}}</ref>\n\nThe conflicts of the Civil War soon led King Charles to [[Oxford]], with Harvey attending, where the physician was made \"Doctor of Physic\" in 1642 and later [[Warden (college)|Warden]] of [[Merton College]] in 1645. \"In [[Oxford]] he (Harvey) very soon settled down to his accustomed pursuits, unmindful of the clatter of arms and of the constant marching and countermarching around him, for the city remained the base of operations until its surrender... \"{{sfn|Power|p=130}}\n\n===Harvey's later years, death and burial===\nThe surrender of Oxford in 1645 marks the beginning of Harvey's gradual retirement from public life and duties. Now sixty-eight years old and childless, Harvey had lost three brothers and his wife by this time. He thus decided to return to London, and lived with his brothers Eliab and Daniel at different periods. Having retired from [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]] and his various other aforementioned positions, he passed most of this time reading general literature. Several attempts to bring Harvey back into the 'working world' were made, however; here is an excerpt of one of Harvey's answers:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"Would you be the man who should recommend me to quit the peaceful haven where I now pass my life and launch again upon the faithless sea? You know full well what a storm my former lucubrations raised. Much better is it oftentimes to grow wise at home and in private, than by publishing what you have amassed with infinite labour, to stir up tempests that may rob you of peace and quiet for the rest of your days.\"{{sfn|Power|pp=150\u2013151}}\n</blockquote>\n\nHarvey died at [[Roehampton]] in the house of his brother Eliab on 3 June 1657. Descriptions of the event seem to show that he died of a [[cerebral haemorrhage]] from vessels long injured by [[gout]]: it is highly probable that the left [[middle cerebral artery]] malfunctioned, leading to a gradual accumulation of blood in the brain which eventually overwhelmed it. There exists a fairly detailed account of what happened on that day.  Harvey\n\n<blockquote>\n\"went to speak and found that he had the dead palsy in his tongue; then he saw what was to become of him. He knew there were then no hopes of his recovery, so presently he sends for his young nephews to come up to him. He then made signs (for seized with the dead palsy in his tongue he could not speak) to let him blood his tongue, which did him little or no good, and so ended his days, dying in the evening of the day on which he was stricken, the palsy giving him an easy passport.\"{{sfn|Power|pp=166\u2013167}}\n</blockquote>\n\nHis [[will (law)|will]] distributed his material goods and wealth throughout his extended family and also left a substantial amount of money to the [[Royal College of Physicians]].\n\nHarvey was buried in [[Hempstead, Essex|Hempstead]], Essex. The funeral procession started on 26 June 1657, leading Harvey to be placed in the 'Harvey Chapel' built by Eliab. The conditions of Harvey's burial are also known: \"Harvey was laid in the chapel between the bodies of his two nieces, and like them he was lapt in lead, coffin less\".{{sfn|Power|p=169}} On [[St. Luke's Day]], 18 October 1883, Harvey's remains were reinterred, the leaden case carried from the vault by eight Fellows of the [[College of Physicians]], and deposited in a sarcophagus containing his works and an inscription:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"The body of William Harvey lapt in lead, simply soldered, was laid without shell or enclosure of any kind in the Harvey vault of this Church of [[Hempstead, Essex|Hempstead]], Essex, in June 1657. In the course of time the lead enclosing the remains was, from expose and natural decay, so seriously damaged as to endanger its preservation, rendering some repair of it the duty of those interested in the memory of the illustrious discoverer of the circulation of the Blood. The [[Royal College of Physicians]], of which corporate body Harvey was a munificent Benefactor did in the years 1882\u20131883, by permission of the Representatives of the Harvey family, undertake this duty. In accordance with this determination the leaden mortuary chest containing the remains of Harvey was repaired, and was, as far as possible, restored to its original state... \"{{sfn|Power|pp=174\u2013175}}\n</blockquote>\n\n==''De Motu Cordis'' (''Anatomical Account of the Motion of the Heart and Blood'')==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=March 2018}}<!--also, most of this content probably should go into the book article-->\n{{main|Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus}}\n[[Image:William Harvey ( 1578-1657) Venenbild.jpg|right|thumb|An experiment from Harvey's ''de Motu Cordis'']]\n\nPublished in 1628 in the city of [[Frankfurt]] (host to an [[Frankfurt Book Fair|annual book fair]] that Harvey knew would allow immediate dispersion of his work), the 72-page ''[[Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus]]'' contains the mature account of the [[pulmonary circulation|circulation of the blood]]. Opening with a dedication to King Charles I, the [[quarto]] has 17 chapters which give a clear and connected account of the action of the heart and the consequent movement of the blood around the body in a circuit. Having only a tiny lens at his disposal, Harvey was not able to reach the adequate pictures that were attained through such microscopes used by [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]]; thus he had to resort to theory {{en dash}} and not practical evidence {{en dash}} in certain parts of his book. After the first chapter, which simply outlines past ideas and accepted rules regarding the heart and lungs, Harvey moves on to a fundamental premise to his treatise, stating that it was important to study the heart when it was active in order to truly comprehend its true movement; a task which even he found of great difficulty, as he says:\n\n<blockquote>\n \"...I found the task so truly arduous... that I was almost tempted to think... that the movement of the heart was only to be comprehended by God. For I could neither rightly perceive at first when the [[Systole (medicine)|systole]] and when the [[diastole]] took place by reason of the rapidity of the movement...\"{{sfn|Power|p=193}}\n</blockquote>\n\nThis initial thought led Harvey's ambition and assiduousness to a detailed analysis of the overall structure of the heart (studied with less hindrances in cold-blooded animals). After this, Harvey goes analyses the [[artery|arteries]], showing how their pulsation depends upon the contraction of the [[left ventricle]], while the contraction of the [[right ventricle]] propels its charge of blood into the [[pulmonary artery]]. Whilst doing this, the physician reiterates the fact that these two [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricles]] move together almost simultaneously and not independently as had been thought previously by his predecessors. This discovery was made while observing the heart of such animals as the [[eel]] and several other types of fish; indeed, the general study of countless animals was of utmost importance to the physician: among the ones already cited, one can add the study of the [[snail]], the [[invisible shrimp]], the [[chicken|chick]] before its hatching and even the pigeon. A digression to an experiment can be made to this note: using the inactive heart of a dead [[pigeon]] and placing upon it a finger wet with [[saliva]], Harvey was able to witness a transitory and yet incontrovertible pulsation. He had just witnessed the heart's ability to recover from [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Niebaeur |first1=Ashley |title=Chapter 7, Heart failure |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK2218/ |website=NCBI|publisher=Remedica |year=2004 }}</ref>\nAs early as the 17th century, William Harvey had already discerned the existence of the [[Ductus arteriosus]] and explained its relative function. Here he says, \"...in [[embryo]]s, whilst the lungs are in a state of inaction, performing no function, subject to no movement any more than if they had not been present, Nature uses the two ventricles of the heart as if they formed but one for the transmission of the blood.\"{{sfn|Power|pp=202\u2013203}} However, the apex of Harvey's work is probably the eighth chapter, in which he deals with the actual quantity of blood passing through the heart from the [[vein]]s to the arteries. Coming into conflict with [[Galen]]'s accepted view of the [[liver]] as the origin of venous blood, Harvey estimated the capacity of the heart, how much blood is expelled through each [[Muscle contraction|pump]] of the heart, and the number of times the heart beats in a half an hour. All of these estimates were purposefully low, so that people could see the vast amount of blood Galen's theory required the liver to produce. He estimated that the capacity of the heart was {{convert|1.5|impfloz|ml|lk=on}}, and that every time the heart pumps, {{frac|8}} of that blood is expelled. This led to Harvey's estimate that about {{convert|1/6|impfloz|ml}} of blood went through the heart every time it pumped. The next estimate he used was that the heart beats 1,000 times every half an hour, which gave 10 pounds 6 ounces of blood in a half an hour, and when this number was multiplied by 48 half hours in a day he realised that the liver would have to produce 498 pounds of blood in a day, more than the weight of the whole body.\n\nHaving this simple but essential mathematical proportion at hand \u2013 which proved the overall impossible aforementioned role of the liver \u2013 Harvey went on to prove how the blood circulated in a circle by means of countless experiments initially done on [[snake|serpents]] and fish: tying their veins and arteries in separate periods of time, Harvey noticed the modifications which occurred; indeed, as he tied the veins, the heart would become empty, while as he did the same to the arteries, the organ would swell up. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Billimoria |first1=Aspi |title=Pioneers in Cardiology: William Harvey |url=http://www.japi.org/june_2012/16_pic_william_harvey.html |website=JAPI}}</ref>\n\nThis process was later performed on the human body (in the image on the right): the physician tied a tight ligature onto the upper arm of a person. This would cut off blood flow from the arteries and the veins. When this was done, the arm below the [[ligature (medicine)|ligature]] was cool and pale, while above the ligature it was warm and swollen. The ligature was loosened slightly, which allowed blood from the arteries to come into the arm, since arteries are deeper in the flesh than the veins. When this was done, the opposite effect was seen in the lower arm. It was now warm and swollen. The veins were also more visible, since now they were full of blood. Harvey then noticed little bumps in the veins, which he realised were the [[Vein valve|valves of the veins]] discovered by his teacher, [[Hieronymus Fabricius]]. Harvey tried to push blood in the vein down the arm, but to no avail. When he tried to push it up the arm, it moved quite easily. The same effect was seen in other veins of the body, except the veins in the neck. Those veins were different from the others \u2013 they did not allow blood to flow up, but only down. This led Harvey to believe that the veins allowed blood to flow to the heart, and the valves maintained the one way flow.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Friedland |first1=Gerald |title=Discovery of the function of the heart and circulation of blood |pmc=3721262 }}</ref>\n\nContrary to a popular misconception, Harvey did not predict the existence of [[capillary|capillaries]]. His observations convinced him that direct connection between veins and arteries are unnecessary; he wrote \"blood permeates the pores\" in the flesh and it is \"absorbed and imbibed from every part\" by the veins.<ref>As cited in: Douglas Allchin, \"Pseudohistory and Pseudoscience\", ''Science & Education'' 13: 179\u2013195, 2004</ref>\n\n=== Reception ===\nHarvey's discovery of the circulation of the blood was based on inference, not direct observation, and was incompatible with the prevailing paradigm at the time.<ref name=\":0\" />  That paradigm held, among other things, that the blood could flow from one side of the heart to the other. Harvey knew that he was facing an uphill battle:<blockquote>\"But what remains to be said about the quantity and source of the blood which thus passes, is of so novel and unheard-of character that I not only fear injury to myself from the envy of a few, but I tremble lest I have mankind at large for my enemies, so much doth want and custom, that become as another nature, and doctrine once sown and that hath struck deep root, and respect for antiquity, influence all men : still the die is cast, and my trust is in my love of truth, and the candour that inheres in cultivated minds.\"</blockquote>\nHarvey's premonitions<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Sociology of Science|last=B.

Galen believed that blood passed between the ventricles by means of invisible pores. According to Galen's views, the venous system was quite separate from the arterial system, except when they came in contact through the unseen pores. Arabic scholar [[Ibn al-Nafis]] had disputed aspects of Galen's views, providing a model that seems to imply a form of [[pulmonary circulation]] in his Commentary on Anatomy in [[Avicenna]]'s Canon (1242). Al-Nafis stated that blood moved from the heart to the lungs, where it mixed with air, and then back to the heart, from which it spread to the rest of the body.<ref>{{cite journal | pmc = 1390327 | pmid=17856795 | volume=104 | title=A FORGOTTEN CHAPTER IN THE HISTORY OF THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD | year=1936 | journal=Ann.

He also loved the darkness, for it is said that it was there where \"...he could best contemplate\", thus sometimes hiding out in caves. A heavy drinker of coffee, Harvey would walk out combing his hair every morning full of energy and enthusiastic spirit through the fields. We have also come to understand Harvey's somewhat unorthodox method of dealing with his [[gout]], here cited completely: \"...his [Harvey's] cure was thus: he would sit with his legs bare...put them into a pail of water till he was almost dead with cold, then betake himself to his stove, and so 'twas gone\".{{sfn|Power|p=144}} Apart from the already mentioned love of literature, Harvey was also an intense and dedicated observer of [[bird watching|birds]] during his free time: several long and detailed passages of citations could be written delineating his observations in such places as the \"[[Pile of Boulders]]\" (a small island in Lancashire) and '[[Bass Rock]]' (island off the East Coast of [[Scotland]]).{{fact|date=January 2019}}\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nImage:William Harvey ( 1578-1657).jpg|William Harvey\nImage:William Harvey-Foto.jpg | Color portrait\nImage:SS-harvey.jpg | William Harvey, after a painting by [[Cornelius Jansen]]\nImage:William Harvey.jpg| William Harvey\n</gallery>\n\n==Works==\n* {{cite book |author=Harvey, William |title=On the Motion of the Heart and Blood in Animals |publisher=George Bell and Sons |location=London |year=1889 |url=https://archive.org/details/onmotionheartan00harvgoog|quote=william harvey. }}\n* {{cite book |author1=Harvey, William |author2=Franklin, Kenneth J.
