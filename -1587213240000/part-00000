It was written by [[Dahvi Waller]] and Matthew Weiner and directed by [[Jennifer Getzinger]]. The episode originally aired on the [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] channel in the United States on August 30, 2009.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe creative department at [[Sterling Cooper]] is told they have to work the weekend to generate new concepts that are needed for the [[Bacardi 151|Bacardi]] rum account. [[Paul Kinsey]] calls up one of his Princeton pal's to buy some marijuana to help spark the creativeness. Once the fuzz of the weed kicks in, [[Peggy Olson]] gets some inspiration for some ideas for the Bacardi pitch. Peggy, once again, proves to her colleagues how different she is from the girl we met in season one.\n\nAt [[Joan Holloway|Joan]]\u2019s, she and her husband Greg ([[Samuel Page]]) entertain the chief of surgery and another couple from Greg\u2019s hospital. Greg helps Joan set up for their guests by vacuuming, showing how Joan seems to be exerting some control within the relationship. During their dinner party, there is a reference to Greg\u2019s possible promotion to become Chief Resident. There is also a slip-up about a time Greg supposedly lost one of his patients. To take the attention off the topic, Greg forces Joan to play the accordion for their guests. Joan hides her anger as she performs, and keeps giving looks to her husband Greg.\n\nAt [[Roger Sterling]] and Jane Sterling's ([[Peyton List (actress, born 1986)|Peyton List]]) Derby Party, Roger sings \u201c[[My Old Kentucky Home]]\u201d to Jane while in blackface. [[Don Draper]] and [[Pete Campbell]] are the only ones not amused by Roger's performance, and Don asks Betty if they can leave. Don wanders off to an unattended bar where he meets [[Chelcie Ross|Conrad Hilton.]] Don and Connie share their stories about their modest beginnings, which foreshadows Connie potentially appearing again in the series. While Betty is waiting for [[Trudy Campbell]], a well groomed man approaches her and asks about her pregnancy. He says; \u201cI\u2019m going to blame this on martinis\u201d before he requests to touch her stomach. Later, Cooper and Sterling introduce Don and Betty to Henry Francis ([[Christopher Stanley]]), the man who touched Betty's stomach. After that introduction, Trudy and Pete show off the [[Charleston (dance)|Charleston]] to the guests. They dance to hide their jealousy of the Draper and Crane's talk about their pregnancy process. The Derby Party seems to have a bad ending for Don and Betty as drunken Jane reminds the Drapers of their recent separation. This upsets Betty, and she leaves Don alone with Jane. Roger sees Jane grabbing at Don's waist asking him why he doesn't like her, and sternly asks Don what's going on, then asks for a glass a milk for Jane as if he is dealing with a child. Don tells Roger that no one thinks he's happy, they think he's foolish.\n\nThe last scene is a shot of Don and Betty sharing a passionate and sincere kiss. The picture shows off their marital happiness, as if they were posing for a magazine.\n\n== Cultural references ==\n[[Sally Draper]] reads a book to Eugene Hofstadt titled ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', which was published in 1776. He warns her; \u201cYou just wait. All hell is going to break loose\u201d. Paul Kinsey quotes \u201cThis is the way the world ends. This is the way the world ends. This is the way the world ends. Not with a bang but a whimper\u201d, from the poem \u2018[[The Hollow Men|The Hollow Men\u2019]] by [[T. S. Eliot|T.S. Eliot.]] Roger Sterling sings \u201c[[My Old Kentucky Home]]\u201d in [[blackface]]. \n\nColoring one's face with black paint to perform a song and dance was a popular performance style during the nineteenth century. In 2015, as part of [[New York City]]\u2019s ongoing tribute to \u201cMad Men\" at [[Alice Tully Hall]] at [[Lincoln Center]], the show's creator Matthew Weiner. explained the discomfort surrounding the writing, and then shooting, of the scene involving Roger in blackface. Weiner stated,  \u201cThere was a lot of controversy in the writers\u2019 room.

It was written by [[Dahvi Waller]] and Matthew Weiner and directed by [[Jennifer Getzinger]]. The episode originally aired on the [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] channel in the United States on August 30, 2009.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe creative department at [[Sterling Cooper]] is told they have to work the weekend to generate new concepts that are needed for the [[Bacardi 151|Bacardi]] rum account. [[Paul Kinsey]] calls up one of his Princeton pal's to buy some marijuana to help spark the creativeness. Once the fuzz of the weed kicks in, [[Peggy Olson]] gets some inspiration for some ideas for the Bacardi pitch. Peggy, once again, proves to her colleagues how different she is from the girl we met in season one.\n\nAt [[Joan Holloway|Joan]]\u2019s, she and her husband Greg ([[Samuel Page]]) entertain the chief of surgery and another couple from Greg\u2019s hospital. Greg helps Joan set up for their guests by vacuuming, showing how Joan seems to be exerting some control within the relationship. During their dinner party, there is a reference to Greg\u2019s possible promotion to become Chief Resident. There is also a slip-up about a time Greg supposedly lost one of his patients. To take the attention off the topic, Greg forces Joan to play the accordion for their guests. Joan hides her anger as she performs, and keeps giving looks to her husband Greg.\n\nAt [[Roger Sterling]] and Jane Sterling's ([[Peyton List (actress, born 1986)|Peyton List]]) Derby Party, Roger sings \u201c[[My Old Kentucky Home]]\u201d to Jane while in blackface. [[Don Draper]] and [[Pete Campbell]] are the only ones not amused by Roger's performance, and Don asks Betty if they can leave. Don wanders off to an unattended bar where he meets [[Chelcie Ross|Conrad Hilton.]] Don and Connie share their stories about their modest beginnings, which foreshadows Connie potentially appearing again in the series. While Betty is waiting for [[Trudy Campbell]], a well groomed man approaches her and asks about her pregnancy. He says; \u201cI\u2019m going to blame this on martinis\u201d before he requests to touch her stomach. Later, Cooper and Sterling introduce Don and Betty to Henry Francis ([[Christopher Stanley]]), the man who touched Betty's stomach. After that introduction, Trudy and Pete show off the [[Charleston (dance)|Charleston]] to the guests. They dance to hide their jealousy of the Draper and Crane's talk about their pregnancy process. The Derby Party seems to have a bad ending for Don and Betty as drunken Jane reminds the Drapers of their recent separation. This upsets Betty, and she leaves Don alone with Jane. Roger sees Jane grabbing at Don's waist asking him why he doesn't like her, and sternly asks Don what's going on, then asks for a glass a milk for Jane as if he is dealing with a child. Don tells Roger that no one thinks he's happy, they think he's foolish.\n\nThe last scene is a shot of Don and Betty sharing a passionate and sincere kiss. The picture shows off their marital happiness, as if they were posing for a magazine.\n\n== Cultural references ==\n[[Sally Draper]] reads a book to Eugene Hofstadt titled ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', which was published in 1776. He warns her; \u201cYou just wait. All hell is going to break loose\u201d. Paul Kinsey quotes \u201cThis is the way the world ends. This is the way the world ends. This is the way the world ends. Not with a bang but a whimper\u201d, from the poem \u2018[[The Hollow Men|The Hollow Men\u2019]] by [[T. S. Eliot|T.S. Eliot.]] Roger Sterling sings \u201c[[My Old Kentucky Home]]\u201d in [[blackface]]. \n\nColoring one's face with black paint to perform a song and dance was a popular performance style during the nineteenth century. In 2015, as part of [[New York City]]\u2019s ongoing tribute to \u201cMad Men\" at [[Alice Tully Hall]] at [[Lincoln Center]], shows creator Matthew Weiner explained the discomfort surrounding the writing, and then shooting, of the scene involving Roger in blackface. Weiner stated,  \u201cThere was a lot of controversy in the writers\u2019 room. A lot of the writers were like, \u2018you can\u2019t do this.\u2019 I was like, \u2018Well, I think that season takes place in 1963 and blackface was not removed from the Philadelphia Police Parade until 1968 or something.\u2019 That episode is about white people and what they\u2019re like when they\u2019re alone.

In 1964, the school was renamed in Sloan's honor as the Alfred P. Sloan School of Management. In the following decades, the school grew to the point that in 2000, management became the second-largest undergraduate major at MIT. In 2005, an undergraduate minor in management was opened to 100 students each year. In 2014, the school celebrated 100 years of management education at MIT.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nSince its founding, the school has initiated many international efforts to improve regional economies and positively shape the future of global business. In the 1960s, the school played a leading role in founding the first [[Indian Institute of Management Calcutta|Indian Institute of Management]].{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} Other initiatives include the MIT-China Management Education Project, the International Faculty Fellows Program, and partnerships with [[IESE Business School]] in Spain, [[Sungkyunkwan University]] in [[South Korea]], [[Universidade Nova de Lisboa]] in [[Portugal]], the [[Skolkovo Moscow School of Management]] in Russia, and [[Tsinghua University]] in China.

Courses are taught using the [[case method]], lectures, team projects, and hands-on Action Learning Labs. The academic level of coursework is considered extremely demanding by business school standards, with a greater emphasis on analytical reasoning and [[Quantitative analysis (finance)|quantitative analysis]] than most programs.<ref name=about-mit-sloan />\n\nAcademic rigor has a strong influence on the school's culture. The first semester, also known as the core, is often considered the most difficult semester by design. Courses are graded using letter grades and on the standard five-point MIT scale. In its graduate programs, anything less than a 4.0 ('B') average will result in the student not being allowed to graduate. Unlike most business schools, MIT Sloan does not offer any academic honors at graduation, consistent with the practice throughout all of MIT. The philosophy behind this is that the 'honor' is in being an MIT graduate.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://mitsloan.mit.edu/student-blogs/mba-2015/where-we-earn-our-honors/|title = Where We Earn Our Honors|date=August 1, 2014|accessdate=August 1, 2015 |website = |publisher =MIT Sloan School of Management |last = Morales|first = Andrew}}</ref>\n\nMIT Sloan closely collaborates with other parts of MIT, in particular the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology School of Engineering|School of Engineering]], the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology School of Science|School of Science]], and the [[MIT Department of Economics|Department of Economics]].

Prior to business school, engineering is the most popular undergraduate major among students. 40% of the class is female.<ref>{{Cite web|url =http://www.cbs8.com/story/29696725/record-percentage-of-women-to-enter-mit-sloan-this-year-of-the-402-students-in-the-mba-class-of-2017-41-will-be-female-according-to-preliminary|title =Record percentage of women to enter MIT Sloan this year|accessdate =August 11, 2015|publisher =[[CBS]]|url-status =dead|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20150923221543/http://www.cbs8.com/story/29696725/record-percentage-of-women-to-enter-mit-sloan-this-year-of-the-402-students-in-the-mba-class-of-2017-41-will-be-female-according-to-preliminary|archivedate =September 23, 2015}}</ref><ref name=profile2016>{{cite web|url=http://mitsloan.mit.edu/mba/admissions/class-profile/|title=Class Profile|publisher=MIT Sloan School of Management|accessdate=December 31, 2016}}</ref>\n\nCreativity and invention are constant themes at the school. The MBA track in ''Entrepreneurship & Innovation'' features action learning labs which pair students with companies to learn how to solve complex problems relating to emerging technologies. These action learning labs include ''Entrepreneurship Lab'', ''Innovation Teams'', and ''Leading Sustainable Systems Lab''. ''Global Entrepreneurship Lab'' and ''Global Health Delivery Lab'' send MBA students to work onsite with startups in different parts of the world.

C-Functions are usually held most Thursdays in the Walker Memorial building, which is also used as the venue for many other MIT Sloan community events.

During the month of January, there are no formal classes at the school; instead, they are replaced by what is known as the [[Traditions and student activities at MIT#Independent Activities Period (IAP)|Independent Activities Period (IAP)]]. During IAP, students engage in activities that would be challenging to participate in alongside regular classes, often including international travel programs. In the middle of semesters, the MBA program has an additional, shorter gap, called the Sloan Innovation Period (SIP), focusing on intensive experiential leadership activities outside of the classroom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mitsloan.mit.edu/mba/program-components/personalized-curriculum/sip/|title=Sloan Innovation Period|publisher=MIT Sloan School of Management|date=|accessdate=August 2, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter commencement, MIT Sloan graduates wear the [[MIT class ring]], known as the ''Brass Rat''.

In 1964, the school was renamed in Sloan's honor as the Alfred P. Sloan School of Management. In the following decades, the school grew to the point that in 2000, management became the second-largest undergraduate major at MIT. In 2005, an undergraduate minor in management was opened to 100 students each year. In 2014, the school celebrated 100 years of management education at MIT.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nSince its founding, the school has initiated many international efforts to improve regional economies and positively shape the future of global business. In the 1960s, the school played a leading role in founding the first [[Indian Institute of Management Calcutta|Indian Institute of Management]].{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} Other initiatives include the MIT-China Management Education Project, the International Faculty Fellows Program, and partnerships with [[IESE Business School]] in Spain, [[Sungkyunkwan University]] in [[South Korea]], [[Universidade Nova de Lisboa]] in [[Portugal]], the [[Skolkovo Moscow School of Management]] in Russia, and [[Tsinghua University]] in China.

Courses are taught using the [[case method]], lectures, team projects, and hands-on Action Learning Labs. The academic level of coursework is considered extremely demanding by business school standards, with a greater emphasis on analytical reasoning and [[Quantitative analysis (finance)|quantitative analysis]] than most programs.<ref name=about-mit-sloan />\n\nAcademic rigor has a strong influence on the school's culture. The first semester, also known as the core, is often considered the most difficult semester by design. Courses are graded using letter grades and on the standard five-point MIT scale. In its graduate programs, anything less than a 4.0 ('B') average will result in the student not being allowed to graduate. Unlike most business schools, MIT Sloan does not offer any academic honors at graduation, consistent with the practice throughout all of MIT.

The MIT Sloan culture is similar to, but also distinct from, overall [[Traditions and student activities at MIT|MIT culture]], and is influenced most strongly by its MBA program. MBA students come from more than 60 countries every year, with just over half coming from [[North America]], and 60% holding US citizenship. Prior to business school, engineering is the most popular undergraduate major among students. 40% of the class is female.<ref>{{Cite web|url =http://www.cbs8.com/story/29696725/record-percentage-of-women-to-enter-mit-sloan-this-year-of-the-402-students-in-the-mba-class-of-2017-41-will-be-female-according-to-preliminary|title =Record percentage of women to enter MIT Sloan this year|accessdate =August 11, 2015|publisher =[[CBS]]|url-status =dead|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20150923221543/http://www.cbs8.com/story/29696725/record-percentage-of-women-to-enter-mit-sloan-this-year-of-the-402-students-in-the-mba-class-of-2017-41-will-be-female-according-to-preliminary|archivedate =September 23, 2015}}</ref><ref name=profile2016>{{cite web|url=http://mitsloan.mit.edu/mba/admissions/class-profile/|title=Class Profile|publisher=MIT Sloan School of Management|accessdate=December 31, 2016}}</ref>\n\nCreativity and invention are constant themes at the school. The MBA track in ''Entrepreneurship & Innovation'' features action learning labs which pair students with companies to learn how to solve complex problems relating to emerging technologies. These action learning labs include ''Entrepreneurship Lab'', ''Innovation Teams'', and ''Leading Sustainable Systems Lab''. ''Global Entrepreneurship Lab'' and ''Global Health Delivery Lab'' send MBA students to work onsite with startups in different parts of the world.

C-Functions are usually held most Thursdays in the Walker Memorial building, which is also used as the venue for many other MIT Sloan community events.

During the month of January, there are no formal classes at the school; instead, they are replaced by what is known as the [[Traditions and student activities at MIT#Independent Activities Period (IAP)|Independent Activities Period (IAP)]]. During IAP, students engage in activities that would be challenging to participate in alongside regular classes, often including international travel programs. In the middle of semesters, the MBA program has an additional, shorter gap, called the Sloan Innovation Period (SIP), focusing on intensive experiential leadership activities outside of the classroom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mitsloan.mit.edu/mba/program-components/personalized-curriculum/sip/|title=Sloan Innovation Period|publisher=MIT Sloan School of Management|date=|accessdate=August 2, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter commencement, MIT Sloan graduates wear the [[MIT class ring]], known as the ''Brass Rat''.
