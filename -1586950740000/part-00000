I shall not retain Belial within my heart.\"\n\nThe ''War Scroll'' and ''the Thanksgiving hymns'' both delve into the idea that Belial is accursed by God and his people, and shows how the existence of Belial in this world can be attributed to the mysteries of God since we can not know why he permits the dealings of Belial to persist.\n\nIn the ''Dead Sea Scrolls'', Belial is further contrasted with God. These are the Angel of Light and the Angel of Darkness. The Manual of Discipline identifies the Angel of Light as God himself. The Angel of Darkness is identified in the same scroll as Belial.<ref name=\"Dead Sea\"/>\n\nAlso in ''The Dead Sea Scrolls'' is a recounting of a dream of [[Amram]], the father of [[Moses]], who finds two 'watchers' contesting over him. One is Belial who is described as the King of Evil and Prince of Darkness. Belial is also mentioned in the ''Fragments of a Zadokite Work'' (which is also known as The [[Damascus Document]] (CD)), which states that during the [[eschatological]] age, \"Belial shall be let loose against Israel, as God spoke through [[Isaiah]] the prophet.\"<ref>CD 4:13</ref> The ''Fragments'' also speak of \"three nets of Belial\" which are said to be fornication, wealth, and pollution of the sanctuary.<ref>CD 4:17-18</ref> In this work, Belial is sometimes presented as an agent of divine punishment and sometimes as a rebel, as [[Mastema]] is. It was Belial who inspired the Egyptian sorcerers, Jochaneh and his brother, to oppose Moses and Aaron. The ''Fragments'' also say that anyone who is ruled by the spirits of Belial and speaks of rebellion should be condemned as a [[necromancy|necromancer]] and wizard.\n\n===Jubilees===\nIn the [[Book of Jubilees]], [[circumcision|uncircumcised]] [[Gentile]]s are called \"sons of Belial\".<ref>[http://www.pseudepigrapha.com/jubilees/15.htm Jubilees 15:32]</ref>\n\n===Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs===\nBelial is also mentioned in the [[Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs]]. The author of the work seems to be a [[dualistic cosmology|dualist]] because he presents Belial as God's opponent, not as a servant, but does not mention how or why this came to be. Simeon 5:3 says that fornication separates man from God and brings him near to Belial. Levi tells his children to choose between the Law of God and the works of Belial<ref>Levi 19:1</ref> It also states that when the soul is constantly disturbed, the Lord departs from it and Belial rules over it. Naphtali<ref>2:6, 3:1</ref> contrasts the Law and will of God with the purposes of Belial. Also, in 20:2, Joseph prophesies that when [[Israel]] leaves [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]], they will be with God in light while Belial will remain in darkness with the Egyptians. Finally, the Testament describes that when the Messiah comes, the angels will punish the spirits of deceit and Belial<ref>3:3</ref> and that the Messiah will bind Belial and give to his children the power to trample the evil spirits.<ref>18:12</ref> {{quote|1=\"For many hath fornication destroyed; because, though a man be old or noble, it maketh him a reproach and a laughing-stock with Beliar and the sons of men.\"<ref>4:7-8</ref>}}\n\n===Ascension of Isaiah===\nIn the [[Ascension of Isaiah]], Belial is the angel of [[Antinomianism|lawlessness]] and \"the ruler of this world\", and identified as [[Samael]] and [[Satan]].<ref name=\"earlychristianwritings.com\"/>\n\n{{quote|And Manasseh turned aside his heart to serve Belial; for the angel of lawlessness, who is the ruler of this world, is Belial, whose name is Matanbuchus.|(Ascension of Isaiah 2:4)<ref name=\"earlychristianwritings.com\"/>}}\n\n==Christianity==\nIn the [[New Testament]] the word occurs once, when [[Paul the Apostle]] asks:\n* \"[W]hat concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?\" ({{Bibleverse|2|Corinthians|6:15|KJV}})\n\nThe spelling found in most manuscripts of 2 Corinthians is actually ''Beliar'' (\u0392\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03ac\u03c1) not ''Belial'' (\u0392\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03b1\u03bb). This is the reading preferred by textual scholars<ref>Metzger</ref> and the change of -l to -r is attributed to a common change in Aramaic pronunciation.<ref>Neil Forsyth ''The Old Enemy: Satan and the Combat Myth'' Princeton 1987 Page 201 \"The form Beliar(c.g., 2 Cor. 6.15) is due to Syriac pronunciation.\"</ref><ref>[[Marvin R.

In ''The Satanic Bible'' (''The Book of Belial''), Belial means \"without a master\", and symbolizes independence, self-sufficiency, and personal accomplishment.\n\nIn 1937, [[Edgar Cayce]] used the term \"sons of belial\" and \"sons of the law of one\" for the first time in one of his deep trance readings given between 1923 and 1945. Cayce was often referred to as the \"sleeping prophet\" who gave over 2,500 readings to individuals while in a deep trance state.  While his definition of the sons of belial was consistent with the Hebrew meaning of \"worthless\" individuals focused on self-gratification, Cayce went on to use the term frequently to compare opposing human forces at work in pre-historical times related to the early development of [[Atlantis]].\n\n==Popular culture==\n{{main|Belial in popular culture}}\nPopular culture in the [[20th Century]] included many references to Belial; notably in the celebrated silent film ''[[Nosferatu]]'' (1922), [[Aldous Huxley]]'s novel ''[[Ape and Essence]]'' (1948), [[Philip K. Dick]]'s novel ''[[The Divine Invasion]]'' (1981), the cult horror film ''[[Basket Case (film)|Basket Case]]'' (1982), [[Dean Koontz]]'s novel ''[[Phantoms (novel)|Phantoms]]'' (1983), and [[Graham Masterton]]'s novel ''Master of Lies'' (1991). Belial has also a experienced a resurgence in popularity during the 21st Century in numerous mediums, with video games being the most prominent.\n\n* In the 2005 horror film, ''[[The Exorcism of Emily Rose]]'', Belial is featured as the Devil's representative who possesses the title character and kills the priest that eventually banishes him.\n\n* In the real time strategy game ''Dungeon Keeper'''s Deeper Dungeons expansion the final level is titled \u201cBelial\u201d.\n \n* In the role playing game ''[[Vampire: the Requiem]]'', Belial's Brood is a covenant of vampires that serve Vice and evil forces, consorting with infernal spirits for power.\n\n* [[Blizzard Entertainment]]'s video game ''[[Diablo 3]]'' has Belial function as the final boss of Act 2 in it's storyline. In the City of Caldeum, where Belial takes residence, there are definite Arabic tones for the art direction and setting in the aforementioned chapter. Also known as the \"Lord of Lies\" and the \"Master of Deception\", Belial is regarded as one of the four Lesser Evils in the mortal realm that seek to make this world an outpost of Hell itself.. \n\n* [[Westwood Studios]]'s PC game ''[[Lands of Lore: Guardians of Destiny]]'' features Belial as its main antagonist, portraying him as an evil god with a devil-like appearance.\n\n* In the ''[[Warhammer 40k]]'' universe Belial is the current Grand Master of the Deathwing of the Dark Angels Space Marine Chapter which has other characters named after bleaker Abrahamic entities, such as Samael, the poison of God, and Azrael, the Angel of Death.\n\n* In the mobile game ''Puzzle and Dragons'', Belial is a monster that is part of the Archdemon series.\n\n* In the book ''The Little Ships'' by [[J.A. Sutherland]], the main character sails in a spaceship named Belial.\n\n* \"Belial's Meat\" is a health item in the video game ''[[Off (video game)|Off]]'' by Unproductive Fun Time.\n\n* In the video game ''[[Binding of isaac (game)|Binding of Isaac]]'', the Book of Belial is an activated item.\n\n* In the mobile game ''[[Crash Fever]]'', Belial is one of the first protagonists.\n\n* In ''[[Granblue Fantasy]]'', Belial is a \"fallen angel\", appearing in the What Makes The Sky Blue 2 and 3 event(s) as one of the main antagonists.\n\n* \"Belial\" is the theme held in meditation by Vaughn Benjamin (Akae Beka) on the Midnite & Ras L Collaborative album ''Thru & True'' (2006).\n\n* Belial is referenced, among other demons, on [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]]'s 2014 studio album ''[[Esoteric Warfare]]''. Belial is mentioned in \"Pandaemon,\" the fourth track on the LP.\n\n* In Cassandra Clare's bestselling [[Shadowhunter Chronicles]], Belial is one of the [[Prince of Hell]] as well as the demonic father of a major character, Theresa Gray, who was the protagonist of [[The Infernal Devices]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of theological demons]]\n* [[Asmodai]]\n* [[Bel (mythology)|Bel]]\n* [[Demon]]\n* [[Devil]]\n* [[Samael]]\n* [[Satan]]\n* [[Serpent (Bible)|Serpent]]\n* [[Sin]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n*S.

The [[Geneva Bible]] (1560) uses \"wicked,\" and at Jg 19:22 has the marginal note \"''Ebr'' [Hebrew] ''men of Belial: that is, given to all wickednes.''\" In the KJV these occurrences are rendered with \"Belial\" capitalised:\n* \"the sons of Eli were '''sons of Belial''' \" (KJV)\nIn modern versions these are usually read as a phrase:\n*\"the sons of Eli were '''worthless men''' \" (1 Samuel 2:12, NRSV and NIV)\n*\"the wicked men of the city\" (Judges 19:22, NIV)\n\n\"Belial\" is applied to ideas, words, and counsel,<ref>De 15:9; Ps 101:3; Na 1:11</ref> to calamitous circumstances,<ref>Ps 41:8</ref> and most frequently, to worthless men of the lowest sort, such as men who would induce worship of other gods;<ref>De 13:13</ref> those of Benjamin who committed the sex crime at Gibeah;<ref>Jg 19:22-27; 20:13</ref> the wicked sons of Eli;<ref>1Sa 2:12</ref> insolent Nabal;<ref>1Sa 25:17, 25</ref> opposers of [[God in Judaism|God]]\u2019s anointed, David;<ref>2Sa 20:1; 22:5; 23:6; Ps 18:4</ref> Rehoboam's unsteady associates;<ref>2Ch 13:7</ref> Jezebel's conspirators against Naboth;<ref>1Ki 21:10, 13</ref> and men in general who stir up contention.<ref>Pr 6:12-14; 16:27; 19:28</ref> Indicating that the enemy power would no longer interfere with the carrying out of true worship by his people in their land, YHWH declared through his prophet: \"No more will any worthless person pass again through you.

I shall not retain Belial within my heart.\"\n\nThe ''War Scroll'' and ''the Thanksgiving hymns'' both delve into the idea that Belial is accursed by God and his people, and shows how the existence of Belial in this world can be attributed to the mysteries of God since we can not know why he permits the dealings of Belial to persist.\n\nIn the ''Dead Sea Scrolls'', Belial is further contrasted with God. These are the Angel of Light and the Angel of Darkness. The Manual of Discipline identifies the Angel of Light as God himself. The Angel of Darkness is identified in the same scroll as Belial.<ref name=\"Dead Sea\"/>\n\nAlso in ''The Dead Sea Scrolls'' is a recounting of a dream of [[Amram]], the father of [[Moses]], who finds two 'watchers' contesting over him. One is Belial who is described as the King of Evil and Prince of Darkness. Belial is also mentioned in the ''Fragments of a Zadokite Work'' (which is also known as The [[Damascus Document]] (CD)), which states that during the [[eschatological]] age, \"Belial shall be let loose against Israel, as God spoke through [[Isaiah]] the prophet.\"<ref>CD 4:13</ref> The ''Fragments'' also speak of \"three nets of Belial\" which are said to be fornication, wealth, and pollution of the sanctuary.<ref>CD 4:17-18</ref> In this work, Belial is sometimes presented as an agent of divine punishment and sometimes as a rebel, as [[Mastema]] is. It was Belial who inspired the Egyptian sorcerers, Jochaneh and his brother, to oppose Moses and Aaron. The ''Fragments'' also say that anyone who is ruled by the spirits of Belial and speaks of rebellion should be condemned as a [[necromancy|necromancer]] and wizard.\n\n===Jubilees===\nIn the [[Book of Jubilees]], [[circumcision|uncircumcised]] [[Gentile]]s are called \"sons of Belial\".<ref>[http://www.pseudepigrapha.com/jubilees/15.htm Jubilees 15:32]</ref>\n\n===Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs===\nBelial is also mentioned in the [[Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs]]. The author of the work seems to be a [[dualistic cosmology|dualist]] because he presents Belial as God's opponent, not as a servant, but does not mention how or why this came to be. Simeon 5:3 says that fornication separates man from God and brings him near to Belial. Levi tells his children to choose between the Law of God and the works of Belial<ref>Levi 19:1</ref> It also states that when the soul is constantly disturbed, the Lord departs from it and Belial rules over it. Naphtali<ref>2:6, 3:1</ref> contrasts the Law and will of God with the purposes of Belial. Also, in 20:2, Joseph prophesies that when [[Israel]] leaves [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]], they will be with God in light while Belial will remain in darkness with the Egyptians. Finally, the Testament describes that when the Messiah comes, the angels will punish the spirits of deceit and Belial<ref>3:3</ref> and that the Messiah will bind Belial and give to his children the power to trample the evil spirits.<ref>18:12</ref> {{quote|1=\"For many hath fornication destroyed; because, though a man be old or noble, it maketh him a reproach and a laughing-stock with Beliar and the sons of men.\"<ref>4:7-8</ref>}}\n\n===Ascension of Isaiah===\nIn the [[Ascension of Isaiah]], Belial is the angel of [[Antinomianism|lawlessness]] and \"the ruler of this world\", and identified as [[Samael]] and [[Satan]].<ref name=\"earlychristianwritings.com\"/>\n\n{{quote|And Manasseh turned aside his heart to serve Belial; for the angel of lawlessness, who is the ruler of this world, is Belial, whose name is Matanbuchus.|(Ascension of Isaiah 2:4)<ref name=\"earlychristianwritings.com\"/>}}\n\n==Christianity==\nIn the [[New Testament]] the word occurs once, when [[Paul the Apostle]] asks:\n* \"[W]hat concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?\" ({{Bibleverse|2|Corinthians|6:15|KJV}})\n\nThe spelling found in most manuscripts of 2 Corinthians is actually ''Beliar'' (\u0392\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03ac\u03c1) not ''Belial'' (\u0392\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03b1\u03bb). This is the reading preferred by textual scholars<ref>Metzger</ref> and the change of -l to -r is attributed to a common change in Aramaic pronunciation.<ref>Neil Forsyth ''The Old Enemy: Satan and the Combat Myth'' Princeton 1987 Page 201 \"The form Beliar(c.g., 2 Cor. 6.15) is due to Syriac pronunciation.\"</ref><ref>[[Marvin R.

In ''The Satanic Bible'' (''The Book of Belial''), Belial means \"without a master\", and symbolizes independence, self-sufficiency, and personal accomplishment.\n\nIn 1937, [[Edgar Cayce]] used the term \"sons of belial\" and \"sons of the law of one\" for the first time in one of his deep trance readings given between 1923 and 1945. Cayce was often referred to as the \"sleeping prophet\" who gave over 2,500 readings to individuals while in a deep trance state.  While his definition of the sons of belial was consistent with the Hebrew meaning of \"worthless\" individuals focused on self-gratification, Cayce went on to use the term frequently to compare opposing human forces at work in pre-historical times related to the early development of [[Atlantis]].\n\n==Popular culture==\n{{main|Belial in popular culture}}\nPopular culture in the [[20th Century]] included many references to Belial; notably in the celebrated silent film ''[[Nosferatu]]'' (1922), [[Aldous Huxley]]'s novel ''[[Ape and Essence]]'' (1948), [[Philip K. Dick]]'s novel ''[[The Divine Invasion]]'' (1981), the cult horror film ''[[Basket Case (film)|Basket Case]]'' (1982), [[Dean Koontz]]'s novel ''[[Phantoms (novel)|Phantoms]]'' (1983), and [[Graham Masterton]]'s novel ''Master of Lies'' (1991). Belial has also a experienced a resurgence in popularity during the 21st Century in numerous mediums, with video games being the most prominent.\n\n* In the 2005 horror film, ''[[The Exorcism of Emily Rose]]'', Belial is featured as the Devil's representative who possesses the title character and kills the priest that eventually banishes him.\n\n* In the real time strategy game ''Dungeon Keeper'''s Deeper Dungeons expansion the final level is titled \u201cBelial\u201d.\n \n* In the role playing game ''[[Vampire: the Requiem]]'', Belial's Brood is a covenant of vampires that serve Vice and evil forces, consorting with infernal spirits for power.\n\n* [[Blizzard Entertainment]]'s video game ''[[Diablo 3]]'' has Belial function as the final boss of Act 2  in it's storyline. There are definite Arabic tones for the art direction and setting. Belia (also known as the \"Lord of Lies\" and the \"Master fo Deception\") one of the four Lesser Evils in the world of Sanctuary. \n\n* [[Westwood Studios]]'s PC game ''[[Lands of Lore: Guardians of Destiny]]'' features Belial as its main antagonist, portraying him as an evil god with a devil-like appearance.\n\n* In the ''[[Warhammer 40k]]'' universe Belial is the current Grand Master of the Deathwing of the Dark Angels Space Marine Chapter which has other characters named after bleaker Abrahamic entities, such as Samael, the poison of God, and Azrael, the Angel of Death.\n\n* In the mobile game ''Puzzle and Dragons'', Belial is a monster that is part of the Archdemon series.\n\n* In the book ''The Little Ships'' by [[J.A.

Belial is mentioned in \"Pandaemon,\" the fourth track on the LP.\n\n* In Cassandra Clare's bestselling [[Shadowhunter Chronicles]], Belial is one of the [[Prince of Hell]] as well as the demonic father of a major character, Theresa Gray, who was the protagonist of [[The Infernal Devices]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of theological demons]]\n* [[Asmodai]]\n* [[Bel (mythology)|Bel]]\n* [[Demon]]\n* [[Devil]]\n* [[Samael]]\n* [[Satan]]\n* [[Serpent (Bible)|Serpent]]\n* [[Sin]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n*S.

It is one of the largest paved squares in the United Kingdom.\n\nLocated in the heart of [[Nottingham City Centre]], the square is bounded by [[Beastmarket Hill]] to the West, [[Long Row]] to the North, and [[South Parade, Nottingham|South Parade]] to the South. The Eastern end of the square is dominated by the [[Nottingham Council House|Council House]], which served as Nottingham's [[town hall]] until 2010.<ref>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loxley_House,_Nottingham Loxley House]</ref>\n\nThe nature of the square means it is often used for large local events, fairs, concerts and exhibitions.\n\n==History==\nThe early market square, from the 11th Century until 1928, covered an area of about 5.5 acres (22,260 square metres), with its narrow western edge near Mount Street, broadening out to its eastern edge, adjacent to High Street. The perimeter then, being formed by what is now: [[Long Row|Long Row West]], [[Long Row]], [[Long Row|Long Row East]], High Street, [[Poultry, Nottingham|Poultry]], [[South Parade, Nottingham|South Parade]], [[Beastmarket Hill]], and Angel Row.<ref>[https://nottinghamhiddenhistoryteam.wordpress.com/2014/01/02/nottinghams-old-market-square/ Hidden History]</ref> Because of its size during these several centuries, it was frequently referred to as the, 'Great Market Place'.<ref>[http://www.nottshistory.org.uk/articles/tts/tts1931/itinerary1931p2.htm Thoroton]</ref>\n\nThis [[public square]] has long been at the centre of Nottingham life. In the early days before the [[City of Nottingham]] was formed, the area was the centre-point between the [[Normans|Norman]] town of Nottingham, situated around the Castle Rock, and the old [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] town which was based around the current [[Lace Market]] at [[St. Mary's Church, Nottingham|St. Mary's Church]], also called Snothryngham, Snottingaham or Snottingham.<ref>[http://www.nottshistory.org.uk/swinnerton1910/chapter1.htm Nottinghamshire history > Cambridge County Geographies: Nottinghamshire, (1910)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The central point between the two towns became a major market point, and hence the square has been at the centre of Nottingham's growth around it for hundreds of years since. The two towns were once divided by a wall. The old positioning of this historic wall was reinstated when the square was redesigned in the 2000s, with a stainless steel drainage channel down the centre of the Square. This marks the Wall that divided the livestock from the agricultural feed and foodstuffs.\n\nThe square was the original setting of [[Nottingham Goose Fair]], an annual fair held in October originating over 700 years ago.

It is one of the largest paved squares in the United Kingdom.\n\nLocated in the heart of [[Nottingham City Centre]], the square is bounded by [[Beastmarket Hill]] to the West, [[Long Row]] to the North, and [[South Parade, Nottingham|South Parade]] to the South. The Eastern end of the square is dominated by the [[Nottingham Council House|Council House]], which served as Nottingham's [[town hall]] until 2010.<ref>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loxley_House,_Nottingham Loxley House]</ref>\n\nThe nature of the square means it is often used for large local events, fairs, concerts and exhibitions.\n\n==History==\nThe early market square, from the 11th Century until 1928, covered an area of about 5.5 acres (22,260 square metres), with its narrow western edge near Mount Street, broadening out to its eastern edge, adjacent to High Street. The perimeter then, being formed by what is now: [[Long Row|Long Row West]], [[Long Row]], [[Long Row|Long Row East]], High Street, [[Poultry, Nottingham|Poultry]], [[South Parade, Nottingham|South Parade]], [[Beastmarket Hill]], and Angel Row.<ref>[https://nottinghamhiddenhistoryteam.wordpress.com/2014/01/02/nottinghams-old-market-square/ Hidden History]</ref> Because of its size during these several centuries, it was frequently referred to as the, 'Great Market Place'.<ref>[http://www.nottshistory.org.uk/articles/tts/tts1931/itinerary1931p2.htm Thoroton]</ref>\n\nThe square has long been at the centre of Nottingham life. In the early days before the [[City of Nottingham]] was formed, the area was the centre-point between the [[Normans|Norman]] town of Nottingham, situated around the Castle Rock, and the old [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] town which was based around the current [[Lace Market]] at [[St. Mary's Church, Nottingham|St. Mary's Church]], also called Snothryngham, Snottingaham or Snottingham.<ref>[http://www.nottshistory.org.uk/swinnerton1910/chapter1.htm Nottinghamshire history > Cambridge County Geographies: Nottinghamshire, (1910)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The central point between the two towns became a major market point, and hence the square has been at the centre of Nottingham's growth around it for hundreds of years since. The two towns were once divided by a wall. The old positioning of this historic wall was reinstated when the square was redesigned in the 2000s, with a stainless steel drainage channel down the centre of the Square. This marks the Wall that divided the livestock from the agricultural feed and foodstuffs.\n\nThe square was the original setting of [[Nottingham Goose Fair]], an annual fair held in October originating over 700 years ago. The Goose Fair was moved in 1928 for redevelopment of the square.\n\nThe square was the location of [[Smith's Bank]] which, established in 1688, was the earliest provincial bank in England.

They were sold and transferred to industrial concerns and public sectors in huge numbers, but have IR road numbers on them.\n\n== Some of the sheds holding WDS-6/AD locomotives ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Bardhaman railway station|Bardhaman]]- 2\n* [[Bokaro Steel City railway station|Bokaro Steel City]]- 11\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed, Ernakulam|Ernakulam]]- 1\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed, Erode|Erode]]- 6\n* [[Gonda, Uttar Pradesh|Gonda]]- 4\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed, Guntakal|Guntakal]]- 3 \n* [[Guwahati railway station|New Guwahati]]- 12\n* [[Howrah Junction railway station|Howrah]]- 18\n* [[Itarsi Junction railway station|Itarsi]]- 18\n* [[Jamalpur railway station|Jamalpur]]- 2\n* [[Jhansi Junction railway station|Jhansi]]- 11\n* [[Katni railway station|Katni]]- 3\n* [[Kazipet railway station|Kazipet]]- 1\n* [[Krishnarajapuram railway station|Krishnarajapuram]]- 3\n* [[Lucknow Charbagh railway station|Lucknow]]- 4\n* [[Mughalsarai Junction railway station|Mughalsarai]]- 13\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed, Golden Rock|Golden Rock]]- 1\n* [[Raipur Junction railway station|Raipur]]- 20\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed, Ratlam|Ratlam]]- 7\n* [[Shakur Basti (Delhi Assembly constituency)|Shakurbasti]]- 21\n* [[Tughlakabad railway station|Tughlakabad]]- 12\n* [[Vatva (Vidhan Sabha constituency)|Vatva]]- 17\n* [[Vijayawada Junction railway station|Vijayawada]]- 5\n* [[Visakhapatnam railway station|Visakhapatnam]]- 10\n*'''Loco Shed Izzatnagar-''' 1 \n*'''Loco Shed Unknown-''' 13 \n*'''Loco Shed Kharagpur-''' 17\n*'''Loco Shed Kurla-''' 51\n*'''Loco Shed Bondamunda-''' 8\n*'''Loco Shed Beliaghata Sealdah-''' 27\n*'''Loco Shed Andal-''' 6\n*'''Loco Shed Bandra Marshalling Yard-''' 24 \n*'''Loco Shed Gandhidham-''' 4\n*'''Loco Shed Patratu-''' 5\n*'''Loco Shed Ludhiana-''' 3\n*'''Loco Shed Tondiarpet-''' 12 <br />\n'''Total active Locomotives in service till March 2020:''' 378 \n}}\n'''Source-'''https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/list?list_type=named\n\n== Technical specifications ==\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-loco2d.html|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways FAQ: Locomotives -- Specific classes : AC Electric|website=www.irfca.org}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Manufacturers\n|DLW, Parel Workshop\n|-\n|Engine\n|Alco 251-D, [[Straight-six engine|Inline-6]], {{convert|1,400|hp|abbr=on|lk=on}} ({{convert|1,300|hp|abbr=on|disp=or}} site rating) with Alco turbocharged engine. 1,100&nbsp;rpm max, 400&nbsp;rpm idle; {{convert|228|x|267|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} bore x stroke; compression ratio 12.5:1.\n|-\n|Transmission\n|Electric, DC-DC (DC Generator and DC Traction motor) \n|-\n|[[Traction motor]]s\n|GE for original Alco and MLW models, BHEL for DLW\n|-\n|-\n|[[Axle load]]\n|{{convert|21|t|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|total weight\n|{{convert|113|t|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|[[Bogie]]s\n|Alco design cast frame trimount ([[Co-Co engine|Co-Co]]) bogies \n|-\n|Starting TE\n|{{convert|34|t|abbr=on}}, at adhesion 27%\n|-\n|Length over [[buffer beam]]s\n|{{convert|17,370|mm|ftin|abbr=on|frac=8}}\n|-\n|Distance between [[bogie]]s\n|{{convert|10,516|mm|ftin|abbr=on|frac=8}}\n|}\n==Other Shunting Locomotives of Indian Railway==\n'''WDS-2:''' 30 produced - All are out of Service.<br />\n'''WDS-4:''' 662 produced - 11 are active in service.<br />\n'''WDS-5:''' 21 produced - 4 are active in service. <br />(April data is N/A so, don't change the data keep it as it is)\n<br />'''Source-''' https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/list?list_type=named\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[History of rail transport in India]]\n* [[Locomotives of India]]\n* [[Rail transport in India]]\n* [[YDM-4|Indian locomotive class YDM-4]]\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{Hughes-IndianLocos4}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*https://rdso.indianrailways.gov.in/works/uploads/File/WDS6.PDF\n*https://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-loco2d.html\n*https://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-specs.html#WDS-6\n*https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/list\n{{commons category|Indian locomotive class WDS6}}\n\n{{Broad gauge locomotives of India |state=open}}\n\n[[Category:Diesel-electric locomotives of India]]\n[[Category:Co-Co locomotives]]\n[[Category:DLW locomotives]]\n[[Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1975]]\n[[Category:5 ft 6 in gauge locomotives]]\n", "name_user": "Suvadeep Saha56", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eOther Shunting Locomotives of Indian Railway:corrected it.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_locomotive_class_WDS-6"}

More important, however, was the prologue, which comprised sung dialogue between [[Allegory|allegorical]] characters which introduced the overarching themes of the stories depicted {{harv|Carter|n.d.}}.\n\n====French overture====\nAs a [[musical form]], however, the [[French overture]] first appears in the court ballet and operatic overtures of [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] {{harv|Waterman and Anthony|2001}}, which he elaborated from a similar, two-section form called ''Ouverture'', found in the French [[ballets de cour]] as early as 1640 {{harv|Temperley|2001}}. This French overture consists of a slow introduction in a marked \"dotted rhythm\" (i.e., exaggerated [[Iamb (foot)|iambic]], if the first chord is disregarded), followed by a lively movement in [[fugato]] style. The overture was frequently followed by a series of dance tunes before the curtain rose, and would often return following the Prologue to introduce the action proper. This ouverture style was also used in English opera, most notably in [[Henry Purcell]]'s ''[[Dido and \u00c6neas]]''. Its distinctive rhythmic profile and function thus led to the French overture style as found in the works of late Baroque composers such as [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[Georg Friedrich H\u00e4ndel]], and [[Georg Philipp Telemann]]. The style is most often used in [[Prelude (music)|prelude]]s to [[suite (music)|suite]]s, and can be found in non-staged vocal works such as [[cantata]]s, for example in the opening chorus of [[Bach cantata|Bach's cantata]] ''[[Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland, BWV 61]]''. [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] also uses the French overture form in some of his Italian operas such as ''[[Giulio Cesare]]'' {{harv|Burrows|2012|loc={{Page needed|date=June 2013}}}}.\n\n====Italian overture====\n{{Main article|Italian overture}}\nIn Italy, a distinct form called \"overture\" arose in the 1680s, and became established particularly through the operas of [[Alessandro Scarlatti]], and spread throughout Europe, supplanting the French form as the standard operatic overture by the mid-18th century {{harv|Fisher|2001}}. Its stereotypical form is in three generally [[homophony|homophonic]] [[Movement (music)|movements]]: fast\u2013slow\u2013fast. The opening movement was normally in duple metre and in a major key; the slow movement in earlier examples was usually quite short, and could be in a contrasting key; the concluding movement was dance-like, most often with rhythms of the [[gigue]] or [[minuet]], and returned to the key of the opening section. As the form evolved, the first movement often incorporated fanfare-like elements and took on the pattern of so-called \"sonatina form\" ([[sonata form]] without a development section), and the slow section became more extended and lyrical {{harv|Fisher|2001}}. Italian overtures were often detached from their operas and played as independent concert pieces.{{by whom|date=February 2013}} In this context, they became important in the early history of the [[symphony]] {{harv|Larue|2001}}.\n\n=== 18th century ===\nPrior to the 18th century, the symphony and the overture were almost interchangeable, with overtures being extracted from operas to serve as stand-alone instrumental works, and symphonies were tagged to the front of operas as overtures {{harv|Taruskin|n.d.|loc={{Page needed|date=November 2016}}}}. With the reform of ''opera seria,'' the overture began to distinguish itself from the symphony, and composers began to link the content of overtures to their operas dramatically and emotionally.  Elements from the opera are foreshadowed in the overture, following the reform ideology that the music and every other element on stages serves to enhance the plot.  One such overture was that of ''[[La Magnifique]]'' by Andr\u00e9-Ernest-Modeste Gr\u00e9try, in which several of the arias are quoted {{harv|Charlton and Bartlet|n.d.}}. This \"[[Medley (music)|medley]] form\" persists in the overtures to many works of [[musical theatre]] written in the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\n===19th-century opera===\nIn 19th-century opera the overture, ''Vorspiel'', ''Einleitung,'' Introduction, or whatever else it may be called, is generally nothing more definite than that portion of the music which takes place before the curtain rises. [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''Vorspiel'' to ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'' is a short self-contained movement founded on the music of the Grail.\n\nIn Italian opera after about 1800, the \"overture\" became known as the ''sinfonia'' {{harv|Fisher|1998}}. Fisher also notes the term ''Sinfonia avanti l'opera'' (literally, the \"symphony before the opera\") was \"an early term for a sinfonia used to begin an opera, that is, as an overture as opposed to one serving to begin a later section of the work\" {{harv|Fisher|1998}}.\n\n==Concert overture==\n\n===Early 19th century===\nAlthough by the end of the eighteenth century opera overtures were already beginning to be performed as separate items in the concert hall,  the \"concert overture\", intended specifically as an individual concert piece without reference to stage performance and generally based  on some literary theme, began to appear early in the [[Romantic era]]. [[Carl Maria von Weber]] wrote two concert overtures, ''Der Beherrscher der Geister'' ('The Ruler of the Spirits', 1811, a revision of the overture to his unfinished opera ''[[R\u00fcbezahl]]'' of 1805), and ''Jubel-Ouvert\u00fcre'' ('Jubilee Overture', 1818, incorporating ''[[God Save the King]]'' at its climax). However, the overture ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream (Mendelssohn)|A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' (1826) by [[Felix Mendelssohn]] is generally regarded as the first concert overture {{harv|Temperley|2001}}. Mendelssohn's other contributions to this genre include his ''[[Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage (Mendelssohn)|Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage]]'' overture (1828), his overture ''[[The Hebrides (overture)|The Hebrides]]'' (1830; also known as ''Fingal's Cave'') and the overtures ''Die sch\u00f6ne Melusine'' (''The Fair Melusine'', 1834) and ''Ruy Blas'' (1839).  Other notable early concert overtures were written by [[Hector Berlioz]] (e.g., ''[[Les francs-juges|Les Francs juges]]'' (1826), and ''[[Overtures by Hector Berlioz#Le corsaire|Le corsaire]]'' (1828)).\n\n===Later 19th century===\nIn the 1850s the concert overture began to be supplanted by the [[symphonic poem]], a form devised by [[Franz Liszt]] in several works that began as dramatic overtures. The distinction between the two genres was the freedom to mould the musical form according to external [[Program music|programmatic]] requirements {{harv|Temperley|2001}}. The symphonic poem became the preferred form for the more \"progressive\" composers, such as [[C\u00e9sar Franck]],  [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns]], [[Richard Strauss]], [[Alexander Scriabin]], and [[Arnold Schoenberg]], while more conservative composers like [[Anton Rubinstein]], [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], [[Johannes Brahms]], [[Robert Schumann]] and [[Arthur Sullivan]] remained faithful to the overture {{harv|Temperley|2001}}.\n[[File:Pyotr_Ilyich_Tchaikovsky_-_1812_overture.ogg|thumb|right|Tchaikovsky's ''1812 Overture'']]\nIn the age when the symphonic poem had already become popular, Brahms wrote his ''[[Academic Festival Overture]]'', Op. 80, as well as his ''[[Tragic Overture]]'', Op. 81. An example clearly influenced by the symphonic poem is  Tchaikovsky's ''[[1812 Overture]]''. His equally well-known ''[[Romeo and Juliet (Tchaikovsky)|Romeo and Juliet]]'' is also labelled a 'fantasy-overture'.\n\n===20th century===\nIn European music after 1900, an example of an overture displaying a connection with the traditional form is [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]'s ''[[Festive Overture (Shostakovich)|Festive Overture]]'', Op. 96 (1954), which is in two linked sections, \"Allegretto\" and \"Presto\" (Temperely 2001).  [[Malcolm Arnold]]'s ''A Grand, Grand Overture'', Op. 57 (1956), is a 20th-century parody of the late 19th century concert overture, scored for an enormous orchestra with organ, additional [[brass instrument]]s, and [[obbligato]] parts for four [[rifle]]s, three [[The Hoover Company|Hoover]] [[vacuum cleaner]]s (two uprights in B{{music|flat}}, one horizontal with detachable sucker in C), and an electric [[floor polisher]] in E{{music|flat}}; it is dedicated \"to [[Herbert Hoover|President Hoover]]\" ({{harvnb|Anon.|1957}}; {{harvnb|Maycock|2009}}; {{harvnb|Burton-Page|n.d.}}; Anon. 1957 mistakenly says just three rifles, but publisher's website confirms four, as stated also in Maycock 2009).\n\n==Film==\nIn [[motion pictures]], an overture is a piece of music setting the mood for the film before the [[opening credits]] start.

His equally well-known ''[[Romeo and Juliet (Tchaikovsky)|Romeo and Juliet]]'' is also labelled a 'fantasy-overture'.\n\n===20th century===\nIn European music after 1900, an example of an overture displaying a connection with the traditional form is [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]'s ''[[Festive Overture (Shostakovich)|Festive Overture]]'', Op. 96 (1954), which is in two linked sections, \"Allegretto\" and \"Presto\" (Temperely 2001).  [[Malcolm Arnold]]'s ''A Grand, Grand Overture'', Op. 57 (1956), is a 20th-century parody of the late 19th century concert overture, scored for an enormous orchestra with organ, additional [[brass instrument]]s, and [[obbligato]] parts for four [[rifle]]s, three [[The Hoover Company|Hoover]] [[vacuum cleaner]]s (two uprights in B{{music|flat}}, one horizontal with detachable sucker in C), and an electric [[floor polisher]] in E{{music|flat}}; it is dedicated \"to [[Herbert Hoover|President Hoover]]\" ({{harvnb|Anon. 1957}}; {{harvnb|Maycock|2009}}; {{harvnb|Burton-Page|n.d.}}; Anon. 1957 mistakenly says just three rifles, but publisher's website confirms four, as stated also in Maycock 2009).\n\n==Film==\nIn [[motion pictures]], an overture is a piece of music setting the mood for the film before the [[opening credits]] start.
