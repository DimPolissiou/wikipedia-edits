The river ''Slicech'' is also referenced in the Annals of Ulster in 1188.<ref name=Origins/>\n\nThe [[Ordnance Survey]] letters of 1836 state that \"cart loads of shells were found underground in many places within the town where houses now stand\". The whole area, from the river estuary at Sligo, around the coast to the river at [[Ballysadare]] Bay, is rich in marine resources which were utilised as far back as the [[Mesolithic]] period.\n\n===Early history===\nThe importance of Sligo's location in [[prehistory]] is demonstrated by the abundance of ancient sites close by and even within the town. For example, Sligo town's first roundabout was constructed around a megalithic [[passage tomb]] at Abbeyquarter North in Garavogue Villas.<ref name=Bergh>\n{{cite book\n| last             = Bergh\n| first            = Stefan\n| title            = Landscape of the monuments.

The area around Sligo town has one of the highest densities of prehistoric archaeological sites in Ireland. It is the only place in which all classes of Irish megalithic monuments are to be found together. [[Knocknarea]] mountain, capped by the great cairn of [[Miosg\u00e1n M\u00e9dhbh|Miosgan Maeve]], dominates the skyline to the west of the town. Cairns Hill on the southern edge of the town also has two very large stone cairns.\n\nExcavations for the [[National Roads Authority|NRA]] for the N4 Sligo Inner Relief Road in 2002 revealed a [[Bronze Age]] [[Henge]] at Tonafortes (beside the Carraroe roundabout) on the southern outskirts of the town, and an early [[Neolithic]] [[causewayed enclosure]] (c. 4000 B.C.) at Maugheraboy on high ground overlooking the town from the south.

By the 12th century there was a bridge and small settlement in existence at the site of the present town.\n\n===Medieval history===\nThe [[Norman people|Norman]] knight [[Maurice Fitzgerald, Baron of Offaly|Maurice Fitzgerald]], the [[Lord Chief Justice of Ireland]], is generally credited with the establishment of the medieval European-style town and port of Sligo, building [[Sligo Castle]] in [[1245 in Ireland|1245]]. The [[Irish annals|annalists]] refer to the town as a ''sraidbhaile'' ('street settlement') which seems to have consisted of the castle and an attached defensive [[bawn]] in the vicinity of Quay street. A [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] Friary (Blackfriars) was also founded by Maurice Fitzgerald and the King of Connacht [[Felim mac Cathal Crobderg Ua Conchobair]] in 1253. This was accidentally destroyed by fire in 1414, and was subsequently rebuilt in its present form by Tighernan O\u2019Rourke. Norman hegemony was, however, not destined to last long in Sligo. The Norman advance was halted in Sligo after the battle of [[Creadran-Cille|Credran Cille]] in 1257 at Ros Ceite ([[Rosses Point]]) between [[:s:O'Donnell, Godfrey (DNB00)|Godfrey O'Donnell]], Lord of [[Tirconnell]], and Maurice Fitzgerald. Both commanders were mortally wounded in single combat. The Norman invasion of T\u00edr Chonaill was abandoned after this. In 1289 a survey indicates there were 180 [[Burgess (title)|burgesses]] in the town. The Normans had laid a foundation that was to last.\n\nThe town is unique in Ireland in that it is the only Norman-founded Irish town to have been under almost continuous native Irish control throughout the Medieval period. Despite Anglo-Norman attempts to retake it, it became the administrative centre of the O' Conor Sligo ([[\u00d3 Conchobhair Sligigh|O'Conchobar Sligigh]]) confederation of [[\u00cdochtar Connacht|Iochtar Connacht]] (Lower Connacht) by 1315 AD. Also called Clan Aindrias, the O 'Conors were a branch of the O' Conchobar dynasty of [[Kings of Connacht]]. It continued to develop within the [[t\u00faath]] (Irish territory) of [[Cairbre Drom Cliabh]] becoming the effective centre of the confederation of t\u00faatha. The other Irish t\u00faatha subject to here were [[T\u00edr Fh\u00edacrach M\u00faaidhe]], [[Luighne Connacht]], [[Tir Oll\u00edol|Tir Olliol]] and [[Corann]]. Throughout this time Sligo was under the system of [[Early Irish law|F\u00e9nechus]] (Brehon) law and was ruled by the Gaelic system of an elected [[R\u00ed]] t\u00faath (territory king/lord), and an assembly known as an oireacht.\n\nThrough competition between Gaelic dynasties for the lucrative port duties of Sligo, the town was burned, sacked or besieged approximately 49 times during the medieval period, according to the annals of Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://celt.ucc.ie/published/T100005A/ |title=Annals of the Four Masters |publisher=Celt.ucc.ie |date= |accessdate=2019-11-15}}</ref> These raids seem to have had little effect on the development of the town, as by the mid 15th century the town and port had grown in importance. It traded with Galway, [[Bristol]], France and Spain. Amongst the earliest preserved specimens of written English in Connacht is a receipt for 20 marks, dated August 1430, paid by Saunder Lynche and Davy Botyller, to Henry Blake and Walter Blake, customers of \"ye King and John Rede, controller of ye porte of Galvy and of Slego\".\n\nSligo continued under Gaelic control until the late 16th century when, during the Elizabethan conquest, it was selected as the county town for the newly shired County of Sligo. An order was sent by the Elizabethan Government to [[Sir Nicholas Malby]], Knight, wanting him to establish \"apt and safe\" places for the keeping of the Assizes & Sessions, with walls of lime & stone, in each county of Connacht, \"judging that the aptest place be in Sligo, for the County of Sligo\u2026\"<ref name=wood-m>\n{{cite book\n| last            = Wood-Martin\n| first           = W.G.\n| title           = History of Sligo, County and Town.

The [[Annals of Loch C\u00e9|annals]] record the death in 1561 of [[Naisse mac Cithruadh]], the \"most eminent musician that was in \u00c9ireann\", by drowning on [[Lough Gill]].{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn the 17th century, two brothers from County Sligo, [[Thomas Connellan|Thomas]] and [[William Connellan]] from Cloonamahon, were among the last of the great Irish bards and harpists. Thomas is the author of the tune ''Molly MacAlpin'', now known as ''Carolan's Dream'', and William may have written ''Love is a Tormenting Pain'' and ''Killiecrankie''.\n\nSligo traditional musicians were important in the revival and transmission of this tradition when they emigrated to New York.{{fact|date=March 2020}} [[Michael Coleman (Irish musician)|Michael Coleman]], [[James Morrison (fiddler)|James Morrison]] and [[Paddy Killoran]] were all recorded at this time.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Festivals===\nSligo hosts several festivals throughout the year including Sligo Live occurring every October, The Sligo Summer Festival which celebrated the 400th anniversary of Sligo town and the [[Fleadh Cheoil]] which the town hosted in three consecutive years (1989, 1990 & 1991) and again in 2014 and 2015.

These are Sligo All-Stars (located at the Mercy College Gymnasium) and Sligo Giant Warriors (whose venue is the Sligo Grammar Gymnasium).\n\n[[Sligo Racecourse]] at Cleveragh hosts race days at least 8 times per year.\n\n==Government==\n[[File:Sligo Borough Council.jpg|thumb|upright|Sligo Borough Council building]]\nSligo was administered by its own local [[oireachtas]] and the kings of [[Cairbre Drom Cliabh|C\u00e1irbre Drom Cliab]] until the English conquest in the early 17th century. This territory corresponds closely to the newly created Sligo Borough District.\n\nSligo town then became an incorporated municipal borough with a [[Royal charter]] issued by the British [[King James I of England|King James I]] in 1613/14. See [[High Sheriff of Sligo]]. It had the right to elect 12 burgesses to the corporation.\n\nOn 1 June 2014 the old Borough Council was dissolved and administration of the town was amalgamated with the County Council. Sligo is now part of an expanded municipal borough district extending from [[Collooney]] to the border with [[County Leitrim]] at [[Tullaghan]] and containing a population of around 40,000. It elects 10 councillors of 18 in total to Sligo County Council.\n\nSligo has had a mayor since incorporation in 1613. With the re-organisation of local government in 2014 the title has been restyled as Mayor of the Municipal District and is elected by the ten councillors elected for the Sligo Municipal District.\n\n===Law enforcement===\n[[File:SligoCourtHouse.JPG|thumb|upright|Sligo courthouse]]\nFrom its foundation in the 13th century Sligo was administered under local [[Early Irish law|F\u00e9nechus]] (Brehon law) until the establishment of [[Common law|English Common law]] in the early 17th century after the battle of Kinsale. Courts were held regularly throughout the [[tuath]] at various buildings and on hilltops reserved for the purpose. Law enforcement was a function of the nobility and freemen of the area as no police force existed. No records survive from these early courts, but a case is recorded of a Dublin merchant being reimbursed by the local courts after he was fraudulently sold an out of date poem in the 1540s.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eqdnAAAAMAAJ|title=Power, Politics, and Land: Early Modern Sligo, 1568\u20131688|first=Mary|last=O'Dowd|date=2 May 1991|publisher=Institute of Irish Studies, Queen's University of Belfast|accessdate=2 May 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=9780853894049}}</ref> Sligo then came under English martial law and eventually the common law as administered from Dublin and from which descends the present system.\n\nThe modern [[Sligo Courthouse]] was built in 1878.

The two main hospitals are [[Sligo University Hospital]] (formerly General and Regional) and St. John's Hospital. There is also a private hospital at Garden Hill.\n\n==Education==\n{{See also|Education in the Republic of Ireland}}\n\nAs of 2011, 16.9 per cent of adults were educated to at most primary level only; a further 52.0 per cent attained second level while 31.2 per cent were educated to third level. \n\nThere are four main secondary schools in Sligo.

The section of the N4 road between Sligo and Collooney is a dual carriageway. The first phase of this road was completed in January 1998, bypassing the towns of [[Collooney]] and [[Ballysadare]]. An extension to this road was completed in September 2005, and is known as the Sligo Inner Relief Road.\n\nO'Connell Street \u2013 the main street in the town \u2013 was pedestrianised on 15 August 2006.

The harbour can accommodate ships with a maximum draft of 5.2 metres and length of 100 metres, The Port of Sligo extends from the Timber Jetty at Hyde Road Bridge for a distance of 1.3&nbsp;km. Sligo County Council took over responsibility for Sligo Harbour from Sligo Harbour Commissioners in June 2006.\n\nRecords first show the development of Sligo's port as a port of consequence for agricultural goods to Britain and Europe in the 13th century with the arrival of the Normans. As a port under Gaelic lords, much of the fighting about Sligo was for control of the \"[[cocket]]\" of Sligo port. Merchant families set up trade under this system with the O'Creans wine importers being the most well known. They had contacts in France, Spain and Portugal.\n\nOfficial English records in the fifteenth century mention \u2018Fish Quay\u2019 under [[King Henry VI of England|King Henry VI]] reign. Customs duties under the Harbour Commissioners can be traced back to [[King George II of England|George II]]. At that time and for two hundred years thereafter, Sligo was the most important port in the northwest.<ref>Sligo County Council, 2008</ref>{{nonspecific|date=March 2020}}\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries, the port was used for the transit of significant quantities of cattle, hides, butter, barley, oats, and oatmeal being exported and with the city's linen exports well established. Imports included wood, iron, maize and coal. The town prospered due to the trade with wealthy merchants setting up homes along the then fashionable Castle Street and Radcliffe Street (later renamed Grattan Street). This wealth is demonstrated by the Cathedral of John the Baptist, which was completed as early as 1730, to designs by [[Richard Cassels]].\n\nDuring the time of the Great Famine, around 1847\u20131850, it is estimated that more than 30,000 people emigrated through Sligo Port, mainly to Canada and the United States.\n\nThe most notable ship companies to operate out of Sligo included Sligo Steam Navigation Company who introduced the first steamer in 1857, Messrs Middleton & Pollexfen, Harper Cambell Ltd and the former Sligo Harbour Commissioners who owned a number of dredgers used for maintenance of the Channel (McTernan, 1992).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.environ.ie/en/Foreshore/ApplicationsandDeterminations/SligoCountyCouncil/ApplicationsDetails/FileDownLoad,32814,en.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=1 October 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006165015/http://www.environ.ie/en/Foreshore/ApplicationsandDeterminations/SligoCountyCouncil/ApplicationsDetails/FileDownLoad,32814,en.pdf |archivedate=6 October 2014  }}</ref>\n\nThe [[1913 Sligo Dock strike]] lasted for 56 days and was a precursor to the [[Dublin Lockout]] that occurred 6 months later.

The river ''Slicech'' is also referenced in the Annals of Ulster in 1188.<ref name=Origins/>\n\nThe [[Ordnance Survey]] letters of 1836 state that \"cart loads of shells were found underground in many places within the town where houses now stand\". The whole area, from the river estuary at Sligo, around the coast to the river at [[Ballysadare]] Bay, is rich in marine resources which were utilised as far back as the [[Mesolithic]] period.\n\n===Early history===\nThe importance of Sligo's location in [[prehistory]] is demonstrated by the abundance of ancient sites close by and even within the town. For example, Sligo town's first roundabout was constructed around a megalithic [[passage tomb]] at Abbeyquarter North in Garavogue Villas.<ref name=Bergh>\n{{cite book\n| last             = Bergh\n| first            = Stefan\n| title            = Landscape of the monuments.

The area around Sligo town has one of the highest densities of prehistoric archaeological sites in Ireland. It is the only place in which all classes of Irish megalithic monuments are to be found together. [[Knocknarea]] mountain, capped by the great cairn of [[Miosg\u00e1n M\u00e9dhbh|Miosgan Maeve]], dominates the skyline to the west of the town. Cairns Hill on the southern edge of the town also has two very large stone cairns.\n\nExcavations for the [[National Roads Authority|NRA]] for the N4 Sligo Inner Relief Road in 2002 revealed a [[Bronze Age]] [[Henge]] at Tonafortes (beside the Carraroe roundabout) on the southern outskirts of the town, and an early [[Neolithic]] [[causewayed enclosure]] (c. 4000 B.C.) at Maugheraboy on high ground overlooking the town from the south.

By the 12th century there was a bridge and small settlement in existence at the site of the present town.\n\n===Medieval history===\nThe [[Norman people|Norman]] knight [[Maurice Fitzgerald, Baron of Offaly|Maurice Fitzgerald]], the [[Lord Chief Justice of Ireland]], is generally credited with the establishment of the medieval European-style town and port of Sligo, building [[Sligo Castle]] in [[1245 in Ireland|1245]]. The [[Irish annals|annalists]] refer to the town as a ''sraidbhaile'' ('street settlement') which seems to have consisted of the castle and an attached defensive [[bawn]] in the vicinity of Quay street. A [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] Friary (Blackfriars) was also founded by Maurice Fitzgerald and the King of Connacht [[Felim mac Cathal Crobderg Ua Conchobair]] in 1253. This was accidentally destroyed by fire in 1414, and was subsequently rebuilt in its present form by Tighernan O\u2019Rourke. Norman hegemony was, however, not destined to last long in Sligo. The Norman advance was halted in Sligo after the battle of [[Creadran-Cille|Credran Cille]] in 1257 at Ros Ceite ([[Rosses Point]]) between [[:s:O'Donnell, Godfrey (DNB00)|Godfrey O'Donnell]], Lord of [[Tirconnell]], and Maurice Fitzgerald. Both commanders were mortally wounded in single combat. The Norman invasion of T\u00edr Chonaill was abandoned after this. In 1289 a survey indicates there were 180 [[Burgess (title)|burgesses]] in the town. The Normans had laid a foundation that was to last.\n\nThe town is unique in Ireland in that it is the only Norman-founded Irish town to have been under almost continuous native Irish control throughout the Medieval period. Despite Anglo-Norman attempts to retake it, it became the administrative centre of the O' Conor Sligo ([[\u00d3 Conchobhair Sligigh|O'Conchobar Sligigh]]) confederation of [[\u00cdochtar Connacht|Iochtar Connacht]] (Lower Connacht) by 1315 AD. Also called Clan Aindrias, the O 'Conors were a branch of the O' Conchobar dynasty of [[Kings of Connacht]]. It continued to develop within the [[t\u00faath]] (Irish territory) of [[Cairbre Drom Cliabh]] becoming the effective centre of the confederation of t\u00faatha. The other Irish t\u00faatha subject to here were [[T\u00edr Fh\u00edacrach M\u00faaidhe]], [[Luighne Connacht]], [[Tir Oll\u00edol|Tir Olliol]] and [[Corann]]. Throughout this time Sligo was under the system of [[Early Irish law|F\u00e9nechus]] (Brehon) law and was ruled by the Gaelic system of an elected [[R\u00ed]] t\u00faath (territory king/lord), and an assembly known as an oireacht.\n\nThrough competition between Gaelic dynasties for the lucrative port duties of Sligo, the town was burned, sacked or besieged approximately 49 times during the medieval period, according to the annals of Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://celt.ucc.ie/published/T100005A/ |title=Annals of the Four Masters |publisher=Celt.ucc.ie |date= |accessdate=2019-11-15}}</ref> These raids seem to have had little effect on the development of the town, as by the mid 15th century the town and port had grown in importance. It traded with Galway, [[Bristol]], France and Spain. Amongst the earliest preserved specimens of written English in Connacht is a receipt for 20 marks, dated August 1430, paid by Saunder Lynche and Davy Botyller, to Henry Blake and Walter Blake, customers of \"ye King and John Rede, controller of ye porte of Galvy and of Slego\".\n\nSligo continued under Gaelic control until the late 16th century when, during the Elizabethan conquest, it was selected as the county town for the newly shired County of Sligo. An order was sent by the Elizabethan Government to [[Sir Nicholas Malby]], Knight, wanting him to establish \"apt and safe\" places for the keeping of the Assizes & Sessions, with walls of lime & stone, in each county of Connacht, \"judging that the aptest place be in Sligo, for the County of Sligo\u2026\"<ref name=wood-m>\n{{cite book\n| last            = Wood-Martin\n| first           = W.G.\n| title           = History of Sligo, County and Town.

Much of the structure, including the choir, carved altar (the only one in situ in Ireland) and cloisters remains. When [[Frederick Hamilton (soldier)|Sir Frederick Hamilton's]] Parliamentarian soldiers partially sacked Sligo in 1642, the Friary was burned and many friars killed.\n\nDuring the [[Williamite War]] (1689\u201391) the town was fought over between the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] [[Irish Army (Kingdom of Ireland)|Irish Army]] loyal to [[James II of Ireland|James II]] and [[Williamite]] forces.

Both ended in victory for the workers.\n\nSligo town was heavily garrisoned by the [[British Army]] during the War of Independence. For this reason IRA activity was limited to actions such as harassment, sabotage and jailbreaks. At various times during the war prominent Republicans were held at the [[Sligo Gaol]]. The commander of IRA forces in Sligo was [[Liam Pilkington]].\n\nArthur Griffith spoke in April 1922 on the corner of O' Connell St. and Grattan St. To this day it is known as Griffiths corner.\nDuring the Civil war, Sligo railway station was blown up by Anti-Treaty forces on 10 January 1923.\n\nIn 1961 [[St John the Baptist Cathedral, Sligo|St. John the Baptist's Church]] became a cathedral of the [[Diocese of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh]] after St. Mary's Cathedral in Elphin was abandoned, being destroyed by a storm four years previously.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:North Sligo Town.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Sligo]]\nSituated on a coastal plain facing the Atlantic Ocean, Sligo is located on low gravel hills on the banks of the [[Garavogue River]] between [[Lough Gill]] and the estuary of the Garavogue river leading to [[Sligo Bay]]. The town is surrounded on three sides by an arc of mountains, with the Ox Mountain ridges of Slieve Daeane and Killery Mountain to the southeast bordering Lough Gill. The flat topped limestone plateaux of Cope's, Keelogyboy and Castlegal Mountains to the north and northeast and the singular hill of [[Knocknarea]] with its Neolithic cairn to the west and the distinctive high plateau of [[Benbulben]] to the north.\n\nSligo is an important bridging point on the main north/south route between [[Ulster]] and [[Connacht]]. It is the county town of [[County Sligo]] and is in the Barony of [[Carbury, County Sligo|Carbury]] (formerly the Gaelic [[tuath]] of [[Cairbre Drom Cliabh]]). Sligo is the diocesan seat of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Elphin]]. It is in the Church of Ireland [[Diocese of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh]].\n\nCounty Sligo is one of the counties of the province of [[Connacht]]. It is part of the [[Border Region]], a region of over 500,000 people which also comprises the counties of [[County Cavan|Cavan]], [[County Donegal|Donegal]], [[County Leitrim|Leitrim]], [[County Louth|Louth]] and [[County Monaghan|Monaghan]].<ref name=WDC>\n{{cite web\n| url              = http://www.wdc.ie/countyprofiles_sligo.html\n| title            = County Profiles \u2013 Sligo\n| accessdate       = 13 May 2008\n| work             = Western Development Commission\n|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071118174420/http://www.wdc.ie/countyprofiles_sligo.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 18 November 2007}}\n</ref>\n\n===Architecture===\nThe town consists of a medieval core with mainly 19th century buildings many of which are of architectural merit.<ref name=\"amazonaws1\">{{cite web|url=https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/assets.ria.ie/ihta/ihta-digital/anglo-norman-towns/sligo/IHTA_24_Sligo_Text.pdf|title=Topographical information.

The harbour can accommodate ships with a maximum draft of 5.2 metres and length of 100 metres, The Port of Sligo extends from the Timber Jetty at Hyde Road Bridge for a distance of 1.3&nbsp;km. Sligo County Council took over responsibility for Sligo Harbour from Sligo Harbour Commissioners in June 2006.\n\nRecords first show the development of Sligo's port as a port of consequence for agricultural goods to Britain and Europe in the 13th century with the arrival of the Normans. As a port under Gaelic lords, much of the fighting about Sligo was for control of the \"[[cocket]]\" of Sligo port. Merchant families set up trade under this system with the O'Creans wine importers being the most well known. They had contacts in France, Spain and Portugal.\n\nOfficial English records in the fifteenth century mention \u2018Fish Quay\u2019 under [[King Henry VI of England|King Henry VI]] reign. Customs duties under the Harbour Commissioners can be traced back to [[King George II of England|George II]]. At that time and for two hundred years thereafter, Sligo was the most important port in the northwest.<ref>Sligo County Council, 2008</ref>{{nonspecific|date=March 2020}}\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries, the port was used for the transit of significant quantities of cattle, hides, butter, barley, oats, and oatmeal being exported and with the city's linen exports well established. Imports included wood, iron, maize and coal. The town prospered due to the trade with wealthy merchants setting up homes along the then fashionable Castle Street and Radcliffe Street (later renamed Grattan Street). This wealth is demonstrated by the Cathedral of John the Baptist, which was completed as early as 1730, to designs by [[Richard Cassels]].\n\nDuring the time of the Great Famine, around 1847\u20131850, it is estimated that more than 30,000 people emigrated through Sligo Port, mainly to Canada and the United States.\n\nThe most notable ship companies to operate out of Sligo included Sligo Steam Navigation Company who introduced the first steamer in 1857, Messrs Middleton & Pollexfen, Harper Cambell Ltd and the former Sligo Harbour Commissioners who owned a number of dredgers used for maintenance of the Channel (McTernan, 1992).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.environ.ie/en/Foreshore/ApplicationsandDeterminations/SligoCountyCouncil/ApplicationsDetails/FileDownLoad,32814,en.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=1 October 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006165015/http://www.environ.ie/en/Foreshore/ApplicationsandDeterminations/SligoCountyCouncil/ApplicationsDetails/FileDownLoad,32814,en.pdf |archivedate=6 October 2014  }}</ref>\n\nThe [[1913 Sligo Dock strike]] lasted for 56 days and was a precursor to the [[Dublin Lockout]] that occurred 6 months later. Unlike the Dublin Lockout, the Sligo Dock strike resulted in victory to the workers.\n\nThe port of Sligo declined during the 20th century with the change from sail to steamships.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://catalogue.nli.ie/Search/Results?lookfor=sligo+quays&type=AllFields&filter%255B%255D=format%253A%22Photo%22&filter%255B%255D=digitised%253A%22Digitised%22\n| title = Search Results \u2013 sligo quays\n| website = catalogue.nli.ie\n| access-date = 29 February 2016\n}}</ref>{{Better source|reason=The URL gives a set of NLI search results \u2013 unclear how this supports the prior text|date=February 2016}} In modern times, the port handles cargoes of coal, timber, fish meal and scrap metal and around 25 ships per year dock in the harbour.{{cn|date=February 2020}} In 2012 a feasibility study was undertaken into the dredging of the shipping channel.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Media==\nThere are three local newspapers in Sligo: The ''[[Sligo Weekender]]'' \u2013 out every Thursday (formerly Tuesday), The Free ''Northwest Express''  \u2013 out the first Thursday of each month and ''[[The Sligo Champion]]'' \u2013 out every Tuesday (formerly Wednesday).

Meanwhile, three students, Erwin, Louise and Iina, shared a bond over being in the lower class and the youngest children of their families. Wanting to gain Wendelin's recognition, the three attempt to hunt large pack of wolves but are overwhelmed by their numbers until Wendelin rescues them. Due to a misunderstanding, the three believes Wendelin sees them as a burden when in reality he wants to be friends with them.

When the Duke asks for a private meeting with Wendelin, he asks Erwin, Louise and Iina to join him much to their surprise. Wendelin and the others learn Braihiraider brought them to meet his court wizard, Brantack Lyngstad, Alfred's former teacher, who confirms his suspicions that Alfred passed on his knowledge to Wendelin before his passing. Realising that Wendelin is not so different to them, Erwin, Louise and Iina agree to be Wendelin's friends and join his party.

His mother died when he was very young, so his grandma had to take care of him. He was very poor as a child, so he had to work as newspaper mailman and many other jobs in order to survive.\n\n==Club career==\nHiguita started his playing career with [[Millonarios F.C.|Millonarios]] and transferred to [[Atl\u00e9tico Nacional]] in 1986. He played the majority of his club career with the Colombian side where he helped the team win the [[Categor\u00eda Primera A|Colombian League]] on numerous occasions as well as the [[Copa Libertadores]] and [[Copa Interamericana]], both in 1989. After leaving them, he moved to Spain to play with [[Real Valladolid]] for one season, before coming back to Atletico Nacional for four years. He then left to Mexico to play for [[Tiburones Rojos de Veracruz|Veracruz]] before coming back to the Colombian league to play for Atletico's city rivals, [[Independiente Medell\u00edn]].\n\nHe briefly retired in 2005 after failing a drug test while playing for [[Aucas Quito|Aucas]].\n\nHe came out of retirement on 21 July 2007 to sign for Venezuelan club [[Guaros F\u00fatbol Club|Guaros FC]]. In January 2008, aged 41, he signed for the Colombian second division team [[Leones F.C.|Deportivo Rionegro]]. In June 2008 he signed for another Colombia team, [[Deportivo Pereira]], and finally retired on 25 January 2010.<ref>{{cite web|author=Tim Vickery |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/timvickery/2010/02/the_legacy_of_rene_higuita.html |title=The legacy of Rene Higuita |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=30 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n==International career==\n[[File:Higuita pateando.jpg|thumb|150px|Higuita in the training sessions with Colombia during the 1990 World Cup]]\nHiguita's first major tournament was the [[1989 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], where the team was knocked out in the first round. In the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]], he played an important part to lead the country into the round of 16 for the first time ever. However, Higuita's unorthodox playing style caused a mistake by him that knocked Colombia out of the World Cup, when he tried to feint [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] striker [[Roger Milla]] but failed, and Milla dispossessed him and scored, which put Cameroon through to the quarter-finals.

He received $64,000 for his services, which breaks Colombian law as it is an offence to profit from a kidnapping. He was incarcerated for seven months before being released without charge.

His mother died when he was very young, so his grandma had to take care of him. He was very poor as a child, so he had to work as newspaper mailman and many other jobs in order to survive.\n\n==Club career==\nHiguita started his playing career with [[Millonarios F.C.|Millonarios]] and transferred to [[Atl\u00e9tico Nacional]] in 1986. He played the majority of his club career with the Colombian side where he helped the team win the [[Categor\u00eda Primera A|Colombian League]] on numerous occasions as well as the [[Copa Libertadores]] and [[Copa Interamericana]], both in 1989. After leaving them, he moved to Spain to play with [[Real Valladolid]] for one season, before coming back to Atletico Nacional for four years. He then left to Mexico to play for [[Tiburones Rojos de Veracruz|Veracruz]] before coming back to the Colombian league to play for Atletico's city rivals, [[Independiente Medell\u00edn]].\n\nHe briefly retired in 2005 after failing a drug test while playing for [[Aucas Quito|Aucas]].\n\nHe came out of retirement on 21 July 2007 to sign for Venezuelan club [[Guaros F\u00fatbol Club|Guaros FC]]. In January 2008, aged 41, he signed for the Colombian second division team [[Leones F.C.|Deportivo Rionegro]]. In June 2008 he signed for another Colombia team, [[Deportivo Pereira]], and finally retired on 25 January 2010.<ref>{{cite web|author=Tim Vickery |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/timvickery/2010/02/the_legacy_of_rene_higuita.html |title=The legacy of Rene Higuita |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=30 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n==International career==\n[[File:Higuita pateando.jpg|thumb|150px|Higuita in the training sessions with Colombia during the 1990 World Cup]]\nHiguita's first major tournament was the [[1989 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], where the team was knocked out in the first round. In the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]], he played an important part to lead the country into the round of 16 for the first time ever. However, Higuita's unorthodox playing style caused a mistake by him that knocked Colombia out of the World Cup, when he tried to feint [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] striker [[Roger Milla]] but failed, and Milla dispossessed him and scored, which put Cameroon through to the quarter-finals.

Pourbus''' (c. 1523, in [[Gouda, South Holland|Gouda]] \u2013 30 January 1584, in [[Bruges]]) was a [[Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting|Flemish Renaissance painter]], draftsman, engineer and cartographer who was active in Bruges during the 16th century.  He is known primarily for his religious and portrait painting.<ref name=RKD>.[https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists/64551 Pieter Pourbus] at the [[Netherlands Institute for Art History]] {{in lang|nl}}</ref>\n[[File:The Annunciation, by Pieter Pourbus.jpg|thumb|450px|''The Annunciation'',1552, Museum Gouda, Netherlands, oil on panel, 117 x 112 cm, signed c.: 1552 / PETRVS POVRBUS ME FECIT]]\n\n== Life ==\n=== Birth and origin ===\nPieter Pourbus was born in Gouda in 1523 or 1524.  He moved to Bruges at the age of 20.<br>\n\nVery little is known on his childhood and youth, at the time when he lived in Gouda. <br>\nAll sources only make a brief mention of his origins.<br>\n\n===== Gouda =====\nHis first biography was written by contemporary artist biographer [[Karel_van_Mander|Karel van Mander]] in his renowned \"Painting Book\" (\"Schilder-boeck\") of 1604<ref>Marc De Beyer & Josephina De Fauw, ''\"Pieter Pourbus, Master painter of Gouda\"'', 2018. Catalogue of the exhibition Feb.17 - June 17 2108 at Museum Gouda. 86 pages. Article written by Paul H.A.M. Abels, \u00a7.1, page 31</ref>.<br>\n\"Even so, I would not like to conceal any of the most special. That is why I wish to present this view of\nPieter Pourbus\". <br>\n\"Born in the Dutch town of Gouda, he based himself in Bruges from an early age\".<ref>Van Mander 1604, fol. 257r; original text in Dutch:''\u2018\u2026Evenwel soud\u2019 ick niet geern eenige der besonderste verzwijgen. Daerom ick hier wil voor ooghen stellen Pieter Pourbus.\u2019''</ref> <br>\nWith these words, [[Karel_van_Mander|Karel van Mander]], the author of the 1604 work \"Het Schilder-Boeck, over t\u2019 leven der Vermaerde Doorluchtighe Schilders\" (\"The Book of Painters, about the life of Renowned Honourable Painters\") describes his colleague from Bruges.<br>\nKarel remembers him as \"the painter of Bruges\".<br>\nThe two met in 1580, when [[Karel_van_Mander|Van Mander]] fled the ravages of the Eighty Years\u2019 War and stayed in Bruges for a time. <br>\nPourbus must have overwhelmed him with information about all of the beautiful sights of Bruges at that time, as he was the source for most of the information [[Karel_van_Mander|Van Mander]] provides regarding the Bruges school of painting.<ref>Article written by Paul Huvenne, \u00a7.1 page 9, in Marc De Beyer & Josephina De Fauw, ''\"Pieter Pourbus, Master painter of Gouda\"'', 2018. Catalogue of the exhibition Feb.17 - June 17 2108 at Museum Gouda. 86 pages</ref><br>\n\nWe do not have any portrait or self portrait of Pieter Pourbus, but he probably included his own portrait on the left altar wing of the \"Tryptych of the Holy Sacrament fraternity\" in the St Saviour's Cathedral, Bruges.<br>\n\nAt the time, Pourbus was not considered a native in Bruges itself.\nWhen he registers as a master painter with the guild of Sculptors and Saddlers in 1543 as \"Pieter Jansyns Poerbus\", he is explicitly marked \"as a stranger\" (\u2018vrymde\u2019) in the records. He must have been 19 or 20 years old at the time, based on the mentions of his age in a range of documents. From there, we can conclude that he must have been born in 1523 or 1524. <br>\n\nAt the occasion of the exhibition on Pieter Pourbus at the Gouda Museum in 2018, Paul Abels wrote in the catalogue of this exhibition on the role Gouda played in his life by putting what little is known about his ties to the city in the context of late-medieval religious and social life In Gouda.<ref>Article written by Paul H.A.M. Abels, \u00a7.1, page 31, in Marc De Beyer & Josephina De Fauw, ''\"Pieter Pourbus, Master painter of Gouda\"'', 2018. Catalogue of the exhibition Feb.17 - June 17 2108 at Museum Gouda. 86 pages</ref>\n\nHe mentioned that the name Pourbus features several times in Gouda at the start of the sixteenth century. <br>\nBut he adds that only one person in the Gouda city archives who would actually qualify as Pourbus\u2019 father, namely \"Jan Pieterssoen Puerboss\", who features in the city accounts in 1529. The accounts mention a payment made to him for \"painting the board that stands in front of the window\". The mention is brief, but it allows to corroborate [[Karel_van_Mander|Van Mander\u2019s]] claim about Pourbus\u2019 Gouda roots by another contemporary source. <br>\nThis source also shows that he was also a painter, although it is not possible to know what his real artistic skills were. The mention most likely refers to painting a (town\u2019s) coat of arms on a shutter.<ref>Paul H.A.M. Abels, \u00a7. page 31, in Marc De Beyer & Josephina De Fauw, ''Pieter Pourbus, Master painter of Gouda'', 2018. Catalogue of the exhibition Feb.17 - June 17 2108 at Museum Gouda. 86 pages</ref>\n\n===== From Gouda to Bruges =====\nPourbus\u2019 move to Bruges can be explained because Bruges is known to be a city that produces excellent painting, although that reputation is waning slightly when Pourbus arrives.<br>\nBruges is familiar territory for the Gouda residents. Pourbus will have heard many stories about the city of Bruges when growing up. The two cities are closely connected by the beer trade, which was the leading line of business in Gouda at the time.<br>\n\nBefore he went to Bruges, he may have studied his craft with Utrecht-based painters such as [[Jan_van_Scorel|Jan van Scorel]] or the Leiden masters. Recent technical research suggests Leiden, more so than Utrecht.<br>\n[[Lucas_van_Leyden|Lucas van Leyden]] and [[Cornelis_Engebrechtsz.|Cornelis Engelbrechtsz]] pass away when Pourbus is still a child, but he may have come into contact with Engelbrechtsz\u2019s three sons, [[Cornelis Cornelisz Kunst|Cornelis]], [[Lucas Cornelisz de Kock|Lucas]], and [[Pieter Cornelisz. Kunst]], who followed in their father\u2019s footsteps and became painters in their own right.<br>\n\n=== Pourbus in Bruges ===\nShortly after he registers with the \u2019Sculptors and Saddlers\u2019 Guild in Bruges in 1543 ( the Bruges \"[[Guild_of_Saint_Luke|Guild of Saint Luke]]\"), Pieter Pourbus marries. He weds Anna, the youngest daughter of painter [[Lancelot_Blondeel|Lancelot Blondeel]]. His marriage to the daughter of an established artist lacking any male heirs is very important for his reputation and further career as a master painter.<ref>from the article written by Paul H.A.M. Abels, \u00a7. page 34, in: Marc De Beyer & Josephina De Fauw, ''\"Pieter Pourbus, Master painter of Gouda\"'', 2018. Catalogue of the exhibition Feb.17 - June 17 2108 at Museum Gouda. 86 pages</ref> <br>\nIn 1545 or 1546, she bears him a son, Frans ([[Frans_Pourbus_the_Elder|\u2018the elder\u2019]]), who is predestined to take up his father\u2019s brush after him. Pourbus integrates into the city of Bruges with ease. <br>\nHe becomes a member of the crossbowmen\u2019s guild of St George and often visits the rhetorician meetings organised by the Chamber of the Holy Spirit. [[Lancelot_Blondeel|Blondeel]], who is a well-respected person there, may have introduced him.<br>\nIt is unclear where Pourbus\u2019 initial training as a painter took place. Recent research into his underdrawings\npoints in the direction of Leiden.6 Very few concrete details of his first few years in Bruges are known. It would appear that he initially operated from under the wing of his successful father-in-law.<ref>Paul Huvenne, in Catalogue of the exhibition Feb.17 - June 17 2108 at Museum Gouda: Marc De Beyer & Josephina De Fauw, ''\"Pieter Pourbus, Master painter of Gouda\"'', 2018.  86 pages. \u00a7.1 page 11</ref>\n===== Working in Blondeel's studio =====\n[[Lancelot_Blondeel|Blondeel]], perhaps the most authoritative artist of his generation in Bruges, introduced an early form of Italian renaissance painting.<br>\n[[File:Pieter Pourbus - Last Supper - WGA18255.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Pieter Pourbus - ''The last Supper'', 1548 - 46,5x63cm - [[Groeningemuseum]], Bruges]]\nPourbus\u2019 earliest work is in line with this school of painting. \nIn fact, it remains unclear in some cases whether the works are the result of collaboration or whether they were painted by him individually, for instance in the case of ''\"The Seven Joys of the Virgin\"'', which hangs in the Tournai Cathedral, for which these two artists join forces.<br>\n\nPourbus\u2019 smaller work ''\"Last Supper\"''<ref>Pourbus made later five other depictions of the Last Supper (all of imposing size) in addition to the present painting, including the 1559 Triptych of the Brotherhood of the Sacrament (Saint James Church, Bruges) and that of 1562 in the Onze Lieve Vrouwekerk, Bruges. <br>\nThe former still retains its original double-sided wings, the left one showing Melchisedech\u2019s Offering and the right one, Elijah Fed by the Angel, </ref> indicates that his father-in-law also introduced him to the ''\u2018Rederijker\u2019'' or rhetorician circles of amateur poets and reciting artists.<br>\n\nThis little painting depicts the Last Supper as described in the Refrains of rhetorician [https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduard_de_Dene Edward van Dene].<br>\n\nNote on this small painting a rare iconography for this subject, with the presence of a devil entering the room on the right of the painting.\n\n[[File:Pierre pourbus-triptico de los santos juanes-prado.jpg|thumb|center|750px|Pieter Pourbus - Triptych of '' \"Baptism of Christ\" '', 1549, 241x377cm - [[Prado Museum]], Madrid]]<br>\n\nIt is unclear exactly when Pourbus began working for himself. <br>\nFor example, he began painting for the Spanish art market at an early stage. <br>\nHis monumental triptych ''\"The Baptism of Christ\"'', which dates back to 1549 and now hangs in the Museo del Prado in Madrid, indicates how grand these commissions can be.<br>\n\nOne of his works was recently unearthed, the Spanish epitaph of Martin Cruzat, which dates back to 1548. <br>\nThis is a classic Piet\u00e0 featuring the deceased\u2019s portrait, evidently intended for the grave in his parish church in Pamplona. <br>\nThe piece was on display for the public for the first time at the exhibition of the Museum Gouda in 2018.<br>\n\nAnother work that dates back to Pourbus\u2019 early years in Bruges is his only remaining non-religious history work, ''\"An Allegory of True Love\"'', currently part of the Wallace Collection in London. <br>\n[[File:Pieter Pourbus - Allegory of true love.jpg|thumb|550px|center| Pieter Pourbus - ''Allegory of true love'', c. 1547 - 132,8x205,7cm - Wallace collection, London]]This painting shows Pourbus\u2019s painting style as truly innovative.<ref>Paul Huvenne, in Catalogue of the exhibition Feb.17 - June 17 2108 at Museum Gouda: Marc De Beyer & Josephina De Fauw, ''Pieter Pourbus, Master painter of Gouda'', 2018. 86 pages. \u00a7.2 page 11</ref><br>\n\n===== Out of Blondeel's shadow =====\n[[File:Pieter Pourbus Portret1.jpg|thumb|200px|Pieter Pourbus ''Portrait of Jan van Eyewerve'', 1551 - [[Groeningemuseum]], Bruges]] [[File:Pieter Pourbus Portret2.jpg|thumb|200px|Pieter Pourbus ''Portrait of Jacquemyne Buuck'', 1551, [[Groeningemuseum]], Bruges]]As from 1549, Pourbus leaves his father-in-law\u2019s shadow. From this moment on, his name starts appearing in all sorts of historical documents with great frequency. <br>\nHe is named yearly, and sometimes even daily, in many official sources. <br>\nSome notable commissions will also have played a role in increasing his fame, such as the decorations for the Joyous entry of Charles V and prince Philip II in 1549 (\u2018Blijde intocht van Karel V en prins Filips in 1549\u2019), a design for a new banquet hall, and a ''\"Last Judgment\"'' (''\u2018Laatste Oordeel\u2019''); all of these are commissions for the so-called ''\u2018Brugse Vrije\u2019'' (also known as the Liberty of Bruges), the legally autonomous territory of Bruges.<br>\n\nAnother prominent commission was his works for the mausoleum of Margaret of Austria at the Annunciation Convent in Bruges, which the magnificent Annunciation currently displayed at Museum Gouda was part of.\nPourbus gradually became the preferred master painter of the bourgeoisie, such as wine merchant Jan van Eyewerve and his wife Jacquemyne Buuck. They had their portraits painted to celebrate their wedding. <br>\n\nThe fact that Pourbus expressly dates and signs his works throughout this period is indicative of the rise in his confidence.<br>\n\n\nPourbus also made many topographic maps. <br>\nHe began using a new methodology based on triangulation that resulted in very modern-looking maps.13 It was a new format for visual reports intended to support surveyors\u2019 legal reports. <br>\nIt is unknown how Pourbus obtained this knowledge, but his 1549 map of the canal between Damme and Sluis indicates that he was most likely already using the new technique at that time, constituting a grand innovative move in 1540s Bruges.<br>\nAll of this hard work paid off: in 1552, Pourbus bought Huis Rome (\u2018the Rome House\u2019) on the Heer Jan Admiraelstraat. [[Karel_van_Mander|Van Mander]] later writes that here, Pourbus set up the best painting studio he ever saw.<ref>Paul Huvenne, in Catalogue of the exhibition Feb.17 - June 17 2108 at Museum Gouda: Marc De Beyer & Josephina De Fauw, ''Pieter Pourbus, Master painter of Gouda'', 2018. 86 pages. \u00a7.2 page 13</ref>\n\n===== Active Guild member =====\nAs from 1551, Pourbus became a prominent and active member of his guild\u2019s council; he served two terms as dean of the guild and five terms as sworn elder. He was very committed to his guild duties; for example, as an elder, he participated in quality checks on fellow guild members. He visited Simon Puseel in response to the latter\u2019s poor performance in gilding the dome of the Jerusalem Chapel in Bruges. As a dean, he acted to prevent paintings from Dordrecht being sold inside the city walls. He also defended the guild\u2019s interests several times in the leasing of land it owned in the province of Zeeland. Clearly, Pourbus was a very active and committed member of the Bruges Guild of Sculptors and Saddlers.<ref>Paul Huvenne, in Catalogue of the exhibition Feb.17 - June 17 2108 at Museum Gouda: Marc De Beyer & Josephina De Fauw, ''Pieter Pourbus, Master painter of Gouda'', 2018. 86 pages. \u00a7.2 page 16</ref>\n\n=== Pourbus\u2019 best years ===\nThe decade following his breakthrough in 1550 boasts the best work of his career.<br>\n\n===== Pourbus truly surpasses himself as a portraitist =====\nPourbus\u2019 fine portrait of Joris (?) van den Heede, whose family motto \"sint sine dentes sales\" (\"be witty without spite\") was taken word for word from Erasmus\u2019 introduction to \"In Praise of Folly\", is reminiscent of that of Jan van Eyewerve.\n\nAnd with his portraits of \"Pieter Dominicle and his wife Livina van der Beke\", Pourbus truly surpasses himself as a portraitist.<br>\n[[File:Pieter Pourbus . Portrait of a young lady.1554.signed and dated.jpg|thumb|275px|Pieter Pourbus.''Portrait of a noble young lady''.signed and dated 1554.<br>\nPrivate collection]]\nThe captivating elegance with which he portrays women is even more evident in this smaller \"Portrait of a noble young lady\", from a private collection.<br>\nUnfortunately, no inscription or family crest is to be seen on the painting, neither could it be found after IR or X rays examination. It is therefore impossible to identify the lady depicted, but her rich dress, distinguished appearance, and self-aware gaze shows that this is a lady of considerable standing.<br>\nHer dress, with its delicate lace collar, allowed [http://vlaamseprimitieven.vlaamsekunstcollectie.be/en/research/researchers/paul-huvenne Paul Huvenne]<ref>https://www.codart.nl/museums/kmska-director-paul-huvenne-to-retire-on-1-august/</ref>, who discovered this painting, to date the portrait as having been painted before 1560.<br>\nAnd indeed the IR examination revealed Pourbus' monogram, as well as the year when he painted this captivating portrait: 1554.<br>\nAs [http://vlaamseprimitieven.vlaamsekunstcollectie.be/en/research/researchers/paul-huvenne Paul Huvenne]<ref>https://www.codart.nl/museums/kmska-director-paul-huvenne-to-retire-on-1-august/</ref> writes it, it is one of the finest example of Pourbus\u2019 portrait style, and probably the masterwork among its intimate portraits:<br>\n\"He manages to lift the striking likeness that is expected of any portrait to an icon that radiates societal and spiritual values. In doing so, he endows the person depicted with a detached, but animated beauty that leaves no one unmoved\"<ref>Paul Huvenne, in Catalogue of the exhibition Feb.17 - June 17 2108 at Museum Gouda: Marc De Beyer & Josephina De Fauw, ''Pieter Pourbus, Master painter of Gouda'', 2018. 86 pages. \u00a7.3 page 16 and 17</ref>.<br>\nIn an article published at the occasion of the exhibition at the Gouda Museum, another author describes this portrait as [https://marccouwenbergh.nl/de-mona-lisa-van-pieter-pourbus-meester-schilder-uit-gouda/ '''the Mona Lisa of Pourbus\"'']. <br>\nMoreover, in a detailed following article<ref>https://marccouwenbergh.nl/anna-van-bueren-versus-de-mona-lisa-van-pieter-pourbus-meester-schilder-uit-gouda/</ref>, he draws attention on many similarities between this portrait and the portrait of [[Anna van Egmont]], first wife of [[William the Silent|William of Orange]], belonging to the Royal collection, The Hague. The comparison can also be found [[Anna_van_Egmont#A_newly_discovered_portrait_of_Anna_van_Egmont?|here]].<br>\n\nHis art as a portraitist is also revealed during this decade by group portraits that are second to none. <br>\nThe wing-panels with portraits of the Members of the Noble Confraternity of the Holy Blood and the Sacra Confrerie of St Salvators is a wonderful example. <br>\nThe position of the sitters suggest that Pourbus must have envisioned the work of Utrecht-based painter [[Jan_van_Scorel|Jan van Scorel]].<br>\n\n===== History painter  =====\nPourbus is now also able to prove himself as a history painter.<br>\n\nHe follows up on his impressive Last Judgment, now part of the Groeningemuseum\u2019s collection, and the beautiful Annunciation in Museum Gouda with the smaller Crucifixion in 1557.<br>\n[[File:Pourbus-Vanbelle-Triptiek.jpg|thumb|left|500px|Pourbus - ''\"Van Belle Triptych\"'',1556 - St James' church, Bruges]]\nBut more than any other work, the Van Belle triptych illustrates how Pourbus\u2019 style has matured.<br>\nIn many ways, this triptych is a key piece in his oeuvre, not only because it is one of his best paintings, but also because it is so well documented in archival materials.\nFor example, one of the items that survived is the original design drawing that Pourbus presented to Joos Van Belle for his approval.<br>\nThe sheet bears handwritten comments, in which the artist agrees to portray the Madonna not with clenched hands but in a more resigned posture: ''\u2018with the arms pressed crosswise over one another\u2019''. The theme of Our Lady of the Seven Sorrows on the middle panel was a very popular one in Pourbus\u2019 day, and it will have been quite a challenge for the artist to come up with a new, convincing composition to depict the theme.\nPourbus\u2019 depiction of the Virgin Mary owes much to the statue of the Madonna with Child by Michelangelo at the Church of Our Lady in Bruges.<br>\n\nThe success that is now due to Pourbus is confirmed by his 1558 Piet\u00e0 at the \u00c9glise Saint-Maurice in Annecy and\nhis Adoration of the Golden Calf, painted around 1559, currently in show at the National Gallery in Dublin.<br>\n\nPourbus becomes the leading representative of the Italian High Renaissance as propagated in Antwerp by [[Frans_Floris|Frans Floris]]. This is a stylistic idiom that is completely contrary to the deep-seated gothic tradition. \nOne example of this high renaissance style is the grotesques in which he depicts the portraits of Mr and Mrs Ghuyse-Van Male.<br>\nAt this point, Pourbus\u2019 work features more translucent, confident brushwork and a clear composition style that manages to reconcile tradition and innovation. These aspects are readily apparent in the Van Belle triptych, in which he paraphrases the composition of Jan van Eyck\u2019s [[Virgin_and_Child_with_Canon_van_der_Paele|\"The Virgin and Child with Canon Van der Paele\"]] from 1436, which is now part of the collection at the Groeningemuseum in Bruges.<br>\nWith his innovation of the style, Pourbus makes his mark on the artistic production in Bruges and the surrounding area. As such, the Italian [[Lodovico_Guicciardini|Ludovico Guicciardini]] names him as one of the most important painters of his time in his ''\"Descrittione di tutti i Paesi Bassi\"'' or ''\"Description of all the Low Countries\"'' in 1567.<ref>Paul Huvenne, in Catalogue of the exhibition Feb.17 - June 17 2108 at Museum Gouda: Marc De Beyer & Josephina De Fauw, ''\"Pieter Pourbus, Master painter of Gouda\"'', 2018.  86 pages. page 16 to 20</ref>\n\n===== The leading painter in Bruges =====\n[[File:Portrait of a woman with unknown coat of arms, 1565 -National Galleries of Scotland, ,Edinburg.jpg|thumb |Pieter Pourbus - ''Portrait of a woman with unknown coat of arms'', 1565 - [https://www.nationalgalleries.org National Galleries of Scotland], Edinburg]]\nLancelot Blondeel passes away in 1561.<br>\n\nPourbus is now the leading painter in Bruges.<br>\n\nIn the years that follow, he teaches many an apprentice, including his son Frans, and [[Antoon_Claeissens|Antonius Claeissens]], who starts working for him at one point.<br>\n\nBusiness is going well, but artistically speaking, Pourbus appears to stagnate somewhat during this period.\nSeveral altar pieces that date from this period are a far cry from his best work. <br>\n\nHowever, he does show his skills as an exquisite portraitist from time to time, such as in this Portrait of a twenty-six years old woman from Edinburg. <br>\n\nIn spite of the coat of arms, this young lady has not yet been identified. It has been suggested that she might be part of the De Grave family, who are originally from Flanders but settled in Andalusia.\nIf so, this would once again be a nod to the Spanish presence in Bruges at the time.<br>\n\nThe portrait displays such immense refinement and grace that it was taken to be a portrait of Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots for much of the nineteenth century. <br>\n\nWith his smooth, enamel-like stylisation, Pourbus has imbued the woman\u2019s face with an introverted and enigmatic quality. <br>\nIt is reminiscent of [[Lodovico_Guicciardini|Guicciardini\u2019s]] assertions that in Bruges, ''\u2018the women are as beautiful, lovely, modest and temperate as in any city in these lands\u2019''.<br>\n\n[[File:Pieter Pourbus - Portrait of Jan Lopez Gallo and His Three Sons - WGA18256.jpg|thumb|left|Pieter Pourbus - ''Portrait of Jan Lopez Gallo and His Three Sons'', 1568 - [https://www.museabrugge.be/en/visit-our-museums/our-museums-and-monuments/groeningemuseum Groeningen Museum], Bruges]]\n[[File:Francois Van der Straeten.jpg|thumb|450pix|Pieter Pourbus - ''Portrait de Francois Van der Straeten'', 1567 - [https://www.museummayervandenbergh.be/en Mayer Van Den Bergh Museum], Anvers]]\n\nIn 1567, Pourbus produces yet another portrait, of Knight Fran\u00e7ois van der Straten. <br>\n\nHe draws inspiration from an allegorical print by Cornelis Theunisz from 1537 in which a child, an hourglass, and a skull remind one of the transience of life in much the same way.<br>\n\nVan der Straten was a leading authority in the Liberty of Bruges and an academically trained lawyer. <br>\n\nThe text that he points out on the note beneath his hand reads as follows: \"COGNITIO DEI ET NATVRAE RATIONANIS\" (''\"Knowledge of God and the Reasonable Nature\"'').<br>\nThis is a reference to his humanist view of life.<br>\nHis motto, \"ABSIT GLORIA\" (\"reject glory\"), once again brings to mind the notion of vanitas.<br>\n\nIn the same year, he also paints the portrait of Pieter de Corte, the freshly appointed bishop of the recently created bishopric of Bruges. <br>\nDe Corte was appointed by King Philip II of Spain. Considering the prestige involved in this commission, it was naturally granted to Pourbus.<br>\n\nHis Portrait of Juan Lopez Gallo and his sons, dating back to 1568, once again prove that the ties with his Spanish clientele had not weakened in the slightest.<br>\nHis work can even be found on the Canary Islands. There, Pourbus dealt with his clients\u2019 differing customs in a very special way, by adjusting the size of his retables to suit the size of altar that was customary in Spain at the time.<br>\nSometimes, he leaves the actual execution of paintings for his more distant clients to atelier staff, as shown in his \"Mount at Calvary\", presently in the Cathedral of San Pedro in Soria.<br>\n\n===== The year of the great map =====\nHis most important commission of the 1560s is the monumental Map of the Liberty of Bruges [fi g. 14]. <br>\nThe accounts allow us to trace Pourbus\u2019 steps almost on a daily basis during the many days he spends on this work. The documents tell us all about how he adapted existing materials or created new ones, who worked on the map with him, who came along with him (such as lawyers, surveyors, and magistrates), and how he repeatedly presented his progress to the client. He completed this magnum opus in 1571.<br>\n\n=== From 1570 to Pourbus death ===\n===== The 1570's =====\nAfter the enormous effort of the Great Map, it seems Pourbus had more time for regular commissions once\nagain. <br>\nHis students have since left his studio. His son [[Frans_Pourbus_the_Elder|Frans]] left for Antwerp in 1569 to make his fortune as a painter there, and [[Antonius Claeissens]] became the official city painter of Bruges in 1570. <br>\nPourbus continues to paint portraits without a moment\u2019s rest.[[File:Pieter Pourbus - Portrait of Olivier van Nieulant - WGA18257.jpg|thumb|left|200px| Pieter Pourbus - ''Portrait of Olivier van Nieulant'', 1573 - 49,5 \u00d7 37,5 cm, <br>[https://www.kmska.be/en Museum of Fine Arts], Antwerp]]\nHis style does change slightly, as evidenced by his portrait of Olivier Nieulant dated 1573, which is now in the Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp.\n\nHis brushwork becomes less transparent and more enamel-like. This shift is also apparent in his history paintings, such as the Altarpiece of St Hubert in the collection of Museum Gouda.\nThe shift lends a cooler appearance, a more classicist quality to his work, but also makes it slightly more rigid.<br>\n\nIt is remarkable how well Pourbus is able to focus his compositions or inventions on the Italian renaissance\nidiom, considering the fact that he never went to Italy.\nA good example of this, once again, is the Altarpiece of St Hubert, painted before 1572, which is praised by [[Karel_van_Mander|Mander]] as ''\u2018a beautiful temple, with the perspective very well done\u2019''.<br>\n\nUsually, Pourbus draws his inspiration for the Italian renaissance style from contemporary graphics such as those by D\u00fcrer, Raphael, and Titian. For example, he drew strongly on Titian for the middle panel of the Damhouder Triptych at the Church of Our Lady in Bruges, for which he also designed a frame entirely in line with the renaissance style.<br>\n\nAs a well-established painter, Pourbus is occasionally seen as too expensive during this period. <br>\nFor example, in autumn of 1571, he creates a design for an altarpiece for the Church of Our Lady in Damme, but a different, cheaper painter, Jacob van den Coornhuuse, is commissioned to do the work instead. <br>\n[[File:The Lamentation by Pieter Jansz. Pourbus.JPG|thumb|450px|Pieter Jansz. Pourbus. ''Lamentation''. [http://schorrcollection.org.uk Schorr Collection]. ]]\nEven so, Pourbus\u2019 studio continues to run smoothly throughout the 1570s. Among others, he works in close collaboration with [[Antoon_Claeissens|Antonius Claeissens]], who utilises Pourbus\u2019 style more than anyone else in Bruges in the early years of his career. <br>\nThe monumental piece \"Lamentation\" from the Schorr collection, one of the highlights of the exposition at Museum Gouda in 2018, is the result of intensive collaboration between the two.<br>\n\n===== Darker years =====\nIn 1578, a military force comes knocking on the city gates of Bruges. <br>\nThere is little resistance to the invading force. Just like Ghent before it, Bruges becomes a Calvinist republic. The city that barely felt the torrent of the Iconoclastic Fury in 1566 is unable to escape the stranglehold of the Eighty Years\u2019 War. <br>\nOnce the threat of war increases after the Pacification of Ghent fails, the city\u2019s magistrate repeatedly asks the Pourbus for his advice on building the city\u2019s defenses. His knowledge of water management, for instance, can be of use in flooding certain areas as a defensive manoeuvre.37<br>\nEven after the change in power that follows the city\u2019s capture in 1578, Pourbus continues to serve the now Protestant city authorities and enjoys the confidence of the magistrate. For example, he is appointed district head of his district in the Sint-Nicolaas-Zestendeel in December 1580. This may indicate that he converted\nto Calvinism, like his son. After all, the switch from Catholicism to Calvinism in Bruges means that Pourbus\nbecomes intimately entwined in the Protestant network.<br>\nHe had already painted the portraits of various prominent Protestants in previous years, such as the wartime mayor Jan Wyts and Calvinist leaders such as Pieter Dominicle.\nPourbus barely has time for painting during these years.<br>\n[[File:Zeghere van Male Pierter Pourbus 1578.jpg|thumb|350px|Pieter Pourbus''Zeghere van Male'', 1578]]\nHis epitaph for the Catholic Zeger van Male probably dates back to 1578, before the invasion by Ghent Protestants. During this period, Pourbus is mainly active as a water management expert and engineer.\nIn 1580, he paints a peculiar plan of the Abbey of the Dunes that was intended to serve as a guide for the\nreconstruction of the monastic complex after the war.\nApparently, he has enough credibility within the suppressed Catholic community left to be granted this commission. On the other hand, in autumn of that same year, he also creates the designs for the deconsecrated\nChurch of St Christopher (the site for which he painted the fishmongers\u2019 altar with his son only four years previ- ously) to be turned into a market hall, because it was no longer permitted to be used for worship.<br>\n\nPieter Pourbus dies in January of 1584.<br>\n\nHe may have been one of the many victims of the plague that strikes Bruges at the time. His widow, Anna Blondeel, is allocated a pension by both the city\u2019s magistrate and the Liberty of Bruges. Pourbus\u2019 memory is honored in many different ways. His portrait is hung in the guildhall as a memento to him.42<br>\n\n== Founding Father of a painting dynasty ==\nPourbus\u2019 oeuvre is often referred to as the swan song of the old Bruges school of painting. <br>\nAt the same time, he was also a notorious innovator. In terms of art history, he was the leading figure of his generation in Bruges.<br>\nHe is an all-round artist that practises his art in every register, from very simple matters to providing the\nLiberty\u2019s water authority with strategic advice.<br>\nStylistically speaking, he is part of the generation of [[Frans_Floris|Frans Floris]], the generation that realized the breakthrough of the Italian Renaissance in the Low Countries. The Joyous Entry of Charles V and prince Philip II, which dates from 1549, is a testament to that.<br>\n\nIt marks the perfect occasion for introducing the public to radical new innovations. As such, Pourbus manages\nto make a name for himself during his lifetime as one of the most important painters of his generation, both\nin Bruges and elsewhere; for example, Italian contem- poraries such as historian [[Lodovico Guicciardini|Ludovico Guicciardini]] and\nartist biographer [[Giorgio Vasari]] make mention of him.<br>\nPourbus develops a very recognizable hand, characterized by classicist restraint, with a restrained style that is dominated primarily by clear lines. <br>\nWhile comparing his artistic personality to contemporaries such as Maarten de Vos and Pieter Brueghel the Elder may force one to put his talent into a wider perspective, he is unmatched\nas a portraitist. <br>\nHe continues to surprise on that front throughout his entire career, both with individual\nportraits and group depictions. This sets him apart as an extraordinary visual chronicler of the eventful\nhistory of sixteenth-century Bruges.\nPourbus\u2019 influence on his immediate surroundings\npersists.43 <br>\nAs mentor to his son and grandson, [[Frans_Pourbus_the_Elder|Frans the Elder]] and [[Frans_Pourbus_the_Younger|Frans the Younger]], he gains international renown.<br>\nAs such, Pourbus is the founding father of an artistic lineage that will set the tone in the field of portraiture for three generations, until the arrival of the baroque portrait supersedes them.\n\n==Works==\n\nThe [[Groeningemuseum]] in Bruges displays many of his works.  <br>\nThe [https://www.museumgouda.nl/nl Gouda Museum] possesses also works by the artist. <br>\nThe Sint Janskerk and the [[Church of Our Lady, Bruges]] have some of his art on display.\n\n<gallery heights=\"225px\" widths=\"170px\">\nFile:Pieter Pourbus Portrait of Gentleman.jpg|''Portrait of a gentleman in armour'', [[Mus\u00e9e de Picardie]], France\nFile:Pieter Pourbus Christian van der Goes.jpg|''Portrait of [[Christian van der Goes]]'', 1574\nFile:Pieter Pourbus Portret1.jpg|''Portrait of Jan van Eyewerve'', 1551, [[Groeningemuseum]], Bruges\nFile:Pieter Pourbus Portret2.jpg|''Portrait of Jacquemyne Buuck'', 1551, [[Groeningemuseum]], Bruges\nFile:Pierre Pourbus - Bearded, red-headed Man, seated - Google Art Project.jpg|''Bearded, red-headed man, seated'', 1555\nFile:Pieter_Pourbus_._Portrait_of_a_young_lady.1554.signed_and_dated.jpg |''Portrait of a young noble lady'', Signed and dated 1554,  Private Collection\nFile:Laatste Avondmaal, 1548, [[Groeningemuseum]], 0040033000.jpg|''The last supper'', 1548,  Groeningemuseum, Bruges\nFile:Brugge Pieter Pourbus (1523-1584) - Het Laatste Avondmaal (1562) 9-03-2010 16-16-12kopie.jpg|thumb|''The Last Supper'', 1562, [[Church of Our Lady, Bruges\nFile:Pieter Pourbus - Allegory of true love.jpg|''Allegory of true love'', c.1547, [[Wallace Collection]]\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Publications ==\n# Paul Huvenne, ''Pierre Pourbus, peintre brugeois, 1524-1584,'' cat. exp., Mus\u00e9e Memling (H\u00f4pital Saint-Jean), 29 juin-30 septembre 1984, Bruges, Cr\u00e9dit Communal, 1984.\n# Paul Philippot, ''La Peinture dans les anciens Pays-Bas xve\u2009\u2013\u2009xvie si\u00e8cles'', Paris, Flammarion, 1994, 303 p., ({{ISBN|978-2-08010-937-8}}), p. 230-231.\n# Maryan W.

He must have been 19 or 20 years old at the time, based on the mentions of his age in a range of documents. From there, we can conclude that he must have been born in 1523 or 1524. <br>\n\nAt the occasion of the exhibition on Pieter Pourbus at the Gouda Museum in 2018, Paul Abels wrote in the catalogue of this exhibition on the role Gouda played in his life by putting what little is known about his ties to the city in the context of late-medieval religious and social life In Gouda.<ref>Article written by Paul H.A.M.

The accounts mention a payment made to him for \"painting the board that stands in front of the window\". The mention is brief, but it allows to corroborate [[Karel_van_Mander|Van Mander\u2019s]] claim about Pourbus\u2019 Gouda roots by another contemporary source. <br>\nThis source also shows that he was also a painter, although it is not possible to know what his real artistic skills were. The mention most likely refers to painting a (town\u2019s) coat of arms on a shutter.<ref>Paul H.A.M.

Catalogue of the exhibition Feb.17 - June 17 2108 at Museum Gouda. 86 pages</ref>\n\n===== From Gouda to Bruges =====\nPourbus\u2019 move to Bruges can be explained because Bruges is known to be a city that produces excellent painting, although that reputation is waning slightly when Pourbus arrives.<br>\nBruges is familiar territory for the Gouda residents. Pourbus will have heard many stories about the city of Bruges when growing up. The two cities are closely connected by the beer trade, which was the leading line of business in Gouda at the time.<br>\n\nBefore he went to Bruges, he may have studied his craft with Utrecht-based painters such as [[Jan_van_Scorel|Jan van Scorel]] or the Leiden masters. Recent technical research suggests Leiden, more so than Utrecht.<br>\n[[Lucas_van_Leyden|Lucas van Leyden]] and [[Cornelis_Engebrechtsz.|Cornelis Engelbrechtsz]] pass away when Pourbus is still a child, but he may have come into contact with Engelbrechtsz\u2019s three sons, [[Cornelis Cornelisz Kunst|Cornelis]], [[Lucas Cornelisz de Kock|Lucas]], and [[Pieter Cornelisz. Kunst]], who followed in their father\u2019s footsteps and became painters in their own right.<br>\n\n=== Pourbus in Bruges ===\nShortly after he registers with the \u2019Sculptors and Saddlers\u2019 Guild in Bruges in 1543 ( the Bruges \"[[Guild_of_Saint_Luke|Guild of Saint Luke]]\"), Pieter Pourbus marries. He weds Anna, the youngest daughter of painter [[Lancelot_Blondeel|Lancelot Blondeel]]. His marriage to the daughter of an established artist lacking any male heirs is very important for his reputation and further career as a master painter.<ref>from the article written by Paul H.A.M. Abels, \u00a7. page 34, in: Marc De Beyer & Josephina De Fauw, ''\"Pieter Pourbus, Master painter of Gouda\"'', 2018.

Pourbus integrates into the city of Bruges with ease. <br>\nHe becomes a member of the crossbowmen\u2019s guild of St George and often visits the rhetorician meetings organised by the Chamber of the Holy Spirit. [[Lancelot_Blondeel|Blondeel]], who is a well-respected person there, may have introduced him.<br>\nIt is unclear where Pourbus\u2019 initial training as a painter took place.

From this moment on, his name starts appearing in all sorts of historical documents with great frequency. <br>\nHe is named yearly, and sometimes even daily, in many official sources. <br>\nSome notable commissions will also have played a role in increasing his fame, such as the decorations for the Joyous entry of Charles V and prince Philip II in 1549 (\u2018Blijde intocht van Karel V en prins Filips in 1549\u2019), a design for a new banquet hall, and a ''\"Last Judgment\"'' (''\u2018Laatste Oordeel\u2019''); all of these are commissions for the so-called ''\u2018Brugse Vrije\u2019'' (also known as the Liberty of Bruges), the legally autonomous territory of Bruges.<br>\n\nAnother prominent commission was his works for the mausoleum of Margaret of Austria at the Annunciation Convent in Bruges, which the magnificent Annunciation currently displayed at Museum Gouda was part of.\nPourbus gradually became the preferred master painter of the bourgeoisie, such as wine merchant Jan van Eyewerve and his wife Jacquemyne Buuck. They had their portraits painted to celebrate their wedding. <br>\n\nThe fact that Pourbus expressly dates and signs his works throughout this period is indicative of the rise in his confidence.<br>\n\n\nPourbus also made many topographic maps. <br>\nHe began using a new methodology based on triangulation that resulted in very modern-looking maps.13 It was a new format for visual reports intended to support surveyors\u2019 legal reports. <br>\nIt is unknown how Pourbus obtained this knowledge, but his 1549 map of the canal between Damme and Sluis indicates that he was most likely already using the new technique at that time, constituting a grand innovative move in 1540s Bruges.<br>\nAll of this hard work paid off: in 1552, Pourbus bought Huis Rome (\u2018the Rome House\u2019) on the Heer Jan Admiraelstraat. [[Karel_van_Mander|Van Mander]] later writes that here, Pourbus set up the best painting studio he ever saw.<ref>Paul Huvenne, in Catalogue of the exhibition Feb.17 - June 17 2108 at Museum Gouda: Marc De Beyer & Josephina De Fauw, ''Pieter Pourbus, Master painter of Gouda'', 2018. 86 pages. \u00a7.2 page 13</ref>\n\n===== Active Guild member =====\nAs from 1551, Pourbus became a prominent and active member of his guild\u2019s council; he served two terms as dean of the guild and five terms as sworn elder. He was very committed to his guild duties; for example, as an elder, he participated in quality checks on fellow guild members. He visited Simon Puseel in response to the latter\u2019s poor performance in gilding the dome of the Jerusalem Chapel in Bruges. As a dean, he acted to prevent paintings from Dordrecht being sold inside the city walls. He also defended the guild\u2019s interests several times in the leasing of land it owned in the province of Zeeland. Clearly, Pourbus was a very active and committed member of the Bruges Guild of Sculptors and Saddlers.<ref>Paul Huvenne, in Catalogue of the exhibition Feb.17 - June 17 2108 at Museum Gouda: Marc De Beyer & Josephina De Fauw, ''Pieter Pourbus, Master painter of Gouda'', 2018. 86 pages. \u00a7.2 page 16</ref>\n\n=== Pourbus\u2019 best years ===\nThe decade following his breakthrough in 1550 boasts the best work of his career.<br>\n\n===== Pourbus truly surpasses himself as a portraitist =====\nPourbus\u2019 fine portrait of Joris (?) van den Heede, whose family motto \"sint sine dentes sales\" (\"be witty without spite\") was taken word for word from Erasmus\u2019 introduction to \"In Praise of Folly\", is reminiscent of that of Jan van Eyewerve.\n\nAnd with his portraits of \"Pieter Dominicle and his wife Livina van der Beke\", Pourbus truly surpasses himself as a portraitist.<br>\n[[File:Pieter Pourbus .

In doing so, he endows the person depicted with a detached, but animated beauty that leaves no one unmoved\"<ref>Paul Huvenne, in Catalogue of the exhibition Feb.17 - June 17 2108 at Museum Gouda: Marc De Beyer & Josephina De Fauw, ''Pieter Pourbus, Master painter of Gouda'', 2018. 86 pages. \u00a7.3 page 16 and 17</ref>.<br>\nIn an article published at the occasion of the exhibition at the Gouda Museum, another author describes this portrait as [https://marccouwenbergh.nl/de-mona-lisa-van-pieter-pourbus-meester-schilder-uit-gouda/ '''the Mona Lisa of Pourbus\"'']. <br>\nMoreover, in a detailed following article<ref>https://marccouwenbergh.nl/anna-van-bueren-versus-de-mona-lisa-van-pieter-pourbus-meester-schilder-uit-gouda/</ref>, he draws attention on many similarities between this portrait and the portrait of [[Anna van Egmont]], first wife of [[William the Silent|William of Orange]], belonging to the Royal collection, The Hague. The comparison can also be found [[Anna_van_Egmont#A_newly_discovered_portrait_of_Anna_van_Egmont?|here]].<br>\n\nHis art as a portraitist is also revealed during this decade by group portraits that are second to none. <br>\nThe wing-panels with portraits of the Members of the Noble Confraternity of the Holy Blood and the Sacra Confrerie of St Salvators is a wonderful example. <br>\nThe position of the sitters suggest that Pourbus must have envisioned the work of Utrecht-based painter [[Jan_van_Scorel|Jan van Scorel]].<br>\n\n===== History painter  =====\nPourbus is now also able to prove himself as a history painter.<br>\n\nHe follows up on his impressive Last Judgment, now part of the Groeningemuseum\u2019s collection, and the beautiful Annunciation in Museum Gouda with the smaller Crucifixion in 1557.<br>\n[[File:Pourbus-Vanbelle-Triptiek.jpg|thumb|left|500px|Pourbus - ''\"Van Belle Triptych\"'',1556 - St James' church, Bruges]]\nBut more than any other work, the Van Belle triptych illustrates how Pourbus\u2019 style has matured.<br>\nIn many ways, this triptych is a key piece in his oeuvre, not only because it is one of his best paintings, but also because it is so well documented in archival materials.\nFor example, one of the items that survived is the original design drawing that Pourbus presented to Joos Van Belle for his approval.<br>\nThe sheet bears handwritten comments, in which the artist agrees to portray the Madonna not with clenched hands but in a more resigned posture: ''\u2018with the arms pressed crosswise over one another\u2019''. The theme of Our Lady of the Seven Sorrows on the middle panel was a very popular one in Pourbus\u2019 day, and it will have been quite a challenge for the artist to come up with a new, convincing composition to depict the theme.\nPourbus\u2019 depiction of the Virgin Mary owes much to the statue of the Madonna with Child by Michelangelo at the Church of Our Lady in Bruges.<br>\n\nThe success that is now due to Pourbus is confirmed by his 1558 Piet\u00e0 at the \u00c9glise Saint-Maurice in Annecy and\nhis Adoration of the Golden Calf, painted around 1559, currently in show at the National Gallery in Dublin.<br>\n\nPourbus becomes the leading representative of the Italian High Renaissance as propagated in Antwerp by [[Frans_Floris|Frans Floris]]. This is a stylistic idiom that is completely contrary to the deep-seated gothic tradition. \nOne example of this high renaissance style is the grotesques in which he depicts the portraits of Mr and Mrs Ghuyse-Van Male.<br>\nAt this point, Pourbus\u2019 work features more translucent, confident brushwork and a clear composition style that manages to reconcile tradition and innovation. These aspects are readily apparent in the Van Belle triptych, in which he paraphrases the composition of Jan van Eyck\u2019s [[Virgin_and_Child_with_Canon_van_der_Paele|\"The Virgin and Child with Canon Van der Paele\"]] from 1436, which is now part of the collection at the Groeningemuseum in Bruges.<br>\nWith his innovation of the style, Pourbus makes his mark on the artistic production in Bruges and the surrounding area. As such, the Italian [[Lodovico_Guicciardini|Ludovico Guicciardini]] names him as one of the most important painters of his time in his ''\"Descrittione di tutti i Paesi Bassi\"'' or ''\"Description of all the Low Countries\"'' in 1567.<ref>Paul Huvenne, in Catalogue of the exhibition Feb.17 - June 17 2108 at Museum Gouda: Marc De Beyer & Josephina De Fauw, ''\"Pieter Pourbus, Master painter of Gouda\"'', 2018.  86 pages. page 16 to 20</ref>\n\n===== The leading painter in Bruges =====\n[[File:Portrait of a woman with unknown coat of arms, 1565 -National Galleries of Scotland, ,Edinburg.jpg|thumb |Pieter Pourbus - ''Portrait of a woman with unknown coat of arms'', 1565 - [https://www.nationalgalleries.org National Galleries of Scotland], Edinburg]]\nLancelot Blondeel passes away in 1561.<br>\n\nPourbus is now the leading painter in Bruges.<br>\n\nIn the years that follow, he teaches many an apprentice, including his son Frans, and [[Antoon_Claeissens|Antonius Claeissens]], who starts working for him at one point.<br>\n\nBusiness is going well, but artistically speaking, Pourbus appears to stagnate somewhat during this period.\nSeveral altar pieces that date from this period are a far cry from his best work. <br>\n\nHowever, he does show his skills as an exquisite portraitist from time to time, such as in this Portrait of a twenty-six years old woman from Edinburg. <br>\n\nIn spite of the coat of arms, this young lady has not yet been identified. It has been suggested that she might be part of the De Grave family, who are originally from Flanders but settled in Andalusia.\nIf so, this would once again be a nod to the Spanish presence in Bruges at the time.<br>\n\nThe portrait displays such immense refinement and grace that it was taken to be a portrait of Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots for much of the nineteenth century. <br>\n\nWith his smooth, enamel-like stylisation, Pourbus has imbued the woman\u2019s face with an introverted and enigmatic quality. <br>\nIt is reminiscent of [[Lodovico_Guicciardini|Guicciardini\u2019s]] assertions that in Bruges, ''\u2018the women are as beautiful, lovely, modest and temperate as in any city in these lands\u2019''.<br>\n\n[[File:Pieter Pourbus - Portrait of Jan Lopez Gallo and His Three Sons - WGA18256.jpg|thumb|left|Pieter Pourbus - ''Portrait of Jan Lopez Gallo and His Three Sons'', 1568 - [https://www.museabrugge.be/en/visit-our-museums/our-museums-and-monuments/groeningemuseum Groeningen Museum], Bruges]]\n[[File:Francois Van der Straeten.jpg|thumb|450pix|Pieter Pourbus - ''Portrait de Francois Van der Straeten'', 1567 - [https://www.museummayervandenbergh.be/en Mayer Van Den Bergh Museum], Anvers]]\n\nIn 1567, Pourbus produces yet another portrait, of Knight Fran\u00e7ois van der Straten. <br>\n\nHe draws inspiration from an allegorical print by Cornelis Theunisz from 1537 in which a child, an hourglass, and a skull remind one of the transience of life in much the same way.<br>\n\nVan der Straten was a leading authority in the Liberty of Bruges and an academically trained lawyer. <br>\n\nThe text that he points out on the note beneath his hand reads as follows: \"COGNITIO DEI ET NATVRAE RATIONANIS\" (''\"Knowledge of God and the Reasonable Nature\"'').<br>\nThis is a reference to his humanist view of life.<br>\nHis motto, \"ABSIT GLORIA\" (\"reject glory\"), once again brings to mind the notion of vanitas.<br>\n\nIn the same year, he also paints the portrait of Pieter de Corte, the freshly appointed bishop of the recently created bishopric of Bruges. <br>\nDe Corte was appointed by King Philip II of Spain. Considering the prestige involved in this commission, it was naturally granted to Pourbus.<br>\n\nHis Portrait of Juan Lopez Gallo and his sons, dating back to 1568, once again prove that the ties with his Spanish clientele had not weakened in the slightest.<br>\nHis work can even be found on the Canary Islands. There, Pourbus dealt with his clients\u2019 differing customs in a very special way, by adjusting the size of his retables to suit the size of altar that was customary in Spain at the time.<br>\nSometimes, he leaves the actual execution of paintings for his more distant clients to atelier staff, as shown in his \"Mount at Calvary\", presently in the Cathedral of San Pedro in Soria.<br>\n\n===== The year of the great map =====\nHis most important commission of the 1560s is the monumental Map of the Liberty of Bruges [fi g. 14]. <br>\nThe accounts allow us to trace Pourbus\u2019 steps almost on a daily basis during the many days he spends on this work. The documents tell us all about how he adapted existing materials or created new ones, who worked on the map with him, who came along with him (such as lawyers, surveyors, and magistrates), and how he repeatedly presented his progress to the client. He completed this magnum opus in 1571.<br>\n\n=== From 1570 to Pourbus death ===\n===== The 1570's =====\nAfter the enormous effort of the Great Map, it seems Pourbus had more time for regular commissions once\nagain. <br>\nHis students have since left his studio. His son [[Frans_Pourbus_the_Elder|Frans]] left for Antwerp in 1569 to make his fortune as a painter there, and [[Antonius Claeissens]] became the official city painter of Bruges in 1570. <br>\nPourbus continues to paint portraits without a moment\u2019s rest.[[File:Pieter Pourbus - Portrait of Olivier van Nieulant - WGA18257.jpg|thumb|left| Pieter Pourbus - ''Portrait of Olivier van Nieulant'', 1573 - 49,5 \u00d7 37,5 cm, <br>[https://www.kmska.be/en Museum of Fine Arts], Antwerp]]\nHis style does change slightly, as evidenced by his portrait of Olivier Nieulant dated 1573, which is now in the Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp.\n\nHis brushwork becomes less transparent and more enamel-like. This shift is also apparent in his history paintings, such as the Altarpiece of St Hubert in the collection of Museum Gouda.\nThe shift lends a cooler appearance, a more classicist quality to his work, but also makes it slightly more rigid.<br>\n\nIt is remarkable how well Pourbus is able to focus his compositions or inventions on the Italian renaissance\nidiom, considering the fact that he never went to Italy.\nA good example of this, once again, is the Altarpiece of St Hubert, painted before 1572, which is praised by [[Karel_van_Mander|Mander]] as ''\u2018a beautiful temple, with the perspective very well done\u2019''.<br>\n\nUsually, Pourbus draws his inspiration for the Italian renaissance style from contemporary graphics such as those by D\u00fcrer, Raphael, and Titian. For example, he drew strongly on Titian for the middle panel of the Damhouder Triptych at the Church of Our Lady in Bruges, for which he also designed a frame entirely in line with the renaissance style.<br>\n\nAs a well-established painter, Pourbus is occasionally seen as too expensive during this period. <br>\nFor example, in autumn of 1571, he creates a design for an altarpiece for the Church of Our Lady in Damme, but a different, cheaper painter, Jacob van den Coornhuuse, is commissioned to do the work instead. <br>\n[[File:The Lamentation by Pieter Jansz. Pourbus.JPG|thumb|450px|Pieter Jansz. Pourbus. ''Lamentation''. [http://schorrcollection.org.uk Schorr Collection]. ]]\nEven so, Pourbus\u2019 studio continues to run smoothly throughout the 1570s. Among others, he works in close collaboration with [[Antoon_Claeissens|Antonius Claeissens]], who utilises Pourbus\u2019 style more than anyone else in Bruges in the early years of his career. <br>\nThe monumental piece \"Lamentation\" from the Schorr collection, one of the highlights of the exposition at Museum Gouda in 2018, is the result of intensive collaboration between the two.<br>\n\n===== Darker years =====\nIn 1578, a military force comes knocking on the city gates of Bruges. <br>\nThere is little resistance to the invading force. Just like Ghent before it, Bruges becomes a Calvinist republic. The city that barely felt the torrent of the Iconoclastic Fury in 1566 is unable to escape the stranglehold of the Eighty Years\u2019 War. <br>\nOnce the threat of war increases after the Pacification of Ghent fails, the city\u2019s magistrate repeatedly asks the Pourbus for his advice on building the city\u2019s defenses. His knowledge of water management, for instance, can be of use in flooding certain areas as a defensive manoeuvre.37<br>\nEven after the change in power that follows the city\u2019s capture in 1578, Pourbus continues to serve the now Protestant city authorities and enjoys the confidence of the magistrate. For example, he is appointed district head of his district in the Sint-Nicolaas-Zestendeel in December 1580. This may indicate that he converted\nto Calvinism, like his son. After all, the switch from Catholicism to Calvinism in Bruges means that Pourbus\nbecomes intimately entwined in the Protestant network.<br>\nHe had already painted the portraits of various prominent Protestants in previous years, such as the wartime mayor Jan Wyts and Calvinist leaders such as Pieter Dominicle.\nPourbus barely has time for painting during these years.<br>\n[[File:Zeghere van Male Pierter Pourbus 1578.jpg|thumb|350px|Pieter Pourbus''Zeghere van Male'', 1578]]\nHis epitaph for the Catholic Zeger van Male probably dates back to 1578, before the invasion by Ghent Protestants. During this period, Pourbus is mainly active as a water management expert and engineer.\nIn 1580, he paints a peculiar plan of the Abbey of the Dunes that was intended to serve as a guide for the\nreconstruction of the monastic complex after the war.\nApparently, he has enough credibility within the suppressed Catholic community left to be granted this commission. On the other hand, in autumn of that same year, he also creates the designs for the deconsecrated\nChurch of St Christopher (the site for which he painted the fishmongers\u2019 altar with his son only four years previ- ously) to be turned into a market hall, because it was no longer permitted to be used for worship.<br>\n\nPieter Pourbus dies in January of 1584.<br>\n\nHe may have been one of the many victims of the plague that strikes Bruges at the time. His widow, Anna Blondeel, is allocated a pension by both the city\u2019s magistrate and the Liberty of Bruges. Pourbus\u2019 memory is honored in many different ways. His portrait is hung in the guildhall as a memento to him.42<br>\n\n== Founding Father of a painting dynasty ==\nPourbus\u2019 oeuvre is often referred to as the swan song of the old Bruges school of painting. <br>\nAt the same time, he was also a notorious innovator. In terms of art history, he was the leading figure of his generation in Bruges.<br>\nHe is an all-round artist that practises his art in every register, from very simple matters to providing the\nLiberty\u2019s water authority with strategic advice.<br>\nStylistically speaking, he is part of the generation of [[Frans_Floris|Frans Floris]], the generation that realized the breakthrough of the Italian Renaissance in the Low Countries. The Joyous Entry of Charles V and prince Philip II, which dates from 1549, is a testament to that.<br>\n\nIt marks the perfect occasion for introducing the public to radical new innovations. As such, Pourbus manages\nto make a name for himself during his lifetime as one of the most important painters of his generation, both\nin Bruges and elsewhere; for example, Italian contem- poraries such as historian [[Lodovico Guicciardini|Ludovico Guicciardini]] and\nartist biographer [[Giorgio Vasari]] make mention of him.<br>\nPourbus develops a very recognizable hand, characterized by classicist restraint, with a restrained style that is dominated primarily by clear lines. <br>\nWhile comparing his artistic personality to contemporaries such as Maarten de Vos and Pieter Brueghel the Elder may force one to put his talent into a wider perspective, he is unmatched\nas a portraitist. <br>\nHe continues to surprise on that front throughout his entire career, both with individual\nportraits and group depictions. This sets him apart as an extraordinary visual chronicler of the eventful\nhistory of sixteenth-century Bruges.\nPourbus\u2019 influence on his immediate surroundings\npersists.43 <br>\nAs mentor to his son and grandson, [[Frans_Pourbus_the_Elder|Frans the Elder]] and [[Frans_Pourbus_the_Younger|Frans the Younger]], he gains international renown.<br>\nAs such, Pourbus is the founding father of an artistic lineage that will set the tone in the field of portraiture for three generations, until the arrival of the baroque portrait supersedes them.\n\n==Works==\n\nThe [[Groeningemuseum]] in Bruges displays many of his works.  <br>\nThe [https://www.museumgouda.nl/nl Gouda Museum] possesses also works by the artist. <br>\nThe Sint Janskerk and the [[Church of Our Lady, Bruges]] have some of his art on display.\n\n<gallery heights=\"225px\" widths=\"170px\">\nFile:Pieter Pourbus Portrait of Gentleman.jpg|''Portrait of a gentleman in armour'', [[Mus\u00e9e de Picardie]], France\nFile:Pieter Pourbus Christian van der Goes.jpg|''Portrait of [[Christian van der Goes]]'', 1574\nFile:Pieter Pourbus Portret1.jpg|''Portrait of Jan van Eyewerve'', 1551, [[Groeningemuseum]], Bruges\nFile:Pieter Pourbus Portret2.jpg|''Portrait of Jacquemyne Buuck'', 1551, [[Groeningemuseum]], Bruges\nFile:Pierre Pourbus - Bearded, red-headed Man, seated - Google Art Project.jpg|''Bearded, red-headed man, seated'', 1555\nFile:Pieter_Pourbus_._Portrait_of_a_young_lady.1554.signed_and_dated.jpg |''Portrait of a young noble lady'', Signed and dated 1554,  Private Collection\nFile:Laatste Avondmaal, 1548, [[Groeningemuseum]], 0040033000.jpg|''The last supper'', 1548,  Groeningemuseum, Bruges\nFile:Brugge Pieter Pourbus (1523-1584) - Het Laatste Avondmaal (1562) 9-03-2010 16-16-12kopie.jpg|thumb|''The Last Supper'', 1562, [[Church of Our Lady, Bruges\nFile:Pieter Pourbus - Allegory of true love.jpg|''Allegory of true love'', c.1547, [[Wallace Collection]]\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Publications ==\n# Paul Huvenne, ''Pierre Pourbus, peintre brugeois, 1524-1584,'' cat. exp., Mus\u00e9e Memling (H\u00f4pital Saint-Jean), 29 juin-30 septembre 1984, Bruges, Cr\u00e9dit Communal, 1984.\n# Paul Philippot, ''La Peinture dans les anciens Pays-Bas xve\u2009\u2013\u2009xvie si\u00e8cles'', Paris, Flammarion, 1994, 303 p., ({{ISBN|978-2-08010-937-8}}), p. 230-231.\n# Maryan W.

Ayuntamiento de Saucedilla, 1994</ref> ({{IPA-es|sau\u032f.\u03b8e\u02c8\u00f0i.\u028ea}}) is a municipality located in the [[C\u00e1ceres (province)|province of C\u00e1ceres]], [[Extremadura]], Spain. According to the 2010 [[census]] ([[Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica (Spain)|INE]]), it has a population of 859 inhabitants.\nIt belongs to the Campo Ara\u00f1uelo County ([[Comarca]] del Campo Ara\u00f1uelo), the capital of which is [[Navalmoral de la Mata]].\n\n== Geography and nature ==\n\nThe situation of Saucedilla is impressive. In the north, the vast bulk of the [[Sierra de Gredos]] and the [[Ti\u00e9tar River]]; in the south and west, the Miravete Sierra ([[Casas de Miravete]]), the [[Tagus River]] (''Tajo'' in Spanish) and the [[Serrej\u00f3n]] Sierra. \nThe climate is Mediterranean. The village stands in an extensive plain of clayey grounds.\n\n===Dehesa===\n\nThe municipality is surrounded by immense ''dehesas''. A [[dehesa (pastoral management)|dehesa]] is a light wood of holm oaks (''[[Quercus ilex]]'') or cork oaks (''[[Quercus suber]]''). There, the breeding ([[animal husbandry]]) of cattle, sheep (for meat and wool), goats (for meat and cheese), and pigs, ([[Iberian pig]]) for meat like [[jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico]] (Iberian ham) and [[jam\u00f3n serrano]], are common. The breeding of [[fighting bull]]s (''toro bravo'' in Spanish) is also widespread. There are some  '''''ganader\u00edas''''' of these wild bulls in Saucedilla (''Cerro Alto'', ''La Anguila'') and others nearby villages like [[Casatejada]] or  [[Toril, C\u00e1ceres|Toril]].\n\n===Arrocampo Reservoir===\n\n[[Arrocampo Reservoir]] was created at 1976 to cool the turbines of the [[Almaraz]] [[nuclear power plant]], which is near Saucedilla. With a system of [[dam]]s and [[dike (flood prevention)|dike]]s, the water, taken from [[Tagus]] river, covers a circuit of 11&nbsp;km which allow the cooling of these turbines.\n\n:* [[Biomass (ecology)]]: there are a considerable masses of [[phytoplankton]] and [[zooplankton]] thanks to the [[eutrophication]] and [[Water oxygenation|oxygenation]] of waters. The bulrush ([[Typha latifolia]]) vegetation is dominant in Arrocampo. It allows the proliferation of birds and little mammals.\n\n:* Fishes: barbels (''[[Barbus barbus]]''), [[common carp]]s (''[[Cyprinus carpio]]''), tenches (''[[Tinca tinca]]''), big largemouth bass (''[[Micropterus salmoides]]'') (almost 50 cm).\n\n:* Actually, it is an important [[Special Protection Area]] ([[Special Protection Area|SPA]]) for wild birds. (In Spanish: ''Zona Especial de Protecci\u00f3n para las Aves'', ZEPA.) A lot of it -migrant o permanent birds- can be watched in the reservoir waters or nearness of it: [[white stork]] (''Ciconia ciconia''), [[lesser kestrel]] (''Falco naumanni''), [[purple heron]] (''Ardea purpurea''), [[squacco heron]] (''Ardeola ralloides''), [[black-crowned night heron]] (''Nycticorax nycticorax''), [[little bittern]] (''Ixobrychus minutus''), [[osprey]] (''Pandion haliaetus''), [[cattle egret]] (''Bubulcus ibis''), [[great cormorant]] (''Phalacrocorax carbo''), [[purple swamphen]] (''Porphyrio porphyrio''). This is, perhaps, the bird symbol of Arrocampo Reservoir SPA). The list is practically endless.\n:\n\n=== ''Ca\u00f1ada Real Leonesa Occidental'' (main droveway of Western Le\u00f3n) ===\n\nSaucedilla was always a land of sheep. (Its coat of arms has a head of [[Sheep|ram]].) [[Extremadura]] (and Saucedilla), was a passing and [[transhumance]] land from the Middle Age. In medieval Spain, there were droving flocks of sheep on the largest scale, which were carefully organized by the system of the [[Mesta]], crossing Extremadura and other Spanish regions. These long distance movements of sheep and cattle were made along [[drovers road]] called ''ca\u00f1adas reales'' in Castile, ''caba\u00f1eras'' in Aragon, ''carreradas'' in Catalonia. The ''Ca\u00f1ada Real Leonesa Occidental'' cross Saucedilla by the south, near the cemetery. There is a country house, close the graveyard, for sheepherds and cowherds who cover the droveway still today.\n\n===Irrigated lands===\n\n:* Long ago, the  economic activity of Saucedilla was based only on traditional agriculture. During centuries, there was a subsistence [[farming]] (dry farming), with also the breeding of sheep, goats, cattle and pigs. This agriculture has produced cereals for years and years in Saucedilla lands: [[wheat]], [[barley]], [[oat]]s, [[rye]], [[chickpea]]s, [[broad bean]]s and [[root vegetables]] like [[turnip]]s. Also olives and wine.\n[[File:Purple Swamphen - Pukeko02.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Purple swamphen]], a characteristic wild bird of Arrocampo]]\n:* The new irrigation farming: the Valdeca\u00f1as Reservoir upon the Tagus (on southeast of the municipality), and the construction of a lot of channels, were made possible to irrigate many farmlands of Saucedilla. Fodder for cows and sheep, fruits like [[tomato]]es, [[pimiento]]s, [[bell pepper]]s, [[peach]]es, etc., are produced thanks to the arrival of water in the 1980s.\n\n=== Special Protection Areas===\n\nThere are two [[Special Protection Area]]s (SPAs) in Saucedilla.
