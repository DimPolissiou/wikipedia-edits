He died in [[Los Angeles]] aged 72, leaving most of his \u00a370m fortune to his son Lucas.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/richlist/person/0,,38845,00.html/ ''Sunday Times'' Rich List]</ref>\n\n==Early life ==\nWhite attended De Aston School in [[Market Rasen]], [[Lincolnshire]].  He was a [[Royal Air Force]] pilot during [[World War II]] in clandestine operations in [[India]], [[Burma]] and [[Thailand]]. It was during the war that White became friends with Bill Hanson, British show-jumping star and younger brother of [[James Hanson, Baron Hanson|James Hanson]].\n\nTemperamentally and perhaps because of his wartime experiences, after the war White was more interested in having fun than working.  Possessed of considerable panache, he set himself up as a Hollywood impresario in the early 1950s. He was a governor of the [[British Film Institute]], 1982\u20134.\n\nBill Hanson died aged 27 of cancer, leaving his bereaved elder brother James with the duty of carrying on the Hanson business name.  White became a surrogate brother to James, and was eventually the brains of the Hanson takeover machine.<ref>Obituary: Lord Hanson - Wheeler-dealer who rose to greater fortune in the Thatcher years; Roger Cowe; Wednesday November 3, 2004; Guardian; referred to below as ''Lord Hanson obituary''</ref>\n\n==Early career ==\nIn 1958 in one of their first business ventures together he and [[James Hanson, Baron Hanson|James Hanson]] hit on the idea of importing jokey American greetings cards, then largely unknown in Britain.  The business trading as Hanson White became one of Britain's largest suppliers of greeting cards, giftwrap and giftware and was sold to a management buy-out for \u00a310.8m in 1997.\n\nThe pair's entry into serious business, and the world of takeovers, came through White's connection to [[Jim Slater (accountant)|Jim Slater]], the accountant turned stock market whizz kid who introduced them to the potential in public company shares.  White and Hanson concentrated on emulating Slater's takeover techniques, building up a public company through acquisitions and disposals.<ref name=\"Lord Hanson obituary\">''Lord Hanson obituary''</ref>\n\nBy 1964 he and Hanson had started to build up Hanson Trust out of the former Wiles Group.  [[Hanson plc]] turned into one of the largest [[United Kingdom|British]]-owned conglomerates with annual profits of more than \u00a31.5 billion and a strategy of growth through acquisition.  From 1965-73 White was deputy chairman of Hanson Trust Ltd.\n\n==Personal life ==\nIn 1973 White left Britain for [[New York City]] where he developed Hanson's [[United States|American]] holdings.\n\nHe married three times. His first marriage, to Elisabeth Kalen, the daughter of a Swedish diplomat, produced daughters Sita and Carolina,<ref>https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/the-tragedy-of-sita-heiress-entangled-in-a-murky-business-51729.html</ref> and the second, to an American actress, [[Virginia North]] (whom he divorced in 1991), gave him a son, Lucas. After the divorce he lived with a former model, Victoria Tucker, 40 years his junior. The couple married in a registry office in Hamilton, Bermuda, in 1992.<ref>Obituary: Lord White of Hull, [[The Independent]]_25 August 1995 . . https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-lord-white-of-hull-1597826.html</ref>\n\nHe remained chairman of Hanson Industries [[North America]], [[Iselin, New Jersey]] from 1973 until his death.\n\n<blockquote>Perhaps the most successful British buccaneer in America is the canny, soft- spoken Sir Gordon White, 64, chairman of Hanson Industries, the U.S. investing arm of London's Hanson Trust conglomerate. Hanson employs more than 35,000 workers in the eight U.S. firms it has acquired since 1973. Among the prizes: SCM, manufacturer of Smith-Corona typewriters, and Endicott Johnson, the shoe retailer. White's current target is Kidde, a maker of products ranging from Farberware kitchen utensils to Jacuzzi Whirlpool Baths. Hanson has made an offer for Kidde, and a successful deal would double the firm's U.S. employment roster. So far White has spent $2 billion on his acquisitions.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,147563,00.html/ Time Magazine]</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Business ventures ==\nUnlike Slater, White and Hanson survived the British slump in the early 1970s, but the \"quantum leap\" which had been promised to shareholders did not come until 1979, the beginning of the [[Margaret Thatcher]] era, which saw a move toward capitalism and a new respect for businessmen such as White and Hanson, who were not afraid to take on trade unions and break up established companies in pursuit of profit.<ref name=\"Lord Hanson obituary\"/>  In the 1970s and 80s White and Hanson turned the Hanson group into a multinational encompassing, amongst others, US chemical factories, UK electricity suppliers and Australian gold mines.  The Hanson group's other products included batteries, cigarettes, cod liver oil capsules, cranes, golf clubs, Jacuzzis, timber and toys.\n\nFrom 1979 to 1986, Hanson Trust stalked its prey on both sides of the [[Atlantic Ocean]], acquiring a succession of ever-larger companies, often in hard-fought takeover battles planned and directed by White but fronted by Hanson.  At this time White and Hanson were giving millions of pounds to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].  Successful acquisitions included the [[British Ever Ready Electrical Company|Ever Ready]] company Berec, the retail group UDS, and finally [[Imperial Group]] which included hotels, the [[Courage (brewery)]] and [[Golden Wonder]] crisps.\n\nAt almost \u00a32bn, the [[Imperial Group]] takeover set the record as Britain's biggest.  It also set the record as the bitterest. The fight was a public one, through full-page newspaper advertisements; but behind the scenes private investigators sought, unsuccessfully, to prove allegations of criminal activities in US side of business which was White's domain.\n\nThe fight for Imperial took its toll. In 1986 ''[[The Times]]'' focused on a controversial attempt to take \u00a370m from the [[Courage (brewery)]] pension fund.  In the City there was speculation as to how the takeover juggernaut could keep going with its aim to acquire ever-larger targets, and as Hanson and White passed normal retirement age there was speculation as to their succession plans. Neither had any intention of stepping down, but attempts to continue the proven method were, not surprisingly, becoming more difficult not least as the class of possible targets got smaller.\n\nThen there was the issue of the pair's political connection.  In November 1990, Thatcher was ousted as prime minister, seriously weakening the pair's political support.   Perhaps as a consolation prize, White was given a [[life peerage]] in the [[resignation honours]] list (Hanson had been made a life peer in 1983). Prior to being created a [[life peer]] with the title '''Baron White of Hull''', ''of [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] in the [[County of Humberside]] on 25 January 1991'',<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=52437 |date=31 January 1991 |page=1603}}</ref> White had been appointed [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (KBE) in the [[1979 Birthday Honours]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=47869 |date=16 June 1979 |page=7 |supp=y}}</ref> The reduction in political support, signalled by Thatcher's resignation and honours notwithstanding, was the beginning of the end of the pair's takeover career.\n\nIn 1991 White and Hanson bid for [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] (\"ICI\"), one of the commanding heights of [[United Kingdom|British]] industry, in what was supposed to be the ultimate takeover.   Apart from being symbolic of Britain's manufacturing and research base, ICI had plants and offices all over Britain, which made it a highly political issue for the many members of parliament whose constituents might be affected - including several in marginal Tory seats.   Had they succeeded, White and Hanson may have acquired some of ICI's respectability with which to veneer their own wheeler-dealer reputation. On guard, ICI caused White and Hanson deep embarrassment when it revealed that White was not on Hanson's board and had spent and lost several million pounds of company money on his passionate interest in racehorses.<ref name=\"BBC News\">[[BBC]] News</ref>  ICI also showed that White and Hanson ran a string of offshore companies in tax havens.   Furthermore, Hanson's son Robert, having been identified as the pair's likely successor, had been put in charge of the bid and had been shown to be na\u00efve, dealing a severe blow to White and Hanson's succession plans.   Their reputations now seriously damaged, White and Hanson had to withdraw before a formal takeover for ICI could be launched.\n\nAt the time of White's death in 1995, the climate in which the Hanson group operated had changed as investors looked beyond the conglomerate to single-sector companies.

He died in [[Los Angeles]] aged 72, leaving most of his \u00a370m fortune to his son Lucas.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/richlist/person/0,,38845,00.html/ ''Sunday Times'' Rich List]</ref>\n\n==Early life ==\nWhite attended De Aston School in [[Market Rasen]], [[Lincolnshire]].  He was a [[Royal Air Force]] pilot during [[World War II]] in clandestine operations in [[India]], [[Burma]] and [[Thailand]]. It was during the war that White became friends with Bill Hanson, British show-jumping star and younger brother of [[James Hanson, Baron Hanson|James Hanson]].\n\nTemperamentally and perhaps because of his wartime experiences, after the war White was more interested in having fun than working.  Possessed of considerable panache, he set himself up as a Hollywood impresario in the early 1950s. He was a governor of the [[British Film Institute]], 1982-4.\n\nBill Hanson died aged 27 of cancer, leaving his bereaved elder brother James with the duty of carrying on the Hanson business name.  White became a surrogate brother to James, and was eventually the brains of the Hanson takeover machine.<ref>Obituary: Lord Hanson - Wheeler-dealer who rose to greater fortune in the Thatcher years; Roger Cowe; Wednesday November 3, 2004; Guardian; referred to below as ''Lord Hanson obituary''</ref>\n\n==Early career ==\nIn 1958 in one of their first business ventures together he and [[James Hanson, Baron Hanson|James Hanson]] hit on the idea of importing jokey American greetings cards, then largely unknown in Britain.  The business trading as Hanson White became one of Britain's largest suppliers of greeting cards, giftwrap and giftware and was sold to a management buy-out for \u00a310.8m in 1997.\n\nThe pair's entry into serious business, and the world of takeovers, came through White's connection to [[Jim Slater (accountant)|Jim Slater]], the accountant turned stock market whizz kid who introduced them to the potential in public company shares.  White and Hanson concentrated on emulating Slater's takeover techniques, building up a public company through acquisitions and disposals.<ref name=\"Lord Hanson obituary\">''Lord Hanson obituary''</ref>\n\nBy 1964 he and Hanson had started to build up Hanson Trust out of the former Wiles Group.  [[Hanson plc]] turned into one of the largest [[United Kingdom|British]]-owned conglomerates with annual profits of more than \u00a31.5 billion and a strategy of growth through acquisition.  From 1965-73 White was deputy chairman of Hanson Trust Ltd.\n\n==Personal life ==\nIn 1973 White left Britain for [[New York City]] where he developed Hanson's [[United States|American]] holdings.\n\nHe married three times. His first marriage, to Elisabeth Kalen, the daughter of a Swedish diplomat, produced daughters Sita and Carolina,<ref>https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/the-tragedy-of-sita-heiress-entangled-in-a-murky-business-51729.html</ref> and the second, to an American actress, [[Virginia North]] (whom he divorced in 1991), gave him a son, Lucas. After the divorce he lived with a former model, Victoria Tucker, 40 years his junior. The couple married in a registry office in Hamilton, Bermuda, in 1992.<ref>Obituary: Lord White of Hull, [[The Independent]]_25 August 1995 . . https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-lord-white-of-hull-1597826.html</ref>\n\nHe remained chairman of Hanson Industries [[North America]], [[Iselin, New Jersey]] from 1973 until his death.\n\n<blockquote>Perhaps the most successful British buccaneer in America is the canny, soft- spoken Sir Gordon White, 64, chairman of Hanson Industries, the U.S. investing arm of London's Hanson Trust conglomerate. Hanson employs more than 35,000 workers in the eight U.S. firms it has acquired since 1973. Among the prizes: SCM, manufacturer of Smith-Corona typewriters, and Endicott Johnson, the shoe retailer. White's current target is Kidde, a maker of products ranging from Farberware kitchen utensils to Jacuzzi Whirlpool Baths. Hanson has made an offer for Kidde, and a successful deal would double the firm's U.S. employment roster. So far White has spent $2 billion on his acquisitions.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,147563,00.html/ Time Magazine]</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Business ventures ==\nUnlike Slater, White and Hanson survived the British slump in the early 1970s, but the \"quantum leap\" which had been promised to shareholders did not come until 1979, the beginning of the [[Margaret Thatcher]] era, which saw a move toward capitalism and a new respect for businessmen such as White and Hanson, who were not afraid to take on trade unions and break up established companies in pursuit of profit.<ref name=\"Lord Hanson obituary\"/>  In the 1970s and 80s White and Hanson turned the Hanson group into a multinational encompassing, amongst others, US chemical factories, UK electricity suppliers and Australian gold mines.

In 1963 he was appointed curate assistant at [[Bangor, County Down|Bangor]] Parish Church, becoming [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|Rector]] of St Dorothea's in Belfast three years later. \n\nIn the same year, 1966, he married Christine Daly. During his time in St Dorothea's, in the Braniel and Tullycarnet area of east Belfast, he developed a \"coffee bar ministry\" among young people but [[The Troubles]] interrupted. During this time he rescued a Catholic girl from a [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] mob who had set her family home on fire.  He turned down the opportunity to become dean of [[Cork (city)|Cork]] and in 1974 was appointed rector of St Mark's in Dundela in east [[Belfast]], formerly [[C. S.

In 1986, he became the 14th Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland since the Church of Ireland's break with Rome.\n\nIn 1990, some members of the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland felt offended when Eames did not attend the funeral of his neighbour and fellow Armagh primate, [[Tom\u00e1s \u00d3 Fiaich]].

This decision was made by the Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and not the Northern Ireland parades commission who did not have authority at this time and were an advisory body only. It was also outwith the remit of the police to forbid worship in the church. The ensuing public unrest and violence escalated and over the next three to four summers the situation in Northern Ireland was very unstable with other parades coming under first police and later commission sanction.\n\nThere was great unease in the Church of Ireland as it is a broad church in theology and politics and has within its congregations nationalists in the south and unionists in the north and many Orangemen holding office in local parishes. This is not an easy governance and Eames, along with the rector of Drumcree, was damned if he did and damned if he didn't. However it is the perception of many that he did nothing at all. Some bishops in the Republic of Ireland called for Eames to close the parish church. Notable among these was Bishop [[John Neill]] who later became [[Archbishop of Dublin (Church of Ireland)|Archbishop of Dublin]].\n\nEames refused to do so, believing this action could have precipitated greater unrest and possibly bloodshed. Eames described the Drumcree controversy as his \"own personal Calvary\".  After years of annual unrest in the days leading up to and following \"Drumcree Sunday\" (the Sunday before 12 July, when Orangemen marched to the church), the dispute continues but the public unrest has decreased by a massive degree, although July and August remain the most dangerous months of the year in Northern Ireland.\n\n==Anglicanism's \"troubleshooter\"==\n* Chairman of the Archbishop of Canterbury's Commission on \"Communion and Women in the Episcopate\", 1988\u201389.\n* Chairman of the Inter-Anglican Theological and Doctrinal Commission, 1991.\n* Chairman of the Lambeth Commission on Communion, 2003\u20132004.\n\n==Windsor Report==\n{{Further|Windsor Report}}\n{{unsourced|section|date=July 2017}}\nEames is also a significant figure within the general [[Anglican Communion]]. In 2003, the self-styled 'divine optimist' was appointed Chairman of the Lambeth Commission on Communion, which examined significant challenges to unity in the [[Anglican Communion]].

Church law permitted him to continue as primate until the age of 75 but he resigned, in good health, at the age of 69. On 10 January 2007, the 11 serving bishops of the Church of Ireland, meeting at St Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin, elected [[Alan Harper (archbishop)|Alan Harper]], Bishop of Connor, as Eames's successor.\n\n==Consultative Group on the Past in Northern Ireland==\n{{unsourced|section|date=July 2017}}\nIn mid 2007 he was appointed co-chairman, along with [[Denis Bradley]], of the [[Consultative Group on the Past]] in Northern Ireland. This aimed to work out how to deal with the legacy of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, especially as it affects the victims of [[the Troubles]] and their relatives. This is a very thorny subject, as \"One man's freedom fighter is another man's terrorist\".\n\nSources close to the Group created controversy in early 2008 by suggesting that the Troubles could be officially classified as a \"war\". Relatives of security force victims argued that this would demean the sacrifice of their relatives during the darkest days of the Troubles. Their relatives were often shot when off duty and unable to defend themselves; their opponents were not obeying the rules of war as commonly understood. The Group issued its report in January 2009.\n\n==Honours and awards==\n* Select preacher at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]], 1987.\n* Created a [[life peer]], he was gazetted as '''Baron Eames''', of [[Armagh]] in the [[County of Armagh]], on 25 August 1995 (on the recommendation of the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[John Major]], MP).<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=54143|date=31 August 1995|page=11867}}</ref> He sits as a [[crossbencher]].\n* honorary doctorates: Doctor of Laws degree (LL.D.), ''honoris causa'' by The Queen's University of Belfast, 1989; Doctor of Laws degree (LL.D.) honoris causa by Trinity College, Dublin, 1992; Doctor of Letters degree ([[D.Litt.]]) honoris causa by Greenwich University of Cambridge, 1994; Doctor of Divinity degree (D.D.) honoris causa by University of Cambridge, 1994; Doctor of Laws degree (LL.D.) honoris causa by Lancaster University, 1994; Doctor of Divinity degree (D.D.) honoris causa by Aberdeen University, 1997; Doctor of Divinity degree (D.D.) honoris causa by Exeter University, 1999; Doctor of Laws degree (LL.D.) honoris causa by University of Ulster, 2002.

The Commission published its report (\"the [[Windsor Report]]\") on 18 October 2004.\n\n==Retirement and succession==\n{{unsourced|section|date=July 2017}}\nAt the Church of Ireland General Synod in 2006 he announced his intention to retire on 31 December 2006.  Church law permitted him to continue as primate until the age of 75 but he resigned, in good health, at the age of 69. On 10 January 2007, the 11 serving bishops of the Church of Ireland, meeting at St Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin, elected [[Alan Harper (archbishop)|Alan Harper]], Bishop of Connor, as Eames's successor.\n\n==Consultative Group on the Past in Northern Ireland==\n{{unsourced|section|date=July 2017}}\nIn mid 2007 he was appointed co-chairman, along with [[Denis Bradley]], of the [[Consultative Group on the Past]] in Northern Ireland. This aimed to work out how to deal with the legacy of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, especially as it affects the victims of [[the Troubles]] and their relatives. This is a very thorny subject, as \"One man's freedom fighter is another man's terrorist\".\n\nSources close to the Group created controversy in early 2008 by suggesting that the Troubles could be officially classified as a \"war\". Relatives of security force victims argued that this would demean the sacrifice of their relatives during the darkest days of the Troubles. Their relatives were often shot when off duty and unable to defend themselves; their opponents were not obeying the rules of war as commonly understood. The Group issued its report in January 2009.\n\n==Honours and awards==\n* Select preacher at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]], 1987.\n* Created a [[life peer]], he was gazetted as '''Baron Eames''', of [[Armagh]] in the [[County of Armagh]], on 25 August 1995 (on the recommendation of the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[John Major]], MP).<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=54143|date=31 August 1995|page=11867}}</ref> He sits as a [[crossbencher]].\n* honorary doctorates: Doctor of Laws degree (LL.D.), ''honoris causa'' by The Queen's University of Belfast, 1989; Doctor of Laws degree (LL.D.) honoris causa by Trinity College, Dublin, 1992; Doctor of Letters degree ([[D.Litt.]]) honoris causa by Greenwich University of Cambridge, 1994; Doctor of Divinity degree (D.D.) honoris causa by University of Cambridge, 1994; Doctor of Laws degree (LL.D.) honoris causa by Lancaster University, 1994; Doctor of Divinity degree (D.D.) honoris causa by Aberdeen University, 1997; Doctor of Divinity degree (D.D.) honoris causa by Exeter University, 1999; Doctor of Laws degree (LL.D.) honoris causa by University of Ulster, 2002.

The Award was presented by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, on 16 November 2006, at a special service in St Patrick's Cathedral, Armagh. Presenting the award, Archbishop Williams said: \u201cWe have in the Anglican Communion various ways of recognising distinguished service. There are awards given at Lambeth, there is the Cross of St Augustine. But once in a while somebody comes along for whom this doesn't seem completely adequate and when Desmond Tutu retired, the then Archbishop of Canterbury invented the Archbishop of Canterbury's Award for Outstanding Service to the Anglican Communion. Tonight it is a huge privilege to present that award for the second time.\u201d{{cn|date=July 2017}}\n* [[Tipperary International Peace Award]], 2006 (to be presented in April 2007 at the Tipperary International Festival).\n* In 2007, he received the [[Order of Merit]] from [[Elizabeth II]], this is an exclusive order, restricted to 24 members, who receive it in the personal gift of the Queen, and entitled recipients to the [[postnominals]] 'OM' after their name.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=58379|date=29 June 2007|page=9395}}</ref>\n* Given the Freedom of the City of [[Armagh]] in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ireland.anglican.org/news/791|title=Church of Ireland - A Member of the Anglican Communion|website=Ireland.anglican.org|accessdate=12 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{Infobox COA wide\n|image = [[File:Coronet of a British Baron.svg|centre|150px]][[File:Eames Escutcheon.png|centre|200px]]\n|escutcheon = Azure on a fess embattled counterembattled Or between three Celtic crosses each dimidated with a shamrock Or a barrulet Azure.\n|crest = Within a circlet of shamrocks Or a mitre with infulae Proper.\n|supporters = Dexter, a stag per fess Sable and Vert attired and unguled Or gorged with a riband tied Purpure semy of shamrocks Pr; sinister, a stag per fess Vert and Sable attired unguled and gorged with a like riband. <ref>{{cite book|title=Debrett's Peerage |date=2000}}</ref>}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Life Peerages]]\n* [[List of Northern Ireland Members of the House of Lords]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Alf McCreary, [https://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0340862238/ ''Nobody's Fool''] (biography of Robin Eames)\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.cgpni.org Consultative Group on the Past]\n{{S-start}}\n{{s-rel|ie}}\n{{succession box\n  | title = [[Bishop of Derry and Raphoe]]\n  | years = 1975\u20131980\n  | before = [[Cuthbert Peacocke]]\n  | after =  [[James Mehaffey]]\n}}\n{{succession box\n  | title = [[Bishop of Down and Dromore]]\n  | years = 1980\u20131986\n  | before = [[George Quin]]\n  | after = [[Gordon McMullan]]\n}}\n{{succession box\n  | title = [[Archbishop of Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Archbishop of Armagh]]\n  | years = 1986\u20132006\n  | before = [[John Armstrong (archbishop of Armagh)|John Armstrong]]\n  | after = [[Alan Harper (bishop)|Alan Harper]]\n}}\n{{S-end}}\n{{Bishops of Derry and Raphoe}}\n{{Bishops of Down and Dromore}}\n{{Anglican archbishops of Armagh}}\n\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Eames, Robin}}\n[[Category:1936 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Anglican priests from Northern Ireland]]\n[[Category:Crossbench life peers]]\n[[Category:Religious leaders from Belfast]]\n[[Category:Alumni of Queen's University Belfast]]\n[[Category:Ordained peers]]\n[[Category:20th-century Anglican archbishops]]\n[[Category:21st-century Anglican archbishops]]\n[[Category:Anglican archbishops of Armagh]]\n[[Category:Members of the Order of Merit]]\n[[Category:People educated at the Belfast Royal Academy]]\n[[Category:Bishops of Down and Dromore]]\n[[Category:Bishops of Derry and Raphoe]]\n[[Category:People educated at Methodist College Belfast]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eMinistry in Ireland:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Eames"}
