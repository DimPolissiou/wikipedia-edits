It became active in the 1910s after the release of ''[[The Fundamentals]]'', a twelve-volume set of essays, [[Christian apologetics|apologetic]] and [[polemic]], written by conservative Protestant theologians to defend what they saw as Protestant [[orthodoxy]]. The movement became more organized within U.S. Protestant churches in the 1920s, especially with [[Baptists]] and [[Presbyterians]].\n\nMany churches which embraced fundamentalism adopted a militant attitude with regard to their core beliefs and combined [[Princeton theology]] with [[Dispensationalism]].<ref name=\"Marsden 1980, pp. 55-62, 118-23\" /> Since 1930, many fundamentalist churches have been represented by the [[Independent Fundamental Churches of America]] (renamed IFCA International in 1996), which holds to biblical inerrancy.\n\n== Terminology ==\nThe term ''[[fundamentalism]]'' was coined by [[Baptists|Baptist]] editor Curtis Lee Laws in 1920 to designate Protestants who were ready \"to do battle royal for the fundamentals\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.itib.org/articles/contending_for_the_faith/contending_for_the_faith_1-1.html|title=ITIB \u2013 Contending for the Faith, Chapter 1|website=www.itib.org|access-date=9 December 2016}}</ref> The term was quickly adopted by all sides.

Woodberry and Christian S. Smith,\n{{Quote | Following the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], tensions developed between Northern evangelical leaders over [[Darwinism]] and higher [[biblical criticism]]; Southerners remained unified in their opposition to both (Marsden 1980, 1991). Modernists attempted to update [[Christianity]] to match their view of science. They denied biblical miracles and argued that God manifests himself through the social evolution of society. Conservatives resisted these changes. These latent tensions rose to the surface after [[World War I]] in what came to be called the [[Fundamentalist\u2013Modernist controversy|fundamentalist/modernist split]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last1 =Woodberry|first1 =Robert D |last2= Smith |first2=Christian S.|year=1998|title=Fundamentalism et al: conservative Protestants in America |journal=Annual Review of Sociology |volume= 24|issue =1 |pages =25\u201356|via=AcademicOne File |doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.24.1.25}}</ref>}}\n\nHowever, the split does not mean that there were just two groups, modernists and fundamentalists. There were also people who considered themselves neo-evangelicals, separating themselves from the extreme components of fundamentalism. These neo-evangelicals also wanted to separate themselves from both the fundamentalist movement and the mainstream evangelical movement due to their anti-intellectual approaches.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Evangelicalism ===\nThe first important stream was [[Evangelicalism]] which emerged in the [[Christian revival|revivals]] of the [[First Great Awakening|First]] and [[Second Great Awakening]]s in America and the [[Methodism|Methodist]] movement in England in the period from 1730\u20131840. They in turn were influenced by the [[Pietism|Pietist]] movement in Germany. Church historian [[Randall Balmer]] explains that:\n{{quote|Evangelicalism itself, I believe, is a quintessentially North American phenomenon, deriving as it did from the confluence of Pietism, [[Presbyterianism]], and the vestiges of [[Puritans|Puritanism]]. Evangelicalism picked up the peculiar characteristics from each strain \u2013 warmhearted spirituality from the Pietists (for instance), doctrinal precisionism from the Presbyterians, and individualistic introspection from the Puritans \u2013 even as the North American context itself has profoundly shaped the various manifestations of evangelicalism: fundamentalism, neo-evangelicalism, the [[holiness movement]], [[Pentecostalism]], the [[charismatic movement]], and various forms of African-American and Hispanic evangelicalism.<ref>{{cite book|author=Randall Balmer|title=The Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=syUupeVJOz4C&pg=PR8|year=2002|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|pages=vii\u2013viii|isbn=978-0-664-22409-7}}</ref>}}\n\n=== Dispensationalism ===\nA second stream was [[Dispensationalism]], a new interpretation of the Bible developed in the 1830s in England. [[John Nelson Darby]]'s ideas were disseminated by the notes and commentaries in the widely used [[Scofield Reference Bible]], published in 1909. Dispensationalism was a [[Millennialism|millenarian theory]] that divided all of time into seven different stages, called \"dispensations\", which were seen as stages of [[God in Christianity|God]]'s [[revelation]]. At the end of each stage, according to this theory, God [[divine retribution|punished]] the particular peoples who were involved in each dispensation for their failure to fulfill the requirements which they were under during its duration. Increasing [[secularism]], [[liberalism]], and [[immorality]] in the 1920s were believed to be signs that humanity had again failed God's test. Dispensationalists held to a form of [[eschatology]] which advocated the belief that the world was on the verge of the last stage, known as the [[Great Tribulation]] in which a final battle will take place at [[Armageddon]] (the valley of [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]]), followed by [[Second Coming of Christ|Christ's return]], his [[Millennialism|1,000-year reign]] on earth, a final rebellion and then a final judgment, after which all mankind, devils and angels will be divided into either [[Heaven]] or the [[Lake of Fire]].<ref name=\"Kee 1998 484\">{{cite book|last=Kee|first=Howard Clark|title=Christianity: A Social and Cultural History|year=1998|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|isbn=0-13-578071-3|pages=484|author2=Emily Albu |author3=Carter Lindberg |author4=J.

Militant opposition to modernism was what most clearly set off fundamentalism.\"<ref>Marsden (1980), ''Fundamentalism and American Culture'' p. 4</ref> Others viewing militancy as a core characteristic of the fundamentalist movement include Philip Melling, Ung Kyu Pak and Ronald Witherup.<ref>Philip H. Melling, Fundamentalism in America: millennialism, identity and militant religion (1999).

At a large conference in Philadelphia in 1919, Riley founded the [[World Christian Fundamentals Association]] (WCFA), which became the chief interdenominational fundamentalist organization in the 1920s.

[[William Bell Riley]] took the initiative in the 1925 [[Scopes Trial]] by bringing in famed politician [[William Jennings Bryan]] and hiring him to serve as an assistant to the local prosecutor, who helped draw national media attention to the trial. In the half century after the Scopes Trial, fundamentalists had little success in shaping government policy, and they were generally defeated in their efforts to reshape the [[Mainline Protestant|mainline denominations]], which refused to join fundamentalist attacks on evolution.<ref name=\"Kee 1998 484\" /> Particularly after the Scopes Trial, liberals saw a division between Christians in favor of the teaching of evolution, whom they viewed as educated and tolerant, and Christians against evolution, whom they viewed as narrow-minded, tribal, obscurantist.<ref>David Goetz, \"The Monkey Trial\".

Rather, he argues, the cause of fundamentalism's retreat was the death of its leader, Bryan. Most fundamentalists saw the trial as a victory rather than a defeat, but Bryan's death soon afterward created a leadership void that no other fundamentalist leader could fill. Unlike the other fundamentalist leaders, Bryan brought name recognition, respectability, and the ability to forge a broad-based coalition of fundamentalist religious groups to argue in favor of the anti-evolutionist position.<ref>Mark Edwards, \"Rethinking the Failure of Fundamentalist Political Antievolutionism after 1925\".

Despite some similarities between these two causes, the creation science movement represented a shift from religious to scientific objections to Darwin's theory. Creation science also differed in terms of popular leadership, rhetorical tone, and sectional focus. It lacked a prestigious leader like Bryan, utilized scientific rather than religious rhetoric, and was a product of California and Michigan rather than the South.<ref>Willard B. Gatewood, Jr., ed. ''Controversy in the Twenties: Fundamentalism, Modernism, & Evolution'' (1969)</ref>\n\nWebb (1991) traces the political and legal struggles between strict creationists and Darwinists to influence the extent to which evolution would be taught as science in Arizona and California schools. After Scopes was convicted, creationists throughout the United States sought similar antievolution laws for their states. These included Reverends R. S. Beal and Aubrey L. Moore in Arizona and members of the Creation Research Society in California, all supported by distinguished laymen. They sought to ban evolution as a topic for study, or at least relegate it to the status of unproven theory perhaps taught alongside the biblical version of creation. Educators, scientists, and other distinguished laymen favored evolution. This struggle occurred later in the Southwest than in other US areas and persisted through the Sputnik era.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Webb | first1 = George E. | year = 1991 | title = The Evolution Controversy in Arizona and California: From the 1920s to the 1980s | url = | journal = Journal of the Southwest | volume = 33 | issue = 2| pages = 133\u2013150 }} See also {{cite journal | last1 = Curtis | first1 = Christopher K. | year = 1986 | title = Mississippi's Anti-Evolution Law of 1926 | url = | journal = Journal of Mississippi History | volume = 48 | issue = 1| pages = 15\u201329 }}</ref>\n\nIn recent times, the courts have heard cases on whether or not the Book of Genesis's creation account should be taught in science classrooms alongside evolution, most notably in the 2005 federal court case ''[[Kitzmiller v.

The counter marginal trend, represented most notably by the infamous [[Logos Foundation (Australia)|Logos Foundation]], led by [[Howard Carter (evangelist)|Howard Carter]] in [[Toowoomba]], [[Queensland]], and later by 'manifest glory' movements such as [[Bethel Church, Redding]]<ref>https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2016/may/cover-story-inside-popular-controversial-bethel-church.html |title=Riches and Wagner (eds), Cover Story: Inside the Popular, Controversial Bethel Church.</ref> can be found in congregations such as the Range Christian Fellowship.\n\nThe ''Logos Foundation'' was an influential and controversial [[Christianity|Christian]] ministry that flourished in [[Australia]] in the 1970s and 1980s, under the leadership of [[Howard Carter (Evangelist)|Howard Carter]], originally a Baptist pastor from Auckland, New Zealand. Logos Foundation was initially a trans-denominational charismatic teaching ministry, and its members were primarily [[Protestantism|Protestant]] but it also had some ties with [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] lay groups and individuals.<ref name=\"espace.library.uq.edu.au\">https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:8027/HARRISON_eprint_.pdf</ref>\n\nLogos Foundation was [[Christian Reconstructionism|Reconstructionist]], [[Restorationism|Restorationist]], and [[Dominionism|Dominionist]] in its theology and works.\nIt was established c.1966 by Paul Collins in [[New Zealand]] as a trans-denominational teaching ministry which served the [[Charismatic Renewal]] by publishing the Logos Magazine. Paul Collins moved it to [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], c.1969, where it also facilitated large trans-denominational renewal conferences in venues such as Sydney Town Hall and the Wentworth Hotel. It was transferred to Howard Carter's leadership, relocating to Hazelbrook, lower Blue Mountains of New South Wales, where it operated for a few years, and in the mid-1970s, it was transferred to Blackheath, upper Blue Mountains. During these years the teaching ministry attracted like-minded fellowships and home groups into a loose association with it.\n\nPublishing became a significant operation, distributing charismatic themed and Restorationist teachings focused on Christian maturity and Christ's pre-eminence in short books and the monthly Logos/Restore Magazine (associated with New Wine Magazine, US). It held annual weeklong conferences of over 1,000 registrants, featuring international charismatic speakers, including [[Derek Prince]], [[Ern Baxter]], [[Don Basham]], [[Charlie Simpson (pastor)|Charles Simpson]], Bob Mumford, [[Kevin Conner]] (Australia), Peter Morrow (New Zealand) and others.\n\nA Bible College was also established nearby at Westwood Lodge, Mount Victoria. At the main site in Blackheath a Christian K-12 school, [[Mountains Christian Academy]] was established which was a forerunner of more widespread Christian independent schools and home schooling as a hallmark of the movement. It carried over the [[Old Covenant]] practice of tithing (to the local church), and expected regular sacrificial giving beyond this.\n\nTheologically it taught orthodox Christian core beliefs \u2013 however in matters of opinion Logos teaching was presented as authoritative and alternative views were discouraged. Those who questioned this teaching eventually tended to leave the movement. Over time, a strong [[cult]]-like culture of group conformity developed and those who dared to question it were quickly brought into line by other members who gave automated responses which were shrouded in spiritualised expressions. In some instances the leadership enforced unquestioning compliance by engaging in [[bullying]]-type behavior. The group viewed itself as being separate from 'the world' and it even regarded alternative views and other expressions, denominations or interpretations of Christianity with distrust at worst but considered most of them false at best.\n\nFrom the mid-1970s a hierarchical ecclesiology was adopted in the form of the [[Shepherding Movement]]'s whole-of-life discipleship of members by personal pastors (usually their \"cell group\" leaders), who in turn were also accountable to their personal pastors. Followers were informed that even their leader, Howard Carter, related as a disciple to the apostolic group in Christian Growth Ministries of Bob Mumford, Charles Simpson, Ern Baxter, Derek Prince, and Don Basham, in Ft Lauderdale, US (whose network was estimated to have approx. 150,000 people involved at its peak c.1985). Howard Carter's primary pastoral relationship was with [[Ern Baxter]], a pioneer of the [[Healing Revival]] of the 1950s and the [[Charismatic Renewal]] of the 1960s, 70s, and 80s. Written covenants of submission to the individual church pastors were encouraged for the members of one representative church, Christian Faith Centre (Sydney), and were said to be common practice throughout the movement at the time.\n\nIn 1980 the Logos movement churches adopted the name, Australian Fellowship of Covenant Communities (AFoCC), and were led through an eschatological shift in the early 1980s from the pre-millennialism of many Pentecostals (described as a theology of defeat), to the post-millennialism of the Presbyterian Reconstructionist theonomists (described as a theology of victory). A shift to an overt theological-political paradigm resulted in some senior leadership, including Pastor David Jackson of Christian Faith Centre Sydney, leaving the movement altogether. In the mid-1980s AFoCC re-branded yet again as the Covenant Evangelical Church (not associated with the Evangelical Covenant Church in the US). The Logos Foundation brand name continued as the educational, commercial and political arm of the [[Covenant Evangelical Church]].\n\nIt moved for the final time in 1986 to [[Toowoomba]], [[Queensland]] where there were already associated fellowships and a demographic environment highly conducive to the growth of extreme right-wing religio-political movements. This fertile ground saw the movement peak in a short time, reaching a local support base of upwards of 2000 people.<ref name=\"www120.secure.griffith.edu.au\">https://www120.secure.griffith.edu.au/rch/file/cb4cc218-5145-a604-f5ec-180d9177971d/1/Hey_2011_02Thesis.pdf</ref>\n\nThe move to [[Toowoomba]] involved much preparation, including members selling homes and other assets in [[New South Wales]] and the Logos Foundation acquiring many homes, businesses and commercial properties in Toowoomba and the [[Darling Downs]].\n\nIn the process of relocating the organisation and most of its members, it absorbed a number of other small Christian churches in Toowoomba. Some of these were house churches/groups more or less affiliated with Carter's other organisations. Carter and some of his followers attempted to make links with Queensland Premier Johannes Bjelke-Petersen, a known Christian conservative, in order to further their goals.\n\nCarter continued to lead the shift in eschatology to post-millennialism and prominently religio-political in nature. More of his leadership team left the movement as Carter's style became more [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and [[cult]]ish. Colin Shaw who was a key member at this time, believed that Pastor Howard Carter was an \"anointed man of God\" and Shaw later became the \"right-hand\" man of Carter in his \"outreach and missionary works\" in Quezon City, Philippines. Logos used this Filipino church, the Christian Renewal Center (a moderate Pentecostal/Charismatic church) as their base to advance and promote the teachings of the Shepherding Movement. With local assistance in the Philippines, Colin Shaw coordinated and sponsored under the Christian Renewal Centre's name, conferences featuring Carter. Many poorly educated and sincere Filipino pastors and locals, usually from small churches, were convinced to support the wider Logos movement with tithes that were collected from their limited funds. However, soon after the revelations of Howard Carter's scandalous immorality and corrupt lifestyle broke, the Filipino wing of Logos dissolved and its former members dispersed back into established local churches. Colin Shaw was said to have abandoned the Shepherding movement at this time and for a time after that, he engaged in soul searching and self exile, fueled by severe guilt over the way these Filipino Christians were manipulated.\n\nIn 1989 Logos controversially involved itself in the [[Queensland]] State election, running a campaign of surveys and full-page newspaper advertisements promoting the line that candidates' adherence to Christian principles and biblical ethics was more important than the widespread corruption in the Queensland government that had been revealed by the [[Fitzgerald Inquiry]]. Published advertisements in the Courier-Mail at the time promoted strongly conservative positions in opposition to pornography, homosexuality and abortion, and a return to the death penalty. Some supporters controversially advocated Old Testament laws and penalties.<ref>Sydney Morning Herald, 13 October 1990, \"Sex Scandal \u2013 Bible Belt\", p.74</ref> This action backfired sensationally, with many mainstream Churches, community leaders and religious organisations distancing themselves from the Logos Foundation after making public statements denouncing it.<ref name=\"espace.library.uq.edu.au\" /> At times the death penalty for homosexuals was advocated, in accordance with Old Testament Law.<ref>https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:8027/HARRISON_eprint_.pdf, p.3</ref><ref>\"Sex Scandal \u2013 Bible Belt\", Sydney Morning Herald, 13 October 1990, p.74</ref> The Sydney Morning Herald later described part of this campaign when the Logos Foundation published, \"Homosexuality and censorship should determine your vote, the electorate was told; corruption was not the major concern.\"<ref>Roberts, G., Sex Scandal Divides Bible Belt, Sydney Morning Herald, 12 October 1990</ref> The same article quoted Carter from a letter he had written to supporters at the time, \"The greenies, the gays and the greedy are marching. Now the Christians, the conservatives and the concerned must march also\". These views were not new. An earlier article published in the Herald quoted a Logos spokesman in reference to the call for the death penalty for homosexuals in order to rid Queensland of such people, who stated \"the fact a law is on the statutes is the best safeguard for society\".<ref>Lyons, J., God Remains an Issue in Queensland, Sydney Morning Herald, 18 November 1989</ref>\n\nAlthough similar behaviours existed previously, these last years in Queensland saw Logos Foundation develop cult-like tendencies. This authoritarian environment degenerated into a perverse and unbiblical abuse of power. Obedience and unhealthy submission to human leaders was cultish in many ways and the concept of submission for the purpose of 'spiritual covering' became a dominant theme in its teaching. The idea of spiritual covering soon degenerated into a system of overt abuse of power and excessive control of people's lives. This occurred despite growing opposition to the [[Shepherding Movement|Shepherding movement]] from respected [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] and Pentecostal leaders in the United States beginning as early as 1975. However, in Australia, through the Logos Foundation and Covenant Evangelical Church, this movement flourished beyond the time when it had effectively entered a period of decline in North America. Followers in Australia, were effectively quarantined by Carter from the truth of what had begun to play out in the U.S.A.\n\nThe movement had ties to a number of other groups including World MAP (Ralph Mahoney), [[California]]; Christian Growth Ministries, [[Fort Lauderdale]]; and [[R. J. Rushdoony|Rousas Rushdoony]], the father of [[Christian Reconstructionism]] in the [[United States]]. Activities included printing, publishing, conferencing, home schooling and ministry training. Logos Foundation (Australia) and these other organizations at times issued theological qualifications and other apparently academic degrees, master's degrees and doctorates following no formal process of study or recognized rigour, often under a range of dubious names that included the word \"University\". Carter conferred on himself a Master of Arts degree in 1987 which was apparently issued by the ''Pacific College Theological'',{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} an institution whose existence has been unable to be verified when investigated by journalists. Visiting preachers from the United States were frequently gifted such 'qualifications' by Carter including a PhD purportedly issued by the ''University of Oceania Sancto Spiritus''. The recipient thereafter used the title of ''Doctor'' in his itinerant preaching and revival ministry throughout North America.\n\nThe Shepherding movement worldwide descended into a cultish movement characterized by manipulative relationships, abuse of power and dubious financial arrangements. It had been an attempt by mostly sincere people, to free Christianity of the entrenched reductions of traditional and consumerist religion. However, with its emphasis on authority and submissive accountability, the movement was open to abuse. This, combined with spiritual hunger, an early measure of success and growth, mixed motives, and the inexperience of new leaders all coalesced to form a dangerous and volatile mix. Howard Carter played these factors skillfully to entrench his own position.\n\nThe Logos Foundation and Covenant Evangelical Church did not survive long the scandal of Howard Carter's standing down and public exposure of adultery in 1990. Hey (2010) has stated in his thesis, \"Suggested reasons for Carter's failure have included insecurity, an inability to open up to others, arrogance and over confidence in his own ability\".<ref name=\"www120.secure.griffith.edu.au\" /> Like many modern evangelists and mega-church leaders, he was placed on a pedestal by the movement's followers. This environment where the leader was not subject to true accountability, allowed his deception and double life to flourish unknown for many years. In the years immediately prior to this scandal, those who dared to question were quickly derided by other members or even disciplined, thus reinforcing a very unhealthy environment. When the scandal of Carter's immorality was revealed, full details of the lavish lifestyle to which he had become accustomed were also exposed. Carter's frequent travel to North America was lavish and extravagant, utilizing first class flights and five-star hotels. The full financial affairs of the organization prior to the collapse were highly secretive. Most members had been unaware of how vast sums of money involved in the whole operation were being channelled nor were they aware of how the leaders' access to these funds was being managed.\n\nA significant number of quite senior ex-Logos members found acceptance in the now-defunct Rangeville Uniting Church. The congregation of the Rangeville Uniting Church left the Uniting Church to become an independent congregation known as the Rangeville Community Church. Prior to the Rangeville Uniting Church closing an earlier split resulted in a significant percentage of the total congregation contributing to the formation of the Range Christian Fellowship in Blake Street Toowoomba.\n\nThe Range Christian Fellowship in Blake Street Toowoomba, is known for exuberant worship services and the public manifestation of charismatic phenomena and manifestations that place it well outside of mainstream Pentecostal church expression. It is possibly one of the prime Australian examples of churches which are associated with the [[New Apostolic Reformation]], a fundamentalist Pentecostal [[Christian right|religious right]] wing movement which has been described by American journalist Forrest Wilder as follows, \"Their beliefs can tend toward the bizarre. Some prophets even claim to have seen demons at public meetings. They've taken biblical literalism to an extreme\".<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.texasobserver.org/rick-perrys-army-of-god/ | title=Rick Perry's Army of God| date=3 August 2011}}</ref> It operates in a converted squash centre<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hart|first1=Timothy|title=Church Discover|url=http://www.geocities.ws/discoverchurch/r.htm|accessdate=10 September 2016}}</ref> and it was established on 9 November 1997<ref>{{harvnb|Small|2004|page=293}}</ref> as a group which broke away from the Rangeville [[Uniting Church in Australia|Uniting Church]] in [[Toowoomba]] over disagreements with the national leadership of the [[Uniting Church in Australia]]. These disagreements were predominantly around the [[Ordination of LGBT Christian clergy|ordination of homosexual people]] into ministry.<ref>{{harvnb|Small|2004|page=287}}</ref> The Range Christian Fellowship's diverse origins resulted in a divergent mix of worship preferences, expectations and issues. The church initially met in a Seventh Day Adventist church hall before purchasing the property in Blake Street, leaving the congregation heavily indebted,<ref>{{harvnb|Small|2004|pages=299\u2013300}}</ref> often close to bankruptcy,<ref name=J920.72SMA>{{harvnb|Small|2004|page=358}}</ref> and with a high turnover of congregants.<ref>{{harvnb|Small|2004|page=306}}</ref> The congregation attributes their continued avoidance of financial collapse to God's blessing and regard this as a [[miracle]].<ref>{{harvnb|Small|2004|page=316}}</ref>\n\nWhilst adhering to Protestant beliefs, the church supplements these beliefs with influences from the [[New Apostolic Reformation]], [[Revivalism]], [[Dominion theology]], [[Kingdom Now theology]], [[Spiritual Warfare]] Christianity and Five-fold ministry thinking. Scripture is interpreted literally, though selectively. Unusual manifestations attributed to the [[Holy Spirit]] or the presence of 'the [[anointing]]' include women and at times even men, moaning and retching as though experiencing [[child birth]],<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.visionintlm.com/articles_view.asp?columnid=5958&articleid=66581 | title=TRAVAIL AND APOSTOLIC ORDER \u2013 Vision International Ministries}}</ref> with some claiming to be having actual [[Uterine contraction|contractions]] of the [[womb]] (known as spiritual birthing).<ref>http://www.spiritwatch.org/fireimpart.htm, 4th paragraph</ref> Dramatic and [[Apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]] predictions regarding the future were particularly evident during the time leading up to [[Y2K]], when a number of [[Prophecy|prophecies]] were publicly shared, all of which were proven false by subsequent events. Attendees are given a high degree of freedom, influenced in the church's initial years by the promotion of Jim Rutz's publication, \"The Open Church\", resulting in broad tolerance of expressions of [[revelation]], a 'word from the Lord' or [[prophecy]].\n\nAt times, people within the fellowship claim to have seen [[Vision (spirituality)|visions]] in either dreams, whilst in a [[trance]]-like state during worship, or during moments of [[religious ecstasy]], with these experiences frequently conveying a [[revelation]] or [[prophecy]]. Other occurrences have included people claiming to have been in an [[altered state of consciousness]] (referred to as 'resting in the Lord' and [[Slain in the Spirit|'slain in the spirit']] among other names), characterized by reduced external awareness and expanded interior mental and spiritual awareness, often accompanied by [[Vision (spirituality)|visions]] and emotional (and sometimes physical) [[euphoria]]. The church has hosted visits from various Christian leaders who claim to be modern day [[Apostles]] as well as many others who claim to be [[prophet]]s or [[faith healer]]s. Perhaps surprisingly, [[speaking in tongues]], which is common in other [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] churches, also occurs but it is not frequent nor is it promoted; and it is rarely witnessed in public gatherings. Neo-charismatic elements are rejected elsewhere in classical Pentecostalism, such as the [[Prayer of Jabez]], [[prosperity theology]], the [[Toronto Blessing]] (with its emphasis on strange, non-verbal expressions), George Otis' [[Spiritual Warfare]], the [[Brownsville Revival]] (Pensacola Outpouring), [[Morningstar Ministries]], the [[Lakeland Revival]], and the [[Vineyard churches|Vineyard]] group of churches, have been influential. The church has always been known for its vibrant and occasionally euphoric and ecstatic worship services, services in which music, song, dancing, flags and banners are all utilized. Range Christian Fellowship is part of the church unity movement in [[Toowoomba]], with other like-minded churches (mainstream traditional denominations have a separate [[ecumenical]] group).<ref>{{cite web|title=Christian Leaders' Network|url=https://www.facebook.com/pages/Christian-Leaders-Network-Toowoomba/199607780060750?sk=info&tab=page_info|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=17 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=One City One Church One Heart|url=http://www.onechurch.org.au/|publisher=Toowoomba Christian Leaders' Network|accessdate=17 January 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214181124/http://www.onechurch.org.au/|archivedate=14 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Christian Fellowship|first1=The Range|title=The Range Christian Fellowship|url=https://www.facebook.com/TheRangeChristianFellowship|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=17 January 2015}}</ref> This group, known as the Christian Leaders' Network, maspires to be a [[Christian right]] wing influence group within the city, at the centre of a hoped-for great [[Revivalisms|revival]] during which they will 'take the city for the Lord'.

Criticism of the church is regarded as a badge of honour by some of its members, because they view it in terms of the expected [[persecution]] of the holy remnant of the true church in the [[last days]]. The church continues to be drawn to, and associate itself with fringe Pentecostal and fundamentalist movements, particularly those which originated in [[North America]], most recently with Doug Addison's.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.facebook.com/TheRangeChristianFellowship/ | title=The Range Christian Fellowship}}</ref> Addison has become known for delivering prophecies through dreams and unconventionally through people's body tattoos, and he mixes highly fundamentalist Christianity with elements of psychic spirituality.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.letusreason.org/Popteach62.htm | title=When psychology meets psychic -}}</ref>\n\n== Anglican fundamentalism ==\n{{Main|Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral}}\n\n== Catholic fundamentalism ==\nSome scholars describe certain Catholics as fundamentalists.

It became active in the 1910s after the release of ''[[The Fundamentals]]'', a twelve-volume set of essays, [[Christian apologetics|apologetic]] and [[polemic]], written by conservative Protestant theologians to defend what they saw as Protestant [[orthodoxy]]. The movement became more organized within U.S. Protestant churches in the 1920s, especially with [[Baptists]] and [[Presbyterians]].\n\nMany churches which embraced fundamentalism adopted a militant attitude with regard to their core beliefs and combined [[Princeton theology]] with [[Dispensationalism]].<ref name=\"Marsden 1980, pp. 55-62, 118-23\" /> Since 1930, many fundamentalist churches have been represented by the [[Independent Fundamental Churches of America]] (renamed IFCA International in 1996), which holds to biblical inerrancy.\n\n== Terminology ==\nThe term ''[[fundamentalism]]'' was coined by [[Baptists|Baptist]] editor Curtis Lee Laws in 1920 to designate Protestants who were ready \"to do battle royal for the fundamentals\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.itib.org/articles/contending_for_the_faith/contending_for_the_faith_1-1.html|title=ITIB \u2013 Contending for the Faith, Chapter 1|website=www.itib.org|access-date=9 December 2016}}</ref> The term was quickly adopted by all sides.

Woodberry and Christian S. Smith,\n{{Quote | Following the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], tensions developed between Northern evangelical leaders over [[Darwinism]] and higher [[biblical criticism]]; Southerners remained unified in their opposition to both (Marsden 1980, 1991). Modernists attempted to update [[Christianity]] to match their view of science. They denied biblical miracles and argued that God manifests himself through the social evolution of society. Conservatives resisted these changes. These latent tensions rose to the surface after [[World War I]] in what came to be called the [[Fundamentalist\u2013Modernist controversy|fundamentalist/modernist split]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last1 =Woodberry|first1 =Robert D |last2= Smith |first2=Christian S.|year=1998|title=Fundamentalism et al: conservative Protestants in America |journal=Annual Review of Sociology |volume= 24|issue =1 |pages =25\u201356|via=AcademicOne File |doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.24.1.25}}</ref>}}\n\nHowever, the split does not mean that there were just two groups, modernists and fundamentalists. There were also people who considered themselves neo-evangelicals, separating themselves from the extreme components of fundamentalism. These neo-evangelicals also wanted to separate themselves from both the fundamentalist movement and the mainstream evangelical movement due to their anti-intellectual approaches.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Evangelicalism ===\nThe first important stream was [[Evangelicalism]] which emerged in the [[Christian revival|revivals]] of the [[First Great Awakening|First]] and [[Second Great Awakening]]s in America and the [[Methodism|Methodist]] movement in England in the period from 1730\u20131840. They in turn were influenced by the [[Pietism|Pietist]] movement in Germany. Church historian [[Randall Balmer]] explains that:\n{{quote|Evangelicalism itself, I believe, is a quintessentially North American phenomenon, deriving as it did from the confluence of Pietism, [[Presbyterianism]], and the vestiges of [[Puritans|Puritanism]]. Evangelicalism picked up the peculiar characteristics from each strain \u2013 warmhearted spirituality from the Pietists (for instance), doctrinal precisionism from the Presbyterians, and individualistic introspection from the Puritans \u2013 even as the North American context itself has profoundly shaped the various manifestations of evangelicalism: fundamentalism, neo-evangelicalism, the [[holiness movement]], [[Pentecostalism]], the [[charismatic movement]], and various forms of African-American and Hispanic evangelicalism.<ref>{{cite book|author=Randall Balmer|title=The Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=syUupeVJOz4C&pg=PR8|year=2002|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|pages=vii\u2013viii|isbn=978-0-664-22409-7}}</ref>}}\n\n=== Dispensationalism ===\nA second stream was [[Dispensationalism]], a new interpretation of the Bible developed in the 1830s in England. [[John Nelson Darby]]'s ideas were disseminated by the notes and commentaries in the widely used [[Scofield Reference Bible]], published in 1909. Dispensationalism was a [[Millennialism|millenarian theory]] that divided all of time into seven different stages, called \"dispensations\", which were seen as stages of [[God in Christianity|God]]'s [[revelation]]. At the end of each stage, according to this theory, God [[divine retribution|punished]] the particular peoples who were involved in each dispensation for their failure to fulfill the requirements which they were under during its duration. Increasing [[secularism]], [[liberalism]], and [[immorality]] in the 1920s were believed to be signs that humanity had again failed God's test. Dispensationalists held to a form of [[eschatology]] which advocated the belief that the world was on the verge of the last stage, known as the [[Great Tribulation]] in which a final battle will take place at [[Armageddon]] (the valley of [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]]), followed by [[Second Coming of Christ|Christ's return]], his [[Millennialism|1,000-year reign]] on earth, a final rebellion and then a final judgment, after which all mankind, devils and angels will be divided into either [[Heaven]] or the [[Lake of Fire]].<ref name=\"Kee 1998 484\">{{cite book|last=Kee|first=Howard Clark|title=Christianity: A Social and Cultural History|year=1998|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|isbn=0-13-578071-3|pages=484|author2=Emily Albu |author3=Carter Lindberg |author4=J.

This doctrine, also called biblical inerrancy, stated that the Bible was divinely inspired, religiously authoritative, and without error.<ref>Marsden (1980), pp 109\u2013118</ref><ref>Sandeen (1970) pp 103\u201331</ref> The [[Princeton Theological Seminary|Princeton Seminary]] professor of Theology [[Charles Hodge]] insisted that the Bible was inerrant because God inspired or \"breathed\" his exact thoughts into the biblical writers (2 Timothy 3:16).

Militant opposition to modernism was what most clearly set off fundamentalism.\"<ref>Marsden (1980), ''Fundamentalism and American Culture'' p. 4</ref> Others viewing militancy as a core characteristic of the fundamentalist movement include Philip Melling, Ung Kyu Pak and Ronald Witherup.<ref>Philip H. Melling, Fundamentalism in America: millennialism, identity and militant religion (1999). As another scholar points out, \"One of the major distinctives of fundamentalism is militancy.\"</ref><ref>Ung Kyu Pak, ''Millennialism in the Korean Protestant Church'' (2005) p. 211.</ref><ref>Ronald D. Witherup, a Catholic scholar, says: \"Essentially, fundamentalists see themselves as defending authentic Christian religion...

Witherup, ''Biblical Fundamentalism: What Every Catholic Should Know'' (2001) p 2</ref> [[Donald McKim]] and David Wright (1992) argue that \"in the 1920s, militant conservatives (fundamentalists) united to mount a conservative counter-offensive. Fundamentalists sought to rescue their denominations from the growth of modernism at home.\"<ref>[[Donald K. McKim]] and David F. Wright, ''Encyclopedia of the Reformed faith'' (1992) p. 148</ref>\n\nAccording to Marsden, recent scholars differentiate \"fundamentalists\" from \"evangelicals\" by arguing the former were more militant and less willing to collaborate with groups considered \"modernist\" in theology. In the 1940s the more moderate faction of fundamentalists maintained the same theology but began calling themselves \"evangelicals\" to stress their less militant position.<ref>{{cite book|author=George M.

Olson, ''Pocket History of Evangelical Theology'' (2007) p. 12</ref> Barry Hankins (2008) has a similar view, saying \"beginning in the 1940s....militant and separatist evangelicals came to be called fundamentalists, while culturally engaged and non-militant evangelicals were supposed to be called evangelicals.\"<ref>Barry Hankins, ''Francis Schaeffer and the shaping of Evangelical America'' (2008) p 233</ref>\n\nTimothy Weber views fundamentalism as \"a rather distinctive modern reaction to religious, social and intellectual changes of the late 1800s and early 1900s, a reaction that eventually took on a life of its own and changed significantly over time.\"<ref name=\"DOCA 1990\" />\n\n== In North America ==\nFundamentalist movements existed in most North American Protestant denominations by 1919 following attacks on modernist theology in [[Presbyterian]] and [[Baptist]] denominations.

At a large conference in Philadelphia in 1919, Riley founded the [[World Christian Fundamentals Association]] (WCFA), which became the chief interdenominational fundamentalist organization in the 1920s.

Rather, he argues, the cause of fundamentalism's retreat was the death of its leader, Bryan. Most fundamentalists saw the trial as a victory rather than a defeat, but Bryan's death soon afterward created a leadership void that no other fundamentalist leader could fill. Unlike the other fundamentalist leaders, Bryan brought name recognition, respectability, and the ability to forge a broad-based coalition of fundamentalist religious groups to argue in favor of the anti-evolutionist position.<ref>Mark Edwards, \"Rethinking the Failure of Fundamentalist Political Antievolutionism after 1925\".

Despite some similarities between these two causes, the creation science movement represented a shift from religious to scientific objections to Darwin's theory. Creation science also differed in terms of popular leadership, rhetorical tone, and sectional focus. It lacked a prestigious leader like Bryan, utilized scientific rather than religious rhetoric, and was a product of California and Michigan rather than the South.<ref>Willard B. Gatewood, Jr., ed.

After Scopes was convicted, creationists throughout the United States sought similar antievolution laws for their states. These included Reverends R. S. Beal and Aubrey L. Moore in Arizona and members of the Creation Research Society in California, all supported by distinguished laymen. They sought to ban evolution as a topic for study, or at least relegate it to the status of unproven theory perhaps taught alongside the biblical version of creation. Educators, scientists, and other distinguished laymen favored evolution. This struggle occurred later in the Southwest than in other US areas and persisted through the Sputnik era.<ref>George E.

The counter marginal trend, represented most notably by the infamous [[Logos Foundation (Australia)|Logos Foundation]], led by [[Howard Carter (evangelist)|Howard Carter]] in [[Toowoomba]], [[Queensland]], and later by 'manifest glory' movements such as [[Bethel Church, Redding]]<ref>https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2016/may/cover-story-inside-popular-controversial-bethel-church.html |title=Riches and Wagner (eds), Cover Story: Inside the Popular, Controversial Bethel Church.</ref> can be found in congregations such as the Range Christian Fellowship.\n\nThe ''Logos Foundation'' was an influential and controversial [[Christianity|Christian]] ministry that flourished in [[Australia]] in the 1970s and 1980s, under the leadership of [[Howard Carter (Evangelist)|Howard Carter]], originally a Baptist pastor from Auckland, New Zealand. Logos Foundation was initially a trans-denominational charismatic teaching ministry, and its members were primarily [[Protestantism|Protestant]] but it also had some ties with [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] lay groups and individuals.<ref name=\"espace.library.uq.edu.au\">https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:8027/HARRISON_eprint_.pdf</ref>\n\nLogos Foundation was [[Christian Reconstructionism|Reconstructionist]], [[Restorationism|Restorationist]], and [[Dominionism|Dominionist]] in its theology and works.\nIt was established c.1966 by Paul Collins in [[New Zealand]] as a trans-denominational teaching ministry which served the [[Charismatic Renewal]] by publishing the Logos Magazine. Paul Collins moved it to [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], c.1969, where it also facilitated large trans-denominational renewal conferences in venues such as Sydney Town Hall and the Wentworth Hotel. It was transferred to Howard Carter's leadership, relocating to Hazelbrook, lower Blue Mountains of New South Wales, where it operated for a few years, and in the mid-1970s, it was transferred to Blackheath, upper Blue Mountains. During these years the teaching ministry attracted like-minded fellowships and home groups into a loose association with it.\n\nPublishing became a significant operation, distributing charismatic themed and Restorationist teachings focused on Christian maturity and Christ's pre-eminence in short books and the monthly Logos/Restore Magazine (associated with New Wine Magazine, US). It held annual weeklong conferences of over 1,000 registrants, featuring international charismatic speakers, including [[Derek Prince]], [[Ern Baxter]], [[Don Basham]], [[Charlie Simpson (pastor)|Charles Simpson]], Bob Mumford, [[Kevin Conner]] (Australia), Peter Morrow (New Zealand) and others.\n\nA Bible College was also established nearby at Westwood Lodge, Mount Victoria. At the main site in Blackheath a Christian K-12 school, [[Mountains Christian Academy]] was established which was a forerunner of more widespread Christian independent schools and home schooling as a hallmark of the movement. It carried over the [[Old Covenant]] practice of tithing (to the local church), and expected regular sacrificial giving beyond this.\n\nTheologically it taught orthodox Christian core beliefs \u2013 however in matters of opinion Logos teaching was presented as authoritative and alternative views were discouraged. Those who questioned this teaching eventually tended to leave the movement. Over time, a strong [[cult]]-like culture of group conformity developed and those who dared to question it were quickly brought into line by other members who gave automated responses which were shrouded in spiritualised expressions. In some instances the leadership enforced unquestioning compliance by engaging in [[bullying]]-type behavior. The group viewed itself as being separate from 'the world' and it even regarded alternative views and other expressions, denominations or interpretations of Christianity with distrust at worst but considered most of them false at best.\n\nFrom the mid-1970s a hierarchical ecclesiology was adopted in the form of the [[Shepherding Movement]]'s whole-of-life discipleship of members by personal pastors (usually their \"cell group\" leaders), who in turn were also accountable to their personal pastors. Followers were informed that even their leader, Howard Carter, related as a disciple to the apostolic group in Christian Growth Ministries of Bob Mumford, Charles Simpson, Ern Baxter, Derek Prince, and Don Basham, in Ft Lauderdale, US (whose network was estimated to have approx. 150,000 people involved at its peak c.1985). Howard Carter's primary pastoral relationship was with [[Ern Baxter]], a pioneer of the [[Healing Revival]] of the 1950s and the [[Charismatic Renewal]] of the 1960s, 70s, and 80s. Written covenants of submission to the individual church pastors were encouraged for the members of one representative church, Christian Faith Centre (Sydney), and were said to be common practice throughout the movement at the time.\n\nIn 1980 the Logos movement churches adopted the name, Australian Fellowship of Covenant Communities (AFoCC), and were led through an eschatological shift in the early 1980s from the pre-millennialism of many Pentecostals (described as a theology of defeat), to the post-millennialism of the Presbyterian Reconstructionist theonomists (described as a theology of victory). A shift to an overt theological-political paradigm resulted in some senior leadership, including Pastor David Jackson of Christian Faith Centre Sydney, leaving the movement altogether. In the mid-1980s AFoCC re-branded yet again as the Covenant Evangelical Church (not associated with the Evangelical Covenant Church in the US). The Logos Foundation brand name continued as the educational, commercial and political arm of the [[Covenant Evangelical Church]].\n\nIt moved for the final time in 1986 to [[Toowoomba]], [[Queensland]] where there were already associated fellowships and a demographic environment highly conducive to the growth of extreme right-wing religio-political movements. This fertile ground saw the movement peak in a short time, reaching a local support base of upwards of 2000 people.<ref name=\"www120.secure.griffith.edu.au\">https://www120.secure.griffith.edu.au/rch/file/cb4cc218-5145-a604-f5ec-180d9177971d/1/Hey_2011_02Thesis.pdf</ref>\n\nThe move to [[Toowoomba]] involved much preparation, including members selling homes and other assets in [[New South Wales]] and the Logos Foundation acquiring many homes, businesses and commercial properties in Toowoomba and the [[Darling Downs]].\n\nIn the process of relocating the organisation and most of its members, it absorbed a number of other small Christian churches in Toowoomba. Some of these were house churches/groups more or less affiliated with Carter's other organisations. Carter and some of his followers attempted to make links with Queensland Premier Johannes Bjelke-Petersen, a known Christian conservative, in order to further their goals.\n\nCarter continued to lead the shift in eschatology to post-millennialism and prominently religio-political in nature. More of his leadership team left the movement as Carter's style became more [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and [[cult]]ish. Colin Shaw who was a key member at this time, believed that Pastor Howard Carter was an \"anointed man of God\" and Shaw later became the \"right-hand\" man of Carter in his \"outreach and missionary works\" in Quezon City, Philippines. Logos used this Filipino church, the Christian Renewal Center (a moderate Pentecostal/Charismatic church) as their base to advance and promote the teachings of the Shepherding Movement. With local assistance in the Philippines, Colin Shaw coordinated and sponsored under the Christian Renewal Centre's name, conferences featuring Carter. Many poorly educated and sincere Filipino pastors and locals, usually from small churches, were convinced to support the wider Logos movement with tithes that were collected from their limited funds. However, soon after the revelations of Howard Carter's scandalous immorality and corrupt lifestyle broke, the Filipino wing of Logos dissolved and its former members dispersed back into established local churches. Colin Shaw was said to have abandoned the Shepherding movement at this time and for a time after that, he engaged in soul searching and self exile, fueled by severe guilt over the way these Filipino Christians were manipulated.\n\nIn 1989 Logos controversially involved itself in the [[Queensland]] State election, running a campaign of surveys and full-page newspaper advertisements promoting the line that candidates' adherence to Christian principles and biblical ethics was more important than the widespread corruption in the Queensland government that had been revealed by the [[Fitzgerald Inquiry]]. Published advertisements in the Courier-Mail at the time promoted strongly conservative positions in opposition to pornography, homosexuality and abortion, and a return to the death penalty. Some supporters controversially advocated Old Testament laws and penalties.<ref>Sydney Morning Herald, 13 October 1990, \"Sex Scandal \u2013 Bible Belt\", p.74</ref> This action backfired sensationally, with many mainstream Churches, community leaders and religious organisations distancing themselves from the Logos Foundation after making public statements denouncing it.<ref name=\"espace.library.uq.edu.au\" /> At times the death penalty for homosexuals was advocated, in accordance with Old Testament Law.<ref>https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:8027/HARRISON_eprint_.pdf, p.3</ref><ref>\"Sex Scandal \u2013 Bible Belt\", Sydney Morning Herald, 13 October 1990, p.74</ref> The Sydney Morning Herald later described part of this campaign when the Logos Foundation published, \"Homosexuality and censorship should determine your vote, the electorate was told; corruption was not the major concern.\"<ref>Roberts, G., Sex Scandal Divides Bible Belt, Sydney Morning Herald, 12 October 1990</ref> The same article quoted Carter from a letter he had written to supporters at the time, \"The greenies, the gays and the greedy are marching. Now the Christians, the conservatives and the concerned must march also\". These views were not new. An earlier article published in the Herald quoted a Logos spokesman in reference to the call for the death penalty for homosexuals in order to rid Queensland of such people, who stated \"the fact a law is on the statutes is the best safeguard for society\".<ref>Lyons, J., God Remains an Issue in Queensland, Sydney Morning Herald, 18 November 1989</ref>\n\nAlthough similar behaviours existed previously, these last years in Queensland saw Logos Foundation develop cult-like tendencies. This authoritarian environment degenerated into a perverse and unbiblical abuse of power. Obedience and unhealthy submission to human leaders was cultish in many ways and the concept of submission for the purpose of 'spiritual covering' became a dominant theme in its teaching. The idea of spiritual covering soon degenerated into a system of overt abuse of power and excessive control of people's lives. This occurred despite growing opposition to the [[Shepherding Movement|Shepherding movement]] from respected [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] and Pentecostal leaders in the United States beginning as early as 1975. However, in Australia, through the Logos Foundation and Covenant Evangelical Church, this movement flourished beyond the time when it had effectively entered a period of decline in North America. Followers in Australia, were effectively quarantined by Carter from the truth of what had begun to play out in the U.S.A.\n\nThe movement had ties to a number of other groups including World MAP (Ralph Mahoney), [[California]]; Christian Growth Ministries, [[Fort Lauderdale]]; and [[R. J. Rushdoony|Rousas Rushdoony]], the father of [[Christian Reconstructionism]] in the [[United States]]. Activities included printing, publishing, conferencing, home schooling and ministry training. Logos Foundation (Australia) and these other organizations at times issued theological qualifications and other apparently academic degrees, master's degrees and doctorates following no formal process of study or recognized rigour, often under a range of dubious names that included the word \"University\". Carter conferred on himself a Master of Arts degree in 1987 which was apparently issued by the ''Pacific College Theological'',{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} an institution whose existence has been unable to be verified when investigated by journalists. Visiting preachers from the United States were frequently gifted such 'qualifications' by Carter including a PhD purportedly issued by the ''University of Oceania Sancto Spiritus''. The recipient thereafter used the title of ''Doctor'' in his itinerant preaching and revival ministry throughout North America.\n\nThe Shepherding movement worldwide descended into a cultish movement characterized by manipulative relationships, abuse of power and dubious financial arrangements. It had been an attempt by mostly sincere people, to free Christianity of the entrenched reductions of traditional and consumerist religion. However, with its emphasis on authority and submissive accountability, the movement was open to abuse. This, combined with spiritual hunger, an early measure of success and growth, mixed motives, and the inexperience of new leaders all coalesced to form a dangerous and volatile mix. Howard Carter played these factors skillfully to entrench his own position.\n\nThe Logos Foundation and Covenant Evangelical Church did not survive long the scandal of Howard Carter's standing down and public exposure of adultery in 1990. Hey (2010) has stated in his thesis, \"Suggested reasons for Carter's failure have included insecurity, an inability to open up to others, arrogance and over confidence in his own ability\".<ref name=\"www120.secure.griffith.edu.au\" /> Like many modern evangelists and mega-church leaders, he was placed on a pedestal by the movement's followers. This environment where the leader was not subject to true accountability, allowed his deception and double life to flourish unknown for many years. In the years immediately prior to this scandal, those who dared to question were quickly derided by other members or even disciplined, thus reinforcing a very unhealthy environment. When the scandal of Carter's immorality was revealed, full details of the lavish lifestyle to which he had become accustomed were also exposed. Carter's frequent travel to North America was lavish and extravagant, utilizing first class flights and five-star hotels. The full financial affairs of the organization prior to the collapse were highly secretive. Most members had been unaware of how vast sums of money involved in the whole operation were being channelled nor were they aware of how the leaders' access to these funds was being managed.\n\nA significant number of quite senior ex-Logos members found acceptance in the now-defunct Rangeville Uniting Church. The congregation of the Rangeville Uniting Church left the Uniting Church to become an independent congregation known as the Rangeville Community Church. Prior to the Rangeville Uniting Church closing an earlier split resulted in a significant percentage of the total congregation contributing to the formation of the Range Christian Fellowship in Blake Street Toowoomba.\n\nThe Range Christian Fellowship in Blake Street Toowoomba, is known for exuberant worship services and the public manifestation of charismatic phenomena and manifestations that place it well outside of mainstream Pentecostal church expression. It is possibly one of the prime Australian examples of churches which are associated with the [[New Apostolic Reformation]], a fundamentalist Pentecostal [[Christian right|religious right]] wing movement which has been described by American journalist Forrest Wilder as follows, \"Their beliefs can tend toward the bizarre.

Scripture is interpreted literally, though selectively. Unusual manifestations attributed to the [[Holy Spirit]] or the presence of 'the [[anointing]]' include women and at times even men, moaning and retching as though experiencing [[child birth]],<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.visionintlm.com/articles_view.asp?columnid=5958&articleid=66581 | title=TRAVAIL AND APOSTOLIC ORDER \u2013 Vision International Ministries}}</ref> with some claiming to be having actual [[Uterine contraction|contractions]] of the [[womb]] (known as spiritual birthing).<ref>http://www.spiritwatch.org/fireimpart.htm, 4th paragraph</ref> Dramatic and [[Apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]] predictions regarding the future were particularly evident during the time leading up to [[Y2K]], when a number of [[Prophecy|prophecies]] were publicly shared, all of which were proven false by subsequent events. Attendees are given a high degree of freedom, influenced in the church's initial years by the promotion of Jim Rutz's publication, \"The Open Church\", resulting in broad tolerance of expressions of [[revelation]], a 'word from the Lord' or [[prophecy]].\n\nAt times, people within the fellowship claim to have seen [[Vision (spirituality)|visions]] in either dreams, whilst in a [[trance]]-like state during worship, or during moments of [[religious ecstasy]], with these experiences frequently conveying a [[revelation]] or [[prophecy]]. Other occurrences have included people claiming to have been in an [[altered state of consciousness]] (referred to as 'resting in the Lord' and [[Slain in the Spirit|'slain in the spirit']] among other names), characterized by reduced external awareness and expanded interior mental and spiritual awareness, often accompanied by [[Vision (spirituality)|visions]] and emotional (and sometimes physical) [[euphoria]]. The church has hosted visits from various Christian leaders who claim to be modern day [[Apostles]] as well as many others who claim to be [[prophet]]s or [[faith healer]]s. Perhaps surprisingly, [[speaking in tongues]], which is common in other [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] churches, also occurs but it is not frequent nor is it promoted; and it is rarely witnessed in public gatherings. Neo-charismatic elements are rejected elsewhere in classical Pentecostalism, such as the [[Prayer of Jabez]], [[prosperity theology]], the [[Toronto Blessing]] (with its emphasis on strange, non-verbal expressions), George Otis' [[Spiritual Warfare]], the [[Brownsville Revival]] (Pensacola Outpouring), [[Morningstar Ministries]], the [[Lakeland Revival]], and the [[Vineyard churches|Vineyard]] group of churches, have been influential. The church has always been known for its vibrant and occasionally euphoric and ecstatic worship services, services in which music, song, dancing, flags and banners are all utilized. Range Christian Fellowship is part of the church unity movement in [[Toowoomba]], with other like-minded churches (mainstream traditional denominations have a separate [[ecumenical]] group).<ref>{{cite web|title=Christian Leaders' Network|url=https://www.facebook.com/pages/Christian-Leaders-Network-Toowoomba/199607780060750?sk=info&tab=page_info|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=17 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=One City One Church One Heart|url=http://www.onechurch.org.au/|publisher=Toowoomba Christian Leaders' Network|accessdate=17 January 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214181124/http://www.onechurch.org.au/|archivedate=14 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Christian Fellowship|first1=The Range|title=The Range Christian Fellowship|url=https://www.facebook.com/TheRangeChristianFellowship|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=17 January 2015}}</ref> This group, known as the Christian Leaders' Network, maspires to be a [[Christian right]] wing influence group within the city, at the centre of a hoped-for great [[Revivalisms|revival]] during which they will 'take the city for the Lord'.

Criticism of the church is regarded as a badge of honour by some of its members, because they view it in terms of the expected [[persecution]] of the holy remnant of the true church in the [[last days]].

Its northern terminus would be at [[Eglinton Avenue]] and [[Don Mills Road]], at [[Science Centre station]], where it would connect with [[Line 5 Eglinton]]. Its southern terminus would be at the existing [[Exhibition GO Station]] on the [[Lakeshore West line]]. The Ontario Line was announced by the [[Government of Ontario]] on April 10, 2019.<ref name=\"Cbc2019-04-10\" /><ref name=\"newsontario\" /> The Ontario government estimates the cost at {{CAD|10.9{{nbsp}}billion|link=yes}} for this {{convert|15.5|km|mi|adj=on}} line and hopes to complete the project by 2027.<ref name=\"Cbc2019-04-10\" />\n\n==Project history==\n{{see also|Relief Line (Toronto)#Ontario Line}}\nThe [[Municipal government of Toronto|City of Toronto]] had been developing a rapid transit line, known as the \"[[Relief Line (Toronto)|Relief Line South]]\",{{efn|The \"relief\" would be to overcrowding at [[Bloor\u2013Yonge station]] and the Yonge Street section of Line 1.}} between [[Pape station]] on [[Line 2 Bloor\u2013Danforth]] and [[Osgoode station]] on [[Line 1 Yonge\u2013University]]. In the early months of 2019, the Ontario government announced its intentions to take over subway construction in Toronto. In a surprise announcement in April 2019, the Ontario government announced the Ontario Line, which at that time appeared to incorporate much of the routing and many of the station locations of the Relief Line.<ref name=\"budgetontario-sec1\" /> Unlike the City design, the Ontario Line would be a \"standalone\" line, one that would use lighter rolling stock and shorter trainsets than the [[Toronto Transit Commission]]'s [[Toronto subway|existing subway lines]].<ref name=\"budgetontario\" /> Members of Toronto City Council expressed their concerns that the new line would set back the delivery of rapid transit and potentially waste money the City of Toronto had already spent on the Relief Line's design.\n\nMetrolinx prepared the plan for the Ontario Line in just three months based on a proposal by transit consultant [[Michael Schabas]]. Metrolinx hired Schabas in December 2018 to lead a team to transform the Relief Line plans into the Ontario Line. Schabas was a proponent of using lighter metro vehicles such as those used for the London's [[Docklands Light Railway]], such vehicles being suitable for steeper grades and elevated structures. A draft plan was ready by January 31, 2019. Doug Ford approved the plan after a February 26 presentation. Metrolinx kept the project a secret until the government chose to announce it on April 10.<ref name=\"TheStar-2020-02-15\">{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2020/02/15/how-fords-ontario-line-plan-came-together-in-just-three-months-with-secrecy-a-shifting-route-and-a-consultant.html |title=How Ford\u2019s Ontario Line plan came together in just three months \u2014 with secrecy, a shifting route and a consultant |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |first=Ben |last=Spurr |date={{date|2020-02-15|mdy}} |accessdate={{date|2020-02-15|mdy}}}}</ref>\n\nAs initially announced in April 2019, the route of the Ontario Line seemed to follow much of the route of the Relief Line, beginning at [[Exhibition Place]], travelling northeast to King and Bathurst Streets, then northeast to Spadina Avenue and Queen Street. It then proceeded eastward through downtown along Queen Street before turning southeast in the area of Parliament Street south to Eastern Avenue. The line had one station on King and Sumach, then made an east\u2013west crossing of the [[Don River (Ontario)|Don River]] to a station at Broadview and Eastern Avenue. The line proceeded northeast to Pape Avenue and [[Danforth Avenue]] and continued north along Pape, making a north\u2013south crossing of the Don River to the Thorncliffe Park neighbourhood. The line continued northeast along Don Mills Road to terminate at Don Mills Road and Eglinton Avenue.<ref name=\"TheStar2019-04-11\" />\n\nThe announcement that the line would extend to a new station at Ontario Place stirred controversy, as Ontario Premier [[Doug Ford]] had spoken of transforming Ontario Place, previously a family-oriented venue, into an adult-oriented [[casino]] complex, and some suspected that the plan to have the transit line extend to Ontario Place was aimed at [[Gambling tourism|visiting gamblers]]<!--Don't bypass redirect per [[WP:NOTBROKEN]]-->, not the citizens of Ontario.<ref name=\"TheStar2019-04-12a\" /><ref name=\"star-keenan\" /><ref name=\"theglobeandmail2019-04-10\" /><ref name=\"cressy-ed\" /><ref name=\"casinoscanada\" /> Ford has denied that the extension is related to any casino plans.<ref name=\"sun201904\" /> ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' reported that no previous plan had ever considered making Ontario Place a rapid transit destination and that the announcement surprised everyone, including [[Mayor of Toronto]] [[John Tory]].<ref name=\"theglobeandmail2019-04-10\" />\n\nIn July 2019, the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' obtained and reported on confidential documents from [[Metrolinx]]. They showed that the proposed route would be markedly different from that of the Relief Line South and involve significant lengths of at-grade or elevated track. The Ontario Place station was eliminated with an Exhibition station added near the [[Exhibition GO Station]]. The section between Queen/Sherbourne and Gerrard stations would come to the surface and mostly follow a railway right-of-way instead of being tunnelled. The new route would substitute a [[Corktown, Toronto|Corktown]] station about {{Convert|500|m||abbr=}} west of the proposed location for Sumach station on the Relief Line. The Ontario Line would share less than half the planned route of the Relief Line between Osgoode and Pape stations.<ref name=\"TheStar2019-07-22\" />\n\nIn October 2019, Mayor John Tory and Premier Doug Ford reached a tentative deal in which the city would endorse the line and the [[Toronto subway|TTC's subway network]] would not be taken over by the [[Government of Ontario|provincial government]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Spurr |first1=Ben |title=Mayor John Tory throws support behind Ontario Line as province drops subway upload |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2019/10/16/mayor-john-tory-throws-support-behind-ontario-line-in-deal-with-province-that-would-avoid-subway-upload.html |accessdate=October 17, 2019 |work=Toronto Star |publisher=Torstar |date=October 16, 2019}}</ref> The deal was later approved by Toronto City Council in a 22\u20133 decision.<ref>{{cite news |last=Freeman |first=Joshua |title=Council votes to approve transit expansion deal with the province |url=https://www.cp24.com/news/council-votes-to-approve-transit-expansion-deal-with-the-province-1.4661247 |work=CP24 |publisher=Bell Media |accessdate=October 30, 2019 |date=October 29, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Concerns==\nAfter a draft of the Ontario Line's business case was disclosed in July 2019, a number of concerns were raised by transit experts:\n* Doubts were expressed that the line could be completed within budget and by 2027. Metrolinx plans to start the procurement process in 2020 to allow bidding companies to comment on the feasibility of the 2027 completion date.<ref name=\"TheStar-2019-07-25\"/>\n* It may be challenging to fit the Ontario Line along GO Transit's [[Lakeshore East line|Lakeshore East corridor]]. The Ontario Line would need to be added to three existing overpasses.<ref name=\"TheStar-2019-07-25\"/> If the Ontario Line requires widening of the Lakeshore East embankment, property acquisitions may be required including nearby houses, businesses and community facilities.<ref name=\"TO-2019-10-15-A4\"><!--\"widening of the Lakeshore East GO rail corridor\"-->{{cite web |url=https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2019/ex/bgrd/backgroundfile-138946.pdf |title=Attachment 4 \u2013 Assessment of Ontario Line |website=toronto.ca |publisher=[[Municipal government of Toronto|City of Toronto]] |date=2019-10-15 |accessdate=2019-10-29 }}</ref><ref name=\"TO-2019-10-15\">{{cite web |url=https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2019/ex/bgrd/backgroundfile-138688.pdf |title=Toronto-Ontario Transit Update |website=toronto.ca |publisher=[[Municipal government of Toronto|City of Toronto]] |date=2019-10-15 |accessdate=2019-10-29 }}</ref>\n* Flood mitigation projects and reconstruction of the Gardiner Expressway at Lower Don River may impede Ontario Line construction.<ref name=\"TheStar-2019-07-25\"/>\n* There are doubts that passengers can alight and board smaller Ontario Line trains quickly enough to achieve the projected 90-second train frequency. Metrolinx insists the frequency can be met by reducing station dwell times.<ref name=\"TheStar-2019-07-25\"/>  \n* There is a concern that winter conditions may adversely affect train operations on an elevated track like [[Line 3 Scarborough]], which also uses light metro technology.<ref name=\"TheStar-2019-07-25\"/>\n* The elevated structures may have a greater environmental impact with respect to noise, vibration and visual presence than with an underground right-of-way.

The line would then turn to make a north\u2013south crossing of the Don Valley on a new bridge west of the existing Leaside Bridge that carries Millwood Road. On the south side of the valley, the line would enter a tunnel under Minton Place and continue underground to Cosburn station and Line 2's Pape station. The line would return to the surface just before Gerrard station, where it would follow GO Transit's [[Lakeshore East line|Lakeshore East rail corridor]]. The Ontario Line would have a surface station, named Leslieville, where the railway right-of-way crosses Queen. The route would continue along the railway right-of-way to East Harbour station, east of the Don River, near Eastern Avenue, where there are plans to build a new GO train station. The route would cross the Don River on a bridge, descending into a tunnel under the rail corridor just east of Cherry Street. The route would turn north through Corktown station at King and Parliament streets. Between Parliament and Berkeley streets, the line would turn west under Queen Street through Moss Park station (at Sherbourne and Queen), Queen station (at Yonge) and Osgoode station (at University Avenue). The line would continue westward to a Queen/Spadina station, then southward to a King/Bathurst station. The line would turn westward again, coming to the surface just west of Strachan Avenue before arriving at Exhibition station, its southern terminus.<ref name=\"TheStar-2019-07-22\">{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2019/07/22/ontario-line-would-run-on-just-3-kilometres-of-citys-relief-line-route-confidential-plans-show.html |title=Ontario Line would run on just 3 kilometres of city's relief line route, confidential plans show |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |first=Ben |last=Spurr |date=July 22, 2019 |accessdate=July 27, 2019 }}</ref><ref name=\"TheStar-2019-07-25\">{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2019/07/25/experts-cast-doubt-on-deadline-budget-in-ontario-line-business-case.html |title=Experts cast doubt on deadline, budget in Ontario Line business case |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |first=Ben |last=Spurr |date=July 25, 2019 |accessdate=July 26, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"G&M-2019-07-24\">{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/toronto/article-a-greater-potential-for-disruption-confidential-business-case-for/#comments |title='A greater potential for disruption': Confidential business case details plans for proposed Ontario Line subway project |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |first=Oliver |last=Moore |date=July 24, 2019 |accessdate=July 26, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Metrolinx-2019-07\"/>\n\nMetrolinx is considering a means to link Exhibition station to Ontario Place.

Its northern terminus would be at [[Eglinton Avenue]] and [[Don Mills Road]], at [[Science Centre station]], where it would connect with [[Line 5 Eglinton]]. Its southern terminus would be at the existing [[Exhibition GO Station]] on the [[Lakeshore West line]]. The Ontario Line was announced by the [[Government of Ontario]] on April 10, 2019.<ref name=\"Cbc2019-04-10\" /><ref name=\"newsontario\" /> The Ontario government estimates the cost at {{CAD|10.9{{nbsp}}billion|link=yes}} for this {{convert|15.5|km|mi|adj=on}} line and hopes to complete the project by 2027.<ref name=\"Cbc2019-04-10\" />\n\n==Project history==\n{{see also|Relief Line (Toronto)#Ontario Line}}\nThe [[Municipal government of Toronto|City of Toronto]] had been developing a rapid transit line, known as the \"[[Relief Line (Toronto)|Relief Line South]]\",{{efn|The \"relief\" would be to overcrowding at [[Bloor\u2013Yonge station]] and the Yonge Street section of Line 1.}} between [[Pape station]] on [[Line 2 Bloor\u2013Danforth]] and [[Osgoode station]] on [[Line 1 Yonge\u2013University]]. In the early months of 2019, the Ontario government announced its intentions to take over subway construction in Toronto. In a surprise announcement in April 2019, the Ontario government announced the Ontario Line, which at that time appeared to incorporate much of the routing and many of the station locations of the Relief Line.<ref name=\"budgetontario-sec1\" /> Unlike the City design, the Ontario Line would be a \"standalone\" line, one that would use lighter rolling stock and shorter trainsets than the [[Toronto Transit Commission]]'s [[Toronto subway|existing subway lines]].<ref name=\"budgetontario\" /> Members of Toronto City Council expressed their concerns that the new line would set back the delivery of rapid transit and potentially waste money the City of Toronto had already spent on the Relief Line's design.\n\nMetrolinx prepared the plan for the Ontario Line in just three months based on a proposal by transit consultant [[Michael Schabas]]. Metrolinx hired Schabas in December 2018 to lead a team to transform the Relief Line plans into the Ontario Line. Schabas was a proponent of using lighter metro vehicles such as those used for the London's [[Docklands Light Railway]], such vehicles being suitable for steeper grades and elevated structures. A draft plan was ready by January 31, 2019. Doug Ford approved the plan after a February 26 presentation. Metrolinx kept the project a secret until the government chose to announce it on April 10.<ref name=\"TheStar-2020-02-15\">{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2020/02/15/how-fords-ontario-line-plan-came-together-in-just-three-months-with-secrecy-a-shifting-route-and-a-consultant.html |title=How Ford\u2019s Ontario Line plan came together in just three months \u2014 with secrecy, a shifting route and a consultant |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |first=Ben |last=Spurr |date={{date|2020-02-15|mdy}} |accessdate={{date|2020-02-15|mdy}}}}</ref>\n\nAs initially announced in April 2019, the route of the Ontario Line seemed to follow much of the route of the Relief Line, beginning at [[Exhibition Place]], travelling northeast to King and Bathurst Streets, then northeast to Spadina Avenue and Queen Street. It then proceeded eastward through downtown along Queen Street before turning southeast in the area of Parliament Street south to Eastern Avenue. The line had one station on King and Sumach, then made an east\u2013west crossing of the [[Don River (Ontario)|Don River]] to a station at Broadview and Eastern Avenue. The line proceeded northeast to Pape Avenue and [[Danforth Avenue]] and continued north along Pape, making a north\u2013south crossing of the Don River to the Thorncliffe Park neighbourhood. The line continued northeast along Don Mills Road to terminate at Don Mills Road and Eglinton Avenue.<ref name=\"TheStar2019-04-11\" />\n\nThe announcement that the line would extend to a new station at Ontario Place stirred controversy, as Ontario Premier [[Doug Ford]] had spoken of transforming Ontario Place, previously a family-oriented venue, into an adult-oriented [[casino]] complex, and some suspected that the plan to have the transit line extend to Ontario Place was aimed at [[Gambling tourism|visiting gamblers]]<!--Don't bypass redirect per [[WP:NOTBROKEN]]-->, not the citizens of Ontario.<ref name=\"TheStar2019-04-12a\" /><ref name=\"star-keenan\" /><ref name=\"theglobeandmail2019-04-10\" /><ref name=\"cressy-ed\" /><ref name=\"casinoscanada\" /> Ford has denied that the extension is related to any casino plans.<ref name=\"sun201904\" /> ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' reported that no previous plan had ever considered making Ontario Place a rapid transit destination and that the announcement surprised everyone, including [[Mayor of Toronto]] [[John Tory]].<ref name=\"theglobeandmail2019-04-10\" />\n\nIn July 2019, the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' obtained and reported on confidential documents from [[Metrolinx]]. They showed that the proposed route would be markedly different from that of the Relief Line South and involve significant lengths of at-grade or elevated track. The Ontario Place station was eliminated with an Exhibition station added near the [[Exhibition GO Station]]. The section between Queen/Sherbourne and Gerrard stations would come to the surface and mostly follow a railway right-of-way instead of being tunnelled. The new route would substitute a [[Corktown, Toronto|Corktown]] station about {{Convert|500|m||abbr=}} west of the proposed location for Sumach station on the Relief Line. The Ontario Line would share less than half the planned route of the Relief Line between Osgoode and Pape stations.<ref name=\"TheStar2019-07-22\" />\n\nIn October 2019, Mayor John Tory and Premier Doug Ford reached a tentative deal in which the city would endorse the line and the [[Toronto subway|TTC's subway network]] would not be taken over by the [[Government of Ontario|provincial government]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Spurr |first1=Ben |title=Mayor John Tory throws support behind Ontario Line as province drops subway upload |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2019/10/16/mayor-john-tory-throws-support-behind-ontario-line-in-deal-with-province-that-would-avoid-subway-upload.html |accessdate=October 17, 2019 |work=Toronto Star |publisher=Torstar |date=October 16, 2019}}</ref> The deal was later approved by Toronto City Council in a 22\u20133 decision.<ref>{{cite news |last=Freeman |first=Joshua |title=Council votes to approve transit expansion deal with the province |url=https://www.cp24.com/news/council-votes-to-approve-transit-expansion-deal-with-the-province-1.4661247 |work=CP24 |publisher=Bell Media |accessdate=October 30, 2019 |date=October 29, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Concerns==\nAfter a draft of the Ontario Line's business case was disclosed in July 2019, a number of concerns were raised by transit experts:\n* Doubts were expressed that the line could be completed within budget and by 2027.

The line would then turn to make a north\u2013south crossing of the Don Valley on a new bridge west of the existing Leaside Bridge that carries Millwood Road. On the south side of the valley, the line would enter a tunnel under Minton Place and continue underground to Cosburn station and Line 2's Pape station. The line would return to the surface just before Gerrard station, where it would follow GO Transit's [[Lakeshore East line|Lakeshore East rail corridor]]. The Ontario Line would have a surface station, named Leslieville, where the railway right-of-way crosses Queen. The route would continue along the railway right-of-way to East Harbour station, east of the Don River, near Eastern Avenue, where there are plans to build a new GO train station. The route would cross the Don River on a bridge, descending into a tunnel under the rail corridor just east of Cherry Street. The route would turn north through Corktown station at King and Parliament streets.

In this it closely resembles the [[passacaglia]].\n\nThe ground bass, if there is one, may typically descend stepwise from the [[Tonic (music)|tonic]] to the [[Dominant (music)|dominant]] pitch of the [[Scale (music)|scale]]; the harmonies given to the upper parts may emphasize the [[circle of fifths]] or a derivative pattern thereof.\n\n==History==\n\nThough it originally emerged during the late sixteenth century in [[Spain|Spanish]] culture, having reputedly been introduced from the [[New World]], as a quick dance-song characterized by suggestive movements and mocking texts,<ref>Alexander Silbiger, \"Chaconne,\" ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', ed. [[Stanley Sadie]] and J. Tyrrell (London: Macmillan, 2001).</ref> by the early eighteenth century the chaconne had evolved into a slow [[triple metre|triple meter]] instrumental form. \n\n[[Alex Ross (music critic)|Alex Ross]] describes the origins of the ''chacona'' as actually having been a sexily swirling dance that appeared in [[South America]] at the end of the sixteenth century and quickly spread to Europe. The dance became popular both in the elite courts and in the general population. \"Un sarao de la chacona\"<ref>\"Un sarao de la chacona\" translates as ''A chacona soir\u00e9e'' and is also known as \"Chacona: A la vida bona\".

This 256-measure chaconne takes a plaintive four-[[bar (music)|bar]] phrase through a continuous [[kaleidoscope]] of musical expression in both major and minor [[Musical mode|modes]].  However, recently it has been proposed that the form of Bach's \"Ciaccona\" (he used the Italian form of the name, rather than the French \"Chaconne\") is really cast in the form of a French theatrical dance known as the \"passacaille\",{{Clarify|date=February 2020|reason=Does Erickson contend that this \"theatrical\" passacaille is distinct from the passacaglia, which is said elsewhere in this article to be \"closely related\" to the chaconne?}} although it also incorporates Italian and German style features as well.<ref>Raymond Erickson, \"Toward a 21st-Century Interpretation of Bach's Ciaccona for Solo Violin, BWV 1004/5,\" The American Bach Society Newsletter, Spring 2003</ref> \n\nAfter the [[baroque music|Baroque period]], the chaconne fell into decline during the 19th century, though the [[32 Variations in C minor (Beethoven)|32 Variations in C minor]] by [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] suggest its continuing influence.
