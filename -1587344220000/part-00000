He and his family developed the adjacent village of [[Drums, Pennsylvania|Drums]], of which the village is named after the family, along with helping the development of Conyngham.  Drums is a sister village to Conyngham.  The George Drum residence remains standing in impeccable condition on Conyngham's Main Street.<ref>The Conyngham Borough Centennial Committee, \"A Centennial History of Conyngham Borough 1901-2001\" , Citizen Publishing Co., Hazleton, Pa. 2001, p.95</ref>\n\nThe [[Sugarloaf Massacre]] of September 11, 1780, was one of a series of bloody engagements fought in the frontier of northeastern Pennsylvania between [[Iroquois]] (allies of British troops) and settlers loyal to the cause of American independence. Today, this event is commemorated by a historic monument with a bronze plaque bearing the names of the fifteen men who lost their lives near modern-day Conyngham.\n\nIn 1815, Redmond Conyngham represented Luzerne County in the [[Pennsylvania House of Representatives]]. In 1820, he served a term in the [[Pennsylvania State Senate|State Senate]]. Captain [[Gustavus Conyngham]] was his cousin. He was an unsung hero of the [[American Revolution|Revolution]]. He commanded a privateer and was the first to carry the American flag in the [[English Channel]]. The townspeople suggested naming the village after Redmond Conyngham, but he replied that the town should be named in honor of his cousin, Gustavus, who frequently made trips to England to obtain military supplies for revolutionary colonists.<ref>The Conyngham Borough Centennial Committee, \"A Centennial History of Conyngham Borough 1901-2001, Citizen Publishing Company, Hazleton, Pa.2001, p.8</ref>\n\nIn the 1800s, the [[Lehigh-Susquehanna Turnpike]] traveled through the middle of modern-day Main Street in Conyngham.<ref>Hazelton or Nesquehoning quadrangle made in 1893.

He and his family developed the adjacent village of [[Drums, Pennsylvania|Drums]], of which the village is named after the family, along with helping the development of Conyngham.  Drums is a sister village to Conyngham.  The George Drum residence remains standing in impeccable condition on Conyngham's Main Street.<ref>The Conyngham Borough Centennial Committee, \"A Centennial History of Conyngham Borough 1901-2001\" , Citizen Publishing Co., Hazleton, Pa. 2001, p.95</ref>\n\nThe [[Sugarloaf Massacre]] of September 11, 1780, was one of a series of bloody engagements fought in the frontier of northeastern Pennsylvania between [[Iroquois]] (allies of British troops) and settlers loyal to the cause of American independence. Today, this event is commemorated by a historic monument with a bronze plaque bearing the names of the fifteen men who lost their lives near modern-day Conyngham.\n\nIn 1815, Redmond Conyngham represented Luzerne County in the [[Pennsylvania House of Representatives]]. In 1820, he served a term in the [[Pennsylvania State Senate|State Senate]]. Captain [[Gustavus Conyngham]] was his cousin. He was an unsung hero of the [[American Revolution|Revolution]]. He commanded a privateer and was the first to carry the American flag in the [[English Channel]]. The townspeople suggested naming the village after Redmond Conyngham, but he replied that the town should be named in honor of his cousin, Gustavus, who frequently made trips to England to obtain military supplies for revolutionary colonists.<ref>The Conyngham Borough Centennial Committee, \"A Centennial History of Conyngham Borough 1901-2001, Citizen Publishing Company, Hazleton, Pa.2001, p.8</ref>\n\nIn the 1800s, the [[Lehigh-Susquehanna Turnpike]] traveled through the middle of modern-day Main Street in Conyngham.<ref>Hazelton or Nesquehoning quadrangle made in 1893.

Several complaints have been made against him to the [[Canadian Broadcast Standards Council]] (CBSC). In a 1994 complaint to the CBSC, listeners alleged that Green had been rude and abusive to a caller who identified herself as a Christian. Although the CBSC determined that Green's conduct had contravened its guidelines on discrimination, it also decided that the station had responded appropriately, and the group did not prescribe any further action. In 2006 and 2008, the council censured Green for his treatment of a Muslim man who challenged Green on the way the radio show host portrays Islam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|archivedate=21 November 2010|accessdate=2010-11-30|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|archivedate=8 October 2011|accessdate=2009-08-07|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  In June 2017, there was controversy as to whether [[Indigo Books and Music]] had pulled Green's latest book, ''Amazing But True!'', from its bookshelves in stores in Canada.<ref>{{cite news|last=Johnston|first=Geoffrey|url=http://www.thewhig.com/2017/06/01/author-battles-censorship|title=Author battles 'censorship'|date=1 June 2017|newspaper=The Kingston Whig-Standard|accessdate=12 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.facebook.com/lgreen.ca/ Lowell Green at Facebook]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090212100107/http://cbsc.ca/english/decisions/1994/940604.php 1994 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php 2006 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php 2009 decision]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Green, Lowell}}\n[[Category:1936 births]]\n[[Category:Canadian non-fiction writers]]\n[[Category:Canadian people of Irish descent]]\n[[Category:Canadian talk radio hosts]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:McGill University alumni]]\n[[Category:Ontario Liberal Party candidates in Ontario provincial elections]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ann Arbor, Michigan]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ottawa]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Canadian radio personality}}\n{{Use Canadian English|date=February 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n{{Infobox presenter\n|name        = Lowell Green\n|alias       = \n|image       = Lowell Green.jpg|<nowiki>Lowell Green]]</nowiki>\n|image_size  = \n|caption     = \n|birth_name  = \n|birth_date  = {{Birth date and age|df=yes|1936|07|07}}\n|birth_place = [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], [[USA]]\n|death_date  = \n|death_place = \n|show        = ''The Lowell Green Show''\n|station     = [[CFRA (AM)|CFRA]] Ottawa\n|timeslot    = Weekdays 10 am to 12pm\n|show2       = \n|station2    = \n|timeslot2   = \n|style       = [[Talk radio]]\n|country     = Canada\n|prevshow    = Greenline\n|website     = \n|spouse      = Deborah Green\n|awards      = }}\n\n'''Lowell Green''' (born 7 July 1936) is a Canadian radio personality, journalist, and author, best known as the host of ''The Lowell Green Show'', a conservative morning [[talk show]] that aired on the [[Ottawa]] [[Ontario]] radio station [[CFRA]].

Although the CBSC determined that Green's conduct had contravened its guidelines on discrimination, it also decided that the station had responded appropriately, and the group did not prescribe any further action. In 2006 and 2008, the council censured Green for his treatment of a Muslim man who challenged Green on the way the radio show host portrays Islam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|archivedate=21 November 2010|accessdate=2010-11-30|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|archivedate=8 October 2011|accessdate=2009-08-07|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  In June 2017, there was controversy as to whether [[Indigo Books and Music]] had pulled Green's latest book, ''Amazing But True!'', from its bookshelves in stores in Canada.<ref>{{cite news|last=Johnston|first=Geoffrey|url=http://www.thewhig.com/2017/06/01/author-battles-censorship|title=Author battles 'censorship'|date=1 June 2017|newspaper=The Kingston Whig-Standard|accessdate=12 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.facebook.com/lgreen.ca/ Lowell Green at Facebook]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090212100107/http://cbsc.ca/english/decisions/1994/940604.php 1994 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php 2006 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php 2009 decision]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Green, Lowell}}\n[[Category:1936 births]]\n[[Category:Canadian non-fiction writers]]\n[[Category:Canadian people of Irish descent]]\n[[Category:Canadian talk radio hosts]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:McGill University alumni]]\n[[Category:Ontario Liberal Party candidates in Ontario provincial elections]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ann Arbor, Michigan]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ottawa]]\n", "name_user": "WildStar", "label": "safe", "comment": "Addtions to Career and Accomplishments sections.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowell_Green"}
