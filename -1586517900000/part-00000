In the films, Rocky is portrayed as an underdog fighter that does battle with numerous brutal opponents, and wins the [[List of heavyweight boxing champions|world heavyweight championship]] twice.

He also attempted, albeit unsuccessfully, roles in different genres. In 1984, he co-wrote and starred alongside [[Dolly Parton]] in the comedy film ''[[Rhinestone (film)|Rhinestone]]'', where he played a wannabe country music singer. For the [[Rhinestone (film soundtrack)|''Rhinestone'' soundtrack]], he performed a song. Stallone turned down the lead male role in ''[[Romancing the Stone]]'' in order to make ''Rhinestone'' instead, a decision he later regretted.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/evening-sylvester-stallone-quotes/ |title=Sylvester Stallone: in his own words |magazine=Empire |date=January 14, 2014 |access-date=March 31, 2018}}</ref> In 1987, he starred in the family drama ''[[Over the Top (1987 film)|Over the Top]]'' as a struggling trucker who tries to make amends with his estranged son. These films did not do well at the box office and were poorly received by critics. It was around 1985 that Stallone was signed to a remake of the 1939 [[James Cagney]] classic ''[[Angels With Dirty Faces]]''. The film would form part of his multi-picture deal with Cannon Films and was to co-star [[Christopher Reeve]] and be directed by [[Menahem Golan]]. The re-making of such a beloved classic was met with disapproval by ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' and horror by top critic [[Roger Ebert]]. Cannon opted to make ''[[Cobra (1986 film)|Cobra]]'' instead. ''Cobra'' (1986) and the [[buddy cop]] action film ''[[Tango & Cash]]'' (1989), the latter alongside [[Kurt Russell]], did solid business domestically and blockbuster business overseas, grossing over {{US$|100}}&nbsp;million in foreign markets and over {{US$|160}}&nbsp;million worldwide.\n\nStallone began the 1990s starring in the fifth installment of the ''Rocky'' franchise, ''[[Rocky V]]''. This film brought back the original film's director John G. Avildsen. It was considered a [[box office bomb|box office disappointment]].<ref>{{cite news|title='Home' KOs 'Rocky V' at Box Office : Movies: The comedy grabs {{US$|17}}&nbsp;million in receipts to take the No. 1 spot over Stallone's much-hyped sequel.|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1990-11-20/entertainment/ca-5106_1_weekend-box|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=November 20, 1990}}</ref> He attempted the comedy genre, starring in two comedies during the early 1990s, the critical and commercial disasters ''[[Oscar (1991 film)|Oscar]]'' (1991) and ''[[Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot]]'' (1992).\n\nIn 1993, he made a comeback with the hit ''[[Cliffhanger (film)|Cliffhanger]]'', which was a success in the US, grossing {{US$|84}}&nbsp;million, but even more successful worldwide, grossing {{US$|171}}&nbsp;million. Later that year, he starred with [[Wesley Snipes]] in the [[futuristic]] action film ''[[Demolition Man (film)|Demolition Man]]'', which grossed over {{US$|158}}&nbsp;million worldwide. His string of hits continued with 1994's ''[[The Specialist]]'' (over {{US$|170}}&nbsp;million worldwide gross). In 1995, he played the futuristic character [[Judge Dredd]] (from the British comic book ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'') in the eponymous film ''[[Judge Dredd (1995 film)|Judge Dredd]]''. His overseas box office appeal saved the domestic box office disappointment of ''Judge Dredd'', which cost almost {{US$|100}}&nbsp;million and barely made its budget back, with a worldwide tally of {{US$|113}}&nbsp;million. He also appeared in the thriller ''[[Assassins (film)|Assassins]]'' (1995) with [[Julianne Moore]] and [[Antonio Banderas]]. In 1996, he starred in the [[disaster film]] ''[[Daylight (1996 film)|Daylight]]''.\n\nThat same year, Stallone, along with an all-star cast of celebrities, appeared in the [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] short comedy film \"[[Your Studio and You]]\" commissioned by the [[Seagram]] Company for a party celebrating their acquisition of [[Universal Studios]] and the MCA Corporation. Stallone speaks in his Rocky Balboa voice with subtitles translating what he is saying. At one point, Stallone starts yelling about how can they use his Balboa character, that he left it in the past; the narrator calms him with a [[wine cooler]] and calling him \"brainiac.\" In response, Stallone says, \"Thank you very much.\" He then looks at the wine cooler and exclaims, \"Stupid cheap studio!\"<ref>[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6493841613076981287 Your Studio and you] (From Google Video) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020045255/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6493841613076981287 |date=October 20, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing his breakthrough performance in ''Rocky'', critic Roger Ebert had stated that Stallone could become the next [[Marlon Brando]], though he barely recaptured the critical acclaim achieved with ''Rocky''. Stallone did go on to receive acclaim for his role in the crime drama ''[[Cop Land]]'' (1997), in which he starred alongside [[Robert De Niro]] and [[Ray Liotta]]. His performance led him to win the [[Stockholm International Film Festival]] Best Actor Award. In 1998, he did voice-over work for the computer-animated film ''[[Antz]]'', which was a big hit domestically.\n\n===Declining years===\nIn 2000, Stallone starred in the thriller ''[[Get Carter (2000 film)|Get Carter]]'', a remake of the 1971 British [[Michael Caine]] film of the [[Get Carter|same name]], but the film was poorly received by both critics and audiences. Stallone's career declined considerably after his subsequent films ''[[Driven (2001 film)|Driven]]'' (2001), ''[[Avenging Angelo]]'' (2002) and ''[[D-Tox]]'' (2002) were also critical and commercial failures. In 2003, he played a villainous role in the third installment of the ''[[Spy Kids (film series)|Spy Kids]]'' series: ''[[Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over]]'', which was a huge box office success (almost {{US$|200}}&nbsp;million worldwide). Stallone also had a cameo appearance in the 2003 French film ''[[Taxi 3]]'' as a passenger.\n\nFollowing several poorly reviewed box office flops, Stallone started to regain prominence for his supporting role in the [[neo-noir]] crime drama ''[[Shade (film)|Shade]]'' (2003) which was only released in a limited fashion but was praised by critics.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/shade/ |title=Shade |website=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=September 4, 2010}}</ref> He was also attached to star and direct a film tentatively titled ''Rampart Scandal'', which was to be about the murder of rappers [[Tupac Shakur]] and [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] and the surrounding [[Los Angeles Police Department]] corruption scandal.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1472396/20030606/story.jhtml|title=Sylvester Stallone Making Movie About Biggie, Tupac Murders|last=Patel|first=Joseph|date=June 6, 2003|publisher=[[MTV News]] |accessdate=January 9, 2010}}</ref> It was later titled ''Notorious'' but was shelved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurweb.com/story/eur30196.cfm |title=Stallone's Tupac/Biggie Movie a No Go: Actor was to play LAPD detective who found dirty cops at root of murders |date=December 7, 2006 |publisher=EURWeb.com |accessdate=January 9, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, he was the co-presenter, alongside [[Sugar Ray Leonard]], of the [[NBC]] Reality television boxing series ''[[The Contender (TV series)|The Contender]]''.

American actor, director, screenwriter, and producer.\n\nAfter his beginnings as a struggling actor for a number of years upon arriving to [[New York City]] in 1969 and later [[Hollywood]] in 1974, he won his first critical acclaim as an actor for his co-starring role as Stanley Rosiello in ''[[The Lords of Flatbush]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/lords-of-flatbush/|title=45 Years Ago: 'The Lords of Flatbush' Introduces Rocky and Fonzie|first=Michael|last=Christopher|website=Ultimate Classic Rock}}</ref>\n\nStallone mostly only found gradual work as an extra or side character in films with a sizeable budget until he achieved his greatest critical and commercial success as an actor, starting in 1976 with his self-created role as the boxer [[Rocky Balboa]], in the first film of the successful [[Rocky (film series)|''Rocky'' series]] (1976\u20132018). In the films, Rocky is portrayed as an underdog fighter that does battle with numerous brutal opponents, and wins the [[List of heavyweight boxing champions|world heavyweight championship]] twice. The last two entries in the series are  ''[[Creed (film)|Creed]]'' and ''[[Creed II]]'', that serve as spin-off films focusing on [[Donnie Creed|Adonis \"Donnie\" Creed]], the son of the ill-fated boxer [[Apollo Creed]], to whom the long retired Rocky is a mentor. Reprising the role during the 2010s brought Stallone praise, and his first [[Golden Globe]] award for the first ''Creed'', as well as a third [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nomination, having been first nominated for the same role 40 years prior.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/golden-globes/2016/01/12/golden-globes-sylvester-stallone-ryan-coogler-michael-b-jordan-apology/|title=Sylvester Stallone says he owes 'Creed' team 'everything' after Globes omission|website=EW.com}}</ref>\n\nStallone had similar box-office success, portraying the [[PTSD]] plagued soldier [[John Rambo]] in the five [[Rambo (film series)|''Rambo'' films]] (1982\u20132019) and as mercenary [[List of characters from The Expendables film series#Barney Ross|Barney Ross]] in the three [[The Expendables (film series)|''The Expendables'' films]] (2010\u20132014). He wrote or co-wrote most of the films in his three biggest franchises, and directed many of them.\n\nStallone's film ''[[Rocky]]'' was inducted into the [[National Film Registry]], and had its props placed in the [[Smithsonian Museum]]. His use of the front entrance to the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] in the ''Rocky'' series led the area to be nicknamed the [[Rocky Steps]], and [[Philadelphia]] has a statue of his Rocky character placed permanently near the museum. It was announced on December 7, 2010 that he was voted into the [[International Boxing Hall of Fame]] in the non-participant category.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/pet-rock-1.811972/sylvester-stallone-hall-of-famer-1.2523881 |title=Sylvester Stallone, hall of famer |date=December 7, 2010 |work=Newsday |accessdate=December 7, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101211122730/http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/pet-rock-1.811972/sylvester-stallone-hall-of-famer-1.2523881 |archivedate=December 11, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1977, Stallone was nominated for two Academy Awards for ''Rocky'', for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]].

Rainbo''.\n\nStallone's other first few film roles were minor, and included brief uncredited appearances in ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]'' (1970) as a soldier sitting at a table, ''[[Pigeons (film)|Pigeons]]'' (1970) as a party guest, [[Woody Allen]]'s ''[[Bananas (film)|Bananas]]'' (1971) as a subway thug, in the psychological thriller ''[[Klute]]'' (1971) as an extra dancing in a club, and in the [[Jack Lemmon]] film ''[[The Prisoner of Second Avenue]]'' (1975) as a youth. In the Lemmon film, Jack Lemmon's character chases, tackles and mugs Stallone, thinking that Stallone's character is a pickpocket. He had his second starring role in ''[[The Lords of Flatbush]]'', in 1974.<ref name=tca/> In 1975, he played supporting roles in ''[[Farewell, My Lovely (1975 film)|Farewell, My Lovely]]''; ''[[Capone (film)|Capone]]''; and ''[[Death Race 2000]]''. He made guest appearances on the TV series ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'' and ''[[Kojak]]''. He is also supposedly in ''[[Mandingo (film)|Mandingo]]''.

Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff became interested and offered Stallone {{US$|350,000}} for the rights, but had their own casting ideas for the lead role, including [[Robert Redford]] and [[Burt Reynolds]]. Stallone refused to sell unless he played the lead character and eventually, after a substantial budget cut to compromise, it was agreed he could be the star.<ref>{{cite book| last = Nelson| first= Murray R.| title = American Sports: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas [4 Volumes]: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas | date= May 23, 2013 | page= 1095}}</ref>\n\n''Rocky'' was nominated for ten [[Academy Award]]s, including [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] and [[Academy Award for Writing Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] nominations for Stallone. The film went on to win the Academy Awards for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Directing]] and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]].\n\nFollowing the success of ''Rocky'', Stallone made his directorial debut and starred in the 1978 film ''[[Paradise Alley]]'', a family drama in which he played one of three brothers who enter the world of [[wrestling]]. That same year, he starred in [[Norman Jewison]]'s ''[[F.I.S.T.]]'', a social drama in which he plays a warehouse worker, very loosely modelled on [[James Hoffa]], who becomes involved in the labor union leadership. In 1979 he wrote, directed and starred in the sequel to his 1976 hit, ''[[Rocky II]]'' (replacing [[John G. Avildsen]], who won an Academy Award for directing the first film), which also became a major success,<ref name=tca/> grossing {{US$|200}}&nbsp;million. In 1981, he starred alongside [[Michael Caine]] and soccer star [[Pel\u00e9]] in ''[[Escape to Victory]]'', a sports drama in which he plays a [[prisoner of war]] involved in a Nazi propaganda soccer game. That same year, he starred in the thriller ''[[Nighthawks (1981 film)|Nighthawks]]'', in which he plays a New York city cop who plays a cat-and-mouse game with a foreign terrorist, played by [[Rutger Hauer]].\n\n===Continued success with more ''Rocky'', ''Rambo'' and additional action roles===\n[[File:Stallone-Hollywood-Star.jpg|thumb|upright|Sylvester Stallone Hollywood Star on [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]]]\nStallone launched another major franchise success, starring as [[Vietnam-American War|Vietnam]] veteran [[John Rambo]], a former Green Beret, in the action film ''[[First Blood]]'' (1982).<ref name=tca/> The first installment of ''Rambo'' was both a critical and box office success. Critics praised Stallone's performance, saying he made Rambo seem human, as opposed to the way he is portrayed in the book of the same name. Three Rambo sequels, ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'' (1985), ''[[Rambo III]]'' (1988), ''[[Rambo (2008 film)|Rambo]]'' (2008), and ''[[Rambo: Last Blood]]'' (2019) followed. He also continued his box office success with the ''Rocky'' franchise and wrote, directed, and starred in two more 1980s sequels to the series: ''[[Rocky III]]'' (1982) and ''[[Rocky IV]]'' (1985). Stallone has portrayed these two characters in a total of eleven films. In preparation for these roles, Stallone embarked upon a vigorous training regimen, which often meant six days a week in the gym and further sit-ups in the evenings. Stallone claims to have reduced his [[body fat percentage]] to his all-time low of 2.8% for ''Rocky III''.<ref>Berg, Michael. ''Muscle & Fitness'', Sept. 2004.</ref> Stallone met former [[Mr. Olympia]] [[Franco Columbu]] to develop his character's appearance for the films ''Rocky IV'' and ''Rambo II'', just as if he were preparing for the Mr. Olympia competition.

He also attempted, albeit unsuccessfully, roles in different genres. In 1984, he co-wrote and starred alongside [[Dolly Parton]] in the comedy film ''[[Rhinestone (film)|Rhinestone]]'', where he played a wannabe country music singer. For the [[Rhinestone (film soundtrack)|''Rhinestone'' soundtrack]], he performed a song. Stallone turned down the lead male role in ''[[Romancing the Stone]]'' in order to make ''Rhinestone'' instead, a decision he later regretted.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/evening-sylvester-stallone-quotes/ |title=Sylvester Stallone: in his own words |magazine=Empire |date=January 14, 2014 |access-date=March 31, 2018}}</ref> In 1987, he starred in the family drama ''[[Over the Top (1987 film)|Over the Top]]'' as a struggling trucker who tries to make amends with his estranged son. These films did not do well at the box office and were poorly received by critics. It was around 1985 that Stallone was signed to a remake of the 1939 [[James Cagney]] classic ''[[Angels With Dirty Faces]]''. The film would form part of his multi-picture deal with Cannon Films and was to co-star [[Christopher Reeve]] and be directed by [[Menahem Golan]]. The re-making of such a beloved classic was met with disapproval by ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' and horror by top critic [[Roger Ebert]]. Cannon opted to make ''[[Cobra (1986 film)|Cobra]]'' instead. ''Cobra'' (1986) and the [[buddy cop]] action film ''[[Tango & Cash]]'' (1989), the latter alongside [[Kurt Russell]], did solid business domestically and blockbuster business overseas, grossing over {{US$|100}}&nbsp;million in foreign markets and over {{US$|160}}&nbsp;million worldwide.\n\nStallone began the 1990s starring in the fifth installment of the ''Rocky'' franchise, ''[[Rocky V]]''. This film brought back the original film's director John G. Avildsen. It was considered a [[box office bomb|box office disappointment]].<ref>{{cite news|title='Home' KOs 'Rocky V' at Box Office : Movies: The comedy grabs {{US$|17}}&nbsp;million in receipts to take the No. 1 spot over Stallone's much-hyped sequel.|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1990-11-20/entertainment/ca-5106_1_weekend-box|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=November 20, 1990}}</ref> He attempted the comedy genre, starring in two comedies during the early 1990s, the critical and commercial disasters ''[[Oscar (1991 film)|Oscar]]'' (1991) and ''[[Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot]]'' (1992).\n\nIn 1993, he made a comeback with the hit ''[[Cliffhanger (film)|Cliffhanger]]'', which was a success in the US, grossing {{US$|84}}&nbsp;million, but even more successful worldwide, grossing {{US$|171}}&nbsp;million. Later that year, he starred with [[Wesley Snipes]] in the [[futuristic]] action film ''[[Demolition Man (film)|Demolition Man]]'', which grossed over {{US$|158}}&nbsp;million worldwide. His string of hits continued with 1994's ''[[The Specialist]]'' (over {{US$|170}}&nbsp;million worldwide gross). In 1995, he played the futuristic character [[Judge Dredd]] (from the British comic book ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'') in the eponymous film ''[[Judge Dredd (1995 film)|Judge Dredd]]''. His overseas box office appeal saved the domestic box office disappointment of ''Judge Dredd'', which cost almost {{US$|100}}&nbsp;million and barely made its budget back, with a worldwide tally of {{US$|113}}&nbsp;million. He also appeared in the thriller ''[[Assassins (film)|Assassins]]'' (1995) with [[Julianne Moore]] and [[Antonio Banderas]]. In 1996, he starred in the [[disaster film]] ''[[Daylight (1996 film)|Daylight]]''.\n\nThat same year, Stallone, along with an all-star cast of celebrities, appeared in the [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] short comedy film \"[[Your Studio and You]]\" commissioned by the [[Seagram]] Company for a party celebrating their acquisition of [[Universal Studios]] and the MCA Corporation. Stallone speaks in his Rocky Balboa voice with subtitles translating what he is saying. At one point, Stallone starts yelling about how can they use his Balboa character, that he left it in the past; the narrator calms him with a [[wine cooler]] and calling him \"brainiac.\" In response, Stallone says, \"Thank you very much.\" He then looks at the wine cooler and exclaims, \"Stupid cheap studio!\"<ref>[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6493841613076981287 Your Studio and you] (From Google Video) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020045255/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6493841613076981287 |date=October 20, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing his breakthrough performance in ''Rocky'', critic Roger Ebert had stated that Stallone could become the next [[Marlon Brando]], though he barely recaptured the critical acclaim achieved with ''Rocky''. Stallone did go on to receive acclaim for his role in the crime drama ''[[Cop Land]]'' (1997), in which he starred alongside [[Robert De Niro]] and [[Ray Liotta]]. His performance led him to win the [[Stockholm International Film Festival]] Best Actor Award. In 1998, he did voice-over work for the computer-animated film ''[[Antz]]'', which was a big hit domestically.\n\n===Declining years===\nIn 2000, Stallone starred in the thriller ''[[Get Carter (2000 film)|Get Carter]]'', a remake of the 1971 British [[Michael Caine]] film of the [[Get Carter|same name]], but the film was poorly received by both critics and audiences. Stallone's career declined considerably after his subsequent films ''[[Driven (2001 film)|Driven]]'' (2001), ''[[Avenging Angelo]]'' (2002) and ''[[D-Tox]]'' (2002) were also critical and commercial failures. In 2003, he played a villainous role in the third installment of the ''[[Spy Kids (film series)|Spy Kids]]'' series: ''[[Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over]]'', which was a huge box office success (almost {{US$|200}}&nbsp;million worldwide). Stallone also had a cameo appearance in the 2003 French film ''[[Taxi 3]]'' as a passenger.\n\nFollowing several poorly reviewed box office flops, Stallone started to regain prominence for his supporting role in the [[neo-noir]] crime drama ''[[Shade (film)|Shade]]'' (2003) which was only released in a limited fashion but was praised by critics.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/shade/ |title=Shade |website=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=September 4, 2010}}</ref> He was also attached to star and direct a film tentatively titled ''Rampart Scandal'', which was to be about the murder of rappers [[Tupac Shakur]] and [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] and the surrounding [[Los Angeles Police Department]] corruption scandal.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1472396/20030606/story.jhtml|title=Sylvester Stallone Making Movie About Biggie, Tupac Murders|last=Patel|first=Joseph|date=June 6, 2003|publisher=[[MTV News]] |accessdate=January 9, 2010}}</ref> It was later titled ''Notorious'' but was shelved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurweb.com/story/eur30196.cfm |title=Stallone's Tupac/Biggie Movie a No Go: Actor was to play LAPD detective who found dirty cops at root of murders |date=December 7, 2006 |publisher=EURWeb.com |accessdate=January 9, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, he was the co-presenter, alongside [[Sugar Ray Leonard]], of the [[NBC]] Reality television boxing series ''[[The Contender (TV series)|The Contender]]''.

After the critical and box office failure of the previous installment ''[[Rocky V]]'', Stallone had decided to write, direct and star in a sixth installment which would be a more appropriate climax to the series.
