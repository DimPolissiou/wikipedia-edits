In Denmark and Norway though, the game is known as Ludo.\n* In Vietnam, it is called \"C\u1edd c\u00e1 ng\u1ef1a\".\n* In France, it is called \"Petits Chevaux\" (Little Horses) or \"Le Jeu de Dada\" (The Game of Dada) (dada being a colloquial word for \"horse\") and typically played with horse-headed pieces.<ref name=\"Parlett\">Parlett (1999), p. 49.</ref>\n* In Hungary, this game is called \"Ki nevet a v\u00e9g\u00e9n\" (Who laughs at the end).\n\n== Ludo board ==\n[[File:Ludo-3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|An original Ludo board]]\nSpecial areas of the Ludo board are typically coloured bright yellow, green, red, and blue. Each player is assigned a colour and has four tokens{{efn|Tokens were originally flat bone discs;<ref name=Bell_1983 /> modern materials are cardboard or plastic.}} in their colour. The board is normally square with a cross-shaped {{boardgloss|playspace}}, with each arm of the cross having three columns of squares, usually six per column. The middle columns usually have five squares coloured; these represent a player's ''home column''. A sixth coloured square not on the home column is a player's ''starting square''. At the centre of the board is a large ''finishing square'', often composed of coloured triangles atop the players' home columns (thus depicting \"arrows\" pointing to the finish).\n\n== Rules ==\n\n=== Overview ===\n[[File:Ludo_paths.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|Trajectory of tokens of each colour on the original Ludo board]]\nTwo, three, or four can play, without partnerships.{{efn|name=2to4|\"From two to four play, each with four pieces, and without partnerships.\"<ref name=Parlett />}} At the beginning of the game, each player's four tokens are out of play and {{boardgloss|staging area|staged}} in the player's ''yard'' (one of the large corner areas of the board in the player's colour). When able to, the players will enter their tokens one per turn on their respective starting squares, and proceed to race them clockwise around the board along the ''game track'' (the path of squares not part of any player's home column). When reaching the square below his home column, a player continues by moving tokens up the column to the finishing square. The rolls of a single [[Dice|die]]<!-- Please don't change \"die\" to \"dice\" -- a single die is rolled by players in this game; \"dice rolls\" implies two or more. --><ref name=Parlett /><ref name=DG_p13 /> control the swiftness of the tokens, and entry to the finishing square requires a precise roll from the player. The first to bring all their tokens to the finish wins the game. The others often continue play to determine second-, third-, and fourth-place finishers.\n\n===Gameplay<ref name=\":0\" />===\nEach player rolls the die<!-- Please don't change \"die\" to \"dice\" -- a single die is rolled by players in this game; \"dice rolls\" implies two or more. -->; the highest roller begins the game. Players alternate turns in a clockwise direction.\n\nTo enter a token into play from its yard to its starting square, a player must roll a ''6''.<ref name=Parlett /><ref name=\"DG_p13\">Diagram Group (1975), p. 13.</ref> If the player has no tokens yet in play and rolls other than a ''6'', the turn passes to the next player. Once a player has one or more tokens in play, he selects a token and moves it forwards along the track the number of squares indicated by the die<!-- Please don't change \"die\" to \"dice\" -- a single die is rolled by players in this game; \"dice rolls\" implies two or more. -->. Players must always move a token according to the die<!-- Please don't change \"die\" to \"dice\" -- a single die is rolled by players in this game; \"dice rolls\" implies two or more. --> value rolled. {{boardgloss|pass|Passes}} are not allowed; if no move is possible, the turn moves to the next player.\n\nWhen a ''6'' is rolled, the player may choose to advance a token already in play, or may enter another staged token to its starting square. Rolling a ''6'' earns the player an additional or \"bonus\" roll in that turn. If the bonus roll results in a ''6'' again, the player earns an additional bonus roll.{{efn|\"Should a player throw two 6s in succession, he is allowed a third throw.\"<ref name=DG_p13 />}} If the third roll is also a ''6'', the player may not move and the turn immediately passes to the next player.\n\nPlayers may not end their move on a square they already occupy. If the advance of a token ends on a square occupied by an opponent's token, the opponent token is returned to its owner's yard. The returned token can be reentered into play only when the owner rolls a ''6''. Unlike Pachisi, there are no \"safe\" squares on the game track which protect a player's tokens from being returned. A player's home column squares are always safe, however, since no opponent may enter them.\n\n== Variations ==\n[[File:Narayangarh-12.JPG|thumb|upright=1.4|right|[[Pachisi]] variant being played on a Ludo board in [[Nepal]]]]\n* Ludo played in the [[Indian subcontinent]] features a safe square in each quadrant, normally the fourth square from the top in the rightmost column. These squares are usually marked with a star. In India Ludo is often played with two dice, and rolling ''1'' on a die<!-- Please don't change \"die\" to \"dice\" -- a single die is rolled by players in this game; \"dice rolls\" implies two or more. --> also allows a token to enter active play. Thus if a player rolls a ''1'' and a ''6'', they may get a token out and move it six steps.\n*In [[Pakistan]], a variation that uses two dice allows backwards movement. The dice are rolled and the die<!-- Please don't change \"die\" to \"dice\" -- a single die is rolled by players in this game; \"dice rolls\" implies two or more. --> values can be used independently or in combination to move two pieces or a single piece forwards or backwards or both. (E.g., if the roll gives ''1'' and ''4'', the player can move a single piece 4 steps forwards and then 1 step backwards, or 1 step forwards and 4 steps backwards, or 1 then 4 steps forwards or backwards. Or the player can move a piece 1 step forwards or backwards, and another piece 4 steps forwards or backwards.)\n* To get a game started faster, some [[house rule]]s allow a player with no pieces on the board to bring their first piece into play on any roll, on a ''1'' or a ''6'', or allow multiple tries to roll a ''6'' (with three rolls being the most popular).\n* If a piece lands on the same space as another piece of the same colour, the moved piece must take the preceding space.\n* If a piece lands on the same space as another piece(s) of the same colour, the pieces are doubled or combined and form a ''block'' which cannot be passed or taken by any opponent's pieces.<ref name=\"Bell_1983\">Bell (1983), p. 113.</ref> Some variations permit such blocks to be passed by rolling a ''6'' or ''1''.\n* A block of two or more pieces can be taken by an opponent's single piece.<ref>Murray (1978), p. 138.</ref>\n* Doubled pieces may move half the number if an even number is thrown (e.g. move two spaces if a ''4'' is thrown).\n* A doubled piece may capture another doubled piece (like in [[Coppit]]). Three pieces together are weak and can be cut by a single piece.\n\n* A board may have only four spaces in each home column. All four of a player's pieces must finish in these spaces for the player to have finished the game. (See {{lang|de|[[Mensch \u00e4rgere dich nicht]]}}.)\n* A player must move all the numbers rolled (e.g. if a player rolls multiple ''6s'', they have to use all the numbers to move).\n* A player cannot capture or enter finish if they have numbers remaining. (E.g., if a player rolls a ''6'' and a ''2'' and they have the option to capture or enter finish with one of their pieces using the ''2'', they can only do so if they have another piece that can use the ''6''.)\n* To speed the game up, extra turns or bonus moves can be awarded for capturing a piece or getting a piece home; these may grant passage past a block.\n* In Denmark and some other countries the board has eight spaces marked with a globe and eight with a star. The globes are safe spaces where a piece cannot be captured. The exception is that a player who has not yet entered all pieces, can always enter a piece on a roll of ''6''. If the entry space is occupied by another player's piece, that piece is captured. Otherwise the entry spaces work like the other globe spaces. A piece which would have landed on a star instead moves to the next star.\n* In Vietnam, it is called \"C\u1edd c\u00e1 ng\u1ef1a\", where the game is modeled after a horse race with the tokens modeled as horse heads. In this variation, a ''1'' is given equal status to a ''6'' (meaning that the player can enter a token into play and can roll again). Furthermore, once a player's token reaches their home column, it can only go up each square with an exact roll. This means that a person outside the column must roll a ''1'' to enter the first square, a ''2'' afterwards to enter the second, and so forth.\n\n[[File:Ludu Play 02.jpg|thumb|A player about to throw the dice]]\n\n=== African variations ===\nIn some parts of Africa the following rules are reportedly played:\n* A doubled block also blocks trailing pieces of the player who created the block, or blocks them unless they roll the exact number to land on the block; additionally, the doubled block cannot move forwards until the block that landed upon it moves off again. This reduces the tactical advantage of a block and makes the game more interesting.\n* If the two players sitting opposite are partners, the players can exchange numbers.\n* There are four safety squares on the board, like castle squares in Pachisi, as well as the safe home squares, where a piece may able to move forwards or backwards and start their turn before previous player finishes.\n* A piece landing on a square with an opponent's piece not only sends the opponent piece back to the starting area but also sends the landing piece to its home square.\n* A player cannot move their first piece into the home column unless they have captured at least one piece of any of the opponents.\n* If a player captures the piece of another player, they are awarded a bonus roll. If in the bonus roll, another player's piece is captured, another bonus roll is awarded and so on.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist|notes=|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n* {{cite book\n |last=Bell\n |first=R.

The contemporary version was played by the [[Mughal empire|Mughal emperors]] of India; a notable example is [[Akbar]].<ref>Grunfeld (1975), p. 27</ref>\n\nPachisi was modified to use a cubic die<!-- Please don't change \"die\" to \"dice\" -- a single die is rolled by players in this game; \"dice rolls\" implies two or more. --> with dice cup and patented as \"Ludo\" in England in 1896.{{efn|Patent number 14636.<ref name=Bell_p12 />}}<ref name=\"Bell_p12\">{{cite book |last=Bell |first=R.

Variations of the game are sold under the brand names ''[[Sorry! (game)|Sorry!]]'' and ''[[Trouble (board game)|Trouble]]''.\n* In Spain, it is called \"[[Parch\u00eds]]\" in Spanish and \"[[:ca:Parx\u00eds|Parx\u00eds]]\" in Catalan.\n* In Colombia, it is called \"[[Parqu\u00e9s]]\".\n*In Ghana, it is called \"six mi Ludo\".\n* In China, Malaysia and Singapore, the game is called \"\u98de\u884c\u68cb\" or \"\u98de\u673a\u68cb\" ([[Aeroplane Chess]]).\n\n=== Similar German game ===\nGerman similar game from 1914 is called the \"[[Mensch \u00e4rgere dich nicht]]\" (Man, Don't Get Angry), and has equivalent names in many other languages:\n* In Greece, the game is called \"\u0393\u03ba\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03b9\u03ac\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2\" [Griniaris] (Grumbler) referring to typical player behaviour.\n* In Italy, it is called \"Non t'arrabbiare\" (Don't get upset).\n* In Bulgaria, this game is called \"\u041d\u0435 \u0441\u0435 \u0441\u044a\u0440\u0434\u0438 \u0447\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435\" (Don't get angry man).\n* In Romania, this game is called \"Nu te sup\u0103ra, frate!\" (Do not be upset, brother!).\n* In North America, this game is called ''[[Aggravation (board game)|Aggravation]]''\n* In Poland, it is commonly referred to as \"Chi\u0144czyk\" (The Chinese), though an equivalent form to the German name also exists (\"Cz\u0142owieku, nie irytuj si\u0119!\").\n* In Estonia, it is called \"Reis \u00fcmber maailma\" (Trip around the world).\n* In Latvia, it is called \"Ri\u010du ra\u010du\".\n* In Sweden, it is known as \"Fia\", a name derived from the Latin word ''fiat'' which means \"so be it!\" Common variations on the name are \"Fia-spel\" (Fia the game) and \"Fia med knuff\" (Fia with push). In Denmark and Norway though, the game is known as Ludo.\n* In Vietnam, it is called \"C\u1edd c\u00e1 ng\u1ef1a\".\n* In France, it is called \"Petits Chevaux\" (Little Horses) or \"Le Jeu de Dada\" (The Game of Dada) (dada being a colloquial word for \"horse\") and typically played with horse-headed pieces.<ref name=\"Parlett\">Parlett (1999), p. 49.</ref>\n* In Hungary, this game is called \"Ki nevet a v\u00e9g\u00e9n\" (Who laughs at the end).\n\n== Ludo board ==\n[[File:Ludo-3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|An original Ludo board]]\nSpecial areas of the Ludo board are typically coloured bright yellow, green, red, and blue. Each player is assigned a colour and has four tokens{{efn|Tokens were originally flat bone discs;<ref name=Bell_1983 /> modern materials are cardboard or plastic.}} in their colour. The board is normally square with a cross-shaped {{boardgloss|playspace}}, with each arm of the cross having three columns of squares, usually six per column. The middle columns usually have five squares coloured; these represent a player's ''home column''. A sixth coloured square not on the home column is a player's ''starting square''. At the centre of the board is a large ''finishing square'', often composed of coloured triangles atop the players' home columns (thus depicting \"arrows\" pointing to the finish).\n\n== Rules ==\n\n=== Overview ===\n[[File:Ludo_paths.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|Trajectory of tokens of each colour on the original Ludo board]]\nTwo, three, or four can play, without partnerships.{{efn|name=2to4|\"From two to four play, each with four pieces, and without partnerships.\"<ref name=Parlett />}} At the beginning of the game, each player's four tokens are out of play and {{boardgloss|staging area|staged}} in the player's ''yard'' (one of the large corner areas of the board in the player's colour). When able to, the players will enter their tokens one per turn on their respective starting squares, and proceed to race them clockwise around the board along the ''game track'' (the path of squares not part of any player's home column). When reaching the square below his home column, a player continues by moving tokens up the column to the finishing square. The rolls of a single [[Dice|die]]<!-- Please don't change \"die\" to \"dice\" -- a single die is rolled by players in this game; \"dice rolls\" implies two or more. --><ref name=Parlett /><ref name=DG_p13 /> control the swiftness of the tokens, and entry to the finishing square requires a precise roll from the player. The first to bring all their tokens to the finish wins the game. The others often continue play to determine second-, third-, and fourth-place finishers.\n\n===Gameplay<ref name=\":0\" />===\nEach player rolls the die<!-- Please don't change \"die\" to \"dice\" -- a single die is rolled by players in this game; \"dice rolls\" implies two or more. -->; the highest roller begins the game. Players alternate turns in a clockwise direction.\n\nTo enter a token into play from its yard to its starting square, a player must roll a ''6''.<ref name=Parlett /><ref name=\"DG_p13\">Diagram Group (1975), p. 13.</ref> If the player has no tokens yet in play and rolls other than a ''6'', the turn passes to the next player. Once a player has one or more tokens in play, he selects a token and moves it forwards along the track the number of squares indicated by the die<!-- Please don't change \"die\" to \"dice\" -- a single die is rolled by players in this game; \"dice rolls\" implies two or more. -->. Players must always move a token according to the die<!-- Please don't change \"die\" to \"dice\" -- a single die is rolled by players in this game; \"dice rolls\" implies two or more. --> value rolled. {{boardgloss|pass|Passes}} are not allowed; if no move is possible, the turn moves to the next player.\n\nWhen a ''6'' is rolled, the player may choose to advance a token already in play, or may enter another staged token to its starting square. Rolling a ''6'' earns the player an additional or \"bonus\" roll in that turn. If the bonus roll results in a ''6'' again, the player earns an additional bonus roll.{{efn|\"Should a player throw two 6s in succession, he is allowed a third throw.\"<ref name=DG_p13 />}} If the third roll is also a ''6'', the player may not move and the turn immediately passes to the next player.\n\nPlayers may not end their move on a square they already occupy. If the advance of a token ends on a square occupied by an opponent's token, the opponent token is returned to its owner's yard. The returned token can be reentered into play only when the owner rolls a ''6''. Unlike Pachisi, there are no \"safe\" squares on the game track which protect a player's tokens from being returned. A player's home column squares are always safe, however, since no opponent may enter them.\n\n== Variations ==\n[[File:Narayangarh-12.JPG|thumb|upright=1.4|right|[[Pachisi]] variant being played on a Ludo board in [[Nepal]]]]\n* Ludo played in the [[Indian subcontinent]] features a safe square in each quadrant, normally the fourth square from the top in the rightmost column. These squares are usually marked with a star. In India Ludo is often played with two dice, and rolling ''1'' on a die<!-- Please don't change \"die\" to \"dice\" -- a single die is rolled by players in this game; \"dice rolls\" implies two or more. --> also allows a token to enter active play. Thus if a player rolls a ''1'' and a ''6'', they may get a token out and move it six steps.\n*In [[Pakistan]], a variation that uses two dice allows backwards movement. The dice are rolled and the die<!-- Please don't change \"die\" to \"dice\" -- a single die is rolled by players in this game; \"dice rolls\" implies two or more. --> values can be used independently or in combination to move two pieces or a single piece forwards or backwards or both. (E.g., if the roll gives ''1'' and ''4'', the player can move a single piece 4 steps forwards and then 1 step backwards, or 1 step forwards and 4 steps backwards, or 1 then 4 steps forwards or backwards. Or the player can move a piece 1 step forwards or backwards, and another piece 4 steps forwards or backwards.)\n* To get a game started faster, some [[house rule]]s allow a player with no pieces on the board to bring their first piece into play on any roll, on a ''1'' or a ''6'', or allow multiple tries to roll a ''6'' (with three rolls being the most popular).\n* If a piece lands on the same space as another piece of the same colour, the moved piece must take the preceding space.\n* If a piece lands on the same space as another piece(s) of the same colour, the pieces are doubled or combined and form a ''block'' which cannot be passed or taken by any opponent's pieces.<ref name=\"Bell_1983\">Bell (1983), p. 113.</ref> Some variations permit such blocks to be passed by rolling a ''6'' or ''1''.\n* A block of two or more pieces can be taken by an opponent's single piece.<ref>Murray (1978), p. 138.</ref>\n* Doubled pieces may move half the number if an even number is thrown (e.g. move two spaces if a ''4'' is thrown).\n* A doubled piece may capture another doubled piece (like in [[Coppit]]). Three pieces together are weak and can be cut by a single piece.\n\n* A board may have only four spaces in each home column. All four of a player's pieces must finish in these spaces for the player to have finished the game. (See {{lang|de|[[Mensch \u00e4rgere dich nicht]]}}.)\n* A player must move all the numbers rolled (e.g. if a player rolls multiple ''6s'', they have to use all the numbers to move).\n* A player cannot capture or enter finish if they have numbers remaining. (E.g., if a player rolls a ''6'' and a ''2'' and they have the option to capture or enter finish with one of their pieces using the ''2'', they can only do so if they have another piece that can use the ''6''.)\n* To speed the game up, extra turns or bonus moves can be awarded for capturing a piece or getting a piece home; these may grant passage past a block.\n* In Denmark and some other countries the board has eight spaces marked with a globe and eight with a star. The globes are safe spaces where a piece cannot be captured. The exception is that a player who has not yet entered all pieces, can always enter a piece on a roll of ''6''. If the entry space is occupied by another player's piece, that piece is captured. Otherwise the entry spaces work like the other globe spaces. A piece which would have landed on a star instead moves to the next star.\n* In Vietnam, it is called \"C\u1edd c\u00e1 ng\u1ef1a\", where the game is modeled after a horse race with the tokens modeled as horse heads. In this variation, a ''1'' is given equal status to a ''6'' (meaning that the player can enter a token into play and can roll again). Furthermore, once a player's token reaches their home column, it can only go up each square with an exact roll. This means that a person outside the column must roll a ''1'' to enter the first square, a ''2'' afterwards to enter the second, and so forth.\n\n[[File:Ludu Play 02.jpg|thumb|A player about to throw the dice]]\n\n=== African variations ===\nIn some parts of Africa the following rules are reportedly played:\n* A doubled block also blocks trailing pieces of the player who created the block, or blocks them unless they roll the exact number to land on the block; additionally, the doubled block cannot move forwards until the block that landed upon it moves off again. This reduces the tactical advantage of a block and makes the game more interesting.\n* If the two players sitting opposite are partners, the players can exchange numbers.\n* There are four safety squares on the board, like castle squares in Pachisi, as well as the safe home squares, where a piece may able to move forwards or backwards and start their turn before previous player finishes.\n* A piece landing on a square with an opponent's piece not only sends the opponent piece back to the starting area but also sends the landing piece to its home square.\n* A player cannot move their first piece into the home column unless they have captured at least one piece of any of the opponents.\n* If a player captures the piece of another player, they are awarded a bonus roll.

White]], [[William Miller (preacher)]] and [[Joseph Bates (Adventist)]] began to study eschatological implications revealed in the [[Book of Daniel]] and the [[Book of Revelation]]. Their interpretation of Christian eschatology resulted in the founding of the [[Seventh-day Adventist church]].\n\n==Christian eschatological views==\n\nThe following approaches arose from the study of Christianity's most central eschatological document, the [[Book of Revelation]], but the principles embodied in them can be applied to all prophecy in the [[Bible]]. They are by no means mutually exclusive and are often combined to form a more complete and coherent interpretation of prophetic passages. Most interpretations fit into one, or a combination, of these approaches. The alternate methods of prophetic interpretation, [[Futurism (Christianity)|Futurism]] and [[Preterism]] which came from Jesuit writings, were brought about to oppose the [[Historicism]] interpretation which had been used from Biblical times<ref>\"Jesuit scholarship rallied to the Roman cause by providing two plausible alternatives to the historical interpretation of the Protestants. 1. Luis de Alcazar (1554-1630) of Seville, Spain, devised what became known as the 'preterist' system of prophetic interpretation. This theory proposed that the Revelation deals with events in the Pagan Roman Empire, that antichrist refers to Nero and that the prophecies were therefore fulfilled long before the time of the medieval church. Alcazar's preterist system has never made any impact on the conservative, or evangelical wing of the Protestant movement, although in the last one hundred years it has become popular among Protestant rationalists and liberals. 2. A far more successful attack was taken by Francisco Ribera (1537 - 1591) of Salamanca, Spain. He was the founder of the 'futurist' system of prophetic interpretation. Instead of placing antichrist way in the past as did Alcazar, Ribera argues that antichrist would appear way in the future. About 1590 Ribera published a five hundred page commentary on the Apocalypse, denying the Protestant application of antichrist to the church of Rome.\" M.L.

This school of thought interprets the [[Book of Daniel]] as referring to events that happened from the 7th century BC until the first century AD, while seeing the prophecies of [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] as events that happened in the [[Christianity in the 1st century|first century AD]]. Preterism holds that [[Ancient Israel]] finds its [[Supersessionism|continuation or fulfillment]] in the [[Christian church]] at the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70]].\n\nHistorically, preterists and  non-preterists have generally agreed that the Jesuit [[Luis del Alc\u00e1zar|Luis de Alcasar]]  (1554\u20131613) wrote the first systematic preterist exposition of prophecy\u2014''Vestigatio arcani sensus in Apocalypsi'' (published in 1614)\u2014during the [[Counter-Reformation]].\n\n===Historicism===\n[[Historicism]], a method of interpretation of [[Biblical prophecy|Biblical prophecies]], associates [[symbol]]s with historical persons, nations or events. It can result in a view of progressive and continuous fulfillment of prophecy covering the period from [[Biblical times]] to the [[Second Coming]].

Historicism===\nExpositors of the traditional Protestant interpretation of Revelation known as [[Historicism (Christian eschatology)|Historicism]] have often maintained that Revelation was written in AD 96 and not [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|AD 70]]. [[Edward Bishop Elliott]], in the ''[[Horae Apocalypticae]]'' (1862), argues that John wrote the book in exile on [[Patmos]] \"at the close of the reign of Domitian; that is near the end of the year 95 or beginning of 96\". He notes that\nDomitian was assassinated in September 96.<ref name = \"ElliottV1\">{{Citation | first = Edward Bishop | last = Elliott | author-link = Edward Bishop Elliott | title = Horae Apocalypticae | publisher = Seely, Jackson and Halliday | place = London | edition = 5th | volume = I | year = 1862| title-link = Horae Apocalypticae }}</ref>{{rp|47}} Elliot begins his lengthy review of historical evidence by quoting [[Irenaeus]], a disciple of [[Polycarp]].

Futurism===\nThe division between these interpretations can be somewhat blurred. \nMost futurists are expecting a [[rapture]] of the Church, an [[antichrist]], a [[Great Tribulation]] and a [[second coming]] of Christ in the near future. But they also accept certain past events, such as the rebirth of the State of [[Israel]] and the reunification of [[Jerusalem]] as prerequisites to them, in a manner which the earlier historicists have done with other dates. Futurists, who do not normally use the [[day-year principle]], interpret the [[Prophecy of Seventy Weeks]] in Daniel 9:24 as years, just as historicists do. Most historicists have chosen timelines, from beginning to end, entirely in the past,<ref>e.g. 312 AD to 1572, 538 AD to 1798, and 606 AD to 1870. See [[day-year principle]]</ref> but some, such as [[Adam Clarke]], have timelines which also commenced with specific past events, but require a future fulfillment. In his commentary on Daniel 8:14 published in 1831, he stated that the 2,300-year period should be calculated from 334 BC, the year [[Alexander the Great]] began his conquest of the Persian Empire.<ref name=\"sacred-texts\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/cmt/clarke/dan.htm|title=Commentary on the Bible by Adam Clarke: Daniel: Daniel index|website=www.sacred-texts.com}}</ref> His calculation resulted in the year 1966. He seems to have overlooked the fact that there is no \"year zero\" between BC and AD dates. For example, the year following 1 BC is 1 AD. Thus his calculations should have required an additional year, ending in 1967. He was not anticipating a literal regathering of the Jewish people prior to the second coming of Christ. But the date is of special significance to futurists since it is the year of Jerusalem's capture by Israeli forces during the [[Six-Day War]].\nHis commentary on Daniel 7:25 contains a 1260-year period commencing in 755 AD and ending in 2015.<ref name=\"sacred-texts\"/>\n\n==Major theological positions==\n\n===Premillennialism===\n{{Main|Premillennialism}}\nStandard premillennialism posits that Christ's second coming will inaugurate a literal thousand-year earthly kingdom. Christ's return will coincide with a time of great tribulation. At this time, there will be a resurrection of the people of God who have died, and a rapture of the people of God who are still living, and they will meet Christ at his coming. A thousand years of peace will follow, during which Christ will reign and Satan will be imprisoned in the Abyss. Those who hold to this view usually fall into one of the following three categories:\n\n====Pretribulation rapture====\n{{Main|Pretribulationism}}\nPretribulationists believe that the second coming will be in two stages separated by a seven-year period of tribulation. At the beginning of the tribulation, true Christians will rise to meet the Lord in the air (the Rapture). Then follows a seven-year period of suffering in which the Antichrist will conquer the world and persecute those who refuse to worship him. At the end of this period, Christ returns to defeat the Antichrist and establish the age of peace. This position is supported by a scripture which says, \"God did not appoint us to wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.\" [1 Thess 5:9]\n\n====Midtribulation rapture====\n{{Main|Midtribulationism}}\nMidtribulationists believe that the Rapture will take place at the halfway point of the seven-year tribulation, i.e. after 3\u00bd years. It coincides with the \"abomination of desolation\"\u2014a desecration of the temple where the Antichrist puts an end to the Jewish sacrifices, sets up his own image in the temple, and demands that he be worshiped as God. This event begins the second, most intense part of the tribulation.\n\nSome interpreters find support for the \"midtrib\" position by comparing a passage in Paul's epistles with the book of Revelation. Paul says, \"We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed\" (1 Cor 15:51-52). Revelation divides the great tribulation into three sets of increasingly catastrophic judgments: the Seven Seals, the Seven Trumpets, and the Seven Bowls, in that order. If the \"last trumpet\" of Paul is equated with the last trumpet of Revelation, the Rapture would be in the middle of the Tribulation. (Not all interpreters agree with this literal interpretation of the chronology of Revelation, however.)\n\n====Posttribulation rapture====\n{{Main|Post-Tribulation Rapture}}\nPosttribulationists hold that Christ will not return until the end of the tribulation. Christians, rather than being raptured at the beginning of the tribulation, or halfway through, will live through it and suffer for their faith during the ascendancy of the Antichrist. Proponents of this position believe that the presence of believers during the tribulation is necessary for a final evangelistic effort during a time when external conditions will combine with the Gospel message to bring great numbers of converts into the Church in time for the beginning of the Millennium.\n\n===Postmillennialism===\n{{Main|Postmillennialism}}\nPostmillennialism is an interpretation of chapter 20 of the [[Book of Revelation]] which sees [[Christ]]'s [[second coming]] as occurring ''after'' the \"[[millennialism|Millennium]]\", a [[Golden Age]] in which [[Christian ethics]] prosper.<ref>David T. Steineker, ''The Greatest Commandment: Matthew 22:37'' (Bloomington, IN: WestBow Press, 2010), 132.</ref> The term subsumes several similar views of the end times, and it stands in contrast to [[premillennialism]] and, to a lesser extent, [[amillennialism]].\n\nPostmillennialism holds that Jesus Christ establishes his kingdom on earth through his preaching and redemptive work in the first century and that he equips his church with the gospel, empowers her by the Spirit, and charges her with the Great Commission (Matt 28:19) to disciple all nations. Postmillennialism expects that eventually the vast majority of people living will be saved. Increasing gospel success will gradually produce a time in history prior to Christ's return in which faith, righteousness, peace, and prosperity will prevail in the affairs of men and of nations. After an extensive era of such conditions Jesus Christ will return visibly, bodily, and gloriously, to end history with the general resurrection and the final judgment after which the eternal order follows.\n\nPostmillenialism was a dominant theological belief among American Protestants who promoted reform movements in the 19th and 20th century such as abolitionism<ref>Randall M. Miller, ''Religion and the American Civil War'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998), 115.</ref> and the [[Social Gospel]].<ref>Douglas M. Strong, ''Perfectionist Politics: Abolitionism and the Religious Tensions of American Democracy'' (Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 2002), 30.</ref> Postmillennialism has become one of the key tenets of a movement known as [[Christian Reconstructionism]]. It has been criticized by 20th century religious conservatives as an attempt to [[immanentize the eschaton]].\n\n===Amillennialism===\n{{Main|Amillennialism}}\nAmillennialism, in Christian eschatology, involves the rejection of the belief that [[Jesus]] will have a literal, thousand-year-long, physical reign on the earth. This rejection contrasts with [[premillennialism|premillennial]] and some [[postmillennialism|postmillennial]] interpretations of [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=rev+20 chapter 20] of the [[Book of Revelation]].\n\nThe amillennial view regards the \"thousand years\" mentioned in Revelation 20 as a [[symbol]]ic number, not as a literal description; amillennialists hold that the [[millennium]] has already begun and is identical with the current [[Dispensation (period)|church age]]. Amillennialism holds that while Christ's reign during the millennium is [[spirit]]ual in nature, at the end of the church age, [[Second Coming of Christ|Christ will return]] in [[last judgment|final judgment]] and establish a permanent reign in the new heaven and new earth.\n\nMany proponents dislike the name \"amillennialism\" because it emphasizes their differences with premillennialism rather than their beliefs about the millennium. \"Amillennial\" was actually coined in a pejorative way by those who hold premillennial views. Some proponents also prefer alternate terms such as ''nunc-millennialism'' (that is, now-millennialism) or ''realized millennialism'', although these other names have achieved only limited acceptance and usage.<ref>Anthony Hoekema, [http://www.the-highway.com/amila_Hoekema.html \"Amillennialism\"]</ref>\n\n==Death and the afterlife==\n\n===Jewish beliefs at the time of Jesus===\n{{see also|Second Temple Judaism}}\nThere were different schools of thought on the afterlife in [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]] during the first century AD. The [[Sadducees]], who recognized only the [[Torah]] (first five books of the Old Testament) as authoritative, did not believe in an afterlife or any resurrection of the dead. The [[Pharisees]], who not only accepted the Torah, but [[Development of the Hebrew Bible canon|additional scriptures as well]], believed in the [[Resurrection of the Dead#Judaism|resurrection of the dead]], and it is known to have been a major point of contention between the two groups (see {{bibleverse||Acts|23:8}}). The Pharisees based their belief on passages such as {{bibleverse||Daniel|12:2}}, which says: \"Multitudes who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake: some to everlasting life, others to shame and everlasting contempt.\"\n\n===The intermediate state===\n{{main|Intermediate state}}\nSome traditions (notably the Seventh-day Adventists) teach that the [[soul sleep]]s after death, and will not awake again until the [[resurrection of the dead]], while others believe the spirit goes to an intermediate place where it will live consciously until the resurrection of the dead. By \"soul\", Seventh-day Adventists theologians mean the physical person (monism), and that no component of human nature survives death; therefore, each human will be \"recreated\" at resurrection. The biblical [[Book of Ezekiel]] provides substantiation for the assertion that souls experience mortality, \u201cBehold, all souls are Mine; The soul of the father As well as the soul of the son is Mine; The soul who sins shall die.\" (Ezekiel 18:4) <ref>{{cite web|title=Ezekiel 18:4|url=https://biblia.com/books/nkjv/Eze18.4|website=Biblia.com|publisher=Faithlife.com|accessdate=8 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' says:\n:Each man receives his eternal retribution in his [[immortal soul]] at the very moment of his death, in a [[particular judgment]] that refers his life to Christ: either entrance into the blessedness of [[Heaven (Christianity)|heaven]]\u2014through a [[Purgatory|purification]] or immediately\u2014or immediate and everlasting [[damnation]]. (Sect. 1022)\n\n===Purgatory===\n{{main|Purgatory}}\nSome denominations (a notable exception are [[Seventh-day Adventists]]) affirm the statement from the ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' (above), with the exception of the parenthetical phrase, \"through a purification or immediately\". This alludes to the Catholic belief in a spiritual state, known as Purgatory, in which those souls who are not condemned to Hell, but are also not completely pure as required for entry into Heaven, go through a final process of purification before their full acceptance into Heaven.\n\nEastern Orthodoxy and Protestantism do not believe in Purgatory as such, though the Orthodox Church is willing to allow for a period of continued sanctification (the process of being made pure, or holy) after death. Most Protestants reject the doctrine of Purgatory on the basis that first, Christ has already made full atonement for their sins on the cross, thereby removing all obstacles which prevent them from coming directly into the presence of God after death; and second, it is not found in the [[Protestant Bible]].\n\n==The Great Tribulation==\n{{Main|Great Tribulation}}\n\n===The end comes at an unexpected time===\nThere are many passages in the Bible, both Old and New Testaments, which speak of a time of terrible tribulation such as has never been known, a time of natural and man-made disasters on an awesome scale. Jesus said that at the time of his coming, \"There will be great tribulation, such as has not been since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever will be. And unless those days were shortened, no flesh would be saved; but for the elect's sake, those days will be shortened.\" [Mt 24:21-22]\n\nFurthermore, the [[Messiah]]'s return and the tribulation that accompanies it will come at a time when people are not expecting it:\n\n::Of that day and hour no-one knows; no, not even the angels of heaven, but My Father only. But as the days of Noah were, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. For as in the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, until the flood came and took them all away, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. [Mt 24:36-39]\n\nPaul echoes this theme, saying, \"For when they say, 'Peace and safety!' then sudden destruction comes upon them.\" [1 Thess 5:3]\n\n===The abomination of desolation===\n{{Main|Abomination of desolation}}\nThe abomination of desolation (or desolating sacrilege) is a term found in the [[Hebrew Bible]], in the [[book of Daniel]]. The term is used by [[Jesus Christ]] in the [[Olivet discourse]], according to both the [[Gospel of Matthew]] and the [[Gospel of Mark]]. In the Matthew account, Jesus is presented as quoting Daniel explicitly.\n\n: Matthew 24:15-26 ([[English Standard Version|ESV]]) \"So when you see the abomination of desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.\"\n\n: Mark 13:14 (ESV) \"But when you see the abomination of desolation standing where it ought not to be (let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.\"\n\nThis verse in the Olivet Discourse also occurs in the [[Gospel of Luke]].\n: Luke 21.20-21 (ESV) \"But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation has come near. Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains\u2026\"\n\nMany biblical scholars<ref>{{cite book | last = McNeile | first = A.H. | authorlink = | title = An Introduction to the Study of the New Testament | publisher = University Press | year = 1927 | location = Oxford | pages = Chap.

The key to this understanding is the \"seventy weeks prophecy\" in the book of Daniel. The Prophecy of Seventy Septets (or literally 'seventy times seven') appears in the angel [[Gabriel]]'s reply to Daniel, beginning with verse 22 and ending with verse 27 in the ninth chapter of the [[Book of Daniel]],<ref>Scherman, Rb. (Ed.), 2001, p.1803</ref> a work included in both the [[Jewish]] [[Tanakh]] and the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Bible]]; as well as the [[Septuagint]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/nets/edition/40-daniel-nets.pdf |title=A New English Translation of the Septuagint. 40. Daniel |date= |accessdate=2018-08-15}}</ref> The [[prophecy]] is part of both the [[Jewish]] account of history and Christian eschatology.\n\nThe prophet has a vision of the angel Gabriel, who tells him, \"Seventy weeks are determined for your people and for your holy city (i.e., Israel and Jerusalem).\" [Dan 9:24] After making a comparison with events in the history of Israel, many scholars have concluded that each day in the seventy weeks represents a year. The first sixty-nine weeks are interpreted as covering the period until Christ's first coming, but the last week is thought to represent the years of the tribulation which will come at the end of this age, directly preceding the millennial age of peace:\n\n::The people of the prince who is to come will destroy the city and the sanctuary. The end of it will be with a flood, and till the end of the war, desolations are determined. Then he will confirm a covenant with many for one week. But in the middle of the week, he will bring an end to sacrifice and offering. And on the wing of abominations will be one who makes desolate, even until the consummation which is determined is poured out on the desolate. [Dan 9:26-27]\n\nThis is an obscure prophecy, but in combination with other passages, it has been interpreted to mean that the \"prince who is to come\" will make a seven-year covenant with Israel that will allow the rebuilding of the temple and the reinstitution of sacrifices, but \"in the middle of the week\", he will break the agreement and set up an idol of himself in the temple and force people to worship it\u2014the \"abomination of desolation\". Paul writes:\n\n::Let no-one deceive you by any means, for that day will not come unless the falling away comes first, and the man of sin is revealed, the son of perdition, who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped, so that he sits as God in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God.

And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and bright, for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints.\" [Rev 19:7-8] Christ is represented throughout Revelation as \"the Lamb\", symbolizing the giving of his life as an atoning sacrifice for the people of the world, just as lambs were sacrificed on the altar for the sins of Israel. His \"wife\" appears to represent the people of God, for she is dressed in the \"righteous acts of the saints\". As the marriage takes place, there is a great celebration in heaven which involves a \"great multitude.\" [Rev 19:6]\n\n== Resurrection of the dead ==\n{{Main|Resurrection of the dead#Christianity}}\n{{Original research section|date=April 2015}}\n\n===Doctrine of the resurrection predates Christianity===\nThe word ''resurrection'' comes from the Latin ''resurrectus,'' which is the past participle of ''resurgere,'' meaning ''to rise again.'' Although the doctrine of the resurrection comes to the forefront in the New Testament, it predates the Christian era. There is an apparent reference to the resurrection in the book of Job, where Job says, \"I know that my redeemer lives, and that he will stand at the latter day upon the earth. And though... worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh I will see God.\" [Job 19:25-27] Again, the prophet Daniel writes, \"Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, some to shame and everlasting contempt.\" [Dan 12:2] Isaiah says: \"Your dead will live. Together with my dead body, they will arise. Awake and sing, you who dwell in dust, for your dew is like the dew of herbs, and the earth will cast out the dead\". [Isa. 26:19]\n\nThis belief was still common among the Jews in New Testament times, as exemplified by the passage which relates the raising of Lazarus from the dead. When Jesus told Lazarus' sister, Martha, that Lazarus would rise again, she replied, \"I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.\" [Jn 11:24] Also, one of the two main branches of the Jewish religious establishment, the Pharisees, believed in and taught the future resurrection of the body. [cf Acts 23:1-8]\n\n===Two Resurrections===\n{{main|Resurrection of the dead#Two resurrections of the dead}}\nAn interpretation of the New Testament is the understanding that there will be two resurrections. Revelation says: \"Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection. Over such, the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and will reign with him a thousand years.\" [Rev 20:6] The rest of the dead \"did not live again until the thousand years were finished\". [Rev 20:5]\n\nDespite this, there are various interpretations: \n:According to the premillennial post-tribulational position there will two physical resurrections, separated by a literal thousand years (one in the Second Coming along with the [[Rapture]], another after a literal 1,000 year reign); \n:According to premillennial pre-tribulationists there will be three physical resurrections more (one in the Rapture at the beginning of tribulation, another in the Second Coming at the final of tribulation, the last one after a literal 1,000 year reign), they claim that the ''first resurrection'' includes the resurrection in the Rapture and the resurrection in the Second Coming, the ''second resurrection'' would be after the 1,000 year reign;\n:According to premillennial mid-tribulationists there will be three physical resurrections too (one in the rapture at the middle of tribulation, another in the Second Coming at the finale of tribulation, the last one after a literal 1,000 year reign), the ''first resurrection'' would be the resurrection in the Rapture and the resurrection in the Second Coming, the ''second resurrection'' would be after the 1,000 year reign.\n:According to amillennial position there will be only two resurrections, the ''first resurrection'' would be in a spiritual sense (the resurrection of the soul), according to Paul and John as participation right now, in the resurrection of Christ, through faith and baptism, according to Colossians 2:12 and Colossians 3:1 as occurring within the millennium interpreted as an indefinite period between the foundation of the Church and the Second Coming of Christ, the ''second resurrection'' would be the general resurrection (the resurrection of the body) that would occur at the time of Jesus' return.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/120120.htm The City of God (Book XX)] by St. Augustine Chapter 6.\u2014 What is the First Resurrection, and What the Second.</ref>\n\n===The resurrection body===\nThe Gospel authors wrote that our resurrection bodies will be different from those we have now. Jesus said, \"In the resurrection, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like the angels of God in heaven.\" [Mt 22:30] Paul adds, \"So also is the resurrection of the dead: the body\u2026 is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body.\" [1 Co. 15:42-44]\n\nAccording to the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] the body after resurrection is changed into a spiritual, imperishable body:\n{{quote|[999] Christ is raised with his own body: \"See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself\"; [553] but he did not return to an earthly life. So, in him, \"all of them will rise again with their own bodies which they now bear,\" but Christ \"will change our lowly body to be like his glorious body,\" into a \"spiritual body\" [554]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p123a11.htm|title=CCC - PART 1 SECTION 2 CHAPTER 3 ARTICLE 11|website=www.vatican.va}}</ref>}}\n\nIn some ancient traditions, it was held that the person would be resurrected at the same spot they died and were buried at (just as in the case of Jesus' resurrection). For example, in the early medieval biography of [[St Columba]] written by [[Adomnan of Iona]], Columba at one point prophecies to a penitent at the monastery on [[Iona]] that his resurrection would be in Ireland and not in Iona, and this penitent later died at a monastery in Ireland and was buried there <ref>Adomnan of Iona. Life of St Columba. Penguin books, 1995, p 193</ref>\n\n===Other views===\n\nAlthough [[Martin Luther]] personally believed and taught resurrection of the dead in combination with [[soul sleep]], this is not a mainstream teaching of [[Lutheranism]] and most Lutherans traditionally believe in resurrection of the body in combination with the [[immortal soul]].<ref>Evangelical Lutheran intelligencer: Volume 5 -1830  Page 9 Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Maryland and Virginia \"Every one of those committed to our care is possessed of an immortal soul and should we not exceedingly rejoice, that we in the hands of the Supreme Being, may be instrumental in leading them unto \"fountains of living water.\"</ref>\n\nSeveral churches, such as the [[Anabaptists]] and [[Socinians]] of the Reformation, then [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], [[Christadelphians]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], and theologians of different traditions reject the idea of the immortality of a non-physical soul as a vestige of [[Neoplatonism]], and other [[Paganism|pagan]] traditions. In this school of thought, the dead remain dead (and do not immediately progress to a [[Heaven]], [[Hell]], or [[Purgatory]]) until a physical resurrection of some or all of the dead occurs at the end of time. Some groups, [[Christadelphians]] in particular, consider that it is not a [[universal resurrection]], and that at this time of resurrection that the [[Last Judgment]] will take place.<ref>Ashton, Michael. ''Raised to Judgement Bible Teaching about Resurrection & Judgement'' Christadelphian, Birmingham 1991</ref>\n\n===Armageddon===\n{{Main|Armageddon}}\nMegiddo is mentioned twelve times in the [[Old Testament]], ten times in reference to the ancient city of [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]], and twice with reference to \"the plain of Megiddo\", most probably simply meaning \"the plain next to the city\".<ref name = \"Bible cite\">{{cite web\n| year = 2011\n| url = http://www.biblegateway.com/keyword/?search=megiddo&version1=9&searchtype=all&limit=none&wholewordsonly=no\n| title= Bible Keyword Search Results: megiddo (KJV)\n| accessdate = 2011-01-15}} Listing of the 12 Biblical Old Testament passages containing the word \"Megiddo\".&nbsp; \n</ref> None of these Old Testament passages describes the city of Megiddo as being associated with any particular prophetic beliefs.

Jordan]], [http://www.biblicalhorizons.com/biblical-horizons/no-85-some-observations/ Biblical Horizons, No. 85]</ref> [[R. J. Rushdoony]] says, \"There are no mountains of Megiddo, only the Plains of Megiddo. This is a deliberate destruction of the vision of any literal reference to the place.\"<ref>Rousas John Rushdoony, ''Thy Kingdom Come: Studies in Daniel and Revelation'', 190.</ref> Other scholars, including [[C. C. Torrey]], [[Meredith G. Kline|Kline]] and [[James B. Jordan|Jordan]] argue that the word is derived from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''moed'' ({{lang|he|\u05de\u05d5\u05e2\u05d3|rtl=yes}}), meaning \"assembly\".&nbsp; Thus, \"Armageddon\" would mean \"Mountain of Assembly,\" which Jordan says is \"a reference to the assembly at Mount Sinai, and to its replacement, Mount Zion.\"<ref name=\"Biblical Horizons, No. 85\"/>\n\nThe traditional viewpoint interprets this Bible prophecy to be symbolic of the progression of the world toward the \"great day of God, the Almighty\" in which the great looming mountain of God's just and holy wrath is poured out against unrepentant sinners, led by Satan, in a literal end-of-the-world final confrontation.  Armageddon is the symbolic name given to this event based on scripture references regarding divine obliteration of God's enemies.  The hermeneutical method supports this position by referencing Judges 4 and 5 where God miraculously destroys the enemy of His elect, Israel, at Megiddo, also called the [[Valley of Josaphat]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nChristian scholar [[William Hendriksen]] says:\n{{quote|For this cause, Har Magedon is the symbol of every battle in which, when the need is greatest and believers are oppressed, the Lord suddenly reveals His power in the interest of His distressed people and defeats the enemy.  When Sennacherib's 185,000 are slain by the Angel of Jehovah, that is a shadow of the final Har-Magedon.  When God grants a little handful of Maccabees a glorious victory over an enemy which far outnumbers it, that is a type of Har-Magedon. But the real, the great, the final Har Magedon coincides with the time of Satan\u2019s little season.  Then the world, under the leadership of Satan, anti-Christian government, and anti-Christian religion \u2013 the dragon, the beast, and the false prophet \u2013 is gathered against the Church for the final battle, and the need is greatest; when God's children, oppressed on every side, cry for help; then suddenly, Christ will appear on the clouds of glory to deliver his people; that is Har-Magedon.<ref>[[William Hendriksen]], ''More Than Conquerors'', 163.</ref>}}\n\n==The Millennium==\n{{Main|Millennialism}}\nMillennialism (from [[millennium]], Latin for \"a thousand years\"), or ''chiliasm'' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] equivalent), is the belief that a [[Golden Age]] or [[Paradise]] will occur on [[Earth]] prior to the [[Last judgment|final judgment]] and future eternal state of the \"[[World to Come]]\".\n\nChristian millennialism developed out of a Christian interpretation of Jewish [[apocalypticism]]. Christian millennialist thinking is primarily based upon the Book of Revelation, specifically 20:1-6,{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} which describes the vision of an angel who descended from heaven with a large chain and a key to a bottomless pit, and captured Satan, imprisoning him for a thousand years:\n{{quote|He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years and threw him into the pit and locked and sealed it over him, so that he would deceive the nations no more, until the thousand years were ended. After that, he must be let out for a little while.|Rev. 20:2-3}}\n\nThe Book of Revelation then describes a series of judges who are seated on thrones, as well as his vision of the souls of those who were beheaded for their testimony in favor of Jesus and their rejection of the mark of the beast. These souls:\n{{quote|came to life and reigned with Christ a thousand years. (The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended.) This is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy are those who share in the first resurrection. Over these the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and they will reign with him a thousand years|Rev. 20:4-6}}\n\nThus, Revelation characterizes a millennium where Christ and the Father will rule over a theocracy of the righteous. While there are an abundance of biblical references to such a kingdom of God throughout the Old and New Testaments, this is the only reference in the Bible to such a period lasting one thousand years. The literal belief in a thousand-year reign of Christ is a later development in Christianity, as it does not seem to have been present in first century texts.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n==The End of the World and the Last Judgment==\n\n===Satan released===\nAccording to the Bible, the Millennial age of peace all but closes the history of planet Earth. However, the story is not yet finished: \"When the thousand years have expired, Satan will be released from his prison and will go out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle, whose number is as the sand of the sea.\" [Rev 20:7-8]\n\nThere is continuing discussion over the identity of [[Gog and Magog]]. In the context of the passage, they seem to equate to something like \"east and west\". There is a passage in Ezekiel, however, where God says to the prophet, \"Set your face against Gog, of the land of Magog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal, and prophesy against him.\" [Ezek 38:2] Gog, in this instance, is the name of a person of the land of Magog, who is ruler (\"prince\") over the regions of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal. Ezekiel says of him: \"You will ascend, coming like a storm, covering the land like a cloud, you and all your troops and many peoples with you...\" [Ezek 38:2]\n\nDespite this huge show of force, the battle will be short-lived, for Ezekiel, Daniel, and Revelation all say that this last desperate attempt to destroy the people and the city of God will end in disaster: \"I will bring him to judgment with pestilence and bloodshed. I will rain down on him and on his troops, and on the many peoples who are with him: flooding rain, great hailstones, fire and brimstone.\" [Ezek 38:22] Revelation concurs: \"Fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured them.\" [Rev 20:9] It may be that the images of fire raining down are an ancient vision of modern weapons, others would say a supernatural intervention by God, yet others that they refer to events in history, and some would say they are symbolic of larger ideas and should not be interpreted literally.\n\n===The Last Judgment===\n{{Main|Last Judgment}}\nFollowing the defeat of Gog, the last judgment begins: \"The devil, who deceived them, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are, and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.\" [Rev 20:10] Satan will join the Antichrist and the [[False Prophet]], who were condemned to the lake of fire at the beginning of the Millennium.\n\nFollowing Satan's consignment to the lake of fire, his followers come up for judgment. This is the \"second resurrection\", and all those who were not a part of the first resurrection at the coming of Christ now rise up for judgment:\n\n{{Quote|I saw a great white throne and him who sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away, and there was found no place for them. And the sea gave up the dead who were in it, and Death and Hades delivered up the dead who were in them. And they were judged, each one according to his works. And Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And anyone not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire. [Rev 20:11,13-15]}}\n\nJohn had earlier written, \"Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection. Over such the second death has no power.\" [Rev 20:6] Those who are included in the Resurrection and the Rapture are excluded from the final judgment, and are not subject to the [[second death]]. Due to the description of the seat upon which the Lord sits, this final judgment is often referred to as the [[Great White Throne Judgment]].\n\nA decisive factor in the Last Judgement will be the question, if the corporal [[works of mercy]] were practiced or not during lifetime. They rate as important acts of charity. Therefore, and according to the biblical sources (Mt 5:31-46), the conjunction of the Last Judgement and the [[works of mercy]] is very frequent in the pictorial tradition of Christian art.<ref>[[Ralf van B\u00fchren]], ''[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23753234.2017.1287283 Caravaggio\u2019s \u2018Seven Works of Mercy\u2019 in Naples.

Once again, we see the imagery of the marriage: \"I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.\" [Rev 21:2] In the New Jerusalem, God \"will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God..\" [Rev 21:3] As a result, there is \"no temple in it, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple\". Nor is there a need for the sun to give its light, \"for the glory of God illuminated it, and the Lamb is its light\". [Rev 21:22-23] The city will also be a place of great peace and joy, for \"God will wipe away every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying; and there will be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.\" [Rev 21:4]\n\n====Description====\nThe city itself has a large wall with twelve gates in it which are never shut, and which have the names of the [[twelve tribes of Israel]] written on them. Each of the gates is made of a single pearl, and there is an angel standing in each one. The wall also has twelve foundations which are adorned with precious stones, and upon the foundations are written the names of the twelve apostles. The gates and foundations are often interpreted{{Who|date=June 2011}} as symbolizing the people of God before and after Christ.\n\nThe city and its streets are pure gold, but not like the gold we know, for this gold is described as being like clear glass. The city is square in shape, and is twelve thousand [[furlong]]s long and wide (fifteen hundred miles). If these are comparable to earthly measurements, the city will cover an area about half the size of the contiguous United States. The height is the same as the length and breadth, and although this has led most people to conclude that it is shaped like a cube, it could also be a [[pyramid]].\n\n===The Tree of Life===\n{{Main|Tree of life (biblical)}}\n[[File:Apocalypse 43.

The last time we saw the tree of life was in the Garden of Eden. [Gen 2:9] God drove Adam and Eve out from the garden, guarding it with cherubim and a flaming sword, because it gave eternal life to those who ate of it. [Gen 3:22] In the New Jerusalem, the tree of life reappears, and everyone in the city has access to it. Genesis says that the earth was cursed because of Adam's sin, [Gen 3:17] but the author of John writes that in the New Jerusalem, \"there will be no more curse.\" [Rev 22:3]\n\nThe ''[[Evangelical Dictionary of Theology]]'' (Baker, 1984) says:\n{{quote|The rich symbolism reaches beyond our finest imaginings, not only to the beatific vision but to a renewed, joyous, industrious, orderly, holy, loving, eternal, and abundant existence. Perhaps the most moving element in the description is what is missing: there is no temple in the New Jerusalem, 'because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.' Vastly outstripping the expectations of Judaism, this stated omission signals the ultimate reconciliation.}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Christianity}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[1 Maccabees]]\n* [[2300 day prophecy]]\n* [[Abomination (Bible)]]\n* [[Apocalypticism]]\n* [[Bible prophecy]]\n* [[Christian eschatological views]]\n* [[Christian views on Hades]]\n* [[Consistent eschatology]]\n* [[Daniel Chapter 11]]\n* [[Daniel's Vision of Chapter 8]]\n* [[Day-year principle]]\n* [[End times]]\n* [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]]\n* [[Inaugurated eschatology]]\n* [[Judgment day]]\n* [[Oiketerion]]\n* [[Progressive dispensationalism]]\n* [[Prophecy of Seventy Weeks]]\n* [[Realized eschatology]]\n* [[Third Temple]]\n* [[Whore of Babylon]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Christian theology}}\n{{Theology}}\n{{Global catastrophic risks}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Christian Eschatology}}\n[[Category:Christian eschatology| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{Christian Eschatology|expanded=all}}\n{{Eschatology |Christian}}\n\n'''Christian eschatology''' is a major branch of study within [[Christian theology]] dealing with the \"last things.\" [[Eschatology]], from two Greek words meaning \"last\" (\u1f14\u03c3\u03c7\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2) and \"study\" (-\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1), is the study of 'end things', whether the end of an individual life, the [[End time|end of the age]], the end of the [[Worldly|world]] or the nature of the [[Kingdom of God (Christianity)|Kingdom of God]]. Broadly speaking, Christian eschatology is the study concerned with the ultimate destiny of the individual soul and the entire created order, based primarily upon biblical texts within the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]].\n\nChristian eschatology looks to study and discuss matters such as death and the [[afterlife]], [[Heaven in Christianity|Heaven]] and [[Christian views on Hell|Hell]], the [[second coming]] of Jesus, the [[resurrection of the dead]], the [[rapture]], the [[tribulation]], [[millennialism]], the end of the world, the [[Last Judgment]], and the New Heaven and [[New Earth (Christianity)|New Earth]] in the [[world to come]].\n\nEschatological passages are found in many places in the Bible, both in the [[Old Testament|Old]] and the [[New Testament]]s.

White]], [[William Miller (preacher)]] and [[Joseph Bates (Adventist)]] began to study eschatological implications revealed in the [[Book of Daniel]] and the [[Book of Revelation]]. Their interpretation of Christian eschatology resulted in the founding of the [[Seventh-day Adventist church]].\n\n==Christian eschatological views==\n{{See also|Christian eschatological views}}\nThe following approaches arose from the study of Christianity's most central eschatological document, the [[Book of Revelation]], but the principles embodied in them can be applied to all prophecy in the [[Bible]]. They are by no means mutually exclusive and are often combined to form a more complete and coherent interpretation of prophetic passages. Most interpretations fit into one, or a combination, of these approaches. The alternate methods of prophetic interpretation, [[Futurism (Christianity)|Futurism]] and [[Preterism]] which came from Jesuit writings, were brought about to oppose the [[Historicism]] interpretation which had been used from Biblical times<ref>\"Jesuit scholarship rallied to the Roman cause by providing two plausible alternatives to the historical interpretation of the Protestants. 1. Luis de Alcazar (1554-1630) of Seville, Spain, devised what became known as the 'preterist' system of prophetic interpretation. This theory proposed that the Revelation deals with events in the Pagan Roman Empire, that antichrist refers to Nero and that the prophecies were therefore fulfilled long before the time of the medieval church. Alcazar's preterist system has never made any impact on the conservative, or evangelical wing of the Protestant movement, although in the last one hundred years it has become popular among Protestant rationalists and liberals. 2. A far more successful attack was taken by Francisco Ribera (1537 - 1591) of Salamanca, Spain. He was the founder of the 'futurist' system of prophetic interpretation. Instead of placing antichrist way in the past as did Alcazar, Ribera argues that antichrist would appear way in the future. About 1590 Ribera published a five hundred page commentary on the Apocalypse, denying the Protestant application of antichrist to the church of Rome.\" M.L.

This school of thought interprets the [[Book of Daniel]] as referring to events that happened from the 7th century BC until the first century AD, while seeing the prophecies of [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] as events that happened in the [[Christianity in the 1st century|first century AD]]. Preterism holds that [[Ancient Israel]] finds its [[Supersessionism|continuation or fulfillment]] in the [[Christian church]] at the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70]].\n\nHistorically, preterists and  non-preterists have generally agreed that the Jesuit [[Luis del Alc\u00e1zar|Luis de Alcasar]]  (1554\u20131613) wrote the first systematic preterist exposition of prophecy\u2014''Vestigatio arcani sensus in Apocalypsi'' (published in 1614)\u2014during the [[Counter-Reformation]].\n\n===Historicism===\n[[Historicism]], a method of interpretation of [[Biblical prophecy|Biblical prophecies]], associates [[symbol]]s with historical persons, nations or events.

Historicism===\nExpositors of the traditional Protestant interpretation of Revelation known as [[Historicism (Christian eschatology)|Historicism]] have often maintained that Revelation was written in AD 96 and not [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|AD 70]]. [[Edward Bishop Elliott]], in the ''[[Horae Apocalypticae]]'' (1862), argues that John wrote the book in exile on [[Patmos]] \"at the close of the reign of Domitian; that is near the end of the year 95 or beginning of 96\". He notes that\nDomitian was assassinated in September 96.<ref name = \"ElliottV1\">{{Citation | first = Edward Bishop | last = Elliott | author-link = Edward Bishop Elliott | title = Horae Apocalypticae | publisher = Seely, Jackson and Halliday | place = London | edition = 5th | volume = I | year = 1862| title-link = Horae Apocalypticae }}</ref>{{rp|47}} Elliot begins his lengthy review of historical evidence by quoting [[Irenaeus]], a disciple of [[Polycarp]].

Irenaeus mentions that the Apocalypse was seen \"no very long time ago [but] almost in our own age, toward the end of the reign of Domitian\".<ref name = \"ElliottV1\" />{{rp|32}}\n\nOther historicists have seen no significance in the date that Revelation was written, and have even held to an early date<ref>{{cite book | last =Thomas | first =John | authorlink =John Thomas (Christadelphian) | title = Eureka: An Exposition of the Apocalypse (In Three Volumes) | year =1861 | pages = | url =| title-link =Eureka: An Exposition of the Apocalypse }}</ref> while Kenneth L.

Futurism===\nThe division between these interpretations can be somewhat blurred. \nMost futurists are expecting a [[rapture]] of the Church, an [[antichrist]], a [[Great Tribulation]] and a [[second coming]] of Christ in the near future. But they also accept certain past events, such as the rebirth of the State of [[Israel]] and the reunification of [[Jerusalem]] as prerequisites to them, in a manner which the earlier historicists have done with other dates. Futurists, who do not normally use the [[day-year principle]], interpret the [[Prophecy of Seventy Weeks]] in Daniel 9:24 as years, just as historicists do. Most historicists have chosen timelines, from beginning to end, entirely in the past,<ref>e.g. 312 AD to 1572, 538 AD to 1798, and 606 AD to 1870. See [[day-year principle]]</ref> but some, such as [[Adam Clarke]], have timelines which also commenced with specific past events, but require a future fulfillment. In his commentary on Daniel 8:14 published in 1831, he stated that the 2,300-year period should be calculated from 334 BC, the year [[Alexander the Great]] began his conquest of the Persian Empire.<ref name=\"sacred-texts\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/cmt/clarke/dan.htm|title=Commentary on the Bible by Adam Clarke: Daniel: Daniel index|website=www.sacred-texts.com}}</ref> His calculation resulted in the year 1966. He seems to have overlooked the fact that there is no \"year zero\" between BC and AD dates. For example, the year following 1 BC is 1 AD. Thus his calculations should have required an additional year, ending in 1967. He was not anticipating a literal regathering of the Jewish people prior to the second coming of Christ. But the date is of special significance to futurists since it is the year of Jerusalem's capture by Israeli forces during the [[Six-Day War]].\nHis commentary on Daniel 7:25 contains a 1260-year period commencing in 755 AD and ending in 2015.<ref name=\"sacred-texts\"/>\n\n==Major theological positions==\n\n===Premillennialism===\n{{Main|Premillennialism}}\nStandard premillennialism posits that Christ's second coming will inaugurate a literal thousand-year earthly kingdom. Christ's return will coincide with a time of great tribulation. At this time, there will be a resurrection of the people of God who have died, and a rapture of the people of God who are still living, and they will meet Christ at his coming. A thousand years of peace will follow, during which Christ will reign and Satan will be imprisoned in the Abyss. Those who hold to this view usually fall into one of the following three categories:\n\n====Pretribulation rapture====\n{{Main|Pretribulationism}}\nPretribulationists believe that the second coming will be in two stages separated by a seven-year period of tribulation. At the beginning of the tribulation, true Christians will rise to meet the Lord in the air (the Rapture). Then follows a seven-year period of suffering in which the Antichrist will conquer the world and persecute those who refuse to worship him. At the end of this period, Christ returns to defeat the Antichrist and establish the age of peace. This position is supported by a scripture which says, \"God did not appoint us to wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.\" [1 Thess 5:9]\n\n====Midtribulation rapture====\n{{Main|Midtribulationism}}\nMidtribulationists believe that the Rapture will take place at the halfway point of the seven-year tribulation, i.e. after 3\u00bd years. It coincides with the \"abomination of desolation\"\u2014a desecration of the temple where the Antichrist puts an end to the Jewish sacrifices, sets up his own image in the temple, and demands that he be worshiped as God. This event begins the second, most intense part of the tribulation.\n\nSome interpreters find support for the \"midtrib\" position by comparing a passage in Paul's epistles with the book of Revelation. Paul says, \"We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed\" (1 Cor 15:51-52). Revelation divides the great tribulation into three sets of increasingly catastrophic judgments: the Seven Seals, the Seven Trumpets, and the Seven Bowls, in that order. If the \"last trumpet\" of Paul is equated with the last trumpet of Revelation, the Rapture would be in the middle of the Tribulation. (Not all interpreters agree with this literal interpretation of the chronology of Revelation, however.)\n\n====Posttribulation rapture====\n{{Main|Post-Tribulation Rapture}}\nPosttribulationists hold that Christ will not return until the end of the tribulation. Christians, rather than being raptured at the beginning of the tribulation, or halfway through, will live through it and suffer for their faith during the ascendancy of the Antichrist. Proponents of this position believe that the presence of believers during the tribulation is necessary for a final evangelistic effort during a time when external conditions will combine with the Gospel message to bring great numbers of converts into the Church in time for the beginning of the Millennium.\n\n===Postmillennialism===\n{{Main|Postmillennialism}}\nPostmillennialism is an interpretation of chapter 20 of the [[Book of Revelation]] which sees [[Christ]]'s [[second coming]] as occurring ''after'' the \"[[millennialism|Millennium]]\", a [[Golden Age]] in which [[Christian ethics]] prosper.<ref>David T. Steineker, ''The Greatest Commandment: Matthew 22:37'' (Bloomington, IN: WestBow Press, 2010), 132.</ref> The term subsumes several similar views of the end times, and it stands in contrast to [[premillennialism]] and, to a lesser extent, [[amillennialism]].\n\nPostmillennialism holds that Jesus Christ establishes his kingdom on earth through his preaching and redemptive work in the first century and that he equips his church with the gospel, empowers her by the Spirit, and charges her with the Great Commission (Matt 28:19) to disciple all nations. Postmillennialism expects that eventually the vast majority of people living will be saved. Increasing gospel success will gradually produce a time in history prior to Christ's return in which faith, righteousness, peace, and prosperity will prevail in the affairs of men and of nations. After an extensive era of such conditions Jesus Christ will return visibly, bodily, and gloriously, to end history with the general resurrection and the final judgment after which the eternal order follows.\n\nPostmillenialism was a dominant theological belief among American Protestants who promoted reform movements in the 19th and 20th century such as abolitionism<ref>Randall M. Miller, ''Religion and the American Civil War'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998), 115.</ref> and the [[Social Gospel]].<ref>Douglas M. Strong, ''Perfectionist Politics: Abolitionism and the Religious Tensions of American Democracy'' (Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 2002), 30.</ref> Postmillennialism has become one of the key tenets of a movement known as [[Christian Reconstructionism]]. It has been criticized by 20th century religious conservatives as an attempt to [[immanentize the eschaton]].\n\n===Amillennialism===\n{{Main|Amillennialism}}\nAmillennialism, in Christian eschatology, involves the rejection of the belief that [[Jesus]] will have a literal, thousand-year-long, physical reign on the earth. This rejection contrasts with [[premillennialism|premillennial]] and some [[postmillennialism|postmillennial]] interpretations of [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=rev+20 chapter 20] of the [[Book of Revelation]].\n\nThe amillennial view regards the \"thousand years\" mentioned in Revelation 20 as a [[symbol]]ic number, not as a literal description; amillennialists hold that the [[millennium]] has already begun and is identical with the current [[Dispensation (period)|church age]]. Amillennialism holds that while Christ's reign during the millennium is [[spirit]]ual in nature, at the end of the church age, [[Second Coming of Christ|Christ will return]] in [[last judgment|final judgment]] and establish a permanent reign in the new heaven and new earth.\n\nMany proponents dislike the name \"amillennialism\" because it emphasizes their differences with premillennialism rather than their beliefs about the millennium. \"Amillennial\" was actually coined in a pejorative way by those who hold premillennial views. Some proponents also prefer alternate terms such as ''nunc-millennialism'' (that is, now-millennialism) or ''realized millennialism'', although these other names have achieved only limited acceptance and usage.<ref>Anthony Hoekema, [http://www.the-highway.com/amila_Hoekema.html \"Amillennialism\"]</ref>\n\n==Death and the afterlife==\n\n===Jewish beliefs at the time of Jesus===\n{{see also|Second Temple Judaism}}\nThere were different schools of thought on the afterlife in [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]] during the first century AD. The [[Sadducees]], who recognized only the [[Torah]] (first five books of the Old Testament) as authoritative, did not believe in an afterlife or any resurrection of the dead. The [[Pharisees]], who not only accepted the Torah, but [[Development of the Hebrew Bible canon|additional scriptures as well]], believed in the [[Resurrection of the Dead#Judaism|resurrection of the dead]], and it is known to have been a major point of contention between the two groups (see {{bibleverse||Acts|23:8}}). The Pharisees based their belief on passages such as {{bibleverse||Daniel|12:2}}, which says: \"Multitudes who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake: some to everlasting life, others to shame and everlasting contempt.\"\n\n===The intermediate state===\n{{main|Intermediate state}}\nSome traditions (notably the Seventh-day Adventists) teach that the [[soul sleep]]s after death, and will not awake again until the [[resurrection of the dead]], while others believe the spirit goes to an intermediate place where it will live consciously until the resurrection of the dead. By \"soul\", Seventh-day Adventists theologians mean the physical person (monism), and that no component of human nature survives death; therefore, each human will be \"recreated\" at resurrection. The biblical [[Book of Ezekiel]] provides substantiation for the assertion that souls experience mortality, \u201cBehold, all souls are Mine; The soul of the father As well as the soul of the son is Mine; The soul who sins shall die.\" (Ezekiel 18:4) <ref>{{cite web|title=Ezekiel 18:4|url=https://biblia.com/books/nkjv/Eze18.4|website=Biblia.com|publisher=Faithlife.com|accessdate=8 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' says:\n:Each man receives his eternal retribution in his [[immortal soul]] at the very moment of his death, in a [[particular judgment]] that refers his life to Christ: either entrance into the blessedness of [[Heaven (Christianity)|heaven]]\u2014through a [[Purgatory|purification]] or immediately\u2014or immediate and everlasting [[damnation]]. (Sect. 1022)\n\n===Purgatory===\n{{main|Purgatory}}\nSome denominations (a notable exception are [[Seventh-day Adventists]]) affirm the statement from the ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' (above), with the exception of the parenthetical phrase, \"through a purification or immediately\". This alludes to the Catholic belief in a spiritual state, known as Purgatory, in which those souls who are not condemned to Hell, but are also not completely pure as required for entry into Heaven, go through a final process of purification before their full acceptance into Heaven.\n\nEastern Orthodoxy and Protestantism do not believe in Purgatory as such, though the Orthodox Church is willing to allow for a period of continued sanctification (the process of being made pure, or holy) after death. Most Protestants reject the doctrine of Purgatory on the basis that first, Christ has already made full atonement for their sins on the cross, thereby removing all obstacles which prevent them from coming directly into the presence of God after death; and second, it is not found in the [[Protestant Bible]].\n\n==The Great Tribulation==\n{{Main|Great Tribulation}}\n\n===The end comes at an unexpected time===\nThere are many passages in the Bible, both Old and New Testaments, which speak of a time of terrible tribulation such as has never been known, a time of natural and man-made disasters on an awesome scale. Jesus said that at the time of his coming, \"There will be great tribulation, such as has not been since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever will be. And unless those days were shortened, no flesh would be saved; but for the elect's sake, those days will be shortened.\" [Mt 24:21-22]\n\nFurthermore, the [[Messiah]]'s return and the tribulation that accompanies it will come at a time when people are not expecting it:\n\n::Of that day and hour no-one knows; no, not even the angels of heaven, but My Father only. But as the days of Noah were, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. For as in the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, until the flood came and took them all away, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. [Mt 24:36-39]\n\nPaul echoes this theme, saying, \"For when they say, 'Peace and safety!' then sudden destruction comes upon them.\" [1 Thess 5:3]\n\n===The abomination of desolation===\n{{Main|Abomination of desolation}}\nThe abomination of desolation (or desolating sacrilege) is a term found in the [[Hebrew Bible]], in the [[book of Daniel]]. The term is used by [[Jesus Christ]] in the [[Olivet discourse]], according to both the [[Gospel of Matthew]] and the [[Gospel of Mark]]. In the Matthew account, Jesus is presented as quoting Daniel explicitly.\n\n: Matthew 24:15-26 ([[English Standard Version|ESV]]) \"So when you see the abomination of desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.\"\n\n: Mark 13:14 (ESV) \"But when you see the abomination of desolation standing where it ought not to be (let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.\"\n\nThis verse in the Olivet Discourse also occurs in the [[Gospel of Luke]].\n: Luke 21.20-21 (ESV) \"But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation has come near.

The key to this understanding is the \"seventy weeks prophecy\" in the book of Daniel. The Prophecy of Seventy Septets (or literally 'seventy times seven') appears in the angel [[Gabriel]]'s reply to Daniel, beginning with verse 22 and ending with verse 27 in the ninth chapter of the [[Book of Daniel]],<ref>Scherman, Rb. (Ed.), 2001, p.1803</ref> a work included in both the [[Jewish]] [[Tanakh]] and the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Bible]]; as well as the [[Septuagint]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/nets/edition/40-daniel-nets.pdf |title=A New English Translation of the Septuagint. 40. Daniel |date= |accessdate=2018-08-15}}</ref> The [[prophecy]] is part of both the [[Jewish]] account of history and Christian eschatology.\n\nThe prophet has a vision of the angel Gabriel, who tells him, \"Seventy weeks are determined for your people and for your holy city (i.e., Israel and Jerusalem).\" [Dan 9:24] After making a comparison with events in the history of Israel, many scholars have concluded that each day in the seventy weeks represents a year. The first sixty-nine weeks are interpreted as covering the period until Christ's first coming, but the last week is thought to represent the years of the tribulation which will come at the end of this age, directly preceding the millennial age of peace:\n\n::The people of the prince who is to come will destroy the city and the sanctuary. The end of it will be with a flood, and till the end of the war, desolations are determined. Then he will confirm a covenant with many for one week. But in the middle of the week, he will bring an end to sacrifice and offering. And on the wing of abominations will be one who makes desolate, even until the consummation which is determined is poured out on the desolate. [Dan 9:26-27]\n\nThis is an obscure prophecy, but in combination with other passages, it has been interpreted to mean that the \"prince who is to come\" will make a seven-year covenant with Israel that will allow the rebuilding of the temple and the reinstitution of sacrifices, but \"in the middle of the week\", he will break the agreement and set up an idol of himself in the temple and force people to worship it\u2014the \"abomination of desolation\". Paul writes:\n\n::Let no-one deceive you by any means, for that day will not come unless the falling away comes first, and the man of sin is revealed, the son of perdition, who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped, so that he sits as God in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God. [2 Thess 2:3-4]\n\n== Rapture ==\n{{Main|Rapture}}\nThe rapture is an eschatological term used by certain Christians, particularly within branches of North American [[evangelicalism]], referring to an [[end time]] event when all [[Christians|Christian]] believers \u2013 living and dead \u2013 will rise into Heaven and join [[Jesus|Christ]].<ref name=\"McKim2014\">{{cite book|last=McKim|first=Donald K|title=The Westminster Dictionary of Theological Terms, Second Edition: Revised and Expanded|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dEaTAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA261|accessdate=26 December 2014|date=2014-04-09|publisher=Presbyterian Publishing Corporation|isbn=9781611643862|pages=261\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Oldman\">{{cite book|last1=Chopra|first1=editor, Ramesh|title=Encyclopaedic dictionary of religion: Q-Z|date=2005|publisher=Isha Books|location=Delhi|isbn=978-81-8205-203-1|pages=638|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KakgvDxdbXwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Encyclopaedic+Dictionary+of+Religion:+Q-Z#v=onepage&q=rapture&f=false|accessdate=6 April 2015}}</ref> Some adherents believe this event is predicted and described in Paul's [[First Epistle to the Thessalonians]] in the [[Bible]],<ref>{{bibleref2|1 Thessalonians|4:17|NASB}}</ref> where he uses the Greek ''harpazo'' (\u1f01\u03c1\u03c0\u03ac\u03b6\u03c9), meaning to snatch away or seize.

And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and bright, for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints.\" [Rev 19:7-8] Christ is represented throughout Revelation as \"the Lamb\", symbolizing the giving of his life as an atoning sacrifice for the people of the world, just as lambs were sacrificed on the altar for the sins of Israel. His \"wife\" appears to represent the people of God, for she is dressed in the \"righteous acts of the saints\". As the marriage takes place, there is a great celebration in heaven which involves a \"great multitude.\" [Rev 19:6]\n\n== Resurrection of the dead ==\n{{Main|Resurrection of the dead#Christianity}}\n{{Original research section|date=April 2015}}\n\n===Doctrine of the resurrection predates Christianity===\nThe word ''resurrection'' comes from the Latin ''resurrectus,'' which is the past participle of ''resurgere,'' meaning ''to rise again.'' Although the doctrine of the resurrection comes to the forefront in the New Testament, it predates the Christian era. There is an apparent reference to the resurrection in the book of Job, where Job says, \"I know that my redeemer lives, and that he will stand at the latter day upon the earth. And though... worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh I will see God.\" [Job 19:25-27] Again, the prophet Daniel writes, \"Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, some to shame and everlasting contempt.\" [Dan 12:2] Isaiah says: \"Your dead will live. Together with my dead body, they will arise. Awake and sing, you who dwell in dust, for your dew is like the dew of herbs, and the earth will cast out the dead\". [Isa. 26:19]\n\nThis belief was still common among the Jews in New Testament times, as exemplified by the passage which relates the raising of Lazarus from the dead. When Jesus told Lazarus' sister, Martha, that Lazarus would rise again, she replied, \"I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.\" [Jn 11:24] Also, one of the two main branches of the Jewish religious establishment, the Pharisees, believed in and taught the future resurrection of the body. [cf Acts 23:1-8]\n\n===Two Resurrections===\n{{main|Resurrection of the dead#Two resurrections of the dead}}\nAn interpretation of the New Testament is the understanding that there will be two resurrections. Revelation says: \"Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection. Over such, the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and will reign with him a thousand years.\" [Rev 20:6] The rest of the dead \"did not live again until the thousand years were finished\". [Rev 20:5]\n\nDespite this, there are various interpretations: \n:According to the premillennial post-tribulational position there will two physical resurrections, separated by a literal thousand years (one in the Second Coming along with the [[Rapture]], another after a literal 1,000 year reign); \n:According to premillennial pre-tribulationists there will be three physical resurrections more (one in the Rapture at the beginning of tribulation, another in the Second Coming at the final of tribulation, the last one after a literal 1,000 year reign), they claim that the ''first resurrection'' includes the resurrection in the Rapture and the resurrection in the Second Coming, the ''second resurrection'' would be after the 1,000 year reign;\n:According to premillennial mid-tribulationists there will be three physical resurrections too (one in the rapture at the middle of tribulation, another in the Second Coming at the finale of tribulation, the last one after a literal 1,000 year reign), the ''first resurrection'' would be the resurrection in the Rapture and the resurrection in the Second Coming, the ''second resurrection'' would be after the 1,000 year reign.\n:According to amillennial position there will be only two resurrections, the ''first resurrection'' would be in a spiritual sense (the resurrection of the soul), according to Paul and John as participation right now, in the resurrection of Christ, through faith and baptism, according to Colossians 2:12 and Colossians 3:1 as occurring within the millennium interpreted as an indefinite period between the foundation of the Church and the Second Coming of Christ, the ''second resurrection'' would be the general resurrection (the resurrection of the body) that would occur at the time of Jesus' return.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/120120.htm The City of God (Book XX)] by St. Augustine Chapter 6.\u2014 What is the First Resurrection, and What the Second.</ref>\n\n===The resurrection body===\nThe Gospel authors wrote that our resurrection bodies will be different from those we have now. Jesus said, \"In the resurrection, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like the angels of God in heaven.\" [Mt 22:30] Paul adds, \"So also is the resurrection of the dead: the body\u2026 is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body.\" [1 Co. 15:42-44]\n\nAccording to the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] the body after resurrection is changed into a spiritual, imperishable body:\n{{quote|[999] Christ is raised with his own body: \"See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself\"; [553] but he did not return to an earthly life. So, in him, \"all of them will rise again with their own bodies which they now bear,\" but Christ \"will change our lowly body to be like his glorious body,\" into a \"spiritual body\" [554]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p123a11.htm|title=CCC - PART 1 SECTION 2 CHAPTER 3 ARTICLE 11|website=www.vatican.va}}</ref>}}\n\nIn some ancient traditions, it was held that the person would be resurrected at the same spot they died and were buried at (just as in the case of Jesus' resurrection). For example, in the early medieval biography of [[St Columba]] written by [[Adomnan of Iona]], Columba at one point prophecies to a penitent at the monastery on [[Iona]] that his resurrection would be in Ireland and not in Iona, and this penitent later died at a monastery in Ireland and was buried there <ref>Adomnan of Iona.

In this school of thought, the dead remain dead (and do not immediately progress to a [[Heaven]], [[Hell]], or [[Purgatory]]) until a physical resurrection of some or all of the dead occurs at the end of time. Some groups, [[Christadelphians]] in particular, consider that it is not a [[universal resurrection]], and that at this time of resurrection that the [[Last Judgment]] will take place.<ref>Ashton, Michael.

The one [[New Testament]] reference to the city of Armageddon found in {{bibleref2|Revelation|16:16}} also makes no specific mention of any armies being predicted to one day gather in this city, but instead seems to predict only that \"they (will gather) the kings together to ....

Jordan]], [http://www.biblicalhorizons.com/biblical-horizons/no-85-some-observations/ Biblical Horizons, No. 85]</ref> [[R. J. Rushdoony]] says, \"There are no mountains of Megiddo, only the Plains of Megiddo. This is a deliberate destruction of the vision of any literal reference to the place.\"<ref>Rousas John Rushdoony, ''Thy Kingdom Come: Studies in Daniel and Revelation'', 190.</ref> Other scholars, including [[C. C. Torrey]], [[Meredith G. Kline|Kline]] and [[James B. Jordan|Jordan]] argue that the word is derived from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''moed'' ({{lang|he|\u05de\u05d5\u05e2\u05d3|rtl=yes}}), meaning \"assembly\".&nbsp; Thus, \"Armageddon\" would mean \"Mountain of Assembly,\" which Jordan says is \"a reference to the assembly at Mount Sinai, and to its replacement, Mount Zion.\"<ref name=\"Biblical Horizons, No. 85\"/>\n\nThe traditional viewpoint interprets this Bible prophecy to be symbolic of the progression of the world toward the \"great day of God, the Almighty\" in which the great looming mountain of God's just and holy wrath is poured out against unrepentant sinners, led by Satan, in a literal end-of-the-world final confrontation.  Armageddon is the symbolic name given to this event based on scripture references regarding divine obliteration of God's enemies.  The hermeneutical method supports this position by referencing Judges 4 and 5 where God miraculously destroys the enemy of His elect, Israel, at Megiddo, also called the [[Valley of Josaphat]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nChristian scholar [[William Hendriksen]] says:\n{{quote|For this cause, Har Magedon is the symbol of every battle in which, when the need is greatest and believers are oppressed, the Lord suddenly reveals His power in the interest of His distressed people and defeats the enemy.  When Sennacherib's 185,000 are slain by the Angel of Jehovah, that is a shadow of the final Har-Magedon.  When God grants a little handful of Maccabees a glorious victory over an enemy which far outnumbers it, that is a type of Har-Magedon. But the real, the great, the final Har Magedon coincides with the time of Satan\u2019s little season.  Then the world, under the leadership of Satan, anti-Christian government, and anti-Christian religion \u2013 the dragon, the beast, and the false prophet \u2013 is gathered against the Church for the final battle, and the need is greatest; when God's children, oppressed on every side, cry for help; then suddenly, Christ will appear on the clouds of glory to deliver his people; that is Har-Magedon.<ref>[[William Hendriksen]], ''More Than Conquerors'', 163.</ref>}}\n\n==The Millennium==\n{{Main|Millennialism}}\nMillennialism (from [[millennium]], Latin for \"a thousand years\"), or ''chiliasm'' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] equivalent), is the belief that a [[Golden Age]] or [[Paradise]] will occur on [[Earth]] prior to the [[Last judgment|final judgment]] and future eternal state of the \"[[World to Come]]\".\n\nChristian millennialism developed out of a Christian interpretation of Jewish [[apocalypticism]]. Christian millennialist thinking is primarily based upon the Book of Revelation, specifically 20:1-6,{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} which describes the vision of an angel who descended from heaven with a large chain and a key to a bottomless pit, and captured Satan, imprisoning him for a thousand years:\n{{quote|He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years and threw him into the pit and locked and sealed it over him, so that he would deceive the nations no more, until the thousand years were ended. After that, he must be let out for a little while.|Rev. 20:2-3}}\n\nThe Book of Revelation then describes a series of judges who are seated on thrones, as well as his vision of the souls of those who were beheaded for their testimony in favor of Jesus and their rejection of the mark of the beast. These souls:\n{{quote|came to life and reigned with Christ a thousand years. (The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended.) This is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy are those who share in the first resurrection. Over these the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and they will reign with him a thousand years|Rev. 20:4-6}}\n\nThus, Revelation characterizes a millennium where Christ and the Father will rule over a theocracy of the righteous. While there are an abundance of biblical references to such a kingdom of God throughout the Old and New Testaments, this is the only reference in the Bible to such a period lasting one thousand years. The literal belief in a thousand-year reign of Christ is a later development in Christianity, as it does not seem to have been present in first century texts.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n==The End of the World and the Last Judgment==\n\n===Satan released===\nAccording to the Bible, the Millennial age of peace all but closes the history of planet Earth. However, the story is not yet finished: \"When the thousand years have expired, Satan will be released from his prison and will go out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle, whose number is as the sand of the sea.\" [Rev 20:7-8]\n\nThere is continuing discussion over the identity of [[Gog and Magog]]. In the context of the passage, they seem to equate to something like \"east and west\". There is a passage in Ezekiel, however, where God says to the prophet, \"Set your face against Gog, of the land of Magog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal, and prophesy against him.\" [Ezek 38:2] Gog, in this instance, is the name of a person of the land of Magog, who is ruler (\"prince\") over the regions of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal. Ezekiel says of him: \"You will ascend, coming like a storm, covering the land like a cloud, you and all your troops and many peoples with you...\" [Ezek 38:2]\n\nDespite this huge show of force, the battle will be short-lived, for Ezekiel, Daniel, and Revelation all say that this last desperate attempt to destroy the people and the city of God will end in disaster: \"I will bring him to judgment with pestilence and bloodshed. I will rain down on him and on his troops, and on the many peoples who are with him: flooding rain, great hailstones, fire and brimstone.\" [Ezek 38:22] Revelation concurs: \"Fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured them.\" [Rev 20:9] It may be that the images of fire raining down are an ancient vision of modern weapons, others would say a supernatural intervention by God, yet others that they refer to events in history, and some would say they are symbolic of larger ideas and should not be interpreted literally.\n\n===The Last Judgment===\n{{Main|Last Judgment}}\nFollowing the defeat of Gog, the last judgment begins: \"The devil, who deceived them, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are, and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.\" [Rev 20:10] Satan will join the Antichrist and the [[False Prophet]], who were condemned to the lake of fire at the beginning of the Millennium.\n\nFollowing Satan's consignment to the lake of fire, his followers come up for judgment. This is the \"second resurrection\", and all those who were not a part of the first resurrection at the coming of Christ now rise up for judgment:\n\n{{Quote|I saw a great white throne and him who sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away, and there was found no place for them. And the sea gave up the dead who were in it, and Death and Hades delivered up the dead who were in them. And they were judged, each one according to his works. And Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And anyone not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire. [Rev 20:11,13-15]}}\n\nJohn had earlier written, \"Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection. Over such the second death has no power.\" [Rev 20:6] Those who are included in the Resurrection and the Rapture are excluded from the final judgment, and are not subject to the [[second death]]. Due to the description of the seat upon which the Lord sits, this final judgment is often referred to as the [[Great White Throne Judgment]].\n\nA decisive factor in the Last Judgement will be the question, if the corporal [[works of mercy]] were practiced or not during lifetime. They rate as important acts of charity. Therefore, and according to the biblical sources (Mt 5:31-46), the conjunction of the Last Judgement and the [[works of mercy]] is very frequent in the pictorial tradition of Christian art.<ref>[[Ralf van B\u00fchren]], ''[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23753234.2017.1287283 Caravaggio\u2019s \u2018Seven Works of Mercy\u2019 in Naples.

Once again, we see the imagery of the marriage: \"I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.\" [Rev 21:2] In the New Jerusalem, God \"will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God..\" [Rev 21:3] As a result, there is \"no temple in it, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple\". Nor is there a need for the sun to give its light, \"for the glory of God illuminated it, and the Lamb is its light\". [Rev 21:22-23] The city will also be a place of great peace and joy, for \"God will wipe away every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying; and there will be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.\" [Rev 21:4]\n\n====Description====\nThe city itself has a large wall with twelve gates in it which are never shut, and which have the names of the [[twelve tribes of Israel]] written on them. Each of the gates is made of a single pearl, and there is an angel standing in each one. The wall also has twelve foundations which are adorned with precious stones, and upon the foundations are written the names of the twelve apostles. The gates and foundations are often interpreted{{Who|date=June 2011}} as symbolizing the people of God before and after Christ.\n\nThe city and its streets are pure gold, but not like the gold we know, for this gold is described as being like clear glass. The city is square in shape, and is twelve thousand [[furlong]]s long and wide (fifteen hundred miles). If these are comparable to earthly measurements, the city will cover an area about half the size of the contiguous United States. The height is the same as the length and breadth, and although this has led most people to conclude that it is shaped like a cube, it could also be a [[pyramid]].\n\n===The Tree of Life===\n{{Main|Tree of life (biblical)}}\n[[File:Apocalypse 43.

The last time we saw the tree of life was in the Garden of Eden. [Gen 2:9] God drove Adam and Eve out from the garden, guarding it with cherubim and a flaming sword, because it gave eternal life to those who ate of it. [Gen 3:22] In the New Jerusalem, the tree of life reappears, and everyone in the city has access to it. Genesis says that the earth was cursed because of Adam's sin, [Gen 3:17] but the author of John writes that in the New Jerusalem, \"there will be no more curse.\" [Rev 22:3]\n\nThe ''[[Evangelical Dictionary of Theology]]'' (Baker, 1984) says:\n{{quote|The rich symbolism reaches beyond our finest imaginings, not only to the beatific vision but to a renewed, joyous, industrious, orderly, holy, loving, eternal, and abundant existence.

They would support the heavier first class in the front ranks. It is probable that engagements with the [[Samnites]] and a crushing defeat at the hands of the [[Gauls|Gallic]] warlord [[Brennus]], who both used lots of smaller military units rather than a few very large ones, taught the Romans the importance of flexibility and the inadequacy of the phalanx on the rough, hilly ground of central Italy.<ref name=\"Book1-29\">{{cite book|last=Penrose|first=Jane  |title=Rome and Her Enemies: An Empire Created and Destroyed by War|publisher=Osprey Publishing|pages=29 |isbn=1-84176-932-0 |year=2005}}</ref><ref name=\"Book2-88\">{{cite book|last=Southern|first=Pat|title=The Roman Army: A Social and Institutional History|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=[https://archive.org/details/romanarmysociali00sout_0/page/88 88]|isbn=0-19-532878-7|year=2007|url=https://archive.org/details/romanarmysociali00sout_0/page/88}}</ref>\n\n===Camillan system===\nIn the early [[Structural history of the Roman military#Manipular legion (509 BC \u2013 107 BC)|Camillan system]] of organisation of the 3rd and 4th centuries BC, men were sorted into classes based on wealth, the ''principes'' being the wealthiest after the ''[[triarii]]''.<ref name=\"Book3-495\">{{cite book|last=Smith|first=William |title=A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities|publisher=Little, Brown, and Co.|pages=495 |isbn=0-89341-166-3 |year=1859}}</ref> ''Principes'' were armed with short spears, or [[hasta (spear)|''hastae'']], up to 1.8&nbsp;metres (6&nbsp;ft) long.<ref name=\"Book3-172\">{{cite book|last=Smith|first=William |title=A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities|publisher=Little, Brown, and Co.|pages=172 |isbn=0-89341-166-3 |year=1859}}</ref> They fought in a [[quincunx]] formation, usually carrying [[scutum (shield)|''scuta'']], large rectangular shields, and bronze [[helmet]]s, often with a number of feathers fixed onto the top to increase stature.
