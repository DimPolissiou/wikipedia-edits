The film was directed by [[James Foley (director)|James Foley]] and stars [[Gene Hackman]] and [[Chris O'Donnell]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:MississippiStatePen.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mississippi State Penitentiary]], the setting of the film]]\n\nIn April 1967, the office of Marvin Kramer, a [[Jews|Jewish]] [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] [[lawyer]] in [[Indianola, Mississippi]], is bombed by the [[Ku Klux Klan]], killing Kramer's five-year-old twin boys and leading to the amputation of Kramer's legs and his later suicide.  Klansman Sam Cayhall (Hackman) is tried for murder in the bombing, and is eventually convicted and [[capital punishment in the United States|sentenced to die]] in the [[gas chamber]] at the [[Mississippi State Penitentiary]].  Twenty-nine years later, in 1996, Adam Hall (O\u2019Donnell), a young attorney at the [[Chicago]] [[law firm]] of Kravitz and Bane, seeks assignment to the firm's [[pro bono]] representation of Cayhall in the last weeks before his scheduled execution.  Adam is Sam Cayhall's grandson, his family having since moved away from [[Southern United States|the South]] and changed their name, haunted and shamed by Cayhall's crime.  Adam is motivated to take the case in a search for some understanding of the dark secrets of his family, which prompted the suicide of Adam's father the year Sam was sentenced to death (and whose body Adam found as a child).\n\nAdam is sent by the firm to [[Jackson, Mississippi]] to take over the case and there reconnects with his aunt Lee Bowen (Dunaway), an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] [[socialite]] who has managed to avoid public association with her infamous father, and who warns Adam about the dangers of dredging up the past.  On [[death row]], Sam remains a brusque, bitter, unrepentant racist who brags about his participation in the Klan bombing campaign of which the Kramer bombing was a part, though he denies that any of the bombings were intended to kill.  He taunts Adam for his youth, legal inexperience, anti-racism, and the suicide of his father, but he agrees to allow Adam to represent him, though he forbids Adam from seeking [[pardon|clemency]] from Mississippi Governor McAllister, who had prosecuted Sam in his last retrial and had campaigned on that prosecution in his election to Governor.  Nevertheless, as he begins to argue the case, Adam is approached by the Governor through an aide, Nora Stark (Rochon), who suggests that the Governor might consider clemency if Sam provides information about unidentified co-conspirators to the bombing.\n\nAs Adam investigates, inconsistencies in the facts of the original case come to light, casting doubt on Sam's intent to kill and suggesting that he lacked the ability to make the bomb himself, and both Stark and the original [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent who investigated the case indicate that the bombing may have been the result of a broader conspiracy involving the [[Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission]] and [[Citizens' Councils|White Citizens' Councils]], which were active at the time of the bombing in opposition to civil rights.  Sam refuses to authorize Adam to seek access to the Sovereignty Commission's files, sealed by order of the [[Mississippi Legislature|state legislature]], fearing it would expose Sam's former associates in the Klan, as well allowing the Governor to obtain useful information on political enemies, which he indicates is the Governor's real reason for seeking Sam's cooperation in unsealing the files.\n\nAdam continues to work through the courts, filing and arguing motions for a [[stay of execution]], including on the grounds that Sam was [[insanity defense|legally insane and unable to tell right from wrong]], due to his indoctrination into the Ku Klux Klan.  At the same time, Lee, faced with the unearthed ghosts of the family history and having lapsed back into full-blown alcoholism, reveals to Adam that in the early 1950s, as children, she and Adam's father had witnessed their father murder the family's African-American neighbor, Joe Lincoln, during a fight that had started because Adam's father, Eddie, had wrongly accused Lincoln's son of stealing a toy soldier.  Eddie had blamed himself for the murder, as well as Lee, for failing to stop Sam, the guilt of which was a factor in Eddie's later suicide and Lee's alcoholism.  Lee also reveals how their father had been indoctrinated into the Klan as a child, showing Adam a historic photograph of Sam as a young boy attending a Klan [[Lynching_in_the_United_States|lynching]] (which Adam uses in his arguments before the courts).\n\nAdam and Nora secretly gain access to the Sovereignty Commission's sealed files, which prove a wider conspiracy to the bombing, and also indicate the participation of an accomplice.  The former FBI agent resurfaces, and reveals to Adam that the FBI had identified the accomplice, Rollie Wedge, whom the FBI had never been able to prove responsible, but who has reunited with other Klan members to commemorate the bombing on the eve of the pending execution.  Adam goes to the Klan reunion and is beaten by several Klan members, and threatened at gunpoint by Wedge.\n\nAdam's persistence, the revelation of how much Sam's hatred had destroyed his family, and his impending execution begin to affect Sam, and he softens, reconciling with Lee and expressing remorse for his actions and the effect they have had on his family.  Sam forcefully rejects the Klan when Wedge visits him in prison to encourage him to remain silent, and it is revealed that Wedge was the one who had built the bomb and set it deliberately to kill.  Ultimately, Adam's motions for a stay are denied by the courts, including the [[Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States|United States Supreme Court]]. Despite Sam's finally authorizing the release of relevant Sovereignty Commission files, the Governor refuses to grant clemency, betraying him and Adam, while nonetheless using the files as political leverage (as Sam had predicted), though Wedge, identified in the files, is finally arrested.  Ultimately, Sam is executed in the gas chamber, though Adam remains a confidant and advocate for his grandfather up until his execution, and he and Lee embrace at the end, in the hope that maybe the ghosts of the past are gone.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Chris O'Donnell]] as Adam Hall \n* [[Gene Hackman]] as Sam Cayhall \n* [[Faye Dunaway]] as Lee Cayhall Bowen \n* [[Robert Prosky]] as E.

Blood flow is usually interrupted in the procedure, increasing the risk of the patient losing a limb.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Riggins|first=Christie|date=Fall 2000|title=Great inventions don't happen overnight: development of the Fogarty balloon catheter|url=http://sm.stanford.edu/archive/stanmed/2000fall/inventions.html|journal=Stanford Medicine|volume= 17| issue =  3|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nAt home, the ideas that went through Fogarty's head concerned different ways of making the procedure better, and he especially concentrated on avoiding the risky incisions. He tinkered with a [[urethra]]l [[catheter]] and a balloon in his attic. Because a catheter only required a small incision, it would be able to get to the clot without much trauma to the patient. The urethral catheter is also flexible yet strong enough to be pushed through a blood clot. As for the balloon, he basically cut off the tip of the pinky finger of a size 5 surgical [[latex glove]] and attempted to incorporate it onto the end of the catheter.<ref name=\":3\" /> The resulting balloon could be inflated with [[Saline (medicine)|saline]] using a [[syringe]], and once it expands to the size of the artery, it is then retracted, withdrawing the clot through the artery and out the incision.\n\nThe main problem in building this device was the way the balloon could be attached to the catheter. Glue that could hold [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]], the material making up a catheter, and latex, the type of glove used, was not available. Fogarty's own take on the catheter came about because of fishing techniques he learned as a child. Precise hand-tying was needed in fishing, and with these techniques, he tied the balloon to the catheter. \"I'd always tied flies and made lures so it was just a natural thing.\"<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> His experimental balloon catheter, however, always seemed to burst when it was over inflated. It even broke when he dragged it through glass tubes filled with [[Jell-o]], a model he thought simulated a clot within an artery. After some time, he figured out the type and thickness of rubber that was firm enough when inflated to extract a clot and still flexible enough to move through without breaking. The device, made before Fogarty even received his MD from University of Cincinnati in 1960, became the first [[minimally invasive]] surgical device.\n\nFogarty, however, came across difficulties in getting a manufacturer to produce it. From 1959 to 1961, nobody was willing to help. \"Companies thought I was some stooge fooling around. I didn't have any credibility.\"<ref name=\":5\" />  Dr. Cranley continued to encourage him, and soon, during his fellowship training at the University of Cincinnati in 1961 and 1962, Fogarty started to make the catheter system by hand for himself and for other vascular surgeons.\n\nAt the University of Oregon, while Fogarty was completing his residency in surgery, Dr. Al Starr, head of the cardiothoracic division, used Fogarty's balloon catheters. After he was informed that no company was willing to manufacture Fogarty's device, he asked one of his acquaintances, Lowell Edwards, an electrical engineer and president of his own company, to give the device consideration in producing it. In 1969, Fogarty patented his device, and Edwards Life Sciences from [[Irvine, California]], was assigned the patent to begin manufacturing the Fogarty embolectomy catheter.\n\nBecause of the decreased risk associated with the device, Fogarty's balloon catheter became the industry standard and remains the most widely used catheter for blood-clot removal. Before his invention the success rate for removing an embolus, or blood clot, was forty to fifty percent. The balloon catheter is now used in over three hundred thousand procedures every year all over the world, and is estimated to have saved the lives and limbs of approximately twenty million patients.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalmedals.org/laureates/thomas-j-fogarty|title=Thomas J. Fogarty. 2012 National Medal of Technology and Innovation, Medicine|website=National Science & Technology Medals Foundation|access-date=January 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Other inventions ==\n\nNumerous sequel applications of Fogarty's catheter came about. The first balloon [[angioplasty]], for example, was performed with a Fogarty catheter in 1965, and has led to over six hundred fifty thousand such operations per year. Fogarty has also modified his catheter to less invasive [[biopsy]] techniques.\n\nAfter completing his residency and becoming a cardiovascular surgeon, Fogarty continued to invent new medical devices. One of his most successful products is the [[Stent]]-Graft, which dealt with the difficult problem of [[abdominal aortic aneurysm]]s (a term referring to a weakened [[blood vessel]]). The old method was to remove the bad part of a weakened blood vessel, but Fogarty's idea was to support it with an implant. He used a stent, a thin polyester tube that grabs onto the blood vessels. A catheter transports the stent to the weakened blood vessel, and once the balloon is inflated, the stent expands to the size of the blood vessel, and blood flows normally.\n\nFogarty's other inventions include Fogarty surgical clips and clamps, which are used by cardiac and vascular surgeons to temporarily occlude vessels during surgery. Working with Warren Hancock, he is co-inventor of the Hancock tissue heart valve \u2013 the world's first porcine valve.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nFogarty's own inventions and the many others that resulted from his original embolectomy catheter heavily influenced the way surgery was performed. Considered one of the pioneers of minimally-invasive surgery, Fogarty has said: \"I had no concept that [non-invasive surgery] would reach the magnitude that it has.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs a result of the embolectomy catheter and other inventions, Dr. Fogarty has won many prizes, including the [[National Medal of Technology and Innovation|National Medal for Technology and Innovation]] in 2012,<ref name=\":6\" /> and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the [[AdvaMed|Advanced Medical Technology Association (AdvaMed)]] in 2015.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.advamed.org/newsroom/press-releases/advamed-honors-dr-thomas-j-fogarty-lifetime-achievement-award|title=AdvaMed Honors Dr. Thomas J.

At the age of 17, he quit his boxing career after he broke his nose in a match that ended in a draw. A family priest gave him a recommendation, and because of his awful grades, he was admitted to Cincinnati's [[Xavier University]] on probation.<ref name=\":2\" /> Jack Cranley, one of the most prominent [[Vascular surgery|vascular surgeons]] in the United States became his mentor. Speaking of Cranley, Fogarty later stated: \u201cI had a mentor who encouraged me and helped to persuade me to go to college\u2026 He had 10 kids and I became the 11th.

Blood flow is usually interrupted in the procedure, increasing the risk of the patient losing a limb.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Riggins|first=Christie|date=Fall 2000|title=Great inventions don't happen overnight: development of the Fogarty balloon catheter|url=http://sm.stanford.edu/archive/stanmed/2000fall/inventions.html|journal=Stanford Medicine|volume= 17| issue =  3|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nAt home, the ideas that went through Fogarty's head concerned different ways of making the procedure better, and he especially concentrated on avoiding the risky incisions. He tinkered with a [[urethra]]l [[catheter]] and a balloon in his attic. Because a catheter only required a small incision, it would be able to get to the clot without much trauma to the patient. The urethral catheter is also flexible yet strong enough to be pushed through a blood clot. As for the balloon, he basically cut off the tip of the pinky finger of a size 5 surgical [[latex glove]] and attempted to incorporate it onto the end of the catheter.<ref name=\":3\" /> The resulting balloon could be inflated with [[Saline (medicine)|saline]] using a [[syringe]], and once it expands to the size of the artery, it is then retracted, withdrawing the clot through the artery and out the incision.\n\nThe main problem in building this device was the way the balloon could be attached to the catheter. Glue that could hold [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]], the material making up a catheter, and latex, the type of glove used, was not available. Fogarty's own take on the catheter came about because of fishing techniques he learned as a child. Precise hand-tying was needed in fishing, and with these techniques, he tied the balloon to the catheter. \"I'd always tied flies and made lures so it was just a natural thing.\"<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> His experimental balloon catheter, however, always seemed to burst when it was over inflated. It even broke when he dragged it through glass tubes filled with [[Jell-o]], a model he thought simulated a clot within an artery. After some time, he figured out the type and thickness of rubber that was firm enough when inflated to extract a clot and still flexible enough to move through without breaking. The device, made before Fogarty even received his MD from University of Cincinnati in 1960, became the first [[minimally invasive]] surgical device.\n\nFogarty, however, came across difficulties in getting a manufacturer to produce it. From 1959 to 1961, nobody was willing to help. \"Companies thought I was some stooge fooling around. I didn't have any credibility.\"<ref name=\":5\" />  Dr. Cranley continued to encourage him, and soon, during his fellowship training at the University of Cincinnati in 1961 and 1962, Fogarty started to make the catheter system by hand for himself and for other vascular surgeons.\n\nAt the University of Oregon, while Fogarty was completing his residency in surgery, Dr. Al Starr, head of the cardiothoracic division, used Fogarty's balloon catheters. After he was informed that no company was willing to manufacture Fogarty's device, he asked one of his acquaintances, Lowell Edwards, an electrical engineer and president of his own company, to give the device consideration in producing it. In 1969, Fogarty patented his device, and Edwards Life Sciences from [[Irvine, California]], was assigned the patent to begin manufacturing the Fogarty embolectomy catheter.\n\nBecause of the decreased risk associated with the device, Fogarty's balloon catheter became the industry standard and remains the most widely used catheter for blood-clot removal. Before his invention the success rate for removing an embolus, or blood clot, was forty to fifty percent. The balloon catheter is now used in over three hundred thousand procedures every year all over the world, and is estimated to have saved the lives and limbs of approximately twenty million patients.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalmedals.org/laureates/thomas-j-fogarty|title=Thomas J. Fogarty. 2012 National Medal of Technology and Innovation, Medicine|website=National Science & Technology Medals Foundation|access-date=January 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Other inventions ==\n\nNumerous sequel applications of Fogarty's catheter came about. The first balloon [[angioplasty]], for example, was performed with a Fogarty catheter in 1965, and has led to over six hundred fifty thousand such operations per year. Fogarty has also modified his catheter to less invasive [[biopsy]] techniques.\n\nAfter completing his residency and becoming a cardiovascular surgeon, Fogarty continued to invent new medical devices. One of his most successful products is the [[Stent]]-Graft, which dealt with the difficult problem of [[abdominal aortic aneurysm]]s (a term referring to a weakened [[blood vessel]]). The old method was to remove the bad part of a weakened blood vessel, but Fogarty's idea was to support it with an implant. He used a stent, a thin polyester tube that grabs onto the blood vessels. A catheter transports the stent to the weakened blood vessel, and once the balloon is inflated, the stent expands to the size of the blood vessel, and blood flows normally.\n\nFogarty's other inventions include Fogarty surgical clips and clamps, which are used by cardiac and vascular surgeons to temporarily occlude vessels during surgery. Working with Warren Hancock, he is co-inventor of the Hancock tissue heart valve \u2013 the world's first porcine valve.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nFogarty's own inventions and the many others that resulted from his original embolectomy catheter heavily influenced the way surgery was performed. Considered one of the pioneers of minimally-invasive surgery, Fogarty has said: \"I had no concept that [non-invasive surgery] would reach the magnitude that it has.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs a result of the embolectomy catheter and other inventions, Dr. Fogarty has won many prizes, including the [[National Medal of Technology and Innovation|National Medal for Technology and Innovation]] in 2012,<ref name=\":6\" /> and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the [[AdvaMed|Advanced Medical Technology Association (AdvaMed)]] in 2015.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.advamed.org/newsroom/press-releases/advamed-honors-dr-thomas-j-fogarty-lifetime-achievement-award|title=AdvaMed Honors Dr. Thomas J.

Finally, the rank correlation is the difference between the two proportions (.60 minus .40), hence r = .20.\n\n==Software implementations==\n* [[R (programming language)|R]] includes an implementation of the test as <code>wilcox.test(x,y, paired=TRUE)</code>, where x and y are vectors of equal length.<ref>{{cite book |first=Peter |last=Dalgaard |title=Introductory Statistics with R |location= |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-387-79053-4 |pages=99\u2013100 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YI0kT8cuiVUC&pg=PA99 }}</ref>\n* [http://www.alglib.net/statistics/hypothesistesting/wilcoxonsignedrank.php ALGLIB] includes implementation of the Wilcoxon signed-rank test in C++, C#, Delphi, Visual Basic, etc.\n* [[GNU Octave]] implements various one-tailed and two-tailed versions of the test in the <code>wilcoxon_test</code> function.\n* [http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.wilcoxon.html SciPy] includes an implementation of the Wilcoxon signed-rank test in Python\n* [http://accord-framework.net/docs/html/T_Accord_Statistics_Testing_WilcoxonSignedRankTest.htm Accord.NET] includes an implementation of the Wilcoxon signed-rank test in C# for .NET applications\n* [https://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/signrank.html MATLAB] implements this test  using \"Wilcoxon rank sum test\" as [p,h] = signrank(x,y) also returns a logical value indicating the test decision.
