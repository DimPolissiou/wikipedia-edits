However, there are enough literary evidences which define the history of Raipur since the time of the [[Maurya Empire]]. Raipur district was once part of Southern Kosal and considered to be under the Maurya Empire. Raipur had later been the capital of the Haihaya Kings, controlling the traditional forts of Chhattisgarh for a long time. Satawahana Kings ruled this part till the 2nd-3rd century AD. Samudragupta had conquered this region in the fourth century, but the region came under the sway of Sarabhpuri Kings and then Nala Kings in 5th and 6th centuries. Later on Somavanshi kings had taken the control over this region and ruled with Sirpur as their capital city. The Kalchuri Kings of Tumman ruled this part for a long time making Ratanpur as capital. It is believed that the King Ramachandra of this dynasty established the city of Raipur and subsequently made it the capital of his kingdom.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://raipur-heritage.mapunity.com/|title=Raipur Heritage and History|website=raipur-heritage.mapunity.com|access-date=2019-01-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190108145552/http://raipur-heritage.mapunity.com/|archive-date=8 January 2019|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAnother story about Raipur is that King Ramachandra's son Brahmdeo Rai had established Raipur. His capital was Khalwatika (now Khallari). The newly constructed city was named after Brahmdeo Rai as \u2018Raipur\u2019. It was during his time in 1402 A.D. that the temple of Hatkeshwar Mahadev was constructed on the banks of the river Kharun which still remains one of the oldest landmarks in Raipur. After the death of king Amarsingh Deo, this region had become the domain of Bhonsle Kings of Nagpur.\nWith the death of Raghuji the III, the territory was assumed by the British government from Bhonsle's and Chhattisgarh was declared a separate Commission with its headquarters at Raipur in 1854. After independence, Raipur district was included in the Central Provinces and Berar. Raipur district became a part of Madhya Pradesh on 1 November 1956 and subsequently became a part of Chhattisgarh on 1 November 2000 with Raipur becoming the capital of the new state.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://raipur.gov.in/history/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190102184714/https://raipur.gov.in/history/ |archive-date=2 January 2019 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{See also|List of cities in Chhattisgarh}}\n<!-- There is a separate article for the district, so statistics should be for the municipality only!! -->\n{{As of|2011|alt=As of the}} [[2011 census of India|2011 census]], Raipur Municipal Corporation had a population of 1,010,087, of which 519,286 are males and 490,801 are females \u2014a sex ratio of 945 females per 1000 males, higher than the national average of 940 per 1000.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sex Ratio|url=http://censusindia.gov.in/2011-prov-results/indiaatglance.html|publisher=The Registrar General & Census Commissioner, India|accessdate=2 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140922103426/http://censusindia.gov.in/2011-prov-results/indiaatglance.html|archive-date=22 September 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> 124,471 children are in the age group of 0\u20136 years, of which 64,522 are boys and 59,949 are girls \u2014a ratio of 929 girls per 1000 boys.

However, there are enough literary evidences which define the history of Raipur since the time of the [[Maurya Empire]]. Raipur district was once part of Southern Kosal and considered to be under the Maurya Empire. Raipur had later been the capital of the Haihaya Kings, controlling the traditional forts of Chhattisgarh for a long time. Satawahana Kings ruled this part till the 2nd-3rd century AD. Samudragupta had conquered this region in the fourth century, but the region came under the sway of Sarabhpuri Kings and then Nala Kings in 5th and 6th centuries. Later on Somavanshi kings had taken the control over this region and ruled with Sirpur as their capital city. The Kalchuri Kings of Tumman ruled this part for a long time making Ratanpur as capital. It is believed that the King Ramachandra of this dynasty established the city of Raipur and subsequently made it the capital of his kingdom.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://raipur-heritage.mapunity.com/|title=Raipur Heritage and History|website=raipur-heritage.mapunity.com|access-date=2019-01-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190108145552/http://raipur-heritage.mapunity.com/|archive-date=8 January 2019|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAnother story about Raipur is that King Ramachandra's son Brahmdeo Rai had established Raipur. His capital was Khalwatika (now Khallari). The newly constructed city was named after Brahmdeo Rai as \u2018Raipur\u2019. It was during his time in 1402 A.D. that the temple of Hatkeshwar Mahadev was constructed on the banks of the river Kharun which still remains one of the oldest landmarks in Raipur. After the death of king Amarsingh Deo, this region had become the domain of Bhonsle Kings of Nagpur.\nWith the death of Raghuji the III, the territory was assumed by the British government from Bhonsle's and Chhattisgarh was declared a separate Commission with its headquarters at Raipur in 1854. After independence, Raipur district was included in the Central Provinces and Berar. Raipur district became a part of Madhya Pradesh on 1 November 1956 and subsequently became a part of Chhattisgarh on 1 November 2000 with Raipur becoming the capital of the new state.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://raipur.gov.in/history/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190102184714/https://raipur.gov.in/history/ |archive-date=2 January 2019 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{See also|List of cities in Chhattisgarh}}\n<!-- There is a separate article for the district, so statistics should be for the municipality only!! -->\n{{As of|2011|alt=As of the}} [[2011 census of India|2011 census]], Raipur Municipal Corporation had a population of 1,010,087, of which 519,286 are males and 490,801 are females \u2014a sex ratio of 945 females per 1000 males, higher than the national average of 940 per 1000.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sex Ratio|url=http://censusindia.gov.in/2011-prov-results/indiaatglance.html|publisher=The Registrar General & Census Commissioner, India|accessdate=2 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140922103426/http://censusindia.gov.in/2011-prov-results/indiaatglance.html|archive-date=22 September 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> 124,471 children are in the age group of 0\u20136 years, of which 64,522 are boys and 59,949 are girls \u2014a ratio of 929 girls per 1000 boys.

Only part of the suggested change was approved by the FA's meeting:  the throw-in would be awarded against the team who kicked the ball out of play, but it could not be replaced by a kick-in.

This new throw-in law, requiring the ball to be thrown from over the head with two hands, was formally adopted by the FA in 1883.<ref name=\"fa_1883\">{{cite wikisource |title=Laws of the Game (1883)}}</ref>\n\n====Scoring a goal from a throw-in====\n\nThe laws of the game have never permitted a goal to be scored directly from a throw-in by the attacking team.<ref>e.g. {{cite wikisource |title=Laws of the Game (1863) |quote=A goal shall be won when the ball passes between the goal posts or over the space between the goal posts (at whatever height), '''not being thrown''', knocked on, or carried.}}</ref>  In 1882, a change in the laws, introduced by N.

He last played for the [[Meralco Bolts]] of the [[Philippine Basketball Association]] (PBA). He is the younger brother of [[Yancy de Ocampo]]. Both played together with [[Barako Bull Energy|FedEx]] and [[Tropang TNT|Talk 'N Text]]. He is also a five-time [[Philippines men's national basketball team|National Team]] member.\n\n==College career==\nDe Ocampo started playing organized basketball at the [[Saint Francis of Assisi College System]] Doves together with his brother, Yancy. The De Ocampo brothers led the varsity squad to several [[National Capital Region Athletic Association|NCRAA]] titles. Upon the exit of the older De Ocampo, the Doves was still dominating the league with him alongside [[Ervin Sotto]] and [[Al Vergara]]. Thus, he led the squad into several statistical categories such as scoring and rebounding. He won four NCRAA MVP plums making him arguably the finest player in the history of the NCRAA.\n\n==Professional career==\nIn 2004, after a celebrated collegiate career at St. Francis, De Ocampo decided to turn pro and enter the PBA draft. He was selected by the [[FedEx Express]] as the fourth overall pick, having selected ahead of higher profile players such as classy UE point guard [[Paul Artadi]], multi-titled [[Philippine Basketball League|PBL]] veteran [[Gary David]] and former [[Ateneo Blue Eagles]] star [[Wesley Gonzales]].\n\nDuring his rookie year, he played alongside his brother [[Yancy de Ocampo|Yancy]]. He played in a total of 59 games and averaged decent rookie numbers of 7.5 points and 4.6 rebounds while playing a little over 21 minutes of action per game.\n\nAfter a so-so performance in his first year, he made an impact in the [[2005\u201306 PBA season|2005\u201306 season]] by improving his rookie numbers of 7.5 points per game to 13.3 in his sophomore year in 37 of 51 games played. He also registered 6.7 rebounds and 2.4 assists in that year.\n\nIn 2008, de Ocampo was again included in the [[Philippines men's national basketball team|RP Training Pool]], his second stint, assembled by the [[Philippine Basketball Association|PBA]] under Coach [[Yeng Guiao]].\n\nIn the middle of the [[2008\u201309 PBA Philippine Cup]], he was traded to the [[Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters]] for veteran [[Don Allado]].<ref>[http://www.philstar.com/youngstar/ysarticle.aspx?articleId=424597&publicationSubCategoryId=69 Texters get De Ocampo for Allado]</ref> His all-around play helped them beat the [[Alaska Aces (PBA)|Alaska Aces]] in that conference's finals series, 4-3, earning him his first PBA title.\n[[File:2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup Croatia vs Philippines_(2).jpg|250px|thumbnail|De Ocampo (#9) at the [[2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup]] ]]\n\nIn 2015, de Ocampo led the Texters to the [[2015 PBA Commissioner's Cup]] championship, winning a seven-game series against [[Rain or Shine Elasto Painters]]. On April 29, 2015, de Ocampo was named as the [[Philippine Basketball Association Finals Most Valuable Player award|Finals MVP]].

He last played for the [[Meralco Bolts]] of the [[Philippine Basketball Association]] (PBA). He is the younger brother of [[Yancy de Ocampo]]. Both played together with [[Barako Bull Energy|FedEx]] and [[Tropang TNT|Talk 'N Text]]. He is also a five-time [[Philippines men's national basketball team|National Team]] member.\n\n==College career==\nDe Ocampo started playing organized basketball at the [[Saint Francis of Assisi College System]] Doves together with his brother, Yancy. The De Ocampo brothers led the varsity squad to several [[National Capital Region Athletic Association|NCRAA]] titles. Upon the exit of the older De Ocampo, the Doves was still dominating the league with him alongside [[Ervin Sotto]] and [[Al Vergara]]. Thus, he led the squad into several statistical categories such as scoring and rebounding. He won four NCRAA MVP plums making him arguably the finest player in the history of the NCRAA.\n\n==Professional career==\nIn 2004, after a celebrated collegiate career at St. Francis, De Ocampo decided to turn pro and enter the PBA draft. He was selected by the [[FedEx Express]] as the fourth overall pick, having selected ahead of higher profile players such as classy UE point guard [[Paul Artadi]], multi-titled [[Philippine Basketball League|PBL]] veteran [[Gary David]] and former [[Ateneo Blue Eagles]] star [[Wesley Gonzales]].\n\nDuring his rookie year, he played alongside his brother [[Yancy de Ocampo|Yancy]]. He played in a total of 59 games and averaged decent rookie numbers of 7.5 points and 4.6 rebounds while playing a little over 21 minutes of action per game.\n\nAfter a so-so performance in his first year, he made an impact in the [[2005\u201306 PBA season|2005\u201306 season]] by improving his rookie numbers of 7.5 points per game to 13.3 in his sophomore year in 37 of 51 games played. He also registered 6.7 rebounds and 2.4 assists in that year.\n\nIn 2008, de Ocampo was again included in the [[Philippines men's national basketball team|RP Training Pool]], his second stint, assembled by the [[Philippine Basketball Association|PBA]] under Coach [[Yeng Guiao]].\n\nIn the middle of the [[2008\u201309 PBA Philippine Cup]], he was traded to the [[Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters]] for veteran [[Don Allado]].<ref>[http://www.philstar.com/youngstar/ysarticle.aspx?articleId=424597&publicationSubCategoryId=69 Texters get De Ocampo for Allado]</ref> His all-around play helped them beat the [[Alaska Aces (PBA)|Alaska Aces]] in that conference's finals series, 4-3, earning him his first PBA title.\n[[File:2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup Croatia vs Philippines_(2).jpg|250px|thumbnail|De Ocampo (#9) at the [[2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup]] ]]\n\nIn 2015, de Ocampo led the Texters to the [[2015 PBA Commissioner's Cup]] championship, winning a seven-game series against [[Rain or Shine Elasto Painters]]. On April 29, 2015, de Ocampo was named as the [[Philippine Basketball Association Finals Most Valuable Player award|Finals MVP]]. During the series, he averaged 24.3 points and 6.6 rebounds and as well as shooting at an impressive 40% from the [[three-point field goal|three-point area]] over the course of seven games.<ref>{{ cite news |title=Talk \u2018N Text\u2019s Ranidel De Ocampo named Finals MVP of Commissioner\u2019s Cup |url=http://www.interaksyon.com/interaktv/talk-n-texts-ranidel-de-ocampo-named-finals-mvp-of-commissioners-cup |work=InterAksyon.com |date=April 29, 2015 |accessdate=March 3, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nIn September 11, 2017, de Ocampo was dealt to the [[Meralco Bolts]] along with KaTropa's 2019 second round pick for [[Justin Chua]] and [[Norbert Torres]] in a three-team trade with Phoenix and Meralco.<ref>[http://www.spin.ph/basketball/pba/news/ranidel-de-ocampo-norbert-torres-trade-tnt-phoenix-pba Ranidel de Ocampo ends up in Meralco after TNT trades stalwart in three-team deal]</ref>\n\nIn April 13, 2020, de Ocampo announced his retired from professional basketball.<ref>[https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10217640390974645&id=1025088760]</ref>\n\n==International career==\nHe was included in the [[Gilas Pilipinas]] roster that placed second in the [[2013 FIBA Asia Championship]] held in [[Manila]] and earned a ticket to compete in the [[2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup]].
