Erik has been talking to us since [[Doomsday X]] to record us, and with Gus Rios (Drums) being in the band full time now, we didn't want him to have the responsibility of producing the album as well as writing and playing. Erik really understands what we are about, and has all of the same thoughts about recording as us. It really couldn't be a better working situation. We've said it before but this album really is without a doubt is the most relentless, focused and brutal MALEVOLENT CREATION album ever!

We've said it before but this album really is without a doubt is the most relentless, focused and brutal MALEVOLENT CREATION album ever!

The first was built by [[Stephen I of Hungary]] between 1001\u20131010 (as the original Saint Adalbert church), the first cathedral in Hungary, which was burned down at the end of the 12th century. It was rebuilt, and even survived the Mongol invasion of Hungary. However, in 1304, [[Wenceslaus III of Bohemia|Wenceslaus III]], a probable candidate for the Hungarian throne, sacked the castle and the church. It was repaired in the following years. The archbishops of the 14th and 15th century made the church more ornate and added a huge library, the second most significant one in the country. It was ruined again under Turkish rule, in 1543. In 1820, the Archdiocese was restored and archbishop S\u00e1ndor Rudnay decided to restore Esztergom's status as mother church of the country. The church maintains the relics of Catholic martyr and saint [[Marko Krizin]].\n\nThe architect was [[P\u00e1l K\u00fchnel]] and the lead contractor was [[J\u00e1nos Packh]]. The foundation-stone was laid and work began in 1822. The Bak\u00f3cz chapel was carefully disassembled (into about 1,600&nbsp;pieces) and was moved 20&nbsp;metres away from its original location and attached to the new basilica. In 1838 Packh was murdered, so [[J\u00f3zsef Hild]] was placed in charge of construction. He completed it in Classicistic style. Under the next archbishop, [[J\u00e1nos Scitovszky]], the upper church was completed and dedicated on August 31, 1856. The 1856 consecration ceremonies featured the premiere of the ''Missa solennis zur Einweihung der Basilika in Gran (Gran Mass)'', composed and conducted by [[Franz Liszt]], and featuring the organist [[Alexander Winterberger]].

They played the season in the [[Premier League|Premiership]], the highest level of English football. This marked their first ever appearance in the modern Premier League, and their first season in the top flight since [[1983\u201384 Football League|1983\u201384]]. The club had been promoted after having won the [[2003 Football League First Division play-off Final|play-off final]] at the end of the previous season to earn the final promotion spot.\n\nTheir return to the top level proved short-lived as the team struggled throughout the campaign and were eventually relegated in 20th place, finishing bottom of the division on goal difference, seven points short of safety. They were officially relegated after failing to win their penultimate game, although their vastly inferior goal difference meant that survival was effectively ruled out on 1 May 2004, despite victory, owing to relegation rivals Manchester City also winning.\n\nWolves became the third team in [[Premier League records and statistics|Premier League history to fail to win an away game]] during a season. Contributing to this outcome was a series of serious injuries to key players, with [[Matt Murray (English footballer)|Matt Murray]] and [[Joleon Lescott]] missing almost the entire season and [[Mark Kennedy (footballer, born 1976)|Mark Kennedy]] and [[Kenny Miller]] kept out for long periods.\n\n==Results==\n\n===Pre season===\nWolves split their squad into two groups, one led by manager Dave Jones, another by coach [[Terry Connor]] after assistant manager [[John Ward (footballer, born 1951)|John Ward]] left the club.<ref>{{cite news|title=John Ward leaves Wolves |url=http://www.wolves.co.uk/page/News/0,,10307~396589,00.html |publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C |date=7 July 2003 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401234216/http://www.wolves.co.uk/page/News/0%2C%2C10307~396589%2C00.html |archivedate=1 April 2012 }}</ref> Preparations also included a week's warm weather training in [[Jerez]], Spain.<ref>{{cite news|title=Setting up camp |url=http://www.wolves.co.uk/page/News/0,,10307~391394,00.html |publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C |date=17 June 2003 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401234216/http://www.wolves.co.uk/page/News/0%2C%2C10307~391394%2C00.html |archivedate=1 April 2012 }}</ref> A planned friendly against Dutch side [[ADO Den Haag]] was cancelled on the day of the game after a water leak hit the venue, [[Telford United F.C.|Telford United]]'s [[New Bucks Head|Bucks Head]] stadium.<ref>{{cite news|title=Friendly called off |url=http://www.wolves.co.uk/page/News/0,,10307~402997,00.html |publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C |date=25 July 2003 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401234216/http://www.wolves.co.uk/page/News/0%2C%2C10307~402997%2C00.html |archivedate=1 April 2012 }}</ref> Only the final friendly was held at Wolves' Molineux home. \n{{Football box collapsible\n|date=14 July 2003 \n|time=19:45 [[British Summer Time|BST]]\n|team1=[[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]]\n|score=0\u20131\n|report=[https://web.archive.org/web/20120401234216/http://www.wolves.co.uk/page/News/0%2C%2C10307~398784%2C00.html Report]\n|team2=Wolverhampton Wanderers\n|goals2=[[John Melligan|Melligan]] {{goal|15}}\n|stadium=[[Memorial Stadium (Bristol)|Memorial Stadium]]\n|location=[[Bristol]]\n|attendance=4,464\n|referee=[[Mick Fletcher]]\n|result=W\n}}\n{{Football box collapsible\n|date=14 July 2003 \n|time=19:45 [[British Summer Time|BST]]\n|team1=[[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]]\n|score=1\u20131\n|report=[https://web.archive.org/web/20120401234216/http://www.wolves.co.uk/page/News/0%2C%2C10307~398798%2C00.html Report]\n|team2=Wolverhampton Wanderers\n|goals1=[[Rob Purdie|Purdie]] {{goal|16}}\n|goals2=[[Adam Proudlock|Proudlock]] {{goal|57}}\n|stadium=[[Edgar Street]]\n|location=[[Hereford]]\n|attendance=1,895\n|referee=S.

They played the season in the [[Premier League|Premiership]], the highest level of English football. This marked their first ever appearance in the modern Premier League, and their first season in the top flight since [[1983\u201384 Football League|1983\u201384]]. The club had been promoted after having won the [[2003 Football League First Division play-off Final|play-off final]] at the end of the previous season to earn the final promotion spot.\n\nTheir return to the top level proved short-lived as the team struggled throughout the campaign and were eventually relegated in 20th place, finishing bottom of the division on goal difference, seven points short of safety. They were officially relegated after failing to win their penultimate game, although their vastly inferior goal difference meant that survival was effectively ruled out on 1 May 2004, despite victory, owing to relegation rivals Manchester City also winning. \n\nWolves became the third team in [[Premier League records and statistics|Premier League history to fail to win an away game]] during a season. Contributing to this outcome was a series of serious injuries to key players, with [[Matt Murray (English footballer)|Matt Murray]] and [[Joleon Lescott]] missing almost the entire season and [[Mark Kennedy (footballer, born 1976)|Mark Kennedy]] and [[Kenny Miller]] kept out for long periods. \n\n==Results==\n\n===Pre season===\nWolves split their squad into two groups, one led by manager Dave Jones, another by coach [[Terry Connor]] after assistant manager [[John Ward (footballer, born 1951)|John Ward]] left the club.<ref>{{cite news|title=John Ward leaves Wolves |url=http://www.wolves.co.uk/page/News/0,,10307~396589,00.html |publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C |date=7 July 2003 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401234216/http://www.wolves.co.uk/page/News/0%2C%2C10307~396589%2C00.html |archivedate=1 April 2012 }}</ref> Preparations also included a week's warm weather training in [[Jerez]], Spain.<ref>{{cite news|title=Setting up camp |url=http://www.wolves.co.uk/page/News/0,,10307~391394,00.html |publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C |date=17 June 2003 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401234216/http://www.wolves.co.uk/page/News/0%2C%2C10307~391394%2C00.html |archivedate=1 April 2012 }}</ref> A planned friendly against Dutch side [[ADO Den Haag]] was cancelled on the day of the game after a water leak hit the venue, [[Telford United F.C.|Telford United]]'s [[New Bucks Head|Bucks Head]] stadium.<ref>{{cite news|title=Friendly called off |url=http://www.wolves.co.uk/page/News/0,,10307~402997,00.html |publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C |date=25 July 2003 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401234216/http://www.wolves.co.uk/page/News/0%2C%2C10307~402997%2C00.html |archivedate=1 April 2012 }}</ref> Only the final friendly was held at Wolves' Molineux home. \n{{Football box collapsible\n|date=14 July 2003 \n|time=19:45 [[British Summer Time|BST]]\n|team1=[[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]]\n|score=0\u20131\n|report=[https://web.archive.org/web/20120401234216/http://www.wolves.co.uk/page/News/0%2C%2C10307~398784%2C00.html Report]\n|team2=Wolverhampton Wanderers\n|goals2=[[John Melligan|Melligan]] {{goal|15}}\n|stadium=[[Memorial Stadium (Bristol)|Memorial Stadium]]\n|location=[[Bristol]]\n|attendance=4,464\n|referee=[[Mick Fletcher]]\n|result=W\n}}\n{{Football box collapsible\n|date=14 July 2003 \n|time=19:45 [[British Summer Time|BST]]\n|team1=[[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]]\n|score=1\u20131\n|report=[https://web.archive.org/web/20120401234216/http://www.wolves.co.uk/page/News/0%2C%2C10307~398798%2C00.html Report]\n|team2=Wolverhampton Wanderers\n|goals1=[[Rob Purdie|Purdie]] {{goal|16}}\n|goals2=[[Adam Proudlock|Proudlock]] {{goal|57}}\n|stadium=[[Edgar Street]]\n|location=[[Hereford]]\n|attendance=1,895\n|referee=S.

The [[New Bond Street]], [[London]] gallery closed its doors in August 2018 after being occupied by The Fine Art Society since February 1876, the entrance fa\u00e7ade of which was designed in 1881 by [[Edward William Godwin]] (1833\u20131886).\n\n==History==\nFounded in 1876 by a group of like-minded men led by William Longman of the publishing family, [[Marcus Bourne Huish]] (1843\u20131904), lawyer, editor, writer and collector, who became the first Managing Director while at the same time editing ''[[The Art Journal]]''; and [[Archibald Stuart-Wortley (politician)|Archibald Stuart-Wortley MP]].  The gallery, first managed by Ernest Brown (later founder of [[Leicester Galleries]]) has for many years largely concentrated on British art and design from 1600 to the present day; with the Edinburgh premises specialising in Scottish art of the same period. The Edinburgh branch of the company is directed by Emily Walsh.  The Chairmen were all drawn from the Longman family until the death of Mark Longman in 1972. Since then only Lord Macfarlane of Bearsden KT (until 1998), Sir Angus Grossart (until 2016) and Robin Holland-Martin (current) have held the position. Only seven people have held the position of Managing Director in the past 139 years, the last being Pippa Stockdale.\n\nThe Fine Art Society has taken part in key international art fairs over the years, most notably at [[TEFAF]] Maastricht, Masterpiece, London, [[Frieze Masters]], London and at the [[London Original Print Fair]], whose founder and chairman, Gordon Cooke, is also the society's 19th and 20th century prints specialist. The society has also exhibited in art fairs in New York, Miami, Hong Kong, Paris and Dubai.\n\n==Exhibitions==\nThe gallery is also known as the pioneer of the one-man exhibition, most famously that of [[James McNeill Whistler]]'s First Venice Set of etchings in December 1880; the gallery having sent Whistler to [[Venice]] in 1879 in part to enable him to escape from the issues following his libel action against [[John Ruskin]]. The commission was for Whistler to travel to Venice for three months to create a series of twelve etchings. Beguiled by the city, he stayed for fourteen months and completed approximately fifty etchings. Venice also inspired Whistler to make some hundred works in pastel, of which 53 were shown in the Venice Pastels exhibition in 1881. During Whistler's absence in Venice, the gallery showed his antagonist John Ruskin's private Collection of Watercolours by [[J. M. W. Turner]], and ran a subscription to pay for Ruskin's legal costs: a supreme exhibition of political sleight of hand. Other living exhibitors at the London premises included [[Sir John Everett Millais]], [[John Singer Sargent]], [[Burne-Jones]], [[Frank Brangwyn]], [[Walter Richard Sickert]], [[Walter Crane]], [[George Washington Lambert]], [[Henry Charles Brewer]] and [[Joseph Southall]], and more recently [[Leonard Rosoman]], Emma Sargent, [[Emily Young]], [[John Byrne (playwright)|John Byrne]], [[Alexander Stoddart]] and Geoffrey Clarke.  Of many memorial exhibitions held,  one was for [[Lady Alma Tadema]] in 1910.\n\nA Contemporary gallery was created in 2005, originally managed by Toby Clarke, subsequently by [[Kate Bryan]], and most recently by Lee Cavaliere. Sara Terzi is now the Contemporary art specialist at the gallery.

If a linear map is a [[bijection]] then it is called a '''linear isomorphism'''.\n\nAn important special case is when {{math|1=''V'' = ''W''}}, in which case a linear map is called a (linear) '''[[endomorphism]]''' of {{math|''V''}}. Sometimes the term '''linear operator''' refers to this case.<ref>Linear transformations of {{mvar|V}} into {{mvar|V}} are often called ''linear operators'' on {{mvar|V}} {{harvnb|Rudin|1976|page=207}}</ref> In another convention, ''linear operator'' allows {{mvar|V}} and {{mvar|W}} to differ, while requiring them to be [[Real number|real]] vector spaces.<ref>Let {{mvar|V}} and {{mvar|W}} be two real vector spaces.

Linear maps can often be represented as [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], and simple examples include [[Rotations and reflections in two dimensions|rotation and reflection linear transformations]].\n\nIn the language of [[abstract algebra]], a linear map is a [[module homomorphism]].  In the language of [[category theory]], it is a [[morphism]] in the [[category of modules]] over a given [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]].\n\n== Definition and first consequences ==\nLet <math display=\"inline\">V</math> and <math display=\"inline\">W</math> be vector spaces over the same [[field (mathematics)|field]] <math display=\"inline\">K.</math> A function <math display=\"inline\">f : V \\to W</math> is said to be a ''linear map'' if for any two vectors <math display=\"inline\">\\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{v} \\in V</math> and any scalar <math display=\"inline\">c \\in K</math> the following two conditions are satisfied:\n\n{|\n|-\n| style=\"padding:0 20pt\"|<math>f(\\mathbf{u}+\\mathbf{v}) = f(\\mathbf{u})+f(\\mathbf{v})</math>\n| [[Additive map|additivity]] / operation of addition\n|-\n| style=\"padding:0 20pt\"|<math>f(c \\mathbf{u}) = c f(\\mathbf{u})</math>\n| [[Homogeneous function|homogeneity]] of degree 1 / operation of scalar multiplication\n|}\n\nThus, a linear map is said to be ''operation preserving''.  In other words, it does not matter whether the linear map is applied before or after the operations of addition and scalar multiplication.\n\nThis is equivalent to requiring the same for any linear combination of vectors, i.e. that for any vectors <math display=\"inline\">\\mathbf{u}_1, \\ldots, \\mathbf{u}_n \\in V</math> and scalars <math display=\"inline\">c_1, \\ldots, c_n \\in K,</math> the following equality holds:<ref>{{harvnb|Rudin|1991|page=14}}. Suppose now that {{mvar|X}} and {{mvar|Y}} are vector spaces ''over the same scalar field''. A mapping <math display=\"inline\">\\Lambda: X \\to Y</math> is said to be ''linear'' if <math display=\"inline\">\\Lambda(\\alpha x + \\beta y) = \\alpha\\Lambda x + \\beta\\Lambda y</math> for all <math display=\"inline\">x, y \\in X</math> and all scalars <math display=\"inline\">\\alpha</math> and <math display=\"inline\">\\beta</math>.

A mapping {{mvar|A}} of a vector space {{mvar|X}} into a vector space {{mvar|Y}} is said to be a ''linear transformation'' if: <math display=\"inline\">A\\left(\\bf{x}_1 + \\bf{x}_2\\right) = A\\bf{x}_1 + A\\bf{x}_2,\\  A(c\\bf{x}) = cA\\bf{x}</math> for all <math display=\"inline\">\\bf{x}, \\bf{x}_1, \\bf{x}_2 \\in X</math> and all scalars {{mvar|c}}.

It is then necessary to specify which of these ground fields is being used in the definition of \"linear\". If <math display=\"inline\">V</math> and <math display=\"inline\">W</math> are considered as spaces over the field <math display=\"inline\">K</math> as above, we talk about <math display=\"inline\">K</math>-linear maps. For example, the [[complex conjugate|conjugation]] of [[complex numbers]] is an <math display=\"inline\">\\mathbf{R}</math>-linear map <math display=\"inline\">\\mathbf{C} \\to \\mathbf{C}</math>, but it is not <math display=\"inline\">\\mathbf{C}</math>-linear.\n\nA linear map <math display=\"inline\">V \\to K</math> with <math display=\"inline\">K</math> viewed as a one-dimensional vector space over itself is called a [[linear functional]].<ref>{{harvnb|Rudin|1991|page=14}}. Linear mappings of {{mvar|X}} onto its scalar field are called ''linear functionals''.</ref>\n\nThese statements generalize to any left-module <math display=\"inline\">{}_R M</math> over a ring <math display=\"inline\">R</math> without modification, and to any right-module upon reversing of the scalar multiplication.\n\n== Examples ==\n* The prototypical example that gives linear maps their name is the function {{nowrap|1=''f'' : '''R''' \u2192 '''R''' : ''x'' \u21a6 ''cx''}}, of which the graph is a line through the origin.<ref>https://math.stackexchange.com/a/62791/401895</ref>\n* More generally, any [[homothecy]] centered in the origin of a vector space, <math display=\"inline\">v \\mapsto cv</math> where ''c'' is a scalar, is a linear operator.  This does not hold in general for modules, where such a map might only be [[semilinear map|semilinear]].\n* The zero map {{nowrap|''x'' \u21a6 0}} between two left-modules (or two right-modules) over the same ring is always linear.\n* The [[identity function|identity map]] on any module is a linear operator.\n* For real numbers, the map {{nowrap|''x'' \u21a6 ''x''<sup>2</sup>}} is not linear.\n* For real numbers, the map {{nowrap|''x'' \u21a6 ''x'' + 1}} is not linear (but is an [[affine transformation]]; {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''x'' + 1}} is a [[linear equation]], as the term is used in [[analytic geometry]].)\n* If ''A'' is a real {{nowrap|''m'' \u00d7 ''n''}} [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], then ''A'' defines a linear map from  '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> to '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup> by sending the [[column vector]] {{nowrap|'''x''' \u2208 '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} to the column vector {{nowrap|''A'''''x''' \u2208 '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>}}. Conversely, any linear map between [[finite-dimensional]] vector spaces can be represented in this manner; see the [[#Matrices|following section]].\n* [[Derivative|Differentiation]] defines a linear map from the space of all differentiable functions to the space of all functions. It also defines a linear operator on the space of all [[smooth function]]s.\n* The (definite) [[integral]] over some [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] ''I'' is a linear map from the space of all real-valued integrable functions on ''I'' to '''R'''.\n* The (indefinite) [[integral]] (or [[antiderivative]]) with a fixed starting point defines a linear map from the space of all real-valued integrable functions on '''R''' to the space of all real-valued, differentiable functions on '''R'''. Without a fixed starting point, an exercise in group theory will show that the antiderivative maps to the [[quotient space (linear algebra)|quotient space]] of the differentiables over the [[equivalence relation]] \"differ by a constant\", which yields an identity class of the constant valued functions <math display=\"inline\">\\left(\\,\\int\\!:\\  I(\\Re) \\ \\to\\  D(\\Re)/\\Re\\,\\right)</math>.\n* If ''V'' and ''W'' are finite-dimensional vector spaces over a field ''F'', then functions that send linear maps {{nowrap|''f'' : ''V'' \u2192 ''W''}} to {{nowrap|dim<sub>''F''</sub>(''W'') \u00d7 dim<sub>''F''</sub>(''V'')}} matrices in the way described in the sequel are themselves linear maps (indeed [[linear isomorphism]]s).\n* The [[expected value]] of a [[Random variable#Definition|random variable]] (which is in fact a function, and as such a member of a vector space) is linear, as for random variables ''X'' and ''Y'' we have {{nowrap|1=E[''X'' + ''Y''] = E[''X''] + E[''Y'']}} and {{nowrap|1=E[''aX''] = ''a''E[''X'']}}, but the [[variance]] of a random variable is not linear.\n\n<gallery widths=300 heights=200>\nFile:Streckung eines Vektors.gif|The function <math display=\"inline\">f:\\R^2 \\to \\R^2</math> with <math display=\"inline\">f(x, y) = (2x, y)</math> is a linear map.

Then every <math display=\"inline\">A \\in L(X, Y)</math> determines a set of numbers <math display=\"inline\">a_{i,j}</math> such that\n\n:<math>A\\bf{x}_j = \\sum_{i=1}^m a_{i,j}\\bf{y}_i\\quad (1 \\leq j \\leq n).</math>\n\nIt is convenient to represent these numbers in a rectangular array of {{mvar|m}} rows and {{mvar|n}} columns, called an {{mvar|m}} ''by'' {{mvar|n}} ''matrix'':\n\n:<math>[A] = \\begin{bmatrix}\n  a_{1,1} & a_{1,2} & \\ldots & a_{1,n} \\\\\n  a_{2,1} & a_{2,2} & \\ldots & a_{2,n} \\\\ \n   \\vdots &  \\vdots & \\ddots &  \\vdots \\\\\n  a_{m,1} & a_{m,2} & \\ldots & a_{m,n}\n\\end{bmatrix}</math>\n\nObserve that the coordinates <math display=\"inline\">a_{i,j}</math> of the vector <math display=\"inline\">A{\\bf x}_j</math> (with respect to the basis <math display=\"inline\">\\{\\bf{y}_1, \\ldots, \\bf{y}_m\\}</math>) appear in the ''j''<sup>th</sup> column of <math display=\"inline\">[A]</math>. The vectors <math display=\"inline\">A{\\bf x}_j</math> are therefore sometimes called the ''column vectors'' of <math display=\"inline\">[A]</math>. With this terminology, the ''range'' of {{mvar|A}} ''is spanned by the column vectors of <math display=\"inline\">[A]</math>''.\n</ref> This is useful because it allows concrete calculations. Matrices yield examples of linear maps: if ''A'' is a real {{nowrap|''m'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix, then {{nowrap|1=''f''('''x''') = ''A'''''x'''}} describes a linear map {{nowrap|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> \u2192 '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>}} (see [[Euclidean space]]).\n\nLet {'''v'''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, '''v'''<sub>''n''</sub>} be a basis for ''V''.  Then every vector '''v''' in ''V'' is uniquely determined by the coefficients ''c''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''c''<sub>''n''</sub> in the field '''R''':\n\n: <math>c_1 \\mathbf{v}_1 + \\cdots + c_n \\mathbf{v}_n.</math>\n\nIf {{nowrap|''f'' : ''V'' \u2192 ''W''}} is a linear map,\n\n: <math>f\\left(c_1 \\mathbf{v}_1 + \\cdots + c_n \\mathbf{v}_n\\right) = c_1 f\\left(\\mathbf{v}_1\\right) + \\cdots + c_n f\\left(\\mathbf{v}_n\\right),</math>\n\nwhich implies that the function ''f'' is entirely determined by the vectors ''f''('''v'''<sub>1</sub>), \u2026, ''f''('''v'''<sub>''n''</sub>). Now let {{nowrap|{'''w'''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, '''w'''<sub>''m''</sub>} }} be a basis for ''W''.  Then we can represent each vector ''f''('''v'''<sub>''j''</sub>) as\n\n: <math>f\\left(\\mathbf{v}_j\\right) = a_{1j} \\mathbf{w}_1 + \\cdots + a_{mj} \\mathbf{w}_m.</math>\n\nThus, the function ''f'' is entirely determined by the values of ''a''<sub>''ij''</sub>. If we put these values into an {{nowrap|''m'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix ''M'', then we can conveniently use it to compute the vector output of ''f'' for any vector in ''V''.  To get ''M'', every column ''j'' of ''M'' is a vector\n\n: <math>\\begin{pmatrix} a_{1j} & \\cdots & a_{mj} \\end{pmatrix}^\\textsf{T}</math>\n\ncorresponding to ''f''('''v'''<sub>''j''</sub>) as defined above. To define it more clearly, for some column ''j'' that corresponds to the mapping ''f''('''v'''<sub>''j''</sub>),\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{M} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n  \\ \\cdots & a_{1j} & \\cdots\\  \\\\\n           & \\vdots &          \\\\\n           & a_{mj} &\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nwhere '''M''' is the matrix of ''f''. In other words, every column {{nowrap|1=''j'' = 1, \u2026, ''n''}} has a corresponding vector ''f''('''v'''<sub>''j''</sub>) whose coordinates ''a''<sub>1''j''</sub>, \u2026, ''a''<sub>''mj''</sub> are the elements of column ''j''. A single linear map may be represented by many matrices. This is because the values of the elements of a matrix depend on the bases chosen.\n\nThe matrices of a linear transformation can be represented visually:\n\n# Matrix for <math display=\"inline\">T</math> relative to <math display=\"inline\">B</math>: <math display=\"inline\">A</math>\n# Matrix for <math display=\"inline\">T</math> relative to <math display=\"inline\">B'</math>: <math display=\"inline\">A'</math>\n# Transition matrix from <math display=\"inline\">B'</math> to <math display=\"inline\">B</math>: <math display=\"inline\">P</math>\n# Transition matrix from <math display=\"inline\">B</math> to <math display=\"inline\">B'</math>: <math display=\"inline\">P^{-1}</math>\n\n[[File:Linear_transformation_visualization.svg|The relationship between matrices in a linear transformation]]\n\nSuch that starting in the bottom left corner <math display=\"inline\">\\left[\\vec{v}\\right]_{B'}</math> and looking for the bottom right corner <math display=\"inline\">\\left[T\\left(\\vec{v}\\right)\\right]_{B'}</math>, one would left-multiply\u2014that is, <math display=\"inline\">A'\\left[\\vec{v}\\right]_{B'} = \\left[T\\left(\\vec{v}\\right)\\right]_{B'}</math>. The equivalent method would be the \"longer\" method going clockwise from the same point such that <math display=\"inline\">\\left[\\vec{v}\\right]_{B'}</math> is left-multiplied with <math display=\"inline\">P^{-1}AP</math>, or <math display=\"inline\">P^{-1}AP\\left[\\vec{v}\\right]_{B'} = \\left[T\\left(\\vec{v}\\right)\\right]_{B'}</math>.\n\n== Examples of linear transformation matrices ==\nIn two-[[dimension]]al space '''R'''<sup>2</sup> linear maps are described by [[2 \u00d7 2 real matrices]].

It follows from this that the [[class (set theory)|class]] of all vector spaces over a given field ''K'', together with ''K''-linear maps as [[morphism]]s, forms a [[category (mathematics)|category]].\n\nThe [[inverse function|inverse]] of a linear map, when defined, is again a linear map.\n\nIf {{nowrap|''f''<sub>1</sub> : ''V'' \u2192 ''W''}} and {{nowrap|''f''<sub>2</sub> : ''V'' \u2192 ''W''}} are linear, then so is their [[pointwise]] sum {{nowrap|''f''<sub>1</sub> + ''f''<sub>2</sub>}} (which is defined by {{nowrap|1=(''f''<sub>1</sub> + ''f''<sub>2</sub>)('''x''') = (''f''<sub>1</sub>('''x''') + ''f''<sub>2</sub>('''x'''))}}.\n\nIf {{nowrap|''f'' : ''V'' \u2192 ''W''}} is linear and ''a'' is an element of the ground field ''K'', then the map ''af'', defined by {{nowrap|1=(''af'')('''x''') = ''a''(''f''('''x'''))}}, is also linear.\n\nThus the set {{nowrap|''L''(''V'', ''W'')}} of linear maps from ''V'' to ''W'' itself forms a vector space over ''K'', sometimes denoted {{nowrap|Hom(''V'', ''W'')}}.  Furthermore, in the case that {{nowrap|1=''V'' = ''W''}}, this vector space (denoted End(''V'')) is an [[associative algebra]] under [[composition of maps]], since the composition of two linear maps  is again a linear map, and the composition of maps is always associative.  This case is discussed in more detail below.\n\nGiven again the finite-dimensional case, if bases have been chosen, then the composition of linear maps corresponds to the [[matrix multiplication]], the addition of linear maps corresponds to the [[matrix addition]], and the multiplication of linear maps with scalars corresponds to the multiplication of matrices with scalars.\n\n== Endomorphisms and automorphisms ==\n{{main|Endomorphism|Automorphism}}\nA linear transformation ''f'': ''V'' \u2192 ''V'' is an [[endomorphism]] of ''V''; the set of all such endomorphisms End(''V'')  together with addition, composition and scalar multiplication as defined above forms an [[associative algebra]] with identity element over the field ''K'' (and in particular a [[ring (algebra)|ring]]). The multiplicative identity element of this algebra is the [[identity function|identity map]] id: ''V'' \u2192 ''V''.\n\nAn endomorphism of ''V'' that is also an [[isomorphism]] is called an [[automorphism]] of ''V''. The composition of two automorphisms is again an automorphism, and the set of all automorphisms of ''V'' forms a [[group (math)|group]], the [[automorphism group]] of ''V'' which is denoted by Aut(''V'') or GL(''V''). Since the automorphisms are precisely those [[endomorphisms]] which possess inverses under composition, Aut(''V'') is the group of [[Unit (ring theory)|units]] in the ring End(''V'').\n\nIf ''V'' has finite dimension ''n'', then End(''V'') is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[associative algebra]] of all ''n'' \u00d7 ''n'' matrices with entries in ''K''. The automorphism group of ''V'' is [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the  [[general linear group]] GL(''n'', ''K'') of all ''n'' \u00d7 ''n'' invertible matrices with entries in ''K''.\n\n== Kernel, image and the rank\u2013nullity theorem ==\n{{main|Kernel (linear operator)|Image (mathematics)|Rank of a matrix}}\nIf ''f'' : ''V'' \u2192 ''W'' is linear, we define the [[kernel (linear operator)|kernel]] and the [[image (mathematics)|image]] or [[range (mathematics)|range]] of ''f'' by\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n    \\ker(f) &= \\{\\,x \\in V: f(x) = 0\\,\\} \\\\\n    \\operatorname{im}(f) &= \\{\\,w \\in W: w = f(x), x \\in V\\,\\}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nker(''f'') is a [[Linear subspace|subspace]] of ''V'' and im(''f'') is a subspace of ''W''.  The following [[dimension]] formula is known as the [[rank\u2013nullity theorem]]:\n\n: <math>\\dim(\\ker( f )) + \\dim(\\operatorname{im}( f )) = \\dim( V ).</math><ref>{{harvnb|Horn|Johnson|2013|loc=0.2.3 Vector spaces associated with a matrix or linear transformation, p. 6}}</ref>\n\nThe number dim(im(''f'')) is also called the ''rank of f'' and written as rank(''f''), or sometimes, \u03c1(''f''); the number dim(ker(''f'')) is called the ''nullity of f'' and written as null(''f'') or \u03bd(''f''). If ''V'' and ''W'' are finite-dimensional, bases have been chosen and ''f'' is represented by the matrix ''A'', then the rank and nullity of ''f'' are equal to the [[rank of a matrix|rank]] and [[Kernel (matrix)#Subspace properties|nullity]] of the matrix ''A'', respectively.\n\n== Cokernel ==\n{{main|Cokernel}}\n\nA subtler invariant of a linear transformation <math display=\"inline\">f: V \\to W</math> is the [[cokernel|''co''kernel]], which is defined as\n\n: <math>\\operatorname{coker}(f) := W/f(V) = W/\\operatorname{im}(f).</math>\n\nThis is the ''dual'' notion to the kernel: just as the kernel is a ''sub''space of the ''domain,'' the co-kernel is a [[quotient space (linear algebra)|''quotient'' space]] of the ''target.''\nFormally, one has the [[exact sequence]]\n\n: <math>0 \\to \\ker(f) \\to V \\to W \\to \\operatorname{coker}(f) \\to 0.</math>\n\nThese can be interpreted thus: given a linear equation ''f''('''v''') = '''w''' to solve,\n\n* the kernel is the space of ''solutions'' to the ''homogeneous'' equation ''f''('''v''') = 0, and its dimension is the number of ''degrees of freedom'' in a solution, if it exists;\n* the co-kernel is the space of ''constraints'' that must be satisfied if the equation is to have a solution, and its dimension is the number of constraints that must be satisfied for the equation to have a solution.\n\nThe dimension of the co-kernel and the dimension of the image (the rank) add up to the dimension of the target space. For finite dimensions, this means that the dimension of the quotient space ''W''/''f''(''V'') is the dimension of the target space minus the dimension of the image.\n\nAs a simple example, consider the map ''f'': '''R'''<sup>2</sup> \u2192 '''R'''<sup>2</sup>, given by ''f''(''x'', ''y'') = (0, ''y''). Then for an equation ''f''(''x'', ''y'') = (''a'', ''b'') to have a solution, we must have ''a'' = 0 (one constraint), and in that case the solution space is (''x'', ''b'')  or equivalently stated, (0, ''b'') + (''x'', 0), (one degree of freedom). The kernel may be expressed as the subspace (''x'', 0) < ''V'': the value of ''x'' is the freedom in a solution \u2013 while the cokernel may be expressed via the map ''W'' \u2192 '''R''', <math display=\"inline\"> (a, b) \\mapsto (a):</math> given a vector (''a'', ''b''), the value of ''a'' is the ''obstruction'' to there being a solution.\n\nAn example illustrating the infinite-dimensional case is afforded by the map ''f'': '''R'''<sup>\u221e</sup> \u2192 '''R'''<sup>\u221e</sup>, <math display=\"inline\">\\left\\{a_n\\right\\} \\mapsto \\left\\{b_n\\right\\}</math> with ''b''<sub>1</sub> = 0 and ''b''<sub>''n'' + 1</sub> = ''a<sub>n</sub>'' for ''n'' > 0. Its image consists of all sequences with first element 0, and thus its cokernel consists of the classes of sequences with identical first element. Thus, whereas its kernel has dimension 0 (it maps only the zero sequence to the zero sequence), its co-kernel has dimension 1. Since the domain and the target space are the same, the rank and the dimension of the kernel add up to the same [[cardinal number#Cardinal addition|sum]] as the rank and the dimension of the co-kernel ( <math display=\"inline\">\\aleph_0 + 0 = \\aleph_0 + 1</math> ), but in the infinite-dimensional case it cannot be inferred that the kernel and the co-kernel of an [[endomorphism]] have the same dimension (0 \u2260 1). The reverse situation obtains for the map ''h'': '''R'''<sup>\u221e</sup> \u2192 '''R'''<sup>\u221e</sup>, <math display=\"inline\">\\left\\{a_n\\right\\} \\mapsto \\left\\{c_n\\right\\}</math> with ''c<sub>n</sub>'' = ''a''<sub>''n'' + 1</sub>. Its image is the entire target space, and hence its co-kernel has dimension 0, but since it maps all sequences in which only the first element is non-zero to the zero sequence, its kernel has dimension 1.\n\n=== Index ===\nFor a linear operator with finite-dimensional kernel and co-kernel, one may define  ''index'' as:\n\n: <math>\\operatorname{ind}(f) := \\dim(\\ker(f)) - \\dim(\\operatorname{coker}(f)),</math>\n\nnamely the degrees of freedom minus the number of constraints.\n\nFor a transformation between finite-dimensional vector spaces, this is just the difference dim(''V'') \u2212 dim(''W''), by rank\u2013nullity. This gives an indication of how many solutions or how many constraints one has: if mapping from a larger space to a smaller one, the map may be onto, and thus will have degrees of freedom even without constraints. Conversely, if mapping from a smaller space to a larger one, the map cannot be onto, and thus one will have constraints even without degrees of freedom.\n\nThe index of an operator is precisely the [[Euler characteristic]] of the 2-term complex 0 \u2192 ''V'' \u2192 ''W'' \u2192 0. In [[operator theory]], the index of [[Fredholm operator]]s is an object of study, with a major result being the [[Atiyah\u2013Singer index theorem]].<ref>{{SpringerEOM|title=Index theory|id=Index_theory&oldid=23864|first=Victor|last=Nistor}}: \"The main question in index theory is to provide index formulas for classes of Fredholm operators ... Index theory has become a subject on its own only after M. F. Atiyah and I. Singer published their index theorems\"</ref>\n\n== Algebraic classifications of linear transformations ==\nNo classification of linear maps could hope to be exhaustive. The following incomplete list enumerates some important classifications that do not require any additional structure on the vector space.\n\nLet ''V'' and ''W'' denote vector spaces over a field, ''F''. Let ''T'': ''V'' \u2192 ''W'' be a linear map.\n\n* ''T'' is said to be ''[[injective]]'' or a ''[[monomorphism]]'' if any of the following equivalent conditions are true:\n** ''T'' is [[injective|one-to-one]] as a map of [[set (mathematics)|sets]].\n** ker''T'' = {0<sub>''V''</sub>}\n** dim(ker''T'') = 0\n** ''T'' is [[monic morphism|monic]] or left-cancellable, which is to say, for any vector space ''U'' and any pair of linear maps ''R'': ''U'' \u2192 ''V'' and ''S'': ''U'' \u2192 ''V'', the equation ''TR'' = ''TS'' implies ''R'' = ''S''.\n** ''T'' is [[inverse (ring theory)|left-invertible]], which is to say there exists a linear map ''S'': ''W'' \u2192 ''V'' such that ''ST'' is the [[Identity function|identity map]] on ''V''.\n* ''T'' is said to be ''[[surjective]]'' or an ''[[epimorphism]]'' if any of the following equivalent conditions are true:\n** ''T'' is [[surjective|onto]] as a map of sets.\n** [[cokernel|coker]] ''T'' = {0<sub>''W''</sub>}\n** ''T'' is [[epimorphism|epic]] or right-cancellable, which is to say, for any vector space ''U'' and any pair of linear maps ''R'': ''W'' \u2192 ''U'' and ''S'': ''W'' \u2192 ''U'', the equation ''RT'' = ''ST'' implies ''R'' = ''S''.\n** ''T'' is [[inverse (ring theory)|right-invertible]], which is to say there exists a linear map ''S'': ''W'' \u2192 ''V'' such that ''TS'' is the [[Identity function|identity map]] on ''W''.\n* ''T'' is said to be an ''[[isomorphism]]'' if it is both left- and right-invertible. This is equivalent to ''T'' being both one-to-one and onto (a [[bijection]] of sets) or also to ''T'' being both epic and monic, and so being a [[bimorphism]].\n* If ''T'': ''V'' \u2192 ''V'' is an endomorphism, then:\n** If, for some positive integer ''n'', the ''n''-th iterate of ''T'', ''T<sup>n</sup>'', is identically zero, then ''T'' is said to be [[nilpotent]].\n** If ''T''<sup>2</sup> = ''T'', then ''T'' is said to be [[idempotent]]\n** If ''T'' = ''kI'', where ''k'' is some scalar, then ''T'' is said to be a scaling transformation or scalar multiplication map; see [[scalar matrix]].\n\n== Change of basis ==\n{{main|Basis (linear algebra)|Change of basis}}\nGiven a linear map which is an [[endomorphism]] whose matrix is ''A'', in the basis ''B'' of the space it transforms vector coordinates [u] as [v] = ''A''[u]. As vectors change with the inverse of ''B'' (vectors are [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]]) its inverse transformation is [v] = ''B''[v'].\n\nSubstituting this in the first expression\n:<math>B\\left[v'\\right] = AB\\left[u'\\right]</math>\n\nhence\n:<math>\\left[v'\\right] = B^{-1}AB\\left[u'\\right] = A'\\left[u'\\right].</math>\n\nTherefore, the matrix in the new basis is ''A\u2032'' = ''B''<sup>\u22121</sup>''AB'', being ''B'' the matrix of the given basis.\n\nTherefore, linear maps are said to be 1-co- 1-contra-[[covariance and contravariance of vectors|variant]] objects, or type (1, 1) [[tensor]]s.\n\n== Continuity ==\n{{main|Discontinuous linear map}}\n\nA ''linear transformation'' between [[topological vector space]]s, for example [[normed space]]s, may be [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]].  If its domain and codomain are the same, it will then be a [[continuous linear operator]].  A linear operator on a normed linear space is continuous if and only if it is [[bounded operator|bounded]], for example, when the domain is finite-dimensional.<ref>{{harvnb|Rudin|1991|page=15}}\n\n'''1.18 Theorem''' ''Let <math display=\"inline\">\\Lambda</math> be a linear functional on a topological vector space {{mvar|X}}. Assume <math display=\"inline\">\\Lambda x \\neq 0</math> for some <math display=\"inline\">x \\in X</math>. Then each of the following four properties implies the other three:''\n{{ordered list\n | list-style-type=lower-alpha\n | <math display=\"inline\">\\Lambda</math> is continuous\n | The null space <math display=\"inline\">N(\\Lambda)</math> is closed.\n | <math display=\"inline\">N(\\Lambda)</math> is not dense in {{mvar|X}}.\n | <math display=\"inline\">\\Lambda</math> is bounded in some neighbourhood {{mvar|V}} of 0.\n}}</ref>  An infinite-dimensional domain may have [[discontinuous linear operator]]s.\n\nAn example of an unbounded, hence discontinuous, linear transformation is differentiation on the space of smooth functions equipped with the supremum norm (a function with small values can have a derivative with large values, while the derivative of 0 is 0).  For a specific example, sin(''nx'')/''n'' converges to 0, but its derivative cos(''nx'') does not, so differentiation is not continuous at 0 (and by a variation of this argument, it is not continuous anywhere).\n\n== Applications ==\nA specific application of linear maps is for geometric transformations, such as those performed in [[computer graphics]], where the translation, rotation and scaling of 2D or 3D objects is performed by the use of a [[transformation matrix]]. Linear mappings also are used as a mechanism for describing change: for example in calculus correspond to derivatives; or in relativity, used as a device to keep track of the local transformations of reference frames.\n\nAnother application of these transformations is in [[compiler optimizations]] of nested-loop code, and in [[parallelizing compiler]] techniques.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Wikibooks|Linear Algebra/Linear Transformations}}\n* [[Antilinear map]]\n* [[Bent function]]\n* [[Bounded operator]]\n\n== Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{Cite book | last1=Halmos | first1=Paul R. | author1-link=Paul R.

In other words, it does not matter whether the linear map is applied before or after the operations of addition and scalar multiplication.\n\nThis is equivalent to requiring the same for any linear combination of vectors, i.e. that for any vectors <math display=\"inline\">\\mathbf{u}_1, \\ldots, \\mathbf{u}_n \\in V</math> and scalars <math display=\"inline\">c_1, \\ldots, c_n \\in K,</math> the following equality holds:<ref>{{harvnb|Rudin|1991|page=14}}.

Then every <math display=\"inline\">A \\in L(X, Y)</math> determines a set of numbers <math display=\"inline\">a_{i,j}</math> such that\n: <math>A\\bf{x}_j = \\sum_{i=1}^m a_{i,j}\\bf{y}_i\\quad (1 \\leq j \\leq n).</math>\n\nIt is convenient to represent these numbers in a rectangular array of {{mvar|m}} rows and {{mvar|n}} columns, called an {{mvar|m}} ''by'' {{mvar|n}} ''matrix'':\n: <math>[A] = \\begin{bmatrix}\n  a_{1,1} & a_{1,2} & \\ldots & a_{1,n} \\\\\n  a_{2,1} & a_{2,2} & \\ldots & a_{2,n} \\\\ \n   \\vdots &  \\vdots & \\ddots &  \\vdots \\\\\n  a_{m,1} & a_{m,2} & \\ldots & a_{m,n}\n\\end{bmatrix}</math>\n\nObserve that the coordinates <math display=\"inline\">a_{i,j}</math> of the vector <math display=\"inline\">A{\\bf x}_j</math> (with respect to the basis <math display=\"inline\">\\{\\bf{y}_1, \\ldots, \\bf{y}_m\\}</math>) appear in the ''j''<sup>th</sup> column of <math display=\"inline\">[A]</math>. The vectors <math display=\"inline\">A{\\bf x}_j</math> are therefore sometimes called the ''column vectors'' of <math display=\"inline\">[A]</math>. With this terminology, the ''range'' of {{mvar|A}} ''is spanned by the column vectors of <math display=\"inline\">[A]</math>''.\n</ref> This is useful because it allows concrete calculations. Matrices yield examples of linear maps: if ''A'' is a real {{nowrap|''m'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix, then {{nowrap|1=''f''('''x''') = ''A'''''x'''}} describes a linear map {{nowrap|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> \u2192 '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>}} (see [[Euclidean space]]).\n\nLet {'''v'''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, '''v'''<sub>''n''</sub>} be a basis for ''V''.  Then every vector '''v''' in ''V'' is uniquely determined by the coefficients ''c''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''c''<sub>''n''</sub> in the field '''R''':\n\n: <math>c_1 \\mathbf{v}_1 + \\cdots + c_n \\mathbf{v}_n.</math>\n\nIf {{nowrap|''f'' : ''V'' \u2192 ''W''}} is a linear map,\n\n: <math>f\\left(c_1 \\mathbf{v}_1 + \\cdots + c_n \\mathbf{v}_n\\right) = c_1 f\\left(\\mathbf{v}_1\\right) + \\cdots + c_n f\\left(\\mathbf{v}_n\\right),</math>\n\nwhich implies that the function ''f'' is entirely determined by the vectors ''f''('''v'''<sub>1</sub>), \u2026, ''f''('''v'''<sub>''n''</sub>). Now let {{nowrap|{'''w'''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, '''w'''<sub>''m''</sub>} }} be a basis for ''W''.  Then we can represent each vector ''f''('''v'''<sub>''j''</sub>) as\n\n: <math>f\\left(\\mathbf{v}_j\\right) = a_{1j} \\mathbf{w}_1 + \\cdots + a_{mj} \\mathbf{w}_m.</math>\n\nThus, the function ''f'' is entirely determined by the values of ''a''<sub>''ij''</sub>. If we put these values into an {{nowrap|''m'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix ''M'', then we can conveniently use it to compute the vector output of ''f'' for any vector in ''V''.  To get ''M'', every column ''j'' of ''M'' is a vector\n\n: <math>\\begin{pmatrix} a_{1j} & \\cdots & a_{mj} \\end{pmatrix}^\\textsf{T}</math>\n\ncorresponding to ''f''('''v'''<sub>''j''</sub>) as defined above. To define it more clearly, for some column ''j'' that corresponds to the mapping ''f''('''v'''<sub>''j''</sub>),\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{M} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n  \\ \\cdots & a_{1j} & \\cdots\\  \\\\\n           & \\vdots &          \\\\\n           & a_{mj} &\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nwhere '''M''' is the matrix of ''f''. In other words, every column {{nowrap|1=''j'' = 1, \u2026, ''n''}} has a corresponding vector ''f''('''v'''<sub>''j''</sub>) whose coordinates ''a''<sub>1''j''</sub>, \u2026, ''a''<sub>''mj''</sub> are the elements of column ''j''. A single linear map may be represented by many matrices. This is because the values of the elements of a matrix depend on the bases chosen.\n\nThe matrices of a linear transformation can be represented visually:\n\n# Matrix for <math display=\"inline\">T</math> relative to <math display=\"inline\">B</math>: <math display=\"inline\">A</math>\n# Matrix for <math display=\"inline\">T</math> relative to <math display=\"inline\">B'</math>: <math display=\"inline\">A'</math>\n# Transition matrix from <math display=\"inline\">B'</math> to <math display=\"inline\">B</math>: <math display=\"inline\">P</math>\n# Transition matrix from <math display=\"inline\">B</math> to <math display=\"inline\">B'</math>: <math display=\"inline\">P^{-1}</math>\n\n[[File:Linear_transformation_visualization.svg|The relationship between matrices in a linear transformation]]\n\nSuch that starting in the bottom left corner <math display=\"inline\">\\left[\\vec{v}\\right]_{B'}</math> and looking for the bottom right corner <math display=\"inline\">\\left[T\\left(\\vec{v}\\right)\\right]_{B'}</math>, one would left-multiply\u2014that is, <math display=\"inline\">A'\\left[\\vec{v}\\right]_{B'} = \\left[T\\left(\\vec{v}\\right)\\right]_{B'}</math>.

These are some examples:\n\n* [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]\n** by 90 degrees counterclockwise:\n**: <math>\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1\\\\ 1 & 0\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n** by an angle ''\u03b8'' counterclockwise:\n**: <math>\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & -\\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}</math>\n* [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]]\n** about the ''x'' axis:\n**: <math>\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0\\\\ 0 & -1\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n** about the ''y'' axis:\n**: <math>\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix}-1 & 0\\\\ 0 & 1\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n* [[Scaling (geometry)|scaling]] by 2 in all directions:\n*: <math>\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0\\\\ 0 & 2\\end{pmatrix} = 2\\mathbf{I}</math>\n* [[shear mapping|horizontal shear mapping]]:\n*: <math>\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & m\\\\ 0 & 1\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n* [[squeeze mapping]]:\n*: <math>\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} k & 0\\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{k}\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n* [[Projection (linear algebra)|projection]] onto the ''y'' axis:\n*: <math>\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 1\\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\n== Forming new linear maps from given ones ==\nThe composition of linear maps is linear: if {{nowrap|''f'' : ''V'' \u2192 ''W''}} and {{nowrap|''g'' : ''W'' \u2192 ''Z''}} are linear, then so is their [[Relation composition|composition]] {{nowrap|''g'' \u2218 ''f'' : ''V'' \u2192 ''Z''}}. It follows from this that the [[class (set theory)|class]] of all vector spaces over a given field ''K'', together with ''K''-linear maps as [[morphism]]s, forms a [[category (mathematics)|category]].\n\nThe [[inverse function|inverse]] of a linear map, when defined, is again a linear map.\n\nIf {{nowrap|''f''<sub>1</sub> : ''V'' \u2192 ''W''}} and {{nowrap|''f''<sub>2</sub> : ''V'' \u2192 ''W''}} are linear, then so is their [[pointwise]] sum {{nowrap|''f''<sub>1</sub> + ''f''<sub>2</sub>}} (which is defined by {{nowrap|1=(''f''<sub>1</sub> + ''f''<sub>2</sub>)('''x''') = (''f''<sub>1</sub>('''x''') + ''f''<sub>2</sub>('''x'''))}}.\n\nIf {{nowrap|''f'' : ''V'' \u2192 ''W''}} is linear and ''a'' is an element of the ground field ''K'', then the map ''af'', defined by {{nowrap|1=(''af'')('''x''') = ''a''(''f''('''x'''))}}, is also linear.\n\nThus the set {{nowrap|''L''(''V'', ''W'')}} of linear maps from ''V'' to ''W'' itself forms a vector space over ''K'', sometimes denoted {{nowrap|Hom(''V'', ''W'')}}.  Furthermore, in the case that {{nowrap|1=''V'' = ''W''}}, this vector space (denoted End(''V'')) is an [[associative algebra]] under [[composition of maps]], since the composition of two linear maps  is again a linear map, and the composition of maps is always associative.  This case is discussed in more detail below.\n\nGiven again the finite-dimensional case, if bases have been chosen, then the composition of linear maps corresponds to the [[matrix multiplication]], the addition of linear maps corresponds to the [[matrix addition]], and the multiplication of linear maps with scalars corresponds to the multiplication of matrices with scalars.\n\n== Endomorphisms and automorphisms ==\n{{main|Endomorphism|Automorphism}}\nA linear transformation ''f'': ''V'' \u2192 ''V'' is an [[endomorphism]] of ''V''; the set of all such endomorphisms End(''V'')  together with addition, composition and scalar multiplication as defined above forms an [[associative algebra]] with identity element over the field ''K'' (and in particular a [[ring (algebra)|ring]]). The multiplicative identity element of this algebra is the [[identity function|identity map]] id: ''V'' \u2192 ''V''.\n\nAn endomorphism of ''V'' that is also an [[isomorphism]] is called an [[automorphism]] of ''V''. The composition of two automorphisms is again an automorphism, and the set of all automorphisms of ''V'' forms a [[group (math)|group]], the [[automorphism group]] of ''V'' which is denoted by Aut(''V'') or GL(''V''). Since the automorphisms are precisely those [[endomorphisms]] which possess inverses under composition, Aut(''V'') is the group of [[Unit (ring theory)|units]] in the ring End(''V'').\n\nIf ''V'' has finite dimension ''n'', then End(''V'') is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[associative algebra]] of all ''n'' \u00d7 ''n'' matrices with entries in ''K''. The automorphism group of ''V'' is [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the  [[general linear group]] GL(''n'', ''K'') of all ''n'' \u00d7 ''n'' invertible matrices with entries in ''K''.\n\n== Kernel, image and the rank\u2013nullity theorem ==\n{{main|Kernel (linear operator)|Image (mathematics)|Rank of a matrix}}\nIf ''f'' : ''V'' \u2192 ''W'' is linear, we define the [[kernel (linear operator)|kernel]] and the [[image (mathematics)|image]] or [[range (mathematics)|range]] of ''f'' by\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n    \\ker(f) &= \\{\\,x \\in V: f(x) = 0\\,\\} \\\\\n    \\operatorname{im}(f) &= \\{\\,w \\in W: w = f(x), x \\in V\\,\\}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nker(''f'') is a [[Linear subspace|subspace]] of ''V'' and im(''f'') is a subspace of ''W''.  The following [[dimension]] formula is known as the [[rank\u2013nullity theorem]]:\n\n: <math>\\dim(\\ker( f )) + \\dim(\\operatorname{im}( f )) = \\dim( V ).</math><ref>{{harvnb|Horn|Johnson|2013|loc=0.2.3 Vector spaces associated with a matrix or linear transformation, p. 6}}</ref>\n\nThe number dim(im(''f'')) is also called the ''rank of f'' and written as rank(''f''), or sometimes, \u03c1(''f''); the number dim(ker(''f'')) is called the ''nullity of f'' and written as null(''f'') or \u03bd(''f''). If ''V'' and ''W'' are finite-dimensional, bases have been chosen and ''f'' is represented by the matrix ''A'', then the rank and nullity of ''f'' are equal to the [[rank of a matrix|rank]] and [[Kernel (matrix)#Subspace properties|nullity]] of the matrix ''A'', respectively.\n\n== Cokernel ==\n{{main|Cokernel}}\n\nA subtler invariant of a linear transformation <math display=\"inline\">f: V \\to W</math> is the [[cokernel|''co''kernel]], which is defined as\n\n: <math>\\operatorname{coker}(f) := W/f(V) = W/\\operatorname{im}(f).</math>\n\nThis is the ''dual'' notion to the kernel: just as the kernel is a ''sub''space of the ''domain,'' the co-kernel is a [[quotient space (linear algebra)|''quotient'' space]] of the ''target.''\nFormally, one has the [[exact sequence]]\n\n: <math>0 \\to \\ker(f) \\to V \\to W \\to \\operatorname{coker}(f) \\to 0.</math>\n\nThese can be interpreted thus: given a linear equation ''f''('''v''') = '''w''' to solve,\n\n* the kernel is the space of ''solutions'' to the ''homogeneous'' equation ''f''('''v''') = 0, and its dimension is the number of ''degrees of freedom'' in a solution, if it exists;\n* the co-kernel is the space of ''constraints'' that must be satisfied if the equation is to have a solution, and its dimension is the number of constraints that must be satisfied for the equation to have a solution.\n\nThe dimension of the co-kernel and the dimension of the image (the rank) add up to the dimension of the target space. For finite dimensions, this means that the dimension of the quotient space ''W''/''f''(''V'') is the dimension of the target space minus the dimension of the image.\n\nAs a simple example, consider the map ''f'': '''R'''<sup>2</sup> \u2192 '''R'''<sup>2</sup>, given by ''f''(''x'', ''y'') = (0, ''y''). Then for an equation ''f''(''x'', ''y'') = (''a'', ''b'') to have a solution, we must have ''a'' = 0 (one constraint), and in that case the solution space is (''x'', ''b'')  or equivalently stated, (0, ''b'') + (''x'', 0), (one degree of freedom). The kernel may be expressed as the subspace (''x'', 0) < ''V'': the value of ''x'' is the freedom in a solution \u2013 while the cokernel may be expressed via the map ''W'' \u2192 '''R''', <math display=\"inline\"> (a, b) \\mapsto (a):</math> given a vector (''a'', ''b''), the value of ''a'' is the ''obstruction'' to there being a solution.\n\nAn example illustrating the infinite-dimensional case is afforded by the map ''f'': '''R'''<sup>\u221e</sup> \u2192 '''R'''<sup>\u221e</sup>, <math display=\"inline\">\\left\\{a_n\\right\\} \\mapsto \\left\\{b_n\\right\\}</math> with ''b''<sub>1</sub> = 0 and ''b''<sub>''n'' + 1</sub> = ''a<sub>n</sub>'' for ''n'' > 0. Its image consists of all sequences with first element 0, and thus its cokernel consists of the classes of sequences with identical first element. Thus, whereas its kernel has dimension 0 (it maps only the zero sequence to the zero sequence), its co-kernel has dimension 1. Since the domain and the target space are the same, the rank and the dimension of the kernel add up to the same [[cardinal number#Cardinal addition|sum]] as the rank and the dimension of the co-kernel ( <math display=\"inline\">\\aleph_0 + 0 = \\aleph_0 + 1</math> ), but in the infinite-dimensional case it cannot be inferred that the kernel and the co-kernel of an [[endomorphism]] have the same dimension (0 \u2260 1). The reverse situation obtains for the map ''h'': '''R'''<sup>\u221e</sup> \u2192 '''R'''<sup>\u221e</sup>, <math display=\"inline\">\\left\\{a_n\\right\\} \\mapsto \\left\\{c_n\\right\\}</math> with ''c<sub>n</sub>'' = ''a''<sub>''n'' + 1</sub>. Its image is the entire target space, and hence its co-kernel has dimension 0, but since it maps all sequences in which only the first element is non-zero to the zero sequence, its kernel has dimension 1.\n\n=== Index ===\nFor a linear operator with finite-dimensional kernel and co-kernel, one may define  ''index'' as:\n\n: <math>\\operatorname{ind}(f) := \\dim(\\ker(f)) - \\dim(\\operatorname{coker}(f)),</math>\n\nnamely the degrees of freedom minus the number of constraints.\n\nFor a transformation between finite-dimensional vector spaces, this is just the difference dim(''V'') \u2212 dim(''W''), by rank\u2013nullity. This gives an indication of how many solutions or how many constraints one has: if mapping from a larger space to a smaller one, the map may be onto, and thus will have degrees of freedom even without constraints. Conversely, if mapping from a smaller space to a larger one, the map cannot be onto, and thus one will have constraints even without degrees of freedom.\n\nThe index of an operator is precisely the [[Euler characteristic]] of the 2-term complex 0 \u2192 ''V'' \u2192 ''W'' \u2192 0. In [[operator theory]], the index of [[Fredholm operator]]s is an object of study, with a major result being the [[Atiyah\u2013Singer index theorem]].<ref>{{SpringerEOM|title=Index theory|id=Index_theory&oldid=23864|first=Victor|last=Nistor}}: \"The main question in index theory is to provide index formulas for classes of Fredholm operators ... Index theory has become a subject on its own only after M. F. Atiyah and I. Singer published their index theorems\"</ref>\n\n== Algebraic classifications of linear transformations ==\nNo classification of linear maps could hope to be exhaustive. The following incomplete list enumerates some important classifications that do not require any additional structure on the vector space.\n\nLet ''V'' and ''W'' denote vector spaces over a field, ''F''. Let ''T'': ''V'' \u2192 ''W'' be a linear map.\n\n* ''T'' is said to be ''[[injective]]'' or a ''[[monomorphism]]'' if any of the following equivalent conditions are true:\n** ''T'' is [[injective|one-to-one]] as a map of [[set (mathematics)|sets]].\n** ker''T'' = {0<sub>''V''</sub>}\n** dim(ker''T'') = 0\n** ''T'' is [[monic morphism|monic]] or left-cancellable, which is to say, for any vector space ''U'' and any pair of linear maps ''R'': ''U'' \u2192 ''V'' and ''S'': ''U'' \u2192 ''V'', the equation ''TR'' = ''TS'' implies ''R'' = ''S''.\n** ''T'' is [[inverse (ring theory)|left-invertible]], which is to say there exists a linear map ''S'': ''W'' \u2192 ''V'' such that ''ST'' is the [[Identity function|identity map]] on ''V''.\n* ''T'' is said to be ''[[surjective]]'' or an ''[[epimorphism]]'' if any of the following equivalent conditions are true:\n** ''T'' is [[surjective|onto]] as a map of sets.\n** [[cokernel|coker]] ''T'' = {0<sub>''W''</sub>}\n** ''T'' is [[epimorphism|epic]] or right-cancellable, which is to say, for any vector space ''U'' and any pair of linear maps ''R'': ''W'' \u2192 ''U'' and ''S'': ''W'' \u2192 ''U'', the equation ''RT'' = ''ST'' implies ''R'' = ''S''.\n** ''T'' is [[inverse (ring theory)|right-invertible]], which is to say there exists a linear map ''S'': ''W'' \u2192 ''V'' such that ''TS'' is the [[Identity function|identity map]] on ''W''.\n* ''T'' is said to be an ''[[isomorphism]]'' if it is both left- and right-invertible. This is equivalent to ''T'' being both one-to-one and onto (a [[bijection]] of sets) or also to ''T'' being both epic and monic, and so being a [[bimorphism]].\n* If ''T'': ''V'' \u2192 ''V'' is an endomorphism, then:\n** If, for some positive integer ''n'', the ''n''-th iterate of ''T'', ''T<sup>n</sup>'', is identically zero, then ''T'' is said to be [[nilpotent]].\n** If ''T''<sup>2</sup> = ''T'', then ''T'' is said to be [[idempotent]]\n** If ''T'' = ''kI'', where ''k'' is some scalar, then ''T'' is said to be a scaling transformation or scalar multiplication map; see [[scalar matrix]].\n\n== Change of basis ==\n{{main|Basis (linear algebra)|Change of basis}}\nGiven a linear map which is an [[endomorphism]] whose matrix is ''A'', in the basis ''B'' of the space it transforms vector coordinates [u] as [v] = ''A''[u]. As vectors change with the inverse of ''B'' (vectors are [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]]) its inverse transformation is [v] = ''B''[v'].\n\nSubstituting this in the first expression\n:<math>B\\left[v'\\right] = AB\\left[u'\\right]</math>\n\nhence\n:<math>\\left[v'\\right] = B^{-1}AB\\left[u'\\right] = A'\\left[u'\\right].</math>\n\nTherefore, the matrix in the new basis is ''A\u2032'' = ''B''<sup>\u22121</sup>''AB'', being ''B'' the matrix of the given basis.\n\nTherefore, linear maps are said to be 1-co- 1-contra-[[covariance and contravariance of vectors|variant]] objects, or type (1, 1) [[tensor]]s.\n\n== Continuity ==\n{{main|Discontinuous linear map}}\n\nA ''linear transformation'' between [[topological vector space]]s, for example [[normed space]]s, may be [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]].  If its domain and codomain are the same, it will then be a [[continuous linear operator]].  A linear operator on a normed linear space is continuous if and only if it is [[bounded operator|bounded]], for example, when the domain is finite-dimensional.<ref>{{harvnb|Rudin|1991|page=15}}\n\n'''1.18 Theorem''' ''Let <math display=\"inline\">\\Lambda</math> be a linear functional on a topological vector space {{mvar|X}}. Assume <math display=\"inline\">\\Lambda x \\neq 0</math> for some <math display=\"inline\">x \\in X</math>. Then each of the following four properties implies the other three:\n{{ordered list\n | list-style-type=lower-alpha\n | <math display=\"inline\">\\Lambda</math> is continuous\n | The null space <math display=\"inline\">N(\\Lambda)</math> is closed.\n | <math display=\"inline\">N(\\Lambda)</math> is not dense in {{mvar|X}}.\n | <math display=\"inline\">\\Lambda</math> is bounded in some neighbourhood {{mvar|V}} of 0.\n}}</ref>  An infinite-dimensional domain may have [[discontinuous linear operator]]s.\n\nAn example of an unbounded, hence discontinuous, linear transformation is differentiation on the space of smooth functions equipped with the supremum norm (a function with small values can have a derivative with large values, while the derivative of 0 is 0).  For a specific example, sin(''nx'')/''n'' converges to 0, but its derivative cos(''nx'') does not, so differentiation is not continuous at 0 (and by a variation of this argument, it is not continuous anywhere).\n\n== Applications ==\nA specific application of linear maps is for geometric transformations, such as those performed in [[computer graphics]], where the translation, rotation and scaling of 2D or 3D objects is performed by the use of a [[transformation matrix]]. Linear mappings also are used as a mechanism for describing change: for example in calculus correspond to derivatives; or in relativity, used as a device to keep track of the local transformations of reference frames.\n\nAnother application of these transformations is in [[compiler optimizations]] of nested-loop code, and in [[parallelizing compiler]] techniques.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Wikibooks|Linear Algebra/Linear Transformations}}\n* [[Antilinear map]]\n* [[Bent function]]\n* [[Bounded operator]]\n\n== Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{Cite book | last1=Halmos | first1=Paul R. | author1-link=Paul R.

Featuring [[Jim Henson|Jim Henson's]] [[Muppets]], animation, [[Short film|live shorts]], humor and celebrity appearances, it was the first television program of its kind to base its content and production values on laboratory and formative research, and the first to include a curriculum \"detailed or stated in terms of measurable outcomes\".<ref name=\"palmer\">Palmer & Fisch in Fisch & Truglio, p. 9</ref> Initial responses to the show included adulatory reviews, some controversy<ref name=\"morrow-3\">Morrow, p. 3</ref> and high [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]]. By its 40th anniversary in 2009, ''Sesame Street'' was broadcast in over 120 countries, and 20 independent international versions had been produced.<ref name=\"gov\">{{cite web | last = Friedman | first = Michael Jay | title = Sesame Street Educates and Entertains Internationally: Honored Children's Show Honored Throughout the World | work = America.gov | date = April 8, 2006 | url = http://iipdigital.usembassy.gov/st/english/article/2006/04/20060405165756jmnamdeirf0.4207117.html#axzz2gmvoKT7B | accessdate = April 9, 2019}}</ref> It has won eleven [[Grammys]] and over 150 [[Emmys]] in its history\u2014more than any other children's show.\n\nThe show was conceived in 1966 during discussions between television producer [[Joan Ganz Cooney]] and [[Carnegie Corporation]] vice president [[Lloyd Morrisett]]. Their goal was to create a [[children's television show]] that would \"master the addictive qualities of television and do something good with them\",<ref name=\"Davis, p. 8\"/> such as helping young children prepare for school. After two years of research, the newly formed Children's Television Workshop (CTW) received a combined grant of $8 million from the Carnegie Corporation, the [[Ford Foundation]] and the U.S. federal government to create and produce a new children's television show.\n\nBy the show's tenth anniversary in 1979, nine million American children under the age of six were watching ''Sesame Street'' daily, and several studies showed it was having a positive educational impact. The cast and crew expanded during this time, including the hiring of women in the crew and additional minorities in the cast. In 1981, the federal government withdrew its funding, so the CTW turned to other sources, such as its magazine division, book royalties, product licensing and foreign income. During the 1980s, ''Sesame Street''{{'}}s curriculum expanded to include topics such as relationships, ethics and emotions. Many of the show's storylines were taken from the experiences of its writing staff, cast and crew, most notably the death of [[Will Lee]]\u2014who played [[Mr. Hooper]]\u2014and the marriage of Luis and Maria.\n\nIn recent decades, ''Sesame Street'' has faced societal and economic challenges, including changes in the viewing habits of young children, more competition from other shows, the development of cable television and a drop in ratings. After the turn of the 21st century, the show made major structural adaptations, including changing its traditional magazine format to a narrative format. Because of the popularity of the Muppet [[Elmo]], the show incorporated a popular segment known as \"[[Elmo's World]]\". In late 2015, in response to \"sweeping changes in the media business\",<ref name=\"movetohbo\"/> [[HBO]] began airing first-run episodes of ''Sesame Street''. Episodes became available on PBS stations and websites nine months after they aired on HBO. As of its 50th anniversary in 2019, ''Sesame Street'' has produced over 4,500 episodes, 35 TV specials, 200 home videos, and 180 albums. Its YouTube channel had almost 5 million subscribers, and the show had 24 million followers on social media.\n\n==Background==\nIn the late 1960s, 97% of all American households owned a television set, and preschool children watched an average of 27 hours of television per week;<ref name=\"Hellman-50\">Hellman, p. 50</ref> programs created for them were widely criticized for being too violent and for reflecting commercial values.<ref name=\"Unpaved-9\">Borgenicht, p. 9</ref><ref name=\"newsweek\">{{cite news | last = Guernsey | first = Lisa | title = How Sesame Street Changed the World | work = Newsweek | date = May 22, 2009 | url = http://www.newsweek.com/2009/05/22/sesame-street.html | accessdate = March 26, 2019}}</ref> Producer [[Joan Ganz Cooney]] called children's programming a \"wasteland\", and she was not alone in her criticism.<ref>{{cite book | last = Cooney | first = Joan Ganz | editor = Gerald S.

This was because the producers had followed the advice of child psychologists who were concerned that children would be confused if human actors and Muppets were shown together. As a result of this decision, the appeal of the test episodes was lower than the target.<ref name=\"Fisch-39\"/><ref>Gladwell, p. 105</ref>\n\nThe Street scenes, as Palmer described them, were \"the glue\" that \"pulled the show together\",<ref name=\"Gladwell-106\">Gladwell, p. 106</ref> so producers knew they needed to make significant changes. On the basis of their experience on ''Captain Kangaroo'', Cannell, Stone, and Gibbon thought the experts' opinions were \"nonsense\";<ref>Davis, p. 363</ref> Cooney agreed.<ref name=\"Borgenicht, p. 16\"/> Lesser called their decision to defy the recommendations of their advisers \"a turning point in the history of ''Sesame Street''\".<ref name=\"Gladwell-106\"/> The producers reshot the Street segments; Henson and his coworkers created Muppets that could interact with the human actors,<ref name=\"Gladwell-106\"/><ref>Fisch & Bernstein, pp. 39\u201340</ref> specifically [[Oscar the Grouch]] and [[Big Bird]], who became two of the show's most enduring characters.<ref name=\"Fisch & Bernstein, p. 40\"/> In addition, the producers found Saunders' role as Gordon not to be as likable by children watching the show, resulting in the character being recast by [[Matt Robinson (actor)|Matt Robinson]], who was initially the show's filmed segments producer. These test episodes were directly responsible for what Gladwell called \"the essence of ''Sesame Street''\u2014the artful blend of fluffy monsters and earnest adults\".<ref name=\"Gladwell-106\"/>{{refn|Lesser later reported that there was no evidence this combination of fantasy and reality confused children, but rather held \"considerable appeal\".<ref>Lesser, p. 130</ref>|group=note}}\n\n==Premiere and first season (1969\u20131970)==\nTwo days before the show's premiere, a thirty-minute preview entitled ''This Way to Sesame Street'' aired on [[NBC]].

Segments that featured children became more spontaneous and allowed more impromptu dialogue, even when it meant cutting other segments.<ref name=\"bigbadtv\"/> Since federal funds had been used to produce the show, more segments of the population insisted upon being represented on ''Sesame Street''; for example, the show was criticized by Hispanic groups for the lack of Latino characters in the early years of production.<ref name=\"newsweek\"/> A committee of Hispanic activists, commissioned by the CTW in 1970, called ''Sesame Street'' \"racist\" and said the show's bilingual aspects were of \"poor quality and patronizing\".<ref name=\"morrow-3\"/> The CTW responded to these critics by hiring Hispanic actors, production staff, and researchers. By the mid-70s, Morrow reported that \"the show included Chicano and Puerto Rican cast members, films about Mexican holidays and foods, and cartoons that taught Spanish words\".<ref>Morrow, p. 155</ref>\n\nWhile ''New York Magazine'' reported criticism of the presence of strong single women in the show, organizations like the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW) expressed concerns that the show needed to be \"less male-oriented\".<ref name=\"Hellman-52\"/><ref name=\"bigbadtv\"/> For example, members of NOW took exception to the character Susan, who was originally a housewife.<ref>Davis, p. 213</ref> They complained about the lack of, as Morrow put it, \"credible female Muppets\" on the show; Morrow reported that Henson's response was that \"women might not be strong enough to hold the puppets over the long hours of taping\".<ref>Morrow, p. 84</ref> The show's producers responded by making Susan a nurse and by hiring a female writer.<ref name=\"bigbadtv\"/>\n\n==1970s==\nBy the mid-1970s, ''Sesame Street'', according to Davis, had become \"an American institution\".<ref name=\"Davis-220\">Davis, p. 220</ref> ETS conducted two \"landmark\"<ref name=\"Mielke-88\">Mielke in Fisch & Truglio, p. 88</ref> studies of the show in 1970 and 1971 which demonstrated ''Sesame Street'' had a positive educational impact on its viewers.<ref name=\"Mielke-88\"/> The results of these studies led to the producers securing funding for the show over the next several years,<ref name=\"Davis-220\"/> and provided the CTW with additional ways to promote it. By the second season, ''Sesame Street'' had become so popular that the design of ETS' experiments to track the show's educational outcomes had to be changed:<ref>Mielke in Fisch & Truglio, p. 86</ref> instead of comparing viewers with a control group of non-viewers, the researchers studied the differences among levels of viewing. They found that children who watched ''Sesame Street'' more frequently had a higher comprehension of the material presented.<ref>Mielke in Fisch & Truglio, pp. 86\u201387</ref>\n\nProducer Jon Stone was instrumental in guiding the show during these years. According to Davis, Stone \"gave ''Sesame Street'' its soul\";<ref name=\"Davis-220\"/> without him \"there would not have been ''Sesame Street'' as we know it\".<ref>Davis, p. 271</ref> [[Frank Oz]] regarded Stone as \"the father of ''Sesame Street''\",<ref name=\"Gikow-24\">Gikow, p. 24</ref> and Cooney considered Stone \"the key creative talent on ''Sesame Street''<ref name=\"Gikow-24\"/> and \"probably the most brilliant writer of children's material in America\".<ref name=\"Gikow-24\"/> Stone was able to recognize and mentor talented people for his crew. He actively hired and promoted women during a time when few women earned top production jobs in television. His policies provided the show with a succession of female producers and writers, many of whom went on to lead the boom in children's programming at [[Nickelodeon (TV network)|Nickelodeon]], the [[Disney Channel]], and PBS in the 1990s and 2000s. One of these women was [[Dulcy Singer]], who later became the first female executive producer of ''Sesame Street''.<ref>Davis, p. 221</ref>\n\nAfter the show's initial success, its producers began to think about its survival beyond its development and first season and decided to explore other funding sources.<ref>Davis, p. 203</ref> The CTW decided to depend upon government agencies and private foundations to develop the show. This would protect it from the financial pressures experienced by commercial networks, but created problems in finding continued support.<ref name=\"Lesser-17\"/> This era in the show's history was marked by conflicts between the CTW and the federal government; in 1978, the U.S. Department of Education refused to deliver a $2 million check until the last day of the CTW's fiscal year. As a result, the CTW decided to depend upon licensing arrangements, publishing, and international sales for its funding.<ref name=\"odell\">O'Dell, pp. 73\u201374</ref> Henson owned the [[trademarks]] to the Muppet characters: he was reluctant to market them at first, but agreed when the CTW promised that the profits from toys, books, and other products were to be used exclusively to fund the CTW. The producers demanded complete control over all products and product decisions; any product line associated with the show had to be educational, inexpensive, and not advertised during its airings.<ref>Davis, pp. 203\u2013205</ref> The CTW approached [[Random House]] to establish and manage a non-broadcast materials division. Random House and the CTW named [[Christopher Cerf (musician and television producer)|Christopher Cerf]] to assist the CTW in publishing books and other materials that emphasized the curriculum.<ref>Davis, p. 205</ref> In 1980, the CTW began to produce a touring stage production based upon the show, written by Connell and performed by the [[Ice Follies]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Hoover | first = Bob | title = 'Sesame Street' Success Travels Well on the Road | work = Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | page = 13 | date = January 16, 1988 | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1129&dat=19880116&id=6lMNAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4W0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6033,4162471 | accessdate = March 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote box\n|width     = 30em\n|border    = 1px\n|align     = right\n|bgcolor   = #c6dbf7\n|fontsize  = 85%\n|title_bg  =\n|title_fnt =\n|title     =\n|quote     = \"To be frank, I was really surprised, because we thought we were creating the quintessential American show.

In 1982, Will Lee, who had played [[Mr. Hooper]] since the show's premiere, died. For the 1983 season, the show's producers and research staff decided they would explain Mr. Hooper's death to their preschool audience, instead of recasting the role: the writer of that episode, [[Norman Stiles]], said, \"We felt we owed something to a man we respected and loved\".<ref name=\"Hellman-52\"/> They convened a group of psychologists, religious leaders, and other experts in the field of grief, loss, and separation. The research team conducted a series of studies before the episode to ascertain if children were able to understand the messages they wanted to convey about Mr. Hooper's death; the research showed most children did understand.

For the first time since the show debuted, the producers and a team of researchers analyzed ''Sesame Street''{{'s}} content and structure during a series of two-week-long workshops. They also studied how children's viewing habits had changed since the show's premiere. They found that although ''Sesame Street'' was produced for three -to five-year olds, children began watching it at a younger age. Preschool television had become more competitive, and the CTW's research showed the traditional magazine format was not the best way to attract young children's attention. The growth of home videos during the '80s and the increase of thirty-minute children's shows on cable had demonstrated that children's attention could be sustained for longer periods of time, but the CTW's researchers found that their viewers, especially the younger ones, lost attention in ''Sesame Street'' after 40 to 45 minutes.<ref>Davis, p. 338</ref><ref>Fisch & Bernstein, in Fisch & Truglio, pp. 44\u201345</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1998, a new 15-minute segment shown at the end of each episode, \"[[Elmo's World]]\", used traditional elements (animation, Muppets, music, and live-action film), but had a more sustained narrative.<ref>Fisch & Bernstein in Fisch & Truglio, p. 45</ref> \"Elmo's World\" followed the same structure each episode, and depended heavily on repetition.<ref name=\"works\">{{cite web | last = Whitlock | first = Natalie Walker | title = How Elmo Works | work = How Stuff Works | url = http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/how-elmo-works2.htm | accessdate = April 8, 2019}}</ref>{{refn|At first, the same segment was repeated daily for a week, but this practice was dropped at the end of the first season of \"Elmo's World\".<ref name=\"works\"/>|group=note}}  Unlike the realism of the rest of the show, the segment took place in a stylized crayon-drawing universe as conceived by its host.<ref>Clash, p. 75</ref> [[Elmo]], who represented the three- to four-year-old child, was chosen as host of the closing segment because he had always tested well with this segment of their audience.<ref name=\"works\"/> He was created in 1980 and originally performed by [[Brian Muehl]], and later Richard Hunt, but did not become what his eventual portrayer, [[Kevin Clash]], called a \"phenomenon\"<ref name=\"Unpaved-9\"/> until Clash took over the role in 1985.<ref>Davis, p. 285</ref> Eventually, Elmo became, as Davis reported, \"the embodiment\" of ''Sesame Street'', and \"the marketing wonder of our age\"<ref>Davis, p. 349</ref> when five million \"[[Tickle Me Elmo]]\" dolls were sold in 1996.

The cast and crew expanded during this time, including the hiring of women in the crew and additional minorities in the cast. In 1981, the federal government withdrew its funding, so the CTW turned to other sources, such as its magazine division, book royalties, product licensing and foreign income. During the 1980s, ''Sesame Street''{{'}}s curriculum expanded to include topics such as relationships, ethics and emotions. Many of the show's storylines were taken from the experiences of its writing staff, cast and crew, most notably the death of [[Will Lee]]\u2014who played [[Mr. Hooper]]\u2014and the marriage of Luis and Maria.\n\nIn recent decades, ''Sesame Street'' has faced societal and economic challenges, including changes in the viewing habits of young children, more competition from other shows, the development of cable television and a drop in ratings. After the turn of the 21st century, the show made major structural adaptations, including changing its traditional magazine format to a narrative format. Because of the popularity of the Muppet [[Elmo]], the show incorporated a popular segment known as \"[[Elmo's World]]\". In late 2015, in response to \"sweeping changes in the media business\",<ref name=\"movetohbo\"/> [[HBO]] began airing first-run episodes of ''Sesame Street''. Episodes became available on PBS stations and websites nine months after they aired on HBO. As of its 50th anniversary in 2019, ''Sesame Street'' has produced over 4,500 episodes, 35 TV specials, 200 home videos, and 180 albums. Its YouTube channel had almost 5 million subscribers, and the show had 24 million followers on social media.\n\n==Background==\nIn the late 1960s, 97% of all American households owned a television set, and preschool children watched an average of 27 hours of television per week;<ref name=\"Hellman-50\">Hellman, p. 50</ref> programs created for them were widely criticized for being too violent and for reflecting commercial values.<ref name=\"Unpaved-9\">Borgenicht, p. 9</ref><ref name=\"newsweek\">{{cite news | last = Guernsey | first = Lisa | title = How Sesame Street Changed the World | work = Newsweek | date = May 22, 2009 | url = http://www.newsweek.com/2009/05/22/sesame-street.html | accessdate = March 26, 2019}}</ref> Producer [[Joan Ganz Cooney]] called children's programming a \"wasteland\", and she was not alone in her criticism.<ref>{{cite book | last = Cooney | first = Joan Ganz | editor = Gerald S.

Segments that featured children became more spontaneous and allowed more impromptu dialogue, even when it meant cutting other segments.<ref name=\"bigbadtv\"/> Since federal funds had been used to produce the show, more segments of the population insisted upon being represented on ''Sesame Street''; for example, the show was criticized by Hispanic groups for the lack of Latino characters in the early years of production.<ref name=\"newsweek\"/> A committee of Hispanic activists, commissioned by the CTW in 1970, called ''Sesame Street'' \"racist\" and said the show's bilingual aspects were of \"poor quality and patronizing\".<ref name=\"morrow-3\"/> The CTW responded to these critics by hiring Hispanic actors, production staff, and researchers.

By the second season, ''Sesame Street'' had become so popular that the design of ETS' experiments to track the show's educational outcomes had to be changed:<ref>Mielke in Fisch & Truglio, p. 86</ref> instead of comparing viewers with a control group of non-viewers, the researchers studied the differences among levels of viewing. They found that children who watched ''Sesame Street'' more frequently had a higher comprehension of the material presented.<ref>Mielke in Fisch & Truglio, pp. 86\u201387</ref>\n\nProducer Jon Stone was instrumental in guiding the show during these years. According to Davis, Stone \"gave ''Sesame Street'' its soul\";<ref name=\"Davis-220\"/> without him \"there would not have been ''Sesame Street'' as we know it\".<ref>Davis, p. 271</ref> [[Frank Oz]] regarded Stone as \"the father of ''Sesame Street''\",<ref name=\"Gikow-24\">Gikow, p. 24</ref> and Cooney considered Stone \"the key creative talent on ''Sesame Street''<ref name=\"Gikow-24\"/> and \"probably the most brilliant writer of children's material in America\".<ref name=\"Gikow-24\"/> Stone was able to recognize and mentor talented people for his crew. He actively hired and promoted women during a time when few women earned top production jobs in television. His policies provided the show with a succession of female producers and writers, many of whom went on to lead the boom in children's programming at [[Nickelodeon (TV network)|Nickelodeon]], the [[Disney Channel]], and PBS in the 1990s and 2000s. One of these women was [[Dulcy Singer]], who later became the first female executive producer of ''Sesame Street''.<ref>Davis, p. 221</ref>\n\nAfter the show's initial success, its producers began to think about its survival beyond its development and first season and decided to explore other funding sources.<ref>Davis, p. 203</ref> The CTW decided to depend upon government agencies and private foundations to develop the show. This would protect it from the financial pressures experienced by commercial networks, but created problems in finding continued support.<ref name=\"Lesser-17\"/> This era in the show's history was marked by conflicts between the CTW and the federal government; in 1978, the U.S. Department of Education refused to deliver a $2 million check until the last day of the CTW's fiscal year. As a result, the CTW decided to depend upon licensing arrangements, publishing, and international sales for its funding.<ref name=\"odell\">O'Dell, pp. 73\u201374</ref> Henson owned the [[trademarks]] to the Muppet characters: he was reluctant to market them at first, but agreed when the CTW promised that the profits from toys, books, and other products were to be used exclusively to fund the CTW. The producers demanded complete control over all products and product decisions; any product line associated with the show had to be educational, inexpensive, and not advertised during its airings.<ref>Davis, pp. 203\u2013205</ref> The CTW approached [[Random House]] to establish and manage a non-broadcast materials division. Random House and the CTW named [[Christopher Cerf (musician and television producer)|Christopher Cerf]] to assist the CTW in publishing books and other materials that emphasized the curriculum.<ref>Davis, p. 205</ref> In 1980, the CTW began to produce a touring stage production based upon the show, written by Connell and performed by the [[Ice Follies]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Hoover | first = Bob | title = 'Sesame Street' Success Travels Well on the Road | work = Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | page = 13 | date = January 16, 1988 | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1129&dat=19880116&id=6lMNAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4W0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6033,4162471 | accessdate = March 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote box\n|width     = 30em\n|border    = 1px\n|align     = right\n|bgcolor   = #c6dbf7\n|fontsize  = 85%\n|title_bg  =\n|title_fnt =\n|title     =\n|quote     = \"To be frank, I was really surprised, because we thought we were creating the quintessential American show.

In 1982, Will Lee, who had played [[Mr. Hooper]] since the show's premiere, died.

For the first time since the show debuted, the producers and a team of researchers analyzed ''Sesame Street''{{'s}} content and structure during a series of two-week-long workshops. They also studied how children's viewing habits had changed since the show's premiere. They found that although ''Sesame Street'' was produced for three -to five-year olds, children began watching it at a younger age. Preschool television had become more competitive, and the CTW's research showed the traditional magazine format was not the best way to attract young children's attention. The growth of home videos during the '80s and the increase of thirty-minute children's shows on cable had demonstrated that children's attention could be sustained for longer periods of time, but the CTW's researchers found that their viewers, especially the younger ones, lost attention in ''Sesame Street'' after 40 to 45 minutes.<ref>Davis, p. 338</ref><ref>Fisch & Bernstein, in Fisch & Truglio, pp. 44\u201345</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1998, a new 15-minute segment shown at the end of each episode, \"[[Elmo's World]]\", used traditional elements (animation, Muppets, music, and live-action film), but had a more sustained narrative.<ref>Fisch & Bernstein in Fisch & Truglio, p. 45</ref> \"Elmo's World\" followed the same structure each episode, and depended heavily on repetition.<ref name=\"works\">{{cite web | last = Whitlock | first = Natalie Walker | title = How Elmo Works | work = How Stuff Works | url = http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/how-elmo-works2.htm | accessdate = April 8, 2019}}</ref>{{refn|At first, the same segment was repeated daily for a week, but this practice was dropped at the end of the first season of \"Elmo's World\".<ref name=\"works\"/>|group=note}}  Unlike the realism of the rest of the show, the segment took place in a stylized crayon-drawing universe as conceived by its host.<ref>Clash, p. 75</ref> [[Elmo]], who represented the three- to four-year-old child, was chosen as host of the closing segment because he had always tested well with this segment of their audience.<ref name=\"works\"/> He was created in 1980 and originally performed by [[Brian Muehl]], and later Richard Hunt, but did not become what his eventual portrayer, [[Kevin Clash]], called a \"phenomenon\"<ref name=\"Unpaved-9\"/> until Clash took over the role in 1985.<ref>Davis, p. 285</ref> Eventually, Elmo became, as Davis reported, \"the embodiment\" of ''Sesame Street'', and \"the marketing wonder of our age\"<ref>Davis, p. 349</ref> when five million \"[[Tickle Me Elmo]]\" dolls were sold in 1996.
