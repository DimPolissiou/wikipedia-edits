American Historian [[Albert T. Olmstead]] describes in his work \"''History of the Persian Empire''\" how the [[Persians|Persian]] General Vaumisa wins a battle in the Autiyara districts located in Tyari and mentions that this is where the Assyrian Christians of the Tyari tribe maintained their independence.<ref>Olmstead, Albert T. (1970). ''History of the Persian Empire''. University of Chicago Press, p. 114</ref>  \n\nIn Classical [[Syriac language|Syriac]] the word Tyare is the plural form of a sheepfold, or grazing area. Indeed, the Assyrians of Tyare were renowned even amongst neighboring Kurds and [[Armenians]] for their [[yogurt]], [[cheese]] and other dairy products mostly made from [[sheep]] or [[goat milk|goat's milk]]. They were also famous for their [[textiles]]<ref name=\":0\" />, which again were spun and woven from sheep's wool. They also made woolen felt for their characteristic conical caps<ref>{{Cite book|last=Layard, Austen Henry, 1817-1894.|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/12578949|title=Nineveh and Its Remains|date=1858|publisher=Appleton|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=194|oclc=12578949}}</ref>, and felt was also used for bedding.\n\nThese industries have continued to some extent in their rural settlements in Northern Iraq and North East Syria. One anecdote mentions that, on the flight of Assyrians from Urmia, Iran to Bakuba, Iraq in 1918, the Tyare Assyrians reached the end of the thousand mile trek with more sheep than when they had originally set out.\n\n\n==Dialect==\n[[File:Tyariaccent.ogg|thumb|right|Sample of the Tyare dialect. Notice the usage of [\u03b8], [\u00f0] and [aw], and also the analytic approach regarding [[Possession (linguistics)|possession]] (''otax'd deyeh'', \"bedroom of his\").]]\nLike [[Jilu#Neo-Aramaic dialect of J\u012bl\u016b|J\u012bl\u016b]], the Tyare dialect is a very distinct [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]] dialect. Unlike the ''Jilu'', ''Baz'' and ''Gawar'' dialects (which are very similar to each other), this one is more \"thick\". It is, in a way, a sort of a \"[[working class]]\" accent of the Assyrian dialects. Dialects within Tyare, and especially the Western group, have more in common with [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic]] than with Iraqi Koine (similar to General Urmian). \n\nMany Tyare speakers can switch [[accent reduction|back and forth]] from Tyare to \"Assyrian Standard\" (or \"Iraqi Koine\") when conversing with Assyrian speakers of other dialects. Some speakers tend to adopt a form of verb conjugation that is closer to the Iraqi Koine or Urmian Standard. This is attributed to the growing exposure to Assyrian Standard-based literature, media, and its use as a [[liturgical]] language by the [[Assyrian Church of the East]]. Furthermore, it is customary for [[Assyrian folk/pop music|Assyrian artists]] to generally sing in ''Iraqi Koine'' for them to be intelligible and have widespread recognition. Songs in Tyare dialects are usually of the [[folk music|folk]]-dance music genre and would attract certain audiences.<ref>Solomon, Zomaya S. (1997).

(1994). ''Basic sentence structure in Assyrian Aramaic'', Journal of Assyrian Academic Studies, VIII/1:83-107</ref> The following are [[Periphrasis|periphrastic]] ways to express possession, using the word ''b\u0115t\u0101'' (\"house\") as a base:\n\n*my house: ''b\u0115t\u0101 it d\u0113yi'' (\"house of mine\")\n*your ([[Grammatical gender|masc.]], sing.) house: ''b\u0115t\u0101 it d\u0113y\u016bx'' (\"house of yours\")\n*your (fem., sing.) house: ''b\u0115t\u0101 it d\u0113yax'' \n*your (plural) house: ''b\u0115t\u0101 it d\u0113y\u0115x\u016b'' (\"house of yours\")\n*3rd person (masc., sing.): ''b\u0115t\u0101 it d\u0113yeh'' (\"house of his\")\n*3rd person (fem., sing.): ''b\u0115t\u0101 it d\u0113y\u014d'' (\"house of hers\")\n*3rd person (plural): ''b\u0115t\u0101 it d\u0113y\u0115h\u0115'' (\"house of theirs\")\n\n===Consonants===\nThe Lower Tyare dialect, being [[Conservative (language)|conservative]], generally retains interdental fricative allophones ({{IPAblink|\u03b8}} and {{IPAblink|\u00f0}}) of alveolar stops ([[Voiceless alveolar stop|/t/]] and [[Voiced alveolar stop|/d/]], respectively). This is a feature present in ancient Aramaic (see ''[[begadkefat]]''). Examples:\n* \"Village\": ''m\u0101\u1e6f\u0101'' (like \"math\" said in [[Received Pronunciation]]) in Lower Tyare becomes ''m\u0101t\u0101'' in Iraqi Koine.\n* \"Hand\": ''\u012b\u1e0f\u0101'' in Tyare becomes ''\u012bd\u0101'' in Iraqi Koine.\n\nIn Upper Tyare, {{IPAblink|\u03b8}} is not present in native words. Instead, it becomes a voiceless postalveolar fricative {{IPAblink|\u0283}} after [[front vowel]]s and a voiceless alveolar stop {{IPAblink|t}} everywhere else. Examples:\n*\"Dead\" (masc. singular): ''m\u012b\u1e6f\u0101'' in Lower Tyare, ''m\u012b\u0161\u0101'' in Upper Tyare, and ''m\u012bt\u0101'' in Iraqi Koine.\n*\"Chicken\": ''k\u1e6f\u0113\u1e6f\u0101'' in Lower Tyare, ''kt\u0113\u0161\u0101'' in Upper Tyare, and ''kt\u0113t\u0101'' in Iraqi Koine.\n\nIn some words of foreign origin, [f] may be retained instead of [p]--this is a feature also present in [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic]] and [[Turoyo]]. Furthermore, a {{IPAblink|l}} after a [[stop consonant|voiceless stop]] may be [[assimilation (phonology)|perseveratively assimilated]] by some speakers, namely those with a \"thicker\" accent from [[Ashita]], where, ''letl\u012b'' (\"I don't have\") becomes ''lett\u012b'', and ''priql\u0101h'' (\"it's over\") would become ''priqq\u0101h''.\n\n===Vowels===\n*The [[schwa]] ({{IPA|/\u0259/}}), heard in the Standard Assyrian pronunciations of words like ''x'''\u0259'''\u0161k\u0101'' (\"darkness\"), ''b'''\u0259'''rq\u0101'' (\"lightning\") and ''d'''\u0259'''dw\u0101'' (\"housefly\"), is switched to the [[near-close front unrounded vowel]] {{IPAblink|\u026a}} in the Tyare dialects. This distinct [[vowel shift]] gives the dialect a stronger, \"uneducated\" sound to outside ears.\n* The {{IPAblink|o}} in words like ''t'''\u014d'''r\u0101'' (\"bull\") is [[diphthong]]ized, so it will have an [aw] sound instead (''t'''aw'''r\u0101''). \n* The {{IPAblink|u}} in the standard Assyrian pronunciation, as in ''m'''\u016b'''d\u012b'' (\"what\"), is retained as {{IPAblink|o}} (i.e. ''m'''\u014d'''\u1e0f\u012b'').\n* {{IPA|/a/}}, as commonly uttered in words like ''n'''\u0101'''\u0161\u0101'' (\"man\") and ''n'''\u0101'''r\u0101'' (\"river\") is usually more back {{IPAblink|\u0251}} in the Tyare dialects.<ref>Robinson, Theodore Henry (1915).

Among them are a number of Tyare men, whose wild looks, combined with the splendour of their dress and arms, are of great interest. Their jackets are one mass of gold embroidery, their shirts, with hanging sleeves, are striped satin; their trousers, of sailor cut, are silk, made from the cocoons of their own silkworms, woven with broad crimson stripes on a white ground, on which is a zigzag pattern; and their handsome jackboots are of crimson leather.

They were also famous for their [[textiles]]<ref name=\":0\" />, which again were spun and woven from sheep's wool. They also made woolen felt for their characteristic conical caps<ref>{{Cite book|last=Layard, Austen Henry, 1817-1894.|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/12578949|title=Nineveh and Its Remains|date=1858|publisher=Appleton|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=194|oclc=12578949}}</ref>, and felt was also used for bedding.\n\nThese industries have continued to some extent in their rural settlements in Northern Iraq and North East Syria. One anecdote mentions that, on the flight of Assyrians from Urmia, Iran to Bakuba, Iraq in 1918, the Tyare Assyrians reached the end of the thousand mile trek with more sheep than when they had originally set out.\n\n\n==Dialect==\n[[File:Tyariaccent.ogg|thumb|right|Sample of the Tyare dialect. Notice the usage of [\u03b8], [\u00f0] and [aw], and also the analytic approach regarding [[Possession (linguistics)|possession]] (''otax'd deyeh'', \"bedroom of his\").]]\nLike [[Jilu#Neo-Aramaic dialect of J\u012bl\u016b|J\u012bl\u016b]], the Tyare dialect is a very distinct [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]] dialect. Unlike the ''Jilu'', ''Baz'' and ''Gawar'' dialects (which are very similar to each other), this one is more \"thick\". It is, in a way, a sort of a \"[[working class]]\" accent of the Assyrian dialects. Dialects within Tyare, and especially the Western group, have more in common with [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic]] than with Iraqi Koine (similar to General Urmian). \n\nMany Tyare speakers can switch [[accent reduction|back and forth]] from Tyare to \"Assyrian Standard\" (or \"Iraqi Koine\") when conversing with Assyrian speakers of other dialects. Some speakers tend to adopt a form of verb conjugation that is closer to the Iraqi Koine or Urmian Standard. This is attributed to the growing exposure to Assyrian Standard-based literature, media, and its use as a [[liturgical]] language by the [[Assyrian Church of the East]]. Furthermore, it is customary for [[Assyrian folk/pop music|Assyrian artists]] to generally sing in ''Iraqi Koine'' for them to be intelligible and have widespread recognition. Songs in Tyare dialects are usually of the [[folk music|folk]]-dance music genre and would attract certain audiences.<ref>Solomon, Zomaya S. (1997).

This is a feature present in ancient Aramaic (see ''[[begadkefat]]''). Examples:\n* \"Village\": ''m\u0101\u1e6f\u0101'' (like \"math\" said in [[Received Pronunciation]]) in Lower Tyare becomes ''m\u0101t\u0101'' in Iraqi Koine.\n* \"Hand\": ''\u012b\u1e0f\u0101'' in Tyare becomes ''\u012bd\u0101'' in Iraqi Koine.\n\nIn Upper Tyare, {{IPAblink|\u03b8}} is not present in native words. Instead, it becomes a voiceless postalveolar fricative {{IPAblink|\u0283}} after [[front vowel]]s and a voiceless alveolar stop {{IPAblink|t}} everywhere else.

[[James E. West (Scouting)|James E. West]] felt that having BSA divisions for younger boys (those under 12; the \"younger boy problem\") would draw away boys from the core program, which was Scout troops focused on the 12- to 17-year-old age group; thus he opposed such a program for some time. In spite of this, unofficial programs for younger boys started around this time, under names such as ''Junior Troops'' or ''Cadet Corps''. The BSA obtained the rights to Lord Baden-Powell's ''The Wolf Cub Handbook'' in 1916 and used it in unofficial Wolf Cub programs starting in 1918. This led to an issue with [[Daniel Carter Beard]] who felt that the use of the British book was nearly disloyal to the United States of America.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} West encouraged the formation of the [[Boy Rangers of America]], a separate organization for boys eight through twelve based on an [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] theme. The Boy Rangers used the Scout Law and their Chief Guide, [[Emerson Brooks]], was a Boy Scout commissioner in [[Montclair, New Jersey]]. The BSA finally began some experimental Cub units in 1928 and in 1930 the BSA began registering the first Cub Scout packs, and the Boy Rangers were absorbed.<ref name=\"threefires\">{{cite web|url=http://www.threefirescouncil.org/History/ |title=A Brief History of the Boy Scouts of America |publisher=Three Fires Council |accessdate=July 27, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927023056/http://www.threefirescouncil.org/History/ |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe British Cubbing program used elements of [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s [[The Jungle Book|''Jungle Book'' series]], with the Cubmaster taking the role of [[Akela (Scouting)|Akela]] and the assistant Cubmaster the role of [[Baloo]].

Wells Cubs.png|thumb|left|A meeting of the Cub Scouts at the Ida B. Wells Housing Project, Chicago]]\nThe Cub Scout pack is sponsored by a community organization such as a business, service organization, school, labor group or religious institution. The chartered organization is responsible for selecting leadership, providing a meeting place and promoting a good program. The chartered organization representative is the liaison between the pack, the chartered organization, and the BSA.\n\nThe pack meets once a month, providing a program for Cub Scouts, leaders, parents and other family members attending. The pack is led by a Cubmaster with one or more assistant Cubmasters. The pack committee is a group of adults, led by the pack committee chair, who plan the pack program and activities and manage record keeping, finance, leadership recruitment and registration. The pack trainer is responsible for ensuring that all of the pack leaders are trained and for maintaining training records.\n\nCub Scouts who join a pack are assigned to dens with ideally six to eight members, usually based on age: Lion Scouts (kindergarten), Tiger Scouts (first grade), Wolf Scouts (second grade), Bear Scouts (third grade), and Webelos Scouts (fourth and fifth grades). Dens meet weekly or biweekly under the direction of the adult den leader. A Cub Scout is elected to the denner position to provide basic leadership to the den. A Scout or Venturer holding the den chief position may assist the den leader in activities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scouting.org/CubScouts/AboutCubScouts/ThePack/csdcf.aspx |title=Cub Scout Den Chief |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=March 17, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503184015/http://www.scouting.org/CubScouts/AboutCubScouts/ThePack/csdcf.aspx |archive-date=May 3, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Den meetings are planned around a particular adventure being worked on for rank advancement and may include games, handicrafts, hikes and other outdoor fun while also preparing for the next pack meeting.\n\nWebelos is an acronym meaning \"We'll Be Loyal Scouts\".

Starting in 2017, fifth graders work on the formalized rank of Arrow of Light, so this I and II distinction may no longer be necessary. Webelos dens spend much of their time learning about Scout customs, including the [[Scout Law]] and [[Scout Oath|Oath]].

These are generally recognized by a medal and an embroidered square knot that can also be worn on the Scouting uniform.\n\n===Leader recognition===\nCub Scout leaders who complete training, tenure, and performance requirements are recognized by a system of awards. The Den Leader Award, the [[Scouter's Training Award]], and the [[Scouter's Key Award|Cubmaster's Training Key]] are available.  These awards were standardized to more closely align with the BSA's other programs in 2012, removing most of the distinctive Cub Scout level awards such as Tiger Cub Den Leader's Training Award (discontinued December 2012), the Webelos Den Leader's Training Award (discontinued December 2012), the Cubmaster's Training Award (discontinued December 2013), the Cub Scouter's Training Award (discontinued December 2013), and the Pack Trainer Award (discontinued December 2013).  The Scouter's Training Award replaced the Cub Scouter Award, and the Cubmaster's Training Key replaced the Cubmaster's Training Award.  The Pack Trainer Award had previously replaced the Den Leader Coach Award, which was officially discontinued on December 31, 2008.  Any awards earned prior to the date of their retirement can still be worn. These awards are recognized by a certificate, medal, and an embroidered square knot insignia.{{ref label|Lead_Award|C|none}} Den Chiefs may earn the Den Chief Service Award.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/BoyScouts/AdvancementandAwards/MeritBadges/dencf.aspx |title=Den Chief Service Award |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=September 30, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Program and activities==\nEach pack has a number of annual events such as the [[pinewood derby]], [[raingutter regatta]], the [[space derby]], gold rush, the blue and gold banquet and [[Scouts' Day|Scout Sunday or Scout Sabbath]].\n\nSeveral structured [[camping]] activities are available in the Cub Scout program. The pack overnighter is a pack-organized camping activity that provides Cub Scouts with positive outdoor experiences. Cub Scout day camp or twilight camp is an accredited, organized, one- to five-day program for Cub Scouts using trained leadership at an approved site, and is usually held during daylight or early evening hours, but not overnight. Cub Scout resident camp is an organized, accredited overnight camping program covering at least two nights and conducted under trained leadership in an established Scout camp operated by the council. The Webelos den overnight camp introduces the Scout and parents to the camping program, under the leadership of the Webelos den leader. Joint campouts with a local Scout troop for second-year Webelos can help to strengthen ties between the pack and troop and facilitate the transition from Webelos to Scouts.\n\nThe Soccer and Scouting<ref>{{cite web |url=http://soccerandscouting.org/ |title=Soccer and Scouting}}</ref> program is designed to involve Hispanic youth and families in the Cub Scout program, instructing Scouts in both soccer and Cub Scout values.\n\nAlcohol is prohibited at all Cub Scout events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/HealthandSafety/GSS/gss04.aspx |title=Alcohol, Tobacco, and Drug Use and Abuse |publisher=Scouting.org |date= |accessdate=December 16, 2011}}</ref> A number of \"high-risk\" outdoor activities are banned by BSA (including Cubs), and others are limited to special programs.

Basic Leader Training consists of the online This is Scouting course and Leader Specific Training. This is Scouting is a common core program for all adult leaders in the Cub Scouting, Scouts BSA, Varsity Scouting, and Venturing divisions. Leader Specific Training is provided for the Tiger Cub den leader, Cub Scout den leader, Webelos den leader, Cubmaster, pack committee chairman and assistants. Once Basic Leader Training is completed, the leader is awarded a Trained emblem for uniform wear.\n\nAt least one adult on a pack overnight campout must attend the Basic Adult Leader Outdoor Orientation (BALOO) in order to properly understand camping requirements.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scouting.org/HealthandSafety/GSS/gss03.aspx |title=Camping |work=Guide to Safe Scouting |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=December 27, 2006}}</ref> Leaders for day camp and resident camp programs must be trained and certified by the National Camping School.\n\nSupplemental training modules are designed to provide orientation beyond Basic Leader Training. These shorter training sessions are often provided at the Roundtable, a monthly meeting of leaders from the district, at a Pow-Wow or University of Scouting program offered by the local council and at National Cub Scouting Conferences held at the [[Philmont Scout Ranch]] and the [[Florida National High Adventure Sea Base]].\n\n[[Wood Badge (Boy Scouts of America)|Wood Badge]] is the advanced training program for leadership skills for all adults in all BSA programs. Wood Badge consists of six days of training (usually presented as two three-day weekends) and an application phase of several months. When training is complete, leaders are recognized with the Wood Badge beads, neckerchief and [[woggle]].\n\nTraining is also provided for all new den chiefs.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n:A{{Note label|WebEl||1}}{{Note label|WebEl||2}}The Webelos badge and Arrow of Light use the same pool of eighteen elective adventures.

[[James E. West (Scouting)|James E. West]] felt that having BSA divisions for younger boys (those under 12; the \"younger boy problem\") would draw away boys from the core program, which was Scout troops focused on the 12- to 17-year-old age group; thus he opposed such a program for some time. In spite of this, unofficial programs for younger boys started around this time, under names such as ''Junior Troops'' or ''Cadet Corps''. The BSA obtained the rights to Lord Baden-Powell's ''The Wolf Cub Handbook'' in 1916 and used it in unofficial Wolf Cub programs starting in 1918. This led to an issue with [[Daniel Carter Beard]] who felt that the use of the British book was nearly disloyal to the United States of America.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} West encouraged the formation of the [[Boy Rangers of America]], a separate organization for boys eight through twelve based on an [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] theme. The Boy Rangers used the Scout Law and their Chief Guide, [[Emerson Brooks]], was a Boy Scout commissioner in [[Montclair, New Jersey]]. The BSA finally began some experimental Cub units in 1928 and in 1930 the BSA began registering the first Cub Scout packs, and the Boy Rangers were absorbed.<ref name=\"threefires\">{{cite web|url=http://www.threefirescouncil.org/History/ |title=A Brief History of the Boy Scouts of America |publisher=Three Fires Council |accessdate=July 27, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927023056/http://www.threefirescouncil.org/History/ |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe British Cubbing program used elements of [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s [[The Jungle Book|''Jungle Book'' series]], with the Cubmaster taking the role of [[Akela (Scouting)|Akela]] and the assistant Cubmaster the role of [[Baloo]].

Wells Cubs.png|thumb|left|A meeting of the Cub Scouts at the Ida B. Wells Housing Project, Chicago]]\nThe Cub Scout pack is sponsored by a community organization such as a business, service organization, school, labor group or religious institution. The chartered organization is responsible for selecting leadership, providing a meeting place and promoting a good program. The chartered organization representative is the liaison between the pack, the chartered organization, and the BSA.\n\nThe pack meets once a month, providing a program for Cub Scouts, leaders, parents and other family members attending. The pack is led by a Cubmaster with one or more assistant Cubmasters. The pack committee is a group of adults, led by the pack committee chair, who plan the pack program and activities and manage record keeping, finance, leadership recruitment and registration. The pack trainer is responsible for ensuring that all of the pack leaders are trained and for maintaining training records.\n\nCub Scouts who join a pack are assigned to dens with ideally six to eight members, usually based on age: Lion Scouts (kindergarten), Tiger Scouts (first grade), Wolf Scouts (second grade), Bear Scouts (third grade), and Webelos Scouts (fourth and fifth grades). Dens meet weekly or biweekly under the direction of the adult den leader. A Cub Scout is elected to the denner position to provide basic leadership to the den. A Scout or Venturer holding the den chief position may assist the den leader in activities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scouting.org/CubScouts/AboutCubScouts/ThePack/csdcf.aspx |title=Cub Scout Den Chief |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=March 17, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503184015/http://www.scouting.org/CubScouts/AboutCubScouts/ThePack/csdcf.aspx |archive-date=May 3, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Den meetings are planned around a particular adventure being worked on for rank advancement and may include games, handicrafts, hikes and other outdoor fun while also preparing for the next pack meeting.\n\nWebelos is an acronym meaning \"We'll Be Loyal Scouts\". According to the ''Bear Cub Scout Book'' of 1954, the name originally came from the initial letters of \"wolf, bear, lion, Scout\", the rank of \"Lion Cub Scout\" was dropped in 1967<ref>''Scouting'', March\u2013April 1997 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nf0DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA4&dq=webelo+scout+%22wolf%22+bear+lion&hl=en&sa=X&ei=fXSNUN_-C9S80QHW6IGYAg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=webelo%20scout%20%22wolf%22%20bear%20lion&f=false Letters - ''Webelos once had a different meaning''] (p.4)</ref>, however was used again in 2017 with the launch of the pilot kindergarten program of the same name which became a full-fledged part of the program in 2018. Packs with a large number of Webelos Scouts sometimes divide them into Webelos I and Webelos II dens, to keep their den from previous years intact. Starting in 2017, fifth graders work on the formalized rank of Arrow of Light, so this I and II distinction may no longer be necessary. Webelos dens spend much of their time learning about Scout customs, including the [[Scout Law]] and [[Scout Oath|Oath]]. Many packs are formally associated with a Scout troop for mutual support\u2014the troop provides assistance to the pack with activities such as campouts and ceremonies and in time, the Webelos Scouts cross over to the troop.\n\nThe Lone Cub Scout program serves youth who cannot take part in a nearby Cub Scout pack on a regular basis because of such factors as distance, weather, time, disability or similar issues.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scouting.org/Media/FactSheets/02-515.aspx |title=BSA Fact Sheet: What Is the Lone Scout Plan? |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=February 7, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313113805/http://www.scouting.org/Media/FactSheets/02-515.aspx |archive-date=March 13, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn October 2017, The Boy Scouts of America announced that girls would be welcomed into the Cub Scout program in single gender dens but co-ed packs. 77,000 girls joined nationwide creating packs in California, among other places.<ref>{{Cite news | url = https://piedmontexedra.com/2019/02/new-era-begins-for-piedmont-boy-scouts-as-girls-join-the-ranks | title = New era begins for Piedmont Boy Scouts as girls join the ranks | work = Piedmont Exedra | first1 = Sam | last1 = Richards | date = February 19, 2019 | access-date = May 10, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | url = https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/01/us/boy-scouts-girls-trnd/index.html | title = Girls can join the Boy Scouts now -- but not everyone is happy about it | date = February 1, 2019 | first1 = Dakin | last1 = Andone | work = [[CNN]] | access-date = May 10, 2019 | publisher = [[Turner Broadcasting System]]}}</ref>\n\n==Uniform==\nThe [[uniform]] gives a Cub Scout visibility and creates a level of identity within both the unit and the community. The neckerchief, the neckerchief slide and the belt buckle uniforms are similar in basic design, they do vary in color and detail to identify the different divisions of Cub Scouts, Scouts and Venturers. In all cases, shirts are tucked in.\n\n===Youth uniforms===\n[[File:US Navy 081004-N-5345W-021 Cub Scouts prepare to parade the colors.jpg|thumb|250px|Wolf Cubs in [[Virginia]] (red color being phased in for hat and neckerchief)]]\nLions wear a unique uniform consisting of a blue t-shirt with lion logo on front, blue web belt, blue cap with lion logo, and optional yellow neckerchief and slide.\n\nTigers wear the [[Uniform and insignia of the Boy Scouts of America#Cub Scout uniform|Cub Scout uniform]]; it is accompanied by orange topped socks, orange neckerchief, neckerchief slide with the Tiger logo, the cap with an orange panel and Tiger emblem and the blue belt with Tiger emblem on the buckle.\n\nWolves wear the Cub Scout uniform and the Wolf cap with yellow or red panel and Wolf logo and the yellow or red neckerchief and the neckerchief slide with Wolf logo.

The Webelos cap is green with a plaid panel and the oval Webelos emblem; the plaid is made up of the Cub Scouting blue and gold and the Scouts BSA red and green. The neckerchief is plaid with the Webelos logo and is worn with the slide with Webelos emblem. Webelos wearing the Scout uniform may choose to use the Webelos belt buckle with either the blue Cub Scout or the green Scout belt; Cub Scout belt loop recognitions, however, fit only the blue belt. The Webelos den may elect to wear a den emblem in place of the den number; the patches are the same as the Scout patrol patches.<ref>{{cite web | title = Cub Scout Uniform | publisher = Boy Scouts of America | year = 2018 | url = https://www.scouting.org/programs/cub-scouts/cub-scout-uniform/ | accessdate = November 22, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Scouter uniforms===\nAdult leaders wear the basic Scout field uniform. Female leaders of dens below Webelos level have the option of the classic [[Uniform and insignia of the Boy Scouts of America#Cub Scouter uniform for females|female Cub Scouter uniform]] with blue web belt. Leaders that wear the tan uniform shirt wear blue shoulder loops on the epaulets, Centennial or Switchbacks pants or shorts, and the Scout web or leather belt. If a neckerchief is worn, male leaders wear the Cub Scout leader neckerchief (if he is a Tiger Cub leader or Cub Scout den leader or assistant den leader), Webelos leader neckerchief (if he is a Webelos den leader or assistant den leader), International adult neckerchief, [[National Eagle Scout Association]] neckerchief (if he earned the [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] rank as a youth), [[Wood Badge (Boy Scouts of America)|Wood Badge]] neckerchief, or Wood Badge Tartan neckerchief (if he has completed Wood Badge training), with the appropriate neckerchief slide or woggle. Pack leaders wear the olive visor cap. Den leaders wear the same visored cap as the youth they serve, if the den chooses to wear a cap.\n\nThe [[Uniform and insignia of the Boy Scouts of America#Scouter dress uniform|Scouter dress uniform]] is appropriate for professional Scouters and all Scouting leaders on formal occasions.\n\n==Advancement and recognition==\n{{quote box|qalign=center|<poem>\n[[File:Cub Scout ranks (Boy Scouts of America) 2018.jpg|150px]]\nLion, Bobcat, Tiger, Wolf, Bear Scout Badges\n\n[[File:Webelos Badge.gif|100px]]\nWebelos Scout Badge\n\n[[File:Webelos Colors and Pins 2018.jpg|70px]]\nWebelos Scout Colors and Adventure Pins\n\n[[File:Arrow of Light.png|70px]]\nArrow of Light\nemblem (youth)\nand knot (adult)\n</poem>}}\nAdvancement is one of the methods used to promote the aims of character development, [[citizenship]] training, personal fitness, and leadership. Everything a Cub Scout does in the advancement program is intended to achieve these aims and aid in personal growth. On June 1, 2015, Cub Scouting changed the advancement system to an \"adventure\" system, including required and elective adventures for all ranks. Lion, Tiger, Wolf, and Bear Cubs earn activity belt loops for each completed adventure, while Webelos earn activity pins which can be worn on the cap or on the Webelos colors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://usscouts.org/usscouts/advance/cubscout/intro.asp |title=Cub Scout Advancement |publisher=U.S. Scouting Service Project |date=August 11, 2015 |accessdate=February 17, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.scoutingmagazine.org/2015/08/27/boys-earn-adventure-loops-pins-new-cub-scout-program/ |title=How boys earn adventure loops and pins in new Cub Scout program |publisher=Scouting Magazine |author=Bryan Wendell |date=August 27, 2015 |accessdate=February 17, 2016}}</ref>\n===Lion badge===\nKindergartners work toward the Lion badge. The Lion badge is earned by completing five adventures. Outside of the requirements, Lion Scouts can also complete any number of seven elective adventures of their den\u2019s or family\u2019s choosing. Lions do not earn the Bobcat badge.

To earn the Arrow of Light, the Cub Scout must complete four required adventures, three of eighteen elective adventures,{{ref label|WebEl|A|2}} and the Cyber Chip and child abuse prevention exercises. The Cyber Chip exercises can be waived if the family does not have easy access to the internet.<ref name=\" W2AOL\" /> Earning the Arrow of Light allows a youth to join a Scout troop prior at ten years of age instead of eleven.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://filestore.scouting.org/filestore/pdf/524-406.pdf | title= Youth Application #524-406 | publisher = Boy Scouts of America| accessdate = February 11, 2019}}</ref>  The requirements for the Arrow of Light overlap significantly with the requirements for the first rank in Scouts BSA, the Scout rank.  Recipients of the Arrow of Light thus have an advantage in earning the Scout rank soon after joining a Scout troop. The Arrow of Light award is one of the few Cub Scout awards that can be worn on a Scout uniform.{{ref label|Award|B|none}} Both Cub Scouts and Scouts wear the Arrow of Light badge below the left pocket. Adults wear the square-knot version of the badge above the left pocket.\n\n===Religious emblems===\nSeveral [[religious emblems programs (Boy Scouts of America)|religious emblems programs]] are administered by various religious institutions and recognized, but not sponsored, by the BSA. These are generally recognized by a medal and an embroidered square knot that can also be worn on the Scouting uniform.\n\n===Leader recognition===\nCub Scout leaders who complete training, tenure, and performance requirements are recognized by a system of awards. The Den Leader Award, the [[Scouter's Training Award]], and the [[Scouter's Key Award|Cubmaster's Training Key]] are available.  These awards were standardized to more closely align with the BSA's other programs in 2012, removing most of the distinctive Cub Scout level awards such as Tiger Cub Den Leader's Training Award (discontinued December 2012), the Webelos Den Leader's Training Award (discontinued December 2012), the Cubmaster's Training Award (discontinued December 2013), the Cub Scouter's Training Award (discontinued December 2013), and the Pack Trainer Award (discontinued December 2013).  The Scouter's Training Award replaced the Cub Scouter Award, and the Cubmaster's Training Key replaced the Cubmaster's Training Award.  The Pack Trainer Award had previously replaced the Den Leader Coach Award, which was officially discontinued on December 31, 2008.  Any awards earned prior to the date of their retirement can still be worn. These awards are recognized by a certificate, medal, and an embroidered square knot insignia.{{ref label|Lead_Award|C|none}} Den Chiefs may earn the Den Chief Service Award.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/BoyScouts/AdvancementandAwards/MeritBadges/dencf.aspx |title=Den Chief Service Award |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=September 30, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Program and activities==\nEach pack has a number of annual events such as the [[pinewood derby]], [[raingutter regatta]], the [[space derby]], gold rush, the blue and gold banquet and [[Scouts' Day|Scout Sunday or Scout Sabbath]].\n\nSeveral structured [[camping]] activities are available in the Cub Scout program. The pack overnighter is a pack-organized camping activity that provides Cub Scouts with positive outdoor experiences. Cub Scout day camp or twilight camp is an accredited, organized, one- to five-day program for Cub Scouts using trained leadership at an approved site, and is usually held during daylight or early evening hours, but not overnight. Cub Scout resident camp is an organized, accredited overnight camping program covering at least two nights and conducted under trained leadership in an established Scout camp operated by the council. The Webelos den overnight camp introduces the Scout and parents to the camping program, under the leadership of the Webelos den leader. Joint campouts with a local Scout troop for second-year Webelos can help to strengthen ties between the pack and troop and facilitate the transition from Webelos to Scouts.\n\nThe Soccer and Scouting<ref>{{cite web |url=http://soccerandscouting.org/ |title=Soccer and Scouting}}</ref> program is designed to involve Hispanic youth and families in the Cub Scout program, instructing Scouts in both soccer and Cub Scout values.\n\nAlcohol is prohibited at all Cub Scout events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/HealthandSafety/GSS/gss04.aspx |title=Alcohol, Tobacco, and Drug Use and Abuse |publisher=Scouting.org |date= |accessdate=December 16, 2011}}</ref> A number of \"high-risk\" outdoor activities are banned by BSA (including Cubs), and others are limited to special programs. Paintball, lasertag, hunting, rodeo, fireworks, and bungee-jumping are among prohibited activities.<ref>[http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/HealthandSafety/GSS/gss08.aspx#e Sports and Activities], Boy Scouts of America</ref>\n\n==Training==\nFast Start Training is the introduction for adult leaders new to the Cub Scout program.

Basic Leader Training consists of the online This is Scouting course and Leader Specific Training. This is Scouting is a common core program for all adult leaders in the Cub Scouting, Scouts BSA, Varsity Scouting, and Venturing divisions. Leader Specific Training is provided for the Tiger Cub den leader, Cub Scout den leader, Webelos den leader, Cubmaster, pack committee chairman and assistants. Once Basic Leader Training is completed, the leader is awarded a Trained emblem for uniform wear.\n\nAt least one adult on a pack overnight campout must attend the Basic Adult Leader Outdoor Orientation (BALOO) in order to properly understand camping requirements.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scouting.org/HealthandSafety/GSS/gss03.aspx |title=Camping |work=Guide to Safe Scouting |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=December 27, 2006}}</ref> Leaders for day camp and resident camp programs must be trained and certified by the National Camping School.\n\nSupplemental training modules are designed to provide orientation beyond Basic Leader Training. These shorter training sessions are often provided at the Roundtable, a monthly meeting of leaders from the district, at a Pow-Wow or University of Scouting program offered by the local council and at National Cub Scouting Conferences held at the [[Philmont Scout Ranch]] and the [[Florida National High Adventure Sea Base]].\n\n[[Wood Badge (Boy Scouts of America)|Wood Badge]] is the advanced training program for leadership skills for all adults in all BSA programs. Wood Badge consists of six days of training (usually presented as two three-day weekends) and an application phase of several months. When training is complete, leaders are recognized with the Wood Badge beads, neckerchief and [[woggle]].\n\nTraining is also provided for all new den chiefs.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n:A{{Note label|WebEl||1}}{{Note label|WebEl||2}}The Webelos badge and Arrow of Light use the same pool of eighteen elective adventures.
