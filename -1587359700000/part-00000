Video game genres are not usually defined by the [[Setting (narrative)|setting]] or [[Narrative|story]] of the game or its medium of play, but by the way the player interacts with the game.<ref name=\"adams2013-c3s1\">{{harvnb|Adams|2013|loc=ch. 3 \u00a7 1}}.</ref> For example; a [[first-person shooter]] is still a first-person shooter regardless of whether it takes place in a [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]], or [[Military fiction|military]] setting; so long as it features a camera mimicking the perspective of the protagonist ([[First-person (gaming)|first-person]]) and gameplay centered around the use of [[ranged weapon]]ry.\n\nGenres may encompass a wide variety of games, leading to even more specific classifications called ''subgenres''. For example, an [[action game]] can be classified into many subgenres such as [[platform game]]s and [[fighting game]]s. Some games, most notably [[browser game|browser]] and [[mobile game|mobile]] games, are commonly classified into multiple genres.<ref name=\"adams2013-c3s1\" /><ref name=\"adams2013-c3s2\">{{harvnb|Adams|2013|loc=ch. 3 \u00a7 2}}.</ref>\n\nThe following is a list of all commonly defined video game genres, with short descriptions for individual genres and major subgenres.\n\n== Action ==\n{{Main|Action game}}Action games emphasize physical challenges that require [[Hand-eye coordination|hand-eye coordination]] and [[motor skill]] to overcome. They center around the player, who is in control of most of the action. Most of the earliest video games were considered action games; today, it is still a vast genre covering all games that involve physical challenges.\n\nAction games are classified by many subgenres. [[Platform games]] and [[fighting games]] are among the best-known subgenres, while [[shooter games]] became and continue to be one of the dominant genres in video gaming since the 1990s.<ref name=\"adams2014\">{{harvnb|Adams|2014}}.</ref>{{sfn|Wolf|2012|p=572}} Action games usually involve elements of [[twitch gameplay]].<ref name=\"adams2014\" />\n\n=== Platform games ===\n{{Main|Platform game}}\n[[File:FEZ trial gameplay HD.webm|thumb|Platform games feature vertical environments with leaping and climbing between platforms, hence the name ''platform game''.|205x205px]]\nPlatform games (or ''platformers'') have gameplay primarily centered around jumping and climbing to navigate the character's environment. They may have enemies or obstacles to avoid and fight or may just be pure jumping puzzles. Generally the player's character in a platform game is able to jump many times their own height and player is offered some control over their movement in midair as well as the height and distance of their jumps.<ref name=\"adams2013-c3s2\" /> Settings tend to be vertically exaggerated with lots of uneven terrain that the player can leap to or fall off of.\n\n''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'' was one of the earliest and best-known platformers; the American gaming press classified it using the term ''climbing game'' at the time.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Player's Guide to Climbing Games|journal=Electronic Games|date=January 1983|volume=1|issue=11|page=49|url=https://archive.org/stream/Electronic_Games_Volume_01_Number_11_1983-01_Reese_Communications_US#page/n47/mode/2up|access-date=December 12, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319134356/https://archive.org/stream/Electronic_Games_Volume_01_Number_11_1983-01_Reese_Communications_US#page/n47/mode/2up|archive-date=March 19, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' was one of the best-selling games of all time, with more than 40 million copies sold.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamecubicle.com/features-mario-units_sold_sales.htm |title=Mario Sales Data |access-date=December 12, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/65RQRdS8T?url=http://www.gamecubicle.com/features-mario-units_sold_sales.htm |archive-date=February 14, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== Shooter games ===\n{{main|Shooter game}}\n[[File:Freedoom 0.9 MAP07.png|thumb|This picture shows gameplay of a freely licensed version of ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', a highly influential first-person shooter.|205x205px]]\nIn shooter games (or simply ''shooters''), players use ranged weapons to participate in the action, which takes place at a distance.<ref name=\"adams2013-c3s2\" /> Most shooters involve violent gameplay; lethal weaponry is used to damage opponents. However, some shooters, such as ''[[Splatoon]]'', have non-violent objectives.\n\nShooters, aside from subgenre classifications, can be further classified by their perspective of play. [[First-person shooter]]s are played within the [[protagonist]]'s perspective; they often include a heads-up display displaying key information such as the current [[Health (gaming)|health]] of the protagonist.{{sfn|Call|Whitlock|Voorhees|2012|p=5}}<ref name=\"adams2015p39\">{{harvnb|Adams|2015|p=39}}.</ref> In [[third-person shooter]]s, the protagonist's body can be seen fully; the environment is rendered from a distance.<ref name=\"adams2015p39\" /> Some shooters incorporate both perspectives.<ref name=\"adams2013-c3s2\" />\n\n[[Hero shooter]]s are either first- or third-person multiplayer shooters that strongly encourage [[Cooperative gameplay|cooperative play]] between players on a single team through the use of pre-designed hero characters that each possess unique attributes, skills, weapons, and other passive and active abilities. While setting up a match, players on a team typically must each select a hero who is different from those selected by teammates and, as the match progresses, the players gain experience to unlock more powerful abilities for their hero. Outside of a match, players have the ability to customize the appearance of the heroes but with no other in-game effects. Hero shooters are inspired by the [[multiplayer online battle arena]] genre, and popular team-based shooters like ''[[Team Fortress 2]]''. Examples of hero shooters include ''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]'', ''[[Paladins (video game)|Paladins]]'', and ''[[Apex Legends]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/271933/Hero_Shooters_Charting_the_rebirth_of_a_genre.php|title=Hero Shooters: Charting the (re)birth of a genre|last=Wawro|first=Alex|date=May 6, 2016|work=[[Gamasutra]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507142751/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/271933/Hero_Shooters_Charting_the_rebirth_of_a_genre.php|archive-date=May 7, 2016|accessdate=May 6, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thegamer.com/overwatch-2-hero-shooter/|title=Overwatch 2 And The Future Of The Hero Shooter|date=2019-07-26|website=TheGamer|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref>\n\n[[Light gun shooter]]s are controlled with a gun-shaped controller; light guns function via a light sensor, hence the name \"light gun\".

Most fighting games feature a large number of playable characters and a competitive multiplayer mode. While most fighting games emphasize hand-to-hand combat,<ref name=\"adams2013-c3s2\" /> some fighting games such as ''[[Soulcalibur]]'' and ''[[Samurai Shodown]]'' center around combat with melee weapons. Many fighting games incorporate heavily emphasized attacks based on various [[martial arts]] systems. Fighting games were one of the dominant genres in video gaming until the late-1990s, where the genre saw a slight decline. This decline was short lived however, for titles such as ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'', ''[[Street Fighter]]'', and ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' dominate the fighter demographic of the modern era.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dunn|first1=Jeff|title=Of Fists and Fatalities: The history of fighting games|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/fists-and-fatalities-history-fighting-games/|website=Gamesradar|accessdate=November 14, 2015|date=2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222211857/http://www.gamesradar.com/fists-and-fatalities-history-fighting-games/|archive-date=December 22, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Different sub-genre games are starting to become more popular though. ''Super Smash Bros.'', and its deviation from the traditional fighting game rule set is on of these games that has gained a large following because of its \"fun over form\" party game development mentality.\n\n=== Beat 'em up games ===\n{{Main|Beat 'em up}}\n[[Beat 'em ups]] (or ''brawlers'') are a related, but distinct genre to fighting games. While they both involve close-range combat, beat 'em ups put players against large waves of opponents as opposed to a few.<ref name=\"adams2013-c3s2\" /><ref name=\"rogers2014\" /> Beat 'em ups often incorporate mechanics from other action genres and multiplayer in beat 'em up games tends to be [[Cooperative gameplay|co-operative]] rather than competitive. Beat 'em ups saw a sudden decline in popularity in the early 1990s with the release of fighting games, but 3D beat 'em ups have kept the genre alive.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Spencer|first1=Spanner|title=The Tao of Beat-'em-ups \u2022 Page 3|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/a_taoofbeatemups_pt2_retro?page=3|website=Eurogamer|accessdate=November 14, 2015|date=2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925150533/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/a_taoofbeatemups_pt2_retro?page=3|archive-date=September 25, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Hack and Slash]] is a sub-genre often used to refer to weapons based beat 'em ups.\n\n=== Stealth game ===\n{{main|Stealth game}}\nThese games tend to emphasize sneaking around and avoiding enemy notice over direct conflict, for example, the ''[[Metal Gear]]'' series, and the ''[[Sly Cooper]]'' series. In a Stealth game, players are usually still able to engage in loud, conspicuous combat, but are often punished for it. Other games, such as ''[[Dishonored]]'', the player can obtain their goal with or without stealth, but stealth is encouraged as the player is at a disadvantage over many of their enemies. The inclusion of stealth as a mechanic in a game does not necessarily make it a Stealth Game. For example, ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim|Skyrim]]'' has an entire perk tree dedicated to \"Sneaking\", but there are few opportunities to use it effectively until the player invests dozens of perks into it, and most of the dungeons in the game are set up in favor of the hack-and-slash strategy that most players adopt.{{original research inline|date=October 2017}}\n\nThe first stealth game was ''Manbiki Shounen'' (''Shoplifting Boy''), published in November 1979.<ref>{{cite book |last=Szczepaniak |first=John |year=2014 |title=The Untold History of Japanese Game Developers |publisher=SMG Szczepaniak |volume=1 |page=7 |isbn=978-0-9929260-3-8 |quote=First ever stealth game, ''Manbiki Shounen''}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/japandvd/japandvd.htm|title=The Untold History of Japanese Game Developers BOOK|website=Hardcore Gaming 101|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160908102842/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/japandvd/japandvd.htm|archivedate=2016-09-08}}</ref> The [[PET 2001]] [[personal computer game]] was developed by Hiroshi Suzuki.<ref>{{cite book |last=Szczepaniak |first=John |year=2014 |title=The Untold History of Japanese Game Developers |publisher=SMG Szczepaniak |volume=1 |pages=604\u2013605 |isbn=978-0-9929260-3-8 |quote=SUZUKI, Hiroshi ...

Many are set in procedurally-generated environments, and are open-ended with no set goals. They may overlap with the [[survival horror]] genre, in which the player must survive within a supernatural setting, such as a zombie apocalypse.\n\n=== Battle Royale ===\n{{main|Battle royale game}}\nA battle royale game is a genre that blends the survival, exploration and scavenging elements of a [[survival game]] with [[Last man standing (gaming)|last man standing]] gameplay. Battle royale games challenge a large number of players, starting with minimal equipment, to search for weapons and armor and eliminate other opponents, while trying to stay in safe playable area which shrinks as the time passes, with the winner being the last competitor in the game. Notable battle royale games include ''[[PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds]]'', ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'', and ''[[Apex Legends]]''.\n\n=== Rhythm games ===\n{{main|Rhythm game}}\n[[File:Fretsonfire4.png|thumb|230x230px|''[[Frets on Fire]]'' is a music game.|alt=]]\n'''Rhythm game'''&nbsp;or&nbsp;'''rhythm action'''&nbsp;is a&nbsp;genre&nbsp;of&nbsp;[[Music video game|music-themed]]&nbsp;[[Action game|action video game]]&nbsp;that challenges a player's sense of rhythm.&nbsp;The genre includes dance games such as&nbsp;''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]''&nbsp;and music-based games such as&nbsp;''[[Donkey Konga]]''&nbsp;and&nbsp;''[[Guitar Hero]]''. Games in the genre challenge the player to press buttons at precise times: the screen shows which button the player is required to press, and the game awards points both for accuracy and for synchronization with the beat.\n\n''[[PaRappa the Rapper]]''&nbsp;has been deemed the first influential rhythm game; whose basic template formed the core of subsequent games in the genre. Other popular rhythm games include ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]'', [[Maimai (video game)|''Maimai'']], [[Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA|''Project Diva'']], ''[[Cytus]]'', [[Love Live! School Idol Festival|''Love Live: School Idol Festival'']], ''[[The Idolmaster]]'', ''[[osu!]]'', ''[[Taiko no Tatsujin]]'', ''[[Crypt of the Necrodancer]]'', ''[[Rhythm Heaven]]'', etc.\n\n== Action-adventure ==\n{{main|Action-adventure game}}\n\n[[Action-adventure game]]s combine elements of their two component genres, typically featuring long-term obstacles that must be overcome using a tool or item as leverage (which is collected earlier), as well as many smaller obstacles almost constantly in the way, that require elements of action games to overcome. Action-adventure games tend to focus on exploration and usually involve item gathering, simple puzzle solving, and combat. \"Action-adventure\" has become a label which is sometimes attached to games which do not fit neatly into another well known genre. Because of their prevalence on [[video game console]]s and the absence of typical [[adventure game]]s, action-adventure games are often called \"adventure games\" by modern gamers.\n\nOne of the first action-adventure games was the [[Atari 2600]] game ''[[Adventure (Atari 2600)|Adventure]]'' (1980). It was directly inspired by the original [[text adventure]], ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure]]''. In the process of adapting a text game to a console with only a joystick for control, designer [[Warren Robinett]] created an action-adventure game by incorporating action [[arcade game]] elements.\n\nThe action-adventure later became an established genre with [[Shigeru Miyamoto]]'s ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' (1986), which became a success due to how it combined elements from different genres to create a compelling hybrid, including exploration, [[transport puzzle]]s, adventure-style inventory [[Puzzle game|puzzles]], an action component, a monetary system, and simplified RPG-style level building without the [[experience points]].<ref>{{Cite web |author=Travis Fahs |url=http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/939/939361p1.html |title=IGN Presents the History of Zelda - Retro Feature at IGN |publisher=Uk.retro.ign.com |date=2010-08-27 |accessdate=2011-01-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120602072944/http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/939/939361p1.html |archive-date=June 2, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> The game was also an early example of [[open world]], [[non-linear]] gameplay, and introduced innovations like [[Save file|saving]] on battery backup. It became one of the most influential games of the [[Third generation of video game consoles|8-bit era]], inspiring action-adventures like ''[[Metroid]]'' and RPGs like ''[[Final Fantasy]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|title=15 Most Influential Games of All Time: The Legend of Zelda|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/15influential/p9_01.html|accessdate=2010-01-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100311215239/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/15influential/p9_01.html|archive-date=March 11, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> ''Zelda'' has since remained the most prolific action-adventure game series through to the present day.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Most-prolific action-adventure video game series|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/6000/most-prolific-action-adventure-video-game-series|work=Guinness World Records|accessdate=April 17, 2012|date=January 1, 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Survival horror ===\n[[Survival horror]] games focus on fear and attempt to scare the player via traditional [[horror fiction]] elements such as atmospherics, [[death]], the [[undead]], [[blood]] and gore. One crucial [[gameplay]] element in many of these games is the low quantity of ammunition, or number of breakable [[melee weapons]]. Notable examples include ''[[Silent Hill]]'' and ''[[Resident Evil]]''.\n\n''[[Nostromo]]'' was the first survival horror game, developed by Akira Takiguchi, a [[Tokyo University]] student and [[Taito]] contractor, for the [[PET 2001]]. It was ported to the [[PC-6001]] by Masakuni Mitsuhashi (also known as Hiromi Ohba, later joined [[Game Arts]]), and published by [[ASCII Corporation|ASCII]] in 1981, exclusively for Japan.<ref>{{cite book |last=Szczepaniak |first=John |year=2014 |title=The Untold History of Japanese Game Developers |publisher=SMG Szczepaniak |volume=1 |pages=544\u2013573 |isbn=978-0-9929260-3-8 }}</ref>\n\n=== Metroidvania ===\n[[Metroidvania]] games are a subgenre of Platformer (named after its two first well-known franchises, ''[[Metroid]]'' and ''[[Castlevania]]'') that feature large interconnected world maps the player can explore, but access to parts of the world is limited by doors or other obstacles that can only be opened after the player has acquired special tools, weapons or abilities within the game. Acquiring such improvements also aids the player in defeating more difficult enemies and locating shortcuts and secret areas, and often includes retracing one's steps across the map. Metroidvanias usually do not consist of any linear gameplay and often involve lots of backtracking - especially after new powerups or tools have been obtained. Bossfights are also a staple of metroidvanias, without which they would be considered puzzle or adventure games {{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}.\n\n== Adventure ==\n{{main|Adventure game}}\n\n[[Adventure game]]s were some of the earliest games created, beginning with the text adventure ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure]]'' in the 1970s. That game was originally titled simply \"Adventure,\" and is the namesake of the genre. Over time, graphics have been introduced to the genre and the interface has evolved.\n\nUnlike adventure films, adventure games are not defined by story or content. Rather, adventure describes a manner of gameplay without reflex challenges or action. They normally require the player to solve various puzzles by interacting with people or the environment, most often in a non-confrontational way. It is considered a \"purist\" genre and tends to exclude anything which includes action elements beyond a [[mini game]].\n\nBecause they put little pressure on the player in the form of action-based challenges or time constraints, adventure games have had the unique ability to appeal to people who do not normally play video games. The genre peaked in popularity with the 1993 release of ''[[Myst]]'', the best-selling PC game of all time up to that point.<ref name=\"best-selling\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/simslivinlarge/news_2857556.html |title=The Sims overtakes Myst |accessdate=2008-03-17 |author=Walker, Trey |date=2002-03-22 |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5mVievash?url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/simslivinlarge/news_2857556.html |archive-date=January 3, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> The simple point and click interface, detailed worlds and casual pace made it accessible, and its sense of artistic surrealism caused news outlets such as ''[[Wired Magazine]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', and the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' to declare that the gaming industry had matured.<ref>{{cite web|author=Rothstein, Edward|date=1994-12-04|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F07E7DD1030F937A35751C1A962958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1|title=A New Art Form May Arise From the 'Myst'|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2008-03-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115195423/http://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/04/arts/a-new-art-form-may-arise-from-the-myst.html|archive-date=January 15, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Evenson, Laura|publisher=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|title=Interactive CD-ROMs come of age|date=1994-12-22|page=DAT36}}</ref> It had four proper sequels, but none managed to experience the same level of success. The success of ''Myst'' also inspired many others to create similar games with first person perspectives, surreal environments and minimal or no dialogue, but these neither recaptured the success of ''Myst'' nor of earlier personality-driven adventures.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nIn the late 1990s the genre suffered a large drop in popularity, mass-market releases became rare, and many proclaimed the adventure game to be dead. More accurately, it has become a niche genre. Adventure games are not entirely uncommon, but they tend to be very low budget in anticipation of modest sales. The genre was somewhat rejuvenated with the release of ''[[The Longest Journey]]'' in 1999, which emphasized stronger story elements and more interaction with different characters. A recent resurgence of adventure games on Nintendo consoles might signify a new interest in the genre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20070205/nixon_01.shtml|title=Bring Out Your Dead! Can Nintendo Breathe New Life into Adventure Games?|last=Nixon|first=Scott|date=2007-02-05|publisher=Gamasutra|accessdate=2009-01-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121232334/http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20070205/nixon_01.shtml|archive-date=November 21, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> A successful Kickstarter campaign in 2012, run by Doublefine Studios, also spoke to the continued interest in Adventure games. The game produced as a result was mired in controversy and production delays, and to some, signalled the true end of the genre outside of niche markets.\n\n=== Text adventures ===\n\nThe earliest adventure games were text adventures, also known as [[interactive fiction]]. Games such as the popular ''[[Zork]]'' series of the late 1970s and early 1980s allowed the player to use a keyboard to enter commands such as \"get rope\" or \"go west\" while the computer describes what is happening. A great deal of programming went into [[text parser|parsing]] the player's text input.\n\n=== Graphic adventures ===\n\n[[File:Mystery House - Apple II render emulation - 2.png|thumb|250px|right|''[[Mystery House]]'' for the [[Apple II family|Apple II]] was the first adventure game to use graphics in the early [[home computer]] era.]]\n[[Graphic adventure game]]s emerged as graphics became more common. Adventure games began to supplement and later on replace textual descriptions with visuals (for example, a picture of the current location). Early graphic adventure games used text-parsers to input commands. The growing use of [[computer mouse|mice]] led to the \"[[point-and-click]]\" genre of adventure games, where the player would no longer have to type commands. The player could, for example, click on a hand [[icon (computing)|icon]] and then on a rope to pick up the rope.\n\n=== Visual novels ===\n{{main|visual novel}}\n\nA {{Nihongo|[[visual novel]]|\u30d3\u30b8\u30e5\u30a2\u30eb\u30ce\u30d9\u30eb|bijuaru noberu}} is a game featuring mostly static graphics, usually with [[anime]]-style art. As the name might suggest, they resemble mixed-media novels or [[tableau vivant]] stage plays. Many visual novels track statistics that the player must build in order to advance the plot, and permit a variety of endings, allowing more dynamic reactions to the player's actions than a typical linear adventure plot. Many visual novels are dating sims, including [[bish\u014djo game]]s. Visual novels are especially prevalent in [[Japan]], where they make up nearly 70% of PC games released.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=2009-01-23 |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/pressrelease.php?id=1510 |title=AMN and Anime Advanced Announce Anime Game Demo Downloads |publisher=Anime News Network |date=2006-02-08}}</ref> They are rarely produced for video game consoles, but the more popular games are sometimes [[Porting|ported]] to systems such as the [[Dreamcast]] or the [[PlayStation 2]]. The market for visual novels outside Japan, however, was nearly non-existent prior to the success of the [[Nintendo DS]], for which several Japanese visual novels were released in the West, such as the ''[[Ace Attorney]]'' series.\n\n=== Interactive movie ===\n\nThe [[interactive movie]] genre came about with the invention of [[laserdisc]]s. An interactive movie contains pre-filmed [[full motion video|full-motion]] [[cartoon]]s or live-action sequences, where the player controls some of the moves of the main character. For example, when in danger, the player decides which move, action, or combination to choose. In these games, the only activity the player has is to choose or guess the move the [[game designer|designers]] intend him to make. Interactive movies usually differ from games that simply use [[Full motion video based game|full motion video]], FMV, extensively between scenes in that they try to integrate it into the gameplay itself. This has been used in everything from racing games to fighting games. A few adventure game have tried to use the term to liken the storytelling of their games to those in movies, most notably the later ''[[Tex Murphy]]'' games and the more recent ''[[Fahrenheit (2005 video game)|Fahrenheit (Indigo Prophecy)]]'',<ref name=\"1up\">{{cite web|accessdate=2009-01-23 |url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=0&cId=3143998 |title=Indigo Prophecy\u2013Developer's Diary |publisher=1UP |date=2005-09-22 |author=Cage, David |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513025716/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=0&cId=3143998 |archivedate=2013-05-13 }}</ref> although they are more aptly classified as genre hybrids. Elements of interactive movies have been adapted for game [[cut scene]]s, in the form of [[Quick Time Event]]s, to keep the player alert. Games like ''[[Resident Evil 4]]'' present obvious in-game prompts for the player to react to. Not doing so usually results in the player character either getting hurt or outright killed.\n\n=== Real-time 3D adventures ===\n\nAround this time, real-time 3D adventure games appeared. These included ''[[Nightfall (video game)|Nightfall]]'' in 1998, ''[[Shenmue]]'' in 1999, ''[[Myst|realMyst]]'' in 2000, ''[[Shadow of Memories]]'' in 2001, and ''[[Uru: Ages Beyond Myst]]'' in 2003. They augmented traditional adventure gameplay with some of the attributes more commonly associated with action games. For example, freedom of motion and physics-based behavior.\n\n== Role-playing ==\n{{main|Role-playing video game}}\n{{see also|History of role-playing video games}}\n[[File:KQ-hitpoints.png|thumb|right|''KQ'' is a role-playing game]]\n\n[[Role-playing video game]]s draw their gameplay from traditional [not always] [[role-playing game]]s like ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''. Most of these games cast the player in the role of one or more \"adventurers\" who specialize in specific skill sets (such as melee combat or ranged [[Magic (gaming)|magic]] spells) while progressing through a predetermined storyline. Many involve manoeuvring these character(s) through an [[overworld]], usually populated with monsters, that allows access to more important game locations, such as towns, dungeons, and castles. Since the emergence of affordable [[home computer]]s coincided with the popularity of [[paper and pencil game|paper and pencil]] role-playing games, this genre was one of the first in video games and continues to be popular today. Gameplay elements strongly associated with RPG, such as statistical character development through the acquisition of [[experience point]]s, have been widely adapted to other genres such as [[action-adventure game]]s. Though nearly all of the early entries in the genre were [[turn-based game]]s, many modern role-playing games progress in real-time. Thus, the genre has followed the [[strategy game]]'s trend of moving from turn-based to real-time combat. The move to real-time combat began with the release of [[Square (video game company)|Square]]'s (now [[Square Enix]]'s) ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]'', the first game to use the [[Final Fantasy battle systems#Active Time Battle|Active Time Battle]] system; this was quickly followed by truly real-time action role-playing games such as the [[Mana (series)|''Mana'' series]], ''[[Soul Blazer]]'' and ''[[Ultima VII]]''. Although older turn-based system still exist, such as the [[Golden Sun (series)|''Golden Sun'']] series for [[Game Boy Advance]] as well as ''[[Pok\u00e9mon]]''.\n\n=== Action RPG ===\n[[File:Freedroidrpg basic gameplay.ogv|thumb|left|Video showing basic point and click action RPG gameplay.]]\nThe [[action role-playing game]] or action RPG is a type of [[role-playing video game]] which incorporates real-time combat as opposed to turn-based or menu-based, often borrowing elements from [[action game]]s or [[action-adventure game]]s. Some of the first action role-playing games were produced by [[Nihon Falcom]] in the 1980s, such as the [[Dragon Slayer (series)|''Dragon Slayer'' series]] and [[Ys (video game series)|''Ys'' series]]. Later so-called \"''[[Diablo (video game)|Diablo]]'' clones\" are also part of this genre. Although the precise definition of the genre varies, the typical action RPG features a heavy emphasis on combat, often simplifying or removing non-combat attributes and statistics and the effect they have on the character's development.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rpgdot.com/index.php?hsaction=10053&ID=1007 |title=The Action RPG Revolution |accessdate=2007-03-02 |last=Turner |first=Brian |date=2004-07-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051101204302/http://www.rpgdot.com/index.php?hsaction=10053&ID=1007 |archivedate=November 1, 2005 }}</ref> Additionally, combat always takes place using a real-time system (hence the \"action\") that relies on the player's ability to perform particular actions with speed and accuracy to determine success, rather than mainly using the player character's attributes to determine this.\n\n=== MMORPG ===\n[[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]s, or MMORPG, emerged in the mid to late 1990s as a commercial, [[graphical game|graphical]] variant of text-based [[MUD]]s, which had existed since 1978. By and large, MMORPG feature the usual RPG objectives of completing quests and strengthening one's [[player character]], but involve up to hundreds of players interacting with each other on the same persistent world in real-time. The massively multiplayer concept was quickly combined with other genres. Fantasy MMORPG, like ''[[Final Fantasy XI]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar]]'', and ''[[The Elder Scrolls Online]]'', remain the most popular type of MMOG, with the most popular \"pay-to-play\" game being ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', and the most popular \"[[free-to-play]]\" games including ''[[RuneScape]]'' and ''[[TERA (video game)|TERA]]'', yet other types of MMORPG are appearing. Sci-fi MMORPG like ''[[Phantasy Star Online]]'' hold a smaller part of the market, with the popular space sci-fi game ''[[EVE Online]]'' being the most notable. Other massively multiplayer online games which do not have a conventional RPG setting include [[Second Life]] and [[Ingress (game)|Ingress]].\n\n=== Roguelikes ===\n[[File:Nethack screenshot.png|thumbnail|left|''[[NetHack]]'' is a roguelike game.  The text display seen here is common in games in the roguelike genre.]]\nThe [[roguelike]] video game subgenre borrows its name and gameplay elements from the 1980 computer game ''[[Rogue (computer game)|Rogue]]''. Superficially, a roguelike is a two-dimensional [[dungeon crawl]] with a high degree of randomness and an emphasis on statistical character development. Though traditionally featuring a text user interface, many such games utilize graphic tiles to overcome character set limitations.\n\n=== Tactical RPG ===\nThe [[tactical role-playing game]] subgenre principally refers to games which incorporate gameplay from [[strategy video game|strategy games]] as an alternative to traditional RPG systems.<ref name=\"EATRPG\">{{cite web |accessdate=2009-01-23 |url=http://www.ea.com/official/lordoftherings/tactics/us/whatis.jsp |title=What is Tactics? |publisher=Electronic Arts |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925180218/http://www.ea.com/official/lordoftherings/tactics/us/whatis.jsp |archive-date=September 25, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> Like standard RPG, the player controls a finite party and battles a similar number of enemies, but this genre incorporates strategic gameplay such as tactical movement on an isometric grid.<ref name=\"EATRPG\"/> The genre has its origins in [[tabletop role-playing game]]s, where each player has time to decide his or her characters' actions.\n\n=== Sandbox RPG ===\nSandbox RPG or [[Open world|Open World RPG]] allow the player a large amount of freedom and usually contain a somewhat more open free-roaming (meaning the player is not confined to a single path restricted by rocks or fences etc.) world. Sandbox RPGs contain similarities to other sandbox games such as the [[Grand Theft Auto]] series, with a large number of interactable non-player characters, large amount of content and typically some of the largest worlds to explore and longest playtimes of all RPG due to an impressive amount of secondary content not critical to the game's main storyline. Sandbox RPG often attempt to emulate an entire region of their setting. Popular examples of this subgenre include the ''[[Dragon Slayer (series)|Dragon Slayer]]'' series by [[Nihon Falcom]], the early ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' games by [[Chunsoft]], ''[[Zelda II]]'' by [[Nintendo]], ''[[Wasteland (video game)|Wasteland]]'' by [[Interplay Entertainment]], the ''[[SaGa (series)|SaGa]]'' and ''[[Mana (series)|Mana]]'' series by [[Squaresoft]], ''[[System Shock 2]]'' by [[Irrational Games]] and [[Looking Glass Studios]], ''[[Deus Ex (video game)|Deus Ex]]'' by [[Ion Storm]], ''[[The Elder Scrolls]]'' and [[Fallout series|''Fallout'' series]] by [[Bethesda Softworks]] and [[Interplay Entertainment]], ''[[Fable (2004 video game)|Fable]]'' by [[Lionhead Studios]], the [[Gothic series|''Gothic'' series]] by [[Piranha Bytes]], and the ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles]]'' series by [[Monolith Soft]].\n\n===JRPG===\nA role-playing game made in Japan but has since encapsulated a new kind of game not just made in Japan. Some games include ''[[Chrono Trigger]]'' for the SNES, ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'', and many more.\n\n===First-person party-based RPG===\n[[File:DOTGv0.31screenshot.png|thumb|right|Screenshot of ''Damnation of Gods'', a ''Dungeon Master'' clone. All four members of the players's party move around the game world as a single unit in first-person perspective.]]\nAlso known as DRPG (Dungeon RPG), this subgenre consists of RPGs where the player leads a party of adventurers in [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]] through a dungeon or labyrinth, typically in a grid-based environment. Examples include the aforementioned ''Wizardry'', ''Might and Magic'' and ''Bard's Tale'' series; as well as the ''[[Etrian Odyssey (series)|Etrian Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Elminage]]'' series. Games of this type are also known as \"blobbers\", since the player moves the entire party around the playing field as a single unit, or \"blob\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/12/05/the-rpgs-of-2017/ |title=The RPGs of 2017 |last=Cobbett |first=Richard |date=December 5, 2016 |website=Rock, Paper, Shotgun |publisher=Rock, Paper, Shotgun |access-date=2017-05-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170415020146/https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/12/05/the-rpgs-of-2017/ |archive-date=April 15, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/FelipePepe/20150625/244262/CRPG_History_Abridged__21_RPGs_that_brought_something_new_to_the_table.php |title=CRPG History Abridged - 21 RPGs that brought something new to the table |last=Pepe |first=Felipe |date=June 25, 2015 |website=Gamasutra |publisher=UBM |access-date=2017-05-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170524090937/http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/FelipePepe/20150625/244262/CRPG_History_Abridged__21_RPGs_that_brought_something_new_to_the_table.php |archive-date=May 24, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nMost \"blobbers\" are turn-based, but some titles such as the ''Dungeon Master'', ''[[Legend of Grimrock]]'', and ''[[Eye of the Beholder (video game)|Eye of the Beholder]]'' series are played in real-time. Early games in this genre lack an [[automap]] feature, forcing players to draw their own maps in order to keep track of their progress. Environmental and spatial puzzles are common, meaning players may have to, for instance, move a stone in one part of the level in order to open a gate in another part of the level.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n== Simulation ==\n{{main|Simulation video game}}\n\n[[Simulation video game]]s is a diverse super-category of games, generally designed to closely simulate aspects of a real or fictional reality.\n\n=== Construction and management simulation ===\n{{main|Construction and management simulation}}\n[[File:Lincity-ng.png|thumb|A sample city from ''[[Lincity|Lincity NG]]'']]\n[[Construction and management simulation]]s (or CMS) are a type of simulation game which task players to build, expand or manage fictional communities or projects with limited resources.\n\nIn [[city-building game]]s the player acts as overall planner or leader to meet the needs and wants of game characters by initiating structures for food, shelter, health, spiritual care, economic growth, etc. Success is achieved when the city budget makes a growing profit and citizens experience an upgraded lifestyle in housing, health, and goods. While military development is often included, the emphasis is on economic strength. Perhaps the most known game of this type is ''[[SimCity]]'', which is still popular and has had great influence on later city-building games. ''SimCity'', however, also belongs to the ''God Games'' genre since it gives the player god-like abilities in manipulating the world. [[Caesar (video game)|Caesar]] was a long-running series in this genre, with the original game spawning three sequels.\n\n[[Business simulation game]]s generally attempt to simulate an economy or business, with the player controlling the economy of the game.\n\nA [[government simulation game]] (or \"political game\") involves the simulation of the policies, government or politics of a country, but typically excludes warfare. Recently, these types of games have gained the moniker \"[[serious game]]\".\n\n=== Life simulation ===\n{{main|Life simulation game}}\n\n[[Life simulation game]]s (or artificial life games) involve living or controlling one or more artificial lives. A life simulation game can revolve around individuals and relationships, or it could be a simulation of an ecosystem.\n\nBiological simulations may allow the player to experiment with [[genetics]], [[wikt:survival|survival]] or [[ecosystem]]s, often in the form of an [[Serious game|educational package]]. An early example is ''[[SimLife]]'', while relatively recent ones are ''[[Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis]]'' and ''[[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]]''. In other educational simulations such as ''[[Wolf (game)|Wolf]]'', the player \"lives the life\" of an individual animal in a relatively realistic way. Hailed as one of the greatest life simulation games, however, is Creatures, Creatures 2, Creatures 3, where the player breeds generations of a species in a hugely detailed ecosystem.\n\nUnlike other genres of games, [[god game]]s often do not have a set goal that allows a player to win the game. The focus of a god game tends to be control over the lives of people, anywhere from micromanaging a family to overseeing the rise of a civilization.\n\n[[Pet-raising simulation]]s (or [[digital pet]]s) focus more on the relationship between the player and one or few life forms. They are often more limited in scope than other biological simulations. This includes popular examples of [[virtual pets]] such as ''[[Tamagotchi]]'', the ''[[Petz]]'' series, and ''[[Nintendogs]]''.\n\n[[Social simulation game]]s base their gameplay on the [[social interaction]] between multiple artificial lives. The most famous example from this genre is Will Wright's ''[[The Sims]]''. [[Dating sim|Dating sims]] and Romance simulation games fall under this category.\n\n=== Vehicle simulation ===\n{{main|Vehicle simulation game}}\n\n[[Vehicle simulation game]]s are a genre of [[video games]] which attempt to provide the player with a realistic interpretation of operating various kinds of vehicles.<ref name=\"Rollings1\">{{harvnb|Rollings|2003|pp=395\u2013415}}</ref>\n\n[[File:FG-A-10.jpg|thumb|''[[FlightGear]]'' is a flight simulation game.|alt=|230x230px]]\n\nA [[Flight simulation#Flight Simulators at Home|flight simulation]] tasks the player with flying an aircraft, usually an airplane, as realistically as possible. [[Combat flight simulator]]s are the most popular subgenre of simulation. The player controls the plane, not only simulating the act of flying, but also combat situations. There are also civilian flight simulators that do not have the combat aspect.\n\n[[Racing game]]s typically place the player in the driver's seat of a high-performance vehicle and require the player to race against other drivers or sometimes just time. This genre of games is one of the staples of the computer gaming world and many of the earliest computer games created were part of this genre. Emerging in the late 1970s, this genre is still very popular today and continues to push the envelope in terms of graphics and performance. These games \"tend to fall into ''organized racing'' and ''imaginary racing'' categories\". Organized racing simulators attempt to \"reproduce the experience of driving a racing car or motorcycle in an existing racing class: [[Indycar]], [[NASCAR]], [[Formula 1]], and so on.\" On the other hand, imaginary racing games involve \"imaginary situations, driving madly through cities or the countryside or even fantasy environments\". These \"imaginary\" racing games are sometimes called arcade racing games, in contrast to their more realistic \"racing simulation\" counterparts. These include ''[[Need For Speed]]'', ''[[Mario Kart]]'' and ''[[Gran Turismo (series)|Gran Turismo]]''. Rollings and Adams note that \"racing games are often sold in the [[sports game|sports]] category,\" but \"from a [[video game design|design]] standpoint, they really belong in ... vehicle simulations\".<ref name=\"Rollings1\"/>\n\n[[Space flight simulator game]]s are a subgenre that involve piloting a [[spacecraft]]. Space simulators are different from other subgenres, and are not generally considered to be simulators, as their simulated objects do not always exist and often disregard the laws of physics.\n\n[[Train simulator]]s simulate the vehicles, environments and often economics associated with railway transport. These are frequently historical in nature, reminiscing on the evolution and emergence of the railroad in various countries and the economic booms that often accompanied them.\n\n[[Vehicular combat]] or ''car combat'' games focus on fast-paced action, as the player operates a [[car]] or other vehicle and attempts to disable or destroy [[CPU]] or human opponents. Vehicular combat games often allow a player to choose from a variety of potential vehicles, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Vehicular combat was born out of racing/shooter combinations like ''[[Spy Hunter]]'', ''[[RoadBlasters]]'', and ''[[Rock 'N' Roll Racing]]'', but differs in that the players can, if desired, take their vehicles off predefined routes and do battle wherever they please. A subgenre of vehicular combat is ''[[Mecha]]'' combat, where vehicles generally include giant robot-like tanks.\n\n== Strategy ==\n{{main|Strategy video game}}\n\n[[Strategy video game]]s focus on gameplay requiring careful and skillful thinking and planning in order to achieve victory and the action scales from world domination to squad-based tactics. \u201cIn most strategy video games,\u201d says Andrew Rollings, \"the player is given a godlike view of the game world, indirectly controlling the units under his command.\"<ref name=\"Rollings2\">{{harvnb|Rollings|2003|pp=321\u2013345}}</ref> Rollings also notes that \"The origin of strategy games is rooted in their close cousins, board games.\"<ref name=\"Rollings2\"/> Strategy video games generally take one of four archetypal forms, depending on whether the game is '''turn-based or real-time''' and whether the game's focus is upon '''strategy or tactics'''. Real time strategy games are often a multiple unit selection game (multiple game characters can be selected at once to perform different tasks, as opposed to only selecting one character at a time)  with a sky view (view looking down from above) but some recent games such as Tom Clancy's [[EndWar]], are single unit selection and third person view. Like many RPG games, many strategy games are gradually moving away from turn-based systems to more real-time systems.\n\n=== 4X game ===\n{{Main|4X game}}\n[[4X game|4X]] refers to a genre of strategy video game with four primary goals: eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate. A 4X game can be [[turn-based]] or [[real-time strategy|real-time]]. Perhaps the best known example of this genre is [[Sid Meier]]'s ''[[Civilization (computer game)|Civilization]]'' series. 4X games often cover a very large period of time, giving the player the control of an entire civilization or species. Typically these games have a historical setting, encompassing a large amount of human history ([[Empire Earth]], Civilization, Golden Age of Civilizations) or a science fiction setting where the player controls a species set to dominate the galaxy ([[Master of Orion]], [[Galactic Civilizations]]).\n\n=== Artillery game ===\n[[File:Scorched 3D 40.1 screenshot 2.jpg|thumb|220x220px|''[[Scorched 3D]]'' is an artillery game.]]\n{{Main|Artillery game}}\n[[Artillery game|Artillery]] is the generic name for early two or three-player (usually [[turn-based]]) computer games involving [[tank]]s fighting each other in combat or similar derivative games. Artillery games were among the earliest computer games developed and can be considered an extension of the original use of computers, which were once used for military-based calculations such as plotting the trajectories of rockets. Artillery games are considered a type of [[turn-based tactics]] game, though they have also been described as a type of \"shooting game.\" Examples of this genre are ''[[Pocket Tanks]]'', ''[[Hogs of War]]'', ''[[Scorched 3D]]'' and the ''[[Worms (series)|Worms]]'' series.\n\n=== {{anchor|Auto battler}}Auto battler (Auto chess) ===\n{{Main|Auto battler}}\n[[Auto battler]], also known as \"auto chess\", is a type of strategy game that features [[chess]]-like elements where players place characters on a grid-shaped battlefield during a preparation phase, who then fight the opposing team's characters without any further direct input from the player.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/08/01/what-is-an-auto-battler/|title=Spawn Point: What on earth is an auto battler?|last1=Cox|first1=Matt|website=Rock, Paper, Shotgun|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190803125851/https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/08/01/what-is-an-auto-battler/|archive-date=August 3, 2019|accessdate=3 August 2019}}</ref> It was created and popularized by ''[[Dota Auto Chess]]'' in early 2019, and saw more games in the genre by other studios, such as ''[[Teamfight Tactics]]'', ''[[Dota Underlords]]'', and ''[[Hearthstone Battlegrounds]]'' releasing soon after.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/07/04/a-guide-to-auto-chess-tft-league-of-legends-teamfight-tactics-dota-underlords|title=An Introduction to Auto Chess, Teamfight Tactics and Dota Underlords|last1=Gilroy|first1=Joab|website=IGN|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190704045655/https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/07/04/a-guide-to-auto-chess-tft-league-of-legends-teamfight-tactics-dota-underlords|archive-date=July 4, 2019|accessdate=July 10, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/a-guide-to-auto-chess-2019-s-most-popular-new-game-gen-1835820155|title=A Guide To Auto Chess, 2019\u2019s Most Popular New Game Genre|last1=Grayson|first1=Nathan|website=Kotaku|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190703221157/https://kotaku.com/a-guide-to-auto-chess-2019-s-most-popular-new-game-gen-1835820155|archive-date=July 3, 2019|accessdate=July 21, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/1/20943670/blizzcon-2019-announcement-hearthstone-battlegrounds-auto-chess|title=Blizzard announces Hearthstone Battlegrounds, a new autobattler set in the Warcraft Universe|last=Goslin|first=Austen|date=2019-11-01|website=Polygon|language=en|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref>\n\n=== Multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) ===\n{{Main|Multiplayer online battle arena}}\n[[File:Vainglory Halcyon Fold map.tif|thumb|281x281px|''[[Vainglory (video game)|Vainglory]]'' is a multiplayer online battle arena game designed for smartphones and tablets.|alt=]]\n[[Multiplayer online battle arena]] (MOBA) is a genre of strategy video games that originated as a subgenre of [[real-time strategy]] in which each player controls a single character in a team to compete with another team of players. The objective is to destroy the opposing team's main structure with the assistance of computer-controlled units, which periodically [[Spawning (gaming)|spawn]] in groups at the base and marching down predefined paths (called \"lanes\") toward the enemy base. Every [[player character]] typically has its own diverse kit with unique abilities, design, strengths, and weaknesses. Player characters grow in power over the course of a match and learn new thematic abilities, which contribute to a team's overall strategy. Multiplayer online battle arena games are a fusion of [[real-time strategy games]], [[Role-playing video game|role-playing games]], and [[Action game|action games]], though players usually do not construct either buildings or units.\n\nThe genre gained popularity in the 2010s, with ''[[Defense of the Ancients]]'' mod for ''[[Warcraft III]]'', ''[[League of Legends]]'', ''[[Dota 2]]'', ''[[Heroes of the Storm]]'', and ''[[Smite (video game)|Smite]]'' being popular.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.progamerreview.com/best-moba-games/|title=Best Modern MOBA Games - LoL, Dota 2, HotS & Smite Compared|last=Amstrup|first=Johannes|last2=ersen|date=2017-09-15|website=Pro Gamer Reviews|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-19}}</ref> The genre is also well-represented in [[esports]].\n\n=== Real-time strategy (RTS) ===\n{{Main|Real-time strategy}}\nThe moniker \"[[real-time strategy]]\" (RTS), usually applied only to certain computer strategy games, (however, this genre is probably the most well known of strategy games and is what most websites mean when they say \"strategy games\") indicates that the action in the game is continuous, and players will have to make their decisions and actions within the backdrop of a constantly changing game state. Real-time strategy gameplay is characterised by obtaining resources, building bases, researching technologies and producing units. Blizzard Entertainment's ''[[Starcraft]]'' is a popular RTS played competitively in South Korea and televised to large audiences. Other notable games include the [[Warcraft (series)|''Warcraft'' series]], [[Age of Empires|''Age of Empires'' series]], ''[[Dawn of War]]'', ''[[Command and Conquer]]'', and ''[[Dune II]]'' (essentially the first RTS game). Outside of PCs, very few strategy games are real-time; a few examples are ''[[Battle for Middle-earth II]]'', ''[[Pikmin]]'' and ''[[Halo Wars]]''. Even fewer ones use physical pieces, such as ''[[Icehouse (game)|Icehouse]]''.\n\n=== Real-time tactics (RTT) ===\n{{Main|Real-time tactics}}\n[[Real-time tactics]] (abbreviated RTT<ref name=\"ign-stateoftherts\">{{cite web|url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/700/700747p3.html|title=The State of the RTS|work=[[IGN]]|date=April 7, 2006|accessdate=September 14, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060624224943/http://pc.ign.com/articles/700/700747p3.html|archive-date=June 24, 2006|url-status=live}}(Article at IGN discussing their perception of RTS and related genres as of 2006.

It is also sometimes considered a subgenre of [[real-time strategy]], and thus may in this context exist as an element of gameplay or as a basis for the whole game. It is differentiated from [[real-time strategy]] gameplay by the lack of resource [[micromanagement]] and base or unit building, as well as the greater importance of individual units<ref name=\"ign-stateoftherts\"/><ref name=splanet>{{cite web | title =Point - CounterPoint: Resource Collection vs. Fixed Units | publisher =StrategyPlanet | url =http://www.strategyplanet.com/features/articles/pcp-resources/ | accessdate =2007-11-04 | url-status =dead | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071231194439/http://www.strategyplanet.com/features/articles/pcp-resources/ | archivedate =2007-12-31 }}</ref> and a focus on complex battlefield tactics. Example titles include ''[[Warhammer: Dark Omen]]'', ''[[World In Conflict]]'', the ''[[Close Combat (game)|Close Combat]]'' series, and early [[tactical role-playing game]]s such as ''[[Bokosuka Wars]]'', ''[[Kure Software Koubou|Silver Ghost]]'', and ''First Queen''.\n\n=== Tower defense ===\n{{Main|Tower defense}}\n[[Tower defense]] games have a very simple layout. Usually, computer-controlled monsters called ''creeps'' move along a set path, and the player must place, or \"build\" towers along this path to kill the creeps. In some games, towers are placed along a set path for creeps, while in others towers can interrupt creep movement and change their path. In most tower defense games different towers have different abilities such as poisoning enemies or slowing them down. The player is awarded money for killing creeps, and this money can be used to buy more towers, or buy upgrades for a tower such as increased power or range.\n\n=== Turn-based strategy (TBS) ===\n{{Main|Turn-based strategy}}\n[[File:Battle for wesnoth version 1.12.0 screenshot.jpg|thumb|235x235px|''[[The Battle for Wesnoth]]'' is a turn-based strategy game.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=2009-01-23 |url=http://pc.ign.com/objects/142/14240090.html |title=The Battle for Wesnoth |publisher=IGN |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205044129/http://pc.ign.com/objects/142/14240090.html |archive-date=December 5, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref>]]\nThe term [[turn-based strategy]] (TBS) is usually reserved for certain computer strategy games, to distinguish them from real-time strategy games. A player of a turn-based game is allowed a period of analysis before committing to a game action, and some games allow a certain number of moves or actions to take place in a turn. Like real-time strategy games, this genre can include many strategy games which are not solely turn-based games, and games which may contain other features not related to whether the game is turn-based or not. Examples of this genre are the ''[[Civilization computer game|Civilization]]'', ''[[Heroes of Might and Magic]]'', ''[[Making History (game)|Making History]],'' and ''[[Master of Orion]]''.\n\nSome recent turn-based strategy games feature a different gameplay mechanic, with a simultaneous resolution of the turns, every player preparing their future actions in the planning phase, then letting the game follow the orders given at the same time, causing orders to be interrupted by the opponent(s) actions, changing the gameplay from reacting to the opponent's action into guessing them.\n\n=== Turn-based tactics (TBT) ===\n{{Main|Turn-based tactics}}\nThe gameplay of [[turn-based tactics]] games (TBT) is characterized by the expectation of players to complete their tasks using the combat forces provided to them, and usually by the provision of a realistic (or at least believable) representation of military tactics and operations. Examples of this genre include the ''[[Wars (series)|Wars]]'', ''[[Jagged Alliance]]'' and ''[[X-COM]]'' series, as well as [[tactical role-playing game]]s such as the ''[[Fire Emblem]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics]]''.\n\n=== Wargame ===\n{{Main|Wargame (video games)}}\n[[Wargame (video games)|Wargames]] are a [[subgenre]] of [[strategy video game]]s that emphasize strategic or tactical warfare on a map. Wargames generally take one of four archetypal forms, depending on whether the game is turn-based or real-time and whether the game's focus is upon [[military strategy]] or [[military tactics|tactics]].\n\n=== Grand strategy wargame ===\n{{Main|Grand strategy wargame}}\nA [[grand strategy wargame]] is a [[Wargaming|wargame]] that places focus on [[grand strategy]]: military [[strategy]] at the level of movement and use of an entire [[nation state]] or [[empire]]'s resources.\n\n== Sports ==\nSports are video games that simulate [[sports]]. This opposing team(s) can be controlled by other real life people or artificial intelligence.\n\n=== Racing ===\nOne competes against time or opponents using some means of transportation. Sub-genres include [[Sim racing|racing simulators]] (''[[Gran Turismo (series)|Gran Turismo]]'') and [[kart racing game|kart racing]] (''[[Mario Kart]]'').\n\n=== Sports game ===\n[[Sports game]]s emulate the playing of traditional physical [[sports]]. Some emphasize actually playing the sport, while others emphasize the strategy behind the sport (such as ''[[Championship Manager series|Championship Manager]]''). Others satirize the sport for comic effect (such as ''[[Arch Rivals]]''). One of the best selling series in this genre is the ''[[FIFA (video game series)|FIFA]]'' series. This genre emerged early in the history of video games (e.g., ''[[Pong]]'') and remains popular today.\n\n=== Competitive ===\nGames that have high competitive factor but does not represent any traditional sports or the concept is fictional designed by the developer (e.g. [[Ball Jacks]]).\n\n=== Sports-based fighting ===\n\nSports-based fighting games are titles that fall firmly within the definitions of both the Fighting game and Sports game genre, such as boxing and wrestling video games. As such, they are usually put in their own separate subgenres. Often the fighting is far more realistic than in traditional fighting games (though the amount of realism can greatly vary), and many feature real-world franchises or fighters. Examples of this include the [[Fight Night (EA video game series)|''Fight Night'']], ''[[UFC (video game)|UFC]]'' and ''[[WWE 2K]]'' series.\n\n== Other notable genres ==\n\n=== Board game or card game ===\nMany popular [[board game]]s and [[card game]]s have computer versions. [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] opponents can help improve one's skill at traditional games. [[Computer chess|Chess]], [[Draughts|Checkers]], Othello (also known as [[Reversi]]), and [[Backgammon]] have world class computer programs. [[Mahjong]] and related games are immensely popular in [[China]] and [[Japan]]. [[Go (game)|Go]] is popular in [[East Asia]], though it is notoriously difficult to program a [[Computer Go|computer to play Go]] well. \n\n=== Casual games ===\nCasual games are designed to be easily picked up and put down again, allowing for potentially short bursts of play, such as ''Call of Duty'' and most games on a mobile platform. This genre of gaming is meant to be a short and relaxing pastime, a rest in between other occupations and so is most popular with demographics who have less free time. For this reason the games often have auto-saving and syncing as standard so the games can be minimised, put into sleep or otherwise put down with no loss to the player. Market leaders in this genre are often boldly coloured, designed for intuitive interaction and have a high balance of reward to time to keep people coming back. Designers of these games should add a lot of \"juice\" (sound and motion elements that excite the senses) to make them stand out in a sea of highly similar games.\n\nDue to the aforementioned requirements, many of these games are quite simple to pick up and play without lengthy tutorials. Retaining players involves a lot of careful design of levels, challenges and events.\n\n=== Digital collectible card game ===\nA [[digital collectible card game]] (DCCG) is a computer or video game usually played online that emulates [[Collectible card game|collectible card games]] (CCG), or in many cases, doesn't use card-like images at all, but instead [[Icons (computing)|icons]], [[Avatar (computing)|avatars]] or other symbols to represent game pieces. Originally, DCCGs started out as replications of a CCG's physical counterpart such as ''[[Magic: The Gathering]],'' but many DCCGs have foregone a physical version and exclusively release as a video game, such as with ''[[Hearthstone]]''.\n\n=== Logic game ===\nLogic games require the player to solve [[logic]] puzzles or navigate complex locations such as [[maze]]s. They are well suited to [[Casual game|casual play]], and [[Tile-matching video game|tile-matching puzzle games]] are among the most popular casual games. This genre frequently crosses over with adventure and educational games. ''[[Tetris]]'', labeled a puzzle game, is credited for revolutionizing gaming and popularizing the puzzle genre.\n\n=== MMO ===\n{{Main|Massively multiplayer online game}}\nA [[massively multiplayer online game]] (also called MMO and MMOG) is a [[multiplayer video game]] which is capable of supporting large numbers of players simultaneously. By necessity, they are played on the [[Internet]]. Many games have at least one [[persistent world]], however others just have large numbers of players competing at once in one form or another without any lasting effect to the world at all. These games can be found for most network-capable platforms, including the [[personal computer]], [[video game console]], or [[smartphone]]s and other mobile devices.\n\nMMO games can enable players to cooperate and compete with each other on a large scale, and sometimes to interact meaningfully with people around the world. They include a variety of gameplay types, representing many video game genres, an example is the widely played game ''[[Minecraft]]'' which can be played both as an MMO or a single player game.\n\n===Mobile game===\nMobile games are played on devices like phones and tablets, and are usually easy games for casual gamers.\nGames like ''[[Candy Crush Saga]]'' and ''[[Angry Birds]]'' are mobile games. Some mobile games are ported from consoles or computers,\nlike ''[[Minecraft]]'', ''[[Plants vs Zombies]]'', and ''[[Fortnite]]''. Mobile games are usually made for casual gamers and\ncan be played and completed easily, so they can be played by people of all ages.\n\n=== Party game ===\n[[Party games#Party video games|Party games]] are video games developed specifically for multiplayer games between many players. Normally, party games have a variety of [[mini-game]]s that range between collecting more of a certain item than other players or having the fastest time at something. Such games include the ''[[Mario Party]]'' series, ''[[Crash Bash]]'', and ''[[Rayman Raving Rabbids]]''. Versus multiplayer games are not generally considered to be party games.\n\n=== Programming game ===\nA [[programming game]] is a [[computer game]] where the player has no direct influence on the course of the game. Instead, a [[computer program]] or script is written in some [[domain-specific programming language]] in order to control the actions of the characters (usually [[robot]]s, [[tank]]s or [[bacteria]], which seek to destroy each other). In ''[[SpaceChem]]'', for example, players design circuits used for creating molecules from raw materials. ''[[Final Fantasy XII]]'' also includes some elements of a programming game, as the player creates the AI of his characters, although the player can also choose to directly control the action.\n\n=== Trivia game ===\n[[Trivia]] games are growing in popularity, especially on [[mobile phone]]s where people may only have a few minutes to play the game. In trivia games, the object is to answer questions with the goal of obtaining points. They may be based on real-life trivia game shows such as ''[[Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader?]]'' or ''[[Family Feud]]''.\n\n==Idle gaming==\n{{Main|Incremental game}}\nIn an [[IGN]] article, ''[[Cookie Clicker]]'' is credited as one of the few games to have played a major role in the establishment of the genre of idle gaming.<ref name=\"IGN\">{{cite web |url=http://ca.ign.com/articles/2013/10/10/inside-cookie-clicker-and-the-idle-game-movement |title=Inside Cookie Clicker and the Idle Game Move |last=Davis |first=Justin |publisher=IGN |date=October 10, 2013 |accessdate=April 2, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630202207/http://ca.ign.com/articles/2013/10/10/inside-cookie-clicker-and-the-idle-game-movement |archive-date=June 30, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThis genre involves games that orient the player with a trivial task, such as clicking a cookie; and as the game progresses, the player is gradually rewarded certain upgrades for completing said task. In all, these games require very little involvement from the player, and in most cases they play themselves; hence the use of the word \"[[idle]]\".\n\nIn early 2014, Orteil released an early version of ''Idle Game Maker'', a tool allowing customized idle games to be made without coding knowledge.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://orteil.dashnet.org/experiments/idlegamemaker/help |title=Idle Game Maker Documentation |publisher=Orteil.dashnet.org |accessdate=2014-07-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714142951/http://orteil.dashnet.org/experiments/idlegamemaker/help |archive-date=July 14, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n== Video game genres by purpose ==\n\nWhile most video games are designed as entertainment, many video games are designed with additional purposes. These purposes are as varied as the nature of information itself\u2014to inform, persuade, or stimulate. These games can have any kind of gameplay, from puzzles to action to adventure.\n\n=== Advergame ===\n{{main|Advergame}}\n[[Advergame]]s, in the context of video game genres, refers to promotional software specifically made to advertise a product, organization or viewpoint. The first advergames were distributed on floppy disk by the [[Chef Boyardee]], [[Coca-Cola]], and [[Samsung]] brands,<ref name=gamedaily>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/features/dunkin-for-advergames/68443/?biz=1 |title=Dunkin' for Advergames |access-date=January 24, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230013119/http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/features/dunkin-for-advergames/68443/?biz=1 |archive-date=December 30, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> while the first cereal box advergame was [[Chex Quest]] in 1996.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.joystiq.com/2008/04/18/ask-joystiq-chex-quest-he-man-and-broken-360-gamepads/ | title = Ask Joystiq: Chex Quest, He-Man and broken 360 gamepads | publisher = Joystiq | author = Ross Miller | date = April 18, 2008 | accessdate = 2008-07-16 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080517003720/http://www.joystiq.com/2008/04/18/ask-joystiq-chex-quest-he-man-and-broken-360-gamepads/ | archive-date = May 17, 2008 | url-status = dead }}</ref> The majority of advergames are found online and mostly include simple and cheaply made [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] games. Some advergames were released to consoles, like [[Pepsiman (video game)|Pepsiman]] for Sony PlayStation.\n\n=== Art game ===\n{{main|Art game}}\n[[Art game]]s are designed so as to emphasize art or whose structures are intended to produce some kind of non-[[ludology|ludological]] reaction in its audience. Art games typically go out of their way to have a unique, unconventional look, often standing out for aesthetic beauty or complexity in design. This concept extends to the realm of modified (\"modded\") gaming when modifications have been made to existing non-art-games to produce graphic results intended to be viewed as an artistic display, as opposed to modifications intended to change game play scenarios or for storytelling. Modified games created for artistic purposes are sometimes referred to as \"[[videogame art]].\"\n\n=== Casual game ===\n{{main|Casual game}}\n[[Casual game]]s have very simple rules or play techniques and a very low degree of strategy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6186207.html?tag=result;title;0 |title=GDC '08: Are casual games the future? |last=Boyes |first=Emma |date=2008-02-18 |publisher=GameSpot |accessdate=2009-01-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711072428/http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6186207.html?tag=result%3Btitle%3B0 |archivedate=2011-07-11 }}</ref> They also require no long-term time commitment or special skills to play, making them easy to learn and play as a pastime.

The purpose of the casual game is to entertain, but with a much lower commitment than other video games.\n\n=== Christian game ===\n{{main|Christian video games}}\n[[Christian video games|Christian games]] attempt to provide the dual purposes of spreading the [[Christianity|Christian religion]] to non-believers through the medium of video games, and providing gamers who identify as Christian with a common pool of games. Christian video games were first developed by [[Wisdom Tree]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]], without license. While largely regarded as derivative titles by the mainstream gaming culture,{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Christian games have nevertheless expanded in distribution since their inception.\n\n=== Educational game ===\n{{main|Educational game}}\n[[Educational game]]s, as the name implies, attempt to teach the user using the game as a vehicle. Most of these types of games target young users from the ages of about three years to mid-[[teen]]s;{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} past the mid-teens, subjects become so complex (e.g. [[Calculus]]) that teaching via a game is impractical.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Numerous subgenres exist, in fields such as math or typing.\n\n=== Esports ===\n{{main|Esports}}\n[[Esports]] games are [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] games that are usually played competitively at the professional level. These games are often targeted at the \"hardcore\" gaming audience, and are usually [[first-person shooter]] games, requiring twitch-based reaction speed and coordination, or [[real-time strategy]] games, requiring high levels of strategic macro- and micromanagement, or [[MOBA]]s, requiring both.\n\n=== Exergame ===\n{{main|Exergaming}}\nAn [[Exergaming|exergame]] ([[Portmanteau word|portmanteau]] of \"[[exercise]]\" and \"[[video game|game]]\") is a video game that provides exercise. \"Exergames\" sub-divide into two main implementations, those with a game specifically designed to use an exercise input device (for example, the game ''[[Wii Fit]]'' using the [[Wii Balance Board]]) and those implementations using a genre of a game. Games fit into the category of entertainment, and similarly \"exergames\" are a category of \"exertainment\" (formed from \"[[exercise]]\" and \"[[entertainment]]\"). \"Exertainment\" refers to one aspect of adding entertainment to an exercise workout.\n\n=== Personalized game ===\n{{main|Personalized video game}}\n[[Personalized video game|Personalized games]] are created for one specific player or a group of players usually as a gift. They are hand-made to feature real names, places and events from the recipient's life. Usual occasions for such games are birthdays, anniversaries, and engagement proposals.\n\n=== Serious game ===\n{{main|Serious game}}\n[[Serious game]]s are intended to educate or train the player. These games tend to promote \"education, science, social change, health care or even the military.\"<ref name=serious>{{cite web |accessdate=2009-01-23 |url=http://www.cnet.com.au/games/0,239029232,240061367,00.htm |title=What's wrong with serious games? |publisher=CNET |date=2006-03-23 |author=Terdiman, Daniel |authorlink=Daniel Terdiman |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080323102029/http://www.cnet.com.au/games/0,239029232,240061367,00.htm |archive-date=March 23, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Some of these games have no specific ending or goal in the game. Rather, the player learns a real life lesson from the game. For example, games from [[website]]s such as Newsgaming.com and gamesforchange.org raise political issues using the distinct properties of games.\n\n== Scientific studies ==\n\nAs video games are increasingly the subject of scientific studies, game genres are themselves becoming a subject of study.\n\nAn early attempt at analysis of the action and adventure genres appeared in a Game Developers Conference 2000 paper 'Mostly Armless: Grabbing the 3D World'. This critiqued a variety of adventure and action games to categorize gameplay and interaction for adventure, action, and hybrid genres. It provided a graph of the genres along the axes of 'immediacy' vs 'complexity', with an 'ideal-zone' for gameplay that covered and linked adventure and action games. It detailed various interaction styles present in these genres and extrapolated to future user interface and gameplay possibilities for these and other genres. Some of these have since been adopted by persistent worlds. For example, [[Second life|Second Life]] uses some of the gameplay investment and interface elements described in section 4 of the paper.<ref>{{cite web|date=July 2000 |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/gdcarchive/2000/index.htm |title=GDC '00: Mostly Armless: Grabbing the 3D World |author=Rees, David |work=Gamasutra |accessdate=2010-06-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029005902/http://www.gamasutra.com/gdcarchive/2000/index.htm |archivedate=October 29, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIn a [[University of Queensland]] study, game enjoyment was correlated with attributes such as immersion, social interaction, and the nature of the goals.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sweetser|first=Penelope|author2=Wyeth, P. |title=GameFlow: a model for evaluating player enjoyment in games|journal=[[Computers in Entertainment]]|volume=3|year=2005|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1077253|issue=3|doi=10.1145/1077246.1077253|pages=3}}</ref> These may be underlying factors in differentiating game genres.\n\nStatistical scaling techniques were used in a study presented at the 2007 Siggraph Video Game Symposium to convert subject ratings of game similarity into visual maps of game genres.

Video game genres are not usually defined by the [[Setting (narrative)|setting]] or [[Narrative|story]] of the game or its medium of play, but by the way the player interacts with the game.<ref name=\"adams2013-c3s1\">{{harvnb|Adams|2013|loc=ch. 3 \u00a7 1}}.</ref> For example; a [[first-person shooter]] is still a first-person shooter regardless of whether it takes place in a [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]], or [[Military fiction|military]] setting; so long as it features a camera mimicking the perspective of the protagonist ([[First-person (gaming)|first-person]]) and gameplay centered around the use of [[ranged weapon]]ry.\n\nGenres may encompass a wide variety of games, leading to even more specific classifications called ''subgenres''. For example, an [[action game]] can be classified into many subgenres such as [[platform game]]s and [[fighting game]]s. Some games, most notably [[browser game|browser]] and [[mobile game|mobile]] games, are commonly classified into multiple genres.<ref name=\"adams2013-c3s1\" /><ref name=\"adams2013-c3s2\">{{harvnb|Adams|2013|loc=ch. 3 \u00a7 2}}.</ref>\n\nThe following is a list of all commonly defined video game genres, with short descriptions for individual genres and major subgenres.\n\n== Action ==\n{{Main|Action game}}Action games emphasize physical challenges that require [[Hand-eye coordination|hand-eye coordination]] and [[motor skill]] to overcome. They center around the player, who is in control of most of the action. Most of the earliest video games were considered action games; today, it is still a vast genre covering all games that involve physical challenges.\n\nAction games are classified by many subgenres. [[Platform games]] and [[fighting games]] are among the best-known subgenres, while [[shooter games]] became and continue to be one of the dominant genres in video gaming since the 1990s.<ref name=\"adams2014\">{{harvnb|Adams|2014}}.</ref>{{sfn|Wolf|2012|p=572}} Action games usually involve elements of [[twitch gameplay]].<ref name=\"adams2014\" />\n\n=== Platform games ===\n{{Main|Platform game}}\n[[File:FEZ trial gameplay HD.webm|thumb|Platform games feature vertical environments with leaping and climbing between platforms, hence the name ''platform game''.|205x205px]]\nPlatform games (or ''platformers'') have gameplay primarily centered around jumping and climbing to navigate the character's environment. They may have enemies or obstacles to avoid and fight or may just be pure jumping puzzles. Generally the player's character in a platform game is able to jump many times their own height and player is offered some control over their movement in midair as well as the height and distance of their jumps.<ref name=\"adams2013-c3s2\" /> Settings tend to be vertically exaggerated with lots of uneven terrain that the player can leap to or fall off of.\n\n''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'' was one of the earliest and best-known platformers; the American gaming press classified it using the term ''climbing game'' at the time.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Player's Guide to Climbing Games|journal=Electronic Games|date=January 1983|volume=1|issue=11|page=49|url=https://archive.org/stream/Electronic_Games_Volume_01_Number_11_1983-01_Reese_Communications_US#page/n47/mode/2up|access-date=December 12, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319134356/https://archive.org/stream/Electronic_Games_Volume_01_Number_11_1983-01_Reese_Communications_US#page/n47/mode/2up|archive-date=March 19, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' was one of the best-selling games of all time, with more than 40 million copies sold.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamecubicle.com/features-mario-units_sold_sales.htm |title=Mario Sales Data |access-date=December 12, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/65RQRdS8T?url=http://www.gamecubicle.com/features-mario-units_sold_sales.htm |archive-date=February 14, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== Shooter games ===\n{{main|Shooter game}}\n[[File:Freedoom 0.9 MAP07.png|thumb|This picture shows gameplay of a freely licensed version of ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', a highly influential first-person shooter.|205x205px]]\nIn shooter games (or simply ''shooters''), players use ranged weapons to participate in the action, which takes place at a distance.<ref name=\"adams2013-c3s2\" /> Most shooters involve violent gameplay; lethal weaponry is used to damage opponents. However, some shooters, such as ''[[Splatoon]]'', have non-violent objectives.\n\nShooters, aside from subgenre classifications, can be further classified by their perspective of play. [[First-person shooter]]s are played within the [[protagonist]]'s perspective; they often include a heads-up display displaying key information such as the current [[Health (gaming)|health]] of the protagonist.{{sfn|Call|Whitlock|Voorhees|2012|p=5}}<ref name=\"adams2015p39\">{{harvnb|Adams|2015|p=39}}.</ref> In [[third-person shooter]]s, the protagonist's body can be seen fully; the environment is rendered from a distance.<ref name=\"adams2015p39\" /> Some shooters incorporate both perspectives.<ref name=\"adams2013-c3s2\" />\n\n[[Hero shooter]]s are either first- or third-person multiplayer shooters that strongly encourage [[Cooperative gameplay|cooperative play]] between players on a single team through the use of pre-designed hero characters that each possess unique attributes, skills, weapons, and other passive and active abilities. While setting up a match, players on a team typically must each select a hero who is different from those selected by teammates and, as the match progresses, the players gain experience to unlock more powerful abilities for their hero. Outside of a match, players have the ability to customize the appearance of the heroes but with no other in-game effects. Hero shooters are inspired by the [[multiplayer online battle arena]] genre, and popular team-based shooters like ''[[Team Fortress 2]]''. Examples of hero shooters include ''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]'', ''[[Paladins (video game)|Paladins]]'', and ''[[Apex Legends]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/271933/Hero_Shooters_Charting_the_rebirth_of_a_genre.php|title=Hero Shooters: Charting the (re)birth of a genre|last=Wawro|first=Alex|date=May 6, 2016|work=[[Gamasutra]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507142751/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/271933/Hero_Shooters_Charting_the_rebirth_of_a_genre.php|archive-date=May 7, 2016|accessdate=May 6, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thegamer.com/overwatch-2-hero-shooter/|title=Overwatch 2 And The Future Of The Hero Shooter|date=2019-07-26|website=TheGamer|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref>\n\n[[Light gun shooter]]s are controlled with a gun-shaped controller; light guns function via a light sensor, hence the name \"light gun\".

Most fighting games feature a large number of playable characters and a competitive multiplayer mode. While most fighting games emphasize hand-to-hand combat,<ref name=\"adams2013-c3s2\" /> some fighting games such as ''[[Soulcalibur]]'' and ''[[Samurai Shodown]]'' center around combat with melee weapons. Many fighting games incorporate heavily emphasized attacks based on various [[martial arts]] systems. Fighting games were one of the dominant genres in video gaming until the late-1990s, where the genre saw a slight decline. This decline was short lived however, for titles such as ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'', ''[[Street Fighter]]'', and ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' dominate the fighter demographic of the modern era.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dunn|first1=Jeff|title=Of Fists and Fatalities: The history of fighting games|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/fists-and-fatalities-history-fighting-games/|website=Gamesradar|accessdate=November 14, 2015|date=2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222211857/http://www.gamesradar.com/fists-and-fatalities-history-fighting-games/|archive-date=December 22, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Different sub-genre games are starting to become more popular though.

While they both involve close-range combat, beat 'em ups put players against large waves of opponents as opposed to a few.<ref name=\"adams2013-c3s2\" /><ref name=\"rogers2014\" /> Beat 'em ups often incorporate mechanics from other action genres and multiplayer in beat 'em up games tends to be [[Cooperative gameplay|co-operative]] rather than competitive. Beat 'em ups saw a sudden decline in popularity in the early 1990s with the release of fighting games, but 3D beat 'em ups have kept the genre alive.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Spencer|first1=Spanner|title=The Tao of Beat-'em-ups \u2022 Page 3|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/a_taoofbeatemups_pt2_retro?page=3|website=Eurogamer|accessdate=November 14, 2015|date=2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925150533/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/a_taoofbeatemups_pt2_retro?page=3|archive-date=September 25, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Hack and Slash]] is a sub-genre often used to refer to weapons based beat 'em ups.\n\n=== Stealth game ===\n{{main|Stealth game}}\nThese games tend to emphasize sneaking around and avoiding enemy notice over direct conflict, for example, the ''[[Metal Gear]]'' series, and the ''[[Sly Cooper]]'' series. In a Stealth game, players are usually still able to engage in loud, conspicuous combat, but are often punished for it. Other games, such as ''[[Dishonored]]'', the player can obtain their goal with or without stealth, but stealth is encouraged as the player is at a disadvantage over many of their enemies. The inclusion of stealth as a mechanic in a game does not necessarily make it a Stealth Game. For example, ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim|Skyrim]]'' has an entire perk tree dedicated to \"Sneaking\", but there are few opportunities to use it effectively until the player invests dozens of perks into it, and most of the dungeons in the game are set up in favor of the hack-and-slash strategy that most players adopt.{{original research inline|date=October 2017}}\n\nThe first stealth game was ''Manbiki Shounen'' (''Shoplifting Boy''), published in November 1979.<ref>{{cite book |last=Szczepaniak |first=John |year=2014 |title=The Untold History of Japanese Game Developers |publisher=SMG Szczepaniak |volume=1 |page=7 |isbn=978-0-9929260-3-8 |quote=First ever stealth game, ''Manbiki Shounen''}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/japandvd/japandvd.htm|title=The Untold History of Japanese Game Developers BOOK|website=Hardcore Gaming 101|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160908102842/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/japandvd/japandvd.htm|archivedate=2016-09-08}}</ref> The [[PET 2001]] [[personal computer game]] was developed by Hiroshi Suzuki.<ref>{{cite book |last=Szczepaniak |first=John |year=2014 |title=The Untold History of Japanese Game Developers |publisher=SMG Szczepaniak |volume=1 |pages=604\u2013605 |isbn=978-0-9929260-3-8 |quote=SUZUKI, Hiroshi ...

Many are set in procedurally-generated environments, and are open-ended with no set goals. They may overlap with the [[survival horror]] genre, in which the player must survive within a supernatural setting, such as a zombie apocalypse.\n\n=== Battle Royale ===\n{{main|Battle royale game}}\nA battle royale game is a genre that blends the survival, exploration and scavenging elements of a [[survival game]] with [[Last man standing (gaming)|last man standing]] gameplay. Battle royale games challenge a large number of players, starting with minimal equipment, to search for weapons and armor and eliminate other opponents, while trying to stay in safe playable area which shrinks as the time passes, with the winner being the last competitor in the game. Notable battle royale games include ''[[PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds]]'', ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'', and ''[[Apex Legends]]''.\n\n=== Rhythm games ===\n{{main|Rhythm game}}\n[[File:Fretsonfire4.png|thumb|230x230px|''[[Frets on Fire]]'' is a music game.|alt=]]\n'''Rhythm game'''&nbsp;or&nbsp;'''rhythm action'''&nbsp;is a&nbsp;genre&nbsp;of&nbsp;[[Music video game|music-themed]]&nbsp;[[Action game|action video game]]&nbsp;that challenges a player's sense of rhythm.&nbsp;The genre includes dance games such as&nbsp;''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]''&nbsp;and music-based games such as&nbsp;''[[Donkey Konga]]''&nbsp;and&nbsp;''[[Guitar Hero]]''. Games in the genre challenge the player to press buttons at precise times: the screen shows which button the player is required to press, and the game awards points both for accuracy and for synchronization with the beat.\n\n''[[PaRappa the Rapper]]''&nbsp;has been deemed the first influential rhythm game; whose basic template formed the core of subsequent games in the genre. Other popular rhythm games include ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]'', [[Maimai (video game)|''Maimai'']], [[Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA|''Project Diva'']], ''[[Cytus]]'', [[Love Live! School Idol Festival|''Love Live: School Idol Festival'']], [[The Idolmaster]], ''[[osu!]]'', ''[[Taiko no Tatsujin]]'', ''[[Crypt of the Necrodancer]]'', ''[[Rhythm Heaven]]'', etc.\n\n== Action-adventure ==\n{{main|Action-adventure game}}\n\n[[Action-adventure game]]s combine elements of their two component genres, typically featuring long-term obstacles that must be overcome using a tool or item as leverage (which is collected earlier), as well as many smaller obstacles almost constantly in the way, that require elements of action games to overcome. Action-adventure games tend to focus on exploration and usually involve item gathering, simple puzzle solving, and combat. \"Action-adventure\" has become a label which is sometimes attached to games which do not fit neatly into another well known genre. Because of their prevalence on [[video game console]]s and the absence of typical [[adventure game]]s, action-adventure games are often called \"adventure games\" by modern gamers.\n\nOne of the first action-adventure games was the [[Atari 2600]] game ''[[Adventure (Atari 2600)|Adventure]]'' (1980). It was directly inspired by the original [[text adventure]], ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure]]''. In the process of adapting a text game to a console with only a joystick for control, designer [[Warren Robinett]] created an action-adventure game by incorporating action [[arcade game]] elements.\n\nThe action-adventure later became an established genre with [[Shigeru Miyamoto]]'s ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' (1986), which became a success due to how it combined elements from different genres to create a compelling hybrid, including exploration, [[transport puzzle]]s, adventure-style inventory [[Puzzle game|puzzles]], an action component, a monetary system, and simplified RPG-style level building without the [[experience points]].<ref>{{Cite web |author=Travis Fahs |url=http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/939/939361p1.html |title=IGN Presents the History of Zelda - Retro Feature at IGN |publisher=Uk.retro.ign.com |date=2010-08-27 |accessdate=2011-01-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120602072944/http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/939/939361p1.html |archive-date=June 2, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> The game was also an early example of [[open world]], [[non-linear]] gameplay, and introduced innovations like [[Save file|saving]] on battery backup.

One crucial [[gameplay]] element in many of these games is the low quantity of ammunition, or number of breakable [[melee weapons]]. Notable examples include ''[[Silent Hill]]'' and ''[[Resident Evil]]''.\n\n''[[Nostromo]]'' was the first survival horror game, developed by Akira Takiguchi, a [[Tokyo University]] student and [[Taito]] contractor, for the [[PET 2001]]. It was ported to the [[PC-6001]] by Masakuni Mitsuhashi (also known as Hiromi Ohba, later joined [[Game Arts]]), and published by [[ASCII Corporation|ASCII]] in 1981, exclusively for Japan.<ref>{{cite book |last=Szczepaniak |first=John |year=2014 |title=The Untold History of Japanese Game Developers |publisher=SMG Szczepaniak |volume=1 |pages=544\u2013573 |isbn=978-0-9929260-3-8 }}</ref>\n\n=== Metroidvania ===\n[[Metroidvania]] games are a subgenre of Platformer (named after its two first well-known franchises, ''[[Metroid]]'' and ''[[Castlevania]]'') that feature large interconnected world maps the player can explore, but access to parts of the world is limited by doors or other obstacles that can only be opened after the player has acquired special tools, weapons or abilities within the game. Acquiring such improvements also aids the player in defeating more difficult enemies and locating shortcuts and secret areas, and often includes retracing one's steps across the map. Metroidvanias usually do not consist of any linear gameplay and often involve lots of backtracking - especially after new powerups or tools have been obtained. Bossfights are also a staple of metroidvanias, without which they would be considered puzzle or adventure games {{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}.\n\n== Adventure ==\n{{main|Adventure game}}\n\n[[Adventure game]]s were some of the earliest games created, beginning with the text adventure ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure]]'' in the 1970s. That game was originally titled simply \"Adventure,\" and is the namesake of the genre. Over time, graphics have been introduced to the genre and the interface has evolved.\n\nUnlike adventure films, adventure games are not defined by story or content. Rather, adventure describes a manner of gameplay without reflex challenges or action. They normally require the player to solve various puzzles by interacting with people or the environment, most often in a non-confrontational way. It is considered a \"purist\" genre and tends to exclude anything which includes action elements beyond a [[mini game]].\n\nBecause they put little pressure on the player in the form of action-based challenges or time constraints, adventure games have had the unique ability to appeal to people who do not normally play video games. The genre peaked in popularity with the 1993 release of ''[[Myst]]'', the best-selling PC game of all time up to that point.<ref name=\"best-selling\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/simslivinlarge/news_2857556.html |title=The Sims overtakes Myst |accessdate=2008-03-17 |author=Walker, Trey |date=2002-03-22 |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5mVievash?url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/simslivinlarge/news_2857556.html |archive-date=January 3, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> The simple point and click interface, detailed worlds and casual pace made it accessible, and its sense of artistic surrealism caused news outlets such as ''[[Wired Magazine]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', and the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' to declare that the gaming industry had matured.<ref>{{cite web|author=Rothstein, Edward|date=1994-12-04|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F07E7DD1030F937A35751C1A962958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1|title=A New Art Form May Arise From the 'Myst'|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2008-03-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115195423/http://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/04/arts/a-new-art-form-may-arise-from-the-myst.html|archive-date=January 15, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Evenson, Laura|publisher=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|title=Interactive CD-ROMs come of age|date=1994-12-22|page=DAT36}}</ref> It had four proper sequels, but none managed to experience the same level of success. The success of ''Myst'' also inspired many others to create similar games with first person perspectives, surreal environments and minimal or no dialogue, but these neither recaptured the success of ''Myst'' nor of earlier personality-driven adventures.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nIn the late 1990s the genre suffered a large drop in popularity, mass-market releases became rare, and many proclaimed the adventure game to be dead. More accurately, it has become a niche genre. Adventure games are not entirely uncommon, but they tend to be very low budget in anticipation of modest sales. The genre was somewhat rejuvenated with the release of ''[[The Longest Journey]]'' in 1999, which emphasized stronger story elements and more interaction with different characters. A recent resurgence of adventure games on Nintendo consoles might signify a new interest in the genre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20070205/nixon_01.shtml|title=Bring Out Your Dead!

The game produced as a result was mired in controversy and production delays, and to some, signalled the true end of the genre outside of niche markets.\n\n=== Text adventures ===\n\nThe earliest adventure games were text adventures, also known as [[interactive fiction]]. Games such as the popular ''[[Zork]]'' series of the late 1970s and early 1980s allowed the player to use a keyboard to enter commands such as \"get rope\" or \"go west\" while the computer describes what is happening. A great deal of programming went into [[text parser|parsing]] the player's text input.\n\n=== Graphic adventures ===\n\n[[File:Mystery House - Apple II render emulation - 2.png|thumb|250px|right|''[[Mystery House]]'' for the [[Apple II family|Apple II]] was the first adventure game to use graphics in the early [[home computer]] era.]]\n[[Graphic adventure game]]s emerged as graphics became more common. Adventure games began to supplement and later on replace textual descriptions with visuals (for example, a picture of the current location). Early graphic adventure games used text-parsers to input commands. The growing use of [[computer mouse|mice]] led to the \"[[point-and-click]]\" genre of adventure games, where the player would no longer have to type commands. The player could, for example, click on a hand [[icon (computing)|icon]] and then on a rope to pick up the rope.\n\n=== Visual novels ===\n{{main|visual novel}}\n\nA {{Nihongo|[[visual novel]]|\u30d3\u30b8\u30e5\u30a2\u30eb\u30ce\u30d9\u30eb|bijuaru noberu}} is a game featuring mostly static graphics, usually with [[anime]]-style art. As the name might suggest, they resemble mixed-media novels or [[tableau vivant]] stage plays. Many visual novels track statistics that the player must build in order to advance the plot, and permit a variety of endings, allowing more dynamic reactions to the player's actions than a typical linear adventure plot. Many visual novels are dating sims, including [[bish\u014djo game]]s. Visual novels are especially prevalent in [[Japan]], where they make up nearly 70% of PC games released.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=2009-01-23 |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/pressrelease.php?id=1510 |title=AMN and Anime Advanced Announce Anime Game Demo Downloads |publisher=Anime News Network |date=2006-02-08}}</ref> They are rarely produced for video game consoles, but the more popular games are sometimes [[Porting|ported]] to systems such as the [[Dreamcast]] or the [[PlayStation 2]]. The market for visual novels outside Japan, however, was nearly non-existent prior to the success of the [[Nintendo DS]], for which several Japanese visual novels were released in the West, such as the ''[[Ace Attorney]]'' series.\n\n=== Interactive movie ===\n\nThe [[interactive movie]] genre came about with the invention of [[laserdisc]]s. An interactive movie contains pre-filmed [[full motion video|full-motion]] [[cartoon]]s or live-action sequences, where the player controls some of the moves of the main character. For example, when in danger, the player decides which move, action, or combination to choose. In these games, the only activity the player has is to choose or guess the move the [[game designer|designers]] intend him to make. Interactive movies usually differ from games that simply use [[Full motion video based game|full motion video]], FMV, extensively between scenes in that they try to integrate it into the gameplay itself. This has been used in everything from racing games to fighting games. A few adventure game have tried to use the term to liken the storytelling of their games to those in movies, most notably the later ''[[Tex Murphy]]'' games and the more recent ''[[Fahrenheit (2005 video game)|Fahrenheit (Indigo Prophecy)]]'',<ref name=\"1up\">{{cite web|accessdate=2009-01-23 |url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=0&cId=3143998 |title=Indigo Prophecy\u2013Developer's Diary |publisher=1UP |date=2005-09-22 |author=Cage, David |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513025716/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=0&cId=3143998 |archivedate=2013-05-13 }}</ref> although they are more aptly classified as genre hybrids. Elements of interactive movies have been adapted for game [[cut scene]]s, in the form of [[Quick Time Event]]s, to keep the player alert. Games like ''[[Resident Evil 4]]'' present obvious in-game prompts for the player to react to. Not doing so usually results in the player character either getting hurt or outright killed.\n\n=== Real-time 3D adventures ===\n\nAround this time, real-time 3D adventure games appeared. These included ''[[Nightfall (video game)|Nightfall]]'' in 1998, ''[[Shenmue]]'' in 1999, ''[[Myst|realMyst]]'' in 2000, ''[[Shadow of Memories]]'' in 2001, and ''[[Uru: Ages Beyond Myst]]'' in 2003. They augmented traditional adventure gameplay with some of the attributes more commonly associated with action games. For example, freedom of motion and physics-based behavior.\n\n== Role-playing ==\n{{main|Role-playing video game}}\n{{see also|History of role-playing video games}}\n[[File:KQ-hitpoints.png|thumb|right|''KQ'' is a role-playing game]]\n\n[[Role-playing video game]]s draw their gameplay from traditional [not always] [[role-playing game]]s like ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''. Most of these games cast the player in the role of one or more \"adventurers\" who specialize in specific skill sets (such as melee combat or ranged [[Magic (gaming)|magic]] spells) while progressing through a predetermined storyline. Many involve manoeuvring these character(s) through an [[overworld]], usually populated with monsters, that allows access to more important game locations, such as towns, dungeons, and castles. Since the emergence of affordable [[home computer]]s coincided with the popularity of [[paper and pencil game|paper and pencil]] role-playing games, this genre was one of the first in video games and continues to be popular today. Gameplay elements strongly associated with RPG, such as statistical character development through the acquisition of [[experience point]]s, have been widely adapted to other genres such as [[action-adventure game]]s. Though nearly all of the early entries in the genre were [[turn-based game]]s, many modern role-playing games progress in real-time. Thus, the genre has followed the [[strategy game]]'s trend of moving from turn-based to real-time combat. The move to real-time combat began with the release of [[Square (video game company)|Square]]'s (now [[Square Enix]]'s) ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]'', the first game to use the [[Final Fantasy battle systems#Active Time Battle|Active Time Battle]] system; this was quickly followed by truly real-time action role-playing games such as the [[Mana (series)|''Mana'' series]], ''[[Soul Blazer]]'' and ''[[Ultima VII]]''. Although older turn-based system still exist, such as the [[Golden Sun (series)|''Golden Sun'']] series for [[Game Boy Advance]] as well as ''[[Pok\u00e9mon]]''.\n\n=== Action RPG ===\n[[File:Freedroidrpg basic gameplay.ogv|thumb|left|Video showing basic point and click action RPG gameplay.]]\nThe [[action role-playing game]] or action RPG is a type of [[role-playing video game]] which incorporates real-time combat as opposed to turn-based or menu-based, often borrowing elements from [[action game]]s or [[action-adventure game]]s. Some of the first action role-playing games were produced by [[Nihon Falcom]] in the 1980s, such as the [[Dragon Slayer (series)|''Dragon Slayer'' series]] and [[Ys (video game series)|''Ys'' series]]. Later so-called \"''[[Diablo (video game)|Diablo]]'' clones\" are also part of this genre. Although the precise definition of the genre varies, the typical action RPG features a heavy emphasis on combat, often simplifying or removing non-combat attributes and statistics and the effect they have on the character's development.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rpgdot.com/index.php?hsaction=10053&ID=1007 |title=The Action RPG Revolution |accessdate=2007-03-02 |last=Turner |first=Brian |date=2004-07-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051101204302/http://www.rpgdot.com/index.php?hsaction=10053&ID=1007 |archivedate=November 1, 2005 }}</ref> Additionally, combat always takes place using a real-time system (hence the \"action\") that relies on the player's ability to perform particular actions with speed and accuracy to determine success, rather than mainly using the player character's attributes to determine this.\n\n=== MMORPG ===\n[[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]s, or MMORPG, emerged in the mid to late 1990s as a commercial, [[graphical game|graphical]] variant of text-based [[MUD]]s, which had existed since 1978. By and large, MMORPG feature the usual RPG objectives of completing quests and strengthening one's [[player character]], but involve up to hundreds of players interacting with each other on the same persistent world in real-time. The massively multiplayer concept was quickly combined with other genres. Fantasy MMORPG, like ''[[Final Fantasy XI]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar]]'', and ''[[The Elder Scrolls Online]]'', remain the most popular type of MMOG, with the most popular \"pay-to-play\" game being ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', and the most popular \"[[free-to-play]]\" games including ''[[RuneScape]]'' and ''[[TERA (video game)|TERA]]'', yet other types of MMORPG are appearing. Sci-fi MMORPG like ''[[Phantasy Star Online]]'' hold a smaller part of the market, with the popular space sci-fi game ''[[EVE Online]]'' being the most notable. Other massively multiplayer online games which do not have a conventional RPG setting include [[Second Life]] and [[Ingress (game)|Ingress]].\n\n=== Roguelikes ===\n[[File:Nethack screenshot.png|thumbnail|left|''[[NetHack]]'' is a roguelike game.  The text display seen here is common in games in the roguelike genre.]]\nThe [[roguelike]] video game subgenre borrows its name and gameplay elements from the 1980 computer game ''[[Rogue (computer game)|Rogue]]''. Superficially, a roguelike is a two-dimensional [[dungeon crawl]] with a high degree of randomness and an emphasis on statistical character development. Though traditionally featuring a text user interface, many such games utilize graphic tiles to overcome character set limitations.\n\n=== Tactical RPG ===\nThe [[tactical role-playing game]] subgenre principally refers to games which incorporate gameplay from [[strategy video game|strategy games]] as an alternative to traditional RPG systems.<ref name=\"EATRPG\">{{cite web |accessdate=2009-01-23 |url=http://www.ea.com/official/lordoftherings/tactics/us/whatis.jsp |title=What is Tactics? |publisher=Electronic Arts |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925180218/http://www.ea.com/official/lordoftherings/tactics/us/whatis.jsp |archive-date=September 25, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> Like standard RPG, the player controls a finite party and battles a similar number of enemies, but this genre incorporates strategic gameplay such as tactical movement on an isometric grid.<ref name=\"EATRPG\"/> The genre has its origins in [[tabletop role-playing game]]s, where each player has time to decide his or her characters' actions.\n\n=== Sandbox RPG ===\nSandbox RPG or [[Open world|Open World RPG]] allow the player a large amount of freedom and usually contain a somewhat more open free-roaming (meaning the player is not confined to a single path restricted by rocks or fences etc.) world. Sandbox RPGs contain similarities to other sandbox games such as the [[Grand Theft Auto]] series, with a large number of interactable non-player characters, large amount of content and typically some of the largest worlds to explore and longest playtimes of all RPG due to an impressive amount of secondary content not critical to the game's main storyline. Sandbox RPG often attempt to emulate an entire region of their setting. Popular examples of this subgenre include the ''[[Dragon Slayer (series)|Dragon Slayer]]'' series by [[Nihon Falcom]], the early ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' games by [[Chunsoft]], ''[[Zelda II]]'' by [[Nintendo]], ''[[Wasteland (video game)|Wasteland]]'' by [[Interplay Entertainment]], the ''[[SaGa (series)|SaGa]]'' and ''[[Mana (series)|Mana]]'' series by [[Squaresoft]], ''[[System Shock 2]]'' by [[Irrational Games]] and [[Looking Glass Studios]], ''[[Deus Ex (video game)|Deus Ex]]'' by [[Ion Storm]], ''[[The Elder Scrolls]]'' and [[Fallout series|''Fallout'' series]] by [[Bethesda Softworks]] and [[Interplay Entertainment]], ''[[Fable (2004 video game)|Fable]]'' by [[Lionhead Studios]], the [[Gothic series|''Gothic'' series]] by [[Piranha Bytes]], and the ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles]]'' series by [[Monolith Soft]].\n\n===JRPG===\nA role-playing game made in Japan but has since encapsulated a new kind of game not just made in Japan. Some games include ''[[Chrono Trigger]]'' for the SNES, ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'', and many more.\n\n===First-person party-based RPG===\n[[File:DOTGv0.31screenshot.png|thumb|right|Screenshot of ''Damnation of Gods'', a ''Dungeon Master'' clone. All four members of the players's party move around the game world as a single unit in first-person perspective.]]\nAlso known as DRPG (Dungeon RPG), this subgenre consists of RPGs where the player leads a party of adventurers in [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]] through a dungeon or labyrinth, typically in a grid-based environment. Examples include the aforementioned ''Wizardry'', ''Might and Magic'' and ''Bard's Tale'' series; as well as the ''[[Etrian Odyssey (series)|Etrian Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Elminage]]'' series. Games of this type are also known as \"blobbers\", since the player moves the entire party around the playing field as a single unit, or \"blob\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/12/05/the-rpgs-of-2017/ |title=The RPGs of 2017 |last=Cobbett |first=Richard |date=December 5, 2016 |website=Rock, Paper, Shotgun |publisher=Rock, Paper, Shotgun |access-date=2017-05-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170415020146/https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/12/05/the-rpgs-of-2017/ |archive-date=April 15, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/FelipePepe/20150625/244262/CRPG_History_Abridged__21_RPGs_that_brought_something_new_to_the_table.php |title=CRPG History Abridged - 21 RPGs that brought something new to the table |last=Pepe |first=Felipe |date=June 25, 2015 |website=Gamasutra |publisher=UBM |access-date=2017-05-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170524090937/http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/FelipePepe/20150625/244262/CRPG_History_Abridged__21_RPGs_that_brought_something_new_to_the_table.php |archive-date=May 24, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nMost \"blobbers\" are turn-based, but some titles such as the ''Dungeon Master'', ''[[Legend of Grimrock]]'', and ''[[Eye of the Beholder (video game)|Eye of the Beholder]]'' series are played in real-time. Early games in this genre lack an [[automap]] feature, forcing players to draw their own maps in order to keep track of their progress. Environmental and spatial puzzles are common, meaning players may have to, for instance, move a stone in one part of the level in order to open a gate in another part of the level.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n== Simulation ==\n{{main|Simulation video game}}\n\n[[Simulation video game]]s is a diverse super-category of games, generally designed to closely simulate aspects of a real or fictional reality.\n\n=== Construction and management simulation ===\n{{main|Construction and management simulation}}\n[[File:Lincity-ng.png|thumb|A sample city from ''[[Lincity|Lincity NG]]'']]\n[[Construction and management simulation]]s (or CMS) are a type of simulation game which task players to build, expand or manage fictional communities or projects with limited resources.\n\nIn [[city-building game]]s the player acts as overall planner or leader to meet the needs and wants of game characters by initiating structures for food, shelter, health, spiritual care, economic growth, etc. Success is achieved when the city budget makes a growing profit and citizens experience an upgraded lifestyle in housing, health, and goods. While military development is often included, the emphasis is on economic strength. Perhaps the most known game of this type is ''[[SimCity]]'', which is still popular and has had great influence on later city-building games. ''SimCity'', however, also belongs to the ''God Games'' genre since it gives the player god-like abilities in manipulating the world. [[Caesar (video game)|Caesar]] was a long-running series in this genre, with the original game spawning three sequels.\n\n[[Business simulation game]]s generally attempt to simulate an economy or business, with the player controlling the economy of the game.\n\nA [[government simulation game]] (or \"political game\") involves the simulation of the policies, government or politics of a country, but typically excludes warfare. Recently, these types of games have gained the moniker \"[[serious game]]\".\n\n=== Life simulation ===\n{{main|Life simulation game}}\n\n[[Life simulation game]]s (or artificial life games) involve living or controlling one or more artificial lives. A life simulation game can revolve around individuals and relationships, or it could be a simulation of an ecosystem.\n\nBiological simulations may allow the player to experiment with [[genetics]], [[wikt:survival|survival]] or [[ecosystem]]s, often in the form of an [[Serious game|educational package]]. An early example is ''[[SimLife]]'', while relatively recent ones are ''[[Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis]]'' and ''[[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]]''. In other educational simulations such as ''[[Wolf (game)|Wolf]]'', the player \"lives the life\" of an individual animal in a relatively realistic way. Hailed as one of the greatest life simulation games, however, is Creatures, Creatures 2, Creatures 3, where the player breeds generations of a species in a hugely detailed ecosystem.\n\nUnlike other genres of games, [[god game]]s often do not have a set goal that allows a player to win the game. The focus of a god game tends to be control over the lives of people, anywhere from micromanaging a family to overseeing the rise of a civilization.\n\n[[Pet-raising simulation]]s (or [[digital pet]]s) focus more on the relationship between the player and one or few life forms. They are often more limited in scope than other biological simulations. This includes popular examples of [[virtual pets]] such as ''[[Tamagotchi]]'', the ''[[Petz]]'' series, and ''[[Nintendogs]]''.\n\n[[Social simulation game]]s base their gameplay on the [[social interaction]] between multiple artificial lives. The most famous example from this genre is Will Wright's ''[[The Sims]]''. [[Dating sim|Dating sims]] and Romance simulation games fall under this category.\n\n=== Vehicle simulation ===\n{{main|Vehicle simulation game}}\n\n[[Vehicle simulation game]]s are a genre of [[video games]] which attempt to provide the player with a realistic interpretation of operating various kinds of vehicles.<ref name=\"Rollings1\">{{harvnb|Rollings|2003|pp=395\u2013415}}</ref>\n\n[[File:FG-A-10.jpg|thumb|''[[FlightGear]]'' is a flight simulation game.|alt=|230x230px]]\n\nA [[Flight simulation#Flight Simulators at Home|flight simulation]] tasks the player with flying an aircraft, usually an airplane, as realistically as possible. [[Combat flight simulator]]s are the most popular subgenre of simulation. The player controls the plane, not only simulating the act of flying, but also combat situations. There are also civilian flight simulators that do not have the combat aspect.\n\n[[Racing game]]s typically place the player in the driver's seat of a high-performance vehicle and require the player to race against other drivers or sometimes just time. This genre of games is one of the staples of the computer gaming world and many of the earliest computer games created were part of this genre. Emerging in the late 1970s, this genre is still very popular today and continues to push the envelope in terms of graphics and performance. These games \"tend to fall into ''organized racing'' and ''imaginary racing'' categories\". Organized racing simulators attempt to \"reproduce the experience of driving a racing car or motorcycle in an existing racing class: [[Indycar]], [[NASCAR]], [[Formula 1]], and so on.\" On the other hand, imaginary racing games involve \"imaginary situations, driving madly through cities or the countryside or even fantasy environments\". These \"imaginary\" racing games are sometimes called arcade racing games, in contrast to their more realistic \"racing simulation\" counterparts. These include ''[[Need For Speed]]'', ''[[Mario Kart]]'' and ''[[Gran Turismo (series)|Gran Turismo]]''. Rollings and Adams note that \"racing games are often sold in the [[sports game|sports]] category,\" but \"from a [[video game design|design]] standpoint, they really belong in ... vehicle simulations\".<ref name=\"Rollings1\"/>\n\n[[Space flight simulator game]]s are a subgenre that involve piloting a [[spacecraft]]. Space simulators are different from other subgenres, and are not generally considered to be simulators, as their simulated objects do not always exist and often disregard the laws of physics.\n\n[[Train simulator]]s simulate the vehicles, environments and often economics associated with railway transport. These are frequently historical in nature, reminiscing on the evolution and emergence of the railroad in various countries and the economic booms that often accompanied them.\n\n[[Vehicular combat]] or ''car combat'' games focus on fast-paced action, as the player operates a [[car]] or other vehicle and attempts to disable or destroy [[CPU]] or human opponents. Vehicular combat games often allow a player to choose from a variety of potential vehicles, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Vehicular combat was born out of racing/shooter combinations like ''[[Spy Hunter]]'', ''[[RoadBlasters]]'', and ''[[Rock 'N' Roll Racing]]'', but differs in that the players can, if desired, take their vehicles off predefined routes and do battle wherever they please. A subgenre of vehicular combat is ''[[Mecha]]'' combat, where vehicles generally include giant robot-like tanks.\n\n== Strategy ==\n{{main|Strategy video game}}\n\n[[Strategy video game]]s focus on gameplay requiring careful and skillful thinking and planning in order to achieve victory and the action scales from world domination to squad-based tactics. \u201cIn most strategy video games,\u201d says Andrew Rollings, \"the player is given a godlike view of the game world, indirectly controlling the units under his command.\"<ref name=\"Rollings2\">{{harvnb|Rollings|2003|pp=321\u2013345}}</ref> Rollings also notes that \"The origin of strategy games is rooted in their close cousins, board games.\"<ref name=\"Rollings2\"/> Strategy video games generally take one of four archetypal forms, depending on whether the game is '''turn-based or real-time''' and whether the game's focus is upon '''strategy or tactics'''. Real time strategy games are often a multiple unit selection game (multiple game characters can be selected at once to perform different tasks, as opposed to only selecting one character at a time)  with a sky view (view looking down from above) but some recent games such as Tom Clancy's [[EndWar]], are single unit selection and third person view. Like many RPG games, many strategy games are gradually moving away from turn-based systems to more real-time systems.\n\n=== 4X game ===\n{{Main|4X game}}\n[[4X game|4X]] refers to a genre of strategy video game with four primary goals: eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate. A 4X game can be [[turn-based]] or [[real-time strategy|real-time]]. Perhaps the best known example of this genre is [[Sid Meier]]'s ''[[Civilization (computer game)|Civilization]]'' series. 4X games often cover a very large period of time, giving the player the control of an entire civilization or species. Typically these games have a historical setting, encompassing a large amount of human history ([[Empire Earth]], Civilization, Golden Age of Civilizations) or a science fiction setting where the player controls a species set to dominate the galaxy ([[Master of Orion]], [[Galactic Civilizations]]).\n\n=== Artillery game ===\n[[File:Scorched 3D 40.1 screenshot 2.jpg|thumb|220x220px|''[[Scorched 3D]]'' is an artillery game.]]\n{{Main|Artillery game}}\n[[Artillery game|Artillery]] is the generic name for early two or three-player (usually [[turn-based]]) computer games involving [[tank]]s fighting each other in combat or similar derivative games. Artillery games were among the earliest computer games developed and can be considered an extension of the original use of computers, which were once used for military-based calculations such as plotting the trajectories of rockets. Artillery games are considered a type of [[turn-based tactics]] game, though they have also been described as a type of \"shooting game.\" Examples of this genre are ''[[Pocket Tanks]]'', ''[[Hogs of War]]'', ''[[Scorched 3D]]'' and the ''[[Worms (series)|Worms]]'' series.\n\n=== {{anchor|Auto battler}}Auto battler (Auto chess) ===\n{{Main|Auto battler}}\n[[Auto battler]], also known as \"auto chess\", is a type of strategy game that features [[chess]]-like elements where players place characters on a grid-shaped battlefield during a preparation phase, who then fight the opposing team's characters without any further direct input from the player.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/08/01/what-is-an-auto-battler/|title=Spawn Point: What on earth is an auto battler?|last1=Cox|first1=Matt|website=Rock, Paper, Shotgun|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190803125851/https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/08/01/what-is-an-auto-battler/|archive-date=August 3, 2019|accessdate=3 August 2019}}</ref> It was created and popularized by ''[[Dota Auto Chess]]'' in early 2019, and saw more games in the genre by other studios, such as ''[[Teamfight Tactics]]'', ''[[Dota Underlords]]'', and ''[[Hearthstone Battlegrounds]]'' releasing soon after.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/07/04/a-guide-to-auto-chess-tft-league-of-legends-teamfight-tactics-dota-underlords|title=An Introduction to Auto Chess, Teamfight Tactics and Dota Underlords|last1=Gilroy|first1=Joab|website=IGN|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190704045655/https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/07/04/a-guide-to-auto-chess-tft-league-of-legends-teamfight-tactics-dota-underlords|archive-date=July 4, 2019|accessdate=July 10, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/a-guide-to-auto-chess-2019-s-most-popular-new-game-gen-1835820155|title=A Guide To Auto Chess, 2019\u2019s Most Popular New Game Genre|last1=Grayson|first1=Nathan|website=Kotaku|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190703221157/https://kotaku.com/a-guide-to-auto-chess-2019-s-most-popular-new-game-gen-1835820155|archive-date=July 3, 2019|accessdate=July 21, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/1/20943670/blizzcon-2019-announcement-hearthstone-battlegrounds-auto-chess|title=Blizzard announces Hearthstone Battlegrounds, a new autobattler set in the Warcraft Universe|last=Goslin|first=Austen|date=2019-11-01|website=Polygon|language=en|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref>\n\n=== Multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) ===\n{{Main|Multiplayer online battle arena}}\n[[File:Vainglory Halcyon Fold map.tif|thumb|281x281px|''[[Vainglory (video game)|Vainglory]]'' is a multiplayer online battle arena game designed for smartphones and tablets.|alt=]]\n[[Multiplayer online battle arena]] (MOBA) is a genre of strategy video games that originated as a subgenre of [[real-time strategy]] in which each player controls a single character in a team to compete with another team of players. The objective is to destroy the opposing team's main structure with the assistance of computer-controlled units, which periodically [[Spawning (gaming)|spawn]] in groups at the base and marching down predefined paths (called \"lanes\") toward the enemy base. Every [[player character]] typically has its own diverse kit with unique abilities, design, strengths, and weaknesses. Player characters grow in power over the course of a match and learn new thematic abilities, which contribute to a team's overall strategy. Multiplayer online battle arena games are a fusion of [[real-time strategy games]], [[Role-playing video game|role-playing games]], and [[Action game|action games]], though players usually do not construct either buildings or units.\n\nThe genre gained popularity in the 2010s, with ''[[Defense of the Ancients]]'' mod for ''[[Warcraft III]]'', ''[[League of Legends]]'', ''[[Dota 2]]'', ''[[Heroes of the Storm]]'', and ''[[Smite (video game)|Smite]]'' being popular.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.progamerreview.com/best-moba-games/|title=Best Modern MOBA Games - LoL, Dota 2, HotS & Smite Compared|last=Amstrup|first=Johannes|last2=ersen|date=2017-09-15|website=Pro Gamer Reviews|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-19}}</ref> The genre is also well-represented in [[esports]].\n\n=== Real-time strategy (RTS) ===\n{{Main|Real-time strategy}}\nThe moniker \"[[real-time strategy]]\" (RTS), usually applied only to certain computer strategy games, (however, this genre is probably the most well known of strategy games and is what most websites mean when they say \"strategy games\") indicates that the action in the game is continuous, and players will have to make their decisions and actions within the backdrop of a constantly changing game state. Real-time strategy gameplay is characterised by obtaining resources, building bases, researching technologies and producing units. Blizzard Entertainment's ''[[Starcraft]]'' is a popular RTS played competitively in South Korea and televised to large audiences. Other notable games include the [[Warcraft (series)|''Warcraft'' series]], [[Age of Empires|''Age of Empires'' series]], ''[[Dawn of War]]'', ''[[Command and Conquer]]'', and ''[[Dune II]]'' (essentially the first RTS game). Outside of PCs, very few strategy games are real-time; a few examples are ''[[Battle for Middle-earth II]]'', ''[[Pikmin]]'' and ''[[Halo Wars]]''. Even fewer ones use physical pieces, such as ''[[Icehouse (game)|Icehouse]]''.\n\n=== Real-time tactics (RTT) ===\n{{Main|Real-time tactics}}\n[[Real-time tactics]] (abbreviated RTT<ref name=\"ign-stateoftherts\">{{cite web|url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/700/700747p3.html|title=The State of the RTS|work=[[IGN]]|date=April 7, 2006|accessdate=September 14, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060624224943/http://pc.ign.com/articles/700/700747p3.html|archive-date=June 24, 2006|url-status=live}}(Article at IGN discussing their perception of RTS and related genres as of 2006.

It is also sometimes considered a subgenre of [[real-time strategy]], and thus may in this context exist as an element of gameplay or as a basis for the whole game. It is differentiated from [[real-time strategy]] gameplay by the lack of resource [[micromanagement]] and base or unit building, as well as the greater importance of individual units<ref name=\"ign-stateoftherts\"/><ref name=splanet>{{cite web | title =Point - CounterPoint: Resource Collection vs. Fixed Units | publisher =StrategyPlanet | url =http://www.strategyplanet.com/features/articles/pcp-resources/ | accessdate =2007-11-04 | url-status =dead | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071231194439/http://www.strategyplanet.com/features/articles/pcp-resources/ | archivedate =2007-12-31 }}</ref> and a focus on complex battlefield tactics. Example titles include ''[[Warhammer: Dark Omen]]'', ''[[World In Conflict]]'', the ''[[Close Combat (game)|Close Combat]]'' series, and early [[tactical role-playing game]]s such as ''[[Bokosuka Wars]]'', ''[[Kure Software Koubou|Silver Ghost]]'', and ''First Queen''.\n\n=== Tower defense ===\n{{Main|Tower defense}}\n[[Tower defense]] games have a very simple layout. Usually, computer-controlled monsters called ''creeps'' move along a set path, and the player must place, or \"build\" towers along this path to kill the creeps. In some games, towers are placed along a set path for creeps, while in others towers can interrupt creep movement and change their path. In most tower defense games different towers have different abilities such as poisoning enemies or slowing them down. The player is awarded money for killing creeps, and this money can be used to buy more towers, or buy upgrades for a tower such as increased power or range.\n\n=== Turn-based strategy (TBS) ===\n{{Main|Turn-based strategy}}\n[[File:Battle for wesnoth version 1.12.0 screenshot.jpg|thumb|235x235px|''[[The Battle for Wesnoth]]'' is a turn-based strategy game.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=2009-01-23 |url=http://pc.ign.com/objects/142/14240090.html |title=The Battle for Wesnoth |publisher=IGN |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205044129/http://pc.ign.com/objects/142/14240090.html |archive-date=December 5, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref>]]\nThe term [[turn-based strategy]] (TBS) is usually reserved for certain computer strategy games, to distinguish them from real-time strategy games. A player of a turn-based game is allowed a period of analysis before committing to a game action, and some games allow a certain number of moves or actions to take place in a turn. Like real-time strategy games, this genre can include many strategy games which are not solely turn-based games, and games which may contain other features not related to whether the game is turn-based or not. Examples of this genre are the ''[[Civilization computer game|Civilization]]'', ''[[Heroes of Might and Magic]]'', ''[[Making History (game)|Making History]],'' and ''[[Master of Orion]]''.\n\nSome recent turn-based strategy games feature a different gameplay mechanic, with a simultaneous resolution of the turns, every player preparing their future actions in the planning phase, then letting the game follow the orders given at the same time, causing orders to be interrupted by the opponent(s) actions, changing the gameplay from reacting to the opponent's action into guessing them.\n\n=== Turn-based tactics (TBT) ===\n{{Main|Turn-based tactics}}\nThe gameplay of [[turn-based tactics]] games (TBT) is characterized by the expectation of players to complete their tasks using the combat forces provided to them, and usually by the provision of a realistic (or at least believable) representation of military tactics and operations. Examples of this genre include the ''[[Wars (series)|Wars]]'', ''[[Jagged Alliance]]'' and ''[[X-COM]]'' series, as well as [[tactical role-playing game]]s such as the ''[[Fire Emblem]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics]]''.\n\n=== Wargame ===\n{{Main|Wargame (video games)}}\n[[Wargame (video games)|Wargames]] are a [[subgenre]] of [[strategy video game]]s that emphasize strategic or tactical warfare on a map. Wargames generally take one of four archetypal forms, depending on whether the game is turn-based or real-time and whether the game's focus is upon [[military strategy]] or [[military tactics|tactics]].\n\n=== Grand strategy wargame ===\n{{Main|Grand strategy wargame}}\nA [[grand strategy wargame]] is a [[Wargaming|wargame]] that places focus on [[grand strategy]]: military [[strategy]] at the level of movement and use of an entire [[nation state]] or [[empire]]'s resources.\n\n== Sports ==\nSports are video games that simulate [[sports]]. This opposing team(s) can be controlled by other real life people or artificial intelligence.\n\n=== Racing ===\nOne competes against time or opponents using some means of transportation. Sub-genres include [[Sim racing|racing simulators]] (''[[Gran Turismo (series)|Gran Turismo]]'') and [[kart racing game|kart racing]] (''[[Mario Kart]]'').\n\n=== Sports game ===\n[[Sports game]]s emulate the playing of traditional physical [[sports]]. Some emphasize actually playing the sport, while others emphasize the strategy behind the sport (such as ''[[Championship Manager series|Championship Manager]]''). Others satirize the sport for comic effect (such as ''[[Arch Rivals]]''). One of the best selling series in this genre is the ''[[FIFA (video game series)|FIFA]]'' series. This genre emerged early in the history of video games (e.g., ''[[Pong]]'') and remains popular today.\n\n=== Competitive ===\nGames that have high competitive factor but does not represent any traditional sports or the concept is fictional designed by the developer (e.g. [[Ball Jacks]]).\n\n=== Sports-based fighting ===\n\nSports-based fighting games are titles that fall firmly within the definitions of both the Fighting game and Sports game genre, such as boxing and wrestling video games. As such, they are usually put in their own separate subgenres. Often the fighting is far more realistic than in traditional fighting games (though the amount of realism can greatly vary), and many feature real-world franchises or fighters. Examples of this include the [[Fight Night (EA video game series)|''Fight Night'']], ''[[UFC (video game)|UFC]]'' and ''[[WWE 2K]]'' series.\n\n== Other notable genres ==\n\n=== Board game or card game ===\nMany popular [[board game]]s and [[card game]]s have computer versions. [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] opponents can help improve one's skill at traditional games. [[Computer chess|Chess]], [[Draughts|Checkers]], Othello (also known as [[Reversi]]), and [[Backgammon]] have world class computer programs. [[Mahjong]] and related games are immensely popular in [[China]] and [[Japan]]. [[Go (game)|Go]] is popular in [[East Asia]], though it is notoriously difficult to program a [[Computer Go|computer to play Go]] well. \n\n=== Casual games ===\nCasual games are designed to be easily picked up and put down again, allowing for potentially short bursts of play, such as ''Call of Duty'' and most games on a mobile platform. This genre of gaming is meant to be a short and relaxing pastime, a rest in between other occupations and so is most popular with demographics who have less free time. For this reason the games often have auto-saving and syncing as standard so the games can be minimised, put into sleep or otherwise put down with no loss to the player. Market leaders in this genre are often boldly coloured, designed for intuitive interaction and have a high balance of reward to time to keep people coming back. Designers of these games should add a lot of \"juice\" (sound and motion elements that excite the senses) to make them stand out in a sea of highly similar games.\n\nDue to the aforementioned requirements, many of these games are quite simple to pick up and play without lengthy tutorials. Retaining players involves a lot of careful design of levels, challenges and events.\n\n=== Digital collectible card game ===\nA [[digital collectible card game]] (DCCG) is a computer or video game usually played online that emulates [[Collectible card game|collectible card games]] (CCG), or in many cases, doesn't use card-like images at all, but instead [[Icons (computing)|icons]], [[Avatar (computing)|avatars]] or other symbols to represent game pieces. Originally, DCCGs started out as replications of a CCG's physical counterpart such as ''[[Magic: The Gathering]],'' but many DCCGs have foregone a physical version and exclusively release as a video game, such as with ''[[Hearthstone]]''.\n\n=== Logic game ===\nLogic games require the player to solve [[logic]] puzzles or navigate complex locations such as [[maze]]s. They are well suited to [[Casual game|casual play]], and [[Tile-matching video game|tile-matching puzzle games]] are among the most popular casual games. This genre frequently crosses over with adventure and educational games. ''[[Tetris]]'', labeled a puzzle game, is credited for revolutionizing gaming and popularizing the puzzle genre.\n\n=== MMO ===\n{{Main|Massively multiplayer online game}}\nA [[massively multiplayer online game]] (also called MMO and MMOG) is a [[multiplayer video game]] which is capable of supporting large numbers of players simultaneously. By necessity, they are played on the [[Internet]]. Many games have at least one [[persistent world]], however others just have large numbers of players competing at once in one form or another without any lasting effect to the world at all. These games can be found for most network-capable platforms, including the [[personal computer]], [[video game console]], or [[smartphone]]s and other mobile devices.\n\nMMO games can enable players to cooperate and compete with each other on a large scale, and sometimes to interact meaningfully with people around the world. They include a variety of gameplay types, representing many video game genres, an example is the widely played game ''[[Minecraft]]'' which can be played both as an MMO or a single player game.\n\n===Mobile game===\nMobile games are played on devices like phones and tablets, and are usually easy games for casual gamers.\nGames like ''[[Candy Crush Saga]]'' and ''[[Angry Birds]]'' are mobile games. Some mobile games are ported from consoles or computers,\nlike ''[[Minecraft]]'', ''[[Plants vs Zombies]]'', and ''[[Fortnite]]''. Mobile games are usually made for casual gamers and\ncan be played and completed easily, so they can be played by people of all ages.\n\n=== Party game ===\n[[Party games#Party video games|Party games]] are video games developed specifically for multiplayer games between many players. Normally, party games have a variety of [[mini-game]]s that range between collecting more of a certain item than other players or having the fastest time at something. Such games include the ''[[Mario Party]]'' series, ''[[Crash Bash]]'', and ''[[Rayman Raving Rabbids]]''. Versus multiplayer games are not generally considered to be party games.\n\n=== Programming game ===\nA [[programming game]] is a [[computer game]] where the player has no direct influence on the course of the game. Instead, a [[computer program]] or script is written in some [[domain-specific programming language]] in order to control the actions of the characters (usually [[robot]]s, [[tank]]s or [[bacteria]], which seek to destroy each other). In ''[[SpaceChem]]'', for example, players design circuits used for creating molecules from raw materials. ''[[Final Fantasy XII]]'' also includes some elements of a programming game, as the player creates the AI of his characters, although the player can also choose to directly control the action.\n\n=== Trivia game ===\n[[Trivia]] games are growing in popularity, especially on [[mobile phone]]s where people may only have a few minutes to play the game. In trivia games, the object is to answer questions with the goal of obtaining points. They may be based on real-life trivia game shows such as ''[[Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader?]]'' or ''[[Family Feud]]''.\n\n==Idle gaming==\n{{Main|Incremental game}}\nIn an [[IGN]] article, ''[[Cookie Clicker]]'' is credited as one of the few games to have played a major role in the establishment of the genre of idle gaming.<ref name=\"IGN\">{{cite web |url=http://ca.ign.com/articles/2013/10/10/inside-cookie-clicker-and-the-idle-game-movement |title=Inside Cookie Clicker and the Idle Game Move |last=Davis |first=Justin |publisher=IGN |date=October 10, 2013 |accessdate=April 2, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630202207/http://ca.ign.com/articles/2013/10/10/inside-cookie-clicker-and-the-idle-game-movement |archive-date=June 30, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThis genre involves games that orient the player with a trivial task, such as clicking a cookie; and as the game progresses, the player is gradually rewarded certain upgrades for completing said task. In all, these games require very little involvement from the player, and in most cases they play themselves; hence the use of the word \"[[idle]]\".\n\nIn early 2014, Orteil released an early version of ''Idle Game Maker'', a tool allowing customized idle games to be made without coding knowledge.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://orteil.dashnet.org/experiments/idlegamemaker/help |title=Idle Game Maker Documentation |publisher=Orteil.dashnet.org |accessdate=2014-07-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714142951/http://orteil.dashnet.org/experiments/idlegamemaker/help |archive-date=July 14, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n== Video game genres by purpose ==\n\nWhile most video games are designed as entertainment, many video games are designed with additional purposes. These purposes are as varied as the nature of information itself\u2014to inform, persuade, or stimulate. These games can have any kind of gameplay, from puzzles to action to adventure.\n\n=== Advergame ===\n{{main|Advergame}}\n[[Advergame]]s, in the context of video game genres, refers to promotional software specifically made to advertise a product, organization or viewpoint. The first advergames were distributed on floppy disk by the [[Chef Boyardee]], [[Coca-Cola]], and [[Samsung]] brands,<ref name=gamedaily>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/features/dunkin-for-advergames/68443/?biz=1 |title=Dunkin' for Advergames |access-date=January 24, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230013119/http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/features/dunkin-for-advergames/68443/?biz=1 |archive-date=December 30, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> while the first cereal box advergame was [[Chex Quest]] in 1996.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.joystiq.com/2008/04/18/ask-joystiq-chex-quest-he-man-and-broken-360-gamepads/ | title = Ask Joystiq: Chex Quest, He-Man and broken 360 gamepads | publisher = Joystiq | author = Ross Miller | date = April 18, 2008 | accessdate = 2008-07-16 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080517003720/http://www.joystiq.com/2008/04/18/ask-joystiq-chex-quest-he-man-and-broken-360-gamepads/ | archive-date = May 17, 2008 | url-status = dead }}</ref> The majority of advergames are found online and mostly include simple and cheaply made [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] games. Some advergames were released to consoles, like [[Pepsiman (video game)|Pepsiman]] for Sony PlayStation.\n\n=== Art game ===\n{{main|Art game}}\n[[Art game]]s are designed so as to emphasize art or whose structures are intended to produce some kind of non-[[ludology|ludological]] reaction in its audience. Art games typically go out of their way to have a unique, unconventional look, often standing out for aesthetic beauty or complexity in design. This concept extends to the realm of modified (\"modded\") gaming when modifications have been made to existing non-art-games to produce graphic results intended to be viewed as an artistic display, as opposed to modifications intended to change game play scenarios or for storytelling. Modified games created for artistic purposes are sometimes referred to as \"[[videogame art]].\"\n\n=== Casual game ===\n{{main|Casual game}}\n[[Casual game]]s have very simple rules or play techniques and a very low degree of strategy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6186207.html?tag=result;title;0 |title=GDC '08: Are casual games the future? |last=Boyes |first=Emma |date=2008-02-18 |publisher=GameSpot |accessdate=2009-01-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711072428/http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6186207.html?tag=result%3Btitle%3B0 |archivedate=2011-07-11 }}</ref> They also require no long-term time commitment or special skills to play, making them easy to learn and play as a pastime.

The purpose of the casual game is to entertain, but with a much lower commitment than other video games.\n\n=== Christian game ===\n{{main|Christian video games}}\n[[Christian video games|Christian games]] attempt to provide the dual purposes of spreading the [[Christianity|Christian religion]] to non-believers through the medium of video games, and providing gamers who identify as Christian with a common pool of games. Christian video games were first developed by [[Wisdom Tree]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]], without license. While largely regarded as derivative titles by the mainstream gaming culture,{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Christian games have nevertheless expanded in distribution since their inception.\n\n=== Educational game ===\n{{main|Educational game}}\n[[Educational game]]s, as the name implies, attempt to teach the user using the game as a vehicle. Most of these types of games target young users from the ages of about three years to mid-[[teen]]s;{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} past the mid-teens, subjects become so complex (e.g. [[Calculus]]) that teaching via a game is impractical.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Numerous subgenres exist, in fields such as math or typing.\n\n=== Esports ===\n{{main|Esports}}\n[[Esports]] games are [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] games that are usually played competitively at the professional level. These games are often targeted at the \"hardcore\" gaming audience, and are usually [[first-person shooter]] games, requiring twitch-based reaction speed and coordination, or [[real-time strategy]] games, requiring high levels of strategic macro- and micromanagement, or [[MOBA]]s, requiring both.\n\n=== Exergame ===\n{{main|Exergaming}}\nAn [[Exergaming|exergame]] ([[Portmanteau word|portmanteau]] of \"[[exercise]]\" and \"[[video game|game]]\") is a video game that provides exercise. \"Exergames\" sub-divide into two main implementations, those with a game specifically designed to use an exercise input device (for example, the game ''[[Wii Fit]]'' using the [[Wii Balance Board]]) and those implementations using a genre of a game. Games fit into the category of entertainment, and similarly \"exergames\" are a category of \"exertainment\" (formed from \"[[exercise]]\" and \"[[entertainment]]\"). \"Exertainment\" refers to one aspect of adding entertainment to an exercise workout.\n\n=== Personalized game ===\n{{main|Personalized video game}}\n[[Personalized video game|Personalized games]] are created for one specific player or a group of players usually as a gift. They are hand-made to feature real names, places and events from the recipient's life. Usual occasions for such games are birthdays, anniversaries, and engagement proposals.\n\n=== Serious game ===\n{{main|Serious game}}\n[[Serious game]]s are intended to educate or train the player. These games tend to promote \"education, science, social change, health care or even the military.\"<ref name=serious>{{cite web |accessdate=2009-01-23 |url=http://www.cnet.com.au/games/0,239029232,240061367,00.htm |title=What's wrong with serious games? |publisher=CNET |date=2006-03-23 |author=Terdiman, Daniel |authorlink=Daniel Terdiman |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080323102029/http://www.cnet.com.au/games/0,239029232,240061367,00.htm |archive-date=March 23, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Some of these games have no specific ending or goal in the game. Rather, the player learns a real life lesson from the game. For example, games from [[website]]s such as Newsgaming.com and gamesforchange.org raise political issues using the distinct properties of games.\n\n== Scientific studies ==\n\nAs video games are increasingly the subject of scientific studies, game genres are themselves becoming a subject of study.\n\nAn early attempt at analysis of the action and adventure genres appeared in a Game Developers Conference 2000 paper 'Mostly Armless: Grabbing the 3D World'. This critiqued a variety of adventure and action games to categorize gameplay and interaction for adventure, action, and hybrid genres. It provided a graph of the genres along the axes of 'immediacy' vs 'complexity', with an 'ideal-zone' for gameplay that covered and linked adventure and action games. It detailed various interaction styles present in these genres and extrapolated to future user interface and gameplay possibilities for these and other genres. Some of these have since been adopted by persistent worlds. For example, [[Second life|Second Life]] uses some of the gameplay investment and interface elements described in section 4 of the paper.<ref>{{cite web|date=July 2000 |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/gdcarchive/2000/index.htm |title=GDC '00: Mostly Armless: Grabbing the 3D World |author=Rees, David |work=Gamasutra |accessdate=2010-06-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029005902/http://www.gamasutra.com/gdcarchive/2000/index.htm |archivedate=October 29, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIn a [[University of Queensland]] study, game enjoyment was correlated with attributes such as immersion, social interaction, and the nature of the goals.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sweetser|first=Penelope|author2=Wyeth, P. |title=GameFlow: a model for evaluating player enjoyment in games|journal=[[Computers in Entertainment]]|volume=3|year=2005|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1077253|issue=3|doi=10.1145/1077246.1077253|pages=3}}</ref> These may be underlying factors in differentiating game genres.\n\nStatistical scaling techniques were used in a study presented at the 2007 Siggraph Video Game Symposium to convert subject ratings of game similarity into visual maps of game genres.
