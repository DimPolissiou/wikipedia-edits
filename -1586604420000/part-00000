Medical ethics is based on a set of values that professionals can refer to in the case of any confusion or conflict.

The Code of Ethics was then adapted in 1847, relying heavily on Percival's words.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Riddick|first=Frank|year=2003|title=The Code of Medical Ethics of the American Medical Association|journal=The Ochsner Journal|volume=5|issue=2|pages=6\u201310|pmc=3399321|pmid=22826677}}</ref> Over the years in 1903, 1912, and 1947, revisions have been made to the original document.<ref name=\":1\" /> The practice of Medical Ethics is widely accepted and practiced throughout the world.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHistorically, [[Western world|Western]] medical ethics may be traced to guidelines on the [[duty]] of physicians in antiquity, such as the [[Hippocratic Oath]], and early [[Christianity|Christian]] teachings. The first code of medical ethics, ''[[Formula Comitis Archiatrorum]]'', was published in the 5th century, during the reign of the [[Ostrogoths|Ostrogothic]] king [[Theodoric the Great]]. In the medieval and early modern period, the field is indebted to [[Medicine in the medieval Islamic world|Islamic scholarship]] such as [[Al-Ruhawi|Ishaq ibn Ali al-Ruhawi]] (who wrote the ''Conduct of a Physician'', the first book dedicated to medical ethics), [[Avicenna]]'s [[The Canon of Medicine|Canon of Medicine]] and [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya ar-Razi]] (known as Rhazes in the West), [[Judeo-Islamic philosophies (800\u20131400)|Jewish thinkers]] such as [[Maimonides]], [[Roman Catholic]] [[scholasticism|scholastic]] thinkers such as [[Thomas Aquinas]], and the case-oriented analysis ([[casuistry]]) of Catholic [[moral theology]]. These intellectual traditions continue in [[Catholic ethics|Catholic]], [[Islamic ethics#Medical ethics|Islamic]] and [[Jewish medical ethics]].\n\nBy the 18th and 19th centuries, medical ethics emerged as a more self-conscious discourse. In England, [[Thomas Percival]], a physician and author, crafted the first modern code of medical ethics. He drew up a pamphlet with the code in 1794 and wrote an expanded version in 1803, in which he coined the expressions \"medical ethics\" and \"medical jurisprudence\".<ref>[http://ethics.iit.edu/perspective/pers19_1fall99_2.html ''Codes of Ethics: Some History'', Center for the Study of Ethics in the Professions at IIT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206204827/http://ethics.iit.edu/perspective/pers19_1fall99_2.html |date=2012-02-06 }}</ref> However, there are some who see Percival's guidelines that relate to physician consultations as being excessively protective of the home physician's reputation.

Therefore, it can be said that autonomy is a general indicator of a healthy mind and body. The progression of many terminal diseases are characterized by loss of autonomy, in various manners and extents. For example, [[dementia]], a chronic and progressive disease that attacks the brain can induce memory loss and cause a decrease in rational thinking, almost always results in the loss of autonomy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burla|first=Claudia|date=2014|title=Alzheimer, Dementia and the living will: a proposal|pmc=4078222|journal=Medicine, Health Care and Philosophy|volume=17|issue=3|pages=389\u2013395|doi=10.1007/s11019-014-9559-8|pmid=24737537}}</ref>\n\nPsychiatrists and clinical psychologists are often asked to evaluate a patient's capacity for making life-and-death decisions at the end of life.

In the medical context, this means taking actions that serve the best interests of patients and their families.<ref name=\":15\" /> However, uncertainty surrounds the precise definition of which practices do in fact help patients.\n\n[[James Childress]] and [[Tom Beauchamp]] in ''Principle of Biomedical Ethics'' (1978) identify beneficence as one of the core values of [[healthcare ethics]]. Some scholars, such as [[Edmund D. Pellegrino|Edmund Pellegrino]], argue that beneficence is the ''only'' fundamental principle of medical ethics. They argue that healing should be the sole purpose of medicine, and that endeavors like [[cosmetic surgery]] and [[euthanasia]] are severely unethical and against the [[Hippocratic Oath]].\n\n===Non-maleficence===\n{{Main|Primum non nocere}}\nThe concept of non-maleficence is embodied by the phrase, \"first, do no harm,\" or the Latin, ''[[primum non nocere]]''. Many consider that should be the main or primary consideration (hence ''primum''): that it is more important not to harm your patient, than to do them good, which is part of the Hippocratic oath that doctors take.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jotterand|first=Fabrice|date=2005-01-01|title=The Hippocratic Oath and Contemporary Medicine: Dialectic Between Past Ideals and Present Reality?|journal=The Journal of Medicine and Philosophy|language=en|volume=30|issue=1|pages=107\u2013128|doi=10.1080/03605310590907084|pmid=15814370|issn=0360-5310|df=}}</ref> This is partly because enthusiastic practitioners are prone to using treatments that they believe will do good, without first having evaluated them adequately to ensure they do no harm to the patient. Much harm has been done to patients as a result, as in the saying, \"The treatment was a success, but the patient died.\" It is not only more important to do no harm than to do good; it is also important to ''know'' how likely it is that your treatment will harm a patient. So a physician should go further than not prescribing medications they know to be harmful\u2014he or she should not prescribe medications (or otherwise treat the patient) unless s/he knows that the treatment is unlikely to be harmful; or at the very least, that patient understands the risks and benefits, and that the likely benefits outweigh the likely risks.\n\nIn practice, however, many treatments carry some risk of harm. In some circumstances, e.g. in desperate situations where the outcome without treatment will be grave, risky treatments that stand a high chance of harming the patient will be justified, as the risk of not treating is also very likely to do harm. So the principle of ''non-maleficence'' is not absolute, and balances against the principle of [[#Beneficence|''beneficence'']] (doing good), as the effects of the two principles together often give rise to a ''double effect'' (further described in next section). Even basic actions like taking a blood sample or an injection of a drug cause harm to the patient's body. [[Euthanasia]] also goes against the principle of beneficence because the patient dies as a result of the medical treatment by the doctor.\n\n====Double effect====\n{{Main|Principle of double effect}}\n''Double effect'' refers to two types of consequences that may be produced by a single action,<ref>[http://medical.webends.com/kw/Double%20Effect Medical.Webends.com > Double effect] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100905010101/http://medical.webends.com/kw/Double%2BEffect |date=2010-09-05 }} Retrieved September 2010</ref> and in medical ethics it is usually regarded as the combined effect of beneficence and non-maleficence.<ref>Page 424 in:{{cite book|title=Primary hematology|author=Tefferi, Ayalew|publisher=Humana Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0-89603-664-2|location=Totowa, NJ|pages=|doi=|oclc=|accessdate=}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=vYqJoUFFM2wC&pg=PA424&lpg]</ref>\n\nA commonly cited example of this phenomenon is the use of [[morphine]] or other [[analgesic]] in the dying patient.

Like recommendations, they set forth universal principles to which the community of States wished to attribute the greatest possible authority and to afford the broadest possible support.\" UNESCO adopted the ''Universal Declaration on Human Rights and Biomedicine'' to advance the application of international human rights law in medical ethics. The Declaration provides special protection of human rights for incompetent persons. \n<blockquote>\nIn applying and advancing scientific knowledge, medical practice and associated technologies, human vulnerability should be taken into account.

When the patient's interests conflict with the patient's welfare, different societies settle the conflict in a wide range of manners. In general, Western medicine defers to the wishes of a mentally competent patient to make their own decisions, even in cases where the medical team believes that they are not acting in their own best interests. However, many other societies prioritize beneficence over autonomy.\n\nExamples include when a patient does not want a treatment because of, for example, religious or cultural views. In the case of [[euthanasia]], the patient, or relatives of a patient, may want to end the life of the patient. Also, the patient may want an [[Unnecessary health care|unnecessary treatment]], as can be the case in [[hypochondria]] or with [[cosmetic surgery]]; here, the practitioner may be required to balance the desires of the patient for medically unnecessary potential risks against the patient's informed autonomy in the issue. A doctor may want to prefer autonomy because refusal to please the patient's self-determination would harm the [[doctor-patient relationship]].\n\n[[Organ donation]]s can sometimes pose interesting scenarios, in which a patient is classified as a non-heart beating donor ([[Non-heart-beating donation|NHBD]]), where life support fails to restore the heartbeat and is now considered futile but brain death has not occurred.<ref name=\":7\" /> Classifying a patient as a NHBD can qualify someone to be subject to non-therapeutic intensive care, in which treatment is only given to preserve the organs that will be donated and not to preserve the life of the donor.<ref name=\":7\" /> This can bring up ethical issues as some may see respect for the donors wishes to donate their healthy organs as respect for autonomy, while others may view the sustaining of futile treatment during vegetative state maleficence for the patient and the patient's family.<ref name=\":7\" /> Some are worried making this process a worldwide customary measure may dehumanize and take away from the natural process of dying and what it brings along with it.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nIndividuals' capacity for informed decision-making may come into question during resolution of conflicts between autonomy and beneficence. The role of surrogate medical decision-makers is an extension of the principle of autonomy.\n\nOn the other hand, autonomy and beneficence/non-maleficence may also overlap. For example, a breach of patients' autonomy may cause decreased confidence for medical services in the population and subsequently less willingness to seek help, which in turn may cause inability to perform beneficence.\n\nThe principles of autonomy and beneficence/non-maleficence may also be expanded to include effects on the relatives of patients or even the medical practitioners, the overall population and economic issues when making medical decisions.\n\n===Euthanasia===\n{{Main|Euthanasia}}\n\nThere is disagreement among American physicians as to whether the non-maleficence principle excludes the practice of euthanasia. Euthanasia is currently legal in the states of Washington DC, California, Colorado, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington. Around the world, there are different organizations that campaign to change legislation about the issue of [[physician-assisted death]], or PAD. Examples of such organizations are the [[Hemlock Society]] of the United States and the [[Dignity in Dying]] campaign in the United Kingdom. These groups believe that doctors should be given the right to end a patient's life only if the patient is conscious enough to decide for themselves, is knowledgeable about the possibility of alternative care, and has willingly asked to end their life or requested access to the means to do so.\n\nThis argument is disputed in other parts of the world. For example, in the state of Louisiana, giving advice or supplying the means to end a person's life is considered a criminal act and can be charged as a felony. In state courts, this crime is comparable to manslaughter. The same laws apply in the states of Mississippi and Nebraska.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/michstate/reader.action?docID=10021934|title=Euthanasia, Ethics and Public Policy: an Argument against Legislation|last=Keown|first=John|date=2002|website=Protest ebrary|access-date=}}{{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\n==Informed consent==\n{{Main|Informed consent}}\n{{more citations needed|section|date=November 2018}}\nInformed consent in ethics usually refers to the idea that a person must be fully informed about and understand the potential benefits and risks of their choice of treatment. A correlate to \"informed consent\" is the concept of [[informed refusal]]. An uninformed person is at risk of mistakenly making a choice not reflective of his or her values or wishes. It does not specifically mean the process of obtaining consent, or the specific legal requirements, which vary from place to place, for capacity to consent. Patients can elect to make their own medical decisions or can delegate decision-making authority to another party. If the patient is incapacitated, laws around the world designate different processes for obtaining informed consent, typically by having a person appointed by the patient or their [[next of kin]] make decisions for them. The value of informed consent is closely related to the values of [[autonomy]] and truth telling.\n\n==Confidentiality==\n{{Further|Confidentiality}}\n[[Confidentiality]] is commonly applied to conversations between doctors and patients. This concept is commonly known as patient-physician privilege. Legal protections prevent physicians from revealing their discussions with patients, even under oath in court.\n\nConfidentiality is mandated in the United States by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 known as [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]], specifically the Privacy Rule, and various state laws, some more rigorous than HIPAA. However, numerous exceptions to the rules have been carved out over the years. For example, many states require physicians to report gunshot wounds to the police and impaired drivers to the [[Department of Motor Vehicles]]. Confidentiality is also challenged in cases involving the diagnosis of a sexually transmitted disease in a patient who refuses to reveal the diagnosis to a spouse, and in the termination of a pregnancy in an underage patient, without the knowledge of the patient's parents. Many states in the U.S. have laws governing parental notification in underage abortion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/IssuesResearch/Health/AbortionLaws/tabid/14401/Default.aspx#parent|title=Legislative News, Studies and Analysis \u2013 National Conference of State Legislatures|first=National Conference of State|last=Legislatures|website=www.ncsl.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100224232857/http://www.ncsl.org/IssuesResearch/Health/AbortionLaws/tabid/14401/Default.aspx#parent|archivedate=2010-02-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncsl.org/programs/health/aborlaws.htm |title=National Conference of State Legislatures > Abortion Laws > Parental Involvement in Minors' Abortions |publisher=Webarchive.loc.gov |accessdate=2018-05-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090429230410/http://www.ncsl.org/programs/health/aborlaws.htm |archivedate=2009-04-29 }}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, medical ethics has viewed the duty of confidentiality as a relatively non-negotiable tenet of medical practice. More recently, critics like [[Jacob M. Appel|Jacob Appel]] have argued for a more nuanced approach to the duty that acknowledges the need for flexibility in many cases.<ref name=\":16\">Appel, JM.

Rethinking Confidentiality In the HIV Era, ''Medicine and Health Rhode Island'', Jun 2006</ref>\n\nConfidentiality is an important issue in [[primary care ethics]], where physicians care for many patients from the same family and community, and where third parties often request information from the considerable medical database typically gathered in primary health care.\n\n===Healthcare practice and privacy in an Online World===\nIn increasing frequency, medical researchers are researching activities in online environments such as discussion boards and bulletin boards, and there is concern that the requirements of informed consent and privacy are not applied, although some guidelines do exist.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Eysenbach G, Till JE|year=2001|title=Ethical issues in qualitative research on internet communities|journal=BMJ|volume=323|issue=7321|pages=1103\u201305|doi=10.1136/bmj.323.7321.1103|pmc=59687|pmid=11701577}}</ref>\n\nOne issue that has arisen, however, is the disclosure of information. While researchers wish to quote from the original source in order to argue a point, this can have repercussions when the identity of the patient is not kept confidential. The quotations and other information about the site can be used to identify the patient, and researchers have reported cases where members of the site, bloggers and others have used this information as 'clues' in a game in an attempt to identify the site.<ref name=\"Bruckman A 2002 217\u201331\">{{cite journal|author=Bruckman A|year=2002|title=Studying the amateur artist: A perspective on disguising data collected in human subjects research on the Internet|journal=Ethics and Information Technology|volume=4|issue=3|pages=217\u201331|doi=10.1023/A:1021316409277}}</ref> Some researchers have employed various methods of \"heavy disguise.\"<ref name=\"Bruckman A 2002 217\u201331\" /> including discussing a different condition from that under study.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Turkle S|year=1994|title=Constructions and Reconstructions of Self in Virtual Reality|journal=Mind, Culture, and Activity|volume=1|issue=3|pages=158\u201367|doi=10.1080/10749039409524667}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Turkle S|year=1997|title=Multiple subjectivity and virtual community at the end of the Freudian century|journal=Sociological Inquiry|volume=67|issue=1|pages=72\u201384|doi=10.1111/j.1475-682X.1997.tb00430.x}}</ref>\n\nHealthcare institutions' websites have the responsibility to ensure that the private medical records of their online visitors are secure from being marketed and monetized into the hands of drug companies, occupation records, and insurance companies.

[[The American Medical Association (AMA)]] states that medical websites have the responsibility to ensure the health care privacy of online visitors and protect patient records from being marketed and monetized into the hands of insurance companies, employers, and marketers. [[Medical ethics#cite note-40|[40]]] With the rapid unification of healthcare, business practices, computer science and e-commerce to create these online diagnostic websites, efforts to maintain health care system's ethical confidentiality standard need to keep up as well. Over the next few years, the Department of Health and Human Services have stated that they will be working towards lawfully protecting the online privacy and digital transfers of patient Electronic Medical Records (EMR) under The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). [[Medical ethics#cite note-41|[41]]]\n\n==Control and resolution==\nTo ensure that appropriate ethical values are being applied within hospitals, effective [[hospital accreditation]] requires that ethical considerations are taken into account, for example with respect to physician integrity, [[conflict of interest]], research ethics and [[organ transplantation]] ethics.\n\n===Guidelines===\nThere is much documentation of the history and necessity of the Declaration of Helsinki. The first code of conduct for research including medical ethics was the Nuremberg Code. This document had large ties to Nazi war crimes, as it was introduced in 1947, so it didn't make much of a difference in terms of regulating practice. This issue called for the creation of the Declaration. There are some stark differences between the Nuremberg Code and the Declaration of Helsinki, including the way it is written. Nuremberg was written in a very concise manner, with a simple explanation. The Declaration of Helsinki is written with a thorough explanation in mind and including many specific commentaries.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Goodyear|first=Micheal D.E|date=2007|title=The Declaration of Helsinki|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=335|issue=7621|pages=624\u20135|id={{ProQuest|1777992607}}|doi=10.1136/bmj.39339.610000.BE|pmid=17901471|pmc=1995496}}</ref>\n\nIn the United Kingdom, [[General Medical Council]] provides clear overall modern guidance in the form of its 'Good Medical Practice' statement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gmc-uk.org/guidance/good_medical_practice/index.asp |title=Good medical practice \u2013 GMC |publisher=Gmc-uk.org |accessdate=2018-05-24 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221112745/http://www.gmc-uk.org/guidance/good_medical_practice/index.asp |archivedate=2008-12-21 }}</ref> Other organizations, such as the [[Medical Protection Society]] and a number of university departments, are often consulted by British doctors regarding issues relating to ethics.\n\n===Ethics committees===\nOften, simple communication is not enough to resolve a conflict, and a hospital [[ethics committee]] must convene to decide a complex matter.\n\nThese bodies are composed primarily of healthcare professionals, but may also include [[philosopher]]s, lay people, and [[clergy]] \u2013 indeed, in many parts of the world their presence is considered mandatory in order to provide balance.\n\nWith respect to the expected composition of such bodies in the US, Europe and Australia, the following applies.<ref>[http://www.chrcrm.org/main/modules/pageworks/index.php?page=015&id=231]{{dead link|date=September 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\nU.S. recommendations suggest that Research and Ethical Boards (REBs) should have five or more members, including at least one scientist, one non-scientist, and one person not affiliated with the institution. The REB should include people knowledgeable in the law and standards of practice and professional conduct. Special memberships are advocated for handicapped or disabled concerns, if required by the protocol under review.\n\nThe European Forum for Good Clinical Practice (EFGCP) suggests that REBs include two practicing physicians who share experience in biomedical research and are independent from the institution where the research is conducted; one lay person; one lawyer; and one paramedical professional, e.g. nurse or pharmacist. They recommend that a quorum include both sexes from a wide age range and reflect the cultural make-up of the local community.\n\nThe 1996 Australian Health Ethics Committee recommendations were entitled, \"Membership Generally of Institutional Ethics Committees\". They suggest a chairperson be preferably someone not employed or otherwise connected with the institution. Members should include a person with knowledge and experience in professional care, counseling or treatment of humans; a minister of religion or equivalent, e.g. Aboriginal elder; a layman; a laywoman; a lawyer and, in the case of a hospital-based ethics committee, a nurse.\n</blockquote>\n\nThe assignment of philosophers or religious clerics will reflect the importance attached by the [[society]] to the basic values involved. An example from [[Sweden]] with [[Torbj\u00f6rn T\u00e4nnsj\u00f6]] on a couple of such committees indicates [[secular]] trends gaining influence.\n\n==Cultural concerns==\nCultural differences can create difficult medical ethics problems. Some cultures have [[Spiritualism (beliefs)|spiritual]] or magical theories about the origins and cause of disease, for example, and reconciling these beliefs with the tenets of [[Medicine|Western medicine]] can be very difficult. As different cultures continue to intermingle and more cultures live alongside each other, the healthcare system, which tends to deal with important life events such as birth, death and suffering, increasingly experiences difficult dilemmas that can sometimes lead to cultural clashes and conflict. Efforts to respond in a culturally sensitive manner go hand in hand with a need to distinguish limits to cultural tolerance.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=A Cross-Cultural Dialogue on Health Care Ethics.|last=Coward|first=Harold G.|publisher=Waterloo, Ont : Wilfrid Laurier university Press.|year=1999|isbn=9780889208551|location=Canada|pages=119\u2013126}}</ref>\n\n=== Culture and Language ===\nAs more people from different cultural and religious backgrounds move to other countries, among these, the United States, it is becoming increasingly important to be culturally sensitive to all communities in order to provide the best health care for all people.<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite journal|last=A.

A common complaint patients have is feeling like they are not being heard, or perhaps, understood.<ref name=\":13\" /> Preventing escalating conflict can be accomplished by seeking interpreters, noticing body language and tone of both yourself and the patient as well as attempting to understand the patient's perspective in order to reach an acceptable option.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nSome believe most medical practitioners in the future will have to be or greatly benefit from being bilingual. In addition to knowing the language, truly understanding culture is best for optimal care.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Franz, W.

Interpreting a patient's stories or day-to-day activities as opposed to standardizing and collecting patient data may help in acquiring a better sense of what each patient needs, individually, with respect to their illness. Without this background information, many physicians are unable to properly understand the cultural differences that may set two different patients apart, and thus, may diagnose or recommend treatments that are culturally insensitive or inappropriate. In short, patient narrative has the potential for uncovering patient information and preferences that may otherwise be overlooked.\n\n=== Medical humanitarianism ===\nIn order to address the undeserved, uneducated communities in need of nutrition, housing, and healthcare disparities seen in much of the world today, some argue that we must fall back on ethical values in order to create a foundation to move towards a reasonable understanding, which encourages commitment and motivation to improve factors causing premature death as a goal in a global community.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite journal|last=Prah Ruger|first=Jennifer|date=October 2014|title=Good medical ethics, justice and provincial globalism|journal=J Med Ethics|volume=41|issue=1|pages=103\u2013106|jstor=43283237|doi=10.1136/medethics-2014-102356|pmid=25516948}}</ref> Such factors -such as poverty, environment and education- are said to be out of national or individual control and so this commitment is by default a social and communal responsibility placed on global communities that are able to aid others in need.<ref name=\":9\" /> This is based on the framework of 'provincial globalism,' which seeks a world in which all people have the capability to be healthy.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nOne concern regarding the intersection of medical ethics and humanitarian medical aid is how medical assistance can be as harmful as it is helpful to the community being served. One such example being how political forces may control how foreign humanitarian aid can be utilized in the region it is meant to be provided in. This would be congruous in situations where political strife could lead such aid being used in favor of one group over another. Another example of how foreign humanitarian aid can be misused in its intended community includes the possibility of dissonance forming between a foreign humanitarian aid group and the community being served.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wisnewski|first=Jeremy|date=December 2015|title=Perceiving Sympathetically: Moral Perception, Embodiment, and Medical Ethics|doi=10.1007/s10912-015-9349-1|pmid=26164290|journal=Journal of Medical Humanities|volume=36|issue=4|pages=309\u2013319}}</ref> Examples of this could include the relationships being viewed between aid workers, style of dress, or the lack of education regarding local culture and customs.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Asgary, Junck|first=Ramin, Emily|year=2013|title=New trends of short-term humanitarian medical volunteerism: professional and ethical considerations|url=|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|volume=39|issue=10|pages=625\u2013631|doi=10.1136/medethics-2011-100488|pmid=23236086}}</ref>\n\nHumanitarian practices in areas lacking optimum care can also pause other interesting and difficult ethical dilemmas in terms of beneficence and non-maleficence.

On the other hand, wanting certain procedures done in a specific manner due to religious or cultural belief systems may also occur. The ethical dilemma stems from differences in culture between communities helping those with medical disparities and the societies receiving aid. Women's rights, informed consent and education about health become controversial, as some treatments needed are against societal law, while some cultural traditions involve procedures  against humanitarian efforts.<ref name=\":6\" /> Examples of this are [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM), aiding in [[reinfibulation]], providing sterile equipment in order to perform procedures such as FGM, as well as informing patients of their HIV positive testing.

However, Buddhist teachings support living one's life to the fullest so that through all the suffering which encompasses a large part of what is life, there are no regrets. Buddhism accepts suffering as an inescapable experience, but values happiness and thus values life.<ref name=\":5\" /> Because of this suicide, and euthanasia, are prohibited. However, attempts to rid oneself of any physical or mental pain and suffering are seen as good acts. On the other hand, sedatives and drugs are thought to impair consciousness and awareness in the dying process, which is believed to be of great importance, as it is thought that one's dying consciousness remains and affects new life. Because of this, analgesics must not be part of the dying process, in order for the dying person to be present entirely and pass on their consciousness wholesomely.

Furthermore, a person is never seen as a single unit but rather as a source of relationship, interconnected in a social web.<ref name=\":5\" /> Thus, it is believed that what makes a human one of us is relatedness and communication and family is seen as the basic unit of a community.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":12\">{{Cite journal|last=Ahmed|first=Furqaan|date=August 2013|title=Are medical ethics universal or culture specific|journal=World Journal of Gastrointestinal Pharmacology and Therapeutics|volume=4|issue=3|pages=47\u201348|pmc=3729866|pmid=23919215|doi=10.4292/wjgpt.v4.i3.47}}</ref> This can greatly affect the way medical decisions are made among family members, as diagnoses are not always expected to be announced to the dying or sick, the elderly are expected to be cared for and represented by their children and physicians are expected to act in a paternalistic way.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":12\" /> In short, informed consent as well as patient privacy can be difficult to enforce when dealing with Confucian families.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nFurthermore, some Chinese people may be inclined to continue futile treatment in order to extend life and allow for fulfillment of the practice of benevolence and humanity.<ref name=\":5\" /> In contrast, patients with strong [[Taoism|Daoist]] beliefs may see death as an obstacle and dying as a reunion with nature that should be accepted, and are therefore less likely to ask for treatment of an irreversible condition.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==== Islamic culture and medicine ====\nSome believe Islamic medical ethics and framework remain poorly understood by many working in healthcare.

An example of this is requesting same gender providers in order to retain modesty.<ref name=\":11\" /> Overall, Beauchamp's principles of beneficence, non-maleficence and justice <ref name=\":15\" /> are promoted and upheld in the medical sphere with as much importance as in Western culture.<ref name=\":11\" /> In contrast, autonomy is important but more nuanced.

Out of the many disciplines in current medicine, there are studies that have been conducted in order to ascertain the occurrence of Doctor-Patient sexual misconduct.

Some of these cases are examined in court.\n\nAdvance directives include [[living wills]] and durable [[power of attorney|powers of attorney]] for health care. (''See also [[Do Not Resuscitate]] and [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]]'') In many cases, the \"expressed wishes\" of the patient are documented in these directives, and this provides a framework to guide family members and [[health care]] professionals in the decision-making process when the patient is incapacitated. Undocumented expressed wishes can also help guide decisions in the absence of advance directives, as in the [[Quinlan case]] in Missouri.\n\n\"Substituted judgment\" is the concept that a family member can give consent for treatment if the patient is unable (or unwilling) to give consent themselves. The key question for the decision-making surrogate is not, \"What would you like to do?\", but instead, \"What do you think the patient would want in this situation?\".\n\nCourts have supported family's arbitrary definitions of futility to include simple biological survival, as in the [[Baby K]] case (in which the courts ordered a child born with only a brain stem instead of a complete brain to be kept on a ventilator based on the religious belief that all life must be preserved).\n\n[[Baby Doe Law]] establishes state protection for a disabled child's right to life, ensuring that this right is protected even over the wishes of parents or guardians in cases where they want to withhold treatment.\n\n==See also==\n{{col div|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Applied ethics]]\n* [[Bioethics]]\n* ''[[The Citadel (novel)|The Citadel]]''\n* ''[[Clinical Ethics]]''\n* [[Clinical governance]]\n* [[Do not resuscitate]]\n* [[Empathy]]\n* [[Ethical code]]\n* [[Ethics of circumcision]]\n* [[Euthanasia]]\n* [[Evidence-based medical ethics]]\n* [[Fee splitting]]\n* [[Hastings Center]]\n* [[Health ethics]]\n* [[Hippocratic Oath]]\n* [[Human radiation experiments]]\n* [[Islamic bioethics]]\n* [[Jewish medical ethics]]\n* [[Joint Commission International]], JCI\n* [[MacLean Center for Clinical Medical Ethics]]\n* [[Medical Code of Ethics]]\n* [[Medical Law International]]\n* [[Medical law]]\n* [[Medical torture]]\n** [[Pharmacological torture]]\n* [[Military medical ethics]]\n* [[Nursing ethics]]\n* [[Patient abuse]]\n* [[Philosophy of Healthcare]]\n* [[Political abuse of psychiatry]]\n* [[Project MKULTRA]]\n* [[Research ethics consultation]]\n* [[Resources for clinical ethics consultation]]\n* [[Right to health]]\n* [[Seven Sins of Medicine]]\n* [[U.S. patients' bill of rights]]\n* [[UN Principles of Medical Ethics]]\n* [[Unethical human experimentation]]\n* [[World Medical Association]]\n{{colend}}\n\n===Reproductive medicine===\n* [[Abortion]] / [[Abortion debate]]\n* [[Eugenics]]\n* [[Gene splicing]]\n* [[Human cloning]]\n* [[Human genetic engineering]]\n* [[Human trafficking]]\n\n===Medical research===\n{{col div|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Animal testing]]\n* [[Children in clinical research]]\n* [[CIOMS Guidelines]]\n* [[Clinical equipoise|Clinical Equipoise]]\n* [[Clinical research ethics]]\n* [[Declaration of Geneva]]\n* [[Declaration of Helsinki]]\n* [[Declaration of Tokyo]]\n* [[Ethical problems using children in clinical trials]]\n* [[First-in-man study]]\n* [[Good clinical practice]]\n* [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]]\n* [[Institutional Review Board]]\n* [[Nuremberg Code]]\n* [[Research ethics consultation]]\n* [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==Sources and references==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n*Beauchamp, Tom L., and Childress, James F. 2001.

The first code of medical ethics, ''[[Formula Comitis Archiatrorum]]'', was published in the 5th century, during the reign of the [[Ostrogoths|Ostrogothic]] king [[Theodoric the Great]]. In the medieval and early modern period, the field is indebted to [[Medicine in the medieval Islamic world|Islamic scholarship]] such as [[Al-Ruhawi|Ishaq ibn Ali al-Ruhawi]] (who wrote the ''Conduct of a Physician'', the first book dedicated to medical ethics), [[Avicenna]]'s [[The Canon of Medicine|Canon of Medicine]] and [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya ar-Razi]] (known as Rhazes in the West), [[Judeo-Islamic philosophies (800\u20131400)|Jewish thinkers]] such as [[Maimonides]], [[Roman Catholic]] [[scholasticism|scholastic]] thinkers such as [[Thomas Aquinas]], and the case-oriented analysis ([[casuistry]]) of Catholic [[moral theology]]. These intellectual traditions continue in [[Catholic ethics|Catholic]], [[Islamic ethics#Medical ethics|Islamic]] and [[Jewish medical ethics]].\n\nBy the 18th and 19th centuries, medical ethics emerged as a more self-conscious discourse. In England, [[Thomas Percival]], a physician and author, crafted the first modern code of medical ethics. He drew up a pamphlet with the code in 1794 and wrote an expanded version in 1803, in which he coined the expressions \"medical ethics\" and \"medical jurisprudence\".<ref>[http://ethics.iit.edu/perspective/pers19_1fall99_2.html ''Codes of Ethics: Some History'', Center for the Study of Ethics in the Professions at IIT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206204827/http://ethics.iit.edu/perspective/pers19_1fall99_2.html |date=2012-02-06 }}</ref> However, there are some who see Percival's guidelines that relate to physician consultations as being excessively protective of the home physician's reputation.

Therefore, it can be said that autonomy is a general indicator of a healthy mind and body.

For example, [[dementia]], a chronic and progressive disease that attacks the brain can induce memory loss and cause a decrease in rational thinking, almost always results in the loss of autonomy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burla|first=Claudia|date=2014|title=Alzheimer, Dementia and the living will: a proposal|pmc=4078222|journal=Medicine, Health Care and Philosophy|volume=17|issue=3|pages=389\u2013395|doi=10.1007/s11019-014-9559-8|pmid=24737537}}</ref>\n\nPsychiatrists and clinical psychologists are often asked to evaluate a patient's capacity for making life-and-death decisions at the end of life.

In the medical context, this means taking actions that serve the best interests of patients and their families.<ref name=\":15\" /> However, uncertainty surrounds the precise definition of which practices do in fact help patients.\n\n[[James Childress]] and [[Tom Beauchamp]] in ''Principle of Biomedical Ethics'' (1978) identify beneficence as one of the core values of [[healthcare ethics]]. Some scholars, such as [[Edmund D. Pellegrino|Edmund Pellegrino]], argue that beneficence is the ''only'' fundamental principle of medical ethics. They argue that healing should be the sole purpose of medicine, and that endeavors like [[cosmetic surgery]] and [[euthanasia]] are severely unethical and against the [[Hippocratic Oath]].\n\n===Non-maleficence===\n{{Main|Primum non nocere}}\nThe concept of non-maleficence is embodied by the phrase, \"first, do no harm,\" or the Latin, ''[[primum non nocere]]''. Many consider that should be the main or primary consideration (hence ''primum''): that it is more important not to harm your patient, than to do them good, which is part of the hippocratic oath that doctors take.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jotterand|first=Fabrice|date=2005-01-01|title=The Hippocratic Oath and Contemporary Medicine: Dialectic Between Past Ideals and Present Reality?|journal=The Journal of Medicine and Philosophy|language=en|volume=30|issue=1|pages=107\u2013128|doi=10.1080/03605310590907084|pmid=15814370|issn=0360-5310|df=}}</ref> This is partly because enthusiastic practitioners are prone to using treatments that they believe will do good, without first having evaluated them adequately to ensure they do no harm to the patient. Much harm has been done to patients as a result, as in the saying, \"The treatment was a success, but the patient died.\" It is not only more important to do no harm than to do good; it is also important to ''know'' how likely it is that your treatment will harm a patient. So a physician should go further than not prescribing medications they know to be harmful\u2014he or she should not prescribe medications (or otherwise treat the patient) unless s/he knows that the treatment is unlikely to be harmful; or at the very least, that patient understands the risks and benefits, and that the likely benefits outweigh the likely risks.\n\nIn practice, however, many treatments carry some risk of harm. In some circumstances, e.g. in desperate situations where the outcome without treatment will be grave, risky treatments that stand a high chance of harming the patient will be justified, as the risk of not treating is also very likely to do harm. So the principle of ''non-maleficence'' is not absolute, and balances against the principle of [[#Beneficence|''beneficence'']] (doing good), as the effects of the two principles together often give rise to a ''double effect'' (further described in next section). Even basic actions like taking a blood sample or an injection of a drug cause harm to the patient's body. [[Euthanasia]] also goes against the principle of beneficence because the patient dies as a result of the medical treatment by the doctor.\n\n====Double effect====\n{{Main|Principle of double effect}}\n''Double effect'' refers to two types of consequences that may be produced by a single action,<ref>[http://medical.webends.com/kw/Double%20Effect Medical.Webends.com > Double effect] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100905010101/http://medical.webends.com/kw/Double%2BEffect |date=2010-09-05 }} Retrieved September 2010</ref> and in medical ethics it is usually regarded as the combined effect of beneficence and non-maleficence.<ref>Page 424 in:{{cite book|title=Primary hematology|author=Tefferi, Ayalew|publisher=Humana Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0-89603-664-2|location=Totowa, NJ|pages=|doi=|oclc=|accessdate=}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=vYqJoUFFM2wC&pg=PA424&lpg]</ref>\n\nA commonly cited example of this phenomenon is the use of [[morphine]] or other [[analgesic]] in the dying patient.

Like recommendations, they set forth universal principles to which the community of States wished to attribute the greatest possible authority and to afford the broadest possible support.\" UNESCO adopted the ''Universal Declaration on Human Rights and Biomedicine'' to advance the application of international human rights law in medical ethics. The Declaration provides special protection of human rights for incompetent persons. \n<blockquote>\nIn applying and advancing scientific knowledge, medical practice and associated technologies, human vulnerability should be taken into account.

When the patient's interests conflict with the patient's welfare, different societies settle the conflict in a wide range of manners. In general, Western medicine defers to the wishes of a mentally competent patient to make their own decisions, even in cases where the medical team believes that they are not acting in their own best interests. However, many other societies prioritize beneficence over autonomy.\n\nExamples include when a patient does not want a treatment because of, for example, religious or cultural views. In the case of [[euthanasia]], the patient, or relatives of a patient, may want to end the life of the patient. Also, the patient may want an [[Unnecessary health care|unnecessary treatment]], as can be the case in [[hypochondria]] or with [[cosmetic surgery]]; here, the practitioner may be required to balance the desires of the patient for medically unnecessary potential risks against the patient's informed autonomy in the issue. A doctor may want to prefer autonomy because refusal to please the patient's self-determination would harm the [[doctor-patient relationship]].\n\n[[Organ donation]]s can sometimes pose interesting scenarios, in which a patient is classified as a non-heart beating donors ([[Non-heart-beating donation|NHBD]]), where life support fails to restore the heartbeat and is now considered futile but brain death has not occurred.<ref name=\":7\" /> Classifying a patient as a NHBD can qualify someone to be subject to non-therapeutic intensive care, in which treatment is only given to preserve the organs that will be donated and not to preserve the life of the donor.<ref name=\":7\" /> This can bring up ethical issues as some may see respect for the donors wishes to donate their healthy organs as respect for autonomy, while others may view the sustaining of futile treatment during vegetative state maleficence for the patient and the patient's family.<ref name=\":7\" /> Some are worried making this process a worldwide customary measure may dehumanize and take away from the natural process of dying and what it brings along with it.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nIndividuals' capacity for informed decision-making may come into question during resolution of conflicts between autonomy and beneficence. The role of surrogate medical decision makers is an extension of the principle of autonomy.\n\nOn the other hand, autonomy and beneficence/non-maleficence may also overlap. For example, a breach of patients' autonomy may cause decreased confidence for medical services in the population and subsequently less willingness to seek help, which in turn may cause inability to perform beneficence.\n\nThe principles of autonomy and beneficence/non-maleficence may also be expanded to include effects on the relatives of patients or even the medical practitioners, the overall population and economic issues when making medical decisions.\n\n===Euthanasia===\n{{Main|Euthanasia}}\n\nThere is disagreement among American physicians as to whether the non-maleficence principle excludes the practice of euthanasia. Euthanasia is currently legal in the states of Washington DC, California, Colorado, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington. Around the world, there are different organizations that campaign to change legislation about the issue of [[physician-assisted death]], or PAD. Examples of such organizations are the [[Hemlock Society]] of the United States and the [[Dignity in Dying]] campaign in the United Kingdom. These groups believe that doctors should be given the right to end a patient's life only if the patient is conscious enough to decide for themselves, is knowledgeable about the possibility of alternative care, and has willingly asked to end their life or requested access to the means to do so.\n\nThis argument is disputed in other parts of the world. For example, in the state of Louisiana, giving advice or supplying the means to end a person's life is considered a criminal act and can be charged as a felony. In state courts, this crime is comparable to manslaughter. The same laws apply in the states of Mississippi and Nebraska.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/michstate/reader.action?docID=10021934|title=Euthanasia, Ethics and Public Policy: an Argument against Legislation|last=Keown|first=John|date=2002|website=Protest ebrary|access-date=}}{{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\n==Informed consent==\n{{Main|Informed consent}}\n{{more citations needed|section|date=November 2018}}\nInformed consent in ethics usually refers to the idea that a person must be fully informed about and understand the potential benefits and risks of their choice of treatment. A correlate to \"informed consent\" is the concept of [[informed refusal]]. An uninformed person is at risk of mistakenly making a choice not reflective of his or her values or wishes. It does not specifically mean the process of obtaining consent, or the specific legal requirements, which vary from place to place, for capacity to consent. Patients can elect to make their own medical decisions or can delegate decision-making authority to another party. If the patient is incapacitated, laws around the world designate different processes for obtaining informed consent, typically by having a person appointed by the patient or their [[next of kin]] make decisions for them. The value of informed consent is closely related to the values of [[autonomy]] and truth telling.\n\n==Confidentiality==\n{{Further|Confidentiality}}\n[[Confidentiality]] is commonly applied to conversations between doctors and patients. This concept is commonly known as patient-physician privilege. Legal protections prevent physicians from revealing their discussions with patients, even under oath in court.\n\nConfidentiality is mandated in the United States by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 known as [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]], specifically the Privacy Rule, and various state laws, some more rigorous than HIPAA. However, numerous exceptions to the rules have been carved out over the years. For example, many states require physicians to report gunshot wounds to the police and impaired drivers to the [[Department of Motor Vehicles]]. Confidentiality is also challenged in cases involving the diagnosis of a sexually transmitted disease in a patient who refuses to reveal the diagnosis to a spouse, and in the termination of a pregnancy in an underage patient, without the knowledge of the patient's parents.

[[The American Medical Association (AMA)]] states that medical websites have the responsibility to ensure the health care privacy of online visitors and protect patient records from being marketed and monetized into the hands of insurance companies, employers, and marketers. [[Medical ethics#cite note-40|[40]]] With the rapid unification of healthcare, business practices, computer science and e-commerce to create these online diagnostic websites, efforts to maintain health care system's ethical confidentiality standard need to keep up as well. Over the next few years, the Department of Health and Human Services have stated that they will be working towards lawfully protecting the online privacy and digital transfers of patient Electronic Medical Records (EMR) under The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). [[Medical ethics#cite note-41|[41]]]\n\n==Control and resolution==\nTo ensure that appropriate ethical values are being applied within hospitals, effective [[hospital accreditation]] requires that ethical considerations are taken into account, for example with respect to physician integrity, [[conflict of interest]], research ethics and [[organ transplantation]] ethics.\n\n===Guidelines===\nThere is much documentation of the history and necessity of the Declaration of Helsinki. The first code of conduct for research including medical ethics was the Nuremberg Code. This document had large ties to Nazi war crimes, as it was introduced in 1947, so it didn't make much of a difference in terms of regulating practice. This issue called for the creation of the Declaration. There are some stark differences between the Nuremberg Code and the Declaration of Helsinki, including the way it is written. Nuremberg was written in a very concise manner, with a simple explanation. The Declaration of Helsinki is written with a thorough explanation in mind and including many specific commentaries.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Goodyear|first=Micheal D.E|date=2007|title=The Declaration of Helsinki|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=335|issue=7621|pages=624\u20135|id={{ProQuest|1777992607}}|doi=10.1136/bmj.39339.610000.BE|pmid=17901471|pmc=1995496}}</ref>\n\nIn the United Kingdom, [[General Medical Council]] provides clear overall modern guidance in the form of its 'Good Medical Practice' statement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gmc-uk.org/guidance/good_medical_practice/index.asp |title=Good medical practice \u2013 GMC |publisher=Gmc-uk.org |accessdate=2018-05-24 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221112745/http://www.gmc-uk.org/guidance/good_medical_practice/index.asp |archivedate=2008-12-21 }}</ref> Other organizations, such as the [[Medical Protection Society]] and a number of university departments, are often consulted by British doctors regarding issues relating to ethics.\n\n===Ethics committees===\nOften, simple communication is not enough to resolve a conflict, and a hospital [[ethics committee]] must convene to decide a complex matter.\n\nThese bodies are composed primarily of healthcare professionals, but may also include [[philosopher]]s, lay people, and [[clergy]] \u2013 indeed, in many parts of the world their presence is considered mandatory in order to provide balance.\n\nWith respect to the expected composition of such bodies in the US, Europe and Australia, the following applies.<ref>[http://www.chrcrm.org/main/modules/pageworks/index.php?page=015&id=231]{{dead link|date=September 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\nU.S. recommendations suggest that Research and Ethical Boards (REBs) should have five or more members, including at least one scientist, one non-scientist, and one person not affiliated with the institution. The REB should include people knowledgeable in the law and standards of practice and professional conduct. Special memberships are advocated for handicapped or disabled concerns, if required by the protocol under review.\n\nThe European Forum for Good Clinical Practice (EFGCP) suggests that REBs include two practicing physicians who share experience in biomedical research and are independent from the institution where the research is conducted; one lay person; one lawyer; and one paramedical professional, e.g. nurse or pharmacist. They recommend that a quorum include both sexes from a wide age range and reflect the cultural make-up of the local community.\n\nThe 1996 Australian Health Ethics Committee recommendations were entitled, \"Membership Generally of Institutional Ethics Committees\". They suggest a chairperson be preferably someone not employed or otherwise connected with the institution. Members should include a person with knowledge and experience in professional care, counseling or treatment of humans; a minister of religion or equivalent, e.g. Aboriginal elder; a layman; a laywoman; a lawyer and, in the case of a hospital-based ethics committee, a nurse.\n</blockquote>\n\nThe assignment of philosophers or religious clerics will reflect the importance attached by the [[society]] to the basic values involved. An example from [[Sweden]] with [[Torbj\u00f6rn T\u00e4nnsj\u00f6]] on a couple of such committees indicates [[secular]] trends gaining influence.\n\n==Cultural concerns==\nCulture differences can create difficult medical ethics problems. Some cultures have [[Spiritualism (beliefs)|spiritual]] or magical theories about the origins and cause of disease, for example, and reconciling these beliefs with the tenets of [[Medicine|Western medicine]] can be very difficult. As different cultures continue to intermingle and more cultures live alongside each other, the healthcare system, which tends to deal with important life events such as birth, death and suffering, increasingly experiences difficult dilemmas that can sometimes lead to cultural clashes and conflict. Efforts to respond in a culturally sensitive manner go hand in hand with a need to distinguish limits to cultural tolerance.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=A Cross-Cultural Dialogue on Health Care Ethics.|last=Coward|first=Harold G.|publisher=Waterloo, Ont : Wilfrid Laurier university Press.|year=1999|isbn=9780889208551|location=Canada|pages=119\u2013126}}</ref>\n\n=== Culture and Language ===\nAs more people from different cultural and religious backgrounds move to other countries, among these, the United States, it is becoming increasingly important to be culturally sensitive to all communities in order to provide the best health care for all people.<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite journal|last=A.

Interpreting a patient's stories or day-to-day activities as opposed to standardizing and collecting patient data may help in acquiring a better sense of what each patient needs, individually, with respect to their illness. Without this background information, many physicians are unable to properly understand the cultural differences that may set two different patients apart, and thus, may diagnose or recommend treatments that are culturally insensitive or inappropriate. In short, patient narrative has the potential for uncovering patient information and preferences that may otherwise be overlooked.\n\n=== Medical humanitarianism ===\nIn order to address the undeserved, uneducated communities in need of nutrition, housing, and healthcare disparities seen in much of the world today, some argue that we must fall back on ethical values in order to create a foundation to move towards a reasonable understanding, which encourages commitment and motivation to improve factors causing premature death as a goal in a global community.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite journal|last=Prah Ruger|first=Jennifer|date=October 2014|title=Good medical ethics, justice and provincial globalism|journal=J Med Ethics|volume=41|issue=1|pages=103\u2013106|jstor=43283237|doi=10.1136/medethics-2014-102356|pmid=25516948}}</ref> Such factors -such as poverty, environment and education- are said to be out of national or individual control and so this commitment is by default a social and communal responsibility placed on global communities that are able to aid others in need.<ref name=\":9\" /> This is based on the framework of 'provincial globalism,' which seeks a world in which all people have the capability to be healthy.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nOne concern regarding the intersection of medical ethics and humanitarian medical aid is how medical assistance can be as harmful as it is helpful to the community being served. One such example being how political forces may control how foreign humanitarian aid can be utilized in the region it is meant to be provided in. This would be congruous in situations where political strife could lead such aid being used in favor of one group over another. Another example of how foreign humanitarian aid can be misused in its intended community includes the possibility of dissonance forming between a foreign humanitarian aid group and the community being served.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wisnewski|first=Jeremy|date=December 2015|title=Perceiving Sympathetically: Moral Perception, Embodiment, and Medical Ethics|doi=10.1007/s10912-015-9349-1|pmid=26164290|journal=Journal of Medical Humanities|volume=36|issue=4|pages=309\u2013319}}</ref> Examples of this could include the relationships being viewed between aid workers, style of dress, or the lack of education regarding local culture and customs.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Asgary, Junck|first=Ramin, Emily|year=2013|title=New trends of short-term humanitarian medical volunteerism: professional and ethical considerations|url=|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|volume=39|issue=10|pages=625\u2013631|doi=10.1136/medethics-2011-100488|pmid=23236086}}</ref>\n\nHumanitarian practices in areas lacking optimum care can also pause other interesting and difficult ethical dilemmas in terms of beneficence and non-maleficence.

On the other hand, wanting certain procedures done in a specific manner due to religious or cultural belief systems may also occur. The ethical dilemma stems from differences in culture between communities helping those with medical disparities and the societies receiving aid. Women's rights, informed consent and education about health become controversial, as some treatments needed are against societal law, while some cultural traditions involve procedures  against humanitarian efforts.<ref name=\":6\" /> Examples of this are [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM), aiding in [[reinfibulation]], providing sterile equipment in order to perform procedures such as FGM, as well as informing patients of their HIV positive testing.

However, Buddhist teachings support living one's life to the fullest so that through all the suffering which encompasses a large part of what is life, there are no regrets. Buddhism accepts suffering as an inescapable experience, but values happiness and thus values life.<ref name=\":5\" /> Because of this suicide, and euthanasia, are prohibited. However, attempts to rid oneself of any physical or mental pain and suffering are seen as good acts. On the other hand, sedatives and drugs are thought to impair consciousness and awareness in the dying process, which is believed to be of great importance, as it is thought that one's dying consciousness remains and affects new life. Because of this, analgesics must not be part of the dying process, in order for the dying person to be present entirely and pass on their consciousness wholesomely. This can pose significant conflicts during end of life care in Western medical practice.<ref name=\":5\" />\n[[File:Black Taoist symbol.PNG|thumb|Taoist symbol of Yin and Yang]]\n\n==== Chinese Medicine ====\nIn traditional [[Chinese philosophy]],  human life is believed to be connected to nature, which is thought of as the foundation and encompassing force sustaining all of life's phases.<ref name=\":5\" /> Passing and coming of the seasons, life, birth and death are perceived as a cyclic and perpetual occurrences that are believed to be regulated by the principles of [[Yin and yang|''yin'' and ''yang'']]''.'' <ref name=\":5\" /> When one dies, the life-giving material force referred to as ''ch'i'', encompassing both body and spirit, rejoins the material force of the universe and cycles on with respect to the rhythms set forth by ''yin'' and ''yang.''<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nBecause many Chinese people believe that circulation of both physical and 'psychic energy' is important to stay health, procedures which require surgery as well as donations and trans-plantations of organs are seen as a loss of ''ch'i'' , resulting in the loss of someone's vital energy supporting their consciousness and purpose in their lives. Furthermore, a person is never seen as a single unit but rather as a source of relationship, interconnected in a social web.<ref name=\":5\" /> Thus, it is believed that what makes a human one of us is relatedness and communication and family is seen as the basic unit of a community.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":12\">{{Cite journal|last=Ahmed|first=Furqaan|date=August 2013|title=Are medical ethics universal or culture specific|journal=World Journal of Gastrointestinal Pharmacology and Therapeutics|volume=4|issue=3|pages=47\u201348|pmc=3729866|pmid=23919215|doi=10.4292/wjgpt.v4.i3.47}}</ref> This can greatly affect the way medical decisions are made among family members, as diagnoses are not always expected to be announced to the dying or sick, the elderly are expected to be cared for and represented by their children and physicians are expected to act in a paternalistic way.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":12\" /> In short, informed consent as well as patient privacy can be difficult to enforce when dealing with Confucian families.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nFurthermore, some Chinese people may be inclined to continue futile treatment in order to extend life and allow for fulfillment of the practice of benevolence and humanity.<ref name=\":5\" /> In contrast, patients with strong [[Taoism|Daoist]] beliefs may see death as an obstacle and dying as a reunion with nature that should be accepted, and are therefore less likely to ask for treatment of an irreversible condition.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==== Islamic culture and medicine ====\nSome believe Islamic medical ethics and framework remain poorly understood by many working in healthcare.

Out of the many disciplines in current medicine, there are studies that have been conducted in order to ascertain the occurrence of Doctor-Patient sexual misconduct. Results from those studies appear to indicate that certain disciplines are more likely to be offenders than others. Psychiatrists and Obstetrician-Gynecologists for example, are two disciplines noted for having a higher rate of sexual misconduct.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Collier|first=Roger|date=March 2016|title=When the doctor-patient relationship turns sexual|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=AONE&id=GALE&#124;A444400220&v=2.1&it=r&sid=summon&authCount=1|journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal|volume=188|issue=4|pages=247\u2013248|doi=10.1503/cmaj.109-5230|pmid=26858353|pmc=4771530}}</ref> The violation of ethical conduct between doctors and patients also has an association with the age and sex of doctor and patient.

Some of these cases are examined in court.\n\nAdvance directives include [[living wills]] and durable [[power of attorney|powers of attorney]] for health care. (''See also [[Do Not Resuscitate]] and [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]]'') In many cases, the \"expressed wishes\" of the patient are documented in these directives, and this provides a framework to guide family members and [[health care]] professionals in the decision-making process when the patient is incapacitated. Undocumented expressed wishes can also help guide decisions in the absence of advance directives, as in the [[Quinlan case]] in Missouri.\n\n\"Substituted judgment\" is the concept that a family member can give consent for treatment if the patient is unable (or unwilling) to give consent themselves. The key question for the decision-making surrogate is not, \"What would you like to do?\", but instead, \"What do you think the patient would want in this situation?\".\n\nCourts have supported family's arbitrary definitions of futility to include simple biological survival, as in the [[Baby K]] case (in which the courts ordered a child born with only a brain stem instead of a complete brain to be kept on a ventilator based on the religious belief that all life must be preserved).\n\n[[Baby Doe Law]] establishes state protection for a disabled child's right to life, ensuring that this right is protected even over the wishes of parents or guardians in cases where they want to withhold treatment.\n\n==See also==\n{{col div|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Applied ethics]]\n* [[Bioethics]]\n* ''[[The Citadel (novel)|The Citadel]]''\n* ''[[Clinical Ethics]]''\n* [[Clinical governance]]\n* [[Do not resuscitate]]\n* [[Empathy]]\n* [[Ethical code]]\n* [[Ethics of circumcision]]\n* [[Euthanasia]]\n* [[Evidence-based medical ethics]]\n* [[Fee splitting]]\n* [[Hastings Center]]\n* [[Health ethics]]\n* [[Hippocratic Oath]]\n* [[Human radiation experiments]]\n* [[Islamic bioethics]]\n* [[Jewish medical ethics]]\n* [[Joint Commission International]], JCI\n* [[MacLean Center for Clinical Medical Ethics]]\n* [[Medical Code of Ethics]]\n* [[Medical Law International]]\n* [[Medical law]]\n* [[Medical torture]]\n** [[Pharmacological torture]]\n* [[Military medical ethics]]\n* [[Nursing ethics]]\n* [[Patient abuse]]\n* [[Philosophy of Healthcare]]\n* [[Political abuse of psychiatry]]\n* [[Project MKULTRA]]\n* [[Research ethics consultation]]\n* [[Resources for clinical ethics consultation]]\n* [[Right to health]]\n* [[Seven Sins of Medicine]]\n* [[U.S. patients' bill of rights]]\n* [[UN Principles of Medical Ethics]]\n* [[Unethical human experimentation]]\n* [[World Medical Association]]\n{{colend}}\n\n===Reproductive medicine===\n* [[Abortion]] / [[Abortion debate]]\n* [[Eugenics]]\n* [[Gene splicing]]\n* [[Human cloning]]\n* [[Human genetic engineering]]\n* [[Human trafficking]]\n\n===Medical research===\n{{col div|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Animal testing]]\n* [[Children in clinical research]]\n* [[CIOMS Guidelines]]\n* [[Clinical equipoise|Clinical Equipoise]]\n* [[Clinical research ethics]]\n* [[Declaration of Geneva]]\n* [[Declaration of Helsinki]]\n* [[Declaration of Tokyo]]\n* [[Ethical problems using children in clinical trials]]\n* [[First-in-man study]]\n* [[Good clinical practice]]\n* [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]]\n* [[Institutional Review Board]]\n* [[Nuremberg Code]]\n* [[Research ethics consultation]]\n* [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==Sources and references==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n*Beauchamp, Tom L., and Childress, James F. 2001.

The railway station serves the town of Parkes and was built from 1881 to 1893. It is also known as the '''Parkes Railway Station group'''. The property is owned by [[RailCorp]], an [[government agency|agency]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]]. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.<ref name=nswshr-1220>{{cite NSW SHR|5012129|Parkes Railway Station group|hr=01220|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nA railway Shop Order was issued on 7 December 1912 for the construction of a 'permanent \"Rest House\" at Parkes (Enginemans or crew barracks). This reference indicates that a \"temporary\" Rest House or Barracks was provided there much earlier, more likely at or near the time of opening, in the 1898 period. The style of barracks usually provided in the 1890s, up until the early 1900s at many locations in the state, usually consisted of what was known as 'Engine Driver's' and \"Guards Accommodation\". These buildings were of a railway standards design and resembled a moderately -sized hip roofed cottage. They usually had two or three bedrooms at the front of the building, a kitchen and meal room toward the rear, with a bathroom and laundry at the rear. The toilet was usually a separate building out in the yard. In this situation, a train crew (driver, fireman and guard) would all sleep in the one room, three iron bedsteads being provided. These buildings were provided at many locations at the time, and it was quite likely that one was built at Parkes, and remained there until the 1911 period. No evidence of the location of any such temporary structure was found at or near the present barracks building.<ref name=nswshr-1220/>\n\nThe Parkes station opened on 18 December 1893.<ref>[http://www.nswrail.net/locations/show.php?name=NSW:Parkes&line=NSW:main_north:0 Parkes Station] NSWrail.net</ref>\n\nParkes is the junction point for the [[Broken Hill railway line|Broken Hill]], [[Stockinbingal\u2013Parkes railway line|Stockingbingal-Parkes]] and [[Parkes\u2013Narromine railway line|Parkes-Narromine]] lines, the latter two form a cross country route between [[Cootamundra railway station|Cootamundra]] on the [[Main Southern railway line, New South Wales|Main South line]], and [[Werris Creek railway station|Werris Creek]] on the [[Main North railway line, New South Wales|Main North line]].

Originally the building was a five-room gabled building which featured a central waiting room with a Station Master's office and parcel office to the western side flanked by a shed and lamp room wing, with a ladies and gents waiting room to the east flanked by a bathroom wing. Historic plans show three brick [[chimneys]] and gablet vents and a front [[veranda]]h to the entry which all still exist. Timber [[finial]]s to [[gable]] ends still exist on the original detached wings.<ref name=nswshr-1220/>\n\nThe building underwent alterations in 1926 and further alterations in 1947 which extended the building to either end to incorporate the previous external wings in to the form of the main building and also altering the use of most rooms. The extensions were undertaken in a sympathetic manner including matching windows and an extended platform [[awning]] to match the existing. As such the building presents as a cohesive building that still retains its Victorian character. The brick platform dates from 1893 and was extended {{circa|1928}} and features modern asphalt surfacing.<ref name=nswshr-1220/>\n\n;Railway refreshment rooms ({{circa|1928}})\nFrom historic plans it appears prior to the current building being erected on this site, that there were previously two small structures used as temporary Railway Refreshment rooms and accommodation for the staff. In 1923, a {{convert|12|by|6|m|adj=on}} marquee built of Birkmyre cloth with framing and flooring was erected as a refreshment room.<ref name=nswshr-1220-1747>Forsyth, 2008</ref><ref name=nswshr-1220/>\n\nPlans from {{circa|1928}} show the demolition of the previous structures and the erection of the existing brick building on the same site. Further historic plans show minor alterations in 1939 and a further extension to the west in 1943. The building is unusual in that it appears to be composed of two different buildings with a gabled part fronting on to the platform with a cantilevered awning, and a rear kitchen wing with a brick [[parapet]] with projecting string course.<ref name=nswshr-1220/>\n\n;Signal Box (1944)\nTwo-storey elevated fibro signal box with low [[Hipped roof|hipped]] pyramid roof clad in concrete tiles.

The railway station serves the town of Parkes and was built from 1881 to 1893. It is also known as the '''Parkes Railway Station group'''. The property is owned by [[RailCorp]], an [[government agency|agency]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]]. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.<ref name=nswshr-1220>{{cite NSW SHR|5012129|Parkes Railway Station group|hr=01220|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nA railway Shop Order was issued on 7 December 1912 for the construction of a 'permanent \"Rest House\" at Parkes (Enginemans or crew barracks). This reference indicates that a \"temporary\" Rest House or Barracks was provided there much earlier, more likely at or near the time of opening, in the 1898 period. The style of barracks usually provided in the 1890s, up until the early 1900s at many locations in the state, usually consisted of what was known as 'Engine Driver's' and \"Guards Accommodation\". These buildings were of a railway standards design and resembled a moderately -sized hip roofed cottage. They usually had two or three bedrooms at the front of the building, a kitchen and meal room toward the rear, with a bathroom and laundry at the rear. The toilet was usually a separate building out in the yard. In this situation, a train crew (driver, fireman and guard) would all sleep in the one room, three iron bedsteads being provided. These buildings were provided at many locations at the time, and it was quite likely that one was built at Parkes, and remained there until the 1911 period. No evidence of the location of any such temporary structure was found at or near the present barracks building.<ref name=nswshr-1220/>\n\nThe Parkes station opened on 18 December 1893.<ref>[http://www.nswrail.net/locations/show.php?name=NSW:Parkes&line=NSW:main_north:0 Parkes Station] NSWrail.net</ref>\n\nParkes is the junction point for the [[Broken Hill railway line|Broken Hill]], [[Stockinbingal\u2013Parkes railway line|Stockingbingal-Parkes]] and [[Parkes\u2013Narromine railway line|Parkes-Narromine]] lines, the latter two form a cross country route between [[Cootamundra railway station|Cootamundra]] on the [[Main Southern railway line, New South Wales|Main South line]], and [[Werris Creek railway station|Werris Creek]] on the [[Main North railway line, New South Wales|Main North line]].

Originally the building was a five-room gabled building which featured a central waiting room with a Station Master's office and parcel office to the western side flanked by a shed and lamp room wing, with a ladies and gents waiting room to the east flanked by a bathroom wing. Historic plans show three brick [[chimneys]] and gablet vents and a front [[veranda]]h to the entry which all still exist. Timber [[finial]]s to [[gable]] ends still exist on the original detached wings.<ref name=nswshr-1220/>\n\nThe building underwent alterations in 1926 and further alterations in 1947 which extended the building to either end to incorporate the previous external wings in to the form of the main building and also altering the use of most rooms. The extensions were undertaken in a sympathetic manner including matching windows and an extended platform [[awning]] to match the existing. As such the building presents as a cohesive building that still retains its Victorian character. The brick platform dates from 1893 and was extended {{circa|1928}} and features modern asphalt surfacing.<ref name=nswshr-1220/>\n\n;Railway refreshment rooms ({{circa|1928}})\nFrom historic plans it appears prior to the current building being erected on this site, that there were previously two small structures used as temporary Railway Refreshment rooms and accommodation for the staff. In 1923, a {{convert|12|by|6|m|adj=on}} marquee built of Birkmyre cloth with framing and flooring was erected as a refreshment room.<ref name=nswshr-1220-1747>Forsyth, 2008</ref><ref name=nswshr-1220/>\n\nPlans from {{circa|1928}} show the demolition of the previous structures and the erection of the existing brick building on the same site. Further historic plans show minor alterations in 1939 and a further extension to the west in 1943. The building is unusual in that it appears to be composed of two different buildings with a gabled part fronting on to the platform with a cantilevered awning, and a rear kitchen wing with a brick [[parapet]] with projecting string course.<ref name=nswshr-1220/>\n\n;Signal Box (1944)\nTwo-storey elevated fibro signal box with low [[Hipped roof|hipped]] pyramid roof clad in concrete tiles.

Before the end of the decade, heavy metal fans became known as \"[[Heavy metal subculture|metalheads]]\" or \"[[headbanging|headbangers]]\", and there were festivals worldwide, both touring and stationary, dedicated to [[heavy metal subgenres]] and heavy metal itself. During the 1980s, [[glam metal]] became a commercial force, while [[Underground music|Underground scenes]] and [[extreme metal|extreme subgenres of metal]] such as [[death metal]] and [[black metal]] remained [[subculture|subcultural]] phenomena, though they have their own dedicated festivals as well.

Before the end of the decade, heavy metal fans became known as \"[[Heavy metal subculture|metalheads]]\" or \"[[headbanging|headbangers]]\", and there were festivals worldwide, both touring and stationary, dedicated to [[heavy metal subgenres]] and heavy metal itself. During the 1980s, [[glam metal]] became a commercial force, while [[Underground music|Underground scenes]] and [[extreme metal|extreme subgenres of metal]] such as [[death metal]] and [[black metal]] remained [[subculture|subcultural]] phenomena, though they have their own dedicated festivals as well.

After performing for five months in a stock company in Fargo, North Dakota, she began working in [[vaudeville]].<ref name=INPerspective/><ref name=Smith168/>\n\n===Stage actress===\nIn the mid-1910s Main appeared in several plays, which included touring in\n''Cheating Cheaters '' with [[John Barrymore]] in 1916. She also debuted in the [[Broadway theatre]] in ''Yes or No'' in 1918. In addition, Main returned to vaudeville to perform at the [[Palace Theatre (New York City)|Palace Theater]] in a skit called ''The Family Ford'' with comedian [[W. C. Fields]]. Not all of the early plays in which she appeared were a success. ''A House Divided'' closed in 1923 after just one performance, but Main continued to find work on the Broadway stage. In 1927 she played [[Mae West]]'s mother in ''The Wicked Age'', and in 1928 played opposite [[Barbara Stanwyck]] in the long-running stage hit ''Burlesque''. Main also appeared in several other Broadway productions: ''Salvation'' in 1928, ''[[Scarlet Sister Mary]]'' in 1930, ''Ebb Tide'' in 1931, ''Music in the Air'' in 1932, and in ''Jackson White''.<ref name=Henricks34/><ref name=Smith168/>\n\nOne of Main's best-known stage performances was in 1935's ''Dead End'' as Mrs. Martin, the mother of a gangster, Baby Face Martin. Main played the role in 460 performances before leaving the show in 1936 to play the character of Lucy, a  hotel-keeper/dude-ranch operator, in ''The Women''. Main re-created these two roles in film versions of the plays in 1937 and 1939 respectively.<ref name=Henricks35>Henricks, p. 35.</ref><ref name=Smith169-70>Smith, pp. 169\u201370.</ref>\n\n===Film career===\nOne of Main's first feature  film appearances was as an extra in ''[[A House Divided (1931 film)|A House Divided]]'' (1931).<ref name=INPerspective/><ref name=Price/><ref>{{cite book|author=Barry Monush |title=Screen World Presents the Encyclopedia of Hollywood Film Actors: From the Silent Era to 1965|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation |year=2003 |pages=458 |isbn=1-55783-551-9}}</ref> She also appeared in ''Take A Chance'' and ''Crime Without Passion'' (1934), and re-created her stage role as a servant in the film version of ''Music in the Air'' (1934), but most of her performance was cut from the film.

She completed a three-year course of study in 1909 at the age of nineteen.

Main's husband was a widower with a grown daughter named Annabelle. Main accompanied her husband on the lecture circuit, handling the details of their life on the road.

In addition, Main returned to vaudeville to perform at the [[Palace Theatre (New York City)|Palace Theater]] in a skit called ''The Family Ford'' with comedian [[W. C. Fields]]. Not all of the early plays in which she appeared were a success. ''A House Divided'' closed in 1923 after just one performance, but Main continued to find work on the Broadway stage. In 1927 she played [[Mae West]]'s mother in ''The Wicked Age'', and in 1928 played opposite [[Barbara Stanwyck]] in the long-running stage hit ''Burlesque''.
