He is voiced by [[Santino Fontana]] in the film.\n\nHans is the thirteenth prince of the Southern Isles. Knowing that he will be unable to inherit the throne of his own country, he concocts a scheme to usurp the throne of another country through marriage. Although he is portrayed as honest and noble throughout most of the film, he is later revealed to be deceptive, calculating, and cruel in nature.\n\nHans' villainy is a plot twist in ''Frozen'', revealed in the film's final act. Despite the acclaim that the film has received, Hans' betrayal has been the subject of mixed reception from some critics.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} While the character's mastery of trickery and Fontana's performance have been praised, Hans' villainous reveal has been criticized for being too upsetting and confusing for the film's younger viewers. However, others have considered the character's shift in personality to be a valuable lesson that children can learn from.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Development==\n\n===Origins and concept===\nThe Disney studio made their first attempts to adapt Hans Christian Andersen's fairytale, ''The Snow Queen'', as early as 1943, when [[Walt Disney]] considered the possibilities to produce a biography film of the author.<ref name=\"Jim Hill\">{{cite news|url=http://jimhillmedia.com/editor_in_chief1/b/jim_hill/archive/2013/10/18/countdown-to-disney-quot-frozen-quot-how-one-simple-suggestion-broke-the-ice-on-the-quot-snow-queen-quot-s-decades-long-story-problems.aspx#.UmbFXxZPrTQ|title=Countdown to Disney \"Frozen\" : How one simple suggestion broke the ice on the \"Snow Queen\"'s decades-long story problems|first=Jim|last=Hill|work=The [[Los Angeles Times]]|date=October 18, 2013|accessdate=February 21, 2014}}</ref> However, the story and the [[Character (arts)|characters]] proved to be too symbolic<ref name=geekmom>{{cite news|last=White|first=Cindy|title=Inside Disney's Frozen: Q&A with the Directors|url=http://geekmom.com/2013/10/disneys-frozen-directors-interview/|accessdate=21 February 2014|newspaper=Geek Mom|date=October 11, 2013}}</ref> and implicit<ref>{{cite news|last=Wright|first=Gary|title=Frozen in Time: Disney's Adaptation of a Literary Classic|url=http://www.rotoscopers.com/2013/11/24/frozen-in-time-disneys-adaptation-of-a-literary-classic/|accessdate=21 February 2014|newspaper=Rotoscoper|date=November 24, 2013}}</ref> that they posed unsolvable problems to Disney and his animators.

undergoes a transformation (e.g. [[Aladdin (Disney character)|Aladdin]] goes from street rat to prince, [[Cinderella (Disney character)|Cinderella]] from servant to princess). In ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'', Hans goes from a courtly charmer to power-hungry villain. According to Hyrum Osmond, one of the supervising animators for Hans, Hans initially appears as a handsome, dashing character. The crew wanted the audience to fall in love with him and the relationship he could have with [[Anna (Frozen)|Anna]]. Then they'd got to turn him around towards the climax and make it a big shock. According to Lino Di Salvo, Hans is a chameleon who adapts to any environment to make the other characters comfortable. And one of the biggest challenges in designing Hans, according to Bill Schwab, character design supervisor, was to make sure that they covered all aspects of his personality without fully tipping their hand to the audience. He shares similar personalities with various Disney villains: Notably, Lady Tremaine for the way he treats Anna near the climax of the end. He shares Ratigan from ''[[The Great Mouse Detective]]'', Frollo from ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'', Scar from ''[[The Lion King]]'', and Jafar from ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', intentions for wanting to murder their respective rulers and install themselves as king (which only Ratigan, Frollo and Hans was able to almost fulfill, while Jafar decided he would force Jasmine to marry him and not kill her. On the other hand, Scar had succeeded in killing Mufasa and taking over as king until he was finally foiled by Simba who forced his confession during their fight). He shares similarities to [[Gaston (Beauty and the Beast)|Gaston]] from ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' in which they were the youngest villains to appear and having the towns fall in love with them. However, the main difference is that [[Belle (Beauty and the Beast)|Belle]] quickly saw Gaston for who he is and distrusted him, whereas Hans gained Anna's trust before betraying her. Afterwards, he left a lasting and negative impact on Anna when she realizes that the warning Elsa, and later [[Kristoff (Frozen)|Kristoff]], originally gave her about falling in love with someone she just met was true.\n\nHyrum Osmond, one of the film's supervising animators, later revealed that during the \"[[Love Is an Open Door]]\" musical sequence, a brief moment where Hans, belting out a high note under a waterfall, closes his eyes and raises his arm, was a parody of a signature move by [[Donny Osmond]], of whom Hyrum is a nephew.<ref>{{cite news|last=McDaniel|first=Matt|title='Frozen' Secret Reference (With a Famous Family Connection) Revealed|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/blogs/movie-news/frozen-exclusive-clip-love-is-an-open-door-donny-osmond-tribute-165833344.html|accessdate=April 8, 2014|newspaper=Yahoo! Movies|date=March 18, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===''Frozen''===\n{{Main article|Frozen (2013 film)}}\nOnce the Southern Isles is given word of Queen Elsa's coronation, Hans is the royal representative that attends in honor of his country. Along with the other invited royalty, he arrives on the day of the event and is first seen arriving in Arendelle on his horse, Sitron, who accidentally runs into Princess Anna when she crashes into his horse, and falls into a rowboat. Using grace and charm, Hans immediately woos the lovesick princess, with Anna almost immediately falling for him due to his wondrous looks and undeniable charisma. Moments later, Hans attends Queen Elsa's crowning, waving to Anna as he watches alongside the other visiting royals and dignitaries. Later on that night, a ball is held in honor of the new queen and Hans appears at the celebration party, soon finding and inviting Anna for a romantic waltz after coincidentally bumping into her once again.\n\nDuring their time together, Hans learns of Anna's longing of having someone special in her life, with her sister apparently developing a dislike of being around her by suddenly shutting Anna out one day when they were kids, to which Hans openly relates to, only furthering Anna's connection with him. And with this, Hans promises to never shut Anna out, unlike Elsa, much to the princess' absolute joy. By the end of their tour, Hans works up the courage to propose, with Anna agreeing in a heartbeat. The two head back to the royal throne room, where the party is being held, to ask for Elsa's blessing. Elsa coldly refuses, denying Anna marrying someone she just met, and subsequently ends the party. Suspecting he has an ulterior motive for wanting to marry Anna, she orders Hans to leave out of frustration. Heartbroken, Anna confronts her sister, but this accidentally exposes Elsa's abilities to conjure up ice and snow, much to Hans' shock, along with everyone else's. The Duke of Weselton immediately declares Elsa a monster, and orders his men to capture her. Elsa flees, accidentally causing an eternal winter over Arendelle while doing so, with Anna and Hans chasing after her until she runs across the surface of the fjord. Anna volunteers to go after Elsa, but Hans objects to her going by herself, considering it too dangerous. However, Anna insists that Hans stay behind to take care of Arendelle during her absence, to which the prince eventually agrees.\n\nIt does not take long for Arendelle to turn into an icy wasteland. However, through it all, Hans proved to be a worthy ruler, winning the hearts of Arendelle's citizens, gaining their trust and loyalty through his seemingly benevolent and caring ways. Hans does so by distributing free cloaks to the public and setting up soup lines in the palace. The Duke of Weselton is furious that Hans is giving away Arendelle's tradeable goods. Scolding Hans, the Duke then openly expresses his suspicion over Anna and Elsa, believing they're conspiring together to doom them all. Hans immediately snaps and threatens to punish the Duke for treason if he doesn't silence himself. Just then, Anna's horse returns, riderless, making Hans believe Anna is in danger. With the royal guards and the Duke's men, Hans leads a rescue mission for Anna and a hunt for Elsa.\n\nA few days later, the army arrives at Elsa's ice palace. As they are approaching the front steps, Elsa's snowlem bouncer, Marshmallow, disguised as a pile of snow by the staircase, suddenly attacks him. While Hans and his army battle Marshmallow, the Duke's two guards make their way inside to take on Elsa. Hans manages to defeat Marshmallow by slicing his leg off, sending him plunging into a gorge. With him out of the way, Hans and the others rush inside to find Anna, but she is nowhere in sight. Instead, they find Elsa merely seconds away from killing the Duke's two guards. Hans is able to stop her, freeing the two thugs. However, one of the thugs attempts to shoot her with his bolt, but Hans interferes and causes the bolt to shoot upward and shatter the hook on a massive [[chandelier]], which crashes down and manages to knock Elsa unconscious. Captured, Elsa is imprisoned in Arendelle's dungeon. Hans decides to pay Elsa a visit, asking her to put an end to the winter. However, Elsa confesses she has no idea how and asks to be released. Hans claims he will do what he can.\n\nAnna suddenly returns and desperately begs Hans for a kiss. The two are given privacy, Anna explains that during her journey, Elsa froze her heart, and only an act of true love can save her from freezing to death. However, Hans smirks, revealing his true colors and rejects Anna. Confused, Anna tries to understand what's going on, but Hans simply explains his entire plot to marry her, arrange an \"accident\" for Elsa, and become king of Arendelle through marriage. Anna tries to stop him, but she is far too weak. After informing her his next move is to kill Elsa and bring back summer, Hans leaves Anna to die, locking the door and trapping her within to prevent others from finding her or prevent her from escaping and interfering. Hans then returns to the Duke and the other dignitaries. He tells them Anna was killed by Elsa, but is unaware that Olaf foiled him by helping Anna escape. He sentences Elsa to death for high treason.\n\nMeanwhile, through her magic, Elsa manages to escape her cell by freezing her shackles until they become so brittle that they break, then freezing the wall of her cell until it collapses. Hans chases after her into the frozen fjords as a harsh blizzard consumes the kingdom. He eventually stumbles upon her, and claims to her she cannot escape all the horrible things she has already done. Elsa pleads for mercy, and asks him to take care of her sister for her, to which Hans responds by telling her that Anna has died from Elsa freezing her heart (or so Hans thinks, since Olaf has found Anna and helped her escape). Elsa collapses, and whilst she is distracted, Hans pulls out his sword and prepares to stab her. As he is swinging, Anna suddenly arrives and jumps in front of Hans' sword path, completely freezing solid just before Hans' blade strikes her and shatters. Anna's freezing causes a forceful blast, knocking Hans off his feet and rendering him unconscious.\n\nWhen he awakens several moments later, he finds Arendelle thawed and peace restored. Enraged by what Hans did to Anna and what he was doing to Elsa, Kristoff approaches Hans intending to attack him, but Anna intervenes. Instead, Anna confronts Hans, and the sight of her alive and well confuses Hans, prompting him to ask how she survived the frozen heart curse. She tells him that the only person who has a frozen heart is Hans himself for what he did to her and Elsa. Anna turns her back to him, much to Hans' disbelief, then, in a swift movement, turns around again and punches him in the face and off the side of a ship. Humiliated and defeated, Hans is last seen imprisoned on a ship heading back to the Southern Isles. According to the French dignitary, Hans is set to receive an ultimate (and unspecified) punishment from his older brothers.\n\n===''Frozen Fever''===\nHans briefly makes an appearance in ''[[Frozen Fever]]'' where he is seen cleaning up horse manure in the Southern Isles as part of his punishment from his family in his actions against Queen Elsa and Arendelle. After Elsa sneezes into a large sounding horn, she creates a large snowball that flies over to the Southern Isles and accidentally catapults Hans into a pile of manure, causing all the horses in the stable to laugh at his misfortune.\n\n===''Frozen II''===\nHans is frequently mentioned in ''Frozen II'', and he appears in the snowy manifestations of Elsa's past, where Elsa destroys his figure due to her being bitter at him for his past actions.\n\n===''Kingdom Hearts III''===\nHans appears in two short scenes recreating moments from the film, and has no lines. He first appears dragging an unconscious Elsa back to the kingdom for execution, where Sora notes an extreme amount of darkness within him and expresses willingness to kill him if it means saving Elsa and protecting Arendelle from further harm. Hans appears later on trying to kill Elsa, which Anna stops by coming between them and freezing, knocking Hans to the ground as in the film. The scene then diverges from canon, with Hans being consumed by his own darkness and giving birth to a wolf-shaped Heartless called [[Skoll]] which serves as the world's main boss. Hans dies when Skoll is defeated, leaving him eternally banished to the Realm of Darkness, a fate shared with [[Mother Gothel]] and [[Cinderella (1950 film)|the Tremaine family]]\n\n==Reception==\nWhile the film has largely received critical acclaim,<ref>{{cite news|last=Barnes|first=Brooks|title=Boys Don't Run Away From These Princesses|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/02/movies/frozen-disneys-new-fairy-tale-is-no-2-at-box-office.html?_r=0|accessdate=2 December 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=1 December 2013}}</ref> critics were divided on the reveal of Hans' duplicity. Gina Dalfonzo from ''[[The Atlantic]]'' questioned the reveal's age-appropriateness, saying, \"Children will, in their lifetimes, necessarily learn that not everyone who looks or seems trustworthy is trustworthy\u2014but ''Frozen'''s big twist is a needlessly upsetting way to teach that lesson.\"<ref>{{cite news | last=Dalfonzo|first=Gina|title=Frozen's Cynical Twist on Prince Charming|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/12/-em-frozen-em-s-cynical-twist-on-prince-charming/282204/|accessdate=10 March 2014|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=10 December 2013}}</ref> Other critics disagreed - Melissa Leon from ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' said, \"Anna is being ridiculous.

He is voiced by [[Santino Fontana]] in the film.\n\nHans is the thirteenth prince of the Southern Isles. Knowing that he will be unable to inherit the throne of his own country, he concocts a scheme to usurp the throne of another country through marriage. Although he is portrayed as honest and noble throughout most of the film, he is later revealed to be deceptive, calculating, and cruel in nature.\n\nHans' villainy is a plot twist in ''Frozen'', revealed in the film's final act. Despite the acclaim that the film has received, Hans' betrayal has been the subject of mixed reception from some critics. While the character's mastery of trickery and Fontana's performance have been praised, Hans' villainous reveal has been criticized for being too upsetting and confusing for the film's younger viewers. However, others have considered the character's shift in personality to be a valuable lesson that children can learn from.\n\n==Development==\n\n===Origins and concept===\nThe Disney studio made their first attempts to adapt Hans Christian Andersen's fairytale, ''The Snow Queen'', as early as 1943, when [[Walt Disney]] considered the possibilities to produce a biography film of the author.<ref name=\"Jim Hill\">{{cite news|url=http://jimhillmedia.com/editor_in_chief1/b/jim_hill/archive/2013/10/18/countdown-to-disney-quot-frozen-quot-how-one-simple-suggestion-broke-the-ice-on-the-quot-snow-queen-quot-s-decades-long-story-problems.aspx#.UmbFXxZPrTQ|title=Countdown to Disney \"Frozen\" : How one simple suggestion broke the ice on the \"Snow Queen\"'s decades-long story problems|first=Jim|last=Hill|work=The [[Los Angeles Times]]|date=October 18, 2013|accessdate=February 21, 2014}}</ref> However, the story and the [[Character (arts)|characters]] proved to be too symbolic<ref name=geekmom>{{cite news|last=White|first=Cindy|title=Inside Disney's Frozen: Q&A with the Directors|url=http://geekmom.com/2013/10/disneys-frozen-directors-interview/|accessdate=21 February 2014|newspaper=Geek Mom|date=October 11, 2013}}</ref> and implicit<ref>{{cite news|last=Wright|first=Gary|title=Frozen in Time: Disney's Adaptation of a Literary Classic|url=http://www.rotoscopers.com/2013/11/24/frozen-in-time-disneys-adaptation-of-a-literary-classic/|accessdate=21 February 2014|newspaper=Rotoscoper|date=November 24, 2013}}</ref> that they posed unsolvable problems to Disney and his animators.

undergoes a transformation (e.g. [[Aladdin (Disney character)|Aladdin]] goes from street rat to prince, [[Cinderella (Disney character)|Cinderella]] from servant to princess). In ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'', Hans goes from a courtly charmer to power-hungry villain. According to Hyrum Osmond, one of the supervising animators for Hans, Hans initially appears as a handsome, dashing character. The crew wanted the audience to fall in love with him and the relationship he could have with [[Anna (Frozen)|Anna]]. Then they'd got to turn him around towards the climax and make it a big shock. According to Lino Di Salvo, Hans is a chameleon who adapts to any environment to make the other characters comfortable. And one of the biggest challenges in designing Hans, according to Bill Schwab, character design supervisor, was to make sure that they covered all aspects of his personality without fully tipping their hand to the audience. He shares similar personalities with various Disney villains: Notably, Lady Tremaine for the way he treats Anna near the climax of the end. He shares Ratigan from ''[[The Great Mouse Detective]]'', Frollo from ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'', Scar from ''[[The Lion King]]'', and Jafar from ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', intentions for wanting to murder their respective rulers and install themselves as king (which only Ratigan, Frollo and Hans was able to almost fulfill, while Jafar decided he would force Jasmine to marry him and not kill her. On the other hand, Scar had succeeded in killing Mufasa and taking over as king until he was finally foiled by Simba who forced his confession during their fight). He shares similarities to [[Gaston (Beauty and the Beast)|Gaston]] from ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' in which they were the youngest villains to appear and having the towns fall in love with them. However, the main difference is that [[Belle (Beauty and the Beast)|Belle]] quickly saw Gaston for who he is and distrusted him, whereas Hans gained Anna's trust before betraying her. Afterwards, he left a lasting and negative impact on Anna when she realizes that the warning Elsa, and later [[Kristoff (Frozen)|Kristoff]], originally gave her about falling in love with someone she just met was true.\n\nHyrum Osmond, one of the film's supervising animators, later revealed that during the \"[[Love Is an Open Door]]\" musical sequence, a brief moment where Hans, belting out a high note under a waterfall, closes his eyes and raises his arm, was a parody of a signature move by [[Donny Osmond]], of whom Hyrum is a nephew.<ref>{{cite news|last=McDaniel|first=Matt|title='Frozen' Secret Reference (With a Famous Family Connection) Revealed|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/blogs/movie-news/frozen-exclusive-clip-love-is-an-open-door-donny-osmond-tribute-165833344.html|accessdate=April 8, 2014|newspaper=Yahoo! Movies|date=March 18, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===''Frozen''===\n{{Main article|Frozen (2013 film)}}\nOnce the Southern Isles is given word of Queen Elsa's coronation, Hans is the royal representative that attends in honor of his country. Along with the other invited royalty, he arrives on the day of the event and is first seen arriving in Arendelle on his horse, Sitron, who accidentally runs into Princess Anna when she crashes into his horse, and falls into a rowboat. Using grace and charm, Hans immediately woos the lovesick princess, with Anna almost immediately falling for him due to his wondrous looks and undeniable charisma. Moments later, Hans attends Queen Elsa's crowning, waving to Anna as he watches alongside the other visiting royals and dignitaries. Later on that night, a ball is held in honor of the new queen and Hans appears at the celebration party, soon finding and inviting Anna for a romantic waltz after coincidentally bumping into her once again.\n\nDuring their time together, Hans learns of Anna's longing of having someone special in her life, with her sister apparently developing a dislike of being around her by suddenly shutting Anna out one day when they were kids, to which Hans openly relates to, only furthering Anna's connection with him. And with this, Hans promises to never shut Anna out, unlike Elsa, much to the princess' absolute joy. By the end of their tour, Hans works up the courage to propose, with Anna agreeing in a heartbeat. The two head back to the royal throne room, where the party is being held, to ask for Elsa's blessing. Elsa coldly refuses, denying Anna marrying someone she just met, and subsequently ends the party. Suspecting he has an ulterior motive for wanting to marry Anna, she orders Hans to leave out of frustration. Heartbroken, Anna confronts her sister, but this accidentally exposes Elsa's abilities to conjure up ice and snow, much to Hans' shock, along with everyone else's. The Duke of Weselton immediately declares Elsa a monster, and orders his men to capture her. Elsa flees, accidentally causing an eternal winter over Arendelle while doing so, with Anna and Hans chasing after her until she runs across the surface of the fjord. Anna volunteers to go after Elsa, but Hans objects to her going by herself, considering it too dangerous. However, Anna insists that Hans stay behind to take care of Arendelle during her absence, to which the prince eventually agrees.\n\nIt does not take long for Arendelle to turn into an icy wasteland. However, through it all, Hans proved to be a worthy ruler, winning the hearts of Arendelle's citizens, gaining their trust and loyalty through his seemingly benevolent and caring ways. Hans does so by distributing free cloaks to the public and setting up soup lines in the palace. The Duke of Weselton is furious that Hans is giving away Arendelle's tradeable goods. Scolding Hans, the Duke then openly expresses his suspicion over Anna and Elsa, believing they're conspiring together to doom them all. Hans immediately snaps and threatens to punish the Duke for treason if he doesn't silence himself. Just then, Anna's horse returns, riderless, making Hans believe Anna is in danger. With the royal guards and the Duke's men, Hans leads a rescue mission for Anna and a hunt for Elsa.\n\nA few days later, the army arrives at Elsa's ice palace. As they are approaching the front steps, Elsa's snowlem bouncer, Marshmallow, disguised as a pile of snow by the staircase, suddenly attacks him. While Hans and his army battle Marshmallow, the Duke's two guards make their way inside to take on Elsa. Hans manages to defeat Marshmallow by slicing his leg off, sending him plunging into a gorge. With him out of the way, Hans and the others rush inside to find Anna, but she is nowhere in sight. Instead, they find Elsa merely seconds away from killing the Duke's two guards. Hans is able to stop her, freeing the two thugs. However, one of the thugs attempts to shoot her with his bolt, but Hans interferes and causes the bolt to shoot upward and shatter the hook on a massive [[chandelier]], which crashes down and manages to knock Elsa unconscious. Captured, Elsa is imprisoned in Arendelle's dungeon. Hans decides to pay Elsa a visit, asking her to put an end to the winter. However, Elsa confesses she has no idea how and asks to be released. Hans claims he will do what he can.\n\nAnna suddenly returns and desperately begs Hans for a kiss. The two are given privacy, Anna explains that during her journey, Elsa froze her heart, and only an act of true love can save her from freezing to death. However, Hans smirks, revealing his true colors and rejects Anna. Confused, Anna tries to understand what's going on, but Hans simply explains his entire plot to marry her, arrange an \"accident\" for Elsa, and become king of Arendelle through marriage. Anna tries to stop him, but she is far too weak. After informing her his next move is to kill Elsa and bring back summer, Hans leaves Anna to die, locking the door and trapping her within to prevent others from finding her or prevent her from escaping and interfering. Hans then returns to the Duke and the other dignitaries. He tells them Anna was killed by Elsa, but is unaware that Olaf foiled him by helping Anna escape. He sentences Elsa to death for high treason.\n\nMeanwhile, through her magic, Elsa manages to escape her cell by freezing her shackles until they become so brittle that they break, then freezing the wall of her cell until it collapses. Hans chases after her into the frozen fjords as a harsh blizzard consumes the kingdom. He eventually stumbles upon her, and claims to her she cannot escape all the horrible things she has already done. Elsa pleads for mercy, and asks him to take care of her sister for her, to which Hans responds by telling her that Anna has died from Elsa freezing her heart (or so Hans thinks, since Olaf has found Anna and helped her escape). Elsa collapses, and whilst she is distracted, Hans pulls out his sword and prepares to stab her. As he is swinging, Anna suddenly arrives and jumps in front of Hans' sword path, completely freezing solid just before Hans' blade strikes her and shatters. Anna's freezing causes a forceful blast, knocking Hans off his feet and rendering him unconscious.\n\nWhen he awakens several moments later, he finds Arendelle thawed and peace restored. Enraged by what Hans did to Anna and what he was doing to Elsa, Kristoff approaches Hans intending to attack him, but Anna intervenes. Instead, Anna confronts Hans, and the sight of her alive and well confuses Hans, prompting him to ask how she survived the frozen heart curse. She tells him that the only person who has a frozen heart is Hans himself for what he did to her and Elsa. Anna turns her back to him, much to Hans' disbelief, then, in a swift movement, turns around again and punches him in the face and off the side of a ship. Humiliated and defeated, Hans is last seen imprisoned on a ship heading back to the Southern Isles. According to the French dignitary, Hans is set to receive an ultimate (and unspecified) punishment from his older brothers.\n\n===''Frozen Fever''===\nHans briefly makes an appearance in ''[[Frozen Fever]]'' where he is seen cleaning up horse manure in the Southern Isles as part of his punishment from his family in his actions against Queen Elsa and Arendelle. After Elsa sneezes into a large sounding horn, she creates a large snowball that flies over to the Southern Isles and accidentally catapults Hans into a pile of manure, causing all the horses in the stable to laugh at his misfortune.\n\n===''Frozen II''===\nHans is frequently mentioned in ''Frozen II'', and he appears in the snowy manifestations of Elsa's past, where Elsa destroys his figure due to her being bitter at him for his past actions.\n\n===''Kingdom Hearts III''===\nHans appears in two short scenes recreating moments from the film, and has no lines. He first appears dragging an unconscious Elsa back to the kingdom for execution, where Sora notes an extreme amount of darkness within him and expresses willingness to kill him if it means saving Elsa and protecting Arendelle from further harm. Hans appears later on trying to kill Elsa, which Anna stops by coming between them and freezing, knocking Hans to the ground as in the film. The scene then diverges from canon, with Hans being consumed by his own darkness and giving birth to a wolf-shaped Heartless called [[Skoll]] which serves as the world's main boss. Hans dies when Skoll is defeated, leaving him eternally banished to the Realm of Darkness, a fate shared with [[Mother Gothel]] and [[Cinderella (1950 film)|the Tremaine family]]\n\n==Reception==\nWhile the film has largely received critical acclaim,<ref>{{cite news|last=Barnes|first=Brooks|title=Boys Don't Run Away From These Princesses|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/02/movies/frozen-disneys-new-fairy-tale-is-no-2-at-box-office.html?_r=0|accessdate=2 December 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=1 December 2013}}</ref> critics were divided on the reveal of Hans' duplicity. Gina Dalfonzo from ''[[The Atlantic]]'' questioned the reveal's age-appropriateness, saying, \"Children will, in their lifetimes, necessarily learn that not everyone who looks or seems trustworthy is trustworthy\u2014but ''Frozen'''s big twist is a needlessly upsetting way to teach that lesson.\"<ref>{{cite news | last=Dalfonzo|first=Gina|title=Frozen's Cynical Twist on Prince Charming|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/12/-em-frozen-em-s-cynical-twist-on-prince-charming/282204/|accessdate=10 March 2014|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=10 December 2013}}</ref> Other critics disagreed - Melissa Leon from ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' said, \"Anna is being ridiculous. But unlike ''Snow White'' or ''Sleeping Beauty'', the world of ''Frozen'' knows that.

Poulsbo was founded in the 1880s by Norwegian immigrant J\u00f8rgen Eliason, who was joined by other Scandinavians who relocated from the [[Midwest|Midwestern states]]. They were drawn here by the availability of land, by the area's rich resources, and by a landscape similar to their native home. The settlement was connected by boats to other areas of the region, including the [[Puget Sound mosquito fleet]], which was eventually usurped by highways built in the early 20th century.\n\nModern-day downtown Poulsbo maintains a Scandinavian theme to honor its early immigrant history and is a popular regional tourist destination. One of its local products, [[Poulsbo Bread]], is made locally at Sluys Bakery and used to be sold internationally.

Poulsbo was incorporated on December 18, 1907.\n\nUntil [[World War II]], many Poulsbo residents retained [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] as a primary language. However, during [[World War II]], the military constructed about 300 residential units to provide housing for workers at the nearby [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]] in [[Bremerton, Washington|Bremerton]]. The population of Poulsbo almost tripled over three years, and the diversification of the population led to the dominance of [[English language|English]] as the primary language.\n\nOn October 22, 1975, King [[Olav V of Norway]] visited Poulsbo as part of the celebration of 150 years of Norwegian immigration to the United States.<ref name=Jacobi>{{cite news | title = King at home in Poulsbo | newspaper = Seattle Post-Intelligencer | year = 1975 | url= http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file_id=8361 }}</ref> His son, Harald, visited 20 years later.\n\n==Schools==\nPoulsbo is home to many different [[state school|public schools]] in the North Kitsap School District.

Poulsbo was founded in the 1880s by Norwegian immigrant J\u00f8rgen Eliason, who was joined by other Scandinavians who relocated from the [[Midwest|Midwestern states]]. They were drawn here by the availability of land, by the area's rich resources, and by a landscape similar to their native home. The settlement was connected by boats to other areas of the region, including the [[Puget Sound mosquito fleet]], which was eventually usurped by highways built in the early 20th century.\n\nModern-day downtown Poulsbo maintains a Scandinavian theme to honor its early immigrant history and is a popular regional tourist destination. One of its local products, [[Poulsbo Bread]], is made locally at Sluys Bakery and used to be sold internationally. Many visitors arrive by boat; there are three [[marina]]s near the town, and the town's harbor is an excellent anchorage.\n\n==History==\n[[File:First Lutheran Church of Poulsbo.jpg|thumb|left|First Lutheran Church of Poulsbo]]\n\nThe [[Suquamish]] people inhabited the area at the north end of [[Liberty Bay]] for millennia and had several names for modern-day Poulsbo; one of those names, ''tcu-tcu-lats'', means \"place of the maples\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.northkitsapherald.com/business/311052921.html |title=Viking Avenue business owner will replace trees he cut down |work=North Kitsap Herald |date=June 30, 2015 |first=Richard |last=Walker |accessdate=August 30, 2016}}</ref> The Suquamish occupied villages on the Liberty Bay shoreline \u2014 among them, ''ho-CHEEB''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.northkitsapherald.com/news/304004031.html |title=1 million Norwegians immigrated to U.S. between 1820 and 1920 {{!}} Viking Fest |work=North Kitsap Herald |date=May 16, 2015 |accessdate=August 30, 2016}}</ref> \u2014 for at least 5,000 years, hunted in local forests and floodplains, fished in bays and streams here, and harvested shellfish along the shoreline.\n\nAfter the signing of the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] in 1855, most Suquamish people here relocated to the [[Port Madison Indian Reservation]], although the Suquamish Tribe reserved \u2014 and to this day exercises \u2014 certain cultural and natural resource rights in its historical territory, including Poulsbo.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n[[File:Oyster dyke at Poulsbo, Washington, June 1920 (COBB 143).jpeg|thumb|[[Oyster farming]] in Poulsbo, 1920]]\n\nFounded by Norwegian immigrant J\u00f8rgen Eliason in the 1880s, Poulsbo was settled in its early years by a large number of [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] and other [[Scandinavia]]n immigrants because of its similarities to their native countries.<ref name=majors>{{Cite book| last = Majors | first = Harry M. | title = Exploring Washington | publisher = Van Winkle Publishing Co | year = 1975 | page = 82 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CoWrPQAACAAJ| isbn = 978-0-918664-00-6}}</ref> In 1886, I.B. Moe, one of the early Norwegian settlers, suggested that the community should have a post office. Moe suggested the town be named \"Paulsbo\" (which translates as \"Paul's place\"), after the village in [[Halden]], Norway,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mapcarta.com/31279866 |title=Paulsbo |website=Mapcarta}}</ref> where Moe spent his early years. The community's petition for a post office was granted and Moe became the first postmaster, but authorities in Washington, D.C. misspelled the town's name, likely misreading Moe's handwriting,{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} and the community became known as \"Poulsbo\" thereafter. Poulsbo was incorporated on December 18, 1907.\n\nUntil [[World War II]], many Poulsbo residents retained [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] as a primary language. However, during [[World War II]], the military constructed about 300 residential units to provide housing for workers at the nearby [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]] in [[Bremerton, Washington|Bremerton]]. The population of Poulsbo almost tripled over three years, and the diversification of the population led to the dominance of [[English language|English]] as the primary language.\n\nOn October 22, 1975, King [[Olav V of Norway]] visited Poulsbo as part of the celebration of 150 years of Norwegian immigration to the United States.<ref name=Jacobi>{{cite news | title = King at home in Poulsbo | newspaper = Seattle Post-Intelligencer | year = 1975 | url= http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file_id=8361 }}</ref> His son, Harald, visited 20 years later.\n\n==Schools==\nPoulsbo is home to many different [[state school|public schools]] in the North Kitsap School District.

{"title_page": "Friedrich Clemens Gerke", "text_new": "[[File: Gerke.jpg| thumb|right | Friedrich Clemens Gerke, 1840]]\n'''Friedrich Clemens Gerke''' (22 January 1801 \u2013 21 May 1888) was a [[Germans|German]] writer, journalist, musician and pioneer of [[telegraph]]y who revised the [[Morse code]] in 1848. It is Gerke's version of the original (American) Morse code now known as the International Morse code and standardized by the ITU (International Telecommunications Union) which is used today.\n\n==Life==\nGerke was born in [[Osnabr\u00fcck]] and grew up in modest circumstances. At the age of 16, he came to Hamburg as a servant and houseboy to the private scientist Arnold Schuback. In 1818, he became a clerk with Senator Brunnemann, and received a fixed wage for the first time in his life. On 10 July 1820 he married Sophie Marianne Duclais, a young, non wealthy French immigrant. They tried to establish a hatter business, but it soon failed and went into bankruptcy. They then decided to emigrate, like many other Europeans in the 19th century, and planned to join the British Army. Via Twielenfleth ([[Lower Saxony]]) and the Isle of [[Heligoland]] in the German Bight, they went to [[Canada]] in 1820, and Gerke served as a musician in the Rifle Battalion, 60th Regiment.<ref>* Hans Brecht: ''Friedrich Clemens Gerke, ein fast vergessener Hamburger Schriftsteller und Erfinder''. In: ''Zeitschrift des Vereins f\u00fcr Hamburgische Geschichte, Band 86, 2000''</ref> He played the [[clarinet]] and horn.\n\nGerke did not enjoy being in the military service, and he managed to find someone else to take his place in the army. He subsequently returned to Hamburg in 1823.\n\n==Optical and electrical telegraph==\nIn the years before Gerke joined the optical and later the electrical telegraph, he worked as a musician in pubs and establishments for sailors on the [[Reeperbahn]]. This area of Hamburg was under [[Denmark|Danish]] administration in those days. He also started a career in writing and journalism and published many articles about social life and criticized\nmisgovernment. Gerke wrote several books about life in general, nature, and healthcare. After some years he terminated his musical profession because he earned enough money from his writings.\n\nFrom 1838 on he joined the optical telegraph of Johann Ludwig Schmidt, who established a private telegraph line between Hamburg and [[Cuxhaven]].<ref>* Detlev Kasten: ''100 Jahre Telegraphenamt Hamburg''. In: ''Postgeschichtliche Bl\u00e4tter Hamburg Ausgabe 1968''</ref> Gerke's first job was to fix their technical problems. This optical telegraph line served as a ship reporting system between Cuxhaven at the Elbe estuary and the some 120&nbsp;km further upstream port of Hamburg. In 1842, the year of the 'Great Hamburg Fire', he requested help from\nneighbouring fire brigades using the optical telegraph.\n\nBy request of the Hamburg Senator Carl M\u00f6hring, the Americans William and Charles Robinson demonstrated their electrical Morse telegraph. Recognizing the great advantages of the new technology, Gerke defected to the Elektro-Magnetische Telegraph Companie which started its regular service on 15 July 1848 between Hamburg and Cuxhaven. Gerke became inspector of this company, which for the first time in Europe used Morse code on landlines.\n\n==Revision of Morse's Code==\nGerke perceived the disadvantages of the [[American Morse code]] and changed nearly half of it into its present form, the International Telegraph Alphabet. The original Morse code consisted of four different hold durations (the amount of time the key was held down), and some letters contained inconsistent internal durations of silence. In Gerke's system there are only \"dits\" and \"dahs\", the latter being three times as long as the former, and the internal silence intervals are always a single dit-time each.  This new code was first adopted by the Deutsch-Oesterreichischer Telegraphenverein and in 1865 accepted by a convent of the [[International Telegraph Union]] in Paris.[[File:Gerke tree.jpg|center|450px| Morse Code in Gerke coding]]\n\n==Latter years==\n[[File:Gerke1870.JPG|thumb]]\nIn 1850 his wife Marianne died; they had no children. A short time later he married a much younger woman, Friedericke Wilhelmine Tietz, with whom he had 5five children.\n\nFrom 1868 on, Gerke worked with the then built Hamburger Telegraph Office and became its first director.\n\nOn 21 May 1888 Gerke died in [[Hamburg]] and was buried on the Hamburg Ohlsdorf cemetery. The grave was given up by the family in the 1930s.\n\n== References ==\n{{commons category|Friedrich Clemens Gerke}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n<!-- {{nofootnotes|date=February 2010}}  -->\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gerke, Friedrich Clemens}}\n[[Category:1801 births]]\n[[Category:1888 deaths]]\n[[Category:Morse code]]\n[[Category:German journalists]]\n[[Category:German male journalists]]\n[[Category:19th-century German journalists]]\n[[Category:19th-century German male writers]]\n[[Category:People from Osnabr\u00fcck]]\n", "text_old": "[[File: Gerke.jpg| thumb|right | Friedrich Clemens Gerke, 1840]]\n'''Friedrich Clemens Gerke''' (22 January 1801 \u2013 21 May 1888) was a [[Germans|German]] writer, journalist, musician and pioneer of [[telegraph]]y who revised the [[Morse code]] in 1848.
