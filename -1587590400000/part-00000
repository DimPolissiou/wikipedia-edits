Using this knowledge, he interacts with the kid or kids ordering the packages until they reach a problem, during which he calls for the assistance of one or more of the Super Wings (some of the people ordering the packages are adults in certain episodes). The additional help would assist in solving the problem before they leave with Jett.\n\nThe format remained relevant in Season 2, though the interaction segments were dropped. Jimbo also no longer works at World Airport in this season, being replaced by his niece Sky while he goes on an around-the-world vacation (though he still makes cameos in the locations Jett makes his deliveries). The assisting format was also altered, as typically more than one Super Wing ends up with Jett at the end of the episode.\n\nSeason 3 brings the interaction segment back to the fold, and sees Jimbo return as a maintenance technician. The rest of the format stays the same as in Season 2, though the assistance method was changed once again. Jett now receives help from a specialized ''team'' of Super Wings, rather than a random selection. The episode count also dropped from 52 to 40.\n\nMajor changes came in Season 4, and much of the show now takes place on World Aircraft, a giant plane functioning as a mobile airport (with Jimbo as captain and Sky as communications officer). The kids now actually call the Super Wings to make specialized products (manufactured by Storm, a new character and World Aircraft's chief engineer), which were shipped in metal containers rather than the cardboard boxes of the past seasons. Jett now regularly has a travel buddy for his deliveries, and they are instead given upgrades via a super charge beam instead of receiving help, though other Super Wings show up at random times in some episodes.\n\n== Development ==\n''Super Wings'' Mission Team was announced in September 2013, and had a licensing market debut at that year's [[MIPCOM|MIPJunior]] in [[Cannes]], [[France]].<ref name=\"KSSep13\">{{cite web|url=http://kidscreen.com/2013/09/03/china-korea-and-the-us-team-up-for-super-wings/|title=China, Korea and the US team up for Super Wings|work=kidscreen.com|accessdate=March 16, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Characters ==\n* '''Jett''' ({{Lang-ko|\ud638\uae30}}; {{Lang-zh|\u4e50\u8fea}}; voiced by Luca Padovan (Season 1) and Hudson Loverro (Season 2-present) in the English version): The main character, a red and white male jet plane.

Using this knowledge, he interacts with the kid or kids ordering the packages until they reach a problem, during which he calls for the assistance of one or more of the Super Wings (some of the people ordering the packages are adults in certain episodes). The additional help would assist in solving the problem before they leave with Jett.\n\nThe format remained relevant in Season 2, though the interaction segments were dropped. Jimbo also no longer works at World Airport in this season, being replaced by his niece Sky while he goes on an around-the-world vacation (though he still makes cameos in the locations Jett makes his deliveries). The assisting format was also altered, as typically more than one Super Wing ends up with Jett at the end of the episode.\n\nSeason 3 brings the interaction segment back to the fold, and sees Jimbo return as a maintenance technician. The rest of the format stays the same as in Season 2, though the assistance method was changed once again. Jett now receives help from a specialized ''team'' of Super Wings, rather than a random selection. The episode count also dropped from 52 to 40.\n\nMajor changes came in Season 4, and much of the show now takes place on World Aircraft, a giant plane functioning as a mobile airport (with Jimbo as captain and Sky as communications officer). The kids now actually call the Super Wings to make specialized products (manufactured by Storm, a new character and World Aircraft's chief engineer), which were shipped in metal containers rather than the cardboard boxes of the past seasons. Jett now regularly has a travel buddy for his deliveries, and they are instead given upgrades via a super charge beam instead of receiving help, though other Super Wings show up at random times in some episodes.\n\n== Development ==\n''Super Wings'' Mission Team was announced in September 2013, and had a licensing market debut at that year's [[MIPCOM|MIPJunior]] in [[Cannes]], [[France]].<ref name=\"KSSep13\">{{cite web|url=http://kidscreen.com/2013/09/03/china-korea-and-the-us-team-up-for-super-wings/|title=China, Korea and the US team up for Super Wings|work=kidscreen.com|accessdate=March 16, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Characters ==\n* '''Jett''' ({{Lang-ko|\ud638\uae30}}; {{Lang-zh|\u4e50\u8fea}}; voiced by Luca Padovan (Season 1) and Hudson Loverro (Season 2-present) in the English version): The main character, a red and white male jet plane.
