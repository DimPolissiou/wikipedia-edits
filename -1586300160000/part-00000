Although Aberdeen were one of Scotland's major clubs they had won the league only once, in [[1954\u201355 in Scottish football|1955]] under [[Dave Halliday]]. The team had been playing well, however, and had not lost a league match since the previous December, having finished second in the league the previous season.<ref name=\"boss159\">Crick, p. 159</ref> Ferguson had now been a manager for four years, but was still not much older than some of the players and had trouble winning the respect of some of the older ones such as [[Joe Harper]].<ref name=\"boss171\">Crick, p. 171</ref> The season did not go especially well, with Aberdeen reaching the semi-final of the [[Scottish Cup]] and the [[1979 Scottish League Cup Final (March)|Scottish League Cup Final]], but losing both matches and [[1978\u201379 Scottish Premier Division|finishing fourth in the league]].\n\nAberdeen lost the [[1979 Scottish League Cup Final (December)|1979\u201380 Scottish League Cup Final]], this time to [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] after a replay. Ferguson took the blame for the defeat, saying he should have made changes to the team for the replay.<ref name=\"boss174\">Crick, p. 174</ref>\n\n====1980s and silverware====\nAberdeen had started the [[1979\u201380 Scottish Football League|1979\u201380 season]] poorly but their form improved dramatically in the new year and they won the Scottish league that season with a 5\u20130 win on the final day. It was the first time in 15 years that the league had not been won by either Rangers or Celtic. Ferguson now felt that he had the respect of his players, later saying \"That was the achievement which united us. I finally had the players believing in me\".<ref name=\"boss175\">Crick, p. 175</ref>\n\nHe was still a strict disciplinarian, though, and his players nicknamed him \"Furious Fergie\".

He was initially worried that many of the players, such as [[Norman Whiteside]], [[Paul McGrath (footballer)|Paul McGrath]] and [[Bryan Robson]] were drinking too much and was \"depressed\" by their level of fitness, but he managed to increase the players' discipline and United climbed up the table to finish the season in 11th place, having been 21st (second from bottom) when he took over.\n\nHis first game in charge was a 2\u20130 defeat at [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]] on 8 November, followed seven days later by a goalless draw at newly promoted [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], and then his first win (1\u20130 at home to [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]]) on 22 November. Results steadily improved as the season went on, and by the time they recorded what would be their only away win of the league campaign at title challengers and deadly rivals Liverpool on [[Boxing Day]], it was clear that United were on the road to recovery. 1987 began on a high note with a 4\u20131 victory over [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] and United gradually pulled together in the second half of the season, with relatively occasional defeats on the way, and finished 11th in the final table. Ferguson's mother Elizabeth died of lung cancer, aged 64, three weeks after his appointment. Ferguson hired Archie Knox, his assistant at Aberdeen, in the same role at Manchester United in 1986.\n\nIn the 1987\u201388 season, Ferguson made several major signings, including [[Steve Bruce]], [[Viv Anderson]], [[Brian McClair]] and [[Jim Leighton]]. The new players made a great contribution to a United team who finished in second place, nine points behind Liverpool. Liverpool's points lead, however, had been in double digits for most of the season and while United had lost only five league games all season, they drew 12 games and there was clearly still some way to go before United could be a match for their north western rivals.\n\nDuring the season, United played two friendly matches in Bermuda against the [[Bermuda national football team|Bermuda national team]] and the Somerset Cricket Club.<ref name = \"bermuda\"/> In the match against Somerset, both Ferguson himself and his assistant Archie Knox took to the field, with Knox even getting on the scoresheet. The match was Ferguson's only appearance for the Manchester United first team.<ref name = \"bermuda\">{{cite web |url=http://footysphere.com/post/13169778853/alex-ferguson-bermuda-man-utd |title=Manchester United Tour of Bermuda 1987 |work=footysphere.com |accessdate=23 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nUnited were expected to do well when [[Mark Hughes]] returned to the club two years after leaving for [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], but the [[1988\u201389 Manchester United F.C. season|1988\u201389 season]] was a disappointment for them, finishing 11th in the league and losing 1\u20130 at home to Nottingham Forest in the [[1988\u201389 FA Cup#Sixth Round Proper|FA Cup sixth round]]. They had begun the season slowly, going on a nine-match winless run throughout October and November (with one defeat and eight draws) before a run of generally good results took them to third place and the fringes of the title challenge by mid February. However, another run of disappointing results in the final quarter of the season saw them fall down to mid-table.\n\nFor the [[1989\u201390 Manchester United F.C. season|1989\u201390 season]], Ferguson further boosted his squad by paying large sums of money for midfielders [[Neil Webb]], [[Mike Phelan]], and [[Paul Ince]], as well as defender [[Gary Pallister]] and winger [[Danny Wallace (footballer)|Danny Wallace]]. The season began well with a 4\u20131 win over defending champions Arsenal on the opening day, but United's league form quickly turned sour. In September, United suffered a humiliating 5\u20131 away defeat against [[Manchester derby|fierce rivals]] [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. Following this and an early season run of six defeats and two draws in eight games, a banner declaring, \"Three years of excuses and it's still crap&nbsp;... ta-ra Fergie.\" was displayed at Old Trafford, and many journalists and supporters called for Ferguson to be sacked.<ref name=\"3years\">{{cite news|title=Arise Sir Alex?|work=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1999/05/99/uniteds_treble_triumph/354282.stm|accessdate=3 December 2005|date=27 May 1999}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Sir Alex Ferguson's 20 years at Manchester United|work=BBC Sport|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/6113634.stm|accessdate=11 August 2011|date=6 November 2006}}</ref> Ferguson later described December 1989 as \"the darkest period [he had] ever suffered in the game\", as United ended the decade just outside the relegation zone.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ferguson hungry for more success|work=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/8062015.stm|accessdate=11 August 2011|date=22 May 2009|first=David|last=Ornstein}}</ref><ref name=\"jc27\">{{cite book|first=Alex|last=Ferguson|author2=Peter Fitton|title=Just Champion!|publisher=Manchester United Football Club plc|year=1993|isbn=0-9520509-1-9|page=27}}</ref>\n\nFollowing a run of seven games without a win, Manchester United were drawn away to Nottingham Forest in the third round of the FA Cup.

United's defensive frailties in the first match were unilaterally blamed on goalkeeper Jim Leighton, forcing Ferguson to drop his former Aberdeen player and bring in [[Les Sealey]].\n\n====United's European firsts and Ferguson's seconds====\n{{blp sources|section|date=March 2019}}\nAlthough United's league form improved greatly in [[1990\u201391 Manchester United F.C. season|1990\u201391]], they were still inconsistent and finished sixth. There were some excellent performances that season, including a 6\u20132 demolition of Arsenal at [[Arsenal Stadium|Highbury]], but results like an early 2\u20131 loss at newly promoted [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], a 4\u20130 September hammering by Liverpool at Anfield, and a 2\u20130 home defeat by [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in early March (the game where 17-year-old talented prospect [[Ryan Giggs]] made his senior debut) showed that United still had some way to go.\n\nEven after the FA Cup victory in the previous season, some still had doubts about Ferguson's ability to succeed where all the other managers since [[Matt Busby]] had failed&nbsp;\u2013 to win the league title.<ref name=\"Pressure\"/> They were runners-up in the [[1991 Football League Cup Final|League Cup]], losing 1\u20130 to [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]]. However, they won the [[1991 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|European Cup Winners' Cup]], beating that season's Spanish champions [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] 2\u20131. It would be United's only Cup Winners' Cup title. After the match, Ferguson vowed that United would win the league the following season, and at long last he seemed to have won over the last of his sceptics after nearly five years in the job.<ref name=\"mml302\">Ferguson, p. 302</ref>\n\nDuring the 1991 close season, Ferguson's assistant Archie Knox departed to Rangers to become assistant to [[Walter Smith]], and Ferguson promoted youth team coach [[Brian Kidd]] to the role of assistant manager in Knox's place. He also made two major signings \u2013 goalkeeper [[Peter Schmeichel]] and defender [[Paul Parker (footballer)|Paul Parker]] \u2013 to bolster his side. There was much anticipation about the breakthrough of the young Ryan Giggs, who had played twice and scored once in the 1990\u201391 campaign, and the earlier emergence of another impressive young winger in the shape of [[Lee Sharpe]], who despite their youth had made Ferguson feel able to resist plunging into the transfer market and buying a new player to take over from the disappointing Danny Wallace on the left wing. He had also added Soviet midfielder [[Andrei Kanchelskis]] to the right wing, giving him a more attacking alternative to older midfielders [[Mike Phelan]] and Bryan Robson.\n\nThe [[1991\u201392 Manchester United F.C. season|1991\u201392 season]] did not live up to Ferguson's expectations and, in Ferguson's words, \"many in the media felt that [his] mistakes had contributed to the misery\".<ref name=\"mml311\">Ferguson, p. 311</ref> United won the [[1992 Football League Cup Final|League Cup]] and [[1991 European Super Cup|European Super Cup]]; both for the first time, but lost out on the [[1991\u201392 Football League#First Division 2|league title]] to rivals [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] after leading the table for much of the season. A shortage of goals and being held to draws by teams they had been expected to beat in the second half of the campaign had proved to be the undoing of a United side who had performed so well in the first half of the season. Ferguson felt that his failure to secure the signing of [[Mick Harford]] from [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] had cost United the league, and that he needed \"an extra dimension\" to the team if they were to win the league the following season.<ref name=\"mml320\">Ferguson, p. 320</ref>\n\nDuring the 1992 close season, Ferguson went on the hunt for a new striker. He first attempted to sign [[Alan Shearer]] from [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], but lost out to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]. He also made at least one approach for the Sheffield Wednesday striker [[David Hirst (footballer)|David Hirst]], but manager [[Trevor Francis]] rejected all offers and the player stayed put. In the end, he paid \u00a31&nbsp;million for 23-year-old [[Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United]] striker [[Dion Dublin]] \u2013 his only major signing of the summer.\n\nAfter a slow start to the [[1992\u201393 Manchester United F.C. season|1992\u201393 season]] by sitting 10th at the beginning of November, it looked as though United would miss out on the [[1992\u201393 FA Premier League|league]] title yet again. However, after the purchase of French striker [[Eric Cantona]] from Leeds for \u00a31.2&nbsp;million, the future of Manchester United, and Ferguson's position as manager, began to look bright. Cantona formed a strong partnership with Mark Hughes. On 10 April 1993, United were second in the league when they faced Sheffield Wednesday at home. United were losing with four minutes to go before [[Steve Bruce]] equalised. After 7 minutes of injury time \u2013 which was subsequently dubbed \u201cFergie Time\u201d, alluding to extra minutes allegedly being granted to Ferguson\u2019s teams to get a goal \u2013 Bruce scored the 97th minute winner, with Ferguson [[goal celebration|celebrating the goal]] by running from his dugout on to the touch line, while assistant Brian Kidd ran on to the field.<ref name=\"Fergie Time\">{{cite news |title=From the Vault: Manchester United, 'Fergie Time' and Steve Bruce's headers|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/apr/10/vault-steve-bruce-headers-manchester-united |accessdate=15 October 2018 |work=The Guardian}}</ref> Seen as being a decisive victory, it put United top of the league, where they remained. Winning the title ended United's 26-year wait for a league title, and also made them the first [[List of English football champions#Premier League (1992\u2013present)|Premier League champions]]. United finished with a ten-point margin over runners-up [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], whose 1\u20130 defeat at [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] on 2 May 1993 had given United the title.

Ferguson added Nottingham Forest's 22-year-old midfielder [[Roy Keane]] to the ranks for a British record fee of \u00a33.75&nbsp;million as a long term replacement for Bryan Robson, who was nearing the end of his career.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/apr/23/roy-keane-career-highs-lows |title=The highs and lows of Roy Keane's career |date=23 April 2009 |accessdate=13 July 2011 |work=The Guardian |location=London }}</ref> United led the [[1993\u201394 Premier League]] table virtually from start to finish. Ferguson was the very first winner of the [[Premier League Manager of the Month]] award, introduced for the start of the 1993\u201394 season, when he collected the accolade for August 1993. Cantona was top scorer with 25 goals in all competitions despite being [[Foul (association football)|sent off]] twice in the space of five days in March 1994. United also reached the League Cup final but lost 3\u20131 to Aston Villa, managed by Ferguson's predecessor, Ron Atkinson. In the FA Cup final, Manchester United achieved an impressive 4\u20130 scoreline against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], winning Ferguson his second [[Double (association football)#England|League and Cup Double]], following his Scottish Premier Division and Scottish Cup titles with Aberdeen in 1984\u201385, though the League Cup final defeat meant that he had not yet achieved a repeat of the treble that he had achieved with Aberdeen in 1983.\n\nFerguson made only one close-season signing, paying Blackburn \u00a31.2&nbsp;million for [[David May (footballer)|David May]]. There were newspaper reports that Ferguson was also going to sign highly rated 21-year-old striker [[Chris Sutton]] from Norwich City, but the player headed for Blackburn instead. [[1994\u201395 Manchester United F.C. season|1994\u201395]] was a harder season for Ferguson. Cantona assaulted a Crystal Palace supporter in a game at [[Selhurst Park]], and it seemed likely he would leave English football. An eight-month ban saw Cantona miss the final four months of the season. He also received a 14-day prison sentence for the offence but the sentence was quashed on appeal and replaced by a 120-hour community service order. On the brighter side, United paid a British record fee of \u00a37&nbsp;million for Newcastle United's prolific striker [[Andy Cole]], with young winger [[Keith Gillespie]] heading to the north-east in exchange. The season also saw the breakthrough of young players [[Gary Neville]], [[Nicky Butt]] and [[Paul Scholes]], who provided excellent cover for the long periods that United were left without some of their more experienced stars. However, the championship slipped out of Manchester United's grasp as they drew 1\u20131 with [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] on the final day of the season, when a win would have given them a third successive league title. United also lost the FA Cup final in a 1\u20130 defeat by Everton.\n\n====1995\u201398====\nFerguson was heavily criticised in the summer of 1995 when three of United's star players were allowed to leave and replacements were not bought. First Paul Ince moved to [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]] of Italy for \u00a37.5&nbsp;million, long-serving striker Mark Hughes was sold to Chelsea in a \u00a31.5&nbsp;million deal, and Andrei Kanchelskis was sold to Everton. Ferguson felt that United had a number of young players who were ready to play in the first team. The youngsters, who would be known as \"Fergie's Fledglings\", included Gary Neville, [[Phil Neville]], [[David Beckham]], Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt, who would all go on to be important members of the team. And so the [[1995\u201396 Manchester United F.C. season|1995\u201396 season]] began without a major signing, at a time when the likes of Arsenal, Liverpool and Newcastle were making the headlines with big-money signings.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nA youthful United team lost 3\u20131 in their opening league game of the 1995\u201396 season, against Aston Villa.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ferguson watches seeds of doubt grow |first=Keith |last=Pike |page=23 |newspaper=The Times |location=London |date=21 August 1995}}</ref> On ''[[Match of the Day]]'', pundit [[Alan Hansen]] criticised their performance, ending his analysis with the words, \"You can't win anything with kids.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/15527986 |work=BBC Sport |first=Alan |last=Hansen |title=Sir Alex Ferguson 25 years: 'You can't win anything with kids' |date=2 November 2011|accessdate=9 May 2013}}</ref> United won their next five matches and were boosted by the return of Cantona, who made his comeback against Liverpool in October 1995.

A second-round exit from the European Cup at the hands of Milan and a semi-final exit from the League Cup at the hands of eventual winners Chelsea (who also clinched the Premier League title) meant that 2004\u201305 was a rare instance of a trophyless season for United.

In spite of this, United looked to solve their goalkeeping and midfield problems. For this, they signed the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch]] goalkeeper [[Edwin van der Sar]] from [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] and [[South Korea national football team|Korean]] star [[Park Ji-sung]] from PSV.\n\nThe season was one of transition. On 18 November, Roy Keane officially left the club, his contract ended by mutual consent. United failed to qualify for the knock-out phase of the UEFA Champions' League. In the January transfer window, Serbian defender [[Nemanja Vidi\u0107]] and French full-back [[Patrice Evra]] were signed, and the side finished in second place in the league, behind runaway leaders Chelsea.

He briefly managed [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] following the death of [[Jock Stein]], taking the team to the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]].\n\nFerguson was appointed manager of [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in November 1986.

[[Dunfermline Athletic F.C.|Dunfermline]] signed him the following summer (1964), and Ferguson became a full-time professional footballer.\n\nThe following season ([[1964\u201365 in Scottish football|1964\u201365]]), Dunfermline were strong challengers for the Scottish League and reached the [[1965 Scottish Cup Final|Scottish Cup Final]], but Ferguson was dropped for the final after a poor performance in a league game against St Johnstone. Dunfermline lost the final 3\u20132 to [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], then failed to win the League by one point. The [[1965\u201366 in Scottish football|1965\u201366]] season saw Ferguson notch up 45 goals in 51 games for Dunfermline.

He remained at Brockville for four years gaining more league appearances than he had elsewhere; in light of his experience he was promoted to player-coach, but when [[John Prentice (footballer born 1926)|John Prentice]] became manager he removed Ferguson's coaching responsibilities.

He did not speak to her for six weeks, confiscated her keys and communicated only through a 17-year-old assistant.

Todd explained that the fundamental reason for the dismissal was a breach of contract relating to Ferguson having agreed to join Aberdeen. Ferguson told journalist Jim Rodger of the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' that he had asked at least one member of the squad to go to Aberdeen with him. He told the St Mirren staff he was leaving.

Although Aberdeen were one of Scotland's major clubs they had won the league only once, in [[1954\u201355 in Scottish football|1955]] under [[Dave Halliday]]. The team had been playing well, however, and had not lost a league match since the previous December, having finished second in the league the previous season.<ref name=\"boss159\">Crick, p. 159</ref> Ferguson had now been a manager for four years, but was still not much older than some of the players and had trouble winning the respect of some of the older ones such as [[Joe Harper]].<ref name=\"boss171\">Crick, p. 171</ref> The season did not go especially well, with Aberdeen reaching the semi-final of the [[Scottish Cup]] and the [[1979 Scottish League Cup Final (March)|Scottish League Cup Final]], but losing both matches and [[1978\u201379 Scottish Premier Division|finishing fourth in the league]].\n\nAberdeen lost the [[1979 Scottish League Cup Final (December)|1979\u201380 Scottish League Cup Final]], this time to [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] after a replay. Ferguson took the blame for the defeat, saying he should have made changes to the team for the replay.<ref name=\"boss174\">Crick, p. 174</ref>\n\n====1980s and silverware====\nAberdeen had started the [[1979\u201380 Scottish Football League|1979\u201380 season]] poorly but their form improved dramatically in the new year and they won the Scottish league that season with a 5\u20130 win on the final day. It was the first time in 15 years that the league had not been won by either Rangers or Celtic. Ferguson now felt that he had the respect of his players, later saying \"That was the achievement which united us. I finally had the players believing in me\".<ref name=\"boss175\">Crick, p. 175</ref>\n\nHe was still a strict disciplinarian, though, and his players nicknamed him \"Furious Fergie\". He fined one of his players, [[John Hewitt (footballer)|John Hewitt]], for overtaking him on a public road,<ref name=\"boss179\">Crick, p. 179</ref> and kicked a tea urn at the players at half time after a poor first half.<ref name=\"boss180\">Crick, p. 180</ref> He was dissatisfied with the atmosphere at Aberdeen matches, and deliberately created a \"[[siege mentality]]\" by accusing the Scottish media of being biased towards the Glasgow clubs, to motivate the team.<ref name=\"boss191\">Crick, p. 191</ref> The team continued their success with a Scottish Cup win in [[1982 Scottish Cup Final|1982]].

Ferguson had been appointed to the club's board of directors early in 1986, but that April he told [[Dick Donald]], their chairman, that he intended to leave that summer.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nFerguson had been part of coaching staff for the [[Scotland national football team|Scottish national side]] during qualifying for the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]], but manager [[Jock Stein]] had [[1985 Wales vs Scotland football match|collapsed and died on 10 September 1985]] \u2013 at the end of the game in which Scotland qualified from their group for a play-off against [[Australia national soccer team|Australia]]. Ferguson promptly agreed to take charge of the Scottish national side against the Australians and subsequently at the World Cup. To allow him to fulfil his international duties he appointed [[Archie Knox]] as his co-manager at Aberdeen. However, after Scotland failed to progress past the group stages of the World Cup, Ferguson stepped down as national team manager on 15 June 1986.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YNJAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=1aYMAAAAIBAJ&pg=6630,3393659&dq=manchester-united+ferguson|title=Fergie Steps Down|date=16 June 1986|work=Evening Times|accessdate=10 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nAround this time, Tottenham Hotspur offered Ferguson the chance to take over from [[Peter Shreeves]] as manager, but he rejected this offer and the job went to [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town's]] [[David Pleat]] instead.

He was initially worried that many of the players, such as [[Norman Whiteside]], [[Paul McGrath (footballer)|Paul McGrath]] and [[Bryan Robson]] were drinking too much and was \"depressed\" by their level of fitness, but he managed to increase the players' discipline and United climbed up the table to finish the season in 11th place, having been 21st (second from bottom) when he took over.\n\nHis first game in charge was a 2\u20130 defeat at [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]] on 8 November, followed seven days later by a goalless draw at newly promoted [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], and then his first win (1\u20130 at home to [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]]) on 22 November. Results steadily improved as the season went on, and by the time they recorded what would be their only away win of the league campaign at title challengers and deadly rivals Liverpool on [[Boxing Day]], it was clear that United were on the road to recovery. 1987 began on a high note with a 4\u20131 victory over [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] and United gradually pulled together in the second half of the season, with relatively occasional defeats on the way, and finished 11th in the final table. Ferguson's mother Elizabeth died of lung cancer, aged 64, three weeks after his appointment. Ferguson hired Archie Knox, his assistant at Aberdeen, in the same role at Manchester United in 1986.\n\nIn the 1987\u201388 season, Ferguson made several major signings, including [[Steve Bruce]], [[Viv Anderson]], [[Brian McClair]] and [[Jim Leighton]]. The new players made a great contribution to a United team who finished in second place, nine points behind Liverpool. Liverpool's points lead, however, had been in double digits for most of the season and while United had lost only five league games all season, they drew 12 games and there was clearly still some way to go before United could be a match for their north western rivals.\n\nDuring the season, United played two friendly matches in Bermuda against the [[Bermuda national football team|Bermuda national team]] and the Somerset Cricket Club.<ref name = \"bermuda\"/> In the match against Somerset, both Ferguson himself and his assistant Archie Knox took to the field, with Knox even getting on the scoresheet. The match was Ferguson's only appearance for the Manchester United first team.<ref name = \"bermuda\">{{cite web |url=http://footysphere.com/post/13169778853/alex-ferguson-bermuda-man-utd |title=Manchester United Tour of Bermuda 1987 |work=footysphere.com |accessdate=23 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nUnited were expected to do well when [[Mark Hughes]] returned to the club two years after leaving for [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], but the [[1988\u201389 Manchester United F.C. season|1988\u201389 season]] was a disappointment for them, finishing 11th in the league and losing 1\u20130 at home to Nottingham Forest in the [[1988\u201389 FA Cup#Sixth Round Proper|FA Cup sixth round]]. They had begun the season slowly, going on a nine-match winless run throughout October and November (with one defeat and eight draws) before a run of generally good results took them to third place and the fringes of the title challenge by mid February. However, another run of disappointing results in the final quarter of the season saw them fall down to mid-table.\n\nFor the [[1989\u201390 Manchester United F.C. season|1989\u201390 season]], Ferguson further boosted his squad by paying large sums of money for midfielders [[Neil Webb]], [[Mike Phelan]], and [[Paul Ince]], as well as defender [[Gary Pallister]] and winger [[Danny Wallace (footballer)|Danny Wallace]]. The season began well with a 4\u20131 win over defending champions Arsenal on the opening day, but United's league form quickly turned sour. In September, United suffered a humiliating 5\u20131 away defeat against [[Manchester derby|fierce rivals]] [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. Following this and an early season run of six defeats and two draws in eight games, a banner declaring, \"Three years of excuses and it's still crap&nbsp;... ta-ra Fergie.\" was displayed at Old Trafford, and many journalists and supporters called for Ferguson to be sacked.<ref name=\"3years\">{{cite news|title=Arise Sir Alex?|work=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1999/05/99/uniteds_treble_triumph/354282.stm|accessdate=3 December 2005|date=27 May 1999}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Sir Alex Ferguson's 20 years at Manchester United|work=BBC Sport|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/6113634.stm|accessdate=11 August 2011|date=6 November 2006}}</ref> Ferguson later described December 1989 as \"the darkest period [he had] ever suffered in the game\", as United ended the decade just outside the relegation zone.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ferguson hungry for more success|work=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/8062015.stm|accessdate=11 August 2011|date=22 May 2009|first=David|last=Ornstein}}</ref><ref name=\"jc27\">{{cite book|first=Alex|last=Ferguson|author2=Peter Fitton|title=Just Champion!|publisher=Manchester United Football Club plc|year=1993|isbn=0-9520509-1-9|page=27}}</ref>\n\nFollowing a run of seven games without a win, Manchester United were drawn away to Nottingham Forest in the third round of the FA Cup.

United's defensive frailties in the first match were unilaterally blamed on goalkeeper Jim Leighton, forcing Ferguson to drop his former Aberdeen player and bring in [[Les Sealey]].\n\n====United's European firsts and Ferguson's seconds====\n{{blp sources|section|date=March 2019}}\nAlthough United's league form improved greatly in [[1990\u201391 Manchester United F.C. season|1990\u201391]], they were still inconsistent and finished sixth. There were some excellent performances that season, including a 6\u20132 demolition of Arsenal at [[Arsenal Stadium|Highbury]], but results like an early 2\u20131 loss at newly promoted [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], a 4\u20130 September hammering by Liverpool at Anfield, and a 2\u20130 home defeat by [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in early March (the game where 17-year-old talented prospect [[Ryan Giggs]] made his senior debut) showed that United still had some way to go.\n\nEven after the FA Cup victory in the previous season, some still had doubts about Ferguson's ability to succeed where all the other managers since [[Matt Busby]] had failed&nbsp;\u2013 to win the league title.<ref name=\"Pressure\"/> They were runners-up in the [[1991 Football League Cup Final|League Cup]], losing 1\u20130 to [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]]. However, they won the [[1991 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|European Cup Winners' Cup]], beating that season's Spanish champions [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] 2\u20131. It would be United's only Cup Winners' Cup title. After the match, Ferguson vowed that United would win the league the following season, and at long last he seemed to have won over the last of his sceptics after nearly five years in the job.<ref name=\"mml302\">Ferguson, p. 302</ref>\n\nDuring the 1991 close season, Ferguson's assistant Archie Knox departed to Rangers to become assistant to [[Walter Smith]], and Ferguson promoted youth team coach [[Brian Kidd]] to the role of assistant manager in Knox's place. He also made two major signings \u2013 goalkeeper [[Peter Schmeichel]] and defender [[Paul Parker (footballer)|Paul Parker]] \u2013 to bolster his side. There was much anticipation about the breakthrough of the young Ryan Giggs, who had played twice and scored once in the 1990\u201391 campaign, and the earlier emergence of another impressive young winger in the shape of [[Lee Sharpe]], who despite their youth had made Ferguson feel able to resist plunging into the transfer market and buying a new player to take over from the disappointing Danny Wallace on the left wing. He had also added Soviet midfielder [[Andrei Kanchelskis]] to the right wing, giving him a more attacking alternative to older midfielders [[Mike Phelan]] and Bryan Robson.\n\nThe [[1991\u201392 Manchester United F.C. season|1991\u201392 season]] did not live up to Ferguson's expectations and, in Ferguson's words, \"many in the media felt that [his] mistakes had contributed to the misery\".<ref name=\"mml311\">Ferguson, p. 311</ref> United won the [[1992 Football League Cup Final|League Cup]] and [[1991 European Super Cup|European Super Cup]]; both for the first time, but lost out on the [[1991\u201392 Football League#First Division 2|league title]] to rivals [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] after leading the table for much of the season. A shortage of goals and being held to draws by teams they had been expected to beat in the second half of the campaign had proved to be the undoing of a United side who had performed so well in the first half of the season. Ferguson felt that his failure to secure the signing of [[Mick Harford]] from [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] had cost United the league, and that he needed \"an extra dimension\" to the team if they were to win the league the following season.<ref name=\"mml320\">Ferguson, p. 320</ref>\n\nDuring the 1992 close season, Ferguson went on the hunt for a new striker. He first attempted to sign [[Alan Shearer]] from [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], but lost out to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]. He also made at least one approach for the Sheffield Wednesday striker [[David Hirst (footballer)|David Hirst]], but manager [[Trevor Francis]] rejected all offers and the player stayed put. In the end, he paid \u00a31&nbsp;million for 23-year-old [[Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United]] striker [[Dion Dublin]] \u2013 his only major signing of the summer.\n\nAfter a slow start to the [[1992\u201393 Manchester United F.C. season|1992\u201393 season]] by sitting 10th at the beginning of November, it looked as though United would miss out on the [[1992\u201393 FA Premier League|league]] title yet again. However, after the purchase of French striker [[Eric Cantona]] from Leeds for \u00a31.2&nbsp;million, the future of Manchester United, and Ferguson's position as manager, began to look bright. Cantona formed a strong partnership with Mark Hughes. On 10 April 1993, United were second in the league when they faced Sheffield Wednesday at home. United were losing with four minutes to go before [[Steve Bruce]] equalised. After 7 minutes of injury time \u2013 which was subsequently dubbed \u201cFergie Time\u201d, alluding to extra minutes allegedly being granted to Ferguson\u2019s teams to get a goal \u2013 Bruce scored the 97th minute winner, with Ferguson [[goal celebration|celebrating the goal]] by running from his dugout on to the touch line, while assistant Brian Kidd ran on to the field.<ref name=\"Fergie Time\">{{cite news |title=From the Vault: Manchester United, 'Fergie Time' and Steve Bruce's headers|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/apr/10/vault-steve-bruce-headers-manchester-united |accessdate=15 October 2018 |work=The Guardian}}</ref> Seen as being a decisive victory, it put United top of the league, where they remained. Winning the title ended United's 26-year wait for a league title, and also made them the first [[List of English football champions#Premier League (1992\u2013present)|Premier League champions]]. United finished with a ten-point margin over runners-up [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], whose 1\u20130 defeat at [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] on 2 May 1993 had given United the title. Ferguson was later voted [[LMA Manager of the Year|Manager of the Year]] by the [[League Managers' Association]].\n\n====1993\u201395: Double win and loss====\n{{blp unsourced section|date=March 2019}}\nThe [[1993\u201394 Manchester United F.C. season|1993\u201394 season]] brought more success. Ferguson added Nottingham Forest's 22-year-old midfielder [[Roy Keane]] to the ranks for a British record fee of \u00a33.75&nbsp;million as a long term replacement for Bryan Robson, who was nearing the end of his career.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/apr/23/roy-keane-career-highs-lows |title=The highs and lows of Roy Keane's career |date=23 April 2009 |accessdate=13 July 2011 |work=The Guardian |location=London }}</ref> United led the [[1993\u201394 Premier League]] table virtually from start to finish. Ferguson was the very first winner of the [[Premier League Manager of the Month]] award, introduced for the start of the 1993\u201394 season, when he collected the accolade for August 1993. Cantona was top scorer with 25 goals in all competitions despite being [[Foul (association football)|sent off]] twice in the space of five days in March 1994. United also reached the League Cup final but lost 3\u20131 to Aston Villa, managed by Ferguson's predecessor, Ron Atkinson. In the FA Cup final, Manchester United achieved an impressive 4\u20130 scoreline against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], winning Ferguson his second [[Double (association football)#England|League and Cup Double]], following his Scottish Premier Division and Scottish Cup titles with Aberdeen in 1984\u201385, though the League Cup final defeat meant that he had not yet achieved a repeat of the treble that he had achieved with Aberdeen in 1983.\n\nFerguson made only one close-season signing, paying Blackburn \u00a31.2&nbsp;million for [[David May (footballer)|David May]]. There were newspaper reports that Ferguson was also going to sign highly rated 21-year-old striker [[Chris Sutton]] from Norwich City, but the player headed for Blackburn instead. [[1994\u201395 Manchester United F.C. season|1994\u201395]] was a harder season for Ferguson. Cantona assaulted a Crystal Palace supporter in a game at [[Selhurst Park]], and it seemed likely he would leave English football. An eight-month ban saw Cantona miss the final four months of the season. He also received a 14-day prison sentence for the offence but the sentence was quashed on appeal and replaced by a 120-hour community service order. On the brighter side, United paid a British record fee of \u00a37&nbsp;million for Newcastle United's prolific striker [[Andy Cole]], with young winger [[Keith Gillespie]] heading to the north-east in exchange. The season also saw the breakthrough of young players [[Gary Neville]], [[Nicky Butt]] and [[Paul Scholes]], who provided excellent cover for the long periods that United were left without some of their more experienced stars. However, the championship slipped out of Manchester United's grasp as they drew 1\u20131 with [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] on the final day of the season, when a win would have given them a third successive league title. United also lost the FA Cup final in a 1\u20130 defeat by Everton.\n\n====1995\u201398====\nFerguson was heavily criticised in the summer of 1995 when three of United's star players were allowed to leave and replacements were not bought. First Paul Ince moved to [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]] of Italy for \u00a37.5&nbsp;million, long-serving striker Mark Hughes was sold to Chelsea in a \u00a31.5&nbsp;million deal, and Andrei Kanchelskis was sold to Everton. Ferguson felt that United had a number of young players who were ready to play in the first team. The youngsters, who would be known as \"Fergie's Fledglings\", included Gary Neville, [[Phil Neville]], [[David Beckham]], Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt, who would all go on to be important members of the team. And so the [[1995\u201396 Manchester United F.C. season|1995\u201396 season]] began without a major signing, at a time when the likes of Arsenal, Liverpool and Newcastle were making the headlines with big-money signings.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nA youthful United team lost 3\u20131 in their opening league game of the 1995\u201396 season, against Aston Villa.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ferguson watches seeds of doubt grow |first=Keith |last=Pike |page=23 |newspaper=The Times |location=London |date=21 August 1995}}</ref> On ''[[Match of the Day]]'', pundit [[Alan Hansen]] criticised their performance, ending his analysis with the words, \"You can't win anything with kids.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/15527986 |work=BBC Sport |first=Alan |last=Hansen |title=Sir Alex Ferguson 25 years: 'You can't win anything with kids' |date=2 November 2011|accessdate=9 May 2013}}</ref> United won their next five matches and were boosted by the return of Cantona, who made his comeback against Liverpool in October 1995.

The gap increased to 12 points, but a series of wins, coupled with Newcastle dropping points, meant by late March, United moved to the top of the table.

The plan called for two of the first-stage engines to shut down to reduce the rocket's acceleration at approximately 2 minutes 30 seconds into the flight when the Falcon 9 would nominally be {{convert|90|km|mi}} high and traveling at 10 times the speed of sound. The remaining engines were planned to cut off shortly after\u2014an event known as main-engine cutoff (MECO). Five seconds after MECO, the first and second stages separate. Seven seconds later, the second stage's single Merlin vacuum engine was projected to ignite to begin a 6-minute, 14-second burn to put Dragon into [[low-Earth orbit]]. Forty seconds after second-stage ignition, Dragon's protective nose cone, which covers Dragon's berthing mechanism, was planned to be jettisoned. At the 9-minute, 14-second mark after launch, the second-stage engine was scheduled to cut off (SECO). Thirty-five seconds later, Dragon was planned to separate from Falcon 9's second stage and reach its preliminary orbit. The dragon would, per plan, then deploy its solar arrays and open its guidance and navigation control (GNC) bay door which holds the sensors necessary for rendezvous and Dragon's [[Power Data Grapple Fixture|grapple fixture]].<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>\n\n=== Flight day 2 (9 October) ===\nThe mission plan called for the Dragon spacecraft to perform a coelliptic burn that would place it in a circular [[coelliptic orbit]].<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>\n\n=== Flight day 3 (10 October) ===\nAs Dragon chased the [[International Space Station]], the spacecraft established UHF communication using its COTS Ultra-high-frequency Communication Unit (CUCU). Also, using the crew command panel (CCP) onboard the station, the expedition crew monitored the approach. This ability for the crew to send commands to Dragon is important during the rendezvous and departure phases of the mission.<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>\n\nDuring the final approach to the station, a go/no-go was performed by [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center#FCR 1 (2006-present)|Mission Control Houston]] and the SpaceX team in Hawthorne to allow Dragon to perform another engine burn that brought it {{convert|250|m|ft}} from the station. At this distance, Dragon began using its close-range guidance systems, composed of [[LIDAR]] and thermal imagers. These systems confirmed that Dragon's position and velocity are accurate by comparing the LIDAR image that Dragon receives against Dragon's thermal imagers. The Dragon flight control team in Hawthorne, with assistance from the NASA flight control team at the Johnson Space Center's International Space Station Flight Control Room, commanded the spacecraft to approach the station from its hold position. After another go/no-go was performed by the Houston and Hawthorne teams, Dragon was permitted to enter the Keep-Out Sphere (KOS), an imaginary sphere drawn {{convert|200|m|ft}} around the station that reduces the risk of collision. Dragon proceeded to a position {{convert|30|m|ft}} from the station and was automatically held. Another go/no-go was completed. Then Dragon proceeded to the {{convert|10|m|ft}} position \u2014 the capture point. A final go/no-go was performed, and the Mission Control Houston team notified the crew they were going for the capture of Dragon.<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>\n\nAt that point, Expedition 33 crewmember [[Akihiko Hoshide]] of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency used the station's {{convert|17.6|m|ft}} robotic arm, known as [[Mobile Servicing System#Canadarm2 |Canadarm2]], reached for and grappled the Dragon spacecraft at 10:56 UTC.<ref name=SPACENOW10/> Hoshide, with the help of Expedition 33 Commander [[Sunita Williams]] of NASA, guided Dragon to the Earth-facing side of the station's [[Harmony module]]. Williams and Hoshide swapped places and Williams gently berthed Dragon to Harmony's [[Common Berthing Mechanism]] at 13:03 UTC.<ref name=SPACENOW10/>\n\nThe opening of the hatch between Dragon and the Harmony module, which was originally not scheduled to occur until 11 October, was moved up and occurred at 17:40 UTC.<ref name=SPACENOW10/>\n\n=== Remainder of mission (11 to 28 October) ===\n[[File:SpX CRS-1 berthed - cropped.jpg|thumb|right|A Dragon as seen from [[Cupola (ISS module)|Cupola]] on 14 October 2012.]]\n\nOver a period of two and a half weeks, the ISS crew unloaded Dragon's payload and reloaded it with cargo for return to Earth.<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>{{Failed verification|date=November 2012}}<!-- a source from before the flight does not confirm that the planned event became a past-tense historical fact; needs a better source, or the prose needs to speak to the mission plan as outlined in the presskit -->\n\nAfter its mission at the orbital laboratory was completed, newly arrived Expedition 33 Flight Engineer [[Kevin A. Ford|Kevin Ford]] used the Canadarm2 robotic arm to detach Dragon from Harmony, maneuver it out to the 15-meter (50-foot) release point, and release the vehicle. Dragon then performed a series of three burns to place it on a trajectory away from the station. Approximately six hours after Dragon departed the station, it conducted a deorbit burn, which lasted up to 10 minutes. Dragon's trunk, which contains its solar arrays, was then jettisoned.<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>{{Failed verification|date=November 2012}}<!-- a source from before the flight does not confirm that the planned event became a past-tense historical fact; needs a better source, or the prose needs to speak to the mission plan as outlined in the presskit -->\n[[File:SpX-1 Dragon at port.1.jpg|thumb|left|The SpX-1 capsule seen back at port on 30 October 2012]]\nThe landing was controlled by automatic firing of its [[Draco (rocket engine family)#Draco|Draco]] thrusters during [[Atmospheric entry|reentry]].{{Failed verification|date=November 2012}}<!-- a source from before the flight does not confirm that the planned event became a past-tense historical fact; needs a better source, or the prose needs to speak to the mission plan as outlined in the presskit --> In a carefully timed sequence of events, dual [[drogue parachute]]s deploy at an altitude of {{convert|13700|m|ft|abbr=on}} to stabilize and slow the spacecraft. Full deployment of the drogues triggers the release of the three main parachutes, each 35 meters (116 feet) in diameter, at about {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. While the drogues detach from the spacecraft, the main parachutes further slow the spacecraft's descent to approximately {{convert|4.8|to|5.4|m/s|ft/s|sp=us}}. Even if Dragon were to lose one of its main parachutes, the two remaining chutes would still permit a safe landing. The Dragon capsule is expected to land in the Pacific Ocean, about {{convert|450|km|mi|abbr=on}} off the coast of southern California. SpaceX uses a 100-foot boat equipped with an A-frame and an articulating crane, a 90-foot crew boat for telemetry operations, and two 24-foot rigid-hull inflatable boats to perform recovery operations.

As a result, the flight computer commanded shutdown of engine 1 and Falcon 9 continued on its path to ensure Dragon's entry into orbit for subsequent rendezvous and berthing with the ISS.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aviationweek.com/blog/spacex-engine-anomaly-overview |title=SpaceX: Engine Anomaly Overview |publisher=Aviationweek.com |date= |accessdate=8 October 2013}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Spaceflight}}\n* [[List of Falcon 9 launches]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist |colwidth=30em |refs=\n\n<ref name=HARTMAN>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/672214main_1-Hartman_July12_NAC_Final_508.pdf |title=International Space Station Program Status |last=Hartman |first=Dan |date=23 July 2012 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Presskit\">\n{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/694166main_SpaceXCRS-1PressKit.pdf |title=SpX CRS-1 Mission Press Kit |date=4 October 2012 |publisher=NASA, SpaceX, 45th Space Wing |accessdate=6 October 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"SpaceX Launch Manifest\">\n{{cite web |title=SpaceX Launch Manifest |publisher=SpaceX |url=http://www.spacex.com/launch_manifest.php |accessdate=31 May 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"NASA Launch Schedule\">\n{{cite web |title=NASA's Consolidated Launch Schedule |publisher=NASA |url=http://www.nasa.gov/missions/highlights/schedule.html |accessdate=21 June 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"NASAsept20\">\n{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/spacex-crs1-target.html |title=SpaceX, NASA Target Oct. 7 Launch For Resupply Mission To Space Station |date=20 September 2012 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=26 September 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Clark 18 May 2012\">\n{{cite web |last=Clark |first=Stephen |date=18 May 2012 |title=SpaceX's historic commercial mission is 'just a test flight' |publisher=SpaceFlightNow |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/falcon9/003/120518commercial/ |accessdate=25 August 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=ClarkOct28>{{cite web |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/falcon9/004/121028splashdown/#.UI_fCIa_PKg |title=Return of the Dragon: Commercial craft back home |last=Clark |first=Stephen |date=28 October 2012 |publisher=SpaceFlightNow |accessdate=30 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Clark 24 August 2012\">\n{{cite web |title=NASA ready for operational cargo flights by SpaceX |last=Clark |first=Stephen |date=24 August 2012 |publisher=SpaceFlightNow |url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1208/24cots/ |accessdate=25 August 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=SPACENOW10>{{cite web |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/falcon9/004/121010arrival/ |title=Dragon arrives at station with commercial delivery |last=Clark |first=Stephen |date=10 October 2012 |publisher=SpaceFlightNow |accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Orbcomm 25 May 2012\">\n{{cite press |title=Orbcomm Eagerly Awaits Launch of New Satellite on Next Falcon 9 |date=25 May 2012 |publisher=Space News |url=http://www.spacenews.com/satellite_telecom/120525-spacex-success-welcome-orbcomm.html |accessdate=28 May 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Hartman 23 July 2012\">\n{{cite web |last=Hartman |first=Dan |date=23 July 2012 |title=International Space Station Program Status |publisher=NASA |url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/672214main_1-Hartman_July12_NAC_Final_508.pdf |accessdate=28 August 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Sept29\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/09/falcon-9-hot-fires-engines-iss-prepares-dragons-arrival/ |title=Falcon 9 hot fires its engines as the ISS prepares for Dragon's arrival |last=Bergin |first=Chris |date=29 September 2012 |publisher=NASASpaceFlight (not associated with NASA) |accessdate=29 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AugustChris\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/08/spacex-conduct-successful-wdr-falcon-9/ |title=SpaceX conduct successful WDR on their latest Falcon 9 |last=Bergin |first=Chris |date=31 August 2012 |publisher=NASASpaceFlight (not associated with NASA) |accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|SpaceX CRS-1}}\n*[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/living/launch/index.html SpaceX CRS-1 NASA page]\n*[http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/694166main_SpaceXCRS-1PressKit.pdf SpaceX CRS-1 Mission Press Kit (4 October 2012)]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I7loLnDYyU Video of Static Fire test -

Forty seconds after second-stage ignition, Dragon's protective nose cone, which covers Dragon's berthing mechanism, was planned to be jettisoned. At the 9-minute, 14-second mark after launch, the second-stage engine was scheduled to cut off (SECO). Thirty-five seconds later, Dragon was planned to separate from Falcon 9's second stage and reach its preliminary orbit. The dragon would, per plan, then deploy its solar arrays and open its guidance and navigation control (GNC) bay door which holds the sensors necessary for rendezvous and Dragon's [[Power Data Grapple Fixture|grapple fixture]].<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>\n\n=== Flight day 2 (9 October) ===\nThe mission plan called for the Dragon spacecraft to perform a coelliptic burn that would place it in a circular [[coelliptic orbit]].<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>\n\n=== Flight day 3 (10 October) ===\nAs Dragon chased the [[International Space Station]], the spacecraft established UHF communication using its COTS Ultra-high-frequency Communication Unit (CUCU). Also, using the crew command panel (CCP) onboard the station, the expedition crew monitored the approach. This ability for the crew to send commands to Dragon is important during the rendezvous and departure phases of the mission.<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>\n\nDuring the final approach to the station, a go/no-go was performed by [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center#FCR 1 (2006-present)|Mission Control Houston]] and the SpaceX team in Hawthorne to allow Dragon to perform another engine burn that brought it {{convert|250|m|ft}} from the station. At this distance, Dragon began using its close-range guidance systems, composed of [[LIDAR]] and thermal imagers. These systems confirmed that Dragon's position and velocity are accurate by comparing the LIDAR image that Dragon receives against Dragon's thermal imagers. The Dragon flight control team in Hawthorne, with assistance from the NASA flight control team at the Johnson Space Center's International Space Station Flight Control Room, commanded the spacecraft to approach the station from its hold position. After another go/no-go was performed by the Houston and Hawthorne teams, Dragon was permitted to enter the Keep-Out Sphere (KOS), an imaginary sphere drawn {{convert|200|m|ft}} around the station that reduces the risk of collision. Dragon proceeded to a position {{convert|30|m|ft}} from the station and was automatically held. Another go/no-go was completed. Then Dragon proceeded to the {{convert|10|m|ft}} position \u2014 the capture point. A final go/no-go was performed, and the Mission Control Houston team notified the crew they were going for the capture of Dragon.<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>\n\nAt that point, Expedition 33 crewmember [[Akihiko Hoshide]] of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency used the station's {{convert|17.6|m|ft}} robotic arm, known as [[Mobile Servicing System#Canadarm2 |Canadarm2]], reached for and grappled the Dragon spacecraft at 10:56 UTC.<ref name=SPACENOW10/> Hoshide, with the help of Expedition 33 Commander [[Sunita Williams]] of NASA, guided Dragon to the Earth-facing side of the station's [[Harmony module]]. Williams and Hoshide swapped places and Williams gently berthed Dragon to Harmony's [[Common Berthing Mechanism]] at 13:03 UTC.<ref name=SPACENOW10/>\n\nThe opening of the hatch between Dragon and the Harmony module, which was originally not scheduled to occur until 11 October, was moved up and occurred at 17:40 UTC.<ref name=SPACENOW10/>\n\n=== Remainder of mission (11 to 28 October) ===\n[[File:SpX CRS-1 berthed - cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Dragon as seen from [[Cupola (ISS module)|Cupola]] on 14 October 2012]]\nOver a period of two and a half weeks, the ISS crew unloaded Dragon's payload and reloaded it with cargo for return to Earth.<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>{{Failed verification|date=November 2012}}<!-- a source from before the flight does not confirm that the planned event became a past-tense historical fact; needs a better source, or the prose needs to speak to the mission plan as outlined in the presskit -->\n\nAfter its mission at the orbital laboratory was completed, newly arrived Expedition 33 Flight Engineer [[Kevin A. Ford|Kevin Ford]] used the Canadarm2 robotic arm to detach Dragon from Harmony, maneuver it out to the 15-meter (50-foot) release point, and release the vehicle. Dragon then performed a series of three burns to place it on a trajectory away from the station. Approximately six hours after Dragon departed the station, it conducted a deorbit burn, which lasted up to 10 minutes. Dragon's trunk, which contains its solar arrays, was then jettisoned.<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>{{Failed verification|date=November 2012}}<!-- a source from before the flight does not confirm that the planned event became a past-tense historical fact; needs a better source, or the prose needs to speak to the mission plan as outlined in the presskit -->\n[[File:SpX-1 Dragon at port.1.jpg|thumb|left|The SpX-1 capsule seen back at port on 30 October 2012]]\nThe landing was controlled by automatic firing of its [[Draco (rocket engine family)#Draco|Draco]] thrusters during [[Atmospheric entry|reentry]].{{Failed verification|date=November 2012}}<!-- a source from before the flight does not confirm that the planned event became a past-tense historical fact; needs a better source, or the prose needs to speak to the mission plan as outlined in the presskit --> In a carefully timed sequence of events, dual [[drogue parachute]]s deploy at an altitude of {{convert|13700|m|ft|abbr=on}} to stabilize and slow the spacecraft.

While the drogues detach from the spacecraft, the main parachutes further slow the spacecraft's descent to approximately {{convert|4.8|to|5.4|m/s|ft/s|sp=us}}. Even if Dragon were to lose one of its main parachutes, the two remaining chutes would still permit a safe landing. The Dragon capsule is expected to land in the Pacific Ocean, about {{convert|450|km|mi|abbr=on}} off the coast of southern California. SpaceX uses a 100-foot boat equipped with an A-frame and an articulating crane, a 90-foot crew boat for telemetry operations, and two 24-foot rigid-hull inflatable boats to perform recovery operations. On board are approximately a dozen SpaceX engineers and technicians as well as a four-person dive team. Once the Dragon capsule splashed down, the recovery team secured the vehicle and then placed it on deck for the journey back to shore.{{Failed verification|date=November 2012}}<!-- a source from before the flight does not confirm that the planned event became a past-tense historical fact; needs a better source, or the prose needs to speak to the mission plan as outlined in the presskit --><ref name=\"Presskit\"/>\n\nSpaceX technicians opened the side hatch of the vehicle and retrieved the time-critical items.

It is important to appreciate that Orbcomm understood from the beginning that the orbit-raising maneuver was tentative.

A typical day in Yeshiva will include two sessions of intensive Talmud study (''iyun'') and one of extensive study (''bekiut''). \n\nShachris at the Yeshiva is at 6:30am, followed by halachah seder until 8:00am. Breakfast is from 8:00am-8:30am. After breakfast is morning seder, which is typically gemara iyun, and it goes from 8:30am-1:00pm. Following morning seder is lunch and a break from 1:00pm-3pm. Mincha is at 3:00pm, followed by afternoon seder, from about 3:20pm-7:30pm. Afternoon seder consists of more iyun gemara, followed by a couple hours of emmunah. Many of the students use the entire afternoon seder for learning machshava, tanach, mussar, and emmunah. From 7:30pm-8:00pm is Maariv, followed by supper from 8:00pm-8:30pm. Night seder consists of learning bekiut, and it goes from 8:30pm until at least 11:00pm, although there is no given time for night seder to end, and many students learn until much later.[[File:Hayeshiva.jpg|thumb|Lunch room of the Yeshiva]]'''Daily Schedule''': \n\nShachrit: 6:30am-8:00am\n\nBreakfast: 8:00am-8:30am\n\nMorning seder: 8:30am-1:00pm\n\nLunch/break: 1:00pm-3:00pm\n\nMincha: 3:00pm-3:20pm\n\nAfternoon seder: 3:20pm-7:30pm\n\nSupper: 7:30pm-8:00pm\n\nMarriv: 8:00pm-8:30pm \n\nNight seder: 8:30pm-11:00pm (or later)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.yhy.co.il/content/blogcategory/26/46/lang,he/|title=\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05ea \u05d4\u05d4\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8 \u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05d7\u05dd|last=|first=|date=|website=www.yhy.co.il|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-30}}</ref>\n\nIn terms of the afternoon seder, the yeshiva guides its students to base their perspective upon the teachings of [[Yehuda Halevi|Rabbi Yehuda Halevi]] and the [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel|Maharal of Prague]] in accordance with the ideology of [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], as is often customary in Religious Zionist yeshivas. With the goal of educating students to deal independently with the challenges they face living as an observant Jews in modern time in mind, the yeshiva encourages a broader study of Biblical, rabbinic, and other classical and modern sources. Hence, the yeshiva curriculum contains weekly classes in [[Tanakh]], [[Jewish philosophy]], [[Hasidic philosophy]], and the works of Jewish scholars such as [[Maimonides]], [[Nachmanides]], [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]], [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]], [[Abraham Isaac Kook]] and many more.\n\n==Educational approach==\nThe yeshiva educates its students to be aware of their surroundings and attentive to the needs of society in general. The yeshiva believes that the keys to solving Israel\u2019s socioeconomic gaps lie in integration and education. All the students volunteer in the community mainly in the field of education. Many of the yeshiva's alumni settle in Yeruham instead of heading to the country's central cities.\n\nThe yeshiva also promotes other programs, among them:\n* ''Ye'adim'' (goals) - Concern of the Ethiopian Jewry in Israel's situation led Yerucham students to create a leadership training program for Ethiopian students with the intention of their returning to their communities. During the 5 years of Hesder the students synchronize their full Yeshiva studies with a [[Bachelor of Education|B.Ed.]] degree in [[Herzog College]].\n* Young Study Partners - First and second year students dedicate 2 hours weekly to studying Torah subjects with children from the local elementary school. They also serve as positive role models for the local youth and look to form a connection with their families.\n* Charity Fund - The goal of the Fund is to help the needy of Yeruham become self-sufficient and better managers of their money. The Fund uses the cooperation of the local welfare and professional financial advisors to this end.\n* ''B'levav Shalem'' Yeshiva High School \u2013 Because of the lack of high quality religious high schools in the [[Negev]], and as a part of the integration program the Hesder Yeshiva believes in, it was decided by alumni, residents of Yerucham, to open a Yeshiva High School for the local and general population.\n\n==Educational staff==\n[[File:\u05d4\u05e8\u05d1 \u05d1\u05dc\u05d5\u05de\u05e0\u05e6\u05d5\u05d9\u05d2.JPG|thumb|Rabbi Blumenzweig]]\nIn addition to [[:he:\u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5_\u05d1\u05dc\u05d5\u05de\u05e0\u05e6\u05d5\u05d9\u05d2|Rabbi Blumenzweig]], the other rabbis who teach in the Yeshiva are  Rabbi [[Uriel Eitam]], Rabbi Chaim Wolfson, Rabbi Shai Gnizi, Rabbi Shmuel Gleizer, Rabbi Achiya Ben Pazi, Rabbi Asher Weiss, Rabbi Ido Heber, Rabbi Shmuel Ariel, and Rabbi Elyakim Sharir<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.yhy.co.il/content/blogcategory/33/51/lang,he/|title=\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05ea \u05d4\u05d4\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8 \u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05d7\u05dd - \u05e6\u05d5\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d4|website=www.yhy.co.il|access-date=2019-12-30}}</ref>.

A typical day in Yeshiva will include two sessions of intensive Talmud study (''iyun'') and one of extensive study (''bekiut''). \n\nShachris at the Yeshiva is at 6:30am, followed by halachah seder until 8:00am. Breakfast is from 8:00am-8:30am. After breakfast is morning seder, which is typically gemara iyun, and it goes from 8:30am-1:00pm. Following morning seder is lunch and a break from 1:00pm-3pm. Mincha is at 3:00pm, followed by afternoon seder, from about 3:20pm-7:30pm. Afternoon seder consists of more iyun gemara, followed by a couple hours of emmunah. Many of the students use the entire afternoon seder for learning machshava, tanach, mussar, and emmunah. From 7:30pm-8:00pm is Maariv, followed by supper from 8:00pm-8:30pm. Night seder consists of learning bekiut, and it goes from 8:30pm until at least 11:00pm, although there is no given time for night seder to end, and many students learn until much later.[[File:Hayeshiva.jpg|thumb|Lunch room of the Yeshiva]]'''Daily Schedule''': \n\nShachrit: 6:30am-8:00am\n\nBreakfast: 8:00am-8:30am\n\nMorning seder: 8:30am-1:00pm\n\nLunch/break: 1:00pm-3:00pm\n\nMincha: 3:00pm-3:20pm\n\nAfternoon seder: 3:20pm-7:30pm\n\nSupper: 7:30pm-8:00pm\n\nMarriv: 8:00pm-8:30pm \n\nNight seder: 8:30pm-11:00pm (or later)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.yhy.co.il/content/blogcategory/26/46/lang,he/|title=\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05ea \u05d4\u05d4\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8 \u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05d7\u05dd|last=|first=|date=|website=www.yhy.co.il|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-30}}</ref>\n\nIn terms of the afternoon seder, the yeshiva guides its students to base their perspective upon the teachings of [[Yehuda Halevi|Rabbi Yehuda Halevi]] and the [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel|Maharal of Prague]] in accordance with the ideology of [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], as is often customary in Religious Zionist yeshivas. With the goal of educating students to deal independently with the challenges they face living as an observant Jews in modern time in mind, the yeshiva encourages a broader study of Biblical, rabbinic, and other classical and modern sources. Hence, the yeshiva curriculum contains weekly classes in [[Tanakh]], [[Jewish philosophy]], [[Hasidic philosophy]], and the works of Jewish scholars such as [[Maimonides]], [[Nachmanides]], [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]], [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]], [[Abraham Isaac Kook]] and many more.\n\n==Educational approach==\nThe yeshiva educates its students to be aware of their surroundings and attentive to the needs of society in general. The yeshiva believes that the keys to solving Israel\u2019s socioeconomic gaps lie in integration and education. All the students volunteer in the community mainly in the field of education. Many of the yeshiva's alumni settle in Yeruham instead of heading to the country's central cities.\n\nThe yeshiva also promotes other programs, among them:\n* ''Ye'adim'' (goals) - Concern of the Ethiopian Jewry in Israel's situation led Yerucham students to create a leadership training program for Ethiopian students with the intention of their returning to their communities. During the 5 years of Hesder the students synchronize their full Yeshiva studies with a [[Bachelor of Education|B.Ed.]] degree in [[Herzog College]].\n* Young Study Partners - First and second year students dedicate 2 hours weekly to studying Torah subjects with children from the local elementary school. They also serve as positive role models for the local youth and look to form a connection with their families.\n* Charity Fund - The goal of the Fund is to help the needy of Yeruham become self-sufficient and better managers of their money. The Fund uses the cooperation of the local welfare and professional financial advisors to this end.\n* ''B'levav Shalem'' Yeshiva High School \u2013 Because of the lack of high quality religious high schools in the [[Negev]], and as a part of the integration program the Hesder Yeshiva believes in, it was decided by alumni, residents of Yerucham, to open a Yeshiva High School for the local and general population.\n\n==Educational staff==\n[[File:\u05d4\u05e8\u05d1 \u05d1\u05dc\u05d5\u05de\u05e0\u05e6\u05d5\u05d9\u05d2.JPG|thumb|Rabbi Blumenzweig]]\nIn addition to [[:he:\u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5_\u05d1\u05dc\u05d5\u05de\u05e0\u05e6\u05d5\u05d9\u05d2|Rabbi Blumenzweig]], the other rabbis who teach in the Yeshiva are  Rabbi [[Uriel Eitam]], Rabbi Chaim Wolfson, Rabbi Shai Gnizi, Rabbi Shmuel Gleizer, Rabbi Achiya Ben Pazi, Rabbi Shmuel Ariel and Rabbi Elyakim Sharir<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.yhy.co.il/content/blogcategory/33/51/lang,he/|title=\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05ea \u05d4\u05d4\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8 \u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05d7\u05dd - \u05e6\u05d5\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d4|website=www.yhy.co.il|access-date=2019-12-30}}</ref>.

During the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]], he was awarded the [[Navy Cross]] for leading a 40-man patrol to the top of [[Mount Suribachi]], where he helped raise the first of two [[United States]] [[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima#Raising the first flag|flag]]s on February 23, 1945. He was wounded in [[North Korea]] during the [[Battle of Chosin Reservoir]] while commanding a rifle company.\n\nThe first flag flown over the southern end of Iwo Jima was regarded to be too small to be seen by the thousands of Marines fighting on the other side of the mountain where the Japanese airfields and most of their troops were located, so it was replaced the same day with a larger flag. Although there were photographs taken of the first flag flying on Mount Suribachi and some which include Schrier, there was no photograph taken of Marines raising the first flag. Schrier was also photographed near the second flag after it was raised. The [[Raising the flag on Iwo Jima|second-flag raising]] has generally been portrayed as the only flag-raising on Mount Suribachi ever since the famous photograph of it which was taken by [[Associated Press]] combat photographer [[Joe Rosenthal]], appeared in the newspapers.<ref>https://www.pulitzer.org/article/joe-rosenthal-and-flag-raising-iwo-jima</ref>\n\nIn 1949, Schrier appeared as himself in the war movie \"Sands of Iwo Jima\", where he hands the American flag to actor [[John Wayne]] (as Sergeant Stryker).\n\nThe [[Marine Corps War Memorial]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]], is modeled after the historic photograph of the second-flag raising and depicts the six flag raisers. \n\n==Early years==\nSchrier was born in [[Corder, Missouri]], on October 17, 1916. He attended high school in [[Lexington, Missouri]].\n\nHe was a yanky doodle flag waver in second battalion marine corp A patch\n\n==U.S. Marine Corps career==\nSchrier enlisted in the Marine Corps on November 12, 1936. After [[United States Marine Corps Recruit Training|recruit training]] at the [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego|Marine Corps Recruit Depot]] in [[San Diego, California]], he was sent to China as a [[US Embassy]] guard in [[Beijing]]. He also served in [[Tientsin Incident|Tientsin]] and [[Shanghai]]. In August 1940, he became a [[Drill Instructor#U.S. Marine Corps|drill instructor]] at the [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego]].\n\n===World War II===\nIn early 1942, Schrier joined the 2nd [[Marine Raider]] Battalion at [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego|Camp Elliott, San Diego]], being promoted to [[platoon sergeant]] in April 1942. In June 1942, he was part of two 2nd Raider Battalion companies that were sent to [[Battle of Midway|Midway Island]] to bolster the garrison there. He participated in the [[Battle of Guadalcanal]] and found himself taking part in the 2nd Marine Raider Battalion's epic [[Carlson's patrol|\"Long Patrol\"]] behind enemy lines from November to December 1942. During this action, he distinguished himself by leading part of his cut off company to safety after his company commander erroneously led them into a hostile situation. In early 1943, he was promoted to [[second lieutenant]] in the field. Subsequently, he was detached to other duties within the Raider organization, such as observation and reconnaissance on enemy-held islands before larger units made assault landings. He was awarded the [[Legion of Merit]] for his work at [[Vangunu|Vangunu Island]] during the [[New Georgia Campaign]] in June 1943. He also served at [[Bougainville Campaign|Bougainville]] in support of military actions there. In February 1944, after the Marine Raiders were disbanded, he returned to the United States to become an [[infantry]] instructor at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton]]. He was assigned next to be the executive officer of E Company, [[2nd Battalion, 28th Marine Regiment]], [[5th Marine Division]]. In September, the 5th Division left Camp Pendleton for [[Hawaii]], for further training. In January 1945, the 5th Division left Hawaii for the assault and capture of Iwo Jima.\n\n====Iwo Jima====\n[[File:Iwo Jima Suribachi DN-SD-03-11845.JPEG|thumb|right|Mount Suribachi on Iwo Jima]]\nOn February 19, 1945, Lt.

Because of heavy fighting, the base of Mount Suribachi was not reached and surrounded until February 22.\n[[File:First Iwo Jima Flag Raising.jpg|220px|thumb|Marine Staff Sergeant [[Louis R.

Captain Dave Severance, E Company's commander, assembled the remainder of his Third Platoon and other members of the battalion headquarters, including two Navy [[Hospital corpsman|corpsmen]] and stretcher bearers. First Lieutenant [[Harold G. Schrier#Navy Cross|Harold Schrier]], E Company's executive officer, volunteered for the mission and was handed the Second Battalion's American flag from Lt. Colonel Johnson (or the battalion adjutant) measuring 28 by 54 inches (137 by 71&nbsp;cm), which had been taken from the attack transport {{USS|Missoula|APA-211}} on the way to Iwo Jima by First Lieutenant George G. Wells, the Second Battalion's adjutant in charge of the battalion's flags.<ref>\"The Man Who Carried the Flag on Iwo Jima\", by G. Greeley Wells, New York Times, October 17, 1991, p. A-26</ref> Lt. Schrier was to take a patrol with the flag up the mountain and raise the flag if possible at the summit to signal that Mount Suribachi was captured. At 8:30&nbsp;a.m., Lt. Schrier started climbing with the patrol up the mountain. Less than an hour later, the patrol, after receiving occasional Japanese sniper fire, reached the rim of the volcano. After a brief firefight there, Lt. Schrier and his men captured the summit.\n\nA long section of a Japanese steel water pipe was found on the mountain and the battalion's flag was tied on to it by Lt. Schrier, Sgt.

Col. Johnson determined that a larger flag should replace it. The flag was too small to be seen on the other side of the mountain where three Japanese airfields and most of the Japanese troops were located, and Johnson thought that the thousands of Marines fighting there needed the inspiration from seeing the flag. A 96 by 56 inch flag was obtained from a ship docked on shore and brought up to the top of Mount Suribachi by Pfc. [[Rene Gagnon]] the Second Battalion's runner (messenger) for E Company. At the same time, Sgt. [[Michael Strank]], Cpl. [[Harlon Block]], Pfc. [[Franklin Sousley]], and Pfc. [[Ira Hayes]] from Second Platoon, E Company, were sent to take communication wire or supplies up to the Third Platoon and raise the second flag.

The [[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima|black and white photograph of the second flag raising]] by [[Joe Rosenthal]] of the [[Associated Press]] became world-famous after appearing in the newspapers as the flag raising on Iwo Jima.  Marine combat photographer Sergeant [[Bill Genaust|William Genaust]], who had accompanied Rosenthal and Marine photographer Pvt. Robert Campbell up Mount Suribachi, filmed the second flag raising in color and it was used in [[newsreel]]s.<ref name=\"youtube.com\">You Tube, Smithsonian Channel, 2008 Documentary (Genaust films) \"Shooting Iwo Jima\" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOy6yRAB6BY] Retrieved April 1, 2020</ref> Other combat photographers ascended the mountain after the first flag was raised and the mountaintop secured. These photographers including Rosenthal and an army photographer who was assigned to cover Marine amphibious landings for [[Yank, the Army Weekly|Yank Magazine]], took photos of Marines (including Sgt. Hansen), corpsmen, and themselves around both of the flags. The second flag-raisers received national recognition. After the replacement flag was raised, sixteen Marines, including Schrier and Hansen, and two Navy corpsmen ([[John Bradley (United States Navy)|John Bradley]] and Gerald Ziehme from the 40-man patrol) posed together for Rosenthal around the base of the flagstaff.\n\nOn February 27, Schrier left Mount Suribachi and became the commander of D Company, 2nd Battalion, 28th Marines. He was later awarded the [[Silver Star|Silver Star Medal]] for leading a successful counterattack on March 24 against a large number of fanatical Japanese soldiers who attacked the rear position of his lightly manned command post.\n\nOn March 14, another American flag was officially raised up a flagpole by two Marines under the orders of Lt. Gen. Holland Smith during a ceremony at the [[V Amphibious Corps]] command post on the other side of Mount Suribachi where the [[3rd Marine Division (United States)|3rd Marine Division]] troops were located. The flag flying on the summit of Mount Suribachi since February 23 was taken down. On March 26, 1945, the island was considered secure and the battle of Iwo Jima was officially ended. Lt. Schrier and the 28th Marines left Iwo Jima on March 27 and returned to Hawaii to the 5th Marine Division training camp. Lt. Col. Johnson was killed in action on March 2, Sgt. Genaust was killed on March 4, Sgt. Strank and Cpl. Block were killed on March 1, and Pfc. Sousley was killed on March 21.\n\nLt. Schrier served in San Diego from July to October 1945. Afterwards, he served in [[Seal Beach, California]], [[Samar]], [[Philippines]], and in [[United States Fleet Activities Yokosuka|Yokosuka]], [[Japan]]. In 1949, Captain Schrier returned to the United States and was assigned as a technical advisor (he also appeared as himself with flag raiser Ira Hayes and former corpsman John Bradley) in the motion picture ''[[Sands of Iwo Jima]]'', starring John Wayne.\n\n===Korean War===\nThe [[Korean War]] broke out on June 25, 1950, and Captain Schrier was sent to Korea with the [[1st Provisional Marine Brigade]] in July. He was awarded the [[Bronze Star Medal]] for his actions while serving as the brigade adjutant in August and September during the [[Battle of Pusan Perimeter]] in [[South Korea]]. He was assigned next as the company commander of I Company, [[3rd Battalion, 5th Marines]], [[1st Marine Division]]. During the [[Battle of Chosin Reservoir]] in [[North Korea]], he was wounded in the neck on December 1, during an all-night hill fight at Hill 1520 with Chinese Communist troops.

On the morning of 23 February when his combat team had advanced to the base of Mount Suribachi after four days of severe fighting, First Lieutenant SCHRIER volunteered to lead a forty-man patrol up the steep slopes of the mountain. Quickly organizing his patrol and placing himself at its head, he began the tortuous climb up the side of the volcano, followed by his patrol in single file. Employing the only known approach, an old Japanese trail, he swiftly pushed on until, covered by all the supporting weapons of his battalion, he gained the top of the mountain despite hostile small arms and artillery fire. Forced to engage the remaining enemy in a sharp fire fight, he overcame them without loss in his patrol and occupied the rim of the volcano. Although still under enemy sniper fire, First Lieutenant SCHRIER, assisted by his Platoon Sergeant, raised the National Colors over Mount Suribachi, planting the flagstaff firmly on the highest knoll overlooking the crater, the first American flag to fly over any land in the inner defenses of the Japanese Empire. His inspiring leadership, courage and determination in the face of overwhelming odds upheld the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.\"\n<center>For the President,<br />JOHN L.

Realizing the seriousness of the situation when a group of approximately one hundred Japanese infiltrated through the main defensive positions shortly after midnight and launched a fanatical attack against the rear of his lightly-manned command post, First Lieutenant Schrier boldly rallied his men and opposed the onrushing enemy, setting a courageous example. His leadership and fighting spirit throughout this action were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service. For the President, John L.

Preceding the landing of our invasion forces, Second Lieutenant Schrier with his party made his way by canoe to the enemy-held Vangunu Island and for two days, in the face of extreme danger, stayed close to the hostile lines in order to observe troop concentrations, bivouac areas, possible gun positions and trails. When the other members of his party left, he dauntlessly remained in the Japanese-infested area and nine days later flashed signals to the approaching ships and guided troops to the beach. By his fearless devotion to duty in supplying accurate and vital information to the commanding officers, Second Lieutenant Schrier contributed materially to the capture of the area and upheld the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.\nGeneral Orders: Heroes U.S. Marine Corps, 1861 \u2013 1955: Jane Blakeney\nAction Date: June 13 \u2013 30, 1943\nService: Marine Corps\nRank: Second Lieutenant\nRegiment: 1st Marine Raider Regiment\n\nhttp://valor.militarytimes.com/recipient.php?recipientid=8139\n\n==Portrayal in films==\n* [[Sands of Iwo Jima]], 1949 (Capt.

During the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]], he was awarded the [[Navy Cross]] for leading a 40-man patrol to the top of [[Mount Suribachi]], where he helped raise the first of two [[United States]] [[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima#Raising the first flag|flag]]s on February 23, 1945. He was wounded in [[North Korea]] during the [[Battle of Chosin Reservoir]] while commanding a rifle company.\n\nThe first flag flown over the southern end of Iwo Jima was regarded to be too small to be seen by the thousands of Marines fighting on the other side of the mountain where the Japanese airfields and most of their troops were located, so it was replaced the same day with a larger flag. Although there were photographs taken of the first flag flying on Mount Suribachi and some which include Schrier, there was no photograph taken of Marines raising the first flag. Schrier was also photographed near the second flag after it was raised. The [[Raising the flag on Iwo Jima|second-flag raising]] has generally been portrayed as the only flag-raising on Mount Suribachi ever since the famous photograph of it which was taken by [[Associated Press]] combat photographer [[Joe Rosenthal]], appeared in the newspapers.<ref>https://www.pulitzer.org/article/joe-rosenthal-and-flag-raising-iwo-jima</ref>\n\nIn 1949, Schrier appeared as himself in the war movie \"Sands of Iwo Jima\", where he hands the American flag to actor [[John Wayne]] (as Sergeant Stryker).\n\nThe [[Marine Corps War Memorial]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]], is modeled after the historic photograph of the second-flag raising and depicts the six flag raisers. \n\n==Early years==\nSchrier was born in [[Corder, Missouri]], on October 17, 1916. He attended high school in [[Lexington, Missouri]].\n\n==U.S. Marine Corps career==\nSchrier enlisted in the Marine Corps on November 12, 1936. After [[United States Marine Corps Recruit Training|recruit training]] at the [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego|Marine Corps Recruit Depot]] in [[San Diego, California]], he was sent to China as a [[US Embassy]] guard in [[Beijing]]. He also served in [[Tientsin Incident|Tientsin]] and [[Shanghai]]. In August 1940, he became a [[Drill Instructor#U.S. Marine Corps|drill instructor]] at the [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego]].\n\n===World War II===\nIn early 1942, Schrier joined the 2nd [[Marine Raider]] Battalion at [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego|Camp Elliott, San Diego]], being promoted to [[platoon sergeant]] in April 1942. In June 1942, he was part of two 2nd Raider Battalion companies that were sent to [[Battle of Midway|Midway Island]] to bolster the garrison there. He participated in the [[Battle of Guadalcanal]] and found himself taking part in the 2nd Marine Raider Battalion's epic [[Carlson's patrol|\"Long Patrol\"]] behind enemy lines from November to December 1942. During this action, he distinguished himself by leading part of his cut off company to safety after his company commander erroneously led them into a hostile situation. In early 1943, he was promoted to [[second lieutenant]] in the field. Subsequently, he was detached to other duties within the Raider organization, such as observation and reconnaissance on enemy-held islands before larger units made assault landings. He was awarded the [[Legion of Merit]] for his work at [[Vangunu|Vangunu Island]] during the [[New Georgia Campaign]] in June 1943. He also served at [[Bougainville Campaign|Bougainville]] in support of military actions there. In February 1944, after the Marine Raiders were disbanded, he returned to the United States to become an [[infantry]] instructor at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton]]. He was assigned next to be the executive officer of E Company, [[2nd Battalion, 28th Marine Regiment]], [[5th Marine Division]]. In September, the 5th Division left Camp Pendleton for [[Hawaii]], for further training. In January 1945, the 5th Division left Hawaii for the assault and capture of Iwo Jima.\n\n====Iwo Jima====\n[[File:Iwo Jima Suribachi DN-SD-03-11845.JPEG|thumb|right|Mount Suribachi on Iwo Jima]]\nOn February 19, 1945, Lt. Schrier and E Company landed with the fifth assault wave on the southeast beach of Iwo Jima closest to Mount Suribachi, which was the [[28th Marine Regiment]]'s objective. Because of heavy fighting, the base of Mount Suribachi was not reached and surrounded until February 22.\n[[File:First Iwo Jima Flag Raising.jpg|220px|thumb|Marine Staff Sergeant [[Louis R.

Captain Dave Severance, E Company's commander, assembled the remainder of his Third Platoon and other members of the battalion headquarters, including two Navy [[Hospital corpsman|corpsmen]] and stretcher bearers. First Lieutenant [[Harold G. Schrier#Navy Cross|Harold Schrier]], E Company's executive officer, volunteered for the mission and was handed the Second Battalion's American flag from Lt. Colonel Johnson (or the battalion adjutant) measuring 28 by 54 inches (137 by 71&nbsp;cm), which had been taken from the attack transport {{USS|Missoula|APA-211}} on the way to Iwo Jima by First Lieutenant George G. Wells, the Second Battalion's adjutant in charge of the battalion's flags.<ref>\"The Man Who Carried the Flag on Iwo Jima\", by G. Greeley Wells, New York Times, October 17, 1991, p. A-26</ref> Lt. Schrier was to take a patrol with the flag up the mountain and raise the flag if possible at the summit to signal that Mount Suribachi was captured. At 8:30&nbsp;a.m., Lt. Schrier started climbing with the patrol up the mountain. Less than an hour later, the patrol, after receiving occasional Japanese sniper fire, reached the rim of the volcano. After a brief firefight there, Lt. Schrier and his men captured the summit.\n\nA long section of a Japanese steel water pipe was found on the mountain and the battalion's flag was tied on to it by Lt. Schrier, Sgt. [[Henry Oliver Hansen|Henry Hansen]] and Cpl. [[Charles W. Lindberg|Charles Lindberg]] (Platoon Sergeant [[Ernest Ivy Thomas, Jr.|Ernest Thomas]] was watching inside the group with a grenade in his hand while Pvt. Phil Ward held the bottom of the pipe horizontally off the ground). The flagstaff was then carried to the highest part on the crater and raised by Lt. Schrier, Platoon Sgt. Thomas, Sgt.

Col. Johnson determined that a larger flag should replace it. The flag was too small to be seen on the other side of the mountain where three Japanese airfields and most of the Japanese troops were located, and Johnson thought that the thousands of Marines fighting there needed the inspiration from seeing the flag. A 96 by 56 inch flag was obtained from a ship docked on shore and brought up to the top of Mount Suribachi by Pfc. [[Rene Gagnon]] the Second Battalion's runner (messenger) for E Company. At the same time, Sgt. [[Michael Strank]], Cpl. [[Harlon Block]], Pfc. [[Franklin Sousley]], and Pfc. [[Ira Hayes]] from Second Platoon, E Company, were sent to take communication wire or supplies up to the Third Platoon and raise the second flag. Once on top, the flag was attached to another Japanese steel pipe. Shortly before 1&nbsp;p.m., Lt. Schrier ordered the second flag raised and the first flag lowered. The four Marines and Pfc.

The [[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima|black and white photograph of the second flag raising]] by [[Joe Rosenthal]] of the [[Associated Press]] became world-famous after appearing in the newspapers as the flag raising on Iwo Jima.  Marine combat photographer Sergeant [[Bill Genaust|William Genaust]], who had accompanied Rosenthal and Marine photographer Pvt. Robert Campbell up Mount Suribachi, filmed the second flag raising in color and it was used in [[newsreel]]s.<ref name=\"youtube.com\">You Tube, Smithsonian Channel, 2008 Documentary (Genaust films) \"Shooting Iwo Jima\" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOy6yRAB6BY] Retrieved April 1, 2020</ref> Other combat photographers ascended the mountain after the first flag was raised and the mountaintop secured. These photographers including Rosenthal and an army photographer who was assigned to cover Marine amphibious landings for [[Yank, the Army Weekly|Yank Magazine]], took photos of Marines (including Sgt. Hansen), corpsmen, and themselves around both of the flags. The second flag-raisers received national recognition. After the replacement flag was raised, sixteen Marines, including Schrier and Hansen, and two Navy corpsmen ([[John Bradley (United States Navy)|John Bradley]] and Gerald Ziehme from the 40-man patrol) posed together for Rosenthal around the base of the flagstaff.\n\nOn February 27, Schrier left Mount Suribachi and became the commander of D Company, 2nd Battalion, 28th Marines. He was later awarded the [[Silver Star|Silver Star Medal]] for leading a successful counterattack on March 24 against a large number of fanatical Japanese soldiers who attacked the rear position of his lightly manned command post.\n\nOn March 14, another American flag was officially raised up a flagpole by two Marines under the orders of Lt. Gen. Holland Smith during a ceremony at the [[V Amphibious Corps]] command post on the other side of Mount Suribachi where the [[3rd Marine Division (United States)|3rd Marine Division]] troops were located. The flag flying on the summit of Mount Suribachi since February 23 was taken down. On March 26, 1945, the island was considered secure and the battle of Iwo Jima was officially ended. Lt. Schrier and the 28th Marines left Iwo Jima on March 27 and returned to Hawaii to the 5th Marine Division training camp. Lt. Col. Johnson was killed in action on March 2, Sgt. Genaust was killed on March 4, Sgt. Strank and Cpl. Block were killed on March 1, and Pfc. Sousley was killed on March 21.\n\nLt. Schrier served in San Diego from July to October 1945. Afterwards, he served in [[Seal Beach, California]], [[Samar]], [[Philippines]], and in [[United States Fleet Activities Yokosuka|Yokosuka]], [[Japan]]. In 1949, Captain Schrier returned to the United States and was assigned as a technical advisor (he also appeared as himself with flag raiser Ira Hayes and former corpsman John Bradley) in the motion picture ''[[Sands of Iwo Jima]]'', starring John Wayne.\n\n===Korean War===\nThe [[Korean War]] broke out on June 25, 1950, and Captain Schrier was sent to Korea with the [[1st Provisional Marine Brigade]] in July. He was awarded the [[Bronze Star Medal]] for his actions while serving as the brigade adjutant in August and September during the [[Battle of Pusan Perimeter]] in [[South Korea]]. He was assigned next as the company commander of I Company, [[3rd Battalion, 5th Marines]], [[1st Marine Division]]. During the [[Battle of Chosin Reservoir]] in [[North Korea]], he was wounded in the neck on December 1, during an all-night hill fight at Hill 1520 with Chinese Communist troops. He was evacuated to Japan.\n\n=== Marine Corps War Memorial ===\n[[File:USMC War Memorial Night.jpg|thumb|right|The [[USMC War Memorial|U.S. Marine Corps War Memorial]] in [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]], [[Virginia]]]]\n\nThe [[Marine Corps War Memorial]] (also known as the Iwo Jima Memorial) in Arlington, Virginia, which was inspired by Joe Rosenthal's photograph of the second flag-raising on Mount Suribachi by six Marines on February 23, 1945, was dedicated on November 10, 1954 (179th anniversary of the Marine Corps).<ref>[http://www.barracks.marines.mil/History/MarineCorpsWarMemorial.aspx Marine Corps War Memorial] Marine Barracks Washington, D.C.</ref> Schrier, Charles Lindberg, and Lou Lowery, from the patrol that raised the first flag on Mount Suribachi, attended the dedication ceremony as guests.\n\n[[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D.

On the morning of 23 February when his combat team had advanced to the base of Mount Suribachi after four days of severe fighting, First Lieutenant SCHRIER volunteered to lead a forty-man patrol up the steep slopes of the mountain. Quickly organizing his patrol and placing himself at its head, he began the tortuous climb up the side of the volcano, followed by his patrol in single file. Employing the only known approach, an old Japanese trail, he swiftly pushed on until, covered by all the supporting weapons of his battalion, he gained the top of the mountain despite hostile small arms and artillery fire. Forced to engage the remaining enemy in a sharp fire fight, he overcame them without loss in his patrol and occupied the rim of the volcano. Although still under enemy sniper fire, First Lieutenant SCHRIER, assisted by his Platoon Sergeant, raised the National Colors over Mount Suribachi, planting the flagstaff firmly on the highest knoll overlooking the crater, the first American flag to fly over any land in the inner defenses of the Japanese Empire. His inspiring leadership, courage and determination in the face of overwhelming odds upheld the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.\"\n<center>For the President,<br />JOHN L.

Realizing the seriousness of the situation when a group of approximately one hundred Japanese infiltrated through the main defensive positions shortly after midnight and launched a fanatical attack against the rear of his lightly-manned command post, First Lieutenant Schrier boldly rallied his men and opposed the onrushing enemy, setting a courageous example. His leadership and fighting spirit throughout this action were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service. For the President, John L.

Preceding the landing of our invasion forces, Second Lieutenant Schrier with his party made his way by canoe to the enemy-held Vangunu Island and for two days, in the face of extreme danger, stayed close to the hostile lines in order to observe troop concentrations, bivouac areas, possible gun positions and trails. When the other members of his party left, he dauntlessly remained in the Japanese-infested area and nine days later flashed signals to the approaching ships and guided troops to the beach. By his fearless devotion to duty in supplying accurate and vital information to the commanding officers, Second Lieutenant Schrier contributed materially to the capture of the area and upheld the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.\nGeneral Orders: Heroes U.S. Marine Corps, 1861 \u2013 1955: Jane Blakeney\nAction Date: June 13 \u2013 30, 1943\nService: Marine Corps\nRank: Second Lieutenant\nRegiment: 1st Marine Raider Regiment\n\nhttp://valor.militarytimes.com/recipient.php?recipientid=8139\n\n==Portrayal in films==\n* [[Sands of Iwo Jima]], 1949 (Capt.
