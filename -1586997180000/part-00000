At those [[legislative]] [[2000 Sudanese general election|elections]], in December 2000, the party won 355 out of 360 seats.

Known as a run stuffer, Hankins surprisingly showed flashes as a pass rusher recording 7 sacks, 6 QB hits and 21 hurries. Hankins exceeded expectations as he recorded 51 tackles, 7 sacks and a forced fumble and was named to Pro Football Focus' AllPro Team at Defensive Tackle.\n\nOn November 8, 2015, Hankins tore his pectoral muscle during the second quarter of the week 9 game against the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.giants.com/news/johnathan-hankins-out-for-season-with-pectoral-injury-16255384 |title=Johnathan Hankins out for season with pectoral injury |last=Eisen |first=Michael |date=November 9, 2015 |website=Giants.com |accessdate=December 10, 2015}}</ref> He was placed on season-ending injured reserve on November 10, 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.giants.com/news/giants-add-dt-montori-hughes-to-active-roster-johnathan-hankins-to-ir-16259355 |title=Giants add DT Montori Hughes to active roster; Johnathan Hankins to IR |last=Eisen |first=Michael |date=November 10, 2015 |website=Giants.com |accessdate=December 10, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2016 season, Hankins returned from his injury and recorded 3.0 sacks and 43 tackles.

The two  bumped into each another the very first month of their freshman year at the Ohio State University in 2010.

{"title_page": "Pupillary light reflex", "text_new": "[[File:Sepia eyelid shape.theora.ogv|thumb|right|250px|The W-shaped pupil of the cuttlefish dilating when the lights are turned off.]]\nThe '''pupillary light reflex''' ('''PLR''') or '''photopupillary reflex''' is a [[reflex]] that controls the diameter of the [[pupil]], in response to the intensity ([[luminance]]) of light that falls on the [[retinal ganglion cell]]s of the [[retina]] in the back of the [[eye]], thereby assisting in [[Adaptation (eye)|adaptation]] of vision to various levels of lightness/darkness. A greater intensity of light causes the pupil to constrict ([[miosis|miosis/myosis]]; thereby allowing less light in), whereas a lower intensity of light causes the pupil to dilate ([[mydriasis]], expansion; thereby allowing more light in). Thus, the pupillary light reflex regulates the intensity of light entering the eye.<ref name=\"Purves\" >{{cite book | author = Purves, Dale, George J. Augustine, David Fitzpatrick, William C. Hall, Anthony-Samuel LaMantia, James O. McNamara, and Leonard E. White | title = Neuroscience. 4th ed. | publisher = Sinauer Associates | pages = 290\u20131 | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-87893-697-7}}</ref> Light shone into one eye will cause both pupils to constrict.\n\n==Terminology==\nThe [[pupil]] is the dark circular opening in the center of the [[iris (anatomy)|iris]] and is where light enters the eye. By analogy with a camera, the pupil is equivalent to [[aperture]], whereas the iris is equivalent to the [[diaphragm (optics)|diaphragm]]. It may be helpful to consider the ''Pupillary reflex'' as an '''Iris' reflex'', as the iris [[Sphincter|sphincter]] and [[Iris dilator muscle|dilator]] muscles are what can be seen responding to ambient light.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hall |first1=Charlotte |last2=Chilcott |first2=Robert |title=Eyeing up the Future of the Pupillary Light Reflex in Neurodiagnostics |journal= Diagnostics|volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=19  |pmc=5872002 |year=2018 |pmid=29534018 |doi=10.3390/diagnostics8010019 }}</ref> Whereas, the pupil is the passive opening formed by the active iris.  Pupillary reflex is synonymous with pupillary response, which may be pupillary constriction or dilation. Pupillary reflex is conceptually linked to the side (left or right) of the reacting pupil, and not to the side from which light stimulation originates. Left pupillary reflex refers to the response of the left pupil to light, regardless of which eye is exposed to a light source. Right pupillary reflex means reaction of the right pupil, whether light is shone into the left eye, right eye, or both eyes. When light is shone into only one eye and not the other, it is normal for both pupils to constrict simultaneously. The terms ''direct'' and ''consensual'' refers to the side where the light source comes from, relative to the side of the reacting pupil. A direct pupillary reflex is pupillary response to light that enters the ipsilateral (same) eye. A consensual pupillary reflex is response of a pupil to light that enters the contralateral (opposite) eye. Thus there are four types of pupillary light reflexes, based on this terminology of absolute (left versus right) and relative (same side versus opposite side) laterality:\n# ''Left direct pupillary reflex'' is the left pupil's response to light entering the left eye, the ipsilateral eye.\n# ''Left consensual pupillary reflex'' is the left pupil's indirect response to light entering the right eye, the contralateral eye.\n# ''Right direct pupillary reflex'' is the right pupil's response to light entering the right eye, the ipsilateral eye.\n# ''Right consensual pupillary reflex'' is the right pupil's indirect response to light entering the left eye, the contralateral eye.\n\n==Neural pathway anatomy==\nThe pupillary light reflex neural pathway on each side has an afferent limb and two efferent limbs. The afferent limb has nerve fibers running within the optic nerve ([[CN II]]). Each efferent limb has nerve fibers running along the oculomotor nerve ([[CN III]]). The afferent limb carries sensory input. Anatomically, the afferent limb consists of the retina, the optic nerve, and the [[pretectal nucleus]] in the midbrain, at level of superior colliculus. Ganglion cells of the retina project fibers through the optic nerve to the ipsilateral pretectal nucleus. The efferent limb is the pupillary motor output from the pretectal nucleus to the ciliary sphincter muscle of the iris. The pretectal nucleus projects crossed and uncrossed fibers to the ipsilateral and contralateral [[Edinger-Westphal nuclei]], which are also located in the midbrain. Each Edinger-Westphal nucleus gives rise to preganglionic parasympathetic fibers which exit with CN III and synapse with postganglionic parasympathetic neurons in the ciliary ganglion. Postganglionic nerve fibers leave the ciliary ganglion to innervate the ciliary sphincter.<ref name=\"KaufmanLevin2011\">{{cite book|last1=Kaufman|first1=Paul L.|last2=Levin|first2=Leonard A.|last3=Alm|first3=Albert|title=Adler's Physiology of the Eye|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1oIlvnXnJvEC&pg=PA508|year=2011|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-0-323-05714-1|pages=508}}</ref> Each afferent limb has two efferent limbs, one ipsilateral and one contralateral. The ipsilateral efferent limb transmits nerve signals for direct light reflex of the ipsilateral pupil.

When the right eye is stimulated by light, left pupil does not constrict consensually. Right afferent limb is intact, but left efferent limb, left CN III, is damaged.\n\n===Lesion localization example===\nFor example, in a person with abnormal left direct reflex and abnormal right consensual reflex (with normal left consensual and normal right direct reflexes), which would produce a left [[Marcus Gunn pupil]], or what is called afferent pupillary defect, by physical examination:\n# Left consensual reflex is normal, therefore segments 2, 4, and 7 are normal. Lesion is not located in any of these segments.\n# Right direct reflex is normal, therefore segments 2, 6, and 8 are normal. Combining with earlier normals, segments 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8 are all normal. \n# Remaining segments where lesion may be located are segments 1, 3, and 5. Possible combinations and permutations are: (a) segment 1 only, (b) segment 3 only, (c) segment 5 only, (d) combination of segments 1 and 3, (e) combination of segments 1 and 5, (f) combination of segments 3 and 5, and (g) combination of segments 1, 3, and 5. \n# Options (b) and (c) are eliminated because isolated lesion in segment 3 alone or in segment 5 alone cannot produce the light reflex abnormalities in question.\n# A single lesion anywhere along segment 1, the left afferent limb, which includes the left retina, left optic nerve, and left pretectal nucleus, can produce the light reflex abnormalities observed. Examples of segment 1 pathologies include left optic neuritis (inflammation or infection of the left optic nerve), detachment of left retina, and an isolated small stroke involving only the left pretectal nucleus. Therefore, options (a), (d), (e), (f), and (g) are possible.\n# A combined lesion in segments 3 and 5 as cause of defect is very unlikely. Microscopically precise strokes in the midbrain, involving the left pretectal nucleus, bilateral Edinger-Westphal nuclei, and their interconnecting fibers, could theoretically produce this result. Furthermore, segment 4 shares the same anatomical space in the midbrain as segment 3, therefore segment 4 will likely be affected if segment 3 is damaged. In this setting, it is very unlikely that left consensual reflex, which requires an intact segment 4, would be preserved. Therefore, options (d), (f), and (g), which all includes segment 3, are eliminated. Remaining possible options are (a) and (e).\n# Based on the above reasoning, the lesion must involve segment 1. Damage to segment 5 may accompany a segment 1 lesion, but is unnecessary for producing the abnormal light reflex results in this case. Option (e) involves a combined lesion of segments 1 and 5. Multiple sclerosis, which often affects multiple neurologic sites simultaneously, could potentially cause this combination lesion. In all probability, option (a) is the answer. Neuro-imaging, such as MRI scan, would be useful for confirmation of clinical findings.\n\n==Cognitive influences==\nThe pupillary response to  light is not purely reflexive, but is modulated by cognitive factors, such as [[attention]], awareness, and the way visual input is interpreted. For example, if a bright stimulus is presented to one eye, and a dark stimulus to the other eye, perception alternates between the two eyes (i.e., [[binocular rivalry]]): Sometimes the dark stimulus is perceived, sometimes the bright stimulus, but never both at the same time. Using this technique, it has been shown the pupil is smaller when a bright stimulus dominates awareness, relative to when a dark stimulus dominates awareness.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF01854538 | author = Harms, H. | title = Ort und Wesen der Bildhemmung bei Schielenden | journal = Graefe's Archive for Clinical and Experimental Ophthalmology | volume = 138 | issue = 1 | pages = 149\u2013210 | year = 1937}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0020910 | author = Naber M., Frassle, S.

A greater intensity of light causes the pupil to constrict ([[miosis|miosis/myosis]]; thereby allowing less light in), whereas a lower intensity of light causes the pupil to dilate ([[mydriasis]], expansion; thereby allowing more light in).

By analogy with a camera, the pupil is equivalent to [[aperture]], whereas the iris is equivalent to the [[diaphragm (optics)|diaphragm]].

Whereas, the pupil is the passive opening formed by the active iris.  Pupillary reflex is synonymous with pupillary response, which may be pupillary constriction or dilation. Pupillary reflex is conceptually linked to the side (left or right) of the reacting pupil, and not to the side from which light stimulation originates. Left pupillary reflex refers to the response of the left pupil to light, regardless of which eye is exposed to a light source. Right pupillary reflex means reaction of the right pupil, whether light is shone into the left eye, right eye, or both eyes. When light is shone into only one eye and not the other, it is normal for both pupils to constrict simultaneously. The terms ''direct'' and ''consensual'' refers to the side where the light source comes from, relative to the side of the reacting pupil. A direct pupillary reflex is pupillary response to light that enters the ipsilateral (same) eye. A consensual pupillary reflex is response of a pupil to light that enters the contralateral (opposite) eye. Thus there are four types of pupillary light reflexes, based on this terminology of absolute (left versus right) and relative (same side versus opposite side) laterality:\n# ''Left direct pupillary reflex'' is the left pupil's response to light entering the left eye, the ipsilateral eye.\n# ''Left consensual pupillary reflex'' is the left pupil's indirect response to light entering the right eye, the contralateral eye.\n# ''Right direct pupillary reflex'' is the right pupil's response to light entering the right eye, the ipsilateral eye.\n# ''Right consensual pupillary reflex'' is the right pupil's indirect response to light entering the left eye, the contralateral eye.\n\n==Neural pathway anatomy==\nThe pupillary light reflex neural pathway on each side has an afferent limb and two efferent limbs. The afferent limb has nerve fibers running within the optic nerve ([[CN II]]). Each efferent limb has nerve fibers running along the oculomotor nerve ([[CN III]]). The afferent limb carries sensory input. Anatomically, the afferent limb consists of the retina, the optic nerve, and the [[pretectal nucleus]] in the midbrain, at level of superior colliculus. Ganglion cells of the retina project fibers through the optic nerve to the ipsilateral pretectal nucleus. The efferent limb is the pupillary motor output from the pretectal nucleus to the ciliary sphincter muscle of the iris. The pretectal nucleus projects crossed and uncrossed fibers to the ipsilateral and contralateral [[Edinger-Westphal nuclei]], which are also located in the midbrain. Each Edinger-Westphal nucleus gives rise to preganglionic parasympathetic fibers which exit with CN III and synapse with postganglionic parasympathetic neurons in the ciliary ganglion. Postganglionic nerve fibers leave the ciliary ganglion to innervate the ciliary sphincter.<ref name=\"KaufmanLevin2011\">{{cite book|last1=Kaufman|first1=Paul L.|last2=Levin|first2=Leonard A.|last3=Alm|first3=Albert|title=Adler's Physiology of the Eye|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1oIlvnXnJvEC&pg=PA508|year=2011|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-0-323-05714-1|pages=508}}</ref> Each afferent limb has two efferent limbs, one ipsilateral and one contralateral.

Consensual light reflex of left pupil involves the right optic nerve and left oculomotor nerve, which are both undamaged.\n*[[Oculomotor nerve]] damage on the left (e.g. transection of left oculomotor nerve, CN III, therefore damaging the left efferent limb) will have the following clinical findings: \n**The left direct reflex is lost. When the left eye is stimulated by light, left pupil does not constrict, because the efferent signals cannot pass from midbrain, through left CN III, to the left pupillary sphincter.\n**The right consensual reflex is intact. When the left eye is stimulated by light, the right pupil constricts, because the afferent limb on the left and the efferent limb on the right are both intact.\n**The right direct reflex is intact. When light is shone into right eye, right pupil constricts. Direct reflex of the right pupil is unaffected, The right afferent limb, right CN II, and the right efferent limb, right CN III, are both intact.\n**The left consensual reflex is lost. When the right eye is stimulated by light, left pupil does not constrict consensually. Right afferent limb is intact, but left efferent limb, left CN III, is damaged.\n\n===Lesion localization example===\nFor example, in a person with abnormal left direct reflex and abnormal right consensual reflex (with normal left consensual and normal right direct reflexes), which would produce a left [[Marcus Gunn pupil]], or what is called afferent pupillary defect, by physical examination:\n# Left consensual reflex is normal, therefore segments 2, 4, and 7 are normal. Lesion is not located in any of these segments.\n# Right direct reflex is normal, therefore segments 2, 6, and 8 are normal. Combining with earlier normals, segments 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8 are all normal. \n# Remaining segments where lesion may be located are segments 1, 3, and 5. Possible combinations and permutations are: (a) segment 1 only, (b) segment 3 only, (c) segment 5 only, (d) combination of segments 1 and 3, (e) combination of segments 1 and 5, (f) combination of segments 3 and 5, and (g) combination of segments 1, 3, and 5. \n# Options (b) and (c) are eliminated because isolated lesion in segment 3 alone or in segment 5 alone cannot produce the light reflex abnormalities in question.\n# A single lesion anywhere along segment 1, the left afferent limb, which includes the left retina, left optic nerve, and left pretectal nucleus, can produce the light reflex abnormalities observed. Examples of segment 1 pathologies include left optic neuritis (inflammation or infection of the left optic nerve), detachment of left retina, and an isolated small stroke involving only the left pretectal nucleus. Therefore, options (a), (d), (e), (f), and (g) are possible.\n# A combined lesion in segments 3 and 5 as cause of defect is very unlikely. Microscopically precise strokes in the midbrain, involving the left pretectal nucleus, bilateral Edinger-Westphal nuclei, and their interconnecting fibers, could theoretically produce this result. Furthermore, segment 4 shares the same anatomical space in the midbrain as segment 3, therefore segment 4 will likely be affected if segment 3 is damaged. In this setting, it is very unlikely that left consensual reflex, which requires an intact segment 4, would be preserved. Therefore, options (d), (f), and (g), which all includes segment 3, are eliminated. Remaining possible options are (a) and (e).\n# Based on the above reasoning, the lesion must involve segment 1. Damage to segment 5 may accompany a segment 1 lesion, but is unnecessary for producing the abnormal light reflex results in this case. Option (e) involves a combined lesion of segments 1 and 5. Multiple sclerosis, which often affects multiple neurologic sites simultaneously, could potentially cause this combination lesion. In all probability, option (a) is the answer. Neuro-imaging, such as MRI scan, would be useful for confirmation of clinical findings.\n\n==Cognitive influences==\nThe pupillary response to  light is not purely reflexive, but is modulated by cognitive factors, such as [[attention]], awareness, and the way visual input is interpreted. For example, if a bright stimulus is presented to one eye, and a dark stimulus to the other eye, perception alternates between the two eyes (i.e., [[binocular rivalry]]): Sometimes the dark stimulus is perceived, sometimes the bright stimulus, but never both at the same time. Using this technique, it has been shown the pupil is smaller when a bright stimulus dominates awareness, relative to when a dark stimulus dominates awareness.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF01854538 | author = Harms, H. | title = Ort und Wesen der Bildhemmung bei Schielenden | journal = Graefe's Archive for Clinical and Experimental Ophthalmology | volume = 138 | issue = 1 | pages = 149\u2013210 | year = 1937}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0020910 | author = Naber M., Frassle, S.

[[Antonio Fava]], a world-renowned maskmaker and Maestro of Commedia dell'arte is particularly fond of the character in both performance and study due to his influence and continuity throughout history. Of him, Fava explained that \"Pulcinella, a man without dignity, is nevertheless indespensable to us all: without [him] ... none of his countless 'bosses' could ever escape from the awkward tangle of troubles in which they find themselves. Pulcinella is everyone's saviour, saved by no one.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> This accidental helpfulness is key to his success. He goes out of his way to avoid responsibility, yet always ends up with more of it than he bargained for.\n\nHis movements are broad and laborious, allowing him to aggressively emphasize his speech and simultaneously exhausting him.

His nose varies, but is always the most prominent feature of the mask by far. It can be long and curved, hooking over the mouth, or it can be shorter, with a more bulbous bridge. But either way, the nose is to resemble that of a bird's beak.

He can have a protruding brow ridge, knitted brows, a furrowed brow, or simply raised eyebrows. No matter the implication behind them, it is simply important that they are deeply wrinkled and prominent enough to match the exaggerated style of commedia dell'arte masks.

Russian composer [[Igor Stravinsky]] composed two different ballets entitled [[Pulcinella (ballet)|''Pulcinella'']] and [[Petrushka (ballet)|''Petrushka'']], inspired by the character. However, in many of these adaptations, we saw Pulcinella as a puppet, as commedia dell'arte style theatre was not necessarily popular in the rest of the continent over time.

The primary starting point, operations and administration centre, main refreshment room (also selling souvenirs) and ticket purchasing are located at [[Belgrave (Puffing Billy) railway station|Belgrave station]]. Journeys may also be commenced at out-stations of which some have limited facilities for the purchase of tickets, refreshments and souvenirs. Tickets may also be purchased from the conductor before boarding the train.\n\n== General ==\nThe railway was originally one of five [[narrow gauge lines of the Victorian Railways]] opened around the beginning of the 20th century.  It runs through the southern foothills of the Dandenong Ranges to Gembrook.  Being close to the city of [[Melbourne]] and with a post-preservation history spanning over 50 years, the line is one of the most popular steam [[heritage railway]]s in the world,<ref>[http://esoteric-inkworks.tripod.com/friendsofthetrestlebridge/ Friends of the Trestle Bridge, Puffing Billy, Sherbrooke<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and attracts tourists from all over Australia and overseas.\n\nThe Puffing Billy Railway is kept in operation through the efforts of volunteers of the Puffing Billy Preservation Society, although intensive year-round operations have led to a few dozen paid employees to keep things going behind the scenes.\n\nThe railway aims to preserve and restore the line as near as possible to how it was in the first three decades of its existence, but with particular emphasis on the early 1920s.\n\n== Operation ==\n[[File:Victorian Railways nA class 2-6-2 7A at Menzies Creek.jpg|thumb|right|V.R. NA Class 7A at Menzies Creek on 12 April 1971 with fireman clearing ash from the smokebox]]\nOperations are centred on [[Belgrave (Puffing Billy) railway station|Belgrave]], which houses the main offices of the railway (other offices are located at [[Emerald, Victoria|Emerald]]) as well as the locomotive running shed and locomotive workshops.  It is also the base for track maintenance operations.\n\nMost trains start from Belgrave and travel to [[Lakeside railway station, Melbourne|Lakeside]], or to the terminus at [[Gembrook railway station|Gembrook]], and return.  The railway operates every day of the year except Christmas Day, with at least three and up to six advertised services departing Belgrave each day.  One service each day has the option of first-class carriages and [[lunch]].\n\nA semi-regular service is the ''Dinner Train'', which usually departs Belgrave on a Friday or Saturday evening and travels to [[Nobelius Siding]], where the passengers disembark and have a sit-down [[dinner]] in the converted packing shed of the former Nobelius Nursery.  After the meal, the passengers rejoin the train for the return journey to Belgrave.  Savouries and drinks are served on the train.\n\nOnce or twice a month, these Dinner Trains also incorporate a themed evening known as \"Murder on the Puffing Billy Express\". Passengers are encouraged to dress in 1920s-era costume and participate in a murder mystery which involves actors on board the train and concluding during the meal at Nobelius Siding. Prizes are on offer to guests who guess the murderer as well as best-dressed prizes.\n\nA popular feature of a ride on Puffing Billy is sitting on the ledge of the open-sided carriages (see picture). As a result of a crash between a train and a minibus at the Menzies Creek level crossing on 5 March 2018<ref>http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-06/puffing-billy-crash-at-menzies-creek/9518658</ref>, this practice has been prohibited until further notice.<ref>http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/puffing-billy-collides-with-bus/news-story/e01682283994501147bc06cea98debb2</ref>\n\nThere is also a narrow gauge railway museum adjacent to Menzies Creek station, which is currently closed for re-development.\n\n== Locomotives and rolling stock ==\n{{See also|Narrow gauge lines of the Victorian Railways#Locomotives and rolling stock|l1=Victorian Railways}}\n\n=== Locomotives ===\nThe railway owns every remaining narrow gauge locomotive of the former [[Victorian Railways]], and has restored to operating condition all except one, although not all are in serviceable condition at any one time.  This fleet comprises five restored and one unrestored [[2-6-2]]T [[Victorian Railways NA class|<small>N</small>A class locomotives]] (3A is unrestored, while 6A, 7A, 8A, 12A and 14A have all been restored), and one [[Victorian Railways G class|G class]] [[Garratt]] (G 42) locomotive.  All are restored, or being restored, to represent different eras in their working life.\n\nIn December 2019 a completely rebuilt and re-gauged [[South African Class NG G16 2-6-2+2-6-2|NG/G16 Garratt locomotive]] (NG129) originally imported from South Africa in 1996 entered service on the railway to complement the operational capabilities of the [[Victorian Railways G class|G class]] [[Garratt]] (G 42) locomotive.  The two Garratt locomotives (G42 and NG129) can haul up to 16 carriages in a train whereas the NA class locomotives are limited to pulling 8 to 10 carriages.\n\nThe railway also has a number of other smaller steam locomotives from various sources in its museum collection, either on static display or in operating condition. These include a [[Peckett and Sons|Peckett]] 0-4-0ST and [[Decauville]] 0-4-0T formerly from the [[West Melbourne Gasworks]], and a [[Climax locomotive|Climax]] [[Geared steam locomotive|geared locomotive]] from the [[Tyers Valley Tramway]]. None of these locomotives are powerful or fast enough to operate on regular services, however they can occasionally be seen on special trains and at events such as [[Thomas the Tank Engine]] days.\n\nPuffing Billy also offers driver experience days on the smaller steam engines. The Climax engine has been restored for this purpose as this engine has a commodious driving cab and is unique in Australia.\n\nThe railway also operates three diesel locomotives which are used on days of total fire ban, plant or works trains, or when insufficient steam locomotives are available, including in emergencies.

However, there are also a number of enclosed carriages, both saloon and compartment cars.  In addition, four carriages were obtained from the [[Mount Lyell Railway]] in Tasmania after its closure in 1963, and regauged and reclassified for Puffing Billy use, numbered 1\u20134NAL. They are named Mt Lyell, Double Barril, Rinadeena & Teepookana to reflect their Tasmanian Heritage. These vehicles are now used as first-class carriages and used primarily on the Luncheon train and Dinner train.\n\nSeveral carriages have been temporarily converted to include a guard's compartment. A number of '''NQR''' low-sided goods trucks have also been modified for passenger use, making them similar to the '''NBH''' carriages.  Another three '''NQR''' trucks have been fitted with seats but no roof and are only used during the summer peak season.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Number\n!Image\n!Year built\n!Builder\n!Status\n!Notes\n|-\n| NB\n| [[File:NB1.JPG|150px]]\n| \n| \n| \n| \n|-\n|}\n\n=== Goods vehicles and brake vans ===\nRepresentatives of all classes of goods vehicles and brake vans (including combined brake van and passenger carriage) used on the narrow gauge lines of the Victorian Railways are to be found on the Puffing Billy line, and are used for works trains, storage, and occasional heritage trains recreating the look of trains in the 1920s.\n\n== Structure ==\n[[File:Monbulk Creek Trestle Bridge.JPG|thumb|The Monbulk Creek Trestle Bridge.]]\n[[File:20150925 Puffing Billy at Monbulk Creek trestle bridge.ogv|thumb|Puffing Billy crosses the Monbulk Creek trestle bridge.]]\n\n=== Puffing Billy Preservation Society ===\nWhen the '''Puffing Billy Preservation Society''' was formed in 1955, the line was still under the control and ownership of the Victorian Railways (VR).  The Society arranged for the VR to run the train on weekends and holidays, with the Society guaranteeing the VR against losses from insufficient ticket sales.  Society volunteers took the role of conductors, checking tickets on the train, and fund-raising.  This arrangement continued until the Upper Ferntree Gully to Belgrave section was closed in 1958.\n\nWhen the line reopened in 1962 (between Belgrave and Menzies Creek), Society volunteers took a larger role, manning stations, selling and checking tickets, and doing non-safety-critical maintenance on the train, and track maintenance under the supervision of a VR ganger.  Ticket revenue went into an account on which the VR drew to pay for their staff involved in running the line.\n\n=== Emerald Tourist Railway Board ===\nThe Victorian Railways were not in the preservation business, and the arrangement was less than ideal, so in 1977 the [[Government of Victoria|Victorian Government]] passed the Emerald Tourist Railway Act 1977 (No. 9020) to set up the '''Emerald Tourist Railway Board''' as a statutory authority to take over ownership and operation of the railway from the VR.  The Act requires that the Board have between five and ten members, four of which are to be nominated by the Puffing Billy Preservation Society.  Successive governments have had sufficient confidence in the Board that they have never appointed their full entitlement, effectively leaving control of the Board in the hands of Society nominees.\n\nWith the Board, volunteers were now able to take on more responsible roles, including filling the positions of signalmen, guards, and firemen, and later drivers, although the Board does employ staff drivers to provide the core of the driving tasks.  All volunteers filling responsible positions are required to undergo training and testing in their responsibilities.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Puffing billy in action 2003.jpg|thumb|Locomotive 12A on the famous Monbulk creek trestle bridge near Belgrave.]]\n\n=== Pre-preservation ===\nThe line was opened in 1900 to serve the local [[Agriculture|farming]] and [[timber]] community.  It originally ran from [[Upper Ferntree Gully railway station|Upper Ferntree Gully station]], the terminus of the [[broad gauge]] line from [[Melbourne]] and now part of [[Railways in Melbourne|Melbourne's suburban railway system]], but it now begins at [[Belgrave, Victoria|Belgrave]].\n\nThe train, known to the locals as \"Puffing Billy\" amongst other names, stopped running in 1953 after a landslide blocked the line between [[Selby railway station, Melbourne|Selby]] and [[Menzies Creek railway station|Menzies Creek]], and it was formally closed in 1954.<ref>'''''Reminiscences of the Upper Ferntree Gully\u2013Gembrook Narrow Gauge Line''''' Clark, M.H.W. [[Australian Railway History|Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin]], April, 1980 pp69-83</ref>  Today the former line between Upper Ferntree Gully and Belgrave is serviced by [[Metro Trains Melbourne]] suburban electric trains, while the line beyond Belgrave has been reopened by the Puffing Billy Preservation Society.\n\nAt the end of 1954, the railways desired a scheme to minimise their financial risks if the train was to run indefinitely. Harold L. Hewett, a teacher at Melbourne Grammar School, was the driving force behind a small group of people who organised a rally attended by 400 people at Upper Ferntree Gully station on 4 January 1955 to try to save the train\n\n=== Post-preservation ===\nFollowing closure, a few \"farewell specials\" operated on the remaining usable section to Belgrave, which proved very popular.  On 1 October 1955, the '''Puffing Billy Preservation Society''' was formed to keep the train running indefinitely.  This continued until 1958 when the line to Belgrave was closed for conversion to a broad gauge, electrified suburban line.  The society then started work on restoring the Belgrave to [[Lakeside railway station, Melbourne|Lakeside]] section, and on 28 July 1962, restored train operation between Belgrave and [[Menzies Creek railway station|Menzies Creek]].\n\n[[Rover Scouts]] attending the 7th World Rover Moot held at Wonga Park assisted in the clearing of the line between Belgrave and Menzies Creek as part of the event's community service component.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Milne|first1=A.

In the 2016/17 financial year, Puffing Billy carried 487,237 passengers, up more than 60,000 from the previous financial year.\n\n=== Scandal ===\nIn 2014, Robert Whitehead, a long-serving volunteer on the railway, was convicted of multiple sexual offences against young boys.

Although there are also paid staff involved in maintaining the train and its line, performing support roles such as accounting and advertising, and providing the backbone of the driving duties, volunteers are involved in almost all aspects of running the train including manning stations, selling tickets, maintaining the track and trains, driving and other [[safeworking]] duties such as acting as fireman and guard on the trains and signalman at some stations. Volunteers also help to maintain buildings, grounds and stations.  Many of these roles involve being trained for positions of responsibility.\n\nIn line with the policy of representing the 1900\u20131930 era, the roles carried out by the volunteers use traditional Victorian Railways titles such as those listed below:\u2014\n* [[rail terminology#S|Station-master]]\n* [[rail terminology#B|Booking Clerk]] {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|k|l|\u0251r|k}}<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/clerk / Dictionary.com]</ref>\n* [[rail terminology#P|Porter]]\n* [[rail terminology#C|Conductor]]\n* [[rail terminology#D|Driver]]\n* [[rail terminology#F|Fireman]]\n* [[rail terminology#G|Guard]]\n* [[rail terminology#S|Signalman]]\n* [[rail terminology#S|Steward]]\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\n=== Television ===\n[[Solo One]] was a TV police drama series produced by [[Crawford Productions]] that screened in 1976, filmed and set in [[Emerald, Victoria]], about a local (fictional) policeman dealing with crime in the town, however it was aimed at a younger audience than most Australian TV police dramas. It featured Puffing Billy in the opening credits scene as well as being part of most story-lines.\n\nThe ABC children's drama ''Come Midnight Monday'' was filmed in and around Belgrave, Emerald & Cockatoo and featuring Puffing Billy locomotive 12A\u2014renamed \"Wombat\"\u2014as the main character.\n\nFilming of ''[[A Country Practice]]'' in the fictional town of Wandin Valley (the towns of Wandin, Wandin North and Wandin East are however 30km north of Emerald) was moved to Emerald when the show moved to [[Network Ten]], and occasionally featured Puffing Billy.\n\nThe 1966 television special ''The Seekers at Home'' filmed a segment at Puffing Billy, where [[the Seekers]] sing \"Morningtown Ride\" to a group of children.<ref>http://www.allmusic.com/album/at-home-and-down-under-mw0001082354</ref>\n\nIn 1997, the soap opera ''[[Neighbours]]'' filmed scenes set on and around the train. The characters of [[Darren Stark]] and [[Libby Kennedy]] lost young [[Louise Carpenter]] and chased after the train en route to Belgrave on a motorbike to catch up with her after discovering she had boarded it.\n\n=== Books ===\nA couple of children's story-books have been published featuring Puffing Billy, telling the story of its rescue, but with a great deal of artistic license.\n\n== Line guide ==\n{{Puffing Billy Railway}}\n\nRegular Puffing Billy services usually only stop at stations shown in '''bold print''' at the right.

The primary starting point, operations and administration centre, main refreshment room (also selling souvenirs) and ticket purchasing are located at [[Belgrave (Puffing Billy) railway station|Belgrave station]]. Journeys may also be commenced at out-stations of which some have limited facilities for the purchase of tickets, refreshments and souvenirs. Tickets may also be purchased from the conductor before boarding the train.\n\n== General ==\nThe railway was originally one of five [[narrow gauge lines of the Victorian Railways]] opened around the beginning of the 20th century.  It runs through the southern foothills of the Dandenong Ranges to Gembrook.  Being close to the city of [[Melbourne]] and with a post-preservation history spanning over 50 years, the line is one of the most popular steam [[heritage railway]]s in the world,<ref>[http://esoteric-inkworks.tripod.com/friendsofthetrestlebridge/ Friends of the Trestle Bridge, Puffing Billy, Sherbrooke<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and attracts tourists from all over Australia and overseas.\n\nThe Puffing Billy Railway is kept in operation through the efforts of volunteers of the Puffing Billy Preservation Society, although intensive year-round operations have led to a few dozen paid employees to keep things going behind the scenes.\n\nThe railway aims to preserve and restore the line as near as possible to how it was in the first three decades of its existence, but with particular emphasis on the early 1920s.\n\n== Operation ==\n[[File:Victorian Railways nA class 2-6-2 7A at Menzies Creek.jpg|thumb|right|V.R. NA Class 7A at Menzies Creek on 12 April 1971 with fireman clearing ash from the smokebox]]\nOperations are centred on [[Belgrave (Puffing Billy) railway station|Belgrave]], which houses the main offices of the railway (other offices are located at [[Emerald, Victoria|Emerald]]) as well as the locomotive running shed and locomotive workshops.  It is also the base for track maintenance operations.\n\nMost trains start from Belgrave and travel to [[Lakeside railway station, Melbourne|Lakeside]], or to the terminus at [[Gembrook railway station|Gembrook]], and return.  The railway operates every day of the year except Christmas Day, with at least three and up to six advertised services departing Belgrave each day.  One service each day has the option of first-class carriages and [[lunch]].\n\nA semi-regular service is the ''Dinner Train'', which usually departs Belgrave on a Friday or Saturday evening and travels to [[Nobelius Siding]], where the passengers disembark and have a sit-down [[dinner]] in the converted packing shed of the former Nobelius Nursery.  After the meal, the passengers rejoin the train for the return journey to Belgrave.  Savouries and drinks are served on the train.\n\nOnce or twice a month, these Dinner Trains also incorporate a themed evening known as \"Murder on the Puffing Billy Express\". Passengers are encouraged to dress in 1920s-era costume and participate in a murder mystery which involves actors on board the train and concluding during the meal at Nobelius Siding. Prizes are on offer to guests who guess the murderer as well as best-dressed prizes.\n\nA popular feature of a ride on Puffing Billy is sitting on the ledge of the open-sided carriages (see picture). As a result of a crash between a train and a minibus at the Menzies Creek level crossing on 5 March 2018<ref>http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-06/puffing-billy-crash-at-menzies-creek/9518658</ref>, this practice has been prohibited until further notice<ref>http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/puffing-billy-collides-with-bus/news-story/e01682283994501147bc06cea98debb2</ref>.\n\nThere is also a narrow gauge railway museum adjacent to Menzies Creek station, which is currently closed for re-development.\n\n== Locomotives and rolling stock ==\n{{See also|Narrow gauge lines of the Victorian Railways#Locomotives and rolling stock|l1=Victorian Railways}}\n\n=== Locomotives ===\nThe railway owns every remaining narrow gauge locomotive of the former [[Victorian Railways]], and has restored to operating condition all except one, although not all are in serviceable condition at any one time.  This fleet comprises five restored and one unrestored [[2-6-2]]T [[Victorian Railways NA class|<small>N</small>A class locomotives]] (3A is unrestored, while 6A, 7A, 8A, 12A and 14A have all been restored), and one [[Victorian Railways G class|G class]] [[Garratt]] (G 42) locomotive.  All are restored, or being restored, to represent different eras in their working life.\n\nIn December 2019 a completely rebuilt and re-gauged [[South African Class NG G16 2-6-2+2-6-2|NG/G16 Garratt locomotive]] (NG129) originally imported from South Africa in 1996 entered service on the railway to complement the operational capabilities of the [[Victorian Railways G class|G class]] [[Garratt]] (G 42) locomotive.  The two Garratt locomotives (G42 and NG129) can haul up to 16 carriages in a train whereas the NA class locomotives are limited to pulling 8 to 10 carriages.\n\nThe railway also has a number of other smaller steam locomotives from various sources in its museum collection, either on static display or in operating condition. These include a [[Peckett and Sons|Peckett]] 0-4-0ST and [[Decauville]] 0-4-0T formerly from the [[West Melbourne Gasworks]], and a [[Climax locomotive|Climax]] [[Geared steam locomotive|geared locomotive]] from the [[Tyers Valley Tramway]]. None of these locomotives are powerful or fast enough to operate on regular services, however they can occasionally be seen on special trains and at events such as [[Thomas the Tank Engine]] days.\n\nPuffing Billy also offers driver experience days on the smaller steam engines. The Climax engine has been restored for this purpose as this engine has a commodious driving cab and is unique in Australia.\n\nThe railway also operates three diesel locomotives which are used on days of total fire ban, plant or works trains, or when insufficient steam locomotives are available, including in emergencies.  The diesel locomotives originally operated on railways in Tasmania (D21, formerly V12) and Queensland (D<small>H</small>5, formerly DH5 and later CC02, and D<small>H</small>31, formerly DH59), and were regauged and rebuilt for use on the Puffing Billy Railway.\n\nThere is also a diesel [[rail terminology#R|Rail Tractor]] (<small>N</small>RT 1) used mainly for shunting rolling stock in association with the Carriage Workshops.\n\n==== VR Original ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Image\n!Number\n!Type\n!Builder\n!Serial<br>number\n!Year built\n!Status\n!Notes\n|-\n| \n| 3A\n| [[Victorian Railways NA class|<small>N</small>A class]]<br>[[2-6-2T]]\n| [[Newport Workshops]]\n|\n| 1900\n| ''Stored''\n| The first of the VR-built [[Victorian Railways NA class|<small>N</small>A class locomotives]], built at the [[Victorian Railways]] [[Newport Workshops]], utilising spare parts supplied with [[Baldwin Locomotive Works|Baldwin]]-built 1A.

However, there are also a number of enclosed carriages, both saloon and compartment cars.  In addition, four carriages were obtained from the [[Mount Lyell Railway]] in Tasmania after its closure in 1963, and regauged and reclassified for Puffing Billy use, numbered 1\u20134NAL. They are named Mt Lyell, Double Barril, Rinadeena & Teepookana to reflect their Tasmanian Heritage. These vehicles are now used as first-class carriages and used primarily on the Luncheon train and Dinner train.\n\nSeveral carriages have been temporarily converted to include a guard's compartment. A number of '''NQR''' low-sided goods trucks have also been modified for passenger use, making them similar to the '''NBH''' carriages.  Another three '''NQR''' trucks have been fitted with seats but no roof and are only used during the summer peak season.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Number\n!Image\n!Year built\n!Builder\n!Status\n!Notes\n|-\n| NB\n| [[File:NB1.JPG|150px]]\n| \n| \n| \n| \n|-\n|}\n\n=== Goods vehicles and brake vans ===\nRepresentatives of all classes of goods vehicles and brake vans (including combined brake van and passenger carriage) used on the narrow gauge lines of the Victorian Railways are to be found on the Puffing Billy line, and are used for works trains, storage, and occasional heritage trains recreating the look of trains in the 1920s.\n\n== Structure ==\n[[File:Monbulk Creek Trestle Bridge.JPG|thumb|The Monbulk Creek Trestle Bridge.]]\n[[File:20150925 Puffing Billy at Monbulk Creek trestle bridge.ogv|thumb|Puffing Billy crosses the Monbulk Creek trestle bridge.]]\n\n=== Puffing Billy Preservation Society ===\nWhen the '''Puffing Billy Preservation Society''' was formed in 1955, the line was still under the control and ownership of the Victorian Railways (VR).  The Society arranged for the VR to run the train on weekends and holidays, with the Society guaranteeing the VR against losses from insufficient ticket sales.  Society volunteers took the role of conductors, checking tickets on the train, and fund-raising.  This arrangement continued until the Upper Ferntree Gully to Belgrave section was closed in 1958.\n\nWhen the line reopened in 1962 (between Belgrave and Menzies Creek), Society volunteers took a larger role, manning stations, selling and checking tickets, and doing non-safety-critical maintenance on the train, and track maintenance under the supervision of a VR ganger.  Ticket revenue went into an account on which the VR drew to pay for their staff involved in running the line.\n\n=== Emerald Tourist Railway Board ===\nThe Victorian Railways were not in the preservation business, and the arrangement was less than ideal, so in 1977 the [[Government of Victoria|Victorian Government]] passed the Emerald Tourist Railway Act 1977 (No. 9020) to set up the '''Emerald Tourist Railway Board''' as a statutory authority to take over ownership and operation of the railway from the VR.  The Act requires that the Board have between five and ten members, four of which are to be nominated by the Puffing Billy Preservation Society.  Successive governments have had sufficient confidence in the Board that they have never appointed their full entitlement, effectively leaving control of the Board in the hands of Society nominees.\n\nWith the Board, volunteers were now able to take on more responsible roles, including filling the positions of signalmen, guards, and firemen, and later drivers, although the Board does employ staff drivers to provide the core of the driving tasks.  All volunteers filling responsible positions are required to undergo training and testing in their responsibilities.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Puffing billy in action 2003.jpg|thumb|Locomotive 12A on the famous Monbulk creek trestle bridge near Belgrave.]]\n\n=== Pre-preservation ===\nThe line was opened in 1900 to serve the local [[Agriculture|farming]] and [[timber]] community.  It originally ran from [[Upper Ferntree Gully railway station|Upper Ferntree Gully station]], the terminus of the [[broad gauge]] line from [[Melbourne]] and now part of [[Railways in Melbourne|Melbourne's suburban railway system]], but it now begins at [[Belgrave, Victoria|Belgrave]].\n\nThe train, known to the locals as \"Puffing Billy\" amongst other names, stopped running in 1953 after a landslide blocked the line between [[Selby railway station, Melbourne|Selby]] and [[Menzies Creek railway station|Menzies Creek]], and it was formally closed in 1954.<ref>'''''Reminiscences of the Upper Ferntree Gully\u2013Gembrook Narrow Gauge Line''''' Clark, M.H.W. [[Australian Railway History|Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin]], April, 1980 pp69-83</ref>  Today the former line between Upper Ferntree Gully and Belgrave is serviced by [[Metro Trains Melbourne]] suburban electric trains, while the line beyond Belgrave has been reopened by the Puffing Billy Preservation Society.\n\nAt the end of 1954, the railways desired a scheme to minimise their financial risks if the train was to run indefinitely. Harold L. Hewett, a teacher at Melbourne Grammar School, was the driving force behind a small group of people who organised a rally attended by 400 people at Upper Ferntree Gully station on 4 January 1955 to try to save the train\n\n=== Post-preservation ===\nFollowing closure, a few \"farewell specials\" operated on the remaining usable section to Belgrave, which proved very popular.  On 1 October 1955, the '''Puffing Billy Preservation Society''' was formed to keep the train running indefinitely.  This continued until 1958 when the line to Belgrave was closed for conversion to a broad gauge, electrified suburban line.  The society then started work on restoring the Belgrave to [[Lakeside railway station, Melbourne|Lakeside]] section, and on 28 July 1962, restored train operation between Belgrave and [[Menzies Creek railway station|Menzies Creek]].\n\n[[Rover Scouts]] attending the 7th World Rover Moot held at Wonga Park assisted in the clearing of the line between Belgrave and Menzies Creek as part of the event's community service component.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Milne|first1=A.

In the 2016/17 financial year, Puffing Billy carried 487,237 passengers, up more than 60,000 from the previous financial year.\n\n=== Scandal ===\nIn 2014, Robert Whitehead, a long-serving volunteer on the railway, was convicted of multiple sexual offences against young boys. He died in prison in 2015, while serving a sentence of more than 8 years.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/law-order/robert-whitehead-puffing-billy-paedophile-jailed-for-child-sex-attacks/news-story/827a22f65d415ee1c01d1a919fda5775?nk=f676f2d7b7150cf239932480a3138128-1539829723 |title=Robert Whitehead, Puffing Billy paedophile jailed for child sex attacks |publisher=Herald Sun |first=Wayne |last=Flower |date=23 July 2015}}</ref> Whitehead had been convicted and jailed in 1959 of molesting a [[boy scout]], but returned to his job on the railways at the request of Sir [[Murray Porter]].

Although there are also paid staff involved in maintaining the train and its line, performing support roles such as accounting and advertising, and providing the backbone of the driving duties, volunteers are involved in almost all aspects of running the train including manning stations, selling tickets, maintaining the track and trains, driving and other [[safeworking]] duties such as acting as fireman and guard on the trains and signalman at some stations. Volunteers also help to maintain buildings, grounds and stations.  Many of these roles involve being trained for positions of responsibility.\n\nIn line with the policy of representing the 1900\u20131930 era, the roles carried out by the volunteers use traditional Victorian Railways titles such as those listed below:\u2014\n* [[rail terminology#S|Station-master]]\n* [[rail terminology#B|Booking Clerk]] {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|k|l|\u0251r|k}}<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/clerk / Dictionary.com]</ref>\n* [[rail terminology#P|Porter]]\n* [[rail terminology#C|Conductor]]\n* [[rail terminology#D|Driver]]\n* [[rail terminology#F|Fireman]]\n* [[rail terminology#G|Guard]]\n* [[rail terminology#S|Signalman]]\n* [[rail terminology#S|Steward]]\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\n=== Television ===\n[[Solo One]] was a TV police drama series produced by [[Crawford Productions]] that screened in 1976, filmed and set in [[Emerald, Victoria]], about a local (fictional) policeman dealing with crime in the town, however it was aimed at a younger audience than most Australian TV police dramas. It featured Puffing Billy in the opening credits scene as well as being part of most story-lines.\n\nThe ABC children's drama ''Come Midnight Monday'' was filmed in and around Belgrave, Emerald & Cockatoo and featuring Puffing Billy locomotive 12A\u2014renamed \"Wombat\"\u2014as the main character.\n\nFilming of ''[[A Country Practice]]'' in the fictional town of Wandin Valley (the towns of Wandin, Wandin North and Wandin East are however 30km north of Emerald) was moved to Emerald when the show moved to [[Network Ten]], and occasionally featured Puffing Billy.\n\nThe 1966 television special ''The Seekers at Home'' filmed a segment at Puffing Billy, where [[the Seekers]] sing \"Morningtown Ride\" to a group of children.<ref>http://www.allmusic.com/album/at-home-and-down-under-mw0001082354</ref>\n\nIn 1997, the soap opera ''[[Neighbours]]'' filmed scenes set on and around the train. The characters of [[Darren Stark]] and [[Libby Kennedy]] lost young [[Louise Carpenter]] and chased after the train en route to Belgrave on a motorbike to catch up with her after discovering she had boarded it.\n\n=== Books ===\nA couple of children's story-books have been published featuring Puffing Billy, telling the story of its rescue, but with a great deal of artistic license.\n\n== Line guide ==\n{{Puffing Billy Railway}}\n\nRegular Puffing Billy services usually only stop at stations shown in '''bold print''' at the right.
